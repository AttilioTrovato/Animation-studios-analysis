1
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,790
You know, there's been a heap of legends[br]and tall tales about Robin Hood.

2
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,840
All different too.

3
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,260
Well, we folks of the animal kingdom[br]have our own version.

4
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:50,680
It's the story of what really happened[br]in Sherwood Forest.

5
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:37,910
Oh, incidentally,[br]I'm Allan-A-Dale, a minstrel.

6
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:40,200
That's an early-day folk singer.

7
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:45,440
And my job is to tell it like it is[br]or was or whatever.

8
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,550
Robin Hood and LittleJohn[br]walkin'through the forest

9
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:56,380
Laughin'back and forth[br]at what the other one has to say

10
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:00,880
Reminiscin'this and that[br]and havin'such a good time

11
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:04,330
Oo- de-lally, oo-de-lally[br]Golly, what a day

12
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:10,190
Never ever thinkin'there was danger[br]in the water they were drinkin'

13
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:12,680
They just guzzled it down

14
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:15,400
Never dreamin'[br]that a schemin'sheriff and his posse

15
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:20,300
Was a-watchin'them[br]and gatherin'around

16
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,240
Robin Hood and LittleJohn[br]runnin'through the forest

17
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:27,190
Jumpin'fences, dodgin'trees[br]and tryin'to get away

18
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:32,080
Contemplatin'nothin'but escape[br]and finally makin'it

19
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,780
Oo- de-lally, oo-de-lally[br]Golly, what a day

20
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:43,040
Oo- de-lally, oo-de-lally[br]Golly, what a day

21
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:46,380
You know somethin', Robin?[br]You're takin' too many chances.

22
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:50,050
Chances? You must be joking.

23
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,920
That was just a bit[br]of a lark, Little John.

24
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:54,730
Yeah? Take a look at your hat.

25
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,940
That's not a candle on a cake.

26
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:00,720
Hello. This one almost[br]had my name on it, didn't it?

27
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,600
They're getting better,[br]you know.

28
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:05,520
You've got to admit it.[br]They are getting better.

29
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,100
Uh, yeah. The next time that sheriff'll[br]probably have a rope around our necks.

30
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,410
Pretty hard to laugh[br]hangin' there, Rob.

31
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:17,160
Ha! The sheriff and his whole posse[br]couldn't lift you off the ground.

32
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,410
On guard!

33
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:21,440
Hey, watch it, Rob.[br]That's the only hat I've got.

34
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:24,740
Oh, come along.[br]You worry too much, old boy.

35
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,080
You know somethin', Robin,[br]I was just wonderin'?

36
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,580
Are we good guys or bad guys?

37
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:33,620
You know, I mean, uh...[br]Our robbin' the rich to feed the poor.

38
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:37,550
Rob? That's a naughty word.[br]We never rob.

39
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:41,770
We just sort of borrow a bit[br]from those who can afford it.

40
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:45,380
"Borrow"?[br]Huh. Boy, are we in debt.

41
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:59,070
That sounds like another collection day[br]for the poor, eh, Johnny boy?

42
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,240
Yeah. Sweet charity.

43
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,130
Taxes!

44
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:43,180
Taxes! Beautiful, lovely taxes!

45
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:48,200
S-Sire, you have[br]an absolute skill...

46
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,140
for encouraging[br]contributions from the poor.

47
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,480
To coin a phrase,[br]my dear counsellor:

48
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:57,170
"Rob the poor[br]to feed the rich."

49
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,820
Am I right?

50
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:03,120
Tell me. What is the next stop,[br]uh, Sir Hiss?

51
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:05,280
Uh, let me see, uh... Ooh!

52
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:08,630
Yes, the next stop[br]is Nottingham, sire.

53
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:11,540
Oh! The richest plum[br]of them all.

54
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:14,800
Notting... ham.

55
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:20,500
A perfect fit, sire.[br]Most becoming.

56
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,420
You look regal, dignified...

57
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:25,180
sincere, masterful,[br]noble, chival...

58
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,340
D-D-D-D-Don't overdo it, Hiss.

59
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,980
There.[br]That, I believe, does it.

60
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:38,060
This crown gives me[br]a feeling of power! Power!

61
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:40,110
Forgive me a cruel chuckle.

62
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:43,400
Mm. Power. Hmm.

63
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,900
And how well King Richard's crown[br]sits on your noble brow.

64
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,240
Doesn't it?[br]Uh, King Richard?

65
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:55,950
I've told you never[br]to mention my brother's name.

66
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,830
A-A mere slip of the forked tongue,[br]Your Majesty.

67
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:02,760
We're in this plot together,[br]if you don't mind my saying so.

68
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,930
And remember, it was your idea[br]I hypnotized him, and...

69
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:11,170
Ah-ah, I know.[br]And sent him off on that crazy crusade.

70
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,720
Much to the sorrow[br]of the Queen Mother.

71
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:19,020
Yeah. Mother.

72
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,760
Mother always did[br]like Richard best.

73
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:31,230
Your Highness, please don't do that,[br]if you don't mind my saying so.

74
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:34,190
You see,[br]you have a very loud thumb.

75
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:40,030
Hypnotism can rid you[br]of your psychosis-sis...

76
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,500
so...

77
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:46,170
easily.

78
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,470
No! None of that![br]None of that.

79
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:51,220
Well, I was only[br]trying to help.

80
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:56,040
- I wonder. Silly serpent.[br]- "Silly serpent"?

81
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:59,580
Now, look here. One more...[br]One more hiss out of you...

82
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:05,350
Hiss... And you are walking[br]to Nottingham.

83
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,650
Snakes don't walk.[br]They slither.

84
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,430
Hmph. So there.

85
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,830
Now, what about that for luck?[br]It's only a circus.

86
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,830
A peanut operation.

87
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,120
Peanuts? Why, you dunce,[br]that's the royal coach.

88
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:55,220
- It's Prince John himself.[br]- The prince?

89
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,540
Wait a minute.[br]There's a law against robbin' royalty.

90
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,960
- I'll catch ya later.[br]- What?

91
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:02,810
And miss this chance[br]to perform before royalty?

92
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,440
Here we go again.

93
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:13,190
Oo-de-lally! Oo-de-lally![br]Fortune-tellers!

94
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:16,060
Fortunes forecast.[br]Lucky charms.

95
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:19,580
Get the dope[br]with your horoscope.

96
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,860
Fortune-tellers![br]How droll. Uh... Stop the coach.

97
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:26,820
- Sire. Sire. They may be bandits.[br]- Oh, poppycock.

98
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:30,830
Female bandits? What next?[br]Rubbish.

99
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:35,880
My dear ladies,[br]uh, you have my permission...

100
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:40,420
to kiss the royal hands,[br]whichever you like first.

101
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:43,080
Mmm! Oh!

102
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:46,710
How gracious and generous.

103
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,440
Sire. Sire.[br]Did you see what they...

104
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,890
Stop. Stop hissing in my ear.

105
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:00,100
Did ya see? Did ya see?

106
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:04,910
Hiss! Oh, you've[br]hissed your last hiss.

107
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:12,190
Suspicious snake.

108
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:16,440
Masterfully done,[br]Your Excellency.

109
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:19,300
Now close your eyes[br]and concentrate.

110
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,990
Close your eyes. Tight. Shut.[br]No peeking, sire.

111
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,410
From the mists of time...

112
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:31,130
come forth, spirits.

113
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:32,950
Yoo-hoo!

114
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:37,060
Okay, little fireflies.[br]Glow, babies. Glow.

115
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:40,810
We're waiting. Ah... Oh!

116
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:44,890
Look, sire. Look!

117
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,190
Ah! Incredible.

118
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:49,180
Floating spirits.

119
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,980
Naughty, naughty.[br]You mustn't touch, young man.

120
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:57,030
Oh, how dare you strike[br]the royal hand...

121
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:00,980
Shh. Shh. You'll break the spell.[br]Just gaze into the crystal ball.

122
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:04,740
Oo-de-lally. Oo-de-lall...

123
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:08,250
Oh! A face appears.

124
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,950
A crown is[br]on his noble brow.

125
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,660
Oo-de-lally.[br]A crown! How exciting!

126
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,930
His face is handsome...

127
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:26,600
regal, majestic, lovable.

128
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,010
A cuddly face.

129
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,010
"Handsome, regal...

130
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,560
majestic, lovable."

131
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,880
Yes, yes. "Cuddly."

132
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,820
Oh, that's me to a "T."[br]It really is, yes.

133
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,190
Now what?

134
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:52,370
I, uh... I see, um...[br]your illustrious name.

135
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,950
I know my name![br]Get on with it!

136
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,630
Your name will go down, down...

137
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:01,280
down in history, of course.

138
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:05,530
Yes! I knew it! I knew it![br]Do you hear that, Hiss?

139
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:08,970
Oh, you can't...[br]He's in the basket.

140
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:11,460
Do-Don't forget it.

141
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,880
Hmm. What have we here?

142
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:19,640
Solid gold hubcaps.

143
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:32,850
Oo-de-lally. The jackpot.

144
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,270
Robbed! I've been robbed!

145
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,900
Hiss! You're never around[br]when I need you.

146
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:21,860
- I've been robbed.[br]- Of course, you've been robbed!

147
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,020
Oo-de-lally! Oo-de-lally!

148
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:26,610
Fortunes forecast. Lucky charms.

149
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,250
After them, you fools!

150
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:46,420
No, no, no, no!

151
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:50,040
I knew it. I knew it.[br]I just knew this would happen.

152
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:52,040
I tried to warn you,[br]but, no, no, no, you wouldn't listen.

153
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,290
You just had to... Ah! Ah! Ah!

154
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:59,930
Seven years bad... Ooh! Luck.[br]That's what it is.

155
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,970
Besides, you broke[br]your mother's mirror.

156
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:06,220
Mommy.

157
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:09,600
I've got a dirty thumb.

158
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,360
Well, even though Prince John[br]offered a huge reward...

159
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:21,160
for the capture of Robin Hood...

160
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:25,370
that elusive rogue kept right on[br]robbing the rich to feed the poor.

161
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:27,540
And believe me,[br]it's a good thing he did...

162
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:29,540
because what with taxes and all...

163
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:33,870
the poor folks of Nottingham[br]were starvin' to death.

164
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:37,220
Uh-oh. Here comes[br]Old Bad News himself...

165
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,550
the Honourable Sheriff of Nottingham.

166
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:45,850
Every town[br]Has the taxes too

167
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:51,010
And the taxes is due[br]Do- do-do-do-do

168
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:56,340
Well, looky there.[br]Friar Tuck, the old do-gooder.

169
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,360
He's out doin' good again.

170
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:05,200
Well, good mornin', Friar Tuck.

171
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:09,520
Shh, Otto, shh.[br]For you, Otto, from Robin Hood.

172
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:12,550
Oh, God bless Robin Hood.

173
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,010
It's the sheriff.[br]Hurry. Hide it quick.

174
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:25,760
Here I come, ready or not.

175
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:32,140
Well, greetings from your friendly[br]neighbourhood tax collector.

176
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:34,850
Oh, take it easy on me, Sheriff.

177
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:37,390
Wha-Wha-What with this busted leg[br]and all, you know...

178
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,050
l-I'm way behind[br]in me work, Sheriff.

179
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:44,730
I know, Otto, but you're way behind[br]with your taxes too.

180
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,400
Oh, have a heart, Sheriff.

181
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:50,060
Can't ya see he's laid up?

182
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,100
Come on, Otto.[br]You'd better sit down and rest.

183
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,870
Oh, thank you. Yes.

184
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:02,630
Let me give you[br]a hand with that leg.

185
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:07,500
Upsy-daisy. Bingo.

186
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:10,250
Oh, what they won't[br]think of next.

187
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:19,130
It smarts, don't it, Otto? But[br]Prince John says that taxes should hurt.

188
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:23,140
Now, see here,[br]you-you evil, flint-hearted...

189
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:27,090
Now, now, now, now,[br]save your sermon, preacher.

190
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,600
It ain't Sunday, ya know.

191
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:36,030
They call me a slob[br]But I do my job

192
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:41,740
Happy birthday to you

193
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:45,910
Happy birthday to you

194
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,320
Happy birthday, dear Skippy

195
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:57,320
Happy birthday to you

196
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:01,350
Well, now, sonny, that box[br]is done up right pretty, ain't it?

197
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:06,340
Well, Mr Sheriff, sir,[br]it's my birthday present, sir.

198
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:09,300
It sure is.[br]Why don't ya open it?

199
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:14,220
Oh, boy! One whole farthing!

200
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:21,560
Have you no heart? We all scrimped[br]and saved to give it to him.

201
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:25,570
Now, that's mighty "thoughty" of ya,[br]"widder" woman.

202
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:30,560
The family that saves together,[br]pays together.

203
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:33,330
Oh, now don't take it[br]so hard, sonny.

204
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:36,580
Prince John wishes you[br]a happy birthday too.

205
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:41,660
Alms. Alms.[br]Alms for the poor.

206
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,500
Hmm. Well.

207
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:52,330
Well, so far it's been[br]a cheerful morning.

208
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:56,550
- Keep savin'.[br]- What a dirty trick.

209
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,350
You poor old man.

210
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:03,270
Do come in.[br]Come in and rest yourself.

211
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,360
Thank ye kindly, Mother.[br]Thank ye.

212
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:12,360
Tell me now. Did me old ears hear[br]someone singin' a birthday ditty?

213
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,720
Yes, sir.

214
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,530
And that mean, old sheriff...

215
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:18,610
took my birthday present.

216
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,860
Did he now?

217
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:25,610
But be a stouthearted little lad,[br]and don't let it get ya down.

218
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,080
Gee whiz![br]It's Robin Hood!

219
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,740
Happy birthday, son.

220
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:36,050
Oh, he's so handsome,[br]just like his reward posters.

221
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:39,300
Tell me, young man,[br]how old are you today?

222
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,960
Gosh. I'm seven years old,[br]goin' on eight.

223
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:46,340
Seven? Well, that does make you[br]the man of the house.

224
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:48,980
And I've got[br]just the right present for you.

225
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:51,390
For me?

226
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,480
Gee, thanks,[br]Mr Robin Hood, sir.

227
00:19:55,560 --> 00:20:00,390
- Hey, how do I look, huh?[br]- Not much like Mr Robin Hood.

228
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,190
She's right.[br]There is something missing.

229
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:07,120
Of course! There you go.

230
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,400
Boy, oh, boy![br]Now how do I look?

231
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:16,120
- The hat's too big.[br]- Shh! Mind your manners.

232
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,410
Yes. Mind your manners.

233
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:22,700
Don't worry.[br]You'll grow into it, young man.

234
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,370
Oo-de-lally![br]I'm gonna try it out.

235
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:30,090
Goodbye, Mr Robin Hood.[br]Come again on my birthday.

236
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:35,590
Oh, you have made his birthday[br]a wonderful one.

237
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:37,840
How can I ever thank ya?

238
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:41,600
I only wish I could do more.[br]Here.

239
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,590
Now keep your chin up.

240
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:47,600
Someday, there'll be happiness[br]again in Nottingham. You'll see.

241
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:52,940
Oh, Robin Hood, you've risked so much[br]to keep our hopes alive.

242
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:56,480
Bless you. Bless you.

243
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,410
Gee. Did Robin Hood[br]really give it to you?

244
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:13,870
Yeah. And this is[br]his own hat too.

245
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:16,410
Gee. I'd sure like[br]to shoot your bow and arrow.

246
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,740
- Let me try it, Skippy.[br]- Oh, no, you don't.

247
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:22,340
- I'm gonna shoot it first.[br]- You're pointin' it too high.

248
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,830
I'm not either. Watch this.

249
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,660
Uh-oh. Now ya done it.

250
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,250
Right in Prince John's backyard.

251
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:46,760
Skippy, you can't[br]go in there.

252
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:49,720
Yeah. Prince John'll[br]chop off your head.

253
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:53,320
Like this.

254
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:55,480
Oh, I don't care.[br]I gotta get my arrow.

255
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:58,110
Wait a minute.[br]Toby might tattle on ya.

256
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,240
- Yeah, Toby. You gotta take the oath.[br]- An oath?

257
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:05,330
Put your hand on your heart[br]and cross your eyes.

258
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,490
Spider, snakes[br]and a lizard head.

259
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:12,250
"Spiders, snakes[br]and a lizard's head."

260
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:15,170
If I tattletale,[br]I'll die till I'm dead.

261
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:19,460
"If I tattletale,[br]I'll die till I'm dead."

262
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:34,010
Why, it's your turn[br]to serve, Marian, dear.

263
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,340
Are you ready, Lady Kluck?

264
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,730
Oh, as your lady-in-waiting,[br]I'm waiting.

265
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,570
I'm getting too old for this. Oh.

266
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:54,700
- Klucky, that was a good shot.[br]- Oh! Not bad yourself, dear.

267
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,700
Oh, my girdle's killing me.

268
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:07,920
- Where is it? Did you lose it?[br]- Well, it must be in there someplace.

269
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,630
Oh, Klucky, you look so silly.

270
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,560
Oh, look. There it is behind you.

271
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:19,140
Oh! Well, hello.[br]Where did you come from?

272
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:22,230
Oh, please,[br]don't tell Prince John.

273
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:24,730
Mama said he'll chop off my head.

274
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,310
Oh, don't be afraid.[br]You've done nothing wrong.

275
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,490
Oh, Marian.[br]What a bonny, wee bunny.

276
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:33,740
Now, who does this young archer[br]remind you of?

277
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:39,060
Oh. Well, upon my word,[br]the notorious Robin Hood.

278
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:43,570
That's right! Why, only[br]Robin Hood wears a hat like that.

279
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:46,160
Yeah, and look at[br]this keen Robin Hood bow.

280
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:56,090
Oh, Marian. Don't look around,[br]but I do believe we're surrounded.

281
00:23:56,180 --> 00:24:00,250
- Oh, mercy.[br]- He snitched on us.

282
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:03,380
It's all right, children.[br]Don't be afraid.

283
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:06,640
- Please come here.[br]- Do you think it's safe?

284
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:12,100
- That's Maid Marian.[br]- Mama said she's awful nice. Come on!

285
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:17,930
He-Hey, you guys, not so fast.[br]Wait for me.

286
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:20,270
I told Skippy[br]he was shooting too high.

287
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:25,780
I'm so very glad he did.[br]And now I get to meet all of you.

288
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:29,780
- Gee. You're very beautiful.[br]- Are you gonna marry Robin Hood?

289
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:35,110
Mama said you and Robin Hood[br]are sweethearts.

290
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:40,630
Well, um, you see, that was several[br]years ago, before I left for London.

291
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:45,960
- Did he ever kiss ya?[br]- Well, uh, no.

292
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:48,800
But he carved our initials[br]on this tree.

293
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:54,470
- I remember it so well.[br]- You gonna have any kids?

294
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:56,790
My mama gots a lot of kids.

295
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:59,650
Oh, he's probably[br]forgotten all about me.

296
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:01,970
Oh, not Robin Hood.

297
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:05,650
I bet he'll storm the castle gates,[br]fight the guards...

298
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:08,480
rescue ya and drag ya[br]out to Sherwood Forest.

299
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:12,980
Now, just a moment there,[br]young man.

300
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,290
You've forgotten Prince John.

301
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:18,650
That old Prince John[br]don't scare me none.

302
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:22,500
I'm scared of Prince John.[br]He's cranky.

303
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:29,500
I, Prince John,[br]challenge you to a duel.

304
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:32,840
Take that. And that. And this.

305
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:37,180
Death to tyrants!

306
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,880
Slice him to pieces!

307
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:46,010
Oh, save me, my hero.[br]Save me.

308
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,140
Oh! Ouch![br]That's not fair.

309
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:51,690
Mommy!

310
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:55,970
That's Prince John, all right!

311
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:02,370
- Ya-hoo! Now I gotcha![br]- Oh! Mercy! Mercy!

312
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,450
He got me. I'm dying.

313
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:11,150
- Ohh![br]- Did I hurt ya? Huh?

314
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:16,080
Now, this is the part where you drag[br]your lady fair off to Sherwood Forest.

315
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,550
Come on, lady fair. Let's go!

316
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:25,410
Oh, Robin,[br]you're so brave and impetuous.

317
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:31,180
Oh. So this is Sherwood Forest.

318
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:35,480
Yeah, I guess so.[br]Well, now what are we gonna do?

319
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:39,720
Well, usually, the hero[br]gives his fair lady a kiss.

320
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:43,230
A kiss? Oh, that's sissy stuff.

321
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:46,940
Well, if you won't, then I will.

322
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:50,730
They're kissing.

323
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:25,690
Ah, me. Young love.

324
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:28,090
Oh, it's a grand thing.

325
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:33,190
Oh, Klucky, surely he must know[br]how much I still love him.

326
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:36,200
But, of course, my dear.

327
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,450
Believe me, someday soon...

328
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:43,610
your uncle, King Richard,[br]will have an outlaw for an in-law.

329
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:49,960
Oh, Klucky! But when? When?

330
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,580
Oh, patience, my dear. Patience.

331
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:56,660
Remember, absence[br]makes the heart grow fonder.

332
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,210
Or forgetful.

333
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,890
Oh, I've been away so long.

334
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:05,550
What if he's forgotten[br]all about me?

335
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:22,140
Hey, lover boy. How's that grub[br]comin', man? I'm starved.

336
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:28,480
Rob? Robin.

337
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,480
Robaire.

338
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:35,200
- Hey![br]- Hmm? What? What do you say?

339
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:38,160
Ah, forget it.[br]Your mind's not on food.

340
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:41,780
You're thinking about somebody[br]with long eyelashes...

341
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,450
and you're smellin'[br]that sweet perfume.

342
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:51,790
- Hey! Whoa! L-It's boiling over.[br]- You're burnin' the chow!

343
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:58,140
Sorry, Johnny. I guess I was[br]thinking about Maid Marian again.

344
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:02,630
I can't help it.[br]I love her, Johnny.

345
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,070
Look, why don't ya stop[br]moanin' and mopin' around?

346
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:09,770
- Just-Just marry the girl.[br]- Marry her?

347
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:13,110
You don't just walk up to a girl,[br]hand her a bouquet and say...

348
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:15,980
"Hey, remember me? We were kids[br]together. Will you marry me?"

349
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:19,490
No, it just isn't done that way.

350
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:22,950
Ah, come on, Robby.[br]Climb the castle walls.

351
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:28,500
Sweep her off her feet.[br]Carry her off in style.

352
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:33,210
It's no use, Johnny. I've thought it[br]all out, and it just wouldn't work.

353
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:37,840
- Besides, what have I got to offer her?[br]- Well, for one thing, you can't cook.

354
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:41,510
I'm serious, Johnny.[br]She's a highborn lady of quality.

355
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:46,960
- So she's got class. So what?[br]- I'm an outlaw. That's what.

356
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:50,170
That's no life for a lovely lady.[br]Always on the run.

357
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:55,010
- What kind of a future is that?[br]- Oh, for heaven's sake, son.

358
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:57,350
You're no outlaw.

359
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,280
Why, someday,[br]you'll be called a great hero.

360
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,190
A hero? Did you hear that, Johnny?[br]We've just been pardoned.

361
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:09,070
That's a gas.[br]We ain't even been arrested yet.

362
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:12,190
All right, laugh,[br]you two rogues...

363
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:15,490
but there's gonna be[br]a big to-do in Nottingham.

364
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:20,370
Well-done, ain't it?

365
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:26,050
Old Prince John's havin' a championship[br]archery tournament tomorrow.

366
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:27,870
Archery tournament?

367
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:31,250
Old Rob could win that[br]standin' on his head, huh, Rob?

368
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:35,970
Thank you, Little John,[br]but I'm sure we're not invited.

369
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:41,560
No, but there's somebody who'll be[br]very disappointed if you don't come.

370
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:46,800
Yeah. Old Bushel Britches,[br]the Honourable Sheriff of Nottingham.

371
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:50,070
No. Maid Marian.

372
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:53,080
- Maid Marian?[br]- Yeah.

373
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:56,330
She-She's gonna give a kiss[br]to the winner.

374
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:58,820
Kiss to the winner!

375
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:02,780
Oo-de-lally. Come on, Johnny.[br]What are we waiting for?

376
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:07,760
Wait a minute, Rob. Hold it. That place[br]will be crawlin' with soldiers.

377
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,510
Aha. But remember...

378
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:15,420
faint hearts[br]never won fair lady.

379
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:18,460
Fear not, my friends.

380
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:21,920
This will be[br]my greatest performance.

381
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:56,450
Hiss, this is a red-letter day.

382
00:31:56,550 --> 00:32:00,700
A coup d'etat,[br]to coin a Norman phrase.

383
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,460
Ooh. Oh, yes, indeed, sire.

384
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:07,500
Your plan to capture Robin Hood[br]in public is sheer genius.

385
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,590
Hiss, no one sits higher[br]than the king.

386
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,600
Must I remind you, Hiss?

387
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:20,310
Do... Do forgive me, sire.[br]I didn't mean to...

388
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:23,140
My trap is baited and set.

389
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:28,230
And then revenge![br]Ah! Revenge!

390
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:33,030
Shh. Not so loud, sire.[br]Remember, only you and I know.

391
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,900
And your s-secret is my s-secret.

392
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:38,820
Stop. Stop hissing in my ear.

393
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:41,130
Secret? What secret?

394
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:44,290
Why, the capture[br]of Robin Hood, sire.

395
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:47,040
That insolent blackguard.

396
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:51,080
Ooh! I'll show him[br]who wears the crown!

397
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:53,870
I share your loathing, sire.

398
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,560
That scurrilous scoundrel who fooled you[br]with that silly disguise...

399
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,810
who dared to rob you[br]and make you look so utterly ridiculous.

400
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:03,590
Enough!

401
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,770
Hiss, you deliberately dodged.

402
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:10,350
But-But-But, sire, please...

403
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:14,650
Stop snivelling and hold still.

404
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:19,520
Thank you, sire.

405
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:22,190
Oh, Klucky, I'm so excited.

406
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,350
But how will I recognize him?

407
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:27,160
Oh, he'll let you know somehow.

408
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:32,380
That young rogue of yours[br]is full of surprises, my dear.

409
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:36,450
There she is, Little John.[br]Isn't she beautiful?

410
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:40,950
Cool it, lover boy. Your heart's[br]runnin' away with your head.

411
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:44,720
Ah, stop worrying.[br]This disguise would fool my own mother.

412
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:50,670
Yeah. But your mom ain't here.[br]You gotta fool Old Bushel Britches.

413
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,930
- Sheriff, Your Honour?[br]- Yeah.

414
00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:02,220
Meetin' ya face-to-face[br]is a real treat. A real treat.

415
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,730
Well, now, thank you.

416
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:07,600
Oh... Excuse me. I gotta go[br]win this tournament.

417
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:10,900
Hey, old Rob's not a bad actor.

418
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:15,150
But wait'll he sees this scene[br]I lay on Prince John.

419
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:21,070
Ah! Me lord.

420
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:24,700
My esteemed royal sovereign[br]of the realm.

421
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:27,740
The head man himself.

422
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:30,140
You're beautiful.

423
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,050
He has style, hey, Hiss?

424
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:42,510
Ya took the words[br]right outta my mouth, P.J.

425
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,640
P.J. I like that.[br]Do you know, I do.

426
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:48,980
Hiss, put it on my luggage. P.J.

427
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:53,280
P.J. Yes.

428
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:58,890
And you?[br]Who might you be, sir?

429
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:02,940
I am Sir Reginald,[br]Duke of Chutney.

430
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,820
And don't stick[br]your tongue out at me, kid.

431
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:11,400
And now, Your Mightiness,[br]allow me to lay some protocol on you.

432
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:15,830
Oh, no. Forgive me,[br]but I lose more jewels that way than...

433
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:20,000
- Please sit down.[br]- Thanks, P.J.

434
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:22,670
Couldn't get a better seat[br]than this, could ya? The royal box.

435
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,680
Oh! Hey! Hey, what the...

436
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,170
Oh, uh, excuse me, buster.

437
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:32,480
"Buster"? You, sir,[br]have taken my seat.

438
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:38,800
Hiss, with you around,[br]who needs a court jester?

439
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:49,540
Now get out there and keep[br]your snake eyes open for you know who.

440
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:54,190
You... You-You mean, l...[br]I'm being dismissed?

441
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:57,730
You heard His Mightiness.[br]Move it, creepy. Get lost.

442
00:35:57,830 --> 00:36:00,920
Be gone, long one.

443
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:04,200
What cheek! "Creepy.

444
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:07,470
Buster. Long one."

445
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:10,330
Who does that dopey duke[br]think he is?

446
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:14,470
- Now, he's up to somethin', Friar.[br]- Yeah. Come on.

447
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:14,130
Ah, Your Ladyship.

448
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:16,630
Beggin' your pardon,[br]but it's a great honour...

449
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:20,570
to be shootin' for the favour[br]of a lovely lady like yourself.

450
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:24,600
- I hopes I win the kiss.[br]- Oh!

451
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:32,150
Well, thank you,[br]my thin-legged archer.

452
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:36,490
I wish you luck[br]with all my heart.

453
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:39,530
Hmm. I wonder.

454
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:48,660
Your Highness, with your royal[br]permission, we are ready to begin.

455
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:51,340
Proceed, Captain.

456
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:55,890
The Tournament of the Golden Arrow[br]will now begin.

457
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,570
Yea, Dad.

458
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:32,590
Boo!

459
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:45,300
A perfect bullseye.[br]Well, well.

460
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:49,430
Yeah. That's what ya call[br]pullin' it back and lettin' it go, P.J.

461
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,650
I'm gonna win[br]that golden arrow...

462
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:54,220
and then I'm gonna present meself[br]to the lovely Maid Marian...

463
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:59,060
Listen, scissor bill, if you shoot[br]half as good as you blabber-mouth...

464
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:00,560
you're better than Robin Hood.

465
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:03,990
"Robin Hood," he says. Wowee!

466
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:08,070
I'm tip-top, all right,[br]but I'm not as good as he is.

467
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:18,540
That kid's got class,[br]ain't he, P.J.?

468
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:22,220
Indeed he has, Reggie.

469
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:26,590
Bravo! Bravo! Yes.

470
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:29,600
Oh, um, by the way...

471
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:34,960
I hear you're having a bit of trouble[br]gettin' your hands on that Robin Hood.

472
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:39,220
He's scared of me. That's what he is.[br]You notice he didn't show up here today.

473
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:43,220
Heh! I could spot him[br]through them phoney disguises.

474
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,470
It's him! It's Robin Hood!

475
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:50,230
I just can't wait[br]till I tell His Majesty.

476
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:02,750
Unhand me, you...

477
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:05,280
Please. Please. I don't drink.

478
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:10,750
Attention, everyone.

479
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,620
The final contestants are:

480
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:17,250
The Honourable Sheriff of Nottingham.

481
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:26,260
And the spindle-legged stork[br]from Devonshire.

482
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:34,800
My dear, I suspect you favour[br]the gangly youth, hmm?

483
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:38,560
Uh... Why, yes, sire.

484
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:41,910
Well, at least he amuses me.

485
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:44,400
Coincidentally, my dear young lady...

486
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:48,650
he amuses me too.

487
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:51,580
For the final shoot-out...

488
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:55,290
move the target back 30 paces.

489
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:59,370
You heard him, Nutsy. Get goin'.[br]Move it, you birdbrain.

490
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:03,620
And remember[br]what you're supposed to do.

491
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,620
Yes, sir, Sheriff, sir.

492
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,760
Well, that shot[br]wins the golden arrow...

493
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:20,300
the kiss[br]and the whole caboodle.

494
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:37,480
Yea! He did it![br]He did it! He did it!

495
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:05,040
Archer, I commend you.

496
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:10,800
And because of your superior skill[br]you shall get what is coming to you.

497
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:15,220
Our royal congratulations.

498
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:17,840
Oh, thank you kindly,[br]Your Highness.

499
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:22,930
Meetin' you face-to-face,[br]Your High and Mighty, is a real treat.

500
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:26,470
Release the royal fingers. Ah!

501
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:31,480
And now, I name you the winner.

502
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:33,980
Or more appropriately...

503
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:37,020
the loser.

504
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:42,370
Seize him.

505
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:48,910
I sentence you to sudden...

506
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:53,830
instant and even immediate death.

507
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,250
Oh, no! Oh!

508
00:42:57,340 --> 00:43:00,920
Please. Please, sire.

509
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:05,590
I beg of you to spare his life.[br]Please, have mercy.

510
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:08,840
My dear, emotional lady,[br]why should I?

511
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:13,270
- Because I love him, Your Highness.[br]- Love him?

512
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:17,230
And does this prisoner[br]return your love?

513
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:24,270
Marian, my darling,[br]I love you more than life itself.

514
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:27,770
Ah. Young love.

515
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:33,660
Your pleas have not fallen[br]upon a heart of stone.

516
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:36,790
But traitors to the crown[br]must die!

517
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,800
Traitor to the crown?[br]That crown belongs to King Richard.

518
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:43,540
- Long live King Richard![br]- Long live King Richard!

519
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:46,170
Enough! I am king!

520
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:48,210
King! King!

521
00:43:48,310 --> 00:43:51,840
Ah! Off with his head!

522
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:06,770
Oh, no.

523
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:13,440
Stop! Executioners, stop![br]Hold your axe!

524
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:17,490
Okay, big shot. Now tell 'em[br]to untie my buddy, or I'll...

525
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:19,950
Sheriff, release my buddy.

526
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:23,490
I mean, release the prisoner!

527
00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:26,250
Untie the prisoner?

528
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:28,910
You heard what he said,[br]Bushel Britches!

529
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,630
Sheriff, I make the rules.

530
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:34,670
And since I am the head man...

531
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:37,920
Not so hard, you mean thing.

532
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:41,590
Let him go, for heaven sakes![br]Let him go!

533
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:45,420
Yee-hee![br]Love conquers all!

534
00:44:50,570 --> 00:44:52,640
I owe my life to you,[br]my darling.

535
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:55,180
I couldn't have lived[br]without you, Robin.

536
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:59,240
There's somethin' funny[br]goin' on around here.

537
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:02,360
Now, P.J., tell my pal[br]to kiss Maid Marian...

538
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:04,490
or I've just found[br]a new pincushion.

539
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:05,820
Why, you...

540
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:11,240
Kill him! Don't stand there![br]Kill him!

541
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:30,130
Don't hurt me. No! No! Don't hurt me![br]Help! Help!

542
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:37,140
Kill him!

543
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:41,310
Run for it, lassie![br]This is no place for a lady!

544
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:48,530
Take that, you scoundrel!

545
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,820
Help! Robin, help!

546
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:57,250
Marian, my love,[br]will you marry me?

547
00:45:57,330 --> 00:45:59,950
Oh, darling, I thought[br]you'd never ask me.

548
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:06,000
Oh, but you could have chose[br]a more romantic setting.

549
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:08,420
- And for our honeymoon, London![br]- Yes!

550
00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:10,000
- Normandy![br]- Yes!

551
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:12,000
- Sunny Spain![br]- Why not?

552
00:46:14,590 --> 00:46:17,510
Ooh, what a main event this is.

553
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:21,180
Yippee! Ya-hoo! Yippee!

554
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:23,180
What a beautiful brawl.

555
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:34,980
Hey! Who's driving[br]this flying umbrella?

556
00:46:42,370 --> 00:46:45,120
- We'll have six children.[br]- Six?

557
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,240
Oh, a dozen, at least.

558
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:53,620
Take that!

559
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:59,880
Attention, everyone...

560
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,110
Stop the girl!

561
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:39,450
Take that, you scurvy knave!

562
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:41,450
Seize the fat one!

563
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:21,690
Long live King Richard![br]Ya-hoo!

564
00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:27,540
Hiss! You're never around[br]when I need you.

565
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:30,160
Coming. Coming.

566
00:48:31,550 --> 00:48:35,370
For I'm a jolly good fellow[br]For I'm a jolly good fellow

567
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:41,060
Oh! Oh, there you are, old boy.

568
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:45,960
P.J., you won't believe this,[br]but the stork is really Robin Hood.

569
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:48,050
Robin Hood.

570
00:48:54,570 --> 00:48:56,980
Get out of that, if you can.

571
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:14,260
Love, it seems like only yesterday

572
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:20,110
You werejust a child at play

573
00:49:22,190 --> 00:49:27,910
Now you're all grown up[br]inside of me

574
00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:32,120
Oh, how fast those moments flee

575
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:38,540
Once we watched a lazy world go by

576
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:44,050
Now the days seem to fly

577
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:51,670
Life is brief[br]But when it's gone

578
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:55,690
Love goes on and on

579
00:50:02,350 --> 00:50:05,690
Love will live

580
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:11,490
Love will last

581
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:21,950
Love goes on and on and on

582
00:50:22,030 --> 00:50:26,550
Once we watched a lazy world go by

583
00:50:28,170 --> 00:50:31,790
Now the days seem to fly

584
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:39,660
Life is brief[br]But when it's gone

585
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:44,730
Love goes on and on

586
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:52,590
Oh, Robin,[br]what a beautiful night.

587
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:55,440
I wish it would never end.

588
00:50:55,520 --> 00:51:00,200
Surprise![br]Long live Robin Hood!

589
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:01,990
Hooray! Hooray!

590
00:51:02,070 --> 00:51:04,200
And long live Maid Marian!

591
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:06,280
Bravo! Bravo!

592
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,910
Hear, hear![br]Bravo! Bravo! Hooray!

593
00:51:10,490 --> 00:51:14,250
And down with[br]that scurvy Prince John.

594
00:51:14,330 --> 00:51:15,500
Yeah.

595
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:19,420
Oh, the world will sing[br]of an English king

596
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,590
A thousand years from now

597
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:26,170
And not because he passed some laws[br]or had that lofty brow

598
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:30,260
While bonny good King Richard[br]leads the great crusade he's on

599
00:51:30,350 --> 00:51:34,810
We'll all have to slave away[br]for that good-for-nothin'John

600
00:51:34,890 --> 00:51:39,270
Incredible as he is inept[br]whenever the history books are kept

601
00:51:39,350 --> 00:51:43,570
They'll call him[br]the phoney King of England

602
00:51:43,650 --> 00:51:47,350
A pox on the phoney King of England

603
00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:05,080
He sits alone on a giant throne[br]pretendin'he's the king

604
00:52:05,170 --> 00:52:09,210
A little tyke who's rather like[br]a puppet on a string

605
00:52:09,290 --> 00:52:13,550
And he throws an angry tantrum[br]if he cannot have his way

606
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:18,760
And then he calls for Mom[br]while he's suckin' his thumb.

607
00:52:18,850 --> 00:52:22,300
You see, he doesn't want to play.

608
00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:26,720
Too late to be known as John the First[br]He's sure to known as John the Worst

609
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:30,730
A pox on that phoney King of England

610
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:33,360
Lay that country on me, babe.

611
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:39,740
Come on, Johnny!

612
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:42,780
Go, man, go!

613
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:09,850
While he taxes us to pieces[br]and he robs us of our bread

614
00:53:09,930 --> 00:53:14,180
King Richard's crown keeps slippin'down[br]around that pointed head, ah

615
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:18,650
But while there is a merry man[br]in Robin's wily pack

616
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:22,940
We'll find a way to make him pay[br]and steal our money back

617
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:25,430
A minute before he knows we're there

618
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:28,610
Old Rob'll snatch his underwear.

619
00:53:32,950 --> 00:53:37,200
The breezy and uneasy King of England

620
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:39,370
The snivellin', grovellin'

621
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:41,540
Measly, weaselly

622
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:43,710
Blabberin', jabberin'

623
00:53:43,790 --> 00:53:45,830
Jibberin', jabberin'

624
00:53:45,910 --> 00:53:48,050
Plunderin', plottin'

625
00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:50,220
Wheelin', dealin'

626
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:55,720
PrinceJohn[br]That phoney King of England, yeah

627
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:07,560
He throws an angry tantrum[br]if he cannot have his way

628
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:11,860
He calls for Mom and sucks his thumb[br]and doesn't want to play

629
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:14,060
Too late to be known as John the First

630
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:17,910
He's sure to be known[br]as John the Worst

631
00:54:17,990 --> 00:54:20,950
How about that?

632
00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:24,730
That's P.J. To a "T."[br]Let me try. Let me try.

633
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:34,760
Too late to be known as John the First[br]He's sure to be known as John the Worst

634
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:40,170
The fabulous, marvellous,[br]merciful, ch-ch-chivalrous...

635
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:42,010
Oh, ya got it all wrong, Hiss.

636
00:54:42,090 --> 00:54:44,500
The snivellin', grovellin', weaselly...

637
00:54:44,590 --> 00:54:47,940
Enough!

638
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:53,230
But-But, uh, sire, it's a big hit.[br]The whole village is singin' it.

639
00:54:53,310 --> 00:54:56,310
Oh, they are, are they?

640
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:00,340
Well, they'll be[br]singing a different tune.

641
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:04,310
Double the taxes.[br]Triple the taxes.

642
00:55:04,410 --> 00:55:06,980
Squeeze every last drop...

643
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:10,940
out of those insolent,[br]musical peasants.

644
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:21,860
Man, oh, man. That Prince John[br]sure made good his threat.

645
00:55:23,790 --> 00:55:28,940
And his helpless subjects paid dearly[br]for his humiliation, believe me.

646
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:34,090
Taxes, taxes, taxes.

647
00:55:34,170 --> 00:55:37,700
Why, he taxed the heart and soul[br]out of the poor people of Nottingham.

648
00:55:39,550 --> 00:55:43,590
And if you couldn't pay your taxes,[br]you went to jail.

649
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:50,230
Yep. I'm in here too.[br]Nottingham was in deep trouble.

650
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:55,930
Every town

651
00:55:58,270 --> 00:56:01,020
Has its ups and downs

652
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,910
Sometimes ups

653
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,330
Outnumber the downs

654
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:16,700
But not in Nottingham

655
00:56:18,990 --> 00:56:22,090
I'm inclined to believe

656
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:27,330
If we weren't so down

657
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:32,170
We'd up and leave

658
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:37,730
We'd up and fly

659
00:56:37,810 --> 00:56:42,550
If we had wings for flyin'

660
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:47,130
Can't ya see the tears we're cryin'

661
00:56:47,230 --> 00:56:53,100
Can't there be some happiness for me

662
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:58,320
Not in Nottingham

663
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:48,320
Friar Tuck.

664
00:57:49,450 --> 00:57:51,520
I don't think anyone[br]is coming.

665
00:57:51,610 --> 00:57:55,540
You're right, Sexton, but maybe[br]the sound of this church bell...

666
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:58,460
will bring those poor people[br]some comfort.

667
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:05,490
We must do what we can[br]to keep their hopes alive.

668
00:58:08,290 --> 00:58:13,350
Oh. How can there be any hope[br]with that tyrant Prince John...

669
00:58:13,430 --> 00:58:16,680
taxing the heart and soul[br]out of the poor people?

670
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:19,560
Yes, those poor people.

671
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:23,680
Look. Our poor box is like our church.

672
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:25,680
Empty.

673
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:37,360
Friar Tuck.[br]We've saved this.

674
00:58:37,450 --> 00:58:41,040
It's not much,[br]but please take it for the poor.

675
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:43,790
Your last farthing?

676
00:58:43,870 --> 00:58:46,280
Ah, little sister.

677
00:58:46,370 --> 00:58:49,540
No one can give more than that.

678
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:51,860
Bless you both.

679
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:56,010
Oh, we were just saving it[br]for a rainy day.

680
00:58:56,090 --> 00:58:58,000
Well, it's rainin' now.

681
00:58:59,590 --> 00:59:02,850
- Things can't get worse.[br]- Howdy, Friar.

682
00:59:02,930 --> 00:59:06,680
Well, it looks like I dropped by[br]just in time.

683
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:09,680
What does that big-bellied bully[br]want here?

684
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:12,400
Father, shh.

685
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:16,180
Hmm. Well, what have we got here?

686
00:59:16,270 --> 00:59:21,350
Now, just a minute, Sheriff.[br]Th-Th-Th-Th-That's the poor box!

687
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:26,870
It sure is, and I'll just take it[br]for poor Prince John.

688
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:28,370
Every little bit helps.

689
00:59:28,450 --> 00:59:32,070
Ooh. You put that back.

690
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:36,030
And His Majesty[br]also blesses you, little sister.

691
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:38,360
You thievin' scoundrel!

692
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:41,970
Now, take it easy, Friar.[br]I'm just doin' my duty.

693
00:59:42,050 --> 00:59:43,630
Collectin' taxes...

694
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:48,790
for that arrogant, greedy,[br]ruthless, no-good Prince John?

695
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:51,800
Listen, Friar.[br]You're mighty preachy...

696
00:59:51,890 --> 00:59:56,180
and you gonna preach your neck[br]right into a hangman's noose.

697
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:58,730
Get outta my church!

698
00:59:58,810 --> 01:00:02,650
- Out! Out! Out! Out![br]- Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

699
01:00:02,730 --> 01:00:04,610
Oh, dear me.

700
01:00:04,690 --> 01:00:07,100
You want taxes?

701
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:11,950
- I'll give you taxes![br]- Ow!

702
01:00:12,030 --> 01:00:14,950
Give it to him! Give it to him![br]Give it to him, Friar!

703
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:26,780
You're under arrest[br]for high treason to the crown.

704
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:29,340
Oh, no.

705
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:31,630
Oh, there, there, Mother.

706
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:37,580
Every town

707
01:00:39,590 --> 01:00:42,590
Has its ups and downs

708
01:00:45,390 --> 01:00:47,350
Sometimes ups

709
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:52,900
Outnumber the downs

710
01:00:54,730 --> 01:00:57,810
But not in Nottingham

711
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:28,620
S-sire, if I may...

712
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:30,350
may venture an opinion...

713
01:01:30,430 --> 01:01:33,680
you're not your usual cheerful,[br]genial self today.

714
01:01:39,270 --> 01:01:41,310
L-l-I know. I know.

715
01:01:41,390 --> 01:01:44,990
You haven't counted[br]your money for days. Hmm?

716
01:01:45,070 --> 01:01:47,650
It always makes you so happy.

717
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:55,190
Sire, taxes are pouring in.

718
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:56,530
The jail is full.

719
01:01:56,620 --> 01:01:58,070
And... Oh!

720
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:01,670
I have good news, sire.[br]Friar Tuck is in jail.

721
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:03,990
Friar Tuck?

722
01:02:04,090 --> 01:02:07,590
It's Robin Hood I want,[br]you idiot!

723
01:02:07,670 --> 01:02:11,840
Oh! I'd give all my gold[br]if I could just get my hands...

724
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:13,340
Uh...

725
01:02:15,130 --> 01:02:17,300
Did you say "Friar Tuck"?

726
01:02:17,390 --> 01:02:20,560
Did I? Oh. Y-Y-Yes, I did.

727
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:24,210
Ah, Hiss! I have it.

728
01:02:24,310 --> 01:02:30,480
I'll use that fat friar[br]as bait to trap Robin Hood.

729
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:34,070
- Another trap?[br]- Yes, yes, you stupid serpent.

730
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:39,230
Friar Tuck will be led to the gallows[br]in the village square, don't you see?

731
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:44,560
B-B-B-But, sire, hang Friar Tuck?[br]A man of the church?

732
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:47,580
Yes, my reluctant reptile.

733
01:02:47,670 --> 01:02:51,330
And when our elusive hero[br]tries to rescue...

734
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:54,920
the corpulent cleric...

735
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,490
my men will be ready.

736
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:21,430
Well, Trigger, everything's[br]rigged up and all set.

737
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:24,430
Yep. It's one of the prettiest[br]scaffolds you ever built, Sheriff.

738
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:30,140
Oh, Sheriff, don't ya reckon we'd[br]oughta give that there trapdoor a test?

739
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:39,140
"Criminently." Now I know why[br]your mama called ya Nutsy.

740
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:42,350
Alms. Alms for the poor.

741
01:03:42,450 --> 01:03:48,320
Do me old ears hear[br]the melodious voice of the sheriff?

742
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:50,960
That's right, old man.

743
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:54,000
What be goin' on here?

744
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:56,210
We're gonna hang Friar Tuck.

745
01:03:56,290 --> 01:04:00,380
No! Hang Fri...[br]Um, hang Friar Tuck?

746
01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:02,670
You betcha. At dawn.

747
01:04:02,750 --> 01:04:06,010
And maybe it'll[br]even be a double hangin'.

748
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:08,670
Shh! Shh![br]Dummy up, you dummy.

749
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:12,630
A double hangin', eh?

750
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:15,640
Who be the other one[br]who gets the rope?

751
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:19,180
Sheriff, he's gettin'[br]too all-fired nosy.

752
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:22,070
I didn't mean nothin'.

753
01:04:22,150 --> 01:04:28,100
But, um, couldn't there be trouble[br]if Robin Hood showed up?

754
01:04:28,190 --> 01:04:32,030
Well, what do ya know, Sheriff?[br]He guessed it.

755
01:04:32,110 --> 01:04:34,360
Nutsy, button your beak.

756
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:36,360
Ah, no need to worry.

757
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:40,920
The sheriff be too crafty,[br]too clever and too smart...

758
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,920
for the likes of him, says I.

759
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:49,760
Ya hear that, Nutsy? For bein' blind, he[br]sure knows a good man when he sees one.

760
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:51,800
Heh... Says I.

761
01:04:51,890 --> 01:04:57,040
SHeriff, I still got a feelin' that[br]that snoopy, old codger knows too much.

762
01:04:57,140 --> 01:04:58,640
Oh, shut up, Trigger.

763
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:02,390
He's just a harmless,[br]old, blind beggar.

764
01:05:02,470 --> 01:05:07,140
Alms. Alms for the poor. Alms.

765
01:05:07,230 --> 01:05:09,190
Alms for the poor.

766
01:05:09,270 --> 01:05:13,030
Rob. We can't let 'em[br]hang Friar Tuck.

767
01:05:13,110 --> 01:05:16,140
Ajailbreak tonight[br]is the only chance he's got.

768
01:05:16,230 --> 01:05:19,490
Ajailbreak?[br]There ain't no way you can get...

769
01:05:19,570 --> 01:05:23,000
We've got to, Johnny,[br]or Friar Tuck dies at dawn.

770
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:24,370
One o'clock...

771
01:06:24,470 --> 01:06:28,410
and all's well!

772
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:37,930
Nutsy, you better set your brains[br]ahead a couple of hours.

773
01:06:38,020 --> 01:06:43,260
Yes, sir. Uh, does that there mean[br]addin' or subtractin'?

774
01:06:43,350 --> 01:06:44,930
Oh, let's forget it.

775
01:06:45,020 --> 01:06:47,650
Yes, sir, Sheriff, sir.

776
01:06:47,730 --> 01:06:53,610
Nutsy, how can I sleep with you[br]yellin' "All's well!" all the time here?

777
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:56,620
Sheriff, everything[br]ain't "all's well."

778
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:58,190
I got a feelin' in my bones...

779
01:06:58,280 --> 01:06:59,830
there's gonna be a jailbreak[br]any minute.

780
01:06:59,910 --> 01:07:01,400
"Criminently," Trigger!

781
01:07:01,490 --> 01:07:03,900
Point that peashooter[br]the other way.

782
01:07:03,990 --> 01:07:07,910
Don't you worry none, Sheriff.[br]The safety's on Old Betsy.

783
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:16,210
What in tarnation you tryin' to do,[br]you birdbrain?

784
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:18,040
Just doin' my duty, Sheriff.

785
01:07:18,130 --> 01:07:21,630
Oh, you and that itchy[br]trigger finger of yours.

786
01:07:29,060 --> 01:07:31,520
- Hey, did you hear that?[br]- Sure did, Trigger.

787
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:34,140
There's somethin' funny[br]goin' on around here.

788
01:07:34,230 --> 01:07:37,480
Come on. You cover me.

789
01:07:41,950 --> 01:07:45,870
Wait a minute.[br]Uh, is the safety on Old Betsy?

790
01:07:45,950 --> 01:07:47,230
You bet it is, Sheriff.

791
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:50,190
That's what I'm afraid of.[br]You go first.

792
01:07:52,950 --> 01:07:54,870
All right, you in there!

793
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:57,420
Come out with your hands up!

794
01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:59,130
Yeah. Reach for the sky!

795
01:07:59,210 --> 01:08:02,830
Just you watch[br]this "preformance," partner.

796
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:04,120
Be careful, Rob.

797
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:11,420
Jehoshaphat, Trigger![br]Put that peashooter down.

798
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:15,050
Oh, shucks, Trigger.[br]It's only Nutsy.

799
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:18,390
And "criminently,"[br]get back to your patrol.

800
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:19,880
On the double. Git!

801
01:08:19,980 --> 01:08:21,970
I'm a-gittin'. I'm a-gittin'.

802
01:08:22,060 --> 01:08:25,560
That Trigger.[br]He's gittin' everybody edgy.

803
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:27,200
Nothing's gonna happen.

804
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:31,990
That fat friar is gonna dangle[br]from the gallows come daybreak.

805
01:08:33,650 --> 01:08:35,110
Fine.

806
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:40,610
Why don't ya just sit yourself[br]down here kinda cozy-like?

807
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:42,080
Well, thank ya, Nutsy.

808
01:08:42,170 --> 01:08:46,030
Just close your sleepy little eyeballs.

809
01:08:46,130 --> 01:08:48,530
The sandman's a-comin'.

810
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:54,920
Why don't you, uh,[br]let me loosen that belt?

811
01:08:55,000 --> 01:09:00,680
Rockabye, Sheriff[br]Just you relax

812
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:03,340
I'm relaxing.

813
01:09:20,860 --> 01:09:24,900
Ooh. Oh, Nutsy,[br]that's mighty sweet.

814
01:09:24,990 --> 01:09:26,780
Sing it one more time, will ya?

815
01:09:26,860 --> 01:09:33,040
Rockabye, Sheriff[br]Just you relax

816
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:34,860
I'm relaxing.

817
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:47,800
Wait a minute![br]Jailbreak! Jailbreak!

818
01:09:47,890 --> 01:09:51,300
I heard it! I heard it, Sheriff.[br]The door! The door!

819
01:09:53,050 --> 01:09:57,960
Now, for the last time,[br]no more false alarms.

820
01:09:58,060 --> 01:10:00,470
Now, you release Friar Tuck[br]and the others...

821
01:10:00,570 --> 01:10:03,270
and I'll drop in[br]on the royal treasury.

822
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:16,650
Oh. Little John! It can't be!

823
01:10:16,750 --> 01:10:19,610
Shh. Quiet.[br]We're bustin' outta here.

824
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:21,110
Thank God.

825
01:10:22,250 --> 01:10:24,120
My prayers have been answered.

826
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:45,480
I'm ready.[br]Where's the bad guys?

827
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:47,300
Take it easy, son.

828
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:41,310
Robin Hood?[br]I'll get even. I'll get...

829
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:18,340
It's Robin Hood l-I want.

830
01:13:11,810 --> 01:13:16,220
Praise the Lord,[br]and pass the tax rebate!

831
01:13:18,020 --> 01:13:20,570
Come on. Follow me.

832
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,710
Sheriff, now... now...[br]now don't get your dander up...

833
01:13:41,790 --> 01:13:44,030
but I still got[br]a feelin' that...

834
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:48,740
Friar. Get goin'. Hurry.

835
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:55,970
Guards! Guards! My gold!

836
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:09,820
Oh, no, no, no![br]They're getting away with my gold!

837
01:15:09,910 --> 01:15:12,200
Guards! Guards!

838
01:15:12,290 --> 01:15:14,530
To the jail!

839
01:15:14,620 --> 01:15:17,400
Rhinos, halt! Stop! Desist!

840
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:25,170
Everybody, this way!

841
01:16:01,910 --> 01:16:04,690
That's all of them.[br]Get going!

842
01:16:09,130 --> 01:16:12,750
This ain't no hayride.[br]Let's move it outta here. Ho!

843
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:16,840
On to Sherwood Forest!

844
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:18,830
Stop! My baby!

845
01:16:18,930 --> 01:16:21,500
Mama! Mama! Wait for me!

846
01:16:35,610 --> 01:16:37,510
We got him now.

847
01:16:37,610 --> 01:16:39,400
Keep going.[br]Don't worry about me.

848
01:17:16,850 --> 01:17:19,520
This time we got him for sure.

849
01:17:54,210 --> 01:17:56,620
Shoot him!

850
01:18:08,390 --> 01:18:11,760
Kill him! Kill him!

851
01:18:22,860 --> 01:18:26,110
Come on, Rob. Come on.

852
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:28,780
He's just gotta make it.

853
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:38,460
No. No, no.

854
01:18:38,540 --> 01:18:41,740
Hiss! He's finished![br]Done for!

855
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:44,470
La, la, la

856
01:18:46,390 --> 01:18:51,460
He's gonna make it,[br]isn't he, Little John?

857
01:19:09,150 --> 01:19:11,560
Hey, what's that?

858
01:19:14,330 --> 01:19:17,160
Little John, lookit, lookit.

859
01:19:20,170 --> 01:19:22,160
Hey, what the...

860
01:19:23,250 --> 01:19:26,500
Oh, man, did you[br]have me worried, Rob.

861
01:19:26,580 --> 01:19:28,570
I thought you were long gone.

862
01:19:28,670 --> 01:19:31,630
Ah, not Robin Hood.

863
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:36,760
He could've swum twice that far,[br]huh, Mr Robin Hood, sir?

864
01:19:36,850 --> 01:19:41,420
Look, sire. Look. He's made it.[br]He got away again.

865
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:46,260
A pox on the phoney King of England![br]Oo-de-lally!

866
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:51,100
- Oo-de-lally![br]- Oh, no. It's so miserably unfair.

867
01:19:51,190 --> 01:19:54,780
Well, I tried to tell you,[br]but no, no, no, you wouldn't listen.

868
01:19:54,860 --> 01:19:56,770
Your traps just never work.

869
01:19:56,860 --> 01:19:59,570
And now look what you've done[br]to your mother's castle.

870
01:20:01,700 --> 01:20:03,610
Mommy!

871
01:20:06,750 --> 01:20:09,700
- Hold still, you cowardly cobra![br]- Sire, no!

872
01:20:09,790 --> 01:20:12,030
Please! Oh! No!

873
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:15,040
Procrastinating python.

874
01:20:17,220 --> 01:20:20,920
Aggravating asp!

875
01:20:21,010 --> 01:20:24,960
- You eel in snake's clothing.[br]- Help!

876
01:20:25,050 --> 01:20:30,430
He's gone stark raving mad!

877
01:20:45,260 --> 01:20:49,010
You know, I thought we'd never[br]get rid of those two rascals.

878
01:20:49,110 --> 01:20:51,890
But lucky for us folks,[br]King Richard returned...

879
01:20:51,980 --> 01:20:55,100
and, well, he-he just[br]straightened everything out.

880
01:21:08,410 --> 01:21:12,280
Say, we better get over to the church.[br]Sounds like somebody's gettin' hitched.

881
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:18,670
Long live Robin Hood!

882
01:21:25,050 --> 01:21:28,500
Long live King Richard!

883
01:21:28,590 --> 01:21:30,220
Oh, Friar Tuck.

884
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:34,720
It appears that I now have[br]an outlaw for an in-law.

885
01:21:36,940 --> 01:21:38,970
It's not bad.

886
01:21:43,570 --> 01:21:46,850
Gee, Skippy,[br]how come you're goin'?

887
01:21:46,940 --> 01:21:49,570
Well, Robin Hood's[br]gonna have kids...

888
01:21:49,660 --> 01:21:52,490
so somebody's gotta[br]keep their eye on things.

889
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:57,150
Ho!

890
01:21:58,120 --> 01:22:03,320
Oh! I've never been so happy.

891
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:23,640
Hey, here come the bride, Trigger.

892
01:22:23,730 --> 01:22:26,650
"Persent" arms!

893
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:40,150
Well, folks, that's the way[br]it really happened.

894
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:46,610
Love goes on and on

895
01:22:46,700 --> 01:22:49,980
Oo- de-lally, oo-de-lally[br]Golly, what a day

896
01:22:50,090 --> 01:22:51,660
Oo- de-lally, oo-de-lally[br]Golly, what a day
