and people are a bit out of sorts,

but there is no reason to be mad at me
just because I have a corn on my foot.

I have something important to say.

from the Board of Regents.

00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:47,791
Good. The Board of Regents.
How is the board these days?

30
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:51,462
- Disappointed.
- Disappointed?

31
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:52,922
Disappointed.

- Disapp... Uh, about what?
- Plenty.

here at the school are overwhelming.

Well, so do I.

00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,390

Top level changes, Higgins.

37
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:12,353
That's what the board wants
and, frankly, I agree.

00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:15,193
Oh, uh, good thinking, Dietz.

00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:19,242

Yes, Higgins. Top level.

Well, surely not the very
tippy-tippy-tippy top.

tippy top.

50
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:54,187
Let's face it, Higgins.

51
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:57,265
You've had years to get this place
back on its financial feet

52
00:05:57,358 --> 00:05:58,978
and you haven't done it.

53
00:05:59,068 --> 00:06:01,608
Waste. Waste, waste.

54
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,985
Here. Look at this budget.

55
00:06:04,073 --> 00:06:07,493
Well, the costs for the science
department alone, they're ridiculous.

56
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:11,326
Oh, the science...
That's that Quigley again. Oh, I know.

57
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:15,633
I'll fire him. That'll end the waste.
Oh, I guarantee that.

58
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:18,797
Quigley out, waste out. You'll see. Ohh...

59
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:23,297
I'm afraid firing Quigley is not going to
satisfy the Board of Regents.

60
00:06:23,801 --> 00:06:26,931
Now, Higgins, let's not
make a problem out of this.

61
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,310
Why don't you just
step down gracefully?

62
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:32,060
Step down? Well, I can't step down.

63
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:36,062
I'm right in the middle
of my, uh, uh, my promotional program.

64
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:38,436
- Promotional program?
- Yes!

65
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:41,362
To raise money.
That's what you want, isn't it? Money?

66
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:43,403
Yes, money. But how...

67
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:45,817
How? Don't you worry about...

68
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,576
Uh, uh, all I need is 30 days.

69
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:50,787

70
00:06:50,828 --> 00:06:53,078
Thirty days, Regent Dietz.

71
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:55,922

tell the Board of Regents.

in me is amply rewarded.

75
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:08,966
- What confidence?
- "What con..." Ohh. (CHUCKLES)

76
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:11,432
In 30 days, the changes
you'll find around...

77
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:14,435
Higgins, I've already told you,
you have your 30 days.

78
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:15,888
But do something.

79
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:18,898
Let's get some order restored
around this place above all,

80
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:21,731
and no more expensive nonsense.

81
00:07:23,444 --> 00:07:27,994
Uh, regent Dietz, there is no nonsense
going on around here, I can assure you.

82
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:32,201
If there were, I would see it.
Nothing escapes my eye.

83
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:38,963
Higgins, what are you doing?

84
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:40,882
How... What... What am I doing?

85
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,591
- Uh, you forgot something.
- Forgot something?

86
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:45,471
Yes, you forgot your, uh... Oh, your hat.

87
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:47,049
Oh, yes.

88
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:57,771
Wait a minute. This is not my hat.

89
00:07:57,853 --> 00:08:00,113
As a matter of fact,
I wasn't even wearing a hat.

90
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:01,399
Oh, that's right.

91
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,230
That's my hat.
I thought I recognized that.

92
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:13,451
Oh, and tell
the Board of Regents to cheer up.

93

95
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:27,723
Type something.

96
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,596
A little higher on your side.

97

99

That's terrific, Schuyler.

100
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:40,904
Yeah, it does
look pretty good, doesn't it?

101
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:45,442
You know, I'm not sure
a cow twice as starved as Ruthybelle

102
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:47,526
would have anything to do with this stuff.

103
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:52,163
Well, it's probably
that acid taste she doesn't like.

104
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:54,581
You get rid of that
and she'll probably like it.

105
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:57,703
Yeah. Maybe you're right.

106
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,620
Carry on.

107
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:12,588
Good morning.

108
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:14,176
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Dean Higgins.

109
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:16,643
- All right, where is he?
- Hey, dean, what happened to your foot?

110
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:19,062
- Never mind my foot. Where is he?
- Who?

111
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,812
- Who? Quigley who. That's who.
- Isn't he here?

112
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,555
Uh, he'll be a few minutes late.

113
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:27,107
He just dropped by the supply room to
pick up a few more test tubes.

114
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:30,280

he leaves you people alone?

Well, sure. Why not?

116
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:33,662

we can do for you?

124
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,672
No, there isn't anything
you can do for me.

125
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:53,717
I just came up here to make
a little announcement.

126
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:55,392
Back to work.

127
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:02,351
A little announcement? Hey, maybe he's
going to give Quigley promotion.

128
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:04,104
Yeah, wouldn't that be something.

129
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:11,191
If it isn't asking too much,

130
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:15,448
do you think I would be going beyond
my prerogatives as dean of this college

131
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:17,242
to ask you what you're doing?

132
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:18,696
Oh, no, sir.

133
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:21,463
Well, what are you doing?

134
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:22,748
Well, I'm crushing vitamins.

135
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:25,461
I can see that. Any fool can see that.

136
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,502
- What for?
- Oh, for the cow, sir.

137
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:30,054
Everything we do
around here is for the cow.

138
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:34,087
You mean to tell me that you're crushing
up perfectly good vitamins

139
00:10:34,176 --> 00:10:35,466
to feed to a cow?

140
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:39,352
Well, yes, sir. That's how we're gonna
cure Ruthybelle's nutritional problem.

141
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,309
- Who?
- Ruthybelle. The cow.

142
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,521
As you can see, she's sort of skinny.

143
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,350
Hopefully we'll end up with a fat cow.

144
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:50,073
So that's what all this expense is for.
To make a cow fat.

145
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:53,398
Oh, not only fat, sir,
but a strong cow too.

146
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:56,405
- Thrilling, isn't it?
- I'm overwhelmed.

147
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:57,618
I knew you would be.

148
00:10:57,699 --> 00:10:59,369
- You see, it was really my idea.
- I thought so.

149
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:02,619
The kids are just helping me out.
Uh, if you'll excuse me.

150
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,920
Shorty, I need another piece of pizza.

151
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,578
The flavor's not quite right yet.

152
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,585
One piece of pizza coming up.

153
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:14,218
- Pizza?
- Yeah, and she seems to like it too.

154
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:17,886
Do you think maybe she's Italian?
(LAUGHING)

155
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:22,022
- That's not funny, Schuyler.
- Don't you get it?

156
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:24,349
An Italian cow eating pizza.

157
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,404
An Italian cow!

158
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:27,806
That kills me!

159
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:29,766

Dean Higgins?

00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:31,775
He is. I'm not.

161
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:35,448
Oh, I see.
Well, it's nice of you to come by.

162
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:38,619
- May I show you around?
- No, you may not show me around.

163
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:40,327
I've already been shown enough

164
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:43,999
with this vitamin-grinding numbskull
that calls himself a science major.

165
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,079
- I heard that, sir.
- Good!

166
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:48,633
That's not all I have to say, Quigley.

167
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:53,339
Do you have any idea
how much this operation is costing you?

168
00:11:53,422 --> 00:11:56,682
Well, not really, sir, but we're cutting
back everywhere we can.

169
00:11:56,758 --> 00:12:00,138
- You take the cow rental, for instance.
- HIGGINS: Cow rental?

170

Yes, for heaven's sakes, let him
down before he breaks something.

- How did all this happen with the...
- I don't know.

348
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:02,731
I just ate some of Schuyler's cereal,
and all of a sudden I got strong.

349
00:24:02,817 --> 00:24:04,067
Let me see that cereal.

350
00:24:06,404 --> 00:24:09,244
This is the same cereal
I eat every morning. I never get strong.

351
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:12,987
Well, of course not.
It's not the cereal that made him strong.

352
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:16,575
It was, well,
Professor Quigley's and my formula.

353
00:24:16,664 --> 00:24:18,714
Just plain cereal
wouldn't do anything like that,

354
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:21,041
no matter what those companies say.

355
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:22,667
I know.

356
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:27,835
- What's the matter, Dean?
- Hmm?

357
00:24:27,884 --> 00:24:29,844
Oh, uh, nothing. Nothing.

358
00:24:29,886 --> 00:24:33,556
Would you young people mind waiting
outside for a moment? You too, Elmer.

There you go. Everybody out.

I want to talk to Professor Quigley alone
for a moment.

00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:39,647
You mean he's still working here?

362

Would you do something about that?

Everybody out. Here we go.

00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:52,953
Bye-bye. (CHUCKLES)
Aren't they wonderful?

367
00:24:53,034 --> 00:24:56,544
Quigley, do you realize
what we have here?

368
00:24:56,579 --> 00:24:58,709
Well, it seems as though
we might have

369
00:24:58,748 --> 00:25:01,078
quite an amazing
scientific development.

370
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:03,705
It is more than that, Quigley.

371
00:25:03,753 --> 00:25:06,423
Do you realize what
these cereal companies would give

372
00:25:06,506 --> 00:25:09,426
to have a strength formula
like this in their cereal?

373
00:25:09,467 --> 00:25:12,847
- No. Never really thought about it.
- Well, you think about it.

374
00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:14,259
You think about it!

375
00:25:14,305 --> 00:25:17,765
Why, we've got something here that will
get this school out of hock forever.

of scientific experiments.

Besides, if something doesn't
happen around here pretty soon,

you'll be out of a job.

- Obviously a charlatan. A dime a dozen.

Can you imagine the boss falling
for a thing like this? Over the hill.

Should step down, let a younger
person run things around here.

the chairman of the board

However, I would like
to welcome Dean Higgins

for a few minutes.

That's quite all right.
My time is your time, gentlemen.

Yes. Unfortunately, our time is not yours.

To tell you the truth,
we don't exactly know.

That depends on the person

of the strength is definitely limited.

he'd have to eat more cereal to regain it.

00:35:47,813 --> 00:35:50,523
Good. Stanley, put the phone together...

513
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:54,403
And then get me Kirwood Krinkle

514
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:57,236
of the Krinkle Krunch cereal company.

515
00:35:57,281 --> 00:36:01,291
Krinkle? Aunt Harriet, what are
you doing, talking to Krinkle?

516
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:03,078
(BOARD MEMBERS CLAMORING)

517
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:10,423
Just you wait and see.

518
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:14,130
A weight lifting contest
between State and Medfield?

519
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:18,224
But we were national champions
last year. I mean, State, that is.

520
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,300
You know, I went there.

521
00:36:19,595 --> 00:36:22,505
Oh, I believe
everyone knows that, Kirwood.

522
00:36:23,265 --> 00:36:25,515
But really, Harriet,
what is the point of all this?

523
00:36:26,602 --> 00:36:29,562
I am proposing, in the interest of sports

524
00:36:29,605 --> 00:36:31,565
and the cereal business, of course,

525
00:36:31,607 --> 00:36:35,737
that a much-publicized match be held
between State and Medfield

526
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:37,861
in which your company
will support State

527
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:39,736
and my company will support Medfield.

528
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:42,912
That way, the public can determine

529
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:46,711
which is the number-one
weight lifting team in America,

530
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:49,628
and perhaps the number-one
cereal company.

531
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:53,165
But, Harriet, we are the
number-one cereal company already.

532
00:36:53,253 --> 00:36:56,473
- Remember?
- Oh, I know that.

533
00:36:56,506 --> 00:36:58,296
And I understand

534
00:36:58,342 --> 00:37:02,762
if you don't want to put
your number-one position in jeopardy.

535
00:37:03,305 --> 00:37:06,975
Nonsense. Krinkle Krunch is
always ready for competition.

536
00:37:07,059 --> 00:37:09,309
Besides, what a great publicity idea.

537
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:13,654
You know, Harriet, sometimes
I think you're a wonder. Just a wonder.

538
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,440
Good-bye, Harriet.

539
00:37:17,486 --> 00:37:20,066
Medfield vs. State. What a laugh.

540
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:22,065
We'll murder 'em. Right, men?

541
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:23,577
ALL: Right!

542
00:37:25,786 --> 00:37:27,156
Uh, right.

543
00:37:28,455 --> 00:37:30,705
- (CLEARS THROAT)
- Yes, Uncle Frederick?

544
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:34,843
Don't you think we should remind
Dean Higgins of one little problem?

545
00:37:36,088 --> 00:37:37,708
Problem? What, uh, problem?

546
00:37:38,257 --> 00:37:39,627
Spies!

547
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:42,012
"Spies"?

548
00:37:42,052 --> 00:37:45,062
He means industrial spies,
Dean Higgins.

549
00:37:45,138 --> 00:37:48,928
There is no length to which the Krinkle
Krunch company would not go

550
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:51,057
to learn our plans.

551
00:37:51,144 --> 00:37:54,654
Oh. Well, I can assure you
that this project will be top secret.

552
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:58,190
I'll see that the lab is
placed under maximum security.

553
00:37:58,235 --> 00:38:00,525
You won't have to
worry about any spies.

554
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:01,662
(CHUCKLES)

555
00:38:01,697 --> 00:38:06,197
That's fine. Of course we do
have a few spies of our own.

556
00:38:06,285 --> 00:38:09,745
But the ones
from Krinkle Krunch are everywhere.

557
00:38:10,247 --> 00:38:14,077
It's just that we don't know who they are.

558
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:33,730
- This is me.
- This is me.

559
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:35,519
Good. Were you followed?

560
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:38,395
I don't think so.

561
00:38:38,942 --> 00:38:41,782
- What is it, Harry?
- You're in trouble, Krinkle.

562
00:38:43,071 --> 00:38:44,411
- Trouble?
- Yes.

563
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:46,579
That weight lifting match. Withdraw.

564
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:48,238
Withdraw? You're kidding.

565
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,580
State has the greatest
weight lifting team in the country.

566
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,460
We'll wipe Medfield right off the map.

567
00:38:52,581 --> 00:38:55,751
- She's sandbagging you, Krinkle.
- Sandbagging me?

568
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:58,671
Yes. That Medfield bunch
have come up with a strength formula

569
00:38:58,754 --> 00:39:00,594
they're putting in Aunt Harriet's cereal

570
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:03,050
that will literally knock
your number-one out.

571
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:04,931
I'm telling you, withdraw.

572
00:39:05,427 --> 00:39:06,467
I can't withdraw.

573
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:08,643
I just had a press conference.
I announced the whole thing.

574
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:11,559
In fact, I even bragged a little.

575
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,690
Then you're going to be
number two, Krinkle.

576
00:39:13,769 --> 00:39:17,439
I saw a demonstration of how that
formula works and, believe me,

577
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:19,402
Medfield is going to murder State.

578
00:39:19,441 --> 00:39:21,531
Medfield's not gonna murder State,

579
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:23,700
and Krinkle Krunch'll
never be number two.

580
00:39:23,779 --> 00:39:27,029
Now, look, Harry,
I'm counting on you to get that formula.

581
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:28,985
It's worth $100,000 to me.

582
00:39:29,076 --> 00:39:33,406
- It's worth a lot more than that.
- All right, 150.

583
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:37,995
150 is okay for me,
but this is a big job. I'll need help.

584
00:39:39,378 --> 00:39:41,628
All right, another 50 for the help,

585
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:43,973
but for heaven's sakes,
get some good people.

586
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:46,509
Don't you worry
about a thing, Mr. Krinkle.

587
00:39:46,593 --> 00:39:48,723
I think I have the right party in mind.

588
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:50,555
Exactly the right party.

Always a pleasure to visit you,
just so it's not for too long.

00:40:16,665 --> 00:40:20,585
Well, Mr. Arno,
you come any time, and just consider...

593
00:40:20,669 --> 00:40:22,999
Our house is your house.

00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:25,338
That's very good. (CHUCKLES)

Thanks a lot. Come on.

What does he mean,
their house is our house?

597
00:40:29,678 --> 00:40:32,388
It ain't my house. I never wanna go
back to that joint again.

He's just puttin' you on, stupid.

599
00:40:34,558 --> 00:40:38,058
Besides, we won't have to go back there
again if you don't louse up anymore.

600
00:40:38,687 --> 00:40:42,017
Why do you always blame me every time
we get into predicaments like this?

601
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:46,235
Because it's your stupidity that gets us
into these predicaments, that's why.

As I said, things couldn't be
better. How about you?

608
00:41:05,755 --> 00:41:07,965
Well, as you can see
I've had a temporary setback,

609
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:09,299
but don't let that worry you.

610
00:41:09,384 --> 00:41:10,804

You gonna start that kinda talk again?

618
00:41:27,903 --> 00:41:30,493
You keep that up, you're gonna
cause me to lose my confidence.

619

Oh, yeah? (LAUGHING)
Hey, what's the caper, Harry?

620
00:41:33,742 --> 00:41:37,082
I'll tell you all about it
on the way to town. Get in.

621
00:41:38,371 --> 00:41:40,621
But, boss, I don't care
what that guy Harry says.

622
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:43,627
Every time we get mixed up with them
Medfield kids, we end up in jail,

623
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:45,250
and I don't wanna go to jail no more.

624
00:41:45,337 --> 00:41:48,507
I don't go for that "Our house
is your house" stuff anymore.

625
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:50,470
Cookie, nobody's goin' to jail.

626
00:41:50,926 --> 00:41:53,796
It's a real simple job that we're getting
paid a lot of money for.

627
00:41:54,054 --> 00:41:57,684
All we have to do is find out where the
formula is and go in and get it.

628
00:41:57,766 --> 00:42:00,016
- You say that's simple?
- Why, sure.

629
00:42:01,228 --> 00:42:04,608
As a matter of fact, it's so simple
I'm gonna let you handle it yourself.

630
00:42:05,482 --> 00:42:07,322
Yeah? All by myself?

631
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:09,819
All by yourself.

632
00:42:09,903 --> 00:42:11,613
It's a chance to prove yourself.

633
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:15,116
You'll figure it out, you'll do
the leading, I'll do the following.

634
00:42:15,158 --> 00:42:18,328
You really mean that, boss?
I do the leadin', you do the followin'?

635
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:20,121
That's what I said.

636
00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:26,461
Yeah, I like that.

637
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:30,130
I lead, he follows.

638
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:33,338
Terrific.

639
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:51,320
All right, now here's the plan.

640
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,700
When that truck leaves
we go around the back of the building,

641
00:42:54,781 --> 00:42:58,661
up on the roof, over onto the scaffolding
and down in front of the lab window.

642
00:42:58,702 --> 00:43:00,502
The formula's in there.

643
00:43:00,537 --> 00:43:02,457
I don't like this scaffold business.

644
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:04,787
But, boss,
I cased this joint this afternoon.

645
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,670
The halls are loaded
with security guards.

646
00:43:07,711 --> 00:43:10,051
It's the window or nothin'.
We gotta use the scaffold.

647
00:43:10,672 --> 00:43:14,262
- All right, but I still don't like it.
- Here. Wear these.

648
00:43:14,676 --> 00:43:17,886
- What for?
- For the ropes of the scaffold.

649
00:43:17,971 --> 00:43:20,181
- What, are you stupid?
- Who's stupid?

650
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,520
I don't like takin' orders from you.

651
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:24,479
But, boss, don't you
remember you said to me,

652
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:26,899
"Hey, you lead and I'll follow"? Quote.

653
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:29,860
Yeah, and that's the stupidest thing
I ever did in my life.

655
00:43:38,074 --> 00:43:39,744
Okay, follow me.

Come on, come on.

657
00:43:46,541 --> 00:43:49,291
Hey, it's windier up here
than it is down there.

658
00:43:49,377 --> 00:43:52,257
Yeah, because it's higher up here
than it is down there.

659
00:43:52,339 --> 00:43:53,339
I know that!

660
00:43:54,215 --> 00:43:57,215
- Come on, boss. Come on.
- All right. I'm comin', I'm comin'.

661
00:43:59,054 --> 00:44:00,764
Come on, come on.

00:44:41,304 --> 00:44:42,764
And you're an idiot.

678
00:44:42,806 --> 00:44:44,766
What are you tryin' to do, kill me?

679
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:48,346
All you had to do was let go of the
wall. The whole thing was lopsided.

680
00:44:48,436 --> 00:44:51,396
I'll say, this whole thing's lopsided.
I'm gettin' up there again.

681
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:54,149
You don't wanna get off now.
The worst part's over.

682
00:44:54,234 --> 00:44:56,494
The rest is a cinch, I'm tellin' ya.

683
00:44:56,569 --> 00:44:58,779
All we gotta do is
work these ropes here,

684
00:44:58,905 --> 00:45:00,815
we go down nice and easy
to the window.

685
00:45:00,907 --> 00:45:02,077
- Yeah?
- Come on, get the rope.

686
00:45:02,117 --> 00:45:03,447
This I gotta see.

687
00:45:04,411 --> 00:45:06,831
Uh, you're sure you know how to
work those ropes, right?

688
00:45:06,913 --> 00:45:07,963
Sure I'm sure.

689
00:45:08,123 --> 00:45:10,923
I worked on 'em today all by myself
with a phony window washing job.

690
00:45:11,584 --> 00:45:14,344
Now with you helping me,
it should be a snap here.

691
00:45:14,421 --> 00:45:16,511
All we gotta do is release it together,

692
00:45:16,589 --> 00:45:19,429
a notch at a time,
and we go down nice and slow.

693
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:20,967
- Yeah.
- Ready?

694
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:23,300
- Okay.
- Okay, boss, lower away.

695
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,060
- Ooh.
- There. You see, boss?

696
00:45:26,141 --> 00:45:28,851
Yeah. Yeah, this works pretty good.

697
00:45:28,935 --> 00:45:31,055
Oooh. Ohh.

698
00:45:32,564 --> 00:45:34,234
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.

699
00:45:34,315 --> 00:45:35,605
This does work pretty good.

700
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:38,240
Sure it does.
I told you I had it all worked out.

701
00:45:38,737 --> 00:45:41,657
You know, boss, you got all choked
up and froze over nothin'.

702
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:43,320
That ain't good for your heart.

703
00:45:43,366 --> 00:45:47,366
And another thing. You gotta trust other
people to figure things out sometimes.

704
00:45:47,454 --> 00:45:49,374
Oh, yeah?
Trust other people? Like who?

705
00:45:49,456 --> 00:45:51,706
Well, people like me, for instance.

- Give me your arm, boss!

- Give me your arm!
- ARNO: Get me up, you idiot!

709
00:46:02,427 --> 00:46:05,557
I can't get up! Ohh! Oh, my arm!

for bein' scared, boss.

00:46:13,688 --> 00:46:16,318
- For a minute I thought you was a goner.
- Aah, you idiot!

713
00:46:16,858 --> 00:46:18,938
It wasn't me, boss.
It was the rope. It got a knot in it.

714
00:46:19,027 --> 00:46:20,647
You got a knot in your head!

715
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:24,870
Just stay there, boss. No problem.

716
00:46:24,949 --> 00:46:26,449
I'm not stayin' anywhere.

717
00:46:26,534 --> 00:46:29,374

- Take it ea...
- Uh-huh. I got ya.

Oh, that smarts. Ohh.

729
00:47:05,782 --> 00:47:07,082
You did that on purpose!

730
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:10,198
Boss, here we are,
right at the window, just like I said!

731
00:47:10,245 --> 00:47:14,075
- Look. We just gotta go in here. Yeah.
- Oh. Oh.

732
00:47:18,127 --> 00:47:20,337
Goin' back, we take the stairs.

733
00:47:20,421 --> 00:47:23,341
You can't. The halls are
loaded with those security guys.

734
00:47:23,424 --> 00:47:25,224
I'll take my chances with
those security guards.

735
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:27,180
I'm not goin' back on
that scaffold with you.

736
00:47:27,262 --> 00:47:29,182
But I know how to work the ropes now.

737
00:47:29,264 --> 00:47:31,184
I don't wanna hear
any more about those ropes.

738
00:47:31,266 --> 00:47:32,926
Now, let's get that formula
and be quick about it.

739
00:47:33,017 --> 00:47:34,057
All right, no problem.

740
00:47:34,102 --> 00:47:36,102
It should be right over here.

741
00:47:37,939 --> 00:47:41,319
Yeah. The kid was workin'
at this desk today.

742
00:47:41,901 --> 00:47:43,441
Let's see here.

743
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:49,581
I thought he put it in
one of these drawers here.

744
00:47:50,451 --> 00:47:53,331
- That's funny.
- Funny? What's funny about it?

745
00:47:53,413 --> 00:47:54,793
You drag me here
in the middle of the night,

746
00:47:54,831 --> 00:47:56,621
almost get me killed on
that stupid scaffold,

747
00:47:56,666 --> 00:47:58,416
and all you can say is, "That's funny"?

748
00:47:58,459 --> 00:48:00,339
But, boss, it's gotta be here someplace.

749
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:03,880
I could swear the kid put it
in one of these drawers, I'm tellin' ya.

750
00:48:06,301 --> 00:48:09,141
Wait a second.
I was washin' that window there.

751
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:12,140
I look through,
I see the kid workin' around here.

752
00:48:12,473 --> 00:48:13,813
It's funny.

753
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:16,190
Will you quit sayin' funny
and find that formula!

754
00:48:16,269 --> 00:48:17,939
I'll find it, boss. I'll find it.

755
00:48:17,979 --> 00:48:19,649
You'd better. It's worth 50,000 bucks.

What?

760
00:48:30,533 --> 00:48:32,163

764

You know how those security guys are.

765
00:48:40,752 --> 00:48:43,342
They're probably picking up
everything we say right now.

766
00:48:43,421 --> 00:48:47,301
That's it. We'd better get outta
here in a hurry, but quietly.

767

But boss, wait a second.
You can't go out there.

we gotta go back there.

We can't do that.

one way I know of to get that formula.

a few blocks down, so we picked him up.

822

His address was on his collar. We were
just taking him there when we saw you.

How do I know he's kidnapped?

846
00:53:33,794 --> 00:53:37,634
Because he's been out looking for his
dog for three hours. That's how I know.

847
00:53:37,715 --> 00:53:42,795
Well, Dean Higgins, a boy looking for
his dog for three hours is not unusual.

848
00:53:42,887 --> 00:53:44,427
Well, it is when you consider

849
00:53:44,472 --> 00:53:47,682
that the dog has been back
for two hours and 45 minutes.

850
00:53:48,059 --> 00:53:49,349
I'm sorry, Dean Higgins,

851
00:53:49,435 --> 00:53:51,435
but the department
can't get all ruffled over this.

852
00:53:51,479 --> 00:53:53,689
I do have a suggestion to make, though.

853
00:53:53,773 --> 00:53:55,073
<i>What's that?</i>

854
00:53:55,149 --> 00:53:59,779
Well, if the dog was lost and was able to
find his way home in 15 minutes,

855
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:02,370
why don't you send the
dog out to find the boy

856
00:54:02,448 --> 00:54:05,078
<i>and don't bother
the department about it? How's that?</i>

857
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:07,699
I don't like it,
and I don't like your attitude.

858
00:54:07,787 --> 00:54:09,157
Let me speak to the chief.

859
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:11,330
<i>I'm sorry, the chief is not available.</i>

860
00:54:11,415 --> 00:54:13,535
He is out addressing a Chinese dinner.

861
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:15,841
A Chinese dinner?

862
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:19,220
You mean, with all of these
vicious kidnappings going on,

863
00:54:19,298 --> 00:54:22,758
<i>the chief of police of this city
is at a Chinese restaurant</i>

864
00:54:22,843 --> 00:54:25,473
stuffing his face with rice and noodles?

865
00:54:26,013 --> 00:54:27,433
Yes!

866
00:54:28,349 --> 00:54:30,019
Thank you. Thank you.

867
00:54:30,518 --> 00:54:33,438
I'm sure I don't need
to tell you gentlemen

868
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:35,820
that I didn't come
down here to Chinatown

869
00:54:35,856 --> 00:54:39,146
just to stuff my face
full of rice and noodles.

870
00:54:39,193 --> 00:54:41,863
(LAUGHS) Rice and nood...

871
00:54:42,488 --> 00:54:44,028
(CLEARS THROAT) Well, I...

872
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:47,990
In any event, they're very tasty.
My compliments to the chef.

873
00:54:49,036 --> 00:54:52,366
No, I have more
important things to do than that.

874
00:54:53,374 --> 00:54:58,844
I'm down here, gentlemen, to talk to you
on behalf of our police department.

875
00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:05,430
SCHUYLER: Honest.
You gotta believe me.

876
00:55:05,511 --> 00:55:08,681
I don't know where the formula is, and I
don't know what's in the formula.

877
00:55:08,723 --> 00:55:12,103
COOKIE: Boss, I hate to do this,
but I gotta get rough with this kid.

878
00:55:12,184 --> 00:55:15,234
Five minutes, I find out. It always works.

879
00:55:15,271 --> 00:55:16,521
Honorable sir.

880
00:55:17,732 --> 00:55:20,112
I admire your enthusiasm,

881
00:55:20,192 --> 00:55:22,612
but this boy can never tell you
what is in the formula,

882
00:55:22,695 --> 00:55:24,735
because he thinks he doesn't know.

883
00:55:25,197 --> 00:55:26,407
How do you know?

884
00:55:27,616 --> 00:55:28,986
I know.

885
00:55:29,076 --> 00:55:30,536
You see, stupid? He knows.

886
00:55:30,578 --> 00:55:32,408
Now, will you shut up?

887
00:55:32,455 --> 00:55:36,245
In order to find truth,
I must put boy in deep sleep.

888
00:55:36,917 --> 00:55:39,547
Then he will tell us all he knows.

889
00:55:40,046 --> 00:55:42,796
Aw, boss, this guy's
gotta be kiddin'. Come on.

890
00:55:42,882 --> 00:55:44,302
Be patient.

891
00:55:48,095 --> 00:55:49,885
You will see, my son.

892
00:55:51,849 --> 00:55:53,139
"My son"?

893
00:55:56,103 --> 00:55:58,313
Where does he get off
calling me his son?

894
00:55:58,397 --> 00:56:00,567
- Maybe he likes you.
- Well, I don't like him.

895
00:56:00,608 --> 00:56:02,278
He gives me one of those complexions,

896
00:56:02,318 --> 00:56:04,448
like maybe I'm not
as smart as he is, or something.

897
00:56:04,528 --> 00:56:07,108
He does, eh? I wonder why.

898
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:17,710
Now what's he gonna do?

899
00:56:21,796 --> 00:56:25,416
With your permission,
what you Americans call brainwash.

900
00:56:26,008 --> 00:56:27,178
Brainwash?

901
00:56:27,259 --> 00:56:28,969
Boss, I don't go
for this hocus-pocus stuff.

902
00:56:29,387 --> 00:56:30,427
Neither do I.

903
00:56:30,471 --> 00:56:32,311
Why don't we just go back
to the old-fashion method,

904
00:56:32,348 --> 00:56:33,968
belt the kid around
and get the information?

905
00:56:34,016 --> 00:56:36,306
Will you be quiet?
I'm paying Fong to do this.

906
00:56:38,562 --> 00:56:41,982
Now will put boy in hypnotic trance.

907
00:56:42,525 --> 00:56:44,315
Cause deep sleep.

908
00:56:44,985 --> 00:56:48,315
Make patient feel very happy.

909
00:56:48,364 --> 00:56:51,084
Very happy's okay,
but what's with that needle there?

910
00:56:51,826 --> 00:56:53,366
Must use acupuncture.

911
00:56:53,828 --> 00:56:56,078
Fashionable today
among modern Chinese.

912
00:56:59,041 --> 00:57:00,461
Mallet, please.

913
00:57:06,841 --> 00:57:08,631
This won't hurt, my son.

914
00:57:15,307 --> 00:57:17,847
FONG: See? Patient happy.

915
00:57:18,644 --> 00:57:21,444
You are very tired, my son.

916
00:57:22,773 --> 00:57:24,943
Your eyes are heavy.

917
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:29,859
You will sleep, you will be happy.

918
00:57:30,906 --> 00:57:34,696
And you will go into a deep, deep sleep.

919
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:39,671
When I snap my fingers,

920
00:57:39,707 --> 00:57:41,417
you will open your eyes,

921
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:43,790
and answer my questions,

922
00:57:44,211 --> 00:57:46,551
though you will still be asleep.

923
00:57:47,548 --> 00:57:49,218
(SNAPS FINGERS)

924
00:57:50,468 --> 00:57:52,298
Hey, would you look at that.

925
00:57:54,513 --> 00:57:56,893
FONG: Remember, we are your friends.

926
00:57:57,975 --> 00:58:00,935
You shall tell us everything you know.

927
00:58:01,812 --> 00:58:05,072
Everything. Right from the beginning.

928
00:58:06,066 --> 00:58:08,436
Right from the beginning.

929
00:58:10,362 --> 00:58:11,862
Oh, yes.

930
00:58:13,616 --> 00:58:15,326
Mary had a little lamb,

931
00:58:16,076 --> 00:58:17,826
whose fleece was white as snow.

932
00:58:17,912 --> 00:58:19,212
What?

933
00:58:19,788 --> 00:58:21,788
Not quite that far back.

934
00:58:23,167 --> 00:58:25,337
Tell us about the formula.

935
00:58:26,378 --> 00:58:28,758
Do you remember what

936
00:58:28,839 --> 00:58:31,759
you put into your strength formula?

937
00:58:32,676 --> 00:58:35,886
Oh, yes, I do remember what I put

938
00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:37,390
in my strength formula.

939
00:58:37,973 --> 00:58:39,183
Proceed, please.

940
00:58:39,642 --> 00:58:44,732
Unit consistency,
600 decagrams, thymine.

941
00:58:44,772 --> 00:58:48,072
700 centigrams, calcium pentethemate.

942
00:58:48,776 --> 00:58:50,946
900 milligrams, niacin.

943
00:58:50,986 --> 00:58:52,196
Not so fast!

944
00:58:52,279 --> 00:58:55,819
450 centigrams, pyridoxine.

945
00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:59,950
500 milligrams, pyridexamine.

946
00:59:00,246 --> 00:59:02,286
(MUMBLING)

947
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:07,800
What did he say? What did he say?

948
00:59:07,878 --> 00:59:09,128
That must be all.

949
00:59:10,256 --> 00:59:11,916
There's got to be more than that.

950
00:59:13,676 --> 00:59:16,386
We shall see. Another needle, please.

951
00:59:19,974 --> 00:59:23,604
For the life of me I cannot understand
what has happened to that boy.

952
00:59:23,644 --> 00:59:26,314
Frankly, Dean Higgins,
I find it all very mystifying.

953
00:59:26,397 --> 00:59:28,517
- (PHONE RINGING)
- That could be him now.

954
00:59:28,607 --> 00:59:29,817
I hope so.

955
00:59:29,858 --> 00:59:30,938
Dean Higgins here.

956
00:59:31,277 --> 00:59:32,947
Harriet Crumply here.

957
00:59:32,987 --> 00:59:35,657
Oh, ha... Aunt Harriet.

958
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:37,120
Uh, how are you?

959
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:39,660
Absolutely miserable.

960
00:59:39,994 --> 00:59:42,004
What seems to be
bothering you, aunt Harriet?

961
00:59:42,413 --> 00:59:45,503
I don't know.
Maybe it's just woman's intuition,

962
00:59:46,333 --> 00:59:49,213
<i>but I have the strangest feeling.</i>

963
00:59:49,295 --> 00:59:51,005
<i>- I can't pin it down.</i>
- (COUGHS)

964
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:55,470
Dean Higgins, is everything
going along all right?

965
00:59:56,176 --> 00:59:58,136
(COUGHS)
Everything is wonderful here.

966
00:59:58,387 --> 01:00:01,847
It's fine. I mean, uh,
wouldn't I have called you if it weren't?

967
01:00:02,266 --> 01:00:06,226
Oh, good.
I'm glad to have your reassurances.

968
01:00:06,312 --> 01:00:09,442
You know,
everything I have is tied up in this.

969
01:00:09,523 --> 01:00:12,863
If we were to lose,
I don't know what I'd do.

970
01:00:13,569 --> 01:00:17,359
No. Uh, well, frankly,
my future wouldn't look too bright either.

971
01:00:17,823 --> 01:00:19,073
HARRIET: <i>Well, good.</i>

972
01:00:19,158 --> 01:00:21,488
<i>I'm glad there's nothing
to worry about then.</i>

973
01:00:22,536 --> 01:00:23,906
Good night, Dean Higgins.

974
01:00:24,288 --> 01:00:27,038
Good night, Aunt Harriet.

975
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:33,010
FONG: Is there anything else, my son?

976
01:00:34,214 --> 01:00:36,554
And one piece of pizza.

977
01:00:39,386 --> 01:00:43,846
Must admit, very unusual
ingredients for medical formula.

978
01:00:44,350 --> 01:00:48,270
However, ways of western
people I not quite understand.

979
01:00:48,354 --> 01:00:50,064
Sounds crazy to me too.

980
01:00:50,105 --> 01:00:52,565
Well, what else
can you expect from this dopey kid?

981
01:00:52,608 --> 01:00:55,488
He's come up with a formula that's
just screwy enough to work.

982
01:00:55,569 --> 01:00:57,359
Come on. Let's get this over to Harry.

983
01:00:57,404 --> 01:00:59,704
That Krinkle cereal guy is waitin' for it.

984
01:01:00,199 --> 01:01:03,369
Now, wait a second, boss.
We gotta take care of the kid here.

985
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:04,910
He can identify us.

986
01:01:05,913 --> 01:01:09,083
Young man will be unable
to identify anyone.

987
01:01:09,124 --> 01:01:12,254
He will remember
only what I tell him to remember,

988
01:01:12,294 --> 01:01:15,014
will do only what I tell him to do.

989
01:01:15,464 --> 01:01:17,724
Good. I trust you, Fong.

990
01:01:17,758 --> 01:01:19,678
See that he gets home
as soon as possible,

991
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,640
and make sure he doesn't
remember anything.

992
01:01:22,096 --> 01:01:24,806
Just give Cookie
and me a minute to get out of here.

993
01:01:31,897 --> 01:01:33,687
My son,

994
01:01:33,774 --> 01:01:37,114
you will awake when I clap my hands.

995
01:01:37,611 --> 01:01:42,201
When you do,
you will remember nothing.

996
01:01:42,282 --> 01:01:45,452
You will not remember
where you have been,

997
01:01:45,494 --> 01:01:47,714
nor what has happened to you.

998
01:01:48,163 --> 01:01:51,793
All you will know
is that your little dog is home,

999
01:01:51,834 --> 01:01:53,884
and he is looking for you.

1000
01:01:54,378 --> 01:01:56,128
He needs you.

1001
01:01:56,213 --> 01:01:59,513
You must hurry to him. He is lonesome.

1002
01:02:00,592 --> 01:02:04,432
You must get home as fast as you can.

1003
01:02:04,471 --> 01:02:08,021
Take the first means
of transportation you see.

1004
01:02:08,225 --> 01:02:09,805
(CROWD CHEERING)

1005
01:02:09,893 --> 01:02:12,603
Thank you.
Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you.

1006
01:02:13,188 --> 01:02:16,728
I'll be very happy
to come down again any time at all, but...

1007
01:02:16,817 --> 01:02:18,987
(LAUGHS) Right now
I'm afraid it's getting a little late.

1008
01:02:19,027 --> 01:02:21,277
I've got to be along back to my office.

1009
01:02:21,321 --> 01:02:24,071
There are many
pressing duties awaiting for me there.

1010
01:02:24,158 --> 01:02:27,198
So, just at the moment
I'll say good night all, or...

1011
01:02:27,286 --> 01:02:30,706
Ah! Better than that, er, uh, "saranola."

1012
01:02:31,081 --> 01:02:32,791
- (CHUCKLING)
- Is that Chinese?

1013
01:02:32,833 --> 01:02:34,673
What? No. Forget it.

1014
01:02:35,252 --> 01:02:36,842
How about just one more picture, chief?

1015
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:38,840
With the official committee,
and your men, of course.

1238
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:57,370
It had an acid taste before.

1239
01:14:57,410 --> 01:15:00,910
But a vitamin formula like mine wouldn't
have an acid taste. That's impossible.

You're right. A vitamin formula
wouldn't, but mine would.

was missing.

got mixed up in the cereal.

It was my formula that
gave it the strength, not the vitamins.

didn't have anything to do with it?

that we don't have the right formula now,
