1
00:03:16,961 --> 00:03:19,429
- Bye, Tracy! Have fun!
- You too. Where you going?

2
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,364
Washington, D.C.
How about you?

3
00:03:21,465 --> 00:03:23,033
Don't know.
Someplace.

4
00:03:23,134 --> 00:03:25,669
- Mom hasn't told us yet.
- I'll send you a card!

5
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,470
bye.

6
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,144
No sign
of mother yet, Tracy?

7
00:03:34,245 --> 00:03:36,914
- She'll be here, Mrs. Hadley.
- Good. Good.

8
00:03:37,015 --> 00:03:40,750
I wouldn't want Easter to be as
disappointing for you as Christmas.

9
00:03:40,852 --> 00:03:43,086
That wasn't mother's fault,
Mrs. Hadley.

10
00:03:43,188 --> 00:03:46,190
She was working in Paris,
and they ran into complications.

11
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:47,891
So I remember.

12
00:03:47,992 --> 00:03:50,393
When a person's
a complete head of a magazine,

13
00:03:50,494 --> 00:03:53,297
A person just can't
ignore complications.

14
00:03:53,397 --> 00:03:54,731
Of course.

15
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:57,901
Speaking of complications,
where's your brother?

16
00:03:58,002 --> 00:04:00,570
- He's at half-mast.
- I see.

17
00:04:00,671 --> 00:04:03,640
- He's where?
- There.

18
00:04:03,741 --> 00:04:05,408
Jay...

19
00:04:05,509 --> 00:04:07,610
What are you doing
up there?

20
00:04:07,712 --> 00:04:09,679
I'm looking for something.

21
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,850
Jay Osborne, come down here
this instant.

22
00:04:12,951 --> 00:04:15,219
I can't. I lost Duster.

23
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,961
never mind.
I found him.

24
00:04:25,529 --> 00:04:28,966
My petunias! Oh!

25
00:04:33,905 --> 00:04:36,340
Jay, it's mother!

26
00:04:41,612 --> 00:04:43,380
Mom.

27
00:04:43,481 --> 00:04:45,415
Miss Murdoch.

28
00:04:45,516 --> 00:04:49,619
- Tracy.
- Where's mom?

29
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,857
There's been a slight change
of plans. In you go, children.

30
00:04:55,126 --> 00:04:56,526
Without that.

31
00:04:56,627 --> 00:04:58,595
Oh, he's my friend.

32
00:04:58,696 --> 00:05:00,730
I never go anywhere
without Duster.

33
00:05:00,831 --> 00:05:05,102
All right, put him
in the basket and get in.

34
00:05:05,203 --> 00:05:07,938
And roll down
all the windows.

35
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:11,775
- Oh, Mrs. Hadley. - Good-bye,
Tracy. Have a happy Easter.

36
00:05:11,876 --> 00:05:14,711
You, too, Mrs. Hadley, and I
have an Easter present for you.

37
00:05:14,812 --> 00:05:18,282
- It's a handkerchief.
- Well, thank you, Tracy.

38
00:05:18,383 --> 00:05:23,287
- And I got a present too.
- Oh, and thank you, Jay.

39
00:05:23,388 --> 00:05:25,422
Aren't you dears?

40
00:05:25,523 --> 00:05:27,490
- Bye.
- Bye.

41
00:05:30,895 --> 00:05:33,496
You didn't give
anything dumb, I hope.

42
00:05:33,597 --> 00:05:37,734
Heck, no. It's one of my most
valuable possessions.

43
00:05:56,087 --> 00:05:59,957
But what happened to mother? I thought
she was supposed to get in last night.

44
00:06:00,058 --> 00:06:04,194
I'm afraid your mother's been detained
in Hong Kong for another two weeks.

45
00:06:04,295 --> 00:06:05,395
Hong Kong?

46
00:06:05,496 --> 00:06:08,565
Two weeks?
That's our whole vacation.

47
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:11,901
Well, naturally, your mother
was terribly disappointed.

48
00:06:12,003 --> 00:06:14,671
This is the third vacation
in a row.

49
00:06:14,772 --> 00:06:17,807
Jay, mom can't help it.
Work is work.

50
00:06:17,908 --> 00:06:21,044
So we spend Easter vacation
at home. That's not so bad.

51
00:06:21,145 --> 00:06:24,281
Not at home, dear.
There won't be anyone there.

52
00:06:24,382 --> 00:06:27,417
You see, it's my vacation, too,
and I'm off to Bermuda.

53
00:06:27,518 --> 00:06:30,653
Bermuda? You're taking us
to Bermuda?

54
00:06:30,754 --> 00:06:32,222
Oh, boy!

55
00:06:44,535 --> 00:06:48,338
<i>TWA flight 802
now boarding at gate three</i>

56
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:50,007
<i>For Chicago and Los Angeles.</i>

57
00:06:50,108 --> 00:06:52,109
I don't understand,
miss Murdoch.

58
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:54,144
What are we doing here?
Seeing you off?

59
00:06:54,245 --> 00:06:55,312
No, I'm seeing you off.

60
00:06:55,413 --> 00:06:57,280
Flight 801 to Los Angeles.

61
00:06:57,382 --> 00:06:58,915
Los Angeles?

62
00:06:59,017 --> 00:07:01,651
We're being shipped
to grandfather Osborne’s again!

63
00:07:01,752 --> 00:07:05,788
Grandfather Osborne’s.
I'd rather go to jail first.

64
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:09,059
- It's only for Easter vacation.
- Some vacation. Yuck.

65
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:27,411
Thank you.
Off you go now.

66
00:07:27,512 --> 00:07:30,180
I'll send you a nice
postcard from Bermuda.

67
00:07:30,281 --> 00:07:31,948
Bermuda?

68
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:35,585
You wouldn't like to
exchange tickets, would you?

69
00:07:35,686 --> 00:07:38,955
Nonsense. I'll bet by the
time you get to Los Angeles...

70
00:07:39,057 --> 00:07:42,526
You'll be as glad to see your
grandfather as he is to see you.

71
00:07:42,626 --> 00:07:45,028
Trapped, Jameson,
like a rat in a cage.

72
00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:48,165
Well, it's only for Easter
vacation, Mr. Osborne.

73
00:07:48,266 --> 00:07:50,567
- And it is an emergency.
- An emergency!

74
00:07:50,668 --> 00:07:52,569
An emergency is an earthquake
or a tornado.

75
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:55,205
My daughter-in-law's children
are a science fiction nightmare.

76
00:07:55,306 --> 00:07:56,706
Oh, please, please.

77
00:07:56,807 --> 00:07:59,376
Be very, very careful with that.
It's worth a fortune.

78
00:07:59,477 --> 00:08:02,512
Perhaps they've matured a bit
since their last visit, sir.

79
00:08:02,613 --> 00:08:04,714
Jameson, when it comes
to Tracy and Jay...

80
00:08:06,884 --> 00:08:09,986
There, there, sir Winston.
There, there.

81
00:08:10,088 --> 00:08:12,722
I intend to leave no piece
of crystal in sight.

82
00:08:12,823 --> 00:08:15,125
No Dresden china unprotected.
Up you go.

83
00:08:15,226 --> 00:08:19,296
but the chandelier.
If I may, sir...

84
00:08:19,397 --> 00:08:21,965
How could the little fellow
possibly reach the chandelier?

85
00:08:22,066 --> 00:08:26,236
The same way he reached it last
year: With a rocket ship. Up.

86
00:08:28,172 --> 00:08:31,908
The launch was perfect, till
that chandelier got in the way.

87
00:08:32,009 --> 00:08:35,612
And grandfather didn't have to step
on my rocket ship and crunch it.

88
00:08:35,713 --> 00:08:38,281
He just doesn't
understand kids, Jay.

89
00:08:38,382 --> 00:08:40,883
I mean, it's been so long
since he's had any.

90
00:08:40,985 --> 00:08:43,153
He had us last Summer.

91
00:08:43,254 --> 00:08:46,123
I tried, Tracy.
I really did.

92
00:08:46,224 --> 00:08:48,091
I even hid my skateboard
in the closet,

93
00:08:48,192 --> 00:08:50,260
So he wouldn't hurt himself.

94
00:08:50,361 --> 00:08:52,929
How did I know it was the
stairway to the wine cellar?

95
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:56,633
Airborne, Jameson. That
skateboard was like a b-29.

96
00:08:56,734 --> 00:09:01,204
Straight down the stairs. Decimated
a whole case of muto rostio, 1908.

97
00:09:01,305 --> 00:09:05,175
Yes, a lovely year, 1908.
Let me see, sir.

98
00:09:05,276 --> 00:09:08,811
Was that before or after the
errant billiard ball episode?

99
00:09:08,912 --> 00:09:12,915
- After, but before the bow and arrow incident.
- Oh, yes, yes.

100
00:09:13,017 --> 00:09:16,520
I believe we still have that large
foam rubber cushion, if needed.

101
00:09:16,621 --> 00:09:20,557
Good. And let's make sure Dr.
Butterworth's number is handy at all times.

102
00:09:20,658 --> 00:09:24,060
Excuse me, Mr. Osborne. Any
place special for the golf clubs?

103
00:09:24,162 --> 00:09:25,928
Oh, yes.
Hide 'em in the attic.

104
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:29,466
Oh, good heavens. Only three
more hours to countdown.

105
00:09:29,567 --> 00:09:33,703
Three hours
till doomsday.

106
00:09:33,804 --> 00:09:35,772
Do you think
she's really upset?

107
00:09:35,873 --> 00:09:37,774
Do I think
who's really upset?

108
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:40,510
Well, mother, about not
spending Easter with us.

109
00:09:40,611 --> 00:09:42,479
Of course.
She just can't pick up

110
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,381
In the middle
of her work and leave.

111
00:09:44,482 --> 00:09:46,249
I'll bet she wants
to be with us

112
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:48,652
Just as much as we
wanna be with her.

113
00:09:48,752 --> 00:09:50,487
Do you think so?

114
00:09:50,588 --> 00:09:54,457
Sure. I'll bet you
mom wants to...

115
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:58,928
Jay, suppose we didn't go
to grandfather's.

116
00:09:59,029 --> 00:10:00,597
Huh?

117
00:10:03,234 --> 00:10:04,334
Look out!

118
00:10:11,576 --> 00:10:13,843
Sorry, sir.
A near miss.

119
00:10:13,944 --> 00:10:17,113
Bert, Bert, will you please be careful.

120
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:20,116
All we need is an accident here,
and we're gonna blow the whole caper.

121
00:10:20,218 --> 00:10:24,187
I missed him, Duke. Ain't that
the main thing, missing him?

122
00:10:27,024 --> 00:10:29,693
Yeah, that's the main thing,
all right, Bert. Yeah.

123
00:10:31,195 --> 00:10:34,264
No harm, no foul! It's
okay. Go ahead. Go ahead.

124
00:10:37,468 --> 00:10:40,537
Better he tests them anyway.

125
00:10:47,845 --> 00:10:50,947
Bert, how long are we gonna
follow that truck so closely?

126
00:10:51,048 --> 00:10:54,183
Uh, just while our bumpers
are stuck together.

127
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,754
I'll handle it.

128
00:11:10,301 --> 00:11:12,569
- I'm sorry, Duke.
- It's all right.

129
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:15,505
I guess I'm a little nervous.
Would you believe it?

130
00:11:15,606 --> 00:11:19,709
I got the whole thing: Sweaty
palms, butterflies in the stomach.

131
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:22,245
Maybe it's the airport.
You know me and flying.

132
00:11:22,346 --> 00:11:25,114
Bert, w-w-will you
just relax.

133
00:11:25,215 --> 00:11:27,550
Yeah, right.

134
00:11:27,652 --> 00:11:30,086
After all, we're not
goin' up in any airplane.

135
00:11:30,187 --> 00:11:32,088
We're just knockin' over
a safe.

136
00:11:51,475 --> 00:11:54,277
You just worry about the safe
and leave everything else to me.

137
00:11:54,378 --> 00:11:56,446
- Everything's gonna go just great.
- Yeah.

138
00:11:56,547 --> 00:11:59,683
<i>the white zone is for
immediate loading and unloading</i>

139
00:11:59,784 --> 00:12:02,885
<i>Of passengers only.
No parking.</i>

140
00:12:05,523 --> 00:12:08,124
okay. If we go
direct to Honolulu...

141
00:12:08,225 --> 00:12:10,092
And then to Guam,

142
00:12:10,194 --> 00:12:12,329
In 14 hours,
we can be in Hong Kong.

143
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:14,364
- With mother!
- Right.

144
00:12:14,465 --> 00:12:18,435
If she can't bring her vacation
to us, we'll bring ours to her.

145
00:12:18,536 --> 00:12:20,570
Boy, you got it all
figured out.

146
00:12:20,671 --> 00:12:23,239
- Except for one small thing.
- What?

147
00:12:23,341 --> 00:12:27,711
Where do we get the $1,200 to
pay for the two plane tickets?

148
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:02,645
How about credit cards?
Everybody uses credit cards.

149
00:13:02,747 --> 00:13:04,647
Jay, we don't have
any credit cards.

150
00:13:04,749 --> 00:13:07,484
Okay. Well, then, let's just
write a check at the bank.

151
00:13:07,585 --> 00:13:09,118
Like mother always does.

152
00:13:09,219 --> 00:13:11,688
Jay, you have to have money
in the bank to begin with.

153
00:13:11,789 --> 00:13:16,626
Well, if you don't take any of my
suggestions, we'll never get to Hong Kong.

154
00:13:27,971 --> 00:13:31,274
- Two pieces, eight inches long.
- Okay.

155
00:13:33,411 --> 00:13:37,113
Last time out, you cracked one of
these in less than seven minutes.

156
00:13:37,214 --> 00:13:39,348
Remember, Duke?

157
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,684
Guy gets a little Rusty
after five years.

158
00:13:41,786 --> 00:13:46,088
Oh, no. Not you, Duke.
You were the best.

159
00:13:46,189 --> 00:13:49,091
Also the unluckiest.

160
00:13:49,192 --> 00:13:53,129
One thing though:
We never got caught.

161
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:55,097
We also never got anything.

162
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:57,767
Every safe we opened up either
contained nonnegotiable bonds,

163
00:13:57,868 --> 00:13:59,936
Last year's lottery tickets
or the mouse trap.

164
00:14:00,037 --> 00:14:01,938
Remember the mouse trap?

165
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:06,876
It was either a case of
going straight or going broke.

166
00:14:06,977 --> 00:14:08,645
Don't think
about it now, Duke.

167
00:14:08,746 --> 00:14:12,682
Just concentrate on why
we're going crooked again.

168
00:14:14,418 --> 00:14:18,220
The time has come, Jameson.
Go in. Pick up the children.

169
00:14:18,322 --> 00:14:19,422
Me, sir?

170
00:14:19,523 --> 00:14:21,724
- Of course.
- Unarmed?

171
00:14:21,826 --> 00:14:24,661
Armed with the knowledge that the
raise I have been promising you...

172
00:14:24,762 --> 00:14:26,696
Will be forthcoming
in your next paycheck.

173
00:14:26,797 --> 00:14:28,798
Oh, that isn't necessary, sir.

174
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:31,468
Though it does make the task
a bit easier.

175
00:14:31,569 --> 00:14:35,371
<i>be sure to check for valuables
before leaving the plane.</i>

176
00:14:37,475 --> 00:14:39,509
Duster. Duster.

177
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,310
Duster.

178
00:14:41,411 --> 00:14:44,814
- What's the matter?
- Duster's gone.

179
00:14:44,915 --> 00:14:47,617
Duster.

180
00:14:47,718 --> 00:14:50,620
Has anybody seen a skunk?

181
00:14:50,721 --> 00:14:55,792
Excuse me? Which gate will
flight 801 arrive at?

182
00:14:55,893 --> 00:14:58,294
801? That prob...

183
00:15:06,604 --> 00:15:08,437
get him away from me!

184
00:15:08,506 --> 00:15:10,172
Security!

185
00:15:10,273 --> 00:15:13,442
run! Skunk! Skunk!

186
00:15:14,612 --> 00:15:17,380
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

187
00:15:30,694 --> 00:15:33,229
- What happened?
- There were two of 'em and a skunk.

188
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:36,833
- Two of what and a skunk?
- Which way did they go?

189
00:15:42,239 --> 00:15:46,208
We hit it. We hit it, Duke.
It's the garage free and clear.

190
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,480
What's that mean?

191
00:15:51,582 --> 00:15:53,716
It means we just
went straight again.

192
00:15:53,817 --> 00:15:56,553
Fill that bucket up
with everything you can.

193
00:15:59,757 --> 00:16:01,624
I locked it.

194
00:16:01,725 --> 00:16:04,293
You locked it.

195
00:16:04,394 --> 00:16:07,630
Let's get out of here.
Leave it.

196
00:16:16,173 --> 00:16:19,576
okay, nice and easy,
like we're tourists.

197
00:16:22,646 --> 00:16:27,183
Hey. What were you
doing in there?

198
00:16:30,888 --> 00:16:32,789
I don't know
how we lost 'em.

199
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:35,625
How'd that little skunk get
on board in the first place?

200
00:16:35,726 --> 00:16:37,827
He got on board
with his sister.

201
00:16:37,928 --> 00:16:40,496
Oh. Oh,
you mean the pet.

202
00:16:40,598 --> 00:16:46,069
Now, if I were miss Tracy,
how would I get out of here?

203
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:55,511
Ah.

204
00:17:14,197 --> 00:17:16,699
<i>the white zone
is for immediate loading</i>

205
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,301
<i>And unloading
of passengers only.</i>

206
00:17:19,402 --> 00:17:22,972
<i>No parking.
Violators will be towed away.</i>

207
00:17:27,511 --> 00:17:31,313
- What are we gonna do?
- Hide Duster.

208
00:17:47,297 --> 00:17:49,832
take off, driver!

209
00:17:49,933 --> 00:17:51,701
This cab is taken.

210
00:17:51,802 --> 00:17:54,971
Of course, it's taken.
We're taking it.

211
00:17:58,341 --> 00:18:01,577
I'm afraid we've lost them,
Mr. Osborne.

212
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,379
I'm afraid we haven't.

213
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,682
Peter, follow that cab.

214
00:18:08,786 --> 00:18:11,654
I wonder
what they're up to.

215
00:18:11,755 --> 00:18:14,323
- Where do you think you kids are goin'?
- We're running away.

216
00:18:14,424 --> 00:18:18,061
Running away, huh?

217
00:18:19,362 --> 00:18:21,931
Yes, just like you are.

218
00:18:22,032 --> 00:18:25,301
Just a minute there, young lady.
Who says we're running away?

219
00:18:25,402 --> 00:18:27,303
Betcha they would.

220
00:18:27,404 --> 00:18:30,940
- They'd be pretty interested in these burglar tools.
- Burglar tools!

221
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:33,843
- I believe this is what is known as a Jimmy.
- Give me that.

222
00:18:33,944 --> 00:18:35,978
- This is a pick for locks.
- Put that away.

223
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,547
Boy, a couple of real crooks.
What'd you get?

224
00:18:38,648 --> 00:18:42,819
- So far, just a couple of kids.
- And a skunk. A skunk!

225
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,386
It's just a pet.

226
00:18:44,487 --> 00:18:47,456
Well, you and your pet better
get yourselves another ride.

227
00:18:47,557 --> 00:18:49,959
okay.

228
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:53,596
Driver, would you please turn
around and stop that police car?

229
00:18:53,697 --> 00:18:56,933
Just keep going ahead,
driver.

230
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,374
sergeant turner?

231
00:19:05,475 --> 00:19:08,577
- What happened?
- They were after the safe in the treasurer's office.

232
00:19:08,678 --> 00:19:12,115
Cleaning lady said they had it
open, but it wasn't blown or forced.

233
00:19:12,216 --> 00:19:14,717
Just a little adhesive tape
stuck to the door.

234
00:19:14,818 --> 00:19:17,720
- Adhesive tape. About this far from the dial?
- Yes, sir.

235
00:19:17,821 --> 00:19:21,390
- Recognize the MO, sir?
- A guy I've been tryin' to nail for years.

236
00:19:21,491 --> 00:19:23,459
- How much did he get?
- Apparently nothing.

237
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,862
- That's my man. He never did.
- I had a case like that...

238
00:19:25,963 --> 00:19:28,364
In my socio-psychology course
at the academy.

239
00:19:28,465 --> 00:19:30,532
- Oh, Longnecker...
- It's the sadomasochistic personality at work.

240
00:19:30,634 --> 00:19:33,202
- Longnecker.
- This man is part of the compulsive loser syndrome.

241
00:19:33,303 --> 00:19:35,638
Longnecker, this guy was not
a loser. He was just unlucky.

242
00:19:35,739 --> 00:19:39,441
Until he disappeared
five years ago, he was the best.

243
00:19:39,542 --> 00:19:43,345
And if he's back in business, we'd
better get lucky before he does.

244
00:19:51,221 --> 00:19:54,523
You can drop us
right, uh, here.

245
00:20:03,066 --> 00:20:06,368
Well, kids, this is
where we say good-bye.

246
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:10,506
- Is this your hideout?
- Will you please...

247
00:20:10,607 --> 00:20:12,942
- Pay the driver, Bert.
- Oh, sure, Duke. Oh, Duke.

248
00:20:13,043 --> 00:20:16,078
You haven't got any loose
change on ya, have ya?

249
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:18,080
You didn't bring
any money with you?

250
00:20:18,182 --> 00:20:20,116
Well, we had the car
when we left home.

251
00:20:20,217 --> 00:20:22,384
- I thought we'd be loaded now.
- How are we gonna pay?

252
00:20:22,485 --> 00:20:24,020
Keep the change, driver.

253
00:20:29,793 --> 00:20:32,728
- Why aren't you in that cab?
- We can use a hideout too.

254
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,697
No, no.
No Chance. No.

255
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:38,467
If you're runnin' away that means
somebody's gonna come lookin' for you.

256
00:20:38,568 --> 00:20:40,903
We've got enough troubles.
Get out of here. Scat.

257
00:20:41,004 --> 00:20:44,207
- Scat.
- Okay. Okay.

258
00:20:45,608 --> 00:20:48,044
- Come on, Jay.
- Where we goin'?

259
00:20:48,145 --> 00:20:52,748
Oh, I don't know. Maybe there's
a park that we can sleep in.

260
00:20:54,751 --> 00:20:57,386
- what's the matter?
- Oh, nothing.

261
00:20:57,487 --> 00:21:00,189
- It's just my asthma.
- Asthma?

262
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:05,161
You know I always get it when it's
cold and damp and late at night,

263
00:21:05,262 --> 00:21:07,897
And I have to sleep outdoors.

264
00:21:07,998 --> 00:21:10,699
But I'll be all right.

265
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:15,304
Let's get some of these
newspapers out of the trash can.

266
00:21:15,405 --> 00:21:18,507
what for?

267
00:21:18,608 --> 00:21:22,078
To stuff inside of our
clothing, so we don't freeze.

268
00:21:45,402 --> 00:21:48,938
Just... One... Night.

269
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,022
Shall I retrieve them, sir?

270
00:22:06,123 --> 00:22:08,457
there might be
one alternative.

271
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:11,928
On the other hand, would you say
the children are in imminent danger?

272
00:22:12,029 --> 00:22:14,230
No, sir.

273
00:22:14,331 --> 00:22:16,933
And might not a look
on the seamier side of life

274
00:22:17,034 --> 00:22:21,137
Help them to show more respect
for the finer things?

275
00:22:21,238 --> 00:22:23,105
Oh, I believe
it would, sir.

276
00:22:23,206 --> 00:22:25,341
If we leave Peter behind
to keep an eye on them,

277
00:22:25,442 --> 00:22:27,944
Might this be the tonic
to straighten those children up,

278
00:22:28,045 --> 00:22:30,679
Make them into
better citizens?

279
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,681
Indeed, it might, sir.

280
00:22:32,782 --> 00:22:34,417
That's very astute
of you, Jameson.

281
00:22:34,517 --> 00:22:37,186
You can expect a bonus
along with your raise.

282
00:22:40,523 --> 00:22:42,658
I got the keys.

283
00:22:44,061 --> 00:22:46,628
Five grand, Duke.
Where we gonna get five grand?

284
00:22:46,729 --> 00:22:49,531
We'll get it. We'll get
it. Now just don't panic.

285
00:22:49,632 --> 00:22:52,134
Yeah, right. Gotcha.
Don't panic.

286
00:22:52,235 --> 00:22:55,271
After all, we're just small
potatoes to a guy like big Joe.

287
00:22:55,372 --> 00:22:56,738
He deals with millions.

288
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:00,242
He probably forgot
all about us.

289
00:23:00,344 --> 00:23:02,144
Then again,
he probably remembered.

290
00:23:02,245 --> 00:23:05,247
Would you believe
the door was open, Duke?

291
00:23:05,349 --> 00:23:07,549
We knew that you would want us
to make ourselves comfortable.

292
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:11,320
Oh, sure, make yourselves
comfortable. You already have.

293
00:23:15,225 --> 00:23:18,060
Freddie.

294
00:23:18,161 --> 00:23:21,330
Hello, kids.
Hello, "puddy cat. "

295
00:23:21,431 --> 00:23:25,001
I didn't know you were
a family man, Duke.

296
00:23:25,102 --> 00:23:27,536
Oh, yes, yes, of course,
yes. This is my niece.

297
00:23:27,637 --> 00:23:30,373
And, um... My niece and
nephew from, uh, buffalo.

298
00:23:30,474 --> 00:23:32,441
- Buffalo.
- Buffalo!

299
00:23:32,542 --> 00:23:34,176
That's near Syracuse.

300
00:23:34,277 --> 00:23:37,079
Bert, why don't you see if we can
get some pajamas for the kids...

301
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:40,516
- And tuck 'em in to their
little beddy-by. - Oh, sure, sure.

302
00:23:41,684 --> 00:23:43,852
Psst.

303
00:23:46,089 --> 00:23:48,024
Grapevine tells me that, uh,

304
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:50,692
You were at the airport
tonight, Duke.

305
00:23:50,793 --> 00:23:52,895
Yeah, but it's
my usual luck, Joe.

306
00:23:52,996 --> 00:23:54,897
See? Nothing. Nothing.

307
00:23:54,998 --> 00:23:57,400
Oh, that's too bad.

308
00:23:57,501 --> 00:24:00,336
The computer's gonna be
very unhappy to hear that.

309
00:24:00,437 --> 00:24:01,437
Computer?

310
00:24:01,538 --> 00:24:05,007
Yeah, that note is...
Way overdue.

311
00:24:05,108 --> 00:24:06,808
And it's a sizable amount.

312
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:09,711
Well, it was $5,000
the last time I looked.

313
00:24:09,812 --> 00:24:12,348
You haven't looked
in a long time, Duke.

314
00:24:12,449 --> 00:24:16,252
And you know those computers.
Clickety-click, clickety-click.

315
00:24:16,353 --> 00:24:21,223
<i>Interest, carryin' charges. Interest
on carryin' charges. Clickety-click.</i>

316
00:24:21,324 --> 00:24:24,793
Well, just how much has it
clickety-clicked up to?

317
00:24:24,894 --> 00:24:26,762
Nine big ones.

318
00:24:26,863 --> 00:24:28,830
N- nine...
Nine thousand dollars?

319
00:24:28,932 --> 00:24:32,935
Every minute we spend talkin',
it's clickety-click clickety-click.

320
00:24:33,036 --> 00:24:36,372
Isn't there some way
we could get an extension?

321
00:24:36,473 --> 00:24:40,142
- An extension?
- An extension.

322
00:24:40,243 --> 00:24:43,112
I mean, the garage
can make it.

323
00:24:43,213 --> 00:24:45,414
We were just starting
to roll...

324
00:24:45,515 --> 00:24:48,684
When they tore up the streets
out here and blocked it off.

325
00:24:48,785 --> 00:24:50,919
Started to build high rises
on each side of us.

326
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:54,290
Isn't it a shame?
Isn't it a shame, Freddie?

327
00:24:54,391 --> 00:24:57,726
It's a shame, but I can't
tell that to the computer.

328
00:24:57,827 --> 00:25:00,429
Me, I'm a pushover,
but the computer...

329
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:04,766
If people don't pay their debts,
that computer goes to pieces.

330
00:25:04,867 --> 00:25:06,969
Stick around, shadow.

331
00:25:09,106 --> 00:25:12,874
Come here. I think you might
be interested in this too.

332
00:25:12,976 --> 00:25:15,311
Me? No, I'm just
the wheel man.

333
00:25:15,412 --> 00:25:18,347
I just do the driving.
I'm not even very good at that.

334
00:25:18,448 --> 00:25:21,650
Duke just keeps me around
because I'm his ex-brother-in-law.

335
00:25:21,751 --> 00:25:24,253
See, I was married
to his sister Irene.

336
00:25:24,354 --> 00:25:27,389
We never got along though.
I got along better with Duke.

337
00:25:27,491 --> 00:25:29,492
Guess that's why
he keeps me around.

338
00:25:29,593 --> 00:25:31,793
guess that's why
he let you sign this note too.

339
00:25:31,894 --> 00:25:35,697
You're buddies, huh? That
is your name, isn't it?

340
00:25:35,798 --> 00:25:37,699
Bert Delaney?

341
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,735
Well, now, I'm not sure
if it's exactly that.

342
00:25:39,836 --> 00:25:41,737
I'd have to check
my birth certificate.

343
00:25:41,838 --> 00:25:43,405
That's in Hackensack,
new jersey.

344
00:25:43,507 --> 00:25:45,874
I was born in Hackensack.
Whole family was.

345
00:25:45,975 --> 00:25:48,477
Mom and the kids.

346
00:25:48,578 --> 00:25:50,679
Bet you'd love to see
your mom again.

347
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:55,451
Oh, well, poor mom.
You see, she's up in, uh...

348
00:25:55,552 --> 00:25:58,920
Oh. That... That's what
you meant, huh? Yeah, well.

349
00:26:02,592 --> 00:26:04,660
72 hours, Duke.

350
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:11,233
And I hope you don't
disappoint the computer.

351
00:26:18,708 --> 00:26:22,645
How do you suppose he did that with
just a little stub of the pencil?

352
00:26:24,047 --> 00:26:29,185
I'm wonderin' how we're gonna
get $9,000 in the next 72 hours.

353
00:26:31,221 --> 00:26:33,556
Did you hear what big Joe
said to Duke?

354
00:26:33,657 --> 00:26:35,691
All I heard
was pencils cracking.

355
00:26:35,792 --> 00:26:38,160
Boy, Duke and Bert
are in trouble.

356
00:26:38,261 --> 00:26:41,897
Yeah. This is
some cheesy hideout.

357
00:26:41,998 --> 00:26:44,733
Two guys can just walk in
and shove 'em around like that.

358
00:26:44,834 --> 00:26:48,036
Boy, if this was my hideout,
I'd make a few changes.

359
00:26:48,137 --> 00:26:51,207
They need more than that.
They need money.

360
00:26:51,308 --> 00:26:54,510
- Even more money than we need.
- How're they gonna get it?

361
00:26:54,611 --> 00:26:59,715
Well, I think I have an idea
of how we can all get it.

362
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:11,993
Duster. Duster.

363
00:27:17,267 --> 00:27:19,335
Duster.

364
00:27:32,382 --> 00:27:35,651
- What do you want, kid?
- It's Duster. I lost him.

365
00:27:35,752 --> 00:27:39,555
Oh, yeah?
I'm sorry.

366
00:27:50,367 --> 00:27:52,434
I found him.

367
00:27:54,571 --> 00:27:57,172
- Thank you.
- Mmm.

368
00:28:08,818 --> 00:28:10,519
Bacon?

369
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:13,589
Uh-uh. That's
gotta be waffles.

370
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:15,624
And do I know waffles.

371
00:28:15,725 --> 00:28:18,126
When I was married to Irene,
your sister,

372
00:28:18,227 --> 00:28:20,596
She drove me bananas
with her waffles.

373
00:28:20,697 --> 00:28:22,831
- Morning.
- What's this?

374
00:28:22,932 --> 00:28:25,768
Breakfast. I hope you like
scrambled eggs and bacon.

375
00:28:25,868 --> 00:28:28,671
Oh, it's better
than waffles and Irene.

376
00:28:28,772 --> 00:28:31,373
- Some surprise, huh, Duke?
- Not to me, it isn't.

377
00:28:31,474 --> 00:28:33,909
Now I said one night.

378
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:36,878
If you think this meal is gonna
buy you some extra time, young lady,

379
00:28:36,979 --> 00:28:39,815
- You're very much mistaken.
- Oh, no.

380
00:28:39,916 --> 00:28:42,117
Breakfast is just because
I like to cook.

381
00:28:42,218 --> 00:28:44,252
- And I like to eat.
- And so do I.

382
00:28:44,354 --> 00:28:46,522
Wait a minute.
Wait just one minute here.

383
00:28:46,623 --> 00:28:49,191
- We didn't have bacon and eggs in the house.
- You're quite right.

384
00:28:49,292 --> 00:28:52,761
- I bought them the second time I went out.
- The second time?

385
00:28:52,862 --> 00:28:56,565
Well, the first time I went out
last night, the market wasn't open,

386
00:28:56,666 --> 00:28:59,234
So I just mailed the
ransom note to grandfather.

387
00:29:00,704 --> 00:29:03,772
- You did what?
- Ransom note to grandfather?

388
00:29:03,873 --> 00:29:05,874
For $100,000.

389
00:29:05,975 --> 00:29:09,211
I told him to leave it under the
umbrella tree in Williams garden.

390
00:29:09,312 --> 00:29:12,214
- You... Hold it. Hold it.
- Don't worry. He can spare it.

391
00:29:12,315 --> 00:29:14,082
Yeah, he's got millions
and billions.

392
00:29:14,183 --> 00:29:17,953
- Hold it!
- All we need is enough for two tickets to Hong Kong.

393
00:29:18,054 --> 00:29:20,389
- You can have the rest.
- Just hold it!

394
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:23,325
The squeeze may be on, but
it's not enough to turn me...

395
00:29:23,426 --> 00:29:26,228
From being a safecracker
into a kidnapper.

396
00:29:26,329 --> 00:29:30,165
- Never enough for that.
- But you didn't kidnap us. We kidnapped ourselves.

397
00:29:30,266 --> 00:29:32,334
- Oh, don't be ridiculous.
- Yeah.

398
00:29:32,435 --> 00:29:34,536
Although come to think
of it, they did.

399
00:29:34,637 --> 00:29:36,438
And you didn't send
the ransom note. We did.

400
00:29:36,539 --> 00:29:39,475
- She's got a point there too.
- All you've gotta do is pick up the money.

401
00:29:39,576 --> 00:29:41,443
- That sounds simple enough.
- Simple?

402
00:29:41,544 --> 00:29:44,646
Have you lost your marbles? Do you
know what the rap is for kidnapping?

403
00:29:44,748 --> 00:29:46,515
He's right, Tracy.

404
00:29:46,616 --> 00:29:50,719
Do you know what the rap is
for not paying big Joe $9,000?

405
00:29:51,788 --> 00:29:52,888
She's right, Duke.

406
00:29:52,989 --> 00:29:55,391
I'd rather lose my marbles
than be a broken pencil.

407
00:29:55,492 --> 00:29:57,393
Oh, you would.

408
00:29:57,494 --> 00:29:59,728
- Don't you believe in fate?
- Fate?

409
00:29:59,829 --> 00:30:03,599
- It was fate that put us in that taxi cab with you.
- I thought it was you, Tracy.

410
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:07,369
Maybe it was fate, Duke. I mean,
it'd be criminal to go against fate.

411
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:10,105
- The money would help us all.
- Of course, it will.

412
00:30:10,206 --> 00:30:14,075
Come on, Duke. Be a
good Guy and kidnap us.

413
00:30:17,013 --> 00:30:19,415
- Good day, Jameson.
- Good day, sir.

414
00:30:19,516 --> 00:30:22,117
Good day, sir Winston.

415
00:30:22,218 --> 00:30:24,953
After your breakfast, sir,
shall I bring the car around

416
00:30:25,054 --> 00:30:27,823
To pick up miss Tracy
and master James?

417
00:30:30,894 --> 00:30:33,061
There, there,
sir Winston.

418
00:30:33,162 --> 00:30:36,164
You have a knack for ruining
a perfectly beautiful morning.

419
00:30:36,265 --> 00:30:39,134
Sorry, sir. Will you have
sausages or bacon with your eggs?

420
00:30:39,235 --> 00:30:41,069
Neither, thank you.
I've lost my appetite.

421
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:43,639
- Yes, I quite understand.
- What's this?

422
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:47,743
Well, it arrived early this
morning, sir. Special delivery.

423
00:30:52,849 --> 00:30:56,351
Osborne residence. Oh,
yes, Peter. Just a moment.

424
00:30:57,219 --> 00:30:59,755
It's Peter, sir.

425
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:03,625
Morning, Peter.
Hmm?

426
00:31:04,894 --> 00:31:08,530
She went to the...
Went to the mailbox?

427
00:31:08,631 --> 00:31:10,699
I can't imagine.

428
00:31:12,301 --> 00:31:15,370
On the other hand, maybe I can.
I'll be right back to you, Peter.

429
00:31:15,472 --> 00:31:19,407
Very, uh, interesting development
here. We have a ransom note.

430
00:31:19,509 --> 00:31:21,810
Ransom note?

431
00:31:21,911 --> 00:31:26,882
Yes. "have children.
Leave $100,000. Briefcase.

432
00:31:26,983 --> 00:31:29,952
"under umbrella tree,
Williams gardens, 4:00.

433
00:31:30,052 --> 00:31:31,252
"we mean business. "

434
00:31:31,354 --> 00:31:35,524
$100,000. Good heavens, sir.
Shall I ring up the bank?

435
00:31:35,625 --> 00:31:36,892
You miss the point.

436
00:31:36,993 --> 00:31:39,260
Our little Tracy
concocted this nonsense.

437
00:31:39,362 --> 00:31:41,129
She's conned these poor
benighted gentlemen

438
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:43,131
Into going along
with her idiot plan.

439
00:31:43,232 --> 00:31:45,133
I beg your pardon?

440
00:31:45,234 --> 00:31:47,002
Oh, excuse me, sir.

441
00:31:47,103 --> 00:31:49,137
If I may, sir.
What is our next move?

442
00:31:49,238 --> 00:31:52,574
Next move? Well, as the children
appear to be in no danger whatever,

443
00:31:52,675 --> 00:31:54,943
- I shall first finish my breakfast.
- Oh.

444
00:31:55,044 --> 00:31:58,213
Then we will take additional supplies
to Peter for his prolonged vigil,

445
00:31:58,314 --> 00:32:00,415
After which I will have
a nice round of golf.

446
00:32:00,517 --> 00:32:05,387
- Sounds delightful, sir.
- Also, I'll have bacon and sausage with my eggs.

447
00:32:05,488 --> 00:32:09,090
- Your appetite's returned, sir.
- Quite.

448
00:33:01,778 --> 00:33:03,845
What time you got?

449
00:33:04,914 --> 00:33:07,382
I just told you the time
five minutes ago.

450
00:33:07,483 --> 00:33:12,253
Oh, right, yeah. It was five to 12:00
then, so that'd make it 12:00 now.

451
00:33:12,354 --> 00:33:14,690
So in four hours,
we pick up the money.

452
00:33:19,195 --> 00:33:21,930
Will you please either
drink that or put it down?

453
00:33:22,031 --> 00:33:25,366
Oh, yeah.
I'm sorry, Duke.

454
00:33:25,468 --> 00:33:29,705
Irene always used to make a cup of
hot chocolate to steady the nerves.

455
00:33:29,806 --> 00:33:31,607
She never gave me any though.

456
00:33:31,708 --> 00:33:33,709
they're here! It's the cops!

457
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:37,345
It's fire engines,
and they're passing by.

458
00:33:40,917 --> 00:33:45,186
yeah, right. I always
get that backwards.

459
00:33:45,287 --> 00:33:48,123
See, back in jersey,
when you hear a...

460
00:33:50,292 --> 00:33:52,160
It's usually a police car.

461
00:33:52,261 --> 00:33:55,030
But if it's a...

462
00:33:55,131 --> 00:33:56,898
It's probably an ambulance.

463
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,333
But a fire engine can go...

464
00:34:01,704 --> 00:34:03,705
Or ding-ding-ding-ding,
ding-ding-ding.

465
00:34:03,806 --> 00:34:05,807
Personally,
I'd rather hear the...

466
00:34:07,677 --> 00:34:09,044
Because that...

467
00:34:09,145 --> 00:34:11,279
ding-ding-ding-ding...

468
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:13,782
Boy, that'll
drive you crazy.

469
00:34:16,385 --> 00:34:18,820
I'm sorry, Duke. I guess
I'm just a little edgy.

470
00:34:18,921 --> 00:34:21,389
You think
we can pull this off?

471
00:34:22,458 --> 00:34:24,126
Who knows?

472
00:34:24,226 --> 00:34:27,295
Maybe. If you can
keep the kids hidden,

473
00:34:27,396 --> 00:34:29,898
And, uh, quiet till 4:00.

474
00:34:29,999 --> 00:34:33,535
Oh. That shouldn't be
too hard.

475
00:34:33,636 --> 00:34:35,003
Where are they?

476
00:34:35,104 --> 00:34:37,572
Well, the girl, Tracy,
she's in the bedroom.

477
00:34:37,674 --> 00:34:40,308
- And the boy?
- Jay?

478
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:42,778
Jay!

479
00:34:44,446 --> 00:34:45,847
Check on Jay, too, Duke.

480
00:34:45,948 --> 00:34:48,717
He just walked by
outside the window.

481
00:34:48,818 --> 00:34:50,986
Outside the window!

482
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:56,357
Jay Osborne,
come back here!

483
00:34:56,458 --> 00:35:00,295
Go get him. Go on. I'll
go downstairs. Go get him.

484
00:35:01,964 --> 00:35:04,032
Duster, come back.

485
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:18,513
Here, Duster.
Come on, Duster.

486
00:35:18,614 --> 00:35:20,415
Jay. Now, Jay...

487
00:35:20,516 --> 00:35:23,819
Duster, come back.

488
00:35:25,354 --> 00:35:26,254
Jay, now you be careful.

489
00:35:26,355 --> 00:35:29,524
You hear me, Jay?

490
00:35:32,328 --> 00:35:34,996
oh.

491
00:36:03,659 --> 00:36:07,129
You masher! I'll teach you
to look in my window!

492
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:09,564
- I'm sorry, lady.
- Heel!

493
00:36:16,605 --> 00:36:20,075
What are you doing
down here? Get up there!

494
00:36:21,677 --> 00:36:26,347
stop it! Will you stop that!

495
00:36:42,731 --> 00:36:45,366
Be careful, Bert!

496
00:36:49,972 --> 00:36:51,539
no!

497
00:37:02,551 --> 00:37:04,419
Duster,
you come down here.

498
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,856
What are you doing
up there, Jay?

499
00:37:07,957 --> 00:37:09,858
Duster!

500
00:37:09,959 --> 00:37:13,761
Duster. Duster.

501
00:37:18,467 --> 00:37:20,302
How'd he get up there?

502
00:37:20,402 --> 00:37:24,505
I don't know.
Duster!

503
00:37:32,315 --> 00:37:34,482
Here, Duster.

504
00:37:39,588 --> 00:37:40,755
Duster!

505
00:37:43,659 --> 00:37:45,126
Get back here!

506
00:37:50,166 --> 00:37:52,234
Duster!

507
00:37:54,136 --> 00:37:56,872
Duster,
you get back here!

508
00:37:58,341 --> 00:38:00,242
Where do you think
you're going?

509
00:38:00,343 --> 00:38:02,744
- I gotta go get Duster.
- Get back.

510
00:38:10,386 --> 00:38:12,120
Come on, Duster.

511
00:38:12,221 --> 00:38:14,622
come on. Nice skunk.

512
00:38:14,723 --> 00:38:16,791
Come on.

513
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,961
Duster, come here!

514
00:38:20,062 --> 00:38:21,729
Well, go get him!

515
00:38:30,973 --> 00:38:33,408
- No!
- No, Bert! No! Get back!

516
00:38:33,509 --> 00:38:36,644
Hold on, Duster.

517
00:38:38,747 --> 00:38:40,916
Get a...
Get a canvas!

518
00:38:41,017 --> 00:38:43,718
Anything! A gunny sack!
A potato bag!

519
00:38:43,819 --> 00:38:47,122
hold on, Duster.
He's comin' out to get ya.

520
00:38:48,357 --> 00:38:50,926
- Be careful.
- What?

521
00:38:54,797 --> 00:38:58,900
Get it in here!
All right, stretch it tight.

522
00:39:04,273 --> 00:39:06,874
Get it out! Stretch it
tight! Stretch it tighter!

523
00:39:06,976 --> 00:39:09,044
This way!

524
00:39:12,181 --> 00:39:14,816
Ah! Ah, ah.

525
00:39:19,455 --> 00:39:20,922
Now hold on!

526
00:39:25,127 --> 00:39:27,628
here! Grab my wrist.

527
00:39:41,978 --> 00:39:44,045
Hang on!

528
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:52,954
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

529
00:39:53,055 --> 00:39:55,223
Hey!

530
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:05,500
- Oh, no!
- Don't!

531
00:40:19,382 --> 00:40:21,582
get us down!

532
00:40:35,197 --> 00:40:37,899
- are ya all right, kid?
- Yeah, thanks.

533
00:40:39,468 --> 00:40:42,870
Holy smoke! A skunk!
Let's get outta here!

534
00:40:42,971 --> 00:40:46,574
- Duster!
- Jay!

535
00:40:47,476 --> 00:40:49,577
Duster,
you come back here!

536
00:40:52,948 --> 00:40:55,050
Where do you
think you're goin'?

537
00:40:55,151 --> 00:40:57,419
I gotta get Duster
before he falls off.

538
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,787
You stay here
and I'll...

539
00:40:59,888 --> 00:41:02,190
I'll go out
and get him.

540
00:41:17,373 --> 00:41:19,707
be careful, Duster!

541
00:41:53,875 --> 00:41:56,478
Boy, Duster.
You can come back now.

542
00:41:56,579 --> 00:41:58,746
we got Duster.

543
00:42:05,387 --> 00:42:06,621
Ow!

544
00:42:19,335 --> 00:42:21,102
Come on now, fella.

545
00:42:21,203 --> 00:42:24,139
Come on.
Slow and easy.

546
00:42:27,309 --> 00:42:29,244
No, son.
Come on back here.

547
00:42:29,345 --> 00:42:32,847
Gimme your hand, tex, rod.
Now come on, fella.

548
00:42:32,948 --> 00:42:34,749
Easy now. Don't look down.

549
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:36,984
Now come on.
Come on.

550
00:42:37,085 --> 00:42:38,853
Just another step.

551
00:42:39,755 --> 00:42:43,458
Nothin' to be afraid of.
That's it.

552
00:42:48,096 --> 00:42:51,199
Hold it, mister.
Hey, Mac, don't move.

553
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:54,169
- Bert, come back!
- Huh? What'd you say?

554
00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:56,103
Get back!

555
00:42:56,205 --> 00:42:58,406
Bert, don't step!

556
00:42:58,507 --> 00:43:00,041
Don't what?

557
00:43:00,142 --> 00:43:02,477
Bert, don't!

558
00:43:37,112 --> 00:43:39,180
Bert! Bert?

559
00:43:45,688 --> 00:43:48,789
How long did you say
it is until 4:00?

560
00:44:05,207 --> 00:44:07,475
Oh, what a haul.
A hundred grand!

561
00:44:07,576 --> 00:44:09,310
Plus a cowhide briefcase!

562
00:44:09,411 --> 00:44:11,779
Doesn't feel like
a hundred grand to me.

563
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,482
Maybe he wrote us
a check.

564
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:21,456
"having difficulty raising
the money. Will need more time.

565
00:44:21,557 --> 00:44:27,595
"probably until after Easter
vacation. J.W. Osborne. "

566
00:44:27,696 --> 00:44:29,964
"having difficulty
raising the money.

567
00:44:30,065 --> 00:44:34,502
"will need more time. Probably
until after Easter vacation. "

568
00:44:34,603 --> 00:44:37,305
That grandfather of yours
has got some sense of humor.

569
00:44:37,406 --> 00:44:38,806
But I don't understand.

570
00:44:38,907 --> 00:44:41,309
You don't understand?
Why, it's very simple.

571
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:43,978
Your grandfather
isn't taking us seriously.

572
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:46,781
Nobody's taking us seriously.

573
00:44:46,882 --> 00:44:48,516
What do we do, Duke?

574
00:44:48,617 --> 00:44:50,451
We get ourselves
out of this caper,

575
00:44:50,552 --> 00:44:54,289
And we ship those kids back to
their grandfather, that's what we do.

576
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:57,325
Ship them back? You mean,
give up the money entirely?

577
00:44:57,426 --> 00:44:58,959
Money? What money?

578
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:01,962
Don't you think he'll come up
with something to get 'em back?

579
00:45:02,063 --> 00:45:05,400
Would you? So far, all we've got
out of this kidnapping

580
00:45:05,501 --> 00:45:08,969
Is an I.O.U. And a
genuine leather briefcase.

581
00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:10,772
Yeah, but what about
big Joe?

582
00:45:10,872 --> 00:45:12,840
If we don't come up
with what we owe him,

583
00:45:12,941 --> 00:45:16,277
He's liable to go from
clickety-click to bangety-bang.

584
00:45:16,378 --> 00:45:18,446
We'll just take one thing
at a time. Now first...

585
00:45:18,547 --> 00:45:21,916
I don't care how much you pound
on that door. You can't come in.

586
00:45:22,017 --> 00:45:24,652
Our grandfather will never
pay that ransom. Never, never!

587
00:45:24,753 --> 00:45:28,255
- Did you leave the TV on upstairs?
- That's no TV.

588
00:45:28,357 --> 00:45:31,225
- help? How can I?
- give me that chair.

589
00:45:31,327 --> 00:45:33,661
Hold on now, Jay!
You can do it!

590
00:45:33,762 --> 00:45:37,164
I can't, Tracy. I can't.
They're pushing too hard.

591
00:45:37,265 --> 00:45:41,101
what'd you say? There's so much
noise I can't even hear you.

592
00:45:41,203 --> 00:45:44,372
Oh, no, there it goes.
They just broke down the door.

593
00:45:44,473 --> 00:45:46,607
- Help, help!
- They're here now.

594
00:45:46,709 --> 00:45:48,743
They're coming in.

595
00:45:48,844 --> 00:45:51,979
Tell grandfather...
Tell him to pray for us.

596
00:45:54,316 --> 00:45:56,951
Just who were
you talking to?

597
00:45:57,052 --> 00:45:59,387
- The police.
- The police!

598
00:45:59,488 --> 00:46:01,188
Now they'll
take you seriously.

599
00:46:01,289 --> 00:46:03,691
Might as well write
that second ransom note.

600
00:46:03,792 --> 00:46:06,561
Police'll be lookin'
for you anyway.

601
00:46:06,662 --> 00:46:08,596
The police?

602
00:46:08,697 --> 00:46:11,399
I'm beginnin' to feel more like
the kidnappee than the kidnapper.

603
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,668
I don't feel
like either one of them.

604
00:46:13,769 --> 00:46:16,537
Because there isn't going to be
a second ransom note.

605
00:46:18,106 --> 00:46:20,074
The police, already?

606
00:46:20,175 --> 00:46:21,843
That can't be the police.

607
00:46:21,943 --> 00:46:24,345
They only move that fast
to tow away parked cars.

608
00:46:24,446 --> 00:46:26,681
Well, go on.
Open the door.

609
00:46:28,617 --> 00:46:30,885
Who is it?

610
00:46:35,424 --> 00:46:37,224
It's for you, Duke.

611
00:46:40,028 --> 00:46:41,863
For me?

612
00:46:41,963 --> 00:46:44,665
Just happened to be in
the neighborhood, Duke.

613
00:46:44,767 --> 00:46:49,504
Thought I'd come by and give you
a friendly reminder: 48 hours.

614
00:46:49,605 --> 00:46:52,507
Hi, Joe.
Big Joe.

615
00:46:53,074 --> 00:46:54,442
48 hours, Duke.

616
00:46:54,543 --> 00:46:57,211
The computer doesn't like
to be kept waiting.

617
00:46:57,312 --> 00:47:00,648
Does it, Freddie?
No, it doesn't.

618
00:47:00,749 --> 00:47:04,285
Hello, kid.
How's the puddy cat?

619
00:47:04,386 --> 00:47:07,321
Joe, we're workin'
on the money.

620
00:47:07,423 --> 00:47:12,293
I hope so. We wouldn't want the computer
to blow a fuse, would we, Freddie?

621
00:47:12,394 --> 00:47:14,829
No, we wouldn't.

622
00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:17,965
- Buffalo, eh?
- What?

623
00:47:18,066 --> 00:47:20,234
Duke tells me
you're from buffalo.

624
00:47:21,637 --> 00:47:22,537
Oh, yes.

625
00:47:22,638 --> 00:47:24,972
You happen to know
a cousin of mine

626
00:47:25,073 --> 00:47:27,708
By the name
of Frankie Longtooth?

627
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:31,078
- No, I don't think so.
- That's funny.

628
00:47:31,179 --> 00:47:34,949
Frankie Longtooth is a very
prominent citizen in buffalo.

629
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:38,385
Look, Joe, you've got
my word for it.

630
00:47:38,487 --> 00:47:41,989
You'll get your money,
all $9,000.

631
00:47:44,893 --> 00:47:48,830
- Eleven thousand?
- Clickety-click.

632
00:47:49,765 --> 00:47:51,833
48 hours, Duke.

633
00:47:53,902 --> 00:47:59,306
I think we'd better make that
47 hours and 55 minutes.

634
00:48:01,743 --> 00:48:03,878
Clickety-click.

635
00:48:09,317 --> 00:48:11,318
- Sh...
- What are we gonna do, Duke?

636
00:48:11,419 --> 00:48:14,154
I'll tell ya what we're
gonna do. We're gonna...

637
00:48:14,255 --> 00:48:15,656
Write that second ransom note,

638
00:48:15,757 --> 00:48:18,459
That's what we're gonna do.

639
00:48:21,296 --> 00:48:22,997
Harry, you guys
are supposed to be

640
00:48:23,098 --> 00:48:24,999
The best crime lab
in the state.

641
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:26,400
Sergeant turner?

642
00:48:26,502 --> 00:48:29,269
I know it's a tape Mark.
What about it? What kind?

643
00:48:29,371 --> 00:48:30,605
Sergeant turner?

644
00:48:30,706 --> 00:48:32,740
Shh. All right.
Stay on it, will ya?

645
00:48:32,841 --> 00:48:34,208
Sergeant turner.

646
00:48:34,309 --> 00:48:37,211
I have waited five long years
for that guy to surface.

647
00:48:37,312 --> 00:48:40,147
It isn't often a man gets
a second Chance like this.

648
00:48:40,248 --> 00:48:42,950
I tell you there is no way
he's gonna escape me this time.

649
00:48:43,051 --> 00:48:45,252
- There may be one way.
- How?

650
00:48:45,353 --> 00:48:46,821
- We're off the case.
- Off?

651
00:48:46,922 --> 00:48:48,389
- Off.
- Off.

652
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:51,425
- I got a kidnapping for you.
- What about the safecracker?

653
00:48:51,527 --> 00:48:53,861
The children of JW Osborne.
I want you two there.

654
00:48:53,962 --> 00:48:55,329
- But my...
- Immediately.

655
00:48:55,430 --> 00:48:57,565
You're expected.
Here's the address.

656
00:48:57,666 --> 00:49:00,167
- Go.
- Yes, sir.

657
00:49:00,268 --> 00:49:03,771
And Max, this is no phantom
safecracker you're playing with.

658
00:49:03,872 --> 00:49:06,974
These are dangerous men,
so proceed cautiously.

659
00:49:07,075 --> 00:49:10,011
And Max, be tactful.

660
00:49:10,111 --> 00:49:14,181
You're going to have a nervous,
worried grandfather on your hands.

661
00:49:19,521 --> 00:49:22,456
Mr. Osborne, the police
are here about Tracy and Jay.

662
00:49:24,225 --> 00:49:27,762
There, sir Winston. They haven't
found them already, have they?

663
00:49:27,863 --> 00:49:29,797
- No, sir.
- Oh, thank goodness.

664
00:49:29,898 --> 00:49:33,434
Once the strong arm of the law starts muscling
us around, it'll be "do this, do that. "

665
00:49:33,535 --> 00:49:35,937
They'll have us paying that ransom,
and you know what that means.

666
00:49:36,038 --> 00:49:37,572
I do, sir.

667
00:49:37,673 --> 00:49:41,075
Well, it was a splendid little
vacation while it lasted.

668
00:49:41,176 --> 00:49:43,911
Send them in.

669
00:49:46,281 --> 00:49:48,883
this way, sergeant.

670
00:49:48,984 --> 00:49:53,854
Mr. Osborne, sergeant turner
here. Detective Longnecker.

671
00:49:53,956 --> 00:49:56,156
- Gentlemen.
- This is a nasty business.

672
00:49:56,257 --> 00:49:58,793
We know what
you're going through,

673
00:49:58,894 --> 00:50:01,028
But we do have a way
of handling these things.

674
00:50:01,129 --> 00:50:03,297
Now, I know you're
gonna argue with me,

675
00:50:03,398 --> 00:50:06,467
But what we want you
to do is absolutely nothing.

676
00:50:10,238 --> 00:50:11,672
Nothing?

677
00:50:11,773 --> 00:50:13,340
That's right.
Ignore the note.

678
00:50:13,441 --> 00:50:16,276
No contact. No ransom.
Nothing.

679
00:50:16,377 --> 00:50:19,279
It's what we call our "projected
low-profile procedure. "

680
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:23,350
- Longnecker.
- In our kidnapping studies at the academy, we found...

681
00:50:23,451 --> 00:50:26,721
We'll be in touch,
Mr. Osborne.

682
00:50:26,822 --> 00:50:29,690
Meantime,
try to relax, sir.

683
00:50:29,791 --> 00:50:32,960
Rest assured, Mr. Osborne.
We're right on top of it.

684
00:50:42,070 --> 00:50:43,470
Jameson.

685
00:50:43,571 --> 00:50:47,274
Now that the police are "right
on top of it," to coin a phrase...

686
00:50:47,375 --> 00:50:50,244
We wouldn't want to interfere
in their little investigation.

687
00:50:50,345 --> 00:50:53,881
It would be positively insulting to tell
them where the children are, wouldn't it?

688
00:50:53,982 --> 00:50:55,983
Oh, most definitely, sir.

689
00:50:56,084 --> 00:50:58,019
You've just earned yourself
another bonus.

690
00:51:02,490 --> 00:51:04,424
- What are you doing?
- Opening your safe.

691
00:51:04,526 --> 00:51:06,560
You're what?

692
00:51:06,662 --> 00:51:09,697
Just one more tumbler
to go.

693
00:51:09,798 --> 00:51:13,367
Oh, I figured out what everything
was for. It's rather easy.

694
00:51:13,468 --> 00:51:15,903
But you...

695
00:51:17,005 --> 00:51:19,740
Sure.
Safecrackin's a cinch.

696
00:51:19,841 --> 00:51:22,209
Are you going to mail
the ransom note?

697
00:51:22,310 --> 00:51:25,646
You just go on
playin' with the safe

698
00:51:25,747 --> 00:51:27,314
And stay out of trouble.

699
00:51:29,484 --> 00:51:31,485
- Duke!
- Are you finished pasting up the note?

700
00:51:31,586 --> 00:51:33,487
A- a-almost.
Duke, we're on TV.

701
00:51:33,588 --> 00:51:36,323
<i>please, please, please.
One question at a time.</i>

702
00:51:36,424 --> 00:51:38,192
<i>with just
a phone call to go on,</i>

703
00:51:38,293 --> 00:51:40,161
<i>How do you expect
to crack the case?</i>

704
00:51:40,261 --> 00:51:42,963
<i>We've only been on the case a
few hours. Easy there, fella.</i>

705
00:51:43,065 --> 00:51:45,399
<i>We'll have to wait and see
what tomorrow brings.</i>

706
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:48,468
<i>haven't you made that "tomorrow"
speech a few other times, sergeant?</i>

707
00:51:48,570 --> 00:51:50,838
<i>turner!</i>

708
00:51:50,939 --> 00:51:53,708
<i>...Like with the phantom
safecracker a few years ago?</i>

709
00:51:53,809 --> 00:51:55,710
<i>You got a good memory,
Sandy.</i>

710
00:51:55,811 --> 00:51:58,713
Duke, is that the Guy you've been
givin' the slip to all these years?

711
00:51:58,814 --> 00:52:00,848
Yeah. I've never
seen him before.

712
00:52:00,949 --> 00:52:04,885
Good thing TV isn't two-way.
He'd be lookin' right at ya.

713
00:52:04,986 --> 00:52:07,054
<i>Eventually I will
catch that safecracker,</i>

714
00:52:07,155 --> 00:52:10,191
<i>But at the moment, there are
two kids and $100,000 at stake.</i>

715
00:52:10,291 --> 00:52:14,929
75. I reduced it
from 100,000 to 75.

716
00:52:15,030 --> 00:52:17,198
Sort of like
a clearance sale, huh?

717
00:52:17,298 --> 00:52:19,033
Anything to unload
those kids.

718
00:52:21,603 --> 00:52:24,972
If turner's on this, we gotta
move fast. Where's that note?

719
00:52:25,073 --> 00:52:26,774
you're kinda wearin' it.

720
00:52:26,875 --> 00:52:29,343
What?

721
00:52:31,947 --> 00:52:33,447
Where's the envelope?

722
00:52:33,548 --> 00:52:36,450
I didn't finish the note yet.
I didn't put the date on.

723
00:52:36,551 --> 00:52:39,153
It's fine.
It's just fine.

724
00:52:39,254 --> 00:52:41,321
I'll be back
in about an hour.

725
00:52:41,422 --> 00:52:43,690
An hour, just to mail
a ransom note?

726
00:52:43,792 --> 00:52:46,426
- I don't wanna mail it in the neighborhood.
- Can I go with ya?

727
00:52:46,527 --> 00:52:49,163
'course not. With the police
lookin' all over for those kids,

728
00:52:49,264 --> 00:52:50,898
Somebody's gotta watch 'em.

729
00:52:50,999 --> 00:52:53,768
Why do I always get
the dangerous part?

730
00:52:53,869 --> 00:52:56,904
What can be dangerous about
taking care of a couple of kids?

731
00:52:57,005 --> 00:52:59,974
Hey, is this
real dynamite?

732
00:53:00,075 --> 00:53:03,343
Give me that
and don't throw... Ah!

733
00:53:07,082 --> 00:53:09,383
Well, is it?

734
00:53:11,519 --> 00:53:14,922
You stay out of our supplies.
You hear me?

735
00:53:15,023 --> 00:53:17,691
Well, Duster and I have
nothing to do. We're bored.

736
00:53:17,793 --> 00:53:19,626
When your sister's through
playin' in there,

737
00:53:19,727 --> 00:53:23,497
Why don't you go on in and try
opening up my safe with my tools?

738
00:53:23,598 --> 00:53:27,434
No, thanks.
I'd rather use dynamite.

739
00:53:27,535 --> 00:53:29,436
Duke, can I please mail
the ransom note?

740
00:53:29,537 --> 00:53:33,373
No. You stay here
and keep 'em busy.

741
00:53:35,610 --> 00:53:38,846
- Well?
- Well, what?

742
00:53:38,947 --> 00:53:41,048
He said you were
to keep me busy.

743
00:53:46,087 --> 00:53:51,292
I'll tell ya what. I'll give ya
your choice: Old maid or go fish.

744
00:53:51,392 --> 00:53:55,229
- I hate cards.
- What then?

745
00:53:55,330 --> 00:53:57,464
I got it. Judo.

746
00:53:57,565 --> 00:54:01,035
- I don't know anything about judo.
- Well, I do.

747
00:54:01,136 --> 00:54:03,938
Duster, you sit right there
and watch this.

748
00:54:04,039 --> 00:54:06,606
come on, Jay,
that wouldn't be fair.

749
00:54:06,708 --> 00:54:08,742
A man like me against
a fella like you...

750
00:54:08,844 --> 00:54:11,545
C'mon, two falls outta three.

751
00:54:11,646 --> 00:54:14,215
Grab my wrist.

752
00:54:21,723 --> 00:54:25,459
ha-rah!

753
00:54:31,933 --> 00:54:36,470
You're right. You don't know
anything about judo.

754
00:54:39,841 --> 00:54:42,309
I have a feeling
I'm gonna learn.

755
00:54:42,410 --> 00:54:45,346
Well, the note's
in the mail.

756
00:54:45,446 --> 00:54:47,714
hi, Duke.

757
00:54:51,786 --> 00:54:54,188
Don't tell me.
Charades, right?

758
00:54:54,289 --> 00:54:57,591
- You're a pretzel.
- my first judo lesson.

759
00:54:57,692 --> 00:55:01,362
Judo? Oh, Bert.

760
00:55:01,462 --> 00:55:05,866
Duke, you wouldn't wanna send
another ransom note, would ya?

761
00:55:05,967 --> 00:55:09,870
And lower it to $50,000. Before Jay
comes back with lesson number two.

762
00:55:09,971 --> 00:55:11,906
Back?
Back from where?

763
00:55:12,007 --> 00:55:13,874
He went out to get
some liniment.

764
00:55:13,975 --> 00:55:16,777
How long's he been gone?

765
00:55:16,878 --> 00:55:18,412
Can you see my watch?

766
00:55:18,513 --> 00:55:20,347
You mean you let
those kids outta here

767
00:55:20,448 --> 00:55:24,318
When we're this close to getting
that computer off of our back?

768
00:55:27,188 --> 00:55:30,324
I'm looking for a Mr. Duke
and a Mr. Bert.

769
00:55:34,396 --> 00:55:36,730
We have the children
down at the station.

770
00:55:36,831 --> 00:55:39,766
I'm going to have to ask
you gentlemen to come with me.

771
00:55:39,867 --> 00:55:43,170
Well, gentlemen, I'm afraid
you're in a little trouble.

772
00:55:43,271 --> 00:55:45,105
But, sergeant,
if I could just explain.

773
00:55:45,206 --> 00:55:46,840
You've been ID'ed
by the kids.

774
00:55:46,942 --> 00:55:49,410
It was the girl's fault.
It was her idea.

775
00:55:49,510 --> 00:55:51,478
- That's right.
- We didn't want any part of it.

776
00:55:51,579 --> 00:55:52,446
No, we had...

777
00:55:52,547 --> 00:55:54,514
It's too late now.
The law's the law.

778
00:55:54,615 --> 00:55:57,751
Sure, the law's the law. An eye
for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

779
00:55:57,852 --> 00:56:00,720
If you've got an animal,
you've gotta have a license.

780
00:56:00,822 --> 00:56:02,522
But there's such a thing
as mercy...

781
00:56:02,623 --> 00:56:05,225
And a right to stand before the
bar of Justice and say "animal"!

782
00:56:05,327 --> 00:56:07,761
Animal? License?
Animal license?

783
00:56:07,862 --> 00:56:09,496
That's what we're here for,
right?

784
00:56:09,597 --> 00:56:10,797
- Certainly.
- Right!

785
00:56:10,898 --> 00:56:13,200
uncle Duke,
uncle Bert, hi.

786
00:56:13,301 --> 00:56:16,270
We lost Duster on the way home,
but then we found him.

787
00:56:16,371 --> 00:56:17,771
Sure.

788
00:56:17,872 --> 00:56:19,573
Well, I guess that about
wraps it up, right?

789
00:56:19,674 --> 00:56:22,309
Not quite.
$2.00 for the license.

790
00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:24,644
$2.Oo. Yes, of course,
certainly.

791
00:56:29,050 --> 00:56:31,818
I don't...
I haven't got... Oh.

792
00:56:34,289 --> 00:56:35,990
there we go.

793
00:56:36,091 --> 00:56:38,292
- And a form to fill out.
- Form.

794
00:56:38,393 --> 00:56:40,294
Mind if we take it home
and fill it out?

795
00:56:40,395 --> 00:56:42,429
- Suit yourself.
- Thank you very much.

796
00:56:42,530 --> 00:56:44,498
I'll check on that M.O.
Right now, sergeant turner.

797
00:56:44,599 --> 00:56:48,168
On second thought, I think
I'll fill it out right here.

798
00:56:48,269 --> 00:56:51,838
Okay, Benson.
Turn 'em over.

799
00:56:51,939 --> 00:56:55,075
I know you guys got fingerprints
off the safe at the airport.

800
00:56:55,176 --> 00:56:58,512
I thought you were off
that case, you old bulldog.

801
00:56:58,613 --> 00:57:01,448
I'll be off it when I see
that safecracker behind bars.

802
00:57:01,549 --> 00:57:03,283
- Excuse me.
- Perfectly all right.

803
00:57:03,385 --> 00:57:04,651
Anything break
on the kidnapping?

804
00:57:04,752 --> 00:57:06,387
Not yet.
We don't have any pictures.

805
00:57:06,488 --> 00:57:08,522
All we know
is a couple of kids.

806
00:57:08,623 --> 00:57:11,525
Girl about her age,
boy about his age.

807
00:57:11,626 --> 00:57:14,094
Probably in the hands
of a couple of hoodlums.

808
00:57:14,195 --> 00:57:16,830
Isn't that terrible,
uncle Duke and uncle Bert?

809
00:57:16,931 --> 00:57:20,267
Two kids our age, in the hands
of a couple of hoodlums.

810
00:57:20,368 --> 00:57:21,368
Yeah, it's terrible.

811
00:57:21,469 --> 00:57:23,103
Here are the prints.
They're smudgy.

812
00:57:23,204 --> 00:57:25,672
They'll do.
Believe me, Benson.

813
00:57:25,773 --> 00:57:27,707
Those kidnappers
and that safecracker

814
00:57:27,808 --> 00:57:30,244
Aren't slipping through
my fingers this time.

815
00:57:30,345 --> 00:57:32,812
- Excuse me.
- Perfectly all right.

816
00:57:36,451 --> 00:57:39,453
Thank you, sergeant.
Come on, uncle Bert.

817
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:55,301
Jay, you gonna be out
of there soon?

818
00:57:55,402 --> 00:57:56,402
In just a minute.

819
00:57:56,504 --> 00:57:59,205
I'm brushing
Duster's teeth.

820
00:58:01,542 --> 00:58:04,377
Brushing a skunk's teeth.

821
00:58:04,478 --> 00:58:06,713
Hey, whose toothbrush
you using?

822
00:58:06,814 --> 00:58:08,749
Never mind, never mind.
I don't wanna know.

823
00:58:09,550 --> 00:58:12,185
well?

824
00:58:13,287 --> 00:58:15,555
Well, the third ransom note
is on its way.

825
00:58:15,657 --> 00:58:17,257
The rest is up to grandpa.

826
00:58:17,358 --> 00:58:20,927
After a day like today, I sure
am glad we lowered it to 50 g's.

827
00:58:21,029 --> 00:58:24,364
After a day like today,
I lowered it to 30.

828
00:58:25,833 --> 00:58:28,869
You know, though, they're not
really bad kids to have around.

829
00:58:28,970 --> 00:58:31,972
- If you've got hospitalization.
- Yeah, right.

830
00:58:34,742 --> 00:58:36,509
What are you doing?

831
00:58:36,610 --> 00:58:41,581
Do you realize anybody could walk
in here... The police, big Joe.

832
00:58:41,683 --> 00:58:43,550
The security here is lousy.

833
00:58:43,651 --> 00:58:46,953
What would you suggest? A nest
of rattlesnakes at the front door?

834
00:58:47,055 --> 00:58:49,289
Not a bad idea.
I'll put that on my list.

835
00:58:49,390 --> 00:58:51,391
List? What list?
What is this?

836
00:58:51,492 --> 00:58:55,562
I got a bunch of things here that
could make this place foolproof.

837
00:58:55,663 --> 00:58:56,797
If you take a rope...

838
00:58:56,898 --> 00:58:58,598
I thought I told you
to take a bath.

839
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:01,001
I was too busy thinking.
And you take it...

840
00:59:01,102 --> 00:59:04,037
Well, we are taking you
to your grandfather's clean.

841
00:59:04,138 --> 00:59:05,972
But we're going
to Hong Kong.

842
00:59:09,711 --> 00:59:11,211
I've got dinner.

843
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:16,516
Or do I? My nose tells me
this is better.

844
00:59:16,617 --> 00:59:19,219
mmm, that smells
terrific. What is it?

845
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:21,188
Chili relleno.
Maria's special recipe.

846
00:59:21,288 --> 00:59:23,256
Maria.
That your mother?

847
00:59:23,357 --> 00:59:25,225
Uh-uh. Our maid.
She's Mexican.

848
00:59:25,326 --> 00:59:27,293
Mexican, huh?

849
00:59:27,394 --> 00:59:29,629
What are these funny-looking
little hamburgers here?

850
00:59:29,731 --> 00:59:32,099
- Swedish meatballs.
- Swedish?

851
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:33,967
That Maria
certainly got around.

852
00:59:34,068 --> 00:59:37,704
- They were Hilda’s recipe.
- Hilda. That's another maid?

853
00:59:37,805 --> 00:59:40,340
Uh-huh.

854
00:59:40,441 --> 00:59:44,644
Sounds like you spend
an awful lot of time with maids.

855
00:59:44,746 --> 00:59:46,913
Mother's the head
of a magazine.

856
00:59:47,014 --> 00:59:51,752
Oh, well, I see.
I didn't know that.

857
00:59:51,853 --> 00:59:55,255
And that keeps her
very busy.

858
00:59:56,257 --> 00:59:59,659
Yeah, su-sure, sure.
I can understand that.

859
01:00:01,129 --> 01:00:03,296
Hope you like your
baked apples cinnamon.

860
01:00:03,397 --> 01:00:05,565
Baked apples with cinnamon?
mmm.

861
01:00:05,666 --> 01:00:07,333
they're my favorite.

862
01:00:07,434 --> 01:00:08,969
I know.
Bert told me.

863
01:00:09,070 --> 01:00:11,171
oh, he did, did he?

864
01:00:11,272 --> 01:00:13,573
I've been doing
a little research myself,

865
01:00:13,674 --> 01:00:19,479
And Jay tells me that you
are a perfect size eight.

866
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:22,348
Is that right?

867
01:00:25,452 --> 01:00:27,788
- For me?
- Mm.

868
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:34,861
I love it.

869
01:00:34,962 --> 01:00:39,099
And green's my favorite color.
Did Jay tell you that too?

870
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:43,069
No. Just a guess.

871
01:00:46,307 --> 01:00:49,542
Well, that was a pretty
lucky guess, I guess.

872
01:00:57,584 --> 01:01:00,386
Is it too late
to lower that to 25,000?

873
01:01:05,726 --> 01:01:07,627
I'll tell Mr. Osborne
you're here.

874
01:01:07,728 --> 01:01:09,429
He's just finishing
breakfast.

875
01:01:09,530 --> 01:01:13,366
- Slept late, you see.
- It's almost noon.

876
01:01:13,467 --> 01:01:15,435
Grandchildren in the hands
of kidnappers,

877
01:01:15,536 --> 01:01:19,372
The old man sleeps till noon.
He's a strange one.

878
01:01:19,473 --> 01:01:20,841
Strange?

879
01:01:20,942 --> 01:01:24,244
A distraught grandfather pacing
the floor half the night,

880
01:01:24,345 --> 01:01:27,214
Finally falling, exhausted,
into a fitful slumber at dawn.

881
01:01:27,315 --> 01:01:30,016
- He has to sleep until noon.
- Longnecker.

882
01:01:30,117 --> 01:01:32,685
The courage of the man.
Just you wait, sergeant.

883
01:01:32,786 --> 01:01:35,388
I'll bet the old guy comes in
smiling and cheerful,

884
01:01:35,489 --> 01:01:37,490
Covering up, like there's
nothing on his mind.

885
01:01:37,591 --> 01:01:39,392
Well, well, and top of
the morning to both of you.

886
01:01:39,493 --> 01:01:41,261
What brings you two
around so early?

887
01:01:41,362 --> 01:01:43,663
- The ransom note.
- The ransom note?

888
01:01:43,764 --> 01:01:45,732
- I gave it to you yesterday.
- The new one.

889
01:01:45,833 --> 01:01:47,234
Your man called us about it
over an hour ago.

890
01:01:47,335 --> 01:01:49,702
Oh, forgive me. I've had so many
lately, I get muddled.

891
01:01:49,803 --> 01:01:52,839
We're losing over 20,000 cells
a day, you know.

892
01:01:53,807 --> 01:01:55,475
What does it say?

893
01:01:55,576 --> 01:01:58,011
We'll find out when
we get it open, won't we?

894
01:01:58,112 --> 01:02:01,214
If I was a betting man, I
wouldn't mind risking a ten-spot

895
01:02:01,315 --> 01:02:05,919
They've come down
to, um, 35,000 by now.

896
01:02:07,154 --> 01:02:11,024
Uh-oh, missed it by five.
They're down to 30.

897
01:02:11,125 --> 01:02:14,794
I must say, your "do nothing"
plan is working beautifully.

898
01:02:14,896 --> 01:02:18,331
Uh, mind if I take
that note, Mr. Osborne?

899
01:02:18,432 --> 01:02:22,668
By all means. Anything I can
to help. Keep up the good work.

900
01:02:22,770 --> 01:02:25,138
I want you to know, sir,
you have an admirer here.

901
01:02:25,239 --> 01:02:27,240
Longnecker.

902
01:02:37,184 --> 01:02:38,285
Fore.

903
01:02:38,386 --> 01:02:42,488
"4:00, wharf 33, san Pedro.
Be there in person. "

904
01:02:42,589 --> 01:02:44,224
Sir, I've been giving
this case a lot of thought,

905
01:02:44,325 --> 01:02:46,092
And I have a theory,
if I may.

906
01:02:46,193 --> 01:02:48,861
I had a course in the law of
probability at the academy.

907
01:02:48,963 --> 01:02:52,132
Fact: The kidnapper and the
safecracker were at the airport

908
01:02:52,233 --> 01:02:54,167
On the very same night
at the same hour.

909
01:02:54,268 --> 01:02:57,237
Fact: They both disappeared
at precisely the same instant.

910
01:02:57,338 --> 01:02:59,973
Fact: Neither one of them
has been seen to this moment.

911
01:03:00,074 --> 01:03:05,445
Query: Could the safecracker and the
kidnapper be one and the same person?

912
01:03:05,546 --> 01:03:09,215
Longnecker, a safecracker
is a safecracker,

913
01:03:09,317 --> 01:03:11,051
And a kidnapper
is a kidnapper,

914
01:03:11,152 --> 01:03:13,453
And I wish I could say
a policeman was a policeman.

915
01:03:13,554 --> 01:03:14,988
Am I confusing you?

916
01:03:15,089 --> 01:03:17,590
I thought it would be some useful
information in solving the case.

917
01:03:17,691 --> 01:03:19,826
I have some useful information.

918
01:03:19,927 --> 01:03:24,097
Our "do nothing" plan is about
to become a "do something" plan.

919
01:03:24,832 --> 01:03:27,533
- Move!
- Oh, yeah.

920
01:03:32,473 --> 01:03:35,041
Do you have
the keys, sir?

921
01:03:35,142 --> 01:03:36,809
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

922
01:03:36,910 --> 01:03:41,514
Well, what time does the 6:30
flight get to Honolulu?

923
01:03:41,615 --> 01:03:45,085
And then when would
we get to Hong Kong?

924
01:03:45,186 --> 01:03:48,121
I'd like to make
a reservation for two,

925
01:03:48,222 --> 01:03:50,223
Nancy Adams
and her brother, John.

926
01:03:50,324 --> 01:03:51,791
I thought we were going.

927
01:03:51,892 --> 01:03:55,928
Shh! We can't give out our real
name with people looking for us.

928
01:03:57,431 --> 01:04:01,334
We'll pay for the tickets
when we get there, in cash.

929
01:04:02,569 --> 01:04:05,705
- Well, it's all set.
- So's this.

930
01:04:08,742 --> 01:04:10,210
What are you doing
up there?

931
01:04:10,311 --> 01:04:13,113
Just working on a couple of
inventions to protect us.

932
01:04:13,214 --> 01:04:14,481
Protect us?

933
01:04:14,581 --> 01:04:16,849
If anybody gets in,
they'll never get out.

934
01:04:16,950 --> 01:04:17,884
Oh, yeah?

935
01:04:17,985 --> 01:04:20,253
Oh, Duke!
Everything's set.

936
01:04:20,354 --> 01:04:23,689
Got us some great wheels. Bo Beasley
brought his car in for repairs.

937
01:04:23,790 --> 01:04:26,159
- Okay, let's-
- I called the airlines, Duke.

938
01:04:26,260 --> 01:04:30,497
If you come back with the money by
5:00, we can make the 6:30 flight.

939
01:04:30,597 --> 01:04:32,532
Yeah.

940
01:04:32,633 --> 01:04:36,136
If we don't get moving, nobody's
going to be going anywhere. Come on.

941
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:42,909
Could that possibly
be you, big Joe?

942
01:04:43,010 --> 01:04:45,245
it's him.

943
01:04:47,148 --> 01:04:49,916
Computer just reminded me, Duke.
Two and a half hours.

944
01:04:50,017 --> 01:04:54,654
We'll have your $11,000...

945
01:04:56,390 --> 01:05:00,860
You'll get your $13,000
by then, big Joe.

946
01:05:00,961 --> 01:05:02,695
That's good, Duke.

947
01:05:05,799 --> 01:05:09,635
Are you sure that you've never
heard of my cousin Frankie Longtooth?

948
01:05:09,736 --> 01:05:11,271
No, sir.

949
01:05:11,372 --> 01:05:14,974
Hmm. Maybe you would know him
by his legitimate name.

950
01:05:15,076 --> 01:05:17,177
John Smith?

951
01:05:20,214 --> 01:05:23,349
Huh, that's funny.

952
01:05:23,451 --> 01:05:25,985
Very prominent
in buffalo.

953
01:05:27,688 --> 01:05:28,955
Seen your mother lately?

954
01:05:29,056 --> 01:05:31,524
oh, no. No.
Mom's up in, uh...

955
01:05:31,625 --> 01:05:33,426
'member, I told you?

956
01:05:33,527 --> 01:05:35,395
I thought maybe you forgot.

957
01:05:35,496 --> 01:05:39,199
I didn't forget. Me and
the computer never forget.

958
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:41,534
Uh-uh.

959
01:05:50,043 --> 01:05:52,212
Oh, boy.
One of these days...

960
01:05:56,817 --> 01:05:58,784
Come on.
Let's go.

961
01:05:58,885 --> 01:06:00,853
Now, you kids remain
quiet and hidden,

962
01:06:00,954 --> 01:06:03,623
And don't open that door
for anybody, you hear?

963
01:06:03,724 --> 01:06:06,359
I told you. You have nothing
to worry about.

964
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:09,295
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on.
- Oh, I gotta get my jacket.

965
01:06:09,396 --> 01:06:11,464
I have the whole apartment
protected.

966
01:06:11,565 --> 01:06:14,734
Oh, sure. Well, it's one thing
to know something about judo,

967
01:06:14,835 --> 01:06:17,237
But if somebody
goes pushin' in that door...

968
01:06:22,143 --> 01:06:24,877
Boy!
It works great!

969
01:06:24,978 --> 01:06:30,683
Between you and the pencil, that
grandfather of yours better be there.

970
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:40,160
Let's go.

971
01:06:49,703 --> 01:06:52,338
Mr. Osborne,
the children's mother's here.

972
01:06:53,073 --> 01:06:54,974
Carolyn, here?

973
01:06:55,075 --> 01:06:58,811
- Carolyn, my dear. How did...
- How did I find out?

974
01:06:58,912 --> 01:07:02,048
I got a wire in Hong Kong from
the police. That's how I found out.

975
01:07:02,149 --> 01:07:03,916
Have you heard from
Tracy and Jay?

976
01:07:04,017 --> 01:07:07,520
Not exactly, but I assure you,
they're fine.

977
01:07:07,621 --> 01:07:10,723
They're fine! In the hands
of kidnappers, they're fine.

978
01:07:10,824 --> 01:07:12,758
Well, we have a rendezvous
with them in an hour.

979
01:07:12,859 --> 01:07:14,927
Then what are we standing
around here for?

980
01:07:15,028 --> 01:07:18,264
It's the police, Carolyn.
The police, it's their idea.

981
01:07:18,365 --> 01:07:20,700
They've been handling the case
beautifully, haven't they?

982
01:07:21,968 --> 01:07:24,337
They feel that if
we hand over the ransom,

983
01:07:24,438 --> 01:07:26,839
It would be bad
for their plans.

984
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:28,808
Their plans!

985
01:07:28,909 --> 01:07:31,211
I don't believe this.

986
01:07:31,312 --> 01:07:35,014
It's fine to be cold and
calculating when you're the police,

987
01:07:35,115 --> 01:07:37,350
But you're
their grandfather!

988
01:07:37,451 --> 01:07:39,952
How did they get kidnapped
in the first place?

989
01:07:40,053 --> 01:07:42,622
- It happened rather suddenly...
- Where's that meeting place?

990
01:07:42,723 --> 01:07:45,124
- I'm going there.
- Wait a minute. Hold it...

991
01:07:45,226 --> 01:07:46,726
I'll drive you there.

992
01:07:46,827 --> 01:07:49,629
We need some money. Jameson, you
stay here in case the police call.

993
01:07:49,730 --> 01:07:52,998
I'll wait in the car.
Please hurry.

994
01:07:53,100 --> 01:07:56,102
I beg your pardon, but wouldn't
it be simpler to call Peter

995
01:07:56,203 --> 01:07:59,606
And have him pick up the children
rather than pay the ransom?

996
01:07:59,707 --> 01:08:02,174
If my daughter-in-law discovered I
knew the whereabouts of the children,

997
01:08:02,276 --> 01:08:04,644
It would hardly cement our
budding relationship, would it?

998
01:08:04,745 --> 01:08:06,412
You do have a point, sir.

999
01:08:06,513 --> 01:08:09,649
Wouldn't you say it's worth 10 or 15,000
to water that flowering friendship?

1000
01:08:09,750 --> 01:08:10,916
I do indeed, sir.

1001
01:08:11,017 --> 01:08:13,085
Good thinking, Jameson.
You've just earned yourself-

1002
01:08:13,186 --> 01:08:15,988
Another bonus.
Thank you very much, sir.

1003
01:08:23,631 --> 01:08:25,831
The kids
in Duke's apartment!

1004
01:08:25,932 --> 01:08:27,900
Buffalo!

1005
01:08:28,001 --> 01:08:31,671
And me and the computer had Bert
and Duke figured for two-bit hoods.

1006
01:08:31,772 --> 01:08:34,173
They got the caper
of the year goin'.

1007
01:08:34,275 --> 01:08:38,344
"it is rumored that the ransom demand is almost $100,000
-"

1008
01:08:40,648 --> 01:08:43,549
One hundred thousand
dollars. That's chicken feed.

1009
01:08:43,651 --> 01:08:47,487
They are two-bit hoods. Old
man Osbornes are worth millions.

1010
01:08:47,588 --> 01:08:51,624
Freddie, I think it's time
for the pros to take over.

1011
01:08:51,725 --> 01:08:53,593
Anything wrong, sir?
Can I help you?

1012
01:08:53,694 --> 01:08:57,062
No, thank you. We're
about to help ourselves.

1013
01:09:16,817 --> 01:09:19,919
Okay, that's fine. Now keep
it coming. Keep it coming.

1014
01:09:20,020 --> 01:09:23,523
'scuse me.
What wharf is this?

1015
01:09:23,624 --> 01:09:26,726
- Wharf 32.
- Thank you.

1016
01:09:26,827 --> 01:09:28,894
Wharf 32.

1017
01:09:30,564 --> 01:09:35,601
- Next is, uh-
- wharf 33.

1018
01:09:35,703 --> 01:09:37,737
Right, right.
I'm sorry, Duke.

1019
01:09:37,838 --> 01:09:39,972
I guess I'm just
a little nervous.

1020
01:09:40,073 --> 01:09:43,042
I got the whole thing again. Sweaty
palms, butterflies in the stomach.

1021
01:09:43,143 --> 01:09:45,545
And we're nowhere
near the airport.

1022
01:09:45,646 --> 01:09:48,848
I bet you it isn't planes
at all. I'm a nervous wreck.

1023
01:09:51,218 --> 01:09:53,619
We don't know what
they're driving, Henderson.

1024
01:09:53,721 --> 01:09:55,855
Anything at all that approaches,
check in.

1025
01:09:55,956 --> 01:10:00,059
<i>right, sir. Don't worry.
I'm perched like an eagle.</i>

1026
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:02,962
Can't miss a thing
from up here. Out.

1027
01:10:03,063 --> 01:10:05,865
Oh, you're gonna love
this trap, sergeant.

1028
01:10:05,966 --> 01:10:09,034
I borrowed it from the
old spider-and-fly routine...

1029
01:10:09,135 --> 01:10:12,204
We learned at the acad
- uh, you know the place I mean.

1030
01:10:13,807 --> 01:10:17,309
Are you trying to tell me
this looks like J.W. Osborne?

1031
01:10:17,411 --> 01:10:19,746
Sir, you're the image.

1032
01:10:19,847 --> 01:10:21,914
- It's ridiculous.
- Oh, but, sir!

1033
01:10:22,015 --> 01:10:24,751
I can't see. I can't breathe.
And there's no room for my nose!

1034
01:10:24,852 --> 01:10:28,755
Sir, it's a work of art. Department
four was working on this all night.

1035
01:10:28,856 --> 01:10:50,242
Now, why don't you just give it a Chance
to fit to the contours of your face.

1036
01:10:50,343 --> 01:10:53,178
Huh. Huh.
You're right.

1037
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:56,616
It does feel better.
I still can't see.

1038
01:10:56,717 --> 01:10:59,852
But I seem to be able to breathe
easier. Ah, how's it look?

1039
01:10:59,953 --> 01:11:01,721
You sure I look
like Osborne?

1040
01:11:02,790 --> 01:11:05,491
Exactly.

1041
01:11:06,393 --> 01:11:09,061
what are you doin'?

1042
01:11:09,162 --> 01:11:12,832
If this doesn't work, Longnecker,
I'm burning down the academy.

1043
01:11:12,933 --> 01:11:16,368
<i>Charlie four to C.Q.
Charlie four to C.Q.</i>

1044
01:11:16,470 --> 01:11:18,971
Uh, hello Charlie four.
Uh, hello. This is C.Q.

1045
01:11:19,072 --> 01:11:22,207
Henderson here. Suspicious car
now entering wharf area.

1046
01:11:22,309 --> 01:11:26,579
They have just passed dock 32
and are headed for your position.

1047
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:28,981
Suspicious car
headed for our position.

1048
01:11:29,082 --> 01:11:30,249
I heard it.

1049
01:11:30,350 --> 01:11:32,117
Stay alert.

1050
01:11:32,218 --> 01:11:34,754
This must be them,
sir.

1051
01:11:37,390 --> 01:11:39,892
There's a little
red car comin'.

1052
01:11:39,993 --> 01:11:42,795
There they are.

1053
01:11:47,968 --> 01:11:50,636
Have you got
the stocking masks?

1054
01:11:50,737 --> 01:11:52,505
No, but I got these.

1055
01:11:55,876 --> 01:11:59,612
I'm the clown, and you're
the big, bad wolf.

1056
01:12:03,584 --> 01:12:07,052
All right. You're the clown,
and I'm the big, bad wolf.

1057
01:12:31,077 --> 01:12:32,979
They're here, sir.
They're here.

1058
01:12:33,079 --> 01:12:36,916
Keep talking to me.
I can't see anything.

1059
01:12:49,262 --> 01:12:53,666
That, unless I'm mistaken,
is grandpa.

1060
01:12:53,767 --> 01:12:56,468
Longnecker, I can't see
out of this thing!

1061
01:12:58,739 --> 01:13:02,542
All right.
Keep your eyes peeled.

1062
01:13:02,643 --> 01:13:05,611
There are two fellas, sir. One
of them is getting out right now.

1063
01:13:05,712 --> 01:13:07,813
He's com-
he's coming towards you, sir.

1064
01:13:07,915 --> 01:13:10,016
They-they seem
to be wearing masks.

1065
01:13:10,116 --> 01:13:13,485
Yes, sir, it's masks of the
common Halloween variety, sir.

1066
01:13:17,724 --> 01:13:20,492
It's another limousine,
sir.

1067
01:13:24,431 --> 01:13:28,133
Yipe. Sir,
it's J.W. Osborne.

1068
01:13:37,711 --> 01:13:40,345
Afternoon,
sergeant turner.

1069
01:13:40,447 --> 01:13:42,014
There's two grandfathers!

1070
01:13:42,115 --> 01:13:43,716
It's a trap!

1071
01:13:43,817 --> 01:13:46,018
Move!

1072
01:13:46,119 --> 01:13:49,354
Stop!

1073
01:13:52,626 --> 01:13:54,359
Longnecker,
they're getting away!

1074
01:13:54,461 --> 01:13:56,328
Uh, red alert!
Red alert!

1075
01:13:56,429 --> 01:13:59,531
This is C.Q. To
all units. Red alert.

1076
01:13:59,633 --> 01:14:02,735
Look!

1077
01:14:14,447 --> 01:14:16,482
Carolyn!

1078
01:14:35,902 --> 01:14:38,370
What? What-
who are you?

1079
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:42,141
- I want to explain-
- come on, sergeant.

1080
01:14:42,242 --> 01:14:44,276
- We'll get 'em.
- Get 'em, you dummy?

1081
01:14:44,377 --> 01:14:46,612
You haven't even got me.

1082
01:14:46,713 --> 01:14:49,682
Hold this.

1083
01:14:49,783 --> 01:14:51,917
That's not mine.

1084
01:14:52,019 --> 01:14:54,987
We're taking your car.
Longnecker, get in!

1085
01:14:55,088 --> 01:14:57,757
call the C.P. And start
plan A.X., priority four west.

1086
01:14:57,858 --> 01:15:00,359
- Seal the grids as outlined
and be sure- - get in!

1087
01:15:00,460 --> 01:15:02,261
Yes, sir.

1088
01:15:02,362 --> 01:15:05,397
- Something I must explain-
- it's a police matter.

1089
01:15:05,498 --> 01:15:08,768
Don't worry. We'll get him.

1090
01:15:08,869 --> 01:15:10,703
That's what
I'm afraid of.

1091
01:15:10,804 --> 01:15:13,039
- What are you doing here?
- You've got my kids.

1092
01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:17,076
- That's what I'm doing here.
- Your kids? You're in Hong Kong.

1093
01:15:17,177 --> 01:15:19,879
No, no, no.
That's her, all right.

1094
01:15:19,980 --> 01:15:23,149
She and the kids have both got a way
of climbing into other people's cars.

1095
01:15:23,249 --> 01:15:26,218
<i>- Where are my children?
- Your children are safe, Mrs. Osborne.</i>

1096
01:15:26,319 --> 01:15:28,420
Which is more than I can say
for us right now.

1097
01:15:28,521 --> 01:15:30,923
If it's the money, you'll
get it. We'll pay the ransom.

1098
01:15:31,024 --> 01:15:34,593
Money? Well, that's terrific. Except money
doesn't seem to be all that important right now.

1099
01:15:34,695 --> 01:15:39,065
What do you mean? Are you
the kidnappers or aren't you?

1100
01:15:39,166 --> 01:15:41,967
Well, sort of.

1101
01:15:42,069 --> 01:15:47,006
- Henderson, do you see them?
- I'm looking, sir.

1102
01:15:47,107 --> 01:15:50,009
- there they are.
- Where?

1103
01:15:50,110 --> 01:15:54,847
- You've just passed 'em.
- You just passed 'em. Turn around.

1104
01:16:09,930 --> 01:16:11,630
Where'd they go?

1105
01:16:11,732 --> 01:16:15,634
I don't understand this.
You grab a couple of kids,

1106
01:16:15,736 --> 01:16:18,170
You terrify everybody,
and you're "sort of" kidnappers?

1107
01:16:18,271 --> 01:16:20,606
- Well- - kidnappers have
responsibility too, you know.

1108
01:16:20,707 --> 01:16:22,808
- Responsibility?
- Yes, indeed.

1109
01:16:22,909 --> 01:16:24,810
You're talkin'
about responsibility? You?

1110
01:16:24,911 --> 01:16:28,013
What kind of a mother are you?
You ran all over the world.

1111
01:16:28,115 --> 01:16:31,016
I mean, you can't raise kids
by long distance, you know.

1112
01:16:31,118 --> 01:16:34,386
Or by schoolteachers, or a maid,
or by a grouchy grandfather.

1113
01:16:34,487 --> 01:16:37,356
Or by a Bert. Those kids
are a handful, you know.

1114
01:16:39,893 --> 01:16:42,661
There they are!

1115
01:17:09,923 --> 01:17:12,091
Duck!

1116
01:17:32,378 --> 01:17:34,546
Henderson.
Come in, Henderson.

1117
01:17:34,647 --> 01:17:36,682
<i>uh, sergeant, did you notice
you lost your top?</i>

1118
01:17:36,783 --> 01:17:39,718
Never mind my top!
Did you see the red car?

1119
01:17:39,820 --> 01:17:44,423
Uh, uh
- they're turnin' in at the fish dock, sir.

1120
01:17:44,524 --> 01:17:48,694
All cars, all cars, anyone in the
vicinity, block north end of fish docks.

1121
01:17:48,795 --> 01:17:53,598
Your kids want attention and affection, and
they're gonna get it from anybody they can.

1122
01:17:53,700 --> 01:17:57,402
That's right, even from a couple
of so-called, "sort of" kidnappers.

1123
01:17:57,503 --> 01:17:59,972
What would you know
about raising my children?

1124
01:18:00,073 --> 01:18:05,410
Mrs. Osborne, we have just spent
three straight days with your kids.

1125
01:18:05,511 --> 01:18:08,580
When was the last time
you did the same?

1126
01:18:18,925 --> 01:18:23,095
- There they are!
- Go!

1127
01:18:28,201 --> 01:18:30,336
look out!

1128
01:18:48,121 --> 01:18:51,323
Notify all units.

1129
01:18:51,424 --> 01:18:56,362
All units. All units. Subjects
heading west to grid coordinate 54.

1130
01:18:59,732 --> 01:19:02,334
All units. All units.

1131
01:19:02,435 --> 01:19:04,503
Red car heading west.

1132
01:19:09,809 --> 01:19:12,711
oh.

1133
01:19:12,812 --> 01:19:14,880
What?

1134
01:19:17,117 --> 01:19:20,152
Move!

1135
01:19:24,925 --> 01:19:28,627
Stop! Back up!

1136
01:19:29,963 --> 01:19:32,731
That way.
They went that way.

1137
01:19:49,983 --> 01:19:52,217
No, look!

1138
01:20:11,604 --> 01:20:13,672
Move!

1139
01:20:19,912 --> 01:20:23,182
All units. All units. Does
anybody have them in sight?

1140
01:20:23,283 --> 01:20:25,517
Yes, sir. They're headed
right for my position.

1141
01:20:25,618 --> 01:20:28,753
They're coming down pier 27.
They're headed right towards me.

1142
01:20:28,855 --> 01:20:31,957
Get somebody
to head them off!

1143
01:20:33,193 --> 01:20:35,827
Crane operator!
Crane operator!

1144
01:20:35,928 --> 01:20:38,763
<i>When I say the words,
"drop me," drop me.</i>

1145
01:20:38,865 --> 01:20:40,632
Drop me!

1146
01:20:43,169 --> 01:20:46,738
Not me!
The bucket!

1147
01:21:32,118 --> 01:21:34,853
Start it! Start it!

1148
01:21:39,225 --> 01:21:41,326
Ah.

1149
01:21:59,946 --> 01:22:02,381
Aah!

1150
01:22:04,817 --> 01:22:07,286
Longnecker!

1151
01:22:09,055 --> 01:22:11,623
Get us outta here!

1152
01:22:31,010 --> 01:22:33,412
There they are!

1153
01:22:40,753 --> 01:22:42,454
Step on it!

1154
01:22:53,633 --> 01:22:56,001
Look out!

1155
01:22:57,103 --> 01:22:58,970
Hey!

1156
01:23:15,688 --> 01:23:18,390
Come on, sit up!
Aaah!

1157
01:25:34,827 --> 01:25:36,428
Aah!

1158
01:25:57,483 --> 01:25:59,551
Thank you, Longnecker.

1159
01:25:59,652 --> 01:26:02,220
You're welcome, sir.

1160
01:26:03,856 --> 01:26:05,890
Keep writing.

1161
01:26:05,991 --> 01:26:10,094
"only these are
other kidnappers,

1162
01:26:10,196 --> 01:26:13,264
"and they want
half a million dollars...

1163
01:26:13,366 --> 01:26:15,434
"or our lives. "

1164
01:26:17,670 --> 01:26:19,304
All right.
Read that back to me.

1165
01:26:19,405 --> 01:26:24,710
"dear grandpa, we are being
held by kidnappers.

1166
01:26:24,811 --> 01:26:26,611
"only these are
other kidnappers,

1167
01:26:26,713 --> 01:26:30,782
"and they want half a million
dollars or our lives. "

1168
01:26:30,883 --> 01:26:32,617
Very good.

1169
01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:36,722
P.S. Please do it,
if you love us.

1170
01:26:36,823 --> 01:26:39,424
He'll never go
for that.

1171
01:26:40,393 --> 01:26:43,762
We are in terrible danger.

1172
01:26:46,833 --> 01:26:49,000
All right.
Sign it.

1173
01:26:51,471 --> 01:26:55,707
That's very good. All right,
come on, kids. Let's go.

1174
01:26:55,808 --> 01:26:58,142
This your hat?
Where's your pussycat?

1175
01:26:58,244 --> 01:26:59,511
Where we going?

1176
01:26:59,612 --> 01:27:02,714
- Taking you to a quieter place.
- We can't.

1177
01:27:02,815 --> 01:27:04,115
We gotta wait
for Duke and Bert.

1178
01:27:04,216 --> 01:27:07,886
Forget Duke and Bert.
Come on.

1179
01:27:07,987 --> 01:27:10,355
ha-rah!

1180
01:27:10,456 --> 01:27:13,692
whoa! Whoa!

1181
01:27:14,994 --> 01:27:16,828
- Come on, Jay.
- Duster! Duster!

1182
01:27:16,929 --> 01:27:18,897
- Jay!
- I can't find Duster.

1183
01:27:18,998 --> 01:27:22,000
Come on!
Look out!

1184
01:27:22,101 --> 01:27:25,036
Get the girl!

1185
01:27:27,006 --> 01:27:28,006
Hey!

1186
01:27:28,107 --> 01:27:31,610
You just stay right there.
Don't you move.

1187
01:27:34,079 --> 01:27:35,881
Ow!

1188
01:27:35,981 --> 01:27:39,217
All right. Now where
you gonna go, huh?

1189
01:27:40,453 --> 01:27:42,721
Gotcha!

1190
01:27:55,134 --> 01:27:56,735
wha-

1191
01:27:56,836 --> 01:27:58,770
What's going on?

1192
01:28:00,072 --> 01:28:02,140
Tracy! Tracy!

1193
01:28:03,409 --> 01:28:06,144
- Freddie!
- Big Joe!

1194
01:28:11,918 --> 01:28:13,151
Dummy.

1195
01:28:13,252 --> 01:28:15,119
The children are still up there.

1196
01:28:15,220 --> 01:28:17,055
Never came out
of the building.

1197
01:28:17,156 --> 01:28:19,825
They'll be with us by the time
my daughter-in-law gets home.

1198
01:28:19,926 --> 01:28:21,893
what are you doing?

1199
01:28:21,994 --> 01:28:26,064
Just setting up some more traps
in case big Joe has friends.

1200
01:28:26,165 --> 01:28:27,799
Brat!

1201
01:28:28,768 --> 01:28:31,503
- hey.
- Is it them?

1202
01:28:31,604 --> 01:28:34,773
Yes, but it's
the wrong them.

1203
01:28:34,874 --> 01:28:38,009
grandfather!
It's the old double cross.

1204
01:28:38,110 --> 01:28:42,681
Duke and Bert? Never.
Something must have happened.

1205
01:28:42,782 --> 01:28:47,085
Yeah. Grandfather'll get us,
and we'll never get to mother.

1206
01:28:47,186 --> 01:28:50,188
Oh, yes, we will.

1207
01:29:00,766 --> 01:29:05,336
Don't worry. It's easy.
Just go ahead. Duster!

1208
01:29:07,106 --> 01:29:11,009
Well, Peter, I suppose
we'd best go in.

1209
01:29:11,110 --> 01:29:13,378
Perhaps the little ones
have changed, sir.

1210
01:29:13,479 --> 01:29:15,914
Yes, I have considered
that possibility.

1211
01:29:16,015 --> 01:29:18,182
Maybe I have been
a trifle too harsh.

1212
01:29:18,283 --> 01:29:21,853
After all, I've not really
given them a Chance.

1213
01:29:21,954 --> 01:29:24,556
Who knows? This may be
the beginning of a-

1214
01:29:24,657 --> 01:29:26,491
A whole new relationship.

1215
01:29:27,493 --> 01:29:29,394
Good heavens!

1216
01:29:30,863 --> 01:29:33,197
Mr. Osborne!

1217
01:29:36,068 --> 01:29:39,103
Peter, this is absurd.

1218
01:29:47,312 --> 01:29:48,980
Duster! Duster!

1219
01:29:49,081 --> 01:29:52,183
- Come on, Jay.
- We can't. Not till I find Duster.

1220
01:29:56,789 --> 01:29:58,489
Never mind.
I found him.

1221
01:29:58,591 --> 01:30:02,093
Come back. Hey.
Egg fooyoung waiting for you.

1222
01:30:03,729 --> 01:30:06,531
Hey, is that yours?

1223
01:30:29,989 --> 01:30:32,290
Totaled.

1224
01:30:32,391 --> 01:30:34,459
A whole police car...

1225
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:36,461
Completely totaled.

1226
01:30:36,562 --> 01:30:38,463
Not completely, sir.

1227
01:30:38,564 --> 01:30:40,732
Completely.

1228
01:30:41,934 --> 01:30:44,636
Don't despair, sergeant.
I've picked up a lead.

1229
01:30:44,737 --> 01:30:46,370
- Longnecker, I-
- over the car radio.

1230
01:30:46,472 --> 01:30:49,140
Somebody saw two kids come out
of a garage apartment window.

1231
01:30:49,241 --> 01:30:52,410
- I have the address right here.
= Longnecker!

1232
01:30:52,511 --> 01:30:54,045
Can't you tell
the difference

1233
01:30:54,146 --> 01:30:56,581
Between a genuine clue
and a crank call?

1234
01:30:56,682 --> 01:30:59,150
Yes. Class in the law
of probability at the academy-

1235
01:30:59,251 --> 01:31:01,452
Lecture 10 on crank phone calls.

1236
01:31:01,553 --> 01:31:05,056
One phone call out of 25
may contain a useful clue.

1237
01:31:05,157 --> 01:31:08,026
Now, sir, the way
that I see it, we-

1238
01:31:08,127 --> 01:31:09,560
I'm going back to the station,

1239
01:31:09,662 --> 01:31:12,030
I'm going to change
into some dry clothes,

1240
01:31:12,131 --> 01:31:13,898
And then I'm going
to check on Mr. Osborne.

1241
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:17,035
<i>Then I'm going to try to
forget- mind you, try to forget-</i>

1242
01:31:17,136 --> 01:31:19,671
That you and the academy
ever existed.

1243
01:31:19,772 --> 01:31:22,607
Yes, sir. I think you
have a point there.

1244
01:31:40,492 --> 01:31:43,995
- Get outta here!
- Hey, hey. They gone.

1245
01:31:44,096 --> 01:31:46,097
- Kids are gone. Pretty quick.
- Gone?

1246
01:31:46,198 --> 01:31:49,167
But not quick enough. That skunk
empty out my whole restaurant.

1247
01:31:49,268 --> 01:31:51,402
Did you see which way
they went?

1248
01:31:51,503 --> 01:31:55,774
- Yes, hitch ride on another cement truck.
- Well, let's go! Come on.

1249
01:32:01,814 --> 01:32:05,283
- How far are you going?
- Sepulveda boulevard, honey.

1250
01:32:05,384 --> 01:32:06,517
Does that help you?

1251
01:32:06,618 --> 01:32:09,087
It does if we can get
a bus there to Merlin oaks.

1252
01:32:09,188 --> 01:32:12,691
Merlin oaks? That's
where grandfather lives.

1253
01:32:13,826 --> 01:32:16,260
- Mr. Osborne?
- Yes?

1254
01:32:16,361 --> 01:32:19,230
- My name is big Joe Adamo.
- How do you do.

1255
01:32:19,331 --> 01:32:23,568
How'd you do.
Here, read this.

1256
01:32:23,669 --> 01:32:26,304
Don't be ridiculous, man.
I can't read upside down.

1257
01:32:26,405 --> 01:32:29,574
It says, "we want half a million
dollars," Mr. Osborne.

1258
01:32:29,675 --> 01:32:33,812
Strange. I don't seem to be
able to hear upside down, either.

1259
01:32:37,216 --> 01:32:40,752
= Mr. Osborne? Longnecker, sir.
- Welcome aboard, Longnecker.

1260
01:32:40,853 --> 01:32:42,721
This-
where is he?

1261
01:32:42,822 --> 01:32:45,890
This would-be kidnapper is
demanding half a million dollars.

1262
01:32:49,128 --> 01:32:51,029
A- ha!

1263
01:32:54,666 --> 01:32:58,703
You have the right
to remain silent!

1264
01:32:59,671 --> 01:33:01,039
If you give up that right,

1265
01:33:01,140 --> 01:33:03,942
Anything you say can and
will be used against you.

1266
01:33:23,796 --> 01:33:26,898
If can open one of Duke's safes,
I can open this one.

1267
01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:32,103
Hey, so can I.

1268
01:33:32,204 --> 01:33:35,640
Especially when
it's already open.

1269
01:33:37,609 --> 01:33:40,378
Get the flashlight.

1270
01:33:41,680 --> 01:33:43,782
Don't you move,
Duster.

1271
01:33:52,357 --> 01:33:54,392
There's so much money,
I can't even count it all.

1272
01:33:54,493 --> 01:33:57,328
- Let's not count it. Let's take it.
- We're not taking it.

1273
01:33:57,429 --> 01:34:01,332
We're borrowing it. And just
enough to get us to Hong Kong.

1274
01:34:07,807 --> 01:34:10,441
Come on.

1275
01:34:29,394 --> 01:34:32,096
He's gonna see us.

1276
01:34:43,775 --> 01:34:47,245
Worse than that.
He didn't see us.

1277
01:34:51,650 --> 01:34:54,152
Help! Help!
We're stuck in here!

1278
01:34:54,253 --> 01:34:57,655
- Help!
- Anybody out there? Help!

1279
01:35:05,831 --> 01:35:08,366
- Good evening, Mrs. Osborne.
- Where are the children?

1280
01:35:08,467 --> 01:35:10,902
- The children?
- Tracy! Jay!

1281
01:35:11,003 --> 01:35:12,904
- Didn't you get them?
- No, but we traced them here.

1282
01:35:13,005 --> 01:35:15,940
I'm afraid I haven't seen them.
Where's Mr. Osborne?

1283
01:35:20,079 --> 01:35:22,413
Help!

1284
01:35:25,751 --> 01:35:28,419
- Maybe they're upstairs.
= I don't think so, madam.

1285
01:35:28,520 --> 01:35:31,055
They couldn't possibly have got
in without my seeing them.

1286
01:35:31,156 --> 01:35:34,392
the children!

1287
01:35:37,429 --> 01:35:40,464
Evening, Jameson.

1288
01:35:40,565 --> 01:35:42,700
- Mr. Osborne in?
- Oh, I'm afraid not, sergeant.

1289
01:35:42,801 --> 01:35:45,503
- This is the children's mother.
- How do you do, Mrs. Osborne?

1290
01:35:45,604 --> 01:35:48,873
- I'm sergeant turner.
- How do you do, sergeant?

1291
01:35:48,974 --> 01:35:51,709
Um-

1292
01:35:51,810 --> 01:35:55,346
- Haven't we met before?
- Uh-

1293
01:35:55,447 --> 01:35:57,548
They've been helping me
look for Tracy and Jay.

1294
01:35:57,649 --> 01:36:01,252
I could've sworn I've seen
you somewhere...

1295
01:36:01,353 --> 01:36:03,854
- Recently.
- Recently?

1296
01:36:03,956 --> 01:36:06,524
Well, that's possible.
Yes, yes. Of course.

1297
01:36:06,625 --> 01:36:09,327
We're very good friends
with Mr. -

1298
01:36:09,428 --> 01:36:11,529
- Osborne.
- Osborne.

1299
01:36:11,630 --> 01:36:15,800
We've been corresponding with
him for quite some time now.

1300
01:36:21,773 --> 01:36:23,641
Hey, help!
Someone's in here.

1301
01:36:23,742 --> 01:36:25,476
Help, help!
We're stuck.

1302
01:36:25,577 --> 01:36:29,547
We know that Tracy and Jay hitched a ride
on a cement truck and headed this way.

1303
01:36:29,648 --> 01:36:32,550
How did you know
they were your children?

1304
01:36:34,186 --> 01:36:37,221
W- well, uh, we were
lucky enough to get a clue.

1305
01:36:48,567 --> 01:36:50,701
I still think
we should look upstairs.

1306
01:36:50,802 --> 01:36:53,704
Good idea, and we'll go out and
retrace our steps along the road.

1307
01:36:53,805 --> 01:36:55,673
Right, right.
Who knows?

1308
01:36:55,774 --> 01:37:00,111
The kids might be out there trying to hitch
a ride, and we passed them in the dark.

1309
01:37:00,212 --> 01:37:02,280
Wait.

1310
01:37:03,648 --> 01:37:05,716
I'll go with you.

1311
01:37:07,652 --> 01:37:09,553
Oh, don't you worry,
Mrs. Osborne.

1312
01:37:09,654 --> 01:37:12,357
I don't mean to boast, but if
anybody can pick up that scent-

1313
01:37:19,498 --> 01:37:22,000
That isn't exactly
the scent I meant.

1314
01:37:22,101 --> 01:37:24,268
A skunk!

1315
01:37:24,370 --> 01:37:28,072
yes, and
inside the house, madam.

1316
01:37:31,910 --> 01:37:34,312
<i>The children are here.</i>

1317
01:37:34,413 --> 01:37:36,481
Come on.

1318
01:37:42,454 --> 01:37:46,190
- What's behind this wall?
- Mr. Osborne's safe.

1319
01:37:46,291 --> 01:37:49,660
- Can you open it?
- Well, I can open the panel.

1320
01:37:52,464 --> 01:37:55,266
- Me?
- Uh, yes.

1321
01:37:56,335 --> 01:37:58,736
Oh, yeah, yeah.
It's big enough.

1322
01:37:58,837 --> 01:38:01,939
- There's somebody out there!
- It's probably grandfather.

1323
01:38:02,041 --> 01:38:06,310
So? Who cares? For the first time
in my life, I'd be glad to see him.

1324
01:38:11,050 --> 01:38:13,117
- We're in here. Help.
- Help.

1325
01:38:15,820 --> 01:38:19,390
- It's them. They're in there.
- Tracy!

1326
01:38:19,491 --> 01:38:22,760
Jay!

1327
01:38:22,861 --> 01:38:25,829
Tracy! Jay!

1328
01:38:25,931 --> 01:38:29,367
- I don't think they can hear you in there.
- How do we get them out?

1329
01:38:29,468 --> 01:38:31,969
Mr. Osborne's the only
who knows the combination.

1330
01:38:32,071 --> 01:38:35,706
How long will the air
last in here?

1331
01:38:37,409 --> 01:38:41,045
Well, it looks to be about,
uh, 72 inches high...

1332
01:38:41,146 --> 01:38:43,548
By, uh, say roughly
48 inches wide.

1333
01:38:43,648 --> 01:38:46,317
These safes are usually
30, 36 inches deep.

1334
01:38:46,418 --> 01:38:51,255
- Uh, you seem to know quite a bit about safes.
- It's just a guess, sergeant.

1335
01:38:51,356 --> 01:38:54,292
The air.
How long will it last?

1336
01:38:54,393 --> 01:38:58,362
I'd say 20 minutes. Probably
less. Certainly no more.

1337
01:38:58,464 --> 01:39:00,231
Someone has got
to find Mr. Osborne,

1338
01:39:00,332 --> 01:39:02,366
Get the combination
to that safe, and quickly.

1339
01:39:02,468 --> 01:39:04,001
Haven't you heard
from him at all?

1340
01:39:04,103 --> 01:39:08,739
No, madam. He's probably
hung up somewhere.

1341
01:39:08,840 --> 01:39:11,542
I'll have headquarters put out
an all-points bulletin.

1342
01:39:11,643 --> 01:39:14,378
- Where's the phone?
- Here, sergeant.

1343
01:39:15,680 --> 01:39:17,548
Thank you.

1344
01:39:17,649 --> 01:39:21,852
put out an all-points
bulletin on a J.W. Osborne.

1345
01:39:21,953 --> 01:39:23,621
It's a Harkness.

1346
01:39:23,722 --> 01:39:26,857
It's old, but they're still tough
to open, even with the tools.

1347
01:39:26,958 --> 01:39:29,760
For the best,
I'll give you seven-to-five...

1348
01:39:29,861 --> 01:39:31,962
You can crack it
well inside of 20 minutes.

1349
01:39:32,063 --> 01:39:35,500
Twenty minutes,
followed by 20 years.

1350
01:39:36,568 --> 01:39:38,336
- Do you think they'll find him?
- They'll try.

1351
01:39:38,437 --> 01:39:40,505
What do we do now?
Just wait?

1352
01:39:40,606 --> 01:39:42,507
Can't use the
explosive, boys.

1353
01:39:42,608 --> 01:39:45,075
Not with those children
in there. It's too risky.

1354
01:39:45,177 --> 01:39:47,578
Then how are we going
to get them out?

1355
01:39:47,679 --> 01:39:49,647
Only one man I know
could open that safe,

1356
01:39:49,748 --> 01:39:52,216
But I've never been able
to lay my hands on him.

1357
01:39:52,317 --> 01:39:55,919
What, are we helpless?
My children are in there.

1358
01:39:56,021 --> 01:39:58,122
all right. Give me
a Chance to think.

1359
01:40:03,728 --> 01:40:06,531
I know something
about safes.

1360
01:40:09,100 --> 01:40:12,637
I used to work
for a safe company.

1361
01:40:12,737 --> 01:40:16,474
Maybe I can take
a crack at opening that,

1362
01:40:17,942 --> 01:40:20,478
if it's all right
with you, sergeant.

1363
01:41:05,857 --> 01:41:09,260
Boy, it sure is hot
in here.

1364
01:41:09,361 --> 01:41:11,596
What's taking grandfather
so long?

1365
01:41:11,697 --> 01:41:13,598
I don't know, Jay.

1366
01:41:13,699 --> 01:41:16,133
But think positively.

1367
01:41:19,003 --> 01:41:21,405
I'll, uh-
I'll open a window.

1368
01:41:21,506 --> 01:41:23,541
I'll do it, sergeant.

1369
01:41:23,642 --> 01:41:26,677
I can't hear it.
There's too much oil.

1370
01:41:32,651 --> 01:41:35,052
Here's something
interesting.

1371
01:41:35,153 --> 01:41:38,289
It's like a doctor's bag
or something.

1372
01:41:44,663 --> 01:41:48,666
Maybe there's something in here
that's useful in opening a safe.

1373
01:41:51,903 --> 01:41:55,038
Yeah, maybe there is,
sergeant.

1374
01:42:36,080 --> 01:42:40,117
Boy, there isn't
much air in here.

1375
01:42:45,557 --> 01:42:47,625
I'm getting static.

1376
01:42:52,431 --> 01:42:55,533
We'll give it
a try, anyway.

1377
01:43:11,550 --> 01:43:13,884
I'm awful tired.

1378
01:43:15,954 --> 01:43:18,723
Try to stay awake,
Jay.

1379
01:43:23,061 --> 01:43:25,763
That's the first one.

1380
01:43:32,738 --> 01:43:35,305
I can hardly breathe.

1381
01:43:39,478 --> 01:43:42,513
If grandfather ever
gets us out of here,

1382
01:43:42,614 --> 01:43:45,483
I'm gonna be
a lot nicer to him.

1383
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:05,503
Okay, that's
the second one.

1384
01:44:06,405 --> 01:44:09,006
You're gonna make it,
Duke.

1385
01:44:11,976 --> 01:44:13,377
Not with this one.

1386
01:44:13,478 --> 01:44:15,713
It just shorted out
completely.

1387
01:44:17,382 --> 01:44:19,784
Can it be fixed?

1388
01:44:19,885 --> 01:44:22,453
There's no time.

1389
01:44:25,524 --> 01:44:30,761
Now, be quiet. Don't breathe.
Don't even move a muscle.

1390
01:44:42,106 --> 01:44:45,676
I'm sorry.

1391
01:45:34,493 --> 01:45:37,495
I think I've got it,
but I'm not sure.

1392
01:45:46,738 --> 01:45:49,039
Duke!

1393
01:45:49,140 --> 01:45:52,476
- You did it!
- yea!

1394
01:45:53,712 --> 01:45:56,747
Mom!

1395
01:45:56,848 --> 01:46:00,818
- Oh, darling.
- Mom! What are you doing here?

1396
01:46:00,919 --> 01:46:02,820
I should have
been here all the time.

1397
01:46:02,921 --> 01:46:05,455
We really missed you, mom.

1398
01:46:05,557 --> 01:46:08,526
Boy, this is the best vacation
I've ever had.

1399
01:46:08,627 --> 01:46:10,828
Duster!

1400
01:46:11,897 --> 01:46:14,899
Duster. Duster did it.
Duster saved our lives.

1401
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:18,702
yes. Well,
good for Duster.

1402
01:46:18,803 --> 01:46:21,505
you know, mom, he's
the neatest pet I've ever had.

1403
01:46:21,606 --> 01:46:22,773
Come on, Duster.

1404
01:46:22,874 --> 01:46:24,775
Sergeant.

1405
01:46:24,876 --> 01:46:26,710
Yeah.

1406
01:46:26,811 --> 01:46:30,380
I wanna compliment you
on your skill.

1407
01:46:30,481 --> 01:46:34,051
I said there was only one man I could
think of who could open that safe.

1408
01:46:34,152 --> 01:46:37,988
- Yep.
- Apparently I was wrong.

1409
01:46:38,089 --> 01:46:40,758
There are two.

1410
01:46:44,328 --> 01:46:47,031
Anyway, I understand
the other gentleman is retired.

1411
01:46:47,131 --> 01:46:49,266
Oh, yes,
as a matter of fact.

1412
01:46:49,367 --> 01:46:51,669
If it's the same man
I'm thinking of,

1413
01:46:51,770 --> 01:46:54,204
He has retired.
Permanently.

1414
01:47:09,087 --> 01:47:12,189
no, Dave,
listen, I assure you,

1415
01:47:12,290 --> 01:47:13,791
My decision is final.

1416
01:47:13,892 --> 01:47:16,560
As soon as the kids are out of
school, we're all moving out here.

1417
01:47:16,661 --> 01:47:20,430
I sure wish I had the
grass-cutting concession here.

1418
01:47:20,531 --> 01:47:23,400
You know, maybe
I'll take up gardening.

1419
01:47:23,501 --> 01:47:26,470
Out in the fresh air, close to
the soil. It's good for the nerves.

1420
01:47:26,571 --> 01:47:29,406
Yeah.

1421
01:47:29,507 --> 01:47:32,610
It's terrific
for your hay fever too.

1422
01:47:32,711 --> 01:47:36,747
As soon as grandfather gives you
your loan, you'll have a new garage.

1423
01:47:37,849 --> 01:47:42,419
Yeah, well, uh, Tracy,
I been thinking about that,

1424
01:47:42,520 --> 01:47:46,056
I'd feel kinda funny about asking
your grandfather for a loan.

1425
01:47:46,157 --> 01:47:48,358
You don't have to.
I already have.

1426
01:47:49,360 --> 01:47:51,762
- You did?
- A-and he okayed it?

1427
01:47:51,863 --> 01:47:57,835
Why not? Jay and I are getting
along great with him these days.

1428
01:47:59,270 --> 01:48:02,439
uh-oh.

1429
01:48:04,042 --> 01:48:06,076
Well, there goes the garage.

1430
01:48:07,278 --> 01:48:10,247
Oh, boy.

1431
01:48:10,348 --> 01:48:13,517
- Well, you blew it again, Jay.
- I didn't blow it. He did.

1432
01:48:13,618 --> 01:48:15,485
Oh, good heavens.

1433
01:48:15,586 --> 01:48:17,755
I was certain I had
the perfect trajectory.

1434
01:48:17,856 --> 01:48:19,356
You, sir?

1435
01:48:19,457 --> 01:48:22,026
Don't panic. It's just
one more crystal chandelier.

1436
01:48:22,127 --> 01:48:25,629
I told Duke and Bert you said
"okay" about the loan, grandfather.

1437
01:48:25,730 --> 01:48:28,532
Yes. Right, fine. Let's see, what
is the next thing on the agenda?

1438
01:48:28,633 --> 01:48:31,234
- Ah, judo.
- Uh, Mr. Osborne.

1439
01:48:31,335 --> 01:48:34,304
I can't tell you how much
we appreciate that loan.

1440
01:48:34,405 --> 01:48:37,875
But it has got to be on a
strictly nonpersonal basis.

1441
01:48:37,976 --> 01:48:40,944
I do agree. It should be a note.
Legally correct, duly signed.

1442
01:48:41,046 --> 01:48:43,246
- So there can be no misunderstanding.
- Absolutely.

1443
01:48:43,347 --> 01:48:46,483
- What should that rate
of interest be?

1444
01:48:46,584 --> 01:48:51,454
Uh, you don't happen to have
any relatives in buffalo, do you?

1445
01:48:51,556 --> 01:48:53,423
Not that I can
recall, no.

1446
01:48:53,524 --> 01:48:57,161
You two gentlemen drop by the bank in the
morning and we'll wrap the whole thing up.

1447
01:48:57,261 --> 01:49:00,530
- Come along, Jay. Judo time.
- I-I'll be careful, grandpa.

1448
01:49:01,866 --> 01:49:03,867
I hope Jay doesn't get
carried away.

1449
01:49:03,968 --> 01:49:07,004
I hope your grandfather
doesn't get carried away.

1450
01:49:10,641 --> 01:49:14,178
yeah. Oh, yeah.

1451
01:49:18,583 --> 01:49:19,717
I think I'm gonna like

1452
01:49:19,818 --> 01:49:22,619
The idea of this family
of yours living out here.

1453
01:49:22,721 --> 01:49:24,588
So am I.

1454
01:49:24,689 --> 01:49:26,590
it'll be very convenient.

1455
01:49:26,691 --> 01:49:28,158
For instance,

1456
01:49:28,259 --> 01:49:31,328
If somebody wanted to take
somebody else to the movies,

1457
01:49:31,429 --> 01:49:34,064
Then Bert could stay here
and baby-sit us.

1458
01:49:34,165 --> 01:49:36,100
ha-rah!

1459
01:49:37,535 --> 01:49:40,637
I think Jay
won another match.

1460
01:49:42,006 --> 01:49:45,642
I'll get Dr. Butterworth
on the telephone.

1461
01:49:52,583 --> 01:49:55,552
there we are.

1462
01:49:55,653 --> 01:49:58,055
Jay!

1463
01:49:58,156 --> 01:50:00,090
Oh. Oh, boy.

1464
01:50:00,191 --> 01:50:02,025
You should've seen it, Tracy.

1465
01:50:02,127 --> 01:50:04,394
One second I had grandfather
in a wristlock,

1466
01:50:04,495 --> 01:50:07,831
- And the next second I was in the pond.
- It's all in the balance.

1467
01:50:07,932 --> 01:50:09,900
- I didn't hurt you, I trust?
- Of course not.

1468
01:50:10,001 --> 01:50:13,303
You know, I used to be a judo
champion in the armed service.

1469
01:50:13,404 --> 01:50:16,073
- A real champion?
- A real champion.

1470
01:50:16,174 --> 01:50:18,909
Boy, I think
you're super, grandpa.

1471
01:50:19,010 --> 01:50:21,979
Jameson, do you hear that?
Jay thinks I'm super.

1472
01:50:22,080 --> 01:50:25,215
- I think you're super too.
- Oh, thank you, darling.

1473
01:50:25,316 --> 01:50:29,253
Know something? I think from now on, we
three are going to have a lot of fun together.

1474
01:50:29,353 --> 01:50:31,721
- I think so too.
- Me too.

1475
01:50:31,823 --> 01:50:34,557
What did you do after I had you
in that wristlock?

1476
01:50:34,659 --> 01:50:36,493
Come down to the mat,
and I'll show you.

1477
01:50:36,594 --> 01:50:38,561
I'm bigger than you, so use
my weight to help yourself.

1478
01:50:38,663 --> 01:50:41,631
Now, hold my wrist there.
The other hand.

1479
01:50:41,732 --> 01:50:44,634
Now, bend your knees.
One, two-

1480
01:50:44,735 --> 01:50:47,871
No, wait a minute. One, two.
Now, you stand there.

1481
01:50:47,972 --> 01:50:51,374
Imagine that I go,
"whoo. "

1482
01:50:54,578 --> 01:50:56,814
now we're even.
