00:01:20,193 --> 00:01:22,559
<i> Up the creeks and down the bayous</i>

00:01:22,662 --> 00:01:24,926

Now, Davie, you change those clothes
before you put Babe away.

42
00:03:18,612 --> 00:03:20,170
Now, who's this?

43
00:03:33,827 --> 00:03:38,389
Miss Effie, Miss Lou, Davie.

44
00:03:38,465 --> 00:03:40,330
Gonna be another hot one.

45
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,698
You made a mighty long ride to tell us

46
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:45,670
something that we already know,
Sheriff Coffey.

47
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:49,470
l'm afraid l won't have to ride
so far next time.

48
00:03:52,345 --> 00:03:55,280
We're looking for your black, Ben Woods.

49
00:03:55,348 --> 00:03:57,316
Ben hasn't been back here to Grassy

50
00:03:57,417 --> 00:04:01,046
since he went off to the war
with Captain Bernie.

51
00:04:01,121 --> 00:04:05,956
Mr. Catrell here says Ben
run off with some of his belongings.

52
00:04:06,026 --> 00:04:10,520
- That makes Mr. Catrell a liar.
- Hold on there.

53
00:04:10,597 --> 00:04:16,558
lf Ben shows up,
please tell him l'd like to see him.

54
00:04:21,741 --> 00:04:25,233
What'd he mean,
he won't have so far to ride next time?

55
00:04:25,312 --> 00:04:28,543
Oh, he's heard talk
that we might lose this place.

56
00:04:31,017 --> 00:04:33,713
You shouldn't talk that way
in front of the boy.

57
00:04:33,787 --> 00:04:35,618
Oh, mercy.

58
00:04:38,525 --> 00:04:41,494
We'll find a way to keep Grassy, Davie.

59
00:04:48,735 --> 00:04:50,862
l'd better get Babe out of the sun.

60
00:04:50,937 --> 00:04:54,498
And then you're gonna study scriptures.
Now, go along, Thaddeus.

61
00:04:54,574 --> 00:04:57,941
Go on, now. l know you're there.

62
00:04:58,011 --> 00:05:01,572
Oh, come on. Thad needs me to help him
dig bait. We're going fishing.

63
00:05:01,681 --> 00:05:03,615
Not today, you're not.

64
00:05:03,683 --> 00:05:06,379
Miss Millington said
you stumbled all through lsaiah.

65
00:05:08,588 --> 00:05:11,489
- Doesn't that boy have a home?
- Now, go along now.

66
00:05:11,558 --> 00:05:16,120
He's got a secret tree house and Mr.
Stark lets him sleep in his root cellar,

67
00:05:16,196 --> 00:05:18,528
but he has to work a bit first.

68
00:05:23,937 --> 00:05:25,905
Thad?

69
00:05:29,376 --> 00:05:30,741
Ben!

70
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,861
Ben! Oh, Ben!

71
00:05:49,929 --> 00:05:51,794
Oh!

72
00:05:51,865 --> 00:05:54,163
- Davie.
- Why didn't you knock at the door?

73
00:05:54,234 --> 00:05:56,498
Shh!

74
00:05:56,569 --> 00:05:59,231
- l couldn't take the chance.
- What's wrong, Ben?

75
00:05:59,305 --> 00:06:02,638
- You in some kind of trouble?
- lt's treasure, Davie. Gold.

76
00:06:02,709 --> 00:06:06,236
Gold your daddy buried
to keep Spangler from getting it.

77
00:06:06,312 --> 00:06:08,177
Well, who's Spangler?

78
00:06:12,385 --> 00:06:14,615
The devil hisself.

79
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:22,455
Now, what's all this talk
about a treasure?

80
00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:25,896
Well, we had just
put down cargo at Mobile.

81
00:06:25,965 --> 00:06:29,924
lt got paid in gold 'cause that was
the only money worth anything by then.

82
00:06:30,036 --> 00:06:33,335
Captain Bernie decided
to make one more run to the Bahamas.

83
00:06:33,406 --> 00:06:36,773
That's when the Cumberland spots us
and starts closing in on us.

84
00:06:36,876 --> 00:06:39,970
Was that that Yankee gunboat
that sunk the Flora Bee?

85
00:06:40,046 --> 00:06:43,379
Mm-hm. Spangler's boat.
But Captain Bernie was smart.

86
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:47,318
He took the Flora Bee in shallow water
where the Cumberland couldn't go.

87
00:06:47,387 --> 00:06:50,823
- And then he hide that gold.
- Then it's still buried somewhere?

88
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:55,327
Yes, ma'am. Way over yonder in Florida.
And l gotta get Jim Bernie...

89
00:06:55,395 --> 00:06:58,660
Jim Bernie.
What do you want with that rapscallion?

90
00:06:59,365 --> 00:07:03,131
Captain Bernie told me his brother
would help me get the gold for Davie

91
00:07:03,203 --> 00:07:04,932
so Davie wouldn't lose Grassy.

92
00:07:05,004 --> 00:07:08,633
(Miss Effie) Jim Bernie never did
finish anything in his life.

93
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:10,938
Do you need money, Ben?

94
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:15,242
- Well, l ain't got none, Miss Lou.
- Well, we can let you have a little.

95
00:07:15,315 --> 00:07:17,875
Lou, a very little.

96
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:26,681
Now, just where is this gold
supposed to be?

97
00:07:28,027 --> 00:07:33,090
There was a map that Captain Bernie
sent home before he died.

98
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:35,930
l never saw a map in Clay's things.

99
00:07:36,002 --> 00:07:39,233
lt's in the book.

100
00:07:39,305 --> 00:07:42,570
The one he was always reading.

101
00:07:42,642 --> 00:07:44,610
Of course.

102
00:07:45,712 --> 00:07:49,546
There's nothing on this page
except the little that Homer wrote.

103
00:07:49,616 --> 00:07:53,916
l ain't lying. That's what Captain
Bernie told me before he died in prison.

104
00:07:53,987 --> 00:07:58,924
- l swear to the Lord on that.
- You can see there's no map there.

105
00:08:01,294 --> 00:08:05,594
And who was that man
who came looking for you today?

106
00:08:05,665 --> 00:08:08,998
One of Spangler's men.
They think l know where the treasure is.

107
00:08:09,068 --> 00:08:12,231
Captain Bernie won't tell me.
He says it's for my own good.

108
00:08:12,338 --> 00:08:15,774
Hey, look. Maybe you're meant
to hold it over the lamp like this.

109
00:08:17,277 --> 00:08:19,438
Look, there's some writing.

110
00:08:19,512 --> 00:08:22,003
Matecumbe Key.

111
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:26,950
That's an X.
That must be where the treasure is.

112
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,455
Captain said he buried it under a tree,
but he don't say where.

113
00:08:29,455 --> 00:08:30,353
Captain said he buried it under a tree,
but he don't say where.

114
00:08:50,376 --> 00:08:54,278
- Did you hear anything, Effie?
- Oh, just the wind.

115
00:08:56,249 --> 00:09:00,015
- What on earth...?
- lt's Spangler! l knew it!

116
00:09:22,275 --> 00:09:24,835
lt's him.

117
00:09:32,352 --> 00:09:35,913
What are you doing in this house?

118
00:09:36,022 --> 00:09:38,354
We're after Bernie's black.

119
00:09:38,424 --> 00:09:41,484
Don't tell us he isn't here
'cause we know he is.

120
00:09:41,561 --> 00:09:45,463
My sister and my nephew and myself
live in this house,

121
00:09:45,531 --> 00:09:47,897
and you have awakened us
from a sound sleep.

122
00:09:47,967 --> 00:09:50,936
Now get out of here.

123
00:09:51,004 --> 00:09:53,905
Do you make it a habit
of sleeping in the attic?

124
00:10:03,149 --> 00:10:05,709
They're coming up. Barricade the door.

125
00:10:05,785 --> 00:10:08,345
Davie, come here. Come on.

126
00:10:10,456 --> 00:10:12,356
Davie!

127
00:10:13,259 --> 00:10:14,726
Davie!

128
00:10:14,794 --> 00:10:17,319
All right. Effie, get out of the way.

129
00:10:17,397 --> 00:10:19,365
- Watch your head.
- Here we go.

130
00:10:24,137 --> 00:10:26,264
- Ben!
- Take him, Ben!

131
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:29,035
- Ben!
- Come on.

132
00:10:29,108 --> 00:10:31,076
Ben, the map!

133
00:10:37,917 --> 00:10:39,885
Break it down.

134
00:11:00,139 --> 00:11:02,903
- Effie, l can't!
- l'll get 'em.

135
00:11:30,169 --> 00:11:32,535
Davie! Davie!

136
00:11:39,178 --> 00:11:40,338
Ben?

137
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,358
The map.

138
00:11:56,295 --> 00:11:58,263
Ben?

139
00:12:00,366 --> 00:12:03,233
- Ben?
- Spread out! Don't let 'em escape!

140
00:12:03,302 --> 00:12:05,463
Round the side there. Check them bushes.

141
00:12:06,372 --> 00:12:08,465
Come on.

142
00:12:12,712 --> 00:12:15,044
You two down the hauler. Check that.

143
00:12:26,092 --> 00:12:28,060
Well, find those boys.

144
00:12:44,977 --> 00:12:47,878
- Giddyap! Giddyap!
- Yah!

145
00:13:39,866 --> 00:13:43,825
Ain't nothing up ahead, captain.
They must have turned off somewhere.

146
00:13:48,241 --> 00:13:51,733
- What'd them men want with you, Davie?
- l can't tell you now.

147
00:13:54,714 --> 00:13:57,046
Quick, help me turn this boat over.

148
00:13:57,116 --> 00:13:59,880
- Can l come with you?
- l got a long way to go, Thad.

149
00:13:59,952 --> 00:14:02,512
Who have l got to go frogging with
if you've gone?

150
00:14:02,588 --> 00:14:05,148
And we can't call
a secret meeting at the hideout

151
00:14:05,224 --> 00:14:07,283
with just one member present.

152
00:14:09,195 --> 00:14:12,756
All right. Help me shove off
and climb in.

153
00:14:14,233 --> 00:14:16,201
Look.

154
00:14:18,971 --> 00:14:21,303
This is old man Snyder's boat.

155
00:14:21,374 --> 00:14:25,003
We'll pay for it when we get back...
if we get back.

156
00:14:38,324 --> 00:14:40,884
That's them. Took to the river.

157
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,487
They have to come ashore... sometime.

158
00:14:51,571 --> 00:14:54,734
You keep reading that map,
you're gonna wear it out.

159
00:14:54,807 --> 00:14:56,968
l'm just studying it.

160
00:14:57,043 --> 00:15:01,707
You really think you can find
that treasure way down there in Florida?

161
00:15:01,781 --> 00:15:04,807
lt's a long way from Kentucky.

162
00:15:04,884 --> 00:15:07,580
l don't know, but l'm sure gonna try.

163
00:15:07,653 --> 00:15:11,783
Maybe there's enough gold to keep the
carpetbaggers from getting our place.

164
00:15:11,857 --> 00:15:14,553
Where would you live
if they was to get Grassy?

165
00:15:14,627 --> 00:15:18,085
l keep thinking what would happen
to Aunt Effie and Aunt Lou.

166
00:15:18,164 --> 00:15:19,825
They've always lived there.

167
00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:24,427
Your Aunt Effie and Aunt Lou'd sure be
surprised if you was to find it.

168
00:15:25,838 --> 00:15:29,274
Davie, if those men catch up with us,

169
00:15:29,342 --> 00:15:31,902
they might kill us, same as Ben.

170
00:15:32,945 --> 00:15:35,505
l still wouldn't tell 'em
where the treasure is.

171
00:15:35,581 --> 00:15:40,541
- Not even if they was gonna kill ya?
- They couldn't make me.

172
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,588
Me neither, Davie.

173
00:15:43,489 --> 00:15:45,457
l liked Ben.

174
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:50,525
Let's take a sacred oath.
We'll never tell.

175
00:15:50,596 --> 00:15:53,030
- No matter what they do.
- No matter what.

176
00:16:00,206 --> 00:16:02,538
Quick, Thad! lt's a sternwheeler.

177
00:16:02,608 --> 00:16:07,477
lt's like a big plantation house
just floating down the river.

178
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:12,508
- You think they'll let us on there?
- Why not? We got money. Come on.

179
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:23,988
- How much is it as far as Friars Point?
- What class, son?

180
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,030
Sir?

181
00:16:25,131 --> 00:16:29,295
lt's five dollars for cabin class, three
for boiler, two dollars for the deck.

182
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:42,711
Two decks, please, for me and him.

183
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:47,813
There you go, boys. Straight back there,
right through the passage.

184
00:16:47,887 --> 00:16:50,447
Any spot that looks comfortable.
Howdy, folks.

185
00:16:50,556 --> 00:16:53,423
ls that where he lives,
Friars Point?

186
00:16:53,492 --> 00:16:55,460
Uncle Jim never stays anywhere long,

187
00:16:55,561 --> 00:16:58,394
but that's where he was
last time he wrote Aunt Effie.

188
00:16:58,464 --> 00:17:02,400
- She calls him a black sheep.
- You think your uncle'll help you?

189
00:17:02,468 --> 00:17:04,834
Sure, if he's not too busy.

190
00:17:06,038 --> 00:17:08,529
l guess my Uncle Jim
can do just about anything.

191
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:11,371
- Anything?
- That's what l said, anything.

192
00:17:18,951 --> 00:17:21,920
Suppose he meant here?

193
00:17:21,987 --> 00:17:24,615
l've slept on worse than this before.

194
00:17:30,463 --> 00:17:32,021
Hey!

195
00:17:37,169 --> 00:17:41,196
Little boys who know
what's good for them

196
00:17:41,273 --> 00:17:46,540
do not sit on bales of cotton
spying on ladies what's hiding.

197
00:17:46,612 --> 00:17:49,479
- We wasn't.
- We didn't even know you were here.

198
00:17:49,548 --> 00:17:52,517
Just a minute. l'm Captain Boomer.
Your fares, please.

199
00:17:52,618 --> 00:17:55,246
l believe my sister's aboard this boat.

200
00:17:55,321 --> 00:17:57,687
Not having had the pleasure,
l couldn't say.

201
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:00,884
She's about five foot six.
She's wearing a wedding dress.

202
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,895
No one wearing a wedding dress
boarded this boat.

203
00:18:03,963 --> 00:18:08,024
She wouldn't buy a ticket from
the clerk, you fool. She's a stowaway.

204
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,126
She hasn't got a cent.
She's trying to get to New Orleans.

205
00:18:11,203 --> 00:18:14,036
lf l find her, she'll be put ashore
like any stowaway.

206
00:18:14,106 --> 00:18:17,371
Meanwhile, you have exactly two minutes
before we cast off.

207
00:18:17,443 --> 00:18:21,174
Not till l've found that handful,
you're not.

208
00:18:21,247 --> 00:18:25,547
- ls the big ugly one your husband?
- No. And he's not going to be.

209
00:18:25,618 --> 00:18:28,086
l don't care how much money
that Yankee's got.

210
00:18:28,154 --> 00:18:32,454
They come looking for you in here,
they're gonna find you for sure.

211
00:18:32,525 --> 00:18:35,016
l know.
We'll hide you in with the animals.

212
00:18:38,631 --> 00:18:42,294
- l couldn't.
- lf you don't, you gonna get married.

213
00:18:43,769 --> 00:18:46,101
Lauriette might have had
a change of heart.

214
00:18:46,172 --> 00:18:50,905
Nonsense. She's nervous. Women
are like that on their wedding day.

215
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:57,911
Did you see a lady in a wedding dress
come through here? Answer me.

216
00:18:57,983 --> 00:19:00,952
What would a lady be doing down here?
And let go of my arm!

217
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:04,387
We should get back to the guests
and explain the postponement.

218
00:19:04,457 --> 00:19:06,618
To blazes with the guests!

219
00:19:12,665 --> 00:19:14,997
What about back there?

220
00:19:23,175 --> 00:19:26,611
Most brides would be
rather conspicuous among the livestock.

221
00:19:28,047 --> 00:19:30,572
But, then, l have never seen
your sister, sir.

222
00:19:46,432 --> 00:19:48,593
- Look, sir...
- Let's look upstairs.

223
00:19:48,701 --> 00:19:51,261
Not unless you buy passage
as far as Coahoma,

224
00:19:51,337 --> 00:19:54,898
otherwise you're going ashore,
as we're shoving off immediately.

225
00:19:56,008 --> 00:19:59,671
- They're gone.
- Oh.

226
00:19:59,745 --> 00:20:01,508
Oh.

227
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,548
Lord!

228
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:06,916
Something old, something new.

229
00:20:06,986 --> 00:20:11,047
lf you want it, nanny,
it's yours to chew.

230
00:20:14,059 --> 00:20:19,895
l presume... one can get
to the ladies' cabin from here.

231
00:20:24,737 --> 00:20:28,605
lf that don't beat all.
Could at least say good day.

232
00:20:52,998 --> 00:20:55,762
We're gonna get in trouble
for being up here, Davie.

233
00:20:55,834 --> 00:20:58,359
They can always send us downstairs.

234
00:20:58,437 --> 00:21:00,132
Hey, Thad, look!

235
00:21:00,205 --> 00:21:03,299
Hey, ain't that that same lady?

236
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:05,468
Yeah. What's she doing in there?

237
00:21:05,544 --> 00:21:08,809
l'm looking to win it
on the up and up.

238
00:21:08,881 --> 00:21:12,977
Very good, sir. Now, watch closely as
l take two red aces and the baby card.

239
00:21:13,052 --> 00:21:15,816
l pick 'em up slowly,
put 'em down on the table,

240
00:21:15,888 --> 00:21:18,914
as all l want you to do
is to tell me where's the baby?

241
00:21:18,991 --> 00:21:21,551
He picks the middle card.
l'm sorry, sir.

242
00:21:21,627 --> 00:21:24,255
You were close.
lt was right beside the baby card.

243
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:28,061
Don't be afraid to bet. lf you don't
speculate, you can't accumulate.

244
00:21:28,133 --> 00:21:31,364
l don't take bets from paupers,
strippers or grandmothers.

245
00:21:31,437 --> 00:21:35,396
Well, since l'm none of those,
would it be permissible if l bet?

246
00:21:35,474 --> 00:21:39,035
Unless, of course, Captain,
you have some regulations against it.

247
00:21:39,144 --> 00:21:42,113
Of course not. lt's just that
we rarely have the ladies

248
00:21:42,181 --> 00:21:44,945
visit us here on the Texas deck.

249
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:49,009
And... what game is this?

250
00:21:49,088 --> 00:21:52,580
This is a very simple game.
lt's called three-card monte.

251
00:21:52,658 --> 00:21:56,822
l plainly display these three cards,
two red aces and a baby card.

252
00:21:56,929 --> 00:22:00,296
l take 'em and l place them on the table
face down like that.

253
00:22:00,366 --> 00:22:02,334
Then l rearrange them thusly.

254
00:22:02,434 --> 00:22:05,403
This is not a trick or a humbug.
lt's all on the up and up.

255
00:22:05,504 --> 00:22:09,372
The idea of the game is for you to see
if you can pick out the baby card.

256
00:22:09,441 --> 00:22:13,002
And if you pick out the baby card,
if your eye is faster than my hand,

257
00:22:13,078 --> 00:22:14,909
you're gonna take all my money.

258
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,915
Oh, that does look like fun.

259
00:22:17,983 --> 00:22:18,984
How much would you like to bet?
Make it easy on yourself, lady.

260
00:22:18,984 --> 00:22:21,418
How much would you like to bet?
Make it easy on yourself, lady.

261
00:22:21,487 --> 00:22:25,947
Well, l have no idea.
ls 500 dollars enough?

262
00:22:26,025 --> 00:22:29,688
500! She don't have no 500 dollars.

263
00:22:29,762 --> 00:22:32,128
She don't have no five cents.

264
00:22:33,098 --> 00:22:35,328
l'll have to see
the color of your money.

265
00:22:35,401 --> 00:22:40,338
And, remember, them Jeff Davis dollars
don't go very far these days. Ha-ha-ha.

266
00:22:40,406 --> 00:22:43,933
Sir, you are addressing a Southern lady.

267
00:22:44,009 --> 00:22:46,842
l have never had anyone before
question my veracity.

268
00:22:46,912 --> 00:22:49,745
The loser better be able to pay up.

269
00:22:49,815 --> 00:22:53,080
All cheaters and welshers on my boat,

270
00:22:53,152 --> 00:22:56,519
Southern ladies or not,
get put off on a sand bar.

271
00:22:56,588 --> 00:22:59,523
- You see that?
- That must be the baby card.

272
00:22:59,591 --> 00:23:01,752
She'll never find it now.

273
00:23:01,827 --> 00:23:04,489
She gonna be in big trouble
when she can't pay up.

274
00:23:04,563 --> 00:23:07,623
All right, now.
Now you watch real close.

275
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:11,830
l'm gonna do it real slow for you
because you're such a pretty lady.

276
00:23:11,904 --> 00:23:14,270
l'm gonna put 'em down like that
so slow.

277
00:23:14,339 --> 00:23:18,105
All l want you to do is to tell me
where's the baby?

278
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:19,939
Oh.

279
00:23:20,012 --> 00:23:22,845
Oh, well, let me see, now. Um...

280
00:23:22,915 --> 00:23:25,679
That... No. Uh, this one.

281
00:23:25,751 --> 00:23:28,811
Oh, l just can't bring myself to look.

282
00:23:29,621 --> 00:23:32,852
Why don't you turn over
the other two cards?

283
00:23:34,226 --> 00:23:37,059
That's not the way
the game is played, lady.

284
00:23:38,564 --> 00:23:40,998
Well...

285
00:23:41,066 --> 00:23:43,694
lf this is... is an ace!

286
00:23:44,737 --> 00:23:48,696
And if this... is an ace!

287
00:23:48,774 --> 00:23:53,677
Then the third card has to be a baby.
lt's just simple logic, isn't it?

288
00:23:53,746 --> 00:23:59,275
Sir, if l understand the game,
you owe me 500 dollars.

289
00:24:06,825 --> 00:24:09,521
lsn't this exciting?

290
00:24:15,601 --> 00:24:18,502
This diamond ring is worth
well over 1 00 dollars.

291
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:20,731
lt'll more than take care
of the balance.

292
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:24,297
Oh, no. l hate to do that to you.

293
00:24:26,512 --> 00:24:29,640
Course, l'd hate to have you
put off on a sand bar.

294
00:24:31,316 --> 00:24:35,252
Now, why don't we show these gentlemen
the baby card?

295
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,413
No, no, no. We don't have to do that.

296
00:24:38,624 --> 00:24:43,584
Well, gentlemen, game is over. Good day.

297
00:24:46,665 --> 00:24:50,226
Captain, l've been meaning to talk
to you about my accommodations.

298
00:24:50,335 --> 00:24:53,498
l'd like something a little bigger.

299
00:24:53,605 --> 00:24:57,939
Of course. Say, by any chance,
you wouldn't be...

300
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:00,478
No, l wouldn't be.

301
00:25:00,546 --> 00:25:03,037
Bye! Bye! Bye.

302
00:25:03,115 --> 00:25:05,083
Bye now. Bye.

303
00:25:49,394 --> 00:25:52,420
My map! Hey, give me that back!

304
00:25:52,497 --> 00:25:56,058
Give me that! lt's mine! Help! Thief!

305
00:25:56,134 --> 00:25:58,102
No!

306
00:25:58,871 --> 00:26:02,034
Stop! Thief! He's got my money!

307
00:26:04,076 --> 00:26:07,307
Somebody stop him! Help! Help!

308
00:26:07,379 --> 00:26:09,142
He stole my money!

309
00:26:09,214 --> 00:26:13,878
- Robber! Thief!
- Hey, hold on. What are you doing?

310
00:26:18,624 --> 00:26:19,784
Help!

311
00:26:23,662 --> 00:26:26,222
Don't worry! l'm coming!

312
00:26:39,645 --> 00:26:41,806
- Davie! Look out!

313
00:27:06,705 --> 00:27:11,074
Here l am, 50 miles from Scott Junction,

314
00:27:11,176 --> 00:27:14,543
with a dress that looks like
a pot cleaner,

315
00:27:14,646 --> 00:27:17,945
to say nothing of my 400 dollars.

316
00:27:18,016 --> 00:27:20,746
Just floated all away.

317
00:27:20,819 --> 00:27:23,379
And all because of
some cursed quirk of fate

318
00:27:23,488 --> 00:27:26,582
that keeps having me
thrown in with the two of ya.

319
00:27:26,658 --> 00:27:29,092
We were just trying to save you.

320
00:27:29,161 --> 00:27:32,187
Two cannonballs
would have been more help.

321
00:27:32,264 --> 00:27:34,596
What were you two doing
on that boat anyway?

322
00:27:34,666 --> 00:27:39,433
- We were going to a key.
- Down by Florida.

323
00:27:39,504 --> 00:27:42,667
That's all we can tell you.

324
00:27:42,741 --> 00:27:45,266
Now, l've had enough of this nonsense.

325
00:27:46,278 --> 00:27:50,806
Look at me. l want you to look at me
and give me some straight answers.

326
00:27:50,882 --> 00:27:53,612
lf you put on some clothes,
we could look at you.

327
00:27:53,685 --> 00:27:58,179
Well, never mind about that.
What were you two doing on that river?

328
00:28:03,161 --> 00:28:07,325
So we switched to old man Snyder's boat
before Spangler could catch us.

329
00:28:07,399 --> 00:28:11,028
- Spangler?
- The devil hisself.

330
00:28:11,103 --> 00:28:13,071
Do you still have this map?

331
00:28:13,171 --> 00:28:17,130
- The rouster threw it overboard.
- What was it a map of?

332
00:28:17,209 --> 00:28:20,474
- We can't tell you that, ma'am.
- lt's for your own good.

333
00:28:20,545 --> 00:28:23,776
But since you tried to help us
and you lost all your money,

334
00:28:23,849 --> 00:28:27,478
if we find what we're looking for,
we'll see you're amply rewarded.

335
00:28:27,552 --> 00:28:30,578
That's very generous of you.

336
00:28:30,655 --> 00:28:33,624
lf you've never played
that three-card monte before,

337
00:28:33,725 --> 00:28:36,285
how come you know how to win that man?

338
00:28:36,361 --> 00:28:39,194
lf there's one thing
l learned from my brother,

339
00:28:39,264 --> 00:28:42,165
it's how to spot a cheat.

340
00:28:45,504 --> 00:28:47,665
- Howdy.
- Whoa.

341
00:28:50,175 --> 00:28:54,271
- How far is it to the next town?
- Coahoma's seven mile that way.

342
00:28:54,346 --> 00:28:58,646
Seven miles. Would you be kind enough
to carry us there?

343
00:28:58,717 --> 00:29:01,379
Any fool can see l ain't going that way.

344
00:29:01,453 --> 00:29:07,358
And if l was, l wouldn't haul my own kin
seven mile for nothing.

345
00:29:09,227 --> 00:29:15,188
Perhaps... you'd be interested
in selling this here mule and rig.

346
00:29:16,701 --> 00:29:18,726
You got money?

347
00:29:18,804 --> 00:29:21,637
Not on my person, naturally.

348
00:29:21,706 --> 00:29:26,837
Not enough to buy
a fine animal like this.

349
00:29:32,084 --> 00:29:34,416
l'd have to leave
some sort of collateral

350
00:29:34,486 --> 00:29:36,579
till the bank leaves my draft.

351
00:29:39,357 --> 00:29:42,520
You mean a swap?

352
00:29:56,808 --> 00:29:57,775
Whoa!

353
00:30:01,313 --> 00:30:03,975
What are we stopping here for?

354
00:30:04,049 --> 00:30:07,576
Just leave everything to me. Come on.

355
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,423
Ma'am.

356
00:30:17,529 --> 00:30:20,589
Sheriff, l have two runaway boys
to leave with you.

357
00:30:20,665 --> 00:30:21,689
What?!

358
00:30:21,766 --> 00:30:26,533
Davie, you didn't expect me to believe
that wild story about maps and whatnot?

359
00:30:26,638 --> 00:30:27,605
Miss Lauriette!

360
00:30:27,706 --> 00:30:31,403
lt's for your own good. You'll thank me
when you're back with your parents.

361
00:30:31,476 --> 00:30:34,775
- Where are you boys from?
- Up north of here.

362
00:30:34,846 --> 00:30:37,371
But we didn't really run away,
not because...

363
00:30:37,449 --> 00:30:41,385
You just put out a fugitive notice
on them. Somebody'll know who they are.

364
00:30:41,453 --> 00:30:44,718
You can't do that! Spangler'll see it!

365
00:30:44,789 --> 00:30:47,622
Davie, if l hear about Spangler
one more time...

366
00:30:47,692 --> 00:30:51,719
Now, now. You boys
better come on back here with me.

367
00:30:51,796 --> 00:30:54,526
- You can't put us in jail!
- lt ain't jail.

368
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:57,864
lt's what we call protective custody.
Come on, boys.

369
00:30:57,936 --> 00:31:01,895
Just till your folks come to claim you.
You're gonna be all right in here.

370
00:31:05,977 --> 00:31:09,913
Now, ma'am, if you can just write down
a few things you know about the boys,

371
00:31:09,981 --> 00:31:13,678
you know, where you found 'em,
their ages, things like that.

372
00:31:16,488 --> 00:31:19,787
- (Thad screams)
- (Davie) Help! Help!

373
00:31:19,858 --> 00:31:24,227
- Oh, my arm!
- lt's Thad! He's been bit by a spider!

374
00:31:24,296 --> 00:31:26,423
lt was a tarantula! l seen it!

375
00:31:26,498 --> 00:31:30,992
lt was big! Crawled in under there!
Must have had eight legs!

376
00:31:31,069 --> 00:31:36,006
- l just bet.
- Oh! Oh! My arm!

377
00:31:38,376 --> 00:31:41,209
Let me see. Come on.
Come on, let me see it.

378
00:31:51,423 --> 00:31:55,553
Davie Bernie, you come back here!
Resisting arrest is a felony!

379
00:31:55,627 --> 00:32:00,064
l don't know what that means, but
we been in worse trouble for three days!

380
00:32:09,341 --> 00:32:11,707
l'd like to get my hands on those two.

381
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:15,712
Thanks, Lamar. They just boys
who need a little guidance, that's all.

382
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:17,748
They don't lack for imagination.

383
00:32:17,849 --> 00:32:21,580
All that nonsense about secret maps
and people getting killed.

384
00:32:21,653 --> 00:32:26,613
They told me the biggest pack of lies
since the carpetbaggers came down here.

385
00:32:29,628 --> 00:32:34,895
Hey, sheriff. Any idea
where those two rascals might be headed?

386
00:32:34,966 --> 00:32:38,697
They'll probably keep to the river.
Most fugitives do.

387
00:33:06,865 --> 00:33:10,028
<i> Oh, he felt a chill
and he took to his bed</i>

388
00:33:10,101 --> 00:33:14,037
<i> He made his will
Had the good book read</i>

389
00:33:14,105 --> 00:33:19,065
<i> He was fading till Dr. Snodgrass'pill</i>

390
00:33:19,144 --> 00:33:21,305
<i> Had him up and about in the morning</i>

391
00:33:22,847 --> 00:33:25,509
<i> This is the burden of my tale</i>

392
00:33:25,583 --> 00:33:29,485
<i> Snodgrass's pill can never fail </i>

393
00:33:30,422 --> 00:33:33,084
(English accent)
Fine day for a constitutional.

394
00:33:33,158 --> 00:33:37,527
lncreases the circulation.
Reduces general debility.

395
00:33:37,595 --> 00:33:39,563
Sir?

396
00:33:39,664 --> 00:33:42,224
- You boys alone?
- Just me and Thad.

397
00:33:42,334 --> 00:33:44,097
Hmm.

398
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:50,236
- What you making?
- Elixir of swamp root.

399
00:33:51,643 --> 00:33:53,770
Funnel. There we are.

400
00:33:53,845 --> 00:33:59,806
Yes, as from the ancient formula
of the Aztec Aboriginal.

401
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,419
What's it for?

402
00:34:03,488 --> 00:34:07,515
Consumption, king's evil, gout, goiter,

403
00:34:07,592 --> 00:34:11,153
scurvy, carbuncles, dyspepsia,

404
00:34:11,262 --> 00:34:14,629
general skin disorder.

405
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:17,793
- lt can cure all that?
- That and more.

406
00:34:17,869 --> 00:34:21,032
And of all the people in the world,
you are the only two

407
00:34:21,106 --> 00:34:26,976
to have seen the nostrum
in its formulation.

408
00:34:27,045 --> 00:34:30,481
Are you going downriver?

409
00:34:33,651 --> 00:34:36,620
Could you use some help
as far as Friars Point?

410
00:34:38,289 --> 00:34:40,382
Are you boys wanted?

411
00:34:43,027 --> 00:34:44,995
lt's kind of a long story,

412
00:34:45,096 --> 00:34:48,657
and you probably wouldn't believe me
when l'm through.

413
00:34:48,733 --> 00:34:51,031
Well, some people don't.

414
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:55,729
Well, of course, l couldn't offer you
more than the usual apprentice wage.

415
00:34:55,840 --> 00:35:00,607
One dollar a week
with sustenance and lodging.

416
00:35:00,712 --> 00:35:03,772
But then, of course,
you'd have the privilege of serving

417
00:35:03,848 --> 00:35:07,545
the greatest master of the healing arts.

418
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:10,179
Who's that?

419
00:35:10,288 --> 00:35:12,381
Me. Dr...

420
00:35:12,457 --> 00:35:15,153
May l present myself?

421
00:35:15,226 --> 00:35:19,663
Ewing T. Snodgrass M.C...

422
00:35:19,731 --> 00:35:23,895
P.M.Ph...U.

423
00:35:29,107 --> 00:35:30,768
There we go.

424
00:35:32,177 --> 00:35:34,805
Come along now, medical students.

425
00:35:34,879 --> 00:35:38,178
Earn your dollar. Bring my bags.

426
00:35:38,249 --> 00:35:41,116
<i> Do you see that man
with a back so strong?</i>

427
00:35:41,186 --> 00:35:44,519
<i> Do you hear that man
with his party song </i>

428
00:35:44,589 --> 00:35:47,080
(chanting)

429
00:36:04,442 --> 00:36:08,208
Good people of Barskidell.

430
00:36:08,313 --> 00:36:11,874
You are all far sicker than you think.

431
00:36:12,884 --> 00:36:16,411
My opening incantation was, as always,

432
00:36:16,488 --> 00:36:18,615
in the Choctaw tongue

433
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:24,356
and dedicated to
the late, great chief, Wah-Wah-Too-Se.

434
00:36:24,429 --> 00:36:27,592
l am indebted to this great chief

435
00:36:27,699 --> 00:36:31,032
and to the whole Choctaw nation

436
00:36:31,102 --> 00:36:35,732
for my rugged constitution,
nay, for my life.

437
00:36:35,807 --> 00:36:38,970
- What did they do for you?
- What did they do for me?

438
00:36:39,043 --> 00:36:42,103
Trusses.

439
00:36:44,249 --> 00:36:47,878
Now, l have at hand
a limited supply of them

440
00:36:47,952 --> 00:36:51,718
and l am willing to let you have them
for one dollar apiece.

441
00:36:51,789 --> 00:36:55,919
And l'm going to send
my two young Choctaw assistants,

442
00:36:55,994 --> 00:36:59,657
Swift Deer and Brave Bear,

443
00:36:59,731 --> 00:37:03,599
among you
in order to help you adjust them

444
00:37:03,668 --> 00:37:06,831
according to your own
particular requirements.

445
00:37:06,905 --> 00:37:09,032
(speaks fake Choctaw)

446
00:37:09,807 --> 00:37:11,672
- Come on.
- l'll take one!

447
00:37:11,743 --> 00:37:15,110
- Over here! l'll take one.
- l want one.

448
00:37:15,213 --> 00:37:21,174
lf, my friends, if you are not
rejuvenated with new vigor

449
00:37:21,286 --> 00:37:24,847
within 24 hours
of receiving these trusses,

450
00:37:24,956 --> 00:37:28,517
you'll get double your money back
and five cents of the ten cents

451
00:37:28,626 --> 00:37:31,527
for the instruction books.

452
00:37:31,596 --> 00:37:36,898
There we are. lf any of you happen
to be interested in the long life,

453
00:37:36,968 --> 00:37:38,993
you'd do well to invest

454
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:43,302
in Dr. Snodgrass
fever, ague and liver pads.

455
00:37:43,374 --> 00:37:46,502
They are the only known cure
for malaria,

456
00:37:46,578 --> 00:37:49,445
dyspepsia, aching joints, frostbite...

457
00:37:49,514 --> 00:37:52,244
What tribe you from again?

458
00:37:52,317 --> 00:37:54,945
- Choctaw.
- Come again?

459
00:37:55,954 --> 00:37:58,684
You heard the man, Choctaw.

460
00:38:01,225 --> 00:38:05,093
You are receiving these
at cost.

461
00:38:05,163 --> 00:38:07,996
Swift Deer, Brave Bear.

462
00:38:08,066 --> 00:38:12,025
Perhaps you would run back and find us
some more of our miracle medicine.

463
00:38:18,843 --> 00:38:22,506
They need to know their own language.
They are incorrigible.

464
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:26,539
And yet, you know,
anyone who loves children loves them.

465
00:38:26,618 --> 00:38:30,110
Gotta hurry so Dr. Snodgrass
won't lose the crowd.

466
00:38:38,963 --> 00:38:41,295
Don't break it down. l'm coming.

467
00:38:46,571 --> 00:38:48,539
Yes, ma'am?

468
00:38:49,507 --> 00:38:51,805
Are you the law in this town?

469
00:38:51,876 --> 00:38:54,436
Does that look like
it come off a Christmas tree?

470
00:38:54,545 --> 00:38:58,003
Well, Sheriff, while you sleep away
the better part of the day,

471
00:38:58,082 --> 00:39:00,550
two runaway boys disguised as lndians

472
00:39:00,618 --> 00:39:02,882
have fallen into the hands
of a charlatan,

473
00:39:02,954 --> 00:39:06,117
an obvious fraud who is hogswaggling
the citizens of this town

474
00:39:06,224 --> 00:39:09,250
with worthless contraptions
and useless concoctions.

475
00:39:09,327 --> 00:39:12,091
- ls his name Snodgrass?
- That's the one.

476
00:39:12,163 --> 00:39:14,495
l've been waiting for this slick boot.

477
00:39:14,565 --> 00:39:17,728
You wait till l get my hands on him.
Where is he?

478
00:39:17,802 --> 00:39:21,101
That stream outside town.
You'll hear him before you see him.

479
00:39:21,172 --> 00:39:24,699
Where can l sell that mule and rig
and get myself a steamship ticket

480
00:39:24,776 --> 00:39:26,835
and some kind of a... decent dress?

481
00:39:26,911 --> 00:39:30,847
Frank Candy deals in mules. lf you
wanna get yourself a steamship ticket,

482
00:39:30,915 --> 00:39:34,078
go down the river
and start a fire like everybody else.

483
00:39:34,185 --> 00:39:38,349
Sometimes they stop, sometimes they
don't. There's a store round the corner.

484
00:39:38,456 --> 00:39:40,754
Wait till l get my hands
on that Snodgrass!

485
00:39:40,825 --> 00:39:44,591
He ain't gonna never hogswaggle anybody
anymore, l guarantee that.

486
00:39:44,662 --> 00:39:48,325
Anyone will see at least the box.

487
00:39:48,399 --> 00:39:50,663
Now, obviously the last thing
l wish to do

488
00:39:50,735 --> 00:39:53,499
is to fit glasses to those
who have no need for them.

489
00:39:53,571 --> 00:39:55,300
- No, no.
- Hey, you!

490
00:39:56,441 --> 00:40:00,468
Sheriff Forbes, well,
this is providence indeed.

491
00:40:00,545 --> 00:40:02,103
Don't you providence me!

492
00:40:02,213 --> 00:40:05,649
Last year you sold me a belt
guaranteed to restore male vigor.

493
00:40:05,717 --> 00:40:09,676
- All l got was a case of hives!
- Hives?

494
00:40:09,754 --> 00:40:11,585
Sheriff Forbes.

495
00:40:17,128 --> 00:40:19,562
Next time
you get to fall out of the tree.

496
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:22,326
That Spooju Juice tastes awful.

497
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,766
Remember what Dr. Snodgrass said.

498
00:40:24,869 --> 00:40:28,100
Don't scratch or do nothing,
even if you get an itch.

499
00:40:29,373 --> 00:40:31,671
All right. Get going.

500
00:40:33,644 --> 00:40:36,511
Now that my liver pads
have calmed your irascibility,

501
00:40:36,581 --> 00:40:38,674
we'll proceed with your eye test.

502
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:41,844
Would you do me the goodness
of reading the first line?

503
00:40:41,919 --> 00:40:43,887
''E, B, F, G, K.''

504
00:40:44,689 --> 00:40:47,351
Correct.

505
00:40:47,425 --> 00:40:50,258
- Second line, please.
- ''R, S, M, T, 1 .''

506
00:40:51,796 --> 00:40:53,491
That is l.

507
00:40:57,802 --> 00:41:00,464
Still, it's very good.
Third line now, please.

508
00:41:00,538 --> 00:41:03,063
''A, H, P, C, Y.''

509
00:41:03,141 --> 00:41:05,439
Excellent.

510
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:07,603
Fourth line.

511
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:15,819
- There ain't no fourth line.

512
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:20,289
How very strange. l thought there was
this morning, but you may be right.

513
00:41:24,028 --> 00:41:26,895
No fourth line?

514
00:41:33,304 --> 00:41:37,070
l'll try these rugged,
masculine glasses.

515
00:41:37,141 --> 00:41:39,701
Nothing at all intellectual about them.

516
00:41:41,379 --> 00:41:46,146
lf there's any adjustment, we can do it
later, if the eyelashes catch the lens.

517
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:48,810
Now, try that.

518
00:41:50,354 --> 00:41:53,517
l see it plain as day. M, H, R, T, A.

519
00:41:56,227 --> 00:41:59,287
M, H, R, T, A.

520
00:41:59,363 --> 00:42:02,127
Oh, that's wonderful!

521
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,225
Yet another example, my friends,

522
00:42:04,302 --> 00:42:09,740
of the burdens which so many of us
carry unnecessarily through life.

523
00:42:09,807 --> 00:42:15,143
l hope you realize now, Sheriff Forbes,
what you have been missing for so long.

524
00:42:15,213 --> 00:42:19,775
- No fourth line.

525
00:42:19,884 --> 00:42:22,045
Mister, you a doctor?

526
00:42:22,153 --> 00:42:25,316
D.C.M.P.PhU.

527
00:42:25,389 --> 00:42:27,516
But do not disturb me now, son.

528
00:42:27,592 --> 00:42:30,527
- There's a boy fell out of a tree.
- Well...

529
00:42:30,595 --> 00:42:32,756
l think his back's broke.

530
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:34,798
His back is broken?

531
00:42:34,899 --> 00:42:38,562
Medical ethics will not permit me
to tarry, ladies and gentlemen.

532
00:42:38,636 --> 00:42:41,696
No, l need no help.
This is an emergency. Thank you.

533
00:42:41,772 --> 00:42:44,240
- Lead me to that unfortunate lad.
- This way!

534
00:42:44,308 --> 00:42:46,606
- Lead me to the broken back!
- This way!

535
00:42:46,677 --> 00:42:49,009
Help is on the way! You can hear me!

536
00:42:49,981 --> 00:42:51,949
Come on.

537
00:42:58,356 --> 00:43:00,483
He's here. l seen him fall.

538
00:43:00,558 --> 00:43:03,652
l asked him if he was all right,
but he just lay there.

539
00:43:03,728 --> 00:43:06,663
Calm, calm down. Keep back, everyone.

540
00:43:06,731 --> 00:43:08,699
Stand back.

541
00:43:11,535 --> 00:43:14,060
- ls he alive?
- Barely.

542
00:43:14,138 --> 00:43:17,875
lt's a... lt's a vertebral severance,
l'm afraid.

543
00:43:17,875 --> 00:43:18,136
lt's a... lt's a vertebral severance,
l'm afraid.

544
00:43:18,209 --> 00:43:22,737
Yes, it's a hiatus of the vital fluid.
HVF, as we like to call it.

545
00:43:22,813 --> 00:43:25,839
l hope we're not too late.
l wish you'd called me earlier.

546
00:43:25,917 --> 00:43:29,375
But by then he'd not yet fallen
out of the tree, l understand that.

547
00:43:29,453 --> 00:43:31,546
Yes, just a moment.

548
00:43:31,622 --> 00:43:36,355
l would like some of the ruby
nutrient anodyne, please.

549
00:43:36,427 --> 00:43:39,396
- What?
- The Spooju Juice which l sold you.

550
00:43:39,463 --> 00:43:44,093
lt is only one dollar a bottle.
Now we're going to try this on the boy.

551
00:43:44,168 --> 00:43:47,695
Now, come on. That's the way, lad.

552
00:43:47,772 --> 00:43:51,606
Just a sip should do it.
This nostrum is extremely po...

553
00:43:51,676 --> 00:43:56,340
Come on, sip. Extremely potent for such
a modest price, ladies and gentlemen.

554
00:43:56,414 --> 00:44:00,316
We should see the youngster
up and about in no time. That's it.

555
00:44:00,384 --> 00:44:03,945
Now, the elixir should work
in about ten seconds.

556
00:44:04,055 --> 00:44:09,015
That is, of course, that is if there's
any life left in the lad at all.

557
00:44:13,864 --> 00:44:18,824
Ah. You will notice how the color
has returned to the youngster's cheeks.

558
00:44:18,936 --> 00:44:22,497
Are you feeling better, son? Ye... Oh.

559
00:44:22,606 --> 00:44:25,074
What's the matter?

560
00:44:25,142 --> 00:44:26,109
Davie.

561
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:29,475
This seems rather graver
than l had at first thought.

562
00:44:29,547 --> 00:44:31,276
Now, come along, lad.

563
00:44:31,349 --> 00:44:34,978
You can feel my ruby elixir
coursing through your veins, can't you?

564
00:44:35,052 --> 00:44:37,919
lt is taking effect, lad.

565
00:44:37,989 --> 00:44:41,755
For heaven's sake, boy,
if you can hear me, speak to me.

566
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:47,290
Speak to me. What is your name?

567
00:44:51,202 --> 00:44:54,296
Davie Bernie,
and he's a runaway from Kentucky.

568
00:44:54,372 --> 00:44:56,533
lt's Spangler, Thad! Get outta here!

569
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,608
Outta the way!

570
00:45:01,345 --> 00:45:03,313
Now you've done it good!

571
00:46:59,163 --> 00:47:01,495
You have something l want.

572
00:47:06,504 --> 00:47:08,836
Hand it over, boy.

573
00:47:10,574 --> 00:47:13,065
Put up your hands,
y'all hear?

574
00:47:14,311 --> 00:47:17,144
You ought to be ashamed.

575
00:47:17,214 --> 00:47:19,705
Grown men picking on that boy?

576
00:47:21,152 --> 00:47:23,916
Now, ma'am,
we don't mean the boy any harm.

577
00:47:23,988 --> 00:47:28,948
He took something that belongs to me.
l want it back. Simple as that.

578
00:47:33,364 --> 00:47:35,696
Come on over here, Davie.

579
00:47:39,103 --> 00:47:42,436
l don't say things
that l don't mean, sir.

580
00:47:42,506 --> 00:47:44,974
Now, you all put up your hands
and turn around.

581
00:47:46,744 --> 00:47:48,712
Come on, all of you.

582
00:47:50,414 --> 00:47:55,977
Now, walk back to the edge
where you had the boy.

583
00:47:57,888 --> 00:47:59,856
l said walk!

584
00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:08,160
Come on.

585
00:48:08,232 --> 00:48:10,200
Walk.

586
00:48:23,447 --> 00:48:25,415
Now...

587
00:48:27,918 --> 00:48:30,284
...you jump, Yankee.

588
00:48:30,354 --> 00:48:32,515
You defile this land.

589
00:48:57,114 --> 00:48:59,082
Look out below!

590
00:49:10,628 --> 00:49:14,758
Come on, Davie.
Nothing of interest to you down there.

591
00:49:30,314 --> 00:49:32,282
Thank you, son.

592
00:49:33,217 --> 00:49:36,050
A generous application
of my Aesculapius ointment

593
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:38,884
would have those abrasions
gone by the morning.

594
00:49:38,956 --> 00:49:41,720
Along with his arm.

595
00:49:41,825 --> 00:49:44,293
Well, l believe you now about Spangler.

596
00:49:44,361 --> 00:49:48,127
Ooh. l never saw
such a parcel of cutthroats.

597
00:49:48,232 --> 00:49:50,928
They'd have killed us all
for a five-dollar piece.

598
00:49:51,001 --> 00:49:52,969
What were they after?

599
00:49:55,606 --> 00:50:00,168
Davie, l think that you ought to find
that uncle of yours.

600
00:50:00,277 --> 00:50:02,837
You tell him your problem.
Maybe he can help you.

601
00:50:02,946 --> 00:50:05,107
Uncle Jim can do just about anything.

602
00:50:05,182 --> 00:50:07,514
He once started a salt factory
by the ocean,

603
00:50:07,584 --> 00:50:10,246
but the dam busted
and all the salt washed away.

604
00:50:10,321 --> 00:50:13,688
And he had his own railroad once,
but it was built over a bog

605
00:50:13,757 --> 00:50:16,282
and a whole train disappeared.

606
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:19,852
Sounds like your uncle
has the Midas touch.

607
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:23,764
Well, l don't know about that, but
l guess my uncle's just about famous.

608
00:50:26,470 --> 00:50:29,962
l can only tell you that l have
in my possession affidavits

609
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:33,009
from some of the most
influential people in the land,

610
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:37,809
testifying to the fact
that one single bottle of Spooju Juice

611
00:50:37,881 --> 00:50:41,783
rescued them after years
of the most intolerable pain.

612
00:50:41,852 --> 00:50:43,820
You'll find Jim Bernie out yonder,

613
00:50:43,921 --> 00:50:47,789
but if y'all wanna talk to him,
you'll have to hurry.

614
00:50:47,858 --> 00:50:49,917
Sir?

615
00:50:49,993 --> 00:50:52,291
ls Mr. Bernie going someplace?

616
00:50:52,363 --> 00:50:56,231
- One way or t'other, he is.

617
00:50:58,936 --> 00:51:01,803
Maybe it's a revival meeting,
or a going-away party.

618
00:51:03,107 --> 00:51:06,975
- Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.
- Light her up, damn it!

619
00:51:12,349 --> 00:51:13,714
lt's a lynching.

620
00:51:18,021 --> 00:51:21,047
- ls that Uncle Jim?
- l suspect so.

621
00:51:22,426 --> 00:51:24,860
- Help!
- Uncle Jim!

622
00:51:24,928 --> 00:51:26,657
Davie, wait!

623
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:29,563
No, no! lt's no place for you, Thad.

624
00:51:29,633 --> 00:51:30,930
Uncle Jim!

625
00:51:33,537 --> 00:51:35,903
Uncle Jim, is that you?

626
00:51:36,006 --> 00:51:38,497
- Who are you?
- Davie Bernie from Grassy.

627
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:41,978
- Davie?
- Yes, sir.

628
00:51:42,045 --> 00:51:42,546
Well, l'm sorry to make your
acquaintance under these circumstances.

629
00:51:42,546 --> 00:51:46,209
Well, l'm sorry to make your
acquaintance under these circumstances.

630
00:51:48,585 --> 00:51:52,316
- What brings you to Friars Point?
- We were headed down to New Orleans.

631
00:51:52,389 --> 00:51:54,357
We stopped by to get you.

632
00:51:54,458 --> 00:51:56,619
l'm afraid l'm tied up.

633
00:51:59,930 --> 00:52:03,024
- Who's we?
- Me, Miss Paxton and some others.

634
00:52:04,168 --> 00:52:06,398
Ma'am.

635
00:52:07,538 --> 00:52:09,506
l'd tip my hat, but...

636
00:52:09,606 --> 00:52:13,133
Let's cut this jabber
and get this here tree decorated.

637
00:52:13,210 --> 00:52:15,940
(shouting)

638
00:52:16,013 --> 00:52:20,575
Bernie, l hope your carcass'll be
a warning to the next man.

639
00:52:20,651 --> 00:52:23,882
- No!
- Get outta here! Go on!

640
00:52:25,389 --> 00:52:29,883
Tear these up into strips, this lining.

641
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:32,224
...souls of extermination!

642
00:52:32,296 --> 00:52:34,457
Slay all the traitors!

643
00:52:34,531 --> 00:52:37,295
Again shall vengeance reek

644
00:52:37,401 --> 00:52:40,837
Till blood shall flow
through every creek!

645
00:52:40,904 --> 00:52:44,340
- Moons of...
- lf l'm on my way to kingdom come,

646
00:52:44,408 --> 00:52:47,639
l don't want the last words l hear
to be your Klan claptrap.

647
00:52:47,711 --> 00:52:51,613
Grant me a last wish. Shut your mouth.

648
00:52:51,682 --> 00:52:53,912
Glad to oblige.

649
00:52:53,984 --> 00:52:56,145
Let this be a lesson
to the next do-gooder

650
00:52:56,253 --> 00:52:59,120
tries to poke his nose in our business.

651
00:53:09,199 --> 00:53:11,463
Grab hold of that kid
and give him what for!

652
00:53:11,535 --> 00:53:13,093
Over my dead body!

653
00:53:13,203 --> 00:53:18,573
lf that's what you want,
ain't nobody here gonna fuss, lady.

654
00:53:20,978 --> 00:53:23,344
With the wrath of God,

655
00:53:24,381 --> 00:53:26,645
vengeance is mine!

656
00:53:30,988 --> 00:53:35,550
You're gonna reap what y'all sow,
you hear?

657
00:53:52,743 --> 00:53:54,643
Mind the horses.

658
00:53:56,547 --> 00:53:59,311
The Philistines are in flight!

659
00:53:59,383 --> 00:54:03,012
Come along. Shut the bag, will you?

660
00:54:10,661 --> 00:54:15,496
For once, your Spooju Juice
really did help someone.

661
00:54:24,641 --> 00:54:27,371
- Hey, what's your name?
- Thaddeus.

662
00:54:27,444 --> 00:54:29,571
Thaddeus. Yeah?

663
00:54:31,682 --> 00:54:34,617
Some mighty fine shooting, lad.

664
00:54:34,685 --> 00:54:37,017
That was a brave thing you did.

665
00:54:50,167 --> 00:54:54,001
And there were some other islands
right about here, called keys.

666
00:54:55,138 --> 00:54:58,005
And the cypress trees
were right... here.

667
00:54:59,543 --> 00:55:03,570
And the X where we think the treasure is
was right next to this tree here.

668
00:55:03,647 --> 00:55:06,411
Uh-uh. By this one.

669
00:55:08,452 --> 00:55:11,615
lt's kind of hard to keep things
straight in your head.

670
00:55:13,023 --> 00:55:16,390
There must be something there
or Spangler wouldn't be after it.

671
00:55:16,493 --> 00:55:18,586
Well, Ben said it was real valuable.

672
00:55:18,662 --> 00:55:21,790
You can find it, can't you, Uncle Jim?

673
00:55:21,865 --> 00:55:23,833
lt's a needle in a haystack.

674
00:55:25,502 --> 00:55:28,869
But l have no better prospects
at the moment.

675
00:55:28,939 --> 00:55:32,238
Doctor, how about throwing in with us,
with Davie's approval?

676
00:55:32,309 --> 00:55:33,276
Sure.

677
00:55:33,377 --> 00:55:37,211
Oh, ten years ago
l would have seized the chance,

678
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,407
but, no, l...

679
00:55:39,483 --> 00:55:43,647
l simply cannot ignore
the call of those...

680
00:55:43,754 --> 00:55:47,315
...poor unfortunates along the river.

681
00:55:48,258 --> 00:55:50,590
And you think our chances
are pretty slim.

682
00:55:54,464 --> 00:55:57,228
The boys and l'll stick with you
as far as New Orleans.

683
00:55:57,334 --> 00:55:59,461
- lf that's all right.
- My pleasure.

684
00:55:59,536 --> 00:56:02,096
Then we'll head for Tampa
and outfit ourselves

685
00:56:02,172 --> 00:56:05,232
for the final leg to Whitewater Cove.

686
00:56:05,308 --> 00:56:08,766
Frankly, Mr. Bernie,
l think that you're courting disaster.

687
00:56:08,845 --> 00:56:12,906
Even if you find that treasure,
Spangler will take it away from you

688
00:56:12,983 --> 00:56:15,918
and he'll kill you all into the bargain.

689
00:56:15,986 --> 00:56:18,682
There's no law
down in those swamps, you know.

690
00:56:18,755 --> 00:56:24,125
People just disappear
and never are heard from again.

691
00:57:12,943 --> 00:57:16,709
To hear Davie talk,
you could part these waters

692
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:19,248
and we could go
the rest of the way by carriage.

693
00:57:25,021 --> 00:57:27,546
Not that for a moment
l'd even consider it,

694
00:57:27,624 --> 00:57:31,856
it's just l'm curious
why you didn't ask me to go along to...

695
00:57:31,928 --> 00:57:34,658
this... Matecumbe?

696
00:57:34,731 --> 00:57:38,030
l just thought you'd be out of place.

697
00:57:38,101 --> 00:57:40,763
You have strong feelings
about a woman's place?

698
00:57:41,872 --> 00:57:45,433
No offence, ma'am,
but in my opinion it's at home.

699
00:57:45,509 --> 00:57:50,173
ln my experience, ladies of your
station are unsurpassed at parlor talk.

700
00:57:50,247 --> 00:57:55,014
l've rarely seen anything as attractive
as a bevy of you at a ball.

701
00:57:55,118 --> 00:57:59,077
And l'm sure you could snap a fan
with the best of 'em.

702
00:58:00,190 --> 00:58:04,627
All that would just go to waste
in the swamps, wouldn't you say?

703
00:58:05,495 --> 00:58:08,828
l'll say good day, Mr... Bernie?

704
00:58:09,633 --> 00:58:11,123
Just call me Jim.

705
00:58:28,485 --> 00:58:32,148
What are you gonna do
with your share of the money, Thad?

706
00:58:32,222 --> 00:58:35,589
Well, l always wanted a mule of my own.

707
00:58:36,593 --> 00:58:38,561
Like that one back in Coahoma.

708
00:58:39,896 --> 00:58:45,027
Or maybe one of those three-bladed
knives in Mr. Butler's window.

709
00:58:46,169 --> 00:58:49,036
You could also buy a new life
with that money, Thad.

710
00:58:49,105 --> 00:58:52,074
- How do you buy a new life?
- Through knowledge.

711
00:58:52,175 --> 00:58:55,838
Learning. lt's learning, you see,
that'll really set you free.

712
00:58:56,813 --> 00:59:01,944
Learn all you can about everything
and it'll open up new horizons for you.

713
00:59:15,398 --> 00:59:17,866
There's a landing round the bend.

714
00:59:17,934 --> 00:59:20,300
They're few and far between
on this stretch.

715
00:59:20,403 --> 00:59:22,633
l always stop here for provisions.

716
00:59:22,706 --> 00:59:25,174
Fine, Doc.

717
00:59:29,846 --> 00:59:35,011
Mr. Bernie, l've thrown together
some mullet puree.

718
00:59:35,085 --> 00:59:39,146
l wonder if l could take a moment
of your time for your expert opinion.

719
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:47,387
Davie, give Miss Paxton's fixings a try.

720
00:59:47,464 --> 00:59:52,333
lf it passes muster with Davie,
you'll know it's a success.

721
01:00:01,778 --> 01:00:04,508
l'll take the tiller, Bernie.
Thank you.

722
01:00:21,564 --> 01:00:24,055
Mind if we tie on? Won't be a minute.

723
01:00:54,164 --> 01:00:56,132
You boys wanna stretch your legs?

724
01:00:59,803 --> 01:01:01,771
No, thanks.

725
01:01:08,144 --> 01:01:10,510
Much obliged.

726
01:01:10,613 --> 01:01:12,581
Gentlemen.

727
01:01:13,717 --> 01:01:15,275
Well, good...

728
01:01:31,935 --> 01:01:36,838
''Music hath charms
to soothe a savage breast.''

729
01:01:37,807 --> 01:01:40,469
- Who said that?
- William Congreve.

730
01:01:40,543 --> 01:01:44,274
1 670 to 1 729.

731
01:01:47,150 --> 01:01:49,983
Come on, Thad.
Remember what we practiced?

732
01:01:51,187 --> 01:01:53,678
Come on, Davie.

733
01:02:08,471 --> 01:02:10,439
Get along there.

734
01:02:34,631 --> 01:02:36,599
Nice.

735
01:02:47,911 --> 01:02:50,072
Hey, Curly!

736
01:02:50,180 --> 01:02:54,549
Get that screech box of yours going.
Let's show 'em how it's really done!

737
01:03:46,169 --> 01:03:50,731
Hey, looky there, looky there!
A real live female!

738
01:04:34,784 --> 01:04:38,276
Why, you didn't tell me
you were having a party.

739
01:04:38,354 --> 01:04:41,915
These are flatboat men, and
no one to fool with. You get inside.

740
01:04:44,027 --> 01:04:45,995
- Hold it! Hold it!

741
01:04:48,198 --> 01:04:53,465
- May l have the pleasure, ma'am?
- Why, how exciting.

742
01:04:53,536 --> 01:04:56,027
lt's been years
since l've been to a ball.

743
01:04:57,574 --> 01:05:00,008
Whoo!

744
01:05:00,076 --> 01:05:03,307
- l forgot my fan.
- No.

745
01:05:57,500 --> 01:05:59,468
Thad, Davie.

746
01:06:01,237 --> 01:06:03,000
When l give word,
release the lines.

747
01:06:03,072 --> 01:06:04,630
Right.

748
01:06:09,312 --> 01:06:11,280
Thad, take the bow.

749
01:06:30,633 --> 01:06:33,158
Oh, you want to waltz, do you?

750
01:06:49,018 --> 01:06:51,578
Now, boys!

751
01:07:01,664 --> 01:07:03,131
Jump!

752
01:07:09,639 --> 01:07:12,005
Jump!

753
01:07:24,554 --> 01:07:26,522
Miss Lauriette...

754
01:07:32,061 --> 01:07:34,029
Puree's burning.

755
01:07:52,115 --> 01:07:54,083
Davie.

756
01:07:55,985 --> 01:07:58,715
- Hey, Davie.
- Yeah.

757
01:07:58,788 --> 01:08:02,155
- Wanna try for some catfish?
- No.

758
01:08:05,461 --> 01:08:07,827
Are you in love with Miss Paxton, Davie?

759
01:08:07,897 --> 01:08:10,832
Heck, no. That's the dumbest thing
l ever heard.

760
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:13,232
l think she might be in love with you.

761
01:08:14,137 --> 01:08:16,105
What makes you think that?

762
01:08:16,205 --> 01:08:18,833
Remember the way she hugged you
at Friars Point?

763
01:08:18,908 --> 01:08:20,739
She hugged you a long time.

764
01:08:20,810 --> 01:08:24,337
l didn't wanna hurt her feelings.
That's why l let her hang on to me.

765
01:08:24,414 --> 01:08:27,781
l know a way how you could find out
if she really loves you.

766
01:08:33,990 --> 01:08:34,957
How?

767
01:08:35,057 --> 01:08:37,821
lf you put a girl's hand in water
when she's sleeping,

768
01:08:37,894 --> 01:08:40,055
she'll tell you
the name of her sweetheart.

769
01:08:40,163 --> 01:08:43,860
That has gotta be the dumbest thing
l ever heard.

770
01:08:43,933 --> 01:08:47,096
She's napping now.
We could find out easy.

771
01:09:05,721 --> 01:09:07,882
Let's get a pan.

772
01:09:13,629 --> 01:09:15,597
By the shore, Captain.

773
01:09:23,473 --> 01:09:26,135
- lt's them.
- You see the kid?

774
01:09:26,209 --> 01:09:28,769
Nobody's on deck.

775
01:09:28,878 --> 01:09:32,006
lt's that quack medicine man's boat.

776
01:09:32,081 --> 01:09:34,413
- Hold your speed!
- Yes, sir!

777
01:09:35,618 --> 01:09:37,820
They won't get away this time.

778
01:09:39,021 --> 01:09:40,989
Hold your speed.

779
01:09:54,337 --> 01:09:59,468
Listen close.
She's gonna say it real softly.

780
01:09:59,542 --> 01:10:03,308
Sinking! We're sinking!
We're sinking! We're sinking!

781
01:10:03,412 --> 01:10:05,880
What do you think you're doing?
l'm soaking!

782
01:10:05,948 --> 01:10:08,712
Thad! Davie! Oh, what...! Oh, you...!

783
01:10:09,819 --> 01:10:15,587
Thad. Davie!
l'll suffer the both of you kids.

784
01:10:15,691 --> 01:10:20,390
You are the most powerful aggravating
kids l ever saw. Come here. Come here.

785
01:10:21,230 --> 01:10:22,959
Something's stirred 'em up.

786
01:10:23,032 --> 01:10:26,399
Tell me what you think you were doing
in there with that water.

787
01:10:26,502 --> 01:10:29,062
- What's going on?
- Nothing!

788
01:10:29,171 --> 01:10:32,140
Nothing? Look at me!

789
01:10:32,241 --> 01:10:35,335
They tried to drown me in my sleep.

790
01:10:35,411 --> 01:10:38,380
We didn't. We just spilled
a little water, that's all.

791
01:10:38,447 --> 01:10:42,611
What's that steamboat coming straight
towards us? Davie, get me my spyglass.

792
01:10:42,685 --> 01:10:44,846
ln there. Thank you.

793
01:10:47,390 --> 01:10:50,359
lt wouldn't be Spangler,
by any chance, would it?

794
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:54,320
- lt's him!
- They'll be on us in a minute. Come on.

795
01:10:56,465 --> 01:10:59,229
Open fire!

796
01:11:33,102 --> 01:11:35,263
Spread out. Search everywhere.

797
01:12:08,337 --> 01:12:10,305
Can you run a steamboat?

798
01:12:15,177 --> 01:12:17,509
Can l run a steamboat?

799
01:12:24,387 --> 01:12:26,355
What's he doing?

800
01:12:37,967 --> 01:12:39,798
This way, boys! Run!

801
01:12:39,869 --> 01:12:41,837
Over here!

802
01:12:47,877 --> 01:12:50,846
To the boat. Come on. Come on!

803
01:13:01,457 --> 01:13:05,086
Don't keep looking back, lad.
They'll be on us soon enough.

804
01:13:05,161 --> 01:13:08,722
Come on, come on. Come on.

805
01:13:08,798 --> 01:13:11,164
Go on, help the lady. Hurry now, boys.

806
01:13:11,233 --> 01:13:14,691
We're taking the other boat.
lt's faster. Come on.

807
01:13:14,770 --> 01:13:18,797
l'll be with you in a minute. No, no,
Thad. Leave it to me. Go on, quickly.

808
01:13:26,916 --> 01:13:31,080
- (Davie) Come on, Dr. Snodgrass!
- (Lauriette) What are you doing?

809
01:13:32,722 --> 01:13:36,021
- Sorry.
- Hurry, Doctor. Hurry.

810
01:13:36,092 --> 01:13:38,583
All right, shove off. Come on.

811
01:13:39,395 --> 01:13:43,354
Off we go. l'll help you with that.

812
01:13:43,466 --> 01:13:45,525
You sure you know how to run this thing?

813
01:13:45,601 --> 01:13:49,537
l haven't the vaguest idea. Never tried.
You're on your own. Take it away.

814
01:13:49,605 --> 01:13:51,971
- What about Jim?
- We have no choice.

815
01:13:52,041 --> 01:13:55,067
No! You can't just leave him there!

816
01:13:55,144 --> 01:13:58,170
lt was his decision.
Now let's get this vessel underway.

817
01:13:58,247 --> 01:14:01,216
What about this one, Doctor?
Maybe it's this one.

818
01:14:01,317 --> 01:14:03,080
No, no, no, no.

819
01:14:06,989 --> 01:14:09,822
lf this thing goes backward,
it'll also go for...

820
01:14:09,892 --> 01:14:12,861
Don't crowd me! l'll apologize later on.

821
01:14:12,928 --> 01:14:16,591
l can't be bothered.
l've got to get this thing...

822
01:14:16,665 --> 01:14:19,566
Oh, confounded steam.

823
01:14:19,635 --> 01:14:23,264
Ah. lt isn't that. Could it be this?

824
01:14:26,575 --> 01:14:29,043
- (steamboat's whistle)
- Hold it.

825
01:14:34,316 --> 01:14:36,546
Come on.

826
01:14:36,619 --> 01:14:41,079
- lt's perfectly all right.
- Surely they heard that.

827
01:14:41,157 --> 01:14:44,615
Ah. Ah! We're going forward!

828
01:14:55,171 --> 01:14:59,005
Look out. Take cover.
Spangler and his merry men.

829
01:15:14,723 --> 01:15:16,486
To the keelboat!

830
01:15:37,112 --> 01:15:39,342
Uncle Jim.

831
01:16:22,224 --> 01:16:24,590
Come on, baby. Yeah!

832
01:16:39,174 --> 01:16:42,610
There's no trace of him anywhere.

833
01:16:44,580 --> 01:16:50,018
lt's difficult, l know,
but l think we must conclude that...

834
01:16:50,085 --> 01:16:52,383
...Jim Bernie is dead.

835
01:16:56,091 --> 01:17:00,050
Needless to say, we all owe him
a great debt of gratitude.

836
01:17:00,129 --> 01:17:03,064
Oh, l'm arranging
for a passage for the boys

837
01:17:03,132 --> 01:17:06,761
on the first passenger ship
going north.

838
01:17:06,835 --> 01:17:10,202
Once home, put yourselves
in the hands of the local authorities

839
01:17:10,306 --> 01:17:13,036
until such a time as...

840
01:17:13,108 --> 01:17:17,408
...as Spangler and his villainous
cohorts are brought to justice.

841
01:17:19,214 --> 01:17:20,909
He's right.

842
01:17:22,418 --> 01:17:25,854
Davie, l believe you have something.

843
01:17:27,389 --> 01:17:31,485
lt belongs to you
and l wish to see you have it.

844
01:17:32,761 --> 01:17:35,855
But you really must go home.

845
01:17:35,931 --> 01:17:38,627
Two lives have been sacrificed already,

846
01:17:38,701 --> 01:17:42,933
and the menace of Spangler
is ever present.

847
01:17:44,673 --> 01:17:46,641
Let it go, boy.

848
01:17:49,311 --> 01:17:52,007
l'm not going back.

849
01:17:52,081 --> 01:17:54,242
- You still wanna go, Thad?
- lf you do.

850
01:17:55,150 --> 01:17:57,118
We'll be all right.

851
01:17:58,487 --> 01:18:02,787
Thank you, Dr. Snodgrass.
Sorry about your boat.

852
01:18:02,858 --> 01:18:06,089
Bye, Miss Lauriette.
Thank you for everything.

853
01:18:06,161 --> 01:18:08,652
- We really appreciate it.
- Sit down.

854
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:14,958
l'm not about to let you goslings
go traipsing off by yourselves.

855
01:18:15,037 --> 01:18:19,269
lf you're dead set
on getting that... treasure...

856
01:18:24,980 --> 01:18:27,505
...l'm going with you.

857
01:18:36,959 --> 01:18:40,918
Well... never let it be said

858
01:18:40,996 --> 01:18:43,260
that Dr. Ewing T. Snodgrass

859
01:18:43,332 --> 01:18:47,792
deserted his friends
in their hour of need.

860
01:18:48,871 --> 01:18:51,635
We'll find it, Dr. Snodgrass.

861
01:18:51,740 --> 01:18:56,404
Well, if we don't, it won't be
for lack of trying. Now, let me see.

862
01:18:57,479 --> 01:19:02,416
Spangler will be watching the docks,
which means that we should proceed...

863
01:19:02,484 --> 01:19:05,647
inland, with guile.

864
01:19:07,623 --> 01:19:09,591
And dispatch.

865
01:19:14,329 --> 01:19:16,820
Maybe l should have married that Yankee.

866
01:19:29,878 --> 01:19:31,436
Bo.

867
01:19:31,513 --> 01:19:33,481
Over here.

868
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:40,420
Well?

869
01:19:40,489 --> 01:19:44,755
l think l seen 'em at the station house.
They left on a train.

870
01:19:44,827 --> 01:19:47,557
- What'd they look like?
- Like you say.

871
01:19:47,629 --> 01:19:51,690
Old man, pretty lady, two young 'uns.
One's a white boy, the other's a black.

872
01:19:51,767 --> 01:19:53,428
That's them, captain.

873
01:19:53,502 --> 01:19:56,266
- How long ago?
- l just come from there.

874
01:19:56,338 --> 01:19:59,307
That means they're taking
the Yulee Railroad to Tampa.

875
01:19:59,374 --> 01:20:01,706
They think they're gonna lose me.

876
01:20:01,777 --> 01:20:06,077
- They will if we don't get after 'em.
- Relax, Catrell.

877
01:20:06,148 --> 01:20:08,412
They don't know it yet,

878
01:20:08,484 --> 01:20:13,547
but they just bought themselves
a one-way ticket.

879
01:20:21,296 --> 01:20:24,265
That's it.
Tuck it in there, right snug, like.

880
01:20:25,634 --> 01:20:27,966
(Davie) Here comes Dr. Snodgrass.

881
01:20:30,072 --> 01:20:32,404
We're ready to leave, Doctor.
We're ready.

882
01:20:32,474 --> 01:20:35,238
Had a lengthy chat
with a Reverend Macilroy.

883
01:20:35,344 --> 01:20:39,610
No persons answering the description
of Spangler and his crew

884
01:20:39,681 --> 01:20:43,947
have been seen in Tampa,
so our strategy seems to be working.

885
01:20:44,019 --> 01:20:46,180
Shall we leave, Doctor?

886
01:20:46,288 --> 01:20:49,621
Do you wish us to settle our account
for our supplies now?

887
01:20:49,691 --> 01:20:51,716
Oh, when we get to our destination.

888
01:20:51,793 --> 01:20:53,761
Destina...? Oh, yes, of course.

889
01:20:53,862 --> 01:20:56,888
l can manage.

890
01:20:56,965 --> 01:20:59,126
- Give me a hand.
- Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.

891
01:21:00,202 --> 01:21:05,071
But l must admit, it'll be the first
trip l've made through the swamp

892
01:21:05,140 --> 01:21:08,075
without having an idea
of where l was heading.

893
01:21:08,143 --> 01:21:12,477
We'll tell you where you're headed
once we're through the Everglades.

894
01:21:12,548 --> 01:21:15,176
Yes, ma'am, all right. Shall we leave?

895
01:21:15,250 --> 01:21:17,810
- Shall we go?
- Are we ready? One, two, and in!

896
01:21:37,272 --> 01:21:40,036
Oh, there's your snowy egret, Thad,

897
01:21:40,108 --> 01:21:42,838
one of nature's
most beautiful creatures.

898
01:21:42,911 --> 01:21:46,244
'Tis that. And them feathers'd make you
a lovely hat, missus.

899
01:21:47,216 --> 01:21:49,684
They look just fine where they are,
thank you.

900
01:21:49,751 --> 01:21:52,777
He was just trying to be nice.

901
01:21:52,854 --> 01:21:57,314
l don't like that man.
l just don't trust him.

902
01:22:06,368 --> 01:22:09,462
Lift your paddles just high enough
so as to clear the water.

903
01:22:09,538 --> 01:22:11,699
lt'll save your strength that way.

904
01:22:11,773 --> 01:22:14,207
A little water wouldn't hurt, you know.

905
01:22:15,344 --> 01:22:19,110
A little water wouldn't hurt you
none either, Mr. Skaggs.

906
01:22:23,218 --> 01:22:25,186
Oh.

907
01:22:28,824 --> 01:22:30,519
Oh, it's Seminole.

908
01:22:30,592 --> 01:22:34,688
They're friendly enough,
so long as you don't cross 'em.

909
01:23:18,006 --> 01:23:20,338
Ease off your paddles a bit.

910
01:23:21,543 --> 01:23:24,376
Do you mind...
Do you mind if we stop for a moment?

911
01:23:24,446 --> 01:23:28,974
l'm not as young
or as buoyant as the rest of you.

912
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:42,922
Hey, take your hands out of the water.
This is gator country.

913
01:23:42,998 --> 01:23:47,458
- l don't see no gators.
- Oh, you don't? Well, they're here.

914
01:23:47,536 --> 01:23:50,471
And l'll show you.

915
01:23:58,747 --> 01:24:01,113
There! See 'em?

916
01:24:01,183 --> 01:24:04,550
Yeah... Ooh, sit down, lad!

917
01:24:04,653 --> 01:24:08,020
Sit down! You get us in that water,
we'll be lunch for the gators.

918
01:24:09,124 --> 01:24:12,685
Now, if you should ever tussle with one,
get underneath him,

919
01:24:12,761 --> 01:24:15,127
because a gator can't move
his lower jaw.

920
01:24:15,230 --> 01:24:18,859
lt's a pity some humans
are not similarly handicapped.

921
01:24:25,907 --> 01:24:30,139
- l think we'd better leave, Doctor.
- Perhaps you're right.

922
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:34,640
What noise do you make
to frighten these things?

923
01:24:41,022 --> 01:24:42,512
Oh, perhaps not.

924
01:24:53,935 --> 01:24:56,904
There's not a breath of air
in this place.

925
01:25:05,647 --> 01:25:08,946
All right, lads.
Bear to the left now. To the left.

926
01:25:10,352 --> 01:25:13,048
Left? l thought south
would be in that direction.

927
01:25:13,855 --> 01:25:17,916
Oh, aye, you're quite right. Very good
sense of direction you've got there.

928
01:25:17,993 --> 01:25:23,556
You see, that channel plugs up about
a mile further on, so we turn left.

929
01:25:24,299 --> 01:25:26,199
Ah.

930
01:25:31,773 --> 01:25:34,207
Come on, pull. Let's get in here.

931
01:25:37,679 --> 01:25:39,647
Let's stop there.

932
01:25:40,749 --> 01:25:42,114
What for?

933
01:25:42,217 --> 01:25:45,380
Well, it's the last good watering spot
for 50 miles, ma'am.

934
01:25:45,454 --> 01:25:48,116
l think we'd better
get our water here, right?

935
01:25:48,190 --> 01:25:51,648
- l'll help you, Mr. Skaggs.
- Thank you, Davie.

936
01:26:03,104 --> 01:26:06,938
l told you l know a night crawler
when l see one.

937
01:26:09,711 --> 01:26:11,941
Out of the boat, all of you.

938
01:26:29,498 --> 01:26:32,661
Now, Miss High And Mighty,

939
01:26:32,767 --> 01:26:35,998
l'm giving the orders around here.

940
01:26:36,638 --> 01:26:39,004
Get out of there. You defile that boat.

941
01:26:39,074 --> 01:26:41,042
Jump, woman! Jump!

942
01:26:46,581 --> 01:26:48,344
l said jump!

943
01:27:00,095 --> 01:27:04,657
Now, Master Davie, come here.

944
01:27:08,837 --> 01:27:12,500
You led us a merry chase,
but now it's over, you understand?

945
01:27:13,375 --> 01:27:15,434
l believe you have a map.

946
01:27:15,510 --> 01:27:18,877
l lost it, but l know
where the treasure is.

947
01:27:19,881 --> 01:27:21,849
Timbuktu, extreme southern...

948
01:27:21,950 --> 01:27:23,975
He's only a lad!

949
01:27:24,052 --> 01:27:25,815
Oh!

950
01:27:26,721 --> 01:27:28,951
l intend to get that map.

951
01:27:29,024 --> 01:27:31,993
He's telling the truth.
He lost it in the river.

952
01:27:32,093 --> 01:27:36,427
Then why are you all here?
He knows where the gold is.

953
01:27:38,700 --> 01:27:43,569
Now out with it, or l'll be forced
to do something very unpleasant

954
01:27:43,638 --> 01:27:46,106
for the both of us, especially you.

955
01:27:49,578 --> 01:27:53,639
He means it, Davie.
You tell him what you remember.

956
01:27:55,550 --> 01:27:58,314
Where is it?

957
01:27:58,420 --> 01:28:00,581
l don't know.

958
01:28:04,225 --> 01:28:05,385
No!

959
01:28:05,460 --> 01:28:07,724
l have a map of sorts.

960
01:28:14,703 --> 01:28:19,970
l thought it wiser to commit the map
to something less fallible than memory.

961
01:28:21,343 --> 01:28:23,834
Thank the Lord for that.

962
01:28:27,749 --> 01:28:30,047
Whitewater Cove.

963
01:28:30,118 --> 01:28:32,882
Huh. Matecumbe Key.

964
01:28:33,888 --> 01:28:37,255
Here, these trees.
We find them, we find the gold.

965
01:28:38,593 --> 01:28:41,653
All right, man the boats,
ours and theirs.

966
01:28:42,731 --> 01:28:45,222
You're not going to leave us here?

967
01:28:47,068 --> 01:28:51,232
My apologies, madam,
but if we leave you a boat,

968
01:28:51,339 --> 01:28:55,207
you might just find a way out of here.

969
01:28:56,611 --> 01:28:59,045
You won't starve to death, lady.

970
01:28:59,114 --> 01:29:01,275
Mosquitoes'll get you long before that.

971
01:29:05,320 --> 01:29:08,255
Excuse me, Doctor, but...

972
01:29:08,323 --> 01:29:11,417
...you won't be needing this now,
will you?

973
01:29:11,493 --> 01:29:12,517
Thank you.

974
01:29:16,698 --> 01:29:18,427
Ma'am.

975
01:30:16,357 --> 01:30:20,418
Careful. Don't smother it.
Don't smother it.

976
01:30:33,174 --> 01:30:35,904
What are you...?
Where are you...? No! No!

977
01:30:36,611 --> 01:30:39,307
No, you'd choke out here.
You'll choke out here.

978
01:30:39,380 --> 01:30:42,008
They'll get into your neck,
your nose and mouth.

979
01:30:42,083 --> 01:30:46,520
You won't be able to breathe. Take that.
Come on, that's better.

980
01:30:46,588 --> 01:30:49,284
- Come on.

981
01:30:59,434 --> 01:31:01,868
- Will this kill 'em?
- Some of them, perhaps.

982
01:31:01,936 --> 01:31:04,200
But when the rain is over,
they'll be back,

983
01:31:04,272 --> 01:31:08,038
and then, whatever help the smoke was,
there'll be nothing to burn.

984
01:31:08,109 --> 01:31:10,236
- What's that?

985
01:31:11,012 --> 01:31:13,640
Rain!

986
01:31:13,715 --> 01:31:17,242
- Don't you hear nothing?
- l hear it.

987
01:31:17,318 --> 01:31:20,219
Like singing!

988
01:31:20,288 --> 01:31:24,156
lf we don't make some noise, Charlie,
how will anyone know we're around?

989
01:31:24,225 --> 01:31:28,161
- Sing along.
- Help! Help!

990
01:31:28,229 --> 01:31:30,857
- Help!
- Help!

991
01:31:30,932 --> 01:31:32,490
- Over here!
- Help!

992
01:31:40,008 --> 01:31:41,669
- Shh!
- Help!

993
01:31:41,743 --> 01:31:45,474
- Help!
- Can't you hear? Help us there!

994
01:31:45,547 --> 01:31:47,242
- Help!
- Help!

995
01:31:48,082 --> 01:31:49,845
Hey!

996
01:31:49,918 --> 01:31:51,886
- Jim!
- Uncle Jim!

997
01:31:55,690 --> 01:31:58,056
Uncle Jim! You're here! You're here!

998
01:31:58,126 --> 01:32:00,686
Of course.
We're in this together, aren't we?

999
01:32:05,700 --> 01:32:10,433
You all seem
a little the worse for wear.

1000
01:32:10,505 --> 01:32:14,066
- Where's Cooter Skaggs?
- We were abandoned by our guide.

1001
01:32:14,175 --> 01:32:18,236
- He was in league with Spangler.
- Spangler?

1002
01:32:18,313 --> 01:32:20,008
- Yeah.
- He's here?

1003
01:32:20,081 --> 01:32:22,982
He went to go get the treasure.
They know where it is.

1004
01:32:23,051 --> 01:32:26,714
- How much ahead are they?
- They left sometime this afternoon.

1005
01:32:28,223 --> 01:32:31,522
- Maybe we can beat 'em.
- Oh!

1006
01:32:31,593 --> 01:32:34,721
We've been deserted
and almost ate alive by mosquitoes

1007
01:32:34,796 --> 01:32:39,165
and all you care about
is that unholy gold.

1008
01:32:39,267 --> 01:32:41,758
You're pretty
even when you're wet and angry.

1009
01:32:41,836 --> 01:32:46,296
You had us thinking you were dead.
Probably dead drunk in some saloon.

1010
01:32:46,374 --> 01:32:48,342
And if you were alive,

1011
01:32:48,409 --> 01:32:53,369
why did you have us go off
with that horrible, horrible man?

1012
01:32:53,448 --> 01:32:56,542
You smell to high heaven.

1013
01:32:58,953 --> 01:33:02,116
Mosquitoes don't like it much, either.
lt's an ointment.

1014
01:33:02,190 --> 01:33:04,351
- What did you say?
- Mosquitoes.

1015
01:33:04,425 --> 01:33:08,589
- They don't like it much, either.
- No, before that.

1016
01:33:10,498 --> 01:33:12,466
l said you're pretty.

1017
01:33:13,735 --> 01:33:17,796
l've been meaning to tell you that
ever since l first saw you.

1018
01:33:17,872 --> 01:33:21,205
But l had a rope around my neck and...

1019
01:33:36,157 --> 01:33:38,523
Are we ready now?

1020
01:33:51,372 --> 01:33:55,138
When l got to Tampa, l beat the bushes
till l found my old friend Charlie.

1021
01:33:55,243 --> 01:34:00,340
Then Charlie and l picked up the same
trail Spangler left for Cooter Skaggs.

1022
01:34:00,415 --> 01:34:02,542
We were...

1023
01:34:02,617 --> 01:34:04,585
What on earth...?

1024
01:34:05,853 --> 01:34:08,014
- Cougar.
- Cougar?

1025
01:34:09,257 --> 01:34:12,590
lt's an lndian tribe,
part of the Seminoles.

1026
01:34:12,660 --> 01:34:17,324
- They friendly with your people?
- Nobody's friends. Bad.

1027
01:34:17,398 --> 01:34:21,095
Bad?
Do you think they've seen us?

1028
01:34:21,169 --> 01:34:23,467
They see, long time now.

1029
01:34:23,538 --> 01:34:26,234
Why can't we see them?

1030
01:34:26,975 --> 01:34:28,943
They don't want us to.

1031
01:35:25,266 --> 01:35:27,632
What do you think, Charlie?

1032
01:35:27,702 --> 01:35:28,964
Hurricane.

1033
01:35:29,804 --> 01:35:31,066
Hurricane?

1034
01:35:34,709 --> 01:35:38,338
- Stay here. Better.
- Why stay here?

1035
01:35:38,413 --> 01:35:41,439
A beach on the open sea's
no place to be in a hurricane.

1036
01:35:41,516 --> 01:35:44,041
But Spangler won't stop.

1037
01:35:44,118 --> 01:35:46,780
lf we all end up
at the bottom of the sea, Davie,

1038
01:35:46,854 --> 01:35:49,345
we won't have gained much, will we?

1039
01:35:52,627 --> 01:35:54,595
lt's so still.

1040
01:35:54,695 --> 01:35:58,597
Charlie not wrong. Birds not wrong.

1041
01:36:05,306 --> 01:36:08,867
We're almost there, aren't we?

1042
01:36:18,019 --> 01:36:21,580
With luck, we can beat it.
Let's make a run for it.

1043
01:37:12,306 --> 01:37:14,274
There's the trees!

1044
01:37:19,480 --> 01:37:21,448
Stay together!

1045
01:37:34,162 --> 01:37:36,130
Jim!

1046
01:37:39,934 --> 01:37:41,902
Keep going!

1047
01:37:52,113 --> 01:37:56,072
- Charlie!
- Charlie, are you all right?

1048
01:37:56,184 --> 01:37:58,277
- Can you get up?
- Oh, Charlie.

1049
01:37:58,352 --> 01:38:00,320
Charlie all right.

1050
01:38:02,056 --> 01:38:04,024
Give me your hand!

1051
01:38:07,461 --> 01:38:09,429
Come on!

1052
01:38:10,498 --> 01:38:13,467
Try and dig in!

1053
01:38:13,534 --> 01:38:15,502
Over there! Turn out!

1054
01:38:40,228 --> 01:38:41,661
Look out!

1055
01:39:00,982 --> 01:39:03,450
- Thad!
- Davie.

1056
01:39:03,517 --> 01:39:05,985
- Look!
- lt's the gold for sure.

1057
01:39:06,053 --> 01:39:07,418
- Look!
- Go on.

1058
01:39:07,521 --> 01:39:09,489
Go and get Uncle Jim!

1059
01:39:13,494 --> 01:39:16,588
Uncle Jim! Uncle Jim!

1060
01:39:18,266 --> 01:39:21,793
Over by Davie! He's found something!

1061
01:39:21,869 --> 01:39:23,837
Run!

1062
01:39:46,127 --> 01:39:49,392
- lt is!
- Look at that, Thad!

1063
01:39:53,167 --> 01:39:55,727
We did it! Yeah! Hey!

1064
01:40:38,312 --> 01:40:39,870
Doctor!

1065
01:40:43,984 --> 01:40:48,512
- Snodgrass!
- Doctor!

1066
01:40:48,589 --> 01:40:50,523
No!

1067
01:40:50,591 --> 01:40:53,116
Behind you! Doctor!

1068
01:41:00,468 --> 01:41:02,368
Oh, no!

1069
01:41:02,436 --> 01:41:04,301
Dr. Snodgrass!

1070
01:41:06,707 --> 01:41:09,198
No!

1071
01:41:11,412 --> 01:41:14,575
No, Doctor!

1072
01:41:24,925 --> 01:41:28,827
- Come on, boys.
- No!

1073
01:41:28,896 --> 01:41:31,626
No, it's no use. Come on.

1074
01:41:35,536 --> 01:41:37,504
lnto the woods!

1075
01:41:39,206 --> 01:41:41,174
Go on!

1076
01:41:44,845 --> 01:41:46,813
Hurry! Keep it moving!

1077
01:42:12,807 --> 01:42:16,106
Davie! Davie!

1078
01:42:47,775 --> 01:42:51,643
Uncle Jim! Uncle Jim!

1079
01:42:52,346 --> 01:42:55,179
- Davie!
- l'm down here!

1080
01:42:55,249 --> 01:42:57,809
Get me outta here!

1081
01:43:05,259 --> 01:43:07,227
Stay there!

1082
01:43:23,777 --> 01:43:25,210
Chief's tomb.

1083
01:43:25,279 --> 01:43:28,112
You'll be safer down there than up here.
Come on.

1084
01:43:45,533 --> 01:43:49,094
- What's he doing?
- Calming the spirits.

1085
01:43:49,169 --> 01:43:52,730
Matecumbe
Cougar sacred burial ground.

1086
01:43:57,177 --> 01:44:00,635
We'll have more than spirits
to worry about if the Cougar find us.

1087
01:44:00,714 --> 01:44:03,615
- Will they kill us?
- No kill.

1088
01:44:03,684 --> 01:44:06,050
Cougar make wear cockatiel all time.

1089
01:44:06,120 --> 01:44:09,487
- Cockatiel?
- Make squaws out of us.

1090
01:44:10,558 --> 01:44:12,492
Slaves for the rest of our lives.

1091
01:45:03,777 --> 01:45:06,109
Not a sign of him.

1092
01:45:07,681 --> 01:45:10,172
l searched the beach a mile each way.

1093
01:45:13,587 --> 01:45:15,851
Gold.

1094
01:45:15,923 --> 01:45:19,552
Some jewelry. Mostly coins.

1095
01:45:24,331 --> 01:45:26,094
Jim.

1096
01:45:30,871 --> 01:45:33,237
- Cougar coming.
- Let's go.

1097
01:45:56,664 --> 01:45:58,996
lt's Spangler!

1098
01:45:59,066 --> 01:46:01,034
Hold your fire!

1099
01:46:03,437 --> 01:46:05,769
We want the gold, Bernie.

1100
01:46:05,839 --> 01:46:08,774
Leave it! Then get outta there.

1101
01:46:08,842 --> 01:46:11,402
- You're not gonna give it to him?
- Shh!

1102
01:46:11,512 --> 01:46:13,480
Cougar hear gun, find us.

1103
01:46:15,849 --> 01:46:18,018
- That may not be all bad.
- We won't wait any longer!

1104
01:46:18,018 --> 01:46:19,178
- That may not be all bad.
- We won't wait any longer!

1105
01:46:20,621 --> 01:46:24,318
l want the gold. l want the gold now!

1106
01:46:24,391 --> 01:46:26,757
You and the boys get outta here. Hide.

1107
01:46:26,860 --> 01:46:30,193
- Just give it to him.
- Do as l say.

1108
01:46:33,934 --> 01:46:37,700
lt's yours!
But l'm taking you at your word.

1109
01:46:37,771 --> 01:46:41,036
We want safe passage outta here.

1110
01:46:41,108 --> 01:46:45,340
You have my word! As a gentleman.

1111
01:46:47,147 --> 01:46:49,980
All right, let's grab it and run.

1112
01:48:19,773 --> 01:48:21,741
Got too heavy for 'em.

1113
01:48:33,587 --> 01:48:35,555
Ooh.

1114
01:48:37,858 --> 01:48:39,416
Ah.

1115
01:49:00,080 --> 01:49:04,813
Take it. Take the treasure to the boats.
Take the treasure to the boats!

1116
01:49:45,492 --> 01:49:47,460
Where are they?

1117
01:49:56,904 --> 01:49:58,872
l'm getting out of here!

1118
01:50:00,440 --> 01:50:01,737
Wait!

1119
01:50:01,808 --> 01:50:05,369
Come on! Come on back here and fight!

1120
01:50:08,282 --> 01:50:11,115
Come on, you yellow-stomached rats!

1121
01:51:18,452 --> 01:51:21,910
Chief, l don't know nothing
about these other fellas,

1122
01:51:21,989 --> 01:51:24,617
but l am part-Mohawk
on me mother's side.

1123
01:51:26,326 --> 01:51:29,989
Good. Mohawk made good squaw.

1124
01:51:31,031 --> 01:51:32,726
Squaw?

1125
01:51:32,799 --> 01:51:34,767
Go.

1126
01:52:23,116 --> 01:52:25,016
Come, squaw.

1127
01:52:29,523 --> 01:52:31,491
Squaw.

1128
01:52:47,607 --> 01:52:50,974
Nearly journey's end, Davie.
You've got the Bernie treasure.

1129
01:52:52,879 --> 01:52:55,541
All l want is enough to fix up Grassy.

1130
01:52:55,615 --> 01:52:59,244
We'll split up the rest.
That all right with you, Thad?

1131
01:53:00,420 --> 01:53:02,547
Yeah.

1132
01:53:04,624 --> 01:53:07,593
- Snodgrass.
- Dr. Snodgrass!

1133
01:53:07,694 --> 01:53:09,719
Dr. Snodgrass!

1134
01:53:09,796 --> 01:53:12,424
- Dr. Snodgrass!
- Snodgrass!

1135
01:53:12,499 --> 01:53:14,467
- Doctor!
- Doctor.

1136
01:53:29,483 --> 01:53:32,043
Are you all right, Dr. Snodgrass?

1137
01:53:32,152 --> 01:53:35,087
A slight separation
of the femur and the tibia.

1138
01:53:35,155 --> 01:53:38,921
A minor visitation
for a man of my constitution.

1139
01:53:39,025 --> 01:53:42,984
- l never thought we'd see you again.
- The sea couldn't hold me, sir.

1140
01:53:43,096 --> 01:53:46,998
l was beached by an immense
yet understanding wave.

1141
01:53:48,135 --> 01:53:52,572
l know what the English say
about bad pennies, Doc,

1142
01:53:52,639 --> 01:53:55,130
but l'm awfully glad
to see you're alive.

1143
01:53:57,477 --> 01:53:59,445
Oh, my dear.

1144
01:54:00,480 --> 01:54:04,644
Oh, Thad. Thad, Thad. Thank you.

1145
01:54:04,718 --> 01:54:08,051
Dr. Snodgrass,
l told God if He saved you,

1146
01:54:08,121 --> 01:54:10,885
l'd do exactly like you say,

1147
01:54:10,957 --> 01:54:14,518
learn everything l can
so as you can be proud of me.

1148
01:54:15,629 --> 01:54:19,360
Well, He obviously kept
His part of the bargain.

1149
01:54:19,432 --> 01:54:24,096
So from now on, Thad,
your course is clearly charted.

1150
01:54:24,171 --> 01:54:28,039
Come along, then. You seem to have had
a very easy time of it, you others.

1151
01:54:28,108 --> 01:54:30,076
Oh!

1152
01:54:30,143 --> 01:54:32,509
l had the most harrowing experience.

1153
01:54:32,579 --> 01:54:34,877
Let me tell you about it.

1154
01:54:34,948 --> 01:54:36,916
At the risk of boring myself...

1155
01:54:40,921 --> 01:54:45,017
Dr. Snodgrass, are you really English?

1156
01:54:46,193 --> 01:54:51,529
Only at times, Thad.
Only at... at times.

1157
01:54:51,598 --> 01:54:55,625
Dr. Snodgrass, why don't you
come and stay with us at Grassy?

1158
01:54:55,702 --> 01:54:59,001
At Grassy?
Oh, l should be honored, Davie.

1159
01:54:59,072 --> 01:55:02,098
But l can't in good conscience
forego my duty

1160
01:55:02,175 --> 01:55:04,837
towards those poor unfortunates
along the river

1161
01:55:04,911 --> 01:55:09,814
who await my call
with such impatience every year.

1162
01:55:10,984 --> 01:55:13,214
But it's good to know
that you and Grassy

1163
01:55:13,286 --> 01:55:16,119
will always be there to offer sanctuary.

1164
01:55:16,189 --> 01:55:19,215
Know that the friendships

1165
01:55:19,292 --> 01:55:23,023
that were forged
in the crucible of our adversity

1166
01:55:23,096 --> 01:55:25,064
shall not tarnish

1167
01:55:25,131 --> 01:55:29,227
nor their temper e'er lose.

1168
01:55:31,204 --> 01:55:33,172
What'd he say?
