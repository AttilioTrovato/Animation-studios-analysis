1
00:02:37,725 --> 00:02:40,194
GOOD EVENING, SIR.
I'M PROFESSOR IVARSSON.

2
00:02:40,228 --> 00:02:42,196
YES, SIR. SIR ANTHONY'S
BEEN EXPECTING YOU.

3
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,998
IT'S IN YOUR HANDS, MARLOW.
STAND FAST WITH THOSE
STEEL FELLOWS.

4
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:48,836
THEY'LL COME TO TERMS. IF
ANY OTHER PROBLEMS COME UP,
CONSULT WITH THE BOARD.

5
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:52,139
THEY KNOW MY THINKING.
AH! PROFESSOR IVARSSON.

6
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,342
I CANNOT TELL YOU
HOW GRATEFUL I AM...

7
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:57,645
THAT YOU'VE AGREED
TO JOIN ME.
I HAVEN'T AGREED TO ANYTHING.

8
00:02:57,678 --> 00:03:01,715
ALL I KNOW IS THAT SOMEBODY
WOKE ME UP AT 6:00 YESTERDAY
MORNING SAYING HE WAS...

9
00:03:01,749 --> 00:03:04,385
THE BRITISH AMBASSADOR.
IT WAS THE
BRITISH AMBASSADOR.

10
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:07,355
HE'D ARRANGED MY PASSAGE
ON A MAIL BOAT FROM NORWAY
TO ENGLAND.

11
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:10,558
THEN A LARGE MAN
APPEARED AT MY DOOR.
HE HELPED ME PACK MY BAGS...

12
00:03:10,591 --> 00:03:13,394
AND DROVE ME TO THE DOCK.
YOUR TRAIN LEAVES
IN TEN MINUTES, SIR.

13
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:18,031
GOOD. COME ALONG, IVARSSON.
BUT, UH, SIR ANTHONY...

14
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:21,235
AN EXPEDITION
TO THE ARCTIC?

15
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:25,939
I'M... I'M HARDLY A
PROFESSIONAL EXPLORER...
AH, LET ME FINISH.

16
00:03:25,973 --> 00:03:28,576
I'VE HAD YOU
LOOKED INTO.
OH?

17
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:31,011
YOU'RE AN AMERICAN FROM
THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,

18
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,547
CURRENTLY A GUEST LECTURER AT
THE UNIVERSITY OF CHRISTIANIA.

19
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:36,384
YOUR SPECIALITY
IS THE ARCHAEOLOGY
OF THE NORTH.

20
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:40,588
IN THE PAST, YOU'VE LED
SEVERAL SUCCESSFUL EXPEDITIONS.

21
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:42,623
YOU'VE DONE SOME VERY
INTERESTING WORK IN GREENLAND.

22
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:45,926
OH, NO, NO.
YOU'RE THE RIGHT MAN
FOR THE JOB, ALL RIGHT.

23
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:50,298
THE RIGHT MAN FOR WHAT JOB?
AND WHAT'S SO URGENT?
WHAT IS IT YOU HOPE TO FIND?

24
00:03:51,399 --> 00:03:55,168
MY... SON.

25
00:03:58,105 --> 00:04:02,443
YOU SEE, MY WIFE DIED
WHEN DONALD WAS A CHILD.

26
00:04:02,476 --> 00:04:05,579
AS HE GREW OLDER,
I BEGAN TO GROOM HIM...

27
00:04:05,613 --> 00:04:07,415
TO TAKE MY PLACE
IN THE BUSINESS.

28
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:11,585
I PUSHED HIM TOO HARD.
I... ANYWAY, WE HAD WORDS.

29
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:15,556
THEN SUDDENLY DONALD DROPPED
EVERYTHING AND WENT OFF
ON A WHALING SHIP...

30
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,758
AS AN ORDINARY SEAMAN.

31
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:22,796
THREE MONTHS LATER,
I GOT WORD THAT HE'D LEFT
THE SHIP IN BAFFIN LAND.

32
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:26,967
WHY?
I HAD NO IDEA...

33
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,737
UNTIL I RECEIVED THIS
FROM A TRADING POST

34
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,306
AT FORT CONGER
ON ELLESMERE ISLAND.

35
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:35,909
APPARENTLY, DONALD HAD
LEFT IT WITH THE FACTOR
FOR SAFEKEEPING...

36
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:39,246
WHEN HE'D GONE OFF ON
SOME SORT OF EXPEDITION.

37
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:44,318
WHEN HE DIDN'T COME BACK,
THE FACTOR SENT IT ON TO ME.

38
00:04:44,352 --> 00:04:47,988
HMM. IT'S AN OLD PAGE
FROM A HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY
JOURNAL.

39
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:53,160
LOOK AT THE ENTRY
FOR JANUARY 15, 1856.

40
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:58,599
"TO THIS POST THIS DAY
CAME JOHN MURCHISON
WITH HIS ESKIMOS,

41
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:03,371
"WHO HUNT THE WHITE BEAR
FAR BEYOND THE LAND'S END.

42
00:05:03,404 --> 00:05:08,208
"HE TOLD OF SEEING
A LONE CLOUD AS IF
LYING ON THE ICE,

43
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:12,880
"AND HIDDEN BENEATH IT,
AN ISLAND.

44
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:15,048
"THIS ISLAND
HE SOUGHT TO EXAMINE,

45
00:05:15,082 --> 00:05:18,386
"BUT HIS ESKIMOS
REFUSED HIM, SAYING...

46
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:21,489
"IT'S GUARDED
BY EVIL SPIRITS,

47
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:25,192
FOR IT'S THE PLACE WHERE
THE WHALES GO TO DIE."

48
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:27,327
WE'RE COMING
INTO DOVER NOW, SIR.

49
00:05:27,361 --> 00:05:30,498
THANK YOU.
SIR ANTHONY,
THE GRAVEYARD OF WHALES...

50
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:33,534
IS JUST A FANTASY,
A WHALER'S EL DORADO,

51
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:38,038
WHERE HE THINKS HE'S
GOING TO FIND A HUGE FORTUNE
IN WHALE BONE AND AMBERGRIS.

52
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:40,307
THE FACT IS,
IT SIMPLY DOESN'T EXIST.

53
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,510
GRAVEYARD OF WHALES
IS A LEGEND, NOTHING MORE.

54
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:46,714
A LEGEND OR NOT,
THE GRAVEYARD IS WHAT
MY SON WENT AFTER.

55
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:48,916
IT'S MY SON
I'M LOOKING FOR.

56
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:55,055
PORTER, SIR?
YES, TAKE OUR LUGGAGE
TO THE ADMIRALTY PIER.

57
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:57,157
VERY GOOD, SIR.
SIR ANTHONY,

58
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,093
I'M AFRAID THIS HAS TO BE
THE END OF THE LINE FOR ME.

59
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:03,363
I'D HELP IF I COULD.
I KNOW HOW MUCH
THIS MEANS TO YOU.

60
00:06:03,397 --> 00:06:06,767
BUT YOU'RE TRYING
THE IMPOSSIBLE:
TO TRY TO FIND ONE MAN...

61
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,703
WITH NOTHING MORE
TO GO ON THAN A PAGE
FROM AN OLD JOURNAL...

62
00:06:09,737 --> 00:06:14,241
THERE IS SOMETHING MORE.
DONALD ALSO LEFT THIS
WITH THE FACTOR.

63
00:06:14,274 --> 00:06:16,944
I WAS HOPING YOU
MIGHT KNOW WHAT IT WAS.

64
00:06:18,546 --> 00:06:21,048
IT'S CARVED BONE.
IT'S ESKIMO WORK.

65
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:23,917
IT'S QUITE COMMON
IN THE ARCTIC.

66
00:06:23,951 --> 00:06:25,919
THIS ONE'S A KIND OF A MAP.
MAP?

67
00:06:25,953 --> 00:06:29,923
IF I HAD THE RIGHT CHART,
I COULD SHOW YOU HOW
THIS THING WORKS.

68
00:06:29,957 --> 00:06:31,425
MY YACHT IS AT THE PIER.

69
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:33,393
YOU CAN HAVE ALL THE CHARTS
YOU NEED.

70
00:06:38,566 --> 00:06:40,734
THIS PATTERN HOPEFULLY
WILL CORRESPOND...

71
00:06:40,768 --> 00:06:44,438
TO SOME PART OF THE SHORELINE
HERE ON THE CHART.

72
00:06:46,974 --> 00:06:49,977
LOOK. SEE HOW
THIS MATCHES?

73
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,112
IT'S NOT EXACTLY
TO SCALE, OF COURSE.

74
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:55,749
THEN THIS RED MARK COULD BE
THE ISLAND WE'RE LOOKING FOR.

75
00:06:55,783 --> 00:06:57,485
IF THERE WERE SUCH AN ISLAND.

76
00:06:57,518 --> 00:07:00,287
AND WHY SHOULDN'T
THERE BE?
'CAUSE THERE'S NO LAND HERE.

77
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:04,324
IT'S JUST A GIGANTIC FROZEN SEA.
ALL THE EXPLORERS AGREE TO THAT.

78
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:08,696
PEARY, NANSEN, ALL OF THEM.
AND WHAT IS
IVARSSON'S OPINION?

79
00:07:12,332 --> 00:07:15,002
OF COURSE, THERE'S
A LOT THEY HAVEN'T COVERED.

80
00:07:16,303 --> 00:07:18,972
BUT IF THERE WERE
SUCH AN ISLAND,

81
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:21,975
IF THE GRAVEYARD OF WHALES
REALLY DID EXIST...

82
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:24,812
THE WORLD WILL NEVER KNOW,
WILL IT?

83
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:27,180
UNLESS YOU DISCOVER IT.

84
00:07:27,214 --> 00:07:31,451
OR UNLESS SOMEONE ELSE
BEATS YOU TO IT.

85
00:07:31,485 --> 00:07:33,787
SIR ANTHONY,

86
00:07:33,821 --> 00:07:36,256
YOU'RE A DEVIOUS MAN.

87
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,359
YES, I AM, AREN'T I?

88
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:42,195
I'VE GOT YOUR
CONTRACT HERE,

89
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:44,532
YOUR LEAVE FROM
THE UNIVERSITY,
POWER OF ATTORNEY.

90
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:48,035
MY SOLICITORS WILL
HANDLE YOUR AFFAIRS
IN YOUR ABSENCE.

91
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:51,972
WE'RE UNDERWAY.
AND HAVE BEEN
FOR SOME TIME.

92
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:53,941
WE'LL BE IN FRANCE
IN THE MORNING.

93
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:58,311
WHY FRANCE? THAT'S HARDLY
THE MOST DIRECT ROUTE
TO FORT CONGER.

94
00:07:58,345 --> 00:08:01,248
ON THE CONTRARY.
I THINK YOU'LL FIND
THAT IT IS.

95
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:11,291
CAN'T YOU SLOW HIM DOWN?

96
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:15,028
YOU'D THINK WE WERE
LEAVING TOMORROW MORNING.
WE ARE.

97
00:08:15,062 --> 00:08:18,666
WHAT?
I SAID WE ARE.

98
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:21,869
FIRST THING
IN THE MORNING.
IMPOSSIBLE!

99
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:26,239
IT'S WINTER. NO SHIP
CAN GET THROUGH THE ICE
BEFORE SPRING.

100
00:08:26,273 --> 00:08:30,377
I'VE MADE
OTHER ARRANGEMENTS.
WHAT ARRANGEMENTS?

101
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:34,347
IF I TOLD YOU,
YOU'D THINK I WAS MAD.

102
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:46,927
SIR ANTHONY,
YOU ARE MAD.

103
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,797
NOW YOU'RE GOING TO MEET
ANOTHER MADMAN.
CAPTAIN BRIEUX!

104
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:54,735
AH! MONSIEUR ROSS!

105
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:56,704
WHAT A PLEASURE!

106
00:08:58,438 --> 00:09:01,074
HE WAS BUILDING THIS FOR
A SYNDICATE OF AMERICANS,

107
00:09:01,108 --> 00:09:03,711
BUT HE RAN THROUGH
ALL THEIR MONEY.

108
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:05,679
I HEARD OF THE PROJECT
AND TOOK IT OVER. AH!

109
00:09:05,713 --> 00:09:07,781
CAPTAIN BRIEUX!
GOOD EVENING,
SIR ANTHONY.

110
00:09:07,815 --> 00:09:10,050
PROFESSOR IVARSSON.
I'M HONORED,
PROFESSOR.

111
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:13,020
IT'S MY PLEASURE, CAPTAIN.
DO YOU MIND IF I TAKE
A CLOSER LOOK?
NO, NO, NO.

112
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:16,289
PLEASE. I'M PROUD
WE SHALL HAVE YOU WITH US
FOR THE CEREMONY TOMORROW.

113
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:18,926
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

114
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,930
WHAT CEREMONY?
WHY, THE FIRST FLIGHT
OF MY CREATION.

115
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:26,099
TOMORROW, THE WHOLE WORLD
WILL KNOW OF ME
AND MY HYPERION.

116
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:30,470
FRANCE WILL RULE THE AIR!
WHATEVER YOU'VE PLANNED,
CANCEL IT.

117
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:32,740
TOMORROW, WE LEAVE
FOR THE ARCTIC.

118
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:35,442
THE ARCTIC?

119
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:39,546
THE ARCTIC! SIR ANTHONY,
THAT'S RIDICULOUS!

120
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,782
IT CAN'T BE DONE!
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

121
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:45,452
WE WOULD NEED FOOD,
SUPPLIES, FUEL FOR
THE MOTORS!

122
00:09:45,485 --> 00:09:48,321
THE FUEL I LEAVE TO YOU,
CAPTAIN.

123
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:54,494
ALL OTHER NECESSITIES
HAVE BEEN AMPLY PROVIDED
BY MY STAFF.

124
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:06,106
MONSIEUR, I THINK
IT IS BEST THAT YOU AND I
HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING.

125
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:10,610
WE HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING.
I BOUGHT AND PAID FOR
YOUR AIRSHIP.

126
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:12,813
IT'S MINE.
I INTEND TO USE IT...

127
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:15,515
TO FIND MY SON WHO IS
LOST IN THE ARCTIC.

128
00:10:16,516 --> 00:10:19,486
BUT I CANNOT DO IT
WITHOUT YOUR HELP.

129
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,456
I CAN OFFER YOU NOTHING
EXCEPT HARDSHIP AND DANGER,

130
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:27,494
EXCEPT YOUR PLACE
IN HISTORY.

131
00:10:27,527 --> 00:10:30,497
HISTORY?
THINK OF IT,
CAPTAIN.

132
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:33,166
YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY
WHICH COMES BUT ONCE
IN A GENERATION.

133
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,504
THE WORLD WILL KNOW YOU,
NOT ONLY AS THE FIRST MAN
TO FLY OVER THE ARCTIC,

134
00:10:37,537 --> 00:10:42,375
BUT THE FIRST MAN,
PERHAPS, TO BRAVE
THE NORTH POLE ITSELF!

135
00:11:10,871 --> 00:11:14,307
TODAY WE MAKE HISTORY.
THERE SHOULD BE FLAGS,

136
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:18,045
MUSIC, A SPEECH
FROM THE PRESIDENT.

137
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:21,849
BUT WHAT DO WE HAVE?
TWO SMALL CHILDREN
AND A HERD OF GOATS.

138
00:11:21,882 --> 00:11:24,718
DON'T WORRY, CAPTAIN.
WHEN YOU BRING HER
BACK TO FRANCE,

139
00:11:24,752 --> 00:11:27,087
THE CELEBRATION'S
GONNA BREAK ALL RECORDS.

140
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,724
PAREZ, MON CAPITAINE.
TRES BIEN, MARCEL.
MES COMPLIMENTS.

141
00:11:30,758 --> 00:11:33,426
NOW WE ARE READY TO DEPART.
VERY GOOD, CAPTAIN.
CARRY ON.

142
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,764
SILENCE!
THERE WILL BE
NO SPEAKING.

143
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:59,753
MARCEL, LANCEZ
LE MOTEUR A BABORD.

144
00:11:59,787 --> 00:12:03,323
BIEN, MON CAPITAINE.
LANCEZ LE MOTEUR A BABORD!

145
00:12:05,993 --> 00:12:08,661
CONTACT!

146
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,745
LANCEZ LE MOTEUR
A TRIBORD.

147
00:12:31,518 --> 00:12:34,254
LIBEREZ LES CORDAGES.

148
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:36,423
LIBEREZ LES CORDAGES.

149
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:24,872
WELL, WE'RE
ON OUR WAY.

150
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:29,376
A GLORIOUS DAY, MESSIEURS.
WE RISE WITH THE SUN.

151
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:33,446
CONGRATULATIONS, CAPTAIN.
THIS'LL BE A MORNING
TO REMEMBER.

152
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:39,052
SOMETHING IN THE FOOD HAMPER
JUST BIT ME.

153
00:13:39,086 --> 00:13:41,688
THAT IS NOT THE FOOD HAMPER.
THAT IS, UH,

154
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:44,057
THE SMALL BOUDOIR OF JOSEPHINE.

155
00:13:44,091 --> 00:13:47,227
IT'S SOME KIND OF A DOG!

156
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,796
BUT OF COURSE.
THE BEST KIND. FRENCH.

157
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,665
I AM NOT INTERESTED

THIS ESKIMO MAP'S
A LITTLE VAGUE.

321
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:13,966
IT'S A LOT TO GAMBLE
ON A PIECE OF BONE.

322
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,635
HE'S NOT MUCH HELP
TO US EITHER.

323
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:18,837
DID YOU EXPECT HIM TO BE?

324
00:32:46,865 --> 00:32:49,501
SIR ANTHONY!
HUH?

325
00:32:49,535 --> 00:32:52,804
COME UP, PLEASE!
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT.

326
00:32:59,011 --> 00:33:00,979
WHAT IS IT?

327
00:33:01,013 --> 00:33:03,215
LOOK OVER THERE.

328
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:16,195
WHALES.
WHITE WHALES. BELUGA.
INDIGENOUS TO THE ARCTIC.

329
00:33:16,228 --> 00:33:18,164
NOW LOOK OVER THERE.

330
00:33:22,034 --> 00:33:24,703
I SAY, THAT ONE'S
QUITE DIFFERENT.

331
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:28,340
THE CALIFORNIA GREY.
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE FOUND
ONLY IN THE PACIFIC.

332
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:33,879
A NARWHAL,
THE UNICORN OF THE SEA.

333
00:33:33,912 --> 00:33:36,215
THAT'S A RARE SIGHT,
SIR ANTHONY.

334
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:52,298
BY JOVE, THERE ARE
WHALES EVERYWHERE!

335
00:33:53,432 --> 00:33:55,201
ALL KINDS OF WHALES.

336
00:33:55,234 --> 00:33:58,537
AND ALL MOVING
IN THE SAME DIRECTION.

337
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:00,672
EXACTLY.

338
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:04,543
SO THERE IS A PLACE
WHERE WHALES GO TO DIE.

339
00:34:04,576 --> 00:34:10,082
CAPTAIN! THAT BIG LEAD
OF OPEN WATER.

340
00:34:10,116 --> 00:34:12,318
FOLLOW IT!

341
00:34:23,129 --> 00:34:26,598
IF WE REALLY ARE
ON THE RIGHT TRACK, WE'D
HAVE SEEN SOMETHING BY NOW.

342
00:34:26,632 --> 00:34:29,735
LOOK. YOU REMEMBER
THE JOURNAL.

343
00:34:29,768 --> 00:34:33,439
"A LONE CLOUD,
AS IF LYING ON THE ICE."

344
00:34:33,472 --> 00:34:35,407
OOMIAK!

345
00:34:38,144 --> 00:34:40,312
IS THAT WHERE
THE ISLAND IS?

346
00:34:40,346 --> 00:34:42,114
WRONG WAY!
WRONG WAY!

347
00:34:42,148 --> 00:34:45,251
ISLAND NOT THAT WAY!
ISLAND BACK THIS WAY!

348
00:34:45,284 --> 00:34:48,287
HE JUST TOLD US
WHAT WE WANTED TO KNOW.
YES.

349
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,322
STEADY AS YOU GO,
CAPTAIN.

350
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:16,014
LOOK!

351
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:25,391
"AND HIDDEN BENEATH THE CLOUD,
AN ISLAND."

352
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:47,713
CAPTAIN! WHAT HAPPENED?

353
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,749
CAPTAIN!

354
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:01,993
CAPTAIN?
WHY ARE WE STOPPING?

355
00:36:02,027 --> 00:36:05,797
IN SUCH A CLOUD,
IT'S NOT SAFE TO PROCEED.
NOT SAFE?

356
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:08,667
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
I COULD NOT SEE
TO NAVIGATE.

357
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,569
AND THERE WILL BE
STRONG WINDS.

358
00:36:10,602 --> 00:36:14,373
MY AIRSHIP COULD BE DASHED
AGAINST HIDDEN CLIFFS
AND TORN APART.

359
00:36:14,406 --> 00:36:16,141
WE CAN'T TURN BACK NOW.

360
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:20,579
WE DON'T HAVE TO.
WE CAN GO IN ON FOOT.

361
00:36:20,612 --> 00:36:23,181
OH.
CAPITAL IDEA!

362
00:36:23,215 --> 00:36:25,484
TAKE THE SHIP DOWN
TO THE ICE, CAPTAIN.

363
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:29,988
- I'LL GET EVERYTHING READY.
- NO, NO. YOU CANNOT LEAVE
THE SHIP.

364
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:33,859
PROFESSOR! YOU KNOW
THE DANGERS THAT LIE BELOW.

365
00:36:33,892 --> 00:36:38,063
EVEN IF YOU SURVIVE THE COLD,
THERE ARE STILL THE CLIFFS.
YOU COULD NOT CLIMB THE CLIFFS.

366
00:36:38,096 --> 00:36:40,399
WE MUST TRY,
CAPTAIN.

367
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:46,838
I KNOW.
IT'S A GAMBLE, CAPTAIN.

368
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:50,376
BUT WITH MY SON'S LIFE AT STAKE,
I HAVE NO CHOICE.

369
00:36:55,881 --> 00:36:59,117
NO, SIR ANTHONY.
IT IS I WHO HAVE NO CHOICE.

370
00:37:00,886 --> 00:37:02,954
I'M NOT A MAN OF STONE.

371
00:37:05,424 --> 00:37:09,728
THERE ARE TIMES
WHEN THE HEART
MUST RULE THE HEAD.

372
00:37:09,761 --> 00:37:12,431
WE WILL ATTACK THE CLOUD.

373
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:28,507
CAN WE GO
ABOVE THEM?
IMPOSSIBLE!

374
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:32,411
OUR LOAD IS TOO HEAVY.
I'LL SOON LIGHTEN IT.

375
00:39:03,241 --> 00:39:06,344
HURRY UP!
WE ARE LOSING HEIGHT!

376
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:15,781
YOU ALL RIGHT?
YES, QUITE.

377
00:40:15,814 --> 00:40:19,451
I CAN'T HELP THINKING
OF THE CAPTAIN, THOUGH.
POOR FELLA.

378
00:40:19,485 --> 00:40:22,588
HOW LONG MUST WE
KEEP THIS UP FOR?

379
00:40:22,621 --> 00:40:24,222
WE CAN'T SURVIVE
IN THE OPEN. WE'VE
GOT TO KEEP MOVING...

380
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:26,558
'TIL WE FIND SHELTER.

381
00:40:26,592 --> 00:40:29,495

383
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:35,467
IS THIS ANYTHING LIKE
THE PLACE THAT YOU
AND DONALD CAME TO?

384
00:40:37,836 --> 00:40:39,771
I TELL YOU, DONALD FATHER.

385
00:40:40,839 --> 00:40:43,475
WE SEE NOTHING
IN BLIZZARD.

386
00:40:43,509 --> 00:40:47,813
THEN SPIRITS COME, AND...
AND YOU FOUGHT
LIKE A BEAR.

387
00:40:47,846 --> 00:40:50,682
YES, YOU MENTIONED THAT.

388
00:40:59,024 --> 00:41:01,627

389
00:41:03,662 --> 00:41:07,633
I DON'T SEE.
I FEEL.

391
00:41:17,042 --> 00:41:18,343
SOMETHING MOVED!

392
00:41:25,016 --> 00:41:27,686
DID YOU SEE ANYTHING?
I DON'T THINK SO.

393
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:29,788
NEITHER DID I.

394
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:32,624
ALL THE SAME,
I THINK WE SHOULD HEAD
IN THAT DIRECTION.

395
00:41:32,658 --> 00:41:35,493
OH, VERY WELL.
IF YOU DON'T KNOW
WHERE YOU'RE GOING,

396
00:41:35,527 --> 00:41:39,264
I SUPPOSE ONE WAY
IS AS GOOD AS ANOTHER.

397
00:42:12,798 --> 00:42:15,934

THE ISLAND MUST BE

IT'S PROBABLY THERMAL

PARTS OF ICELAND.

403
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:33,919
THERE ARE BUILDINGS
DOWN THERE.

404
00:42:33,952 --> 00:42:37,723
LOOKS LIKE
SOME SORT OF SETTLEMENT.
- THERE ARE PEOPLE THERE.

405
00:42:37,756 --> 00:42:40,859
THAT MEANS THAT DONALD
COULD BE THERE.

THESE PEOPLE
HAVE BEEN HERE

00:46:31,222 --> 00:46:34,492
THEY'RE DESCENDANTS

VIKING EXPEDITION.

00:46:34,525 --> 00:46:38,663
WE'VE ACTUALLY DISCOVERED
A LOST COLONY.
THAT'S QUITE REMARKABLE.

452
00:46:38,696 --> 00:46:40,932
THEY'VE BEEN SO
ISOLATED UP HERE...

453
00:46:40,966 --> 00:46:43,101
THAT THEY'VE COME
TO BELIEVE THAT ALL
THE REST OF THE WORLD...

454
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:47,505
IS A FROZEN WILDERNESS
OF ICE AND SNOW.
HOW VERY ODD.

AH. TAKK.
TAKK.

00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:54,379
YOU MEAN NONE OF THEM
HAVE EVER LEFT THE ISLAND?
THEY HAVE NO REASON TO.

457
00:46:54,412 --> 00:46:56,848
THEY CALL THIS ISLAND
ASTRAGARD...

458
00:46:56,882 --> 00:46:58,850
AND BELIEVE IT TO BE
THE GARDEN OF THE GODS...

459
00:46:58,884 --> 00:47:01,519
AND PERFECT AND UNIQUE
IN A DESOLATE WORLD...

460
00:47:01,552 --> 00:47:04,289
AND SET ASIDE
FOR THEM ALONE,

461
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:07,225
WHY DO THEY FEAR INVADERS?
BECAUSE THEY HAVE
A PROPHECY.

THERE'LL BE A DAY WHEN
THE BARBARIANS FROM
THE ICE AND SNOW...

THEIR PARADISE.

TO DESTROY THEM.

TELL THEM, IVARSSON.

474
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:13,925
I'LL GO WITH THEM, BUT
NOT UNTIL I'VE SEEN MY SON.

VERY HAPPY TO SEE US.

00:49:23,995 --> 00:49:25,696
ASK HIM
ABOUT DONALD.

484
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:27,999
IS IT TRUE THAT YOU
ARE DONALD'S FATHER?

485
00:49:28,033 --> 00:49:31,336
GOOD HEAVENS.
YOU SPEAK ENGLISH.
DONALD TAUGHT ME.

486
00:49:31,369 --> 00:49:36,441
HE LIVES WITH US SINCE
HE CAME TO OUR LAND.
THIS IS MY FATHER.

487
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:41,179
I'M GRATEFUL TO YOU, SIR,
FOR LOOKING AFTER MY SON.
UH, WHERE IS HE NOW?

488
00:49:47,352 --> 00:49:50,855
HE WANTS US
TO GO INTO THE HOUSE.
WE CANNOT TALK OUT HERE.

489
00:49:50,888 --> 00:49:53,558
OH, VERY WELL.
THANK YOU.

490
00:49:57,162 --> 00:50:01,699
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
THEY TOOK DONALD AWAY?
WHO TOOK HIM?

491
00:50:01,732 --> 00:50:04,702
THE GODI'S MEN.
THEY CAME WITH WEAPONS.

492
00:50:04,735 --> 00:50:07,338
THE GODI'S
THEIR HIGH PRIEST.

493
00:50:09,407 --> 00:50:10,975
IT WAS BECAUSE OF THE HUNTER.

494
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:14,212
HE RODE DOWN FROM THE MOUNTAIN
SHOUTING OF INVADERS.

495
00:50:14,245 --> 00:50:16,647
IT WAS THAT FELLOW
ON THE HORSE.
YES.

496
00:50:16,681 --> 00:50:20,651
WHEN THE GODI HEARD,
HE SOUNDED THE LONG HORN.
THE LONG HORN...

497
00:50:20,685 --> 00:50:22,553
IS THEIR CALL TO BATTLE.

498
00:50:22,587 --> 00:50:26,357
BATTLE
WHAT HAS THIS TO DO
WITH DONALD?

499
00:50:26,391 --> 00:50:30,161
WHEN IT WAS TOLD THAT
ONE OF THE INVADERS
WAS DONALD'S FATHER,

500
00:50:30,195 --> 00:50:32,563
THE GODI SAID THAT
DONALD WAS A SPY...

501
00:50:32,597 --> 00:50:34,699
WHO CAME HERE TO
BETRAY US TO THE ENEMY.

502
00:50:34,732 --> 00:50:37,402
WELL, SURELY YOU
DON'T BELIEVE THAT.

503
00:50:37,435 --> 00:50:41,706
WE DON'T... BECAUSE
WE KNOW DONALD.

504
00:50:41,739 --> 00:50:44,542
THERE WERE MANY
THAT DID BELIEVE...

505
00:50:44,575 --> 00:50:46,944
BECAUSE THERE WAS
AN OMEN IN THE SKY.

506
00:50:46,977 --> 00:50:49,180
OMEN?

507
00:50:49,214 --> 00:50:52,117
A MONSTER LIKE A WHALE,
BUT BIGGER MANY TIMES.

508
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:54,252
OH, MY DEAR GIRL,
THAT'S EASILY EXPLAINED.

509
00:50:54,285 --> 00:50:58,589
WHAT THE PEOPLE SAW
WAS MY AIRSHIP.
YOU SEE, IT'S LIKE...

510
00:50:58,623 --> 00:51:00,458
IT... IT...

511
00:51:00,491 --> 00:51:04,429
IT'S LIKE ONE
OF YOUR BOATS, ONLY
IT SAILS IN THE AIR.

512
00:51:04,462 --> 00:51:08,799
NOW, LOOK, IF I COULD
JUST TALK TO THIS GODI,
I COULD EXPLAIN EVERYTHING.

513
00:51:35,993 --> 00:51:38,163
WE'RE TO BE TAKEN
BEFORE THE COUNCIL
AT THE TEMPLE.

514
00:51:38,196 --> 00:51:40,865
ERIK'S A MEMBER.
YOU'LL GET YOUR CHANCE
TO BE HEARD.

515
00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:56,080
THAT GIRL. SHE SPEAKS
BETTER ENGLISH THAN OOMIAK.

516
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:59,116
SHE'S PRETTIER TOO.
IF SHE LEARNED IT ALL
FROM DONALD,

517
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:02,653
HE MUST HAVE SPENT
QUITE A LOT OF TIME
IN HER COMPANY.

518
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:06,857
CAN YOU BLAME HIM?
I CAN'T SAY
I DO, NO.

519
00:52:17,735 --> 00:52:20,638
THIS IS LIKE
AN ARCHAEOLOGIST'S DREAM.

520
00:52:20,671 --> 00:52:24,209
TO GO BACK IN HISTORY
AND WALK THE EARTH
AS IT WAS...

521
00:52:24,242 --> 00:52:27,278
TEN CENTURIES AGO.
I SUGGEST
YOU FORGET THE PAST...

522
00:52:27,312 --> 00:52:29,347
AND START THINKING
ABOUT THE FUTURE,

523
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:33,884
WHICH, FROM THE LOOK OF THINGS,
I'D SAY IS NOT VERY PROMISING.

524
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,509
THE CLOTHES THEY WEAR,
THE WEAPONS THEY CARRY.

525
00:52:58,543 --> 00:53:01,879
EACH ONE OF THEM
COULD BE A MUSEUM PIECE.
THAT'S WHAT I DON'T LIKE.

526
00:53:01,912 --> 00:53:04,081
THOSE MUSEUM PIECES.

527
00:53:11,356 --> 00:53:12,990
LOOK AT THAT!

528
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:17,895
A VIKING LONG SHIP,
EXACTLY THE WAY THEY WERE
BUILT A THOUSAND YEARS AGO.

529
00:53:20,365 --> 00:53:23,768
HERE, NONE OF THAT.
NOW STOP IT.

530
00:53:28,373 --> 00:53:30,241
POOR FELLA.

531
00:53:31,409 --> 00:53:34,245
AND IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

532
00:53:34,279 --> 00:53:36,414
KOMM HER.

533
00:54:51,389 --> 00:54:54,291
THE TEMPLE. THAT'S WHERE
WE'RE GONNA MEET THE COUNCIL.

534
00:54:57,294 --> 00:55:01,198
AH, GOOD. GO STRAIGHT
TO THE TOP, I ALWAYS SAY.

535
00:55:34,432 --> 00:55:38,369
ODIN, THOR AND FREY...

536
00:55:38,403 --> 00:55:40,838
THE GREATEST
OF ALL THE VIKING GODS.

537
00:55:40,871 --> 00:55:43,207
I HOPE THEY'RE
ON OUR SIDE.

538
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:46,444
WE MAY NEED
ALL THE HELP
WE CAN GET.

539
00:55:52,583 --> 00:55:56,153
A VIKING COUNCIL,
STRAIGHT OUT
OF A HISTORY BOOK.

540
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:57,354
THAT'S THE GIRL'S FATHER.

541
00:55:57,388 --> 00:56:00,090
HE SEEMS A SENSIBLE
OLD FELLOW.

542
00:56:01,426 --> 00:56:04,061
THEY PROBABLY STILL CALL
THE ONE WITH THE STAFF...

543
00:56:04,094 --> 00:56:06,363
THE LAWSPEAKER.

544
00:56:11,235 --> 00:56:13,904
THEY ALL LOOK
REASONABLE ENOUGH.

545
00:56:13,938 --> 00:56:16,340
THEY MIGHT BE
MY BOARD OF DIRECTORS...

546
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:19,710
IF IT WEREN'T FOR
THEIR OUTLANDISH COSTUMES.

547
00:56:23,981 --> 00:56:26,584
HE SAID, "BRING OUT
THE OTHER PRISONER."

548
00:56:31,288 --> 00:56:33,958
- DONALD!
- FATHER!

549
00:56:33,991 --> 00:56:36,961
THAT'S MY SON!

550
00:56:50,307 --> 00:56:52,577
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU.

551
00:56:52,610 --> 00:56:54,311
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT.

552
00:56:54,344 --> 00:56:58,649
HE'S MY SON.
JOHN IVARSSON.
DONALD.

553
00:56:58,683 --> 00:57:01,452
HOW DO YOU DO?
HE'S, UH,
KEEN ON THE PAST.

554
00:57:01,486 --> 00:57:03,788
ARCHAEOLOGY.
OH.

555
00:57:03,821 --> 00:57:08,058
SORRY ABOUT ALL THIS.
IT'S A BIT STICKY, I'M AFRAID.

556
00:57:11,195 --> 00:57:14,298
DONALD ROSS...

557
00:57:17,134 --> 00:57:19,303
HE SAYS THAT WHEN
I CAME TO THIS LAND,

558
00:57:19,336 --> 00:57:23,574
I GAVE MY OATH
THAT I CAME ALONE
AND IN PEACE.

559
00:57:27,878 --> 00:57:31,582
BUT NOW COME OTHERS,
AND WITH THEM, AN EVIL
OMEN IN THE SKY...

560
00:57:31,616 --> 00:57:35,152
THAT CANNOT BE
IGNORED.
THAT'S MY CONFOUNDED AIRSHIP.

561
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:42,793
LET THE PRISONERS SPEAK
BEFORE THEY'RE JUDGED.

562
00:57:42,827 --> 00:57:45,630
THAT IS PRECISELY
WHAT I WANTED TO DO.
FATHER...

563
00:57:45,663 --> 00:57:49,266
I'LL HANDLE THIS.
YOU JUST TRANSLATE FOR ME.

564
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:51,836
WHAT DO THEY CALL
THIS ISLAND?
ASTRAGARD.

565
00:57:51,869 --> 00:57:54,338
BUT, FATHER, IT'S...
TSK, TSK, TSK.

566
00:57:54,371 --> 00:57:57,007
HONORED COUNCIL OF ASTRAGARD,

567
00:58:01,078 --> 00:58:05,516
I COME TO YOUR BEAUTIFUL
COUNTRY AS A FRIEND,

568
00:58:09,086 --> 00:58:11,388
IN PEACE, [ Speaking Norse ]

569
00:58:11,421 --> 00:58:16,126
SEEKING ONLY MY SON,
WHO WAS LOST TO ME.

570
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:19,163
[ Donald Speaking Norse ]

571
00:58:19,196 --> 00:58:23,067
- THE GODI.

572
00:59:02,607 --> 00:59:05,275
HE'S TELLING THEM
NOT TO LISTEN
TO OUR LIES.

573
00:59:07,945 --> 00:59:11,215
IT'S OBVIOUS THAT WE'RE
BARBARIANS WHO COVET
THEIR SACRED LANDS.

574
00:59:18,956 --> 00:59:23,027
AND WE MUST
BE CONDEMNED AT ONCE,
AND WITHOUT A HEARING.

575
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:25,329
NOW, LOOK HERE,
I THOUGHT I EXPLAINED...

576
00:59:33,137 --> 00:59:37,742
IT IS NO LONGER A MATTER
FOR THE COUNCIL,
FOR THE GODS HAVE SPOKEN.

577
00:59:39,343 --> 00:59:42,212
IF THESE MEN ARE SPARED,
MORE WILL COME...

578
00:59:42,246 --> 00:59:44,481
IN ARMED HORDES...

579
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:49,820
TO PILLAGE AND PROFANE
OUR SACRED LAND.

580
00:59:56,093 --> 00:59:59,897
DODEN! DODEN! DODEN!

581
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:04,334
THERE CAN BE BUT ONE PENALTY
FOR THE INVADERS: DEATH.

582
01:00:04,368 --> 01:00:06,937
DODEN! DODEN! DODEN!

583
01:00:40,871 --> 01:00:43,107
DODEN.

584
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:48,112
DODEN! DODEN!
DODEN! DODEN!

585
01:00:48,145 --> 01:00:50,681
QUITE A SEND-OFF.

586
01:00:50,715 --> 01:00:53,483
FULL VIKING HONORS.

587
01:00:55,185 --> 01:00:57,487
ALL VERY AUTHENTIC.

588
01:00:58,388 --> 01:01:00,557
VERY FINAL.

589
01:01:03,393 --> 01:01:05,529
I'M SORRY, FATHER.

590
01:01:06,396 --> 01:01:09,700
- NONSENSE, MY BOY.
- DONALD!

591
01:01:10,768 --> 01:01:13,270
FREYJA!

592
01:01:55,112 --> 01:01:57,547
WE'RE IN YOUR DEBT,
YOUNG LADY.

593
01:02:11,962 --> 01:02:13,964
HERE THEY COME!

594
01:02:39,824 --> 01:02:41,926
AND PULL!

595
01:02:58,708 --> 01:03:02,012
THE SHORE!
IT'S OUR ONLY CHANCE!

596
01:03:51,896 --> 01:03:55,399
YOU STAY HERE.
I WILL DRAW THEM AWAY.
NO, YOU WON'T!

597
01:03:55,432 --> 01:03:57,667
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.
HE'S RIGHT, MY DEAR.

598
01:03:57,701 --> 01:03:59,904
IT'S YOU THEY'RE AFTER,
NOT ME.

599
01:03:59,937 --> 01:04:02,672
THERE IS A HUNTERS'
CAVE UP THERE...

600
01:04:02,706 --> 01:04:04,741
WITH FOOD AND CLOTHING.

601
01:04:04,774 --> 01:04:07,444
I'LL BE BACK
WHEN IT'S SAFE.
FREYJA!

602
01:04:17,387 --> 01:04:19,456
HERE THEY COME.

603
01:04:39,543 --> 01:04:41,946
I THINK SHE'S DONE IT.

604
01:04:41,979 --> 01:04:43,880
GOOD GIRL.
I SHOULD NEVER
HAVE LET HER GO.

605
01:04:43,914 --> 01:04:46,450
IF THEY CATCH HER...
OH, DON'T WORRY, MY BOY.

606
01:04:46,483 --> 01:04:48,452
SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE'S DOING.

607
01:04:48,485 --> 01:04:50,554
LET'S FIND THAT CAVE.

608
01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:04,601
HELLO.

609
01:05:04,634 --> 01:05:07,938
OOMIAK,
MY DEAR OLD FRIEND!

610
01:05:07,972 --> 01:05:10,774
I'M SO GLAD TO SEE YOU!
WE ALL ARE.

611
01:05:10,807 --> 01:05:12,943
- WE THOUGHT WE'D LOST YA.
- CAN'T KILL OOMIAK.

612
01:05:12,977 --> 01:05:15,412
I HIDE IN WATER,
SWIM FAR LIKE WHITE BEAR.

613
01:05:15,445 --> 01:05:17,647
GOOD! GOOD!
BUT LET'S GO.

614
01:05:28,592 --> 01:05:30,894
I WATCH NOW.
THERE'S STILL NOTHING.

615
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:34,131
OH, IVARSSON'S UP ABOVE
SCOUTING AROUND, RIGHT?

616
01:05:38,335 --> 01:05:40,470
GOOD MORNING, FATHER.
HMM?

617
01:05:40,504 --> 01:05:42,639
GOOD MORNING.

618
01:05:42,672 --> 01:05:44,274
DID YOU SLEEP WELL?

619
01:05:44,308 --> 01:05:47,311
WRETCHEDLY. YOU MUST BE
A BIT DONE-IN YOURSELF.

620
01:05:47,344 --> 01:05:49,279
OH, I'M WORRIED ABOUT FREYJA.

621
01:05:49,313 --> 01:05:53,517
SO AM I, MY BOY.
SO AM I.

622
01:05:53,550 --> 01:05:56,987
WELL, I'VE MADE
A MESS OF IT,
HAVEN'T I?

623
01:05:57,021 --> 01:06:00,790
OF WHAT, FATHER?
THE WHOLE MISERABLE THING.

624
01:06:00,824 --> 01:06:04,228
ALL THIS NIGHTMARE
WE'RE LIVING IN, IT...

625
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:08,665
IT'S ALL MY FAULT.
EVERY BIT OF IT.

626
01:06:08,698 --> 01:06:11,168
YOUR FAULT

627
01:06:11,201 --> 01:06:14,671
IF ANYONE'S TO BLAME,
I'M THE ONE THAT RAN OFF
CHASING RAINBOWS.

628
01:06:14,704 --> 01:06:16,806
AND YOU'RE NOT
RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT.

629
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:19,643
I AM. RIGHT FROM
THE BEGINNING.

630
01:06:19,676 --> 01:06:23,147
I WAS ALWAYS
TRYING TO SHAPE YOU...

631
01:06:23,180 --> 01:06:25,449
INTO MY MOLD.

632
01:06:25,482 --> 01:06:28,485
BULLYING, BADGERING,
NEVER LETTING UP.

633
01:06:28,518 --> 01:06:31,955
IF I HADN'T DRIVEN YOU
AWAY FROM HOME, NONE OF THIS
WOULD HAVE HAPPENED.

634
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:35,059
FATHER, YOU DIDN'T DRIVE ME.
DONALD,

635
01:06:35,092 --> 01:06:39,396
I RODE AN AIRSHIP
ACROSS THE TOP OF THE WORLD
TO TELL YOU THIS.

636
01:06:39,429 --> 01:06:41,998
IF WE GET OUT OF THIS,

637
01:06:42,032 --> 01:06:44,868
YOU CAN DO ANYTHING
YOU WANT TO DO.

638
01:06:44,901 --> 01:06:47,704
YOU'LL BE FREE OF ME,
I PROMISE YOU.

639
01:06:47,737 --> 01:06:50,807
BUT I DON'T WANT
TO BE FREE OF YOU.
I NEVER DID.

640
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:55,412
I CAME HERE
LOOKING FOR ADVENTURE,

641
01:06:55,445 --> 01:06:57,514
AND I CERTAINLY FOUND THAT.

642
01:06:57,547 --> 01:07:00,150
BUT... I DON'T BELONG HERE.

643
01:07:00,184 --> 01:07:04,521
NOW, WHEN WE GET
OUT OF THIS...
AND WE WILL...

644
01:07:04,554 --> 01:07:07,191
THEN I'M COMING HOME WITH YOU.

645
01:07:07,224 --> 01:07:11,228
I WANT TO SHARE IN YOUR WORK
AND YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES...

646
01:07:11,261 --> 01:07:13,297
IF YOU'LL LET ME.

647
01:07:15,099 --> 01:07:17,201
IF I'LL LET YOU?

648
01:07:17,234 --> 01:07:19,303
WH...

649
01:07:20,770 --> 01:07:23,173
YOU WON'T REGRET IT.

650
01:07:23,207 --> 01:07:25,309
I'LL SEE TO THAT.

651
01:07:29,146 --> 01:07:32,616
DONALD?
FREYJA!

652
01:07:34,218 --> 01:07:37,754
- HE WAS QUITE WORRIED
ABOUT YOU, MY DEAR.

653
01:07:37,787 --> 01:07:39,623
I WENT BACK
TO THE FARM.

654
01:07:39,656 --> 01:07:43,460
IT WILL BE JUST AS WE HAD
ARRANGED IT. FATHER WILL
GIVE US DOGS AND A SLED.

655
01:07:43,493 --> 01:07:46,096
WHAT HAD YOU ARRANGED?
YOU SEE,
FOR SOME TIME NOW,

656
01:07:46,130 --> 01:07:48,432
FREYJA AND I
HAVE BEEN PLANNING
TO LEAVE THE ISLAND.

657
01:07:48,465 --> 01:07:50,934
IF WE MANAGED TO ESCAPE,
WE HOPED TO REACH
FORT CONGER.

658
01:07:50,967 --> 01:07:52,936
THE TWO OF YOU TOGETHER?

659
01:07:52,969 --> 01:07:55,805
DO YOU THINK
I'D LEAVE HER BEHIND?

660
01:07:58,242 --> 01:07:59,909
NOT IF YOU'RE
YOUR FATHER'S SON, NO.

661
01:07:59,943 --> 01:08:03,247
HELLO! BOATS!
THEY COME!

662
01:08:13,657 --> 01:08:15,625
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

663
01:08:15,659 --> 01:08:17,827
THERE'S NOT MUCH COVER,

664
01:08:17,861 --> 01:08:20,664
BUT I THINK WE CAN
GET TO THE TOP
WITHOUT BEING SEEN.

665
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:25,369
THAT SETTLES IT.

666
01:08:28,372 --> 01:08:31,007
WE CAN'T STAY HERE.
THOSE HOUNDS WOULD
FIND US IN NO TIME.

667
01:08:32,709 --> 01:08:35,812
LOOK. THE GODI'S
JOINED US.

668
01:08:38,348 --> 01:08:42,686
BLOODTHIRSTY BOUNDER.
COME ON, EVERYBODY.
UP WE GO.

669
01:09:30,567 --> 01:09:32,769
THEY GO! THEY GO!

670
01:09:35,071 --> 01:09:37,374
WE'VE DONE IT!
THEY'VE FINALLY GIVEN UP!

671
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:40,176
- THANK HEAVENS FOR THAT.
- LOOK OUT, FATHER!

672
01:09:54,591 --> 01:09:57,727
CLUMSY OF ME.
NOW THE WOLVES
ARE AFTER US AGAIN.

673
01:09:57,761 --> 01:09:59,796
I'M AFRAID SO,
FATHER.

674
01:10:15,545 --> 01:10:19,349
IT'S INCREDIBLE!
IT'S ABSOLUTELY
INCREDIBLE!

675
01:10:19,383 --> 01:10:22,252
NASTY SORT OF PLACE.
- OOMIAK, GO WATCH BELOW.

676
01:10:22,286 --> 01:10:24,421
WE'RE GOING TO NEED
SOMEWHERE TO HIDE.
BUT WHERE?

677
01:10:24,454 --> 01:10:27,524
THEY MUST KNOW
EVERY FOOT OF THIS ISLAND.
THE BAY OF WHALES!

678
01:10:27,557 --> 01:10:30,427
DONALD!
IT'S SOMEWHERE
OVER THERE,
TO THE SOUTH.

679
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:33,797
IT'S SACRED. TABOO.
THE VIKINGS WON'T
GO NEAR IT.

680
01:10:33,830 --> 01:10:35,865
THAT'S IT, THEN.
LET'S GO!

681
01:10:35,899 --> 01:10:38,768
NO, DONALD, PLEASE!
THE SPIRITS!

682
01:10:38,802 --> 01:10:40,770
FREYJA, BELIEVE ME...
WHAT IS IT?

683
01:10:40,804 --> 01:10:42,772
THE SPIRITS
ARE GOOD SPIRITS.

684
01:10:42,806 --> 01:10:46,476
DIDN'T THEY PROTECT
YOUR PEOPLE WHEN
THEY FIRST CAME HERE?

685
01:10:46,510 --> 01:10:49,245
SURELY THEY'LL
PROTECT US.

686
01:10:49,279 --> 01:10:50,914
THEY COME!
THEY COME! WE GO!

687
01:10:50,947 --> 01:10:53,450
FREYJA, TRUST ME.

688
01:10:57,621 --> 01:10:59,489
COME ON UP!

689
01:11:13,136 --> 01:11:17,173
ODDLY ENOUGH,
THEY SAY THIS SULFUR'S
GOOD FOR THE LUNGS.

690
01:11:17,206 --> 01:11:19,175
AHH.

691
01:12:14,898 --> 01:12:18,234
SIR ANTHONY, THIS IS
HARDLY THE TIME TO REST.

692
01:12:21,738 --> 01:12:26,075
I ONLY HOPE WE SOON FIND
THAT BLASTED BAY OF WHALES.

693
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:45,629
COME ON!

694
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:33,643
MY FATHER!

695
01:13:40,450 --> 01:13:42,686
FATHER!

696
01:14:02,639 --> 01:14:05,775
BURNING ONE MINUTE,
FREEZING THE NEXT.

697
01:14:05,809 --> 01:14:07,811
A MAN COULD
CATCH HIS DEATH.

698
01:14:07,844 --> 01:14:09,946
WELL, THAT'S
WHAT'S SO INTERESTING
ABOUT THE ARCTIC:

699
01:14:09,979 --> 01:14:12,081
ITS, UH,
CONTRADICTIONS.

700
01:14:12,115 --> 01:14:14,684
YOU KNOW, ON MY FIRST
EXPEDITION TO BAFFIN LAND...

701
01:14:14,718 --> 01:14:16,052
IVARSSON, PLEASE. STOP!

702
01:14:17,787 --> 01:14:20,824
WHAT WE NEED
IS A CONFERENCE.

703
01:14:20,857 --> 01:14:24,160
CONFERENCE?
ABOUT WHAT, FATHER?

704
01:14:24,193 --> 01:14:26,329
WELL, IF WE FIND
THE BAY OF WHALES,

705
01:14:26,362 --> 01:14:28,665
AND IF IT'S TRUE
THAT THE GODI
WON'T FOLLOW US THERE,

706
01:14:28,698 --> 01:14:31,835
WHAT DO WE DO THEN?

707
01:14:31,868 --> 01:14:35,705
WE LIE LOW FOR A BIT,
TRY AND MAKE OUR WAY ACROSS
THE MOUNTAINS TO FREYJA'S FARM.

708
01:14:35,739 --> 01:14:38,307
WE CAN'T GO BACK
THROUGH THAT INFERNO.
NO, NO, NO, NO.

709
01:14:38,341 --> 01:14:43,446
WE FIND ICE BOAT, FLOAT.
FFFF, VERY GOOD.
BOAT?

710
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:45,849
WHAT ON EARTH'S
HE TALKING ABOUT?
I THINK HE WANTS TO FIND...

711
01:14:45,882 --> 01:14:49,018
A PIECE OF PACK ICE
DOWN THERE AND FLOAT
AROUND THE MOUNTAIN.

712
01:14:49,052 --> 01:14:51,154
PREPOSTEROUS.

713
01:15:02,098 --> 01:15:04,868
WHERE THE WHALES
GO TO DIE.

714
01:15:04,901 --> 01:15:09,606
ALL THOSE GREAT CREATURES
FROM EVERY SEA LYING THERE
FROM THE BEGINNING OF TIME.

715
01:15:10,907 --> 01:15:13,376
JUST LOOK AT
ALL THAT WHALEBONE!

716
01:15:13,409 --> 01:15:15,511
WORTH MILLIONS OF POUNDS!

717
01:15:15,545 --> 01:15:19,448
AND HEAVEN KNOWS WHAT PRICE
THE AMBERGRIS WOULD FETCH!

718
01:15:22,118 --> 01:15:23,286
ALL THAT DOESN'T MATTER NOW,
DOES IT, FATHER?

719
01:15:26,222 --> 01:15:29,092
FREYJA. DON'T BE AFRAID.

720
01:15:29,125 --> 01:15:31,194
THINK OF THE SAGA.

721
01:15:31,227 --> 01:15:33,730
DOESN'T IT TELL HOW,
LONG AGO, IT WAS THE WHALES...

722
01:15:33,763 --> 01:15:37,667
THAT LED YOUR PEOPLE HERE,
WHERE THEY FOUND PEACE
AND HAPPINESS?

723
01:15:37,701 --> 01:15:41,638
SO THERE'S NOTHING
TO FEAR, BELIEVE ME.

724
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:46,075
WE NEED ICE BOAT.
HOW WE GET DOWN THERE?

725
01:15:46,109 --> 01:15:48,745
YES, HOW? NOT DOWN
THESE CLIFFS, OBVIOUSLY.

726
01:15:48,778 --> 01:15:51,080
THERE MUST BE A WAY.
THE VIKINGS FOUND ONE.

727
01:15:51,114 --> 01:15:54,417
FREYJA, IS IT IN THE SAGA?
DOES IT TELL HOW THEY CAME
UP FROM THE SEA?

728
01:15:54,450 --> 01:15:56,419
WITH THE HELP
OF THE GODS.

729
01:15:56,452 --> 01:16:00,389
IT IS TOLD
THAT THEY CAME THROUGH
THE... MOUTH OF HELL.

730
01:16:00,423 --> 01:16:02,692
THAT'S NOT VERY EXPLICIT,
I'M AFRAID.

731
01:16:02,726 --> 01:16:06,696
WAIT A MINUTE.
THAT VOLCANO IN ICELAND,
MOUNT HEKLA.

732
01:16:06,730 --> 01:16:09,766
THE EARLY CHRISTIANS
BELIEVED THAT WAS
THE ENTRANCE TO HELL.

733
01:16:09,799 --> 01:16:14,037
- ENTRANCE.
IT'S A WILD THOUGHT.

734
01:16:14,070 --> 01:16:16,606
COME ON!

735
01:16:20,476 --> 01:16:23,813
THE CRATER OF
A DEAD VOLCANO!
QUIET!

736
01:16:26,750 --> 01:16:29,252
YOU HEAR THAT?
DOWN THERE SOMEWHERE
THERE'S AN UNDERGROUND RIVER.

737
01:16:29,285 --> 01:16:31,154
THE RIVER MUST
FLOW DOWN TO THE SEA,

738
01:16:31,187 --> 01:16:34,223
WHICH MEANS THERE HAS TO BE
A PASSAGE FROM THE BOTTOM
OF THE CRATER TO THE BAY!

739
01:16:34,257 --> 01:16:36,826
HELLO!

740
01:16:40,997 --> 01:16:43,266
COME ON!

741
01:18:31,307 --> 01:18:34,243
LOOK! THE WATER'S
RUNNING OUT! COME ON!

742
01:18:34,277 --> 01:18:37,580
WHERE TO?
WHEREVER THE WATER WENT.

743
01:18:46,089 --> 01:18:48,291
LOOK!

744
01:19:37,673 --> 01:19:42,478
DO NOT WORRY.
I HUNT SEAL THIS WAY
MANY TIMES.

745
01:19:42,511 --> 01:19:45,849
IT'S NOT THIS
I'M WORRIED ABOUT.
IT'S THEM.

746
01:19:47,383 --> 01:19:50,453
WILL THEY NEVER GIVE UP?

747
01:19:50,486 --> 01:19:53,256
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY
THE BOWMEN HAVEN'T
BEEN SHOOTING AT US.

748
01:19:53,289 --> 01:19:55,859
THEY DO NOT
HAVE TO.

749
01:19:55,892 --> 01:19:58,661
THEY ONLY WAIT
TO SEE US DIE.
FREYJA!

750
01:19:58,694 --> 01:20:04,133
IT'S TOLD IN THE SAGAS
THAT THE BAY IS GUARDED
BY SEA BEASTS.

751
01:20:04,167 --> 01:20:06,035
WE CANNOT ESCAPE.

752
01:20:31,027 --> 01:20:33,963
KILLER WHALES!

753
01:20:33,997 --> 01:20:35,999
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?
ANYTHING WE CAN!

754
01:20:41,037 --> 01:20:43,873
HERE COMES THE OTHER ONE!

755
01:20:57,620 --> 01:21:00,456
HOLD ON, EVERYBODY!

756
01:21:31,287 --> 01:21:34,723
- HELLO, HELLO!

757
01:21:37,660 --> 01:21:39,628
THE HYPERION!

758
01:21:39,662 --> 01:21:43,799
AND HEAVEN BE PRAISED,
OUR OLD FRIEND
THE CAPTAIN!

759
01:21:45,234 --> 01:21:47,236
MY COMPLIMENTS,
CAPTAIN.

760
01:21:47,270 --> 01:21:48,938
YOU KEEP AN
EXCELLENT TABLE.

761
01:21:48,972 --> 01:21:52,041
AND YOU'RE AN EXCELLENT SHOT.
YOU SAVED OUR LIVES.

762
01:21:52,075 --> 01:21:55,044
THANK YOU.
AN UNEXPECTED PLEASURE.

763
01:21:55,078 --> 01:21:59,615
SINCE I LANDED TWO DAYS AGO,
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO SAVE MY OWN.

764
01:21:59,648 --> 01:22:01,784
BUT GETTING
OUT OF HERE...

765
01:22:01,817 --> 01:22:04,420
THAT'S GOING TO BE
QUITE A PROBLEM,
ISN'T IT, CAPTAIN?

766
01:22:04,453 --> 01:22:06,489
I HAVE THE SOLUTION.

767
01:22:08,457 --> 01:22:10,926
MY SHIP MAY BE
BATTERED AND TORN,

768
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:14,897
BUT THE MIND
THAT CONCEIVED IT...
THAT STILL FUNCTIONS.

769
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:17,833
AS YOU SEE, THE SHIP
HAS LOST MUCH GAS,

770
01:22:17,866 --> 01:22:21,504
BUT IT RETAINS
SOME, UH... BUOYANCY?

771
01:22:21,537 --> 01:22:24,440
SO IF WE REDUCE
SUFFICIENTLY THE WEIGHT,

772
01:22:24,473 --> 01:22:26,509
THEN IT WILL RISE.

773
01:22:26,542 --> 01:22:29,278
HOW WOULD YOU
REDUCE THE WEIGHT?

774
01:22:30,613 --> 01:22:32,781
ABANDON THE MOTORS.

775
01:22:34,717 --> 01:22:38,287
THE PROPELLERS
ARE BROKEN ANYWAY.
THE GONDOLA TOO.

776
01:22:38,321 --> 01:22:41,957
STRIP THE SHIP
OF EVERYTHING
THAT WEIGHTS IT DOWN.

777
01:22:41,991 --> 01:22:45,761
WHAT HAVE WE THEN?
A FREE BALLOON.

778
01:22:45,794 --> 01:22:48,197
BY JOVE!
AT LEAST IT WOULD
CARRY US ACROSS THE BAY.

779
01:22:48,231 --> 01:22:52,035
YES, AND IF WE CAN
JUST REACH THE PACK ICE.
WE SHALL GO FARTHER THAN THAT.

780
01:22:52,068 --> 01:22:54,203
THE PREVAILING WIND
IS TO THE SOUTH.

781
01:22:54,237 --> 01:22:57,040
IF IT HOLDS,
WE SHOULD BE ABLE
TO DRIFT TO GREENLAND.

782
01:22:57,073 --> 01:22:59,975
WHEN WE REACH THE COAST,
WE DESCEND...

783
01:23:00,009 --> 01:23:03,946
AND PROCEED ON FOOT
TO THE NEAREST HABITATION.

784
01:23:03,979 --> 01:23:08,317
CAPTAIN BRIEUX, YOU ARE
A VERY REMARKABLE MAN.

785
01:23:08,351 --> 01:23:10,719
I'VE ALWAYS FELT SO.

786
01:23:15,724 --> 01:23:18,394
SIR ANTHONY!

787
01:23:18,427 --> 01:23:20,229
I'D SAY THIS IS
A BIT MUCH, ISN'T IT?

788
01:23:20,263 --> 01:23:22,965
HARDLY THE TIME
FOR CEREMONIES.
LET'S BE OFF.

789
01:23:22,998 --> 01:23:26,135
PLEASE, SIR ANTHONY.
THIS IS A MOMENT TO BE SAVORED.

790
01:23:26,169 --> 01:23:31,040
ONCE MORE WE STAND
ON THE THRESHOLD OF
A GREAT ADVENTURE.

791
01:23:31,074 --> 01:23:33,076
TO MY HYPERION!

792
01:23:35,178 --> 01:23:36,879
MAY SHE RISE...

793
01:23:36,912 --> 01:23:40,015
LIKE A PHOENIX
FROM THE ASHES OF DESPAIR...

794
01:23:40,049 --> 01:23:42,585
AND SOAR
LIKE MAN'S IMAGINATION...

795
01:23:42,618 --> 01:23:47,156
TO GREENLAND AND BEYOND.

796
01:23:47,190 --> 01:23:49,925
THE HYPERION.

797
01:23:55,764 --> 01:23:59,001
NOW LET'S GET GOING,
SHALL WE?

798
01:23:59,034 --> 01:24:01,003
BUT OF COURSE,
MONSIEUR.

799
01:24:01,036 --> 01:24:03,606
I WILL SHOW YOU NOW
THE INGENIOUS ARRANGEMENTS...

800
01:24:03,639 --> 01:24:05,541
I'VE MADE
FOR OUR DEPARTURE.

801
01:24:05,574 --> 01:24:09,945
PERHAPS YOU HAVE OBSERVED THAT
I'VE CUT LOOSE THE GONDOLA,

802
01:24:09,978 --> 01:24:13,082
AND THE SHIP IS NOW
ATTACHED TO IT
ONLY BY A SINGLE CABLE.

803
01:24:13,116 --> 01:24:15,218
SO ARE THE MOTORS
AND THE TAIL.

804
01:24:15,251 --> 01:24:19,588
THIS SECTION, TOO,
LINKED TO THE SHIP
ONLY BY A CABLE.

805
01:24:19,622 --> 01:24:21,690
WHEN I SLIP THESE CABLES,

806
01:24:21,724 --> 01:24:27,029
THE GONDOLA, THE MOTORS,
AND THE TAIL DETACH
THEMSELVES, AND WE RISE.

807
01:24:27,062 --> 01:24:29,298
ARE YOU SURE?

808
01:24:29,332 --> 01:24:31,234
YOU WILL SEE.

809
01:24:32,301 --> 01:24:35,404
NOW, GENTLEMEN,
IF YOU WILL ASSIST ME.

810
01:24:35,438 --> 01:24:37,940
THE GONDOLA.

811
01:24:37,973 --> 01:24:40,209
THE MOTORS AND THE TAIL.

812
01:24:40,243 --> 01:24:43,612
WHEN I SAY "THREE," YOU WILL
PULL WITH ALL YOUR FORCE.

813
01:24:43,646 --> 01:24:45,414
RIGHT.

814
01:24:45,448 --> 01:24:47,950
- PERMISSION TO PROCEED,
MONSIEUR?

815
01:24:47,983 --> 01:24:50,253
OOH, YES, YES, YES.
PROCEED.

816
01:24:50,286 --> 01:24:52,121
VERY WELL.

817
01:24:53,156 --> 01:24:55,291
ONE.

818
01:24:55,324 --> 01:24:57,626
TWO.

819
01:24:57,660 --> 01:24:58,961
THREE!

820
01:25:21,684 --> 01:25:23,919
WELL, SIR ANTHONY?

821
01:25:23,952 --> 01:25:26,189
IT WORKED PERFECTLY.

822
01:25:26,222 --> 01:25:29,292
ONCE AGAIN, CAPTAIN,
I UNDERESTIMATED YOU.

823
01:25:42,705 --> 01:25:46,642
WELL, I THINK I'LL TURN IN.
I HAVEN'T HAD A GOOD NIGHT'S
SLEEP SINCE I LEFT ENGLAND.

824
01:25:46,675 --> 01:25:48,811
SIR ANTHONY?
HMM?

825
01:25:51,180 --> 01:25:53,148
TAKE A LOOK.

826
01:25:56,385 --> 01:25:58,287
CAMPFIRES.

827
01:25:58,321 --> 01:26:00,323
SO THEY'RE STILL
WAITING FOR US.

828
01:26:00,356 --> 01:26:04,827
IT'S A PITY WE'LL
HAVE TO DISAPPOINT THEM.

829
01:26:14,102 --> 01:26:16,138
WHAT IS IT?

830
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:18,274
YOU'RE NOT
FRIGHTENED ANYMORE?

831
01:26:20,075 --> 01:26:23,312
A LITTLE.
OH, NO, YOU MUSTN'T BE.

832
01:26:23,346 --> 01:26:25,514
IT'S ALL OVER.

833
01:26:25,548 --> 01:26:27,550
WE'RE SAFE NOW.

834
01:26:27,583 --> 01:26:31,254
I KNOW. IT IS NOT THAT.

835
01:26:31,287 --> 01:26:34,089
WHAT, THEN?

836
01:26:34,122 --> 01:26:38,927
IT IS THE WORLD
BEYOND OUR MOUNTAINS...
YOUR WORLD.

837
01:26:40,028 --> 01:26:41,930
MY WORLD ISN'T
REALLY SO DIFFERENT.

838
01:26:41,964 --> 01:26:45,067
IT'S BIGGER AND
EVERYTHING MOVES FASTER.

839
01:26:45,100 --> 01:26:48,203
WE LIVE BY CLOCKS
AND MACHINES...

840
01:26:48,237 --> 01:26:50,806
INSTEAD OF TIDES
AND SEASONS.

841
01:26:51,740 --> 01:26:53,942
YOU'LL GET USED TO IT...

842
01:26:54,877 --> 01:26:57,280
AND BE HAPPY,

843
01:26:57,313 --> 01:27:02,285
BECAUSE YOU'LL BE SURROUNDED
BY PEOPLE YOU LOVE
AND WHO LOVE YOU.

844
01:27:03,386 --> 01:27:06,555
I WISH MY FATHER
COULD BE WITH US.

845
01:27:06,589 --> 01:27:08,724
I KNOW.

846
01:27:08,757 --> 01:27:10,926
BUT HIS HOME
IS ASTRAGARD.

847
01:27:10,959 --> 01:27:13,962
HIS HEART
WILL ALWAYS BE HERE.

848
01:27:17,300 --> 01:27:19,335
MINE IS WITH YOU.

849
01:27:54,202 --> 01:27:56,472
IVARSSON!
HM... HMM?

850
01:27:56,505 --> 01:28:00,242
WHEN DOES THE FIRST SHIP
LEAVE GREENLAND
IN THE SPRING?

851
01:28:00,275 --> 01:28:03,011
USUALLY THE BEGINNING
OF APRIL.

852
01:28:03,045 --> 01:28:05,581
SO WITH ANY LUCK,
WE SHOULD BE
BACK IN ENGLAND...

853
01:28:05,614 --> 01:28:07,316
IN ABOUT SIX WEEKS.

854
01:28:07,350 --> 01:28:09,618
I SHOULD NOT
COUNT ON IT,
MONSIEUR.

855
01:28:09,652 --> 01:28:11,420
THE WIND HAS CHANGED.

856
01:28:11,454 --> 01:28:13,522
WE ARE DRIFTING
BACK TO THE LAND.

857
01:28:15,891 --> 01:28:19,294
HANG IT ALL.
CAN'T SOMETHING
BE DONE?

858
01:28:19,328 --> 01:28:21,997
I CANNOT COMMAND
THE WIND, MONSIEUR.

859
01:28:27,803 --> 01:28:31,206
WE'RE RISING.
THE UPDRAFT. THE WIND
AGAINST THE CLIFFS.

860
01:28:31,239 --> 01:28:34,377
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
WE GET TO THE TOP?

861
01:29:33,902 --> 01:29:36,271
EVERYBODY, OUT. QUICK!

862
01:30:30,158 --> 01:30:32,260
IT'S TRUE THAT
THE GODS WERE ANGRY,

863
01:30:32,294 --> 01:30:34,262
BUT IT WAS THE GODI
WHO DID WRONG...

864
01:30:34,296 --> 01:30:37,299
BY LEADING
THE PEOPLE TO HATRED
AND TO VIOLENCE.

865
01:30:37,332 --> 01:30:40,002
I'M GLAD
THEY RECOGNIZE THAT.

866
01:30:44,707 --> 01:30:47,910
THE PRISONERS
MAY GO IN PEACE
ON THIS CONDITION:

867
01:30:47,943 --> 01:30:50,278
THAT THEY SWEAR
A SACRED OATH...

868
01:30:56,384 --> 01:30:59,021
NEVER TO REVEAL
THE EXISTENCE OF THIS,
THE SACRED ISLAND.

869
01:30:59,054 --> 01:31:01,189
THAT'S FAIR ENOUGH.

870
01:31:04,359 --> 01:31:07,763
BU... TO ENSURE THAT
THE OATH BE HONORED
FOR ALL TIME,

871
01:31:07,796 --> 01:31:09,798
WE MUST DEMAND
ONE THING.

872
01:31:18,807 --> 01:31:21,476
WELL, GO ON. WHAT IS IT?

873
01:31:21,510 --> 01:31:23,679
THAT YOU LEAVE
A HOSTAGE HERE.

874
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:27,315
YOUR SON.

875
01:31:32,555 --> 01:31:34,489
I REFUSE TO DISCUSS IT
ANY FURTHER.

876
01:31:34,523 --> 01:31:38,160
HOW COULD THEY
POSSIBLY IMAGINE I WOULD
LEAVE YOU BEHIND?

877
01:31:38,193 --> 01:31:40,729
BUT THOSE ARE THEIR TERMS!
I WILL NOT PERMIT IT.

878
01:31:40,763 --> 01:31:43,532
FATHER, WITHOUT A HOSTAGE,
NONE OF US WILL LEAVE HERE!

879
01:31:43,566 --> 01:31:47,235
BLAST IT!
THEN I'LL BE THE HOSTAGE!
I DON'T THINK SO, SIR ANTHONY.

880
01:31:47,269 --> 01:31:51,206
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
EVERYTHING'S ALREADY
BEEN ARRANGED.

881
01:31:51,239 --> 01:31:54,710
AND VERY SATISFACTORILY
FOR EVERYBODY, I THINK.

882
01:31:56,879 --> 01:32:00,549
ARE YOU SURE
IT'S WHAT YOU WANT?

883
01:32:00,583 --> 01:32:04,720
ARE YOU REALLY SURE
YOU WANT TO BE LEFT BEHIND?
YES, I'M SURE.

884
01:32:04,753 --> 01:32:07,522
THIS IS A CHANCE
NO ARCHAEOLOGIST
COULD TURN DOWN.

885
01:32:07,556 --> 01:32:10,025
NOT ONLY TO STUDY THE PAST,
BUT TO RELIVE IT?

886
01:32:10,058 --> 01:32:14,029
I MEAN, HERE IT ALL IS,
HIDDEN BEHIND THIS MIST
FOR A THOUSAND YEARS,

887
01:32:14,062 --> 01:32:16,198
AND I HAVEN'T EVEN
SCRATCHED THE SURFACE.

888
01:32:16,231 --> 01:32:18,233
BESIDES, WHO SAYS
I'M BEING LEFT BEHIND?

889
01:32:18,266 --> 01:32:20,368
WE ARCHAEOLOGISTS
TAKE A LONGER VIEW.

890
01:32:20,402 --> 01:32:23,038
WHOLE CIVILIZATIONS
HAVE VANISHED BEFORE,
YOU KNOW.

891
01:32:23,071 --> 01:32:27,576
THE DAY MAY COME
WHEN THIS MIGHT BE
MAN'S LAST REFUGE.

892
01:32:29,044 --> 01:32:30,378
GOOD LUCK.

893
01:32:55,838 --> 01:32:57,773
RIGHT, THEN!

894
01:32:57,806 --> 01:33:00,308
GET!

895
01:33:12,487 --> 01:33:15,590
GOOD-BYE,
MY FRIENDS!
