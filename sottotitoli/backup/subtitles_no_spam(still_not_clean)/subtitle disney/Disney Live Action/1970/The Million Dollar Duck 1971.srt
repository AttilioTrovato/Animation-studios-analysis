00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:30,631
[Ringing]

176
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:33,007
Oh, come on.
Get that stupid duck out of here.

177
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:36,138
Wait a minute. Just one more time, sir.
Just one more time.

178
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:39,309
For what? He's useless.
Completely unresponsive.

179
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:42,411
All right, fella, once more.
Yellow button, center. Center.

180
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:45,889
You don't give up.
There he goes for the red button again.

181
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,755
No, no, he's got it now.
He's going...

182
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,488
[buzzer]

183
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:51,928
[Barking]

184
00:13:57,469 --> 00:13:59,801
At least he's reacting.

185
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:01,464
Oh, no.

186
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:11,739
[Gottlieb] All right, Dooley.
Get that misfit out of here.

187
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:15,844
Dr. Gottlieb. You have to admit,
that's a very interesting reaction.

188
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:18,788
[Albert] I mean, this duck
is a fascinating creature.

189
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:29,765
Okay, Frisby, what have we got here?
Gamma rays on, uh, what?

190
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:33,032
Testing some new
high resistance silicone oils.

191
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:34,902
- [Man] Phenyl type?
- [Frisby] Yeah.

192
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:38,102
[Man] What is the estimated
integrated threshold neutron flux?

193
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:40,668
[Quacking]

194
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:43,774
- What do you mean by that?
- By what?

195
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:46,181
Well, you said "quack."

196
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:48,447
Hey, I didn't say "quack."

197
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,488
[Quacking]

198
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:54,452
[Man] Holy cow!

199
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:56,494
[Static]

200
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:07,296
Oh, Professor.

201
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:10,365
- Is this one of your creatures?
- Yes. How did she get in there?

202
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:13,138
You tell me.
You almost had fried duck.

203
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:15,180
Is she okay?

204
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,772
Oh, sure, no harm.
Just, uh, got a little jolt.

205
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:21,513
But in the future, would you please
keep your friends out of our department?

206
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,077
Yeah, okay.

207
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:26,686
Boy, you really blew it today.

208
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,728
Only thing to do now is find you
a home for retired dropouts.

209
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:34,624
- A duck?
- Yeah.

210
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,463
That's what it is. A duck.

211
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,468
But I want a puppy.

212
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,873
I don't want a dumb old duck.

213
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,504
Look, pal, I didn't
bring it home for a pet.

214
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,015
Then why'd you bring it?

215
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:54,917
It was either that
or let the janitor's wife fricassee it.

216
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:56,978
It was a total wash-out
at the lab and...

217
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:59,183
Wouldn't a puppy be
just as cheap to feed?

218
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:00,953
Darling, we're not gonna keep it.

219
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:03,927
Well, he really had
his heart set on a puppy.

220
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:06,897
Katie, now, we've been
through all of that.

221
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,526
I'm just trying to find a home
for this stupid duck.

222
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:12,399
Maybe that farmer would take it,
the one that comes around

223
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,666
and sells us those vegetables
I can't afford.

224
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,174
- You mean Mr. Gilby?
- Yeah, I guess so.

225
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:20,369
Oh, now see, dear, you're mixed up.

226
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:25,406
Mr. Gilby is the, uh, bakery truck man.
Mr. Purdham is the vegetable man.

227
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,009
Well, Purdham, okay.
I mean, give it to him.

228
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:30,078
It'll have a good home
on his farm.

229
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:33,647
- Probably eat better than we do.
- [Jimmy] Hey, Daddy.

230
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:37,355
I think he likes me.
Watch how he follows me.

231
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:40,398
Come on, boy. Come on. Come on.

232
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:42,696
[Quacking]

233
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:48,205
How would you like a real great name?

234
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:51,071
Charlie. You like that, Charlie?

235
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:52,337
[Quacking]

236
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,482
Maybe I can teach him some tricks.

237
00:16:57,549 --> 00:16:59,949
Him? Good luck.

238
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,152
Um, Albert?

239
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:06,791
[Albert] Hmm?

240
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,850
Uh, I was just thinking.

241
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:10,988
Good for you.

242
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:15,295
You know, uh, instead of giving
that dumb old duck to Mr. Purdham,

243
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,494
uh, maybe Jimmy could
trade it in on a puppy.

244
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:19,503
Now, Katie, we settled all that, okay?

245
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:24,873
Yeah, I know, but it wouldn't cost
you anything and it might help...

246
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:27,002
Never mind.
I shouldn't even mention it.

247
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:30,747
- Mention what?
- Oh, nothing.

248
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:36,053
I'm sure you'll solve it.

249
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:41,058
Okay, Katie, solve what?

250
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:45,891
The generation gap you're creating
between Jimmy over this puppy thing.

251
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:49,623
Katie.

252
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:52,329
Oh, come on, Katie.

253
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:57,706
Honey, you know Jimmy and I have
a very good, close relationship.

254
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:01,302
Of course you do, Albert.

255
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,974
That's why I didn't even mention it.

256
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:09,280
[Jimmy] Daddy! Daddy, help!

257
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:11,285
Help!

258
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:13,485
Daddy, help!

259
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,823
He's gonna kill Charlie.

260
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:18,419
- What?
- [Hooper] Gotcha.

261
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:22,667
- Get out of here.
- [Albert] Leave that duck alone.

262
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:24,827
- Get out of my yard.
- That's our duck.

263
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:28,600
Well, get him out of my pool.
Get your hands off my skimmer.

264
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:31,204
- [Jimmy] Charlie!
- Be careful.

265
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,767
I got you now,
you duck-billed intruder.

266
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,874
[Quacking, barking]

267
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,007
Get your hands off my skimmer.

268
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:41,012
Attaboy, Charlie.

269
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,952
[Katie] Albert!

270
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:47,250
[Hooper] Duke, get that bird
off our slide.

271
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:48,793
Stop that dog!

272
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:51,787
Go, Charlie, go.

273
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:55,300
[Hooper] Bite him in the tail feathers.
Don't let him get away from you.

274
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:59,395
[Albert] Come here, duck.
Come here, duck.

275
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:02,099
If that dog lays a tooth on that duck...

276
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:09,112
- [Albert] Take your skimmer...
- Hooper, let go.

277
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:11,308
[Albert] You're gonna drown him.

278
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:13,475
Come here, duck.

279
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:16,316
If you hit our duck,
I'll report you to the sPCIA.

280
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:17,616
Call your dog, Hooper.

281
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:22,493
Get your duck out of the pool,
he's contaminating it.

282
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:24,153
[Everybody shouting]

283
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:26,697
Oh. Oh!

284
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:30,432
Get your dirty shoes
out of my pool.

285
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:32,627
[Katie] You hit my husband!

286
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:42,973
Come here, Jimmy.
Take the duck.

287
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:44,640
Hurry.

288
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:49,516
- Up the stairs, Duke.
- [Katie] Come on, Albert, hurry.

289
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:51,317
[Albert] Go on.

290
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:54,081
[Albert] Hurry before the dog gets out.

291
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:57,227
[Hooper] Duke, sic 'em. Sic 'em.

292
00:19:57,996 --> 00:20:01,261
Give 'em a good one.
Get 'em, Duke. Sic 'em.

293
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,392
[Barking]

294
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:15,710
Finley, what are you doing in there
with your clothes on?

295
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:17,840
Can't leave you alone for a minute.

296
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,283
[Grumbling]

297
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:27,419
Look, Daddy. Charlie laid an egg.

298
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,993
[Katie] Why, Charlie, you're a mama.

299
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:35,833
[Barking]

300
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:41,229
Twins.

301
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:52,540
[Quacking]

302
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:54,882
Four eggs,
isn't that something?

303
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:58,912
I don't see how she laid any eggs
with that beast barking at her.

304
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:01,926
[Stammering] It was that beast
that caused her to do it.

305
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:04,656
Albert, they hardly know each other.

306
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:07,959
- No, no, I mean...
- I know what you mean.

307
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:10,501
Let's don't discuss it
in front of our "s-o-n."

308
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:13,333
Yeah, we learn all that
stuff in school, anyway.

309
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,870
No, no, no. It's a conditioned reflex.

310
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:19,308
You see, when the dog barks,
the duck lays an egg.

311
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:21,846
I don't know why.
It happened once at the lab.

312
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:24,313
That's not the way
my mother explained it to me.

313
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:30,578
Anyway, the important thing is the money
we'll save growing our own eggs.

314
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:35,091
[Stammering] We're not
eating those eggs.

315
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:39,994
I mean, this duck is, uh... strange.

316
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,198
Oh!

317
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:46,465
- [Quacking]
- Not that, it's an aberration.

318
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:48,938
A biological mutation.

319
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:51,606
- It is?
- Yeah.

320
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:53,770
That's a chemically mixed up duck.

321
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:56,313
It's even been radiated and...

322
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:58,144
We're not eating those eggs.

323
00:21:58,216 --> 00:22:01,083
Good, then we'll hatch them.
Come on, Charlie.

324
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:04,247
[Stammering] Is that all right?
I mean, hatching them?

325
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:08,248
Oh, no. Of course not.
They probably wouldn't hatch, anyway.

326
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:12,627
Only thing to do is bury them,
which I'll do after Jimmy goes to sleep.

327
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,336
[Sighs]

328
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:50,196
[Fred] Albert?

329
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:54,966
- What the devil you doing?
- Nothing, nothing, nothing.

330
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:59,038
Digging a hole at, uh, midnight

331
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:03,172
in your pajamas is... nothing?

332
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:05,808
You know, I'm digging, digging.

333
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:09,285
- For what?
- Night crawlers.

334
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:14,219
Certainly lay big eggs.

335
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,826
[Chuckles]

336
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,625
Go to bed, Albert.

337
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:22,089
You're a nut.

338
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:39,844
[Gasps]

339
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:46,056
[Gottlieb] Dooley?

340
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:47,853
Yes? Yes, Dr. Gottlieb?

341
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:51,828
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes, a, uh, research problem.

342
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:54,730
Oh, uh, come on, come on.

343
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:05,236
[Gottlieb sighs] sit down, sit down.

344
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:10,779
- Well?
- Dr. Gottlieb, is it possible...

345
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:12,840
In science, anything is possible.

346
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:18,083
Yes, but could radiation alter the
molecular structure of a... substance?

347
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:21,250
From organic to inorganic?

348
00:24:21,326 --> 00:24:24,853
So, uh, we're a radio-biologist now,
are we, Dooley?

349
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,522
Just a minute.

350
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:29,557
Yeah.

351
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,597
Try these for starters.

352
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:36,573
- All I wanted to know...
- [Gottlieb] The answer is yes.

353
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,438
But what substance?

354
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:42,574
- Like an egg.
- What kind of an egg?

355
00:24:43,448 --> 00:24:46,383
Doesn't... [sighs]

356
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:51,388
- Chicken, turkey, duck?
- Duck?

357
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:54,220
- Please don't mention duck to me.
- Sorry.

358
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:56,351
Anyway, your experiment has been done.

359
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:59,727
Um, 1903.

360
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:03,063
It was, um... a young medical student

361
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:06,695
at, um, the Royal Viennese Hospital.

362
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:10,571
His name was, um, schultz or Schmaltz...

363
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:12,769
Oh, here. [laughs] Schwartz.

364
00:25:13,378 --> 00:25:16,973
In... In searching
for a chemical background

365
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:19,516
for radiogenic
inflammation from radium,

366
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:24,248
Gottwald Schwartz exposed
an egg to becquerel rays.

367
00:25:24,322 --> 00:25:28,190
Both the organic and inorganic
molecules suffered a change, you see?

368
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,693
Yes, yes, yes.

369
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:32,662
There was no change
in the white of the egg.

370
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:35,359
But there was conspicuous change
in the yolk.

371
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:37,298
Yolk, that's it. That's it.

372
00:25:44,743 --> 00:25:47,712
I mean, that's [clears throat]
Quite interesting.

373
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:50,882
Didn't, uh...

374
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:54,813
...change it into any kind of, uh...

375
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:56,376
...metal, did it?

376
00:25:57,789 --> 00:25:59,347
Metal?

377
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,456
What do you want, Dooley, gold?

378
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,730
Well, you said anything was possible.

379
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:15,796
Possible, yes. But...

380
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:18,575
...making a golden egg?

381
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:25,307
- That's for Aesop's Fables, isn't it?
- Yes, yes.

382
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:29,877
But, uh, gold has been made, uh,
synthetically, hasn't it?

383
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:33,891
Yes, with nuclear bombardment, but...

384
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:37,451
...we know what that costs, don't we?
It doesn't pay.

385
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:41,162
- [Phone rings]
- Excuse me.

386
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:47,197
[Gottlieb] Dr. Gottlieb.
I'll be right there.

387
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:49,297
Excuse me.

388
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:53,737
Uh, I have to go recheck
the IQ of the chimp. [chuckles]

389
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:58,538
Hundred and forty. Higher than mine.

390
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:29,612
We've run quite a few tests
on that metal of yours.

391
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:31,740
- Yes...
- Darndest thing we ever ran across.

392
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:34,114
- But is it...
- You won't believe this report.

393
00:27:34,185 --> 00:27:35,777
It's... Well, it's wild.

394
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:37,719
- Then it's not...
- Look here, Dooley.

395
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:41,623
The metal contains traces
of D-Galacturonic acid.

396
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:43,524
Now, isn't that wild?

397
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:48,259
- Do you know what that is? It's pectin.
- Pectin?

398
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:51,268
Pectin that's been
hydrolyzed under intense heat.

399
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:54,032
Pectin comes from apple peelings.

400
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:57,932
Applesauce.

401
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:01,172
No, no, it's true. And look,
it also has a trace of garlic in it.

402
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:03,806
I don't want to hear any more,
as long as it's not gold.

403
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:06,282
What do you mean?
It's practically pure gold.

404
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:10,747
- What?
- It has some weird impurities in it.

405
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:14,121
There's one element we can't even
identify. Not related to any of...

406
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:16,956
- Pure gold.
...the 103 known chemical elements.

407
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:19,519
Now, Mr. Dooley, you didn't, um...

408
00:28:19,597 --> 00:28:22,725
You didn't get hold of
a moon rock, did you?

409
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:26,532
Moon rock? Me? No, no, no.
I've never even been out of California.

410
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:30,370
- Where'd you dig up this gold?
- Dig? I didn't dig.

411
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,768
- A plaster deposit?
- Well, yes...

412
00:28:32,844 --> 00:28:35,404
It was deposited, you might say.
Thank you very much.

413
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,176
Wait, don't you want your report?
You paid for it.

414
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:39,739
Oh, yes. Yes.

415
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:42,987
Report, thank you very much.

416
00:28:46,624 --> 00:28:49,184
So, this is an assayer's report,
so what?

417
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,125
So, that's why I need a lawyer.

418
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:54,495
- To help me incorporate.
- Incorporate what?

419
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:58,559
Fred, that sample
is the yolk of a duck egg.

420
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:01,697
Oh, come on, Albert.

421
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:05,072
I know how incredible this must sound
to your legal, pragmatic mind,

422
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:07,737
but in 1903,
a Viennese scientist...

423
00:29:08,713 --> 00:29:11,511
You ever read Aesop's Fables?
One about the goose?

424
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:14,177
Do you think you ought to be
driving in your condition?

425
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:17,710
I'm telling you, Fred, that fable
may be scientifically feasible.

426
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:19,484
All right. Pull over, I'll drive.

427
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:21,787
Okay, skeptic.

428
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:25,660
I'm going to show you one of
those gold eggs actually being laid.

429
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,302
- [Brakes screech]
- Watch it, Albert.

430
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:39,606
You crazy ding-a-ling driver, Orlo!

431
00:29:39,677 --> 00:29:43,909
Orlo! I'm not even in the car.
That's Arvin. Bigot.

432
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:49,246
Now you just lie there and relax

433
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,483
and forget all about
that nasty, old Treasury office.

434
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:55,458
Thank you, dear.
You're a good person.

435
00:29:59,597 --> 00:30:01,656
[Engine revving, popping]

436
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:05,033
[Albert] Come on, Fred.

437
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:07,599
[Grunts]

438
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:11,672
I'll get the duck, make Hooper's dog
bark at it and you'll see.

439
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:14,576
Albert, I'm glad you're home.
Go upstairs and talk to Jim.

440
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:18,047
Not now. I've got news for you.
Our financial worries are over.

441
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:20,448
He's broken-hearted
because I was trying...

442
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:24,147
You're not listening. We're going
to be rich. Beyond our wildest dreams.

443
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:26,520
Oh, honey,
I always knew you'd make good.

444
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:30,049
Even when Papa kept saying, "Don't marry
that no-good, lazy, you-know."

445
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:32,153
It's nothing I did. It's Charlie.

446
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,562
Remember those eggs
I was going to bury?

447
00:30:34,632 --> 00:30:38,124
Brace yourself. They're gold.

448
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:49,875
Uh... Don't look that way.
I'm not kidding you. It's true.

449
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:51,813
Oh, Albert, I believe you.

450
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:55,375
- What's the matter?
- I gave the duck to Mr. Purdham.

451
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:58,681
- [Mumbles]
- Albert, you told me to.

452
00:30:58,756 --> 00:30:59,916
[Mumbles]

453
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:02,357
I was sorry I did,
because Jimmy's been crying...

454
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:04,327
No, no, no.

455
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:07,994
- Oh! Where does Purdham live?
- I'm not sure.

456
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:10,364
- Think, think, think.
- I am!

457
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:11,959
Oh, I'm trying.

458
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:13,663
Uh, uh, uh...

459
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:16,832
- Where does Purdham live?
- Try the cookie jar.

460
00:31:16,908 --> 00:31:19,468
- The cookie jar?
- That's where I keep my addresses.

461
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:23,106
We've got to find that duck,

462
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:26,014
before anything happens to him.

463
00:31:26,784 --> 00:31:28,752
[Albert] Chicken chow mein.

464
00:31:31,122 --> 00:31:34,990
Purdham. Purdham. Oak Road.
Come on.

465
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:39,186
[Albert] Get in the car, Fred.

466
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:45,367
[Engine revving]

467
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:48,572
[Jimmy] Hey, Daddy, wait.

468
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:03,046
Well, look, I'll, uh...
Guess I could...

469
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:07,590
...give you five dollars for it.

470
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:11,561
Well, I know I never
turn down a good deal.

471
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:14,496
You'll find the duck in the pen,
back of the barn yonder.

472
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:16,260
Thanks.

473
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:25,203
Hello, Mr. Purdham.

474
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,369
[Quacking]

475
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:31,915
[Albert] Oh, no. There's got to be
a million of them.

476
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,048
[Jimmy] Charlie.

477
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:42,183
Charlie.

478
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:45,894
Charlie. Charlie.

479
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:50,356
Charlie. Where are you, Charlie?

480
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:53,202
This is getting us no place.

481
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:57,105
This duck doesn't respond
to normal things, like its name.

482
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:04,139
- You know what we need?
- A good psychiatrist.

483
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:05,978
- No.
- [Calling for Charlie]

484
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:09,110
We need something
it does respond to.

485
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:10,814
Start barking, Fred.

486
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:14,615
It's our only chance, Fred. Bark.

487
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:16,951
[Barking]

488
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,235
Wait a minute.
What am I doing?

489
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:28,135
A sane adult, with a law degree

490
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:30,606
crawling around a barnyard,
barking at fowls?

491
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:33,508
Trying to find some stupid duck
who lays solid gold...

492
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:36,979
solid gold eggs!

493
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:42,012
I'll never see Charlie again.

494
00:33:42,086 --> 00:33:44,782
Come on, we're not going
to give up till we're licked.

495
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,915
We'll find him. Charlie?

496
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:53,027
[Barking, quacking]

497
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:56,729
[Katie calling Charlie]

498
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:05,070
Hey, where you going?

499
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:08,472
They're getting away from us!

500
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,580
Come on, Fred.

501
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:15,785
Whoa, whoa. Come back.

502
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:20,319
Get back here. Go back, ducks.

503
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:23,557
- They're getting into the pond.
- Head them off.

504
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:25,994
Back, you ducks! Get back!

505
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,862
Get them out of the water.
Get them back on the shore.

506
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:33,332
Here, here.
What's going on?

507
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:37,170
- You said only one duck.
- Something happened to the gate and...

508
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:39,471
And get these critters
back in the pen.

509
00:34:39,544 --> 00:34:42,035
- [Katie] Get back.
- [Purdham] Back, back.

510
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:44,047
- [Barking]
- Back, back.

511
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:52,052
Charlie.

512
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:55,657
Charlie! Oh, Charlie!

513
00:34:55,927 --> 00:35:00,159
Daddy, I found him! I found Charlie.

514
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:07,162
Hey, wait.
Come back, help me.

515
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:13,004
- I knew I'd find her.
- You sure it's her, son?

516
00:35:13,077 --> 00:35:15,773
I know it is. It's Charlie.

517
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:19,749
Well, there's one way to find out.
Hold her on the ground, Fred.

518
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,523
Maybe only Hooper's dog can do it.

519
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,657
No reflection on you, dear.

520
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:34,020
[Barking]

521
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:40,726
Why, Albert, you don't
sound like Hooper's dog at all.

522
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,705
Uh, he goes more like...

523
00:35:42,773 --> 00:35:45,503
[barking]

524
00:35:45,576 --> 00:35:49,512
Hey, I think she's got it. Pitch.

525
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,605
Pitch. It might be a matter of pitch.

526
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:57,014
[Ding]

527
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:08,790
Come on. Yeah, Charlie.

528
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:22,275
What do you think now, skeptic?

529
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,541
Baby,

530
00:36:24,615 --> 00:36:27,277
you're looking at a believer.

531
00:36:28,085 --> 00:36:30,610
Figuring it's weight in troy ounces,

532
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,986
at the pegged gold price,

533
00:36:33,891 --> 00:36:36,291
that's over 900 bucks a yolk.

534
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,452
That's right.

535
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:40,224
If she laid four eggs in,
how long did you say?

536
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:44,662
- About ten minutes.
- Uh, that would be...

537
00:36:45,636 --> 00:36:48,662
...over 20,000 dollars an hour.

538
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:51,640
And if she worked
a six-hour day, uh,

539
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:54,041
give or take a couple
of coffee breaks, uh,

540
00:36:54,111 --> 00:36:56,636
corn breaks.

541
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:58,978
Al, baby!

542
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,848
We're talking about
a 100,000 dollar a day business.

543
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:05,377
That's right. If I can find the formula
to keep her producing.

544
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:08,357
Oh, you'll do it. You'll do it.

545
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:12,294
The big problem is, how do we
legally protect our fortune?

546
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:17,323
"Our" fortune? What do you mean,
"our" fortune?

547
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:20,632
Look, Al, sweetheart,

548
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:22,900
I'm only trying
to save you money.

549
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:27,001
By making me a partner, you'll save
all those exorbitant lawyer's fees.

550
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,876
- Uh-huh.
- I'll have to devote full time,

551
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:31,710
figuring how to incorporate a duck,

552
00:37:31,782 --> 00:37:34,216
and not have the
internal revenuers on our neck.

553
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:36,845
I got your clothes
all nice and dry for you.

554
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,286
Oh, fine.

555
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:42,191
How did you manage to do this, Katie?

556
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,989
Oh, it was no trouble, really.

557
00:37:44,061 --> 00:37:46,052
Thanks.

558
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:49,490
Anyway, the thing to do is sit tight
until I figure things out.

559
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:52,161
And don't tell anybody
about this, especially, uh...

560
00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:54,033
- Hooper?
- Right.

561
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:57,370
We don't want that government
stool pigeon snooping around.

562
00:37:58,209 --> 00:38:01,576
The first thing I'm going to do is
get rid of that junk heap I'm driving.

563
00:38:01,646 --> 00:38:04,376
I saw the most fantastic
yellow sports car.

564
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:05,915
Hold it.

565
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:08,713
- Don't spend any of that money yet.
- What?

566
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:11,016
Make no changes
in your living standards.

567
00:38:11,088 --> 00:38:13,886
- You mean not pay our bills?
- Bills, fine.

568
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:18,327
But we can't risk raising suspicions
until we get this legally protected.

569
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:22,131
Now, let's try
and get some sleep.

570
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:25,495
Or, uh...

571
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:30,139
...do you think we ought to get the duck
and bark out a few more thou?

572
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:33,643
No, the duck's asleep with Jimmy
and I don't want Jimmy disturbed.

573
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:34,871
And, Fred...

574
00:38:34,945 --> 00:38:38,904
Don't forget to bring my robe back.
That's not part of the deal.

575
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,507
Okay.

576
00:38:40,584 --> 00:38:42,142
Partner.

577
00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:54,125
[Katie] Albert.

578
00:38:54,198 --> 00:38:57,827
Do you think maybe now we could
afford to re-shingle our house?

579
00:39:00,137 --> 00:39:02,230
Re-shingle our house?

580
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:05,107
We could re-shingle the Pentagon.

581
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:06,973
We could buy the Pentagon.

582
00:39:07,044 --> 00:39:10,207
Well... what would we do with it?

583
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:13,810
I'm only trying to give you
an idea of our potential.

584
00:39:13,884 --> 00:39:16,819
We have what other men
have only dreamed of.

585
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:21,883
- It's kind of scary, isn't it?
- You bet it is.

586
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:25,185
Albert, just how rich will we be?

587
00:39:25,262 --> 00:39:28,993
So rich that we could not
possibly spend it all.

588
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:31,034
- We could try.
- Now wait a minute.

589
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:34,697
- I just want to help all I can.
- Fine, but let's not get carried away.

590
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:36,637
We must keep our sense of values.

591
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:39,175
Aesop's fable warns us
against avarice.

592
00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:42,144
- Against who?
- Greed, greed.

593
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,443
The fellow in the fable
let greed destroy him.

594
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:47,973
We won't do that. We're gonna play it
cool, keep our feet on the ground.

595
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:50,577
- Albert?
- Hmm?

596
00:39:52,089 --> 00:39:53,351
What?

597
00:39:56,927 --> 00:40:01,193
Let's take our cool feet...
and go to bed.

598
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:05,793
Okay, honey.

599
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:25,278
Cute.

600
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:28,955
I think you ought to close the window.
He might catch cold.

601
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:31,620
Oh. Oh, right.

602
00:40:59,924 --> 00:41:01,915
Good idea.

603
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:20,643
Now what?

604
00:41:21,245 --> 00:41:23,839
Some sense of values.

605
00:41:24,348 --> 00:41:26,839
What do you mean?

606
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:29,477
Boy, he sure was right.

607
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:34,218
- Who was?
- You know.

608
00:41:40,531 --> 00:41:41,793
I do?

609
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:44,130
Aesop.

610
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:50,797
[Katie] Jimmy, your lunch.

611
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:56,803
Be sure and take good care
of Charlie while I'm gone, Mom.

612
00:41:56,881 --> 00:41:59,076
Don't worry, I will.
Now, run along.

613
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:03,082
And don't let Mr. Hooper's dog
get him, either.

614
00:42:03,153 --> 00:42:06,145
Will you hurry up? You're gonna be
late for school, goodbye.

615
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:08,720
[Telephone rings]

616
00:42:17,401 --> 00:42:19,460
Yes. Who?

617
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,200
Oh, uh, the bank.

618
00:42:25,276 --> 00:42:27,540
Well, hi.

619
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:30,270
Bad checks?

620
00:42:30,347 --> 00:42:34,977
Uh, uh, well, you printed them.

621
00:42:36,153 --> 00:42:39,611
Oh, now, how could a big bank like you

622
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:42,158
have insufficient funds
and stay in business?

623
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:46,856
No, Mrs. Dooley. Not us, you.
We've explained several times

624
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:50,298
that you cannot write checks for more
money than you have in the bank.

625
00:42:50,367 --> 00:42:52,392
[On phone] You could
be arrested for that.

626
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:53,936
Oh, no. Please don't.

627
00:42:54,004 --> 00:42:57,565
Please, don't call Mr. Dooley.
I can get the money somehow.

628
00:42:58,042 --> 00:43:00,704
[Stammering] Hold on the phone,
just a minute.

629
00:43:14,124 --> 00:43:16,319
[Barking, quacking]

630
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,531
Mr. Meaker, I, uh...

631
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:35,340
I guess you'll just have to
call my husband about that...

632
00:43:35,412 --> 00:43:37,312
[ding]

633
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:39,482
Oh, wait. Wait.

634
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:42,678
Uh, I'll be right down.

635
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:47,717
And what is this, Mrs. Dooley?

636
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:50,316
I'm overdrawn and that's
to un-overdraw me.

637
00:43:51,161 --> 00:43:54,528
Yes, you are overdrawn.

638
00:43:54,598 --> 00:43:57,431
But, what is this thing?

639
00:43:58,068 --> 00:44:00,832
Thing? That's gold.

640
00:44:00,904 --> 00:44:04,704
Worth over 900 troy ounce dollars.

641
00:44:04,775 --> 00:44:06,640
And that's my deposit slip for it.

642
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:09,110
You recognize that, don't you?

643
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:11,010
One moment, please.

644
00:44:15,552 --> 00:44:17,952
[Phone rings]

645
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:33,993
[Clears throat]

646
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:40,704
- Next, please.
- This way, please.

647
00:44:40,778 --> 00:44:43,474
What kind of a bank is this, anyway?

648
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:55,014
Sit down.

649
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:00,156
Mrs. Dooley,

650
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:03,791
we can hardly take
a trinket for a deposit.

651
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:07,701
Trinket? Haven't you bankers
ever heard of gold?

652
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:12,470
Mrs. Dooley, even if that were
gold bouillon there's nothing...

653
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:13,532
Bouillon?

654
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:16,773
Processed gold
as distinguished from raw gold.

655
00:45:16,847 --> 00:45:20,647
The only thing we can do with this
is turn it over to the Federal Reserve.

656
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:23,778
That wouldn't do very much
for your account now, would it?

657
00:45:23,854 --> 00:45:26,687
Well, I should say not.
I'll just take it to another bank.

658
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:29,487
They'll have to do the same thing.

659
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:33,257
The only possible place you
could take that is to a refinery.

660
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:35,560
Refinery?

661
00:45:51,148 --> 00:45:54,015
- Hi.
- Hi, honey.

662
00:45:55,018 --> 00:45:57,851
- Where'd you get the hat?
- What hat?

663
00:45:58,622 --> 00:46:02,251
Oh, now Albert, it was on sale.

664
00:46:02,326 --> 00:46:05,887
You know, if you wrote a check
for that hat, we're overdrawn again.

665
00:46:05,963 --> 00:46:09,364
No, we're not.
I deposited over 900 dollars today.

666
00:46:11,835 --> 00:46:14,770
- Where did you get 900 dollars?
- From the refinery.

667
00:46:16,206 --> 00:46:18,697
- You haven't been in the eggs?
- No, not those.

668
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:20,744
Charlie laid one for me.

669
00:46:24,982 --> 00:46:28,782
- Why did you take it to the refinery?
- Well, the bank told me to.

670
00:46:28,852 --> 00:46:30,945
The bank!

671
00:46:31,021 --> 00:46:34,457
You took it to the...
Did you tell the newspapers, too?

672
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:37,350
Well, no, Albert, just the bank.

673
00:46:37,427 --> 00:46:40,453
They told me if I didn't cover
my bad checks I would be arrested.

674
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:42,795
- Would you rather I got arrested?
- No, no, no.

675
00:46:44,034 --> 00:46:46,832
Some husband,
he wants his wife in jail.

676
00:46:46,904 --> 00:46:50,670
Didn't you hear Fred say not to tell
anybody and not to spend the money?

677
00:46:50,741 --> 00:46:53,505
Yes, but what's
the use of having it?

678
00:46:55,078 --> 00:46:57,171
- Hi, partners.
- Don't tell him what I did.

679
00:46:57,247 --> 00:46:59,715
- What did she do?
- I sold an egg to a refinery.

680
00:46:59,783 --> 00:47:01,876
- Good.
- What?

681
00:47:01,952 --> 00:47:05,183
That's all we can do because we
don't have a license to handle gold.

682
00:47:05,255 --> 00:47:07,280
- Well, then get us a license.
- Oh, sure.

683
00:47:07,357 --> 00:47:10,019
Can you see going to
the U.s. Treasury Dept. And saying,

684
00:47:10,093 --> 00:47:13,654
"I'd like a gold license for my little
ducky who lays gold eggs."

685
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:16,130
- I see what you mean.
- Couldn't Hooper help you?

686
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,600
- He works for the U.s. Treasury.
- Hooper?

687
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:21,763
He'd confiscate our duck so fast,
it'd singe its feathers off.

688
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:24,637
Right now, you've got to get
all the gold off the premises.

689
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:26,676
- Why?
- Federal gold regulations.

690
00:47:26,743 --> 00:47:29,541
You could get ten years in the jug
for hoarding. Read this.

691
00:47:31,582 --> 00:47:34,813
We'll have to think up
a good story to tell the refineries.

692
00:47:34,885 --> 00:47:35,874
Why?

693
00:47:37,154 --> 00:47:39,622
You go around trying
to peddle gold duck eggs,

694
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,487
they'll lock you up
in the nut farm.

695
00:47:41,558 --> 00:47:43,924
I did it and they didn't lock me up.

696
00:47:43,994 --> 00:47:45,962
Yes, but you're...

697
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:48,825
Wait a minute.

698
00:47:48,899 --> 00:47:51,527
You didn't tell them
where the gold came from, did you?

699
00:47:52,502 --> 00:47:54,868
- Well, he asked me.
- Oh, no.

700
00:47:55,505 --> 00:47:57,803
Now the whole world
will be after that duck.

701
00:47:57,875 --> 00:48:02,437
- What did he say when you told him?
- Nothing, he just laughed.

702
00:48:02,512 --> 00:48:04,537
- He laughed?
- Uh-huh.

703
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:09,183
He just... laughed?

704
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:12,386
[Chuckling]

705
00:48:12,956 --> 00:48:15,117
Do you hear that, Albert?
He just laughed.

706
00:48:15,192 --> 00:48:17,888
Don't you see?
She solved our whole problem.

707
00:48:17,961 --> 00:48:20,828
She can tell them the truth
and they'll never believe it.

708
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:23,833
And they won't lock her up,
no matter how nutty it sounds.

709
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:27,894
- Now, listen, sweetheart...
- I'm not so sure I want my wife...

710
00:48:29,206 --> 00:48:31,504
- What is that, Fred? A new suit?
- [Scoffs]

711
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:34,635
Now, listen sweetheart,
here's a list of refineries.

712
00:48:34,711 --> 00:48:36,702
Now don't sell
too many eggs at one time.

713
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:40,375
- Okay.
- You got a new briefcase, too.

714
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:42,145
It's nothing, Al, baby.

715
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:43,743
Keep moving around.

716
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:46,687
It might look suspicious unloading
too many at one place.

717
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,554
Got it.

718
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:51,253
Listen, could I buy some new clothes
to wear for this?

719
00:48:51,328 --> 00:48:54,297
Oh, no. No, no, no.

720
00:48:56,233 --> 00:48:58,633
We mustn't spend the money.

721
00:49:06,677 --> 00:49:09,305
- [Man] Mrs. Dooley?
- Yes. Yes.

722
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:14,509
This is exceptionally
high grade ore.

723
00:49:14,584 --> 00:49:16,575
Our cashier's making
a check out for you.

724
00:49:16,653 --> 00:49:18,951
- Thank you.
- These, um...

725
00:49:19,022 --> 00:49:21,081
These nuggets are very interesting.

726
00:49:21,158 --> 00:49:23,422
All seem to be
the identical size and shape.

727
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:27,657
- Yes, I noticed that.
- I was curious how they got that way.

728
00:49:28,198 --> 00:49:31,133
Would you believe
a duck laid them?

729
00:49:32,502 --> 00:49:34,834
- A duck laid them.
- [Laughs]

730
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:41,440
- What kind of duck was that?
- A white one.

731
00:49:41,511 --> 00:49:43,911
A white one.
Little, white duck.

732
00:49:45,115 --> 00:49:47,140
- Thank you. There you are.
- Thank you.

733
00:49:47,217 --> 00:49:50,152
[Stammering] Mrs. Dooley, listen,
about these nuggets...

734
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:52,814
I really have to dash.
Bye-bye.

735
00:49:52,889 --> 00:49:57,189
- We don't have your address.
- That's all right. I have it.

736
00:50:13,243 --> 00:50:16,940
Hello, Treasury Department?
This is Carter, down at Alco.

737
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:19,380
I got something really odd here.

738
00:50:19,449 --> 00:50:21,314
You might want to check it out.

739
00:50:32,262 --> 00:50:35,231
[Laughter]

740
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:49,738
[Making revving noise with mouth]

741
00:51:04,761 --> 00:51:06,160
[Albert] Beauty.

742
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:11,163
Say, uh,
what's the price of a car like that?

743
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:15,398
Seven thousand nine hundred
and ninety-five dollars.

744
00:51:15,472 --> 00:51:18,669
- That's not even a dozen eggs.
- I beg your pardon.

745
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:23,645
Nothing. You wouldn't happen to have
a layaway plan, would you?

746
00:51:23,713 --> 00:51:26,910
- Hardly.
- No, I didn't think so.

747
00:51:26,983 --> 00:51:29,816
Well, I can't buy it now, but...

748
00:51:31,988 --> 00:51:33,717
I'll be back.

749
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:36,851
[Laughter]

750
00:51:54,911 --> 00:51:57,243
According to the phone calls

751
00:51:57,314 --> 00:52:01,114
that have been pouring into
this U.s. Treasury Dept. Office,

752
00:52:01,184 --> 00:52:06,247
this map represents certain refineries
that have been receiving these...

753
00:52:06,323 --> 00:52:08,655
...odd gold nuggets.

754
00:52:08,725 --> 00:52:11,216
We don't know just who the gang is,

755
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:15,196
but, undoubtedly,
it's an underworld operation.

756
00:52:15,265 --> 00:52:19,759
Otherwise, why would they spread those
nuggets around those various refineries?

757
00:52:19,836 --> 00:52:22,031
You figure it's Mafia controlled, chief?

758
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:25,902
- Probably something worse.
- Worse?

759
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:33,275
Gentlemen, they may have
learned how to make gold.

760
00:52:34,918 --> 00:52:37,216
Well, that's not very probable.

761
00:52:37,287 --> 00:52:41,189
That can only be done by atomic
bombardment and the cost is prohibitive.

762
00:52:41,258 --> 00:52:43,158
I know that.

763
00:52:43,226 --> 00:52:46,423
The point I'm trying to make is that
they've found a way to make gold

764
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:49,226
cheap enough to put on the market.

765
00:52:49,299 --> 00:52:53,065
Our top chemists can't even identify
some of the elements,

766
00:52:53,136 --> 00:52:58,335
and there are traces of such bizarre
impurities as apple pectin.

767
00:53:00,043 --> 00:53:02,705
Apples in gold?

768
00:53:02,779 --> 00:53:04,269
[Rutledge] Don't laugh.

769
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:07,714
Remember what happened to common,
every day, ordinary bread mold?

770
00:53:08,451 --> 00:53:09,850
Penicillin.

771
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:14,551
But Mr. Morgan here,
of the Federal Reserve Bank

772
00:53:14,624 --> 00:53:17,184
has something further to say to us
on the subject.

773
00:53:18,495 --> 00:53:20,895
Gentlemen, this...

774
00:53:21,598 --> 00:53:26,160
...this thing just cannot happen.

775
00:53:26,236 --> 00:53:29,672
I mean, money...
money is the greatest...

776
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:33,275
What we've got to do is ferret out

777
00:53:33,343 --> 00:53:36,107
and stop this nefarious gang of...

778
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:41,612
I hesitate to think
what would happen

779
00:53:41,685 --> 00:53:43,915
if this were to get out of this room.

780
00:53:43,987 --> 00:53:45,750

- [Clears throat]

781

Excuse me.

783
00:53:51,595 --> 00:53:53,620
Yes, he is, just a sec.

784
00:53:53,697 --> 00:53:54,686
For you.

stock Exchange, he says it's urgent.

[Laughter]

790
00:54:12,716 --> 00:54:15,082

791
00:54:17,053 --> 00:54:19,248
[Stammering] Where did you hear that?

792
00:54:19,322 --> 00:54:21,187

Oh, no, Bob.

794
00:54:23,994 --> 00:54:27,828
No, no, no. Absolutely nothing to that.
Nothing to it at all.

795
00:54:27,897 --> 00:54:31,298
Well, we have had a little flap
about gold around here,

796
00:54:31,368 --> 00:54:34,804
but everything
is absolutely under control.

797
00:54:34,871 --> 00:54:38,602
You tell Wall street just to relax.

798
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,600
Right, Bob.

799
00:54:41,745 --> 00:54:44,009

Oh, no.
[Stammering] That's just a rumor.

809
00:55:17,547 --> 00:55:21,916
Rumor or not, Ed, this could play hob
with our foreign monetary agreements.

right on top of this thing.

It is a plot.

fabricating the stuff, we're done in.

an ounce, we make it $8.95.

00:58:09,686 --> 00:58:11,278
Hi, neighbor.

855
00:58:11,354 --> 00:58:13,345
How's it going there, friend?

856
00:58:13,423 --> 00:58:15,357
Fine.

857
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:23,723
Oh, um...

858
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:27,099
Having a little vacation.
I thought I'd spend it...

859
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:29,161
...fixing up the house.

860
00:58:29,239 --> 00:58:30,900
Have fun.

861
00:58:40,049 --> 00:58:43,018
Hooper suspects something.
Did you tell him anything?

862
00:58:43,086 --> 00:58:45,987
- You forgot to kiss me.
- Answer me, did you?

863
00:58:46,055 --> 00:58:47,886
I haven't even talked to him.

864
00:58:47,957 --> 00:58:50,949
- Well, how about Jimmy?
- Yes, I talked to him.

865
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:53,052
- He's our son, remember?
- I know that.

866
00:58:53,129 --> 00:58:55,097
Why are you so suspicious of Hooper?

867
00:58:55,164 --> 00:58:57,564
He's being friendly,
what more proof do you need?

868
00:58:57,834 --> 00:58:59,927
[Honking]

869
00:59:11,247 --> 00:59:12,737
Fred!

870
00:59:12,815 --> 00:59:15,648
- How about that car?
- Beauty, isn't she? Look...

871
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:19,620
Wait, what happened to not spending
money and no change in living standards?

872
00:59:19,689 --> 00:59:21,953
Right and my new idea
will save us a bundle...

873
00:59:22,025 --> 00:59:24,619
- That's the car I had my eye on.
- Good taste, Al, baby.

874
00:59:24,694 --> 00:59:28,186
Old Freddie-boy is going to see you
get a whole stable full of them.

875
00:59:31,167 --> 00:59:34,534
- Why can't we have a car like that?
- Katie, Katie, Katie...

876
00:59:34,604 --> 00:59:38,301
What's the matter, is that all
you think about, material possessions?

877
00:59:38,374 --> 00:59:41,741
Here I am, slaving my head
to the bone while you... Albert!

878
00:59:41,811 --> 00:59:44,177
How about that
for a company name?

879
00:59:44,814 --> 00:59:47,282
Dooley's Wrought Iron
sauna Baths?

880
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:49,682
- Yeah.
- What does that have to do with gold?

881
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:52,118
Nothing. It's a sure loser.

882
00:59:52,188 --> 00:59:53,746
A great tax write-off.

883
00:59:53,823 --> 00:59:56,451
Fine. I can tell you,
we got bigger problems than that.

884
00:59:56,526 --> 00:59:59,393
- New ones?
- Hooper's suspicious, for one thing.

885
00:59:59,462 --> 01:00:01,953
- Hooper?
- Yeah, he spoke to me.

886
01:00:02,031 --> 01:00:06,263
Besides Hooper, I still cannot identify
the radioactive element in our gold.

887
01:00:06,336 --> 01:00:09,237
If I can't identify it,
I don't know what its half-life is.

888
01:00:09,305 --> 01:00:13,139
- If I don't know its half-life...
- Hold it. What is this half-life?

889
01:00:13,209 --> 01:00:16,201
The rate of disintegration
of a radioactive substance.

890
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:19,077
In other words,
it could run out.

891
01:00:19,148 --> 01:00:20,775
Run out?

892
01:00:21,884 --> 01:00:24,079
You mean our duck
could stop laying gold eggs?

893
01:00:24,153 --> 01:00:25,984
Exactly.

894
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:30,615
Well... You mean that duck could be
washed up right now?

895
01:00:30,693 --> 01:00:32,058
It's possible.

896
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:35,120
Well, get it, Al. Get it and check.

897
01:00:36,366 --> 01:00:37,799
Katie.

898
01:00:38,201 --> 01:00:39,828
Katie, bring the duck.

899
01:00:39,902 --> 01:00:43,065
You don't have to shout.
I have 20l20 hearing.

900
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:45,266
- Where's Charlie?
- Out.

901
01:00:45,942 --> 01:00:47,273
What do you mean out?

902
01:00:47,343 --> 01:00:50,312
Jimmy took him for a ride in that
cute car with the Wadlow boys.

903
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:52,348
The Wadlow boys?

904
01:00:52,415 --> 01:00:57,148
Not that! The way those maniacs drive,
there goes our Charlie. Come on.

905
01:00:57,220 --> 01:01:00,553
You guys said you'd take
me and Charlie for a ride.

906
01:01:00,623 --> 01:01:02,454
Take it easy, man.
We will.

907
01:01:02,525 --> 01:01:04,356
Can't you just put the battery in? Ow!

908
01:01:05,728 --> 01:01:07,127
- Go help him.
- Hey.

909
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:14,431
Look, if you're gonna hang around
here, man, you gotta shape up, okay?

910
01:01:21,544 --> 01:01:25,173
Hey, get that duck off there, he'll fry!
Get him off!

911
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:33,845
- Hey, Arvin, look. He likes it.
- Huh?

912
01:01:38,327 --> 01:01:40,352
[Orlo] He's outta sight.

913
01:01:44,834 --> 01:01:48,167
Jimmy, you want to sell him?
We'll give you two bucks cash.

914
01:01:48,237 --> 01:01:51,229
No, sir. He's my friend.

915
01:01:51,941 --> 01:01:54,171
I got an idea.

916
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:06,920
[Radio plays music]

917
01:02:07,924 --> 01:02:10,586
[Boys laughing]

918
01:02:11,794 --> 01:02:14,228
[Honking]

919
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:21,461
[Jimmy] Go, Charlie. Great.

920
01:02:32,014 --> 01:02:35,814
- What do you think you're doing?
- Don't do that, we're having fun.

921
01:02:35,885 --> 01:02:37,352
The fun's over, son.

922
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:39,945
But they're gonna take me and Charlie
for a ride.

923
01:02:40,022 --> 01:02:42,456
Oh, no. No, no, no.

924
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:45,050
They're not taking this duck
in that death trap.

925
01:02:45,128 --> 01:02:47,892
Hold on, Mr. Dooley.
Doesn't that duck belong to Jimmy?

926
01:02:47,964 --> 01:02:50,728
Yeah, you're violating his civil rights.

927
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:54,634
It's not a civil rights case.
It's property rights.

928
01:02:54,704 --> 01:02:55,728
Hitlers.

929
01:02:59,575 --> 01:03:01,509
[Barking]

930
01:03:01,577 --> 01:03:05,035
Albert, Jimmy's upstairs crying.
What did you do to him?

931
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:07,048
I didn't do anything to him.

932
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:10,142
I'm just protecting the duck.
We can't take chances like that.

933
01:03:10,219 --> 01:03:13,211
[Fred] In fact, we have to take
it away from Jimmy altogether.

934
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:14,756
[Albert] I guess you're right.

935
01:03:14,824 --> 01:03:17,418
[Katie] You can't do that.
Jimmy loves that duck.

936
01:03:17,493 --> 01:03:20,155
It's his pal, now that
you've turned against him.

937
01:03:20,229 --> 01:03:21,560
Turned against him?

938
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:24,293
This is all academic if Charlie
can't produce anymore.

939
01:03:24,367 --> 01:03:26,267
Come on, Al, baby. Come on.

940
01:03:26,335 --> 01:03:28,030
[Barking]

941
01:03:34,243 --> 01:03:35,972
[Ding]

942
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:10,271
[Laughter]

943
01:04:13,749 --> 01:04:15,011
[Hooper's wife] Finley!

944
01:04:18,554 --> 01:04:22,217
Serves you right... masher.

945
01:04:32,301 --> 01:04:34,565
Uh, Jimmy? Hi, Jimmy.

946
01:04:34,637 --> 01:04:36,764
Getting big, aren't you?

947
01:04:36,839 --> 01:04:39,831
Why don't you come over here,
I got something to show you.

948
01:04:39,909 --> 01:04:42,036
I'm not supposed
to go into your yard.

949
01:04:42,111 --> 01:04:46,207
That's all right.
I've got a present for you. Come on.

950
01:04:49,118 --> 01:04:51,985
- That's for me?
- If you want it.

951
01:04:52,054 --> 01:04:54,852
My little nephew outgrew it.

952
01:04:54,924 --> 01:04:56,721
Boy, oh, boy.

953
01:04:58,961 --> 01:05:00,326
Vroom, vroom.

954
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:03,957
Say, this is a nice duck
you've got here.

955
01:05:04,033 --> 01:05:06,866
I'll bet she lays
a lot of nice eggs.

956
01:05:06,936 --> 01:05:08,904
Yeah, lots of them.

957
01:05:08,971 --> 01:05:13,738
You know something?
I've never seen a real duck egg.

958
01:05:13,809 --> 01:05:16,835
Do you suppose that I could
get her to lay one for me?

959
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:18,471
I don't know.

960
01:05:18,547 --> 01:05:22,847
- My dad can. He barks at her.
- He does? [stammers] He barks?

961
01:05:24,687 --> 01:05:28,248
Why don't I try that? You come
over here and hold her and I'll try it.

962
01:05:28,324 --> 01:05:29,814
Here we go.

963
01:05:32,194 --> 01:05:34,560
[Barks]

964
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:39,766
Anything happen back there? No.

965
01:05:42,004 --> 01:05:44,336
[Dog barks]

966
01:05:46,809 --> 01:05:48,640
[Ding]

967
01:05:50,513 --> 01:05:53,812
- Come home now, Jimmy.
- But look at the bike Mr. Hooper...

968
01:05:53,883 --> 01:05:56,852
Right now and bring Charlie. Hurry.

969
01:06:00,856 --> 01:06:02,949
And you, Mr. Hooper.

970
01:06:03,025 --> 01:06:07,257
Stealing your neighbor's eggs.
Aren't you ashamed?

971
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:12,460
[Sighs]

972
01:06:13,436 --> 01:06:16,234
That's right, Albert, he knows.

973
01:06:16,305 --> 01:06:18,739
No, he didn't get the egg, but...

974
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:21,675
Well, I can't keep the duck
locked up all the time,

975
01:06:21,744 --> 01:06:24,235
it's only human, you know.

976
01:06:24,313 --> 01:06:27,840
Yes. All right.

977
01:06:29,952 --> 01:06:32,216
Crisis, Fred.
Hooper's hip.

978
01:06:32,288 --> 01:06:35,587
I'll meet you at the house as quick
as I can sneak away from here, okay?

979
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:37,558
[Gottlieb] Dooley?

980
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:42,995
- [Squealing]
- Dooley! Dooley!

981
01:06:43,065 --> 01:06:47,502
What he has is this little duck.

982
01:06:49,038 --> 01:06:52,872
- Did you say duck?
- Yes. Duck.

983
01:06:53,943 --> 01:06:56,173
[Chuckling] I got it.

984
01:06:56,245 --> 01:07:00,773
Evidently some kind of
a new gangland code word.

985
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:04,946
No, just plain duck.
You know, "quack, quack."

986
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:07,683
And this duck lays gold eggs.

987
01:07:07,757 --> 01:07:10,885
It's true. I saw it happen.

988
01:07:11,994 --> 01:07:13,086
They bark at it.

989
01:07:15,131 --> 01:07:17,929
- Bark at it?
- Yeah, like a dog.

990
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,695
[Barks] They bark... Just like...

991
01:07:19,769 --> 01:07:23,671
And that causes the duck
to lay these... gold eggs.

992
01:07:30,046 --> 01:07:33,914
- I see.
- I did it myself.

993
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:36,479
You?

994
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:38,747
You laid a gold egg, Hoop?

995
01:07:38,821 --> 01:07:42,655
Oh, yeah, it wasn't easy...
No, I didn't.

996
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:45,819
I barked at it,
the duck, it laid the gold egg.

997
01:07:46,562 --> 01:07:49,360
Oh, yes, well...

998
01:07:49,432 --> 01:07:51,559
Very interesting.

999
01:07:55,471 --> 01:08:00,067
Look, why don't you stop by my office
sometime tomorrow and...

1000
01:08:00,142 --> 01:08:02,576
...you and me
have a little chat.

1001
01:08:03,579 --> 01:08:05,945
Chief, wait a minute,
I know it sounds...

1002
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:09,007
You confiscate the duck
and I'll prove it.

1003
01:08:13,756 --> 01:08:18,455
- How long you been with the Department?
- It was after Prohibition...

1004
01:08:18,527 --> 01:08:21,758
Chief, there may be
something to this.

1005
01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:24,493
I checked with a Dr. Gottlieb
at the University lab,

1006
01:08:24,567 --> 01:08:28,128
and he said something about Dooley
trying to make gold out of eggs.

1007
01:08:28,204 --> 01:08:31,173
I thought he was putting me on,
but with Hooper telling us...

1008
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:34,266
Aren't those nuggets all about
the same size as an egg yolk?

1009
01:08:34,343 --> 01:08:36,834
So... stop that.

1010
01:08:36,912 --> 01:08:39,608
It's all some fairy tale talk.

1011
01:08:39,682 --> 01:08:41,479
Sure, chief, but look at the facts.

1012
01:08:41,917 --> 01:08:43,680
[Phone rings]

1013
01:08:46,021 --> 01:08:51,152
Hooper here. Yes, Mr. Morgan,
we haven't struck yet, but it's a duck.

1014
01:08:51,227 --> 01:08:54,754
- Lays gold eggs. Duck.
- Let me have that.

1015
01:08:55,598 --> 01:08:58,829
Hi, Morg. Rutledge here.

1016
01:08:58,901 --> 01:09:00,596
Thank you, same to you.

1017
01:09:02,705 --> 01:09:06,004
There does seem to be a certain
degree of duck involvement here,

1018
01:09:06,075 --> 01:09:08,134
we don't know just...

1019
01:09:08,210 --> 01:09:11,236
No, duck. D-u...
Yeah.

1020
01:09:11,313 --> 01:09:13,679
Not a word's gotten out.

1021
01:09:13,749 --> 01:09:16,980
A duck?
Quack, quack.

1022
01:09:17,052 --> 01:09:20,681
Try to trade them for it.
Offer them all their gold.

1023
01:09:20,756 --> 01:09:24,624
Sell all our mines and buy up every
bloody duck from here to Cape Town.

1024
01:09:24,693 --> 01:09:27,685
Get the blueprint of U.s. Duck.

1025
01:09:27,763 --> 01:09:31,199
Make same thing.
Plastic. Half price.

1026
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:33,397
[Commotion]

1027
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:38,432
Now just let me
say this about that.

1028
01:09:38,507 --> 01:09:40,475
Get that duck.
Do you understand?

1029
01:09:40,543 --> 01:09:43,239
- [On phone] Get that duck.
- Bye-bye.

1030
01:09:46,582 --> 01:09:49,847
All right, men.
We're moving in.

1031
01:09:50,786 --> 01:09:52,310
Now, here's the strategy.

1032
01:10:03,499 --> 01:10:05,660
- Where's Charlie?
- Upstairs with Jimmy.

1033
01:10:05,734 --> 01:10:07,565
Good. Where's the egg?

1034
01:10:08,103 --> 01:10:11,732
That's what we want. We got to get rid
of the duck, too. Got any more of these?

1035
01:10:11,807 --> 01:10:14,901
- Give me the egg.
- What are you doing?

1036
01:10:14,977 --> 01:10:17,445
- I handle the eggs.
- Boys.

1037
01:10:17,513 --> 01:10:20,209
I know what you're trying to do,
and I'm the egg man.

1038
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:26,552
- Where are you going?
- Not now, Eunice, please.

1039
01:10:26,622 --> 01:10:29,750
- We're all adults.
- It's my egg, too.

1040
01:10:29,825 --> 01:10:32,988
Enough! Go upstairs
and get the duck.

1041
01:10:33,062 --> 01:10:37,328
Now wait just a minute.
I will decide what I am going to do.

1042
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:44,399
I'm going upstairs
and get the duck.

1043
01:10:48,410 --> 01:10:50,401
[Knocking on door]

1044
01:10:56,719 --> 01:10:59,586
Oh, hello, there, neighbor. I...

1045
01:10:59,655 --> 01:11:03,523
I thought you might like to meet my
colleagues down at the Treasury Dept.

1046
01:11:03,592 --> 01:11:06,060
- This is Mr. Rutledge, Mr. Smith...
- A pleasure.

1047
01:11:06,128 --> 01:11:08,153
Hope you can come back
when I'm not so busy.

1048
01:11:08,230 --> 01:11:09,697
Mr. Dooley.

1049
01:11:09,765 --> 01:11:10,823
Hold it.

1050
01:11:10,899 --> 01:11:14,357
Treasury men aren't entitled
to barge in without a search warrant.

1051
01:11:14,436 --> 01:11:16,427
Got it right here.

1052
01:11:17,873 --> 01:11:20,171
- There you are.
- [Hooper] Dooley.

1053
01:11:20,242 --> 01:11:22,767
Mr. Rutledge wants
to see your duck.

1054
01:11:23,979 --> 01:11:26,675
- What duck?
- Oh, come on now, Dooley.

1055
01:11:26,749 --> 01:11:28,239
You mean my little boy's pet?

1056
01:11:28,317 --> 01:11:32,651
Mr. Dooley, we have an eyewitness
who will attest to the fact

1057
01:11:32,721 --> 01:11:36,521
that you have
a duck that lays... gold eggs.

1058
01:11:36,592 --> 01:11:41,120
Gold eggs? What'd you do
a dumb thing like that for?

1059
01:11:41,196 --> 01:11:43,426
41,000 dollars worth of eggs,

1060
01:11:43,499 --> 01:11:46,525
and not one cent
of income tax has been declared.

1061
01:11:46,602 --> 01:11:48,900
Well, sir, this duck of yours
could very well be

1062
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:52,429
the most single valuable asset
in the United states today.

1063
01:11:52,508 --> 01:11:55,136
That duck is a natural resource.

1064
01:11:55,210 --> 01:11:57,337
Like Hoover Dam.

1065
01:11:57,413 --> 01:12:00,473
That duck's entitled to the
protection of the U.s. Government.

1066
01:12:00,549 --> 01:12:03,609
You have no proof that
my client's duck lays gold eggs.

1067
01:12:03,686 --> 01:12:08,282
I understand that the duck
will produce on command.

1068
01:12:08,357 --> 01:12:10,689
That's right.
I've done it myself.

1069
01:12:10,759 --> 01:12:13,922
- You bark at it.
- I'll get the duck.

1070
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:17,727
Wait a minute, you have your rights.
I'd like to confer with my client.

1071
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:20,530
- All right, you got 30 seconds.
- Come on.

1072
01:12:27,876 --> 01:12:29,867
- Are you out of your mind?
- Don't worry.

1073
01:12:29,945 --> 01:12:32,413
I'll bark in the wrong pitch
and she won't produce.

1074
01:12:32,481 --> 01:12:34,506
- You're sure she won't cross us up?
- No way.

1075
01:12:38,087 --> 01:12:39,952
I'll get the duck.

1076
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:43,788
I'd better, he might not give it to you.
He's not too crazy about you these days.

1077
01:12:43,859 --> 01:12:46,487
- Don't let her out of your sight.
- [Katie] No.

1078
01:12:46,562 --> 01:12:49,395
I am not going upstairs
with some strange man.

1079
01:12:49,465 --> 01:12:51,626
It's okay.

1080
01:13:04,813 --> 01:13:07,509
- [Katie] He's gone.
- The duck?

1081
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:09,949
- No, Jimmy.
- He went out the window with the duck.

1082
01:13:10,018 --> 01:13:12,043
- [Albert] They're gone?
- You tricked us.

1083
01:13:12,121 --> 01:13:14,612
- Shut up.
- Don't just everybody stand there.

1084
01:13:14,690 --> 01:13:17,352
- Please go out and find him.
- All right, I'll handle it.

1085
01:13:17,426 --> 01:13:20,190
Beckert, smith, Forbes,
outside, deploy, cover the area.

1086
01:13:20,262 --> 01:13:22,492
- Hooper, stick with me.
- Right behind you.

1087
01:13:22,564 --> 01:13:24,862
Katie's right,
we have to find that duck.

1088
01:13:24,933 --> 01:13:27,333
Not the duck, Fred. My son.

1089
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:29,371
Mrs. Hooper. Mrs. Hooper.

1090
01:13:29,438 --> 01:13:31,770
Did you see the Dooley kid
run out of his house?

1091
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:33,740
- With the duck?
- I sure did.

1092
01:13:33,809 --> 01:13:36,300
He got a bicycle out of
our garage and took off.

1093
01:13:36,378 --> 01:13:38,505
- Which way did he go?
- That way.

1094
01:13:39,882 --> 01:13:42,214
Forbes, come on, let's go.

1095
01:13:42,484 --> 01:13:45,112
Why don't you watch
what you're doing?

1096
01:13:47,489 --> 01:13:51,050
Poor Jimmy. If we'd never
gotten that darn duck.

1097
01:13:51,126 --> 01:13:52,855
[Albert] We'll find him.

1098
01:13:59,968 --> 01:14:01,799
[Tires screech]

1099
01:14:20,556 --> 01:14:22,148
There's his bike.
Come on.

1100
01:14:26,728 --> 01:14:27,922
Look.

1101
01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:31,129
Turn around, let's go.

1102
01:15:00,963 --> 01:15:02,487
[Hooper] There, chief.

1103
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:07,066
[Tires screech]

1104
01:15:16,478 --> 01:15:18,469
Search that truck.

1105
01:15:22,117 --> 01:15:24,847
- [Hooper] Not in there. Not in there.
- [Rutledge] Huh?

1106
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:28,947
Hey! What are you bums
doing to my truck?

1107
01:15:29,024 --> 01:15:32,926
Sorry, sir. This is U.s. Official
United states government business.

1108
01:15:32,995 --> 01:15:35,190
We know you got
a duck here somewhere.

1109
01:15:35,264 --> 01:15:36,595
A duck?

1110
01:15:37,065 --> 01:15:41,229
Hey. I know.
This is Candid Camera, right?

1111
01:15:43,305 --> 01:15:46,502
Where is it? Eh? Where is it?

1112
01:16:01,256 --> 01:16:03,156
Okay, Mack. Move.

1113
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:14,495
[Rutledge] Let's check the alley.
There's no sign of him around here.

1114
01:16:18,607 --> 01:16:20,939
- There they are.
- Wait for us.

1115
01:16:27,649 --> 01:16:29,207
Come on, boy.

1116
01:16:35,324 --> 01:16:37,121
Charlie!

1117
01:16:38,293 --> 01:16:40,022
[Jimmy] Charlie!

1118
01:16:53,208 --> 01:16:56,109
- [Woman] What are you doing?
- Charlie!

1119
01:16:56,178 --> 01:16:58,169
Stop it, come here.

1120
01:16:58,246 --> 01:17:01,875
[Brakes screech, crash]

1121
01:17:03,552 --> 01:17:06,043
I saw. The truck swerved
to miss the duck.

1122
01:17:06,121 --> 01:17:07,782
Hey! It's our old buddy, Jimmy.

1123
01:17:07,856 --> 01:17:09,653
[Man] What did you want?
Hit the duck?

1124
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:14,793
- Come on.
- Don't let them get Charlie.

1125
01:17:14,863 --> 01:17:18,060
- Who's after him, man?
- Everybody. Even the government.

1126
01:17:18,133 --> 01:17:20,328
- The government...
- Come on, haul it.

1127
01:17:20,402 --> 01:17:23,963
- All right, cool it.
- Come on, Charlie. You're mine.

1128
01:17:26,375 --> 01:17:28,935
There they are.
The Wadlows have him.

1129
01:17:32,547 --> 01:17:35,914
Never mind that. Get up here
and move that car out of the way.

1130
01:17:40,055 --> 01:17:42,148
I said move it.

1131
01:17:45,827 --> 01:17:47,454
[Screaming]

1132
01:17:57,072 --> 01:17:58,664
- Watch out.
- Hey!

1133
01:18:12,287 --> 01:18:16,621
Wait a minute. They're always ready,
and boy do we need them.

1134
01:18:16,692 --> 01:18:17,920
[Fred] Get in.

1135
01:18:17,993 --> 01:18:19,961
Should we leave a note for somebody?

1136
01:18:20,028 --> 01:18:21,518
Get in, get in, get in!

1137
01:18:44,653 --> 01:18:47,554
Albert! Jump on.

1138
01:19:08,343 --> 01:19:10,743
Stop this thing.
He's gonna be killed up there.

1139
01:19:10,812 --> 01:19:14,646
- Try and lower him.
- How do you work this crazy thing?

1140
01:19:23,859 --> 01:19:25,417
Hey, Fred!

1141
01:19:25,494 --> 01:19:27,962
[Albert] Turn right at the next corner.

1142
01:19:40,308 --> 01:19:42,970
Hey, Fred. Watch it!

1143
01:19:43,044 --> 01:19:44,841
That was a red light.

1144
01:19:46,882 --> 01:19:49,282
[Orlo] Hey, look what they're
chasing us with.

1145
01:19:51,787 --> 01:19:54,984
I sure gotta hand it to your old man.
He's something else.

1146
01:20:00,462 --> 01:20:02,327
For crying out loud!

1147
01:20:02,397 --> 01:20:04,888
- Take it easy.
- Hang on, Albert.

1148
01:20:12,908 --> 01:20:15,172
Fred. Fred!

1149
01:20:15,243 --> 01:20:17,336
What are you trying to do, kill me?

1150
01:20:37,232 --> 01:20:39,257
Stop. We're gonna decaptivate him.

1151
01:20:39,334 --> 01:20:41,268
[Brakes screech]

1152
01:20:43,004 --> 01:20:45,029
What are you trying to pull now?

1153
01:20:45,106 --> 01:20:48,200
What do you think?
I'm waiting for a streetcar...

1154
01:20:49,878 --> 01:20:51,641
Go, Forbes, after him.

1155
01:21:05,327 --> 01:21:06,794
Here we go.

1156
01:21:06,862 --> 01:21:08,853
[Sirens wail]

1157
01:21:20,742 --> 01:21:23,677
Get around that fool truck
and we got them.

1158
01:21:27,949 --> 01:21:29,780
Come on, pass him, will you?

1159
01:21:48,536 --> 01:21:50,868
Your dad's cool,
but he sure is a show-off.

1160
01:21:52,741 --> 01:21:55,437
[Horn blaring]

1161
01:22:31,546 --> 01:22:34,845
Hold it. Hold it.
You got to have a ticket.

1162
01:22:42,824 --> 01:22:46,021
Swing back to that garage,
we got them now.

1163
01:22:52,901 --> 01:22:54,926
[Man] I didn't do it!

1164
01:22:56,771 --> 01:22:59,865
You can't make a U-turn here, stupid.
Who do you think you are?

1165
01:22:59,941 --> 01:23:01,806
[Everyone shouting]

1166
01:23:03,144 --> 01:23:06,136
Thank you. Move along, folks.
Break it up.

1167
01:23:06,214 --> 01:23:08,614
- Official government business.
- Government?

1168
01:23:08,683 --> 01:23:11,015
No wonder you got
everything all loused up.

1169
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:20,825
The boys are in the parking garage.

1170
01:23:33,575 --> 01:23:35,805
Wait, you can't
bring this thing in here.

1171
01:23:35,877 --> 01:23:38,345
- My son is in here.
- I don't care who's in here.

1172
01:23:38,413 --> 01:23:40,244
[Attendant] Get this heap out of here.

1173
01:23:40,315 --> 01:23:43,580
Will you please take my money?
I'm in an awful hurry.

1174
01:23:43,651 --> 01:23:47,109
Will you get this out of here now!
Yeah.

1175
01:23:58,900 --> 01:24:00,458
Hey, over there.

1176
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:06,007
- Come on.
- Come on.

1177
01:24:06,074 --> 01:24:08,201
[Arvin] Come on, move it!

1178
01:24:13,014 --> 01:24:15,005
[Arvin] Over you go, Jimmy.

1179
01:24:33,101 --> 01:24:34,625
[Orlo] Arvin, a ladder.

1180
01:24:41,776 --> 01:24:43,471
[Albert] Jimmy!

1181
01:24:48,116 --> 01:24:50,311
[Arvin] Okay, over you go.

1182
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:55,112
- Be brave, pal. Attaboy.
- [Albert] Where are you?

1183
01:25:03,364 --> 01:25:06,094
- Easy does it.
- Easy, Jim. Come on.

1184
01:25:06,167 --> 01:25:08,829
[Arvin] Okay. There you go.

1185
01:25:13,475 --> 01:25:16,000
[Quacking]

1186
01:25:19,948 --> 01:25:21,438
[Jimmy] Help.

1187
01:25:24,185 --> 01:25:26,915
[Orlo] Hang on, we'll get you.
Just hang on.

1188
01:25:26,988 --> 01:25:30,082
- [Orlo] We'll find something.
- Jimmy.

1189
01:25:30,158 --> 01:25:31,420
Jimmy.

1190
01:25:32,260 --> 01:25:34,251
Don't move. Don't move, son.

1191
01:25:45,406 --> 01:25:48,637
- Jimmy.
- Go away, Daddy.

1192
01:25:48,710 --> 01:25:53,010
- Give me your hand.
- You just want Charlie, that's all.

1193
01:25:53,081 --> 01:25:55,345
Jimmy, put your hand in mine.

1194
01:25:55,416 --> 01:25:57,714
Just go away, Daddy.

1195
01:25:58,386 --> 01:26:00,854
- [Cracking]
- Daddy, help!

1196
01:26:06,327 --> 01:26:08,352
Help!

1197
01:26:25,580 --> 01:26:27,070
Oh, Jimmy.

1198
01:26:27,949 --> 01:26:29,644
Oh, my son.

1199
01:26:37,992 --> 01:26:40,187
- [Quacking]
- [Rutledge] Hooper.

1200
01:26:42,530 --> 01:26:47,229
Daddy, don't let them take Charlie.
Don't let 'em.

1201
01:26:48,169 --> 01:26:51,002
Sorry, son, there's nothing
I can do about that now.

1202
01:26:51,072 --> 01:26:55,065
- [Quacking]
- Charlie, Charlie, Charlie!

1203
01:26:55,944 --> 01:26:58,276
I'm sorry, sonny. I'm sorry.

1204
01:26:58,346 --> 01:27:02,248
We've got to put Charlie under
protective custody for his own good.

1205
01:27:02,317 --> 01:27:05,514
Let's go home.
I'll explain it all to you later.

1206
01:27:07,855 --> 01:27:09,846
- So long, gentlemen.
- No.

1207
01:27:09,924 --> 01:27:12,518
You're not going home,
you're coming along with us.

1208
01:27:12,594 --> 01:27:14,892
- You're under arrest.
- Arrest?

1209
01:27:14,963 --> 01:27:18,524
Suspicion of violation
of federal gold regulations.

1210
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:22,468
- He didn't mean to.
- Sorry. Come on, Dooley.

1211
01:27:25,940 --> 01:27:28,067
Well, at least you're lucky, old boy.

1212
01:27:29,010 --> 01:27:32,571
Lucky?
My son disowned me, I've lost a fortune

1213
01:27:32,647 --> 01:27:35,081
and I've been arrested
by the federal government.

1214
01:27:35,149 --> 01:27:39,176
Right. But you've got a darn good
lawyer to handle your case.

1215
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:42,256
Thanks, Fred.

1216
01:27:47,228 --> 01:27:49,253
[Sirens wail]

1217
01:28:08,816 --> 01:28:10,374
[Crowd shouting]

1218
01:28:10,451 --> 01:28:12,009
[Man] Where are the gold eggs?

1219
01:28:16,090 --> 01:28:17,580
[Man] Right on time, Charlie.

1220
01:28:17,659 --> 01:28:21,254
- [Man] What's that duck really worth?
- Will the duck testify?

1221
01:28:21,329 --> 01:28:24,662
Sorry, you can't get
into the trial. That's regulations.

1222
01:28:24,732 --> 01:28:27,633
We cover riot cases, rapes and spies,
but a rich duck? Oh, no.

1223
01:28:27,702 --> 01:28:29,294
Sorry, gentlemen.

1224
01:28:34,309 --> 01:28:39,269
[Lawyer] Mr. Hooper, did you actually
witness the duck lay a golden egg?

1225
01:28:39,347 --> 01:28:40,336
[Hooper] Yes, sir.

1226
01:28:40,415 --> 01:28:44,408
- Did you make it perform this feat?
- I did, indeed.

1227
01:28:44,485 --> 01:28:47,147
[Lawyer] Would you
demonstrate it for us?

1228
01:28:47,221 --> 01:28:49,018
I'd be happy to.

1229
01:29:01,736 --> 01:29:03,533
[Barking]

1230
01:29:10,111 --> 01:29:12,045
It's the wrong pitch, isn't it?

1231
01:29:30,798 --> 01:29:33,266
Your Honor,
he's not doing it right.

1232
01:29:33,334 --> 01:29:35,768
- Sit down.
- I'd like to get this out in the open.

1233
01:29:35,837 --> 01:29:39,830
If that duck can lay gold eggs,
then we should establish that.

1234
01:29:39,907 --> 01:29:42,842
If I've done anything wrong,
I'll accept the consequences.

1235
01:29:42,910 --> 01:29:46,903
- You're out of your mind.
- If we lose the duck, so be it.

1236
01:29:46,981 --> 01:29:49,973
It's just that now I know
that there are things...

1237
01:29:51,552 --> 01:29:53,577
...a darn sight
more valuable to me.

1238
01:30:00,328 --> 01:30:01,886
Excuse me.

1239
01:30:05,333 --> 01:30:07,324
One more time, Charlie.

1240
01:30:07,402 --> 01:30:09,768
[Barking]

1241
01:30:11,839 --> 01:30:13,864
[Ding]

1242
01:30:13,941 --> 01:30:18,105
There it is. There's the evidence.
Break that open and look inside of it.

1243
01:30:18,179 --> 01:30:20,704
You're gonna get it now.
Wait till it...

1244
01:30:29,490 --> 01:30:31,253
[crowd muttering]

1245
01:30:35,496 --> 01:30:39,455
It's run out. Finished.

1246
01:30:40,968 --> 01:30:44,369
[Judge bangs gavel] Case dismissed
because of lack of evidence.

1247
01:30:44,439 --> 01:30:48,273
But Your Honor, the defendant has
40,000 dollars in various banks.

1248
01:30:48,342 --> 01:30:50,003
[Judge] Well, good for him.

1249
01:30:50,077 --> 01:30:53,342
Since when are we against
the accumulation of a few dollars,

1250
01:30:53,414 --> 01:30:56,474
as a result of individual initiative?

1251
01:30:56,551 --> 01:30:59,611
This country was built on
enterprise and ingenuity.

1252
01:30:59,687 --> 01:31:02,019
Let's don't lose that.

1253
01:31:02,089 --> 01:31:05,525
Only bad thing is, he won't be able
to keep more of the money,

1254
01:31:05,593 --> 01:31:08,153
after he pays his income tax on it.

1255
01:31:11,766 --> 01:31:16,169
You know, for a worthless creature,
you sure have caused a lot of trouble.

1256
01:31:17,538 --> 01:31:20,006
- Here you are, Professor.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

1257
01:31:20,074 --> 01:31:25,011
But, you're wrong about this duck
being worthless, it has great value.

1258
01:31:25,079 --> 01:31:28,981
It was just that I was a little
confused about what that value was.

1259
01:31:44,365 --> 01:31:45,559
Really?

1260
01:31:47,201 --> 01:31:51,001
- Forever?
- Really forever, pal.

1261
01:31:52,907 --> 01:31:54,704
[Judge] One word of caution, son.

1262
01:31:54,775 --> 01:31:57,744
If it ever lays another gold egg...

1263
01:31:58,513 --> 01:32:00,879
...bury it. Quick.

1264
01:32:09,023 --> 01:32:11,218
[Crowd cheering, duck quacking]
