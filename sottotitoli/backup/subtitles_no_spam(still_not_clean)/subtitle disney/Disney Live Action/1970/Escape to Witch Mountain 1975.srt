1
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,759
Well, here we are!

2
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,595
You're Tony and you're Tia.

3
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,722
- Ma'am.
- Hello, Mrs. Grindley.

4
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,807
Oh, such fine-looking children.

5
00:03:19,907 --> 00:03:22,185
I know you're anxious to see your rooms,

6
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:24,520
but first we have some forms to fill out.

7
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,690
Then we'll join the others
for dinner, all right?

8
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:31,169
Tia, what a pretty case!

9
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,726
Well.

10
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:46,125
It ain't nothing
writing out those entry forms.

11
00:03:46,225 --> 00:03:49,003
Wait'll she lays one of those
enlightened punishments on you.

12
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:53,299
"After you watch the 5:00 news,
you can write a 500-word composition."

13
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,491
Brother!

14
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:59,263
Tony, what should I put after sports?

15
00:03:59,363 --> 00:04:02,663
Hmm, put "spectator."

16
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:05,895
Dumb pen's out of ink.

17
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:09,044
I'm finished. You can use mine.

18
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:14,634
Hey, I lost one just like this
when I was coming in this barn.

19
00:04:15,963 --> 00:04:20,013
- Tia's had that since Christmas.
- Sure she has.

20
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:23,684
Give it back!

21
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,437
Take it.

22
00:04:29,685 --> 00:04:34,424
Now, children,
that wasn't so difficult, was it?

23
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,175
No, ma'am.

24
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:37,927
Now, then.

25
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:40,847
Truck, I want you to wait for me
in my office.

26
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,325
We'll read this together.

27
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:53,673
I keep forgetting
what it feels like to sit down.

28
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:57,697
Now then, I know how
both of you must feel.

29
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:01,284
Your foster parents
are the only parents you remember.

30
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:05,705
Now that they've passed away,
you're just a little bit scared.

31
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,915
We loved them very much.

32
00:05:08,015 --> 00:05:10,042
Yes, ma'am, we miss them.

33
00:05:10,142 --> 00:05:14,363
You only remember
your adoptive name? Malone?

34
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:20,237
Tia was around three and I was five
when the Malones adopted us.

35
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:26,952
Did either of you ever receive
a birthday card from a relative?

36
00:05:27,743 --> 00:05:30,563
Or perhaps a phone call at Christmas?

37
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:33,149
Something you may have forgotten.

38
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:36,611
Oft times the most trivial thing
is important.

39
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:37,803
Tia?

40
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:42,593
What is it, dear? You look as though
you're remembering something.

41
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:46,430
No. No, Mrs. Grindley. I'm sorry.

42
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:51,601
Why, there's nothing
to be sorry about, dear.

43
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,965
You're out, Truck.

44
00:06:26,802 --> 00:06:30,648
Nobody can jump that high, Malone.
You stood on something.

45
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,241
- Great catch!
- How'd you do it anyhow?

46
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:51,710
You're just trying to rip me off.
I was safe at third.

47
00:06:51,952 --> 00:06:56,708
Safe. There's something funny about
this. I'm gonna teach you a lesson.

48
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,131
Tony...

49
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:16,148
Cut it out, all right?

50
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,121
Ow!

51
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,449
Tony, why'd you do that?

52
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:49,644
You don't think we're gonna
get away with it, do you?

53
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,729
You see?

54
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:08,679
Tony, you promised me and I promised you.

55
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:13,809
We wouldn't... You know,
do the kind of stuff you did with Truck.

56
00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:18,314
You remember how it used to be,
when we thought it was all funny.

57
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:20,274
Like a game.

58
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:25,346
All the other kids thought we were
some kind of freaks or witches.

59
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,556
I know, Tia.

60
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:31,844
We lost all of our friends
until we quit doing all the spooky stuff.

61
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:34,330
You should've let Truck beat up on you.

62
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:38,501
Are you kidding? He's got five inches
and 50 pounds on me.

63
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:41,605
Then you should've made it
look like he was winning.

64
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,274
I suppose.

65
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:46,942
Tony?

66
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:50,075
Do you hear the dogs?

67
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,539
No. How far?

68
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:59,797
Oh, about 20 miles.

69
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:03,192
Big dogs, six or seven.

70
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:07,801
Yeah. I can hear them now.

71
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:15,772
That's awful far. Even for us.
Why are we hearing them, Tony?

72
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:22,066
I think it means that
we're gonna see 'em someday.

73
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:45,234
If the bus is any later, Mrs. Grindley,
we'll miss the beginning of the picture.

74
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:48,713
- Yeah.
- I'll see what's keeping them.

75
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:51,907
All right, Truck.

76
00:09:52,007 --> 00:09:54,368
You guys, wanna see something really neat?

77
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:56,470
That's my star case, Truck.

78
00:09:57,012 --> 00:09:58,480
And you're his sister.

79
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,917
Tony, please, not another fight.

80
00:10:02,017 --> 00:10:05,863
It's your star case, Tia.
He might smash it.

81
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,675
Give it back to Tia now.

82
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,178
I'll fight you with one hand.

83
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,372
I'll fight you with none.

84
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,265
Come on!

85
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:22,254
The bus is here.

86
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,394
Nice going, Winkie.

87
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:45,903
Hey, Tony and Tia, come on!
What's taking you? Come on!

88
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:48,363
Hurry up!

89
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:08,084
Tony, across the street!

90
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:14,990
Big car? What about it?

91
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:18,160
Something's going to happen to it.

92
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:22,356
There's a man.
He mustn't get into that car.

93
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:23,724
There he is!

94
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:29,188
Come on!

95
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,529
Please, sir, don't get in that car.

96
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:38,514
It's no joke, sir.

97
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:41,684
See, my sister gets these feelings.

98
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:45,038
- So, you mustn't get in the car.
- Please, sir.

99
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:49,984
Children, you know the rules
about leaving the group.

100
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:52,653
No. I'm terribly sorry, sir.

101
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:55,573
- That's all right.
- Excuse us, please.

102
00:12:02,846 --> 00:12:06,000
I've changed my mind.
I'd like to take a walk.

103
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,650
- Pick me up by the park.
- Yes, sir.

104
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:28,168
- Are you all right?
- Yes, sir.

105
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,252
The moon is moving into Aries.

106
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:53,505
Friday it will near
the middle of the transit.

107
00:12:53,605 --> 00:12:56,800
The bottom line, Mr. Michael-John.

108
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:00,054
The bottom line, Mr. Bolt,

109
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:06,101
shows considerable indications
of some advance toward your goals.

110
00:13:06,201 --> 00:13:08,854
What about the house guru?
Do you concur, Ali?

111
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:12,399
There are profound vibrations, Mr. Bolt.

112
00:13:12,499 --> 00:13:14,485
Are there indeed?

113
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:18,447
Vibrations. My moon in Aries.

114
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:23,619
Mysterious words and phrases have
not added one red cent to my fortune.

115
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:28,590
Wealth, gentlemen, is like flesh.
It has to be nurtured and coddled.

116
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,404
Ah, Mr. Deranian.

117
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:38,425
I'm sorry, Mr. Bolt,
but when you've heard my report,

118
00:13:38,525 --> 00:13:41,053
I think you'll understand.

119
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:44,202
I have found what you're looking for.

120
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,545
Wait here a minute.

121
00:14:30,577 --> 00:14:32,771
I haven't had a chance to thank you.

122
00:14:32,871 --> 00:14:36,734
- Was the man in front all right?
- The chauffeur, yes. He's fine.

123
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:40,304
But then you knew he would be or you'd
have had him get out of the car, too.

124
00:14:42,005 --> 00:14:45,868
I suppose this sort of thing
happens to you all the time,

125
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,911
hmm, young lady?

126
00:14:48,011 --> 00:14:50,685
Knowing about things
before they really happen?

127
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,646
The lunch bell. We have to go.

128
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:58,943
Excuse me.

129
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:03,385
Those two children that just left.
I've been trying to think of their names.

130
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:07,831
Tony Malone and his sister, Tia.
A couple of weirdos.

131
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:46,529
Suppose somebody else had walked in?

132
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:56,105
Everybody knocks. Pine Woods' rules.

133
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,832
Look.

134
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:04,154
Must've happened when Winkie
knocked it out of Truck's hands.

135
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:05,722
Can you fix it?

136
00:16:09,676 --> 00:16:11,599
It's a map, isn't it?

137
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:14,164
"Stony Creek"?

138
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:16,016
"Misty Valley"?

139
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,227
It's funny, Tia,

140
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,564
but every once and a while
you get that look on your face.

141
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,899
Like you're remembering something.

142
00:16:40,999 --> 00:16:45,345
I kind of do, but then I forget again.

143
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:52,308
It's not someplace big,
like a state or a country.

144
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:57,566
But more like a road map.
I just don't know where.

145
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:01,896
When I can figure out
where this place is, we'll go there.

146
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:08,302
Tony, what were you drawing?

147
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:11,089
It's the place where those dogs are.

148
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,057
They're barking now.

149
00:17:14,157 --> 00:17:17,627
Yeah, I know. I was listening to them
before you butted in.

150
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:19,646
I began to visualize this castle...

151
00:17:19,746 --> 00:17:24,026
Tony, you can only visualize places
we know something about.

152
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,965
Or places we're gonna be at.

153
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:33,761
I must've been drawing
someplace we're going to.

154
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,498
Soon, Tony.

155
00:17:38,598 --> 00:17:41,727
We're going there soon, and I'm afraid.

156
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:09,071
Since the Malones lived
in a very small village,

157
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:12,425
I had little difficulty
finding people who knew the children.

158
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:16,513
These insights,
these sixth-sense incidents...

159
00:18:17,512 --> 00:18:21,583
The postman, the schoolteacher,
the woman who lost her parakeet,

160
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:24,711
how do I know these aren't
the result of your desperation?

161
00:18:24,811 --> 00:18:27,130
Figments of your very fine imagination?

162
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:29,608
I have sworn affidavits.

163
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:34,596
People lie very easily. The very
young can deceive the very wise.

164
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:36,744
I'm not lying.

165
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:41,979
If I'm in any way disappointed
in this Tony and Tia,

166
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,564
you are through here, Deranian.

167
00:18:44,664 --> 00:18:48,610
Yes. I understand.

168
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,113
Then bring them here.

169
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:54,241
You say they have no family.
Well, now they do.

170
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:56,076
You are their family, Deranian.

171
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:58,178
You are their uncle, do you understand?

172
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,789
Perfectly.

173
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:05,294
Alter records. Forge documents.
Provide proper papers.

174
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:10,132
Whatever it takes. I will back you
with every means at my disposal.

175
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,735
Just bring me the children.

176
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,179
I think there's no question,

177
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:19,641
considering these documents
your uncle has produced,

178
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:22,060
that he has custody of you.

179
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,813
The judge signed those papers just today.

180
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:26,148
Mr. Deranian...

181
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:29,776
Uncle Lucas, Tony. Better get used to it.

182
00:19:29,876 --> 00:19:34,723
Uncle Lucas, did you tell Mrs. Grindley
about the first time we ever saw you?

183
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,658
Yes, he did.

184
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:39,995
The day the tow truck
ran into your uncle's car.

185
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:42,664
That was a lucky day for all of us.

186
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:45,709
You see, Tia, you bear such a remarkable

187
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:48,253
resemblance to Mr. Deranian's sister

188
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:52,028
that he's convinced
you both are her children.

189
00:19:52,607 --> 00:19:57,784
My sister, your mother,
died six years ago.

190
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:01,224
Now, if you have any doubts,

191
00:20:01,324 --> 00:20:03,977
I'd be happy to show you these documents

192
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:06,079
that prove he is your Uncle Lucas.

193
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:08,857
I won't have to leave Winkie, will I?

194
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:12,302
He's very smart and
he knows how to deal with dogs.

195
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:14,296
Did I mention dogs?

196
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:21,495
Well, thank you very much, Mrs. Grindley.

197
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,997
I'll see you out, Mr. Deranian.

198
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:26,646
Children, don't forget your coats.

199
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:32,214
Do you have any feelings
about this Mr. Deranian?

200
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:35,050
Only that he isn't our uncle.

201
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,677
Must we leave, Tony?

202
00:20:37,777 --> 00:20:40,555
That's what these papers mean.

203
00:20:40,655 --> 00:20:43,158
We haven't got a choice.

204
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:08,726
It's all right, Lorko,
I'm just bringing through the children.

205
00:21:20,695 --> 00:21:23,890
I'm sorry, but I'm allergic to cats.

206
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:25,867
Let us through.

207
00:21:46,304 --> 00:21:48,056
Those are the dogs we heard.

208
00:21:55,730 --> 00:22:00,201
There's the mansion.
Just the way you drew it, Tony.

209
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:11,980
Uncle Lucas, what's "Xzanthus"?

210
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,649
It's "Xanthus," Tony.

211
00:22:14,749 --> 00:22:17,652
Mr. Bolt calls his house "Xanthus."

212
00:22:17,752 --> 00:22:19,654
Who's Mr. Bolt?

213
00:22:19,754 --> 00:22:22,007
Mr. Bolt is my employer.

214
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,681
And your host.

215
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:31,333
I have spacious apartments here.

216
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:34,002
And thanks to Mr. Bolt's generosity,

217
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:37,777
they've been enlarged and redecorated
to accommodate the two of you.

218
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:48,917
So, this is your long lost family?

219
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:52,145
You have a very beautiful niece, Deranian.

220
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:54,856
And a most attractive nephew.

221
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:57,755
You're Tony and you are Tia.

222
00:23:01,796 --> 00:23:03,264
Here.

223
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:08,870
Our favorite flavors,
vanilla and strawberry.

224
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,289
- Thank you!
- You're welcome.

225
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:12,999
After that long drive,

226
00:23:13,099 --> 00:23:17,570
I'm sure you youngsters would like
to see your quarters. Come with me.

227
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:34,830
Wow! It's beautiful.

228
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:41,194
- Isn't it cute?
- I must be dreaming.

229
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:42,967
Tony, look at that!

230
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:49,849
Hey, look!

231
00:23:50,845 --> 00:23:52,222
Oh, wow!

232
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:59,754
Look at these dolls and stuffed animals.

233
00:23:59,854 --> 00:24:01,197
Whoa!

234
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:05,698
Hey, Tony!

235
00:24:11,866 --> 00:24:14,644
- When all this is completed...
- There's more?

236
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:16,271
Oh, yes!

237
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:19,816
We haven't had time yet to install
the carousel or the gymnasium.

238
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:22,527
The tennis court's being resurfaced.

239
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:25,597
You can start your riding lessons
first thing in the morning.

240
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:27,657
Oh, wow!

241
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:30,806
- We love horses.
- Oh, I forgot!

242
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,978
Winkie's private quarters.

243
00:24:47,902 --> 00:24:50,221
Look, I think he likes it.

244
00:24:52,323 --> 00:24:53,600
They're really great.

245
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,644
Of course, you still have your schoolwork.

246
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,963
Your tutors arrive the first of the week.

247
00:24:58,288 --> 00:25:01,383
Mr. Bolt, where are the others?

248
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:04,590
- Other kids?
- Neighbors, I mean.

249
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:07,030
There are no neighbors.

250
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,783
Look out the window, go on.

251
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:11,885
Look as far as you can see.

252
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:24,573
Mr. Bolt owns everything in sight.

253
00:25:29,068 --> 00:25:30,615
Well, I can see the sky.

254
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:40,689
I saddle him myself
because this is your first time out,

255
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:41,940
but one thing to remember,

256
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,151
always mount a horse
on his left side because...

257
00:25:45,251 --> 00:25:48,613
Tia? You better pay attention
or you'll be sorry.

258
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:52,409
Mr. Duncan, that horse over there.

259
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:54,244
That's old Thunderhead.
He's never been broke.

260
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:56,642
I don't envy the cowboy who'll try it.

261
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,374
I know it should be "ladies first,"

262
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:02,210
but I think if you show Tia
how easy it is...

263
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:05,655
A little filly the size of your sister,
sometimes they get scared.

264
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,830
Thunderhead, that's not nice.

265
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,433
My name's Tia.

266
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:18,727
And I want to be your friend.

267
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,374
All right, Thunderhead?

268
00:26:23,998 --> 00:26:26,276
Tia! Stay away from him!

269
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:28,527
Hold on, now!

270
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:37,725
Good boy.

271
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:54,955
You know, I've never seen
anything like this in all my life.

272
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:26,503
Tia! Come here.

273
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:41,684
Hey, Tony, why don't you try it
without your harmonica?

274
00:27:41,784 --> 00:27:43,286
I forget how.

275
00:27:44,203 --> 00:27:47,482
Come to think of it,
you can do a lot of things I can't.

276
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:53,154
Like working locks and the way you can
talk to me without moving your mouth.

277
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:55,598
Maybe it's because you're a girl.

278
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:11,668
That's the most incredible thing
I've ever seen.

279
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:14,003
Thank you, but we've a long way to go.

280
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:16,130
I'm having more hidden cameras installed

281
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:19,217
and as soon as I have enough evidence,

282
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:21,719
I'm going to show the tapes
to the children.

283
00:30:21,819 --> 00:30:24,847
Good. If that doesn't put them on my team,

284
00:30:24,947 --> 00:30:28,622
then we'll have to resort
to cruder methods of persuasion.

285
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:41,673
Tia?

286
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,393
Tia?

287
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:52,771
Tia, what's the matter?

288
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:57,839
Oh, everything and nothing.

289
00:30:57,939 --> 00:31:00,800
I mean, maybe it's because we've gotten

290
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,011
everything we've ever wanted.

291
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:05,004
More, even.

292
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:08,525
It's... I don't know.

293
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,731
It just doesn't leave us
anything to wish for. Is that it?

294
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:16,816
I think so.

295
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:21,797
Tony, we've got to get out of here
before it's too late, please.

296
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:27,035
- What do you see?
- Mr. Bolt, and he's mean.

297
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,412
He's never gonna let us go, Tony.

298
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:32,015
You're not always right
about things like this.

299
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,313
I think this time...

300
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,528
This time...

301
00:31:41,141 --> 00:31:43,026
You're right.

302
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:54,645
I've enjoyed this.

303
00:31:54,745 --> 00:31:57,065
You should ask Uncle Lucas to arrange it

304
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:59,025
so you can dine with me more often.

305
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,693
Thank you, Mr. Bolt.

306
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:03,946
We had some fine,
stimulating conversation.

307
00:32:04,046 --> 00:32:05,514
However...

308
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:09,619
Let us dispense with the kid gloves,
and acknowledge the fact

309
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:12,288
that we're dealing
with two remarkable children.

310
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:14,916
Mr. Bolt, I really don't think you...

311
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:17,418
It doesn't matter
what you think, Deranian.

312
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:19,504
If these youngsters are psychic,

313
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:22,256
it's obvious they've begun
to see through us by now.

314
00:32:22,356 --> 00:32:26,761
- Don't lay all...
- You have power. I've seen it.

315
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:30,765
Now, I don't mean to ridicule
those gifts of yours, as others might.

316
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:33,709
I revere them. Do you believe that?

317
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:36,537
What power do you mean, Mr. Bolt?

318
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:39,982
He knows. He knows all about us.

319
00:32:40,082 --> 00:32:42,777
I don't think we know
what you mean, Mr. Bolt.

320
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:46,114
What you did with Thunderhead
and the marionettes.

321
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:49,367
And the dozens of things
I've seen on my TV console.

322
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:52,662
I want to know. I want to be able
to understand these powers.

323
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:55,456
But that's impossible without your help.

324
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:58,150
You can make it possible.

325
00:32:58,809 --> 00:33:00,795
You could walk across a field

326
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:03,756
and tell where there's oil far beneath it.

327
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:06,968
You could foresee a revolution.
A natural disaster.

328
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:12,807
Please, Mr. Bolt, you're too excited.
You're going to make yourself sick.

329
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:15,080
You should go right to bed, sir.

330
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:19,422
Yes.

331
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:23,005
Yes, I will.

332
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:26,070
Anything.

333
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:31,597
Anything in this world you ask me for,
I'll bring you. Just never leave me.

334
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:35,079
Not another word. Into bed.

335
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:36,622
Uncle Lucas, you look like

336
00:33:36,722 --> 00:33:39,521
you could use some extra sleep yourself.

337
00:33:58,244 --> 00:34:02,440
You heard what he said. He wants
to learn all the things we know.

338
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:06,944
We couldn't teach him,
even if we wanted to.

339
00:34:07,044 --> 00:34:11,699
We... We don't know why
we do all these things.

340
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:14,052
We don't know how it all started.

341
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:29,133
Tony, we've got to
get out of here, please.

342
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,844
But to what, Tia?

343
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:34,663
Where do we go? Not to mention how.

344
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,225
The map.

345
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,669
- Mr. Bolt...
- Listen a second.

346
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:42,980
Don't lay all your cards on the table now.

347
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,857
They're very cunning.

348
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:47,443
I don't know the full
extent of their powers.

349
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:49,737
Here they could escape.

350
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:53,407
But the chalet is an island
in a sea of blinding snow.

351
00:34:53,507 --> 00:34:55,930
They'll never escape from there.

352
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,685
Nutty as a fruitcake.

353
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:03,584
You see, we have to get out of here.

354
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:07,588
I know, but there's all that high fence

355
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:09,031
- and the guards...
- Children.

356
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:15,993
Finish up your ice creams
and I'll show you to your bedrooms.

357
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:28,276
He's coming.

358
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:07,957
Come on.

359
00:36:42,908 --> 00:36:45,052
So far, so good.

360
00:36:46,654 --> 00:36:48,230
Come on!

361
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:39,181
Those dogs have ruined all my plans.

362
00:37:42,676 --> 00:37:44,553
What do you mean, it's too late?

363
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:54,196
- Now!
- Dogs, stay.

364
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:56,524
Stay!

365
00:37:58,234 --> 00:37:59,907
Good dogs.

366
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:03,556
There are some very bad men after us.

367
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:05,203
Go get 'em!

368
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,235
There's still the main gate.

369
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:19,280
They're not going to stop chasing us,
even if we get past this gate.

370
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,157
Call Thunderhead.

371
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:24,326
Thunderhead, remember what I told you?

372
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:29,898
We're at the gate now.

373
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:47,162
- Lorko's on that lever.
- I'll help.

374
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:26,239
Winkie! Winkie!

375
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:28,824
Winkie!

376
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:39,026
Find them! I don't care how you do it.

377
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:43,131
Chase them on a magic carpet if you
have to, but I want those kids back!

378
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,812
They rode out of here!

379
00:39:54,808 --> 00:39:58,504
They're... They're quite a challenge.

380
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:01,173
I will not rest
until I get those children back

381
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:03,634
and neither will you.

382
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:08,080
I'm a vengeful man, Deranian.
I don't make idle threats.

383
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:12,246
Find them!

384
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:32,855
- You'll be all right here, big fella.
- Thank you, Thunderhead.

385
00:40:41,146 --> 00:40:43,416
We'll miss you, Thunderhead.

386
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:56,205
Those sirens are for us.
We've got to keep moving. Come on.

387
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:02,627
They're getting closer.

388
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:13,662
Looks like you're taking
a mighty long trip, friend.

389
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:17,625
Yeah, I figured I'd drive
all over these United States.

390
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:20,919
Well, sir, a covered wagon
pulling out of St. Joe

391
00:41:21,019 --> 00:41:24,882
didn't take near as much supplies
as you got yourself here, Mr. O'Day.

392
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:28,327
You're sure one well-informed man,
aren't you?

393
00:41:28,902 --> 00:41:32,181
Now, do you think you could hand me
that carton without straining yourself,

394
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:36,582
or are you just tuckered out
from sticking your nose in my affairs?

395
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:51,683
We're looking for two children.
A boy and a girl. Runaways.

396
00:41:52,217 --> 00:41:55,287
Mister, if I did see 'em
I'd just as soon let 'em keep running.

397
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:58,266
As long as they're going
opposite to where I'm headed.

398
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:24,401
Well.

399
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:29,289
What do you know about that?
A drifter, huh?

400
00:43:31,149 --> 00:43:33,427
Hey, you're a friendly little fellow,
aren't you?

401
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:37,248
Hey, I've got some canned tuna for you.

402
00:43:46,164 --> 00:43:49,293
Hey, what are you doing here in my...

403
00:43:51,461 --> 00:43:55,386
Uh, yesterday when I was loading
supplies, they were looking for two kids.

404
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:57,476
Ah, a boy and a girl! You two.

405
00:43:59,052 --> 00:44:03,957
Well, let's get one thing straight
right here and now. I ain't no bus line.

406
00:44:04,057 --> 00:44:07,812
And I ain't partial to hitchhikers.
And I don't like kids.

407
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:10,672
And what's more,
I'm a mean, impatient, selfish man,

408
00:44:10,772 --> 00:44:14,572
so come out of here
and get on your way. Out! Out! Out!

409
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:18,639
Come on, out. On your way.

410
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:24,603
Wait a minute.

411
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:28,082
It ain't right for no human being
to go hungry.

412
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:32,177
I'll make you some breakfast
before you go.

413
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:37,533
Now don't get any ideas.
I got no patience with kids.

414
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:39,409
Especially runaways.

415
00:44:39,509 --> 00:44:43,764
But it's just the opposite, sir.
We're trying to find where home is.

416
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:48,148
Excuse me, but did you see a black cat?

417
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:52,865
Oh, yeah. Yours, huh?

418
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:56,489
Well, she's around somewhere.

419
00:44:57,444 --> 00:45:01,324
Go on down to the water
and clean yourselves off.

420
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:13,569
He just likes to bellow a lot.
He's not really mean.

421
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:16,092
You've got to be kidding.

422
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:36,717
Sorry, Mr. Deranian. No sign of them.

423
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:39,553
A grocer reported loading up
one of these big campers,

424
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:41,680
about the time they got away.

425
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:45,058
- They could have hidden in there.
- Any one of you spot a camper?

426
00:45:45,158 --> 00:45:49,396
I let one go through.
The driver was alone.

427
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:53,859
Big fellow? Older guy?
A zip-up jacket with fair-colored hair?

428
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:59,072
That's the one. He was in a recreation
vehicle heading north on highway L-38.

429
00:45:59,172 --> 00:46:01,675
All right, north on highway L-38.

430
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:07,516
Now get out an APB
on an RV heading north on L-38.

431
00:46:12,477 --> 00:46:16,423
You see, Mr. O'Day, we don't
expect to find our real parents,

432
00:46:16,523 --> 00:46:19,217
but maybe someone who knew them.

433
00:46:19,317 --> 00:46:21,511
And can explain things to us.

434
00:46:21,611 --> 00:46:24,706
We've got to make sure
Mr. Bolt and Deranian don't catch us.

435
00:46:25,782 --> 00:46:30,938
Well, maybe that's the truth,
and maybe it ain't.

436
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:33,607
But I'm not going to complicate things.

437
00:46:33,707 --> 00:46:35,960
I'm gonna be on my way.

438
00:46:42,215 --> 00:46:46,641
What did I do with my keys?
I know I had them in my...

439
00:46:55,645 --> 00:46:57,631
I must have lost them out there.

440
00:46:57,731 --> 00:46:59,733
You should have a spare key, sir.

441
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:02,678
I know that, young lady.

442
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:07,557
I am not a losing man.
Least not till you showed up.

443
00:47:07,657 --> 00:47:10,661
Sir? Do you know a place
called Stony Creek?

444
00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:16,050
Stony Creek? Yes. Good fishing there.

445
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:22,698
- If we get the motor started...
- And clean up the back section...

446
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:24,533
Will you take us there?

447
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:25,951
Ah.

448
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:28,930
So that's it!

449
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:33,959
You're nothing but a conniving pair
of undersized land pirates!

450
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:37,188
You swiped my keys
to make sure you'd get a ride!

451
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:41,863
- Give me my keys.
- Sir?

452
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:45,345
The engine will start now.

453
00:48:12,013 --> 00:48:14,107
All right.

454
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:17,753
You go back there and you clean up.

455
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:20,380
Make everything shipshape.

456
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,653
I'll see that you get to Stony Creek.

457
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:41,610
You just remembered something.

458
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:43,904
It has something to do with the ocean.

459
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:45,130
Come on.

460
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:48,976
Go on back, clean up.
Let's get on the way.

461
00:49:35,096 --> 00:49:36,790
Sure is a nice day.

462
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:39,313
Not with the prices you charge for gas.

463
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:53,098
Keep real still.
This fellow's acting mighty peculiar.

464
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:54,975
Nobody can know we're with you.

465
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:58,645
Maybe not. At least you'll be
out of my hair by tomorrow.

466
00:49:58,745 --> 00:50:00,856
We should make it to Stony Creek by then.

467
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:03,650
- How much?
- $10 even.

468
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:05,569
There you are.

469
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:34,806
Mr. O'Day? I think you bought too much.

470
00:50:34,906 --> 00:50:39,082
Yeah, Winkie can't drink four quarts
of milk between now and tomorrow!

471
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:41,021
Well, if you two weren't joshing me

472
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:44,399
about Aristotle Bolt being after you,

473
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:48,153
we might be together
longer than we'd planned.

474
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:52,178
He's a powerful man, too po...

475
00:50:55,885 --> 00:50:57,387
Motorcycle cop.

476
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:03,251
That attendant at the gas station.

477
00:51:03,351 --> 00:51:05,879
You won't get in trouble,
will you, Mr. O'Day?

478
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:08,402
It's not me he's after.

479
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:32,799
On second thought,
I might not drop you off too soon.

480
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:35,760
I might be able to squeeze
an honest day's work out of you.

481
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:36,907
Take you fishing.

482
00:52:38,154 --> 00:52:40,223
Deep-sea fishing, maybe.

483
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:43,873
Pit you two against
half a ton of blue marlin.

484
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:57,824
Tia, what are you thinking about?

485
00:52:57,924 --> 00:53:01,770
About before. It had to do with fishing.

486
00:53:02,011 --> 00:53:06,583
- With Daddy Malone?
- No. No.

487
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:08,685
But we were on a boat.

488
00:53:09,227 --> 00:53:11,195
A trawler.

489
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:13,861
Like Daddy Malone had.

490
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:17,452
That's all I remember.

491
00:53:19,612 --> 00:53:23,082
Every law man in the county
is probably looking for this camper.

492
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:34,027
There you are. Some hot chocolate?

493
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:36,129
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

494
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:42,369
- What's that you have there?
- My star case.

495
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:46,373
Here. Let me show you what we found
in the secret compartment.

496
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:49,501
- See where Stony Creek is, Mr. O'Day?
- Yes.

497
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:54,198
Well, there's a path that leads away
from it. Up into some mountains.

498
00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:56,508
We think that's where we may come from.

499
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:59,719
Somewhere in those mountains.

500
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:04,349
No, I don't think it was that way.

501
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:06,451
Not exactly.

502
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:27,689
There was an accident.

503
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:29,603
Well, go on!

504
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:32,477
I... It's gone.

505
00:54:32,727 --> 00:54:34,129
What kind of an accident?

506
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:36,089
I don't know.

507
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:39,551
- In a car?
- No.

508
00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:42,530
At... On the ocean!

509
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:45,369
Someone helped me save my star case.

510
00:54:46,115 --> 00:54:47,100
Well, who?

511
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:52,272
Whoever put the map in the star case
hid it so well,

512
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:54,399
it took you all these years to find it.

513
00:54:54,499 --> 00:54:58,470
That's right, Mr. O'Day.
Why would anybody do that?

514
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:01,719
I don't know. Maybe...

515
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:06,619
Maybe waiting for you to get old enough
to do something about it.

516
00:55:06,719 --> 00:55:07,845
Like now!

517
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:10,732
Very peculiar, huh?

518
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:14,235
I wonder...

519
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:19,408
I wonder how I'd handle you kids
if you were mine.

520
00:55:21,433 --> 00:55:23,219
Well...

521
00:55:23,319 --> 00:55:25,638
Maybe that's why I never married, huh?

522
00:55:25,738 --> 00:55:27,490
But, Mr. O'Day...

523
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:29,785
You were married.

524
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:33,563
What?

525
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:37,588
A long, long time ago.
And she was so pretty.

526
00:55:38,167 --> 00:55:39,794
And you had a little house.

527
00:55:40,545 --> 00:55:43,344
Yeah, I can see it.

528
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:47,952
It was white, with yellow shutters.

529
00:55:48,052 --> 00:55:51,164
And there was a big elm branch
over the whole roof.

530
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:55,110
Tony knows about people.
He can see places they've been.

531
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:01,633
- What else?
- Well, your wife died.

532
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:06,262
Only a few months after
you were married. And you were so sad.

533
00:56:06,362 --> 00:56:08,848
You took an oath
that you'd never give your love

534
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:11,726
to another woman, or to anyone.

535
00:56:11,826 --> 00:56:14,249
And you never have.

536
00:56:19,959 --> 00:56:21,903
I'm sorry, Mr. O'Day.

537
00:56:22,003 --> 00:56:23,505
The name's Jason.

538
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:27,242
If you know so dang much about me,
you might as well use it.

539
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:31,287
- Jason, you understand?
- I like the name Jason.

540
00:56:31,387 --> 00:56:33,685
We didn't mean to make you sad, Jason.

541
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:51,224
Come on. Are we going to dawdle here
all night? Let's clean up here.

542
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:53,393
Get some sack time in.

543
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:56,417
We'll pull out of here
a couple of hours before sunup.

544
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:06,636
They're headed towards Longview.
Do you understand that, Sheriff?

545
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:12,245
Mr. Deranian, $1,000 reward
speaks mighty clear in these parts.

546
00:57:12,345 --> 00:57:13,746
You can count on me.

547
00:57:13,846 --> 00:57:17,817
- Yes, I'll do that, Sheriff.
- It's been a pleasure, a real...

548
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:24,775
A real pleasure.

549
00:57:43,459 --> 00:57:45,882
Hey, Ubermann. Over there.

550
00:58:17,702 --> 00:58:19,579
This time no mistake.

551
00:59:41,494 --> 00:59:45,606
Now, listen close.
We're coming into Longview.

552
00:59:45,706 --> 00:59:49,506
My brother's house is about two miles
outside of town up the north road.

553
00:59:49,627 --> 00:59:51,721
His name is Hiram O'Day.

554
00:59:54,715 --> 00:59:56,467
There's a car behind us, Jason.

555
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:03,416
Somewhere in Longview I'll find a place
to make a fast turn and a quick stop.

556
01:00:03,516 --> 01:00:07,336
You two jump out the side door
and hide, you got that?

557
01:00:07,436 --> 01:00:09,756
Sure, Jason. You watch Winkie, now.

558
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:11,199
Yeah.

559
01:00:11,524 --> 01:00:16,405
I'll keep going. If luck is with us,
Deranian and his pal will follow me.

560
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:18,097
You wait till he gets past.

561
01:00:18,197 --> 01:00:20,767
Then we'll head
for your brother's house, right?

562
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:22,369
Hiram O'Day.

563
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:26,088
Don't lose him.

564
01:01:16,464 --> 01:01:20,685
Well, now! Welcome to Longview.

565
01:01:32,897 --> 01:01:38,010
6:10 a.m. Okay, let's have your names.

566
01:01:38,110 --> 01:01:41,284
- Tony Castaway.
- Tia Casta...

567
01:01:44,909 --> 01:01:49,005
Castaway? That's no name, it's a word.

568
01:01:49,455 --> 01:01:52,959
Your legal name is Malone,
and don't go kidding me about that.

569
01:01:56,754 --> 01:01:59,633
I think I'll let you see
what lying to the law gets you.

570
01:02:00,549 --> 01:02:02,426
Hmm.

571
01:02:21,112 --> 01:02:22,955
In you go.

572
01:02:50,349 --> 01:02:52,960
Tony, I've been thinking about

573
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:55,922
why we would have said
our name is "Castaway."

574
01:02:56,022 --> 01:02:59,383
I think it might have something to do
with us speaking another language.

575
01:02:59,483 --> 01:03:03,329
- When the Malones took us in.
- Another language?

576
01:03:03,988 --> 01:03:06,116
That's why we didn't talk for so long.

577
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:09,710
You mean we had to learn English?

578
01:03:10,327 --> 01:03:16,050
We spoke a funny kind of language.
Uncle Bene spoke it to us.

579
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:17,718
Who's Uncle Bene?

580
01:03:30,931 --> 01:03:32,166
I...

581
01:03:32,266 --> 01:03:35,520
I think he died. Drowned.

582
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:37,443
What did he look like?

583
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:40,800
He had white hair...

584
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:44,261
I'll tell you, we don't want
no panic around here, Sheriff.

585
01:03:44,361 --> 01:03:48,724
Well, I've been in touch
with Mr. Deranian and he's on his way.

586
01:03:48,824 --> 01:03:51,327
I'll be home if you need me, Sheriff.

587
01:03:51,577 --> 01:03:54,126
Tia, we've gotta think of something fast.

588
01:04:01,962 --> 01:04:04,431
Hey, Tony, look.

589
01:04:12,389 --> 01:04:15,563
Tony, that bear looks so unhappy.

590
01:04:21,065 --> 01:04:23,534
Tia, we need my harmonica.

591
01:04:48,717 --> 01:04:50,845
Now open the cell door.

592
01:05:11,657 --> 01:05:14,185
When I get the star case,
you run out to the edge of the woods.

593
01:05:14,285 --> 01:05:16,437
As soon as I free the bear, I'll be there.

594
01:05:16,537 --> 01:05:19,732
Tia, how do you expect us to get
anyplace with a great big bear?

595
01:05:19,832 --> 01:05:21,442
He's counting on me.

596
01:05:21,542 --> 01:05:24,070
But this is an emergency.
Come off it, will you?

597
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:29,017
We still have to get past the sheriff.
Why don't you start thinking about that?

598
01:06:31,612 --> 01:06:34,411
Hey. Hey, what?

599
01:07:22,454 --> 01:07:24,627
Get that thing off of me!

600
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:31,632
I just hope we don't have to pass a zoo
before we get where we're going.

601
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:38,806
Look, I know what I saw!

602
01:08:38,906 --> 01:08:41,475
And I say there's only one explanation!

603
01:08:41,575 --> 01:08:46,438
Those two kids are witches!
And they're from Witch Mountain.

604
01:08:47,998 --> 01:08:51,944
I want every available townsman
to arm themselves,

605
01:08:52,044 --> 01:08:54,113
and we'll divvy up into hunting groups.

606
01:08:54,213 --> 01:08:58,075
Hey, Sheriff. Whatcha gonna do, chase
them all the way to Witch Mountain?

607
01:08:58,175 --> 01:08:59,451
Yeah!

608
01:08:59,551 --> 01:09:01,553
We'll stop them before they get there!

609
01:09:03,889 --> 01:09:08,315
Now you listen close
and I'll give you the areas to cover.

610
01:09:09,353 --> 01:09:11,130
Those look like hunting parties.

611
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:22,516
They got away, Mr. Deranian,
but we know what they are.

612
01:09:22,616 --> 01:09:24,601
Evil itself. We got to catch them.

613
01:09:24,701 --> 01:09:27,146
He's right. They're from Witch Mountain.

614
01:09:27,246 --> 01:09:29,398
Sheriff, we need some more ammunition.

615
01:09:29,498 --> 01:09:30,899
All right.

616
01:09:30,999 --> 01:09:33,252
We'll get them, Mr. Deranian.

617
01:09:36,338 --> 01:09:38,741
They've really got blood in their eyes.

618
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:41,970
There's no use
trying to reason with them now, sir.

619
01:09:49,601 --> 01:09:53,105
Security? This is Deranian.

620
01:09:54,148 --> 01:09:59,530
I want a complete check on a Jason O'Day.

621
01:10:11,999 --> 01:10:15,110
Tia, I know how you feel about the bear,

622
01:10:15,210 --> 01:10:17,529
and I think he's real neat too, but...

623
01:10:17,629 --> 01:10:21,200
Well, a lot of people
are gonna be looking for us,

624
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:23,452
and he'll be safer on his own.

625
01:10:23,552 --> 01:10:27,273
Anyway, they might shoot him.
Just for the sport of it.

626
01:10:28,473 --> 01:10:29,567
Look.

627
01:10:30,184 --> 01:10:33,905
He'll be safe there until tonight.
Then he can move on when it's dark.

628
01:10:34,146 --> 01:10:37,049
Maybe you're right. I'll talk to him.

629
01:10:37,149 --> 01:10:39,652
You be a good bear and wait in that cave.

630
01:10:44,364 --> 01:10:46,833
We don't want anything to happen to you.

631
01:10:52,289 --> 01:10:55,275
Tony, his feelings were hurt.

632
01:11:47,219 --> 01:11:48,266
Watch it!

633
01:12:02,234 --> 01:12:03,702
Jason!

634
01:12:04,611 --> 01:12:05,637
Oh!

635
01:12:05,737 --> 01:12:09,516
These woods are full of hunters looking
for you. They think you're witches.

636
01:12:09,616 --> 01:12:12,436
Brother Hiram ain't home,
but I'll get you some food.

637
01:12:12,536 --> 01:12:14,630
You'll have a good rest.

638
01:12:20,669 --> 01:12:22,696
There's a brother. Hiram O'Day.

639
01:12:22,796 --> 01:12:26,596
244 Cahill, just north of Longview.

640
01:12:27,843 --> 01:12:31,518
Fifteen minutes.
We can be there in 15 minutes.

641
01:12:39,521 --> 01:12:43,675
But I still can't figure out why we both
came up with a name like "Castaway."

642
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:48,076
I noticed that you two
are very smart for your years.

643
01:12:48,822 --> 01:12:50,870
You really know what a "castaway" is?

644
01:12:51,783 --> 01:12:56,146
Sure. It's like being shipwrecked
and left on a desert island.

645
01:12:56,246 --> 01:12:59,399
- Ah.
- Tony, I just remembered!

646
01:12:59,499 --> 01:13:03,299
"Castaway." That's the name
of someone we're supposed to see.

647
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:07,675
That's funny.
I just remembered the same thing.

648
01:13:08,258 --> 01:13:11,182
But suppose you two are castaways?

649
01:13:11,887 --> 01:13:14,331
Then it would sure fit
things Tia's been remembering.

650
01:13:14,431 --> 01:13:16,375
Uh-huh.

651
01:13:16,475 --> 01:13:20,571
We were in some kind of wreck, Jason.
And we were in the sea.

652
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:23,549
You mean like a boat sinking?

653
01:13:23,649 --> 01:13:28,496
I guess. But if it was a boat,
I don't remember where it came from.

654
01:13:29,529 --> 01:13:31,156
We had an uncle.

655
01:13:32,157 --> 01:13:34,059
Uncle Bene.

656
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:37,688
He kept us afloat. And then he drowned.

657
01:13:37,788 --> 01:13:39,506
Oh.

658
01:13:39,873 --> 01:13:43,377
For a long time we didn't understand
anything anyone would say.

659
01:13:44,336 --> 01:13:46,555
You must have come
from some other country.

660
01:13:47,714 --> 01:13:49,741
But we won't know all the truth

661
01:13:49,841 --> 01:13:52,369
until we get to the mountains
above Stony Creek.

662
01:13:52,469 --> 01:13:55,598
- Like it shows on the map.
- Witch Mountain.

663
01:13:57,849 --> 01:14:01,378
My brother Hiram mentioned
that place to me in his letters.

664
01:14:01,478 --> 01:14:03,922
He said some strangers
came and settled there,

665
01:14:04,022 --> 01:14:06,592
kept pretty much to themselves,

666
01:14:06,692 --> 01:14:10,178
and nobody ever knew where they came from.

667
01:14:10,278 --> 01:14:12,431
You think they might be your people?

668
01:14:12,531 --> 01:14:14,454
They must be!

669
01:14:20,872 --> 01:14:25,569
Security? Have you notified Mr. Bolt
of our destination?

670
01:14:25,669 --> 01:14:27,546
Then do so.

671
01:14:46,106 --> 01:14:49,134
We've just received communication
from Mr. Deranian, sir.

672
01:14:49,234 --> 01:14:53,055
He's on his way to a Mr. Hiram O'Day's
cabin in the hills north of Longview.

673
01:14:53,155 --> 01:14:55,724
- Don't just sit here, get going!
- Yes, sir.

674
01:14:55,824 --> 01:15:01,854
Well, when Hiram gets home
he's gonna find his cupboard is bare.

675
01:15:14,259 --> 01:15:15,410
Gotta get going.

676
01:15:15,510 --> 01:15:17,478
Come on, camper's out in back.

677
01:15:19,765 --> 01:15:20,749
Tia!

678
01:15:20,849 --> 01:15:23,168
Can you hear me?

679
01:15:23,268 --> 01:15:25,629
We need another favor.

680
01:15:25,729 --> 01:15:28,798
- Tia, come on.
- Come on, Tia.

681
01:15:45,624 --> 01:15:50,346
There's no way we can get by them
without their seeing us.

682
01:16:20,325 --> 01:16:22,394
I remember more.

683
01:16:22,494 --> 01:16:27,190
It wasn't just Uncle Bene who died
in the ocean when our ship went down,

684
01:16:27,290 --> 01:16:29,418
a lot of other people died too.

685
01:16:29,668 --> 01:16:33,572
And those people, the people
that live here in these mountains,

686
01:16:33,672 --> 01:16:37,472
well, all of us came from the same
country, but on different ships.

687
01:16:38,385 --> 01:16:44,108
Why then now, you mean yours sank,
and the others made it to port?

688
01:16:44,933 --> 01:16:50,611
But, Tony, it wasn't a country.
It was a place.

689
01:16:51,523 --> 01:16:55,369
Yeah, a place that isn't there anymore.

690
01:16:56,736 --> 01:16:57,862
Castaways?

691
01:16:59,239 --> 01:17:02,539
That's why my people
called themselves that, and...

692
01:17:03,702 --> 01:17:06,376
And this was the emblem
for where we used to live.

693
01:17:07,706 --> 01:17:12,110
Two stars?
I don't know no place named that.

694
01:17:12,210 --> 01:17:13,945
It wasn't called that.

695
01:17:14,045 --> 01:17:19,267
No. Two stars...
Because our world had two suns!

696
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:23,872
- Double stars!
- Another planet!

697
01:17:23,972 --> 01:17:25,974
A whole other solar system!

698
01:17:28,435 --> 01:17:30,984
Well, then... It wasn't a boat.

699
01:17:32,981 --> 01:17:35,109
It was a spaceship!

700
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:39,696
Our planet was dying.

701
01:17:40,238 --> 01:17:44,559
The only industry left
was the manufacturing of spaceships.

702
01:17:44,659 --> 01:17:46,353
Like ours.

703
01:17:46,453 --> 01:17:48,751
And we had to find
another planet to live on.

704
01:17:50,457 --> 01:17:55,213
Then the other ships in your cluster
landed here in these mountains,

705
01:17:55,962 --> 01:17:57,839
and yours didn't make it.

706
01:17:58,006 --> 01:18:01,493
I think we might have been the only ones

707
01:18:01,593 --> 01:18:04,437
on our spaceship to have survived.

708
01:18:51,977 --> 01:18:54,321
We lost them again.

709
01:18:54,646 --> 01:18:58,992
We're going to go south on highway
211. Why don't you search the north?

710
01:19:18,128 --> 01:19:20,506
Not too many people around, are there?

711
01:19:22,132 --> 01:19:26,137
"Misty Valley Cooperative." This is it.

712
01:19:41,901 --> 01:19:44,450
Maybe they've gone out to lunch.

713
01:19:46,823 --> 01:19:48,200
We'll wait.

714
01:20:01,588 --> 01:20:05,367
Are you the Longview bunch
chasing after those two witch kids?

715
01:20:05,467 --> 01:20:07,014
That's right, mister.

716
01:20:07,218 --> 01:20:09,955
My name's Cort. You the guy's
putting up the reward or what?

717
01:20:10,055 --> 01:20:14,376
Yes, that's right.
Except that it's now $5,000.

718
01:20:14,476 --> 01:20:18,296
- Five thousand, huh?
- But there's a catch.

719
01:20:18,396 --> 01:20:22,617
I want those two children alive. I don't
care what happens to the old man.

720
01:20:22,734 --> 01:20:25,112
They were last seen
in a camper headed this way.

721
01:20:26,237 --> 01:20:28,390
Those words got
a mighty good sound, friend.

722
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:30,117
Any idea where to look for them?

723
01:20:31,159 --> 01:20:33,582
Well, they're not around here.
That's for sure.

724
01:20:34,621 --> 01:20:38,626
Maybe the next town up the line.
Stony Creek?

725
01:20:57,393 --> 01:20:59,629
Stony Creek?

726
01:20:59,729 --> 01:21:01,777
We're changing course now.

727
01:21:10,949 --> 01:21:13,953
They sure had time enough
for a lunch break.

728
01:21:19,666 --> 01:21:22,590
There's something to do
with the phone book.

729
01:21:33,763 --> 01:21:36,266
Let me have another look at that map.

730
01:21:44,691 --> 01:21:46,693
Misty Valley Cooperative.

731
01:21:47,652 --> 01:21:50,972
I was calling the Castaway family
and I was wondering if...

732
01:21:51,072 --> 01:21:55,143
It's all right.
Were you looking for Mr. Castaway?

733
01:21:55,243 --> 01:21:56,586
Yes!

734
01:21:59,414 --> 01:22:01,508
Watch it! Here comes Deranian!

735
01:22:02,292 --> 01:22:04,235
- Is this Tony?
- Yes.

736
01:22:04,335 --> 01:22:07,072
- Is Tia with you?
- Yes. Who is this?

737
01:22:07,172 --> 01:22:08,740
Thank the blessed stars!

738
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:10,658
We've been searching for you for years.

739
01:22:10,758 --> 01:22:14,037
Now listen carefully.
Everything must time out.

740
01:22:14,137 --> 01:22:18,416
Take the back door
and go to Mr. O'Day's camper.

741
01:22:29,402 --> 01:22:33,348
Children, we want to make sure
Mr. Deranian doesn't lose you.

742
01:22:33,448 --> 01:22:37,352
We have a plan that should discourage
them from ever pursuing you again.

743
01:22:37,452 --> 01:22:39,125
Come on! Come on!

744
01:22:42,207 --> 01:22:43,858
Everything's all right, Jason.

745
01:22:43,958 --> 01:22:47,553
You've got a funny idea
of what's "all right."

746
01:22:49,297 --> 01:22:52,050
Maybe Bolt can spot the RV
from the helicopter.

747
01:22:54,344 --> 01:22:56,267
Hey, men, come on!

748
01:23:19,869 --> 01:23:24,170
We've got a fix on them, sir.
Robertson Canyon. Headed north.

749
01:23:33,758 --> 01:23:37,370
There's no way he can lose us
in that monster he's driving.

750
01:23:37,470 --> 01:23:39,143
Close in on them.

751
01:23:40,390 --> 01:23:43,042
He's not exactly crawling.

752
01:23:51,317 --> 01:23:53,820
They're getting closer, Tony.

753
01:24:42,035 --> 01:24:43,228
Good driving, Al.

754
01:24:43,328 --> 01:24:45,730
- How'd we wind up here?
- Another fine mess you...

755
01:24:45,830 --> 01:24:48,208
- Come on, let's get out...
- Look out. The door!

756
01:24:54,839 --> 01:24:56,841
Guys, let's go.

757
01:25:01,237 --> 01:25:03,831
Very ingenious, Tony.

758
01:25:03,931 --> 01:25:07,252
But don't forget, we want Deranian
to see what's coming up.

759
01:25:07,352 --> 01:25:09,087
I don't understand, sir.

760
01:25:09,187 --> 01:25:13,758
Well, we have something planned
that will convince Deranian and Bolt

761
01:25:13,858 --> 01:25:17,362
that you're both
out of their reach forever.

762
01:26:38,651 --> 01:26:40,678
Deranian, listen to me.

763
01:26:40,778 --> 01:26:43,348
I spotted a route
that lets you cut in ahead of them.

764
01:26:43,448 --> 01:26:46,392
It's the second turn on the left.

765
01:26:46,492 --> 01:26:49,604
Now signal the others not to follow you.
Repeat. Not.

766
01:26:49,704 --> 01:26:51,001
Understood.

767
01:28:33,432 --> 01:28:34,959
I don't believe it.

768
01:28:35,059 --> 01:28:38,754
- It's what you call levitation.
- That ain't what I call it.

769
01:28:38,854 --> 01:28:41,466
You two got powers beyond belief.

770
01:28:41,566 --> 01:28:42,800
We're not doing this.

771
01:28:42,900 --> 01:28:46,262
This is something too powerful
for us to do.

772
01:28:46,362 --> 01:28:48,535
Somebody else is making this happen.

773
01:29:02,211 --> 01:29:04,088
Whoee!

774
01:29:59,644 --> 01:30:02,318
That thing's flying upside down.

775
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:06,613
That's impossible.

776
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:10,284
That kind of vehicle
can't fly upside down.

777
01:30:11,155 --> 01:30:13,578
It's not supposed to fly at all.

778
01:30:25,461 --> 01:30:26,838
They're not upside down. We are.

779
01:31:18,347 --> 01:31:21,942
The voice says we should
get out here and wait.

780
01:31:36,741 --> 01:31:39,745
We'll never forget you, Jason.

781
01:31:40,536 --> 01:31:42,355
Would you take care of Winkie?

782
01:31:42,455 --> 01:31:45,584
Oh, no. Winkie's your cat.

783
01:31:46,041 --> 01:31:49,362
It wouldn't be right
for her to be with anybody else.

784
01:31:49,462 --> 01:31:50,930
It would make us happy.

785
01:31:51,255 --> 01:31:55,260
It sure would.
And I think Winkie would like it too.

786
01:31:56,469 --> 01:32:00,581
Maybe we ought to ask Winkie
how she feels about that.

787
01:32:00,681 --> 01:32:05,002
Winkie, how do you feel about
going around now

788
01:32:05,102 --> 01:32:08,188
with a crusty old man?

789
01:32:12,943 --> 01:32:16,413
Look, if you don't mind...

790
01:32:17,907 --> 01:32:20,559
I'd like to plan on, uh,

791
01:32:20,659 --> 01:32:25,460
remembering you two
as if you were my kids.

792
01:32:28,876 --> 01:32:31,379
The kids I never had.

793
01:32:49,313 --> 01:32:52,817
Uncle Bene! Uncle Bene!

794
01:32:53,150 --> 01:32:55,136
Uncle Bene!

795
01:32:56,036 --> 01:32:58,389
Oh, you all did so well.

796
01:32:58,489 --> 01:33:00,662
Congratulations, Jason O'Day.

797
01:33:00,783 --> 01:33:02,560
You're a man of courage and compassion.

798
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:05,896
Uncle Bene, we thought you'd drowned.

799
01:33:05,996 --> 01:33:09,358
Well, now if you know
exactly what to say to a shark,

800
01:33:09,458 --> 01:33:12,302
he can be very accommodating.

801
01:33:15,464 --> 01:33:17,307
Ah, Tia.

802
01:33:17,508 --> 01:33:21,746
You never forgot.
You didn't lose the star case.

803
01:33:21,846 --> 01:33:23,914
We only found the map a few days ago.

804
01:33:24,014 --> 01:33:27,689
Well, I knew when you were old enough
to understand it, you'd find it.

805
01:33:29,436 --> 01:33:32,656
It's good to know that there are
Earth men such as you, Mr. O'Day.

806
01:33:33,691 --> 01:33:37,470
If the stars are willing, perhaps
some of the other children who survived

807
01:33:37,570 --> 01:33:41,140
will find men equally as kind.

808
01:33:41,240 --> 01:33:43,434
- There are more?
- Yes.

809
01:33:43,534 --> 01:33:46,395
All with star cases and maps.

810
01:33:46,495 --> 01:33:49,715
So far, only Tia and Tony
have found the way.

811
01:33:56,338 --> 01:34:00,910
Well, now that I know
what to keep my eyes peeled for,

812
01:34:01,010 --> 01:34:04,310
perhaps I could spot these surviving
kids and bring them here.

813
01:34:07,099 --> 01:34:08,396
Deranian's car.

814
01:34:18,027 --> 01:34:21,372
I'll have to tend to Bolt's helicopter.

815
01:34:21,947 --> 01:34:23,724
Stay and watch.

816
01:34:23,824 --> 01:34:26,953
You'll see how we came
into this world of yours.

817
01:35:20,089 --> 01:35:21,323
What!

818
01:35:21,423 --> 01:35:23,642
Stop this thing!

819
01:35:42,277 --> 01:35:45,030
I'm all right! Where are the children?

820
01:36:29,616 --> 01:36:33,362
I should've known there was
more than ESP with those two.

821
01:37:07,654 --> 01:37:09,827
Well, they're home now.
