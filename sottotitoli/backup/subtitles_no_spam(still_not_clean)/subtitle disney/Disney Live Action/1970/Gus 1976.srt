1
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:25,426
Go on, stjepan!
Go on, my boy!

2
00:00:25,459 --> 00:00:29,763
Watch your brother.
The greatest soccer hero
in all of yugoslavia.

3
00:00:29,797 --> 00:00:33,934
You watch, you learn!
I'm trying, papa.

4
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:45,879
Goal! Goal! Goal!

5
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,982
Aah!

6
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:02,196
Aww.

7
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,465
Watch this, Gus.

8
00:01:10,338 --> 00:01:14,442
- Ohh!
- Andy! Andy!

9
00:01:14,475 --> 00:01:17,978
Andy! Andy!

10
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:20,481
Are you all right?

11
00:01:24,452 --> 00:01:26,454
Give me
your hand, son.

12
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:39,833
See, mama?
Now we have
two heroes.

13
00:01:39,867 --> 00:01:44,505
One soccer hero
and one deep-sea
diver. Bah!

14
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:51,612
Andy. Oh,
be a good boy.

15
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:53,681
Stay with butterfly
collection, huh?

16
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:13,167
Ah, I give up.

17
00:02:13,201 --> 00:02:17,338
I wish I never had to see
a soccer ball again
as long as I live.

18
00:02:30,384 --> 00:02:32,953
Gus? Could you
do that again?

19
00:02:40,361 --> 00:02:42,863
Ready, Gus. Oich!

20
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:02,350
My father gets the paper
from yugoslavia. I thought
that was pretty funny.

21
00:03:02,383 --> 00:03:07,488
Yeah. Yeah. Thanks,
Debbie, but even if
I was yugoslavian,

22
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:10,258
I'd have trouble
laughing these days.

23
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:13,894
But a mule that kicks
100-yard soccer goals is kinda
terrific, don't you think?

24
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:19,267
Yeah. Especially since
we got nobody that can kick
any kind of ball five yards.

25
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,580
This is monaghan, Mr. Cooper,
against the packers.

26
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,383
That one cost us
a 15-yard penalty,
if I remember.

27
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:13,754
Yeah. That was
the smallest loss
we had all day.

28
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:56,263
Uh, what do you want to do
about monaghan, Mr. Cooper?

29
00:04:56,296 --> 00:05:00,167
Trade him to the packers.
They oughta love him.

30
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,670
He played a better game
for them than he did for us.

31
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:05,339
Yes, sir.

32
00:05:06,874 --> 00:05:09,309
Oh, uh, this is lindstrom,
against the rams.

33
00:05:58,626 --> 00:06:01,094
What was he doin'?
Wavin' to his girlfriend
in the stands?

34
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:04,398
Well, I don't think so,
Mr. Cooper. Uh,
lindstrom's married.

35
00:06:04,432 --> 00:06:07,234
Mm.
That's probably why
he's asking for more money.

36
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:09,437
What? He must be
out of his head.

37
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:13,206
And that was
the blow that did it.

38
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,477
Uh, this is zebrowski,
Mr. Cooper.

39
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:48,576
What do we do about
zebrowski, Mr. Cooper?

40
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:51,278
- Try the falcons.
- Uh, they don't want him.

41
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:53,113
Uh, I don't think we got
anybody they want.

42
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:57,618
Coach, we got
nobody we want.

43
00:07:00,688 --> 00:07:04,024
Uh, here's, uh,
vanowen, Mr. Cooper.

44
00:07:05,526 --> 00:07:07,995
He's the only bright spot
in our entire offense.

45
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:54,441
Well, I was thinking,
maybe if, uh,

46
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,277
the other players
promise not
to congratulate so hard,

47
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:01,381
we could coax him
out of retirement?

48
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:04,685
- Debbie?
- Would you do me a favor?

49
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:08,455
I brought your aspirin,
Mr. Cooper.
Oh, good.

50
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,958
You've seen these
film clips, haven't you?

51
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:14,027
Mr. Cooper, I saw
all the games.

52
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:16,630
Mm-hmm.

53
00:08:16,664 --> 00:08:21,301
All right, outside of Rob cargil
at middle linebacker,
what have we got?

54
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,470
Oh, we got a pretty good
defense, Mr. Cooper.

55
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,607
Our boys have learned
how to hit a few people.

56
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:50,430
If we can only teach 'em
which team to hit--

57
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:02,375
*

58
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,516
men, we're comin' off
a tough season,

59
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:13,286
but this year's gonna be
a whole new ball game.

60
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,623
Now, as we open
training camp,

61
00:09:15,656 --> 00:09:19,526
I'd like to introduce
some of my new coaches--
some of my assistants.

62
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,795
Now, with the help
of these men,

63
00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:26,566
I'm gonna turn
the California atoms
into a solid ball team.

64
00:09:38,846 --> 00:09:41,615
I see ya got
the same old faces
behind those batons.

65
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:45,452
Well, a lot of those atomettes
have been with the organization
a few years, Mr. Cooper.

66
00:09:45,485 --> 00:09:47,655
It's pretty tough to just,
you know, let 'em go.

67
00:09:47,688 --> 00:09:49,823
Especially when
they're gettin' so close
to their pensions.

68
00:09:49,857 --> 00:09:52,225
But listen to this.

69
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:56,129
I've been giving it a lot
of thought, and I have come up
with a clever new idea.

70
00:09:56,163 --> 00:09:58,265
You're redecoratin'
their wheelchairs.

71
00:09:58,298 --> 00:10:00,500
No. No, no, no, listen.

72
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:02,970
Starting this fall,
for all atomettes,

73
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:07,507
if you're ten years married
or got three kids, you're out.

74
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:11,111
*

75
00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:17,751
one thing, this band sounds
better than the one last year.

76
00:10:17,785 --> 00:10:19,486
It certainly does.

77
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,689
*

78
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:33,166
*

79
00:10:42,743 --> 00:10:45,679
One thing I thought
I could count on was
a decent halftime show...

80
00:10:45,713 --> 00:10:47,881
That would pull in
a few people.

81
00:10:47,915 --> 00:10:50,450
When a man's relatives stop
asking for free passes,
he's in trouble.

82
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:53,453
But I got lots more talent
for you to see, Mr. Cooper.
Wait'll you see this.

83
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,957
- Uh, Elizabeth?
- One, two! One, two!

84
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,559
Elizabeth?
Yeah?

85
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:03,196
Do some of those wonderful
little flip-flops
for Mr. Cooper.

86
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,565
Oh, sure, Mr. Barnsdale.

87
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:19,179
Very nice, Elizabeth.
Very nice.

88
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:26,720
That should bring in
a few people,
especially doctors.

89
00:11:26,754 --> 00:11:30,357
I got some other
great ideas, Mr. Cooper.
I saw this act on TV.

90
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,860
This elephant
actually twirls a Baton
with its trunk.

91
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:35,763
Now I figure we just
dress him up like--
Joe, if I wanted an animal act,

92
00:11:35,796 --> 00:11:39,332
I'd get that
yugoslavian mule who kicks
100-yard soccer goals.

93
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:43,070
Oh, yeah. Debbie showed me
that story. Even I'd pay
to see that, I think.

94
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:45,538
Might be worth a look,
if it's for real.

95
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:47,841
All it takes is a round-trip
ticket to yugoslavia
for me to find out.

96
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:52,445
No, no. Takes more than that.
Takes someone to loan me
the money to buy you the ticket.

97
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:55,015
Lineman's calisthenics.

98
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,350
Blackboard drill.

99
00:11:57,384 --> 00:12:00,353
Postgame films.

100
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,455
All right, I guess
that about covers it
for the coaches.

101
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:05,292
- Now, how many players
we got here?
- None.

102
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:08,161
- None?
- They're not due
till tomorrow.

103
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,398
Oh, well, then
we'll just, uh--

104
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:15,168
all right, let's
go to work, men.

105
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:25,578
Unbelievable.
Un-be-liev-able!

106
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:28,381
That's right, operator.
To thousand oaks, California.

107
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:32,619
The message reads,
"mule for real.
Never misses at 100 yards."

108
00:12:36,323 --> 00:12:39,759
Uh, operator?
"Sometimes misses at 110."

109
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:45,765
- Hoo-hoo-hoo!
- Well, what do you think,
Mr. Cooper?

110
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:49,602
It might just be
an expensive bomb.
I'm not sure I'm that desperate.

111
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:54,174
Mr. Cooper?

112
00:12:56,543 --> 00:13:00,948
I think we've got it.
Aah! Aah!

113
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:04,484
Wire Joe.
Sign that mule.

114
00:13:07,354 --> 00:13:10,090
Do you want
that card, Rob?

115
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:16,964
Hello?
Oh, hi, Mr. Cooper.

116
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:20,700
How would you like
to baby-sit a yugoslavian
mule and his trainer?

117
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:23,503
They signed!
Got his hoofprint
right on the dotted line.

118
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:26,173
They signed the mule
for the halftime show.

119
00:13:26,206 --> 00:13:28,675
Oh, boy, the fans'll sure
get a kick out of that.

120
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:31,344
But I gotta ask ya
a favor, Debbie.

121
00:13:31,378 --> 00:13:33,646
Since the trainer's
yugoslavian,
and you're yugoslavian--

122
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,549
well,
my parents are--
close enough.

123
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:41,855
I'm puttin' you on detached duty
and assigning you to this kid,
Andy, for a week or so...

124
00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:43,456
To keep him
from gettin' homesick.

125
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,058
Well, I haven't done
any folk dancing,

126
00:13:45,092 --> 00:13:46,994
but I'll do my best to
make him feel at home. Okay?

127
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:51,064
- Bye.
- Bye.

128
00:13:51,098 --> 00:13:54,234
What are you promisin', anyway?
Are we goin' together or not?

129
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:57,704
Well, it's only
for a week or so.
Mr. Cooper's orders.

130
00:14:09,216 --> 00:14:14,922
All incoming passengers from
trans world
airlines flight702,

131
00:14:14,955 --> 00:14:17,690
please claim your baggage
at the street entrance.

132
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:24,331
- Andy?
- Yes, Andy.

133
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:28,201
- Debbie!
- Uh, Gus.

134
00:14:28,235 --> 00:14:29,636
Uh, well, I'll
see ya in a minute.

135
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,740
Come on. Let's go.
Tuck in that ball.

136
00:14:33,773 --> 00:14:37,177
Follow through on that ball.
Way to go!

137
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:41,248
Introducing the greatest
halftime act in all of
professional football,

138
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:42,950
direct from yugoslavia.

139
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,920
Hey, Rob.
Throw Andy a ball.

140
00:14:46,954 --> 00:14:49,923
Yes, sir, Mr. Cooper.

141
00:14:49,957 --> 00:14:51,724
Here you go, kid.

142
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:55,228
Welcome to the NFL.

143
00:14:55,262 --> 00:14:57,597
You okay, kid?
O-oh, y-yes, sir.

144
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:01,734
M-my brother does it
a-all the time.

145
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:06,139
Okay. Now, I want you
to see that mule
kick this ball.

146
00:15:06,173 --> 00:15:08,241
Uh, Mr. Cooper?
Hmm?

147
00:15:08,275 --> 00:15:13,313
- Gus has never kicked
a ball like this before.
- Can't you get him to try?

148
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:16,316
For the kind of money
I laid out, I'm at least
entitled to see him miss.

149
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:18,318
Go ahead, Andy.
Just try it.

150
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,824
Go on.

151
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,840
With your finger.
Hold it with
your finger, kid.

152
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:45,178
There. Okay.

153
00:15:45,212 --> 00:15:48,815
- Now, how do you
get him to kick?
- I usually just yell, "oich."

154
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,356
Ah-ha-ha!

155
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:59,459
Right. If that's no fluke,
you might have come up
with a winner, Hank.

156
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:02,695
Yeah. A halftime show
that'll let the atoms fans
forget about the team.

157
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,168
Well, so far, in their
opening exhibition game,

158
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:10,937
the atoms haven't
disappointed us
a bit, folks.

159
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,805
Twenty seconds to go
in the first half.

160
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:16,543
It's the Cleveland browns 27,
the California atoms 0.

161
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:19,346
Manders in kick formation
for Cleveland.
He stands on his own 30.

162
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:21,181
There's the snap. It's--
oh, it's over his head!

163
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:23,183
It's trickling back
to the 25, the 20, the 15!

164
00:16:23,216 --> 00:16:27,820
A scramble for the ball--
and Rob cargil has it
for the atoms!

165
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:29,622
That's the way you do it!
That's the way.

166
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:34,961
Field goal team,
field goal team.
Everyone, out of the way!

167
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:38,665
Uh-- way to go,
big fella! Nice goin'!

168
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:42,369
Okay. Garcia,
why aren't you in uniform?

169
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:46,239
Oh, that's right.
You're one of the coaches.
Okay, o'brien! O'brien!

170
00:16:46,273 --> 00:16:49,376
Where's my placekicker?
He just went out to kick
a field goal, coach.

171
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:51,911
Oh. Yeah. Good.
Thanks. Okay.

172
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:54,647
This will be the atoms'
first score of the ball game.

173
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:59,186
Let's see. It's, uh, o'brien.
O'brien lines up for what
should be an easy three points.

174
00:17:14,101 --> 00:17:17,570
Now, folks, the moment
you've all been waiting for.

175
00:17:17,604 --> 00:17:22,008
You've read about them
in the papers. Now you're
going to see them in person.

176
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,845
Here they are, direct
from yugoslavia, Andy...

177
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,415
And his miracle mule, Gus!

178
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:29,916
*

179
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,760
I'll say this, folks.
If Andy and his friend Gus...

180
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:42,762
Are half as good
as their press notices,

181
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:46,666
the fans here will get
a lot more to cheer about than
they did in that first half!

182
00:17:48,435 --> 00:17:53,106
S-so many people.
I don't think I can
go through with this.

183
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:02,048
What's he doin' to me?
It's the crowd, Mr. Cooper.
I think he's frightened.

184
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:05,552
When I get my hands on him,
I'll give him something
to be frightened about.

185
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:08,121
Dah!

186
00:18:08,155 --> 00:18:11,291
Can we help you, Mr. Cooper?
Yeah, get out there
and do something.

187
00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:15,462
The pyramid?
Yeah, the leaning tower,
anything. Go on, go on!

188
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:18,565
All right, girls.
Form it up.

189
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:21,168
And, uh, one and two
and one and two--

190
00:18:26,473 --> 00:18:28,841
Mr. Cooper!
They're coming back!

191
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:40,187
Well, at least the crowd's
laughing, Mr. Cooper.

192
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,555
They're gonna laugh me
right into bankruptcy.

193
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,765
Now, remember, girls.
This one's for Mr. Cooper.

194
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,035
Yeah, for Mr. Cooper.

195
00:18:56,068 --> 00:19:01,441
It's all right, Gus.
I feel better now. Thanks.

196
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:08,515
Ready, Gus?

197
00:19:08,548 --> 00:19:14,020
Oich!

198
00:19:14,053 --> 00:19:16,556
Ta-da!

199
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:19,326
Oh! Oh!

200
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:22,329
Great!

201
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:33,039
Well, there's a new wrinkle
in atomland. Not the atoms.

202
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:37,877
They have the same old ones,
and the old wrinkles lost
to the browns 41 to zip tonight.

203
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:41,914
But that halftime show,
with Andy and the mule Gus,
that was something else again.

204
00:19:41,948 --> 00:19:45,718
After a shaky start,
the four-legged atom
put three 100-yard kicks...

205
00:19:45,752 --> 00:19:47,520
Straight through the uprights.

206
00:19:47,554 --> 00:19:50,390
Hank Cooper may have found
himself a real drawing card.

207
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:54,661
Question is, will it be enough
to pull the ex-garbage king
out of the dumps?

208
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:59,266
Financial, that is.
This sportscaster
doesn't think so.

209
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:06,205
- Cigar, Charlie?
- Hank, whenever you
offer me a cigar,

210
00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:09,709
old friends start
to become cunning enemies.

211
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:13,880
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie!

212
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:16,683
How long
we been playin'
poker together?

213
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:20,753
Twenty years? Twenty-five?
Sure, that's how I got
talked into the note.

214
00:20:20,787 --> 00:20:23,256
Well, what
I'm gettin' at,
Charlie, is this.

215
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:29,095
You're a man who likes
to take a chance, and
I think I got a deal for ya.

216
00:20:29,128 --> 00:20:33,633
- Like what?
- Like, say,
we make a bet.

217
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:38,070
Like, say, if I win,
I keep the club.

218
00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:42,409
If I lose, you buy it--
at your price.

219
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:48,281
Well, now, that
sounds interesting.
What's your wager?

220
00:20:48,315 --> 00:20:51,584
I say... the atoms...

221
00:20:51,618 --> 00:20:55,221
Win... half
their ball games.

222
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,123
Wha-- seven games?

223
00:21:00,327 --> 00:21:04,230
Th-that's more than they won
in the last ten years
put together.

224
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,233
- Not a bad bet, huh?
- Ye-- well, now wait a minute.

225
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,502
Wait a minute.
What's the catch?

226
00:21:09,536 --> 00:21:13,440
- No catch.
- What are you,
some sort of a nut?

227
00:21:13,473 --> 00:21:16,309
Charlie, i'm
up the creek.

228
00:21:16,343 --> 00:21:19,479
Flat. Zippo.

229
00:21:19,512 --> 00:21:22,382
How 'bout it?
Is it a bet?

230
00:21:24,317 --> 00:21:28,120
I'll tell you what,
Hank.
Huh?

231
00:21:28,154 --> 00:21:30,156
I got a better bet
for ya.

232
00:21:30,189 --> 00:21:35,495
What's that?
Any team that can go
from zero to seven wins...

233
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:37,830
Can go from zero
to the super bowl.

234
00:21:37,864 --> 00:21:41,200
The super bowl?
The bet was
your idea, Hank.

235
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:43,470
If you wanna hang on
to your team--

236
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:47,674
- the super bowl?
- I'll refinance you
for one year.

237
00:21:47,707 --> 00:21:53,380
You have to get
to the super bowl and win it
or you lose the team.

238
00:21:53,413 --> 00:21:57,384
Ch-Charlie,
I wanna hang on to that team,
but you're diggin' my grave.

239
00:21:57,417 --> 00:22:00,219
Hank.
What are friends for?

240
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:04,691
Hi, Andy.
How do you like
lukom's ranch?

241
00:22:04,724 --> 00:22:07,193
Very much.
It reminds me
of home.

242
00:22:07,226 --> 00:22:10,196
Well, a letter
from yugoslavia
came to the office.

243
00:22:10,229 --> 00:22:12,865
My family!
Maybe papa got
the clipping.

244
00:22:12,899 --> 00:22:15,334
Oh, boy, I bet
they're proud of you.

245
00:22:17,236 --> 00:22:19,406
Oh, could I have
the stamp?
Sure.

246
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:27,480
Bad news?
Good news, about
my brother, stjepan,

247
00:22:27,514 --> 00:22:30,383
and papa says that
he played brilliantly
against Brazil.

248
00:22:30,417 --> 00:22:35,087
Stjepan kicked
four goals and won
the game single-handed.

249
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:39,859
That's great, but wh--
where does it mention you?

250
00:22:41,928 --> 00:22:44,263
In the p.S.

251
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:47,333
"We received your
newspaper clipping
but could not read it...

252
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,335
"Because of the caviar
that was spilled on it...

253
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:52,104
During stjepan's
victory celebration."

254
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:55,808
Same old papa.

255
00:22:56,909 --> 00:22:58,845
Isn't there
something I could do?

256
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:01,047
How about writing you
a cheerful letter?

257
00:23:02,415 --> 00:23:06,453
Or maybe going
out to dinner
with me tonight?

258
00:23:06,486 --> 00:23:09,856
Ohh. I made a date
with Rob.

259
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:13,192
- Oh.
- You know, I haven't
seen him very much lately,

260
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,094
and I just don't know how
I could break it.

261
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:19,265
- Yeah. I understand.
- Otherwise I'd love to.

262
00:23:19,298 --> 00:23:20,933
Yeah.

263
00:23:22,268 --> 00:23:26,238
Gus! What is it?

264
00:23:26,272 --> 00:23:28,107
I'll call the vet
and cancel
the date with Rob.

265
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,609
Oh, no, no. You go ahead.
I'll take care of it.

266
00:23:29,642 --> 00:23:32,812
Don't be silly.
If Gus is sick,
I want to be here.

267
00:23:34,313 --> 00:23:36,516
It's okay. You'll be okay.

268
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:42,822
I'd like to say
I cured him,

269
00:23:42,855 --> 00:23:45,124
but this mule's
healthy as a horse.

270
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:46,292
I'll see you folks.

271
00:23:46,325 --> 00:23:49,328
It was like a miracle
that he recovered.

272
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:51,163
Yes.

273
00:23:51,197 --> 00:23:54,967
You know, in my country,
when a dinner date
is canceled, it's canceled.

274
00:23:55,001 --> 00:23:57,504
I think I like
your customs.

275
00:23:57,537 --> 00:23:59,138
And your miracles.

276
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:08,581
I don't believe it. That Debbie
stood me up for two hours in
front of a Chinese restaurant.

277
00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:11,250
And I don't even like
Chinese food!

278
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:15,988
Hey, she called and asked me
to give you a message, but
I didn't know where you'd gone.

279
00:24:16,022 --> 00:24:19,659
Said something about
Gus the mule being sick
and her taking care of him.

280
00:24:19,692 --> 00:24:24,497
Gus the mule?
I got that Yugoslav
comin' outta my ears.

281
00:24:24,531 --> 00:24:26,833
Hello. Is Debbie there?

282
00:24:26,866 --> 00:24:29,969
- No, she isn't.
- Where is she?
Out back with the mule?

283
00:24:30,002 --> 00:24:34,473
No, she's out with Andy.
Left for the drive-in movie
about an hour ago.

284
00:24:34,507 --> 00:24:39,311
- Any message?
- Yeah, but I'll
deliver it myself.

285
00:25:17,584 --> 00:25:22,354
Debbie? Debbie,
would you mind
steppin' out?

286
00:25:22,388 --> 00:25:25,491
Debbie, I know
you're in there.

287
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:29,696
All right, if you
won't come out, then
I'm comin' in. Aah.

288
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:35,434
I thought
we had a da--
i-- sorry.

289
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,442
I am really sorry.

290
00:25:46,746 --> 00:25:49,381
Oh, boy,
am I sorry.

291
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:53,219
* oh, say, does that

292
00:25:53,252 --> 00:25:57,757
* star-spangled banner

293
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:02,962
* yet wave

294
00:26:02,995 --> 00:26:09,035
* o'er the land of the free

295
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:14,807
* and the home of the brave

296
00:26:17,476 --> 00:26:21,113
it's the home of the brave, all
right. Can't be more than a
handful of people here tonight.

297
00:26:21,147 --> 00:26:23,249
Well, we saw what
the fans thought of the mule.

298
00:26:23,282 --> 00:26:25,652
Now I guess we're seeing
what they think of the team.

299
00:26:25,685 --> 00:26:28,955
This is Johnny unitas,
and here's my good
friend and cohort--

300
00:26:28,988 --> 00:26:31,557
well, howdy there,
football fans.
You, too, mother.

301
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,326
Pepper Allen here.
Just down on the field
collecting some stats.

302
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,963
And it's just about
kickoff time.

303
00:26:36,996 --> 00:26:39,498
Time to welcome
the old pepper pot
into your living rooms...

304
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:43,335
For another season of
great, great football
on football night of the week.

305
00:26:43,369 --> 00:26:48,340
Week after week,
I'll be with ya, step by step,
name by name, game by game,

306
00:26:48,374 --> 00:26:51,978
and, of course, sittin'
right here beside me, I'll have
my old buddy Johnny unitas.

307
00:26:52,011 --> 00:26:55,581
He'll be carryin' the ball
right along with me,
right, John? Right.

308
00:26:55,614 --> 00:27:00,352
But don't you worry, fans.
The old pepper pot will be right
here to fall on any fumbles.

309
00:27:00,386 --> 00:27:04,691
Yeah, we're gonna
be watchin' a very interesting
team here tonight, folks,

310
00:27:04,724 --> 00:27:07,927
'cause this atom ball club
has nowhere to go but up!

311
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:12,464
I mean, it's a team that, during
the entire exhibition season,
they didn't win a single game!

312
00:27:12,498 --> 00:27:16,268
Strike that!
They didn't score
a single touchdown.

313
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:19,806
Strike that!
Couldn't buy
a single point.

314
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:24,343
And if you can't go up from
there, football fans, I don't
know where you can go up from.

315
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:26,345
Right, Johnny?
Right.

316
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:29,181
Hey, have we got some
interesting match-ups
for you tonight.

317
00:27:29,215 --> 00:27:32,785
Through the magic of
pepper's profiles, i'm
gonna give you an insight...

318
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:36,222
On some of the players
who'll be makin' it happen
right down there on the field.

319
00:27:36,255 --> 00:27:39,125
Would you roll
that film, please,
back there?

320
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:41,360
Excuse me, pepper.
They're about to kick off.

321
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:43,229
Who? Oh!

322
00:27:43,262 --> 00:27:45,364
The green bay packers, folks.
They're lining up.

323
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:46,733
And we're ready to go.

324
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:54,240
Roy really got his toe
into that one. Right
in and out of the end zone.

325
00:27:54,273 --> 00:27:57,209
Yeah! The atoms
get the first break
of the ball game.

326
00:27:57,243 --> 00:28:01,047
They don't have
to run it back!

327
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:05,651
All right, offense!
Offense! Get in there
and stick it to 'em!

328
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:10,089
Yeah, you don't have to be a
Johnny unitas to know that the
only chance those atoms have...

329
00:28:10,122 --> 00:28:11,590
Is to pass that ball,
right, Johnny?

330
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:13,860
Right. Take it
from the old pepper.

331
00:28:13,893 --> 00:28:15,895
Now, if I were that
quarterback, i-I'd
come right out throwin'!

332
00:28:15,928 --> 00:28:18,831
Throw, throw,
throw!

333
00:28:18,865 --> 00:28:22,701
Four! 68! Hut!

334
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:26,438
They came out throwing,
all right.

335
00:28:26,472 --> 00:28:29,675
They got thrown back
for four yards,
making it second and 14.

336
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:33,412
Get set!
53! 41! Hut!

337
00:28:46,425 --> 00:28:50,797
Ellis is dropping back. Looks
like they're taking your advice,
pepper. They're gonna pass.

338
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:53,565
Oh, no!

339
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:56,969
Well, it's fourth down and 18.
I guess we better punt.

340
00:28:57,003 --> 00:29:00,139
Hold it!
Uh, you don't want
to punt, Mr. Cooper?

341
00:29:00,172 --> 00:29:03,475
We're going for
the field goal, coach.
From our own 12 yard line?

342
00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:07,146
If o'brien turned around
and kicked the other way, he
couldn't make a field goal.

343
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:10,749
It's a field goal,
coach.

344
00:29:12,318 --> 00:29:15,454
Yeah, but wha--

345
00:29:20,126 --> 00:29:22,461
uh-oh. A little
confusion down there.

346
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:25,164
The mule has romped
onto the field.

347
00:29:30,302 --> 00:29:31,971
You're gonna do what?

348
00:29:32,004 --> 00:29:35,741
Mr. Cooper's orders.
Someone throws me
the ball, and I hold it.

349
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:39,245
Then Gus kicks it,
and then we score
a touchdown.

350
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:43,983
Not a touchdown,
you yugoslavian midget.
A field goal. Three points?

351
00:29:44,016 --> 00:29:47,319
If they're crazy enough
to let us get away with it.

352
00:29:47,353 --> 00:29:50,156
Now you're gonna
have to get that mule
off the field, Mr. Cooper,

353
00:29:50,189 --> 00:29:51,824
unless you wanna
forfeit the game.

354
00:29:51,858 --> 00:29:54,426
Oh, no, we don't want
to forfeit the game,
do we, Mr. Cooper?

355
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:57,163
We're not
forfeiting
anything.

356
00:29:57,196 --> 00:30:00,299
The mule
stays in,
and he kicks.

357
00:30:02,701 --> 00:30:04,871
There's no way
they're gonna let
that mule kick.

358
00:30:04,904 --> 00:30:09,208
The referee is talking
to someone on the
field phone, pepper.

359
00:30:09,241 --> 00:30:13,012
Johnny, please, stick with
the money, John. Was the old
pepper pot ever wrong?

360
00:30:13,045 --> 00:30:16,782
Take it from me.
If the atoms think they're
going to let that mule kick,

361
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,717
it's pie in the sky,
and I never lie!

362
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,686
Heh-heh, there's
just no way!

363
00:30:20,719 --> 00:30:23,389
How 'bout this way--
there's no way!

364
00:30:23,422 --> 00:30:27,793
Ladies
and gentlemen, may I have
your attention, please?

365
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,695
I have been asked
to read a bulletin.

366
00:30:29,728 --> 00:30:32,831
According to
the official rules of
the national football league,

367
00:30:32,865 --> 00:30:34,666
rule 5, section 1,

368
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:38,637
the game is to be
played by two teams
of 11 players each.

369
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,406
The rule book does not
define the word "player."

370
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:43,809
Therefore, a player
could be a man, a woman...

371
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:46,378
Or anyone a team chooses
to represent them on the field.

372
00:30:46,412 --> 00:30:51,683
And so, ladies and
gentlemen, the mule "Gus"
will be allowed to play.

373
00:30:51,717 --> 00:30:56,855
And as you say, pepper,
"there's no way."

374
00:31:12,404 --> 00:31:13,705
Oich!

375
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,580
*

376
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:38,264
Hank, that mule
was a cheap trick.

377
00:31:38,297 --> 00:31:41,633
What trick? You shoved
an impossible bet up my armpit.

378
00:31:41,667 --> 00:31:44,570
- I stuck you with a mule.
- Well, you'll never get
away with it, Hank.

379
00:31:44,603 --> 00:31:47,739
You wouldn't like to make
a little bet on that, too,
would you, Charlie?

380
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:55,714
Another beautiful evening
here in Adams stadium
and another capacity crowd.

381
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:58,717
The fans in these parts
have gone bananas.

382
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,253
Four weeks into the season,
and who is undefeated,

383
00:32:01,287 --> 00:32:03,755
and who's in a tie
for first place
in the western division?

384
00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:07,893
Yes, sir, our own
astounding California atoms.

385
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,896
Now let's go
down to the field
for the introductions.

386
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:14,133
At 229, number 50,

387
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:17,403
Fred stillwell.

388
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:21,073
*
at 235, number 61,

389
00:32:21,107 --> 00:32:22,908
Marvin schnall.

390
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:25,511
*
at 250, number 57,

391
00:32:25,544 --> 00:32:27,946
- Rob cargil.
- *

392
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:31,950
and weighing in
at 1,374 pounds,

393
00:32:31,984 --> 00:32:35,687
number double zero,
Gus Petrovic.

394
00:32:35,721 --> 00:32:39,125
*

395
00:32:39,158 --> 00:32:40,659
*

396
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:43,862
all right, men,
this is another
tough one.

397
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:46,698
I want you
to get out there
and stick it right to 'em.

398
00:32:48,134 --> 00:32:51,537
This is a 40-man team,
and I want a 40-man effort.

399
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:56,275
- Are you with me?
- Yeah!

400
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:05,684
Here comes the atoms'
third-down play.

401
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:08,620
Ellis is back to pass.
Receivers are well-covered.
He looks, he looks--

402
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:11,023
oh, he's smothered.
It's another big loss,

403
00:33:11,057 --> 00:33:14,293
and listen to those
atoms fans cheer!

404
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:16,695
Never heard a team cheered
for losing ground before,

405
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:19,065
but you're going
to be hearing it
all evening, folks,

406
00:33:19,098 --> 00:33:24,636
'cause with fourth and 24
on their own nine yard line,
here comes the reason.

407
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:27,739
Go get 'em, Gus!

408
00:33:33,912 --> 00:33:35,547
Ready, Gus?

409
00:33:39,285 --> 00:33:41,387
Oich!

410
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:49,361
*

411
00:33:49,395 --> 00:33:51,697
*

412
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,935
that's the way
to go, Andy!

413
00:34:05,611 --> 00:34:07,446
San Francisco's ball,
good field position.

414
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:09,448
Remember, Tucker
likes to throw the ball.

415
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,618
Yes, he's back to pass.
It looks. Like a screen

416
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:18,023
and cargil is
over fast to cover.

417
00:34:24,263 --> 00:34:27,799
Kid. Kid!
Say somethin'.

418
00:34:29,768 --> 00:34:32,771
I did it
all for you, papa.

419
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:42,681
*

420
00:34:46,852 --> 00:34:49,321
here comes Gus
trotting out
on the field once again.

421
00:34:49,355 --> 00:34:52,824
The question now is,
who is going
to hold for him?

422
00:34:56,762 --> 00:34:59,131
I have seen everything.

423
00:34:59,165 --> 00:35:02,100
I've seen many players
carried off the field
on stretchers, folks,

424
00:35:02,134 --> 00:35:04,703
but I've never seen
anything like this.

425
00:35:16,648 --> 00:35:18,284
Oich.

426
00:35:23,189 --> 00:35:24,623
*

427
00:35:30,496 --> 00:35:33,999
Cargil! Cargil!

428
00:35:36,535 --> 00:35:38,837
Cargil!

429
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:41,673
You-- you're
trying to ruin me.

430
00:35:41,707 --> 00:35:43,475
I saw what happened!
It was a deliberate hit.

431
00:35:43,509 --> 00:35:45,677
Mr. Cooper, I'm tellin' ya.
It was an accident.

432
00:35:45,711 --> 00:35:49,047
Then it's
a $1,000 accident, because
that's what it's costin' ya.

433
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,318
One thousand dollars.

434
00:35:52,351 --> 00:35:54,320
And a new suit!

435
00:35:55,854 --> 00:35:57,856
And a box of cigars!

436
00:36:03,429 --> 00:36:06,832
Don't worry.
Cal, they've won
four in a row.

437
00:36:06,865 --> 00:36:09,901
They're tied
for first place!
Relax, will you?

438
00:36:09,935 --> 00:36:13,539
What chance have they got
to get to the super bowl
anyway?

439
00:36:13,572 --> 00:36:17,309
What chance?
With that four-legged George blanda kicking field goals,

440
00:36:17,343 --> 00:36:19,545
it is a definite possibility!

441
00:36:19,578 --> 00:36:23,882
All right. So what
we need is an edge.

442
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:25,884
You got somethin'
in mind?

443
00:36:28,887 --> 00:36:31,257
I'll work on it.

444
00:36:43,569 --> 00:36:48,073
Spinner, crankcase, I've
spent ten years of my life
observing you two men.

445
00:36:48,106 --> 00:36:50,108
I've seen you
come in together
and go out together.

446
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:53,779
I've seen you
come back in together
and go back out together,

447
00:36:53,812 --> 00:36:54,780
and I've seen you
come back in--

448
00:36:54,813 --> 00:36:56,582
yeah, yeah, warden.
We know.

449
00:36:56,615 --> 00:36:59,885
You seen us
come in together, and you
seen us go back out together.

450
00:36:59,918 --> 00:37:04,290
For the last time!
We're splittin' up.

451
00:37:04,323 --> 00:37:06,525
Well, I'm delighted.

452
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:10,161
Then I wish you gentlemen
both a happier
and healthier tomorrow.

453
00:37:11,663 --> 00:37:14,400
Thank you, warden.
Good luck.

454
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:08,687
Slayko, Lester slayko. Sports
columnist for united press
international, Mr. Lukom?

455
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,289
We thought
there'd be a nice, warm
human interest story...

456
00:38:11,323 --> 00:38:15,160
About the ranch where
Gus the mule is staying.

457
00:38:15,193 --> 00:38:19,431
And of course about
the man who boards him.

458
00:38:19,465 --> 00:38:24,269
Oh, good, good. Well, now,
would you mind if I asked you
a couple of questions?

459
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:29,207
Oh, good, good.
Now, I gather that Gus
sleeps in a barn. Hmm?

460
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:34,145
His own stall?
With security,
I assume?

461
00:38:34,179 --> 00:38:37,383
No security as yet.
Uh-huh.

462
00:38:37,416 --> 00:38:40,886
Now, do you drive him
to the stadium
before the game?

463
00:38:40,919 --> 00:38:44,723
Gordon horse vans.

464
00:38:44,756 --> 00:38:46,892
Uh-huh.

465
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:56,435
Yeah, now, th-that's,
uh, g-o-r-d-o-n?

466
00:38:57,903 --> 00:39:01,239
Yeah.
Capital g-o-r--

467
00:39:11,116 --> 00:39:15,253
Wow. That's
the famous mule, huh?

468
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:16,822
Well, I heard a lot
about ya, Andy--

469
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:19,591
oh, no, I'm Andy.
This is Gus.

470
00:39:19,625 --> 00:39:24,496
Oh. Ye-- yah, well--
oh, well, pardon me. I'm not
too good at names or faces.

471
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:26,331
Have you
driven us before?

472
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:29,701
No, I just got out.
I mean, uh, to these parts.

473
00:39:29,735 --> 00:39:31,937
Yeah. No.

474
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:35,106
Well, y-you do know
the way to the stadium.
Oh, sure, sure, sure.

475
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:37,943
I'll get you there
in plenty of time for the game.
Yeah. I know a shortcut.

476
00:39:37,976 --> 00:39:41,212
It's gonna be all right.
Uh, wanna load him up?

477
00:40:01,299 --> 00:40:03,569
Can't figure it out.
That shortcut disappeared.

478
00:40:03,602 --> 00:40:06,738
Perhaps if we took
the longcut it wouldn't
use so much gasoline.

479
00:40:06,772 --> 00:40:08,940
Oh, you're
a worrier, kid.

480
00:40:08,974 --> 00:40:12,811
By game time, you and I
will be there watchin'
that mule in action.

481
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:28,259
Uh, Mr. Cooper?
Mr. Lukom said they left
about three hours ago.

482
00:40:28,293 --> 00:40:30,729
By dog sled?
Well, maybe they got caught
in a traffic jam.

483
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:34,800
Joe, they could have
been here three hours ago
if Gus had ridden in on Andy.

484
00:40:34,833 --> 00:40:37,636
Yeah, you were right
about the gas, but I was
right about the mule.

485
00:40:37,669 --> 00:40:40,606
It's game time, and
we're watchin' him
in action.

486
00:40:43,308 --> 00:40:46,978
Did ya hear about what
happened yesterday, Charlie?
Yeah, Hank.

487
00:40:47,012 --> 00:40:50,816
It's a shame.
Mule missed the
whole game, huh?

488
00:40:50,849 --> 00:40:54,953
Yeah. Yeah!
It was the darndest thing!

489
00:40:54,986 --> 00:40:58,857
Seems like somebody
slipped in a phony driver.

490
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:00,458
Oh, Hank,
deliberately?

491
00:41:00,492 --> 00:41:03,762
Now, aren't you exaggerating
just a little bit?

492
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:07,699
Maybe I am, Charlie,
but I tell you this:

493
00:41:07,733 --> 00:41:12,638
If it happens again,
whoever did it is going to get
his tail full of buckshot.

494
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:16,508
Men, this is a proud team.

495
00:41:16,542 --> 00:41:19,377
This season, we've won
four times together.

496
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:21,647
Now, last week,
we went down together,

497
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:25,450
but the Mark of a great team
is whether they can
come back together!

498
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:28,353
Yeah!
All right!

499
00:41:28,386 --> 00:41:30,488
Now, first place
is waitin' for us, men.

500
00:41:30,522 --> 00:41:33,491
So this week,
we're gonna get off the ground,

501
00:41:33,525 --> 00:41:36,361
and we're gonna go out there
and we're gonna win together!

502
00:41:36,394 --> 00:41:39,397
Are you with me?

503
00:41:50,776 --> 00:41:53,545
Oich!

504
00:42:09,761 --> 00:42:13,264
Let's count our blessings.

505
00:42:13,298 --> 00:42:17,402
In a world sagging under the
burden of war, energy crisis,

506
00:42:17,435 --> 00:42:20,906
bigotry, overpopulation,
crime and inflation,

507
00:42:20,939 --> 00:42:24,743
it's a comfort
to have Andy and Gus.

508
00:42:24,776 --> 00:42:26,845
The mule is a winner!

509
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:29,380
He's something we need
in our daily life.

510
00:42:29,414 --> 00:42:34,519
If he hadn't just happened,
we would have had to invent
him.

511
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:37,288
For man needs hope...

512
00:42:37,322 --> 00:42:39,791
And the assurance
that somehow, some way,

513
00:42:39,825 --> 00:42:42,360
things are going to work out
for the better--

514
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:45,597
that we're all
going to be winners!

515
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:49,901
And it's taken a simple
mule from yugoslavia...

516
00:42:49,935 --> 00:42:54,439
To make this
American dream come true
for the California atoms,

517
00:42:54,472 --> 00:42:59,978
who are now ten and one
and tied for first place
in the western division.

518
00:43:00,011 --> 00:43:02,580
And how would you like
to meet the young man
who, with his mule,

519
00:43:02,614 --> 00:43:06,217
has helped bring
the peoples of these
two great countries,

520
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:09,120
America
and yugoslavia, together?

521
00:43:09,154 --> 00:43:12,624
Our candidates for
goodwill ambassadors
of the year:

522
00:43:12,658 --> 00:43:15,961
Gus and his co-hero,
Andy Petrovic.

523
00:43:15,994 --> 00:43:20,565
Andy, you've
captured the heart
and the imagination...

524
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,768
Of all America.

525
00:43:24,836 --> 00:43:27,272
I feel very proud.

526
00:43:27,305 --> 00:43:32,243
I would like to thank
Mr. Hank Cooper and everyone
else who has helped me,

527
00:43:32,277 --> 00:43:36,347
and most of all,
I would like
to thank Gus.

528
00:43:36,381 --> 00:43:39,350
Andy, we have
a surprise for you.

529
00:43:39,384 --> 00:43:41,486
Through the magic of telstar,

530
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:45,323
we are going to take you back
to a small farm in yugoslavia,

531
00:43:45,356 --> 00:43:49,160
where a proud family is waiting
to be reunited with you.

532
00:43:49,194 --> 00:43:51,997
Come in, yugoslavia!

533
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:56,201
- Andy!
- Mama! Papa!

534
00:43:56,234 --> 00:43:59,805
It must make you very proud
to have a son who's a hero
like Andy, Mr. Petrovic.

535
00:44:02,407 --> 00:44:04,609
I don't understand.
What hero?

536
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:08,546
The mule kicks,
and Andy holds
the ball.

537
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:10,648
A finger
is a hero?

538
00:44:10,682 --> 00:44:12,517
You want
to see a hero?

539
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:15,286
I'll show you
a hero. Hah!

540
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,855
My brother, stjepan.

541
00:44:16,888 --> 00:44:21,359
The greatest
soccer player
in all of Europe.

542
00:44:21,392 --> 00:44:25,230
Fine, but this is
a salute to Andy
and-- and Gus.

543
00:44:25,263 --> 00:44:29,067
Good. While you're
saluting a finger,

544
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:32,670
maybe also you
should salute
a hero!

545
00:44:35,373 --> 00:44:37,843
Uh, well, thank you for the
visit, Mr. and Mrs. Petrovic.

546
00:44:39,911 --> 00:44:43,481
What soccer is
to the rest of the world,
football is to America.

547
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:49,721
And we can all pay tribute
to these newly crowned American
heroes tomorrow-- sunday--

548
00:44:49,755 --> 00:44:52,924
now officially
called "Gus day."

549
00:44:52,958 --> 00:44:57,729
And as we cheer for Gus
tomorrow, we'll be cheering...

550
00:44:57,763 --> 00:45:01,499
For the mule in all of us.

551
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:04,402
A privilege to meet you,
inspector Henderson.

552
00:45:04,435 --> 00:45:07,272
May I ask the reason
for the visit?

553
00:45:07,305 --> 00:45:10,608
Just wanted to make sure
your boys are on their toes,
that's all.

554
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:13,278
We pembertons
are never off them, sir.

555
00:45:13,311 --> 00:45:15,513
We have Gus
secured in his stable,

556
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:18,683
all ready for
his big night tonight.

557
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:22,587
Well, then, captain, perhaps
you have an explanation
for that, huh?

558
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:24,422
Huh? Huh?

559
00:45:27,058 --> 00:45:29,795
Men!

560
00:45:53,985 --> 00:45:55,353
Shh!

561
00:46:24,682 --> 00:46:28,353
Drink up, Gus.
Today's your day.

562
00:46:30,889 --> 00:46:36,694
*

563
00:46:39,197 --> 00:46:45,136
welcome, ladies and
gentlemen, to the biggest
celebration of the year.

564
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:49,174
It looks like the whole city
has turned out to honor
its favorite two citizens.

565
00:46:49,207 --> 00:46:53,845
I've never seen anything
like it. This stadium is
rocking with Gus fans!

566
00:46:53,879 --> 00:46:56,848
And let me tell ya.
The spirit is catching, folks.

567
00:46:56,882 --> 00:47:00,185
And I do mean catching.

568
00:47:00,218 --> 00:47:02,453
Well, there are dignitaries
from all over the state.

569
00:47:02,487 --> 00:47:04,956
They've come here
for the pre-game ceremony.

570
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:08,826
Let's see. There's the
honorable mayor, Tom Lansing,
and his lovely wife, Loretta,

571
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:13,231
and representatives
of boy and girl scouts...

572
00:47:15,934 --> 00:47:19,270
And our own
beauteous atomettes.

573
00:47:22,073 --> 00:47:24,375
Let's see. That roar
from the crowd can mean
only one thing, folks.

574
00:47:24,409 --> 00:47:29,014
*
yes, here comes Andy and Gus
in their proudest moment.

575
00:48:17,095 --> 00:48:19,630
Come on, Gus.
Shape up.

576
00:48:33,144 --> 00:48:37,082
Let's see. The mayor
is now stepping forward
to make the presentation.

577
00:48:43,288 --> 00:48:46,891
Whoa! Help!
Someone, help!

578
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:51,997
- Gus!
- Wha--
help! Get me up, somebody!

579
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:53,664
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa!

580
00:49:04,809 --> 00:49:08,980
- Gus!
- Stop! Stop!

581
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:13,451
Whoa!

582
00:49:13,484 --> 00:49:17,422
Come back, Gus!

583
00:49:33,671 --> 00:49:35,873
Aah!

584
00:49:46,384 --> 00:49:50,321
Well, we're set to go, folks.
The eagles have won the toss,
and Gus will kick off...

585
00:49:50,355 --> 00:49:54,359
And if Gus plays with
half the spirit he's shown
during the pregame ceremonies,

586
00:49:54,392 --> 00:49:56,827
watch out, eagles!

587
00:50:00,198 --> 00:50:01,932
Oich!

588
00:50:13,578 --> 00:50:17,182
Tsk. Shame to see ya drop
to second place, Hank.

589
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:19,450
What happened to the mule?
Was he sick or what?

590
00:50:20,585 --> 00:50:23,488
You know darn well
what happened.

591
00:50:23,521 --> 00:50:27,858
We ran his oats
through a lab and made
an interesting discovery.

592
00:50:27,892 --> 00:50:29,894
How'd ya like to try
a few of those oats,
Charlie?

593
00:50:29,927 --> 00:50:32,230
Or don't ya drink
before breakfast?

594
00:50:32,263 --> 00:50:37,535
Well, all I know is I've got
a friend who has problems,

595
00:50:37,568 --> 00:50:38,903
so I came here
with an olive branch.

596
00:50:40,471 --> 00:50:42,940
Whaddya got on it,
arsenic?

597
00:50:42,973 --> 00:50:46,010
Hank, I'm meeting
the other offers
for the team--

598
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:47,912
if you sell right now.

599
00:50:47,945 --> 00:50:50,915
Your offer couldn't have
been better timed, Charlie.

600
00:50:50,948 --> 00:50:55,720
- Now I know you're sweatin'.
- Hank, you're playing with
a cold deck.

601
00:50:55,753 --> 00:50:57,755
Come on.
How about it?

602
00:50:57,788 --> 00:51:01,459
Sorry, Charlie.
There's an old
yugoslavian expression.

603
00:51:01,492 --> 00:51:04,562
Never switch mules
in the middle
of a shave.

604
00:51:12,603 --> 00:51:16,907
Well, the atoms really
showed 'em how it's done
here in buffalo today, folks.

605
00:51:16,941 --> 00:51:19,744
It was Gus 30, the bills 27.

606
00:51:19,777 --> 00:51:24,549
That moves the California club
into a first-place tie with
the rams, who lost today,

607
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:27,285
and it sets up the really
big one for next week,

608
00:51:27,318 --> 00:51:30,888
when the atoms play
those same Los Angeles rams
for the divisional title.

609
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:33,791
Incidentally, for wives
and sweethearts who want
to meet the team,

610
00:51:33,824 --> 00:51:37,462
the atoms' plane will arrive
at 10:30 tonight in Los Angeles.

611
00:51:44,469 --> 00:51:47,505
How are you?

612
00:52:12,163 --> 00:52:14,432
Oich!

613
00:52:18,336 --> 00:52:21,672
Two things happened
to Rob cargil, the atoms'
star linebacker today:

614
00:52:21,706 --> 00:52:25,376
He went to the hospital, and he
went to the Michigan mammoths.

615
00:52:25,410 --> 00:52:28,879
Too late to help 'em much
this year, even if they
make it to the super bowl,

616
00:52:28,913 --> 00:52:30,981
unless you make tackles
from a wheelchair.

617
00:52:31,015 --> 00:52:34,519
The rumor is that Rob was
the third side of one of those
eternal triangles,

618
00:52:34,552 --> 00:52:38,456
and there's been
bad blood between him
and Andy Petrovic all season.

619
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:41,526
As for Andy,
he hasn't got a problem
in the world these days,

620
00:52:41,559 --> 00:52:46,030
as he and Gus lead the atoms
into the divisional
title game this sunday.

621
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:50,034
Yes, this is he
speaking.

622
00:52:50,067 --> 00:52:53,238
This is memorial hospital,
Mr. Petrovic.

623
00:52:53,271 --> 00:52:57,242
Yes?
I've been instructed to call you
by a miss Debbie kovacs.

624
00:52:57,275 --> 00:52:59,710
Debbie?
Uh, what's happened
to Debbie?

625
00:52:59,744 --> 00:53:04,014
Well, there's been
an accident, but she's
in very good hands.

626
00:53:04,048 --> 00:53:07,151
- Uh, who is this?
- I'm Dr. Ernest Goldman.

627
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:10,388
See, it was
a two-car collision.
What a mess!

628
00:53:10,421 --> 00:53:13,391
But you're not to worry.
Those were her very words.

629
00:53:13,424 --> 00:53:17,728
She knows you got a crucial game
to play today, and she wants
you shouldn't miss it.

630
00:53:17,762 --> 00:53:20,398
Uh, where is
memorial hospital?

631
00:53:20,431 --> 00:53:25,403
- Oh, you're not to come
down here, sir.
- H-how do I find the hospital?

632
00:53:25,436 --> 00:53:28,172
You take
the Santa Ana freeway
to the orange grove off-ramp.

633
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:31,642
Turn left at beach boulevard
about four miles.
Then take a right.

634
00:53:33,644 --> 00:53:37,315
Dr. Wylie. Dr. Wylie.
Call surgery.

635
00:53:42,587 --> 00:53:45,022
Mr. Petrovic?
Dr. Goldman?

636
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:49,294
- Right this way, please.
- Dr. Danbry. Call x ray.

637
00:53:58,303 --> 00:54:00,738
Now if you'll notice
right here, the--

638
00:54:00,771 --> 00:54:03,941
I couldn't expect
a layman like you
to be able to read this,

639
00:54:03,974 --> 00:54:06,977
but, uh,
to the practiced eye,
it's quite obvious.

640
00:54:07,011 --> 00:54:11,316
Now, you see the pressure
in the ventricular globule
in the tertiary gland?

641
00:54:11,349 --> 00:54:15,420
Well, that's causing an
obstruction in the, uh,
lumbar columbado region.

642
00:54:15,453 --> 00:54:17,021
Ohh.

643
00:54:24,495 --> 00:54:27,632
Uh, ahem,
room's ready, doctor.
Thank you, doctor.

644
00:54:27,665 --> 00:54:32,770
Dr. Deloo. Dr. Deloo.
Call inhalation therapy.

645
00:54:32,803 --> 00:54:34,439
Oh, where's Debbie?
She's fine.

646
00:54:34,472 --> 00:54:36,907
Right now, she
needs an immediate
blood transfusion.

647
00:54:36,941 --> 00:54:39,243
What type blood
you got?
Uh, i-I'm not sure.

648
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:41,512
Perfect. Just
the kind she needs.
Here you are.

649
00:54:41,546 --> 00:54:43,648
Change into these.
Wait here.
I'll be right back.

650
00:54:43,681 --> 00:54:47,017
- But, Dr. Goldman, i--
- I said I'll be right back.

651
00:54:50,821 --> 00:54:54,091
What do you mean
he isn't with ya?
We just brought the mule.

652
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:57,194
We thought Andy
was with you.
You thought?

653
00:54:57,227 --> 00:54:59,664
You thought?
I hired you guys
for muscle.

654
00:54:59,697 --> 00:55:02,733
If I wanted somebody
to think, I'd have hired
the supreme court!

655
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:12,977
Oh, how's Debbie?

656
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:15,179
I've been waiting here
for the transfusion,
but nobody's come in.

657
00:55:15,212 --> 00:55:17,815
Patience, Patience,
my boy. Everything's
going along perfectly.

658
00:55:17,848 --> 00:55:21,852
She sent you a message.
She said, "everything's
going along perfectly.

659
00:55:21,886 --> 00:55:24,188
Just knowing you're here
eases the pain."

660
00:55:24,221 --> 00:55:27,024
Oh, if only I could see her!
Will you relax,
Sonny boy?

661
00:55:27,057 --> 00:55:30,795
You'll get your blood all
bubbly, and that wouldn't do you
any good for the transfusion.

662
00:55:30,828 --> 00:55:35,332
Where are you taking those?
Well, I'm taking these
to the transfusion room.

663
00:55:35,366 --> 00:55:37,368
You see, the minute
you're finished, you just
slide off the table,

664
00:55:37,402 --> 00:55:40,070
slip into these
and you're on your way
to the game.

665
00:55:44,409 --> 00:55:47,645
You keep your eye on
'im while I dump these.

666
00:55:47,678 --> 00:55:49,547
What if somebody
wants to come in?

667
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:53,518
Tell 'em ya got an
extreme case of
dementia praecox in there.

668
00:55:53,551 --> 00:55:54,752
What kind of peacock?

669
00:55:54,785 --> 00:55:56,687
You know--

670
00:55:56,721 --> 00:55:59,023
oh, you mean
the peacock's cuckoo?

671
00:56:00,224 --> 00:56:02,660
Dr. Gray. Dr. Gray--

672
00:56:02,693 --> 00:56:07,364
excuse me.
Uh, Mr. Cooper?
I just heard from Andy.

673
00:56:07,398 --> 00:56:09,400
Where is he?
Well, there's been
some kind of emergency.

674
00:56:09,434 --> 00:56:11,802
He said he'd be here
as soon as he gives
Debbie a transfusion.

675
00:56:13,938 --> 00:56:16,907
Does that girl look like
she needs a transfusion?

676
00:56:16,941 --> 00:56:18,943
Oh, uh, no.
No, no, not at all.

677
00:56:18,976 --> 00:56:21,512
You--
great shape!

678
00:56:21,546 --> 00:56:26,584
Dr. Terussa. Call radiology.
Uh, excuse me.
You can't go in there.

679
00:56:26,617 --> 00:56:30,087
- Pardon me.
- Oh, no. You see, we have
a demented peacock in there.

680
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:32,523
- A what?
- Uh, uh, a, uh---

681
00:56:32,557 --> 00:56:36,927
what about my transfusion?
I have to hurry. I'm playing
a very important football game.

682
00:56:36,961 --> 00:56:40,097
Football? Oh, sure, yeah.
I'll tell ya what. Why don't we
bring the goalposts here, Gus?

683
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:44,735
Oh, no. No, i-I'm not Gus.
I'm Andy. You must believe me.
We do.

684
00:56:44,769 --> 00:56:47,772
Yeah, we do. Yeah. Sure,
you can be anybody you want
here. Man o' war, rin tin tin.

685
00:56:47,805 --> 00:56:51,408
How about dumbo,
the flying elephant?

686
00:56:51,442 --> 00:56:53,778
Hasn't got both oars
in the water.

687
00:56:53,811 --> 00:56:55,980
Mm-hmm.

688
00:56:58,516 --> 00:57:01,719
It's fourth down, Mr. Cooper.
Guess we oughta punt, huh?
Excuse me.

689
00:57:01,752 --> 00:57:04,589
I've checked every hospital
in town, Mr. Cooper.
No sign of Andy.

690
00:57:04,622 --> 00:57:06,624
Well, we're goin' for
the field goal, anyway.

691
00:57:06,657 --> 00:57:09,627
O'brien?
Get ready to go in there
and hold for Gus.

692
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:13,330
Stretcher bearers,
get ready to go
in there for o'brien.

693
00:58:00,545 --> 00:58:02,346
Then there's no
Debbie kovacs registered?

694
00:58:02,379 --> 00:58:04,549
No, sir. I'm sorry.
There isn't.

695
00:58:17,261 --> 00:58:19,730
Okay, get it!

696
00:58:19,764 --> 00:58:22,232
I've heard of a one-man dog,
but how could I wind up
with a one-man mule?

697
00:58:22,266 --> 00:58:25,169
Well, there's still
a chance, Mr. Cooper.
There's a whole quarter left.

698
00:58:25,202 --> 00:58:29,707
Ah, Debbie, we could have two
weeks left, but without Andy
holding for Gus, we're dead.

699
00:58:35,746 --> 00:58:40,618
Dr. Carlisle. Dr. Carlisle.
Call 2411.

700
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:52,597
Shhh.

701
00:59:57,828 --> 01:00:02,599
Oh, my. Well, folks,
any dreams the atoms had
of going to the super bowl...

702
01:00:02,633 --> 01:00:05,803
Have vanished
along with their little
placekick holder, Andy.

703
01:00:05,836 --> 01:00:10,307
Eighteen seconds to go.
Atoms' ball on their own 48.

704
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:12,342
Usually an automatic
field goal for Gus,

705
01:00:12,376 --> 01:00:16,313
but he refuses to kick
for anybody but Andy.

706
01:00:19,049 --> 01:00:21,318
Gus is out there,
Mr. Cooper.

707
01:00:21,351 --> 01:00:24,254
The question is,
who are we gonna send
out there with him?

708
01:00:28,826 --> 01:00:31,528
*

709
01:00:44,308 --> 01:00:46,176
All right, block that kick!

710
01:00:46,210 --> 01:00:49,346
Block that kick! Block
that kick! Block that kick!

711
01:00:49,379 --> 01:00:52,649
Oich! Please, Gus,for Andy!

712
01:01:05,162 --> 01:01:09,566
*

713
01:01:22,913 --> 01:01:25,315
Andy!

714
01:01:25,349 --> 01:01:27,051
My papa was right.

715
01:01:27,084 --> 01:01:31,088
I'm some hero when-- when
anybody can take my place.

716
01:01:40,865 --> 01:01:45,069
Well, if this were
my old aunt Hattie,

717
01:01:45,102 --> 01:01:48,105
I'd call it the vapors.

718
01:01:48,138 --> 01:01:52,743
I have a feeling if Andy
walked through that door,
the vapors would disappear.

719
01:01:52,777 --> 01:01:54,444
Gus is probably more
worried than any of us.

720
01:01:54,478 --> 01:01:57,581
Not any more worried
than I am.

721
01:01:57,614 --> 01:02:00,584
Where does a yugoslavian kid
go to drown his sorrows?

722
01:02:02,386 --> 01:02:04,822
I think I know.

723
01:02:06,824 --> 01:02:10,795
Twa flight 615 now departing.

724
01:02:12,797 --> 01:02:16,801
Hey, Andy! Congratulations.
I was at the game today.
That was a great win.

725
01:02:16,834 --> 01:02:19,103
Yeah, you're puttin' us
right on top, Andy.

726
01:02:19,136 --> 01:02:20,237
All right, Andy.
Right up there, huh?

727
01:02:20,270 --> 01:02:22,472
Andy, where's Gus?

728
01:02:22,506 --> 01:02:25,442
Never mind.
Can I have your autograph?
I mean, for my kid.

729
01:02:25,475 --> 01:02:28,946
What kid? It's for you.
And get one for me, too, harv.

730
01:02:28,979 --> 01:02:31,949
Andy, are you going
back to New York?
No, b-back to yugoslavia.

731
01:02:31,982 --> 01:02:34,718
But what about the play-offs
and the super bowl?

732
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:36,921
Gus will do very well
without me.

733
01:02:36,954 --> 01:02:40,090
No, he won't.

734
01:02:40,124 --> 01:02:42,326
Nor will an awful lot
of other people.

735
01:02:46,864 --> 01:02:51,635
Debbie, I'm sorry.
I didn't plan for it
to happen this way.

736
01:02:51,668 --> 01:02:53,804
It just happened.
I have to go.

737
01:02:53,838 --> 01:02:57,574
Okay. You have to go,
but can't we just talk
for a minute?

738
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:59,877
All right,
for just a minute.

739
01:03:07,384 --> 01:03:11,788
Andy--
Debbie, before you start, I know
now that my papa was right.

740
01:03:11,822 --> 01:03:15,926
Your papa? Your papa?
My papa was right
all along, Debbie.

741
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:20,865
I was never really a player.
If it weren't for Gus, i--

742
01:03:20,898 --> 01:03:22,266
Andy, listen to me.

743
01:03:22,299 --> 01:03:24,368
It isn't your papa.
It's you.

744
01:03:24,401 --> 01:03:26,670
You've gotta be something
in your own eyes...

745
01:03:26,703 --> 01:03:28,705
Before you can be anything
to anybody else.

746
01:03:28,738 --> 01:03:32,943
Sure. In the meantime,
my brother stjepan's the hero.

747
01:03:32,977 --> 01:03:36,881
Hero? Who cares
if you're a hero or not...

748
01:03:36,914 --> 01:03:39,316
If you're not man enough
to stay here and fight...

749
01:03:39,349 --> 01:03:41,886
For something or somebody
you care about?

750
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:48,025
Okay, go.

751
01:03:48,058 --> 01:03:50,194
Go ahead. Run away.

752
01:03:50,227 --> 01:03:54,698
You're just going to prove
to everybody that that zero
on your uniform is right.

753
01:04:04,909 --> 01:04:09,313
To yugoslavia?
You told him off?
Couldn't you just stop him?

754
01:04:09,346 --> 01:04:12,216
She did, Mr. Cooper.
Hi, kid.

755
01:04:12,249 --> 01:04:15,252
That mule is nothin'
without him, Debbie.
Nothin'!

756
01:04:15,285 --> 01:04:17,421
Once he's
on that plane--

757
01:04:20,424 --> 01:04:22,559
where you been, huh?
Well, i--

758
01:04:22,592 --> 01:04:25,062
never mind where you been.
I'll tell you where you're
gonna be from now on!

759
01:04:25,095 --> 01:04:29,566
Anywhere you say, Mr. Cooper.
I just want to say that
I'm sorry for all the trouble.

760
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:32,769
Uh-huh.
I want to apologize to you
and-and to Debbie--

761
01:04:32,802 --> 01:04:34,538
okay, okay, okay.

762
01:04:34,571 --> 01:04:37,274
You just win the play-offs
and the super bowl,
and all is forgiven.

763
01:04:37,307 --> 01:04:40,244
Right now, you and Gus
are going into hidin'.
It's all arranged.

764
01:04:40,277 --> 01:04:43,680
Yes, sir. Whatever you say.
But right now,
I've gotta see Debbie.

765
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:46,183
Naw, naw, naw, naw, naw.
Nothing doing.

766
01:04:46,216 --> 01:04:48,919
Nobody's goin' near you
till after the super bowl.

767
01:04:48,953 --> 01:04:51,388
N-not even Debbie?

768
01:04:51,421 --> 01:04:53,390
Not even nobody.

769
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:05,635
Yeah, well, Miami was tough.
It was real tough,

770
01:05:05,669 --> 01:05:08,638
but I, I had a gut feeling
that we'd take 'em if we just,

771
01:05:08,672 --> 01:05:12,109
you know, ran right into their
strength and, and passed
right into that zone...

772
01:05:12,142 --> 01:05:14,044
And swept right
around those ends.

773
01:05:14,078 --> 01:05:17,114
Uh, how about
the 14 field goals by Gus?

774
01:05:17,147 --> 01:05:19,149
Oh, yeah, well,
they helped too.

775
01:05:19,183 --> 01:05:21,718
Well, thank you,
coach venner.

776
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:24,321
And good luck
in the Superbowl,
all you atoms.

777
01:05:27,958 --> 01:05:30,794
Good game. Way to go.
Nice game.

778
01:05:30,827 --> 01:05:32,729
Really good.
That's the way to do it,
isn't it? Huh?

779
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:35,299
Good game, fellas.
Keep it up, guys.
Keep it up.

780
01:05:35,332 --> 01:05:37,834
Hey, Hank, you're
lookin' like a winner.
Gentlemen--

781
01:05:37,867 --> 01:05:40,104
congratulations.
Lookin' like a winner.

782
01:05:40,137 --> 01:05:42,639
Well, we'll know in two weeks,
won't we, Charlie?
Oh, come on.

783
01:05:42,672 --> 01:05:46,243
With Gus and Andy in there,
heh, the mammoths
don't stand a chance.

784
01:05:46,276 --> 01:05:49,746
By the way, where is Andy?
I'd like to congratulate
him too.

785
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:53,850
Oh, I'm sure you would,
but you'd need a fast car.

786
01:05:53,883 --> 01:05:56,920
Car?
Or plane.

787
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:59,156
Maybe even a boat.

788
01:05:59,189 --> 01:06:03,593
Hank, I just want
to congratulate him.

789
01:06:03,627 --> 01:06:08,832
I'll tell you what.
I'll arrange a special
interview with him...

790
01:06:08,865 --> 01:06:10,967
Right after we win
the super bowl.

791
01:06:19,909 --> 01:06:22,012
Andy, are you all right?

792
01:06:22,046 --> 01:06:24,681
No. It is my heart.

793
01:06:24,714 --> 01:06:27,951
Your heart?
Yes. It is
very lonely.

794
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:33,523
Mine too. Andy...
I really miss you.

795
01:06:33,557 --> 01:06:38,995
Me too.
You would love it here.

796
01:06:39,029 --> 01:06:43,333
When you climb
to the top of the mountain,
you can see the ocean.

797
01:06:43,367 --> 01:06:46,370
Oh, it sounds beautiful.

798
01:06:46,403 --> 01:06:48,705
Uh-huh.

799
01:06:48,738 --> 01:06:52,876
Can see the ocean?
Can see the--

800
01:06:52,909 --> 01:06:55,479
wait a minute. Sure!

801
01:06:55,512 --> 01:06:58,715
Hank Cooper's got a cabin
in the Malibu mountains in L.A.

802
01:06:58,748 --> 01:07:03,187
Now, Cal, if I was
a betting man--

803
01:07:30,147 --> 01:07:32,116
What's going on here?

804
01:07:34,118 --> 01:07:38,288
Oh, I am just so sorry
that my boys aren't here
to help me.

805
01:07:38,322 --> 01:07:40,624
You see, I was trying
to turn the bus around,
and look what happened.

806
01:07:40,657 --> 01:07:42,592
Could you lend me
a hand, please?

807
01:07:42,626 --> 01:07:45,462
Well, I don't know.
I think--
Gus can help. He's strong.

808
01:07:45,495 --> 01:07:48,098
Not on your life.
Anything happens to him,
it'll be my life.

809
01:07:48,132 --> 01:07:52,936
Back on our farm
when wagon is stuck,
we use a lever.

810
01:07:52,969 --> 01:07:55,139
I'll show you.

811
01:07:55,172 --> 01:07:58,108
Well, we might as well.
We can't get by you anyway.

812
01:08:04,481 --> 01:08:09,253
Excuse me, Gus.
We'll be on our way
in just a minute.

813
01:08:15,459 --> 01:08:17,727
Okay.

814
01:08:21,131 --> 01:08:24,968
No, you're not lookin'
at a mirror, Gus. That's just
the world's greatest paint job.

815
01:08:25,001 --> 01:08:29,639
Now, we're gonna play
a little musical mule,
so come on, out you go.

816
01:08:29,673 --> 01:08:34,144
It's just the two of us,
and we'd like twin
double beds, please.

817
01:08:34,178 --> 01:08:37,581
Yes, sir.
Room 319.

818
01:08:37,614 --> 01:08:41,117
Thank you.
Oopsy-Daisy!

819
01:08:41,151 --> 01:08:44,020
- Well, what's the matter?
- It's my contact lenses.

820
01:08:44,053 --> 01:08:47,824
They're always dropping out, and
they bounce all over the place.

821
01:08:47,857 --> 01:08:51,761
Well, let me help.
I've got 20/20 vision.

822
01:08:51,795 --> 01:08:53,863
Very kind of you.

823
01:08:55,031 --> 01:08:57,434
Now, you have
to be careful.

824
01:08:57,467 --> 01:09:00,036
Yeah.
Try over there.

825
01:09:14,651 --> 01:09:16,786
Found it.
Huh?

826
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:18,955
Where?
I don't see it.

827
01:09:18,988 --> 01:09:23,227
Oh, you oughta
have your eyes checked.
You need these worse than I do.

828
01:09:26,863 --> 01:09:29,032
You've been very helpful.

829
01:09:33,102 --> 01:09:35,071
Press three.

830
01:10:04,468 --> 01:10:06,903
You know,
this is crazy, spinner.

831
01:10:06,936 --> 01:10:09,406
We shouldn't have brought,
uh, you-know-who here.

832
01:10:09,439 --> 01:10:11,775
We should have gone
right to Mexico.

833
01:10:11,808 --> 01:10:15,912
With the most famous mule
in the country? Now, suppose
the cops would've caught us?

834
01:10:15,945 --> 01:10:18,515
Yeah, maybe you're right.

835
01:10:18,548 --> 01:10:22,252
Hey, I wonder if that
Cooper and company found out
they got the wrong mule yet.

836
01:10:22,286 --> 01:10:26,089
Well, how would I know?
The whole thing went off
without a hitch.

837
01:10:26,122 --> 01:10:29,225
Now, will you
get some sleep?

838
01:10:29,259 --> 01:10:33,129
Tomorrow, right after the game,
we gotta get outta here.

839
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:46,276
Is that you, spinner?

840
01:10:46,310 --> 01:10:48,812
What?

841
01:10:48,845 --> 01:10:51,415
Somebody just crawled
in bed with me.

842
01:10:55,585 --> 01:10:59,456
Well, I guess
he had to sleep somewhere.
Yeah, but why with me?

843
01:10:59,489 --> 01:11:03,126
Well, how should I know?
Maybe you remind him
of his mother.

844
01:11:03,159 --> 01:11:04,828
Now go to sleep.

845
01:11:09,198 --> 01:11:11,234
Hmm.

846
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:13,102
Hey!

847
01:11:27,717 --> 01:11:31,321
Night.

848
01:11:36,893 --> 01:11:37,994
How'd he sleep last night?

849
01:11:38,027 --> 01:11:40,330
Never better, Mr. Cooper.

850
01:11:40,364 --> 01:11:45,301
But you know something?
He looks like he's put on
a few pounds, almost overnight.

851
01:11:45,335 --> 01:11:48,271
Well, as far as I'm concerned,
he can look like a whale...

852
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:51,274
As long as he doesn't go
out there and kick like one.

853
01:12:00,884 --> 01:12:03,186
Wanna order
of two glasses
of orange juice,

854
01:12:03,219 --> 01:12:06,723
two orders of toast--
one whole wheat, one rye--

855
01:12:06,756 --> 01:12:09,693
an order of scrambled
eggs and bacon,

856
01:12:09,726 --> 01:12:12,462
an order of, uh,
eggs over with sausage.

857
01:12:12,496 --> 01:12:15,331
Oh, uh,
you got any oatmeal?

858
01:12:15,365 --> 01:12:18,201
Well, send up a bucket.

859
01:12:18,234 --> 01:12:20,904
Raw.

860
01:12:20,937 --> 01:12:24,140
Same to you.

861
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:26,543
Yes, sir.
Here we are, folks.
The old pepper pot,

862
01:12:26,576 --> 01:12:28,978
pepper Allan and
his favorite sidekick,
Johnny unitas.

863
01:12:29,012 --> 01:12:32,716
We're here
in the city of the angels
on a rainy super bowl sunday.

864
01:12:32,749 --> 01:12:34,551
Game after game,
week after week,

865
01:12:34,584 --> 01:12:37,521
the struggle,
the anguish, the heartbreak
of the whole season...

866
01:12:37,554 --> 01:12:39,523
Has unfolded
before your eyes.

867
01:12:39,556 --> 01:12:42,592
And I've brought you
some great ones, haven't I?
You bet I have.

868
01:12:42,626 --> 01:12:46,062
I've given you
the highlights, the insights
and even the hindsights,

869
01:12:46,095 --> 01:12:50,333
but the story of the year
has got to be this amazing
California atoms team...

870
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:52,669
And their miracle
mule, Gus.

871
01:12:52,702 --> 01:12:56,406
They've gone from
the bottom of the pile
to winners by a mile.

872
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:59,409
And now what
are they gonna do to those
Michigan mammoths, Johnny?

873
01:12:59,443 --> 01:13:01,545
I'll tell you what
they're gonna do.

874
01:13:01,578 --> 01:13:03,112
As sure as there's
clouds in the sky
and rain in your eye,

875
01:13:03,146 --> 01:13:06,750
it's money in the bank
for the atoms.

876
01:13:06,783 --> 01:13:09,352
They may be short-changed
today, pepper.
The sun's coming out.

877
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:13,122
Well, sun or no sun, folks,
a muddy field means
turnover time,

878
01:13:13,156 --> 01:13:15,525
and let me tell you
what turnover means
to those atoms.

879
01:13:15,559 --> 01:13:17,761
They've lived by
the turnover all year long,

880
01:13:17,794 --> 01:13:21,965
and the question is,
will they live or die
by the turnover today?

881
01:13:21,998 --> 01:13:23,433
While you're working
on the answer, pepper,

882
01:13:23,467 --> 01:13:25,368
we've got some guests
from overseas in the booth,

883
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:27,370
and we'd better introduce them
before their visas run out.

884
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:30,574
You bet we have, Johnny.
Flown in all the way
from yugoslavia--

885
01:13:30,607 --> 01:13:35,111
at no small expense
to our network--
mama and papa Petrovic.

886
01:13:35,144 --> 01:13:38,615
It must be a thrill for you
to be here this afternoon
to see your son Andy perform.

887
01:13:38,648 --> 01:13:41,284
Andy good boy.
Good farmer.

888
01:13:41,317 --> 01:13:44,220
Goats and pigs
not the same since he left.

889
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:46,456
Mr. Petrovic,
there may be panic
in the pig pen,

890
01:13:46,490 --> 01:13:48,825
but we're talkin' about
a great American hero.

891
01:13:48,858 --> 01:13:51,127
Oh, the finger, yeah.

892
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:53,630
Papa, maybe Andy is a hero.

893
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:58,401
A man who holds the ball
for a mule to kick?
We'll see.

894
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:01,070
We'll all see.
Yes, indeed, folks,
'cause here they come.

895
01:14:01,104 --> 01:14:04,808
Both teams out
on the rain-soaked field,
and the dream game...

896
01:14:04,841 --> 01:14:08,512
That 100 million fanatic fans
have been waiting for
is about to happen...

897
01:14:08,545 --> 01:14:11,314
And old pepper
is gonna bring it to ya
right into your living room.

898
01:14:11,347 --> 01:14:14,317
And here's
a little scoop for you
right from the pepper pot.

899
01:14:14,350 --> 01:14:16,986
Rob cargil,
the ex-atom meat grinder,

900
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:18,988
is suited up and sitting
on the Michigan bench,

901
01:14:19,022 --> 01:14:21,190
splints and all,
ready if needed.

902
01:14:21,224 --> 01:14:26,195
Let me tell ya, folks,
right now he's the meanest
machine you've ever seen.

903
01:14:31,868 --> 01:14:34,504
Well, here comes the kickoff.

904
01:14:34,538 --> 01:14:38,474
Are you ready, Gus?

905
01:14:38,508 --> 01:14:40,644
Oich!

906
01:14:44,914 --> 01:14:48,317
What happened?
Huh?

907
01:14:49,919 --> 01:14:52,856
Gus, what's the matter?

908
01:14:55,859 --> 01:14:59,729
Gus? Are you Gus?

909
01:14:59,763 --> 01:15:02,732
You're not Gus!

910
01:15:02,766 --> 01:15:06,536
Hey, that mule's gone ape.
What's the matter with him?

911
01:15:06,570 --> 01:15:08,404
Whatever it is, stay away
from his hind legs...

912
01:15:08,437 --> 01:15:11,040
Unless you wanna wind up
lookin' like that TV set.

913
01:15:17,547 --> 01:15:19,415
Hey!

914
01:15:23,419 --> 01:15:28,091
What's goin' on out there?
Where'd that white spot
come from?

915
01:15:28,124 --> 01:15:30,594
Something must've
rubbed off, Mr. Cooper.

916
01:15:30,627 --> 01:15:33,396
You know,
I got a sister-in-law
who had a nose job.

917
01:15:33,429 --> 01:15:36,833
Maybe we've got a--
a mule with a paint job.

918
01:15:36,866 --> 01:15:38,868
No, just kidding.

919
01:15:38,902 --> 01:15:41,437
That's not even Gus,
you nincompoop!

920
01:15:54,784 --> 01:15:56,720
Hey!

921
01:15:56,753 --> 01:16:00,223
It's a fraud!
The old shell game, folks.

922
01:16:00,256 --> 01:16:04,260
Hank Cooper and
the missing mule have made
jackasses of all of you.

923
01:16:04,293 --> 01:16:07,430
I tried to tell you.
Didn't I, Johnny?
You bet I did.

924
01:16:07,463 --> 01:16:09,432
The bubble
had to burst sometime,

925
01:16:09,465 --> 01:16:11,868
and the bubble burst
right in the first half.

926
01:16:11,901 --> 01:16:14,904
So far, this super bowl
has been a laugher
for the mammoths,

927
01:16:14,938 --> 01:16:17,641
but I don't seem
to hear any laughin',
do you, Johnny?

928
01:16:17,674 --> 01:16:20,610
No, I don't either.
Especially from the atoms.

929
01:16:20,644 --> 01:16:23,713
'Cause take it from us,
folks, there's no more Gus.

930
01:16:23,747 --> 01:16:26,616
Mr. Cooper,
they've spotted Gus.
Where is he?

931
01:16:26,650 --> 01:16:29,452
Somewhere near topanga canyon,
but they lost him.
Let's go, kid.

932
01:16:29,485 --> 01:16:31,487
But where?
How do I know?
We're gonna find him,

933
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,623
and if we don't,
nobody better find
the two of us.

934
01:16:42,832 --> 01:16:45,001
See anything,
Mr. Cooper?

935
01:16:45,034 --> 01:16:48,104
Same thing you do, kid.
Nothing.

936
01:16:48,137 --> 01:16:50,674
That half-time
must be almost over.

937
01:17:14,898 --> 01:17:18,134
Uh, excuse me.

938
01:17:51,534 --> 01:17:54,971
Listen, no mule
is gonna outsmart us.

939
01:17:55,004 --> 01:17:58,041
Yeah? Well, he's doing
a pretty good job so far.

940
01:17:58,074 --> 01:18:00,209
This place is as good
as any corral.

941
01:18:00,243 --> 01:18:02,678
Now, you round him up,
and I'll lasso him.
You think you can handle that?

942
01:18:02,712 --> 01:18:05,248
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I used to be a bus boy
on a dude ranch.

943
01:18:27,270 --> 01:18:29,205
I got him!

944
01:19:49,986 --> 01:19:53,857
Spinner! I got him!
I got him!

945
01:19:59,195 --> 01:20:00,964
Hi.

946
01:20:05,835 --> 01:20:08,704
Oh... oh.

947
01:20:18,047 --> 01:20:21,484
Hello.

948
01:20:21,517 --> 01:20:24,753
Am I in your way?

949
01:20:28,992 --> 01:20:31,694
Whooaahh!

950
01:21:34,557 --> 01:21:37,927
I got him.
Oh. I got him.

951
01:21:37,961 --> 01:21:40,529
Whoa. Whoa.

952
01:21:40,563 --> 01:21:42,331
Whoa there.
Whoa. Whoa.

953
01:21:44,300 --> 01:21:46,669
Steady now, Gus.
Hold it. Whoa.

954
01:21:56,112 --> 01:21:58,914
Let go of me!

955
01:21:58,948 --> 01:22:02,952
Ohhh!

956
01:22:09,292 --> 01:22:10,559
Who was that?

957
01:22:10,593 --> 01:22:12,895
Oh, yes.
We package it
all ourselves.

958
01:22:12,928 --> 01:22:16,299
That's how we built
our reputation for having
the freshest meat in town.

959
01:22:16,332 --> 01:22:19,302
Hey! Hey!

960
01:22:19,335 --> 01:22:20,836
Freshest meat!

961
01:22:23,672 --> 01:22:25,774
All right, all right,
all right.

962
01:22:25,808 --> 01:22:28,444
Look, crankcase,
you go have a look
over there, huh?

963
01:22:28,477 --> 01:22:29,945
Yeah.
Hey.

964
01:22:29,979 --> 01:22:32,515
Huh?
And try and be
a little more discreet.

965
01:22:49,032 --> 01:22:51,000
Get him! Get him!

966
01:22:54,003 --> 01:22:55,071
Ohhh.

967
01:22:58,641 --> 01:23:01,877
Ohhh! Help!
Aaah! Whoa!

968
01:23:03,579 --> 01:23:06,649
- Ohhh.
- Hey, mom, look at that!

969
01:23:19,562 --> 01:23:21,197
What are you doing
in there, huh?

970
01:23:31,707 --> 01:23:34,743
Hey, don't--
don't do that!

971
01:24:10,613 --> 01:24:13,916
All right,
quit foolin' around.
Huh?

972
01:24:13,949 --> 01:24:16,119
Stay close.

973
01:24:22,158 --> 01:24:24,793
Which--

974
01:24:28,564 --> 01:24:31,100
which way did he go?

975
01:24:31,134 --> 01:24:35,271
I don't know, but
I'll tell you one thing. I'd
settle for goin' back to jail.

976
01:24:35,304 --> 01:24:39,142
Not with 25 g's at stake.

977
01:24:39,175 --> 01:24:42,778
Now, you go over there.
I'm goin' up here
for a better look.

978
01:24:43,812 --> 01:24:46,449
Oh, wait a minute.
Here.

979
01:24:46,482 --> 01:24:50,486
Get me a bottle of aspirin.
I got an awful headache.

980
01:25:25,554 --> 01:25:28,524
Aaaaah! No!

981
01:25:56,252 --> 01:25:59,688
Whoa.

982
01:25:59,722 --> 01:26:02,057
Whoa, Gus. Whoa.
Whoa. Whoa. Wh--

983
01:26:02,090 --> 01:26:05,127
whoa. Whoa!

984
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:08,631
Oh.

985
01:26:08,664 --> 01:26:11,367
Spinner, I got him!

986
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:13,236
Tsk. Really!

987
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:23,145
Oh, my goodness!
I'm a mess!

988
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:34,557
Give him room!
Get out of the way!

989
01:26:34,590 --> 01:26:37,125
Give him some room!
Somebody stop him! No!

990
01:26:40,796 --> 01:26:44,600
Sorry, Mr. Cooper.
There's no sign of him at all.

991
01:26:44,633 --> 01:26:47,703
And it's one hour
till doomsday.

992
01:26:47,736 --> 01:26:49,872
Not yet!
Look down there!
It's Gus!

993
01:26:54,943 --> 01:26:58,080
Another
of pepper's predictions
was right again, folks.

994
01:26:58,113 --> 01:27:01,049
Safe and sound,
Gus has been found!

995
01:27:01,083 --> 01:27:04,553
And the mule-nappers
are on their way
to the rock pile.

996
01:27:04,587 --> 01:27:07,055
Ah, but before you start
cheerin' for the atoms,

997
01:27:07,089 --> 01:27:11,527
remember it's a long way
from topanga canyon
to the coliseum.

998
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:15,698
And there is no way--
no way they can get him
here on time.

999
01:27:15,731 --> 01:27:17,700
Uh, pepper,
there's one way.

1000
01:27:17,733 --> 01:27:20,769
Johnny, there is no way.

1001
01:27:22,771 --> 01:27:26,809
Unless-- unless they
bring him in by helicopter,

1002
01:27:26,842 --> 01:27:29,244
and if they listen
to the old pepper pot,

1003
01:27:29,278 --> 01:27:31,747
that's exactly
what they'll do.

1004
01:28:28,537 --> 01:28:30,138
Oich!

1005
01:28:45,688 --> 01:28:46,822
Oich!

1006
01:29:07,676 --> 01:29:11,179
Unbelievable!
Inconceivable!

1007
01:29:11,213 --> 01:29:12,981
What a comeback, folks!

1008
01:29:13,015 --> 01:29:15,518
Five consecutive
field goals!

1009
01:29:15,551 --> 01:29:18,987
The atoms have been
stickin' and the mule
has been kickin'.

1010
01:29:19,021 --> 01:29:22,057
And with two minutes
to play, don't go away!

1011
01:29:22,090 --> 01:29:24,527
The old pepper pot...

1012
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:27,396
Wouldn't miss bringin' this
to you for a-- for--

1013
01:29:27,430 --> 01:29:30,399
well, at last,
it's nice to come into
your livin' room, everybody.

1014
01:29:30,433 --> 01:29:32,668
If you think you've seen
a miracle on the field,

1015
01:29:32,701 --> 01:29:35,003
we've been treated
to an even bigger one
here in the booth.

1016
01:29:35,037 --> 01:29:37,906
The old pepper head's
ground to a halt.

1017
01:29:37,940 --> 01:29:39,942
But I think I know
what he'd like to say.

1018
01:29:39,975 --> 01:29:42,044
Week after week,
game after game,

1019
01:29:42,077 --> 01:29:44,379
play after play,
have I ever been wrong?

1020
01:29:44,413 --> 01:29:48,417
And now, with all my insight,
hindsight and foresight,
let me tell you, mother,

1021
01:29:48,451 --> 01:29:51,420
this is the greatest
comeback in the history
of American sports.

1022
01:29:51,454 --> 01:29:54,056
Win or lose, the atoms
have made it a game.

1023
01:29:54,089 --> 01:29:56,459
And I told you all along,
and I'm telling you again,

1024
01:29:56,492 --> 01:29:59,027
the mule is the team
and the team's on the beam.

1025
01:29:59,061 --> 01:30:02,097
Yes, sirree.
And how have the atoms
been doing it, folks?

1026
01:30:02,130 --> 01:30:04,867
No muss, no fuss,
just Gus.

1027
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:07,770
Right, pepper?
Right.

1028
01:30:07,803 --> 01:30:10,939
There! Five three!

1029
01:30:10,973 --> 01:30:14,577
One, twenty-nine,
and... hut!

1030
01:30:22,751 --> 01:30:26,388
Well, it looks as if
you've won yourself
a ball team, Charlie.

1031
01:30:26,421 --> 01:30:31,126
And the first thing you're
gonna do is to get that mule's
hoofprint on a contract.

1032
01:30:31,159 --> 01:30:33,796
Better work on our
goal line defense.
Prescott.

1033
01:30:33,829 --> 01:30:37,399
With ten seconds left,
what's the difference if they
win by one or a hundred?

1034
01:30:37,432 --> 01:30:42,471
Well, losing by one point
isn't bad at all, Mr. Cooper.
It's something to be proud of.

1035
01:30:42,505 --> 01:30:47,876
Don't you understand?
I've lost the team.

1036
01:30:49,377 --> 01:30:52,014
Well, it's something
for the next owner
to be proud of.

1037
01:30:54,483 --> 01:30:58,020
Andy, you and Gus
have come so close,
I'm sure your papa realizes.

1038
01:30:58,053 --> 01:31:02,491
He must be proud of you.
It isn't papa
I'm worried about.

1039
01:31:02,525 --> 01:31:06,361
To him I'll always be
a half a hero.
It's Mr. Cooper.

1040
01:31:06,394 --> 01:31:10,499
I'm sorry we couldn't
win it for him.

1041
01:31:14,336 --> 01:31:17,039
Well, here they go,
Mr. Cooper.

1042
01:31:17,072 --> 01:31:19,842
Oh, good idea.
I can't watch either.

1043
01:31:19,875 --> 01:31:22,177
I'm praying.

1044
01:31:22,210 --> 01:31:26,048
Oh. Well, if you're
praying for rain, we've had
plenty of that already.

1045
01:31:26,081 --> 01:31:28,183
I'm praying for a--

1046
01:31:29,752 --> 01:31:31,019
fumble!

1047
01:31:37,660 --> 01:31:41,229
*

1048
01:31:43,766 --> 01:31:47,469
it's a fumble!
Andy, you and Gus get out there
and do your stuff!

1049
01:31:47,502 --> 01:31:49,705
But we have to kick
from the end zone,
Mr. Cooper,

1050
01:31:49,738 --> 01:31:52,575
and Gus isn't too accurate
over a hundred yards.

1051
01:31:52,608 --> 01:31:55,043
Kid, kid, just relax.

1052
01:31:55,077 --> 01:31:57,880
Be calm.
Don't think about a thing.

1053
01:31:57,913 --> 01:32:02,084
Forget that an old man's life
or death depends upon this kick,
and get out there!

1054
01:32:03,518 --> 01:32:06,254
Go, Andy!
Go, Gus!

1055
01:32:09,892 --> 01:32:11,894
Holy Toledo!
Look who's comin' in!

1056
01:32:20,068 --> 01:32:23,572
While you're down there,
say a little prayer, runt,
'cause when the ball's snapped,

1057
01:32:23,606 --> 01:32:25,974
I'm turning that spot into
a yugoslavian burial ground.

1058
01:32:30,913 --> 01:32:35,083
We've gone this far, Gus.
Now we're going all the way.

1059
01:32:42,925 --> 01:32:45,160
Oich! Gus!

1060
01:32:58,506 --> 01:33:01,276
Go, Andy!

1061
01:34:00,302 --> 01:34:01,737
He fumbled.
Oh, no!

1062
01:34:11,379 --> 01:34:13,148
Get it!

1063
01:34:19,922 --> 01:34:22,825
He's got it!

1064
01:34:22,858 --> 01:34:24,159
Go, Andy!

1065
01:34:54,089 --> 01:34:57,092
*

1066
01:35:15,443 --> 01:35:18,747
Yea!

1067
01:35:46,641 --> 01:35:50,645
This is my boy!
Is real hero, huh?

1068
01:36:20,508 --> 01:36:24,346
Well, Gus, your other half
stole the thunder,

1069
01:36:24,379 --> 01:36:26,314
but don't let it
get you down.

1070
01:36:26,348 --> 01:36:29,217
Even the best of them
slip once in a while.

1071
01:36:33,355 --> 01:36:37,960
Slip, Gus?
Come on.
