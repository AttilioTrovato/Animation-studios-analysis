2
00:02:06,908 --> 00:02:09,382
Nazeem Khan, you made a statement in a
party in London that you're not married..

3
00:02:09,406 --> 00:02:10,274
But you do have kids.

4
00:02:10,354 --> 00:02:11,585
That means you're in a live-in.

5
00:02:11,609 --> 00:02:14,814
You've disgraced the institution
of marriage and Indian Culture!

6
00:02:14,894 --> 00:02:16,396
What are you guys saying?

7
00:02:16,476 --> 00:02:18,480
I am a proud Indian.
And I always will be.

8
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,936
I celebrate all the festivals like Eid,
Diwali, etcetera.

9
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,806
Then after doing movies like "Marry
me" and "The Union of Two Families"..

10
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,854
How can you say such
things about marriage?

11
00:02:25,297 --> 00:02:27,010
Says who? Who said I abused it.

12
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,661
You want controversy, don't you?
You'll never get it.

13
00:02:28,685 --> 00:02:29,435
Go home.

14
00:02:29,515 --> 00:02:31,536
Your next film Marry me Monalisa
just a publicity stunt. Go home.

15
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,349
And even your late night
parties are always in the news.

16
00:02:35,019 --> 00:02:36,439
It's my life.

17
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:37,814
I can do what I want.

18
00:02:37,894 --> 00:02:39,828
Whether I party till late
at night or have a live-in..

19
00:02:39,852 --> 00:02:41,490
How does it matter to you?

20
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:42,968
You don't pay my bills.

21
00:02:43,048 --> 00:02:43,852
Live-in, huh..

22
00:02:43,935 --> 00:02:46,394
So you're being termed
as anti-national and it's true.

23
00:02:46,477 --> 00:02:48,560
Tell us. Please tell us.

24
00:02:48,644 --> 00:02:49,937
He's gone.

25
00:02:51,831 --> 00:02:53,973
- 'Nazeem Khan.'
- 'Down-Down.'

26
00:02:54,053 --> 00:02:55,852
- 'Nazeem Khan.'
- 'Down-Down.'

27
00:02:55,935 --> 00:02:58,468
- 'Glory to..'
- 'Culture Protection Party.'

28
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:03,360
'There are quite a few similarities
between a politician and actor.'

29
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,522
'They are both drama queens..'

30
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,980
'..and they both want publicity,

31
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,692
And lots of it.'

32
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,826
'No one knows what Nazeem Khan said in..'

33
00:03:11,906 --> 00:03:17,132
'..but it certainly deemed
love as a sin in UP and MP.'

34
00:03:17,752 --> 00:03:23,074
'Suddenly live-in relationships
had become a national issue.'

35
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,685
'Nazeem Khan's films posters were torn..'

36
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,633
'..along with lovers whose
clothes were stripped off.'

37
00:03:30,111 --> 00:03:33,114
'Because according to the Culture
Protection Party that states..'

38
00:03:33,194 --> 00:03:36,216
'..that men and women being
seen together before marriage..'

39
00:03:36,296 --> 00:03:38,650
'..is against Indian Culture.'

40
00:03:39,045 --> 00:03:41,168
'They have their own set of rules.'

41
00:03:41,248 --> 00:03:43,327
'And in case you don't
like their rules..'

42
00:03:43,407 --> 00:03:44,897
'..you are free to raise your voice.

43
00:03:44,977 --> 00:03:46,344
Feel free to raise your voice.'

44
00:03:46,747 --> 00:03:50,190
'But it won't change anything,
except for getting a sore throat maybe.'

45
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:54,079
'With cameraman Abbas Shaikh,
I am Guddu Shukla, Mathura, live.'

46
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,789
- 'Nazeem Khan.'
- 'Down-Down.'

47
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:57,027
Beat him!

48
00:04:00,576 --> 00:04:02,708
'The protest over Nazeem
Khan's statement..'

49
00:04:02,788 --> 00:04:06,412
'..has taken a violent turn
in many parts of the country.'

50
00:04:06,492 --> 00:04:09,090
'As you can see how the workers
of the Culture Protection Party..'

51
00:04:09,114 --> 00:04:11,284
'..are apprehending young lovers..'

52
00:04:11,367 --> 00:04:13,111
'..and coloring their face black.'

53
00:04:13,191 --> 00:04:16,284
'As result colleges were closed
down in many parts of the city.'

54
00:04:16,367 --> 00:04:18,575
'But the biggest question
that still lingers is..'

55
00:04:18,655 --> 00:04:20,845
'..whether this is really
a cultural question..'

56
00:04:20,925 --> 00:04:23,512
'..or just a PR stunt
for the upcoming elections.'

57
00:04:23,592 --> 00:04:24,714
'We'll find out after the break..'

58
00:04:24,738 --> 00:04:28,433
'..from Culture Protection party's ex-MP,
Mathura, Vishnu Trvedi..'

59
00:04:30,056 --> 00:04:32,992
Guddu, I spoke with the
people with Diamond news in Delhi.

60
00:04:33,572 --> 00:04:36,783
They want us to do another
job before the Gwalior Elections.

61
00:04:38,034 --> 00:04:39,992
They want us to prepare a report..

62
00:04:40,076 --> 00:04:45,501
With opinions from different people
on marriage and live-in relationship.

63
00:04:46,127 --> 00:04:49,403
Which they will telecast
as an interesting feature.

64
00:04:49,483 --> 00:04:51,540
We're ready, sir.
Just tell us when.

65
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,927
- Hello, Mr. Trivedi.
- Come, uncle.

66
00:04:52,951 --> 00:04:53,951
Come sit.

67
00:04:53,992 --> 00:04:54,742
Come Rashmi.

68
00:04:54,826 --> 00:04:56,162
- Mr. Pandey.
- Hello, sir.

69
00:04:56,242 --> 00:04:57,576
- How are you?
- All well.

70
00:04:57,659 --> 00:04:59,066
It's okay. It's okay.

71
00:04:59,438 --> 00:05:01,242
Come, sit. Get some tea.

72
00:05:01,326 --> 00:05:03,117
What can I order for you, Mr. Trivedi?

73
00:05:03,197 --> 00:05:05,653
There's no need for such formality.

74
00:05:05,733 --> 00:05:09,617
Tell me..how's your channel doing?

75
00:05:09,697 --> 00:05:12,034
Well, thanks to your grace.

76
00:05:12,117 --> 00:05:14,371
How's your political party doing?

77
00:05:14,451 --> 00:05:15,992
Culture Protection Party.

78
00:05:16,589 --> 00:05:20,662
Well, it's doing better than ever.

79
00:05:20,967 --> 00:05:23,296
And I owe it to these traitors..

80
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:26,468
Who can't show some respect for
our country, our culture, and religion.

81
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:29,441
We're rallying against this Nazeem Khan.

82
00:05:29,521 --> 00:05:32,502
We won't let any of
his films released in UP.

83
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,260
And if we spot his picture
at some barbershop..

84
00:05:34,284 --> 00:05:35,385
Then we'll burn it down to ashes.

85
00:05:35,409 --> 00:05:37,992
The picture, the shop,
and even the cars outside the shop.

86
00:05:38,076 --> 00:05:39,715
- Long live revolution..
- Okay, okay.

87
00:05:41,284 --> 00:05:43,901
Mr. Pandey, she's my daughter Rashmi.

88
00:05:43,981 --> 00:05:44,981
Hello.

89
00:05:45,034 --> 00:05:46,957
Remember I told you about
her over the phone. Yes, yes.

90
00:05:46,981 --> 00:05:49,218
She just returned a week ago from Delhi..

91
00:05:49,298 --> 00:05:51,204
After getting a
degree in Media studies.

92
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:52,990
She even did her schooling out there.

93
00:05:53,427 --> 00:05:54,912
My younger brother lives there.

94
00:05:54,992 --> 00:05:57,800
Uncle runs a transport
business in Gurgaon.

95
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,537
He owns 72 trucks. How many?

96
00:05:59,617 --> 00:06:00,617
Seventy-two..

97
00:06:00,701 --> 00:06:04,022
And none of his trucks
ever stop at toll..

98
00:06:07,725 --> 00:06:10,214
Rashmi was saying that
she wants to go back to Delhi..

99
00:06:10,755 --> 00:06:12,645
To work as an
assistant on a TV channel.

100
00:06:12,725 --> 00:06:14,659
That's internship, father.

101
00:06:14,922 --> 00:06:15,962
Exactly.

102
00:06:16,383 --> 00:06:19,576
But I said our very own
Pandey owns a channel right here.

103
00:06:19,761 --> 00:06:22,046
It's right here in Mathura,
so why not give it a try.

104
00:06:22,126 --> 00:06:24,451
This way you can live
with me for a couple more days.

105
00:06:24,534 --> 00:06:26,549
Mr. Trivedi, this is your company.

106
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:27,629
See..

107
00:06:27,859 --> 00:06:28,951
- Rashmi.
- Yes.

108
00:06:29,031 --> 00:06:31,051
I must tell you one thing
before you begin working.

109
00:06:31,415 --> 00:06:32,867
We're not some big news channel.

110
00:06:33,146 --> 00:06:34,993
We run a cable-news channel.

111
00:06:35,073 --> 00:06:38,443
And also do some freelance
work for the New channels in Delhi.

112
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,101
Not a problem.

113
00:06:40,271 --> 00:06:42,117
And anyway, it's only for a month.

114
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:44,037
I am not planning on staying here forever.

115
00:06:44,117 --> 00:06:47,094
So this way I'll get to
know the local news network..

116
00:06:47,174 --> 00:06:49,367
And I can put this on my CV as well.
So..

117
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:51,454
Fine. You can join from tomorrow.

118
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:53,701
We were just discussing a report.

119
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:55,492
You can join in if you want.

120
00:06:55,572 --> 00:06:57,505
- Yes, of course.
- Great.

121
00:06:58,117 --> 00:06:59,617
Let me introduce you to our team.

122
00:06:59,697 --> 00:07:02,567
This is Guddu Shukla, our star reporter.

123
00:07:02,647 --> 00:07:04,576
Only a fool wouldn't know him.

124
00:07:04,656 --> 00:07:07,661
He's the face of your channel.

125
00:07:07,741 --> 00:07:09,076
A one-take artist.

126
00:07:09,372 --> 00:07:11,328
I've seen you reporting on TV.

127
00:07:11,408 --> 00:07:13,326
Your style's quite different.

128
00:07:13,992 --> 00:07:15,081
Thank you.

129
00:07:16,242 --> 00:07:17,522
Elections are around the corner.

130
00:07:17,576 --> 00:07:19,690
And I am running for the
Parliament Elections again.

131
00:07:20,098 --> 00:07:22,252
I'll give you a couple
of interviews as well.

132
00:07:23,662 --> 00:07:24,662
Uncle..

133
00:07:24,923 --> 00:07:26,386
Him too.

134
00:07:27,634 --> 00:07:30,291
- And that's our cameraman.
- Yes.

135
00:07:30,371 --> 00:07:31,482
Abbas.

136
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:36,139
Radhe-Radhe!

137
00:07:36,626 --> 00:07:37,857
'Walekum Salaam.'

138
00:07:46,371 --> 00:07:47,871
Radhe-Radhe!

139
00:07:47,951 --> 00:07:50,534
So we're with Babaji
from KC Ghat (RIVERBANK),

140
00:07:50,614 --> 00:07:54,085
So Babaji, this new issue on
the block about live-in relationships..

141
00:07:54,293 --> 00:07:58,580
Where the men and women live
together without getting married..

142
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,303
What is your opinion about it.

143
00:08:00,795 --> 00:08:05,649
Look, son, since the time I was born..

144
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:09,068
I've only venerated Radha-Krishna.

145
00:08:09,506 --> 00:08:16,613
And in the end, I can tell
you that even they were not married.

146
00:08:17,051 --> 00:08:21,356
And there is no bigger love
story in this world than theirs.

147
00:08:21,436 --> 00:08:25,595
So you mean Babaji that live-in
relationships are not wrong.

148
00:08:25,675 --> 00:08:28,176
As long as their love,
everything's chaste, dear.

149
00:08:29,117 --> 00:08:34,971
Without love, it's wrong to
look at anyone with such intentions.

150
00:08:36,751 --> 00:08:40,196
<i>♪ All the books in the world won't
show you the path to enlightenment. ♪</i>

151
00:08:40,466 --> 00:08:44,359
<i>♪ But those who experience love,
get enlightened. ♪</i>

152
00:08:45,472 --> 00:08:47,237
I have a question, Guddu.

153
00:08:48,162 --> 00:08:50,867
If Shahjahan had a live-in
relationship with Mumtaz..

154
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,755
Would he still has built the Taj Mahal?

155
00:08:56,557 --> 00:08:59,285
Taj Mahal is not the symbol
of Shahjahan's wedding..

156
00:09:00,176 --> 00:09:01,654
It's the symbol of his love.

157
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:03,784
Don't you have anything better to do?

158
00:09:03,864 --> 00:09:05,941
Always bothering me about
something or the other.

159
00:09:06,251 --> 00:09:07,548
Where the hell did you guys come from?

160
00:09:07,572 --> 00:09:08,454
You..

161
00:09:08,534 --> 00:09:09,659
Live-in is a good thing.

162
00:09:09,739 --> 00:09:11,659
I was in a live-in for 8 years in Delhi.

163
00:09:11,739 --> 00:09:13,843
But there are other issues
in the country that you can cover.

164
00:09:13,867 --> 00:09:15,427
Many other types of news.
So cover those.

165
00:09:15,451 --> 00:09:17,617
This is a stupid issue.

166
00:09:17,701 --> 00:09:19,093
- You're in a live-in.
- What's wrong?

167
00:09:19,117 --> 00:09:21,076
- You're in a live-in.
- Leave my hand.

168
00:09:21,156 --> 00:09:23,367
But is live-in our culture?

169
00:09:23,451 --> 00:09:25,951
Live-in is just an excuse for sex.

170
00:09:26,034 --> 00:09:29,187
Just find me a girl,
and I'll take care of the rest.

171
00:09:29,591 --> 00:09:30,869
Right?

172
00:09:37,922 --> 00:09:40,559
Living with a female without marriage?

173
00:09:40,954 --> 00:09:44,351
I never even saw my wife's
picture before our wedding.

174
00:09:44,431 --> 00:09:46,614
I quietly did what father said.

175
00:09:46,694 --> 00:09:48,538
And now I am the father of three.

176
00:09:48,618 --> 00:09:52,996
I wasn't exactly floored
on your handsome face either.

177
00:09:53,076 --> 00:09:56,701
All thanks to your government
job and your father.

178
00:09:56,781 --> 00:09:58,786
Otherwise,
you would've still been a bachelor.

179
00:09:58,866 --> 00:10:00,829
God save us from such a wife.

180
00:10:02,008 --> 00:10:03,917
Aunty is very danger.

181
00:10:09,153 --> 00:10:11,948
Hello, grandma.
We're from TV news.

182
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,534
Why are you yelling?

183
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:16,367
I am old, not deaf.

184
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,704
We wanted to ask you questions.

185
00:10:23,784 --> 00:10:26,047
Go ahead and ask whatever you want to.

186
00:10:27,451 --> 00:10:29,454
- Would you like to ask her instead?
- What?

187
00:10:29,534 --> 00:10:30,553
Would you?

188
00:10:31,951 --> 00:10:33,226
- Okay.
- I see..

189
00:10:33,306 --> 00:10:34,532
She is going to ask her.

190
00:10:36,148 --> 00:10:37,148
All the best.

191
00:10:37,197 --> 00:10:38,197
Thank you.

192
00:10:38,412 --> 00:10:40,698
Am I looking fine?

193
00:10:42,182 --> 00:10:44,789
Wait a second.
This profile is better.

194
00:10:45,901 --> 00:10:47,173
She's looking better from this side?

195
00:10:47,197 --> 00:10:48,302
Grandma?

196
00:10:51,455 --> 00:10:52,912
- Ready, Rashmi?
- Yes.

197
00:10:52,992 --> 00:10:53,624
Camera rolling.

198
00:10:53,704 --> 00:10:57,033
Grandma, a new system has taken
the country by storm these days..

199
00:10:57,401 --> 00:11:01,191
Where the men and women
live together before the marriage..

200
00:11:01,386 --> 00:11:03,152
In order to know each other.

201
00:11:03,232 --> 00:11:04,334
In the same house.

202
00:11:04,711 --> 00:11:06,492
So what is your opinion about it?

203
00:11:08,917 --> 00:11:10,732
That's a really nice system, dear.

204
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:16,733
If before my marriage I knew
that my husband was a drunkard..

205
00:11:16,813 --> 00:11:19,112
Then I would've never married him.

206
00:11:19,727 --> 00:11:21,492
Stupid died at such an early age.

207
00:11:21,822 --> 00:11:24,062
Left me with no children and no respect.

208
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,076
Thank you.

209
00:11:25,156 --> 00:11:26,156
Listen.

210
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:28,909
Take my advice.

211
00:11:29,406 --> 00:11:31,641
Don't ever marry a guy until
you don't properly know him?

212
00:11:31,665 --> 00:11:32,802
- Rashmi, let's go.
- No, no, I won't.

213
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:33,883
Yes, she won't.

214
00:11:33,963 --> 00:11:35,023
- Leave her.
- Yes, grandma.

215
00:11:35,047 --> 00:11:35,804
- Don't you forget that?
- Sure.

216
00:11:35,884 --> 00:11:37,461
- Rashmi, let's go.
- I won't.

217
00:11:37,813 --> 00:11:38,868
Very good, grandma.

218
00:11:39,108 --> 00:11:40,218
Everyone says Grandma rocks.

219
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:41,246
Grandma Rocks!

220
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:42,326
Grandma bye!

221
00:11:42,486 --> 00:11:43,784
By the way, Guddu..

222
00:11:44,076 --> 00:11:46,596
What is your opinion about
live-in relationships and marriage?

223
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,620
Me?

224
00:11:48,284 --> 00:11:51,888
Even I feel as long as there's love,
everything is pure.

225
00:11:52,367 --> 00:11:54,927
But if there's true love,
then why the hesitation to get married?

226
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,636
If tying the knot gives your relationship
the respect it deserves in the society..

227
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,315
Then isn't it better to get married.

228
00:12:01,037 --> 00:12:02,826
- Are you married?
- No.

229
00:12:03,183 --> 00:12:04,784
Any girlfriend?

230
00:12:05,117 --> 00:12:06,117
None.

231
00:12:06,655 --> 00:12:07,843
Okay.

232
00:12:08,934 --> 00:12:10,872
- Why?
- Just a casual question?

233
00:12:14,117 --> 00:12:15,596
Do you have a BF?

234
00:12:15,676 --> 00:12:16,676
BF?

235
00:12:17,174 --> 00:12:18,174
Not anymore.

236
00:12:19,088 --> 00:12:20,088
So you did have one?

237
00:12:21,863 --> 00:12:22,992
Just a casual question.

238
00:12:24,505 --> 00:12:26,417
I did, back in college.

239
00:12:26,976 --> 00:12:27,784
And then?

240
00:12:27,867 --> 00:12:29,355
Then what?
I shot back to reality.

241
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:30,958
Meaning?

242
00:12:31,038 --> 00:12:33,451
Meaning people act so stupid when in love.

243
00:12:34,117 --> 00:12:35,996
They don't see what they should.

244
00:12:36,076 --> 00:12:38,700
Sometimes they get impressed
by someone cool branded clothes..

245
00:12:38,998 --> 00:12:41,347
And sometimes by the perfume they wear.

246
00:12:42,075 --> 00:12:45,296
And you face reality
when the perfume fades.

247
00:12:46,572 --> 00:12:47,659
So you're single.

248
00:12:47,739 --> 00:12:48,739
What?

249
00:12:48,932 --> 00:12:51,784
I mean..I don't need perfume at all.

250
00:12:51,864 --> 00:12:55,742
I smell good naturally.

251
00:12:55,826 --> 00:12:56,826
Really?

252
00:12:59,349 --> 00:13:01,040
You have bad taste.

253
00:13:03,778 --> 00:13:04,917
Bye.

254
00:13:04,997 --> 00:13:06,193

That's all.

298
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,007
What's the matter?
You're going pretty fast today, Shukla.

299
00:15:31,031 --> 00:15:32,718
I've been noticing your
life's pace has increased.

300
00:15:32,742 --> 00:15:34,258
What pace?

301
00:15:34,338 --> 00:15:37,010
You're out of your mind. I am only
driving fast because the road's empty.

302
00:15:37,034 --> 00:15:37,954
I see..

303
00:15:38,034 --> 00:15:41,578
And what about that smile
you've been wearing all day?

304
00:15:41,658 --> 00:15:44,412
Did you prop up your
lips with a hanger all night?

305
00:15:44,492 --> 00:15:46,833
It's all because of love, my friend.

306
00:15:46,913 --> 00:15:50,541
While looking for new stories,
you've started your love story.

307
00:15:50,621 --> 00:15:53,185
Tell me one thing,
what if her father finds out?

308
00:15:53,265 --> 00:15:56,066
When in love, there's no place for fear.

309
00:15:56,146 --> 00:16:01,247
Love is never planned.
It just happens.

310
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,367
Pretty amazing.

311
00:16:03,561 --> 00:16:05,076
I will pray to God..

312
00:16:05,156 --> 00:16:08,854
That your love story becomes
immortal like Radha-Krishna.

313
00:16:10,741 --> 00:16:11,617
What happened?

314
00:16:11,701 --> 00:16:14,076
You do know that Radha-Krishna
were not married.

315
00:16:14,156 --> 00:16:17,110
These things were okay
during Radha-Krishna's time.

316
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:19,343
But times are different now.
This is Vishnu sir's time.

317
00:16:19,367 --> 00:16:21,326
And son, Krishna was a God..

318
00:16:21,409 --> 00:16:25,409
And you're an ordinary man
who couldn't even clear college.

319
00:16:25,492 --> 00:16:28,201
Uncle, we caught him in the bathroom
with a female.

320
00:16:28,281 --> 00:16:29,117
Disgusting.

321
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:33,243
People go there to receive their stomach,
And you were relieving your heart.

322
00:16:33,647 --> 00:16:35,108
What do we do with him now?

323
00:16:36,472 --> 00:16:37,617
What else?

324
00:16:38,116 --> 00:16:39,829
Give him a proper bath.

325
00:16:40,347 --> 00:16:42,997
I'll color your face black and
take you around the city on a donkey.

326
00:16:43,021 --> 00:16:44,616
Elections are around the corner.

327
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:46,659
Coloring his face black will do no good.

328
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:48,446
Then let's shave his head.

329
00:16:49,566 --> 00:16:51,886
Why are you hellbent on performin Mr.
Yadav's final rites..

330
00:16:51,951 --> 00:16:52,965
While he's still alive?

331
00:16:52,989 --> 00:16:54,236
Then what else do we do?

332
00:16:56,676 --> 00:16:58,534
How many children does Mr. Yadav have?

333
00:16:58,718 --> 00:17:00,659
He's got four other sons,
not counting this one.

334
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,326
Good.

335
00:17:04,366 --> 00:17:06,046
Even if one of his
sons becomes a cripple..

336
00:17:06,311 --> 00:17:08,246
The other four can
carry the lineage forward.

337
00:17:08,326 --> 00:17:10,549
Great. Let's go.

338
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,734
"Killed me."

339
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:22,257
Bollywood, Hip-Hop, Salsa, Alsa, Moonwalk,
Son walk, Kanjivaram, Kuchipudi..

340
00:17:22,501 --> 00:17:25,992
Festival dance, wedding dance, political
dance, we teach all of the above.

341
00:17:26,072 --> 00:17:27,659
What do you want to learn?

342
00:17:27,742 --> 00:17:28,742
Dance?

343
00:17:29,451 --> 00:17:31,145
I came here to see the plot.

344
00:17:31,402 --> 00:17:33,221
Plot? We have that too.

345
00:17:33,474 --> 00:17:36,867
1BHK, 2BHK, Bungalow plot, Tower.

346
00:17:36,947 --> 00:17:39,951
And mister, nothing can beat
a bungalow at any time.

347
00:17:40,031 --> 00:17:43,409
Judging by his face, I think
we'll have to show him the cheap ones.

348
00:17:43,492 --> 00:17:47,652
We'll give you a good
deal on an expensive..

349
00:17:56,353 --> 00:18:01,756
I'll give this man a good
deal on an expensive plot.

350
00:18:01,836 --> 00:18:05,087
Show him the pictures,
and I'll be right back.

351
00:18:06,659 --> 00:18:08,034
Give me the new one.

352
00:18:08,117 --> 00:18:09,175
What's your salary?

353
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:11,867
This is a new print in chiffon.

354
00:18:11,951 --> 00:18:13,371
It will look stunning on you.

355
00:18:13,451 --> 00:18:14,915
This is another color.

356
00:18:15,468 --> 00:18:17,242
- This?
- Even green will look nice on you.

357
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:19,742
How much for this one?

358
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,949
This one and this one for 350 rupees.

359
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:24,387
350 rupees?

360
00:18:24,467 --> 00:18:25,658
- This one?
- Yes.

361
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:27,576
But its available on
the market for only 100.

362
00:18:27,659 --> 00:18:30,848
What are you saying, madam?
That's too less.

363
00:18:31,207 --> 00:18:33,115
Why don't you quote your price?

364
00:18:33,867 --> 00:18:34,867
55!

365
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:37,916
55?

366
00:18:38,105 --> 00:18:39,473
Yes, 55 is good.

367
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,826
Take it for free.

368
00:18:42,218 --> 00:18:44,748
That hanky outside cost 55 rupees.

369
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:47,367
There's a limit to haggling.

370
00:18:47,887 --> 00:18:51,086
Fine. Final price, 65.

371
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:53,151
It's not your cup of tea, ma'am.

372
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:54,659
- Why?
- Leave it.

373
00:18:54,739 --> 00:18:58,792
You can pay 100..only for you.

374
00:18:58,872 --> 00:19:00,516
- Pack it up.
- Have you lost your mind?

375
00:19:00,596 --> 00:19:03,851
Never.. I won't give you this
sari for anything less than 300.

376
00:19:03,931 --> 00:19:04,951
Strange.

377
00:19:05,318 --> 00:19:07,045
You two are quoting such different price.

378
00:19:07,704 --> 00:19:08,912
Done deal.

379
00:19:08,992 --> 00:19:11,496
- I'll pay a 100.
- Never.

380
00:19:11,576 --> 00:19:13,228
- 300..
- Wait, Vikas.

381
00:19:13,982 --> 00:19:16,173
Jasmine?

382
00:19:18,117 --> 00:19:19,467
Chandni.

383
00:19:21,809 --> 00:19:23,099
Jasmine.

384
00:19:24,118 --> 00:19:25,621
Myself Babulal.

385
00:19:25,701 --> 00:19:27,537
But people call me Chand.

386
00:19:27,617 --> 00:19:30,510
Who on earth talks to you,
or calls you Chand.

387
00:19:31,325 --> 00:19:34,372
Madam, nothing less than 300 rupees.

388
00:19:34,452 --> 00:19:35,534
Take it or leave it.

389
00:19:35,617 --> 00:19:38,076
The deal's done in 100 rupees.
Here are your 100 rupees.

390
00:19:38,156 --> 00:19:40,542
- But how..
- Please, no arguments.

391
00:19:40,795 --> 00:19:43,162
We can't sell you this
sari for anything less than 300.

392
00:19:43,242 --> 00:19:44,481
Father..

393
00:19:44,636 --> 00:19:47,451
She'll pay 100 and
I'll pay the remaining 200.

394
00:19:47,534 --> 00:19:48,731
Pay up.

395
00:19:49,618 --> 00:19:50,662
First, pay.

396
00:19:50,742 --> 00:19:51,599
Pay up.

397
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,885
Please leave,
we don't want to sell this sari.

398
00:19:52,909 --> 00:19:53,949
Why not?

399
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:56,043
I said pay the 200 rupees.

400
00:19:58,023 --> 00:20:00,785
Stop winking at me.
You think you own this shop.

401
00:20:00,865 --> 00:20:02,364
Bloody rascal.

402
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:05,326
Who do you think you're abusing.

403
00:20:05,409 --> 00:20:06,860
Yes, this is your father's shop.

404
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:07,816
Then why don't you handle the business?

405
00:20:07,896 --> 00:20:10,162
Both your brother sit here
dressed as females all day..

406
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:12,349
Bloody ordinary reporter.

407
00:20:13,029 --> 00:20:16,204
You are going to tell
me what I am going to do.

408
00:20:16,284 --> 00:20:17,701
Bloody mutt..

409
00:20:17,784 --> 00:20:18,659
Control him.

410
00:20:18,739 --> 00:20:19,570
Stop him.

411
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:21,492
Don't call me that.
I have a reputation here.

412
00:20:21,572 --> 00:20:23,400
Because you built the roads around here,
didn't you?

413
00:20:23,424 --> 00:20:26,492
Guddu, why do you argue
with him every day? Let him go.

414
00:20:26,576 --> 00:20:27,728
He's my brother-in-law.

415
00:20:27,808 --> 00:20:30,409
Brother, he's a disgrace
to all brothers-in-law.

416
00:20:30,757 --> 00:20:32,367
He comes here to ogle at women.

417
00:20:32,447 --> 00:20:34,951
Guddu, let him go!

418
00:20:35,031 --> 00:20:35,867
And go home.

419
00:20:35,951 --> 00:20:37,580
Brother-in-law, I will do something.

420
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,551
What will you do?

421
00:20:40,659 --> 00:20:41,746
Guddu.

422
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,909
- Leave him.
- What are you doing?

423
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:45,034
I didn't say anything yet.

424
00:20:45,117 --> 00:20:46,968
I always let you go because
you were my brother-in-law's brother.

425
00:20:46,992 --> 00:20:48,451
But things have gone overboard now.

426
00:20:48,534 --> 00:20:49,733
And yet you're still here.

427
00:20:49,813 --> 00:20:51,327
I won't sink so easily.

428
00:20:51,407 --> 00:20:52,492
But you can burn.

429
00:20:52,572 --> 00:20:53,909
Run fast.

430
00:20:53,989 --> 00:20:55,504
Shall I burn you?

431
00:20:55,584 --> 00:20:57,058
- Brother-in-law!
- Leave me.

432
00:20:57,138 --> 00:20:58,576
Shall I burn you?

433
00:20:58,659 --> 00:21:00,990
Your sister-in-law will kill me.

434
00:21:02,503 --> 00:21:06,005
Mr. Dubey, you want to say..

435
00:21:06,085 --> 00:21:10,198
- That they didn't like Vikas, right?
- Yes.

436
00:21:10,278 --> 00:21:12,785
But they also said that
they have no objections..

437
00:21:12,865 --> 00:21:14,652
In letting their
daughter marry Guddu.

438
00:21:14,736 --> 00:21:16,057
What nonsense.

439
00:21:16,768 --> 00:21:18,614
When we're trying to
find a bride for Vikas..

440
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,087
Then how does Guddu
get involved in all this?

441
00:21:20,111 --> 00:21:22,556
Which picture did you send them?

442
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:24,423
Why didn't you dye your
hair before clicking your picture?

443
00:21:24,447 --> 00:21:26,111
I did, mother.

444
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:29,156
But I wrote my original date of birth.

445
00:21:29,236 --> 00:21:32,787
Mr. Shukla,
you won't find a family like this one.

446
00:21:32,867 --> 00:21:34,697
Why don't you ask Guddu once?

447
00:21:34,777 --> 00:21:36,143
He might even say yes.

448
00:21:36,223 --> 00:21:39,385
Go on.
Let someone gets married, father.

449
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:42,120
At least I'll get another
pair of hands to help me out.

450
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,114
I can't do all these chores alone now.

451
00:21:44,194 --> 00:21:47,281
I'm tired of washing their underwear.

452
00:21:47,361 --> 00:21:49,156
Brother-in-law, please say yes.

453
00:21:49,236 --> 00:21:50,420
I don't think he's getting
married anytime soon.

454
00:21:50,444 --> 00:21:51,194
What nonsense.

455
00:21:51,277 --> 00:21:52,831
And who wears underwear in this house?

456
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:54,440
- I see..
- That's enough.

457
00:21:55,883 --> 00:21:59,409
And you, Mr. Dubey. Why do
you bring such stupid proposals?

458
00:21:59,489 --> 00:22:01,494
Why don't you ever
bring a decent proposal?

459
00:22:01,574 --> 00:22:03,855
How many more proposals
do you expect me to get?

460
00:22:03,935 --> 00:22:06,320
Do you have any idea how many proposals I
sought for you over the last 8 years?

461
00:22:06,344 --> 00:22:08,587
Right. And the very first
proposal was from my daughter.

462
00:22:08,611 --> 00:22:09,989
Even she's had three children now.

463
00:22:10,069 --> 00:22:12,527
Who knows that these two
might remain bachelors forever..

464
00:22:12,607 --> 00:22:14,511
And Cheeku gets married first.

465
00:22:14,591 --> 00:22:16,690
Mom, even I want to get married.

466
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:17,833
Shut up, Cheeku.

467
00:22:18,058 --> 00:22:20,387
He want to get marriage.
Do you even know what marriage is?

468
00:22:20,467 --> 00:22:22,371
Even you're unmarried,
then how do you know?

469
00:22:22,451 --> 00:22:23,652
Cheeku. Quiet.

470
00:22:23,736 --> 00:22:25,025
Don't yell at the kid.

471
00:22:25,105 --> 00:22:26,951
He is talking about getting married.

472
00:22:27,031 --> 00:22:29,448
These days people are living
together without getting married.

473
00:22:29,472 --> 00:22:31,147
- Like that Nazeem Khan.
- Dubey!

474
00:22:31,227 --> 00:22:33,147
Don't you dare take that name in here?

475
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:35,538
You won't utter his name.

476
00:22:35,931 --> 00:22:38,577
These film-stars these days.

477
00:22:38,998 --> 00:22:41,162
This is what they are
promoting to this generation.

478
00:22:42,363 --> 00:22:45,064
I can't stop thinking
about his parent's ordeal.

479
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:47,920
It's better not to have children,
then to have someone like him.

480
00:22:47,944 --> 00:22:50,739
- Fine. Calm down. Calm down.
- Bravo. Bravo.

481
00:22:50,819 --> 00:22:54,125
Don't spoil your health
for that shameless man.

482
00:22:54,683 --> 00:22:57,238
Mr. Dubey,
you tell us what we do next?

483
00:22:57,318 --> 00:23:00,742
They are looking for someone
with a high-profile job.

484
00:23:00,822 --> 00:23:03,022
Mr. Dubey, no job's too big or small.

485
00:23:03,102 --> 00:23:04,297
Great.

486
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:07,072
Then why don't you
handle the saree shop?

487
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:09,304
Has the doctor advised
you to come on TV?

488
00:23:09,384 --> 00:23:10,818
Why are you interfering?

489
00:23:11,505 --> 00:23:13,528
Father, please tell him
to keep his mouth shut..

490
00:23:13,608 --> 00:23:15,486
Or else I will
kick him out some day..

491
00:23:15,569 --> 00:23:16,306
Just a minute.

492
00:23:16,386 --> 00:23:18,618
Dubey, there's no
room for debate on this.

493
00:23:19,265 --> 00:23:22,572
I said I don't approve of
this proposal, then that's final.

494
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:23,993
Go and tell him that.

495
00:23:24,759 --> 00:23:25,787
Fine.

496
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:30,786
But there's one thing
that's still unclear to me.

497
00:23:30,866 --> 00:23:33,324
Younger brother getting
married before the older one.

498
00:23:33,404 --> 00:23:34,165
How?

499
00:23:34,245 --> 00:23:36,016
Who's getting him married?

500
00:23:36,096 --> 00:23:38,569
Whoever gets married first,
but what is your problem?

501
00:23:38,649 --> 00:23:40,265
What do you mean by that?

502
00:23:40,345 --> 00:23:41,611
See father.

503
00:23:41,691 --> 00:23:43,918
I think his intentions are not good.

504
00:23:43,998 --> 00:23:45,755
Babulal is right about you.

505
00:23:45,835 --> 00:23:48,079
Who are you guys to
form an opinion about me?

506
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,342
And I'll get married whenever I want.

507
00:23:50,422 --> 00:23:52,125
I'll get married
before you if I want to.

508
00:23:52,205 --> 00:23:53,884
- You'll do it first!
- Who's older amongst us?

509
00:23:53,908 --> 00:23:55,000
- Vikas.Vikas.
- I am older.

510
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,645
So I will get married first.

511
00:23:56,725 --> 00:23:58,381
And if you get married before me..

512
00:23:58,461 --> 00:24:01,526
Then I'll beat you to a pulp.

513
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:02,975
Now you just watch.

514
00:24:03,055 --> 00:24:06,400
I was just contemplating this idea,
but now I've decided.

515
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,168
Brother.
Book a marriage hall right now.

516
00:24:08,248 --> 00:24:10,712
Now I will get married first.

517
00:24:10,792 --> 00:24:12,963
Vikas, remember what I had said.

518
00:24:13,043 --> 00:24:14,938
He will get married before you.

519
00:24:15,018 --> 00:24:18,547
And if this happens then
the society will look down on you.

520
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:20,083
Cheeku.

521
00:24:20,788 --> 00:24:22,320
- You rascal..
- Listen..

522
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,245
No one would want to
let their daughter marry you.

523
00:24:24,269 --> 00:24:27,700
- They will say that your system's rusted.
- Is your system well working, right?

524
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,798
Why don't you yell out
louder and let everyone know?

525
00:24:29,822 --> 00:24:31,517
Why is he making a racket?

526
00:24:31,597 --> 00:24:33,590
Father, you be quiet.

527
00:24:34,449 --> 00:24:35,994
'Take my advice Guddu
and get married.'

528
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:38,531
'Who knows that these two
might remain bachelors forever..'

529
00:24:38,611 --> 00:24:40,194
and Cheeku gets married first.'

530
00:25:22,293 --> 00:25:25,740
'Cheeku's uncle,
give him your blessings.'

531
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:02,277
A suit in this weather?

532
00:26:02,357 --> 00:26:03,517
Were you attending a wedding?

533
00:26:03,569 --> 00:26:05,473
Wedding..yes..I mean no.

534
00:26:06,069 --> 00:26:07,069
You're looking nice.

535
00:26:08,444 --> 00:26:09,881
So what was so important?

536
00:26:17,183 --> 00:26:19,083
Hello, brother.
What on earth are you doing?

537
00:26:19,163 --> 00:26:20,226
Brother?

538
00:26:22,158 --> 00:26:24,905
- I came to propose to you.
- Marriage?

539
00:26:24,985 --> 00:26:27,066
Are you out of your mind?
What is this charade?

540
00:26:27,146 --> 00:26:29,512
This is not a charade,
just my feelings.

541
00:26:30,206 --> 00:26:31,883
You do love me, don't you?

542
00:26:31,963 --> 00:26:34,989
Yes, Guddu. But love and
marriage are two different things.

543
00:26:35,069 --> 00:26:36,962
I am not ready to get married yet.

544
00:26:37,042 --> 00:26:41,433
I mean..I still have to go to Delhi,
get a job, become a journalist.

545
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:45,406
And I am not stopping you from doing
any of this.

546
00:26:45,486 --> 00:26:47,672
But you can do all
this even after marriage.

547
00:26:47,752 --> 00:26:50,212
And, we'll settle down
in Delhi post the wedding.

548
00:26:50,292 --> 00:26:51,694
Even career will begin in Delhi.

549
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:54,221
But I don't even
know you so well, Guddu.

550
00:26:54,301 --> 00:26:56,032
How can I marry you
on such short notice?

551
00:26:56,825 --> 00:26:59,248
I am not telling you
to get married right now.

552
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:01,454
But marry only me.

553
00:27:01,534 --> 00:27:05,024
Whether we do it not or later, but
we must get to know each other better.

554
00:27:05,431 --> 00:27:08,202
And we can never do that
if we keep meeting so secretly.

555
00:27:08,282 --> 00:27:09,616
What else do you want to know?

556
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,611
I am like an open book.

557
00:27:10,694 --> 00:27:13,665
And one needs time
to read an open book. So..

558
00:27:15,744 --> 00:27:17,822
Remember what that grandma said.

559
00:27:17,902 --> 00:27:19,325
If she knew that her
husband was a drunkard..

560
00:27:19,349 --> 00:27:21,842
Then she would've
never married her.

561
00:27:21,922 --> 00:27:23,638
But I don't drink at all,
and you know that.

562
00:27:23,662 --> 00:27:25,265
It's not about the drinking problem.

563
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:27,280
Then what is it?

564
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,308
Sit down. Sit.

565
00:27:33,851 --> 00:27:36,640
Look Guddu,
I've already made this mistake once.

566
00:27:37,224 --> 00:27:38,796
And, I don't want to do it again.

567
00:27:39,731 --> 00:27:43,637
So until we don't
spend some time alone..

568
00:27:46,037 --> 00:27:47,126
Let's do one thing.

569
00:27:47,527 --> 00:27:48,906
We should go for a live-in.

570
00:27:48,986 --> 00:27:50,712
- What?
- What?

571
00:27:51,111 --> 00:27:52,890
I'm saying that we should
go for a live-in first.

572
00:27:52,914 --> 00:27:54,572
How can you bring up that topic now?

573
00:27:54,652 --> 00:27:57,351
Technically it comes
before the wedding.

574
00:27:57,732 --> 00:27:59,077
We should give it a try too.

575
00:27:59,157 --> 00:28:00,534
Everyone is.

576
00:28:00,614 --> 00:28:02,243
Everyone in Delhi-Mumbai
lives like this.

577
00:28:02,323 --> 00:28:04,881
The population of Delhi-Mumbai
is over 20 million, Rashmi.

578
00:28:04,961 --> 00:28:06,453
How can they live this way?

579
00:28:06,533 --> 00:28:08,432
And we're in Mathura,
it's a small city.

580
00:28:08,512 --> 00:28:09,880
We can't even walk hand-in-hand..

581
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,499
How do you expect
us to go for a live-in?

582
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,976
That Nazeem Khan's created
quite a stir in the city.

583
00:28:14,056 --> 00:28:17,003
Even brothers and sisters can't step out
of their home because of your father.

584
00:28:17,027 --> 00:28:18,539
And you want to go
for a live-in with me.

585
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:21,467
Why are you such a wimp?
It's only a matter of a few days.

586
00:28:21,971 --> 00:28:23,787
Let's try staying
together for a few days.

587
00:28:24,336 --> 00:28:27,072
If everything goes well,
then I can give marriage a thought.

588
00:28:27,592 --> 00:28:28,672
Yeah!

589
00:28:29,302 --> 00:28:30,823
I don't get it.

590
00:28:30,903 --> 00:28:33,346
Being a girl,
I am not afraid of a live-in..

591
00:28:33,426 --> 00:28:34,969
Why are you being such a coward?

592
00:28:35,049 --> 00:28:36,726
Gender is not the problem, Rashmi.

593
00:28:36,953 --> 00:28:39,159
My face is shown every
day on Mathura's Cable TV.

594
00:28:39,239 --> 00:28:41,887
Even the dogs,
cats, cows, and buffaloes know me.

595
00:28:41,967 --> 00:28:44,179
And even your father
is pretty well acquainted.

596
00:28:44,259 --> 00:28:46,315
Even out here,
we're always on our toes..

597
00:28:46,395 --> 00:28:48,689
So that no one recognizes us.

598
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:51,906
I don't understand how
will we go for a live-in.

599
00:28:51,986 --> 00:28:53,536
And when?
What will we tell our family?

600
00:28:53,616 --> 00:28:55,108
And the most important question..

601
00:28:55,188 --> 00:28:56,763
Where are we going to stay?

602
00:28:59,986 --> 00:29:00,819
Gwalior.

603
00:29:00,902 --> 00:29:01,822
Gwalior.

604
00:29:01,902 --> 00:29:02,924
What, Gwalior?

605
00:29:03,221 --> 00:29:06,614
We are going to Gwalior
to cover the Municipal Elections.

606
00:29:06,694 --> 00:29:08,531
It's a 20-day job.

607
00:29:08,611 --> 00:29:10,753
And we'll request Mr.
Pandey to send Rashmi with us too.

608
00:29:10,777 --> 00:29:11,697
That's it.

609
00:29:11,777 --> 00:29:15,020
You mean to say we should
go to Gwalior for 20 days.

610
00:29:15,451 --> 00:29:18,237
Do our jobs, and also try
our hand at a live-in relationship?

611
00:29:18,317 --> 00:29:20,489
- Absolutely.
- That's great.

612
00:29:20,569 --> 00:29:23,813
What an idea, Abbas.
You're brilliant.

613
00:29:23,893 --> 00:29:27,874
That I am.
This is the best idea you can get.

614
00:29:27,954 --> 00:29:30,497
Away from your family.
Tell them it's an official trip.

615
00:29:30,577 --> 00:29:32,044
And even get what you want.

616
00:29:32,861 --> 00:29:34,881
Why? What are you thinking now?

617
00:29:35,569 --> 00:29:37,114
What is the problem now?

618
00:29:37,194 --> 00:29:39,989
It's far away from home.
And no one knows you out there.

619
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:43,038
So no one will know,
and we can even do what we intend to.

620
00:29:44,444 --> 00:29:45,462
Done.

621
00:29:46,647 --> 00:29:48,861
Done. Done.

622
00:29:54,894 --> 00:29:57,009
You two are cute together.

623
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:11,863
<i>♪ Father, what you have taught me. ♪</i>

624
00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:18,951

632
00:31:26,948 --> 00:31:28,944
Did you check the hotels?

633
00:31:29,027 --> 00:31:30,560
No, I'll do it now.

634
00:31:30,944 --> 00:31:32,077
Why hotel?

635
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:34,839
Then why go in for a live-in
if you're going to stay at a hotel?

636
00:31:35,097 --> 00:31:36,501
Is it written in the scriptures..

637
00:31:36,581 --> 00:31:38,545
That during a live-in,
we can't stay in a hotel?

638
00:31:38,569 --> 00:31:40,114
Unbelievable.

639
00:31:40,194 --> 00:31:44,027
Answer me this when does
a boy and a girl to stay at a hotel?

640
00:31:44,107 --> 00:31:46,152
- When?
- That's I am asking.

641
00:31:46,232 --> 00:31:48,247
When do a young girl
and a young boy..

642
00:31:48,327 --> 00:31:51,469
Stay at a hotel for 15-20 days?

643
00:31:51,549 --> 00:31:53,402
- Honeymoon.
- Honeymoon.

644
00:31:53,486 --> 00:31:55,625
That's the right answer.
And when does one go on a honeymoon?

645
00:31:55,649 --> 00:31:57,361
- After the wedding.
- After the wedding.

646
00:31:57,441 --> 00:31:58,712
And when does one go for a live-in?

647
00:31:58,736 --> 00:32:00,114
Before the wedding.

648
00:32:00,194 --> 00:32:02,656
Exactly.
Then why do you need a hotel?

649
00:32:02,736 --> 00:32:05,906
And anyway, living in a hotel
is not a live-in relationship.

650
00:32:05,986 --> 00:32:07,804
When a man and a woman living..

651
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:09,998
In the same house as husband
and wife without getting married..

652
00:32:10,022 --> 00:32:12,125
Then that's called
a live-in relationship. Simple.

653
00:32:12,205 --> 00:32:14,418
Are you an expert on this subject.

654
00:32:14,498 --> 00:32:16,449
How does it matter whether
we live in a hotel or house?

655
00:32:16,473 --> 00:32:18,777
It does matter.
Abbas is absolutely right.

656
00:32:18,857 --> 00:32:21,835
As long as we don't live in
the same house as husband and wife..

657
00:32:21,915 --> 00:32:24,098
- We'll never get to know each other.
- Yes.

658
00:32:24,178 --> 00:32:26,245
And everything is readily
available at the hotel.

659
00:32:26,325 --> 00:32:28,038
The staff cleans the room for you.

660
00:32:28,118 --> 00:32:29,668
Food's available in a phone call.

661
00:32:29,748 --> 00:32:31,235
And they even have laundry.

662
00:32:31,315 --> 00:32:32,755
Girls are intelligent.

663
00:32:33,025 --> 00:32:35,065
Other than that,
there's only one thing left to do..

664
00:32:35,111 --> 00:32:36,590
And for that, you need a bed.

665
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:38,182
If that's on your mind,
then you can book a hotel.

666
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:39,601
No, we're not going to do that.

667
00:32:40,266 --> 00:32:41,514
What do you mean?

668
00:32:41,819 --> 00:32:42,819
Means?

669
00:32:43,307 --> 00:32:46,265
I mean we'll do everything
that a husband and wife normally do.

670
00:32:46,345 --> 00:32:47,345
So..

671
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:51,407
Well, husband and
wife do that as well.

672
00:32:52,069 --> 00:32:54,336
Don't get too excited
and keep your eyes on the road.

673
00:32:54,416 --> 00:32:56,400
Think if an idea
to get home in Gwalior.

674
00:32:58,319 --> 00:32:59,783
I didn't hear anything.

675
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,606
<i>♪ O my beloved.. ♪</i>

676
00:33:06,513 --> 00:33:08,625
What was the name of the
hero who featured in that song?

677
00:33:08,649 --> 00:33:09,572
Nazeem Khan.

678
00:33:09,652 --> 00:33:12,035
Yeah..Nazeem Khan.

679
00:33:12,765 --> 00:33:14,691
Even you two are
in a similar situation.

680
00:33:15,307 --> 00:33:16,352
Great.

681
00:33:16,865 --> 00:33:18,739
But there's a problem.

682
00:33:18,819 --> 00:33:20,292
What problem?

683
00:33:22,859 --> 00:33:25,401
Have you heard about
the Culture Protection Party?

684
00:33:28,152 --> 00:33:29,856
What about them?

685
00:33:29,936 --> 00:33:33,031
They created quite a
stir after that new piece.

686
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:35,244
Those party workers
are a bunch of dogs.

687
00:33:35,324 --> 00:33:36,245
What are they?

688
00:33:36,325 --> 00:33:37,325
Dogs?

689
00:33:37,951 --> 00:33:39,877
You mean we can't get a room anywhere.

690
00:33:40,744 --> 00:33:42,365
At least not in Gwalior.

691
00:33:45,408 --> 00:33:46,856
Where are you going?

692
00:33:46,936 --> 00:33:51,239
I said it's difficult but possible.

693
00:33:51,319 --> 00:33:52,319
Sit.

694
00:33:52,388 --> 00:33:53,415
Meaning?

695
00:33:53,495 --> 00:33:58,822
Meaning, only I know
that you two are not married.

696
00:33:58,902 --> 00:34:01,490
And I am not going to tell anyone.

697
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:04,725
And if you don't tell anyone either..

698
00:34:04,805 --> 00:34:06,447
Then no one will know.

699
00:34:06,527 --> 00:34:07,919
Secret.

700
00:34:08,777 --> 00:34:10,197
What is marriage?

701
00:34:10,277 --> 00:34:13,069
Wear a necklace around your neck
and an anointment on your forehead.

702
00:34:13,152 --> 00:34:14,322
That's marriage.

703
00:34:14,402 --> 00:34:18,781
No one's going to ask for
your marriage certificate. Right?

704
00:34:18,861 --> 00:34:21,069
And even if someone does,
we'll arrange for that too.

705
00:34:21,149 --> 00:34:22,736
Everything's available out here.

706
00:34:22,816 --> 00:34:25,668
One can get a death certificate
for a man that's still alive.

707
00:34:25,748 --> 00:34:28,511
I got one for my
uncle when he fell sick.

708
00:34:28,591 --> 00:34:31,006
- Property matters are a real hassle.
- I don't mind.

709
00:34:31,421 --> 00:34:32,815
All it will take is an anointment
and a necklace around my neck.

710
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:34,114
- That's all.
- I am ready.

711
00:34:34,605 --> 00:34:36,377
- Yes.
- Yes.

712
00:34:36,457 --> 00:34:38,884
So what now? Shall we proceed?

713
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:40,838
Come on.

714
00:34:41,569 --> 00:34:42,903
Come, sir. Come.

715
00:34:44,077 --> 00:34:45,521
Here's your little love nest.

716
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:47,934
For an entire month.

717
00:34:48,183 --> 00:34:49,628
Its got everything you need.

718
00:34:49,916 --> 00:34:53,514
And the best part is
that the owner lives abroad..

719
00:34:53,868 --> 00:34:55,305
And comes only once a year.

720
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:57,459
He came down here last month
and come back before a year.

721
00:34:57,483 --> 00:34:58,729
But this one's Indian.

722
00:34:58,809 --> 00:35:02,990
Exactly, madam, Indian.
Everything in here is Indian.

723
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:05,536
East or West, India is the best. Tell me?

724
00:35:05,616 --> 00:35:07,388
How is the water facility?

725
00:35:07,468 --> 00:35:10,781
24/7, sister-in-law. In fact,
even the rainwater seeps directly in.

726
00:35:10,861 --> 00:35:13,080
We're not going to stay that long.

727
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:16,048
And what about the neighbors?
I hope they won't create problems.

728
00:35:16,128 --> 00:35:19,002
No problems at all. I am there.

729
00:35:21,167 --> 00:35:23,186
So we've to pay you
6,000 for this place?

730
00:35:24,402 --> 00:35:25,281
What?

731
00:35:25,361 --> 00:35:27,447
- 10,000
- But you just said 6000.

732
00:35:27,527 --> 00:35:30,906
That rate is for a married couple.

733
00:35:30,986 --> 00:35:32,906
And you're going to stay
here without a license..

734
00:35:32,944 --> 00:35:34,602
So it's going to cost you extra.

735
00:35:35,694 --> 00:35:36,870
What do you mean without a license?

736
00:35:36,894 --> 00:35:38,403
Meaning without getting married.

737
00:35:38,483 --> 00:35:40,697
Marriage is the license
to do anything you want.

738
00:35:41,655 --> 00:35:43,712
Since you're going to do
things without getting married..

739
00:35:43,736 --> 00:35:45,034
You'll have to pay the fine.

740
00:35:45,114 --> 00:35:47,128
Just like you do if you
drive a car without a license.

741
00:35:47,152 --> 00:35:49,364
Yes, we get it. Pay him.

742
00:35:50,277 --> 00:35:51,517
Here you go.

743
00:35:51,694 --> 00:35:55,778
For the sanctity of
your father and forefathers.

744
00:35:56,166 --> 00:35:57,782
- Keep it.
- Thank you.

745
00:35:57,986 --> 00:36:00,281
Now you won't face any problems.

746
00:36:00,361 --> 00:36:01,794
I guarantee you that.

747
00:36:02,525 --> 00:36:04,572
Hello. Hello. Hello.

748
00:36:04,652 --> 00:36:06,549
Myself Soni Shrivastav.

749
00:36:07,153 --> 00:36:08,979
I live in the house no. 12.

750
00:36:09,777 --> 00:36:11,697
Are you guys the new tenants?

751
00:36:11,777 --> 00:36:13,189
Yes.

752
00:36:13,269 --> 00:36:16,167
He's Mr. Guddu.
And that's his wife Rashmi.

753
00:36:16,247 --> 00:36:17,764
And he's Abbas.

754
00:36:18,156 --> 00:36:20,277
- Hello!
- Hello.

755
00:36:21,506 --> 00:36:23,069
Hello. Hello.

756
00:36:23,892 --> 00:36:27,076
So when are you guys moving in?

757
00:36:27,369 --> 00:36:28,837
- Well, we did move in just now.
- Okay.

758
00:36:28,861 --> 00:36:30,774
And it's a lucky day today.
Tuesday.

759
00:36:30,854 --> 00:36:34,021
Today is a very auspicious day.

760
00:36:34,101 --> 00:36:37,971
I watch Ramanand Baba's predictions
on television every day.

761
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:44,683
Actually..I see
all the programs on TV.

762
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:48,135
Why don't you install
cable TV in your home too?

763
00:36:48,215 --> 00:36:49,495
I'll give you their number.

764
00:36:49,575 --> 00:36:50,634
Yeah..

765
00:36:50,714 --> 00:36:54,770
In today's age,
you can do without a husband..

766
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:56,842
- But not without Cable TV.
- Yes.

767
00:36:58,732 --> 00:37:01,309
Well..then see you in the evening.
Right, Rashmi.

768
00:37:01,389 --> 00:37:03,679
Yeah, see you in the evening.

769
00:37:04,149 --> 00:37:05,858
- Thank you.
- Thank God!

770
00:37:05,938 --> 00:37:10,675
Just a minute.
I forgot to ask where you are from?

771
00:37:11,527 --> 00:37:12,973
- Allahabad.
- Kanpur. - Banaras.

772
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:22,527
She's from Allahabad.

773
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:24,406
He's from Banaras.

774
00:37:24,486 --> 00:37:25,864
And he's from Kanpur.

775
00:37:25,944 --> 00:37:29,069
And I am from Gwalior.
Right. Here's my card.

776
00:37:30,568 --> 00:37:31,694
Okay.

777
00:37:32,685 --> 00:37:33,787
Bye.

778
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:36,111
Bye, dear.

779
00:37:58,519 --> 00:38:01,127
Grapes, mango, strawberry..

780
00:38:12,663 --> 00:38:15,239
The shower doesn't work,
It's only there for decoration.

781
00:38:15,319 --> 00:38:17,031
I had to use the bucket instead.

782
00:38:17,111 --> 00:38:18,898
Back in Delhi,
every home had a shower.

783
00:38:19,302 --> 00:38:21,382
Are you going to say something?
I am speaking to you.

784
00:38:22,152 --> 00:38:23,902
I am listening.

785
00:38:24,319 --> 00:38:25,617
What did you hear?

786
00:38:27,166 --> 00:38:28,915
It's a nice home, isn't it?

787
00:38:30,027 --> 00:38:31,156
Very nice.

788
00:38:31,236 --> 00:38:32,612
Come on, now let's sleep.

789
00:38:33,777 --> 00:38:37,614
So soon. It's just 1 am.

790
00:38:37,694 --> 00:38:39,609
It's 1 AM. Now sleep.

791
00:38:56,819 --> 00:38:58,277
Are you asleep?

792
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:00,702
No. Why?

793
00:39:04,094 --> 00:39:06,707
I can't sleep.

794
00:39:07,861 --> 00:39:09,278
Wake up.

795
00:39:09,358 --> 00:39:11,423
And what do you expect
me to do, Guddu?

796
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:27,398
I read an article on live-in
relationships on Google.

797
00:39:30,986 --> 00:39:33,127
It was a really nice article.

798
00:39:34,068 --> 00:39:41,724
Explaining what to do,
how to do, and in which way.

799
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:46,738
Exactly like Abbas said.

800
00:39:47,284 --> 00:39:50,965
Live-in is about living
together like husband and wife.

801
00:39:52,055 --> 00:39:53,372
Understand?

802
00:39:56,652 --> 00:39:58,231
Are you asleep?

803
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:01,012
Guddu.

804
00:40:03,213 --> 00:40:05,358
I am really tired.

805
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:33,139
Actually, do we have protection?

806
00:40:34,108 --> 00:40:37,902
We do. Lots of it,
and in different varieties too.

807
00:40:47,499 --> 00:40:48,587
You're cute.

808
00:40:48,667 --> 00:40:51,423
- I had eaten lot of butter in childhood.
- Really.

809
00:40:51,723 --> 00:40:52,902
Guddu, careful.

810
00:40:52,982 --> 00:40:54,822
I am the only guy
from Shukla family..

811
00:40:54,902 --> 00:40:56,942
Who's getting this
experience before the wedding.

812
00:40:57,569 --> 00:40:59,085
How does one open this damn thing?

813
00:41:05,277 --> 00:41:07,889
- You know.. Google's..
- Yes.

814
00:41:09,127 --> 00:41:10,632
Really amazing.

815
00:41:13,925 --> 00:41:15,735
One should always follow it says.

816
00:41:20,202 --> 00:41:21,901
I want to do it again.

817
00:41:22,674 --> 00:41:23,866
Do it.

818
00:41:29,815 --> 00:41:31,930
I am not getting that.

819
00:41:39,132 --> 00:41:40,719
Who has come?

820
00:41:47,916 --> 00:41:49,927
Hello-Hello, son. Good morning.

821
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:51,007
Good morning, aunty.

822
00:41:51,037 --> 00:41:53,169
- Where is your wife?
- Which one?

823
00:41:53,523 --> 00:41:55,427
Which one?
How many wives do you have?

824
00:41:55,507 --> 00:41:56,958
I am talking about, Rashmi.

825
00:41:57,038 --> 00:41:58,595
- My wife, Rashmi?
- Yes.

826
00:41:58,675 --> 00:41:59,727
She's still asleep.

827
00:42:00,138 --> 00:42:01,174
Was it anything urgent?

828
00:42:01,591 --> 00:42:06,272
No, I just wanted to say if
you need anything feel free to ask.

829
00:42:06,352 --> 00:42:07,669
Yes, of course.

830
00:42:08,077 --> 00:42:09,800
- Bye, Bye son.
- Bye.

831
00:42:12,299 --> 00:42:14,072
What a peculiar woman.

832
00:42:14,358 --> 00:42:15,983
You mean the one who
can't live without cable TV.

833
00:42:16,007 --> 00:42:19,054
Yeah. She's always
snooping around our house.

834
00:42:31,841 --> 00:42:34,032
That's too much water,
It's completely dissolved.

835
00:42:34,466 --> 00:42:35,789
I can't eat this.

836
00:42:36,549 --> 00:42:37,775
You'll have to eat whatever we have.

837
00:42:37,799 --> 00:42:39,119
This is all we'll get in Gwalior.

838
00:42:39,172 --> 00:42:42,185
Mr. Gwalior, I'll handle the cooking,
no need to worry.

839
00:42:42,265 --> 00:42:44,854
You take care of the washing,
cleaning, dishes, etcetera.

840
00:42:44,934 --> 00:42:48,761
I do all the work,
and you only cook for two people.

841
00:42:48,841 --> 00:42:51,358
You know what, you handle the cooking,
cleaning, and dishes.

842
00:42:51,438 --> 00:42:52,606
And I'll do the rest.

843
00:42:53,669 --> 00:42:56,177
Okay. But you'll clean
the toilet and bathroom.

844
00:42:56,257 --> 00:42:57,907
You clean the toilet,
and I'll clean the bathroom.

845
00:42:57,931 --> 00:43:00,844
Come on, Guddu, that's the least
you can do. It doesn't take that long.

846
00:43:00,924 --> 00:43:03,486
And, I'll handle the cooking
only you got to do all the chopping.

847
00:43:03,566 --> 00:43:05,663
- That's not my cup of tea.
- I am not chopping anything, Rashmi.

848
00:43:05,687 --> 00:43:07,446
I am not asking, I am telling you.

849
00:43:07,734 --> 00:43:09,257
Now make me a nice cup of tea.

850
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:12,160
And I don't like ginger, so
don't forget to add lots of cardamoms.

851
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,769
Lots of cardamoms huh.

852
00:43:15,882 --> 00:43:17,132
I'll show you.

853
00:43:17,652 --> 00:43:18,776

864
00:44:07,365 --> 00:44:10,070
We're building 15
temples all over Gwalior.

865
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:12,457
Now you can ask God
for anything you want.

866
00:44:12,537 --> 00:44:16,580
Roads, electricity, water.
Anything you want.

867
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:20,969
You'll get everything you wish for.
But only when you have faith.

868
00:44:21,049 --> 00:44:24,677
What amazing ideology of
the Culture Protection Party.

869
00:44:24,757 --> 00:44:27,079
They are such uncomplicated people.

881
00:45:19,439 --> 00:45:22,467
Sister, you have this
knack of snooping around.

882
00:45:23,049 --> 00:45:24,382
I don't believe you.

883
00:45:24,466 --> 00:45:28,177
Sometimes she wears the bridal
necklace, sometimes she doesn't.

884
00:45:28,257 --> 00:45:30,857
Sometimes I see the anointment
on her forehead, sometimes I don't.

885
00:45:31,484 --> 00:45:34,848
I am sure she does,
but you must have missed it.

886
00:45:34,928 --> 00:45:36,560
I am telling you.

887
00:45:37,091 --> 00:45:40,153
I saw them with my own eyes
and heard everything with my own ears.

888
00:45:40,551 --> 00:45:42,439
They were dividing
the chores amongst them.

889
00:45:43,203 --> 00:45:45,969
They were running around
in the house like little children.

890
00:45:46,049 --> 00:45:47,753
In their underpants.

891
00:45:48,382 --> 00:45:50,302
We've been married for so many years.

892
00:45:50,382 --> 00:45:53,011
But my husband never chased
after me in his underpants.

893
00:45:53,091 --> 00:45:54,240
Right?

894
00:45:54,716 --> 00:45:57,240
My husband wears a loin-cloth.

895
00:45:57,672 --> 00:46:00,029
Doesn't he wear an
under pant under it?

896
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:02,338

Hello-Hello, dear. How are you?

913
00:47:19,882 --> 00:47:20,946
Hello, aunty.

914
00:47:21,026 --> 00:47:23,139
Sorry for troubling you at this hour.

915
00:47:23,219 --> 00:47:26,225
But you see, my husband's in the mood..
What?

916
00:47:27,008 --> 00:47:29,116
- For a cup of tea, dear.
- Okay.

917
00:47:29,196 --> 00:47:30,928
Can I borrow some milk?

918
00:47:31,008 --> 00:47:32,699
Yes, of course. Come in.

919
00:47:32,912 --> 00:47:33,930
- Come in.
- Okay.

920
00:47:39,134 --> 00:47:41,419
- Hello, aunty.
- Hello-Hello, son.

921
00:47:42,221 --> 00:47:43,221
Thank you.

922
00:47:56,852 --> 00:47:59,761
So son, how's work?

923
00:47:59,841 --> 00:48:01,439
- Work?
- Yes.

924
00:48:02,591 --> 00:48:04,094
It's amazing.

925
00:48:04,174 --> 00:48:05,265
Great.

926
00:48:15,928 --> 00:48:17,983
How long have you two been married?

927
00:48:22,522 --> 00:48:24,072
1 year - 6 months.

928
00:48:24,757 --> 00:48:25,981
6 months - 1 year.

929
00:48:28,007 --> 00:48:29,196
Great.

930
00:48:30,382 --> 00:48:31,610
See you then.

931
00:48:32,382 --> 00:48:33,880
Bye-bye, dear.

932
00:48:39,341 --> 00:48:41,344
- Mrs. Kohli.
- Yes.

933
00:48:41,424 --> 00:48:43,013
- Mrs. Kohli.
- Yes.

934
00:48:43,093 --> 00:48:45,589
Listen, Mrs. Kohli.

935
00:48:45,669 --> 00:48:47,344
What's wrong?

936
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:49,379
Didn't I tell you, Mrs. Kohli?

937
00:48:49,862 --> 00:48:52,448
I caught those two red-handed today.

938
00:48:52,789 --> 00:48:53,789
Yes..

939
00:48:53,829 --> 00:48:57,163
They have no clue how
long they've been married.

940
00:48:57,389 --> 00:49:00,532
Now it's Confirmed that they
are in a live-in relationship.

941
00:49:00,612 --> 00:49:03,140
And it's all that Nazeem Khan's fault.

942
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:05,407
People like them are an
embarrassment to the society.

943
00:49:05,487 --> 00:49:07,435
- Yes. And our neighborhood too.
- Yes..

944
00:49:07,515 --> 00:49:11,970
Mr. Kohli, now you must throw
those two out at the crack of dawn.

945
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:14,549
- We're dead.
- Yes we're dead.

946
00:49:14,632 --> 00:49:15,802
What now?

947
00:49:15,882 --> 00:49:18,308
We should've already decided
on how long we were married.

948
00:49:18,388 --> 00:49:19,852
You should've thought about it, Guddu.

949
00:49:19,876 --> 00:49:21,811
And, why can't you
ever give the same reply?

950
00:49:21,891 --> 00:49:24,862
If dad finds out any of this,
he'll bury you alive.

951
00:49:46,383 --> 00:49:48,813
- Respected people is living here.
- Right.

952
00:49:48,893 --> 00:49:51,900
- Decent people is living here.
- We must throw them out.

953
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:55,160
- We can't allow them here.
- This kind of people can't live here.

954
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:58,094
- Don't know how they come here?
- Take them out.

955
00:49:58,174 --> 00:50:00,344
Come. Lets see.

956
00:50:00,424 --> 00:50:02,969
Knock the door.

957
00:50:03,049 --> 00:50:06,767
- Call them out.
- Decent persons..

958
00:50:06,847 --> 00:50:09,886
You? And with all these people?

959
00:50:09,966 --> 00:50:11,742
- Please come in.
- Move aside.

960
00:50:11,822 --> 00:50:15,299
Come inside everyone
and see for yourself.

961
00:50:15,382 --> 00:50:16,515
Hello.

962
00:50:26,632 --> 00:50:28,306
They are married.

963
00:50:28,841 --> 00:50:30,049
Yes.

964
00:50:30,341 --> 00:50:31,467
They..

965
00:50:32,934 --> 00:50:33,934
They..

966
00:50:34,216 --> 00:50:35,811
They are married.

967
00:50:35,891 --> 00:50:38,216
I swear this wasn't here.

968
00:50:38,590 --> 00:50:41,007
And this was definitely not here.
Really.

969
00:50:41,087 --> 00:50:43,655
I swear on Ramanand Baba.
Honestly.

970
00:50:46,341 --> 00:50:47,658
He is lying.

971
00:50:49,047 --> 00:50:50,824
They are looking so cute here.

972
00:50:51,257 --> 00:50:53,060
Listen, dear.

973
00:51:07,203 --> 00:51:10,003
Wow..you all arrived
on a very nice day.

974
00:51:10,083 --> 00:51:11,008
Nice day?

975
00:51:11,088 --> 00:51:14,802
You see, today is our
first wedding anniversary.

976
00:51:15,666 --> 00:51:17,094
Have a sweet.

977
00:51:17,174 --> 00:51:18,832
Congratulations.

978
00:51:18,912 --> 00:51:21,439
Congratulations. Congratulations.

979
00:51:21,799 --> 00:51:24,943
- But she said..
- Have a sweet, aunty.

980
00:51:25,216 --> 00:51:26,466
Let's go.

981
00:51:26,549 --> 00:51:29,214
After all,
it's an auspicious day for us. Smile.

982
00:51:51,267 --> 00:51:53,924
- We just breezed through these 20 days.
- Right?

983
00:51:55,507 --> 00:51:58,269
These were the most
beautiful 20 days of my life.

984
00:51:59,049 --> 00:52:00,379
Mine too.

985
00:52:03,278 --> 00:52:05,880
I'm getting a very
strong feeling about this.

986
00:52:07,588 --> 00:52:10,412
Then what's the next step.

987
00:52:10,492 --> 00:52:12,016
Next step?

988
00:52:12,341 --> 00:52:13,684
What's that?

989
00:52:16,174 --> 00:52:19,067
Well, for starters it
can be what we came here for.

990
00:52:20,882 --> 00:52:22,277
We'll see.

991
00:52:25,508 --> 00:52:27,396
- Let's go.
- What's wrong?

992
00:52:27,966 --> 00:52:29,145
Nothing.

993
00:52:29,869 --> 00:52:31,735
Something's definitely wrong.
What is it?

994
00:52:33,601 --> 00:52:35,832
I did all this for you.

995
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:37,963
And you're saying that we'll see.

996
00:52:38,477 --> 00:52:40,514
I love you a lot, Rashmi.

997
00:52:41,007 --> 00:52:44,636
I've no clue how much
Lord Krishna loved Radha Rani.

998
00:52:44,716 --> 00:52:47,300
But I can bet you that
I don't love you any less.

999
00:52:47,909 --> 00:52:50,761
I've imagined my entire life with you.

1000
00:52:50,841 --> 00:52:52,924
And we look really happy.

1001
00:52:53,926 --> 00:52:56,295
But there's one thing
that always scares me.

1002
00:52:56,655 --> 00:52:59,279
What if you refuse to marry me?

1003
00:52:59,832 --> 00:53:02,191
Why do you feel that I'll say no?

1004
00:53:03,076 --> 00:53:04,289
I don't know.

1005
00:53:04,632 --> 00:53:06,560
What if the perfume fades away?

1006
00:53:06,925 --> 00:53:12,885
Even if it does,
you smell nice naturally.

1007
00:53:14,130 --> 00:53:16,217
I am not in the mood to joke, Rashmi.

1008
00:53:18,231 --> 00:53:19,681
Have you ever been to Jaipur?

1009
00:53:25,799 --> 00:53:28,295
It's the best place
for a destination wedding.

1010
00:53:32,304 --> 00:53:33,129
Is it?

1011
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:34,511
Jaipur.

1012
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:36,134
- Jaipur!
- Yes.

1013
00:53:39,023 --> 00:53:41,177
People are watching.
Control yourself.

1014
00:53:41,257 --> 00:53:42,761
How can I control myself?

1015
00:53:42,841 --> 00:53:45,132
I can hear the wedding bells.

1016
00:53:45,216 --> 00:53:46,926
Can't you ever slow down?

1017
00:53:47,712 --> 00:53:49,552
We leave for Mathura tomorrow.

1018
00:53:49,632 --> 00:53:51,387
Then talk to our parents.

1019
00:53:51,966 --> 00:53:54,338
And then you can imagine
all the wedding bells you want.

1020
00:54:02,938 --> 00:54:03,938
- Happy.
- Yes.

1021
00:54:04,007 --> 00:54:05,851
You came to Gwalior with me..

1022
00:54:05,931 --> 00:54:09,140
But you're always
busy staring at other females.

1023
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:11,967
- I am looking at the guy.
- Why?

1024
00:54:12,047 --> 00:54:13,799
Are you interested in them as well?

1025
00:54:13,882 --> 00:54:15,268
No. Hold this.

1026
00:54:26,093 --> 00:54:27,913
She's a married woman.

1027
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:31,424
Even I am married.
Or did you forget?

1028
00:54:31,507 --> 00:54:32,677
No.

1029
00:54:32,757 --> 00:54:34,386
Who is he?

1030
00:54:34,466 --> 00:54:36,261
Forget him, Bobby.

1031
00:54:36,341 --> 00:54:39,049
Fooling around with a married woman.

1032
00:54:39,129 --> 00:54:42,216
But I won't let you
have all the fun alone.

1033
00:54:42,299 --> 00:54:44,216
I want it too.

1034
00:54:44,299 --> 00:54:46,012
What do you want?

1035
00:54:48,259 --> 00:54:51,204
Go back to the hotel.
I'll see you an hour.

1036
00:54:54,469 --> 00:54:56,213
Make that two.

1037
00:54:57,629 --> 00:54:59,008
Shall we go?

1038
00:55:30,757 --> 00:55:32,615
Nice tires.

1039
00:55:49,507 --> 00:55:50,697
Happy Holi, aunty.

1040
00:55:50,777 --> 00:55:51,805
Holi?

1041
00:55:54,966 --> 00:55:55,966
Hi.

1042
00:56:15,049 --> 00:56:16,587
Mad man.

1043
00:56:20,424 --> 00:56:21,833
I'll get that.

1044
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:27,032
Yes?

1045
00:56:29,046 --> 00:56:31,697
Tell Guddu I am here.
And I want some too.

1046
00:56:32,507 --> 00:56:33,700
What do you want?

1047
00:56:34,174 --> 00:56:35,770
Same thing that Guddu..

1048
00:56:39,023 --> 00:56:40,118
Yes?

1049
00:56:41,341 --> 00:56:42,897
What do you want?

1050
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:48,796
Do you need a towel?

1051
00:56:49,144 --> 00:56:50,843
Are you okay?

1052
00:56:51,922 --> 00:56:53,157
What do you want?

1053
00:56:54,048 --> 00:56:55,697
What do you want?

1054
00:56:58,687 --> 00:57:01,048
- What do you want?
- It was some weird guy.

1055
00:57:01,128 --> 00:57:03,912
He took your name and
said he wants some too.

1056
00:57:04,507 --> 00:57:06,037
Took my name and ran away?

1057
00:57:07,438 --> 00:57:09,010
There's only one such man.

1058
00:57:10,049 --> 00:57:11,451
And he's in Mathura.

1059
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:24,469
<i>♪ When in love, no need to be afraid. ♪</i>

1060
00:57:24,549 --> 00:57:27,011
<i>♪ It's just love and not a sin. ♪</i>

1061
00:57:27,091 --> 00:57:29,150
<i>♪ So why be afraid at all. ♪</i>

1062
00:57:29,230 --> 00:57:31,633
<i>♪ When in love, no need to be afraid. ♪</i>

1063
00:57:31,713 --> 00:57:35,552
Guddu, come out fast.
<i>♪ When in love, no need to be afraid. ♪</i>

1064
00:57:35,632 --> 00:57:38,674
<i>♪ So why be afraid at all. ♪</i>

00:57:38,754 --> 00:57:42,586
<i>♪ When in love, no need to be afraid. ♪</i>

1067

1068

1069
00:57:51,335 --> 00:57:53,549
<i>♪ So why be afraid at all.. ♪</i>

1070
00:58:43,624 --> 00:58:45,237
We are ruined.

1071
00:58:55,063 --> 00:58:57,056
Vikas, remember what I said?

1072
00:58:57,429 --> 00:59:00,155
Your younger brother
will get married before you.

1073
00:59:00,235 --> 00:59:01,235
Now, look.

1074
00:59:01,266 --> 00:59:03,346
Now you'll have to spend
the rest of your life alone.

1075
00:59:04,032 --> 00:59:06,075
Didn't you feel ashamed
before doing any of this?

1076
00:59:06,155 --> 00:59:08,621
Did you ever think what will happen to me?

1077
00:59:08,701 --> 00:59:12,146
You rascal, you do. Stop look at her.
Look at me.

1078
00:59:12,226 --> 00:59:14,488
You wanted to get married, didn't you?
Didn't you?

1079
00:59:14,568 --> 00:59:15,707
Couldn't you wait for a few days?

1080
00:59:15,731 --> 00:59:17,449
Even I was getting some proposals.

1081
00:59:17,529 --> 00:59:19,539
Vikas! What is going on here?

1082
00:59:23,799 --> 00:59:24,879
Get out.

1083
00:59:33,798 --> 00:59:35,287
What is this?

1084
00:59:36,522 --> 00:59:38,040
You should know..

1085
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:41,290
That no one in Shukla family
has ever done such a thing.

1086
00:59:43,594 --> 00:59:46,272
Where the younger brother
got married before the older one.

1087
00:59:46,870 --> 00:59:50,407
Nor like the way you did,
who elopes and gets married.

1088
00:59:51,813 --> 00:59:54,597
But you wanted to change
the course of history, didn't you?

1089
00:59:55,217 --> 00:59:56,933
Which you did.

1090
00:59:57,757 --> 00:59:59,248
Are you happy now?

1091
00:59:59,833 --> 01:00:01,289
Why did you do such a thing?

1092
01:00:02,457 --> 01:00:04,610
Why did you run away and get married?

1093
01:00:05,833 --> 01:00:07,754
Such a nice girl.

1094
01:00:08,673 --> 01:00:10,295
I admit she's dressed
a little underdressed.

1095
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:14,432
But we would've given you permission
to marry her. You should've asked us once.

1096
01:00:14,512 --> 01:00:17,089
You could've told me once.

1097
01:00:26,462 --> 01:00:28,371
Look, mom, strawberry.

1098
01:00:29,112 --> 01:00:30,334
Cheeku. Jalshamoviez.

1099
01:00:32,438 --> 01:00:34,248
Guddu, shameless.

1100
01:00:35,881 --> 01:00:37,564
How can you leave this thing lying around?

1101
01:00:38,467 --> 01:00:39,939
I didn't expect this from you.

1102
01:00:42,410 --> 01:00:44,455
Imagine our reputation in society now.

1103
01:00:44,535 --> 01:00:46,330
Enough about your reputation.

1104
01:00:46,410 --> 01:00:48,189
Think about my poor Vikas.

1105
01:00:48,269 --> 01:00:49,705
His life's ruined.

1106
01:00:49,785 --> 01:00:51,146
He'll die a bachelor now.

1107
01:00:51,226 --> 01:00:53,664
Very sad.

1108
01:00:53,744 --> 01:00:57,289
- Whatever happened wasn't fair?
- Get lost!

1109
01:00:58,035 --> 01:01:00,914
There's no way brother
Vikas can face anyone now.

1110
01:01:00,994 --> 01:01:02,205
You bloody..

1111
01:01:02,285 --> 01:01:03,872
Will, you two shut up?

1112
01:01:03,952 --> 01:01:06,930
This is our personal matter.
So please don't interfere.

1113
01:01:07,010 --> 01:01:08,789
Stop yelling at my brother.

1114
01:01:08,869 --> 01:01:10,455
What's done is done?

1115
01:01:10,535 --> 01:01:14,548
Now we need to ask her whether she
can handle the household chores or not.

1116
01:01:14,628 --> 01:01:16,579
Be quiet, sister-in-law.
Be quiet!

1117
01:01:17,619 --> 01:01:18,973
And why can't he speak?

1118
01:01:19,327 --> 01:01:21,414
What family? Which family.

1119
01:01:21,494 --> 01:01:24,455
A family where the younger brother
has no respect for his older brother.

1120
01:01:24,535 --> 01:01:26,050
Thank God Babulal informed us on time..

1121
01:01:26,074 --> 01:01:27,955
Because he was planning
on eloping with her.

1122
01:01:28,035 --> 01:01:30,242
Look. His bag's packed.

1123
01:01:32,452 --> 01:01:33,850
How did this happen?

1124
01:01:41,546 --> 01:01:44,176
Where to, Mr. Khan? You were
the only one missing in the picture.

1125
01:01:44,256 --> 01:01:45,077
Please.

1126
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:46,595
Didn't you bring your
camera along this time?

1127
01:01:46,619 --> 01:01:47,802
Abbas.

1128
01:01:49,244 --> 01:01:50,402
Abbas.

1129
01:01:51,244 --> 01:01:52,993
So you knew all about this.

1130
01:01:54,130 --> 01:01:56,005
I am asking you a question.
Did you know?

1131
01:01:56,702 --> 01:01:58,793
- Yes.
- There you go.

1132
01:01:58,873 --> 01:02:02,204
Everyone knows except for our family.

1133
01:02:02,952 --> 01:02:04,720
Stop staring at her.
We know the entire story.

1134
01:02:04,744 --> 01:02:06,385
We're just missing your version.

1135
01:02:07,118 --> 01:02:09,244
At least you could've told us.

1136
01:02:09,327 --> 01:02:12,010
Or at least stopped them
from doing such a thing.

1137
01:02:13,076 --> 01:02:14,964
What could I have possibly said?

1138
01:02:17,372 --> 01:02:20,574
All I can say is that
we forget what happened.

1139
01:02:20,996 --> 01:02:22,705
And forgive them.

1140
01:02:22,785 --> 01:02:24,607
And get these two married.

1141
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:26,586
Marriage.

1142
01:02:27,369 --> 01:02:28,655
Have you lost your mind?

1143
01:02:28,917 --> 01:02:30,806
How can we get them married again?

1144
01:02:32,031 --> 01:02:33,581
Are you on drugs or something?

1145
01:02:33,661 --> 01:02:35,497
You mean they won't get married.

1146
01:02:35,577 --> 01:02:36,830
Have you lost your mind?

1147
01:02:36,910 --> 01:02:39,303
When they are already married,
they why get them married again?

1148
01:02:39,327 --> 01:02:40,356
Right.

1149
01:02:40,910 --> 01:02:42,035
Married?

1150
01:02:42,994 --> 01:02:44,307
When?

1151
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:50,580
Oh yes, they are already married.
See.. See..

1152
01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:52,164
See this picture, this frame.

1153
01:02:52,244 --> 01:02:54,164
They took their wedding vows before me.

1154
01:02:54,244 --> 01:02:56,042
But unfortunately, none of you were there.

1155
01:02:57,559 --> 01:03:04,865
I mean get them married
again for your sake and society.

1156
01:03:06,994 --> 01:03:09,330
They just need your blessings.

1157
01:03:09,410 --> 01:03:11,414
Yes, do that.

1158
01:03:11,494 --> 01:03:12,539
This is right.

1159
01:03:12,619 --> 01:03:14,455
We just need your blessings, mother.

1160
01:03:14,535 --> 01:03:19,327
And anyway, aunty, no wedding is complete
without the blessings of the parents.

1161
01:03:19,410 --> 01:03:21,796
Will you two shut up?

1162
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:24,452
You didn't tell us anything
about your parents?

1163
01:03:24,994 --> 01:03:25,994
Who are they?

1164
01:03:26,346 --> 01:03:27,259
Yes..

1165
01:03:27,339 --> 01:03:28,231
Yes.

1166
01:03:28,311 --> 01:03:29,311
Who?

1167
01:03:30,736 --> 01:03:31,736
That..

1168
01:03:39,327 --> 01:03:41,164
I had warned you about this.

1169
01:03:41,244 --> 01:03:43,289
But my fears turned out to be true.

1170
01:03:43,369 --> 01:03:45,875
What on earth have you done, Rashmi?

1171
01:03:45,955 --> 01:03:48,382
Didn't you think about
your father's reputation?

1172
01:03:48,709 --> 01:03:50,039
Elections are around the corner..

1173
01:03:50,119 --> 01:03:52,943
We'll become a laughing
stock all over the city.

1174
01:03:53,707 --> 01:03:59,327
And you said Shrikant, I'll be
the next MP, the next Minister, the CM.

1175
01:03:59,407 --> 01:04:03,372
But now when they fire you from the party,
all your dreams will be shattered.

1176
01:04:03,452 --> 01:04:05,039
I am feeling dizzy.

1177
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:06,787
It's all over now, uncle.

1178
01:04:07,202 --> 01:04:11,145
Dear, what have you done?

1179
01:04:11,319 --> 01:04:12,443
What have you done?

1180
01:04:12,523 --> 01:04:14,789
Aunty is crying.

1181
01:04:14,869 --> 01:04:17,729
You could've told us once.

1182
01:04:18,657 --> 01:04:22,372
He's such a nice boy,
such a nice family.

1183
01:04:22,745 --> 01:04:24,497
You should've tried telling us once.

1184
01:04:24,577 --> 01:04:27,007
We would've let you marry him.

1185
01:04:35,369 --> 01:04:37,787
- I've something to say.
- Here comes the bad luck.

1186
01:04:38,597 --> 01:04:40,915
I know none of this is right.

1187
01:04:41,619 --> 01:04:43,323
But all is not lost yet.

1188
01:04:46,997 --> 01:04:51,265
For your sake,
and for the sake of society..

1189
01:04:51,345 --> 01:04:53,335
You should get them married again.

1190
01:04:53,744 --> 01:04:54,954
What say?

1191
01:04:55,285 --> 01:04:57,202
- What is he saying?
- Best idea.

1192
01:04:58,285 --> 01:04:59,956
- Come closer.
- Yes.

1193
01:05:06,723 --> 01:05:09,026
In our culture,
marriage is a one-time affair.

1194
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:11,863
And they are already married, understand.

1195
01:05:13,369 --> 01:05:15,929
But uncle, how are we going
to explain any of this to the people.

1196
01:05:16,452 --> 01:05:17,692
Like when did they get married?

1197
01:05:17,744 --> 01:05:19,372
Why didn't we inform anyone?

1198
01:05:19,452 --> 01:05:21,500
We've been promoting
our culture for ages now..

1199
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:24,652
But your very own daughter
just put all your efforts to waste.

1200
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:29,289
I'm telling you, we've been cursed
by all the lovers that we humiliated.

1201
01:05:29,369 --> 01:05:34,035
The highest leader of Culture Protection
Party, Vishnu Prasad Trivedi's daughter..

1202
01:05:34,119 --> 01:05:35,830
Eloped and got married.

1203
01:05:35,910 --> 01:05:37,154
This is going to create a stir.

1204
01:05:37,234 --> 01:05:38,845
There will be no such thing.

1205
01:05:39,285 --> 01:05:41,026
Keep your mouth shut.

1206
01:05:47,834 --> 01:05:50,442
I know how to tell the people about this?

1207
01:05:50,522 --> 01:05:52,239
They eloped and got married.

1208
01:05:52,319 --> 01:05:54,119
Well, at least they are married..

1209
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:59,005
And not in a live-in relationship
like that idiot Nazeem Khan.

1210
01:06:01,248 --> 01:06:02,703
- Yes.
- Yes.

1211
01:06:03,112 --> 01:06:04,192
Sir..

1212
01:06:06,244 --> 01:06:09,463
What if we were in a live-in relationship?

1213
01:06:09,543 --> 01:06:11,188
You are telling this in front of Uncle.

1214
01:06:11,268 --> 01:06:13,664
I will hit you with the slippers.

1215
01:06:15,164 --> 01:06:16,242
What is he saying?

1216
01:06:25,287 --> 01:06:28,684
Then a number of bodies would
be floating in the Yamuna River.

1217
01:06:30,906 --> 01:06:33,372
- Count them.
- It' total 6.

1218
01:06:33,452 --> 01:06:34,688
So many.

1219
01:06:35,660 --> 01:06:36,858
Understand.

1220
01:06:38,535 --> 01:06:39,678
- Shrikant.
- Yes, uncle.

1221
01:06:39,758 --> 01:06:40,820
Come here.

1222
01:06:41,866 --> 01:06:44,639
I don't want to see that guy again.

1223
01:06:44,719 --> 01:06:47,164
- Understood?
- Yes uncle.

1224
01:06:56,244 --> 01:06:57,554
Hey listen.

1225
01:06:57,634 --> 01:06:59,538
No.. I'm not talking with you.

1226
01:07:08,883 --> 01:07:14,205
We're in conversation with the ex-MP
and Mathura Chief Mr. Vishnu Trivedi.

1227
01:07:14,285 --> 01:07:15,827
Let's begin our conversation with him.

1228
01:07:15,910 --> 01:07:17,619
It's a very happy day for him..

1229
01:07:17,702 --> 01:07:21,119
Because it's the wedding
of his only daughter Rashmi.

1230
01:07:21,202 --> 01:07:22,285
It's done. It's done.

1231
01:07:22,365 --> 01:07:23,470
- They just got married.
- They did?

1232
01:07:23,494 --> 01:07:24,494
Yes.

1233
01:07:25,369 --> 01:07:27,077
So, Vishnu sir, my question to you is..

1234
01:07:27,157 --> 01:07:28,958
How do you feel after this wedding?

1235
01:07:29,202 --> 01:07:31,898
It feels really nice.
It feels really very nice.

1236
01:07:33,001 --> 01:07:39,048
My dear daughter is married
to a very talented young man Bunnu..

1237
01:07:39,128 --> 01:07:40,205
Guddu Shukla.

1238
01:07:40,285 --> 01:07:42,239
With Guddu Shukla.

1239
01:07:43,369 --> 01:07:47,546
Frankly, we received many
proposals for our daughter.

1240
01:07:47,790 --> 01:07:49,578
From rich families.

1241
01:07:49,816 --> 01:07:51,369
There was a long queue.

1242
01:07:51,627 --> 01:07:55,829
But I wanted my daughter
to marry someone from a poor family.

1243
01:07:55,909 --> 01:07:56,962
Yes right.

1244
01:07:57,042 --> 01:07:58,783
They are very poor people.

1245
01:08:00,119 --> 01:08:05,556
But as you know that I don't
believe in caste, creed, or community.

1246
01:08:05,636 --> 01:08:08,013
But the boy's from Brahmin family..

1247
01:08:08,093 --> 01:08:11,405
And they have a huge
saree shop in Mathura Market.

1248
01:08:12,285 --> 01:08:14,800
Pardon my insolence,
but I do have a question, sir.

1249
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:15,619
Yes, of course.

1250
01:08:15,699 --> 01:08:17,713
It's your only daughter's marriage..

1251
01:08:17,793 --> 01:08:19,560
And you didn't invite anyone.

1252
01:08:26,492 --> 01:08:33,399
Because, my father,
Late Dwarkadas Trivedi's dying wish..

1253
01:08:33,479 --> 01:08:36,619
His last wish was that
his granddaughter's wedding..

1254
01:08:36,702 --> 01:08:40,429
- Should be a private affair.
- Right.

1255
01:08:40,509 --> 01:08:42,039
A personal affair, understand.

1256
01:08:42,119 --> 01:08:44,306
Why did he have such a weird last wish?

1257
01:08:46,244 --> 01:08:47,481
We don't know.

1258
01:08:47,779 --> 01:08:49,285
Why don't you ask him personally?

1259
01:08:49,619 --> 01:08:50,789
Shall I?

1260
01:08:50,869 --> 01:08:52,746
No..I get it.

1261
01:08:54,849 --> 01:08:56,099
Stupid.

1262
01:08:58,502 --> 01:08:59,526
Ask him.

1263
01:09:08,244 --> 01:09:09,674
- Priest.
- Yes.

1264
01:09:09,995 --> 01:09:13,184
The groom's here, so is the bride,
the garlands and the guests.

1265
01:09:13,621 --> 01:09:17,539
So shall we take our wedding vows?

1266
01:09:17,619 --> 01:09:18,659
Go ahead.

1267
01:09:19,202 --> 01:09:20,895
But who's going chant the verses?

1268
01:09:21,327 --> 01:09:23,206
Why sir, can't you?

1269
01:09:23,737 --> 01:09:26,122
I only look like a priest,
but I am not one.

1270
01:09:26,202 --> 01:09:28,122
I sell fritters outside.

1271
01:09:28,202 --> 01:09:30,393
Shrikant sir called
me in a hurry and said..

1272
01:09:30,473 --> 01:09:33,037
I should walk out
with you two when he calls.

1273
01:09:35,077 --> 01:09:36,119
The wedding's done.

1274
01:09:36,202 --> 01:09:38,122
- Hey fake priest, get them here.
- Yes, brother.

1275
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:40,742
You both are married now.
Take the blessings of parents.

1276
01:09:40,822 --> 01:09:43,798
Come on hurry up.

1277
01:09:44,383 --> 01:09:46,764
You're the bride and groom,
so show that you're happy.

1278
01:09:46,844 --> 01:09:48,474
This is not a funeral. Smile.

1279
01:09:48,554 --> 01:09:50,705
Come on fast.

1280
01:09:50,785 --> 01:09:54,256
Our Rashmi's husband and
our brother-in-law is here.

1281
01:09:54,336 --> 01:09:56,244
Now everything will be okay.

1282
01:09:56,324 --> 01:09:58,335
Gentlemen, they are married now.

1283
01:09:58,415 --> 01:10:01,372
Now you can come and bless
the couple in any way you wish.

1284
01:10:01,452 --> 01:10:03,819
- Congratulations. Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

1285
01:10:04,435 --> 01:10:06,555
- Congratulations. Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

1286
01:10:06,986 --> 01:10:07,744
Hello.

1287
01:10:07,827 --> 01:10:09,599
Come on, that's all.

1288
01:10:09,679 --> 01:10:11,973
Come on smile now.

1289
01:10:33,328 --> 01:10:35,354
Come on, that's all.
Let's go, let's go.

1290
01:10:37,327 --> 01:10:38,327
Come on.

1291
01:10:43,780 --> 01:10:46,341
Cry. It's your send off. Cry.

1292
01:10:49,401 --> 01:10:52,147
Our daughter's leaving us.

1293
01:10:53,156 --> 01:10:55,146
Uncle shed some tears.

1294
01:10:56,396 --> 01:10:58,036
My dear daughter..

1295
01:11:03,884 --> 01:11:05,986
Please take care of her.

1296
01:11:06,066 --> 01:11:07,863
Cry. Cry.

1297
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:11,840
Take their blessings.

1298
01:11:13,327 --> 01:11:14,404
Father.

1299
01:11:15,744 --> 01:11:17,854
Take care of our daughter.

1300
01:11:21,202 --> 01:11:22,247
Bless you, dear.

1301
01:11:22,327 --> 01:11:24,621
Don't cry. Don't cry. Let's go.

1302
01:11:26,869 --> 01:11:28,169
Uncle!

1303
01:11:28,785 --> 01:11:29,785
Bye.

1304
01:11:31,202 --> 01:11:32,994
Please stop her.

1305
01:11:33,994 --> 01:11:35,037
Be quiet.

1306
01:11:36,410 --> 01:11:39,111
Please stop her, uncle.

1307
01:11:41,518 --> 01:11:42,681
Bye. Bye.

1308
01:11:55,544 --> 01:11:57,737

Go.. Go..

1333
01:14:42,210 --> 01:14:43,590
Careful.

1334
01:14:43,670 --> 01:14:45,247
Go.. Go..

1335
01:14:45,327 --> 01:14:47,593
Tell us in the morning?

1336
01:14:58,435 --> 01:15:00,102
Ankita now your turn.

1337
01:15:00,185 --> 01:15:03,062
Ankita don't cheat,
are your eyes closed.

1338
01:15:03,546 --> 01:15:09,136
- Pappu, Rani, Pinki.. Let's go.
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5..

1339
01:15:09,216 --> 01:15:11,159
You were amazing yesterday. Dear.

1340
01:15:11,239 --> 01:15:13,557
So were you, mother.

1341
01:15:16,544 --> 01:15:18,021
Are you guys ready?

1342
01:15:18,101 --> 01:15:20,518
- Back early today, son.
- I am coming.

1343
01:15:20,598 --> 01:15:22,162
Yes, mom. It was a lazy day at work.

1344
01:15:26,477 --> 01:15:29,109
Rashmi, why did you go with him?

1345
01:15:30,102 --> 01:15:31,821
You should go to work as well.

1346
01:15:35,310 --> 01:15:38,352
What's wrong with you, dear?

1347
01:15:38,928 --> 01:15:44,147
I've been noticing that you stay pretty
reserved in yourself since you got her.

1348
01:15:44,227 --> 01:15:48,525
- If any of it is our fault, then..
- Not at all, mom. What are you saying?

1349
01:15:48,846 --> 01:15:50,778
I am absolutely fine.

1350
01:15:51,643 --> 01:15:53,522
Guddu, is something wrong?

1351
01:15:53,602 --> 01:15:55,559
No, mom.
Why do you think like that?

1352
01:15:56,477 --> 01:15:59,583
We got married in such haste,
so she is just tired.

1353
01:15:59,663 --> 01:16:00,393
Yes.

1354
01:16:00,477 --> 01:16:02,765
And our house is so congested..

1355
01:16:03,310 --> 01:16:05,661
- Which she's not used to.
- Yes.

1356
01:16:06,310 --> 01:16:09,549
But son,
whatever happened, I am happy.

1357
01:16:10,060 --> 01:16:11,283
Honestly speaking..

1358
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:15,986
Even I could've never found
such a beautiful bride for Guddu.

1359
01:16:16,066 --> 01:16:17,188
Isn't it?

1360
01:16:17,268 --> 01:16:19,268
She's one in a million.

1361
01:16:24,058 --> 01:16:27,688
Don't be sad, dear.
Let's forget what happened.

1362
01:16:27,768 --> 01:16:29,768
You two are newly married..

1363
01:16:29,852 --> 01:16:31,252
So learn to enjoy these moments.

1364
01:16:31,282 --> 01:16:32,761
These moments will never come back.

1365
01:16:33,018 --> 01:16:34,435
And once you have kids..

1366
01:16:34,518 --> 01:16:39,102
Then you'll hardly get
the opportunity to be a wife again.

1367
01:16:40,948 --> 01:16:42,810
Did I say something wrong?

1368
01:16:42,893 --> 01:16:45,188
- Not at all, I..
- No, no..she..

1369
01:16:45,268 --> 01:16:47,650
- She can't cook.
- Cooking problem.

1370
01:16:47,730 --> 01:16:48,735
Yes.

1371
01:16:49,435 --> 01:16:50,480
Silly girl.

1372
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:54,398
Women are not made for
only cooking and cleaning.

1373
01:16:55,346 --> 01:16:57,477
And why do you have to cook?

1374
01:16:58,060 --> 01:17:00,096
You're from such a nice
family and educated as well.

1375
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:03,897
You should go out.
Anyone can cook, dear.

1376
01:17:03,977 --> 01:17:05,461
Absolutely right, aunty.

1377
01:17:05,810 --> 01:17:09,352
In fact, she's much
more educated than him.

1378
01:17:09,435 --> 01:17:10,675
- Really?
- Yes.

1379
01:17:10,755 --> 01:17:14,542
In fact, she should go
to work and Guddu should cook.

1380
01:17:14,773 --> 01:17:15,773
Right?

1381
01:17:15,977 --> 01:17:19,215
Yes. At least we'll
get some good food.

1382
01:17:20,069 --> 01:17:21,459
So it's decided.

1383
01:17:21,539 --> 01:17:24,080
Guddu will cook,
and daughter-in-law will go to work.

1384
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:25,477
- Done.
- Fine.

1385
01:17:25,685 --> 01:17:27,813
- And we'll sit and home and eat.
- Right.

1386
01:17:27,893 --> 01:17:30,309
Come on. Give that to me.

1387
01:17:33,228 --> 01:17:35,772
You two sit.
I'll finish my chores.

1388
01:17:35,852 --> 01:17:37,967
- Janki.
- Yes, mom.

1389
01:17:38,047 --> 01:17:39,195
Here you go.

1390
01:17:40,060 --> 01:17:43,813
Frankly speaking, it's hard to find
a mother-in-law like her in this age.

1391
01:17:43,893 --> 01:17:47,215
- Rashmi is very lucky, isn't it?
- I can't do this.

1392
01:17:49,390 --> 01:17:51,399
What are we doing?

1393
01:17:54,355 --> 01:17:57,410
Your parents have
accepted me so easily.

1394
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:01,765
They love me like a daughter,
even more.

1395
01:18:03,435 --> 01:18:05,230
And what am I doing?

1396
01:18:07,599 --> 01:18:09,664
I've been deceiving them.

1397
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:12,857
This charade.

1398
01:18:17,060 --> 01:18:21,106
I never imagined that the weight
of this lie could get so taxing.

1399
01:18:24,393 --> 01:18:26,518
I am so full of guilt inside.

1400
01:18:29,254 --> 01:18:32,338
Technically speaking we're
still in a live-in relationship..

1401
01:18:33,927 --> 01:18:37,727
But our's is the only one in the world
where the entire family's living together.

1402
01:18:39,810 --> 01:18:41,340
This is not right.

1403
01:18:43,819 --> 01:18:45,554
Do something, Guddu, please.

1404
01:18:46,935 --> 01:18:49,933
We were planning to get
married when we got back.

1405
01:18:51,503 --> 01:18:53,560
So let's get married
somewhere secretly.

1406
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:55,201
And no one will know.

1407
01:18:56,396 --> 01:18:58,727
I cannot live the rest
of my life like this.

1408
01:19:01,352 --> 01:19:02,940
Please do something.

1409
01:19:14,276 --> 01:19:15,621
Abbas, listen.

1410
01:19:15,701 --> 01:19:18,746
Remember the temple on the hill..

1411
01:19:18,826 --> 01:19:22,420
The one where we reported weeping
sounds can be heard every night. Yes.

1412
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:23,542
Go there tomorrow.

1413
01:19:23,622 --> 01:19:25,356
Give the priest 1100
rupees and tell him..

1414
01:19:25,436 --> 01:19:27,311
That two people will
come there to get married.

1415
01:19:27,335 --> 01:19:28,727
He'll make all the arrangements.

1416
01:19:28,807 --> 01:19:31,268
But he recognizes your face.

1417
01:19:31,352 --> 01:19:34,626
Don't worry,
Just tell him a different name.

1418
01:19:34,706 --> 01:19:35,762
Okay.

1419
01:19:41,908 --> 01:19:45,867
One happy family.

1420
01:19:47,355 --> 01:19:48,355
Get off.

1421
01:19:50,977 --> 01:19:52,559
What? Don't look at me.

1422
01:20:06,268 --> 01:20:08,522
- Cheeku.
- Yes, uncle.

1423
01:20:08,602 --> 01:20:11,230
- What are you doing here?
- I am hiding here.

1424
01:20:11,310 --> 01:20:13,022
We're playing hide and seek.

1425
01:20:13,102 --> 01:20:15,016
Hide and seek?

1426
01:20:16,798 --> 01:20:20,352
Did you hear any of our conversations?

1427
01:20:20,432 --> 01:20:22,711
- I did, I heard everything.
- What?

1428
01:20:23,473 --> 01:20:25,727
We were just joking, son.

1429
01:20:25,810 --> 01:20:29,902
Aunty, I might be a kid,
but I'm not stupid.

1430
01:20:30,228 --> 01:20:32,852
I understood everything,
that you two aren't married..

1431
01:20:32,935 --> 01:20:35,105
And just making
a fool out of everyone.

1432
01:20:35,185 --> 01:20:37,102
And you're going
to get married secretly.

1433
01:20:37,182 --> 01:20:38,526
Isn't that right, uncle?

1434
01:20:44,807 --> 01:20:48,926
Uncle I was playing hide and seek,
but you got caught red handed.

1435
01:20:49,006 --> 01:20:50,484
Okay, come.

1436
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:52,280
Let go.

1437
01:20:52,810 --> 01:20:55,060
- Cheeku, whose is that?
- It's mine.

1438
01:20:55,140 --> 01:20:57,230
Guddu uncle bought it for me.

1439
01:20:57,310 --> 01:20:58,772
His wedding gift.

1440
01:20:58,852 --> 01:21:00,642
Looks expensive.

1441
01:21:00,722 --> 01:21:03,587
- It's worth 8000, grandpa.
- 8000?

1442
01:21:03,667 --> 01:21:04,994
Why did you have to
buy such an expensive one?

1443
01:21:05,018 --> 01:21:06,578
You should've brought
something cheaper.

1444
01:21:06,851 --> 01:21:08,250
It's all right.

1445
01:21:09,101 --> 01:21:10,546
He's just a kid.

1446
01:21:11,077 --> 01:21:12,768
And he wanted a cycle for a long time..

1447
01:21:12,852 --> 01:21:14,511
So I thought I'll buy it for him.

1448
01:21:14,591 --> 01:21:16,602
But he never wanted a cycle.

1449
01:21:17,143 --> 01:21:20,063
He wanted a video game.
That too worth 500 rupees.

1450
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:21,477
Isn't Cheeku?

1451
01:21:21,557 --> 01:21:23,813
I'll get that too pretty soon,
grandpa.

1452
01:21:23,893 --> 01:21:27,950
And too worth 2500, right uncle?

1453
01:21:38,288 --> 01:21:39,900
Glory to Goddess!

1454
01:21:41,872 --> 01:21:43,890
Oh, God. Why on earth
did you bring me here?

1455
01:21:43,970 --> 01:21:44,970
Why? What happened?

1456
01:21:45,027 --> 01:21:46,519
Those guys belong to
my father's Political party.

1457
01:21:46,543 --> 01:21:47,908
They know me.

1458
01:21:47,988 --> 01:21:49,726
Oh, God. Cover your face. Cover your face.

1459
01:21:49,806 --> 01:21:50,872
Yes. Okay.

1460
01:21:51,227 --> 01:21:52,804
- And don't take it off.
- Okay.

1461
01:21:53,643 --> 01:21:54,772
- Wait a minute.
- Yes.

1462
01:21:54,852 --> 01:21:57,755
If they are your party workers,
then they know me too.

1463
01:21:57,835 --> 01:22:00,022
I am your father's
son-in-law after all.

1464
01:22:00,102 --> 01:22:02,582
Even your own parents won't
recognize you in this stupid beard.

1465
01:22:02,643 --> 01:22:03,977
What will happen if they sees me?

1466
01:22:04,060 --> 01:22:06,206
Couldn't you find a different temple?

1467
01:22:06,286 --> 01:22:07,703
Couldn't you find a different father?

1468
01:22:07,727 --> 01:22:09,688
His henchmen are
always lurking around.

1469
01:22:09,768 --> 01:22:11,568
There are more than
4000 temples in Vrindavan.

1470
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:13,013
Did you expect me to
check all of them overnight?

1471
01:22:13,037 --> 01:22:15,557
You could've at least checked
the temple we were supposed to go.

1472
01:22:17,026 --> 01:22:18,480
Fine, let's go.

1473
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:19,560
Let's go.

1474
01:22:26,511 --> 01:22:27,936
Where is he?

1475
01:22:28,393 --> 01:22:29,597
Priest.

1476
01:22:30,862 --> 01:22:32,310
Rahul and Damayanti?

1477
01:22:32,973 --> 01:22:35,102
- No. Ranveer/Damayanti.
- No!

1478
01:22:35,477 --> 01:22:36,635
Damyanti.

1479
01:22:36,799 --> 01:22:38,560
You're Ranveer and I'm Damayanti!

1480
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:39,784
Sit. Sit.

1481
01:22:41,235 --> 01:22:42,276
Priest.

1482
01:23:43,296 --> 01:23:46,224
Now grace her forehead
with this vermillion.

1483
01:23:56,762 --> 01:23:59,861
She is already married. Look at her.

1484
01:24:01,043 --> 01:24:02,560
She's already married.

1485
01:24:03,099 --> 01:24:05,560
You made me commit a sin,
you bloody rascal.

1486
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:08,227
Calm down, priest.
This is a mistake.

1487
01:24:08,310 --> 01:24:09,780
- She isn't married.
- Yes.

1488
01:24:11,476 --> 01:24:13,225
Ashok, Rajan.

1489
01:24:13,606 --> 01:24:15,366
What's the matter, Priest?

1490
01:24:16,267 --> 01:24:18,438
Look what he's making me do?

1491
01:24:18,518 --> 01:24:20,724
He made me commit blasphemy..

1492
01:24:20,804 --> 01:24:22,678
By getting him married
to a married woman.

1493
01:24:22,758 --> 01:24:25,286
- I am off to take a dip in the river.
- Rascal. What's your name?

1494
01:24:25,310 --> 01:24:28,105
- Ranveer.
- Ranveer or Shahid.

1495
01:24:28,185 --> 01:24:31,294
Listen to me, mister.
Listen, mister, I am not married.

1496
01:24:31,374 --> 01:24:33,763
We were just practicing.

1497
01:24:33,843 --> 01:24:37,412
Listen, lady, religion is
not something you can toy with.

1498
01:24:37,492 --> 01:24:38,727
You should be ashamed!

1499
01:24:38,807 --> 01:24:42,048
You're lucky that
we don't abuse women.

1500
01:24:42,128 --> 01:24:44,129
Now please leave.

1501
01:24:45,705 --> 01:24:46,728
Go on.

1502
01:24:54,146 --> 01:24:56,573
Mister, I wasn't trying
to insult the Hindu religion..

1503
01:24:56,798 --> 01:24:59,159
Nor the culture of our country.

1504
01:24:59,434 --> 01:25:02,397
I love my country and my religion.

1505
01:25:02,477 --> 01:25:05,686
There is no other culture
in this world like ours.

1506
01:25:07,958 --> 01:25:14,095
'Where golden birds perch on each
and every branch..'

1507
01:25:14,175 --> 01:25:17,283
'..that's my beloved India!'

1508
01:25:17,363 --> 01:25:22,852
'Long live India!'

1509
01:25:28,544 --> 01:25:31,924
Brother Vikas,
take a good/strong Banarasi sari..

1510
01:25:32,004 --> 01:25:34,893
From your shop and hang yourself from it.
Why?

1511
01:25:34,977 --> 01:25:38,397
Guddu's getting married again
while you're still a bachelor.

1512
01:25:38,477 --> 01:25:40,917
I can't get married once,
and he's getting married every week.

1513
01:25:44,268 --> 01:25:46,147
- Where is he?
- Where is he?

1514
01:25:47,102 --> 01:25:48,308
Here I am, brother.

1515
01:25:48,716 --> 01:25:52,268
Rascal, didn't you feel ashamed?

1516
01:25:52,706 --> 01:25:55,685
I never imagined you'll
turn out to be such a rascal.

1517
01:25:55,768 --> 01:25:56,938
Who was that female?

1518
01:25:57,018 --> 01:25:59,060
And how did you grow
a beard overnight?

1519
01:25:59,143 --> 01:26:02,217
Looking at his actions,
he's got to hide his face.

1520
01:26:02,518 --> 01:26:03,994
The older brother's still unmarried..

1521
01:26:04,018 --> 01:26:06,138
And the younger one's
walking down the aisle again.

1522
01:26:06,185 --> 01:26:09,288
He was trying to
marry a married woman.

1523
01:26:09,368 --> 01:26:10,808
- A married woman?
- A married woman?

1524
01:26:11,852 --> 01:26:13,747
- With a married woman?
- Let's go.

1525
01:26:15,066 --> 01:26:18,995
A married woman is someone's wife,
someone's pride and honor.

1526
01:26:19,075 --> 01:26:21,422
He's trying to break someone's home.

1527
01:26:22,143 --> 01:26:24,688
Why aren't you saying something?

1528
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:27,397
Why are you doing this?
Why you are doing?

1529
01:26:27,477 --> 01:26:29,336
Look, first,
you got married outside our knowledge..

1530
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:30,560
But we didn't say anything.

1531
01:26:30,630 --> 01:26:33,477
And now you're getting married again.
What's wrong with you, Guddu?

1532
01:26:33,557 --> 01:26:36,386
- What is all this, son?
- What is all this?

1533
01:26:36,727 --> 01:26:40,660
What is all this?
Don't you get it?

1534
01:26:41,210 --> 01:26:44,563
- Speak up or else..
- No! No!

1535
01:26:44,643 --> 01:26:46,909
Are you out of your mind?

1536
01:26:47,298 --> 01:26:51,147
Grandma, I'll settle for
that 500 rupees video game.

1537
01:26:51,227 --> 01:26:52,466
Don't interfere.

1538
01:26:52,893 --> 01:26:58,890
Honestly,
I feel pity for that poor child.

1539
01:26:58,970 --> 01:27:00,813
I am worried about her.

1540
01:27:00,893 --> 01:27:02,643
I am telling you..

1541
01:27:02,727 --> 01:27:08,277
If her father finds out about
his antics, he will finish us all.

1542
01:27:08,518 --> 01:27:09,777
The end.

1543
01:27:11,227 --> 01:27:13,560
- Mother. Father.
- Look at her.

1544
01:27:13,643 --> 01:27:15,244
How much more are you
going to make us all suffer?

1545
01:27:15,268 --> 01:27:16,708
He won't learn his lesson like this.

1546
01:27:16,967 --> 01:27:18,622
No, no.

1547
01:27:18,702 --> 01:27:21,033
I apologize, brother.
It was a mistake.

1548
01:27:21,373 --> 01:27:23,654
I ate something on the way, and now
I am not in my senses.

1549
01:27:25,418 --> 01:27:27,230
Just one request.

1550
01:27:27,310 --> 01:27:29,643
You can scold me all you want,
but at home.

1551
01:27:29,727 --> 01:27:31,813
Don't make a scene out here.

1552
01:27:31,893 --> 01:27:33,694
The veneration will start soon, and
people will start to gather around.

1553
01:27:33,718 --> 01:27:36,119
- Take me home. Please take me home.
- Let's go. Come on, let's go.

1554
01:27:36,143 --> 01:27:38,625
- Come on. Let's take him home.
- We'll beat him once we get home.

1555
01:27:38,649 --> 01:27:39,724
I'll not spare you.

1556
01:27:40,386 --> 01:27:44,601
- Let's go home..
- You shut up.

1557
01:27:44,681 --> 01:27:45,813
Quiet.

1558
01:27:45,893 --> 01:27:47,268
- Let's go, Vikas.
- Leave me.

1559
01:27:47,352 --> 01:27:49,149
- We'll beat him.
- Wear your slippers.

1560
01:27:49,398 --> 01:27:50,460
Hail lord!

1561
01:27:52,852 --> 01:27:54,186
Why didn't Guddu come too?

1562
01:27:54,685 --> 01:27:57,600
He's at home,
busy with some important work.

1563
01:27:57,680 --> 01:28:00,185
And I am free, right?

1564
01:28:00,268 --> 01:28:01,519
No, no.

1565
01:28:02,477 --> 01:28:04,477
Don't stand there like a watchman.

1566
01:28:05,852 --> 01:28:07,105
- Sit down.
- Yes.

1567
01:28:09,060 --> 01:28:12,539
I was speaking with
Rashmi over the phone.

1568
01:28:13,893 --> 01:28:15,590
She sounded very gloomy.

1569
01:28:16,273 --> 01:28:18,035
And sad.

1570
01:28:19,477 --> 01:28:20,975
I hope there are no issues.

1571
01:28:21,055 --> 01:28:22,602
No, no..

1572
01:28:23,619 --> 01:28:25,518
Did the couple have a fight?

1573
01:28:25,943 --> 01:28:26,943
No, no..

1574
01:28:28,810 --> 01:28:30,010
I don't pay you to sit around.

1575
01:28:30,602 --> 01:28:32,842
Water the plants.
They are drying up.

1576
01:28:37,313 --> 01:28:41,460
Look, sir,
I want to make one thing pretty clear.

1577
01:28:42,142 --> 01:28:46,313
My daughter is my happiness,
she's my world.

1578
01:28:46,393 --> 01:28:47,656
Yes, that's true.

1579
01:28:47,736 --> 01:28:50,390
And her happiness is your son Guddu.

1580
01:28:51,393 --> 01:28:56,040
And if Guddu doesn't
keep my daughter happy..

1581
01:28:57,026 --> 01:28:58,968
Then I will be very sad.

1582
01:29:00,477 --> 01:29:04,118
And there's no way you can survive
in Mathura after making me unhappy.

1583
01:29:04,810 --> 01:29:06,022
Understand?

1584
01:29:07,213 --> 01:29:11,060
Look.
You're a Brahmin, I'm a Brahmin.

1585
01:29:12,069 --> 01:29:15,718
You're Sudama (BRAHMIN),
and I am Parshuram (WARRIOR)!

1586
01:29:17,103 --> 01:29:24,137
So for everyone's sake, next time when
I meet Rashmi, she should look happy.

1587
01:29:25,768 --> 01:29:27,616
And not like you.

1588
01:29:28,893 --> 01:29:30,322
Understood!

1589
01:29:30,738 --> 01:29:32,939
- Shrikant.
- Yes, uncle. Coming.

1590
01:29:34,971 --> 01:29:36,530
- Yes.
- Will you have tea?

1591
01:29:39,817 --> 01:29:41,935
- Get some tea for him.
- Yes.

1592
01:29:42,018 --> 01:29:43,685
And make sure you
add some extra sugar.

1593
01:29:44,227 --> 01:29:46,478
To maintain the sweetness
in our relationship.

1594
01:29:48,102 --> 01:29:50,498
Don't leave without having tea.
You too.

1595
01:29:50,935 --> 01:29:51,935
Okay.

1596
01:29:55,612 --> 01:29:57,022
Shrikant, is a rascal.

1597
01:29:57,102 --> 01:30:01,831
They put 8 spoons of sugar in the tea.
I feel my mouth's covered in sugar.

1598
01:30:02,354 --> 01:30:06,573
This is an insult,
we are the groom's relative.

1599
01:30:14,519 --> 01:30:16,109
Look at what he's doing!

1600
01:30:35,778 --> 01:30:37,142
Look, son.

1601
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:45,273
I know that men your age have needs.

1602
01:30:46,915 --> 01:30:49,395
They get bored being served
the same thing over and over again.

1603
01:30:49,563 --> 01:30:54,554
And often..they want a change in
their palate. Of different varieties.

1604
01:30:55,959 --> 01:31:01,622
And one also feels that there's
no fun in life if there's no variety.

1605
01:31:02,852 --> 01:31:05,080
I understand and know.

1606
01:31:05,523 --> 01:31:10,769
But it's important to
keep your heart in control.

1607
01:31:11,406 --> 01:31:14,415
Who's called an ideal person?

1608
01:31:14,853 --> 01:31:18,522
Someone who controls
his capricious heart..

1609
01:31:18,602 --> 01:31:20,954
And lays the foundation
of a happy married life.

1610
01:31:21,034 --> 01:31:23,078
And he's the one who commands
respect in the society.

1611
01:31:23,102 --> 01:31:24,670
While the rest have no place.

1612
01:31:25,768 --> 01:31:27,663
Do you understand?

1613
01:31:28,970 --> 01:31:31,558
I don't understand
what you're trying to say.

1614
01:31:31,638 --> 01:31:35,053
We're the ones who don't
understand what's going on.

1615
01:31:35,771 --> 01:31:37,336
Kamla, go inside.

1616
01:31:38,503 --> 01:31:41,188
Why have you been behaving
so lustfully these days?

1617
01:31:41,268 --> 01:31:43,602
Did you get bitten by a monkey?

1618
01:31:44,602 --> 01:31:46,022
- Lusty?
- Yes.

1619
01:31:46,102 --> 01:31:47,102
Monkey?

1620
01:31:48,102 --> 01:31:51,513
I didn't get bitten by any monkey.
Nor are my desires out of control, father.

1621
01:31:51,852 --> 01:31:53,652
How do I tell you what's
going on in my heart?

1622
01:31:53,912 --> 01:31:55,518
I want to tell the truth to everyone.

1623
01:31:55,602 --> 01:31:56,911
But then Mathura will
be gripped by an earthquake..

1624
01:31:56,935 --> 01:31:59,768
You'll be in total shock, and that
Trivedi will die of a heart attack.

1625
01:31:59,852 --> 01:32:00,861
Lusty?

1626
01:32:02,977 --> 01:32:05,641
- What's he saying?
- What's going on in that mind of his?

1627
01:32:11,878 --> 01:32:14,199
You're so stupid.
This is all your fault.

1628
01:32:14,279 --> 01:32:16,793
Couldn't you have taken off that
necklace before going to the temple?

1629
01:32:16,817 --> 01:32:18,033
If I wear the vermillion,
you have a problem.

1630
01:32:18,057 --> 01:32:19,154
If I don't you still have a problem.

1631
01:32:19,178 --> 01:32:20,418
Do you think I am used to this?

1632
01:32:20,488 --> 01:32:21,992
And you gave us all the ideas.

1633
01:32:22,072 --> 01:32:24,911
You sent us to Gwalior
and also arranged the temple.

1634
01:32:24,991 --> 01:32:25,648
I see..

1635
01:32:25,728 --> 01:32:26,833
It was you who wanted
a live-in relationship..

1636
01:32:26,857 --> 01:32:27,954
And you wanted to get married.

1637
01:32:27,978 --> 01:32:29,663
I was just helping
you guys out as a friend.

1638
01:32:29,687 --> 01:32:30,520
Otherwise, why would I care?

1639
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:33,258
I see..so it's all my fault.

1640
01:32:33,338 --> 01:32:35,270
Shut up you two.
It's all my fault.

1641
01:32:35,350 --> 01:32:36,350
Happy now?

1642
01:32:37,522 --> 01:32:39,690
My own family has stopped talking to me..

1643
01:32:39,770 --> 01:32:42,634
Because they think
I am some pervert ba***

1644
01:32:42,714 --> 01:32:43,996
Who is trying to marry someone else?

1645
01:32:44,020 --> 01:32:45,187
And cheating on you.

1646
01:32:45,603 --> 01:32:48,636
And father told me how
your father threatened him..

1647
01:32:48,716 --> 01:32:50,833
Saying that his daughter
should always look happy.

1648
01:32:50,913 --> 01:32:52,982
Do I torture you every night?

1649
01:32:53,062 --> 01:32:55,348
Why can't you smile while talking
to your father over the phone?

1650
01:32:55,372 --> 01:32:57,612
I am not crazy to keep laughing
all day without a reason.

1651
01:32:57,687 --> 01:33:00,687
And your family's always turn
up wherever we go, like a mobile network.

1652
01:33:00,767 --> 01:33:03,687
If your father threatened his father,
then what is his fault?

1653
01:33:03,770 --> 01:33:04,838
Shut up.

1654
01:33:04,918 --> 01:33:07,038
It was you who said that
we shouldn't live in a hotel.

1655
01:33:07,062 --> 01:33:08,648
Hotels are for after the wedding.

1656
01:33:08,728 --> 01:33:11,272
This would've never happened
if we were living in a hotel.

1657
01:33:11,352 --> 01:33:13,398
I see..so it's all my fault.

1658
01:33:13,478 --> 01:33:15,023
Stop it you two.

1659
01:33:15,103 --> 01:33:17,204
Let's forget what happened
and think about what to do next.

1660
01:33:17,228 --> 01:33:18,437
How do we get married, Guddu?

1661
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:19,648
Always Guddu..

1662
01:33:19,728 --> 01:33:21,440
Guddu doesn't know.

1663
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:22,982
In fact, Guddu is so desperate..

1664
01:33:23,062 --> 01:33:25,371
That he can get married
right here if someone's willing..

1665
01:33:25,395 --> 01:33:26,672
To recite the wedding vows.

1666
01:37:11,495 --> 01:37:14,534
Actually, I've run out of mobile data.

1667
01:37:16,070 --> 01:37:18,107
Can I get the Wi-fi password?

1668
01:37:22,353 --> 01:37:24,123
Abbas, we don't have Wi-fi.

1669
01:37:28,026 --> 01:37:29,612
See you then.

1670
01:37:55,434 --> 01:37:57,880
By the way, I've another plan.

1671
01:37:58,524 --> 01:37:59,638
This.

1672
01:38:00,863 --> 01:38:03,672
And nothing will go wrong this time.
Swear on God.

1673
01:38:12,595 --> 01:38:14,521
I wonder what's wrong with Guddu.

1674
01:38:14,930 --> 01:38:17,986
Such a lovely child,
and the things that he's been up to..

1675
01:38:21,805 --> 01:38:22,805
Come.

1676
01:38:27,472 --> 01:38:30,557
No-no, dear. You don't have to.
Let it be.

1677
01:38:30,637 --> 01:38:31,807
Go and rest.

1678
01:38:31,887 --> 01:38:33,616
This is not your job.

1679
01:38:35,747 --> 01:38:37,519
No, mother, It's okay.

1680
01:38:39,223 --> 01:38:41,720
So dear, all okay?

1681
01:38:42,345 --> 01:38:43,345
Yes?

1682
01:38:46,804 --> 01:38:52,098
Mother, can Guddu and I
visit our family deity's temple.

1683
01:38:52,595 --> 01:38:53,807
Yes, of course. Go ahead.

1684
01:38:53,887 --> 01:38:54,887
Just..

1685
01:38:56,470 --> 01:38:58,020
Take care of him.

1686
01:38:59,345 --> 01:39:00,985
If you take proper care of him at night..

1687
01:39:01,012 --> 01:39:03,345
Then you won't have to worry about him
at other times.

1688
01:39:04,595 --> 01:39:05,974
She is right, you know.

1689
01:39:06,054 --> 01:39:06,974
Yes.

1690
01:39:07,054 --> 01:39:13,224
Men are like a money plant.

1691
01:39:13,304 --> 01:39:17,470
They need constant watering as well as
direction.

1692
01:39:17,550 --> 01:39:19,585
Otherwise, they diverge.

1693
01:39:20,865 --> 01:39:23,580
Keep him entertained.

1694
01:39:24,776 --> 01:39:27,096
In fact, give him something
to look forward to every night.

1695
01:39:27,474 --> 01:39:30,234
And he'll never look
at any other woman again.

1696
01:39:31,009 --> 01:39:34,912
Every night he'll come
home like an eager beaver.

1697
01:39:41,197 --> 01:39:42,393
Where are you going?

1698
01:39:42,970 --> 01:39:45,331
To the temple.

1699
01:39:45,641 --> 01:39:46,837
Temple?

1700
01:39:48,386 --> 01:39:49,482
Again.

1701
01:39:53,434 --> 01:39:56,728
No, We're going to Rashmi's
family deity's temple which is close-by.

1702
01:39:59,911 --> 01:40:03,087
Deity? Who is their family deity?

1703
01:40:05,595 --> 01:40:07,654
He must have a name.

1704
01:40:08,135 --> 01:40:10,054
God is known by many names.

1705
01:40:10,137 --> 01:40:11,932
But He's still God after all.

1706
01:40:12,137 --> 01:40:13,137
Shall we?

1707
01:40:13,595 --> 01:40:14,637
Father?

1708
01:40:14,898 --> 01:40:17,554
Go on, dear. By hurry back.

1709
01:40:17,634 --> 01:40:18,634
Okay.

1710
01:40:21,304 --> 01:40:23,048
And Rashmi, hold his hand.

1711
01:40:59,749 --> 01:41:02,659
<i>♪ May there be familiarity..
Living would be easy. ♪</i>

1712
01:41:02,739 --> 01:41:04,777

1713
01:41:04,857 --> 01:41:05,900
Ravan!

1714
01:41:05,980 --> 01:41:07,062
- No, Sri Ram.
- Where is Lord Hanuman?

1715
01:41:07,086 --> 01:41:08,697
- Ravan!
- Brother, they are running away.

1716
01:41:08,721 --> 01:41:10,078
- From where he came?
- How do I know?

1717
01:41:10,102 --> 01:41:11,387
They are running. Run fast.

1718
01:41:12,489 --> 01:41:16,248
<i>♪ May there be familiarity..

1719
01:41:16,462 --> 01:41:20,193

"May there be familiarity..
Living would be easy."

1723
01:41:37,786 --> 01:41:38,948
Aunty.

1724
01:41:50,733 --> 01:41:52,383
This man has deviated again.

1725
01:41:52,463 --> 01:41:55,171
They are running. Catch them.

1726
01:41:55,251 --> 01:41:57,558
They are running. Hurry up.

1727
01:41:59,542 --> 01:42:02,997
<i>♪ May there be familiarity..

1728
01:42:03,679 --> 01:42:07,262
<i>♪ May there be familiarity..

1729

1730
01:42:12,279 --> 01:42:14,377

1731
01:42:14,457 --> 01:42:15,889

1732
01:42:15,913 --> 01:42:16,929
Wait a second.

1733
01:42:17,921 --> 01:42:19,304
Why are we running?

1734
01:42:19,384 --> 01:42:20,387
What?

1735
01:42:20,467 --> 01:42:22,224
I mean they don't know anything.

1736
01:42:22,304 --> 01:42:23,584
So why are we running from them?

1737
01:42:25,220 --> 01:42:26,220
Yes.

1738
01:42:26,512 --> 01:42:27,845
Why are we running from them?

1739
01:42:28,115 --> 01:42:29,984
Wait, you rascals.

1740
01:42:31,179 --> 01:42:34,077
Brother, they are coming towards us. Run.

1741
01:42:34,157 --> 01:42:36,057
You made me run in this saree.

1742
01:42:36,137 --> 01:42:37,262
Why are we running?

1743
01:42:37,345 --> 01:42:38,738
I don't know.
I am running because you're running.

1744
01:42:38,762 --> 01:42:40,054
Shut up. Stop.

1745
01:42:44,721 --> 01:42:45,474
What?

1746
01:42:45,554 --> 01:42:46,351
What?

1747
01:42:46,554 --> 01:42:47,307
What?

1748
01:42:47,387 --> 01:42:49,599
What what?
That's what we want to know.

1749
01:42:49,679 --> 01:42:51,349
Why are you following us?

1750
01:42:51,429 --> 01:42:53,029
We're worried for your, daughter-in-law?

1751
01:42:53,095 --> 01:42:55,051
You don't know that your
husband is characterless.

1752
01:42:55,075 --> 01:42:58,357
This rascal was trying
to marry a married woman.

1753
01:42:58,437 --> 01:42:59,974
You were marrying someone else?

1754
01:43:00,054 --> 01:43:02,508
Rashmi, he's talking
about the temple incident.

1755
01:43:03,613 --> 01:43:05,307
Yes, that's fine.

1756
01:43:05,387 --> 01:43:08,183
You don't have a problem..if
your husband marries someone else.

1757
01:43:08,587 --> 01:43:10,030
Chotu, where does one find such females?

1758
01:43:10,054 --> 01:43:11,432
Stop worrying about me.

1759
01:43:11,512 --> 01:43:13,140
Why were you following us?

1760
01:43:13,220 --> 01:43:15,557
You left home giving an
excuse of your family deity.

1761
01:43:15,637 --> 01:43:16,637
So?

1762
01:43:16,762 --> 01:43:17,987
So what?

1763
01:43:18,387 --> 01:43:21,276
So..you'll know whether we're
actually going to the temple..

1764
01:43:21,356 --> 01:43:23,727
- Or not only when you follow us.
- Yes.

1765
01:43:23,807 --> 01:43:25,381
So why are you following us?

1766
01:43:25,637 --> 01:43:27,640
I wasn't following you, I was on my way.

1767
01:43:27,720 --> 01:43:28,720
To where?

1768
01:43:28,897 --> 01:43:29,897
US - What?

1769
01:43:29,929 --> 01:43:31,515
No-no. To the clinic.

1770
01:43:31,695 --> 01:43:32,595
Yes.

1771
01:43:32,679 --> 01:43:33,932
Why to the clinic?

1772
01:43:34,012 --> 01:43:35,179
- Brother is ill.
- Yes.

1773
01:43:35,262 --> 01:43:36,887
- What's wrong with him?
- Piles.

1774
01:43:36,970 --> 01:43:39,307
Yes.. Yes? Yes, I do.

1775
01:43:39,387 --> 01:43:40,806
And it's pretty bloody too.

1776
01:43:42,137 --> 01:43:44,345
Then get your piles treated.

1777
01:43:44,425 --> 01:43:45,720
Why are you following us?

1778
01:43:46,106 --> 01:43:47,640
If I catch you following us again..

1779
01:43:47,720 --> 01:43:50,369
Then I'll run a 30-minute feature
on Mathura live..

1780
01:43:50,449 --> 01:43:53,520
That Babulal has bloody piles
and it's contagious.

1781
01:43:53,804 --> 01:43:54,894
Now get lost.

1782
01:43:57,525 --> 01:43:58,925
Slippers.

1783
01:44:05,037 --> 01:44:06,957
Couldn't you say something else?

1784
01:44:07,137 --> 01:44:09,265
You should be thankful that I said piles.

1785
01:44:09,345 --> 01:44:10,890
Otherwise, I was going to say AIDS.

1786
01:44:10,970 --> 01:44:12,262
Shut up. Hurry up.

1787
01:44:12,342 --> 01:44:13,743
- Where to?
- That woman in the red sari.

1788
01:44:13,767 --> 01:44:15,349
- What red sari.
- Come on.

1789
01:44:15,429 --> 01:44:17,225
- But..
- Hurry up.

1790
01:44:20,680 --> 01:44:26,131
A reputed class of Hindu society,
means Agarwal..

1791
01:44:26,211 --> 01:44:27,003
Where were you?

1792
01:44:27,083 --> 01:44:29,434
Any longer and the couples would've
left for their honeymoon. Come on.

1793
01:44:29,458 --> 01:44:31,090
Don't ask. Did you register our names?

1794
01:44:31,170 --> 01:44:32,478
Yes, I did.
I've registered your names.

1795
01:44:32,502 --> 01:44:34,542
You just need to sign
and collect your token number.

1796
01:44:37,211 --> 01:44:39,017
They are the ones
I was telling you about.

1797
01:44:39,495 --> 01:44:40,495
What are their names?

1798
01:44:40,559 --> 01:44:42,920
Ranbir Agarwal and Damayanti Agarwal.

1799
01:44:43,003 --> 01:44:44,548
- Ranbir.
- Yes.

1800
01:44:44,628 --> 01:44:45,949
And I'm Damayanti.

1801
01:44:50,642 --> 01:44:52,190
Sign here.

1802
01:44:52,628 --> 01:44:55,197
- And their number?
- 37.

1803
01:44:56,218 --> 01:44:57,472
Take it. Sign it.

1804
01:44:58,365 --> 01:44:59,365
And listen.

1805
01:45:00,869 --> 01:45:03,796
Put on this headgear so you'll
never have to hide your face again.

1806
01:45:08,841 --> 01:45:10,480
Matches are made in Heaven.

1807
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:12,508
Yes, matches are made in Heaven.

1808
01:45:12,588 --> 01:45:15,256
And today 50 such
couples will be made.

1809
01:45:15,336 --> 01:45:19,513
And Lord Krishna himself
has preordained this.

1810
01:45:19,593 --> 01:45:22,474
So, let's begin this interesting
event with His blessings..

1811
01:45:22,554 --> 01:45:26,077
Which is filled with love,
romance, and dreams.

1812
01:45:27,085 --> 01:45:28,479
Even I also not able to recognise you.

1813
01:45:28,503 --> 01:45:30,111
Today we will done the marriage.

1814
01:45:30,191 --> 01:45:31,191
Sit.

1815
01:45:31,523 --> 01:45:33,586
Bride and groom take your seat.

1816
01:45:33,670 --> 01:45:36,159
- Radhe-Radhe. Come, sit.
- Radhe-Radhe.

1817
01:45:36,586 --> 01:45:38,758
- Who is going to perform the rituals?
- I will.

1818
01:45:39,223 --> 01:45:41,211
- And, who are you?
- I am her brother.

1819
01:45:41,295 --> 01:45:44,614
We will take the god's name
and begin the marriage.

1820
01:45:45,264 --> 01:45:46,878
Everyone, light the fire..

1821
01:45:46,958 --> 01:45:48,795
And take rice and
flowers in your hand.

1822
01:46:07,243 --> 01:46:08,973
Radhe-Radhe.

1823
01:46:19,238 --> 01:46:20,244
Live happy.

1824
01:46:20,324 --> 01:46:22,255
If you need anything tell us.

1825
01:46:22,670 --> 01:46:25,086
- Hello, sir.
- Hello, how are you?

1826
01:46:28,785 --> 01:46:31,711
Hello. Myself, Vishnu Trivedi.

1827
01:46:31,795 --> 01:46:36,345
I would like to congratulate you two for
coming together in this holy matrimony.

1828
01:46:37,200 --> 01:46:40,348
Now you two will come together
in this institution called marriage.

1829
01:46:40,929 --> 01:46:42,465
What is your name, son?

1830
01:46:46,003 --> 01:46:47,045
He's shy.

1831
01:46:47,128 --> 01:46:49,055
Son, tell uncle your name.

1832
01:46:50,981 --> 01:46:52,503
Ranbir Agarwal.

1833
01:46:52,586 --> 01:46:54,137
Ranbir Agarwal.

1834
01:47:01,991 --> 01:47:04,770
- Son, take off your headgear.
- No!

1835
01:47:05,843 --> 01:47:11,003
We can't take it off
only until after the wedding.

1836
01:47:11,086 --> 01:47:13,316
Otherwise, it's unlucky.

1837
01:47:16,334 --> 01:47:18,127
And, what's your name, dear?

1838
01:47:22,545 --> 01:47:23,923
She won't say.

1839
01:47:24,003 --> 01:47:25,003
Why?

1840
01:47:25,428 --> 01:47:26,965
Because she can't speak.

1841
01:47:27,045 --> 01:47:28,336
She is dumb.

1842
01:47:28,755 --> 01:47:31,046
- She's dumb?
- Yes, priest.

1843
01:47:31,539 --> 01:47:32,836
Great.

1844
01:47:33,770 --> 01:47:36,628
Marrying a girl that can't speak.
You really are lucky, brother.

1845
01:47:36,711 --> 01:47:37,922
Thank you.

1846
01:47:39,599 --> 01:47:43,756
Dear, did no one
come from your family?

1847
01:47:43,836 --> 01:47:45,091
No one.

1848
01:47:45,171 --> 01:47:46,332
There is someone.

1849
01:47:46,828 --> 01:47:48,170
Her brother.

1850
01:47:48,710 --> 01:47:49,861
He was here a minute ago.

1851
01:47:50,136 --> 01:47:51,429
He is gone.

1852
01:47:54,033 --> 01:47:56,327
I telling you he is gone.

1853
01:47:57,646 --> 01:48:04,015
Hey, mister. Mister, come here.

1854
01:48:04,665 --> 01:48:06,166
You. Come on.

1855
01:48:11,923 --> 01:48:13,418
You?

1856
01:48:13,878 --> 01:48:14,954
Uncle..

1857
01:48:15,795 --> 01:48:17,048
She's your sister?

1858
01:48:17,128 --> 01:48:18,545
She's my little sister.

1859
01:48:18,807 --> 01:48:20,836
- Littlle..
- But you're a Muslim.

1860
01:48:21,532 --> 01:48:24,535
Then how can you let
your sister get married here?

1861
01:48:25,476 --> 01:48:27,067
It doesn't matter.

1862
01:48:27,147 --> 01:48:28,753
He's a Muslim.

1863
01:48:28,833 --> 01:48:31,711
She's not my real sister,
just someone I call my sister.

1864
01:48:31,795 --> 01:48:34,118
You call her your sister.
But she can't speak.

1865
01:48:34,198 --> 01:48:35,381
She can't speak?

1866
01:48:35,461 --> 01:48:37,441
- Yes, Abbas, your sister can't speak.
- Yes. Yes.

1867
01:48:37,521 --> 01:48:39,878
If she can't speak,
how does she call you brother?

1868
01:48:40,707 --> 01:48:41,961
Well, she uses sign language.

1869
01:48:42,045 --> 01:48:44,461
She uses sign language.
Show me how.

1870
01:48:44,545 --> 01:48:45,567
Using signs.

1871
01:48:46,086 --> 01:48:47,366
There you go..already giving up.

1872
01:48:48,504 --> 01:48:51,329
I know this, uncle. Hindi.

1873
01:48:52,454 --> 01:48:53,596
Nerves.

1874
01:48:54,623 --> 01:48:55,961
Handcuffs.

1875
01:48:57,909 --> 01:48:59,246
Matchstick.

1876
01:49:00,309 --> 01:49:02,170
I will color your face black.

1877
01:49:04,767 --> 01:49:07,676
Rakhi. Rakhi.

1878
01:49:07,876 --> 01:49:11,715
- Mr. Trivedi, please.
- Come, Shrikant.

1879
01:49:11,795 --> 01:49:13,184
Okay, uncle.

1880
01:49:13,909 --> 01:49:15,965
I think something's fishy.

1881
01:49:16,045 --> 01:49:18,321
Fine uncle, I'll keep an eye.

1882
01:49:24,981 --> 01:49:26,753
Why are you staring at me, priest?

1883
01:49:27,111 --> 01:49:29,492
I am a Muslim,
and not from another planet.

1884
01:49:30,643 --> 01:49:32,148
Do your job.

1885
01:49:36,550 --> 01:49:38,795
- Mr. Shukla.
- Hello uncle, its Vikas.

1886
01:49:38,878 --> 01:49:40,034
Uncle's taking a bath.

1887
01:49:40,114 --> 01:49:43,961
Vikas, are Guddu and Rashmi at home?

1888
01:49:44,045 --> 01:49:46,461
No, uncle. They are visiting
your family deity's temple.

1889
01:49:46,545 --> 01:49:48,452
- They've gone for hours now.
- Family deity.

1890
01:49:50,909 --> 01:49:53,405
- But we don't have a family deity.
- What?

1891
01:49:54,045 --> 01:49:55,685
But that's where they
said they are going.

1892
01:49:56,045 --> 01:49:57,765
You know what, uncle,
I'll try calling them.

1893
01:49:57,795 --> 01:49:59,282
Their phones are switched off.

1894
01:50:02,961 --> 01:50:05,425
Vikas, listen to me carefully.

1895
01:50:06,295 --> 01:50:07,785
And answer me correctly.

1896
01:50:09,684 --> 01:50:13,173
I am attending the Agarwal
Community Mass Marriage Event.

1897
01:50:14,581 --> 01:50:19,984
And that rascal Abbas
is getting his sister married.

1898
01:50:21,154 --> 01:50:25,512
The boy she's marrying
is hiding his face.

1899
01:50:26,875 --> 01:50:29,374
But he sounds like Guddu to me.

1900
01:50:37,188 --> 01:50:39,015
Father!

1901
01:50:40,420 --> 01:50:41,782
Mother!

1902
01:50:41,862 --> 01:50:43,874
He's getting married again.

1903
01:50:44,278 --> 01:50:47,062
Someone stop that Guddu!

1904
01:51:17,756 --> 01:51:21,243
- Go to the mic and say loudly..
- Glory to Goddess?

1905
01:51:23,140 --> 01:51:24,357
Uncle!

1906
01:51:30,035 --> 01:51:31,881
- Understand.
- Yes, uncle.

1907
01:51:35,162 --> 01:51:38,068
Mr. Guddu Shukla,
please come up on stage.

1908
01:51:40,279 --> 01:51:41,552
Uncle!

1909
01:51:43,672 --> 01:51:44,961
It's him!

1910
01:51:46,600 --> 01:51:48,670
Shrikant, stop this marriage.

1911
01:51:48,753 --> 01:51:50,628
- Stop all this.
- Stop this charade.

1912
01:51:50,711 --> 01:51:55,673
Guddu Shukla don't you dare move.

1913
01:51:55,753 --> 01:51:57,756
Dumb girl also don't move.

1914
01:51:57,836 --> 01:51:59,398
Why did you turn around?

1915
01:51:59,691 --> 01:52:01,794
Let's go, Guddu, he's coming this way.

1916
01:52:01,874 --> 01:52:04,128
You don't know my father.
He will bury you alive.

1917
01:52:04,211 --> 01:52:05,581
Let's go.

1918
01:52:31,307 --> 01:52:32,336
I knew it.

1919
01:52:32,420 --> 01:52:36,360
Son-in-law, weren't you
ashamed of doing such a thing?

1920
01:52:36,753 --> 01:52:38,292
- Where is Rashmi?
- Tell me.

1921
01:52:39,045 --> 01:52:44,086
How dare you marry that Muslim's sister
when my daughter's still around.

1922
01:52:44,170 --> 01:52:47,840
My name is Vishnu Trivedi.

1923
01:52:47,920 --> 01:52:49,983
I will bury you alive.

1924
01:52:50,063 --> 01:52:52,229
- This man's lost his mind.
- Tell me. Where is my daughter?

1925
01:52:52,253 --> 01:52:55,753
This man's lost his mind.
He's completely lost his mind.

1926
01:52:55,833 --> 01:52:57,915
This is such a cheap thing to do.

1927
01:52:57,995 --> 01:53:02,003
Sister, maybe you don't
know that he's already married.

1928
01:53:02,973 --> 01:53:05,491
You knew everything,
so why didn't you tell her?

1929
01:53:05,571 --> 01:53:08,586
What kind of a brother are you?
I will beat you.

1930
01:53:09,305 --> 01:53:11,071
Why don't you tell us where is Rashmi?

1931
01:53:12,012 --> 01:53:12,920
Tell me.

1932
01:53:13,003 --> 01:53:14,420
Uncle, he won't speak up like this.

1933
01:53:14,500 --> 01:53:18,419
Speak up fast otherwise
I'll hit you. Got it?

1934
01:53:25,469 --> 01:53:26,731
What's going on here?

1935
01:53:27,336 --> 01:53:29,622
Whom are you marrying now?

1936
01:53:29,702 --> 01:53:31,628
With Abbas's sister.

1937
01:53:33,952 --> 01:53:36,171
And he knows where's my daughter.

1938
01:53:36,251 --> 01:53:39,756
- But he isn't telling us.
- Where is Rashmi? Tell me.

1939
01:53:39,836 --> 01:53:42,423
And Abbas, how can she be your sister?

1940
01:53:42,503 --> 01:53:44,628
Your sister already got married.
Speak up.

1941
01:53:44,708 --> 01:53:46,922
She's like my sister.

1942
01:53:47,002 --> 01:53:49,128
Who can't speak?

1943
01:53:49,208 --> 01:53:52,850
What are you doing, son?
Did someone drug you again?

1944
01:53:52,930 --> 01:53:54,976
How many times will you get married?

1945
01:53:55,056 --> 01:53:58,104
You got married more times in a month
than anyone else did in our entire family.

1946
01:53:58,128 --> 01:53:59,764
You're an embarrassment to our family.

1947
01:53:59,844 --> 01:54:02,198
He's a bas***

1948
01:54:02,278 --> 01:54:03,903
Stop it all of you.

1949
01:54:06,537 --> 01:54:07,628
I've had enough.

1950
01:54:07,711 --> 01:54:11,417
And if anyone says anything more to Guddu..
She can speak.

1951
01:54:11,497 --> 01:54:12,723
I am not dumb.

1952
01:54:23,795 --> 01:54:25,268
Rashmi?

1953
01:54:25,887 --> 01:54:29,961
Meaning you're marrying your wife again?
Wife?

1954
01:54:30,215 --> 01:54:33,525
I am not his wife yet.
You'll are not letting me be.

1955
01:54:35,461 --> 01:54:37,443
What on earth is going on, son?

1956
01:54:37,795 --> 01:54:39,292
I don't understand.

1957
01:54:39,372 --> 01:54:42,228
It's I who don't understand,
father, what's going on.

1958
01:54:42,308 --> 01:54:44,673
We've been running
around just to get married.

1959
01:54:44,753 --> 01:54:46,381
But all efforts are in vain.

1960
01:54:46,461 --> 01:54:49,132
Plus I am getting beaten up, thrashed.

1961
01:54:49,212 --> 01:54:52,099
I am being called rascal,
pervert, and a Casanova.

1962
01:54:52,179 --> 01:54:53,961
Why?
Because we wanted to get married.

1963
01:54:54,045 --> 01:54:55,126
Because we fell in love.

1964
01:54:57,905 --> 01:54:58,905
That..

1965
01:55:00,251 --> 01:55:02,936
I wanted a live-in relationship
before getting married.

1966
01:55:12,184 --> 01:55:13,586
Live-in relationship.

1967
01:55:14,331 --> 01:55:15,897
You two were in a live-in.

1968
01:55:18,542 --> 01:55:19,771
Live-in?

1969
01:55:20,773 --> 01:55:22,336
Yes, live-in.

1970
01:55:22,781 --> 01:55:25,420
Just like Nazeem Khan. In a live-in.

1971
01:55:25,500 --> 01:55:28,826
And many more young couples
around the country live. Live-in.

1972
01:55:33,482 --> 01:55:35,448
Meaning you're not married.

1973
01:55:36,755 --> 01:55:38,294
You're still a bachelor.

1974
01:55:38,374 --> 01:55:39,878
He's found a new lease of life.

1975
01:55:39,961 --> 01:55:41,795
Let's hear them out first.

1976
01:55:41,878 --> 01:55:43,513
Stop it all of you.

1977
01:55:45,888 --> 01:55:47,006
Father..

1978
01:55:47,747 --> 01:55:49,380
What's done is done.

1979
01:55:49,773 --> 01:55:52,335
We were going to seek
your permission to get married.

1980
01:55:53,199 --> 01:55:55,280
Please forget all of it.

1981
01:55:55,360 --> 01:55:57,295
How can we forget it?

1982
01:55:57,607 --> 01:56:00,795
What you did is a sin in our religion?

1983
01:56:00,875 --> 01:56:02,319
This is not religion.

1984
01:56:02,399 --> 01:56:03,586
Then, what is it?

1985
01:56:03,670 --> 01:56:04,990
- It's a topic.
- It's a topic.

1986
01:56:07,945 --> 01:56:09,419
For the elections.

1987
01:56:09,986 --> 01:56:13,929
And, Mr. Trivedi,
this is not what the youth want.

1988
01:56:14,448 --> 01:56:17,956
And we have the highest
number of youths in the world.

1989
01:56:18,454 --> 01:56:20,294
More than 700 million.

1990
01:56:20,758 --> 01:56:24,232
Imagine 700 million votes.

1991
01:56:24,312 --> 01:56:26,336
You never thought about it this way..

1992
01:56:26,709 --> 01:56:28,351
Which is why you lost
the previous elections.

1993
01:56:28,375 --> 01:56:29,725
With 2300 votes.

1994
01:56:29,805 --> 01:56:31,086
To that new guy.

1995
01:56:31,166 --> 01:56:32,920
Do you understand what's youth icon?

1996
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,170
You lost because the youth was with him.

1997
01:56:35,446 --> 01:56:38,255
The youth who want to live
on their own terms, father.

1998
01:56:39,002 --> 01:56:41,106
The youth these days
know that religion and caste..

1999
01:56:41,186 --> 01:56:43,420
Are just a topic for the elections.

2000
01:56:43,500 --> 01:56:46,003
And your political party,
the Culture Destruction Party..

2001
01:56:46,086 --> 01:56:47,609
- That's Protection.
- Shut up.

2002
01:56:47,908 --> 01:56:49,298
What protection?

2003
01:56:49,378 --> 01:56:52,592
You call Colouring youth's
face black protection.

2004
01:56:52,672 --> 01:56:54,591
Can you even spell Culture?

2005
01:56:55,297 --> 01:56:57,621
The youth these days want employment.

2006
01:56:57,701 --> 01:56:58,797
Homes.

2007
01:56:58,877 --> 01:56:59,646
Wide roads.

2008
01:56:59,726 --> 01:57:01,086
And free Wi-fi.

2009
01:57:01,170 --> 01:57:02,825
Yes, very important.

2010
01:57:12,114 --> 01:57:13,295
That's fine.

2011
01:57:13,683 --> 01:57:18,111
But uncle,
do we colour their faces black or not.

2012
01:57:24,046 --> 01:57:25,586
Color her face black.

2013
01:57:26,664 --> 01:57:28,086
She's my daughter.

2014
01:57:28,474 --> 01:57:29,753
My daughter.

2015
01:57:30,687 --> 01:57:34,938
If she even sneezes,
I make entire Braj quiver.

2016
01:57:38,719 --> 01:57:40,225
And you..

2017
01:57:43,700 --> 01:57:46,424
Does anyone else know that you two..

2018
01:57:47,969 --> 01:57:49,706
Were in a live-in relationship?

2019
01:57:49,786 --> 01:57:51,295
- No.
- Not at all.

2020
01:57:53,503 --> 01:57:55,170
- Shrikant.
- Yes, uncle.

2021
01:57:56,199 --> 01:58:00,407
Take all the posters
we put up against Nazeem Khan.

2022
01:58:00,678 --> 01:58:02,560
And no more coloring face anyone black.

2023
01:58:02,640 --> 01:58:03,920
- But uncle..
- Understand?

2024
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:04,907
Go.

2025
01:58:04,987 --> 01:58:05,987
And listen.

2026
01:58:06,258 --> 01:58:08,545
Please go on stage
and restart the mantras.

2027
01:58:08,625 --> 01:58:10,711
Guddu Shukla isn't finished yet.

2028
01:58:15,170 --> 01:58:16,548
Sir, begin.

2029
01:58:17,093 --> 01:58:18,777
Yes. Everything is happen good.

2030
01:58:21,836 --> 01:58:24,545
<i>♪ You are Laung and I am Laachi. ♪</i>

2031
01:58:24,628 --> 01:58:27,311

<i>♪ Your image dwells in my dreamy eyes. ♪</i>

2040
01:59:20,387 --> 01:59:24,545
Whoever eats may also repent.

2041
01:59:24,625 --> 01:59:26,045
Clap. Clap.

2042
01:59:26,128 --> 01:59:27,545
Now they are our relatives.

2043
01:59:27,628 --> 01:59:29,607
- Congratulation.
- What's going on?

2044
01:59:29,687 --> 01:59:31,670
Guddu's getting married.

2045
01:59:31,750 --> 01:59:33,354
The same boy's getting
married over and over again.

2046
01:59:33,378 --> 01:59:34,896
Even when two bachelors
still in the house.

2047
01:59:34,920 --> 01:59:37,113
Well, Pappu's date has expired.
But think about me.

2048
01:59:37,193 --> 01:59:38,128
Hey get lost.

2049
01:59:38,208 --> 01:59:41,045
Sir..I am a big fan.
Can I take a selfie?

2050
01:59:41,125 --> 01:59:42,003
Come here.

2051
01:59:42,083 --> 01:59:43,896
Is one of the grooms missing,
Can I take his place?

2052
01:59:43,920 --> 01:59:45,800
- Talk to Mr. Shukla.
- He is my brother-in-law.

2053
01:59:45,833 --> 01:59:47,071
Who is he?

2054
01:59:48,223 --> 01:59:54,667
Son-in-law, tell me how do I attract
this young generation towards me?

2055
02:00:02,303 --> 02:00:04,006
Don't ask a wise man's caste..

2056
02:00:04,086 --> 02:00:05,478
"Ask about his intelligence."

2057
02:00:05,758 --> 02:00:07,258
Value the sword..

2058
02:00:07,338 --> 02:00:08,887
And not the scabbard.

2059
02:00:08,970 --> 02:00:10,353
I am Guddu Shukla.

2060
02:00:10,433 --> 02:00:12,005
And I am Rashmi Shukla.

2061
02:00:12,085 --> 02:00:15,561
And I think the sun rose
from the west in Mathura today.

2062
02:00:15,641 --> 02:00:17,416
Because what you're going to see next..

2063
02:00:17,496 --> 02:00:19,515
Is beyond your imagination.

2064
02:00:19,595 --> 02:00:22,225
The Culture Protection
party's MP candidate..

2065
02:00:22,305 --> 02:00:25,657
Mr. Vishnu Trivedi's election
rally is in progression.

2066
02:00:25,737 --> 02:00:29,008
And imagine who is promoting him?

2067
02:00:29,088 --> 02:00:30,178
