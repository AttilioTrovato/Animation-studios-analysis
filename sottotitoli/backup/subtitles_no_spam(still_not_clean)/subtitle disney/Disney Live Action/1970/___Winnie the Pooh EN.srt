1
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:34,054
This could be the room
of any small boy...

2
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:38,894
but it just happens to belong
to a boy named Christopher Robin.

3
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:44,062
Like most small boys, Christopher Robin
has toy animals to play with.

4
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:49,632
They all live together
in a wonderful world of make-believe.

5
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:53,907
But his best friend is a bear
called Winnie the Pooh...

6
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,141
or "Pooh" for short.

7
00:01:56,216 --> 00:02:00,016
Now, Pooh had some
very unusual adventures...

8
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:04,216
and they all happened right here
in the Hundred-Acre Wood.

9
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:09,159
<i>Deep in the Hundred-Acre Wood</i>

10
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:14,326
<i>Where Christopher Robin plays</i>

11
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,270
<i>You'll find</i>
<i>the enchanted neighborhood</i>

12
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:26,336
<i>Of Christopher's</i>
<i>childhood days</i>

13
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:31,372
<i>A donkey named Eeyore</i>
<i>is his friend</i>

14
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:35,888
<i>And Kanga and little Roo</i>

15
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:39,049
<i>There's Rabbit and Piglet</i>

16
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,252
<i>And there's Owl</i>

17
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:45,787
<i>But most of all</i>
<i>Winnie the Pooh</i>

18
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:49,562
<i>Winnie the Pooh</i>
<i>Winnie the Pooh</i>

19
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:52,799
<i>Tubby little cubby</i>
<i>all stuffed with fluff</i>

20
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:56,774
<i>He's Winnie the Pooh</i>
<i>Winnie the Pooh</i>

21
00:02:56,843 --> 00:03:00,279
<i>Willy-nilly, silly old bear</i>

22
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:01,813
- <i>Winnie the Pooh</i>
- Pooh!

23
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:03,075
- <i>Winnie the Pooh</i>
- Pooh!

24
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:06,084
<i>Tubby little cubby</i>
<i>all stuffed with fluff</i>

25
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:09,610
<i>He's Winnie the Pooh</i>
<i>Winnie the Pooh</i>

26
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:14,786
<i>Willy-nilly, silly old bear</i>

27
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:19,558
Winnie the Pooh lived
in this enchanted forest...

28
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:21,463
under the name of"Sanders"...

29
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:26,130
which means he had the name
over the door in gold letters...

30
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,834
and he lived under it.

31
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:32,071
- Now, when Pooh heard
his "pooh-coo" clock...
- Pooh-coo.

32
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:37,173
Pooh-coo, pooh-coo, pooh-coo,
pooh-coo, pooh-coo.

33
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,810
He knew it was time
for something.

34
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,946
But he was a bear
of very little brain.

35
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:48,255
So when he thought, he thought in
the most thoughtful way he could think.

36
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:51,923
I haven't thought of anything,
have you?

37
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:54,865
Nor neither have I.

38
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:57,630
Think, think, think.

39
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:04,173
Oh, yes. Time for
my stoutness exercise.

40
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,940
Up, down, up.

41
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:10,005
<i>When I up, down</i>
<i>touch the ground</i>

42
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:13,280
<i>It puts me in the mood</i>

43
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:15,548
<i>Up, down, touch the ground</i>

44
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:19,456
<i>In the mood for food</i>

45
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:23,461
<i>I am stout, round</i>
<i>and I have found</i>

46
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:26,054
<i>Speaking poundage-wise</i>

47
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:31,399
<i>I improve my appetite</i>
<i>when I exercise</i>

48
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:33,632
Oh, stuff and fluff.

49
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:40,137
That's better. Thank you.

50
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:42,204
Now, where was I?

51
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:51,223
Oh, yes. I'm rumbly in my tumbly.
Time for something sweet.

52
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,988
<i>I am short, fat</i>
<i>and proud of that</i>

53
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:57,393
<i>So with all my might</i>

54
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,761
<i>I up, down, up, down</i>

55
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:02,357
<i>To my appetite's delight</i>

56
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:05,700
<i>While I up, down</i>
<i>touch the ground</i>

57
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:08,332
<i>I think of things to chew</i>

58
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:11,104
Like honey and milk
and chocolate.

59
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:13,509
<i>With a hefty, happy appetite</i>

60
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:15,740
<i>I'm a hefty, happy pooh</i>

61
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:19,945
<i>With a hefty, happy appetite</i>
<i>he's a hefty, happy pooh</i>

62
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:25,448
Oh, bother. Empty again.

63
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:28,460
Only the sticky part is left.

64
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:40,805
That buzzing noise
means something.

65
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:45,640
And the only reason for making
a buzzing noise that I know of...

66
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:49,478
is because you're a... a bee!

67
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:59,583
And the only reason for being a bee
is to make honey.

68
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:04,894
And the only reason for making honey
is so I can eat it.

69
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:11,499
And so Winnie the Pooh
climbed the honey tree.

70
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:14,563
He climbed and he climbed
and he climbed.

71
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,837
- And as he climbed,
he hummed a little hum.
- <i>Hum, hum</i>

72
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:18,934
<i>Hum, hum</i>

73
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:21,479
And I call it
my "rumbly in my tumbly" song.

74
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:24,482
Yes, and it went
something like this.

75
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,678
<i>Hum dum de dum</i>
<i>Hum dum de dum</i>

76
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:30,746
<i>I am so rumbly</i>
<i>in my tumbly</i>

77
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:32,484
Oh!

78
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:35,686
<i>Time to munch</i>
<i>an early luncheon</i>

79
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:38,492
<i>Hum de dum dum dum</i>

80
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:41,658
<i>Oh, I wouldn't climb this tree</i>

81
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:44,328
<i>If a pooh flew like a bee</i>

82
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,669
<i>But I wouldn't be a bear then</i>

83
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,675
<i>So I guess</i>
<i>I wouldn't care then</i>

84
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:54,509
<i>Bears love honey</i>
<i>and I'm a Pooh bear</i>

85
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,447
<i>So I do care</i>
<i>So I climb there</i>

86
00:06:57,517 --> 00:07:00,680
<i>I'm so rumbly in my tumbly</i>

87
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,618
<i>Time for something</i>

88
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:07,853
For something sweet to eat!

89
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:12,864
If only I hadn't...
You see, what I meant to do...

90
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:16,800
And it all comes, I suppose,
from liking honey so much.

91
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:22,340
Oh, bother.

92
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:26,208
Winnie the Pooh
crawled out of the gorse bush...

93
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:30,238
brushed the prickles from his nose
and began to think again.

94
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:33,376
- Think, think, think.
- And the first person
he thought of was...

95
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,581
- Winnie the Pooh?
- No. Christopher Robin.

96
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:38,624
Oh.

97
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:42,319
Christopher Robin lived
in another part of the forest...

98
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:46,729
where he could be near his friends
and help them with their problems.

99
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:50,360
On this summer day,
gloomy old Eeyore...

100
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:54,896
being stuffed with sawdust,
had lost his tail again.

101
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:58,740
- Eeyore, this won't hurt.
- Never does.

102
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:06,081
There now. Did I get your tail
back on properly, Eeyore?

103
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:10,350
No matter. Most likely
lose it again anyway.

104
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:14,121
It is my considered opinion...

105
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:18,562
that Eeyore's tail should be
placed a trifle to the, uh, right.

106
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:23,364
And now, if you were to ask me,
I think it's just a wee bit...

107
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:25,028
South.

108
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:28,562
No, no. North, dear.

109
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:33,635
Cheer up, Eeyore. Don't be so gloomy.
Try swishing it.

110
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:42,412
- It worked. It worked.
- Oh, goody! Hooray!

111
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:48,757
Thanks. It's not much of a tail,
but I'm sort of attached to it.

112
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:53,731
- Good morning, Christopher Robin.
- Oh, good morning, Winnie the Pooh.

113
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:56,233
- Good morning, Pooh bear.
- Good morning, Pooh bear.

114
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:58,827
If it is a good morning,
which I doubt.

115
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:08,075
- What are you looking for, Pooh bear?
- I just said to myself, coming along
thinking and wondering...

116
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:10,775
if you had such a thing as, uh...

117
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:15,116
such a thing, Christopher,
uh, as a balloon, about you.

118
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,617
What do you want a balloon for?

119
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:26,689
- Honey.
- But you don't get honey
with a balloon.

120
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:29,758
- I do.
- How?

121
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:34,272
I shall fly like a bee,
up to the honey tree. See?

122
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:38,504
But just a minute.
You can't fool the bees that way.

123
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,637
You'll see.

124
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:46,345
Now, would you be so kind as to tow me
to a muddy place of which I know of.

125
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:51,356
So Christopher Robin towed Winnie
the Pooh to the very muddy place.

126
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:58,662
And Pooh rolled and rolled
until he was black all over.

127
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,632
There, now.

128
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:10,699
- Isn't this a clever disguise?
- What are you supposed to be?

129
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:15,711
I'm a little, black
rain cloud, of course.

130
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,647
Silly old bear.

131
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:22,313
Now, would you aim me
at the bees, please?

132
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:28,349
- Careful, Pooh. Hold on tight.
- Yes.

133
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:30,827
- Four...
- Yes.
- Three...
- Yes.

134
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:33,592
- Two...
- Yes.
- One!

135
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:38,262
<i>I'm just a little, black rain cloud</i>

136
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:42,000
<i>Hovering under the honey tree</i>

137
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:46,374
<i>I'm only a little, black rain cloud</i>

138
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:49,608
<i>Pay no attention to little me</i>

139
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:54,346
<i>Oh, everyone knows</i>
<i>that a rain cloud</i>

140
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,287
<i>Never eats honey</i>
<i>no, not a nip</i>

141
00:10:57,356 --> 00:11:02,521
<i>I'm just floating around</i>
<i>over the ground</i>

142
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:05,564
<i>Wondering where I will drip</i>

143
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:13,532
Christopher Robin,
I think the bees...

144
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:17,303
S-U-S-P-E-C-T something.

145
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:19,867
Perhaps they think
you're after their honey.

146
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:23,642
Well, it may be that.
You never can tell with bees.

147
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:28,619
<i>Oh, I'm just</i>
<i>a little, black rain cloud</i>

148
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:33,625
<i>Hovering under the honey tree</i>

149
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:10,527
Christopher Robin!

150
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:13,690
I think it would help
with this deception...

151
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:17,258
if you would just kind of open
your umbrella and say...

152
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:21,796
- "Tut, tut, it looks like rain."
- Tut, tut, it looks like rain.

153
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:25,002
Tut, tut, it looks like rain.

154
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:40,954
Christopher Robin, I have come
to a very important decision.

155
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:45,019
These are the wrong sorts of bees.

156
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:04,678
Excuse me, please, bees.

157
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:12,015
Christopher Robin!

158
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:16,188
Oh, bother!

159
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:18,355
I think I shall come down.

160
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:21,422
L'll catch you, Pooh.

161
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:29,039
Hurry, come on. The bees!

162
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:33,207
Help, Christopher!

163
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:43,913
Christopher Robin,
you never can tell with bees.

164
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,124
Now, Pooh was not the sort
to give up easily.

165
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:55,224
When he put his mind to honey,
he stuck to it.

166
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:58,236
Now, honey rhymes with bunny...

167
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:00,465
and bunny rhymes with, uh...

168
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:03,099
Rabbit?

169
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:07,202
Yeah, I like Rabbit
because he uses short, easy words...

170
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:11,875
like, "How about lunch"
and "Help yourself, Pooh."

171
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:14,886
Pooh? Lunch?
Oh, no. Not again.

172
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:17,650
Oh, my. Oh, my.
Oh, my goodness gracious!

173
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:20,886
Is anybody at home?

174
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,919
What I said was,
"Is anybody at home?"

175
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:27,795
- No.
- Bother.

176
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:31,633
- Isn't there anybody here at all?
- Nobody.

177
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:37,438
Must be somebody there because
somebody must have said, "Nobody."

178
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:39,841
- Rabbit, isn't that you?
- No!

179
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:41,937
Well, isn't that the Rabbit's voice?

180
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:46,178
I don't think so.
It isn't meant to be.

181
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:48,277
- Hello, Rabbit.
- Oh.

182
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:51,517
Oh, hello, Pooh bear.
Pooh bear!

183
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:56,425
Uh, uh...
What a pleasant surprise.

184
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:58,656
Uh, how about lunch?

185
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,961
Oh, thank you, Rabbit.

186
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:03,194
And help yourself, Pooh.

187
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:11,665
Uh, would you like condensed milk
or honey on your bread?

188
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:17,046
Both. But never mind the bread, please.
Just a small helping, if you please.

189
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:19,846
Huh, there you are.

190
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:26,183
Is, uh, something wrong?

191
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:29,625
Well, I did mean
a little larger "small helping."

192
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:32,789
Perhaps it would save time
if you took the whole jar.

193
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:34,856
Thank you, Rabbit.

194
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:41,001
So Pooh ate and ate
and ate and ate...

195
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:43,837
and ate and ate
and ate and ate...

196
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:45,900
and ate.

197
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:48,208
Until at last he said to Rabbit...

198
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,874
in a rather sticky voice:

199
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,009
I must be going now.

200
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:55,349
Good-bye, Rabbit.

201
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:59,221
Well, good-bye, if you're sure
you won't have any more.

202
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:03,387
- Is there any more?
- No, there isn't.

203
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,487
I thought not.

204
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:14,530
Oh, oh, help and bother!
I'm stuck.

205
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:18,167
Oh, dear. Oh, gracious. Oh.

206
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:20,768
Well, it all comes
from eating too much.

207
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:26,573
It all comes from not having
front doors big enough!

208
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:30,778
Oh, dear, it's no use.

209
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:34,292
There's only one thing to do.
L'll get Christopher Robin.

210
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,558
Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
Oh, my. Heavens to Betsy.

211
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:52,403
- Well, if it isn't Pooh bear.
- Oh, hello, Owl.

212
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:56,107
Splendid day to be up and about
one's business, quite, eh?

213
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:00,108
Oh.

214
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,656
I say, are you stuck?

215
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:07,817
No, no, just resting...

216
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:11,989
and thinking
and humming to myself.

217
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,592
You, sir, are stuck...

218
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:17,828
a wedged bear,
in a great tightness.

219
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:20,497
In a word, irremovable.

220
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:24,599
Now obviously, this situation
calls for an expert.

221
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:29,803
Somebody call
for an excavation expert?

222
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,442
I'm not in the book,
but I'm at your service.

223
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:34,645
Gopher's the name.
Here's my card.

224
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,315
- What's your problem?
- Yes, yes, yes, yes.

225
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:42,349
It seems the entrance
to Rabbit's domicile is impassable.

226
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:44,988
Uh, to be exact, plugged.

227
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,123
And you want me to dig it out?

228
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:49,497
Precisely.

229
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:53,368
Uh, I say, it's over here,
my good fellow.

230
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:59,934
Oh, the first thing to be done
is get rid of that bear.

231
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:02,344
He's gummin' up the whole project.

232
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:05,008
Dash it all, he is the project!

233
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,985
Um, hard digging.
Might hit bedrock.

234
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:11,545
Danger of cave-in. Risky.

235
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:16,356
Need planks for bracing.
Big job. Take two, three days.

236
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:19,488
Three days?
What about lunches?

237
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:23,365
No problem, I always go home for lunch.
Oh, oh! This will run into money.

238
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:26,529
I, uh... I say, how much?

239
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:31,065
Do the job for hourly rate
plus cover materials, plus overtime...

240
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:33,373
plus ten percent.

241
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:36,881
- And your estimate?
- Nope, can't give an estimate.

242
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:40,043
- Too risky.
- Blast it all.

243
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:44,419
- Good idea! We'll dynamite. Save time.
- Eh, what's the charge?

244
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:47,254
The charge? Oh, about
seven sticks of dynamite.

245
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:50,056
Oh, no, no, no, the cost!
The charge in money?

246
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:53,189
Nope, no charge account.
I work strictly cash.

247
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:55,529
Obviously, but, I should think...

248
00:18:55,601 --> 00:19:01,062
Well, I can't stand around lollygagging
all day. I got a tight schedule.

249
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:05,099
If you think it over,
let me know. You got my card.
I'm not in the book, you know.

250
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:08,704
Oh. Dash it all, he's gone.

251
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:12,113
After all,
he's not in the book, you know.

252
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:14,243
- Oh.
- Here we come. Don't worry.

253
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,720
Cheer up, Pooh bear.
We're coming.

254
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:22,123
- We'll get you out.
- Well, maybe.

255
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:26,187
Silly old bear.
Here, give me your paw.

256
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:33,235
Ow. It's no use. I'm stuck.

257
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:37,469
Well, if we can't pull you out, Pooh,
perhaps we can push you back.

258
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:40,307
Oh, no! Not that!
Oh, my gracious!

259
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:42,904
Oh, dear!

260
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:48,044
Having got this far,
it seems a pity to waste it.

261
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,317
Pooh bear, there's only
one thing we can do:

262
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:56,418
- Wait for you to get thin again.
- Oh, bother. How long will that take?

263
00:19:56,495 --> 00:20:00,659
Days. Weeks. Months.
Who knows?

264
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:03,292
Oh, dear.

265
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:06,269
If I have to face that...

266
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:08,465
that thing for months...

267
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,600
well, I might as well
make the best of it.

268
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:15,813
Oh, no!
There it is again!

269
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:19,578
Well, l'll just turn it to the wall.

270
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:21,642
Oh, dear!

271
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,584
Yes, a frame. Uh-huh.

272
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:32,185
Oh. No, no, no. No.

273
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:35,957
Very nice.

274
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:41,036
And a splash of color.

275
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:45,304
Oh, it just doesn't have
that rustic, informal look.

276
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:50,773
There, a hunting trophy.

277
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:53,841
Aha! I know just the thing.

278
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,013
Something tickles.

279
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:03,020
Oh, Pooh!
You messed up my moose!

280
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:08,195
Pooh, Roo has a little surprise for you.

281
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:12,328
- Flowers.
- Honeysuckle.

282
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:17,398
No, Pooh, you don't eat them.
You smell them.

283
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:19,876
Oh.

284
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:24,348
That's not bad. Not bad at all.
It's rather good, I think.

285
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:27,476
- Ah...
- Oh, no! Hold it!

286
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,550
Oh, no! No, help!

287
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:36,919
Why did I ever invite
that bear to lunch?

288
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:40,089
Why, oh, why, oh, why?

289
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:44,329
While Pooh's bottom was stuck
at the top of page 28...

290
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:47,998
his top was stuck
at the bottom of page 30.

291
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:51,167
So both ends waited
to get thin again...

292
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:53,234
day after day...

293
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:56,839
night after lonely night.

294
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:02,850
I wonder what's for breakfast.

295
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:07,619
Breakfast.

296
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,855
Lunch.

297
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:16,765
Huh? A lunch box!

298
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:19,395
It certainly is!

299
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:24,238
I'm working the swing shift, you know.
Time for my midnight snack.

300
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:27,472
Say, ain't you that stuck-up bear?

301
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:31,141
Hmm. I still think I could
blast you out of there.

302
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:36,813
Uh, what sort of lunch
is in that lunch box?

303
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:40,949
Well, let's see here.
Ah, um, oh!

304
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,256
Summer squash...

305
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:50,167
salmon salad, succotash,
spiced custard...

306
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:52,260
and honey.

307
00:22:52,337 --> 00:22:56,171
- Honey?
- Honey? Oh, no!

308
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:01,672
Could you spare
a small smackerel?

309
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:05,979
Say, you ought to do something
about that speech impediment, sonny.

310
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,645
- Oh, thank you, Gopher.
- Oh, no! Not that!

311
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,985
No, no, no, no, no!
Not one drop!

312
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:15,117
But, Rabbit,
I wasn't going to eat it.

313
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:17,627
I was just going to taste it.

314
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:19,960
L'll taste it for you.

315
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:25,333
That supercilious scoundrel
confiscated my honey.

316
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:28,498
Don't feed the bear.

317
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:32,301
I'm going to skedaddle.

318
00:23:32,377 --> 00:23:35,107
I'm not in the book.

319
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,205
And I'm "ding danged" glad of it!

320
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:42,816
And then one morning
when Rabbit was beginning to think...

321
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:46,847
that he might never be able to use
his front door again, it happened.

322
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:49,621
He budged. Hooray!
"Christopher Crobbin."

323
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:53,994
No, "Chrostofer Rubin."
He "bidged!" He "badged!" He "booged!"

324
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:57,899
- Today is the day!
- <i>Hooray for you</i>

325
00:23:57,969 --> 00:24:00,130
<i>Hooray for me</i>

326
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:04,835
<i>Hooray, hooray</i>
<i>The pooh will soon be free</i>

327
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:08,539
<i>Dum ba dum</i>
<i>ba dum ba dum ba dum</i>

328
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,979
<i>Now the time has</i>
<i>come for proving</i>

329
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:13,142
<i>What the diet did for Pooh</i>

330
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:15,345
<i>And since we pledged</i>
<i>he'd be unwedged</i>

331
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,411
<i>That's what we're going to do</i>

332
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:19,753
<i>He'll be pulled</i>
<i>and he'll be tugged</i>

333
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:21,850
<i>And eventually unplugged</i>

334
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:24,157
<i>We'll have a tug-of-war</i>

335
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:27,198
<i>To open Rabbit's door</i>

336
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:32,032
<i>Think "heave-age,"think "ho-age"</i>

337
00:24:32,103 --> 00:24:36,733
<i>And out the pooh will "go-age"</i>

338
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:41,370
<i>For mind over matter</i>

339
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:45,712
<i>Has made the pooh "un-fatter"</i>

340
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:51,119
<i>Heave-ho</i>

341
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:53,123
<i>Heave-ho</i>

342
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:58,561
<i>Heave, heave, heave, heave, heave</i>

343
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:02,796
- There he goes!
- Suffering sassafras.

344
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:08,033
He's sailing clean out of the book!
Quick! Turn the page!

345
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:16,270
Stuck again.

346
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,873
Don't worry, Pooh.
We'll get you out.

347
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:22,249
No hurry. Take your time.

348
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,413
Yum-yum.

349
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:28,318
<i>Bears love honey</i>
<i>and I'm a pooh bear</i>

350
00:25:28,393 --> 00:25:32,329
<i>Yum, yum, yum, yum</i>
<i>Slurp, slurp, slurp, slurp</i>

351
00:25:32,397 --> 00:25:36,595
<i>Yum, yum, yum, yum</i>
<i>Time for something sweet</i>

352
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:39,262
And so we come
to the next chapter in which...

353
00:25:39,337 --> 00:25:41,737
But I haven't finished yet.

354
00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:44,104
But, Pooh, you're in the next chapter.

355
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:47,076
Oh. What happens to me?

356
00:25:47,145 --> 00:25:50,512
Well, let's turn the page
and find out.

357
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:53,846
Now, one fine day, the east wind...

358
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,353
traded places with the west wind.

359
00:25:56,421 --> 00:26:00,983
And that stirred things up a bit
all through the Hundred-Acre Wood.

360
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:07,655
Now, on this blustery day...

361
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:11,168
Pooh decided to visit
his thoughtful spot.

362
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:14,171
Yes, and on the way
I made up a little hum.

363
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:17,436
And it hums something like this.

364
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:21,605
<i>Hum dum, dum ditty dum</i>
<i>Hum dum, dum</i>

365
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:26,208
<i>Oh, the wind is lashing lustily</i>
<i>and the trees are thrashing thrustily</i>

366
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:28,548
<i>And the leaves are rustling gustily</i>

367
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,884
<i>So it's rather safe to say</i>

368
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:34,517
<i>That it seems that</i>
<i>it may turn out to be</i>

369
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:38,359
<i>It feels that it will undoubtedly</i>

370
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:44,459
<i>It looks like a rather</i>
<i>blustery day today</i>

371
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:47,801
<i>It seems that</i>
<i>it may turn out to be</i>

372
00:26:47,872 --> 00:26:49,897
<i>Feels that it will undoubtedly</i>

373
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:54,571
<i>Looks like a rather blustery day today</i>

374
00:26:56,715 --> 00:27:00,742
Fortunately, Pooh's thoughtful spot
was in a sheltered place.

375
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:04,380
Now he sat down and tried
hard to think of something.

376
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,981
Think, think, think, think, think.

377
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:12,923
Think, think, think.

378
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:17,731
Say, what's wrong, sonny?
Got yourself a headache?

379
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:22,501
- No, I was just thinking.
- Is that so? What about?

380
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:26,237
L... Oh, bother.
You made me forget.

381
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:30,338
If I was you, I'd think about
skedaddling out of here.

382
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:33,782
- Why?
- 'Cause it's "Winds-day."

383
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:38,448
"Winds-day"? Oh!

384
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:41,458
Then I think I shall wish
everyone a happy "Winds-day"...

385
00:27:41,526 --> 00:27:46,623
and I shall begin with
my very dear friend, Piglet.

386
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:51,431
Now, Piglet lived in the middle
of the forest in a very grand house...

387
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,528
in the middle of a beech tree.

388
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:56,472
And Piglet loved it very much.

389
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:59,533
Whew, yes.

390
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:03,809
Whoops. You see, it's been
in the family a long time.

391
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:06,646
It belonged to my grandfather.

392
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:11,314
Oh, that's his name up there,
"Trespassers Will."

393
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:13,789
That's short for "Trespassers William."

394
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:17,055
- Trespassers William?
- Yes.

395
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:19,722
And Grandma... Oh.

396
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:22,289
She called him T.W.

397
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:25,063
That's even shorter.

398
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:27,263
Yes, yes, yes.

399
00:28:27,338 --> 00:28:29,602
- And on this blustery day...
- Whoo!

400
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:31,733
The wind was giving you
a bit of a bother.

401
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:34,779
Now, you've been here before.

402
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:36,837
I don't mind the leaves
that are leaving.

403
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:40,817
It's the leaves that are coming.
Whoops!

404
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:46,983
- Happy "Winds-day," Piglet.
- Well, it isn't very happy for me.

405
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:51,927
- Where are you going, Piglet?
- That's what I'm asking myself, where?

406
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:55,022
W-Whoops! P-P-Pooh!

407
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,466
And what do you think
you will answer yourself?

408
00:28:57,535 --> 00:28:59,935
Oh, oh, oh! I'm unravelling.

409
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:07,678
Whoops!
Oh, t-t-that was a c-c-close one!

410
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:10,681
Hang on tight, Piglet.

411
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,343
Oh, dear.
Oh, d-d-dear, dear!

412
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:20,686
Look, Mama, look! A kite!

413
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,489
Oh, my goodness, it's Piglet!

414
00:29:23,561 --> 00:29:27,053
Happy "Winds-day," Kanga.
Happy "Winds-day," Roo.

415
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:29,498
Can I fly Piglet next, Pooh?

416
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:31,865
Oh, dear.
Oh, d-d-dear, dear!

417
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:36,137
There, that should
stand against anything.

418
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:41,509
Oh, oh! Help, help!
Somebody, s-s-save me!

419
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:46,676
- Happy "Winds-day," Eeyore.
- Thanks for noticing me.

420
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:49,151
Oh, b-b-b-bother!

421
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:54,157
Ah. Oh, what a refreshing
day for harvesting.

422
00:29:54,225 --> 00:29:59,663
- Happy Winds-day, Rabbit.
- Pooh bear, Stop! Oh, go back! Oh, no!

423
00:29:59,731 --> 00:30:02,325
Oh, no! Oh, no!

424
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,425
Oh, yes!

425
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:08,097
Well, next time, I hope he blows
right through my rutabaga patch.

426
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:22,885
- Whoops!
- Huh? Who, who, who? Who is it?

427
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:26,788
It's me.
P-P-Please, may I come in?

428
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:29,088
Well, I say now.

429
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:33,426
Someone has pasted
Piglet on my window.

430
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,591
Well, well! Pooh too.

431
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:38,932
This is a surprise.

432
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:41,130
Do come in and make yourselves...

433
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:47,102
- comfortable.
- Oh!

434
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:52,275
Am I correct in assuming it is
a rather blustery day outside?

435
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:55,979
Yes, sir, Owl. It's a very,
very blustery day outside.

436
00:30:56,054 --> 00:30:58,648
Oh, yes. That reminds me.

437
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:01,920
Happy "Winds-day," Owl.

438
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:06,896
My good fellow, I wouldn't go
so far as to call it a "Winds-day"...

439
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:08,990
just a gentle spring zephyr.

440
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:12,298
Excuse me, Owl, but...

441
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,668
is there honey in that pot?

442
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:18,607
Oh, yes, yes, of course. Help yourself.
Now, as I was saying...

443
00:31:18,676 --> 00:31:23,010
this is just a mild spring zephyr
compared to the big wind of'67.

444
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:26,778
Or was it, uh, '76?
Oh, well, no matter.

445
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:31,914
- Oh, I remember the big blow well.
- L'll remember this one too.

446
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:35,949
It was the year my Aunt Clara
went to visit her cousin.

447
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:39,519
Now, her cousin was not only
gifted on the glockenspiel...

448
00:31:39,597 --> 00:31:44,694
but being a screech owl, also sang
soprano in the London opera.

449
00:31:47,171 --> 00:31:50,368
- Thank you, Piglet.
- You see, her constant practicing...

450
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:55,469
so unnerved my aunt that
she laid a sea gull egg by mistake.

451
00:32:06,524 --> 00:32:08,685
Oh, dear.
Oh, d-d-dear, dear.

452
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:16,126
Well, I say now, someone has...

453
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:20,364
Pooh, did you do that?

454
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:23,566
I don't think so.

455
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:26,371
As soon as Christopher Robin
heard of the disaster...

456
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:29,311
he hurried to the scene
of Owl's misfortune.

457
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:32,974
What a pity.

458
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:36,487
Owl, I don't think we will
ever be able to fix it.

459
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:40,320
If you ask me,
when a house looks like that...

460
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:44,384
- it's time to find another one.
- That's a very good idea, Eeyore.

461
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:48,831
Might take a day or two,
but l'll find a new one.

462
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:53,394
Good, that will just give me time
to tell you about my Uncle Clyde...

463
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:55,496
a very independent barn owl.

464
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:59,339
He didn't give a hoot for tradition.
He became enamored of a pussycat...

465
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:02,345
and went to sea
in a beautiful pea-green boat.

466
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:08,450
Owl talked from page 41 to page 62.

467
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:14,719
And on page 62, the blustery day
turned into a blustery night.

468
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:18,353
To Pooh, it was a very anxious
sort of night...

469
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:21,921
filled with anxious sorts of noises.

470
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,700
And one of the noises was a sound
that had never been heard before.

471
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:33,703
Ah, is that you, Piglet?

472
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:42,314
W-Well, tell me about it
tomorrow, Eeyore?

473
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:47,381
Oh, come in,
Christopher Robin.

474
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:53,624
Now Pooh, being a bear
of very little brain...

475
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:57,065
decided to invite
the new sound in.

476
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:05,836
Hello, out there.

477
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:08,674
Oh, I hope nobody answers.

478
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:15,644
- Hello, I'm Tigger!
- Oh. You scared me.

479
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:19,850
Yeah, sure I did.
Everyone's scared of tiggers.

480
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:21,949
- Uh, who are you?
- I'm Pooh.

481
00:34:22,026 --> 00:34:25,325
Oh, a pooh. Sure.

482
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:28,297
- What's a pooh?
- You're sitting on one.

483
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:31,494
I am? Oh, well, glad to meet ya.
Name's Tigger.

484
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:36,199
T-I, double "guh," "err."
That spells "Tigger."

485
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:38,299
But what is a tigger?

486
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:42,335
Well, he asked for it!

487
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,313
<i>The wonderful thing about tiggers</i>
<i>is tiggers are wonderful things</i>

488
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:48,147
<i>Their tops are made out of rubber</i>
<i>Their bottoms are made out of springs</i>

489
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:50,847
<i>They're bouncy, trouncy, flouncy</i>
<i>pouncy fun, fun, fun, fun, fun</i>

490
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:53,857
<i>But the most wonderful thing</i>
<i>about tiggers is I'm the only one</i>

491
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:57,292
<i>I'm the only one</i>

492
00:34:57,361 --> 00:35:01,730
- Then what's that over there?
- Huh? Oh, hey, hey. Look, look, look.

493
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:05,860
Oh, what a strange-looking creature.

494
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:11,204
Look at those beady little eyes,
and that "purrposturous" chin...

495
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:15,644
and those "rickydiculus"
striped pajamas.

496
00:35:15,713 --> 00:35:21,913
- Looked like another tigger to me.
- Oh, no, it's not. I'm the only tigger.

497
00:35:21,986 --> 00:35:25,353
Watch me scare the stripes
off of this impostor.

498
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:32,862
Is-Is-Is... Is he gone?

499
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:36,559
All except the tail.
He's gone.

500
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:40,229
Uh, you can come out now, Tigger.

501
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:42,738
Tigger?

502
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:46,538
- Hello, I'm Tigger.
- You said that.

503
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:50,377
- Oh? Well, did I say I was hungry?
- I don't think so.

504
00:35:50,448 --> 00:35:53,440
Well, then l'll say it.
I'm hungry.

505
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:55,543
Oh, not for honey, I hope.

506
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,713
Honey! Oh, boy, honey!

507
00:35:57,788 --> 00:36:02,851
- That's what tiggers like best.
- I was afraid of that.

508
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:06,453
Oh, say.

509
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:12,536
Yuck! Tiggers don't like honey!

510
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:18,405
- But you said that you liked...
- That icky, sticky stuff is only fit
for "heffalumps" and "woozles."

511
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:20,467
You mean elephants and weasels.

512
00:36:20,545 --> 00:36:22,479
That's what I said...
"heffalumps" and "woozles."

513
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:27,644
Well, what do heffa... lalla...
What do they do?

514
00:36:27,718 --> 00:36:31,154
- Oh, nothin' much. Just steal honey.
- Steal honey?

515
00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:36,455
Yeah, they sure do. Well, I'd better be
bouncing along now, chum. Cheerio!

516
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:39,462
<i>The wonderful thing about tiggers</i>
<i>is tiggers are wonderful things</i>

517
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:42,328
<i>Their tops are made out of rubber</i>
<i>their bottoms are made out of springs</i>

518
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,130
<i>They're bouncy, trouncy, flouncy</i>
<i>pouncy fun, fun, fun, fun, fun</i>

519
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,967
<i>But the most wonderful thing</i>
<i>about tiggers is I'm the only one</i>

520
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,132
<i>I'm the only one</i>

521
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:57,480
Well, if what Tigger said was true...

522
00:36:57,548 --> 00:37:01,143
and there really were
"heffalumps" and "woozles" about...

523
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:04,154
there was only
one thing to do:

524
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:08,181
Take drastic precautions
to protect his precious honey.

525
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:17,967
Oh, hello.

526
00:37:18,035 --> 00:37:23,496
Am I glad to see you.
It's more friendly with two.

527
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:26,600
Now, you go that way...

528
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:28,702
and l'll go this way.

529
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:36,212
You didn't see anything, did you?

530
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:38,949
Neither did I.

531
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:42,619
Now, the very blustery night...

532
00:37:42,693 --> 00:37:45,025
turned into a very rainy night...

533
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:47,690
and Pooh kept his lonely vigil...

534
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:51,997
hour after hour after hour.

535
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:54,128
Until, at last...

536
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:58,574
Pooh fell fast asleep
and began to dream.

537
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:05,808
"Heffalumps" and "woozles."

538
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:10,650
"Heffalumps" and "woozles" steal honey.

539
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:14,487
Beware. Beware.

540
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:16,549
<i>They're black, they're brown</i>
<i>They're up, they're down</i>

541
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:18,652
<i>They're in, they're out</i>
<i>They're all about</i>

542
00:38:18,729 --> 00:38:20,720
<i>They're far, they're near</i>
<i>They're gone, they're here</i>

543
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,823
<i>They're quick and slick</i>
<i>They're insincere</i>

544
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:26,495
<i>Beware, beware</i>
<i>be a very wary bear</i>

545
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:30,563
<i>A "heffalump"or "woozle"</i>
<i>is very "confusle"</i>

546
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:34,771
<i>A "heffalump"or "woozle's"</i>
<i>very sly, sly, sly, sly</i>

547
00:38:34,845 --> 00:38:38,576
<i>They come in ones and "twosles"</i>
<i>but if they so "choosles"</i>

548
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:42,779
<i>Before your eyes you'll see them</i>
<i>multiply, ply, ply, ply</i>

549
00:38:42,853 --> 00:38:46,687
<i>They're extraordinary</i>
<i>so better be wary</i>

550
00:38:46,757 --> 00:38:50,716
<i>Because they come in every</i>
<i>shape and size, size, size, size</i>

551
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:54,424
<i>If honey's what you covet</i>
<i>you'll find that they love it</i>

552
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:58,366
<i>Because they guzzle up</i>
<i>the thing you prize</i>

553
00:38:58,436 --> 00:39:00,700
<i>They're green, they're blue</i>
<i>They're pink, they're white</i>

554
00:39:00,771 --> 00:39:02,932
<i>They're round, they're square</i>
<i>They're a terrible sight</i>

555
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:06,773
<i>They tie themselves in horrible knots</i>
<i>They come in stripes or polka dots</i>

556
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:10,871
<i>Beware, beware</i>
<i>be a very wary bear</i>

557
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:50,509
<i>They're extraordinary</i>
<i>so better be wary</i>

558
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:54,847
<i>Because they come in every</i>
<i>shape and size, size, size, size</i>

559
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:58,878
<i>If honey's what you covet</i>
<i>you'll find that they love it</i>

560
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:03,723
<i>Because they'll guzzle up</i>
<i>the things you prize</i>

561
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:05,921
<i>They're black, they're brown</i>
<i>They're up, they're down</i>

562
00:41:05,996 --> 00:41:08,021
<i>They're in, they're out</i>
<i>They're all about</i>

563
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:10,089
<i>They're far, they're near</i>
<i>They're gone, they're here</i>

564
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:12,158
<i>They're quick and slick</i>
<i>They're insincere</i>

565
00:41:12,236 --> 00:41:15,831
<i>Beware, beware, beware, beware</i>

566
00:41:15,906 --> 00:41:19,239
<i>Beware</i>

567
00:41:28,118 --> 00:41:32,680
Is it raining in there?
It's raining out here too.

568
00:41:32,756 --> 00:41:36,920
As a matter of fact, it was raining
all over the Hundred-Acre Wood.

569
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:40,862
There was a thunder storm
on page 71.

570
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:45,732
And on page 73,
there was a bit of a cloudburst.

571
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:50,137
It rained and it rained
and it rained.

572
00:41:50,207 --> 00:41:52,732
<i>The rain, rain, rain</i>
<i>came down, down, down</i>

573
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:54,869
<i>In rushing rising rivulets</i>

574
00:41:54,945 --> 00:41:57,106
<i>Till the river crept out of its bed</i>

575
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,376
<i>And crept right into Piglet's</i>

576
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:01,441
<i>Poor Piglet he was frightened</i>

577
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:04,113
<i>With quite a rightful fright</i>

578
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:09,251
<i>And so in desperation</i>
<i>a message he did write</i>

579
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:14,256
Help! P-P-Piglet... Me!

580
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:17,664
<i>He placed it in a bottle</i>

581
00:42:17,735 --> 00:42:21,671
<i>And it floated out of sight</i>

582
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:24,333
<i>And the rain, rain, rain</i>
<i>came down, down, down</i>

583
00:42:24,408 --> 00:42:26,808
<i>So Piglet started bailing</i>

584
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:36,086
<i>He was unaware atop his chair</i>
<i>while bailing he was sailing</i>

585
00:42:36,153 --> 00:42:38,587
<i>And the rain, rain, rain</i>
<i>came down, down, down</i>

586
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:40,647
<i>And the flood rose</i>
<i>up, up, upper</i>

587
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:43,022
<i>Pooh too was caught</i>
<i>and so he thought</i>

588
00:42:43,093 --> 00:42:45,323
<i>I must rescue my supper</i>

589
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:50,095
<i>Ten honey pots he rescued</i>
<i>enough to see him through</i>

590
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:52,658
<i>But as he sopped up his supper</i>

591
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:56,263
<i>The river sopped up Pooh</i>

592
00:42:57,575 --> 00:43:00,009
<i>And the water twirled</i>
<i>and tossed him</i>

593
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:02,671
<i>In a honey pot canoe</i>

594
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:04,839
<i>Rain, rain, rain</i>
<i>came down, down, down</i>

595
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:07,179
<i>When the rain, rain, rain</i>
<i>came down, down, down</i>

596
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:11,654
So the Hundred-Acre Wood
got floodier and floodier.

597
00:43:11,722 --> 00:43:14,691
But the water couldn't come up
to Christopher Robin's house...

598
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:17,352
so that's where
everyone was gathering.

599
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:20,022
It was a time of great excitement.

600
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:22,156
But in the midst
of all the excitement...

601
00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:26,498
Eeyore stubbornly stuck to his task
of house-hunting for Owl.

602
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:32,031
There's one.
Cozy cottage, nice location.

603
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:35,169
A bit damp for Owl, though.

604
00:43:35,245 --> 00:43:38,578
Meanwhile, little Roo made
an important discovery.

605
00:43:38,649 --> 00:43:43,245
Look! I've rescued a bottle.
And it's got something in it too.

606
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,817
It's a message, and it says:

607
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:50,257
"Help! P-P-Piglet... Me!"

608
00:43:50,327 --> 00:43:53,387
Owl, you fly over to Piglet's house...

609
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,728
and tell him we'll make a rescue.

610
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:58,734
A rescue? Yes, yes.
Of course, of course.

611
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:02,537
So Owl flew out over the flood...

612
00:44:02,606 --> 00:44:05,370
and he soon spotted
two tiny objects below him.

613
00:44:05,442 --> 00:44:09,378
One was little Piglet
caught in the whirlpool...

614
00:44:09,446 --> 00:44:13,280
and the other was Pooh trying to get
the last bit of honey from the pot.

615
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:15,375
Yum-yum.

616
00:44:15,452 --> 00:44:20,389
Oh, Owl, I don't mean to c-c-complain,
but I'm afraid I'm scared.

617
00:44:20,457 --> 00:44:23,449
Now, now, Piglet, chin up
and all that sort of thing.

618
00:44:23,527 --> 00:44:27,554
A rescue is being thought of.
Be brave, little Piglet.

619
00:44:27,631 --> 00:44:31,567
It's awfully hard to be b-b-brave
when you're such a small animal.

620
00:44:31,635 --> 00:44:35,594
Then to divert your small mind
from your unfortunate predicament...

621
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:39,302
I shall tell you
an amusing anecdote.

622
00:44:41,145 --> 00:44:43,613
It concerns a distant cousin of mine...

623
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:46,081
who became so frightened
during a flood that he...

624
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:48,414
I beg your pardon, Owl,
but I th-think...

625
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:52,387
we're coming to a "flutterfall"...
a "flatterfall"...a very big waterfall.

626
00:44:52,456 --> 00:44:54,754
Please, no interruptions.

627
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:17,412
Ah, there you are, Pooh bear.
Now, to continue my story...

628
00:45:17,481 --> 00:45:21,144
Look, there's Pooh.
Over here, Pooh!

629
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:23,277
Oh, hello, Christopher Robin.

630
00:45:23,353 --> 00:45:27,790
Pooh, thank goodness you're safe.
Have you seen Piglet?

631
00:45:27,858 --> 00:45:30,019
Excuse me, I have...

632
00:45:30,094 --> 00:45:33,461
What I mean is, here I am.

633
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:37,489
- Pooh, you rescued Piglet.
- I did?

634
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:40,594
Yes, and it was
a very brave thing to do.

635
00:45:40,671 --> 00:45:42,263
It was?

636
00:45:42,339 --> 00:45:44,933
- You are our hero.
- I am?

637
00:45:45,008 --> 00:45:49,809
And as soon as the flood is over,
I shall give you a hero party.

638
00:45:54,852 --> 00:45:56,843
Attention, everybody.

639
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:01,948
Now, this party is a hero party
because of what someone did.

640
00:46:02,025 --> 00:46:07,019
- And that someone is...
- I found it.

641
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:10,794
- Found what, Eeyore?
- House for Owl.

642
00:46:10,868 --> 00:46:14,463
I say, Eeyore, good show!

643
00:46:14,538 --> 00:46:17,871
Oh, isn't that wonderful.
Where is it, Eeyore?

644
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:21,707
If you want to follow me,
l'll show it to you.

645
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:25,138
So everyone followed Eeyore.

646
00:46:25,215 --> 00:46:29,709
Then, to the surprise of all,
Eeyore stopped right in front of...

647
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:32,153
Piglet's house?

648
00:46:32,222 --> 00:46:34,656
Why are you
stopping here, Eeyore?

649
00:46:34,725 --> 00:46:38,183
This is it, Owl's new house.

650
00:46:38,262 --> 00:46:40,355
Oh, dear, mercy me!

651
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:43,024
Oh, dear, mercy me too!

652
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:45,534
Name's on it and everything.

653
00:46:45,602 --> 00:46:49,868
W-O-L, that spells Owl.

654
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:53,273
Bless my soul, so it does.

655
00:46:53,343 --> 00:46:55,709
Well, what do you think of it?

656
00:46:55,779 --> 00:47:00,546
It is a nice house, Eeyore, but...

657
00:47:00,617 --> 00:47:04,883
It is a lovely house, Eeyore, but...

658
00:47:04,955 --> 00:47:09,892
It's... It's the best house
in the whole world.

659
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,292
Tell them it's your house, Piglet.

660
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:14,421
No, Pooh.

661
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:19,265
This house belongs
to our very good friend...

662
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:22,032
Owl.

663
00:47:22,105 --> 00:47:24,972
But, Piglet, where will you live?

664
00:47:25,042 --> 00:47:28,034
Well, l...
I guess I shall live...

665
00:47:29,112 --> 00:47:31,307
I suppose l-I shall live...

666
00:47:31,381 --> 00:47:35,442
With me! You shall live with me.
Won't you, Piglet?

667
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:37,885
With you?

668
00:47:37,955 --> 00:47:42,915
Oh, thank you, Pooh bear.
Of course I will.

669
00:47:42,993 --> 00:47:46,588
Piglet, that was a very
grand thing to do.

670
00:47:46,663 --> 00:47:49,427
A heroic thing to do.

671
00:47:49,499 --> 00:47:51,797
Christopher Robin...

672
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:57,102
can you make a one-hero party
into a two-hero party?

673
00:47:57,174 --> 00:47:59,267
Of course we can...

674
00:47:59,343 --> 00:48:01,607
silly old bear.

675
00:48:01,678 --> 00:48:04,772
And so, Pooh was a hero
for saving Piglet...

676
00:48:04,848 --> 00:48:09,114
and Piglet was a hero for giving Owl
his grand home in the beech tree.

677
00:48:09,186 --> 00:48:13,282
<i>We never will forget</i>
<i>our hero of the wet</i>

678
00:48:13,357 --> 00:48:17,293
<i>Our quick thinking</i>
<i>unsinking Pooh bear</i>

679
00:48:17,361 --> 00:48:21,457
<i>And Piglet who indeed</i>
<i>helped out a friend in need</i>

680
00:48:21,531 --> 00:48:23,965
<i>Truly they're the heroes of the day</i>

681
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:29,973
<i>So we say, Hip hip hooray</i>
<i>for the piglet and the pooh</i>

682
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:35,444
- <i>Piglet and Pooh, we salute you</i>
- What's all that stompin' and singin'
and silly shenanigans?

683
00:48:35,512 --> 00:48:37,309
<i>And generosity</i>

684
00:48:37,381 --> 00:48:41,317
<i>Hip hip hooray</i>
<i>Hip hip hooray</i>

685
00:48:41,385 --> 00:48:44,877
<i>Hip hip hooray for Winnie the Pooh</i>

686
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:48,983
And Piglet too!

687
00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:53,120
I sure like bouncing.
Wasn't that fun, Piglet?

688
00:48:53,196 --> 00:48:59,135
Yes, Pooh, b-but the best part
is when it st-stops.

689
00:48:59,202 --> 00:49:03,195
Well, in the next chapter,
there's a great deal of bouncing.

690
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:06,140
There is? Oh.

691
00:49:06,209 --> 00:49:08,302
I think that I just remembered...

692
00:49:08,378 --> 00:49:10,471
something that
I forgot to do yesterday...

693
00:49:10,547 --> 00:49:13,209
and-and shan't be able
to do tomorrow.

694
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:17,219
So I suppose I really ought to go back
and-and do it n-now.

695
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:20,688
- Uh, good-bye, Pooh.
- Good-bye, Piglet.

696
00:49:20,757 --> 00:49:23,749
Now, is the next chapter all about me?

697
00:49:23,827 --> 00:49:28,855
- No, no. It's mostly about Tigger.
- Oh, bother.

698
00:49:28,932 --> 00:49:31,662
- But you're in it.
- Oh, good.

699
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:33,726
What will I be doing?

700
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:38,102
Well, Pooh, you'll be sitting
in your thoughtful spot...

701
00:49:38,175 --> 00:49:40,575
thinking, as usual.

702
00:49:40,606 --> 00:49:43,803
Think, think. Think, think, think.
Think. Think.

703
00:49:43,875 --> 00:49:46,537
And while he was thinking,
all of a sudden...

704
00:49:46,612 --> 00:49:49,843
Hello, Pooh!
I'm Tigger!

705
00:49:49,915 --> 00:49:53,476
T-I, double "guh," "err."
That spells "Tigger."

706
00:49:53,552 --> 00:49:56,180
Yeah, I know.

707
00:49:56,254 --> 00:50:00,213
- You've bounced me before.
- I did?

708
00:50:00,292 --> 00:50:04,854
Oh, yeah! I "recoggonize" you. You're
the one that's stuffed with fluff.

709
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:09,560
- Yeah. And you're sitting on it.
- Yeah. And it's comfy too.

710
00:50:09,635 --> 00:50:13,366
Well, I gotta go now.
I got a lot of bouncing to do.

711
00:50:13,438 --> 00:50:15,770
T-T-F-N.
Ta-ta for now.

712
00:50:16,975 --> 00:50:19,205
Well, there goes Tigger...

713
00:50:19,277 --> 00:50:22,542
always bouncing in on his friends
when they least expect him.

714
00:50:24,349 --> 00:50:26,874
Oh, hello, Piglet!
I'm Tigger.

715
00:50:26,952 --> 00:50:29,546
Oh, Tigger.
You sc-scared me.

716
00:50:29,621 --> 00:50:31,714
Oh, shucks.

717
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:33,883
That was just
one of my little bounces.

718
00:50:33,959 --> 00:50:36,894
It was?
Oh, thank you, Tigger.

719
00:50:36,962 --> 00:50:41,729
Yeah. I'm saving my best bounce
for old long-ears!

720
00:50:42,801 --> 00:50:44,462
Ta-ta!

721
00:50:44,536 --> 00:50:46,800
<i>Hum de dum, dum</i>
<i>Hum de dum, dum</i>

722
00:50:46,872 --> 00:50:49,432
<i>Hum de dum, dum</i>
<i>Dum de dum, dum</i>

723
00:50:49,508 --> 00:50:52,204
There. There. That should do it.

724
00:50:53,712 --> 00:50:56,545
Oh, no. Stop, stop!

725
00:50:56,615 --> 00:50:58,742
Hello, Rabbit. I'm Tigger.

726
00:50:58,817 --> 00:51:02,878
- T-I, double "guh"...
- Please! Please! Don't spell it.

727
00:51:02,954 --> 00:51:07,948
Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Just...
Just look at my beautiful garden.

728
00:51:08,026 --> 00:51:10,790
Yuck! And messy, isn't it?

729
00:51:10,862 --> 00:51:14,992
Messy? Messy!
It's ruined! It's ruined, Tigger.

730
00:51:15,067 --> 00:51:19,060
Oh, why don't you ever
stop bouncing?

731
00:51:19,137 --> 00:51:22,595
Why? That's what tiggers do best.

732
00:51:22,674 --> 00:51:25,643
<i>The wonderful thing about tiggers</i>
<i>is tiggers are wonderful things</i>

733
00:51:25,711 --> 00:51:28,475
<i>Their tops are made out of rubber</i>
<i>Their bottoms are made out of springs</i>

734
00:51:28,547 --> 00:51:31,243
<i>They're bouncy, trouncy, flouncy</i>
<i>pouncy, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun</i>

735
00:51:31,316 --> 00:51:33,511
<i>But the most wonderful thing</i>
<i>about tiggers is I'm the only one</i>

736
00:51:33,585 --> 00:51:36,247
<i>I'm the only one</i>

737
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:44,124
Order. Order, please.

738
00:51:44,196 --> 00:51:50,431
Now, I say Tigger's getting
so bouncy nowadays that
it's time we taught him a lesson.

739
00:51:50,502 --> 00:51:52,800
No matter
how much we like him...

740
00:51:52,871 --> 00:51:56,102
you can't deny
he just bounces too much.

741
00:51:56,174 --> 00:51:58,165
Ah, e-excuse me, Rabbit.

742
00:51:58,243 --> 00:52:03,010
But, uh, perhaps if we could think
of a way of"un-bouncing" Tigger...

743
00:52:03,081 --> 00:52:05,106
well, it would be
a very good idea, huh?

744
00:52:05,183 --> 00:52:10,211
Exactly! Just what I feel.
What do you feel, Pooh?

745
00:52:14,926 --> 00:52:17,360
- Pooh!
- Ah...

746
00:52:17,429 --> 00:52:20,694
Haven't you been listening
to what Rabbit's been saying?

747
00:52:20,766 --> 00:52:26,671
I listened, but then I had
a small piece of fluff in my ear.

748
00:52:26,738 --> 00:52:31,675
- Could you say it again, please, Rabbit?
- Well, where should I start from?

749
00:52:31,743 --> 00:52:34,712
From the moment
the fluff got in my ear.

750
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:37,078
Well, when was that?

751
00:52:37,149 --> 00:52:40,346
I don't know.
I couldn't hear properly.

752
00:52:40,418 --> 00:52:46,084
Pooh, we were just trying to think of
a way to get the bounce out ofTigger.

753
00:52:46,158 --> 00:52:48,991
Oh, I've got a splendid idea.
Now, listen.

754
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:52,257
We'll take Tigger
for a long explore, see?

755
00:52:52,330 --> 00:52:54,730
Someplace where he's never been...

756
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,598
- and we lose him there.
- Lose him?

757
00:52:57,669 --> 00:53:00,103
Oh, we'll find him again,
next morning.

758
00:53:00,172 --> 00:53:02,697
And mark my words,
he'll be a humble tigger...

759
00:53:02,774 --> 00:53:04,765
a small-and-sad tigger...

760
00:53:04,843 --> 00:53:08,210
an "Oh, Rabbit,
am-l-glad-to-see-you" tigger.

761
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:11,272
And it'll take the bounces
out of him, that's why.

762
00:53:11,349 --> 00:53:13,613
Now, all in favor, say, "aye."

763
00:53:13,685 --> 00:53:16,620
Aye. Pooh?

764
00:53:16,688 --> 00:53:19,623
- Pooh!
- Uh, here.

765
00:53:19,691 --> 00:53:23,127
Good. Just good.
Motion carried.

766
00:53:28,033 --> 00:53:31,298
So it was agreed that they
would start the next morning...

767
00:53:31,369 --> 00:53:35,567
which, incidentally,
turned out cold and misty.

768
00:53:40,378 --> 00:53:45,077
Pooh, as usual, had a little
something along to sustain himself.

769
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:52,989
And now, as Tigger kept bouncing
farther and farther into the mist...

770
00:53:53,058 --> 00:53:56,459
Rabbit thought it was
a good time to lose Tigger.

771
00:53:56,528 --> 00:54:00,555
Now's our chance.
Quick! In here. Hide.

772
00:54:05,904 --> 00:54:08,304
Tigger's lost now, isn't he, Rabbit?

773
00:54:08,373 --> 00:54:11,638
Oh, he's lost, all right, Piglet.

774
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:15,908
Oh, goody. This is lots of fun, Pooh.

775
00:54:23,755 --> 00:54:27,191
My splendid idea worked.

776
00:54:27,259 --> 00:54:29,693
Now, home we go.

777
00:54:29,761 --> 00:54:33,629
Good! Yum-yum.
It's time for lunch.

778
00:54:33,698 --> 00:54:37,190
- Halloo!
- Oh, my goodness. Hide!

779
00:54:37,269 --> 00:54:40,102
Halloo!

780
00:54:43,508 --> 00:54:46,636
That's funny.
They must be lost.

781
00:54:48,046 --> 00:54:51,538
Hello!

782
00:54:51,616 --> 00:54:57,054
- Hey, you blokes. Where are ya?
- He...

783
00:54:57,122 --> 00:55:00,148
- Shush.
- I am shushed.

784
00:55:00,225 --> 00:55:04,389
Hey, where in the heck
are you guys?

785
00:55:18,710 --> 00:55:20,974
Halloo!

786
00:55:22,247 --> 00:55:26,240
Rabbit? Piglet?
Where are you?

787
00:55:26,318 --> 00:55:28,343
Halloo!

788
00:55:30,322 --> 00:55:33,519
Hooray!
Hooray, we've done it.

789
00:55:33,591 --> 00:55:37,049
Now, come on, hurry.
Let's head for home.

790
00:55:37,128 --> 00:55:40,859
Well, Rabbit was certain that everything
was going according to plan...

791
00:55:40,932 --> 00:55:43,730
and so it seemed to be.

792
00:55:43,802 --> 00:55:45,997
But sometime later...

793
00:55:46,071 --> 00:55:49,905
on the bottom of page 123...

794
00:55:57,282 --> 00:56:01,548
It's a funny thing how everything
looks the same in the mist.

795
00:56:01,619 --> 00:56:05,350
He's right, Piglet.
It's the very same sand pit.

796
00:56:05,423 --> 00:56:07,288
I think so too, Pooh.

797
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:10,522
Well, it's lucky I know
the forest so well, or...

798
00:56:10,595 --> 00:56:12,688
or, or we might get lost.

799
00:56:12,764 --> 00:56:15,255
Well, come on. Follow me.

800
00:56:15,333 --> 00:56:18,894
Now, Pooh was getting tired
of seeing the same sand pit...

801
00:56:18,970 --> 00:56:22,701
and he suspected it
of following them about.

802
00:56:22,774 --> 00:56:25,971
Because whichever
direction they started in...

803
00:56:26,044 --> 00:56:29,707
they always seemed
to end up at it.

804
00:56:36,354 --> 00:56:38,413
- Uh, er, Rabbit?
- Yes?

805
00:56:38,490 --> 00:56:40,481
Say, Rabbit, how would it be...

806
00:56:40,558 --> 00:56:44,153
if as soon as we're
out of sight of this old pit...

807
00:56:44,229 --> 00:56:48,325
- we just try to find it again?
- What's the good of that?

808
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:51,301
Well, you see,
we keep looking for home...

809
00:56:51,369 --> 00:56:53,394
but we keep finding this pit.

810
00:56:53,471 --> 00:56:58,340
So I just thought that if we looked
for this pit we might find home.

811
00:56:58,410 --> 00:57:00,742
I don't see much sense in that.

812
00:57:00,812 --> 00:57:02,837
If I walked away from this pit...

813
00:57:02,914 --> 00:57:06,247
and then walked back to it,
of course I should find it.

814
00:57:06,317 --> 00:57:09,411
L'll prove it to you. Wait here.

815
00:57:12,824 --> 00:57:16,157
So Pooh and Piglet
waited in the mist for Rabbit.

816
00:57:16,227 --> 00:57:18,252
And they waited...

817
00:57:18,329 --> 00:57:21,787
and waited, and waited.

818
00:57:21,866 --> 00:57:25,029
And all the while, Pooh's
thoughts kept returning...

819
00:57:25,103 --> 00:57:27,196
to his honey pots at home.

820
00:57:33,044 --> 00:57:35,342
W-W-What was that, Pooh?

821
00:57:35,413 --> 00:57:37,938
My tummy rumbled.

822
00:57:38,016 --> 00:57:40,507
Now then, come on.
Let's go home.

823
00:57:40,585 --> 00:57:43,179
But, Pooh, do you know the way?

824
00:57:43,254 --> 00:57:47,350
No, Piglet, but there are 12 pots
of honey in my cupboard...

825
00:57:47,425 --> 00:57:49,689
and they have been
calling to my tummy.

826
00:57:49,761 --> 00:57:52,491
- They have?
- Yes, Piglet.

827
00:57:52,564 --> 00:57:56,227
I couldn't hear them before
because Rabbit would talk.

828
00:57:56,301 --> 00:57:58,496
I think I know where
they're calling from.

829
00:57:58,570 --> 00:58:02,006
So come on.
We'll just follow my tummy.

830
00:58:02,073 --> 00:58:04,564
Well, they walked off together...

831
00:58:04,642 --> 00:58:07,236
and for a long time
Piglet said nothing...

832
00:58:07,312 --> 00:58:11,043
so as not to interrupt
Pooh's honey pots.

833
00:58:11,116 --> 00:58:14,517
And sure enough,
as the mist got thinner...

834
00:58:14,586 --> 00:58:18,022
and just when Piglet
began to know where he was...

835
00:58:18,089 --> 00:58:22,526
Hey, hello there, you two blokes.
Where have you been?

836
00:58:22,594 --> 00:58:25,028
We've been trying
to find our way back home.

837
00:58:25,096 --> 00:58:29,362
Pooh, I don't think
Rabbit's splendid idea worked.

838
00:58:29,434 --> 00:58:33,200
Say, where is old long-ears, anyway?

839
00:58:33,271 --> 00:58:36,365
He must still be missing
in the mist.

840
00:58:36,441 --> 00:58:40,172
Well, leave it to me.
L'll bounce him out of there!

841
00:58:40,245 --> 00:58:42,770
T-T-F-N. Ta-ta for now.

842
00:58:46,284 --> 00:58:50,550
Meanwhile, Rabbit was still
wandering around in the mist.

843
00:58:50,622 --> 00:58:52,886
By now, he was lost and bewildered.

844
00:58:52,957 --> 00:58:55,289
And to make matters worse...

845
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:58,887
his mind was beginning
to play tricks on him.

846
00:59:01,633 --> 00:59:04,193
What's that?

847
00:59:09,307 --> 00:59:13,573
Pooh? Piglet?

848
00:59:54,485 --> 00:59:56,419
Help!

849
00:59:56,487 --> 00:59:58,478
- Hello, Rabbit!
- Tigger!

850
00:59:58,556 --> 01:00:00,922
B-B-But you're
supposed to be lost.

851
01:00:00,992 --> 01:00:05,122
Aw, Tiggers never get lost,
bunny boy.

852
01:00:05,196 --> 01:00:07,460
Never get lost?

853
01:00:07,532 --> 01:00:09,693
- Of course not.
- Oh, no.

854
01:00:09,767 --> 01:00:14,363
Come on, Rabbit.
Let's go home. Hang on!

855
01:00:14,439 --> 01:00:20,207
So they started back. And Rabbit
was now a humiliated rabbit...

856
01:00:20,278 --> 01:00:22,610
a lost-and-found rabbit...

857
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:26,776
an "Oh-why, oh-why-do-these-things
happen-to-me" rabbit.

858
01:00:28,152 --> 01:00:29,949
And now we come to the next chapter...

859
01:00:30,088 --> 01:00:33,819
in which the first snowfall had
covered the Hundred-Acre Wood.

860
01:00:33,891 --> 01:00:39,591
And in which Tigger learns that
even bouncing can be overdone.

861
01:00:39,664 --> 01:00:44,226
On this day, Roo was waiting
for Tigger to take him out to play.

862
01:00:44,302 --> 01:00:47,237
Mama, when is Tigger
gonna get here?

863
01:00:47,305 --> 01:00:50,866
- Be patient, dear. He'll be...
- Whee!

864
01:00:50,942 --> 01:00:55,038
Well, here I am!
Did I surprise you, Roo?

865
01:00:55,113 --> 01:00:57,980
You sure did!
I like surprises.

866
01:00:58,049 --> 01:01:02,179
- Hello, Mrs. Kanga, ma'am.
- Why, hello, Tigger, dear.

867
01:01:02,253 --> 01:01:04,744
She called me "dear."

868
01:01:04,822 --> 01:01:08,189
Roo, are you ready
for some bouncing?

869
01:01:08,259 --> 01:01:10,989
Yeah! You and me
are good bouncers.

870
01:01:11,062 --> 01:01:13,496
Just a moment, dear.

871
01:01:13,564 --> 01:01:17,159
Hold still. Goodness,
you're bouncy today.

872
01:01:17,235 --> 01:01:20,261
That's what roos do the "best-est."

873
01:01:20,338 --> 01:01:24,741
- Now keep your scarf on.
- Not so tight, Mama.

874
01:01:24,809 --> 01:01:27,835
- Is your sweater warm enough?
- Yes, Mother.

875
01:01:27,912 --> 01:01:31,006
Well, come on, Roo. Let's go!

876
01:01:31,082 --> 01:01:34,017
Tigger, have Roo home
in time for his nap.

877
01:01:34,085 --> 01:01:36,679
And be careful!

878
01:01:36,754 --> 01:01:40,588
Don't worry, Mrs. Kanga.
L'll take care of the little nipper.

879
01:01:46,097 --> 01:01:49,066
<i>Da, da, da, da</i>

880
01:01:49,133 --> 01:01:52,102
<i>Da, da, da, da</i>

881
01:01:52,170 --> 01:01:55,105
Ah! What a perfect day!

882
01:01:55,173 --> 01:01:57,403
Peace and quiet...

883
01:01:57,475 --> 01:02:00,706
and thank goodness, no Tigger.

884
01:02:00,778 --> 01:02:05,477
Say, look, look, look.
If it isn't old long-ears.

885
01:02:05,550 --> 01:02:09,077
Can tiggers ice-skate
as fancy as Mr. Rabbit?

886
01:02:09,153 --> 01:02:13,749
Can tiggers ice-skate?
Why, that's what tiggers do the best.

887
01:02:15,159 --> 01:02:17,150
Whee!

888
01:02:18,329 --> 01:02:21,321
Say, this is a cinch.

889
01:02:21,399 --> 01:02:23,833
Whee!

890
01:02:23,901 --> 01:02:27,928
- Oh, no. Not him!
- Uh-oh, look out. I can't... Watch out!

891
01:02:28,005 --> 01:02:30,269
- It can't be!
- Out of the way! Out of the way!

892
01:02:30,341 --> 01:02:33,674
Look out! I can't... Whoa!

893
01:02:40,551 --> 01:02:44,487
Oh, why does it
always have to be me?

894
01:02:44,555 --> 01:02:47,649
Why, oh, why, oh, why?

895
01:02:47,725 --> 01:02:50,319
Tigger, Tigger, are you all right?

896
01:02:52,897 --> 01:02:57,266
Yuck!
Tiggers don't like ice skating.

897
01:02:57,335 --> 01:03:01,863
So Tigger and Roo went farther
into the Hundred-Acre Wood...

898
01:03:01,939 --> 01:03:04,999
Iooking for something
that tiggers do best.

899
01:03:05,076 --> 01:03:08,011
I bet you can climb trees,
huh, Tigger?

900
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:11,606
Climb trees?
That's what tiggers do best!

901
01:03:11,682 --> 01:03:15,311
Only tiggers don't climb trees.
They bounce them!

902
01:03:15,386 --> 01:03:17,650
Come on, let's go.

903
01:03:24,128 --> 01:03:27,188
I almost bounced
clear out of the book.

904
01:03:27,265 --> 01:03:29,392
Some bouncing, huh?

905
01:03:32,904 --> 01:03:36,067
Say, how did this tree get so high?

906
01:03:38,242 --> 01:03:40,472
Hey. H-H-Hey!

907
01:03:40,545 --> 01:03:43,810
Hey, what's happening now?

908
01:03:43,881 --> 01:03:47,339
Don't swing on a string.
It's much too frail.

909
01:03:47,418 --> 01:03:51,377
The best kind of swing
is a tigger's tail. Whee!

910
01:03:51,456 --> 01:03:54,892
S-S-Stop that, kid. Please.

911
01:03:54,959 --> 01:03:59,396
S-T-O-P, stop.
You're rocking the forest.

912
01:04:01,833 --> 01:04:06,167
- What's the matter, Tigger?
- Whew! Oh, thank goodness.

913
01:04:06,237 --> 01:04:11,265
I was just getting seasick
from seeing too much.

914
01:04:11,342 --> 01:04:15,745
Well, we'll just have to leave Tigger
up in the tree top for a little while.

915
01:04:15,813 --> 01:04:19,214
Because, at the bottom
of the next page...

916
01:04:19,350 --> 01:04:21,318
Pooh is having a problem of his own.

917
01:04:21,385 --> 01:04:24,411
- What are you doing, Pooh?
- Shh!

918
01:04:24,489 --> 01:04:27,754
- Tracking something.
- Tracking what?

919
01:04:27,825 --> 01:04:31,226
Well, that's what I asked myself,
Piglet. What?

920
01:04:33,965 --> 01:04:36,559
And what do you think
you'll answer yourself?

921
01:04:36,634 --> 01:04:39,626
I shall have to wait
until I catch up with it.

922
01:04:39,704 --> 01:04:42,070
Pooh, for a bear
of very little brain...

923
01:04:42,139 --> 01:04:45,131
- you sure are a smart one!
- Thank you, Piglet.

924
01:04:45,209 --> 01:04:47,905
- Aha, ha!
- Oh!

925
01:04:47,979 --> 01:04:50,243
N-N-Now w-w-what?

926
01:04:50,314 --> 01:04:53,909
A very mysterious thing, Piglet.

927
01:04:53,985 --> 01:04:56,920
A whole new set of tracks. See?

928
01:04:56,988 --> 01:04:59,752
And so it seemed to be.

929
01:04:59,824 --> 01:05:02,622
There were the tracks
joining each other here...

930
01:05:02,693 --> 01:05:05,093
getting mixed up
with each other there.

931
01:05:05,162 --> 01:05:10,566
But to Pooh, quite plainly,
four sets of paw marks.

932
01:05:10,635 --> 01:05:14,901
Piglet, whatever it was
that made these tracks...

933
01:05:14,972 --> 01:05:18,135
has now been joined
by a "whatever-it-is."

934
01:05:18,209 --> 01:05:23,511
Y-Y-Yes. A-And all of them
are proceeding in company.

935
01:05:23,581 --> 01:05:26,778
Piglet, I wasn't exactly
expecting company.

936
01:05:26,851 --> 01:05:30,514
N-N-Neither was I, Pooh.

937
01:05:30,588 --> 01:05:34,149
So they went on,
feeling a little anxious now...

938
01:05:34,225 --> 01:05:37,820
in case the animals in front of them
were of hostile intent.

939
01:05:37,895 --> 01:05:39,920
Halloo!

940
01:05:44,201 --> 01:05:46,192
Look, look, Piglet...

941
01:05:46,270 --> 01:05:49,706
there's something
in that tree over there.

942
01:05:49,774 --> 01:05:53,369
- Is it one of the f-f-fiercer animals?
- Halloo!

943
01:05:53,444 --> 01:05:56,709
Yes. It's a "jagular."

944
01:05:56,781 --> 01:06:00,717
W-What do
jagulars d-do, Pooh?

945
01:06:00,785 --> 01:06:06,314
Well, jagulars always call,
"Halloo!"

946
01:06:06,390 --> 01:06:10,622
And when you look up,
they drop on you.

947
01:06:10,695 --> 01:06:12,720
I'm looking down, P-P-Pooh.

948
01:06:12,797 --> 01:06:15,391
Halloo!

949
01:06:15,466 --> 01:06:18,731
Hey, Tigger,
it's Pooh and Piglet.

950
01:06:18,803 --> 01:06:21,397
Pooh! Piglet!

951
01:06:21,472 --> 01:06:26,739
Why, it's only Tigger and Roo.
Come on.

952
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:34,247
Hello, Roo. Hey, what are you
and Tigger doing up there?

953
01:06:34,318 --> 01:06:38,584
I'm all right,
but Tigger's stuck.

954
01:06:38,656 --> 01:06:41,216
Help, somebody! Please!

955
01:06:41,292 --> 01:06:43,920
Get Christopher Robin.

956
01:06:43,995 --> 01:06:49,262
Well, it wasn't too long before word
got back to Christopher Robin and
the others that Tigger was in trouble.

957
01:06:50,968 --> 01:06:54,597
Hello, Pooh.
Hello, Piglet. What's up?

958
01:06:54,672 --> 01:06:56,936
Tigger and Roo are up...

959
01:06:57,008 --> 01:07:01,274
Oh, my goodness.
Roo, how did you get way up there?

960
01:07:01,345 --> 01:07:04,041
Easy, Mama. We bounced up.

961
01:07:04,115 --> 01:07:06,743
Oh, gracious.
Do be careful, dear.

962
01:07:06,817 --> 01:07:10,583
I'm all right, Mama,
but Tigger's stuck.

963
01:07:10,655 --> 01:07:13,783
Oh, what a shame.
That's too bad.

964
01:07:13,858 --> 01:07:18,454
No, that's good. You see,
he can't bounce anybody up there.

965
01:07:18,529 --> 01:07:21,794
Oh, dear. We'll just have
to get him down somehow.

966
01:07:21,866 --> 01:07:24,630
Down? Down?
Do we have to?

967
01:07:24,702 --> 01:07:28,468
Come on, everyone.
Let's hold the corner of my coat.

968
01:07:28,539 --> 01:07:30,905
You're first, Roo. Jump!

969
01:07:30,975 --> 01:07:33,205
Try not to fall too fast, dear.

970
01:07:33,277 --> 01:07:35,939
Whee!

971
01:07:36,013 --> 01:07:41,110
- Oh, thank goodness.
- Gee, that was fun!

972
01:07:41,185 --> 01:07:44,882
Come on, Tigger.
It doesn't hurt. Jump!

973
01:07:44,955 --> 01:07:49,983
- You're next, Tigger. Jump!
- Jump?

974
01:07:50,061 --> 01:07:53,155
Tiggers don't jump.
They bounce.

975
01:07:53,230 --> 01:07:55,164
Then bounce down.

976
01:07:55,232 --> 01:07:58,827
Don't be "ridiccorous."
Tiggers only bounce up!

977
01:07:58,903 --> 01:08:00,837
You can climb down, Tigger.

978
01:08:00,905 --> 01:08:06,400
Ah, but tiggers can't climb down, uh,
because, uh, their tails get in the way.

979
01:08:06,477 --> 01:08:08,468
Hooray! That settles it.

980
01:08:08,546 --> 01:08:10,912
If he won't jump
and he can't climb down...

981
01:08:10,981 --> 01:08:13,677
then we'll just have to
leave him up there forever!

982
01:08:13,751 --> 01:08:17,448
Forever?
Oh, if I ever get out of this...

983
01:08:17,521 --> 01:08:20,820
I promise never
to bounce again, never!

984
01:08:20,891 --> 01:08:25,328
I heard that, Tigger. He promised!
Did you hear him promise?

985
01:08:25,396 --> 01:08:29,423
I heard him. I heard him!
You heard him, didn't you? Didn't you?

986
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:34,130
Well, Tigger, your bouncing
really got you into trouble this time.

987
01:08:34,205 --> 01:08:36,298
Say, who are you?

988
01:08:36,373 --> 01:08:38,364
I'm the narrator.

989
01:08:38,442 --> 01:08:41,934
Oh, well, please, for goodness' sakes,
narrate me down from here.

990
01:08:42,012 --> 01:08:45,209
Very well. Hold on tight.

991
01:08:48,419 --> 01:08:50,614
You can let go now, Tigger.

992
01:08:50,688 --> 01:08:53,885
N-N-Never.

993
01:08:53,958 --> 01:08:58,292
But, Tigger, look for yourself.
You're perfectly safe.

994
01:09:04,034 --> 01:09:06,502
What did I tell you, Tigger?

995
01:09:06,570 --> 01:09:09,471
Come on. Back we go.

996
01:09:12,943 --> 01:09:16,071
Oh! Good old terra firma.

997
01:09:17,782 --> 01:09:20,751
Say, I'm so happy,
I feel like bouncing.

998
01:09:20,818 --> 01:09:23,184
Uh-uh-uh!
You promised. You promised.

999
01:09:23,254 --> 01:09:26,690
Oh. Oh, I did, didn't I?

1000
01:09:26,757 --> 01:09:30,193
You mean, I can't ever bounce again?

1001
01:09:30,261 --> 01:09:33,389
- Never!
- Never?

1002
01:09:38,235 --> 01:09:43,036
Not even just one
teensy, weensy bounce?

1003
01:09:43,107 --> 01:09:45,735
Not even a smidgen of a bounce.

1004
01:10:01,859 --> 01:10:06,353
Oh, the poor dear.
Oh, that's too bad.

1005
01:10:10,768 --> 01:10:15,705
Christopher Robin,
I like the old bouncy Tigger best.

1006
01:10:18,442 --> 01:10:23,072
- So do I, Roo.
- I do too.
- Me too!

1007
01:10:23,147 --> 01:10:27,607
Of course, we all do.
Don't you agree, Rabbit?

1008
01:10:29,820 --> 01:10:32,254
- L-l...
- Well, Rabbit?

1009
01:10:32,323 --> 01:10:34,814
Well, I, uh...

1010
01:10:34,892 --> 01:10:37,884
That is, uh...
Uh, what I mean...

1011
01:10:37,962 --> 01:10:42,228
- Well?
- Well, I, ah...

1012
01:10:42,299 --> 01:10:44,392
Oh, all right.

1013
01:10:44,468 --> 01:10:48,598
I guess I like
the old Tigger better too.

1014
01:10:48,672 --> 01:10:53,268
Oh, boy! You mean,
I can have my bounce back?

1015
01:10:53,344 --> 01:10:55,574
Come on, Rabbit.
Let's you and me bounce.

1016
01:10:55,646 --> 01:10:57,978
Good heavens! Me bounce?

1017
01:10:58,048 --> 01:11:00,812
Why, certainly!
Look, you've got the feet for it.

1018
01:11:00,885 --> 01:11:04,685
- I have?
- Sure. Come on, try it.

1019
01:11:04,755 --> 01:11:07,417
It makes you feel just g-g-great!

1020
01:11:07,491 --> 01:11:10,688
- Well, say, it does, doesn't it?
- Yes, it does.

1021
01:11:10,761 --> 01:11:15,664
- Well, come on, everybody, bounce!
- Come on, bounce.

1022
01:11:15,733 --> 01:11:19,499
<i>The wonderful thing about tiggers</i>
<i>is tiggers are wonderful things</i>

1023
01:11:19,570 --> 01:11:22,095
<i>Their tops are made out of rubber</i>
<i>Their bottoms are made out of springs</i>

1024
01:11:22,172 --> 01:11:24,834
<i>They're bouncy, trouncy, flouncy</i>
<i>pouncy fun, fun, fun, fun, fun</i>

1025
01:11:24,909 --> 01:11:27,343
<i>But the most wonderful thing</i>
<i>about tiggers is I'm the only one</i>

1026
01:11:27,411 --> 01:11:29,606
<i>I'm the only one</i>

1027
01:11:36,020 --> 01:11:38,818
And so, we come to the last chapter...

1028
01:11:38,889 --> 01:11:43,349
in which Christopher Robin and Pooh
come to the enchanted place...

1029
01:11:43,427 --> 01:11:45,861
- and we say good-bye.
- Good-bye?

1030
01:11:45,930 --> 01:11:49,730
Oh, no, please, can't we go back
to page one and do it all over again?

1031
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:54,066
Sorry, Pooh, but all stories
have an ending, you know.

1032
01:11:54,138 --> 01:11:56,163
Oh, bother.

1033
01:11:56,240 --> 01:11:58,800
Yes, the time had come at last.

1034
01:11:58,876 --> 01:12:01,868
Christopher Robin
was going away to school.

1035
01:12:01,946 --> 01:12:06,383
Nobody else in the forest knew
exactly why or where he was going.

1036
01:12:06,450 --> 01:12:11,012
All they knew was it had something
to do with "twice times"...

1037
01:12:11,088 --> 01:12:14,421
and how to make things
called "A-B-C's"...

1038
01:12:14,491 --> 01:12:18,723
and where a place called Brazil is.

1039
01:12:20,097 --> 01:12:22,088
- Pooh?
- Huh?

1040
01:12:22,166 --> 01:12:25,602
What do you like doing
best in the world?

1041
01:12:25,669 --> 01:12:28,604
What I like best
is me going to visit you...

1042
01:12:28,672 --> 01:12:33,575
and you saying,
"How about a smackerel of honey?"

1043
01:12:33,644 --> 01:12:36,112
I like that too.

1044
01:12:36,180 --> 01:12:39,581
But what I like best
is just doing nothing.

1045
01:12:39,650 --> 01:12:43,211
- How do you do "just nothing"?
- Well...

1046
01:12:43,287 --> 01:12:46,552
it's when grown-ups ask,
"What are you going to do?"

1047
01:12:46,623 --> 01:12:50,423
And you say, "nothing."
Then you go out and do it.

1048
01:12:50,494 --> 01:12:52,894
I like that.
Let's do it all the time.

1049
01:12:52,963 --> 01:12:55,932
You know something, Pooh...

1050
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,696
I'm not going to do
just nothing anymore.

1051
01:12:58,769 --> 01:13:00,760
You mean, never again?

1052
01:13:00,838 --> 01:13:03,363
Well, not so much.

1053
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:05,431
Pooh...

1054
01:13:05,509 --> 01:13:08,034
when I'm away
just doing nothing...

1055
01:13:08,112 --> 01:13:10,103
will you come up here sometimes?

1056
01:13:10,180 --> 01:13:12,774
You mean, alone?

1057
01:13:12,850 --> 01:13:15,284
- Just me?
- Yes.

1058
01:13:15,352 --> 01:13:18,879
And, Pooh, promise
you won't forget me...

1059
01:13:18,956 --> 01:13:21,948
- ever?
- Oh, I won't, Christopher, I promise.

1060
01:13:22,026 --> 01:13:24,221
Not even when I'm a hundred?

1061
01:13:24,294 --> 01:13:26,558
How old shall I be then?

1062
01:13:26,630 --> 01:13:28,723
Ninety-nine.

1063
01:13:28,799 --> 01:13:30,926
Silly old bear.

1064
01:13:31,001 --> 01:13:33,265
Wherever they go...

1065
01:13:33,337 --> 01:13:36,306
and whatever happens
to them on the way...

1066
01:13:36,373 --> 01:13:40,070
in that enchanted place
on top of the forest...

1067
01:13:40,144 --> 01:13:42,772
a little bear
will always be waiting.
