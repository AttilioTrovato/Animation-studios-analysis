1
00:01:38,893 --> 00:01:41,676
Edmund! Get away from there!

2
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,485
Peter! What do you think you're doing?

3
00:01:44,494 --> 00:01:46,262
Peter, quickly, the shelter. Now!

4
00:01:46,269 --> 00:01:47,585
- Come on!
- Wait...

5
00:01:47,591 --> 00:01:49,288
Come on, leave it!

6
00:01:51,175 --> 00:01:54,021
Mommy!

7
00:01:55,494 --> 00:01:57,570
Lucy, come on!

8
00:01:59,142 --> 00:02:00,802
- Come on, quickly!
- Run!

9
00:02:01,427 --> 00:02:03,229
Run!

10
00:02:03,714 --> 00:02:06,181
- Hurry!
- Mum!

11
00:02:06,542 --> 00:02:09,079
- Wait! Dad!
- Ed!

12
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,791
- Edmund, no!
- I'll get him!

13
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:15,142
- Peter, come back!
- Ed! Come here!

14
00:02:15,326 --> 00:02:18,168
Edmund! Get down!

15
00:02:18,608 --> 00:02:21,104
Come on, you idiot, run!

16
00:02:21,402 --> 00:02:22,897
Get out!

17
00:02:28,752 --> 00:02:30,591
Come on!

18
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:34,015
Hurry!

19
00:02:35,215 --> 00:02:38,266
Why can't you think of anyone but yourself? You're so selfish!

20
00:02:38,339 --> 00:02:41,459
- You could've got us killed!
- Stop it!

21
00:02:48,653 --> 00:02:51,286
Why can't you just do as you're told?

22
00:03:08,302 --> 00:03:11,882
You need to keep this on, darling. All right?

23
00:03:11,896 --> 00:03:14,190
You warm enough? Good girl.

24
00:03:19,774 --> 00:03:21,921
If Dad were here, he wouldn't make us go.

25
00:03:22,167 --> 00:03:24,785
If Dad were here, it'd mean the war was over and we wouldn't have to.

26
00:03:24,821 --> 00:03:27,489
You will listen to your brother, won't you, Edmund?

27
00:03:42,218 --> 00:03:45,431
Promise me you'll look after the others.

28
00:03:45,467 --> 00:03:47,020
I will, Mum.

29
00:03:49,219 --> 00:03:54,296
- Good man.
- All aboard! All aboard!

30
00:03:57,384 --> 00:04:00,089
Susan.

31
00:04:01,126 --> 00:04:03,700
Be a big girl.

32
00:04:08,252 --> 00:04:11,965
All right. Off you go.

33
00:04:19,938 --> 00:04:24,144
Hey, get off. I know how to get on a train by myself.

34
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,743
Get off me!

35
00:04:27,782 --> 00:04:30,722
May I have your tickets, please? Tickets, please.

36
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:31,601
Peter.

37
00:04:41,352 --> 00:04:44,306
Come on, Lucy. We have to stick together now.

38
00:04:44,831 --> 00:04:49,350
Everything's gonna be all right. It's gonna be fine.

39
00:05:05,609 --> 00:05:09,677
- Bye-bye, dear.
- Bye! We'll miss you! See you soon.

40
00:07:29,811 --> 00:07:31,573
The professor knew we were coming.

41
00:07:33,046 --> 00:07:35,715
Perhaps we've been incorrectly labeled.

42
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:39,343
Come on, hup!

43
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:47,857
And whoa. Whoa.

44
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,035
- Mrs. Macready?
- I'm afraid so.

45
00:07:56,895 --> 00:07:59,978
Is this it, then? Haven't you brought anything else?

46
00:08:00,499 --> 00:08:02,516
No, ma'am.

47
00:08:02,951 --> 00:08:04,540
It's just us.

48
00:08:05,824 --> 00:08:08,742
Small favors.

49
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:14,560
Come on. Good girl. Come on. Come on.

50
00:08:28,332 --> 00:08:32,252
Professor Kirke is not accustomed to havin' children in this house.

51
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:36,720
And, as such, there are a few rules we need to follow.

52
00:08:36,824 --> 00:08:38,679
There will no shoutin'.

53
00:08:38,859 --> 00:08:42,800
Or runnin'. No improper use of the dumbwaiter.

54
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:46,250
No touchin' of the historical artifacts!

55
00:08:49,107 --> 00:08:50,836
And above all,

56
00:08:50,894 --> 00:08:56,435
there shall be no disturbin' of the professor.

57
00:09:17,782 --> 00:09:19,651
The sheets feel scratchy.

58
00:09:21,545 --> 00:09:25,669
Wars don't last forever, Lucy. We'll be home soon.

59
00:09:26,022 --> 00:09:29,703
- Yeah, if home's still there.
- Isn't it time you were in bed?

60
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,442
- Yes, Mum.
- Ed!

61
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,908
You saw outside. This place is huge.

62
00:09:38,627 --> 00:09:40,703
We can do whatever we want here.

63
00:09:41,005 --> 00:09:43,579
Tomorrow's going to be great.

64
00:09:43,728 --> 00:09:45,151
Really.

65
00:09:49,874 --> 00:09:53,801
"Gastrovascular."

66
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:58,635
Come on, Peter. Gastrovascular.

67
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,931
- Is it Latin?
- Yes.

68
00:10:02,181 --> 00:10:05,361
Is it Latin for "worst game ever invented"?

69
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,260
We could play hide and seek.

70
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:14,947
But we're already having so much fun.

71
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,937
Come on, Peter, please.

72
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,058
Pretty please?

73
00:10:21,448 --> 00:10:25,745
- One, two, three, four...
- What?

74
00:10:26,352 --> 00:10:29,269
...five, six, seven, eight,

75
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:34,769
nine, ten, eleven...

76
00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:49,687
...24, 25, 26...

77
00:11:05,469 --> 00:11:06,750
I was here first!

78
00:15:23,844 --> 00:15:26,311
Were you hiding from me?

79
00:15:30,865 --> 00:15:32,394
No.

80
00:15:33,031 --> 00:15:35,048
Uh, well...

81
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,345
I just... I...

82
00:15:37,627 --> 00:15:39,806
No. No. I-I-I just...

83
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:42,460
I was just, um... I didn't want to scare you.

84
00:15:45,439 --> 00:15:50,412
If you don't mind my asking... what are you?

85
00:15:50,693 --> 00:15:53,933
Well, I'm a... Well, I'm a faun.

86
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:55,356
And what about you?

87
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:58,660
You must be some kind of beardless dwarf?

88
00:15:58,696 --> 00:16:03,434
I'm not a dwarf! I'm a girl!

89
00:16:03,471 --> 00:16:08,025
And, actually, I'm tallest in my class.

90
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:14,573
You mean to say that you're a Daughter of Eve?

91
00:16:14,747 --> 00:16:16,698
Well, my mum's name is Helen.

92
00:16:16,735 --> 00:16:21,669
Yes, but you are in fact human.

93
00:16:22,146 --> 00:16:25,136
Yes, of course.

94
00:16:26,578 --> 00:16:28,274
What are you doing here?

95
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:31,812
Well, I was hiding in the wardrobe in the spare room, and...

96
00:16:31,848 --> 00:16:33,994
Spare Oom? Is that in Narnia?

97
00:16:34,176 --> 00:16:36,714
Narnia? What's that?

98
00:16:37,344 --> 00:16:39,977
Well, dear girl, you're in it.

99
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,767
Everything from the lamppost

100
00:16:42,886 --> 00:16:46,469
all the way to Castle Cair Paravel on the Eastern Ocean,

101
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,763
every stick and stone you see,

102
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:52,511
every icicle is Narnia.

103
00:16:54,141 --> 00:16:57,747
This is an awfully big wardrobe.

104
00:16:57,837 --> 00:17:00,719
War Drobe? I'm sorry.

105
00:17:00,738 --> 00:17:04,298
Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Tumnus.

106
00:17:04,334 --> 00:17:08,402
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Tumnus. I'm Lucy Pevensie.

107
00:17:12,278 --> 00:17:16,176
- Oh, you shake it.
- Uh... Why?

108
00:17:17,178 --> 00:17:19,774
I... I don't know.

109
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,447
People do it when they meet each other.

110
00:17:31,414 --> 00:17:36,749
Well, then, Lucy Pevensie from the shining city of War Drobe

111
00:17:36,785 --> 00:17:39,773
in the wondrous land of Spare Oom,

112
00:17:39,923 --> 00:17:44,585
how would it be if you came and had tea with me?

113
00:17:44,622 --> 00:17:47,047
Well, thank you very much, but I...

114
00:17:48,229 --> 00:17:50,625
I probably should be getting back.

115
00:17:50,852 --> 00:17:55,077
It's only just around the corner. And there'll be a glorious fire

116
00:17:55,114 --> 00:17:58,683
with toast and tea and cakes.

117
00:17:59,361 --> 00:18:03,000
And, perhaps, we'll even break into the sardines.

118
00:18:03,923 --> 00:18:06,425
- I don't know.
- Come on.

119
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:09,224
It's not every day that I get to make a new friend.

120
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:14,108
Well, I suppose I could come for a little while.

121
00:18:15,437 --> 00:18:16,860
If you have sardines.

122
00:18:18,212 --> 00:18:20,015
By the bucketload.

123
00:18:31,441 --> 00:18:33,943
- You all right?
- Mm-hm.

124
00:18:41,542 --> 00:18:43,096
Well, here we are.

125
00:18:43,398 --> 00:18:45,687
Come along.

126
00:18:52,206 --> 00:18:54,297
- After you.
- May I help you with that?

127
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:57,179
- Thank you very much.
- Oh.

128
00:19:13,597 --> 00:19:15,886
Now, that... that is my father.

129
00:19:17,554 --> 00:19:19,772
He has a nice face.

130
00:19:19,899 --> 00:19:21,429
He looks a lot like you.

131
00:19:22,867 --> 00:19:24,635
No.

132
00:19:24,807 --> 00:19:27,832
No, I'm not very much like him at all, really.

133
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:31,412
My father's fighting in the war.

134
00:19:32,954 --> 00:19:36,323
My father went away to war too.

135
00:19:37,466 --> 00:19:40,692
But that was a long, long time ago.

136
00:19:40,882 --> 00:19:44,953
- Before this dreadful winter.
- Winter's not all bad.

137
00:19:44,989 --> 00:19:49,639
There's ice skating and snowball fights.

138
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:53,186
- Oh! And Christmas!
- Not here.

139
00:19:53,222 --> 00:19:58,334
No. No, we haven't had a Christmas in a hundred years.

140
00:19:58,687 --> 00:20:02,577
What? No presents for a hundred years?

141
00:20:02,654 --> 00:20:04,880
Always winter, never Christmas.

142
00:20:04,886 --> 00:20:07,875
It's been a long winter.

143
00:20:08,865 --> 00:20:12,470
But you would have loved Narnia in summer.

144
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:16,568
We fauns danced with the dryads all night,

145
00:20:16,605 --> 00:20:20,303
and, you know, we never got tired.

146
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:25,451
And music. Oh, such music!

147
00:20:25,885 --> 00:20:29,431
Would... would you like to hear some now?

148
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:33,284
Oh! Yes, please.

149
00:20:37,294 --> 00:20:40,602
Now, are you familiar

150
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:44,481
- with any Narnian lullabies?
- Sorry, no.

151
00:20:44,517 --> 00:20:46,699
Well, that's good.

152
00:20:47,093 --> 00:20:52,241
Because this... probably won't sound anything like one.

153
00:22:16,647 --> 00:22:19,316
- Oh, I should go.
- It's too late for that now.

154
00:22:21,503 --> 00:22:24,041
I'm such a terrible faun.

155
00:22:26,921 --> 00:22:29,317
Oh, no.

156
00:22:29,629 --> 00:22:32,476
You're the nicest faun I've ever met.

157
00:22:32,538 --> 00:22:36,251
Then I'm afraid you've had a very poor sampling.

158
00:22:37,095 --> 00:22:41,781
You can't have done anything that bad.

159
00:22:42,406 --> 00:22:46,700
It's not something I have done, Lucy Pevensie.

160
00:22:47,301 --> 00:22:49,483
It's something I am doing.

161
00:22:49,529 --> 00:22:51,296
What are you doing?

162
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:55,459
I'm kidnapping you.

163
00:22:55,605 --> 00:22:56,756
It was the White Witch.

164
00:22:57,002 --> 00:22:59,849
She's the one who makes it always winter, always cold.

165
00:23:00,055 --> 00:23:01,644
She gave orders.

166
00:23:01,655 --> 00:23:04,722
If any of us ever find a human wandering in the woods,

167
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:07,153
we're supposed to turn it over to her.

168
00:23:08,514 --> 00:23:11,504
But, Mr. Tumnus, you wouldn't.

169
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:19,505
I thought you were my friend.

170
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:26,421
Now. She may already know you're here.

171
00:23:26,458 --> 00:23:29,197
The woods are full of her spies.

172
00:23:31,934 --> 00:23:34,994
Even some of the trees are on her side.

173
00:23:38,677 --> 00:23:41,417
Can you find your way back from here?

174
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:44,860
- I think so.
- All right.

175
00:23:47,913 --> 00:23:51,875
Will you be all right?

176
00:23:55,957 --> 00:23:58,878
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

177
00:24:01,894 --> 00:24:03,732
Here.

178
00:24:05,223 --> 00:24:09,422
Keep it. You need it more than I do.

179
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:15,116
No matter what happens, Lucy Pevensie,

180
00:24:15,215 --> 00:24:17,753
I am glad to have met you.

181
00:24:18,272 --> 00:24:21,463
You've made me feel warmer than I've felt in a hundred years.

182
00:24:22,513 --> 00:24:24,066
Now go.

183
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,052
Go!

184
00:24:40,013 --> 00:24:43,382
It's all right! I'm back! I'm all right!

185
00:24:43,804 --> 00:24:46,271
Shut up! He's coming!

186
00:24:49,542 --> 00:24:53,088
You know, I'm not sure you two have quite got the idea of this game.

187
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:55,917
Weren't you wondering where I was?

188
00:24:56,031 --> 00:24:58,909
That's the point. That was why he was seeking you.

189
00:24:58,946 --> 00:25:00,297
Does this mean I win?

190
00:25:00,327 --> 00:25:02,195
I don't think Lucy wants to play anymore.

191
00:25:02,231 --> 00:25:04,768
I've been gone for hours.

192
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:22,418
Lucy, the only wood in here is the back of the wardrobe.

193
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:26,759
One game at a time, Lu. We don't all have your imagination.

194
00:25:30,703 --> 00:25:33,929
But I wasn't imagining!

195
00:25:34,006 --> 00:25:35,773
That's enough, Lucy.

196
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:38,603
I wouldn't lie about this!

197
00:25:38,749 --> 00:25:40,517
Well, I believe you.

198
00:25:40,584 --> 00:25:43,158
- You do?
- Yeah, of course.

199
00:25:43,514 --> 00:25:46,147
Didn't I tell you about the field in the cupboards?

200
00:25:46,363 --> 00:25:48,581
Will you just stop?

201
00:25:48,876 --> 00:25:50,786
You just have to make everything worse, don't you?

202
00:25:50,823 --> 00:25:53,811
- It was just a joke!
- When are you gonna learn to grow up?

203
00:25:53,918 --> 00:25:57,323
Shut up! You think you're Dad, but you're not!

204
00:26:01,001 --> 00:26:03,599
Well, that was nicely handled.

205
00:26:05,801 --> 00:26:10,249
But... it really was there.

206
00:26:10,612 --> 00:26:13,118
Susan's right, Lucy.

207
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:15,100
That's enough.

208
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,244
Lucy.

209
00:27:53,122 --> 00:27:55,269
Where are you?

210
00:27:57,487 --> 00:27:59,111
Boo!

211
00:28:05,723 --> 00:28:07,775
Lucy.

212
00:28:09,613 --> 00:28:12,116
Hope you're not afraid of the dark.

213
00:28:18,205 --> 00:28:19,901
Lucy?

214
00:28:25,628 --> 00:28:27,537
Lucy?

215
00:28:28,492 --> 00:28:30,117
Lucy!

216
00:28:48,836 --> 00:28:50,745
Lucy.

217
00:28:51,612 --> 00:28:53,593
Where are you?

218
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,127
Lucy.

219
00:28:58,073 --> 00:29:00,576
I think I believe you now.

220
00:29:26,534 --> 00:29:28,231
Lucy.

221
00:29:44,685 --> 00:29:45,930
Lucy?

222
00:30:15,506 --> 00:30:18,175
- Leave me alone!
- What is it now, Ginarrbrik?

223
00:30:18,248 --> 00:30:20,573
Make him let me go! I didn't do anything wrong!

224
00:30:20,687 --> 00:30:23,154
How dare you address the Queen of Narnia?

225
00:30:23,389 --> 00:30:24,493
I didn't know!

226
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:27,649
- You will know her better hereafter!
- Wait!

227
00:30:38,422 --> 00:30:41,612
What is your name, Son of Adam?

228
00:30:42,088 --> 00:30:44,413
Uh, Edmund.

229
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:48,049
And how, Edmund, did you come to enter my dominion?

230
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:52,434
I'm not sure. I was just following my sister.

231
00:30:52,742 --> 00:30:56,509
- Your sister? How many are you?
- Four.

232
00:30:56,659 --> 00:30:58,880
Lucy's the only one that's been here before.

233
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:03,439
She said she met some faun called Tumnus.

234
00:31:03,562 --> 00:31:06,143
Peter and Susan didn't believe her. I didn't either.

235
00:31:06,334 --> 00:31:11,197
Edmund, you look so cold. Will you come and sit with me?

236
00:31:26,693 --> 00:31:29,718
Now, how about something hot to drink?

237
00:31:30,663 --> 00:31:34,447
Yes, please, Your Majesty.

238
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:54,435
Your drink, sire.

239
00:31:54,682 --> 00:31:56,648
How did you do that?

240
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,952
I can make anything you like.

241
00:31:59,889 --> 00:32:02,487
Can you make me taller?

242
00:32:03,123 --> 00:32:06,242
Anything you'd like to eat.

243
00:32:06,634 --> 00:32:08,923
Turkish delight?

244
00:32:34,688 --> 00:32:36,497
Edmund?

245
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:39,396
I would very much like to meet the rest of your family.

246
00:32:39,796 --> 00:32:41,449
Why?

247
00:32:42,111 --> 00:32:44,578
They're nothing special.

248
00:32:45,367 --> 00:32:51,583
Oh, I'm sure they're not nearly as delightful as you are.

249
00:32:51,815 --> 00:32:56,014
But you see, Edmund, I have no children of my own.

250
00:32:56,381 --> 00:32:58,398
And you are exactly the sort of boy

251
00:32:58,479 --> 00:33:04,008
who I could see, one day, becoming Prince of Narnia.

252
00:33:04,152 --> 00:33:06,513
Maybe even King.

253
00:33:07,196 --> 00:33:09,213
Really?

254
00:33:09,972 --> 00:33:12,569
Of course, you'd have to bring your family.

255
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:13,463
Oh.

256
00:33:14,196 --> 00:33:17,773
Do you mean, Peter would be king too?

257
00:33:17,931 --> 00:33:20,558
No! No, no.

258
00:33:21,193 --> 00:33:24,348
But a king needs servants.

259
00:33:25,632 --> 00:33:28,170
I guess I could bring 'em.

260
00:33:32,052 --> 00:33:35,264
Beyond these woods, you see those two hills?

261
00:33:35,301 --> 00:33:38,526
My house is right between them.

262
00:33:38,637 --> 00:33:40,359
You'd love it there, Edmund.

263
00:33:40,783 --> 00:33:45,055
It has whole rooms simply stuffed with Turkish delight.

264
00:33:45,624 --> 00:33:48,993
- Couldn't I have some more now?
- No!

265
00:33:50,736 --> 00:33:53,132
Don't want to ruin your appetite.

266
00:33:53,454 --> 00:33:57,338
Besides, you and I are going to be seeing each other again very soon.

267
00:33:57,375 --> 00:34:00,257
I hope so, Your Majesty.

268
00:34:00,694 --> 00:34:05,285
Until then, dear one. Mmm, I'm gonna miss you.

269
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,902
Edmund?

270
00:34:21,227 --> 00:34:24,109
Oh, Edmund! You got in too!

271
00:34:24,224 --> 00:34:25,108
Isn't it wonderful?

272
00:34:26,338 --> 00:34:30,716
- Where have you been?
- With Mr. Tumnus. He's fine.

273
00:34:31,036 --> 00:34:35,033
The White Witch hasn't found out anything about him meeting me.

274
00:34:35,167 --> 00:34:36,347
The White Witch?

275
00:34:37,538 --> 00:34:41,607
She calls herself the Queen of Narnia, but she really isn't.

276
00:34:42,382 --> 00:34:45,644
Are you all right? You look awful.

277
00:34:45,724 --> 00:34:49,568
Well, what'd you expect? I mean, it's freezing.

278
00:34:50,072 --> 00:34:52,799
- How do we get out of here?
- Come on.

279
00:34:53,531 --> 00:34:55,191
This way.

280
00:34:57,884 --> 00:35:00,434
Peter, Peter, wake up! Peter, wake up!

281
00:35:00,471 --> 00:35:02,409
- It's there! It's really there!
- Shh.

282
00:35:02,409 --> 00:35:04,872
- Lucy, what are you talking about?
- Narnia!

283
00:35:04,909 --> 00:35:07,215
It's all in the wardrobe like I told you!

284
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,080
- You've just been dreaming, Lucy.
- But I haven't!

285
00:35:10,394 --> 00:35:14,681
I saw Mr. Tumnus again! And this time Edmund went too.

286
00:35:17,219 --> 00:35:20,623
You... You saw the faun?

287
00:35:23,754 --> 00:35:27,644
Well, he didn't actually go there with me.

288
00:35:28,834 --> 00:35:31,539
He...

289
00:35:33,961 --> 00:35:36,073
What were you doing, Edmund?

290
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,462
I was just playing along.

291
00:35:41,355 --> 00:35:42,884
I'm sorry, Peter.

292
00:35:43,032 --> 00:35:45,113
I shouldn't have encouraged her,

293
00:35:45,149 --> 00:35:48,137
but you know what little children are like these days.

294
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:52,862
They just don't know when to stop pretending.

295
00:36:09,752 --> 00:36:13,536
You children are one shenanigan shy of sleepin' in the stable!

296
00:36:14,869 --> 00:36:21,091
Professor. I'm sorry. I told them you were not to be disturbed.

297
00:36:21,127 --> 00:36:23,641
It's all right, Mrs. Macready. I'm sure there's an explanation.

298
00:36:25,838 --> 00:36:29,361
But first of all, I think this one is in need of a little hot chocolate.

299
00:36:29,442 --> 00:36:30,389
Come along, dear.

300
00:36:39,368 --> 00:36:43,865
You seem to have upset the delicate internal balance of my housekeeper.

301
00:36:44,267 --> 00:36:46,792
We're very sorry, sir. It won't happen again.

302
00:36:47,316 --> 00:36:49,893
It's our sister, sir. Lucy.

303
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:52,144
- The weeping girl.
- Yes, sir.

304
00:36:52,503 --> 00:36:55,280
- She's upset.
- Hence the weeping.

305
00:36:55,628 --> 00:36:56,899
It's nothing.

306
00:36:57,546 --> 00:36:59,774
- We can handle it.
- Oh, I can see that.

307
00:37:02,335 --> 00:37:04,098
She thinks she's found a magical land.

308
00:37:04,588 --> 00:37:06,849
In the upstairs wardrobe.

309
00:37:09,759 --> 00:37:11,527
What did you say?

310
00:37:12,391 --> 00:37:15,043
Um, the wardrobe, upstairs.

311
00:37:15,672 --> 00:37:18,210
Lucy thinks she's found a forest inside.

312
00:37:18,267 --> 00:37:20,781
She won't stop going on about it.

313
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,946
- What was it like?
- Like talking to a lunatic.

314
00:37:25,356 --> 00:37:27,270
No, no, no, not her. The forest.

315
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:30,735
- You're not saying you believe her?
- You don't?

316
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:32,696
But of course not.

317
00:37:32,807 --> 00:37:34,768
I mean, logically, it's impossible.

318
00:37:35,539 --> 00:37:37,645
What do they teach in schools these days?

319
00:37:38,429 --> 00:37:40,246
Edmund said they were only pretending.

320
00:37:40,552 --> 00:37:42,557
He's usually the more truthful one, is he?

321
00:37:42,735 --> 00:37:46,035
No. This would be the first time.

322
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:47,906
Well, if she's not mad and she's not lying,

323
00:37:48,107 --> 00:37:52,588
then logically we must assume she's telling the truth.

324
00:37:53,279 --> 00:37:56,547
You're saying that we should just believe her?

325
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:01,976
She's your sister, isn't she? You're her family.

326
00:38:04,325 --> 00:38:06,760
You might just try acting like one.

327
00:38:07,899 --> 00:38:12,491
Peter winds up, poised to take yet another wicket!

328
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:16,950
Whoops! Wake up, Dolly Daydream.

329
00:38:18,385 --> 00:38:20,839
Why can't we play hide and seek again?

330
00:38:21,365 --> 00:38:23,150
I thought you said it was a kid's game.

331
00:38:23,786 --> 00:38:27,777
Besides, we could all use the fresh air.

332
00:38:27,836 --> 00:38:30,253
It's not like there isn't air inside.

333
00:38:31,128 --> 00:38:33,582
- Are you ready?
- Are you?

334
00:38:51,939 --> 00:38:54,352
- Well done, Ed.
- You bowled it!

335
00:38:54,552 --> 00:38:56,781
- What on earth is goin' on?
- The Macready!

336
00:38:56,818 --> 00:38:57,999
Come on!

337
00:39:06,442 --> 00:39:08,015
No, no, back, back, back!

338
00:39:34,112 --> 00:39:37,810
- Come on!
- Oh, you've got to be joking.

339
00:39:50,529 --> 00:39:51,545
Get back!

340
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,538
- My toe!
- I'm not on your toe!

341
00:39:54,687 --> 00:39:57,494
- Move back.
- Will you stop shoving?

342
00:40:11,303 --> 00:40:13,273
lmpossible.

343
00:40:14,447 --> 00:40:15,762
Don't worry.

344
00:40:16,246 --> 00:40:18,994
I'm sure it's just your imagination.

345
00:40:20,136 --> 00:40:22,952
I don't suppose saying we're sorry

346
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:26,294
- would quite cover it.
- No. It wouldn't.

347
00:40:27,413 --> 00:40:30,318
- But that might!
- Oh!

348
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,707
Ow!

349
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,919
Stop it!

350
00:40:44,423 --> 00:40:45,936
You little liar.

351
00:40:45,966 --> 00:40:49,759
- You didn't believe her, either.
- Apologize to Lucy.

352
00:40:51,701 --> 00:40:55,880
- Say you're sorry.
- All right! I'm sorry.

353
00:40:55,982 --> 00:40:57,025
That's all right.

354
00:40:57,925 --> 00:41:00,747
Some children just don't know when to stop pretending.

355
00:41:01,016 --> 00:41:02,496
Oh, very funny.

356
00:41:02,551 --> 00:41:03,790
Maybe we should go back.

357
00:41:04,415 --> 00:41:06,592
But shouldn't we at least take a look around?

358
00:41:07,412 --> 00:41:09,865
I think Lucy should decide.

359
00:41:10,963 --> 00:41:13,643
I'd like you all to meet Mr. Tumnus!

360
00:41:14,469 --> 00:41:16,517
Well, then Mr. Tumnus it is.

361
00:41:17,836 --> 00:41:20,744
But we can't go hiking in the snow dressed like this.

362
00:41:21,492 --> 00:41:22,390
No.

363
00:41:24,074 --> 00:41:27,404
But I'm sure the professor wouldn't mind us using these.

364
00:41:27,622 --> 00:41:31,313
Anyway, if you think about it logically,

365
00:41:32,427 --> 00:41:34,466
we're not even taking them out of the wardrobe.

366
00:41:34,674 --> 00:41:37,485
- But that's a girl's coat!
- I know.

367
00:42:22,135 --> 00:42:25,684
...lots and lots of lovely food, and we'll have lots and lots of...

368
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:30,453
Lu?

369
00:42:32,123 --> 00:42:33,411
Lucy!

370
00:42:51,196 --> 00:42:53,940
Who would do something like this?

371
00:43:11,974 --> 00:43:15,009
"The Faun Tumnus is hereby charged

372
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:19,130
with High Treason against Her lmperial Majesty,

373
00:43:19,353 --> 00:43:22,069
Jadis, Queen of Narnia,

374
00:43:22,288 --> 00:43:25,744
for comforting her enemies and fraternizing with humans.

375
00:43:26,026 --> 00:43:28,888
Signed Maugrim, Captain of the Secret Police.

376
00:43:29,604 --> 00:43:31,935
Long Live the Queen."

377
00:43:32,545 --> 00:43:36,246
All right. Now we really should go back.

378
00:43:36,426 --> 00:43:38,191
But what about Mr. Tumnus?

379
00:43:38,395 --> 00:43:40,223
If he was arrested just for being with a human,

380
00:43:41,116 --> 00:43:44,669
- I don't think there's much we can do.
- You don't understand, do you?

381
00:43:45,693 --> 00:43:47,415
I'm the human.

382
00:43:48,341 --> 00:43:50,789
She must have found out he helped me.

383
00:43:50,839 --> 00:43:54,021
- Maybe we could call the police.
- These are the police.

384
00:43:54,359 --> 00:43:56,662
Don't worry, Lu. We'll think of something.

385
00:43:56,983 --> 00:43:58,201
Why?

386
00:43:58,689 --> 00:44:00,765
I mean, he's a criminal.

387
00:44:05,959 --> 00:44:09,012
Did that bird just "psst" us?

388
00:44:52,073 --> 00:44:54,530
It... It's a beaver.

389
00:45:00,956 --> 00:45:02,295
Here, boy.

390
00:45:02,511 --> 00:45:04,234
Here, boy.

391
00:45:08,713 --> 00:45:11,690
I ain't gonna smell it, if that's what you want.

392
00:45:13,471 --> 00:45:14,588
Sorry.

393
00:45:15,577 --> 00:45:17,295
Lucy Pevensie?

394
00:45:19,655 --> 00:45:23,585
Yes?

395
00:45:33,148 --> 00:45:35,106
Hey, that's the hankie I gave to Mr. Tum...

396
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:38,336
Tumnus. He got it to me just before they took him.

397
00:45:38,483 --> 00:45:39,520
Is he all right?

398
00:45:41,417 --> 00:45:43,313
Further in.

399
00:45:45,272 --> 00:45:47,657
- What are you doing?
- She's right.

400
00:45:48,032 --> 00:45:49,866
How do we know we can trust him?

401
00:45:50,927 --> 00:45:52,431
He said he knows the faun.

402
00:45:52,622 --> 00:45:56,650
He's a beaver. He shouldn't be saying anything!

403
00:45:57,019 --> 00:45:58,013
Everything all right?

404
00:45:58,328 --> 00:46:00,699
Yes. We were just talking.

405
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:03,736
That's better left for safer quarters.

406
00:46:04,474 --> 00:46:06,885
He means the trees.

407
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:25,046
Come on. We don't want to be caught out here after nightfall.

408
00:46:39,439 --> 00:46:42,493
Ah, blimey! Looks like the old girl has got the kettle on.

409
00:46:42,671 --> 00:46:43,893
Nice cup o' Rosy Lee.

410
00:46:44,674 --> 00:46:46,634
- It's lovely.
- It's merely a trifle.

411
00:46:46,909 --> 00:46:49,464
Still plenty to do. Ain't quite finished it yet.

412
00:46:49,467 --> 00:46:51,242
It'll look the business when it is, though.

413
00:46:52,945 --> 00:46:56,222
Beaver, is that you? I've been worried sick!

414
00:46:56,669 --> 00:46:59,344
If I find you've been out with Badger again, I...

415
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:01,060
Oh!

416
00:47:01,363 --> 00:47:03,308
Well, those aren't badgers.

417
00:47:03,676 --> 00:47:08,034
Oh, I never thought I'd live to see this day.

418
00:47:09,095 --> 00:47:12,396
Look at my fur. You couldn't give me ten minutes warning?

419
00:47:12,642 --> 00:47:14,980
I'd have given a week if I thought it would've helped.

420
00:47:16,211 --> 00:47:17,902
Oh, come inside,

421
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:19,459
and we'll see if we can't get you some food,

422
00:47:19,808 --> 00:47:22,449
and some civilized company.

423
00:47:24,195 --> 00:47:26,050
Now, careful. Watch your step.

424
00:47:26,465 --> 00:47:27,432
Excuse the mess.

425
00:47:27,812 --> 00:47:30,565
Can't get Mr. Beaver to get out of his chair.

426
00:47:35,593 --> 00:47:37,617
Enjoyin' the scenery, are we?

427
00:47:42,083 --> 00:47:44,658
Isn't there anything we can do to help Tumnus?

428
00:47:45,016 --> 00:47:47,894
They'll have taken him to the Witch's. You know what they say.

429
00:47:48,082 --> 00:47:51,533
There's few that go through them gates that come out again.

430
00:47:52,101 --> 00:47:52,916
Fish 'n' chips?

431
00:47:54,797 --> 00:47:58,807
But there is hope, dear. Lots of hope.

432
00:47:59,275 --> 00:48:01,242
Oh, yeah, there's a right bit more than hope!

433
00:48:03,085 --> 00:48:05,690
Aslan is on the move.

434
00:48:12,765 --> 00:48:14,302
Who's Aslan?

435
00:48:15,084 --> 00:48:17,051
Who's Aslan?

436
00:48:17,717 --> 00:48:19,502
You cheeky little blighter.

437
00:48:21,717 --> 00:48:22,838
What?

438
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:29,057
- You don't know, do you?
- We haven't exactly been here long.

439
00:48:29,106 --> 00:48:31,303
Well, he's only the king of the whole wood.

440
00:48:31,809 --> 00:48:35,319
The top geezer. The real King of Narnia.

441
00:48:35,803 --> 00:48:39,467
- He's been away for a long while.
- But he's just got back!

442
00:48:39,664 --> 00:48:42,111
And he's waitin' for you near the Stone Table!

443
00:48:42,159 --> 00:48:45,055
- He's waiting for us?
- You're bloomin' joking!

444
00:48:45,099 --> 00:48:47,879
They don't even know about the prophecy!

445
00:48:48,005 --> 00:48:51,197
- Well, then...
- Look.

446
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:53,880
Aslan's return,

447
00:48:54,126 --> 00:48:57,213
Tumnus' arrest, the secret police,

448
00:48:57,512 --> 00:48:59,310
it's all happening because of you!

449
00:48:59,792 --> 00:49:02,916
- You're blaming us?
- No! Not blaming.

450
00:49:03,374 --> 00:49:06,799
- Thanking you.
- There's a prophecy.

451
00:49:07,452 --> 00:49:09,684
"When Adam's flesh and Adam's bone

452
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:12,628
sits at Cair Paravel in throne,

453
00:49:13,415 --> 00:49:15,545
the evil time will be over and done."

454
00:49:15,611 --> 00:49:18,294
- That doesn't really rhyme.
- I know it don't.

455
00:49:18,593 --> 00:49:20,200
You're kinda missin' the point!

456
00:49:21,193 --> 00:49:23,303
It has long been foretold

457
00:49:23,606 --> 00:49:26,371
that two Sons of Adam and two Daughters of Eve

458
00:49:26,566 --> 00:49:31,043
will defeat the White Witch and restore peace to Narnia.

459
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:35,247
And you think we're the ones?

460
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,243
You'd better be, 'cause Aslan's already fitted out your army.

461
00:49:38,429 --> 00:49:40,860
- Our army?
- Mum sent us away

462
00:49:41,002 --> 00:49:43,047
so we wouldn't get caught up in a war.

463
00:49:44,467 --> 00:49:45,887
I think you've made a mistake.

464
00:49:46,411 --> 00:49:49,692
- We're not heroes.
- We're from Finchley.

465
00:49:52,161 --> 00:49:54,158
Thank you for your hospitality.

466
00:49:55,851 --> 00:49:59,593
- But we really have to go.
- No, you can't just leave!

467
00:49:59,623 --> 00:50:03,677
He's right. We have to help Mr. Tumnus.

468
00:50:03,867 --> 00:50:04,883
It's out of our hands.

469
00:50:06,125 --> 00:50:07,353
I'm sorry,

470
00:50:07,772 --> 00:50:11,231
but it's time the four of us were getting home. Ed?

471
00:50:13,179 --> 00:50:14,366
Ed?

472
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:20,612
- I'm gonna kill him.
- You may not have to.

473
00:50:20,858 --> 00:50:23,567
Has Edmund ever been to Narnia before?

474
00:50:50,388 --> 00:50:51,129
Hurry!

475
00:51:11,937 --> 00:51:14,968
- Edmund!
- Shh! They'll hear you!

476
00:51:16,123 --> 00:51:17,210
No!

477
00:51:17,246 --> 00:51:19,783
- Get off!
- You're playing into her hands.

478
00:51:19,978 --> 00:51:22,026
- We can't just let him go!
- He's our brother!

479
00:51:22,216 --> 00:51:25,222
He's the bait! The Witch wants all four of you!

480
00:51:25,392 --> 00:51:28,952
- Why?
- To stop the prophecy from coming true.

481
00:51:29,235 --> 00:51:30,887
To kill you!

482
00:51:40,745 --> 00:51:43,868
- This is all your fault.
- My fault?

483
00:51:44,033 --> 00:51:46,001
None of this would have happened if you had listened to me!

484
00:51:46,631 --> 00:51:49,514
- You knew this would happen.
- I didn't know what would happen.

485
00:51:50,061 --> 00:51:52,007
Which is why we should have left while we could!

486
00:51:52,149 --> 00:51:53,180
Stop it!

487
00:51:53,826 --> 00:51:57,716
- This isn't going to help Edmund.
- She's right.

488
00:51:58,405 --> 00:52:01,667
Only Aslan can help your brother now.

489
00:52:02,876 --> 00:52:04,536
Then take us to him.

490
00:53:14,695 --> 00:53:17,815
Be still, stranger, or you'll never move again.

491
00:53:18,585 --> 00:53:20,282
- Who are you?
- I'm Edmund!

492
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:23,130
I met the Queen in the woods! She told me to come back here!

493
00:53:23,518 --> 00:53:25,012
I'm a Son of Adam!

494
00:53:25,306 --> 00:53:30,514
Hmm. My apologies, fortunate favorite of the queen.

495
00:53:30,668 --> 00:53:34,108
Or else, not so fortunate.

496
00:53:38,099 --> 00:53:39,973
Right this way.

497
00:54:00,969 --> 00:54:02,808
Wait here.

498
00:54:42,105 --> 00:54:43,279
Like it?

499
00:54:43,752 --> 00:54:48,864
Uh... Yes, Your Majesty.

500
00:54:50,664 --> 00:54:52,846
I thought you might.

501
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:56,688
Tell me, Edmund...

502
00:54:59,233 --> 00:55:01,344
Are your sisters deaf?

503
00:55:02,148 --> 00:55:02,817
No.

504
00:55:03,196 --> 00:55:06,150
And your brother, is he...

505
00:55:07,956 --> 00:55:09,937
...unintelligent?

506
00:55:10,764 --> 00:55:12,864
Well, I think so. But Mum says...

507
00:55:13,017 --> 00:55:16,474
Then how dare you come alone?!

508
00:55:16,745 --> 00:55:19,513
- I tried!
- Edmund, I asked so little of you.

509
00:55:19,657 --> 00:55:22,397
- They just don't listen to me!
- You couldn't even do that.

510
00:55:22,543 --> 00:55:24,101
I did bring them halfway.

511
00:55:24,103 --> 00:55:26,879
They're at the little house at the dam with the Beavers.

512
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:35,686
Well.

513
00:55:35,705 --> 00:55:39,774
I suppose you're not a total loss then, are you?

514
00:55:42,993 --> 00:55:44,974
Well, I was wondering,

515
00:55:45,450 --> 00:55:50,693
could I maybe have some more Turkish delight now?

516
00:55:55,418 --> 00:55:57,565
Our guest is hungry.

517
00:56:04,823 --> 00:56:08,429
This way for your num-nums.

518
00:56:10,397 --> 00:56:13,457
Maugrim?

519
00:56:15,269 --> 00:56:17,451
You know what to do.

520
00:56:43,961 --> 00:56:44,967
Hurry, Mother! They're after us!

521
00:56:46,279 --> 00:56:49,339
- Oh, right then.
- What's she doing?

522
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:51,667
Oh, you'll be thanking me later.

523
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:55,325
It's a long journey and Beaver gets pretty cranky when he's hungry.

524
00:56:55,362 --> 00:56:56,879
I'm cranky now!

525
00:56:59,265 --> 00:57:00,581
Take them.

526
00:57:03,854 --> 00:57:07,460
- Do you think we'll need jam?
- Only if the Witch serves toast.

527
00:57:22,778 --> 00:57:23,809
Hurry.

528
00:57:38,646 --> 00:57:42,086
Badger and me dug this. Comes out right near his place.

529
00:57:42,313 --> 00:57:44,638
You told me it led to your mum's!

530
00:57:45,802 --> 00:57:47,225
Lucy!

531
00:57:48,322 --> 00:57:49,852
They're in the tunnel.

532
00:57:50,038 --> 00:57:53,158
- Quick! This way.
- Hurry!

533
00:57:54,216 --> 00:57:56,218
- Run!
- Quick! Quick! Quick!

534
00:58:04,286 --> 00:58:06,519
You should have brought a map!

535
00:58:06,735 --> 00:58:08,829
There wasn't room next to the jam.

536
00:58:16,554 --> 00:58:19,092
Come on, Lucy!

537
00:58:38,222 --> 00:58:40,179
I'm so sorry, dear.

538
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:43,266
He was my best mate.

539
00:58:53,008 --> 00:58:54,289
What happened here?

540
00:58:54,488 --> 00:58:57,405
This is what becomes of those who cross the Witch.

541
00:58:57,584 --> 00:59:01,488
You take one more step, traitor, and I'll chew you to splinters!

542
00:59:01,524 --> 00:59:04,442
Relax. I'm one of the good guys.

543
00:59:04,512 --> 00:59:08,271
Yeah? Well, you look an awful lot like one of the bad ones.

544
00:59:08,582 --> 00:59:10,537
An unfortunate family resemblance.

545
00:59:10,851 --> 00:59:14,201
But we can argue breeding later. Right now we've got to move.

546
00:59:15,264 --> 00:59:17,340
What did you have in mind?

547
00:59:25,002 --> 00:59:26,699
Greetings, gents.

548
00:59:27,177 --> 00:59:30,653
- Lost something, have we?
- Don't patronize me!

549
00:59:31,014 --> 00:59:33,789
I know where your allegiance lies.

550
00:59:33,957 --> 00:59:35,451
We're looking for some humans.

551
00:59:36,971 --> 00:59:39,368
Humans? Here in Narnia?

552
00:59:39,597 --> 00:59:42,234
That's a valuable bit of information, don't you think?

553
00:59:43,767 --> 00:59:46,163
Your reward is your life.

554
00:59:46,417 --> 00:59:48,955
It's not much,

555
00:59:49,804 --> 00:59:51,298
but still.

556
00:59:51,612 --> 00:59:53,723
Where are the fugitives?

557
01:00:00,584 --> 01:00:03,680
North. They ran north.

558
01:00:04,541 --> 01:00:06,593
Smell them out.

559
01:00:17,159 --> 01:00:21,227
They were helping Tumnus. The Witch got here before I did.

560
01:00:23,378 --> 01:00:24,837
Are you all right?

561
01:00:24,963 --> 01:00:28,225
Well, I wish I could say their bark was worse than their bite. Ow!

562
01:00:28,626 --> 01:00:32,616
Stop squirming! You're worse than Beaver on bath day.

563
01:00:32,652 --> 01:00:34,145
Worst day of the year.

564
01:00:34,538 --> 01:00:37,136
Thank you for your kindness,

565
01:00:37,432 --> 01:00:39,135
but that's all the cure I have time for.

566
01:00:39,171 --> 01:00:39,934
You're leaving?

567
01:00:40,133 --> 01:00:43,847
It has been a pleasure, My Queen, and an honor, but time is short

568
01:00:44,146 --> 01:00:47,400
and Aslan himself has asked me to gather more troops.

569
01:00:47,437 --> 01:00:50,159
- You've seen Aslan?
- What's he like?

570
01:00:51,404 --> 01:00:54,043
Like everything we've ever heard.

571
01:00:54,105 --> 01:00:57,789
You'll be glad to have him by your side in the battle against the Witch.

572
01:00:58,099 --> 01:01:00,428
But we're not planning on fighting any witch.

573
01:01:00,596 --> 01:01:03,115
But surely, King Peter, the prophecy!

574
01:01:03,377 --> 01:01:05,767
We can't go to war without you.

575
01:01:11,130 --> 01:01:13,800
We just want our brother back.

576
01:01:38,305 --> 01:01:39,965
If...

577
01:01:41,336 --> 01:01:43,443
If you're not going to eat that...

578
01:01:50,009 --> 01:01:52,203
I'd get up, but...

579
01:01:53,354 --> 01:01:55,015
...but my legs.

580
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:08,176
Mr. Tumnus.

581
01:02:09,065 --> 01:02:10,838
What's left of him.

582
01:02:17,478 --> 01:02:21,374
- You're Lucy Pevensie's brother.
- I'm Edmund.

583
01:02:23,457 --> 01:02:25,687
Yes. Yes, you have the same nose.

584
01:02:30,255 --> 01:02:32,404
Is your sister all right?

585
01:02:34,445 --> 01:02:36,574
Is she safe?

586
01:02:40,085 --> 01:02:42,942
I don't know.

587
01:02:48,998 --> 01:02:53,107
My police tore that dam apart.

588
01:02:53,727 --> 01:02:57,689
Your little family are nowhere to be found.

589
01:03:01,409 --> 01:03:04,122
- Where did they go?
- I don't know!

590
01:03:04,709 --> 01:03:07,866
Then you're of no further use to me.

591
01:03:08,118 --> 01:03:12,385
Wait! The beaver said something about Aslan!

592
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:17,996
Aslan?

593
01:03:18,918 --> 01:03:20,450
Where?

594
01:03:23,677 --> 01:03:26,457
- I...
- He's a stranger here, Your Majesty.

595
01:03:26,623 --> 01:03:28,143
He can't be expected to know anything.

596
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:34,353
I said... where is Aslan?

597
01:03:37,738 --> 01:03:40,001
I... I don't know.

598
01:03:40,373 --> 01:03:42,603
I left before they said anything.

599
01:03:44,971 --> 01:03:47,095
I wanted to see you!

600
01:03:49,651 --> 01:03:51,408
Guard!

601
01:03:52,148 --> 01:03:53,969
Your Majesty.

602
01:03:55,737 --> 01:03:57,940
Release the faun.

603
01:04:11,890 --> 01:04:13,984
Do you know why you're here, faun?

604
01:04:15,450 --> 01:04:19,907
Because I believe in a free Narnia.

605
01:04:21,204 --> 01:04:22,492
You're here...

606
01:04:23,701 --> 01:04:27,606
...because he turned you in.

607
01:04:28,679 --> 01:04:31,087
For sweeties.

608
01:04:38,325 --> 01:04:40,507
Take him upstairs.

609
01:04:45,342 --> 01:04:47,659
And ready my sleigh.

610
01:04:48,304 --> 01:04:50,800
Edmund misses his family.

611
01:05:13,758 --> 01:05:17,355
Now, Aslan's camp is near the Stone Table

612
01:05:17,576 --> 01:05:20,422
- just across the frozen river.
- River?

613
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:23,706
The river's been frozen solid for a hundred years.

614
01:05:27,823 --> 01:05:31,246
- It's so far.
- It's the world, dear.

615
01:05:31,362 --> 01:05:33,179
Did you expect it to be small?

616
01:05:33,805 --> 01:05:35,984
Smaller.

617
01:05:53,398 --> 01:05:56,049
When you're ready, Son of Adam.

618
01:06:31,238 --> 01:06:34,718
Come on, humans! While we're still young.

619
01:06:35,954 --> 01:06:38,864
If he tells us to hurry one more time,

620
01:06:39,018 --> 01:06:42,200
I'm gonna turn him into a big, fluffy hat.

621
01:06:42,749 --> 01:06:44,652
Hurry up! Come on!

622
01:06:44,889 --> 01:06:48,576
- He is getting a little bossy.
- Behind you! It's her!

623
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:51,162
- Run! Run!
- Run!

624
01:07:15,868 --> 01:07:17,276
Hurry!

625
01:07:20,239 --> 01:07:21,956
Inside!

626
01:07:22,123 --> 01:07:23,927
Dive! Dive!

627
01:07:26,781 --> 01:07:28,050
Quick! Quick, quick, quick!

628
01:07:56,838 --> 01:08:00,156
Maybe she's gone.

629
01:08:00,205 --> 01:08:02,453
- I suppose I'll go look.
- No!

630
01:08:02,481 --> 01:08:05,078
You're worth nothing to Narnia dead.

631
01:08:05,674 --> 01:08:07,291
Well, neither are you, Beaver.

632
01:08:07,526 --> 01:08:09,574
Thanks, sweetheart.

633
01:08:24,869 --> 01:08:26,198
Come out! Come out!

634
01:08:26,386 --> 01:08:29,485
I hope you've all been good 'cause there's someone here to see you!

635
01:08:51,364 --> 01:08:53,083
Merry Christmas, sir.

636
01:08:53,632 --> 01:08:57,703
It certainly is, Lucy, since you have arrived.

637
01:08:57,828 --> 01:09:01,701
Look, I've put up with a lot since I got here, but this...

638
01:09:01,872 --> 01:09:05,361
- We thought you were the Witch.
- Yes, yes, I'm sorry about that,

639
01:09:05,562 --> 01:09:11,084
but in my defense, I have been driving one of these longer than the Witch.

640
01:09:11,263 --> 01:09:13,889
I thought there was no Christmas in Narnia.

641
01:09:14,055 --> 01:09:16,929
No. For a long time.

642
01:09:17,488 --> 01:09:20,567
But the hope that you have brought, Your Majesties,

643
01:09:21,166 --> 01:09:24,267
is finally starting to weaken the Witch's power.

644
01:09:25,391 --> 01:09:28,861
Still, I dare say you could do with these.

645
01:09:32,570 --> 01:09:34,455
Presents!

646
01:09:40,397 --> 01:09:42,561
The juice of the fire-flower.

647
01:09:42,921 --> 01:09:46,878
One drop will cure any injury.

648
01:09:48,630 --> 01:09:51,008
And though I hope you never have to use it...

649
01:09:54,206 --> 01:09:55,892
Thank you, sir,

650
01:09:56,714 --> 01:09:59,409
but I think I could be brave enough.

651
01:09:59,601 --> 01:10:01,714
I'm sure you could.

652
01:10:02,264 --> 01:10:05,473
But battles are ugly affairs.

653
01:10:12,414 --> 01:10:13,752
Susan.

654
01:10:17,134 --> 01:10:21,310
Trust in this bow and it will not easily miss.

655
01:10:22,737 --> 01:10:26,101
What happened to "battles are ugly affairs"?

656
01:10:27,407 --> 01:10:30,615
Though you don't seem to have a problem making yourself heard,

657
01:10:30,766 --> 01:10:34,141
blow on this and wherever you are,

658
01:10:35,246 --> 01:10:37,945
help will come.

659
01:10:38,155 --> 01:10:39,584
Thanks.

660
01:10:40,387 --> 01:10:42,178
Peter.

661
01:10:43,930 --> 01:10:47,150
The time to use these may be near at hand.

662
01:10:54,987 --> 01:10:57,371
Thank you, sir.

663
01:10:57,510 --> 01:11:00,756
These are tools, not toys.

664
01:11:01,129 --> 01:11:03,785
Bear them well and wisely.

665
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:07,970
Now, I must be off.

666
01:11:08,166 --> 01:11:10,268
Winter is almost over,

667
01:11:10,577 --> 01:11:15,170
and things do pile up when you've been gone a hundred years.

668
01:11:18,178 --> 01:11:20,806
Long live Aslan!

669
01:11:22,725 --> 01:11:25,211
And Merry Christmas!

670
01:11:27,293 --> 01:11:29,813
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

671
01:11:33,850 --> 01:11:35,492
Told you he was real.

672
01:11:35,999 --> 01:11:40,500
He said winter was almost over.

673
01:11:41,037 --> 01:11:42,430
You know what that means.

674
01:11:44,260 --> 01:11:46,581
No more ice.

675
01:11:56,737 --> 01:11:59,986
- We need to cross, now!
- Don't beavers make dams?

676
01:12:00,203 --> 01:12:02,502
- I'm not that fast, dear.
- Come on!

677
01:12:02,660 --> 01:12:04,701
Wait! Will you think about this for a minute?

678
01:12:04,893 --> 01:12:07,782
- We don't have a minute.
- I'm just trying to be realistic.

679
01:12:07,972 --> 01:12:11,632
No, you're trying to be smart. As usual.

680
01:12:46,035 --> 01:12:48,490
Wait. Maybe I should go first.

681
01:12:48,807 --> 01:12:50,627
Maybe you should.

682
01:12:57,410 --> 01:13:00,275
You've been sneaking second helpings, haven't you?

683
01:13:00,473 --> 01:13:02,881
Well, you never know which meal's gonna be your last.

684
01:13:03,026 --> 01:13:04,793
Especially with your cooking.

685
01:13:24,834 --> 01:13:26,293
If Mum knew what we were doing...

686
01:13:26,430 --> 01:13:28,072
Mum's not here.

687
01:13:29,679 --> 01:13:31,351
Oh, no!

688
01:13:32,171 --> 01:13:33,201
Run!

689
01:13:37,011 --> 01:13:38,348
Hurry!

690
01:13:49,715 --> 01:13:51,104
- No!
- Peter!

691
01:13:52,225 --> 01:13:54,110
Put that down, boy.

692
01:13:54,786 --> 01:13:57,999
- Someone could get hurt.
- Don't worry about me!

693
01:13:58,085 --> 01:13:59,442
Run him through!

694
01:13:59,478 --> 01:14:03,718
Leave now while you can, and your brother leaves with you.

695
01:14:03,932 --> 01:14:06,103
Stop, Peter! Maybe we should listen to him!

696
01:14:07,183 --> 01:14:08,117
Smart girl.

697
01:14:08,325 --> 01:14:11,599
Don't listen to him! Kill him! Kill him now!

698
01:14:11,829 --> 01:14:14,904
Oh, come on. This isn't your war.

699
01:14:15,096 --> 01:14:18,533
All my Queen wants is for you to take your family and go.

700
01:14:18,711 --> 01:14:21,279
Look, just because some man in a red coat hands you a sword,

701
01:14:21,442 --> 01:14:24,877
it doesn't make you a hero! Just drop it!

702
01:14:25,088 --> 01:14:27,561
No, Peter! Narnia needs you!

703
01:14:27,778 --> 01:14:29,781
Gut him while you still have a chance!

704
01:14:29,963 --> 01:14:34,275
What's it gonna be, Son of Adam? I won't wait forever.

705
01:14:34,491 --> 01:14:35,853
And neither will the river.

706
01:14:37,481 --> 01:14:38,852
Peter!

707
01:14:46,407 --> 01:14:47,890
Hold onto me!

708
01:15:49,561 --> 01:15:50,173
Lovely.

709
01:15:58,963 --> 01:16:00,123
What have you done?

710
01:16:03,181 --> 01:16:04,432
Lucy!

711
01:16:06,599 --> 01:16:08,405
Lucy!

712
01:16:13,334 --> 01:16:15,189
Has anyone seen my coat?

713
01:16:21,585 --> 01:16:23,335
Don't you worry, dear.

714
01:16:23,530 --> 01:16:26,684
Your brother's got you well looked after.

715
01:16:27,386 --> 01:16:31,524
And I don't think you'll be needing those coats anymore.

716
01:17:06,094 --> 01:17:08,792
It's so warm out.

717
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:14,796
I'll go and check the sleigh.

718
01:17:16,850 --> 01:17:18,384
Your Majesty.

719
01:17:19,101 --> 01:17:20,645
We found the traitor.

720
01:17:20,828 --> 01:17:23,340
He was rallying your enemies near the Shuddering Woods.

721
01:17:24,012 --> 01:17:26,461
Ah. Nice of you to drop in.

722
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:29,076
You were so helpful to my wolves last night.

723
01:17:29,234 --> 01:17:31,725
Perhaps you can help me now.

724
01:17:32,106 --> 01:17:35,810
- Forgive me, Your Majesty.
- Oh, don't waste time with flattery.

725
01:17:36,044 --> 01:17:39,809
Not to seem rude, but I wasn't actually talking to you.

726
01:17:48,372 --> 01:17:51,276
Where are the humans headed?

727
01:17:55,194 --> 01:17:59,963
Wait! No! Don't. The beaver said something about the Stone Table,

728
01:18:00,142 --> 01:18:02,266
and that Aslan had an army there.

729
01:18:03,499 --> 01:18:05,130
An army?

730
01:18:10,820 --> 01:18:12,378
Thank you, Edmund.

731
01:18:12,915 --> 01:18:16,527
I'm glad this creature got to see some honesty...

732
01:18:18,182 --> 01:18:21,317
...before he dies.
- No!

733
01:18:31,358 --> 01:18:34,132
Think about whose side you're on, Edmund.

734
01:18:34,655 --> 01:18:35,871
Mine...

735
01:18:38,622 --> 01:18:40,580
...or theirs.

736
01:18:46,442 --> 01:18:49,294
Go on ahead. Gather the faithful.

737
01:18:50,199 --> 01:18:52,639
If it's a war Aslan wants...

738
01:18:54,857 --> 01:18:57,310
...it's a war he shall get.

739
01:19:58,486 --> 01:20:00,233
Why are they all staring at us?

740
01:20:00,946 --> 01:20:03,831
Maybe they think you look funny.

741
01:20:08,574 --> 01:20:11,817
Oi, stop your fussing. You look lovely.

742
01:20:30,312 --> 01:20:32,778
We have come to see Aslan.

743
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:19,726
Welcome, Peter, Son of Adam.

744
01:21:19,992 --> 01:21:23,775
Welcome, Susan and Lucy, Daughters of Eve.

745
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:27,230
And welcome to you, Beavers. You have my thanks.

746
01:21:27,382 --> 01:21:29,956
But where is the fourth?

747
01:21:31,114 --> 01:21:32,692
That's why we're here, sir.

748
01:21:34,186 --> 01:21:35,507
We need your help.

749
01:21:36,018 --> 01:21:38,184
We had a little trouble along the way.

750
01:21:39,506 --> 01:21:41,182
Our brother's been captured by the White Witch.

751
01:21:41,313 --> 01:21:44,163
Captured? How could this happen?

752
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:50,276
He betrayed them, Your Majesty.

753
01:21:50,406 --> 01:21:53,510
- Then he has betrayed us all!
- Peace, Oreius.

754
01:21:54,327 --> 01:21:56,170
I'm sure there's an explanation.

755
01:21:59,108 --> 01:22:00,587
It's my fault, really.

756
01:22:02,529 --> 01:22:04,534
I was too hard on him.

757
01:22:08,683 --> 01:22:10,863
We all were.

758
01:22:11,164 --> 01:22:12,965
Sir, he's our brother.

759
01:22:13,044 --> 01:22:15,042
I know, dear one.

760
01:22:15,332 --> 01:22:17,954
But that only makes the betrayal all the worse.

761
01:22:18,836 --> 01:22:21,083
This may be harder than you think.

762
01:22:28,859 --> 01:22:33,630
That is Cair Paravel, the castle of the four thrones.

763
01:22:34,614 --> 01:22:38,321
In one of which you will sit, Peter, as High King.

764
01:22:39,796 --> 01:22:41,988
You doubt the prophecy?

765
01:22:42,045 --> 01:22:45,579
No. That's just it.

766
01:22:46,841 --> 01:22:49,646
Aslan, I'm not what you all think I am.

767
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:52,574
Peter Pevensie, formerly of Finchley.

768
01:22:54,129 --> 01:22:58,441
Beaver also mentioned that you planned on turning him into a hat.

769
01:23:01,129 --> 01:23:04,760
Peter, there is a Deep Magic,

770
01:23:04,905 --> 01:23:08,602
more powerful than any of us, that rules over all of Narnia.

771
01:23:09,074 --> 01:23:10,971
It defines right from wrong,

772
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:13,968
and governs all our destinies.

773
01:23:14,137 --> 01:23:17,815
Yours... and mine.

774
01:23:18,148 --> 01:23:19,632
But I couldn't even protect my own family.

775
01:23:19,833 --> 01:23:21,605
You've brought them safely this far.

776
01:23:23,177 --> 01:23:24,817
Not all of them.

777
01:23:25,084 --> 01:23:28,723
Peter, I will do what I can to help your brother,

778
01:23:29,141 --> 01:23:32,398
but I need you to consider what I ask of you.

779
01:23:34,244 --> 01:23:37,023
I, too, want my family safe.

780
01:23:39,867 --> 01:23:43,769
Is our little prince uncomfortable?

781
01:23:43,982 --> 01:23:46,989
Does he want his pillow fluffed?

782
01:23:49,635 --> 01:23:53,317
Special treatment for the special boy!

783
01:23:55,060 --> 01:23:57,888
Isn't that what you wanted?

784
01:23:59,944 --> 01:24:01,386
You look like Mum.

785
01:24:01,913 --> 01:24:05,028
Mum hasn't had a dress like this since before the war.

786
01:24:06,079 --> 01:24:10,191
We should bring her one back. A whole trunk full!

787
01:24:11,527 --> 01:24:14,086
If we ever get back.

788
01:24:17,622 --> 01:24:19,458
I'm sorry I'm like that.

789
01:24:21,555 --> 01:24:24,840
We used to have fun together, didn't we?

790
01:24:25,043 --> 01:24:28,497
Yes. Before you got boring.

791
01:24:29,246 --> 01:24:30,661
Oh, really?

792
01:24:44,006 --> 01:24:45,640
Please don't try to run.

793
01:24:45,689 --> 01:24:49,374
- We're tired.
- And we prefer to kill you quickly.

794
01:24:54,359 --> 01:24:55,402
Susan!

795
01:25:05,412 --> 01:25:06,799
Get back!

796
01:25:07,855 --> 01:25:08,967
Peter! Ah!

797
01:25:11,387 --> 01:25:12,406
Come on.

798
01:25:13,739 --> 01:25:16,348
We've already been through this before.

799
01:25:16,741 --> 01:25:19,373
We both know you haven't got it in you.

800
01:25:19,475 --> 01:25:21,569
Peter! Watch out!

801
01:25:30,588 --> 01:25:34,894
No! Stay your weapons. This is Peter's battle.

802
01:25:36,354 --> 01:25:38,642
You may think you're a king,

803
01:25:38,823 --> 01:25:40,778
but you're going to die...

804
01:25:40,884 --> 01:25:42,794
...like a dog!
- Look out!

805
01:25:43,714 --> 01:25:44,811
Peter!

806
01:26:02,771 --> 01:26:03,820
After him.

807
01:26:05,694 --> 01:26:07,376
He'll lead you to Edmund.

808
01:26:12,368 --> 01:26:13,218
Peter.

809
01:26:14,035 --> 01:26:15,721
Clean your sword.

810
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:24,613
Rise, Sir Peter Wolf's-Bane,

811
01:26:25,129 --> 01:26:27,880
Knight of Narnia.

812
01:26:54,016 --> 01:26:55,794
The minotaurs will take the left flanks.

813
01:26:56,131 --> 01:26:58,726
We'll keep the giants in reserve and send the dwarfs in first.

814
01:27:08,359 --> 01:27:09,455
The prisoner!

815
01:27:38,641 --> 01:27:40,446
You're not going to kill me?

816
01:27:44,101 --> 01:27:45,311
Not yet.

817
01:27:48,981 --> 01:27:51,174
We have work to do.

818
01:28:22,645 --> 01:28:23,863
Edmund!

819
01:28:56,327 --> 01:28:58,002
What's done is done.

820
01:28:58,641 --> 01:29:02,326
There is no need to speak to Edmund about what is past.

821
01:29:11,664 --> 01:29:13,109
Hello.

822
01:29:27,268 --> 01:29:29,742
- Are you all right?
- I'm a little tired.

823
01:29:30,715 --> 01:29:32,465
Get some sleep.

824
01:29:40,629 --> 01:29:42,216
And Edmund...

825
01:29:44,869 --> 01:29:47,992
...try not to wander off.

826
01:29:59,914 --> 01:30:02,559
Narnia's not going to run out of toast, Ed.

827
01:30:04,221 --> 01:30:06,707
I'm sure they'll pack something up for the journey back.

828
01:30:07,346 --> 01:30:08,655
We're going home?

829
01:30:09,658 --> 01:30:11,099
You are.

830
01:30:12,917 --> 01:30:15,176
I promised Mum I'd keep you three safe.

831
01:30:16,544 --> 01:30:18,584
But it doesn't mean I can't stay behind and help.

832
01:30:19,008 --> 01:30:20,151
But they need us.

833
01:30:22,660 --> 01:30:24,718
All four of us.

834
01:30:24,896 --> 01:30:26,220
Lucy, it's too dangerous.

835
01:30:26,534 --> 01:30:28,842
You almost drowned! Edmund was almost killed!

836
01:30:29,978 --> 01:30:31,893
Which is why we have to stay.

837
01:30:34,755 --> 01:30:39,164
I've seen what the White Witch can do. And I've helped her do it.

838
01:30:40,708 --> 01:30:43,476
And we can't leave these people behind to suffer for it.

839
01:30:51,544 --> 01:30:53,464
I suppose that's it then.

840
01:30:55,286 --> 01:30:56,826
Where are you going?

841
01:30:58,866 --> 01:31:01,441
To get in some practice.

842
01:31:24,495 --> 01:31:27,548
Come on, Ed! Sword point up, like Oreius showed us.

843
01:31:27,754 --> 01:31:29,315
- En garde!
- Now block.

844
01:31:30,999 --> 01:31:33,933
- Hey!
- Peter! Edmund!

845
01:31:35,384 --> 01:31:36,940
Whoa, horsie!

846
01:31:37,302 --> 01:31:39,875
- My name is Philip.
- Oh.

847
01:31:40,264 --> 01:31:41,721
Sorry.

848
01:31:41,866 --> 01:31:44,483
The Witch has demanded a meeting with Aslan.

849
01:31:45,835 --> 01:31:47,263
She's on her way here.

850
01:31:48,256 --> 01:31:52,290
Jadis, the Queen of Narnia!

851
01:31:53,084 --> 01:31:56,270
Empress of the Lone Islands!

852
01:32:23,718 --> 01:32:26,736
You have a traitor in your midst, Aslan.

853
01:32:29,446 --> 01:32:32,741
His offense was not against you.

854
01:32:33,089 --> 01:32:36,476
Have you forgotten the laws upon which Narnia was built?

855
01:32:36,708 --> 01:32:39,358
Do not cite the Deep Magic to me, Witch.

856
01:32:39,848 --> 01:32:42,410
I was there when it was written.

857
01:32:43,849 --> 01:32:48,454
Then you'll remember well that every traitor belongs to me.

858
01:32:49,863 --> 01:32:51,634
His blood is my property.

859
01:32:52,459 --> 01:32:54,425
Try and take him then.

860
01:32:57,666 --> 01:33:01,478
Do you really think that mere force will deny me my right...

861
01:33:03,127 --> 01:33:05,189
...little King?

862
01:33:07,246 --> 01:33:10,747
Aslan knows that unless I have blood, as the law demands,

863
01:33:11,581 --> 01:33:14,782
all of Narnia will be overturned

864
01:33:15,107 --> 01:33:17,907
and perish in fire and water.

865
01:33:18,086 --> 01:33:20,849
That boy will die

866
01:33:21,042 --> 01:33:22,568
on the Stone Table...

867
01:33:26,421 --> 01:33:28,899
...as is tradition.

868
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:33,433
You dare not refuse me.

869
01:33:34,130 --> 01:33:35,651
Enough.

870
01:33:38,447 --> 01:33:41,188
I shall talk with you alone.

871
01:34:33,889 --> 01:34:37,111
She has renounced her claim on the Son of Adam's blood.

872
01:34:39,203 --> 01:34:41,603
How do I know your promise will be kept?

873
01:35:35,056 --> 01:35:38,347
- Susan!
- Mm?

874
01:36:27,252 --> 01:36:29,940
Shouldn't you both be in bed?

875
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:34,522
We couldn't sleep.

876
01:36:36,138 --> 01:36:37,479
Please, Aslan.

877
01:36:38,964 --> 01:36:40,905
Couldn't we come with you?

878
01:36:41,284 --> 01:36:43,811
I would be glad of the company for a while.

879
01:36:45,489 --> 01:36:47,152
Thank you.

880
01:37:11,720 --> 01:37:12,559
It is time.

881
01:37:13,274 --> 01:37:16,992
From here, I must go on alone.

882
01:37:17,208 --> 01:37:17,702
But Aslan...

883
01:37:17,903 --> 01:37:22,355
You have to trust me. For this must be done.

884
01:37:22,594 --> 01:37:23,614
Thank you, Susan.

885
01:37:24,317 --> 01:37:26,268
Thank you, Lucy.

886
01:37:26,794 --> 01:37:28,552
And farewell.

887
01:38:33,983 --> 01:38:38,305
Behold. The great lion.

888
01:39:03,740 --> 01:39:05,514
Do you want some milk?

889
01:39:06,887 --> 01:39:08,817
Why doesn't he fight back?

890
01:39:10,301 --> 01:39:11,609
Bind him!

891
01:39:21,688 --> 01:39:22,829
Wait!

892
01:39:23,632 --> 01:39:26,785
Let him first be shaved.

893
01:39:48,373 --> 01:39:50,770
Bring him to me.

894
01:40:51,458 --> 01:40:52,753
You know, Aslan,

895
01:40:54,126 --> 01:40:56,199
I'm a little disappointed in you.

896
01:40:58,294 --> 01:41:02,338
Did you honestly think by all this that you could save the human traitor?

897
01:41:05,528 --> 01:41:08,120
You are giving me your life

898
01:41:08,246 --> 01:41:10,737
and saving no one.

899
01:41:13,064 --> 01:41:15,157
So much for love.

900
01:41:23,939 --> 01:41:25,125
Tonight...

901
01:41:27,197 --> 01:41:32,181
...the Deep Magic will be appeased!

902
01:41:35,044 --> 01:41:36,863
But tomorrow,

903
01:41:38,599 --> 01:41:42,784
we will take Narnia

904
01:41:43,028 --> 01:41:48,235
forever!

905
01:41:52,186 --> 01:41:53,719
In that knowledge,

906
01:41:54,966 --> 01:41:56,269
despair...

907
01:42:06,804 --> 01:42:10,386
...and die!

908
01:42:27,661 --> 01:42:29,563
The Great Cat...

909
01:42:30,045 --> 01:42:32,782
...is dead!

910
01:42:35,925 --> 01:42:37,187
General.

911
01:42:38,143 --> 01:42:40,325
Prepare your troops for battle.

912
01:42:44,048 --> 01:42:46,135
However short it may be.

913
01:43:34,827 --> 01:43:36,444
It's too late.

914
01:43:38,192 --> 01:43:40,008
He's gone.

915
01:43:58,993 --> 01:44:01,809
He must have known what he was doing.

916
01:44:35,315 --> 01:44:38,675
Get away! Get away, all of you!

917
01:44:39,444 --> 01:44:42,447
No. Look.

918
01:45:02,879 --> 01:45:04,696
We have to tell the others.

919
01:45:05,555 --> 01:45:09,209
- We can't just leave him!
- Lucy, there's no time.

920
01:45:09,456 --> 01:45:11,060
They need to know.

921
01:45:18,078 --> 01:45:20,124
The trees.

922
01:46:04,311 --> 01:46:06,146
Be still, my Princes.

923
01:46:08,199 --> 01:46:11,475
I bring grave news from your sisters.

924
01:46:26,398 --> 01:46:27,890
She's right.

925
01:46:31,540 --> 01:46:33,446
He's gone.

926
01:46:39,081 --> 01:46:41,136
Then you'll have to lead us.

927
01:46:43,278 --> 01:46:48,529
Peter, there's an army out there and it's ready to follow you.

928
01:46:48,588 --> 01:46:51,540
- I can't.
- Aslan believed you could.

929
01:46:55,123 --> 01:46:57,130
And so do I.

930
01:47:04,303 --> 01:47:08,408
The Witch's army is nearing, sire. What are your orders?

931
01:47:53,978 --> 01:47:57,927
They come, Your Highness, in numbers and weapons far greater than our own.

932
01:47:58,150 --> 01:48:00,053
Numbers do not win a battle.

933
01:48:00,257 --> 01:48:03,814
No. But I bet they help.

934
01:49:33,877 --> 01:49:35,996
I have no interest in prisoners.

935
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:38,261
Kill them all.

936
01:50:35,524 --> 01:50:38,351
Look to the sky!

937
01:51:05,147 --> 01:51:06,594
Are you with me?

938
01:51:08,600 --> 01:51:09,926
To the death.

939
01:51:13,112 --> 01:51:18,394
For Narnia and for Aslan!

940
01:51:21,542 --> 01:51:22,314
Go!

941
01:51:23,862 --> 01:51:27,408
Go! For Aslan!

942
01:52:59,049 --> 01:53:00,604
We should go.

943
01:53:06,233 --> 01:53:08,226
I'm so cold.

944
01:53:34,302 --> 01:53:35,848
Susan!

945
01:53:52,528 --> 01:53:53,721
Where's Aslan?

946
01:53:55,757 --> 01:53:57,440
What have they done?

947
01:54:07,602 --> 01:54:09,839
Aslan!

948
01:54:17,651 --> 01:54:20,337
But we saw the knife. The Witch.

949
01:54:20,538 --> 01:54:23,327
If the Witch knew the true meaning of sacrifice,

950
01:54:23,798 --> 01:54:26,817
she might have interpreted the Deep Magic differently.

951
01:54:27,009 --> 01:54:30,037
That when a willing victim who has committed no treachery

952
01:54:30,225 --> 01:54:32,208
is killed in a traitor's stead,

953
01:54:32,864 --> 01:54:34,631
the Stone Table will crack

954
01:54:35,412 --> 01:54:39,094
and even death itself will turn backwards.

955
01:54:39,119 --> 01:54:41,461
We sent the news that you were dead.

956
01:54:41,968 --> 01:54:44,102
Peter and Edmund will have gone to war.

957
01:54:44,250 --> 01:54:45,323
We have to help them.

958
01:54:45,835 --> 01:54:49,377
We will, dear one, but not alone.

959
01:54:49,960 --> 01:54:51,638
Climb on my back.

960
01:54:51,864 --> 01:54:54,956
We have far to go and little time to get there.

961
01:54:55,145 --> 01:54:57,302
And you may want to cover your ears.

962
01:55:17,695 --> 01:55:19,575
Fire!

963
01:55:39,408 --> 01:55:41,469
Yes!

964
01:55:53,676 --> 01:55:57,091
Fall back! Draw them to the rocks!

965
01:55:58,068 --> 01:56:00,722
That's the signal. Come on!

966
01:56:08,292 --> 01:56:09,708
Where are we going?

967
01:56:20,040 --> 01:56:21,808
Hang on!

968
01:56:23,044 --> 01:56:24,207
Fall back!

969
01:57:04,105 --> 01:57:06,108
Stop!

970
01:59:18,130 --> 01:59:20,048
Susan, this is...

971
01:59:20,225 --> 01:59:21,762
Mr. Tumnus!

972
01:59:23,112 --> 01:59:26,440
Come, we must hurry and search the castle.

973
01:59:26,652 --> 01:59:29,601
Peter will need everyone we can find.

974
01:59:56,089 --> 01:59:58,574
Edmund! There's too many!

975
01:59:58,678 --> 02:00:00,344
Get out of here!

976
02:00:00,540 --> 02:00:03,296
Get the girls and get them home!

977
02:00:05,660 --> 02:00:08,080
You heard him! Let's go!

978
02:00:27,966 --> 02:00:29,390
Peter said get out of here!

979
02:00:29,543 --> 02:00:31,142
Peter's not king yet.

980
02:02:08,339 --> 02:02:10,002
Impossible!

981
02:03:24,506 --> 02:03:26,443
It is finished.

982
02:03:27,614 --> 02:03:29,022
- Peter!
- Peter!

983
02:03:35,138 --> 02:03:36,963
Where's Edmund?

984
02:03:48,570 --> 02:03:50,687
Edmund!

985
02:04:43,352 --> 02:04:46,058
When are you gonna learn to do as you're told?

986
02:06:21,461 --> 02:06:24,046
To the glistening Eastern Sea,

987
02:06:24,315 --> 02:06:28,351
I give you Queen Lucy the Valiant.

988
02:06:53,491 --> 02:06:55,666
To the great Western Wood,

989
02:06:55,970 --> 02:07:00,167
King Edmund the Just.

990
02:07:01,494 --> 02:07:04,014
To the radiant Southern Sun,

991
02:07:05,508 --> 02:07:09,518
Queen Susan, the Gentle.

992
02:07:10,289 --> 02:07:13,577
And to the clear Northern Sky,

993
02:07:14,122 --> 02:07:16,255
I give you King Peter,

994
02:07:17,314 --> 02:07:19,402
the Magnificent.

995
02:07:23,459 --> 02:07:25,797
Once a King or Queen of Narnia,

996
02:07:26,044 --> 02:07:28,934
always a King or Queen.

997
02:07:29,515 --> 02:07:31,369
May your wisdom grace us

998
02:07:31,490 --> 02:07:34,295
until the stars rain down from the heavens.

999
02:07:35,025 --> 02:07:36,763
Long live King Peter!

1000
02:07:37,485 --> 02:07:39,237
Long live King Edmund!

1001
02:07:40,243 --> 02:07:42,136
Long live Queen Susan!

1002
02:07:42,617 --> 02:07:45,356
Long live Queen Lucy!

1003
02:08:09,946 --> 02:08:10,932
Don't worry.

1004
02:08:13,870 --> 02:08:15,624
We'll see him again.

1005
02:08:15,801 --> 02:08:18,050
- When?
- In time.

1006
02:08:19,484 --> 02:08:24,114
One day he'll be here and the next he won't.

1007
02:08:25,728 --> 02:08:27,533
But you mustn't press him.

1008
02:08:28,808 --> 02:08:32,054
After all, he's not a tame lion.

1009
02:08:32,257 --> 02:08:33,698
No.

1010
02:08:34,374 --> 02:08:36,531
But he is good.

1011
02:08:37,995 --> 02:08:39,063
Here.

1012
02:08:40,152 --> 02:08:43,370
You need it more than I do.

1013
02:09:38,493 --> 02:09:39,708
Are you all right, Philip?

1014
02:09:40,899 --> 02:09:42,949
I'm not as young as I once was.

1015
02:09:45,501 --> 02:09:46,597
Come on, Ed.

1016
02:09:47,960 --> 02:09:51,078
- Just catching my breath.
- That's all we'll catch at this rate.

1017
02:09:51,236 --> 02:09:53,565
- What did he say, Susan? - "Wait in the castle.

1018
02:09:53,742 --> 02:09:55,508
I'll get the stag myself."

1019
02:10:01,034 --> 02:10:02,987
What's this?

1020
02:10:08,400 --> 02:10:10,240
It seems familiar.

1021
02:10:13,026 --> 02:10:15,240
As if from a dream.

1022
02:10:15,316 --> 02:10:16,924
Or a dream of a dream.

1023
02:10:20,717 --> 02:10:22,877
Spare Oom.

1024
02:10:25,588 --> 02:10:27,583
- Lucy!
- Not again.

1025
02:10:29,827 --> 02:10:31,633
- Lu?
- Come on!

1026
02:10:43,381 --> 02:10:44,650
These aren't branches.

1027
02:10:47,292 --> 02:10:50,505
- They're coats.
- Susan, you're on my foot!

1028
02:10:50,704 --> 02:10:52,300
Peter, move off!

1029
02:10:52,735 --> 02:10:54,861
- Stop shoving.
- Stop it!

1030
02:10:55,059 --> 02:10:56,684
I'm not on your toe!

1031
02:11:14,749 --> 02:11:16,623
There you are.

1032
02:11:19,271 --> 02:11:21,666
What were you all doing in the wardrobe?

1033
02:11:23,152 --> 02:11:26,332
You wouldn't believe us if we told you, sir.

1034
02:11:32,188 --> 02:11:34,135
Try me.

1035
02:12:36,972 --> 02:12:39,180
I don't think you'll get back in that way.

1036
02:12:42,292 --> 02:12:46,293
You see... I've already tried.

1037
02:12:49,217 --> 02:12:50,770
Will we ever go back?

1038
02:12:51,518 --> 02:12:52,751
Oh, I expect so.

1039
02:12:54,255 --> 02:12:57,053
But it'll probably happen when you're not looking for it.

1040
02:12:59,524 --> 02:13:01,271
All the same...

1041
02:13:01,313 --> 02:13:03,062
best to keep your eyes open.
