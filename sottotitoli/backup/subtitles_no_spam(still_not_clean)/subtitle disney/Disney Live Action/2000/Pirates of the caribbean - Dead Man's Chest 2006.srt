1
00:02:23,038 --> 00:02:24,747
Will.

2
00:02:25,748 --> 00:02:27,667
- Why is this happening?
- I don't know.

3
00:02:30,086 --> 00:02:32,338
You look beautiful.

4
00:02:33,715 --> 00:02:37,051
I think it's bad luck for the groom
to see the bride before the wedding.

5
00:02:37,218 --> 00:02:39,054
Make way. Let me through. What in--?

6
00:02:39,221 --> 00:02:40,430
How dare you.

7
00:02:40,597 --> 00:02:42,014
Stand your men down at once!

8
00:02:42,182 --> 00:02:44,308
Do you hear me?

9
00:02:45,393 --> 00:02:47,728
Governor Weatherby Swann,
it's been too long.

10
00:02:48,354 --> 00:02:51,900
- Cutler Beckett?
- It's Lord now, actually.

11
00:02:53,692 --> 00:02:58,906
Lord or not, you have no reason
and no authority to arrest this man.

12
00:02:59,406 --> 00:03:00,783
In fact, I do.

13
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:01,951
Mr. Mercer.

14
00:03:04,454 --> 00:03:07,915
The warrant for the arrest
of one William Turner.

15
00:03:13,003 --> 00:03:14,838
This warrant is for Elizabeth Swann.

16
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,509
Oh, is it? That's annoying.
My mistake. Arrest her.

17
00:03:18,676 --> 00:03:20,094
- On what charges?
- No!

18
00:03:21,346 --> 00:03:22,973
Here's the one for William Turner.

19
00:03:23,931 --> 00:03:28,937
And I have another one for
a Mr. James Norrington. Is he present?

20
00:03:29,103 --> 00:03:30,396
What are the charges?

21
00:03:30,562 --> 00:03:34,025
Commodore Norrington resigned
his commission some months ago.

22
00:03:34,192 --> 00:03:36,620
I don't believe that was the answer
to the question I asked.

23
00:03:36,694 --> 00:03:40,406
Lord Beckett, in the category of questions
not answered.

24
00:03:40,573 --> 00:03:43,784
We are under the jurisdiction
of the king's governor of Port Royal

25
00:03:43,951 --> 00:03:46,288
and you will tell us
what we are charged with.

26
00:03:46,454 --> 00:03:48,914
The charge is:

27
00:03:49,081 --> 00:03:51,459
"Conspiring to set free a man
convicted of crimes

28
00:03:51,626 --> 00:03:53,836
against the crown and empire

29
00:03:54,003 --> 00:03:56,088
and condemned to death.

30
00:03:56,256 --> 00:03:57,799
For which the--"

31
00:03:57,966 --> 00:04:01,510
For which the punishment, regrettably,
is also death.

32
00:04:04,097 --> 00:04:07,182
Perhaps you remember a certain pirate
named Jack Sparrow.

33
00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:09,102
- Captain.
- Captain.

34
00:04:10,478 --> 00:04:11,937
Captain Jack Sparrow.

35
00:04:13,314 --> 00:04:15,984
Captain Jack Sparrow.

36
00:04:16,151 --> 00:04:18,569
Yes, I thought you might.

37
00:04:19,903 --> 00:04:25,410
<i>Fifteen men on a dead man's chest</i>

38
00:04:25,576 --> 00:04:30,290
<i>Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum</i>

39
00:04:30,456 --> 00:04:35,670
<i>Drink and the devil
Had done for the rest</i>

40
00:04:35,836 --> 00:04:41,550
<i>Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum</i>

41
00:05:03,156 --> 00:05:04,824
Aye there. Come on.

42
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,911
Oh, God. I don't want this.

43
00:05:08,077 --> 00:05:13,249
Oh, God. No. Please help me. No.

44
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:25,595
No! No!

45
00:06:43,255 --> 00:06:44,257
Sorry, mate.

46
00:06:47,509 --> 00:06:50,096
Mind if we make a little side trip?

47
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,432
I didn't think so.

48
00:07:00,023 --> 00:07:01,690
Not quite according to plan.

49
00:07:01,858 --> 00:07:05,862
Complications arose, ensued,
were overcome.

50
00:07:07,488 --> 00:07:10,240
You got what you went in for, then?

51
00:07:13,244 --> 00:07:16,331
Captain, I think the crew,
meaning me as well,

52
00:07:16,497 --> 00:07:19,834
were expecting something
a bit more shiny.

53
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,252
What with the Isla de Muerta
going all pear-shaped,

54
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,295
reclaimed by the sea
and the treasure with it.

55
00:07:24,422 --> 00:07:26,841
And the Royal Navy chasing us
all around the Atlantic.

56
00:07:27,007 --> 00:07:28,468
- And the hurricane.
- Aye.

57
00:07:28,634 --> 00:07:29,636
- Aye.
- Aye.

58
00:07:29,802 --> 00:07:34,682
All in all, it's seems some time
since we did a speck of honest pirating.

59
00:07:36,683 --> 00:07:40,021
- Shiny?
- Aye, shiny,

60
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,689
Is that how you're all feeling, then?

61
00:07:42,856 --> 00:07:46,653
That perhaps dear old Jack is not serving
your best interests as captain?

62
00:07:48,737 --> 00:07:49,822
Walk the plank.

63
00:07:50,615 --> 00:07:51,824
What did the bird say?

64
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:53,617
Do not blame the bird.

65
00:07:53,784 --> 00:07:56,204
Show us what is on that piece
of cloth there.

66
00:08:05,213 --> 00:08:08,675
- You know that don't do no good.
- It does me.

67
00:08:10,843 --> 00:08:12,928
- It's a key.
- No.

68
00:08:13,096 --> 00:08:14,096
Much more better.

69
00:08:15,305 --> 00:08:18,560
It is a drawing of a key.

70
00:08:24,524 --> 00:08:26,317
Gentlemen,

71
00:08:26,526 --> 00:08:28,360
what do keys do?

72
00:08:29,444 --> 00:08:31,238
Keys

73
00:08:31,406 --> 00:08:33,700
unlock things?

74
00:08:33,865 --> 00:08:37,662
And whatever this key unlocks, inside,
there's something valuable.

75
00:08:37,828 --> 00:08:40,914
So we're setting out to find
whatever this key unlocks.

76
00:08:41,081 --> 00:08:42,667
No.

77
00:08:43,293 --> 00:08:47,171
If we don't have the key, we can't open
whatever it is we don't have that it unlocks.

78
00:08:47,337 --> 00:08:51,091
So, what purpose would be served
in finding whatever need be unlocked,

79
00:08:51,259 --> 00:08:54,846
which we don't have, without first
having found the key what unlocks it?

80
00:08:55,804 --> 00:08:58,057
So we're going after this key.

81
00:08:59,057 --> 00:09:00,643
You're not making any sense at all.

82
00:09:02,102 --> 00:09:03,937
Any more questions?

83
00:09:04,105 --> 00:09:06,607
So do we have a heading?

84
00:09:07,734 --> 00:09:09,277
A heading.

85
00:09:10,945 --> 00:09:13,697
Set sail in a...

86
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:16,200
general...

87
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,750
- that way direction.
- Captain?

88
00:09:24,292 --> 00:09:27,919
Come on, snap to and make sail,
you know how this works. Come on.

89
00:09:32,549 --> 00:09:38,096
Have you noticed lately the captain
seems to be acting a bit strange--

90
00:09:38,264 --> 00:09:39,514
--er?

91
00:09:39,682 --> 00:09:42,309
Setting sail
without knowing his own heading?

92
00:09:42,476 --> 00:09:44,437
Something's got Jack vexed.

93
00:09:44,604 --> 00:09:49,442
Mark my words, what bodes ill
for Jack Sparrow bodes ill for us all.

94
00:10:03,748 --> 00:10:06,208
Lord Beckett,
the prisoner as ordered, sir.

95
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,503
Those won't be necessary.

96
00:10:12,423 --> 00:10:15,634
The East India Trading Company
has need of your services.

97
00:10:21,264 --> 00:10:23,350
We wish for you to act as our agent

98
00:10:23,518 --> 00:10:27,437
in a business transaction
with our mutual friend, Captain Sparrow.

99
00:10:27,605 --> 00:10:29,899
More acquaintance than friend.
How do you know him?

100
00:10:30,066 --> 00:10:31,900
We've had dealings in the past.

101
00:10:33,903 --> 00:10:36,239
And we've each left our mark

102
00:10:36,405 --> 00:10:37,572
on the other.

103
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,991
What mark did he leave on you?

104
00:10:42,703 --> 00:10:46,331
By your efforts,
Jack Sparrow was set free.

105
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,543
I would like you to go to him

106
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:52,212
and recover a certain property
in his possession.

107
00:10:53,338 --> 00:10:56,008
Recover. At the point of a sword?

108
00:10:56,676 --> 00:10:58,302
Bargain.

109
00:11:04,933 --> 00:11:07,144
Letters of marque.

110
00:11:08,354 --> 00:11:10,898
You will offer what amounts
to a full pardon.

111
00:11:11,065 --> 00:11:15,193
Jack will be free,
a privateer in the employ of England.

112
00:11:15,945 --> 00:11:18,239
Somehow I doubt Jack
will consider employment

113
00:11:18,405 --> 00:11:19,698
the same as being free.

114
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,908
Freedom.

115
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:26,831
Jack Sparrow is a dying breed.

116
00:11:27,331 --> 00:11:29,292
The world is shrinking,

117
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:32,586
the blank edges of the map filled in.

118
00:11:32,836 --> 00:11:35,881
Jack must find his place in the new world
or perish.

119
00:11:36,841 --> 00:11:39,552
Not unlike you, Mr. Turner.

120
00:11:39,719 --> 00:11:42,471
You and your fiancÃ©e
face the hangman's noose.

121
00:11:43,221 --> 00:11:45,182
So you get both Jack
and the <i>Black</i> Pearl.

122
00:11:46,933 --> 00:11:47,976
<i>The Black Pearl?</i>

123
00:11:48,144 --> 00:11:50,020
The property you want
that he possesses.

124
00:11:50,187 --> 00:11:51,773
A ship? Hardly.

125
00:11:52,273 --> 00:11:56,318
The item in question's considerably
smaller and far more valuable.

126
00:11:56,485 --> 00:11:59,989
Something Sparrow keeps
on his person at all times.

127
00:12:00,155 --> 00:12:01,157
A compass.

128
00:12:03,283 --> 00:12:04,994
You know it.

129
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:08,623
Bring back that compass

130
00:12:08,789 --> 00:12:10,707
or there's no deal.

131
00:12:36,192 --> 00:12:39,070
Why is the rum always gone?

132
00:12:47,036 --> 00:12:48,745
That's why.

133
00:12:55,669 --> 00:12:57,587
As you were, gents.

134
00:13:32,748 --> 00:13:34,375
Time's run out, Jack.

135
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:55,270
Bootstrap.

136
00:13:55,812 --> 00:13:56,813
Bill Turner?

137
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,197
You look good, Jack.

138
00:14:12,038 --> 00:14:13,038
Is this a dream?

139
00:14:14,081 --> 00:14:15,081
No.

140
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:18,336
I thought not. If it were, there'd be rum.

141
00:14:27,345 --> 00:14:29,721
You got the <i>Pearl</i> back, I see.

142
00:14:30,472 --> 00:14:33,475
I had some help retrieving the Pearl,
by the way.

143
00:14:35,436 --> 00:14:36,479
Your son.

144
00:14:37,855 --> 00:14:38,855
William?

145
00:14:41,232 --> 00:14:43,945
Ended up a pirate after all.

146
00:14:44,528 --> 00:14:47,114
And to what do I owe the pleasure
of your carbuncle?

147
00:14:48,365 --> 00:14:49,366
He sent me.

148
00:14:52,036 --> 00:14:53,412
Davy Jones.

149
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,418
So it's you, then.

150
00:15:01,128 --> 00:15:04,340
He shanghaied you into service, eh?

151
00:15:04,506 --> 00:15:05,883
I chose it

152
00:15:06,591 --> 00:15:10,553
I'm sorry for the part I played
in the mutiny against you, Jack.

153
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:14,475
I stood up for you.

154
00:15:14,975 --> 00:15:17,644
Everything went wrong after that.

155
00:15:19,605 --> 00:15:24,235
They strapped me to a cannon.
I ended up on the bottom of the ocean,

156
00:15:24,402 --> 00:15:27,363
the weight of the water
crushing down on me.

157
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:28,990
Unable to move.

158
00:15:30,991 --> 00:15:33,244
Unable to die, Jack.

159
00:15:33,411 --> 00:15:39,000
And I thought that even the tiniest hope
of escaping this fate, I would take it.

160
00:15:39,667 --> 00:15:42,128
I would trade anything for it.

161
00:15:44,004 --> 00:15:47,216
It's funny what a man will do
to forestall his final judgment.

162
00:15:47,383 --> 00:15:49,844
You made a deal with him too, Jack.

163
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:52,596
He raised the <i>Pearl</i>
from the depths for you.

164
00:15:52,763 --> 00:15:54,388
Thirteen years,
you've been her captain.

165
00:15:54,764 --> 00:15:56,017
- Technically-
- Jack.

166
00:15:56,933 --> 00:15:59,311
You won't be able
to talk yourself out of this.

167
00:15:59,477 --> 00:16:02,148
The terms what applied to me
apply to you as well.

168
00:16:02,313 --> 00:16:06,485
One soul bound to crew
a hundred years upon his ship.

169
00:16:06,652 --> 00:16:09,568
Yes, but the <i>Flying</i> Dutchman
already has a captain, so there's really--

170
00:16:09,654 --> 00:16:11,240
Then it's the Locker for you.

171
00:16:11,407 --> 00:16:14,744
Jones's terrible leviathan will find you

172
00:16:14,909 --> 00:16:18,788
and drag the <i>Pearl</i> back to the depths
and you along with it.

173
00:16:20,124 --> 00:16:23,711
Any idea when Jones might release
said terrible beastie?

174
00:16:25,712 --> 00:16:27,590
I already told you, Jack.

175
00:16:29,591 --> 00:16:31,509
The time is up.

176
00:16:32,927 --> 00:16:34,764
It comes now,

177
00:16:34,929 --> 00:16:40,977
drawn with ravenous hunger
to the man what bears the black spot.

178
00:16:49,445 --> 00:16:50,446
On deck, all hands!

179
00:16:50,613 --> 00:16:52,615
Make fast the bunt gasket!

180
00:16:52,782 --> 00:16:54,700
On deck! Scurry!

181
00:16:54,866 --> 00:17:00,498
Scurry. I want movement! Movement.
I want movement! Lift the skin up.

182
00:17:00,831 --> 00:17:02,041
Keep your loof.

183
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,458
Haul those sheets.

184
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:05,752
Run them. Run. Keep running.

185
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,047
Run as if the devil himself
and itself is upon us!

186
00:17:08,213 --> 00:17:10,048
Do we have a heading?

187
00:17:10,215 --> 00:17:11,424
We run. Land.

188
00:17:16,596 --> 00:17:19,557
- Which port?
- I didn't say port. I said land. Any land.

189
00:17:26,648 --> 00:17:29,192
Jack's hat. Clear about.

190
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:30,736
No, no. Leave it.

191
00:17:32,947 --> 00:17:34,490
Run.

192
00:17:36,241 --> 00:17:39,077
Back to your stations, the lot of you!

193
00:17:47,877 --> 00:17:53,134
Jack? For the love of mother and child,
Jack, what's coming after us?

194
00:17:55,176 --> 00:17:56,554
Nothing.

195
00:19:10,336 --> 00:19:11,961
Here, now. You can't be here.

196
00:19:12,128 --> 00:19:13,297
I think you'll find he can.

197
00:19:14,632 --> 00:19:16,090
Mr. Swann.

198
00:19:16,258 --> 00:19:18,219
Governor Swann, still.

199
00:19:18,384 --> 00:19:20,596
Do you think I wear this wig
to keep my head warm?

200
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:25,267
Jack's compass?
What does Beckett want with that?

201
00:19:25,433 --> 00:19:26,809
Does it matter?

202
00:19:26,977 --> 00:19:29,646
I'm to find Jack
and convince him to return to Port Royal.

203
00:19:29,813 --> 00:19:32,191
In exchange, the charges against us
will be dropped.

204
00:19:32,357 --> 00:19:35,903
No. We must find our own avenue
to secure your freedom.

205
00:19:36,069 --> 00:19:38,113
Is that lack of faith in Jack or in me?

206
00:19:38,614 --> 00:19:40,990
That you would risk your life
to save Sparrow's

207
00:19:41,157 --> 00:19:43,993
does not mean that he would do the same
for anyone else.

208
00:19:44,994 --> 00:19:46,579
Now,

209
00:19:46,747 --> 00:19:49,290
where is that dog with the keys?

210
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,251
I have faith in you.

211
00:19:52,627 --> 00:19:54,171
Both of you.

212
00:19:56,798 --> 00:19:58,717
Where will you find him?

213
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,220
Tortuga.

214
00:20:01,386 --> 00:20:04,222
I'll start there and I won't stop searching
till I find him.

215
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:07,017
And then I intend to return here
to marry you.

216
00:20:08,227 --> 00:20:09,228
Properly?

217
00:20:09,394 --> 00:20:11,480
Eagerly, if you'll still have me.

218
00:20:12,605 --> 00:20:14,690
If it weren't for these bars,
I'd have you already.

219
00:20:23,075 --> 00:20:24,367
I'll wait for you.

220
00:20:24,535 --> 00:20:27,496
Keep a weather eye on the horizon.

221
00:20:37,213 --> 00:20:40,049
Captain Jack Sparrow?

222
00:20:40,342 --> 00:20:42,552
Owes me 4 doubloons.

223
00:20:43,595 --> 00:20:44,680
Heard he was dead.

224
00:20:44,846 --> 00:20:46,682
Singapore is what I heard.

225
00:20:46,848 --> 00:20:48,683
Drunk, with a smile on his face.

226
00:20:48,851 --> 00:20:52,980
Sure as the tide,
Jack Sparrow will turn up in Singapore.

227
00:20:53,146 --> 00:20:55,065
Jack Sparrow.

228
00:20:55,231 --> 00:20:57,192
I haven't seen him in a month.

229
00:20:57,358 --> 00:21:01,279
When you find him,
will you give him a message?

230
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,782
Cannot say about Jack Sparrow.

231
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:07,618
But there's a island,
just south of the straits,

232
00:21:07,786 --> 00:21:10,038
where I trade spice

233
00:21:10,538 --> 00:21:13,459
for delicious long pork.

234
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,170
Cannot say about Jack.

235
00:21:16,336 --> 00:21:18,338
But you find a ship there.

236
00:21:18,505 --> 00:21:21,258
A ship with black sails.

237
00:21:28,348 --> 00:21:30,183
My brother will take you ashore.

238
00:21:41,028 --> 00:21:43,489
What's wrong?
The beach is right there.

239
00:21:44,073 --> 00:21:45,531
What?

240
00:22:15,938 --> 00:22:16,939
Jack!

241
00:22:18,606 --> 00:22:21,276
Jack Sparrow!

242
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:28,534
Marty!

243
00:22:29,326 --> 00:22:31,077
Cotton!

244
00:22:32,078 --> 00:22:33,830
Anybody?

245
00:22:40,336 --> 00:22:41,462
A familiar face.

246
00:22:42,131 --> 00:22:43,798
Don't eat me.

247
00:22:43,965 --> 00:22:45,384
I'm not gonna eat you.

248
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:49,596
Don't eat me. No. Don't eat me.

249
00:23:00,606 --> 00:23:02,317
Gibbs.

250
00:23:32,806 --> 00:23:34,807
Come on! Let's go!

251
00:23:37,935 --> 00:23:39,730
Come on! Who wants it?

252
00:23:42,607 --> 00:23:44,902
I could do this all day!

253
00:24:49,298 --> 00:24:50,759
Jack?

254
00:24:50,925 --> 00:24:52,885
Jack Sparrow.

255
00:24:53,511 --> 00:24:55,972
I can honestly say I'm glad to see you.

256
00:25:04,772 --> 00:25:08,693
Jack, it's me. Will Turner.

257
00:25:14,449 --> 00:25:16,910
Tell them to let me down.

258
00:25:27,546 --> 00:25:28,547
Snip, snip.

259
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:37,972
Jack, the compass.

260
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,932
That's all I need. Elizabeth is in danger.

261
00:25:40,099 --> 00:25:41,934
We were arrested for trying to help you.

262
00:25:42,102 --> 00:25:44,813
She faces the gallows!

263
00:25:51,737 --> 00:25:52,738
Savvy?

264
00:26:00,037 --> 00:26:01,329
Save me.

265
00:26:02,497 --> 00:26:03,705
Jack, what did you tell them?

266
00:26:04,665 --> 00:26:06,292
No!

267
00:26:07,251 --> 00:26:09,296
What about Elizabeth?

268
00:26:09,462 --> 00:26:11,173
Jack!

269
00:26:13,549 --> 00:26:15,384
- That's a good girl. Come on.
- Come on now.

270
00:26:15,551 --> 00:26:18,512
- A bit closer.
- We don't bite. Come on.

271
00:26:18,971 --> 00:26:20,682
What is taking your boy?

272
00:26:23,184 --> 00:26:25,854
- Come quickly.
- Where are you going, me lady?

273
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,105
What's happening?

274
00:26:27,271 --> 00:26:29,191
Our name still has some standing
with the King.

275
00:26:29,357 --> 00:26:31,108
I've arranged passage to England.

276
00:26:31,276 --> 00:26:33,487
- The captain is a friend of mine.
- No!

277
00:26:33,653 --> 00:26:34,778
Will is going to find Jack!

278
00:26:34,863 --> 00:26:37,782
We cannot count
on William Turner. Come.

279
00:26:37,949 --> 00:26:39,865
He's a better man
than you give him credit for.

280
00:26:39,951 --> 00:26:44,205
Oh, please. This is no time for innocence.
Beckett has offered one pardon only, one,

281
00:26:44,373 --> 00:26:46,124
and that is promised to Jack Sparrow.

282
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:47,875
Even if Will succeeds,

283
00:26:48,042 --> 00:26:51,712
do not ask me to endure the sight
of my daughter walking to the gallows.

284
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,632
Do not.

285
00:26:54,173 --> 00:26:58,511
Perhaps I can ensure a fair trial
for Will if he returns.

286
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:01,013
A fair trial for Will ends in a hanging.

287
00:27:01,181 --> 00:27:03,767
Then there is nothing left for you here.

288
00:27:10,856 --> 00:27:12,733
Wait inside.

289
00:27:14,193 --> 00:27:15,778
Captain.

290
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:20,200
Captain.

291
00:27:26,455 --> 00:27:28,333
Evening, governor.

292
00:27:28,916 --> 00:27:30,626
Shame, that.

293
00:27:30,961 --> 00:27:33,046
He was carrying this.

294
00:27:33,212 --> 00:27:35,589
It's a letter to the King.

295
00:27:35,965 --> 00:27:36,967
It's from you.

296
00:27:38,468 --> 00:27:40,429
Okay, rank form up to the left.

297
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,390
Elizabeth.

298
00:27:44,641 --> 00:27:46,643
What are you doing?

299
00:27:49,645 --> 00:27:52,356
- Where is she?
- Who?

300
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,045
No doubt you've discovered that loyalty
is no longer the currency of the realm,

301
00:28:14,211 --> 00:28:16,798
as your father believes.

302
00:28:17,298 --> 00:28:19,217
Then what is?

303
00:28:20,176 --> 00:28:23,346
I'm afraid currency
is the currency of the realm.

304
00:28:23,512 --> 00:28:27,933
I expect then that we can come
to some sort of understanding.

305
00:28:28,809 --> 00:28:30,604
I'm here to negotiate.

306
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:32,730
I'm listening.

307
00:28:34,607 --> 00:28:36,817
I'm listening intently.

308
00:28:38,778 --> 00:28:41,155
These letters of marque,
they are signed by the King?

309
00:28:41,615 --> 00:28:45,993
Yes, and they're not valid
until they bear my signature and my seal.

310
00:28:46,161 --> 00:28:47,828
Or else I would not still be here.

311
00:28:48,872 --> 00:28:51,583
You sent Will to get you the compass
owned by Jack Sparrow.

312
00:28:53,042 --> 00:28:54,586
It will do you no good.

313
00:28:55,086 --> 00:28:56,755
Do explain.

314
00:28:56,922 --> 00:29:01,509
I have been to Isla de Muerta,
I have seen the treasure myself.

315
00:29:01,675 --> 00:29:04,054
There is something you need to know.

316
00:29:04,386 --> 00:29:05,931
I see.

317
00:29:06,096 --> 00:29:09,058
You think the compass leads
only to the Isla de Muerta

318
00:29:09,226 --> 00:29:12,354
and so you hope to save me
from an evil fate.

319
00:29:13,104 --> 00:29:15,190
But you mustn't worry.

320
00:29:16,148 --> 00:29:19,402
I care not for cursed Aztec gold.

321
00:29:19,568 --> 00:29:22,029
My desires are not so provincial.

322
00:29:22,823 --> 00:29:27,035
There's more than one chest of value
in these waters.

323
00:29:28,369 --> 00:29:32,707
So perhaps you may wish
to enhance your offer.

324
00:29:34,875 --> 00:29:38,587
Consider into your calculations
that you robbed me of my wedding night.

325
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:41,883
So I did.

326
00:29:43,884 --> 00:29:46,346
A marriage interrupted.

327
00:29:48,515 --> 00:29:51,183
Or fate intervenes

328
00:29:51,893 --> 00:29:55,105
You're making great efforts
to ensure Jack Sparrow's freedom.

329
00:29:55,271 --> 00:29:57,065
- These aren't going to Jack.
- Oh, really?

330
00:29:57,941 --> 00:30:00,652
To ensure Mr. Turner's freedom then?

331
00:30:01,528 --> 00:30:04,239
I'll still want that compass.

332
00:30:04,405 --> 00:30:06,991
Consider that in your calculations.

333
00:30:27,596 --> 00:30:30,723
Well, I say it was divine providence
what escaped us from jail.

334
00:30:30,891 --> 00:30:33,476
And I say it was me being clever.

335
00:30:34,769 --> 00:30:37,271
Ain't that right, poochie?

336
00:30:37,439 --> 00:30:41,526
Well, how did you know it weren't divine
providence what inspired you to be clever?

337
00:30:41,692 --> 00:30:43,862
Anyways, I ain't stealing no ship.

338
00:30:44,028 --> 00:30:47,449
It ain't stealing. It's salvaging.

339
00:30:47,615 --> 00:30:51,368
- And since when did you care?
- Since we're not immortal no more.

340
00:30:51,536 --> 00:30:53,954
We gotta take care of our immortal souls.

341
00:30:54,122 --> 00:30:55,289
You know you can't read.

342
00:30:55,789 --> 00:30:57,834
It's the Bible. You get credit for trying.

343
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,546
Pretending to read the Bible's a lie!

344
00:31:01,712 --> 00:31:04,048
That's a mark against:

345
00:31:05,215 --> 00:31:06,384
Look.

346
00:31:07,009 --> 00:31:09,095
There it is.

347
00:31:13,892 --> 00:31:15,268
What's got into him?

348
00:31:15,935 --> 00:31:18,313
Must have seen a catfish.

349
00:31:25,028 --> 00:31:26,237
Stupid mongrel!

350
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:32,035
You want me to prove it,
give it back to me.

351
00:31:32,201 --> 00:31:34,496
All right! All right!

352
00:31:43,171 --> 00:31:44,172
Come on!

353
00:31:52,388 --> 00:31:54,223
It's ours for the taking.

354
00:31:54,391 --> 00:31:56,518
Tide's coming in, that should help.

355
00:31:56,684 --> 00:31:59,479
Well, salvaging is saving,
in a manner of speaking.

356
00:31:59,645 --> 00:32:01,397
There's the truth of it.

357
00:32:09,071 --> 00:32:11,865
I suppose we better save it
as soon as we can,

358
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:15,202
what with our souls
in such a vulnerable state and all.

359
00:32:15,369 --> 00:32:17,329
Amen to that.

360
00:32:34,138 --> 00:32:35,723
Thank you.

361
00:32:53,115 --> 00:32:54,867
Why would he do this to us?

362
00:32:55,035 --> 00:32:56,326
If Jack is the chief--

363
00:32:56,493 --> 00:32:58,872
Aye, the Pelegostos made Jack
their chief.

364
00:32:59,038 --> 00:33:02,541
But he only remains chief
as long as he acts like a chief.

365
00:33:02,709 --> 00:33:04,001
So he had no choice.

366
00:33:04,169 --> 00:33:06,046
He's a captive then
as much as the rest of us.

367
00:33:06,211 --> 00:33:07,713
Worse as it turns out.

368
00:33:08,213 --> 00:33:12,594
See, the Pelegostos believe
that Jack is a god in human form

369
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:17,265
and they intend to do him the honour
of releasing him from his fleshy prison.

370
00:33:22,394 --> 00:33:24,772
They'll roast him and eat him.

371
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,608
Where's the rest of the crew?

372
00:33:27,776 --> 00:33:32,279
These cages we're in weren't built
till after we got here.

373
00:33:34,656 --> 00:33:36,785
The feast is about to begin.

374
00:33:37,367 --> 00:33:39,578
Jack's life will end

375
00:33:39,746 --> 00:33:42,207
when the drums stop.

376
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:46,336
Well, we can't just sit here
and wait then, can we?

377
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,381
No, no.

378
00:33:50,548 --> 00:33:52,217
No, no. More wood.

379
00:33:52,383 --> 00:33:54,676
Big fire. Big fire.

380
00:33:54,844 --> 00:33:58,640
I am chief. Want big fire. Come on.

381
00:34:02,769 --> 00:34:05,145
Come on. More wood.

382
00:35:13,547 --> 00:35:15,215
Oh, bugger.

383
00:35:25,226 --> 00:35:27,644
Little seasoning, eh?

384
00:35:41,034 --> 00:35:42,702
Well done.

385
00:36:22,157 --> 00:36:24,409
Put your legs through, start to climb!

386
00:36:26,536 --> 00:36:30,625
Come on, men. It'll take all of us
to crew the Black Pearl.

387
00:36:30,791 --> 00:36:33,543
Actually, you wouldn't need everyone.

388
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:36,338
About six would do.

389
00:36:39,592 --> 00:36:41,302
Oh, dear.

390
00:36:44,847 --> 00:36:46,056
- Hurry!
- Come on, boys!

391
00:36:46,224 --> 00:36:47,391
Come on, go! Go!

392
00:36:51,144 --> 00:36:53,563
Come on! Is that all you got?

393
00:36:59,403 --> 00:37:01,030
- Hey.
- To the top!

394
00:37:01,197 --> 00:37:02,197
- First--
- Wait. Stop.

395
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,784
<i>_ stop-
_ stop-</i>

396
00:37:18,588 --> 00:37:21,050
- What are they doing?
- Stop.

397
00:37:21,925 --> 00:37:24,052
Stop. Stop.

398
00:37:27,806 --> 00:37:29,516
Snake.

399
00:37:38,775 --> 00:37:40,235
Oh, no.

400
00:37:47,034 --> 00:37:48,786
- Move!
- Come on, boys!

401
00:38:15,103 --> 00:38:17,190
Well, go on. Go get them.

402
00:38:22,778 --> 00:38:26,114
No, no.

403
00:38:27,449 --> 00:38:28,992
Not good.

404
00:38:45,342 --> 00:38:47,512
Cut it loose! Find a rock!

405
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:09,074
- Roll the cage!
- Come on.

406
00:39:14,746 --> 00:39:16,416
No!

407
00:39:35,309 --> 00:39:36,893
Lift the cage! Hurry!

408
00:39:37,061 --> 00:39:40,231
Come on, lads! Lift it like a lady's skirt!

409
00:39:45,068 --> 00:39:47,405
Come on!

410
00:40:51,594 --> 00:40:53,721
This way, lads!

411
00:41:16,409 --> 00:41:17,411
Take cover!

412
00:41:19,246 --> 00:41:21,039
Stop it!

413
00:42:16,219 --> 00:42:17,597
Bugger

414
00:42:45,206 --> 00:42:50,630
Haul loose the mooring line!
The mooring line!

415
00:42:50,795 --> 00:42:53,965
Thief! Little hairy thief! Give it back!

416
00:42:54,132 --> 00:42:57,302
- Don't bite it!
- Haul loose the mooring line!

417
00:42:57,802 --> 00:43:00,014
He's got me eye. He won't give it back.

418
00:43:00,181 --> 00:43:03,516
- Well, how'd you get it back last time?
- Excellent! Our work's half done.

419
00:43:03,684 --> 00:43:06,186
We done it for you,
knowing you'd be coming back for it.

420
00:43:06,353 --> 00:43:07,980
Make ready to sail, boys!

421
00:43:08,146 --> 00:43:10,398
What about Jack?
I won't leave without him.

422
00:43:20,659 --> 00:43:21,827
Time to go.

423
00:43:21,994 --> 00:43:23,621
Cast off those lines!

424
00:43:32,463 --> 00:43:34,172
Make ready to cast off!

425
00:43:38,927 --> 00:43:40,762
Good doggy-

426
00:43:56,737 --> 00:44:00,240
Alas, my children, this is the day
you shall always remember

427
00:44:00,407 --> 00:44:02,909
as the day that you almost--

428
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:08,373
Captain Jack Sparrow.

429
00:44:34,190 --> 00:44:37,402
Let's put some distance between us
and this island and head out to open sea.

430
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:39,070
Yes to the first. Yes to the second,

431
00:44:39,155 --> 00:44:41,907
but only insofar as we keep
to the shallows as much as possible.

432
00:44:42,074 --> 00:44:43,992
That seems a bit contradictory, captain.

433
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:47,329
I have every faith in your reconciliatory
navigational skills, Master Gibbs.

434
00:44:47,496 --> 00:44:50,458
Now, where is that monkey?
I want to shoot something.

435
00:44:56,045 --> 00:44:58,382
Jack. Elizabeth is in danger.

436
00:44:58,548 --> 00:45:00,298
Have you considered keeping
a watchful eye?

437
00:45:00,384 --> 00:45:02,853
- Just lock her up somewhere.
- She is locked up in a prison,

438
00:45:02,927 --> 00:45:04,177
bound to hang for helping you.

439
00:45:04,262 --> 00:45:08,434
There comes a time when one must
take responsibility for one's mistakes.

440
00:45:10,478 --> 00:45:12,730
I need that compass of yours, Jack.

441
00:45:12,896 --> 00:45:14,231
I must trade it for her freedom.

442
00:45:17,735 --> 00:45:20,278
- Mr. Gibbs.
- Captain.

443
00:45:20,445 --> 00:45:22,572
We have a need to travel upriver.

444
00:45:23,657 --> 00:45:27,036
By need, do you mean a trifling need?

445
00:45:27,202 --> 00:45:30,914
Fleeting? As in, say, a passing fancy?

446
00:45:31,081 --> 00:45:34,835
No, a resolute and unyielding need.

447
00:45:35,001 --> 00:45:38,713
What we need to do
is make sail for Port Royal with all haste.

448
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,590
William,

449
00:45:40,925 --> 00:45:47,556
I shall trade you the compass
if you will help me to find this.

450
00:45:50,768 --> 00:45:53,896
- You want me to find this?
- No.

451
00:45:54,396 --> 00:45:56,773
You want you to find this,

452
00:45:56,940 --> 00:46:01,027
because the finding of this
finds you incapacitorially finding

453
00:46:01,195 --> 00:46:03,947
and/or locating in your discovering
the detecting of a way

454
00:46:04,114 --> 00:46:08,577
to save your dolly belle,
ol' what's-her-face. Savvy?

455
00:46:12,289 --> 00:46:14,750
This is going to save Elizabeth?

456
00:46:17,168 --> 00:46:20,130
How much do you know
about Davy Jones?

457
00:46:22,298 --> 00:46:23,300
Not much.

458
00:46:24,134 --> 00:46:27,012
Yeah, it's gonna save Elizabeth.

459
00:46:53,371 --> 00:46:55,498
What's all this?

460
00:46:56,666 --> 00:47:01,630
If you both fancy the dress, you'll just have
to share and wear it one after the other.

461
00:47:01,838 --> 00:47:03,673
No, it's not like that, sir.

462
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:05,009
This ship is haunted.

463
00:47:05,634 --> 00:47:07,927
Is it, now? And you?

464
00:47:08,094 --> 00:47:12,099
There's a female presence
amongst us here, sir.

465
00:47:12,266 --> 00:47:14,559
- All the men, they can feel it.
- Aye.

466
00:47:14,726 --> 00:47:18,480
It's the ghost of a lady widowed
before her marriage, I figure it,

467
00:47:18,646 --> 00:47:20,858
searching for her husband, lost at sea.

468
00:47:21,025 --> 00:47:22,693
A virgin too, likely as not.

469
00:47:23,568 --> 00:47:25,695
And that bodes ill by all accounts.

470
00:47:25,862 --> 00:47:30,451
I say that we throw the dress overboard
and we hope the spirit follows it.

471
00:47:30,617 --> 00:47:33,579
No! That will just anger the spirit, sir.

472
00:47:33,746 --> 00:47:36,005
What we need to do
is to find out what the spirit needs,

473
00:47:36,081 --> 00:47:37,625
and then just get it back to her.

474
00:47:37,791 --> 00:47:39,918
Enough! Enough!

475
00:47:40,085 --> 00:47:42,922
You're a pair of superstitious goats
and it's got the best of you.

476
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:47,592
Now, this appears to be no more
as we have a stowaway on board.

477
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,344
A young woman, by the look of it.

478
00:47:49,844 --> 00:47:51,804
I want you to search the ship
and find her.

479
00:47:52,597 --> 00:47:55,309
Oh, and she's probably naked.

480
00:48:25,297 --> 00:48:27,840
Why is Jack afraid of the open ocean?

481
00:48:28,007 --> 00:48:30,302
Well, if you believe such things,

482
00:48:30,844 --> 00:48:33,554
there's a beast does the bidding
of Davy Jones.

483
00:48:33,722 --> 00:48:38,268
A fearsome creature with giant tentacles
that'll suction your face clean off

484
00:48:38,434 --> 00:48:41,981
and drag an entire ship
down to the crushing darkness.

485
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:44,692
The Kraken.

486
00:48:48,112 --> 00:48:51,364
They say the stench of its breath is...

487
00:48:52,074 --> 00:48:55,661
Imagine, the last thing you know
on God's green earth

488
00:48:55,827 --> 00:48:57,704
is the roar of the Kraken

489
00:48:57,871 --> 00:49:01,583
and the reeking odour
of a thousand rotting corpses.

490
00:49:03,501 --> 00:49:05,963
If you believe such things.

491
00:49:06,547 --> 00:49:08,423
And the key will spare him that?

492
00:49:09,048 --> 00:49:12,469
Well, that's the very question
Jack wants answered.

493
00:49:12,677 --> 00:49:16,849
Bad enough even to go visit her.

494
00:49:18,307 --> 00:49:19,893
Her?

495
00:49:20,268 --> 00:49:21,978
Aye.

496
00:49:57,264 --> 00:49:58,849
No worries, mates.

497
00:49:59,016 --> 00:50:00,893
Tia Dalma and I go way back.

498
00:50:01,059 --> 00:50:02,351
Thick as thieves.

499
00:50:02,518 --> 00:50:04,938
Nigh inseparable, we are.

500
00:50:05,105 --> 00:50:06,231
Were.

501
00:50:06,398 --> 00:50:08,067
Have been.

502
00:50:08,567 --> 00:50:09,610
Before.

503
00:50:09,777 --> 00:50:12,612
- I'll watch your back.
- It's me front I'm worried about.

504
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:15,907
Mind the boat.

505
00:50:16,115 --> 00:50:18,577
- Mind the boat.
- Mind the boat.

506
00:50:18,744 --> 00:50:19,952
Mind the boat.

507
00:50:20,913 --> 00:50:22,914
Mind the boat.

508
00:50:34,885 --> 00:50:37,387
Jack Sparrow.

509
00:50:38,262 --> 00:50:40,389
Tia Dalma.

510
00:50:41,224 --> 00:50:45,686
I always know the wind was going blow
you back to me one day.

511
00:50:50,525 --> 00:50:52,318
You.

512
00:50:54,822 --> 00:51:02,788
You have a touch of destiny about you,
William Turner.

513
00:51:04,539 --> 00:51:06,333
You know me?

514
00:51:06,958 --> 00:51:09,503
You want to know me.

515
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:11,130
There'll be no knowing here.

516
00:51:11,295 --> 00:51:14,132
We've come for help
and we're not leaving without it.

517
00:51:14,298 --> 00:51:15,550
I thought I knew you.

518
00:51:15,717 --> 00:51:18,679
Not so well as I had hoped. Come.

519
00:51:18,846 --> 00:51:20,556
Come.

520
00:51:23,934 --> 00:51:29,021
What service may I do you?

521
00:51:29,188 --> 00:51:30,565
You know I demand payment.

522
00:51:30,731 --> 00:51:33,025
I brought payment.

523
00:51:36,737 --> 00:51:38,197
Look.

524
00:51:39,867 --> 00:51:41,367
An undead monkey.

525
00:51:42,327 --> 00:51:44,163
Top that.

526
00:51:48,125 --> 00:51:49,585
No.

527
00:51:49,751 --> 00:51:52,336
You've no idea how long it took us
to catch that.

528
00:51:52,503 --> 00:51:55,340
The payment is fair.

529
00:51:55,507 --> 00:51:57,342
We're looking for this.

530
00:52:00,052 --> 00:52:01,722
And what it goes to.

531
00:52:04,224 --> 00:52:08,853
The compass you bartered from me,
it cannot lead you to this?

532
00:52:09,021 --> 00:52:10,188
Maybe.

533
00:52:11,231 --> 00:52:12,356
Why?

534
00:52:12,523 --> 00:52:14,650
Aye.

535
00:52:14,818 --> 00:52:19,322
Jack Sparrow does not know
what he wants.

536
00:52:20,032 --> 00:52:26,246
Or do you know,
but are loathe to claim it as your own.

537
00:52:28,081 --> 00:52:30,041
Your key go to a chest

538
00:52:30,708 --> 00:52:35,172
and it is what lay inside the chest
you seek, don't it?

539
00:52:35,338 --> 00:52:39,550
- What is inside?
- Gold? Jewels?

540
00:52:39,717 --> 00:52:42,346
Unclaimed properties
of a valuable nature?

541
00:52:42,512 --> 00:52:45,556
Nothing bad, I hope.

542
00:52:46,432 --> 00:52:50,811
You know of Davy Jones, yes?

543
00:52:50,978 --> 00:52:53,648
A man of the sea.

544
00:52:53,815 --> 00:53:01,197
A great sailor until he ran afoul of that
which vex all men.

545
00:53:01,364 --> 00:53:03,909
What vexes all men?

546
00:53:05,911 --> 00:53:08,288
What indeed.

547
00:53:08,914 --> 00:53:10,916
- The sea?
- Sums.

548
00:53:11,083 --> 00:53:12,793
The dichotomy of good and evil.

549
00:53:14,670 --> 00:53:16,713
A woman.

550
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,632
A woman. He fell in love.

551
00:53:20,509 --> 00:53:23,427
No, no, no. I heard it was the sea
he fell in love with.

552
00:53:23,594 --> 00:53:27,516
Same story, different versions,
and all are true.

553
00:53:27,682 --> 00:53:36,233
See, it was a woman, as changing,
and harsh, and untameable as the sea.

554
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,735
Him never stopped loving her.

555
00:53:38,902 --> 00:53:43,572
But the pain it cause him
was too much to live with.

556
00:53:43,739 --> 00:53:46,409
But not enough to cause him to die.

557
00:53:48,244 --> 00:53:52,581
What exactly did he put into the chest?

558
00:53:52,748 --> 00:53:54,668
Him heart.

559
00:53:54,835 --> 00:53:57,045
Literally or figuratively?

560
00:53:57,211 --> 00:54:00,882
He couldn't literally put his heart
in a chest.

561
00:54:01,590 --> 00:54:03,342
Could he?

562
00:54:03,719 --> 00:54:09,766
It was not worth feeling
what small fleeting joy life brings.

563
00:54:09,932 --> 00:54:14,271
And so him carved out him heart,

564
00:54:14,938 --> 00:54:20,402
lock it away in a chest,
and hide the chest from the world.

565
00:54:20,568 --> 00:54:22,403
The key,

566
00:54:22,612 --> 00:54:25,657
he keep with him at all times.

567
00:54:27,867 --> 00:54:29,702
- You knew this.
- I did not.

568
00:54:29,869 --> 00:54:32,706
I didn't know where the key was.
But now we do.

569
00:54:32,873 --> 00:54:35,250
So all that's left is to climb aboard
the Flying Dutchman,

570
00:54:35,416 --> 00:54:38,711
grab the key, you go back to Port Royal,
and save your bonnie lass, eh?

571
00:54:38,878 --> 00:54:40,588
Let me see your hand.

572
00:54:55,686 --> 00:54:57,646
The black spot.

573
00:54:59,565 --> 00:55:00,942
- Black spot.
- Black spot.

574
00:55:02,693 --> 00:55:05,822
My eyesight's as good as ever,
just so you know.

575
00:55:06,447 --> 00:55:09,326
I have just the thing.
Now, where did I put it'?

576
00:55:09,492 --> 00:55:11,994
Must be here somewhere.

577
00:55:12,621 --> 00:55:16,248
My little beauty, where are you?

578
00:55:16,416 --> 00:55:18,918
It's been such a long time
in such a mess.

579
00:55:22,088 --> 00:55:24,800
Davy Jones cannot make port.

580
00:55:24,965 --> 00:55:28,219
Cannot step on land,
but once every ten years.

581
00:55:28,929 --> 00:55:31,597
Land is where you are safe,
Jack Sparrow.

582
00:55:32,099 --> 00:55:34,643
And so you will carry land with you.

583
00:55:43,943 --> 00:55:45,653
Dirt.

584
00:55:47,114 --> 00:55:48,739
This is a jar of dirt.

585
00:55:49,199 --> 00:55:50,659
Yes?

586
00:55:53,077 --> 00:55:55,956
Is the jar of dirt going to help?

587
00:55:56,123 --> 00:55:58,958
If you don't want it, give it back.

588
00:55:59,543 --> 00:56:00,626
No.

589
00:56:01,293 --> 00:56:02,628
Then it helps.

590
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:08,844
It seems we have a need
to find the <i>Flying</i> Dutchman.

591
00:56:13,014 --> 00:56:17,853
A touch of destiny.

592
00:56:32,367 --> 00:56:33,827
<i>That's the Flying Dutchman?</i>

593
00:56:36,663 --> 00:56:39,541
- She doesn't look like much.
- Neither do you.

594
00:56:39,708 --> 00:56:42,460
Do not underestimate her.

595
00:56:43,545 --> 00:56:45,172
Must have run afoul of the reef.

596
00:56:45,338 --> 00:56:47,507
So, what's your plan, then?

597
00:56:48,048 --> 00:56:51,344
I row over, search the ship
until I find your bloody key.

598
00:56:51,510 --> 00:56:53,637
And if there are crewmen?

599
00:56:54,014 --> 00:56:56,891
I cut down anyone in my path.

600
00:56:57,099 --> 00:56:59,978
I like it. Simple, easy to remember.

601
00:57:00,144 --> 00:57:03,023
Your chariot awaits you, sire!

602
00:57:07,610 --> 00:57:09,445
If you do happen to get captured,

603
00:57:09,612 --> 00:57:13,240
just say Jack Sparrow sent you
to settle his debt.

604
00:57:13,407 --> 00:57:14,659
Might save your life.

605
00:57:14,826 --> 00:57:17,286
Bon voyage!

606
00:57:21,373 --> 00:57:23,501
Douse the lamps.

607
00:58:01,623 --> 00:58:05,376
Hoist jib. Bring up with a round turn.
Captain's orders.

608
00:58:05,543 --> 00:58:08,255
- Sailor.
- Hoist the innerjib. Captain's orders.

609
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:09,422
Sailor!

610
00:58:09,588 --> 00:58:11,715
Hoisting the jib.
Bring up a round turn.

611
00:58:11,882 --> 00:58:13,717
There's no use. You've run aground.

612
00:58:14,635 --> 00:58:15,971
No.

613
00:58:16,137 --> 00:58:17,931
Beneath us.

614
00:58:19,139 --> 00:58:20,349
Foul breath.

615
00:58:34,114 --> 00:58:36,574
Hey! Hey!

616
00:59:14,153 --> 00:59:16,905
Down on your marrowbones and pray.

617
00:59:31,963 --> 00:59:33,380
Get back!

618
00:59:34,048 --> 00:59:35,759
Back!

619
01:00:07,414 --> 01:00:11,210
Five men still alive.
The rest have moved on.

620
01:00:28,228 --> 01:00:32,106
Do you fear death?

621
01:00:32,731 --> 01:00:38,362
Do you fear that dark abyss?

622
01:00:39,530 --> 01:00:43,034
All your deeds laid bare.

623
01:00:43,242 --> 01:00:46,829
All your sins punished.

624
01:00:48,039 --> 01:00:52,835
I can offer you an escape.

625
01:00:53,253 --> 01:00:54,753
Don't listen to him!

626
01:01:04,889 --> 01:01:08,643
Do you not fear death?

627
01:01:10,436 --> 01:01:11,938
I'll take my chances, sir.

628
01:01:13,021 --> 01:01:14,231
To the depths.

629
01:01:20,864 --> 01:01:21,905
Cruel blackguard!

630
01:01:23,115 --> 01:01:25,827
Life is cruel.

631
01:01:26,161 --> 01:01:28,829
Why should the afterlife
be any different?

632
01:01:29,289 --> 01:01:32,541
I offer you a choice.

633
01:01:32,708 --> 01:01:37,797
Join my crew
and postpone the judgment.

634
01:01:39,257 --> 01:01:43,510
One hundred years before the mast.

635
01:01:45,012 --> 01:01:46,931
Will ye serve?

636
01:01:48,849 --> 01:01:50,768
I will serve.

637
01:01:50,934 --> 01:01:52,936
There.

638
01:02:00,195 --> 01:02:03,572
You are neither dead nor dying.

639
01:02:03,739 --> 01:02:05,324
What is your purpose here?

640
01:02:09,204 --> 01:02:11,789
Jack Sparrow sent me
to settle his debt.

641
01:02:13,625 --> 01:02:15,335
What is your purpose here?

642
01:02:16,835 --> 01:02:20,798
Jack Sparrow sent me
to settle his debt.

643
01:02:22,967 --> 01:02:25,302
Did he, now?

644
01:02:25,719 --> 01:02:29,056
I'm sorely tempted to accept that offer.

645
01:02:45,989 --> 01:02:48,742
You have a debt to pay.

646
01:02:48,909 --> 01:02:52,454
You've been captain of the <i>Black Pearl</i>
for 13 years.

647
01:02:52,621 --> 01:02:54,456
That was our agreement.

648
01:02:54,623 --> 01:02:56,751
Technically I was only captain
for two years,

649
01:02:56,918 --> 01:02:58,376
then I was viciously mutinied upon.

650
01:02:58,460 --> 01:03:02,215
Then you were a poor captain,
but a captain nonetheless.

651
01:03:02,382 --> 01:03:09,347
Have you not introduced yourself
all these years as Captain Jack Sparrow?

652
01:03:11,224 --> 01:03:14,318
You have my payment. One soul to serve
on your ship. He's already over there.

653
01:03:14,393 --> 01:03:16,813
One soul is not equal to another.

654
01:03:17,605 --> 01:03:19,699
We've established my proposal
is sound in principle.

655
01:03:19,773 --> 01:03:21,650
Now we're just haggling over price.

656
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:26,322
Price?

657
01:03:28,907 --> 01:03:32,327
Just how many souls
do you think my soul is worth?

658
01:03:36,123 --> 01:03:39,501
One hundred souls.

659
01:03:39,793 --> 01:03:41,461
Three days.

660
01:03:41,963 --> 01:03:43,338
You're a diamond, mate.

661
01:03:43,505 --> 01:03:45,884
Send me back the boy.
I'll get started right off.

662
01:03:46,050 --> 01:03:49,262
I keep the boy. A good-faith payment.

663
01:03:49,429 --> 01:03:52,681
That leaves you only 99 more to go.

664
01:03:54,934 --> 01:03:56,768
Have you not met Will Turner?

665
01:03:56,936 --> 01:03:59,771
He's noble, heroic, terrific soprano.

666
01:03:59,938 --> 01:04:01,983
Worth at least four.

667
01:04:02,358 --> 01:04:04,360
Maybe three and a half.

668
01:04:05,445 --> 01:04:08,114
And did I happen to mention...

669
01:04:08,530 --> 01:04:10,617
he's in love'?

670
01:04:11,784 --> 01:04:13,744
With a girl.

671
01:04:14,536 --> 01:04:16,873
Due to be married.

672
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:19,250
Betroth ed.

673
01:04:20,001 --> 01:04:24,672
Dividing him from her and her from him
would only be half as cruel

674
01:04:24,838 --> 01:04:30,552
as actually allowing them
to be joined in holy matrimony, eh'?

675
01:04:33,597 --> 01:04:38,436
I keep the boy. Ninety-nine souls.

676
01:04:38,603 --> 01:04:43,483
But I wonder, Sparrow,
can you live with this?

677
01:04:44,233 --> 01:04:48,028
Can you condemn an innocent man,
a friend,

678
01:04:48,195 --> 01:04:53,952
to a lifetime of servitude in your name
while you roam free?

679
01:04:56,371 --> 01:04:58,331
Yep. I'm good with it.

680
01:04:58,498 --> 01:05:01,626
Shall we seal it in blood? I mean, ink?

681
01:05:05,963 --> 01:05:08,632
Three days.

682
01:05:13,012 --> 01:05:16,556
Three days.

683
01:05:23,188 --> 01:05:25,817
- Mr. Gibbs.
- Aye.

684
01:05:25,983 --> 01:05:28,527
I feel sullied and unusual.

685
01:05:28,695 --> 01:05:34,324
And how do you intend to harvest
these 99 souls in three days?

686
01:05:34,492 --> 01:05:36,786
Fortunately,
he was mum as to the condition

687
01:05:36,952 --> 01:05:39,914
in which these souls need be.

688
01:05:40,664 --> 01:05:42,500
Tortuga.

689
01:05:43,751 --> 01:05:45,085
Tortuga.

690
01:05:49,215 --> 01:05:50,465
It's an outrage.

691
01:05:50,632 --> 01:05:56,139
Port tariffs, berthing fees, wharf handling
and, heaven help us, pilotage.

692
01:05:56,304 --> 01:05:58,807
Are we all to work
for the East India Trading Company, then?

693
01:06:00,684 --> 01:06:05,063
I'm afraid, sir, Tortuga is the only free port
left in these waters.

694
01:06:05,231 --> 01:06:06,773
A pirate port is what you mean.

695
01:06:06,940 --> 01:06:09,402
Well, I'm sorry.
An honest sailor is what I am.

696
01:06:09,568 --> 01:06:13,072
I make my living fair
and I sleep well each night, thank you.

697
01:06:14,157 --> 01:06:15,949
Sir.

698
01:06:39,139 --> 01:06:41,809
She wants you to do something.

699
01:06:44,978 --> 01:06:47,273
She's trying to give a sign.

700
01:06:56,074 --> 01:06:59,117
Over there. Look for a sign.

701
01:07:03,371 --> 01:07:05,458
Look, there. There it is.

702
01:07:05,958 --> 01:07:08,460
- There's the sign.
- That's seaweed.

703
01:07:08,628 --> 01:07:11,630
- Seaweed can be a sign.
- Looks like entrails.

704
01:07:11,797 --> 01:07:12,882
That would be a bad sign.

705
01:07:13,048 --> 01:07:15,175
What's that over there?

706
01:07:25,103 --> 01:07:28,773
Have mercy, will you?

707
01:07:35,237 --> 01:07:38,324
And what makes you think
you're worthy to crew the <i>Black Pearl?</i>

708
01:07:38,490 --> 01:07:40,659
Truth be told,
I've never sailed a day in me life.

709
01:07:40,827 --> 01:07:43,954
I figure I should get out, see the world
while I'm still young.

710
01:07:44,121 --> 01:07:45,706
You'll do. Make your mark.

711
01:07:46,123 --> 01:07:47,375
Next.

712
01:07:47,541 --> 01:07:53,047
My wife ran off with my dog
and I'm drunk for a month

713
01:07:53,213 --> 01:07:57,342
and I don't give an ass rat's
if I live or die.

714
01:07:57,510 --> 01:08:01,222
- Perfect. Next.
- I know what I want. I know what I want.

715
01:08:01,389 --> 01:08:02,931
Me have one arm and a bum leg.

716
01:08:03,099 --> 01:08:04,641
It's the crow's nest for you.

717
01:08:04,809 --> 01:08:06,853
- I know what I want.
- Next.

718
01:08:07,018 --> 01:08:09,146
Ever since I was a little lad,

719
01:08:09,313 --> 01:08:12,608
I've always wanted
to sail the seas. Forever.

720
01:08:12,775 --> 01:08:15,402
Sooner than you think. Sign the roster.

721
01:08:15,570 --> 01:08:16,863
Thanks very much.

722
01:08:17,904 --> 01:08:22,993
- How we going?
- Including those four, that gives us four.

723
01:08:26,497 --> 01:08:28,623
And what's your story?

724
01:08:28,832 --> 01:08:31,168
My story

725
01:08:31,377 --> 01:08:35,922
It's exactly the same as your story,
just one chapter behind.

726
01:08:36,591 --> 01:08:39,886
I chased a man across the seven seas.

727
01:08:40,219 --> 01:08:45,390
The pursuit cost me my crew,
my commission,

728
01:08:45,932 --> 01:08:47,894
and my life.

729
01:08:53,106 --> 01:08:56,319
- Commodore?
- No, not any more. Weren't you listening?

730
01:09:00,948 --> 01:09:03,451
I nearly had you all off Tripoli.

731
01:09:04,284 --> 01:09:05,828
I would have,

732
01:09:05,994 --> 01:09:08,706
if not for the hurricane.

733
01:09:08,872 --> 01:09:12,292
Lord. You didn't try to sail through it.

734
01:09:12,460 --> 01:09:16,796
So do I make your crew or not?

735
01:09:18,006 --> 01:09:20,717
You haven't said where you're going.

736
01:09:20,885 --> 01:09:22,802
Somewhere nice?

737
01:09:23,845 --> 01:09:29,143
So am I worthy to serve
under Captain Jack Sparrow?

738
01:09:31,686 --> 01:09:33,480
Or should I just kill you now?

739
01:09:41,197 --> 01:09:42,280
You're hired.

740
01:09:43,490 --> 01:09:45,033
Sorry.

741
01:09:45,201 --> 01:09:46,911
Old habits and all that.

742
01:09:47,078 --> 01:09:50,372
- Easy, sailor!
- That's our captain you're threatening.

743
01:10:04,345 --> 01:10:06,555
- Time to go.
- Aye.

744
01:10:50,975 --> 01:10:52,435
Thanks, mate.

745
01:10:58,690 --> 01:11:00,192
Carry on.

746
01:11:07,908 --> 01:11:09,034
Come on, then.

747
01:11:09,201 --> 01:11:10,368
Who wants some?

748
01:11:10,536 --> 01:11:13,956
Form an orderly line.
I'll have you all, one by one.

749
01:11:14,122 --> 01:11:16,542
Come on, who's first?

750
01:11:19,127 --> 01:11:21,463
I just wanted the pleasure
of doing that myself.

751
01:11:30,972 --> 01:11:33,016
I've never liked him.

752
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:51,409
James Norrington.

753
01:11:52,828 --> 01:11:55,206
What has the world done to you?

754
01:12:24,068 --> 01:12:26,237
Heave!

755
01:12:26,487 --> 01:12:28,613
Heave!

756
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:31,951
Heave!

757
01:12:34,619 --> 01:12:37,997
- Heave!
- Heave-ho!

758
01:12:41,042 --> 01:12:44,963
Secure the mast tackle, Mr. Turner.

759
01:12:48,259 --> 01:12:50,136
Get to it!

760
01:12:55,432 --> 01:12:57,810
- Step aside.
- Hey, mind yourself.

761
01:12:57,976 --> 01:13:00,938
- Hey!
- Let go, boy.

762
01:13:03,690 --> 01:13:04,733
No.

763
01:13:13,993 --> 01:13:16,537
Haul that weevil to his feet.

764
01:13:21,750 --> 01:13:26,212
- Five lashes to remind you to stay on her.
- No.

765
01:13:26,963 --> 01:13:30,842
Impeding me in my duties?

766
01:13:31,010 --> 01:13:33,429
You'll share the punishment.

767
01:13:33,595 --> 01:13:34,721
I'll take it all.

768
01:13:34,889 --> 01:13:37,140
Will you now?

769
01:13:37,307 --> 01:13:42,479
And what would prompt
such an act of charity?

770
01:13:46,192 --> 01:13:48,152
My son.

771
01:13:53,073 --> 01:13:54,283
He's my son.

772
01:14:06,712 --> 01:14:09,965
What fortuitous circumstance be this.

773
01:14:10,131 --> 01:14:14,511
Five lashes be owed, I believe it is.

774
01:14:18,765 --> 01:14:21,351
No. No, I won't.

775
01:14:21,519 --> 01:14:24,188
The cat's out of the bag, Mr. Turner.

776
01:14:24,688 --> 01:14:30,069
Your issue will feel its sting,
be it by the boatswain's hand or your own.

777
01:14:33,322 --> 01:14:34,614
No, no.

778
01:14:36,492 --> 01:14:38,911
- Boatswain!
- No!

779
01:15:22,704 --> 01:15:26,000
You had it easy, boy.

780
01:15:26,166 --> 01:15:29,587
- William.
- I don't need your help.

781
01:15:30,921 --> 01:15:34,173
The boatswain prides himself
on cleaving flesh from bone

782
01:15:34,341 --> 01:15:36,594
with every swing.

783
01:15:37,344 --> 01:15:40,680
So I'm to understand what you did
was an act of compassion.

784
01:15:42,307 --> 01:15:43,350
Yes.

785
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:56,195
One hundred years before the mast,
losing your world bit by bit,

786
01:15:56,363 --> 01:15:59,824
until you end up like poor Wyvern here.

787
01:16:02,118 --> 01:16:05,913
Once you've sworn an oath
to the Dutchman, there's no leaving it.

788
01:16:06,164 --> 01:16:08,042
Not until your debt is paid.

789
01:16:09,417 --> 01:16:10,752
I've sworn no oath.

790
01:16:13,546 --> 01:16:14,631
Then you must get away.

791
01:16:17,134 --> 01:16:18,844
Not until I find this.

792
01:16:20,554 --> 01:16:22,180
The key.

793
01:16:29,688 --> 01:16:31,981
The dead man's chest.

794
01:16:33,192 --> 01:16:34,484
What do you know of this?

795
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:40,032
Open the chest with the key
and stab the heart.

796
01:16:40,198 --> 01:16:43,327
No, no, no. Don't stab the heart.

797
01:16:43,493 --> 01:16:48,457
The Dutchman needs a living heart
or there'll be no captain.

798
01:16:48,623 --> 01:16:52,836
And if there's no captain,
there's no one to have the key.

799
01:16:53,337 --> 01:16:54,755
So the captain has the key?

800
01:16:57,131 --> 01:16:59,801
- Where is the key?
- Hidden.

801
01:17:00,260 --> 01:17:01,261
Where is the chest?

802
01:17:01,804 --> 01:17:03,639
Hidden.

803
01:17:06,182 --> 01:17:07,225
Captain Sparrow.

804
01:17:08,101 --> 01:17:09,936
Come to join me crew, lad?
Welcome aboard.

805
01:17:10,645 --> 01:17:12,105
I'm here to find the man I love.

806
01:17:14,358 --> 01:17:18,529
I'm deeply flattered, son,
but my first and only love is the sea.

807
01:17:19,988 --> 01:17:22,408
Meaning William Turner,
Captain Sparrow.

808
01:17:24,201 --> 01:17:25,577
Elizabeth.

809
01:17:25,743 --> 01:17:27,662
Hide the rum.

810
01:17:27,996 --> 01:17:31,341
You know, these clothes do not flatter you
at all. It should be a dress or nothing.

811
01:17:31,417 --> 01:17:34,168
- I happen to have no dress in my cabin.
- Jack.

812
01:17:36,505 --> 01:17:38,548
I know Will came to find you.
Where is he?

813
01:17:39,841 --> 01:17:42,261
Darling, I am truly unhappy
to have to tell you this,

814
01:17:42,427 --> 01:17:47,015
but through an unfortunate and entirely
unforeseeable series of circumstances

815
01:17:47,181 --> 01:17:50,060
that have nothing whatsoever
to do with me,

816
01:17:50,435 --> 01:17:55,064
poor Will has been press-ganged
into Davy Jones' crew.

817
01:17:56,149 --> 01:17:57,150
Davy Jones?

818
01:17:59,610 --> 01:18:01,697
Oh, please.

819
01:18:03,030 --> 01:18:05,324
<i>The captain of the Flying Dutchman?</i>

820
01:18:05,492 --> 01:18:07,578
You look bloody awful.
What are you doing here?

821
01:18:07,744 --> 01:18:11,247
You hired me.
I can't help it if your standards are lax.

822
01:18:11,414 --> 01:18:12,957
- You smell funny.
- Jack.

823
01:18:14,667 --> 01:18:16,336
All I want is to find Will.

824
01:18:20,798 --> 01:18:22,634
Are you certain?

825
01:18:22,801 --> 01:18:25,220
Is that what you really want most?

826
01:18:26,220 --> 01:18:27,346
Of course.

827
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:32,853
Because I would think, you'd want
to find a way to save Will the most.

828
01:18:33,604 --> 01:18:35,229
And you'd have a way of doing that?

829
01:18:36,023 --> 01:18:38,358
Well, there is a chest.

830
01:18:38,524 --> 01:18:40,569
Oh, dear.

831
01:18:40,819 --> 01:18:43,029
A chest of unknown size and origin.

832
01:18:43,197 --> 01:18:46,283
What contains the still-beating heart
of Davy Jones.

833
01:18:46,449 --> 01:18:48,118
Yeah.

834
01:18:49,536 --> 01:18:51,412
And whoever possesses that chest

835
01:18:51,579 --> 01:18:53,163
possesses the leverage
to command Jones

836
01:18:53,289 --> 01:18:55,501
to do whatever it is he or she wants,

837
01:18:55,667 --> 01:19:00,421
including saving brave William
from his grim fate.

838
01:19:00,588 --> 01:19:03,050
You don't actually believe him, do you?

839
01:19:08,846 --> 01:19:09,890
How do we find it?

840
01:19:13,393 --> 01:19:15,145
With this.

841
01:19:15,311 --> 01:19:18,189
My compass is unique.

842
01:19:18,815 --> 01:19:22,194
Unique here
having the meaning of broken.

843
01:19:23,028 --> 01:19:24,695
True enough.

844
01:19:24,863 --> 01:19:27,407
This compass does not point north.

845
01:19:29,701 --> 01:19:30,993
Where does it point?

846
01:19:32,578 --> 01:19:37,333
It points to the thing
you want most in this world.

847
01:19:40,002 --> 01:19:42,130
Oh, Jack.

848
01:19:44,006 --> 01:19:45,175
Are you telling the truth?

849
01:19:45,341 --> 01:19:47,469
Every word, love.

850
01:19:47,886 --> 01:19:50,264
And what you want most in this world

851
01:19:51,222 --> 01:19:55,935
is to find the chest of Davy Jones,
is it not?

852
01:19:56,103 --> 01:19:57,104
To save Will?

853
01:19:58,020 --> 01:20:01,649
By finding the chest of Davy Jones.

854
01:20:16,789 --> 01:20:19,083
- Mr. Gibbs!
- Captain.

855
01:20:19,251 --> 01:20:21,295
- We have our heading.
- Finally.

856
01:20:21,461 --> 01:20:24,881
Cast off those lines, weigh anchor
and crowd that canvas!

857
01:20:26,216 --> 01:20:27,301
Miss Swann.

858
01:20:27,466 --> 01:20:30,304
- Come on, lads! Make on deck, will you?
- Time to go now, eh.

859
01:20:30,470 --> 01:20:33,390
Welcome to the crew,
former commodore.

860
01:20:33,556 --> 01:20:36,225
Right. I remember that.

861
01:20:40,439 --> 01:20:42,899
There's something to knowing
the exact shape of the world

862
01:20:43,065 --> 01:20:44,943
and one's place in it, don't you agree?

863
01:20:45,402 --> 01:20:48,029
I assure you these are not necessary.

864
01:20:48,195 --> 01:20:50,623
I had you brought here
because I thought you'd be interested

865
01:20:50,698 --> 01:20:52,533
in the whereabouts of your daughter.

866
01:20:52,701 --> 01:20:54,953
- You have news of her?
- Most recently seen

867
01:20:55,119 --> 01:20:56,246
on the island of Tortuga

868
01:20:56,412 --> 01:21:00,292
then left in the company of a known pirate,
Jack Sparrow,

869
01:21:00,458 --> 01:21:03,252
and other fugitives from justice.

870
01:21:03,420 --> 01:21:05,212
Justice. Hardly.

871
01:21:05,380 --> 01:21:11,052
Including the previous owner
of this sword, I believe.

872
01:21:11,636 --> 01:21:12,720
Our ships are in pursuit

873
01:21:13,180 --> 01:21:16,432
and justice will be dispensed
by cannonade and cutlass

874
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:20,186
and all manner
of remorseless pieces of metal.

875
01:21:20,561 --> 01:21:23,899
I personally find it distasteful
to even contemplate the horror

876
01:21:24,065 --> 01:21:26,652
facing all those on board.

877
01:21:29,820 --> 01:21:31,573
What do you want from me?

878
01:21:31,739 --> 01:21:34,826
Your authority as governor,
your influence in London,

879
01:21:34,993 --> 01:21:38,497
and your loyalty
to the East India Trading Company.

880
01:21:39,747 --> 01:21:41,082
To you, you mean.

881
01:21:45,837 --> 01:21:47,463
Shall I remove these shackles?

882
01:21:51,801 --> 01:21:53,720
Do what you can for my daughter.

883
01:22:01,395 --> 01:22:03,604
So you see, Mercer,
every man has a price

884
01:22:03,771 --> 01:22:06,065
he will willingly accept,

885
01:22:06,524 --> 01:22:09,569
even for what he hopes never to sell.

886
01:22:16,033 --> 01:22:19,787
I wager ten years.

887
01:22:19,997 --> 01:22:22,873
I'll match ten years.

888
01:22:23,332 --> 01:22:25,042
Agreed.

889
01:22:27,295 --> 01:22:30,215
- Four fours.
- Wondering how it's played?

890
01:22:30,923 --> 01:22:32,175
I understand.

891
01:22:32,341 --> 01:22:34,636
- Liar!
- It's a game of deception.

892
01:22:34,802 --> 01:22:38,390
But your bet includes all the dice
not just your own.

893
01:22:38,849 --> 01:22:41,810
- What are they wagering?
- Oh, the only thing we have.

894
01:22:41,976 --> 01:22:44,311
Years of service.

895
01:22:46,439 --> 01:22:50,652
- So any crewmember can be challenged?
- Aye, anyone.

896
01:22:53,529 --> 01:22:56,574
I challenge Davy Jones.

897
01:23:15,969 --> 01:23:18,305
I accept that.

898
01:23:30,484 --> 01:23:31,818
The stakes?

899
01:23:32,485 --> 01:23:34,237
My soul.

900
01:23:34,404 --> 01:23:35,988
An eternity of servitude.

901
01:23:36,155 --> 01:23:37,698
No.

902
01:23:40,493 --> 01:23:41,953
Against?

903
01:23:43,454 --> 01:23:45,539
I want this.

904
01:23:57,676 --> 01:23:59,637
How do you know of the key?

905
01:24:00,096 --> 01:24:02,599
That's not part of the game, is it?

906
01:24:05,769 --> 01:24:07,229
You can still walk away.

907
01:24:33,087 --> 01:24:36,091
- What's this?
- I'm in. Matching his wager.

908
01:24:36,257 --> 01:24:37,341
No!

909
01:24:37,842 --> 01:24:39,051
Don't do this.

910
01:24:41,054 --> 01:24:42,721
The die is cast.

911
01:24:43,890 --> 01:24:45,559
I bet three twos.

912
01:24:47,101 --> 01:24:49,229
It's your bid, captain.

913
01:24:55,609 --> 01:24:58,779
Four fours.

914
01:25:07,622 --> 01:25:08,664
Four fives

915
01:25:10,958 --> 01:25:12,543
Six threes.

916
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:26,015
Seven fives.

917
01:25:49,288 --> 01:25:50,582
Eight fives.

918
01:25:56,337 --> 01:26:00,466
Welcome to the crew, lad.

919
01:26:02,051 --> 01:26:03,511
Twelve fives.

920
01:26:05,262 --> 01:26:06,890
Twelve fives.

921
01:26:07,056 --> 01:26:09,768
Call me a liar or up the bid.

922
01:26:11,144 --> 01:26:14,939
And be called a liar myself
for my trouble?

923
01:26:18,150 --> 01:26:22,988
Bootstrap Bill, you're a liar
and you will spend an eternity on this ship!

924
01:26:24,990 --> 01:26:29,703
Master Turner, feel free to go ashore

925
01:26:30,537 --> 01:26:34,251
the very next time we make port.

926
01:26:41,216 --> 01:26:42,716
Fool.

927
01:26:42,884 --> 01:26:45,095
Why did you do that?

928
01:26:46,304 --> 01:26:48,055
I couldn't let you lose.

929
01:26:48,597 --> 01:26:51,309
It was never about winning or losing.

930
01:26:53,770 --> 01:26:55,145
The key.

931
01:26:56,939 --> 01:26:59,650
You just wanted to know where it was.

932
01:27:19,421 --> 01:27:22,131
Captain says I'm to relieve you.

933
01:27:26,011 --> 01:27:28,012
Captain's orders.

934
01:29:17,913 --> 01:29:20,457
Here. Take this too.

935
01:29:21,458 --> 01:29:24,421
Now, get yourself to land,
and stay there.

936
01:29:25,296 --> 01:29:28,382
It was always in my blood to die at sea.

937
01:29:28,632 --> 01:29:30,510
It was not a fate I ever wanted for you.

938
01:29:36,474 --> 01:29:39,435
It's not a fate you had to choose
for yourself, either.

939
01:29:40,185 --> 01:29:41,688
Aye.

940
01:29:41,854 --> 01:29:47,109
I could say I did what I had to,
when I left you to go pirating.

941
01:29:47,359 --> 01:29:50,320
But it would taste a lie
to say it wasn't what I wanted.

942
01:29:53,408 --> 01:29:55,827
You owe me nothing, Will.

943
01:29:56,202 --> 01:29:57,203
Now go.

944
01:29:59,456 --> 01:30:01,541
They'll know you helped me.

945
01:30:03,626 --> 01:30:05,502
What more can they do to me?

946
01:30:11,426 --> 01:30:13,595
I take this with a promise.

947
01:30:13,761 --> 01:30:16,055
I'll find a way
to sever Jones's hold on you,

948
01:30:16,221 --> 01:30:18,600
and not rest
until this blade pierces his heart.

949
01:30:21,644 --> 01:30:23,896
I will not abandon you.

950
01:30:26,565 --> 01:30:28,025
I promise.

951
01:30:43,332 --> 01:30:45,376
- Beckett?
- Yes, they're signed.

952
01:30:45,542 --> 01:30:48,046
Lord Cutler Beckett
of the East India Trading Company.

953
01:30:49,713 --> 01:30:53,301
Will was working for Beckett
and never said a word.

954
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:55,845
Beckett wants the compass.

955
01:30:56,011 --> 01:30:57,514
Only one reason for that.

956
01:30:57,680 --> 01:30:59,599
Of course.

957
01:31:00,265 --> 01:31:01,475
He wants the chest.

958
01:31:01,935 --> 01:31:03,936
Yes, he did say something
about a chest.

959
01:31:04,103 --> 01:31:07,273
If the company controls the chest,
they controls the sea.

960
01:31:07,439 --> 01:31:11,485
- A truly discomfiting notion, love.
- And bad.

961
01:31:11,653 --> 01:31:14,363
Bad for every mother's son
what calls himself a pirate.

962
01:31:15,405 --> 01:31:18,534
I think there's a bit more speed
to be coaxed from these sails.

963
01:31:18,701 --> 01:31:20,787
Brace the foreyard!

964
01:31:20,953 --> 01:31:23,664
Might I enquire
as to how you came by these?

965
01:31:24,248 --> 01:31:25,332
Persuasion.

966
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:27,877
- Friendly?
- Decidedly not.

967
01:31:28,043 --> 01:31:30,505
Will strikes a deal for these
and upholds it with honour,

968
01:31:30,671 --> 01:31:32,671
yet you are the one standing here
with the prize.

969
01:31:32,756 --> 01:31:34,551
"Full pardon.
Commission as a privateer

970
01:31:34,716 --> 01:31:38,720
on behalf of England
and the East India Trading Company."

971
01:31:38,887 --> 01:31:41,265
As if I could be bought
for such a low price.

972
01:31:41,431 --> 01:31:44,519
- Jack, the letters, give them back.
- No. Persuade me.

973
01:31:46,270 --> 01:31:49,690
You do know Will taught me
how to handle a sword?

974
01:31:52,443 --> 01:31:56,029
As I said, persuade me.

975
01:32:10,420 --> 01:32:12,796
It's a curious thing.

976
01:32:13,797 --> 01:32:15,797
There was a time
when I would have given anything

977
01:32:15,882 --> 01:32:19,136
for you to look like that
while thinking about me.

978
01:32:19,679 --> 01:32:21,847
- I don't know what you mean.
- Oh, I think you do.

979
01:32:22,015 --> 01:32:24,891
Oh, don't be absurd.
I trust him, that's all.

980
01:32:29,689 --> 01:32:31,733
So you never wondered
how your latest fiancÃ©

981
01:32:31,899 --> 01:32:35,194
<i>ended up on the Flying Dutchman
in the first place?</i>

982
01:33:00,595 --> 01:33:03,847
Strange thing to come upon a longboat
so far out in open waters.

983
01:33:04,015 --> 01:33:07,268
Just put as many leagues behind us
as you can. As fast as you can.

984
01:33:07,435 --> 01:33:08,685
And what are we running from'?

985
01:33:15,400 --> 01:33:18,070
That dress. Where did you get it?

986
01:33:18,237 --> 01:33:19,863
It was found aboard the ship.

987
01:33:20,030 --> 01:33:24,202
The crew thought it was a spirit
bringing some omen of ill-fate.

988
01:33:24,618 --> 01:33:28,206
- That's foolish.
- Oh, yes. Exceedingly foolish.

989
01:33:28,372 --> 01:33:30,082
It brought good fortune.

990
01:33:30,248 --> 01:33:36,381
The spirit told us, "Pull in at Tortuga",
and we made a nice bit of profit there.

991
01:33:36,546 --> 01:33:38,675
Off the books, of course.

992
01:33:39,550 --> 01:33:43,179
I imagine some of your crew
may have jumped ship there.

993
01:33:43,345 --> 01:33:44,346
Why do you ask?

994
01:33:44,514 --> 01:33:46,224
Captain, a ship's been spotted.

995
01:33:46,390 --> 01:33:48,141
- Colours?
- She isn't flying any.

996
01:33:49,268 --> 01:33:51,186
- Pirates.
- Or worse.

997
01:34:02,739 --> 01:34:05,909
You will watch this.

998
01:34:13,501 --> 01:34:16,421
Let no joyful voice be heard.

999
01:34:18,547 --> 01:34:21,759
Let no man look up at the sky
with hope.

1000
01:34:24,052 --> 01:34:29,725
And let this day be cursed
by we who ready to wake...

1001
01:34:31,310 --> 01:34:33,354
the Kraken.

1002
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:35,439
No!

1003
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:40,610
What kind of ship?

1004
01:34:41,529 --> 01:34:43,029
What is it?

1005
01:34:46,283 --> 01:34:48,202
Starboard.

1006
01:34:52,414 --> 01:34:54,458
I've doomed us all.

1007
01:34:55,417 --> 01:34:58,378
It's the Flying Dutchman!

1008
01:35:03,216 --> 01:35:05,552
Oh, Mother Carey's chickens!
What happened?

1009
01:35:05,720 --> 01:35:07,012
Must have hit a reef.

1010
01:35:16,229 --> 01:35:18,983
Free the rudder!
Hard to port then harder starboard!

1011
01:35:19,149 --> 01:35:22,403
- Free the rudder!
- Hard to port!

1012
01:35:29,743 --> 01:35:31,119
Kraken!

1013
01:35:31,287 --> 01:35:33,163
- Kraken!
- To arms!

1014
01:35:33,872 --> 01:35:35,832
To arms!

1015
01:35:43,173 --> 01:35:45,967
- Now!
- Take up the axe!

1016
01:35:46,761 --> 01:35:49,639
Here it is! Take it!

1017
01:35:49,805 --> 01:35:51,515
Take it!

1018
01:36:05,279 --> 01:36:06,738
Kraken!

1019
01:36:32,890 --> 01:36:34,809
Go!

1020
01:38:03,773 --> 01:38:05,024
The boy's not here.

1021
01:38:05,190 --> 01:38:07,902
He must have been claimed by the sea.

1022
01:38:08,360 --> 01:38:11,322
I am the sea.

1023
01:38:14,533 --> 01:38:18,662
You need time alone
with your thoughts. Brig!

1024
01:38:18,828 --> 01:38:20,288
What of the survivors?

1025
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:28,797
There are no survivors.

1026
01:38:49,443 --> 01:38:51,278
The chest is no longer safe.

1027
01:38:51,444 --> 01:38:53,698
Chart a course to Isla Cruces.

1028
01:38:53,863 --> 01:38:56,074
Get me there first
or there'll be the devil to pay.

1029
01:38:56,242 --> 01:38:57,993
First?

1030
01:38:58,159 --> 01:39:01,247
Who sent that thieving charlatan
onto my ship?

1031
01:39:01,413 --> 01:39:03,332
Who told them of the key?

1032
01:39:06,502 --> 01:39:08,587
Jack Sparrow.

1033
01:39:27,064 --> 01:39:29,158
My tremendous intuitive sense
of the female creature

1034
01:39:29,233 --> 01:39:31,944
informs me that you are troubled.

1035
01:39:33,988 --> 01:39:35,573
I just thought I'd be married by now.

1036
01:39:37,408 --> 01:39:39,618
I'm so ready to be married.

1037
01:39:47,376 --> 01:39:49,086
You know,

1038
01:39:51,046 --> 01:39:52,672
Lizzie,

1039
01:39:52,881 --> 01:39:56,385
I am captain of a ship.

1040
01:39:56,551 --> 01:40:02,975
And being captain of a ship, I could,
in fact, perform a marriage,

1041
01:40:03,141 --> 01:40:04,894
right here,

1042
01:40:05,060 --> 01:40:07,188
right on this deck,

1043
01:40:07,479 --> 01:40:09,398
right now.

1044
01:40:13,194 --> 01:40:15,362
No, thank you.

1045
01:40:15,529 --> 01:40:16,988
Why not?

1046
01:40:17,155 --> 01:40:20,242
We are very much alike, you and I.
I and you. Us.

1047
01:40:20,408 --> 01:40:25,247
Oh, except for a sense of honour
and a decency and a moral centre.

1048
01:40:25,914 --> 01:40:26,998
And personal hygiene.

1049
01:40:29,667 --> 01:40:31,462
Trifles

1050
01:40:32,128 --> 01:40:34,590
You will come over to my side,
I know it.

1051
01:40:35,006 --> 01:40:36,591
You seem very certain.

1052
01:40:36,759 --> 01:40:39,929
One word, love: curiosity.

1053
01:40:40,095 --> 01:40:41,639
You long for freedom.

1054
01:40:41,805 --> 01:40:44,809
You long to do what you want to do
because you want it.

1055
01:40:44,975 --> 01:40:47,895
To act on selfish impulse.

1056
01:40:48,061 --> 01:40:50,523
You want to see what it's like.

1057
01:40:50,980 --> 01:40:52,483
One day,

1058
01:40:52,649 --> 01:40:55,319
you won't be able to resist.

1059
01:40:55,903 --> 01:40:57,445
Why doesn't your compass work?

1060
01:41:00,198 --> 01:41:02,701
My compass works fine.

1061
01:41:03,661 --> 01:41:05,328
Because you and I are alike.

1062
01:41:05,496 --> 01:41:08,289
And there will come a moment
when you have the chance to show it.

1063
01:41:08,748 --> 01:41:10,458
To do the right thing.

1064
01:41:10,626 --> 01:41:12,127
I love those moments.

1065
01:41:12,711 --> 01:41:14,921
I like to wave at them as they pass by.

1066
01:41:15,088 --> 01:41:20,094
You'll have the chance
to do something-- Something courageous.

1067
01:41:20,719 --> 01:41:22,469
And when you do,
you'll discover something.

1068
01:41:24,055 --> 01:41:26,391
That you're a good man.

1069
01:41:26,684 --> 01:41:29,060
All evidence to the contrary.

1070
01:41:29,228 --> 01:41:30,938
Oh, I have faith in you.

1071
01:41:32,398 --> 01:41:35,775
- Want to know why?
- Do tell, dearie.

1072
01:41:37,110 --> 01:41:39,113
Curiosity.

1073
01:41:40,029 --> 01:41:41,364
You're going to want it.

1074
01:41:43,158 --> 01:41:46,953
A chance to be admired
and gain the rewards that follow.

1075
01:41:48,372 --> 01:41:50,791
You won't be able to resist.

1076
01:41:52,001 --> 01:41:54,670
You're going to want to know

1077
01:41:55,171 --> 01:41:57,088
what it tastes like.

1078
01:41:59,757 --> 01:42:02,636
I do want to know what it tastes like.

1079
01:42:02,802 --> 01:42:04,555
But seeing as you're a good man,

1080
01:42:04,721 --> 01:42:06,931
I know that you'd never put me
in a position

1081
01:42:07,099 --> 01:42:09,018
that would compromise my honour.

1082
01:42:17,359 --> 01:42:18,944
I'm proud of you, Jack.

1083
01:42:19,569 --> 01:42:23,157
Land, ho!

1084
01:42:27,578 --> 01:42:29,329
I want my jar of dirt.

1085
01:42:30,872 --> 01:42:32,373
You're pulling too fast.

1086
01:42:32,541 --> 01:42:35,836
You're pulling too slow.
We don't want the Kraken to catch us.

1087
01:42:36,002 --> 01:42:39,006
I'm saving me strength
for when it comes.

1088
01:42:39,172 --> 01:42:41,341
And I don't think it's Kraken, anyways.

1089
01:42:41,507 --> 01:42:43,469
I always heard it said Krayken.

1090
01:42:43,636 --> 01:42:45,220
What, with a long A?

1091
01:42:45,386 --> 01:42:49,182
No, no, no. Krahken's how it's pronounced
in the original Scandinavian

1092
01:42:49,350 --> 01:42:50,516
and Kraken's closer to that.

1093
01:42:50,643 --> 01:42:54,145
Well, we ain't original Scandinavians,
are we?

1094
01:42:54,313 --> 01:42:56,021
- Krayken.
- It's a mythological creature,

1095
01:42:56,148 --> 01:42:57,315
I can calls it what I wants.

1096
01:43:01,237 --> 01:43:05,658
Guard the boat, mind the tide.
Don't touch my dirt.

1097
01:43:41,652 --> 01:43:42,653
This doesn't work.

1098
01:43:43,112 --> 01:43:45,530
And it certainly doesn't show you
what you want most.

1099
01:43:51,203 --> 01:43:52,871
Yes, it does.

1100
01:43:53,037 --> 01:43:55,039
You're sitting on it.

1101
01:43:55,373 --> 01:43:57,042
- Beg pardon?
- Move.

1102
01:44:04,882 --> 01:44:07,427
- "Guard the boat. Mind the tide."
- I could join the circus.

1103
01:44:07,594 --> 01:44:09,262
"Don't mind if I shine your shoes, sir."

1104
01:44:13,766 --> 01:44:15,560
They're here.

1105
01:44:15,853 --> 01:44:18,354
And I cannot step foot on land again
for near of a decade.

1106
01:44:18,521 --> 01:44:20,064
You'll trust us to act in your stead?

1107
01:44:20,649 --> 01:44:23,902
I'll trust you to know what awaits you
should you fail!

1108
01:44:25,570 --> 01:44:26,904
Down, then!

1109
01:44:27,072 --> 01:44:28,614
- Down!
- Down!

1110
01:44:28,782 --> 01:44:30,951
Down!

1111
01:45:38,310 --> 01:45:39,310
It's real.

1112
01:45:41,313 --> 01:45:43,314
You actually were telling the truth.

1113
01:45:43,481 --> 01:45:46,234
I do that quite a lot.
Yet people are always surprised.

1114
01:45:47,110 --> 01:45:48,112
With good reason.

1115
01:45:50,072 --> 01:45:51,657
Will.

1116
01:45:52,698 --> 01:45:56,453
You're all right. Thank God.
I came to find you.

1117
01:46:02,542 --> 01:46:03,836
How did you get here?

1118
01:46:04,711 --> 01:46:06,462
Sea turtles, mate,

1119
01:46:06,630 --> 01:46:08,590
a pair of them strapped to my feet.

1120
01:46:08,756 --> 01:46:09,882
Not so easy, is it?

1121
01:46:10,716 --> 01:46:13,302
- But I do owe you thanks, Jack.
- You do?

1122
01:46:13,470 --> 01:46:17,515
After you tricked me onto that ship
to square your debt with Jones...

1123
01:46:17,975 --> 01:46:19,643
- What?
- What?

1124
01:46:20,310 --> 01:46:22,895
...I was reunited with my father.

1125
01:46:23,063 --> 01:46:25,690
Oh, well, you're welcome, then.

1126
01:46:26,274 --> 01:46:29,987
Everything you said to me,
every word was a lie!

1127
01:46:30,154 --> 01:46:33,239
Pretty much. Time and tide, love.

1128
01:46:35,658 --> 01:46:37,411
What are you doing?

1129
01:46:37,578 --> 01:46:38,828
I'm gonna kill Jones.

1130
01:46:40,913 --> 01:46:42,332
Can't let you do that, William.

1131
01:46:43,332 --> 01:46:44,626
Because if Jones is dead,

1132
01:46:45,461 --> 01:46:47,796
who's to call his terrible beastie
off the hunt, eh?

1133
01:46:55,429 --> 01:46:58,681
Now, if you please.

1134
01:46:59,390 --> 01:47:00,475
The key.

1135
01:47:04,229 --> 01:47:06,689
I keep the promises I make, Jack.

1136
01:47:06,856 --> 01:47:10,277
I intend to free my father.
I hope you're here to see it.

1137
01:47:10,444 --> 01:47:12,570
I can't let you do that either.

1138
01:47:12,738 --> 01:47:13,947
So sorry.

1139
01:47:14,113 --> 01:47:16,617
I knew you'd warm up to me eventually.

1140
01:47:18,452 --> 01:47:21,162
Lord Beckett desires the contents
of that chest.

1141
01:47:22,622 --> 01:47:25,667
I deliver it, I get my life back.

1142
01:47:27,252 --> 01:47:28,753
The dark side of ambition.

1143
01:47:29,212 --> 01:47:32,632
Oh, I prefer to see it
as the promise of redemption.

1144
01:47:37,054 --> 01:47:38,471
Stop it!

1145
01:47:42,643 --> 01:47:44,310
Be careful!

1146
01:47:45,186 --> 01:47:46,646
Will!

1147
01:47:47,689 --> 01:47:50,650
- Guard the chest.
- No!

1148
01:47:50,817 --> 01:47:53,194
This is barbaric!

1149
01:47:53,362 --> 01:47:55,780
This is no way for grown men to settle--

1150
01:47:55,948 --> 01:47:57,032
Oh, fine!

1151
01:47:57,658 --> 01:48:01,411
Let's just pull out our swords
and start banging away at each other!

1152
01:48:01,578 --> 01:48:03,079
That will solve everything!

1153
01:48:03,247 --> 01:48:09,711
I've had it! I've had it with wobbly-legged,
rum-soaked pirates!

1154
01:48:11,880 --> 01:48:13,548
And how'd this go all screwy?

1155
01:48:13,715 --> 01:48:14,841
- Enough!
- Well,

1156
01:48:15,007 --> 01:48:16,926
each wants the chest for hisself,
don%he?

1157
01:48:17,094 --> 01:48:20,180
Mr. Norrington, I think,
he's trying regain a bit of honour.

1158
01:48:20,346 --> 01:48:22,765
Old Jack's looking to trade it,
save his own skin.

1159
01:48:22,932 --> 01:48:25,726
And Turner there,
I figure he's trying to settle

1160
01:48:25,894 --> 01:48:30,606
some unresolved business 'twixt him
and his twice-cursed pirate father.

1161
01:48:30,940 --> 01:48:32,734
- Sad.
- This is madness!

1162
01:48:32,900 --> 01:48:35,444
That chest must be worth more
than a shiny penny.

1163
01:48:35,612 --> 01:48:38,657
Oh, terrible temptation.

1164
01:48:38,823 --> 01:48:44,829
If we was any kind of decent,
we'd remove temptation from their path.

1165
01:48:50,543 --> 01:48:52,421
Enough!

1166
01:48:57,091 --> 01:48:59,636
Oh, the heat!

1167
01:49:20,157 --> 01:49:21,158
Bugger

1168
01:49:34,630 --> 01:49:36,965
By your leave, Mr. Turner.

1169
01:50:23,970 --> 01:50:25,471
By your leave, Mr. Norrington.

1170
01:51:19,109 --> 01:51:21,987
Do excuse me while I kill the man
who ruined my life.

1171
01:51:22,154 --> 01:51:23,154
Be my guest.

1172
01:51:23,320 --> 01:51:26,158
Let us examine that claim for a moment,
former commodore, shall we?

1173
01:51:26,699 --> 01:51:29,286
Who was it, that at the very moment

1174
01:51:29,453 --> 01:51:32,079
you had a notorious pirate
safely behind bars,

1175
01:51:32,247 --> 01:51:35,167
saw fit to free said pirate

1176
01:51:35,332 --> 01:51:38,962
and take your dearly beloved
all to hisself, eh?

1177
01:51:40,212 --> 01:51:42,631
So who's fault is it really

1178
01:51:42,798 --> 01:51:47,095
that you've ended up a rum-pot deck hand
what takes orders from pirates?

1179
01:51:47,261 --> 01:51:49,055
Enough!

1180
01:51:51,600 --> 01:51:55,270
Unfortunately, Mr. Turner, he's right!

1181
01:51:57,229 --> 01:51:59,149
Still rooting for you, mate.

1182
01:52:57,457 --> 01:53:00,126
- We got it. We got it.
- We got it.

1183
01:53:14,515 --> 01:53:16,184
Hello, poppet.

1184
01:53:44,503 --> 01:53:46,297
Come on, run!

1185
01:54:29,215 --> 01:54:31,134
- Sword!
- Sword! Sword!

1186
01:54:34,054 --> 01:54:35,639
Sword!

1187
01:55:17,346 --> 01:55:19,890
Follow my voice. Follow my voice.

1188
01:55:20,057 --> 01:55:24,395
To the left. No, turn around.
Go to the right. Go--

1189
01:55:24,561 --> 01:55:27,106
No, that's a tree.

1190
01:55:27,273 --> 01:55:28,608
Oh, shut it.

1191
01:55:50,421 --> 01:55:51,715
- It's over there.
- Jack!

1192
01:55:55,635 --> 01:55:57,636
- You have it.
- Yeah.

1193
01:56:18,240 --> 01:56:19,868
Jar of dirt.

1194
01:57:20,345 --> 01:57:21,512
Right.

1195
01:57:46,871 --> 01:57:49,414
- We'll hang on to that.
- Come on.

1196
01:57:55,880 --> 01:57:57,798
We've got it.

1197
01:58:00,301 --> 01:58:01,845
All right.

1198
01:58:07,850 --> 01:58:09,101
Come along, Turner!

1199
01:58:26,911 --> 01:58:29,997
Leave him alone! Unless you plan
on using him to hit something with.

1200
01:58:31,707 --> 01:58:35,211
- We're not getting out of this.
- Not with the chest. Into the boat.

1201
01:58:36,880 --> 01:58:38,840
- You're mad.
- Don't wait for me.

1202
01:58:45,889 --> 01:58:49,600
- I say we respect his final wish.
- Aye!

1203
01:58:59,027 --> 01:59:01,487
Your bravery is wasted.

1204
01:59:02,947 --> 01:59:08,036
I shall pry the chest away
from your cold, dead hands.

1205
01:59:11,247 --> 01:59:12,916
Here you go.

1206
01:59:24,761 --> 01:59:26,429
Pirates.

1207
01:59:34,479 --> 01:59:35,939
Hey!

1208
01:59:44,572 --> 01:59:45,697
What happened to the chest?

1209
01:59:46,073 --> 01:59:47,992
Norrington took it to draw them off.

1210
01:59:48,451 --> 01:59:49,661
You're pulling too hard!

1211
01:59:49,827 --> 01:59:51,662
You ain't pulling hard enough!

1212
01:59:52,121 --> 01:59:54,832
- Where's the commodore?
- Fell behind.

1213
01:59:55,332 --> 01:59:57,417
My prayers be with him.

1214
01:59:57,585 --> 01:59:58,962
Best not wallow in our grief.

1215
01:59:59,628 --> 02:00:05,176
The bright side is you're back
and made it off free and clear.

1216
02:00:19,940 --> 02:00:22,150
Lord on high, deliver us.

1217
02:00:25,529 --> 02:00:27,198
I'll handle this, mate.

1218
02:00:30,118 --> 02:00:31,159
Fish face.

1219
02:00:32,744 --> 02:00:35,206
Lose something? Hey, scungilli.

1220
02:00:40,545 --> 02:00:42,171
Got it.

1221
02:00:43,756 --> 02:00:46,717
Come to negotiate, eh,
have you, you slimy git?

1222
02:00:46,884 --> 02:00:48,302
Look what I got.

1223
02:00:48,469 --> 02:00:51,514
<i>I got a jar of dirt
I got a jar of dirt</i>

1224
02:00:51,680 --> 02:00:53,432
<i>And guess what's inside it</i>

1225
02:00:54,475 --> 02:00:55,851
Enough.

1226
02:01:04,068 --> 02:01:05,194
Hard to starboard.

1227
02:01:05,360 --> 02:01:08,238
- Hard to starboard!
- Brace up the foreyard!

1228
02:01:13,077 --> 02:01:15,121
Hard to starboard!

1229
02:01:15,287 --> 02:01:18,832
Send his beloved <i>Pearl</i>
back to the depths.

1230
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:20,126
Fire!

1231
02:01:32,305 --> 02:01:36,059
She's on us! She's on us!

1232
02:01:37,726 --> 02:01:41,730
- Let them taste the triple guns.
- Aye, captain.

1233
02:02:07,715 --> 02:02:09,132
Make fast!

1234
02:02:10,426 --> 02:02:12,970
Go on, me darling.
Show us what you've got.

1235
02:02:13,136 --> 02:02:16,306
Come on, girl!

1236
02:02:21,938 --> 02:02:24,106
- She's falling behind.
- Aye, we've got her.

1237
02:02:24,273 --> 02:02:25,274
We're the faster?

1238
02:02:25,440 --> 02:02:28,286
Against the wind the Dutchman beats us,
that's how she takes her prey.

1239
02:02:28,360 --> 02:02:31,572
- But with the wind...
- We rob her advantage.

1240
02:02:34,658 --> 02:02:36,118
They're out of range!

1241
02:02:36,284 --> 02:02:40,832
Break off pursuit, run out light
and douse canvas.

1242
02:02:40,997 --> 02:02:42,917
We giving up, sir?

1243
02:02:53,469 --> 02:02:55,680
They're giving up!

1244
02:03:01,810 --> 02:03:03,813
My father is on that ship.

1245
02:03:03,979 --> 02:03:06,573
If we can outrun her, we can take her.
We should turn and fight.

1246
02:03:06,649 --> 02:03:09,193
Why fight when you can negotiate?

1247
02:03:09,359 --> 02:03:13,488
All one needs is the proper leverage.

1248
02:03:23,623 --> 02:03:26,877
Where is it?
Where is the thump-thump?

1249
02:03:27,837 --> 02:03:29,005
We must have hit the reef!

1250
02:03:32,925 --> 02:03:35,386
No. It's not a reef!

1251
02:03:35,886 --> 02:03:37,012
Get away from the rail!

1252
02:03:37,180 --> 02:03:38,764
- What is it?
- The Kraken.

1253
02:03:40,140 --> 02:03:42,643
- To arms!
- All guns, defend the masts!

1254
02:03:42,810 --> 02:03:44,770
It'll attack the starboard.
I've seen it before!

1255
02:03:45,229 --> 02:03:47,148
Run out the cannons
and hold for my signal.

1256
02:03:53,112 --> 02:03:55,155
Come on! Come on!

1257
02:04:20,805 --> 02:04:23,184
Easy, boys!

1258
02:04:26,604 --> 02:04:27,604
Will?

1259
02:04:28,230 --> 02:04:30,315
Steady. Steady.

1260
02:04:32,359 --> 02:04:35,695
- Will?
- Hold. Hold.

1261
02:04:35,863 --> 02:04:38,823
I think we've held fire long enough.

1262
02:04:39,617 --> 02:04:42,411
- Will?
- Fire!

1263
02:04:46,582 --> 02:04:47,832
No!

1264
02:05:02,597 --> 02:05:04,641
It'll be back.
We have to get off the ship.

1265
02:05:04,809 --> 02:05:06,060
There's no boats.

1266
02:05:14,402 --> 02:05:18,863
Pull the grates. Get all the gunpowder
onto the net in the cargo hold!

1267
02:05:21,242 --> 02:05:22,659
Whatever you do, don't miss.

1268
02:05:23,159 --> 02:05:25,121
As soon as you're clear.

1269
02:05:39,926 --> 02:05:42,220
We are short stocked on gunpowder.

1270
02:05:42,387 --> 02:05:44,556
Six barrel.

1271
02:05:45,056 --> 02:05:46,809
Hurry UP!

1272
02:05:47,225 --> 02:05:49,020
There's only half a dozen
kegs of powder.

1273
02:05:49,185 --> 02:05:50,770
Then load the rum.

1274
02:05:59,738 --> 02:06:02,490
Aye, the rum too!

1275
02:06:30,728 --> 02:06:32,520
Step to.

1276
02:06:36,399 --> 02:06:38,694
Oh, you coward.

1277
02:06:43,698 --> 02:06:44,742
Not good.

1278
02:06:53,833 --> 02:06:56,420
- Haul away!
- Heave!

1279
02:06:56,587 --> 02:06:58,713
Heave like you're being paid for it!

1280
02:06:58,881 --> 02:07:00,882
Put your backs into it!

1281
02:07:01,050 --> 02:07:04,261
- Pull it away!
- Come on, you can do it!

1282
02:07:44,051 --> 02:07:46,261
I got you! I got you!

1283
02:07:46,429 --> 02:07:48,305
- Don't let me go!
- I won't let you go!

1284
02:07:48,805 --> 02:07:49,931
Shoot me!

1285
02:07:55,354 --> 02:07:58,274
- Here!
- Here! Come on!

1286
02:08:15,248 --> 02:08:17,292
Here! Come on!

1287
02:08:18,002 --> 02:08:20,587
Come and get me. I'm over here!

1288
02:08:20,755 --> 02:08:21,756
Come on!

1289
02:08:47,614 --> 02:08:49,283
Shoot!

1290
02:08:49,449 --> 02:08:50,868
Elizabeth, shoot!

1291
02:10:18,329 --> 02:10:20,164
Did We kill it?

1292
02:10:20,332 --> 02:10:23,793
No. We just made it angry.

1293
02:10:24,211 --> 02:10:27,088
We're not out of this yet.
Captain, orders!

1294
02:10:29,216 --> 02:10:32,176
Abandon ship. Into the longboat.

1295
02:10:34,179 --> 02:10:35,680
Jack.

1296
02:10:35,847 --> 02:10:37,807
<i>The Pearl.</i>

1297
02:10:38,225 --> 02:10:39,894
She's only a ship, mate.

1298
02:10:40,728 --> 02:10:42,354
He's right. We have to head for land.

1299
02:10:43,354 --> 02:10:46,317
- It's a lot of open water.
- It's a lot of water.

1300
02:10:46,483 --> 02:10:48,068
We have to try.

1301
02:10:48,985 --> 02:10:51,070
We can get away
as it takes down the Pearl.

1302
02:10:53,073 --> 02:10:54,783
Abandon ship.

1303
02:10:54,949 --> 02:10:57,869
Abandon ship or abandon hope.

1304
02:11:14,094 --> 02:11:15,970
Thank you, Jack.

1305
02:11:18,431 --> 02:11:19,891
We're not free yet, love.

1306
02:11:21,185 --> 02:11:23,145
You came back.

1307
02:11:25,980 --> 02:11:28,567
I always knew you were a good man.

1308
02:11:41,663 --> 02:11:44,416
Prepare to cast off.
There's no time to lose.

1309
02:11:44,582 --> 02:11:46,877
Come on, Will. Step to!

1310
02:12:06,063 --> 02:12:08,439
It's after you, not the ship.

1311
02:12:08,606 --> 02:12:10,400
It's not us.

1312
02:12:11,609 --> 02:12:14,195
This is the only way, don't you see?

1313
02:12:17,699 --> 02:12:19,702
I'm not sorry.

1314
02:12:25,457 --> 02:12:27,292
Pirate.

1315
02:12:46,811 --> 02:12:48,479
Where's Jack?

1316
02:12:51,899 --> 02:12:54,653
He elected to stay behind
to give us a chance.

1317
02:13:05,247 --> 02:13:06,789
Go!

1318
02:13:20,595 --> 02:13:22,139
Bugger, bugger, bugger!

1319
02:13:51,542 --> 02:13:52,586
Come on.

1320
02:13:57,841 --> 02:13:59,551
Just got it. Come on.

1321
02:14:29,789 --> 02:14:31,125
Not so bad.

1322
02:14:43,554 --> 02:14:45,264
Hello, beastie.

1323
02:15:34,188 --> 02:15:38,317
Jack Sparrow, our debt is settled.

1324
02:15:39,568 --> 02:15:41,862
The captain goes down with the ship.

1325
02:15:42,029 --> 02:15:45,908
Turns out not even Jack Sparrow
can best the devil.

1326
02:15:51,454 --> 02:15:52,497
Open the chest.

1327
02:15:55,125 --> 02:15:57,586
Open the chest. I need to see it!

1328
02:16:13,018 --> 02:16:20,024
Damn you, Jack Sparrow!

1329
02:16:25,029 --> 02:16:27,698
The last of our ships is returned.

1330
02:16:27,865 --> 02:16:30,953
- Is there any news on the chest?
- None.

1331
02:16:31,118 --> 02:16:35,748
But one of the ships
did pick up a man adrift at sea.

1332
02:16:36,083 --> 02:16:38,042
He had these.

1333
02:16:45,299 --> 02:16:48,762
I took the liberty of filling in my name.

1334
02:16:55,935 --> 02:16:59,439
If you intend to claim these,
then you must have something to trade.

1335
02:17:00,065 --> 02:17:02,109
Do you have the compass?

1336
02:17:02,775 --> 02:17:04,278
Better.

1337
02:17:11,826 --> 02:17:14,288
The heart of Davy Jones.

1338
02:18:09,800 --> 02:18:14,513
Against the cold and the sorrow.

1339
02:18:24,941 --> 02:18:27,110
It's a shame.

1340
02:18:27,568 --> 02:18:29,987
I know you're thinking
that with the <i>Pearl</i>

1341
02:18:30,155 --> 02:18:34,575
you could have captured the devil
and set free your father's soul.

1342
02:18:35,619 --> 02:18:37,620
Doesn't matter now.

1343
02:18:38,413 --> 02:18:43,042
The <i>Pearl</i> is gone,
along with its captain.

1344
02:18:43,209 --> 02:18:44,795
Aye.

1345
02:18:45,504 --> 02:18:49,382
And already the world
seems a bit less bright.

1346
02:18:49,549 --> 02:18:52,468
He fooled us all right till the end,

1347
02:18:52,718 --> 02:18:56,597
but I guess that honest streak
finally won out.

1348
02:18:59,308 --> 02:19:01,019
To Jack Sparrow.

1349
02:19:01,185 --> 02:19:03,772
Never another like Captain Jack.

1350
02:19:03,939 --> 02:19:06,066
He was a gentleman of fortune, he was.

1351
02:19:06,774 --> 02:19:08,735
He was a good man.

1352
02:19:29,548 --> 02:19:32,968
If there was anything could be done
to bring him back...

1353
02:19:34,927 --> 02:19:37,638
- Elizabeth.
- Would you do it?

1354
02:19:39,933 --> 02:19:42,184
What would you?

1355
02:19:45,729 --> 02:19:48,859
What would any of you be willing to do?

1356
02:19:50,818 --> 02:19:54,656
Would you sail to the ends of the Earth
and beyond

1357
02:19:54,823 --> 02:19:59,827
to fetch back witty Jack
and him precious <i>Pearl?</i>

1358
02:20:06,126 --> 02:20:07,209
Aye.

1359
02:20:08,378 --> 02:20:09,629
Aye.

1360
02:20:10,337 --> 02:20:11,465
Aye.

1361
02:20:12,841 --> 02:20:13,842
Aye.

1362
02:20:16,844 --> 02:20:18,388
Yes.

1363
02:20:21,224 --> 02:20:22,601
Aye.

1364
02:20:22,766 --> 02:20:24,852
All right.

1365
02:20:25,686 --> 02:20:32,611
But if you go and brave the weird
and haunted shores at world's end

1366
02:20:33,778 --> 02:20:40,534
then you will need a captain
who knows those waters.

1367
02:20:54,966 --> 02:20:59,554
So tell me, what's become of my ship?
