1
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:15,597
In other news tonight,
a constitutional amendment

2
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:18,767
which would allow 18-year-olds
to vote in all elections

3
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:22,438
cleared the Congress and headed
for the White House this afternoon.

4
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:26,900
President Nixon gave every indication
he will sign the amendment into law.

5
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:29,945
This is not an invasion of Cambodia.

6
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:47,588
As the Soviet military displayed its
arsenal at this year's May Day parade,

7
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:51,884
the State Department reaffirmed
that the Cold War is as cold as ever.

8
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:55,345
The Soviets take the ball in. It's a
cross-court pass to Belov. He's got it!

9
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:59,725
He's up! He scores! The Soviets
take the gold over the United States!

10
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:03,437
People have got to know whether
or not their president's a crook.

11
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,480
I'm not a crook.

12
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:07,733
I shall resign the presidency,
effective at noon tomorrow.

13
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:10,944
The secret behind today's
modern computer is the silicon chip.

14
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:15,115
Some experts predict this modern marvel
might one day impact our daily lives.

15
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:18,118
This is homecoming day for Apollo 17,

16
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:22,498
the last round trip to the moon
that Americans may take in this century.

17
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:26,794
Now anyone can turn their ordinary TV
into a magic box of video games.

18
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:32,299
I, Gerald R. Ford, do solemnly swear
that I will faithfully execute...

19
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:36,678
We must whip inflation right now.

20
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:40,349
What was being called peace with honor
only a few short months ago

21
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:44,394
has disintegrated into utter chaos
as the US evacuates...

22
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,604
Light this place up.

23
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:48,524
Get on the dance floor!
Come on! Everybody, now!

24
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,026
The streaking craze continues
to take the nation by storm

25
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:56,907
as college students across the country
are shedding their clothes.

26
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:02,037
Happy 200th birthday, America,

27
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,873
and many, many more!

28
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:09,002
...I will faithfully execute the office
of the president of the United States.

29
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:11,046
...the office of president
ofthe United States.

30
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,550
Billy Beer hit the shelves this week.
The White House has no comment

31
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:17,052
on the latest business venture
of President Carter's brother.

32
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:20,931
As President Carter
prohibited the purchase of Iranian oil,

33
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:25,060
Americans again find themselves in
long gas lines with another oil crisis.

34
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:29,314
Governor Brown
reviewed his plan for gas rationing...

35
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:33,443
Funeral arrangements for singer
Elvis Presley have not been announced.

36
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:37,656
The entertainer died Tuesday in Memphis
from cardiac arrhythmia.

37
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,159
Breaker one-eight northbound, over.

38
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,914
Mr. Carter approved
emergency financial aid

39
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,750
for the Love Canal area
of Niagara Falls, New York,

40
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:53,255
in crisis because of chemical leakage
in the landfill on which it's built.

41
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:57,092
Authorities are saying there's been
an uncontrolled release of radiation

42
00:02:57,218 --> 00:03:01,471
from the Three Mile Island nuclear
facility, but details are still unclear.

43
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:06,602
It is a crisis of confidence.
It is a crisis that strikes

44
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:10,814
at the very heart and soul
and spirit of our national will.

45
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,400
The symptoms of this crisis...

46
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:22,159
USA Hockey. Please hold.

47
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:24,119
USA Hockey.

48
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:27,873
He's just stepping into a meeting.

49
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:30,375
When's the best time to reach you?

50
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:34,421
He's got your number? OK.

51
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,716
- Herb.
- Hey, Walter. How we doing?

52
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,303
- Good to see you. How was the flight?
- Not bad.

53
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:44,848
That's great.
Everybody's waiting to see us.

54
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:48,644
- Who-all's here?
- Anybody who's got a say in this thing.

55
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:51,605
Bob Fleming,
the International Council, USA Hockey,

56
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,482
Lou Nanne from the NHL.

57
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:56,318
The only way we can compete
with Eastern Bloc teams

58
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:58,737
is ifwe're willing to change.

59
00:03:58,821 --> 00:03:59,821
Change what?

60
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:03,158
The way we train, the way we prepare.
Even change our schedule.

61
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,993
What kind of schedule changes?

62
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:08,413
I think we need to make it longer,
tougher, much more competitive.

63
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,249
Longer? You gonna pay for that?

64
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:14,169
We also need to change
the way we play the game.

65
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:19,925
- What exactly does that mean?
- My plan is to adopt a new style.

66
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:23,220
A hybrid of the Soviet school
and the Canadian school.

67
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:28,517
A combination that requires the highest
level of conditioning, speed, creativity

68
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,936
and, most of all, team chemistry.

69
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,730
Is this what you use
at the University of Minnesota?

70
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,899
We've been phasing it in, yeah, but...

71
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:38,610
He has won three NCAA titles.

72
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,988
Walter, we don't have years,
we have months.

73
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:46,785
Can you teach a bunch of kids that have
never played together a whole new style?

74
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:47,869
OK, look...

75
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,706
What if these kids
can't pick it up fast enough?

76
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,333
We all know we're
a long shot for a medal,

77
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:57,254
- but we don't want to get embarrassed.
- That's right.

78
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:59,464
Bob, four years ago,

79
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:03,468
our Olympic team lost
to the Czech B-team 15 to one.

80
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:06,930
I don't think we can embarrass ourselves
any more than that.

81
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:09,933
That's assuming they don't go pro.

82
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:14,229
I'd have a hard time giving up good
money to finish sixth at Lake Placid.

83
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:17,649
It's a tough draw, Herb. Tough draw.

84
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:21,403
It's tough even ifwe don't play
the Soviets. What happens ifwe do?

85
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:25,240
We put our best on the ice with them
last year. Professional all-stars.

86
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:28,327
- They still beat us.
- Not because you weren't good enough.

87
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:39,588
All-star teams fail because they rely
solely on the individuals' talent.

88
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:43,091
The Soviets win
because they take that talent and use it

89
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:46,261
in a system designed
for the betterment of the team.

90
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:50,349
My goal is to beat them
at their own game.

91
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,309
Beat the best team in the world.

92
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:55,937
Gold medalists
in '64, '68, '72 and '76.

93
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,940
It's a pretty lofty goal, Herb.

94
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:03,028
Lou, that's why I wanna pursue it.

95
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:08,033
Well, fellas, any more questions?

96
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:09,993
- I'm good.
- No.

97
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,788
That's it for me. Thanks very much.

98
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:16,249
- Herb, thanks.
- Thank you, Bob. I appreciate it.

99
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:31,973
- Hey.
- It's coming down out there.

100
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:37,104
- Where are the kids?
- I gave them away.

101
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,899
How did it go?

102
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:42,984
I'm not their guy.

103
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:49,408
They only had me come out there
because two other coaches said no.

104
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:52,035
I think they're
still looking East Coast.

105
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:57,165
- What's that?
- It's a costume party, Herb. Come on.

106
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,251
Nick and Nora Charles. The Thin Man.

107
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:01,336
- You're gonna make me wear this?
- Yes.

108
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:04,005
They're sophisticated and dashing.

109
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,676
I've got a mustache for you
and a little dog for me.

110
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,519
Excuse me.

111
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:27,487
- Linda, can you get that for me?
- Oh, sure.

112
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:32,868
Hello. Yes, just a moment, please.

113
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:36,371
Patti, it's for Herb.
Someone from the USOC.

114
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:48,550
- No.
- It's eight-nothing!

115
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:51,511
It's gonna be a dramatic comeback.

116
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,013
Go.

117
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:55,682
- Herb.
- Yeah.

118
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,476
Herb.

119
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,103
You've got a call from Colorado.

120
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,940
We're not done here.

121
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:10,071
So then he went along with that?

122
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:14,784
I appreciate that, Walter. Thank you.

123
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:19,831
- What'd they say?
- I got the job.

124
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:24,669
- I got the job. How about that?
- Oh, great.

125
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,421
- When do you start?
- Two weeks.

126
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:30,342
- They want you to start that soon?
- The Games are in February.

127
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:33,011
But it's June. Is there even ice?

128
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:35,347
Mommy. Mommy, Mommy.

129
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:38,183
We're supposed to take the kids
to the Black Hills.

130
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,644
Cleopatra wants to say goodbye to you.

131
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:44,606
- OK. OK.
- I gotta call Craig Patrick right now.

132
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,838
How you doing? Phil Verchota.

133
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,259
- Name?
- Ralph Cox, UNH.

134
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:15,262
- Name, please?
- Mike Ramsey.

135
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:21,935
- Number, towel. Jack O'Callahan, right?
- Last time I checked.

136
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,521
- Good luck, Jack. Who's next?
- Thanks, buddy.

137
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,401
Jimmy Craig.

138
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,403
- Hey, Jack.
- What's up, you sieve?

139
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:33,154
- How's it going?
- Good.

140
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,282
Any reason why Joey Mullen's not here?

141
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:39,202
About 30,000 of them, all sitting
in his New York bank account.

142
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:43,915
- He got a $30,000 signing bonus?
- Crazy, isn't it?

143
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,667
How's it looking?

144
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:50,171
A lot of guys from Minnesota and Boston.

145
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:54,050
Yeah, that's gonna work.

146
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,525
You're Robbie McClanahan, right?

147
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:15,530
- Yeah.
- Mike Eruzione. Boston University.

148
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:20,660
- '76.
- '76.

149
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:24,122
Trying to play for Brooks a little more?

150
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:28,668
I played for him for four years.
A few more months wouldn't hurt.

151
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:31,379
What about you?

152
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:34,549
Trying to play a little more hockey,
that's all.

153
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,010
The rest of your boys all here?

154
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:40,555
Of course.
Think they'd miss out on this?

155
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:44,934
You might wanna wait a day or so
before you go over and say hi.

156
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,063
Check!

157
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:50,148
Come on, hit those lines!

158
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:52,567
Head for the net! The net!

159
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,496
Skate, boys! Skate!

160
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,997
Skate!

161
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,500
Drop your shoulder!

162
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:10,085
On the wing!

163
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,848
Man, look at that move.

164
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,517
Rizzo!

165
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,273
Eruzione?

166
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:35,944
Cross him off the list. He doesn't have
a shot in hell at making this team.

167
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,279
- You think so?
- No way.

168
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,789
One more.

169
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,648
Doc cleared him.
Says it's just a sprain.

170
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,316
Good.

171
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:23,908
I just want to let you know I'm looking
forward to being able to coach with you.

172
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:26,536
You were a hell of a player, Craig.

173
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,789
- You're gonna make a hell of a coach.
- Thanks.

174
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:34,002
I need you to stick tight with these
kids. Any big problems, let me know.

175
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:37,255
- Otherwise you take care of it, OK?
- OK.

176
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:44,596
- Take a look at that.
- What's this?

177
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,723
Twenty-six names.

178
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:54,355
The tough part is getting it down to 20
before the opening ceremonies.

179
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,566
This is the final roster?

180
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,862
You're kidding me, right?

181
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:09,913
This is our first day.
We got a week of this.

182
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,501
Aren't the advisory staff
supposed to have a say in this?

183
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,878
Technically, I guess.

184
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,427
You're missing some of the best players.

185
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:27,847
Not looking for the best players,
looking for the right ones.

186
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:33,186
You have Jim Craig to back up Janaszak?

187
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:37,190
- Other way round.
- Other way round?

188
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:39,901
Didn't Janaszakjust win you
a national championship?

189
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:45,031
He's a solid goaltender, but we're
not playing for a national championship.

190
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:51,496
People say Craig's game's been off
since his mom died.

191
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:55,500
Did they ever see him
when his game was on?

192
00:13:56,836 --> 00:14:02,841
Hughes. Ross. Auge. Delich.

193
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:07,095
Horsch. Strobel. Christoff.

194
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:12,600
Morrow. Suter. Ramsey.

195
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:16,896
Janaszak. Christian.

196
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:19,983
Pavelich. Verchota.

197
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:25,363
Baker. Harrington. Schneider.

198
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:29,826
O'Callahan. McClanahan.

199
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,289
Silk. Johnson.

200
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,292
Craig. Cox.

201
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,211
Eruzione.

202
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,505
That's the roster for now.

203
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,008
The rest of you, thanks for coming out.

204
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:06,404
Way to go, Rizzo.

205
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:16,414
Take a good look, gentlemen.

206
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:18,917
'Cause they're the ones
getting off easy.

207
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,504
I'm putting a few of you on reserve

208
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:27,508
in case somebody gets injured
or their game goes to hell.

209
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:33,598
The final roster will have 20 names
on it, so more of you are going home.

210
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:37,602
If you give 99 percent,
you'll make my job very, very easy.

211
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:41,314
I'll be your coach, not your friend.

212
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:46,152
If you need one of those,
take it up with Doc or Coach Patrick.

213
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:51,532
All right, gentlemen.

214
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:54,911
Congratulations to all of you.
That's it for today.

215
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:58,790
On the way out, pick up one of these.
You've got a little homework to do

216
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,208
before you celebrate.

217
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,089
Thank you.

218
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:15,723
Herb! Herb!

219
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,850
Hold on a minute.

220
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:22,897
- Hey, Walter. How we doing?
- I think we got a problem here.

221
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:24,774
What's that?

222
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:28,569
I got a room full of people
who want a say in this process

223
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,738
and you've already picked the team.

224
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:34,367
- Look, Walter...
- No! There's a right way to do this.

225
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,202
And this is not it.

226
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:40,289
If I was in your shoes,
I'd probably be saying the same thing.

227
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:43,710
All right. Let's go upstairs.

228
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:47,422
We'll help piece together a hockey team.
All of us. Together.

229
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:50,258
Walter, that's just not gonna happen.

230
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:54,554
Do you realize what the AHA went through
to put this thing together?

231
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:58,933
The best amateur players in the country
on the ice for a week, notjust a day.

232
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,894
I didn't ask for that.
I already know my team.

233
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:06,524
How? Those kids have been on the ice
for a couple of hours.

234
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:09,902
Every one of them
was chosen for a specific reason.

235
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:14,741
I've studied film on every one of them.
I've seen them, coached a lot of them.

236
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:18,202
The ones I haven't, I've spoken
with their coaches. And scouts.

237
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:22,665
I know best what I need to compete.
The team I've chosen is it.

238
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:26,085
What am I supposed to say
to the advisory board?

239
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,336
Tell 'em the truth.

240
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:31,174
This puts me in a hell of a spot, Herb.
A hell of a spot!

241
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:33,801
They hired me to do a job.
I'm trying to do it.

242
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:44,103
All right. I'm gonna back you on this.

243
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,149
But I sure as hell hope
you know what you're doing.

244
00:17:57,117 --> 00:18:01,954
- Phillie, what are you at?
- My test is done.

245
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:05,458
- Me and Janny are done.
- Are you done?

246
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:10,880
You're stopped by a policeman
but you're not at fault.

247
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:13,424
Do you state your disagreement
right away?

248
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:17,220
He's got 300 of these things.

249
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:20,389
It's a test. You've taken
one or two before.

250
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:23,434
- Not to play hockey.
- Can you even read?

251
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:26,020
I try.

252
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:27,230
Hey, Rizzo.

253
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:32,110
- What's going on?
- Mac.

254
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,701
Easy, big guy.

255
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:43,496
I don't know how you two can sit
in the same room with that clown.

256
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,623
Let it go. It's over.

257
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:51,671
- What's going on?
- OC's got a little unfinished business.

258
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:55,007
- Not for long.
- What did I tell you?

259
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:02,390
McClanahan? You're not still going on
about the '76 playoffs?

260
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:05,101
Come on, OC. It was three years ago.

261
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:08,062
Coxy, let me ask you a question.

262
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,231
Why did you wanna play college hockey?

263
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:14,110
- Isn't it obvious? For the girls.
- I'm serious, Coxy.

264
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:16,529
Why did you wanna play college hockey?

265
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:21,868
'Cause I love to play hockey. I wanna go
to the NHL like everybody does.

266
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,078
I wanted to win a national championship.

267
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,914
That pansy over there cheap-shots me.

268
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,083
I get tossed out of the game.

269
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,335
He steals the ring right off my finger.

270
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,796
How would you feel?

271
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:36,090
Everyone was throwing cheap shots.

272
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:40,344
Rizzo, it's funny you say that.
I was wondering what side you're on.

273
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:44,015
- I'm on your side.
- It really seems that way.

274
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:46,517
All right, just relax, OK? Jeez.

275
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:50,479
I'm not doing this right now.
I'm outta here.

276
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,190
Where you going?

277
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:57,195
To my room.
Is that all right with you... mother?

278
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,156
Just let him go.

279
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:04,410
No wonder that guy
gets so many penalty minutes.

280
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:07,997
He gets a little carried away sometimes.

281
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:13,127
That's it. Pick it up. That's it.

282
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,378
Pick it up!

283
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:18,049
Look for the pass.
Hit him with a pass. Go, Johnson.

284
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:19,133
Outside!

285
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:22,011
Johnson, hit him on the other side.

286
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:23,596
Silk, keep it up.

287
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:28,184
Hit him, Johnson. He's open.

288
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:30,561
Come on, Johnson.

289
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:34,106
Johnson.

290
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:39,070
Coast-to-coast stuffwon't work
against the teams we'll be playing.

291
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:40,988
OK.

292
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:44,492
Next lineup. Let's go.
Let's run it again.

293
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:49,455
Morrow. Let me take this one.

294
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,586
Don't worry. Keep your head up.

295
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:58,005
This is a breakout play, gentlemen.

296
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,675
So please let's get rid
of the puck early.

297
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:03,010
All right, let's go.

298
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:24,615
- What are you hitting like that for?
- That's bush league, OC.

299
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,242
Nice hit, OC.

300
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:29,537
Tell your boy here to keep his head up.

301
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,455
You all right?

302
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,040
Let's go.

303
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:39,005
Craig. Let them go.

304
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,679
- Stay out of it.
- Stay out of it, Buzzy.

305
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:53,352
- What are you doing?
- Stay out of it, Baker.

306
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:58,691
Come on, OC, let him have it.

307
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:00,651
Come on, OC.

308
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,737
There you go, beat him.

309
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,199
That's it.

310
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,286
How about it, boys?

311
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,330
Look like hockey to you?

312
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:16,250
Looks more like a couple monkeys
humping a football to me.

313
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:19,920
- What do you think, Craig?
- Yeah.

314
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:25,134
You wanna settle old scores,
you're on the wrong team.

315
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,929
We move forward, starting right now.

316
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:32,266
We start becoming a team right now.

317
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:39,690
Skating. Passing.

318
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,486
Flow and creativity.

319
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:46,405
That is what this team
is all about, gentlemen.

320
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:49,700
Not old rivalries.

321
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:56,123
So why don't we start with some
introductions? Get to know each other.

322
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,544
Where you're from, who you are.
Go ahead.

323
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,929
Rob McClanahan. Saint Paul, Minnesota.

324
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:13,974
- Who do you play for?
- For you, here at the U.

325
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,020
Jack?

326
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:24,777
Jack O'Callahan. Charlestown, Mass.

327
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,571
Boston University.

328
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:30,991
Over here.

329
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:36,080
I'm Ralph Cox.

330
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:39,792
I'm from wherever's
not gonna get me hit.

331
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:45,923
Very good.
Everybody on the line. Let's go.

332
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:56,517
- Hey, Jim.
- Hey, coach.

333
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:59,603
I was wondering
why you wouldn't take this test.

334
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:05,693
Yeah, well...
It's nothing against you or anything.

335
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:08,612
I didn't see what it has to do
with stopping a puck.

336
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:12,241
That's all right.
You just took it anyway.

337
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:24,378
Hey, coach?

338
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:28,883
So if I took it...

339
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:32,219
I meant to ask,
how's your family doing?

340
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:35,890
They're doing all right.

341
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:38,017
And you?

342
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:41,395
I'm OK.

343
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:46,317
I got 26 guys trying to make this team.
Only 20 will go to Lake Placid.

344
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:49,945
I gotta know how committed
you are to being here.

345
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:53,699
If you're not,
you're just wasting our time.

346
00:24:57,454 --> 00:25:02,333
Look, coach, my dad's
going through a rough time right now.

347
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,378
He's got nothing.

348
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:11,133
He lost his job.
And with Atlanta trying to sign me...

349
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:18,766
Bottom line is, my mom wanted this.

350
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:22,436
Me playing on this team.

351
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:27,942
Hard to say no to someone who drove
you to practice every day, right?

352
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:30,819
You didn't answer my question, Jim.

353
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:34,073
I'm here, aren't I?

354
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,871
I'll see you in the morning.

355
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:44,458
Don't forget to bring your game.

356
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:59,139
The Soviets performed
a nuclear test yesterday,

357
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:03,978
setting off a 75-kiloton bomb
in eastern Kazakhstan...

358
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:07,147
- So much hate and fear.
- What's that?

359
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:11,819
Between the Soviets and the West.
It's bound to end in disaster.

360
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:15,072
They'll figure something out, Doc.

361
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:17,408
They haven't got
any other choice, right?

362
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:22,496
I hope so, but itjust seems to me
that some people will never get along.

363
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,582
Yeah.

364
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:28,002
Like hockey players
from Boston and Minnesota.

365
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:31,338
Our own private cold war.

366
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:37,678
- Let me ask you a question.
- Of course.

367
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:40,014
You've worked with Herb
for a long time?

368
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,515
Quite some time.

369
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,810
Does he always treat
his players like this?

370
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:49,732
No. This I have never seen.

371
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:52,234
But, Craig, believe me.

372
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:55,070
Herb has a reason
for everything he does.

373
00:26:57,699 --> 00:27:02,161
Well, he's ending up with 20 players
who hate his guts.

374
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:05,748
Maybe if they hate him,
they won't have time to hate each other.

375
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:31,065
Hey, honey.

376
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:34,902
- How much longer you gonna be?
- I still got a few more.

377
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:40,783
- Well, I'm going to bed, OK?
- OK.

378
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:44,328
You know, Kelly
has ballet at four tomorrow,

379
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:47,331
and Danny's done with hockey then too.

380
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:50,417
Which one do you wanna get?

381
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:51,919
- Herb.
- Yeah.

382
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:55,756
- Can you pick up Danny at four?
- We've got team meetings.

383
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:58,050
I can't be in two places.

384
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:00,511
- What about Margie?
- They're on vacation.

385
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:04,223
I don't know, honey.
You'll figure it out.

386
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:06,308
Can you turn that off, please?

387
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:10,104
Please.

388
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,860
This is what happens
over the summer.

389
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:21,115
The kids are doing a zillion different
things. Your meetings will have to wait.

390
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:24,410
Come on, Patti.
I'm coaching a hockey team here.

391
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:26,453
We already talked about this.

392
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:29,873
Really?
When exactly did we have this talk?

393
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:32,751
Because I don't recall
being a part of the conversation.

394
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:36,964
What did I say? Was it interesting?

395
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:38,882
We never had this talk.

396
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,801
Never.

397
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:44,680
OK, what's on your mind?

398
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:48,892
- Nothing.
- You're obviously mad about something.

399
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:51,311
First you're upset
because we didn't talk,

400
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:55,315
and then when I try to talk
about whatever it is, you don't wanna.

401
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:59,486
- If you're not willing...
- It's not because we didn't talk.

402
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:02,531
It's because you never even asked.

403
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:09,329
I know what this is about.
I know it and you know it.

404
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:13,083
- What? Know what?
- This. What you're doing.

405
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:17,337
Chasing after something you didn't get.
That you may never get.

406
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:24,219
What if it doesn't work out?

407
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:26,555
Are we gonna do this every four years?

408
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:35,105
It's OK. Go finish your work. Go, go.

409
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:28,802
Hey.

410
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:33,265
You know...

411
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:37,352
...ever since I stopped playing,

412
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,106
I wanted to coach this team.

413
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:46,987
And this is the only way
I know how to do it.

414
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:51,366
It's not the easiest way,
I know, for you. Or the kids. But...

415
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:57,164
Patti, I have to do this.

416
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,126
I know you do.

417
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:18,518
I'm sorry we didn't talk.

418
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:21,021
And I was wrong not to ask.

419
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:27,945
So I'm asking now
if you can be with me on this

420
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:32,074
because it won't mean anything
if you're not.

421
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:52,970
Blue line, back. Red line, back.

422
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:55,514
Far blue line, back. Far red line, back.

423
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:58,100
And you have 45 seconds to do it.

424
00:32:58,184 --> 00:33:01,937
Get used to this drill.
We'll be doing it a lot.

425
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:05,399
Why?

426
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:09,528
Because the legs
feed the wolf, gentlemen.

427
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:16,076
I can't promise you we'll be the best
team at Lake Placid next February.

428
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:23,125
But we will be the best conditioned.
That I can promise you.

429
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:29,214
Be prepared to grow
through pain, gentlemen.

430
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:32,092
You're gonna skate
harder than you've ever skated

431
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:34,928
every minute of every day
you're on the ice with me.

432
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:37,764
Stretch out north and south,
open up east and west.

433
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:42,019
The center will fill in here.
This winger will take the center spot.

434
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:43,854
- What's your name?
- Mark Johnson.

435
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:46,189
- Where are you from?
- Madison, Wisconsin.

436
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:49,276
- Who do you play for?
- University of Wisconsin.

437
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,988
Come on. Go, boys! Go, boys!

438
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:58,160
The fastest way to make this team
is by being fast.

439
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:04,958
Stop. Look at you.
Three men covered by one guy.

440
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:07,961
This isn't weaving for weaving's sake.

441
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,464
Spread out. Use the ice.

442
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:15,677
Come on, Jimmy. Challenge them.

443
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:19,139
You're getting beat on the side.
Challenge them.

444
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,435
I don't blame you.

445
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:26,646
- How you holding up?
- Not good, not good.

446
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,523
- How about you?
- Dave Christian.

447
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,984
- Who do you play for?
- University of North Dakota.

448
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,194
Come on, no!

449
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:36,573
No, no, no. Get it to a point.
You're quarterbacking this play.

450
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:38,950
Come on, Rizzo,
I got you running this play.

451
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:41,453
The only thing you're gonna run
is the bench.

452
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:44,498
Boom. He can get him.
Boom, boom, boom.

453
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:48,752
We're opening up options.
We've got four options off one play.

454
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:51,338
Anybody have any questions?

455
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:54,841
OK, let's go.

456
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:56,968
- What is he talking about?
- No clue.

457
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:03,183
Twenty of you are going to Lake Placid.
Six are going home.

458
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:05,519
Who that is, believe it or not,
is up to you.

459
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:07,145
- You?
- Mark Pavelich.

460
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:09,106
- Who do you play for?
- UMD Bulldogs.

461
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,859
Go. Next lineup.

462
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:16,154
- Turn it up, boys.
- Let's move it.

463
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,536
Here you go, here you go!

464
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:28,375
- Fabulous pass.
- Good shot.

465
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:31,253
You three, run that again.

466
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,005
- Again?
- Let's go.

467
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:42,055
I understand how you feel,
but don't let them know that.

468
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:48,145
- The Coneheads are coming in.
- Who?

469
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:52,607
That's what the guys have been
calling them 'cause they're a little...

470
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,693
Like the Coneheads.

471
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:58,613
- What's that?
- Dan Aykroyd, Jane Curtin.

472
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:02,033
I guess it's off your radar.

473
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:08,123
- Come on in, boys.
- You want to see us, coach?

474
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:13,503
I'm thinking about keeping the three
of you together on the same line.

475
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:16,882
- Everybody OK with that?
- Yeah. Sure.

476
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:19,217
How about you, Buzzy,
think this works?

477
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:24,347
It's going good. Moving the puck well.
It's just different playing with them.

478
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:28,560
We just seem to find each other
and make things happen.

479
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:30,228
Yeah. Pass, shoot, score.

480
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:32,147
- Pass, shoot
- and score.

481
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:37,903
Well, all right. We'll see how she goes.

482
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:41,948
- Thanks, coach.
- Take it easy.

483
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:44,534
Rest up.

484
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:50,498
Well, looks like we're taking a line
of Coneheads to Europe.

485
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:54,628
Yeah.
If they can keep their legs under them.

486
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:02,302
I'll see you next week.

487
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:06,348
Something on your mind, Craig?

488
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:09,309
Or is thatjust too far off my radar?

489
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:18,526
I don't think you can push them
this hard for six months. It's too long.

490
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:20,987
- They're doing all right.
- They're tired.

491
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:25,825
- I know how hard to push them, Craig.
- You sure about that?

492
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,911
You know why I had them take that test?

493
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:30,330
To make sure
I could push them this hard.

494
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:31,706
I'll see you Monday.

495
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:35,335
All right.

496
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,875
Wow, look over here, Phillie.

497
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,295
Section two, four rows up.

498
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:22,132
- Two girls, blonde.
- They're gorgeous.

499
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:31,933
- Twins. Seventh row up, to the right.
- Love these blonde girls.

500
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:36,229
- Maybe we can take a few home.
- Must be something in the water.

501
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,537
Get a whistle.

502
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:15,018
Hold up. Hold up, hold up.

503
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:17,562
You gotta get back on the ice. Let's go.

504
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:21,107
- What for?
- You'll find out soon. Come on.

505
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,985
- What for?
- We'll find out in a minute. Come on.

506
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,988
Let's go see what he wants.

507
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:41,294
You guys don't wanna work during
the game? No problem. We'll work now.

508
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,463
Goal line.

509
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:45,673
That one.

510
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:37,934
Hustle.

511
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:43,106
Think you can win on talent alone?

512
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:47,777
Gentlemen, you don't have enough talent
to win on talent alone.

513
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:49,946
Again.

514
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:11,718
You think you can play
the Norwegian national team and tie them

515
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:14,637
and then go to the Olympics and win?

516
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:17,807
You got another thing coming.

517
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,738
You gotta think about something else,
each and every one of you.

518
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:34,115
When you pull on thatjersey,

519
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,826
you represent yourself
and your teammates.

520
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:41,206
The name on the front is a lot
more important than the one on the back.

521
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:44,709
Get that through your head! Again.

522
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:08,233
Win, lose or tie,
you're gonna play like champions.

523
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:10,735
Again.

524
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:20,578
Kick it in the ass, Verchota.
Wanna go home early?

525
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:24,374
Keep it going, Suter. All the way
to the line and all the way back.

526
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:27,627
It's not that difficult. Again.

527
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:39,931
Again.

528
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:44,852
- Herb.
- What?

529
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:49,774
The rink manager, he wants
to clean the ice and go home.

530
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:53,861
Tell him to leave me the keys.
I'll lock up. Again.

531
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:56,990
Again.

532
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:15,842
You keep playing this way,

533
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:19,721
you won't beat anybody
who's even good, let alone great.

534
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:24,017
If you wanna make this team,
you better start playing at a level

535
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:27,437
that's gonna force me to keep you here.

536
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:28,980
Again.

537
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:40,033
I think we're getting out of here.

538
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:44,829
Hey. Where you going?

539
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:48,041
Back on the line.

540
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:55,423
Again.

541
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:58,593
Send 'em.

542
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:12,899
Again.

543
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:17,111
Silky, you gonna be
the first to quit on me?

544
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:20,531
How about you, OC?
You ready to go down?

545
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:22,909
I think I've got my money
on you, Verchota.

546
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:24,702
You got a hot date in an hour,

547
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:29,123
but you're not looking too good
for that right about now, are you?

548
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:30,667
Send 'em.

549
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:35,922
Again.

550
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,397
Doc, this is madness, right?

551
00:44:59,613 --> 00:45:02,782
This cannot be a team of common men

552
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:06,577
because common men go nowhere.

553
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,955
You have to be uncommon.

554
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:13,876
- Again.
- Herb.

555
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:17,380
- This has gone on long enough.
- Everybody, on that line.

556
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:20,299
Somebody's going to get hurt.

557
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:26,848
Everybody, get on that line.

558
00:45:29,017 --> 00:45:30,977
Hey.

559
00:45:37,484 --> 00:45:45,032
Again.

560
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:49,996
Herb.

561
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:52,039
Come on, Craig. Blow the whistle.

562
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:55,626
Again.

563
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:01,299
Mike Eruzione.

564
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:11,726
Winthrop, Massachusetts.

565
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,442
Who do you play for?

566
00:46:20,694 --> 00:46:24,614
I play for the United States ofAmerica.

567
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:32,705
That's all, gentlemen.

568
00:46:57,481 --> 00:47:01,734
You Minnesotans, my back's
starting to hurt from carrying y'all.

569
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:03,736
Pretend you're pushing cows.

570
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:07,490
Stop talking, Boston boy,
and start pushing.

571
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:09,992
- What you got there?
- Three nines.

572
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:11,953
Not bad, not bad.

573
00:47:12,037 --> 00:47:14,038
I got two sevens.

574
00:47:14,122 --> 00:47:20,127
We're taxiing out to the runway, right,
and we kind of hit a moose.

575
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:24,465
No, the moose is fine, but we gotta
make sure the airplane's all right.

576
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:28,636
So the boys are pushing it back
so these guys can take a look at it.

577
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:33,182
Patti, the moose is OK.
It ran off. I saw it.

578
00:47:34,768 --> 00:47:38,771
So, what's going on at home?

579
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:41,858
...between the NHL All-Stars
and the Soviet Union.

580
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:43,901
She did, huh?

581
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:49,156
The Soviets dominated
the NHL's best from start to finish,

582
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:51,909
winning by a score of six to nothing.

583
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:55,788
The Soviets, led by the superb play
of their captain, Boris Mikhailov,

584
00:47:55,914 --> 00:47:59,417
were superior to the NHL stars
in every way tonight.

585
00:47:59,459 --> 00:48:02,211
Their passing was crisper,
their offense relentless

586
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:04,881
and their conditioning superb.

587
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:06,757
No, I'm here. I'm listening.

588
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,801
A six to nothing win tonight.

589
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:12,263
An embarrassing evening
for the NHL All-Stars.

590
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:27,945
Russian style of play, boys.

591
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:30,990
Fluid, creative.

592
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:34,452
The forwards are constantly circling.

593
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:38,873
They don't so much look for a man
as a patch of ice.

594
00:48:38,957 --> 00:48:42,209
You get the mismatch.
Two on one. Easy goal.

595
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:45,671
Looks a lot like me
out there, huh, boys?

596
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:52,136
Boris Mikhailov.
Captain for the last six years.

597
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:54,889
He is the best player at his position,

598
00:48:54,973 --> 00:48:59,101
and that includes,
as we've just found out, the NHL.

599
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:00,686
These guys ever smile?

600
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:03,731
They're Russians,
they get shot if they smile.

601
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:09,153
Vladislav Tretyak.

602
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:14,325
You score on Tretyak, keep the puck.
It doesn't happen often.

603
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:19,372
Forty-two games in
the last three months. Forty-two wins.

604
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:23,376
Their main weapon is intimidation.

605
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,670
They know they're gonna win.

606
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:27,797
And so do their opponents.

607
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:49,485
Look, I can give you all a load of crap

608
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:52,113
about how you're
a better team than them,

609
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:55,449
but that's exactly what it'd be.

610
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:58,786
Everyone here knows what people
are saying about our chances.

611
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:01,038
I know it. You know it.

612
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:07,753
But I also know there is a way
to stay with this team.

613
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:16,095
You don't defend them. You attack them.

614
00:50:17,222 --> 00:50:20,516
You take their game
and shove it right back in their face.

615
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,644
The team that
is finally willing to do this

616
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:27,857
is the team
that has a chance to put them down.

617
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:34,113
NHL won't change their game. We will.

618
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:38,784
The rest of the world is afraid of them.

619
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:41,162
Boys, we won't be.

620
00:50:44,791 --> 00:50:48,586
No one has ever worked hard enough

621
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:53,591
to skate with the Soviet team
for an entire game.

622
00:50:54,926 --> 00:50:59,930
Gentlemen,
we are gonna work hard enough.

623
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:04,560
Quick feet, boys. Push it.

624
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:09,231
Work hard, boys.
Strobel, pick up your knees.

625
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:11,442
Keep your shoulders square.

626
00:51:11,943 --> 00:51:14,653
Push it. Come on, boys. Go.

627
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:19,158
The legs feed the wolf, boys.
The legs feed the wolf.

628
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:24,038
Stay with him, Jimmy.
Stay with him, Jimmy.

629
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:26,499
Damn it!

630
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:43,682
How's your legs?

631
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:46,727
I'll let you know
when I can feel them.

632
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:49,313
Come on, boys.
Go get him. Go get him.

633
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:50,856
Thattaboy, Jimmy.

634
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:54,985
Better. Not good, but better.

635
00:51:57,239 --> 00:52:01,117
Pedal to the metal. Intensity, boys.

636
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:03,119
There you go, there you go.

637
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:06,205
Work it, boys. Quick feet. Push it.

638
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:16,799
Tape to tape, boys.
Passes come from the heart.

639
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:22,847
We wanna stretch things out.
We got the Coneheads on the line.

640
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:25,891
- Take me through it.
- I stretch the D out and across.

641
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:28,894
- What do we do with this space?
- I fill the open lane.

642
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:30,938
- I fill in for Pav's lane.
- Exactly.

643
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,151
That's it, that's it.

644
00:52:57,257 --> 00:53:00,301
Don't let them have it, Jimmy.
Attaboy, attaboy. Yeah!

645
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:03,888
Build your legs up, boys.
Build your legs!

646
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:08,934
You'll have nothing left in the third
period if you don't build your legs now.

647
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:11,395
- What does that give us, boys?
- Options.

648
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:13,439
All right. Let's run it.

649
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:17,276
- Let's go.
- What's going on?

650
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:19,945
We play the Soviets
three days before Lake Placid?

651
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,447
Yeah. How about that?

652
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:24,950
How about that?

653
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:28,120
How about that.

654
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:34,877
Rizzo, you're killing me.
Why can't you find the net?

655
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:39,215
You've been staring at the same piece
of paper since dinner. Take a break.

656
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,636
How do I cut this kid?
He's done everything I've asked.

657
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,304
So keep him.

658
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:49,642
I didn't think
it was gonna be this hard.

659
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:53,187
Yeah, you did.

660
00:53:57,192 --> 00:54:01,779
This isn't gonna work.
I could stick Christian on defense.

661
00:54:03,114 --> 00:54:07,284
I bet that works. Baker.

662
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:11,747
They stormed the embassy,
overpowered the Marine Guard

663
00:54:11,831 --> 00:54:14,291
and took dozens ofAmerican hostages.

664
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:16,669
Oh, my God.

665
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,674
Herb. Herb.

666
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:23,717
Turn around and look at this.

667
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:27,179
...used tear-gas to try to disperse
the mob of Islamic students.

668
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:28,514
But that wasn't enough.

669
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:32,101
Hundreds of Iranians
finally overran the embassy compound,

670
00:54:32,185 --> 00:54:35,562
seizing about 90 people,
mostly Americans.

671
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:40,276
The hostages were blindfolded
and herded into the embassy's basement.

672
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:43,862
Earlier today the Ayatollah Khomeini...

673
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:48,033
You gave those guys a good schooling.

674
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:57,626
How about Johnson and McClanahan?
That works.

675
00:54:57,711 --> 00:55:00,254
They're starting to come together.

676
00:55:00,338 --> 00:55:03,340
- Thanks for coming up.
- I wouldn't have missed it.

677
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:05,426
- Hey, you beat Harvard.
- Yeah.

678
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:12,266
I should probably get going.

679
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:14,476
Yeah.

680
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:18,314
I love you, Pop.

681
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,568
You too, son.

682
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:28,449
Jimmy. You keep that glove up.

683
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:30,534
You got it.

684
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:46,633
- Switch.
- Rizzo's making dinner. Meatballs.

685
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:49,553
You boys keep eating them,
I'll keep making them.

686
00:55:49,637 --> 00:55:51,722
You have to be insane to eat them.

687
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:53,891
No offense, Rizzo.

688
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:57,770
How will it affect
the boys' chemistry?

689
00:55:57,854 --> 00:55:59,271
I don't know. We'll see.

690
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:02,358
Timmy.

691
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:12,743
- Who the hell is that?
- What's he doing here?

692
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:18,207
- How you doing, Tim? Good to see you.
- Thanks.

693
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:21,460
Who's that?

694
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:25,756
Timmy Harrer. Plays for the Gophers.
Having a big year.

695
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:29,593
- What the hell's he doing here?
- No idea.

696
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:33,263
- Why's he here?
- You guys know he was coming?

697
00:56:33,306 --> 00:56:37,601
Why don't you warm up, stretch out,
then jump on Johnson's line for today?

698
00:56:37,685 --> 00:56:39,645
Good to have you.

699
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:57,413
See you, boys.

700
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:08,590
This is ridiculous.

701
00:57:09,175 --> 00:57:11,427
Don't worry, Rammer.
It'll be all right.

702
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:13,595
Right, OC?

703
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,014
Herb's not gonna do
a damn thing, boys.

704
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:18,851
He's just messing with our minds.

705
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:20,978
You think so, Jack?

706
00:57:22,355 --> 00:57:25,065
Yeah, I do.

707
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:27,860
We all know Herb
made the Olympic team back in '60.

708
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:29,445
So?

709
00:57:29,529 --> 00:57:30,946
A week before the Games,

710
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:34,199
Coach Riley calls him
in his office and sends him home.

711
00:57:35,034 --> 00:57:38,078
- What's your point?
- My point, Jack,

712
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:43,876
is that one week later, Herb's home
watching his team win the gold medal.

713
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:46,211
Come that close and get nothing?

714
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:51,133
He'll do whatever it takes.
That's my point.

715
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:57,556
Yeah, I'm aware of that, Walter.

716
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:03,061
Yeah. Yeah, well, you've talked
to everybody else, right?

717
00:58:04,063 --> 00:58:07,024
Nothing else we can do, then.
Thank you, Walter.

718
00:58:08,234 --> 00:58:10,986
Is everything OK?

719
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:17,576
Walter says there's talk Carter may
boycott the Moscow Games next summer.

720
00:58:20,371 --> 00:58:23,040
So ifwe don't go there,
they might not come here?

721
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:26,919
Right.

722
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:33,509
Don't do this to yourself, Herb.

723
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:36,595
There are things you can control
and things you can't.

724
00:58:37,263 --> 00:58:39,681
- No milk.
- Herb.

725
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:41,934
Yeah, I heard you, honey.

726
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:54,488
- You have everything you want here.
- Don't tell me what I'll have.

727
00:58:54,572 --> 00:58:57,658
You don't know this enough
to tell me that.

728
00:58:59,994 --> 00:59:02,871
You know, I understand
you being upset with me

729
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:05,916
when I say you work too hard
teaching a simple game.

730
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,919
But don't ever criticize me
for caring about you.

731
00:59:16,302 --> 00:59:20,055
That's it. Come on, boys. Push it.
Push it. Go now. Move!

732
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:23,016
Damn it.

733
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:25,102
Come on, Rizzo.

734
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:28,480
- I know, coach. I know.
-You know?

735
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:32,025
If you knew,
then why did you do it again?

736
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:38,073
You better start putting the puck in
the net, or you're not going anywhere.

737
00:59:38,157 --> 00:59:40,200
And don't think I won't do it.

738
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:42,828
Johnson, line up. Let's go.

739
00:59:45,331 --> 00:59:47,624
Come on, shoot it.
Come on, shoot it.

740
00:59:47,709 --> 00:59:50,002
Up and around. Keep it moving.

741
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:54,006
Center, center, center!

742
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:57,884
Now move it up. And drop it back.

743
00:59:58,011 --> 01:00:00,470
Go to the net, Timmy. Go to the net!

744
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:04,308
Yeah.

745
01:00:04,726 --> 01:00:06,602
Nice play, boys, nice play.

746
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:09,646
Goal scored by number 18,
Tim Harrer.

747
01:00:10,189 --> 01:00:12,190
Change them up, boys. Let's go.

748
01:00:17,071 --> 01:00:19,072
Come on, boys.

749
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:27,080
Timmy. You keep driving the net.
That's all I care about.

750
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:31,376
That puck goes across the blue line,
you drive to the net. All that matters.

751
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:04,660
Herb, some of the boys
want to have a word.

752
01:01:05,953 --> 01:01:09,956
- What about?
- I think you ought to hear them out.

753
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:23,845
This had better take about two minutes.

754
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:31,269
This is crazy, Herb,
bringing him in this late.

755
01:01:31,896 --> 01:01:35,732
We got parents buying tickets,
getting rooms. What should we tell 'em?

756
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:37,651
With one of us going home as it is?

757
01:01:37,735 --> 01:01:40,654
I guess I don't have to ask
where you stand, Rizzo?

758
01:01:40,738 --> 01:01:42,989
This wasn't Rizzo's idea.

759
01:01:43,074 --> 01:01:45,951
You want me to say
I'm scared of getting cut?

760
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:48,453
I'm scared of getting cut.
Everybody is.

761
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:50,080
We just want it to be fair.

762
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:53,291
- He was right there in Colorado.
- That was six months ago.

763
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:56,795
- You don't think he's been playing?
- Not with us, he hasn't.

764
01:01:56,838 --> 01:01:58,672
- There's a difference.
- Like hell.

765
01:01:58,756 --> 01:02:02,342
- All I know is that kid can play.
- What, and we can't?

766
01:02:02,427 --> 01:02:05,262
He moves the puck,
he's got great vision on the ice...

767
01:02:05,346 --> 01:02:06,930
That's not the point.

768
01:02:06,973 --> 01:02:09,141
I'll tell you something else he's got.

769
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:11,727
He's got the attitude I want
on and off the ice,

770
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:15,272
so somebody better explain
why I shouldn't be giving him a look.

771
01:02:15,314 --> 01:02:17,274
Because we're a family.

772
01:02:18,609 --> 01:02:20,485
What?

773
01:02:20,528 --> 01:02:22,612
We're a family.

774
01:02:23,906 --> 01:02:25,449
A family?

775
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:29,327
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

776
01:02:35,001 --> 01:02:37,961
This is the family
you want to go to Lake Placid with?

777
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:41,089
- Definitely.
- Yeah, without a doubt.

778
01:02:41,174 --> 01:02:43,800
Wouldn't have it any other way.

779
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:50,015
Timmy Harrer can help us, boys.
Then I'm gonna send him home.

780
01:02:52,351 --> 01:02:55,270
We got one more to get down to 20.
You understand.

781
01:02:55,354 --> 01:02:56,688
Yep.

782
01:03:00,485 --> 01:03:04,196
- Looks like you got yourself a team.
- Almost.

783
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:10,702
- Let's talk about it.
- The rules.

784
01:03:10,828 --> 01:03:15,791
Your girl left these at my place.
With some milk and cookies.

785
01:03:20,379 --> 01:03:24,299
- Give her a hug for me.
- You guys are unbelievable.

786
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:27,844
- Real funny, guys.
- Hey, boys.

787
01:03:27,887 --> 01:03:30,096
We still got
two more presents to open up.

788
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:36,019
- Pardon me, coach.
- Yeah?

789
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:40,440
- Coach Patrick, from the boys.
- I thought you forgot.

790
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:44,110
To Craig.

791
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:49,032
That's beautiful, boys.

792
01:03:52,036 --> 01:03:55,372
- You're gonna like this one.
- What?

793
01:03:57,708 --> 01:03:59,334
- Perfect.
- Again.

794
01:04:00,753 --> 01:04:03,463
Again. Again.

795
01:04:03,548 --> 01:04:07,717
That's enough of that.
It's going back in the box.

796
01:04:08,427 --> 01:04:11,930
And Herb.
Merry Christmas from the boys.

797
01:04:11,973 --> 01:04:14,391
Drumroll, please.

798
01:04:17,228 --> 01:04:20,689
- Coach.
- Oh, yes.

799
01:04:20,773 --> 01:04:23,233
The gift that keeps on giving.

800
01:04:25,736 --> 01:04:28,864
- Speech.
- Ayatollah.

801
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:32,993
This may come as a shock
to some of you,

802
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:35,954
but I'm not very good
at giving sentimental speeches.

803
01:04:36,038 --> 01:04:38,623
You're kidding.

804
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:40,750
I don't think I should start tonight.

805
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:48,049
- Thanks for having me over, Velta.
- Good night, Herb.

806
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:50,635
- Doc, Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

807
01:04:55,099 --> 01:04:57,559
You guys have a great holiday.

808
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:04,107
Merry Christmas, coach.

809
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:09,154
Play some football.

810
01:05:16,662 --> 01:05:20,081
...the most important speech
of President Carter's term.

811
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:25,128
A look back now as 830 WCCO's
year-end special continues.

812
01:05:25,171 --> 01:05:28,131
The erosion of our confidence
in the future

813
01:05:28,215 --> 01:05:33,929
is threatening to destroy the social
and the political fabric of America.

814
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:38,725
The confidence
that we have always had as a people

815
01:05:38,809 --> 01:05:44,689
is not simply some romantic dream
or a proverb in a dusty book

816
01:05:44,815 --> 01:05:48,026
that we read just on the Fourth of July.

817
01:05:48,069 --> 01:05:50,236
It is the idea which founded our nation

818
01:05:50,363 --> 01:05:53,239
and has guided our development
as a people.

819
01:05:53,324 --> 01:05:57,452
Confidence in the future
has supported everything else.

820
01:05:57,536 --> 01:06:01,122
We've always believed
in something called progress.

821
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:05,001
We've always had a faith
that the days of our children

822
01:06:05,711 --> 01:06:07,963
would be better than our own.

823
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:12,384
Our people are losing that faith.

824
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:18,682
For the first time in our history,
a majority of our people believe

825
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:24,562
that the next five years
will be worse than the past five years.

826
01:06:26,565 --> 01:06:31,444
We were taught
that our armies were always invincible

827
01:06:31,529 --> 01:06:34,823
and our causes were alwaysjust,

828
01:06:34,907 --> 01:06:38,118
only to suffer the agony of Vietnam.

829
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:43,248
We respected the presidency

830
01:06:43,332 --> 01:06:47,752
as a place of honor
until the shock of Watergate.

831
01:06:49,630 --> 01:06:54,342
We've got to stop crying
and start sweating.

832
01:06:56,387 --> 01:06:59,639
Stop talking and start walking.

833
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:04,602
Working together with our common faith,

834
01:07:06,105 --> 01:07:08,857
we cannot fail.

835
01:07:41,974 --> 01:07:43,099
Yeah.

836
01:07:43,142 --> 01:07:44,559
Hard workout.

837
01:07:44,643 --> 01:07:48,730
- You guys wanna grab something to eat?
- Yeah. Where you guys gonna go?

838
01:07:48,814 --> 01:07:51,649
- Maybe that Mario's place.
- Mario's?

839
01:07:58,991 --> 01:08:01,076
Hey, coach.

840
01:08:04,663 --> 01:08:07,332
Coxy, Herb wants to see you.

841
01:08:47,873 --> 01:08:49,374
Come in.

842
01:08:54,088 --> 01:08:56,464
Coach Patrick said you wanted to see me.

843
01:08:57,758 --> 01:09:00,552
Why don't you have a seat there, Ralph?

844
01:09:12,064 --> 01:09:15,108
There's just no easy way of doing this.

845
01:09:17,069 --> 01:09:21,489
The rules say that we gotta be down
to 20 men and right now we're at 21 .

846
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:29,581
I wish like hell
I could keep you, Ralph. I do.

847
01:09:29,665 --> 01:09:31,666
Yeah.

848
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:34,752
Yeah, I know.

849
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:40,091
You're a hell of a hockey player.

850
01:09:40,217 --> 01:09:42,218
This doesn't change that.

851
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:45,597
Thanks.

852
01:09:54,106 --> 01:09:56,524
Thanks for giving me a shot, coach.

853
01:09:57,109 --> 01:10:00,069
Thanks for giving me your very best.

854
01:10:30,601 --> 01:10:33,519
- Yeah?
- Herb. Walter.

855
01:10:33,604 --> 01:10:37,982
Well, you've got your wish. Brezhnev's
telling Carter to screw himself.

856
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:40,693
Yeah, Walter, how's that?

857
01:10:40,778 --> 01:10:43,029
The Kremlin released a statement today

858
01:10:43,113 --> 01:10:45,782
saying they're gonna prove
how good they are

859
01:10:45,908 --> 01:10:48,493
by beating us over here on our own ice.

860
01:10:48,577 --> 01:10:50,578
They're all gonna play.

861
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:53,873
The Soviets, the Czechs,
the whole bunch ofthem.

862
01:10:53,958 --> 01:10:57,126
Have you got your roster finalized yet?

863
01:10:58,170 --> 01:11:00,171
Yeah, I got my team.

864
01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:04,968
I still don't know why you scheduled
this, but get your guys to New York.

865
01:11:05,010 --> 01:11:06,928
They've got a game to play.

866
01:11:40,546 --> 01:11:46,050
Ladies and gentlemen,
your 1980 US Olympic team.

867
01:11:47,803 --> 01:11:49,887
As we await the opening face-off

868
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:52,223
in this game between the Soviet Union

869
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:54,809
and Team USA
here at Madison Square Garden,

870
01:11:54,893 --> 01:11:57,437
the teams line up
on their respective blue lines.

871
01:11:57,563 --> 01:12:02,108
And Soviet Union team captain Boris
Mikhailov skating over to his bench

872
01:12:02,192 --> 01:12:04,902
to pick up that NHL Challenge trophy.

873
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:08,906
The trophy that his team won here
at Madison Square Garden last October,

874
01:12:09,033 --> 01:12:12,869
and won in decisive fashion,
beating the NHL All-Stars.

875
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:17,832
Getting a mixed reaction
from the capacity audience here.

876
01:12:17,916 --> 01:12:21,044
Some cheers, but a few boos
going through the crowd as well.

877
01:12:23,922 --> 01:12:28,509
The two teams clear the ice
and repair to their respective goals

878
01:12:28,594 --> 01:12:30,678
as we get set for the opening face-off

879
01:12:30,763 --> 01:12:33,431
in this final tune-up
for these two teams

880
01:12:33,515 --> 01:12:37,518
before the Olympic Games
in Lake Placid.

881
01:12:45,694 --> 01:12:48,029
- One, two, three.
- USA!

882
01:12:56,872 --> 01:12:59,957
And as we get set
to drop the puck for this contest,

883
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:05,630
the Soviets starting their big line of
Mikhailov between Kharlamov and Petrov.

884
01:13:05,714 --> 01:13:08,508
Team USA countering
with Mark Johnson at center

885
01:13:08,592 --> 01:13:12,220
between McClanahan and Dave Silk.

886
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:17,975
And we're ready to go
with this warm-up contest.

887
01:13:24,149 --> 01:13:25,441
From the heart, boys.

888
01:13:27,903 --> 01:13:33,241
It's the Soviet Union in control,
making a charge into the Team USA zone.

889
01:13:33,325 --> 01:13:37,745
A shot from the point goes off the post
and in behind the Team USA net.

890
01:13:37,830 --> 01:13:39,705
Puck comes back to the blue line.

891
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:43,709
Moving in with a shot, stopped
by Craig, and it goes into the corner.

892
01:13:43,794 --> 01:13:46,504
Finally, Team USA
gets a stick on the puck

893
01:13:46,588 --> 01:13:49,507
as Ramsey brings it up
to the blue line.

894
01:13:50,134 --> 01:13:52,927
He's absolutely flattened there
by Kasatonov.

895
01:13:53,011 --> 01:13:54,387
Two on one. Two on one!

896
01:13:54,471 --> 01:13:56,764
Soviet Union turning it
into a two on one.

897
01:13:56,849 --> 01:13:59,392
- Back door, OC. Look out.
- Get the puck.

898
01:14:00,853 --> 01:14:03,020
Moving in. Shoots and scores.

899
01:14:05,023 --> 01:14:06,607
Come on. Come on!

900
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:12,530
Break it up. Break it up.

901
01:14:12,614 --> 01:14:14,449
That's it, let's go.

902
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:18,035
Nice expression on your face,
you dummy.

903
01:14:22,833 --> 01:14:26,711
Jack, you gotta listen to me.
You gotta listen to me!

904
01:14:27,129 --> 01:14:30,590
The Soviets breaking out
of their own zone, up the ice to center.

905
01:14:30,674 --> 01:14:32,592
Krutov goes in over the US blue line.

906
01:14:32,718 --> 01:14:36,554
Shoots and scores.
He shoots and scores.

907
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:39,015
Shoots. He scores.

908
01:14:39,057 --> 01:14:44,896
The Soviet Union
routing Team USA ten to three.

909
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:48,983
There's always things you can work on.
This club's no exception.

910
01:14:49,067 --> 01:14:51,194
I think we're gonna be all right.

911
01:14:51,236 --> 01:14:53,654
The Soviets have been together
ten years.

912
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:56,365
We got college kids
getting to know each other.

913
01:14:56,408 --> 01:14:58,993
They could have won
this thing 30 to nothing.

914
01:14:59,077 --> 01:15:01,204
Herb, can we talk
about tonight's game?

915
01:15:01,246 --> 01:15:02,914
Sorry. How is he?

916
01:15:02,956 --> 01:15:04,999
I'm not sure if he needs surgery.

917
01:15:05,083 --> 01:15:07,919
I'm hoping it's a ligament pull,
but it could be a tear.

918
01:15:07,961 --> 01:15:10,505
Herb, we got three days until Sweden.

919
01:15:10,589 --> 01:15:13,049
Giving him a roster spot's
a waste of money.

920
01:15:13,091 --> 01:15:16,344
- Give me a best case.
- Miss three or four games minimum.

921
01:15:16,428 --> 01:15:18,054
The whole qualifying round.

922
01:15:18,096 --> 01:15:20,640
The kid's made the team,
busted his ass for me,

923
01:15:20,766 --> 01:15:24,310
and now I gotta send him home,
that the deal?

924
01:15:53,048 --> 01:15:55,967
- What did Doc say?
- He doesn't know yet.

925
01:15:56,051 --> 01:16:01,847
He's gonna go with you to the hospital
and get a picture of your knee taken.

926
01:16:04,351 --> 01:16:06,310
Then we'll see.

927
01:16:52,524 --> 01:16:55,860
- Thinking about sitting you down, Jim.
- What?

928
01:16:55,944 --> 01:16:59,947
- What are you talking about?
- I played you too much, you're tired.

929
01:17:00,032 --> 01:17:03,159
It's time I gave Janny a look.
He's waited seven months.

930
01:17:03,201 --> 01:17:06,370
- You're kidding me. Now?
- Yeah, of course I mean now.

931
01:17:06,496 --> 01:17:09,290
- That's my net.
- They just scored ten goals.

932
01:17:09,374 --> 01:17:12,043
Right now it's everybody's net.

933
01:17:14,171 --> 01:17:18,090
Wait a second.
I've given you everything I've got.

934
01:17:18,216 --> 01:17:21,218
Have you? Given me your very best?

935
01:17:21,261 --> 01:17:23,220
I know there's a lot more in you.

936
01:17:23,305 --> 01:17:27,099
A whole other level
that you just don't want to go to.

937
01:17:27,726 --> 01:17:30,019
What the hell?
You don't even understand.

938
01:17:30,062 --> 01:17:34,231
I'll tell you what I don't understand.
I don't understand you.

939
01:17:34,274 --> 01:17:38,444
Nobody on this team understands you
and your sayings and your drills

940
01:17:38,570 --> 01:17:42,490
and those stupid psychology tests
you had everybody take.

941
01:17:42,574 --> 01:17:44,575
Everybody?

942
01:17:45,827 --> 01:17:50,164
So that's what this is about?
Because I didn't take your test?

943
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:54,001
Fine. I'll take your test.
Is that what you want?

944
01:17:54,086 --> 01:17:59,131
No. I want to see that kid in the net
who wouldn't take the test.

945
01:18:06,056 --> 01:18:08,557
You gotta be kidding me.
What did he do?

946
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:13,562
He did something amazing.
He started to laugh.

947
01:18:13,605 --> 01:18:17,483
Then everybody in the audience
started to laugh.

948
01:18:17,609 --> 01:18:21,070
It sounds funny,
but I was so proud of him.

949
01:18:21,154 --> 01:18:24,031
I'm starting to think
that our son takes after you.

950
01:18:24,116 --> 01:18:26,617
That's all part of my plan.

951
01:18:26,702 --> 01:18:29,787
Well, you're a very smart woman.

952
01:18:31,873 --> 01:18:33,374
I miss you.

953
01:18:33,458 --> 01:18:35,918
The Games are only a couple
of days away now.

954
01:18:37,003 --> 01:18:41,132
- You got your airplane tickets?
- Yeah. Walter had them sent over.

955
01:18:42,634 --> 01:18:44,135
I guess I'll see you then.

956
01:18:44,219 --> 01:18:46,887
You sound tired.
Try and get some sleep.

957
01:18:46,972 --> 01:18:50,391
- Yeah, I will.
- All right. I'll talk to you later.

958
01:18:50,475 --> 01:18:52,435
- Hey, Patti?
- Yeah?

959
01:18:54,104 --> 01:18:56,105
I miss you too.

960
01:18:57,149 --> 01:19:00,526
- Good night.
- Good night.

961
01:19:38,190 --> 01:19:42,151
I'll check on OC.
Take care of these guys here.

962
01:19:42,194 --> 01:19:44,028
Come on, guys. Stick with me.

963
01:19:46,948 --> 01:19:48,949
This is your room key.

964
01:19:49,034 --> 01:19:53,412
And this is your ID badge that
you'll need forjust about everything.

965
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:55,456
Don't lose it.

966
01:19:57,501 --> 01:19:59,126
Herb, Herb.

967
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:05,508
Herb, it'll be fine.
I can fight through it.

968
01:20:06,968 --> 01:20:09,303
Why don't you join the boys
over there, OC?

969
01:20:10,555 --> 01:20:12,848
It's good to see you, kid.

970
01:20:14,518 --> 01:20:16,352
Attaboy.

971
01:20:17,604 --> 01:20:20,189
- Well?
- The good news is it's not a tear.

972
01:20:20,232 --> 01:20:22,399
It's a stretched ligament. No surgery.

973
01:20:22,484 --> 01:20:25,903
But there is no way
he can play before the medal round.

974
01:20:25,987 --> 01:20:27,196
Forget the medal round.

975
01:20:27,239 --> 01:20:30,950
You keep O'Callahan
and you lose one more skater,

976
01:20:31,076 --> 01:20:34,453
you're gonna have a tough time
putting a decent team on the ice.

977
01:20:34,538 --> 01:20:36,580
It's that simple.

978
01:20:40,085 --> 01:20:42,920
I asked Herb.
He's keeping me in the dark.

979
01:20:43,004 --> 01:20:45,130
Oh, boy.

980
01:20:45,715 --> 01:20:49,927
- If he gets shaky, it's you.
- Stay loose, Janny.

981
01:20:50,929 --> 01:20:53,931
You're in there tomorrow, Jimmy.
Let's bring it up now.

982
01:20:53,974 --> 01:20:57,726
- OK. Thanks a lot.
- Attaboy, Jimmy. Go get them.

983
01:21:02,607 --> 01:21:05,943
- I'll see you on the bus.
- All right.

984
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:30,426
Doc said no, right?

985
01:21:33,013 --> 01:21:36,974
He said you might be able to go
in a week. Maybe two.

986
01:21:38,476 --> 01:21:42,354
- What if it's two?
- That puts me in a tight spot.

987
01:21:43,648 --> 01:21:48,235
I got 20 guys to think about and they're
all looking at me to do what's best.

988
01:21:48,987 --> 01:21:53,657
- I understand, coach.
- Which is why I'm hanging on to you.

989
01:21:58,914 --> 01:22:01,665
I swear to God,
if you're not being serious...

990
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:05,920
I'm only saying this if you promise you
won't ask me to play until I tell you...

991
01:22:06,004 --> 01:22:09,048
I won't. I mean, I will.
I promise you, coach.

992
01:22:09,132 --> 01:22:13,385
'Cause if you do, I'll stick your ass
on an airplane and back to Boston.

993
01:22:17,515 --> 01:22:21,977
- All right, Doc's waiting for you.
- Thank you, Herb.

994
01:22:34,074 --> 01:22:36,200
OC is playing, baby.

995
01:23:12,028 --> 01:23:13,737
Move your feet, boys. Move your feet!

996
01:23:13,780 --> 01:23:15,322
Ramsey passes to Eruzione.

997
01:23:15,407 --> 01:23:18,951
Eruzione carrying the puck up
the boards. Drops the pass for Broten.

998
01:23:19,077 --> 01:23:21,328
He shoots. Kicked away by Lindbergh.

999
01:23:21,413 --> 01:23:23,414
Boys, hit that one-timer now. Come on!

1000
01:23:23,498 --> 01:23:26,875
Al Michaels with Ken Dryden.
With 4:10 to go in the first period,

1001
01:23:26,918 --> 01:23:30,337
it's Sweden leading
the United States one to nothing.

1002
01:23:31,339 --> 01:23:35,509
Åhlberg to Eriksson.
And a big hit by Dave Christian.

1003
01:23:35,593 --> 01:23:39,430
Eriksson picks up the puck, passes
to Lundqvist, Lundqvist to Åhlberg.

1004
01:23:39,514 --> 01:23:43,559
- Mac, where is it?
- Up this way. That's it.

1005
01:23:43,601 --> 01:23:46,812
Åhlberg shoots. Save by Craig.

1006
01:23:47,939 --> 01:23:49,481
Eruzione fighting for it.

1007
01:23:49,566 --> 01:23:52,943
Mike Eruzione named team captain
by coach Herb Brooks

1008
01:23:53,069 --> 01:23:57,031
for, as Herb put it, his leadership
qualities on and off the ice.

1009
01:23:57,115 --> 01:23:58,741
I'm taking him out.

1010
01:23:58,783 --> 01:24:01,785
The US team
is playing tentative hockey tonight, Al.

1011
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:05,789
Tough draw having to face Sweden,
third-best team in the world.

1012
01:24:06,499 --> 01:24:10,711
- You know what I mean?
- I got you. I think it's worth a try.

1013
01:24:10,795 --> 01:24:13,422
- What's the deal with Mac?
- Upper-leg contusion.

1014
01:24:13,465 --> 01:24:16,884
- He's done for the night.
- What if he plays?

1015
01:24:16,968 --> 01:24:21,597
- I don't understand.
- If he plays, can he hurt it any worse?

1016
01:24:21,639 --> 01:24:26,310
No, but it will be very painful for him
and he won't be able to do very much.

1017
01:24:34,486 --> 01:24:36,820
This is unbelievable.

1018
01:24:36,905 --> 01:24:41,950
You guys are playing like this is
some throwaway game up in Rochester.

1019
01:24:41,993 --> 01:24:44,078
- Who we playing, Rammer?
- Sweden.

1020
01:24:44,162 --> 01:24:48,707
Yeah, you're damn right. Sweden.
In the Olympics.

1021
01:24:54,130 --> 01:24:58,675
What the hell's wrong with you?
Put your gear on.

1022
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:00,427
I said put your gear on.

1023
01:25:00,512 --> 01:25:04,223
- Doc told me I can't play.
- I know. You got a bad bruise.

1024
01:25:05,350 --> 01:25:09,061
You know what? Put your street clothes
on. I got no time for quitters.

1025
01:25:09,145 --> 01:25:12,147
Come on, Herb. Nobody's quitting here.

1026
01:25:12,190 --> 01:25:15,484
You worry about your own game.
Plenty there to keep you busy.

1027
01:25:18,279 --> 01:25:22,157
A bruise on the leg is a hell of a long
way from the heart, you candy-ass.

1028
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:24,618
- What did you call me?
- You heard me.

1029
01:25:26,704 --> 01:25:28,622
You want me to play?

1030
01:25:28,706 --> 01:25:31,625
- I want you to be a hockey player!
- I am a hockey player!

1031
01:25:31,709 --> 01:25:34,962
You want me to play on one leg?
I'll play on one leg!

1032
01:25:35,046 --> 01:25:37,422
- That'll get them going.
- Oh, yeah.

1033
01:25:37,507 --> 01:25:39,758
- Will that make you happy?
- I'll clean up.

1034
01:25:39,884 --> 01:25:41,718
I am a hockey player!

1035
01:25:41,803 --> 01:25:46,056
2:49 remaining in the game.
Sweden leading two-one.

1036
01:25:46,141 --> 01:25:50,144
The US team has fought hard, but they've
still got nothing to show for it.

1037
01:25:50,228 --> 01:25:52,855
Ifthey don't beat or tie the Swedes,

1038
01:25:52,939 --> 01:25:56,316
it'll be very difficult
to advance to the medal round.

1039
01:25:57,026 --> 01:26:00,696
McClanahan after the loose puck.
He's hit hard by Söderström.

1040
01:26:00,738 --> 01:26:02,531
- Go, go, go, Mac.
- Come on, Mac.

1041
01:26:02,574 --> 01:26:07,119
McClanahan gutting it out despite
being injured in the first period.

1042
01:26:07,203 --> 01:26:10,289
Silk to Johnson. Back to Silk.
Through the neutral zone.

1043
01:26:10,373 --> 01:26:12,040
Attaboy, Mac. Keep going.

1044
01:26:13,042 --> 01:26:17,754
Dumped into the Swedish zone
and stopped behind the net by Lindbergh.

1045
01:26:17,881 --> 01:26:21,633
Johnson fighting Eriksson for it now.
It comes out to Waltin.

1046
01:26:21,718 --> 01:26:24,344
He's hit hard by McClanahan.

1047
01:26:24,429 --> 01:26:28,056
- All right, Mac.
- Baker, you're up next. The right side.

1048
01:26:28,141 --> 01:26:32,603
The Swedes regain control behind their
own net, 1 :40 remaining in the game.

1049
01:26:32,729 --> 01:26:34,771
Coneheads, you're up next.

1050
01:26:34,856 --> 01:26:38,859
Mats Waltin...
moving it out to Jan Eriksson.

1051
01:26:38,943 --> 01:26:42,029
Jan Eriksson out to Håkan Eriksson.

1052
01:26:42,113 --> 01:26:44,406
- Across the US blue line.
- Take it back.

1053
01:26:44,449 --> 01:26:47,951
Into the corner. He circles.

1054
01:26:48,077 --> 01:26:52,372
Passes across to Åhlberg. Wrist shot.
Knocked out ofthe air by Craig.

1055
01:26:54,959 --> 01:26:58,003
Puck picked up by Suter,
moved ahead to Johnson.

1056
01:26:58,087 --> 01:26:59,463
Switch them up. Go, go, go!

1057
01:26:59,547 --> 01:27:04,384
Johnson heads to the bench
with just over a minute and a half left.

1058
01:27:04,469 --> 01:27:08,555
Precious seconds ticking away
for this US team.

1059
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:11,099
- What are you doing with Baker there?
- 1 :20.

1060
01:27:11,142 --> 01:27:16,021
Herb Brooks has molded this unit.
Seven months oftraining, 61 games.

1061
01:27:16,105 --> 01:27:20,984
Just a little over a minute left
to avoid a very damaging loss.

1062
01:27:21,069 --> 01:27:23,528
Åhlberg up the wing to Håkan Eriksson.

1063
01:27:23,613 --> 01:27:26,657
Stopped by Craig.
Rebound picked up by Schneider.

1064
01:27:28,159 --> 01:27:32,663
Schneider flying up the wing,
over the blue line and into the corner.

1065
01:27:32,747 --> 01:27:35,582
- Jimmy, come on.
- Brooks is pulling goalie Jim Craig

1066
01:27:35,667 --> 01:27:37,501
for an extra skater to try to tie it.

1067
01:27:37,585 --> 01:27:40,212
- They have no choice, Al.
- 45 seconds left.

1068
01:27:40,338 --> 01:27:43,006
Sweden leading the US team two to one.

1069
01:27:43,091 --> 01:27:45,634
Across to Silk. He moves in.

1070
01:27:45,718 --> 01:27:50,013
His backhander is stopped by Lindbergh.
Thirty-nine seconds remaining.

1071
01:27:52,183 --> 01:27:56,186
Schneider to Ramsey, across to Baker.
He wraps it around the boards.

1072
01:27:58,189 --> 01:28:02,192
Harrington fighting for the puck
with Näslund. Back to Ramsey.

1073
01:28:02,235 --> 01:28:05,070
To Johnson in front.
Broken up by Holmgren.

1074
01:28:05,321 --> 01:28:08,448
Kept in by Baker
and fired behind the net.

1075
01:28:08,533 --> 01:28:11,243
Loose puck.
Schneider and Waltin fighting for it.

1076
01:28:11,327 --> 01:28:13,870
Schneider holds him off.

1077
01:28:13,913 --> 01:28:16,206
Kicks it loose. Pavelich has it.

1078
01:28:16,249 --> 01:28:20,544
He makes a move around
Håkan Eriksson, passes across to Baker.

1079
01:28:20,628 --> 01:28:24,798
He scores!
The United States has tied it.

1080
01:28:24,882 --> 01:28:27,426
Bill Baker scores in the final minute.

1081
01:28:27,510 --> 01:28:31,221
And the US team is still very much alive
in the opening round.

1082
01:28:31,306 --> 01:28:35,309
It was a hell of a move.
I didn't see him out there.

1083
01:28:39,731 --> 01:28:44,609
I'm Jim McKay, and we're back again
live in Lake Placid, New York.

1084
01:28:44,736 --> 01:28:48,572
What an amazing start
for these 13th Olympic Winter Games.

1085
01:28:48,656 --> 01:28:53,243
After a remarkable last-minute tie
against Sweden two nights ago,

1086
01:28:53,328 --> 01:28:55,912
the US hockey team, huge underdogs,

1087
01:28:55,997 --> 01:29:00,000
pulled off a tremendous upset
last night, defeating Czechoslovakia,

1088
01:29:00,084 --> 01:29:04,671
considered the second-best team
behind the Soviet Union.

1089
01:29:04,756 --> 01:29:07,090
The final score, seven to three.

1090
01:29:08,009 --> 01:29:10,427
Why so many reporters?
Are you serious?

1091
01:29:10,511 --> 01:29:12,846
We won two games.
We got a way to go here.

1092
01:29:12,930 --> 01:29:15,349
Think ofwhat they've
had to write about.

1093
01:29:15,433 --> 01:29:19,686
Hostages, Afghanistan.
Transportation chaos.

1094
01:29:19,771 --> 01:29:23,148
Patti probably
has talked to you about that.

1095
01:29:23,232 --> 01:29:27,778
Listen, Herb,
the bottom line is that your young guys

1096
01:29:27,862 --> 01:29:30,947
just kicked the crap out
of Czechoslovakia,

1097
01:29:31,074 --> 01:29:34,659
and this is something
that this country is ready for.

1098
01:29:34,744 --> 01:29:38,038
Now, you want to see reporters?
Win a couple more games.

1099
01:29:38,122 --> 01:29:41,625
They are just kids, so let's not turn
this into something more.

1100
01:29:41,793 --> 01:29:43,960
I'm not sure we got any control over it.

1101
01:29:46,381 --> 01:29:48,131
Viktor.

1102
01:29:52,970 --> 01:29:55,889
Somebody's gonna beat those guys.

1103
01:29:57,558 --> 01:30:00,143
Buzz Schneider flying up the right wing.

1104
01:30:00,228 --> 01:30:03,688
Takes a long pass from Ramsey.
He's all alone on the breakaway.

1105
01:30:03,815 --> 01:30:05,399
He shoots. He scores.

1106
01:30:05,483 --> 01:30:11,279
Buzz Schneider on a breakaway puts the
US up five to one in the third period.

1107
01:30:17,703 --> 01:30:23,083
Now that Norway is behind you,
what do you look for out of Romania?

1108
01:30:23,167 --> 01:30:26,294
It should be a tough test.
We're not gonna overlook them.

1109
01:30:29,590 --> 01:30:32,175
- Mike.
- Jimmy Craig's been great.

1110
01:30:32,260 --> 01:30:34,594
Is there any chance
we could talk to him?

1111
01:30:34,679 --> 01:30:36,930
As I said the other night, Mike,

1112
01:30:37,014 --> 01:30:39,724
this isn't an individual effort
going on here.

1113
01:30:39,809 --> 01:30:43,603
It's about a team. We're a team
on the ice, and we're one off it.

1114
01:30:46,065 --> 01:30:49,526
Halauca breaking up the left side,
chased by Christian.

1115
01:30:50,570 --> 01:30:54,698
Behind the US net.
Drops a pass for Antal. Antal slams it.

1116
01:30:54,782 --> 01:30:57,659
Shot. Glove save by Jim Craig.

1117
01:30:57,702 --> 01:31:00,662
The US up seven to two here
late in the third.

1118
01:31:00,705 --> 01:31:04,541
Making it to the medal round
was always our goal from day one,

1119
01:31:04,667 --> 01:31:07,961
so we feel real good
about what we've accomplished so far.

1120
01:31:08,045 --> 01:31:09,546
- Herb!
- Herb!

1121
01:31:13,759 --> 01:31:16,887
Still no chance
we can talk with any of your players?

1122
01:31:16,929 --> 01:31:18,180
Still no chance.

1123
01:31:18,222 --> 01:31:21,057
How do you respond
to those who feel you do this

1124
01:31:21,142 --> 01:31:23,351
to keep the spotlight on yourself?

1125
01:31:28,774 --> 01:31:34,029
Loose puck. Kiessling
across to Kretschmer. Up to Philipp.

1126
01:31:34,280 --> 01:31:37,741
He's run hard into the boards
by Strobel. Huge hit.

1127
01:31:38,743 --> 01:31:41,161
Ramsey has it, moves it up to Verchota.

1128
01:31:41,621 --> 01:31:44,956
Verchota across the blue line. Winds up.

1129
01:31:45,041 --> 01:31:47,042
He scores!

1130
01:31:48,085 --> 01:31:52,088
Phil Verchota puts it past Sutner
to put the US up four to two

1131
01:31:52,131 --> 01:31:56,009
with 15:43 remaining to play
here in the third period.

1132
01:31:56,093 --> 01:31:59,012
We'll be staying with this one
right to the end.

1133
01:31:59,096 --> 01:32:02,516
The pairings for the medal round
are as follows.

1134
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:06,269
The United States will play
the Soviet Union first tomorrow.

1135
01:32:06,354 --> 01:32:09,272
Sweden and Finland in the second game.

1136
01:32:09,357 --> 01:32:14,569
The face-off for the US-Soviet game
is 1700 hours.

1137
01:32:14,612 --> 01:32:20,367
Now, if you have any questions, we have
the US assistant coach, Craig Patrick.

1138
01:32:21,536 --> 01:32:23,703
- Patrick!
- Coach Patrick!

1139
01:32:23,788 --> 01:32:25,580
Coach Patrick! Coach Patrick!

1140
01:32:25,623 --> 01:32:28,792
Where's Herb Brooks?
How come he's not here today?

1141
01:32:28,876 --> 01:32:32,546
Herb is out preparing
for tomorrow's game.

1142
01:32:33,756 --> 01:32:36,216
Yeah. Yeah.

1143
01:32:49,397 --> 01:32:51,064
Hi, Daddy.

1144
01:33:04,495 --> 01:33:06,121
There we go.

1145
01:33:07,748 --> 01:33:11,793
- There was no whipped cream.
- That's all right.

1146
01:33:20,011 --> 01:33:22,012
- What?
- What?

1147
01:33:27,685 --> 01:33:32,939
I got a telegram from a lady in Texas
today. You know what it said?

1148
01:33:33,941 --> 01:33:35,984
"Beat those commie bastards."

1149
01:33:38,029 --> 01:33:41,656
We're playing a hockey game
against the greatest team in the world,

1150
01:33:41,699 --> 01:33:45,368
maybe the best that's ever played.
Why can't we just leave it at that?

1151
01:33:45,411 --> 01:33:48,038
This is more than a hockey game
to a lot of people.

1152
01:33:48,122 --> 01:33:50,123
I keep running through them all.

1153
01:33:50,207 --> 01:33:55,503
Johnson on Mikhailov. Broten on Petrov.
Pav against whoever-ov.

1154
01:33:55,546 --> 01:33:59,424
We just... We don't match up, Patti.

1155
01:34:02,053 --> 01:34:05,972
You might want to skip that
when you talk to the boys tomorrow.

1156
01:34:15,775 --> 01:34:18,568
Herb. Herb.

1157
01:34:21,906 --> 01:34:25,075
There's no disgrace
in losing to this team.

1158
01:34:25,159 --> 01:34:26,409
I know.

1159
01:34:27,161 --> 01:34:31,498
The important thing is you got this far.

1160
01:34:34,377 --> 01:34:38,838
The important thing
is those 20 boys knowing in 20 years

1161
01:34:38,923 --> 01:34:42,717
they didn't leave anything on the table.

1162
01:34:42,802 --> 01:34:45,679
That they played their hearts out.

1163
01:34:47,473 --> 01:34:49,557
That's the important thing.

1164
01:35:32,727 --> 01:35:36,146
- Greatjob. Great day.
- Thanks. Sure is, sure is.

1165
01:35:36,230 --> 01:35:38,273
Any chance we can wish the boys luck?

1166
01:35:38,315 --> 01:35:42,235
I'm sorry, Bob. You know Herb.
Not a good time right now.

1167
01:35:42,319 --> 01:35:46,489
- After the game, all right?
- Craig, hold up.

1168
01:35:46,532 --> 01:35:49,826
Herb doesn't want any distractions.
It's understandable.

1169
01:35:49,910 --> 01:35:51,953
We just wanted to wish them luck.

1170
01:36:03,674 --> 01:36:05,216
You ready to go?

1171
01:36:07,178 --> 01:36:10,263
- You serious? Am I playing?
- Suit up.

1172
01:38:19,810 --> 01:38:21,895
Great moments...

1173
01:38:23,564 --> 01:38:26,482
...are born from great opportunity.

1174
01:38:28,652 --> 01:38:31,154
That's what you have here tonight, boys.

1175
01:38:33,490 --> 01:38:37,118
That's what you've earned here tonight.

1176
01:38:41,415 --> 01:38:42,790
One game.

1177
01:38:44,501 --> 01:38:48,504
Ifwe played them ten times,
they might win nine.

1178
01:38:50,382 --> 01:38:52,383
But not this game.

1179
01:38:53,802 --> 01:38:55,470
Not tonight.

1180
01:38:58,223 --> 01:39:01,309
Tonight we skate with them.

1181
01:39:02,770 --> 01:39:05,605
Tonight we stay with them.

1182
01:39:05,689 --> 01:39:09,359
And we shut them down because we can.

1183
01:39:15,324 --> 01:39:20,912
Tonight we are
the greatest hockey team in the world.

1184
01:39:27,628 --> 01:39:30,505
You were born to be hockey players.

1185
01:39:31,507 --> 01:39:33,508
Every one of you.

1186
01:39:36,261 --> 01:39:39,889
And you were meant to be here tonight.

1187
01:39:44,478 --> 01:39:46,646
This is your time.

1188
01:39:50,818 --> 01:39:53,945
Their time is done.

1189
01:39:54,029 --> 01:39:56,030
It's over.

1190
01:39:57,074 --> 01:40:03,079
I'm sick and tired of hearing about what
a great hockey team the Soviets have.

1191
01:40:03,163 --> 01:40:07,041
Screw them. This is your time.

1192
01:40:09,169 --> 01:40:11,963
Now, go out there and take it.

1193
01:41:27,790 --> 01:41:30,833
Hold up here a second.
We're just gonna wait for the OK.

1194
01:41:32,920 --> 01:41:36,005
- We're all set.
- All right. Go ahead and send them in.

1195
01:41:36,090 --> 01:41:38,299
OK. It's time.

1196
01:41:38,342 --> 01:41:40,009
Come on, Jimmy.

1197
01:41:40,094 --> 01:41:44,305
Come on, Buzzy. Let's hustle.

1198
01:41:47,976 --> 01:41:50,019
Come on, Brotz. Let's go, Strobel.

1199
01:41:52,689 --> 01:41:54,357
Rizzo.

1200
01:41:56,443 --> 01:42:00,613
USA! USA! USA!

1201
01:42:07,996 --> 01:42:12,291
The excitement building.
The Olympic Center filling to capacity.

1202
01:42:12,376 --> 01:42:17,296
The face value of a top ticket
for tonight's game, $67.20.

1203
01:42:17,381 --> 01:42:22,426
Outside they were exchanging hands
at three times the face value.

1204
01:42:22,511 --> 01:42:26,472
Hello again. I'm Al Michaels with
Ken Dryden. It should be a great night.

1205
01:42:26,557 --> 01:42:28,224
I'm sure there are a lot of people here

1206
01:42:28,308 --> 01:42:31,561
who do not know the difference
between a blue line and a clothesline.

1207
01:42:31,645 --> 01:42:33,396
It's irrelevant. It doesn't matter.

1208
01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:36,732
Because we have the rarest
of sporting events.

1209
01:42:36,817 --> 01:42:40,194
An event that needs no buildup,
no superfluous adjectives.

1210
01:42:40,279 --> 01:42:42,655
In a political or nationalistic sense,

1211
01:42:42,739 --> 01:42:45,199
it is being viewed
with varying perspectives.

1212
01:42:45,284 --> 01:42:47,535
But manifestly it is a hockey game.

1213
01:42:47,619 --> 01:42:51,706
The United States and the Soviet Union
on a sheet of ice in Lake Placid.

1214
01:42:51,790 --> 01:42:53,749
Ken, some of your thoughts.

1215
01:42:53,917 --> 01:42:56,252
For the US team, it's discovery time.

1216
01:42:56,336 --> 01:43:00,506
It's one thing to be young and promising
and it's quite another to be good.

1217
01:43:00,591 --> 01:43:03,634
In the next two and a half hours,
the US players will go through

1218
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:07,930
perhaps the most difficult and demanding
yet exhilarating time oftheir lives.

1219
01:43:08,015 --> 01:43:11,184
They will be playing
against the best team in the world,

1220
01:43:11,268 --> 01:43:13,436
a team that's far better than they are,

1221
01:43:13,478 --> 01:43:17,940
a team that's dominated world hockey
for the last 15 years.

1222
01:43:19,109 --> 01:43:21,944
In the crowd,
Jim Craig's father, Donald Craig.

1223
01:43:22,029 --> 01:43:26,115
It's been a difficult time for the
family with the passing of Jimmy's mom.

1224
01:43:26,241 --> 01:43:29,118
One of her dreams
was to have her son play on this team.

1225
01:43:29,203 --> 01:43:32,788
So this has to be an emotional night
for the two ofthem.

1226
01:43:38,045 --> 01:43:40,546
He doesn't look too nervous down there.

1227
01:43:40,631 --> 01:43:44,467
The US team, very young.
Average age, 21 years old.

1228
01:43:44,551 --> 01:43:46,552
The Soviets, much more seasoned.

1229
01:43:46,637 --> 01:43:50,556
Some ofthem have been playing
together for the last 15 years.

1230
01:43:51,016 --> 01:43:54,268
And this game is about to get under way.

1231
01:44:02,986 --> 01:44:05,863
All right. On three, boys.

1232
01:44:05,948 --> 01:44:08,491
- One, two, three.
- USA!

1233
01:44:10,160 --> 01:44:12,828
Jim Craig in goal for the United States.

1234
01:44:12,913 --> 01:44:16,207
Vladislav Tretyak,
considered the best goalie in the world,

1235
01:44:16,291 --> 01:44:18,459
in the nets for the Soviet Union.

1236
01:44:18,543 --> 01:44:21,170
The US team in white,
skating up to center ice.

1237
01:44:21,255 --> 01:44:23,881
The Soviet Union in red, all business.

1238
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:26,759
And here we go.

1239
01:44:29,179 --> 01:44:32,807
Face-offwon by Mikhailov.
Back to Kasatonov.

1240
01:44:32,891 --> 01:44:34,475
Move on him. Move on him.

1241
01:44:34,518 --> 01:44:37,353
Carried up ice by Kasatonov
who passes to Petrov.

1242
01:44:38,021 --> 01:44:41,857
Puck picked up by Morrow.
Pressured by Mikhailov.

1243
01:44:41,984 --> 01:44:45,152
The pass in front of the US net.
A shot deflected by Craig.

1244
01:44:45,195 --> 01:44:48,030
- Watch the middle.
- Keep it out of the middle.

1245
01:44:48,115 --> 01:44:50,533
Jim Craig tested for the first time.

1246
01:44:50,617 --> 01:44:54,578
Dave Silk with the puck along
the boards. Taken away by Kasatonov.

1247
01:44:54,663 --> 01:44:58,374
Up ahead to Petrov.
Petrov streaking up the boards.

1248
01:44:59,167 --> 01:45:01,877
Powering past Ramsey.
Centering pass to Kharlamov.

1249
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:04,213
He shoots. Saved by Jim Craig.

1250
01:45:04,798 --> 01:45:06,882
Puck cleared out ofthe US zone.

1251
01:45:06,967 --> 01:45:10,720
Big hit on McClanahan
by the Soviet captain Boris Mikhailov.

1252
01:45:11,054 --> 01:45:14,557
Krutov with a hard shot
from the high slot. Craig with a save.

1253
01:45:14,641 --> 01:45:18,894
Golikov across to Petrov.
Again Craig is equal to the task.

1254
01:45:18,937 --> 01:45:20,354
Use those boards.

1255
01:45:20,397 --> 01:45:22,356
Across the US blue line.

1256
01:45:22,399 --> 01:45:25,651
Passes across to Kharlamov.
Shot. Stopped.

1257
01:45:25,736 --> 01:45:27,903
Petrov trying for the rebound.

1258
01:45:27,988 --> 01:45:31,324
To Makarov at the point.
He fires it along the boards.

1259
01:45:31,408 --> 01:45:34,285
Picked up behind the net
by Buzz Schneider.

1260
01:45:34,369 --> 01:45:35,870
- Come on.
- Slash.

1261
01:45:35,912 --> 01:45:40,916
Schneider losing it. Out to the point.
Slap shot. Deflected in.

1262
01:45:41,001 --> 01:45:42,251
That was a slash!

1263
01:45:42,419 --> 01:45:45,004
The Soviet Union takes
a one to nothing lead.

1264
01:45:45,088 --> 01:45:48,466
Kasatonov's slap shot
was deflected in past Craig.

1265
01:45:48,967 --> 01:45:52,762
So the Soviet Union leads one to nothing
early in the first period.

1266
01:45:52,971 --> 01:45:55,473
Forget about it now.
Come on. Let's go.

1267
01:45:55,599 --> 01:45:59,393
Mikhailov and Christoff
facing off at center ice.

1268
01:45:59,436 --> 01:46:02,605
Here we go, boys. Move it.

1269
01:46:02,773 --> 01:46:04,774
Kharlamov to Mikhailov.

1270
01:46:05,275 --> 01:46:07,818
Mikhailov up the boards
and into the corner.

1271
01:46:07,903 --> 01:46:11,155
To Kharlamov for a quick shot.
Good save by Jim Craig.

1272
01:46:11,239 --> 01:46:13,657
Makarov with the puck.
Craig gets his stick on it.

1273
01:46:13,742 --> 01:46:15,326
Good save, Jimmy.

1274
01:46:15,410 --> 01:46:19,288
The US in possession now.
Ramsey moving it up to Johnson.

1275
01:46:19,373 --> 01:46:21,415
Johnson is hung up by Bilyaletdinov,

1276
01:46:21,500 --> 01:46:25,336
who feeds it around the boards
where it's picked up by Krutov.

1277
01:46:26,129 --> 01:46:30,257
Golikov crossing the blue line.
He's hit hard by Ken Morrow.

1278
01:46:30,300 --> 01:46:32,802
The puck is picked up by Eruzione.

1279
01:46:32,969 --> 01:46:35,554
And he's sent hard into the boards
by Krutov.

1280
01:46:35,639 --> 01:46:38,432
Johnson with it now.
Flying up the boards.

1281
01:46:38,475 --> 01:46:41,227
You got time. You got time.

1282
01:46:41,311 --> 01:46:44,480
OC, go. Buzzy, get in there.

1283
01:46:46,525 --> 01:46:49,360
The Soviets control it. Kasatonov.

1284
01:46:51,071 --> 01:46:53,781
Krutov with the puck now.

1285
01:46:54,533 --> 01:46:59,412
A big hit by Jack O'Callahan.
Pavelich up ahead to Schneider.

1286
01:47:00,997 --> 01:47:02,873
Slap shot goes in!

1287
01:47:09,965 --> 01:47:13,884
That's the type of goal you don't expect
someone like Tretyak to give up.

1288
01:47:13,969 --> 01:47:16,929
The United States ties the game at one.

1289
01:47:17,013 --> 01:47:20,766
Jack O'Callahan,
returning after a serious knee injury,

1290
01:47:20,851 --> 01:47:23,686
making a big contribution
with that hit on Krutov.

1291
01:47:23,770 --> 01:47:27,523
Number 16, Pavelich. Time, 14:03.

1292
01:47:31,361 --> 01:47:36,073
Petrov to Kharlamov. Skating
into the US zone. Tying up O'Callahan.

1293
01:47:36,158 --> 01:47:40,911
Golikov. Cross-ice pass to Petrov.
He shoots. And Craig is right there.

1294
01:47:40,996 --> 01:47:44,540
Picked up by O'Callahan.
Moves up to Pavelich.

1295
01:47:44,624 --> 01:47:47,209
Through the middle.
Crossing the Soviet blue line.

1296
01:47:47,252 --> 01:47:49,837
Centering pass. Cleared by Fetisov.

1297
01:47:49,921 --> 01:47:52,756
- Talk to each other.
- Play your position.

1298
01:47:52,841 --> 01:47:55,801
Krutov with the puck.
Through the neutral zone.

1299
01:47:55,886 --> 01:47:58,220
Knifes through the defense.
Right in front.

1300
01:48:02,142 --> 01:48:05,644
Picked up by Mark Johnson.
Nice move around Bilyaletdinov.

1301
01:48:06,646 --> 01:48:09,440
Another great move around Makarov.

1302
01:48:09,524 --> 01:48:13,360
Checked by Golikov
and sent flying into the boards.

1303
01:48:14,196 --> 01:48:16,197
The Soviets out oftheir own zone.

1304
01:48:16,281 --> 01:48:18,741
Pick him up.
Don't let him through the middle.

1305
01:48:18,825 --> 01:48:21,827
Golikov crossing center ice.
Leaves it for Makarov.

1306
01:48:21,912 --> 01:48:24,955
Makarov around Morrow.
And he scores.

1307
01:48:29,002 --> 01:48:33,255
Makarov put the puck right between
Morrow's legs, skated in and scored.

1308
01:48:33,340 --> 01:48:37,259
That was a textbook Soviet passing play.
Beautifully done.

1309
01:48:37,344 --> 01:48:40,095
Once they get rolling,
it's almost impossible to stop them.

1310
01:48:40,138 --> 01:48:42,515
Twenty-four gets the goal.
Give 25 the assist.

1311
01:48:42,599 --> 01:48:46,352
With the Soviets leading two to one,
the US team knows that all too well

1312
01:48:46,436 --> 01:48:52,191
after what happened with these two teams
at Madison Square Garden 13 days ago.

1313
01:48:52,275 --> 01:48:55,986
Referee Karl Kaisla calling
the players over for the face-off.

1314
01:48:56,071 --> 01:49:00,783
You can hear the crowd
trying to reinvigorate this US team.

1315
01:49:00,867 --> 01:49:04,828
Face-offwon by the Soviets.
Fetisov across to Kasatonov.

1316
01:49:04,913 --> 01:49:07,706
He circles behind his own net.
Leaves it for Fetisov.

1317
01:49:07,791 --> 01:49:11,126
- Keep the pressure on them.
- Moves it over to Mikhailov.

1318
01:49:11,211 --> 01:49:13,587
- Pick him up.
- Watch the pass.

1319
01:49:13,672 --> 01:49:16,966
To Maltsev. Over to Makarov.
Shot stopped by Craig.

1320
01:49:17,050 --> 01:49:18,801
Don't let them have that middle.

1321
01:49:18,885 --> 01:49:21,053
Less than a half-minute
in the first period.

1322
01:49:21,137 --> 01:49:23,722
The US can't clear it.
Petrov with the puck.

1323
01:49:23,807 --> 01:49:26,058
Quick pass to Kharlamov.
Stopped by Craig.

1324
01:49:26,142 --> 01:49:29,186
Petrov tries for the rebound.
Craig knocks it away.

1325
01:49:29,938 --> 01:49:33,148
Kasatonov with a shot.
Craig with another save.

1326
01:49:33,191 --> 01:49:34,191
Play it out.

1327
01:49:35,402 --> 01:49:37,570
And the US team finally clears it.

1328
01:49:37,654 --> 01:49:40,906
It looks like the US will end
the period only a goal down,

1329
01:49:40,991 --> 01:49:42,449
a tremendous achievement.

1330
01:49:44,327 --> 01:49:45,327
Johnson, go.

1331
01:49:45,412 --> 01:49:48,372
The puck is picked up by Christian
in the neutral zone.

1332
01:49:48,957 --> 01:49:51,375
Long shot. Easy save by Tretyak.

1333
01:49:52,752 --> 01:49:55,296
But Johnson is there. And scores!

1334
01:49:56,923 --> 01:50:00,467
With one second to play in the period.
The clock shows nothing.

1335
01:50:00,552 --> 01:50:03,887
It was stopped at one when we looked up
and the goal was scored.

1336
01:50:04,264 --> 01:50:08,517
Right now it shows nothing as the
period, apparently, has come to an end.

1337
01:50:08,685 --> 01:50:11,020
But the United States has tied the game.

1338
01:50:15,609 --> 01:50:17,943
A big, big goal for the US team.

1339
01:50:18,028 --> 01:50:20,821
Dave Christian took a shot
from the other side of center ice,

1340
01:50:20,905 --> 01:50:23,324
knowing there was almost no time
on the clock.

1341
01:50:23,366 --> 01:50:25,618
The rebound comes right out
to Mark Johnson,

1342
01:50:25,702 --> 01:50:28,912
who goes wide of Tretyak to tie it up.

1343
01:50:29,456 --> 01:50:31,957
Tikhonov very upset.
Questioning the goal.

1344
01:50:32,042 --> 01:50:33,876
The time on the clock shows zero.

1345
01:50:34,002 --> 01:50:38,380
Kaisla, the referee, indicating that
the goal stands and the period is over.

1346
01:50:38,465 --> 01:50:41,550
And this crowd is electrified.

1347
01:50:42,385 --> 01:50:46,305
Tikhonov, like his team, not normally
prone to showing much emotion.

1348
01:50:48,725 --> 01:50:51,894
As the teams skate off
to their dressing rooms, this game

1349
01:50:51,978 --> 01:50:56,065
is tied at two on an incredible
last-second goal by Mark Johnson.

1350
01:51:01,446 --> 01:51:03,489
Wow! Thanks, Mean Joe.

1351
01:51:09,746 --> 01:51:11,497
We're back for the second period

1352
01:51:11,581 --> 01:51:14,750
for what is turning out to be
a very exciting game.

1353
01:51:14,793 --> 01:51:17,920
If you're justjoining us, there were
four goals scored in the first period,

1354
01:51:17,962 --> 01:51:20,923
two by the Soviets,
two by the Americans.

1355
01:51:21,007 --> 01:51:25,094
There's a change for the Soviet Union
as Vladimir Myshkin becomes goalie

1356
01:51:25,220 --> 01:51:28,597
after Tretyak had given up two goals
in the first period.

1357
01:51:28,682 --> 01:51:29,932
Al, this is a big move.

1358
01:51:30,016 --> 01:51:33,936
Tretyak's been Tikhonov's
bread and butter for a decade.

1359
01:51:34,020 --> 01:51:36,355
Still, Myshkin is a very capable backup.

1360
01:51:36,439 --> 01:51:40,943
You just put the best goaltender
in the world on the bench.

1361
01:51:41,027 --> 01:51:44,571
It is very uncommon
to see Vladislav Tretyak taken out,

1362
01:51:44,656 --> 01:51:46,907
and something
we have not seen in these Olympics.

1363
01:51:47,367 --> 01:51:49,952
Let's go, now, boys. Come on.

1364
01:51:51,329 --> 01:51:54,581
And here we go.
The second period is under way.

1365
01:51:54,624 --> 01:51:58,794
The Conehead line out for
the United States. Jim Craig in goal.

1366
01:51:58,837 --> 01:52:01,755
Krutov with the puck.
Down the right side.

1367
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:05,008
Centering pass. Shot.
Swatted away by Craig.

1368
01:52:05,093 --> 01:52:06,552
Attaboy, Jimmy.

1369
01:52:06,970 --> 01:52:09,638
Harrington breaks out.
Gets behind the defense.

1370
01:52:09,723 --> 01:52:12,850
He has a breakaway.
He can give the US the lead.

1371
01:52:12,934 --> 01:52:14,977
He shoots. Stopped by Myshkin.

1372
01:52:17,355 --> 01:52:21,942
Fetisov up to Maltsev.
Maltsev gets past Christian. Shoots.

1373
01:52:22,819 --> 01:52:25,946
The rebound. Maltsev scores.

1374
01:52:26,030 --> 01:52:28,323
The Soviets take the lead three to two.

1375
01:52:33,413 --> 01:52:35,998
Jim Craig knocked down
on the play by Kharlamov,

1376
01:52:36,124 --> 01:52:40,335
allowing Maltsev an easy goal
on an open net.

1377
01:52:40,420 --> 01:52:44,923
- Jim Craig's not getting up, Ken.
- This could be devastating to the US.

1378
01:52:45,008 --> 01:52:47,134
Craig's been the anchor ofthis team,

1379
01:52:47,177 --> 01:52:50,053
playing every minute of every game
in Lake Placid.

1380
01:52:51,055 --> 01:52:54,183
Herb Brooks may now be faced
with replacing Craig

1381
01:52:54,225 --> 01:52:56,518
with his backup goalie Steve Janaszak.

1382
01:52:56,603 --> 01:52:59,396
Janaszak played
on Brooks' championship team

1383
01:52:59,481 --> 01:53:02,649
last year at the University of
Minnesota. He's played very little

1384
01:53:02,692 --> 01:53:05,861
over the last six months
and not at all in these Olympics.

1385
01:53:05,945 --> 01:53:08,947
- Jimmy, you need Doc?
- No. I'm good. Give me a second.

1386
01:53:12,702 --> 01:53:13,869
Take your time.

1387
01:53:13,953 --> 01:53:16,038
Jim Craig back on his feet now.

1388
01:53:16,122 --> 01:53:19,166
Shaking it off, and it appears
he'll remain in this game.

1389
01:53:19,209 --> 01:53:20,209
Attaboy, Jimmy.

1390
01:53:20,293 --> 01:53:23,670
A huge hand
from this very appreciative crowd.

1391
01:53:28,009 --> 01:53:30,427
Seventeen minutes
till the end of the second period.

1392
01:53:30,512 --> 01:53:34,056
The Soviet Union, three.
The United States, two.

1393
01:53:40,897 --> 01:53:43,357
We're back
for the start of the third period.

1394
01:53:43,441 --> 01:53:48,278
Twenty minutes left in a game that's
closer than most anyone anticipated.

1395
01:53:48,363 --> 01:53:50,447
The teams were tied two-two
after the first.

1396
01:53:50,532 --> 01:53:53,242
And the Soviets are
now leading three to two.

1397
01:53:53,326 --> 01:53:55,244
Al Michaels at the Olympic Center

1398
01:53:55,328 --> 01:53:58,872
with former Montreal Canadiens goalie
Ken Dryden.

1399
01:53:58,957 --> 01:54:02,251
The American team
comes into this medal round unbeaten.

1400
01:54:02,377 --> 01:54:05,963
The Soviets are also unbeaten,
winning all five oftheir games,

1401
01:54:06,047 --> 01:54:08,799
scoring 51 goals in the process.

1402
01:54:08,925 --> 01:54:11,760
The US,
four wins and a tie against Sweden,

1403
01:54:11,803 --> 01:54:16,682
and a huge upset win over
Czechoslovakia eight days ago.

1404
01:54:16,766 --> 01:54:20,394
Herb Brooks' young team
is trying to overcome enormous odds

1405
01:54:20,436 --> 01:54:23,313
to beat the best team
in the world tonight.

1406
01:54:27,277 --> 01:54:29,903
Boys. Come here. Bring it in.

1407
01:54:40,540 --> 01:54:42,332
Listen to them.

1408
01:54:46,045 --> 01:54:48,797
That's what you've done.

1409
01:54:48,840 --> 01:54:52,801
We've come from behind in every game
so far and we can do it again.

1410
01:54:55,471 --> 01:54:57,806
We can beat these guys.

1411
01:54:58,766 --> 01:55:00,767
Get your guys to the face-off.

1412
01:55:01,603 --> 01:55:04,897
- Everybody in.
- Come on, boys.

1413
01:55:04,981 --> 01:55:07,649
- Who do you play for?
- USA!

1414
01:55:13,031 --> 01:55:15,157
Come on, boys.

1415
01:55:16,034 --> 01:55:18,660
As the third period begins,
the crowd is chanting.

1416
01:55:18,745 --> 01:55:20,829
Everyone on their feet.

1417
01:55:20,914 --> 01:55:24,666
The Americans are winless
against the Soviets since 1960.

1418
01:55:24,792 --> 01:55:26,752
Since that day at Squaw Valley,

1419
01:55:26,836 --> 01:55:30,672
it's been 20 years since a US team
has defeated the Soviets.

1420
01:55:30,715 --> 01:55:36,136
The Soviets have been gold medal
winners in every Olympics since 1960.

1421
01:55:36,804 --> 01:55:38,972
The top Soviet line
is out there right now.

1422
01:55:39,057 --> 01:55:42,976
Mikhailov at center.
He's flanked by Petrov and Kharlamov.

1423
01:55:43,061 --> 01:55:45,854
On defense, Kasatonov and Fetisov.

1424
01:55:45,897 --> 01:55:48,732
And in net, Vladimir Myshkin...

1425
01:56:05,750 --> 01:56:08,210
Face-offwon by Johnson.

1426
01:56:08,294 --> 01:56:12,881
Ramsey with the puck. Up to Johnson.
Johnson. Wrist shot.

1427
01:56:12,924 --> 01:56:14,841
Pick him up.

1428
01:56:14,926 --> 01:56:17,719
Puck is picked up by Kasatonov.
To Mikhailov.

1429
01:56:17,804 --> 01:56:20,263
To Kharlamov,
who carries it into the US zone.

1430
01:56:20,390 --> 01:56:22,933
Shot. Stick save by Jim Craig.

1431
01:56:24,602 --> 01:56:28,105
Picked up in the corner by Krutov.
Centering pass. Shot. Saved by Craig.

1432
01:56:28,189 --> 01:56:31,900
Back to the point for Kasatonov.
Slap shot. Stopped. And again.

1433
01:56:31,985 --> 01:56:33,610
Thattaboy, Jimmy.

1434
01:56:33,695 --> 01:56:35,654
Craig tested early in the third period.

1435
01:56:35,738 --> 01:56:39,157
Christian with the puck now.
And he goes down.

1436
01:56:39,242 --> 01:56:41,785
We've got a penalty
coming up on the Soviets.

1437
01:56:41,869 --> 01:56:44,371
Petrov going offfor slashing.

1438
01:56:44,414 --> 01:56:46,081
Coneheads. Let's go.

1439
01:56:46,124 --> 01:56:48,083
This is a big opportunity for the US.

1440
01:56:48,167 --> 01:56:51,545
They haven't been able to go
on the offense for some time now,

1441
01:56:51,629 --> 01:56:54,214
and this is the chance.

1442
01:56:54,257 --> 01:56:58,427
- Soviet Union penalty to number 16.
- Let's take advantage of this.

1443
01:57:00,263 --> 01:57:03,015
O'Callahan moving it up.
Slips by Kharlamov.

1444
01:57:03,099 --> 01:57:04,349
Set it up, boys!

1445
01:57:05,393 --> 01:57:10,355
A long pass from Harrington.
Harrington inside the Soviet blue line.

1446
01:57:10,440 --> 01:57:12,441
Back to O'Callahan.

1447
01:57:12,483 --> 01:57:14,776
Back to Harrington now.

1448
01:57:14,861 --> 01:57:17,529
To Ramsey at the point.
Over to Schneider.

1449
01:57:17,613 --> 01:57:19,948
Shot. Stopped by Myshkin.

1450
01:57:20,700 --> 01:57:23,326
Bilyaletdinov clears the zone.

1451
01:57:23,411 --> 01:57:26,121
Keep it going now, boys.
Keep up the intensity.

1452
01:57:26,205 --> 01:57:29,666
Across to McClanahan.
Back across to Silk.

1453
01:57:29,751 --> 01:57:32,127
Shot deflected by Myshkin.

1454
01:57:32,211 --> 01:57:35,964
The Soviets
clear the puck around the boards.

1455
01:57:37,633 --> 01:57:39,968
Sixteen seconds, sixteen seconds!

1456
01:57:40,303 --> 01:57:43,138
The US team with one more chance
on this power play.

1457
01:57:43,264 --> 01:57:45,140
Last rush. Come on, Silky.

1458
01:57:45,808 --> 01:57:47,976
- Dave Silk crossing.
- Silky, I'm with you.

1459
01:57:49,145 --> 01:57:51,104
He's checked. Loose puck.

1460
01:57:51,230 --> 01:57:53,315
Picked up by Johnson. He scores!

1461
01:57:54,233 --> 01:57:58,028
Mark Johnson, with only four seconds
left in the power play,

1462
01:57:58,154 --> 01:58:00,655
ties the game at three.

1463
01:58:00,698 --> 01:58:01,865
There we go.

1464
01:58:03,659 --> 01:58:07,496
USA goal scored
by number ten, Johnson.

1465
01:58:07,622 --> 01:58:12,084
Assist, number eight, Silk. Time, 4:43.

1466
01:58:12,168 --> 01:58:16,004
Ken, a couple months ago, did you
think this was remotely possible?

1467
01:58:16,089 --> 01:58:17,881
No, absolutely not.

1468
01:58:18,007 --> 01:58:21,885
But the thing with the US team
is they're very young, very talented.

1469
01:58:21,969 --> 01:58:24,096
And now they're beginning to believe.

1470
01:58:24,180 --> 01:58:26,181
That's my boy.

1471
01:58:26,307 --> 01:58:31,645
The Americans, just as the penalty was
about to expire, score to tie the game.

1472
01:58:31,729 --> 01:58:35,941
Three-three, the United States
and the Soviet Union.

1473
01:58:36,025 --> 01:58:38,026
Face-off controlled by the Soviets.

1474
01:58:38,069 --> 01:58:40,862
Kharlamov on the attack.
Down into the corner.

1475
01:58:40,988 --> 01:58:44,407
Drop pass. Kasatonov with a shot. Wide.

1476
01:58:44,534 --> 01:58:48,203
And the Americans with the puck.
Clear it.

1477
01:58:48,871 --> 01:58:51,581
Maltsev streaks across the US blue line.

1478
01:58:51,707 --> 01:58:55,001
Over to Makarov. Craig with the save.

1479
01:58:55,044 --> 01:58:59,131
- Kasatonov from the point. Craig again.
- Attaboy, Jimmy.

1480
01:58:59,215 --> 01:59:00,674
Keep them wide.

1481
01:59:02,051 --> 01:59:03,093
Come on, Buzzy.

1482
01:59:04,679 --> 01:59:08,223
- Harrington up to Schneider.
- Rizzo, go.

1483
01:59:08,266 --> 01:59:10,892
Schneider gets rid of it
and heads to the bench.

1484
01:59:11,018 --> 01:59:12,936
All right, Buzzy.

1485
01:59:13,688 --> 01:59:16,898
Bilyaletdinov
picks up the puck in the corner.

1486
01:59:17,775 --> 01:59:19,985
Checked by Harrington.

1487
01:59:20,069 --> 01:59:22,737
- Rizzo, Rizzo!
- Pavelich has it now.

1488
01:59:22,822 --> 01:59:24,739
Over to Eruzione.

1489
01:59:28,077 --> 01:59:30,370
He shoots. He scores!

1490
01:59:32,373 --> 01:59:34,124
Eruzione!

1491
01:59:36,961 --> 01:59:39,296
And now we've got bedlam.

1492
01:59:40,339 --> 01:59:43,258
Anyone who was at
Madison Square Garden two weeks ago

1493
01:59:43,301 --> 01:59:46,928
who's watching this game tonight
has got to be shocked.

1494
01:59:48,598 --> 01:59:50,640
I love Brooks' reaction.

1495
01:59:57,940 --> 02:00:02,402
- Thattaway, Rizzo!
- Yes!

1496
02:00:06,574 --> 02:00:09,117
And the chant resumes.

1497
02:00:09,202 --> 02:00:13,121
Mike Eruzione out of Boston University,
the captain of this US team,

1498
02:00:13,206 --> 02:00:15,916
hasjust put the US ahead
for the first time

1499
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,752
exactly halfway
through the third period.

1500
02:00:19,295 --> 02:00:23,381
USA goal scored by number 21, Eruzione.

1501
02:00:23,466 --> 02:00:26,384
This US team was demoralized
by the Soviets.

1502
02:00:26,469 --> 02:00:30,972
Very tentative. Very nervous.
Very much in awe ofthe Soviet team.

1503
02:00:31,098 --> 02:00:35,644
And this is a US team
that tonight is not in awe of anyone.

1504
02:00:37,480 --> 02:00:39,981
Come on, boys. Here we go.

1505
02:00:40,024 --> 02:00:42,150
Ten minutes left to play.

1506
02:00:42,235 --> 02:00:44,819
The face-offto Petrov. To Kharlamov.

1507
02:00:45,238 --> 02:00:47,322
Krutov crossing the US blue line.

1508
02:00:47,365 --> 02:00:49,908
Quick pass back to Maltsev. Shot. Save.

1509
02:00:49,992 --> 02:00:51,576
Get it out of there.

1510
02:00:51,661 --> 02:00:55,121
Kasatonov at the point.
A drive. Just wide ofthe net.

1511
02:00:55,248 --> 02:01:00,168
Krutov with the puck. Right in front.
And another huge save by Jim Craig.

1512
02:01:00,253 --> 02:01:03,505
- Play your game.
- Johnson moving across to McClanahan.

1513
02:01:03,631 --> 02:01:06,383
- It's intercepted by Kharlamov.
- Take him wide.

1514
02:01:06,467 --> 02:01:08,969
Kharlamov leading
the charge up the ice.

1515
02:01:09,011 --> 02:01:11,846
He fires a shot. Glove save. Jim Craig.

1516
02:01:11,889 --> 02:01:14,307
Keep it moving.

1517
02:01:14,350 --> 02:01:17,310
Wrist shot from Petrov.
Craig again with the stop.

1518
02:01:17,353 --> 02:01:22,857
Kharlamov back to Kasatonov
at the point. He shoots. Stick save.

1519
02:01:22,942 --> 02:01:24,109
Attaboy, Jimmy.

1520
02:01:24,193 --> 02:01:26,611
Rebound out to McClanahan.
Can't clear it.

1521
02:01:27,530 --> 02:01:30,824
Great play.
McClanahan dives to clear the zone.

1522
02:01:30,908 --> 02:01:33,326
7:10 remaining in the third period.

1523
02:01:33,452 --> 02:01:37,289
We're gonna go with short shifts, boys,
30 to 40 seconds.

1524
02:01:37,373 --> 02:01:41,209
Short shifts, 30 to 40 seconds.
Keep an eye on it, Doc.

1525
02:01:42,837 --> 02:01:46,131
Kharlamov with a long pass to Mikhailov.
Over the blue line.

1526
02:01:46,215 --> 02:01:50,302
To Petrov right in front. Shot.
Sliding save by Craig.

1527
02:01:50,386 --> 02:01:52,554
Switch them up. Let's go. Go.

1528
02:01:52,638 --> 02:01:56,516
Petrov over to Maltsev.
Off to Kasatonov at the point.

1529
02:01:56,559 --> 02:01:58,727
He sends it around the boards.

1530
02:01:58,853 --> 02:02:02,564
Picked up by Fetisov. Hit hard by Silk.

1531
02:02:02,606 --> 02:02:04,065
Get it out.

1532
02:02:04,108 --> 02:02:06,359
Picked up and cleared by Morrow.

1533
02:02:06,402 --> 02:02:09,487
- And the Soviets regroup.
- Keep it going.

1534
02:02:09,572 --> 02:02:12,073
Five minutes to play
in the third period.

1535
02:02:13,075 --> 02:02:15,076
Kasatonov leaves it for Mikhailov.

1536
02:02:16,912 --> 02:02:21,541
Mikhailov moves it over
to Kharlamov. Slap shot.

1537
02:02:22,084 --> 02:02:24,169
Knocked away by Craig.

1538
02:02:24,253 --> 02:02:28,298
- Chip it out!
- Ramsey moves it ahead to Pavelich.

1539
02:02:28,424 --> 02:02:30,467
- Get ready.
- Through the neutral zone.

1540
02:02:30,551 --> 02:02:33,011
And he's run into the boards
by Bilyaletdinov.

1541
02:02:33,095 --> 02:02:37,223
- Change them up. Let's go.
- ...with 3:50 to play in the game.

1542
02:02:37,266 --> 02:02:39,309
Go off. Get off the ice.

1543
02:02:39,435 --> 02:02:43,938
He moves it up to Krutov. Krutov
with the puck. Through the neutral zone.

1544
02:02:43,981 --> 02:02:47,108
Moving in on the net.
That's stopped by Craig.

1545
02:02:47,193 --> 02:02:50,820
- Thattaboy, Jimmy.
- Play your game, boys.

1546
02:02:52,531 --> 02:02:54,949
Loose puck in the corner.
Krutov chasing it.

1547
02:02:55,034 --> 02:02:57,035
Schneider behind him, fighting for it.

1548
02:02:57,119 --> 02:03:00,455
Bring it off the board.
Bring it off the board!

1549
02:03:00,998 --> 02:03:04,959
3:19 left to play.
O'Callahan moving out.

1550
02:03:05,002 --> 02:03:07,545
- How are we doing, Doc?
- Forty-two.

1551
02:03:07,630 --> 02:03:09,381
Change them up. Change them up!

1552
02:03:09,465 --> 02:03:12,509
- Let's go.
- Golikov moving it up.

1553
02:03:12,635 --> 02:03:15,053
Leaves it for Makarov.

1554
02:03:16,555 --> 02:03:17,972
Saved by Craig.

1555
02:03:21,268 --> 02:03:22,811
Poise and control.

1556
02:03:22,937 --> 02:03:25,897
McClanahan scrapping for it.
Mikhailov in there.

1557
02:03:25,981 --> 02:03:29,567
Hard hit by Ramsey. 2:17 remaining.

1558
02:03:29,652 --> 02:03:34,030
No more changes
until the next whistle.

1559
02:03:34,115 --> 02:03:35,115
Come on, Jimmy.

1560
02:03:36,200 --> 02:03:37,951
Loose puck in the corner.

1561
02:03:38,077 --> 02:03:41,371
When they pull Myshkin,
I want fresh legs. OC.

1562
02:03:41,455 --> 02:03:42,831
Yeah.

1563
02:03:42,873 --> 02:03:46,960
- Kharlamov to Mikhailov. Ramsey diving.
- Fend him off!

1564
02:03:47,002 --> 02:03:52,424
Mikhailov over the blue line.
Across to Petrov. Shot. Save.

1565
02:03:54,510 --> 02:03:57,345
I'm amazed
how well conditioned this US team is.

1566
02:03:57,388 --> 02:04:00,682
I've never seen the Soviets
outskated this late in the game.

1567
02:04:00,724 --> 02:04:04,144
That's exactly
what the US team is doing right now.

1568
02:04:04,603 --> 02:04:08,982
Golikov across to Petrov.
Shot. Kicked away by Craig.

1569
02:04:09,066 --> 02:04:10,191
Way to go, Jimmy.

1570
02:04:10,276 --> 02:04:13,945
Over to Maltsev. Moving in on the net.
That's stopped by Craig.

1571
02:04:14,029 --> 02:04:17,949
Chip it out. Come on. That's it.

1572
02:04:25,082 --> 02:04:28,293
- They're not pulling Myshkin.
- Kharlamov to Krutov.

1573
02:04:28,377 --> 02:04:30,378
He doesn't know what to do.

1574
02:04:32,882 --> 02:04:35,341
Thirty-six seconds left to play.

1575
02:04:35,384 --> 02:04:38,094
Makarov over the blue line.
To Maltsev. Fires.

1576
02:04:38,179 --> 02:04:39,762
Another save.

1577
02:04:40,139 --> 02:04:44,559
Fighting for possession. Morrow
trying to get it away from Kharlamov.

1578
02:04:44,643 --> 02:04:46,060
Come on.

1579
02:04:49,482 --> 02:04:51,900
Coming to you
from the Olympic ice arena,

1580
02:04:51,984 --> 02:04:55,904
the US, huge underdogs,
leading the Soviet Union.

1581
02:04:57,239 --> 02:05:00,575
Johnson over to Ramsey.
Bilyaletdinov checked by Ramsey.

1582
02:05:00,701 --> 02:05:02,869
McClanahan is there. The puck is loose.

1583
02:05:02,912 --> 02:05:06,623
Eleven seconds. Ten seconds.
The countdown going on right now.

1584
02:05:06,707 --> 02:05:10,001
Morrow up to Silk.
Five seconds left in the game.

1585
02:05:10,085 --> 02:05:12,879
Do you believe in miracles? Yes!

1586
02:07:09,913 --> 02:07:11,873
Yes! Yes!

1587
02:07:42,154 --> 02:07:45,531
Two days later,
the miracle was made complete.

1588
02:07:46,950 --> 02:07:50,662
My boys defeated Finland
to win the gold medal,

1589
02:07:50,746 --> 02:07:53,247
coming from behind once again.

1590
02:07:54,750 --> 02:07:59,796
As I watched them out there,
celebrating on the ice,

1591
02:07:59,880 --> 02:08:02,465
I realized that Patti had been right.

1592
02:08:04,510 --> 02:08:07,345
It was a lot more than a hockey game.

1593
02:08:08,597 --> 02:08:14,602
Not only for those who watched it,
but for those who played in it.

1594
02:08:18,982 --> 02:08:22,360
I've often been asked in the years
since Lake Placid,

1595
02:08:22,444 --> 02:08:25,530
what was the best moment for me?

1596
02:08:25,614 --> 02:08:28,032
Well, it was here.

1597
02:08:28,117 --> 02:08:32,829
The sight of 20 young men
of such differing backgrounds

1598
02:08:32,913 --> 02:08:35,248
now standing as one.

1599
02:08:36,291 --> 02:08:42,296
Young men willing to sacrifice so much
ofthemselves all for an unknown.

1600
02:08:44,466 --> 02:08:48,886
A few years later, the US began using
professional athletes at the Games.

1601
02:08:49,012 --> 02:08:50,555
Dream teams.

1602
02:08:51,724 --> 02:08:53,808
I always found that term ironic

1603
02:08:53,851 --> 02:08:57,979
because now that we have dream teams,
we seldom ever get to dream.

1604
02:08:59,481 --> 02:09:03,985
But on one weekend,
as America and the world watched,

1605
02:09:04,069 --> 02:09:09,407
a group of remarkable young men
gave the nation what it needed most.

1606
02:09:10,200 --> 02:09:13,703
A chance, for one night,
not only to dream.

1607
02:09:14,663 --> 02:09:20,084
But a chance, once again... to believe.

1608
02:15:29,830 --> 02:15:34,291
And I know you'll do a good job.
See you guys later, OK?
