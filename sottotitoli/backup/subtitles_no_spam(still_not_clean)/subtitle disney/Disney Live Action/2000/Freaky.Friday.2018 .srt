00:11:40,434 --> 00:11:42,769
Hold still, honey, hold still.

184
00:11:42,853 --> 00:11:45,897
I promise there will be
serious consequences for her.

185
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,649
Hey, Tessie!

186
00:11:47,732 --> 00:11:50,068
Hey, Dad, you're early!

187
00:11:50,151 --> 00:11:51,736
- What?
- You're early!

188
00:11:51,819 --> 00:11:53,529
I can't...

189
00:11:53,571 --> 00:11:56,365
You're early.

190
00:11:56,407 --> 00:11:58,617
Hold on.
I need my glasses.

191
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,868
Grandpa!

192
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:03,371
Hey, monkey!
Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

193
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:06,958
What is this?
One of them thongs?

194
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:08,376
I don't want to know.

195
00:12:08,418 --> 00:12:10,545
What's up?
What's up?

196
00:12:10,628 --> 00:12:13,506
- Hey, guys.
- You guys know these yard apes?

197
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:15,966
You're early.

198
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:16,717
What?

199
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,969
Glad you could make it.

200
00:12:19,052 --> 00:12:20,887
I brought
an early wedding present.

201
00:12:20,971 --> 00:12:21,722
What?

202
00:12:24,099 --> 00:12:26,267
I thought I'd get
the author to sign it.

203
00:12:26,351 --> 00:12:26,935
What?

204
00:12:27,018 --> 00:12:29,812
- I thought I'd ask...
- I can't hear you. Hold on.

205
00:12:29,896 --> 00:12:31,314
Let's get out of here.

206
00:12:31,397 --> 00:12:33,107
What do you have
under your shirt?

207
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:34,400
Ryan, could you?

208
00:13:14,812 --> 00:13:16,939
- Oh, bummer.
- Not again.

209
00:13:16,981 --> 00:13:19,441
Time's up!
It's after 6:00!

210
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,443
Mmm!

211
00:13:21,485 --> 00:13:22,486
Hey, guys.

212
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:24,863
You're gonna spoil your dinner.

213
00:13:25,947 --> 00:13:29,659
You know, this Dad thing
can be hard or easy.

214
00:13:34,163 --> 00:13:35,789
Don't let her see you.

215
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:38,876
Good, now we can hear.

216
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,878
Speak for yourself.
I could use those little notes.

217
00:13:43,171 --> 00:13:46,174
She hates when I pull the plug.
Get ready for the fireworks.

218
00:13:46,216 --> 00:13:47,300
Did I say hello?

219
00:13:47,342 --> 00:13:48,676
I must have missed it.

220
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,137
- Hello.
- Hello.

221
00:13:52,305 --> 00:13:54,223
Get a room!

222
00:13:57,267 --> 00:13:59,186
Go, go, go, go!

223
00:14:03,148 --> 00:14:04,190
[Cellphone rings]

224
00:14:04,274 --> 00:14:07,402
- This is...
- Just one second. One second.

225
00:14:07,485 --> 00:14:09,821
Okay, but you owe me.

226
00:14:09,904 --> 00:14:11,989
Hello.

227
00:14:12,031 --> 00:14:13,657
Yes, this is she.

228
00:14:17,036 --> 00:14:18,912
Oh, really?

229
00:14:20,205 --> 00:14:22,332
Okay.
Yeah, great.

230
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:24,709
Thank you.
Thank you so, so much.

231
00:14:24,793 --> 00:14:25,377
What?

232
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:28,046
You guys are never
gonna believe this.

233
00:14:28,129 --> 00:14:31,048
One of the bands dropped out
of the Wango Tango auditions.

234
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:32,633
We are the first alternate.

235
00:14:32,717 --> 00:14:34,677
Shut up!

236
00:14:34,718 --> 00:14:36,220
That's awesome!

237
00:14:36,303 --> 00:14:38,680
We have to check in at
the House of Blues by 7:00.

238
00:14:38,722 --> 00:14:40,224
We're on at 7:45.

239
00:14:40,265 --> 00:14:41,850
- When is it?
- Tomorrow.

240
00:14:41,933 --> 00:14:43,476
Tomorrow?

241
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,563
Tomorrow's Friday. That's
my mom's rehearsal dinner.

242
00:14:46,646 --> 00:14:49,357
Anna, come on.
This is really important.

243
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,567
You know, don't worry.
I'll be there.

244
00:14:51,651 --> 00:14:55,196
How can you? Aren't you
the maid of horror or something?

245
00:14:55,237 --> 00:14:57,823
Honor. It's not the wedding.
It's the rehearsal.

246
00:14:57,906 --> 00:14:59,575
Don't they make a big deal
out of the rehearsal,

247
00:14:59,658 --> 00:15:01,702
like all your weird
relatives coming to town?

248
00:15:01,743 --> 00:15:03,411
No, they don't.

249
00:15:03,495 --> 00:15:06,039
There's my Anna Banana!

250
00:15:06,122 --> 00:15:08,708
Give your Grampy Doodle
a big huggy-buggy.

251
00:15:09,292 --> 00:15:11,460
Grandpa, over here.

252
00:15:13,087 --> 00:15:14,463
Oh.

253
00:15:16,131 --> 00:15:17,758
Hey, Gramps.

254
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:21,011
Don't worry.
I would never let you down.

255
00:15:21,094 --> 00:15:23,388
Just don't cancel
the audition yet.

256
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:26,224
- I'm gonna talk to my mom.
- All right.

257
00:15:26,266 --> 00:15:27,976
- We're screwed.
- Yep.

258
00:15:28,768 --> 00:15:30,269
Yeah.

259
00:15:39,862 --> 00:15:41,947
"I don't think he knows I exist.

260
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:44,741
It's stupid to think about him,
but I can't help it."

261
00:15:44,783 --> 00:15:47,410
Jake! Ooh, Jake!

262
00:15:47,452 --> 00:15:49,370
Get out of my room!

263
00:15:51,831 --> 00:15:53,874
Oh! My... my...

264
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:56,085
Ah! Aaaaah!

265
00:15:56,126 --> 00:15:57,544
She saw it.

266
00:15:57,628 --> 00:15:59,087
I'm gonna check
out those Lakers.

267
00:15:59,171 --> 00:16:00,797
I'm with you.

268
00:16:01,798 --> 00:16:03,383
Mom!

269
00:16:03,466 --> 00:16:06,010
Mom, did you see
what happened to my door?

270
00:16:10,014 --> 00:16:11,474
I spoke to your principal.

271
00:16:11,557 --> 00:16:12,099
What?

272
00:16:12,183 --> 00:16:13,684
Just now on the phone.

273
00:16:13,768 --> 00:16:14,727
Where's my door?

274
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:17,896
- Privacy is a privilege.
- Where is my door, Mom?

275
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,190
Your door will be
returned to you, Anna,

276
00:16:20,274 --> 00:16:22,692
if and when you can explain...

277
00:16:22,776 --> 00:16:25,653
You give me that door,
or I will kill myself.

278
00:16:25,695 --> 00:16:27,155
Oh!
Can I watch?

279
00:16:27,197 --> 00:16:28,656
- Harry!
- Shut up!

280
00:16:28,698 --> 00:16:30,116
Aaaaah!

281
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:33,661
I think we can dispense
with the drama.

282
00:16:33,744 --> 00:16:35,788
Maybe you can
calmly explain to me

283
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:38,373
why you were
in detention twice today.

284
00:16:38,457 --> 00:16:39,917
Okay, I went to detention.

285
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,626
That was
because Stacey Hinkhouse

286
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,670
kept hitting me
with a volleyball.

287
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:47,549
When is this conflict with
Stacey Hinkhouse going to end?

288
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:50,468
Never, because she's
an insane, psycho freak.

289
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:53,137
You'd know that if you paid
a speck of attention.

290
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:53,971
Anna!

291
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:54,847
What?

292
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,433
I think you know I pay
attention, Anna.

293
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:00,644
Enough to know that you got
an "F" in English today.

294
00:17:00,727 --> 00:17:02,604
Well, Mr. Bates
is out to get me.

295
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:03,855
Oh, him too?

296
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:05,148
Yeah.

297
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,275
He just looks
for ways to torture me.

298
00:17:07,358 --> 00:17:10,403
Like today, the one time Jake
spoke to me, he totally...

299
00:17:10,486 --> 00:17:12,321
Who's Jake?

300
00:17:12,405 --> 00:17:14,573
He's just nobody.

301
00:17:15,741 --> 00:17:18,035
You say
I'm not interested, Anna.

302
00:17:18,118 --> 00:17:21,079
I'm interested.
Try me.

303
00:17:21,872 --> 00:17:24,708
Okay, he's just this
really amazing guy, Mom.

304
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:26,459
Where'd you meet him?

305
00:17:26,543 --> 00:17:28,211
Detention, but...

306
00:17:28,294 --> 00:17:29,796
That's promising.

307
00:17:29,879 --> 00:17:31,297
Do you see? Why do I
bother telling you anything?

308
00:17:31,297 --> 00:17:32,798
Do you see? Why do I
bother telling you anything?

309
00:17:32,882 --> 00:17:35,509
Okay.
Who's up for Chinese?

310
00:17:35,593 --> 00:17:37,845
Aah!
You're ruining my life!

311
00:17:37,928 --> 00:17:42,641
I'm moving out and never coming
back ever, ever, ever again!

312
00:17:57,946 --> 00:18:00,198
- Hello. How are you?
- Hello, Pei-Pei.

313
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,702
Anna, Harry, you're so big now.
What happened?

314
00:18:03,743 --> 00:18:05,370
Are you happy for your mommy?

315
00:18:05,453 --> 00:18:06,871
About what?

316
00:18:06,913 --> 00:18:09,707
Oh. [Laughs]
She's such a joker.

317
00:18:09,749 --> 00:18:12,209
Who's catering?
Chinese food good luck.

318
00:18:12,251 --> 00:18:15,546
- It's all planned already.
- Okay, how about me?

319
00:18:15,588 --> 00:18:18,882
- I preordered the Peking duck.
- Joy.

320
00:18:18,966 --> 00:18:21,718
- I know that's your favorite.
- Whatever.

321
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,262
- The wedding is in two days.
- Think about it.

322
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:26,056
See you soon.
Happy dining.

323
00:18:26,097 --> 00:18:29,225
Anna, your door is
underneath the back stairs.

324
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:31,769
Like I didn't figure that out.

325
00:18:33,229 --> 00:18:36,065
Stop groveling, man.
Let her come to you.

326
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:38,901
She'd come with a hatchet.

327
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:41,403
I think I'll
go check on that duck.

328
00:18:45,907 --> 00:18:46,950
Anna.

329
00:18:48,409 --> 00:18:50,411
Do you think
that your surliness

330
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:53,372
is the best way for you
to get what you want?

331
00:18:57,418 --> 00:18:59,086
I'm sorry, Mom.

332
00:18:59,169 --> 00:19:01,338
I really have
been stressing in school,

333
00:19:01,421 --> 00:19:05,300
and I deserved every single one
of those trips to detention.

334
00:19:05,383 --> 00:19:09,095
And I'm gonna apologize to
Stacey Hinkhouse and Mr. Bates.

335
00:19:09,178 --> 00:19:13,182
I guess what I'm trying to say
is, I'll try and do better, Mom.

336
00:19:13,265 --> 00:19:15,351
I'll really, really try.

337
00:19:15,434 --> 00:19:17,269
All right, what do you want?

338
00:19:17,311 --> 00:19:19,188
To go to this audition tomorrow

339
00:19:19,271 --> 00:19:21,023
that we can never have
again at the House of Blues.

340
00:19:21,106 --> 00:19:22,566
An audition, that's great.

341
00:19:22,649 --> 00:19:26,403
Tomorrow? You mean
after the rehearsal dinner?

342
00:19:26,486 --> 00:19:28,905
Well, during.

343
00:19:28,988 --> 00:19:31,782
"During."
You mean as "instead of"?

344
00:19:31,866 --> 00:19:32,658
Technically?

345
00:19:32,742 --> 00:19:34,452
I need to talk to you right now.

346
00:19:34,535 --> 00:19:36,954
- I'm gonna pass on that.
- Now!

347
00:19:39,915 --> 00:19:40,666
Anna.

348
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:44,210
I am going
to make one final attempt

349
00:19:44,294 --> 00:19:46,754
to understand
what goes on in your head.

350
00:19:46,838 --> 00:19:48,631
Don't treat me like
your patients.

351
00:19:48,673 --> 00:19:50,550
- What?
- All calm and reasonable.

352
00:19:50,633 --> 00:19:52,093
Let's talk.
I want to understand.

353
00:19:52,176 --> 00:19:55,262
I really do
want to understand, Anna!

354
00:19:55,346 --> 00:19:56,138
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

355
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:59,975
Oh, Mama,
stay out of it, please.

356
00:20:00,058 --> 00:20:01,560
- Mama.
- Okay, fine.

357
00:20:01,643 --> 00:20:04,062
They're gonna pick one local
band to play at Wango Tango.

358
00:20:04,145 --> 00:20:06,356
We were lucky to make this cut.

359
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:08,983
It's a once-in-a-lifetime
chance. Please.

360
00:20:09,067 --> 00:20:10,985
Why can't I just go?
Please.

361
00:20:11,027 --> 00:20:13,362
What I hear
is that my special night

362
00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:15,406
means absolutely nothing to you.

363
00:20:15,489 --> 00:20:18,242
I don't have to ask if my band
means anything to you.

364
00:20:18,325 --> 00:20:20,494
It's clear
you think we're all noise.

365
00:20:20,535 --> 00:20:22,537
Look, I'm a walrus.

366
00:20:22,579 --> 00:20:25,832
- I do not!
- Do too!

367
00:20:25,874 --> 00:20:29,961
Anna, I let you practice
in the garage.

368
00:20:30,044 --> 00:20:31,170
Anna, stop.

369
00:20:31,212 --> 00:20:32,880
What?

370
00:20:32,964 --> 00:20:35,341
Let's talk about what
this is really about.

371
00:20:35,424 --> 00:20:37,092
This is about your dad.

372
00:20:37,176 --> 00:20:40,762
Mom, stop shrinking me.
It's not about Dad.

373
00:20:40,846 --> 00:20:43,640
It's about the audition!
You're ruining my life!

374
00:20:43,723 --> 00:20:45,433
Enough with the drama.

375
00:20:45,517 --> 00:20:47,852
Anna, high school
is not that hard.

376
00:20:47,894 --> 00:20:50,688
You couldn't last one day
in my high school.

377
00:20:50,772 --> 00:20:54,316
I could, and I would do it
without getting a detention.

378
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,528
I'm sorry I'm the one thing
in your life that isn't perfect!

379
00:20:57,611 --> 00:20:59,696
You think my life is perfect?

380
00:20:59,738 --> 00:21:01,448
I know your life is perfect.

381
00:21:01,531 --> 00:21:02,949
Your perfect job,
perfect boyfriend,

382
00:21:03,033 --> 00:21:05,368
perfect patients who worship
the ground you walk on.

383
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:08,496
You need a serious
and bracing reality check

384
00:21:08,579 --> 00:21:10,373
if you think my life is perfect!

385
00:21:10,456 --> 00:21:12,625
You can cut me some
slack this once.

386
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:15,085
I am beyond
cutting you slack, Anna.

387
00:21:15,169 --> 00:21:17,129
You are not
going to the audition.

388
00:21:17,212 --> 00:21:18,464
- I am!
- No, you're not!

389
00:21:18,547 --> 00:21:21,299
- Why not?
- Because I said so!

390
00:21:21,383 --> 00:21:23,093
Cookie?

391
00:21:26,304 --> 00:21:28,139
This isn't really a good time.

392
00:21:28,223 --> 00:21:30,058
Now a good time.

393
00:21:30,141 --> 00:21:32,393
[Speaking Chinese]

394
00:21:37,314 --> 00:21:40,609
Okay, okay.
Thank you.

395
00:21:44,821 --> 00:21:49,200
Anna, for one day,
the entirety of our life

396
00:21:49,283 --> 00:21:51,285
is not gonna be
focused on you.

397
00:21:51,369 --> 00:21:54,163
Yeah, it's all about
Ryan now, isn't it?

398
00:21:55,831 --> 00:21:56,582
Anna!

399
00:21:56,665 --> 00:21:58,125
Get away.

400
00:21:58,208 --> 00:21:59,585
Honey!

401
00:22:12,888 --> 00:22:15,099
"A journey soon begins,

402
00:22:15,182 --> 00:22:18,227
its prize reflected
in another's eyes.

403
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:20,437
When what you see
is what you lack,

404
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,773
then selfless love
will change you back."

405
00:22:23,815 --> 00:22:24,858
Whatever.

406
00:22:37,244 --> 00:22:38,537
Honey?

407
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,331
- You okay?
- Yeah.

408
00:22:41,415 --> 00:22:43,083
Whew.

409
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:44,459
Come on.

410
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:05,520
- Did you feel that?
- Feel what?

411
00:23:05,562 --> 00:23:07,814
- There was an earthquake.
- No, there wasn't.

412
00:23:07,897 --> 00:23:09,190
Yes, there was.

413
00:23:09,273 --> 00:23:10,983
What are they talking about?

414
00:23:11,025 --> 00:23:12,318
An earthquake.

415
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,277
An earthquake?

416
00:23:13,361 --> 00:23:15,654
No.
There was no earthquake.

417
00:23:15,738 --> 00:23:17,239
You didn't feel it?

418
00:23:17,323 --> 00:23:21,284
No.
I don't think so.

419
00:24:10,621 --> 00:24:12,581
6:45 already.

420
00:24:12,623 --> 00:24:15,834
Oh, God, I didn't get
the dry cleaning.

421
00:24:15,918 --> 00:24:18,754
I'll have to do that on the way
home, and call the mechanic

422
00:24:18,837 --> 00:24:20,797
and the florist.

423
00:24:21,965 --> 00:24:24,718
Okay, better get up.

424
00:24:24,759 --> 00:24:26,594
I'd better...

425
00:24:29,138 --> 00:24:32,892
Why am I in Anna's room?

426
00:24:32,933 --> 00:24:35,102
What happened last night?

427
00:24:35,186 --> 00:24:37,855
Did I pass out in here?

428
00:24:37,938 --> 00:24:40,565
Oh, I have no memory of this!

429
00:24:40,607 --> 00:24:42,609
This isn't mine!

430
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:45,987
Those aren't mine!

431
00:24:46,071 --> 00:24:47,697
That's not mine.

432
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:53,369
That's definitely not mine.

433
00:24:58,123 --> 00:25:00,626
Aaaaah!

434
00:25:00,709 --> 00:25:03,003
Anna, come here quick.

435
00:25:03,086 --> 00:25:04,421
Mom's dead.

436
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:05,797
I'm dead?

437
00:25:11,135 --> 00:25:12,928
Come on, hurry!

438
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:19,434
See?
She's not moving.

439
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,770
Oh, my God.

440
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:24,522
No, wait, it's breathing.

441
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:25,690
I'm not dead.

442
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,108
What?

443
00:25:29,485 --> 00:25:34,240
Right.
Her chest is moving, honey, see?

444
00:25:35,157 --> 00:25:37,242
You called me "honey."

445
00:25:37,326 --> 00:25:38,786
Right...

446
00:25:39,369 --> 00:25:41,121
Are you sick?

447
00:25:41,163 --> 00:25:42,581
I hope so.

448
00:25:42,664 --> 00:25:45,291
Or dreaming.

449
00:25:45,375 --> 00:25:47,001
Hon.

450
00:25:47,085 --> 00:25:49,295
Harry,
go get your own breakfast.

451
00:25:49,337 --> 00:25:51,464
You can eat Anna's cereal.

452
00:25:51,547 --> 00:25:52,506
My cereal.

453
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:53,883
Cool.

454
00:25:58,804 --> 00:26:00,430
Hello?

455
00:26:01,932 --> 00:26:04,059
Hello in there?

456
00:26:04,142 --> 00:26:06,227
Wake up, honey.

457
00:26:06,311 --> 00:26:08,187
Wake up.

458
00:26:08,271 --> 00:26:10,148
Wake up!

459
00:26:10,857 --> 00:26:11,691
That is it.

460
00:26:11,774 --> 00:26:13,567
[Groaning] Oh.

461
00:26:24,619 --> 00:26:30,083
Oh, could I just have,
like, one minute, please?

462
00:26:30,166 --> 00:26:32,168
Honey.

463
00:26:32,251 --> 00:26:35,171
Look, I think
something's happened to us.

464
00:26:35,838 --> 00:26:37,673
What are you?

465
00:26:37,715 --> 00:26:40,008
It's me. Mom.

466
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:41,510
You're not my mother.

467
00:26:41,551 --> 00:26:44,346
Yes, I am.

468
00:26:44,387 --> 00:26:46,014
Get away, you clone freak!

469
00:26:46,056 --> 00:26:49,100
Don't you use that tone with me.

470
00:26:49,183 --> 00:26:51,352
Oh, my God, you are my mother.

471
00:26:51,435 --> 00:26:54,021
And you're not
who you think you are.

472
00:27:02,612 --> 00:27:04,155
Look at me!

473
00:27:04,239 --> 00:27:05,907
We seem to be inside each other.

474
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:07,742
I'm old!

475
00:27:07,825 --> 00:27:09,452
I beg your pardon!

476
00:27:09,535 --> 00:27:12,371
Oh, I'm like the Cryptkeeper!

477
00:27:12,413 --> 00:27:14,457
Okay, that's enough.

478
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:19,503
Aah!

479
00:27:19,586 --> 00:27:21,088
I want my body back.

480
00:27:21,171 --> 00:27:24,049
And I don't want mine?
My wedding's tomorrow.

481
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:26,092
Oh, my God!
My wedding's tomorrow.

482
00:27:26,176 --> 00:27:28,428
I can't marry Ryan.
Ew!

483
00:27:28,511 --> 00:27:30,972
Okay.
Okay, okay, okay.

484
00:27:31,055 --> 00:27:32,598
Okay what?

485
00:27:32,682 --> 00:27:34,141
I have no idea.

486
00:27:34,225 --> 00:27:37,102
Mom, maybe we should go
to the emergency room.

487
00:27:37,186 --> 00:27:37,770
Oh, no.

488
00:27:37,853 --> 00:27:40,105
All that will get us
is a 72-hour lockdown

489
00:27:40,188 --> 00:27:42,441
in the psych ward
and a Thorazine drip.

490
00:27:42,524 --> 00:27:44,901
No, we're not going anywhere.

491
00:27:44,943 --> 00:27:45,819
Okay.

492
00:27:48,154 --> 00:27:51,616
So you're in my body,
and I'm in your body.

493
00:27:51,657 --> 00:27:52,908
Why don't we, like...

494
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:55,369
Yes, yes, I see
what you're saying.

495
00:27:55,452 --> 00:27:56,745
A jolt.

496
00:27:56,829 --> 00:27:59,831
Okay. You go over there,
and I go over here.

497
00:28:00,582 --> 00:28:03,043
Okay, now when I say go.
Ready?

498
00:28:03,126 --> 00:28:04,961
- Yeah.
- Go.

499
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:07,505
Hey, Mom, can I...

500
00:28:10,633 --> 00:28:13,803
Okay.
Okay, that was stupid.

501
00:28:15,054 --> 00:28:17,181
Harry!

502
00:28:17,264 --> 00:28:21,560
I was just teaching
Mom some new dance moves.

503
00:28:21,643 --> 00:28:23,562
What do you want, punk?

504
00:28:27,065 --> 00:28:29,067
You cannot talk to him
like that.

505
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,443
He thinks you're his mother.

506
00:28:30,485 --> 00:28:32,612
We're gonna to have to tell him.

507
00:28:32,653 --> 00:28:35,447
We're not going to tell anyone.

508
00:28:35,489 --> 00:28:37,825
They'll think we're crazy.

509
00:28:37,908 --> 00:28:39,535
Maybe we are crazy.

510
00:28:39,618 --> 00:28:41,161
I for one am not crazy.

511
00:28:41,244 --> 00:28:44,956
I'm merely a grown woman
trapped in my daughter's body.

512
00:28:46,541 --> 00:28:48,876
Oh, God, I am crazy.

513
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:04,683
Grandpa,
could you pass the milk?

514
00:29:04,766 --> 00:29:09,103
Okay. Harry's still Harry,
and Grandpa's still Grandpa.

515
00:29:09,187 --> 00:29:11,314
So it's just us.
What did we do wrong?

516
00:29:11,355 --> 00:29:12,231
I don't know.

517
00:29:12,315 --> 00:29:15,776
Grandpa, pass the milk!

518
00:29:15,859 --> 00:29:17,903
Grandpa, pass the milk!

519
00:29:17,986 --> 00:29:18,987
Earthquake.

520
00:29:19,071 --> 00:29:20,530
Earthquake!

521
00:29:20,614 --> 00:29:21,615
Earthquake?

522
00:29:21,698 --> 00:29:22,741
House of Chang!

523
00:29:22,824 --> 00:29:25,118
- Nobody felt it but us.
- Earthquake!

524
00:29:25,201 --> 00:29:28,329
Earthquake, earthquake!

525
00:29:28,413 --> 00:29:29,872
Honey!

526
00:29:33,084 --> 00:29:34,376
Okay.

527
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:36,045
I'll take you.

528
00:29:37,713 --> 00:29:40,507
I guess you're not ready yet.

529
00:29:43,802 --> 00:29:45,970
Sweetheart.

530
00:29:46,054 --> 00:29:47,388
What are you doing here?

531
00:29:47,472 --> 00:29:50,349
I thought you said
you needed a ride to work.

532
00:29:50,433 --> 00:29:52,893
Right, Mom.

533
00:29:52,977 --> 00:29:55,062
I guess you better hurry up.

534
00:29:55,146 --> 00:29:56,897
Get a grip.
I am not...

535
00:30:02,569 --> 00:30:04,029
Darling.

536
00:30:05,655 --> 00:30:08,449
Could you,
like, chill for a sec?

537
00:30:09,534 --> 00:30:12,995
Sure, sure, I'll chill.

538
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:16,373
- You're going.
- I'll, like, go get your dad.

539
00:30:16,457 --> 00:30:19,001
Alan, that's not our car!

540
00:30:19,084 --> 00:30:21,712
The earthquake and then
Pei-Pei's crazy mother

541
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:23,213
pointing at me and you.

542
00:30:23,255 --> 00:30:25,882
And what was she
mumbling about in Chinese?

543
00:30:25,965 --> 00:30:29,552
She did something.
Some strange Asian voodoo.

544
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:32,888
What are we gonna do now?
I can't go to school like this.

545
00:30:32,972 --> 00:30:33,889
You have to.

546
00:30:33,973 --> 00:30:35,891
You're on the verge
of suspension,

547
00:30:35,975 --> 00:30:38,936
and you have your honors
qualifying exam today.

548
00:30:39,019 --> 00:30:41,646
All the more reason
to stay home.

549
00:30:42,314 --> 00:30:45,066
I could go and
take the exam for you.

550
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:47,777
I'm sure a high test
would be simple for me.

551
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:51,405
Are you kidding?
You think you can be me?

552
00:30:51,489 --> 00:30:53,532
Of course I can.
Watch me.

553
00:30:53,616 --> 00:30:57,536
"Oh, everyone's out to get me.
You're ruining my life."

554
00:30:57,619 --> 00:30:58,912
It's easy to be you.

555
00:30:58,954 --> 00:31:00,956
I'll suck the fun
out of everything.

556
00:31:00,998 --> 00:31:02,666
I do not suck the fun
out of everything.

557
00:31:02,749 --> 00:31:04,751
- Fun sucker.
- Oh, this is ridiculous.

558
00:31:04,834 --> 00:31:08,129
I will go to school,
and you will stay right...

559
00:31:08,212 --> 00:31:09,756
- What?
- Evan.

560
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:12,633
- Evan? Who's Evan?
- My neediest patient.

561
00:31:12,717 --> 00:31:15,177
I've been seeing him every day
for three years.

562
00:31:15,261 --> 00:31:16,720
Ooh, bummer.

563
00:31:17,721 --> 00:31:20,223
Maybe just my face
would be reassuring.

564
00:31:20,307 --> 00:31:21,391
No way. Unh-unh.

565
00:31:21,475 --> 00:31:25,103
I am not babysitting
some 40-year-old wack job.

566
00:31:25,145 --> 00:31:26,813
What am I supposed
to say to the freak?

567
00:31:26,896 --> 00:31:30,525
Nothing. You are in no way
to give anyone any advice.

568
00:31:30,608 --> 00:31:31,609
That would be unethical.

569
00:31:31,692 --> 00:31:34,570
Just listen attentively,
nod occasionally,

570
00:31:34,653 --> 00:31:36,530
and if you must speak,
simply say,

571
00:31:36,614 --> 00:31:39,158
"How do you feel about that?"

572
00:31:39,241 --> 00:31:41,034
You're serious.

573
00:31:41,118 --> 00:31:43,662
You really
want us to be each other?

574
00:31:43,745 --> 00:31:46,539
We will get through
this morning as each other,

575
00:31:46,623 --> 00:31:49,459
and we will go to the restaurant
at lunch and get switched back.

576
00:31:49,542 --> 00:31:50,960
Go get dressed.

577
00:31:51,836 --> 00:31:54,672
Well, good luck getting
dressed without a door.

578
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,675
Thank you.

579
00:31:58,759 --> 00:32:00,719
[Anna screaming]

580
00:32:02,345 --> 00:32:03,763
Oh, boy.

581
00:32:03,847 --> 00:32:05,140
You'll get used to it.

582
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:06,474
What?

583
00:32:06,516 --> 00:32:08,184
You pierced your navel?

584
00:32:08,268 --> 00:32:11,270
Yeah. I meant to talk
to you about that.

585
00:32:11,354 --> 00:32:14,773
- When did you do this?
- At Maddie's cousin's sweet 16.

586
00:32:14,857 --> 00:32:18,152
Well, when you get
your body back, it's grounded.

587
00:32:18,193 --> 00:32:19,653
And what are you doing?

588
00:32:19,736 --> 00:32:22,405
I don't know why you never wear
these. They're cute.

589
00:32:22,489 --> 00:32:26,326
Yeah, if you're selling Bibles.
And what did you do to my hair?

590
00:32:26,367 --> 00:32:28,870
I've been dying
to comb these rats out.

591
00:32:28,953 --> 00:32:30,371
Now you can see
your pretty face.

592
00:32:30,455 --> 00:32:31,956
And what is this?

593
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:33,708
Oh, I fixed your jeans.

594
00:32:33,791 --> 00:32:36,543
My patients are not
going to pay $ 150 an hour

595
00:32:36,627 --> 00:32:38,837
to get therapy from a stripper.

596
00:32:38,879 --> 00:32:40,505
All right.
I'll drab up.

597
00:32:40,589 --> 00:32:41,757
I'll grunge down.

598
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,049
Go.

599
00:32:44,634 --> 00:32:46,094
What's up?

600
00:32:54,894 --> 00:32:58,772
[Radio stations switching]

601
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:02,025
Feet down.

602
00:33:02,984 --> 00:33:04,569
Harry, could you settle down?

603
00:33:04,653 --> 00:33:06,446
Bite me!

604
00:33:06,529 --> 00:33:08,656
Do you see what he
does behind your back?

605
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,032
Anna!

606
00:33:10,074 --> 00:33:11,367
Mom.

607
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:13,202
Excuse me.

608
00:33:14,286 --> 00:33:17,664
And while I'm apologizing,
let me just say to the whole car

609
00:33:17,748 --> 00:33:19,166
how truly sorry I am

610
00:33:19,249 --> 00:33:22,210
for being such an insane
control freak all the time.

611
00:33:22,252 --> 00:33:24,713
You're not controlling, Mom.

612
00:33:24,754 --> 00:33:26,840
I'm the one
who should be apologizing

613
00:33:26,923 --> 00:33:29,884
for my flagrant disregard for
anyone's feelings but my own.

614
00:33:29,926 --> 00:33:33,387
Well, at least you have
a great sense of style.

615
00:33:33,429 --> 00:33:35,472
- Not like me.
- Enough.

616
00:33:36,307 --> 00:33:37,224
Platinum, cool.

617
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:39,935
Don't even think about it.

618
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:43,230
Am I supposed to follow this?

619
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:46,816
It's nothing, darling.

620
00:33:51,862 --> 00:33:53,364
One more day.

621
00:33:57,409 --> 00:34:01,079
Yeah, it's great we're
getting married, isn't it?

622
00:34:01,163 --> 00:34:02,581
Even though my husband died.

623
00:34:02,664 --> 00:34:04,416
How quickly I've been
able to get over it.

624
00:34:04,457 --> 00:34:08,336
Just pull up here.
Mom, out of the car.

625
00:34:13,507 --> 00:34:15,593
If you manage to alienate
Ryan in my body.

626
00:34:15,676 --> 00:34:16,593
I'll be nice.

627
00:34:16,677 --> 00:34:18,095
But don't kiss him.

628
00:34:18,137 --> 00:34:20,097
Oh, Mom, I just had breakfast.

629
00:34:20,138 --> 00:34:21,765
That's disgusting.

630
00:34:21,848 --> 00:34:23,225
Nice.

631
00:34:23,308 --> 00:34:25,810
Okay. Here is the number
for the cab company.

632
00:34:25,894 --> 00:34:28,062
I want you back here
at 11:45 sharp.

633
00:34:28,146 --> 00:34:28,813
All right.

634
00:34:28,896 --> 00:34:30,815
- Do you understand?
- All right!

635
00:34:30,898 --> 00:34:34,360
What is that tone?
Are you using a tone with me?

636
00:34:36,862 --> 00:34:38,947
Oh, my God.

637
00:34:39,031 --> 00:34:39,781
Can I go?

638
00:34:39,865 --> 00:34:41,700
Why?
What are you so anxious about?

639
00:34:41,783 --> 00:34:43,076
Hey, Anna.

640
00:34:44,536 --> 00:34:46,454
Do you know him?

641
00:34:48,289 --> 00:34:49,791
Kinda.
That's Jake.

642
00:34:49,874 --> 00:34:53,294
- No, no.
- You gotta give him a chance.

643
00:34:53,336 --> 00:34:56,005
That is the last thing
I'm going to give him.

644
00:34:56,088 --> 00:34:59,967
- You don't even know him.
- I know he's too old for you.

645
00:35:01,218 --> 00:35:03,053
My God, he's coming over.
Say hi.

646
00:35:03,136 --> 00:35:05,221
Say hi back,
or I break up with Ryan.

647
00:35:05,305 --> 00:35:07,765
- Hi, Jake.
- Hey.

648
00:35:09,976 --> 00:35:11,102
So.

649
00:35:11,185 --> 00:35:15,231
Oh, this is my mother,
Dr. Coleman.

650
00:35:16,607 --> 00:35:17,316
Hi.

651
00:35:17,399 --> 00:35:18,775
Hi.

652
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:25,323
- It's a great bike.
- What?

653
00:35:25,407 --> 00:35:28,826
Not like I've ever been on it.
I'm not allowed.

654
00:35:29,952 --> 00:35:33,039
I mean I'm allowed
because I'm old.

655
00:35:35,374 --> 00:35:36,500
I gotta go.

656
00:35:36,542 --> 00:35:38,377
Bye.

657
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,254
Walk with him.

658
00:35:46,551 --> 00:35:49,721
Harry, do you know who that is?

659
00:35:49,804 --> 00:35:51,806
Anna's got a boyfriend.

660
00:35:51,889 --> 00:35:54,850
K-l-S-S-l-N-G.

661
00:35:55,434 --> 00:35:58,562
Okay, where are we going next?
Harry's school?

662
00:36:00,314 --> 00:36:02,023
Oh, he can walk from here.

663
00:36:02,065 --> 00:36:04,109
It's 20 blocks!

664
00:36:04,192 --> 00:36:05,693
Fresh air will do you good.

665
00:36:05,777 --> 00:36:07,487
What about bullies?

666
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:08,571
Run fast.

667
00:36:08,655 --> 00:36:12,241
Tess, look, really, it's
no trouble to drive him.

668
00:36:12,992 --> 00:36:13,951
Whatever.

669
00:36:22,417 --> 00:36:25,170
Hey, I've got The Hives for you.

670
00:36:25,253 --> 00:36:26,880
I beg your pardon?

671
00:36:26,963 --> 00:36:29,340
- The CD.
- Oh, yeah, that.

672
00:36:29,424 --> 00:36:31,050
They're coming
to town next week.

673
00:36:31,092 --> 00:36:33,219
- I was wondering if...
- That's a nice thought.

674
00:36:33,302 --> 00:36:35,846
I'm sure with a haircut
you'd look presentable.

675
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:37,723
But I need to focus
on my schoolwork,

676
00:36:37,765 --> 00:36:40,309
and truth be told,
you're way too old for me.

677
00:36:40,392 --> 00:36:42,602
But thanks anyway, Jason.

678
00:36:44,437 --> 00:36:45,855
It's Jake.

679
00:36:49,817 --> 00:36:51,986
Hello.
Good morning.

680
00:36:52,069 --> 00:36:53,738
Good morning.
Hi.

681
00:36:53,779 --> 00:36:54,905
Hello.

682
00:36:56,824 --> 00:36:59,117
Stacey!
Hi, how are you?

683
00:36:59,201 --> 00:37:01,078
Oh, wonderful.

684
00:37:03,538 --> 00:37:06,124
Stacey, what are you doing?

685
00:37:10,169 --> 00:37:11,921
Run away.

686
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:15,216
- Are you okay, Anna?
- God!

687
00:37:15,299 --> 00:37:18,135
I am appalled Stacey
would do something like that.

688
00:37:18,218 --> 00:37:19,219
Yeah, shocker.

689
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:22,139
Oh, I am going
to be calling her mother.

690
00:37:22,222 --> 00:37:24,933
Forget about that.
We'll get her later.

691
00:37:24,975 --> 00:37:25,809
We saw you.

692
00:37:25,892 --> 00:37:27,518
- Saw me what?
- With Jake.

693
00:37:27,602 --> 00:37:29,854
- Give us the dirty details.
- Excuse me?

694
00:37:29,937 --> 00:37:30,980
Did you make a move?

695
00:37:31,063 --> 00:37:34,900
- Is that something I would do?
- It's something you should do.

696
00:37:34,984 --> 00:37:36,318
No, no, no.

697
00:37:36,402 --> 00:37:38,779
I don't believe
in physical contact

698
00:37:38,821 --> 00:37:41,531
with the opposite sex
at all, ever.

699
00:37:41,615 --> 00:37:42,532
Nothing.

700
00:37:42,616 --> 00:37:46,035
And you girls would do
well to follow my example.

701
00:37:58,338 --> 00:37:59,548
Well.

702
00:37:59,631 --> 00:38:02,050
- Whoa, whoa!
- What?

703
00:38:02,134 --> 00:38:03,677
Cold sore, cold sore.

704
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,762
- Where?
- I feel it coming on there.

705
00:38:05,845 --> 00:38:07,305
- Big oozer.
- I don't care.

706
00:38:07,347 --> 00:38:09,599
I'm thinking of you, really.

707
00:38:09,682 --> 00:38:10,892
You.

708
00:38:10,975 --> 00:38:13,686
Okay. Okay.

709
00:38:13,769 --> 00:38:16,146
Good thing, I guess.

710
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:19,566
You need a ride home, or are you
gonna pick up the Volvo?

711
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:23,987
Oh, I will most definitely
be picking up the Volvo.

712
00:39:17,953 --> 00:39:20,580
Ow!

713
00:39:32,967 --> 00:39:34,718
Hey. How's it going?

714
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:37,596
- Uh! What?

715
00:40:00,826 --> 00:40:02,369
Dr. Coleman's office.

716
00:40:02,452 --> 00:40:04,162
Hi.
This is Dr. Dunn's office.

717
00:40:04,245 --> 00:40:06,748
I am calling to confirm
your root canal appointment.

718
00:40:06,831 --> 00:40:07,749
Root canal?

719
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:09,917
That's not fair!
They're not my teeth.

720
00:40:10,001 --> 00:40:12,128
Okay, I'm not sure...

721
00:40:12,211 --> 00:40:14,755
No.
No, I'm cutting the dentist.

722
00:40:14,839 --> 00:40:17,257
- You mean you're canceling?
- Yeah, cancel.

723
00:40:17,341 --> 00:40:20,302
Like I'm going to take
that bullet. Please!

724
00:40:24,306 --> 00:40:25,598
Evan.

725
00:40:25,682 --> 00:40:28,768
No. Boris.

726
00:40:28,851 --> 00:40:29,977
Line 27.

727
00:40:30,645 --> 00:40:32,104
- Thanks.
- There you go.

728
00:40:35,107 --> 00:40:38,318
Whoa!
She's blind!

729
00:40:38,402 --> 00:40:40,779
Oh, this sucks.

730
00:40:40,821 --> 00:40:41,822
Wanna get that?

731
00:40:41,905 --> 00:40:45,533
No way. I'm not answering
that thing again.

732
00:40:45,617 --> 00:40:46,534
Good to see you.

733
00:40:46,618 --> 00:40:47,869
Okay.

734
00:40:51,747 --> 00:40:53,207
You're here.

735
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:57,252
Oh.
Yeah, I'm here, and you're here.

736
00:40:57,336 --> 00:40:58,795
You look fantastic.

737
00:40:58,837 --> 00:41:00,464
Why?
Are you canceling the session?

738
00:41:00,547 --> 00:41:01,465
No, Kevin.

739
00:41:01,506 --> 00:41:02,340
Evan!

740
00:41:02,424 --> 00:41:04,634
Evan. Evan.

741
00:41:04,718 --> 00:41:07,512
So, shall we go in here
and do it?

742
00:41:07,595 --> 00:41:10,306
Are you gonna get that?

743
00:41:10,348 --> 00:41:11,724
No.

744
00:41:11,807 --> 00:41:14,310
Oh, so you
don't answer your phone.

745
00:41:14,393 --> 00:41:17,271
I told you I wouldn't be able
to call you on your honeymoon,

746
00:41:17,354 --> 00:41:18,814
but you lied to me.

747
00:41:18,897 --> 00:41:20,315
You're a liar!

748
00:41:20,399 --> 00:41:21,441
I'll get it.

749
00:41:22,526 --> 00:41:23,526
Yo.

750
00:41:25,028 --> 00:41:26,154
What?

751
00:41:26,905 --> 00:41:29,615
$ 10,000? For what?

752
00:41:29,699 --> 00:41:31,909
Halibut!
Ew!

753
00:41:31,993 --> 00:41:34,328
What kind of caterer are you?

754
00:41:34,411 --> 00:41:36,664
It's disgusting.

755
00:41:36,747 --> 00:41:39,291
Well, I'm not gonna pay for it.

756
00:41:39,374 --> 00:41:42,669
Okay, fine. Don't show up.
See if I care.

757
00:41:42,711 --> 00:41:45,046
Yeah, I'm canceling.

758
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:47,882
Yeah, well, same to you, dude.

759
00:41:48,591 --> 00:41:49,509
So, Ethan.

760
00:41:49,592 --> 00:41:50,510
Evan!

761
00:41:50,593 --> 00:41:52,928
Evan.
I knew that.

762
00:42:00,686 --> 00:42:04,147
Bates. I've seen him before.
Where have I seen him before?

763
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:07,192
Like, every day
in this torture chamber.

764
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:09,068
So, did you talk to your mom?

765
00:42:09,152 --> 00:42:14,031
Today is a lovely day
for a pop quiz.

766
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:19,244
All of you should have finished
reading "Hamlet" by now.

767
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:21,913
I'm going to ask each
one of you one question,

768
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:25,000
and you will be graded
according to your answer.

769
00:42:25,083 --> 00:42:28,961
Oh, thank God it's "Hamlet."
I was in that play in high...

770
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:31,756
I just know the play.

771
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:33,090
Like that'll help you.

772
00:42:33,174 --> 00:42:37,428
Mr. Waters, describe
the character of Hamlet.

773
00:42:42,099 --> 00:42:43,558
Hamlet.

774
00:42:43,642 --> 00:42:47,103
He's, uh...
he's one of the big characters.

775
00:42:47,145 --> 00:42:48,730
I mean, he's Hamlet.

776
00:42:50,314 --> 00:42:55,986
He's just bopping around,
doesn't know which way's up.

777
00:42:57,571 --> 00:43:01,074
I don't think
the guy's got a clue.

778
00:43:01,158 --> 00:43:05,370
You mean to say
that he is a man...

779
00:43:05,453 --> 00:43:06,121
Yeah.

780
00:43:06,204 --> 00:43:10,541
Who couldn't make up his...

781
00:43:10,625 --> 00:43:12,793
- mind.
- Mind.

782
00:43:12,877 --> 00:43:14,295
Exactly.

783
00:43:14,378 --> 00:43:14,962
Very good.

784
00:43:15,045 --> 00:43:16,297
All right.

785
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:18,298
- "B."
- Yeah.

786
00:43:21,051 --> 00:43:22,260
Ms. Coleman.

787
00:43:22,344 --> 00:43:23,428
Yes, Mr. Bates?

788
00:43:23,511 --> 00:43:27,098
What are the central
conflicts in "Hamlet"?

789
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:29,183
Well, political, of course,

790
00:43:29,267 --> 00:43:31,435
because Claudius usurped
his father's throne.

791
00:43:31,477 --> 00:43:34,438
Oedipal, because of the
undercurrents with his mother.

792
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,774
Then there is the timeless
question of insanity.

793
00:43:36,857 --> 00:43:42,487
Is he really seeing his father's
ghost, or is he simply mad?

794
00:43:42,571 --> 00:43:47,575
That is seriously overreaching.

795
00:43:47,659 --> 00:43:48,534
"F."

796
00:43:48,618 --> 00:43:50,369
- "F"?
- "F."

797
00:43:50,453 --> 00:43:53,581
Mr. Franelli, who is Fortinbras?

798
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:55,624
I started reading your new book,

799
00:43:55,708 --> 00:43:59,962
and it just makes me feel
really depressed.

800
00:44:02,214 --> 00:44:04,466
And how do you feel about that?

801
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,135
Depressed.

802
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:10,805
[Mumbling incoherently]

803
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:21,481
And how do you feel about that?

804
00:44:26,694 --> 00:44:29,697
She and her best friend
aren't speaking, Doctor.

805
00:44:29,781 --> 00:44:33,284
And in her diary,
she keeps mentioning this boy.

806
00:44:33,367 --> 00:44:35,077
How do you feel about that?

807
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,120
Well, I'm worried.

808
00:44:36,203 --> 00:44:37,996
You read her diaries?

809
00:44:38,038 --> 00:44:40,165
Oh, that's gross!

810
00:44:40,248 --> 00:44:42,667
That's bad.
"Bad Mom" award.

811
00:44:42,709 --> 00:44:46,713
But I'm concerned, Doctor,
that she and this boy might be,

812
00:44:46,796 --> 00:44:48,172
I mean, you know.

813
00:44:48,256 --> 00:44:50,091
Stop! Stop!

814
00:44:50,174 --> 00:44:52,677
Nothing is going on
between her and this guy.

815
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:55,554
If there was, she wouldn't be
writing about it.

816
00:44:55,638 --> 00:44:57,222
She'd be out there doing it.

817
00:44:57,347 --> 00:44:59,600
Her best friend
probably isn't talking to her

818
00:44:59,641 --> 00:45:01,643
because she probably
likes this guy, too.

819
00:45:01,727 --> 00:45:04,104
And he probably flirted
with her a little,

820
00:45:04,187 --> 00:45:05,397
but he secretly
likes your daughter.

821
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,982
He hasn't made his move yet
because that wouldn't be cool.

822
00:45:08,066 --> 00:45:11,694
So now her best friend is
acting like some psycho freak.

823
00:45:11,777 --> 00:45:12,903
Okay?

824
00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:16,365
That's very interesting.

825
00:45:16,407 --> 00:45:18,659
I never would have
thought about it that way.

826
00:45:18,742 --> 00:45:20,661
Cool.
Guess we're done.

827
00:45:28,167 --> 00:45:30,586
Mr. Bates, may I please
speak with you?

828
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:34,090
I think that would be fairly
pointless, but go ahead.

829
00:45:34,173 --> 00:45:37,676
By what stretch
of the imagination...

830
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:41,263
I mean, like, how could I,
like, get an "F"?

831
00:45:41,346 --> 00:45:42,722
What mistakes did I make?

832
00:45:42,806 --> 00:45:44,557
Grading is subjective.

833
00:45:44,641 --> 00:45:46,476
That was
a college-level analysis.

834
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:49,896
And you're qualified
to make that assessment?

835
00:45:49,937 --> 00:45:51,147
I most certainly am.

836
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:55,609
Well, in the words of Hamlet,
"What's done is done."

837
00:45:55,693 --> 00:45:59,196
That's "Macbeth,"
you know-nothing twit.

838
00:45:59,321 --> 00:46:01,490
Bates.
Elton Bates.

839
00:46:01,531 --> 00:46:03,033
Griffith High School.

840
00:46:03,116 --> 00:46:04,743
How do you know that?

841
00:46:04,784 --> 00:46:07,829
Well, you asked me,
I mean, my mom to the prom,

842
00:46:07,912 --> 00:46:09,664
but she turned you down.

843
00:46:09,747 --> 00:46:11,749
This is not
an appropriate subject.

844
00:46:11,832 --> 00:46:14,251
You're taking it out
on her daughter, aren't you?

845
00:46:14,293 --> 00:46:15,920
I don't know
what you're talking about.

846
00:46:16,003 --> 00:46:17,755
It was a high school dance.

847
00:46:17,796 --> 00:46:20,257
You've got to let it
go and move on, man.

848
00:46:20,299 --> 00:46:23,843
And if you don't, I'm sure the
school board would love to hear

849
00:46:23,927 --> 00:46:28,139
about your pathetic vendetta
against an innocent student.

850
00:46:28,222 --> 00:46:30,224
Oh, and by the way, Elton,

851
00:46:30,308 --> 00:46:34,395
she had a boyfriend,
and you were weird.

852
00:46:36,272 --> 00:46:39,775
That was amazing.
You totally destroyed him.

853
00:46:39,858 --> 00:46:42,611
I don't think Elton Bates
will be giving me much trouble.

854
00:46:42,694 --> 00:46:44,154
That's so weird about your mom.

855
00:46:44,237 --> 00:46:46,322
- Oh, yeah, what did she say?
- About what?

856
00:46:46,406 --> 00:46:49,409
- About the audition.
- Oh, right. She said no.

857
00:46:49,492 --> 00:46:51,035
What?

858
00:46:51,827 --> 00:46:53,662
Well, it is
her rehearsal dinner.

859
00:46:53,746 --> 00:46:56,498
Don't you think
that's rather important, too?

860
00:46:56,582 --> 00:46:57,958
And you told her?

861
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,335
You told her this chance
would never come again?

862
00:47:00,419 --> 00:47:02,879
- She sympathizes.
- Don't give us this.

863
00:47:02,963 --> 00:47:04,839
She is totally
ruining our lives.

864
00:47:04,923 --> 00:47:06,257
You're the culprit.

865
00:47:06,341 --> 00:47:09,135
Yeah, your mom
has never cared about our music.

866
00:47:09,177 --> 00:47:10,178
Never cared?

867
00:47:10,261 --> 00:47:11,262
Never cared?

868
00:47:11,345 --> 00:47:13,389
Who do you think paid
for those guitar lessons?

869
00:47:13,472 --> 00:47:16,183
And did she ever hear
a "thank you"? No.

870
00:47:16,267 --> 00:47:17,810
Come on, you said it yourself.

871
00:47:17,893 --> 00:47:19,853
Your mom hasn't paid
attention to you

872
00:47:19,937 --> 00:47:22,105
since she started
dating that guy.

873
00:47:22,189 --> 00:47:23,106
That's not true.

874
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:24,941
Well, you talk about it enough.

875
00:47:25,025 --> 00:47:25,984
I do?

876
00:47:26,067 --> 00:47:28,069
What is up with you today?

877
00:47:28,152 --> 00:47:30,988
You act like you don't even
care about this band.

878
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:34,700
Look, girls... guys,
if it were any other night.

879
00:47:34,783 --> 00:47:37,202
Whatever, Anna.

880
00:47:40,747 --> 00:47:42,124
God.

881

884
00:48:03,101 --> 00:48:04,853
- You picked up my car!
- Yeah.

885
00:48:04,936 --> 00:48:07,105
Get out of the car.
I'm driving.

886
00:48:07,188 --> 00:48:09,357
Oh, my God.
What have you done to me?

887
00:48:09,399 --> 00:48:10,608
Do you like it?

888
00:48:10,691 --> 00:48:13,527
Get out of the car right now!

889
00:48:13,611 --> 00:48:14,862
Do you have your permit?

890
00:48:14,945 --> 00:48:16,739
No.

00:48:22,202 --> 00:48:24,245
My hair.
It's gone!

892
00:48:24,329 --> 00:48:25,830
What have you done to my ear?

893
00:48:25,914 --> 00:48:27,373
Mom, it's an earring!

894
00:48:27,415 --> 00:48:28,916
Take it out right now!

895
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,501
No.
It looks cool.

896
00:48:30,585 --> 00:48:31,711
Don't start with me.

897
00:48:31,752 --> 00:48:34,004
Those clothes
are going back tomorrow!

898
00:48:34,088 --> 00:48:36,090
Why? Everyone likes them.
You look great.

899
00:48:36,173 --> 00:48:38,175
I look like Stevie Nicks.

900
00:48:38,258 --> 00:48:39,968
Who's he?

901
00:48:40,052 --> 00:48:42,721
- What are you doing with this?
- I'm eating.

902
00:48:42,762 --> 00:48:44,222
You cannot eat fast food.

903
00:48:44,264 --> 00:48:44,848
Why not?

904
00:48:44,931 --> 00:48:46,766
Because it will
go down your throat

905
00:48:46,850 --> 00:48:49,519
and drop instantly to my thighs.

906
00:48:49,602 --> 00:48:51,229
- Oh, come on.
- Watch the road.

907
00:48:53,564 --> 00:48:56,608
Oh, this food may make
you blow up like a balloon,

908
00:48:56,692 --> 00:48:58,986
but it will do nothing
whatsoever to me.

909
00:48:59,069 --> 00:49:01,113
Oh, Mom!

910
00:49:03,281 --> 00:49:04,783
Oh, God, this is good.

911
00:49:04,866 --> 00:49:06,367
Mom, that's not fair.

912
00:49:06,451 --> 00:49:09,078
My first french fry
in eight years.

913
00:49:09,162 --> 00:49:11,956
I can hear
the "Hallelujah Chorus."

914
00:49:13,624 --> 00:49:15,417
Road!

915
00:49:20,505 --> 00:49:24,009
Oh, hi, hi.
You back so soon.

916
00:49:24,092 --> 00:49:26,177
Sexy new look for you,
Mrs. Coleman.

917
00:49:26,261 --> 00:49:27,178
You look hot.

918
00:49:27,262 --> 00:49:29,013
- Two for lunch?
- No, Pei-Pei.

919
00:49:29,097 --> 00:49:30,389
We'd like to speak
to you about something

920
00:49:30,473 --> 00:49:32,433
we think happened
to us at your restaurant.

921
00:49:32,475 --> 00:49:34,810
- Something that sucks.
- Let me handle this.

922
00:49:34,894 --> 00:49:36,186
Okay.

923
00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:40,565
When we woke up this morning,
we weren't ourselves.

924
00:49:40,649 --> 00:49:41,942
Yeah.

925
00:49:41,983 --> 00:49:44,778
Oh. Mama!

926
00:49:49,365 --> 00:49:52,576
Hey, hey!
You come back here.

927
00:49:56,664 --> 00:49:58,457
Hello, hello.

928
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:00,083
Did you give them
the fortune cookie?

929
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:09,717
What did she say?

930
00:50:09,801 --> 00:50:11,636
Oh.
She's crazy.

931
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:25,315
Well?

932
00:50:25,398 --> 00:50:28,067
She don't know what
you're talking about.

933
00:50:28,151 --> 00:50:30,236
Okay, let's have lunch.
Let's eat.

934
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:32,071
You know exactly
what we're talking about.

935
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:33,322
Let's hit her.

936
00:50:33,364 --> 00:50:35,950
Okay, okay.

937
00:50:37,368 --> 00:50:39,786
I cannot fix it.
Only you can fix it.

938
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:42,664
When the fortune come true,
then you go back.

939
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:43,707
What fortune?

940
00:50:43,748 --> 00:50:46,209
From the fortune cookie.

941
00:50:46,292 --> 00:50:48,544
You find the answer
in each other.

942
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:51,631
When the fortune come true,
then you go back, okay?

943
00:50:51,714 --> 00:50:53,507
No big deal.

944
00:50:54,091 --> 00:50:56,385
You mean, we're stuck
in this suck-fest?

945
00:50:56,468 --> 00:50:58,679
You're not going to do anything?

946
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,263
How about 10% off catering?

947
00:51:00,347 --> 00:51:02,807
No, Pei-Pei, we have a caterer.

948
00:51:02,891 --> 00:51:06,686
Actually, Mom, there's something
I forgot to tell you.

949
00:51:06,769 --> 00:51:11,274
Okay, good idea, how about I do?

950
00:51:12,775 --> 00:51:15,486
- What did that fortune say?
- Like I remember?

951
00:51:15,569 --> 00:51:18,363
- I don't remember, either.
- Oh, I hate this!

952
00:51:18,447 --> 00:51:20,699
I don't wanna get married at 15!

953
00:51:20,782 --> 00:51:22,534
It's not even legal!

954
00:51:22,576 --> 00:51:25,245
I want my room back.
I want my friends.

955
00:51:25,328 --> 00:51:27,705
I want to eat whatever
I want when I want.

956
00:51:27,747 --> 00:51:28,956
Mommy.

957
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,709
I know, sweetie.
It's a hard day.

958
00:51:31,751 --> 00:51:33,044
We'll get through it.

959
00:51:33,127 --> 00:51:34,837
Breathe.
Deep breath.

960
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:36,880
We'll go home
and find the fortune.

961
00:51:36,964 --> 00:51:39,216
[Cellphone ringing,
beeping]

962
00:51:39,299 --> 00:51:41,259
- Make it stop!
- Oh, my organizer.

963
00:51:41,343 --> 00:51:43,386
It's been going off all day.

964
00:51:46,097 --> 00:51:47,682
Parent-teacher conference!

965
00:51:47,765 --> 00:51:48,891
I completely forgot!

966
00:51:48,975 --> 00:51:50,852
You have to be at Harry's
school in 15 minutes.

967
00:51:50,935 --> 00:51:51,936
No!
I hate teachers!

968
00:51:52,019 --> 00:51:54,271
You have to go.
I'll go to your school.

969
00:51:54,355 --> 00:51:57,483
I'll take your exam,
and everything will be okay.

970
00:51:57,566 --> 00:51:59,318
Okay, let's go.

971
00:52:06,157 --> 00:52:07,242
Mom?

972
00:52:07,325 --> 00:52:09,077
Yeah. Whatever.

973
00:52:10,786 --> 00:52:12,496
Mrs. Coleman.

974
00:52:13,748 --> 00:52:16,208
All right, let's do this thing.

975
00:52:16,875 --> 00:52:18,127
Okay.

976
00:52:18,210 --> 00:52:21,338
Well, what can I say
about Harry?

977
00:52:21,421 --> 00:52:23,298
He is a sweet boy.

978
00:52:23,381 --> 00:52:27,218
But he's having a little
trouble with bullies.

979
00:52:27,302 --> 00:52:28,761
So?

980
00:52:28,845 --> 00:52:31,722
That's character-building.
Kid needs to toughen up.

981
00:52:31,806 --> 00:52:34,266
He's kind of a wimp.

982
00:52:34,308 --> 00:52:36,268
So, that's it?
I can go?

983
00:52:36,310 --> 00:52:38,896
No, not exactly.

984
00:52:38,979 --> 00:52:40,397
Harry's very bright,

985
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,983
but he's having a
problem applying himself,

986
00:52:43,066 --> 00:52:44,317
particularly in Math.

987
00:52:44,401 --> 00:52:45,610
So, hold him back.

988
00:52:45,652 --> 00:52:47,195
I mean, he's short.

989
00:52:47,278 --> 00:52:49,489
He'll fit in,
you know what I mean?

990
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:53,743
Well, you know,
he's very good in English.

991
00:52:53,826 --> 00:52:56,870
I had the class write an essay
on who they admire most,

992
00:52:56,954 --> 00:53:01,124
and he wrote a wonderful
paper about your daughter.

993
00:53:21,393 --> 00:53:23,436
So, what'd she say?

994
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,855
She showed me the paper
you wrote about Anna.

995
00:53:25,939 --> 00:53:27,815
- You saw that?
- Mm-hmm.

996
00:53:27,857 --> 00:53:29,984
Well, don't tell her I like her.

997
00:53:30,067 --> 00:53:31,068
Well, why not?

998
00:53:31,152 --> 00:53:34,238
Because we have
too much fun fighting.

999
00:53:38,325 --> 00:53:42,704
You know, kid, you are way more
twisted than I thought.

1000
00:53:46,916 --> 00:53:48,251
Good try!

1001
00:53:48,334 --> 00:53:49,710
- Oh, man!
- Loser!

1002
00:53:51,754 --> 00:53:53,381
Good luck flunking.

1003
00:53:54,215 --> 00:53:57,509
Stacey, I want to talk to you.
Come here.

1004
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:00,512
Why this falling out?

1005
00:54:00,554 --> 00:54:02,848
We were best friends
in sixth grade.

1006
00:54:02,889 --> 00:54:04,933
I know I got
involved with my music,

1007
00:54:05,016 --> 00:54:06,935
and you became involved
with your cheerleading,

1008
00:54:07,018 --> 00:54:09,228
but why does this
have to be World War III?

1009
00:54:09,312 --> 00:54:10,188
All those years

1010
00:54:10,271 --> 00:54:13,024
of trick-or-treating
and sleepovers.

1011
00:54:13,107 --> 00:54:15,859
Don't you remember any of it?
I know I do.

1012
00:54:15,901 --> 00:54:18,862
I mean, how do you
feel about that?

1013
00:54:18,904 --> 00:54:22,699
All right, let's all
take our seats for the test.

1014
00:54:23,742 --> 00:54:25,869
Sit with me?

1015
00:54:25,910 --> 00:54:28,621
Communication.
That's all it takes.

1016
00:54:30,623 --> 00:54:32,875
Hey, there you are.

1017
00:54:32,958 --> 00:54:34,210
Ooh! You again.

1018
00:54:34,251 --> 00:54:36,086
Look at you.

1019
00:54:36,170 --> 00:54:38,672
Love the hair.

1020
00:54:38,755 --> 00:54:41,258
Got a surprise.
You're gonna be happy with me.

1021
00:54:41,341 --> 00:54:42,634
I seriously doubt that.

1022
00:54:42,717 --> 00:54:44,594
Great dress. Sexy.

1023
00:54:44,678 --> 00:54:45,929
Oozing sore!

1024
00:54:46,012 --> 00:54:47,388
I don't see anything.

1025
00:54:48,765 --> 00:54:49,891
Makeup! Great stuff!

1026
00:54:49,974 --> 00:54:53,185
Hey, take it easy, stud.
Save it for the honeymoon.

1027
00:54:53,269 --> 00:54:55,854
You know what?
We have to go anyway.

1028
00:54:55,938 --> 00:54:58,565
Oh, no, I have to get
that fortune thingy.

1029
00:54:58,607 --> 00:55:00,484
No time.
I've got my sweater on.

1030
00:55:00,567 --> 00:55:02,110
No, no.
I have to...

1031
00:55:02,194 --> 00:55:04,696
We have to leave.
We'll spoil the surprise.

1032
00:55:04,779 --> 00:55:04,863
- Watch your step.
- Okay.

1033
00:55:04,863 --> 00:55:06,072
- Watch your step.
- Okay.

1034
00:55:06,156 --> 00:55:07,574
- Watch your step.
- Okay!

1035
00:55:07,615 --> 00:55:10,409
- Still got your eyes closed?
- Yeah.

1036
00:55:10,493 --> 00:55:13,162
All right, okay, relax.
Open them.

1037
00:55:14,705 --> 00:55:16,415
You're on
"The Dottie Robertson Show."

1038
00:55:16,498 --> 00:55:19,042
They had
a last-second cancellation.

1039
00:55:19,126 --> 00:55:20,711
I got you on.

1040
00:55:20,794 --> 00:55:22,129
To talk about that book?

1041
00:55:22,212 --> 00:55:23,505
Break a leg.

1042
00:55:23,588 --> 00:55:25,090
I didn't want to say anything.

1043
00:55:25,173 --> 00:55:26,633
We're ready for you now.

1044
00:55:26,716 --> 00:55:28,426
I know you get nervous,
but you're gonna be great.

1045
00:55:28,468 --> 00:55:30,261
I'm gonna barf!

1046
00:55:30,344 --> 00:55:31,679
Go get 'em!

1047
00:55:32,388 --> 00:55:35,140
- Watch your step. This way.
- I'm sorry.

1048
00:55:35,224 --> 00:55:37,559
- I'm not that person.
- Right there.

1049
00:55:37,643 --> 00:55:39,478
There you go.
Oh, sorry.

1050
00:55:39,561 --> 00:55:43,440
Now, makeup's gonna
come to you, sweetie, okay?

1051
00:55:43,481 --> 00:55:44,482
What is this thing?

1052
00:55:44,524 --> 00:55:47,235
"Through the Looking Glass.
Senescence."

1053
00:55:47,318 --> 00:55:50,571
Se-nes-cence?
Seeny-sincey?

1054
00:55:50,655 --> 00:55:52,281
What?

1055
00:55:54,909 --> 00:55:56,994
"The sum of
the areas of the shaded regions

1056
00:55:57,077 --> 00:55:59,997
in terms of 'D' is equal to
A, 'D' squared times the sum

1057
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:02,999
of pi divided by four minus
'D' divided by two.

1058
00:56:03,083 --> 00:56:05,752
B, 'D' squared
times the sum of pi cubed

1059
00:56:05,835 --> 00:56:07,420
divided by 'D' minus two."

1060
00:56:07,503 --> 00:56:10,381
Now, what is pi again?
Three-point-something?

1061
00:56:10,465 --> 00:56:12,967
Oh, this is ridiculous.
I've never used pi.

1062
00:56:13,050 --> 00:56:16,553
Anna's never gonna use pi!
Why is it called pi anyway?

1063
00:56:16,637 --> 00:56:18,263
Okay, focus.

1064
00:56:18,347 --> 00:56:21,683
Or "C, 'D' cubed minus
the sum of pi squared.

1065
00:56:21,767 --> 00:56:23,059
Psst!

1066
00:56:28,231 --> 00:56:31,150
Miss Brown,
she's copying my test!

1067
00:56:58,217 --> 00:57:00,844
- Hey, cheater.
- I did not cheat.

1068
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:02,929
That Stacey Hinkhouse
is conniving.

1069
00:57:03,013 --> 00:57:04,306
It's your business.

1070
00:57:04,389 --> 00:57:07,725
I did not cheat.
Don't you smirk at me.

1071
00:57:07,809 --> 00:57:08,726
If you're so perfect,

1072
00:57:08,810 --> 00:57:10,561
why are you
in detention all the time?

1073
00:57:10,645 --> 00:57:13,814
I'm not in detention.
I work here.

1074
00:57:16,233 --> 00:57:19,570
What would you say if I told you
I could help finish your test?

1075
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:21,696
Really?

1076
00:57:22,531 --> 00:57:23,949
Yeah.

1077
00:57:24,032 --> 00:57:27,285
You know, my publisher doesn't
think anybody's gonna know

1078
00:57:27,368 --> 00:57:29,829
what the word
"senescence" means.

1079
00:57:29,912 --> 00:57:31,122
Do you know what it means?

1080
00:57:31,205 --> 00:57:32,832
No.
Please do sit still.

1081
00:57:32,915 --> 00:57:34,375
Okay.

1082
00:57:37,169 --> 00:57:40,630
All right, they keep
the tests in the file room.

1083
00:57:40,714 --> 00:57:42,799
We're going through here?

1084
00:57:42,883 --> 00:57:46,761
They're so burned out
they won't notice. Trust me.

1085
00:58:12,451 --> 00:58:15,371
All right, all right, all right.
Coleman.

1086
00:58:17,331 --> 00:58:18,373
Anna Coleman.

1087
00:58:18,457 --> 00:58:20,625
Oh, my gosh, thank you.

1088
00:58:21,626 --> 00:58:23,795
Now hurry up
and finish your test.

1089
00:58:23,878 --> 00:58:26,881
You really are something, Jake.

1090
00:58:26,965 --> 00:58:28,466
I'll watch the door.

1091
00:58:29,592 --> 00:58:31,427
Back from commercial in 10.

1092
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:35,014
Loved your book.
I actually read this one.

1093
00:58:35,848 --> 00:58:37,391
That makes one of us.

1094
00:58:38,308 --> 00:58:42,104
Ready and three, two.

1095
00:58:43,146 --> 00:58:44,147
Hi. Welcome back.

1096
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:46,065
We're here with
Dr. Tess Coleman,

1097
00:58:46,149 --> 00:58:48,318
author of
"Through the Looking Glass,

1098
00:58:48,401 --> 00:58:50,361
Senescence in Retrograde."

1099
00:58:50,444 --> 00:58:53,489
So, Doctor, tell us
about your new book.

1100
00:58:57,659 --> 00:58:58,952
Well.

1101
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:02,372
I wrote it.

1102
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:05,041
Yes, you did.

1103
00:59:05,125 --> 00:59:08,378
But tell us,
what got you interested

1104
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:12,548
in the physical and
intellectual exhaustion

1105
00:59:12,631 --> 00:59:14,383
that seems to overcome
those of us

1106
00:59:14,466 --> 00:59:17,845
who are, let's say,
no longer 20.

1107
00:59:19,596 --> 00:59:22,390
Senescence, like senile!

1108
00:59:22,474 --> 00:59:23,808
Old people!

1109
00:59:23,892 --> 00:59:25,435
Got it!
Got it!

1110
00:59:26,186 --> 00:59:30,314
And let's face it,
we are tired much of the time.

1111
00:59:30,398 --> 00:59:32,775
That's why I've been craving
caffeine all day.

1112
00:59:32,858 --> 00:59:34,818
I thought I was dying.

1113
01:00:07,098 --> 01:00:10,268
But you still haven't answered
the fundamental question.

1114
01:00:10,351 --> 01:00:14,021
Why are we so tired?

1115
01:00:14,063 --> 01:00:17,357
Well, of course we're tired

1116
01:00:17,399 --> 01:00:21,862
because of our demanding
and hectic...

1117
01:00:24,739 --> 01:00:28,409
Do you want to know why adults
are so tired all the time?

1118
01:00:28,493 --> 01:00:30,369
Because they spend
their time obsessing

1119
01:00:30,411 --> 01:00:33,873
about these stupid, lame things
they don't really have to do.

1120
01:00:33,914 --> 01:00:35,040
Like cooking.

1121
01:00:35,124 --> 01:00:37,376
I mean, have you never
heard of takeout?

1122
01:00:37,418 --> 01:00:39,628
And cleaning?

1123
01:00:39,711 --> 01:00:41,588
Let's don't and say we did!

1124
01:00:41,671 --> 01:00:45,467
And quality time with your kids?
You know what?

1125
01:00:45,550 --> 01:00:47,218
Quit bugging 'em!

1126
01:00:47,302 --> 01:00:49,429
Leave 'em alone!
They like it!

1127
01:00:52,765 --> 01:00:56,518
I don't remember reading
any of this in your book.

1128
01:00:56,602 --> 01:01:01,106
Hello? It's called
reading between the lines!

1129
01:01:01,189 --> 01:01:02,399
Oh, my God.

1130
01:01:02,482 --> 01:01:03,984
What?

1131
01:01:04,067 --> 01:01:05,568
That's my mom.

1132
01:01:05,652 --> 01:01:07,570
Try listening
to the Yeah Yeah Yeahs,

1133
01:01:07,654 --> 01:01:09,197
The Vines, The Breeders.

1134
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:11,616
And if you're excited
about something,

1135
01:01:11,699 --> 01:01:14,201
why do you have to hold
it in all the time?

1136
01:01:14,285 --> 01:01:16,286
You know, just scream about it!

1137
01:01:16,328 --> 01:01:17,996
Okay, do this with me.

1138
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:20,499
Let's just say this
cute guy asks you out.

1139
01:01:20,582 --> 01:01:24,210
What are you gonna do?
Whoo!

1140
01:01:24,294 --> 01:01:25,295
Whoo!

1141
01:01:25,378 --> 01:01:27,130
Whoo!

1142
01:01:27,213 --> 01:01:28,506
That was pathetic!

1143
01:01:28,589 --> 01:01:31,634
You keep all that bottled up,
no wonder you're getting old!

1144
01:01:31,717 --> 01:01:33,260
I'm serious!
This guy's hot!

1145
01:01:33,344 --> 01:01:35,095
What are you gonna do?

1146
01:01:35,179 --> 01:01:37,431
God, your mom's cool.

1147
01:01:37,473 --> 01:01:39,057
I can't hear you!

1148
01:01:39,141 --> 01:01:41,810
Whoo!

1149
01:01:41,893 --> 01:01:44,396
Oh, she is dead.
Worse than dead.

1150
01:01:44,479 --> 01:01:45,605
She will spend the next year

1151
01:01:45,688 --> 01:01:48,733
in a phoneless,
dateless, Amish existence.

1152
01:01:48,816 --> 01:01:50,026
I've gotta get home.

1153
01:01:50,109 --> 01:01:52,320
I've gotta get home.

1154
01:02:08,835 --> 01:02:11,003
Listen, I need you
to give me a ride.

1155
01:02:11,087 --> 01:02:13,089
I thought your mom
didn't want you on a bike.

1156
01:02:13,172 --> 01:02:14,965
You're a little
too virtuous, kid.

1157
01:02:15,049 --> 01:02:17,801
You know what?
I'm late for my second job.

1158
01:02:17,843 --> 01:02:19,803
Just give me the ride.

1159
01:02:19,845 --> 01:02:22,222
I know my mother
will understand.

1160
01:02:22,305 --> 01:02:24,015
I'm gonna be honest with you.

1161
01:02:24,099 --> 01:02:27,936
You seem really different than
the person I thought you were.

1162
01:02:28,019 --> 01:02:30,021
I saw what you
did to Stacey's test.

1163
01:02:30,104 --> 01:02:32,315
I think you're right.

1164
01:02:32,398 --> 01:02:33,774
You're too young for me.

1165
01:02:33,858 --> 01:02:35,818
But I don't know why I did that.

1166
01:02:35,901 --> 01:02:37,903
It's really not like me.
Honestly.

1167
01:02:37,986 --> 01:02:39,446
Good luck, Anna.

1168
01:02:41,448 --> 01:02:43,867
Come on!
They'll let her retake the test!

1169
01:02:43,950 --> 01:02:45,660
Ohh!

1170
01:02:45,702 --> 01:02:48,246
That's the first time Tessie's
work hasn't put me to sleep.

1171
01:02:48,329 --> 01:02:51,374
I might even read
one of those books.

1172
01:02:51,457 --> 01:02:54,335
Hey, is Dr. Coleman
coming out soon?

1173
01:02:54,418 --> 01:02:57,921
Dottie had her escorted from
the building 10 minutes ago.

1174
01:02:58,046 --> 01:02:59,965
But she rocks, doesn't she?

1175
01:03:00,007 --> 01:03:03,510
Look, she signed my butt!

1176
01:03:03,593 --> 01:03:05,387
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

1177
01:03:12,893 --> 01:03:15,437
Can I have
a quad-choc-caramel latte?

1178
01:03:18,524 --> 01:03:19,733
Mrs. Coleman?

1179
01:03:20,901 --> 01:03:23,695
Jake!
What are you doing here?

1180
01:03:23,737 --> 01:03:27,323
I work here.
Hey, I caught the show.

1181
01:03:27,407 --> 01:03:29,617
Man, you sure were great.

1182
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:31,369
Thanks.

1183
01:03:31,452 --> 01:03:32,703
How was Anna today?

1184
01:03:32,745 --> 01:03:35,206
I mean, was she nice to you?

1185
01:03:35,247 --> 01:03:37,249
She was stressing a little,

1186
01:03:37,291 --> 01:03:39,668
but you know how it is
with school.

1187
01:03:39,751 --> 01:03:44,047
Okay, 'cause if she wasn't,
I'd have to punish her.

1188
01:03:44,923 --> 01:03:46,257
You punish her?

1189
01:03:46,341 --> 01:03:49,343
No mom who listens to The Vines
would punish anybody.

1190
01:03:49,427 --> 01:03:51,721
- You like The Vines?
- I got the bootlegs!

1191
01:03:51,804 --> 01:03:53,347
Shut up!

1192
01:03:53,431 --> 01:03:53,514
Whoo! Whoo!

1193
01:03:53,514 --> 01:03:56,100
Whoo! Whoo!

1194
01:03:56,183 --> 01:03:58,393
Oh, Anna Banana, it's you.

1195
01:03:58,477 --> 01:04:01,897
- Where's Mom?
- She ditched us at the studio.

1196
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:04,899
Harry, get down from
the table this instant!

1197
01:04:04,983 --> 01:04:07,569
I'm imitating Mom.
You should've seen her today!

1198
01:04:07,652 --> 01:04:09,153
She was so cool!

1199
01:04:09,237 --> 01:04:13,074
Whoo! Whoo!

1200
01:04:17,369 --> 01:04:19,371
Ramones?

1201
01:04:19,454 --> 01:04:20,997
Love.

1202
01:04:22,499 --> 01:04:24,501
White Stripes?

1203
01:04:24,584 --> 01:04:25,627
Can't stand 'em.

1204
01:04:25,710 --> 01:04:28,254
I know! Me neither.
I mean, get a bass player.

1205
01:04:31,674 --> 01:04:32,717
I love this song.

1206
01:04:32,758 --> 01:04:35,427
Am I so lame that I would
love "Baby, One More Time"?

1207
01:04:35,469 --> 01:04:39,097
No, this cover's a classic.

1208
01:05:06,456 --> 01:05:08,291
I gotta go.

1209
01:05:08,374 --> 01:05:09,792
What?
Don't go.

1210
01:05:09,876 --> 01:05:13,170
No, no.
I have a wedding rehearsal.

1211
01:05:13,254 --> 01:05:14,296
Okay, whose?

1212
01:05:14,380 --> 01:05:15,798
Mine.

1213
01:05:17,257 --> 01:05:18,383
Are you serious?

1214
01:05:18,467 --> 01:05:20,427
I wish I wasn't.

1215
01:05:23,847 --> 01:05:26,432
You're not really
getting married, are you?

1216
01:05:26,516 --> 01:05:29,102
This was so fun, and I'm
gonna remember it forever.

1217
01:05:29,185 --> 01:05:31,479
- Okay, but you can't...
- Jake...

1218
01:05:31,562 --> 01:05:33,439
Look, I don't know
what's going on.

1219
01:05:33,481 --> 01:05:37,109
I don't know what
this whole thing is.

1220
01:05:37,192 --> 01:05:39,820
I feel like I know you.

1221
01:05:39,903 --> 01:05:42,155
I have to go.
Really, I just...

1222
01:05:42,197 --> 01:05:45,200
Please.
Just please.

1223
01:05:46,284 --> 01:05:48,286
Let me at least
give you a ride.

1224
01:05:49,829 --> 01:05:50,913
Okay.

1225
01:06:13,768 --> 01:06:16,812
Here you are,
you little monster.

1226
01:06:16,895 --> 01:06:18,355
Okay.

1227
01:06:37,247 --> 01:06:38,207
Tess!

1228
01:06:39,708 --> 01:06:40,167
Tess!

1229
01:06:42,919 --> 01:06:44,504
Tess!

1230
01:07:00,268 --> 01:07:01,603
Where have you been?

1231
01:07:01,686 --> 01:07:04,064
You needed to be dressed
a half hour ago!

1232
01:07:04,105 --> 01:07:05,690
You tell me where you've
been, young lady!

1233
01:07:05,774 --> 01:07:07,233
Young lady?

1234
01:07:09,277 --> 01:07:11,487
Role-playing!
Her idea.

1235
01:07:11,570 --> 01:07:15,115
New therapeutic technique.
Switching points of view.

1236
01:07:15,741 --> 01:07:18,285
If I switch with Harry,
do I have to wear a thong?

1237
01:07:18,368 --> 01:07:20,454
[Mockingly]
Earthquake! Save me!

1238
01:07:20,537 --> 01:07:22,747
Get back here, you little.

1239
01:07:22,831 --> 01:07:24,666
Where do I even begin?

1240
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:27,335
Could it be your
career-killing TV appearance,

1241
01:07:27,418 --> 01:07:30,129
your nonstop partying
with my car and wallet,

1242
01:07:30,213 --> 01:07:33,591
or, perhaps, my body's
makeover from hell?

1243
01:07:33,632 --> 01:07:36,302
Are you listening
to a word I'm saying?

1244
01:07:36,385 --> 01:07:37,386
Yes.

1245
01:07:37,469 --> 01:07:39,805
And get that cheap stud
out of my ear.

1246
01:07:39,888 --> 01:07:42,015
Mom, he is so awesome.

1247
01:07:42,098 --> 01:07:44,225
- Who?
- Jake.

1248
01:07:44,267 --> 01:07:46,936
Please, Mommy, can I
go out with him? Please?

1249
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:49,480
Not in Ryan's
fiancée's body, you can't.

1250
01:07:49,564 --> 01:07:52,483
What am I supposed to
do in Ryan's fiancée's body?

1251
01:07:52,566 --> 01:07:54,568
Go to this thing tonight?
Be you?

1252
01:07:54,652 --> 01:07:56,987
That's today.
What about tomorrow, Mom?

1253
01:07:57,071 --> 01:07:59,656
I really don't want
to get married.

1254
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:01,408
I don't think you're thrilled

1255
01:08:01,491 --> 01:08:03,785
about me getting married
either, Anna.

1256
01:08:05,453 --> 01:08:06,788
Why?

1257
01:08:06,829 --> 01:08:09,290
Why can't we talk about this?

1258
01:08:09,332 --> 01:08:11,459
What is it about
Ryan you don't like?

1259
01:08:11,542 --> 01:08:13,002
He's fine.

1260
01:08:13,919 --> 01:08:16,088
But he's not your father.

1261
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:18,757
Mom, look, I don't wanna talk
about this now.

1262
01:08:18,799 --> 01:08:22,427
Time's running out to talk
about it. Please, tell me.

1263
01:08:22,511 --> 01:08:25,180
Mom, do what you want.

1264
01:08:25,263 --> 01:08:27,640
Marry the dude.
Just don't make me do it.

1265
01:08:27,724 --> 01:08:29,225
Tess?

1266
01:08:30,977 --> 01:08:33,062
[Mockingly]
Privacy's a privilege, Anna.

1267
01:08:33,145 --> 01:08:34,355
Tess?

1268
01:08:34,438 --> 01:08:35,981
Go.

1269
01:08:36,065 --> 01:08:37,357
Yo, sup?

1270
01:08:39,318 --> 01:08:42,195
I'm not really
a prying kind of guy,

1271
01:08:42,279 --> 01:08:44,656
but I was wondering
what you were doing

1272
01:08:44,739 --> 01:08:46,199
on the eve of our wedding

1273
01:08:46,282 --> 01:08:49,660
straddling some guy on the
back of a big, black Harley.

1274
01:08:49,744 --> 01:08:51,996
Hello?
It was a Ducati.

1275
01:08:52,079 --> 01:08:54,498
Is there something
you'd like to tell me?

1276
01:08:54,582 --> 01:08:56,667
Some fantasy you're trying
to get out of your system?

1277
01:08:56,750 --> 01:08:59,253
Because I'd like
to know about it now.

1278
01:09:00,545 --> 01:09:02,172
I just needed a ride.

1279
01:09:02,255 --> 01:09:04,799
I didn't really
even know the guy.

1280
01:09:04,841 --> 01:09:07,176
I didn't know what...

1281
01:09:07,218 --> 01:09:10,054
He's a friend of mine, Ryan.

1282
01:09:10,138 --> 01:09:11,681
He likes me.

1283
01:09:11,764 --> 01:09:15,267
And my mom wouldn't
let me go out with him,

1284
01:09:15,351 --> 01:09:20,814
so I just had to beg her
to check him out for me.

1285
01:09:20,897 --> 01:09:22,023
And she did.

1286
01:09:22,107 --> 01:09:24,651
And she actually came to find

1287
01:09:24,693 --> 01:09:27,612
that he's a very
together young man.

1288
01:09:27,695 --> 01:09:31,032
And she approves.

1289
01:09:33,034 --> 01:09:34,118
Really?

1290
01:09:34,201 --> 01:09:35,160
Really.

1291
01:09:35,202 --> 01:09:37,538
Snap!

1292
01:09:39,873 --> 01:09:40,874
Uh-huh.

1293
01:09:40,957 --> 01:09:43,960
So, let's do this thingy!

1294
01:09:44,044 --> 01:09:47,380
- You mean our wedding rehearsal?
- Yeah, whatever.

1295
01:10:14,363 --> 01:10:16,073
Excuse me.

1296
01:10:24,205 --> 01:10:27,166
Ooh!

1297
01:10:27,250 --> 01:10:29,127
What are you doing?

1298
01:10:29,210 --> 01:10:30,461
Shotgun!

1299
01:10:30,545 --> 01:10:31,587
I want to talk to your mom.

1300
01:10:31,671 --> 01:10:33,923
- Are you insane?
- I know I am.

1301
01:10:33,964 --> 01:10:35,090
What are you thinking?

1302
01:10:35,174 --> 01:10:38,510
How can you entertain ideas
about you and a woman her age?

1303
01:10:38,594 --> 01:10:41,054
What are you talking about?
She looks great.

1304
01:10:41,138 --> 01:10:43,431
Really? Wow.

1305
01:10:43,473 --> 01:10:45,100
No!
You have to disappear!

1306
01:10:45,183 --> 01:10:47,018
I know
it's unconventional, okay?

1307
01:10:47,101 --> 01:10:50,021
And I know nothing can happen.
I'm not stupid.

1308
01:10:50,104 --> 01:10:51,856
I just want to know her.

1309
01:10:51,939 --> 01:10:53,399
I want to talk to her.

1310
01:10:53,482 --> 01:10:55,693
Do not come near
my mother or her fiancé!

1311
01:10:55,776 --> 01:10:56,735
Do you understand?

1312
01:10:56,819 --> 01:10:58,278
I don't understand anything.

1313
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:01,782
For God's sake, you really need
to find someone your own age.

1314
01:11:04,701 --> 01:11:08,913
Anna, you're beautiful, okay?
But you're not her.

1315
01:11:08,955 --> 01:11:11,290
Stop it! Promise you'll
leave my mother alone.

1316
01:11:11,374 --> 01:11:14,210
Anna Banana!

1317
01:11:19,172 --> 01:11:19,256
I'll give you one thing.

1318
01:11:19,256 --> 01:11:20,465
I'll give you one thing.

1319
01:11:20,549 --> 01:11:22,759
He definitely likes you
for your mind.

1320
01:11:38,815 --> 01:11:40,359
Come on!
Come on!

1321
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:51,661
All right, let's do this.

1322
01:11:55,331 --> 01:11:57,499
Oh, well, there we go.

1323
01:11:57,583 --> 01:11:58,709
Oh, I'll have one.

1324
01:11:58,792 --> 01:12:01,044
- What are you doing?
- Nothing. Did you bring it?

1325
01:12:01,128 --> 01:12:02,504
Right here.
Can you get away?

1326
01:12:02,546 --> 01:12:03,588
Well, I'd love to.

1327
01:12:03,672 --> 01:12:05,090
It's just that
I'm meeting thousands

1328
01:12:05,173 --> 01:12:06,591
of 100-year-old people.

1329
01:12:06,674 --> 01:12:08,509
Those are Ryan's parents.
Hi.

1330
01:12:08,551 --> 01:12:11,345
- Doesn't make them any less old.
- Ryan.

1331
01:12:11,429 --> 01:12:15,182
Do you think I could borrow
my mother for just one minute?

1332
01:12:15,266 --> 01:12:16,684
Sure.

1333
01:12:17,851 --> 01:12:18,894
Ow!

1334
01:12:22,189 --> 01:12:25,066
Okay, there's gotta be
some clue here.

1335
01:12:27,402 --> 01:12:28,986
"A journey soon begins,

1336
01:12:29,070 --> 01:12:31,822
its prize reflected
in another's eyes."

1337
01:12:31,864 --> 01:12:33,449
Okay, that was the switch.

1338
01:12:33,532 --> 01:12:34,575
Oh, let me see.

1339
01:12:34,658 --> 01:12:36,660
Okay, blah, blah.

1340
01:12:36,702 --> 01:12:39,997
"Lack, then selfless love
will change you back."

1341
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:41,706
So that means
we're stuck like this forever.

1342
01:12:41,790 --> 01:12:43,750
Now is not a moment
for your negativity.

1343
01:12:43,833 --> 01:12:45,502
Let's try to be selfless.

1344
01:12:45,543 --> 01:12:47,378
Give me your hands.

1345
01:12:52,133 --> 01:12:54,635
I'm being selfless.
Are you being selfless?

1346
01:12:54,718 --> 01:12:56,053
Yeah, I'm being selfless.

1347
01:12:56,095 --> 01:12:58,472
You're not doing a good job.
We're still here.

1348
01:12:58,555 --> 01:13:00,390
Oh, right.
So now it's my fault.

1349
01:13:00,474 --> 01:13:04,561
Why is everything always...
It's Jake!

1350
01:13:04,644 --> 01:13:09,148
He must've followed us.
Mom, what're we gonna do?

1351
01:13:09,232 --> 01:13:10,149
Mom?

1352
01:13:10,942 --> 01:13:12,276
Mom!

1353
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:15,237
Shh! Shh!
Don't scream.

1354
01:13:15,279 --> 01:13:16,488
Just listen to us.

1355
01:13:16,572 --> 01:13:18,282
We are half a block
from the House of Blues.

1356
01:13:18,365 --> 01:13:20,867
Tell 'em you're going to
the bathroom, do the song,

1357
01:13:20,951 --> 01:13:23,578
you'll be back before
they know you've gone.

1358
01:13:23,662 --> 01:13:25,580
I tried to learn your solo,
and I suck.

1359
01:13:25,622 --> 01:13:27,915
Two bands have gone,
and they both blew.

1360
01:13:27,999 --> 01:13:29,876
We might have a chance
if you come.

1361
01:13:29,917 --> 01:13:33,254
When I say I can't,
you don't know the half of it.

1362
01:13:33,337 --> 01:13:35,297
Don't make me do this.

1363
01:13:45,140 --> 01:13:47,016
What are you doing?

1364
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:50,102
If Ryan sees you here,
it will blow everything.

1365
01:13:50,186 --> 01:13:51,103
I know.
I'm sorry.

1366
01:13:51,187 --> 01:13:53,981
It's just,
when I look into your eyes...

1367
01:13:54,064 --> 01:13:55,065
Stop it!

1368
01:13:55,149 --> 01:13:58,694
Jake, believe me, it is not
me you like, it's Anna.

1369
01:13:58,777 --> 01:14:02,113
No, you're the exciting one.
The musical one.

1370
01:14:02,197 --> 01:14:04,115
Actually, I learned it from her.

1371
01:14:04,157 --> 01:14:05,492
I'm tone-deaf.

1372
01:14:05,575 --> 01:14:07,619
- Tess?
- Shh. Don't move.

1373
01:14:07,702 --> 01:14:08,369
Tess?

1374
01:14:08,453 --> 01:14:10,496
Oh, found it!

1375
01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:12,373
- Found what?
- My earring.

1376
01:14:12,456 --> 01:14:14,625
I thought I lost it.

1377
01:14:16,668 --> 01:14:19,379
Anna's friends decided to crash.

1378
01:14:19,463 --> 01:14:20,839
You guys!

1379
01:14:20,922 --> 01:14:22,674
You know anything about this?

1380
01:14:22,757 --> 01:14:28,096
Well, I think they're trying
to get Anna to go to an audition

1381
01:14:28,137 --> 01:14:30,806
which had to be tonight,
but I said no.

1382
01:14:30,890 --> 01:14:32,141
She had to stay here.

1383
01:14:32,183 --> 01:14:34,685
- You're kidding.
- No, that's how it went down.

1384
01:14:34,768 --> 01:14:35,853
I know it's not important to you

1385
01:14:35,936 --> 01:14:37,980
and that she's just a girl
in a stupid band.

1386
01:14:38,063 --> 01:14:41,983
Look, Dr. Coleman, dude,
I'm really sorry,

1387
01:14:42,025 --> 01:14:44,486
but couldn't we borrow
Anna for 20 minutes?

1388
01:14:44,527 --> 01:14:47,989
We'd never ask you, or
anybody for anything ever again.

1389
01:14:48,031 --> 01:14:50,825
I am appalled at you two.
I clearly said...

1390
01:14:50,867 --> 01:14:51,951
Go.

1391
01:14:52,827 --> 01:14:53,661
What?

1392
01:14:53,702 --> 01:14:54,912
Go.

1393
01:14:55,496 --> 01:14:56,330
Ryan.

1394
01:14:56,413 --> 01:14:59,207
What are you still doing here?
Go! Right now!

1395
01:14:59,291 --> 01:15:00,709
Thank you so much!

1396
01:15:00,792 --> 01:15:03,753
I told you he wouldn't
totally ruin your life!

1397
01:15:03,837 --> 01:15:07,632
Mister Dude, you rock!

1398
01:15:07,674 --> 01:15:09,008
Thanks, Mitch.

1399
01:15:13,888 --> 01:15:16,181
Are you mad?

1400
01:15:16,265 --> 01:15:17,516
No.

1401
01:15:19,434 --> 01:15:21,895
Do you, like, not want
to get married now?

1402
01:15:24,230 --> 01:15:25,315
No.

1403
01:15:26,900 --> 01:15:30,236
No, I don't, not if you're
gonna put me in this role.

1404
01:15:30,319 --> 01:15:31,028
What role?

1405
01:15:31,112 --> 01:15:33,114
The role of
insensitive stepfather

1406
01:15:33,197 --> 01:15:35,908
who couldn't care less or
thinks it's a stupid band,

1407
01:15:35,991 --> 01:15:39,369
or any of the preposterous
things you just said.

1408
01:15:39,411 --> 01:15:42,205
How can you say I don't care?
I'm not that guy.

1409
01:15:42,289 --> 01:15:45,542
If that's who you think I am,
this is never gonna work.

1410
01:15:45,583 --> 01:15:48,461
When I fell in love with you,
I knew you came with a family,

1411
01:15:48,544 --> 01:15:50,463
and I respect
the hell out of that.

1412
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:51,839
You've always
put the kids first.

1413
01:15:51,881 --> 01:15:55,217
That's exactly how it should be.
That's how I want it.

1414
01:15:55,301 --> 01:15:58,679
I never pushed Anna
because I want her to like me

1415
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:01,848
on her own terms,
in her own way.

1416
01:16:02,974 --> 01:16:04,392
Wow.

1417
01:16:05,894 --> 01:16:06,811
That's very cool.

1418
01:16:06,895 --> 01:16:08,271
Yeah.

1419
01:16:09,564 --> 01:16:12,066
Now, what are you
still doing here?

1420
01:16:12,108 --> 01:16:13,067
What do you mean?

1421
01:16:13,150 --> 01:16:15,361
You should be over there.

1422
01:16:15,402 --> 01:16:17,654
That's where you ought to be.
Cheering her on.

1423
01:16:17,738 --> 01:16:19,489
That's where I want you to be.

1424
01:16:19,573 --> 01:16:21,241
Go on. Go.

1425
01:16:21,324 --> 01:16:25,370
I can hold down the fort here
for 20 minutes.

1426
01:16:25,412 --> 01:16:27,205
Wish her luck for me.

1427
01:16:28,790 --> 01:16:30,208
Okay.

1428
01:16:44,012 --> 01:16:45,263
Whoa, hold it.

1429
01:16:45,346 --> 01:16:47,432
Oh, you're not serious.
No!

1430
01:16:47,515 --> 01:16:51,060
Okay, great.
I've got I.D. For once.

1431
01:16:51,102 --> 01:16:51,811
Thanks.

1432
01:17:00,610 --> 01:17:02,779
So, it's a good crowd out there.

1433
01:17:04,155 --> 01:17:06,324
Anna, what are you doing?
What's wrong?

1434
01:17:06,407 --> 01:17:07,533
I can't do this.

1435
01:17:07,617 --> 01:17:09,285
Since when do you get nervous?

1436
01:17:09,368 --> 01:17:10,536
No, I really can't.

1437
01:17:10,620 --> 01:17:13,122
Come on, you rock
harder than anyone I know.

1438
01:17:13,205 --> 01:17:16,542
Well, the rocking may be
in short supply tonight, girls.

1439
01:17:16,625 --> 01:17:19,878
- What do you mean?
- I'm just not myself.

1440
01:17:19,962 --> 01:17:21,922
Anna, I know you're stressing.

1441
01:17:21,963 --> 01:17:25,467
We all are, and I know that
maybe it won't be brilliant,

1442
01:17:25,550 --> 01:17:27,093
but we'll forgive each other.

1443
01:17:27,135 --> 01:17:29,053
We'll find some way
to laugh about it.

1444
01:17:29,137 --> 01:17:32,431
Right now, I just really want us
to take this shot, okay?

1445
01:17:32,473 --> 01:17:34,767
We'll still love you,
even if it blows.

1446
01:17:34,808 --> 01:17:36,143
Yeah.

1447
01:17:36,226 --> 01:17:38,187
Okay, okay, okay, I'll try.

1448
01:17:38,270 --> 01:17:39,771
I mean, how hard can it be?

1449
01:17:39,855 --> 01:17:40,939
So don't forget

1450
01:17:41,022 --> 01:17:43,149
we changed the chord
progression in the first verse

1451
01:17:43,233 --> 01:17:45,944
from C-C-D to C-D-C.

1452
01:17:45,985 --> 01:17:48,029
You play notes?

1453
01:17:49,197 --> 01:17:53,075
I mean, I just thought we
could play in the key of "rock"!

1454
01:17:53,993 --> 01:17:55,995
Yeah, okay.
Let's fix your hair.

1455
01:17:56,036 --> 01:17:58,330
Yeah, what's with the bun?

1456
01:18:01,875 --> 01:18:02,834
Mrs. Coleman!

1457
01:18:02,918 --> 01:18:04,461
Jake, stop!

1458
01:18:04,544 --> 01:18:06,212
You're running away from him.

1459
01:18:06,296 --> 01:18:10,007
Jake, if you like me at all,
you will just leave me alone.

1460
01:18:10,091 --> 01:18:10,883
Yeah, but...

1461
01:18:10,967 --> 01:18:12,968
Please, no!

1462
01:18:14,053 --> 01:18:17,431
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome to the stage

1463
01:18:17,514 --> 01:18:20,851
the next act in the KllSFM
Wango Tango auditions,

1464
01:18:20,934 --> 01:18:25,980
from right here in Los Angeles,
let's give it up for Pink Slip!

1465
01:18:46,958 --> 01:18:48,376
Do something!

1466
01:19:39,589 --> 01:19:42,008
- What are you doing?
- I can't do this!

1467
01:19:42,092 --> 01:19:43,635
No, it's okay.
I unplugged you.

1468
01:19:43,718 --> 01:19:44,761
Just fake it.

1469
01:19:44,844 --> 01:19:47,055
I don't even know
how to do that.

1470
01:19:47,096 --> 01:19:49,974
You can't tell me you never
went to a rock concert.

1471
01:19:50,057 --> 01:19:51,767
- I saw the Stones once.
- Great!

1472
01:19:51,809 --> 01:19:53,811
Just go out and act like Keith!

1473
01:19:53,894 --> 01:19:55,396
Keith, right, yeah.

1474
01:19:55,479 --> 01:19:56,438
Richards, Mom!

1475
01:19:56,522 --> 01:19:57,564
I knew that.

1476
01:19:57,648 --> 01:19:59,274
Just go act like Keith.

1477
01:19:59,358 --> 01:20:01,693
Act like Keith.
Not the behavior?

1478
01:20:01,777 --> 01:20:03,194
No, just the playing!

1479
01:20:03,278 --> 01:20:06,447
Now get out there!
Your solo's coming!

1480
01:21:04,959 --> 01:21:05,585
Whoo!

1481
01:21:05,668 --> 01:21:07,795
Anna, you rock!

1482
01:21:41,827 --> 01:21:44,621
It's early, but I think
you are definitely in.

1483
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:46,456
All right!

1484
01:21:46,539 --> 01:21:48,624
- Are we in?
- Yes!

1485
01:21:49,375 --> 01:21:52,211
Oh, it was terrifying.
I had no idea what it takes.

1486
01:21:52,294 --> 01:21:53,796
- The guts.
- Thanks.

1487
01:21:53,879 --> 01:21:55,714
It's exciting.
Your music.

1488
01:21:55,756 --> 01:21:58,759
- It's not noise?
- Most definitely not noise.

1489
01:22:00,844 --> 01:22:02,804
Oh, my God!
Ryan!

1490
01:22:07,517 --> 01:22:08,726
Anna?

1491
01:22:16,442 --> 01:22:16,525
My first wedding
went like this, you know.

1492
01:22:16,525 --> 01:22:18,777
My first wedding
went like this, you know.

1493
01:22:18,860 --> 01:22:21,738
- Like what?
- She ran away with the florist.

1494
01:22:21,822 --> 01:22:24,407
Whole thing
went right down the tubes.

1495
01:22:25,075 --> 01:22:26,868
Don't make me hurt you.

1496
01:22:30,371 --> 01:22:32,248
There she is.

1497
01:22:32,289 --> 01:22:34,208
Look, look, look.

1498
01:22:46,844 --> 01:22:48,262
Mom, what's wrong?

1499
01:22:48,346 --> 01:22:50,765
I have to ask you
to do something for me.

1500
01:22:50,806 --> 01:22:53,934
Sure, whatever. After what you
just did for me, anything.

1501
01:22:54,018 --> 01:22:56,520
It needs to happen before
the toasts and speeches.

1502
01:22:56,603 --> 01:22:57,479
Okay.

1503
01:22:57,563 --> 01:23:00,857
Clearly, we're not
switching back tonight.

1504
01:23:00,941 --> 01:23:03,818
I need you to tell Ryan you
need to postpone the wedding.

1505
01:23:03,902 --> 01:23:04,778
What?

1506
01:23:04,861 --> 01:23:08,114
No, listen, I can see
you're not ready for this.

1507
01:23:08,156 --> 01:23:09,907
And I can wait.

1508
01:23:09,949 --> 01:23:11,409
I guess I was so happy,

1509
01:23:11,450 --> 01:23:14,745
I wasn't thinking about
what's best for you and Harry.

1510
01:23:14,787 --> 01:23:16,580
But, Mom.

1511
01:23:16,622 --> 01:23:20,584
If he loves me like I think
he does, he'll wait, too.

1512
01:23:20,667 --> 01:23:22,919
He'll understand.

1513
01:23:22,961 --> 01:23:26,422
He'll be very sweet
and gracious about it.

1514
01:23:26,506 --> 01:23:28,800
But please.

1515
01:23:28,841 --> 01:23:31,594
Just please let him know
that I love him.

1516
01:23:31,636 --> 01:23:35,681
And be as kind as you
possibly can for me.

1517
01:23:36,807 --> 01:23:38,392
Okay, Mom.

1518
01:23:39,309 --> 01:23:41,144
I know exactly what to say.

1519
01:23:41,186 --> 01:23:43,146
I'll be along in a minute.

1520
01:23:56,742 --> 01:23:58,285
You should sit down.

1521
01:24:04,290 --> 01:24:05,583
[Glass dings]

1522
01:24:12,340 --> 01:24:13,340
Hi.

1523
01:24:15,801 --> 01:24:19,680
I guess
I'm gonna start the toasts.

1524
01:24:21,098 --> 01:24:22,390
So, three years ago,

1525
01:24:22,474 --> 01:24:25,810
we had a really bad thing
happen in our family.

1526
01:24:25,852 --> 01:24:29,897
We lost a father and a husband,

1527
01:24:29,981 --> 01:24:33,859
and I didn't think we'd ever
be able to get over it.

1528
01:24:33,901 --> 01:24:35,444
But then...

1529
01:24:36,862 --> 01:24:41,825
This guy next to me
came into the picture.

1530
01:24:42,993 --> 01:24:45,995
And everybody could see
I was happy again.

1531
01:24:47,330 --> 01:24:49,582
I was singing
in the shower again.

1532
01:24:49,665 --> 01:24:51,792
Not well, I might add.

1533
01:24:54,879 --> 01:24:59,424
But I was still really worried
about my kids, Anna and Harry.

1534
01:24:59,508 --> 01:25:06,472
Whether they'd be able to accept
a new man in their life.

1535
01:25:07,974 --> 01:25:11,102
And now I know how Anna feels.

1536
01:25:13,771 --> 01:25:16,565
And what she feels is that...

1537
01:25:18,984 --> 01:25:22,654
No one could ever
take the place of her dad...

1538
01:25:25,573 --> 01:25:28,701
Because he was
a really great dad.

1539
01:25:29,911 --> 01:25:36,250
But somebody could be
part of a new family.

1540
01:25:36,291 --> 01:25:41,880
Its own kind of cool,
new, little unit.

1541
01:25:43,256 --> 01:25:46,092
And that for someone
as special as Ryan,

1542
01:25:46,134 --> 01:25:49,595
that we would all
just make a little room.

1543
01:25:51,847 --> 01:25:54,975
Anna really wanted her mom
to know that.

1544
01:26:04,943 --> 01:26:06,861
Earthquake!

1545
01:26:28,256 --> 01:26:29,423
Yeah!

1546
01:26:32,134 --> 01:26:35,596
And I am so psyched to be here!

1547
01:26:36,430 --> 01:26:41,726
I guess all I'm trying to say
is, Ryan, welcome to our family.

1548
01:26:41,810 --> 01:26:43,853
To the bride and groom.

1549
01:26:45,396 --> 01:26:47,065
What the hell just happened?

1550
01:26:47,148 --> 01:26:49,817
Trust me,
you don't want to know.

1551
01:27:20,971 --> 01:27:23,974
Thank you for everything.

1552
01:27:24,057 --> 01:27:25,016
I love you.

1553
01:27:25,058 --> 01:27:27,268
I love you, too.

1554
01:27:30,563 --> 01:27:31,856
What?

1555
01:27:34,984 --> 01:27:36,652
Go.

1556
01:27:36,693 --> 01:27:38,195
Go.

1557
01:27:42,699 --> 01:27:43,700
Hi.

1558
01:27:46,369 --> 01:27:50,831
Listen, I feel really stupid.

1559
01:27:51,874 --> 01:27:55,878
You know, it's just
yesterday was freaky,

1560
01:27:55,961 --> 01:28:00,298
and, I mean, I see your mom,
and I like her.

1561
01:28:00,382 --> 01:28:02,384
I mean, not "like her" like her,

1562
01:28:02,467 --> 01:28:05,345
but, you know, I mean,
like her as your mom.

1563
01:28:06,221 --> 01:28:10,057
Listen, do you think we could
just rewind this whole thing

1564
01:28:10,099 --> 01:28:11,934
and start again?

1565
01:28:12,018 --> 01:28:13,561
I'd like that.

1566
01:28:24,404 --> 01:28:27,782
You know, I've been thinking
about that kiss.

1567
01:28:27,865 --> 01:28:29,367
Kiss?

1568
01:28:32,244 --> 01:28:34,705
Remind me again how I did it.

1569
01:28:35,748 --> 01:28:37,207
In front of your mom?

1570
01:28:37,249 --> 01:28:39,668
It's okay.
She owes me.

1571
01:29:15,993 --> 01:29:18,787
Hey, why don't you ask
that girl to dance?

1572
01:29:18,870 --> 01:29:19,705
No way!

1573
01:29:19,788 --> 01:29:22,749
- Come on, go on over there.
- Stop bugging me.

1574
01:29:22,832 --> 01:29:26,544
Boy, it's true.
Youth is wasted on the young.

1575
01:29:26,628 --> 01:29:28,337
You go ask her, you old fart.

1576
01:29:28,421 --> 01:29:29,714
Now, wait a minute!

1577
01:29:29,797 --> 01:29:31,507
Why, if I was your age, oh!

1578
01:29:31,590 --> 01:29:32,383
Cookie?

1579
01:29:32,466 --> 01:29:36,637
Well, why, yes,
I don't mind if I do.

1580
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:40,515
