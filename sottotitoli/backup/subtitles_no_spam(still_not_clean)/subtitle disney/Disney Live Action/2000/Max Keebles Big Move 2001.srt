00:19:10,532 --> 00:19:14,268
THAT I ENCOURAGE
HORSEPLAY AND MALARKEY.

353
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,837
I DON'T ENCOURAGE IT.

354
00:19:15,871 --> 00:19:17,471
I EXCOURAGE IT.

355
00:19:19,274 --> 00:19:20,875
EXCOURAGE?

356
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:22,577
IT MEANS THE OPPOSITE
OF ENCOURAGE.

357
00:19:22,611 --> 00:19:23,678
LOOK IT UP.

358
00:19:23,712 --> 00:19:26,581
<i>ELLIOT!</i>

359
00:19:26,615 --> 00:19:28,683
AND SO, YOUNG MAN,
REMEMBER,

360
00:19:28,717 --> 00:19:30,985
"STUDY" RHYMES
WITH "BUDDY." SCRAM.

361
00:19:39,361 --> 00:19:40,361
HEY.

362
00:19:40,395 --> 00:19:42,263
HEY! WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

363
00:19:42,297 --> 00:19:45,833
I THOUGHT YOU SAID BAND
WASN'T COOL ENOUGH FOR YOU.

364
00:19:45,868 --> 00:19:47,068
YEAH, BUT I-I
THOUGHT IT OVER,

365
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:49,770
AND I'VE DECIDED THAT
BAND IS PRETTY, UM...

366
00:19:55,711 --> 00:19:57,411
HOT.

367
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:58,746
<i>EXCUSE ME.</i>

368
00:19:59,915 --> 00:20:00,915
WHAT?

369
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:03,084
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
SITTING IN MY SEAT?

370
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,852
DOES IT SAY YOUR NAME
ON IT OR SOMETHING?

371
00:20:04,887 --> 00:20:06,053
YES.

372
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:12,026
SO, IF YOU DON'T MIND,
SHOO-SHOO. LET'S GO.

373
00:20:13,362 --> 00:20:15,029
CAN YOU BELIEVE HER?

374
00:20:19,601 --> 00:20:21,135
HI, JENNA.

375
00:20:21,169 --> 00:20:22,303
HEY.

376
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:31,279
WELCOME, EVERYONE.

377
00:20:34,283 --> 00:20:36,384
SETTLE, PLEASE.

378
00:20:36,418 --> 00:20:38,953
I SHOULD TELL YOU
RIGHT AWAY...

379
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:41,322
YOU'LL NOTICE THAT WE ARE
A BIT CRAMPED IN HERE,

380
00:20:41,356 --> 00:20:44,258
THANKS TO SOME TEMPORARY
STORAGE FOISTED ON US

381
00:20:44,293 --> 00:20:46,661
BY SOMEONE WHO HAS
ABSOLUTELY NO APPRECIATION

382
00:20:46,695 --> 00:20:47,929
OF WHAT WE DO IN HERE.

383
00:20:47,963 --> 00:20:50,431
<i>NOW, IF YOU'LL GO</i>
<i>TO THE BEGINNING</i>

384
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:01,569
HEY, TAD.
DID YOU MISS ME?

385
00:22:01,603 --> 00:22:03,304
<i>THIS IS TAD.</i>

386
00:22:03,338 --> 00:22:05,272
<i>HE TOTALLY RULES</i>
<i>THE ANIMAL SHELTER.</i>

387
00:22:05,307 --> 00:22:07,241
<i>I HELPED NURSE HIM WHEN</i>
<i>HE WAS A BABY CHIMP,</i>

388
00:22:07,275 --> 00:22:08,843
<i>AND WE'VE BEEN BUDS</i>
<i>EVER SINCE.</i>

389
00:22:09,878 --> 00:22:11,278
HEY, MAX!

390
00:22:11,313 --> 00:22:12,423
<i>HI, MARLEY.</i>
<i>WHAT'S UP?</i>

391
00:22:12,447 --> 00:22:13,781
HEY, COULD YOU
DO ME A FAVOR

392
00:22:13,815 --> 00:22:14,782
AND FEED THE GOAT?

393
00:22:14,816 --> 00:22:16,917
SURE. WHAT'S GOING ON?

394
00:22:16,952 --> 00:22:18,152
DIDN'T YOU HEAR?

395
00:22:18,186 --> 00:22:19,854
WE'RE CLOSING DOWN.

396
00:22:19,888 --> 00:22:21,822
<i>SOME CREEP BOUGHT</i>
<i>UP THE PROPERTY</i>

397
00:22:21,857 --> 00:22:23,391
<i>AND CANCELED</i>
<i>OUR LEASE.</i>

398
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,159
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN
TO THE ANIMALS?

399
00:22:25,193 --> 00:22:26,204
WE'RE DOIN'
THE BEST WE CAN

400
00:22:26,228 --> 00:22:27,305
TO FIND HOMES
FOR ALL OF 'EM,

401
00:22:27,329 --> 00:22:28,295
BUT WE ONLY GOT
UNTIL THE END

402
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:29,397
OF THE WEEK.

403
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:31,399
<i>IT'S MESSED UP,</i>
<i>I KNOW.</i>

404
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,467
IT'S REAL
MESSED UP.

405
00:22:35,203 --> 00:22:37,872
<i>I COULDN'T</i>
<i>BELIEVE IT.</i>

406
00:22:39,374 --> 00:22:43,010
<i>SOMETHING HAD TO BE DONE,</i>
<i>BUT WHAT?</i>

407
00:22:43,045 --> 00:22:46,847
<i>I THOUGHT MAYBE MY PARENTS</i>
<i>MIGHT HAVE AN IDEA.</i>

408
00:22:46,882 --> 00:22:49,250
<i>THEY DID.</i>

409
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:51,052
WE'RE MOVING?!

410
00:22:51,086 --> 00:22:52,753
YEAH.

411
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:55,122
FOGE WANTS ME TO HEAD UP
THE NEW DIVISION.

412
00:22:55,157 --> 00:22:57,525
I-I CAN'T
BELIEVE THIS. WHEN?

413
00:22:57,559 --> 00:22:58,526
FRIDAY.

414
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,161
THIS FRIDAY?

415
00:23:02,397 --> 00:23:04,465
MAN, THIS IS
TOTALLY UNFAIR!

416
00:23:04,499 --> 00:23:06,200
I MEAN, MY...
MY LIFE IS HERE,

417
00:23:06,234 --> 00:23:08,235
MY... MY FRIENDS
ARE HERE.

418
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:09,447
<i>YEAH,</i>
<i>WE KNOW THAT, MAX.</i>

419
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:11,072
BUT YOU'RE PROBABLY
GONNA MAKE PLENTY

420
00:23:11,106 --> 00:23:12,473
OF NEW FRIENDS
IN CHICAGO.

421
00:23:12,507 --> 00:23:14,975
CH-CHICAGO?!

422
00:23:16,611 --> 00:23:20,381
THIS WAS GONNA BE
MY YEAR. HERE.

423
00:23:20,415 --> 00:23:21,482
<i>SWEETIE,</i>

424
00:23:21,516 --> 00:23:23,417
<i>WE KNOW THIS IS</i>
<i>HARD ON YOU.</i>

425
00:23:23,452 --> 00:23:25,986
IT'S HARD
ON ALL OF US.

426
00:23:26,021 --> 00:23:28,756
WELL, THEN I HAVE
A GREAT, GREAT IDEA.

427
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:30,124
LET'S NOT GO.

428
00:23:31,526 --> 00:23:35,629
FOGE IS MY BOSS.
HE'S COUNTING ON ME.

429
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,364
CAN'T YOU
JUST SAY NO?

430
00:23:37,399 --> 00:23:39,366
NO. IT'S NOT
THAT SIMPLE.

431
00:23:42,137 --> 00:23:44,038
THIS BITES.

432
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:50,678
HE'LL BE FINE.

433
00:24:02,457 --> 00:24:03,757
BUT, MAX,

434
00:24:03,792 --> 00:24:06,393
<i>CHICAGO'S, LIKE,</i>
<i>1,000 MILES AWAY.</i>

435
00:24:06,428 --> 00:24:07,995
YEAH, BETTER TELL
YOUR PARENTS

436
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:09,530
TO WATCH OUT
FOR CARJACKERS.

437
00:24:09,564 --> 00:24:10,931
THESE GUYS'LL JUST
COME UP TO YOU

438
00:24:10,966 --> 00:24:13,501
AT STOPLIGHTS
AND TAKE YOUR CAR AWAY.

439
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:15,302
I SAW IT ON<i> 20/20.</i>

440
00:24:15,337 --> 00:24:18,706
THAT'S WHY THEY CALL IT
THE MOTOR CITY.

441
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,207
MAYBE YOU COULD
HIRE A LAWYER

442
00:24:20,242 --> 00:24:21,842
AND LEGALLY
EMANCIPATE YOURSELF.

443
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:25,513
<i>YOU CAN STAY WITH ME.</i>
<i>I'LL ASK MY MOM.</i>

444
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:27,114
<i>YEAH.</i>
<i>MY DAD'LL GIVE YOU</i>

445
00:24:27,149 --> 00:24:28,849
A JOB HERE
AT THE JUNKYARD.

446
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,585
YOU KNOW WHAT?
NICE TRY, GUYS.

447
00:24:34,923 --> 00:24:37,958
YOU KNOW WHAT? FACE IT,
I'VE BEEN... I'VE BEEN FOGED.

448
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:03,567
WE MEET AGAIN, PAPERBOY.

449
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:10,441
<i>OK.</i>
<i>EVIL ICE CREAM MAN, ME.</i>

450
00:25:10,475 --> 00:25:12,142
<i>YOU'RE WONDERING WHY,</i>
<i>RIGHT?</i>

451
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:15,779
<i>UNHH!</i>

452
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:23,020
<i>WELL, I ONCE</i>
<i>FOUND A COCKROACH</i>

453
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:24,255
<i>IN MY SNOW CONE.</i>

454
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:25,633
<i>MY MOM CALLED</i>
<i>THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT,</i>

455
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:26,957
<i>AND HE GOT NAILED.</i>

456
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:28,926
<i>HE'S BEEN TRYING</i>
<i>TO NAIL ME EVER SINCE.</i>

457
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:38,002
DRAT! THE FUZZ!

458
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:41,105
<i>THIS ISN'T OVER, PAPERBOY!</i>

459
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:45,042
HELLO, OFFICER.

460
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,212
SNOW DOODLE?

461
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,951
<i>HEY, LOOK,</i>
<i>IT'S DUMPSTER BOY.</i>

462
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:55,419
IT'S REEKY STINKO,
THE GARBAGE KID.

463
00:25:57,322 --> 00:25:58,822
<i>HA, REEKY STINKO.</i>

464
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:00,658
HE JUST MADE THAT UP.
NOW, THAT'S GOOD.

465
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:03,827
<i>HEY, MAX,</i>
<i>CHECK IT OUT.</i>

466
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:04,962
I MADE UP
SOME FLYERS

467
00:26:04,996 --> 00:26:06,497
TO HELP SAVE
THE ANIMAL SHELTER.

468
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:07,598
I THOUGHT MAYBE

469
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:09,967
YOU AND I COULD PUT 'EM
UP AROUND SCHOOL?

470
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:11,001
<i>WHY BOTHER?</i>

471
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:13,437
A FLYER'S NOT GONNA
MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE.

472
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:17,908
HE DIDN'T MEAN THAT.

473
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,879
COVER ME.
I'M GOING IN.

474
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,080
<i>AAAH.</i>

475
00:26:23,114 --> 00:26:25,282
HE MOVES, HE FAKES.
RANGOON, THINK FAST.

476
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:31,188
NICE HANDS.
NOW, PICK UP THE BALL

477
00:26:31,222 --> 00:26:32,656
<i>AND PUT IT IN THE CASE.</i>

478
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:34,135
IT'S FROM KNEBWORTH'S
CITY CHAMPIONSHIP GAME.

479
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,526
<i>I'M GOING</i>
<i>ON MY WALKABOUT.</i>

480
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:46,437
MRS. RANGOON,
WHAT'S THIS?

481
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:49,273
SOME OF THE KIDS
ARE TRYING TO SAVE

482
00:26:49,307 --> 00:26:50,708
THE ANIMAL SHELTER
DOWN THE STREET.

483
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:52,276
KIDS? WHAT KIDS?

484
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:54,545
YOU KNOW, THE ONES
WITH THE SENSE OF CARING

485
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:56,146
<i>AND CIVIC DUTY.</i>

486
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:06,624
YOU THERE. CEASE!

487
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,595
WHAT IS THE MEANING
OF THIS?

488
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:14,164
HEY, I DIDN'T DO THAT.

489
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:15,666
SO YOU WANT TO SAVE

490
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,334
THE FILTHY
LITTLE BEASTS?

491
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:19,336
PERHAPS YOU WANT ME TO
GIVE THE ANIMALS MY CAR?

492
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:21,338
DO YOU WANT ME TO GIVE
MY CAR TO THE SMELLY GOAT?

493
00:27:22,707 --> 00:27:25,209
GOATS... DON'T DRIVE, SIR.

494
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:27,344
<i>I DON'T CARE WHAT</i>
<i>YOU WANT ME TO DO.</i>

495
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:29,546
THE SMELLY GOAT
WILL NEVER GET<i> MY</i> CAR.

496
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:30,981
EVER.

497
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:33,951
THE ANIMALS
HAVE NOWHERE TO GO.

498
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,986
SOME CREEP'S
CLOSING DOWN THE SHELTER.

499
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:39,523
<i>I'M</i> CLOSING DOWN

WHAT?

502
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:45,929
ALL I NEED NOW IS
THE RIGHT BULLDOZER.

503
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:48,399
<i>I'M THINKING</i>
<i>BIG AND YELLOW.</i>

504
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:50,434

00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:52,970
KNEBWORTH STADIUM,
IN YOUR HOUSE? HA HA.

506
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:54,371
YOUR HOUSE.
THAT'S RICH.

507
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:56,006

<i>COME ON, LET ME OUT!</i>

WHAT'S GOING ON?

515
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:35,913
McGINTY'S LATEST VICTIM.

516
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:38,148

OK. IT'S OK.

522
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:47,091
HE'S A LITTLE
CLAUSTROPHOBIC,

523
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:48,759
SO HE MIGHT...

524
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:53,297

NOW, CLASS, ANOTHER
FEATURE WHICH ALLOWS

553
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:55,626

TAKE THE JOB?

699
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:27,470
<i>WHAT THEN?</i>
<i>A HOME,</i>

700
00:38:27,505 --> 00:38:29,205
THE FOOD WE EAT,
THE CLOTHES YOU WEAR...

701
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,674
THAT TAKES
A LOT OF MONEY.

702
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:34,611
I JUST CAN'T SEE
WHY WE CAN'T STAY.

703
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:35,612
<i>WELL...</i>

704
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:37,313
SOMETIMES IN LIFE,

705
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:39,282
YOU GOTTA DO THINGS
THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO DO

706
00:38:39,316 --> 00:38:42,852
<i>BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE</i>
<i>WHO HAVE POWER OVER YOU</i>

TELL YOU TO DO THEM.

708
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:47,057
NO, DAD, I MEAN,
IF YOU RISE UP

709
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:50,126
AND... AND... AND SHOW
THAT YOU'RE NOT AFRAID,

<i>THOSE PEOPLE</i>

720
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,396
THE COMPUTER.

721
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:35,131
I'LL GET
THE BREATH SPRAY.

722
00:40:40,671 --> 00:40:42,539
NATURE'S DATING SERVICE.

723
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:52,081

PHEROMONE FRESH.

00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:06,996
YEAH, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT ME. I'M FINE.

Here you go.

730
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:13,169

A LITTLE DECORATION.

BY TRYING TO PACK
EVERYTHING REALLY FAST,

740
00:41:50,407 --> 00:41:51,441

YOU GET CAUGHT UP

741
00:41:51,475 --> 00:41:53,276
IN ALL THIS OLD STUFF.

742
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:57,447
REMEMBER HOW
THE KITCHEN LOOKED

743
00:41:57,481 --> 00:41:59,115
WHEN WE FIRST MOVED IN?

744
00:41:59,149 --> 00:42:00,817
BEFORE IT WAS PERFECT?

745
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:03,453
NOT REALLY.
I WAS 4.

746
00:42:03,487 --> 00:42:05,188

BUT NOT EVERYTHING'S
BAD ABOUT MOVING.

752
00:42:18,602 --> 00:42:20,870

00:44:44,248 --> 00:44:47,016
<i>OK. THE REASON JINDRAIKE</i>

00:45:30,761 --> 00:45:32,929
I DIDN'T APPROVE
ANY CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

804
00:45:32,963 --> 00:45:34,030
FOR CURTIS.

805
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:35,932
THE USUAL...
BAKE SALES, CAR WASHES,

AND CUTTING BACK

807
00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:38,611

01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:39,314
YOU BETTER
BOOK A FLIGHT.

1053
01:03:41,117 --> 01:03:42,250
WHAT?

1054
01:03:42,285 --> 01:03:44,085
MAX KEEBLE
MOVED TO CHICAGO.

1055
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:45,820
I JUST FORWARDED
HIS FILE.

1056
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:03,405
MRS. RANGOON, A MOMENT
OF YOUR TIME, PLEASE.

1057
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:07,175
SOMEONE'S GOT
SOMETHING IMPORTANT

1058
01:04:07,210 --> 01:04:09,744
TO SAY TO THE STUDENTS.

1059
01:04:09,779 --> 01:04:11,947
SOMEONE'S GOT SOMETHING
VERY IMPORTANT

1060
01:04:11,981 --> 01:04:15,050
TO SAY TO THE STUDENTS,
AND DO YOU KNOW

1061
01:04:15,084 --> 01:04:18,220
WHO THAT SOMEONE IS,
MRS. RANGOON?

1062
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:23,758
IT'S ME, MRS. RANGOON.

1063
01:04:23,793 --> 01:04:25,860
YEAH.

1064
01:04:28,164 --> 01:04:31,132
AND WAIT TILL THEY HEAR IT.

1065
01:04:32,668 --> 01:04:35,237
<i>ATTENTION, STUDENTS.</i>

1066
01:04:38,341 --> 01:04:41,476
BECAUSE OF YESTERDAY'S
CRIMES AGAINST THE SCHOOL,

1067
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:46,147
INSTIGATED BY YOUR FORMER
CLASSMATE MAX KEEBLE,

1068
01:04:46,182 --> 01:04:48,383
THE FOLLOWING
EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES

1069
01:04:48,417 --> 01:04:50,051
ARE NOW SUSPENDED...

1070
01:04:50,086 --> 01:04:54,356
ART, MUSIC, P.E.,

1071
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:56,057
FUN!

1072
01:04:56,092 --> 01:04:59,261
SUSPENDED,
DISCONTINUED, DEFUNCT!

1073
01:04:59,295 --> 01:05:01,162
GREAT. YOUR BOYFRIEND
MAX KEEBLE

1074
01:05:01,197 --> 01:05:02,931
JUST GOT US HOSED.

1075
01:05:02,965 --> 01:05:05,734
HE'S JUST MY PAPERBOY.

1076
01:05:05,768 --> 01:05:08,837
I NEVER
REALLY LIKED HIM.

1077
01:05:18,047 --> 01:05:19,614
KEEBLE!

1078
01:05:19,649 --> 01:05:21,983
OK. TODAY, CLASS,
WE'RE GOING TO REVIEW

1079
01:05:22,018 --> 01:05:25,086
SOME OF THE ELEMENTS
OF GRAMMAR.

1080
01:05:25,121 --> 01:05:28,323
McGINTY SAYS HE'S GONNA POUND ME

1081
01:05:28,357 --> 01:05:31,993
EVERY DAY FOR
THE REST OF MY LIFE.

1082
01:05:32,028 --> 01:05:35,363
DOBBS SAYS I HAVE TO
GIVE HIM ALL OF MY MONEY...

1083
01:05:35,398 --> 01:05:37,866
FOREVER.

1084
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:41,436
SOME PLAUSIBLE
DENIABILITY.

1085
01:05:50,346 --> 01:05:55,350
HI. DO YOU MIND IF I
HANG HERE FOR A WHILE,

1086
01:05:55,384 --> 01:05:57,285
BECAUSE THERE'S SOME
PEOPLE AFTER ME.

1087
01:05:57,320 --> 01:06:00,622
I DID SOME STUFF.

1088
01:06:00,656 --> 01:06:04,993
YEAH. YOU PROBABLY...

1089
01:06:05,027 --> 01:06:08,163
YEAH. I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT THE CAFETERIA.

1090
01:06:08,197 --> 01:06:10,165
BUT JINDRAIKE
HAS NO RIGHT

1091
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:12,500
TO DO WHAT HE'S DOING,
AND NOW

1092
01:06:12,535 --> 01:06:15,403
MY FRIENDS ARE GONNA GET
WAILED ON BECAUSE OF ME,

1093
01:06:15,438 --> 01:06:18,340
AND I CAN'T DO
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

1094
01:06:18,374 --> 01:06:21,843
ANY KID CAN MAKE A MESS.

1095
01:06:21,877 --> 01:06:24,713
TAKES A MAN TO CLEAN IT UP.

1096
01:06:30,252 --> 01:06:32,020
<i>IT TOOK</i>
<i>A MAN WITH A PLUNGER</i>

1097
01:06:32,054 --> 01:06:34,656
<i>TO MAKE ME REALIZE</i>
<i>THAT I HAD TO DO SOMETHING.</i>

1098
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:36,458
<i>I THOUGHT I'D STOOD UP</i>
<i>TO THE BULLIES,</i>

1099
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:38,727
<i>BUT ALL I'D REALLY DONE</i>
<i>WAS HIT AND RUN.</i>

1100
01:06:38,761 --> 01:06:42,530
<i>THAT'S NOT COURAGE.</i>
<i>THAT'S EX-COURAGE.</i>

1101
01:06:46,769 --> 01:06:50,905
AS YOU KNOW, VERBS ARE WORDS
THAT DESCRIBE ACTIONS,

1102
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:52,574
SO WHO CAN NAME A FEW?

1103
01:06:52,608 --> 01:06:57,011
BETRAY, DECEIVE, LIE.

1104
01:06:58,047 --> 01:06:59,681
<i>HOW ABOUT BURN,</i>

1105
01:06:59,715 --> 01:07:03,251
SCREW OVER,
STAB IN THE BACK?

1106
01:07:03,285 --> 01:07:05,854
HEH!

1107
01:07:05,888 --> 01:07:09,758
ATTENTION STUDENTS,
THIS IS MAX KEEBLE SPEAKING.

1108
01:07:09,792 --> 01:07:14,362
FIRST I'D LIKE TO SAY TO
MY FRIENDS MEGAN AND ROBE

1109
01:07:14,397 --> 01:07:17,732
THAT I KNOW
THAT I ACTED LIKE A JERK,

1110
01:07:17,767 --> 01:07:19,000
<i>AND I'M SORRY</i>

1111
01:07:19,034 --> 01:07:20,969
<i>FOR EVER GETTING YOU</i>
<i>INVOLVED IN THIS.</i>

1112
01:07:21,003 --> 01:07:25,340
I SCREWED UP, BUT YOU
GUYS ARE MY BEST FRIENDS,

1113
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:26,841
AND THAT'S FOREVER.

1114
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:30,779
<i>I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE</i>
<i>TO SAY, BUT I'M SORRY.</i>

1115
01:07:30,813 --> 01:07:32,614
<i>IT PROBABLY DOESN'T</i>
<i>MATTER TO YOU ANYMORE,</i>

1116
01:07:32,648 --> 01:07:33,615
<i>BUT I'M NOT MOVING.</i>

1117
01:07:33,649 --> 01:07:34,616
KEEBLE!

1118
01:07:34,650 --> 01:07:36,251
AND McGINTY AND DOBBS,

1119
01:07:36,285 --> 01:07:39,754
IT'S ME YOU WANT,
SO LEAVE MY FRIENDS ALONE.

1120
01:07:39,789 --> 01:07:43,057
I MAY HAVE RUN BEFORE, BUT I AM
ALL THROUGH RUNNING NOW.

1121
01:07:43,092 --> 01:07:46,261
YOU WANT ME, I'LL BE
IN THE PARKING LOT, 3:00.

1122
01:07:47,263 --> 01:07:48,797
CUT!

1123
01:07:48,831 --> 01:07:50,732
END OF BROADCAST!

1124
01:07:50,766 --> 01:07:53,134
THAT IS ALL. THANK YOU.

1125
01:07:55,171 --> 01:07:57,138
HELLO, MAX.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

1126
01:07:57,173 --> 01:08:00,375
GLAD YOU COULD MAKE IT.
PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT.

1127
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:03,178
ANYTHING I CAN GET FOR YOU?
SPARKLING WATER? SODA?

1128
01:08:03,212 --> 01:08:05,513
NO? OK.

1129
01:08:07,817 --> 01:08:09,651
YOU'VE ACTED
LIKE A CRIMINAL,

1130
01:08:09,685 --> 01:08:12,253
SO I'M GOING TO TREAT
YOU LIKE A CRIMINAL.

1131
01:08:13,689 --> 01:08:15,657
I'M NOT A CRIMINAL.

1132
01:08:15,724 --> 01:08:19,227
PEOPLE WHO DO CRIMES
ARE CRIMINALS, LIKE YOU.

1133
01:08:22,364 --> 01:08:24,666
YOU SHOULD BE CAREFUL
BEFORE SLANDERING

1134
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:27,268
<i>YOUR PRINCIPAL'S</i>
<i>SPOTLESS REPUTATION</i>

1135
01:08:27,303 --> 01:08:29,471
WITH WILD
AND GROUNDLESS CLAIMS.

1136
01:08:29,505 --> 01:08:32,440
THEY'RE NOT GROUNDLESS,
THEY'RE GROUND-FULL.

1137
01:08:32,475 --> 01:08:33,441
GROUND-FULL?

1138
01:08:33,476 --> 01:08:34,542
LOOK IT UP!

1139
01:08:37,012 --> 01:08:38,446
I SAW IT ON THE SCREEN.

1140
01:08:38,481 --> 01:08:41,449
YOU HAVE BEEN STEALING
FROM ALL THE SCHOOL BUDGETS

1141
01:08:41,484 --> 01:08:43,852
TO FUND YOUR STUPID
FOOTBALL STUFF.

1142
01:08:43,886 --> 01:08:45,720
SAW IT ON THE SCREEN,
DID YOU?

1143
01:08:45,754 --> 01:08:48,623
YEAH, AND IT'S TRUE.

1144
01:08:48,657 --> 01:08:51,526
YOU'RE A SMART
LITTLE BOY...

1145
01:08:52,561 --> 01:08:53,761
BUT SO AM I!

1146
01:08:56,732 --> 01:08:58,500
SO I FIDDLED
WITH THE BUDGET.

1147
01:08:58,534 --> 01:09:00,168
FIDDLESTICKS.
IT'S MY BUDGET.

1148
01:09:00,202 --> 01:09:02,570
SO WE HAVE FEWER TEXTBOOKS.
BIG DEAL.

1149
01:09:02,605 --> 01:09:04,005
<i>TEXTBOOKS ARE FOR NERDS.</i>

1150
01:09:04,039 --> 01:09:06,207
<i>FEWER BAND INSTRUMENTS...</i>
<i>WHO CARES?</i>

1151
01:09:06,242 --> 01:09:07,675
<i>BAND IS FOR LOSERS.</i>

1152
01:09:07,710 --> 01:09:08,977
COME ON!

1153
01:09:09,011 --> 01:09:11,479
SO THE JANITOR HAS TO
WORK OVERTIME FOR NO PAY.

1154
01:09:11,514 --> 01:09:13,982
HE SHOULD PAY ME
FOR THE PRIVILEGE!

1155
01:09:16,285 --> 01:09:21,289
NOW, LET ME DESCRIBE
YOUR NEXT 24 HOURS.

1156
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:24,526
I'M GOING TO METE OUT
A PUNISHMENT TO YOU

1157
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:26,794
THAT IS SO SEVERE,
FUTURE GENERATIONS

1158
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:29,731
WILL REFER TO IT
AS "THE KEEBLE."

1159
01:09:30,866 --> 01:09:33,601
THEY WILL BEG
ON BENDED KNEE...

1160
01:09:33,636 --> 01:09:37,171
"PLEASE, SIR.
NOT THE KEEBLE, SIR.

1161
01:09:37,206 --> 01:09:39,207
"I SWEAR I'LL NEVER
MISBEHAVE AGAIN

1162
01:09:39,241 --> 01:09:43,945
IF YOU'LL JUST SPARE
ME... THE KEEBLE."

1163
01:09:47,316 --> 01:09:50,118
AND SPARE THEM
I SHALL, MAX,

1164
01:09:50,152 --> 01:09:51,653
<i>FOR I AM</i>
<i>A MERCIFUL MAN.</i>

1165
01:09:51,687 --> 01:09:54,289
<i>YOUR TRANSGRESSIONS</i>
<i>ARE SO IMMENSE</i>

1166
01:09:54,323 --> 01:09:55,857
<i>THAT I WOULD BE</i>
<i>DELINQUENT...</i>

1167
01:10:04,266 --> 01:10:06,734
<i>MY BULLDOZER!</i>

1168
01:10:07,903 --> 01:10:09,337
GOODY.

1169
01:10:12,908 --> 01:10:16,878
THAT'S RIGHT!
YOU DON'T KNOW!

1170
01:10:19,181 --> 01:10:22,984
YOU THOUGHT YOU SAVED
THE ANIMAL SHELTER.

1171
01:10:23,018 --> 01:10:26,387
IT WOULD APPEAR... NOT!

1172
01:10:36,699 --> 01:10:38,766
NOW STAY THERE!

1173
01:10:39,768 --> 01:10:41,903
DON'T GO AWAY.

1174
01:10:59,955 --> 01:11:01,856
WHAT DO YOU THINK
JINDRAIKE'LL DO TO HIM?

1175
01:11:01,890 --> 01:11:02,890
WHAT DO YOU THINK

1176
01:11:02,925 --> 01:11:04,926
McGINTY AND DOBBS'LL DO TO HIM?

1177
01:11:08,897 --> 01:11:10,598
MAYBE THEY'LL JUST
FORGET THE WHOLE THING.

1178
01:11:15,137 --> 01:11:17,205
OR MAYBE THEY'LL
RIP HIS HEAD OFF.

1179
01:11:17,239 --> 01:11:19,774
WE'VE GOT TO
DO SOMETHING.

1180
01:11:19,808 --> 01:11:21,609
COME ON.

1181
01:11:27,783 --> 01:11:29,083
GOOD AFTERNOON,
MR. DOBBS.

1182
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:31,285
ALWAYS A PLEASURE, McGINTY.

1183
01:11:48,871 --> 01:11:50,972
THIS IS GONNA BE EPIC.

1184
01:11:51,006 --> 01:11:53,107
"KEEBLE CANCELED."

1185
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:59,313
HERE'S JINNY.

1186
01:12:00,683 --> 01:12:02,583
KEEBLE?

1187
01:12:03,585 --> 01:12:05,286
KEEBLE!

1188
01:12:17,399 --> 01:12:19,634
SACRILEGE!

1189
01:12:20,602 --> 01:12:22,770
OPEN THIS DOOR IMMEDIATELY!

1190
01:12:24,073 --> 01:12:27,909
CAGED LIKE AN ANIMAL.

1191
01:12:27,943 --> 01:12:29,544
IRONIC.

1192
01:12:29,578 --> 01:12:34,048
AAH!

1193
01:12:37,052 --> 01:12:41,355
SO...
IS MY WATCH RUNNING FAST,

1194
01:12:41,390 --> 01:12:44,826
OR IS OUR KEEBLE FRIEND
RUNNING SCARED?

1195
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:46,761
SOMEBODY LOOKING FOR ME?

1196
01:12:48,931 --> 01:12:53,234
KEEBLE, WELCOME TO
OUR PARKING LOT OF PAIN.

1197
01:12:53,268 --> 01:12:55,269
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!

1198
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:06,347
YOU KNOW
HOW DOCTORS SAY,

1199
01:13:06,381 --> 01:13:07,782
"THIS ISN'T GONNA
HURT A BIT"?

1200
01:13:07,816 --> 01:13:09,350
WELL,
I'M NOT A DOCTOR,

1201
01:13:09,384 --> 01:13:11,085
AND NEITHER IS McGINTY HERE.

1202
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:14,622
HE'S RIGHT.
I'M NOT A DOCTOR.

1203
01:13:14,656 --> 01:13:16,257
YEAH!

1204
01:13:16,291 --> 01:13:18,025
YOU KNOW,
THAT'S TOO BAD,

1205
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:20,561
'CAUSE YOU'RE
GONNA NEED ONE.

1206
01:13:22,164 --> 01:13:23,464
HOLD HIM!

1207
01:13:23,499 --> 01:13:25,099
LET HIM GO!

1208
01:13:25,134 --> 01:13:27,068
MEGAN, I'M HANDLING THIS!

1209
01:13:27,102 --> 01:13:28,603
SO AM I.

1210
01:13:28,637 --> 01:13:30,271
HA HA HA!

1211
01:13:30,305 --> 01:13:33,641
<i>WHAT ARE YOU GONNA</i>
<i>DO ABOUT IT?</i>

1212
01:13:33,675 --> 01:13:36,778
THIS.</i>

1213
01:13:37,946 --> 01:13:40,581
OK.

1214
01:14:05,707 --> 01:14:08,009
HA HA HA HA!

1215
01:14:29,364 --> 01:14:31,599
I'M SO SCARED.

1216
01:14:31,633 --> 01:14:32,867
YOU SHOULD BE.

1217
01:14:32,901 --> 01:14:34,302
WE'RE TAKING BACK
OUR SCHOOL.

1218
01:14:34,336 --> 01:14:36,838
YEAH. NO MORE
BEING PUSHED AROUND.

1219
01:14:36,872 --> 01:14:38,706
<i>NO MORE BEING STEPPED ON.</i>

1220
01:14:38,740 --> 01:14:40,875
NO MORE MR. NOT-NICE GUY.

1221
01:14:40,909 --> 01:14:43,444
YOUR REIGN OF TERROR
OVER THE STUDENT BODY

1222

HAS COME TO
AN ABRUPT HALT.

1223
01:14:45,581 --> 01:14:48,749
WHAT?

1224
01:14:51,887 --> 01:14:54,388
YES, PLEASE.

01:14:57,726 --> 01:14:59,160
<i>TO USE THE RESTROOM.</i>

1227

1231
01:15:04,533 --> 01:15:06,701
NO!

1232
01:15:23,819 --> 01:15:26,921
AHA! AHA!!

1233
01:15:45,774 --> 01:15:48,843
IT WAS ALL HIS IDEA!
IT WAS HIS IDEA!

1234
01:15:50,846 --> 01:15:52,346
PUT ME DOWN!

1235
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:54,048
WAIT!

1236
01:15:54,082 --> 01:15:56,117
WAIT!

1237
01:15:57,185 --> 01:15:58,753
WHAT ARE WE DOING?!

1238
01:15:58,787 --> 01:16:00,421
GETTING REVENGE
ON THE BULLIES.

1239
01:16:00,455 --> 01:16:03,157
<i>BUT THAT MAKES US</i>
<i>THE SAME AS THEM.</i>

1240
01:16:03,191 --> 01:16:04,492
DON'T YOU SEE?

1241
01:16:06,495 --> 01:16:10,798
I MEAN, I WENT ABOUT
ALL THIS THE WRONG WAY.

1242
01:16:10,832 --> 01:16:12,567
WE ARE NO BETTER
THAN THE BULLIES

1243
01:16:12,601 --> 01:16:14,635
IF WE DO EXACTLY
WHAT THE BULLIES DO.

1244
01:16:14,670 --> 01:16:18,239
<i>I MEAN, WE ALL...</i>
<i>WE NEED TO STAND TOGETHER</i>

1245
01:16:18,273 --> 01:16:21,375
AND MAKE OUR SCHOOL A
BETTER PLACE FOR EVERYONE!

1246
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:25,112
FOR YOU AND YOU AND YOU
AND EVEN YOU, WORRIED KID.

1247
01:16:26,815 --> 01:16:28,716
MAN'S GOT A POINT.

1248
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:29,750
YEAH!

1249
01:16:30,986 --> 01:16:33,387
WHAT SHOULD
WE DO WITH THEM?

1250
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:34,755
LET 'EM GO.

1251
01:16:34,790 --> 01:16:37,058
NO!

1252
01:16:41,496 --> 01:16:44,031
HA HA HA!

1253
01:16:48,837 --> 01:16:51,238
HOW COOL ARE YOU?

1254
01:16:51,273 --> 01:16:52,907
YOU KNOW. JUST...

1255
01:16:52,941 --> 01:16:55,309
<i>A BUNCH OF US ARE HAVING</i>
<i>A PARTY THIS WEEKEND.</i>

1256
01:16:56,411 --> 01:16:58,279
NINTH GRADERS ONLY.

1257
01:16:58,313 --> 01:17:00,915
<i>EXCEPT FOR YOU, MAX.</i>

1258
01:17:02,818 --> 01:17:06,687
I'M SORRY. I CAN'T COME.

1259
01:17:08,323 --> 01:17:11,592
I'M MEETING SOMEBODY.

1260
01:17:12,995 --> 01:17:14,061
SHOO SHOO!

1261
01:17:15,097 --> 01:17:16,998
WHATEVER.

1262
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:20,801
NICE MOVE, MAX.

1263
01:17:20,836 --> 01:17:23,504
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK NOT MOVING

1264
01:17:23,538 --> 01:17:25,706
WAS THE BEST MOVE OF ALL.

1265
01:17:33,382 --> 01:17:34,482
IT'S JINDRAIKE!

1266
01:17:34,516 --> 01:17:36,350
HE'S HEADING FOR
THE ANIMAL SHELTER!

1267
01:17:36,385 --> 01:17:38,486
THAT'S IT! RUN!

1268
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:41,555
SCATTER LIKE
THE CHILDREN YOU ARE!

1269
01:17:43,859 --> 01:17:46,394
<i>KNOCK, KNOCK. ANYBODY HOME?</i>

1270
01:18:04,813 --> 01:18:06,881
GIDDYAP!

1271
01:18:16,525 --> 01:18:18,693
ALL RIGHT! WHO'S FIRST?!

1272
01:18:22,330 --> 01:18:26,634
I KNOW! HOW ABOUT
THE SMELLY GOAT?!

1273
01:18:26,668 --> 01:18:28,369
BAA!

1274
01:18:29,971 --> 01:18:31,906
NOT TODAY, JINDRAIKE.

1275
01:18:33,508 --> 01:18:35,776
THAT'S FAR ENOUGH.

1276
01:18:43,618 --> 01:18:47,421
<i>ON SECOND THOUGHT, WHY</i>
<i>DON'T WE START WITH THE BOY</i>

1277
01:18:47,456 --> 01:18:51,092
WHO TRIED TO SAVE
THE SMELLY GOAT?

1278
01:18:51,126 --> 01:18:54,562
I DO NOT FEAR YOUR
DARK POWERS, BALD ONE.

1279
01:18:55,931 --> 01:18:58,599
YOUR KUNG FU'S
NO GOOD HERE, MAX.

1280
01:19:07,976 --> 01:19:09,744
WHAT IS THAT...

1281
01:19:09,778 --> 01:19:12,046
EEK! EEK! PBBBT! PBBBT!

1282
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:13,147
TRAITOR!

1283
01:19:15,450 --> 01:19:16,450
HAH!

1284
01:19:23,458 --> 01:19:27,027
AAH!

1285
01:19:50,952 --> 01:19:53,220
CEASE!

1286
01:19:55,857 --> 01:19:56,824
HE DID IT!

1287
01:19:56,858 --> 01:19:58,325
ALL RIGHT, MAX!

1288
01:20:00,328 --> 01:20:02,930
<i>YEP! I DID IT!</i>

1289
01:20:04,065 --> 01:20:05,733
<i>THE ANIMAL SHELTER</i>
<i>WAS SAFE,</i>

1290
01:20:05,767 --> 01:20:07,401
<i>THE BULLIES WERE COOKED,</i>

1291
01:20:07,435 --> 01:20:10,604
<i>AND JINDRAIKE GOT FIRED FOR</i>
<i>FIDDLING WITH THE BUDGET.</i>

1292
01:20:12,274 --> 01:20:14,842
<i>AS FOR ME AND MY FRIENDS,</i>
<i>WELL, WE WERE JUST HAPPY</i>

1293
01:20:14,876 --> 01:20:16,387
<i>THAT THE FIRST WEEK</i>
<i>OF SCHOOL WAS OVER.</i>

1294
01:20:16,411 --> 01:20:19,246
<i>NOW WE COULD CHILL</i>
<i>FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR.</i>

1295
01:20:20,949 --> 01:20:23,250
I'LL GET YOU, PAPERBOY!

1296
01:20:23,285 --> 01:20:24,752
<i>MAN!</i>
