1397
01:30:32,761 --> 01:30:35,218
It certainly is a pleasure
to meet you, ma'am.

1398
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:36,965
You and your husband...

1399
01:30:37,682 --> 01:30:40,389
certainly did a fine job
with this guy.

1400
01:30:47,525 --> 01:30:48,640
Oh, Barb.

1401
01:30:55,283 --> 01:30:57,365
TED: He's an amazing guy.
He really is.

1402
01:30:58,745 --> 01:31:00,235
I'm so happy for you.

1403
01:31:01,706 --> 01:31:03,697
(WHISPERS) Barb, I...

1404
01:31:06,002 --> 01:31:09,745
Dr. Brooks,
the honor is yours.

1405
01:31:10,090 --> 01:31:13,503
(MUSIC PLAYING)

1406
01:31:14,094 --> 01:31:16,756
Jack, I believe you earned this.

1407
01:31:17,305 --> 01:31:18,511
Oh, no, no, no.

1408
01:31:18,682 --> 01:31:21,845
I think we both should
blow it out together.

1409

(CHEERING)

1411
01:33:02,535 --> 01:33:05,151
(SIGHS) Okay, Ernie.

1412
01:33:05,747 --> 01:33:07,533
Dr. Brooks is ready
to see you now.

1413
01:33:07,832 --> 01:33:08,947
I haven't finished

1414
01:33:09,125 --> 01:33:11,116
reading about the crown
and the bridge yet.

1415
01:33:11,586 --> 01:33:14,123
-Come on.
-Oh, well...

1416

(WHINES)

1417
01:33:21,805 --> 01:33:22,965
Oh, here they are.

1418
01:33:23,139 --> 01:33:25,926
Avalanche. Little Aleutia.

1419
01:33:26,101 --> 01:33:30,970
And there's Chinook.
And my favorite, Demon Junior.

1420

(PUPPIES BARKING)

1421
01:33:37,946 --> 01:33:39,436
Good to see you, Ernie.

1422
01:33:39,614 --> 01:33:43,698
-Doctor, is this going to hurt?
-Oh, just a little.

1423
01:33:44,619 --> 01:33:47,235
More than a tickle
and less than paying your taxes.

1424
01:33:48,248 --> 01:33:49,613
(LAUGHS)

1425
01:33:52,085 --> 01:33:53,416
Okay, open wide.
