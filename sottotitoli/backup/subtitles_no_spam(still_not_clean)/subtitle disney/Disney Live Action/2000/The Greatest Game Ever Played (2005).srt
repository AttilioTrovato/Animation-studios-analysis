1
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,024
Who are you?

2
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,610
What are you doing?

3
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:53,196
There's a golf links going in here.

4
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:55,698
What's golf?

5
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:59,202
Golf is a game played by gentlemen.

6
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:01,329
Not for the likes of you.

7
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:04,207
Now, run along, boy.

8
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:11,310
Here it is, sir.

9
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:05,489
<i>Come on, boy! Let's go!</i>

10
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:51,827
<i>That's it. Sit up straight, Sarah.</i>

11
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,830
<i>Lightly on the reins. There.</i>

12
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,591
This is how we do it, Francis.

13
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:08,552
We work hard,
and we bring home the money.

14
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:17,186
Work hard. Bring home the money.

15
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,930
- Guillermo!
- Yes, sir!

16
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,390
<i>Come on!</i>

17
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,232
Francis, what in the world
are you doing?

18
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,944
It's after midnight!

19
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:52,990
You're keeping your brother up.
Go to bed.

20
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,368
Raymond, go to sleep.

21
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,828
No talking.

22
00:08:57,913 --> 00:08:59,955
No noises. I mean it.

23
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:08,255
What have you got there, Francis?

24
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,342
Francis.

25
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,305
Can I see him, Father? Please?

26
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:19,058
What's he talking about? See who?

27
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:20,601
Harry Vardon.

28
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:29,109
Any gentleman who plays this game

29
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:31,278
is not a friend to you.

30
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:32,613
I know.

31
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,115
But he's the greatest ever.

32
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:39,078
- Arthur, I don't see the harm...
- Not another word.

33
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,623
The boy goes to school today.

34
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,500
That's the end of it.

35
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:56,095
<i>Mrs. Darcy, mind the little one!
He'll try to climb those stairs.</i>

36
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:58,514
<i>Francis, leave your books.</i>

37
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:02,268
I've got shopping to do.
You come with me now.

38
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:04,436
But Father said I had to go to school...

39
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:07,690
You can miss school for one day.
I need help with me packages.

40
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,275
Come along.

41
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:33,090
What could be causing such a fuss?

42
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,219
Go on. I'll find ya.

43
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,427
Thank you very much.

44
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,637
I'll now presume upon your goodwill

45
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:23,599
and request the services of a volunteer.

46
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,351
Anyone?

47
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:36,779
Hello. What's your name?

48
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:39,323
- Francis.
- Hello, Mr. Francis.

49
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:43,952
Now, do you know what this is?

50
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,622
A brassie.

51
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:49,708
So it is. Have a bash.

52
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:10,521
That's all right, Francis.

53
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:11,897
Even in our darkest hour,

54
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:15,067
we must always remember,
you never despair.

55
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,945
Have you held
a live bird in your hands?

56
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:20,406
Not too hard to hurt her.

57
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:24,326
Just firm enough
to stop it from flying away.

58
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:27,955
Try it again.

59
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,468
Did you see that?

60
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,539
Hail the conquering hero!

61
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:12,583
Mr. Darwin.

62
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:17,087
- Is this what I think it is?
- I'm not sure, Harry.

63
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:19,298
I received a summons
from Lord Northcliffe,

64
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:21,425
- just as you did.
- Keep the change, mate.

65
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:24,178
- He's waiting inside.
- Today's the day.

66
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:27,848
But, Harry, no professional
has ever been asked

67
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:30,517
to join a gentleman's
golf club as a member.

68
00:13:30,602 --> 00:13:32,561
- First time for everything, Bernard.
- Yes.

69
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,481
Look at this place.
Why else would they want you here?

70
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:38,734
He doesn't confide in me.
I only work for him.

71
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:44,156
Ten years ago, I was clipping hedges.

72
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:53,415
Marvelous.

73
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:57,711
Brilliantly done, Harry.

74
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:00,506
Thank you, sir.

75
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,259
I'd be honored
if you'd consider adding it

76
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:06,970
- to your trophy case.
- A glittering addition.

77
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:10,724
We'd be pleased to keep it for you.
Wouldn't we, Neville?

78
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,142
Handsome.

79
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:15,562
But you might not
get it back without a tussle.

80
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,774
Don't plan on handing it back
myself without a fight.

81
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,401
Harry, I'll come right to the point.

82
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:23,278
We've had an opening at our club.

83
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:26,365
Lord Bullock chairs
the membership committee.

84
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,618
What does your father do?

85
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:33,705
- He's a gardener on Jersey, sir.
- I'm told you're Church of Rome.

86
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,958
- Mother's French?
- Yes, sir.

87
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:39,211
I believe we can work around it.

88
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:45,175
It's decided, then.
You're just the man for us.

89
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:55,727
Well, I don't know what to say, sir.

90
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:58,897
Well, say yes.
We want you to work for us.

91
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:00,065
Decent wage.

92
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:03,151
You can run your own shop.
Lessons, of course.

93
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:05,237
Charge what you like for those.

94
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,990
<i>You're the only man in England
who can set me right.</i>

95
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:12,160
<i>You'll have your work cut out.
I think it's drinks all around.</i>

96
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,913
<i>Yes, I'm told you'll work for us...</i>

97
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:16,748
<i>Golf is a game played by gentlemen.</i>

98
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,376
<i>Not for the likes of you.
Played by gentlemen.</i>

99
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,587
<i>Run your own shop. Decent wage.</i>

100
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:22,713
<i>Run along, boy.</i>

101
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,946
Francis. It's after midnight.

102
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:50,532
Just one more, Mother.

103
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:20,312
Mr. Hastings!

104
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,231
- Master Francis.
- Sir.

105
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,692
We now lack but one essential

106
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:28,320
to complete the swift
appointment of our round.

107
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,780
Your clubs.

108
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:33,408
My clubs, sir?
Caddies aren't allowed on the course.

109
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:36,703
- If Mr. Campbell sees me...
- Let me worry about Campbell.

110
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:38,622
Go. Get those clubs.

111
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,208
You go, boy. Get those clubs.

112
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,418
Hup, hup, hup, hup!

113
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,521
- Well struck, lad.
- Thank you, sir.

114
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:59,035
What did you shoot?

115
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:02,914
- An 81, sir.
- What did you take on 15?

116
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:04,708
A nine, sir.

117
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,918
So you shot an 81 the first time around

118
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:09,880
on the toughest golf course
in New England?

119
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:12,507
- With a nine?
- Well, I think I...

120
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:16,970
I saw you there, knowing that
caddies aren't supposed to play...

121
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,305
Go on.

122
00:18:19,182 --> 00:18:22,058
I think I got a little nervous, sir.

123
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:25,020
We needed to see
how you handled yourself.

124
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:26,772
Handled myself?

125
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:30,108
National Amateur Championship's
here next month.

126
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:36,156
Are you saying that I can...

127
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,574
What do I have to do? I'll do anything.

128
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:40,744
- Play in the qualifier.
- That's the easy part.

129
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:43,163
First, you have to be approved
by the executive committee.

130
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:46,416
You're a caddie here?

131
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:48,543
Yes, sir. For ten years.

132
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:51,254
I recently resigned to preserve
my status as an amateur.

133
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:54,007
What, no plans to turn professional?

134
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,968
No, sir.
I plan to have a career in business.

135
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:59,638
- Oh, business?
- Yes.

136
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:01,181
What sort of business?

137
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:02,974
Howard, we need...

138
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:05,560
Sorry. Carry on.

139
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:08,230
What's your home club?
I don't see it here.

140
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,482
They have to sponsor you.

141
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:12,150
My home club?

142
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,737
I'm between clubs.

143
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:17,572
Look, see here.

144
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:19,324
You may have qualified as a player,

145
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:23,036
but this just isn't
the sort of thing that caddies do.

146
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:26,414
- You're a caddie?
- Yes, sir, I was.

147
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:30,085
Caddies don't play in the Amateur.
It's not for your kind.

148
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,878
Members only.

149
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:34,840
We need to discuss the opening
on the greens committee.

150
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:36,049
I'm sorry.

151
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:39,553
There must be a way for somebody
who's not a member to compete.

152
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:41,179
Not this year.

153
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:49,479
As if he could afford
the $50 entrance fee.

154
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,400
Excuse me. Sir...

155
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:57,529
If I were to pay the $50,
would I still need to belong to a club?

156
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,364
Technically, no.

157
00:20:03,286 --> 00:20:06,454
You would still need a club member
in good standing to sponsor you, and...

158
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:09,624
And... that would be me.

159
00:20:12,003 --> 00:20:14,129
Fifty dollars to play golf.

160
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,089
I'll pay back every penny
from my earnings.

161
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:19,384
Is this how I failed you?
Is that all you've learned from me?

162
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,678
No, sir. But it's just a game.

163
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:23,096
A game?

164
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:24,931
A game doesn't give a man

165
00:20:25,016 --> 00:20:27,559
what he needs to make a life,
feed his family.

166
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:31,479
- If I win, great things could happen.
- Nothing will happen.

167
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:35,442
They'll use you
for their own amusement.

168
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:38,612
I can do this.
This is something I'm good at.

169
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:41,406
What if you do?

170
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,992
What will you get for your $50?

171
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:49,205
I had dreams too, Francis.

172
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,666
No matter what you do,

173
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:54,961
they'll never let you cross that street.

174
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:58,757
All I want is a chance.

175
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:06,932
Okay.

176
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:10,477
Okay, we make a bargain.

177
00:21:11,646 --> 00:21:14,105
You promise me if you lose,
no more golf.

178
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,483
You give up this fool's game.

179
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:18,860
You finish your schooling,
you learn a trade

180
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:21,821
and you bring home an honest wage.

181
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:25,700
If I don't qualify?

182
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:28,119
Yes, I promise.

183
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:01,403
It's the English edition.
It's not in print here yet.

184
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:03,905
Harry Vardon.

185
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:07,951
Thank you.

186
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:09,744
Read it, study it.

187
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:13,081
You'll need a 78 to qualify.

188
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,166
Stiffer competition.

189
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:18,169
These are the best amateurs
in the country.

190
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:20,505
Do you think I'm ready?

191
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:23,758
I don't know, and neither
will you until you're in it.

192
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:26,928
There's golf,
and there's championship golf.

193
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:33,309
Keep it for me.

194
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:35,311
I'm going to the party.

195
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:39,607
They said all players are invited.

196
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:43,361
What's it like in there?

197
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:46,448
I couldn't tell you.
I'm not allowed inside.

198
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:36,956
Do me a favor, would you?

199
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:38,583
Hi.

200
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:42,879
Hi. This boy I used to see
before I left for college is after me.

201
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:45,799
- Pretend you asked me to dance.
- There you are, you peach.

202
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:48,009
You know,
you can't avoid me all evening.

203
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:51,346
I... I said a dance, Phillip.

204
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,348
Not this one.

205
00:23:53,808 --> 00:23:56,601
- I promised this one to...
- Francis Ouimet.

206
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:59,437
- Do I know your family?
- I don't know.

207
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:01,147
- Phillip Wainwright?
- Wainwright?

208
00:24:01,232 --> 00:24:03,608
Oh, yes. Wainwrights, good people.

209
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:05,235
Wainwrights.

210
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:12,784
Well, the evening's young.
She'll catch up with you.

211
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:20,166
You're a real sport for helping.

212
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:21,918
It's no trouble.

213
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:27,924
I had the craziest day.

214
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:30,051
I take a train from Philadelphia,

215
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:32,345
my bags end up in Baltimore.

216
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:34,973
My tux is in the bags in Baltimore.

217
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:38,685
I'm wearing the houseman's suit.

218
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,898
I think you look just fine.

219
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:45,900
You too.

220
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:49,487
Is he gone?

221
00:24:51,866 --> 00:24:53,491
No, he's still watching.

222
00:24:53,576 --> 00:24:55,201
Shall we dance?

223
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:12,760
You said you're going to college?

224
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:14,929
Smith. First semester.

225
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:18,683
Where are you going?

226
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:20,810
To college?

227
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:26,191
I'm taking the year off
to consider my options.

228
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:28,943
I think that's so wise.

229
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:31,070
Perhaps you'll go to Europe.

230
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:34,449
Perhaps I will.
'Cause I have family in France.

231
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:39,704
I'm sorry. What did you
say your name was again?

232
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,623
Francis. Ouimet.

233
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,253
Oh, look! There's my brother!

234
00:25:51,634 --> 00:25:55,053
- Freddie, you must know Francis.
- Freddie.

235
00:25:56,597 --> 00:25:58,014
Caddie Boy.

236
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:01,100
Freddie, you're such a kidder.

237
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:05,563
Dad, Mother, this is Francis Ouimet.

238
00:26:05,648 --> 00:26:07,065
How do you do?

239
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:09,317
That's a beautiful dress.

240
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,985
Francis is playing in the tournament.

241
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,695
Yes, yes, I know.

242
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:15,949
Well, you boys chat.

243
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:18,910
Mother and I will be right back.

244
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:28,461
Swell girl, your daughter.

245
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:31,673
Young man,
you may have been invited,

246
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:35,009
but don't get the idea
that you belong here.

247
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,989
<i>There are only two types of player.</i>

248
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:58,866
<i>Those who keep their nerves
in control and win championships,</i>

249
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:00,827
<i>and those who do not.</i>

250
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:37,215
Five or less, and you make the cut.

251
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:40,218
Eighteen?
I can make five here in my sleep.

252
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:52,105
That's the one.

253
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:55,960
Congratulations.

254
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:57,420
That's too bad, Caddie Boy.

255
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:59,881
You could caddie
for me in the tournament.

256
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:01,966
You're available, right?

257
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:04,886
Congratulations, son. Well played.

258
00:31:43,986 --> 00:31:45,570
Empire, Harry.

259
00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:48,906
The sun never sets on us,
all that rubbish.

260
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:53,911
Consider the glory that was Greece
of Alexander the Great.

261
00:31:53,996 --> 00:31:56,539
Now you can't even find it on a map.

262
00:31:57,791 --> 00:32:01,168
Greece introduced sport to the world,

263
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:03,629
pure expression of their superiority.

264
00:32:03,714 --> 00:32:06,173
We've trodden that same road.

265
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:08,926
Football, cricket, rugby, golf.

266
00:32:09,511 --> 00:32:13,014
All the major championships
remain in British hands.

267
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:14,682
Save one.

268
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:18,311
So, what are you proposing?

269
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,438
The U.S. Open.

270
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,233
You won it before.

271
00:32:24,318 --> 00:32:26,986
I want you to mount a new campaign

272
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,946
to do to the Americans

273
00:32:29,031 --> 00:32:31,657
what Alexander did to the Persians.

274
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:34,327
Lay waste to 'em.

275
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:38,414
My papers get exclusive coverage.

276
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:41,834
Bernard here comes along
to chronicle your conquest.

277
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,628
It's our game, man.

278
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:46,756
Win their Open
and bring back that trophy.

279
00:32:49,343 --> 00:32:51,969
You pocket your winnings, of course.

280
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:54,388
Wouldn't even pay for the crossing, sir.

281
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:56,307
All expenses paid.

282
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:59,810
As part of an exhibition tour,
all sponsors arranged.

283
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:01,646
Does that cover it?

284
00:33:05,067 --> 00:33:06,984
Yep. That'd do it.

285
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:10,905
And I hear there's talk of an
honorary membership at the club.

286
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:12,698
This would clinch it.

287
00:33:12,783 --> 00:33:16,035
And I daresay His Majesty
might want to show his gratitude

288
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:18,412
to England's greatest sportsman.

289
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:21,248
Harry Vardon,
Order of the British Empire.

290
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:23,250
Has a nice ring to it.

291
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:31,217
I'll need a partner.
Somebody to share the workload with.

292
00:33:31,301 --> 00:33:33,886
My thoughts exactly.
Young Wilfred here is your man.

293
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:36,055
Top amateur in the British Isles.

294
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:37,848
Delighted, old chap.

295
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:40,059
Jolly good wheeze, what?

296
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:42,812
Giving the Yanks
a thorough thrashing.

297
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,193
I had someone else in mind.

298
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:53,030
Just a few more steps...

299
00:33:53,115 --> 00:33:55,700
Ted Ray? Christ, he's a Visigoth.

300
00:33:56,076 --> 00:33:57,159
No, he's a Jerseyman.

301
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,079
'Scuse me.

302
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:14,635
All bets off!

303
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:26,313
- Come on!
- Come on!

304
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,662
- Ted!
- Harry!

305
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:44,331
Harry! Hey! Look at you!

306
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:48,753
What's this, another night out
with your ruling class masters?

307
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:50,838
Ted Ray, Lord Northcliffe.

308
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:54,633
Lord Northcliffe?
The honor is entirely mine.

309
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:01,182
What brings you down this way, Harry?

310
00:35:31,421 --> 00:35:34,965
They moved the Open back
three months so one guy can play in it?

311
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,342
He's Harry Vardon,

312
00:35:36,426 --> 00:35:38,511
The Stylist, The Greyhound.

313
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:40,721
Hey, I don't care
if he's the man in the moon.

314
00:35:40,806 --> 00:35:42,973
They wouldn't do that for an American.

315
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:45,518
Ask Francis. He used to play.

316
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,896
- You did?
- No, not really.

317
00:35:50,232 --> 00:35:52,149
He's being modest.

318
00:35:52,234 --> 00:35:53,651
He used to be good
before he gave it up

319
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:56,737
for the glamour of retail.
Right, Francis?

320
00:35:59,074 --> 00:36:00,407
Francis!

321
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:02,910
Francis!

322
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:17,169
Oh, well. It was glorious.

323
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,839
- Wasn't it glorious?
- Yes, it was.

324
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:23,801
Have you ever heard such a voice?

325
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:28,722
It was like the music
was coming through her

326
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:31,600
from someplace else.

327
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:35,187
That's the feeling I've always wanted...

328
00:38:39,192 --> 00:38:40,901
Francis, for what?

329
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:58,877
There he is. Francis! Come here.

330
00:38:59,421 --> 00:39:03,757
Meet Robert Watson, president of
the United States Golf Association.

331
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:06,927
Francis, pleasure.

332
00:39:07,012 --> 00:39:09,346
Well, the pleasure's mine, sir.

333
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,849
Let me have a salesman
show you our equipment.

334
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:15,019
- It's the best selection in Boston.
- He's not here to buy clubs.

335
00:39:15,103 --> 00:39:18,022
I hear you live in Brookline,
not far from the country club.

336
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:19,356
Across the street.

337
00:39:19,441 --> 00:39:22,943
We're holding our Open Championship
there in two weeks.

338
00:39:23,028 --> 00:39:26,280
- Your name came up.
- My name, sir?

339
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,449
I'm looking to add
a local amateur to the field.

340
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:31,118
Harry Vardon's playing. And Ted Ray.

341
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,249
Mr. Watson,

342
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:40,502
thank you, but I can't accept.

343
00:39:41,171 --> 00:39:43,672
- Why not?
- I'm awfully busy here.

344
00:39:43,757 --> 00:39:46,800
And... I don't play golf anymore.

345
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:51,096
- How old are you, Francis?
- I'm 20, sir.

346
00:39:52,182 --> 00:39:55,059
Awfully young to be giving up
on your dreams, aren't you?

347
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:58,145
I just have different ones now,
that's all.

348
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:01,315
I'm sorry, Mr. Hastings.

349
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:04,068
There's no need to explain, Francis.

350
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:06,737
All the best.

351
00:41:07,924 --> 00:41:09,466
That swing looks familiar.

352
00:41:09,551 --> 00:41:10,717
Hey!

353
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:12,469
What are you doing here?

354
00:41:12,554 --> 00:41:14,763
Father's taking me out
for our annual round.

355
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:18,058
My brother said that
you were working here.

356
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:19,309
Your brother.

357
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:21,979
I've seen him in here a couple of times.

358
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:25,357
I was hoping you could
sell me some equipment.

359
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:27,734
I'm not actually a salesman.

360
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:30,654
Still considering your options?

361
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:31,864
Yeah.

362
00:41:36,578 --> 00:41:38,537
I'll go get you a salesman.

363
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:04,479
All right.

364
00:42:11,988 --> 00:42:13,488
Harry Vardon.

365
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:16,283
The Stylist. Practice round.

366
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:26,752
We're expecting a big turnout.
It's important we have marshals here...

367
00:42:26,836 --> 00:42:29,713
Mr. Watson. Francis Ouimet.
Could I speak to you?

368
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:30,756
Yes, what is it?

369
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,550
If that offer is still good,
I'll take you up on it.

370
00:42:33,635 --> 00:42:35,219
I'm busy. We'll think about that.

371
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:38,180
- I'm not asking for favors...
- Give us a moment?

372
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:39,806
What about Grove Street?

373
00:42:53,655 --> 00:42:55,280
Meet me here, sunup.

374
00:42:56,866 --> 00:42:58,909
You got some work to do.

375
00:43:56,676 --> 00:43:58,343
Billy, where do we stand?

376
00:43:58,428 --> 00:44:00,220
Cut line's 76.

377
00:44:00,305 --> 00:44:02,723
Six holes to make up four shots.

378
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:36,882
What is it? What's wrong?

379
00:44:36,966 --> 00:44:39,593
- You just made six straight birdies.
- I did?

380
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:42,512
Congratulations, lad.
You're in the Open.

381
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:53,440
Gentlemen?

382
00:44:54,484 --> 00:44:57,444
I want to welcome you all,
professionals and amateurs alike,

383
00:44:57,528 --> 00:45:00,655
to the 18th United States
Open Championship.

384
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:08,830
Four rounds of golf
played over the next two days

385
00:45:08,915 --> 00:45:11,750
to identify the best player in the world.

386
00:45:12,168 --> 00:45:13,960
Let's give a special welcome

387
00:45:14,045 --> 00:45:17,422
to the British Amateur Champion,
Mr. Wilfred Reid

388
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,885
and our famous professional visitors,

389
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:24,221
Harry Vardon and Ted Ray.

390
00:45:28,101 --> 00:45:31,311
I'll yield the floor
to our defending champion,

391
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:35,065
professional from Philadelphia,
John McDermott.

392
00:45:45,368 --> 00:45:47,661
If you read the papers,
you know there's talk

393
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:51,915
about the great English champions
sailing over here to play in our Open.

394
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:54,084
As the only born American
to win this cup,

395
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:56,253
I'd like to say to you boys, welcome.

396
00:45:56,337 --> 00:45:58,922
- We're happy to have you.
- Hear, hear!

397
00:45:59,257 --> 00:46:00,757
Harry Vardon was winning Opens

398
00:46:00,842 --> 00:46:03,844
back when most of us
were learning our ABC's.

399
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:08,723
He's a genius
in the history of our game.

400
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:13,228
Mr. Vardon, I know you won
this baby once before,

401
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:15,313
and I see your name here.

402
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:18,733
It's a long time ago, by the look of it.

403
00:46:21,988 --> 00:46:25,532
Well, we hope you boys have
a nice time here in Boston.

404
00:46:25,867 --> 00:46:28,326
Personally, I don't think you will.

405
00:46:28,411 --> 00:46:30,829
I don't care if you whupped every
single one of us the last six weeks,

406
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:34,624
I'm sick and tired of people saying
all you have to do to win is show up!

407
00:46:34,709 --> 00:46:37,711
This time you're not taking
our damn cup back!

408
00:46:43,384 --> 00:46:44,801
Might just have to kill that one.

409
00:46:46,095 --> 00:46:47,721
Thank you, sir.

410
00:46:48,014 --> 00:46:49,222
Billy.

411
00:46:49,891 --> 00:46:51,641
See you first thing tomorrow morning?

412
00:46:51,726 --> 00:46:53,768
- I can't.
- Well, why not?

413
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:57,731
This English fella offered me
20 bucks, 50 if he wins.

414
00:47:00,151 --> 00:47:02,986
Well, I can't give you
anything like that.

415
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:06,072
I'm sorry, Francis.
I got two kids at home.

416
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,164
Mr. Campbell?

417
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:16,208
I lost my caddie.
Do you know somebody?

418
00:47:16,292 --> 00:47:19,211
- Sorry, all the lads are taken.
- What should I do?

419
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:21,713
Hitch up your knickers.
You think Vardon and Ray

420
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:23,882
will take pity because
you carry your own bag?

421
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:26,760
This is the Open.
Every man for himself.

422
00:47:30,139 --> 00:47:32,140
What am I doing here?

423
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:36,853
Hey, Francis!

424
00:47:36,938 --> 00:47:38,855
Jack! What are you doing here?

425
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:41,358
Me and Eddie hooked school
to come watch.

426
00:47:41,442 --> 00:47:43,652
Hey. Are you still caddying
out at Franklin Park?

427
00:47:43,736 --> 00:47:46,780
- That's right.
- Can you carry for me tomorrow?

428
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:49,115
- In the Open?
- Yeah.

429
00:47:51,953 --> 00:47:54,037
Well, what happened to your guy?

430
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:55,163
He got a better offer.

431
00:47:55,248 --> 00:47:57,916
Then that guy's a big, fat jerk! What?

432
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:00,293
Jack, if you're gonna do this,

433
00:48:00,378 --> 00:48:03,129
you gotta be here
tomorrow at 7:30 sharp.

434
00:48:03,756 --> 00:48:04,798
Do it!

435
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:06,633
Can Eddie come too?

436
00:48:07,385 --> 00:48:08,718
Jack, I can't change the rules.

437
00:48:08,803 --> 00:48:11,137
You're only allowed
one man on the bag.

438
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:21,106
Maybe he could walk with us
and keep score. We'll figure it out.

439
00:48:21,983 --> 00:48:24,234
- Is that okay with you?
- Sure.

440
00:48:24,569 --> 00:48:26,653
Francis, you got yourself a deal.

441
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:28,238
That's great, Jack. That's great.

442
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:29,322
I'll see ya, Eddie.

443
00:48:34,495 --> 00:48:36,329
I'll get it, Henry!

444
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:40,917
And what do you want?

445
00:48:41,002 --> 00:48:43,128
I was hoping to speak to Sarah.
Is she here?

446
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:45,088
She left for college.

447
00:48:45,673 --> 00:48:48,008
- When, today?
- Yeah.

448
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:52,012
Give her a message for me.

449
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:56,600
Who was that, Freddie?

450
00:48:56,684 --> 00:48:59,019
It was no one. It was a peddler.

451
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:02,188
Did you hear about the caddie
playing in the Open?

452
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:05,233
Should never have happened.
Reflects badly on all concerned.

453
00:49:05,318 --> 00:49:09,154
I say, if he wants to go out
and make a fool of himself again,

454
00:49:09,238 --> 00:49:10,822
- so much the better.
- Who are you talking about?

455
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:13,617
- It's a club matter, dear.
- Caddie Boy.

456
00:49:15,036 --> 00:49:17,412
- Ouimet.
- Insists he's an amateur.

457
00:49:18,039 --> 00:49:20,248
What is the world coming to?

458
00:49:20,333 --> 00:49:23,335
- More bisque, sir?
- Thank you, Henry.

459
00:49:23,878 --> 00:49:26,838
And what kind of pie does
Audrey have for us tonight?

460
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:30,008
- Huckleberry, sir.
- Splendid.

461
00:49:40,144 --> 00:49:42,937
Did you think
you could keep it from me?

462
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:46,983
- I didn't try to.
- Your name is in the newspaper.

463
00:49:47,068 --> 00:49:49,152
Sneaking around behind my back.

464
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:52,906
- No, no, no, Father...
- You're going to stop this now.

465
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:56,284
A man knows his place
and makes his peace with it.

466
00:49:56,369 --> 00:49:59,287
- I can't talk about this.
- Then you listen.

467
00:49:59,914 --> 00:50:03,333
This is for your own good.
I am trying to protect you.

468
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:04,668
Protect me from what?

469
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:08,963
Francis, those men don't have
to earn a place in this world.

470
00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:10,924
It's given to them.

471
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:13,218
We're not those kind of people.

472
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:16,763
Now, you go tell them
that you can't do this.

473
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:18,431
It's a mistake.

474
00:50:21,936 --> 00:50:23,728
I won't do that.

475
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:29,275
You gave me your word.

476
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:33,530
You gave me your word.

477
00:50:33,781 --> 00:50:36,032
I can't quit now. I'm sorry.

478
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:41,996
Then so help me, when this is over,

479
00:50:42,081 --> 00:50:44,708
you find somewhere else to live.

480
00:50:58,931 --> 00:51:00,056
Fine.

481
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:25,123
Make sure these people
get the etiquette guide.

482
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:27,459
Most of them have never
been on a golf course.

483
00:51:27,543 --> 00:51:29,210
God help us.

484
00:51:30,379 --> 00:51:31,963
Mr. Ouimet!

485
00:51:32,882 --> 00:51:34,299
Mr. Ouimet!

486
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:39,179
Eddie!

487
00:51:39,597 --> 00:51:41,556
Where's Jack? I tee off in ten minutes.

488
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,641
Truant officer caught him.
He's in school.

489
00:51:43,726 --> 00:51:47,103
- Why aren't you with him?
- This is the U.S. Open.

490
00:51:47,188 --> 00:51:48,813
Thanks for coming to tell me.

491
00:51:48,898 --> 00:51:51,316
Mr. Ouimet, I can caddie for you.

492
00:51:52,193 --> 00:51:54,903
Eddie, my bag is as big as you are.

493
00:51:54,987 --> 00:51:55,987
But I can do it!

494
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:59,073
I carry for lots of fellas
at Franklin Park. Ask them.

495
00:51:59,158 --> 00:52:01,326
I came to make good
on what Jack promised.

496
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:05,079
I hooked school, took three
streetcars and I am big enough!

497
00:52:05,164 --> 00:52:07,123
I'm in 5th grade,
and I want to caddie for you!

498
00:52:07,208 --> 00:52:09,292
Just a second. Calm down.

499
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:12,712
How about this? I'll carry my bag,
and you walk next to me.

500
00:52:12,797 --> 00:52:14,464
- No, Mr. Ouimet!
- Call me Francis.

501
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:16,132
- I can do it, Mr. Ouimet.
- Francis.

502
00:52:16,217 --> 00:52:19,511
I know your game. I've seen you play.
I can carry that bag!

503
00:52:19,595 --> 00:52:21,304
All right. All right.

504
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:23,973
You can caddie for me. Okay?

505
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:25,642
But you're gonna have
to call me Francis.

506
00:52:25,726 --> 00:52:27,894
- Okay, Francis.
- All right.

507
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,734
You got a problem?

508
00:52:34,819 --> 00:52:37,237
This is the 9:45 tee time.

509
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:41,407
Professional from
Cattawaukee Golf Club, Albert Murray.

510
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:51,000
From Brookline, Massachusetts,
amateur Mr. Francis Ouimet.

511
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:46,973
Whatever you decide, Francis,

512
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:49,058
keep your head down
and I'll watch the ball.

513
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:50,727
We're gonna par this hole.

514
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,335
That's the stuff. One shot at a time.

515
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:33,853
One putt, we get that par.

516
00:54:33,938 --> 00:54:35,647
Nice and steady now.

517
00:54:35,731 --> 00:54:38,358
Make it roll, it'll seek the hole.

518
00:54:55,751 --> 00:54:58,002
Easy peazy, lemon squeezy.

519
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:16,479
Yes!

520
00:55:50,973 --> 00:55:53,141
He's not supposed to miss those.

521
00:55:53,225 --> 00:55:54,308
Third one this morning.

522
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:57,770
What the devil's wrong with him?

523
00:55:58,272 --> 00:56:00,523
I'm sure I don't know, sir.

524
00:56:47,071 --> 00:56:49,322
It's in the bleeding trees,
you bunch o'ninnies.

525
00:56:50,324 --> 00:56:54,494
Ted! Rotten luck, old boy!
Just one of those days, what?

526
00:56:55,037 --> 00:56:57,330
Still a lot of golf to play yet!

527
00:56:58,832 --> 00:56:59,999
Toffee-nosed git.

528
00:57:10,302 --> 00:57:12,428
<i>There are only two types of player.</i>

529
00:57:12,513 --> 00:57:15,807
<i>Those who keep their nerves
in control and win championships,</i>

530
00:57:15,891 --> 00:57:17,767
<i>and those who do not.</i>

531
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:43,751
Hey, Francis, who's that big, fat guy?

532
00:57:46,213 --> 00:57:49,173
Oh, my gosh. It's President Taft.

533
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:51,801
Get out! President Taft?

534
00:57:52,511 --> 00:57:54,637
The United States President Taft?

535
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:57,515
- You ever seen a president before?
- First time.

536
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:00,560
Hey!
How you doing there, Mr. President?

537
00:58:03,522 --> 00:58:07,066
Francis!
Did you just birdie your last hole?

538
00:58:07,526 --> 00:58:09,026
I guess I did, Frank.

539
00:58:09,111 --> 00:58:11,779
Holy smokes.
Francis, you're tied with Vardon.

540
00:58:11,864 --> 00:58:14,031
- You're in second place.
- I am?

541
00:58:14,116 --> 00:58:16,742
President Taft is talking about you.

542
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:17,994
President Taft.

543
00:58:18,078 --> 00:58:21,497
- Isn't it incredible?
- Okay, we're working here, buddy.

544
00:58:21,582 --> 00:58:22,999
Don't listen to him, Francis.

545
00:58:23,083 --> 00:58:26,460
We play our game,
let those guys worry about theirs.

546
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:30,464
I'm tied...

547
00:58:39,266 --> 00:58:42,393
You're tied with Vardon.
You're in second place.

548
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:55,281
Oh, God.

549
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:34,195
Thanks for nothing!

550
01:00:00,931 --> 01:00:03,057
We gotta settle down now, Francis.

551
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:05,685
Oh, yeah? How are we gonna do that?

552
01:00:06,353 --> 01:00:09,021
You're just gonna have to play better.

553
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:12,149
Keep your head down.

554
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:56,610
- Give me the mashie.
- You're not gonna reach with that.

555
01:00:56,695 --> 01:00:57,737
If he can, I can.

556
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:27,183
In round two,
Harry Vardon's pulled even

557
01:01:27,267 --> 01:01:29,685
with the defending champion,
John McDermott,

558
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:33,981
but Mr. Wilfred Reid
is matching him shot for shot.

559
01:01:34,608 --> 01:01:36,400
After a poor showing this morning,

560
01:01:36,485 --> 01:01:39,445
Ted Ray's stalking
the grounds like a mad brute.

561
01:01:39,571 --> 01:01:41,947
He... Mad brute.

562
01:01:42,991 --> 01:01:46,452
He may yet have something
to say about this championship.

563
01:01:57,089 --> 01:01:58,381
Quiet.

564
01:02:11,103 --> 01:02:12,686
Go, go, go, go!

565
01:02:12,771 --> 01:02:13,896
Get in.

566
01:02:19,653 --> 01:02:20,861
Blimey.

567
01:02:21,196 --> 01:02:23,322
They're easily entertained.

568
01:02:23,657 --> 01:02:25,408
I'm counting on you, old boy,

569
01:02:25,492 --> 01:02:27,910
if Vardon and that great ape
of his can't deliver.

570
01:02:27,994 --> 01:02:30,037
Quite. All for England.

571
01:02:30,122 --> 01:02:32,998
Save that patriotic gibberish
for the newspapers.

572
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:35,918
The prime minister has
promised me a seat in his cabinet

573
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:37,253
if I bring back this trophy.

574
01:02:37,337 --> 01:02:40,673
And rest assured, Wilfred,
you will be remembered.

575
01:02:42,426 --> 01:02:43,759
Bravo, Harry.

576
01:02:43,844 --> 01:02:45,928
You're tied with me for the lead.

577
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:49,390
- Very well played, sir.
- All for king and country, what?

578
01:02:49,474 --> 01:02:50,933
Wilfred played splendidly.

579
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:54,937
More than can be said
for your man Ray. Wild as a Hottentot.

580
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:58,190
After his first round,
he won't survive the cut.

581
01:02:59,985 --> 01:03:01,944
What on Earth
are they going on about?

582
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:04,155
Ted Ray's broken
the course scoring record.

583
01:03:07,534 --> 01:03:09,869
By Jove, Ray's tied for second!

584
01:03:20,213 --> 01:03:23,382
Mr. Ouimet? One question, sir!

585
01:03:23,467 --> 01:03:24,758
Francis!

586
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:28,012
Hey!
I thought you'd gone back to college!

587
01:03:28,096 --> 01:03:31,474
- I thought you quit playing!
- I guess I changed my mind.

588
01:03:31,558 --> 01:03:33,142
- That's wonderful!
- Yeah.

589
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:35,644
It's great to see you.
Can you come back tomorrow?

590
01:03:35,729 --> 01:03:38,856
- I have to leave tomorrow!
- Come back tomorrow!

591
01:03:45,864 --> 01:03:47,740
Are you his caddie?

592
01:03:49,493 --> 01:03:51,827
Give this to him, would you?

593
01:03:54,748 --> 01:03:56,123
For luck.

594
01:04:01,922 --> 01:04:04,006
Dames. Who needs them?

595
01:04:21,608 --> 01:04:23,776
Fine play today, Mr. Ouimet.

596
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:26,946
Thank you, sir. You too.

597
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:31,534
It's mostly dumb luck, though.

598
01:04:33,745 --> 01:04:35,412
On my part. Not on your part.

599
01:04:35,497 --> 01:04:38,290
I mean, you don't need luck.
I need luck.

600
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:43,087
Well, good luck, then.

601
01:04:44,005 --> 01:04:45,548
Thank you, sir.

602
01:04:53,682 --> 01:04:56,559
I cleaned them good.
Wiped the grips too.

603
01:04:59,271 --> 01:05:00,729
You did fine out there today.

604
01:05:00,814 --> 01:05:02,731
You too, Francis.

605
01:05:02,816 --> 01:05:04,567
You gonna skip school
again tomorrow?

606
01:05:04,651 --> 01:05:06,318
Let them try and stop me.

607
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:09,738
You get home safe.

608
01:05:09,823 --> 01:05:12,825
Don't you worry about me.
I'll meet you right here.

609
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:14,910
Early bird gets the worm.

610
01:05:14,995 --> 01:05:16,120
Deal.

611
01:05:37,434 --> 01:05:40,144
All I can say, ladies,
is that when the day began,

612
01:05:40,228 --> 01:05:42,479
I scarcely imagined that I'd find myself

613
01:05:42,564 --> 01:05:45,274
tied for the lead
with the immortal Harry Vardon,

614
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:48,986
and two strokes ahead
of the ever-so-capable Ted Ray.

615
01:05:49,904 --> 01:05:52,489
Speak of the devil, and up he pops.

616
01:05:52,866 --> 01:05:55,909
Excuse me, ladies.
I'll be with you presently.

617
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:02,207
I simply adore Americans.

618
01:06:02,292 --> 01:06:05,669
The exuberance,
such charming naiveté.

619
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:09,298
How do you find them, Ted?

620
01:06:09,382 --> 01:06:11,592
I should imagine you feel right at home.

621
01:06:11,676 --> 01:06:15,471
They clasp all manner of the huddled,
yearning masses to their bosoms.

622
01:06:15,555 --> 01:06:18,140
Even the lowly golf professional.

623
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:20,559
You know, I can foresee a day,

624
01:06:20,644 --> 01:06:23,562
given their democratic standards,

625
01:06:24,064 --> 01:06:26,774
when they invite your kind
into their clubhouses.

626
01:06:26,858 --> 01:06:29,026
Well, how could they resist?

627
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:32,071
Two poor lads from Jersey,
up from nothing.

628
01:06:32,155 --> 01:06:35,115
Working-class heroes
to the great unwashed.

629
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:39,078
When all Jersey's ever given us
are potatoes and dairy cows...

630
01:06:42,207 --> 01:06:44,083
Don't look over there.

631
01:06:45,085 --> 01:06:47,795
Sorry, Harry. I couldn't contain myself.

632
01:06:48,713 --> 01:06:50,172
Neither could he.

633
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:52,341
He shouldn't have
brought Jersey into it.

634
01:06:59,432 --> 01:07:02,184
My God. My nose.

635
01:07:07,107 --> 01:07:08,899
Do I look all right?

636
01:07:09,776 --> 01:07:12,820
Quite frankly, Mr. Reid,
it's an improvement.

637
01:07:16,199 --> 01:07:18,867
So, did you really see the president?

638
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:21,495
He waved at me.

639
01:07:21,579 --> 01:07:23,455
- No!
- Yes, he did. President Taft.

640
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:25,582
Can you believe Francis?

641
01:07:25,667 --> 01:07:28,961
- Why don't I sleep downstairs tonight?
- No. You sleep upstairs.

642
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:31,088
- You'll need sleep for tomorrow.
- I'm okay.

643
01:07:32,215 --> 01:07:33,465
Arthur.

644
01:07:38,012 --> 01:07:41,265
So, they call you Mr. Ouimet.

645
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:44,768
The others, it just says their names.

646
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:50,816
Well, Father, they're professionals.
I'm an amateur.

647
01:07:51,651 --> 01:07:55,028
- Let's have some dessert.
- No, wait, wait. Sit, sit.

648
01:07:56,448 --> 01:07:58,907
They're all talking about you now.

649
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:05,330
It say here that if you win,
you get no money.

650
01:08:06,499 --> 01:08:08,667
The others make money,
you get nothing.

651
01:08:08,752 --> 01:08:10,753
What does that prove?

652
01:08:12,589 --> 01:08:14,381
What does that prove?

653
01:08:15,884 --> 01:08:19,511
They don't even pay you!
What kind of work is that?

654
01:08:19,596 --> 01:08:20,763
- Arthur.
- What?

655
01:08:20,847 --> 01:08:22,598
I'll fix you a plate.

656
01:09:08,770 --> 01:09:11,355
Come on, you! Pull!

657
01:09:28,832 --> 01:09:30,457
Morning, Harry.

658
01:09:31,292 --> 01:09:33,085
Dreadful English weather.

659
01:09:36,506 --> 01:09:38,799
- How'd you sleep?
- Like a baby.

660
01:09:39,342 --> 01:09:41,343
Woke up every two hours and cried.

661
01:09:56,776 --> 01:09:58,402
Hey, Francis!

662
01:09:58,486 --> 01:10:01,446
I had a dream last night
that you shot a 72!

663
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:04,116
It won't be easy in a nor'easter.

664
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,410
You've played the course
in weather like this a hundred times.

665
01:10:06,494 --> 01:10:08,495
You're right. It's a good day for a 72.

666
01:10:08,580 --> 01:10:10,622
Okey-dokey, pipe and smokey.

667
01:10:41,905 --> 01:10:45,157
If the Brits beat us, they'll say
it was a fluke I ever won it.

668
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:48,160
They'll say it's their game,
and we're not good enough.

669
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:49,995
This is our Open.

670
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:19,811
Yes. Marvelous.

671
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:33,158
Ouimet. Ouimet. O-U-I-M-E-T.

672
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:35,994
He's only one stroke behind
Vardon and Ray after three rounds.

673
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:44,503
Go a little deeper there!

674
01:13:51,385 --> 01:13:53,386
Not here, over there.

675
01:13:55,598 --> 01:13:57,891
- Move on down!
- Yes, sir!

676
01:14:33,094 --> 01:14:34,469
Thank you.

677
01:14:42,019 --> 01:14:43,478
Ray needs that putt for the lead.

678
01:14:43,563 --> 01:14:45,814
I don't want to hear
how anyone else is doing.

679
01:14:45,898 --> 01:14:47,774
We play our own game.

680
01:14:50,736 --> 01:14:52,112
Where do we stand?

681
01:14:52,196 --> 01:14:55,782
You'd have to par the last five holes
to tie Ted for the lead.

682
01:14:55,867 --> 01:14:59,202
Dreadful conditions, Harry.
No one would blame you if you came...

683
01:14:59,287 --> 01:15:01,121
Thank you, Bernard.

684
01:16:52,233 --> 01:16:54,192
He's done for in there.

685
01:16:54,527 --> 01:16:56,778
No chance he catches him now.

686
01:17:41,198 --> 01:17:42,991
What's got into you, old thing?

687
01:17:43,075 --> 01:17:45,327
You had to go and get me angry.

688
01:17:45,411 --> 01:17:47,329
Oh, yes. My mistake.

689
01:17:48,331 --> 01:17:50,999
When I par this one,
we'll have to go at it again tomorrow.

690
01:17:51,083 --> 01:17:53,293
Playoff? What a bother.

691
01:17:53,377 --> 01:17:55,253
Yep, but there it is.

692
01:17:56,088 --> 01:17:58,173
Never seen you smoke
on the job before.

693
01:17:58,257 --> 01:18:00,592
Should've started four holes earlier.

694
01:18:54,063 --> 01:18:57,982
All square again.
Not a chance this stripling bears up.

695
01:19:00,027 --> 01:19:01,194
Probably not.

696
01:19:29,932 --> 01:19:31,099
Let them look.

697
01:19:31,183 --> 01:19:34,018
We're tied,
you're the one still playing.

698
01:19:49,034 --> 01:19:51,494
Might as well get out
of this beastly weather

699
01:19:51,579 --> 01:19:53,663
and raise a glass to British victory.

700
01:19:53,747 --> 01:19:56,249
What's that carrying his bag, a Pygmy?

701
01:20:07,970 --> 01:20:09,637
We need two strokes.
Get one here, one at...

702
01:20:09,722 --> 01:20:12,474
Francis, listen to me.
Don't think so much.

703
01:20:12,558 --> 01:20:15,894
You can't play them all at once.
Take them one at a time.

704
01:20:15,978 --> 01:20:18,438
One at a time, two down.
Two down, six to play.

705
01:20:18,522 --> 01:20:20,899
Get one here and the other on 16.

706
01:20:20,983 --> 01:20:22,942
That girl wanted me to give you this.

707
01:20:23,027 --> 01:20:25,153
- What girl?
- Sarah.

708
01:20:25,237 --> 01:20:27,113
Sarah gave you this?

709
01:20:27,198 --> 01:20:30,116
Just put it on.
Don't get all sloppy over it.

710
01:20:39,919 --> 01:20:41,044
To England.

711
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:45,423
What the hell was that?

712
01:20:45,758 --> 01:20:47,467
It's not over yet.

713
01:21:13,786 --> 01:21:15,954
Well, well. Look who's back.

714
01:21:44,733 --> 01:21:46,651
- Nice.
- Nice shot!

715
01:21:48,862 --> 01:21:51,531
Let us through. It's Ouimet's mother.

716
01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:01,332
What's happening?

717
01:22:01,959 --> 01:22:04,168
He hit it stone dead at 16.

718
01:22:04,253 --> 01:22:06,170
He's only down one.

719
01:22:07,548 --> 01:22:09,716
What does that mean? Is it good?

720
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:12,093
He makes this, it's a playoff
with Vardon and Ray.

721
01:22:12,177 --> 01:22:15,680
Dear me, it's almost beyond
one's ability to calculate.

722
01:22:17,057 --> 01:22:18,683
Don't mind if I do.

723
01:22:26,150 --> 01:22:28,443
He can't keep this up. It's impossible.

724
01:23:36,679 --> 01:23:37,720
I'll be damned.

725
01:23:40,265 --> 01:23:41,599
Yeah!

726
01:23:43,977 --> 01:23:45,561
Oh, Francis!

727
01:24:06,125 --> 01:24:09,252
There will be
an 18-hole playoff tomorrow

728
01:24:09,336 --> 01:24:12,588
between Vardon, Ray and Mr. Ouimet

729
01:24:12,673 --> 01:24:14,465
to decide the championship.

730
01:24:26,770 --> 01:24:28,813
Boy's a gift from the gods.

731
01:24:29,857 --> 01:24:32,275
They're printing
'round the clock at home.

732
01:24:32,359 --> 01:24:34,026
Imagine what they're selling here.

733
01:24:34,111 --> 01:24:37,822
Should have bought one of
these rags when I had the chance.

734
01:24:38,991 --> 01:24:42,034
It's a bold charge,
but he's spent his powder.

735
01:24:42,870 --> 01:24:45,246
It's a two-man game now, my lads.

736
01:24:45,330 --> 01:24:47,206
An all-English final.

737
01:24:48,333 --> 01:24:50,001
Well, we'll see.

738
01:24:50,836 --> 01:24:53,504
Come on, Harry. It's inconceivable.

739
01:24:54,673 --> 01:24:56,841
The man's a bloody amateur.

740
01:24:57,926 --> 01:24:59,761
When was the last time
you were beaten?

741
01:24:59,845 --> 01:25:02,013
Have you ever been beaten,
man-to-man,

742
01:25:02,097 --> 01:25:04,140
in your entire career by an amateur?

743
01:25:04,224 --> 01:25:06,601
Amateurs do not win Opens.

744
01:25:06,685 --> 01:25:08,936
Hell, the last one
who won it back home

745
01:25:09,021 --> 01:25:11,355
was 40 years ago,
and he was a gentleman.

746
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:14,859
This one's nothing of the kind.
He's a peasant. Common clay.

747
01:25:14,943 --> 01:25:17,111
He'll fold like an accordion.

748
01:25:17,196 --> 01:25:18,738
I need my rest.

749
01:25:24,369 --> 01:25:28,706
If he couldn't hit the ball a country mile,
he'd be digging ditches.

750
01:25:33,545 --> 01:25:35,463
Where are you going? Come back.
Sit down.

751
01:25:35,547 --> 01:25:37,965
Eat with me. Enjoy yourself.

752
01:25:38,050 --> 01:25:40,343
I came here to win a trophy,

753
01:25:40,803 --> 01:25:43,137
and on the face of it,
Ted Ray or I should carry it off.

754
01:25:43,222 --> 01:25:44,972
Not for you, not for England,

755
01:25:45,057 --> 01:25:48,351
but for sheer bloody pride
at being the best.

756
01:25:48,435 --> 01:25:51,979
And if Mr. Ouimet wins tomorrow,
it's because he's the best,

757
01:25:52,064 --> 01:25:53,856
because of who he is.

758
01:25:54,817 --> 01:25:56,901
Not who his father was,
not how much money he's got,

759
01:25:56,985 --> 01:25:59,278
because of who he bloody is!

760
01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:02,865
And I'll thank you to remember that.

761
01:26:05,077 --> 01:26:06,327
And I'll thank you to show the respect

762
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:09,247
a gentleman gives
as a matter of course.

763
01:26:11,124 --> 01:26:12,500
Good night.

764
01:26:37,776 --> 01:26:39,777
Do you want him to fail?

765
01:26:41,363 --> 01:26:45,324
Is that the only satisfaction
you can take from what he's doing?

766
01:26:47,703 --> 01:26:50,496
You think I want him
to break his heart?

767
01:26:53,834 --> 01:26:56,586
What will you do, Mary, when he fails?

768
01:26:56,670 --> 01:26:58,838
How will you help him then?

769
01:26:59,339 --> 01:27:01,757
All you ever do is encourage him.

770
01:27:04,219 --> 01:27:07,638
That's right. I do encourage him.

771
01:27:09,308 --> 01:27:10,892
He has a God-given talent,

772
01:27:10,976 --> 01:27:14,186
and this is his one chance
to give a voice to it.

773
01:27:17,608 --> 01:27:20,276
He's just trying to make you proud.

774
01:27:48,221 --> 01:27:51,682
"It seems impossible to believe
that this untested boy

775
01:27:51,767 --> 01:27:54,769
"could hope to beat
two seasoned champions.

776
01:27:57,689 --> 01:28:01,776
"One David against two Goliaths."

777
01:28:05,781 --> 01:28:08,491
<i>He'll have to face
Vardon and Ray alone,</i>

778
01:28:08,575 --> 01:28:11,369
<i>with a night to sleep
on the incredible situation</i>

779
01:28:11,453 --> 01:28:14,205
<i>in which he
so shockingly finds himself.</i>

780
01:28:15,666 --> 01:28:18,459
<i>Although, I suspect</i>

781
01:28:18,543 --> 01:28:21,170
<i>from the unearthly calm
he showed today,</i>

782
01:28:21,254 --> 01:28:23,547
<i>he will sleep better than most.</i>

783
01:28:26,176 --> 01:28:29,095
<i>I am not certain
I believe Ouimet can win,</i>

784
01:28:30,389 --> 01:28:33,391
<i>but I have given up
all attempts at prophecy.</i>

785
01:28:34,142 --> 01:28:37,478
<i>I will start tomorrow's round
with an open mind.</i>

786
01:28:40,232 --> 01:28:43,359
<i>It should be
the greatest game ever played.</i>

787
01:29:18,895 --> 01:29:20,271
Young man.

788
01:29:20,647 --> 01:29:23,691
- We've been talking this over.
- Talking what over?

789
01:29:23,775 --> 01:29:27,445
The members here feel that you need
as much help as you can get today.

790
01:29:27,529 --> 01:29:28,529
What kind of help?

791
01:29:28,613 --> 01:29:30,364
According to the rules, your caddie

792
01:29:30,449 --> 01:29:32,825
is the only person
who can give you advice.

793
01:29:32,909 --> 01:29:36,078
You need someone with you
who really knows our course.

794
01:29:36,163 --> 01:29:37,413
Exactly.

795
01:29:37,497 --> 01:29:39,582
Eddie's doing a great job for me.

796
01:29:39,666 --> 01:29:40,750
For God's sake, Ouimet!

797
01:29:40,834 --> 01:29:44,503
This is the U.S. Open,
not some junior club championship.

798
01:29:45,297 --> 01:29:47,715
You told Eddie this
before talking to me?

799
01:29:47,799 --> 01:29:49,300
You can't reason with a boy like that.

800
01:29:49,384 --> 01:29:52,678
We'll take up a collection
for him and pay him handsomely.

801
01:29:52,763 --> 01:29:54,722
I understand his family could use it.

802
01:29:55,140 --> 01:29:56,849
Don't let them do it, Francis!

803
01:29:56,933 --> 01:29:58,893
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

804
01:29:58,977 --> 01:30:01,312
Is it true?
You know I can't pay you, Eddie.

805
01:30:01,396 --> 01:30:04,523
I wouldn't do it for ten bucks.
I wouldn't do it for a hundred!

806
01:30:04,608 --> 01:30:07,151
Listen. You think I'd replace you?

807
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:08,444
But they said you'd want to.

808
01:30:08,528 --> 01:30:11,113
Who cares what they said?
Who cares?

809
01:30:11,490 --> 01:30:14,450
This is me and you, we're a team.
Okay?

810
01:30:14,993 --> 01:30:17,119
They don't get a vote in this.

811
01:30:17,621 --> 01:30:18,996
All right?

812
01:30:20,499 --> 01:30:22,500
I'll meet you outside.

813
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:32,426
Don't ever talk to my caddie again.

814
01:30:47,859 --> 01:30:50,069
Mr. Ouimet will play first.

815
01:30:51,863 --> 01:30:55,157
Mr. Darwin will act as honorary marker
and keep your scores.

816
01:31:00,372 --> 01:31:02,164
Gentlemen, it's time.

817
01:31:09,172 --> 01:31:10,548
Here he comes!

818
01:31:10,632 --> 01:31:12,216
Good luck, son!

819
01:31:14,636 --> 01:31:17,388
- Come on, young man!
- Come on, Ouimet!

820
01:31:17,806 --> 01:31:20,099
- Come on, Francis!
- Go!

821
01:31:22,727 --> 01:31:24,728
You can do it, Francis!

822
01:31:25,856 --> 01:31:28,065
Give us a strong showing, son!

823
01:32:34,841 --> 01:32:37,343
- Five for you there?
- That's right.

824
01:32:39,387 --> 01:32:41,305
You can do it, Francis.

825
01:32:41,389 --> 01:32:43,974
- What?
- Sorry. Did I say something?

826
01:32:44,976 --> 01:32:46,560
That was big.

827
01:33:02,994 --> 01:33:05,204
- They're human.
- What's that?

828
01:33:05,538 --> 01:33:07,373
I can play these guys, Eddie.

829
01:33:07,457 --> 01:33:08,916
Yeah? Who said you couldn't?

830
01:33:24,849 --> 01:33:26,850
Maybe they're not human.

831
01:33:36,236 --> 01:33:38,821
This is where
he fell apart the last time.

832
01:33:48,373 --> 01:33:50,124
That was yesterday.

833
01:34:05,598 --> 01:34:06,765
Sarah!

834
01:34:07,183 --> 01:34:09,643
What are you doing here?
You're supposed to be in school.

835
01:34:09,728 --> 01:34:11,937
Don't be ridiculous, Father.

836
01:34:16,443 --> 01:34:18,485
He's not cracking, Harry.

837
01:34:18,903 --> 01:34:21,071
The thought occurred to me.

838
01:34:21,740 --> 01:34:23,657
"An all-English final."

839
01:34:33,668 --> 01:34:35,336
Quiet, please.

840
01:35:09,412 --> 01:35:10,454
Stymied.

841
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:27,304
- What are you doing?
- I'll show you.

842
01:35:48,159 --> 01:35:50,369
Come on, now. Finish him.

843
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,168
Let's see if he cracks now.

844
01:36:07,011 --> 01:36:08,095
Fore right!

845
01:36:15,562 --> 01:36:17,354
He's dead in those trees.

846
01:36:33,830 --> 01:36:35,247
Mid iron.

847
01:36:55,393 --> 01:36:58,061
Done in by the monarch of the forest.

848
01:37:22,670 --> 01:37:25,172
Down to you, old thing. I'm done.

849
01:37:25,256 --> 01:37:27,257
Pity. It's a great match.

850
01:37:27,967 --> 01:37:30,052
That's the spirit, Harry.

851
01:37:33,932 --> 01:37:35,349
Come on, Ouimet!

852
01:40:21,641 --> 01:40:23,767
- Where you going with that?
- Gonna cut the corner.

853
01:40:23,851 --> 01:40:25,477
There's a bunker there.

854
01:40:25,561 --> 01:40:26,895
If he's over it, he's a chip away.

855
01:40:26,979 --> 01:40:29,815
We don't know he's over it.
It's a trick.

856
01:41:36,048 --> 01:41:37,674
This is our chance, Francis.

857
01:41:37,759 --> 01:41:40,510
Run it in there, just like yesterday.

858
01:43:33,958 --> 01:43:37,460
My God. Francis has
a one-stroke lead with one to play.

859
01:44:39,815 --> 01:44:42,108
Hold the line! Hold the line!

860
01:45:27,947 --> 01:45:29,531
Take your time.

861
01:45:39,083 --> 01:45:41,418
Let me have that towel, Eddie.

862
01:47:56,887 --> 01:47:58,304
Well done.

863
01:49:19,053 --> 01:49:21,804
You need this for 72. You can do it.

864
01:49:22,389 --> 01:49:24,807
Read it, roll it and hole it.

865
01:50:04,265 --> 01:50:05,348
Yeah!

866
01:50:27,871 --> 01:50:30,623
Yeah! Yeah!

867
01:50:31,625 --> 01:50:32,917
Yeah!

868
01:50:41,260 --> 01:50:42,552
Yeah!

869
01:50:43,053 --> 01:50:45,221
Thank you! Thank you!

870
01:50:45,306 --> 01:50:47,056
- You did it!
- Thank you!

871
01:50:48,392 --> 01:50:49,767

01:51:14,585 --> 01:51:16,502
No! No! I can't take it!

874

Well played, Mr. Ouimet.

That was a great game. I enjoyed it.

879
01:53:51,533 --> 01:53:52,867
So did I.

You deserve it.

Look at this thing, Francis.

885
01:54:29,571 --> 01:54:32,073
- It's a whopper.
- Isn't that something?

886
01:54:32,157 --> 01:54:34,116
They let you take it home with ya?

887
01:54:34,201 --> 01:54:35,618
Nobody's tried to stop me.

888
01:54:35,702 --> 01:54:38,120
Well, they'd have to get past me.

889
01:54:38,956 --> 01:54:40,873
You know something, Eddie?

890
01:54:40,958 --> 01:54:42,542
You and I are gonna be great friends.

891
01:54:42,626 --> 01:54:44,627
You said it, Francis.
