This is our target.

5
00:00:37,736 --> 00:00:40,204
He's to be captured, not harmed.

6
00:00:44,276 --> 00:00:45,573
Which man is it?

7
00:00:45,644 --> 00:00:47,475
We're after the canine.

8
00:00:47,546 --> 00:00:50,140
His name is Khyi Yag Po.

00:00:50,215 --> 00:00:53,412
Translation: ''Dog of Ageless Wonder.''

10
00:00:54,453 --> 00:00:56,819
Uh, sir, this picture's 80 years old.

11
00:00:56,888 --> 00:00:58,253
Everybody in it is dead.

12
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:01,752
Not everyone.

[man] ''Misguided youth. Your Honor...''

20
00:02:54,473 --> 00:02:57,499
That sounds so pompous.
What's another word for misguided?

21
00:02:57,576 --> 00:02:59,840
Misguided... lt's too on the money.

22
00:02:59,911 --> 00:03:01,310
Um...

23
00:03:02,814 --> 00:03:04,281
Dog!

24
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:05,941
Hey, Baxter!

25
00:03:06,017 --> 00:03:09,009
Why is it that my yard
is that mutt's outhouse?

26
00:03:09,087 --> 00:03:12,215
Uhh, FYl, calling Attila a mutt

27
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,884
is like referring to my Porsche Carrera

28
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,621
as a Buick Skylark.

29
00:03:16,695 --> 00:03:19,630
Hey, look, whatever kind of car
your dog is,

30
00:03:19,698 --> 00:03:22,633
l'd appreciate it if he wasn't
whizzin' on my shrubs.

31
00:03:22,701 --> 00:03:25,295
You know what your problem is,
Dave. You hate dogs.

32
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:28,771
No, l do not hate dogs. l dislike dogs.

33
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,037
l hate that dog. Now get outta here!

34
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,101
Stop that. You did not
hear that, did you?

35
00:03:34,179 --> 00:03:35,908
You did not hear that.

36
00:03:35,981 --> 00:03:38,211
Are you OK? Baby?

37
00:03:38,283 --> 00:03:40,342

l'm starting a trial today.

Ken Hollister's stepping down.

50
00:04:11,483 --> 00:04:14,145
Don't you want me to be the next DA?

51
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:17,416
Dave, you never make these things.

52
00:04:19,224 --> 00:04:21,021
All right. l'll take him.

53
00:04:22,227 --> 00:04:24,889
Look, you know what?
Let me say, once...

54
00:04:24,963 --> 00:04:26,760
Once l get through all this stuff,

55
00:04:26,832 --> 00:04:29,630
why don't l take you to Oahu?

56
00:04:30,969 --> 00:04:33,699
You know that way that
you always say ''Oahu,''

57
00:04:33,772 --> 00:04:35,433
and you think it's so cute?

58
00:04:35,507 --> 00:04:38,908
lt really just reminds me of how many
times you've canceled that trip.

59
00:04:38,977 --> 00:04:41,878

- Hey, good mornin', Josh.

00:04:41,947 --> 00:04:44,973

- Awesome. l'm playin' tailback.

61
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,518
Just like your old man.
Well, l can't wait.

62
00:04:47,586 --> 00:04:49,781
When can l come down
and watch you play?

63
00:04:49,855 --> 00:04:52,915
Oh, um, you know,
the games don't start for a while.

64
00:04:52,991 --> 00:04:54,458

- Yeah.

65
00:04:54,526 --> 00:04:56,187

66
00:04:57,295 --> 00:04:58,626
Hey, take the T-shirt off.

67
00:04:58,697 --> 00:05:00,631
Why? Did you drop the charges?

68
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:03,793
You know, this might be hard
for you to understand, sweetie,

69
00:05:03,869 --> 00:05:07,305
but your social studies teacher,
the Torch, is a criminal.

70
00:05:07,372 --> 00:05:10,899
What's hard to believe is that my father
is defending a puppy-murderer.

71
00:05:10,976 --> 00:05:13,410
Who're you gonna put in jail next?
Grandma?

72
00:05:13,478 --> 00:05:15,878
Well, the way she cooks,
l should put her in jail.

73
00:05:15,947 --> 00:05:17,744
Here's your... here's your buddy,

74
00:05:17,816 --> 00:05:20,216
your hero, your social studies teacher.

75
00:05:20,285 --> 00:05:23,812
This guy lit a lab on fire,
and he coulda killed a lot of people.

76
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:26,050
But he says he's innocent,
and l believe him.

77
00:05:26,124 --> 00:05:28,820
A criminal who thinks he's innocent.
What a concept.

78
00:05:28,894 --> 00:05:31,556

- That's Trey. Josh, you want a ride?

79

00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:35,924
Thanks. Here you go.

- Bye.

82
00:05:39,237 --> 00:05:40,534
[chewing] Bye.

83
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,305
[Dave] Oh, nice shirt.

84
00:05:44,376 --> 00:05:47,834
lf l was puttin' your physics teacher
in jail, you'd be thrilled.

85
00:05:47,913 --> 00:05:48,902
[door closes]

86
00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:55,783
Justin Forrester is a passionate
advocate of animal rights.

87
00:05:55,854 --> 00:05:57,845
And l respect that.

88
00:05:57,923 --> 00:06:01,188
But this case
is not about animal rights.

89
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:03,921
This case is about
whether the defendant

90
00:06:03,995 --> 00:06:07,726
criminally trespassed
on Grant & Strictland property

91
00:06:07,799 --> 00:06:09,323
and set a fire

92
00:06:09,401 --> 00:06:13,235
that caused over $300,000
worth of damage.

93
00:06:13,305 --> 00:06:17,036
[Dave] He broke into a company
that's dedicated to good.

94
00:06:17,108 --> 00:06:19,372
From their organic pet foods
and shampoos

95
00:06:19,444 --> 00:06:21,537
to their life-saving medicines.

96
00:06:21,613 --> 00:06:25,140
Created by them to help
people like you and me

97
00:06:25,216 --> 00:06:28,447

98
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,853
diabetes, obesity.

99
00:06:33,224 --> 00:06:35,988
And yes, even baldness.

100
00:06:38,196 --> 00:06:40,460
[Dave] We will, by the way,
subpoena that tape.

101
00:06:40,532 --> 00:06:43,592
l'm sorry, that's all the time l have.
Thank you all very much.

102
00:06:43,668 --> 00:06:45,602
Dave. Here's your messages.

103
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:47,968
And l am holding 4:00 open
for your kid thing.

104
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:49,700
OK, 4:00 for the kid thing.

105
00:06:49,774 --> 00:06:53,301
Unless you want me
to go for you. 'Cause l will.

106
00:06:53,378 --> 00:06:55,573
No, thanks. Thanks.

107
00:06:56,581 --> 00:06:59,744
Dave. Hey. Great opening.
You really won over that jury.

108
00:06:59,818 --> 00:07:01,683
l learned everything from you, Ken.

109
00:07:01,753 --> 00:07:02,981
- Dr. Kozak.
- Yes.

110
00:07:03,054 --> 00:07:06,023
Glad to have ya. Sorry l couldn't
put you on the stand today.

111
00:07:06,091 --> 00:07:10,050
All right. Apology accepted.
Ken tells me that when he steps down,

112
00:07:10,128 --> 00:07:12,289
you're gonna be our next
district attorney.

113
00:07:12,364 --> 00:07:14,264
- Well, that's my hope.
- Certainly.

114
00:07:14,332 --> 00:07:16,391
Well, hopefully justice
will be served.

115
00:07:16,468 --> 00:07:19,437
You'll have my support as well
as that of Grant & Strictland.

116
00:07:19,504 --> 00:07:21,131
- Till tomorrow? OK.
- All right.

117
00:07:21,206 --> 00:07:23,401
- Once again.
- We actually just shook hands.

118
00:07:23,475 --> 00:07:24,669
Yes, we did.

119
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,009
Thank you.

120
00:07:36,087 --> 00:07:38,954
Kozak. How did it go in court today?

121
00:07:39,024 --> 00:07:41,492
Ah, Mr. Strictland. Uh... [stammers]

122
00:07:41,559 --> 00:07:43,686
lt went very, very, very well, sir.

123
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:48,028
Have you unlocked the dog's secret?

124
00:07:48,099 --> 00:07:49,691
Let's talk in the elevator, OK?

125
00:07:49,768 --> 00:07:52,703
l have something to show you
l think will be most pleasing.

126
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:59,039
Have you figured out
why the dog lives so long?

127
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:02,773
Well, l... l take it you're familiar
with the concept of dog years, sir?

128
00:08:02,847 --> 00:08:05,077
- Don't like dogs.
- You don't like...

129
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,584
- l keep a squirrel.
- OK. A pet squirrel.

130
00:08:07,652 --> 00:08:09,586
That's, uh, something.

131
00:08:09,654 --> 00:08:13,317
Typically, dogs age seven years
for every human year.

132
00:08:13,391 --> 00:08:16,519
But in the case of this one,

133
00:08:16,594 --> 00:08:20,189
this one that we borrowed from Tibet,

134
00:08:20,265 --> 00:08:23,701
a genetic mutation
reversed the equation.

135
00:08:23,768 --> 00:08:25,326
What l'm saying is,

136
00:08:25,403 --> 00:08:28,531
he lives seven years
for every human year.

137
00:08:30,809 --> 00:08:33,801
Sir, this dog is over 300 years old.

138
00:08:41,486 --> 00:08:43,386
[Strictland] Hmm.

139
00:08:43,455 --> 00:08:46,788
The things you must have seen.

140
00:08:46,858 --> 00:08:49,349
lf we could transmit
that gene to humans,

141
00:08:49,427 --> 00:08:51,759
we'd all live 700 years.

142
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:54,492
We've isolated
the gene fairly quickly.

143
00:08:54,566 --> 00:08:57,034
But we're unable
to viralize it outside his body

144
00:08:57,102 --> 00:08:58,899
for transmission to other species.

145
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:03,031
Therefore, we've had to viralize
his entire genetic code in corpus.

146
00:09:04,409 --> 00:09:06,775
[Strictland] Which makes
his bodily fluids...

147
00:09:06,845 --> 00:09:09,837
- [woman] Pretty dangerous stuff.
- [Kozak] Somewhat.

148
00:09:09,914 --> 00:09:13,315
But it would have to enter the
bloodstream to do any serious damage.

149
00:09:13,384 --> 00:09:15,784
- [man] We're really careful.
- [Kozak] Mm-hm.

150
00:09:15,854 --> 00:09:18,880
- [Strictland] How close are we?
- [Kozak] How 'bout the snake?

151
00:09:18,957 --> 00:09:21,551
[Kozak] Look at the snake,
see how the snake's doin'.

152
00:09:22,594 --> 00:09:24,494
You might be interested to know, sir,

153
00:09:24,562 --> 00:09:26,587
when we got this snake,
he was nearly dead.

154
00:09:26,664 --> 00:09:29,326
He was nearly dead of old age.

155
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:33,461
Since we injected him with the serum
made from the dog's viralized DNA,

156
00:09:33,538 --> 00:09:36,063
all cell degradation has ceased.

157
00:09:36,141 --> 00:09:38,166
And he's actually
been getting stronger.

158
00:09:38,243 --> 00:09:40,768
Does that snake have a furry tail?

159
00:09:40,845 --> 00:09:42,779
Uh, that would be a-a-a side effect

160
00:09:42,847 --> 00:09:44,906
that l would classify as, uh, minor.

161
00:09:44,983 --> 00:09:48,976
Kozak, dry mouth is a minor side effect.

162
00:09:49,053 --> 00:09:51,647
Growing a dog's tail is... [stammers]

163
00:09:51,723 --> 00:09:53,714
lt makes your serum into a carnival act.

164
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:57,488
You know what? Your job is to relax.
Our job is to work out the kinks, OK?

165
00:09:57,562 --> 00:09:59,621
Because when we do, Lance,

166
00:09:59,697 --> 00:10:02,825
you and l are gonna have the patent
on the fountain of youth.

167
00:10:02,901 --> 00:10:04,835
<i>[cell phone rings]</i>

168
00:10:04,903 --> 00:10:06,962
Ah. Excuse me.

169
00:10:07,038 --> 00:10:10,098
Uh, yeah, Security. Go for Kozak.

00:10:16,514 --> 00:10:19,677
When l called you, it was to make sure
these people were arrested.

173
00:10:19,751 --> 00:10:21,309
l understand that.

174
00:10:21,386 --> 00:10:25,550
lf we arrest them, they turn into
rebels with a cause on the 6:00 news.

175
00:10:25,623 --> 00:10:28,786
lf we leave 'em there, they're just
kids layin' on the sidewalk.

176
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,385
- [girl] Puppy-killers!
- ...so we're lying down!

177
00:10:31,462 --> 00:10:33,794
Good advice. All right.
Thanks for your help.

178
00:10:33,865 --> 00:10:36,129
- You bet.
- l'm good.

179
00:10:36,201 --> 00:10:37,793
Let's go.

180
00:10:37,869 --> 00:10:41,202
All right, fellas, let's just get
some sort of perimeter on this.

181
00:10:41,272 --> 00:10:43,399
They're just kids.
Let 'em do their thing.

182
00:10:43,474 --> 00:10:45,806
When they get hungry,
they're all gonna go home.

183
00:10:45,877 --> 00:10:46,866
Hold on a minute.

184
00:10:46,945 --> 00:10:49,470
Grant & Strictland's lying,
so we're lying down!

185
00:10:49,547 --> 00:10:52,744
Grant & Strictland's lying,
so we're lying down!

186
00:10:52,817 --> 00:10:55,479
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, Carly.

187
00:10:56,487 --> 00:10:57,681
What're you doing here?

188
00:10:57,755 --> 00:10:59,848
l'm lying down for what l believe in.

189
00:10:59,924 --> 00:11:01,687
Uh, good to see you, Mr. Douglas.

190
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:04,421
lt's always good
to see you too, Trey.

191
00:11:04,495 --> 00:11:05,689
We need to talk.

192
00:11:05,763 --> 00:11:07,162
Oh, yeah, sure thing.

193
00:11:07,232 --> 00:11:10,793
Um, Trey, make some room for Dad.

194
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,661
- Ow!
- Get up. C'mon. Jeez.

195
00:11:14,739 --> 00:11:16,900
- OK, OK.
- No, no, no, no. Not OK.

196
00:11:16,975 --> 00:11:19,409
We gotta get outta here.
We're leavin' right now.

197
00:11:19,477 --> 00:11:22,742
As a member of the Animal Rescue
Group, there are principles...

198
00:11:22,814 --> 00:11:24,907
You're a member of the 1 1th grade.

199
00:11:24,983 --> 00:11:27,850
lf you don't get out of here
right now, l'm gonna ground you.

200
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:31,184
Who's gonna enforce it?
You? You're never home.

201
00:11:31,256 --> 00:11:34,350
You're never gonna leave home
unless you leave here right now.

202
00:11:37,061 --> 00:11:39,052
[scoffs] Come on, Trey.

203
00:11:40,064 --> 00:11:41,463
lt was nice seeing you.

204
00:11:41,532 --> 00:11:43,193
You too, Trey.

205
00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:45,998
- [barks]
- OK.

206
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:49,301
Yeah, this one still
freaks me out. A lot.

207
00:11:49,374 --> 00:11:51,774
Can't make an omelet
without breakin' some eggs.

208
00:11:51,843 --> 00:11:54,311
- That's a good point.
- Let's get a sample.

209
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:55,641
OK.

210
00:11:55,713 --> 00:11:58,341
Such a good dog.

211
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:01,214
Never give us any trouble, do you?

212
00:12:04,289 --> 00:12:05,620
Nice.

213
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,622
Oh, my God, it's a trap.

214
00:12:13,698 --> 00:12:16,223
- [barking]
- Dogs don't set traps.

215
00:12:16,301 --> 00:12:18,997
Yeah, well, dogs
don't live 300 years either.

216
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:22,164
- [growling]
- [woman] Get the cattle prod.

217
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,071
OK. That's what l'm doing,

218
00:12:24,142 --> 00:12:26,770
backing up to get
the cattle prod. l have it.

219
00:12:26,844 --> 00:12:28,812
- [electricity crackling]
- [barking]

220
00:12:31,182 --> 00:12:32,444
[woman] Watch out.

221
00:12:32,517 --> 00:12:33,506
That blood's viral.

222
00:12:33,584 --> 00:12:34,915
Aah!

223
00:12:40,525 --> 00:12:43,688
He treats me like a ten-year-old.

224
00:12:43,761 --> 00:12:46,855
- What are you thinking?
- We can prove Mr. Forrester's right.

225
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:50,331
- You wanna sneak in?
- Just follow me.

226
00:12:54,672 --> 00:12:56,663
[snoring]

227
00:13:03,448 --> 00:13:04,745
lt's the middle of the day.

228
00:13:04,816 --> 00:13:07,250
lf anyone asks,
we're looking for a bathroom.

229
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,944
- [barks]
- [gasps]

230
00:13:10,021 --> 00:13:11,989
[grunts]

231
00:13:12,056 --> 00:13:14,752
- [Carly] l knew it.
- [barks]

232
00:13:16,494 --> 00:13:17,825
Let's go.

233
00:13:19,097 --> 00:13:20,394
[car engine starting]

234
00:13:23,701 --> 00:13:27,296
We proved Mr. Forrester's right.
They are testing animals in there.

235
00:13:27,372 --> 00:13:29,431
All right, so then,
what do we do now?

236
00:13:29,507 --> 00:13:34,103
We'll take him to the media
and show them we've got this dog...

237
00:13:34,178 --> 00:13:37,113
...who's got no tags or markings

238
00:13:37,181 --> 00:13:41,117
that we can actually prove
came from Grant & Strictland.

239
00:13:41,185 --> 00:13:43,312
Well, can we take him to your dad?

240
00:13:43,388 --> 00:13:44,980
Oh, yeah, sure.

241
00:13:45,056 --> 00:13:48,548
And, uh, as deputy DA,
he'll arrest us for burglary.

242
00:13:48,626 --> 00:13:50,685
[barks]

243
00:13:50,762 --> 00:13:53,595
- We've searched the building.
- We're gonna keep looking.

244
00:13:53,664 --> 00:13:55,131
- Really?
- We're gonna...

245
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,599
Same places or new places?
lf the same places...

246
00:13:57,668 --> 00:14:00,603
- l think new places.
- Oh, yeah? Tell me you're a moron.

247
00:14:00,671 --> 00:14:01,831
- Definitely.
- Larry.

248
00:14:01,906 --> 00:14:03,396
- Yes?
- Don't... don't speak.

249
00:14:03,474 --> 00:14:06,602
Do you understand the great lengths
l went to to get this dog? Yes?

250
00:14:06,677 --> 00:14:10,010
- Yes-or-no question.
- Well, you said not to speak...

251
00:14:10,081 --> 00:14:12,606
And just 'cause he holds
the key to my future...

252
00:14:12,683 --> 00:14:15,481
...so it would stand to reason
that if you don't find him,

253
00:14:15,553 --> 00:14:18,215
well, [chuckles]
you won't have a future.

254
00:14:18,289 --> 00:14:20,189
Right.

255
00:14:20,258 --> 00:14:21,953
Why are you still standing here?

256
00:14:22,026 --> 00:14:24,620
No sleeping. No talking. Find him.

257
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,257
[Dave] Hey, sorry l'm late, guys.

258
00:14:27,331 --> 00:14:29,561
- Where's my dinner?
- [all] ln the microwave.

259
00:14:29,634 --> 00:14:30,658
Right.

260
00:14:30,735 --> 00:14:33,169
So you guys see the trial
on the evening news?

261
00:14:34,705 --> 00:14:37,435
Great shot of your dad
on channel eight. [chuckles]

262
00:14:37,508 --> 00:14:40,773
So how was the parent-teacher
conference today?

263
00:14:40,845 --> 00:14:42,369
[water running]

264
00:14:42,447 --> 00:14:43,641
[sighs]

265
00:14:44,649 --> 00:14:45,741
l'm sorry. l'm sorry.

266
00:14:45,817 --> 00:14:49,150
l... [sighs] Completely slipped my...

267
00:14:50,621 --> 00:14:52,486
[whimpers]

268
00:14:52,557 --> 00:14:55,549
There's a dog in the kitchen.

269
00:14:55,626 --> 00:14:58,220
No, no, no, no. lt's a dog-free home.

270
00:14:58,296 --> 00:15:00,230
[Carly] Dad, stop oppressing Shaggy!

271
00:15:00,298 --> 00:15:02,664
- He's got a name now?
- Yeah, it just happened.

272
00:15:02,733 --> 00:15:04,462
He's so cute, and he's very smart.

273
00:15:04,535 --> 00:15:06,662
They're a breeding ground for fleas.

274
00:15:06,737 --> 00:15:10,138
They don't contribute to the financial
well-being of a household.

275
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:11,698
And l'm not gonna get... Oh!

276
00:15:11,776 --> 00:15:14,745
lt was an accident. He's really sweet
once you get to know him.

277
00:15:14,812 --> 00:15:16,575
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, l'm OK.

278
00:15:16,647 --> 00:15:19,639
Carly, this is precisely why,
no matter what happens,

279
00:15:19,717 --> 00:15:22,208
that animal's goin' back
to wherever he came from.

280
00:15:23,688 --> 00:15:25,315
[dog whimpering]

281
00:15:25,389 --> 00:15:28,017
Look at that. He's paper-trained.

282
00:15:29,494 --> 00:15:31,928
All right, um, come here. Ow!

283
00:15:31,996 --> 00:15:33,361
Oh! Aah!

284
00:15:33,431 --> 00:15:35,695
[echoing]

285
00:15:47,512 --> 00:15:49,104
Ow!

286
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,909
- You scared him.
- Ow, he bit me.

287
00:15:50,982 --> 00:15:53,177
- [mother] Let me see.
- [Dave grunts]

288
00:15:53,251 --> 00:15:56,778
[Carly] Aww. He's licking it better.
What could be more sweet?

289
00:15:56,854 --> 00:15:59,880
So no hard feelings, right?

290
00:15:59,957 --> 00:16:02,323
- [pants]
- Thanks, guys.

291
00:16:02,393 --> 00:16:04,588
[Josh] He licked you!
He tried to apologize!

292
00:16:04,662 --> 00:16:07,529
You know what? A lick is not
considered an apology.

293
00:16:07,598 --> 00:16:10,328
Well, if he doesn't have rabies,
can we take him back?

294
00:16:13,337 --> 00:16:14,668
[grunts]

295
00:16:16,574 --> 00:16:19,338
- [sighs]
- Hey.

296
00:16:20,545 --> 00:16:22,410
How's your hand?

297
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,345
[slurring] Uh, fine, thanks.

298
00:16:26,817 --> 00:16:29,684
- What?
- Why are you talkin' like that?

299
00:16:29,754 --> 00:16:32,746
l don't... [stammers]

300
00:16:32,823 --> 00:16:35,155
l don't know. Huh.

301
00:16:35,226 --> 00:16:39,686
So Josh's teacher called me today
at work when you didn't show.

302
00:16:39,764 --> 00:16:41,664
l am so sorry about that.

303
00:16:41,732 --> 00:16:43,700
He's flunking math.

304
00:16:43,768 --> 00:16:45,099
You're kidding.

305
00:16:45,169 --> 00:16:48,605
Josh knows he can't play football
unless he passes math.

306
00:16:48,673 --> 00:16:51,642
l'll... l'll...
Don't worry, l'll... l'll...

307
00:16:51,709 --> 00:16:55,201
l'll... l'll talk to him or somethin'.

308
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,770
She also asked if there
were any problems at home.

309
00:16:57,848 --> 00:17:00,112
Yeah, that's good.

310
00:17:00,918 --> 00:17:03,386
l told her that we'd
reverted to cannibalism

311
00:17:03,454 --> 00:17:05,684
and that we were eating
our neighbors.

312
00:17:05,756 --> 00:17:08,122
OK, great. l'd say the same thing.

313
00:17:13,998 --> 00:17:15,124
What?

314
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,099
What happened to my husband?

315
00:17:17,168 --> 00:17:19,432
Let's not exaggerate the situation.

316
00:17:19,503 --> 00:17:20,765
Dave!

317
00:17:20,838 --> 00:17:24,399
You were bitten tonight by a stray dog,
and the kids took the dog's side.

318
00:17:24,475 --> 00:17:28,138
What does that tell you? You don't know
what's going on with your children.

319
00:17:28,212 --> 00:17:30,146
You don't know
what's going on with me.

320
00:17:30,214 --> 00:17:32,512
When was the last time
you said, ''l love you''?

321
00:17:33,684 --> 00:17:35,652
l love you.

322
00:17:36,687 --> 00:17:38,746
That doesn't count.

323
00:17:38,823 --> 00:17:40,791
Rebecca. Wait a minute. Rebecca, stop.

324
00:17:40,858 --> 00:17:43,088
Stop for a second. Please, look.

325
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,253
That didn't come out right.
Turn around.

326
00:17:45,329 --> 00:17:47,763
Look, sit down, sit down.

327
00:17:47,832 --> 00:17:49,595
l got an idea. l got an idea.

328
00:17:49,667 --> 00:17:51,794
Tomorrow night
l'm gonna come home early,

329
00:17:51,869 --> 00:17:55,498
l'm gonna cook dinner for the kids,
spend some quality time with them.

330
00:17:55,573 --> 00:17:57,302
You know what the next night is.

331
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:00,435
- Do you?
- Yes. lt's our anniversary.

332
00:18:00,511 --> 00:18:05,448
So we make reservations at Grace,

333
00:18:05,516 --> 00:18:08,349
get that table
by the window that we love.

334
00:18:08,419 --> 00:18:12,321
l'll sing in French,
like you know that l can't do.

335
00:18:14,592 --> 00:18:17,959
You have to do more
than just talk a good game.

336
00:18:18,029 --> 00:18:20,589
- You have to follow through, OK?
- Yeah.

337
00:18:20,665 --> 00:18:23,133
You have to connect
with the whole family again.

338
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,395
[whispering] l love you.

339

00:29:58,562 --> 00:30:00,826
- Hey there.
- How'd you get out?

510
00:30:00,897 --> 00:30:02,489
Well, you let me in here.

511
00:30:02,566 --> 00:30:05,535
Wow. You're taller than l remember.

512
00:30:05,602 --> 00:30:07,968
- What are you doin' with that stick?
- Come here!

513
00:30:08,038 --> 00:30:10,029
- [Dave] Hey!
- [ripping]

514
00:30:11,708 --> 00:30:13,505
Uh-oh.

515
00:30:13,577 --> 00:30:16,307
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

516
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:19,178
Why am l runnin' on all fours?
Thank you.

517
00:30:19,249 --> 00:30:21,513
Man, am l flyin'!

518
00:30:21,585 --> 00:30:24,418
Why'd l ever run on two?

519
00:30:24,488 --> 00:30:25,853
This is weird.

520
00:30:25,922 --> 00:30:28,652
[stammers] What's hittin' me
in the face? What is that?

521
00:30:28,725 --> 00:30:31,125
- lt's my tongue.
- [tongue smacking]

522
00:30:31,194 --> 00:30:34,061
l can taste my own eyeball.

523
00:30:36,933 --> 00:30:39,265
- Aw, man.
- Hi there.

524
00:30:41,338 --> 00:30:42,737
Hoping you can help us.

525
00:30:42,806 --> 00:30:46,537
Um, our dog wandered off.

526
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,543
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

527
00:30:51,615 --> 00:30:54,015
Back the truck up.

528
00:30:54,084 --> 00:30:56,052
Look at that.

529
00:30:56,119 --> 00:31:00,055
That's that new 42-inch plasma.

530
00:31:00,123 --> 00:31:01,613
What is that?

531
00:31:02,626 --> 00:31:04,025
ls that me?

532
00:31:04,094 --> 00:31:07,461
lt's impossible. That can't be me.

533
00:31:07,531 --> 00:31:09,465
[barks] l'm barking now?

534
00:31:09,533 --> 00:31:12,058
Did someone knock me out
and put me in a dog costume?

535
00:31:12,135 --> 00:31:15,127
Right. 'Cause that happens
all the time.

536
00:31:15,205 --> 00:31:17,298
l get it.

537
00:31:17,374 --> 00:31:19,968
l'm, uh... l'm dreaming. Yeah.

538
00:31:20,043 --> 00:31:22,978
ln about five seconds,
l'll be naked in the courtroom.

539
00:31:23,046 --> 00:31:26,243
[barks] l've gotta wake myself up.

540
00:31:26,316 --> 00:31:28,216
Yeah. Wake myself up.

541
00:31:28,285 --> 00:31:29,377
Oh!

542
00:31:29,453 --> 00:31:32,820
[groans] That hurt.

543
00:31:32,889 --> 00:31:36,052
So l'm not dreaming,
l'm not in a dog costume,

544
00:31:36,126 --> 00:31:39,186
which can only mean one thing.
l'm a dog.

545
00:31:39,262 --> 00:31:41,753
[barks] Weirder things have happened.

546
00:31:41,832 --> 00:31:44,494
l am a dog! [echoing]

547
00:31:44,568 --> 00:31:48,595
Perfectly understandable,
everybody. l'm a dog!

548
00:31:48,672 --> 00:31:51,402
l am a dog!

549
00:31:53,276 --> 00:31:56,370
- [man] ls this him?
- [Larry] That is him. That is him.

550
00:31:56,446 --> 00:31:58,107
You are a lifesaver. Thank you.

551
00:31:58,181 --> 00:32:01,344
- [Gwen] Mm-hmm.
- Our kids have been crying all day.

552
00:32:01,418 --> 00:32:03,283
- [both] Aww.
- Can we take him now?

553
00:32:03,353 --> 00:32:05,651
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah. Right now.

554
00:32:07,891 --> 00:32:10,951
[Dave] Please be home,
please be home, please be home.

555
00:32:11,027 --> 00:32:13,860
[barks] Hey, Tom, hey, Mary. Tom? Mary?

556
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:16,956
Please be home, please be home,
please be home, please be home.

557
00:32:17,033 --> 00:32:19,501
[panting] There we go. All right!

558
00:32:22,072 --> 00:32:24,199
[barking]

559
00:32:25,475 --> 00:32:27,238
What's going on? l can't open this.

560
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:29,540
Come on, Dave,
grab and turn, grab and turn.

561
00:32:31,181 --> 00:32:33,581
How do dogs do anything with these?

562
00:32:34,985 --> 00:32:36,976
[doorbell rings]

563
00:32:38,088 --> 00:32:39,988
- [barks] Hi!
- Shaggy, you're back!

564
00:32:40,056 --> 00:32:42,854
No, l'm... l'm not Shaggy. l'm Dad.

565
00:32:42,926 --> 00:32:46,191
Carly, you gotta help me.
Must've been that dog bite.

566
00:32:46,263 --> 00:32:48,891
When the dog bit me,
l turned into Shaggy.

567
00:32:48,965 --> 00:32:51,195
- [laughs]
- Why is that funny?

568
00:32:51,268 --> 00:32:53,065
Gosh, you're talkative, aren't you?

569
00:32:53,136 --> 00:32:55,900
Oh, that feels good. That feels good.

570
00:32:55,972 --> 00:32:58,133
Oh, you're so cute.
l know. How ya doin'?

571
00:32:58,208 --> 00:33:01,109
Oh, wow. That is so good.

572
00:33:01,177 --> 00:33:03,577
But wait! Wait, wait, wait!
This is important!

573
00:33:03,647 --> 00:33:04,841
Hey, it's Shaggy!

574
00:33:04,915 --> 00:33:06,746
- Where'd he come from?
- l don't know.

575
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:08,249
No, no, no, no, no.

576
00:33:08,318 --> 00:33:10,878
No, no. Listen to me.
Listen. l'm your dad.

577
00:33:10,954 --> 00:33:12,046
[Josh chuckles]

578
00:33:12,122 --> 00:33:14,488
Wow, he's really hyper today.

579
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:17,755
[through barks] l am your dad.

580
00:33:17,827 --> 00:33:20,421
[Carly] Hey, do you need
to do your business?

581
00:33:20,497 --> 00:33:24,058
Business? Did my daughter just ask me
if l wanted to use the bathroom?

582
00:33:24,134 --> 00:33:26,068
Wait a minute. They can't hear me.

583
00:33:26,136 --> 00:33:28,070
All they hear is barking.

584
00:33:29,139 --> 00:33:30,697
l got an idea. Here. Over here.

585
00:33:30,774 --> 00:33:32,435
Follow me.

586
00:33:36,846 --> 00:33:39,041
Watch, you guys. Let's see. l... l am...

587
00:33:39,115 --> 00:33:41,049
Shaggy, no! Bad doggy!

588
00:33:41,117 --> 00:33:43,176
l am Dad. l am Dad.

589
00:33:43,253 --> 00:33:44,515
l need a ''D.'' A ''D''...

590
00:33:44,588 --> 00:33:46,419
- Shaggy, stop.
- What are you doing?

591
00:33:46,489 --> 00:33:50,789
[Dave] Stop. What are you doing?
Quit cleanin' up!

592
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:53,954
Sixteen years, not once have you
tried to clean up your room.

593
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:57,329
But when Dad turns into a dog,
you're there cleanin' everything up.

594
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,664
- That's Janey. l gotta go.
- Where you goin'?

595
00:33:59,736 --> 00:34:01,203
You won't tell Mom and Dad?

596
00:34:01,271 --> 00:34:03,535
- Yeah.
- [Dave] Don't like the sound of this.

597
00:34:03,607 --> 00:34:06,303
- l'm getting a tattoo.
- [Dave] What?

598
00:34:06,376 --> 00:34:08,867
Janey knows this place
where they don't ask for lD.

599
00:34:08,945 --> 00:34:12,073
l'm gonna get the Animal Rescue
Group logo tattooed across...

600
00:34:12,148 --> 00:34:14,480
- l don't think so!
- Shaggy, where are you going?

601
00:34:14,551 --> 00:34:16,917
Hey, Carly, hurry up!

602
00:34:16,987 --> 00:34:19,922
Oh! Who's the cute doggy?

603
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:21,890
Who's the...? [stammers] Whoa, boy.

604
00:34:21,958 --> 00:34:23,550
[Janey] Whoa, boy. Whoa, boy.

605
00:34:23,627 --> 00:34:25,595
- [Dave growling]
- Whoa, boy! Whoa!

606
00:34:25,662 --> 00:34:27,994
[screaming]

607
00:34:29,366 --> 00:34:32,301
- Shaggy, don't!
- [Dave] Janey! Janey! Listen to me!

608
00:34:32,369 --> 00:34:34,496
How could you do this?
You're a good girl!

609
00:34:34,571 --> 00:34:36,732
You went to church camp!

610
00:34:36,806 --> 00:34:39,138
[tires squealing]

611
00:34:41,645 --> 00:34:44,808
Shaggy, what's gotten into you?
Bad dog!

612
00:34:44,881 --> 00:34:46,644
Don't use that tone with me.

613
00:34:46,716 --> 00:34:49,810
You're grounded, young lady.
You are grounded.

614
00:34:49,886 --> 00:34:52,286
- He's kind of freaking me out a little.
- What?

615
00:34:52,355 --> 00:34:54,448
Maybe we should take him
back to the pound.

616
00:34:54,524 --> 00:34:56,651
No, no, no, no, no, no. l'll be good.

617
00:34:56,726 --> 00:34:59,286
Look, l'm good! Look at this.
Hey, look how good l am.

618
00:34:59,362 --> 00:35:00,761
Look who's a good doggy.

619
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:02,764
- [laughs]
- This is humiliating.

620
00:35:02,832 --> 00:35:05,198
He probably just needs
to run around a little.

621
00:35:05,268 --> 00:35:07,634
l ran five miles to get here.
l don't need a run.

622
00:35:07,704 --> 00:35:09,331
l'll take him to the dog park.

623
00:35:09,406 --> 00:35:13,968
No, l have stuff to do, important stuff.
l'm not going to a dog park.

624
00:35:14,044 --> 00:35:16,035
- [sniffing]
- [barking in distance]

625
00:35:23,486 --> 00:35:27,479
ls there anyone in this entire park
who has not sniffed my butt?

626
00:35:27,557 --> 00:35:31,049
No, no, no. Thanks, l don't wanna
sniff your butt. Maybe later.

627
00:35:31,127 --> 00:35:33,061
l just want some answers.

628
00:35:33,129 --> 00:35:37,088
Has anybody here ever heard
of a human being turning into a...?

629
00:35:37,167 --> 00:35:38,998
- [Josh] Hey, Shaggy, hey!
- What?

630
00:35:39,069 --> 00:35:42,470
- Wanna play with the Frisbee?
- Josh, l am not playing Fris...

631
00:35:42,539 --> 00:35:43,870
l got it!

632
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:49,505
- Yes! l nailed it!
- Awesome!

633
00:35:51,314 --> 00:35:53,646
- Josh.
- Oh, hey, Tracy. How's it goin'?

634
00:35:53,717 --> 00:35:56,049
- Where were you today?
- What do you mean?

635
00:35:56,119 --> 00:35:58,087
<i>Auditions for Grease.</i>

636
00:35:58,154 --> 00:36:01,055
[Dave] That instinct is really intense.
lt's like insane.

637
00:36:01,124 --> 00:36:03,024
Hey, l got a dog. Pretty cool, huh?

638
00:36:03,093 --> 00:36:05,527
Here you go. Keep the Frisbee.
l'll be right back.

639
00:36:05,595 --> 00:36:07,563
l gotta talk to those other... l got it!

640
00:36:09,532 --> 00:36:10,999
Nothin' but mouth!

641
00:36:11,067 --> 00:36:13,433
l'm not doin' the musical this fall.

642
00:36:13,503 --> 00:36:16,666
- What?
- l, you know, just don't wanna.

643
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:19,334
[mock laughs] Funny. You're cute.

644
00:36:19,409 --> 00:36:22,401
Be at the theater tomorrow, 3:00.

645
00:36:23,346 --> 00:36:25,405
And, uh, don't get too cocky.

646
00:36:25,482 --> 00:36:27,473
Just 'cause you're the best

647
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:29,541
doesn't mean you're
gonna get the part.

648
00:36:30,653 --> 00:36:32,917
- Ow.
- [woman] Come on, kids!

649
00:36:32,989 --> 00:36:36,220
Did you see that catch?
That was great. Way up in the air...

650
00:36:36,292 --> 00:36:38,260
- Hey, what's the matter?
- [Josh sighs]

651
00:36:53,209 --> 00:36:55,177
[barks, whimpers]

652
00:36:55,245 --> 00:36:58,180
You were a very bad dog.

653
00:36:58,248 --> 00:37:00,239
Are you gonna be a good boy?

654
00:37:04,053 --> 00:37:06,988
You get the cattle prod,
l'll get the needle.

655
00:37:07,056 --> 00:37:08,045
OK.

656
00:37:12,529 --> 00:37:14,190
[barking]

657
00:37:22,605 --> 00:37:23,799
[door opens]

658
00:37:23,873 --> 00:37:25,431
When was Dad supposed to be home?

659
00:37:25,508 --> 00:37:27,271
- [door closes]
- 'Bout an hour ago.

660
00:37:28,511 --> 00:37:30,240
Hey, honey.

661
00:37:30,313 --> 00:37:32,577
Remember that
''in sickness and health'' thing?

662
00:37:32,649 --> 00:37:33,946
[Josh] What's for dinner?

663
00:37:34,017 --> 00:37:36,315
Well, your father
was supposed to be cooking.

664
00:37:36,386 --> 00:37:39,583
At least he said he was, last time
he returned one of my phone calls.

665
00:37:39,656 --> 00:37:41,817
[Dave] Oh, boy,
that's the mad face.

666
00:37:41,891 --> 00:37:44,291
You smell mad. Are you in heat?

667
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,191
[Carly] Did you check your e-mail?

668
00:37:46,262 --> 00:37:48,594
The computer. That's it. That's it!

669
00:37:48,665 --> 00:37:50,428
- [chuckles] All right.
- Shaggy!

670
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,297
Where are you going?

671
00:37:59,843 --> 00:38:04,303
- [Dave] OK, um, l can't make dinner...
- [Carly] Shaggy, stop causing trouble.

672
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,473
What's a shorter word
for metamorphosis?

673
00:38:06,549 --> 00:38:08,642
All right. Look, l can't make dinner...

674
00:38:08,718 --> 00:38:12,347
l can't make dinner because
l turned into a d... Don't shut that!

675
00:38:12,422 --> 00:38:14,413
Hey, watch this.

676
00:38:15,592 --> 00:38:17,583
Who does this remind you of?

677
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:19,628
Wow. Maybe he escaped
from the circus.

678
00:38:19,696 --> 00:38:21,129
- [chuckles]
- C'mon, kids.

679
00:38:21,197 --> 00:38:24,064
Try to see past the fur and the tail,
the snout and the drool.

680
00:38:24,133 --> 00:38:26,465
[chuckles] How cute.

681
00:38:26,536 --> 00:38:29,664
Honey, you recognize me. Honey?

682
00:38:29,739 --> 00:38:31,866
Do you think your dad
is gonna come through,

683
00:38:31,941 --> 00:38:35,240
- or should we go ahead and order in?
- [in unison] Let's order in.

684
00:38:35,879 --> 00:38:37,540
Ouch.

685
00:38:40,884 --> 00:38:43,819
Well, l would let you
sleep inside, Shaggy.

686
00:38:43,887 --> 00:38:46,754
But my husband won't allow it.

687
00:38:46,823 --> 00:38:48,688
Now, there's a bitter irony.

688
00:38:48,758 --> 00:38:50,020
Good night.

689
00:38:50,093 --> 00:38:53,062
Wait. Wait. Honey? [barking]

690
00:38:53,129 --> 00:38:55,063
l'm sorry about tonight.

691
00:38:55,131 --> 00:38:57,224
l love you. [growls]

692
00:39:01,037 --> 00:39:02,197
Sweet dreams.

693
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:09,701
Really do love you.

694
00:39:14,784 --> 00:39:17,116
[heartbeat thumping]

695
00:40:18,648 --> 00:40:20,639
[floor creaking]

696
00:40:23,653 --> 00:40:25,985
- lt's 3am.
- [clears throat]

697
00:40:26,055 --> 00:40:28,785
Where have you been?
What happened to your clothes?

698
00:40:28,858 --> 00:40:33,192
Clearly you're upset,
and l would be upset too. But there's...

699
00:40:33,262 --> 00:40:36,459
There's a simple but hard-to-swallow
explanation for all this.

700
00:40:36,532 --> 00:40:39,524
[sighs] l turned into a dog.

701
00:40:40,403 --> 00:40:41,734
[chuckles]

702
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,705
Lori, l wanna thank you

703
00:40:52,782 --> 00:40:55,808
for picking up my car
at the animal shelter.

704
00:40:55,885 --> 00:40:58,319
l figured you were
getting it fixed. [chuckles]

705
00:40:58,388 --> 00:41:01,357
- Ooh.
- Um, no thanks necessary.

706
00:41:01,424 --> 00:41:03,756
Anything else
l can do for you this morning?

707
00:41:03,826 --> 00:41:07,091
- Actually, l need some research done.
- Oh, OK. Great. On what?

708
00:41:07,163 --> 00:41:09,791
On dogs and man.
Man and dog... [stammers]

709
00:41:09,866 --> 00:41:13,461
Have you ever heard
of a man turning into a dog?

710
00:41:13,536 --> 00:41:17,199
They all do eventually, don't they?
[laughing]

711
00:41:17,273 --> 00:41:19,036
You've been drinking, haven't you?

712
00:41:19,108 --> 00:41:21,975
Dog-men. l'm on it.
Um, do you mind if l ask why?

713
00:41:22,045 --> 00:41:24,775
- lt would be better if you didn't.
- Right, OK.

714
00:41:26,082 --> 00:41:28,573
l'll be honest,
the reports of your behavior

715
00:41:28,651 --> 00:41:30,516
in court yesterday were unsettling.

716
00:41:30,586 --> 00:41:33,646
As was your disappearing
the rest of the day.

717
00:41:33,723 --> 00:41:36,317
Yeah, l know. And l'm...
l'm sorry about that.

718
00:41:36,392 --> 00:41:38,121
l had some kind of food poisoning.

719
00:41:38,194 --> 00:41:40,719
- l was mildly delirious.
- [elevator bell dings]

720
00:41:42,065 --> 00:41:43,726
- You goin' down?
- Yeah.

721
00:41:45,068 --> 00:41:47,593
- [sighs]
- Hold it.

722
00:41:54,077 --> 00:41:56,068
[growls]

723
00:41:56,145 --> 00:41:58,739
Should've taken the stairs.

724
00:41:58,815 --> 00:42:00,749
- But you're fine now.
- Huh? Yeah, yeah.

725
00:42:00,817 --> 00:42:02,614
l'm great now, thanks, Ken.

726
00:42:02,685 --> 00:42:04,619
- [dog whimpers]
- [Ken] Good.

727
00:42:04,687 --> 00:42:07,087
Because people don't
want a loose cannon

728
00:42:07,156 --> 00:42:09,090
workin' the DA's office.

729
00:42:10,326 --> 00:42:13,386
- Jeez.
- [dog whimpering]

730
00:42:13,463 --> 00:42:16,296
- [growling]
- [gasps]

731
00:42:18,501 --> 00:42:20,992
You ain't got anything illegal
up there, do you?

732
00:42:22,371 --> 00:42:25,067
[laughing]

733
00:42:28,244 --> 00:42:29,836
[growling]

734
00:42:29,912 --> 00:42:31,777
By the way, Lloyd Gannon called today

735
00:42:31,848 --> 00:42:34,908
about working on some
preliminary campaign ideas.

736
00:42:35,685 --> 00:42:37,016
Sit.

737
00:42:38,121 --> 00:42:40,385
He wants to go grassroots to start.

738
00:42:40,456 --> 00:42:42,048
Mailers, some door hangers,

739
00:42:42,125 --> 00:42:44,286
- work up to television and radio.
- Mm-hmm.

740
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,920
[whimpering, growling]

741
00:42:48,998 --> 00:42:50,795
[clears throat]

742
00:42:50,867 --> 00:42:53,267
- You OK?
- Yeah, yeah.

743
00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:56,602
Yeah. [sighs]

744
00:42:58,007 --> 00:43:00,339
[panting]

745
00:43:01,611 --> 00:43:04,307
[mumbling] Oh...

746
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:06,075
[pants]

747
00:43:06,149 --> 00:43:07,878
[elevator bell dings]

748
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:13,580
You sure you're OK
to go into court today?

749
00:43:13,656 --> 00:43:16,352
Yeah. Uh-huh.

750
00:43:19,095 --> 00:43:20,756
[pants]

751
00:43:23,499 --> 00:43:24,989
[gurgles] Oh.

752
00:43:25,067 --> 00:43:27,297
There were these little bunnies.

753
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:31,033
There... there were poor
little fluffy bunnies

754
00:43:31,107 --> 00:43:33,041
all crammed together in a cage.

755
00:43:33,109 --> 00:43:35,475
[Dave] You thought it was
a good idea to set a fire

756
00:43:35,545 --> 00:43:37,410
where there was bunnies present?

757
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:39,607
- Objection.
- [judge] Overruled.

758
00:43:39,682 --> 00:43:42,446
Look, l didn't set the fire,
and l saw what l saw.

759
00:43:42,518 --> 00:43:44,110
We can't see what you saw?

760
00:43:44,187 --> 00:43:47,122
Do we need special goggles?
ls this like a Bigfoot affair?

761
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:49,522
Objection! He's badgering the witness!

762
00:43:49,592 --> 00:43:54,552
- Your Honor!
- l saw a monkey who acted like a dog!

763
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:56,393
[courtroom laughing]

764
00:43:56,465 --> 00:43:58,660
[judge] Counselors, approach the bench.

765
00:44:00,937 --> 00:44:02,632
[Dave sniffs]

766
00:44:02,705 --> 00:44:04,696
[judge] Get over here!

767
00:44:08,945 --> 00:44:13,382
Don't you dare turn
my courtroom into a barnyard.

768
00:44:15,551 --> 00:44:17,314
Get your chin off my desk.

769
00:44:17,386 --> 00:44:19,820
- [whimpers]
- Go on. Go on.

770
00:44:22,491 --> 00:44:25,824
l assume you're going somewhere
with this line of questioning?

771
00:44:25,895 --> 00:44:27,294
l'd like a treat first.

772
00:44:28,264 --> 00:44:31,256
Yes, yes, l was. Thank you.

773
00:44:31,334 --> 00:44:34,394
- [judge] Proceed, counsel.
- [Dave] Thank you, Your Honor.

774
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:36,438
How did this monkey act like a dog?

775
00:44:36,505 --> 00:44:38,837
lt was growling and chasing its tail.

776
00:44:38,908 --> 00:44:40,933
[laughter]

777
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:43,808
[Dave] Was there anything else
that was genetically odd?

778
00:44:43,879 --> 00:44:47,007
There was a snake
with a tail like a dog.

779
00:44:47,083 --> 00:44:49,210
- [laughter]
- [gavel pounds]

780
00:44:49,285 --> 00:44:51,776
And rats. Rats that barked.

781
00:44:52,955 --> 00:44:55,617
- [judge pounds gavel]
- [Forrester] lt's true!

782
00:44:56,759 --> 00:44:58,090
Look, it's true!

783
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,628
l'm... l'm not lying! l'm not crazy!

784
00:45:00,696 --> 00:45:03,221
[judge] Order! Order!

785
00:45:05,134 --> 00:45:09,195
This dog that you saw,
what did it look like?

786
00:45:09,272 --> 00:45:14,710
lt was a big, woolly sheepdog.

787
00:45:22,218 --> 00:45:25,051
- No further questions, Your Honor.
- Thank God.

788
00:45:25,121 --> 00:45:27,453
- [judge] Court adjourned.
- [pounds gavel]

789
00:45:30,826 --> 00:45:31,986
[bell ringing]

790
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:34,654
Josh was one
of my best math students,

791
00:45:34,729 --> 00:45:37,459
and then, all of a sudden... [whistles]

792
00:45:37,532 --> 00:45:39,193
Bad grades.

793
00:45:39,267 --> 00:45:42,862
And so we're just trying
to search out an explanation, really.

794
00:45:42,938 --> 00:45:45,839
Well, l think the problem
is he's distracted by football.

795
00:45:45,907 --> 00:45:49,502
Can l...? l think l know what the
problem... The problem, l think, is me.

796
00:45:49,578 --> 00:45:52,240
l've been workin' too much.
This is what this is about.

797
00:45:52,314 --> 00:45:53,747
l haven't been home. lt's...

798
00:45:53,815 --> 00:45:56,340
lt's been causing a lot
of stress on my family.

799
00:45:56,418 --> 00:45:59,683
[teacher] Well, l know what it's like
to be too busy to do anything.

800
00:45:59,754 --> 00:46:01,813
ln fact, l didn't even get to eat lunch.

801
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:04,859
- Do you mind if l eat something?
- [chuckles] Sure.

802
00:46:04,926 --> 00:46:06,359
- [Dave] Go ahead.
- Thanks.

803
00:46:06,428 --> 00:46:08,794
l realized this in court, actually.

804
00:46:08,864 --> 00:46:12,732
Uh, last couple days the...
the amount that l was in...

805
00:46:15,537 --> 00:46:17,528
[sniffing]

806
00:46:19,341 --> 00:46:22,868
Can you smell that?
lt is so smelly in a great way.

807
00:46:22,944 --> 00:46:24,878
That is... [echoing] turkey...

808
00:46:24,946 --> 00:46:27,244
- [lettuce crunching]
- [echoing] Mmm.

809
00:46:27,315 --> 00:46:31,445
Look at that. Ah, yeah.

810
00:46:32,387 --> 00:46:34,184
- [teacher] Do you want half?
- Hmm?

811
00:46:34,256 --> 00:46:35,450
C'mon, please?

812
00:46:36,658 --> 00:46:38,353
Uh, no. Well, no, wait, no.

813
00:46:38,426 --> 00:46:40,917
No, we're here to talk about Josh.

814
00:46:40,996 --> 00:46:43,328
Boy. Anyway,

815
00:46:43,398 --> 00:46:44,956
l'm gonna commit myself to this.

816
00:46:45,033 --> 00:46:47,194
There's nothing more
important than Josh.

817
00:46:47,269 --> 00:46:51,035
Nothing more important to me... Nothing
more important to me than family.

818
00:46:51,106 --> 00:46:53,097
- [smacks lips]
- [teacher] That's true.

819
00:46:53,174 --> 00:46:55,870
Oh, that's great.
l love hearing that. [chuckles]

820
00:46:55,944 --> 00:46:59,038
- As a teacher, l love to hear...
- [hisses]

821
00:46:59,114 --> 00:47:01,639
- Honey?
- [door closing, running]

822
00:47:01,716 --> 00:47:04,549
[stammers] l'm so sorry. [laughs]

823
00:47:04,619 --> 00:47:06,712
l mean, he's really a wonderful father.

824
00:47:06,788 --> 00:47:09,052
You know, we just have
a very normal lifestyle.

825
00:47:09,124 --> 00:47:11,456
- Yeah, it just seems that way.
- [cat yowling]

826
00:47:11,526 --> 00:47:12,720

00:49:17,252 --> 00:49:18,742
- [cat meows]
- What?

847
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:20,583
[yowls]

848
00:49:20,655 --> 00:49:23,590
Well, if ya didn't do anything wrong,
why were you running?

849
00:49:24,726 --> 00:49:28,321
[laughs] Serves you right...
[grunts] Oh!

850
00:49:29,064 --> 00:49:30,793
Gotcha.

851
00:49:30,865 --> 00:49:32,856
This is just not my week.

852
00:49:32,934 --> 00:49:34,265
[whimpers]

853
00:49:41,209 --> 00:49:42,267
l think we've got it.

854
00:49:42,343 --> 00:49:45,335
This rabbit was injected
with the serum two days ago.

855
00:49:45,413 --> 00:49:46,402
[Kozak] Uh-huh.

856
00:49:46,481 --> 00:49:49,712
So far cell degeneration
has ceased with no side effects.

857
00:49:51,219 --> 00:49:52,709
- You're sure?
- l'm sure.

858
00:49:52,787 --> 00:49:54,880
Are you absolutely, entirely certain?

859
00:49:54,956 --> 00:49:56,287
Absolutely.

860
00:49:57,625 --> 00:49:59,616
- l've done it.
- Um, we've done it.

861
00:49:59,694 --> 00:50:02,561
l've done it! [laughs]
l'm gonna call Strictland.

862
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:05,565
l bet he's gonna want an injection
of this stuff right away.

863
00:50:05,633 --> 00:50:07,260
Can we do that? lsn't there an FDA?

864
00:50:07,335 --> 00:50:10,463
The man's got one lung and
someone else's kidney. He'll risk it.

865
00:50:10,538 --> 00:50:13,473
Gwen, l want you to manufacture
as much serum as you can.

866
00:50:13,541 --> 00:50:16,476
Don't worry about the FDA.
lt's nothing money can't handle.

867
00:50:16,544 --> 00:50:17,738
[laughing]

868
00:50:17,812 --> 00:50:19,905
[dogs barking]

869
00:50:19,981 --> 00:50:22,643
- That's him.
- [Dave] Kids! Am l glad to see you.

870
00:50:22,717 --> 00:50:26,551
This mastiff just sold me
for three biscuits.

871
00:50:26,621 --> 00:50:29,385
Where you been? We've been
lookin' all over for you, boy.

872
00:50:29,457 --> 00:50:32,153
l've been waitin' for you guys
to come get me outta here.

873
00:50:32,227 --> 00:50:34,923
[Josh] Let's go.
l got a football game to go to.

874
00:50:34,996 --> 00:50:37,260
[Dave] There's a game today? Wow!

875
00:50:37,332 --> 00:50:40,301
l... l get to watch you play.
That'll be great.

876
00:50:40,368 --> 00:50:40,468
[crowd cheering]

877
00:50:40,468 --> 00:50:41,400
[crowd cheering]

878
00:50:41,469 --> 00:50:43,198
- Get him!
- C'mon.

879
00:50:43,271 --> 00:50:46,570
- Hit him! Hit him!
- [referee blows whistle]

880
00:50:46,641 --> 00:50:49,576
[man] That's the way to hit somebody,
Jenkins. Way to go.

881
00:50:49,644 --> 00:50:52,169
[Dave barking]

882
00:50:52,247 --> 00:50:54,238
[Dave] Hey, coach,
would ya put my kid in?

883
00:50:54,315 --> 00:50:56,510
We waited all game for this.

884
00:50:56,584 --> 00:50:58,347
Douglas!

885
00:50:58,419 --> 00:50:59,647
You're in at tailback.

886
00:50:59,721 --> 00:51:01,416
[players laughing]

887
00:51:01,489 --> 00:51:03,480
lt's OK, coach.
You don't have to play me.

888
00:51:03,558 --> 00:51:06,925
- [Dave] What?
- Everybody plays, Douglas. Come on.

889
00:51:06,995 --> 00:51:09,122
But with the game
on the line and all...

890
00:51:09,197 --> 00:51:11,995
We're up by 30. Now let's go.

891
00:51:12,066 --> 00:51:13,931
- [woman] C'mon, buddy!
- All right.

892
00:51:14,002 --> 00:51:16,971
[Dave] Get in. Come on.
Come on, buddy. Get in there. C'mon.

893
00:51:17,038 --> 00:51:19,165
[grunts] Oh! Sorry, coach.

894
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:20,798
That's what l gotta deal with.

895
00:51:20,875 --> 00:51:23,366
[Dave] Show 'em what you can do.

896
00:51:23,444 --> 00:51:25,844
The other team's afraid. l can smell it!

897
00:51:25,914 --> 00:51:29,475
And a hot dog. And a poodle.

898
00:51:29,551 --> 00:51:32,042
[boy 1] l run. Twenty-four dive, l run.

899
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:33,951
- Ready? Break!
- Break!

900
00:51:34,022 --> 00:51:36,684
- [boy 2] All right!
- Where...? l go...?

901
00:51:36,758 --> 00:51:37,816
What the...?

902
00:51:37,892 --> 00:51:40,884
[coach] Douglas! Tailback!

903
00:51:40,962 --> 00:51:42,862
Tail...! Behind the fullback!

904
00:51:42,931 --> 00:51:44,523
Back up! Back up! Back up!

905
00:51:44,599 --> 00:51:47,329
Back! Back, back, back,
back, back! Right there!

906
00:51:47,402 --> 00:51:49,700
- Stay right there!
- [quarterback calls play]

907
00:51:49,771 --> 00:51:52,740
Set! Hut!

908
00:51:52,807 --> 00:51:56,106
- [boys] Block him!
- Here it comes!

909
00:51:57,378 --> 00:51:59,141
[coach] You got the ball! Run! Run!

910
00:51:59,214 --> 00:52:00,875
Whoa!

911
00:52:00,949 --> 00:52:04,043
- [grunts]
- [crowd groans]

912
00:52:04,118 --> 00:52:06,211
- Ooh!
- Ow!

913
00:52:06,287 --> 00:52:09,723
- [blowing whistle]
- [Dave] Man! That's gotta hurt.

914
00:52:09,791 --> 00:52:11,884
- [sighs]
- [coach] Hustle!

915
00:52:13,828 --> 00:52:16,422
[Dave] Attaboy, Josh.
Come on! Shake it off.

916
00:52:16,497 --> 00:52:18,897
Pain is just fear
leavin' your body, buddy.

917
00:52:18,967 --> 00:52:20,901
You completely suck, Douglas.

918
00:52:20,969 --> 00:52:24,063
Why do you even show up?
Everybody thinks you're a loser.

919
00:52:24,138 --> 00:52:26,368
[barks, growls]

920
00:52:29,777 --> 00:52:32,177
Thanks, pal.

921
00:52:32,247 --> 00:52:34,078
Wish l could buy you an ice cream.

922
00:52:34,148 --> 00:52:37,311
But l've got paws
and, uh, don't have a wallet,

923
00:52:37,385 --> 00:52:40,047
because l'm actually nude right now.

924
00:52:42,523 --> 00:52:45,185
[Tracy] Football?
That's why you're not trying out?

925
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:47,057
[chuckles] You hate football!

926
00:52:47,128 --> 00:52:49,961
[Josh] Shh! l know, but my dad loves it.

927
00:52:50,031 --> 00:52:53,967
You should hear him. ''Ah, you're
gonna be just like your old man.''

928
00:52:54,035 --> 00:52:56,629
lf l told him l wanted
to do a musical instead,

929
00:52:56,704 --> 00:52:58,865
he'd, like, write me off as a son.

930
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:00,407
[Dave] Aw, Josh.

931
00:53:00,475 --> 00:53:02,875
Josh, is your father a stupid man?

932
00:53:02,944 --> 00:53:04,878
No. But he is clueless,

933
00:53:04,946 --> 00:53:08,404
- which, in some ways, is better.
- [Dave] Oh, boy.

934
00:53:08,483 --> 00:53:11,145
See, he told me l could only
play if l keep my grades up.

935
00:53:11,219 --> 00:53:14,416
So l started flunking math.
But he only let me off with a warning.

936
00:53:14,489 --> 00:53:16,753
So now l gotta flunk English

937
00:53:16,824 --> 00:53:19,088
and maybe history and home ec,

938
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:21,628
which is actually really hard to fail.

939
00:53:21,696 --> 00:53:23,288
[Dave] Aww, no, Josh.

940
00:53:23,364 --> 00:53:27,232
So you'd rather wreck your future
than tell your dad you hate football?

941
00:53:27,302 --> 00:53:30,999
l can get my grades back up,
as long as he makes me quit in time.

942
00:53:32,373 --> 00:53:33,840
[scoffs] Wow.

943
00:53:33,908 --> 00:53:36,240
Men are so complicated.

944
00:53:38,046 --> 00:53:40,310
- Come on.
- [Dave] How did l let this happen?

945
00:53:40,381 --> 00:53:42,372
[stammers] What kind of a father am l?

946
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:47,713
[Carly] So? What do you think
of the new pamphlet?

947
00:53:47,789 --> 00:53:49,347
[Trey] lt's infuriating.

948
00:53:49,424 --> 00:53:51,688
No, but in a good way.

949
00:53:51,759 --> 00:53:55,024
Makes me wanna get out there
and do something about animal testing.

950
00:53:55,096 --> 00:53:56,791
The response l was hoping for.

951
00:53:56,864 --> 00:54:00,095
Hey, hey, hey, hey, what're you
doin' in my daughter's bedroom?

952
00:54:00,168 --> 00:54:02,102
- You rock.
- [chuckles]

953
00:54:02,170 --> 00:54:04,001
Don't even think about it, Trey.

954
00:54:04,072 --> 00:54:05,164
Shaggy, stop.

955
00:54:06,741 --> 00:54:08,606
What's that?

956
00:54:08,676 --> 00:54:10,007
That's really well-done.

957
00:54:10,078 --> 00:54:12,342
Admit it, this
is more effective than a tattoo.

958
00:54:12,413 --> 00:54:14,278
One thing l learned from Mr. Forrester

959
00:54:14,349 --> 00:54:16,749
is that just because
something seems ridiculous

960
00:54:16,818 --> 00:54:18,308
doesn't mean that it's wrong.

961
00:54:18,386 --> 00:54:21,150
lt just takes more courage
to stand up for it.

962
00:54:21,222 --> 00:54:23,622
[Dave] Wow,
you really believe all of this.

963
00:54:23,691 --> 00:54:25,682
l am so proud of you.

964
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,694
[giggles] Shaggy, stop.

965
00:54:27,762 --> 00:54:29,093
All right. Down, boy.

966
00:54:29,163 --> 00:54:31,529
[Dave] Hey, easy on the hands, bud.

967
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:33,829
l mean, just imagine
what would have happened

968
00:54:33,901 --> 00:54:36,802
if we hadn't stolen Shaggy
from Grant & Strictland.

969
00:54:36,871 --> 00:54:39,237
[Dave] You what? Stolen?!

970
00:54:39,307 --> 00:54:42,765
You stole a dog from Grant & Strictland,
and you lied about it.

971
00:54:42,844 --> 00:54:45,745
Shaggy. Shaggy, c'mon. C'mon.
Go fetch, boy. C'mon, boy.

972
00:54:45,813 --> 00:54:49,374
l am not your boy, and l'm not
gonna go... Hey, l'll be right back.

973
00:54:52,553 --> 00:54:55,317
[groans] l've got to stop doing that.

974
00:54:55,390 --> 00:54:59,224
<i>[Josh] ° I've got chills
They're multiplyin'</i>

975
00:54:59,293 --> 00:55:03,559
<i>° And I'm losin' control °</i>

976
00:55:05,133 --> 00:55:06,361
[Dave] Keep goin'.

977
00:55:06,434 --> 00:55:09,528
What? Why're you
lookin' at me like that?

978
00:55:09,604 --> 00:55:12,505
[Dave] Hey,
you're pretty darned good at this.

979
00:55:12,573 --> 00:55:14,165
Hey, let's order some pizza.

980
00:55:14,242 --> 00:55:16,039
Mom and Dad are out to dinner.

981
00:55:16,110 --> 00:55:18,044
[Dave] Dinner. Oh, no.

982
00:55:18,112 --> 00:55:20,910
l forgot about our anniversary!

983
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:27,547
[woman clears throat]

984
00:55:27,622 --> 00:55:31,752
You should have brought a book.
The single woman's best friend.

985
00:55:31,826 --> 00:55:35,387
Oh. [laughs] l'm not single.

986
00:55:35,463 --> 00:55:37,795
Oh.

987
00:55:39,767 --> 00:55:42,031
Yet. [sighs]

988
00:55:42,103 --> 00:55:44,196
<i>[° Percy Sledge:
When A Man Loves A Woman]</i>

989
00:55:44,272 --> 00:55:47,764
l'm late, l'm late, l'm so late.
l am so late.

990
00:55:50,344 --> 00:55:52,938
l'm also a dog.

991
00:55:53,014 --> 00:55:55,608
So l can't go in there.

992
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:01,415
- [sighs]
- [Dave] You are so beautiful.

993
00:56:04,258 --> 00:56:05,725
Shaggy?

994
00:56:05,793 --> 00:56:08,387
[Dave] And l am so sorry, honey.

995
00:56:08,463 --> 00:56:10,590
[thunder rumbles]

996
00:56:11,732 --> 00:56:13,529
Happy anniversary.

997
00:56:17,071 --> 00:56:18,732
lt's me.

998
00:56:18,806 --> 00:56:22,435
l cannot believe that you stood me up
for our anniversary dinner.

999
00:56:22,510 --> 00:56:25,570
[sobbing] And then you send
the dog with roses in his mouth?

1000
00:56:25,646 --> 00:56:28,240
Are you trying to push me away?

1001
00:56:29,417 --> 00:56:31,885
[sighs] We need to talk, but...

1002
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:35,188
l don't know how we're
gonna get past this one.

1003
00:56:35,256 --> 00:56:37,190
[Dave] What?

1004
00:56:37,258 --> 00:56:38,418
Goodbye.

1005
00:56:39,427 --> 00:56:42,692
Honey, no. Please don't cry.

1006
00:56:42,763 --> 00:56:45,527
lt didn't used to be like this, Shaggy.

1007
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:48,535
He used to be here for everything.

1008
00:56:48,603 --> 00:56:51,538
And if he couldn't be,
then he would call,

1009
00:56:51,606 --> 00:56:54,074
or he would send a note
or flowers, or he'd...

1010
00:56:54,141 --> 00:56:55,904
Sometimes he would write these...

1011
00:56:55,977 --> 00:56:58,969
These funny little rhymes. [sniffs]

1012
00:56:59,046 --> 00:57:01,173
[Dave whimpering]

1013
00:57:01,249 --> 00:57:02,876
[Rebecca crying] Oh, Shaggy.

1014
00:57:02,950 --> 00:57:05,384
Don't you cry too.

1015
00:57:05,453 --> 00:57:09,116
Aww. ls this how it ends? [sniffs]

1016
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:12,682
With him God-knows-where
and me hugging the dog?

1017
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:16,696
[Dave] l'm gonna figure out what
happened to me, and l'm gonna fix it.

1018
00:57:16,764 --> 00:57:19,699
And l'm gonna
be a better man. l promise.

1019
00:57:19,767 --> 00:57:21,667
- [crying] Oh.
- l love you.

1020
00:57:21,736 --> 00:57:23,863
[growling] l love you.

1021
00:57:23,938 --> 00:57:26,873
Don't pee in the car, OK?
We're almost home.

1022
00:57:26,941 --> 00:57:28,704
[whimpering]

1023
00:57:33,714 --> 00:57:36,706
Hey, thanks, honey.

1024
00:57:42,623 --> 00:57:43,715
Oh, boy.

1025
00:57:49,330 --> 00:57:52,766
- This is just not workin'.
- [thunder rumbling]

1026
00:57:52,833 --> 00:57:55,427
l'm not a bad dog.

1027
00:57:55,503 --> 00:57:58,097
But l'm a terrible man.

1028
00:57:58,172 --> 00:58:01,505
l've got to make this better.

1029
00:58:03,177 --> 00:58:06,169
- [heartbeat accelerates]
- [dog barks echoing]

1030
00:58:18,593 --> 00:58:20,584
[thunder rumbles]

1031
00:58:42,416 --> 00:58:43,644
[door opens]

1032
00:58:43,718 --> 00:58:45,185
Hey, Ken, thanks for s...

1033
00:58:45,252 --> 00:58:47,345
Hey, hey, Dave.
lt's three in the morning,

1034
00:58:47,421 --> 00:58:49,912
and you want a warrant
to search Grant & Strictland.

1035
00:58:49,991 --> 00:58:51,515
- Right.
- They're the victims.

1036
00:58:51,592 --> 00:58:53,685
Listen, listen.
You gotta trust me on this.

1037
00:58:53,761 --> 00:58:57,060
Kozak is hidin' somethin'.
Forrester was framed for that arson.

1038
00:58:57,131 --> 00:58:59,725
lf Forrester was framed,
why'd he throw in the towel?

1039
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:02,428
What...? What're you talking about?

1040
00:59:02,503 --> 00:59:04,835
Forrester pleaded out.

1041
00:59:06,407 --> 00:59:08,341
Well, why didn't somebody tell me that?

1042
00:59:08,409 --> 00:59:11,344
- 'Cause you're off the case.
- You can't do this.

1043
00:59:11,412 --> 00:59:14,904
The jury convenes at ten to hear
Forrester's plea. l'll handle it.

1044
00:59:14,982 --> 00:59:18,042
And l want you to either
get your head screwed on straight

1045
00:59:18,119 --> 00:59:20,178
or find another job. ls that clear?

1046
00:59:20,254 --> 00:59:23,246
Abundantly clear.
However, the point l had to...

1047
00:59:44,812 --> 00:59:46,871
[sniffing]

1048
00:59:54,021 --> 00:59:56,285
[sniffing]

1049
00:59:56,357 --> 00:59:58,018
[whimpers]

1050
01:00:04,899 --> 01:00:06,890
[barking]

1051
01:00:08,502 --> 01:00:10,970
[screeching]

1052
01:00:11,038 --> 01:00:14,166
[all barking]

1053
01:00:16,977 --> 01:00:19,810
- What's gotten into them?
- l don't know.

1054
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:22,212
Eh, boy.

1055
01:00:25,186 --> 01:00:27,313
Can't...

1056
01:00:27,388 --> 01:00:29,322
That's not gonna work.

1057
01:00:29,390 --> 01:00:31,255
l'm too big.

1058
01:00:45,406 --> 01:00:47,840
Hey, you. Hold on a second.
Do me a favor.

1059
01:00:47,908 --> 01:00:50,274
All right? Here.

1060
01:00:50,344 --> 01:00:53,006
All right. Throw the stick, over there.

1061
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:54,672
Why would l throw the stick?

1062
01:00:54,749 --> 01:00:56,341
Just throw the stick, please.

1063
01:00:56,417 --> 01:00:58,180
Why would l throw the stick?

1064
01:00:58,252 --> 01:01:01,585
Because l'll give you
$5 to throw the stick.

1065
01:01:01,655 --> 01:01:04,818
Oh, l look like a guy
who needs 5 bucks.

1066
01:01:07,094 --> 01:01:08,686
Gimme the money.

1067
01:01:08,763 --> 01:01:11,095
- Speed or distance?
- Uh, distance.

1068
01:01:25,579 --> 01:01:28,514
[panting] lt's so close. lt's close.

1069
01:01:28,582 --> 01:01:30,015
This time, throw it

1070
01:01:30,084 --> 01:01:31,847
and... and yell, ''Fetch!''

1071
01:01:33,554 --> 01:01:35,317
Don't make me bite ya.

1072
01:01:37,024 --> 01:01:38,355
Fetch!

1073
01:01:43,063 --> 01:01:46,396
Wow. l can't believe that worked.
Thanks!

1074
01:01:47,401 --> 01:01:48,732
Whoa.

1075
01:01:52,206 --> 01:01:54,140
[grunts] Drop the stick.

1076
01:01:54,208 --> 01:01:57,644
All right. Perfect. Nice fit.

1077
01:02:00,281 --> 01:02:02,545
[sniffs] That's it, follow your nose.

1078
01:02:04,051 --> 01:02:06,144
Wait a minute. [sniffs]
What's that smell?

1079
01:02:06,220 --> 01:02:08,347
What is it? Oh, it's me.

1080
01:02:22,369 --> 01:02:24,303
[sighs]

1081
01:02:24,371 --> 01:02:25,963
The transistor.

1082
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:29,601
The microchip. The artificial heart.

1083
01:02:30,945 --> 01:02:33,379
All footnotes compared to this.

1084
01:02:33,447 --> 01:02:35,608
[coughing]

1085
01:02:43,591 --> 01:02:44,615
[coughing]

1086
01:02:44,692 --> 01:02:46,887
[Dave] Bingo.

1087
01:02:46,961 --> 01:02:49,486
[coughs, wheezes]

1088
01:03:02,610 --> 01:03:04,908
- What's happening?
- He's going into shock.

1089
01:03:04,979 --> 01:03:06,776
lt's the serum. lt doesn't work.

1090
01:03:06,847 --> 01:03:08,781
- What do we do?
- Of course it works.

1091
01:03:08,849 --> 01:03:11,477
l just didn't give it to him.

1092
01:03:11,552 --> 01:03:14,214
- What have you done to him?
- [Kozak] Lance? Lance?

1093
01:03:14,288 --> 01:03:17,280
l'm so sorry that
l had to do this to you,

1094
01:03:17,358 --> 01:03:21,294
but l just couldn't let you
take all the credit again.

1095
01:03:21,362 --> 01:03:24,263
And plus, you're a pig, and l hate you.

1096
01:03:24,331 --> 01:03:27,630
l hate you in so many ways.

1097
01:03:29,637 --> 01:03:31,229
Can you hold this for a second?

1098
01:03:31,305 --> 01:03:32,897
Get rid of it, accomplice.

1099
01:03:32,973 --> 01:03:34,406
[gasps] Ah.

1100
01:03:34,475 --> 01:03:37,308
But is he... dead?

1101
01:03:37,378 --> 01:03:40,643
No, he's not dead. He's fully conscious,
but he's unable to speak.

1102
01:03:40,714 --> 01:03:43,410
Doctors will think it's dementia.

1103
01:03:43,484 --> 01:03:46,248
[Kozak] The drug itself
will wear off in a few months.

1104
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:49,517
But by then l'll be CEO,

1105
01:03:49,590 --> 01:03:52,320
and l will be fabulously,

1106
01:03:52,393 --> 01:03:55,521
insanely, unimaginably wealthy.

1107
01:03:55,596 --> 01:03:58,690
- This was not part of the plan.
- This is totally wrong.

1108
01:03:58,766 --> 01:04:01,064
Of course, l'll cut both
of you in on his share.

1109
01:04:02,202 --> 01:04:04,602
- l'm cool with that.
- lt's fine by me.

1110
01:04:04,672 --> 01:04:06,765
Good. Uh, Larry,

1111
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:09,775
why don't you wheel him up
to his office, park him at his desk.

1112
01:04:09,843 --> 01:04:12,607
Or, uh, should l say, my desk?

1113
01:04:13,647 --> 01:04:17,413
[Dave] Oh, boy. Gotta get outta here.
Go, go, go, go, go!

1114
01:04:19,019 --> 01:04:20,748
- What was that?
- What was that?

1115
01:04:20,821 --> 01:04:23,085
[Dave] l knew Kozak was up to something.

1116
01:04:25,192 --> 01:04:27,422
Carly was right about everything.

1117
01:04:27,494 --> 01:04:29,428
Forrester was framed.

1118
01:04:29,496 --> 01:04:31,964
[barks] Uh-oh.

1119
01:04:34,768 --> 01:04:36,895
Looks like l'm walkin'.

1120
01:04:40,641 --> 01:04:43,303
- [Gwen] Wow.
- [Larry] That's somethin'.

1121
01:04:43,377 --> 01:04:46,744
That's... Wow. Do you realize
the significance of that?

1122
01:04:46,814 --> 01:04:48,907
Wow. You think?

1123
01:04:48,983 --> 01:04:50,917
Yeah, l think it's mildly significant.

1124
01:04:50,985 --> 01:04:53,613
Unfortunately, it's on tape.

1125
01:04:53,687 --> 01:04:56,019
So we... [stammers]

1126
01:04:57,591 --> 01:05:00,059
[sighs] l'll tell you
what we're gonna do.

1127
01:05:00,127 --> 01:05:03,528
You two are going
to pay Mr. Douglas a visit.

1128
01:05:17,678 --> 01:05:19,202
[sighs]

1129
01:05:29,623 --> 01:05:32,023
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1130
01:05:32,092 --> 01:05:36,028
No, not my babies. Not my darlings.

1131
01:05:36,096 --> 01:05:37,688
Oh, evil.

1132
01:05:37,765 --> 01:05:39,357
These hooligans! [grunts]

1133
01:05:47,708 --> 01:05:50,108
Where's Trey?
We're gonna be late for school.

1134
01:05:50,177 --> 01:05:52,168
Shoulda gotten a ride from Mom.

1135
01:05:55,249 --> 01:05:56,375
What's the matter?

1136
01:05:56,450 --> 01:05:59,385
[sobs] Do you realize what's happening?

1137
01:05:59,453 --> 01:06:02,013
Mom and Dad are splitting up.

1138
01:06:02,089 --> 01:06:03,750
How do you know?

1139
01:06:03,824 --> 01:06:06,190
[scoffs] Josh, it's obvious.

1140
01:06:06,260 --> 01:06:08,421
[doorbell rings]

1141
01:06:12,399 --> 01:06:13,593
- [barks]
- Shaggy.

1142
01:06:13,667 --> 01:06:17,660
[Dave] l witnessed an attempted murder.
You were right about everything.

1143
01:06:17,738 --> 01:06:20,935
An innocent man is about ready
to go to jail. l gotta take a nap.

1144
01:06:21,008 --> 01:06:22,532
Don't wake me unless l'm human.

1145
01:06:22,609 --> 01:06:24,543
l mean, did you see that note he left?

1146
01:06:24,611 --> 01:06:26,340
''l'll explain everything''?

1147
01:06:26,413 --> 01:06:28,347
We're gonna get the talk.

1148
01:06:28,415 --> 01:06:29,439
What talk?

1149
01:06:29,516 --> 01:06:32,212
The ''Mom and Dad
are having problems'' talk.

1150
01:06:32,286 --> 01:06:34,811
Then Dad'll leave.

1151
01:06:34,888 --> 01:06:38,722
[scoffs] They'll say it's
temporary, but it won't be.

1152
01:06:38,792 --> 01:06:41,386
Are you sure you're not
just drama-queening?

1153
01:06:41,462 --> 01:06:44,397
Josh, he didn't even
come home last night.

1154
01:06:45,399 --> 01:06:47,094
But if you ask me,

1155
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:50,295
he stopped caring
a long time before that.

1156
01:06:52,539 --> 01:06:55,702
[Dave] No, no, no, no.
No, that's not it.

1157
01:06:55,776 --> 01:06:58,438
No, no, no.

1158
01:07:13,660 --> 01:07:15,491
[Carly] Shaggy.

1159
01:07:17,998 --> 01:07:20,330
Shaggy, would you stop
making such a...?

1160
01:07:23,070 --> 01:07:25,038
That's impossible.

1161
01:07:29,409 --> 01:07:30,740
[Dave] Finally.

1162
01:07:35,616 --> 01:07:36,674
How?

1163
01:07:45,692 --> 01:07:48,490
- [Josh] Grant & Strictland?
- Yes.

1164
01:07:48,562 --> 01:07:52,020
Mr. Forrester said they were
making mutant animals,

1165
01:07:52,099 --> 01:07:55,193
and... and that's
where l found Shaggy.

1166
01:07:55,269 --> 01:07:57,897
And Shaggy bit Dad.

1167
01:07:59,206 --> 01:08:01,674
- [whimpers]
- [gasps] Oh, Daddy!

1168
01:08:01,742 --> 01:08:04,302
[Dave] lt's OK, kiddo. lt's OK.

1169
01:08:04,378 --> 01:08:07,643
[crying] l'm so sorry.
This is all my fault.

1170
01:08:08,749 --> 01:08:10,307
Can you please forgive me?

1171
01:08:10,384 --> 01:08:12,443
There's nothin' to forgive.

1172
01:08:14,188 --> 01:08:16,850
[crying]

1173
01:08:17,858 --> 01:08:19,849
l'm gonna go call Mom.

1174
01:08:21,061 --> 01:08:24,553
So you saw the game yesterday?

1175
01:08:24,631 --> 01:08:25,996
Yeah.

1176
01:08:26,066 --> 01:08:29,365
l didn't want to let you down,
but l'm just no good.

1177
01:08:29,436 --> 01:08:32,530
No, no, no, no, no, no. You are good.

1178
01:08:34,908 --> 01:08:36,569
<i>- [ringing]
- Come on, come on.</i>

1179
01:08:43,483 --> 01:08:46,714
Josh? This...

1180
01:08:46,787 --> 01:08:48,778
There we go. Lemme get in here.

1181
01:08:53,427 --> 01:08:56,692
Do this. This is what you love.

1182
01:08:56,763 --> 01:09:00,028
'Cause if you keep playin' football,
you're gonna get hurt.

1183
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:02,000
Thanks, Dad.

1184
01:09:02,069 --> 01:09:03,866
[Dave] And somethin' else.

1185
01:09:08,875 --> 01:09:10,240

1186
01:09:10,310 --> 01:09:13,245
- Deal?
- lt's a deal.

1187
01:09:13,313 --> 01:09:14,871
Mom, it's Carly.

1188
01:09:14,948 --> 01:09:17,849
Call me back as soon
as you get this message. Bye.

1189
01:09:17,918 --> 01:09:20,352
[Dave] Did you hear that?
Did you hear that?

1190
01:09:20,420 --> 01:09:22,547
Somebody's peein' on the lawn!

1191
01:09:22,623 --> 01:09:25,615
Nobody makes it on my lawn
and gets away with it!

1192
01:09:25,692 --> 01:09:28,252

1193
01:09:29,396 --> 01:09:30,727
Oh!

1194
01:09:34,534 --> 01:09:36,798
[woozy] Clean up on aisle three.

1195
01:09:36,870 --> 01:09:39,395
Price check on dog biscuits.

1196
01:09:39,473 --> 01:09:42,203
OK. Hi, Mr. Douglas.

1197
01:09:42,276 --> 01:09:43,937
- Who are you?
- How are ya?

1198
01:09:44,011 --> 01:09:46,002
[growls]

1199
01:09:48,815 --> 01:09:51,079
[mumbling] Wait a second. l don't...

1200
01:09:51,151 --> 01:09:53,051
l don't feel so good.

1201
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:55,918
- Dad!
- Dad! Daddy!

1202
01:09:55,989 --> 01:09:57,854
- Hit it.
- Yeah, OK.

1203
01:09:59,593 --> 01:10:02,357
[tires squealing]

1204
01:10:11,705 --> 01:10:14,640
l'm sorry you're a dog. l am.

1205
01:10:14,708 --> 01:10:19,338
Also, very sorry that you
won't be leaving here alive.

1206
01:10:19,413 --> 01:10:22,974
People will be wondering
where you've disappeared to.

1207
01:10:23,050 --> 01:10:24,745
Then again...

1208
01:10:24,818 --> 01:10:27,184
...dogs do wander off. [chuckles]

1209
01:10:27,254 --> 01:10:30,417
l can't believe you think you're
gonna get away with this, Kozak.

1210
01:10:30,490 --> 01:10:33,323
Nonetheless, before you die,

1211
01:10:33,393 --> 01:10:36,191
we're going to want
to run some tests on you.

1212
01:10:36,263 --> 01:10:39,357
Eenie, meenie, minie,
cut you, hurt you, ow,

1213
01:10:39,433 --> 01:10:41,367
your nose is coming off.

1214
01:10:41,435 --> 01:10:44,268
Because we just don't understand
how you turned into him.

1215
01:10:44,338 --> 01:10:47,466
- [barks]
- l'm very excited.

1216
01:10:47,541 --> 01:10:50,874
l can't wait to get inside that body
of yours and just poke around.

1217
01:10:50,944 --> 01:10:52,468
Aah!

1218
01:10:52,546 --> 01:10:54,946
Oh, you filthy little mongrel!

1219
01:10:55,015 --> 01:10:57,984
[blows, pants] That wasn't very nice.

1220
01:10:58,051 --> 01:10:59,484
[Dave] That hurt, didn't it?

1221
01:10:59,553 --> 01:11:02,078
Gonna have to work
on that attitude when l get back.

1222
01:11:03,724 --> 01:11:07,251
Meanwhile, we are gonna
run upstairs for a minute.

1223
01:11:07,327 --> 01:11:11,286
lt seems Dr. Strictland
is having a bit of a health crisis.

1224
01:11:11,365 --> 01:11:13,765
And after that, we're off to court

1225
01:11:13,834 --> 01:11:17,827
to watch Justin Forrester
back down to save his own skin.

1226
01:11:19,506 --> 01:11:21,906
Be back to cut you up
like a birthday cake later.

1227
01:11:25,112 --> 01:11:27,046
[chittering]

1228
01:11:27,114 --> 01:11:30,174
Huh. Who are you, anyway?

1229
01:11:30,250 --> 01:11:31,512
[barking]

1230
01:11:31,585 --> 01:11:33,348
[Dave] Tibet. Really.

1231
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:35,888
Well, let me ask you this: [barking]

1232
01:11:35,956 --> 01:11:37,890
Why did you bite me?

1233
01:11:37,958 --> 01:11:41,587
And turning me into a dog
would help you... how?

1234
01:11:41,661 --> 01:11:42,992
[whimpers]

1235
01:11:43,063 --> 01:11:45,531
l guess you didn't think
about that, did you?

1236
01:11:45,599 --> 01:11:48,067
[barking, chittering]

1237
01:11:49,269 --> 01:11:51,066
Well, l turn into a human
when l sleep,

1238
01:11:51,138 --> 01:11:53,163
but there's no time
for that now, is there?

1239
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:54,935
There's gotta be another way.

1240
01:11:55,008 --> 01:11:56,873
[barking]

1241
01:11:58,111 --> 01:11:59,578
Meditation?

1242
01:12:05,419 --> 01:12:07,614
- Hey, sorry l'm late.
- Get in and drive.

1243
01:12:09,356 --> 01:12:13,156
- What's wrong with you?
- Dad's been dognapped. Go, go!

1244
01:12:14,694 --> 01:12:17,754
[Dave] lnhale, exhale.

1245
01:12:17,831 --> 01:12:20,095
l got to get my heart rate down.

1246
01:12:20,167 --> 01:12:22,897
[inhales, exhales]

1247
01:12:22,969 --> 01:12:24,231
l'm on a beach.

1248
01:12:24,304 --> 01:12:27,569
[echoing] lnhale, exhale.

1249
01:12:27,641 --> 01:12:30,371
Surrounded by fire hydrants.

1250
01:12:31,445 --> 01:12:33,572
[deep breathing]

1251
01:12:33,647 --> 01:12:35,911
Food everywhere.

1252
01:12:35,982 --> 01:12:38,951
Slow rolling waves of gravy,

1253
01:12:39,019 --> 01:12:41,681
crashing onto the shore.

1254
01:12:49,329 --> 01:12:52,662
The beached whale
made of peanut butter.

1255
01:12:52,732 --> 01:12:54,723
[heartbeat slowing]

1256
01:13:07,747 --> 01:13:09,237
[Dave] lt worked.

1257
01:13:09,316 --> 01:13:11,944
lt worked. Great.

1258
01:13:12,018 --> 01:13:14,248
- [barks]
- l'm back. lt's good, it's good.

1259
01:13:14,321 --> 01:13:15,982
[howling]

1260
01:13:18,091 --> 01:13:21,652
- New problem. New problem.
- [barks]

1261
01:13:21,728 --> 01:13:24,663
[Dave] Yeah. l've got to get those keys.

1262
01:13:24,731 --> 01:13:26,631
Now if l could just get over there.

1263
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:29,692
OK. Yeah. Go. Go.

1264
01:13:29,769 --> 01:13:31,396
- Go.
- [creaking]

1265
01:13:32,405 --> 01:13:33,997
Oh, no.

1266
01:13:34,074 --> 01:13:35,701
No, no, no, no, no... Oh!

1267
01:13:35,775 --> 01:13:38,266
Oh! Oh.

1268
01:13:38,345 --> 01:13:40,575
[grunting] Oh.

1269
01:13:40,647 --> 01:13:42,444
Oh, boy. OK.

1270
01:13:42,516 --> 01:13:43,915
Who's got a plan?

1271
01:13:46,419 --> 01:13:48,284
Snake! Do they have ears?

1272
01:13:48,355 --> 01:13:50,482
- [barking]
- Can you hear me?

1273
01:13:50,557 --> 01:13:52,855
- [barks]
- Don't need to show that hood at me.

1274
01:13:52,926 --> 01:13:55,554
You better watch
'cause it's gonna fall over.

1275
01:13:55,629 --> 01:13:57,995
- All right, monkey.
- [hooting]

1276
01:13:58,064 --> 01:13:59,964
Sorry, chimp. You gotta push.

1277
01:14:00,033 --> 01:14:01,091
On three, ready?

1278
01:14:01,167 --> 01:14:04,864
One, two, three. Push!

1279
01:14:04,938 --> 01:14:08,931
Harder this time. One, two, three. Push!

1280
01:14:09,876 --> 01:14:13,334
[Dave] l need some help from
the rabbits. You gotta hop into this.

1281
01:14:13,413 --> 01:14:16,143
One, two, three. Hop!

1282
01:14:16,216 --> 01:14:18,446
Aw, ya almost got it. Ya almost got it.

1283
01:14:18,518 --> 01:14:20,884
One more time.
We got a big one. Here we go.

1284
01:14:20,954 --> 01:14:24,082
One, two, three. Hop!

1285

[Dave] Yo, snake! Walk, skirt...

1288
01:14:38,972 --> 01:14:41,099
Do what... Uh, you know, slither.

1289
01:14:42,976 --> 01:14:45,672
Go, go, go. Come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

1290
01:14:45,745 --> 01:14:49,146
Yeah, yeah. Thattaboy, Thattaboy!

1291
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:50,682
Do you see where it is?

1292
01:14:50,750 --> 01:14:52,342
'Course you do. Perfect.

1293
01:14:52,419 --> 01:14:55,149
Stretch. Reach up.

1294
01:14:55,221 --> 01:14:57,155
Up there, up there.

1295
01:14:57,223 --> 01:14:59,248
That's it, that's it, that's it.

1296
01:15:00,794 --> 01:15:02,386
[Dave chuckles]

1297
01:15:04,998 --> 01:15:06,488
Beautiful.

1298
01:15:08,668 --> 01:15:10,727
Yes! We're outta here!

1299
01:15:10,804 --> 01:15:14,137
[all barking]

1300
01:15:18,712 --> 01:15:21,272
[grunts] Up, up.

1301

Yes! You're next.

1303

Follow the dog.

All right. Come on. Come on. Come on.

1305
01:15:33,126 --> 01:15:34,115
Up there. Go!

1306
01:15:34,194 --> 01:15:35,661
Take care of the rabbit.

1307
01:15:35,729 --> 01:15:37,196
- [gas hissing]
- [belches]

1308
01:15:37,263 --> 01:15:39,163
[Dave] Get it? Help him out.

1309
01:15:39,232 --> 01:15:41,462
Easy, easy. Come here.

[grunting] Jeez.

1314
01:15:55,982 --> 01:15:57,574
What have you been eatin'?

1315
01:16:00,587 --> 01:16:02,452
- [barks]
- [Dave] Sorry about that.

1316
01:16:02,522 --> 01:16:04,922
All right, up here. Up here. Up...

1317
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:08,586
Boy, you're heavy for a snake.

1318
01:16:08,662 --> 01:16:12,359
Come on. Oh! Oh! Uh!

1319
01:16:15,068 --> 01:16:18,868
Ooh, yeah. That's creepy. That's...

That's creepy. Whoo. All right.

1321
01:16:22,375 --> 01:16:25,538
[Dave] lt's a left, a left,
a right and a left.

1322
01:16:25,612 --> 01:16:26,977
Just go towards the light.

1323
01:16:27,047 --> 01:16:29,208
l'll meet you guys out there.

1324
01:16:29,282 --> 01:16:32,251
[electricity crackling]

1325
01:16:35,155 --> 01:16:36,952
- Nice.
- Thank you.

1326
01:16:37,023 --> 01:16:39,116
[barking]

1327
01:16:39,192 --> 01:16:40,955
[howls]

1328
01:16:49,436 --> 01:16:51,631
There he is! Look!

1329
01:16:51,705 --> 01:16:53,969
Come here! Come on, Dad! Come on!

1330
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:56,031
Come on, let's go!

1331
01:16:57,110 --> 01:16:59,476
We won't let them get away with it.
Don't worry.

1332
01:16:59,546 --> 01:17:01,013
- [barking]
- That's right.

1333
01:17:08,188 --> 01:17:11,646
You know, you guys seem like
nice young people with great futures.

1334
01:17:11,725 --> 01:17:14,922
You know that l'm
the deputy district attorney.

1335
01:17:14,994 --> 01:17:16,859
Kidnapping is a capital crime.

1336
01:17:16,930 --> 01:17:19,023
You just can't lock people
in cages, guys.

1337
01:17:19,099 --> 01:17:22,933
Yeah, there's a definite... line
we're crossing here.

1338
01:17:23,002 --> 01:17:25,197
We crossed that line
a long time ago, Larry.

1339
01:17:25,271 --> 01:17:26,738
[Gwen] Deal with it.

1340
01:17:34,481 --> 01:17:36,711
You know, you're not
gonna get away with this.

1341
01:17:36,783 --> 01:17:38,751
Now...

1342
01:17:38,818 --> 01:17:43,016
...you be a good little doggy
and do just what we say.

1343
01:17:43,089 --> 01:17:45,421
[electricity crackling]

1344
01:17:49,362 --> 01:17:52,422
Doesn't feel so good to get zapped,
does it? Attaboy, chimp!

1345
01:17:52,499 --> 01:17:54,763
Good, now get over here
and get me out of here.

1346
01:17:54,834 --> 01:17:56,597
Come on. Put that thing down.

1347
01:17:58,638 --> 01:18:00,629
- [barking]
- Please don't be mad, Daddy.

1348
01:18:00,707 --> 01:18:04,643
Don't worry, Dad. We're gonna take you
to Mom and explain everything.

1349
01:18:05,645 --> 01:18:08,580
[sighs] He's really angry.

1350
01:18:08,648 --> 01:18:11,378
- [animals chittering]
- All right. We gotta go.

1351
01:18:11,451 --> 01:18:14,477
Do you know which way the door is?

1352
01:18:14,554 --> 01:18:17,148
All right. Good, good, good.
Which way?

1353
01:18:18,525 --> 01:18:20,584
- Are you sure?
- [monkey chitters]

1354
01:18:23,296 --> 01:18:25,958
l like the dark travertine better.
What do you think?

1355
01:18:26,032 --> 01:18:27,624
l agree. l'll push for that one.

1356
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:28,894
- Yeah.
- OK, good.

1357
01:18:28,968 --> 01:18:30,629
[barking]

1358
01:18:32,038 --> 01:18:35,303
Could you just excuse me
for a minute? l...

1359
01:18:35,375 --> 01:18:37,639
Oh, yeah, sure.

1360
01:18:37,710 --> 01:18:39,701
lt's tough bein' a single mom.

1361
01:18:39,779 --> 01:18:42,475
[sighs] l'm not a single mom.

1362
01:18:42,549 --> 01:18:44,141
[Carly] Mom, we need to talk.

1363
01:18:44,217 --> 01:18:46,947
Why aren't you guys in school?
And why is Shaggy here?

1364
01:18:47,020 --> 01:18:48,851
lt's not a dog. lt's Dad.

1365
01:18:50,390 --> 01:18:53,291
l thought we were going
to break it to her slowly.

1366
01:18:53,359 --> 01:18:56,294
Grant & Strictland's been doing
these weird animal tests.

1367
01:18:56,362 --> 01:18:59,297
So when Shaggy bit Dad,
he turned into a dog.

1368
01:18:59,365 --> 01:19:01,890
- Carly, that's not possible.
- lt's true.

1369
01:19:01,968 --> 01:19:03,526
lt... The computer.

1370
01:19:03,603 --> 01:19:06,003
The other night,
he was typing on the computer.

1371
01:19:06,072 --> 01:19:08,165
Come on, Dad. Type Mom a message.

1372
01:19:08,241 --> 01:19:09,503
Come on.

1373
01:19:09,576 --> 01:19:11,168
- [growling]
- Come on.

1374
01:19:11,244 --> 01:19:13,644
Come on, Dad.
Do it like you did the other night.

1375
01:19:13,713 --> 01:19:15,146
Come on. You know, like this.

1376
01:19:16,316 --> 01:19:19,581
Just one sentence. ''l am Dad.''

1377
01:19:19,652 --> 01:19:22,553
- How 'bout just ''Dad''?
- [Rebecca sighs]

1378
01:19:24,157 --> 01:19:25,146
Kids...

1379
01:19:25,225 --> 01:19:27,250
...l know that these last couple days

1380
01:19:27,327 --> 01:19:29,761
<i>- have been difficult, but...
- [phone rings]</i>

1381
01:19:31,297 --> 01:19:34,198
<i>[phone ringing]</i>

1382
01:19:35,301 --> 01:19:37,030
<i>- Hello?
- Hi, honey, it's me.</i>

1383
01:19:37,103 --> 01:19:38,536
lt's your father.

1384
01:19:39,439 --> 01:19:42,806
Wow. Uh, so many questions.

1385
01:19:42,876 --> 01:19:45,743
<i>Do you know why the kids
are at my office with Shaggy?</i>

1386
01:19:45,812 --> 01:19:49,805
He's not Shaggy.
His name is Khyi Yag Po.

1387
01:19:49,883 --> 01:19:51,646
- Khyi Yag who?
- [barks]

1388
01:19:51,718 --> 01:19:53,345
<i>[Dave] Po, that's his real name.</i>

1389
01:19:53,419 --> 01:19:56,013
You know, how did the kids
find him? That's weird.

1390
01:19:56,089 --> 01:19:58,182
That is not the only thing that's weird.

1391
01:19:58,258 --> 01:20:00,852
No, not that.
You oughta see what l'm lookin' at.

1392
01:20:00,927 --> 01:20:03,418
They're trying
to tell me that he is you.

1393
01:20:03,496 --> 01:20:05,396
[Dave] Stop that! What are you doing?

1394
01:20:05,465 --> 01:20:07,626
Stop doing that, all right?
You, quiet down.

1395
01:20:07,700 --> 01:20:11,227
He's not... Guys, guys,
guys, guys! He's not me.

1396
01:20:11,304 --> 01:20:13,204
Well, yes, l gathered that.

1397
01:20:13,273 --> 01:20:16,538
But they're half right. Look, um,
l'll meet you at the courthouse,

1398
01:20:16,609 --> 01:20:18,338
and l'll explain everything to ya.

1399
01:20:18,411 --> 01:20:21,574
<i>- [Rebecca] You better explain it now.
- Well, l can't explain...</i>

1400
01:20:21,648 --> 01:20:25,277
Hold on a sec. l can't. The chimp.
What? Excuse me. The monkey...

1401
01:20:25,351 --> 01:20:26,909
<i>- [Rebecca] Hello?
- What is it?</i>

1402
01:20:26,986 --> 01:20:28,715
[squealing]

1403
01:20:28,788 --> 01:20:32,053
The chimp... The chimp?
The chimp has got sunglasses on.

1404
01:20:32,125 --> 01:20:34,150
He's supposed to be
giving me directions.

1405
01:20:36,696 --> 01:20:40,029
- [snarls]
- Honey, you gotta believe me.

1406
01:20:40,099 --> 01:20:42,624
- [barking]
- [panting]

1407
01:20:47,073 --> 01:20:49,064
[barking]

1408
01:20:52,045 --> 01:20:54,639
- l'll meet you at the courthouse.
- What?

1409
01:20:54,714 --> 01:20:57,877
Just meet me at the courthouse
and bring me some clothes, OK?

1410
01:20:57,951 --> 01:20:59,441
- Dave!
- Watch the rat!

1411
01:20:59,519 --> 01:21:02,886
l love you! Everybody, calm down!

1412
01:21:02,956 --> 01:21:04,287
Dave!

1413
01:21:05,658 --> 01:21:07,023
What's the matter with you?

1414
01:21:07,093 --> 01:21:09,254
How come you can't act
like the snake, right?

1415
01:21:09,329 --> 01:21:11,263
- [barks]
- Eh.

1416
01:21:11,331 --> 01:21:14,323
He wants us to meet him
at the courthouse with clothes.

1417
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:18,302
- l don't get it.
- lt doesn't make any sense.

1418
01:21:18,371 --> 01:21:20,032
Two days ago,

1419
01:21:20,106 --> 01:21:23,303
when your father came home
in the middle of the night,

1420
01:21:23,376 --> 01:21:26,038
he tried to convince me that...

1421
01:21:26,112 --> 01:21:28,171
...he'd turned into a dog.

1422
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:36,445
- Let's go to the courthouse.
- Come on, come on.

1423
01:21:36,522 --> 01:21:37,921
That's my Norah Jones CD.

1424
01:21:37,991 --> 01:21:40,653
[Dave] You can play it
if you want. Play it.

1425
01:21:40,727 --> 01:21:43,321
- [horn honking]
- Or you could throw it out of the car.

1426
01:21:43,396 --> 01:21:48,356
Why'd you do that? Oh, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1427
01:21:48,434 --> 01:21:50,299
Everybody watch out, watch out!

1428
01:21:50,370 --> 01:21:53,533
[tires squealing]

1429
01:21:53,606 --> 01:21:56,370
- [Dave] Ahh!
- [snarls]

1430
01:21:57,377 --> 01:22:00,175
Phew. We're all done?

1431
01:22:00,246 --> 01:22:02,339
lt's OK. Yeah, it's all right.

1432
01:22:02,415 --> 01:22:04,849
l know, l saw it coming. [sighs]

1433
01:22:04,917 --> 01:22:07,579
All rise for the
Honorable Judge Whittaker.

1434
01:22:10,556 --> 01:22:12,023
[bangs gavel]

1435
01:22:12,091 --> 01:22:14,082
[bailiff] Be seated and come to order.

1436
01:22:22,969 --> 01:22:24,493
All right. l gotta go, guys.

1437
01:22:24,570 --> 01:22:27,130
All right, you guys stay here.
All of you stay here.

1438
01:22:27,206 --> 01:22:30,198
Look, look. l'll be right back.
Don't talk to anybody.

1439
01:22:30,276 --> 01:22:32,574
Don't play the music, and, uh...

1440
01:22:32,645 --> 01:22:34,806
You're in charge.

1441
01:22:46,559 --> 01:22:48,891
[heartbeat accelerates]

1442
01:23:21,694 --> 01:23:25,494
[Dave] To infinity and beyond!

1443
01:23:41,114 --> 01:23:42,979
Do you guys think he's really coming?

1444
01:23:43,049 --> 01:23:44,710
l don't know, kids.

1445
01:23:49,989 --> 01:23:51,616
Wait, look!

1446
01:24:01,467 --> 01:24:03,662
[barking]

1447
01:24:05,338 --> 01:24:06,737
[Carly] Daddy? ls that you?

1448
01:24:06,806 --> 01:24:08,068
[Dave] lt's me, kiddo.

1449
01:24:08,141 --> 01:24:10,735
But it can't be.

1450
01:24:10,810 --> 01:24:12,744
He's a dog.

1451
01:24:12,812 --> 01:24:15,110
[Dave] Would a dog say this:

1452
01:24:15,181 --> 01:24:18,981
[barking] l love you.

1453
01:24:19,051 --> 01:24:20,951
What did you say?

1454
01:24:21,020 --> 01:24:23,750
[barking] l love you.

1455
01:24:26,492 --> 01:24:28,756
- Oh, honey.
- [Dave] You got it.

1456
01:24:28,828 --> 01:24:30,819
l love you too.

1457
01:24:33,032 --> 01:24:37,025
[Dave] l love you.

1458
01:24:43,910 --> 01:24:46,879
lt's weird for me too. But it is me.

1459
01:24:48,481 --> 01:24:50,176
That was cool.

1460
01:24:50,249 --> 01:24:53,013
And l'm real sorry about everything.
l'm really sorry.

1461
01:24:53,085 --> 01:24:54,746
And l'll make it up to all of you.

1462
01:24:54,820 --> 01:24:56,788
But right now, l've got a trial to stop.

1463
01:24:56,856 --> 01:24:59,120
[Trey] Uh, Mr. Douglas?

1464
01:24:59,192 --> 01:25:01,353
Yeah.

1465
01:25:03,196 --> 01:25:05,528
- Ooh.
- No, l can't go.

1466
01:25:06,632 --> 01:25:07,621
[chuckles]

1467
01:25:07,700 --> 01:25:09,793
Everyone's gonna
need therapy after this.

1468
01:25:09,869 --> 01:25:11,029
Good luck, honey.

1469
01:25:11,103 --> 01:25:12,695
Counselors, you may proceed.

1470
01:25:12,772 --> 01:25:16,572
Your Honor, at this time,
my client would like to change his plea.

1471
01:25:16,642 --> 01:25:18,940
Hold everything, please.
Hold everything.

1472
01:25:19,011 --> 01:25:20,774
[crowd murmuring]

1473
01:25:20,846 --> 01:25:22,040
Kozak, sit.

1474
01:25:22,114 --> 01:25:24,912
[Judge Whittaker] Mr. Douglas,
it is my understanding

1475
01:25:24,984 --> 01:25:26,815
that you are no longer on this case.

1476
01:25:26,886 --> 01:25:29,855
- That is exactly right.
- l understand, Your Honor.

1477
01:25:29,922 --> 01:25:33,358
lf l could just have a few
moments with my associate.

1478
01:25:33,426 --> 01:25:34,950
lt's very important.

1479
01:25:37,730 --> 01:25:39,891
Thank you, Your Honor.

1480
01:25:39,966 --> 01:25:43,424
Give me a chance. Give me one more
chance. l will not disappoint you.

1481
01:25:43,502 --> 01:25:45,970
Stay, Kozak!

1482
01:25:46,038 --> 01:25:47,437
You gotta trust me.

1483
01:25:47,506 --> 01:25:50,498
lf you ever trusted me,
you gotta trust me right this minute.

1484
01:25:54,447 --> 01:25:57,211
- He's back on, Your Honor.
- [sighs]

1485
01:25:57,283 --> 01:25:58,910
We...

1486
01:25:58,985 --> 01:26:02,182
Let's get Kozak back on the stand
one more time. Let me handle it.

1487
01:26:02,255 --> 01:26:03,449
[clears throat]

1488
01:26:03,522 --> 01:26:06,923
We'd like to recall
Dr. Kozak to the stand.

1489
01:26:06,993 --> 01:26:10,793
[Judge Whittaker] Dr. Kozak,
would you please return to the stand.

1490
01:26:10,863 --> 01:26:14,321
Uh, l'd be, uh, delighted.

1491
01:26:18,004 --> 01:26:20,939
Counselor, you are
on a very short leash.

1492
01:26:21,007 --> 01:26:24,534
This court has lost all patience
with ridiculous behavior.

1493
01:26:24,610 --> 01:26:28,637
Your Honor, just because something looks
ridiculous doesn't mean it's not true.

1494
01:26:28,714 --> 01:26:31,774
Just takes more courage
to believe in it.

1495
01:26:31,851 --> 01:26:35,844
Just don't let your courage get itself
kicked out of my courtroom.

1496
01:26:37,556 --> 01:26:39,023
Thank you, Your Honor.

1497
01:26:39,091 --> 01:26:42,288
Dr. Kozak, may l remind you
you are still under oath.

1498
01:26:42,361 --> 01:26:44,022
Yes, you may.

1499
01:26:44,096 --> 01:26:47,156
Dr. Kozak, is it true your
company is workin' on a drug

1500
01:26:47,233 --> 01:26:49,701
that will extend human life
like a hundred years?

1501
01:26:49,769 --> 01:26:52,169
l am not at liberty
to discuss that matter.

1502
01:26:52,238 --> 01:26:55,173
Of course you're not.
But if that were true,

1503
01:26:55,241 --> 01:26:57,607
that would be a pretty big deal, right?

1504
01:26:57,677 --> 01:27:00,271
Ah, ''were true,''
which it is not, probably.

1505
01:27:00,346 --> 01:27:03,543
And whoever was in charge
of developing such a thing... Whoo!

1506
01:27:03,616 --> 01:27:05,607
Not only would they
be insanely wealthy,

1507
01:27:05,685 --> 01:27:08,245
they would be immortalized
in history, right?

1508
01:27:08,321 --> 01:27:10,789
[chuckles] Yes, l suppose they would.

1509
01:27:10,856 --> 01:27:14,257
Wow. Wow. What a thrill it must be

1510
01:27:14,327 --> 01:27:16,625
to work under Dr. Strictland.

1511
01:27:16,696 --> 01:27:18,357
[sniffs]

1512
01:27:19,365 --> 01:27:20,662
'Scuse me.

1513
01:27:20,733 --> 01:27:24,032
Dr. Strictland, the creative force
at your company, right?

1514
01:27:24,103 --> 01:27:28,199
Well, it takes many different people
to contribute to the higher... [babbles]

1515
01:27:28,274 --> 01:27:30,834
[Dave] Yes, yes, yes, yes.
But what an honor it must be

1516
01:27:30,910 --> 01:27:32,969
to work in Dr. Strictland's shadow.

1517
01:27:33,045 --> 01:27:36,674
l don't work in anyone's shadow.
l wouldn't. l couldn't live with myself.

1518
01:27:36,749 --> 01:27:38,979
There's nothing wrong
being in second place.

1519
01:27:39,051 --> 01:27:41,645
Second fiddle,
second banana, second up.

1520
01:27:41,721 --> 01:27:44,315
l am the chief scientist.

1521
01:27:44,390 --> 01:27:47,484
l, me, mine! [growls]

1522
01:27:47,560 --> 01:27:49,221
[Dave] Ho! Come on.

1523
01:27:49,295 --> 01:27:51,354
Gettin' kinda agitated. What's up, dog?

1524
01:27:51,430 --> 01:27:53,898
Pick up a little virus
down there in the lab, did ya?

1525
01:27:53,966 --> 01:27:56,196
Must be something
going around. [growling]

1526
01:27:56,268 --> 01:27:58,998
[both growling, snarling]

1527
01:28:03,576 --> 01:28:05,737
[Judge Whittaker] No more growling.

1528
01:28:05,811 --> 01:28:07,836
Mr. Douglas, l have had enough.

1529
01:28:07,913 --> 01:28:10,438
He stole a sacred dog from China,
stuck needles in it

1530
01:28:10,516 --> 01:28:13,417
and almost killed this thing
for his little experiments.

1531
01:28:13,486 --> 01:28:15,477
- The witness is not on trial.
- Thank you.

1532
01:28:15,554 --> 01:28:17,181
You put your boss in a coma.

1533
01:28:17,256 --> 01:28:19,247
Escort Mr. Douglas out of the courtroom.

1534
01:28:19,325 --> 01:28:21,259
You set that fire
to cover up your crime!

1535
01:28:21,327 --> 01:28:23,261
He set that fire, and you're trying...

1536
01:28:23,329 --> 01:28:25,354
You're trying to frame Forrester for it!

1537
01:28:25,431 --> 01:28:27,661
l've seen that monkey that barks!
lt's real!

1538
01:28:27,733 --> 01:28:30,531
They've also got this rabbit
they taught how to fetch!

1539
01:28:30,603 --> 01:28:32,935
- He does!
- Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

1540
01:28:33,005 --> 01:28:35,940
please disregard everything
Mr. Douglas has said.

1541
01:28:36,008 --> 01:28:37,839
- [sighs]
- Hey!

1542
01:28:37,910 --> 01:28:40,538
Kozak! Kozak! Kozak! Go fetch!

1543
01:28:40,613 --> 01:28:42,410
Mmm! [pants]

1544
01:28:43,649 --> 01:28:45,981
[crowd murmuring]

1545
01:28:49,088 --> 01:28:51,420
[growling]

1546
01:28:52,792 --> 01:28:55,192
[panting]

1547
01:29:02,501 --> 01:29:05,095
Sorry, uh, things
are a little stressy at work,

1548
01:29:05,171 --> 01:29:06,798
long hours and the like. What?

1549
01:29:06,872 --> 01:29:08,635
What?

1550
01:29:08,707 --> 01:29:10,334
- [crowd gasping]
- What?

1551
01:29:14,713 --> 01:29:17,978
- Oh!
- [crowd gasping]

1552
01:29:18,050 --> 01:29:20,678
[Kozak grunts] Whoo!

1553
01:29:24,190 --> 01:29:26,818
[Dave] lf that isn't evidence
of genetic mutation,

1554
01:29:26,892 --> 01:29:28,086
l don't know what is!

1555
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:30,754
On second thought, bailiff,
take him into custody.

1556
01:29:30,830 --> 01:29:32,764
For what?

1557
01:29:32,832 --> 01:29:34,823
Shufflin' around a little DNA? Huh?

1558
01:29:34,900 --> 01:29:37,494
Don't you morons realize
l can make us all immortal?

1559
01:29:37,570 --> 01:29:40,061
Animals don't even understand
what's goin' on!

1560
01:29:40,139 --> 01:29:41,970
Don't tell me they don't understand.

1561
01:29:42,041 --> 01:29:44,805
Animals understand. l know different.

1562
01:29:46,312 --> 01:29:49,372
Yeah, you know. [chuckles]

1563
01:29:49,448 --> 01:29:51,439
This isn't over.
We got so much in common.

1564
01:29:51,517 --> 01:29:53,485
Let's stay in touch, huh? [growls]

1565
01:29:53,552 --> 01:29:55,679
Ooh! Are we goin' outside?

1566
01:29:59,592 --> 01:30:01,082
[chuckles]

1567
01:30:03,429 --> 01:30:05,158
l owe you an apology.

1568
01:30:05,231 --> 01:30:07,028
You got this one right, after all.

1569
01:30:07,099 --> 01:30:08,828
Thank you, Ken.

1570
01:30:08,901 --> 01:30:12,701
l don't even wanna know
how that car got here.

1571
01:30:12,771 --> 01:30:15,968
[chimpanzee hooting]

1572
01:30:16,041 --> 01:30:17,906
- Would...?
- [Dave] All right, boss,

1573
01:30:17,977 --> 01:30:21,208
l want you to set up a trust fund
to help my animal friends there.

1574
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:24,613
- Keep 'em off the highway.
- [Ken] Absolutely.

1575
01:30:26,552 --> 01:30:29,817
After today, ace, you're
a shoo-in to get elected DA.

1576
01:30:29,889 --> 01:30:32,050
- [chuckles]
- Take your kudos.

1577
01:30:32,124 --> 01:30:34,354
l have some more
important people to talk to.

1578
01:30:34,426 --> 01:30:36,894
- l'll see ya.
- Dave, congratulations on the case.

1579
01:30:36,962 --> 01:30:39,294
Thank you very much.
No, thank... You know what?

1580
01:30:39,365 --> 01:30:42,528
l will have a prepared statement
from my office. Thank you all.

1581
01:30:42,601 --> 01:30:45,399
[barking]

1582
01:30:45,471 --> 01:30:47,564
- Hey.
- Mm.

1583
01:30:47,640 --> 01:30:49,403
You made a great dog, Dad.

1584
01:30:49,475 --> 01:30:51,568
But you're gonna make
an even better DA.

1585
01:30:51,644 --> 01:30:55,580
Carly, it means the world to me
to hear you say that.

1586
01:30:55,648 --> 01:30:57,081
lt really does.

1587
01:30:57,149 --> 01:31:00,084
Josh, listen.

1588
01:31:00,152 --> 01:31:03,519
[sighs] lt took the eyes
of a dog for me to see

1589
01:31:03,589 --> 01:31:05,989
that l made it hard
for you to tell the truth.

1590
01:31:06,058 --> 01:31:09,221
The truth is, son, whatever you love

1591
01:31:09,295 --> 01:31:11,320
l'm gonna love and support too.

1592
01:31:11,397 --> 01:31:13,092
Thanks, Dad.

1593
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:16,233
[laughing] Hey.

1594
01:31:16,302 --> 01:31:19,931
Brace yourself for the old dog
in your new man.

1595
01:31:21,340 --> 01:31:24,400
Yeah. Get out that new bikini.

1596
01:31:24,476 --> 01:31:27,809
We are goin'... to Oahu.

1597
01:31:36,589 --> 01:31:39,251
Mm, Oahu. l love you.

1598
01:31:39,325 --> 01:31:40,553
l love you too.

1599
01:31:40,626 --> 01:31:42,651
Just like l promised.

1600
01:31:42,728 --> 01:31:45,094
Hey, you guys, check it out!

1601
01:31:45,164 --> 01:31:46,597

1602
01:31:46,665 --> 01:31:48,132
Will you look at that.

1603
01:31:48,200 --> 01:31:50,134
<i>[° The Beach Boys: Surfin' USA]</i>

1604
01:31:54,640 --> 01:31:56,403
- [barking]
- [Dave] Look at that.

1605
01:31:56,475 --> 01:32:00,206
Hey, folks, that is
a 300-year-old dog shootin' a curl.

1606
01:32:00,279 --> 01:32:01,576
Attaboy!

1607
01:32:06,552 --> 01:32:08,884
[barking, howling]

1608
01:32:10,155 --> 01:32:12,350
Oh, l wish he didn't have
to go back to Tibet.

1609
01:32:12,424 --> 01:32:14,153
Yeah.

1610
01:32:14,226 --> 01:32:15,818
[Josh] Hey, Dad! Catch!

1611
01:32:17,029 --> 01:32:20,897
