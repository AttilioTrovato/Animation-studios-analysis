1
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,276
- I'm gettin' somethin' on the sonar!
- What is it?

2
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:30,238
Strong reading from
underneath the cap rock, sir!

3
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:32,949
- Possible oil flow?
- Still analyzing.

4
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,956
It's...

5
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,792
Sounds like...

6
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:48,548
Tiny hammers.

7
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:22,039
Let's go skating!

8
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:12,358
- They're coming right at us!
- Take us to Elfcon 3!

9
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:13,943
Take us to Elfcon 3.

10
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:35,047
These guys aren't stopping.

11
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:37,967
- Take us to Elfcon 2!
- Let's go to Elfcon 2.

12
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:19,508
We have a partridge in a pear tree.

13
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:23,846
You take us to Elfcon 1.
Let's rig for silent running.

14
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:27,058
- Look alive, everybody!
- Okay, we're at Elfcon 1.

15
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:59,465
- I lost it!
- What do you mean, you lost it?

16
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,133
Wait!

17
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,553
What the...

18
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,893
Sir, you're gonna want to hear this.

19
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:15,481
You better watch out

20
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,775
You better not cry

21
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:20,403
You better not pout
and I'm telling you why

22
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:21,904
Find out where
that music's coming from.

23
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:22,989
Okay.

24
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:35,751
Santa, I've got her on the locator.

25
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,932
He knows when you are sleeping

26
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,602
He knows when you're awake

27
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:58,232
He knows if you've been bad or good

28
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:01,027
So be good for goodness'...

29
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:02,695
Yeah, yeah, yeah

30
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,530
You better watch out

31
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,574
You better not cry

32
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:08,367
You better not pout

33
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:10,661
- And I'm telling you why
- Whoo!

34
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:15,291
Santa Claus is coming to...

35
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:20,713
- What now?
- It's just gone.

36
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,089
In the middle of the chorus!

37
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:24,258
Nobody needs to know about this.

38
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:28,095
Maybe we should mention
the Smokey Robinson thing, sir.

39
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:31,015
We're at Elfcon 4. All clear.

40
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:35,102
Curtis, what do you say we get
you headphones this Christmas?

41
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:38,314
It's all right, everybody.
Let's get back to work.

42
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:41,650
Curtis, you're 900 years old. Grow up!

43
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,487
Bernard.

44
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,578
You know I didn't break any of the rules,

45
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,330
according to The Santa Handbook.

46
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:57,625
The handbook! Curtis, do you go
pee-pee with that thing?

47
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:00,586
It says elves are encouraged
to listen to music.

48
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:05,549
It makes them more creative,
more productive and more alert.

49
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,134
Look out!

50
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,480
- It's okay.
- Let's go!

51
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:23,192
- Is he all right?
- He's okay, Santa.

52
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,568
Wow.

53
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:27,279
That's gonna leave a mark. Ooh.

54
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,740
Is that Blitzen? Looks like Prancer.

55
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,201
- Who is that?
- It was Chet.

56
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:34,245
A reindeer in training.

57
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:36,205
Oh.

58
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,042
Well, please tell me
that it's early in his training.

59
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,128
Wow! Nice fall.

60
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:45,506
Curtis, when are you gonna tell him?

61
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,258
Not now!

62
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,448
It's so cold up here.
How can you not be freezing?

63
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:14,577
You have not seen cold
till you see where my dad lives. It's...

64
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:17,663
Don't be embarrassed.
My parents are divorced.

65
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,290
- No big deal.
- I'm not embarrassed.

66
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:21,876
- Why don't you talk about your dad?
- He doesn't like me to.

67
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,253
- It's complicated.
- Is he a spy?

68
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,796
No, he...

69
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:28,549
He works with toys and these

70
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:32,011
little people. Kids.

71
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,306
Can we just do
what we came here to do?

72
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:36,765
Sure.

73
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,105
All right.

74
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:46,442
Charlie, this is really dangerous.

75
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,943
Someone could catch us
at any moment.

76
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,488
Kinda exciting.

77
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:55,367
Well, you know, Danielle,
I may not come out of this alive.

78
00:08:56,912 --> 00:08:59,538
So, in case
we don't see each other again...

79
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:04,710
Whoa!

80
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:11,008
Are you okay?

81
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:15,846
Whew!

82
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,829
- Almost done.
- Okay. I'm not leaving.

83
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,211
I've been a naughty boy

84
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:51,423
I didn't get a toy

85
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:56,929
Santa Claus left nothing
Underneath my tree

86
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:01,433
He knows that I've been bad

87
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:04,728
But being good just ain't my bag...

88
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:17,866
Hello, Charlie.

89
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,453
Hello, Principal Newman.

90
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,961
Okay, try it now.

91
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:36,051
Okay, all right. Here's what we need.

92
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:40,472
Get one more bolt on that flange,
and it's ready for Christmas.

93
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,850
Good work, guys. Whew!

94
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:47,521
Perfect job on suspension, you guys.
Thinkin' outside the box. I love it.

95
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:54,945
- Do you want a cookie, Santa?
- Do I want a cookie?

96
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,031
Yes! What's fresh?

97
00:10:57,699 --> 00:10:58,866
Ooh!

98
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:00,743
Sweet, just like you.

99
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,878
Alexander, let's think.

100
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:12,963
Take the hat off.

101
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:17,176
Too much counterweight.

102
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:20,179
Thanks, Santa. You're the man.

103
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:23,140
That's why they give me the big belly,
so I don't fall over!

104
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:28,771
Hey, Joey!
How's that static-free tinsel coming?

105
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:32,274
Hey, guys, Santa wants
to see the new tinsel.

106
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:43,494
I could come up there
and take care of this the ugly way.

107
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:48,290
Or we go outside
and play some football.

108
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:55,464
Curtis, you need to tell him right now!

109
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,759
I don't know. He's so happy right now.

110
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,095
And why do I have to be the one
to tell him?

111
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:04,556
Because I'm the head elf.
I don't give bad news.

112
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:06,767
It's one of the perks of my seniority.

113
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,394
Now, tell him!

114
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,708
Come on, pork chop. Bring it on.

115
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,837
Who you callin' pork chop, meatloaf?

116
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:36,547
Meatloaf?

117
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:39,299
You wanna talk some trash?
I'll talk trash with ya.

118
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:42,928
- But first, I'm gonna blitz.
- Ready, set!

119
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:46,598
- I'm comin' after you, buddy.
- Seven swans a-swimming!

120
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:48,517
Six geese a-laying!

121
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:51,687
Five golden rings!

122
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,188
Hike!

123
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:57,276
Hey, who's got the ball?
I can see it. Let go of me.

124
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,612
He's too quick! He spins!
He moves! He's on the way!

125
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:03,449
And he might go all the

126
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,201
way! Whoo!

127
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,704
Rumblin', stumblin', bumblin'!

128
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:10,956
They pile on!

129
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:16,879
Okay, you win!

130
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:26,889
You guys aren't elves. You're wizards!

131
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:30,142
No matter how many times you run
that play, I never see it comin'.

132
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,769
Santa? We need to talk.

133
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,366
- That's weird, isn't it?
- Uh-oh.

134
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:49,411
- These fit yesterday.
- Hot cocoa for you.

135
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,663
This is not a good time, Abby.

136
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:55,000
I sent Dasher down
for some Brazilian cocoa beans.

137
00:13:57,045 --> 00:14:00,088
- What's the bad news?
- What do you mean?

138
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:05,219
Whenever you play the designer
bean card, you have bad news.

139
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,683
What are you doing
with the naughty-and-nice list?

140
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:13,602
Don't shoot the messenger.

141
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:21,193
- It's Charlie.
- Sheen?

142
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:24,530
- I thought he straightened out.
- Not that Charlie.

143
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:32,621
My Charlie. My son Charlie?
He's on the naughty list?

144
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,793
- There's gotta be a mistake.
- We don't make mistakes.

145
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:41,588
I'm sorry, Santa. Please excuse me.

146
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:46,635
How could this happen?
Is this what you were trying to tell me?

147
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,805
Great! You told him!
Let's get you dressed for that meeting.

148
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:53,308
I can't have the meeting here.
I'm gonna have to see Charlie.

149
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:57,813
- Number two, tell him now.
- Tell me what, guys? Come clean.

150
00:14:58,273 --> 00:15:00,899
- Santa, there's a clause.
- That would be me.

151
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:03,569
No, I mean there's another
Santa clause.

152
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:06,238
Curtis, in case you haven't noticed,
this time of year,

153
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,657
the malls are filled
with other "Santa Clauses."

154
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:11,702
Yes, but there's another Santa clause.

155
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,663
There was a first clause,
but also a second clause.

156
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,373
Get on with it!

157
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:22,170
When the last Santa fell off your roof
and you put on his coat, you found this.

158
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:24,756
Right. "He who wears the coat

159
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:28,260
"takes on the responsibilities
of Santa Claus."

160
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,345
And the rest would be history, right?

161
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:35,309
But it seems our number two elf,
the keeper of the handbook,

162
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:39,771
overlooked the single
most important detail

163
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:41,523
in the history of Christmas!

164
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,275
Wow.

165
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,485
One mistake in 900 years.

166
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:47,821
Look.

167
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:51,033
- I can't see that.
- Better now?

168
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,744
- Or now?
- Well...

169
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:55,621
- Better now?
- It's gettin' there.

170
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:58,040
- Or now?
- I can't see anything.

171
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:02,419
I see. Good, good, good. I see it. Okay.

172
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:06,048
"The card holder acknowledges
a woman of his choosing...

173
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:10,844
"True love...
Not valid in the state of Utah...

174
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:12,387
"Holy...

175
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:16,141
"Matrimony"?

176
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,894
- I gotta get married!
- Yes.

177
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,605
It's the Mrs. Clause.

178
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,694
What if I don't want to get married?

179
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,199
Oh, dear. The de-Santification
process has begun!

180
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:34,826
The de-Santification?

181
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,123
Are you telling me that clause
says if I don't get married,

182
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:43,418
I don't get to be Santa anymore?

183
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:51,510
What about the kids?

184
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:53,553
What about the elves?

185
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:58,642
- What about you guys?
- It's not completely hopeless.

186
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,644
You still have time to find a wife.

187
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,605
- How much time do I have?
- 28 days.

188
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:08,610
28 days? So I've gotta find
a wife by Christmas.

189
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:10,487
Actually, Christmas Eve.

190
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:17,994
- I guess it's over.
- No! You can't think that way!

191
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,497
Please, don't give up hope.

192
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:25,252
'Cause if you do, then we have to.

193
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:38,640
Whoa!

194
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:43,145
Christmas is getting very complicated.

195
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,981
Santa?

196
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:47,983
Santa?

197
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:52,070
- Are you with us?
- I'm sorry, yes. Yes, I am.

198
00:17:52,155 --> 00:17:57,200
Well, on behalf of Father Time and
the Council of Legendary Figures,

199
00:17:57,577 --> 00:18:00,245
I'd like to thank you
for being such a gracious host.

200
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,289
- Hear, hear.
- What a lovely place.

201
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:06,543
Without further ado, let us convene
the year-end conference.

202
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:10,088
- Tooth Fairy.
- Thank you, Mother Nature.

203
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:12,048
Fellow council members,

204
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:15,051
I'd like to again propose
a new name for myself.

205
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:17,471
- Oh, please!
- Good heavens!

206
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:22,100
In the past, you have rejected
Tooth Man, Tooth Guy and Tooth.

207
00:18:22,185 --> 00:18:24,978
- Because they stunk.
- Today, I'd like to submit

208
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:27,230
- Captain Floss.
- Nice!

209
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:28,482
Plaque Man.

210
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:31,777
- And Roy.
- Roy! No.

211
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:35,530
No kid's gonna put a tooth
under a pillow for a man named Roy.

212
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:38,450
This from someone in a diaper
who shoots people's butts!

213
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,702
Wait a minute. I got it. I got it. I got it.

214
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:43,455
Now, how about this? The Molarnator.

215
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:46,041
The Molarnator! I like it.

216
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:48,543
Thank you, Santa.
Can we vote now on the Molarnator?

217
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:51,254
All in favor of a name change
for Tooth Fairy?

218
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:54,424
All right. And all opposed?

219
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:56,968
Easter Bunny?

220
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:00,555
- Sandman?
- What...

221
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,391
What happened? Was I asleep again?

222
00:19:04,227 --> 00:19:07,062
Name change for the Tooth Fairy.
Yes or no?

223
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:09,147
No. I'm sorry.

224
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:13,485
All right. Next item on the agenda.
Santa? Status report.

225
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:17,405
Okay. First, welcome to the North Pole.
Great to have you here.

226
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:20,826
This is our big time of year,
so things are busy as usual.

227
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,995
There's a little speed bump
in the road this year.

228
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,666
- You all know Charlie.
- Oh! I love Charlie!

229
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,251
- Great kid.
- Good boy.

230
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:30,752
- Sweet kid.
- Good teeth.

231
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:34,589
Well, Charlie got himself
on the naughty list.

232
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:36,508
- What?
- Oh, my!

233
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:39,135
I'm struggling with the timing,
'cause it's...

234
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:42,472
I gotta be up here and
I've also got to take care of Charlie...

235
00:19:42,557 --> 00:19:44,683
That's every parent's dilemma,

236
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,769
how to balance work and children.

237
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:50,146
Most people lose sleep over that.

238
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:55,110
Tell me about it! I have 33,000
offspring. All in private school.

239
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,155
Well, to top it off,

240
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:01,741
I have to get married by Christmas Eve.

241
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,369
- What?
- Otherwise I stop being Santa.

242
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:05,954
- What?
- No!

243
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,623
The de-Santification process
has already begun.

244
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,458
Wait a minute.

245
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,544
You do look thinner, and...

246
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:15,881
- Your beard is shorter! Right?
- You're right!

247
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:19,092
Apparently, it's called the Mrs. Clause.

248
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:21,469
Don't mess with me, Santa.
I'm pre-El Niño.

249
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:24,681
No, I'm not messing with anybody.
What I'm saying is,

250
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:26,933
I have to find a wife in...

251
00:20:27,018 --> 00:20:31,396
27 days, 20 hours and 17 minutes.

252
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,564
Wow.

253
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:34,399
It's what I do.

254
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:38,111
Wait a minute. Cupid!
Cupid, come over here.

255
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,530
- What do you need?
- Shoot me with a dart.

256
00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:43,909
- Then I'll fall in love.
- First of all, they're arrows.

257
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:45,702
Second of all, no can do.

258
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:48,246
- Why not?
- Arrows have no effect on us.

259
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:51,708
If they did, I would have shot myself,
met a nice girl,

260
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,501
left the business years ago.

261
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:56,630
- Enough with the questions.
- You can't stop being Santa.

262
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:58,173
I don't want to.

263
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:01,092
Kids are 86% happier
since you've taken the job.

264
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:03,470
- He's right.
- This is all I want to do.

265
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,764
But what am I gonna do?

266
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:08,850
Well, you...

267
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:11,895
You can't be two places at once.

268
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:15,315
Maybe you can be.

269
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,985
Okay, everyone, can I get the room
for a minute? Thank you.

270
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:21,780
Can I just... One minute.
Take a cocoa break.

271
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:23,949
Have a nice long break.
Relax, everyone.

272
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:27,494
I want to show Santa
some improvements on the pantograph.

273
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:29,913
Thanks. Walk with me.

274
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:32,916
I've tripled the RAM
and reconfigured the circuitry.

275
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:37,003
I see you've externalized
the power source

276
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:39,714
to make better use
of the electromagnetic energy.

277
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:42,384
No, it's just there
'cause it looks really cool.

278
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,219
Yeah, it does.

279
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:46,930
Wait a minute. You tripled the RAM.

280
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:50,475
I see where this is going.
I am not getting in that machine.

281
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,646
Besides, creating a copy of Santa
won't solve our problems.

282
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:59,317
- The elves'll know.
- But this would be a special toy!

283
00:21:59,402 --> 00:22:02,904
- How's that, Curtis?
- I added a fuzzy logic circuit.

284
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,407
The duplicate will look
and think just like you.

285
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:09,244
When you're with your family,
dealing with Charlie, looking for a wife...

286
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:12,330
The toy will be up here melting
in front of my fireplace.

287
00:22:12,415 --> 00:22:15,500
No, the toy Santa will be dealing
with business up here.

288
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,460
I can deal with business up here.

289
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:20,755
Santa, if the elves find out
we've made a switch...

290
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,675
No! No! This machine is not the answer.

291
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:30,056
Hey! Hey! Hey! You! You! Shoo!

292
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,101
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

293
00:22:53,456 --> 00:22:55,665
Look, you can't get
much better than that.

294
00:22:56,834 --> 00:23:00,128
And I promise, it won't hurt a bit.

295
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:08,553
- I'm goin' in.
- Oh, I can't watch this!

296
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:42,712
Ow! Ow!

297
00:24:04,527 --> 00:24:06,111
It's perfect!

298
00:24:08,531 --> 00:24:10,698
That's because it's me, Einstein.

299
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:15,787
- Santa, are you all right?
- Yeah, I got a shock in there.

300
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:16,996
Is there supposed to be a shock?

301
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:23,211
It's naked!

302
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:29,050
Throw something over it.

303
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:32,178
- It's incredible!
- Yes, it is.

304
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:38,268
Can he talk?

305
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,230
Hello?

306
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:49,571
Hello?

307
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:57,579
Ho, ho, ho!

308
00:24:58,122 --> 00:25:00,540
- Not bad.
- Not bad yourself.

309
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:04,752
I can't put my finger on it,

310
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:06,588
but there's something
about you that I like.

311
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:09,424
There's something about you that I like!

312
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:12,427
Hah.

313
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,054
Watch him. I'll be right back.

314
00:25:15,306 --> 00:25:17,056
He's coming right back.

315
00:25:18,601 --> 00:25:20,143
Ha-ha-ha!

316
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:23,104
- Bernard, I need your help.
- What do you mean?

317
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:27,358
What I mean is I gotta go see Charlie,
and I want you to convince the elves

318
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:30,028
that toy Santa is me.

319
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,739
- Hmm. Have you seen that thing?
- I've seen it.

320
00:25:32,823 --> 00:25:35,533
Keep the elves at a distance and say

321
00:25:35,618 --> 00:25:37,118
that I've changed my look, it'll work.

322
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:40,705
Oh, Santa, we're in way over
our heads here.

323
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:43,041
If anybody can do this,
it's you, number one.

324
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:45,960
I'm not gonna lie to all the elves.

325
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:49,964
I myself think he looks
absolutely terrific!

326
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:53,468
Better and fresher somehow
than he has in years.

327
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:56,554
There's now a more supple veneer
to his skin

328
00:25:56,639 --> 00:25:58,973
and an added luster
to the thickness of his hair.

329
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:01,434
You could almost say there's a...

330
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:04,020
A toy-like quality to him.

331
00:26:04,647 --> 00:26:07,815
Most importantly,
he's very happy with his new look,

332
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:11,402
and I would caution you all
not to point or stare

333
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:13,446
or use the word "plastic."

334
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,156
Okay? Okay.

335
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:18,034
Thank you. That's all.
Back to work, please.

336
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:28,628
Comet, because I don't want
to take Prancer.

337
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:32,674
I want to take a trip with you.
When's the last time we had a cruise?

338
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:34,926
I love you, buddy.

339
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:38,888
Besides, Prancer had too many apples.
We know what that means.

340
00:26:38,973 --> 00:26:41,474
Before you go,
take a look at your watch.

341
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:43,601
Hey! Can't go anywhere without that.

342
00:26:43,686 --> 00:26:47,105
- I've done some work on it.
- It's beautiful. It really is.

343
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:51,025
- You like it?
- The workmanship's fabulous.

344
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:54,237
It has a power reserve that measures
how much magic you have left.

345
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:56,281
- It's at 10.
- That should be enough.

346
00:26:56,490 --> 00:27:00,702
But if you use up any magic
for any reason, the level drops.

347
00:27:01,245 --> 00:27:03,538
Santa, if it gets to zero,

348
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:06,165
you won't be able to return to the Pole.

349
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:08,209
Uh-oh.

350
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:11,963
Then let's not let it get to zero!

351
00:27:12,506 --> 00:27:15,049
- Now, look at me.
- Mmm-hmm.

352
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:18,678
What's the most important thing?

353
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:21,097
For you not to touch Santa?

354
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,933
For you to come back!

355
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,312
Thank you.

356
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:30,940
Comet, please
just chill out a little bit, okay?

357
00:27:31,025 --> 00:27:35,236
Come on! It's not like
we're pullin' the sleigh. Right?

358
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:37,322
There's no packages. It's one stop.

359
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:39,907
And I think I might have forgot
we're gonna go see Charlie.

360
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:55,923
Scott! Hey! You trimmed your beard.

361
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:57,300
Yeah.

362
00:27:57,843 --> 00:27:59,677
Come here, big guy.

363
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:04,390
Whoa. Lost some weight there, huh?
Slim-Fast?

364
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:05,600
You don't know how fast.

365
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:07,643
- We should get going.
- Oh, okay.

366
00:28:07,728 --> 00:28:09,937
How do you always know
when there's a problem?

367
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:13,024
I see you when you're sleepin'.
I know when you're awake.

368
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:16,110
Which is a pretty frightening concept
when you think about it.

369
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:18,696
We're really worried about Charlie.

370
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:22,450
He keeps upping the ante.
This time he defaced school property.

371
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:25,453
- It's classic acting out.
- I'm blaming myself for this.

372
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:28,331
- We're both his parents.
- Where is he?

373
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:30,833
He's waiting for us
in Principal Newman's office.

374
00:28:30,918 --> 00:28:34,295
Something about her makes me
want to deface public property.

375
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:37,799
Hello, Mr. Calvin. Laura, Neil.

376
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:40,551
- Miss Newman.
- Principal Newman.

377
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:43,304
Haven't seen you since
the last time Charlie was in trouble.

378
00:28:43,514 --> 00:28:45,348
I've been traveling for work.

379
00:28:45,808 --> 00:28:49,227
Oh. If you spent more time with your
son, there'd be fewer problems.

380
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:51,854
Then I wouldn't spend
so much time with you,

381
00:28:51,939 --> 00:28:53,731
- which is always such a pleasure.
- Oh.

382
00:28:53,816 --> 00:28:57,819
A battle of wits. It's a shame
you come unarmed. Excuse me.

383
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:59,237
Ouch.

384
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:04,659
Good morning, Principal Newman.

385
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:08,496
Mr. Picardo, I want you to look
into my eyes. What do you see?

386
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,583
It's dark. And it's cold.

387
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:15,503
It's your future, Mr. Picardo.
Keep this up

388
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:18,005
and you will spend your life
stabbing trash.

389
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,674
- Do I make myself clear?
- Yes.

390
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,760
- So what are you gonna do?
- I'm going to geometry.

391
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:24,720
Have a nice trip.

392
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:34,814
It's an affront to authority
and blatant disrespect for property.

393
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:38,067
If this continues, I'll have no other
recourse than to suspend...

394
00:29:38,152 --> 00:29:41,571
Excuse me. Is there a rest stop between
here and the end of the lecture?

395
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:45,158
I'm more interested in why
this happened in the first place.

396
00:29:45,242 --> 00:29:48,786
So am I.
Charlie, we're all worried about you.

397
00:29:48,871 --> 00:29:51,998
It feels like you're trying
to get someone's attention.

398
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,083
What's bothering you?

399
00:29:58,088 --> 00:29:59,630
- Dr. Miller?
- Neil.

400
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:03,843
- Neil, any theories?
- Well, frankly, I have several.

401
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:06,304
Here we go. Let's just order a pizza.

402
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:07,722
- Scott, you're not helping.
- Ugh!

403
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:12,268
I was listening to a tape series
on child development last night.

404
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:17,106
You know what the problem is?
Excuse me, Neil.

405
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:20,485
It's four weeks until Christmas.

406
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:22,987
- That's a holiday in December.
- Oh.

407
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:27,283
Have you noticed the hallways?
Not a decoration, not a twinkle light,

408
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:31,078
not an expression of the joy
kids are supposed to be feeling.

409
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:34,999
- What kind of school is this?
- A public school.

410
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:39,962
A top-rated public school.
That takes effort. And money.

411
00:30:40,047 --> 00:30:43,049
Spending any of that money
on holiday decorations

412
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:45,510
would take away
from the things that truly matter.

413
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:47,720
Forgive me, but I think
holiday cheer really matters.

414
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:50,598
What are we going to do?
We are worried...

415
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:54,101
Let me handle this.
You know what you did is wrong. Right?

416
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,103
- I guess so.
- There's no guessing.

417
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:58,773
Guessing is gone.
It was wrong what you did.

418
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:01,025
And you're not gonna do it again.
Promise me.

419
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:03,361
- Okay.
- There you go.

420
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:06,364
He won't do it again.
Meeting is adjourned.

421
00:31:06,448 --> 00:31:08,866
It most certainly is not! Charlie...

422
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:11,369
You know what else?
Here's a little donation.

423
00:31:11,453 --> 00:31:12,912
Why don't you buy yourself a wreath?

424
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:19,627
I am Santa Claus. Boo!

425
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:23,589
Yeah. No, no,
I think that this is gonna work.

426
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:25,967
Good job, Curtis.

427
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:29,387
Would it kill you
to give a wholehearted compliment?

428
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:30,680
Ho, ho, ho.

429
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:32,890
- Ho, ho, ho.
- Santa?

430
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:38,437
- I need you to look at this.
- All right!

431
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:40,898
Nice!

432
00:31:40,983 --> 00:31:42,650
No. I mean, I need you to read it.

433
00:31:42,943 --> 00:31:45,528
Well, let's try to be specific, shall we?

434
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:49,407
I'll take a look at it over at my desk.

435
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:53,578
- How does he know where it is?
- I programed him that way.

436
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:55,788
He has most of Santa's memories.

437
00:31:56,707 --> 00:32:00,209
Okay, we need you to study
everything that's in that book

438
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:03,629
because it is the key to being Santa.

439
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:07,842
Right! I'll memorize everything
in the book.

440
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,678
I'll follow all the rules.

441
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:14,473
'Cause rules are very important!

442
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:17,518
- I like this guy.
- I can barely read this.

443
00:32:17,603 --> 00:32:19,020
Hi, Santa.

444
00:32:21,148 --> 00:32:23,941
- Hi.
- Oh. You look...

445
00:32:24,026 --> 00:32:26,444
Like he got a good night's sleep.

446
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:33,534
Like you got a very good night's sleep.

447
00:32:34,328 --> 00:32:36,162
How about a nice chocolatey cocoa?

448
00:32:51,637 --> 00:32:54,347
- Careful, it's hot.
- Of course it is.

449
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:10,404
Ah!

450
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,909
Whoa!

451
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:19,080
That's delicious! I like cocoa!

452
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:21,791
Cocoa's superior refreshment!

453
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:25,419
Get me some more cocoa! Whoo!

454
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:27,088
Right away, Santa.

455
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:28,923
Oh! Whoa!

456
00:33:29,466 --> 00:33:31,926
I think Santa feels a little buzz!

457
00:33:32,803 --> 00:33:34,261
Whoo!

458
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:38,599
Let me get this straight.
You were de-Santified?

459
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:42,436
And you only have 27 days
to find a wife or you're out?

460
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:44,855
Yeah.

461
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,525
What are you gonna do?
We dated for three years

462
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:49,944
before you got up the courage
to propose.

463
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:53,197
That's a pretty serious
commitment issue, isn't it?

464
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:56,158
Yes, Sigmund.
I was afraid I'd mess up the first time.

465
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:58,619
- I'm more afraid now.
- Dad, you can't give up.

466
00:33:58,704 --> 00:34:00,496
There's never been a better Santa.

467
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,164
I appreciate that.

468
00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:05,376
It's for the best.
If I had spent more time with you,

469
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,837
you'd spend less time
in the spray paint industry.

470
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:10,673
Don't do that to yourself.
You have been a great dad.

471
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:13,217
And being Santa has made you
an even better man.

472
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:15,553
I'm gonna go out on an emotional limb.

473
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:17,346
Don't try to make me cry.

474
00:34:17,431 --> 00:34:21,392
Believe it or not,
you have a great capacity for love.

475
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:25,479
I know you can find someone wonderful
to spend the rest of your life with.

476
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:29,233
Don't let the facts that you
have no time, no prospects

477
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:32,319
and a paralyzing fear
of intimacy get you down.

478
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:33,904
Hmm.

479
00:34:34,281 --> 00:34:36,157
Have you ever helped anyone? Ever?

480
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:39,577
You know what I'm gonna do?
I am gonna look through my phone book

481
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:42,413
and see who's still single out there
and not too bitter.

482
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:45,791
There's divorced moms at school
who'll go out with anybody.

483
00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:49,503
As promising as this sounds,
I don't need help with this area.

484
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:53,007
Your old man was a high-school legend.
A double Letterman.

485
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,842
I had a Mustang.

486
00:34:55,177 --> 00:34:56,761
So as far as dating goes,

487
00:34:56,845 --> 00:35:01,015
I think if anybody can stir up
the old mojo, it would be moi.

488
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:03,809
Come on! I don't think
there's a woman out there

489
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:05,895
that doesn't want a piece of this.

490
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:12,193
- Hi, Mom!
- Lucy!

491
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:15,696
- Uncle Scott!
- How's my little sweet pea?

492
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,741
Oh, I haven't seen you in a long time.

493
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:23,370
- Tell me what's been happenin'.
- I learned to swim underwater.

494
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:26,499
- And I'm not afraid!
- That's amazing!

495
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:30,711
Maybe we'll have to go to the mall
and get some ice cream.

496
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,964
- Plenty of women at the mall.
- Charlie!

497
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:38,427
Santa, look forward
and put on a smiley face.

498
00:35:38,512 --> 00:35:39,720
Say hello to your elves.

499
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:43,224
Ho, ho, ho!
You're doing a wonderful job!

500
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:47,895
Santa, when you said the bigger
wheels, is this what you meant?

501
00:35:49,231 --> 00:35:52,066
Ho, ho, ho!
You're doing a wonderful job!

502
00:35:52,943 --> 00:35:55,820
You're doing great.
Dial it down on the ho-ho-ho's,

503
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:57,696
but otherwise, you're gold.

504
00:35:57,781 --> 00:35:59,657
Ho, ho, ho!

505
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:03,410
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

506
00:36:05,038 --> 00:36:08,999
Why don't you just say it?
"You were right, Curtis. I was wrong."

507
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:11,252
Okay, okay, I admit it.

508
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,754
They're happy. They're working hard.

509
00:36:14,256 --> 00:36:16,131
Everything's going to be fine.

510
00:36:16,216 --> 00:36:18,300
This book is very interesting reading.

511
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:21,178
There's a lot of rules
they're not following.

512
00:36:21,263 --> 00:36:23,264
That's what I've been saying all along.

513
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:26,684
Things have gotten a little too sloppy
around here.

514
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:31,230
Yes! Sloppiness means mistakes.
Mistakes aren't a good thing!

515
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,318
I might have to make
some changes here.

516
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:38,612
- What do you have in mind?
- Let me show you.

517
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:41,782
There's many things. Look here...

518
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:46,453
Neil, are you sure you don't have
any other clothes I can borrow?

519
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:49,206
I mean, the idea tonight
is to attract a woman.

520
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:52,334
- What are you talking about?
- I look like a limesicle.

521
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:54,461
I think it makes you look hot.

522
00:36:54,671 --> 00:36:57,131
What do you think, Laura?
Honestly, what do you think? Huh?

523
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,632
Doesn't he look hot, Laura?

524
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:02,011
I think it's what's inside
that really counts.

525
00:37:02,596 --> 00:37:04,388
- Thought you liked the sweater.
- We'll talk later.

526
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,807
I'm off. I may need to borrow a car.

527
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:09,560
I'm parked behind Neil.
The minivan, I just had it washed.

528
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:12,730
The minivan.

529
00:37:13,315 --> 00:37:15,774
Okay, then. Well, wish me luck.

530
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:18,903
I got a needlepoint sweater
and a minivan.

531
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:21,822
See ya in about eight minutes.

532
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:34,335
Scott? Hey.

533
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:35,669
- Tracy!
- Yes!

534
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:39,256
- It's nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

535
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:42,676
- Here, why don't you sit down?
- Oh, thank you.

536
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:45,012
Thank you very much.

537
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:51,185
So, I'm so glad we finally got to do this.

538
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,520
- I'm pretty nervous.
- Oh. Are you?

539
00:37:54,147 --> 00:37:55,940
Laura says we have a lot in common.

540
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:58,317
I hear that you love
this time of year also?

541
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:00,611
It's my favorite time of year
and my busiest time of year.

542
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:03,739
- Whoa. Look at the sweater!
- Yeah!

543
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:07,576
Some sweater. Like I should talk!

544
00:38:07,911 --> 00:38:10,537
I also have my Christmas
charm bracelet.

545
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:14,083
- That's beautiful. Look at 'em!
- Yeah.

546
00:38:14,376 --> 00:38:16,669
I wear it all year long
just to keep the spirit alive.

547
00:38:16,962 --> 00:38:21,090
That's gorgeous. A little teddy bear
and packages. That's very nice.

548
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:27,638
- So what work do you do?
- I'm in the toy business.

549
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:29,640
- No way!
- Way!

550
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:35,771
- That sounds so creative.
- I love it.

551
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:38,565
- I love creative people.
- Yeah?

552
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,150
Yeah.

553
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:44,905
So what do you do?

554
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:47,700
I'm hoping someday to break
into the music business.

555
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:50,244
- As a singer-songwriter.
- No way!

556
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,495
Way!

557
00:38:53,373 --> 00:38:55,791
- What's your favorite music?
- Country-western.

558
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:58,002
- Oh!
- Yeah.

559
00:38:58,086 --> 00:38:59,586
- Do you like Shania Twain?
- Yeah!

560
00:39:01,423 --> 00:39:05,426
The best thing about
singing at Christmas

561
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:08,637
Is the cocoa, caroling and fun

562
00:39:08,722 --> 00:39:09,805
- You know that one?
- I know that song.

563
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:11,056
Whoah-oh-oh!

564
00:39:11,141 --> 00:39:12,850
Go totally yuletide

565
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:14,560
Takin' a sleigh ride

566
00:39:14,644 --> 00:39:15,644
You're good.

567
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:17,438
Santa shirts, reindeer skirts

568
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:18,522
Whoah-oh-oh!

569
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:19,690
Hey!

570
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:23,527
Watchin' the windows fog
drinkin' some eggnog

571
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:24,862
That's good.

572
00:39:24,946 --> 00:39:26,196
Whoah-oh-oh!

573
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:28,115
Fill up a stocking

574
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:30,117
Spray on some flocking

575
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:33,120
Put up a tree! Sports on TV!

576
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,164
Uh, whoah-oh-oh

577
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:39,877
I want to be free
yeah, to feel the way I feel

578
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:41,879
Ah, ah, ah, ah

579
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:43,130
Man!

580
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,424
I feel like some Christmas

581
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:50,345
Oh-oh, wow wow wow!

582
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:58,687
Whew!

583
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,900
You hated it?

584
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:04,485
It kind of scared me a little bit.

585
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:08,489
No, I just. I...

586
00:40:08,615 --> 00:40:11,784
I just... I wasn't prepared
for a performance, so if I...

587
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:15,704
I put myself out and that was
not an easy thing to do.

588
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:18,082
If you can't support a woman's ambition,

589
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:20,501
then I don't think there's any reason
to continue this date.

590
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:26,590
- Dad?
- Hey, sport.

591
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:28,425
How'd it go?

592
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:29,843
Well...

593
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:34,431
Let's just say
I'm not bookin' a church yet.

594
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:39,186
Boy, I'll tell ya,
women are hard to figure out.

595
00:40:39,354 --> 00:40:42,272
- Tell me about it.
- You too, huh? Girl trouble?

596
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:46,235
- Well, there's this one girl.
- Mmm.

597
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:49,363
We just used to be friends
and hang out at the mall and stuff.

598
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,116
Then one day, I looked at her,

599
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,701
and I got this weird feeling
in the pit of my stomach.

600
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:58,997
I started worrying about what to wear
and what my hair looked like.

601
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:02,668
And then I wanted to kiss her.

602
00:41:04,254 --> 00:41:06,255
How did she do that?

603
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:08,257
I don't know. But they all can do that.

604
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:13,512
Look at that. The snow globe!

605
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:17,641
This is so beautiful. I remember
when Bernard gave this to you.

606
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:19,726
He said all I have to do
to see you is shake it.

607
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:24,273
Now, all you have to do
is yell down the hall.

608
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,400
And I'm there whenever you need me.

609
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:28,735
Yeah.

610
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:32,281
I'm a little tired, Dad.
I'll see you in the morning.

611
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:36,660
Okay.

612
00:41:36,953 --> 00:41:38,704
- Good night.
- Night.

613
00:41:39,873 --> 00:41:42,291
Can you turn the light off, please?

614
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:44,668
Yeah, 'cause
it's such a big reach for you!

615
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,596
What do you mean it's not straight?

616
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:00,601
- Sure, it's straight.
- Uh-uh.

617
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,269
Maybe your head's crooked.

618
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:07,608
- Prancer's not this picky.
- Yes, he is.

619
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:10,235
- Hi, Comet.
- Hi!

620
00:42:13,114 --> 00:42:14,990
I've got something for you.

621
00:42:15,742 --> 00:42:17,868
Hey, Lucy, what have you got there?

622
00:42:19,287 --> 00:42:21,830
Careful with the sweets.
He tends to overeat.

623
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:24,666
Uncle Scott, are you Santa Claus?

624
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:27,419
What? Why would you ask me
something like that?

625
00:42:27,712 --> 00:42:30,422
'Cause you have a reindeer,
and only Santa has reindeer.

626
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:33,008
Nonsense.
A lot of people have reindeer.

627
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:34,134
Name five.

628
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:41,391
Well, most of them live in Finland.
I can't pronounce their names.

629
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:48,148
Besides, reindeer are too stupid
to make good pets.

630
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:52,236
Well, I think you're very smart.

631
00:42:57,325 --> 00:42:59,993
Well, I think he's learning
at an excellent rate.

632
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:03,580
Oh, really? This morning he ate
a bowl of waxed fruit.

633
00:43:03,665 --> 00:43:05,040
Wait a minute.

634
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,834
I need the naughty-and-nice list.

635
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:09,127
No.

636
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:11,588
It says I'm supposed to check it twice.

637
00:43:11,673 --> 00:43:14,424
- Santa already checked it.
- No, I didn't.

638
00:43:14,676 --> 00:43:18,011
- The real Santa.
- I am the real Santa!

639
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:20,055
- I'm sorry?
- I'm in charge here.

640
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:22,224
- What?
- I check the list twice.

641
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:24,142
That's the rule. I like the rules.

642
00:43:24,227 --> 00:43:27,104
- You know how I feel.
- You're misunderstanding.

643
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:30,440
No, I'm the rule-maker.
I like the rules. Santa likes rules.

644
00:43:30,525 --> 00:43:33,277
I've got a good idea.
How about we have some fun?

645
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:34,528
Huh?

646
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,697
- It's good to have fun.
- Right.

647
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:39,950
Santa, look over there.
See those elves?

648
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:42,619
Go ahead. Go play some tinsel football.

649
00:43:42,704 --> 00:43:44,037
Break!

650
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:49,042
- What's the object of tinsel football?
- Come on down.

651
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:52,713
If you don't have the ball, get it.

652
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:54,881
If you have the ball, run to the end zone.

653
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:03,015
Okay, I'll go get the football.

654
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:06,226
Ready, hike!

655
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:15,944
I've got the ball. What are you
gonna do? Who's gonna stop me?

656
00:44:16,029 --> 00:44:17,279
Come on!

657
00:44:17,405 --> 00:44:18,697
This is a lot of fun!

658
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:25,996
Oh, so sorry!

659
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:43,972
Come here! Stop!
Slow down when I'm talking to you!

660
00:44:44,307 --> 00:44:47,100
Come here, you! Come on.

661
00:44:51,898 --> 00:44:53,607
He's headed east
toward the main entrance!

662
00:45:01,866 --> 00:45:03,200
Hello, Charlie.

663
00:45:06,162 --> 00:45:07,913
Hello, Principal Newman.

664
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:10,707
Are Laura and Neil on their way?

665
00:45:10,792 --> 00:45:12,709
No, I volunteered to go solo.

666
00:45:13,002 --> 00:45:14,628
You look...

667
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:17,214
You've lost weight. Feeling all right?

668
00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:19,299
I was until I got this phone call.

669
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:30,185
Charlie, you promised
you weren't gonna do this again.

670
00:45:30,603 --> 00:45:33,188
What's the matter with you?
I'm gonna have to punish ya.

671
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:35,565
I'll ground him for two months.

672
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:38,193
- I thought you were on my side!
- I'll go one better.

673
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:40,278
- You're suspended.
- But, Dad!

674
00:45:40,363 --> 00:45:44,074
I'm as upset about this as you,
but isn't there a punishment

675
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:45,742
that doesn't mean
takin' him out of school?

676
00:45:45,827 --> 00:45:47,953
- What did you have in mind?
- We could...

677
00:45:50,498 --> 00:45:52,499
Community service?

678
00:45:53,376 --> 00:45:54,626
Hah.

679
00:45:54,836 --> 00:45:56,837
That's not a bad idea.

680
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:02,759
Okay, Charlie. I want you
to start by cleaning up this wall.

681
00:46:02,844 --> 00:46:05,387
I want everything off of there by tonight.

682
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:09,474
And then clean off every mark
off every locker in this hallway.

683
00:46:09,559 --> 00:46:12,102
- Every one?
- Do as she says, Charlie.

684
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:14,396
But I have homework, tests to study for.

685
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,983
Not my problem.
I have a detention group on Saturday.

686
00:46:18,067 --> 00:46:20,569
So we will all get together
at the rec center

687
00:46:20,653 --> 00:46:22,612
and scrape off graffiti at 8:00 a.m.

688
00:46:22,697 --> 00:46:24,781
- See you both there.
- You say both of us?

689
00:46:24,866 --> 00:46:28,285
No, I'm very busy.
I do a lot of other community service.

690
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:31,455
That's good. You just got
yourself elected parent rep.

691
00:46:31,539 --> 00:46:34,291
And, Charlie,
we'll talk about the suspension.

692
00:46:53,561 --> 00:46:57,314
Curtis, what is he doing
in the naughty-and-nice center?

693
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:02,652
- What's going on?
- I'm checking the naughty-nice list.

694
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:05,614
- I'm checking it twice.
- I already told you!

695
00:47:07,408 --> 00:47:09,034
It's been checked. Don't worry.

696
00:47:09,118 --> 00:47:13,330
I do worry. There's a lot of mistakes.
I'll give you a big fat for instance!

697
00:47:13,456 --> 00:47:16,541
In Denmark, there's a guy
named Sven Halstrom right here.

698
00:47:16,626 --> 00:47:20,587
He's a Dane. He was wiping
his nose on his sister's shirt.

699
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:24,799
Yuk! That's not very nice!
And yet, he's on the nice list.

700
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:28,303
We try to cut most children
slack this time of year.

701
00:47:28,471 --> 00:47:32,516
I don't understand that!
Kids are misbehaving everywhere.

702
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,143
They're running with scissors.
They're sticky.

703
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:37,938
"I'm not gonna stop this car!"
"No, we're not there yet!"

704
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:40,649
"Brush your teeth!"
"Pick up those clothes!"

705
00:47:40,733 --> 00:47:42,734
It goes on and on.

706
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:46,446
But they're just kids!
Everybody misbehaves some time.

707
00:47:46,531 --> 00:47:49,407
But according to The Santa Handbook,

708
00:47:49,784 --> 00:47:53,036
naughty kids get lumps of coal
in their stockings. Right?

709
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,497
We will make stockings.

710
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:59,834
In my opinion, they should all
get coal in their stockings.

711
00:47:59,919 --> 00:48:02,629
- Don't you?
- No! That's not how it works!

712
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:05,590
Get me the naughty-nice list.
Get me every list!

713
00:48:05,675 --> 00:48:08,301
Get me everything.

714
00:48:17,979 --> 00:48:20,272
Mr. O'Reilly, Mr. Leary.

715
00:48:20,815 --> 00:48:22,649
You in charge of the gangbangers?

716
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:24,734
They're students, actually, and yes.

717
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:27,028
Keep 'em away from the car. It's new.

718
00:48:27,113 --> 00:48:29,489
I don't need some delinquent
kids scratchin' it up.

719
00:48:29,657 --> 00:48:33,243
They're not delinquents.
And don't worry about your car.

720
00:48:33,411 --> 00:48:36,246
I'd worry about your legs
in those shorts.

721
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:38,373
I thought only swimmers
shaved their legs!

722
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:41,835
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

723
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:44,921
- Brought you coffee.
- Thank you.

724
00:48:45,673 --> 00:48:49,593
- So you have a nice-guy side.
- I'm a man of many sides.

725
00:48:49,802 --> 00:48:52,679
I'm a puzzle.
I'm a Rubik's Cube with pants.

726
00:48:52,847 --> 00:48:55,348
A laugh! Actual laugh.

727
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:58,143
- Dad, it doesn't come off.
- It's not supposed to come off.

728
00:48:58,436 --> 00:49:00,604
Hence, you've got to be careful
where you put it.

729
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:03,815
Hence, tagging is serious.
Hence, your presence here.

730
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:08,028
Don't say "hence" anymore, Dad.
It's really annoying.

731
00:49:10,531 --> 00:49:12,324
Nicely done!

732
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:15,744
How do you do it? I have trouble
with one. You have hundreds.

733
00:49:18,122 --> 00:49:20,248
- Hi.
- Hi.

734
00:49:21,042 --> 00:49:23,543
I was really good this year.

735
00:49:24,003 --> 00:49:27,547
Is that so? Are you absolutely
sure about that, Pamela?

736
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:30,842
I want a doll house
and a swimming pool.

737
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:32,594
A swimming pool?

738
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:34,888
I'm sorry. She insisted on talking to you.

739
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:37,057
- It's not a problem.
- Okay.

740
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:41,895
I'll tell you what. If you can
promise me you'll be good,

741
00:49:42,647 --> 00:49:45,023
I can guarantee
you'll have a great Christmas.

742
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:47,609
- Okay! Yeah!
- Come on.

743
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:57,160
Kids get so nutty this time of year.

744
00:49:57,995 --> 00:50:00,580
- Is she a neighbor?
- No.

745
00:50:00,665 --> 00:50:02,290
How did you know her name?

746
00:50:02,375 --> 00:50:04,918
The necklace, it said Pamela on it.

747
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:07,796
Oh. I guess I missed that.
I'm gonna go check on this group.

748
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:15,845
You cost me, Pamela.

749
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:21,893
I just couldn't sleep
thinking about all those rules.

750
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:24,688
Am I wrong? Am I right? Does it matter?

751
00:50:24,772 --> 00:50:27,440
Couldn't have been
the three gallons of cocoa I had!

752
00:50:27,775 --> 00:50:30,944
But you understand rules, don't you?
You're highly decorated.

753
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:34,197
And look at that face. There you go.

754
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:36,533
There's a face only a mom would like.

755
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:39,619
I don't have a mom,
so I wouldn't know about that.

756
00:50:39,829 --> 00:50:42,414
Now, it's time for the big event.

757
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:44,791
Guess what?

758
00:50:45,668 --> 00:50:47,961
Son, it's showtime!

759
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:50,755
You're in the spotlight.
Get bigger with it.

760
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:53,842
It's your big chance. I need a little help.

761
00:50:53,926 --> 00:50:57,053
I need a little muscle.
I need a little nudge.

762
00:50:57,138 --> 00:50:59,556
Let's call yourself the little nudge!

763
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:03,560
This won't hurt, except
for the electric shock through you.

764
00:51:03,644 --> 00:51:05,311
See ya on the other side!

765
00:51:27,877 --> 00:51:30,086
- Oh. Hi.
- Hi.

766
00:51:30,671 --> 00:51:33,173
It looks like you're going out.
Sorry. I should have called.

767
00:51:33,257 --> 00:51:35,091
No, it's okay. Come in.

768
00:51:35,176 --> 00:51:36,342
- You sure?
- Uh-huh.

769
00:51:42,475 --> 00:51:44,809
- Is there a problem?
- No, no. I just...

770
00:51:44,894 --> 00:51:46,644
I wondered if...

771
00:51:47,855 --> 00:51:49,689
If you would...

772
00:51:50,691 --> 00:51:53,026
Do you want to go get some noodles?

773
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:56,613
Or pie?

774
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:59,491
But I don't want to
keep you from your date, so...

775
00:51:59,575 --> 00:52:02,368
Oh, it's not a date.
It's the faculty Christmas party.

776
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:03,828
Oh.

777
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:07,165
Is that your idea of a night on the town?

778
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:08,458
Noodles and pie?

779
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:12,504
- Yes. What would be your idea?
- Pizza and a movie.

780
00:52:12,588 --> 00:52:14,297
- Thick or thin crust?
- Thin.

781
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:15,799
Good! Movie?

782
00:52:15,883 --> 00:52:18,968
Two for the Road.
Audrey Hepburn, Albert Finney.

783
00:52:19,053 --> 00:52:22,347
Movie's okay, but the car was the star.
'53 MG TD.

784
00:52:22,431 --> 00:52:24,766
Racing green, wire wheels. Beautiful.

785
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:28,144
I'm impressed. That is a great car.
My favorite car.

786
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:30,104
Didn't like driving 'em in the rain.

787
00:52:30,189 --> 00:52:33,358
You have to push it to start it.
Other than that, it's perfect.

788
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:35,485
It's perfect, though.

789
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:42,575
- I could drive you to your party.
- That would be great.

790
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:45,328
Except for, eventually,
I'm going to have to get home.

791
00:52:46,747 --> 00:52:48,748
Well, I could pick you up.

792
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:51,918
So you're going to drop me off,
then come back and pick me up?

793
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:54,963
- Yeah.
- Why don't you just stay?

794
00:52:55,381 --> 00:52:57,382
- All right, I'll stay.
- I'll get my coat.

795
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:00,885
So, Mr. Andretti, what are you driving?

796
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:03,263
You know, I think you're gonna like it.

797
00:53:35,713 --> 00:53:37,547
Mind if I ask you something personal?

798
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:38,631
Please.

799
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:41,259
- You look really different.
- The weight.

800
00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:45,930
It's Indian teas and
it's a lot of salves and stuff. It's...

801
00:53:46,015 --> 00:53:48,099
- Do you want some cocoa?
- Yes.

802
00:53:49,435 --> 00:53:51,477
Cocoa. You have thought of everything.

803
00:53:51,729 --> 00:53:54,898
Well, this time of year, I really shine.

804
00:53:55,316 --> 00:53:57,567
Yeah, I can't wait till it's over, though.

805
00:53:57,985 --> 00:53:59,903
Streets are crowded,
the malls are jammed,

806
00:53:59,987 --> 00:54:02,989
people max out their credit cards...
It's noisy.

807
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:04,532
When did you become such a cynic?

808
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:06,618
Oh.

809
00:54:06,827 --> 00:54:08,536
I don't know.

810
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:11,039
I used to love Christmas, too.

811
00:54:11,123 --> 00:54:14,584
It was the only day
that my parents didn't fight.

812
00:54:15,836 --> 00:54:17,337
- Oh.
- Oh.

813
00:54:18,047 --> 00:54:20,256
They were at each other all the time.

814
00:54:20,341 --> 00:54:24,218
But on Christmas,
they tried to make the holiday special.

815
00:54:24,303 --> 00:54:27,805
My dad went through this charade
so I'd believe in Santa Claus.

816
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:31,434
He put a cot by the fireplace
so Santa could take a nap...

817
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:33,186
Like he has time to take a nap!

818
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:37,607
Consider the amount of gifts
he would have to deliver.

819
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:40,068
Why would he nap?
He would probably need some coffee.

820
00:54:40,152 --> 00:54:43,863
Yeah. And there was cocoa
and cookies.

821
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:47,075
And carrots for the reindeer.

822
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:49,661
That's a good gesture.
The reindeer love carrots.

823
00:54:49,745 --> 00:54:51,955
And the thought
is important to them, too.

824
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:57,001
Yeah. And I'd wake up, and the cocoa
and cookies would be gone,

825
00:54:57,086 --> 00:54:59,629
and the cot would be mussed
and the carrots gnawed.

826
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:04,425
They swallow them.
If they're fresh, they'll eat 'em like that.

827
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:06,302
They love red bell peppers, too.

828
00:55:06,387 --> 00:55:08,471
You know the stories. If you read...

829
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:14,227
And there would be incredible presents
under the tree.

830
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:18,064
One year was a rocking horse,
and I named it Harvey.

831
00:55:18,774 --> 00:55:21,234
And the next year
was a little red wagon,

832
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:24,320
which I made a lemonade stand,
which was great.

833
00:55:24,405 --> 00:55:26,906
And the last year was...

834
00:55:26,991 --> 00:55:31,077
It was just a Baby Doll.
She was pink and soft and beautiful.

835
00:55:33,372 --> 00:55:35,665
- Beautiful?
- Yes.

836
00:55:37,793 --> 00:55:40,837
I believed in Santa so much
I'd get in fights at school

837
00:55:40,921 --> 00:55:43,339
with kids who tried to tell me
that he didn't exist.

838
00:55:43,424 --> 00:55:45,591
And one day,
I came home with a bloody nose.

839
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:49,721
That's when my parents
decided to tell me to

840
00:55:49,805 --> 00:55:51,597
grow up.

841
00:55:51,682 --> 00:55:53,725
I was devastated.

842
00:55:55,728 --> 00:55:58,980
Good, Carol! This is great
sleigh-riding conversation!

843
00:55:59,064 --> 00:56:01,190
- I'm a terrible sleigh-riding...
- It's fine conversation.

844
00:56:03,027 --> 00:56:05,695
A person just wants something
to believe in, you know?

845
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:09,115
Yes, I know. Yes, I know.

846
00:56:10,659 --> 00:56:12,660
Okay, we have cocoa.

847
00:56:12,745 --> 00:56:15,371
We have a blanket.
We have a horse-drawn sleigh.

848
00:56:15,456 --> 00:56:17,290
The only thing that's...

849
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:21,586
What?

850
00:56:21,837 --> 00:56:23,296
- It's snowing.
- Oh.

851
00:56:23,964 --> 00:56:25,048
As if by magic.

852
00:56:25,132 --> 00:56:28,134
That's what I was gonna say,
that it should be snowing!

853
00:56:33,307 --> 00:56:39,479
It's been a blue

854
00:56:40,606 --> 00:56:43,483
Holiday

855
00:56:45,319 --> 00:56:49,197
Since you've been gone

856
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:55,036
Oh, my darling

857
00:56:55,996 --> 00:56:58,331
Won't you

858
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:03,127
Hurry, hurry home

859
00:57:03,212 --> 00:57:08,716
It's been a blue

860
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:12,553
Holiday

861
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:14,305
I owe you one.

862
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:17,517
It's a great party.

863
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:20,520
Look. That guy moved.

864
00:57:22,231 --> 00:57:24,273
- Would you excuse me?
- Mmm-hmm.

865
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:45,253
Could I have your attention?
Your attention, please!

866
00:57:46,213 --> 00:57:50,925
There we go. Hi. I'm Scott Calvin
and I just thought I'd step up here and...

867
00:57:51,218 --> 00:57:55,388
And say the word that
we've all been longing to hear.

868
00:57:55,973 --> 00:57:57,640
Fire!

869
00:58:01,228 --> 00:58:04,605
Okay. What I think, folks,
is that a lot of you have forgotten

870
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:07,233
what the true spirit
of Christmas is all about.

871
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:11,320
If you're not willing
to dance or laugh or flirt

872
00:58:11,405 --> 00:58:14,657
or risk the buffet,
I don't think we have much choice.

873
00:58:15,284 --> 00:58:18,661
So before the choir gets out here,
I say we rock this house

874
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:20,788
- with a secret Santa! Huh?
- Oh.

875
00:58:22,249 --> 00:58:24,250
Carol, happy, happy Christmas!

876
00:58:24,376 --> 00:58:26,752
I think they're just decorations
for the carolers.

877
00:58:26,837 --> 00:58:28,045
Ah.

878
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:30,965
She's afraid these are decorations
for the caroling.

879
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:33,843
I think Carol is right about the caroling!

880
00:58:34,094 --> 00:58:37,763
I'm talking about the packages that
are backstage.

881
00:58:38,098 --> 00:58:39,932
There aren't any packages backstage.

882
00:58:40,017 --> 00:58:41,726
Oh, there's none back there.

883
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:45,897
So I was mistaken
when I saw this bag of gifts.

884
00:58:45,981 --> 00:58:48,316
Maybe I'm wrong, but it sure
looks like a bag of gifts.

885
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:51,611
Oh, it's heavy like a bag of gifts.

886
00:58:52,321 --> 00:58:54,947
Look at this! What's in here?

887
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,161
It's very heavy, very heavy.

888
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,664
John Pierce.

889
00:59:04,291 --> 00:59:06,292
Doesn't your mom call you JJ?

890
00:59:08,837 --> 00:59:10,004
Merry Christmas, JJ.

891
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:22,516
No way.

892
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:26,062
This is Toss Across!

893
00:59:26,146 --> 00:59:28,356
I used to love this when I was a kid!

894
00:59:29,149 --> 00:59:31,150
But I never told anybody.

895
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:33,819
Where did... Who did this?

896
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:37,323
Grace Kim.

897
00:59:39,326 --> 00:59:41,285
Yes, there you are! Merry Christmas.

898
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:42,787
- Thank you.
- Tom Astle.

899
00:59:42,871 --> 00:59:44,997
- Me! Sorry, Gordon.
- Hey!

900
00:59:45,082 --> 00:59:47,541
- Haven't changed a bit!
- Gee, thanks.

901
00:59:47,918 --> 00:59:49,710
- Lizzy Garcia.
- Here.

902
00:59:50,087 --> 00:59:53,506
- There. Merry Christmas.
- Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots!

903
00:59:53,757 --> 00:59:56,092
Mint condition! This is incredible!

904
00:59:56,176 --> 00:59:58,344
The Holly Hobbie Oven!

905
01:00:02,516 --> 01:00:04,183
Come on up
and get the rest of your presents.

906
01:00:05,978 --> 01:00:07,687
- Marie?
- Here!

907
01:00:07,771 --> 01:00:11,023
There she is. Katie. Jerry.

908
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:13,484
- Here!
- Cory. Cory?

909
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:15,027
Here!

910
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:46,851
Oh!

911
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:58,237
- Carl, you need a net.
- Not me!

912
01:00:59,531 --> 01:01:01,532
This is great.

913
01:01:04,244 --> 01:01:06,037
Hey, party animal, you want to play?

914
01:01:06,121 --> 01:01:08,998
- I can't figure it out.
- It's beanbag tic-tac-toe.

915
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:11,334
No, I mean the secret Santa thing.

916
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:14,378
Someone tracked down
all those wonderful antique toys.

917
01:01:14,463 --> 01:01:16,839
Probably someone who knows
his way around eBay.

918
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:18,341
- Yeah.
- Yep.

919
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:21,385
It was you. I know it was you.

920
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:23,554
I just can't figure out...
How did you do it?

921
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:26,932
Sometimes you don't need
to know all the answers.

922
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:29,185
Speaking of which...

923
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:32,063
Even the principal
needs a Christmas gift.

924
01:01:32,147 --> 01:01:33,606
Merry Christmas.

925
01:01:34,232 --> 01:01:36,108
Come on, open it. Rip it open.

926
01:01:36,193 --> 01:01:38,569
Come on.
We're not gonna save the paper.

927
01:02:02,344 --> 01:02:04,261
It's Baby Doll.

928
01:02:10,811 --> 01:02:11,977
Come here.

929
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:16,065
- Did you call the office?
- No.

930
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:18,109
- Did they call you?
- It's not like that.

931
01:02:18,193 --> 01:02:20,903
- Did you investigate us?
- No, I wouldn't do that.

932
01:02:21,238 --> 01:02:24,865
Did you... I told you about
Baby Doll an hour ago and...

933
01:02:25,367 --> 01:02:27,243
Did you send someone to...

934
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:29,078
- No.
- No.

935
01:02:29,371 --> 01:02:32,873
Well... I don't know how you did it.

936
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:35,835
It's like some kind of magic.

937
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:38,963
Yeah, sort of like some kind of magic.

938
01:02:39,047 --> 01:02:43,092
And pretty much the last that I have.

939
01:02:43,343 --> 01:02:46,387
What? Well, what... You know what?

940
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:49,849
I don't want to know.

941
01:02:50,142 --> 01:02:53,853
What you did in there tonight
for everyone was wonderful.

942
01:02:53,979 --> 01:02:55,146
Thank you.

943
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:02,361
I'm sorry.

944
01:03:03,572 --> 01:03:05,489
I shouldn't have done that.

945
01:03:08,201 --> 01:03:09,702
- Is that okay?
- Yeah.

946
01:03:12,414 --> 01:03:15,374
Got this weird feeling
in the pit of my stomach.

947
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:18,502
I'm...

948
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:22,882
I'm not real good at this.

949
01:03:41,985 --> 01:03:43,569
Where did that come from?

950
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:45,321
I don't know.

951
01:03:58,752 --> 01:04:00,753
Hi! Merry Christmas!

952
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:03,047
Ho, ho, ho!

953
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:11,138
Can I have your attention?

954
01:04:12,474 --> 01:04:15,309
Stop the work, please.
Everybody, stop the work.

955
01:04:15,435 --> 01:04:17,269
Merry Christmas!

956
01:04:17,646 --> 01:04:20,231
That's nice. I have a little
announcement to make.

957
01:04:21,441 --> 01:04:23,734
From this moment forward,
we're not gonna make any more toys.

958
01:04:25,946 --> 01:04:28,447
The children of the world
don't deserve presents.

959
01:04:28,532 --> 01:04:30,699
They're running rampant
with naughtiness.

960
01:04:30,784 --> 01:04:33,786
This Christmas, we're gonna
give those greedy kids

961
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:36,789
exactly what they deserve.

962
01:04:37,457 --> 01:04:42,753
A beautiful, high-quality
yet low-sulfur variety of coal!

963
01:04:45,924 --> 01:04:47,132
Quiet!

964
01:04:48,802 --> 01:04:52,513
We have to focus,
all of us, on the goals ahead.

965
01:04:53,473 --> 01:04:56,100
And just to make sure
that that happens...

966
01:04:56,977 --> 01:04:58,519
Thank you, sweetie.

967
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:03,440
I hate to blow my own horn.

968
01:05:16,204 --> 01:05:18,163
Stay where you are! Don't be afraid!

969
01:05:23,086 --> 01:05:24,503
Back! Back!

970
01:05:24,838 --> 01:05:27,756
I was up late, couldn't sleep.

971
01:05:27,841 --> 01:05:29,967
Milk wouldn't do it,
cocoa is a little sweet,

972
01:05:30,051 --> 01:05:33,012
so I decided to make
an army of toy soldiers.

973
01:05:34,681 --> 01:05:37,433
They don't have a good sense
of humor like me.

974
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:44,440
I would do what they ask you.
Which is what I'm going to tell you!

975
01:05:44,524 --> 01:05:47,610
Don't listen to him!
This guy's not Santa!

976
01:05:48,028 --> 01:05:50,029
- He's not Santa?
- He's a toy!

977
01:05:50,822 --> 01:05:54,116
He has a rubber face
and a plastic tushy!

978
01:05:57,495 --> 01:06:00,789
Trust me! Don't let him ruin Christmas!

979
01:06:00,874 --> 01:06:03,459
Thank you
for those kind words, Bernard!

980
01:06:03,668 --> 01:06:06,754
Well, now that we all
have an understanding,

981
01:06:07,881 --> 01:06:11,592
have a joyous and merry Christmas!

982
01:06:15,889 --> 01:06:17,931
Merry Christmas!

983
01:06:25,732 --> 01:06:27,483
Okay, ready? Go!

984
01:06:27,942 --> 01:06:30,152
This is what I call community service!

985
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:31,945
Here she comes. Duck down!

986
01:06:34,074 --> 01:06:35,282
Hey!

987
01:06:35,367 --> 01:06:37,826
Attention you hooligans
behind that snowbank!

988
01:06:37,911 --> 01:06:39,912
You have snowballed the wrong house.

989
01:06:40,372 --> 01:06:44,333
Drop the snowballs,
kick them away from the snowsuits

990
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:46,251
and keep the mittens
where I can see them.

991
01:06:46,628 --> 01:06:49,171
Your dad is hanging
with Principal Newman?

992
01:06:49,255 --> 01:06:51,298
- Is he dating her?
- No.

993
01:06:51,883 --> 01:06:54,927
Go to your homes.
Pelt the ones you love.

994
01:06:55,470 --> 01:06:57,429
And a merry Christmas!

995
01:06:58,515 --> 01:07:01,266
- That is really gross, man.
- Shut up.

996
01:07:14,781 --> 01:07:17,908
There are things about me
you should know. Personal things.

997
01:07:17,992 --> 01:07:19,702
We don't need to rush things, Scott.

998
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,413
I think you need to know these things.

999
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:24,415
Okay.

1000
01:07:28,545 --> 01:07:32,381
Remember the mistletoe,
how it just showed up?

1001
01:07:32,465 --> 01:07:34,133
- Yes.
- And the sleigh.

1002
01:07:34,217 --> 01:07:36,510
- How magical that was?
- Yes.

1003
01:07:36,803 --> 01:07:38,595
Secret Santa Claus?

1004
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:40,681
- That was me.
- Yeah?

1005
01:07:43,935 --> 01:07:47,563
I'm not this size much.
I'm usually much bigger than this.

1006
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:49,356
So am I sometimes.

1007
01:07:49,441 --> 01:07:51,775
I have a big white beard that's beautiful.

1008
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:54,528
- I don't.
- I work a long way from home.

1009
01:07:54,612 --> 01:07:56,905
When I get back home,
I sleep for a long time.

1010
01:07:56,990 --> 01:07:59,950
See? Okay. It's not so bad so far.

1011
01:08:00,034 --> 01:08:02,578
You work far away from home
and you sleep a lot.

1012
01:08:02,662 --> 01:08:06,081
You've never been to prison
and you don't wear socks with sandals.

1013
01:08:06,166 --> 01:08:07,332
Well...

1014
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:11,170
I'm Santa Claus.

1015
01:08:11,963 --> 01:08:12,963
What?

1016
01:08:14,007 --> 01:08:17,634
The suit, the red suit's real.
The North Pole is a place.

1017
01:08:18,011 --> 01:08:22,473
There are elves. They make toys.
They're beautiful and it's real.

1018
01:08:22,557 --> 01:08:24,391
- I exist.
- That's not funny.

1019
01:08:24,476 --> 01:08:25,976
- It's magical.
- Cut it out.

1020
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:27,102
I'm telling the truth.

1021
01:08:27,187 --> 01:08:29,521
I told you something personal
from my childhood

1022
01:08:29,606 --> 01:08:33,859
and now you're making a joke
out of it and it's not funny. It hurts.

1023
01:08:34,068 --> 01:08:38,864
I know how hard this is to believe,
but connect the dots.

1024
01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:41,950
- Think what's happened.
- I know what's going on.

1025
01:08:42,035 --> 01:08:44,828
- Think about the little girl.
- You felt something for me.

1026
01:08:44,913 --> 01:08:47,998
Now you're acting like a mental patient
because you're scared.

1027
01:08:48,082 --> 01:08:51,919
- I deliver gifts in a sleigh.
- Incredible.

1028
01:08:52,003 --> 01:08:55,506
I go down chimneys with burning logs
and I still deliver gifts.

1029
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:57,758
I'm not scared. That's not what this is.

1030
01:08:57,842 --> 01:08:59,134
If you're trying to push me away,
it's working.

1031
01:08:59,219 --> 01:09:01,762
Carol, don't make me leave.

1032
01:09:02,472 --> 01:09:03,889
Please.

1033
01:09:33,545 --> 01:09:35,504
- How could you pick her?
- I didn't.

1034
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:36,922
You don't care anymore.

1035
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:39,341
I care more about you than anybody.

1036
01:09:39,425 --> 01:09:40,467
But it's a two-way street.

1037
01:09:40,552 --> 01:09:43,887
- You won't confide in me.
- You want it? Here it is.

1038
01:09:45,431 --> 01:09:47,975
- What? Talk to me.
- I don't live a normal life.

1039
01:09:48,059 --> 01:09:50,435
- You live a great life here.
- Just listen to me!

1040
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:53,522
My friends get to go around
saying, "My dad's a plumber."

1041
01:09:53,606 --> 01:09:56,900
"My dad's a pilot." "My dad's a dentist."
You know what?

1042
01:09:56,985 --> 01:10:00,529
My dad is the best thing of all
and I can't tell anyone.

1043
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:06,118
You have no idea how hard it is,
walking around with that secret.

1044
01:10:06,578 --> 01:10:09,705
And now you're going out
with Principal Newman!

1045
01:10:09,789 --> 01:10:12,165
And you don't even tell me about it.

1046
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:14,835
My whole life has become
about secrets, and I hate it!

1047
01:10:19,883 --> 01:10:21,174
I'm sorry.

1048
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:26,179
Forget about
Principal Newman, all right?

1049
01:10:26,806 --> 01:10:28,557
And forget about Santa. I'm done.

1050
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:32,978
My time's up.

1051
01:10:33,396 --> 01:10:34,980
Who cares anymore?

1052
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:44,031
- Hi, Charlie.
- Hi, Lucy.

1053
01:10:44,115 --> 01:10:46,491
- What are you doing?
- Just shoveling.

1054
01:10:46,659 --> 01:10:47,826
Oh.

1055
01:10:48,036 --> 01:10:50,537
Charlie, is Uncle Scott Santa Claus?

1056
01:10:51,539 --> 01:10:53,415
No. Why would you think that?

1057
01:10:53,499 --> 01:10:55,000
I don't know.

1058
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:59,504
- How come Uncle Scott was sad?
- What makes you think that?

1059
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:03,467
I asked him to stick a straw in his nose
and blow bubbles in his milk.

1060
01:11:03,635 --> 01:11:06,511
- And he said no.
- Whatever.

1061
01:11:07,055 --> 01:11:09,890
- Can you talk to him?
- I don't think so, Lucy.

1062
01:11:10,058 --> 01:11:12,100
- Did you have a fight?
- Sort of.

1063
01:11:12,185 --> 01:11:14,102
- Are you gonna make up?
- I don't know!

1064
01:11:14,187 --> 01:11:16,188
- Are you gonna be mad forever?
- Lucy!

1065
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:18,523
- What?
- These are hard questions.

1066
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:20,400
No, they're not. They're easy.

1067
01:11:20,485 --> 01:11:23,070
And you can't be mad
at him forever, Charlie.

1068
01:11:23,154 --> 01:11:25,072
He's your daddy and you love him.

1069
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:37,084
Dashing through the snow

1070
01:11:37,168 --> 01:11:39,544
In a strip-mining machine

1071
01:11:39,629 --> 01:11:41,505
Flatten the hills we go

1072
01:11:41,589 --> 01:11:43,131
Come on!

1073
01:11:43,216 --> 01:11:46,051
Put a smile on that face, little troll!

1074
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:48,345
Wait a minute. I got a joke.
This'll cheer you up.

1075
01:11:50,098 --> 01:11:52,099
- Knock, knock!
- Who's there?

1076
01:11:53,935 --> 01:11:55,978
- Aren't you?
- Aren't you who?

1077
01:11:56,062 --> 01:11:58,021
Aren't you supposed to
get back to work?

1078
01:11:58,106 --> 01:12:01,316
All of ya! You little idiots! Back to work!

1079
01:12:02,485 --> 01:12:04,069
Got any twos?

1080
01:12:05,071 --> 01:12:06,279
Hmm.

1081
01:12:07,699 --> 01:12:09,116
Go fish.

1082
01:12:11,703 --> 01:12:14,413
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1083
01:12:14,497 --> 01:12:17,290
Whoa!

1084
01:12:18,918 --> 01:12:20,919
- What was that?
- I don't know.

1085
01:12:22,964 --> 01:12:25,298
- Want some more hot chocolate?
- Mmm-hmm.

1086
01:12:25,383 --> 01:12:26,717
Okay.

1087
01:12:28,928 --> 01:12:31,096
- Would you get that, honey?
- Yeah, sure.

1088
01:12:34,892 --> 01:12:37,102
Is Scott here?

1089
01:12:37,437 --> 01:12:38,437
Who are you?

1090
01:12:39,522 --> 01:12:42,024
Curtis, a friend from Buffalo.

1091
01:12:43,401 --> 01:12:45,861
- Are you an elf?
- Of course not!

1092
01:12:45,945 --> 01:12:47,988
Why would you ask
such a silly question?

1093
01:12:48,614 --> 01:12:50,282
How come you have pointy ears?

1094
01:12:51,242 --> 01:12:55,328
It's because I never ate
my green vegetables.

1095
01:12:56,330 --> 01:12:58,373
Do you eat your green vegetables?

1096
01:13:01,794 --> 01:13:04,046
Uncle Scott!

1097
01:13:04,338 --> 01:13:06,840
Yeah, I'm right here. What's wrong?

1098
01:13:07,341 --> 01:13:09,634
Oh! Curtis! What are you doin' here?

1099
01:13:09,844 --> 01:13:12,304
There's a little trouble at the plant.

1100
01:13:13,973 --> 01:13:16,224
It's okay. Curtis is a very old friend.

1101
01:13:16,309 --> 01:13:19,061
We have a large firm.
We work together in...

1102
01:13:19,145 --> 01:13:20,812
- Buffalo.
- Buffalo?

1103
01:13:22,690 --> 01:13:26,359
We work together in Buffalo.
So, we're gonna talk business.

1104
01:13:26,486 --> 01:13:29,446
- What business?
- It's none of your business.

1105
01:13:29,655 --> 01:13:32,324
Soon, I'm gonna be seven.
And then I can know things.

1106
01:13:32,825 --> 01:13:34,701
- Good night, Curtis.
- Good night, Lucy.

1107
01:13:34,786 --> 01:13:36,328
Good night, Lucy.

1108
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:40,082
- What's up?
- Toy Santa's out of control.

1109
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:42,084
He's locked up the elves,
shut down the workshop,

1110
01:13:42,168 --> 01:13:45,587
he thinks everybody's naughty
and he's gonna give everyone coal!

1111
01:13:45,713 --> 01:13:48,465
- Why didn't Bernard tell me?
- He's under house arrest.

1112
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:49,674
Bernard?

1113
01:13:50,009 --> 01:13:52,928
Fly back with me to the North Pole
to save Christmas!

1114
01:13:53,012 --> 01:13:55,222
I can't. I have no magic left.
I'm out of magic. Look.

1115
01:13:57,934 --> 01:14:00,852
- I thought you had Comet.
- Yeah, we...

1116
01:14:03,147 --> 01:14:05,190
Yes! Come on!

1117
01:14:05,858 --> 01:14:07,859
Hey, Comet. We just...

1118
01:14:10,988 --> 01:14:15,075
Comet?

1119
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:19,121
Look at me.

1120
01:14:20,081 --> 01:14:21,456
Comet.

1121
01:14:23,543 --> 01:14:25,210
What are ya doin'?

1122
01:14:25,795 --> 01:14:27,879
Eating sugar is bad for you.

1123
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:31,758
What do you mean, you didn't eat this?

1124
01:14:33,845 --> 01:14:35,137
Who did?

1125
01:14:36,222 --> 01:14:37,389
A squirrel?

1126
01:14:39,559 --> 01:14:42,435
Get this. You gotta fly both
of us back to the North Pole.

1127
01:14:43,813 --> 01:14:45,522
Yeah, tonight.

1128
01:14:46,899 --> 01:14:48,650
Okay. I'll help you up.

1129
01:14:48,901 --> 01:14:51,570
All right? Ready?
You've got to help me a little here.

1130
01:14:53,364 --> 01:14:54,906
Pull.

1131
01:14:57,076 --> 01:14:59,661
Good. Okay, we almost got it.

1132
01:15:00,121 --> 01:15:01,663
That's okay.

1133
01:15:02,832 --> 01:15:06,626
Okay, now, help me.
Can ya move anything?

1134
01:15:14,427 --> 01:15:16,052
Fire in the hole! Get away!

1135
01:15:20,933 --> 01:15:22,267
Whoa!

1136
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:24,269
Eat some roughage, will you?

1137
01:15:25,563 --> 01:15:29,900
- Oh. What about the jet pack?
- It burned up on reentry.

1138
01:15:32,486 --> 01:15:35,655
What am I supposed to do?
Grow wings?

1139
01:15:38,993 --> 01:15:41,494
I hope he doesn't have
too many stops to make tonight.

1140
01:15:43,831 --> 01:15:47,709
You and me both, pal.
Okay. Let's just get it over with.

1141
01:15:48,628 --> 01:15:49,794
Okay.

1142
01:15:50,296 --> 01:15:52,589
One, two,

1143
01:15:53,966 --> 01:15:55,133
three!

1144
01:15:57,970 --> 01:16:01,014
- What's going on down there?
- Are you sure about this?

1145
01:16:01,307 --> 01:16:03,225
What? The old toaster trick?

1146
01:16:03,309 --> 01:16:06,478
When we were kids, we used to do
this to get a little extra cash.

1147
01:16:06,896 --> 01:16:09,314
- Works every time!
- I can't watch this.

1148
01:16:10,107 --> 01:16:13,360
- You ready, buddy?
- All right. Let her rip.

1149
01:16:13,486 --> 01:16:14,778
One,

1150
01:16:14,862 --> 01:16:15,862
two,

1151
01:16:16,697 --> 01:16:17,697
three!

1152
01:16:19,158 --> 01:16:20,408
Ow!

1153
01:16:23,913 --> 01:16:25,330
Oh, Scott!

1154
01:16:26,749 --> 01:16:29,584
- Scott, are you all right?
- Mom!

1155
01:16:30,294 --> 01:16:32,462
- Yes?
- I lost another tooth.

1156
01:16:32,713 --> 01:16:34,547
Should I put it under my pillow?

1157
01:16:34,966 --> 01:16:36,341
Yes!

1158
01:17:06,872 --> 01:17:08,373
By cuspids!

1159
01:17:09,834 --> 01:17:11,418
This way. Come on.

1160
01:17:11,502 --> 01:17:14,296
Curtis, get the door.
It's a Tooth Fairy ambush.

1161
01:17:19,969 --> 01:17:22,721
What do you people want?
I only carry $20 in change.

1162
01:17:22,805 --> 01:17:25,348
Tooth Fairy, it's me, Santa.

1163
01:17:25,558 --> 01:17:27,600
I've lost the weight
and the beard, but it's me.

1164
01:17:27,685 --> 01:17:30,687
I know Santa. Santa is a friend.
And you, sir, are no Santa.

1165
01:17:30,771 --> 01:17:31,980
I am too.

1166
01:17:32,064 --> 01:17:35,233
How did I know I could capture you
by holdin' on to a wing?

1167
01:17:36,027 --> 01:17:39,029
You wanted to change your name
to Captain Floss or Plaque Man.

1168
01:17:39,113 --> 01:17:40,822
Or, as I recall, Roy.

1169
01:17:40,906 --> 01:17:43,033
And it was Santa's idea
to call you the Molarnator.

1170
01:17:46,203 --> 01:17:48,830
- Who's the kid?
- One of my elves. He's an elf.

1171
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:50,582
Ow.

1172
01:17:51,584 --> 01:17:52,709
Santa!

1173
01:17:55,755 --> 01:17:57,797
The Molarnator at your service!

1174
01:17:58,758 --> 01:18:01,676
- A little altitude, please!
- What?

1175
01:18:01,761 --> 01:18:05,138
Could you possibly fly
a little higher? Ow!

1176
01:18:05,598 --> 01:18:07,015
- What?
- Ow!

1177
01:18:07,099 --> 01:18:08,433
Never mind!

1178
01:18:17,526 --> 01:18:19,110
Principal Newman?

1179
01:18:20,279 --> 01:18:21,863
What is it, Charlie?

1180
01:18:23,115 --> 01:18:25,909
You keep asking me
if there's something bothering me.

1181
01:18:26,786 --> 01:18:28,787
Well, there is. I...

1182
01:18:29,663 --> 01:18:31,873
I couldn't talk about it before, but...

1183
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:34,793
I want to talk about it now.

1184
01:18:36,128 --> 01:18:38,380
Okay. Go ahead.

1185
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:42,008
- My dad is Santa.
- Oh, please. Not you too.

1186
01:18:42,093 --> 01:18:43,551
Hold on.

1187
01:18:44,136 --> 01:18:46,513
If you have no feelings
for my dad, then fine.

1188
01:18:47,264 --> 01:18:49,641
But if the only reason
for not being with him is

1189
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:52,811
that you don't believe in him,
you're making a big mistake.

1190
01:18:53,145 --> 01:18:54,562
Oh, Charlie.

1191
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:56,272
Here.

1192
01:18:58,984 --> 01:19:01,986
I want you to take this.
Look into this and

1193
01:19:02,363 --> 01:19:04,948
try to remember what it was like
when you were little

1194
01:19:05,282 --> 01:19:06,950
and you still believed in Christmas.

1195
01:19:32,518 --> 01:19:35,520
Seeing isn't believing.
Believing is seeing.

1196
01:19:38,107 --> 01:19:40,191
You haven't seen anything yet!

1197
01:19:44,363 --> 01:19:45,738
- Curtis?
- What?

1198
01:19:45,823 --> 01:19:46,823
Ow!

1199
01:19:46,907 --> 01:19:48,199
- What do I do?
- Slow down.

1200
01:19:48,284 --> 01:19:49,451
Okay.

1201
01:19:49,535 --> 01:19:51,494
Piece of cake. Attaboy. There you go.

1202
01:19:52,079 --> 01:19:53,955
Why can't you fly higher?

1203
01:19:54,582 --> 01:19:57,542
Tooth Fairy, I want to thank you.
I'll never forget this.

1204
01:19:58,127 --> 01:19:59,794
I wish I could do more, but I gotta go.

1205
01:19:59,879 --> 01:20:02,088
Denver just started
a new peewee hockey league.

1206
01:20:02,173 --> 01:20:04,466
Before you go,
I want you to know that nobody,

1207
01:20:04,550 --> 01:20:06,676
nobody was braver
than you were today.

1208
01:20:07,428 --> 01:20:08,553
You should be proud of your wings.

1209
01:20:10,055 --> 01:20:12,098
- They're not too girly?
- Not on you.

1210
01:20:21,734 --> 01:20:24,194
Wouldn't it be easier
to go through the workshop?

1211
01:20:24,278 --> 01:20:26,863
No. That way Santa and
his soldiers would be expecting us.

1212
01:20:26,947 --> 01:20:31,159
Sound military strategy involves
taking your enemy by surprise.

1213
01:20:31,243 --> 01:20:32,785
It's good strategy.

1214
01:20:35,247 --> 01:20:38,249
Sometimes being a despot
is a tough business.

1215
01:20:40,169 --> 01:20:41,252
Come on.

1216
01:20:46,759 --> 01:20:48,760
It's Scott, isn't it?

1217
01:20:49,220 --> 01:20:51,179
Yeah. What are you supposed to be?

1218
01:20:51,263 --> 01:20:54,599
A better, stronger version
of what you used to be,

1219
01:20:55,434 --> 01:20:57,477
with a flawless complexion, I might add.

1220
01:20:57,561 --> 01:21:01,064
- Look, it just glistens.
- Listen to me. I'm back now.

1221
01:21:01,148 --> 01:21:04,192
So untie us. Let the elves go
and give me back the coat.

1222
01:21:09,573 --> 01:21:13,159
No can do! It's Christmas Eve!
I have coal to deliver!

1223
01:21:13,244 --> 01:21:15,954
And I don't want
those naughty kids to suffer!

1224
01:21:16,121 --> 01:21:18,998
Boys! One, two, three!

1225
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:23,795
And one, two! Try to keep up!
Let's go. Move it on!

1226
01:21:24,755 --> 01:21:27,632
Try to... This is just too tight.

1227
01:21:29,093 --> 01:21:30,885
This is all my fault.

1228
01:21:30,970 --> 01:21:33,304
I thought I could create another Santa.

1229
01:21:33,806 --> 01:21:36,474
My elfin pride blinded me to all reason.

1230
01:21:38,227 --> 01:21:40,228
There's only one Santa.

1231
01:21:40,563 --> 01:21:42,480
Well, I've done a pretty rotten job.

1232
01:21:42,648 --> 01:21:44,440
I didn't check the list twice.

1233
01:21:44,817 --> 01:21:47,318
My kid thinks I betrayed him.

1234
01:21:48,487 --> 01:21:50,196
I hurt the woman I love.

1235
01:21:51,407 --> 01:21:53,408
I ruined Christmas.

1236
01:22:02,793 --> 01:22:04,085
Charlie!

1237
01:22:04,169 --> 01:22:06,170
How'd you get up here?

1238
01:22:12,177 --> 01:22:13,219
Scott!

1239
01:22:13,304 --> 01:22:15,346
I got to fly in with the Tooth Fairy.

1240
01:22:16,098 --> 01:22:17,640
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1241
01:22:18,309 --> 01:22:21,269
Brush between meals
and don't forget the floss.

1242
01:22:21,353 --> 01:22:23,730
And if anybody cares, I'm exhausted.

1243
01:22:24,565 --> 01:22:27,692
And she has a beautiful smile.

1244
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:31,279
- Thank you for everything.
- No. Thank you.

1245
01:22:32,448 --> 01:22:35,033
I am...
The Molarnator!

1246
01:22:39,330 --> 01:22:40,371
Whoo!

1247
01:22:40,873 --> 01:22:42,332
Come on!

1248
01:22:58,223 --> 01:22:59,515
Hyah!

1249
01:23:14,573 --> 01:23:16,115
Get out of the way!

1250
01:23:16,909 --> 01:23:18,159
What are you doing?

1251
01:23:18,243 --> 01:23:21,079
- You gotta save Christmas.
- How am I supposed to save...

1252
01:23:25,292 --> 01:23:27,168
- No, no, no.
- Please. Don't worry.

1253
01:23:28,379 --> 01:23:31,506
Whoa! Whoa!

1254
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:33,424
Slow down.

1255
01:23:34,510 --> 01:23:35,968
Stay.

1256
01:23:37,930 --> 01:23:39,180
Oh!

1257
01:23:41,308 --> 01:23:42,767
Oh, Chet...

1258
01:23:43,602 --> 01:23:46,270
Ouch! Ow! Oh, oh, oh!

1259
01:23:47,815 --> 01:23:49,816
Thanks. Excuse me, pork chop.

1260
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:52,985
Okay. Chet, this is it.
You ready to rock and roll?

1261
01:23:53,987 --> 01:23:56,114
- Chet?
- Yeah. He's still in training.

1262
01:23:56,782 --> 01:23:59,701
- Has he had much flight time?
- About a minute and a half.

1263
01:24:00,536 --> 01:24:03,204
- He's had a lot of crash time!
- Curtis!

1264
01:24:03,622 --> 01:24:06,207
- He's just a baby.
- All right.

1265
01:24:06,959 --> 01:24:08,543
Let's see what this baby can do.

1266
01:24:08,919 --> 01:24:10,878
Oh, boy.

1267
01:24:10,963 --> 01:24:13,548
Ready to go, buddy?
You know what we gotta do.

1268
01:24:14,258 --> 01:24:15,675
Hyah!

1269
01:24:18,512 --> 01:24:23,558
Chet! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Chet, Chet.

1270
01:24:24,852 --> 01:24:26,811
You gotta focus, Chet.

1271
01:24:29,606 --> 01:24:33,151
Okay, everybody! Outside, now!

1272
01:24:37,114 --> 01:24:39,615
Almost there, boys. Let's go!

1273
01:24:42,995 --> 01:24:44,787
Chet, whoa!

1274
01:25:01,263 --> 01:25:03,264
Snowballs, on three!

1275
01:25:03,599 --> 01:25:04,599
One!

1276
01:25:07,060 --> 01:25:08,311
Two!

1277
01:25:14,818 --> 01:25:15,818
Three!

1278
01:25:33,712 --> 01:25:35,254
Okay, elves!

1279
01:25:37,007 --> 01:25:38,633
Let's get 'em!

1280
01:25:45,557 --> 01:25:47,266
Not so far!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1281
01:25:47,351 --> 01:25:48,726
- Chet!
- Whoo!

1282
01:25:49,228 --> 01:25:51,646
Back for more action, eh, Scooter?

1283
01:25:51,814 --> 01:25:52,980
Chet, Chet!

1284
01:25:56,401 --> 01:25:58,277
Cut the chitchat, Chet!

1285
01:25:58,362 --> 01:26:00,488
Why is this such a problem? Come on!

1286
01:26:00,572 --> 01:26:02,490
Where do you think you're going?

1287
01:26:02,574 --> 01:26:05,409
- Go, go!
- Hyah, boy! Come on!

1288
01:26:06,745 --> 01:26:07,787
Faster!

1289
01:26:09,289 --> 01:26:11,916
The lead. The one in the front, Chet!

1290
01:26:12,251 --> 01:26:14,418
Leave my reindeer alone!

1291
01:26:14,837 --> 01:26:16,587
Go! Go! Go!

1292
01:26:17,589 --> 01:26:20,049
Come on! We got to get them
before they get out the hole.

1293
01:26:20,759 --> 01:26:22,760
Stay away from my lead reindeer!

1294
01:26:24,471 --> 01:26:26,764
Whoo!

1295
01:26:27,182 --> 01:26:29,433
Holy Hannah, he's an action hero!

1296
01:26:29,768 --> 01:26:31,602
Hyah!

1297
01:26:53,458 --> 01:26:58,170
What are you doin' up there?
I can't see where I'm driving.

1298
01:27:00,591 --> 01:27:02,884
You are a sad, strange little man.

1299
01:27:04,219 --> 01:27:05,386
Whoa.

1300
01:27:06,263 --> 01:27:08,514
You're gonna fall, I hope!

1301
01:27:10,726 --> 01:27:13,227
That's a good way to lose an eye!

1302
01:27:15,689 --> 01:27:18,107
Look out! You're scaring me!

1303
01:27:25,115 --> 01:27:26,490
Can I help you?

1304
01:27:26,909 --> 01:27:29,243
Honey, I'm home!

1305
01:27:34,291 --> 01:27:36,000
Loser!

1306
01:28:29,346 --> 01:28:32,515
Hey, I'm supposed to wear this coat!
How about a little elbow?

1307
01:28:32,599 --> 01:28:35,685
There you are. That's gotta feel good.

1308
01:28:36,061 --> 01:28:39,230
You want the shoe?
Take it off. Go ahead. Go on!

1309
01:28:45,153 --> 01:28:46,362
Huh?

1310
01:28:47,155 --> 01:28:49,782
What are we gonna do now,
smarty-pants?

1311
01:28:51,827 --> 01:28:54,036
Watch out! The building! Left, left!

1312
01:28:54,121 --> 01:28:56,664
Oh, well. The town'll break the fall.

1313
01:29:02,546 --> 01:29:04,088
Look out!

1314
01:29:05,716 --> 01:29:08,926
Yo, Tony! Hey, Brian, stop me!

1315
01:29:16,810 --> 01:29:20,062
Get off of me! Now remember,
rules are very, very important!

1316
01:29:20,147 --> 01:29:21,939
I want hot chocolate.

1317
01:29:22,357 --> 01:29:25,609
Hey, guys, back up.
I've got a special place for him.

1318
01:29:27,738 --> 01:29:30,072
You idiot! Wait a minute,
something's shocking me.

1319
01:29:30,157 --> 01:29:32,324
- You were great.
- Sounds like you were, too.

1320
01:29:32,409 --> 01:29:34,452
- We've got 10 minutes.
- Where is Carol?

1321
01:29:35,245 --> 01:29:37,038
- Carol! Are you all right?
- Yes!

1322
01:29:37,122 --> 01:29:40,958
- Where are you going?
- I gotta deliver gifts.

1323
01:29:41,043 --> 01:29:42,501
Aren't you forgetting something?

1324
01:29:42,586 --> 01:29:44,503
- No.
- You gotta get married.

1325
01:29:44,963 --> 01:29:46,213
Excuse me?

1326
01:29:49,634 --> 01:29:51,052
Carol, I...

1327
01:29:52,637 --> 01:29:57,850
I cannot continue being Santa
unless I find a Mrs. Claus.

1328
01:29:59,144 --> 01:30:00,186
Oh.

1329
01:30:00,270 --> 01:30:03,022
So that's what the whole
noodles and pie thing...

1330
01:30:03,106 --> 01:30:05,775
- You just needed a wife.
- No.

1331
01:30:06,109 --> 01:30:07,359
No?

1332
01:30:08,278 --> 01:30:09,945
- Yes.
- Yes?

1333
01:30:10,989 --> 01:30:12,948
Yes, I was looking for a wife.

1334
01:30:13,492 --> 01:30:17,036
No, I didn't figure on falling in love.

1335
01:30:21,208 --> 01:30:22,666
You love me?

1336
01:30:25,504 --> 01:30:29,548
- This is all happening so fast.
- Well, there's no pressure.

1337
01:30:30,550 --> 01:30:31,759
Good.

1338
01:30:31,843 --> 01:30:34,345
I mean, if I don't get married,
I just won't deliver the gifts,

1339
01:30:36,348 --> 01:30:38,516
and children everywhere
will stop believing,

1340
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:42,353
the elves will lose their jobs,
the North Pole will disappear

1341
01:30:42,437 --> 01:30:44,438
and Christmas will be gone.

1342
01:30:47,609 --> 01:30:49,944
- Get down on one knee.
- Hmm?

1343
01:30:50,028 --> 01:30:51,987
Do it. Now.

1344
01:30:55,992 --> 01:30:57,618
Say "Carol."

1345
01:31:00,831 --> 01:31:02,581
- Carol.
- Uh-huh.

1346
01:31:03,041 --> 01:31:04,208
Yeah?

1347
01:31:04,334 --> 01:31:10,673
You say this is happening all so fast.

1348
01:31:11,007 --> 01:31:17,179
But you've known me your whole life.

1349
01:31:17,264 --> 01:31:20,307
When you were little and alone...

1350
01:31:20,392 --> 01:31:23,269
- Santa...
- I can take it from here.

1351
01:31:23,353 --> 01:31:25,354
Santa was always there for you.

1352
01:31:25,438 --> 01:31:28,691
And I will be, as long as you
continue to believe in me.

1353
01:31:29,568 --> 01:31:31,777
I know I'm asking you
to leave everything at home,

1354
01:31:32,154 --> 01:31:34,572
but I can guarantee you
that this is worth it.

1355
01:31:35,115 --> 01:31:36,782
This place...

1356
01:31:37,492 --> 01:31:40,327
This place is all about magic

1357
01:31:40,412 --> 01:31:42,913
and love and wonder.

1358
01:31:44,416 --> 01:31:46,792
And occasionally a thin-crust pizza

1359
01:31:47,335 --> 01:31:49,879
and a movie and a long winter night.

1360
01:31:50,755 --> 01:31:52,756
Is there a school here?

1361
01:31:55,635 --> 01:31:59,471
Yeah, we have one, a school,
but the elves need a new principal.

1362
01:31:59,598 --> 01:32:03,392
'Cause as of late, some of the elves
have been acting a bit impish.

1363
01:32:10,108 --> 01:32:11,692
Carol,

1364
01:32:13,695 --> 01:32:15,696
- I love you.
- You do?

1365
01:32:16,781 --> 01:32:19,116
Would you be my wife?

1366
01:32:21,119 --> 01:32:22,578
I will.

1367
01:32:22,662 --> 01:32:25,080
Thank you.
I've got it from here.

1368
01:32:30,629 --> 01:32:32,296
I will.

1369
01:32:37,552 --> 01:32:40,679
By the powers vested in me by me,

1370
01:32:41,973 --> 01:32:43,641
I now pronounce you Santa

1371
01:32:44,893 --> 01:32:46,268
and Mrs. Claus.

1372
01:32:49,606 --> 01:32:52,066
Well, go on now. Kiss her!

1373
01:32:59,783 --> 01:33:02,534
Aw!

1374
01:33:24,349 --> 01:33:27,351
- Dad, we gotta go.
- Walk me to my sleigh.

1375
01:33:27,644 --> 01:33:31,313
We gotta go! When we get back,
we start making some more toys.

1376
01:33:36,945 --> 01:33:41,323
All right. Well, Mrs. Claus,
you might want to get some rest.

1377
01:33:41,408 --> 01:33:44,618
You see, tomorrow begins
vacation season for me,

1378
01:33:44,703 --> 01:33:47,079
which means a three-month
honeymoon for us.

1379
01:33:50,083 --> 01:33:53,460
Nothing tropical.
You do not want to see this in a Speedo.

1380
01:33:55,380 --> 01:33:56,547
Don't be home too late.

1381
01:33:58,216 --> 01:34:00,009
And so it begins.

1382
01:34:00,302 --> 01:34:02,136
Boys, we've got some toys to deliver!

1383
01:34:02,262 --> 01:34:03,929
Hyah! Hyah!

1384
01:34:26,578 --> 01:34:28,203
Lucy?

1385
01:34:28,872 --> 01:34:30,497
What, Charlie?

1386
01:34:31,416 --> 01:34:34,251
Come downstairs.
I want you to see something.

1387
01:34:44,262 --> 01:34:45,929
Lucy.

1388
01:34:46,556 --> 01:34:48,515
Watch this.

1389
01:35:04,783 --> 01:35:06,492
Uncle Scott?

1390
01:35:10,497 --> 01:35:13,415
- Do you have any twos?
- Go fish!

1391
01:35:13,500 --> 01:35:17,544
You are Santa!
I knew it was you all along.

1392
01:35:17,796 --> 01:35:20,422
- And you were right.
- Uncle Scott,

1393
01:35:21,132 --> 01:35:24,259
you look all rosy.
Are you feeling better?

1394
01:35:24,511 --> 01:35:26,512
I'm feeling much, much better.

1395
01:35:27,013 --> 01:35:29,139
Is there anything else
I should know about?

1396
01:35:29,808 --> 01:35:33,394
I don't know. But Charlie has
something he wants to tell you.

1397
01:35:33,603 --> 01:35:34,937
Okay.

1398
01:35:36,439 --> 01:35:40,651
You know, I was exactly your age
when I found out my dad was Santa.

1399
01:35:41,319 --> 01:35:44,863
- But I couldn't tell anybody.
- I can't tell anybody either?

1400
01:35:44,948 --> 01:35:47,825
No. But knowing it isn't a burden.

1401
01:35:49,327 --> 01:35:50,577
It's a gift.

1402
01:35:52,038 --> 01:35:54,748
Most kids stop believing in Santa
when they grow up.

1403
01:35:55,250 --> 01:35:57,084
But I get to believe in him forever.

1404
01:35:57,961 --> 01:36:00,587
I love you, Charlie. Thank you.

1405
01:36:06,886 --> 01:36:08,095
But do we still get toys?

1406
01:36:08,721 --> 01:36:11,682
If you ever get to bed
and go to sleep like the other kids.

1407
01:36:13,017 --> 01:36:14,017
Okay.

1408
01:36:14,853 --> 01:36:18,188
- Merry Christmas, Lucy.
- Merry Christmas, Santa.

1409
01:36:19,357 --> 01:36:21,400
Sport, I gotta fly.

1410
01:36:37,333 --> 01:36:39,710
Easy, boys, easy.

1411
01:36:40,962 --> 01:36:42,296
You're gettin' it, Chet.

1412
01:36:56,060 --> 01:36:58,061
Look, Charlie!

1413
01:36:59,022 --> 01:37:00,981
Merry Christmas, Comet!

1414
01:37:07,572 --> 01:37:09,156
All right, boys!

1415
01:37:09,908 --> 01:37:12,326
Hyah! Ho, ho, ho!

1416
01:37:13,119 --> 01:37:15,370
Hyah!

1417
01:37:15,455 --> 01:37:19,082
Merry Christmas to all!
And to all a good night!

1418
01:37:21,044 --> 01:37:23,253
Nothin' wrong with a straight line, Chet.

1419
01:37:23,338 --> 01:37:26,256
Chet! Chet!

1420
01:37:52,450 --> 01:37:55,327
Everybody loves Christmas

1421
01:37:55,411 --> 01:37:57,955
Everybody has fun

1422
01:37:58,998 --> 01:38:02,084
That time ofthe year
That holiday cheer

1423
01:38:02,168 --> 01:38:04,127
A good time for everyone

1424
01:38:04,212 --> 01:38:06,755
Everybody loves Christmas

1425
01:38:07,131 --> 01:38:09,466
Oh, count the ways

1426
01:38:10,677 --> 01:38:13,178
You know it's almost here

1427
01:38:13,263 --> 01:38:15,264
Oh, Christmas Day

1428
01:38:16,474 --> 01:38:18,475
Christmas Day

1429
01:38:25,817 --> 01:38:27,317
Hey!

1430
01:38:28,570 --> 01:38:30,696
What the heck are we doin' out here?

1431
01:38:33,449 --> 01:38:36,410
Look, if we're gonna dance,

1432
01:38:37,412 --> 01:38:40,747
dance like this. All of us!

1433
01:38:41,708 --> 01:38:43,709
Everybody, you idiots!

1434
01:38:45,295 --> 01:38:46,837
Hey, lady!

1435
01:38:47,213 --> 01:38:48,505
Watch this!

1436
01:38:49,007 --> 01:38:51,008
Ever seen a toy do this?

1437
01:38:53,219 --> 01:38:56,471
Where you going? Whoo!
