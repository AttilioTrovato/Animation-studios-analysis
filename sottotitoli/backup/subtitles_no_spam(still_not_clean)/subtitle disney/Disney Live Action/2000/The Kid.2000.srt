ring mine first, please?

There's someone
ahead of you, sir.

my little change bear, but--
- That's almost interesting.

- I'm an image consultant, okay?
- Okay.

So you sort of

Right.

Hey, look,

I'm flying to L.A. to start
an anchor job in the local news,

and I do not think that it's an accident
that I'm sitting next to you.

So the cosmic purpose of our meeting
is for me to give you free advice.

- Quiet as the dead.

Your hair's too big,
your brows are too dark,
your nails are too long...

00:04:25,712 --> 00:04:27,534
and your foundation's
too orange.

00:04:27,632 --> 00:04:30,948
Your perfume's too sweet.
It's the news, honey, not the prom.

- When you're on assignment,
take them out.
- What about my accent?

55

I'm always being warned
to stop saying ''y'all.''

Don't ever stop saying ''y'all.''
Your ''y'all'' is your trademark.

Say ''y'all,'' and you'll be
promoted in six months.

And why are you
wearing a yellow tie?

Janet, how could you know
I'm wearing my yellow tie?
You can't even see me.

77
00:06:19,758 --> 00:06:21,700
I can hear the stress
in your voice.

78
00:06:21,805 --> 00:06:23,628
Whenever you're stressed,
you wear the yellow tie,

79
00:06:23,725 --> 00:06:26,475
which makes you feel
all-powerful, so you're
probably gonna yell at me,

80

which I'm not in the mood for,
so don't.

- Nice tie.
- I am not stressed.

There is nothing wrong
with me.

sleep last night. Can I
have today's work, please?

You're with a human now.

There's an eight on
your desk to sign.

standing in your office.

in my office, Janet?

with a machete.

for a check.

is gonna have to do.

highly important people
are clamoring for you.

1164
01:13:03,075 --> 01:13:05,890
There is something else.

1165
01:13:05,987 --> 01:13:10,809
I want you to find out
why the full moon looks orange
sometimes when it rises.

1166
01:13:10,915 --> 01:13:15,105
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks, Janet. Goodnight.

1167
01:13:31,779 --> 01:13:34,943
Hey, kid. Rusty.

1168
01:13:37,187 --> 01:13:40,864
- Hi.
- Hi.

1169
01:13:42,562 --> 01:13:44,984
Wanna help me
with something?

1170
01:13:45,090 --> 01:13:48,025
- I think it might
get you back to your time.
- Sure.

1171
01:13:48,130 --> 01:13:50,552
Good.

1172
01:13:52,322 --> 01:13:54,940
Anything about me?

1173
01:13:55,042 --> 01:13:57,725
Yeah. Anything
that'll take me back.

1174
01:13:57,826 --> 01:13:59,735
Hmm.

1175
01:13:59,842 --> 01:14:02,329
You know how I like
to find caterpillars...

1176
01:14:02,434 --> 01:14:05,052
and put them in jars
and feed 'em...

1177
01:14:05,154 --> 01:14:08,001
and watch 'em
make cocoons?

1178
01:14:11,650 --> 01:14:13,537
No.

1179
01:14:13,634 --> 01:14:15,522
And then one day,

1180
01:14:15,618 --> 01:14:18,039
they break out
and it's really cool.

1181
01:14:20,418 --> 01:14:22,589
No. Not a clue.

1182
01:14:22,689 --> 01:14:24,991
But keep going.
Tell me some more stuff.

1183
01:14:25,090 --> 01:14:27,807
Remember last summer
at Josie's birthday party...

1184
01:14:27,906 --> 01:14:30,491
when I got Parmesan cheese
stuck up my nose?

1185
01:14:32,801 --> 01:14:34,711
[Rusty]
Got any sixes?

1186
01:14:34,817 --> 01:14:36,705
Nope. Go fish.

1187
01:14:36,801 --> 01:14:38,874
Any fours?

1188
01:14:38,977 --> 01:14:41,083
Negative. Go fish.

1189
01:14:44,546 --> 01:14:46,368
Got any sevens?

1190
01:14:48,737 --> 01:14:50,810
Tell me some more
about Dad.

1191
01:14:52,609 --> 01:14:54,496
Sometimes...

1192
01:14:54,593 --> 01:14:56,568
he lets me help him
work on the car.

1193
01:14:56,673 --> 01:14:58,615
If I do something wrong...

1194
01:14:58,721 --> 01:15:00,630
he yells at me.

1195
01:15:02,401 --> 01:15:04,921
Sometimes he buys me
ice cream afterwards.

1196
01:15:05,025 --> 01:15:07,992
But still,
I don't like messing up.

1197
01:15:08,097 --> 01:15:10,399
Like last week...

1198
01:15:10,497 --> 01:15:12,537
I lost a screw.

1199
01:15:12,641 --> 01:15:15,096
I was afraid to tell him.

1200
01:15:16,865 --> 01:15:19,450
I found it later on
in my pocket.

1201
01:15:19,553 --> 01:15:22,008
Look, I still have it.

1202
01:15:26,912 --> 01:15:29,334
I'm afraid
to give it back to him.

1203
01:15:31,104 --> 01:15:32,926
Got any nines?

1204
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:38,967
No.

1205
01:15:39,073 --> 01:15:42,073
My homeroom teacher last year
was fat Mrs. Kinkel man.

1206
01:15:42,176 --> 01:15:44,859
She was so much better
than Mr. Lupus.

1207
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:47,229
He had that purple bump
on his face.

1208
01:15:47,328 --> 01:15:49,467
I don't remember the bump guy.
What grade was that?

1209
01:15:49,568 --> 01:15:51,456
How come you're asking me
all this stuff?

1210
01:15:51,553 --> 01:15:53,691
'Cause I'm
forgetting something.

1211
01:15:53,792 --> 01:15:56,126
I'm forgetting this one event
that meant something to me...

1212
01:15:56,224 --> 01:15:59,093
and if I can remember that one thing,
maybe I can get you home.

1213
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:01,567
Are you sure it's not
the purple bump?

1214
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:04,184
- It's not the bump, kid.
- It was a pretty big bump.

1215
01:16:04,287 --> 01:16:06,197
- Tell me more about second grade.
- Why?

1216
01:16:06,304 --> 01:16:08,192
Nobody had a bump
in second grade.

1217
01:16:10,528 --> 01:16:13,528
[ Rusty]
My best friend was Tim Wheaton,
until a few months ago.

1218
01:16:13,632 --> 01:16:15,519
Remember him?

1219
01:16:15,615 --> 01:16:17,503
[ Russ ]
No, I don't.

1220
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:20,469
- His house smells like fish sticks.
- No.

1221
01:16:20,575 --> 01:16:24,318
Well, he was my best friend
until he started
hanging out with Vince...

1222
01:16:24,415 --> 01:16:26,936
and these other creepy guys.

1223
01:16:27,039 --> 01:16:30,301
He threw a rock at me
and we haven't been friends since then.

1224
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:33,563
- He threw a rock at us?
- Oh, yeah.

1225
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:36,052
- Why? What happened?
- Oh, those guys get together...

1226
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:38,615
every recess in the corner
of the playground yard...

1227
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:40,607
where they like
to pick on kids.

1228
01:16:42,176 --> 01:16:44,063
Back behind the kindergarten.

1229
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:47,420
Yeah. Where the yard monitor
can't see you!

1230
01:16:47,519 --> 01:16:49,886
- Where that big sliding board is?
- Yeah, the really huge one!

1231
01:16:49,983 --> 01:16:51,870
- You remember it!
- Go on. Don't stop.

1232
01:16:51,967 --> 01:16:54,837
There's four of them,
and if they don't like you...

1233
01:16:54,943 --> 01:16:57,212
they make
your life a nightmare!

1234
01:17:03,966 --> 01:17:07,512
And the worst thing
about them is they're
really mean to animals.

1235
01:17:07,615 --> 01:17:09,753
Especially this one
three-legged dog.

1236
01:17:09,855 --> 01:17:11,797
[Barking]

1237
01:17:11,902 --> 01:17:13,812
Tripod!

1238
01:17:13,918 --> 01:17:16,252
Tripod!
The dog's name is Tripod!

1239
01:17:16,350 --> 01:17:19,416
I know the dog's name!
I know everything, kid.

1240
01:17:19,518 --> 01:17:21,427
I know why you're here!
This is the event!

1241
01:17:21,535 --> 01:17:23,575
Vince Kajinski, the fight!
The fight!

1242
01:17:23,678 --> 01:17:27,475
It was my eighth birthday.
It was 32 years ago.

1243
01:17:27,582 --> 01:17:29,971
Today! Ha, Ha, Ha!

1244
01:17:36,702 --> 01:17:39,287
Holy smokes.

1245
01:17:41,310 --> 01:17:43,448
Look at the car!

1246
01:17:45,118 --> 01:17:47,322
Look at your clothes!

1247
01:17:49,758 --> 01:17:52,179
[ Whispering ]
Holy smokes.

1248
01:17:53,310 --> 01:17:55,765
- Holy smokes!
- Holy smokes!

1249
01:17:55,870 --> 01:17:59,863
- We did it, kid!
- Am I home! Is it really 1 968?

1250
01:18:04,637 --> 01:18:06,939
No doubt about it, kid.
What time's recess?

1251
01:18:07,038 --> 01:18:09,820
- 1 0:30.
- Hang on, kid.

1252
01:18:09,917 --> 01:18:12,089
We've got 1 5 minutes
to change our life.

1253
01:18:12,189 --> 01:18:14,906
Okay, now listen.
This is gonna happen real fast,

1254
01:18:15,005 --> 01:18:17,558
so you gotta remember
what Kenny told you, all right:
one, two, one, two.

1255
01:18:17,662 --> 01:18:20,444
- One, two--
- Keep your head down, keep swingin'.

1256
01:18:20,605 --> 01:18:23,026
[Bell Ringing]

1257
01:18:29,950 --> 01:18:33,692
Look, look, look!
There's the really big slide, remember?

1258
01:18:35,325 --> 01:18:38,074
[Russ]
It used to be a lot bigger.

1259
01:18:38,173 --> 01:18:40,083
Here's what I remember:

1260
01:18:40,189 --> 01:18:44,444
Some really bad guys
tie up that three-legged dog, Tripod.

1261
01:18:44,541 --> 01:18:46,428
When you try to stop them,
you get really thrashed.

1262
01:18:46,524 --> 01:18:49,394
Oh, no.
Do I save him?

1263
01:18:49,501 --> 01:18:51,541
No. You go down
after only one punch,

1264
01:18:51,645 --> 01:18:53,587
thereby solidifying
your reputation as a loser...

1265
01:18:53,693 --> 01:18:55,635
for the next eight years,
all the way through high school...

1266
01:18:55,741 --> 01:18:58,359
and ruining our life
from that moment on.

1267
01:18:58,460 --> 01:19:00,795
Oh, holy smokes.

1268
01:19:00,892 --> 01:19:04,537
Any second now, Vince Kajinski
and his cohorts are gonna
come around that corner.

1269
01:19:05,628 --> 01:19:09,403
- Look. There they are.
- Hey, boo!

1270
01:19:09,501 --> 01:19:12,021
They're gonna say something to you
to get you to come over there.

1271
01:19:12,125 --> 01:19:15,288
Once you get back there,
they have Tripod tied up.

1272
01:19:15,388 --> 01:19:17,777
Any questions?

1273
01:19:17,884 --> 01:19:20,306
Yeah. What's a cohort?

1274
01:19:21,564 --> 01:19:23,452
Hey, Rusty,
come over here.

1275
01:19:23,548 --> 01:19:26,810
It's your birthday, right?
We got a present for you.

1276
01:19:26,908 --> 01:19:30,356
Look, kid. You don't have
to do this at all.

1277
01:19:30,460 --> 01:19:32,282
You don't have
to fight today.

1278
01:19:32,380 --> 01:19:34,289
[Kid]
Come on, hurry up!

1279
01:19:37,659 --> 01:19:40,889
No. If I don't
go against them today,

1280
01:19:40,988 --> 01:19:43,770
I'll have to fight tomorrow
or the next day,

1281
01:19:43,868 --> 01:19:46,323
and today,
you're here with me.

1282
01:19:46,428 --> 01:19:49,777
That's right.
I'm here with you today.

1283
01:19:51,644 --> 01:19:53,531
I can do this.

1284

You can do it.
Don't be afraid.

Come on, man, it'll be great.
Why don't you go?

- Yeah.
- It'll be fun.
There's your present.

- This stinkin', three-legged

- Dirt bags!

Yes! You won.

- Holy smokes! You did it!
- Yabba-dabba-doo!

- I did it, I did it!

be different now.

- What?
