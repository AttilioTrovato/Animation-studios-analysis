1
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:40,319
Aah!

2
00:03:56,936 --> 00:03:58,426
It's love, isn't it?

3
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:00,062
Sometimes you walk into a house

4
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:03,040
and you take one look around,
and you know.

5
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:04,576
And you say, "This is for me."

6
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:06,544
Oh, I think it's perfect.

7
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:09,946
It's just what
we've been looking for.

8
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:11,608
There aren't enough plugs.

9
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:13,015
Hey, wait, Mr. Coleman, now.

10
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,179
That place I showed you
on Sycamore Street

11
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,587
was absolutely,
positively loaded with plugs.

12
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:19,591
That's right.
There were plenty.

13
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:21,024
But the steps were too high.

14
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,584
When we get older,
we could trip.

15
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:25,961
Every house we look at
you find something to pick at.

16
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:27,659
I just know what I like.

17
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:30,168
Would you like a divorce?
'Cause I'll bring it.

18
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:32,830
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
No need for that.

19
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:35,169
I'm gonna find
this house for you.

20
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:37,641
I am committed to finding
the perfect house for you.

21
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,041
I don't care how long it takes.

22
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,977
Because at Evers & Evers,

23
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:44,983
we want you to be happy
forevers and evers.

24
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:47,952
Oh, excuse me one second.
Let me take this call.

25
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,579
Sorry.
I'm so sorry.

26
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:51,385
Hello. Evers & Evers
Real Estate. Jim Evers.

27
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:55,359
Hey, honey. How's it going?
Do they like the house?

28
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:57,328
Yes, this house is
still available.

29
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:58,557
Oh, I knew it.

30
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,064
I told you they were
lookie-Ious.

31
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,964
It's another interested party.

32
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:04,560
Listen, I'm on my way home
to get ready for dinner.

33
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,070
I'm looking forward to tonight.

34
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,629
Well, are you preapproved?

35
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:10,699
Yeah, the reservation's at 7:00,
so don't be late.

36
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:12,506
Okay.
Well, 7:00 is perfect.

37
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:15,570
Let's get together at 7:00,
and we'll go over your offer.

38
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,138
Okay, honey.
I'll see you later.

39
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:18,148
See what you did?

40
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:20,447
We love the house.

41
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,250
We do.
We love it.

42
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,517
Well, then, Mrs. Coleman.

43
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,921
Taking that into consideration,

44
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,517
there's only one thing
left to do.

45
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:31,394
Let's sign some papers.

46
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:34,622
- Hey.
- Hey.

47
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:35,963
Lorraine and Gary.

48
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:37,798
Just like I promised,
here's the offer.

49
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,565
Signed, sealed, and delivered.

50
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,869
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

51
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:43,408
We are so grateful.

52
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:46,104
This is a cause for celebration.
Let us buy you a drink.

53
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,511
Oh, no, really, I can't.
My wife's waiting for me.

54
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:51,049
This is such a big deal for us.
We have to celebrate.

55
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:52,948
- I really can't. I'm late.
- We insist.

56
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,613
Please.

57
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,849
Okay. One quick drink.
Okay. One quick one.

58
00:05:57,924 --> 00:05:59,915
Sir, can I have a ginger ale
over here, please?

59
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:01,721
Oh, no.
That's not a drink.

60
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:03,227
Sammy, three Volcanoes.

61
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:05,730
- Oh, no. No volcanoes.
- They're incredibly smooth.

62
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:06,822
Oh, we love it here.

63
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:08,366
We've been coming here
for years.

64
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:09,833
- It's like Hawaii.
- Yes.

65
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:11,233
We spent our honeymoon there.

66
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:12,965
It was fantastic.
Have you been?

67
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,597
- No, never been there.
- Promise me you'll go.

68
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:15,641
Promise.

69
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,575
I'll go if you sign.
I will go to Hawaii if you sign.

70
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:21,442
But I got to get going because
it's my anniversary tonight.

71
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:24,483
Your anniversary?
Happy anniversary!

72
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,110
Thank you.
Sign that thing here.

73
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:28,710
Happy anniversary

74
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:31,052
Happy anniversary,
happy anniversary

75
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:32,250
Happy anniversary

76
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:33,656
Happy, happy, happy, happy

77
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,160
Hey, sign this!

78
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,662
Okay, Jim.

79
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,891
- Sorry about that.
- No.

80
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,894
It's been a pleasure
doing business with you. Aloha.

81
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,733
Okay.
Bye-bye.

82
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,506
Oh, excuse me.
Did I hear you correctly?

83
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:49,905
Did you just sell their house?

84
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:51,136
I sure did.

85
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,405
'Cause we're looking to buy.

86
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:59,844
Honey, forgive me.

87
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:03,312
Well, I'm Jim Evers
of Evers & Evers Real Estate.

88
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:04,981
Tell me about your dream house.

89
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:08,993
Hi, Sara.
My name's Teddy.

90
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:10,995
Your husband told me to tell you
he loves you very much,

91
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:13,463
but sometimes he loses track
of the time.

92
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,296
I'm sorry I'm late.

93
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:17,427
Happy anniversary.

94
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,095
Happy anniversary.

95
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:21,333
Yes.

96
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,467
Look at what he brought you.

97
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:26,307
Look at that.
Isn't that pretty?

98
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,347
Oh, you know, you have
a wonderful husband

99
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:30,609
that thinks about you like that
on your anniversaries.

100
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:31,775
You're so fortunate!

101
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:33,716
It's beautiful.

102
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:37,322
It's actually Teddy's fault
that I'm late.

103
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,324
He had a little accident
in the backseat,

104
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:42,122
cotton all over the place,
but I cleaned it up.

105
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:44,891
It's okay.
I forgive Teddy.

106
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,864
Hey, come on, Sara.
Don't be like that.

107
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:50,061
I'm on a roll here.
We sold seven houses this month.

108
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,603
What about
the three soccer games,

109
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:54,435
two birthday parties,
and barbecue you missed?

110
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:56,873
Did I miss that much stuff
this month?

111
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:00,077
Okay. We're gonna take off
this weekend.

112
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:00,908
What?

113
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,039
We're gonna take off
and go down to the lake

114
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:06,050
like we did last year with
the kids for the whole weekend.

115
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:08,313
- How's that sound?
- Can we really close on this?

116
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:10,287
Yes. How about this?
We can close on this.

117
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:11,846
How about this?

118
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,392
Close on that.
Let me go tell the kids.

119
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,223
All right?
Okay. All right.

120
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:18,889
Megan and Michael,
big family adventure!

121
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:20,990
Hey!
Michael Jordan Evers!

122
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:22,295
Aah! Aah!

123
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:23,926
Hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

124
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,437
- Dad! There's a...
- What is it?

125
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,303
- There's a spider in my room!
- There's a what?

126
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:30,205
There's a spider in my room
on the window.

127
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:32,210
Why don't you kill it, man?

128
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:34,212
That's a big spider!

129
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,872
Come on.
It's just a spider, Michael.

130
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:37,882
How big could it be?
What is this?

131
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,009
Where's the spider at?

132
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:42,111
What? Man, you're acting
like it's Mothra.

133
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,246
It's just a spider.

134
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:45,722
You're making a big deal
out of nothing, Michael.

135
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:46,815
You're 10 years old.

136
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:49,225
It's time I teach you how to
kill a spider the right way.

137
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:51,923
The most efficient way
to crush a spider.

138
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:54,398
You got to get a good magazine.
Doesn't matter what you use.

139
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:58,267
Some people like to use "Life"
or "Time" or...

140
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:02,132
This is my "Sports Illustrated"
Swimsuit Edition.

141
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,199
What are you doing with it?

142
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:06,472
- I don't know.
- Yeah, right.

143
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,707
If you can look at this,
you should have enough courage

144
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:10,305
to kill a spider the right way.

145
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,011
So I'm gonna roll this up
so you get a good grip on it.

146
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:15,451
You get a bead on the spider.
You get a side swing.

147
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:17,489
That's where you can really get
some good action going.

148
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,185
You want to come across like
that so you really crush it.

149
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:23,092
You come across this way so
you get his whole escape route

150
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:24,220
in case he try to go...

151
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:25,855
You take it, and you whack it.

152
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:27,627
Go on.
Whack the spider.

153
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,133
I don't want to whack it.

154
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:31,465
Come on, you got to whack
the spider, Mike. Whack it.

155
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:34,370
Dad, I'm afraid of spiders.
I can't whack it.

156
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,339
Let me explain something to you.

157
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,868
All your life you're gonna be
facing spiders, okay?

158
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:41,811
I am?

159
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:45,373
What I'm trying to say is
you should never be afraid.

160
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:47,146
People know,
they use that against you.

161
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:49,153
I'm not scared of anything.
I'm your dad, right?

162
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:51,018
You're my son.
You whack that spider.

163
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,523
I can't whack the spider, Dad.

164
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,026
Come on. Whack it.
You can do it. Whack the spider.

165
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,688
- I don't want to whack it.
- Yes, you can. Come on.

166
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,424
Kill the spider.
Kill the spider.

167
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:01,659
Dad, I can't crush it.
I can't whack it!

168
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,027
Hey.

169
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,468
There.
Happy?

170
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:07,096
No, I'm not happy, Megan.

171
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:08,470
I was trying to make a point

172
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,169
about how it's important
to whack your own spiders!

173
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:13,108
Whatever.

174
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:14,475
Mm-hmm.

175
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:17,038
Past the Old Miller Road.

176
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,174
Okay. Great.

177
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,946
It is an old home, Ms. Evers.

178
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:24,353
And my employer is anxious
to move on.

179
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:27,517
Would it be possible
for you to come alone

180
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:29,356
to discuss the situation?

181
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:31,225
But my husband and I work
as a team.

182
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:34,630
The master usually
does not take visitors.

183
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,793
However, from your photograph,

184
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:39,861
he thought you to have
a trustworthy face.

185
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:43,636
About your husband,
he felt differently.

186
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:45,939
Oh.
You got our flyer.

187
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:49,345
The master had wished
to meet you tomorrow evening.

188
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:50,473
Oh, I'm so sorry.

189
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:53,518
But tomorrow I've got plans
that can't be broken.

190
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:54,644
Who is that?

191
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,085
- Excuse me a second.
- Who is that?

192
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,350
Just someone calling
about repping a house.

193
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:00,619
What's the address?
Where is it?

194
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:04,429
Sara, do you know
where this place is?

195
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,795
The places up here are big
multimillion-dollar mansions.

196
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:07,992
This could be big.

197
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:10,695
And what about
our big family adventure?

198
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:13,697
It's just a little detour.

199
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:15,400
How long is it gonna take?

200
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:17,442
No more than 20 minutes.
20 minutes tops.

201
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,102
You kids should be excited.

202
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,476
You're gonna see Mommy and Daddy
in real- estate action.

203
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:25,308
Somebody's calling me.
Who's calling me?

204
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:28,484
Hello. Jim Evers,
Evers & Evers Real Estate.

205
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:31,990
Stan, how you doing?
What's the latest?

206
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,917
Really?
The Selmer property?

207
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:36,393
Tomorrow?

208
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:39,488
Wow. I'm kind of out of town
right now.

209
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:43,228
Hey. But, hey, listen.
Maybe I could come back early.

210
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:45,634
Oh, no.
I can't come back early.

211
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,138
No, I can't come back early.

212
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,197
Maybe we should just take care
of this on Monday.

213
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:50,264
All right?

214
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:51,331
Monday?

215
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:52,934
Monday sounds fantastic.

216
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:54,741
Okay.
I'll talk to you on Monday.

217
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:56,645
We're gonna talk on Monday.

218
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:02,313
Are we still in America?

219
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,726
Here it is, right here.
Okay? All right?

220
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:21,496
Yeah, that's a whole lot
of gate.

221
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,202
They must have a big
possum problem down here.

222
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:25,971
That's some big possum.

223
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,018
Didn't they know we were coming?

224
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,247
Of course they knew.

225
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:39,655
Maybe there's a call box
or something.

226
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:42,455
Hello?!

227
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:46,491
Hello!
The Evers are here!

228
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,930
Yes, we're here now!

229
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:55,604
Nobody's answering.

230
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:58,905
Now I got to get out in the dirt
with my brand- new shoes on.

231
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:14,917
Wow.

232
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:18,863
How are we gonna get in?

233
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:22,431
What if you give me a boost,
and I'll go around the back?

234
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:23,729
They're probably old.
We'll surprise them.

235
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,395
You'll probably kill them.

236
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,769
Let's just go.
It's getting late.

237
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,203
You know, Sara,
you give up too easy.

238
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:33,609
You got to be more patient.
The Evers way is to be patient.

239
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:44,188
All right.
We're in business.

240
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:46,190
Let's go, let's go.

241
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:48,089
Let's do this.

242
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:26,860
Wow.

243
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:30,493
Bob Vila would have
a field day with this place.

244
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:32,662
Hey, Megan,
don't slam the door like that.

245
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:34,433
It's very sensitive.

246
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:35,973
It's a car, Dad.

247
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,168
Ah!
It's not just a car.

248
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:40,269
It's a very delicate piece
of machinery.

249
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:42,610
Shh. She didn't mean
what she just said.

250
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:44,308
She didn't mean that.

251
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,010
Come on.
Let's see what's around back.

252
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:47,814
I'm getting hungry.

253
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:48,876
Me too.

254
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:50,512
Don't worry.
We'll be 20 minutes tops.

255
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:52,318
Hey, Dad,
when we get to the lake,

256
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:55,053
can I go to that pizza shop
where I ate that whole pizza,

257
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:56,389
and when we got to the cabin,

258
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:59,363
I threw up and you still saw
the pepperoni chunks in it?

259
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:02,764
Yeah, we can go there if we can
avoid a repeat performance.

260
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:07,804
Wow.

261
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:10,068
Now, that's something
you don't see every day.

262
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:13,771
Oh, my God.

263
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:14,938
Dead people?

264
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:16,481
Hey, honey.

265
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:20,382
You know they have, uh,
dead people in the backyard?

266
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:22,818
Well, some people have pools.

267
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:25,516
Some people have private
cemeteries. It happens.

268
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,151
You're gonna sell a house
with this?

269
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:31,196
This historical sprawling manor
with spacious grounds? Yes.

270
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,458
Hey, that's good.
We'll put that on the listing.

271
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:35,295
And leave out
all the dead people?

272
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:37,927
We'll just stick
to the bright side.

273
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:40,995
Oh, no.
I got my good suit on.

274
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:47,475
Oh.

275
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:48,706
You think it's gonna stop?

276
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,341
Oh, I hope it's not raining
at the lake.

277
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,051
When you're at work
with Mommy and Daddy,

278
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,246
you're always on
your best behavior, right?

279
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:58,119
Okay.
Whoo!

280
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,055
Look at the size
of these knockers.

281
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,116
Ever see anything
like that before?

282
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:05,462
Hello?!
Evers Real Estate!

283
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:10,462
Evers Real Estate!

284
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,407
Hello?

285
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,343
Is anybody home?

286
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,189
Hello?

287
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:36,955
We're the Evers from
Evers & Evers Real Estate.

288
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:40,296
Hi!

289
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:47,971
Have you ever seen
anything like this?

290
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,029
Never.

291
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:52,339
Sara, this puts us
in a whole new league.

292
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,275
Smells like Grandma's house.

293
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,372
Worse.
Smells like Grandma.

294
00:16:57,449 --> 00:16:58,711
This place is just
a little dusty.

295
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:00,945
We'll get a cleaning crew to
come out here and shine it up.

296
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,751
This place would be sparkling
from top to bottom.

297
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:08,122
Mom, this place has spiders.

298
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:31,278
Sara Evers.

299
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,147
Yes, I'm Sara.

300
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:36,779
My name is Ramsley.

301
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:41,751
Hello, Ramsley.

302
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:44,523
I'm Jim Evers
of Evers & Evers Real Estate

303
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:46,621
at your service.

304
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:51,597
We were not expecting... others.

305
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:54,833
Yes, we were on our way
out of town.

306
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,034
Yeah, then when we realized
the enormity

307
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:59,168
and complexity
of your unique estate,

308
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:00,973
we wanted to commit
the full resources

309
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:02,479
of Evers & Evers Real Estate.

310
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:05,483
At Evers & Evers, we want you
to be happy forevers and evers.

311
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:07,416
Please accept
this waterproof calendar

312
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:10,148
as a token of our appreciation.

313
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:14,958
Very well.

314
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:18,019
We shall have to place
other settings.

315
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,530
Who do you have
the settings for?

316
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:24,797
Master Gracey wishes to discuss
his affairs over dinner.

317
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,031
Oh, I'm afraid we have plans.

318
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,767
Honey, we can't stay for dinner.

319
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:30,468
Oh, yes.
But we mustn't be rude, darling.

320
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:32,134
What about our family adventure?

321
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:33,109
Yeah, Dad.

322
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:35,612
We'll just have some soup,
and then we'll get going, okay?

323
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:37,012
All right?

324
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,451
Wow.

325
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:00,134
Wow.

326
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:04,341
Nice.
Very nice.

327
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:06,639
Good job.
Good job.

328
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:09,704
Hey, Megan, how'd you like to
eat like this every day at home?

329
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:15,543
The master will be
with you shortly.

330
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:18,985
Carry on.

331
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:27,131
I said, "Carry on."
He walks off.

332
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:33,097
Have you ever seen
a fireplace this amazing?

333
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,265
Incredible.

334
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,832
Ah, we could have one heck of a
wienie roast in that thing, huh?

335
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:41,436
Seriously.
Look at this detail.

336
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,037
I've never seen
anything like this.

337
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:46,573
- Haven't you?

338
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:50,850
My grandfather spared no expense
when he built this mansion.

339
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:54,256
Well, your grandfather had
really good taste in tchotchkes.

340
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:55,850
I'm Jim Evers
of Evers & Evers Real Estate.

341
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:58,021
Charmed to make
your acquaintance, sir.

342
00:19:58,096 --> 00:20:00,929
Edward.
Edward Gracey.

343
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:09,306
Uh, this is my wife, Sara.

344
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,205
You want to come meet
Mr. Gracey?

345
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:13,744
Very nice to meet you,
Mr. Gracey.

346
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:17,441
And this is our daughter, Megan,
and our son, Michael.

347
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:25,221
You have very beautiful
children, Ms. Evers.

348
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:28,123
I kicked in
some chromosomes, too.

349
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,591
Children.
Madam.

350
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:34,928
Oh. Nice.

351
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,763
Okay.

352
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:41,736
Thank you.

353
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:43,502
The master was very pleased

354
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:46,976
when he heard you could come
on such short notice.

355
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:50,708
Normally we would not have
called you here so abruptly.

356
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:52,773
But we had no other choice.

357
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:54,716
What do you got,
termites or something?

358
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:56,913
Big house like this must have
a lot of termites.

359
00:20:56,989 --> 00:21:01,824
No. But lately there have been
more... disturbances.

360
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:05,458
What do you think
of the house, Ms. Evers?

361
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:07,657
Oh.

362
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:10,031
I think it's
absolutely incredible.

363
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,002
The Italian influence.

364
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,765
The Renaissance style
of the molding.

365
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:16,364
The attention to detail
is stunning.

366
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,774
You never see houses like this.
Or at least I don't.

367
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:24,282
Great care and love went into
the building of this mansion.

368
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:40,823
This house is my inheritance.

369
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:42,833
My birthright.

370
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:46,399
But lately it's become
too much to bear.

371
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,501
Tell me, Mr. Evers.

372
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:52,372
Do you believe in ghosts?

373
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:54,173
Ghosts?

374
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:56,908
Yeah. Sure.
I believe in ghosts. Yeah.

375
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,542
I don't think it's a good idea
to put that on the listing.

376
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:01,677
You should talk about how many
bathrooms are in the house.

377
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:02,685
People love bathrooms.

378
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:05,382
We should play up the toilet
angle and leave out ghosts.

379
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:07,049
I think that'd be best.

380
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:11,192
The storm has swollen the river.

381
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:12,093
How's that?

382
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:15,497
The storm has flooded the road.

383
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:20,435
I'm afraid there will be
no leaving the mansion tonight.

384
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,097
What?

385
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:28,010
Of course you are all more than
welcome to spend the night here.

386
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:29,979
Oh, no.
I really don't think we should.

387
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:31,948
We've got plans.

388
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:35,851
I'm afraid there's no other way.

389
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:39,379
Ramsley will show you
to your rooms.

390
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:57,634
I believe the children will be
comfortable in this room.

391
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:01,335
Yeah.
Real homey.

392
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:03,540
You'll be fine.

393
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:06,140
Wow.
Hey, listen.

394
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,982
When you flush the toilet, check
and see how quickly it refills.

395
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,078
Good night, Dad.

396
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:11,645
Good night.

397
00:23:16,861 --> 00:23:21,457
I hope you and the madame will
find this room to your liking.

398
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:22,625
Yeah.
It's great.

399
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:24,896
It'll be like spending the night
in a fine hotel.

400
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,632
Will there be anything else
that you require, sir?

401
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:29,401
Are you gonna get us
some chocolates?

402
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:30,270
Pardon?

403
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:32,537
You know, the little chocolates
they put on the hotel pillows.

404
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:34,442
Sometimes they have chocolates
on the pillow.

405
00:23:34,512 --> 00:23:36,980
They have little chocolates
on the pillows...

406
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:38,709
to have.

407
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:41,649
What's the problem?

408
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:46,918
In the first place,

409
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:48,721
we weren't even supposed to
be here.

410
00:23:48,793 --> 00:23:50,158
We were supposed to be
at the lake.

411
00:23:50,228 --> 00:23:52,594
What am I supposed to do,
control the weather now, Sara?

412
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:53,722
That's not the point.

413
00:23:53,798 --> 00:23:56,096
You couldn't resist.
You just had to come.

414
00:23:56,167 --> 00:23:59,000
Excuse me. This is a big
opportunity for all of us.

415
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:01,061
Not for us, for you.

416
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:03,801
The only thing you seem to care
about anymore is work.

417
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:05,866
Oh, but when I'm working hard,
it doesn't matter

418
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:08,538
as long as I'm bringing you
home expensive gifts, right?

419
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:13,212
Hey, what are you...
Hey, Sara.

420
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,344
Hey, Sara, I didn't
mean to say that, okay?

421
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,717
Sara.

422
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:17,982
Come on.
Stop it.

423
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:19,717
Sara.
Sara.

424
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:23,352
I'm sorry about that, honey.
Can you open up, please?

425
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:29,690
Aah!
Ooh.

426
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:30,701
You scared me.

427
00:24:31,569 --> 00:24:33,560
- Pardon the intrusion, sir.
- Yes.

428
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:36,402
The master was wondering
if he might have a word with you

429
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:37,566
in the library.

430
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,837
A word? Okay. I'd love to have
a word with him.

431
00:24:39,911 --> 00:24:41,640
Sure.
Let's go talk some turkey.

432
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:43,874
Yes. Turkey.

433
00:24:43,948 --> 00:24:45,438
- Very good, sir.
- Yeah.

434
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:48,145
If you will kindly follow me.

435
00:24:48,219 --> 00:24:49,243
Yeah. Of course.
Of course.

436
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:52,154
Hey, Sara, I'm gonna have a word
with Mr. Gracey.

437
00:24:52,223 --> 00:24:54,191
I'll be back in a minute.

438
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:57,528
Ramsley, I was just wondering.

439
00:24:57,595 --> 00:24:59,187
Have you ever been
to a tanning salon?

440
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:01,164
I've got a friend who's got
a really great place.

441
00:25:01,232 --> 00:25:02,790
You can get a really smooth tan.

442
00:25:02,867 --> 00:25:05,802
Do something about
that ashy white look.

443
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:07,735
I'm sure the ladies
would love it.

444
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:10,866
Yes.
Sounds wonderful.

445
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:16,477
Would you care for a drink, sir,
while you're waiting?

446
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:19,142
Yeah. Don't mind if I do.
Thank you, Ramsley.

447
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:21,276
Oh, wow!

448
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,878
Now, that's class.
That's what I need to do.

449
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:26,355
Get a big picture of myself
to put on the living room wall.

450
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:28,654
Adds a touch of elegance
to the room.

451
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:32,629
Yes, sir.
Very elegant.

452
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:35,188
Thank you.
Thank you so much, Ramsley.

453
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,102
Mmm.

454
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,762
So, Ramsley, how long
you been a butler?

455
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,431
A long time.

456
00:25:42,507 --> 00:25:44,270
What are the most
important qualifications

457
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:47,402
in case I might be doing
some interviewing?

458
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:50,073
Attending to every detail.

459
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:52,412
Understanding priorities.

460
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:57,148
And above all,
knowing one's place.

461
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,747
What does your boss like to do?
What's he into?

462
00:25:59,824 --> 00:26:02,224
You know, what floats his boat?

463
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:07,127
The master likes
a great many things.

464
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:11,862
Art, literature, beauty.

465
00:26:11,936 --> 00:26:13,733
And all that stuff about ghosts.

466
00:26:13,805 --> 00:26:16,672
Did he get, like, a bad clam
in his jambalaya one night?

467
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:19,642
You don't believe
in ghosts, sir?

468
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:22,111
Absolutely not.
Let me tell you something.

469
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:24,648
The way I see it, you only go
around the track once.

470
00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:28,117
So you do it full-out
all the way around.

471
00:26:28,186 --> 00:26:32,316
Mr. Evers, may I confide in you?

472
00:26:33,057 --> 00:26:34,024
Please do.

473
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:36,083
The master is not well.

474
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:38,527
He must leave this house,
Mr. Evers.

475
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:40,427
He must move on.

476
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:44,127
It is of the gravest importance,
I assure you.

477
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:48,536
Or I fear the very worst.

478
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:52,467
I can't believe this.

479
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,239
Still no reception.

480
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:56,803
We had to take
that little detour.

481
00:26:56,881 --> 00:26:59,008
20 minutes tops.
Yeah, right.

482
00:26:59,083 --> 00:27:01,017
Do you think it's gonna stop
raining soon?

483
00:27:01,085 --> 00:27:04,213
How should I know?
I'm not the weatherman.

484
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:06,814
Hmm.

485
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:10,090
Stogies.

486
00:27:11,362 --> 00:27:12,386
Not bad.

487
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:15,297
Not at all.
Hold onto that.

488
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:20,027
Hmm.
Hmm.

489
00:27:20,104 --> 00:27:21,264
Wonderful.

490
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:25,070
Must be nice.
Must be really nice.

491
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:26,770
I tell ya.

492
00:27:26,845 --> 00:27:28,540
Ahh.

493
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,642
Hmm.

494
00:27:34,886 --> 00:27:36,513
Hello there, good man.

495
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:38,021
Ramsley,
fix the gentleman a drink.

496
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:40,580
Nigel, I just recently returned
from the Continent,

497
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:42,285
where I found
the most interesting book.

498
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,624
Yes, it was called
"Raising the Dead."

499
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:46,664
Oh! Oh, cripes.

500
00:27:46,731 --> 00:27:49,700
Oh.
I hope that doesn't stain.

501
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:51,901
Oh.

502
00:28:02,146 --> 00:28:03,738
Wow.

503
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:20,454
Interesting.

504
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:28,801
Wow.

505
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:38,580
Wow.
I wonder where this leads to.

506
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:40,083
Hey!

507
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:41,846
Hey!

508
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,979
Hey, open this back up!

509
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:46,387
Hey, open up!

510
00:28:46,457 --> 00:28:47,389
Ramsley!

511
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,391
Ramsley!

512
00:28:50,461 --> 00:28:52,520
Push back the head!

513
00:28:53,364 --> 00:28:55,924
Hey, will somebody push
the head back?

514
00:29:29,233 --> 00:29:30,996
Megan!

515
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:38,801
What do you think it is?

516
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:44,848
It's a ghost ball.

517
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:03,393
I think it wants us
to follow it.

518
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:06,964
I think you're crazy.

519
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:16,739
It does.
It wants us to follow it.

520
00:30:32,063 --> 00:30:33,724
Hey, Megan, wait up!

521
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:43,269
Where's that scary albino
when you need him?

522
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,607
Oh.
Hello.

523
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:55,410
Have you seen my husband?

524
00:30:59,857 --> 00:31:01,518
Excuse me.

525
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:04,256
Wait!

526
00:31:05,229 --> 00:31:06,719
Wait!

527
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:27,443
Oh, Ramsley.
It's you.

528
00:31:27,518 --> 00:31:28,815
May I help you?

529
00:31:28,886 --> 00:31:29,978
Yes.

530
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,988
I was just looking
for my husband.

531
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:34,115
Ah, indeed.

532
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:36,888
I left him in the library.

533
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:39,486
Right through there.

534
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:44,865
Honey, it's late.
Let's not fight anymore.

535
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:46,403
Come to bed?

536
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:48,769
Oh!
I'm sorry.

537
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,239
I thought you were my husband.

538
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:51,502
Can I help you with that?

539
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:54,170
Ramsley hates it
when I leave things lying about.

540
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:56,907
Yes.
He seems a bit proper.

541
00:31:56,981 --> 00:31:58,778
He strikes most people that way.

542
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:01,512
Once you get to know him,
you'll find that's not the case.

543
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,986
But he's really...

544
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:07,915
He's really very sweet.

545
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:09,619
Thank you.

546
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:11,594
He's been like a father to me.

547
00:32:11,662 --> 00:32:15,462
Mr. Gracey,
may I ask you something?

548
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:18,434
Yes. Of course.
Anything.

549
00:32:18,503 --> 00:32:19,663
This house.

550
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:22,001
It's been in your family
for generations.

551
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:24,598
It's your home.

552
00:32:24,675 --> 00:32:27,007
Why do you want to sell it?

553
00:32:28,412 --> 00:32:33,213
These walls are filled
with so many memories.

554
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:37,516
Some of them painful.

555
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:44,484
I think for you to understand,
I really must show you.

556
00:32:45,963 --> 00:32:49,592
It's all right.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

557
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:54,367
Although it might be
a bit worn and faded

558
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:56,134
from its original grandeur,

559
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:59,335
this house was once filled
with so many things.

560
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:00,968
So much life.

561
00:33:01,045 --> 00:33:06,813
With grand parties, dancing,
laughter, and, above all, hope.

562
00:33:06,884 --> 00:33:09,682
Being a Gracey meant
that you were denied nothing.

563
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:11,483
The world was yours.

564
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:14,423
What happened here, Mr. Gracey?

565
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:15,584
She did.

566
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,685
Who?

567
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:19,525
Elizabeth.

568
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:23,465
Hers is the story
that haunts these walls.

569
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:50,256
Come on.

570
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:52,455
Megan, wait.

571
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:55,021
You don't know the last time
that thing's been inspected.

572
00:33:55,099 --> 00:33:59,092
Would you just relax?
Where's your sense of adventure?

573
00:34:10,147 --> 00:34:12,308
This is against
all my better judgment.

574
00:34:45,816 --> 00:34:47,784
Hi!

575
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:54,214
Is anyone home?

576
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:16,778
Those must be termites.

577
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,808
Some big-ass termites.
That's all.

578
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:21,377
Hello?

579
00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:38,223
- Oh!

580
00:36:38,295 --> 00:36:39,887
Oh.

581
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:44,328
Aah! Aah!

582
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,157
Megan!

583
00:37:23,707 --> 00:37:25,675
Mom.

584
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:28,075
What are you doing here?
You're not supposed to be here!

585
00:37:28,145 --> 00:37:30,636
This is unspeakable!
Unspeakable! You have to leave!

586
00:37:30,714 --> 00:37:33,444
- Who is that?
- That's none of your business.

587
00:37:33,517 --> 00:37:35,883
Now, come on. Get out of here.
It's way past your bedtime.

588
00:37:35,953 --> 00:37:37,181
Her name was Elizabeth.

589
00:37:37,254 --> 00:37:39,415
Are you kids hungry?
Does anybody want a cookie?

590
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:40,855
Cookies?!

591
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:43,416
Don't offer them cookies!
They're trespassers!

592
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:45,689
Trespassers don't get cookies!

593
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,253
This is none of their concern.

594
00:37:47,331 --> 00:37:49,162
It is their concern!
They're involved!

595
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:53,460
Hide! Hide!

596
00:38:04,815 --> 00:38:08,273
The children are not
in their room.

597
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:09,717
Have you seen them?

598
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:11,516
Children?
What children?

599
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:14,149
What children?

600
00:38:20,264 --> 00:38:21,663
Her children.

601
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:25,133
The children
she wasn't supposed to bring.

602
00:38:25,202 --> 00:38:28,933
Along with that brainless
husband of hers.

603
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:31,265
Thank you.

604
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:40,850
If I had to listen
to another word

605
00:38:40,918 --> 00:38:44,410
from that insufferable fool,
I think I would have burst.

606
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:47,582
Of course, sir.
What a fool!

607
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,819
Did I not tell her
to come alone?

608
00:38:49,894 --> 00:38:52,954
Is it really too much to ask
for a little cooperation?

609
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,088
A little order?

610
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,360
Of course not, sir.

611
00:38:56,433 --> 00:39:00,563
If you find the children,
bring them to me.

612
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:02,071
- Certainly, sir.
- Yes, sir.

613
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:04,903
The final arrangements
have been made.

614
00:39:04,975 --> 00:39:08,638
Nothing further will interfere
with the master's plan.

615
00:39:19,022 --> 00:39:22,423
Thank God I heard your voice.
I lost my way.

616
00:39:22,525 --> 00:39:23,890
I don't know how to get out
of here.

617
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,791
I'm sorry if I sound
a little frazzled.

618
00:39:25,862 --> 00:39:28,296
I just had myself
a little freak show back there.

619
00:39:28,364 --> 00:39:30,127
It's time to respond.

620
00:39:30,199 --> 00:39:31,962
I was supposed to meet
with Mr. Gracey.

621
00:39:32,035 --> 00:39:34,401
But I got stuck in the wall.

622
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:37,803
Goblins and ghoulies
from last Halloween,

623
00:39:37,874 --> 00:39:41,469
awaken the spirits
with your tambourine.

624
00:39:41,544 --> 00:39:44,342
Okay, I hear you, but I don't
see you. Where are you?

625
00:39:44,414 --> 00:39:50,683
I am Madame Leota, seer of all,
voice to the spirits.

626
00:39:50,753 --> 00:39:53,085
Whom do you seek?

627
00:39:55,458 --> 00:39:56,982
Hey! Hey!

628
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,254
Hey, let me out of here!

629
00:39:58,327 --> 00:40:00,761
Silence!
Whom do you seek?

630
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:02,661
I am seeking a way out of here.

631
00:40:02,732 --> 00:40:04,324
Then you must look within.

632
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,924
I don't want to look within.
I want to look without.

633
00:40:06,002 --> 00:40:07,970
There is great evil
in this house.

634
00:40:08,037 --> 00:40:11,006
A devil's curse.
It seeks to destroy you.

635
00:40:11,074 --> 00:40:12,405
Why would something seek
to destroy me?

636
00:40:12,475 --> 00:40:13,806
I'm just here to sell the house.

637
00:40:13,876 --> 00:40:17,277
Dark spirits from the grave,
come forth.

638
00:40:17,346 --> 00:40:20,679
Lift us from the black
and show us.

639
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:22,615
Show us the way back.

640
00:40:22,685 --> 00:40:24,448
Dark spirits?
Hey, no dark spirits.

641
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,919
Don't you make no dark spirits
come out.

642
00:40:25,988 --> 00:40:28,980
Lift us.
Lift us up to the light.

643
00:40:29,058 --> 00:40:31,925
And lead us through
this stormy night.

644
00:40:31,994 --> 00:40:34,292
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey!

645
00:40:34,363 --> 00:40:36,490
Hey, I'd really like to stay
on the ground.

646
00:40:36,566 --> 00:40:38,557
I'd rather stay on the ground.
Can I stay on the ground?

647
00:40:38,634 --> 00:40:41,762
Evil and darkness have fallen
this night.

648
00:40:41,838 --> 00:40:45,171
But now to survive,
you must gain new sight.

649
00:40:45,241 --> 00:40:46,868
I must first gain new underwear.

650
00:40:46,943 --> 00:40:49,343
Only the light will lead
the way.

651
00:40:49,412 --> 00:40:51,778
Follow it and find
your way home.

652
00:40:51,848 --> 00:40:55,284
There's no place like home.
There's no place like home.

653
00:40:55,351 --> 00:40:58,115
Go, Mr. Evers.
Your family is at stake.

654
00:40:58,187 --> 00:41:01,554
Your very life is at stake.
Break the curse.

655
00:41:01,624 --> 00:41:04,559
There is no escape for you
unless you lift this spell.

656
00:41:04,627 --> 00:41:06,390
Go.
Save yourself.

657
00:41:06,462 --> 00:41:08,123
Save your family.

658
00:41:08,197 --> 00:41:11,064
Release her.
Release us all!

659
00:41:11,134 --> 00:41:13,364
I'm getting so queasy.
I'm getting very queasy.

660
00:41:20,576 --> 00:41:22,407
Oh!

661
00:41:27,817 --> 00:41:31,685
Aah! Aah!

662
00:41:48,504 --> 00:41:50,495
Aah! Aah!

663
00:41:51,841 --> 00:41:54,071
Aah!

664
00:41:59,682 --> 00:42:01,047
Oh!

665
00:42:07,356 --> 00:42:09,085
- Dad!
- Dad!

666
00:42:09,158 --> 00:42:10,750
Hey!
Michael and Megan, you okay?

667
00:42:10,826 --> 00:42:12,020
We're fine, thanks.

668
00:42:12,094 --> 00:42:13,755
Get your things.
Let's get out of here.

669
00:42:13,829 --> 00:42:14,796
We have a problem.

670
00:42:14,864 --> 00:42:16,889
Because of the rain?
We're gonna get a little wet.

671
00:42:16,966 --> 00:42:18,934
Let's just find your mom
and get out of here.

672
00:42:19,001 --> 00:42:21,595
I'm afraid that's not possible.
She can't leave.

673
00:42:21,671 --> 00:42:22,660
And why not?

674
00:42:22,738 --> 00:42:23,705
Because she can't!

675
00:42:23,773 --> 00:42:27,209
If I could tell you, I would.
But I can't, so I won't, okay?

676
00:42:27,276 --> 00:42:28,937
Hey, how'd you...

677
00:42:29,845 --> 00:42:30,777
Hey, look.
Come on.

678
00:42:30,846 --> 00:42:32,939
Daddy's having
more hallucinations. Let's go.

679
00:42:33,015 --> 00:42:34,880
- They're ghosts, Dad.
- They're not ghosts.

680
00:42:34,951 --> 00:42:37,283
We're just having hallucinations
from that dinner we ate.

681
00:42:37,353 --> 00:42:39,446
It was that chicken.
It didn't taste right.

682
00:42:39,522 --> 00:42:40,819
- Oh!
- It's not the chicken!

683
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:43,324
All right. It's not the chicken.
But we're getting out of here.

684
00:42:43,392 --> 00:42:44,654
But we have to help them.

685
00:42:44,727 --> 00:42:47,787
You can't help the dead, honey.
They're beyond help.

686
00:42:47,863 --> 00:42:49,125
The man's talking sense.

687
00:42:49,198 --> 00:42:51,632
Everyone should keep their noses
in their own business.

688
00:42:51,701 --> 00:42:53,566
But we have to help them
break the curse.

689
00:42:53,636 --> 00:42:55,467
Why is everybody talking
about a curse?

690
00:42:55,538 --> 00:42:57,768
Have you been talking
to that crazy green gypsy

691
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:58,966
in the giant paperweight?

692
00:42:59,041 --> 00:43:00,633
We've got to go back to see her.

693
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:03,110
- No back. I'm not going back.
- But, Dad!

694
00:43:03,179 --> 00:43:05,044
They had me floating
all around the room.

695
00:43:05,114 --> 00:43:06,809
Hey, I was strapped to a chair,

696
00:43:06,882 --> 00:43:08,850
floating around the room
with a marching band chasing me.

697
00:43:08,918 --> 00:43:10,613
I'm not going back anywhere!
Forget it, Casper!

698
00:43:10,686 --> 00:43:12,847
But Mom's in trouble.

699
00:43:12,922 --> 00:43:14,514
What kind of trouble?

700
00:43:27,136 --> 00:43:31,903
She died here in this house.

701
00:43:31,974 --> 00:43:34,340
She was so very young.

702
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:37,777
So very beautiful.

703
00:43:37,847 --> 00:43:41,749
She was in love with the heir
to this mansion.

704
00:43:41,817 --> 00:43:43,580
Your grandfather.

705
00:43:43,653 --> 00:43:48,556
And he loved her
more than life itself.

706
00:43:49,191 --> 00:43:55,187
But they were from different
worlds and couldn't be together.

707
00:43:57,633 --> 00:44:00,431
How did she die, Mr. Gracey?

708
00:44:00,503 --> 00:44:02,630
She took her own life.

709
00:44:02,705 --> 00:44:04,366
Poison.

710
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:08,376
After that,
his life became unbearable.

711
00:44:08,444 --> 00:44:13,381
And so, without hope,
without love,

712
00:44:13,449 --> 00:44:16,577
without Elizabeth,

713
00:44:16,652 --> 00:44:18,984
he hung himself.

714
00:44:20,523 --> 00:44:27,019
His soul wanders these halls,
waiting for her to return.

715
00:44:29,799 --> 00:44:32,632
If you listen carefully,

716
00:44:32,702 --> 00:44:38,971
you can still hear the beating
of his broken heart.

717
00:44:47,917 --> 00:44:49,407
Wait a minute.
Hold it a second.

718
00:44:49,485 --> 00:44:51,043
You're telling me
this guy is dead

719
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:52,451
and the reason
we were brought here

720
00:44:52,521 --> 00:44:54,421
is he wants to try to get jiggy
with my wife?

721
00:44:54,490 --> 00:44:57,084
Pretty much.
Are you upset?

722
00:44:57,159 --> 00:44:59,821
The guy is dead, and he's
trying to get with my wife!

723
00:44:59,895 --> 00:45:01,362
And the house isn't really
for sale!

724
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:03,421
Yes, I'm upset!

725
00:45:03,499 --> 00:45:06,525
Oh, Madame Leota, is it her?

726
00:45:06,602 --> 00:45:10,402
Is she truly our dear, departed
Elizabeth come back to us?

727
00:45:10,473 --> 00:45:13,465
It is true.
She walks these halls.

728
00:45:13,542 --> 00:45:15,510
You see?
I told you it is her!

729
00:45:15,578 --> 00:45:17,808
But do not be deceived.

730
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:20,576
All things are not
as they appear.

731
00:45:20,716 --> 00:45:23,913
For the curse to be lifted,
the truth must be known.

732
00:45:23,986 --> 00:45:27,251
And for the truth to be known,
you must find the key.

733
00:45:27,323 --> 00:45:29,416
What are you talking about,
ball lady? What key?

734
00:45:29,492 --> 00:45:32,086
Enter the tomb
under the great dead oak

735
00:45:32,161 --> 00:45:34,686
and travel down deep
under the ground.

736
00:45:34,764 --> 00:45:38,063
And there you will find the key
that must be found.

737
00:45:38,134 --> 00:45:40,967
Find the black crypt
that bears no name,

738
00:45:41,036 --> 00:45:43,834
or soon your fate will be
the same.

739
00:45:43,906 --> 00:45:45,703
You're telling me all I have to
do is find this key,

740
00:45:45,775 --> 00:45:48,073
then I'm gonna walk out of here
with my wife and kids?

741
00:45:48,144 --> 00:45:51,011
The key is the answer to all.

742
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:52,945
Well, great. I'm in.
Let's get this key.

743
00:45:53,015 --> 00:45:54,846
There's only one problem.

744
00:45:54,917 --> 00:45:56,578
How do we get out of here?

745
00:45:56,652 --> 00:45:58,586
Yeah, how do we get out of here?

746
00:45:58,654 --> 00:46:04,217
Well, there's always, uh,
my way.

747
00:46:10,499 --> 00:46:13,434
Hey! I thought you said
you could drive this thing!

748
00:46:13,502 --> 00:46:15,993
Don't you worry.
I know exactly what I'm doing.

749
00:46:17,039 --> 00:46:18,666
- Aah!
- Aah!

750
00:46:21,343 --> 00:46:23,504
Well, you better just keep
your eyes on the road!

751
00:46:23,579 --> 00:46:25,206
- Move over!
- What are you doing?

752
00:46:25,281 --> 00:46:27,374
If you keep driving,
you'll kill us all!

753
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:28,576
That's where you're wrong.

754
00:46:28,651 --> 00:46:30,482
Because some of us
are already dead!

755
00:46:36,125 --> 00:46:37,786
Dad, look.

756
00:46:55,144 --> 00:46:57,908
Ready?
Fire!

757
00:47:14,263 --> 00:47:15,093
Dad?

758
00:47:15,164 --> 00:47:15,926
Yes, son?

759
00:47:15,998 --> 00:47:18,489
I see dead people.

760
00:47:24,673 --> 00:47:25,901
Excuse me.

761
00:47:25,975 --> 00:47:28,239
Why are all these ghosts
still hanging around here?

762
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:30,676
When they died,
they couldn't find the light.

763
00:47:30,746 --> 00:47:32,213
And now...

764
00:47:32,281 --> 00:47:34,181
Now they're trapped.

765
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:38,050
Doomed to wander the Earth
for all eternity.

766
00:47:41,857 --> 00:47:44,291
Nice.
Nice job.

767
00:47:57,673 --> 00:47:59,368
Whoa!

768
00:48:00,776 --> 00:48:02,300
Okay.

769
00:48:02,378 --> 00:48:03,345
Hey!

770
00:48:03,412 --> 00:48:05,277
Hey, what are you doing here?

771
00:48:05,347 --> 00:48:06,837
Can they see us?

772
00:48:06,916 --> 00:48:08,713
No.
Of course not.

773
00:48:08,784 --> 00:48:11,617
Yes, I can. I'm looking at you
right now in your stupid hat.

774
00:48:11,687 --> 00:48:14,121
Don't listen to him.
He's lying.

775
00:48:15,624 --> 00:48:18,718
Whatever. Come on, kids.
Let's go. Come on.

776
00:48:19,528 --> 00:48:23,225
I could swear he was looking
right at me.

777
00:48:23,299 --> 00:48:25,494
He's psychic.

778
00:48:29,638 --> 00:48:32,607
This was to have been
her wedding dress.

779
00:48:32,675 --> 00:48:34,575
Oh, it's lovely.

780
00:48:34,643 --> 00:48:38,670
It would have been lovelier if
she'd had a chance to wear it.

781
00:48:38,747 --> 00:48:42,649
Now it serves
only as a dark reminder

782
00:48:42,718 --> 00:48:44,379
of what could have been.

783
00:48:44,453 --> 00:48:48,219
To love someone so much
and then lose them so suddenly.

784
00:48:48,290 --> 00:48:50,884
I can't imagine how awful
that must be.

785
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:53,952
If you truly love someone,
they never leave you.

786
00:48:54,029 --> 00:48:57,260
They remain in your heart
forever.

787
00:48:59,935 --> 00:49:01,766
Isn't that romantic?

788
00:49:01,837 --> 00:49:04,362
He was willing to throw
everything away for love.

789
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:07,238
Well, now he's broke, dead,
and cursed. Nice move.

790
00:49:07,309 --> 00:49:09,402
- Oh, crap!

791
00:49:09,478 --> 00:49:11,002
These are my new shoes.

792
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:12,411
Hey, kids, watch your step.

793
00:49:12,481 --> 00:49:13,743
- Oh, crap!

794
00:49:13,816 --> 00:49:15,249
Hey, Michael, don't say "crap."

795
00:49:15,284 --> 00:49:16,615
All right.
Where is this place?

796
00:49:16,785 --> 00:49:17,843
Okay, where are we?

797
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,683
I think the gypsy lady
said something

798
00:49:19,755 --> 00:49:21,382
about making a left at an oak.

799
00:49:21,457 --> 00:49:24,756
Okay.
Well, glad she was so specific.

800
00:49:29,732 --> 00:49:32,394
What is that?
Do you hear that?

801
00:49:32,468 --> 00:49:33,958
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

802
00:49:34,036 --> 00:49:36,231
And harmonize

803
00:49:36,305 --> 00:49:40,332
When we ghosts come out
to socialize

804
00:49:40,409 --> 00:49:42,070
Doom, doom, doom, doom

805
00:49:42,144 --> 00:49:43,975
When the cryptos creak
and the tombstones quake

806
00:49:44,046 --> 00:49:46,241
Spooks come out
for a swinging wake

807
00:49:46,315 --> 00:49:47,543
Excuse me.
Sorry to bother you.

808
00:49:47,616 --> 00:49:49,675
But we were wondering
if you happen to know

809
00:49:49,752 --> 00:49:50,980
where the mausoleum was.

810
00:49:51,053 --> 00:49:52,452
Down by the

811
00:49:52,521 --> 00:49:56,184
Old mill stream

812
00:49:56,258 --> 00:49:58,886
Where I first met you

813
00:49:58,961 --> 00:50:01,828
No, no. I think they said
it was an old oak.

814
00:50:01,897 --> 00:50:03,421
That's what they said.
It's by the...

815
00:50:03,499 --> 00:50:04,488
By the light

816
00:50:04,566 --> 00:50:06,193
By the light,
by the light

817
00:50:06,268 --> 00:50:09,066
Of the silvery moon

818
00:50:09,138 --> 00:50:11,265
Yeah. You sound really good.
Your harmony's tight.

819
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:13,865
But we're trying to find
my wife. She'll be...

820
00:50:13,942 --> 00:50:16,308
Comin' 'round the mountain
when she comes

821
00:50:16,378 --> 00:50:17,902
She'll be comin' 'round
the mountain...

822
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:20,005
Listen, guys.
I'm trying to find a key.

823
00:50:20,082 --> 00:50:21,447
I'm trying to find a key...

824
00:50:21,517 --> 00:50:23,917
Where's the key?
Where's the key?

825
00:50:23,986 --> 00:50:25,180
Where's the beautiful key?

826
00:50:25,254 --> 00:50:26,619
Find the key, find the key

827
00:50:26,689 --> 00:50:27,713
Oh, how happy you'll be

828
00:50:27,790 --> 00:50:30,850
The key that I'm trying to find
is in the mausoleum.

829
00:50:30,926 --> 00:50:32,757
The key is in the mausoleum.

830
00:50:32,828 --> 00:50:35,626
You left your key

831
00:50:35,698 --> 00:50:38,223
In a mausoleum

832
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:39,665
Down in Dixie

833
00:50:39,735 --> 00:50:41,430
Dad, there it is!

834
00:50:41,503 --> 00:50:43,562
- Dad, there it is
- Thanks.

835
00:50:43,639 --> 00:50:47,905
- Dad, there it is
- Thanks for nothing.

836
00:50:52,381 --> 00:50:54,679
Okay.
We made it.

837
00:50:58,187 --> 00:51:00,314
All right, kids.
Stay close.

838
00:51:07,362 --> 00:51:08,420
Hey.

839
00:51:14,503 --> 00:51:16,664
Look.

840
00:51:16,739 --> 00:51:17,933
It's a warning.

841
00:51:19,007 --> 00:51:20,565
Now, how do you know that?

842
00:51:20,642 --> 00:51:23,133
I studied Latin
for three years, Dad.

843
00:51:23,212 --> 00:51:24,975
You thought it was dumb,
remember?

844
00:51:25,047 --> 00:51:26,844
You said it was a dead language.

845
00:51:26,915 --> 00:51:29,816
Oh, we see how wrong I was
about that.

846
00:51:29,885 --> 00:51:33,116
"Beware all who enter.

847
00:51:33,188 --> 00:51:36,988
Here lies the passage
to the dead."

848
00:51:37,726 --> 00:51:40,058
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
Where are you going?

849
00:51:40,129 --> 00:51:42,620
- I don't like Latin.
- Hey, wait. Michael.

850
00:51:42,698 --> 00:51:44,962
You're 10 years old now.
You got to start being a man.

851
00:51:45,033 --> 00:51:48,093
I just turned 10.
I'm still getting used to it.

852
00:51:51,573 --> 00:51:52,767
Okay.
Here's what we do.

853
00:51:52,841 --> 00:51:54,502
Megan, stay here
with your brother.

854
00:51:54,576 --> 00:51:55,235
What?

855
00:51:55,310 --> 00:51:57,710
I'm not gonna leave him
out here by himself.

856
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:59,179
You guys stay together.

857
00:51:59,248 --> 00:52:01,307
I'll go in here,
and I'll take care of this.

858
00:52:01,383 --> 00:52:03,146
Okay.

859
00:52:03,218 --> 00:52:05,049
All right.

860
00:52:08,657 --> 00:52:10,147
Okay.

861
00:52:17,533 --> 00:52:19,194
Oh.

862
00:52:20,068 --> 00:52:22,502
Wow.

863
00:52:26,108 --> 00:52:27,700
Okay.

864
00:52:27,776 --> 00:52:29,437
All right.

865
00:52:33,382 --> 00:52:35,816
Okay.
I'll be right back.

866
00:52:35,884 --> 00:52:38,512
20 minutes tops, right?

867
00:52:38,587 --> 00:52:41,021
20 minutes tops.

868
00:53:22,497 --> 00:53:25,557
What was it that gypsy
told me to look for?

869
00:53:25,634 --> 00:53:28,603
Look for a crypt with...

870
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:30,934
Look for a crypt...

871
00:53:31,006 --> 00:53:33,031
- A crypt without a name.
- Aah!

872
00:53:33,108 --> 00:53:35,133
Oh!
What's the matter with you?

873
00:53:35,210 --> 00:53:37,644
You can't just be popping out
like that.

874
00:53:37,713 --> 00:53:39,203
I thought I told you
to wait with Michael.

875
00:53:39,281 --> 00:53:41,681
I was worried
you wouldn't find it.

876
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:44,514
Besides, Michael's fine.

877
00:53:44,586 --> 00:53:47,350
She said, "Find the black crypt
with no name,

878
00:53:47,422 --> 00:53:49,481
or soon your fate will be
the same."

879
00:53:56,632 --> 00:53:58,293
That must be it.

880
00:53:58,367 --> 00:54:00,528
Good hunch, Dad.

881
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:06,069
I'm officially starting
to get sick of this place.

882
00:54:06,141 --> 00:54:08,302
And we're here 'cause of who?

883
00:54:08,377 --> 00:54:11,437
Because I take seriously my
responsibility as breadwinner.

884
00:54:11,513 --> 00:54:13,879
I want you guys to have
everything I never had before.

885
00:54:13,949 --> 00:54:15,712
I didn't know you had
a bad childhood.

886
00:54:15,784 --> 00:54:17,183
I didn't have a bad childhood.

887
00:54:17,252 --> 00:54:19,220
Then why do we have to have
what you didn't have?

888
00:54:19,288 --> 00:54:21,017
Because...

889
00:54:21,089 --> 00:54:22,351
Hey, don't be tricking me,

890
00:54:22,424 --> 00:54:25,257
you little Latin-speaking
13-year-old.

891
00:54:25,327 --> 00:54:27,591
Let's just get this over with.
Hold this.

892
00:54:27,663 --> 00:54:29,995
Hold it with two hands, now.

893
00:54:43,645 --> 00:54:46,637
Aah! Phew!

894
00:54:48,617 --> 00:54:51,245
Oh, man.

895
00:54:53,422 --> 00:54:55,253
Excuse me one second.

896
00:54:55,324 --> 00:54:57,690
I'm sorry to bother you.

897
00:54:58,894 --> 00:55:00,885
Oh!

898
00:55:00,963 --> 00:55:03,363
Aah. Ugh.

899
00:55:03,432 --> 00:55:05,866
Oh, no.
Ew.

900
00:55:05,934 --> 00:55:09,131
Aah.

901
00:55:12,674 --> 00:55:14,301
Okay.
All right.

902
00:55:14,376 --> 00:55:16,970
Now, that wasn't hard, was it?

903
00:55:17,045 --> 00:55:18,512
Let's get out of here.

904
00:55:21,316 --> 00:55:23,147
That gypsy had me thinking
it was gonna be hard.

905
00:55:23,218 --> 00:55:25,049
- That was easy.

906
00:55:29,224 --> 00:55:30,657
Oh! Oh!

907
00:55:30,726 --> 00:55:32,193
Oh, no.

908
00:55:33,128 --> 00:55:35,096
Oh! Oh, no!

909
00:55:37,332 --> 00:55:39,732
Go get the key!
I'll take care of him!

910
00:55:41,703 --> 00:55:44,331
Hey, man, go on back to bed.
Get back in your bed.

911
00:55:44,406 --> 00:55:45,668
Go back to bed.

912
00:55:45,741 --> 00:55:47,800
I'm Jim Evers
of Evers & Evers Real Estate.

913
00:55:47,876 --> 00:55:49,537
Hey, look,
I don't want no trouble, man.

914
00:55:49,611 --> 00:55:51,841
The gypsy told me it was
all right to get the key, so...

915
00:55:51,913 --> 00:55:53,244
Oh!

916
00:55:54,416 --> 00:55:57,044
Just lighten up.
Now, let me tell you something.

917
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:59,917
I got to get my wife.
I don't want no trouble.

918
00:55:59,988 --> 00:56:01,979
Seriously, back up!

919
00:56:05,494 --> 00:56:07,291
You asked for it.

920
00:56:11,166 --> 00:56:12,531
Next time you're gonna
think twice

921
00:56:12,601 --> 00:56:15,536
before coming back
from the dead, ain't you?

922
00:56:15,604 --> 00:56:18,129
- Did you get the key?
- I'm looking! I'm looking!

923
00:56:18,206 --> 00:56:20,834
Take your time. Relax.
I have everything under control.

924
00:56:20,909 --> 00:56:23,434
I have everything
completely under control.

925
00:56:28,450 --> 00:56:30,213
Megan, you better look faster!

926
00:56:30,285 --> 00:56:32,845
Oh, I don't want to do this.

927
00:56:41,696 --> 00:56:43,664
Jeez.

928
00:57:09,758 --> 00:57:11,089
Aah!

929
00:57:13,829 --> 00:57:15,319
- Aah!

930
00:57:28,076 --> 00:57:29,976
Give me your hand.

931
00:57:33,882 --> 00:57:36,112
Okay.
Come on, come on, come on!

932
00:57:38,453 --> 00:57:40,614
Come on, guys!
Hurry up!

933
00:57:40,689 --> 00:57:41,553
Hold on!

934
00:57:41,623 --> 00:57:43,648
Come on, guys!
Hurry up!

935
00:57:44,893 --> 00:57:46,690
Michael!
Michael, open the door.

936
00:57:46,761 --> 00:57:49,229
Michael, it's locked
from the outside!

937
00:57:49,297 --> 00:57:51,959
Michael, open the door.
Open the door. Michael!

938
00:57:52,033 --> 00:57:54,729
Dad, there's spiders everywhere,
and I don't have a magazine.

939
00:57:54,803 --> 00:57:56,634
- Hey, Michael, are you scared?
- Uh-huh.

940
00:57:56,705 --> 00:57:59,731
Michael, it's okay to be scared.
Everybody gets scared sometimes.

941
00:57:59,808 --> 00:58:01,503
- Daddy's scared right now.
- You are?

942
00:58:01,576 --> 00:58:03,840
Yes, I'm very scared.
Now, please open the door, son!

943
00:58:03,912 --> 00:58:06,642
Michael, open the door,
or I'll kill you!

944
00:58:06,715 --> 00:58:07,739
That's great.
Keep him calm.

945
00:58:07,816 --> 00:58:09,807
Hey, Michael, listen,
it's okay to get scared.

946
00:58:09,885 --> 00:58:11,546
Everybody gets scared
now and then.

947
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:12,917
You just can't let it stop you.

948
00:58:12,988 --> 00:58:14,717
Michael, if you think
you're scared now,

949
00:58:14,789 --> 00:58:16,188
wait till the zombies come out!

950
00:58:16,258 --> 00:58:17,520
What zombies?

951
00:58:17,592 --> 00:58:18,616
Michael!
Hey, Michael, look.

952
00:58:18,693 --> 00:58:20,388
Just open the door.
Please, man.

953
00:58:20,462 --> 00:58:21,554
Open the door right now.

954
00:58:21,630 --> 00:58:22,756
Dad, they're coming!

955
00:58:24,499 --> 00:58:25,989
Michael, open the door
right now!

956
00:58:26,067 --> 00:58:29,434
Open the door!
Open the door!

957
00:58:29,504 --> 00:58:32,473
Open the door right now!
Open the door!

958
00:58:33,308 --> 00:58:34,969
Oh!

959
00:58:39,414 --> 00:58:40,904
Aah!

960
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:44,048
Lock it! Lock it!

961
00:58:44,119 --> 00:58:46,246
Okay.
Come on!

962
00:58:46,321 --> 00:58:47,413
All right.

963
00:58:47,489 --> 00:58:49,889
Okay. All right.
Get 'em off!

964
00:58:49,958 --> 00:58:51,949
Okay. Come on.
Get 'em off. Okay.

965
00:58:52,027 --> 00:58:54,359
All right. We got it.
All right. You okay?

966
00:58:54,429 --> 00:58:55,453
Okay.

967
00:58:55,530 --> 00:58:57,555
My brave little man.
All right.

968
00:58:57,632 --> 00:58:58,792
All right.
You okay?

969
00:58:58,867 --> 00:59:00,858
Yeah.
You got the key?

970
00:59:02,571 --> 00:59:04,471
Oh, no.

971
00:59:05,106 --> 00:59:06,630
Wait. Whoa.
Yeah, I got it. I got it.

972
00:59:06,708 --> 00:59:08,767
There it is.
Okay.

973
00:59:08,843 --> 00:59:09,775
All right.

974
00:59:09,844 --> 00:59:12,142
Now, we went to hell and back
to get this thing.

975
00:59:12,214 --> 00:59:13,408
Where's the door out of here?

976
00:59:13,481 --> 00:59:16,143
First, you must find the trunk.

977
00:59:16,218 --> 00:59:17,082
Trunk?

978
00:59:17,152 --> 00:59:18,744
Yes, trunk.

979
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:19,912
Not door?

980
00:59:19,988 --> 00:59:22,786
No. Not door.
Trunk.

981
00:59:22,857 --> 00:59:26,156
All you said I had to do was
find this key! I got the key.

982
00:59:26,228 --> 00:59:28,059
Now you're telling me this story
about a trunk!

983
00:59:28,129 --> 00:59:29,721
The key is the answer to all,
remember?

984
00:59:29,798 --> 00:59:32,733
Look, I don't make the rules.
I just work here.

985
00:59:32,801 --> 00:59:34,735
Okay. That's it.
That's the last straw.

986
00:59:34,803 --> 00:59:36,634
I've had enough
of this nonsense.

987
00:59:36,705 --> 00:59:39,037
Hey, what are you doing?!
Put me down!

988
00:59:39,107 --> 00:59:41,575
This is bad luck!
This is very bad luck!

989
00:59:41,643 --> 00:59:43,770
I'll show you bad luck.
I'm tired of playing around.

990
00:59:43,845 --> 00:59:45,244
I'm getting nauseous!

991
00:59:45,313 --> 00:59:47,144
You'll get over it.

992
00:59:47,816 --> 00:59:49,249
Please don't drop me.

993
00:59:49,317 --> 00:59:51,444
I'm fragile.
I'm very fragile.

994
00:59:51,519 --> 00:59:52,816
Don't talk to me
about being fragile.

995
00:59:52,887 --> 00:59:55,253
I'm the one that's feeling
fragile right now.

996
00:59:58,927 --> 00:59:59,859
Is that it?

997
00:59:59,928 --> 01:00:01,691
- That's it.
- Hmm. All right.

998
01:00:01,763 --> 01:00:03,788
Now we're in business.

999
01:00:04,833 --> 01:00:07,165
Hey, hold her for a second.

1000
01:00:10,105 --> 01:00:12,767
All right.
Okay.

1001
01:00:12,841 --> 01:00:14,604
Okay.

1002
01:00:28,457 --> 01:00:31,221
How do I know what to look for?
This thing is full of junk.

1003
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:34,089
Find the thing that must be read

1004
01:00:34,162 --> 01:00:36,960
lest your heart be filled
with dread.

1005
01:00:37,032 --> 01:00:39,364
There's nothing in here red.

1006
01:00:42,404 --> 01:00:45,066
Hey, wait a minute.
There's a letter here.

1007
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:46,903
It's a letter.

1008
01:00:49,177 --> 01:00:51,702
"Yes, my dear heart,
I will marry you.

1009
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:53,805
I will love you
for all eternity.

1010
01:00:53,882 --> 01:00:56,316
And tonight at last,
we will be together.

1011
01:00:56,384 --> 01:00:57,408
I do.

1012
01:00:57,486 --> 01:01:00,580
Forever yours, Elizabeth."

1013
01:01:00,655 --> 01:01:02,179
She didn't kill herself.

1014
01:01:02,257 --> 01:01:04,225
She wanted to be with him.

1015
01:01:04,292 --> 01:01:06,760
Yeah, and somebody gave him
the wrong letter.

1016
01:01:06,828 --> 01:01:09,353
Yes.
Well done, Mr. Evers.

1017
01:01:09,431 --> 01:01:12,025
I must say I'm impressed.

1018
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:16,002
You are more persistent
than I would have ever imagined.

1019
01:01:16,071 --> 01:01:19,234
The butler did it?
You got to be kidding me.

1020
01:01:19,307 --> 01:01:23,334
I will deal with you two later.

1021
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:26,811
Why'd you kill her?

1022
01:01:26,882 --> 01:01:29,817
Because the master
would not listen to reason.

1023
01:01:29,885 --> 01:01:31,182
He had everything in the world.

1024
01:01:31,253 --> 01:01:35,121
And yet he was willing
to throw it all away for love.

1025
01:01:35,190 --> 01:01:38,785
I did tell him
it would end badly.

1026
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:40,657
You're a real cold dude.

1027
01:01:40,729 --> 01:01:44,165
No, Mr. Evers.
I am a rational man.

1028
01:01:44,232 --> 01:01:46,826
It was my responsibility
to the house.

1029
01:01:46,902 --> 01:01:48,995
My duty, sir, to see to it

1030
01:01:49,070 --> 01:01:53,166
that the boy did not make
a foolish error in judgment.

1031
01:01:53,241 --> 01:01:57,507
Running away with that girl
would have destroyed this house.

1032
01:01:57,579 --> 01:01:59,672
It would have destroyed
everything.

1033
01:01:59,748 --> 01:02:03,411
And I could not stand by
and watch it all fall to ruin.

1034
01:02:03,485 --> 01:02:04,975
Punch his face in, Dad.

1035
01:02:05,053 --> 01:02:07,613
Yeah, but first I'm gonna tell
his master what really happened.

1036
01:02:07,689 --> 01:02:09,486
The master must never know.

1037
01:02:09,558 --> 01:02:12,288
Edward and his love
will be reunited,

1038
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:14,294
and this curse will be broken.

1039
01:02:14,362 --> 01:02:15,829
That's not her.
That's my wife.

1040
01:02:15,897 --> 01:02:18,457
And what she sees in you
I'll never know.

1041
01:02:18,533 --> 01:02:20,967
But that is
of little importance now.

1042
01:02:21,036 --> 01:02:25,302
The only thing that matters is
that the master's pain must end.

1043
01:02:25,373 --> 01:02:27,637
And it will end tonight.

1044
01:02:27,709 --> 01:02:32,146
The curse will be broken,
and we can all finally move on.

1045
01:02:32,213 --> 01:02:34,977
All right. That's it, man.
Where's my wife?

1046
01:02:35,050 --> 01:02:37,075
Getting ready for her wedding,
of course.

1047
01:02:37,152 --> 01:02:38,483
What wedding?
He can't marry her.

1048
01:02:38,553 --> 01:02:39,850
He's dead, and she's not.

1049
01:02:39,921 --> 01:02:41,320
True.

1050
01:02:41,389 --> 01:02:43,823
But that can be
easily corrected.

1051
01:02:43,892 --> 01:02:48,192
Life, I'm afraid,
is such a delicate state.

1052
01:02:48,263 --> 01:02:51,664
If you put one finger on
my wife, I swear I'll kill you.

1053
01:02:54,603 --> 01:02:58,300
How wonderful.
You're going to kill a ghost.

1054
01:02:58,373 --> 01:03:00,568
- Leave him alone!
- Stop it!

1055
01:03:02,177 --> 01:03:03,872
- Aah!
- Aah!

1056
01:03:03,945 --> 01:03:06,038
Let them go!

1057
01:03:09,684 --> 01:03:12,278
You're gonna let my kids out
of here, take me to my wife,

1058
01:03:12,354 --> 01:03:13,878
and let us out of here
right now!

1059
01:03:13,955 --> 01:03:17,789
You want out, fine.

1060
01:03:17,859 --> 01:03:20,794
Let me show you out.

1061
01:03:24,232 --> 01:03:29,363
Now, for the last time,
good night, Mr. Evers.

1062
01:03:31,006 --> 01:03:33,474
Aah!

1063
01:03:33,541 --> 01:03:35,202
Ugh!

1064
01:03:42,651 --> 01:03:44,642
Oh!

1065
01:04:05,674 --> 01:04:07,938
This house has waited so long

1066
01:04:08,009 --> 01:04:11,843
to have its shroud
of darkness lifted.

1067
01:04:11,913 --> 01:04:18,614
And tonight, for the first time
in, oh, so many years,

1068
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:20,450
I believe it may be possible

1069
01:04:20,522 --> 01:04:25,016
that the story will finally end
differently.

1070
01:04:25,093 --> 01:04:26,788
Sara?

1071
01:04:26,861 --> 01:04:30,262
Do you believe that love
is about second chances?

1072
01:04:30,331 --> 01:04:32,765
About forgiveness?

1073
01:04:32,834 --> 01:04:35,530
Yes, I do.

1074
01:04:36,071 --> 01:04:38,062
Don't you remember?

1075
01:04:38,139 --> 01:04:39,606
Remember?

1076
01:04:39,674 --> 01:04:41,141
Mr. Gracey, are you all right?

1077
01:04:41,209 --> 01:04:43,074
Don't you recognize me at all?

1078
01:04:43,144 --> 01:04:44,577
Mr. Gracey.

1079
01:04:44,646 --> 01:04:46,978
I thought certainly bringing you
back to Gracey Manor

1080
01:04:47,048 --> 01:04:48,811
would help you remember.

1081
01:04:48,883 --> 01:04:51,283
Remember what?
Mr. Gracey, you're scaring me.

1082
01:04:51,352 --> 01:04:53,149
Where it happened.

1083
01:04:53,221 --> 01:04:55,314
Where we spent
our last moments together.

1084
01:04:55,390 --> 01:04:58,826
Where we danced together
for the last time before you...

1085
01:04:58,893 --> 01:05:01,327
Before you killed yourself!

1086
01:05:01,396 --> 01:05:02,693
But now you've returned to me.

1087
01:05:02,764 --> 01:05:05,426
And at long last,
we can be together.

1088
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:07,092
Why do you not remember?

1089
01:05:07,168 --> 01:05:09,102
You were my world, my life!

1090
01:05:09,170 --> 01:05:11,832
And I have loved you in death
as I did in life!

1091
01:05:11,906 --> 01:05:13,601
Let me go!

1092
01:05:13,675 --> 01:05:15,836
Why do you not remember?

1093
01:05:17,846 --> 01:05:19,871
You are her.
You are Elizabeth.

1094
01:05:19,948 --> 01:05:21,074
You must be!

1095
01:05:21,149 --> 01:05:23,117
Can you not sense it?
Search your heart.

1096
01:05:23,184 --> 01:05:24,776
I am your one true love.

1097
01:05:24,853 --> 01:05:26,286
And now we can finally
be together.

1098
01:05:26,354 --> 01:05:27,548
Don't you understand?

1099
01:05:28,089 --> 01:05:29,613
Elizabeth,
you must listen to me.

1100
01:05:29,691 --> 01:05:31,124
I'm not Elizabeth!

1101
01:05:31,192 --> 01:05:33,126
Please!
I implore you.

1102
01:05:33,194 --> 01:05:35,719
Leave me alone!
Get away from me!

1103
01:05:41,536 --> 01:05:44,437
She doesn't remember.

1104
01:05:44,506 --> 01:05:45,973
It can't be her.

1105
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:48,304
It is her, sir.

1106
01:05:48,376 --> 01:05:51,641
The gypsy woman
prophesied her return.

1107
01:05:51,713 --> 01:05:54,648
And now the time has come.

1108
01:05:55,383 --> 01:05:56,873
You had best get ready.

1109
01:05:56,951 --> 01:05:58,885
But she doesn't remember.

1110
01:05:58,953 --> 01:06:01,547
In time she will, sir.

1111
01:06:01,623 --> 01:06:04,990
I assure you she will.

1112
01:06:10,198 --> 01:06:13,725
Open up!
Hey!

1113
01:06:13,802 --> 01:06:15,793
Let me in!

1114
01:06:28,783 --> 01:06:30,842
Aah!

1115
01:06:48,069 --> 01:06:50,469
Oh, Ramsley,
you have to help me.

1116
01:06:50,538 --> 01:06:53,302
There's something
horribly wrong. Mr. Gracey...

1117
01:06:53,374 --> 01:06:56,309
Yes. I know, my dear.
I know.

1118
01:06:56,377 --> 01:06:57,969
He's expecting you.

1119
01:06:58,046 --> 01:07:01,777
He's always been expecting you.

1120
01:07:01,850 --> 01:07:04,751
And you haven't put on
your dress yet.

1121
01:07:04,819 --> 01:07:07,344
We can't keep
the master waiting.

1122
01:07:07,422 --> 01:07:09,287
Waiting?
For what?

1123
01:07:09,357 --> 01:07:12,690
Why, your wedding, of course.

1124
01:07:12,727 --> 01:07:13,819
My...

1125
01:07:14,495 --> 01:07:16,429
I'm not Elizabeth!

1126
01:07:16,497 --> 01:07:18,260
Of course you are, my dear.

1127
01:07:18,333 --> 01:07:19,891
You may not see it yet.

1128
01:07:19,968 --> 01:07:22,198
But in time you will.

1129
01:07:22,270 --> 01:07:25,364
You don't actually think I'm
going through with this madness?

1130
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:28,898
Oh, yes.
I very much do.

1131
01:07:28,977 --> 01:07:30,672
You see...

1132
01:07:30,745 --> 01:07:33,737
we wouldn't want anything
to happen to the children.

1133
01:07:33,815 --> 01:07:35,749
Now, would we?

1134
01:07:35,817 --> 01:07:38,115
Michael!
Megan!

1135
01:07:38,186 --> 01:07:39,448
You wouldn't.

1136
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:41,579
Of course not, my dear.

1137
01:07:41,656 --> 01:07:43,783
But that is entirely up to you.

1138
01:07:43,858 --> 01:07:50,388
If not, I really do fear
for the children.

1139
01:07:53,368 --> 01:07:54,960
Have her ready.

1140
01:07:55,036 --> 01:07:58,631
And this time, any further acts
of insubordination

1141
01:07:58,706 --> 01:08:01,573
will be dealt with
in the harshest possible manner.

1142
01:08:01,643 --> 01:08:03,406
But, sir?

1143
01:08:03,478 --> 01:08:06,743
There are worse things
than purgatory, madam.

1144
01:08:06,814 --> 01:08:09,214
I can assure you.

1145
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:14,550
Have her ready.

1146
01:08:57,198 --> 01:09:00,133
Tears of joy.

1147
01:09:24,158 --> 01:09:26,092
What are you doing?

1148
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:28,424
Hey, you leave me alone.

1149
01:09:28,496 --> 01:09:30,157
Just get out of here
and leave me alone.

1150
01:09:30,231 --> 01:09:30,925
Oh, I see.

1151
01:09:30,999 --> 01:09:33,991
You're just gonna sit there,
feeling sorry for yourself.

1152
01:09:34,068 --> 01:09:35,865
You tell me why not.

1153
01:09:35,937 --> 01:09:38,428
This whole thing was my fault.

1154
01:09:38,506 --> 01:09:41,373
We should've never been here
in the first place.

1155
01:09:41,442 --> 01:09:43,103
Supposed to be at the lake.

1156
01:09:43,177 --> 01:09:46,908
We'd be sitting by a warm fire
right now.

1157
01:09:46,981 --> 01:09:49,449
And I made us come here.

1158
01:09:49,517 --> 01:09:52,350
And now it's too late.

1159
01:09:52,420 --> 01:09:55,287
No.
It's never too late.

1160
01:09:55,356 --> 01:09:58,120
Hey, look, I tried to get in
there, and I can't, all right?

1161
01:09:58,192 --> 01:09:59,625
I tried!
I failed!

1162
01:09:59,694 --> 01:10:01,559
You try.
You fail.

1163
01:10:01,629 --> 01:10:03,620
You try.
You fail.

1164
01:10:03,698 --> 01:10:07,361
But the only true failure
is when you stop trying.

1165
01:10:07,435 --> 01:10:10,768
What do you want me to do?
Huh?

1166
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:14,601
Try again.

1167
01:10:20,948 --> 01:10:21,937
Hold on!

1168
01:10:22,016 --> 01:10:24,246
With what?

1169
01:10:30,124 --> 01:10:32,615
- Aah!
- Aah!

1170
01:10:36,297 --> 01:10:37,958
Elizabeth?

1171
01:10:41,636 --> 01:10:44,230
Yes, my love.

1172
01:10:51,079 --> 01:10:52,171
I'll be right back.

1173
01:10:52,246 --> 01:10:55,010
Okay.
I'll wait here.

1174
01:10:57,085 --> 01:10:58,552
Dearly beloved,

1175
01:10:58,586 --> 01:11:01,350
we are gathered together here
in the sight of God

1176
01:11:01,422 --> 01:11:04,858
to join this man and this woman
in the bonds of holy matrimony.

1177
01:11:04,926 --> 01:11:07,759
Dad!
Help us!

1178
01:11:09,864 --> 01:11:12,526
Michael!
Megan!

1179
01:11:15,770 --> 01:11:18,295
Wilt thou, Edward Gracey,

1180
01:11:18,372 --> 01:11:20,840
have this woman to be
thy wedded wife,

1181
01:11:20,908 --> 01:11:23,468
to live together
after God's ordinance

1182
01:11:23,544 --> 01:11:25,705
in the holiest state
of matrimony?

1183
01:11:25,780 --> 01:11:27,008
I will.

1184
01:11:31,018 --> 01:11:34,647
And do you, Elizabeth Henshaw,

1185
01:11:34,722 --> 01:11:37,520
take this man to be
your lawful husband,

1186
01:11:37,592 --> 01:11:43,155
to love and cherish in death
as you did in life?

1187
01:11:43,231 --> 01:11:44,061
I do.

1188
01:11:44,565 --> 01:11:45,998
Whoa!

1189
01:11:52,273 --> 01:11:54,571
Aah!

1190
01:11:54,909 --> 01:11:58,970
From this day forward, you
shall be joined together as one

1191
01:11:59,046 --> 01:12:03,244
for all eternity
until the very end of time.

1192
01:12:10,858 --> 01:12:16,262
What God has joined together
let no man cast asunder.

1193
01:12:19,867 --> 01:12:21,425
- Dad!
- Dad!

1194
01:12:23,771 --> 01:12:26,968
If anyone has any objections...

1195
01:12:28,910 --> 01:12:31,504
Yeah, I got a few objections!

1196
01:12:37,885 --> 01:12:39,682
The next time I say
we're going to the lake,

1197
01:12:39,754 --> 01:12:42,018
- we're going to the lake.
- Let's go.

1198
01:12:43,457 --> 01:12:45,049
Get away from her.

1199
01:12:45,126 --> 01:12:46,650
I lost her once.

1200
01:12:46,727 --> 01:12:48,922
I don't intend
to let it happen again.

1201
01:12:48,996 --> 01:12:51,556
This is not Elizabeth.
Ramsley, you tell him the truth.

1202
01:12:51,632 --> 01:12:54,624
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1203
01:12:54,702 --> 01:12:55,862
Now you got amnesia, huh?

1204
01:12:55,937 --> 01:12:57,996
Elizabeth didn't kill herself.
He did it.

1205
01:12:58,072 --> 01:12:59,596
He's been lying to you
all along.

1206
01:12:59,674 --> 01:13:02,074
I'm warning you, sir.

1207
01:13:02,143 --> 01:13:03,201
Step away.

1208
01:13:03,277 --> 01:13:04,869
Don't think 'cause
you pull out your sword

1209
01:13:04,946 --> 01:13:06,038
I'm gonna let you marry my wife.

1210
01:13:06,113 --> 01:13:08,308
My patience is wearing thin.

1211
01:13:08,382 --> 01:13:10,612
Elizabeth, please, come along.

1212
01:13:10,685 --> 01:13:13,347
I'm not Elizabeth.

1213
01:13:13,421 --> 01:13:14,353
You must be.

1214
01:13:14,422 --> 01:13:16,549
Her name is Sara.
She's from New Jersey.

1215
01:13:16,624 --> 01:13:18,285
Ramsley wants you to think
she's Elizabeth

1216
01:13:18,359 --> 01:13:20,293
so this curse would be lifted.

1217
01:13:20,361 --> 01:13:22,454
That is absurd.

1218
01:13:22,530 --> 01:13:24,122
Forgive me.

1219
01:13:24,198 --> 01:13:25,495
If you're gonna kill me,
kill me.

1220
01:13:25,566 --> 01:13:27,056
But on the other side,

1221
01:13:27,134 --> 01:13:28,897
I'm gonna be whipping your ass
for all eternity.

1222
01:13:28,970 --> 01:13:31,564
So maybe you should read this
before you stab somebody.

1223
01:13:31,639 --> 01:13:33,732
- What is it?
- It's Elizabeth's letter.

1224
01:13:33,808 --> 01:13:35,332
Her real letter.
The one she wrote.

1225
01:13:35,409 --> 01:13:38,037
The one he stole.
You never saw it.

1226
01:13:46,053 --> 01:13:48,317
What's the meaning of this?

1227
01:13:48,389 --> 01:13:52,689
Must we continue to listen
to the ramblings of a lunatic?

1228
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:54,489
But it is written in her hand.

1229
01:13:54,562 --> 01:13:56,996
Yeah, it's written in her hand.
Explain that, Ramsley.

1230
01:13:57,064 --> 01:13:58,827
Well?

1231
01:14:03,170 --> 01:14:06,105
Your union was unacceptable.

1232
01:14:06,173 --> 01:14:10,507
I tried to warn you,
but you wouldn't listen.

1233
01:14:10,578 --> 01:14:12,102
So you killed her.

1234
01:14:12,179 --> 01:14:16,115
I told you it would be a mistake
to run away with that girl.

1235
01:14:16,183 --> 01:14:19,516
But I loved her!
Was love my mistake?

1236
01:14:19,587 --> 01:14:21,214
Yes!

1237
01:14:21,889 --> 01:14:23,823
I tried to protect you.

1238
01:14:23,891 --> 01:14:27,759
All these years
I've sacrificed for you.

1239
01:14:27,828 --> 01:14:32,424
But what would you understand
of sacrifice, duty, or honor?

1240
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:34,468
You loved her.

1241
01:14:34,535 --> 01:14:36,366
Well, damn you.

1242
01:14:36,437 --> 01:14:38,997
Damn you all to hell!

1243
01:14:44,312 --> 01:14:46,473
Aah!

1244
01:15:18,679 --> 01:15:20,670
Aah!

1245
01:15:23,451 --> 01:15:24,247
Aah!

1246
01:15:24,318 --> 01:15:26,411
Jim!

1247
01:15:26,487 --> 01:15:27,715
Aah!

1248
01:15:29,757 --> 01:15:32,191
Aah!

1249
01:15:37,131 --> 01:15:39,031
Aah!

1250
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:01,984
- Mom!
- Mom!

1251
01:16:02,056 --> 01:16:03,080
Mom, what's wrong?

1252
01:16:03,157 --> 01:16:04,283
Are you all right?

1253
01:16:04,358 --> 01:16:05,757
- Mom.
- Hey!

1254
01:16:05,826 --> 01:16:08,158
Hey, Sara.
Sara, what's the matter?

1255
01:16:08,229 --> 01:16:10,322
Sara, what's wrong?

1256
01:16:10,398 --> 01:16:11,956
Hey, what's the matter?
What's wrong?

1257
01:16:12,032 --> 01:16:13,829
It's the poison!

1258
01:16:13,901 --> 01:16:15,095
Oh, no.

1259
01:16:15,169 --> 01:16:17,262
No.
Hey, Sara.

1260
01:16:17,338 --> 01:16:18,771
Come on. Please.
Don't do this!

1261
01:16:18,839 --> 01:16:20,272
Sara, don't do this.
Please.

1262
01:16:20,341 --> 01:16:22,070
Jim...

1263
01:16:23,210 --> 01:16:25,508
Sara! Hey!

1264
01:16:25,579 --> 01:16:27,809
Sara.
Sara, come on. Please.

1265
01:16:27,882 --> 01:16:29,349
Sara.

1266
01:16:29,417 --> 01:16:31,282
Sara, I love you.

1267
01:16:31,352 --> 01:16:34,219
Sara, please.
I love you so much.

1268
01:16:41,362 --> 01:16:43,296
Hey, get away from us!
Leave us alone!

1269
01:16:43,364 --> 01:16:44,456
No, Dad.

1270
01:16:44,532 --> 01:16:46,466
It won't hurt us.

1271
01:17:55,035 --> 01:17:57,595
Elizabeth, is that you?

1272
01:17:57,671 --> 01:18:00,037
Yes, my love.

1273
01:18:00,107 --> 01:18:03,076
The ghost ball was Elizabeth.

1274
01:18:03,143 --> 01:18:06,544
The truth had to be known
for me to be released.

1275
01:18:06,614 --> 01:18:09,174
He saved me.

1276
01:18:10,985 --> 01:18:13,419
It was nothing.

1277
01:18:13,487 --> 01:18:16,012
Oh, Elizabeth.

1278
01:18:16,090 --> 01:18:18,217
Yes, my darling?

1279
01:18:19,260 --> 01:18:23,390
I have waited so long
for this moment.

1280
01:18:23,464 --> 01:18:26,558
And now only heaven awaits.

1281
01:18:37,611 --> 01:18:40,375
He's not really kissing
your mom.

1282
01:18:44,652 --> 01:18:46,176
Hey.

1283
01:18:47,488 --> 01:18:49,353
That's my wife.

1284
01:18:58,032 --> 01:18:59,499
Sara?

1285
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:07,964
Jim?

1286
01:19:08,042 --> 01:19:09,805
I thought I lost you.

1287
01:19:09,877 --> 01:19:11,469
Oh.

1288
01:19:12,246 --> 01:19:14,544
I thought I lost you, too.

1289
01:19:15,583 --> 01:19:17,414
I'm back, Sara.

1290
01:19:17,484 --> 01:19:19,281
I'm back.

1291
01:19:21,989 --> 01:19:23,422
Can you ever forgive me?

1292
01:19:23,490 --> 01:19:27,358
Oh, what's to forgive?
You loved her.

1293
01:19:27,428 --> 01:19:29,919
Here.
Take this.

1294
01:19:30,931 --> 01:19:31,920
What is it?

1295
01:19:31,999 --> 01:19:34,832
The deed to the house.
It's yours.

1296
01:19:34,902 --> 01:19:36,767
Do with it what you will.

1297
01:19:36,837 --> 01:19:38,771
Sell it, keep it.

1298
01:19:38,839 --> 01:19:42,275
Do whatever makes you
and your family happy.

1299
01:19:48,182 --> 01:19:50,082
And thank you.

1300
01:19:51,218 --> 01:19:54,210
Thank you all so much.

1301
01:20:03,931 --> 01:20:05,865
Wait! Wait for us!

1302
01:20:05,933 --> 01:20:08,458
Hold on!

1303
01:20:08,535 --> 01:20:09,797
What's all this?

1304
01:20:09,870 --> 01:20:11,360
Well, I don't know
what we'll need.

1305
01:20:11,438 --> 01:20:13,531
What are you talking about?
We're going to heaven.

1306
01:20:13,607 --> 01:20:14,869
You can't take it with you.

1307
01:20:14,942 --> 01:20:17,308
The hell I can't.

1308
01:20:17,378 --> 01:20:18,367
- Oh.
- Goodbye.

1309
01:20:18,445 --> 01:20:19,810
- Bye-bye.
- Thank you all so much.

1310
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:20,812
You're welcome.

1311
01:20:20,881 --> 01:20:23,145
- Thank you.
- So long, now.

1312
01:20:23,217 --> 01:20:25,481
Okay, little man.
All right. Hurry!

1313
01:20:25,552 --> 01:20:27,042
Let's go!

1314
01:20:27,121 --> 01:20:27,815
- Bye!
- Bye!

1315
01:20:27,888 --> 01:20:30,379
Okay.
Here we go.

1316
01:20:31,992 --> 01:20:33,482
Whoo!

1317
01:20:35,729 --> 01:20:37,287
Bye-bye.

1318
01:20:58,318 --> 01:21:01,344
Angels in heaven
together at last.

1319
01:21:01,422 --> 01:21:04,789
The tale is well ended
for those who have passed.

1320
01:21:04,858 --> 01:21:08,624
Love endures all,
no reason, no rhyme.

1321
01:21:08,695 --> 01:21:12,631
It lasts forever
and forever all time.

1322
01:21:12,699 --> 01:21:14,098
Mom, Leota won't shut up.

1323
01:21:14,167 --> 01:21:16,294
- Are we there yet?
- I'm getting pretty hungry.

1324
01:21:16,369 --> 01:21:17,461
Can we get some pizza?

1325
01:21:17,537 --> 01:21:18,970
How long
before we get there, Sara?

1326
01:21:19,038 --> 01:21:20,403
20 minutes tops.

1327
01:21:20,473 --> 01:21:21,906
Nothing takes 20 minutes.

1328
01:21:21,974 --> 01:21:26,138
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
do, do, do, do, do, do, do

1329
01:21:26,212 --> 01:21:27,804
Hey, guys, keep it down.

1330
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:29,643
- We'll keep it down
- We'll keep it down

1331
01:21:29,716 --> 01:21:31,479
- We'll keep it down
- We'll keep it down

1332
01:21:31,551 --> 01:21:34,987
Oh, yes, we will,
we'll keep it down

1333
01:21:35,054 --> 01:21:38,319
Oh, we're drivin'
down the highway

1334
01:21:38,391 --> 01:21:40,655
Yeah!

1335
01:21:40,727 --> 01:21:47,758
And we're tryin' to
keep it down

1336
01:22:03,683 --> 01:22:06,117

01:22:19,365 --> 01:22:20,798
Iz that your car

1344
01:22:20,867 --> 01:22:22,630
I said yeah,
that's my car, girl

1345
01:22:22,702 --> 01:22:24,329
And if you want to,
you can go

1346
01:22:24,403 --> 01:22:25,836
But let me know
if it's getting too late

1347
01:22:25,905 --> 01:22:27,202
And if not,
I'll catch me another...

I says

1352

Come pick you up to take
you out to lunch or somethin'

01:22:37,884 --> 01:22:39,351
I'll leave it up to you if
I'm gonna touch or somethin'

1354
01:22:39,418 --> 01:22:41,318
You want to cut or somethin',

1355
01:22:41,387 --> 01:22:42,911
We ain't 'bout no game

1356
01:22:42,989 --> 01:22:44,650
Now, when I say we,

Ma, I ain't got no change

1360
01:22:49,562 --> 01:22:51,154
Big space out yours,
like 100 yards

1361
01:22:51,230 --> 01:22:53,323
I got credit cards,
you can charge 'em all, boo

1362
01:22:53,399 --> 01:22:56,334
I know you heard me
on your radio

1363
01:22:56,402 --> 01:22:59,667
Now you're home, right,
trying to steal my crazy flow

1364
01:22:59,739 --> 01:23:02,606
More or less you're biting,
but I'm here to let you know

1365
01:23:02,675 --> 01:23:04,768
It just don't make no sense,
you hating on me

1366
01:23:04,844 --> 01:23:06,277
'Cause what I am,
you trying to be

1367
01:23:06,345 --> 01:23:08,939
And you can find me
on magic dot

1368
01:23:09,015 --> 01:23:11,449
I'm talking N-e,
double "I," dot "y"

1369
01:23:11,517 --> 01:23:13,109
I stop bombs

1370
01:23:13,186 --> 01:23:14,778
What the...
You might as well

1371
01:23:14,854 --> 01:23:16,287
I drop bombs

1372
01:23:16,355 --> 01:23:18,289
Oh, into the heart
of somebody's daughter

1373
01:23:18,357 --> 01:23:19,756
Finally caught her

1374
01:23:19,826 --> 01:23:21,521
Little chicky
like a fish out of water

1375
01:23:21,594 --> 01:23:24,461
She said iz u iz or iz u

But let me know

And if not,

1389
01:23:48,054 --> 01:23:49,817
Now, ladies,

1390
01:23:49,889 --> 01:23:51,481
And bounce with me now

1391
01:23:51,557 --> 01:23:52,990
Fellas,

1392
01:23:53,059 --> 01:23:54,822
And smack a little...
With me now

1393
01:23:54,894 --> 01:23:58,159
Go on, give that girl the eye
and tell her meet u outside

1394
01:23:58,231 --> 01:24:01,496
'Cause we ain't got
nowhere to go

1395
01:24:01,567 --> 01:24:03,762
Yeah, I'll see you
by the curb

1396
01:24:03,836 --> 01:24:05,269
Go on and get your friends,
