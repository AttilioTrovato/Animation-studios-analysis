1
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,711
Is there trouble, kadir?

2
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:17,283
<i>It's mansoor.
He's always trouble.</i>

3
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:19,518
<i>But we paid his bribe.
We'll be all right.</i>

4
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,155
<i>I hope.</i>

5
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:29,999
Neera!

6
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,198
Neera!

7
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:34,334
I was just looking.

8
00:06:08,602 --> 00:06:10,303
I'm not tired, honest.

9
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:12,471
We'll stop in the foothills.

10
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:13,739
It's safer there.

11
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,208
Not much longer.

12
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:17,676
I was dreaming about home.

13
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:20,246
It's so beautiful,
like a palace.

14
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:23,149
Big, grassy fields
for my grandpa's horses.

15
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,552
They're the best
in the whole valley.

16
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:28,120
They win every race.

17
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:29,488
Well, almost every race.

18
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:29,999
Oh, he must be
a very important man --

19
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,390
Oh, he must be
a very important man --

20
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,524
Your grandfather.

21
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:34,493
To breed horses that never lose.

22
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:36,463
To live like a king in a palace.

23
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:39,999
I know he didn't want
to send me away.

24
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,569
But he thought it'd be safer
until after the war.

25
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:46,673
Life has a way of shifting,
like blowing sand.

26
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:53,012
What --
What is it?

27
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:55,582
<i>Kadir, what's wrong?</i>

28
00:06:57,384 --> 00:06:58,684
<i>...mansoor.</i>

29
00:06:58,685 --> 00:06:59,999
Mansoor.

30
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,288
Mansoor.

31
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:08,560
Save yourself, neera.

32
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:10,396
Go west, find the mountains.

33
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:11,530
Follow them home.

34
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:13,999
Don't stop! Don't look back!

35
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,534
Go now! Go!

36
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:16,669
What about you?

37
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,305
Go! Go!

38
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:20,674
Kadir! Hah! Hah!

39
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:35,361
Good boy.

40
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:37,497
<i>Good boy.</i>

41
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:40,333
Wait!

42
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,142
Come back!

43
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:54,714
<i>Come back.</i>

44
00:12:59,412 --> 00:12:59,999
Hey!

45
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,413
Hey!

46
00:13:00,414 --> 00:13:02,514
<i>Where are you going?!</i>

47
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:04,283
<i>Wait for me!</i>

48
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,352
Wait!

49
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:51,731
I'll get you a drink.

50
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:19,485
<i>Black!</i>

51
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,570
Black!

52
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,218
Good boy.

53
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,287
We'll find a way home.

54
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:58,124
You and me. Together.

55
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:57,043
<i>We just have to keep going.</i>

56
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,999
We're close. I think.

57
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,246
We're close. I think.

58
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:02,181
I hope.

59
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:24,669
<i>We're home.</i>

60
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,504
<i>It's there. See?</i>

61
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:28,207
Come on.

62
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:16,521
Ho, boy! Easy now!

63
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:19,057
No! Wait! Come back!

64
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:20,226
Don't leave me!

65
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:24,330
Come back.

66
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,101
<i>Black?</i>

67
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:56,095
<i>Hello?</i>

68
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:58,431
Hello!

69
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:05,137
Hah!

70
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:06,738
Adan?

71
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:09,107
Neera? Is that you?

72
00:20:09,108 --> 00:20:12,010
We thought you were dead.

73
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:14,045
No, it's really me in person.

74
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,381
See?

75
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:17,717
What were you going to do,
chase me away?

76
00:20:19,118 --> 00:20:20,719
I didn't even know it was you.

77
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,188
We heard the caravan
was attacked.

78
00:20:23,189 --> 00:20:25,391
I didn't expect
to ever see you again.

79
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:27,659
Where is everyone?

80
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,160
<i>They ran away.</i>

81
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:29,999
Everyone?

82
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,129
Everyone?

83
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:32,164
Not Ben ishak or me.

84
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,476
Is he all right?

85
00:20:44,477 --> 00:20:47,379
Sometimes, I hear him crying.

86
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:51,217
Go away!

87
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:57,322
<i>Leave me alone! Can't you hear?!</i>

88
00:20:57,323 --> 00:20:58,290
<i>Go!</i>

89
00:20:59,258 --> 00:20:59,999
But... It's me, grandpa.

90
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,761
But... It's me, grandpa.

91
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:10,436
Neera?

92
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:17,375
Oh! Grandpa!

93
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:19,745
Oh, neera.

94
00:21:20,246 --> 00:21:22,714
If he hadn't helped me,
I would have given up.

95
00:21:22,715 --> 00:21:24,649
I just wouldn't have
gotten here.

96
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:29,420
Sometimes in the desert,
the devil plays tricks.

97
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:29,999
Our minds get all twisted,
and we imagine things.

98
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,425
Our minds get all twisted,
and we imagine things.

99
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:36,528
No, he's real! He is!

100
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:38,663
He's already so strong and fast.

101
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:40,231
We have to find him.

102
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:42,167
Neera...

103
00:21:42,168 --> 00:21:45,003
This black colt is just a trick,

104
00:21:45,004 --> 00:21:46,404
a devil dream.

105
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:47,539
He doesn't exist.

106
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,040
Only here.

107
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,475
And here.

108
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:52,645
Let him go.

109
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:01,586
Hyah! Hyah!

110
00:22:01,587 --> 00:22:03,189
Hyah!

111
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,129
Hyah! Hyah!

112
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:19,405
That horse --
The one in front --

113
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:21,506
Isn't that kazeer?

114
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:22,141
Uh-huh.

115
00:22:23,209 --> 00:22:25,211
<i>Kazeer doesn't belong
to us anymore.</i>

116
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:27,746
None of them do.

117
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:29,999
<i>They're scattered.</i>

118
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,482
<i>They're scattered.</i>

119
00:22:30,483 --> 00:22:32,618
<i>Rahmon took kazeer.</i>

120
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:36,421
<i>He took most of the mares.</i>

121
00:22:36,422 --> 00:22:38,057
They were like family.

122
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:39,758
There was no other way.

123
00:22:40,593 --> 00:22:41,726
When the soldiers came

124
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:43,728
with their tanks
and their bombs,

125
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:45,130
they destroyed our fields.

126
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:47,599
Our crops burned to the ground.

127
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,035
There was nothing left. Nothing.

128
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:53,071
I could not afford
to feed them anymore.

129
00:22:53,072 --> 00:22:54,339
I had to sell.

130
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,641
Even jinah?

131
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:59,978
The thought of anyone else
owning jinah --

132
00:22:59,979 --> 00:23:00,000
That cut too deep,
like a jagged knife.

133
00:23:00,001 --> 00:23:02,581
That cut too deep,
like a jagged knife.

134
00:23:03,182 --> 00:23:05,083
<i>So I sent her back
to the desert,</i>

135
00:23:05,084 --> 00:23:06,651
<i>where she belonged.</i>

136
00:23:06,652 --> 00:23:09,120
<i>Some people thought
I was foolish,</i>

137
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:11,190
<i>but I knew it was right.</i>

138
00:23:11,624 --> 00:23:13,992
We are not breeders anymore.

139
00:23:13,993 --> 00:23:15,393
So be it.

140
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,696
At least we have
a roof overhead.

141
00:23:18,297 --> 00:23:20,665
That's luckier than most.

142
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:23,002
We kept abba.

143
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:40,151
Oh!

144
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:42,454
Abba!

145
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:49,721
You remember it?

146
00:24:49,722 --> 00:24:51,190

Need help?

158
00:25:36,502 --> 00:25:38,337
We will manage.

159
00:25:40,139 --> 00:25:43,341
<i>Kazeer looks good,
don't you think?</i>

160
00:25:43,342 --> 00:25:45,110
You should have been
at the races.

161
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,146
He won, of course.

162
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:51,516
<i>Mansoor was too busy thieving his way
through the desert to bring radan.</i>

163
00:25:51,517 --> 00:25:55,086
So it was hardly a challenge.
Nothing even came close.

164
00:25:55,087 --> 00:25:58,256
Still, I appreciate my prizes.

165
00:25:58,257 --> 00:25:59,999
You may recognize some.

166
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,125
You may recognize some.

167
00:26:00,126 --> 00:26:01,325
He won those?!

168
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:03,494
Yeah. It's the new rules.

169
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:06,297
<i>Each tribe stakes
their best mare.</i>

170
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:08,699
<i>The winner gets them all.</i>

171
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:12,103
<i>You are a lucky man, rahmon,
to have won such fine horses.</i>

172
00:26:12,104 --> 00:26:15,106
Your reputation grows
along with your herd.

173
00:26:15,107 --> 00:26:18,376
I hear mansoor caught
your silver mare, jinah.

174
00:26:18,377 --> 00:26:21,612
<i>They say he couldn't catch the
black foal that ran beside her.</i>

175
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:25,149
<i>Perhaps it stumbled
into the secret valley.</i>

176
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,551
<i>You should have kept her.</i>

177
00:26:26,552 --> 00:26:28,619
You would have had a chance.

178
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,999
Instead you have what?

179
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,022
Instead you have what?

180
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:31,457
That one?

181
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:35,026
<i>Do the hopes
of the great Ben ishak</i>

182
00:26:35,027 --> 00:26:36,995
rest with your plough horse?

183
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:43,067
Stop being a hermit, old man.

184
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:44,535
Come to next year's races.

185
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:48,139
See kazeer win again
for the tribe of rahmon.

186
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,540
See you there, huh?

187
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:51,210
<i>Assalamu.</i>

188
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:04,556
Grandpa...

189
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:09,127
<i>Did you hear what he said?</i>

190
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:10,695
It's gotta be him.

191
00:27:10,696 --> 00:27:12,730
My colt --
He's jinah's son.

192
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:15,199
It's gossip, neera. Rumors.

193
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,502
If we find him,
we can start all over.

194
00:27:17,503 --> 00:27:19,070
<i>We can raise a new herd.</i>

195
00:27:19,071 --> 00:27:21,372
<i>We'll have horses again,
just like before.</i>

196
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:23,708
<i>Listen to you.</i>

197
00:27:23,709 --> 00:27:26,077
<i>Such big plans.</i>

198
00:27:26,078 --> 00:27:27,712
<i>You remind me of your mother...</i>

199
00:27:27,713 --> 00:27:29,999
<i>Brave, fearless.</i>

200
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,449
<i>Brave, fearless.</i>

201
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:32,450
<i>She loved her horses.</i>

202
00:27:32,451 --> 00:27:35,520
She could see right
into their hearts.

203
00:27:35,521 --> 00:27:38,589
She rode like
she was born to it.

204
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,459
Better than most of the men.

205
00:30:56,288 --> 00:30:58,223
Whoa!

206
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:15,206
Come on.

207
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:17,709
Good boy. Good boy.

208
00:32:09,561 --> 00:32:11,730
Ben ishak! Ben ishak!

209
00:32:12,164 --> 00:32:13,431
<i>It's neera!</i>

210
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:15,566
<i>She's back, but she --
She's not alone!</i>

211
00:32:15,567 --> 00:32:17,702
Sh-- she -- come quickly!

212
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:22,640
Come on, hurry!

213
00:32:22,641 --> 00:32:26,177
<i>Neera! What are you doing?!</i>

214
00:32:26,178 --> 00:32:27,678
<i>Have you gone mad?</i>

215
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,413
It's him, grandpa!
He's not a dream.

216
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:29,999
He's real!

217
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,548
He's real!

218
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:32,216
And he's fast. Did you see?

219
00:32:32,217 --> 00:32:33,551
You could have been hurt.

220
00:32:33,552 --> 00:32:35,286
No, he wouldn't hurt me.

221
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:36,520
He wouldn't.

222
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:38,422
<i>His heart
is full of fire, neera,</i>

223
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:40,091
like the devil shetan.

224
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:44,261
Whoa!

225
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:45,463
Easy now.

226
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:47,465
He can beat kazeer, grandpa.

227
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:49,400
I know it. He can win.

228
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:51,035
He really can.

229
00:32:51,036 --> 00:32:53,304
<i>Even if he's as good
as you think,</i>

230
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:56,006
<i>even if he's half as good,
the festival's almost here.</i>

231
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:58,209
There's no time to train.
There's no jockey.

232
00:32:58,210 --> 00:32:59,210
<i>There is nothing.</i>

233
00:32:59,211 --> 00:32:59,999
<i>I can ride him.</i>

234
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,479
<i>I can ride him.</i>

235
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,080
<i>He listens to me,
and he'll do it if I ask.</i>

236
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:05,150
He's raw. He's wild.

237
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:09,720
<i>And you -- you're
just a child, a girl.</i>

238
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:11,355
But that's not fair.

239
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:13,524
You know how dangerous
this course is?

240
00:33:13,525 --> 00:33:15,326
I refuse to lose anyone else.

241
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:17,528
<i>Don't even think about it,
understand?</i>

242
00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:19,063
<i>I won't allow it.</i>

243
00:33:19,064 --> 00:33:20,364
I forbid it.

244
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:22,467
I forbid it.

245
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,999
You have to help me, Adan.

246
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,075
You have to help me, Adan.

247
00:33:30,076 --> 00:33:32,076
What?! Are you joking?!

248
00:33:32,077 --> 00:33:34,011
Tell me you're joking.

249
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:37,482
<i>It's our secret now. All right?</i>

250
00:34:12,017 --> 00:34:14,386
Keep him slow
until you get past me!

251
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:16,253
<i>Slow!</i>

252
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:18,123
And wait for my signal,
all right?

253
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:21,258
On mark...

254
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:22,994
Be set...

255
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:25,130
<i>That's not slow!</i>

256
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:29,999
<i>What happened to slow?!</i>

257
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,369
<i>What happened to slow?!</i>

258
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:14,412
Jinah.

259
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,973
Ben ishak!

260
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:56,221
Ben ishak...

261
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,594
Where is he?!

262
00:36:03,595 --> 00:36:05,196
I don't know!

263
00:36:11,603 --> 00:36:13,204
<i>Call him again.</i>

264
00:36:23,615 --> 00:36:25,250
Ho.

265
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:29,999
We better hurry.

266
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,640
We better hurry.

267
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,201
Jinah.

268
00:36:44,669 --> 00:36:46,003
Yes.

269
00:36:46,004 --> 00:36:47,672
Do you remember me?

270
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:56,980
Rahmon! Rahmon! Rahmon!

271
00:36:56,981 --> 00:36:59,249
- Rahmon! Rahmon!
<i>- Mansoor!</i>

272
00:36:59,250 --> 00:36:59,999
Mansoor! Mansoor! Mansoor!

273
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,120
Mansoor! Mansoor! Mansoor!

274
00:37:03,121 --> 00:37:07,459
Mansoor! Mansoor! Mansoor!

275
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:15,766
Control your horse, mansoor!

276
00:37:15,767 --> 00:37:18,103
This is a race, not a fight!

277
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:30,000
<i>Wait! Wait for us!</i>

278
00:37:30,001 --> 00:37:32,483
<i>Wait! Wait for us!</i>

279
00:37:32,484 --> 00:37:34,184
<i>Out of the way!</i>

280
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:35,687
<i>We're coming!</i>

281
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,662
Whoa! Easy.

282
00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:48,198
Steady. Steady.

283
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:51,602
The tribe of Ben ishak humbly
presents its official entry --

284
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:54,004
The stallion shetan.

285
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:56,006
But there's an entrance fee.

286
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:57,407
What do you have to offer --

287
00:37:57,408 --> 00:37:59,277
That broken-down old mare?

288
00:38:00,678 --> 00:38:03,247
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

289
00:38:03,248 --> 00:38:06,617
What if he loses?
Have you thought of that?

290
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:07,985
He won't lose.

291
00:38:07,986 --> 00:38:09,720
Now go on and tell them.

292
00:38:09,721 --> 00:38:12,089
The proud tribe of Ben ishak

293
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:14,658
offers its finest horse
as entry fee...

294
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:17,462
The stallion shetan!

295
00:38:17,996 --> 00:38:20,030
But it's supposed to be
a mare...

296
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:22,099
Not some, uh, devil horse.

297
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:25,603
The finest mare.
That is the rules.

298
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:29,999
Stop whining, rahmon.
Let him race.

299
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,360
Stop whining, rahmon.
Let him race.

300
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:44,189
Tell ishak to say his goodbyes.

301
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:47,325
Good luck.

302
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,417
Easy, easy.

303
00:39:13,418 --> 00:39:14,484
Ahh.

304
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:16,287
Steady now. Steady.

305
00:39:21,392 --> 00:39:23,361
Ho. Ho.

306
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:29,766
Wh-- whoa!

307
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:30,000
Whoa! Steady! Steady!

308
00:39:30,001 --> 00:39:32,002
Whoa! Steady! Steady!

309
00:39:32,003 --> 00:39:33,036
Go! Go! Go!

310
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,073
No!

311
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:52,390
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

312
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:11,108
You can do it, shetan!

313
00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:13,011
Run! Run!

314
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:24,489
Ahhhhh!

315
00:40:26,124 --> 00:40:27,325
Ahhh!

316
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:29,999
Up, shetan! Up!

317
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,029
Up, shetan! Up!

318
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:33,564
Yes!

319
00:40:34,699 --> 00:40:37,135
Good boy!

320
00:41:04,696 --> 00:41:05,629
Ha ha!

321
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:08,165
Hyah! Hyah!

322
00:41:08,166 --> 00:41:10,301
Hyah! Hyah!

323
00:41:17,108 --> 00:41:20,244
Come on, come on! Go! Go!

324
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:32,991
Hyah!

325
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:51,242
Yes! Yes!

326
00:42:18,603 --> 00:42:21,071
Go! Go!

327
00:42:21,072 --> 00:42:23,508
Yes! Yes, shetan, yes!

328
00:42:59,210 --> 00:42:59,999
Yes! Good, shetan!

329
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,111
Yes! Good, shetan!

330
00:43:01,112 --> 00:43:02,513
Good!

331
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:13,423
Come on!

332
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:14,625
Go!

333
00:43:16,694 --> 00:43:19,162
Go!

334
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:20,163
Hyah!

335
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:22,165
Hah! Hah! Hah! Hah!

336
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:23,201
Hah!

337
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:28,005
Get out of my way, mansoor.

338
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:50,026
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

339
00:43:50,027 --> 00:43:52,329
We're gaining on them. Come on!

340
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:54,198
Come on!

341
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,089
Hah! Hah! Hah! Hah!

342
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:34,138
You can do it, shetan!
You can do it!

343
00:44:45,082 --> 00:44:47,551
There's our chance, shetan. Now!

344
00:44:47,552 --> 00:44:50,053
<i>Come on!</i>

345
00:44:50,054 --> 00:44:52,657
Watch out!

346
00:44:53,991 --> 00:44:55,592
Pardon me. Hah!

347
00:44:55,593 --> 00:44:58,228
Hey, no!

348
00:44:58,229 --> 00:44:59,230
No!

349
00:45:14,145 --> 00:45:15,713
Rahmon is leading!

350
00:45:26,991 --> 00:45:29,192
Hyah!

351
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:29,999
Faster, shetan! Faster!

352
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,530
Faster, shetan! Faster!

353
00:45:38,502 --> 00:45:41,973
Go, shetan, go! Go!

354
00:45:52,016 --> 00:45:53,416
Yes! Yes!

355
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:57,555
Yes! Yes! Yes, neera!

356
00:46:02,693 --> 00:46:04,661
Good boy.
You did it. You did it.

357
00:46:04,662 --> 00:46:06,229
You're such a good boy.

358
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:09,432
Shetan! Shetan! Shetan!

359
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:13,036
Shetan! Shetan! Shetan!

360
00:46:13,037 --> 00:46:17,641
Shetan! Shetan! Shetan! Shetan!

361
00:46:17,642 --> 00:46:22,680
Shetan! Shetan! Shetan!

362
00:46:25,716 --> 00:46:28,251
I'm sorry
I disobeyed you, grandpa,

363
00:46:28,252 --> 00:46:29,085
but he won.

364
00:46:29,086 --> 00:46:29,999
He won!

365
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:30,288
He won!

366
00:46:30,289 --> 00:46:32,223
Are you angry?

367
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:39,629
Neera, neera, you did it!

368
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,131
Neera!

369
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:44,134
We did it! We did it!
Ah, you too!

370
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:46,037
We did it!
