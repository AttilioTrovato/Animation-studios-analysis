00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,852
The queen has already
indicated that Princess Mia

170
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:30,482
intends to learn more at her side
before assuming the throne.

171
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:35,445
It was not Princess Mia
to whom I was referring.

172
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,302
Oh, wow.

173
00:12:03,015 --> 00:12:04,933
King Chevalier

174
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:10,272
was the great-great-great-grandfather of...

175
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:11,899
Hello?

176
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:14,067
Ah... Oh.

177
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:16,486
(CLEARS THROAT)

178
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:18,988
Proceed.

179
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:22,783
(GASPS)

180
00:12:28,499 --> 00:12:29,541
Nice.

181
00:12:34,922 --> 00:12:35,922
Hello?

182
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:55,609
MABREY: <i>So.</i>

183
00:12:56,235 --> 00:12:59,530
As of the 20th of October last year,

184
00:13:00,197 --> 00:13:04,910
on the occasion of his 21st birthday,

185
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:11,291
another Genovian of the royal bloodline
became eligible to assume the throne.

186
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:12,708
What?

187
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:15,504
My nephew, Lord Devereaux.

188
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,589
I beg your pardon?

189
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:21,844
My nephew's mother was my wife's sister.

190
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:26,557
Therefore, Your Majesty,
I am pleased to say

191
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:29,685
that my nephew
is ready to take his place

192
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:33,021
as Genovia's rightful king.

193
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:37,901
Shut up.

194
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:40,362
I beg your pardon?

195
00:13:40,696 --> 00:13:45,701
- I mean...
- "Shut up" doesn't always mean shut up.

196
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:47,410
<i>"Taisez-vous" veut dire...</i>

197
00:13:47,411 --> 00:13:50,371
In America, it's like
"Oh, my," "Gee whiz," "Wow."

198
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:52,308
<i>- "Fantastique," "Superbe," "Oy vey."
- Yeah, thank you, Mr. Prime Minister.</i>

199
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:55,668
But isn't Princess Mia
first in line to ascend the throne?

200
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:56,669
Not yet.

201
00:13:57,171 --> 00:14:01,007
Genovian law states
that a princess must marry

202
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:03,551
before she can take the throne.

203
00:14:03,552 --> 00:14:06,096
<i>CLARISSE: We have never
enforced that law.</i>

204
00:14:06,305 --> 00:14:09,182
A man doesn't have to marry to be king.

205
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:12,143
I mean, this is the 21st century,
for heaven's sake.

206
00:14:12,144 --> 00:14:16,189
My granddaughter should
be given the same rights as any man.

207
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,274
Yeah!

208
00:14:22,112 --> 00:14:27,868
Genovia shall have no queen
lest she be bound in matrimony.

209
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:30,662
Lord Palimore?

210
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:35,375
That is the law of Genovia
for the last 300 years.

211
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:40,339
Princess Mia is not qualified to rule
because she is unmarried.

212
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:42,424
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

213
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:46,136
Not all of us are sure that the princess

214
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:52,059
is the most suitable choice
to govern our great nation.

215
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:53,809
(ALL) <i>Ooh!</i>

216
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,520
Now, now, gentlemen, gentlemen. Please.

217
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:59,065
I suggest this honored body

218
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:01,818
allow Princess Mia one year,

219
00:15:02,194 --> 00:15:04,320
during which time she must marry,

220
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:09,075
or she forfeits the throne
of Genovia to young Lord Devereaux.

221
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:10,201
What? No.

222
00:15:10,202 --> 00:15:13,330
- I object. I object most strongly.
- One year?

223
00:15:13,831 --> 00:15:14,872
- 60 days.
- Two months.

224
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:16,207
60 days?

225
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,543
30 days.

226
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:23,674
How could parliament expect me
to fall in love in 30 days? It's like...

227
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:27,386
It's like it's a big trick to get me
to have an arranged marriage, or...

228
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:30,138
No.

229
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:33,621
No, there's no...
That's it, there's no "or." There's... I...

230
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:35,727
An arranged marriage is my only choice.

231
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:40,148
What kind of person
agrees to an arranged marriage?

232
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:43,651
Uh...

233
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:46,697
You agreed to an arranged marriage.

234
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:49,741
- Right.
- Yes, I did.

235
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:53,579
And it turned out quite splendidly.

236
00:15:54,246 --> 00:15:59,251
He was my best friend.
We grew very fond of each other.

237
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,628
I'm sure, Grandma, but...

238
00:16:02,296 --> 00:16:06,133
I dream of love, not fondness.

239
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:10,053
But you don't have to do this, Mia.
You don't have to become queen.

240
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:15,976
This is so unfair.

241
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:24,109
(MAN'S VOICE) <i>Amelia.</i>

(BOTH)
<i>Courage is not the absence of fear,</i>

243

that something else is more important...</i>

244
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:36,329

There are 550 years

And I will be up there
next to my father.

247
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:55,349
I'm sure I want my chance
to make a difference as a ruler.

248
00:16:57,226 --> 00:17:00,020
Spoken like a true queen.

249
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:09,238
You, my boy, a true-born Genovian.

250
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:11,156
You should be our king.

251
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:13,866
I agree.

252
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:17,913
But how can we make it happen?

253
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:20,874
Give me one of your arrows.

254
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:24,586
I'm going to show you a trick that
I learned from an old Italian philosopher.

255
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:26,255
Niccolò Machiavelli.

256
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:32,636
I can make this dart
hit the bull's-eye every time.

(YELLS)

258
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:41,436
Yes, but that is cheating.

259
00:17:41,687 --> 00:17:42,687
You've got it.

260
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:48,734
Lord Devereaux will be arriving shortly,
Mrs. Kout, with his snake of an uncle.

261
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:49,736
Yes, Your Majesty.

262
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:52,697
- Your Majesty.
- Hm?

263
00:17:52,698 --> 00:17:56,868
I know Lionel is the prime minister's
nephew and he's interning for the summer

264
00:17:56,869 --> 00:17:58,509
because he wants to learn about security.

265
00:17:59,371 --> 00:18:03,375
But he never leaves my side.
He sticks to me like Velcro, madam.

266
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:06,961
It won't last very long.
He returns to school in the autumn.

267
00:18:06,962 --> 00:18:09,297
- He wants an audience with you.
- What, now?

268
00:18:09,298 --> 00:18:10,298
Now.

269
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:12,508
Lionel?

270
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:15,469
Short.

271

I don't know if you've met
Mrs. Kout, our housekeeper,

272
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:22,769
and Priscilla and Olivia, my lady's maids.

273
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:25,372
I'm doing a background check on Olivia.

274
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:28,482
Oh, that's not necessary, Lionel.

275
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:31,945
Everybody in this room
has high-priority clearance.

276
00:18:32,154 --> 00:18:33,197
Of course, of course.

- Hm?

want to fetch me my tea.

- Of course. Lionel.
- Oh, hello.

285
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:06,854
So is this all right to welcome
the viscount and his nephew?

286
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:08,649
Very appropriate. And pretty.

287
00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:12,652
Oh, I can't believe
parliament invited the guy

288
00:19:12,653 --> 00:19:15,405
who's trying to steal the throne
to stay here with us at the palace.

289
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:17,366
Oh, no, parliament didn't invite him.

290
00:19:17,658 --> 00:19:18,659
I did.

291
00:19:19,827 --> 00:19:20,827
Wha...

292
00:19:21,286 --> 00:19:23,996
I offered to have him
hung by his toes in our courtyard.

293
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:27,042
- Excuse me.
- Yeah, what about Joe's suggestion, huh?

294
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:33,090
No. If there's any mischief going on,
I'd prefer it be right under my nose.

- Hello, I'm here to welcome you.
- Your staff is incompetent and unreliable.

298
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:51,066
I just so don't want
to be nice to this guy, you know?

he's arrogant, self-centered, he's...

Ah, well, have you met him?

301
00:19:55,863 --> 00:19:59,032
- No.
- Neither have I.

302
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:01,577
Yeah, but he probably is, Grandma.
I mean...

303
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:06,123
Like, now, all of a sudden, out of nowhere,
he wants to be the king of Genovia?

304
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:09,626
- What is that about?
- Oh, tush.

305
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,587
Whatever he is, we will be charm itself.

306

329
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:47,266
Yep. At the ball. Didn't know
who he was, so, you know, we...

330
00:21:47,641 --> 00:21:50,853
We danced, and I flirted.

I feel so stupid right now.

00:22:18,255 --> 00:22:21,592
The renovations for your suite
are finally finished.

340
00:22:21,842 --> 00:22:23,969
Should have been ready for you
when you arrived,

341
00:22:24,219 --> 00:22:29,266
but unfortunately we asked
Rupert's cousin to do the bathroom.

342
00:22:29,474 --> 00:22:34,021
It's a good lesson. Nepotism
belongs in the arts, not in plumbing.

343
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:41,820
This is your very own suite.

344
00:22:42,362 --> 00:22:44,781
- Are you serious? This is...
- Mm-hm.

346
00:22:49,703 --> 00:22:52,623
- This is my room?
- Yes.

347
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,500
Oh, Grandma.

348
00:22:55,751 --> 00:22:58,837
This is very nice.

349
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:00,087
Good.

350
00:23:07,846 --> 00:23:09,223
We just made the bed.

351
00:23:09,515 --> 00:23:12,518
This is so cool.

352
00:23:12,893 --> 00:23:17,856
CLARISSE: <i>Ah, Fat Louie. I think
he rather likes his new abode as well.</i>

353
00:23:18,899 --> 00:23:20,234
There's more.

354
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,165
- Is that mine?
- Why don't you go and find out?

355
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:36,916
OK.

356
00:23:37,626 --> 00:23:39,211
I have my own mall.

357
00:23:42,673 --> 00:23:45,384
Ooh, very nice shoes.

358
00:23:46,051 --> 00:23:49,804
CLARISSE: <i>I'm glad you like it.
Try pressing button number three.</i>

359
00:23:49,805 --> 00:23:50,805
Oh.

360
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:58,897
They're charming. I love these.

361
00:23:59,815 --> 00:24:01,607
What do you think? Grandma?

362
00:24:01,608 --> 00:24:02,985
I'm here.

363
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:06,196
Oh, hello. Ooh, love that.

364
00:24:06,572 --> 00:24:10,284
- This is...
- Now press combination 656.

365
00:24:10,868 --> 00:24:12,661
656.

366
00:24:18,709 --> 00:24:25,131
Um... They're a little... gorgeous.

367

CLARISSE: <i>I had a selection
of the crown jewels brought out for you.</i>

368
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:34,308
They're yours to borrow, with great
discretion, at appropriate times.

369
00:24:34,808 --> 00:24:38,437
Now for the best surprise of all.

370
00:24:42,858 --> 00:24:43,901
Wow.

371
00:24:45,777 --> 00:24:50,157
Gorgeous, Grandma. But kind of a letdown
after the jewels, I'm not gonna lie...

372
00:24:50,449 --> 00:24:51,449
(SCREAMS)

373
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:57,705

374
00:24:57,706 --> 00:25:01,210

- I know I'm here.

- You're in Genovia.
- I know.

376
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:04,420
- You're in my closet.
- Yeah.

377
00:25:04,421 --> 00:25:06,006
- You're blonde.
- I'm blonde.

378
00:25:06,256 --> 00:25:07,633
I'm so glad to see you.

379
00:25:07,925 --> 00:25:10,635
I think this is
as good a moment as any to bow out.

380
00:25:10,636 --> 00:25:12,876
I think I'll let you two ladies
catch up with each other.

381

MIA: <i>I can't believe you're here.
When did your flight get in?</i>

382
00:25:15,474 --> 00:25:16,641
- Just a little while ago.
- Oh.

383
00:25:16,642 --> 00:25:19,186
By the way... I'm getting married.

384
00:25:19,394 --> 00:25:21,230
- To who?
- I don't know.

385
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:24,775
CHARLOTTE: <i>Baron Johann Klimt.</i>

386
00:25:25,192 --> 00:25:27,473

He's a compulsive gambler.</i>

(MIA GASPS)

388
00:25:30,656 --> 00:25:34,493
Yes. Oh, yes,
I, I, I, I absolutely accept.

389
00:25:35,244 --> 00:25:40,374
Prince William. He's not eligible,
because he's in line for his own crown.

390
00:25:40,666 --> 00:25:41,708
Oh.

391
00:25:41,959 --> 00:25:45,087
If he's not eligible,
why is he included in these pictures?

392
00:25:45,462 --> 00:25:49,383
- I just love to look at him.
- Mm. Me too. Mm-mm.

393
00:25:49,967 --> 00:25:51,635
- Your Majesty.
- Next.

394
00:25:51,927 --> 00:25:55,054
- CHARLOTTE: <i>Antoine Suisson of Paris.
- Uh-huh.</i>

395
00:25:55,055 --> 00:25:58,015
Plays the harp. No title, but good family.

396
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:00,352
- What about the title "husband"?
- Yeah, he's cute.

397
00:26:00,561 --> 00:26:02,687
Mm. His boyfriend
thinks he's handsome also.

398
00:26:02,688 --> 00:26:03,814
Right on.

399
00:26:04,481 --> 00:26:08,026
No matter. Put him on all the
invitation lists. He's a divine dancer.

400
00:26:08,235 --> 00:26:09,235
CHARLOTTE: <i>Next.</i>

401

CLARISSE: <i>Too old.</i>

402
00:26:10,946 --> 00:26:12,573
Too young.

403
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,826
- Does this popcorn taste like pears?
- Mm. Genovian specialty.

404
00:26:16,827 --> 00:26:19,121
- JOE: <i>Arrested too many times.
- Wait, no.</i>

405
00:26:19,329 --> 00:26:20,330
We need someone titled,

406
00:26:20,706 --> 00:26:25,711
someone who can help you run a country
without ego getting in the way.

407
00:26:25,961 --> 00:26:30,007
Someone attractive, smart,
but not arrogant.

408
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:33,719
Someone with compassion.

409
00:26:33,927 --> 00:26:35,679
Someone like him?

410
00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:39,725
Yes. Someone very much like him.

411
00:26:39,975 --> 00:26:43,145
Good choice, Mia.
I wonder I didn't think of him before.

412
00:26:43,395 --> 00:26:46,064
- Andrew Jacoby.
- Duke of Kenilworth.

413
00:26:46,089 --> 00:26:47,089
Aw.

414
00:26:47,144 --> 00:26:49,604
Well, he looks... decent.

415
00:26:51,195 --> 00:26:55,824
CHARLOTTE: <i>He was an Olympic swimmer,
rides motorcycles, loves photography,</i>

416
00:26:56,074 --> 00:26:58,702
<i>and he's a pilot in the Royal Air Force.</i>

417
00:27:03,165 --> 00:27:04,917
- Can I do that?
- No.

418
00:27:06,251 --> 00:27:07,961
- You ever take those shades off?
- No.

419

ELSIE: <i>Here we are
at the breezy seashore village of Mertz.</i>

420
00:27:13,509 --> 00:27:17,221
And our two lovers have perfect weather
for their first public outing.

421
00:27:17,554 --> 00:27:20,807
Along with Andrew's parents,
Susan and Arnold.

422
00:27:21,517 --> 00:27:24,478
Must be rather hard
to get to know each other this way.

423
00:27:24,811 --> 00:27:28,690
Oh, they're waving at us.

424

- My... Oh.
- Oh, wait, wait, wait.

425
00:27:32,361 --> 00:27:35,155
Wait, Mia. A princess
should not run for a scarf.

426
00:27:35,447 --> 00:27:36,698
I got it.

427
00:27:37,533 --> 00:27:41,787
Shall we have some tea?

428
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:44,413
- Your scarf, ma'am.
- Why, thank you, sir.

429

No, no, let them bond. Let them bond.

433

- The glasses. Off.
- I'm coming, Princess.

nestled under Genovia's famous pear tree.

454
00:29:12,127 --> 00:29:14,939
- And I have something for you.
- Oh, you don't have to get me anything.

455
00:29:14,963 --> 00:29:18,090
- No, my birthday was last week, and...
- Mia. Here you go.

00:29:18,091 --> 00:29:22,638
Cool. You know, film. That's nice.
It's... What is that? Is that...

457
00:29:22,846 --> 00:29:25,390
It's a film canister.

458
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:28,060
What's in the film canister? What's in it?

459
00:29:28,685 --> 00:29:31,355
- Why don't you open it? You'll see.
- Oh, OK.

460
00:29:31,688 --> 00:29:32,688
Oh.

461
00:29:38,111 --> 00:29:41,073
It was my great-grandmother's
engagement ring.

462
00:29:41,281 --> 00:29:43,951
She and my great-grandfather
were married for 57 years.

463
00:29:44,535 --> 00:29:45,535
So I...

464
00:29:46,036 --> 00:29:48,038
I felt it could be lucky for us, maybe.

465
00:29:48,956 --> 00:29:54,670
- Do I have to put it on myself?
- No, I could do that.

- OK.
- Yes.

467

Princess Mia has managed
to find a husband within a week.

476
00:31:01,445 --> 00:31:05,657
Mia cannot possibly be happy
with the idea of an arranged marriage.

Your task is to romance her.

478

a real relationship could be like.

with heat and passion.

- And change her mind about Andrew.
- Exactly.

481

and the throne is ours.

It was his dearest wish.

His last words to me were:

485
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:38,357
"Help him, Arthur.
One day he could be king."

486
00:31:39,525 --> 00:31:42,194
I don't recall him
ever mentioning that to me.

487
00:31:42,444 --> 00:31:44,844
Well, you wouldn't.
You were only six years old when he died.

488
00:31:44,988 --> 00:31:47,366
But you do remember
who he named you after, don't you?

489
00:31:47,574 --> 00:31:48,909
Yes. Grandfather Nicholas.

490
00:31:49,201 --> 00:31:51,703
No, no, no, no. Niccolò Machiavelli.

- No.

00:32:38,709 --> 00:32:41,545
Actually, on the contrary.
I was just admiring my ring.

Well, if you'll excuse me, I really
must go see to some wedding details.

507
00:32:55,434 --> 00:32:59,479
I'm sorry, is there something
you wanted to say to me?

508
00:33:00,105 --> 00:33:01,148
No, no.

509
00:33:01,398 --> 00:33:04,067
You are the one
who stomped on me with your big feet.

510
00:33:04,401 --> 00:33:05,819
Big feet?

511
00:33:06,612 --> 00:33:08,155
Brigitte, I found her.

512
00:33:08,739 --> 00:33:10,032
Uh, Brigitta.

513
00:33:10,365 --> 00:33:12,326
(WHISPERS) <i>I'm not here.</i>

514
00:33:12,784 --> 00:33:16,121
It wasn't her. It was a ghost. Whoo...

515
00:33:16,538 --> 00:33:19,124
Well, you know,
you danced with my big feet.

516
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:23,128
Fine. I danced with you. Call The Hague,
convene the war-crimes tribunal.

517
00:33:23,462 --> 00:33:26,256
Mia, I would remind you
that we only danced for about a minute.

518
00:33:26,715 --> 00:33:29,801
It was more than a minute.

519
00:33:30,219 --> 00:33:32,095
Well, maybe a minute and a half.

520
00:33:32,846 --> 00:33:37,225
Fine. It was a minute and a half,
but it was also a lie,

521
00:33:37,226 --> 00:33:40,687
because you didn't tell me who you were
and that you were trying to steal my crown.

522
00:33:40,896 --> 00:33:43,815
Please pardon me, I just had
a momentary lapse of good manners.

523
00:33:44,024 --> 00:33:47,735
You see, usually, when I ask a woman
to dance, I always show her my family tree.

524
00:33:47,736 --> 00:33:49,696
Oh. Well, aren't you just...

525
00:33:50,489 --> 00:33:51,323
crafty.

526
00:33:51,324 --> 00:33:52,782
- MRS KOUT: <i>Let's look in the ballroom.</i>
- BRIGITTA: <i>The ballroom?</i>

527
00:33:52,783 --> 00:33:54,583
- I don't think she's in the ballroom.
- Well.

528
00:33:55,452 --> 00:33:57,036
Do you want to know
what else you were doing,

529
00:33:57,037 --> 00:33:58,757
while you were doing your little lie dance?

530
00:33:58,791 --> 00:34:00,726
<i>- Lie dance?</i>
- BRIGITTA: <i>The ballroom?</i>

531
00:34:00,833 --> 00:34:02,644
- Yeah, that is exactly what you did.
- What is a lie dance?

532
00:34:02,668 --> 00:34:04,586
MRS KOUT: <i>I'll go look
in the ballroom myself.</i>

533
00:34:04,962 --> 00:34:06,088
BRIGITTA: <i>All right.</i>

534
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:12,302
The lie dance is not the point.

535
00:34:12,553 --> 00:34:14,471
- The point is that...
- What is the point?

536
00:34:14,721 --> 00:34:15,721
I...

537
00:34:16,014 --> 00:34:21,224
The point is that I'm onto you. Oh boy,
am I onto what you are trying to do.

538
00:34:21,249 --> 00:34:22,347
And what am I trying to do?

539
00:34:22,372 --> 00:34:24,255
I think we both know
exactly what that is.

540
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,712
Oh, oh.

541
00:34:25,737 --> 00:34:28,526
Please forgive the intrusion,
Your Highness, Lord Devereaux.

542
00:34:28,527 --> 00:34:29,695
No, you don't... Uh...

543
00:34:31,905 --> 00:34:34,783
JOE: <i>I'm told this Lord Devereaux boy
is a native Genovian.</i>

Recently graduated Cambridge,
gourmet cook,

545
00:34:37,286 --> 00:34:40,746
plays polo and rugby,
and is known as quite a ladies' man.

546
00:34:40,747 --> 00:34:45,544
- She was in a closet?
- With him. Yes.

547
00:34:46,003 --> 00:34:49,173
Does she have the makings of a queen?

548
00:34:49,548 --> 00:34:51,800
Well, she's young,
but I've always believed in her.

549
00:34:52,176 --> 00:34:54,219
The wedding invitations
have been sent out.

550
00:34:54,553 --> 00:34:57,139
- She and Andrew make a fine pair, I think.
- Yes, they do.

551
00:34:57,598 --> 00:34:59,433
She's very set on it, you know.

552
00:35:00,184 --> 00:35:02,853
Clarisse, my dear.
Forget the wedding for a moment.

553

(CLEARS THROAT)

554
00:35:06,648 --> 00:35:09,317
In less than a month,
you will no longer be queen,

555
00:35:09,318 --> 00:35:12,196
and I will no longer
be your head of security.

556
00:35:13,363 --> 00:35:17,242
I think it's time we bring
our friendship out of the shadows.

557
00:35:17,743 --> 00:35:20,913
- Oh, Joseph, I...
- Yes.

558
00:35:21,246 --> 00:35:24,416
Yes, my dear. I would kneel
if it weren't for my knee replacement.

559
00:35:24,875 --> 00:35:28,962
Joseph, there's a wedding to be planned.

560
00:35:29,296 --> 00:35:34,426
Mia needs to win over the people
of Genovia, all in less than 30 days.

561
00:35:34,635 --> 00:35:37,888
Perhaps it's time to consider
the duty you have to yourself.

562
00:35:40,015 --> 00:35:41,015
Oh.

563
00:35:41,558 --> 00:35:42,558
Clarisse...

564
00:35:43,435 --> 00:35:47,231
My darling, please think about it. Please.

565
00:35:49,191 --> 00:35:50,191

Well, my uncle feels that
Princess Mia doesn't know the people.

she's spent little time here since then.

I think she rocks at it.

1510
01:34:29,378 --> 01:34:32,713
So as the granddaughter
of Queen Clarisse and King Rupert...

1511
01:34:32,714 --> 01:34:35,509
(ALL) <i>King Rupert. May he rest in peace.</i>

1512
01:34:36,593 --> 01:34:40,722
I ask the members of parliament
to think about your daughters,

1513
01:34:42,182 --> 01:34:45,893
your nieces, and sisters,
and granddaughters,

1514
01:34:45,894 --> 01:34:47,104
AND ASK YOURSELVES:

1515
01:34:49,314 --> 01:34:52,693
Would you force them to do
what you're trying to make me do?

1516
01:34:56,488 --> 01:34:59,616
I believe I will be a great queen.

1517
01:35:00,325 --> 01:35:04,204
<i>I understand Genovia to be a land
that combines the beauty of the past</i>

1518
01:35:05,038 --> 01:35:07,206
<i>with all the best hope of the future.</i>

1519
01:35:07,207 --> 01:35:08,667
- Not now.
- Shh.

1520
01:35:09,334 --> 01:35:13,547
I feel in my heart and soul
that I can rule Genovia.

1521
01:35:13,839 --> 01:35:15,632
I... I love Genovia.

1522
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:19,511
Do you think that I would
be up here in a wedding dress if I didn't?

1523
01:35:22,014 --> 01:35:23,056
I stand here,

1524
01:35:24,308 --> 01:35:27,853
ready to take my place as your queen.

1525
01:35:29,104 --> 01:35:31,982
Without a husband.

1526
01:35:32,691 --> 01:35:35,694
WOMAN: <i>Viva Mia!</i>

1527
01:35:42,242 --> 01:35:43,535
Every time...

1528
01:35:44,661 --> 01:35:49,249
Every time this charming
young lady opens her mouth,

1529
01:35:49,708 --> 01:35:54,588
she demonstrates a contempt
for the customs of Genovia.

1530
01:35:55,506 --> 01:36:01,720
The law clearly states
an unmarried woman cannot be queen.

1531
01:36:02,805 --> 01:36:03,806
Fortunately,

1532
01:36:05,349 --> 01:36:07,810
there is another heir.

1533
01:36:08,143 --> 01:36:09,394
No, there is not.

1534
01:36:11,855 --> 01:36:14,608
I decline. I refuse to be king.

1535
01:36:16,443 --> 01:36:20,113
Ladies and gentlemen, it is Princess Mia
who should have the crown.

1536
01:36:21,198 --> 01:36:23,617
She's bright, and she is caring.

1537
01:36:24,284 --> 01:36:26,453
But more importantly, she has a vision.

1538
01:36:27,162 --> 01:36:30,624
One that will take Genovia forward,
and if the parliament were astute,

1539
01:36:31,875 --> 01:36:33,335
they would name her queen.

1540
01:36:34,086 --> 01:36:37,631
Listen to her.
She'll lead us into the 21st century.

1541
01:36:38,757 --> 01:36:43,554
And besides, just think how lovely
she'll look on our postage stamp.

1542
01:36:45,639 --> 01:36:47,891
Lovely on a postage stamp?

1543
01:36:48,559 --> 01:36:50,935
You would look lovely on a postage stamp!

1544
01:36:50,936 --> 01:36:54,731
Don't you walk away from me, sir!
You have a duty, sir, to Genovia.

1545
01:36:55,149 --> 01:36:59,945
He's, uh... he is very distressed.

1546
01:37:00,195 --> 01:37:02,447
Your duty, sir, to the country! To me, sir!

1547
01:37:04,783 --> 01:37:08,328
To Genovia! For your father! Nicholas!

1548
01:37:08,829 --> 01:37:11,290
- The door.
- Shut the doors, quickly.

1549
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:14,126
Nicholas. Nicholas!

1550
01:37:14,793 --> 01:37:18,171
Nicholas, I cannot have you
giving all, all this up just for a girl.

1551
01:37:18,172 --> 01:37:20,382
- Now, look, we can still...
- Enough, Uncle.

1552
01:37:21,717 --> 01:37:22,717
We're finished.

1553
01:37:25,554 --> 01:37:26,930
What is happening here?

1554
01:37:27,431 --> 01:37:29,974
Who's next in line for the throne?
The Von Trokens?

1555
01:37:29,975 --> 01:37:31,392
We accept.

1556
01:37:31,393 --> 01:37:33,604
Sit down.

1557
01:37:37,608 --> 01:37:39,193
<i>(COUGHS) Make a motion.</i>

1558
01:37:39,526 --> 01:37:42,028
<i>- Are you OK? Do you need a...
- (COUGHS) Make a motion.</i>

1559
01:37:42,029 --> 01:37:42,863
Ah.

1560
01:37:42,864 --> 01:37:46,241
- Prime Minister?
- Yes, Princess?

1561
01:37:47,576 --> 01:37:49,869
I move to abolish the marriage law,

1562
01:37:49,870 --> 01:37:54,291
as it applies to present
and future queens of Genovia.

1563
01:37:54,833 --> 01:37:56,794
Will anyone second my motion?

1564
01:38:00,172 --> 01:38:02,841
Keep eye contact with them.
Stare them down.

1565
01:38:03,884 --> 01:38:06,719
No, not, not... Soften. Soften.

1566
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:07,971
Good.

1567
01:38:13,268 --> 01:38:17,481
I second the motion.

1568
01:38:20,067 --> 01:38:22,694
It's time we had a new tradition.
I like change.

1569
01:38:23,070 --> 01:38:24,488
I may grow a mustache.

1570
01:38:24,822 --> 01:38:26,489
I think you'd look marvelous
with a mustache.

1571
01:38:26,490 --> 01:38:28,449
You know, my father
always favored a Van Dyke...

1572
01:38:28,450 --> 01:38:29,618
Gentlemen, gentlemen. Please.

1573
01:38:30,661 --> 01:38:36,375
All those in favor of abolishing
the marriage rule, say, "Aye."

1574
01:38:39,503 --> 01:38:40,503
Aye.

1575
01:38:42,131 --> 01:38:43,131
Aye.

1576
01:38:43,590 --> 01:38:45,384
- Aye.
- Aye.

1577
01:38:45,843 --> 01:38:48,803
- You're not in parliament. Sit down.
- Someday.

1578
01:38:48,804 --> 01:38:50,430
(ALL) <i>Aye.</i>

1579
01:38:51,473 --> 01:38:53,142
The ayes have it.

1580
01:38:53,684 --> 01:38:56,353
Congratulations, Princess.

1581
01:38:56,603 --> 01:38:58,355
If I may say so myself,

1582
01:38:58,814 --> 01:39:00,107
you rule!

1583
01:39:10,742 --> 01:39:11,742
Lionel.

1584
01:39:13,954 --> 01:39:15,038
Your Majesty?

1585
01:39:16,206 --> 01:39:17,082
Hm?

1586
01:39:17,083 --> 01:39:18,584
The princess would like a word.

1587
01:39:19,501 --> 01:39:20,752
Oh. Erm...

1588
01:39:24,715 --> 01:39:27,134
Grandma?

1589
01:39:27,885 --> 01:39:31,472
Just because I didn't
get my fairy-tale ending,

1590
01:39:32,097 --> 01:39:33,432
doesn't mean you shouldn't.

1591
01:39:35,893 --> 01:39:36,894
Oh, uh...

1592
01:39:37,311 --> 01:39:41,565
- Did you hear that?
- Not if you didn't want me to.

1593
01:39:41,982 --> 01:39:43,775
Oh, Charlotte.

1594
01:39:44,693 --> 01:39:46,028
Well.

1595
01:39:57,122 --> 01:39:58,122
Joseph?

1596
01:39:59,416 --> 01:40:00,459
Your Majesty.

1597
01:40:01,960 --> 01:40:04,838
Dear Joseph.

1598
01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:08,300
Am I too late...

1599
01:40:09,802 --> 01:40:13,305
to ask you to accept my hand in marriage?

1600
01:40:14,932 --> 01:40:16,558
(CLEARS THROAT)

1601
01:40:18,644 --> 01:40:20,479
Well, I thought you'd never ask.

1602
01:40:21,730 --> 01:40:22,730
Shades?

1603
01:40:24,316 --> 01:40:27,069
You're in charge now.
Good luck with Lionel.

1604
01:40:28,695 --> 01:40:29,905
I'm going to a wedding.

1605
01:40:30,155 --> 01:40:32,658
MABREY: <i>Open up, I say! The door is shut.</i>

1606
01:40:33,116 --> 01:40:34,493
<i>Let me in.</i>

1607
01:40:36,161 --> 01:40:37,454
<i>Put me down. Put me down!</i>

1608
01:40:49,967 --> 01:40:52,386
I know it was short notice,
but you were all dressed.

1609
01:40:52,636 --> 01:41:00,636
My Lord Archbishop, I would like to take
this man as my husband, if you please.

1610
01:41:06,316 --> 01:41:07,359
Finally.

1611
01:41:08,610 --> 01:41:10,987
We have come together
for a different wedding...

1612
01:41:10,988 --> 01:41:13,239
- What did I miss?
- She's not getting married.

1613
01:41:13,240 --> 01:41:14,574
- She's not getting married?
- No.

1614
01:41:14,575 --> 01:41:16,910
With this ring, I thee...

1615
01:41:17,828 --> 01:41:19,246
finally...

1616
01:41:19,496 --> 01:41:20,496
wed.

1617
01:41:20,789 --> 01:41:22,999
- Now the queen's getting married.
- The queen's getting married?

1618
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:24,042
Yeah, to Joe.

1619
01:41:25,043 --> 01:41:27,087
I pronounce you man and wife.

1620
01:41:28,130 --> 01:41:29,548
You may kiss the bride.

1621
01:41:48,317 --> 01:41:53,071
MAN: <i>The ceremonial shooting of the
flaming arrow through the coronation ring.</i>

1622
01:42:19,014 --> 01:42:22,183
<i>ELSIE: Good morning. It's been
almost a week since the almost wedding,</i>

1623
01:42:22,184 --> 01:42:25,687
and busy workers
are setting up for Genovia's grand day.

1624
01:42:25,938 --> 01:42:28,106
<i>The coronation of a new queen.</i>

1625
01:42:28,440 --> 01:42:31,692
<i>Somewhere in the palace, Princess Mia's
getting ready for the ceremony</i>

1626
01:42:31,693 --> 01:42:34,488
that will change her life forever.

1627
01:42:37,783 --> 01:42:39,535
So what do you say, Fat Louie?

1628
01:42:40,577 --> 01:42:42,120
Think I'll make a good queen?

1629
01:42:44,498 --> 01:42:45,499
Indeed you will.

1630
01:42:47,960 --> 01:42:51,672
If I may be so bold, I would like
an audience with Your Highness.

1631
01:42:59,429 --> 01:43:01,181
What is your dilemma, young man?

1632
01:43:02,015 --> 01:43:03,684
You are, in fact.

1633
01:43:08,981 --> 01:43:11,024
I'm in love with the queen-to-be.

1634
01:43:12,776 --> 01:43:15,571
And I'm inquiring if she loves me too.

1635
01:43:18,532 --> 01:43:20,826
Do you have a chicken for my table?

1636
01:43:21,743 --> 01:43:25,330
No. No, my kitchen is out of chickens.

1637
01:43:25,747 --> 01:43:26,747
Ah.

1638
01:43:32,171 --> 01:43:33,213
Mia.

1639
01:43:55,944 --> 01:43:59,531
<i>KELLY: Company, atten... hurgh!</i>

1640
01:43:59,740 --> 01:44:02,159
Forward march.

1641
01:44:02,493 --> 01:44:03,910
Left, right, left.

1642
01:44:03,911 --> 01:44:06,246

Left, left...

1649
01:44:19,718 --> 01:44:21,637
Company, halt.

1650
01:44:23,597 --> 01:44:26,308
I heard you're going back
to Berkeley to finish up graduate school.

1651
01:44:26,683 --> 01:44:27,683
You heard right.

1652
01:44:28,477 --> 01:44:30,437
May I call you in California?

1653
01:44:30,729 --> 01:44:34,900
I think I can hear you
without a phone, but, uh...

1654
01:44:40,989 --> 01:44:44,827
Sparrow is taking off.

1655
01:44:46,620 --> 01:44:49,623
The eagle is flying for the last time.

1656
