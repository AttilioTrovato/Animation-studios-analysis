00:00:05,105 --> 00:00:07,371
Man's voice: <i>One, two, three.</i>

2
00:00:15,781 --> 00:00:21,484
¶ You can't sit around waiting
for the path to glory ¶

3
00:00:21,486 --> 00:00:26,621
¶ you've got to get moving
to tell your story ¶

4
00:00:26,623 --> 00:00:31,359
¶ the bigger they come,
the harder they fall ¶

5
00:00:31,361 --> 00:00:35,763
¶ from the littlest acorns
come trees so tall ¶

6
00:00:35,765 --> 00:00:42,236
¶ and where you're coming from
is where you're going ¶

7
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:46,373
¶ until you get there
you got no way of knowing ¶

8
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:48,641
¶ all the love in the world ¶

9
00:00:48,643 --> 00:00:52,177
¶ won't find you
if you don't let it ¶

10
00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:56,314
¶ let it ride,
let it ride, let it ride ¶

11
00:00:56,316 --> 00:01:01,785
¶ and every mistake is a break
but only if you get it ¶

12
00:01:01,787 --> 00:01:07,189
¶ let it ride,
let it ride, let it ride ¶

13
00:01:27,075 --> 00:01:29,308
¶ And all the love
in the world ¶

14
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,177
¶ won't find you
if you don't let it ¶

15
00:01:32,179 --> 00:01:37,248
¶ let it ride,
let it ride, let it ride ¶

16
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:41,852
¶ and every mistake is a break

17
00:01:41,854 --> 00:01:46,656
¶ let it ride,
let it ride, let it ride ¶

18
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:51,560
¶ Every day
is a brand-new place ¶

19
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:57,165
¶ Feel the sun upon your face ¶

20
00:01:57,167 --> 00:02:00,334
¶ try something new ¶

21
00:02:00,336 --> 00:02:01,435
¶ you won't regret it ¶

22
00:02:01,437 --> 00:02:03,503
¶ the hole in your shoe ¶

23
00:02:03,505 --> 00:02:07,306
¶ buddy, just forget it ¶
whoo! Hey-hey!

24
00:02:07,308 --> 00:02:10,375
¶ Let it ride ¶

25
00:02:10,377 --> 00:02:12,310
¶ oh, you got to let it... ¶

26
00:02:12,312 --> 00:02:15,313
stage dive, stage dive, stage dive.
¶ let it ride, let it ride ¶

27
00:02:15,315 --> 00:02:16,781
whoa! ¶ Let it ride ¶

28
00:02:16,783 --> 00:02:20,351
¶ let it ride ¶

29
00:02:20,353 --> 00:02:21,685
¶ oh, you got to let it ¶

30
00:02:21,687 --> 00:02:23,853
¶ let it ride,
let it ride, let it ride. ¶

31
00:02:23,855 --> 00:02:25,354
whoa, oh!

32
00:02:25,356 --> 00:02:26,588
Hey!

33
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:27,488
¶ Let it ride ¶

34
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,490
oh-ho.

35
00:02:31,694 --> 00:02:33,193
Vroom!

36
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:37,297
¶ Let it ride,
let it ride, let it ride ¶

37
00:02:37,299 --> 00:02:39,699
¶ let it ride ¶

38
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:42,168
¶ oh, you got to let it ¶

39
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:47,305
¶ let it ride,
let it ride, let it ride. ¶

40
00:03:00,918 --> 00:03:02,217
Yeah!

41
00:03:08,891 --> 00:03:12,325
Man: The country bears
officially broke up

42
00:03:12,327 --> 00:03:15,227
after the '91 hibernation tour.

43
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:17,762
It's actually hard to imagine
popular music without the bears.

44
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:19,296
I learned a lot from those guys

45
00:03:19,298 --> 00:03:20,597
and that was why I was so sad

46
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:21,731
to see them break up.

47
00:03:21,733 --> 00:03:24,500
Fred:
I guess I miss the old days

48
00:03:24,502 --> 00:03:26,502
at country bear hall.

49
00:03:26,504 --> 00:03:27,803
We was kinda...

50
00:03:27,805 --> 00:03:29,671
Different, you see?

51
00:03:29,673 --> 00:03:31,572
And, uh, at country bear hall

52
00:03:31,574 --> 00:03:34,274
you could be different
and still fit in.

53
00:03:34,276 --> 00:03:36,809
Yup. Different. Mm-hmm.

54
00:03:36,811 --> 00:03:40,512
Boy: Hey, beary.

55
00:03:40,514 --> 00:03:43,348
Doofus, it's time for dinner.

56
00:03:52,792 --> 00:03:53,824
Dad: Sit down, Dex.

57
00:03:53,826 --> 00:03:55,492
Okay, that's enough,
that's enough.

58
00:03:55,494 --> 00:03:56,759
Napkin's not a toy, Dex.

59
00:03:56,761 --> 00:03:57,960
I'm really not that hungry.

60
00:03:57,962 --> 00:03:59,561
Mom?

61
00:03:59,563 --> 00:04:01,296
Am I adopted?

62
00:04:01,298 --> 00:04:05,466
Well... of course not, honey.

63
00:04:05,468 --> 00:04:06,600
Eat your fish.

64
00:04:06,602 --> 00:04:07,801
Yes, you are.

65
00:04:07,803 --> 00:04:09,836
Um... why would you
think that, beary?

66
00:04:09,838 --> 00:04:11,470
I don't know.

67
00:04:11,472 --> 00:04:14,406
Sometimes I feel... Different.

68
00:04:14,408 --> 00:04:15,707
Like Dex and me.

69
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:17,675
We don't look the same.

70
00:04:17,677 --> 00:04:19,576
Our eyes are different colors

71
00:04:19,578 --> 00:04:22,779
and he has freckles,
and I don't.

72
00:04:22,781 --> 00:04:23,946
I think.

73
00:04:23,948 --> 00:04:24,746
Are you serious?

74
00:04:24,748 --> 00:04:25,747
That's why you think

75
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:26,581
you're different?

76
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:27,782
Dad: You know, um...

77
00:04:27,784 --> 00:04:31,752
Last week it was "casual
Friday" at the office

78
00:04:31,754 --> 00:04:33,820
and I guess I forgot

79
00:04:33,822 --> 00:04:36,422
and I wore a tie.

80
00:04:37,558 --> 00:04:38,690
And boy...

81
00:04:38,692 --> 00:04:40,892
Did I feel different!

82
00:04:40,894 --> 00:04:42,360
It was...

83
00:04:42,362 --> 00:04:43,561
Yeah.

84
00:04:43,563 --> 00:04:44,795
The point is

85
00:04:44,797 --> 00:04:48,431
that it's not unusual
to feel different

86
00:04:48,433 --> 00:04:49,832
and...

87
00:04:49,834 --> 00:04:52,334
Those differences
always lead us

88
00:04:52,336 --> 00:04:53,835
to our higher purpose.

89
00:04:53,837 --> 00:04:55,503
Higher purpose?

90
00:04:55,505 --> 00:04:58,272
Honey, even if you were adopted

91
00:04:58,274 --> 00:05:01,441
we would love you
as much as we love Dexter.

92
00:05:01,443 --> 00:05:02,508
Maybe more.

93
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,610
Just remember, son

94
00:05:04,612 --> 00:05:07,412
the people who love
you no matter what...

95
00:05:07,414 --> 00:05:08,646
That's your family.

96
00:05:08,648 --> 00:05:11,749
Okay.

97
00:05:11,751 --> 00:05:13,484
I'm going to go practice.

98
00:05:13,486 --> 00:05:14,618
Did you know

99
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,886
the bears made
the only country song

100
00:05:16,888 --> 00:05:18,921
ever go be recorded in Polish?!

101
00:05:18,923 --> 00:05:20,255
Whoa! Really?!

102
00:05:20,257 --> 00:05:22,624
And did you know
that nobody cares?

103
00:05:29,932 --> 00:05:31,331
Way to go, doofus.

104
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,565
You're, like, totally wrecking

105
00:05:32,567 --> 00:05:33,999
this family.

106
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:35,300
Um, what are you talking about?

107
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:39,803
You really want to know
what I'm talking about?

108
00:05:43,642 --> 00:05:47,543
Okay, this is my baby picture.

109
00:05:47,545 --> 00:05:48,544
This is yours.

110
00:05:48,546 --> 00:05:49,545
Yeah?

111
00:05:49,547 --> 00:05:50,846
See this?

112
00:05:50,848 --> 00:05:52,948
This is my birth certificate.

113
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,349
Here's yours.

114
00:05:54,351 --> 00:05:57,685
The rangers used this
to track you.

115
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:03,757
So... what's your point?

116
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,792
Forget it.

117
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,294
That?

118
00:06:10,296 --> 00:06:12,529
That's the day
mom and dad got you.

119
00:06:12,531 --> 00:06:13,897
What do you mean...

120
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:14,964
"Got me"?

121
00:06:14,966 --> 00:06:16,699
I mean, picked you up, man.

122
00:06:16,701 --> 00:06:17,900
You were left alone.

123
00:06:17,902 --> 00:06:20,969
They brought you home,
they showed you

124
00:06:20,971 --> 00:06:22,470
a bunch of Barney videos

125
00:06:22,472 --> 00:06:24,638
and they pretended
you were their son.

126
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,641
You don't belong here.

127
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,626
At country bear hall

128
00:06:51,628 --> 00:06:56,730
you could be different
and still fit in.

129
00:06:56,732 --> 00:06:59,032
Yup. Different.

130
00:07:29,362 --> 00:07:34,631
¶ Sometimes
it's just the goin' ¶

131
00:07:34,633 --> 00:07:36,766
¶ you've got to go ¶

132
00:07:36,768 --> 00:07:43,638
¶ and you don't even know
if it's the right thing to do ¶

133
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:48,975
¶ nobody else can be showin' ¶

134
00:07:48,977 --> 00:07:51,978
¶ which way to go ¶

135
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:55,815
¶ and you're not even sure
of where you're goin' to ¶

136
00:07:55,817 --> 00:07:58,417
¶ but it's a start ¶

137
00:07:59,787 --> 00:08:03,688
¶ in your heart ¶

138
00:08:06,526 --> 00:08:10,961
¶ Sometimes
it's just the goin'... ¶

139
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:27,475
Country bear hall!

140
00:08:29,912 --> 00:08:31,878
Wow!

141
00:08:38,085 --> 00:08:40,752
Whoa! Hey! Uh...

142
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:56,434
Man: 25 cents?!

143
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:58,169
Do you have change
for a hundred?

144
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,071
Hello, Reed.

145
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:02,939
I thought
you weren't coming back

146
00:09:02,941 --> 00:09:04,674
until you could
tear the place down.

147
00:09:04,676 --> 00:09:06,709
That's a whole
four days away, Henry.

148
00:09:06,711 --> 00:09:07,910
The people

149
00:09:07,912 --> 00:09:09,678
that owned the bank before you

150
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,945
wouldn't mind

151
00:09:10,947 --> 00:09:13,180
if I got behind in my payments
a month or two.

152
00:09:13,182 --> 00:09:15,015
They'd cut me some slack.

153
00:09:15,017 --> 00:09:17,684
Uh-huh. How far behind
are you right now?

154
00:09:17,686 --> 00:09:20,286
Uh... six...

155
00:09:20,288 --> 00:09:21,720
Years.

156
00:09:21,722 --> 00:09:23,154
Six years?

157
00:09:23,156 --> 00:09:25,156
$20,000.

158
00:09:25,158 --> 00:09:26,323
Must be tough.

159
00:09:26,325 --> 00:09:28,191
You had a good run, Henry

160
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:31,627
but good things must come
to an end, luckily.

161
00:09:31,629 --> 00:09:34,029
That also applies
to lame junkie things

162
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:35,663
like country bear hall.

163
00:09:35,665 --> 00:09:37,865
Do you like the sound
of crunching wood?

164
00:09:37,867 --> 00:09:39,032
I do.

165
00:09:56,348 --> 00:09:59,682
Oh, like that's going to help.

166
00:10:02,253 --> 00:10:03,986
Brother...

167
00:10:21,338 --> 00:10:24,272
If you're going to stand there

168
00:10:24,274 --> 00:10:29,343
you might as well
give me a hand.

169
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,212
What's that?

170
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:35,048
A sign.

171
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:39,085
Yeah, but... "Destroy"?

172
00:10:39,087 --> 00:10:40,753
Right.

173
00:10:40,755 --> 00:10:42,087
Well...

174
00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:43,855
They're going to tear down

175
00:10:43,857 --> 00:10:45,923
country bear hall.

176
00:10:45,925 --> 00:10:49,192
Tear down country bear hall?

177
00:10:49,194 --> 00:10:50,293
Yeah.

178
00:10:50,295 --> 00:10:53,195
Tear down country bear hall?!

179
00:10:53,197 --> 00:10:56,798
Uh...

180
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,132
Yeah.

181
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,272
Sir, officer hamm.

182
00:11:06,274 --> 00:11:07,840
And officer cheets.

183
00:11:07,842 --> 00:11:09,641
Hamm and cheets?

184
00:11:09,643 --> 00:11:10,742
Yeah.

185
00:11:10,744 --> 00:11:13,745
W-we get that all the time.

186
00:11:13,747 --> 00:11:15,246
Well, it's your name.

187
00:11:15,248 --> 00:11:16,747
Mm-hmm. Uh-huh.

188
00:11:21,753 --> 00:11:24,720
I thought you
officers might enjoy

189
00:11:24,722 --> 00:11:25,887
a little nibble of something.

190
00:11:25,889 --> 00:11:26,854
Ah...

191
00:11:26,856 --> 00:11:27,988
When I'm upset, I bake.

192
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,326
Please help yourself!

193
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:40,430
Okay, um... About your boy...

194
00:11:40,432 --> 00:11:43,666
Um, his name is beary.

195
00:11:43,668 --> 00:11:45,034
"B-a-r..."

196
00:11:45,036 --> 00:11:48,137
No, it's "b-e-a-r"

197
00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:49,738
like in...

198
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,006
The German spelling
of the name.

199
00:11:53,109 --> 00:11:55,776
Oh, man, are you kidding me?!

200
00:11:57,713 --> 00:11:59,145
Don't worry, young buck.

201
00:11:59,147 --> 00:12:01,213
We'll find your
brother for you.

202
00:12:01,215 --> 00:12:02,280
Here now.

203
00:12:02,282 --> 00:12:03,414
There we go.

204
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:06,016
Now you're an honorary deputy.

205
00:12:06,018 --> 00:12:07,283
Gee, thanks.

206
00:12:07,285 --> 00:12:09,184
I'm sure all the kids
on the playground

207
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:10,385
will be really impressed.

208
00:12:10,387 --> 00:12:13,254
Yeah, well, don't
arrest anybody.

209
00:12:17,193 --> 00:12:20,427
Henry: <i>Yeah, this place would
fill up every weekend night.</i>

210
00:12:20,429 --> 00:12:22,061
Really?

211
00:12:22,063 --> 00:12:24,997
I tell you, a lot of great
music was on that stage.

212
00:12:24,999 --> 00:12:28,233
There's flat and scruggs,
liver lips McGraw, gomer.

213
00:12:28,235 --> 00:12:31,336
Jimi Hendrix opened here
for vanilla fudge.

214
00:12:31,338 --> 00:12:36,074
But nobody, but nobody was
like the country bears.

215
00:12:36,076 --> 00:12:39,744
Huh! Place would be packed...
people sitting everywhere

216
00:12:39,746 --> 00:12:42,079
even up in the rafters.

217
00:12:42,081 --> 00:12:43,280
You know, sometimes

218
00:12:43,282 --> 00:12:44,948
I'd climb up there
just to hear the notes.

219
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:46,082
What notes?

220
00:12:46,084 --> 00:12:48,350
The music.

221
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:51,786
The millions of notes
that floated up there...

222
00:12:51,788 --> 00:12:54,922
Some of the best
darn notes ever.

223
00:12:54,924 --> 00:12:57,257
Well, why don't you stop them

224
00:12:57,259 --> 00:13:00,760
before they start
to tear the place down?

225
00:13:00,762 --> 00:13:01,761
Why?

226
00:13:01,763 --> 00:13:03,996
$20,000, that's why.

227
00:13:03,998 --> 00:13:06,231
You don't got it,
I don't got it.

228
00:13:06,233 --> 00:13:09,334
Good-bye, country bear hall.

229
00:13:09,336 --> 00:13:11,336
I can't raise
that kind of cash.

230
00:13:11,338 --> 00:13:15,173
Four days from now, this
place comes a-tumbling down.

231
00:13:19,979 --> 00:13:22,212
Wait a minute.

232
00:13:22,214 --> 00:13:24,347
Wait a minute!

233
00:13:24,349 --> 00:13:27,116
I got it!

234
00:13:27,117 --> 00:13:29,884
I heard that some people
have a higher purpose in life.

235
00:13:29,887 --> 00:13:30,886
Well.

236
00:13:30,888 --> 00:13:32,087
I belong here.

237
00:13:32,089 --> 00:13:34,789
I belong here helping
you save this place.

238
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:36,223
Nah.

239
00:13:36,225 --> 00:13:38,792
And we can do it with a
concert to raise the money.

240
00:13:38,794 --> 00:13:40,527
We can get the band
back together!

241
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:41,828
Get the band back to...!

242
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:42,829
Uh-huh.

243
00:13:42,831 --> 00:13:44,063
Get the... get the...!

244
00:13:44,065 --> 00:13:46,031
Oh, that's the stupidest thing.

245
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:47,532
Never in a million years.

246
00:13:47,534 --> 00:13:49,800
But this place... it's historic.

247
00:13:49,802 --> 00:13:50,834
No.

248
00:13:50,836 --> 00:13:52,268
The notes in the rafters.

249
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,369
No! I know they'll do it.

250
00:13:53,371 --> 00:13:55,070
Oh, come on now.
They could play a show.

251
00:13:55,072 --> 00:13:56,071
Now, stop it, okay?

252
00:13:56,073 --> 00:13:57,939
Just forget it. Stop it.

253
00:13:57,941 --> 00:13:59,040
But wait, you're not...

254
00:13:59,042 --> 00:14:00,808
I said stop!

255
00:14:02,344 --> 00:14:04,844
It's over.

256
00:14:04,846 --> 00:14:06,879
Uh...

257
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:10,081
Dumb kid.

258
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,082
Stupid idea.

259
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:13,117
Get the band back together.

260
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,319
You could do that.

261
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:17,554
Oh, look, even if we
found them, uh...

262
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:19,389
A concert?

263
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,990
Yeah, you need equipment

264
00:14:20,992 --> 00:14:23,559
and tickets and promotion
and... everything.

265
00:14:23,561 --> 00:14:24,560
I don't know.

266
00:14:24,562 --> 00:14:26,461
I could do that.

267
00:14:26,463 --> 00:14:28,796
Oh, Al.

268
00:14:28,798 --> 00:14:30,397
Look, let's face it.

269
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,032
In a week from now,
some teenager's

270
00:14:33,034 --> 00:14:36,902
going to be teaching us
how to operate a deep fryer.

271
00:14:36,904 --> 00:14:41,373
We could do that.

272
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:43,975
Does he have
any distinguishing marks

273
00:14:43,977 --> 00:14:46,544
something that we can
recognize him by?

274
00:14:48,414 --> 00:14:50,013
Yeah.

275
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:51,114
He's got thick brown hair...

276
00:14:51,116 --> 00:14:55,017
All over his body.

277
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:59,454
Uh, you know, I think I may have
a recent photograph of him

278
00:14:59,456 --> 00:15:01,289
if-if that would help you out.

279
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:04,191
Oh... he looks like a...

280
00:15:04,193 --> 00:15:05,225
Fourth grader?

281
00:15:05,227 --> 00:15:06,526
That's right. Yeah.

282
00:15:06,528 --> 00:15:08,160
Cutie pie.

283
00:15:10,931 --> 00:15:12,597
Okay, you know what?

284
00:15:12,599 --> 00:15:14,398
I'm going to go to my room now

285
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,234
and, uh, I'm going to
stay there till I'm 18.

286
00:15:18,937 --> 00:15:21,470
Okay, we're all done here.

287
00:15:21,472 --> 00:15:22,971
Are you going to find him?

288
00:15:22,973 --> 00:15:26,140
Ma'am, we're going
to do more than that.

289
00:15:26,142 --> 00:15:28,175
How are we going
to do more than that?

290
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,276
Huh?

291
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:31,211
What are we going to do,
find him twice?

292
00:15:31,213 --> 00:15:32,212
All right.

293
00:15:32,214 --> 00:15:34,080
Let's get mobile.

294
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:39,184
¶ There's a town down the road ¶

295
00:15:39,186 --> 00:15:43,188
¶ where I ain't been before ¶

296
00:15:45,925 --> 00:15:49,026
¶ Nobody knows my name ¶

297
00:15:49,028 --> 00:15:52,062
¶ or what I'm looking for ¶

298
00:15:54,266 --> 00:15:57,500
¶ Maybe things will be
a little different ¶

299
00:15:57,502 --> 00:16:01,070
¶ 'cause it can't
stay the same... ¶

300
00:16:03,474 --> 00:16:06,308
Beary: ¶ I'm gonna ease
on down the road ¶

301
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:07,342
hmm?

302
00:16:07,344 --> 00:16:09,610
¶ Where nobody knows my name ¶

303
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:17,982
¶ If they think about me
tonight ¶

304
00:16:17,984 --> 00:16:22,052
¶ I know
they won't miss the pain ¶

305
00:16:22,054 --> 00:16:26,456
¶ 'cause I'll be taking it
down the road ¶

306
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:31,227
¶ where nobody knows my name ¶

307
00:16:31,229 --> 00:16:33,229
¶ yeah. ¶

308
00:16:33,231 --> 00:16:34,563
uh...

309
00:16:34,565 --> 00:16:35,564
Hey.

310
00:16:35,566 --> 00:16:38,199
Henry?

311
00:16:38,201 --> 00:16:42,136
Uh, well, if we're going
to get the band back together

312
00:16:42,138 --> 00:16:44,238
we're going to need
some transportation.

313
00:17:00,254 --> 00:17:01,653
Hey, beary, meet roadie.

314
00:17:01,655 --> 00:17:02,654
Hi.

315
00:17:02,656 --> 00:17:03,988
Have you seen my chicken?

316
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,189
Uh, no.

317
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:07,191
Big Al: Get off my grass.

318
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:12,530
He was making a mess
on my grass.

319
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,165
I'm sorry, big Al.

320
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:16,166
Yeah.

321
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:17,300
Peace.

322
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:19,568
Henry: The original
country bear tour bus.

323
00:17:23,307 --> 00:17:24,339
Beary: Whoa.

324
00:17:26,176 --> 00:17:28,109
Wow.

325
00:17:29,445 --> 00:17:32,446
Henry:
Oh, yeah, pretty neat, huh?

326
00:17:32,448 --> 00:17:33,713
Beary: Uh-huh. Wow.

327
00:17:33,715 --> 00:17:35,181
Hey, uh...

328
00:17:35,183 --> 00:17:37,650
Get the place ready
for the concert, big Al.

329
00:17:37,652 --> 00:17:40,319
I'm counting on you.

330
00:17:40,321 --> 00:17:41,486
Let's hit it, roadie.

331
00:17:41,488 --> 00:17:42,520
Don't you worry

332
00:17:42,522 --> 00:17:44,755
about nothing, Henry.

333
00:17:44,757 --> 00:17:49,226
You just go get them boys.

334
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:56,131
Oh, and be careful of my...

335
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,734
Grass.

336
00:18:08,576 --> 00:18:10,809
¶ So you want to be
a rock 'n' roll star ¶

337
00:18:10,811 --> 00:18:14,646
¶ then listen now
to what I say ¶

338
00:18:14,648 --> 00:18:17,315
¶ just get an electric guitar ¶

339
00:18:17,317 --> 00:18:20,518
¶ and take some time
and learn how to play ¶

340
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:24,722
¶ and in a week or two,
if you make the charts ¶

341
00:18:24,724 --> 00:18:26,356
¶ the girls
will tear you apart... ¶

342
00:18:26,358 --> 00:18:28,324
beary: So, is Fred still
in show business?

343
00:18:28,326 --> 00:18:31,694
Henry:
Yeah, you could say that.

344
00:18:31,696 --> 00:18:32,695
Hey, Fred.

345
00:18:32,697 --> 00:18:33,829
Morning.

346
00:18:33,831 --> 00:18:35,430
How's it going, Fred?

347
00:18:35,432 --> 00:18:36,563
Okay.

348
00:18:40,101 --> 00:18:41,333
Excuse me.

349
00:18:41,335 --> 00:18:43,101
Sorry, got to be part
of the video shoot.

350
00:18:43,103 --> 00:18:45,470
I kind of am the video shoot.

351
00:18:45,472 --> 00:18:46,537
Hmm?

352
00:18:46,539 --> 00:18:48,338
Oh, krystal, hey, sorry.

353
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,306
I am so happy to see you.

354
00:18:50,308 --> 00:18:51,440
Uh, really?

355
00:18:51,442 --> 00:18:52,741
Could you help me get my stuff?

356
00:18:52,743 --> 00:18:54,809
Yeah.

357
00:18:54,811 --> 00:18:56,277
What you been up to?

358
00:18:56,279 --> 00:18:57,311
Uh, not much.

359
00:18:57,313 --> 00:18:58,845
Playing my harmonica.

360
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:00,246
Really? You play?

361
00:19:00,248 --> 00:19:01,814
Oh, yeah. I was a country...

362
00:19:04,585 --> 00:19:07,785
Bear.

363
00:19:09,388 --> 00:19:11,688
The "Fred"?

364
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,690
Wait, wait,
you're Fred bedderhead?

365
00:19:13,692 --> 00:19:15,758
Fred from the country bears?

366
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,226
Yeah.

367
00:19:17,228 --> 00:19:18,794
And didn't you invent

368
00:19:18,796 --> 00:19:22,230
Oh, yeah, but I'm

00:19:23,233 --> 00:19:24,398
You're not too old.

370
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,799
You should play with us.

371
00:19:25,801 --> 00:19:27,734

Well... all right, I suppose.

Whoo!

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,439
Ooh!

429
00:21:46,441 --> 00:21:48,507
Oh, Fred.

430
00:21:49,576 --> 00:21:51,275
Hey, Fred, you all right?

431
00:21:51,277 --> 00:21:52,276
Uh...

432
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:56,479
Uh, the dive works better...

433
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,247
Yeah, with an audience, right?

434
00:21:58,249 --> 00:21:59,248
Yeah.

435
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,415
Yeah.

436
00:22:00,417 --> 00:22:01,682
Well, if you're all right

437
00:22:01,684 --> 00:22:03,517
I gotta go get ready
for the shoot.

438
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:04,551
Okay.

439
00:22:04,553 --> 00:22:06,352
It was fun. Sure was.

440
00:22:06,354 --> 00:22:09,021
Wish I could play some more.

441
00:22:09,023 --> 00:22:11,523
Henry: I might be able to
help you out with that.

442
00:22:11,525 --> 00:22:14,526
Huh? Henry?

443
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:16,728
Get the band back together?

444
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:17,829
You can do it.

445
00:22:17,831 --> 00:22:19,664
You're Fred bedderhead

446
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:22,867

Oh, that's beary,

00:22:29,775 --> 00:22:32,709
How you going to get people

451
00:22:32,711 --> 00:22:34,410
Why don't you call
rip Holland, hen?

452
00:22:34,412 --> 00:22:35,544
Rip Holland?

453
00:22:35,546 --> 00:22:37,679
The guy who stole
the band from me?

454
00:22:37,681 --> 00:22:40,314
Call rip, yeah.

455
00:22:40,316 --> 00:22:41,415
Rip Holland.

456
00:22:41,417 --> 00:22:43,049
Uh, rip?

457
00:22:43,051 --> 00:22:45,684
Henry?

458
00:22:45,686 --> 00:22:47,285
Yeah.

459
00:22:47,287 --> 00:22:49,987
Oh, hey, how you doing, buddy?

460
00:22:49,989 --> 00:22:52,522
Long time, no talk, huh?

461
00:22:52,524 --> 00:22:54,357
So, are you nearby?

462
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:57,727
Uh, the boys and I are putting
on this reunion show

463
00:22:57,729 --> 00:22:59,962
at bear hall
this Saturday night.

464
00:22:59,964 --> 00:23:02,698
Oh, I get it, I get it.

465
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,466
You just called to gloat.

466
00:23:04,468 --> 00:23:05,700
Well, you listen to me...

467
00:23:05,702 --> 00:23:07,334
Oh, no, no, no, rip, rip, rip.

468
00:23:07,336 --> 00:23:08,535
I called...

469
00:23:10,988 --> 00:23:13,438
'Cause I thought we could put
aside the old stuff, and, uh...

470
00:23:13,441 --> 00:23:16,642
Well, I was hoping you could
promote the show.

471
00:23:16,644 --> 00:23:18,410
I don't know, but let me

472
00:23:18,412 --> 00:23:19,711
check my calendar.

473
00:23:24,649 --> 00:23:26,782
Well, it's going to be a squeeze

474
00:23:26,784 --> 00:23:29,384
but I think a little juggling

475
00:23:29,386 --> 00:23:31,386
I can fit it in.

476
00:23:31,388 --> 00:23:32,687
Well, that's great.

477
00:23:33,956 --> 00:23:36,056
Well, okay, this Saturday night
at 8:00, then.

478
00:23:36,058 --> 00:23:37,490
You got it, Henry.

479
00:23:39,026 --> 00:23:43,627
I am so back, baby!

480
00:23:43,629 --> 00:23:44,894
Excuse me, sir.

481
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:46,562
This is the last time
I'm going to tell you.

482
00:23:46,564 --> 00:23:48,363
You're going to have
to leave the store.

483
00:23:48,365 --> 00:23:50,431
Yeah, right, like I need you.

484
00:23:51,834 --> 00:23:53,099
Do you know who I am?

485
00:23:53,101 --> 00:23:55,067
I'm rip Holland... rip Holland.

486
00:23:55,069 --> 00:23:56,068
That's ours.

487
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,335
Right.

488
00:23:59,806 --> 00:24:02,940
Henry: You know, Fred, you were
the only one who ever wrote me.

489
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:04,875
You know where
any of the other boys are?

490
00:24:04,877 --> 00:24:06,810
Fred:
Zeb never gave up the honey.

491
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:08,913
Hangs out at a bar
in nuttville.

492
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:18,188
Oh, that's a nice scrapbook
there, beary.

493
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,523
Thanks.

494
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:22,458
I've been working
on it forever.

495
00:24:23,794 --> 00:24:24,959
I really like

496
00:24:24,961 --> 00:24:26,193
this picture.

497
00:24:26,195 --> 00:24:28,061
You used to have a lot of hair.

498
00:24:28,063 --> 00:24:32,465
Uh... yeah, well...
Oh, look at this one.

499
00:24:32,467 --> 00:24:34,934
Winning that talent show
was our big break.

500
00:24:34,936 --> 00:24:36,568
What's an "arm musician"?

501
00:24:37,637 --> 00:24:38,902
That's Benny bogswaggle.

502
00:24:38,904 --> 00:24:41,437
He was real talented.

503
00:24:47,644 --> 00:24:49,043
But he was a bad loser.

504
00:24:49,045 --> 00:24:50,911
Wait, wait, wait a minute.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

505
00:24:50,913 --> 00:24:53,713
He hit zeb with a chair.

506
00:24:59,853 --> 00:25:01,185
What's that?

507
00:25:01,187 --> 00:25:04,254
That there's a sign.

508
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:06,556
I'm aware of that.

509
00:25:06,558 --> 00:25:09,525
"Reunion benefit concert."

510
00:25:09,527 --> 00:25:11,493
Uh, watch the grass.

511
00:25:11,495 --> 00:25:13,795
Where's Henry?

512
00:25:13,797 --> 00:25:16,898
In the bears bus,
picking up the band.

513
00:25:17,967 --> 00:25:20,734
You mean, he's...

514
00:25:20,736 --> 00:25:23,136
He's not actually serious.

515
00:25:23,138 --> 00:25:24,170
Oh, yeah.

516
00:25:24,172 --> 00:25:25,237
Even got

517
00:25:25,239 --> 00:25:27,072
rip Holland to promote it.

518
00:25:27,074 --> 00:25:29,207
Rip Holland? Really?

519
00:25:29,209 --> 00:25:30,708
You bet.

520
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:31,709
Uh, come here.

521
00:25:32,678 --> 00:25:35,111
You see, Henry says

522
00:25:35,113 --> 00:25:38,514
we do this here concert,
and we raise

523
00:25:38,516 --> 00:25:40,782
that $20,000

524
00:25:40,784 --> 00:25:43,984
we could tell that
little weasel banker to, uh...

525
00:25:46,188 --> 00:25:47,854
Oops.

526
00:25:47,856 --> 00:25:49,255
Tell the weasel what?

527
00:25:49,257 --> 00:25:50,556
Uh...

528
00:25:50,558 --> 00:25:52,658
Uh, over yonder...

529
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,992
a monkey.

530
00:25:56,162 --> 00:25:59,129
Hey.

531
00:25:59,131 --> 00:26:01,931
I'm chubby, but I'm quick.

532
00:26:07,304 --> 00:26:09,604
Rip Holland...

533
00:26:23,786 --> 00:26:25,786
¶ You told me, baby,
one more time ¶

534
00:26:25,788 --> 00:26:28,188
¶ you don't wanna sit
all alone and cry ¶

535
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:30,557
¶ well, it's over ¶

536
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:31,925
¶ I can't let go ¶

537
00:26:33,261 --> 00:26:35,160
¶ I'm like a fish out of water ¶

538
00:26:35,162 --> 00:26:36,561
¶ a cat in a tree ¶

539
00:26:36,563 --> 00:26:38,763
¶ you'll be the one
on top of me ¶

540
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:41,766
¶ well, it's over ¶

541
00:26:41,768 --> 00:26:43,601
¶ I can't let go ¶

542
00:26:43,603 --> 00:26:46,670
¶ he won't play me back
when I come around... ¶

543
00:26:46,672 --> 00:26:49,005
this way.

544
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:52,008
¶ I got a big chain
around my neck ¶

545
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:54,210
¶ I'm rollin' down
like a train wreck...¶

546
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:55,344
uh, excuse me, miss.

547
00:26:55,346 --> 00:26:57,646
Yeah?

548
00:26:57,648 --> 00:26:59,981
Uh, would you happen
to know if there's

549
00:26:59,983 --> 00:27:01,782
a zeb zoober here?

550
00:27:01,784 --> 00:27:03,116
Zeb zoober? Yeah.

551
00:27:03,118 --> 00:27:05,184
The zeb zoober
that sleeps on my floor?

552
00:27:05,186 --> 00:27:06,752
The zeb zoober
that owes me $500?

553
00:27:06,754 --> 00:27:11,222
The zeb zoober that won't stop
calling me cha-cha?

554
00:27:11,224 --> 00:27:13,123
Set me up, cha-cha!

555
00:27:14,092 --> 00:27:15,891
Sounds like him.

556
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,325
Zeb zoober.

557
00:27:18,327 --> 00:27:20,727
I can't get rid of zeb zoober.

558
00:27:38,612 --> 00:27:40,345
Hey, there, zeb.

559
00:27:44,384 --> 00:27:46,117
Henry?

560
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:48,119
Fred?

561
00:27:48,121 --> 00:27:50,254
Is that you?

562
00:27:50,256 --> 00:27:52,322
Now, come on, zeb,
what do you say?

563
00:27:52,324 --> 00:27:53,723
You give up the honey

564
00:27:53,725 --> 00:27:55,224
and come with us, hmm?

565
00:27:55,226 --> 00:27:59,027
Guys, even if I wanted
to leave town, I couldn't.

566
00:27:59,029 --> 00:28:02,030
I owe cha-cha over there
a lot of money.

567
00:28:02,032 --> 00:28:03,798
I'm hungry.

568
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,000
Want to split an order
of salmon fingers?

569
00:28:06,002 --> 00:28:07,134
Oh, Fred.

570
00:28:07,136 --> 00:28:08,668
How about twigs and berries?

571
00:28:15,174 --> 00:28:16,773
Excuse me, ma'am.

572
00:28:16,775 --> 00:28:19,208
What's that boy doing?

573
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:20,943
I don't know.

574
00:28:23,013 --> 00:28:24,946
Okay, it's a deal.

575
00:28:32,254 --> 00:28:35,755
You're zeb zoober.

576
00:28:35,757 --> 00:28:37,790
Yeah, well, that may be true
but, I-I...

577
00:28:38,893 --> 00:28:40,092
Who is this guy?

578
00:28:40,094 --> 00:28:41,726
Well, that's beary.

579
00:28:41,728 --> 00:28:43,027
Uh, ladies and gentlemen

580
00:28:43,029 --> 00:28:45,295
can I have your attention
here for a minute?

581
00:28:45,297 --> 00:28:47,797
Now, as most of you know

582
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:51,967
zeb zoober owes me
a whole heap of money.

583
00:28:51,969 --> 00:28:54,302
But his little friend there

584
00:28:54,304 --> 00:28:55,903
has proposed a wager.

585
00:28:55,905 --> 00:28:58,105
My house band
versus zeb's fiddle

586
00:28:58,107 --> 00:28:59,906
in a little musical duel.

587
00:28:59,908 --> 00:29:02,308
Now, if he wins,
he owes me nothing

588
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:06,779
but if he loses, I get to keep
the country bear tour bus.

589
00:29:06,781 --> 00:29:09,181
What? This should be good.

590
00:29:09,183 --> 00:29:12,784
Son, that bus is our only
means of transportation.

591
00:29:12,786 --> 00:29:14,986
Not to mention
that's where I raised my kids.

592
00:29:14,988 --> 00:29:16,087
Plus, I don't think

593
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:19,056
you've all seen the house band.

594
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:28,031
¶ Hey, there, bear, I know
you'd like a little honey ¶

595
00:29:28,033 --> 00:29:31,701
¶ but your credit's no good,
man, you're out of money ¶

596
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:35,071
¶ I heard you can play
the fiddle with the best ¶

597
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:38,908
¶ well, I'm here
a-puttin' you to the test ¶

598
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:43,045
¶ I'm hereby challenging you
to a duel ¶

599
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:44,312
¶ 'tween my guitar
and your fiddle ¶

600
00:29:44,314 --> 00:29:46,247
¶ you fuzzy fool ¶

601
00:29:59,327 --> 00:30:00,959
That's my guy.

602
00:30:00,961 --> 00:30:04,796
¶ Well, hey, there, mister,
that was pretty good ¶

603
00:30:04,798 --> 00:30:08,399
¶ for a local bartender
in the neighborhood ¶

604
00:30:08,401 --> 00:30:12,336
¶ well, I'm a little rusty, now,
I admit ¶

605
00:30:12,338 --> 00:30:16,173
¶ but I ain't afraid of you,
not one bit ¶

606
00:30:16,175 --> 00:30:20,377
¶ I hereby accept
your challenge to a duel ¶

607
00:30:20,379 --> 00:30:24,047
¶ your guitar and my fiddle,
you crazy fool ¶

608
00:30:24,049 --> 00:30:27,784
¶ I'm only in it for the honey ¶

609
00:30:27,786 --> 00:30:30,820
¶ it makes my head
feel kind of funny ¶

610
00:30:30,822 --> 00:30:35,257
¶ gimme that golden nectar
straight from the bees ¶

611
00:30:35,259 --> 00:30:38,927
¶ bartender, gimme some of that,
please ¶

612
00:30:43,966 --> 00:30:45,398
Yay!

613
00:30:48,836 --> 00:30:51,435
You better call a cab.

614
00:30:53,806 --> 00:30:56,006
¶ Ouch, hey, there, Mr. Fuzzy ¶

615
00:30:56,008 --> 00:30:57,440
¶ well, I guess
that settles that ¶

616
00:30:57,442 --> 00:30:59,341
¶ leave your tour bus
parked out front ¶

617
00:30:59,343 --> 00:31:01,309
¶ and the keys under the mat ¶

618
00:31:01,311 --> 00:31:03,978
¶ whoa, now, hold on
just a minute ¶

619
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,279
¶ hold that jive ¶

620
00:31:05,281 --> 00:31:07,848
¶ 'cause I can feel
this fiddle ¶

621
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:09,449
¶ 'bout to come alive ¶

622
00:31:29,802 --> 00:31:31,802
Back off, sunshine!

623
00:31:37,909 --> 00:31:39,008
Gettin' better.

624
00:31:57,058 --> 00:31:59,058
Go, zeb!

625
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,325
Yeah, go, zeb!

626
00:32:00,327 --> 00:32:01,492
Whoo-hoo!

627
00:32:01,494 --> 00:32:03,327
All right, zeb.

628
00:32:08,466 --> 00:32:10,065
That's my zeb!

629
00:32:10,067 --> 00:32:11,332
Yeah!

630
00:32:29,049 --> 00:32:31,049
¶ Broken lives ¶

631
00:32:31,051 --> 00:32:32,483
¶ broken strings ¶

632
00:32:32,485 --> 00:32:33,884
¶ broken threads ¶

633
00:32:33,886 --> 00:32:36,453
¶ broken Springs ¶

634
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:38,254
¶ broken idols ¶

635
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:39,622
¶ broken heads ¶

636
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:40,990
¶ people sleeping ¶

637
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:43,692
¶ in broken beds ¶

638
00:32:43,694 --> 00:32:45,427
¶ ain't no use jivin' ¶

00:32:45,429 --> 00:32:47,262
¶ ain't no use jokin' ¶

¶ everything's broken... ¶

641
00:32:49,165 --> 00:32:50,430
oh, no!

642
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:52,999
Oh, no!

643
00:32:54,035 --> 00:32:55,701
Oh, no!

644
00:32:55,703 --> 00:32:58,637
Country bear hall
has been crushed.

645
00:33:10,651 --> 00:33:12,250
Oh, no!

646
00:33:14,354 --> 00:33:16,287
Unit 2, this is dispatch.

647
00:33:16,289 --> 00:33:19,490
We've got a disturbance up here
at the clubhouse.

648
00:33:19,492 --> 00:33:21,091
We've got Oliver and wendall...

649
00:33:21,093 --> 00:33:22,559
stuck their heads
in the fence again.

650
00:33:22,561 --> 00:33:24,693
Can you get over here
right away, please? Over.

651
00:33:28,165 --> 00:33:30,198
What is that?

652
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,667
That's a sign.

653
00:33:34,537 --> 00:33:35,602
No, not that.

654
00:33:35,604 --> 00:33:36,703
Is that Kentucky fescue?

655
00:33:36,705 --> 00:33:39,605
Oh. Sure is.

656
00:33:39,607 --> 00:33:42,074
Mmm. Beautiful.

657
00:33:43,744 --> 00:33:45,610
Have you seen this boy?

658
00:33:45,612 --> 00:33:47,278
Hmm.

659
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,679
Yup.

660
00:33:48,681 --> 00:33:54,617
Only... in real life,
he's a lot bigger

661
00:33:54,619 --> 00:33:59,220
and not all... tiny and flat
like that.

662
00:33:59,222 --> 00:34:00,387
That's true.

663
00:34:00,389 --> 00:34:01,554
Where is he?

664
00:34:01,556 --> 00:34:03,088
Henry took him.

665
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:04,255
Henry took him?

666
00:34:04,257 --> 00:34:07,558
In the bus with roadie.

667
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,359
Now, where can we find you?

668
00:34:09,361 --> 00:34:10,426
Right here.

669
00:34:10,428 --> 00:34:16,598
Or maybe over there
in a little while.

670
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:20,468
Sometimes I'm by that... tree.

671
00:34:22,338 --> 00:34:24,371
Well, thank you very much.

672
00:34:24,373 --> 00:34:25,672
You bet.

673
00:34:27,475 --> 00:34:29,675
So, what do you think,
kidnapping?

674
00:34:29,677 --> 00:34:31,476
Yep. Let's get mobile.

675
00:34:31,478 --> 00:34:33,611
You know, would it kill you
just once

676
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:35,679
to say "let's get going,
partner"?

677
00:34:35,681 --> 00:34:37,479
Mix it up a little bit?

678
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:43,150
They like you.

679
00:35:07,408 --> 00:35:11,543
Uh, this is the harp
my daddy gave me.

680
00:35:24,156 --> 00:35:25,421
Uh, uh, hey, zeb, zeb.

681
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:27,089
I was wondering.

682
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:29,458
What ever happened to Tennessee?

683
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,293
Saw him a few years ago.

684
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:32,694
He's still the same heartbroke

685
00:35:32,696 --> 00:35:34,595
mixed-up, psycho,
basket case crybaby.

686
00:35:34,597 --> 00:35:36,430
So, what's he doing?

687
00:35:36,432 --> 00:35:37,597
He's a marriage counselor.

688
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:38,598
Huh?

689
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,599
I'm tired!

690
00:35:39,601 --> 00:35:41,500
I've been with the baby all day.

691
00:35:41,502 --> 00:35:43,335
Look, I work all day.

692
00:35:43,337 --> 00:35:45,270
I get a lot of stress
from my boss.

693
00:35:45,272 --> 00:35:47,205
I come home,
I just want to relax.

694
00:35:47,207 --> 00:35:48,506
Is that too much to ask?

695
00:35:48,508 --> 00:35:49,874
I mean, what do you think?

696
00:35:49,876 --> 00:35:52,443
What do I think?

697
00:35:52,445 --> 00:35:55,112
I think you two are so dang
lucky to have each other.

698
00:35:55,114 --> 00:35:57,180
Oh, I'm sure you might
fight over the dishes

699
00:35:57,182 --> 00:35:59,165
but at the end of the day...

700
00:35:59,166 --> 00:36:01,149
At least you're going
to be together.

701
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:02,217
Not like me.

702
00:36:02,219 --> 00:36:03,484
Not like me and trixie!

703
00:36:05,488 --> 00:36:07,421
Oh, I lost her!

704
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:10,590
Trixie!

705
00:36:12,493 --> 00:36:14,493
Oh, sweetheart!

706
00:36:14,495 --> 00:36:16,361
Oh, baby!

707
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:18,895
I'm okay.

708
00:36:20,231 --> 00:36:22,631
Oh...

709
00:36:31,874 --> 00:36:32,873
I feel better.

710
00:36:32,875 --> 00:36:34,507
He's good.

711
00:36:34,509 --> 00:36:35,608
Oh, trixie!

712
00:36:37,878 --> 00:36:39,878
Oh, come in.

713
00:36:42,616 --> 00:36:44,315
Huh?!

714
00:36:44,317 --> 00:36:46,483
Don't tell me you're getting
the band back together.

715
00:36:46,485 --> 00:36:48,485
Tennessee...

716
00:36:48,487 --> 00:36:50,620
We're getting the
band back together.

717
00:36:51,823 --> 00:36:53,522
Tennessee: I'm sorry, boys.

718
00:36:53,524 --> 00:36:55,457
I just can't play the thing

719
00:36:55,459 --> 00:36:57,592
not without trixie there. I...

720
00:36:57,594 --> 00:36:58,826
Why'd she break up with you?

721
00:36:58,828 --> 00:37:00,861
Was it that sweater
you're wearing?

722
00:37:00,863 --> 00:37:04,231
Took off with some rich,
millionaire, real estate guy.

723
00:37:04,233 --> 00:37:05,232
A panda!

724
00:37:07,051 --> 00:37:08,867
What's with the pandas?
They get everything.

725
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:10,669
You're telling me.

726
00:37:10,671 --> 00:37:12,203
You sure it wasn't
that sweater?

727
00:37:12,205 --> 00:37:13,270
Zeb! Huh?

728
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:14,271
If I knew where she was

729
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:15,705
I'd be there in a second.

730
00:37:15,707 --> 00:37:18,340
Ah, but even if I could play,
who'd come?

731
00:37:18,342 --> 00:37:20,942
Nobody cares
about the country bears no more.

732
00:37:20,944 --> 00:37:22,810
Nobody even knows who we are.

733
00:37:22,812 --> 00:37:25,212
Hey, how's everybody doing?

734
00:37:25,214 --> 00:37:26,880
Oh, my gosh.

735
00:37:26,882 --> 00:37:27,947
You're the country bears.

736
00:37:27,949 --> 00:37:29,949
Oh... you know who we are?

737
00:37:29,951 --> 00:37:33,385
Sure. You guys inspired me
to go after my dream

738
00:37:33,387 --> 00:37:34,419
to become a famous singer.

739
00:37:34,421 --> 00:37:35,753
Did you make it?

740
00:37:35,755 --> 00:37:37,287
Yeah, Fred, she made it.

741
00:37:37,289 --> 00:37:39,656
She just works here
for the free uniform.

742
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:42,224
Sorry, no offense.

743
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:43,225
None taken.

744
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:44,559
I'm still working on it.

745
00:37:44,561 --> 00:37:47,228
I even do one of your songs,
"kick it into gear."

746
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:49,196
¶ Kick it into gear ¶

747
00:37:49,198 --> 00:37:51,464
¶ sometimes you just got to... ¶

748
00:37:52,467 --> 00:37:53,466
That old thing?

749
00:37:53,468 --> 00:37:54,900
Blow the dust off that one.

750
00:37:54,902 --> 00:37:57,269
Well, I kind of got
my own arrangement.

751
00:37:57,271 --> 00:38:01,940
¶ Sometimes you just got
to kick it into gear. ¶

752
00:38:01,942 --> 00:38:02,941
Yeah.

753
00:38:02,943 --> 00:38:04,208
Yeah!

754
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:05,242
Hey, come on. Sing it!

755
00:38:05,244 --> 00:38:06,276
Come on!

756
00:38:10,482 --> 00:38:14,283
¶ When your grip keeps slippin'
and your clutch is gone ¶

757
00:38:16,687 --> 00:38:18,953
¶ And you're tired
of spinning your wheels ¶

758
00:38:18,955 --> 00:38:20,888
¶ on your brain's front lawn ¶

759
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:24,591
¶ ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh ¶

760
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:27,560
¶ well, keep your asphalt under,
sunny side up ¶

761
00:38:27,562 --> 00:38:30,596
¶ a gas credit card
and a giant coffee cup ¶

762
00:38:30,598 --> 00:38:34,299
¶ the rest of your life
is gonna find you here ¶

763
00:38:34,301 --> 00:38:36,534
¶ get up on the highway
and kick it into gear ¶

764
00:38:36,536 --> 00:38:40,471
¶ kick it into gear,
kick it into gear ¶

765
00:38:40,473 --> 00:38:43,440
¶ that's the only way you're
gonna get on out of here ¶

766
00:38:43,442 --> 00:38:45,442
¶ kick it into gear ¶

767
00:38:45,444 --> 00:38:46,876
¶ Kick it into gear ¶

768
00:38:46,878 --> 00:38:49,511
¶ sometimes you just got
to kick it into gear ¶

769
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:52,813
Hey, I kind of like this song.

770
00:38:52,815 --> 00:38:53,947
Yeah!

771
00:38:53,949 --> 00:38:55,315
Yeah!

772
00:38:55,317 --> 00:38:59,952
¶ Had some money
for a turbo drive ¶

773
00:38:59,954 --> 00:39:02,354
¶ ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh ¶

774
00:39:02,356 --> 00:39:04,689
¶ well, it ain't
the destination ¶

775
00:39:04,691 --> 00:39:07,258
¶ it's the ride, ride, ride ¶

776
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,426
¶ ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh ¶

777
00:39:09,428 --> 00:39:12,896
¶ put the heavy to the metal
and grab onto the road ¶

778
00:39:12,898 --> 00:39:15,865
¶ I hear your motor runnin',
it's about to explode ¶ yeah!

779
00:39:15,867 --> 00:39:20,536
¶ Still be waitin'
this time next year ¶

780
00:39:20,538 --> 00:39:22,671
¶ head on down the highway
and kick it into gear ¶

781
00:39:22,673 --> 00:39:25,607

784

¶ sometimes you just got
to kick it into gear ¶

785
00:39:39,286 --> 00:39:40,418
Oh!

786
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,787
Whoo!

787
00:39:47,559 --> 00:39:48,558
¶ Oh, yeah ¶

788
00:40:01,404 --> 00:40:04,304
¶ Kick it into gear,

789
00:40:04,306 --> 00:40:08,341

¶ Sometimes you just got
to kick it into gear. ¶

797
00:40:32,497 --> 00:40:33,729
Order up.

798
00:40:35,967 --> 00:40:37,566
So, how do you boys
like your eggs?

799
00:40:39,836 --> 00:40:41,035
Hot!

800
00:40:41,037 --> 00:40:42,036
Like us.

801
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:44,171
Yeah. Yeah.

802
00:40:44,173 --> 00:40:45,572
I guess people do remember us.

803
00:40:45,574 --> 00:40:46,973
Yeah.

804
00:40:46,975 --> 00:40:48,541
Yeah. Bears are even on TV.

805
00:40:48,543 --> 00:40:50,109
Anchorman:
Police believe this man...

806
00:40:50,111 --> 00:40:51,176
Hmm? Huh? What?

807
00:40:51,178 --> 00:40:52,911
...Is involved in the abduction

808
00:40:52,913 --> 00:40:54,178
of this ten-year-old boy.

809
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,913
That's you.

810
00:40:55,915 --> 00:40:58,115
Police also believe
his accomplices are

811
00:40:58,117 --> 00:41:00,183
this man, this man,
and this chicken

812
00:41:00,185 --> 00:41:01,918
who are all traveling
in this bus.

813
00:41:04,455 --> 00:41:06,955
We'll keep you updated
on bus watch!

814
00:41:06,957 --> 00:41:09,590
Oh, no!

815
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:10,757
You guys are kidnappers? Huh?

816
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:12,225
Of course not, zeb.

817
00:41:12,227 --> 00:41:17,029
Guys...
I think we have a problem.

818
00:41:17,031 --> 00:41:17,896
Hmm? Huh? Hmm?

819
00:41:18,832 --> 00:41:20,097
How many?

820
00:41:20,099 --> 00:41:21,498
Two, please.

821
00:41:23,735 --> 00:41:25,735
Right this way.

822
00:41:33,544 --> 00:41:35,143
Ah! Here you go.

823
00:41:38,715 --> 00:41:41,849
Suspicious activity at 2:00.

824
00:41:43,252 --> 00:41:45,118
How could you possibly
know that?

825
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,486
Look.

826
00:41:53,894 --> 00:41:55,059
Let's give 'em a...

827
00:41:55,061 --> 00:41:56,493
Let's go.

828
00:42:11,174 --> 00:42:14,975
¶ Gone in a breeze ¶

829
00:42:14,977 --> 00:42:16,242
¶ I keep blowing down
the road... ¶

830
00:42:16,244 --> 00:42:17,243
officer: Pull over.

831
00:42:17,245 --> 00:42:18,577
Pull over.

832
00:42:18,579 --> 00:42:20,111
Pull over immediately or...

833
00:42:20,113 --> 00:42:22,113
Uh... or...

834
00:42:22,115 --> 00:42:23,247
Or-or what?

835
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:24,915
Or we'll make you pull over.

836
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:26,016
Or we'll make you pull over.

837
00:42:26,018 --> 00:42:28,151
Shake these fellas.

838
00:42:28,153 --> 00:42:29,552
Shake 'em!

839
00:42:32,222 --> 00:42:34,789
¶ Gone in a breeze ¶

840
00:42:34,791 --> 00:42:37,825
¶ I keep blowing
down the road... ¶

841
00:42:40,929 --> 00:42:42,161
Whoa!

842
00:42:42,163 --> 00:42:43,929
¶ Well, now they're gone
in a breeze... ¶

843
00:42:43,931 --> 00:42:44,863
whoa.

844
00:42:45,832 --> 00:42:46,730
Whoa!

845
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,732
I'm scared.

846
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:51,900
All right, it's time
to lose these guys.

847
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:53,268
I need honey!

848
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:54,836
How about a little thing I call

849
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:56,170
"hiding in the car wash."

850
00:42:56,172 --> 00:42:57,304
Uh, how's that work?

851
00:42:57,306 --> 00:42:58,738
We hide in the car wash.

852
00:42:58,740 --> 00:42:59,739
Oh.

853
00:43:16,789 --> 00:43:19,256
Whoa.

854
00:43:19,258 --> 00:43:20,624
I lost them.

855
00:43:20,626 --> 00:43:22,158
What do you mean,
you lost them?

856
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,559
How do you lose a bus?

857
00:43:25,763 --> 00:43:26,862
Bingo. 9:00.

858
00:43:26,864 --> 00:43:30,165

Where'd they go?

873
00:43:59,255 --> 00:44:00,754
I don't know. I can't see them.

I can't see anything.
Can you see anything?

875
00:44:02,691 --> 00:44:04,090
No, I can't.
Put your window down.

876
00:44:04,092 --> 00:44:05,291
Do you think I should?

877
00:44:05,293 --> 00:44:07,826
Yeah, it's all right.
It's police business.

878
00:44:07,828 --> 00:44:09,277
Right.

911
00:45:16,708 --> 00:45:17,840
Oh! Oh! Ah!

912
00:45:17,842 --> 00:45:18,974
Whoa!

913
00:45:18,976 --> 00:45:20,875
Oh, my goodness, that's hot.

914
00:45:41,227 --> 00:45:42,359
Yeah!

915
00:45:42,361 --> 00:45:44,761
Yeah!

916
00:46:01,979 --> 00:46:03,378
Your hair.

917
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:06,748
Your hair looks ridiculous.

918
00:46:08,351 --> 00:46:09,350
My hair?

919
00:46:09,352 --> 00:46:11,085
Your... mustache.

920
00:46:11,087 --> 00:46:12,219
What about it?

921
00:46:12,221 --> 00:46:14,921
It was a fake?!

922
00:46:16,691 --> 00:46:18,957
You still got it, roadie!

923
00:46:20,093 --> 00:46:21,826
You, too, Mr. Chicken.

924
00:46:25,298 --> 00:46:26,997
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

925
00:46:26,999 --> 00:46:30,266
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

926
00:46:30,268 --> 00:46:33,035
Whoo-hoo!

927
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:46,448
Hey, Dex, it's me... beary.

928
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:50,051
Beary? You are in
so much trouble.

929
00:46:50,053 --> 00:46:51,819
It's kind of cool.

930
00:46:51,821 --> 00:46:54,288
Are mom and dad, uh...

931
00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:57,124
I mean,
Mr. And Mrs. Barrington there?

932
00:46:57,126 --> 00:47:00,427
No! They're out looking
for you, doofus.

933
00:47:00,429 --> 00:47:05,364
Oh, well, tell them I haven't
been kidnapped or anything

934
00:47:05,366 --> 00:47:07,366
and I'm okay.

935
00:47:07,368 --> 00:47:09,901
I figured out my higher purpose.

936
00:47:09,903 --> 00:47:11,502
I'm getting
the country bears back together

937
00:47:11,504 --> 00:47:14,304
for a concert on Saturday
at country bear hall.

938
00:47:14,306 --> 00:47:15,905
No, you're not.

939
00:47:15,907 --> 00:47:17,840
I don't care if you don't
believe me, but it's true.

940
00:47:17,842 --> 00:47:21,310
I just wanted them to know
that I was okay.

941
00:47:21,312 --> 00:47:23,278
Okay, you know, fine.

942
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:26,247
Just...
When are you coming home?

943
00:47:26,249 --> 00:47:28,315
I'm not.

944
00:47:28,317 --> 00:47:30,050
You're right, Dex.

945
00:47:30,052 --> 00:47:31,985
I got to face facts.

946
00:47:31,987 --> 00:47:33,519
We're different.

947
00:47:33,521 --> 00:47:35,888
I don't belong there.

948
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:37,289
I never did.

949
00:47:37,291 --> 00:47:40,825
Beary, what are you
talking about?

950
00:47:40,827 --> 00:47:43,193
Dex, you can keep my game boy.

951
00:47:45,163 --> 00:47:46,295
Beary?

952
00:47:48,966 --> 00:47:50,900
Look, you're part of...

953
00:47:56,407 --> 00:47:58,340
So long, country bears!

954
00:47:59,476 --> 00:48:01,142
Whoa! What the...?

955
00:48:01,144 --> 00:48:02,443
Look, he's shooting
a ray gun at us.

956
00:48:02,445 --> 00:48:03,944
Come on. Let's run.

957
00:48:06,447 --> 00:48:08,046
Fred, your harmonica

958
00:48:08,048 --> 00:48:10,281
might disrupt
the aliens' brain waves.

959
00:48:10,283 --> 00:48:11,315
Blow. Blow, Fred, blow!

960
00:48:12,384 --> 00:48:13,983
Ah! That noise!

961
00:48:16,053 --> 00:48:17,919
All: Bear power!

962
00:48:22,391 --> 00:48:24,424
That was bad.

963
00:48:32,666 --> 00:48:36,000
"Appearing tonight:
Trixie St. Claire"?

964
00:48:36,002 --> 00:48:37,134
Oh, man!

965
00:48:38,203 --> 00:48:39,468
Tennessee!

966
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:42,304
Tennessee, remember
when you said

967
00:48:42,306 --> 00:48:45,140
you'd do anything
to find trixie?

968
00:48:45,142 --> 00:48:46,541
To get her back?

969
00:48:46,543 --> 00:48:48,142
Well, guess what?

970
00:48:49,545 --> 00:48:50,911
Oh...

971
00:48:56,618 --> 00:48:57,950
Thank you...

972
00:49:01,388 --> 00:49:03,521
...for not listening.

973
00:49:04,590 --> 00:49:05,689
Uh, well, I am.

974
00:49:07,225 --> 00:49:08,457
Tennessee!

975
00:49:08,459 --> 00:49:10,592
Uh...

976
00:49:10,594 --> 00:49:13,361
Guys, listen up.

977
00:49:13,363 --> 00:49:15,596
This next song was written

978
00:49:15,598 --> 00:49:17,998
by an old friend of mine.

979
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,634
He wrote it a long time ago
when he was my...

980
00:49:23,471 --> 00:49:27,339
...in a band
called the country bears.

981
00:49:27,341 --> 00:49:28,540
Whoo-hoo!

982
00:49:28,542 --> 00:49:29,707
Bears rock!

983
00:49:32,011 --> 00:49:38,281
¶ Did I lose your love
a long time ago? ¶

984
00:49:38,283 --> 00:49:41,117
¶ did I just wear it out? ¶

985
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,953
¶ baby, I don't know... ¶

986
00:49:50,059 --> 00:49:52,192
Oh, trixie, I'm all

987
00:49:52,194 --> 00:49:55,028
a mess on account
of how much I miss you.

988
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:56,029
I know...

989
00:49:56,031 --> 00:49:57,597
Tennessee...

990
00:50:01,536 --> 00:50:04,603
Ah...

991
00:50:12,278 --> 00:50:15,379
¶ 'Cause it seems like anymore ¶

992
00:50:15,381 --> 00:50:18,382
¶ we're not on the same page ¶

993
00:50:18,384 --> 00:50:20,650
¶ in the same book ¶

994
00:50:20,652 --> 00:50:24,253
¶ or on the same stage ¶

995
00:50:24,255 --> 00:50:30,091
¶ don't look at me
like I'm a stranger now ¶

996
00:50:30,093 --> 00:50:32,426
¶ have I changed that much? ¶

997
00:50:32,428 --> 00:50:35,762
¶ baby, tell me how ¶

998
00:50:35,764 --> 00:50:40,333
¶ we said forever
and always for good... ¶

999
00:50:42,403 --> 00:50:44,703
Oh, stop your blubbering, Fred.

1000
00:50:44,705 --> 00:50:46,037
I'm sorry.

1001
00:50:46,039 --> 00:50:49,240
¶ Can love stand the test ¶

1002
00:50:49,242 --> 00:50:52,243
¶ of time that surrounds us? ¶

1003
00:50:52,245 --> 00:50:57,314
¶ moments that astound us? ¶

1004
00:50:57,316 --> 00:51:00,216
¶ can love stand the test ¶

1005
00:51:00,218 --> 00:51:03,786
¶ of time that surrounds us ¶

1006
00:51:03,788 --> 00:51:06,388
¶ moments that astound us ¶

1007
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:09,757
¶ joy and happiness ¶

1008
00:51:11,293 --> 00:51:15,461
¶ joy and happiness ¶

1009
00:51:17,565 --> 00:51:23,201
¶ joy and happiness. ¶

1010
00:51:31,677 --> 00:51:34,511
I think we just got Tennessee.

1011
00:51:34,513 --> 00:51:36,246
They're great.

1012
00:51:36,248 --> 00:51:38,214
They were always great.

1013
00:51:38,216 --> 00:51:40,649
Better than the eagles.

1014
00:51:47,257 --> 00:51:48,522
Yeah?

1015
00:51:48,524 --> 00:51:50,090
Henry: Uh, uh, yeah, uh...

1016
00:51:50,092 --> 00:51:51,257
Hello?

1017
00:51:51,259 --> 00:51:54,226
Ted? Ted, it's, uh, it's Henry.

1018
00:51:55,295 --> 00:51:56,327
Henry Taylor?

1019
00:51:56,329 --> 00:52:00,064
What do you want, Henry?

1020
00:52:00,066 --> 00:52:02,299
Yeah, well, uh,
well, Ted, look, uh

1021
00:52:02,301 --> 00:52:07,370
I'm sort of in a bind here,
and, uh, I was, uh, well...

1022
00:52:07,372 --> 00:52:09,672
Hey, hey, this is exciting!

1023
00:52:09,674 --> 00:52:13,142
Uh, we're getting the band back
together for a benefit show.

1024
00:52:14,545 --> 00:52:15,810
Great, huh?

1025
00:52:15,812 --> 00:52:19,446
What? Get the...
Get the band back together?

1026
00:52:19,448 --> 00:52:20,580
Yeah-huh.

1027
00:52:21,816 --> 00:52:23,549
I'm going in a tunnel.
I'm losing you.

1028
00:52:27,087 --> 00:52:29,520
Okay, Ted, good,
thank you very much.

1029
00:52:31,624 --> 00:52:33,090
Well?

1030
00:52:33,092 --> 00:52:35,859
Oh, he's in.

1031
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:38,328
¶ ¶

1032
00:52:51,107 --> 00:52:54,541
Whoo-eee! Razzle-dazzle!

1033
00:52:54,543 --> 00:52:57,410
Looks like old Ted's done
pretty good for hisself.

1034
00:52:57,412 --> 00:52:59,112
Fred: Yeah.

1035
00:52:59,113 --> 00:53:00,813
Why don't you just borrow
the $20,000 from him, man?

1036
00:53:00,815 --> 00:53:02,748
Fred: It don't look
like he'd miss it much.

1037
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:03,749
Henry: Okay, guys

1038
00:53:03,751 --> 00:53:05,250
now, one thing at a time, okay?

1039
00:53:05,252 --> 00:53:06,517
Just one thing at a time.

1040
00:53:06,519 --> 00:53:08,118
Got to do everything here.

1041
00:53:09,154 --> 00:53:10,653
All right.

1042
00:53:10,655 --> 00:53:13,622
Hello? Hello, we're looking
for a Ted bedderhead.

1043
00:53:13,624 --> 00:53:16,791
Uh, two orders of French
fries and a shake.

1044
00:53:18,394 --> 00:53:19,526
Fred...

1045
00:53:19,528 --> 00:53:21,127
What?

1046
00:53:21,129 --> 00:53:22,795
Oh!

1047
00:53:22,797 --> 00:53:25,531
Uh, excuse me?

1048
00:53:25,533 --> 00:53:27,199
Excuse me?

1049
00:53:36,642 --> 00:53:37,874
Can I help you?

1050
00:53:37,876 --> 00:53:39,408
Uh, yeah. Uh, Ted bedderhead?

1051
00:53:39,410 --> 00:53:41,309
He's, uh, an old friend
of mine, um...

1052
00:53:42,645 --> 00:53:43,910
Is he here?

1053
00:53:43,912 --> 00:53:45,578
No, he's, uh, not here.

1054
00:53:45,579 --> 00:53:47,245
He's probably still at the
country club at the wedding.

1055
00:53:47,248 --> 00:53:48,847
Oh, yeah, country club.

1056
00:53:48,849 --> 00:53:50,615
Well, thank you.

1057
00:53:50,617 --> 00:53:52,850
You're the country bears, right?

1058
00:53:52,852 --> 00:53:54,418
Um... yeah. Yeah!

1059
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:55,919
Well, I'm, uh...
Yeah, yeah, I know...

1060
00:53:55,921 --> 00:53:57,720
you're a big, big fan...
we get it all the time...

1061
00:53:57,722 --> 00:53:59,788
and that's real nice, young man,
but, uh, we got to run.

1062
00:53:59,790 --> 00:54:00,922
Thank you very much.

1063
00:54:00,924 --> 00:54:02,256
Come on, beary.

1064
00:54:02,258 --> 00:54:04,258
Come on, beary. Bye.

1065
00:54:06,795 --> 00:54:08,594
That guy looks a lot
like Elton John.

1066
00:54:08,596 --> 00:54:10,929
Nah, Elton John's taller.

1067
00:54:15,334 --> 00:54:17,300
Keep your eyes open
for some clues.

1068
00:54:17,302 --> 00:54:18,668
Uh-huh.

1069
00:54:18,670 --> 00:54:20,536
Uh, give me a minute, huh?

1070
00:54:24,741 --> 00:54:26,273
Yeah.

1071
00:54:28,176 --> 00:54:29,841
How's it look?

1072
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:36,547
I'll find a mirror.

1073
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:44,821
Henry: Ted may be a little
surprised to see us

1074
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:47,757
so, uh, let me do the talking,
all right?

1075
00:54:47,759 --> 00:54:50,392
Fred: I thought you said
he knew we was coming.

1076
00:54:50,394 --> 00:54:52,527
Henry: Well, he does, but...

1077
00:54:52,529 --> 00:54:55,830
Let's not embarrass him
in front of his rich friends.

1078
00:54:55,832 --> 00:54:57,832
It wasn't me.
It was the chicken.

1079
00:54:57,834 --> 00:54:59,333
Henry: Come on, Fred.

1080
00:54:59,335 --> 00:55:00,400
Let's find your brother.

1081
00:55:00,402 --> 00:55:01,667
Uh... yeah, my brother, um...

1082
00:55:01,669 --> 00:55:03,268
Uh-huh.

1083
00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:04,669
I'm going to go get
something to eat first.

1084
00:55:04,671 --> 00:55:07,338
What? Yeah, eat first.

1085
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:09,973
Right behind you, big guy.

1086
00:55:14,646 --> 00:55:17,446
¶ Shake it, shake it ¶

1087
00:55:17,448 --> 00:55:20,315
¶ shake your groove thing,
shake your groove thing ¶

1088
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:22,418
¶ yeah, yeah ¶

1089
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:24,353
uh, maybe he's not here.

1090
00:55:24,355 --> 00:55:26,988
¶ Shake your groove thing,

1091
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:27,989

1092
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:29,857

¶ Show 'em how we do it now,

1094
00:55:33,863 --> 00:55:35,863
how do?

1095
00:55:35,865 --> 00:55:37,865
Your hair is very purty.

1096
00:55:37,867 --> 00:55:39,900
Nice shade of blue. Mm-hmm.

1097
00:55:39,902 --> 00:55:41,935
Like a whale's belly. Yeah.

1098
00:55:41,937 --> 00:55:43,069
You, too.

1099
00:55:43,071 --> 00:55:44,737
Bye-bye, now.

1100
00:55:45,873 --> 00:55:47,372
¶ We do more out on the floor ¶

1101
00:55:48,541 --> 00:55:50,908
¶ Groovin' loose

1102

¶ We put in motion... ¶

1103
00:55:53,612 --> 00:55:57,380
no, no, no, no, no!

1104
00:55:57,382 --> 00:55:59,515
Hey, there, uh...

1105
00:55:59,517 --> 00:56:02,050
¶ Shake your groove thing,
shake your groove thing... ¶

1106
00:56:02,052 --> 00:56:03,351
...Ted.

1107
00:56:03,353 --> 00:56:05,553
What are you doing here, Henry?

1108
00:56:05,555 --> 00:56:06,587
Uh, well...

1109
00:56:06,589 --> 00:56:08,522
Wow! Ted bedderhead!

1110
00:56:10,459 --> 00:56:11,758
I'm such a big fan.

1111
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,025
Oh, I think it's great

1112
00:56:13,027 --> 00:56:14,626
you're going to
play in the show

1113
00:56:14,628 --> 00:56:15,893
and save country bear hall.

1114
00:56:15,895 --> 00:56:17,761
Play in the show?

1115
00:56:17,763 --> 00:56:19,362
Henry?!

1116
00:56:19,364 --> 00:56:21,063
Henry: No, no, no.

1117
00:56:21,065 --> 00:56:24,833
Well, we just thought we'd
drop by and see if we all...

1118
00:56:24,835 --> 00:56:26,868
We all?

1119
00:56:26,870 --> 00:56:27,902
They're here?

1120
00:56:27,904 --> 00:56:29,370
Uh, uh...

1121
00:56:29,372 --> 00:56:30,504
Oh, yeah.

1122
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:32,639
¶ Burn, baby, burn ¶

1123
00:56:32,641 --> 00:56:34,007
¶ disco inferno,

1124
00:56:34,009 --> 00:56:35,875
I just... but...
¶ burn that mother down... ¶

1125
00:56:35,877 --> 00:56:38,978
so the bear said, "you going to
kill that before you eat it?"

1126
00:56:40,982 --> 00:56:42,581
You guys!

1127
00:56:42,583 --> 00:56:44,149
You, out!

1128
00:56:44,151 --> 00:56:45,683
Come on, now.

1129
00:56:45,685 --> 00:56:46,884
Hello, Ted.

1130
00:56:46,886 --> 00:56:48,852
Hello, brother. Out!

1131
00:56:48,854 --> 00:56:49,886
Out!

1132
00:56:49,888 --> 00:56:51,988
O-okay. All right.

1133
00:56:51,990 --> 00:56:53,823
Sorry, ma'am, I... Oh, geez.

1134
00:56:53,825 --> 00:56:55,491
Get outta here. Come on.

1135
00:56:55,493 --> 00:56:57,759
What, what, what
what makes you think

1136
00:56:57,761 --> 00:57:00,495
I'd get back together
with you guys?

1137
00:57:00,497 --> 00:57:01,896
Uh...?

1138
00:57:01,898 --> 00:57:03,163
Hey, look...

1139
00:57:03,165 --> 00:57:05,031
That's where I started out.

1140
00:57:05,033 --> 00:57:06,599
I'm not going back.

1141
00:57:06,601 --> 00:57:08,934
When I said I was finished,
I meant it.

1142
00:57:08,936 --> 00:57:10,402
I'm finished.

1143
00:57:10,404 --> 00:57:11,803
But, Mr. Bedderhead

1144
00:57:11,805 --> 00:57:12,770
we... Kid...

1145
00:57:12,772 --> 00:57:14,471
We need everyone

1146
00:57:14,473 --> 00:57:16,606
to make this happen,
and we need you.

1147
00:57:16,608 --> 00:57:18,608
Now, listen, kid...

1148
00:57:18,610 --> 00:57:20,843
Uh, uh... who is this guy?

1149
00:57:21,846 --> 00:57:23,478
All: That's beary.

1150
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:25,012
Uh, no, no, no.

1151
00:57:25,014 --> 00:57:27,948
That was a long time ago, kid.

1152
00:57:27,950 --> 00:57:29,482
Things change.

1153
00:57:29,484 --> 00:57:33,018
Frankly, your little
nostalgic field trip

1154
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:34,786
you know, is kind of pathetic.

1155
00:57:34,788 --> 00:57:38,456
Well, maybe it was.

1156
00:57:38,458 --> 00:57:40,858
Sorry to have
bothered you, Ted.

1157
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:41,959
People are waiting for me.

1158
00:57:41,961 --> 00:57:43,460
You found your way in.

1159
00:57:43,462 --> 00:57:45,829
You can find your way out.

1160
00:57:45,831 --> 00:57:48,164
Hmm!

1161
00:57:48,166 --> 00:57:50,499
That guy's
turned into a real...

1162
00:57:52,736 --> 00:57:55,603
I'm going to go get the bus.

1163
00:57:55,605 --> 00:57:57,871
My mistake, everyone.

1164
00:57:57,873 --> 00:58:00,139
Don't know what I was thinking.

1165
00:58:00,141 --> 00:58:03,142
It's not your fault,
Henry. It's mine.

1166
00:58:03,144 --> 00:58:04,610
This whole thing was my idea.

1167
00:58:04,612 --> 00:58:06,211
No, no, now, it's
nobody's fault.

1168
00:58:06,213 --> 00:58:08,613
But it might as well be mine!

1169
00:58:08,615 --> 00:58:10,114
Why don't you just...?

1170
00:58:10,116 --> 00:58:11,515
Tennessee...

1171
00:58:11,517 --> 00:58:15,685
Right. Come on, Fred.

1172
00:58:23,894 --> 00:58:26,995
This ain't right.

1173
00:58:33,536 --> 00:58:35,568
¶ Ba-da-da-da-da ¶

1174
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:40,839

1176
00:58:45,645 --> 00:58:49,579
¶ It's not unusual

1177
00:58:50,982 --> 00:58:55,651

You... you're a wedding singer?

00:59:15,269 --> 00:59:17,068
Yeah.

1183
00:59:17,070 --> 00:59:19,270
This... this ain't your party?

1184
00:59:19,272 --> 00:59:20,871
Nope.

1185
00:59:20,873 --> 00:59:23,206
So, you're not rich?

1186
00:59:23,208 --> 00:59:24,273
Yeah.

1187
00:59:24,275 --> 00:59:26,608
And you still
won't play with us?

1188
00:59:26,610 --> 00:59:27,709
Nope.

1189
00:59:27,711 --> 00:59:29,610
I'm not goin'.

1190
00:59:29,612 --> 00:59:34,147
Aw, Ted, you don't
gotta lie to us.

1191
00:59:34,149 --> 00:59:36,015
You're family.

1192
00:59:36,017 --> 00:59:38,117
And you're going.

1193
00:59:40,955 --> 00:59:42,988
Officer hamm: When the kidnappers
call to make their demands

1194
00:59:42,990 --> 00:59:44,289
we just agree
with whatever they say.

1195
00:59:44,291 --> 00:59:46,758
I already told you guys
he hasn't been kidnapped.

1196
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:48,159
He's with the country bears.

1197
00:59:48,161 --> 00:59:49,894
Listen to me, son

1198
00:59:49,896 --> 00:59:51,896
you can be sure that they're
going to be keeping him

1199
00:59:51,898 --> 00:59:53,564
in some creepy underground lair

1200
00:59:53,566 --> 00:59:55,566
high up in the building until
they get their ransom, okay?

1201
00:59:55,568 --> 00:59:57,034
Would you guys listen to me?

1202
00:59:57,036 --> 00:59:58,969
There's not going
to be any ransom.

1203
00:59:58,971 --> 01:00:00,670
He's with the country bears.

1204
01:00:00,672 --> 01:00:02,605
They're doing a concert
tonight...

1205
01:00:02,607 --> 01:00:03,839
At country bear hall.

1206
01:00:03,841 --> 01:00:06,007
They just said that
to distract you

1207
01:00:06,009 --> 01:00:07,875
sports fan. Besides...

1208
01:00:07,877 --> 01:00:09,943
The country bears back together?

1209
01:00:11,079 --> 01:00:12,978
Son, listen, leave
the police work

1210
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:14,679
to the professionals, okay?

1211
01:00:14,681 --> 01:00:17,748
Sure. Just... tell me
when they get here.

1212
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:19,116
Good kid.

1213
01:00:19,118 --> 01:00:20,884
He's a keeper. Yeah.

1214
01:00:20,886 --> 01:00:26,222
Ted: All these years, I haven't
been able to face you guys.

1215
01:00:26,224 --> 01:00:28,257
I pretty much lost everything.

1216
01:00:28,259 --> 01:00:31,627
So I been trying
to make a buck.

1217
01:00:31,629 --> 01:00:33,695
Singing at weddings
and stuff like that.

1218
01:00:33,697 --> 01:00:36,631
Well, at least you're not doing
children's birthday parties.

1219
01:00:38,735 --> 01:00:40,167
Well, uh, I am.

1220
01:00:40,169 --> 01:00:41,601
All: Really?

1221
01:00:42,870 --> 01:00:45,704
But we saw your house...
Your gardener.

1222
01:00:45,706 --> 01:00:49,207
That's not my gardener.
That's Elton John.

1223
01:00:49,209 --> 01:00:50,208
Told ya.

1224
01:00:50,210 --> 01:00:51,609
I rent a room

1225
01:00:51,611 --> 01:00:52,810
over the garage from him.

1226
01:00:52,812 --> 01:00:55,045
Well, now, brother, that's okay

1227
01:00:55,047 --> 01:00:57,280
'cause we's all together again.

1228
01:00:57,282 --> 01:00:59,148
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1229
01:00:59,150 --> 01:01:00,782
Just 'cause I'm telling
the truth

1230
01:01:00,784 --> 01:01:01,916
doesn't mean I'm dumb.

1231
01:01:01,918 --> 01:01:02,783
Huh?

1232
01:01:02,785 --> 01:01:04,885
Roadie, stop the bus.

1233
01:01:04,887 --> 01:01:08,054
Ted: Okay, have you rehearsed?

1234
01:01:08,056 --> 01:01:09,622
What songs you gonna to do?

1235
01:01:09,624 --> 01:01:11,123
Who's doing sound?

1236
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:14,793
Tennessee: Well, we ain't exactly
figured all that out yet, Ted.

1237
01:01:14,795 --> 01:01:16,895
Ted: Same old country bears.

1238
01:01:16,897 --> 01:01:19,097
Zeb: Come on, Ted. You
do kind of owe us.

1239
01:01:19,099 --> 01:01:21,332
I mean, you were
the reason we broke up.

1240
01:01:22,702 --> 01:01:25,269
Well! There it is.
Knew that was coming up.

1241
01:01:25,271 --> 01:01:27,738
I'm the reason
we stayed together, zeb.

1242
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:28,772
Did any of you...

1243
01:01:28,774 --> 01:01:31,741
any of you... ever thank me?

1244
01:01:31,743 --> 01:01:33,876
We all had our jobs to do, Ted.

1245
01:01:33,878 --> 01:01:34,743
Uh-huh.

1246
01:01:34,745 --> 01:01:36,344
Oh, right. Drinkin'...

1247
01:01:37,213 --> 01:01:37,933
Blubberin', and...

1248
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:39,779
Starin' into space.

1249
01:01:39,781 --> 01:01:40,780
Hey! Huh?

1250
01:01:40,782 --> 01:01:42,148
What we were...

1251
01:01:42,150 --> 01:01:43,782
Was years ago.

1252
01:01:43,784 --> 01:01:45,617
Blubberin'? Uh, uh...

1253
01:01:45,619 --> 01:01:47,752
Well, you were blubberin'.

1254
01:01:47,754 --> 01:01:49,153
Hey? Okay, there.

1255
01:01:50,156 --> 01:01:51,188
Guys! Hey, hey, guys!

1256
01:01:52,624 --> 01:01:53,823
Guys!

1257
01:01:53,825 --> 01:01:56,125
You know, in people magazine,
April 1983

1258
01:01:56,127 --> 01:01:58,994
you all said that
the bears was your family.

1259
01:01:58,996 --> 01:02:00,328
And like a family...

1260
01:02:00,330 --> 01:02:03,331
Kid, that's just a bunch
of meaningless publicity.

1261
01:02:03,333 --> 01:02:05,266
You don't know nothing about

1262
01:02:05,268 --> 01:02:07,201
the real bears, understand?

1263
01:02:07,203 --> 01:02:08,835
Nothin'!

1264
01:02:08,837 --> 01:02:11,304
We are not a family.

1265
01:02:11,306 --> 01:02:14,040
You're right.

1266
01:02:14,042 --> 01:02:17,176
This isn't a family.

1267
01:02:17,178 --> 01:02:20,879
'Cause the people who love you
no matter what?

1268
01:02:20,881 --> 01:02:22,647
That's your family.

1269
01:02:24,117 --> 01:02:26,884
Who told you that, beary?

1270
01:02:26,886 --> 01:02:28,752
My dad.

1271
01:02:34,058 --> 01:02:36,358
My dad.

1272
01:02:42,299 --> 01:02:44,165
Wh... wh... hold on, beary.

1273
01:02:56,312 --> 01:03:00,013
¶ ¶

1274
01:03:30,307 --> 01:03:33,007
Mom?

1275
01:03:33,009 --> 01:03:35,143
Beary.

1276
01:03:39,849 --> 01:03:42,482
Beary!

1277
01:03:42,484 --> 01:03:45,952
Beary, beary, beary! Oh!
There's my good boy!

1278
01:03:45,954 --> 01:03:48,054
Are you all right?
Did they hurt you?

1279
01:03:48,056 --> 01:03:49,221
Did they brainwash you?

1280
01:03:49,223 --> 01:03:51,056
How many fingers
am I holding up?

1281
01:03:51,058 --> 01:03:52,891
I'm fine, mom.

1282
01:03:52,893 --> 01:03:54,125
Oh, honey.

1283
01:03:54,127 --> 01:03:55,126
Norbert! Norbert!

1284
01:03:55,128 --> 01:03:57,828
Yeah, hon, what is it?

1285
01:03:57,830 --> 01:03:59,563
Hi, dad.

1286
01:03:59,565 --> 01:04:02,098
Oh! Beary!

1287
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:04,400
Oh, beary, beary

1288
01:04:04,402 --> 01:04:06,068
my beary boy! Oh!

1289
01:04:09,139 --> 01:04:10,838
Hey, doofus.

1290
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:12,005
Hey, Dex.

1291
01:04:12,007 --> 01:04:14,239
Look who's home.

1292
01:04:16,509 --> 01:04:17,541
Come here!

1293
01:04:24,515 --> 01:04:26,982
Aw, beary left his stuff.

1294
01:04:26,984 --> 01:04:29,017
Hmm...

1295
01:04:30,186 --> 01:04:33,854
"My hero," by beary barrington,
fourth grade.

1296
01:04:33,856 --> 01:04:36,356
"My hero is really heroes

1297
01:04:36,358 --> 01:04:40,126
"and my heroes
are the country bears.

1298
01:04:41,229 --> 01:04:43,462
"Whenever I'm sad.

1299
01:04:43,464 --> 01:04:45,397
"I play one of their songs

1300
01:04:45,399 --> 01:04:48,299
"and I forget why
I was even sad at all.

1301
01:04:48,301 --> 01:04:50,301
"And if you'd met my brother

1302
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:52,569
you'd know why
I was always sad."

1303
01:04:52,571 --> 01:04:54,237
Hmm.

1304
01:04:54,239 --> 01:04:58,441
"I can't really say zeb
is my hero, or Fred, or Ted

1305
01:04:58,443 --> 01:05:00,009
or even Tennessee."

1306
01:05:00,011 --> 01:05:03,912
"But as the country bears,
what they can do together

1307
01:05:03,914 --> 01:05:06,915
makes them my heroes."

1308
01:05:08,218 --> 01:05:11,385
"I'd like to meet them someday.

1309
01:05:11,387 --> 01:05:13,353
That would be cool."

1310
01:05:14,389 --> 01:05:15,988
It says here

1311
01:05:15,990 --> 01:05:22,594
"a+, but is everything
about the country bears?"

1312
01:05:22,596 --> 01:05:23,962
Hey.

1313
01:05:23,964 --> 01:05:25,496
Beary's a sharp little guy.

1314
01:05:25,498 --> 01:05:26,997
This morning he told me

1315
01:05:26,999 --> 01:05:28,965
something else.

1316
01:05:28,967 --> 01:05:31,901
Mr. Chicken... is a girl.

1317
01:05:36,406 --> 01:05:40,374
It's a pretty straightforward
demolition, Mr. Thimple.

1318
01:05:40,376 --> 01:05:41,641
Take about

1319
01:05:41,643 --> 01:05:44,577
a half hour to bulldoze her
to the ground.

1320
01:05:44,579 --> 01:05:47,112
Oh, yes... do that.

1321
01:05:58,656 --> 01:06:00,489
Mom: Dex, honey,
would you get that?

1322
01:06:00,491 --> 01:06:01,990
Okay.

1323
01:06:01,992 --> 01:06:04,125
And tell beary to come
down for some pie.

1324
01:06:04,127 --> 01:06:06,327
Beary! Pie!

1325
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:20,372
Dex: Uh... beary?

1326
01:06:20,374 --> 01:06:22,507
Hey. That Ted guy is here.

1327
01:06:22,509 --> 01:06:24,976
You want me to kick him out?

1328
01:06:24,978 --> 01:06:27,478
Ted? Ted bedderhead

1329
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:28,979
is here?

1330
01:06:28,981 --> 01:06:30,313
Yeah.

1331
01:06:37,522 --> 01:06:42,224
You, uh, you left your stuff
on the bus.

1332
01:06:42,226 --> 01:06:43,592
You can keep it.

1333
01:06:43,594 --> 01:06:45,160
I don't want it.

1334
01:06:45,162 --> 01:06:49,997
Um, look, I, uh... mm...

1335
01:06:49,999 --> 01:06:53,133
I hope you know
how lucky you are.

1336
01:06:53,135 --> 01:06:57,737
It only took you three days
to understand something

1337
01:06:57,739 --> 01:07:00,706
that took me ten years
to figure out.

1338
01:07:00,708 --> 01:07:02,340
What's that?

1339
01:07:02,342 --> 01:07:06,210
Mr. Chicken is a girl.

1340
01:07:06,212 --> 01:07:07,978
What?

1341
01:07:09,214 --> 01:07:11,113
I got ya.

1342
01:07:12,249 --> 01:07:17,384
Really, I want to tell you
that I'm sorry.

1343
01:07:17,386 --> 01:07:20,086
I was mad...

1344
01:07:20,088 --> 01:07:23,589
not at you... and I'm sorry.

1345
01:07:23,591 --> 01:07:26,158
And that thing you wrote
in your journal about us

1346
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:27,659
being great

1347
01:07:27,661 --> 01:07:29,661
when we're together?

1348
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:30,662
It's true.

1349
01:07:32,399 --> 01:07:34,232
You're going to do the show?

1350
01:07:34,234 --> 01:07:37,200
Nah, we're not doing the show.

1351
01:07:39,170 --> 01:07:42,671
Not without you.

1352
01:07:42,673 --> 01:07:45,440
Whoo-hoo!

1353
01:07:45,442 --> 01:07:47,275
Y'all come with me.

1354
01:07:47,277 --> 01:07:50,378
We can all ride together
on the...

1355
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:51,645
Bus? Bus?

1356
01:07:51,647 --> 01:07:53,079
The bus was stolen.

1357
01:07:53,081 --> 01:07:54,713
It was that thimple fella.

1358
01:07:56,516 --> 01:07:58,182
Come on, move along.
Move it. Come on.

1359
01:07:58,184 --> 01:07:59,383
What are you waiting for?

1360
01:07:59,385 --> 01:08:00,717
Thimple, I'm definitely
changing banks.

1361
01:08:00,719 --> 01:08:02,085
Oh, pooh.

1362
01:08:02,087 --> 01:08:04,353
I hate it
when we lose a customer.

1363
01:08:04,355 --> 01:08:05,520
We have to find them.

1364
01:08:05,522 --> 01:08:07,221
They have to do that show.

1365
01:08:07,223 --> 01:08:08,322
Beary, beary.

1366
01:08:08,324 --> 01:08:10,757
Your stuff was on
that bus, right?

1367
01:08:10,759 --> 01:08:11,758
Yeah.

1368
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:13,092
All your stuff?

1369
01:08:20,033 --> 01:08:21,298
We can track them with this.

1370
01:08:21,300 --> 01:08:22,432
Yeah.

1371
01:08:22,434 --> 01:08:24,600
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

1372
01:08:26,470 --> 01:08:27,469
All right.

1373
01:08:27,471 --> 01:08:29,437
Okay, in you go, big boy.

1374
01:08:30,606 --> 01:08:32,305
Hey, hey, hey, no, no.

1375
01:08:32,307 --> 01:08:33,372
Stop!

1376
01:08:33,374 --> 01:08:35,807
I have a better idea.

1377
01:08:43,115 --> 01:08:45,648
Whoa.

1378
01:08:45,650 --> 01:08:47,616
Easy, captain.

1379
01:08:48,585 --> 01:08:51,218
Thimple: Go on. Get in there!

1380
01:08:51,220 --> 01:08:52,385
Get in there!

1381
01:08:52,387 --> 01:08:54,787
Why are you doing this?

1382
01:08:54,789 --> 01:08:56,789
I can't have that show.

1383
01:08:56,791 --> 01:08:58,657
I can't have you ruin

1384
01:08:58,659 --> 01:09:02,093
what I've been working on
for 30 years.

1385
01:09:02,095 --> 01:09:03,694
30 years!

1386
01:09:03,696 --> 01:09:04,695
Which way?

1387
01:09:04,697 --> 01:09:07,164
Just, uh... go straight.

1388
01:09:08,267 --> 01:09:09,766
Okay, take a right.

1389
01:09:09,768 --> 01:09:10,633
Take a right here.

1390
01:09:10,635 --> 01:09:12,101
Whoa! Whoa!

1391
01:09:12,103 --> 01:09:13,669
Oh, oh, whoa!

1392
01:09:19,808 --> 01:09:22,708
Whoa, my kidneys.

1393
01:09:22,710 --> 01:09:24,376
Henry: What's the problem, bub?

1394
01:09:24,378 --> 01:09:25,777
You ruined my life.

1395
01:09:25,779 --> 01:09:28,780
Well, it's not our fault
you became a banker.

1396
01:09:28,782 --> 01:09:30,214
Not that.

1397
01:09:30,216 --> 01:09:31,615
What are you talking about?

1398
01:09:31,617 --> 01:09:33,383
This!

1399
01:09:34,786 --> 01:09:36,085
Huh?

1400
01:09:37,088 --> 01:09:38,087
What's he doing?

1401
01:09:38,089 --> 01:09:39,088
Uh-uh.

1402
01:09:39,090 --> 01:09:41,090
Zeb: What are you doing?

1403
01:09:41,092 --> 01:09:42,691
Wh-what's he doing?

1404
01:09:44,394 --> 01:09:46,227
Huh?

1405
01:09:47,496 --> 01:09:48,628
This:

1406
01:10:03,443 --> 01:10:05,242
Henry: Oh, my word!

1407
01:10:05,244 --> 01:10:07,110
You're Benny bogswaggle!

1408
01:10:07,112 --> 01:10:09,145
The armpit farter.

1409
01:10:09,147 --> 01:10:11,514
All: Eww...

1410
01:10:11,516 --> 01:10:12,681
That's right.

1411
01:10:12,683 --> 01:10:15,650
A sweet, innocent kid
you jerks beat

1412
01:10:15,652 --> 01:10:17,518
all those years back.

1413
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:19,386
You hit me with a chair.

1414
01:10:19,388 --> 01:10:21,521
And since that day

1415
01:10:21,523 --> 01:10:23,389
I've been plotting my revenge

1416
01:10:23,391 --> 01:10:25,891
waiting for the day
I'd destroy the place

1417
01:10:25,893 --> 01:10:28,526
that brought me misery.

1418
01:10:28,528 --> 01:10:31,729
Well, that day... is tonight!

1419
01:10:33,232 --> 01:10:35,298
No, no, no... No, no...

1420
01:10:40,837 --> 01:10:42,236
Left, left.

1421
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:43,705
We're pulling a boat.

1422
01:10:43,707 --> 01:10:44,806
Left, left!

1423
01:10:45,775 --> 01:10:48,275
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1424
01:10:55,015 --> 01:10:56,814
It's going right.
It's going right.

1425
01:10:56,816 --> 01:10:57,915
Turn right. Turn right.

1426
01:10:59,318 --> 01:11:00,817
Go right. Go right!

1427
01:11:02,587 --> 01:11:04,286
Whoa, oh, oh, oh...!

1428
01:11:04,288 --> 01:11:05,854
Oh, no, no!

1429
01:11:05,856 --> 01:11:06,588
No!

1430
01:11:08,491 --> 01:11:09,557
Aah...!

1431
01:11:13,562 --> 01:11:14,994
We're right on top of it.

1432
01:11:14,996 --> 01:11:15,794
Aah!

1433
01:11:15,796 --> 01:11:17,462
A big turn!

1434
01:11:18,932 --> 01:11:20,264
The bus!

1435
01:11:20,266 --> 01:11:20,998
Whoa!

1436
01:11:49,324 --> 01:11:51,457
That was pretty nifty. Yeah.

1437
01:11:51,459 --> 01:11:53,459
Thanks.

1438
01:11:53,461 --> 01:11:56,595
What do you say we go show
thimple who's boss, huh?

1439
01:11:57,998 --> 01:12:04,001
Bearrr... powerrr...!

1440
01:12:04,003 --> 01:12:05,602
Rrr... sorry.

1441
01:12:05,604 --> 01:12:06,603
Yeah.

1442
01:12:06,605 --> 01:12:07,870
Let's go!

1443
01:12:17,046 --> 01:12:18,045
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

1444
01:12:18,047 --> 01:12:20,414
¶ We're an American band ¶

1445
01:12:21,750 --> 01:12:25,852
¶ we're an American band ¶

01:12:25,854 --> 01:12:27,453

01:12:29,457 --> 01:12:31,723
¶ we're an American band ¶

1449
01:12:31,725 --> 01:12:34,459
¶ hey! We're an American band. ¶

1450
01:12:37,697 --> 01:12:44,734
¶ I hope the day will be
a lighter highway ¶

1451
01:12:44,736 --> 01:12:50,339
¶ for friends are found
on every road ¶

1452
01:12:50,341 --> 01:12:57,011
¶ can you ever think
of any better way ¶

1453
01:12:57,013 --> 01:13:03,951
¶ for the lost and weary
travelers to go? ¶

1454
01:13:03,953 --> 01:13:11,124
¶ making friends
for the world to see ¶

1455
01:13:11,126 --> 01:13:17,062
¶ let the people know
you got what you need ¶

1456
01:13:17,064 --> 01:13:23,968
¶ with a friend at hand,
you will see the light... ¶

1457
01:13:23,970 --> 01:13:25,002
dad: Here we are.

1458
01:13:25,004 --> 01:13:26,069
Beary: Hurry up. Hurry up.

1459
01:13:26,071 --> 01:13:27,570
Open the door. Open the door.

1460
01:13:27,572 --> 01:13:28,771
Watch your step.

1461
01:13:28,773 --> 01:13:29,872
Come on, guys.

1462
01:13:29,874 --> 01:13:31,506
I can't wait to see

1463
01:13:31,508 --> 01:13:32,573
the ol' place.

1464
01:13:33,642 --> 01:13:35,108
Hey, where is everybody?

1465
01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:36,375
Huh?

1466
01:13:36,377 --> 01:13:38,643
Fred: What going on?

1467
01:13:38,645 --> 01:13:41,846
No cars outside, no lights.

1468
01:13:41,848 --> 01:13:43,113
No... No people.

1469
01:13:43,115 --> 01:13:44,614
Here's the money.

1470
01:13:44,616 --> 01:13:45,781
You give me the five back

1471
01:13:45,783 --> 01:13:47,449
then I give you the ten.
Wait a minute.

1472
01:13:49,019 --> 01:13:50,685
You give me the 20...

1473
01:13:50,687 --> 01:13:51,919
Okay. Hey!

1474
01:13:51,921 --> 01:13:53,086
What's going on here?

1475
01:13:54,055 --> 01:13:55,454
I'm impressed.

1476
01:13:55,456 --> 01:13:57,456
Wow, I'm telling you.

1477
01:13:57,458 --> 01:13:59,391
I am so impressed.

1478
01:13:59,393 --> 01:14:00,959
I cannot tell you

1479
01:14:00,961 --> 01:14:05,563
how impressed I am, but,
boys, it doesn't matter.

1480
01:14:05,565 --> 01:14:07,131
The place is dead.

1481
01:14:07,133 --> 01:14:08,465
Rip... Huh?

1482
01:14:08,467 --> 01:14:09,566
Look at him.

1483
01:14:09,568 --> 01:14:11,935
He never promoted the show.

1484
01:14:11,937 --> 01:14:13,736
Wh...? Rip!

1485
01:14:13,738 --> 01:14:15,471
Oh, Reed... What,
uh, it's not me.

1486
01:14:15,473 --> 01:14:17,005
Rip.

1487
01:14:17,007 --> 01:14:18,773
Uh, hey.

1488
01:14:18,775 --> 01:14:21,075
Wow. Hey, guys, long time.

1489
01:14:21,077 --> 01:14:22,443
Looking good!

1490
01:14:22,445 --> 01:14:24,745
Henry, are you working out?

1491
01:14:24,747 --> 01:14:25,879
Rip!

1492
01:14:25,881 --> 01:14:28,448
It's not personal, Henry.

1493
01:14:28,450 --> 01:14:30,149
It's just business.

1494
01:14:30,151 --> 01:14:33,585
Business? Business
that'll ruin our lives!

1495
01:14:33,587 --> 01:14:34,719
I can't believe...!

1496
01:14:34,721 --> 01:14:36,854
Yeah, maybe, but it-it's him.

1497
01:14:36,856 --> 01:14:38,589
Big Al: Hey, ain't you guys

1498
01:14:38,591 --> 01:14:39,723
doing the show tonight?

1499
01:14:39,725 --> 01:14:41,591
Fred: Uh... Ain't gonna be one

1500
01:14:41,593 --> 01:14:42,625
big Al.

1501
01:14:42,627 --> 01:14:45,127
Nobody showed up.

1502
01:14:45,129 --> 01:14:48,196
What are you talking about,
Fred?

1503
01:14:54,069 --> 01:14:55,068
They's all out

1504
01:14:55,070 --> 01:14:57,003
in the back field.

1505
01:14:57,005 --> 01:14:58,504
They're what?

1506
01:14:58,506 --> 01:15:02,007
Didn't want anyone parkin'
on my grass out front.

1507
01:15:03,610 --> 01:15:05,610
Man: Whoo-hoo!

1508
01:15:09,215 --> 01:15:10,547
No!

1509
01:15:19,723 --> 01:15:20,955
Whoo-hoo! Come on. Come on.

1510
01:15:25,127 --> 01:15:27,994
This is not over, bears!

1511
01:15:30,798 --> 01:15:33,131
I hate you bears. Aah!

1512
01:15:33,133 --> 01:15:34,599
There he is! There he is!

1513
01:15:34,601 --> 01:15:36,233
Ah, look, here's
the money I got.

1514
01:15:36,235 --> 01:15:37,767
Holy moly.

1515
01:15:41,672 --> 01:15:44,906
Henry: Well, folks,
here's the good news.

1516
01:15:44,908 --> 01:15:49,777
The count is in and we saved
country bear hall!

1517
01:15:53,916 --> 01:15:55,048
Here we go!

1518
01:15:58,987 --> 01:16:01,988
Bears, bears, bears...!

1519
01:16:05,126 --> 01:16:08,193
Good luck, you guys.

1520
01:16:08,195 --> 01:16:09,160
Hey, where you going?

1521
01:16:09,162 --> 01:16:13,197
To... sit in the audience.

1522
01:16:13,199 --> 01:16:15,866
Well, that's a weird place
for a country bear to sit

1523
01:16:15,868 --> 01:16:17,267
during a country bear concert.

1524
01:16:17,269 --> 01:16:18,868
Yeah, beary.

1525
01:16:18,870 --> 01:16:20,603
You're one of us now.

1526
01:16:21,606 --> 01:16:23,005
Welcome aboard, kid.

1527
01:16:23,007 --> 01:16:25,107
Henry: Ladies and gentlemen

1528
01:16:25,109 --> 01:16:29,010
it gives me great pleasure
to introduce to you...

1529
01:16:29,012 --> 01:16:31,746
after an absence of many years...

1530
01:16:31,748 --> 01:16:34,882
the one, the only

1531
01:16:34,884 --> 01:16:38,118
the country bears!

1532
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:40,086
Ha, ha! Whoo!

1533
01:17:00,271 --> 01:17:04,873
¶ We take the long way around ¶

1534
01:17:04,875 --> 01:17:10,144
¶ we get lost and we get found ¶

1535
01:17:10,146 --> 01:17:15,748
¶ I wonder why we couldn't go ¶

1536
01:17:15,750 --> 01:17:18,283
¶ straight to the heart
of love ¶

1537
01:17:20,987 --> 01:17:25,922
¶ Climbing mountains,
crossing streams ¶

1538
01:17:25,924 --> 01:17:30,126
¶ crying tears
and dreaming dreams ¶

1539
01:17:30,128 --> 01:17:35,564
¶ I guess that's the only way
we know ¶

1540
01:17:35,566 --> 01:17:38,333
¶ straight to the heart
of love ¶

1541
01:17:38,335 --> 01:17:40,268
sing it!

1542
01:17:40,270 --> 01:17:45,272
¶ Straight to the heart
of love should be ¶

1543
01:17:45,274 --> 01:17:50,243
¶ the shortest distance
from lonely ¶

1544
01:17:50,245 --> 01:17:55,580
¶ not always the road
you're thinking of ¶

1545
01:17:55,582 --> 01:17:58,082
¶ straight to the heart
of love ¶

1546
01:18:00,586 --> 01:18:04,854
¶ So, take a chance,
shine your light ¶

1547
01:18:04,856 --> 01:18:06,021
isn't it wonderful?

1548
01:18:06,023 --> 01:18:10,658
¶ Everything will be all right ¶

1549
01:18:10,660 --> 01:18:15,929
¶ you're gonna find a way
to go ¶

1550
01:18:15,931 --> 01:18:18,698
¶ straight to the heart
of love ¶

1551
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:21,133
woman: I love you!

1552
01:18:21,135 --> 01:18:25,637
¶ Straight to the heart
of love should be ¶

1553
01:18:25,639 --> 01:18:30,841
¶ the shortest distance
from lonely ¶

1554
01:18:30,843 --> 01:18:35,711
¶ not always the road
you're thinking of ¶

1555
01:18:35,713 --> 01:18:39,081
¶ straight to the heart
of love ¶

1556
01:18:40,951 --> 01:18:45,787
¶ I've been thinking
about you and me ¶

1557
01:18:45,789 --> 01:18:50,658
¶ and how this love was meant
to be ¶

1558
01:18:50,660 --> 01:18:55,829
¶ I'm taking
the next clear shot I see ¶

1559
01:18:55,831 --> 01:19:01,168
¶ straight to the heart
of love ¶

1560
01:19:01,170 --> 01:19:06,839
¶ I'm taking
the next clear shot I see ¶

1561
01:19:06,841 --> 01:19:11,043
¶ straight to the heart
of love... ¶

1562
01:19:22,254 --> 01:19:27,056
¶ Straight to the heart
of love ¶

1563
01:19:27,058 --> 01:19:29,258
¶ straight ¶

1564
01:19:31,395 --> 01:19:35,363
¶ straight to the heart
of love ¶

1565
01:19:35,365 --> 01:19:38,031
¶ straight ¶

1566
01:19:40,035 --> 01:19:42,869
¶ straight ¶

1567
01:19:44,105 --> 01:19:45,270
¶ Straight ¶

1568
01:19:47,773 --> 01:19:48,872
Oh, yeah.

1569
01:19:48,874 --> 01:19:50,807
¶ Straight ¶

1570
01:19:50,809 --> 01:19:52,375
go, man, go.

1571
01:19:52,377 --> 01:19:54,143
¶ Straight ¶

1572
01:20:04,253 --> 01:20:05,852
Who's that little bear?

1573
01:20:05,854 --> 01:20:07,486
Oh, that's no little bear.

1574
01:20:07,488 --> 01:20:08,854
That's my brother!

1575
01:20:08,856 --> 01:20:10,088
Yay! Whoo-hoo!

1576
01:20:31,510 --> 01:20:36,212
¶ Straight to the heart
of love ¶

1577
01:20:36,214 --> 01:20:38,080
¶ straight ¶

1578
01:20:40,384 --> 01:20:44,119
¶ straight to the heart
of love ¶

1579
01:20:44,121 --> 01:20:46,921
¶ straight. ¶

1580
01:21:00,401 --> 01:21:04,102
The country bears!

1581
01:21:05,472 --> 01:21:08,206
How about that, folks?

1582
01:21:11,511 --> 01:21:12,977
Yo, beary!

1583
01:21:12,979 --> 01:21:14,979
Whoo-whoo-whoo!

1584
01:21:14,981 --> 01:21:17,014
You're the bear!
You're the bear!

1585
01:21:17,016 --> 01:21:18,949
Yay!

1586
01:21:18,951 --> 01:21:21,518
Yay!

1587
01:21:28,492 --> 01:21:32,093
¶ There's a town down the road ¶

1588
01:21:32,095 --> 01:21:36,464
¶ where I ain't been before ¶

1589
01:21:36,466 --> 01:21:40,100
¶ nobody knows my name ¶

1590
01:21:40,102 --> 01:21:45,571
¶ or what I'm looking for ¶

1591
01:21:45,573 --> 01:21:49,341
¶ maybe things will be
a little different ¶

1592
01:21:49,343 --> 01:21:53,645
¶ 'cause it can't
stay the same ¶

1593
01:21:53,647 --> 01:21:57,248
¶ I'm gonna ease on
down the road ¶

1594
01:21:57,250 --> 01:22:02,019
¶ where nobody knows my name. ¶

1595
01:22:22,306 --> 01:22:26,241
Don was: <i>14 platinum
records, 26 top ten singles.</i>

1596
01:22:26,243 --> 01:22:29,510
The bears to me really typify
rock and roll.

1597
01:22:31,213 --> 01:22:34,013
Their lives embody freedom.

1598
01:22:34,015 --> 01:22:35,447
<i>Nobody tells them what to do.</i>

1599
01:22:39,284 --> 01:22:40,983
Hello.

1600
01:22:40,985 --> 01:22:42,551
Everybody loves the bears.

1601
01:22:42,553 --> 01:22:45,253
The reason I do what I do today
is because of the bears.

1602
01:22:45,255 --> 01:22:47,321
I needed a... you know...

1603
01:22:47,323 --> 01:22:49,556
Somebody that I could relate to,
a certain band

1604
01:22:49,558 --> 01:22:51,958
and the bears... they just did it
for me, you know?

1605
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:54,226
I admired their, uh, courage.

1606
01:22:56,096 --> 01:22:57,462
And their tenacity.

1607
01:22:58,932 --> 01:23:00,097
And their ability to go out

1608
01:23:00,099 --> 01:23:02,165
and fight
for what they believed in.

1609
01:23:04,369 --> 01:23:06,235
Real legends. It's incredible.

1610
01:23:08,072 --> 01:23:10,472
And I'm glad we didn't get them,
you know, during wintertime.

1611
01:23:13,977 --> 01:23:15,242
Hmm?

1612
01:23:15,244 --> 01:23:17,143
The country was cool and all,
but, you know

1613
01:23:17,145 --> 01:23:19,245
it was becoming the hip-hop
generation, you know.

1614
01:23:19,247 --> 01:23:20,713
People wanted the beat.

1615
01:23:20,714 --> 01:23:22,180
<i>The streets was pop.</i>
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

1616
01:23:22,183 --> 01:23:23,615
<i>Let 'em feel</i>
<i>what the country feel like</i>

1617
01:23:23,617 --> 01:23:24,616
<i>when it's bangin'.</i>

1618
01:23:24,618 --> 01:23:25,984
¶ Bow, unh. ¶

1619
01:23:25,986 --> 01:23:27,251
you know what I'm saying?
¶ huh. ¶

1620
01:23:27,253 --> 01:23:29,486
we could do that.

1621
01:23:29,488 --> 01:23:31,187
I found myself going back

1622
01:23:31,189 --> 01:23:32,988
and-and sampling some
of the baselines

1623
01:23:32,990 --> 01:23:35,357
<i>that the bears had</i>
<i>and-and then we used it</i>

1624
01:23:35,359 --> 01:23:37,525
in our first single
and got sued by 'em.

1625
01:23:38,661 --> 01:23:40,227
It was like nothing
I'd ever heard.

1626
01:23:42,631 --> 01:23:44,497
Wow! What is this?

1627
01:23:46,634 --> 01:23:48,634
I have respect for all peoples

1628
01:23:48,636 --> 01:23:49,968
and all bears.

1629
01:23:49,970 --> 01:23:52,370
Bears are human beings,
just like us.

1630
01:23:52,372 --> 01:23:53,504
You understand?

1631
01:23:53,506 --> 01:23:55,038
I'm an alien.

1632
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:56,172
Willie Nelson: <i>Me and zeb</i>

1633
01:23:56,174 --> 01:23:57,306
opened up a can of honey

1634
01:23:57,308 --> 01:23:58,674
on the roof of the white house.

1635
01:23:58,676 --> 01:23:59,675
We had a great time.

1636
01:23:59,677 --> 01:24:01,510
I'm a honey. They dip honey.

1637
01:24:01,512 --> 01:24:02,511
I'm a honey dip.

1638
01:24:02,513 --> 01:24:04,045
You know what I'm saying?

1639
01:24:04,047 --> 01:24:05,379
It's a honey thing, b.

1640
01:24:05,381 --> 01:24:07,114
A certain amount
of honey, they...

1641
01:24:07,116 --> 01:24:08,648
They start to lose focus.

1642
01:24:12,286 --> 01:24:13,652
It was bad.

1643
01:24:13,654 --> 01:24:15,186
Bon appetit.

1644
01:24:16,422 --> 01:24:19,556
They'll eat anything
that isn't locked up.

1645
01:24:19,558 --> 01:24:20,690
Hey, you want a sandwich?

1646
01:24:20,692 --> 01:24:22,692
Uh, no thanks.

1647
01:24:22,694 --> 01:24:24,593
I had trout for breakfast.

1648
01:24:24,595 --> 01:24:27,295
The bears made me feel proud
to be a full-figured woman.

1649
01:24:27,297 --> 01:24:29,397
You want me to eat you,
don't you?

1650
01:24:29,399 --> 01:24:31,232
These guys were fat

1651
01:24:31,234 --> 01:24:33,267
long before it was spelled
with a "ph."

1652
01:24:33,269 --> 01:24:35,535
Come on. In you go.

1653
01:24:35,537 --> 01:24:36,669
I always hated bears.

1654
01:24:36,671 --> 01:24:38,070
I knew it.

1655
01:25:00,093 --> 01:25:03,160

1661
01:27:48,888 --> 01:27:49,920
cheets: You have one.

1662
01:27:49,922 --> 01:27:51,454
The guys at the
station have one.

1663
01:27:51,456 --> 01:27:52,588
Oh.

1664
01:27:52,590 --> 01:27:54,323
Even Mrs. Davis,
our receptionist, has one.

1665
01:27:54,325 --> 01:27:55,857
You don't have to
wear no fake mustache

1666
01:27:55,859 --> 01:27:57,191
to impress me.

1667
01:27:57,193 --> 01:27:58,325
Thank you.

1668
01:27:58,327 --> 01:27:59,926
You know, I'm kind of glad
this happened.

1669
01:27:59,928 --> 01:28:01,394
Well, good.

1670
01:28:01,396 --> 01:28:03,262
Now, you don't have to
wear no mustache, right?

1671
01:28:03,264 --> 01:28:05,364
No, I'm wearing the mustache.
