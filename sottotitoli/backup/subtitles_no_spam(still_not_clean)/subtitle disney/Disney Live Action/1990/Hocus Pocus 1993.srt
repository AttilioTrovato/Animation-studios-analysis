1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:15,000

2
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,476
Emily?

3
00:01:39,606 --> 00:01:40,555
Emily!

4
00:01:40,691 --> 00:01:43,894
Come, little children

5
00:01:44,028 --> 00:01:48,157
I'll take thee away

6
00:01:48,283 --> 00:01:51,284
- Into a land
- Emily!

7
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:56,038
Of enchantment

8
00:01:56,167 --> 00:01:59,417
Come, little children

9
00:01:59,546 --> 00:02:03,674
- The time's come to say
- Elijah! Elijah!

10
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,718
- Hast thou seen my sister Emily?
- Nay.

11
00:02:06,845 --> 00:02:09,633
But look. They conjure.

12
00:02:09,765 --> 00:02:11,675
Oh, God. The woods!

13
00:02:20,778 --> 00:02:22,403
Emily!

14
00:02:24,157 --> 00:02:26,197
- She's done for.
- Not yet!

15
00:02:26,326 --> 00:02:29,530
You wake my father.
Summon the elders. Go!

16
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,953
Emily!

17
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,914
Come, child.

18
00:03:41,077 --> 00:03:43,284
- Ahh.
- Oh, yes.

19
00:03:43,413 --> 00:03:44,824
- Emily.
- Huh?

20
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:03,849
Oh, look.
Another glorious morning.

21
00:04:03,978 --> 00:04:07,644
It makes me sick!

22
00:04:07,774 --> 00:04:10,100
- Sisters!
- Yes, Winnie.
- We're coming, Winnie.

23
00:04:10,235 --> 00:04:12,524
Right away. Sorry.

24
00:04:12,655 --> 00:04:14,944
Must've been an imp.

25
00:04:15,074 --> 00:04:19,653
My darling.
My little book.

26
00:04:19,788 --> 00:04:23,656
We must continue with our spell now that
our little guest of honour has arrived.

27
00:04:23,792 --> 00:04:27,162
Wake up. Wake up, darling.

28
00:04:27,296 --> 00:04:32,636
Yes. Oh, come along, darling.
There you are.

29
00:04:32,761 --> 00:04:35,217
- Mary!
- Right here, Winnie, right here.

30
00:04:35,347 --> 00:04:38,017
- Sorry.
- Hello. Hello.

31
00:04:38,142 --> 00:04:42,223
- I've noticed sister Sarah
isn't helping.
- I lured the child here.

32
00:04:42,355 --> 00:04:45,771
Leave her be.
She hath done her chore.

33
00:04:45,901 --> 00:04:47,692
- You're right, I'm wrong.
- Mmm.

34
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,276
All right.

35
00:04:50,406 --> 00:04:52,198
'Tis time!

36
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:59,785
There it is: "Bring to a full rolling
bubble. Add two drops oil of boil."

37
00:04:59,917 --> 00:05:02,289
Ah-ah-ah. I got it. It's heavy.
You do that, I'll do this.

38
00:05:10,345 --> 00:05:13,430
"Mix blood of owl
with the herb that's red.

39
00:05:13,557 --> 00:05:16,724
Turn three times,
pluck a hair from my head.

40
00:05:16,853 --> 00:05:20,388
Add a dash of pox
and a dead man's toe."

41
00:05:20,523 --> 00:05:24,569
- Dead man's toe,
and make it a fleshy one.
- Dead man's toe!

42
00:05:24,695 --> 00:05:27,566
Dead man's toe
Add a dead man's toe

43
00:05:27,698 --> 00:05:30,071
Dead man's toe Dead man's t...

44
00:05:30,201 --> 00:05:32,573
Dead, dead, dead, dead
Dead, dead, dead, dead

45
00:05:32,704 --> 00:05:34,079
D... Ooh!

46
00:05:35,499 --> 00:05:39,082
- Uh-oh. Dead man's toe
- Fresh one.

47
00:05:40,922 --> 00:05:42,998
- Dead man, dead man
- Dead man's toe, add a...

48
00:05:45,969 --> 00:05:50,513
Will you two stop that!
I need to concentrate!

49
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:52,848
Sorry, uh...

50
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:55,433
She needs to concentrate.

51
00:06:04,073 --> 00:06:07,276
"Green newt saliva."

52
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:11,954
- I-I smell a child.
- Ehh, what dost thou call that?

53
00:06:12,082 --> 00:06:14,122
- A child.
- Hmph!

54
00:06:14,251 --> 00:06:17,336
Sisters, gather 'round.

55
00:06:17,463 --> 00:06:20,298
- One thing more, and all is done.
- Yes?

56
00:06:20,425 --> 00:06:23,379
Add a bit of thine own tongue.

57
00:06:26,098 --> 00:06:30,345
Oh, Winnie, thou art divine.

58
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:33,230
'Tis ready for tasting.

59
00:06:33,356 --> 00:06:38,019
One drop of this
and her life will be mine.

60
00:06:38,153 --> 00:06:40,561
- I mean, ours.
- Yeah.

61
00:06:44,285 --> 00:06:46,907
All right, girl.

62
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:49,411
Open up your mouth.

63
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:52,661
- No!
- A boy!

64
00:06:52,795 --> 00:06:56,579
- Get him, you fools!
- I got him. I knew I smelled a boy!

65
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:59,172
I got him. Come on. Come on.

66
00:06:59,302 --> 00:07:00,678
- Get away!
- Here you go.

67
00:07:00,804 --> 00:07:02,678
- Get away from my potion!
- Ohh!

68
00:07:07,061 --> 00:07:08,436
Ohh!

69
00:07:09,897 --> 00:07:12,353
- Winnie!
- My potion!

70
00:07:13,026 --> 00:07:14,401
Emily!

71
00:07:18,991 --> 00:07:20,865
Hmm. Hmm.

72
00:07:29,336 --> 00:07:32,919
Winnie. Winnie.

73
00:07:33,049 --> 00:07:36,050
- Look.
- Ahh!

74
00:07:36,177 --> 00:07:38,929
Sisters, prepare thyselves.

75
00:07:39,055 --> 00:07:42,472
'Tis her life force.
The potion works!

76
00:07:42,601 --> 00:07:46,267
Take my hands.
We will share her.

77
00:07:46,397 --> 00:07:49,067
Oh, Winnie,
how generous of thee.

78
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:11,173
Sisters, behold!

79
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:16,675
I am beautiful!
Boys will love me!

80
00:08:18,183 --> 00:08:20,176
We're young!

81
00:08:21,604 --> 00:08:24,177
Well, younger.

82
00:08:24,315 --> 00:08:26,189
But it's a start!

83
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,484
Sisters!

84
00:08:30,989 --> 00:08:33,315
Winifred, thou art
a mere sprig of a girl.

85
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:35,906
Liar! But I shall be
a sprig forever,

86
00:08:36,037 --> 00:08:40,533
once I suck the life out of
all the children in Salem!

87
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:43,289
Let's brew another batch!

88
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:47,549
You hag! There are not enough
children in the world to make
thee young and beautiful!

89
00:08:47,675 --> 00:08:50,462
- Hag.
- Uh-oh.

90
00:08:50,595 --> 00:08:54,676
Sisters, did you hear
what he called you?

91
00:08:54,808 --> 00:08:56,635
Whatever shall we do with him?

92
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:59,521
Let's barbecue and fillet him.

93
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:03,431
- Hang him on a hook
and let me play with him?
- No!

94
00:09:03,568 --> 00:09:07,352
Book, darling, come to Mommy.

95
00:09:07,489 --> 00:09:11,238
Yes. His punishment
must be more fulsome,

96
00:09:11,368 --> 00:09:13,408
more lingering.

97
00:09:13,538 --> 00:09:17,073
Dazzle me, my darling.

98
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:20,163
Let's see: Amnesia, bunions,
chilblains, cholera.

99
00:09:20,295 --> 00:09:22,917
- We can do better than that, I think.
- Yes.

100
00:09:23,048 --> 00:09:24,958
Let's see what we have. Oh!

101
00:09:25,092 --> 00:09:28,628
Ahh. Perfect.

102
00:09:28,763 --> 00:09:31,171
As usual.

103
00:09:31,308 --> 00:09:35,555
- His punishment shall not be to die,
- No?

104
00:09:35,688 --> 00:09:39,638
But to live forever
with his guilt.

105
00:09:39,776 --> 00:09:43,477
- As what, Winnie, as what?
- As what, Winnie, as what?
- Jump back!

106
00:09:43,613 --> 00:09:46,021
Twist the bones
and bend the back.

107
00:09:46,158 --> 00:09:48,198
Itch-it-a-cop-it-a,
Mel-a-ka-mys-tic-a.

108
00:09:48,327 --> 00:09:50,450
Trim him of his baby fat.

109
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,703
Itch-it-a-cop-it-a,
Mel-a-ka-mys-tic-a.

110
00:09:52,832 --> 00:09:55,039
Give him fur, black as black.

111
00:09:55,168 --> 00:09:57,624
- Just...
- Like...
- This.

112
00:10:16,359 --> 00:10:18,019
- Open!
- Witches!

113
00:10:18,152 --> 00:10:20,145
Daughters of darkness!
Open this door!

114
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,771
- Hide the child!
- The child!
- Come on!

115
00:10:22,908 --> 00:10:26,953
Witches? Uh, there be
no witches here, sir!

116
00:10:27,079 --> 00:10:29,950
Don't get your knickers
in a twist!

117
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:33,084
We are just three kindly
old spinster ladies!

118
00:10:33,211 --> 00:10:36,082
Uh, spending a quiet
evening at home!

119
00:10:36,215 --> 00:10:38,587
Sucking the lives
out of little children!

120
00:10:39,885 --> 00:10:42,424
- Winifred Sanderson?
- Yes?

121
00:10:42,555 --> 00:10:44,928
I will ask thee one final time.

122
00:10:45,058 --> 00:10:47,929
- Yes?
- What hast thou done
with my son Thackery?

123
00:10:48,061 --> 00:10:50,268
- Thackery. Mmm.
- Answer me!

124
00:10:50,397 --> 00:10:53,067
- Well, I don't know.
- Speak!

125
00:10:53,192 --> 00:10:55,150
Cat's got my tongue.

126
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:05,029
This is... This is
terribly uncomfortable.

127
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,204
Sisters, sing.

128
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:14,338
Thrice I with mercury purify
and spit upon the 12 tables

129
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:17,800
- Don't listen! Cover your ears!
- Listen to them not!

130
00:11:21,599 --> 00:11:24,803
Ah! Fools! All of you!

131
00:11:24,936 --> 00:11:27,013
My ungodly book speaks to you.

132
00:11:27,147 --> 00:11:29,473
On All Hallows Eve
when the moon is round,

133
00:11:29,608 --> 00:11:33,559
a virgin will summon us
from under the ground.

134
00:11:33,696 --> 00:11:36,484
Ohh! Ohhh! We shall be back!

135
00:11:36,616 --> 00:11:39,902
And the lives of all
the children shall be mine!

136
00:12:02,813 --> 00:12:04,770
Away!

137
00:12:04,898 --> 00:12:07,022
Away, beast!

138
00:12:10,655 --> 00:12:12,482
Poor Thackery Binx.

139
00:12:12,616 --> 00:12:16,234
Neither his father, his mother,
nor anyone else...

140
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:18,695
ever knew what became of him...

141
00:12:18,831 --> 00:12:22,283
those 300 years ago.

142
00:12:22,418 --> 00:12:26,499
And so the Sanderson Sisters...

143
00:12:26,631 --> 00:12:30,582
were hanged
by the Salem town folk.

144
00:12:30,719 --> 00:12:34,219
Now, there are those who say
that on Halloween night...

145
00:12:34,349 --> 00:12:39,936
a black cat still guards
the old Sanderson house,

146
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:44,393
warning off any who
might make the witches...

147
00:12:44,527 --> 00:12:47,065
come back to life!

148
00:12:50,826 --> 00:12:53,447
Gimme a break.

149
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:57,363
Aha. We seem to have
a sceptic in our midst.

150
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,576
Mr Dennison,
would you care to share...

151
00:12:59,711 --> 00:13:03,127
your California, laid-back,
tie-dyed point of view?

152
00:13:05,008 --> 00:13:06,668
Okay.

153
00:13:06,802 --> 00:13:08,795
Granted that, uh,
you guys here in Salem...

154
00:13:08,929 --> 00:13:12,014
are all into these, uh, black
cats and witches and stuff.

155
00:13:12,141 --> 00:13:14,430
- Stuff?
- Fine.

156
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:18,096
But everyone here knows that Halloween
was invented by the candy companies.

157
00:13:18,232 --> 00:13:20,723
- Ohh!
- It's a conspiracy.

158
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,398
It just so happens that
Halloween is based...

159
00:13:23,529 --> 00:13:26,400
on the ancient feast
called All Hallows Eve.

160
00:13:26,533 --> 00:13:30,151
It's the one night of the year
where the spirits of the dead
can return to Earth.

161
00:13:33,415 --> 00:13:35,954
Well said, Allison.

162
00:13:39,339 --> 00:13:44,001
Well, in case Jimi Hendrix shows
up tonight, here's my number.

163
00:13:49,934 --> 00:13:51,892
Come on, let's go.

164
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,301
- Hey, wait up.
- Did he call you?

165
00:13:53,438 --> 00:13:55,312
- Yeah.
- Well, what did he say?

166
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,979
Max. Fat chance.

167
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,262
- Allison.
- Hi.

168
00:14:23,389 --> 00:14:28,051
Hi. Look, um, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to embarrass you in class.

169
00:14:28,186 --> 00:14:30,393
You didn't.

170
00:14:30,522 --> 00:14:33,393
- My name is Max Dennison.
- Yeah, I know.
You just moved here, huh?

171
00:14:33,525 --> 00:14:36,527
- Yeah, last week.
- Must be a big change for you.

172
00:14:36,654 --> 00:14:38,694
Yeah, that's for sure.

173
00:14:38,823 --> 00:14:43,201
- You don't like it here?
- Oh, the leaves are great, but...

174
00:14:43,328 --> 00:14:47,029
- I-I don't know.
Just all this Halloween stuff.
- You don't believe in it?

175
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:50,535
What, do you mean, like,
the Sanderson Sisters? No way.

176
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:53,790
- Not even on Halloween?
- Especially not on Halloween.

177
00:14:55,509 --> 00:14:58,214
Trick or treat.

178
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,728
- Hey, Christie, wait for me.
- No, I don't think so.
- I'm coming!

179
00:15:45,941 --> 00:15:49,061
Halt! Who are you?

180
00:15:49,194 --> 00:15:51,437
Max. I just moved here.

181
00:15:51,572 --> 00:15:54,490
- From where?
- Los Angeles.

182
00:15:57,162 --> 00:15:59,949
- L. A?
- Ohh!

183
00:16:00,082 --> 00:16:03,534
- Dude!
- Tubular.

184
00:16:03,669 --> 00:16:05,876
I'm Jay. This is Ernie.

185
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:10,758
How many times I gotta tell you,
my name ain't Ernie no more.

186
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:13,638
- It's Ice.
- Oh.
- Ice.

187
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,851
This is Ice.

188
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:26,643
So, let's have a butt.

189
00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:28,570
Ah, no, thanks. I don't smoke.

190
00:16:28,698 --> 00:16:31,070
They're very health conscious
in Los Angeles.

191
00:16:35,288 --> 00:16:37,162
You got any cash...

192
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:40,702
Hollywood?

193
00:16:40,836 --> 00:16:43,506
- No.
- Gee.

194
00:16:43,631 --> 00:16:48,424
We don't get any smokes from
you, we don't get any cash.

195
00:16:48,553 --> 00:16:51,471
What am I supposed to do
with my afternoon?

196
00:16:51,598 --> 00:16:54,386
Maybe you could learn to
breathe through your nose.

197
00:16:57,981 --> 00:16:59,855
Whoa!

198
00:16:59,983 --> 00:17:02,557
Check out
the new cross-trainers.

199
00:17:02,694 --> 00:17:05,400
Cool. Let me try 'em on.

200
00:17:07,325 --> 00:17:08,736
Ah-ah.

201
00:17:11,496 --> 00:17:14,700
- Later, dude!
- See ya, Hollywood!

202
00:17:31,644 --> 00:17:34,515
- Hey, Max! Hey, how was school?
- It sucked!

203
00:17:34,647 --> 00:17:36,391
Hey, hey, hey,
watch your language.

204
00:17:39,528 --> 00:17:42,399
I can't believe
you made me move here!

205
00:17:48,538 --> 00:17:50,911
Huh. He wasn't wearing
any shoes.

206
00:17:52,251 --> 00:17:55,168
Well, must be
some form of protest.

207
00:18:09,312 --> 00:18:11,186
Hey, guys.

208
00:18:27,582 --> 00:18:30,121
Oh, Allison.

209
00:18:30,252 --> 00:18:32,957
You're so soft.
I just wanna...

210
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:35,964
- Boo!
- Dani!

211
00:18:39,763 --> 00:18:42,883
I scared you, I scared you!
Ha ha ha-ha ha!

212
00:18:43,016 --> 00:18:47,145
I'm Allison. Allison.
Kiss me. I'm Allison!

213
00:18:47,271 --> 00:18:49,513
Mom and Dad told you
to stay out of my room!

214
00:18:49,649 --> 00:18:51,808
Don't be such a crab!

215
00:18:51,943 --> 00:18:55,479
Guess what. You're gonna
take me trick-or-treating.

216
00:18:55,614 --> 00:18:58,568
- Not this year, Dani.
- Mom said you have to.

217
00:18:58,701 --> 00:19:01,987
- Well, she can take you.
- She and Dad are going to
a party at Town Hall.

218
00:19:02,121 --> 00:19:04,079
Well, you're eight!
Go by yourself!

219
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:14,499
No way! This is my first time!
I'll get lost!

220
00:19:14,636 --> 00:19:18,171
Besides, it's a full moon
outside! The weirdos are out!

221
00:19:22,186 --> 00:19:27,347
Come on, Max. Couldn't you
forget about being a cool
teenager just for one night?

222
00:19:27,484 --> 00:19:29,642
Please? Come on.

223
00:19:29,778 --> 00:19:34,025
We used to have so much fun together
trick-or-treating. Remember?

224
00:19:34,158 --> 00:19:36,447
Lt'll be like old times.

225
00:19:36,577 --> 00:19:39,365
No. The old days are dead.

226
00:19:39,497 --> 00:19:43,032
It doesn't matter what you say.
You're taking me!

227
00:19:43,168 --> 00:19:45,042
Wanna bet?

228
00:19:53,847 --> 00:19:56,516
Mom!

229
00:19:59,019 --> 00:20:02,720
Let's go. Hurry up!
The bewitching hour is about to begin!

230
00:20:02,857 --> 00:20:04,731
Wow... Aah! Please help me!
Aah!

231
00:20:04,859 --> 00:20:08,063
- Isn't that a scary witch?
- Stop! You look very scary. Wow!

232
00:20:10,741 --> 00:20:13,446
What about you, Max?
What are you supposed to be?

233
00:20:13,577 --> 00:20:15,701
- A rap singer.
- Oh.

234
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,704
Well, your hat should be
on sideways, shouldn't it?

235
00:20:17,832 --> 00:20:19,706
- Say "Halloween"!
- Halloween!
- Halloween!

236
00:20:23,964 --> 00:20:26,337
- Trick or treat!
- Trick or treat!

237
00:20:33,642 --> 00:20:36,014
- Lighten up, Max.
- Can we go home now?

238
00:20:36,145 --> 00:20:38,019
No.

239
00:20:46,615 --> 00:20:49,189
Let's just go this way.

240
00:20:49,326 --> 00:20:50,275
Dani.

241
00:20:52,246 --> 00:20:54,156
Ding-ding. Ding-ding.

242
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:57,541
- Stop and pay the toll, kid.
- Ten chocolate bars. No licorice.

243
00:20:57,669 --> 00:21:01,964
- Dump out your sack.
- Drop dead. Moron.

244
00:21:02,091 --> 00:21:04,297
- Whoa!
- Ooh!

245
00:21:04,427 --> 00:21:06,633
Yo, twerp.

246
00:21:06,763 --> 00:21:09,634
- How'd you like to be hung
off that telephone pole?
- Yeah!

247
00:21:09,766 --> 00:21:14,808
I'd just like to see you try,
because it just so happens
I've got my big brother with me.

248
00:21:14,939 --> 00:21:16,647
- Oooh!
- Max!

249
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:22,987
- Hollywood!
- Oh, no!

250
00:21:28,663 --> 00:21:32,577
So, you're doing
a little trick-or-treating.

251
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:34,583
- Ding-dong.
- Whoo!

252
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:39,412
- I'm just taking
my little sister around.
- Mmm.

253
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,424
That's nice.

254
00:21:41,552 --> 00:21:45,052
- Whoa! I love the costume!
- Yeah!

255
00:21:45,181 --> 00:21:48,681
But what are you supposed to be?
A New Kid On The Block?

256
00:21:50,229 --> 00:21:53,230
For your information,
he's a Little Leaguer.

257
00:21:53,357 --> 00:21:55,516
- Whoa!
- Ooh, tough guy!
- I'm a Little Leaguer!

258
00:21:55,652 --> 00:21:57,027
Whoa!

259
00:21:58,405 --> 00:22:00,813
Yeah!

260
00:22:00,949 --> 00:22:04,864
- Wait a minute.
Everybody pays the toll.
- Stuff it, zitface.

261
00:22:04,995 --> 00:22:06,704
- Why, you little...
- Hey!

262
00:22:06,831 --> 00:22:10,034
Ice, here. Pig out.

263
00:22:10,168 --> 00:22:12,208
Come on, Dani, let's go.

264
00:22:12,337 --> 00:22:13,879
Jerk.

265
00:22:14,006 --> 00:22:16,579
And Hollywood,
the shoes fit great!

266
00:22:19,178 --> 00:22:20,459
Yeah!

267
00:22:20,596 --> 00:22:22,589
- Trick or treat!
- You should've punched him.

268
00:22:22,724 --> 00:22:25,096
He would've killed me.

269
00:22:25,227 --> 00:22:28,263
- At least you would've died like a man.
- Hey!

270
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:34,851
You just humiliated me in front
of half the guys at school!

271
00:22:34,988 --> 00:22:37,942
So collect your candy
and get out of my life!

272
00:22:38,075 --> 00:22:40,281
I wanna go home now!

273
00:22:42,413 --> 00:22:45,948
- Trick or treat!
- Trick or treat!
- Hi. Hi. Ooh, there's plenty...

274
00:22:57,013 --> 00:22:59,338
Dani, I'm sorry.

275
00:22:59,474 --> 00:23:02,012
Trick or treat!

276
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:04,931
It's just that
I hate this place.

277
00:23:05,064 --> 00:23:07,222
I miss all my friends.

278
00:23:07,358 --> 00:23:09,315
I wanna go home!

279
00:23:09,444 --> 00:23:12,860
Well, this is your home now,
so get used to it.

280
00:23:14,616 --> 00:23:16,609
Yeah.

281
00:23:16,743 --> 00:23:20,243
Trick or treat!

282
00:23:20,373 --> 00:23:23,244
- Give me one more chance?
- Why should I?

283
00:23:25,378 --> 00:23:27,252
Because I'm your brother.

284
00:23:34,764 --> 00:23:37,635
Whoa. Check that out.

285
00:23:38,768 --> 00:23:40,642
What?

286
00:23:40,771 --> 00:23:42,977
Something just flew
across the moon.

287
00:23:49,572 --> 00:23:52,490
- Fooled ya.
- Let's go, jerkface.

288
00:23:52,617 --> 00:23:54,160
- Trick or treat!
- Trick or treat!

289
00:23:54,286 --> 00:23:56,160
- Wow!
- Wow!

290
00:23:56,288 --> 00:23:58,246
Check out this house!

291
00:23:58,374 --> 00:24:00,782
Ehh. Rich people.

292
00:24:00,919 --> 00:24:03,754
They'd probably make us
drink cider and bob for apples.

293
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,668
- My accountant suggested penny stocks.
- Yeah.

294
00:24:10,638 --> 00:24:12,595
- Trick or treat!
- Trick or treat!

295
00:24:15,101 --> 00:24:17,771
- Jackpot!
- Ahh.

296
00:24:17,896 --> 00:24:19,355
Whoa!

297
00:24:21,066 --> 00:24:23,688
Max Dennison.

298
00:24:23,819 --> 00:24:25,018
Allison!

299
00:24:25,154 --> 00:24:28,606
Ohh. Allison, hmm?

300
00:24:28,742 --> 00:24:31,447
I thought you weren't
into Halloween.

301
00:24:31,578 --> 00:24:34,864
I'm not. I'm, I'm just taking
my little sister Dani around.

302
00:24:34,999 --> 00:24:36,742
That's nice.

303
00:24:36,876 --> 00:24:40,210
- I always do it.
- My parents made him.

304
00:24:40,338 --> 00:24:42,545
Do you guys want some cider?

305
00:24:42,674 --> 00:24:44,382
- No.
- Sure.

306
00:24:48,848 --> 00:24:51,386
- Ah, yes.
- Oh, I had my eye on that.

307
00:24:54,896 --> 00:24:56,770
Thanks.

308
00:25:00,861 --> 00:25:03,187
So, um, how's the party?

309
00:25:03,323 --> 00:25:06,443
Boring. It's just a bunch of my parents'
friends. They do this every year.

310
00:25:09,329 --> 00:25:12,081
I've got candy duty.

311
00:25:12,208 --> 00:25:15,494
- By the way, Dani, I love your costume.
- Thank you.

312
00:25:15,628 --> 00:25:17,455
I really like yours too.

313
00:25:17,589 --> 00:25:21,254
Of course, I couldn't wear anything
like that because I don't have any...

314
00:25:21,385 --> 00:25:23,923
What do you call 'em, Max?
Yabos?

315
00:25:26,182 --> 00:25:28,258
Max likes your yabos.

316
00:25:28,393 --> 00:25:30,931
In fact, he loves 'em.

317
00:25:33,982 --> 00:25:37,233
- I'm really into witches.
- Really? Me too.

318
00:25:37,361 --> 00:25:39,650
We just learned about
those sisters in school.

319
00:25:39,781 --> 00:25:41,773
Oh, you mean
the Sanderson Sisters?

320
00:25:41,908 --> 00:25:44,234
I know all about them.
My mom used to run the museum.

321
00:25:44,369 --> 00:25:46,409
There's a museum about 'em?

322
00:25:46,538 --> 00:25:51,415
Yeah, but they shut it down because, um,
a lot of spooky things happened there.

323
00:25:51,544 --> 00:25:54,462
Well, wh-why don't we go to
this old Sanderson house?

324
00:25:57,092 --> 00:25:59,464
Well, come on,
make a believer out of me.

325
00:26:01,096 --> 00:26:03,967
Okay, let me get changed.
They'll never miss me.

326
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,897
Max, I'm not going up there.

327
00:26:12,025 --> 00:26:15,810
My friends at school told me all
about that place. It's weird!

328
00:26:15,947 --> 00:26:18,319
Dani, this is the girl
of my dreams.

329
00:26:18,449 --> 00:26:21,819
- So? Take her to the movies
like a normal person.
- Dani!

330
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:26,661
Look, just... just do
this one thing for me,

331
00:26:26,792 --> 00:26:28,666
and I'll do anything you say.

332
00:26:28,794 --> 00:26:30,871
Please?

333
00:26:31,005 --> 00:26:33,675
- Please? Please?
- Oh... Okay. Okay.

334
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,585
Next year we go trick-or-treating
as Wendy and Peter Pan.

335
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:39,595
With tights, or it's no deal.

336
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:44,557
Okay, okay. Deal. Deal. Fine.

337
00:26:48,191 --> 00:26:52,439
Legend has it that the bones
of a hundred children were
buried within these walls.

338
00:26:52,571 --> 00:26:54,445
Oh, great.

339
00:27:09,215 --> 00:27:10,876
Ecch.

340
00:27:22,355 --> 00:27:25,725
- I can't see a thing.
- Ooh.

341
00:27:28,445 --> 00:27:31,316
Well, there's a light switch
around here somewhere.

342
00:27:45,214 --> 00:27:47,088
Found a lighter.

343
00:27:55,351 --> 00:27:57,225
Whoa!

344
00:28:03,235 --> 00:28:05,524
Here's the original cauldron.

345
00:28:05,654 --> 00:28:08,110
And upstairs
is where they slept.

346
00:28:13,413 --> 00:28:16,948
Oh, and be careful where you
step. The floors are old.

347
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:23,964
"This is the spell book
of Winifred Sanderson.

348
00:28:24,092 --> 00:28:27,378
It was given to her
by the devil himself.

349
00:28:27,512 --> 00:28:29,386
The book is bound
in human skin...

350
00:28:29,515 --> 00:28:33,928
and contains the recipes for her
most powerful and evil spells."

351
00:28:34,062 --> 00:28:35,936
I get the picture.

352
00:28:37,941 --> 00:28:40,064
What's that?

353
00:28:40,193 --> 00:28:43,064
Oh. It's the black flame candle.

354
00:28:51,748 --> 00:28:55,449
Hmm. Black flame candle.

355
00:28:55,586 --> 00:28:58,042
"Made from the fat of a hangman.

356
00:28:58,172 --> 00:29:01,339
Legend says that on a full moon it
will raise the spirits of the dead...

357
00:29:01,468 --> 00:29:03,840
when lit by a virgin
on Halloween night."

358
00:29:06,974 --> 00:29:09,430
Hmm.

359
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:13,179
So let's light the sucker
and meet the old broads.

360
00:29:13,314 --> 00:29:16,185
- Will you do the honours?
- No, thanks.

361
00:29:16,318 --> 00:29:17,183
Well...

362
00:29:23,284 --> 00:29:26,535
- Stupid cat!
- Okay, Max, you've had your fun.

363
00:29:26,663 --> 00:29:29,368
It's time to go.
Come on, Allison.

364
00:29:29,499 --> 00:29:32,038
Max, she's right. Let's go.

365
00:29:32,169 --> 00:29:35,373
Oh, come on. It's just
a bunch of hocus pocus.

366
00:29:35,506 --> 00:29:39,456
Max, I'm not kidding this time.
It's time to go!

367
00:29:39,594 --> 00:29:41,468
Max, no!

368
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:46,805
Uh-oh.

369
00:30:25,521 --> 00:30:28,191
What happened?

370
00:30:28,316 --> 00:30:31,104
A virgin... lit the candle.

371
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,467
We are home!

372
00:30:54,596 --> 00:30:56,636
Oh, sweet revenge!

373
00:30:56,765 --> 00:31:00,181
Do you see, sisters?
My curse worked perfectly!

374
00:31:00,311 --> 00:31:02,019
That's because thou art perfect.

375
00:31:08,862 --> 00:31:12,148
I knew I left this cauldron on.
Didn't I tell you? Oh, I knew it.

376
00:31:12,283 --> 00:31:16,660
My lucky rat tail!
Just where I left it!

377
00:31:18,998 --> 00:31:23,791
But who lit
the black flame candle? Hmm.

378
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:32,012
Wake up. Wake up, sleepyhead.

379
00:31:32,138 --> 00:31:35,590
Oh, I've missed you.
Did you miss me too?

380
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:39,056
Come on, now,
we've got work to do.

381
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:40,647
- Winnie.
- Yes?

382
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:43,347
I smell children.

383
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:46,690
Sic 'em!

384
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:51,195
- It's a little girl.
- Mmm!

385
00:31:51,327 --> 00:31:54,114
Seven. Maybe eight.
And a half.

386
00:31:54,247 --> 00:31:56,489
Ooh, let us play with her!

387
00:31:56,624 --> 00:31:59,828
Come, little children

388
00:31:59,962 --> 00:32:03,580
I'll take thee away

389
00:32:03,716 --> 00:32:09,007
- In...
- Come out, my dear.
We will not harm thee.

390
00:32:09,139 --> 00:32:11,381
We love children!

391
00:32:12,851 --> 00:32:15,556
I thought thou would
never come, sisters.

392
00:32:15,688 --> 00:32:17,645
Greetings, little one.

393
00:32:17,773 --> 00:32:20,644
- 'Twas I who brought you back.
- Imagine.

394
00:32:22,612 --> 00:32:25,649
Such a pretty little...

395
00:32:25,783 --> 00:32:27,443
child.

396
00:32:27,576 --> 00:32:30,946
Look at her. And she's
so well fed, isn't she?

397
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,832
Plump. Plump!

398
00:32:33,958 --> 00:32:35,287
Shis-ka-baby.

399
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:40,964
Tell me, dumpling,
what is the year?

400
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:43,298
1993.

401
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:48,137
Sisters, we have been gone
300 years.

402
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:50,758
Well, Winnie,
how time flies, huh?

403
00:32:50,978 --> 00:32:52,769
When you're dead!

404
00:33:02,616 --> 00:33:06,151
It's been great fun, but l...
I guess I'd better be going.

405
00:33:06,287 --> 00:33:08,161
Oh, stay for supper.

406
00:33:10,208 --> 00:33:12,248
I'm... I'm... I'm not hungry.

407
00:33:12,377 --> 00:33:14,619
Oh, but we are.

408
00:33:17,132 --> 00:33:19,968
- Soup!
- Hey!

409
00:33:20,094 --> 00:33:22,632
- Let go of my little sister.
- Roast him, Winnie.

410
00:33:22,764 --> 00:33:25,469
No, let me.
Let me play with him.

411
00:33:37,614 --> 00:33:39,571
You. There.

412
00:33:41,702 --> 00:33:44,074
I haven't lost my touch,
sisters. See?

413
00:33:44,205 --> 00:33:45,913
- Winnie, Winnie...
- Max!

414
00:33:47,292 --> 00:33:50,495
- Hello. Goodbye.
- Hello, hello.

415
00:33:52,506 --> 00:33:54,914
Max!

416
00:33:57,804 --> 00:33:59,761
- Mary!
- Well, hello...

417
00:34:02,309 --> 00:34:04,218
- Oh, my, my, my, my, my.
- Don't!

418
00:34:06,355 --> 00:34:08,063
Okay!

419
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:11,441
- You leave my brother alone!
- Ohh!

420
00:34:12,946 --> 00:34:14,606
- Max!
- I'll get you!

421
00:34:16,867 --> 00:34:20,865
- Get him! Get this ani...
Get this beast off me!
- Max, come on. Let's go!

422
00:34:23,833 --> 00:34:25,292
Get out! Go, go, go!

423
00:34:26,753 --> 00:34:29,079
Get it off! Ahh-ha-ha-ha-ha!

424
00:34:33,886 --> 00:34:35,345
- Hey!
- Hmm?

425
00:34:37,015 --> 00:34:39,387
You've messed with the
great and powerful Max...

426
00:34:39,517 --> 00:34:41,724
and now must suffer
the consequences.

427
00:34:41,853 --> 00:34:44,226
I summon the burning rain
of death.

428
00:34:44,356 --> 00:34:46,930
- Burning what?
- Burning rain of death.
- Burning rain of death.

429
00:34:48,695 --> 00:34:50,734
He makes fire in his hand.

430
00:34:54,368 --> 00:34:56,941
Ohh! Ohh! The burning
rain of death! Ohh! Ohh!

431
00:34:57,079 --> 00:34:59,405
Come on, you idiots!
Get under shelter!

432
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:01,913
Come on, you fools!

433
00:35:07,049 --> 00:35:09,089
Nice going, Max!

434
00:35:09,218 --> 00:35:11,424
- It's all your fault!
- You can talk.

435
00:35:11,554 --> 00:35:15,801
- Yeah, no kidding.
Now, get the spell book.
- You idiots!

436
00:35:15,934 --> 00:35:18,769
Come on, move it!

437
00:35:18,895 --> 00:35:21,601
N-N-No, it's not!
It's the burning rain of death!

438
00:35:25,236 --> 00:35:27,988
Sic 'em! Aah! My book!

439
00:35:31,076 --> 00:35:34,659
Don't! He's going for my book!
Ohhh!

440
00:35:34,788 --> 00:35:36,781
- My book!
- He's got the book!
- The book!

441
00:35:38,126 --> 00:35:39,786
Max! Max, over here!

442
00:35:39,919 --> 00:35:41,877
- Come on! Come on!
- This way!

443
00:35:44,591 --> 00:35:46,668
Ohh! Confound it!

444
00:35:48,054 --> 00:35:51,304
- Winnie!
- We are dead!
- Shut up!

445
00:35:51,432 --> 00:35:54,220
- It is but water!
- Huh?

446
00:35:54,352 --> 00:35:56,061
- Most refreshing.
- Ahh. It is.

447
00:35:56,188 --> 00:35:58,761
- You idiot!
- Ahhh!
- The boy has tricked us!

448
00:35:58,899 --> 00:36:01,355
- And he's stolen the book!
- Ahhh!
- After him!
- Ohh!

449
00:36:10,704 --> 00:36:14,868
- 'Tis a b-black river.
- Perhaps it is not too deep.

450
00:36:20,882 --> 00:36:23,588
- 'Tis firm!
- Careful, Winnie.
- Hmm. Mmm.

451
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:26,341
- 'Tis firm as stone.
- Why... Why, it's a road!

452
00:36:26,472 --> 00:36:28,050
- Firm as stone
- Sisters!
- Firm as stone

453
00:36:28,182 --> 00:36:30,056
My book!

454
00:36:46,703 --> 00:36:50,287
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Come on! This is a graveyard!

455
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:54,580
It's hallowed ground.
Witches can't set foot here.

456
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,539
- He talks.
- Oh.

457
00:36:58,342 --> 00:37:00,216
Follow me!

458
00:37:07,602 --> 00:37:10,639
Over here.
I want to show you something.

459
00:37:10,772 --> 00:37:13,643
Give you an idea of exactly
what we're dealing with.

460
00:37:20,658 --> 00:37:23,576
"William Butcherson,
lost soul"?

461
00:37:23,704 --> 00:37:25,910
Billy Butcherson
was Winifred's lover,

462
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,448
but she found him sporting
with her sister Sarah,

463
00:37:28,584 --> 00:37:32,084
so she poisoned him and sewed
his mouth shut with a dull needle...

464
00:37:32,213 --> 00:37:35,001
so he couldn't tell her
secrets even in death.

465
00:37:35,133 --> 00:37:37,885
- Winifred always was the jealous type.
- You're Thackery Binx.

466
00:37:38,011 --> 00:37:40,633
- Yes.
- Huh. So the legends are true.

467
00:37:40,765 --> 00:37:43,719
Well, come along. I want
to show you something else.

468
00:37:48,482 --> 00:37:51,566
Teenagers again.
I hate Halloween.

469
00:37:51,694 --> 00:37:54,019
Man, this is the worst night of
the year. You wanna give me a hand?

470
00:37:54,155 --> 00:37:56,611
- Who... Who... Who... Who are they?
- Boys?

471
00:37:56,741 --> 00:37:58,449
Witch hunters. Observe.

472
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:03,120
They wear black robes and carry
axes to chop the wood to burn us.

473
00:38:03,248 --> 00:38:05,288
- Hold me.
- What a pretty spider.

474
00:38:07,003 --> 00:38:10,835
Sisters! Let me make
one thing perfectly clear.

475
00:38:10,966 --> 00:38:14,002
The magic
that brought us back...

476
00:38:14,136 --> 00:38:16,971
only works tonight,
on All Hallows Eve.

477
00:38:17,097 --> 00:38:20,348
When the sun comes up,
we are dust.

478
00:38:20,476 --> 00:38:21,721
- Dust?
- Toast!

479
00:38:21,853 --> 00:38:23,597
Toast?

480
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:25,972
- Pudding!
- Aaah!

481
00:38:26,108 --> 00:38:29,477
Fortunately the potion I brewed
the night we were hanged...

482
00:38:29,612 --> 00:38:32,317
will keep us alive
and young forever.

483
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:36,197
Unfortunately the recipe for
that potion is in my spell book,

484
00:38:36,328 --> 00:38:37,870
and the little wretches
have stolen it!

485
00:38:37,996 --> 00:38:41,330
Therefore, it stands to reason,
does it not, sisters dear,

486
00:38:41,458 --> 00:38:43,914
that we must find the book,
brew the potion...

487
00:38:44,045 --> 00:38:47,794
and suck the lives out of the children
of Salem before sunrise.

488
00:38:47,924 --> 00:38:53,050
Otherwise, it's curtains!
We evaporate! We cease to exist!

489
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:55,718
Dost thou comprehend?

490
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:57,392
You explained it
beautifully, Winnie.

491
00:38:57,518 --> 00:38:59,511
The way you sort of started out
with the adventure part...

492
00:38:59,646 --> 00:39:01,769
- and then you sort of slowly...
- Explained what?

493
00:39:02,941 --> 00:39:06,357
- Come! We fly!
- Fly!

494
00:39:06,487 --> 00:39:09,773
Because of me my little
sister's life was stolen.

495
00:39:09,907 --> 00:39:14,451
For years I waited for my life to end
so I could be reunited with my family.

496
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:18,874
But Winifred's curse
of immortality kept me alive.

497
00:39:19,001 --> 00:39:21,706
Then one day I figured out
what to do with my eternal life.

498
00:39:21,838 --> 00:39:25,587
Now, I'd failed Emily,
but I wouldn't fail again.

499
00:39:25,717 --> 00:39:30,011
When Winifred and her sisters returned,
I'd be there to stop them.

500
00:39:30,139 --> 00:39:33,971
So for three centuries I've guarded
the house on All Hallows Night,

501
00:39:34,101 --> 00:39:37,222
when I knew some airhead virgin
might light that candle.

502
00:39:37,355 --> 00:39:40,890
- Nice going, airhead.
- Hey, look, I'm sorry, okay?

503
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:46,236
We're talking about three ancient hags
versus the 20th century.

504
00:39:46,365 --> 00:39:49,616
- How bad can it be?
- Bad.

505
00:39:49,744 --> 00:39:52,152
- Stay out of there!
- Why?

506
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:55,741
It holds Winifred's most dangerous
spells. She must not get it.

507
00:39:55,876 --> 00:39:57,750
Well, let's torch the sucker.

508
00:40:05,095 --> 00:40:07,966
It's protected by magic.

509
00:40:14,481 --> 00:40:18,942
It's just a bunch
of hocus pocus!

510
00:40:19,069 --> 00:40:20,943
- Sarah!
- Mmm?

511
00:40:21,071 --> 00:40:23,313
Mary.

512
00:40:23,449 --> 00:40:27,198
- Max!
- Brave little virgin
who lit the candle.

513
00:40:27,328 --> 00:40:30,662
- I'll be thy friend.
- Hey, take a hike!

514
00:40:30,791 --> 00:40:32,618
Ooh! Ouch!

515
00:40:33,919 --> 00:40:38,131
- Book!
- Huh?

516
00:40:38,258 --> 00:40:40,879
- Come to Mommy!
- 'Fraid not!

517
00:40:41,011 --> 00:40:44,131
Thackery Binx,
thou mangy feline!

518
00:40:44,264 --> 00:40:46,471
- Still alive?
- And waiting for you!

519
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,973
Ohh! Thou hast waited
in vain!

520
00:40:49,103 --> 00:40:51,179
And thou will fail
to save thy friends,

521
00:40:51,314 --> 00:40:53,686
just as thou failed
to save thy sister!

522
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,318
Grab the book!

523
00:41:11,504 --> 00:41:14,873
- They can't touch us here, right?
- Well, they can't.

524
00:41:16,426 --> 00:41:18,086
I don't like the way
you said that.

525
00:41:18,219 --> 00:41:20,711
Unfaithful lover
long since dead,

526
00:41:20,847 --> 00:41:23,137
deep asleep in thy wormy bed,

527
00:41:23,267 --> 00:41:26,019
wiggle thy toes,
open thine eyes,

528
00:41:26,145 --> 00:41:29,182
twist thy fingers
toward the sky.

529
00:41:29,315 --> 00:41:31,854
Life is sweet.
Be not too shy.

530
00:41:31,985 --> 00:41:35,900
On thy feet, so sayeth I!

531
00:41:45,709 --> 00:41:47,583
Max! Max!

532
00:41:59,057 --> 00:42:00,931
Huh?

533
00:42:12,364 --> 00:42:14,404
Hi. Hello, Billy.

534
00:42:15,701 --> 00:42:18,275
Catch those children!
Get up!

535
00:42:18,413 --> 00:42:21,580
Get up! Get out of that ditch!
Faster!

536
00:42:31,135 --> 00:42:33,009
In here!

537
00:42:44,985 --> 00:42:46,360
Yes!

538
00:42:58,792 --> 00:43:00,915
- Are you okay?
- Mm-hmm.

539
00:43:01,044 --> 00:43:03,915
- What is this place, Binx?
- It's the old Salem crypt.
- Here, take the book.

540
00:43:04,048 --> 00:43:08,794
- It connects to the sewer
and up to the street.
- Oh. Uh, charming.

541
00:43:10,889 --> 00:43:14,472
- Uh, don't look up, Dani.
- Don't worry. I won't.

542
00:43:14,601 --> 00:43:17,722
Relax. I've hunted mice
down here for years.

543
00:43:17,855 --> 00:43:21,141
- Mice?
- Oh, God.
- Oh, God. Just great.

544
00:43:23,069 --> 00:43:26,486
Oh, cheese and crust!
He's lost his head!

545
00:43:26,615 --> 00:43:29,569
Ha! Damn that Thackery Binx!
Damn him!

546
00:43:29,702 --> 00:43:32,869
Billy, which way did they go?
Aaah!

547
00:43:32,997 --> 00:43:35,037
Billy, listen to me.

548
00:43:35,166 --> 00:43:39,034
Follow those children,
you maggot museum, and get my book!

549
00:43:39,171 --> 00:43:43,169
Then come find us!
We'll be ready for them!

550
00:43:43,301 --> 00:43:46,717
Quit staring at me!
Get moving down that hole!

551
00:43:46,846 --> 00:43:48,673
- Damn, damn, double damn!
- Oh!

552
00:43:48,807 --> 00:43:50,515
Broom, ho!

553
00:43:52,353 --> 00:43:54,227
This way!

554
00:43:59,569 --> 00:44:01,526
- Broom, ho.
- Ahh.

555
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:05,651
They're here.
I know they're here.

556
00:44:05,784 --> 00:44:08,537
- I know they're here,
but where are they?
- Winnie, look.

557
00:44:08,663 --> 00:44:12,364
- Sniff them out, Mary.
- Uh, they're, they're, uh...

558
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:14,458
- Oh, I can't. They've gone too far.
- Aah!

559
00:44:14,586 --> 00:44:16,875
- I've lost them!
- Aaah!
- Aah!

560
00:44:17,005 --> 00:44:21,051
I'll have your guts for garters, girl!
Confound you!

561
00:44:21,177 --> 00:44:24,012
Very well.
We must outwit them.

562
00:44:24,139 --> 00:44:26,215
- When Billy the butcher
gets here with my book,
- Book!

563
00:44:26,349 --> 00:44:27,808
- We shall be ready for them!
- Ready!

564
00:44:27,935 --> 00:44:29,927
- Sarah!
- Sarah!

565
00:44:30,062 --> 00:44:32,933
- Let us start collecting children.
- Why?

566
00:44:34,692 --> 00:44:37,563
Because, you great buffoon,
we want to live forever,

567
00:44:37,696 --> 00:44:39,320
not just until tomorrow.

568
00:44:39,448 --> 00:44:42,484
The more children's lives we snatch,
the longer we shall live!

569
00:44:42,618 --> 00:44:45,821
- Right! Let us fly!
- Fly!
- Wait!

570
00:44:45,955 --> 00:44:49,621
Sisters. I have an idea.

571
00:44:49,751 --> 00:44:54,081
Since this promises to be a most
dire and stressful evening,

572
00:44:54,214 --> 00:44:56,919
I suggest we form
a calming circle.

573
00:44:57,051 --> 00:44:59,803
- I am calm!
- Oh, sister.

574
00:44:59,929 --> 00:45:04,971
Thou art not being honest
with thyself, are we? Huh? Huh?

575
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:07,474
Come on. Come on.
Give me a smile.

576
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:20,824
Come along. Not much further.

577
00:45:20,953 --> 00:45:24,204
Let's see. Which way, which way.
I can't remember. Oh! Look, down here!

578
00:45:24,415 --> 00:45:26,538
Think soothing thoughts.

579
00:45:26,668 --> 00:45:27,783
- Rabid bats.
- Yum!

580
00:45:27,919 --> 00:45:31,454
Black death.
Mummy's scorpion pie.

581
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:33,464
- Mother.
- Mother.
- Mother.

582
00:45:40,767 --> 00:45:44,635
Bubble, bubble, I'm in trouble.

583
00:45:44,772 --> 00:45:47,180
Tell me, friend,
what is this contraption?

584
00:45:47,316 --> 00:45:50,187
I call it... a bus.

585
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,396
- A bus.
- A bus?

586
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:55,864
- And its purpose?
- To convey gorgeous creatures
such as yourselves...

587
00:45:55,993 --> 00:45:59,493
to your most forbidden desires.

588
00:46:01,165 --> 00:46:03,158
Well, fancy,

589
00:46:03,293 --> 00:46:05,167
we desire...

590
00:46:05,962 --> 00:46:08,002
children.

591
00:46:08,131 --> 00:46:11,168
Hey, that may take me a couple of tries,
but I don't think that'd be a problem.

592
00:46:11,302 --> 00:46:13,342
- Oh.
- Hop on up.
- Marvellous!

593
00:46:13,471 --> 00:46:14,846
Thank you.

594
00:46:16,015 --> 00:46:18,554
Thank you.

595
00:46:18,685 --> 00:46:20,892
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm!

596
00:46:21,021 --> 00:46:26,229
I need one of those instant ice packs.
You girls are giving me a fever! Yeow!

597
00:46:28,988 --> 00:46:31,859
- Go, Binx!
- Come here, you guys! This way!

598
00:46:39,834 --> 00:46:42,408
Hurry! Come on!

599
00:46:42,545 --> 00:46:44,419
Up the ladder!

600
00:46:46,091 --> 00:46:49,046
- Come on!
- Careful.

601
00:46:49,178 --> 00:46:54,220
Hey, buttercup, anybody ever tell you
you're very easy on the eyes?

602
00:47:00,441 --> 00:47:02,849
Binx! Look out!

603
00:47:02,985 --> 00:47:04,396
Whoa! Speed bump!

604
00:47:05,947 --> 00:47:09,613
- Binx! Ohh!
- Speed bump!

605
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,738
Oh, my God.

606
00:47:14,874 --> 00:47:17,792
- No.
- It's all my fault.

607
00:47:19,504 --> 00:47:22,624
- Max, it's not your fault.
- Ohh.

608
00:47:27,054 --> 00:47:29,925
- Look!
- Max!

609
00:47:32,477 --> 00:47:34,553
I hate it when that happens.

610
00:47:34,688 --> 00:47:36,313
Well.

611
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:39,940
I told you, I can't die.
Dani, you all right?

612
00:47:40,069 --> 00:47:41,943
- Yeah!
- Okay, then, let's go!

613
00:47:43,448 --> 00:47:46,153
Stop!

614
00:47:48,829 --> 00:47:52,115
- I smell children.
- Marvellous.

615
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:55,120
Hey, hey, cupcake, don't I get
your phone number? Your area code?

616
00:47:55,253 --> 00:47:58,836
- You want my route schedule?
- Oh, thou wouldst hate me
in the morning.

617
00:47:58,965 --> 00:48:01,801
- No, I wouldns't.
- Oh, believe me, thou wouldst.

618
00:48:01,927 --> 00:48:04,216
Party pooper.

619
00:48:05,223 --> 00:48:07,630
What is this, sisters?

620
00:48:07,767 --> 00:48:09,677
Odds bodkins.

621
00:48:11,313 --> 00:48:13,353
Farewell, mortal bus boy.

622
00:48:13,482 --> 00:48:16,567
- Oh, my.
- What are those? What's that?

623
00:48:16,694 --> 00:48:18,188
- Um...
- What is that?
- Uh, hobgoblins.
- Oh.

624
00:48:18,321 --> 00:48:20,278
Ohh! Oh.

625
00:48:20,406 --> 00:48:21,687
Bless you.

626
00:48:25,829 --> 00:48:29,364
- Enough!
- Uh, sisters, I'm very confused.

627
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:33,083
L... I smell children,
but l... I don't see children.

628
00:48:33,213 --> 00:48:36,130
L... I've lost my power!

629
00:48:36,258 --> 00:48:38,927
- Enough, enough, enough!
- Sorry.

630
00:48:39,053 --> 00:48:40,677
- We are witches. We are evil!
- Evil.

631
00:48:40,805 --> 00:48:43,889
What would Mother say
if she could see us like this?

632
00:48:44,017 --> 00:48:45,725
Oh.

633
00:48:45,852 --> 00:48:47,726
- Mother.
- Mother.

634
00:48:51,108 --> 00:48:53,564
- Master!
- Master!
- Master! Ohh!

635
00:48:53,694 --> 00:48:55,568
- Oh, my!
- He will help us!

636
00:48:55,696 --> 00:48:59,742
- What kind of costumes are these?
- Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!

637
00:48:59,868 --> 00:49:02,027
It's the Sanderson Sisters,
right?

638
00:49:02,162 --> 00:49:05,247
- At your service.
- Yes, yes.
- Haven't seen you for centuries.

639
00:49:05,374 --> 00:49:10,582
But what the heck? Why don't you come
in? Come in to the non-smoking section.

640
00:49:10,713 --> 00:49:14,462
- Come on, come on, right this way.
- Oh, I can't believe it's him!

641
00:49:14,593 --> 00:49:16,502
Don't step on my tail!

642
00:49:20,057 --> 00:49:24,103
- Officer! Officer!
- Officer, we need your help.

643
00:49:24,229 --> 00:49:26,269
What's the problem?

644
00:49:26,398 --> 00:49:28,640
- Tell him.
- Go ahead.

645
00:49:28,776 --> 00:49:31,101
Well, um...

646
00:49:31,237 --> 00:49:33,942
Well, you see, for...
I just, I just moved here.

647
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:39,864
W-Well, you see, i-it's like this.
L... I, um...

648
00:49:39,997 --> 00:49:43,615
I broke into the old Sanderson
house and I brought the witches
back from the dead.

649
00:49:43,751 --> 00:49:45,910
See, I even have the book.

650
00:49:48,131 --> 00:49:51,251
- You lit the black flame candle?
- Yeah.

651
00:49:55,473 --> 00:49:58,807
Come on. Okay, let's
get on the sidewalk.

652
00:50:01,563 --> 00:50:03,603
And he's a virgin.

653
00:50:10,907 --> 00:50:12,781
Come here.

654
00:50:15,495 --> 00:50:19,114
- Are you a virgin?
- Yeah.

655
00:50:19,249 --> 00:50:21,123
Really.

656
00:50:21,252 --> 00:50:23,328
Look, I'll get it tattooed
on my forehead, okay?

657
00:50:23,463 --> 00:50:25,586
- Officer, this is not a prank.
- Really!

658
00:50:25,715 --> 00:50:30,294
Hey! I put my life on the line
to protect this community,
and you punks pull this?

659
00:50:30,429 --> 00:50:31,971
- Get outta here.
- Come on, Dani.

660
00:50:32,097 --> 00:50:33,971
And take that cat with ya.

661
00:50:38,646 --> 00:50:43,024
- What's so funny, Eddie?
- Ahh, just a bunch of kids
pullin' my chain.

662
00:50:46,322 --> 00:50:48,196
They thought I was a real cop.

663
00:51:06,845 --> 00:51:09,218
I want you to meet
the little woman.

664
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:14,973
- He has a little woman.
- Sounds tasty.

665
00:51:15,104 --> 00:51:16,765
- Today...
- Swimming pool, swimming pool...

666
00:51:16,898 --> 00:51:19,271
- Petunia face.
- What?

667
00:51:19,401 --> 00:51:22,770
Would you stop clicking?
We have company!

668
00:51:22,905 --> 00:51:25,147
- I don't care who's here.
I'm sick and tired...
- Sisters.

669
00:51:25,283 --> 00:51:28,699
- Of these dressing-up games.
- Satan has married Medusa.
See the snakes in her hair?

670
00:51:28,828 --> 00:51:31,580
- I don't wanna play in this.
I don't wanna play.
- Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh!

671
00:51:33,625 --> 00:51:36,876
My three favourite witches.

672
00:51:37,004 --> 00:51:39,756
Aren't you broads a little old
to be trick-or-treating?

673
00:51:39,883 --> 00:51:43,548
- We'll be younger in the morning.
- Yes.

674
00:51:43,679 --> 00:51:47,593
- Yeah, sure. Me too.
- I went out with him Valentine's Day.

675
00:51:47,725 --> 00:51:49,267
Excuse me.

676
00:51:52,897 --> 00:51:56,433
Wow! Neat brooms!

677
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:02,151
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

678
00:52:02,283 --> 00:52:04,406
Forget the kids.
I'm serving you from my cauldron.

679
00:52:04,536 --> 00:52:06,742
- Winnie!
- Yes?
- For you.

680
00:52:06,871 --> 00:52:09,956
Master, I plague thee.
What about the book?

681
00:52:10,083 --> 00:52:13,453
We'll get to the book later.
Mary, go long!

682
00:52:14,922 --> 00:52:17,295
Yeah! You could be
a tight end!

683
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:22,462
Master, would thou
dance with me?

684
00:52:25,601 --> 00:52:27,641
Behold!

685
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:29,644
A torture chamber.

686
00:52:39,784 --> 00:52:43,449
Honey, I lost five pounds
according to the bathroom...

687
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:45,822
- Now there's a Stainmaster carpet...
- Master.

688
00:52:45,957 --> 00:52:48,449
That handles foot traffic
like never before.

689
00:52:50,463 --> 00:52:54,591
Okay, that's it. Party's over!

690
00:52:54,717 --> 00:52:59,594
Get out of my house!
Get outta here! Get outta my house!

691
00:52:59,723 --> 00:53:02,677
- Sorry.
- Calm down, puddin' face.

692
00:53:02,810 --> 00:53:04,886
- Shove it, Satan.
- Ohh.

693
00:53:05,021 --> 00:53:08,521
- Thou should not speak to
Master in such a manner.
- Mm-mmm.

694
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:12,351
- They call me Master.
- Wait'll you see what
I'm gonna call ya.

695
00:53:12,488 --> 00:53:16,616
Now, tart face, take your Clark bars
and get out of my house!

696
00:53:18,244 --> 00:53:20,700
Make us!

697
00:53:20,830 --> 00:53:24,034
- Yeah!
- Honey bunch.

698
00:53:24,167 --> 00:53:27,038
Ralph! Sic 'em!

699
00:53:34,513 --> 00:53:36,552
Winnie! Winnie!

700
00:53:36,682 --> 00:53:39,054
- My broom!
- My broom!
- My broom!

701
00:53:39,184 --> 00:53:42,850
Purloined! Curses!

702
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:46,813
Sisters, look. 'Tis the
chocolate-covered finger
of a man named Clark.

703
00:53:47,944 --> 00:53:49,569
Mmm. Ooh! Ugh!

704
00:53:49,696 --> 00:53:52,235
It's candy. Why would
the master give us candy?

705
00:53:52,366 --> 00:53:54,158
- Because he is not our master.
- He isn't?

706
00:53:54,285 --> 00:53:56,159
- And these are not hobgoblins.
- Ohh!

707
00:53:56,287 --> 00:53:57,947
- See?
- Ohh!
- Cool it, man!

708
00:53:58,081 --> 00:54:01,865
A child! Ohh!

709
00:54:02,002 --> 00:54:05,952
- Weirdos!
- Weirdos!
- Sisters!
- Mmm.

710
00:54:06,090 --> 00:54:09,127
- All Hallows Eve has become
a night of frolic...
- Oh.

711
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:12,012
- Where children wear costumes
and run amok!
- Oh!

712
00:54:12,139 --> 00:54:15,840
Amok! Amok, amok,
amok, amok, amok...

713
00:54:15,976 --> 00:54:19,310
- Oh, Winnie, just one child.
- No!

714
00:54:19,438 --> 00:54:23,022
Ah, great. How are we ever gonna
find Mom and Dad in this place?

715
00:54:24,986 --> 00:54:27,145
Hi, hi, hi. Hi.

716
00:54:32,829 --> 00:54:35,700
Owww! Whoo!

717
00:54:38,418 --> 00:54:41,336
Those fingers through my hair

718
00:54:41,463 --> 00:54:44,631
That sly "come hither" stare

719
00:54:44,759 --> 00:54:46,882
That strips my conscience bare

720
00:54:47,011 --> 00:54:49,051
It's witchcraft

721
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:51,090
- I'm gonna look for Mom.
- Baby!

722
00:54:51,224 --> 00:54:54,309
- And I got no defence for it
- I can't see a thing!

723
00:54:54,436 --> 00:54:57,438
- Whoo! Waah! Whoo!
- The heat is too intense for it

724
00:54:57,565 --> 00:55:02,228
What good would
common sense for it do

725
00:55:02,362 --> 00:55:04,236
- Aaah!
- It's witchcraft

726
00:55:04,364 --> 00:55:08,861
- Oh. Dad!
- It's not Dad. It's "Dadcula."

727
00:55:08,995 --> 00:55:13,704
Oh, my goodness. Who must this
charming young blood donor be?

728
00:55:13,833 --> 00:55:16,539
Dad! Something terrible
happened.

729
00:55:16,670 --> 00:55:19,707
- Dani? What's wrong? Wh-Wh...
- No, Dani's fine.

730
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:22,129
Good. Excuse me. Come here.

731
00:55:26,181 --> 00:55:28,055
Mom?

732
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:35,554
- Mom?
- Hmm?

733
00:55:35,692 --> 00:55:38,265
What are you supposed to be?

734
00:55:38,403 --> 00:55:40,811
Madonna.

735
00:55:40,948 --> 00:55:45,277
Well, you know...
Well, obviously. Don't ya think?

736
00:55:45,411 --> 00:55:49,789
Shoot, Max. Look,
whatever it is, just tell me.

737
00:55:49,916 --> 00:55:51,790
- Come here.
- What?

738
00:55:51,918 --> 00:55:54,207
This cat here, Binx, right?
He can talk.

739
00:55:54,338 --> 00:55:56,461
My brother's a virgin;
He lit the black flame candle.

740
00:55:56,590 --> 00:55:59,426
The witches are back from the dead
and they're after us. We need help.

741
00:55:59,552 --> 00:56:01,545
How much candy
have you had, honey?

742
00:56:01,679 --> 00:56:04,135
Mom, I haven't O.D.'d.
I haven't even had a piece.

743
00:56:04,266 --> 00:56:08,596
They're real witches, they can
fly, and they're gonna eat all
the kids in Salem. They're real!

744
00:56:08,729 --> 00:56:12,597
All right, let's just
find your father.

745
00:56:12,734 --> 00:56:15,651
It's such an ancient pitch

746
00:56:15,779 --> 00:56:18,946
But one I wouldn't switch

747
00:56:19,074 --> 00:56:22,159
- 'Cause there's no nicer witch
- Slither about.

748
00:56:22,286 --> 00:56:24,575
- Find them!
- Oh, no, I'll never switch

749
00:56:24,705 --> 00:56:27,826
- Ohh! Aah!
- 'Cause there's no nicer witch

750
00:56:27,959 --> 00:56:30,830
Than you

751
00:56:30,963 --> 00:56:33,501
I put a spell on you

752
00:56:33,632 --> 00:56:37,251
And now you're mine

753
00:56:37,386 --> 00:56:39,463
- Max, I love you, but enough is enough.
- Come on, Dad, if I was
gonna pull your chain...

754
00:56:39,597 --> 00:56:41,424
- Now, just calm down.
- But they're gonna come...

755
00:56:41,558 --> 00:56:44,014
- Don't you see how crazy this sounds?
- Max! Max!

756
00:56:44,144 --> 00:56:46,980
- Max, really...
- They're here! They're here!
- I ain't gonna take none
of your runnin' 'round

757
00:56:47,106 --> 00:56:50,440
- I ain't gonna take none
of your puttin' me down
- Did you find them?
- Sorry.

758
00:56:50,568 --> 00:56:53,439
- Get out there and find them.
- Nobody's here, sweetheart.

759
00:56:53,572 --> 00:56:56,608
- Here. Hold this.
- Sweetheart, nobody's here.
- Wait. Max. Max!
- Where are you going?

760
00:56:56,742 --> 00:56:59,316
- I put a spell on you
- Sarah!

761
00:56:59,453 --> 00:57:02,454
- And now you're mine
- Bye.

762
00:57:02,582 --> 00:57:06,117
- Get over here! Did you find them?
- Find who?

763
00:57:06,253 --> 00:57:08,874
I ain't lyin' No, I ain't lyin'

764
00:57:09,006 --> 00:57:11,544
- Hey, cut the music! Cut the music!
- Hey, man, I'm in the middle of a song!

765
00:57:11,675 --> 00:57:14,511
It's an emergency!
Only for a minute!

766
00:57:14,637 --> 00:57:17,425
Will everybody listen up,
please?

767
00:57:17,557 --> 00:57:19,301
- No. You're just getting
everybody worked up.
- Well, listen to him.
Listen to him. He's fine!

768
00:57:19,434 --> 00:57:22,139
- Your kids are in danger.
- What do you mean?

769
00:57:22,271 --> 00:57:25,806
300 years ago the Sanderson
Sisters bewitched people.

770
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:28,896
Now they've returned
from their grave.

771
00:57:29,028 --> 00:57:31,152
Hey, man, I'm serious!
It's not a joke!

772
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:32,823
- All right, this has gone far enough.
- No, wait a minute.

773
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:34,989
I know this sounds dumb,

774
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:36,993
but they're here tonight.

775
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:39,280
They're right over there!

776
00:57:43,378 --> 00:57:45,252
- Aah!
- Ohh.
- Wow.
- Thank you, Max,

777
00:57:47,341 --> 00:57:50,508
for that marvellous introduction.

778
00:57:52,305 --> 00:57:56,255
I put a spell on you

779
00:57:56,393 --> 00:57:58,765
And now you're mine

780
00:58:00,522 --> 00:58:04,734
You can't stop the things I do

781
00:58:04,861 --> 00:58:08,360
- I ain't lyin'
- No! No!

782
00:58:08,490 --> 00:58:09,901
- Ohh
- Don't listen to them!

783
00:58:10,033 --> 00:58:11,825
Been 300 years

784
00:58:11,952 --> 00:58:14,159
Right down to the day

785
00:58:14,288 --> 00:58:16,447
Now the witch is back

786
00:58:16,582 --> 00:58:20,201
And there's hell to pay

787
00:58:20,337 --> 00:58:24,204
I put a spell on you

788
00:58:24,341 --> 00:58:26,797
- Good joke. Happy Halloween.
Thanks a lot.
- No, man, I'm serious!

789
00:58:26,927 --> 00:58:29,882
- Yeah, yeah, I know.
You had, you had your fun.
- You gotta believe me! I'm not kidding!

790
00:58:30,014 --> 00:58:32,221
And now you're mine

791
00:58:32,350 --> 00:58:34,888
All right. Yeah, gear up.
Let's go, guys.

792
00:58:36,730 --> 00:58:39,056
Hello, Salem!

793
00:58:39,191 --> 00:58:42,358
My name's Winifred!
What's yours?

794
00:58:42,487 --> 00:58:44,895
I put a spell on you

795
00:58:45,031 --> 00:58:48,732
- And now you're gone
- Gone, gone, gone, so long

796
00:58:48,869 --> 00:58:51,574
My whammy fell on you

797
00:58:51,705 --> 00:58:55,241
- And it was strong
- So strong, so strong, so strong

798
00:58:55,376 --> 00:58:58,294
Your wretched little lives
have all been cursed

799
00:58:58,421 --> 00:59:01,589
'Cause of all the witches
working I'm the worst

800
00:59:01,717 --> 00:59:04,042
I put a spell on you

801
00:59:04,178 --> 00:59:07,464
- And now you're mine
- Binx, where are you?

802
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:11,508
Watch out, watch out
Watch out, watch out

803
00:59:14,565 --> 00:59:18,314
If you don't believe
you'd better get superstitious

804
00:59:18,444 --> 00:59:21,280
- Ask my sisters
- Mom! Dad! Thank God!
- Hey, Max, great show.

805
00:59:21,406 --> 00:59:24,193
- Cover your ears!
- Cover your ears!
- I put a spell on you

806
00:59:26,119 --> 00:59:28,278
What? Ho-ho! Uh-oh!

807
00:59:28,414 --> 00:59:32,661
- I put a spell on you
- Oh, I wish we had a camera.

808
00:59:32,794 --> 00:59:35,878
Ah-say-into-pie
Oppa-maybe-uppen-die

809
00:59:36,006 --> 00:59:39,007
Ah-say-into-pie
Oppa-maybe-uppen-die

810
00:59:39,134 --> 00:59:42,171
- In-kama-koray-ah-ma
- In-kama-koray-ah-ma

811
00:59:42,304 --> 00:59:43,715
- Hey
- Hey!
- High
- High!

812
00:59:43,848 --> 00:59:45,223
- Say
- Say!
- Bye
- Bye!

813
00:59:45,350 --> 00:59:49,348
Bye

814
00:59:49,479 --> 00:59:51,187
Bye-bye

815
00:59:57,572 --> 01:00:01,440
Dance! Dance!
Dance until you die!

816
01:00:10,169 --> 01:00:12,043
Oh, Binx, come on!

817
01:00:20,139 --> 01:00:23,306
- This is really bad!
- Max, come on! Calm down!

818
01:00:23,434 --> 01:00:26,389
Look, I want you to take Dani
back to your house and don't
let her out of your sight!

819
01:00:26,521 --> 01:00:28,763
Max, I'm not leaving you.

820
01:00:30,818 --> 01:00:33,190
Okay, guys, who's goin'
for the jacuzzi?

821
01:00:35,156 --> 01:00:37,279
Yeah, Angelo, too bad.

822
01:00:41,163 --> 01:00:44,200
- Uh-oh.
- Get down!

823
01:00:47,045 --> 01:00:48,539
- I smell...
- Yes?

824
01:00:48,671 --> 01:00:50,878
- Winnie, I smell...
- Yes? Yes?

825
01:00:51,007 --> 01:00:54,377
I smell scrod.

826
01:00:54,511 --> 01:00:56,385
Scrod. You know.
It's a bottom dweller.

827
01:00:56,514 --> 01:00:58,720
You cook it sometimes with lovely
bread crumbs, little bit of margarine.

828
01:00:58,850 --> 01:01:00,641
Or oil. Olive oil is good.

829
01:01:00,768 --> 01:01:04,636
But you have to cook it at 350 degrees
or else it tastes really... Aah!

830
01:01:04,773 --> 01:01:07,478
Sarah. Sarah!

831
01:01:18,455 --> 01:01:20,329
I have an idea.

832
01:01:26,422 --> 01:01:29,590
- What is this place?
- Mmm, it reeks of children.

833
01:01:29,718 --> 01:01:32,126
It is a prison for children.

834
01:01:40,856 --> 01:01:43,608
Welcome to High School Hell.

835
01:01:43,734 --> 01:01:47,103
I'm your host,
Boris Karloff Jr.

836
01:01:49,449 --> 01:01:52,366
This way. I know I'm right.

837
01:01:52,494 --> 01:01:55,448
It's time to meet
our three contestants:

838
01:01:55,581 --> 01:01:59,875
Sarah, Mary
and Winifred Sanderson.

839
01:02:00,002 --> 01:02:02,375
Read any good spell books
lately?

840
01:02:04,674 --> 01:02:06,548
Hag tracks!

841
01:02:08,428 --> 01:02:10,302
Get him!

842
01:02:12,934 --> 01:02:15,603
Hello. Welcome to the library.

843
01:02:24,739 --> 01:02:26,815
I would like a book.

844
01:02:30,871 --> 01:02:33,196
Shh! Shh! Shh!

845
01:02:33,332 --> 01:02:35,289
What kind of book
are you looking for?

846
01:02:37,503 --> 01:02:39,959
We've got them!
We've got them, we've got them!

847
01:02:43,218 --> 01:02:46,219
- What? Hello.
- I am looking for a children's book
- Yes?

848
01:02:55,357 --> 01:02:57,646
- Wretches!
- It's warm in here.

849
01:02:57,776 --> 01:02:59,650
Fire. Fire!

850
01:03:01,489 --> 01:03:02,864
Aah! It's hot! It's hot!

851
01:03:09,873 --> 01:03:13,077
Farewell, Winifred Sanderson!
Ha ha!

852
01:03:13,210 --> 01:03:15,832
- Yes! Yay!
- Burn! Burn! All right!

853
01:03:15,963 --> 01:03:19,167
Whoo! Whoo!

854
01:03:21,303 --> 01:03:22,927
Yeah! All right!

855
01:03:24,473 --> 01:03:26,347
- Yes!
- Yes!

856
01:03:27,727 --> 01:03:29,601
Yes!

857
01:03:37,237 --> 01:03:40,108
We did it, Binx.
We stopped them.

858
01:03:40,241 --> 01:03:45,782
I've wanted to do that for 300
years, since they took Emily.

859
01:03:49,919 --> 01:03:52,291
You really miss her, don't you?

860
01:03:52,421 --> 01:03:56,633
Man, you can't keep blaming yourself
for that. That happened so long ago.

861
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:58,836
Take good care of Dani, Max.

862
01:03:58,970 --> 01:04:03,467
You'll never know how precious
she is until you lose her.

863
01:04:07,939 --> 01:04:12,732
Hey, Binx! Where do you
think you're goin'?

864
01:04:12,861 --> 01:04:15,816
You're a Dennison now, buddy.
One of us.

865
01:04:15,948 --> 01:04:18,653
Come on, Binx, let's go home.

866
01:04:18,785 --> 01:04:21,074
Home.

867
01:04:22,247 --> 01:04:23,907
Home.

868
01:04:30,548 --> 01:04:33,668
Mom? Dad?

869
01:04:33,802 --> 01:04:37,052
We got a new cat! Mom?

870
01:04:38,807 --> 01:04:41,678
Well, I guess they're
still partying. Come on in.

871
01:04:51,655 --> 01:04:53,862
You're my kitty now.

872
01:04:53,991 --> 01:04:58,286
You'll have milk and tuna fish every
day, and you'll only hunt mice for fun.

873
01:04:58,413 --> 01:05:02,874
You're going to turn me into
one of those fat, useless,
contented house cats.

874
01:05:03,001 --> 01:05:04,875
You betcha.

875
01:05:07,673 --> 01:05:12,300
- Yeah.
- You know, Binx,
I'll always take care of you.

876
01:05:12,429 --> 01:05:14,920
My children will
take care of you too.

877
01:05:15,057 --> 01:05:20,396
And then their children after
that, and theirs after that,

878
01:05:20,521 --> 01:05:24,733
forever and ever...

879
01:05:24,859 --> 01:05:27,232
and ever.

880
01:05:51,890 --> 01:05:56,517
Hello. I want my book.

881
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:06,654
- You wanna smash some pumpkins?
- Nah.

882
01:06:06,782 --> 01:06:09,949
Well, then you wanna look in
windows and watch babes undress?

883
01:06:10,077 --> 01:06:12,747
It's 3:00.
They're undressed already.

884
01:06:16,376 --> 01:06:19,793
- Well, then you think of something!
- I don't feel so good.

885
01:06:19,922 --> 01:06:23,126
- It's 'cause you're eatin'
too much candy, ya oinker!
- Seek them out, Mary.

886
01:06:23,259 --> 01:06:25,585
- Seek them out.
- Okay, Winnie.

887
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:34,312
- Yes!
- Yo, witch. Get your face off my shoe.

888
01:06:34,438 --> 01:06:37,808
- Uhh, wrong boy.
- Natch!
- Ohh, sorry, Winnie.

889
01:06:37,942 --> 01:06:42,023
Why, why, why was I cursed
with such idiot sisters?

890
01:06:43,782 --> 01:06:46,570
- Just lucky, I guess.
- Ohh!

891
01:06:46,702 --> 01:06:51,412
Oh, man, how come it's always
the ugly chicks that stay out late?

892
01:06:54,044 --> 01:06:56,500
Chicks?

893
01:06:56,630 --> 01:07:00,925
We haven't much time left!
We shall have to... We shall have
to make the potion from memory!

894
01:07:01,052 --> 01:07:03,211
Hey! Let us outta here!

895
01:07:03,346 --> 01:07:06,846
- Yeah, we're really sorry.
- We think you're really cute.

896
01:07:06,975 --> 01:07:08,719
- Hush!
- Aaah!

897
01:07:08,852 --> 01:07:11,522
- I've got to think.
- Ohh.

898
01:07:11,647 --> 01:07:14,483
- Please!
- Remember. Remember.

899
01:07:14,609 --> 01:07:16,602
- Remember, Winnie, remember.
- Remember, Winnie, remember.

900
01:07:16,736 --> 01:07:19,654
- Remember, Winnie, remember.
- Remember, Winnie, remember.
- Now I remember!

901
01:07:19,781 --> 01:07:21,691
- I was here.
- Yes.
- The book was there.
- Uh...

902
01:07:21,825 --> 01:07:25,526
You, Mary, you were here. Sarah, you
were in the back, dancing idiotically.

903
01:07:25,663 --> 01:07:27,905
- And the book said...
- Yes?
- I remember it like it was yesterday.

904
01:07:28,041 --> 01:07:32,953
- Yes?
- Oil of boil...
- Mmm?
- And a dead man's nose.

905
01:07:33,088 --> 01:07:35,295
- Dead man's toes!
- She's trying to concentrate!

906
01:07:35,424 --> 01:07:37,132
- No.
- Go! Go, go, go!

907
01:07:37,260 --> 01:07:39,632
- His thumbs.
- Thumbs? Could be thumbs.
- Or was it his gums?

908
01:07:39,762 --> 01:07:42,301
- I don't know. Thumbs, gums.
- Or dead man's buns.
- Dead man's buns. Buns.

909
01:07:42,432 --> 01:07:43,891
- Sounds like...
- Mums?
- Mums.

910
01:07:44,017 --> 01:07:45,891
- Funs.
- Funs.
- Chungs?
- Chungs? Mmm!

911
01:07:46,019 --> 01:07:49,306
- It's chungs!
- Chungs?
- Dead man's chungs!

912
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:52,014
There is no such thing
as chungs.

913
01:07:52,151 --> 01:07:53,729
- You're right.
- I am? I'm right?

914
01:07:53,862 --> 01:07:56,898
It's no use. I don't
remember the ingredients.

915
01:07:57,032 --> 01:08:00,816
L... l... I've got to
have my book!

916
01:08:04,791 --> 01:08:09,003
- Leave him alone!
- Aaah! I'm gonna puke!

917
01:08:10,547 --> 01:08:13,217
Book!

918
01:08:13,342 --> 01:08:17,210
Come home
or make thyself known!

919
01:08:33,824 --> 01:08:36,196
- Hi.
- Hi.

920
01:08:41,791 --> 01:08:44,543
Oh, my God. It's 5:00.

921
01:08:44,669 --> 01:08:47,540
My parents are gonna kill me.

922
01:08:47,673 --> 01:08:51,801
- I should go.
- I wish you could stay.

923
01:08:57,517 --> 01:08:59,676
Poor Binx.

924
01:08:59,811 --> 01:09:02,267
Yeah. Poor Binx.

925
01:09:04,525 --> 01:09:08,393
- We owe him a lot.
- Yeah.

926
01:09:08,530 --> 01:09:12,398
Look, cou... could we find
some kind of way to help him?

927
01:09:15,121 --> 01:09:17,612
The book.

928
01:09:17,748 --> 01:09:20,619
The witches used it to put
the spell on him.

929
01:09:20,752 --> 01:09:23,623
Maybe there's a way in here
to take it off.

930
01:09:25,215 --> 01:09:29,000
Mmm, I don't know.
Binx told us not to open it.

931
01:09:29,136 --> 01:09:32,007
Well, the witches are dead.
What harm could it do?

932
01:09:37,229 --> 01:09:39,899
Well, just be careful.

933
01:09:40,024 --> 01:09:42,480
I will.

934
01:09:42,610 --> 01:09:45,232
- Hold my hand.
- All right.

935
01:09:49,493 --> 01:09:50,868
Nothing weird so far.

936
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,037
Winnie, oh, do you wanna hit me?
Would that cheer you up?

937
01:09:59,170 --> 01:10:03,299
- Okay. There you go.
- This is the end.

938
01:10:03,425 --> 01:10:05,714
- No.
- I feel it.
- Okay.

939
01:10:05,845 --> 01:10:10,756
We are doomed. I feel
the icy breath of death upon my neck.

940
01:10:12,561 --> 01:10:14,684
- Mary?
- What?
- Take me to the window.

941
01:10:14,813 --> 01:10:16,308
- This one?
- I wish to say goodbye.

942
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:17,899
Yes, Winnie.

943
01:10:18,025 --> 01:10:19,401
- Goodbye.
- Bye-bye.

944
01:10:19,527 --> 01:10:22,065
- Goodbye, cruel world.
- Bye-bye, cruel world.

945
01:10:22,197 --> 01:10:24,273
- Goodbye to life.
- Bye-bye, life.

946
01:10:24,407 --> 01:10:27,077
- Goodbye, goodbye.
- Goodbye-bye.

947
01:10:27,202 --> 01:10:29,242
- Goodbye to all that.
- To all that.

948
01:10:31,707 --> 01:10:34,199
- Sister! Observe!
- What?
- They've opened it!

949
01:10:34,335 --> 01:10:36,957
Ha ha! Just when our time
was running out!

950
01:10:37,088 --> 01:10:41,917
- Come! We fly!
- We fly! On what do we fly?

951
01:10:52,231 --> 01:10:55,647
Ahh! Into the night! Ahh!

952
01:11:10,418 --> 01:11:12,292
Winnie?

953
01:11:14,422 --> 01:11:17,874
Broom, ho!

954
01:11:18,010 --> 01:11:19,967
Ohh!

955
01:11:23,516 --> 01:11:25,972
Oh, listen to this.

956
01:11:26,102 --> 01:11:30,480
Only a circle of salt can protect
thy victims from thy power.

957
01:11:39,534 --> 01:11:41,990
- We were just trying to help you.
- Well, don't!

958
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:45,205
Nothing good can come
from this book. You got it?

959
01:11:57,346 --> 01:11:59,719
- Maybe we should go now.
- Okay.

960
01:12:10,361 --> 01:12:12,437
Mom? Dad?

961
01:12:16,827 --> 01:12:19,662
Still not home. That's weird.

962
01:12:19,788 --> 01:12:22,873
Must be having a great time.

963
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,918
I don't know.
Something's not right.

964
01:12:26,045 --> 01:12:29,711
I'd feel a lot safer walking
home if we had some salt.

965
01:12:44,191 --> 01:12:46,231
Salt.

966
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:48,234
Ahh!

967
01:12:49,864 --> 01:12:51,904
What's it say?

968
01:12:52,033 --> 01:12:55,699
Uh, it says form a circle of
salt to protect from zombies,

969
01:12:55,829 --> 01:12:58,155
witches and old boyfriends.

970
01:12:58,290 --> 01:13:00,164
Yeah? And what about
new boyfriends?

971
01:13:10,095 --> 01:13:12,088
Dani.

972
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:16,474
Dani!

973
01:13:24,445 --> 01:13:26,272
Max, the book is gone.

974
01:13:27,657 --> 01:13:30,528
I'm telling you,
something's weird.

975
01:13:32,913 --> 01:13:34,372
- Dani, wake up.
- Trick or treat!

976
01:13:36,667 --> 01:13:39,455
- Looking for this?
- Or this?

977
01:13:46,345 --> 01:13:48,219
Boy down.

978
01:13:50,266 --> 01:13:53,018
Salt! Ha!

979
01:13:53,144 --> 01:13:56,311
- What a clever little white witch.
- Yeah!

980
01:13:56,439 --> 01:13:59,192
But it will not save
thy friends. No.

981
01:13:59,318 --> 01:14:02,272
Come, sisters. The candle's
magic is almost spent.

982
01:14:02,405 --> 01:14:04,978
- Dawn approaches.
- Bye-bye.

983
01:14:05,116 --> 01:14:07,903
Max!

984
01:14:08,036 --> 01:14:12,081
Put me down! Let me go!
Aaah! Put me down!

985
01:14:19,048 --> 01:14:21,172
Dani? Dani?

986
01:14:25,055 --> 01:14:27,760
Dani!

987
01:14:32,105 --> 01:14:34,181
Max. Max.

988
01:14:34,316 --> 01:14:37,270
- Ohh.
- Get up.
- Ohh.
- Are you okay?

989
01:14:37,403 --> 01:14:39,941
- Ohh.
- Come on, get up.
- Where's Dani?

990
01:14:40,740 --> 01:14:44,358
Use thy voice, Sarah!
Fill the sky!

991
01:14:44,494 --> 01:14:47,365
Bring the little brats to die!

992
01:14:52,294 --> 01:14:55,545
Come, little children

993
01:14:55,673 --> 01:14:59,802
I'll take thee away

994
01:14:59,928 --> 01:15:02,846
Into a land

995
01:15:02,973 --> 01:15:07,470
Of enchantment

996
01:15:07,603 --> 01:15:11,055
Come, little children

997
01:15:11,191 --> 01:15:15,106
The time's come to play

998
01:15:15,237 --> 01:15:18,737
Here in my garden

999
01:15:18,866 --> 01:15:23,944
Of magic

1000
01:15:29,712 --> 01:15:31,087
- Dani!
- Dani!

1001
01:15:38,305 --> 01:15:41,092
Hey! Hey, you guys!

1002
01:15:41,225 --> 01:15:45,306
Don't listen to her!
Hey! Up here!

1003
01:15:45,438 --> 01:15:48,807
- Don't listen to her!
- Max! Max, I've figured it out.

1004
01:15:48,942 --> 01:15:52,062
- What?
- Winifred said...

1005
01:15:52,196 --> 01:15:54,734
the candle's magic
will soon be spent...

1006
01:15:54,865 --> 01:15:57,191
and dawn approaches.

1007
01:15:57,326 --> 01:16:01,455
The black flame candle only brought
them back for this one Halloween night.

1008
01:16:01,581 --> 01:16:04,452
And unless they can steal
the lives of children,

1009
01:16:04,585 --> 01:16:08,085
when the sun comes up
they're dust.

1010
01:16:08,214 --> 01:16:10,919
Yeah, but how can we
make the sun come up?

1011
01:16:11,050 --> 01:16:14,254
They've got Dani.

1012
01:16:14,387 --> 01:16:16,713
We need a miracle.

1013
01:16:34,452 --> 01:16:36,908
The children are coming.

1014
01:16:37,038 --> 01:16:40,242
- Ohh! Well done, sister Sarah.
- Mmm! Good, good, good, good!

1015
01:16:44,755 --> 01:16:46,914
Let me out of here!

1016
01:16:48,718 --> 01:16:51,755
Hurry, okay? Oh, watch out!

1017
01:16:51,888 --> 01:16:55,839
Come on! Get out of the way!
Move it!

1018
01:16:58,354 --> 01:17:02,055
- Aaah! I'm gonna ralph.
- Open up!

1019
01:17:02,192 --> 01:17:04,517
No more candy, please!
Oww! Oww!

1020
01:17:04,653 --> 01:17:08,105
- Soon the lives of all thy
little friends will be mine,
- Oww! Oww!

1021
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:11,028
And I shall be young
and beautiful again forever.

1022
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:15,289
It doesn't matter how young or old
you are! You sold your soul!

1023
01:17:15,415 --> 01:17:19,413
You're the ugliest thing that's
ever lived, and you know it!

1024
01:17:20,796 --> 01:17:23,667
You die first.

1025
01:17:44,281 --> 01:17:46,488
- No!
- Ahh! 'Tis ready!

1026
01:17:46,617 --> 01:17:48,491
- Pry open her mouth.
- Gladly.

1027
01:17:48,619 --> 01:17:50,577
- Dani, don't drink it!
- Shut up, you!

1028
01:17:50,705 --> 01:17:52,614
- Don't drink it, Dani!
- Come on, open your mouth.

1029
01:17:52,749 --> 01:17:55,786
- Open up...
- Aah!
- Aah! She bit me!

1030
01:17:59,507 --> 01:18:01,583
- She bit me, Winnie!
- Prepare to die!

1031
01:18:02,593 --> 01:18:04,385
- Again.
- You!

1032
01:18:04,512 --> 01:18:07,597
- You have no powers here, you fool!
- Hollywood!

1033
01:18:07,724 --> 01:18:10,679
- Maybe not!
- Come here!
- But there's a power
greater than your magic,

1034
01:18:10,811 --> 01:18:13,184
- and that's knowledge!
- Hey, come on, man!

1035
01:18:13,314 --> 01:18:16,814
- And there's one thing that
I know that you don't!
- Ohh!

1036
01:18:16,943 --> 01:18:18,817
And what is that, dude?

1037
01:18:20,405 --> 01:18:22,612
Daylight savings time.

1038
01:18:22,741 --> 01:18:25,149
"Daylight savings time."

1039
01:18:26,788 --> 01:18:29,824
- Winnie!
- Aaah!
- Aaah!

1040
01:18:29,958 --> 01:18:32,449
The sun! No!

1041
01:18:32,586 --> 01:18:36,002
- Max! Get me out of here!
- The sun!

1042
01:18:39,177 --> 01:18:40,801
It hurts!

1043
01:18:43,306 --> 01:18:45,880
- Don't worry, Binx!
I've got you! I'm here!
- Aah! Hot! Hot cat! Hot cat!

1044
01:18:46,018 --> 01:18:48,639
Hey! Let me outta here!

1045
01:18:50,189 --> 01:18:54,318
Help! Help! Hey! Hollywood!
Help us out here.

1046
01:18:58,907 --> 01:19:02,822
- Tubular.
- Aaah! Aaah!

1047
01:19:04,205 --> 01:19:06,827
- Yes!
- Let me outta here, man!

1048
01:19:06,958 --> 01:19:09,710
- Come on, Dani, let's go!
- Let me outta here, man!

1049
01:19:09,836 --> 01:19:13,004
Max! I wanna see her
turn to dust!

1050
01:19:16,302 --> 01:19:18,176
Pump it!

1051
01:19:20,473 --> 01:19:22,347
Allison!

1052
01:19:35,657 --> 01:19:37,697
I am alive!

1053
01:19:37,826 --> 01:19:40,234
Damn that boy.
He's tricked us again.

1054
01:19:40,371 --> 01:19:43,408
- Oh, you're right. You're always right.
I don't know how you do it...
- It's my curse!

1055
01:19:43,541 --> 01:19:48,418
- That, and you two. Get off me,
you thundering oafs!
- Ohh! Sorry.

1056
01:19:48,547 --> 01:19:52,545
Look! The candle's almost out,
and my potion...

1057
01:19:52,677 --> 01:19:54,883
My beautiful potion.

1058
01:19:55,013 --> 01:20:00,221
Look! There's just
enough left for one child.

1059
01:20:00,352 --> 01:20:01,894
Get the vial.

1060
01:20:03,564 --> 01:20:05,806
Come on! Move it!

1061
01:20:05,942 --> 01:20:07,816
Oh, joy! What luck!

1062
01:20:07,944 --> 01:20:10,779
This is perfect for that
little towheaded brat.

1063
01:20:10,906 --> 01:20:13,907
- We have a child.
- Him!
- Him!

1064
01:20:14,034 --> 01:20:18,744
And look, Winnie, more children
are arriving. Come on in.

1065
01:20:18,873 --> 01:20:24,248
Winnie. Winnie, we will make more potion
because, Winnie, we have the book!

1066
01:20:24,379 --> 01:20:26,087
We haven't the time!

1067
01:20:26,215 --> 01:20:29,916
Besides, I want to get that little
rat-faced kid that called me...

1068
01:20:30,052 --> 01:20:33,007
- Oh! Oh, don't say it.
Don't even say it.
- Ugly?

1069
01:20:35,892 --> 01:20:39,226
- Oh, honey. I know.
- She really hurt my feelings.

1070
01:20:39,355 --> 01:20:42,641
- She's jealous.
- She doesn't even know me!
- I know. I know. And she said...

1071
01:20:44,777 --> 01:20:46,936
- You know, I always wanted a child.
- I know.

1072
01:20:47,072 --> 01:20:48,946
- And now I think I'll have one.
- Mm-hmm?

1073
01:20:49,074 --> 01:20:50,901
On toast!

1074
01:20:52,411 --> 01:20:56,030
- Step on it, Max!
- Are they following us?

1075
01:20:58,460 --> 01:21:00,785
- No.
- Good.

1076
01:21:09,889 --> 01:21:13,140
Pull over! Let me see
your driver's permit.

1077
01:21:22,111 --> 01:21:26,573
Resisting arrest?
Aah! Whoa!

1078
01:21:26,700 --> 01:21:30,484
- Yee-hah!
- Way to go!
- Whoo-hoo!

1079
01:21:35,668 --> 01:21:37,661
Hurry! Hurry!

1080
01:21:37,796 --> 01:21:40,168
- Run!
- Go, go, go, go, go!

1081
01:21:40,299 --> 01:21:43,004
Come on! Let's get a move on!

1082
01:21:46,639 --> 01:21:48,549
- Max!
- No, wait, Dani!

1083
01:21:53,981 --> 01:21:56,899
Run, Dani, run! Come on!

1084
01:21:58,194 --> 01:22:00,981
Billy! Billy, listen to me!

1085
01:22:01,114 --> 01:22:05,776
Kill him if you must!
Just bring me that child, that Dani!

1086
01:22:05,911 --> 01:22:10,620
And put some wiggle in it,
you putrid, festering sore!

1087
01:22:10,750 --> 01:22:13,241
Don't dawdle! Come along now!

1088
01:22:15,171 --> 01:22:18,671
Come along now! Kill him!

1089
01:22:18,801 --> 01:22:20,710
Do it now!

1090
01:22:20,845 --> 01:22:25,258
Wench! Trollop!

1091
01:22:25,391 --> 01:22:30,387
You bucktoothed,
mop-riding firefly from hell!

1092
01:22:30,522 --> 01:22:34,567
- Aaah!
- I've waited centuries to say that.

1093
01:22:34,694 --> 01:22:37,066
Well, say what you want.
Just don't breathe on me.

1094
01:22:37,196 --> 01:22:40,032
Billy! I killed you once!

1095
01:22:40,158 --> 01:22:43,777
I shall kill you again,
you maggoty malfeasance!

1096
01:22:43,912 --> 01:22:47,613
Hang on to your head!

1097
01:22:50,712 --> 01:22:53,001
- Max, run!
- Max, come on, move!
Move out of the way!

1098
01:22:53,131 --> 01:22:57,212
Wait, wait! Wait! Wait!
No! No. No.

1099
01:22:57,344 --> 01:23:00,429
He's a good zombie. Come on.

1100
01:23:02,934 --> 01:23:06,635
Come on, then. We'll have to hold them
out until dawn. It's our only hope.

1101
01:23:06,772 --> 01:23:07,685
Hi, Billy.

1102
01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:21,868
- You'll be safe in here.
- Thank you.

1103
01:23:21,997 --> 01:23:25,117
- You okay, Dani?
- Yeah, fine.

1104
01:23:25,251 --> 01:23:29,629
- All right then.
- Ooh.
- In we go. Ahh.

1105
01:23:42,103 --> 01:23:44,559
Here they come!
Billy, grab Dani!

1106
01:23:44,690 --> 01:23:46,813
Max, Allison, spread out!

1107
01:23:55,994 --> 01:23:58,995
For the last time,
prepare to meet thy doom!

1108
01:24:02,460 --> 01:24:06,672
You little pest.
I've had enough of you.

1109
01:24:33,996 --> 01:24:36,072
- Billy!
- Go to hell!

1110
01:24:36,206 --> 01:24:39,374
Oh, I've been there, thank you.
I found it quite lovely.

1111
01:24:47,344 --> 01:24:49,467
- Ohh! Aah!
- Huh?

1112
01:25:02,736 --> 01:25:06,236
- Billy, I think you dropped this.
- Uh-huh.

1113
01:25:06,366 --> 01:25:08,240
Oh, God.

1114
01:25:13,207 --> 01:25:14,784
Max!

1115
01:25:18,254 --> 01:25:19,630
Dani!

1116
01:25:21,716 --> 01:25:23,508
Bye-bye, big brother!

1117
01:25:30,518 --> 01:25:34,267
- All right, you little trollimog.
- Aaah!

1118
01:25:34,397 --> 01:25:36,271
Hold on, Dani!

1119
01:25:39,862 --> 01:25:43,481
This'll teach ya
to call people ugly!

1120
01:25:43,616 --> 01:25:47,317
Open your mouth!
Open your mouth, I say!

1121
01:25:47,454 --> 01:25:50,159
Ohh! Confound you!

1122
01:25:55,421 --> 01:25:58,458
- Give me that vial!
- Put her down or I'll smash it!

1123
01:25:58,591 --> 01:26:01,628
- Aaah!
- Smash it and she dies!

1124
01:26:01,762 --> 01:26:03,470
- Max!
- No!

1125
01:26:07,351 --> 01:26:09,724
- Max, no!
- Ohh!

1126
01:26:14,109 --> 01:26:17,810
Now you have no choice!
You have to take me.

1127
01:26:24,746 --> 01:26:29,492
What a fool to give up
thy life for thy sister's.

1128
01:26:29,627 --> 01:26:33,672
- Go!
- Aaah!

1129
01:26:33,798 --> 01:26:35,755
- Dani!
- Dani!
- Oh, Billy!

1130
01:26:35,884 --> 01:26:38,589
- Billy!
- Are you okay? Ohh!

1131
01:26:40,389 --> 01:26:43,011
- Put him down!
- Boy!
- Max!

1132
01:26:53,112 --> 01:26:55,864
Max!

1133
01:26:57,158 --> 01:26:59,032
Hallowed ground!
Hallowed ground!

1134
01:26:59,160 --> 01:27:02,576
- Sisters!
- Winnie, I'm coming!

1135
01:27:08,337 --> 01:27:12,632
Pull! Pull! Harder! Harder!

1136
01:27:12,759 --> 01:27:14,253
Come on! Come on!

1137
01:27:14,386 --> 01:27:18,716
I'm going to teach you a lesson
you'll never forget!

1138
01:27:18,849 --> 01:27:21,222
Sarah!

1139
01:27:21,352 --> 01:27:23,226
Help!

1140
01:27:26,358 --> 01:27:28,600
- Here!
- Pull!
- Harder!

1141
01:27:30,070 --> 01:27:32,526
Hold on, Max! Hold on!

1142
01:27:36,077 --> 01:27:38,070
Let go now!

1143
01:28:29,638 --> 01:28:34,300
Book!

1144
01:28:44,988 --> 01:28:47,065
Winnie!

1145
01:28:47,199 --> 01:28:48,148
Goodbye.

1146
01:28:49,786 --> 01:28:51,328
Uh-oh.

1147
01:28:51,454 --> 01:28:53,696
Ooh. Bye-bye.

1148
01:29:11,977 --> 01:29:13,935
Huh?

1149
01:29:16,816 --> 01:29:19,983
Oh, yeah.

1150
01:29:20,112 --> 01:29:22,235
Ha! Max!

1151
01:29:29,914 --> 01:29:32,869
Max? Are you okay?

1152
01:29:34,837 --> 01:29:36,711
Yeah, I think so.

1153
01:29:38,758 --> 01:29:43,504
- You saved my life.
- Well, I had to. I'm your big brother.

1154
01:29:43,638 --> 01:29:46,723
- I love you, jerkface.
- I love you too.

1155
01:29:50,855 --> 01:29:52,563
Come on.

1156
01:29:59,448 --> 01:30:02,485
Bye, Billy. Have a nice sleep.

1157
01:30:02,618 --> 01:30:04,907
- Hey, Billy.
- Huh?

1158
01:30:06,664 --> 01:30:08,622
Thanks.

1159
01:30:15,549 --> 01:30:17,875
Where's Binx?

1160
01:30:18,011 --> 01:30:21,462
Binx? Binx.

1161
01:30:24,226 --> 01:30:26,100
Binx!

1162
01:30:28,981 --> 01:30:32,932
- He's gone. He's gone, Dani.
- But he can't die, remember?

1163
01:30:35,530 --> 01:30:38,532
Wake up, Binx! Binx, wake up!

1164
01:30:40,327 --> 01:30:42,451
Like last time!

1165
01:30:48,086 --> 01:30:52,665
Dani. Come on.
Please don't be sad for me.

1166
01:30:54,302 --> 01:30:58,347
- Binx? Is that you?
- Yeah.

1167
01:31:01,935 --> 01:31:05,471
The witches are dead.
My soul's finally free.

1168
01:31:11,571 --> 01:31:14,145
You freed me, Dani. Thank you.

1169
01:31:15,826 --> 01:31:19,871
Hey, Max, thanks for
lighting the candle.

1170
01:31:22,834 --> 01:31:26,583
Thackery! Thackery Binx!

1171
01:31:31,302 --> 01:31:32,417
It's Emily.

1172
01:31:37,058 --> 01:31:39,764
I shall always be with you.

1173
01:32:03,130 --> 01:32:05,835
Thackery Binx,
what took thee so long?

1174
01:32:05,966 --> 01:32:07,544
I'm sorry, Emily.

1175
01:32:07,677 --> 01:32:12,054
I had to wait 300 years for
a virgin to light a candle.

1176
01:32:43,801 --> 01:32:46,755
I put a spell on you

1177
01:32:50,475 --> 01:32:53,227
I put a spell on you

1178
01:32:56,190 --> 01:32:59,061
- I thought L.A. Was a party town.
- Yeah!

1179
01:32:59,193 --> 01:33:00,937
- Whoo.
- Wow!

1180
01:33:02,072 --> 01:33:04,777
Row, row, row your boat

1181
01:33:04,908 --> 01:33:07,779
- Gently down the stream
- Row, row, row your boat

1182
01:33:07,911 --> 01:33:10,533
- Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
- Gently down the stream

1183
01:33:10,665 --> 01:33:13,286
- Life is but a dream
- Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily

1184
01:33:13,418 --> 01:33:16,289
- Life is but a dream
- Row, row, row your boat

1185
01:33:16,421 --> 01:33:18,794
Gently down the stream

1186
01:33:18,924 --> 01:33:21,546
♫ I put a spell on you

1187
01:33:21,677 --> 01:33:25,177
♫ - And now you're gone
- Gone, gone, gone, so long

1188
01:33:25,306 --> 01:33:28,094
♫ My whammy fell on you

1189
01:33:28,226 --> 01:33:31,643
♫ - And it was strong
- So strong, so strong, so strong

1190
01:33:31,772 --> 01:33:34,809
♫ Your wretched little lives
have all been cursed

1191
01:33:34,942 --> 01:33:38,109
♫ 'Cause of all the witches
working I'm the worst

1192
01:33:38,238 --> 01:33:40,563
♫ I put a spell on you

1193
01:33:40,699 --> 01:33:43,985
♫ And now you're mine

1194
01:33:45,621 --> 01:33:48,741
♫ Watch out, watch out
Watch out, watch out

1195
01:33:48,875 --> 01:33:50,998
♫ Oh, she ain't lyin'

1196
01:33:51,127 --> 01:33:54,828
♫ If you don't believe
you'd better get superstitious

1197
01:33:54,965 --> 01:33:57,836
♫ - Ask my sisters
- Ooh, she's vicious

1198
01:33:57,968 --> 01:34:01,801
♫ Uhh! Eee!
I put a spell on you

1199
01:34:01,931 --> 01:34:04,767
♫ A wicked spell

1200
01:34:04,893 --> 01:34:09,105
♫ I put a spell on you Sisters!

1201
01:34:09,231 --> 01:34:12,398
♫ Ah-say-into-pie
Oppa-maybe-uppen-die

1202
01:34:12,526 --> 01:34:15,528
♫ Ah-say-into-pie
Oppa-maybe-uppen-die

1203
01:34:15,655 --> 01:34:18,692
♫ - In-kama-koray-ah-ma
- In-kama-koray-ah-ma

1204
01:34:18,825 --> 01:34:20,236
♫ - Hey
