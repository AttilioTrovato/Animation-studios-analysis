1
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:37,153
Ten and a half!
Nine fifty!

2
00:02:42,624 --> 00:02:44,524
Twenty-five!
I'll take it!

3
00:02:44,626 --> 00:02:50,360
How's July? July how?
July's at 95 and a quarter.

4
00:02:50,466 --> 00:02:52,400
Ninety-four and a half bid.
Hey, bonehead, moron!

5
00:02:52,534 --> 00:02:57,164
Moron? Moron this. At 95. At 95.
Keep your pencil to yourself!

6
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:00,504
94 and 3 quarter bid for 300.
Sold, 300!

7
00:03:00,609 --> 00:03:06,013
Buy 300, yes!
300, you idiot? Get out of my way.

8
00:03:09,618 --> 00:03:13,054
300 lots of coffee futures?
You call that a hunch?

9
00:03:13,188 --> 00:03:16,589
No, Richard. I call that an opportunity.

10
00:03:16,725 --> 00:03:20,252
300 lots in this market is not an opportunity. It's a death wish.

11
00:03:20,396 --> 00:03:23,559
Oh, ye of little faith.
o, no, no. Me of big mortgage.

12
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:27,533
Hi, Maddy. What've you got?
Flight 109 leaving J.F.K., 1:00 p.m.,

13
00:03:27,636 --> 00:03:29,695
arriving Caracas at 6:22 p.m.

14
00:03:29,805 --> 00:03:31,705
All right, all right.
Aw, come on.

15
00:03:31,807 --> 00:03:34,207
You're not still leaving, after what you did in there?

16
00:03:34,309 --> 00:03:38,712
I'm getting married to Charlotte.
I need the divorce from Patricia.

17
00:03:38,814 --> 00:03:40,714
Toiletries, shirts, socks..
I don't believe this.

18
00:03:40,816 --> 00:03:43,944
You're gonna leave me with 5,100 tons of coffee?

19
00:03:44,086 --> 00:03:48,887
Richard, I put up with you because you're the best analyst on the Street.

20
00:03:48,991 --> 00:03:50,549
You give me that same patronizing little speech...

21
00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:52,957
every time you play one of your stupid hunches.

22
00:03:53,095 --> 00:03:56,792
Yeah? And what happens?
I'm hospitalized, and the blood pressure medication is adjusted.

23
00:03:56,999 --> 00:04:01,561
Uplink. You'll overnight in Caracas, then fly to Canaima the next morning.

24
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:04,230
Thanks.
See ya in two days.

25
00:04:05,841 --> 00:04:08,639
Unbelievable.

26
00:04:22,691 --> 00:04:25,660
This thing might be quicker if you used both engines!

27
00:04:25,794 --> 00:04:29,252
Senor Kromwell?

28
00:04:29,364 --> 00:04:32,891
Senor Kromwell?

29
00:04:33,001 --> 00:04:35,629
That'd be me, Michael Cromwell, with a "C."

30
00:04:35,771 --> 00:04:39,935
Senor Cromwell with a "C." I am Abe Botero with a "B," your attorney-at-law.

31
00:04:40,042 --> 00:04:44,308
I am outrageously pleased to meet with you.

32
00:04:44,446 --> 00:04:46,641
Abe, Abe.
Let me go.

33
00:04:46,782 --> 00:04:49,649
My car is right over here.
Do you have any more luggage?

34
00:04:49,785 --> 00:04:53,744
I travel kinda light, Abe. So, what's the deal? Where is Patricia?

35
00:04:53,856 --> 00:04:57,417
Uh, we received this letter from your wife today.

36
00:04:57,526 --> 00:05:00,427
Senora Cromwell says that she could not come to Canaima,

37
00:05:00,529 --> 00:05:02,861
but she wants to get you to Lipo Lipo.
Wait a second.

38
00:05:02,998 --> 00:05:07,128
I travel 3,000 miles to get here. She doesn't show up? What's that about?

39
00:05:07,236 --> 00:05:09,966
Abe has a saying:

40
00:05:10,072 --> 00:05:12,768
He who knows what a woman wants, knows everything,

41
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:15,810
but not even God knows that.

42
00:05:15,911 --> 00:05:20,280
Okay. If that's the way she wants to play it, she's not gonna get a dime.

43
00:05:25,754 --> 00:05:31,124
If Cromwell should bother to call, put him through to my office!

44
00:05:31,226 --> 00:05:34,525
Has anybody seen that idiot Kempster around here?

45
00:05:34,663 --> 00:05:36,528
Kempster!

46
00:05:36,665 --> 00:05:39,156
Michael, you have got to get back here tomorrow.

47
00:05:39,268 --> 00:05:41,327
Langston is going insane.
Where are you?

48
00:05:41,436 --> 00:05:44,667
I'm staying in the middle of Nightmare on Bodega Street.

49
00:05:44,773 --> 00:05:48,174
If you don't get here, do I sell the coffee or do I hold it?

50
00:05:48,277 --> 00:05:51,838
No, no, no, no. Do not sell the coffee till I give you the go-ahead.

51
00:05:51,947 --> 00:05:54,347
Call me on the uplink as soon as London opens, all right?

52
00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:57,418
All right. Okay.
Kempster!

53
00:06:26,448 --> 00:06:28,882
Nah, I wouldn't do that.

54
00:06:28,984 --> 00:06:31,680
Oh, and why not?

55
00:06:31,787 --> 00:06:35,382
Oh!

56
00:07:02,918 --> 00:07:07,321
Lipo Lipo. So nice they named it twice.

57
00:07:09,491 --> 00:07:12,551
Oh, my God.

58
00:07:12,661 --> 00:07:14,754
She left me for Gilligan's Island!

59
00:07:20,135 --> 00:07:24,572
Great. I'll be right back.
Not long. I have an appointment.

60
00:07:24,673 --> 00:07:29,235
You have an appointment? Well, if it's the cable guy, you got plenty of time.

61
00:07:29,344 --> 00:07:30,470
Okay.
Hi, um..

62
00:07:31,647 --> 00:07:35,640
I'm.. I'm Michael Cromwell. I'm looking for Patricia Cromwell.

63
00:07:35,784 --> 00:07:38,776
You know Patricia Cromwell?

64
00:07:38,887 --> 00:07:41,287
She's a doctor.

65
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:45,520
No, a woman. Like me, but, but...

66
00:07:45,661 --> 00:07:47,526
full-figured.

67
00:07:47,663 --> 00:07:49,631
Paliku.

68
00:07:49,731 --> 00:07:51,961
Paliku.
Pali who?

69
00:07:52,067 --> 00:07:55,002
Paliku.
Paliku?

70
00:07:55,137 --> 00:07:58,538
Where is she?
Paliku.

71
00:07:58,674 --> 00:08:01,802
Paliku! Paliku!
Yes, I heard you. Okay, okay.

72
00:08:07,015 --> 00:08:08,880
Patricia.

73
00:08:09,017 --> 00:08:11,281
Mmm.

74
00:08:11,386 --> 00:08:13,650
You look different.

75
00:08:14,923 --> 00:08:17,619
Michael.
You made it.

76
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,489
Um, yes, I did.

77
00:08:21,897 --> 00:08:24,889
(Pinare)

78
00:08:30,939 --> 00:08:33,305
You look good.

79
00:08:33,408 --> 00:08:35,342
So do you.

80
00:08:35,444 --> 00:08:38,038
How've you been?
Better. Much better.

81
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,808
Weren't you supposed to meet me in Canaima last night?

82
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:43,180
Botako's having her first litter.

83
00:08:43,285 --> 00:08:45,913
Congratulations.
Not her.

84
00:08:46,054 --> 00:08:49,820
This is Pontspie. Pontspie,
(Pinare)

85
00:08:49,925 --> 00:08:51,825
Mmm.

86
00:08:53,595 --> 00:08:55,688
This is Botako.

87
00:08:55,797 --> 00:08:59,062
As much as I hate to spoil this joyous event,

88
00:08:59,201 --> 00:09:01,829
I took an airplane from New York City.
I have a boat waiting.

89
00:09:01,937 --> 00:09:04,428
You remember the divorce? Patricia?
(Pinare)

90
00:09:04,573 --> 00:09:07,201
Patricia!
Paliku.

91
00:09:07,309 --> 00:09:10,335
My Pinare name is Paliku.
We pick our own names here.

92
00:09:10,445 --> 00:09:14,882
Do you remember 12, 13 years ago, maybe, when out of the blue,

93
00:09:14,983 --> 00:09:18,441
we weren't even married a year, and you walked out on me.

94
00:09:18,587 --> 00:09:21,715
And now you want a divorce, and you think I'm gonna hit you up for money.

95
00:09:21,823 --> 00:09:24,291
We both want a divorce, and aren't you?

96
00:09:24,426 --> 00:09:29,056
I don't want any money.
Great! We can get to Caracas now.

97
00:09:29,164 --> 00:09:32,531
That way we can sign divorce papers.
I can be back in New York by Friday.

98
00:09:32,634 --> 00:09:36,035
Tomorrow is the Fanenteyou celebration.
I have to be here.

99
00:09:38,006 --> 00:09:39,906
Ooh.
It's a male!

100
00:09:40,008 --> 00:09:42,203
Ay!

101
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:45,143
As much as I'd like to stick around for the circumcision,

102
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,976
I've got a canoe waiting, and my boatman has an appointment.

103
00:09:48,116 --> 00:09:50,243
(Pinare)

104
00:09:51,586 --> 00:09:54,384
Your boatman is gone.
What?

105
00:09:54,489 --> 00:09:56,423
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Tell him to stop!

106
00:09:56,525 --> 00:10:01,724
Hasta la vista.
Hey, stop! You can't leave me here!

107
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:05,664
What you're doing is very unprofessional!

108
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:16,435
Oh, no.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

109
00:10:16,545 --> 00:10:19,275
Come back here!
Hey, hey, hey!

110
00:10:19,381 --> 00:10:22,782
I'm gonna need all these clothes back, right where they came from, all right?

111
00:10:22,884 --> 00:10:25,409
Aw, this is a Braun!

112
00:10:28,957 --> 00:10:32,188
What about my boat?
He'll be back. Couple of days.

113
00:10:32,327 --> 00:10:35,262
Wh.. What am I supposed to do now?

114
00:10:35,363 --> 00:10:37,797
The chief says you can spend the night with the bachelors.

115
00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:42,359
I'm not staying with the bachelors.
Or Pontspie offered her hut.

116
00:10:42,504 --> 00:10:45,132
Mm-mmm.

117
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,471
Bring on the bachelors.

118
00:10:52,147 --> 00:10:55,810
(Pinare)

119
00:11:02,023 --> 00:11:05,186
(Pinare)

120
00:11:05,327 --> 00:11:07,852
Come on, come on, come on.

121
00:11:07,996 --> 00:11:12,990
Hungry?
I am starving. Oh.

122
00:11:13,068 --> 00:11:16,037
It's yellow-eared bat, a Pinare specialty. It's made from the bladder.

123
00:11:16,171 --> 00:11:20,130
Oh, bat bladder.
Holy Kaopectate! I don't think so.

124
00:11:21,843 --> 00:11:25,074
You might prefer the kara toka.
Yeah, right.

125
00:11:25,213 --> 00:11:29,707
Chicken.
I would prefer that. Thanks. Ready.

126
00:11:30,018 --> 00:11:31,883
Excuse me.

127
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:35,717
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Michael, I have to talk to you.

128
00:11:35,857 --> 00:11:39,884
Patricia, let's not, okay?
There's something that you don't know.

129
00:11:40,028 --> 00:11:42,053
Yeah, like why you left me.

130
00:11:42,197 --> 00:11:47,499
Because of the fifth phone line.
What is that supposed to mean?

131
00:11:47,602 --> 00:11:51,561
One morning some guy showed up at our apartment to install a fifth phone line.

132
00:11:51,706 --> 00:11:54,072
He asked if I was the receptionist.

133
00:11:54,209 --> 00:11:56,336
And I realized that I had lost you somehow.

134
00:11:56,444 --> 00:12:00,380
I packed my things and I left you alone.
I figured you'd be happier that way.

135
00:12:00,482 --> 00:12:03,542
You thought this would make me happy?
How long before you noticed I was gone?

136
00:12:03,652 --> 00:12:05,552
Why didn't you talk to me?
Talk to you?

137
00:12:05,654 --> 00:12:07,554
I spent six months telling you I was unhappy.

138
00:12:07,656 --> 00:12:10,420
It was a crazy time for me.
I just started working at L.T.G.

139
00:12:10,558 --> 00:12:12,423
Michael.
I had a straddled position in sugar.

140
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,687
The price went up, it skyrocketed, I'm shorted..

141
00:12:14,796 --> 00:12:16,696
Michael. Michael!
What?

142
00:12:16,798 --> 00:12:19,266
It's very hard for me to tell you this, so please listen.

143
00:12:19,401 --> 00:12:22,598
What choice do I have? I'm stuck here with you and the Village People...

144
00:12:22,737 --> 00:12:25,228
till you celebrate Banana-fana-fo-fana.

145
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:29,436
Hello, you.
Ohhh.

146
00:12:29,577 --> 00:12:32,546
Excuse me.
The real world calls.

147
00:12:33,815 --> 00:12:36,113
Hello, you.

148
00:12:45,093 --> 00:12:47,618
What I'm trying to say is that..

149
00:12:47,762 --> 00:12:50,424
Look, I was right. I was right!
I wasn't exactly alone when I left you.

150
00:12:50,532 --> 00:12:53,558
97 and a quarter.
Michael. Michael.

151
00:12:53,668 --> 00:12:55,602
I'm with ya.
Coffee has gone crazy.

152
00:12:55,704 --> 00:12:58,639
I didn't know it, but I was...
97 and a quarter, 97, 97..

153
00:12:58,773 --> 00:13:02,140
I'm gonna wait till 97 and a half.
pregnant with your son.

154
00:13:02,277 --> 00:13:06,907
'Cause it's gonna happen. Waitin'. Papa is waitin'. Come to Papa, 97 and a half.

155
00:13:07,015 --> 00:13:12,612
Sold for a tidy $300,000 profit.
God, it's good to be good!

156
00:13:12,721 --> 00:13:15,986
What'd she say?
Hello, you.

157
00:13:16,124 --> 00:13:17,989
Patricia..

158
00:13:18,126 --> 00:13:22,028
All right, Patricia. What did I do?

159
00:13:22,163 --> 00:13:25,655
I just told you that you had a son, and you didn't even hear me.

160
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,099
What are you talking about? What son?
Your son.

161
00:13:29,204 --> 00:13:32,662
The boy sitting next to the fire over there is your son.

162
00:13:47,188 --> 00:13:49,679
That is my son?

163
00:13:54,162 --> 00:13:56,653
I must have started a thousand letters to tell you,

164
00:13:56,765 --> 00:13:59,529
but every one of them started with, "I know you never wanted children."

165
00:13:59,667 --> 00:14:01,828
This is nuts. This is nuts.
This is unbelievable.

166
00:14:01,936 --> 00:14:04,700
I was confused..
This is unforgivable!

167
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:08,366
I'm not asking you to forgive me, but he didn't do anything, so don't blame him.

168
00:14:25,693 --> 00:14:27,888
That's my son?

169
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:38,562
His name is Mimi Siku.

170
00:14:38,706 --> 00:14:41,903
His name is what?

171
00:14:42,043 --> 00:14:44,011
Mimi Siku.

172
00:14:44,112 --> 00:14:46,410
Mimi Siku.

173
00:14:46,548 --> 00:14:49,574
Roughly translated, it means...

174
00:14:49,717 --> 00:14:52,743
"Cat Piss."

175
00:14:52,887 --> 00:14:56,220
He picked the name "Cat Piss"?
He was six years old at the time.

176
00:14:56,324 --> 00:14:58,349
It's a territorial thing.

177
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,428
You sure he's mine?
Positive.

178
00:15:00,562 --> 00:15:04,191
He's got your nose, and he thinks he's never wrong.

179
00:15:04,265 --> 00:15:07,029
Hello, you.

180
00:15:07,135 --> 00:15:09,763
No, no, no! Get away!
No! Don't touch that!

181
00:15:09,904 --> 00:15:12,134
Don't touch that!
No, don't touch that!

182
00:15:12,273 --> 00:15:14,138
Huh?

183
00:15:17,412 --> 00:15:19,277
Oh.

184
00:15:21,649 --> 00:15:23,879
You wouldn't happen to have a place where I could stick that, would you?

185
00:15:23,985 --> 00:15:27,113
Hello, you.

186
00:15:40,335 --> 00:15:43,634
Talk about your wind instruments.

187
00:15:49,511 --> 00:15:52,173
Oh!

188
00:15:52,313 --> 00:15:55,248
Oh, ease up on the fruit, for God's sakes.

189
00:15:57,652 --> 00:15:59,643
Mitsubishi!

190
00:15:59,787 --> 00:16:01,755
Mimi Siku.

191
00:16:04,859 --> 00:16:09,159
Hi, uh, Mimi Siku.
I'm Michael Cromwell.

192
00:16:09,297 --> 00:16:13,859
Patricia.. Paliku tells me that, um,

193
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:18,200
that I'm your father.

194
00:16:19,874 --> 00:16:22,365
That's a nice pot you have.
(Pinare)

195
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:24,705
Do you understand any English ?

196
00:16:26,915 --> 00:16:32,353
Well, Patricia.. or Paliku.. wanted me to say something paternal to you.

197
00:16:32,487 --> 00:16:36,116
I gotta admit, this isn't easy for me.
I don't have any regrets.

198
00:16:36,224 --> 00:16:38,818
Well, I have regrets.

199
00:16:38,927 --> 00:16:41,327
But then again..
♪ Too few to mention ♪ Ha!

200
00:16:46,901 --> 00:16:48,801
(Pinare)

201
00:16:52,907 --> 00:16:57,901
(Pinare)

202
00:17:29,143 --> 00:17:32,909
Michael.

203
00:17:33,047 --> 00:17:37,040
You all right?
Yes. Put air bags in these things.

204
00:17:40,154 --> 00:17:43,521
What do you call this place again?
The Surface of the Sun?

205
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,684
Mimi said that you talked to him last night.

206
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,491
I told him that I was his father, and he said something in Indian,

207
00:17:49,597 --> 00:17:52,657
and then he gave a girl a pot.

208
00:17:52,767 --> 00:17:55,531
Giving a pot here is like giving flowers. It's a love gift.

209
00:17:56,804 --> 00:17:59,705
He's very popular with the girls.

210
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:03,766
Maybe he is mine after all.
He is yours.

211
00:18:03,911 --> 00:18:06,880
Why don't you try again? He's going out on the river. Go with him.

212
00:18:06,981 --> 00:18:08,881
Maybe I can teach him about commodities.

213
00:18:08,983 --> 00:18:11,918
Based on what I learned in the bachelor hut last night,

214
00:18:12,053 --> 00:18:14,180
he could make a killing in gas futures.

215
00:18:14,289 --> 00:18:17,224
Go.
Is it the local fruit?

216
00:18:35,343 --> 00:18:37,402
Baboon! Baboon!
Huh?

217
00:18:38,846 --> 00:18:41,406
No, no, no, no.
Monkey.

218
00:18:41,516 --> 00:18:44,076
Monkey.

219
00:18:44,218 --> 00:18:47,346
Toona. Toona.

220
00:18:47,488 --> 00:18:49,786
Oh.

221
00:18:49,891 --> 00:18:51,791
Parasite.

222
00:18:51,893 --> 00:18:55,522
No, uh, Mimi, um..
Water? Wa..

223
00:18:57,498 --> 00:18:59,363
Piranha.

224
00:19:01,235 --> 00:19:04,466
Cut, infection, death !

225
00:19:05,673 --> 00:19:08,699
Oh.

226
00:19:08,843 --> 00:19:10,640
Hoko. Hoko.

227
00:19:14,682 --> 00:19:17,207
Hoko.. bird.

228
00:19:17,352 --> 00:19:19,980
Bird who can't sing: Hoko Ono.

229
00:19:20,088 --> 00:19:23,148
No, no, no.
Hoko is toucan.

230
00:19:23,257 --> 00:19:25,054
Bird is pomoko.

231
00:19:27,862 --> 00:19:30,660
You speak English?
Paliku taught me.

232
00:19:30,765 --> 00:19:33,666
So, you understood everything I said last night.

233
00:19:42,043 --> 00:19:45,137
Is it much further?

234
00:19:45,246 --> 00:19:47,510
These shoes cost me $500. Whoa!

235
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:55,685
Hey, hey, hey!

236
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:58,850
Good shot!

237
00:20:02,263 --> 00:20:04,697
Buradu.

238
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,357
Okay.

239
00:20:07,969 --> 00:20:11,700
Scared of snake?
No, scared of snake bite.

240
00:20:13,074 --> 00:20:14,939
Ugh.

241
00:20:17,311 --> 00:20:19,108
Eww.

242
00:20:21,315 --> 00:20:24,751
This buradu is dead, right?
Sleeping. We kill it before we eat it.

243
00:20:24,886 --> 00:20:27,719
No, no, no, no.
I do not eat snake.

244
00:20:31,492 --> 00:20:36,725
Lizard guts.
Actually, the snake filled me right up.

245
00:20:36,831 --> 00:20:40,460
No. I make it for you. Tastes good.
Oh.

246
00:20:44,338 --> 00:20:47,899
Now you here, you stay with me all the time?

247
00:20:48,009 --> 00:20:50,409
I'd like to, Mimi Siku, but I can't.

248
00:20:50,511 --> 00:20:52,479
Why?

249
00:20:53,948 --> 00:20:57,645
I have a whole 'nother life where I live.

250
00:20:57,785 --> 00:20:59,650
Another son?

251
00:20:59,787 --> 00:21:02,813
No. You're the only son I have.

252
00:21:02,957 --> 00:21:06,085
I'll teach you to hunt.
Tomorrow I've got to go to my village.

253
00:21:06,194 --> 00:21:08,924
I'm a trader.
That's what I do, okay?

254
00:21:10,531 --> 00:21:12,931
This in your village, yes?

255
00:21:13,034 --> 00:21:15,264
Woman who hold fire up sky's butt?

256
00:21:17,939 --> 00:21:21,431
I've never had her described quite like that.

257
00:21:21,542 --> 00:21:23,601
Yes, she's in my village.

258
00:21:23,711 --> 00:21:26,145
We call her the Statue of Liberty.

259
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,772
When I'm a man, will you take me to Statue of Liberty ?

260
00:21:29,884 --> 00:21:31,784
Sure.
Why not ? Yeah.

261
00:21:31,886 --> 00:21:34,081
When you're a man, I'll take you to the Statue of Liberty.

262
00:21:34,188 --> 00:21:37,248
Wakatepe?
Wakatepe.

263
00:21:46,734 --> 00:21:48,964
Sleep time.

264
00:21:53,007 --> 00:21:54,872
Ugh.

265
00:22:18,933 --> 00:22:20,696
Mimi, don't move!

266
00:22:22,236 --> 00:22:24,227
Don't move! There's a giant spider on you!

267
00:22:26,407 --> 00:22:28,500
Don't move!
What's it doing?

268
00:22:28,609 --> 00:22:31,009
Oh, great!
It's now comin' after me!

269
00:22:31,112 --> 00:22:34,081
Damn, it's chasin' me.
Stop, stop, stop!

270
00:22:34,215 --> 00:22:37,514
I don't want to hurt you, but I will.

271
00:22:37,618 --> 00:22:40,348
I will crush you like... a bug!

272
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:44,524
Mimi, don't. No, no.
I can handle this.

273
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:47,185
Go to the village.
Save yourself!

274
00:23:01,943 --> 00:23:04,844
No, no, don't!
Back! Jesus!

275
00:23:20,428 --> 00:23:23,761
If you scream, Myteka attack.

276
00:23:23,898 --> 00:23:27,197
If you're calm, Myteka nice.

277
00:23:27,301 --> 00:23:31,067
But Kukuve always mean.
Who's Kukuve?

278
00:23:31,172 --> 00:23:33,231
Huh?

279
00:23:36,811 --> 00:23:40,076
This place is a nightmare!

280
00:23:40,748 --> 00:23:43,012
(Pinare)

281
00:23:44,151 --> 00:23:48,212
(Pinare)

282
00:23:50,124 --> 00:23:52,752
Baboon! Baboon!

283
00:23:57,031 --> 00:23:58,931
Nice turtle.

284
00:23:59,033 --> 00:24:00,830
Baboon! Baboon!

285
00:24:00,968 --> 00:24:03,937
The hair on your chest reminds them of a monkey.

286
00:24:04,038 --> 00:24:05,938
"Baboon" is your Pinare name.

287
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,406
Baboon? That's the best they could come up with?

288
00:24:08,509 --> 00:24:12,502
At first they wanted to go with "Man Who Must Be Smarter Than He Looks."

289
00:24:12,647 --> 00:24:15,275
If we get to pick our own names, I'd like to pick this:

290
00:24:15,383 --> 00:24:17,943
"Man Who's Extremely Well-Endowed."

291
00:24:18,052 --> 00:24:19,952
Sorry.
It's already taken.

292
00:24:20,054 --> 00:24:22,955
(Pinare)

293
00:24:28,863 --> 00:24:33,300
What's he sayin' to them?
The chief is telling the forest that Mimi's no longer a child.

294
00:24:40,841 --> 00:24:43,810
(Pinare)

295
00:24:55,256 --> 00:24:58,316
(Pinare)

296
00:25:01,929 --> 00:25:04,830
Are they finished?
Almost.

297
00:25:04,932 --> 00:25:08,129
But to become a tribal leader someday,

298
00:25:08,235 --> 00:25:11,500
Mimi has to perform a special task that the chief will give to him.

299
00:25:14,108 --> 00:25:16,508
He says he's very proud of Mimi Siku,

300
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:18,908
and, as his father, you should be too.

301
00:25:20,614 --> 00:25:23,174
Well, I am very proud of him, considering the fact...

302
00:25:23,284 --> 00:25:25,582
that I just found out a couple days ago I had a son,

303
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,587
and I'm standing about four feet from a witch doctor.

304
00:25:28,723 --> 00:25:31,351
(Pinare)

305
00:25:34,628 --> 00:25:37,188
(Pinare)

306
00:25:39,967 --> 00:25:44,700
Mimi has the task of bringing fire back from the Statue of Liberty.

307
00:25:44,805 --> 00:25:47,171
Guy doesn't kid around, does he?

308
00:25:47,274 --> 00:25:49,708
You promised to take me to New York when I become a man, Baboon.

309
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:53,712
And when you're a man, I will.
In this tribe, he is a man,

310
00:25:53,814 --> 00:25:57,215
and he wants to go now?

311
00:25:57,318 --> 00:26:01,186
No. Tomorrow we fly to Caracas, we sign the divorce papers.

312
00:26:01,288 --> 00:26:04,121
Then I get in a big, steel bird and fly back to New York City.

313
00:26:04,258 --> 00:26:08,217
Yakuza.
Did you promise to take him or not?

314
00:26:08,329 --> 00:26:12,390
Maybe. Mimi Siku, I have to be back on the exchange floor.

315
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,798
I'm gettin' married.
I cannot take you tomorrow.

316
00:26:14,935 --> 00:26:17,631
Here, if you make a promise, you keep it.

317
00:26:17,772 --> 00:26:21,538
"Tomorrow," "Can't," "Maybe."
These words don't mean anything to Mimi.

318
00:26:21,642 --> 00:26:24,975
You brought him down here to live with the Pirates of the Caribbean.

319
00:26:25,112 --> 00:26:26,579
Maybe you should have taught him better English.

320
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,649
This is the most important day in your son's life,

321
00:26:29,784 --> 00:26:31,877
and he wanted you here to share it with him,

322
00:26:31,986 --> 00:26:34,750
and now you're going to humiliate him in front of the whole tribe...

323
00:26:34,855 --> 00:26:37,483
by not keeping the first promise you ever made to him?

324
00:26:37,625 --> 00:26:41,652
Baboon, I.. I want to go.

325
00:26:41,796 --> 00:26:46,597
Mimi Siku, I am..
I'm very sorry.

326
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,328
You made wakatepe with me.

327
00:27:20,234 --> 00:27:22,964
Excuse me, Mr. Cromwell,

328
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:27,302
but the young man you're with is urinating on the exit door.

329
00:27:27,408 --> 00:27:29,808
Thank you.

330
00:27:37,585 --> 00:27:40,110
Me happy to be with you, Baboon.

331
00:27:44,725 --> 00:27:46,625
Michael!
Michael!

332
00:27:46,727 --> 00:27:49,525
All right, we gotta get movin' here pretty..

333
00:27:49,663 --> 00:27:53,565
Get on. It's just a moving sidewalk.

334
00:27:55,402 --> 00:27:57,393
Michael!
Hey, Mike!

335
00:27:57,538 --> 00:28:00,132
Michael, how ya doin'?
Richard, what are you doing here?

336
00:28:00,241 --> 00:28:02,675
I told Langston you had a reason.
You do have a reason, right?

337
00:28:02,776 --> 00:28:04,869
For what?
For holding on to the beans.

338
00:28:05,012 --> 00:28:08,072
What beans?
The coffee beans.

339
00:28:08,215 --> 00:28:10,240
You didn't sell them?
No.

340
00:28:10,384 --> 00:28:13,376
I told you to sell them at 97 and a half.

341
00:28:15,022 --> 00:28:17,183
Oh, God, I'm dead !

342
00:28:17,291 --> 00:28:20,852
I'm gonna lose my house!
Where will my children live?

343
00:28:20,961 --> 00:28:23,486
Richard.. Excuse me. Richard.

344
00:28:23,597 --> 00:28:26,566
Why didn't ya sell?

345
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:30,192
'Cause you didn't confirm, that's why!
What?

346
00:28:30,304 --> 00:28:33,000
You did not confirm.
What's coffee doin' now?

347
00:28:33,107 --> 00:28:36,201
It's under 90 cents and gone limit down.

348
00:28:38,145 --> 00:28:41,546
I asked you.. I told you to sell it at 97 and a half,

349
00:28:41,649 --> 00:28:43,617
and you can't do it 'cause I didn't say "confirm"?

350
00:28:43,751 --> 00:28:46,117
You're an idiot!
Look, for 15 years, Michael,

351
00:28:46,253 --> 00:28:48,187
you say "sell," I say "confirm."

352
00:28:48,289 --> 00:28:50,223
Sell, confirm.
Sell, confirm.

353
00:28:50,324 --> 00:28:53,953
You confirm, and I sell.
You didn't confirm, so I didn't sell.

354
00:28:54,094 --> 00:28:56,221
Look, kid, I've given to the rain forest, okay?

355
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:58,230
His name is Mimi Siku.

356
00:29:00,601 --> 00:29:03,536
He's my son.
What do you mean, "son"?

357
00:29:03,637 --> 00:29:06,299
You didn't have one when you left here three days ago.

358
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,568
Well, apparently I did.

359
00:29:09,677 --> 00:29:11,907
He's Patricia's son.

360
00:29:14,014 --> 00:29:17,211
He's Patricia and my son.

361
00:29:21,121 --> 00:29:25,057
This your village, Baboon?
Yep. This is my village.

362
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,060
It's big.

363
00:29:55,222 --> 00:29:57,588
Where are all the animals?

364
00:29:57,691 --> 00:30:01,024
Up in their offices, where they work.

365
00:30:01,161 --> 00:30:03,959
Cromwell!

366
00:30:04,064 --> 00:30:06,089
Okay.
Take a look at that.

367
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,260
Baboon must go fight the chief.

368
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:12,931
Look at this!
Cromwell, look at this.

369
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:17,443
Coffee is at 88, and it's dropping like a brick!

370
00:30:17,544 --> 00:30:20,980
By tomorrow morning, it could be 85 or lower.

371
00:30:21,081 --> 00:30:23,606
Just wait it out.
Something will happen.

372
00:30:23,717 --> 00:30:26,447
The market will turn around.
But what if it doesn't?

373
00:30:26,553 --> 00:30:28,180
You remember what happened in '91?

374
00:30:28,322 --> 00:30:30,552
You can't always depend on a natural disaster.

375
00:30:30,691 --> 00:30:33,717
It doesn't have to be a disaster.
We can hope for an assassination.

376
00:30:33,861 --> 00:30:35,726
Would you take it seriously for one minute?

377
00:30:35,863 --> 00:30:37,524
I'm trying to lighten this guy up.
Stop it. Stop it!

378
00:30:37,664 --> 00:30:39,655
Now, come on.
Behave yourselves here!

379
00:30:39,733 --> 00:30:44,966
Something better happen fast, or I'm gonna throw your butts out the window!

380
00:30:45,072 --> 00:30:48,473
What do you hotshots think about when you make these deals?

381
00:30:48,742 --> 00:30:51,643
You seem to have forgotten, Cromwell, that you...

382
00:30:51,745 --> 00:30:54,646
were investing the company's money.

383
00:30:54,748 --> 00:30:58,809
When you invest the company's money and win, the company's behind you.

384
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:04,482
But when you screw up like this, you're both on the hook for any loss we take.

385
00:31:04,591 --> 00:31:07,719
That would be over a million dollars.
That's not my problem.

386
00:31:07,861 --> 00:31:10,125
And by the way, Cromwell,

387
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:15,167
when somebody is playing with millions of dollars of my money,

388
00:31:15,269 --> 00:31:17,669
I generally like them in the country.

389
00:31:17,771 --> 00:31:20,296
This country!
Stop yelling, please.

390
00:31:20,407 --> 00:31:22,466
This is still my office.

391
00:31:22,576 --> 00:31:26,012
I'll shout, I'll yell, I'll scream as much as I want.

392
00:31:26,113 --> 00:31:28,138
When I made you shareholders in this company,

393
00:31:28,248 --> 00:31:31,012
it was to share profits, not losses!

394
00:31:31,118 --> 00:31:34,144
Not losses is right!
We're not here to share losses!

395
00:31:34,254 --> 00:31:38,020
We're here to share profits. Profits!

396
00:31:38,125 --> 00:31:41,754
Profits! Huh?

397
00:31:41,895 --> 00:31:46,696
Look up! It's an alien circle with Mickey Rourke's picture in it.

398
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,098
Look, look, look, look, look!

399
00:31:49,236 --> 00:31:51,830
Up, up! Look!
Look up! Look up!

400
00:31:51,939 --> 00:31:54,203
He just found out that he has a son.

401
00:31:54,308 --> 00:31:57,209
Look, look, look, look, look!

402
00:31:57,311 --> 00:32:00,371
Stop shouting, Baboon.
Myteka kill chief.

403
00:32:00,481 --> 00:32:03,211
Catch the damn spider, will you, please?

404
00:32:03,317 --> 00:32:08,050
Mm. I-I-I said I was gonna go fight the chief, not kill the chief.

405
00:32:08,155 --> 00:32:12,785
Around here, only... postal employees kill chief. Do you understand?

406
00:32:18,165 --> 00:32:22,568
Boy, whatever you do in Venezuela, do not try the chili del fuego.

407
00:32:30,978 --> 00:32:33,913
And I say we should just wait it out.

408
00:32:34,014 --> 00:32:36,414
You're insane. Langston is right.

409
00:32:36,517 --> 00:32:39,918
We have to find a buyer for the coffee, cut our losses and get out now.

410
00:32:42,156 --> 00:32:45,250
Wow! Nice shot!

411
00:32:49,029 --> 00:32:51,589
Put this away.

412
00:32:51,698 --> 00:32:54,098
Would you give me a few moments with Charlotte before you bring Mimi up?

413
00:32:54,201 --> 00:32:56,169
All right.

414
00:33:01,241 --> 00:33:04,642
Michael, you're back!
Where's Brian? Brian, let's go.

415
00:33:04,745 --> 00:33:07,714
Come on.
Come, come, come.

416
00:33:07,848 --> 00:33:11,511
Mmm.
I missed you. You never called me.

417
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,821
We're here, but we're not "here," okay?

418
00:33:15,923 --> 00:33:19,120
Try to think of us as, uh, furniture.

419
00:33:19,226 --> 00:33:21,990
Just act natural.
So, did you miss me, darling?

420
00:33:23,263 --> 00:33:25,823
I missed you very much.

421
00:33:25,933 --> 00:33:28,959
My pieces in the show were such a hit that Ian..

422
00:33:29,069 --> 00:33:31,333
Michael Cromwell, this is lan Finch-Chumley.

423
00:33:31,438 --> 00:33:33,338
Good to meet you, Ian.
Hi, Michael.

424
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,000
He's doing a profile on me for the Fashion Channel.

425
00:33:36,109 --> 00:33:38,236
He'll be following me from now through the spring collection,

426
00:33:38,378 --> 00:33:40,369
and he'll be covering the wedding as well.

427
00:33:40,514 --> 00:33:42,675
Isn't that fabulous?

428
00:33:42,783 --> 00:33:44,842
There's a Fashion Channel?

429
00:33:44,952 --> 00:33:47,716
Yeah.
Forget the camera.

430
00:33:47,854 --> 00:33:49,845
Just talk to me.
They're furniture.

431
00:33:49,957 --> 00:33:52,482
Now, honey, did you get everything settled ?

432
00:33:54,695 --> 00:33:57,858
Yeah.
Yes! Oh!

433
00:33:57,965 --> 00:34:02,527
Actually, um.. Actually, Patricia was very reasonable.

434
00:34:02,636 --> 00:34:07,699
So... what did you bring me?

435
00:34:07,808 --> 00:34:09,366
Ow!

436
00:34:09,476 --> 00:34:12,172
So, Mimi, how old are you ?

437
00:34:12,279 --> 00:34:16,045
The roots of the Yomano tree...

438
00:34:16,149 --> 00:34:19,084
have broken ground three times in my life.

439
00:34:19,219 --> 00:34:22,552
So, I guess that would make you around..

440
00:34:23,824 --> 00:34:26,190
Thirteen.
Thirteen. Thirteen.

441
00:34:27,828 --> 00:34:30,592
You know, I have a daughter around that age. Karen.

442
00:34:30,731 --> 00:34:33,063
Will I meet daughter?

443
00:34:33,166 --> 00:34:35,600
Yeah, yeah. She's just up at Charlotte's now.

444
00:34:35,736 --> 00:34:37,533
She's trying on her dress for the wedding.

445
00:34:38,905 --> 00:34:41,738
What are you doing?
Feed Myteka.

446
00:34:41,842 --> 00:34:43,742
What's Myteka?

447
00:34:50,684 --> 00:34:54,085
Are you upset?
You brought back a child.

448
00:34:54,187 --> 00:34:57,588
Everyone else I know comes back from South America with a bag of coffee.

449
00:34:57,691 --> 00:34:59,591
Well, I have ten million bags of coffee.

450
00:34:59,693 --> 00:35:01,957
I thought I'd bring back something with a little less caffeine.

451
00:35:02,095 --> 00:35:04,962
I have a show to prepare and a wedding to plan.

452
00:35:07,301 --> 00:35:10,293
That's months away. Honey?

453
00:35:12,205 --> 00:35:14,639
He's only gonna be here for a short while.

454
00:35:21,481 --> 00:35:23,415
Mimi.
Baboon.

455
00:35:23,517 --> 00:35:25,815
What have you done with Mr. Kempster?
Excuse me. Michael.

456
00:35:25,952 --> 00:35:28,443
Do you know who Myteka is?
Daddy!

457
00:35:31,558 --> 00:35:37,121
Karen. Look at you.
You look... beautiful.

458
00:35:38,231 --> 00:35:40,131
Angel on table.

459
00:35:44,071 --> 00:35:48,474
Look at me. I'm smoking.
The rain forest is a very hot issue.

460
00:35:48,575 --> 00:35:51,772
Being associated with this, uh, jungle bloke,

461
00:35:51,878 --> 00:35:53,641
it can only help you.

462
00:35:53,747 --> 00:35:56,614
Where's the rain forest?

463
00:35:56,717 --> 00:36:00,016
Brian, find out where the rain forest is.

464
00:36:00,153 --> 00:36:02,178
Right.

465
00:36:03,357 --> 00:36:05,985
Oh!

466
00:36:06,093 --> 00:36:08,960
Mimi Siku, this is Charlotte,

467
00:36:09,062 --> 00:36:12,293
and, uh, Charlotte, this is Mimi Siku.

468
00:36:12,399 --> 00:36:14,492
It's a pleasure to meet you, Mimi Siki.

469
00:36:14,601 --> 00:36:16,535
Mimi Siku.
Mimi Siku.

470
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:19,696
This your female, Baboon ?
This is my female.

471
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:23,003
And as his female, I'd like to invite you...

472
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:25,578
to dinner tonight with Fiona Gluckman.

473
00:36:25,712 --> 00:36:29,842
She's the fashion editor of Elle magazine.

474
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:34,319
Very major. She wants to see the sketches for my wedding trousseau.

475
00:36:34,421 --> 00:36:38,414
And if you're available, I'd love for you to join us.

476
00:36:38,558 --> 00:36:41,356
Is there anything special you like to eat?

477
00:36:41,461 --> 00:36:43,361
Lizard guts.

478
00:36:43,463 --> 00:36:45,761
Lizard guts?
Yes, but very lean.

479
00:36:47,234 --> 00:36:49,759
Great earrings. Honey!
Oh !

480
00:36:49,903 --> 00:36:51,837
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Mimi, Mimi, Mimi.

481
00:36:51,938 --> 00:36:53,906
Do you remember what we talked about, using the toilet on the airplane?

482
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,008
Let's continue to do that.

483
00:36:56,109 --> 00:36:59,101
I will find the men's room for him, and we will see you tonight.

484
00:37:00,247 --> 00:37:02,442
Come on, Mimi.

485
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:05,941
Will he be wearing the loin cloth to dinner?

486
00:37:06,086 --> 00:37:08,020
I'll get him some clothes.

487
00:37:09,322 --> 00:37:11,381
No, no, no, no.
Don't, don't, don't.

488
00:37:11,491 --> 00:37:15,086
Before you pee, you lift the seat. After you pee, you put the seat back down.

489
00:37:15,228 --> 00:37:18,391
Females in tribe start war over this.
Many deaths.

490
00:37:22,068 --> 00:37:24,593
Oh, that's very good.
Very..

491
00:37:24,738 --> 00:37:27,434
Bob Montgomery.
That's wonderful.

492
00:37:27,574 --> 00:37:30,702
Listen. So, Bob, I'm standing with Michael Cromwell,

493
00:37:30,811 --> 00:37:33,405
and, you know, considering our long history together,

494
00:37:33,513 --> 00:37:36,038
you're the first person we wanna make this offer to.

495
00:37:36,149 --> 00:37:40,483
Are you ready?
Fifty-one hundred tons of coffee beans.

496
00:37:44,658 --> 00:37:46,888
We're dead. Okay?
Baboon!

497
00:37:46,993 --> 00:37:49,427
Ah! He's doing a Fay Wray!
Baboon!

498
00:37:49,529 --> 00:37:52,225
Michael! Mumu!
Mimi!

499
00:37:52,332 --> 00:37:54,459
Come back inside!
Statue of Liberty, Baboon.

500
00:37:54,601 --> 00:37:57,092
You do as I tell you.
Get this!

501
00:37:57,204 --> 00:37:59,604
Come look!
No, no, no! Come back here!

502
00:37:59,706 --> 00:38:02,937
Mimi, Get back in here.
Cool.

503
00:38:03,043 --> 00:38:04,977
Life happens around you!
Move. Get outta my way.

504
00:38:05,111 --> 00:38:07,602
Come on. Mimi!
Watch out, watch out, watch out.

505
00:38:07,714 --> 00:38:09,614
Mimi! Mimi!
Get the wide-angle lens!

506
00:38:09,716 --> 00:38:11,650
Get out of the way, please!

507
00:38:14,855 --> 00:38:17,949
Mimi!
Wait, wait, wait!

508
00:38:29,069 --> 00:38:33,472
Statue of Liberty, Baboon.
Statue not far, Baboon.

509
00:38:33,573 --> 00:38:36,098
Mimi, you stand right there.

510
00:38:36,209 --> 00:38:39,269
We go now?
We'll go tomorrow, okay?

511
00:38:42,649 --> 00:38:45,140
Whoa. Ahhh.

512
00:38:45,252 --> 00:38:47,345
People down there so far from us.

513
00:38:47,487 --> 00:38:50,320
I'd like to keep 'em that way, okay?

514
00:38:50,423 --> 00:38:52,516
I'm gonna die up here.

515
00:38:52,659 --> 00:38:55,184
Nothing bad happened, Baboon.

516
00:38:55,328 --> 00:38:58,126
I just hate heights.

517
00:38:58,231 --> 00:38:59,960
Whoa.

518
00:39:00,066 --> 00:39:02,125
Oh.

519
00:39:02,235 --> 00:39:04,499
Pinare secret: Don't look down.

520
00:39:04,604 --> 00:39:07,801
Just for the record, it's not that big a secret.

521
00:39:11,678 --> 00:39:13,805
Yeah!

522
00:39:13,914 --> 00:39:17,008
Don't you ever, ever, ever do that to me again!

523
00:39:17,117 --> 00:39:20,553
When I tell you to do something, I mean it. Do you understand me?

524
00:39:20,687 --> 00:39:22,314
Mimi Siku sorry.

525
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:25,590
Come on. Come on. Come on.

526
00:39:28,128 --> 00:39:29,720
Mm, sorry.

527
00:39:31,765 --> 00:39:34,359
I was just worried about you out there.
I really was. All right?

528
00:39:34,467 --> 00:39:36,492
Well, um, we should go.

529
00:39:41,908 --> 00:39:45,344
Baboon scared?
Yes, Baboon scared.

530
00:39:45,445 --> 00:39:47,606
Baboon not know he could be so scared.

531
00:39:47,747 --> 00:39:49,612
Baboon's pants a little damp.

532
00:39:54,387 --> 00:39:59,222
Charlie, this is fabulous!
Mimi, get down.

533
00:39:59,326 --> 00:40:03,228
When I saw the shoulders on this gown, I plotzed.

534
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:06,299
I said to myself, "Fiona,

535
00:40:06,433 --> 00:40:08,731
this.. this is the future of fashion."

536
00:40:08,835 --> 00:40:11,269
Oh, no. Remember what I told ya?

537
00:40:11,404 --> 00:40:13,372
Forks go on the left side.
This side.

538
00:40:13,473 --> 00:40:16,636
Small fork on the outside. Take your knife, put it over next to the spoon.

539
00:40:16,776 --> 00:40:19,267
The blade.. The blade in.
Perfect.

540
00:40:19,412 --> 00:40:21,880
Yeah. Might wanna work on that one too.

541
00:40:21,982 --> 00:40:23,882
In Lipo Lipo, we eat with hands.

542
00:40:23,984 --> 00:40:26,418
In New York, New York, we eat with forks.

543
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:29,044
When are we gonna eat?
I'm famished!

544
00:40:29,155 --> 00:40:31,623
A little champagne?

545
00:40:31,758 --> 00:40:33,919
Gino, why don't you show her the bridesmaids sketches?

546
00:40:34,027 --> 00:40:36,052
Show me, show me, show me, show me.

547
00:40:39,032 --> 00:40:41,762
Oh, I'm loving this!

548
00:40:42,869 --> 00:40:44,268
Ah!

549
00:40:44,371 --> 00:40:47,101
What is taking so long with the food?

550
00:40:47,207 --> 00:40:49,107
I'll give them a call.

551
00:40:51,044 --> 00:40:56,778
I don't eat meat, I don't eat dairy or nightshade vegetables,

552
00:40:56,883 --> 00:40:59,613
and, of course, I don't touch preservatives.

553
00:40:59,719 --> 00:41:02,483
Obviously.

554
00:41:02,622 --> 00:41:05,182
Cat fat.
Mm-hmm.

555
00:41:05,325 --> 00:41:09,125
We eat cat.
Excuse me?

556
00:41:09,229 --> 00:41:11,493
That must be the food.

557
00:41:11,631 --> 00:41:14,122
Oh! Finally.
Gino, Louis.

558
00:41:14,234 --> 00:41:16,134
Coming.

559
00:41:16,236 --> 00:41:18,295
We are not going to eat the cat.

560
00:41:24,411 --> 00:41:27,471
Cat's job, feed people.
No, not here.

561
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:31,539
Here, cat's job is to sleep and lick crotch.

562
00:41:31,685 --> 00:41:36,384
Oh, Charlie, it smells so good! I can't stand it!

563
00:41:36,523 --> 00:41:38,718
Of course, this is much too much for me.

564
00:41:38,858 --> 00:41:40,849
Did they forget my tiramisu?

565
00:41:44,764 --> 00:41:47,324
Oh, God!
This much tasty.

566
00:41:47,434 --> 00:41:49,868
Your female makes good food, Baboon.

567
00:41:50,003 --> 00:41:51,994
Oh!

568
00:41:52,105 --> 00:41:54,198
Oh, Louis, you are such a cliche.

569
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:10,383
You had no right to change the rules.
What rules?

570
00:42:10,523 --> 00:42:12,491
When we talked about having children,

571
00:42:12,592 --> 00:42:15,527
we agreed that you would be my child and that I would be your child,

572
00:42:15,628 --> 00:42:18,654
and now I find out that you've had a child all along.

573
00:42:18,765 --> 00:42:21,666
Wait a second. Are you saying that I knew that I had a child?

574
00:42:21,768 --> 00:42:24,669
Well, if I had a child, I certainly would have known.

575
00:42:24,771 --> 00:42:28,207
Hello! You're a woman. Of course you'd know.
You're there when you have it!

576
00:42:28,308 --> 00:42:33,211
There's no magical bond between a father and son that spans the continents.

577
00:42:33,313 --> 00:42:36,544
The only reason I know I have a child is because you insisted..

578
00:42:36,649 --> 00:42:39,846
So now you're saying that you having a child is my fault?

579
00:42:39,953 --> 00:42:42,012
I don't think so, Michael.
Mimi's just visiting.

580
00:42:42,122 --> 00:42:44,352
I wanna show him a good time.

581
00:42:44,457 --> 00:42:48,951
After that, he goes back home, and we can go back to being the way we were..

582
00:42:49,095 --> 00:42:52,223
entirely wrapped up in ourselves.

583
00:42:52,332 --> 00:42:54,425
Promise?

584
00:43:47,787 --> 00:43:49,618
Ow!

585
00:44:41,074 --> 00:44:44,202
My little darlings.

586
00:44:46,846 --> 00:44:52,045
Ah. Ooh. Are your little bellies empty?

587
00:44:52,185 --> 00:44:54,176
Oh.

588
00:44:54,287 --> 00:44:55,845
Bonjour.

589
00:44:57,257 --> 00:45:00,055
Ah. Bonjour.

590
00:45:00,193 --> 00:45:03,822
We are all so happy today, n'est-ce pas?

591
00:45:06,299 --> 00:45:08,324
What's goin' on up here?

592
00:45:08,434 --> 00:45:11,733
Did you.. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

593
00:45:11,871 --> 00:45:14,567
Go! Go!

594
00:45:14,707 --> 00:45:17,835
Mimi, you can't do this. You do not kill birds around here for breakfast.

595
00:45:17,944 --> 00:45:21,380
If you're hungry, ask me.
I bought some stuff for ya.

596
00:45:21,481 --> 00:45:24,041
This is what kids love.
Cap'n Crunch.

597
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:26,345
What is?

598
00:45:26,452 --> 00:45:31,890
This is cereal. It's just corn, brown sugar, yellow #5 and zinc oxide?

599
00:45:31,991 --> 00:45:34,960
They've added a sunblock to it.

600
00:45:35,094 --> 00:45:39,258
You pour this on this, and that's your breakfast. Enjoy yourself.

601
00:45:41,668 --> 00:45:46,037
Charlie. Come on.
Wake up, sweetheart.

602
00:45:46,139 --> 00:45:50,200
Wake up. Charlie.
Bloomingdale's burned down.

603
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:52,574
What?

604
00:45:52,679 --> 00:45:54,738
Mimi's having breakfast out in the kitchen.

605
00:45:54,847 --> 00:45:57,077
I will be home before lunch.

606
00:45:57,183 --> 00:45:59,583
Bye.
Wait.

607
00:45:59,686 --> 00:46:03,952
I can't watch him.
Women's Wear is coming to the loft.

608
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:06,718
You don't need to baby-sit him.
He'll be fine.

609
00:46:06,826 --> 00:46:08,726
Now go back to sleep.

610
00:46:13,299 --> 00:46:16,063
Mmm.

611
00:46:16,169 --> 00:46:19,661
Mimi, I gotta get goin' here.
No. No!

612
00:46:19,806 --> 00:46:21,774
This isn't.. No.
No, it's not your fault.

613
00:46:21,874 --> 00:46:25,469
I didn't mention that you usually put this in a bowl.

614
00:46:25,611 --> 00:46:27,476
When we go to Statue of Liberty ?

615
00:46:27,613 --> 00:46:29,945
Uh, tomorrow.
Tomorrow?

616
00:46:30,049 --> 00:46:33,143
I know I told you we were going today, but I can't today.

617
00:46:33,286 --> 00:46:36,153
I-I.. The Baboon's makin' some very big trades today.

618
00:46:36,289 --> 00:46:38,621
Me go trade with Baboon.
Baboon go alone.

619
00:46:38,725 --> 00:46:42,923
I'd like to be around you, but, but I'm obligated to go.

620
00:46:44,297 --> 00:46:45,764
What means "obligated"?

621
00:46:45,865 --> 00:46:48,129
Obligated.
It means...

622
00:46:49,836 --> 00:46:52,964
when you do something that you don't really wanna do.

623
00:46:53,072 --> 00:46:54,972
Okay.

624
00:46:57,243 --> 00:47:00,770
Baboon obligated.
And will you promise Baboon one thing?

625
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,440
You won't shoot any more animals?

626
00:47:06,219 --> 00:47:08,187
And don't eat the cat.

627
00:47:08,321 --> 00:47:10,949
I'll bring food home.

628
00:47:31,110 --> 00:47:33,135
(Pinare)

629
00:47:40,253 --> 00:47:43,154
Myteka?
Myteka?

630
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:46,190
Myteka?

631
00:47:47,293 --> 00:47:49,352
Myteka?

632
00:47:50,897 --> 00:47:52,831
Myteka?

633
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:56,693
Myteka?

634
00:47:57,937 --> 00:47:59,837
Myteka.

635
00:48:01,607 --> 00:48:03,507
Myteka.

636
00:48:08,781 --> 00:48:10,681
Myteka?

637
00:48:19,125 --> 00:48:21,719
Nice pushibushi.

638
00:48:21,828 --> 00:48:25,889
That is the last pushibushi you're gonna see around here, you little savage!

639
00:48:35,675 --> 00:48:37,734
Hi, we're not here right now. Leave a message.

640
00:48:37,844 --> 00:48:40,278
We'll call you right back.

641
00:48:40,413 --> 00:48:42,438
Charlie. Pick up. It's me.

642
00:48:44,350 --> 00:48:46,910
You're probably in the bathroom, making yourself look beautiful.

643
00:48:47,019 --> 00:48:49,749
Um, I don't want you feelin' trapped by Mimi.

644
00:48:49,856 --> 00:48:54,452
Try to open up to him.
Just don't leave him alone with the cat.

645
00:48:54,594 --> 00:48:56,494
I'll see you soon.
I love you. Bye.

646
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,764
Michael, don't hang up!
Don't hang up! There's a spider!

I should take some pictures of Mimi.

687

You can never have enough pictures of your kids.

688
00:51:52,935 --> 00:51:55,961
We have, like, 400 albums.

689
00:51:56,104 --> 00:51:58,971
I've never looked at them, but they exist. It's good.

690
00:51:59,107 --> 00:52:01,632
Come on. Let's go.

691
00:52:01,777 --> 00:52:04,473
Michael, you have a call.

692
00:52:04,613 --> 00:52:08,481
I told you to hold all calls.
Richard, it's the police.

693
00:52:08,817 --> 00:52:10,409
What?

694
00:52:11,019 --> 00:52:13,988
On top of everything else, didn't I tell you to wait in the apartment..

695
00:52:14,289 --> 00:52:16,257
I want to see Statue of Liberty.

696
00:52:16,358 --> 00:52:20,385
I said we'd do that tomorrow.
You too busy for Mimi Siku!

697
00:52:20,495 --> 00:52:22,725
I want to see Statue to Liberty, I go.

698
00:52:22,831 --> 00:52:26,130
I've got a life here. I can't change everything just because you showed up.

699
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:31,638
Then why you bring me here?
I was obligated.

700
00:52:34,710 --> 00:52:38,942
You obligated be with me?

701
00:52:42,317 --> 00:52:46,651
Mimi. Mimi? Mimi!

702
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:49,518
Mimi, come here! Stop!

703
00:52:49,658 --> 00:52:55,358
Come back here! Whoop!
Mimi, I didn't mean that!

704
00:52:55,497 --> 00:52:57,124
You said "obligated"!

705
00:52:57,232 --> 00:52:59,700
I didn't mean that.
Now, stop! Look out!

706
00:52:59,835 --> 00:53:03,532
Mimi, come on!

707
00:53:03,672 --> 00:53:07,039
Get out of the street! Come on!
Get out of the street!

708
00:53:07,175 --> 00:53:10,667
I want to go home.
You not want Mimi Siku here!

709
00:53:10,812 --> 00:53:12,712
I want you here.
I'm sorry.

710
00:53:12,848 --> 00:53:16,682
Look, stop, stop.
Look.

711
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:18,877
Sorry I said that stuff.
I was just angry.

712
00:53:19,021 --> 00:53:21,819
You always angry at me.
"Don't do this! Don't do that!"

713
00:53:21,923 --> 00:53:24,551
This is New York.
This is a dangerous jungle.

714
00:53:24,693 --> 00:53:28,561
Mimi Siku not scared. Mimi Siku a man.
No, you're not a man.

715
00:53:28,697 --> 00:53:30,562
You are an adolescent.

716
00:53:30,699 --> 00:53:33,896
Adolescent?
Yes. An adolescent.

717
00:53:34,036 --> 00:53:38,700
You don't have a wife.
You don't have a family to support.

718
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,831
You are free to do whatever you want.

719
00:53:40,942 --> 00:53:43,809
You're an adolescent.

720
00:53:43,912 --> 00:53:47,507
What? No, no, no, no!

721
00:53:47,616 --> 00:53:49,743
I am not an adolescent.
I'm a man.

722
00:53:49,885 --> 00:53:52,479
I'm a man too.
Not here you're not a man.

723
00:53:52,587 --> 00:53:55,249
You're a 13-year-old boy running around in a loin cloth.

724
00:53:55,390 --> 00:53:57,688
I'm a man too!

725
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:10,403
Okay, okay. You're right.
You are a man.

726
00:54:10,539 --> 00:54:13,269
But you're gonna have to learn what men do in my jungle.

727
00:54:13,408 --> 00:54:16,605
And you have to learn how to breathe when you run.

728
00:54:19,081 --> 00:54:21,276
Okay, first lesson.
Ooh!

729
00:54:21,416 --> 00:54:23,782
You wanna go some place in my village,

730
00:54:23,919 --> 00:54:27,184
all you gotta do is wave your arm.

731
00:54:27,289 --> 00:54:29,189
Wave your arm.

732
00:54:33,562 --> 00:54:37,794
Magic.
Magic if he understands English.

733
00:54:37,933 --> 00:54:42,233
Fulton Fish Market on "ze" double.
Okay. (Foreign Language)

734
00:54:42,337 --> 00:54:45,101
W-Where is he?

735
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,868
Richard, this guy gets very upset when you're late.

736
00:54:47,976 --> 00:54:51,275
Yes, well, he's gonna be here.
He's obviously delayed..

737
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:53,278
Here he is! Okay.

738
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:56,976
Get your stuff. Get out the other side.
Thank you very much.

739
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:59,280
You call this a tip?
Mimi, watch traffic when you're comin' around.

740
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:03,551
What took you..
We're meeting this guy at a fish stall?

741
00:55:03,658 --> 00:55:06,650
No, he is above a fish stall.

742
00:55:06,795 --> 00:55:08,990
Much better.

743
00:55:11,133 --> 00:55:14,466
Ooh!
I love what they've done with the place.

744
00:55:14,603 --> 00:55:17,572
Let me tell you something.
This guy has a lot of money.

745
00:55:17,672 --> 00:55:20,163
He's the king of caviar, and he's gonna save our asses.

746
00:55:20,308 --> 00:55:22,606
So you just play your hunches and let me play mine.

747
00:55:22,711 --> 00:55:25,612
Okay, okay. Now, listen up.

748
00:55:25,714 --> 00:55:29,172
When you get to the top of the stairs, ring the bell once,

749
00:55:29,317 --> 00:55:33,515
knock twice, then ring three times.

750
00:55:33,655 --> 00:55:35,520
Okay.

751
00:55:35,657 --> 00:55:38,751
Don't forget.

752
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:41,260
What happened to his fingers?

753
00:55:41,363 --> 00:55:45,629
He rang four times.
Good luck.

754
00:55:48,336 --> 00:55:50,964
Ring twice, knock once, ring three times, okay.

755
00:55:51,072 --> 00:55:53,370
Oh, boy.
Okay, um, okay.

756
00:55:53,508 --> 00:55:55,373
So it is..
What? What?

757
00:55:55,510 --> 00:55:57,671
Ring twice.
Ring twice.

758
00:55:57,812 --> 00:56:00,440
Knock once and then ring three times.
You sure it's three?

759
00:56:00,549 --> 00:56:02,949
Yes, it's definitely three times.

760
00:56:03,051 --> 00:56:06,316
Okay.

761
00:56:07,422 --> 00:56:09,549
Okay, that's wrong.

762
00:56:09,691 --> 00:56:12,387
So what we do.. Ring three times.
I'm not sure..

763
00:56:12,527 --> 00:56:15,826
Knock once and ring twice.
No, it..

764
00:56:15,931 --> 00:56:18,729
Yeah, yeah.
We're gonna get shot.

765
00:56:18,867 --> 00:56:20,835
Uh-uh. lt's gonna be fine.
It's gonna be good.

766
00:56:20,936 --> 00:56:24,167
That really worked great. I remember differently now. I got what it is.

767
00:56:24,272 --> 00:56:26,172
All right, Mr. Wizard. Take over.
Ring twice.

768
00:56:26,274 --> 00:56:28,367
Take over.
You knock once.

769
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:31,536
And ring..
No! You do not ring 4 times.

770
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:34,148
Open damn door!

771
00:56:34,249 --> 00:56:36,479
Chort vozmi!

772
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:45,022
Hi there. I am, uh..
Hi.

773
00:56:45,126 --> 00:56:47,151
Don't say a word.
I know, I know.

774
00:56:47,262 --> 00:56:49,662
Let me introduce my comrades to you.

775
00:56:49,764 --> 00:56:52,927
Stand up.
Thank you. Sit down.

776
00:56:53,068 --> 00:56:55,593
Come! We talk beans.

777
00:56:55,737 --> 00:56:58,501
Sit, sit.

778
00:56:58,607 --> 00:57:02,771
Coffee on market now 83 cents one pound.

779
00:57:02,911 --> 00:57:07,712
I pay you 85 cents one pound.

780
00:57:07,816 --> 00:57:10,842
Why you take trade?
Shh! Uh, Michael.

781
00:57:10,952 --> 00:57:14,285
85 cents more than 83 cents?
Yes, it is.

782
00:57:14,422 --> 00:57:17,289
Tell wild child to shut up!
Hey!

783
00:57:17,425 --> 00:57:21,521
He's just a kid.
Listen, he's an unusual kid.

784
00:57:21,630 --> 00:57:26,624
Not now, Mama.
So we have a deal then?

785
00:57:26,768 --> 00:57:30,636
I want guarantee the price not drop below 75.

786
00:57:30,772 --> 00:57:32,637
You got it.
Wait a minute!

787
00:57:32,774 --> 00:57:36,073
There are no guarantees.
This is speculation.

788
00:57:36,177 --> 00:57:39,146
I know speculation.

789
00:57:39,281 --> 00:57:43,149
He knows speculation, for heaven's sake.
When can we expect payment?

790
00:57:44,786 --> 00:57:46,253
This is lovely.

791
00:57:49,457 --> 00:57:52,824
Look, Richard, it's cash.

792
00:57:52,961 --> 00:57:54,986
Oh, my.

793
00:57:55,130 --> 00:57:57,826
Take!

794
00:57:57,966 --> 00:58:01,265
Look, um, would it be possible to talk to my partner in private?

795
00:58:01,369 --> 00:58:02,495
Of course.

796
00:58:02,637 --> 00:58:06,232
Richard, let's go.
Ooh!

797
00:58:06,341 --> 00:58:08,502
It'll just take a moment.

798
00:58:14,649 --> 00:58:17,117
Richard, are you out of your mind?

799
00:58:17,218 --> 00:58:19,618
Now we're laundering money for the Russian Mafia?

800
00:58:19,721 --> 00:58:22,622
Yes, we are.
And we'll iron it for them too.

801
00:58:22,724 --> 00:58:26,182
Him Big Buradu.
Yes, he is.

802
00:58:26,328 --> 00:58:27,693
Come on, Mimi.
Let's go.

803
00:58:27,829 --> 00:58:31,128
You cannot walk away on this, please.
No deal.

804
00:58:31,232 --> 00:58:34,326
Think about this for one second!
Just get us out of this.

805
00:58:36,004 --> 00:58:38,199
All right. Oh!
Problem?

806
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:42,299
Oh, no. No, no.
Not at all. Uh..

807
00:58:42,410 --> 00:58:44,708
Mr. Cromwell had to take his son home.

808
00:58:44,846 --> 00:58:47,280
But he thinks you're a stand-up guy, Mr. J.

809
00:58:47,382 --> 00:58:51,045
He feels that..
My name is...

810
00:58:51,186 --> 00:58:55,623
Alex Vasili Sergei Fyodor Jovanovic.

811
00:58:55,724 --> 00:58:58,454
Not Mr. J.

812
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:00,551
It's a good name.

813
00:59:00,695 --> 00:59:02,560
We have deal?

814
00:59:02,697 --> 00:59:05,825
We have deal?

815
00:59:05,934 --> 00:59:08,402
We have deal?

816
00:59:13,208 --> 00:59:15,073
Mmm.

Thanks, buddy.

01:01:25,306 --> 01:01:29,470
Huh? Here. Why don't you give her the flowers?

850
01:01:29,577 --> 01:01:32,375
Charlie, how'd that interview go?

851
01:01:32,514 --> 01:01:35,278
You home, Charlie?
Michael, I'm in here!

852
01:01:35,383 --> 01:01:39,945
Charlie?
I've been in this bathroom for hours!

853
01:01:40,054 --> 01:01:42,147
Make sure you open a window.
Michael!

854
01:01:42,257 --> 01:01:45,192
Michael, I'm being attacked by a giant spider!

855
01:01:45,326 --> 01:01:48,727
Oh! I can see it!
Move away from the door!

856
01:01:48,863 --> 01:01:50,558
Move away from the door!

857
01:01:50,698 --> 01:01:52,962
Grab this thing. Come on. Come on.
Do something!

858
01:01:53,067 --> 01:01:55,228
I'm doing something. I'm gonna fight it.
Stay away from the door!

859
01:01:55,370 --> 01:01:57,668
Look at that.
Oh, it's a big one! It's a big one!

860
01:01:57,772 --> 01:02:00,172
Be careful!
I'm gonna put it in the wastebasket.

861
01:02:00,275 --> 01:02:03,574
Don't come out here yet.
It's still moving.

862
01:02:03,711 --> 01:02:05,576
Put the thing back in its box.
What?

863
01:02:05,713 --> 01:02:07,578
It's as big as an ox!

864
01:02:07,715 --> 01:02:13,415
You bad girl, Myteka.
Stay here.

865
01:02:16,724 --> 01:02:18,589
To him it's like a pet.

866
01:02:18,726 --> 01:02:22,321
No, no, no. A dog is a pet, Michael.
A cat is a pet!

867
01:02:22,430 --> 01:02:26,764
Although for your son, a cat
is a dietary supplement as well.

868
01:02:26,901 --> 01:02:28,926
We'll just keep him out on the balcony.

869
01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:31,163
How do you know it hasn't already laid eggs in the apartment?

870
01:02:31,272 --> 01:02:32,671
I'll have the place fumigated.

871
01:02:32,774 --> 01:02:36,005
What if they miss one and it crawls into my ear...

872
01:02:36,110 --> 01:02:38,510
while I'm sleeping and lays its eggs in my brain?

873
01:02:38,613 --> 01:02:41,173
We'll have to have them come back and spray again.

874
01:02:41,282 --> 01:02:44,046
This is serious! We have to move!

875
01:02:44,152 --> 01:02:47,519
You're blowing this out of proportion.
Oh!

876
01:02:49,791 --> 01:02:52,555
Ian. Great.
I've really missed you.

877
01:02:52,660 --> 01:02:54,560
Is Charlotte all right?

878
01:02:54,662 --> 01:02:58,359
Look, if something dramatic has happened, it should be on film.

879
01:02:58,466 --> 01:03:02,197
I have a shoot tomorrow which I was unable to prepare for...

880
01:03:02,303 --> 01:03:06,637
because I was trapped in the bathroom all day by his son's pet spider.

881
01:03:06,774 --> 01:03:10,266
So I'll be spending the night at the loft to make up for lost time.

882
01:03:10,411 --> 01:03:14,142
So the appearance of little Mowgli is straining the relationship?

883
01:03:14,282 --> 01:03:16,477
Ian, you're furniture, and furniture doesn't talk.

884
01:03:16,618 --> 01:03:19,485
Furniture may not talk, Michael, but it listens,

885
01:03:19,621 --> 01:03:21,486
better than you do.

886
01:03:21,623 --> 01:03:24,786
I'm an artist, Michael. You look at something and see what it is.

887
01:03:24,926 --> 01:03:27,451
I look at something and see what it can be...

888
01:03:27,595 --> 01:03:29,722
and who can wear it.

889
01:03:29,831 --> 01:03:33,665
Charlotte.

890
01:03:35,803 --> 01:03:38,829
You all right?

891
01:03:40,308 --> 01:03:43,243
Charlotte's mad.

892
01:03:43,344 --> 01:03:46,006
She doesn't like me.
No, no, no, no.

893
01:03:46,147 --> 01:03:48,342
Come on.
It's not you at all. It's me.

894
01:03:48,483 --> 01:03:50,508
She's afraid of change.

895
01:03:50,652 --> 01:03:53,849
Why did Paliku leave you, Baboon?

896
01:03:53,988 --> 01:03:58,857
Boy, um..

897
01:04:01,029 --> 01:04:03,691
I probably took her for granted.

898
01:04:03,831 --> 01:04:06,197
So now you're with Charlotte?

899
01:04:06,334 --> 01:04:09,701
Yes, I am.

900
01:04:09,837 --> 01:04:12,032
Many females in your village, Baboon.

901
01:04:12,173 --> 01:04:13,538
Mm-hmm.

902
01:04:13,675 --> 01:04:16,143
Why you pick only one?

903
01:04:17,845 --> 01:04:21,474
Well, when you pick one to love, it's very different.

904
01:04:23,685 --> 01:04:28,622
It's like there's a big picture of her in front of your face at all times.

905
01:04:28,723 --> 01:04:32,887
And the picture's so big you can't see any other females.

906
01:04:33,027 --> 01:04:38,488
Well, I try harder to make Charlotte like me.

907
01:04:48,910 --> 01:04:52,573
Hi!
Hello, Jan. You look nice today.

908
01:04:52,714 --> 01:04:54,909
Thank you.

909
01:04:55,049 --> 01:04:58,678
This... is Mimi Siku.

910
01:04:58,786 --> 01:05:03,155
Mimi, this is Mrs. Kempster.
I think you know Karen.

911
01:05:03,257 --> 01:05:06,488
Isn't he adorable?
Mom!

912
01:05:06,594 --> 01:05:09,324
Hello, Mimi Siku!
Jan.

913
01:05:09,430 --> 01:05:12,092
I am so happy that you've come to our house...

914
01:05:12,233 --> 01:05:14,861
Jan.
in the country to spend the night!

915
01:05:14,969 --> 01:05:18,268
He's not deaf.
Although he might be now.

916
01:05:18,406 --> 01:05:21,000
I can't thank you enough for letting him spend the night.

917
01:05:21,109 --> 01:05:22,906
I've really got to spend some time with Charlotte.

918
01:05:23,044 --> 01:05:25,103
It's our pleasure.

919
01:05:25,246 --> 01:05:29,114
Everything he needs is in the knapsack here. He sleeps in a hammock.

920
01:05:29,250 --> 01:05:31,343
It's in there. He'll set it up somewhere around the yard.

921
01:05:31,452 --> 01:05:33,682
Okay!

922
01:05:33,788 --> 01:05:36,279
Is Richard home
He left early for the office.

923
01:05:36,424 --> 01:05:40,121
Over in the Comex, coffee continues to plunge...

924
01:05:40,261 --> 01:05:43,856
from its high of 97 1I2 less than a week ago.

925
01:05:43,965 --> 01:05:47,628
In trading today, the price of futures was at 68.95.

926
01:05:51,272 --> 01:05:55,971
The blue chip indicator rose slightly..

927
01:05:56,110 --> 01:05:58,635
In other news..

928
01:05:58,780 --> 01:06:01,078
What kind of a dumb name is Mimi Siku ?

929
01:06:01,182 --> 01:06:04,913
Don't be rude. He probably thinks Andrew is a dumb name.

930
01:06:05,019 --> 01:06:07,317
So do I.

931
01:06:07,455 --> 01:06:10,253
I think Mimi Siku is a nice name.
You would.

932
01:06:13,795 --> 01:06:15,922
These are my father's fish.

933
01:06:16,330 --> 01:06:19,265
That's a poe..

934
01:06:19,367 --> 01:06:21,665
Poe.. Uh..

935
01:06:21,803 --> 01:06:26,502
lt's a poecilia latipinna.
They're from the Amazon.

936
01:06:29,310 --> 01:06:31,175
We call it rishi.

937
01:06:31,312 --> 01:06:33,303
Rishi?
Yeah.

938
01:06:33,447 --> 01:06:37,577
Oh. I like that name better.

939
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:41,688
At least I can pronounce it.

940
01:06:45,693 --> 01:06:49,686
Oh! Hi.
Do you like fish, Mimi?

941
01:06:49,831 --> 01:06:54,859
I'm cooking fish for lunch.

942
01:06:55,002 --> 01:06:58,301
"We call it rishi."
Fish.

943
01:07:06,514 --> 01:07:10,507
Oh!
This not fish.

944
01:07:10,651 --> 01:07:13,779
Not taste good.
it's frozen, Mimi.

945
01:07:13,888 --> 01:07:18,484
You have to cook it first.
Oh! Poor thing.

946
01:07:19,060 --> 01:07:21,824
Be honest. Which do you like best for the flower girl's dress?

947
01:07:21,929 --> 01:07:25,194
Yeah?

948
01:07:25,333 --> 01:07:28,234
Michael, it's me!
Richard, not now.

949
01:07:28,369 --> 01:07:32,863
Charlotte and I are just about to..
Look toward the kitchen.

950
01:07:34,408 --> 01:07:36,706
Come here. Come here.
Come here. Come here.

951
01:07:36,844 --> 01:07:39,870
Great. Okay.
All right, Richard. Thanks.

952
01:07:40,014 --> 01:07:42,209
Bye.

953
01:07:42,350 --> 01:07:45,683
Excuse me just for a second, please.

954
01:07:48,422 --> 01:07:50,322
What? What? What?

955
01:07:50,424 --> 01:07:53,689
I made the deal.
What deal?

956
01:07:53,794 --> 01:07:59,323
Uh, with Jovanovic.
After you left, I made the deal.

957
01:07:59,433 --> 01:08:02,596
Are you outta your mind?
Yes, yes.

958
01:08:02,737 --> 01:08:05,570
I am. I am outta my mind. Squid?
No, no, no.

959
01:08:05,706 --> 01:08:08,573
How did you get the certificates out of the vault without my signature?

960
01:08:08,709 --> 01:08:11,542
Well..
You forged my signature?

961
01:08:11,646 --> 01:08:14,342
I'm sorry. I was afraid we would lose everything.

962
01:08:14,448 --> 01:08:18,714
What did you do with the money?
It's here. Here!

963
01:08:18,819 --> 01:08:22,016
You're walking around New York City...

964
01:08:22,123 --> 01:08:24,455
with a million dollars in a suitcase?

965
01:08:24,592 --> 01:08:28,551
Not so loud.
Would you.. It's good.

966
01:08:28,663 --> 01:08:31,257
Hi. The worst part..

967
01:08:31,399 --> 01:08:34,300
There's a worst part?
Oh, yes, there is.

968
01:08:34,435 --> 01:08:38,132
Coffee fell below 75 this morning.

969
01:08:38,272 --> 01:08:40,570
Let me think. Let me think.
Yes.

970
01:08:40,675 --> 01:08:42,267
Come on.

971
01:08:44,612 --> 01:08:50,107
We will go to Jovanovic. Tell him we made a mistake. Give him the money back.

972
01:08:50,251 --> 01:08:53,778
Charlotte, hi.
Richard, what you are doing here?

973
01:08:53,921 --> 01:08:56,947
There's a very big problem...

974
01:08:57,091 --> 01:08:59,150
with the coffee trade.
Don't tell me. You're leaving.

975
01:08:59,293 --> 01:09:02,785
This is very important to me.
And I'm not?

976
01:09:04,498 --> 01:09:07,262
Of course, you're important.

977
01:09:07,368 --> 01:09:10,565
You are the most important thing in the world to me,

978
01:09:10,671 --> 01:09:13,572
except for this other thing I gotta do now.

979
01:09:13,674 --> 01:09:15,801
This better be an emergency.

980
01:09:15,943 --> 01:09:18,844
It is. We're gonna die.

981
01:09:18,980 --> 01:09:21,073
Does anyone know where Mimi is?

982
01:09:21,182 --> 01:09:24,640
Mom, Mimi's doin' something bad.

983
01:09:25,786 --> 01:09:29,085
Oh!

984
01:09:29,190 --> 01:09:33,251
Well, um, isn't that interesting?

985
01:09:33,361 --> 01:09:36,660
Me cook real fish.
You taste?

986
01:09:36,797 --> 01:09:38,822
Try everything once, I always say.

987
01:09:38,966 --> 01:09:42,333
Oh. Hot. Okay.

988
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:45,132
That is very tasty.
Where'd you get the fish?

989
01:09:45,239 --> 01:09:47,764
Mom, Tarzan's eating Daddy's fish.

990
01:09:47,875 --> 01:09:49,672
House pond.

991
01:09:53,047 --> 01:09:55,607
House pond?

992
01:09:55,816 --> 01:09:57,613
We'll manage to survive this, okay?

993
01:09:57,718 --> 01:10:00,448
Easy for you to say.
I got kids to feed. So do I.

994
01:10:00,554 --> 01:10:02,715
But mine want Nike and Nintendo.

995
01:10:02,857 --> 01:10:04,950
Yours wants blowguns and Meow Mix.

996
01:10:07,028 --> 01:10:10,691
Beluga. Best caviar in whole world.

997
01:10:10,831 --> 01:10:12,389
Oh, yes, yes. Bar none.
Delicious.

998
01:10:12,533 --> 01:10:14,057
The best.
Very good.

999
01:10:14,201 --> 01:10:16,066
Taste.

1000
01:10:16,203 --> 01:10:19,468
No, not without toast points.
Tempting, tempting.

1001
01:10:19,573 --> 01:10:21,837
Taste!
Yeah, all right.

1002
01:10:21,942 --> 01:10:25,708
Right out of the fish.
Mmm!

1003
01:10:25,846 --> 01:10:28,713
It's so fishy.
Very fishy. Eggy.

1004
01:10:31,919 --> 01:10:36,549
Morrison tell me coffee now below 70, no?

1005
01:10:36,690 --> 01:10:39,181
We were as shocked as you are.

1006
01:10:39,293 --> 01:10:42,660
Ow.
Much lower than 75.

1007
01:10:42,763 --> 01:10:47,063
It was wrong to sell you the coffee futures.
We want to buy them back.

1008
01:10:47,201 --> 01:10:49,567
How much?
The same.

1009
01:10:49,703 --> 01:10:51,694
A million dollars.

1010
01:10:51,806 --> 01:10:54,570
You lose money?

1011
01:10:54,708 --> 01:10:57,905
Oh! Don't worry about that.

1012
01:10:58,045 --> 01:11:00,707
We value your friendship is what it is.

1013
01:11:00,815 --> 01:11:05,843
And our fingers.
Very good.

1014
01:11:05,953 --> 01:11:08,285
I do not know.

1015
01:11:08,422 --> 01:11:10,720
What's not to know?
You're cleaning up here.

1016
01:11:10,825 --> 01:11:15,421
You are shrewd men.
No, no, no, no.

1017
01:11:15,563 --> 01:11:20,899
Believe me, shrewdness is not in the picture.

1018
01:11:23,838 --> 01:11:26,204
I told you. Time heals everything.

1019
01:11:26,307 --> 01:11:28,741
It just..
Oh, the door's locked.

1020
01:11:28,843 --> 01:11:32,472
Well, that's a statement, I guess. Okay, so..

1021
01:11:32,613 --> 01:11:37,141
I'll keep these certificates at my house and..

1022
01:11:37,284 --> 01:11:39,149
Don't worry about me.

1023
01:11:39,286 --> 01:11:41,948
I'm sure there's a train I can take.

1024
01:11:42,089 --> 01:11:45,320
It's not like it's a dangerous neighborhood or anything.

1025
01:11:45,459 --> 01:11:49,623
Hi. How ya doin'?

1026
01:11:49,763 --> 01:11:51,663
And this is supposed to be a bribe ?

1027
01:11:51,799 --> 01:11:57,066
Is it working?
It's pretty effective.

1028
01:11:57,171 --> 01:12:01,335
I'll get some champagne.

1029
01:12:01,475 --> 01:12:05,241
And I'll change into something more comfortable.

1030
01:12:46,554 --> 01:12:50,115
Huh?

1031
01:12:50,224 --> 01:12:53,955
Oh, no!

1032
01:12:54,061 --> 01:12:57,690
Oh, girl. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to do that.

1033
01:12:57,831 --> 01:13:00,299
That was an accident. Come on.

1034
01:13:00,401 --> 01:13:04,667
Oh. Oh. Ah.

1035
01:13:04,772 --> 01:13:09,573
Coco, Coco. Come on. Coco? Coco?

1036
01:13:09,710 --> 01:13:12,474
Michael, I was thinking about taking tomorrow morning off.

1037
01:13:12,580 --> 01:13:15,708
Yes, that's a great idea.
Whatever you'd like to do.

1038
01:13:15,849 --> 01:13:18,374
'Cause then it would be just you and me, wouldn't it?

1039
01:13:18,519 --> 01:13:20,851
Coco?

1040
01:13:20,955 --> 01:13:23,423
Coco, Coco.

1041
01:13:23,557 --> 01:13:26,720
Here. Snap out of it.
Come on.

1042
01:13:26,860 --> 01:13:28,725
Come on, Coco.
You're killin' me. Wake up!

1043
01:13:28,862 --> 01:13:32,229
Coco, it's a mouse! Go get it!

1044
01:13:32,366 --> 01:13:35,096
Oh.

1045
01:13:35,236 --> 01:13:39,832
Coco, Coco, Coco.
Coco? Coco?

1046
01:13:43,310 --> 01:13:45,210
Mmm.

1047
01:13:57,291 --> 01:13:59,191
Jan!

1048
01:13:59,293 --> 01:14:01,727
Now where is this champagne?

1049
01:14:01,829 --> 01:14:04,423
Let's go in the kitchen.

1050
01:14:04,565 --> 01:14:06,465
You're so feisty today.

1051
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:10,297
It's nice to see you and Coco getting along so well.

1052
01:14:10,437 --> 01:14:12,405
She's fast.

1053
01:14:12,506 --> 01:14:17,409
What do you say we take the champagne and drink it in the bedroom?

1054
01:14:21,181 --> 01:14:23,877
So, uh, let me just get this clear in my head.

1055
01:14:23,984 --> 01:14:29,115
You thought that I wouldn't notice?
Those fish cost thousands of dollars.

1056
01:14:29,256 --> 01:14:32,714
I think what we have here is an intercultural misunderstanding.

1057
01:14:32,826 --> 01:14:35,920
Why don't you tell that to my yellow dwarf cichlids?

1058
01:14:36,030 --> 01:14:38,123
Because they can't hear any more!

1059
01:14:38,265 --> 01:14:41,496
Fish taste good.
Well, let's hope so, Mimi.

1060
01:14:41,635 --> 01:14:44,502
You just downed $10,000 worth of sushi.

1061
01:14:44,638 --> 01:14:47,937
There's still one left.

1062
01:14:48,042 --> 01:14:51,011
Winky.

1063
01:14:52,646 --> 01:14:56,082
My most loyal fish.

1064
01:14:56,183 --> 01:15:00,779
Remember how he used to always follow my finger across the glass?

1065
01:15:02,723 --> 01:15:06,181
Now I'm gonna have to go like this.

1066
01:15:06,327 --> 01:15:09,194
Everybody, go to bed.
It's late. Give me this.

1067
01:15:09,330 --> 01:15:13,323
No.
Come on. All right, keep it.

1068
01:15:13,467 --> 01:15:16,197
Mimi, you go to bed too.
You know, I mean..

1069
01:15:16,337 --> 01:15:20,034
Come on. Come on.
It's one thing to..

1070
01:15:20,174 --> 01:15:24,270
You have no idea what this kind of..
Yes, I know..

1071
01:16:24,772 --> 01:16:27,104
Wait.

1072
01:16:27,241 --> 01:16:29,368
Wait.

1073
01:16:29,476 --> 01:16:32,206
Wait. Now.

1074
01:16:32,312 --> 01:16:35,509
Ah!

1075
01:16:41,588 --> 01:16:43,886
You Pinare now.

1076
01:16:45,793 --> 01:16:47,693
Choose a name.

1077
01:16:47,795 --> 01:16:49,922
Choose for me.

1078
01:16:53,066 --> 01:16:54,931
Ukume.

1079
01:16:55,068 --> 01:16:57,036
What?

1080
01:16:59,606 --> 01:17:02,632
Ukume.
What does it mean?

1081
01:17:04,778 --> 01:17:07,303
It means...

1082
01:17:07,448 --> 01:17:11,282
sound of rain on river water.

1083
01:17:11,418 --> 01:17:15,115
Ukume.
It's pretty.

1084
01:17:58,799 --> 01:18:02,860
Jan! Jan!

1085
01:18:03,003 --> 01:18:06,370
You're goin' to camp.
End of discussion.

1086
01:18:06,507 --> 01:18:08,771
Dad? But Mom, we didn't do anything.
Not understand problem.

1087
01:18:08,876 --> 01:18:11,174
Look, I'll tell you the problem, Mimi.

1088
01:18:11,311 --> 01:18:15,372
You started a wildfire in my yard.
Ya ate my yellow dwarf cichlid...

1089
01:18:15,516 --> 01:18:19,111
and now you're putting the moves on my 12-year-old daughter.

1090
01:18:19,219 --> 01:18:22,154
That's just not true.
Oh, well, there. See?

1091
01:18:22,256 --> 01:18:25,054
Maybe you're overreacting?
I was putting the moves on him.

1092
01:18:25,192 --> 01:18:27,183
Tell me I didn't hear that!

1093
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:30,558
Honey, maybe we should be grateful...

1094
01:18:30,697 --> 01:18:32,528
that this happened at home.

1095
01:18:32,666 --> 01:18:33,894
Mom..
Hold on!

1096
01:18:34,034 --> 01:18:35,467
Nothing happened!

1097
01:18:35,569 --> 01:18:37,628
You know what, Karen?
You're still goin' to camp!

1098
01:18:37,738 --> 01:18:39,638
An all-girls camp!

1099
01:18:39,740 --> 01:18:42,334
Yes!
My name's not Karen any more.

1100
01:18:42,442 --> 01:18:46,037
It's Ukume.
First dibs on Ukume's room.

1101
01:18:48,215 --> 01:18:53,152
Oh, now, this makes me feel a whole lot better!

1102
01:18:54,922 --> 01:18:56,719
Karen? Karen, honey?

1103
01:18:56,857 --> 01:19:01,760
I still don't understand the problem.
Not now. He might bite you.

1104
01:19:01,895 --> 01:19:05,262
Hello?
Richard, it's Morrison.

1105
01:19:05,399 --> 01:19:07,526
Yeah?
Let's just go away.

1106
01:19:07,634 --> 01:19:10,865
I had another visit from Jovanovic.
Yeah?

1107
01:19:10,971 --> 01:19:15,738
Then you haven't seen what's happening?
Seen what?

1108
01:19:15,876 --> 01:19:20,904
Price of coffee is soaring.
Jovanovic thinks you screwed him.

1109
01:19:21,048 --> 01:19:26,111
He may be coming for the certificates.
You mean he's angry?

1110
01:19:26,253 --> 01:19:30,053
You slept like a log last night.

1111
01:19:30,357 --> 01:19:32,382
Charlie?
Hmm?

1112
01:19:32,492 --> 01:19:35,950
How would you feel about Mimi being in the wedding?

1113
01:19:36,096 --> 01:19:40,089
I thought he was gonna be gone by then.

1114
01:19:40,233 --> 01:19:43,100
Remember, it's just you and me.
I remember.

1115
01:19:43,236 --> 01:19:46,569
No business, no Mimi.
What is it, Richard? I can't..

1116
01:19:46,673 --> 01:19:49,198
Stop, stop, stop.
What?

1117
01:19:49,309 --> 01:19:51,971
Oh, my God.

1118
01:19:52,112 --> 01:19:54,910
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Don't panic, please.

1119
01:19:55,015 --> 01:19:58,280
Should we go out for breakfast or stay in?

1120
01:19:58,418 --> 01:20:01,945
Michael?

1121
01:20:02,089 --> 01:20:04,216
Okay, everybody!
Change of plans!

1122
01:20:04,324 --> 01:20:08,886
Jan, you take everyone out for a big breakfast! Bring a change of clothes!

1123
01:20:12,933 --> 01:20:16,835
I told you.
Karen, we don't have time for this.

1124
01:20:16,970 --> 01:20:18,995
I'm not goin' to an all-girls camp.

1125
01:20:19,139 --> 01:20:21,334
Karen, open this door right now!

1126
01:20:21,475 --> 01:20:24,410
Calm down.
What is goin' on?

1127
01:20:24,511 --> 01:20:27,446
...with a big knife!

1128
01:20:27,547 --> 01:20:31,449
Karen, open the door right this minute!

1129
01:20:31,551 --> 01:20:33,519
You get the car ready.
I'll take care of her, okay?

1130
01:20:33,654 --> 01:20:36,179
Go, go! Please, please!
Go! Go.

1131
01:20:36,323 --> 01:20:38,188
Andrew, clear the door.

1132
01:20:44,231 --> 01:20:45,528
Cool.

1133
01:20:48,835 --> 01:20:52,271
Karen! Open this door.

1134
01:20:52,372 --> 01:20:55,933
Karen, open this door right now.
Do you hear me?

1135
01:20:56,043 --> 01:20:59,809
Your father's very mad.
I'm not coming out!

1136
01:21:12,426 --> 01:21:14,053
I'll get matches.
We'll smoke her out.

1137
01:21:14,194 --> 01:21:15,718
Andrew, get back here.
I can handle this.

1138
01:21:15,862 --> 01:21:20,993
Karen, this is getting really, really boring!

1139
01:21:21,101 --> 01:21:24,537
Open it! Come on!
Any word from the Russians?

1140
01:21:24,671 --> 01:21:26,901
Not yet. No, no.
Karen! Open up!

1141
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:30,237
What's goin' on?
Karen locked herself in the bedroom.

1142
01:21:30,377 --> 01:21:34,074
Come on, honey. Open this door, or you know what's gonna happen?

1143
01:21:34,214 --> 01:21:37,047
Andrew is gonna smoke you out!
Cool!

1144
01:21:37,184 --> 01:21:39,049
I am kidding. Get back here.
Calm down.

1145
01:21:39,186 --> 01:21:41,347
Please, calm down.
Where's Mimi?

1146
01:21:41,455 --> 01:21:44,754
I don't know. He's probably in a bar hitting on a cocktail waitress.

1147
01:21:44,891 --> 01:21:48,156
What?
Karen. Your son spent the night in his hammock with my daughter.

1148
01:21:48,261 --> 01:21:50,024
Okay?

1149
01:21:50,130 --> 01:21:52,155
Was there a pot involved?
No, there was no pot involved.

1150
01:21:52,265 --> 01:21:54,165
You have nothing to be upset about.

1151
01:21:54,267 --> 01:21:56,167
There is nothing to be upset about?
No!

1152
01:21:56,269 --> 01:21:58,760
Come here.

1153
01:21:58,905 --> 01:22:01,032
There's no reason to be upset, huh?

1154
01:22:01,141 --> 01:22:05,009
How about the fact that your son ate my prizewinning fish, including Winky.

1155
01:22:05,112 --> 01:22:07,239
And the fact that the Russian Mafia is due here any moment.

1156
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:09,541
I guess you're right.

1157
01:22:09,649 --> 01:22:14,586
That's a pain that's here to stay.

1158
01:22:14,721 --> 01:22:16,916
Screaming's no way to deal with a child.

1159
01:22:17,057 --> 01:22:21,016
You've been a father for 3 days, you're giving me lessons?

1160
01:22:21,128 --> 01:22:22,686
You sound like an idiot.

1161
01:22:22,796 --> 01:22:25,264
I'm a parent, therefore, I'm an idiot.

1162
01:22:25,398 --> 01:22:28,060
I have spent every day for the last 12 years worrying about my kids.

1163
01:22:28,168 --> 01:22:30,398
About their safety, about their happiness, their crooked teeth.

1164
01:22:30,504 --> 01:22:32,870
No offense.
None taken.

1165
01:22:32,973 --> 01:22:36,409
None of this means anything, because in the next few days your son will be gone.

1166
01:22:36,510 --> 01:22:41,243
Open this door!
Karen! Open up!

1167
01:22:41,348 --> 01:22:43,578
I've gotta get her out of here.

1168
01:22:43,683 --> 01:22:46,811
Look, two shoulders are better than one, right? Come on.

1169
01:22:46,953 --> 01:22:51,754
Baboon is here.
He made peace.

1170
01:23:00,333 --> 01:23:02,233
All right!

1171
01:23:05,705 --> 01:23:08,731
Oh.
Awesome fall, Dad.

1172
01:23:08,842 --> 01:23:11,572
Thank you, Andrew.

1173
01:23:11,678 --> 01:23:16,274
Okay, we gotta get Jan and the kids in the car before Jovanovic gets here.

1174
01:23:16,383 --> 01:23:18,112
Andrew, meet me downstairs.

1175
01:23:18,218 --> 01:23:23,349
Are you okay, Daddy?
I'm fine. Let me lean on ya, honey.

1176
01:23:23,490 --> 01:23:26,755
Mimi, come on downstairs.
Coming.

1177
01:23:26,860 --> 01:23:31,160
Anybody can land on their feet.

1178
01:23:31,298 --> 01:23:34,699
Okay, Andrew, let's go!
Where are we going?

1179
01:23:34,835 --> 01:23:37,030
French toast sale going on.
Oh!

1180
01:23:39,005 --> 01:23:41,701
Good morning.

1181
01:23:44,578 --> 01:23:46,512
Sorry.

1182
01:23:52,052 --> 01:23:53,952
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

1183
01:23:54,054 --> 01:23:56,682
Give me coffee certificates.

1184
01:23:56,823 --> 01:24:02,318
You don't think I would keep certificates around my house?

1185
01:24:02,429 --> 01:24:05,523
Don't make me lose temper.

1186
01:24:05,665 --> 01:24:07,530
Ow. Ow. Ow.

1187
01:24:07,667 --> 01:24:09,532
Dad keeps everything in the bookcase.

1188
01:24:09,669 --> 01:24:11,330
Andrew! Ow!

1189
01:24:11,438 --> 01:24:13,906
Behind the Bible and Judith Krantz.

1190
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:18,739
Thank you, Andrew.

1191
01:24:24,751 --> 01:24:29,245
Oh. Scruples.

1192
01:24:29,389 --> 01:24:32,722
Could not put it down.

1193
01:24:35,629 --> 01:24:38,223
Oh!

1194
01:24:38,365 --> 01:24:42,324
All right, so, uh, you have your certificates.

1195
01:24:42,435 --> 01:24:45,666
And I would appreciate it if you would just take them and leave my house.

1196
01:24:45,772 --> 01:24:48,764
Sit.
Sure.

1197
01:24:48,909 --> 01:24:54,211
First, I teach never to make fool of Jovanovic again.

1198
01:24:54,314 --> 01:24:56,714
Rope him down.

1199
01:24:58,151 --> 01:25:00,278
"Rope him down"?

1200
01:25:00,420 --> 01:25:04,186
I have an idea.

1201
01:25:04,291 --> 01:25:07,124
You'll need these.
What? What?

1202
01:25:12,632 --> 01:25:15,226
Ow!

1203
01:25:15,335 --> 01:25:18,634
Couldn't we discuss this over a lovely cup of coffee?

1204
01:25:18,772 --> 01:25:21,070
Quiet!
Or Jan could whip up some borscht.

1205
01:25:21,174 --> 01:25:23,472
You make a fool of Jovanovic...
No.

1206
01:25:23,610 --> 01:25:25,976
in front of my comrades and my community.

1207
01:25:26,112 --> 01:25:29,741
You waste my time.
You try to cheat me.

1208
01:25:29,849 --> 01:25:33,410
Oh!
Now... you must pay.

1209
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:35,147
Ooh!

1210
01:25:35,288 --> 01:25:37,620
Sit still, coward.

1211
01:25:37,757 --> 01:25:40,419
Now, I teach you...

1212
01:25:40,527 --> 01:25:45,055
never... never to make a fool of Jovanovic again.

1213
01:25:47,634 --> 01:25:50,125
Eeny?

1214
01:25:50,270 --> 01:25:52,500
Meeny?
Uh-uh.

1215
01:25:52,639 --> 01:25:55,506
Miney?
No, need that one for traffic.

1216
01:25:55,642 --> 01:25:59,476
Mo?

1217
01:26:08,888 --> 01:26:11,413
Huh?

1218
01:26:12,892 --> 01:26:14,359
What?

1219
01:26:14,494 --> 01:26:17,361
Eee! Spider!

1220
01:26:17,497 --> 01:26:20,159
I hate spiders!

1221
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:22,461
Kill spider!
Kill spider quickly!

1222
01:26:22,569 --> 01:26:23,831
Not me! Spider!

1223
01:26:23,970 --> 01:26:25,835
Don't move!
The spider could kill you.

1224
01:26:25,972 --> 01:26:28,463
Kill spider.
Shoot, boy. Go ahead.

1225
01:26:28,575 --> 01:26:31,169
Don't worry about mess!

1226
01:26:31,311 --> 01:26:35,008
Get him, Mimi!
I'm coming, Daddy!

1227
01:26:36,750 --> 01:26:39,184
Aah!

1228
01:26:42,389 --> 01:26:43,720
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

1229
01:26:45,091 --> 01:26:46,683
Aah!
Get away!

1230
01:26:46,826 --> 01:26:48,555
Don't you do that to my son!

1231
01:26:48,695 --> 01:26:51,163
Show 'em what the Kempsters are made of!

1232
01:26:51,264 --> 01:26:54,893
Bite 'im, Andrew!
Use those crooked teeth!

1233
01:26:57,737 --> 01:27:01,229
Crap!

1234
01:27:01,374 --> 01:27:03,467
Shoot again, Baboon!
Shoot again!

1235
01:27:06,279 --> 01:27:07,837
Ah!

1236
01:27:08,915 --> 01:27:11,884
Aah!
Good boy, Andrew!

1237
01:27:20,727 --> 01:27:21,921
Daddy?

1238
01:27:25,532 --> 01:27:28,057
Don't shoot.

1239
01:27:28,201 --> 01:27:30,726
Oh.

1240
01:27:55,462 --> 01:27:58,863
Baboon, when thumb doesn't work, Pinare do this.

1241
01:28:02,135 --> 01:28:05,696
Oh, that's gotta hurt.
Ooh!

1242
01:28:11,911 --> 01:28:14,277
I'm startin' to really like that spider.

1243
01:28:18,785 --> 01:28:21,777
Please, don't punch spider at me any longer!

1244
01:28:21,921 --> 01:28:23,912
I'm going. I'm going.

1245
01:28:26,926 --> 01:28:30,225
I have many enemies but none like that spider.

1246
01:28:30,330 --> 01:28:32,924
Drive!

I want you to have this.

1252
01:28:58,791 --> 01:29:01,419
Well, Mimi, here's all your stuff.

1253
01:29:01,528 --> 01:29:07,262
Better get goin', huh?
Your dad's waiting.

1254
01:29:07,367 --> 01:29:11,098
Bye, Michael.
Bye, Mimi.

1255
01:29:23,516 --> 01:29:25,814
Come on.
I'm gonna take you someplace.

1256
01:29:47,006 --> 01:29:50,498
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Excuse me. Excuse me.

1257
01:29:50,610 --> 01:29:53,875
Come on.

1258
01:29:55,682 --> 01:29:57,809
Last time I was here...

1259
01:29:57,917 --> 01:30:02,911
I bought that for your mom.

1260
01:30:03,056 --> 01:30:05,889
I want to go back home.

1261
01:30:06,025 --> 01:30:09,085
You sick?
No.

1262
01:30:09,229 --> 01:30:11,094
You sure?

1263
01:30:13,566 --> 01:30:17,866
All right, um, but we got to come back here in a couple of days. Tell you why.

1264
01:30:17,971 --> 01:30:21,429
Fourth of July. It's like that Fanenteyou celebration of yours.

1265
01:30:21,574 --> 01:30:24,941
But here it's big. There's boats everywhere and thousands of people.

1266
01:30:25,078 --> 01:30:28,241
And at night, they shoot off fire in the sky like you've never seen.

1267
01:30:28,381 --> 01:30:31,839
I fail the chief, Baboon.

1268
01:30:31,951 --> 01:30:34,283
How did you fail the chief?

1269
01:30:34,420 --> 01:30:37,355
Didn't get the fire from the Statue of Liberty.

1270
01:30:37,457 --> 01:30:40,255
The fire isn't real.

1271
01:30:40,393 --> 01:30:43,362
The fire's in here.

1272
01:30:43,463 --> 01:30:45,727
Chief knows that.

1273
01:30:45,832 --> 01:30:50,064
I miss Paliku.

1274
01:30:50,169 --> 01:30:53,366
I want to go back home.

1275
01:30:55,808 --> 01:30:58,072
Home.

1276
01:31:01,681 --> 01:31:03,774
All right.

1277
01:31:25,338 --> 01:31:29,172
Ouch. Oh.
Almost forgot.

1278
01:31:29,309 --> 01:31:32,278
You'll be needin' this.

1279
01:31:32,378 --> 01:31:34,846
You keep it.
No, Mimi.

1280
01:31:34,981 --> 01:31:36,846
No, no, no.
Here.

1281
01:31:36,983 --> 01:31:39,975
If you kill a fly, you will be a real Pinare.

1282
01:31:40,119 --> 01:31:42,917
Yeah, like that's gonna happen.

1283
01:31:43,022 --> 01:31:46,651
You know, I will practice.

1284
01:31:46,793 --> 01:31:50,786
That way I can come down and hunt with you.

1285
01:31:53,132 --> 01:31:55,794
You'll never come to Lipo Lipo.

1286
01:31:55,902 --> 01:31:58,598
American Airlines announces the final boarding call...

1287
01:31:58,705 --> 01:32:01,367
for Flight 935 to Caracas, Venezuela.

1288
01:32:01,507 --> 01:32:03,975
Time to go.
Gate 48.

1289
01:32:04,077 --> 01:32:07,103
All passengers..
Thanks for the blowgun.

1290
01:32:07,213 --> 01:32:09,204
Mimi, got you somethin'.

1291
01:32:09,349 --> 01:32:12,648
It's for you, but I want you to open it in the plane.

1292
01:32:12,752 --> 01:32:16,813
Don't open it now.
I also got ya...

1293
01:32:16,923 --> 01:32:18,823
this.

1294
01:32:27,900 --> 01:32:31,802
Fire from Statue.

1295
01:32:31,904 --> 01:32:35,237
Fire from Statue.
Pretty cool, huh?

1296
01:32:37,276 --> 01:32:40,006
Be careful with it though.

1297
01:32:48,755 --> 01:32:50,689
Wakatepe.

1298
01:32:51,958 --> 01:32:55,587
Wakatepe.

1299
01:34:14,640 --> 01:34:16,767
Charlie, I got a great idea.

1300
01:34:17,276 --> 01:34:22,236
What do you say you and I get the hell outta here?

1301
01:34:22,515 --> 01:34:24,506
Tomorrow.
Just the two of us.

1302
01:34:24,650 --> 01:34:28,177
Head out to our favorite spa, that big suite. Get to know each other again.

1303
01:34:28,321 --> 01:34:31,347
That's not good for me, darling.
Me neither.

1304
01:34:31,491 --> 01:34:34,085
I really want to film all that,

1305
01:34:34,193 --> 01:34:39,324
but I've got an appointment with my chiropractor this weekend.

1306
01:34:39,465 --> 01:34:42,992
You know my back affects my work.
Oh, I know.

1307
01:34:43,135 --> 01:34:45,968
We could do it a week Friday.
That's not good for me.

1308
01:34:46,072 --> 01:34:47,869
It's good for Ian.

1309
01:34:48,007 --> 01:34:51,534
Whatever's good for Ian.
I suggest a following Wednesday.

1310
01:34:51,677 --> 01:34:56,114
Wednesdays are good.

1311
01:35:14,066 --> 01:35:18,196
Cromwell ! Coffee's up another two points.

1312
01:35:18,337 --> 01:35:20,567
My boys, I never doubted you for a minute.

1313
01:35:20,706 --> 01:35:24,301
We go to the trading floor with those certificates and make money.

1314
01:35:24,410 --> 01:35:26,310
Money is honey.

1315
01:35:29,949 --> 01:35:33,214
Oh, look at those prices!

1316
01:35:33,352 --> 01:35:37,584
Boys, we're gonna clean up.

1317
01:35:49,936 --> 01:35:54,430
I ever tell you about cocoa in '73?
Many times.

1318
01:35:54,574 --> 01:35:56,166
There I was with 800 lots of cocoa,

1319
01:35:57,643 --> 01:36:01,204
back in the days before greed became a dirty word.

1320
01:36:01,314 --> 01:36:04,374
Now, I don't have to explain that to you, my boy.

1321
01:36:04,483 --> 01:36:07,008
You're a professional.

1322
01:36:07,119 --> 01:36:11,078
But that Cromwell, he's a disaster waiting to happen.

1323
01:36:11,223 --> 01:36:14,215
I don't know what's going on with him.

1324
01:36:14,327 --> 01:36:19,458
Between me and you, Cromwell has become a colossal pain in the..

1325
01:36:19,599 --> 01:36:21,294
Ooh!

1326
01:36:35,348 --> 01:36:37,248
Yes!

1327
01:36:39,018 --> 01:36:40,918
Yes!

1328
01:36:41,020 --> 01:36:45,320
Uh, George?
Uh, get him something..

1329
01:36:45,458 --> 01:36:47,426
Michael!
Where you goin'?

1330
01:36:47,526 --> 01:36:52,156
"Not only did he learn by.."
"Experience."

1331
01:36:52,298 --> 01:36:54,789
"Experience, but...

1332
01:36:54,934 --> 01:36:56,902
"instincts...
Good.

1333
01:36:57,003 --> 01:37:00,666
long dead, became alive again."

1334
01:37:12,318 --> 01:37:14,183
Baboon?
I nailed a fly.

1335
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:16,185
No!
You don't believe me?

1336
01:37:16,322 --> 01:37:18,187
I'll show you.
When?

1337
01:37:18,324 --> 01:37:21,452
Right now.

1338
01:37:25,965 --> 01:37:29,196
Baboon!

1339
01:37:29,335 --> 01:37:32,327
Baboon!

1340
01:37:32,471 --> 01:37:34,996
Baboon!

1341
01:37:35,141 --> 01:37:37,132
Oh!

1342
01:37:40,312 --> 01:37:41,939
Oh!

1343
01:37:42,048 --> 01:37:44,278
Look at you.

1344
01:37:44,383 --> 01:37:46,681
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1345
01:37:54,927 --> 01:37:56,895
Now you're a Pinare, Baboon.

1346
01:37:59,098 --> 01:38:01,862
Will you stay with me in Lipo Lipo?

1347
01:38:02,001 --> 01:38:06,802
For a while.
If you teach me how to hunt.

1348
01:38:06,906 --> 01:38:11,138
Oh. Got you something.

1349
01:38:11,243 --> 01:38:13,541
Maybe you can use this.
Oh!

1350
01:38:13,679 --> 01:38:16,648
The real deal.

1351
01:38:19,385 --> 01:38:21,353
How's Karen?

1352
01:38:21,454 --> 01:38:25,584
I don't know.
Why don't you ask her yourself?

1353
01:38:30,129 --> 01:38:33,223
Now that's a very big bug.

1354
01:38:33,365 --> 01:38:37,426
Honey, this isn't one of those topless tribes, is it?

1355
01:38:37,570 --> 01:38:39,538
Don't even think about that, Andrew.

1356
01:38:39,638 --> 01:38:43,039
I can't, Dad.
I'm too nauseous from the boat ride.

1357
01:38:43,142 --> 01:38:47,772
Ukume! Ukume!

1358
01:38:47,913 --> 01:38:51,371
Mimi! Mimi!

1359
01:38:51,484 --> 01:38:54,453
Karen!
Ah!

1360
01:39:46,038 --> 01:39:47,938
