1
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,700
<i>Five years ago, my dad left.</i>

2
00:00:46,776 --> 00:00:51,076
<i>He said he loved me and my mom,
but he needed his own space.</i>

3
00:00:52,615 --> 00:00:55,140
<i>He took his secretary along with him.</i>

4
00:00:55,218 --> 00:00:57,686
<i>He said he needed someone
to answer his phone calls.</i>

5
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:03,723
<i>He promised to come visit me
from time to time...</i>

6
00:01:03,793 --> 00:01:06,921
<i>but he was never very good
at keeping promises.</i>

7
00:01:15,104 --> 00:01:17,732
<i>My mom was really upset.</i>

8
00:01:17,807 --> 00:01:20,275
<i>But I told her
we still had each other.</i>

9
00:01:20,343 --> 00:01:23,210
<i>And I'd look after her
as long as I lived.</i>

10
00:01:27,617 --> 00:01:30,245
<i>We decided to start all over again.</i>

11
00:01:32,722 --> 00:01:35,088
<i>A whole new life.</i>

12
00:01:42,131 --> 00:01:45,589
<i>So we moved into a small
loft apartment downtown.</i>

13
00:01:53,443 --> 00:01:56,435
<i>It was pretty gross at first.</i>

14
00:01:56,512 --> 00:02:00,278
<i>But my mom's real creative,
and she turned it into a home in no time.</i>

15
00:02:04,087 --> 00:02:08,251
<i>She even created a kind of backyard garden
on the roof where I could play.</i>

16
00:02:18,534 --> 00:02:22,061
<i>After a while,
she got over my father leaving.</i>

17
00:02:22,138 --> 00:02:24,197
<i>I did too.</i>

18
00:02:25,675 --> 00:02:27,768
<i>Eventually, she started dating again.</i>

19
00:02:29,178 --> 00:02:31,339
<i>But they were all jerks.</i>

20
00:02:36,152 --> 00:02:38,086
<i>And they never lasted long.</i>

21
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:43,850
<i>And eventually, we would
go back to the way things were.</i>

22
00:02:43,926 --> 00:02:46,190
<i>Just the two of us.</i>

23
00:02:47,997 --> 00:02:50,158
<i>I liked it that way.</i>

24
00:02:52,802 --> 00:02:56,329
<i>We started making a collage
from things we found on the beach...</i>

25
00:02:56,406 --> 00:02:59,000
<i>to take our minds off everything
that had happened.</i>

26
00:02:59,075 --> 00:03:02,101
<i>We've been doing it now
for almost five years.</i>

27
00:03:03,613 --> 00:03:05,843
<i>My mom says
we'll finish it someday.</i>

28
00:03:05,915 --> 00:03:09,248
Up top. Right there.

29
00:03:09,318 --> 00:03:11,252
Yeah, that's it.

30
00:03:13,289 --> 00:03:17,020
<i>Then two weeks ago, the worst thing
in the world happened.</i>

31
00:03:17,093 --> 00:03:21,052
<i>My mom told me she wanted
to get married again.</i>

32
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,064
<i>Just when we get our life
back together...</i>

33
00:03:23,132 --> 00:03:25,396
<i>she has to go and do
something like this.</i>

34
00:03:25,468 --> 00:03:28,403
<i>You'd think by now she would
have learned her lesson.</i>

35
00:03:36,846 --> 00:03:40,338
<i>I don't care how old I get,
I'll never understand women.</i>

36
00:03:45,676 --> 00:03:48,873
The federal district court of the state
of Washington is now in session.

37
00:03:48,946 --> 00:03:51,039
The defendant will rise.

38
00:03:53,417 --> 00:03:55,351
Frances James Renda...

39
00:03:55,419 --> 00:03:58,752
you have been found guilty
of the crime...

40
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:02,155
of trafficking in narcotics.

41
00:04:02,226 --> 00:04:07,630
Do you have anything to say to this
court before sentence is passed?

42
00:04:07,698 --> 00:04:11,134
Yes, Your Honor. I wanna thank
the prosecuting attorney...

43
00:04:11,201 --> 00:04:13,863
for giving me a fair trial.

44
00:04:13,937 --> 00:04:18,636
And I want him to know there are
no hard feelings in spite of the outcome.

45
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:22,736
And I also wish him a lot of luck
in his future endeavors.

46
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:26,380
Your Honor, Prosecuting Attorney
would like to know...

47
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:29,544
if the defendant's remarks
are in the nature of a threat.

48
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:33,181
The prosecuting attorney
has me all wrong, Your Honor.

49
00:04:33,257 --> 00:04:36,715
I'm a harmless old man.
I don't make threats.

50
00:04:36,793 --> 00:04:38,818
Well, that's good,
because for a moment there...

51
00:04:38,896 --> 00:04:42,423
the prosecuting attorney
was really, really scared.

52
00:04:42,499 --> 00:04:44,831
That'll do, Mr. Sturges.

53
00:04:44,902 --> 00:04:48,167
- Thank you, Your Honor.
- Now, if you two gentlemen are finished...

54
00:04:48,238 --> 00:04:50,729
I'd like to pronounce sentence.

55
00:04:50,807 --> 00:04:53,037
Frances James Renda...

56
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:56,671
it is the judgment of this court that
you serve not less than 50 years...

57
00:04:56,747 --> 00:05:01,343
in the federal correctional
institute at Sheridan, Oregon.

58
00:05:01,418 --> 00:05:04,182
This court is adjourned.

59
00:05:04,254 --> 00:05:06,814
- All rise.
- We'll appeal this. Don't worry.

60
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,949
- We'll appeal.
- We'll appeal, huh?

61
00:05:09,026 --> 00:05:11,551
- Congratulations, buddy.
- Congratulations, Jack. You're the best.

62
00:05:11,628 --> 00:05:13,755
That's one more piece
of garbage off the street.

63
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:17,231
Mr. Renda, this way, please.

64
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:27,210
Well, that's done.
We can go.

65
00:05:27,277 --> 00:05:29,711
Hey, Sturges.

66
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,941
You think you're pretty tough,
don't you?

67
00:05:32,015 --> 00:05:35,109
Well, let me tell you something,
Counselor.

68
00:05:35,185 --> 00:05:38,814
You may be on top of the situation now,
but keep in mind...

69
00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:42,052
things have a way of coming' around.

70
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,059
Know what I mean?

71
00:05:44,127 --> 00:05:46,925
Well, Joey, if you're one of
those things that comes around...

72
00:05:46,997 --> 00:05:49,795
I'm gonna step on you like a bug.

73
00:05:49,866 --> 00:05:52,198
You know what I mean?

74
00:05:58,475 --> 00:06:01,967
- Who was that guy?
- That's Frank's son Joey.

75
00:06:02,045 --> 00:06:04,240
- He looks dangerous.
- I've dealt with a hundred of these guys.

76
00:06:04,314 --> 00:06:06,874
They're just cheap hoods in expensive suits.
Let's get out of here.

77
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,111
We got more important things
to talk about.

78
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,615
I'm gonna get this guy.

79
00:06:18,495 --> 00:06:22,397
I thought I'd bring my stuff over
around noon tomorrow. Is that okay?

80
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:24,127
Sure.

81
00:06:28,405 --> 00:06:31,033
You have room for my big ball
of used dental floss or not?

82
00:06:31,108 --> 00:06:33,474
Oh, I'm sure we'll find room for it.

83
00:06:33,543 --> 00:06:35,943
Been saving it since
I was three years old.

84
00:06:36,013 --> 00:06:39,608
Hate to separate from it.
It must be about 400 pounds now.

85
00:06:39,683 --> 00:06:41,776
What? What'd you say
you were brining?

86
00:06:41,852 --> 00:06:44,683
Nothing. I just wanted
to get your attention.

87
00:06:44,684 --> 00:06:46,653
You've been distracted all day.

88
00:06:46,723 --> 00:06:49,521
Is it the opening of your show
or is something else bothering you?

89
00:06:49,593 --> 00:06:54,030
No. No, I guess I've just been thinking
about you moving in with me and Ben.

90
00:06:54,097 --> 00:06:55,918
You're not having
second thoughts, are you?

91
00:06:56,233 --> 00:06:58,963
No. I want you to move in.
It's Ben.

92
00:06:59,036 --> 00:07:01,903
What? It's Ben?

93
00:07:01,972 --> 00:07:04,736
Wait-Wait-Wait a minute.

94
00:07:04,808 --> 00:07:06,673
Ben doesn't want me to move in?

95
00:07:06,743 --> 00:07:09,803
No, I guess he's just not comfortable
with the idea yet.

96
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,441
Oh, well, if that's all
you're worried about, relax.

97
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:15,644
I knew Ben would have
those feelings.

98
00:07:15,719 --> 00:07:20,383
So I went out and I got just about
every book I could find on step-parenting.

99
00:07:20,457 --> 00:07:21,947
Practically an expert.

100
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,621
This is all about sex, isn't it?

101
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:29,325
- Please, Ben, I'm your mother!
- You don't have to pretend.

102
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:32,857
I already know women reach
their sexual peak in their thirties.

103
00:07:32,936 --> 00:07:34,904
Where'd you pick up
that kind of stuff?

104
00:07:34,971 --> 00:07:36,905
Donahue.

105
00:07:37,908 --> 00:07:40,502
I'm getting rid of the television set.

106
00:07:40,577 --> 00:07:43,671
- Hey, how about this?
- Oh, good one.

107
00:07:43,747 --> 00:07:47,911
Anyway, it's not just about sex.
I think it'd be a good idea for you...

108
00:07:47,984 --> 00:07:50,612
to have an adult male
around the house as a role model.

109
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:55,756
Well, what if he turns out to be like
Dad and splits with his secretary?

110
00:07:55,826 --> 00:07:57,851
He's not like your dad.

111
00:07:57,928 --> 00:08:00,362
Anyway, his secretary's
about 100 years old.

112
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:02,249
Yeah, but what if he
turns out to be a...

113
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,457
serial killer and tries
to boil our heads in acid?

114
00:08:04,534 --> 00:08:08,664
- You're stretching, Benjamin.
- That could happen.

115
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:11,867
This is just a trial period. And Jack's
gonna keep his own apartment.

116
00:08:11,942 --> 00:08:16,675
So if for some reason things don't work out,
he'll go back to his place.

117
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:19,238
And you and I will go back
to the way we were.

118
00:08:19,316 --> 00:08:21,250
Okay?

119
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,279
Did you know he actually
irons his jeans?

120
00:08:25,355 --> 00:08:29,792
Yes. And I'm sure you're gonna tell me
that makes him an ax murderer.

121
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:33,853
Well, I don't know that for sure.

122
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,296
All I'm saying is that
a compulsion like that...

123
00:08:36,366 --> 00:08:39,096
generally indicates a deeper psychosis.

124
00:08:42,372 --> 00:08:44,306
I heard it on Geraldo.

125
00:08:48,378 --> 00:08:50,505
Look, Ben.

126
00:08:51,581 --> 00:08:55,950
I love Jack and I'd like
to have a husband again.

127
00:08:56,019 --> 00:08:59,011
But you're the most
important man in my life.

128
00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:03,549
And if it doesn't work for you,
it doesn't work for me.

129
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:06,653
Okay? Okay?

130
00:09:08,698 --> 00:09:10,632
Yeah, okay.

131
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:16,996
But I still think he might try
and boil our heads in acid.

132
00:09:24,681 --> 00:09:26,615
I knew it.

133
00:09:33,523 --> 00:09:37,425
Let's see. Sturges. Sturges.

134
00:09:39,095 --> 00:09:41,120
Not here.

135
00:09:41,198 --> 00:09:44,099
Well, it doesn't mean
he's not a serial killer.

136
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:47,432
It just means they
haven't caught him yet.

137
00:09:51,842 --> 00:09:54,037
Ben, can you give us a hand?

138
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:58,547
I've got a sore back. My doctor says
I shouldn't do any heavy lifting.

139
00:09:58,615 --> 00:10:01,778
Well, perhaps you can do something light,
like make some room for Jack's things...

140
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:04,514
in the closet under the stairs.

141
00:10:04,588 --> 00:10:07,716
But that's where we keep
all the stuff we collect on the beach.

142
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:10,817
Well, we can put it somewhere else
for the time being.

143
00:10:10,894 --> 00:10:12,987
But it's important stuff.

144
00:10:13,063 --> 00:10:15,657
It'll be fine if we
put it somewhere else.

145
00:10:15,732 --> 00:10:18,496
Oh, that's okay. I don't need
to unpack all my stuff right now.

146
00:10:18,568 --> 00:10:21,537
I can just hold this. It's more convenient
if I need to get anything.

147
00:10:21,605 --> 00:10:24,403
No, it's no trouble.
Is it, Benjamin?

148
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:28,744
No.

149
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:32,481
It's no trouble.

150
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,920
Thanks, Benny. I appreciate it.

151
00:10:38,989 --> 00:10:41,480
He's calling me Benny already.

152
00:10:48,198 --> 00:10:50,428
I meant to tell you.
He hates to be called Benny.

153
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,559
No Benny? Thanks, Ben.

00:11:44,722 --> 00:11:47,987
I'm covered with soap.
Could I just come in?

167
00:11:50,628 --> 00:11:52,289
What are you doing?

168
00:11:52,363 --> 00:11:54,957
Ben locked me out
of the bathroom.

169
00:11:55,033 --> 00:11:57,058
You don't think he did it
on purpose, do you?

170
00:11:57,135 --> 00:12:01,094
Of course not.
I'll get you a towel.

171
00:12:08,713 --> 00:12:12,114
Whoa! What is all this stuff?

172
00:12:17,388 --> 00:12:21,324
What's wrong with this guy?
Is he decomposing or something?

173
00:12:27,132 --> 00:12:29,259
Allergy medicine? Great.

174
00:12:29,334 --> 00:12:33,270
He smells bad and he's a wimp.
What a role model.

175
00:12:34,806 --> 00:12:37,070
Hey, Mom, where's my toothpaste?

176
00:12:37,142 --> 00:12:39,804
I can't find any of my stuff!

177
00:12:43,381 --> 00:12:44,871
Excuse me.

178
00:12:46,217 --> 00:12:48,378
Do you guys have to do that?

179
00:12:48,453 --> 00:12:51,479
Sorry. Can't resist a pretty girl.

180
00:12:51,556 --> 00:12:53,490
You know what I mean, buddy?

181
00:12:54,425 --> 00:12:56,689
I'm 11.
I hate girls.

182
00:12:57,562 --> 00:12:59,553
Oh, right, of course.

183
00:12:59,631 --> 00:13:03,226
I used to be 11 myself.
I know exactly what you mean.

184
00:13:03,301 --> 00:13:05,428
Cooties, right?

185
00:13:05,503 --> 00:13:07,733
Yeah, right, cooties.

186
00:13:07,805 --> 00:13:11,468
Mom, I can't find my toothpaste.
I can't find anything. All my stuff's gone.

187
00:13:11,543 --> 00:13:14,046
It's not gone. I put it
in the cabinet on the floor.

188
00:13:14,047 --> 00:13:15,502
Well, what'd you do that for?

189
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,815
Because Jack's taller,
so it makes more sense...

190
00:13:17,816 --> 00:13:19,914
for his stuff to be up
in the medicine chest.

191
00:13:19,984 --> 00:13:20,753
But, Mom...

192
00:13:20,754 --> 00:13:25,718
Oh, it's not gonna kill you for
your toothpaste to be in the cabinet.

193
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,883
Don't give me that face.

194
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:30,450
We all have to make adjustments
around here.

195
00:13:36,634 --> 00:13:39,865
I'm the one making
all the adjustments.

196
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:45,737
Well, I'm beat.
Gonna turn in.

197
00:13:46,744 --> 00:13:49,975
See you in the morning, Benny.
Oops. Sorry.

198
00:13:50,048 --> 00:13:53,040
I meant Ben.
See you in the morning, Ben.

199
00:13:58,556 --> 00:14:03,118
Oh, Mom, could I talk to you
for a minute, please?

200
00:14:06,397 --> 00:14:10,527
I'm sorry. Ben said the thought of us
being in the same bed...

201
00:14:10,602 --> 00:14:13,435
would be psychologically
damaging to him.

202
00:14:13,504 --> 00:14:16,439
Did he actually use those words,
"psychologically damaging"?

203
00:14:16,507 --> 00:14:19,567
He's a very bright kid.
He watches PBS.

204
00:14:19,644 --> 00:14:21,669
So do I, but I don't talk like that.

205
00:14:21,746 --> 00:14:25,648
I think it'll be okay in a few days.
Just let him get used to the situation.

206
00:14:26,918 --> 00:14:29,079
Okay. Okay.

207
00:14:29,153 --> 00:14:32,089
At least now I'm glad
I had that cold shower.

208
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:32,884
Thank you.

209
00:14:35,326 --> 00:14:37,521
I knew you'd understand.

210
00:14:37,595 --> 00:14:40,530
Hey, don't start anything
you can't finish.

211
00:14:40,598 --> 00:14:42,190
Okay.

212
00:14:43,635 --> 00:14:46,229
- Good night.
- Good night, sweetheart.

213
00:15:02,887 --> 00:15:04,821
This isn't so bad.

214
00:15:10,328 --> 00:15:12,262
I can live with this.

215
00:15:14,065 --> 00:15:15,657
This sucks.

216
00:15:21,172 --> 00:15:23,299
I'm never gonna get any sleep.

217
00:15:43,328 --> 00:15:44,666
Jack, what are you doing?

218
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:47,287
Nothing. Just a little
late-night skateboarding.

219
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,118
What's going on down there?

220
00:15:51,119 --> 00:15:52,401
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

221
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:55,064
I heard a noise.
What was it?

222
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:55,964
Oh, that was me.

223
00:15:55,965 --> 00:15:58,233
I... Just trying to
get to the bathroom...

224
00:15:58,309 --> 00:16:00,300
when I tripped on
that darn skateboard.

225
00:16:01,312 --> 00:16:05,248
The bathroom's over there, Jack.
Have you forgotten already?

226
00:16:09,153 --> 00:16:11,144
It's over here?

227
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:14,520
There it is.

228
00:16:15,526 --> 00:16:18,859
Got my bearings back.
Thanks, Ben.

229
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:26,498
- Good night, Mother.
- Good night, sweetheart.

230
00:17:10,281 --> 00:17:13,512
♪ <i>Strumming on the old banjo</i> ♪

231
00:17:13,584 --> 00:17:15,848
And singing'

232
00:17:32,745 --> 00:17:36,545
- What are you doing?
- Oh, morning, Ben.

233
00:17:36,615 --> 00:17:38,605
For some reason, I didn't
sleep well last night.

234
00:17:38,606 --> 00:17:40,107
So I got up early to make breakfast.

235
00:17:40,185 --> 00:17:44,349
Uh, do me a favor. Will you come around
in here and, uh, shut this stove off?

236
00:17:52,564 --> 00:17:54,725
What is all this stuff anyway?

237
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,928
Eggs Benedict a la Sturges, my boy.

238
00:17:58,003 --> 00:18:00,301
Eggs what?

239
00:18:00,372 --> 00:18:03,500
Poached eggs and slice of ham
on English muffins.

240
00:18:03,575 --> 00:18:08,512
Topped off with hollandaise sauce,
most of which is on the counter.

241
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,242
And the a la Sturges part is...

242
00:18:11,316 --> 00:18:13,307
caviar.

243
00:18:13,385 --> 00:18:16,081
Does the word "cholesterol"
mean anything to you, Jack?

244
00:18:16,155 --> 00:18:18,722
Well, I don't eat like
this all the time, Ben.

245
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:20,251
It's sort of a celebration.

246
00:18:20,325 --> 00:18:23,089
And how about the word "recycle"?
I mean, you put the eggshells...

247
00:18:23,162 --> 00:18:26,256
in with the paper instead
of the organic material.

248
00:18:26,331 --> 00:18:30,768
Oh. Oh. I thought you had just
four different garbage cans.

249
00:18:30,836 --> 00:18:33,703
Look, this one is for paper...

250
00:18:33,772 --> 00:18:36,673
this one is for aluminum,
this one is for glass...

251
00:18:36,742 --> 00:18:41,145
and this one is for
the organic materials, like eggshells.

252
00:18:41,213 --> 00:18:44,478
Well, I'll just put the eggshells
over here then. No problem.

253
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,484
Something smells good.

254
00:18:48,387 --> 00:18:51,083
- What happened here?
- I made eggs Benedict.

255
00:18:52,157 --> 00:18:55,251
Jack's trying to kill us
with animal fat.

256
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:03,905
Ben and I usually just
have a little granola,

257
00:19:03,906 --> 00:19:06,162
yogurt, sliced fruit in the morning.

258
00:19:06,238 --> 00:19:10,299
Oh, okay, fine. I'll just dump
this stuff in with the organic material...

259
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:13,469
and whip up some granola
and sliced fruit and some yogurt.

260
00:19:13,545 --> 00:19:16,241
- How's that?
- Don't bother.

261
00:19:16,315 --> 00:19:19,011
I'll just pick up something
on the way to school.

262
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:24,111
- Ben, don't forget to take...
- Good-bye, Mother.

263
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:35,793
Well, I guess we're not getting off
to a very good start, are we?

264
00:19:35,868 --> 00:19:39,099
Ben and I make breakfast
together every morning.

265
00:19:39,171 --> 00:19:41,332
It's one of our routines.

266
00:19:41,406 --> 00:19:45,706
I'll just make a list
so this doesn't happen again.

267
00:19:45,777 --> 00:19:47,836
Good idea.

268
00:20:02,694 --> 00:20:04,685
A lot of help you've been.

269
00:20:06,365 --> 00:20:08,560
Paper only.

270
00:20:17,776 --> 00:20:21,268
- Someone sure is hungry.
- Hey, Monroe, how ya doing'?

271
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:24,406
- Don't they feed you at home?
- I skipped breakfast.

272
00:20:24,483 --> 00:20:28,249
My mom's boyfriend took over the kitchen,
and I walked out in protest.

273
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,881
Well, I could have told you
that was gonna happen. Always does.

274
00:20:31,957 --> 00:20:34,619
First thing they do is take over
the bathroom and the kitchen.

275
00:20:34,693 --> 00:20:36,888
Then the sofa and the TV.

276
00:20:36,962 --> 00:20:40,659
My advice to you is to get rid
of this guy immediately.

277
00:20:40,732 --> 00:20:42,723
It's gonna be pretty hard.

278
00:20:42,801 --> 00:20:46,669
My mom's trapped in this huge love bubble.
She's not thinking clearly.

279
00:20:46,738 --> 00:20:50,697
I'm telling you, man, whatever you do,
you'd better do it soon.

280
00:20:50,776 --> 00:20:54,507
'Cause it's my own personal experience
that the longer a mom lives with a guy...

281
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:57,174
the harder it is to get rid of him.

282
00:20:58,584 --> 00:21:01,280
Hello? Can someone get me
out of here?

283
00:21:04,156 --> 00:21:05,885
Is there somebody in there?

284
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:08,426
Yeah. Can you get me
out of here, please?

285
00:21:08,493 --> 00:21:10,791
- What's the combination?
- Thirty-eight...

286
00:21:10,862 --> 00:21:14,354
24, 36.

287
00:21:19,504 --> 00:21:21,472
Hi.

288
00:21:23,275 --> 00:21:27,268
Thanks. Boy, it's tight in there.

289
00:21:27,346 --> 00:21:30,042
I'm Norman Bronski, by the way.

290
00:21:30,115 --> 00:21:32,345
I'm Ben, and this is Monroe.

291
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:34,408
What were you doing in your locker?

292
00:21:34,486 --> 00:21:37,546
Don't you know you're supposed to be
on the outside when you lock it up?

293
00:21:37,623 --> 00:21:40,820
Some big guys were making fun of me.
They stuffed me in there.

294
00:21:40,892 --> 00:21:43,884
- Does that happen a lot?
- Just about every day.

295
00:21:43,962 --> 00:21:47,762
Well, maybe that dorky-looking Indian
getup has something to do with it.

296
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:50,529
It's got everything to do with it.
I'm an Indian Guide.

297
00:21:50,602 --> 00:21:52,502
What's an Indian Guide?

298
00:21:52,571 --> 00:21:56,837
The YMCA Indian Guides is a program
designed to foster understanding...

299
00:21:56,908 --> 00:21:59,604
and companionship
between father and son.

300
00:21:59,678 --> 00:22:02,010
Well, uh, nice talking
to you there, Cochise.

301
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,071
We gotta be going.

302
00:22:04,149 --> 00:22:05,417
Hey, tell me something, Norm.

303
00:22:05,418 --> 00:22:07,516
Do the fathers have to
dress like Indians too?

304
00:22:07,586 --> 00:22:12,216
Oh, sure. My dad wears this huge headdress
with a lot of feathers on it.

305
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:15,191
Sounds real exciting. Let's go.

306
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:18,161
- And how does one join this club, Norman?
- What?

307
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:20,221
Here's everything you need to know.

308
00:22:20,222 --> 00:22:22,894
We'd be glad for you
and your dad to join us.

309
00:22:22,968 --> 00:22:25,869
Our tribe's always looking
for new members.

310
00:22:25,937 --> 00:22:28,565
Well, I gotta go.

311
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,508
Nice meeting you guys.
If you happen by this way tomorrow...

312
00:22:32,577 --> 00:22:35,842
you might want to check
if I'm stuffed in my locker again.

313
00:22:35,914 --> 00:22:38,348
So long.

314
00:22:38,417 --> 00:22:42,353
Are you crazy? You seriously want
to hang with a goof like that?

315
00:22:42,421 --> 00:22:46,482
Of course not. The whole thing
is strictly Twilight Zone.

316
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:50,085
But this Indian Guide thing
could be the solution to my problem.

317
00:22:50,162 --> 00:22:51,720
I don't get it.

318
00:22:57,903 --> 00:22:59,491
Are you sure he wants to do this?

319
00:22:59,492 --> 00:23:01,896
It says here they actually
eat nuts and berries.

320
00:23:01,973 --> 00:23:04,032
Doesn't he get enough
of that for breakfast?

321
00:23:04,109 --> 00:23:07,875
What? I didn't hear you.

322
00:23:07,946 --> 00:23:10,744
Did Ben say why he wants us
to do this Indian Guide thing?

323
00:23:10,816 --> 00:23:12,254
He said he thought it'd be a good way

324
00:23:12,255 --> 00:23:14,081
for the two of you to
get to know each other.

325
00:23:14,152 --> 00:23:16,586
But, Sandy,
these people sit around...

326
00:23:16,655 --> 00:23:20,056
making things like furry
refrigerator magnets.

327
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:22,487
I mean, what tribe of
Indians in all of history

328
00:23:22,488 --> 00:23:24,357
ever made furry refrigerator magnets?

329
00:23:24,429 --> 00:23:28,058
I think the fact that Ben wants
to spend time with you...

330
00:23:28,133 --> 00:23:30,693
that's a good sign, don't you?

331
00:23:30,769 --> 00:23:32,862
Yes, I do.

332
00:23:32,938 --> 00:23:35,566
But why can't he wanna do something
a little bit more normal?

333
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:40,236
- Like, uh, joining Little League.
- Because you know how kids are.

334
00:23:40,312 --> 00:23:42,303
This week, they're excited
about Indian Guides.

335
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:45,611
Next week, they're excited
about roller hockey.

336
00:23:45,684 --> 00:23:48,744
Just give it a try.
I mean, how bad can it be?

337
00:23:50,489 --> 00:23:53,686

- All right.
- Yeah!

346
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:19,843
Excellent. Excellent.

347
00:24:19,918 --> 00:24:23,479
Now, as chief of the Minotauk,
it's my very special pleasure tonight...

348
00:24:23,555 --> 00:24:25,921
to welcome two new members
into the tribe.

349
00:24:25,991 --> 00:24:30,826
So let's hear a very special
Guide welcome for Jack and Ben.

350
00:24:32,097 --> 00:24:34,361
- Welcome! Welcome!
- All right!

351
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:37,731
- All right!
- ♪ <i>Hey-ha-ea-ya, Ben</i>♪

352
00:24:37,803 --> 00:24:39,794
♪ <i>Hey-ha-ea-ya, Jack</i> ♪

353
00:24:41,406 --> 00:24:43,397
♪ <i>Fine, thanks
How are you</i> ♪

354
00:24:43,475 --> 00:24:47,002
No, no, Jack. "Hey-ha-ea-ya" is
the official greeting of the Minotauk.

355
00:24:47,078 --> 00:24:48,331
Oh.

356
00:24:48,332 --> 00:24:51,148
Yeah. It's just our way of
saying, "Welcome. Have a good time."

357
00:24:51,149 --> 00:24:54,641
- "You're among friends."
- I f-feel comfortable already.

358
00:24:54,719 --> 00:24:56,521
Now that's good because
the whole point...

359
00:24:56,522 --> 00:24:58,692
is to just relax and
have a whole lot of fun.

360
00:24:58,826 --> 00:25:00,794
Right, Guides? All right!

361
00:25:01,795 --> 00:25:04,389
All right. Which is why I'd like
to call upon Silent Thunder...

362
00:25:04,464 --> 00:25:06,864
who's prepared a little entertainment
for tonight's meeting.

363
00:25:06,934 --> 00:25:08,666
Excuse me there,
Chief Running Horse.

364
00:25:08,667 --> 00:25:09,732
- Point of order.
- Yes?

365
00:25:09,803 --> 00:25:12,121
I believe it is customary
at this juncture for...

366
00:25:12,122 --> 00:25:14,069
new members to pick
names for each other.

367
00:25:14,141 --> 00:25:18,578
Yes, of course. Once again, Silver Fox
has nailed the chief on a point of order.

368
00:25:18,645 --> 00:25:20,977
I just believe it's important
to follow the rules...

369
00:25:21,048 --> 00:25:23,539
to set an example
for the youngsters.

370
00:25:23,617 --> 00:25:25,278
Red's our tribal secretary.

371
00:25:25,352 --> 00:25:29,516
He's memorized the entire
Guide manual, word for word.

372
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:31,649
It took me six months.

373
00:25:31,725 --> 00:25:34,319
Really? You must be very proud.

374
00:25:36,296 --> 00:25:39,390
You see, Jack and Ben, fathers and sons
picking Indian names for each other...

375
00:25:39,466 --> 00:25:42,128
is one of the most important
Indian Guide rituals.

376
00:25:42,202 --> 00:25:45,535
For example, I'm Running Horse
and this is my son Dark Eagle.

377
00:25:46,607 --> 00:25:49,872
Oh, I see. They're...
They're all animal names.

378
00:25:49,943 --> 00:25:52,605
Yeah, you got it.
So, you wanna go first?

379
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:55,978
Well, you know, I should warn you,
I'm not very good at this kind of thing.

380
00:25:56,049 --> 00:25:57,641
- I'm not...
- Jack, it's easy.

381
00:25:57,718 --> 00:26:00,915
Yeah, come on, Jack. Give it a shot.
How hard could it be?

382
00:26:00,988 --> 00:26:03,681
I have a, uh, list of
pre-approved Indian names,

383
00:26:03,682 --> 00:26:05,220
if it would be of any help.

384
00:26:05,292 --> 00:26:08,557
Red, Red, I think Jack
can just wing it.

385
00:26:08,629 --> 00:26:11,689
Sure, okay, well, uh,
if I'm, uh, just gonna wing it...

386
00:26:11,765 --> 00:26:15,667
um, how 'bout, um, Little Wing?

387
00:26:15,736 --> 00:26:19,502
Good name. Good song too.
Jimi Hendrix.

388
00:26:19,573 --> 00:26:22,667
I've got the album.
Axis... Bold as Love.

389
00:26:22,743 --> 00:26:28,010
All right, Guides, from now on,
Ben's new tribal name will be Little Wing.

390
00:26:28,716 --> 00:26:29,548
- Yeah!
- All right!

391
00:26:29,616 --> 00:26:32,551
All right.
Fly on, Little Wing, yeah.

392
00:26:32,619 --> 00:26:35,417
Okay, Ben, your turn now.
Pick a name for Jack.

393
00:26:35,489 --> 00:26:38,151
Something that tells us
how you feel about him.

394
00:26:39,593 --> 00:26:43,029
How about Squatting Dog?

395
00:26:44,031 --> 00:26:46,898
Squatting Dog? That's the best
you could come up with?

396
00:26:46,967 --> 00:26:51,131
Well, I had a dog once who had
a terrible case of the squirts.

397
00:26:51,204 --> 00:26:53,399
He was my best friend
in the whole world.

398
00:26:55,342 --> 00:26:57,902
Did you have any other pets?

399
00:26:57,978 --> 00:27:00,412
I had a squirrel named Numbnuts.

400
00:27:03,016 --> 00:27:04,677
Uh, I'm gonna go with Squatting Dog.

401
00:27:04,751 --> 00:27:06,742
Okay. Good name.

402
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:10,221
Funny name. Minotauk appreciate
a sense of humor.

403
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:14,624
All right, Guides, from now on, Jack's new
tribal name will be Squatting Dog.

404
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:18,593
- Way to go!
- Yeah!

405
00:27:18,665 --> 00:27:21,759
Okay, now, Silent Thunder,
the floor is yours.

406
00:27:24,371 --> 00:27:25,530
- All right.
- Yeah!

407
00:27:25,531 --> 00:27:26,968
Go, Dad!

408
00:27:29,376 --> 00:27:32,675
This is gonna be great.
Lloyd's been preparing this all week.

409
00:27:41,154 --> 00:27:43,088
Oh, come on.

410
00:27:53,533 --> 00:27:56,058
- What's going on?
- Oh, I should have told you.

411
00:27:56,136 --> 00:28:00,402
Silent Thunder's a circus performer.
He likes to express himself without words.

412
00:28:00,474 --> 00:28:02,772
- He's pretty good at it, isn't he?
- Whoa.

Bravo! Bravo!

424
00:28:49,322 --> 00:28:51,153
All right!

425
00:28:51,224 --> 00:28:54,057
Very good, Silent Thunder.
Very funny.

426
00:28:54,127 --> 00:28:57,187
All right. Let's keep
the good times rolling, Guides.

427
00:28:57,264 --> 00:28:59,198
Who's up for a game
of scrambled moccasins, huh?

428
00:28:59,266 --> 00:29:02,565
- Point of order there, Chief.
- Yes, Red, what is it now?

429
00:29:02,636 --> 00:29:04,866
I believe we played scrambled moccasins
at last week's meeting.

430
00:29:04,938 --> 00:29:08,169
And since we decided to vary
the games from week to week...

431
00:29:08,241 --> 00:29:12,940
we should be onto either potato bowling
or pass the grapefruit.

432
00:29:13,013 --> 00:29:16,449
Are you sure? I could have sworn
we played scrambled birch bark last week.

433
00:29:16,516 --> 00:29:19,144
No, uh, according to my notes...

434
00:29:19,219 --> 00:29:21,312
uh, we made macaroni name tags.

435
00:29:21,388 --> 00:29:24,448
Silent Thunder served chocolate
corn bread and fruit punch.

436
00:29:24,524 --> 00:29:28,585
Chief Running Horse gave an interesting talk
on why we have nasal hair.

437
00:29:28,662 --> 00:29:31,654
And, uh, yeah, here it is.
Scrambled moccasins.

438
00:29:33,266 --> 00:29:37,999
Okay, then. Guides, a show of feathers.
Who's up for a game of potato bowling?

439
00:29:40,107 --> 00:29:44,237
All right!
Then let's get ready to rumble!

440
00:29:45,011 --> 00:29:47,673
And Jack and Ben,
as new members...

441
00:29:47,747 --> 00:29:50,215
you have the honor
of hurling the first spud.

442
00:29:50,283 --> 00:29:52,274
Yeah!

443
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:01,024
I'm telling you, Monroe,

444
00:30:01,025 --> 00:30:03,893
adults are so easy to
figure out, it's scary.

445
00:30:03,964 --> 00:30:07,024
As soon as I said I liked it,
he said he liked it.

446
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,500
- Yes.
- But he hated it, right?

447
00:30:09,569 --> 00:30:11,537
Oh, totally.
You should have been there.

448
00:30:11,605 --> 00:30:15,234
We all had to play this stupid game
where you roll potatoes along the floor...

449
00:30:15,308 --> 00:30:16,806
to see who could get 'em closest

450
00:30:16,807 --> 00:30:19,005
to a big circle on a
huge piece of newspaper.

451
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:21,104
I don't see how
you can stand it, man.

452
00:30:21,181 --> 00:30:23,877
Well, fortunately, I won't
have to stand it much longer.

453
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:26,475
There's a big, dopey campout
this Saturday night.

454
00:30:26,553 --> 00:30:28,783
We have to sleep outside
in someone's backyard.

455
00:30:29,756 --> 00:30:33,715
I'll never understand why you white people
like to sleep outside on the ground.

456
00:30:33,793 --> 00:30:35,727
You'll never catch
no brothers doing that.

457
00:30:35,795 --> 00:30:38,195
And just in case
that isn't quite bad enough...

458
00:30:38,265 --> 00:30:42,361
I told Jack that all the other fathers
were dressing up like authentic Indians.

459
00:30:42,435 --> 00:30:46,735
So he went out and rented a complete costume
to show me how enthusiastic he is.

460
00:30:46,806 --> 00:30:49,104
Are the other fathers
dressing up like Indians?

461
00:30:49,176 --> 00:30:52,111
- Of course not.
- You're the devil, man.

462
00:30:52,179 --> 00:30:54,579
Yes!

463
00:30:56,683 --> 00:30:59,151
When is the food ready?
I'm hungry.

464
00:30:59,219 --> 00:31:01,744
All right. Juicy burgers coming' up.

465
00:31:01,821 --> 00:31:04,619
Hey, can somebody give me
a hand with this tent?

466
00:31:04,691 --> 00:31:09,060
- Sure, I'll help you.
- Hey, Jack.

467
00:31:09,129 --> 00:31:13,862
Jack, nice costume.
Very authentic.

468
00:31:13,934 --> 00:31:16,596
But we usually don't get dressed up
except for really big special occasions.

469
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:18,604
I probably should've told you.

470
00:31:18,672 --> 00:31:20,264
Well, it's okay. I...

471
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:23,741
I just happened to have this
lying around in my closet anyway. So...

472
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:27,075
Yeah, looks great too.
Listen, I gotta fire up the barbecue.

473
00:31:27,147 --> 00:31:30,583
But, uh, we'll talk later, huh?

474
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:33,346
Hey, Jack, you need to get your face
painted like everybody else.

475
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:36,617
I'm still hungry!
When are we eating?

476
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:38,552
I thought you said all
the other fathers were...

477
00:31:38,553 --> 00:31:40,091
gonna be wearing Indian costumes too.

478
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:43,061
Sorry, I guess I misunderstood.
I hope you're not mad at me.

479
00:31:44,064 --> 00:31:46,760
No. Honest mistake, I guess.

480
00:31:47,901 --> 00:31:51,200
No harm. No foul.

481
00:31:51,271 --> 00:31:54,468
Wait a minute. What-What kind of paint
is that? I-I-I have to be careful.

482
00:31:54,541 --> 00:31:56,748
Uh, it's not really
paint. Just watercolor.

483
00:31:56,749 --> 00:31:57,676
Oh.

484
00:31:57,677 --> 00:31:59,872
That's good, 'cause I have
a tendency to break out.

485
00:31:59,946 --> 00:32:02,107
Don't worry.
I checked the label.

486
00:32:02,182 --> 00:32:03,448
- You did?
- Yeah.

487
00:32:03,449 --> 00:32:04,514
Well, thanks.

488
00:32:04,584 --> 00:32:07,044
- That was very thoughtful of you, Ben.
- No problem.

489
00:32:08,445 --> 00:32:11,107
Hey, everybody,
I got a great idea.

490
00:32:11,182 --> 00:32:13,241
- Let's have a grapefruit relay.
- Yeah!

491
00:32:13,317 --> 00:32:17,253
- How about it, Jack? Are you up for it?
- Oh, yeah, can't wait.

492
00:32:17,321 --> 00:32:21,621
You know, I could probably pop a round
into Sturges's skull from right here.

493
00:32:21,692 --> 00:32:24,559
- From here? With what?
- A 38.

494
00:32:24,628 --> 00:32:28,120
Get away from me with that. A 38
wouldn't even make it across the street.

495
00:32:28,199 --> 00:32:31,293
On the other hand, a 22 super speed
has enough velocity...

496
00:32:31,368 --> 00:32:34,735
to make it through his brain
and into the next county.

497
00:32:34,805 --> 00:32:38,172
I told you guys we gotta
make this look like an accident...

498
00:32:38,242 --> 00:32:41,006
so the whole thing don't
come back on my old man.

499
00:32:41,078 --> 00:32:44,479
Now forget the 38s and the 22s.

500
00:32:44,548 --> 00:32:47,016
Think accidental death.

501
00:32:47,084 --> 00:32:48,745
Understand?

502
00:32:48,819 --> 00:32:52,870
Okay, Guides, all ready
for the big grapefruit relay?

503
00:32:52,871 --> 00:32:53,745
Yeah!

504
00:32:53,746 --> 00:32:57,860
Down to the end of the yard and back again.
And remember, the rule is...

505
00:32:57,861 --> 00:33:01,695
you can't touch your fruit
with your hands.

506
00:33:01,765 --> 00:33:04,996
On your marks. Get set.

507
00:33:05,069 --> 00:33:06,184
- Go!
- Come on!

508
00:33:06,185 --> 00:33:07,299
You can do it!

509
00:33:07,371 --> 00:33:09,896
Listen, Jack, there's something
I wanna talk to you about.

510
00:33:09,974 --> 00:33:12,772
Do you think it could wait till
we don't have grapefruits under our chins?

511
00:33:12,843 --> 00:33:14,902
Yeah, I didn't wanna do it
in front of the others.

512
00:33:14,979 --> 00:33:17,277
See, Norman told me
you're not really Ben's father.

513
00:33:17,348 --> 00:33:19,748
Well, that's true, I'm not.

514
00:33:19,817 --> 00:33:23,719
Geez, I hope that doesn't mean
Ben and I have to leave the Indian Guides.

515
00:33:23,787 --> 00:33:26,813
- No, no, not at all.
- Oh. You're sure about that?

516
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:28,551
- Yeah.
- Maybe you better check with Red first.

517
00:33:28,626 --> 00:33:32,118
What I'm trying to say is, I'm not
Norman's father either. I'm his stepfather.

518
00:33:34,198 --> 00:33:38,259
This thing broke open on me.
I'm starting to get juice down my chest.

519
00:33:38,335 --> 00:33:40,231
- Come on! Get the grapefruit!
- Remember, no hands!

520
00:33:40,537 --> 00:33:43,529
I think I know what
you're going through with Ben.

521
00:33:46,543 --> 00:33:50,980
So, if you ever need
any advice or anything...

522
00:33:51,048 --> 00:33:54,108
I appreciate it.
I really appreciate it.

523
00:33:54,184 --> 00:33:58,052
But I think I'm doing fine
on my own. Really.

524
00:33:58,122 --> 00:34:00,611
Okay, but if you ever
wanna talk, I'm there.

525
00:34:00,612 --> 00:34:02,220
Okay.

526
00:34:10,668 --> 00:34:12,693
Can't get any worse than this.

527
00:34:12,836 --> 00:34:16,237
Your Honor, the US attorney's
appearance here indicates...

528
00:34:16,307 --> 00:34:19,504
a complete lack of respect
by the federal government for our case...

529
00:34:19,576 --> 00:34:21,441
and I move for a mistrial.

530
00:34:21,512 --> 00:34:24,003
Thank you, Mr. Red Crow.
I'll take that under advisement.

531
00:34:24,081 --> 00:34:27,278
Mr. Sturges,
would you care to comment?

532
00:34:27,351 --> 00:34:32,220
Your Honor, I assure you, I meant
absolutely no disrespect to the plaintiff.

533
00:34:32,289 --> 00:34:34,519
Leonard, really, it's just a rash.

534
00:34:34,591 --> 00:34:37,389
It looks a lot like war paint, Jack.

535
00:34:37,461 --> 00:34:41,022
Although, the happy face
is not technically a native symbol.

536
00:34:44,001 --> 00:34:46,128
War paint, Jack?

537
00:34:46,203 --> 00:34:48,485
The Salish Indian tribe
sues the United States...

538
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:50,401
government over
indigenous land rights...

539
00:34:50,474 --> 00:34:52,635
and you show up in war paint?

540
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:56,578
Good God, Jack, this is the '90s.
Haven't you heard of political correctness?

541
00:34:56,647 --> 00:34:58,012
Of course I have.

542
00:34:58,082 --> 00:35:02,018
Look, this Salish thing is
a very sensitive issue for us...

543
00:35:02,086 --> 00:35:04,247
so I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to take you off the case.

544
00:35:04,321 --> 00:35:06,500
Come on, Bob. Isn't
that a little drastic?

545
00:35:06,501 --> 00:35:08,781
I mean, this rash will
go away in 24 hours.

546
00:35:08,859 --> 00:35:12,488
- I can get a continuance.
- It's not just the rash.

547
00:35:12,563 --> 00:35:17,432
It's your behavior in general.
You've canceled meetings. You're unprepared.

548
00:35:17,501 --> 00:35:20,299
I'm sorry, Bob.
I explained that to you.

549
00:35:20,371 --> 00:35:23,863
Yeah, I know, I know. The, uh...
The Indian thing with the stepson.

550
00:35:25,209 --> 00:35:27,734
It's taken up a lot more of my time
than I thought it would.

551
00:35:27,811 --> 00:35:31,747
I can understand,
and I can sympathize.

552
00:35:31,815 --> 00:35:34,978
But frankly, I don't care!

553
00:35:35,052 --> 00:35:38,180
We have an important job
to do here, Jack.

554
00:35:38,255 --> 00:35:43,249
I suggest you get your priorities in order.
Am I making myself understood?

555
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:49,824
I've been working with
the US attorney's office 15 years.

556
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:53,859
And I've never been taken off
a case till this morning.

557
00:35:53,937 --> 00:35:56,397
I'm sorry. I did my best.
But this whole Indian

558
00:35:56,398 --> 00:35:58,499
Guide thing is just... just not working.

559
00:35:58,575 --> 00:36:00,566
Couldn't you just give it
another chance?

560
00:36:02,312 --> 00:36:06,408
I can't do it, Sandy.
It's interfering with my work.

561
00:36:06,483 --> 00:36:10,977
I mean, I can either be a United States
attorney or an Indian Guide's father.

562
00:36:11,054 --> 00:36:15,218
I can't be both.
You do see my point, don't you?

563
00:36:15,292 --> 00:36:17,055
I suppose so.

564
00:36:17,127 --> 00:36:19,288
I just don't know how
I'm gonna tell Ben.

565
00:36:19,363 --> 00:36:22,821
Nobody has to tell me anything.
I heard the whole thing.

566
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,868
You know, I knew
this was gonna happen.

567
00:36:24,935 --> 00:36:28,302
Just when I was beginning to have fun
and make new friends, he wants to quit.

568
00:36:28,372 --> 00:36:31,177
Look, sweetheart, there's
lots of other things

569
00:36:31,178 --> 00:36:32,968
you and Jack can do together.

570
00:36:33,043 --> 00:36:35,511
Sure, we can go
to baseball games, movies.

571
00:36:35,579 --> 00:36:38,946
Yeah, right, until you get
tired of them and quit.

572
00:36:39,016 --> 00:36:41,712
I told you he was gonna
be just like dad.

573
00:36:46,256 --> 00:36:49,316
I was afraid something
like this was gonna happen.

574
00:36:49,393 --> 00:36:52,226
Don't you think
he's overreacting a little?

575
00:36:52,296 --> 00:36:54,560
I mean, this is just about
the stupid Indian Guides.

576
00:36:54,631 --> 00:36:57,759
No, Jack, it's not just about
the stupid Indian Guides.

577
00:36:57,835 --> 00:37:00,565
I told you this was gonna be
a difficult adjustment for Ben to make.

578
00:37:00,637 --> 00:37:03,330
You said, "Oh, no, don't
worry. I'm an expert."

579
00:37:03,331 --> 00:37:05,631
I've got all the books on the subject."

580
00:37:05,709 --> 00:37:08,439
I'm doing the best I can.

581
00:37:08,512 --> 00:37:11,242
Well, it doesn't seem
to be good enough, does it?

582
00:37:15,018 --> 00:37:18,852
- Now what's that supposed to mean?
- It means...

583
00:37:21,091 --> 00:37:23,559
It means...

584
00:37:23,627 --> 00:37:27,529
I don't know.
Maybe I made a mistake.

585
00:37:27,598 --> 00:37:30,089
Maybe this is all
happening to soon.

586
00:37:30,167 --> 00:37:34,661
Maybe I should wait until Ben is older
and able to handle this better.

587
00:37:36,139 --> 00:37:39,370
Maybe we'd all be able
to handle it better.

588
00:38:06,303 --> 00:38:08,252
You really think you made a mistake?

589
00:38:08,253 --> 00:38:10,797
'Cause if you do, I'll
move back to my place.

590
00:38:12,676 --> 00:38:14,735
I just wanted everything
to work out.

591
00:38:14,811 --> 00:38:18,679
I want the three of us
to become a family.

592
00:38:26,857 --> 00:38:30,122
Well, I want that too.

593
00:38:30,193 --> 00:38:32,218
So, I guess I'll just have
to rearrange my schedule...

594
00:38:32,296 --> 00:38:37,063
so that I can be a US attorney
and an Indian Guide father.

595
00:38:39,169 --> 00:38:41,103
Are you sure?

596
00:38:43,707 --> 00:38:45,732
If Chet Bronski and Red Sweeney...

597
00:38:45,809 --> 00:38:49,438
and that circus guy
can do it, I can do it.

598
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:56,508
I better go upstairs and apologize
and eat a little you know what.

599
00:39:04,194 --> 00:39:08,130
I did it, Monroe. I did it!
I think I broke the love bubble.

600
00:39:08,198 --> 00:39:09,995
Yeah, and not a minute too soon.

601
00:39:10,067 --> 00:39:13,901
I don't know how much longer I could've
put up with those Indian geeks.

602
00:39:13,971 --> 00:39:17,566
Yeah, he quit. And then
I went into my "upset child" act.

603
00:39:17,641 --> 00:39:20,151
They started to fight,
and she told him she was...

604
00:39:20,152 --> 00:39:22,908
gonna wait till I'm older
and better able to handle it.

605
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:27,440
Yeah, the guy's history. I figure
he'll be back in Tacoma by tomorrow.

606
00:39:40,297 --> 00:39:42,697
- Did you speak to him?
- What?

607
00:39:42,766 --> 00:39:46,862
- Did you speak to him?
- Oh, no.

608
00:39:46,937 --> 00:39:49,098
He was on the phone.

609
00:39:49,172 --> 00:39:53,336
I've got a lot of work to do anyway.
I'll talk to him in the morning.

610
00:40:43,327 --> 00:40:45,090
Chet.

611
00:40:45,162 --> 00:40:47,562
- Sorry. Did I scare you?
- Jack.

612
00:40:47,631 --> 00:40:50,429
Oh, I'm sorry. You know, they told me
in the office you'd be down here.

613
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,968
- Yeah, well, this is my classroom.
- Uh-huh.

614
00:40:53,036 --> 00:40:54,970
Fifteen years now.

615
00:40:57,174 --> 00:40:59,665
Adrenaline.

616
00:40:59,743 --> 00:41:03,406
So what brings you around?
Wanna make a spice rack for your mom?

617
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:06,278
Oh, no, no, no.

618
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:09,786
No, no, the thing
of it is, I, uh...

619
00:41:09,853 --> 00:41:12,413
Well, you know, I drive... I drive by here
every morning on my way to work.

620
00:41:12,489 --> 00:41:15,390
And, uh, well, I thought maybe,
you know...

621
00:41:15,459 --> 00:41:18,860
You know, I-I just thought
I might, uh, drop by...

622
00:41:18,929 --> 00:41:22,160
Say, this... this is nice.
What is it?

623
00:41:22,232 --> 00:41:24,826
That's what we like
to call a hammer, Jack.

624
00:41:24,901 --> 00:41:27,301
Oh, of course.

625
00:41:27,371 --> 00:41:31,432
Tell me, Jack. Does it take you this long
to get to the point in court?

626
00:41:31,508 --> 00:41:35,342
Actually, addressing a jury is a lot easier
than what I came here to do.

627
00:41:35,412 --> 00:41:38,347
I need to ask your advice
on something.

628
00:41:38,415 --> 00:41:42,215
It's amazing how difficult it is for us guys
to ask each other for anything, isn't it?

629
00:41:42,285 --> 00:41:44,685
- You got that right.
- But that's okay.

630
00:41:44,755 --> 00:41:47,690
- We're all members of the same tribe.
- Yeah, the Minotauk.

631
00:41:47,758 --> 00:41:51,558
No, I mean the emotionally
constipated American male over 40.

632
00:41:51,628 --> 00:41:53,994
Now what can I help you with, Jack?

633
00:41:54,064 --> 00:41:55,463
Well, it's Ben.

634
00:41:55,532 --> 00:41:57,882
He's, uh, been doing
everything he can to get...

635
00:41:57,883 --> 00:42:00,231
rid of me. Frankly, I
think he hates my guts.

636
00:42:01,271 --> 00:42:04,536
No, he doesn't hate your guts.

637
00:42:04,608 --> 00:42:06,599
He's just scared.

638
00:42:06,676 --> 00:42:10,009
Scared you're gonna take away
the most important thing in his life...

639
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,014
his mom.

640
00:42:14,117 --> 00:42:16,108
Norman did the very same thing to me.

641
00:42:16,186 --> 00:42:18,518
Tried to get rid of me for months.

642
00:42:18,588 --> 00:42:19,990
Well, what...
what did you do?

643
00:42:19,991 --> 00:42:22,888
I mean, you and Norman seem to
have a great relationship now.

644
00:42:22,959 --> 00:42:26,554
Well, I just kept at it,
and at it and at it.

645
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:29,463
That's where the Indian Guides came in.
Helped a lot, actually.

646
00:42:29,533 --> 00:42:33,765
- Indian Guides helped? How?
- By leveling the playing field.

647
00:42:33,837 --> 00:42:36,351
See, one of the best ways
to reach a kid is to...

648
00:42:36,352 --> 00:42:38,865
not be afraid to be a kid
yourself now and again.

649
00:42:38,942 --> 00:42:41,001
It's just that I thought
it'd be a lot easier than this.

650
00:42:41,077 --> 00:42:45,377
Oh, Jack, raising kids is one
of the most difficult things in the world.

651
00:42:45,449 --> 00:42:48,179
But in the end, it's worth it.
Believe me.

652
00:42:51,421 --> 00:42:54,015
You know, Chet, it's funny.

653
00:42:54,090 --> 00:42:57,059
I can stand up to some
of the toughest hoods in the country.

654
00:42:57,127 --> 00:42:59,687
Doesn't phase me a bit.

655
00:42:59,763 --> 00:43:03,563
But an 11-year-old kid,
that's really scary.

656
00:43:03,633 --> 00:43:06,261
Yeah, welcome to the club, Jack.

657
00:43:06,336 --> 00:43:08,031
Thanks, Chet.

Ben, Ben, one of the great men.
We've been waiting for you.

665
00:43:34,064 --> 00:43:36,241
What's going on? What
are you doing here?

666
00:43:36,242 --> 00:43:37,693
I thought you were leaving.

667
00:43:37,767 --> 00:43:39,928
Why would I leave?
I live here.

668
00:43:40,003 --> 00:43:42,528
Jack's decided not to quit
the Indian Guides after all.

669
00:43:42,606 --> 00:43:45,097
- Isn't that wonderful?
- You're kidding.

670
00:43:45,175 --> 00:43:49,578
Absolutely not. And to prove it,
I'd like you to meet someone.

671
00:43:49,646 --> 00:43:54,845
Ben, this is Leonard Red Crow.
Leonard, meet Ben.

672
00:43:57,521 --> 00:43:59,489
How.

673
00:43:59,556 --> 00:44:01,922
Excuse me, did you just say "how"?

674
00:44:03,059 --> 00:44:07,587
Just kidding. I always like to say that.
It makes people laugh.

675
00:44:07,664 --> 00:44:10,030
Leonard's the chief
of the Salish Indian tribe.

676
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:12,226
I've asked him to help
make the Minotauk...

677
00:44:12,227 --> 00:44:14,594
the best tribe in the
whole Indian Guide nation.

678
00:44:14,671 --> 00:44:17,333
- What do you think of that?
- Great.

679
00:44:17,407 --> 00:44:18,682
I knew you'd be thrilled.

680
00:44:18,683 --> 00:44:21,138
The teachings of values
and skills to children...

681
00:44:21,211 --> 00:44:24,374
has always been a very
important part of Indian life.

682
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:27,780
Besides, I can use the beads
and trinkets Jack offered me.

683
00:44:29,953 --> 00:44:31,921
I'm just kidding again.

684
00:44:31,988 --> 00:44:34,479
You know, Ben, you're gonna
have to learn to loosen up.

685
00:44:36,059 --> 00:44:38,892
Leonard's gonna teach us
how to do a real rain dance.

686
00:44:38,962 --> 00:44:42,989
A rain dance? This is Seattle.
What's the point of that?

687
00:44:43,066 --> 00:44:45,261
Who do you think's responsible
for all the rain?

Ben, Hard Copy's on.

747
00:48:23,431 --> 00:48:25,991
Ben, you awake?

748
00:48:26,534 --> 00:48:28,866
I guess he's not coming.

749
00:48:30,504 --> 00:48:32,802
He's exhausted.

750
00:48:32,873 --> 00:48:34,807
I don't blame him.
I'm tired too.

751
00:48:34,875 --> 00:48:37,844
- Yeah, you should get to bed early tonight.
- Yeah.

752
00:48:37,912 --> 00:48:39,937
In fact, um...

753
00:48:44,318 --> 00:48:47,219
In fact, we can go to bed right now.

754
00:48:47,288 --> 00:48:50,280
Oh, I can't. I have
so much work to do. Honey...

755
00:48:50,357 --> 00:48:54,350
- We haven't been alone in such a long time.
- Oh, Sandy.

756
00:48:54,428 --> 00:48:57,693
I promise it won't take more
than a couple of hours.

757
00:48:57,765 --> 00:49:01,166
Okay. I'll be right back.

758
00:49:31,065 --> 00:49:33,465
Come on, Jack.
Do I have to?

759
00:49:33,534 --> 00:49:37,903
- But I thought you liked Norm.
- Well, yeah, he's okay, I guess.

760
00:49:37,972 --> 00:49:39,633
So what's the problem?

761
00:49:39,707 --> 00:49:41,902
Well, seeing him
for Indian Guides is one thing...

762
00:49:41,976 --> 00:49:45,309
but having him sleep over at my house
is something completely different.

763
00:49:45,379 --> 00:49:49,839
Look, Norm's dad told me
he doesn't have a lot of friends...

764
00:49:49,917 --> 00:49:51,942
and I thought this would be
kind of a nice gesture.

765
00:49:52,019 --> 00:49:53,850
So do me this one favor, okay?

766
00:49:53,921 --> 00:49:58,017
Well, hanging out with a guy like that
won't do much for my reputation, you know?

767
00:49:58,092 --> 00:50:02,290
Yeah, we wouldn't want it
getting around what a nice guy you are.

768
00:50:02,363 --> 00:50:05,059
All right. I'll do it.

769
00:50:05,132 --> 00:50:07,862
But just this once, okay?

770
00:50:07,935 --> 00:50:10,836
Good. And to make it really special...

771
00:50:10,905 --> 00:50:13,772
I even got you guys
an authentic Indian tepee.

772
00:50:13,841 --> 00:50:16,309
Chet's setting it up this afternoon.

773
00:50:16,377 --> 00:50:19,210
He's gonna set up a tepee? Where?

774
00:50:35,963 --> 00:50:39,421
It was real nice of you
to invite me to sleep over, Ben.

775
00:50:40,034 --> 00:50:43,026
Yeah, sure.
No sweat. Glad to do it.

776
00:50:43,103 --> 00:50:47,164
'Cause this is the first time I've ever been
invited to sleep over at someone's house.

777
00:50:47,241 --> 00:50:50,233
It's no big deal, Norm.
Don't worry about it.

778
00:50:56,917 --> 00:50:59,351
I brought you something.

779
00:51:02,356 --> 00:51:04,620
This is for me?

780
00:51:05,893 --> 00:51:08,123
It must've cost you a fortune.

781
00:51:08,195 --> 00:51:10,561
Not really.
I made it myself.

782
00:51:12,099 --> 00:51:14,226
All this beadwork
must've taken forever.

783
00:51:15,636 --> 00:51:17,729
Well...

784
00:51:17,805 --> 00:51:20,968
I haven't much else
to do with my time...

785
00:51:21,041 --> 00:51:23,305
and I thought you might
want to have it.

786
00:51:24,645 --> 00:51:27,580
I gotta be honest with you, Norm.

787
00:51:27,648 --> 00:51:31,414
I don't really understand
why you'd do something like this.

788
00:51:31,485 --> 00:51:33,612
Because I wanted to.

789
00:51:33,687 --> 00:51:36,952
And because we're all part of
the same tribe and everything.

790
00:51:37,024 --> 00:51:41,120
If you don't like it, you can tell me.
My feelings won't get hurt.

791
00:51:45,466 --> 00:51:48,492
I like it very much, Norm.

792
00:51:48,569 --> 00:51:51,299
Thanks.

793
00:51:52,406 --> 00:51:54,966
You know what?
I got an idea.

794
00:51:55,042 --> 00:51:57,306
You wanna go down to my room
and play some video games?

795
00:51:57,378 --> 00:52:00,404
- Would I ever!
- Let's do it.

796
00:52:00,481 --> 00:52:04,076
I just got the new
Sub humanoid Slaughterhouse 5000.

797
00:52:04,151 --> 00:52:07,678
- It's really cool, but it's hard.
- I didn't know that had come out yet.

798
00:52:07,755 --> 00:52:11,054
I'm still playing on the
Sub humanoid Slaughterhouse 2000.

799
00:52:11,125 --> 00:52:14,151
2000's for wimps.
5000's way better.

800
00:52:14,228 --> 00:52:16,696
When you kill Gakmo,
the sub humanoid commander...

801
00:52:16,764 --> 00:52:18,959
his head explodes like a gigantic zit.

802
00:52:19,033 --> 00:52:20,830
Cool!

803
00:52:20,901 --> 00:52:23,392
But you gotta watch out
for Douglas the Vampire Troll.

804
00:52:23,470 --> 00:52:27,463
He's got these hyper-speed plasma rockets
that'll melt all your skin right off.

805
00:52:27,541 --> 00:52:30,635
- Way gross!
- It's the best.

806
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:41,811
Hey, Monroe.

807
00:52:43,791 --> 00:52:48,728
- What are you wearing?
- It's an Indian vest. What's it look like?

808
00:52:48,796 --> 00:52:53,290
It looks like Gakmo the Sub humanoid's
head exploded all over your shirt.

809
00:52:53,367 --> 00:52:55,164
What are those things all over it?

810
00:52:55,235 --> 00:52:57,999
These happen to be
authentic Indian beads, Monroe.

811
00:52:58,072 --> 00:53:02,236
Don't you think you're getting
a little heavy with this Indian thing?

812
00:53:02,810 --> 00:53:06,041
You know, I knew you
were gonna get on my case.

813
00:53:06,113 --> 00:53:08,911
But you know what?
It's not as bad as we thought.

814
00:53:08,983 --> 00:53:11,213
I've learned a lot of cool stuff.

815
00:53:11,285 --> 00:53:15,551
For example, do you know how to shoot
a bow and arrow or throw a tomahawk?

816
00:53:15,622 --> 00:53:18,216
- No.
- Well, I do.

817
00:53:18,292 --> 00:53:22,319
That should come in real handy
the next time you go buffalo hunting.

818
00:53:22,396 --> 00:53:24,796
And next weekend
we're going on a canoe trip.

819
00:53:24,865 --> 00:53:28,596
We're gonna go over white-water
rapids and everything. It's gonna be great.

820
00:53:28,669 --> 00:53:31,001
Gee, sorry I can't come.

821
00:53:31,071 --> 00:53:34,404
- Nice Indian beads, buddy.
- What's with the vest?

822
00:53:34,475 --> 00:53:38,343
- I don't want him. You take him.
- Can I join your Indian club too, please?

823
00:53:38,412 --> 00:53:42,781
Looks like chingach-dork
is getting shoved into his locker again.

824
00:53:42,850 --> 00:53:45,216
See what dressing up
like an Indian gets ya?

825
00:53:47,788 --> 00:53:50,120
Hey, wh-where you goin'?

826
00:53:50,190 --> 00:53:52,681
I'm gonna help him out.

827
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:56,696
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

828
00:53:56,764 --> 00:54:01,030
- Talkin' to us, punk?
- I can't watch this.

829
00:54:01,101 --> 00:54:05,060
Let him go or face the consequences.

830
00:54:18,485 --> 00:54:21,477
Sorry about that, Norm,
but I thought it'd work.

831
00:54:21,555 --> 00:54:24,820
That's okay, Ben.
I appreciate the effort.

832
00:54:24,892 --> 00:54:28,589
You know, it's not so bad in here.
It's kind of peaceful.

833
00:54:28,662 --> 00:54:33,156
Yeah, it's amazing
how you get used to it after a while.

834
00:54:33,233 --> 00:54:36,760
Hello? Anybody out there?

835
00:54:36,837 --> 00:54:39,704
Can someone please help us?

836
00:54:39,773 --> 00:54:41,673
Hello.

837
00:54:57,558 --> 00:55:00,013
All right, guys. We ready
for the big canoe trip?

838
00:55:00,014 --> 00:55:00,677
Yeah!

839
00:55:00,678 --> 00:55:03,018
We're gonna go over a lot
of white-water rapids.

840
00:55:03,019 --> 00:55:03,362
Yeah!

841
00:55:03,430 --> 00:55:05,295
- Some of us might fall out.
- Yeah!

842
00:55:05,365 --> 00:55:08,994
- Be torn to bits by a man-eating salmon.
- Yeah!

843
00:55:09,069 --> 00:55:11,264
All right. As soon as Jack gets here,
we're vapor.

844
00:55:11,338 --> 00:55:12,771
Yeah!

845
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:15,968
So, Ben, did, uh... did Jack mention
when he's gonna, uh, be here?

846
00:55:16,043 --> 00:55:18,477
Well, he said he had to finish
some work at the office...

847
00:55:18,545 --> 00:55:20,672
but he promised
he'd be here by noon.

848
00:55:20,747 --> 00:55:23,841
Hey, if he promised,
then he'll be here.

849
00:55:29,201 --> 00:55:32,170
Oh, great. I'm gonna be late.
I can't be late!

850
00:55:39,611 --> 00:55:41,340
This is it!

851
00:55:42,914 --> 00:55:45,610
What's going on here?
My brakes are out!

852
00:55:45,684 --> 00:55:49,245
Bye-bye, Sturges.
Have a nice life.

853
00:56:03,401 --> 00:56:05,665
Whoa! Watch it!

854
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:17,715
Oh, no!

855
00:56:30,295 --> 00:56:32,456
No brakes!
Sorry, no brakes!

856
00:56:46,244 --> 00:56:48,769
- Hey, what's happening? Did you see that?
- Hey, come on. Let's go!

857
00:56:48,847 --> 00:56:50,074
There's a truck in the water.

858
00:56:50,075 --> 00:56:51,816
- Hey, come on, Bob. Follow me!
- Move it!

859
00:56:53,318 --> 00:56:55,457
- What happened over here?
- Come on, buddy! Move it!

860
00:56:55,458 --> 00:56:56,685
Come on.
Get out of the way.

861
00:56:56,755 --> 00:56:59,952
- Watch it!
- Throw the line!

862
00:57:00,025 --> 00:57:02,186
- There he is!
- Somebody call 911.

863
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:03,227
I don't believe it!

864
00:57:03,228 --> 00:57:06,128
I cut those brake lines clean.
He should be dead right now.

865
00:57:06,197 --> 00:57:09,928
It's all right. Don't worry about it.
It was an unlucky break. That's all.

866
00:57:10,001 --> 00:57:12,561
- We'll get another chance.
- I don't care, man.

867
00:57:12,637 --> 00:57:15,629
Come on. Let's get outta here
before somebody sees us.

868
00:57:18,576 --> 00:57:21,101
- Over here. Over here.
- Hit it over here.

869
00:57:21,179 --> 00:57:23,605
- Right here.
- Over here. Over here.

870
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:24,945
Come on. Serve it.

871
00:57:28,219 --> 00:57:32,588
It's already 12:47. I think we should
get going there, Chet. Time's a-wasting.

872
00:57:32,657 --> 00:57:36,149
I was sure Jack would be here by now.
I wonder what happened.

873
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:43,559
Yeah, you're right.
Poor Ben.

874
00:57:43,635 --> 00:57:44,852
- Whoa.
- Hit it.

875
00:57:44,853 --> 00:57:45,933
There you go.

876
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:47,972
Someone's gonna have to tell him.

877
00:57:48,039 --> 00:57:50,735
Either one of you guys wanna do it?

878
00:57:53,678 --> 00:57:58,081
Cowards. Okay, Guides, time to go.
Let's load up.

879
00:57:58,149 --> 00:58:01,641
- All right. Let's go, guys.
- Yes!

880
00:58:03,054 --> 00:58:06,512
Listen, Ben. Uh, Red won't let us wait
any longer for Jack.

881
00:58:08,326 --> 00:58:11,762
Oh, uh, sure, Mr. Bronski.
I understand.

882
00:58:13,398 --> 00:58:17,664
You know, Jack has a very important job.
It's not like me or Lloyd or Red.

883
00:58:17,736 --> 00:58:20,864
So I'm sure whatever's keeping him
has gotta be pretty important too.

884
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:23,501
Yeah.

885
00:58:25,977 --> 00:58:28,241
Hey, you wanna come along with us? Huh?

886
00:58:28,313 --> 00:58:31,009
You can sit in the middle. Norm and I
will take care of all the paddling.

887
00:58:31,082 --> 00:58:34,210
- How would that be?
- No, thanks, Mr. Bronski.

888
00:58:34,285 --> 00:58:36,253
I don't feel much like going anyway.

889
00:58:37,522 --> 00:58:40,184
- You sure?
- Absolutely.

890
00:58:40,258 --> 00:58:42,590
You guys go ahead
and have a great time.

891
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:45,993
- I'll be okay.
- Yeah.

892
00:58:51,136 --> 00:58:53,661
Hey, Ben.

893
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:47,748
Hi, honey. What are you doing back so early?
Where's Jack?

894
00:59:47,826 --> 00:59:49,817
He didn't show up.

895
00:59:51,029 --> 00:59:54,021
What do you mean he didn't show up?
What happened?

896
00:59:54,099 --> 00:59:57,500
Well, he promised he'd be there,
but he never showed up.

897
00:59:57,569 --> 01:00:00,902
So the other guys
went on without me.

898
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:05,204
Oh, baby, I'm so sorry.
I'm sure there's an explanation.

899
01:00:05,276 --> 01:00:07,972
He just found something
better to do. That's all.

900
01:00:08,046 --> 01:00:11,413
No, I know Jack.
He wouldn't do anything like that.

901
01:00:13,551 --> 01:00:16,452
Just like you knew Dad
wouldn't do anything like that?

902
01:00:30,602 --> 01:00:32,763
Oh, my God!
What happened to you?

903
01:00:32,837 --> 01:00:36,568
I got caught in a sudden downpour
and really got soaked.

904
01:00:36,641 --> 01:00:38,472
When was it raining?

905
01:00:38,543 --> 01:00:42,536
It's, uh, kind of complicated. I'll tell you
about it later. I need to talk to Ben first.

906
01:00:42,614 --> 01:00:45,947
- I'll get you a towel.
- Thanks.

907
01:00:56,661 --> 01:01:00,256
I'm really sorry
I missed the canoe trip, Ben.

908
01:01:00,331 --> 01:01:04,461
I had car trouble,
and I just couldn't make it.

909
01:01:07,372 --> 01:01:09,567
Don't worry about it.

910
01:01:12,810 --> 01:01:17,304
I wanted to be there, Ben.
I really did.

911
01:01:29,794 --> 01:01:32,354
Could you get out of the chair
with your wet clothes, please?

912
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:34,728
Sorry.

913
01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:36,858
He's really taking this hard.

914
01:01:36,935 --> 01:01:39,631
Well, he was really
looking forward to this trip...

915
01:01:39,704 --> 01:01:42,104
and he was counting
on you to be there.

916
01:01:42,173 --> 01:01:44,971
Believe me,
what happened was unavoidable.

917
01:01:46,044 --> 01:01:47,909
I'm sure it was.

918
01:01:47,979 --> 01:01:51,471
But without meaning to,
you broke a promise to him...

919
01:01:51,549 --> 01:01:54,985
which, unfortunately, is something
his father used to do to him all the time.

920
01:01:58,790 --> 01:02:02,021
I guess I have to pay for all the mistakes
his father made, don't I?

921
01:02:02,093 --> 01:02:03,890
I'm afraid it goes
with the territory.

922
01:02:06,798 --> 01:02:11,132
- I'll go talk to him.
- No, wait a minute. I'll do it.

923
01:02:16,374 --> 01:02:18,308
Ben, talk to you for a sec?

924
01:02:18,376 --> 01:02:21,675
Yeah, sure.
Do what you want.

925
01:02:22,580 --> 01:02:26,983
Look, Ben. I know you're mad at me,
and I know there's no reason in the world...

926
01:02:27,051 --> 01:02:30,418
for you to believe me,
but I'm gonna make this up to you.

927
01:02:30,488 --> 01:02:33,218
I swear.

928
01:02:33,891 --> 01:02:37,987
Hey, you know the Fourth of July
camping trip that's coming up?

929
01:02:38,062 --> 01:02:41,725
- Yeah, what about it?
- Well, I give you my word...

930
01:02:41,799 --> 01:02:43,733
nothing's gonna interfere with it.

931
01:02:43,801 --> 01:02:46,895
We're gonna go and we're gonna have
the best time we've ever had.

932
01:02:46,971 --> 01:02:49,371
Okay? I promise.

933
01:02:50,041 --> 01:02:51,702
Yeah, sure.

934
01:02:51,776 --> 01:02:53,937
Okay. Good.

935
01:03:16,415 --> 01:03:18,508
It looks like your hunch
was right, Jack.

936
01:03:18,584 --> 01:03:20,484
That was no accident you had.

937
01:03:20,552 --> 01:03:24,215
According to the police report,
the brake lines on your car were cut.

938
01:03:24,290 --> 01:03:27,851
Looks like somebody wants you dead.
I think it would be a good idea...

939
01:03:27,926 --> 01:03:30,952
if we transferred you
to the Portland office for a while.

940
01:03:31,030 --> 01:03:32,287
Portland?

941
01:03:32,288 --> 01:03:34,699
Just until we can find out
who's behind this thing.

942
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:36,895
I'll put the federal marshals
on it right away.

943
01:03:36,969 --> 01:03:39,870
We should have it wrapped up
end of July at the latest.

944
01:03:39,938 --> 01:03:43,840
End of July?
Forget it, Bob. Can't do it.

945
01:03:43,909 --> 01:03:46,207
- Excuse me.
- Can't do it, Bob.

946
01:03:46,278 --> 01:03:48,678
What do you mean you can't do it?

947
01:03:48,747 --> 01:03:51,477
This isn't a negotiation.
It's an order.

948
01:03:51,550 --> 01:03:53,541
Well, then...

949
01:03:55,187 --> 01:03:57,587
you can fire me or I'll quit.

950
01:03:59,091 --> 01:04:01,389
Either way,
I'm not going to Portland.

951
01:04:01,460 --> 01:04:04,258
Got something more important to do.
Sorry, Bob.

952
01:04:04,330 --> 01:04:07,731
Mind telling me what's more
important than staying alive?

953
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:11,793
Right now, a camping trip with Ben.

954
01:04:19,611 --> 01:04:22,671
- Hey, Chet, how about a sing-along?
- Great idea. What do you wanna sing?

955
01:04:22,748 --> 01:04:24,875
I don't know.
How about "Louie, Louie"?

956
01:04:24,950 --> 01:04:28,181
Point of order there, Jack.
I believe that's "Louie, Lou-I."

957
01:04:28,253 --> 01:04:30,721
And I don't think the boys would
know the lyrics to that one.

958
01:04:30,789 --> 01:04:33,952
Well, that's the great thing about
that song, Red. Nobody knows the lyrics.

959
01:04:34,026 --> 01:04:37,553
You can mumble anything you want
and still sound fine.

960
01:04:37,629 --> 01:04:40,189
Who needs words anyway?
Right, Dad?

961
01:04:41,633 --> 01:04:43,624
What do you say, Chet?
Take it.

962
01:04:47,673 --> 01:04:51,507
♪ Oh, Louie, Louie
Oh, no, no ♪

963
01:04:55,547 --> 01:04:59,176

Geez, Ben, there's a lot of stuff here.
Sure glad it's a single.

973
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:37,684
Can you imagine trying to put up
a two-bedroom tepee?

974
01:05:37,756 --> 01:05:40,657
No, I can't,
but that's a really funny concept.

975
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:45,093
Uh, Ben, that was my subtle way
of asking for help.

976
01:05:45,664 --> 01:05:47,962
Well, you'll have to be
more obvious, Jack.

977
01:05:48,033 --> 01:05:51,594
I'm just a kid.
I don't get subtleties.

978
01:05:51,670 --> 01:05:54,571
Okay, fine.
Wanna give me a hand?

979
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:56,938
No, I'd rather not.
My back's sore.

980
01:05:57,810 --> 01:05:59,801
All right.

981
01:05:59,878 --> 01:06:01,903
I'll ask somebody else, then, for help.

982
01:06:05,551 --> 01:06:08,019
Hey, Lloyd, can you help me out?

983
01:06:19,898 --> 01:06:22,264
Let's make him laugh.

984
01:06:22,334 --> 01:06:25,326
Okay, we'll have this up in no time.

985
01:06:26,338 --> 01:06:29,068
Lloyd says, "In a New York minute."
Well, let's do it.

986
01:06:30,108 --> 01:06:32,576
Let's go.

987
01:06:32,644 --> 01:06:34,976
I'm all right.
It's okay.

988
01:06:35,047 --> 01:06:37,038
This looks good.

989
01:06:39,117 --> 01:06:41,711
This one's long.
Oh, perfect.

990
01:06:41,787 --> 01:06:43,778
I need these for the...

991
01:06:45,791 --> 01:06:48,123
'Cause we have to put...
We have to cross these, Lloyd.

992
01:06:48,193 --> 01:06:51,094
They should all be the same height,
and then we can just make a cross.

993
01:06:51,163 --> 01:06:53,256
Make sure they're the same height.

994
01:06:58,837 --> 01:07:00,896
Okay, this is good.
We'll just pull it over...

995
01:07:00,973 --> 01:07:04,431
A little bit more of an angle.
Okay, that's good. Right like that.

996
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:08,870
Ow! Ow! Ow!

997
01:07:12,384 --> 01:07:14,909
I'd better hold it. Okay?

998
01:07:17,055 --> 01:07:19,353
We should try to keep it
on an angle...

999
01:07:19,424 --> 01:07:22,154
so we could slip this over
when we're through.

1000
01:07:24,530 --> 01:07:27,465
Ow! You got me
on the foot again there, Lloyd.

1001
01:07:31,670 --> 01:07:34,434
It's a good job.
Thanks, Lloyd.

1002
01:07:36,208 --> 01:07:38,676
Let's get some water or something.

1003
01:07:42,047 --> 01:07:45,881
Nice job on the tent, Sturges.
Okay, boys, might as well settle in.

1004
01:07:45,951 --> 01:07:48,044
We're gonna have to spend the night.

1005
01:07:55,460 --> 01:07:57,792
Well, it doesn't get
much better than this, eh, Guides?

1006
01:08:00,332 --> 01:08:01,736
Hey, anybody feel like a story?

1007
01:08:01,737 --> 01:08:02,459
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1008
01:08:02,534 --> 01:08:04,297
- Excellent idea. Excellent.
- Yeah.

1009
01:08:04,369 --> 01:08:06,769
- Can I borrow your headdress, Chet?
- Yeah, sure.

1010
01:08:09,908 --> 01:08:12,672
Be very careful.

1011
01:08:13,679 --> 01:08:16,147
All right.
Thank you. Very good.

1012
01:08:17,916 --> 01:08:20,214
Okay. Now...

1013
01:08:20,285 --> 01:08:23,186
this is a very old Indian legend...

1014
01:08:23,255 --> 01:08:25,883
passed down from
generation to generation.

1015
01:08:25,958 --> 01:08:29,223
Either that or I saw it
on an episode of F Troop.

1016
01:08:29,294 --> 01:08:31,234
You remember that
show where all the...

1017
01:08:31,235 --> 01:08:33,390
Indians were played
by Italian actors?

1018
01:08:33,465 --> 01:08:35,899
Them all talk like this.

1019
01:08:35,968 --> 01:08:38,630
Uh, real Native Americans
don't talk like that.

1020
01:08:39,338 --> 01:08:41,670
Yes, Squatting Dog know this...

1021
01:08:41,740 --> 01:08:44,231
but intend use only for comic effect.

1022
01:08:45,277 --> 01:08:47,768
Okay.

1023
01:08:47,846 --> 01:08:52,715
Many moon ago was
young Lakota brave named Young Crab.

1024
01:08:52,784 --> 01:08:55,878
So called because
him always in a lousy mood.

1025
01:08:55,954 --> 01:08:59,913
Especially after father
skipped camp with secretary.

1026
01:08:59,992 --> 01:09:04,088
Leave Young Crab all alone,
take care of mother named Lots a Hair.

1027
01:09:06,498 --> 01:09:11,629
Years go by. Young Crab
and Lots a Hair become inseparable.

1028
01:09:11,703 --> 01:09:13,973
Build new life.

1029
01:09:14,107 --> 01:09:18,043
Young Crab so happy, even think about
changing name to Happy Face.

1030
01:09:18,111 --> 01:09:21,740
But then one day
Lots a Hair bring home...

1031
01:09:21,814 --> 01:09:24,908
incredibly handsome Lakota warrior...

1032
01:09:24,984 --> 01:09:27,885
named Look So Darn Good.

1033
01:09:29,956 --> 01:09:33,280
She say, "Young Crab,
this Look So Darn Good."

1034
01:09:33,281 --> 01:09:35,189
I've decided to marry him.

1035
01:09:35,261 --> 01:09:37,422
"Can blame me?

1036
01:09:37,497 --> 01:09:39,556
I mean, check it out one time."

1037
01:09:40,967 --> 01:09:44,027
Young Crab not like
Look So Darn Good from get-go.

1038
01:09:44,704 --> 01:09:48,936
Not like way he ruin happy life
Young Crab have with Lots a Hair.

1039
01:09:49,008 --> 01:09:52,307
So do everything he can
to make Look So Darn Good...

1040
01:09:52,378 --> 01:09:55,142
look not so darn hot.

1041
01:09:56,916 --> 01:09:59,714
Pour glue in moccasin.

1042
01:09:59,785 --> 01:10:04,415
Order 10 pizza, have delivered
to Look So Darn Good's tepee.

1043
01:10:04,490 --> 01:10:07,948
Run up big bills calling 1-900 numbers.

1044
01:10:08,027 --> 01:10:10,860
Little Guides not try at home,
by the way.

1045
01:10:10,930 --> 01:10:13,421
Young Crab sound like him
could use some discipline.

1046
01:10:13,499 --> 01:10:16,161
Perhaps trip to woodshed in order.

1047
01:10:16,235 --> 01:10:21,070
No, no, Silver Fox.
Young Crab not need discipline.

1048
01:10:21,140 --> 01:10:25,941
Him just scared Look So Darn Good
do same thing as father...

1049
01:10:27,213 --> 01:10:29,613
run away.

1050
01:10:29,682 --> 01:10:33,709
Hurt Lots a Hair and Young Crab
all over again.

1051
01:10:33,786 --> 01:10:36,778
Look So Darn Good
must prove himself trustworthy.

1052
01:10:39,192 --> 01:10:44,152
Good medicine, Running Horse.
But trust funny thing.

1053
01:10:44,230 --> 01:10:46,698
No matter how hard one try...

1054
01:10:46,766 --> 01:10:50,202
sooner or later
bound to screw up, break trust.

1055
01:10:50,269 --> 01:10:54,330
Not mean to,
but, hey, poo happen.

1056
01:10:56,309 --> 01:10:58,834
Now what can Guides
learn from this story?

1057
01:10:58,911 --> 01:11:01,709
Um, most important thing.

1058
01:11:01,781 --> 01:11:05,376
Little Guides must never
call 1-900 numbers...

1059
01:11:05,451 --> 01:11:07,976
without parents' permission.

1060
01:11:08,054 --> 01:11:10,648
Good point, Silver Fox,
but way off as usual.

1061
01:11:10,723 --> 01:11:14,318
I think the lesson is about
the importance of communication.

1062
01:11:18,831 --> 01:11:21,265
Silent Thunder
and Talking Rock correct.

1063
01:11:21,334 --> 01:11:24,770
Communication always first step.

1064
01:11:24,837 --> 01:11:28,295
I think it also means you have to
learn to have faith in people...

1065
01:11:28,374 --> 01:11:30,968
even if sometimes
they disappoint you.

1066
01:11:31,043 --> 01:11:33,671
Dark Eagle hit nail right on head.

1067
01:11:34,947 --> 01:11:38,348
Great story
and a good lesson for all of us.

1068
01:11:38,417 --> 01:11:40,317
- Good story, Jack.
- All right.

1069
01:11:40,386 --> 01:11:42,854
- Yeah!
- Great story, Jack.

1070
01:12:04,243 --> 01:12:06,871
I'm hungry, Dad.
When are we eating?

1071
01:12:06,946 --> 01:12:09,210
Ah, we gotta go down
to the stream and catch our breakfast.

1072
01:12:09,282 --> 01:12:11,944
- Hey, Chief, is that coffee ready yet?
- Just about.

1073
01:12:12,018 --> 01:12:14,816
- Can we have bacon and eggs?
- If it's in the stream.

1074
01:12:33,072 --> 01:12:35,597
Morning, Jack.
How'd you sleep?

1075
01:12:35,675 --> 01:12:39,509
Fine. Fine.
Have you seen Ben?

1076
01:12:39,578 --> 01:12:44,515
Yeah. I asked him to go down
to the creek and fill up the canteens.

1077
01:12:44,583 --> 01:12:48,883
Oh, well, I'm glad you asked him
and not me. We'd all die of thirst.

1078
01:12:49,388 --> 01:12:53,415
- Remember what I told you, buddy.
- Yeah, just keep at it.

1079
01:12:53,492 --> 01:12:57,553
But I gotta tell you, Chet,
I'm about ready to give up.

1080
01:12:57,630 --> 01:13:00,224
I've tried everything I can
think of to get through to him.

1081
01:13:00,299 --> 01:13:03,029
- It's just not working.
- It takes time.

1082
01:13:03,102 --> 01:13:05,570
Believe it or not, you're doing fine.

1083
01:13:07,039 --> 01:13:10,475
Yeah, real fine.

1084
01:13:19,185 --> 01:13:22,279
Come on, Tony. Get out of the water.
You're gonna ruin your suit.

1085
01:13:29,061 --> 01:13:31,621
Hey, I got one!
I got one!

1086
01:13:31,697 --> 01:13:35,929
Hey, Murray, Joey, look at this.
I actually caught a fish!

1087
01:13:36,001 --> 01:13:38,128
I'm a regular
Jacques Cousteau over here!

1088
01:13:38,204 --> 01:13:39,520
You're not gonna believe it.

1089
01:13:39,521 --> 01:13:42,106
This is the first time I've
fished in my entire life!

1090
01:13:42,174 --> 01:13:44,142
I could actually enjoy this.

1091
01:13:44,210 --> 01:13:46,183
Murray, after we kill
this Sturges guy, maybe...

1092
01:13:46,184 --> 01:13:47,941
we can come back here
and do this again.

1093
01:13:49,014 --> 01:13:51,744
Jack.

1094
01:13:55,388 --> 01:13:58,255
- Jack, Jack!
- What's the matter?

1095
01:13:58,324 --> 01:14:01,054
There's some guys
over there in suits fishing.

1096
01:14:01,127 --> 01:14:04,028
One of'em said they came
up here to kill you.

1097
01:14:04,096 --> 01:14:06,656
- Where are they?
- Over there by the creek.

1098
01:14:12,037 --> 01:14:14,597
Come on, Tony.
Enough with the fishing already!

1099
01:14:14,673 --> 01:14:17,870
Just one more. Just one more!
I'm gettin' really good at this.

1100
01:14:17,943 --> 01:14:22,141
Yeah, if you were as good at arranging car
accidents, Sturges would be dead by now...

1101
01:14:22,214 --> 01:14:24,512
and we wouldn't be
sittin' around in the forest...

1102
01:14:24,583 --> 01:14:26,881
like Robin Hood and his merry men!

1103
01:14:30,456 --> 01:14:32,515
What accident
are they talking about, Jack?

1104
01:14:32,591 --> 01:14:34,525
I thought you just had
some car trouble.

1105
01:14:34,593 --> 01:14:37,084
I did have some car trouble.
I just didn't tell you how much.

1106
01:14:37,163 --> 01:14:39,154
Okay, so tell me now.

1107
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:43,534
Jack, tell me.

1108
01:14:43,602 --> 01:14:47,595
All right. Those guys did something
to the brakes of my car.

1109
01:14:47,673 --> 01:14:50,972
- I ended up in the bay. No big deal.
- No big deal? Why didn't you tell me?

1110
01:14:51,043 --> 01:14:54,012
- Didn't wanna worry you or your mom.
- I-I-I thought you made up...

1111
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:57,207
the car trouble story
to get out of going on the canoe trip.

1112
01:14:57,283 --> 01:14:59,938
If you had told me you
had a real accident,

1113
01:14:59,939 --> 01:15:02,050
I... I wouldn't have
gotten so upset.

1114
01:15:02,121 --> 01:15:04,316
Sorry. I tried to do the right thing.

1115
01:15:04,390 --> 01:15:07,052
Hey, Chet, I need you
to do something for me.

1116
01:15:09,395 --> 01:15:11,305
Don't ask a lot of
questions, but some guys

1117
01:15:11,306 --> 01:15:13,257
followed me up here.
They're sort of after me.

1118
01:15:13,258 --> 01:15:14,628
What do you mean "after you"?

1119
01:15:14,700 --> 01:15:19,160
I sent a man to prison for 50 years,
and his son's a little upset about it.

1120
01:15:19,238 --> 01:15:21,604
All right.
What do you want us to do?

1121
01:15:21,674 --> 01:15:25,371
You and the boys head back down
to the ranger station to try to get help.

1122
01:15:26,445 --> 01:15:29,744
I'll lead them further up
the mountain till you get back.

1123
01:15:29,815 --> 01:15:32,249
I don't know, Jack.
We could stay here. We could help.

1124
01:15:33,986 --> 01:15:36,113
I must concur with Silent Thunder
on that point, Jack.

1125
01:15:36,188 --> 01:15:38,588
There are eight of us.
There's gotta be something we can do.

1126
01:15:38,657 --> 01:15:40,892
I really appreciate it.
It's very nice of you guys.

1127
01:15:40,893 --> 01:15:42,525
But they're after me,
not any of you.

1128
01:15:42,595 --> 01:15:45,758
It's too dangerous to stay together.
Better we split up.

1129
01:15:45,831 --> 01:15:48,732
All right.
We'll get back as quick as we can.

1130
01:15:48,801 --> 01:15:51,099
Little Guides, let's move out!
Move out! Come on!

1131
01:15:51,170 --> 01:15:54,469
- That means you too, Ben.
- No way. I'm staying here with you.

1132
01:15:54,540 --> 01:15:57,737
- You're not staying with me.
- But I can help.

1133
01:15:57,810 --> 01:16:00,802
You could be more help by making sure
the others get down okay.

1134
01:16:02,381 --> 01:16:05,248
Now go on, get out of here.
I mean it.

1135
01:16:10,723 --> 01:16:13,248
Ben.

1136
01:16:14,927 --> 01:16:16,918
Thanks anyway.
I appreciate it.

1137
01:16:20,699 --> 01:16:22,963
I'll go around this way
and meet you on the other side.

1138
01:16:23,035 --> 01:16:25,094
- Yeah. Bet you we beat you there!
- You're on!

1139
01:16:26,639 --> 01:16:29,608
I got you now, Sturges.

1140
01:16:29,675 --> 01:16:32,007
Murray, Tony, get ready!

1141
01:16:32,077 --> 01:16:34,637
The fun is about to begin.

1142
01:17:10,449 --> 01:17:12,713
Great. Just what I need.

1143
01:17:46,045 --> 01:17:49,105
- Gesundheit.
- Ben, what are you doing here?

1144
01:17:49,782 --> 01:17:52,012
I came back here to help you.
What do you think?

1145
01:17:52,084 --> 01:17:55,110
- I don't need any help.
- Oh, really?

1146
01:17:55,188 --> 01:17:58,248
And what were you planning to do
when those guys found you?

1147
01:17:58,324 --> 01:18:00,588
Lie there and pretend to be a slug?

1148
01:18:00,660 --> 01:18:03,458
Exactly. Now get out of here.
You're blowing my cover.

1149
01:18:03,529 --> 01:18:07,021
You can't tell me what to do.
You're not my father.

1150
01:18:07,099 --> 01:18:09,829
I knew you were gonna
say that eventually.

1151
01:18:12,371 --> 01:18:14,362
Oh, geez.

1152
01:18:16,409 --> 01:18:18,877
So how's the leg?

1153
01:18:18,945 --> 01:18:20,879
Except for the throbbing pain,
it's great.

1154
01:18:20,947 --> 01:18:23,472
Well, then we can't outrun 'em.

1155
01:18:24,984 --> 01:18:29,148
So we're gonna have to slow 'em up
until the others get back with help.

1156
01:18:29,222 --> 01:18:32,521
We wouldn't stand a chance.
These guys are hired killers with guns.

1157
01:18:32,592 --> 01:18:35,060
So? We've got bows and arrows
and a tomahawk.

1158
01:18:36,562 --> 01:18:39,053
We're gonna need something
more than that.

1159
01:18:39,131 --> 01:18:42,191
Well, Red Crow told me
that when you need an answer...

1160
01:18:42,268 --> 01:18:45,795
you just listen to nature
and the answer will be provided to you.

1161
01:18:45,872 --> 01:18:48,340
How do you know he wasn't
kidding you again?

1162
01:18:48,407 --> 01:18:50,773
Trust me.

1163
01:18:52,578 --> 01:18:54,705
Okay, I'll listen.

1164
01:18:58,718 --> 01:19:02,017
Could you ask nature to speak up?
I can't hear a thing.

1165
01:19:15,902 --> 01:19:19,099
Well, thank you, Red Crow.

1166
01:19:42,461 --> 01:19:44,861
All right, slow and easy.

1167
01:19:47,266 --> 01:19:49,257
Hold on. Hold on.
Don't get away from me.

1168
01:19:58,144 --> 01:20:00,271
Easy, Ben.
Don't shake it.

1169
01:20:05,918 --> 01:20:08,284
That's good.
Steady, steady.

1170
01:20:09,755 --> 01:20:11,746
- What's the matter with you?
- I slipped.

1171
01:20:11,824 --> 01:20:14,588
- Murray, get him on his feet.
- Come on, Tony. Get up.

1172
01:20:14,660 --> 01:20:17,458
- Come on. You look ridiculous.
- Come on. Get up. Geez!

1173
01:20:17,530 --> 01:20:20,192
Hey, your hands are filthy.
Don't touch the suit.

1174
01:20:39,986 --> 01:20:42,420
You guys go that way.
I'm goin' this way.

1175
01:20:45,358 --> 01:20:47,918
- Think this guy knows what he's doing?
- I don't know.

1176
01:21:01,707 --> 01:21:03,147
Look at this suit. It's full of twigs.

1177
01:21:03,148 --> 01:21:05,609
That guy on Fourth Street's never
gonna be able to get 'em out.

1178
01:21:05,678 --> 01:21:08,169
What are you complaining about?
I got fish goop all over my pants.

1179
01:21:08,247 --> 01:21:10,909
Tony, I'm telling you, never call me
for a job like this again. Never!

1180
01:21:10,983 --> 01:21:13,008
Don't worry, I won't.
Who needs you?

1181
01:21:13,085 --> 01:21:15,383
Ah! Indian stuff.

1182
01:21:18,658 --> 01:21:21,354
We got him.

1183
01:21:21,427 --> 01:21:23,622
We got him. We got him.

1184
01:21:24,697 --> 01:21:26,562
Okay, you ready?

1185
01:21:26,632 --> 01:21:28,623
Ready. Let's do it.

1186
01:21:30,670 --> 01:21:32,934
We got him.

1187
01:21:33,005 --> 01:21:36,270
Hey, hey, hey.
Look at this.

1188
01:21:36,342 --> 01:21:39,607
Here's more of that beaded junk.
They gotta be around here somewhere.

1189
01:21:45,451 --> 01:21:49,012
- Hey, look. It's his kid.
- What the hell's he doing?

1190
01:21:49,789 --> 01:21:52,451
I think he's gonna shoot us
with his little bow and arrow.

1191
01:21:52,525 --> 01:21:56,017
- Oh, I'm really scared.
- Yeah, maybe we should take cover.

1192
01:22:07,940 --> 01:22:09,737
- Beehive!
- Beehive!

1193
01:22:12,311 --> 01:22:16,247
Tony, they're bitin' me!
Tell them to leave me alone!

1194
01:22:22,888 --> 01:22:25,618
- Good shot, Little Wing.
- You too, Squatting Dog.

1195
01:22:25,691 --> 01:22:28,251
You know, we really oughta
think about changing my name.

1196
01:22:29,328 --> 01:22:33,662
Good idea.
How about Dead Meat?

1197
01:22:47,079 --> 01:22:50,344
Not so tough now, are ya, Sturges?

1198
01:22:50,416 --> 01:22:54,250
Hey, if you want to beg for your life
like a little worm...

1199
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:56,311
go ahead!

1200
01:22:58,958 --> 01:23:02,189
You know, Joey, I have to say I expected
something better than this from you.

1201
01:23:02,728 --> 01:23:05,026
- What are you talkin' about?
- Oh, come on, Joey.

1202
01:23:05,097 --> 01:23:07,793
The old seal-'em-up-in-an-abandoned-mine-
with-dynamite routine?

1203
01:23:07,867 --> 01:23:11,462
- What's wrong with it?
- It's boring, that's what it is.

1204
01:23:11,537 --> 01:23:13,562
Shows a complete lack of imagination.

1205
01:23:13,639 --> 01:23:17,234
Yeah, right. And I suppose you could
think of something better?

1206
01:23:18,244 --> 01:23:20,303
Without even trying.

1207
01:23:20,379 --> 01:23:23,280
You could hurl us off a cliff
onto some jagged rocks, for example.

1208
01:23:23,349 --> 01:23:25,510
That's not any better.

1209
01:23:25,584 --> 01:23:29,577
Yeah, but first you could drill holes in
the back of our head with a power tool...

1210
01:23:29,655 --> 01:23:32,180
to make it look like
an industrial accident.

1211
01:23:32,258 --> 01:23:34,556
That makes it better.

1212
01:23:34,627 --> 01:23:38,324
Or if you were really clever,
you'd wrap us up in wet rawhide...

1213
01:23:38,397 --> 01:23:40,558
so when it dried out
it'd mash up all our bones...

1214
01:23:40,633 --> 01:23:44,831
and squeeze our internal organs out through
our orifices like a tube of toothpaste.

1215
01:23:48,407 --> 01:23:50,773
I saw it on America's Most Wanted.

1216
01:23:50,843 --> 01:23:54,142
Let me tell you something, Sturges.
This kid is sick.

1217
01:23:54,213 --> 01:23:56,807
If I wasn't gonna kill
the two of youse...

1218
01:23:56,882 --> 01:24:00,283
I'd suggest you get him
psychiatric help immediately.

1219
01:24:00,352 --> 01:24:02,582
Tony, go ahead.
Light the fuse...

1220
01:24:02,655 --> 01:24:06,216
before this little demento
get's any more ideas.

1221
01:24:11,831 --> 01:24:14,595
Bye-bye, Sturges!

1222
01:24:16,769 --> 01:24:19,169
Bye-bye, kid!

1223
01:24:19,238 --> 01:24:21,798
Jack, what are we gonna do?

1224
01:24:21,874 --> 01:24:24,138
Don't worry, Ben. It'll be okay.

1225
01:24:52,404 --> 01:24:55,430
What the hell is this?
Charades?

1226
01:24:58,344 --> 01:25:01,211
He says, throw down your weapons
or else he'll turn you into large...

1227
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:03,544
stupid-looking pincushions.

1228
01:25:03,616 --> 01:25:05,811
Actually, he didn't say "stupid-looking."
I added that.

1229
01:25:05,885 --> 01:25:09,321
Yeah, right.
Like I'm really gonna surrender...

1230
01:25:09,388 --> 01:25:12,323
to one screwball
with a bow and arrow.

1231
01:25:12,391 --> 01:25:15,326
Murray, put a bullet in his head.

1232
01:25:15,394 --> 01:25:17,385
Excuse me, there.

1233
01:25:18,564 --> 01:25:21,722
Point of order.
I believe it is illegal...

1234
01:25:21,723 --> 01:25:24,283
to possess firearms in a state park.

1235
01:25:26,294 --> 01:25:29,991
As a duly authorized representative of
the Department of Motor Vehicles...

1236
01:25:30,064 --> 01:25:33,625
a state agency, I'm gonna have to
confiscate those weapons.

1237
01:25:33,701 --> 01:25:37,603
Oh, now there's two of them.
I'm really scared.

1238
01:25:37,672 --> 01:25:39,663
Make that three!

1239
01:25:41,175 --> 01:25:44,303
- Four!
- Five!

1240
01:25:44,379 --> 01:25:46,847
Six!

1241
01:25:46,914 --> 01:25:49,747
We're surrounded.
What do we do now, Joey?

1242
01:25:49,817 --> 01:25:51,876
They got little bows and arrows.
You got guns.

1243
01:25:51,953 --> 01:25:54,513
What do you think you do?
Shoot them!

1244
01:25:54,589 --> 01:25:57,114
Okay, Guides, let 'em have it!

1245
01:26:00,661 --> 01:26:05,530
Geronimo!

1246
01:26:07,802 --> 01:26:11,203
Okay, that's it.
No more playin' around.

1247
01:26:11,272 --> 01:26:14,639
I don't think so, Joey.

1248
01:26:14,709 --> 01:26:18,008
Red, here's another piece of garbage
you can add to the pile.

1249
01:26:19,113 --> 01:26:22,674
Sure thing, Squatting Dog.
Okay, dirtbags, on your feet.

1250
01:26:22,750 --> 01:26:25,844
Remember, no smart stuff.
I got the gun. Come on. Get up!

1251
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:28,354
Come on.
Get up, get up, get up, get up.

1252
01:26:30,058 --> 01:26:31,992
- Wow!
- Get up, get up, get up.

1253
01:26:33,161 --> 01:26:36,028
- You guys okay?
- Couldn't be better, Chet.

1254
01:26:36,097 --> 01:26:39,328
- Thanks for coming back.
- Hey, we're Indian Guides...

1255
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:41,527
and Indian Guides stick together.

1256
01:26:41,602 --> 01:26:42,779
That's what it's all about.

1257
01:26:42,780 --> 01:26:45,265
Besides, if we'd tried to
get to that ranger station...

1258
01:26:45,339 --> 01:26:47,705
we would've got lost
in about eight seconds.

1259
01:26:58,453 --> 01:27:00,751
Thanks, Lloyd.
That was a great shot.

1260
01:27:07,095 --> 01:27:10,531
You know, Ben, those are the weirdest
bunch of guys I ever met.

1261
01:27:11,666 --> 01:27:15,534
- But I like 'em.
- Yeah, they're definitely unusual.

1262
01:27:15,603 --> 01:27:17,537
But who wants normal anyway, right?

1263
01:27:20,408 --> 01:27:24,902
Uh, Ben, uh, I wanted to thank
you too, for coming back.

1264
01:27:24,979 --> 01:27:27,174
It was a very brave thing to do.

1265
01:27:27,248 --> 01:27:29,216
Well, I couldn't just let 'em kill you.

1266
01:27:30,685 --> 01:27:34,621
After all, I think my mom wants to
keep you around for a while.

1267
01:27:36,457 --> 01:27:39,119
And, well...

1268
01:27:41,062 --> 01:27:43,360
I guess I do too.

1269
01:27:45,533 --> 01:27:47,592
Let's go home.

1270
01:27:50,705 --> 01:27:54,539
So, Ben, now that we're buddies,
is it okay if I marry your mom?

1271
01:27:54,609 --> 01:27:56,543
Well, I don't know, Jack.

1272
01:27:56,611 --> 01:27:59,603
There are a few things
I need to know about you first.

1273
01:28:03,084 --> 01:28:05,018
Is that all you make?

1274
01:28:05,086 --> 01:28:07,020
It's not exactly minimum wage, Ben.

1275
01:28:07,088 --> 01:28:10,387
But I thought you were some big-shot
attorney for the federal government.

1276
01:28:10,458 --> 01:28:13,894
Well, what they don't pay in salary,
they make up for in benefits.

1277
01:28:13,961 --> 01:28:15,724
Which, by the way,
will come in very handy...

1278
01:28:15,796 --> 01:28:19,732
when they replace all the teeth
I'm gonna knock out of your little head.

1279
01:28:20,868 --> 01:28:23,200
Any bad habits I should know about?

1280
01:28:23,271 --> 01:28:25,603
Let's see. I drink milk
straight from the carton.

1281
01:28:25,673 --> 01:28:30,042
Sometimes I use a spoon
and put it right back in the drawer.

1282
01:28:30,611 --> 01:28:32,814
Any chance you might turn
into a serial killer...

1283
01:28:32,815 --> 01:28:34,445
and start boiling our
heads in acid?

1284
01:28:34,515 --> 01:28:37,882
Don't be silly.
I haven't done that in years.

1285
01:28:39,854 --> 01:28:44,791
- So, do I pass the test?
- You'll do, I guess.

1286
01:28:45,326 --> 01:28:48,134
Do you mind if I tell
your mother the good news?

1287
01:28:48,135 --> 01:28:50,085
Yeah, sure. Go ahead.

1288
01:28:52,433 --> 01:28:55,561
Oh, by the way,
that thing about, uh, boiling heads?

1289
01:28:55,636 --> 01:28:57,627
I lied.

1290
01:28:59,173 --> 01:29:01,801
- Jack.
- What? Okay, I didn't lie.

1291
01:29:01,876 --> 01:29:04,174
No, no, come here.
Look what you've done.

1292
01:29:08,950 --> 01:29:11,885
Huh. It's a circle.

1293
01:29:16,324 --> 01:29:18,519
- Sandy!
- Mom!

1294
01:29:18,593 --> 01:29:21,061
- What's the matter?
- Come here. Look what Jack did.

1295
01:29:32,540 --> 01:29:35,839
Well, what do you know.
It's done.

1296
01:29:54,962 --> 01:29:59,058
♪ <i>Love
Love</i> ♪

1297
01:29:59,133 --> 01:30:01,294
- <i>As you probably already figured out...</i>
- ♪ <i>Devotion</i>

1298
01:30:01,369 --> 01:30:03,234
<i>I let Jack marry my mother.</i>

1299
01:30:03,304 --> 01:30:05,829
<i>It seemed only fair after
