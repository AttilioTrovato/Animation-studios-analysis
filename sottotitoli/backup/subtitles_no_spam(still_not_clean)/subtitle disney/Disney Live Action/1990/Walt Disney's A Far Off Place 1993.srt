1
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:52,683
<i>Look out! Get 'em!</i>

2
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:05,362
<i>Burn the place!</i>

3
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,265
<i>Harry!</i>

4
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,752
<i>Kill the girl!</i>

5
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:31,960
<i>Harry!</i>

6
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:48,011
Mrs. Parker, tell him stop!

7
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:51,050
Koba, I tell him to stop,
you have to carry water every day

8
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:55,486
- from the well to the new garden.
- I walk. I carry. Just tell him stop.

9
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:59,047
You'll be nuts for it.
Turn on the faucet, out comes water.

10
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:02,959
Faucet. Bullshit.

11
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:06,726
Koba? Who's been helping you
with your English?

12
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:09,666
Miss Nonnie has.

13
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,160
I'll kill her.

14
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:24,947
It's only three weeks.
It won't kill you to be nice.

15
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:28,077
- Mopani's taking me on patrol next week.
- That's out.

16
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:30,622
Why? Just because I have to baby-sit
some American boy?

17
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,590
No, because it's dangerous.

18
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:36,958
Well, Mopani says I'm ready.
I can hit a flying can at 20 meters, Dad.

19
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:40,856
What are you talking about?
Shooting poachers?

20
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:44,464
It's only in self-defense.

21
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:48,702
- Mopani says I'm ready.
- Mopani and I disagree.

22
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:51,073
- Dynamite.
- Hintza. Come.

23
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,748
- But he's your friend.
- You can disagree with friends.

24
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:05,121
- Not with your father?
- Disagree, yes. Disobey, no.

25
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:09,491
You know, Dad, people need to stand up
and fight for what they believe in,

26
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:11,689
or nothing's ever going to change.

27
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:14,824
<i>People need to sit down and talk.
Otherwise, people won't change.</i>

28
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:30,944
<i>All right.</i>

29
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:38,114
<i>Africa. First impression:</i>

30
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:41,718
<i>Bone dry and boring:
Dust everywhere:</i>

31
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:47,824
<i>Hunter's Drift
is a very famous place, you know.</i>

32
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:52,462
- What?
- Hunter's Drift is a very famous place.

33
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:58,033
Famous for what?

34
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,738
Mr. Parker is the first wildlife commissioner

35
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:04,544
to employ the locals
and split the profits with them.

36
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:11,112
Oh. So, is there
anything to do around here?

37
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:16,093
We grow the food, take care of the reserve,
and if there is a sickness...

38
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:22,397
No, I mean, to do. You know, basketball,
go to the movies, any good concerts?

39
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:43,349
<i>Three weeks: I hope they have
a satellite dish where we're staying:</i>

40
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:46,357
<i>Or at least a VCR:</i>

41
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:55,757
Steve.

42
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:01,066
It's good to see you, Liz.

43
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:09,543
Uh... this is Harry.

44
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:13,279
I was a good friend of your mother's
a long time ago.

45
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:16,185
I'm so pleased you could visit us.

46
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:19,122
- Yeah, me too.
- Come on in. Let's get you settled.

47
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:22,649
Yeah, I'd like to stretch my legs,
if that's all right.

48
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:28,291
- Wouldn't you like a cold drink?
- I think I'll work up a thirst.

49
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:34,929
He wanted to spend
his vacation in Utah, skiing.

50
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:38,170
- Oh.
- I had to twist his arm.

51
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:42,908
- I hope I didn't break it.
- No. He'll have a swell time.

52
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,615
This is beautiful.

53
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:03,429
Hey. Come on, Hin.

54
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:25,521
<i>What? Stay.</i>

55
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:32,120
Hey!

56
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,525
- Nonnie!
- Get out of the way!

57
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:38,593
<i>Mr: Parker Get down!</i>

58
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:53,045
Nonnie!

59
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:58,851
What the hell is going on, huh?
Are you crazy?

60
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:01,085
Look what you did to me!

61
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,355
- Nonnie, are you OK?
- Yeah.

62
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:06,523
Are you OK?
Didn't you see the sign?

63
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:11,593
What sign? Look, I was just
taking a walk, all right?

64
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:15,630
My name's Harry Winslow.
Maybe you want to skip the handshake?

65
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:20,668
Paul Parker.
This is my daughter Nonnie.

66
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:22,714
Yeah. We met.

67
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:34,855
Hintza! It's for the cat.
You already had yours.

68
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:43,431
Harry! Oh, how nice you look.

69
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:45,902
Come over here
and sit next to Nonnie, OK?

70
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,269
Yeah, sure.

71
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:56,380
- Thanks for waiting.
- Waiting for what?

72
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:59,509
In New York,
it's polite to wait for your guests.

73
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:02,679
Out here it's polite to thank somebody
for saving your butt.

74
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:06,191
- My butt thanks you.
- "My butt thanks you. "

75
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:09,887
Is that how you say
"thank you" in New York?

76
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:12,931
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

77
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,592
Nonnie.

78
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:20,431
So who's that guy?

79
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:23,839
That's Ricketts.
He's one of my dad's friends.

80
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,413
Pâté?

81
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,784
Pâté?

82
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:39,589
- No.
- Dad told me this place was a desert.

83
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:44,686
No. That's 20 miles west.
It's called the Kalahari.

84
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:49,460
Looks pretty green to me.

85
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:55,997
Well, it... The Kalahari isn't the Sahara.
It's got dunes, but there's also...

86
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,471
...but there's also bush and salt pans.

87
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:03,879
Nonnie, cat food belongs on the ground.

88
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:23,528
You have to talk to Daddy.
He says I can't go.

89
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:26,298
<i>Slow down, slow down.</i>

90
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,967
So is it true?
You arrested 20 poachers before lunch?

91
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:37,038
Well, it was after lunch,
and the number's a little bit off.

92
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:41,883
There were 117
coming at me from behind.

93
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:44,821
- So, will you talk to him?
- I'll try.

94
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,017
I've got a present for you.

95
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,228
Oh...

96
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:59,036
It belonged to my father.
It was mine, now it's yours.

97
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:01,664
Give it to your firstborn
and tell him about me.

98
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,004
You tell him yourself.

99
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,504
And you think killing
poachers is gonna do it?

100
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:43,844
No, but it's a start.

101
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:47,511
I've lost more elephants in the last
three months than in all of last year.

102
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:50,419
- Mopani, I have audits...
- Am I interrupting something?

103
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:53,390
...on every trade and exportation
company in the country.

104
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:57,418
- Paperwork. That's all you got.
- I know we're dealing with a corporation.

105
00:14:57,496 --> 00:14:59,589
They must be getting ready
to make a shipment.

106
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:02,862
- What makes you say that?
- My petition locked the borders.

107
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:07,963
Exportation stopped, but poaching didn't.
All those tusks are stored somewhere.

108
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:12,409
- Can I see those?
- You can keep these. I have a copy.

109
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:15,276
I'm going to Karlstown tomorrow
to have them analyzed.

110
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:17,713
Then I'm gonna see
the Minister of the Interior.

111
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:19,774
And what will he do?

112
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:22,150
- Form another committee?
- What would you suggest,

113
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:24,985
- shooting them all?
- That's exactly what I would suggest.

114
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:29,960
- Well, he who lives by the sword...
- Stays alive a day longer.

115
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:33,290
- He's right, you know.
- Not you, too.

116
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:40,100
I mean about staying alive.
Paul, you're my friend. Let it go.

117
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:45,110
I really don't think you understand
the kind of men you're dealing with.

118
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:55,576
I understand they're
butchering the soul of Africa.

119
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:59,647
- You talk like a bloody missionary.
- And why not?

120
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:02,091
<i>This is the last country with a soul.</i>

121
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,514
That's cool.

122
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,877
Hi.

123
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:24,627
Shut up, Hin. Hintza!

124
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:29,937
Good night.

125
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,631
<i>OK, I'm coming.</i>

126
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:32,294
What is it, Hintza?

127
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:47,179
Xhabbo!

128
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,718
Xhabbo.

129
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:03,567
- Danger, Nonnie.
- No, it's OK. Can you stand up?

130
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:07,628
- Danger.
- Come on, stand up. Lean on me.

131
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:10,274
- Let's go back to the house.
- No. Cave.

132
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:15,109
- No, your leg is hurt. Let's go back...
- Cave!

133
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:18,013
OK. Cave.

134
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:47,469
D- don't shoot. It's me, Harry.

135
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,340
- Harry.
- What are you doing out here?

136
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:56,251
Walking off the pâté. Who's he?

137
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:58,983
It's none of your business.
Just go back to the house.

138
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:03,359
Harry must come with
Xhabbo and Nonnie.

139
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,396
What? To the cave?

140
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,833
Well, hey. I'm invited. Let's go.

141
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:26,150
<i>- So, what happened to him?
- "Him" has a name: Xhabbo.</i>

142
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:30,882
- So what happened to Xhabbo?
- You don't want to know.

143
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:37,454
- What? A lion get him?
- No, it was a leopard.

144
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:18,469
Those must be a million years old.
How'd you find this place?

145
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:21,563
I didn't. Xhabbo showed me.

146
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:28,736
Here. Smash these.

147
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:41,520
Ugh. Look, this guy needs
antibiotics, not voodoo.

148
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:53,364
You know,
I got Band-Aids back in my room.

149
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:58,173
Here.

150
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,477
This should help you sleep.

151
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:10,379
<i>Promise. Stay in cave, Nonnie.</i>

152
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:14,516
What is it?
Did you have a tapping?

153
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:19,361
<i>What did you see?</i>

154
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:21,865
OK. I promise.

155
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:26,296
And Harry?

156
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:31,274
No, no, no.
I'm not spending the night in here.

157
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:34,371
Scared of sleeping in a cave?

158
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:39,315
What do you think? After camping out
in Central Park, you know, this is...

159
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:42,376
Well, then what's the big deal?

160
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:38,100
Stay here, Hintza.

161
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:27,644
<i>Don't look at me.
Go and empty the rooms. Go on.</i>

162
00:27:53,538 --> 00:27:57,736
<i>I'll tell you what we leave.
Get out of that.</i>

163
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:02,839
Bring it along, bring it along.

164
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:11,649
So, everyone taken care of?

165
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:14,624
The children aren't here.
We looked everywhere.

166
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,594
Two kids on foot.
How far can they get?

167
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:44,947
- OK, now take care of the rest of the room.
- Yes, my boss.

168
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:47,457
- Don't forget the computer.
- Yes, boss.

169
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,169
OK...

170
00:30:15,246 --> 00:30:19,649
The girl!
Under the truck! Get her!

171
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,228
Whoa!

172
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,566
What the hell is going on?

173
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,179
Talk to me!

174
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:26,315
Tell me, goddamn it!

175
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:28,682
They killed them!

176
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:34,987
Don't you understand?
They killed everybody!

177
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:39,860
My mother and father,
your father, Koba, everybody!

178
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:50,773
I've got to go to the border station
and radio Mopani.

179
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:57,946
- I'm going down there.
- You go tell Xhabbo what happened.

180
00:31:58,016 --> 00:32:00,610
And you stay with him
in that cave until I come back!

181
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:12,619
<i>I don't believe you!</i>

182
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:16,659
OK, let's spread out!
Come on, men, move it!

183
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:35,144
Samual!

184
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:52,429
<i>They are with Mantis now.</i>

185
00:32:55,039 --> 00:33:02,571
Gods are like old people.
You think they are deaf, but they are not.

186
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:09,452
Pain gets better
when you find good name.

187
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:16,388
This is "Cave you cried for your father".

188
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:37,477
We gotta get out of here. They smashed
the radio. And they killed Samual.

189
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:40,813
- I couldn't reach Mopani.
- Tapping told Xhabbo,

190
00:33:40,885 --> 00:33:46,084
"Danger for Nonnie and Harry. "
Not for parents.

191
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:58,892
I'm sorry. They were poachers,
and my dad was trying to stop them.

192
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:02,462
Yeah, well, my father wasn't.
He was just a tourist.

193
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:06,340
- We follow wind.
- What do you mean?

194
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:09,278
Xhabbo had a tapping.
We follow wind.

195
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:11,747
I don't care what you had.
You follow the wind.

196
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:14,011
- I want the nearest town.
- But the wind blows west.

197
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:16,519
Are you listening to me?
I said the nearest town with a phone.

198
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:17,849
Shh.

199
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:23,026
Are you saying we should cross
the Kalahari? That's impossible.

200
00:34:23,094 --> 00:34:26,621
Wind can do it, we can do it.

201
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:28,961
Just bring me to the nearest town.

202
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:59,726
- Where's he going?
- To see if they're following us.

203
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:11,972
- So how far are we going?
- It's pretty far.

204
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:16,646
So what was all that crap
about following the wind?

205
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:20,172
It's not crap. He had a tapping.

206
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:26,681
That crap saved your life.

207
00:35:26,757 --> 00:35:30,716
How do you think he knew
we were in danger last night?

208
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:33,286
Bushmen see the future.

209
00:35:35,766 --> 00:35:38,496
You wouldn't understand.

210
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:42,630
- And you believe in this?
- I don't know.

211
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:49,069
My father did.

212
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:55,012
Tapping's kind of like
knocking on a door.

213
00:35:55,086 --> 00:36:00,854
And when the door opens, they can
see things that the eyes can't see

214
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:04,794
and hear things that the ears don't hear.

215
00:36:12,036 --> 00:36:15,995
- Well?
- They go here.

216
00:36:16,073 --> 00:36:21,170
It looks like one. More than one people.
Was an animal, a dog.

217
00:36:21,245 --> 00:36:22,940
Which way?

218
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,106
West?

219
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,742
West is the Kalahari.
That's ridiculous.

220
00:36:26,817 --> 00:36:29,581
The girl was born and raised here.
She'd know better than that.

221
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:38,654
I didn't know it would be
so cold in Africa.

222
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:54,402
<i>What about you?</i>

223
00:37:02,186 --> 00:37:04,882
<i>Come on. Let's go.</i>

224
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:08,221
<i>- What's the big rush?
- It's trackers.</i>

225
00:37:37,488 --> 00:37:41,185
Xhabbo, they're not looking for you,
and you might get hurt.

226
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:48,461
- I want you to leave us now, OK?
- No, wait, wait. Speak for yourself.

227
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:51,228
I don't want this guy to leave.
He's our guide.

228
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:06,983
As brother and sister,
we go together or we stop.

229
00:38:52,396 --> 00:38:54,626
You need to rest?

230
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,165
No, I'm fine, thanks.

231
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:41,108
- What's he saying?
- Elephants.

232
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:44,872
Elephants.

233
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:05,297
- What's he doing?
- He's talking to them.

234
00:40:06,003 --> 00:40:08,563
Yeah, well,
I can see that, but what for?

235
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:15,568
To cover our tracks.
OK, they agree to help.

236
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:19,142
Do you want a written invitation?
Come on!

237
00:40:20,985 --> 00:40:25,615
Oh, this is great.
I'm on safari with Doctor Dolittle.

238
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:32,183
- What's wrong?
- It has gone.

239
00:41:32,256 --> 00:41:35,851
- What do you mean, gone?
- Elephants. Tracks gone.

240
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:42,991
Hunter's Drift, come in.

241
00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:48,698
<i>Hunter's Drift, come in.</i>

242
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:55,401
Hunter's Drift, come in!

243
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:27,839
- What's he saying?
- He's thanking them.

244
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,612
Thanks.

245
00:42:34,652 --> 00:42:37,348
To the ones who speak English.

246
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:46,558
<i>- Let's camp here, all right?
- We're gonna cross that?</i>

247
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:49,793
Yeah.

248
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:56,402
- The nearest town's across that?
- Mm-hm.

249
00:42:56,473 --> 00:42:58,873
- But you said that...
- When we get you to Karlstown,

250
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:02,606
we're gonna put you on a plane for New
York. That's what you wanted, isn't it?

251
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:07,617
Karlstown! Wait, Karlstown's on
the ocean. You said the nearest town!

252
00:43:07,685 --> 00:43:12,520
<i>- Karlstown is the nearest town.
- You lied to me.</i>

253
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:15,354
I didn't lie to you.
I said, "the nearest town. "

254
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,792
Yeah, and I said, "How far?"
And you said, "Pretty far. "

255
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:21,422
- 2000 kilometers is pretty far, isn't it?
- No, that's impossibly far!

256
00:43:21,498 --> 00:43:25,264
That's like walking from New York to
Miami! We're never gonna make it!

257
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:27,531
I shouldn't have even told you, OK?

258
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:30,403
- But you wouldn't have ever come.
- And how do you know?

259
00:43:30,474 --> 00:43:33,739
Because that's the kind
of person you are.

260
00:43:33,811 --> 00:43:36,336
You have no idea
what kind of person I am.

261
00:43:36,413 --> 00:43:39,280
Yeah, I do.
You're scared.

262
00:43:39,883 --> 00:43:43,284
You'd be scared, too,
if you had any sense.

263
00:43:52,062 --> 00:43:56,089
<i>So you really think
we can make it to Karlstown?</i>

264
00:43:58,202 --> 00:44:01,535
<i>Wind can do it, we can do it.</i>

265
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:06,537
I don't want that Bushman crap.
I want a real answer.

266
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:09,272
You want a real answer?

267
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:14,374
Let me hear the Bushman version again.

268
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:49,177
I could carry your bag for a while.

269
00:44:49,253 --> 00:44:51,153
Why?

270
00:44:52,589 --> 00:44:58,255
- 'Cause it's heavy.
- And if you carry it, it'll get lighter?

271
00:44:58,328 --> 00:45:01,491
- No, but...
- What, you're a guy?

272
00:45:01,565 --> 00:45:03,396
I wasn't gonna say that.

273
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:07,369
- Then what? Bigger?
- No. Nicer.

274
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:10,669
Well, it's my bag,
and I'll carry it.

275
00:45:12,676 --> 00:45:17,079
- She hates me.
- Woman's like a tree.

276
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:22,107
Harry must not judge tree
by flowers, but by fruit.

277
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:27,251
Yeah, well, flowers count for something.

278
00:45:27,324 --> 00:45:31,260
When Xhabbo first sees Nonnie,
girl is lost.

279
00:45:31,662 --> 00:45:36,122
Girl doesn't say she is lost.
Girl is afraid.

280
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,034
But she says nothing.

281
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:44,397
Yeah, well, that girl
doesn't say much of anything.

282
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:47,672
You're right. She's a tree.

283
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:05,511
Have they identified the bodies?

284
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:11,789
- No. There isn't much left.
- I see.

285
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:21,229
How ironic that...
he should die by the sword.

286
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:27,775
Look, I'll take a couple of men

287
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:32,407
and we'll see if we can
spot these poachers from the air.

288
00:47:32,482 --> 00:47:35,451
They can't be very far away.

289
00:47:42,626 --> 00:47:45,322
Mopani.

290
00:47:45,762 --> 00:47:47,855
We'll get them.

291
00:47:52,135 --> 00:47:54,865
Yes, we'll get them.

292
00:49:13,016 --> 00:49:17,817
Hey! Over here! Help!

293
00:49:17,888 --> 00:49:22,154
We don't know who that is.
It could be poachers. Come on.

294
00:49:29,733 --> 00:49:32,133
They're gonna see our footprints.

295
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:39,969
I got an idea.
Take your clothes off.

296
00:50:43,573 --> 00:50:47,441
<i>No! Come here, Hintza!</i>

297
00:51:11,435 --> 00:51:17,340
Take some men, get down there,
and get rid of those bodies.

298
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:21,935
- This time, finish the job. You hear me?
- I hear you.

299
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:42,728
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's hear it for Harry Winslow! Hey!

300
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:52,235
Come on, let me hear you say it.
Say, "Harry, you're a genius. "

301
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:59,674
Come on, let me hear it!

302
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:09,217
It was Ricketts.

303
00:52:11,728 --> 00:52:16,188
- Ricketts?
- Yeah, Ricketts.

304
00:52:20,237 --> 00:52:22,728
My dad's friend.

305
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:28,973
- You mean the guy with the gun?
- In the plane with the gun.

306
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:37,476
- That means he's the one...
- Who killed our parents.

307
00:52:39,523 --> 00:52:41,684
And he killed Koba.

308
00:52:42,759 --> 00:52:47,924
Wait. He's the one
who's been exporting the ivory.

309
00:52:49,633 --> 00:52:51,931
Are you sure?

310
00:52:55,305 --> 00:52:57,671
Why did my dad trust him?

311
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:02,475
He should've known.

312
00:53:49,259 --> 00:53:52,092
I thought you said
it wasn't safe to have a fire.

313
00:53:52,162 --> 00:53:56,326
We're dead now.
We can have whatever we want.

314
00:54:07,344 --> 00:54:09,471
What you did with the dummies
was pretty smart.

315
00:54:09,546 --> 00:54:12,606
Yeah - smart for a guy, right?

316
00:54:14,384 --> 00:54:16,045
Ow.

317
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:27,457
So, what is this?

318
00:54:28,632 --> 00:54:30,793
Hand it over.

319
00:54:30,867 --> 00:54:32,892
It has my name in it.
I should be able to read it.

320
00:54:32,969 --> 00:54:35,130
- I don't write about you.
- My name is right here.

321
00:54:35,205 --> 00:54:39,198
<i>Give it back!</i>

322
00:54:40,243 --> 00:54:42,837
You shouldn't read
other people's journals.

323
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:51,346
Even someone brought up
in the bush should know about that.

324
00:54:56,393 --> 00:54:59,487
<i>Xhabbo's wife does this.</i>

325
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:05,598
<i>- For how long?
- Once, for a month.</i>

326
00:55:08,772 --> 00:55:12,208
- Nonnie worried?
- No.

327
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:23,145
- So when do you think he'll be back?
- Man always come back.

328
00:55:23,219 --> 00:55:26,279
Woman always wait.

329
00:55:50,914 --> 00:55:53,576
It's by your jacket.

330
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:09,028
So, you gonna be a writer or something?

331
00:56:11,901 --> 00:56:14,335
Or something.

332
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:21,170
Well, don't go off like that again.
Xhabbo was really worried.

333
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:55,394
- What's he doing?
- Getting water.

334
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:59,561
Here.

335
00:59:46,149 --> 00:59:49,141
Roots like water, too.

336
00:59:50,987 --> 00:59:54,923
- What is it?
- Food.

337
00:59:55,825 --> 00:59:57,417
Food.

338
01:00:05,802 --> 01:00:11,832
- So, how do you like it?
- It's right up there with your pâté.

339
01:00:16,012 --> 01:00:21,348
<i>So, how do you say "root" in Bushman?</i>

340
01:00:21,417 --> 01:00:23,681
How do you do that with your tongue?
That's amazing.

341
01:00:23,753 --> 01:00:26,017
Look.

342
01:00:26,089 --> 01:00:29,058
Two stars are walking
together in the sky.

343
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:35,086
<i>Those aren't stars, Xhabbo.
That's a satellite.</i>

344
01:00:35,164 --> 01:00:38,600
- Satellite?
- Yeah, a satellite.

345
01:00:40,069 --> 01:00:43,163
You know, television.
Broadcasting.

346
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:45,639
- Television?
- Yeah, television.

347
01:00:47,176 --> 01:00:51,977
See, it's this little box,
and then you turn it on,

348
01:00:52,048 --> 01:00:56,041
and you can see pictures
from all around the world.

349
01:00:58,521 --> 01:01:01,615
When they walked on the moon,
people all across the world saw it

350
01:01:01,691 --> 01:01:04,057
at the same time because of television.

351
01:01:08,698 --> 01:01:10,859
What's so funny?

352
01:01:15,605 --> 01:01:19,871
- Well, you tell him.
- You tell him how it works.

353
01:01:19,942 --> 01:01:24,436
Tell him how you put the moon
in that tiny, little box.

354
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:27,381
See, the moon in the box
isn't the real moon.

355
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:31,477
It's a pattern of light transformed
into electromagnetic waves.

356
01:01:37,427 --> 01:01:42,057
Look. It's like my Walkman, all right?
Only with pictures.

357
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:01,577
The batteries are dead.

358
01:02:15,665 --> 01:02:21,297
It's shrinking powder. It's magic shrinking
powder that shrinks the moon...

359
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:25,564
...down to the size of a baseball.

360
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:34,379
You know what a telephone is, eh?
There's this little man.

361
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:38,784
He's got really quick writing,
and he writes down everything you say.

362
01:03:17,527 --> 01:03:21,930
- Mountains?
- More dunes.

363
01:03:29,872 --> 01:03:34,832
Harry must not look back.
This is Harry's future.

364
01:04:03,739 --> 01:04:07,072
Mopani. These audits.

365
01:04:08,044 --> 01:04:10,035
What about them?

366
01:04:10,112 --> 01:04:12,945
They're a dead end.
It's been two months.

367
01:04:13,015 --> 01:04:16,314
You've found nothing, I've found nothing,
and neither have the police.

368
01:04:16,385 --> 01:04:18,148
You said last week
you were onto something.

369
01:04:18,221 --> 01:04:21,952
Some coffee merchants
trying to avoid export tax. Nothing.

370
01:04:22,024 --> 01:04:25,255
Nonnie was like my own daughter.
Are you telling me to give up?

371
01:04:25,328 --> 01:04:27,922
L"m telling you it wasn't
a corporate conspiracy.

372
01:04:27,997 --> 01:04:30,659
Paul and his family
were killed by poachers.

373
01:04:30,733 --> 01:04:33,566
It's taken you two months
to reach that conclusion?

374
01:04:33,636 --> 01:04:37,538
And how long are you going to
pursue this... the rest of your life?

375
01:04:37,607 --> 01:04:41,043
- If I have to, yes.
- Our friend is dead.

376
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:43,510
We buried him.
We've mourned him.

377
01:04:43,579 --> 01:04:47,811
I think it's about time
we got on with the business of living.

378
01:04:47,883 --> 01:04:53,378
I know that when I find the tusks,
I will find the killers.

379
01:04:54,457 --> 01:04:57,585
If they don't find you first.

380
01:04:57,660 --> 01:05:02,063
- Are you trying to tell me something?
- I don't want to lose another friend.

381
01:05:02,131 --> 01:05:07,899
<i>- Ready, Mopani.
- Don't worry. You won't.</i>

382
01:05:36,966 --> 01:05:40,197
<i>I'm gonna go
get some more wood.</i>

383
01:05:46,475 --> 01:05:50,639
- Harry has a wife?
- No. Are you kidding?

384
01:05:56,652 --> 01:05:59,712
Nonnie has no husband.

385
01:05:59,789 --> 01:06:02,223
Of course she doesn't.
She's too young.

386
01:06:05,995 --> 01:06:10,022
When Xhabbo was like Harry,
Xhabbo marry.

387
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:13,693
You got married when you were 16?

388
01:06:16,605 --> 01:06:19,836
When Bushman is ready,
Bushman marry.

389
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:25,940
She must be pretty.

390
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:30,717
<i>- Is she good-looking?
- You're wasting your time.</i>

391
01:06:30,786 --> 01:06:34,085
He doesn't have a clue what you're saying.

392
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:39,350
Bushmen never give each other
compliments about their looks.

393
01:06:39,428 --> 01:06:42,022
Well, they gotta think something.

394
01:06:42,098 --> 01:06:45,124
What did you think when you first saw me?

395
01:06:49,238 --> 01:06:51,706
I don't remember.

396
01:08:38,113 --> 01:08:43,710
Harry killed his first gemsbok.
Harry is a hunter now.

397
01:08:51,994 --> 01:08:54,622
Harry feeling bad.

398
01:08:55,397 --> 01:09:02,235
Gemsbok giving life
so Harry may be strong for journey.

399
01:09:08,143 --> 01:09:11,112
Yeah, well, you don't understand, Xhabbo.

400
01:09:13,182 --> 01:09:15,150
I killed him.

401
01:09:15,751 --> 01:09:20,415
Only kill for food.
Only kill when you must.

402
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:30,830
<i>The herd of gemsbok
have come back to our camp:</i>

403
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:37,669
<i>They're not afraid: Xhabbo says they've
accepted the death of one of them:</i>

404
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:41,005
<i>He says only to kill when you must:</i>

405
01:09:41,076 --> 01:09:45,012
<i>What would I do face to face
with the man who killed my father?</i>

406
01:09:50,452 --> 01:09:52,886
Oh, you found your stick.

407
01:09:55,491 --> 01:09:58,892
Are you gonna go get it? Fetch!

408
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:03,756
Go! Go get it!

409
01:10:05,801 --> 01:10:07,996
We're gonna eat that?

410
01:10:09,872 --> 01:10:12,102
It's Harry's gift.

411
01:10:13,075 --> 01:10:15,669
You're giving this to me?

412
01:10:17,012 --> 01:10:19,640
Harry's gift to Nonnie.

413
01:12:12,227 --> 01:12:14,252
What is it?

414
01:12:22,805 --> 01:12:27,003
It's beautiful. Is it for me?

415
01:12:27,476 --> 01:12:30,036
No, I made it for me.

416
01:12:30,112 --> 01:12:32,706
- You made it?
- Xhabbo showed me.

417
01:12:38,387 --> 01:12:40,321
You're so...

418
01:12:40,389 --> 01:12:43,881
- What?
- I don't know.

419
01:12:46,662 --> 01:12:51,122
- Well, go ahead. Try it on.
- Right here, now?

420
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:53,361
Why not?

421
01:12:54,636 --> 01:12:56,297
OK.

422
01:13:18,093 --> 01:13:21,460
- So, does it fit?
- Just a minute.

423
01:13:26,368 --> 01:13:28,233
OK.

424
01:13:42,885 --> 01:13:45,581
You're the most beautiful gemsbok
I've ever seen.

425
01:13:53,962 --> 01:13:57,955
When you went back...
to the house, I mean...

426
01:14:02,037 --> 01:14:04,403
did you actually see them?

427
01:14:06,642 --> 01:14:08,439
Yeah.

428
01:14:10,646 --> 01:14:13,479
I wish I hadn't seen them.

429
01:14:17,719 --> 01:14:20,051
When my mother died...

430
01:14:23,225 --> 01:14:26,023
my father wouldn't let me see her.

431
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:30,628
'Cause he thought it would be better.

432
01:14:36,405 --> 01:14:38,669
But it wasn't.

433
01:14:42,644 --> 01:14:45,704
'Cause for me it's never-ending.

434
01:14:51,620 --> 01:14:54,418
I still look for her sometimes.

435
01:15:32,594 --> 01:15:35,028
I miss my birds.

436
01:15:40,035 --> 01:15:43,300
Had them ever since I was really little.

437
01:15:48,543 --> 01:15:51,740
My mother put them in my room
to sing me to sleep.

438
01:15:56,652 --> 01:16:00,349
But I mostly think of hearing them
when I wake up in the morning.

439
01:16:03,659 --> 01:16:09,325
I know it's stupid,
but that's home to me.

440
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:14,794
Hearing them before
I even open my eyes.

441
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:39,591
Wildlife Commission.

442
01:16:39,661 --> 01:16:41,822
<i>Mopani Theron. Please: For John Ricketts:</i>

443
01:16:41,897 --> 01:16:43,125
He's in the air, sir.

444
01:16:43,198 --> 01:16:46,531
<i>- Really? Still looking?
- Yes. Sir:</i>

445
01:16:46,601 --> 01:16:48,762
Can you tell me
where he's looking today?

446
01:16:48,837 --> 01:16:53,206
<i>I'm afraid I can't tell you that. Sir:
Would you like to leave a message?</i>

447
01:16:53,275 --> 01:16:55,675
<i>No. Thank you:
That's all right:</i>

448
01:16:59,081 --> 01:17:01,515
That is the Shumba mine down there.

449
01:17:01,583 --> 01:17:05,451
<i>The Shumba mine
belongs to Ricketts. That's OK.</i>

450
01:17:36,284 --> 01:17:39,082
All right, all right, I'm coming.

451
01:17:41,857 --> 01:17:43,882
Here we go.

452
01:18:00,475 --> 01:18:02,875
<i>No, come!</i>

453
01:18:14,923 --> 01:18:18,757
Come back, you bastards!

454
01:18:25,434 --> 01:18:27,425
Run!

455
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,391
Over here!

456
01:19:27,062 --> 01:19:29,257
Harry!

457
01:19:30,098 --> 01:19:32,760
Aah!

458
01:19:56,258 --> 01:19:58,055
Grab my hand!

459
01:20:06,902 --> 01:20:09,462
Hintza!

460
01:20:14,676 --> 01:20:17,406
- Hintza! Jump!
- Jump, Hintza!

461
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:41,458
- Is he gonna be all right?
- Yeah.

462
01:20:41,536 --> 01:20:43,800
None of the wounds
are to the bone.

463
01:20:47,442 --> 01:20:49,433
Thank you.

464
01:20:51,479 --> 01:20:55,813
- For what?
- For catching Hintza.

465
01:21:22,911 --> 01:21:26,574
Larry. Right on time.

466
01:21:26,648 --> 01:21:29,947
- The shipment is ready?
- You have the letter of credit?

467
01:21:30,018 --> 01:21:34,819
As agreed. And now I would like
to inspect the merchandise.

468
01:21:35,290 --> 01:21:39,283
So you shall.
It's not far.

469
01:21:44,866 --> 01:21:51,772
Solid gold. It reads, uh, "Nonnie,"
but you can get that off.

470
01:21:55,210 --> 01:21:57,940
Where did you get this?

471
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:00,948
I bought it from a trader.

472
01:22:01,316 --> 01:22:04,114
Where did you get this?

473
01:22:05,587 --> 01:22:08,750
I found it. By the gorge.

474
01:22:08,823 --> 01:22:13,283
- When?
- Couple of days ago. You want it?

475
01:22:15,563 --> 01:22:21,559
I must apologize to you, Larry,
for bringing you all the way out here.

476
01:22:21,636 --> 01:22:24,230
There's a small matter I must attend to

477
01:22:24,306 --> 01:22:26,866
before I can allow you
to inspect the merchandise.

478
01:22:42,457 --> 01:22:46,826
Hey, man, what happened to Patel?
I thought he was coming with us.

479
01:22:46,895 --> 01:22:51,730
Those two kids in the desert. You
remember what I told you to do with them?

480
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:57,796
- Yeah. Go back and bury them.
- That's right. And did you do it?

481
01:22:57,872 --> 01:23:03,003
- Yeah, of course I did.
- Good. Good.

482
01:24:21,589 --> 01:24:26,788
This has got to be the last dune.
I can almost smell the ocean.

483
01:25:04,999 --> 01:25:07,365
It's just more dunes.

484
01:25:30,124 --> 01:25:32,786
Wind can do it, we can do it.

485
01:25:36,364 --> 01:25:39,197
Aah!

486
01:25:39,267 --> 01:25:41,292
Xhabbo!

487
01:25:48,743 --> 01:25:55,581
<i>Maybe Bushmen cross deserts:
Maybe they even make it:</i>

488
01:25:55,650 --> 01:25:58,619
<i>But we're gonna die here:</i>

489
01:25:58,686 --> 01:26:03,646
<i>All the wind will do for us
is bury us in the sand:</i>

490
01:26:24,612 --> 01:26:28,241
Take Harry.
Leave Xhabbo.

491
01:26:29,350 --> 01:26:36,552
As brothers,
we go together or we stop.

492
01:29:29,530 --> 01:29:31,430
Mopani?

493
01:29:48,382 --> 01:29:49,713
Harry?

494
01:30:25,419 --> 01:30:29,014
- Keep the damned thing steady!
- I can't hold it!

495
01:30:46,541 --> 01:30:50,773
- I said, keep the damned thing steady!
- I just can't! You understand?

496
01:30:54,849 --> 01:30:56,510
I'm losing control!

497
01:30:57,285 --> 01:31:01,654
- I'm getting out of here.
- Turn around! Get me down now.

498
01:31:47,602 --> 01:31:49,695
Nonnie!

499
01:33:07,782 --> 01:33:09,875
<i>Sebastian!</i>

500
01:33:11,953 --> 01:33:13,944
Sebastian!

501
01:33:14,889 --> 01:33:17,016
Sebastian, come on!

502
01:33:22,129 --> 01:33:24,723
Mommy! Mommy!

503
01:33:36,177 --> 01:33:38,509
<i>He'll be out in a couple of days.</i>

504
01:33:38,579 --> 01:33:42,037
It's just an allergic reaction
to the antibiotics.

505
01:33:43,017 --> 01:33:44,951
It's white man's medicine.

506
01:33:45,019 --> 01:33:47,852
You should go back
to your own ward now, young lady.

507
01:33:47,922 --> 01:33:50,015
I'm not going back, I'm going...

508
01:33:50,091 --> 01:33:55,358
Is this the young lady who
followed the wind across the Kalahari?

509
01:34:01,135 --> 01:34:05,333
I thought I was never
gonna see you again.

510
01:34:05,406 --> 01:34:08,136
Let me look at you.

511
01:34:11,779 --> 01:34:18,207
It's a miracle. A miracle, what you did.
What all of you did.

512
01:34:20,321 --> 01:34:23,017
- Did you get him?
- Get who?

513
01:34:23,124 --> 01:34:26,525
Ricketts.
It's John Ricketts.

514
01:34:28,829 --> 01:34:31,161
<i>Ricketts: John Ricketts:</i>

515
01:34:31,232 --> 01:34:35,362
<i>Also detain and inspect all small aircraft
attempting to leave the country:</i>

516
01:34:35,436 --> 01:34:39,167
Meet me at the Shumba gold mine.
Bring backup.

517
01:36:22,877 --> 01:36:25,038
Let's blow it up.

518
01:36:27,915 --> 01:36:29,849
Wait a second.

519
01:36:31,018 --> 01:36:36,388
These are corpses.
We have to bury them.

520
01:36:49,136 --> 01:36:53,038
- You're pretty good at this.
- I had a good teacher.

521
01:36:56,143 --> 01:36:59,135
<i>- I miss him.
- So do I.</i>

522
01:37:03,050 --> 01:37:05,780
Step back from the gun, Mopani.

523
01:37:40,821 --> 01:37:43,585
Nonnie, don't!

524
01:38:55,996 --> 01:38:58,590
You're mad!

525
01:38:59,533 --> 01:39:01,364
I can't let you do this!

526
01:39:02,569 --> 01:39:04,366
You did it all for nothing.

527
01:39:04,438 --> 01:39:10,274
There's millions of dollars worth
of ivory in there! You bloody fools!

528
01:39:10,344 --> 01:39:12,938
Ricketts, don't!
It's too late!

529
01:40:02,863 --> 01:40:06,856
- Will I see you again?
- Ask desert.

530
01:40:06,934 --> 01:40:09,926
Desert knows to find Xhabbo.

531
01:40:23,417 --> 01:40:28,081
We go together and now we stop.

532
01:40:32,192 --> 01:40:35,923
Xhabbo will not look back.

533
01:40:57,284 --> 01:41:02,517
Harry, you should go now,
or you will miss your plane.

534
01:41:02,589 --> 01:41:05,615
Yes, sir.
Thank you.

535
01:41:16,370 --> 01:41:20,431
- Goodbye, Nonnie.
- Goodbye, Harry Winslow.

536
01:41:23,076 --> 01:41:29,845
- You look different.
- Yeah, it's the tie. I look stupid in a tie.

537
01:41:31,485 --> 01:41:35,979
No, you don't look stupid.
You look nice.

538
01:42:10,157 --> 01:42:12,284
Don't look back.
