00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:39,741
You said there were
a few bumps.

308
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:43,912
Boy, I'll say. She folded like a kite
when she hit the runway.

309
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:47,499
We thought Cliffie's number
was up, with the fire and all.

310
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,674
I was gonna tell ya.

311
00:27:57,843 --> 00:27:59,928
I didn't want to ruin
your evening.

312
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:03,599
It's very thoughtful of you.
You'd rather make a fool of me?

313
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:07,102
I'm sorry.

314
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:10,397
I don't want you
to be sorry.

315
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:14,776
I want you to stop treating me
like... a stranger.

316
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:17,738
When something goes wrong,
I should be the first to know.

317
00:28:17,905 --> 00:28:20,699
I shouldn't be the last.

318
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:23,869
Everyone knows because
they were at the airfield.

319
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:28,165
I had an audition.

320
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:30,167
It was important to me.

321
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:32,502
I understand.

322
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:34,671
Just like the last time
when I flew the regionals.

323
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:38,258
You got a big part. You stood
behind Myrna Loy with a bowl of grapes.

324
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:44,389
Good night, Millie.
Thank you for the soup.

325
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,268
[Millie]
Well,

326
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:50,729
go after her,
you dope.

327
00:28:53,607 --> 00:28:55,567
Jenny!

328
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:02,991
[Sigh]

329
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:05,953
Cliff, I, uh --

330
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:10,582
- I'm sorry, I really stuck --
- Malcolm, it's okay.

331
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,126
It's not your fault.

332
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:36,149
- Did you have a good time?
- Yeah.

333
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:39,278
Go ahead and stick that
welding torch in my ear.

334
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:42,698
We'll call it the end
of a perfect day.

335
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:48,495
What're you two
scrappin' about this time?

336
00:29:48,662 --> 00:29:50,497
I don't know, Peev.

337
00:29:50,664 --> 00:29:52,833
I just can't figure
this girl out.

338
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,877
She hangs around with
this Hollywood crowd all day,

339
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:58,672
talkin' about movie stars
and nightclubs --

340
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:03,010
That's her work. She don't care about them
phoney-baloneys. She cares about you.

341
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:06,430
I want her to think
I'm makin' something of myself,

342
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:09,308
Not that I'm just
an out-of-work pilot.

343
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,685
You got a good thing
goin' with that girl.

344
00:30:11,852 --> 00:30:13,812
If she flies the coop,
I'm tellin' you...

345
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:17,441
it's gonna be
your fault.

346
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:20,235
What do you know
about women, Peev?

347
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:24,531
You haven't had a date
since 1932.

348
00:30:24,698 --> 00:30:27,326
Flora Maxwell.

349
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:31,788
There was no point
in datin' nobody after her.

350
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:49,473
[ Rooster Crowing ]

351
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,865
He's got to be kidding!

352
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:14,247
- [ Grunting]
- Ha, ha, ha.

353
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:26,176
What? Kill me as I stand?
I thought you were a sporting man.

354
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:30,889
True. I'd hate to stain my
legend on a villain such as you.

355
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:42,692
Prepare to die that we may learn
the identity of the Laughing Bandit.

356
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:46,738
- Why wait?
- [ Gasp ]

357
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,491
Good heavens!
It's Sir Reginald!

358
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,785
None other!

359
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:04,714
Oh, my prince,

360
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:07,509
would that you'd drink
of my lips as deeply.

361
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:12,722
Cut! Cut! Cut!
Back to first positions.

362
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:19,729
Good lord! How many times
are we gonna have to do this?

363
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:23,775
Sweetheart, acting is acting
like you're not acting.

364
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:28,238
- So act... but don't act like you're acting.
- All right.

365
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:35,579
Is she a block of wood!
Your audition was better.

366
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:39,791
Everybody's was better! Does it matter
when you're the producer's niece?

367
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:43,086
She gets a scene with Neville Sinclair
and we play scenery.

368
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:46,631
- I love Hollywood.
- Everybody, positions.

369
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,384
Let's try to get it
right this time.

370
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:52,804
"Laughing Bandit,"
scene 114, take 28.

371
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,390
[ Director]
And... action!

372
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:58,435
[ Sinclair]
Ha-ha-ha.

373
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:04,274
[ Sir Alec] What?
Kill me as I stand?

374
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:06,401
I thought you were
a sporting man.

375
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:10,655
[Sinclair] I'd hate to stain my legend
on a villain such as you.

376
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:16,411
[ Sir Alec] Prepare to die that we may learn
the identity of the Laughing Bandit.

377
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:20,457
- Why wait?
- It's Sir Reginald!

378
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:25,420
[ Sinclair]
None other.

379
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:33,261
Oh, my prince, would that
you'd drink of my lips as deeply.

380
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:42,437
[ Screaming ]

381
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:52,948
Excuse me. I'm looking
for Jenny Blake.

382
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:56,284
Oh, Jenny --
Jenny Blake.

383
00:33:56,451 --> 00:34:00,664
Does anyone know
a Jenny Blake?

384
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,290
Cut.

385
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,459
- I hope he's okay.
- Where's Mr. Sinclair?

386
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:06,795
Give us a hand
with this flat.

387
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:11,675
- You okay, Mr. Sinclair?
- I'm fine.

388
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:15,971
Never let it be said Neville Sinclair
failed to bring down the house.

389
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:19,975
Somebody call the nurse!
Charlie's been stabbed!

390
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:23,478
Charlie!

391
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:25,564
Charlie.

392
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,525
Forgive me, Charlie.
I had no idea.

393
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:31,570
Did you think I was
stealing the scene?

394
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:34,155
Don't talk.
Don't even move.

395
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:37,659
Get my car and driver.
Get him to The Queen of Angels.

396
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:40,745
Gladys, ride with him. <i>I'll</i> have
my personal physician meet you.

397
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:43,331
Victor, come here.

398
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:46,918
This is supposed to be
a closed set... no visitors!

399
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:50,672
I want that... Jenny
banned from the lot.

400
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:55,760
[ Cliff]
Jenny, I said I'm sorry.

401
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:59,014
- I just want to patch things up.
- You're off to a great start.

402
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:02,726
Something really big has happened
and I want you to be the first to know.

403
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:05,270
Me and Peevy
found something...

404
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:07,606
that's gonna get us
back on our feet.

405
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:11,192
- What do you mean, found something?
- It's an engine...

406
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,737
[ Cliff]
but you strap it to your back...

407
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:16,531
and it makes you fly
without wings.

408
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:20,702
[Jenny] You knocked down half
the castle to tell me about an engine?

409
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:23,246
You're always saying
you're the last to know.

410
00:35:23,413 --> 00:35:26,458
Cliff, I meant
the important things.

411
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:29,377
- This is important.
- So is this acting job.

412
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:32,047
- Acting?
- Yes, acting.

413
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:34,758
Honey, you're walking
through the scenery.

414
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:37,093
That's not fair.
This is a good job.

415
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,304
The director thinks
I'm talented.

416
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:41,473
What's this?

417
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,975
Pay voucher. The director
wants you off the picture.

418
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:47,437
- You know this is a closed set.
- I have to go.

419
00:35:47,604 --> 00:35:50,440
Come on. You know
what a closed set means?

420
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:05,288
Hey!

421
00:36:28,478 --> 00:36:32,607
- Where's that girl I told you to fire?
- I fired her.

422
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:45,120
Hello.
I'm Neville Sinclair.

423

- You must be--
- Jenny Blake.

424
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:54,629
I -- I'd hate to think...

425
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:58,800
that I may have been -- I'm responsible
for your having been dismissed.

426
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:03,221
- Will you stay?
- But it's... really my fault.

427
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:08,393
Have you read for the part
of the Saxon princess?

428
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,478
No.

429
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:13,732
I think you might be
wonderful in the role.

430
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:17,485
<i>I'll</i> see that you do. Perhaps
we could discuss it over dinner.

431
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:21,406
I've got a table at the South Seas Club
if you're not too bored with the club.

432
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:25,744
- I'd love to Mr.--

433

- Neville.
- Tonight then.

434
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:33,209
[ Director] Let's get all the
atmosphere over here.

We have clocked him at
192 miles per hour.

Programs! Five cents!

440
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:59,903
- Here you are.

00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:08,745
[Announcer] As you can see,
Miss Los Angeles is trailing badly.

444
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:10,789
She was down with some
mechanical problems...

445
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:14,959
- and she may be in trouble.
- Park it away from the runway.

446
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:17,587
- What's wrong with that kid? I told him 9:00.
- He'll be here.

447
00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:20,048
If he ain't in the air
in 5 minutes, find a new hangar.

[Announcer]
Howard in the Great Lakes Biplane...

449
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:27,222
is really pouring it on...
runnin' 3rd but movin'!

450
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:29,641
This could end up
in a three-way heat.

451
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:33,812
I know what Wilmer told Sinclair's goon,
but the rocket ain't in hangar three.

452
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:37,315
There's an old plane
but the only thing in it was this.

453
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:39,609
- That's it?
- We searched this place

454
00:38:39,776 --> 00:38:41,152
from hell to breakfast.

455
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:44,572
I want you to start over.
turn it inside out, upside down.

Keep your eyes open
for this dame.
