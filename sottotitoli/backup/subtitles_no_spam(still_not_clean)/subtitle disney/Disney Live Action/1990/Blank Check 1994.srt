00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,420
Where are you?

2
00:01:59,514 --> 00:02:03,894
Oh. Hello, beautiful.

[Kissing Sound]

4
00:02:05,896 --> 00:02:08,733
Did you miss me?

5
00:02:20,204 --> 00:02:23,081
Dad, I've given this
some thought...

6
00:02:23,081 --> 00:02:27,921
and I've decided that since Damien
and Ralph have their own rooms,

7
00:02:27,921 --> 00:02:32,426
well, there's no reason why they should
be bringing their junk into my room.

8
00:02:32,426 --> 00:02:34,471
Well, how does that
sound, Helen?

- [Gulping]
- [Door Opening]

10
00:02:38,141 --> 00:02:41,351
- Out of the way, stick boy!
- Hand & Foot is here to stay.

11
00:02:41,351 --> 00:02:43,813
- Oops, kicked your baby monkey.
- Get out of here, Ralph!

12
00:02:43,813 --> 00:02:47,860
- Here, take this.
- Go away, Damien. This is my room.

13
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,780
Was. Now it's also the world
headquarters of Hand & Foot, Incorporated.

14
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,532
- Hand & Foot all the way!
- Hand & Foot, Hand & Foot, Hand & Foot!

15
00:02:53,532 --> 00:02:58,705
- Hand & Foot? You guys aren't gonna make a dime.
- Okay, we'll use this.

16
00:02:58,705 --> 00:03:01,207
- Yeah!
- Hey, that's my life savings!

17
00:03:01,207 --> 00:03:04,378
- Consider yourself our silent partner.
- Yeah, say something and you're dead.

18
00:03:04,378 --> 00:03:06,545
- Yeah.
- How's the big move going?

19
00:03:06,545 --> 00:03:08,550
- Great.
- Good.

20
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,886
Come on, Ralph.
Gotta get to work.

21
00:03:10,886 --> 00:03:13,679
Dad?
[Clears Throat]

22
00:03:13,679 --> 00:03:14,429
Dad...

23
00:03:16,182 --> 00:03:19,060
well, I've given this
a lot of thought,

24
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,062
and I've decided that...

25
00:03:21,062 --> 00:03:24,065
- s-s-since Damien and Ralph have their own room...
- Preston,

26
00:03:24,065 --> 00:03:25,943
they need the space
for their business.

27
00:03:25,943 --> 00:03:29,405
- Not my space.
- Young man, in this family, industry gets rewarded.

28
00:03:29,405 --> 00:03:31,658
While you're in here playing,
your brothers are hard at work.

29
00:03:31,658 --> 00:03:35,246
- Yeah, kissin' butt for money.
- [Ralph] Well, you know the golden rule.

30
00:03:35,246 --> 00:03:38,915
- He who has the gold makes the rules.
- One day you'll have a job.

31
00:03:38,915 --> 00:03:43,755
- When I was your age, I had my own business cleaning wheels.
- [Mimicking Dad]

32
00:03:43,755 --> 00:03:46,925
I was pulling down 100 bucks a week
polishing cars.

33
00:03:46,925 --> 00:03:51,637
- You used to say 75.
- Well, you gotta think big, Preston.

34
00:03:51,637 --> 00:03:54,390
- Surprise.
- [Brothers] Whoa, check it out.

35
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,768
Yeah, it's for your business.
We had a spare at the office.

36
00:03:56,768 --> 00:03:59,730
- Damien, the speakers are out in the hall.
- How does it work?

37
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:02,733
It imitates human intelligence,
like you guys.

38
00:04:02,733 --> 00:04:05,612
- Preston, maybe you could teach your brothers how to use it.
- Not possible.

39
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:09,699
[Dad] The software will teach you how to
do everything but make love to a woman.

40
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:12,701
- Now I know what programme to get your father for Christmas.
- Mom!

41
00:04:12,701 --> 00:04:15,998
- Oops! Uh, here. Let me help you with that.
- Preston, you're gonna be late...

42
00:04:15,998 --> 00:04:19,628
- for Butch's birthday party.
- Who wants to celebrate Butch's birth?

43
00:04:19,628 --> 00:04:22,087
- [Dad] It's important to get out of your room more.
- [Brothers] Our room.

44
00:04:22,087 --> 00:04:24,632
Well, good luck, guys.

00:04:24,632 --> 00:04:27,843
[Computer Beeps, Talks]
Damien and Ralph sleep...

butt to face, butt to face,

47
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,142
- butt to face,
- Huh? - Who said that?

48
00:04:33,142 --> 00:04:36,353
- Butt to face, butt to face,
- Type "Quit." Hit "Delete."

49
00:04:36,353 --> 00:04:40,692
- Butt to face, butt to face, butt to face...
- Turn it off! Pull the plug!

50
00:04:42,194 --> 00:04:44,903
- Ow!
- Don't rub it. Be a man.

51
00:04:44,903 --> 00:04:49,576
- [Moaning] Ouch!
- Little wimp.

52
00:04:52,537 --> 00:04:57,209
[Dad] Come on, Preston. You don't want
to be late for Butch's birthday party.

53
00:04:57,209 --> 00:04:59,754
- Are you gonna have fun today?
- [Preston] How can I, Dad?

54
00:04:59,754 --> 00:05:02,631
- I don't have any money.
- Now, look. Here's a couple of bucks.

55
00:05:02,631 --> 00:05:04,719
Ah, heck, you can have fun
all day on that.

56
00:05:04,719 --> 00:05:07,512
You don't get out much,
do you, Dad?

57
00:05:07,512 --> 00:05:11,224
[P.A.] Welcome to Fun Land.
Fun, fun, fun for everyone.

Welcome to Fun Land.
Fun, fun, fun for everyone.

- Tokens!

- Give me 50. It's my birthday.
- Fifty.

00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,886
- Twenty-five, please.
- Twenty-five.

00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:45,136
- Twenty-seven.
- Twenty-seven.

- Six, please.
- Six.

Hey, Preston! Hey, over here!

77
00:06:55,422 --> 00:06:58,927
- Hey, Preston, how's your ostrich?
- Watch out!

78
00:06:58,927 --> 00:07:01,637
Preston has an ostrich!

79
00:07:01,637 --> 00:07:05,852
Hey, Preston,
come with us!

00:07:26,373 --> 00:07:29,876
[Dad] Did you have fun
at Butch's birthday party?

83
00:07:29,876 --> 00:07:32,713
I have a question.
Are we broke?

84
00:07:32,713 --> 00:07:35,549
- No, we just have to watch our spending habits.
- That's right.

85
00:07:35,549 --> 00:07:39,720
Like when your mother calls her sister
back East and talks for 97 minutes.

86
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,725
So if we're not
poverty-stricken,

87
00:07:42,725 --> 00:07:45,059
there must be some other
reason I'm so deprived.

88
00:07:45,059 --> 00:07:48,397
- We're outta here! Whoo!
- Goin' to the ball game.

89
00:07:48,397 --> 00:07:51,108
- Can I go?
- We bought tickets, toad.

90
00:07:51,108 --> 00:07:53,402
- [Mother] Damien!
- You need some cash?

91
00:07:53,402 --> 00:07:56,155
- Nah, we got a bunch of change.
- Later, Preston.

92
00:07:56,155 --> 00:07:59,242
It's not fair.
Why can't I have anything?

93
00:07:59,242 --> 00:08:01,954
Well, Preston, they have jobs,
and they've learned to save.

94
00:08:01,954 --> 00:08:04,247
How can I save money
if I don't have any?

95
00:08:04,247 --> 00:08:06,874
A penny saved
is a penny earned.

96
00:08:06,874 --> 00:08:09,379
- What do you want for your birthday?
- Money...

97
00:08:09,379 --> 00:08:12,215
so I can pay to have Ralph
and Damien knocked off.

98
00:08:12,215 --> 00:08:14,592
Anything else?

99
00:08:14,592 --> 00:08:17,345
Well, maybe we'll give him
one of his birthday presents early.

100
00:08:17,345 --> 00:08:20,390
A gift came
from Grandma today.

101
00:08:26,731 --> 00:08:31,611
Hmm. What a rip-off!
It's a cheque for nothing!

102
00:08:33,948 --> 00:08:36,283
I'm having a bad day.

103
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:39,286
Oh, your grandma just forgot
to fill in how much it was for,

104
00:08:39,286 --> 00:08:42,039
but she signed it
at the bottom, see?

105
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:46,168
It's a blank cheque.

106
00:08:46,168 --> 00:08:49,297
- We'll just fill in the amount.
- How much did you get last year, honey?

107
00:08:49,297 --> 00:08:52,217
A thousand.

108
00:08:52,217 --> 00:08:54,512
- Ten dollars.
- Wait, Dad. What about inflation?

109
00:08:54,512 --> 00:08:57,599
- Oh, make it 11.
- [Muttering]

110
00:08:57,599 --> 00:09:00,475
You'd be surprised how fast...

111
00:09:00,475 --> 00:09:03,311
eleven dollars can grow
with interest.

112
00:09:05,149 --> 00:09:08,151
Preston?
Preston?

113
00:09:08,151 --> 00:09:10,862
[Preston]
Eleven dollars...

114
00:09:10,862 --> 00:09:15,158
at 3.45 interest.

115
00:09:15,158 --> 00:09:18,579
[Computer]
Your account will reach...

116
00:09:18,579 --> 00:09:20,705
one million dollars...

117
00:09:20,705 --> 00:09:25,003
in 342,506 years.

118
00:09:25,003 --> 00:09:27,714
I'm stuck here forever.

119
00:09:27,714 --> 00:09:30,551
- [Dad] Lights out up there.
- Why?

120
00:09:30,551 --> 00:09:32,553
My house, my rules.

121
00:09:32,553 --> 00:09:35,721
"My house, my rules."

122
00:09:38,017 --> 00:09:39,643
My own house.

00:09:47,694 --> 00:09:50,697

125
00:10:11,221 --> 00:10:13,597
[Man]
Dave, who needs assets? I'm your asset.

126
00:10:13,597 --> 00:10:15,766
- I'm a big asset. Oh, c...
- [Man On Phone] I can't believe you.

127
00:10:15,766 --> 00:10:19,104
Dave, Dave. Come on, come on.
Why only borrow 150,000?

128
00:10:19,104 --> 00:10:21,440
Our money is your money.
Round it off to two.

129
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,191
- Do I qualify?
- Of course you qualify for the loan, Dave.

130
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:26,947
We're golf partners.

131
00:10:28,781 --> 00:10:31,283
- You don't look happy to see me.
- Quig...

132
00:10:31,283 --> 00:10:33,453
- Quigley.
- Quigley.

133
00:10:33,453 --> 00:10:35,621
That's funny. I don't remember you
stuttering on the witness stand.

134
00:10:35,621 --> 00:10:37,748
- You just sang like a bird, didn't you?
- I had no choice, Carl.

135
00:10:37,748 --> 00:10:40,209
- I mean, lying in court...
- You also pointed at me.

136
00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:42,545
- That hurt.
- Well, I was under oath.

137
00:10:42,545 --> 00:10:45,799
- I mean...
- Come here.

138
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:47,802
The only reason
you're alive, Biderman,

139
00:10:47,802 --> 00:10:50,888
is I knew I might need you
again someday... like today.

140
00:10:50,888 --> 00:10:53,724
Oh, sure. You need a loan?
The rates are great now.

141
00:10:53,724 --> 00:10:56,852
- And you get a toaster.
- I don't need a toaster.

142
00:10:58,522 --> 00:11:03,318
Before I went away, I put
aside a little nest egg.

143
00:11:07,364 --> 00:11:10,952
[Gasping] These bills,
they're marked consecutively.

144
00:11:10,952 --> 00:11:13,787
- They'd trace these in a minute.
- That's right.

145
00:11:13,787 --> 00:11:17,460
- [Coughing]
- That's where you come in, old buddy. I want new bills.

146
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:21,463
- We're back in the S&L business, Biderman.
- Ah, money laundering...

147
00:11:21,463 --> 00:11:24,132
- is very difficult these days, Carl.
- You still do it though, don't you?

148
00:11:24,132 --> 00:11:26,135
That's a good-looking family
right there.

149
00:11:26,135 --> 00:11:28,304
You're not gonna
hurt them, are you?

150
00:11:28,304 --> 00:11:30,639
- Hate to have to.
- All right.

151
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:32,643
How do you want
to do this?

152
00:11:32,643 --> 00:11:35,103
- I'll send my guy in tomorrow with a cheque for a million.
- Tomorrow?

153
00:11:35,103 --> 00:11:38,899
Yep, just like the old days. You give him
the cash, unmarked, send him on his way.

154
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:40,984
- Whom should I expect?
- Whom should...

155
00:11:40,984 --> 00:11:43,278
Whom should you expect?
His name is Juice.

156
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:46,365
- Juice?
- Mmm, he'll be here in exactly 24 hours.

...your house.
- [Computer Beeps]

335
00:26:45,517 --> 00:26:48,896
I'd like to make
a cash offer on your house.

336
00:26:48,896 --> 00:26:51,524
Someone else
wants to make an offer.

337
00:26:51,524 --> 00:26:54,027
What?
On this dump?

338
00:26:54,027 --> 00:26:56,946
- Uh, hello, sir. Can you hear me?
- Who is this yo-yo?

- [Computer] One-sixty.
- What kind of hustle is this?

341
00:27:02,786 --> 00:27:05,455
And what's with
your voice, pal?

342
00:27:08,083 --> 00:27:11,462
Sore throat-itis.
[Computer Coughs]

343
00:27:11,462 --> 00:27:16,926
Yeah. I'll tell you what. One-seventy
right now, cash, and I walk away.

344
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:19,888
- You take it or leave it right now.
- Ask the box.

345
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:25,562
One-eighty,
plus closing costs.

346
00:27:25,562 --> 00:27:27,647
- One-eighty,
- [Preston] Top that, sucker.

347
00:27:27,647 --> 00:27:30,650
Plus closing costs.

348
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:33,152
- One-ninety, darlin'. Top that.
- Preston, honey?

349
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:35,656
I have a few errands to run.
I'll be back by 2:00.

00:27:35,656 --> 00:27:37,657
Okay. Bye, Mom.

- Two-ten.

352
00:27:44,206 --> 00:27:46,835
- Just to be safe, make that 3:00.
- [Laughs]

353
00:27:46,835 --> 00:27:50,130
- Three hundred?
- Ma, you're killin' me on this deal.

354
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:52,173
Come on. Are you tellin' me
we're gonna sit here and listen...

355
00:27:52,173 --> 00:27:54,759
to some talking box
with a robot voice? What is this?

356
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:58,848
Uh, 300 it is. Are you
prepared to top 300?

357
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:01,432
No, I don't think I'm prepared
to top 300! Are you out of your mind?

358
00:28:01,432 --> 00:28:05,312
We had a deal here! Are you Realtors
just a bunch of crooks? Is that it?

359
00:28:05,312 --> 00:28:07,315
What's going on
with you people?

360
00:28:07,315 --> 00:28:09,610
Well, I am sorry
you feel that way,

361
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:11,944
but I have an offer
on the table of 300.

362
00:28:11,944 --> 00:28:14,491
- [Computer] Thousand.
- Uh, we'll take it.

363
00:28:14,491 --> 00:28:17,242
- Sold.
- Yeah.

364
00:28:17,242 --> 00:28:20,246
You probably won't live
to enjoy the cash.

00:28:22,497 --> 00:28:25,125
[Realtor] Just one thing, sir.
What is your name?

366
00:28:25,125 --> 00:28:29,631
My name is Preston...

367
00:28:38,182 --> 00:28:38,932

Money!

377
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:19,018
- You did what with my money?
- [Juice] You're not gonna believe this.

378
00:29:19,018 --> 00:29:23,481
He gave all your money
to a little old bitty boy.

379
00:29:23,481 --> 00:29:26,277
That was my nest egg.
That's all I had to start a new life.

380
00:29:26,277 --> 00:29:28,821
I worked hard to steal
that money, Biderman!

381
00:29:28,821 --> 00:29:30,948
You gave it to some
zit-faced little kid?

382
00:29:30,948 --> 00:29:33,326
Now wait a minute.
I seen the kid.

383
00:29:33,326 --> 00:29:36,829
- His skin looked pretty smooth.
- The boy had a cheque signed by you.

384
00:29:36,829 --> 00:29:39,457
I didn't write a cheque to anybody
except for this genius here.

385
00:29:39,457 --> 00:29:41,501
Now hold on a minute.

386
00:29:41,501 --> 00:29:43,629
I'm not the one who cashed
a cheque for a million dollars.

387
00:29:43,629 --> 00:29:46,132
- That was this man right here.
- Had your signature.

388
00:29:46,132 --> 00:29:48,593
I said I didn't write it!
You gave me the cheque-book,

389
00:29:48,593 --> 00:29:52,513
I put it in my pocket,
I got in my car, l...

390
00:29:52,513 --> 00:29:56,686
l... I can't
feel my legs.

391
00:29:56,686 --> 00:29:59,814
Uh, l...
Oh, oh, oh.

392
00:29:59,814 --> 00:30:04,360
Calm down. I've got
a surveillance photo of the boy.

393
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,862
[Stammering]
We'll find him in no time.

394
00:30:06,862 --> 00:30:08,864
- Oh, yeah, that's him.
- I can't see a thing.

395
00:30:08,864 --> 00:30:11,368
I recognize him.
I'd know him anywhere.

396
00:30:11,368 --> 00:30:13,370
It's upside-down.

397
00:30:18,668 --> 00:30:23,840
All right. So where are you
gonna find the kid, Mr Family Man?

398
00:30:25,676 --> 00:30:29,638
- Newspapers.
- You want me to advertise, is that it?

399
00:30:29,638 --> 00:30:31,891
No, no, no.
They have listings.

400
00:30:31,891 --> 00:30:37,062
Uh, family activities where, where...
You know, things where kids go. See?

401
00:30:37,062 --> 00:30:40,232
Fine. You're gonna
help me find him.

402
00:30:40,232 --> 00:30:44,070
- You understand? Dead or alive.
- Uh-huh.

403
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:46,155
Let's get out of here.

404
00:30:47,907 --> 00:30:50,285
- Oh, don't think you ain't comin' with us.
- [Gasping]

405
00:30:52,371 --> 00:30:56,291
Somebody's in there
with Biderman now.

406
00:30:56,291 --> 00:30:59,295
A couple of guys I've never seen before.
They've just left.

407
00:30:59,295 --> 00:31:01,338
The money laundering
is definitely on again.

408
00:31:01,338 --> 00:31:03,926
We've got to notify
the Bureau right away.

411
00:31:14,312 --> 00:31:17,023

Sorry, kid.
Nobody famous inside.

415
00:31:40,882 --> 00:31:43,135
Do you want to take your mitts
off the car, please?

416
00:31:43,135 --> 00:31:46,138
- I'm waitin' for a client here.
- But I'm your client.

417

Oh, right, yeah.
And I'm Madonna.

418
00:31:49,642 --> 00:31:52,228
Sorry, kid. The boss doesn't like me
taking baseball cards as payment.

419
00:31:52,228 --> 00:31:54,938

you need some buckaroos, buckarinis,

some moola, some dinero,
some money, some frogskins,

421
00:31:58,068 --> 00:32:00,070
much similar to the money
you've given me...

422
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:02,489
In fact, identical to the money
you've given me right now.

423
00:32:02,489 --> 00:32:04,701
I was just kiddin'
about bein' Madonna.

00:32:20,552 --> 00:32:21,845
So, where to,

Uh, Macintosh.
Yeah, yeah.

470
00:34:41,873 --> 00:34:44,875
If you don't mind me askin',
where does he get his money?

471
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:48,045
Well, he doesn't get it,
he just has it.

472
00:34:48,045 --> 00:34:51,757
Why does he get a kid like you to go out
and buy all this stuff for him?

473
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:54,387
He... He never
had a real childhood.

474
00:34:54,387 --> 00:34:57,556
So now that he's
really, really rich,

475
00:34:57,556 --> 00:35:01,394
he can have all the fun
that he couldn't have when he was a kid.

476
00:35:01,394 --> 00:35:04,521
- Oh. Oh, I see.
- You know.

477
00:35:04,521 --> 00:35:07,234
So he didn't have any
fun when he was a kid,

478
00:35:07,234 --> 00:35:09,235
but now he's old
and he's got money.

479
00:35:09,235 --> 00:35:11,362
You're a kid having
the fun for him now...

480
00:35:11,362 --> 00:35:13,531
that he couldn't have
when he was a kid.

481
00:35:13,531 --> 00:35:16,994
- Okay, sure.
- Stop! Pull over, Henry! It's Shay!

482
00:35:16,994 --> 00:35:19,662
- Stop! Hey!
- [Shay Screams] You scared me!

483
00:35:19,662 --> 00:35:23,209
- Sorry.
- Preston, right?

484
00:35:23,209 --> 00:35:25,712
- You've got a good memory.
- Thanks.

485
00:35:25,712 --> 00:35:28,215
- Great, kid. Very nice.
- Nice wheels.

486
00:35:28,215 --> 00:35:32,009
Oh, this? Ah, it's my boss,
Mr Macintosh.

487
00:35:32,009 --> 00:35:36,139
- Do you want a ride?
- No, thanks. I'm outta shape.

488
00:35:36,139 --> 00:35:38,100
Not from where
I'm sittin' you aren't.

489
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:41,395
So, uh, I'm thinkin' about
comin' into the bank tomorrow...

490
00:35:41,395 --> 00:35:45,067
- and opening my account.
- Wow, you got the $200 already?

491
00:35:45,067 --> 00:35:49,363
- Just about.
- All right. Well, see you tomorrow.

492
00:35:49,363 --> 00:35:52,324
- Bye.
- Bye.

493
00:35:58,038 --> 00:35:59,916
Was that him?
Was that Biderman?

494
00:35:59,916 --> 00:36:03,503
- No, some kid who came into the bank today.
- Nice wheels for a kid.

495
00:36:03,503 --> 00:36:06,339
Yeah. Says it belongs to his boss,
a guy named Macintosh.

496
00:36:06,339 --> 00:36:09,927
Macintosh.
When are we gonna see Biderman?

497
00:36:13,472 --> 00:36:16,100
[Man]
It looks like a circus.

498
00:36:24,317 --> 00:36:28,197
Hey. Hey, hey, move it.
I've got work to do too, you know.

499
00:36:28,197 --> 00:36:31,700
Where am I supposed to go?
You see an opening? Huh?

500
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,702
Hey, what's
the holdup here?

501
00:36:33,702 --> 00:36:36,456
- Yeah, same to you, buddy.
- Hey, move it!

502
00:36:36,456 --> 00:36:39,209
What is all this?

503
00:36:39,209 --> 00:36:41,210
What a mess.

504
00:36:43,172 --> 00:36:45,716
This is absolute madness!

505
00:36:48,009 --> 00:36:49,929
Yo, who's in charge here?

506
00:36:52,056 --> 00:36:55,726
[Preston Over Speaker] You with
the race car, put it in the backyard.

507
00:36:55,726 --> 00:36:59,230
Uh, the water slide
goes back by the pool.

508
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:02,859
You guys with the TVs,
put them in the living room.

509
00:37:02,859 --> 00:37:06,238
Hey, you with the Cadillac,
out by the pool.

510
00:37:06,238 --> 00:37:09,158
You in the green jumpsuits,
bring that around the back.

511
00:37:09,158 --> 00:37:11,578
- Preston?
- Hi, Dad.

512
00:37:11,578 --> 00:37:14,290
- What's going on here?
- Movin' in.

513
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:17,459
- Who is moving in?
- Macintosh.

514
00:37:17,459 --> 00:37:20,421
- Who's Macintosh?
- I'll be right with you, Dad.

515
00:37:20,421 --> 00:37:23,548
Come on, boys.
I don't have all day.

516
00:37:23,548 --> 00:37:26,718
Okay, Mr Waters,
the security system is all in place.

517
00:37:26,718 --> 00:37:28,721
Excuse me.
This is the remote.

518
00:37:28,721 --> 00:37:30,724
Here are the instructions.
All right?

519
00:37:30,724 --> 00:37:33,561
We appreciate Mr Macintosh's business.
Here you go, pal.

520
00:37:33,561 --> 00:37:35,896
What's with
all the security?

521
00:37:35,896 --> 00:37:38,899
Mr Macintosh says you can
never be too paranoid, Dad.

522
00:37:38,899 --> 00:37:43,572
- Well, who is Macintosh?
- I work for him. He's paying me.

523
00:37:43,572 --> 00:37:45,573
Yeah, but who is he?
I never met him.

524
00:37:45,573 --> 00:37:49,077
- You mean you haven't met him?
- No, I haven't met him.

525
00:37:49,077 --> 00:37:51,578
- He's heard about you.
- Really?

526
00:37:51,578 --> 00:37:54,752
Yeah, about work and stuff.
Really good things.

527
00:37:54,752 --> 00:38:00,089
- Well... His stuff is blocking our driveway.
- Dad.

528
00:38:00,089 --> 00:38:01,393
Boys!

529
00:38:03,677 --> 00:38:06,638
Could you clear a path,
please?

530
00:38:06,638 --> 00:38:09,766
Get a move on it!

531
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:14,814
All set, Dad.

532
00:38:16,398 --> 00:38:18,443
"I knew a guy who was tough
but sweet"

533
00:38:18,443 --> 00:38:21,195
[Henry]
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

534
00:38:21,195 --> 00:38:25,366
"He's the one
He can't be beat"

535
00:38:25,366 --> 00:38:29,663
"He's got everything
that I desire"

536
00:38:29,663 --> 00:38:33,918
- "Sets the summer sun on fire"
- Brake, brake!

537
00:38:33,918 --> 00:38:37,214
"I want candy"

538
00:38:39,091 --> 00:38:43,345
- "I want candy"
- Flip, flip, flip, flip, flip!

539
00:38:43,345 --> 00:38:45,264
- "Yeah"
- [Game] Body blow. Uppercut.

540
00:38:45,264 --> 00:38:48,392
- Body blow. Left hook. Uppercut. Body blow.
- Ow.

541
00:38:48,392 --> 00:38:52,229
- Uppercut.
- Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!

542
00:38:52,229 --> 00:38:54,983
Body blow.
Ten, nine...

543
00:38:54,983 --> 00:38:57,485
- "I want candy"
- Yeah! Yes!

544
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:04,035
"I want candy"

545
00:39:04,035 --> 00:39:06,996
"Go to see him
when the sun goes down"

546
00:39:06,996 --> 00:39:11,168
- Come on, Henry! Come on!
- "Ain't no finer boy in town"

547
00:39:11,168 --> 00:39:14,043
- Hey! Whoa!
- "I want candy"

548
00:39:14,043 --> 00:39:18,842
- Oh, Henry!
- "I want candy"

549
00:39:18,842 --> 00:39:23,514
- The blood rushed to my head.
- "Hey"

550
00:39:23,514 --> 00:39:25,514
"Hey"

551
00:39:25,514 --> 00:39:27,518
"Hey"

552
00:39:27,518 --> 00:39:28,770
"Hey, hey"

553
00:39:33,192 --> 00:39:35,026
[Woman]
Is something wrong?

554
00:39:35,026 --> 00:39:37,863
No. I was wondering who could spend
cash like that these days.

555
00:39:37,863 --> 00:39:40,032
Oh, yeah.
The man's name is Macintosh.

556
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:42,869
- Macintosh?
- Mm-hmm. He just moved here.

557
00:39:42,869 --> 00:39:45,913
- Apparently loaded.
- Apparently.

558
00:39:45,913 --> 00:39:49,709
I don't feel good about being here.
People may get the wrong idea.

559
00:39:49,709 --> 00:39:51,710
Really?
You don't feel good?

560
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:53,881
How do you think I felt when you
gave away my million dollars, huh?

561
00:39:53,881 --> 00:39:56,718
Juice. See anybody
that looks like him?

562
00:39:56,718 --> 00:40:01,347
Oh, yeah. He looks like him.
Uh, she looks like him right there.

563
00:40:01,347 --> 00:40:05,018
Way back over there,
uh, there goes his little twin brother.

564
00:40:05,018 --> 00:40:08,397
You give me one picture and expect me
to find him out of all these kids?

565
00:40:08,397 --> 00:40:11,901
You must be crazy. I'm gonna get on
the water slide. I'm startin' to sweat.

566
00:40:11,901 --> 00:40:14,068
Hey, mister, you know
where the refreshment stands are?

567
00:40:14,068 --> 00:40:16,071
- [Pops Balloon]
- No.

568
00:40:16,071 --> 00:40:18,115
[Girl Crying]

569
00:40:18,115 --> 00:40:21,411
Boom, boom, boom!
I got you!

570
00:40:21,411 --> 00:40:23,829
Boom, boom,
boom, boom!

571
00:40:23,829 --> 00:40:24,872
[Electronic Gunfire]

572
00:40:31,379 --> 00:40:34,216
- [Butch Whimpering]
- He says he knows you, boss.

573
00:40:34,216 --> 00:40:36,845
Oh, well, just throw him out.

574
00:40:36,845 --> 00:40:38,806
[Screaming]
Ow! Ow!

575
00:40:38,806 --> 00:40:43,893
- Banzai!
- "I want candy"

576
00:40:43,893 --> 00:40:47,397
- [Preston Screaming]
- "I want candy"

577
00:40:49,524 --> 00:40:51,443
"Hey"

578
00:40:51,443 --> 00:40:53,779
"Hey"

579
00:40:53,779 --> 00:40:56,657
- "Hey"
- Hiya.

580
00:40:56,657 --> 00:40:58,827
I didn't expect
to see you here.

581
00:40:58,827 --> 00:41:03,040
- Oh, what you doin' here?
- I came by to see Mr Macintosh.

582
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:07,127
- Oh, no, he's in a meeting.
- That's okay, I'll wait. I just really need to see him.

583
00:41:07,127 --> 00:41:09,462
- He's in meetings all day.
- All day?

584
00:41:09,462 --> 00:41:12,425
- Swamped.
- Hey, I missed you at the bank.

585
00:41:12,425 --> 00:41:15,762
I thought you were gonna come by
and see me about opening up an account.

586
00:41:15,762 --> 00:41:20,099
- Oh, I had to work.
- Wow. This is where you work?

587
00:41:20,099 --> 00:41:24,186
- Not too shabby.
- Comfortable. - I brought an application.

588
00:41:24,186 --> 00:41:27,525
- Do you still want to open up an account with me?
- Yeah.

589
00:41:27,525 --> 00:41:31,069
- Okay. Do you have your deposit?
- I'll go get it.

590
00:41:31,069 --> 00:41:33,740
Okay. Great.

591
00:41:41,789 --> 00:41:42,781
[Preston Screaming]

592
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:51,301
- Whoa!
- That's amazing!

593
00:41:51,301 --> 00:41:53,302
Sorry, just printed it.

594
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:57,141
Two hundred dollars. Looks like
you fell into some money, huh?

595
00:41:57,141 --> 00:42:00,895
- I make a living.
- Yeah, well, I guess Mr Macintosh...

596
00:42:00,895 --> 00:42:02,896
He knows a good man
when he sees one.

597
00:42:02,896 --> 00:42:06,065
- Will he be opening up an account with us?
- Uh, maybe.

598
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:08,736
Yeah? Great. You know, I'd love
to meet him. How's tonight?

599
00:42:08,736 --> 00:42:11,657
- Uh, tonight. What's tonight?
- Tonight's Wednesday.

600
00:42:11,657 --> 00:42:14,910
Wednesday.

601
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:17,413
Wednesday.
I'm sorry, he's busy.

602
00:42:17,413 --> 00:42:21,333
- Too bad.
- Uh, but I'm not.

603
00:42:21,333 --> 00:42:23,837
Oh, I handle
all his financial affairs.

604
00:42:23,837 --> 00:42:26,256
- You do?
- Not all of them,

605
00:42:26,256 --> 00:42:30,426
but I can tell you a lot about him,
sort of like a pre-meeting.

606
00:42:30,426 --> 00:42:33,681
- And he wouldn't mind?
- Hasn't complained yet.

607
00:42:33,681 --> 00:42:36,933
Okay. I'll come by
around 8:00.

608
00:42:36,933 --> 00:42:39,604
Okay. Wait, I could
send a car for you.

609
00:42:39,604 --> 00:42:43,774
Okay. Cool.
It's a date then. Bye-bye.

610
00:42:43,774 --> 00:42:44,651
A date?

611
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:47,946
A date?

612
00:42:49,739 --> 00:42:52,283
I've never been on a date.

613
00:42:52,283 --> 00:42:55,287
You know what they call me
downtown? The Babe-Meister.

614
00:42:55,287 --> 00:42:57,415
Think about it.

615
00:42:57,415 --> 00:43:01,920
Okay, I'm gonna tell you about
the real deal on dating, which I know.

616
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,257
First of all, women love a great body.
They love... Look at this bod.

617
00:43:05,257 --> 00:43:08,009
- Whoa. See?
- Yeah, yeah.

618
00:43:08,009 --> 00:43:11,931
Of course, you've got a bod now that's
of a Greek god. Really. Think about it.

619
00:43:11,931 --> 00:43:14,433
Women like you to have a good bod because
they want to feel they're protected.

620
00:43:14,433 --> 00:43:16,935
You might have to fight some guy,
you know? But not with those arms.

621
00:43:16,935 --> 00:43:20,606
You don't want to hit a guy with those arms
'cause those pythons would take a guy's head off.

622
00:43:20,606 --> 00:43:23,151
Seriously. You're buff, but we're
gonna get you chiseled.

623
00:43:23,151 --> 00:43:26,947
Okay? Oh, wait.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

624
00:43:26,947 --> 00:43:28,949
I'm having a vision
here of a date.

625
00:43:28,949 --> 00:43:31,534
- The perfect date for you guys.
- Uh, Steak Heaven!

626
00:43:31,534 --> 00:43:36,040
Ho, ho! My little friend, you really
have the hots for this one, huh?

627
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,043
You know, if you really
want to go upscale,

628
00:43:38,043 --> 00:43:41,462
that all-you-can-eat salad bar...
women love that.

629
00:43:41,462 --> 00:43:45,634
And take some with you. You know,
line your pockets with plastic bags.

630
00:43:45,634 --> 00:43:50,013
Put the food in there. 'Cause
it doesn't say "All you can eat here."

631
00:43:50,013 --> 00:43:52,307
Does it say "here" on the sign?
I don't think so.

632
00:43:52,307 --> 00:43:55,644
So you take something back for later.
A little snackaroo.

633
00:43:55,644 --> 00:43:59,732
Oh, women love that. You get home
and you got a pocketful of hot wings.

634
00:43:59,732 --> 00:44:02,528
There's nothing more
that impresses a woman.

635
00:44:02,528 --> 00:44:04,737
Get yourself some flowers.
Get yourself a great body,

636
00:44:04,737 --> 00:44:06,741
some nice hair,
some good clothes, a car,

637
00:44:06,741 --> 00:44:08,743
and learn to say words
like "noncommittal."

638
00:44:08,743 --> 00:44:11,663
You are a date
and a half, pal.

639
00:44:11,663 --> 00:44:16,210
"There he is
Some Tiny Tim"

640
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:19,796
"There he is
Six foot and risin'"

641
00:44:19,796 --> 00:44:23,592
"Ooh, there he is
He's a knockout machine"

642
00:44:23,592 --> 00:44:25,595
- "He's number one He's double cool"
- Yeah!

643
00:44:25,595 --> 00:44:27,931
"He's the naked truth
in magazines"

644
00:44:27,931 --> 00:44:32,058
- "I believe in him"
- "Wonderman"

645
00:44:32,058 --> 00:44:35,438
- "He is a Mr Wonderman"
- "Wonderman"

646
00:44:35,438 --> 00:44:37,565
"He is a Mr Wonderman"

647
00:44:37,565 --> 00:44:40,403
"Ah, yes"

648
00:44:40,403 --> 00:44:44,950
- "Wonderman"
- Ew.

649
00:44:46,951 --> 00:44:51,790
- "Wonderman"
- One more! Yes, yes, yes!

650
00:44:53,124 --> 00:44:53,906
Ah!

651
00:45:01,551 --> 00:45:03,677
[Preston]
Hey, I'm gonna get you!

652
00:45:03,677 --> 00:45:07,057
[Henry] You are little sushi man.
Sushi man down. Big boy throw.

653
00:45:07,057 --> 00:45:10,059
Then they chase around. Come around
other way, fall down. Splat.

654
00:45:10,059 --> 00:45:15,231
- [Preston Screaming]
- " Here comes the wonderman He'd like to say bye-bye"

655
00:45:18,528 --> 00:45:21,406
- Why are you dressed like a game show host?
- I'm going out tonight.

656
00:45:21,406 --> 00:45:23,576
Just a minute, young man.
You're still grounded.

657
00:45:23,576 --> 00:45:27,245
- But it's for Mr Macintosh.
- I don't care.

658
00:45:27,245 --> 00:45:29,581
Macintosh may have a pile of
money, but he doesn't decide...

659
00:45:29,581 --> 00:45:31,624
when my son
is or isn't grounded.

660
00:45:31,624 --> 00:45:34,421
- But it's for my job.
- Your job is to be grounded.

661
00:45:34,421 --> 00:45:39,591
- [Both] Grounded.
- So much for Plan 442.

662
00:45:41,553 --> 00:45:44,599
What do you know
about Plan 442?

663
00:45:44,599 --> 00:45:48,685
Well, it's the investment plan you've
been working on, your "prespectus."

664
00:45:48,685 --> 00:45:52,939
Prospectus. What are you doing
going through my work?

665
00:45:52,939 --> 00:45:56,402
Well, I didn't want to say it,
but I told Mr Macintosh...

666
00:45:56,402 --> 00:46:00,198
about your Plan 442, and he was
very, very interested.

667
00:46:00,198 --> 00:46:04,662
Yep, I promised him I'd bring a copy
of it tonight and show it to him.

668
00:46:04,662 --> 00:46:08,291
But I didn't want to tell you just
in case you got your hopes all up and...

669
00:46:08,291 --> 00:46:10,417
No, no, no, no, no,
of course not.

670
00:46:10,417 --> 00:46:12,505
Let me get you a fresh copy
of the "prespectus."

671
00:46:12,505 --> 00:46:14,796
- I'll get a copy of it, sweetheart.
- Prospectus.

672
00:46:14,796 --> 00:46:16,632
Yeah.

673
00:46:18,093 --> 00:46:20,637
- Here. You're welcome.
- Oh, thank you.

674
00:46:22,389 --> 00:46:24,516
Hurry up. Go. Go!
You want the car keys?

675
00:46:24,516 --> 00:46:27,270
Nah, that's okay, Dad.

676
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:29,565
I don't drive yet.

677
00:46:29,565 --> 00:46:31,857
- [Dad] You want me to drive you?
- [Preston] No, it's okay.

678
00:46:31,857 --> 00:46:34,193
You know, I still haven't met Macintosh.
Maybe I should go over and...

679
00:46:34,193 --> 00:46:37,072
- No! You'll ruin everything.
- Why not?

680
00:46:37,072 --> 00:46:39,823
He has a date tonight
and he's very nervous about it.

681
00:46:39,823 --> 00:46:43,453
- I guess I can see him first thing in the morning.
- Oh, I don't know, Dad.

682
00:46:43,453 --> 00:46:47,666
I mean, he might be up
pretty late with this woman.

683
00:46:47,666 --> 00:46:51,922
[Chuckles]
Lucky dog.

684
00:46:56,426 --> 00:46:58,387
Later, toads.

685
00:47:04,227 --> 00:47:06,396
- [Groaning]
- Thank you. That's enough.

686
00:47:06,396 --> 00:47:08,773
- Oh!
- Sorry.

687
00:47:10,566 --> 00:47:14,029
I can't believe Mr Macintosh went
to all this trouble.

688
00:47:14,029 --> 00:47:18,827
- This place is great.
- Mr Macintosh has been eating here for years.

689
00:47:18,827 --> 00:47:20,452
Oh, yeah? I thought
he just moved here.

690
00:47:20,452 --> 00:47:23,539
There was a Tangerino
where I used to live.

691
00:47:23,539 --> 00:47:24,322
Oh.

692
00:47:25,667 --> 00:47:27,794
[Gargling]

693
00:47:27,794 --> 00:47:32,298
Compliments of the chef
for Mr Waters...

694
00:47:32,298 --> 00:47:34,384
and his lovely guest.

695
00:47:34,384 --> 00:47:38,973
Th-They look
like lobsters,

696
00:47:38,973 --> 00:47:40,475
only weenie.

697
00:47:43,143 --> 00:47:43,927
Oh.

698
00:47:46,524 --> 00:47:49,526
Mr Macintosh wanted you
to have this too.

699
00:47:49,526 --> 00:47:51,612
Oh, thanks.

700
00:47:53,071 --> 00:47:54,072
Oh, wow.

701
00:47:56,324 --> 00:47:59,619
This is beautiful. Oh.

702
00:47:59,619 --> 00:48:02,917
But I can't
accept this from you.

703
00:48:02,917 --> 00:48:05,795
But it's from Mr Macintosh.

704
00:48:05,795 --> 00:48:09,257
- Why?
- Just a little business gift.

705
00:48:09,257 --> 00:48:12,175
I mean, it's deductible,
isn't it?

706
00:48:12,175 --> 00:48:16,682
I'm not really sure,
but it's way too expensive.

707
00:48:16,682 --> 00:48:19,602
Mr Macintosh has
a million dollars.

708
00:48:19,602 --> 00:48:23,313
A million dollars doesn't buy
all that much these days.

709
00:48:23,313 --> 00:48:25,566
Do you think he should have
asked for more?

710
00:48:25,566 --> 00:48:29,445
What exactly
does he do anyway?

711
00:48:29,445 --> 00:48:32,155
Oh, a little of this,
a little of that.

712
00:48:32,155 --> 00:48:35,034
- You know.
- No, I'm afraid I don't.

713
00:48:35,034 --> 00:48:38,454
- Oh, well...
- Is he an entrepreneur?

714
00:48:38,454 --> 00:48:42,793
No, he's American.
Very secretive.

715
00:48:42,793 --> 00:48:44,962
He has some questions
for you too.

716
00:48:44,962 --> 00:48:48,132
Okay.
Shoot.

717
00:48:48,132 --> 00:48:51,553
- "Are you married?"
- No.

718
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:55,390
"What's the shortest guy
you ever dated?"

719
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:58,644
Mmm. I'm not really sure.

720
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:00,812
- "The youngest?"
- You know,

721
00:49:00,812 --> 00:49:03,858
these are pretty
personal questions.

722
00:49:03,858 --> 00:49:06,360
Well, Mr Macintosh
is very interested in you.

723
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:10,864
- He is?
- He's, uh, never met anybody like you before.

724
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:14,243
He's never met me before,
period.

725
00:49:14,243 --> 00:49:18,791
Technically no, but he's been thinking
a lot about you lately.

726
00:49:18,791 --> 00:49:19,886
- He has?
- Yep. Whoa!

727
00:49:24,797 --> 00:49:27,591
Preston!
Are you okay?

728
00:49:27,591 --> 00:49:31,763
- [Screaming]
- [Gasps]

729
00:49:31,763 --> 00:49:33,849
Do you like hamburgers?

730
00:49:33,849 --> 00:49:36,684
I love hamburgers.

731
00:49:38,602 --> 00:49:41,607
Never saw this kid
before in my life.

732
00:49:41,607 --> 00:49:44,694
This is a waste of time.
Come on.

733
00:49:44,694 --> 00:49:47,280
What's so special
about this place?

734
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:51,285
- You'll see.
- Mmm, come on. Tell me.

735
00:49:51,285 --> 00:49:53,787
- Okay.
- You gonna tell me?

736
00:49:53,787 --> 00:49:56,457
- Come with me.
- All right.

737
00:50:00,586 --> 00:50:02,465
- Where are you taking me?
- You'll see.

738
00:50:02,465 --> 00:50:04,799
- See what?
- Okay, get in the middle.

739
00:50:04,799 --> 00:50:10,680
- Okay, ready? Five, four, three,
- Here?

740
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:13,685
Two, one.

741
00:50:13,685 --> 00:50:16,520
[Shay Laughing]
Holy smokes!

742
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:19,315
Okay! Okay, now,
come here, Shay!

743
00:50:19,315 --> 00:50:21,317
- Okay, okay, now!
- Preston, I don't believe this!

744
00:50:21,317 --> 00:50:24,153
Okay, now,
let's run around!

745
00:50:24,153 --> 00:50:27,951
- Don't get wet!
- Get us out!

746
00:50:27,951 --> 00:50:30,161
Run!
[Screams]

747
00:50:30,161 --> 00:50:32,914
- Okay, okay, okay!
- Watch out!

748
00:50:32,914 --> 00:50:35,417
- No, we're gonna get soaked!
- No, no, no. Now come...

749
00:50:35,417 --> 00:50:38,003
Come around here!
Come around here! Come on!

750
00:50:43,425 --> 00:50:46,512
- Okay, hold onto me.
- [Screaming] Hey, where are you?

751
00:50:46,512 --> 00:50:50,016
[Screaming]
Yeah! Yes!

752
00:50:52,353 --> 00:50:55,439
- Whoo, yeah!
- Preston!

753
00:51:17,628 --> 00:51:21,381
[Clapping, Cheering]

754
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:24,177
This is a great idea, Biderman.
Where's all the kids, huh?

755
00:51:24,177 --> 00:51:26,305
Carl, it's late at night.

756
00:51:26,305 --> 00:51:28,808
All the little boys and girls
are tucked in bed. What do you expect?

757
00:51:28,808 --> 00:51:33,146
What I expect is when I give someone a
million dollars, and I come back a day later,

758
00:51:33,146 --> 00:51:35,148
I find the million dollars.
That's what I expect.

759
00:51:35,148 --> 00:51:38,151
- Carl, I'm not a magician.
- You can make it disappear,

760
00:51:38,151 --> 00:51:40,153
- you just can't get it back, right?
- I'm telling you...

761
00:51:40,153 --> 00:51:42,614
If y'all want a kid so bad,
there go one over there.

762
00:51:42,614 --> 00:51:45,660
[Biderman]
That's the little boy from the bank!

763
00:51:48,288 --> 00:51:49,330
Shh.

764
00:51:51,458 --> 00:51:52,502
Shh.

765
00:51:55,672 --> 00:51:57,967
- [Preston Screams]
- Go get him!

766
00:51:57,967 --> 00:52:00,801
- Oh, I'll race ya to the limo! I'll race ya to the limo!
- What? Okay, I'll race ya!

767
00:52:00,801 --> 00:52:02,052
[Shouting]

768
00:52:04,805 --> 00:52:06,892
[Screaming]

769
00:52:06,892 --> 00:52:09,645
- I got the door for ya!
- Open the door. It's freezing!

770
00:52:09,645 --> 00:52:12,648
Go, Henry!
Go, Henry, go!

771
00:52:12,648 --> 00:52:16,735
- [Henry] Here we go!
- [Groaning]

772
00:52:16,735 --> 00:52:21,116
He got away again! I don't
believe this! He got away again!

773
00:52:22,449 --> 00:52:25,120
[Screaming]

774
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:28,289
[Shay]
This was the most fun.

775
00:52:28,289 --> 00:52:32,835
- I haven't done anything like this since I was a little kid.
- Me neither.

776
00:52:32,835 --> 00:52:35,173
Thank you so much.

777
00:52:35,173 --> 00:52:37,509
When can I see you again?

778
00:52:37,509 --> 00:52:43,347
Well, I really have to spend
some time with my job right now.

779
00:52:44,809 --> 00:52:48,021
Well, uh,
I'm having a party.

780
00:52:48,021 --> 00:52:50,020
On Friday.

781
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:52,023
Can you come?

782
00:52:52,023 --> 00:52:54,193
It's for Mr Macintosh.

783
00:52:54,193 --> 00:52:58,198
Um, it could be
for your business, sort of.

784
00:52:58,198 --> 00:53:00,782
Mr Macintosh will
really be there?

785
00:53:00,782 --> 00:53:04,289
Uh-huh.
It's his birthday.

786
00:53:04,289 --> 00:53:06,958
Okay.
Well, great.

787
00:53:06,958 --> 00:53:08,959
It's a date then.

788
00:53:08,959 --> 00:53:11,211
Oh, I'm getting out
up here.

789
00:53:15,550 --> 00:53:18,136
It was really fun.

790
00:53:18,136 --> 00:53:20,388
And, uh,

791
00:53:20,388 --> 00:53:24,684
- I had such a good time.
- Me too.

792
00:53:24,684 --> 00:53:28,814
- Good night, Preston.
- Good night, Shay.

793
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:34,655
- See you later.
- Bye-bye.

794
00:53:37,282 --> 00:53:40,285
- Good night, ma'am. Bye now. It's been a pleasure.
- Thank you.

795
00:53:58,055 --> 00:54:00,182
[Henry]
So you're having a party Friday?

796
00:54:00,182 --> 00:54:02,476
[Preston] Oh, yeah,
it's Mr Macintosh's birthday.

797
00:54:02,476 --> 00:54:04,811
Oh, I thought you said
it was your birthday Friday.

798
00:54:04,811 --> 00:54:07,648
Well, we're gonna have
a joint party for the both of us.

799
00:54:07,648 --> 00:54:11,153
Oh. Well, it's a good thing it worked out
your birthdays are around the same time.

800
00:54:11,153 --> 00:54:15,574
Hey, you wanna move that horse? Come
on. What is this, Bonanza? Let's go!

801
00:54:17,284 --> 00:54:19,663
Well, here we are.
Home at last.

802
00:54:19,663 --> 00:54:21,997
- Thanks, Henry.
- My pleasure.

803
00:54:21,997 --> 00:54:24,000
Hey! Preston Waters!

804
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,336
- Good night.
- You know what you got, pal?

805
00:54:26,336 --> 00:54:29,672
- What?
- S-T-Y-L-E.

806
00:54:29,672 --> 00:54:33,177
- Style. Good night, Henry.
- Style. Good night.

807
00:54:34,803 --> 00:54:37,473
Take it easy, man.
Good night.

808
00:54:40,351 --> 00:54:45,690
Macintosh and I are having
the biggest birthday party ever.

809
00:55:04,419 --> 00:55:07,964
- Honey, where's Preston?
- He's working for Macintosh.

810
00:55:07,964 --> 00:55:11,635
Oh. Where's
Damien and Ralph?

811
00:55:11,635 --> 00:55:13,971
They're working
for Macintosh too.

812
00:55:13,971 --> 00:55:14,753
Oh.

813
00:55:21,771 --> 00:55:24,816
- Have you met Macintosh?
- No, I thought you met him.

814
00:55:24,816 --> 00:55:28,279
- No, I haven't met him.
- Well, I haven't met him either.

[Machine Humming]

816
00:55:33,492 --> 00:55:39,165
Keep 'em comin'. Mr Macintosh wants me
to get plenty of practise.

817
00:55:41,459 --> 00:55:44,546
[Screams]
Watch where you're hittin' those!

818
00:55:44,546 --> 00:55:47,090
Quit messin' around.
Macintosh is watching.

819
00:55:47,090 --> 00:55:49,426
Where? We've still
never seen him.

820
00:55:49,426 --> 00:55:53,598
Just get back to work.
He's watching.

821
00:55:53,598 --> 00:55:56,142
- " [Loud Rock]
- [Man]... coming out of the garage.

[Henry]
Hey, Preston!

826
00:56:06,444 --> 00:56:08,447
Your party planner's
here again.

827
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:11,199
[Woman]
Piston! Piston! Piston!

828
00:56:11,199 --> 00:56:13,286
Turn off this contraption.
I have wonderful news.

829
00:56:13,286 --> 00:56:17,581
Mr Macintosh's birthday is going
to be the event of the century.

830
00:56:17,581 --> 00:56:19,709
We gonna make
the front page from coast to coast.

831
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:21,962
Oh, we are so lucky,
lucky, lucky!

832
00:56:21,962 --> 00:56:24,466
Now what kind of food
does Mr Macintosh like?

833
00:56:24,466 --> 00:56:26,467
- I don't know.
- And who are his friends?

834
00:56:26,467 --> 00:56:31,557
- Do you have a guest list?
- Uh, I don't think so.

835
00:56:31,557 --> 00:56:33,891
You know, dewdrop, I think
I should meet him because...

836
00:56:33,891 --> 00:56:35,893
I'm gonna need
a little cash deposit.

837
00:56:35,893 --> 00:56:39,606
Oh. Uh, here.
Let me get you some cash.

838
00:56:39,606 --> 00:56:41,734
Ooh, yes, you do
have money, don't you?

839
00:56:41,734 --> 00:56:44,988
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Careful walking around with this much money, darling.

840
00:56:44,988 --> 00:56:46,989
Somebody could just
rip you right off.

841
00:56:46,989 --> 00:56:49,951
Now, this first $10,000
is going to be the deposit.

842
00:56:49,951 --> 00:56:52,329
Now, of course, I'll get
the balance at the party,

843
00:56:52,329 --> 00:56:56,208
and Mr Macintosh
is good for it?

844
00:56:56,208 --> 00:56:59,296
I am just so looking forward
to meeting him.

845
00:56:59,296 --> 00:57:02,340
- Who isn't?
- Waiters, security,

846
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:04,635
- guest list, paparazzi...
- Oh, and Yvonne?

847
00:57:04,635 --> 00:57:08,471
- Yes?
- Remember, it's Preston.

848
00:57:08,471 --> 00:57:10,307
Whatever!

849
00:57:12,934 --> 00:57:14,895
Hey, uh, hey, Henry.

850
00:57:14,895 --> 00:57:20,694
[Grunting, Laughing] It's attack
of the 50-foot chauffeur from hell!

851
00:57:20,694 --> 00:57:24,364
I was just wondering if you
wanted to play some video games.

852
00:57:24,364 --> 00:57:26,366
Oh, man, I wish you'd
have said something.

853
00:57:26,366 --> 00:57:28,910
I can't. I promised some friends
I was gonna meet 'em in a while.

854
00:57:28,910 --> 00:57:31,581
Oh, okay.
No problem.

855
00:57:31,581 --> 00:57:33,998
I'll tell you what. I'll drop you over
at one of your friend's place...

856
00:57:33,998 --> 00:57:36,169
on the way over, and you
can have some fun there.

857
00:57:36,169 --> 00:57:40,213
Nah. Maybe I'll go to the park.

858
00:57:40,213 --> 00:57:42,426
All right. It's up to you.
Hey, Preston,

859
00:57:42,426 --> 00:57:45,846
- is my tie straight?
- Well, it looks perfect.

860
00:57:45,846 --> 00:57:48,682
All right.
Later.

861
00:58:18,339 --> 00:58:22,887
- Over here.
- Over here!

862
00:58:41,072 --> 00:58:44,410
There it is.
That's the park up ahead.

863
00:58:44,410 --> 00:58:47,998
Where did all these kids
come from?

864
00:58:47,998 --> 00:58:50,208
Keep driving and maybe
someday I'll tell you.

865
00:58:50,208 --> 00:58:54,838
- How could you hit a kid?
- I didn't hit a kid. I ran over his bicycle.

866
00:58:54,838 --> 00:58:57,548
I had a dog once
that got hit by a train.

867
00:58:57,548 --> 00:59:01,052
- Thanks for sharing, Juice.
- Old King Cole we called him.

868
00:59:01,052 --> 00:59:03,724
- He was a merry old soul.
- It's him.

869
00:59:03,724 --> 00:59:06,476
- Boy with the backpack.
- Go! Go! Go!

870
00:59:06,476 --> 00:59:09,270
- The sign says "No Cars Allowed"!
- Just drive!

871
00:59:09,270 --> 00:59:10,271
Quigley!

00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:16,194

- Just drive!

- Carl, this isn't a good idea.
- Shut up! Whoa!

Let go, man.
What's goin' on?

875
00:59:24,203 --> 00:59:26,791
- Oooh!
- Oooh!

00:59:26,791 --> 00:59:29,709
- I'm gonna get him.
- We're gonna tear him up!

877
00:59:29,709 --> 00:59:33,672
- Reach over there and get him!
- Your butt is mine, kid!

878
00:59:33,672 --> 00:59:35,633
I've been wantin'
this little punk.

00:59:35,633 --> 00:59:38,844
I own you!
I own you, kid!

Come here!
He's got my money!

881
00:59:43,892 --> 00:59:44,642
Aaaah!

882
00:59:49,315 --> 00:59:51,441
- Follow him on foot! Go!
- Follow him on foot?

883
00:59:51,441 --> 00:59:54,404
- Do I look like a bloodhound, a professional tracker?
- Juicy, listen.

884
00:59:54,404 --> 00:59:57,365
If we don't get that kid,
nobody gets paid.

- Not a problem.

Here, kiddie, kiddie!

888
01:00:08,377 --> 01:00:12,130
Oh, there you go. Come here, boy.
I'm gonna get you now.

889
01:00:12,130 --> 01:00:15,511
I've been lookin' for you!

890
01:00:16,886 --> 01:00:19,806
Huh? Oh, no.

891
01:00:21,934 --> 01:00:24,770
There he goes.
Yes. Come here, boy!

892
01:00:24,770 --> 01:00:27,649
I'm gonna get you now!
Aaaah!

893
01:00:30,567 --> 01:00:36,157
Don't believe this! Kill that kid when I
find him. I'm not gettin' paid for this.

894
01:00:36,157 --> 01:00:39,369
- Where are we going now? My hands are over my eyes.
- Shut up!

895
01:00:43,374 --> 01:00:47,128
- Get out...
- [Screaming]

- Okay, there he is!
- Come here! Come here!

900
01:00:59,057 --> 01:01:01,643
- Juice! Run after him.
- You must be crazy. You run after him.

901
01:01:01,643 --> 01:01:05,856
- Just ran through this whole entire park.
- Fine, get in the car.

902
01:01:05,856 --> 01:01:09,193
- [Coughing]
- Don't blow chunks in my car. I just had it detailed.

903
01:01:09,193 --> 01:01:12,572
- I'm cool!
- Are you sure? Are you sure?

904

- I'm not gonna mess up your priceless detail.
- Come on.

- Let's go!
- After him!

01:01:29,423 --> 01:01:31,884
- Hey, dude!
- [Juice] Move outta the way.

01:01:31,884 --> 01:01:32,637
Sorry!

910
01:01:41,479 --> 01:01:46,192
- Get 'im!
- Your butt is mine!

911
01:01:49,947 --> 01:01:51,864
I want this kid...
What are you doing?

912
01:01:51,864 --> 01:01:55,286
- Yeah!
- No! Carl, watch out!

913
01:01:55,286 --> 01:01:57,913
[Juice]
Oh, no!

914
01:01:57,913 --> 01:01:59,216
Whoa!

- Aah! No!
- Oh, man!

916
01:02:08,926 --> 01:02:09,968
Yes!

917
01:02:12,053 --> 01:02:15,100
Now that's a display
of fine driving right there.

918
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:19,854
You know, Carl, it might be easier
just to steal another million dollars.

919
01:02:28,156 --> 01:02:31,992
Hello, Mr Jackson.

920
01:02:31,992 --> 01:02:36,665
Well, well, well, if it isn't the world's
youngest personal injury attorney.

921
01:02:36,665 --> 01:02:39,669
You know, you're in a lot
of trouble today, little man.

922
01:02:39,669 --> 01:02:42,255
Yeah, 'cause today
I have been drinking vodka.

923
01:02:42,255 --> 01:02:44,589
- Take a hike, butt-brain.
- What?

924
01:02:44,589 --> 01:02:48,845
- Take a...
- Never mind, never mind. Never mind, never mind!

925
01:02:48,845 --> 01:02:51,722
[Chattering]

926
01:02:51,722 --> 01:02:54,935
[Yvonne] Antoine, get that truck thing
off the stage. Thank you!

01:02:57,103 --> 01:03:00,482
Get those golden gloves off!
Thank you!

928
01:03:02,693 --> 01:03:05,780
Love, love, love, love!
What do you think?

929
01:03:05,780 --> 01:03:09,032
Ta-da! Is this
to die, or what?

930
01:03:09,032 --> 01:03:12,119
Uh, yeah, sure,
it's, uh, to die.

931
01:03:12,119 --> 01:03:14,956
I can't wait to show it
to Mr Macintosh.

932
01:03:14,956 --> 01:03:17,250
Come on, honey, let's see
what they did with that...

933
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:21,338
"Is it to die for or what?"
[Laughing]

934
01:03:21,338 --> 01:03:25,426
Where did you find her?
Oh, man.

935
01:03:25,426 --> 01:03:29,056
- What does this cost?
- I don't know.

936
01:03:29,056 --> 01:03:34,059
- What do you think it should cost?
- Lots, lots.

937
01:03:34,059 --> 01:03:36,645
Kid, why don't you just tell me what
I need to know. I'm a good guy.

938
01:03:36,645 --> 01:03:39,192
Okay, how good are you
going to be to me?

939
01:03:39,192 --> 01:03:41,777
In round numbers.

940
01:03:41,777 --> 01:03:44,989
I don't think you get
the picture, sonny.

941
01:03:47,866 --> 01:03:51,038
- Maybe you need a better view.
- [Screaming]

942

[Screaming] Preston Waters,
1508 Oak Street, Hillsdale, Indiana!

943
01:03:54,334 --> 01:03:57,877
- Thank you.
- [Crying]

944
01:03:57,877 --> 01:03:59,924
- You all right?
- Aaah! Aaah!

945
01:03:59,924 --> 01:04:03,468
- Is something wrong?
- No, not at all.

946
01:04:03,468 --> 01:04:07,723
- Is Mr Macintosh around?
- Uh, no.

947
01:04:07,723 --> 01:04:09,808
- But he will be here tonight?
- Yeah.

948
01:04:09,808 --> 01:04:11,851
- In person?
- In person.

949
01:04:11,851 --> 01:04:15,189
- Okay. I'll see you tonight?
- Okay.

950
01:04:15,189 --> 01:04:18,777
Okay. You're looking good.
Bye.

951
01:04:18,777 --> 01:04:22,572
- I'll be calling.
- What a babe.

952
01:04:22,572 --> 01:04:24,574
Baby brother
comes into his own.

953
01:04:24,574 --> 01:04:26,659
For a little weasel, he sure knows
how to get a girlfriend.

954
01:04:26,659 --> 01:04:29,205
- Too bad he picked a fortune hunter.
- Little love pilot...

955
01:04:29,205 --> 01:04:31,748
shot down in flames
by a gold digger.

956
01:04:31,748 --> 01:04:33,834
By a what?

957
01:04:33,834 --> 01:04:37,254
Gold digger, someone
who is only after money. I know women,

958
01:04:37,254 --> 01:04:39,882
and that one is after
Macintosh's cold, hard cash.

959
01:04:39,882 --> 01:04:44,680
For your information,
me and Shay already went on a date...

960
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:47,933
and she had one
fantastic time, boys.

961
01:04:47,933 --> 01:04:51,352
Oh, yes, every second
she was getting closer...

962
01:04:51,352 --> 01:04:53,773
- and closer to Mr Macintosh.
- [Laughing]

963
01:04:53,773 --> 01:04:57,611
- Shut up!
- Just answer me this.

964
01:04:57,611 --> 01:05:00,906
Did she ever, ever just once,
come by without saying,

965
01:05:00,906 --> 01:05:04,159
"Meanwhile, I wonder if
I could see Mr Macintosh?"

966
01:05:04,159 --> 01:05:07,121
She's a gold digger, man.
She just wants Macintosh's money.

967
01:05:07,121 --> 01:05:09,623
- Yeah! Ow!
- Don't rub it. Be a man.

968
01:05:09,623 --> 01:05:12,251
- Don't rub it.
- I'll rub it if I want to.

969
01:05:12,251 --> 01:05:17,049
- She wants a guy with money, not some little kid with an empty piggy bank.
- Yeah.

970
01:05:36,530 --> 01:05:41,491
"Well, I'll wait by the windows
I'll wait by the door"

971
01:05:41,491 --> 01:05:43,742
"To make sure
you don't come home"

972
01:05:43,742 --> 01:05:48,582
- You ever known any gold diggers?
- Man, have I.

973
01:05:48,582 --> 01:05:50,877
I hate 'em.
They're the worst.

974
01:05:50,877 --> 01:05:56,175
Anybody who is your friend because you
have money is not your friend at all.

975
01:05:56,175 --> 01:05:58,469
You know what
they say about gold?

976
01:05:58,469 --> 01:06:01,430
"He who has the gold
makes the rules"?

977
01:06:01,430 --> 01:06:05,058
No, no, no.
"A fool and his gold are soon parted."

978
01:06:05,058 --> 01:06:06,979
What does that mean?

979
01:06:06,979 --> 01:06:10,315
"A fool and his gold are soon parted."
Those old sayings, man,

980
01:06:10,315 --> 01:06:13,068
I don't get 'em. I don't even
know really what that means.

981
01:06:13,068 --> 01:06:17,113
You ever heard:
"More than one way to skin a cat"?

982
01:06:17,113 --> 01:06:19,573
Who skins cats?
Why would you skin a cat?

983
01:06:19,573 --> 01:06:23,288
And there is not more than one way
to skin a cat. There is only one way.

984
01:06:23,288 --> 01:06:25,372
You grab the cat,
you rip the skin off the cat.

985
01:06:25,372 --> 01:06:28,126
What is the number two way?
You put a hose up the cat's butt?

986
01:06:28,126 --> 01:06:30,170
He gets so bloated
that he skins himself?

987
01:06:30,170 --> 01:06:34,716
Does he have a piece
of Velcro under his butt? No.

988
01:06:34,716 --> 01:06:38,095
"Kill two birds with one stone."
You heard that one?

989
01:06:38,095 --> 01:06:40,764
You know anyone who has even
killed one bird with one stone?

990
01:06:40,764 --> 01:06:42,976
Kids try it all the time.
You can't hit a bird with a stone.

991
01:06:42,976 --> 01:06:45,812
Unless you got a huge stone
and they're tiny baby birds.

992
01:06:45,812 --> 01:06:49,692
Then... [lmitating Crash]
Beep, beep! Dead.

993
01:06:49,692 --> 01:06:52,985
[Sighing]
"A fool and his gold are soon parted."

994
01:06:52,985 --> 01:06:56,491
I guess it means
that if you're a fool,

995
01:06:56,491 --> 01:06:58,660
your gold or your money
is soon gone.

996
01:06:58,660 --> 01:07:01,371
Once it's gone, it is
outta there. It is history.

997
01:07:01,371 --> 01:07:05,250
It is dust. It is vapour. It is no more.
You are living in Brokesville.

998
01:07:05,250 --> 01:07:09,630
- Unless you have Macintosh's kind of money.
- What if you don't?

999
01:07:09,630 --> 01:07:14,135
I guess then you find out
who your real friends are.

1000
01:07:15,804 --> 01:07:18,306
Man, we look good.

1001
01:07:25,938 --> 01:07:29,486
- Is everybody having a good time?
- [Woman Laughing]

1002
01:07:29,486 --> 01:07:32,280
- Good, you are.
- "Yes, we are, darling." Wow, look at the balloons.

1003
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:36,617
- This is great. Look at the ice sculpture.
- Presents!

1004
01:07:36,617 --> 01:07:40,997
Hey, hey, hey, kid, no touching.
Those are Mr Macintosh's.

1005
01:07:40,997 --> 01:07:45,545
Go find your parents.
Go on, get outta here.

1006
01:07:45,545 --> 01:07:46,295
Go on!

1007
01:07:49,090 --> 01:07:52,259
- I just want to see Mr Macintosh.
- I just want to pig out.

1008
01:07:52,259 --> 01:07:55,180
[Chuckling]
Hey, look at that.

1009
01:07:55,180 --> 01:07:57,225
Excuse me.

1010
01:07:59,142 --> 01:08:03,689
- Sorry!
- Exactly who are you looking for, Preston?

1011
01:08:03,689 --> 01:08:07,444
- Have you seen Shay?
- I haven't seen her, but she'll be around.

1012
01:08:07,444 --> 01:08:09,780
Come on... Oh, man,
look at all this food!

1013
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:12,490
Macintosh doesn't show,
we bring the kid in, agreed?

1014
01:08:12,490 --> 01:08:17,330
If Preston says Macintosh is gonna
be there, Macintosh will be there.

1015
01:08:17,330 --> 01:08:21,375
But you don't make a move, until
I give you the signal, understood?

1016
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:24,503
We got eight men ready to go in
and nail him the second he shows up!

1017
01:08:24,503 --> 01:08:27,465
We close this deal tonight!

1018
01:08:30,677 --> 01:08:34,765
Where's the pizza and the ice cream?
What's going on here?

1019
01:08:34,765 --> 01:08:38,226
This could have been a pizza before
it got run over by a couple of trucks.

1020
01:08:38,226 --> 01:08:42,356
Oh, that looks tasty. Looks like
something you'd find between your toes.

1021
01:08:42,356 --> 01:08:46,820
Ah, ah, ah!
It's sucking the life outta me!

1022
01:08:46,820 --> 01:08:50,699
- Shut up! Everybody's looking.
- So what? Who cares?

1023
01:08:50,699 --> 01:08:54,077
Relax, have a good time. She'll show up.
Oh, there's Shay now. Ha!

1024
01:08:54,077 --> 01:08:57,248
Just kidding. I was kidding ya!
Would you just relax?

1025
01:08:57,248 --> 01:09:02,211
She'll be here. It's not at all
what you thought it'd be like?

1026
01:09:02,211 --> 01:09:07,801
Hate being rich, huh?
Preston? Preston?

1027
01:09:11,471 --> 01:09:13,348
Ice cream, ice cream.

1028
01:09:13,348 --> 01:09:15,602
Yoo-hoo, Preston!

1029
01:09:15,602 --> 01:09:19,688
Now, where is our mystery man? It's time
for Mr Macintosh to make his appearance.

1030
01:09:19,688 --> 01:09:23,068
I like to give my employers
their bills directly.

1031
01:09:23,068 --> 01:09:27,114
That way if they have any questions
or heart attacks or something...

1032
01:09:27,114 --> 01:09:30,575
- I'll give it to him.
- Fine.

1033
01:09:30,575 --> 01:09:33,705
Be quick about it.

1034
01:09:33,705 --> 01:09:36,415
$100,000?

1035
01:09:36,415 --> 01:09:40,878
Sweetheart, I know this seems like a whole
lot of money to normal people like me and you,

1036
01:09:40,878 --> 01:09:43,466
but to a man like Macintosh
this is just pennies.

1037
01:09:43,466 --> 01:09:46,844
- Now, you get up there and get me my money!
- Ow! I'll get your money.

1038
01:09:46,844 --> 01:09:50,013
[Computer Beeping]

1039
01:09:55,227 --> 01:09:56,063
Party: $100,000.

1040
01:09:59,774 --> 01:10:01,653
Not a problem.
You can leave it.

1041
01:10:01,653 --> 01:10:03,779
This is fine.
I'll be right back. Thank you.

1042
01:10:03,779 --> 01:10:07,033
[Computer]
Transaction not possible.

1043
01:10:07,033 --> 01:10:09,284
Insufficient funds.

1044
01:10:09,284 --> 01:10:13,874
Current balance: $332.17.

1045
01:10:13,874 --> 01:10:16,460
- Transaction not possible.
- Three hundred dollars?

1046
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:20,004
- Insufficient funds. Transaction not possible.
- Oh, no!

1047
01:10:20,004 --> 01:10:22,968
- No, please, God.
- Insufficient funds.

1048
01:10:22,968 --> 01:10:26,804
This can't be right.

1049
01:10:26,804 --> 01:10:32,144
One, two, three, four...

1050
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:38,316
[Chattering]

1051
01:10:38,316 --> 01:10:41,777
It's gone.
It's all gone.

1052
01:10:41,777 --> 01:10:44,448
[Knocking]

1053
01:10:44,448 --> 01:10:46,659
Mr Macintosh?
Oh, sorry to bother you.

1054
01:10:46,659 --> 01:10:49,829
It's Fred Waters,
Preston's dad.

1055
01:10:49,829 --> 01:10:52,999
I know you got a bash going on here,
so I'll make it brief.

1056
01:10:52,999 --> 01:10:54,960
But, uh,

1057
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:59,338
I wanted to ask you
a favour.

1058
01:10:59,338 --> 01:11:02,677
You see, today is Preston's
birthday and if you see him,

1059
01:11:02,677 --> 01:11:06,222
if you could send him home
a little early.

1060
01:11:09,141 --> 01:11:12,020
Lately he's been
working so hard.

1061
01:11:12,020 --> 01:11:16,150
All of a sudden money's
become so important to him.

1062
01:11:16,150 --> 01:11:18,194
I guess that's
mostly my fault.

1063
01:11:18,194 --> 01:11:21,196
You don't have kids,
do you, Mr Macintosh?

1064
01:11:21,196 --> 01:11:26,202
I'll tell you, it's very easy
to make mistakes with them.

1065
01:11:26,202 --> 01:11:30,541
I haven't always paid enough
attention to my kids.

1066
01:11:30,541 --> 01:11:34,419
I pushed them
too hard... maybe.

1067
01:11:34,419 --> 01:11:37,131
Especially Preston.

1068
01:11:37,131 --> 01:11:39,550
I guess I expect
more from him.

1069
01:11:39,550 --> 01:11:44,681
He reminds me of myself at that age.
I couldn't wait to grow up.

1070
01:11:44,681 --> 01:11:48,893
I'm afraid he's missing out
on his childhood.

1071
01:11:52,106 --> 01:11:54,023
So am I.

1072
01:11:56,028 --> 01:11:59,864
Well, thanks. I won't take up
any more of your time.

1073
01:11:59,864 --> 01:12:04,745
And we appreciate you
sending Preston home early.

1074
01:12:04,745 --> 01:12:08,457
If... If he wants to come,
that is.

1075
01:12:08,457 --> 01:12:12,253
- [Whispering] I want to come home.
- Thanks.

1076
01:12:12,253 --> 01:12:13,379
Dad. Dad?

1077
01:12:17,634 --> 01:12:18,677
Dad?

1078
01:12:20,261 --> 01:12:22,264
Dad! Dad!

1079
01:12:25,810 --> 01:12:27,686
Dad!

1080
01:12:27,686 --> 01:12:30,064
Dad, wait!

1081
01:12:30,064 --> 01:12:34,193
Daddy! Henry?

1082
01:12:34,193 --> 01:12:37,363
Henry! Wait a minute,
where's Henry?

1083
01:12:37,363 --> 01:12:40,284
Your driver?
He left a little while ago.

1084
01:12:40,284 --> 01:12:43,995
H-He left?
You sure it was Henry?

1085
01:12:43,995 --> 01:12:45,998
Big guy, white limo.

1086
01:12:45,998 --> 01:12:48,960
He's gone.

1087
01:12:50,586 --> 01:12:52,672
Thanks.

1088
01:12:56,594 --> 01:12:59,972
Now I know
who my friends are.

1089
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:07,146
Excuse me. Sorry.

1090
01:13:07,146 --> 01:13:09,691
- [Door Opening]
- [Shay] Preston?

1091
01:13:09,691 --> 01:13:12,195
Mr Macintosh?

1092
01:13:13,987 --> 01:13:17,615
- Mr Macintosh?
- It's just me.

1093
01:13:17,615 --> 01:13:21,119
- Which one of us did you want?
- I was looking for you.

1094
01:13:21,119 --> 01:13:24,999
- Oh, good.
- And Mr Macintosh.

1095
01:13:24,999 --> 01:13:28,837
Look, it's very, very important
that I find Mr Macintosh right now.

1096
01:13:28,837 --> 01:13:33,008
- Do you understand?
- He's nowhere.

1097
01:13:33,008 --> 01:13:36,678
- He's gone. I think you'd better leave too.
- Preston...

1098
01:13:36,678 --> 01:13:40,475
- you could be in danger.
- Just go, okay?

1099
01:13:40,475 --> 01:13:44,313
You got your necklace.
Just take it and leave.

1100
01:13:46,982 --> 01:13:50,068
"Give it back
There's no time to lose"

1101
01:13:50,068 --> 01:13:52,446
"So give it back
Give it back"

1102
01:13:52,446 --> 01:13:55,907
Riggs? Riggs?
Riggs?

1103
01:14:00,163 --> 01:14:02,083
Looks like
no one's home.

1104
01:14:02,083 --> 01:14:04,542
- Shut up, Wienerman.
- Biderman.

1105
01:14:04,542 --> 01:14:06,544
- Where is he?
- I don't know, but he might be down the street...

1106
01:14:06,544 --> 01:14:09,215
at Mr Macintosh's,
that's his boss.

1107
01:14:09,215 --> 01:14:11,925
- Macintosh. Come on!
- [Whimpering]

1108
01:14:11,925 --> 01:14:16,764
You know, I do like
what they have done with this colour.

1109
01:14:18,433 --> 01:14:22,313
There you are, puppy-butt.
Did you get me my money?

1110
01:14:22,313 --> 01:14:25,065
- Uh, Macintosh has disappeared.
- What?

1111
01:14:25,065 --> 01:14:27,943
Now, I am warning you, Tom Thumb,
don't you trifle with me.

1112
01:14:27,943 --> 01:14:30,821
If I don't get paid,
I will sue Mr Macintosh...

1113
01:14:30,821 --> 01:14:33,659
for every dime
he is worth!

1114
01:14:33,659 --> 01:14:36,744
Well, be sure and tell me
when you find him.

1115
01:14:36,744 --> 01:14:40,625
Okay, little Mr Man,
this party is over!

1116
01:14:40,625 --> 01:14:45,002
Quiet! Stop that playing! Stop that
music! Quiet! Attention! Attention!

1117
01:14:45,002 --> 01:14:47,215
Everybody,
this party is over!

1118
01:14:47,215 --> 01:14:50,051
Our host...
can't pay his bills!

1119
01:14:50,051 --> 01:14:53,387
- Mr Macintosh is a fraud!
- [Woman] What?

1120
01:14:53,387 --> 01:14:56,390
[Crowd Murmuring]
Who's that kid?

1121
01:14:56,390 --> 01:15:01,188
She's right.
Hate to tell you this,

1122
01:15:01,188 --> 01:15:04,733
but there's been
a terrible mistake.

1123
01:15:04,733 --> 01:15:06,611
Nobody s-should
have been invited.

1124
01:15:06,611 --> 01:15:09,613
Macintosh is... is gone.

1125
01:15:09,613 --> 01:15:12,617
And he's not coming back.

1126
01:15:12,617 --> 01:15:17,998
So I think you should
all leave too, so go. Go on.

1127
01:15:17,998 --> 01:15:22,379
Close down the bar!
Come on, let's get outta here.

1128
01:15:22,379 --> 01:15:24,380
Come on, Antoine.
Move it!

1129
01:15:24,380 --> 01:15:26,965
Come on, move it!

1130
01:15:36,853 --> 01:15:39,688
Come back with those glasses!
Give me that!

1131
01:15:39,688 --> 01:15:41,733
Oh! Oh! Oh!

1132
01:16:14,060 --> 01:16:16,061
[Knocking]

1133
01:16:16,061 --> 01:16:16,810
Henry?

1134
01:16:19,691 --> 01:16:22,945
Henry!
I knew you'd come back!

1135
01:16:24,822 --> 01:16:26,615
Henry...

1136
01:16:26,615 --> 01:16:29,786
Happy birthday.
I'm here to blow out your candles.

1137
01:16:29,786 --> 01:16:33,831
- Oh! Let me go!
- What's your hurry, kid? Got a big cheque to cash?

1138
01:16:38,252 --> 01:16:41,755
- Let me go!
- I like this pad. What do you think, Juice?

1139
01:16:41,755 --> 01:16:45,260
Oh, yeah, I like the pad.
It looks real nice.

1140
01:16:45,260 --> 01:16:48,805
- Can you handle it? Got the TV, drums.
- Oh, I like this.

1141
01:16:48,805 --> 01:16:50,808
- TV, drums.
- All kinds of toys.

1142
01:16:50,808 --> 01:16:54,270
- He's got a little taste, a little flavour.
- What's this thing here?

1143
01:16:54,270 --> 01:16:57,358
- I don't think I've seen one of those before.
- How do you work this?

1144
01:16:57,358 --> 01:17:00,944
Well, you turn the knob...

1145
01:17:00,944 --> 01:17:05,116
You really shouldn't let him
in such a nice house as this.

1146
01:17:05,116 --> 01:17:07,910
All your stuff
could get broken.

1147
01:17:07,910 --> 01:17:10,163
Kid, where's Macintosh?

1148
01:17:10,163 --> 01:17:13,000
N-Nowhere.

1149
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:16,710
He's nowhere.
I'm going to ask you one more time.

1150
01:17:16,710 --> 01:17:19,423
Where is he?
Huh!

1151
01:17:19,423 --> 01:17:21,758
There is no Macintosh.

1152
01:17:21,758 --> 01:17:25,179
- I made him up. It was me the whole time.
- Don't give me that.

1153
01:17:25,179 --> 01:17:27,681
- Who bought this house?
- I-I did.

1154
01:17:27,681 --> 01:17:30,269
You? You outbid me?

1155
01:17:30,269 --> 01:17:35,400
Wait a minute. You tryin' to tell me
that this little boy here...

1156
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:38,192
outbid you
with your own money?

1157
01:17:38,192 --> 01:17:41,197
Be a fly on the wall,
okay, Juice?

1158
01:17:41,197 --> 01:17:45,284
Listen, kid, you know it's illegal
to take things that don't belong to you.

1159
01:17:45,284 --> 01:17:49,413
I know. I feel awful.
Take me to the police.

1160
01:17:49,413 --> 01:17:54,253
- Carl, don't do it. It's a trick.
- Get outta here.

1161
01:17:54,253 --> 01:17:58,091
Son, I don't want to take you
to the police. Just tell me, okay?

1162
01:17:58,091 --> 01:18:01,094
Where's my money?

1163
01:18:01,094 --> 01:18:04,139
I-I spent it.

1164
01:18:04,139 --> 01:18:09,520
- All of it?
- All of it.

1165
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:12,188
How could you spend...

1166
01:18:12,188 --> 01:18:16,109
a million dollars
in six days?

1167
01:18:16,109 --> 01:18:19,029
You must not have been
shopping lately.

1168
01:18:19,029 --> 01:18:22,325
Carl, Carl,
wait a minute.

1169
01:18:22,325 --> 01:18:25,787
Maybe we're thinking about
this Macintosh thing in the wrong way.

1170
01:18:25,787 --> 01:18:28,999
- What are you talking about?
- You needed a new house, a new identity.

1171
01:18:28,999 --> 01:18:31,418
This kid,
he's done it for you.

1172
01:18:31,418 --> 01:18:34,504
I mean, Macintosh
could run for mayor here.

1173
01:18:34,504 --> 01:18:37,841
Yeah, I kind of like the idea of that...
Mayor Quigley.

1174
01:18:37,841 --> 01:18:42,763
No, no, Mayor Macintosh.
I like it.

1175
01:18:42,763 --> 01:18:46,475
Look, there's only one problem
with that. The... Aaah!

- Come back here!

- Wait for me! I'm coming!
- He's upstairs, man!

1178

Break it down!

1179
01:18:56,654 --> 01:18:59,116
There he is!

1180
01:19:01,952 --> 01:19:04,120
- Where is he? Where is he?
- He went down there!

1181
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:06,372
- Juice, go after him!
- I ain't goin' down there.

1182
01:19:06,372 --> 01:19:08,418
- Go on! Now!
- You're crazy. I ain't goin' down there.

1183
01:19:08,418 --> 01:19:11,629
- Watch your head.
- What is it, about 230... Whoa!

1184
01:19:11,629 --> 01:19:14,549
- Aaah!
- I'm not goin' in there.

1185
01:19:18,553 --> 01:19:21,681
- Oh, no, he didn't.
- Did you see him?

1186
01:19:21,681 --> 01:19:25,937
- Oh, no, you did just push me in the pool!
- Get out, we gotta find him!

1187
01:19:27,396 --> 01:19:28,700
What?

1188
01:19:30,190 --> 01:19:32,693
What happened?

a purpose in life. Go.

01:27:23,751 --> 01:27:26,631
I miss all the action.
Thanks.

1295
01:27:26,631 --> 01:27:30,301
- Are you okay?
- I thought you left, man.

1296
01:27:30,301 --> 01:27:34,137
No, I didn't leave. What did we say
the party needed? Ice cream, right?

1297
01:27:34,137 --> 01:27:37,601
I just went to get ice cream.
I don't know if I got the exact recipe,

1298
01:27:37,601 --> 01:27:40,352
but I think I got it close.

1299
01:27:40,352 --> 01:27:44,690
- So?
- Hey, it's pretty close.

1300
01:27:44,690 --> 01:27:50,112
Well, I guess Macintosh
is no more, huh?

1301
01:27:50,112 --> 01:27:54,285
It's too bad, because, uh,
I really enjoyed working for him.

1302
01:27:54,285 --> 01:27:58,663
- I had a good time too...
- Do me a favour?

1303
01:27:58,663 --> 01:28:01,583
Next time you see him,

1304
01:28:01,583 --> 01:28:04,921
tell him, uh,
that I'm really gonna miss him.

1305
01:28:08,967 --> 01:28:11,803
I'll miss you too, Henry.

1306
01:28:11,803 --> 01:28:15,515
You're gonna do
just fine.

1307
01:28:15,515 --> 01:28:17,644
See ya.

1308
01:28:21,606 --> 01:28:23,649
- Hey, Henry.
- Huh?

1309
01:28:23,649 --> 01:28:27,029
- Know what you have?
- What?

1310
01:28:27,029 --> 01:28:30,575
- S-T-Y-L-E, style.
- Style.

1311
01:28:33,286 --> 01:28:37,707
Hey, Preston, you're not gonna
finish this ice cream, I guess, huh?

1312
01:28:37,707 --> 01:28:41,671
Well, no sense
lettin' this go to waste.

1313
01:28:41,671 --> 01:28:44,173
So, what happened?

1314
01:28:44,173 --> 01:28:48,719
Oh, well, uh,
Macintosh wasn't...

1315
01:28:48,719 --> 01:28:52,139
He... He wasn't
who he thought he was.

1316
01:28:52,139 --> 01:28:56,269
- How do you mean?
- Well, he shouldn't have done what he did.

1317
01:28:56,269 --> 01:28:59,272
He shouldn't have
fooled everybody.

1318
01:28:59,272 --> 01:29:03,860
I think you're right.

1319
01:29:03,860 --> 01:29:07,405
It's been a long night.
Better get on up to bed.

1320
01:29:07,405 --> 01:29:09,993
Yeah, I think I ought
to get some sleep too, Dad.

1321
01:29:09,993 --> 01:29:12,787
And tomorrow, I'll tell you
all about Mr Macintosh.

1322
01:29:12,787 --> 01:29:15,498
Sleep well, Preston.

1323
01:29:15,498 --> 01:29:18,667
[Group]
Ta-da!

1324
01:29:18,667 --> 01:29:22,715
"Happy birthday to you"

1325
01:29:22,715 --> 01:29:27,303
"Happy birthday
dear Preston"

1326
01:29:27,303 --> 01:29:29,972
"Happy birthday to you"

1327
01:29:29,972 --> 01:29:32,559
Make a wish.

1328
01:29:32,559 --> 01:29:37,814
You know what they say,
"Be careful what you wish for."

1329
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:40,681
Oh.

1330
01:29:42,737 --> 01:29:46,115
What else do I want?
I mean, I got everything...

1331
01:29:46,115 --> 01:29:48,617
that I need right here.

1332
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,627
On the other hand.
