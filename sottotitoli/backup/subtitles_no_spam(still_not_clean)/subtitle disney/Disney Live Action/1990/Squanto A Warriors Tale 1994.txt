{1890}{1966}I enter the sacred circle|to give thanks for all the prayers

{2054}{2117}I come with the morning star|as my guide
{2118}{2181}and the hawk as my protector.
{2218}{2333}My father, the sachem of our people,|had a vision when I was little.
{2335}{2434}Like him, I would be a leader|and a warrior one day.
{2436}{2533}''But you will become|a different kind of leader, '' he said.
{2535}{2642}''Your eyes will see|far beyond our horizon. ''
{2643}{2721}I did not yet understand|his words of wisdom.
{2722}{2805}I did not know Mother Earth|was so much bigger than our village -
{2806}{2878}even bigger than our hunting grounds.
{2880}{2952}I only began to learn about these things
{2954}{3077}the day after beautiful Nakooma|and I became husband and wife.

{41766}{41861}What are you suggesting?|That he stay in here and eat with us?
{41862}{41945}I'm suggesting|we do not judge this feIIow.
{42004}{42096}We show him the kindness|we wouId show any stranger.

{49134}{49200}I want my Indian!
{49242}{49316}I made promises to London.
{49355}{49469}Sir George, you have the other savage.|He is very popuIar with the crowds.
{49471}{49543}I don't want popuIar! I want sensationaI!

{63445}{63552}There is no New WorId.|There is onIy this worId.
{63554}{63665}And this worId, Brother DanieI,|is not round. It is fIat!
{63667}{63707}- Oh, Brother...|- FIat!
{63709}{63765}Whatever you beIieve,|Squanto came to our country by ship.
{63766}{63826}Winter is upon us.|No ships wiII saiI before spring.
{63827}{63893}WiII you deny him sheIter, Brother PauI?|Come.
{63894}{63949}(Squanto chanting)
{63982}{64042}(all chanting)
{64317}{64376}HeavenIy Father!
{64378}{64441}HeavenIy Father...
{64442}{64548}we thank thee|for these and aII thy mercies.
{64550}{64585}Amen.
{64587}{64641}(Squanto speaking Algonquin)
{64702}{64770}- What is that word?|- KissuuIk.
{64772}{64853}- It is the name of Squanto's god.|- (men) Oh...
{64855}{65002}Ah. And what exactIy|is the function of this... god?
{65004}{65115}Squanto, teII us about KissuuIk.
{65117}{65163}He is the Creator.
{65165}{65212}(men) Ah.
{65249}{65382}TeII me, Squanto, this mysterious Iand|that you come from -
{65384}{65440}you must miss it after aII this time.
{65442}{65588}Yes, Brother PauI.|I miss my famiIy, my peopIe...
{65608}{65657}And Nakooma.
{65659}{65729}Nakooma is the name|of Squanto's bride.
{65730}{65829}Bride? You are married, Squanto?
{65830}{65868}Yes, Brother PauI.
{65870}{65920}(laughter)
{65953}{66012}Where are the women of your tribe?
{66068}{66179}We have no women, Squanto.|We have devoted our Iives to God.
{66181}{66229}Your tribe wiII die with no women.
{66231}{66321}(Brother Paul)|Squanto, we are not a tribe.
{66343}{66394}I wouId never join a tribe|with no women.
{66396}{66453}- (laughter)|- We are not a tribe.
{66506}{66590}I Ioved Nakooma|when we were chiIdren.
{66695}{66753}I miss her.
{67506}{67564}I was so fortunate|to be with the brothers,
{67566}{67661}who taught me their language,|their ways and values.
{67663}{67763}But as the seasons passed,|I got restless.
{67765}{67824}Nakooma was visiting me|in my dreams,
{67826}{67894}and I saw tears in her eyes.
{67918}{68048}I had to be with my people again soon,|or my heart would die.
{68408}{68466}(hawk cries)
{68785}{68836}For months we've been searching for him.
{68838}{68947}He must have drowned, Sir George.|It's the onIy expIanation.
{68949}{69025}That's a convenient expIanation.|If he's dead, I want proof.
{69027}{69100}- If not, keep on Iooking for him.|- Sir George, Iook at my men.
{69102}{69142}The weather's been fierce.|They've been frostbitten!
{69144}{69179}We've Iost two horses!
{69181}{69285}You Iose your position if you faiI me,|Harding. You hear me?
{69286}{69377}Your status, your income,|your reputation, your future.
{69378}{69441}This is PIymouth! I own PIymouth!
{69443}{69502}Yes, Sir George.
{69577}{69600}Who are you?
{69602}{69681}Sir George, my name is WiIIiam|Bradford, and this is Dr. SamueI FuIIer.
{69682}{69732}- Puritans.|- In search of reIigious freedom.
{69734}{69799}SeveraI of us wouId Iike|to book passage on one of your ships.
{69801}{69876}I have no objection to taking fanatics|Iike you over the sea,
{69878}{69922}but I must warn you of one thing,|gentIemen:
{69924}{69981}I don't deaI in shiIIings, I deaI in pounds.
{69983}{70048}- We have very IittIe, I'm afraid.|- Then you're wasting my vaIuabIe time.
{70050}{70105}- Mr. Dermer.|- Sir.
{70147}{70213}You're wasting your own time, too,|gentIemen.
{70214}{70299}The New WorId is no pIace|for men of peace.
{70301}{70341}You won't survive|without miIitary protection.
{70343}{70401}We have our faith,|and we are resoIute in our purpose.
{70402}{70430}(laughs)
{70432}{70511}I think you'II need a IittIe more than that,|my friends.
{70534}{70586}Ah, pork pie!
{70588}{70660}Why anyone wouId want to Ieave|EngIand, I'II never know.
{70662}{70725}Mr. Dermer, you're a man|of maps and charts.
{70727}{70857}Look at this map. Now, teII me,|where do you think Squanto wouId hide?
{70858}{70985}WeII, his tribe Iived mostIy by the ocean,|so I doubt very much he'd go inIand.
{70987}{71058}Not near any city, certainIy.|That wouId onIy terrify him.
{71060}{71125}- Ah. Mr. Harding!|- (man) Mr. Harding!
{71127}{71212}You know, you impress me, Dermer.|You seem to understand these peopIe.
{71214}{71243}You know them.
{71245}{71291}WeII, I do beIieve, sir,|that if we want to trade with them,
{71293}{71352}we shouId at Ieast try to Iearn|what we can about their cuIture.
{71354}{71440}- I can't think of anything more tedious.|- It's practicaI, Sir George.
{71442}{71516}And it's good business. Think of|aII the opportunities you've missed
{71518}{71565}by steaIing these men from their tribes.
{71566}{71638}You've made enemies instead of friends.|You can't conduct business with enemies.
{71639}{71671}But we're stronger than they are.
{71673}{71716}We can make them do anything|we want them to do.
{71718}{71786}You watched Squanto fight off|a whoIe pIatoon of armed men.
{71788}{71884}These are not compIacent peopIe, sir.|They're warriors.
{72250}{72298}(Daniel) Bibougest.
{72300}{72365}(Squanto) Hawk. BeautifuI hawk.
{72408}{72511}My friend, my protector.|He is aIways with me.
{72571}{72630}You've Iearned my Ianguage far better|than I've Iearned yours, Squanto.
{72632}{72729}For me there was no choice.|Was there, maushop?
{72915}{72965}(hawk cries)
{72984}{73043}- What is it, Squanto?|- The hawk crossed our path.
{73045}{73089}He warns us.
{73248}{73296}Who are they, Squanto?
{73400}{73457}HoId up!
{73458}{73525}Up there! FoIIow me! Come on!
{73734}{73778}Hyah!
{73949}{74044}Go on, Squanto, hide from them.|Hey! Hey! Ha!
{74228}{74312}Ya! Ya! Faster! Ya!
{74492}{74535}What's happening, Brother DanieI?
{74537}{74629}- They've come Iooking for Squanto.|- Perhaps he beIongs with the authorities.
{74631}{74732}- We mustn't teII them he's here.|- Do not ask me to Iie, Brother DanieI.
{74734}{74803}- I wiII not Iie.|- Then do not speak at aII.
{74805}{74884}You there! You're hoIding property|that doesn't beIong to you.
{74886}{74921}You, sir, are standing on private ground.
{74923}{74978}We know he's here, Friar.|Hand him over.
{74980}{75022}He's owned by|the PIymouth Shipping Company.
{75024}{75073}The PIymouth Shipping Company|has no business in this sanctuary.
{75075}{75159}This sanctuary, under Protestant Iaw,|has no business on EngIish soiI!
{75161}{75208}Search the pIace!
{75238}{75281}You, search the stabIes!
{75641}{75683}TeII me where he is!
{75685}{75740}This is a pIace of worship!
{75742}{75795}- There's nobody here...|- Get out of my way!
{75900}{75977}- This is a private monastery.|- Spare me your Iies!
{76065}{76154}PIease don't. I'm teIIing you the truth -|there's nothing here.
{76178}{76228}FoIIow me! Come on!
{76295}{76361}Tear the pIace apart!
{76397}{76440}- Squanto...|- Brother James.
{76442}{76509}- It's you that they're after. Stay hidden.|- They are hurting you.
{76510}{76601}It'II be worse for you if they find you,|my friend. Stay back.
{76643}{76771}AII right! What is the purpose of this?|These are our books, our manuscripts!
{76773}{76856}I'm out of patience|with that bIoody Indian!
{76941}{76999}- Out of my way, monk.|- I wiII not.
{77001}{77045}Out of my way!
{77047}{77071}Aah!
{77110}{77163}This is a pIace of Iearning.
{77165}{77221}Then Iet me teach you a Iesson.
{77332}{77441}Understand? The sooner you cooperate,|the sooner we stop!
{77443}{77506}We wiII cooperate.
{77810}{77869}TeII me what you want.
{77870}{77967}You know what we want, Friar.|The beast.
{77969}{78056}The wiId, wiId Indian|who Iives Iike a fiIthy animaI!
{78058}{78117}The savage! Where is he?
{78172}{78275}Savage? Beast?
{78305}{78361}FiIthy animaI?
{78682}{78782}I swear upon this hoIy book,
{78806}{78880}no one Iike that is here.
{79075}{79119}Out!
{79227}{79275}Move out!
{79421}{79481}(hawk cries)
{79483}{79561}You protected me, aII of you.
{79580}{79634}They did this to you.
{79657}{79713}Your books. Your house.
{79810}{79865}AII this was because of me.
{79867}{79924}No, Squanto.|It was because there are some peopIe
{79926}{80025}who buIIy their way through this worId|with crueIty and force.
{80026}{80075}You have no weapons to stop them.
{80077}{80143}That is not how we battIe our enemies.
{80145}{80189}Enemies destroy you!
{80190}{80295}Our books, our windows, yes.
{80297}{80365}But our spirits are stiII intact.
{80366}{80440}You do not hate the men|who did this to you?
{80442}{80529}No. We do not hate.
{80531}{80609}Hatred onIy Ieads to more hatred.
{80611}{80653}Brothers...
{80782}{80830}Thank you.
{80856}{80942}Humpty Dumpty sat on a waII.
{80944}{81025}Humpty Dumpty had a great faII.
{81026}{81111}No, no, no!|Just repeat what he says, wiII you?
{81113}{81161}Why doesn't the savage speak?
{81163}{81236}- I think perhaps it's his dignity, sir.|- Dignity, my foot!
{81238}{81307}I want an Indian|who can sing, dance, fight...
{81309}{81357}Like Squanto, the one who got away!
{81359}{81453}His reputation has been quite speciaI|since his escape from the bear pit, sir.
{81454}{81489}Has it reaIIy?
{81491}{81538}TeII me, when peopIe taIk|about the escape,
{81540}{81601}am I the object of pubIic ridicuIe?
{81603}{81632}Of course not, sir.
{81660}{81701}Give me that, you thief!
{81702}{81750}(dogs barking)
{81786}{81834}GoId.
{81836}{81865}GoId.
{81866}{81964}In my home, Capoge...
{82002}{82096}we have goId everywhere.
{82112}{82218}Did you hear what he said?|How did he Iearn to speak Iike that?
{82220}{82320}- Did you say ''goId''?|- Yes, sir.
{82322}{82352}Heave!
{82354}{82399}Ah, Mr. Dermer.
{82401}{82457}- Sir George, weIcome aboard.|- Yes, thank you.
{82458}{82537}The ship is in fine shape, isn't she, sir?|She'II be ready to saiI as pIanned.
{82539}{82629}Never been very keen on ships.|Anyway, I'm here on business.
{82630}{82715}My Indian, Epenow,|says there's goId in his country.
{82717}{82757}Opinion?
{82758}{82852}It's a vast and wondrous pIace, sir.|It's perfectIy possibIe.
{82870}{82969}Do you think if I Iet him go with you,|you couId Iure him or persuade him
{82971}{83013}to show you where the goId is?
{83015}{83120}Perhaps - in exchange for his freedom.
{83122}{83200}I couId certainIy use his heIp as weII|to trade with his tribe again.
{83202}{83231}I'm reIuctant to Iet him go
{83233}{83308}without being certain of being abIe|to repIace him by Squanto.
{83310}{83386}- I thought you'd Iocated Squanto.|- I've Iocated him, but I haven't caught him.
{83388}{83445}We need to Iure him somehow.
{83446}{83504}What in our cuIture|couId possibIy attract Squanto?
{83541}{83583}Squanto!
{83585}{83664}Squant... Squanto!
{83692}{83764}Squanto! Squanto!
{83766}{83858}Squanto... A ship! A ship!
{83860}{83908}The market... A ship...
{83910}{83994}We've been to the market and Iearned of|a ship that's Ieaving PIymouth in 1 5 days.
{83996}{84058}- What ship?|- It's caIIed the HaIf Moon.
{84060}{84164}PIymouth. PIymouth is a dangerous|pIace for you, Squanto.
{84165}{84223}AII we need to do is get him on board.
{84225}{84318}DanieI, there may not be another ship|for months. Years!
{84320}{84423}- What on earth is this?|- It's food, Brother PauI.
{84425}{84474}Food?
{84476}{84537}- It's as hard as a rock.|- It's been dried.
{84539}{84610}You pIant it in the ground.
{84612}{84654}A great big thing Iike this?
{84656}{84764}I beIieve it grows into an enormous tree.
{84806}{84888}Brothers, we haven't even prayed|this evening, and you...
{84889}{84921}- Shh!|- (crackling)
{84922}{84986}- Food is speaking.|- Oh...
{84988}{85062}Food from the New WorId speaks, does it?
{85101}{85180}(Paul) WeII, Squanto,|I doubt if you'II find many...
{85268}{85319}- Oh!|- (laughter)
{85350}{85399}EngIish!
{85434}{85461}(man) Stay back!
{85463}{85560}EngIish... you have no courage.
{85650}{85698}(Squanto chuckles)
{86163}{86266}Brothers... this is deIicious.|It's good.
{86268}{86330}Have some. Try some now.|It's good. It's reaIIy good.
{86332}{86388}- ReaIIy?|- Try it.
{86447}{86495}It is good.
{86549}{86647}If such a pIace of wonder does exist...
{86649}{86737}your heart must ache to go back to it.
{86738}{86843}Brother DanieI, you have my permission|to ride to PIymouth.
{86845}{86984}You must see Squanto safeIy|to the ship and then return.
{87218}{87317}Now, you protect these good men|the way you watched over me.
{87523}{87570}Squanto?
{87594}{87681}You haven't been fiddIing|with this fIower, have you?
{87737}{87834}WeII, you Iook quite a sight|in that sackcIoth.
{87836}{87903}TeII me, does it make you|feeI at aII Iike a monk?
{87905}{87979}I'm stiII thinking about a woman,|Brother PauI.
{87981}{88102}Oh. I must teII you something, Squanto.
{88104}{88191}I confess it's been|a stubborn weakness of mine...
{88193}{88293}I resist the possibiIity of other worIds,
{88294}{88384}other customs, other points of view.
{88406}{88534}Sometimes I overIook|the goodness in a man
{88536}{88644}even when it's staring me in the face.
{88646}{88753}Go in peace. You have my bIessing.
{88773}{88841}Thank you, Brother PauI.
{89305}{89381}Take this as a gift from my heart.
{91488}{91536}( lively music)
{91911}{92018}Mr. Epenow has figured out how|to avoid a whipping, eh, Mr. Harding?
{92020}{92091}Very IiberaI of you to give him|his freedom, Sir George.

{92542}{92597}No, Squanto. No.

{95112}{95169}You were the taIk of the town.
{95170}{95243}There is indeed a ship Ieaving|for your homeIand.
{95245}{95296}It Ieaves PIymouth tomorrow at noon.
{95298}{95360}Your friend Epenow|wiII be on board that ship.

{95574}{95633}You wiII do whatever I teII you to do.
{95634}{95756}Obey me and you'II be treated fairIy.|Disobey me and you'II be punished.
{95829}{95909}There is a divine order to Iife.
{95910}{96021}First there's God,|foIIowed by the angeIs, then the king...
{96023}{96095}Then the rest of us|according to our position in the worId.
{96097}{96218}Your position, Indian,|is Iower than the animaIs.
{96220}{96313}You're not a human being.|You're Iivestock.
{96576}{96611}Harding!
{96613}{96717}Make very sure you keep him|bound and guarded at aII times.
{96718}{96819}- Of course, Sir George.|- Just Iike my friend here, Epenow.

{104374}{104435}Brother DanieI!
{104437}{104491}Brother DanieI!
{104606}{104657}Thank you!
{105238}{105307}You won the trust of the EngIish,|Epenow.
{105328}{105368}The EngIi...
{105399}{105519}(quietly) The EngIish are greedy.|I promised them goId.
{105814}{105871}Where is this goId?
{105976}{106055}I've Iearned many things|from the EngIish.
{106092}{106148}One of them was how to Iie.
{106173}{106260}I Iearned from them, too.|I found friends among them.
{106262}{106310}(horse neighs)
{106389}{106504}Our friends are the peopIe|that we are going home to.
{106505}{106570}The Nausets and the Patuxets.
{106616}{106716}I am IoyaI to my peopIe. And my famiIy.
{106717}{106853}And my son.|Pequod wiII be a great sachem one day.
{106855}{106942}I too am IoyaI to my peopIe and famiIy.
{106944}{107052}And my bride, Nakooma.|But new friends do not threaten my IoyaIty.
{107054}{107161}Then you are a fooI, Squanto.|The white man is not your friend.
{107163}{107224}He wiII onIy betray you.
{107329}{107432}My father taught me|to let my heart be my guide.
{107433}{107541}From the brothers, I learned|to keep my spirit, even in pain.
{107543}{107619}Epenow's words left me concerned.
{107644}{107700}Land ho!
{107710}{107736}Epenow!
{107738}{107811}I was almost home.|My heart was longing for the moment
{107813}{107877}when I would hold Nakooma|in my arms again
{107879}{107973}and my family would gather|around the fire to celebrate my return.
{108012}{108141}But our ship sailed into Nauset Bay,|the place of Epenow's people,
{108142}{108213}a few days away from my village.
{108516}{108621}Stow your oars now.|Keep your eyes peeIed onshore.

{110881}{110931}Just a IittIe one. Come on.|Come on!
{110933}{111023}For God's sakes, man, remember|your manners! You're a guest here.
{111089}{111148}She's just a bIoody savage anyway.
{111695}{111757}(distant shouts and whooping)
{112286}{112338}What have you done?
{112391}{112443}This is not our way!
{112445}{112536}No, it is not our way!|It is the way of the EngIish!
{112537}{112567}Aah!
{112613}{112706}You weIcome them to your viIIage and|now you sIaughter them as the enemy?
{112708}{112767}They came to our Iand to trade,
{112769}{112834}then they took us away|and treated us Iike animaIs!
{112836}{112889}You have punished a good man|for other men's crueIty!
{112891}{112954}I kiIIed them because I am a warrior!
{112956}{113052}- You have forgotten who you are!|- I have not forgotten!
{113077}{113143}Go back to your viIIage, Squanto...
{113145}{113216}and see what the EngIish|have brought to your peopIe.
{113218}{113292}Then judge me for what I have done.

{115913}{115989}Nakooma!
{116385}{116444}(bell chiming)
{117209}{117290}I began to understand Epenow's rage.
{117309}{117366}All of my people were dead,
{117368}{117452}killed by the sickness|brought by the English.
{117490}{117549}My heart was bleeding.
{117551}{117629}Nakooma's tears still haunted me.
{117630}{117749}The playful laughter of my people|still echoed through the village.
{117751}{117898}Now I would wear their ashes|and carry their spirits with me.
{117949}{118033}I had become a sachem without a tribe.
{118073}{118153}The English would come again -|I knew that.
{118155}{118236}And I promised the Great Spirit|to be the warrior
{118237}{118312}my father had seen in his vision.
{119230}{119284}Dr. FuIIer, Mr. Bradford!
{119285}{119333}(bell chimes)
{119372}{119418}Look at this.
{120267}{120345}We're safe here.|Protected on aII sides.
{120346}{120400}I suggest we bury our dead|before we settIe in.
{120401}{120502}I stiII feeI uneasy about this decision.|This is someone eIse's home.
{120504}{120575}God has guided us here.|This wiII be our home.
{120577}{120672}- But what if they come back?|- They wiII be met with resistance.
{120673}{120721}That is what you pay me for.

{124422}{124471}You two, come with me.
{124946}{125025}Carver, make sure the women|and chiIdren are secure.
{125026}{125085}I want every man of yours|armed and ready.
{125086}{125155}Mr. Bradford, couId you|bring the rosewater, pIease?
{125157}{125202}We shouId try to make contact|with these peopIe first.
{125204}{125245}We must show them we mean no harm.
{125246}{125313}I wiII not aIIow my men|to be used as target practice.
{125314}{125376}If we do not show strength now,|then aII is Iost.
{125377}{125476}Mr. Standish is right. We've Iived|too Iong under fear and persecution.
{125477}{125533}I say we fight for what shouId be ours.
{125534}{125579}Think of what you're saying, Mr. Carver.
{125581}{125652}Are we to be the same|as those who persecuted us in EngIand?
{125654}{125742}- ShouId we commit murder?|- Bradford, I am preventing murder.
{125744}{125804}I shaII do what is necessary.
{125826}{125897}I want aII men to enforce the barricade!
{127309}{127359}Squanto! (speaks Algonquin)
{127432}{127480}What has to be done.

{127789}{127868}- ( Carver) Shoot him.|- (Bradford) No, wait.
{128023}{128091}- Shoot him.|- Mr. Carver, he's unarmed.
{128093}{128147}(Squanto) Enough!

{128204}{128285}Too much bIood on this Iand.|Too many tears.
{128287}{128324}It's a trick.
{128326}{128401}AII of my peopIe have died here.

{136404}{136460}And so began a time of harmony

{136558}{136649}We who knew the land taught|those who had come from far away

{136708}{136809}At harvest we came together|to give thanks.
