1
00:02:11,733 --> 00:02:15,018
Jill! Jill!

2
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,730
Jill, what did I tell you?

3
00:02:21,867 --> 00:02:25,449
- But Joe started it.
- Well, it's not good for them to interact with us.

4
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:28,365
Besides, that wasn't Joe,
that was Marley.

5
00:02:28,498 --> 00:02:32,910
- No, it wasn't. It was Joe.
- Joe is just a baby, Jill.

6
00:02:33,044 --> 00:02:37,088
- He's too big to be Joe.
- Check. Check the pictures.

7
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:37,627
Hey. I said into bed.

8
00:03:37,752 --> 00:03:39,791
I am in bed.

9
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,665
Jill, what made you think
that that gorilla we saw today was Joe?

10
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,041
- I was right, wasn't I?
- Yeah.

11
00:03:47,177 --> 00:03:50,877
My notes say that Joe
is only six months old.

12
00:03:51,014 --> 00:03:54,429
Either I got confused
or Joe is a very unusual gorilla.

13
00:03:54,517 --> 00:03:58,134
- I told you so.
- Yeah, you did.

14
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:02,350
And Mommy's gonna write in her journal
that my trusted colleague, Dr. Jill Young...

15
00:04:02,482 --> 00:04:04,889
showed me the error of my ways.

16
00:04:06,652 --> 00:04:08,728
Now go to sleep.

17
00:04:31,424 --> 00:04:34,378
Excuse me, Doctor.

18
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,882
- Night, Kweli.
- Good night, Jilly.

19
00:04:37,013 --> 00:04:39,682
- What is it, Kweli?
- You must come quickly.

20
00:04:42,142 --> 00:04:45,143
- Mommy, can I come?
- Stay here, sweetheart.

21
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,940
- But I want to go.
- No, no, no, no, no, no. No.

22
00:04:52,068 --> 00:04:54,558
You stay here, child.

23
00:04:59,074 --> 00:05:02,074
- Poachers.
- East of the village.

24
00:05:18,466 --> 00:05:20,008
They're at it again.

25
00:05:20,134 --> 00:05:23,337
N'Gai Zamu.
Mystical monsters.

26
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:26,803
There is only one thing you should be
afraid of on this mountain...

27
00:05:26,932 --> 00:05:30,549
and it's staring you right in the face.

28
00:05:30,685 --> 00:05:33,555
Gorilla. Fresh.

29
00:05:33,688 --> 00:05:36,060
We're close.

30
00:05:42,445 --> 00:05:45,232
We've gotta stop them.
Everybody spread out.

31
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:34,442
- Get the baby.
- Give me the bag.

32
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:40,113
Don't worry.
We want you alive.

33
00:06:59,717 --> 00:07:00,463
Garth!

34
00:07:00,593 --> 00:07:03,262
Garth! Kill him!

35
00:07:03,387 --> 00:07:05,842
Joe!

36
00:07:08,767 --> 00:07:10,759
Give me the gun!

37
00:07:29,076 --> 00:07:32,611
Joe? Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh!

38
00:07:34,915 --> 00:07:37,240
She's got to be here somewhere.

39
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:40,578
The woman's
got that damn devil with her.

40
00:07:40,712 --> 00:07:42,953
But I think you might have shot her.

41
00:07:43,089 --> 00:07:48,379
These people want to live like heroes.
Let them die like heroes.

42
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:55,390
Oh! Oh! That little demon took off
my thumb and trigger finger.

43
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:00,510
What if you shot the woman?
We should help her.

44
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,638
No. Let's get out of here.

45
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:05,857
Yeah. That looks bad. Better get back
before you bleed to death.

46
00:08:05,984 --> 00:08:09,317
I will kill this little monkey.
I swear I will kill him!

47
00:08:09,445 --> 00:08:13,905
- You'll never play the violin again, that's for sure.
- Shut up!

48
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,782
- Mommy!
- Jill.

49
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:28,587
Mommy!

50
00:08:28,712 --> 00:08:31,417
Jill.

51
00:08:31,548 --> 00:08:34,833
- Mom, there were men and they...
- I know. I know.

52
00:08:34,968 --> 00:08:37,505
I know, darling. I know.

53
00:08:39,222 --> 00:08:41,463
Are you okay, Mommy?

54
00:08:45,811 --> 00:08:49,144
Oh, look who's here.
Hello, Joe.

55
00:08:51,608 --> 00:08:55,023
- He's scared.
- I know.

56
00:08:55,152 --> 00:08:58,936
Poor baby.
He lost his mommy tonight.

57
00:09:04,536 --> 00:09:09,078
He needs someone to protect him.
Will you do that for me?

58
00:09:10,499 --> 00:09:13,666
Promise me you'll protect him.

59
00:09:13,794 --> 00:09:16,878
I promise.

60
00:10:35,449 --> 00:10:39,114
Jill! Jill!

61
00:10:46,209 --> 00:10:49,044
Come on, Joe. Come on.

62
00:11:50,849 --> 00:11:55,427
- You must be Pindi.
- The one and only, bro. Come.

63
00:12:00,316 --> 00:12:04,859
Six men, three cars. That's
everything you asked for, Mr. O'Hara.

64
00:12:04,987 --> 00:12:08,605
All paid for in advance
out of Pindi's own pocket.

65
00:12:11,034 --> 00:12:13,738
These guys wouldn't be poachers.

66
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:16,989
I asked for experienced trackers.

67
00:12:17,123 --> 00:12:21,452
These men are the best.
I assure you, the very best.

68
00:12:24,087 --> 00:12:27,088
Let's get this show on the road.

69
00:12:30,384 --> 00:12:34,049
Hey, you've got a nice piece here.
What are we hunting? Elephants?

70
00:12:34,179 --> 00:12:37,299
- We're not hunting anything.
- Aha. Tranquillizer darts.

71
00:12:37,432 --> 00:12:39,888
I agree.
Much nicer to animals than bullets.

72
00:12:40,018 --> 00:12:42,591
- Your men know how to use these, right?
- Oh, sure, boss.

73
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:45,765
We only have professionals here.

74
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:49,942
So, you tell me.
Where are we going today?

75
00:12:54,066 --> 00:12:56,687
- There.
- There?

76
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:03,441
That's not such a good mountain, boss.
The men don't like it very much at all.

77
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:06,326
You see, there is a legend they believe
in that a creature lives there.

78
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,951
N'Gai Zamu,
sacred guardian of Mount Pangani.

79
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:15,536
They say any man who enters his domain
is never heard of again.

80
00:13:15,668 --> 00:13:19,037
You know it?

81
00:13:19,171 --> 00:13:20,831
How strange.

82
00:13:20,965 --> 00:13:24,214
That's not, by any chance,
what you're looking for, is it, boss?

83
00:13:24,343 --> 00:13:26,964
Looking for a legend?

84
00:13:28,221 --> 00:13:31,222
Why would I want to do that?

85
00:13:52,909 --> 00:13:54,985
What are you listening to?

86
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,527
Sounds.

87
00:13:57,664 --> 00:14:01,163
Hmm. I understand.
Sounds of the jungle.

88
00:14:03,169 --> 00:14:06,288
I know a guy, he can get you
a CD of jungle sounds cheap.

89
00:14:06,421 --> 00:14:08,330
Even cheaper if you...

90
00:14:08,465 --> 00:14:10,837
Come on. Come on. Let's go.

91
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:27,013
See, boss? I told you
these men were the best.

92
00:14:27,148 --> 00:14:29,639
Oh!

93
00:14:32,861 --> 00:14:34,984
You're a beauty.

94
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,331
Okay, set him free.

95
00:14:54,172 --> 00:14:56,841
Why bring a cage
if you're not keeping the animal?

96
00:14:56,966 --> 00:14:59,836
'Cause I'm only taking this.

97
00:14:59,969 --> 00:15:01,878
Yes.

98
00:15:02,012 --> 00:15:05,796
Yes, but, um,
I know a guy in Botswana.

99
00:15:05,932 --> 00:15:09,266
He'd pay you 10,000 American dollars
for that leopard.

100
00:15:09,394 --> 00:15:12,597
Now, I'm willing
to split with you 50-50.

101
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:15,850
Put him in the truck.

102
00:15:15,983 --> 00:15:19,316
Put the cat down now.

103
00:15:19,444 --> 00:15:22,362
You heard him!
Put the cat down!

104
00:15:27,285 --> 00:15:29,158
They never understand me.

105
00:16:23,918 --> 00:16:26,491
- Excuse me, but I think it's time to leave.
- Don't move!

106
00:16:26,629 --> 00:16:29,120
I'm not moving, but my bowels are.

107
00:16:29,256 --> 00:16:32,541
Don't run. Stay still.

108
00:17:16,923 --> 00:17:19,675
Come on! He's getting away!

109
00:17:19,801 --> 00:17:23,383
- Come on! We're going after him!
- What do you mean, "we"?

110
00:17:23,512 --> 00:17:26,596
There's no way my men will risk
their lives with something like this.

111
00:17:26,724 --> 00:17:30,139
I'll triple your pay.

112
00:17:41,236 --> 00:17:44,605
Don't use the tranqs
unless I give the signal.

113
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:48,357
Okay, when we catch up to him,
I want you men to herd him towards me!

114
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:53,903
Now, one second, one second.
Herd him towards us? Why?

115
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:59,199
I gotta be close to get a blood sample.
Real close.

116
00:18:27,861 --> 00:18:30,696
No, no, don't shoot! No!

117
00:18:40,539 --> 00:18:42,496
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

118
00:18:50,965 --> 00:18:54,583
- They'll live.
- Bet you provide a great health plan.

119
00:18:57,471 --> 00:19:00,637
Look at the way he moves!
Magnificent!

120
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:03,885
Watch out!

121
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:13,316
- You stupid fool!
- Come on. We're gonna lose him.

122
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:15,898
Come on. Let's go!

123
00:19:22,576 --> 00:19:25,612
What the hell is that guy tryin' to do?

124
00:19:27,914 --> 00:19:30,868
Hey! Hey!

125
00:20:10,577 --> 00:20:12,783
I can't see him.
He's gone, long gone.

126
00:20:12,912 --> 00:20:16,411
No, no, he's coming out on the other side
of those trees. We gotta get in front of him.

127
00:20:24,506 --> 00:20:26,545
There he is!

128
00:20:32,054 --> 00:20:33,679
What's he...

129
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:40,136
Get down!

130
00:21:38,988 --> 00:21:41,906
Did you see that?
Did you see what he did?

131
00:21:42,033 --> 00:21:44,109
Yes. Yes.

132
00:21:44,243 --> 00:21:46,449
He picked up the chain.
Did you see the intelligence?

133
00:21:46,578 --> 00:21:49,994
Yes, I saw the intelligence!
He almost took my head off!

134
00:21:57,463 --> 00:22:02,255
- Hurry up, bro. Let's go.
- Get these men down the mountain and bandaged up.

135
00:22:02,384 --> 00:22:05,800
- You're not coming with us?
- Are you kidding?

136
00:22:05,929 --> 00:22:08,135
Crazy American.
Okay!

137
00:23:21,287 --> 00:23:23,078
Joe! Joe!

138
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:27,826
- Joe!
- Help!

139
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,952
Joe, stop!

140
00:23:33,298 --> 00:23:36,133
Hey, can you get him
to put me down?

141
00:23:39,095 --> 00:23:41,301
Joe, drop him.

142
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:58,570
- Where am I?
- The infirmary.

143
00:23:58,695 --> 00:24:01,186
You've been unconscious
for an entire night.

144
00:24:01,323 --> 00:24:05,071
- You're lucky to be alive.
- I don't feel very lucky.

145
00:24:05,201 --> 00:24:08,534
You crashed your vehicle.
It's waiting for you outside.

146
00:24:08,662 --> 00:24:11,034
You're an injury behind.

147
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:16,241
The kicker was getting
dropped on my head by N'Gai Zamu.

148
00:24:17,962 --> 00:24:20,749
Oh, you think that's funny?
You oughta try it.

149
00:24:20,882 --> 00:24:24,215
N'Gai Zamu is just a legend,
my friend.

150
00:24:24,343 --> 00:24:28,839
No, he's a giant gorilla
with a mean backhand.

151
00:24:28,972 --> 00:24:31,807
Wait. There was a woman.

152
00:24:31,933 --> 00:24:33,724
- A woman.
- Out in the jungle.

153
00:24:33,851 --> 00:24:36,093
A beautiful woman.
She saved my life.

154
00:24:36,229 --> 00:24:39,099
I think it would be wise for you
to see a doctor in Kimanjay.

155
00:24:39,231 --> 00:24:41,473
I took the liberty
of calling one for you.

156
00:24:41,608 --> 00:24:44,562
- Don't need one.
- But he's expecting you.

157
00:24:44,694 --> 00:24:49,688
If you can drive,
I think it's best that you leave today.

158
00:25:18,891 --> 00:25:24,644
Our visitor must be feeling better.
He should leave the infirmary by today.

159
00:25:24,771 --> 00:25:27,606
Looks like he already has.

160
00:25:27,732 --> 00:25:31,979
He's walking so soon?
Joe should've dropped him harder.

161
00:25:32,111 --> 00:25:35,112
He's not a poacher, Jill.

162
00:25:35,239 --> 00:25:39,283
The man works for animal conservancy
in California.

163
00:25:41,369 --> 00:25:43,860
He can't be trusted.
He's an outsider.

164
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:01,129
He said he was saved yesterday
by... by a woman.

165
00:26:01,262 --> 00:26:03,504
A beautiful woman.

166
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:11,597
And what did you tell him?

167
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:17,850
What can I tell him, Jill? The man
knows what he saw. He's not a fool.

168
00:27:53,695 --> 00:27:58,440
Hey, big guy.
How are ya? Hmm?

169
00:28:01,869 --> 00:28:06,115
What were you doin' stompin' around,
lookin' for trouble yesterday, huh?

170
00:28:06,248 --> 00:28:10,660
You're not supposed to
let people see you, remember?

171
00:28:10,793 --> 00:28:15,834
Don't do that again, okay?
Please.

172
00:28:15,965 --> 00:28:18,336
Please.

173
00:28:22,554 --> 00:28:25,922
You wanna play? Okay.

174
00:28:26,057 --> 00:28:29,093
You ready?

175
00:28:30,477 --> 00:28:34,522
One, two...

176
00:28:34,648 --> 00:28:40,104
three, four, five...

177
00:28:40,236 --> 00:28:44,696
six, seven, eight, nine, ten!

178
00:28:46,408 --> 00:28:48,566
Ready or not, here I come.

179
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:55,080
Joe!

180
00:28:55,208 --> 00:28:59,786
Where are you, big fella?
I'm coming to get you.

181
00:29:03,006 --> 00:29:05,248
Oh, my.

182
00:29:05,383 --> 00:29:08,752
I wonder where Joe can be.

183
00:29:10,346 --> 00:29:13,181
Come out, wherever you are.

184
00:29:13,307 --> 00:29:15,845
I found you!

185
00:29:15,976 --> 00:29:19,760
Yes. Yes, I did.

186
00:29:19,896 --> 00:29:23,229
Yeah.
Tryin' to hide from me.

187
00:29:29,655 --> 00:29:32,572
You wanna go and find me?
Okay.

188
00:29:32,699 --> 00:29:34,941
Close your eyes.

189
00:29:35,076 --> 00:29:37,911
Ready? Go.

190
00:30:21,534 --> 00:30:23,491
Come on, Joe.

191
00:30:33,128 --> 00:30:35,499
Nice monkey.

192
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:37,373
Joe.

193
00:30:41,677 --> 00:30:44,464
Joe, it's okay.

194
00:30:44,596 --> 00:30:46,754
Joe, run. Get out of here.

195
00:30:58,859 --> 00:31:02,523
Thanks. Hide-and-seek's
not really my game.

196
00:31:03,905 --> 00:31:06,775
Anything broken?

197
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:09,908
No. No, I think I'm...
Hey, thanks.

198
00:31:11,954 --> 00:31:14,076
- I think it's okay.
- Oh, good.

199
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:15,450
- I think it's still working.
- Oh, great.

200
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:17,788
- I can fix that for you.
- No, wait...

201
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:24,084
Hey, w-where you goin'?
W- W-Wait a minute!

202
00:31:24,214 --> 00:31:26,456
Hey, hold on a second.
What's the problem?

203
00:31:26,592 --> 00:31:28,216
You. You're the problem.

204
00:31:28,343 --> 00:31:30,501
This is the second time
I've saved you from being killed.

205
00:31:30,637 --> 00:31:32,713
Next time I'm just gonna watch.
You understand?

206
00:31:32,847 --> 00:31:36,631
Okay. A-All right.
You saved me, and I'm grateful.

207
00:31:36,767 --> 00:31:38,973
Thank you, Miss Young.

208
00:31:39,103 --> 00:31:41,807
I know who you are.
You're Ruth Young's daughter.

209
00:31:41,938 --> 00:31:44,643
Did she know about Joe?
Did she have a theory on him?

210
00:31:44,774 --> 00:31:46,814
How did you keep him a secret
all these years?

211
00:31:46,943 --> 00:31:49,066
By keeping people like you
off this mountain.

212
00:31:49,195 --> 00:31:51,733
People like me?
I- I wanna help you.

213
00:31:51,864 --> 00:31:54,864
You go back to where you came from
and tell them what you saw...

214
00:31:54,992 --> 00:31:57,447
this place will be crawling
with people.

215
00:31:57,577 --> 00:32:01,491
That's gonna happen anyway.
Look, I'm not the only one who saw him.

216
00:32:01,623 --> 00:32:04,078
An animal as rare as Joe
means big money.

217
00:32:04,208 --> 00:32:08,040
It's gonna be tough trying to
protect him here. Maybe impossible.

218
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:11,420
Here is where he lives.
He doesn't have a choice.

219
00:32:11,548 --> 00:32:14,502
That's not true. The people I work for
could take care of Joe.

220
00:32:14,634 --> 00:32:16,543
They have the facilities.

221
00:32:16,678 --> 00:32:19,714
A cage?
That's just what Joe needs.

222
00:32:19,847 --> 00:32:21,721
No, no, not a cage.
A preserve.

223
00:32:21,849 --> 00:32:25,052
A place where he'll be free...
free from poachers, land developers.

224
00:32:25,185 --> 00:32:28,186
- A place he'll be safe.
- But he won't be free.

225
00:32:30,023 --> 00:32:33,023
How long do you think
he can stay free here?

226
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:37,230
The next people who come
are gonna be coming to hunt Joe down.

227
00:32:44,869 --> 00:32:48,072
Quite an impressive facility
you have here, Mr. Strasser.

228
00:32:48,205 --> 00:32:49,664
- Thank you.
- Tell me.

229
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:54,119
Why is it that you keep such a
low profile about this wonderful place?

230
00:32:54,252 --> 00:32:58,415
Our only interest
is the well-being of our animals.

231
00:32:58,548 --> 00:33:03,375
Well, I think I've come
to the right place for Morris.

232
00:33:03,511 --> 00:33:06,262
I'm sure you have.

233
00:33:07,639 --> 00:33:10,759
He's grown out of his habitat
and...

234
00:33:10,892 --> 00:33:13,727
well, our zoo just doesn't have
the budget to do anything about it.

235
00:33:13,853 --> 00:33:19,439
- That's why he needs a new home.
- That's the telephone for you, Mr. Strasser. It's urgent.

236
00:33:19,566 --> 00:33:22,235
- Will you excuse me, Mr. Anderson?
- Sure.

237
00:33:22,361 --> 00:33:24,898
I'll be back.

238
00:33:28,324 --> 00:33:33,365
Garth, see what the market is
for the organs of this lovely panda.

239
00:33:33,495 --> 00:33:36,579
- Ooh, big fella. We should get a lot.
- Strasser.

240
00:33:36,707 --> 00:33:39,624
It's about time. Do you know
how long I've been waiting?

241
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:44,662
- What do you want, Pindi?
- Not what I want, boss. What you want.

242
00:33:44,797 --> 00:33:46,955
How about a giant gorilla?

243
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:50,424
- Talk.
- As big as three men.

244
00:33:50,552 --> 00:33:55,095
- Two thousand pounds, at least.
- You've been drinking, haven't you?

245
00:33:55,223 --> 00:34:00,015
I swear to God, boss, I saw him
with my own two eyes. He's... He's huge!

246
00:34:00,144 --> 00:34:01,935
Don't waste my time, Pindi.

247
00:34:02,938 --> 00:34:04,847
Hello? Boss?

248
00:34:04,982 --> 00:34:08,184
Two-thousand pound gorilla.
He's crazy.

249
00:34:29,253 --> 00:34:32,040
Stupid girl. What do you think
you are doing? Huh?

250
00:34:32,172 --> 00:34:34,331
I found this in the forest
this morning.

251
00:34:34,466 --> 00:34:37,751
Thought maybe you dropped it
and might want it back!

252
00:34:37,886 --> 00:34:40,637
Poaching's illegal!
Get off this mountain.

253
00:34:43,266 --> 00:34:45,174
Jill.

254
00:34:45,309 --> 00:34:48,642
Jill, I need to talk to you.
Jill...

255
00:34:52,774 --> 00:34:54,647
Murderer.

256
00:35:15,294 --> 00:35:18,460
Your mother slept in this bed.
She worked at this desk.

257
00:35:18,588 --> 00:35:22,253
She died in this jungle. Do you plan
to do everything just like her?

258
00:35:22,383 --> 00:35:24,755
My mother would've been proud
of what I did today.

259
00:35:24,886 --> 00:35:29,512
Proud? Of this foolishness out there?
Proud of you risking your life?

260
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:33,258
She risked hers.
Why shouldn't I risk mine?

261
00:35:33,393 --> 00:35:37,687
Kweli, I'm just trying to keep a promise
here, and I promised to take care of Joe.

262
00:35:37,814 --> 00:35:40,518
And I will do everything it takes
to stop those poachers.

263
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:43,436
You cannot stop them.

264
00:35:43,569 --> 00:35:46,688
Even she could not stop them.

265
00:35:46,822 --> 00:35:51,816
The other gorillas, they have moved
south to safer lands. Joe stays behind.

266
00:35:51,951 --> 00:35:55,865
They won't accept him.
Joe needs me.

267
00:36:00,042 --> 00:36:02,367
The danger here is building
for both of you.

268
00:36:02,502 --> 00:36:05,787
I feel it, and so do you.

269
00:36:07,215 --> 00:36:10,548
I know what the American
is offering, Jill.

270
00:36:10,676 --> 00:36:14,294
Consider it.
That's all I ask.

271
00:37:01,137 --> 00:37:04,553
- Leaving?
- Yeah, I'm heading up into the mountains.

272
00:37:04,682 --> 00:37:08,265
See if I can throw
some of those dirtbags off Joe's trail.

273
00:37:08,394 --> 00:37:10,719
- Think it will work?
- Not for long.

274
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:12,847
I'm just tryin' to buy you some time.

275
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:17,856
I suggest you get Joe as deep into the
jungle as you can, as fast as you can.

276
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:23,233
- Okay.
- Okay what?

277
00:37:23,365 --> 00:37:27,279
- Okay, we'll go with you.
- We?

278
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:31,278
Me and Joe, we'll go with you to that,
that place of yours in California.

279
00:37:31,414 --> 00:37:34,699
- You sure about this?
- No, I'm absolutely not sure about this.

280
00:37:34,834 --> 00:37:37,372
- But I'll do this on one condition.
- Name it.

281
00:37:37,503 --> 00:37:39,994
- I'm in charge of Joe.
- Done.

282
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:41,411
- "Done"?
- Done.

283
00:37:41,548 --> 00:37:44,004
- Just like that?
- Just...

284
00:37:45,635 --> 00:37:48,173
- You're not very trusting, are you?
- No, I'm not.

285
00:37:48,304 --> 00:37:51,305
It must be tough for you, then,
trying to measure me up...

286
00:37:51,432 --> 00:37:54,598
- trying to decide if I'm full of it or...
- Or just a fool?

287
00:37:54,727 --> 00:37:58,344
I guess we'll just have to
figure it out as we go along.

288
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,228
Look, what do you want me to say?
You'll be in charge of Joe. Okay?

289
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:06,980
Come on.
We'll shake on it.

290
00:38:07,112 --> 00:38:12,189
I don't shake. That's not how
we make pacts around here.

291
00:38:12,325 --> 00:38:15,112
All right, how do you
make pacts around here?

292
00:38:15,245 --> 00:38:18,613
You have to endure a bite
from a Makiki spider.

293
00:38:18,748 --> 00:38:21,748
- A what?
- You'll have a high fever, hallucinations.

294
00:38:21,876 --> 00:38:26,288
You'll say things, lots of things.
I'll hear what's in your heart.

295
00:38:26,421 --> 00:38:30,584
Then, if your intentions prove true,
then we have a pact.

296
00:38:30,717 --> 00:38:33,966
Spider bite and hallucinations?

297
00:38:34,095 --> 00:38:35,921
That's right.

298
00:38:36,055 --> 00:38:38,546
Then you'll trust me to take you
and Joe to California with me?

299
00:38:38,682 --> 00:38:41,351
Absolutely.

300
00:38:43,103 --> 00:38:45,475
Well, what do you say?

301
00:38:46,856 --> 00:38:50,770
I say that's the biggest load of crap
I ever heard in my whole life.

302
00:38:52,569 --> 00:38:55,855
Maybe you're not a fool after all.

303
00:39:01,744 --> 00:39:03,986
Get your things together fast.

304
00:39:04,121 --> 00:39:07,205
We're gettin' out of here
as soon as we can.

305
00:39:10,252 --> 00:39:12,825
Makiki spider.

306
00:39:42,113 --> 00:39:46,110
I don't know what else to do, Joe.

307
00:39:46,242 --> 00:39:48,400
I just want you to be safe.

308
00:40:35,452 --> 00:40:38,571
- You think he's okay back there?
- He's doing fine.

309
00:40:38,705 --> 00:40:41,326
Okay.

310
00:40:41,457 --> 00:40:43,616
I'm sorry.
I'm just a little tense.

311
00:40:48,172 --> 00:40:50,662
You think he's okay back there?

312
00:40:50,799 --> 00:40:54,084
- I think he's okay back there.
- Good.

313
00:40:54,219 --> 00:40:58,086
So this is L.A., huh?
Everything looks the same.

314
00:40:58,222 --> 00:41:00,215
- How do you know where you are?
- It's easy.

315
00:41:00,349 --> 00:41:02,388
The ocean's that way,
the mountains are that way...

316
00:41:02,518 --> 00:41:05,091
Mexico's that way
and Canada's that-a-way.

317
00:41:05,228 --> 00:41:08,644
You don't have to worry about the rest.
You'll never see it through the smog.

318
00:41:10,566 --> 00:41:13,733
Maybe you'd better check and see
if Joe's okay back there.

319
00:41:51,019 --> 00:41:52,727
Mom! M-Mom!

320
00:42:16,208 --> 00:42:19,125
Main gate to Dr. Banks.
They're pulling up now.

321
00:42:19,252 --> 00:42:24,838
I copy that. Okay, everybody!
Elvis is in the building!

322
00:42:36,726 --> 00:42:40,059
- He's big!
- Did you see him?

323
00:42:40,187 --> 00:42:44,398
- The fun begins.
- You hear that, Harry? They smell him.

324
00:42:44,525 --> 00:42:47,442
Who, Gregg or the gorilla?

325
00:42:53,491 --> 00:42:56,444
All right, I'm a little confused,
O'Hara, because you phoned us...

326
00:42:56,577 --> 00:42:58,783
- to say you're bringing back a 2,000-pound
animal... - Hello, Harry. Hiya, gorgeous.

327
00:42:58,912 --> 00:43:00,905
- Welcome back, Gregg.
- But security tells me...

328
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:03,197
you requested no fire hoses
and no restraints of any kind. So what...

329
00:43:03,333 --> 00:43:05,871
- Come on, let me introduce you to somebody.
- Well, how are we supposed to control this animal?

330
00:43:06,002 --> 00:43:07,793
With a giant rolled-up newspaper?

331
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,336
- Jill Young, - Hi. - I'd like you to
meet Dr. Harry Ruben, who runs the place.

332
00:43:11,465 --> 00:43:13,623
- Nice to meet you. - Hi.
- And Dr. Cecily Banks...

333
00:43:13,759 --> 00:43:16,428
- who makes sure he doesn't screw it up.
- Hi. Nice to meet you both. - Hi. Hi.

334
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:21,888
Hold on, big guy. I'm comin'.

335
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:28,018
I think he's ready to come out.

336
00:43:28,146 --> 00:43:31,064
Harry, I think it's time you met Joe.

337
00:43:33,943 --> 00:43:36,399
I know it looks small,
but this is just the entrance.

338
00:43:36,529 --> 00:43:39,565
- He has the entire hill to roam.
- Okay.

339
00:43:39,698 --> 00:43:41,857
Jack, Vern, what, are we gonna
have to hose you guys down too?

340
00:43:41,992 --> 00:43:44,364
- Come on, get the sedatives ready.
- No, no, no.

341
00:43:44,494 --> 00:43:46,985
- We don't need any of that. He... That...
- Miss Young, don't worry. We know what we're doing here.

342
00:43:47,122 --> 00:43:48,497
- But what... I... - The best way to
handle... - Hey, hey, wh... Hold on.

343
00:43:48,623 --> 00:43:51,956
Harry, you and I had an agreement.
The lady's in charge of Joe.

344
00:43:52,084 --> 00:43:56,295
- Well, how is she gonna handle...
- Easy, tiger. Come on.

345
00:43:56,421 --> 00:43:58,793
Calm down. Come on.

346
00:43:58,924 --> 00:44:01,379
- Okay, guys, I got it.
- All right.

347
00:44:01,509 --> 00:44:03,383
You sure you got everything
under control?

348
00:44:03,511 --> 00:44:07,425
Yeah. Come on.

349
00:44:07,556 --> 00:44:10,177
- You sure she knows what she's doing?
- She knows.

350
00:44:10,309 --> 00:44:13,345
You want me to come in there
and get you?

351
00:44:13,478 --> 00:44:16,811
There you go. Come on.

352
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:19,893
Come look at your new home.

353
00:44:20,026 --> 00:44:23,026
Come on. There you go.

354
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:34,955
Come on, Joe.
Come on. Come on.

355
00:44:47,175 --> 00:44:49,665
Hey, come on, Vern. What am I
paying you for? Get some pictures.

356
00:44:49,802 --> 00:44:51,960
- All right.
- And get me in there too.

357
00:44:52,096 --> 00:44:54,421
You know, for perspective.

358
00:45:02,146 --> 00:45:05,017
Okay. It's okay, Joe.

359
00:45:06,317 --> 00:45:10,528
Hey. Hey, Joe, come on.
Nothing happened.

360
00:45:10,654 --> 00:45:13,773
You're not scared of those people,
are you?

361
00:45:13,907 --> 00:45:17,774
I promise nothing
will happen to you, okay?

362
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:20,911
- Come on, Joe.
- Come on, Joe. Come on.

363
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:28,285
Okay, there you go.
Yeah, you big guy.

364
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:31,539
Come on, Joe.

365
00:45:31,672 --> 00:45:34,377
There you go.
Come on, big guy.

366
00:45:34,508 --> 00:45:36,880
Come on.

367
00:45:49,647 --> 00:45:52,054
- I think he's gonna be fine.
- I'm glad.

368
00:45:52,191 --> 00:45:54,266
Jack, let's move that platform
out of there, okay?

369
00:45:54,401 --> 00:45:57,318
- Oh, no. I'm going back in there with him.
- Oh, no, no, I'm sorry. We can't allow that.

370
00:45:57,445 --> 00:46:00,066
You see, we don't have insurance to cover
anyone in there who's not an employee.

371
00:46:00,198 --> 00:46:02,688
- You're not serious.
- But... But I'm supposed to be in charge of Joe.

372
00:46:02,825 --> 00:46:05,826
Yes, you are,
and I'm in charge of this facility.

373
00:46:05,953 --> 00:46:08,325
Let's go. Take it up.

374
00:46:13,001 --> 00:46:15,040
Okay, swing it up.

375
00:46:15,169 --> 00:46:19,581
"And I'm in charge of this facility. "
I mean, who does he think he is?

376
00:46:19,715 --> 00:46:23,664
I bet that man has never spent
one night outside in his entire life.

377
00:46:23,802 --> 00:46:25,260
Probably not.

378
00:46:25,387 --> 00:46:28,387
Well, here are your new
deluxe accommodations.

379
00:46:28,514 --> 00:46:32,179
I should be out there with Joe,
not here, not in this...

380
00:46:34,144 --> 00:46:36,350
this cage.

381
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:40,975
Look, I know how you feel. It's not
exactly my idea of home, sweet home either.

382
00:46:41,109 --> 00:46:43,682
But at least you're close to Joe.

383
00:47:46,083 --> 00:47:47,992
- Doin' a lot better.
- Oh. - Where's Gregg?

384
00:47:48,126 --> 00:47:50,795
Talk to you later. I-I don't know.
You know, he collected his paycheck.

385
00:47:50,921 --> 00:47:54,040
He's probably in some jungle by now
looking for giant sheep.

386
00:47:54,173 --> 00:47:57,376
Well, I think he should be here.
I mean, this is his discovery.

387
00:47:57,510 --> 00:48:00,676
Excuse me. Gregg's expertise
is crashing Humvees.

388
00:48:00,804 --> 00:48:04,588
It's not explaining primate behavior to
the chairman of the conservancy board.

389
00:48:04,724 --> 00:48:07,262
You know what I think, Harry?
I think you're jealous.

390
00:48:07,393 --> 00:48:09,220
I'm crippled with envy, yes.

391
00:48:09,354 --> 00:48:14,264
I mean, you know, just once I wanted to
go into the field and find a new species.

392
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:18,479
- You know? Anything. A mollusk.
- Here we go.

393
00:48:18,612 --> 00:48:21,281
- Huh. - Harry.
Dr. Banks. - Hi.

394
00:48:21,406 --> 00:48:23,398
So, let's go see him.

395
00:48:23,533 --> 00:48:28,278
See, the gorillas in the Pangani carry this recessive
gene that pops up every four or five generations...

396
00:48:28,412 --> 00:48:30,369
- Huh.
- With this rare form of gigantism.

397
00:48:30,497 --> 00:48:32,324
And that's where the legend comes from.

398
00:48:32,457 --> 00:48:36,455
But I knew it was more than a legend,
so I followed my gut instinct.

399
00:48:36,586 --> 00:48:38,911
I just had a hunch
that this thing was true.

400
00:48:39,046 --> 00:48:42,380
- Pretty damn sharp, Harry.
- All right, here we are.

401
00:48:45,761 --> 00:48:49,379
- Pretty cool, huh?
- My, my, I should say so.

402
00:48:52,809 --> 00:48:56,011
- Where is he?
- Um...

403
00:48:56,145 --> 00:48:58,896
Uh, Joe!

404
00:48:59,022 --> 00:49:01,311
Come here, Joe!

405
00:49:04,527 --> 00:49:06,899
Come here, boy!

406
00:49:08,698 --> 00:49:10,820
Gorillas. There's never one around
when you need 'em.

407
00:49:10,950 --> 00:49:15,410
- Even for the chairman of the board.
- Well, I came here to see him.

408
00:49:15,537 --> 00:49:17,909
You know what? Maybe... Maybe...
You know what? I'll feed him.

409
00:49:18,039 --> 00:49:19,533
- That'll... That'll get him to come out.
- Um, Harry...

410
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:21,658
No, no, no. No, no. Don't worry.
I know what I'm doing.

411
00:49:21,793 --> 00:49:25,872
Elliot, you stay here.
I'm gonna go open the gate. Okay?

412
00:49:26,005 --> 00:49:29,705
Silver, brown, blond, white. There are
nine different colors to choose from.

413
00:49:29,841 --> 00:49:34,052
And naturally, Ron, you have to ask
things like toxicity. Uh, is it safe?

414
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:36,136
This product has been tested
for ten years.

415
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:39,467
It's not just a colored spray,
like some of you might be thinking.

416
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:45,435
It's just a plain, ordinary cosmetic,
and it just washes out in the evening.

417
00:49:56,281 --> 00:49:57,823
- I was coming to get you.
- What's that noise?

418
00:49:57,950 --> 00:50:00,321
The security alarm in Joe's habitat.
Come on!

419
00:50:10,294 --> 00:50:13,497
- Joe... Joe... - What's happening?
- He's been... He's going crazy!

420
00:50:13,630 --> 00:50:16,880
Open the gate!

421
00:50:17,008 --> 00:50:18,550
Open it! Open it!

422
00:50:24,848 --> 00:50:27,220
- Hold it! Don't shoot!
- No!

423
00:50:38,527 --> 00:50:40,982
Oh, God.

424
00:50:41,113 --> 00:50:43,948
- Harry, it's okay.
- It doesn't feel okay.

425
00:50:44,074 --> 00:50:47,359
Listen to me.
Just jump out from behind the trees.

426
00:50:47,493 --> 00:50:50,494
No... No, I'd rather not.

427
00:50:50,621 --> 00:50:54,120
Just jump out and say,
"You found me. "

428
00:50:54,249 --> 00:50:56,823
Well, he knows he's found me!
That's the problem!

429
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:00,660
Harry, do what she says.

430
00:51:02,757 --> 00:51:05,461
You found me!

431
00:51:18,938 --> 00:51:22,638
Oh, God!
He's playing with him.

432
00:51:22,775 --> 00:51:25,396
Harry, he's playing with you.

433
00:51:25,527 --> 00:51:27,650
- Hide-and-seek.
- What?

434
00:51:27,779 --> 00:51:30,151
Shh. Watch.

435
00:51:31,699 --> 00:51:35,068
Joe! Where are you?

436
00:51:35,202 --> 00:51:40,029
Now, where could Joe be?
Here he is!

437
00:51:40,165 --> 00:51:43,664
- Feeding time over, Harry? - You wanted
me to find you, didn't you? - Very funny.

438
00:51:43,793 --> 00:51:47,078
Good thing Joe didn't
want to play doctor.

439
00:51:47,213 --> 00:51:53,333
Look at you, all happy. Huh, Joe?
That makes me so happy.

440
00:51:53,468 --> 00:51:55,924
- Harry.
- You know what? That never happened before.

441
00:51:56,054 --> 00:51:59,921
- Th... It was weird, wasn't it, the way...
- Put that girl in charge of the gorilla.

442
00:52:00,058 --> 00:52:01,967
Elliot,
she has no scientific training.

443
00:52:02,101 --> 00:52:05,801
That ape is the best fund-raising tool
this conservancy has ever had.

444
00:52:05,938 --> 00:52:08,429
He's happy, I'm happy.

445
00:52:08,565 --> 00:52:10,522
So you really think
that she's gonna be able to, you know...

446
00:52:10,650 --> 00:52:15,146
- Put her on the payroll, Harry.
- Okay.

447
00:52:15,279 --> 00:52:17,651
- Did you see that? Did you see that?
- I saw it.

448
00:52:17,782 --> 00:52:19,608
- He was playing hide-and-seek with him!
- It's great.

449
00:52:19,742 --> 00:52:23,324
Oh, my God!
You were right. He likes it here.

450
00:52:27,082 --> 00:52:31,328
Oh, my God! On his second day,
he's playing! He likes it here!

451
00:52:35,915 --> 00:52:39,118
- You got it bad.
- What are you talking about?

452
00:52:39,252 --> 00:52:41,707
- You know what I'm talking about.
- No, no, no, no, no.

453
00:52:41,837 --> 00:52:45,372
Usually you are out the door
as soon as the animal's in its habitat.

454
00:52:45,507 --> 00:52:48,508
You have a very active imagination.

455
00:52:48,635 --> 00:52:50,674
- I don't think so.
- Oh, I think so.

456
00:52:50,804 --> 00:52:52,962
No, I don't think so.

457
00:52:53,097 --> 00:52:57,177
I think Mr. World Traveler
has goo-goo eyes for the gorilla girl.

458
00:52:58,606 --> 00:53:03,766
Just close your eyes, and then he's gonna do
that, and then you say, "You found me!" Come on!

459
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:09,280
Behind me is the habitat
of what the experts are calling...

460
00:53:09,408 --> 00:53:13,571
one of the world’s most important
zoological finds of this century.

461
00:53:13,703 --> 00:53:17,451
This is the home of what is believed
to be the world's largest primate...

462
00:53:17,581 --> 00:53:21,032
a 2,000-pound gorilla named Joe.

463
00:53:21,168 --> 00:53:25,794
Joe has been at the California Animal
Conservancy for a little over a month now.

464
00:53:25,922 --> 00:53:29,255
He was brought here from Africa
by Dr. Gregory O'Hara...

465
00:53:29,384 --> 00:53:31,672
- who told me that because of Joe's remarkable size...
- My God.

466
00:53:31,802 --> 00:53:35,420
- Pindi was right.
- He is a natural target for poachers.

467
00:53:35,556 --> 00:53:38,093
Fortunately, the California
Animal Conservancy's programme...

468
00:53:38,225 --> 00:53:42,092
- He's beautiful.
- Is rescuing animals and bringing them here so they...

469
00:53:42,228 --> 00:53:44,386
It's the most beautiful animal
I ever seen.

470
00:53:44,522 --> 00:53:47,439
And the most valuable,
that's for sure.

471
00:53:47,566 --> 00:53:49,938
And he can't escape
because it's surrounded by a moat...

472
00:53:50,068 --> 00:53:53,354
and there are also some electrical wires
around the entire perimeter.

473
00:53:53,488 --> 00:53:55,564
- Isn't that the... - Wait. Be quiet.
- Joe was raised from infancy...

474
00:53:55,698 --> 00:53:59,648
by Jill Young, the daughter of
famed primatologist Ruth Young.

475
00:53:59,785 --> 00:54:02,703
Their closeness stems
from a tragic bond.

476
00:54:02,830 --> 00:54:06,578
Both Joe's and Jill's mothers
were killed by poachers 12 years ago...

477
00:54:06,708 --> 00:54:08,499
- Bloody hell! That's him!
- In the Pangani forest.

478
00:54:08,627 --> 00:54:10,952
They both became orphans
on the same night.

479
00:54:11,087 --> 00:54:13,838
That's him! That's the little fella
who bit your finger off!

480
00:54:17,301 --> 00:54:21,345
I'm always amazed how...

481
00:54:21,471 --> 00:54:24,306
if you wait long enough...

482
00:54:24,432 --> 00:54:28,726
the opportunity for justice
finally comes.

483
00:54:28,853 --> 00:54:32,138
Garth, book us
two tickets to America.

484
00:54:32,272 --> 00:54:35,143
We are going to pay a visit
to this incredible animal.

485
00:54:35,275 --> 00:54:39,853
I think I know how to convince
his current owners to part with him.

486
00:54:45,451 --> 00:54:50,029
Now, this fellow is one of only
300 wild yaks remaining on the planet.

487
00:54:50,163 --> 00:54:54,659
Now, you may ask: Why should we care
if this subspecies of yak survives?

488
00:54:54,792 --> 00:54:58,624
- But if we don't protect...
- Excuse me. Uh, could we see Joe?

489
00:54:58,754 --> 00:55:01,210
- Yeah. We want to meet Joe.
- Yes, you can certainly all see Joe...

490
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:05,586
for the mere price of a diamond circle
benefactor ticket to tomorrow night's benefit.

491
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:10,214
But, you know, this is for a good cause. It's
for the preservation of endangered species.

492
00:55:58,766 --> 00:56:01,387
You remember, don't you?

493
00:56:13,529 --> 00:56:16,529
So this is what you call
a good meal in a fine restaurant?

494
00:56:16,656 --> 00:56:18,779
Yeah.

495
00:56:18,908 --> 00:56:23,036
It's my favorite restaurant,
'cause they let you take off your shoes.

496
00:56:27,708 --> 00:56:31,919
My granddad used to bring me fishing
down here when I was a kid.

497
00:56:32,045 --> 00:56:34,832
Wow. The Pacific Ocean.

498
00:56:37,592 --> 00:56:39,999
That's nice. Live music.

499
00:56:40,136 --> 00:56:43,172
I hired him special.

500
00:56:43,305 --> 00:56:46,010
Ten minutes ago.
You want to dance?

501
00:56:46,141 --> 00:56:50,185
What? So, this is a date
or something?

502
00:56:50,311 --> 00:56:53,312
Not that I'd know.
I've never been on one before.

503
00:56:53,439 --> 00:56:56,475
Yeah, well, I guess most guys
are afraid of a girl's father.

504
00:56:56,608 --> 00:57:00,558
I can just see a guy telling Joe
he's gonna get you home by midnight.

505
00:57:00,695 --> 00:57:04,942
Well, nobody's ever had to tell Joe
what time they'll have me home by.

506
00:57:10,037 --> 00:57:12,195
What's it like?

507
00:57:12,331 --> 00:57:14,122
- "Lt"?
- Yeah.

508
00:57:14,249 --> 00:57:19,076
This whole dating,
dancing, love thing.

509
00:57:19,212 --> 00:57:21,667
Well, it's...

510
00:57:21,797 --> 00:57:24,466
kinda like being bit
by a Makiki spider.

511
00:57:27,553 --> 00:57:31,419
- And how's that?
- You get kind of a fever.

512
00:57:31,556 --> 00:57:34,806
A fever. Ah. And then?

513
00:57:34,934 --> 00:57:40,604
And then you... you find yourself
saying things, lots of things.

514
00:57:40,731 --> 00:57:42,474
What kind of things?

515
00:57:42,607 --> 00:57:44,647
Things like...

516
00:57:51,949 --> 00:57:54,985
- What is it?
- I'm sorry. It's this thing.

517
00:57:57,412 --> 00:57:58,906
We gotta go.

518
00:58:11,425 --> 00:58:13,464
I don't understand this animal.

519
00:58:13,593 --> 00:58:16,713
- He's got everything he wants. - Harry,
stop... Ohh! - Why can't he just relax?

520
00:58:16,846 --> 00:58:18,803
He's ripping out saplings,
bam, bam, bam!

521
00:58:18,931 --> 00:58:20,425
- He's ripping out irrigation pipes.
- Oh! Really?

522
00:58:20,558 --> 00:58:22,550
- One big yank, here comes the flood.
- Oh, no.

523
00:58:22,685 --> 00:58:25,140
- What happened? What's wrong with him?
- We don't know! Jill, do you?

524
00:58:25,270 --> 00:58:28,224
Is he okay?

525
00:58:29,774 --> 00:58:33,190
- Can you get in there and calm him down...
- Joe! - Before he relandscapes the habitat?

526
00:58:42,786 --> 00:58:45,359
Joe. It's okay.

527
00:58:54,254 --> 00:58:57,124
It's okay.

528
01:00:29,547 --> 01:00:32,084
- Impossible.
- Please.

529
01:00:32,216 --> 01:00:34,422
I wouldn't be asking you
to postpone the benefit...

530
01:00:34,551 --> 01:00:36,923
unless I thought there was something
really wrong with Joe.

531
01:00:37,053 --> 01:00:39,176
And I do.

532
01:00:40,348 --> 01:00:43,882
From what I hear, you sang him to sleep
last night like a baby.

533
01:00:44,018 --> 01:00:46,390
What's really wrong
about that?

534
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:51,347
Mr. Baker, I swear to you,
Joe is still not himself.

535
01:00:51,483 --> 01:00:53,440
He's... He's nervous and agitated...

536
01:00:53,568 --> 01:00:56,106
and he shouldn't be exposed
to a crowd of strangers right now.

537
01:00:56,237 --> 01:00:59,107
Look, if you can just please
delay the party just a few more...

538
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:01,316
- It's too late, Jill.
- No!

539
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:09,112
- It's too soon.
- Miss Young, let me give you some advice:

540
01:01:09,249 --> 01:01:11,241
Stop worrying about Joe...

541
01:01:11,375 --> 01:01:14,744
and start worrying about what
you'll wear to the party tonight.

542
01:01:34,438 --> 01:01:36,975
Cecily? Oh, I'm sorry.

543
01:01:37,107 --> 01:01:40,807
No, my fault. Excuse me.

544
01:01:40,943 --> 01:01:43,897
- Yes?
- It's just...

545
01:01:45,948 --> 01:01:49,399
- What?
- You must be Jill Young.

546
01:01:50,702 --> 01:01:52,741
Yes?

547
01:01:52,871 --> 01:01:55,242
And you look just like her.

548
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:59,830
- Who?
- Your mother.

549
01:02:04,881 --> 01:02:08,297
- You knew my mother?
- Yes.

550
01:02:08,426 --> 01:02:11,510
I'm an old friend
of your mother's.

551
01:02:11,637 --> 01:02:15,551
I knew her when she was, uh,
only a little older than you.

552
01:02:15,682 --> 01:02:18,255
And you were just a tiny thing.

553
01:02:19,477 --> 01:02:24,139
- What an incredible woman she was.
- Yeah.

554
01:02:24,273 --> 01:02:27,025
I'm sorry.
I'm Andre Strasser.

555
01:02:27,151 --> 01:02:30,899
I've come here
to talk with your Mr. Baker.

556
01:02:31,029 --> 01:02:34,694
- Actually, I'm here for Joe.
- Joe?

557
01:02:34,824 --> 01:02:37,149
And, in a way,
for your mother too.

558
01:02:37,285 --> 01:02:39,242
I believe
she would agree with me.

559
01:02:39,370 --> 01:02:43,154
A magnificent wild animal
like Joe needs more space...

560
01:02:43,290 --> 01:02:46,207
like the Raja Preserve
I run in Botswana.

561
01:02:46,334 --> 01:02:48,623
Raja Preserve?

562
01:02:48,753 --> 01:02:53,545
It's 20,000 acres there
where the animals are free to run.

563
01:02:53,674 --> 01:02:59,048
Here it's such a shame to see Joe
living in a man-made habitat...

564
01:02:59,179 --> 01:03:02,133
and being used as an attraction
to raise money.

565
01:03:03,641 --> 01:03:05,800
But I upset you.

566
01:03:05,935 --> 01:03:07,892
- No.
- Please.

567
01:03:08,020 --> 01:03:10,725
I only mean
to offer an alternative.

568
01:03:12,816 --> 01:03:16,814
Anyway, here is my card.

569
01:03:16,945 --> 01:03:19,780
I'll be attending, uh,
the event tonight.

570
01:03:19,906 --> 01:03:22,906
Maybe we can talk more
about this matter then.

571
01:03:23,034 --> 01:03:25,868
I look forward to it.

572
01:03:25,995 --> 01:03:27,952
Yeah. Bye.

573
01:03:39,173 --> 01:03:41,249
Boy, I can't believe
all the V.I.P. S here tonight.

574
01:03:41,383 --> 01:03:44,337
Ooh, don't you clean up nice?

575
01:03:44,469 --> 01:03:47,589
- Cecily, you look ravishing.
- Thank you.

576
01:03:47,722 --> 01:03:51,422
Harry, you got a little, um,
cocktail sauce on your shirt there.

577
01:03:51,559 --> 01:03:54,595
Oh, great.
Now I look ridiculous.

578
01:03:54,728 --> 01:03:58,773
No, you look fine.
They look ridiculous.

579
01:03:58,899 --> 01:04:01,105
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah, well, she doesn't.

580
01:04:12,744 --> 01:04:15,413
I picked out the dress.
Aren't I smart?

581
01:04:15,538 --> 01:04:17,614
Brilliant.

582
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,123
Harry, you're dripping again.

583
01:04:21,252 --> 01:04:23,743
Oh, look at me.
I'm like a mess here.

584
01:04:23,879 --> 01:04:27,793
You know, I have to give a speech
tonight. You-You think anyone'll notice?

585
01:04:27,924 --> 01:04:30,130
No.

586
01:04:31,261 --> 01:04:33,253
Hi.

587
01:04:33,388 --> 01:04:36,341
I feel so stupid
in this dress.

588
01:04:36,474 --> 01:04:40,518
You look anything but stupid.
Come on. Let's get a drink.

589
01:04:41,687 --> 01:04:43,726
She reminds me of somebody...

590
01:04:43,855 --> 01:04:46,809
but I can't think who it is.

591
01:04:46,941 --> 01:04:48,898
You, when we first met.

592
01:04:50,152 --> 01:04:52,228
Why are they staring at me?

593
01:04:52,363 --> 01:04:56,989
They're not staring at you. They're
staring at, uh, that banana tower.

594
01:04:58,326 --> 01:05:02,240
- Very funny.
- Come on.

595
01:05:02,371 --> 01:05:05,491
- That's what I said.
- Is that right?

596
01:05:06,625 --> 01:05:09,828
It's nice to see you all.
Good evening.

597
01:05:09,962 --> 01:05:12,796
- Quite a turnout.
- All the better.

598
01:05:12,922 --> 01:05:16,836
Ladies and gentlemen, would you
please take your seats? Please.

599
01:05:16,968 --> 01:05:19,375
Can I have your attention,
please?

600
01:05:19,512 --> 01:05:21,919
Can I... Can I have your attention,
please? Just take your seats.

601
01:05:22,056 --> 01:05:24,593
Ooh, I'm sorry. Oh.

602
01:05:24,725 --> 01:05:27,096
Excuse me, sir, you, uh...
you dropped your, uh...

603
01:05:27,227 --> 01:05:29,350
- Key chain.
- Ah, of course.

604
01:05:29,479 --> 01:05:33,523
Garth, you would lose your head
if it wasn't screwed on.

605
01:05:33,649 --> 01:05:35,606
- Nice party, huh?
- Yeah.

606
01:05:35,734 --> 01:05:38,818
- Can I have your attention, please? Just take your seats.
- Where do we think he's from?

607
01:05:38,946 --> 01:05:42,528
- I don't know.
- I'm Elliot Baker.

608
01:05:42,657 --> 01:05:45,611
The world was once a garden
teeming with life.

609
01:05:45,743 --> 01:05:49,787
A wondrous place to contemplate
creation in all its...

610
01:06:00,923 --> 01:06:04,256
Tonight you'll meet one secret
that would not remain hidden.

611
01:06:10,348 --> 01:06:13,302
- So, you haven't forgotten me?
- Please, can I have your attention?

612
01:06:13,434 --> 01:06:17,930
- As you can hear, this secret announced itself loud and clear.
- Good.

613
01:06:18,063 --> 01:06:20,471
- In fact...
- Have you forgotten this?

614
01:06:34,536 --> 01:06:38,154
How much do you think he's worth,
couple of million?

615
01:06:38,290 --> 01:06:41,907
After we sell him off,
piece by piece...

616
01:06:42,043 --> 01:06:44,249
who knows how much we'll make?

617
01:06:47,715 --> 01:06:52,672
- That got you going. Now be a good boy and frighten the ladies.
- If I could just have your attention...

618
01:06:52,803 --> 01:06:58,425
- Please, can I have your attention? Well, our guest seems to be telling you that I'm talking too long.
- Okay, let's go.

619
01:06:58,558 --> 01:07:03,717
- We've done our job here.
- I'd like to bring up to the podium the director of our conservancy...

620
01:07:07,149 --> 01:07:11,312
Well, I suppose there's no need
to add to that introduction.

621
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:13,602
Here's Dr. Harry Ruben!

622
01:07:18,867 --> 01:07:21,951
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

623
01:07:22,078 --> 01:07:24,118
In the time it took you
to drive here tonight...

624
01:07:24,247 --> 01:07:28,114
three species have disappeared
from the Earth.

625
01:07:28,251 --> 01:07:31,833
Extinct.
Never to be replaced.

626
01:07:33,255 --> 01:07:35,662
We here at the conservancy
say this is a tragedy...

627
01:07:38,093 --> 01:07:41,177
Well, uh,
obviously Joe agrees.

628
01:07:41,304 --> 01:07:44,304
- There's something wrong.
- But, um...

629
01:07:44,432 --> 01:07:48,215
tonight, instead of focusing
on what we've lost...

630
01:07:48,352 --> 01:07:51,969
we'd like to introduce you
to something that we've found.

631
01:07:52,105 --> 01:07:56,398
Ladies and gentlemen, behind
this curtain is the newest member...

632
01:07:56,526 --> 01:07:59,230
of the California Animal
Conservancy.

633
01:07:59,361 --> 01:08:03,145
We are very happy and proud
to introduce to you...

634
01:08:03,282 --> 01:08:05,238
Mighty Joe...

635
01:08:15,417 --> 01:08:18,584
Joe?

636
01:08:18,712 --> 01:08:20,704
It's okay.

637
01:08:22,298 --> 01:08:25,334
Come on, Joe.

638
01:08:29,888 --> 01:08:32,095
No! Joe!

639
01:08:50,532 --> 01:08:53,105
- My God, what's wrong with him?
- He's out of control!

640
01:08:53,242 --> 01:08:56,576
- I'm going for the tranq gun!
- No, Gregg! I'll stop him!

641
01:09:06,004 --> 01:09:08,791
Oh, my God!

642
01:09:09,924 --> 01:09:11,881
Move!

643
01:09:22,852 --> 01:09:25,769
Oh, God.

644
01:09:51,252 --> 01:09:53,494
The gorilla literally
crashed the party.

645
01:09:53,629 --> 01:09:55,668
Officials here at the conservancy
are saying...

646
01:09:55,798 --> 01:09:58,633
they don't know what caused
the animal's rampage.

647
01:09:58,759 --> 01:10:00,917
More than a dozen people
were injured.

648
01:10:01,052 --> 01:10:03,377
Eight of them remain
hospitalized today.

649
01:10:03,513 --> 01:10:05,671
In fact, three lawsuits
have been filed so far...

650
01:10:05,807 --> 01:10:10,183
and word has it the city's attorney is
calling for the animal to be put to sleep.

651
01:10:10,311 --> 01:10:13,430
Standing with me is the conservancy
board's chairman, Elliot Baker.

652
01:10:13,563 --> 01:10:17,810
Exactly what is being done to assure
the public that Joe won't attack again?

653
01:10:17,942 --> 01:10:22,520
Joe has been transferred to a special
steel-reinforced concrete bunker.

654
01:10:22,655 --> 01:10:27,115
- But what about when you let him out?
- That won't be happening any time soon.

655
01:10:27,242 --> 01:10:30,278
In fact, I want to make it clear
that we will be doing...

656
01:10:30,412 --> 01:10:33,780
anything necessary to ensure
the safety of the public.

657
01:10:33,915 --> 01:10:38,078
Mr. Baker, with the number of lawsuits
that the conservancy is now facing...

658
01:10:38,210 --> 01:10:41,127
will you shut down the facility
to the public?

659
01:10:42,339 --> 01:10:44,296
Joe.

660
01:10:48,094 --> 01:10:50,549
I'm right here. Okay?

661
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:57,887
I knew there was
something wrong with him.

662
01:10:58,019 --> 01:11:01,269
What do you think
happened out there?

663
01:11:01,397 --> 01:11:05,146
Joe would have never hurt
those people unprovoked.

664
01:11:05,276 --> 01:11:08,146
Something must've got to him.

665
01:11:13,158 --> 01:11:15,446
Jill?

666
01:11:15,577 --> 01:11:18,494
Could I, um... Could I
talk to you for a second?

667
01:11:36,428 --> 01:11:39,299
Well, this wasn't
in the brochure, was it?

668
01:11:47,980 --> 01:11:50,222
I promised you wouldn't be
put in a cage.

669
01:11:53,819 --> 01:11:55,610
I'm sorry, Joe.

670
01:12:36,815 --> 01:12:40,943
And then the city attorney talked to Baker. So, this
wasn't my decision. I had nothing to do with this.

671
01:12:41,069 --> 01:12:43,026
Nothing to do with what?

672
01:12:43,154 --> 01:12:46,688
Joe's gonna have to stay in here until
they decide what they're gonna do with him.

673
01:12:46,824 --> 01:12:48,698
- In here?
- Yeah.

674
01:12:48,826 --> 01:12:52,408
Harry, look at him.
He's depressed. He won't eat.

675
01:12:52,537 --> 01:12:54,909
If he stays in here,
he'll die within days.

676
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:57,744
Jill, there is nothing we can do
about this.

677
01:12:57,875 --> 01:13:01,291
Listen, Harry, either you tell them
you're getting Joe out of here, or I will.

678
01:13:01,420 --> 01:13:04,041
Don't you understand?
This is way beyond you and me.

679
01:13:04,173 --> 01:13:06,331
Joe freaked out on some
very influential people.

680
01:13:06,466 --> 01:13:08,423
Now he's a public relations
nightmare.

681
01:13:08,552 --> 01:13:11,837
No zoo will take
a 2,000-pound killer gorilla!

682
01:13:11,971 --> 01:13:14,177
- He's not a killer!
- Okay, okay.

683
01:13:14,307 --> 01:13:16,679
But unless you can write a cheque
for millions of dollars...

684
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:18,801
and-and-and find him
a big backyard somewhere...

685
01:13:18,936 --> 01:13:20,893
then Joe's got nowhere to go.

686
01:13:21,021 --> 01:13:23,476
I'm sorry.

687
01:13:24,691 --> 01:13:27,478
Harry.

688
01:13:28,653 --> 01:13:30,894
You're not gonna do anything?

689
01:13:56,636 --> 01:13:58,344
I need your help.

690
01:14:04,184 --> 01:14:06,307
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

691
01:14:06,436 --> 01:14:09,187
- Hey, you can't go in there.
- It's okay. We're here to give Joe more sedatives.

692
01:14:09,314 --> 01:14:12,647
- Wha... I, uh...
- Hey, unless you want him to get frisky on your shift...

693
01:14:12,775 --> 01:14:17,235
I suggest you let us get on with our job
so you can get on with yours.

694
01:14:33,377 --> 01:14:36,626
Come on, Joe.
We're leaving.

695
01:14:36,755 --> 01:14:40,004
Yeah. Let's get you
out of here.

696
01:14:41,342 --> 01:14:43,630
What the hell are you doin'?

697
01:14:45,596 --> 01:14:49,379
The gorilla needs his medication, and I've
gotta take him over to the clinic for that.

698
01:14:49,516 --> 01:14:52,967
- Who says?
- Doctor's orders, and I'm the doctor.

699
01:14:53,102 --> 01:14:56,436
Yeah, well, uh,
I take my orders from Mr. Baker...

700
01:14:56,564 --> 01:14:59,055
so, uh, put him back
in his cage now.

701
01:15:00,234 --> 01:15:02,392
Easy, Joe, easy.

702
01:15:03,862 --> 01:15:06,898
Officer, you don't want to point
that thing at him, believe me.

703
01:15:13,996 --> 01:15:15,787
He didn't believe you.

704
01:15:29,968 --> 01:15:32,174
Okay, come on!
Bring him out!

705
01:15:40,603 --> 01:15:43,010
Come on, big guy.
Come on.

706
01:15:55,282 --> 01:15:58,485
Come on, Joe.
Into the truck.

707
01:15:58,619 --> 01:16:00,576
That's it.

708
01:16:03,456 --> 01:16:05,781
Okay.

709
01:16:07,001 --> 01:16:08,958
Thanks.

710
01:16:17,927 --> 01:16:20,632
I am gonna miss
those big ol' brown eyes.

711
01:16:23,099 --> 01:16:25,257
You be good, Joe.

712
01:16:25,392 --> 01:16:28,097
Goodbye, Joe.

713
01:16:28,228 --> 01:16:31,229
I was just starting to get
the hang of hide-and-seek.

714
01:16:34,192 --> 01:16:38,652
I, uh... I think you should be
all right up here at the gate.

715
01:16:38,779 --> 01:16:43,156
Someone, uh, just called
the guard away. Urgent business.

716
01:16:44,784 --> 01:16:47,358
You came through for us, Harry.

717
01:16:49,831 --> 01:16:52,452
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

718
01:16:58,505 --> 01:17:01,920
You be sure to write us as soon
as you get Joe settled, okay?

719
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:05,584
I promise.

720
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:07,629
Okay. You're all set.

721
01:17:07,763 --> 01:17:11,132
So, you're gonna
come to the airport, or...

722
01:17:11,266 --> 01:17:14,551
No, I'm gonna hang back and make sure
nobody notices Joe's gone.

723
01:17:14,686 --> 01:17:17,805
Give you guys a chance
to make a run for it.

724
01:17:17,939 --> 01:17:20,097
Okay.

725
01:17:20,233 --> 01:17:24,693
Well, if you're ever in Botswana and feel like
taking me out for a good meal at a fine restaurant

726
01:17:24,820 --> 01:17:28,900
That is, if you're not too afraid
to let Joe know what time you'll be...

727
01:17:39,541 --> 01:17:42,826
Jill, we should go now.
The plane is waiting.

728
01:17:44,713 --> 01:17:46,835
Come. Let's go.

729
01:17:46,964 --> 01:17:49,004
- Gotta go.
- Yeah.

730
01:17:49,133 --> 01:17:51,090
Okay.

731
01:18:05,314 --> 01:18:07,639
- Hello.
- Hi.

732
01:18:13,822 --> 01:18:18,234
Don't worry, Jill.
Soon Joe will be back home again.

733
01:18:27,917 --> 01:18:32,793
So, what do you think? How many minutes
before the whole world knows he's missing?

734
01:18:32,922 --> 01:18:37,085
Five. How many minutes before we're
both looking through the want ads?

735
01:18:37,217 --> 01:18:39,459
Six.

736
01:18:41,429 --> 01:18:44,762
- What are you guys doin' here?
- What are you guys doin' here?

737
01:18:44,891 --> 01:18:47,595
Baker wants us
to clean up the tent A.S.A.P.

738
01:18:47,727 --> 01:18:51,344
Yeah, you should see some of the stuff
we found in the post-party melee.

739
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:56,604
We've got the fun job of figuring out who all this
stuff belongs to. Somebody's head is very cold right now.

740
01:18:56,735 --> 01:19:00,269
Look at this. What is this thing, eh?
Hey, come on. Look.

741
01:19:02,281 --> 01:19:06,065
- Where did you find this?
- By the habitat. Oh, God, we gotta find those two guys.

742
01:19:06,201 --> 01:19:10,151
- Oh, yeah. - What two guys? - What's that...
that one guy, he was, what, Lithuanian.

743
01:19:10,288 --> 01:19:12,696
- Russian.
- Yeah, Russian. Eastern European.

744
01:19:12,832 --> 01:19:16,331
- Is everything okay?
- That thing's used by poachers!

745
01:19:23,467 --> 01:19:27,380
- Please, be careful.
- Always worrying, huh?

746
01:19:27,512 --> 01:19:30,003
Your mother was a worrier too.

747
01:19:30,139 --> 01:19:33,673
Always worrying
about the gorillas.

748
01:19:35,185 --> 01:19:40,096
It made her a lot of enemies.
It led to tragedy.

749
01:19:41,566 --> 01:19:44,187
My mother was brave.

750
01:19:44,318 --> 01:19:46,311
So are you, my dear.

751
01:19:54,911 --> 01:19:57,912
What? It's not pretty.
I know.

752
01:19:59,081 --> 01:20:01,489
I'm sorry.

753
01:20:01,625 --> 01:20:03,914
How did it happen?

754
01:20:06,421 --> 01:20:11,248
Well, you could say
I had an encounter with a monster.

755
01:20:19,016 --> 01:20:23,095
That little demon took off my thumb
and trigger finger!

756
01:20:42,846 --> 01:20:46,012
Come on, come on, come on!

757
01:21:01,946 --> 01:21:04,152
Murderer!

758
01:21:14,247 --> 01:21:16,619
Jeez!

759
01:21:22,212 --> 01:21:26,044
- Joe! Get out!
- Keep driving!

760
01:21:30,052 --> 01:21:32,674
Jill! Are you okay?

761
01:21:32,805 --> 01:21:38,012
What did I do? Those are the guys who killed
my mother. We gotta go! Joe's in trouble!

762
01:21:39,477 --> 01:21:41,517
Whoa!

763
01:21:59,052 --> 01:22:01,887
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way! Come on. Let's go!

764
01:22:04,307 --> 01:22:07,177
Come on, move it!
Move it!

765
01:22:19,820 --> 01:22:22,738
- Whoa! Look!
- Can you see it?

766
01:22:35,668 --> 01:22:38,538
What? Come on.
Nobody's seen an accident? What?

767
01:22:55,046 --> 01:22:56,706
Oh, my God.

768
01:23:02,303 --> 01:23:06,252
- Phat!
- Come on. Come on!

769
01:23:07,724 --> 01:23:09,717
Will you just go!

770
01:23:33,414 --> 01:23:35,121
- Come on.
- Wait.

771
01:23:35,249 --> 01:23:37,241
The police will be here
any second.

772
01:23:37,375 --> 01:23:39,949
We have to get away from here.
Come on.

773
01:23:44,173 --> 01:23:46,296
Ape! Oh, my God!

774
01:23:49,178 --> 01:23:51,751
Oh, my God.
Let's get out of here!

775
01:23:54,557 --> 01:23:56,882
Move it! Move it!

776
01:24:09,112 --> 01:24:11,069
Far out!

777
01:24:12,782 --> 01:24:14,490
All right!

778
01:24:27,336 --> 01:24:29,625
Turn it off!

779
01:24:43,267 --> 01:24:46,184
- Go, Lisa, go!
- Hurry!

780
01:24:46,311 --> 01:24:49,063
Go! Go, Lisa, go!

781
01:24:49,189 --> 01:24:51,146
Oh, my God!

782
01:24:54,527 --> 01:24:57,100
Oh, my God.

783
01:24:57,238 --> 01:24:59,729
- Oh, my God.
- Shut up! Shut up!

784
01:24:59,865 --> 01:25:01,988
- What are you laughing at?
- That was so cool!

785
01:25:02,117 --> 01:25:05,616
- So cool? He almost squashed us!
- That was not funny at all!

786
01:25:28,557 --> 01:25:30,466
- Yeah!
- Go, Joe! Yeah!

787
01:25:48,074 --> 01:25:49,734
All right! Go, Joe!

788
01:26:03,564 --> 01:26:08,522
- Oh, no. He's not here.
- Couldn't have gotten far.

789
01:26:08,652 --> 01:26:12,898
- Come on, girls. Come on. This way.
- Let's go.

790
01:26:16,437 --> 01:26:19,687
Copy that. Our orders are shoot to kill.
He's extremely dangerous.

791
01:26:19,815 --> 01:26:22,934
- Shoot to kill? He's not dangerous.
You're dangerous! What are you doing with a gun?
- What?

792
01:26:23,068 --> 01:26:25,523
- It's okay, Officer. It's okay. She
didn't mean it. - Calm down. - I meant it!

793
01:26:25,654 --> 01:26:29,318
- Come on. - They're going to shoot
him. - Not if we find him first.

794
01:26:29,449 --> 01:26:32,734
What's that?

795
01:26:32,868 --> 01:26:36,153
- That's it. Come on. We'll follow
that helicopter. - What? - Come on!

796
01:27:03,604 --> 01:27:08,099
I don't wanna hear it. What do you mean? I'm already
20 minutes late. Come on. Who's gonna pay for this?

797
01:27:09,275 --> 01:27:12,561
What are you doing?
We can't go after the gorilla now.

798
01:27:13,696 --> 01:27:18,488
- We need a car.
- What is your supervisor's name, huh?

799
01:27:18,617 --> 01:27:22,946
- Would you please step out of the vehicle.
- What's the problem?

800
01:27:23,079 --> 01:27:28,500
It's the fifth time this year. Hey.
Hey! Hey! Hey, I'm goin'! I'm goin'!

801
01:27:28,626 --> 01:27:30,618
You don't have to be
so pushy about it!

802
01:27:30,753 --> 01:27:33,160
Hello? County Animal Control?

803
01:27:33,297 --> 01:27:35,966
- You're not gonna believe this.
- Honey, look at the birdbath.

804
01:27:36,091 --> 01:27:39,008
- Yes! Yes, it was. It was a gorilla, a big one!
- Oh, my goodness!

805
01:27:39,135 --> 01:27:42,005
- Did you guys see it?
- Andy, come on, sweetheart.

806
01:27:42,138 --> 01:27:45,008
Andy. No, no.
It's a gorilla, honey.

807
01:28:12,969 --> 01:28:16,385
SWAT One, SWAT One, this is Police 2-4.
We've found him.

808
01:28:39,660 --> 01:28:43,028
Yeah, Police 2-4,
SWAT One's on the scene.

809
01:28:44,789 --> 01:28:47,706
He's goin' in the brush.
Don't lose him.

810
01:30:04,917 --> 01:30:07,206
Where'd he go?

811
01:30:10,214 --> 01:30:13,131
- He must have gone under that overpass.
- Well, cut him off.

812
01:30:18,554 --> 01:30:20,879
Bring 'er down.

813
01:30:34,402 --> 01:30:37,521
Must've gone up
that access ramp.

814
01:30:37,655 --> 01:30:39,943
Let's go find 'im.
Let's go.

815
01:31:21,860 --> 01:31:24,102
Where's he headed?

816
01:31:25,489 --> 01:31:28,110
Look. He thinks
it's my flashlight.

817
01:31:28,241 --> 01:31:32,108
He's going towards the light.
He thinks I'm calling him. That's it!

818
01:32:02,855 --> 01:32:04,812
- Daddy!
- Hi, Mommy!

819
01:32:04,940 --> 01:32:08,225
- Mom, I don't think you should go on this ride.
- Why?

820
01:32:08,360 --> 01:32:12,653
- Because you threw up last time. Remember?
- Yeah, but what if I promise to throw up over the side?

821
01:32:12,780 --> 01:32:17,074
- I should go on this by myself.
- Okay. I'll get us some cotton candy.

822
01:32:17,201 --> 01:32:20,237
- Okay.
- And no rocking, Jason!

823
01:32:20,370 --> 01:32:22,410
- Okay.
- Have a good time.

824
01:32:26,543 --> 01:32:29,212
All you gotta do is
hit the pig on the bottom!

825
01:32:29,337 --> 01:32:32,006
That's all you gotta do!

826
01:32:40,346 --> 01:32:42,303
Look!

827
01:32:59,572 --> 01:33:03,355
Oh, my... Honey, come on. Come on
with Mommy. Give Mommy your hand.

828
01:33:03,492 --> 01:33:05,899
- No, Mommy. No, Mommy, let's stay!
- No, no! No, honey!

829
01:33:06,036 --> 01:33:08,361
Please!

830
01:33:35,812 --> 01:33:37,603
Come on. Let's stop it!

831
01:33:37,731 --> 01:33:40,565
Come on, kids, outta there.
There's a wild animal loose.

832
01:33:40,691 --> 01:33:43,526
- Come on. Find your parents. Go! Go! Go!
- Whoa!

833
01:33:43,652 --> 01:33:45,894
See that thing?

834
01:33:53,536 --> 01:33:55,493
Holy...

835
01:34:07,423 --> 01:34:10,543
Come on.

836
01:34:12,761 --> 01:34:16,711
- There she is.
- Just what exactly are you aiming at?

837
01:34:19,851 --> 01:34:21,808
No! You can't do that.

838
01:34:21,936 --> 01:34:25,720
If that girl starts telling people
who we really are...

839
01:34:25,856 --> 01:34:29,605
our whole cover operation
will be blown.

840
01:34:29,735 --> 01:34:33,317
- She's not an animal. She's a human being.
- Joe!

841
01:34:35,240 --> 01:34:37,031
Let's go this way.

842
01:34:44,915 --> 01:34:47,240
- That was very stupid, Garth.
- What was that?

843
01:34:47,375 --> 01:34:50,293
I don't know. Come on.

844
01:34:53,506 --> 01:34:55,297
Fire!

845
01:34:55,424 --> 01:34:57,796
- Go on! Find Joe!
- Joe!

846
01:35:13,634 --> 01:35:17,418
The fire's spreadin' pretty fast. Keep this
wheel moving. We'll get 'em out on the run.

847
01:35:17,554 --> 01:35:20,555
Come on, you guys.
All right. That's it.

848
01:35:22,851 --> 01:35:27,144
- Okay, come on.
- Oh, my God.

849
01:35:30,107 --> 01:35:33,772
- Keep running! Hurry!
- Move it!

850
01:35:42,660 --> 01:35:46,159
Mommy!

851
01:35:48,540 --> 01:35:51,541
Okay, we got everybody off!
Thanks!

852
01:36:10,799 --> 01:36:15,176
Jason! Jason!

853
01:36:49,542 --> 01:36:52,412
Joe!

854
01:36:57,468 --> 01:36:59,425
Goodbye, Jill.

855
01:36:59,553 --> 01:37:02,886
Meet your mother in hell.

856
01:37:03,014 --> 01:37:04,722
Goodbye.

857
01:37:42,708 --> 01:37:45,578
Bring the marksmen up here now!

858
01:38:20,950 --> 01:38:23,737
- We need paramedics. Over.
- Move!

859
01:38:23,869 --> 01:38:28,032
- Jill
- Strasser was here. Joe just killed him
We gotta get out of here now.

860
01:38:29,499 --> 01:38:33,247
- It's too late.
- No. We gotta stop 'em. Come on!

861
01:38:33,377 --> 01:38:35,999
Mom! Mom!

862
01:38:36,130 --> 01:38:40,127
- Evacuate the area! Get out of the way! - No,
you don't understand! - Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

863
01:38:40,259 --> 01:38:43,876
- He's not dangerous!
- Get out of here now!

864
01:38:45,471 --> 01:38:47,131
Mom!

865
01:38:49,266 --> 01:38:52,433
Mommy, help me.

866
01:39:13,663 --> 01:39:15,620
Joe?

867
01:39:18,876 --> 01:39:21,367
- Joe!
- Fire upon my command!

868
01:39:26,049 --> 01:39:27,709
Ready!

869
01:39:27,842 --> 01:39:30,511
Officer, I can't find my son...

870
01:39:30,636 --> 01:39:34,135
and I never saw him
get off the Ferris wheel.

871
01:39:34,265 --> 01:39:38,013
- Look!
- Oh, my God!

872
01:39:39,644 --> 01:39:42,218
- Jason!
- Mommy.

873
01:39:43,481 --> 01:39:45,806
Mommy!

874
01:39:52,698 --> 01:39:56,280
He's gonna try and save him.
Don't shoot!

875
01:40:04,249 --> 01:40:06,871
Hold your fire!

876
01:40:21,515 --> 01:40:23,887
Come on, Joe.

877
01:40:25,727 --> 01:40:28,182
Get the trucks in place.

878
01:40:39,114 --> 01:40:42,233
Help, please!

879
01:40:42,367 --> 01:40:44,857
It's gonna be okay.

880
01:40:48,288 --> 01:40:50,993
- Mom.
- Hang on.

881
01:41:07,055 --> 01:41:09,676
He's got him.

882
01:41:12,185 --> 01:41:14,177
Oh, no! Jason!

883
01:41:23,069 --> 01:41:25,642
Come on, Joe.

884
01:41:27,823 --> 01:41:30,907
Oh, my God, it's gonna tip!
It's gonna tilt!

885
01:41:31,035 --> 01:41:32,992
- Everybody get back! Run!
- Joe!

886
01:41:33,120 --> 01:41:36,073
- No! No!
- Joe!

887
01:41:54,555 --> 01:41:56,762
No!

888
01:42:28,217 --> 01:42:32,001
- Oh, please! Oh, baby!
- He's okay.

889
01:42:32,138 --> 01:42:34,426
- Joe! Open your eyes.
- Easy does it.

890
01:42:34,556 --> 01:42:36,679
- Easy does it. - Come on,
big guy. - Easy does it.

891
01:42:36,808 --> 01:42:38,801
- Come on. - Mommy!
- Oh, yeah, honey.

892
01:42:38,935 --> 01:42:41,307
- Ohh. I'm here.
- Come on, big guy.

893
01:42:41,437 --> 01:42:45,020
- Open your eyes.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

894
01:42:45,149 --> 01:42:47,438
Come on, Joe!

895
01:42:47,568 --> 01:42:51,731
Joe? No. No. No.

896
01:42:51,863 --> 01:42:55,611
- Mommy, is he gonna be okay?
- I don't know, honey.

897
01:42:55,742 --> 01:42:59,027
No. No! Joe!

898
01:43:01,921 --> 01:43:04,542
Keep these people back!

899
01:43:06,133 --> 01:43:08,126
Back it up!

900
01:43:08,260 --> 01:43:12,720
No. No!

901
01:43:20,896 --> 01:43:23,138
Don't leave me, big guy.

902
01:44:18,030 --> 01:44:20,402
Joe?

903
01:44:25,412 --> 01:44:27,985
Joe?

904
01:44:28,122 --> 01:44:31,040
- He's alive!
- He's alive?

905
01:44:31,167 --> 01:44:33,455
- Joe!
- He's alive!

906
01:44:36,588 --> 01:44:38,664
- Joe.
- He's alive!

907
01:44:38,799 --> 01:44:42,926
You big palooka.
That's no way to ride a Ferris wheel.

908
01:44:43,052 --> 01:44:45,424
Joe! Big guy, you scared me.

909
01:44:45,555 --> 01:44:48,757
We gotta get him outta here,
get him somewhere safe.

910
01:44:51,351 --> 01:44:54,637
Somewhere safe?

911
01:44:54,771 --> 01:44:57,855
Somewhere safe
means a new home for Joe.

912
01:44:57,982 --> 01:45:00,651
Where are we gonna get
that kind of money?

913
01:45:00,776 --> 01:45:03,445
I've got some money for Joe.

914
01:45:16,332 --> 01:45:18,573
Here. For Joe.

915
01:45:18,709 --> 01:45:22,327
- Come on, folks. Let's help him out.
- Thank you. Thank you.

916
01:45:24,547 --> 01:45:27,252
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

917
01:45:32,513 --> 01:45:35,763
Dear Cecily, I promised to write you
when Joe was settled...

918
01:45:35,891 --> 01:45:38,464
and now I finally can.

919
01:45:38,601 --> 01:45:41,472
With all the contributions
people sent in for Joe...

920
01:45:41,604 --> 01:45:46,312
we were able to buy a beautiful land
preserve that's even big enough for him.

921
01:45:51,988 --> 01:45:55,571
We dedicated the Joe Young
Wildlife Park today...

922
01:45:55,700 --> 01:45:59,069
and it was one of
the happiest days of my life.

923
01:46:04,416 --> 01:46:08,579
At last, I have kept my promise
to my mother.

924
01:46:11,839 --> 01:46:15,255
The people here are saying N'Gai Zamu,
the sacred guardian...

925
01:46:15,384 --> 01:46:18,385
has returned
to protect the mountains.

926
01:46:18,512 --> 01:46:22,889
Other people still say
N'Gai Zamu is just a legend.

927
01:46:23,016 --> 01:46:26,266
I say legends live forever.
