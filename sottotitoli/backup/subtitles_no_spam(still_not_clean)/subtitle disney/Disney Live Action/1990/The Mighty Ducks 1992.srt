00:00:03,146 --> 00:00:18,818

1
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,573
- Bring it in, Gordon.
- Okay, Dad.

2
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:15,743
All right! Way to shoot, there.
You look good, son.

3
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:17,078
Thanks.

4
00:01:17,787 --> 00:01:20,372
Listen, I want you
to remember this pond.

5
00:01:20,915 --> 00:01:23,959
No matter how far you go,
don't forget your home.

6
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:42,853
<i>Here in the third
period, where the Minnehaha Waves</i>

7
00:01:42,937 --> 00:01:46,065
<i>led by Gordon Bombay
are in the lead four to one.</i>

8
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:47,858
<i>What a story this is!</i>

9
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:51,487
<i>He went from a legal career to coach
the Minneapolis Mighty Ducks</i>

10
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,031
<i>to a State Pee Wee
Championship last year.</i>

11
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:56,450
<i>And this year, at age 29,</i>

12
00:01:56,534 --> 00:01:59,745
<i>he's one short step away
from the N.H.L.</i>

13
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:03,582
<i>There's the puck at center ice.
It's intercepted by Gordon Bombay.</i>

14
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:07,211
<i>Bombay across the blue line. He's in
all alone. Great chance for Bombay.</i>

15
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:10,089
<i>Dekes once, twice, in front.
He shoots. He scores!</i>

16
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:11,465
Yeah!

17
00:02:11,549 --> 00:02:16,303
<i>Gordon Bombay, unassisted,
puts his team up five to one.</i>

18
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:18,722
<i>Boy, he can still fly.</i>

19
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:20,975
<i>If he keeps this up,
I'd expect to see him</i>

20
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:23,519
<i>in the National Hockey League
real soon.</i>

21
00:02:39,243 --> 00:02:40,703
<i>Here's Bombay in his own zone.</i>

22
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:43,414
<i>Comes up the right wing side,
steps away from one check there.</i>

23
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:46,458
<i>Still has the puck at center ice.
Gets pinned along the boards.</i>

24
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:47,835
<i>Fights to get free.</i>

25
00:02:56,677 --> 00:03:00,347
<i>Oh, what a hit!
Bombay goes down hard.</i>

26
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:57,047
Hello, Jan!

27
00:04:57,464 --> 00:05:00,467
Welcome back, Gordon.
Get in! Get in!

28
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,428
Thanks for comin' down to get me.

29
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,434
Great to see ya.

30
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:10,686
Hans couldn't make it?

31
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:13,355
Ah, don't get me started
on that strudel-head.

32
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:15,858
He went back to the old country
for the summer.

33
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:18,360
Left me to run
the shop all by myself.

34
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,321
Wanted to visit our mama.

35
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,531
She loves him more, you know.

36
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:41,383
- Sorry, did I wake you?
- Hey, Charlie.

37
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,262
- Hey, Coach. It's good to see you.
- Good to see you.

38
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:47,222
We really missed you.

39
00:05:48,474 --> 00:05:51,060
For breakfast, my specialty:
Jan's hasen--

40
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:53,520
- Hasenpfeffer and eggs.
- Yeah.

41
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:55,814
I thought I smelled something burning.

42
00:05:55,898 --> 00:05:57,900
I see you've met my new apprentice.

43
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:00,861
Jan told me you did this job
when you were my age.

44
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:03,947
- That's right. I hope he pays you more.
- You got paid?

45
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,076
Eat, everybody, before
the hasenpfeffer gets cold.

46
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:22,591
That was a good day.

47
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,135
Look at Charlie. God, he's grown.

48
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,720
Oh. They do that.

49
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:31,058
Since his mother remarried,
he started spending a lot of time here.

50
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,185
I just had to hire him.

51
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:36,688
I should've kept in touch more.
But you are here now.

52
00:06:36,772 --> 00:06:38,065
So what's your plan?

53
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:39,942
Have you talked to Ducksworth?

54
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:44,113
No, no. I'm not a lawyer,
Jan, I'm a player.

55
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:47,658
But your injury,
it requires rest and time.

56
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:50,494
Yeah, time is something
I don't have a whole lot of.

57
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:52,913
I was this close to the N.H.L., Jan.

58
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:54,915
I was back in the game.

59
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:57,418
And, man, I was alive.

60
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,630
Have you thought about coaching?

61
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,050
After all, you were
the Minnesota Miracle Man.

62
00:07:05,134 --> 00:07:08,262
Well, coaching the Ducks was one
of the best things in my life

63
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:10,764
but I can't make a living
coaching Pee Wee hockey.

64
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:12,975
Where there's a way,
there must be a will.

65
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:16,520
My hockey suppliers tell me
Team U.S.A. is still without a coach

66
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,689
for the Junior Goodwill Games.

67
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:22,860
Sounds great. Give 'em a call for me, Jan.
Maybe I can sharpen their skates.

68
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:24,653
Don't knock skate sharpening.

69
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:29,074
I know. It's a great skill, Jan. But
I don't want to spend the rest of my life

70
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,453
sharpening skates in this rinky-dink town.
I want something better.

71
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,205
Something bigger.

72
00:07:41,462 --> 00:07:42,629
Whoa!

73
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:52,514
- You don't have to do them right now.
- Oh, thanks.

74
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:56,101
You have a customer. Go and help him.
Then come back and do them.

75
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:04,818
- Can I help you?
- Oh!

76
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:08,071
Oops, sorry.
Got away from me. Hi.

77
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:11,575
Oh, wow, yeah.
You look great. Yeah.

78
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:14,286
- Yeah, much better than your pictures.
- Thanks.

79
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,706
I'm, uh, Don Tibbles, Senior V.P.,
Hendrix Hockey Apparel.

80
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:20,209
How's the knee?
I have a doctor in Los Angeles

81
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:24,213
I want to take a look at it. He's doing
great things with baboon ligaments.

82
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:25,714
Hendrix Hockey, huh?

83
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:28,884
What exactly is it that
you want, Mr. Tibbles?

84
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:30,302
I want you, Gordon.

85
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:34,264
I want the next coach of Team U.S.A.
to become a household name.

86
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:36,558
I want you to become
synonymous with winning

87
00:08:36,642 --> 00:08:38,769
and winning to become
synonymous with Hendrix.

88
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:42,272
Er, wait a minute.
You're joking, right? I mean...

89
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:45,192
- This is a joke.
- It's no joke.

90
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:46,860
This is the real thing, Gordon.

91
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:50,614
You want me to coach
Team U.S.A.?

92
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,116
Your friend Jan's been
pitching you for months.

93
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,411
Gordon, what you did with the Ducks,
there was magic, and we--

94
00:08:56,495 --> 00:08:58,413
And by we, I mean Hendrix Hockey,

95
00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:02,459
the Junior Goodwill Games
and your country-- need that magic.

96
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:06,213
What do ya say, coach?

97
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:11,218
Come on.
Let's round up those Ducks.

98
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:13,303
- Got a lot of work to do.
- Gordon.

99
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:15,514
Use this.

100
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:20,352
- Thanks, Jan.
- Go get 'em, Gordon.

101
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,244
<i>Hey, Charlie!</i>

102
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:41,999
Hey! You wanna play some hockey?

103
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,017
Watch me go!
This is your last chance!

104
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,185
Come on, man! Move it!

105
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,063
Yes! Yeah!

106
00:10:05,147 --> 00:10:07,733
Hey, Charlie!

107
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:09,234
Jesse, we're back!

108
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:11,194
Let's go get Averman.

109
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:16,450
- Look out!
- You can't--

110
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:18,452
What are you kids doin' over there!

111
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:20,370
- Whoa, hey!
- Cool, man!

112
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:25,042
- Let's go, Jesse. Over to the left.
- Yeah!

113
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,085
Whoa!

114
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:33,091
- Averman, let's go!
- Come on! Come on!

115
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:35,719
- But, but, but--
- Come on, let's go!

116
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:01,078
- Where we goin' now?
- Gotta get Connie and Guy.

117
00:11:08,627 --> 00:11:12,172
The Quack Attack is back, Jack!

118
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,633
- Come on, let's go!
- Come on!

119
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:16,635
I was this close.

120
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:21,098
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

121
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:26,645
Whoa!

122
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:29,523
Yeah!

123
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:33,235
Oh!

124
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,036
Oh, look.

125
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,123
Goldberg!

126
00:11:50,252 --> 00:11:51,420
Come on, Goldberg!

127
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,968
- All right!
- All right!

128
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,137
All right, yeah!

129
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:04,015
- Whoa!
- Yeah!

130
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:13,191
He's comin' across the goalie,
between his legs-Score!

131
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:14,693
Hey, cake-eater!

132
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:16,361
You wanna play some real hockey?

133
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:18,238
- Yeah, come on!
- Yeah!

134
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:24,119
Guys, it's an
international competition.

135
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:27,664
- It's us against the world.
- Hey, man, bring 'em on. We're ready!

136
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:30,751
- Oh, Goldberg!
- Whoa!

137
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:34,838
Hi.

138
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:38,967
Ducks!

139
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,637
I still can't believe
they beat us last year.

140
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:44,639
Well, let's do somethin' about it.

141
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:46,641
Yeah! All right!

142
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:55,275
- Come on! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
- Hurry up!

143
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:59,821
- Tighter! Tighter! Tighter! Tighter!
- Come on! Get over here.

144
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,158
- Come on. Over here. Over here.
- Shh.

145
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:05,911
They're sittin' ducks.

146
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:08,663
- Here they come.
- I love this.

147
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:10,791
They are so stupid.

148
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:14,461
One large order of
shredded duck comin' up.

149
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:17,047
- They won't know what hit 'em.
- I know.

150
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:22,469
Who said that?

151
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:24,930
Hi, guys.

152
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:29,518
Hey, come here!

153
00:13:30,602 --> 00:13:33,271
Hey, get over here, huh?
Come here!

154
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:36,483
See you later, buddy! Come here!

155
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,820
Yeah!

156
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:42,280
Come on, let us go!

157
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:44,324
My mom's pickin' me up!

158
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,411
That'll teach ya to mess
with the Ducks! Yeah!

159
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:55,752
Ducks! Ducks!

160
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:03,718
Ducks! Ducks! Ducks!
Ducks! Ducks! Ducks!

161
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:06,388
Ducks! Ducks! Ducks!
Ducks! Ducks! Ducks!

162
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:09,140
Hey!

163
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:11,643
Okay! All right!
Come on, get back!

164
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:15,480
Ducks! Ducks! Ducks! Ducks!
Ducks! Ducks! Ducks! Ducks!

165
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:17,899
Welcome back, Ducks.
I really missed you guys.

166
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:19,234
Are you ready to fly?

167
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:21,278
Yeah!

168
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,697
All right! All right!

169
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,408
Awesome! Wow!
Who's in there?

170
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:28,577
Can't be from this neighborhood.

171
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:31,538
Hey, guys! I'm Don Tibbles,
Hendrix Hockey Apparel.

172
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:34,165
We're your official sponsors.
Anybody want a card?

173
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:36,960
Yeah, yeah! Absolutely!
I'll take one!

174
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,545
Hey.

175
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:43,508
Nice wheels. I used to ride
around in one of these.

176
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:45,594
Well, I got something to show you.

177
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:48,513
This is your endorsement
contract with Hendrix.

178
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:51,766
I been tryin' to figure this out.
What does Hendrix want with me?

179
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:55,145
- I-- I'm just a coach.
- Pat Riley, Bear Bryant...

180
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,480
Mike Ditka, are they just coaches?

181
00:14:57,772 --> 00:15:00,901
Gordon, today coaches have images.
Images mean dollars.

182
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:04,571
I sell you, you sell the sport.
We both get rich. How's that sound?

183
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:07,657
Don't get me wrong. I don't have
anything against making money.

184
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:08,867
No, Gordon.

185
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:11,995
A lot of money.

186
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,915
You're gonna pay me that much
to endorse sportswear?

187
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:17,918
Gordon, life can be great
when you know the right people.

188
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:20,128
What do you say?

189
00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:22,088
- Got a pen?
- Oh, yeah.

190
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:24,716
<i>Former Pee Wee coach</i>

191
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:28,261
<i>and minor league player, Gordon Bombay
makes the move to the national stage</i>

192
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:30,722
<i>as he steps behind
the bench for Team U.S.A.</i>

193
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:34,267
<i>Coach Bombay's Ducks will be joined
by some of the top young players...</i>

194
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:36,144
<i>from around the United States.</i>

195
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:40,148
- Tell me about my new kids.
- That's Luis Mendoza.

196
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:43,818
He's from our Miami club.
A real speedster. Incredible skater.

197
00:15:43,902 --> 00:15:46,947
I clocked him at 1.9 seconds,
blue line to blue line.

198
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:57,999
- Good-looking skater.
- Very good-looking.

199
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,293
- What do you think, Guy?
- Shut up, Averman.

200
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:03,505
He has one minor problem.

201
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:09,052
- Has a little trouble stopping.
- I'd say so.

202
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:11,596
- Are you okay?
- Need some help?

203
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,516
Yeah. I'm all right.
I almost had it that time.

204
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:19,854
Yee-haw! How is everyone!

205
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:21,690
Y'all ready to play some puck?

206
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:24,734
Hey, look. It's Hopalong Gretzky.

207
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:27,195
That's Dwayne Robertson from Austin.

208
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,698
He's the best puck handler
I've ever seen.

209
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:32,242
- You mean for his age.
- No, I don't.

210
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:36,663
Hey, this is easier than
ropin' hogs! Yee-haw!

211
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,499
He does have
a tendency to showboat.

212
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:41,751
- Yahoo!
- Wow.

213
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:43,753
There's Julie "The Cat" Gaffney.

214
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:46,798
She won the state championship
for Maine three years in a row.

215
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:48,508
Well, we have a goalie. Goldberg.

216
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:52,512
All right! Bring 'em on, man! I'm ready
for this! I'm the man! I'm the man!

217
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:57,058
Uh, help.

218
00:16:57,142 --> 00:16:58,309
Watch this.

219
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:07,318
Well, we...
could use a backup.

220
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:11,114
Isn't that the kid
from the Olympics? The figure skater?

221
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:13,533
Yup. Ken Wu. What can I say?

222
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:16,202
I convinced him that hockey
had more of a future.

223
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:19,289
We put a stick in his hands
and nobody's been able to touch him.

224
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,254
- Yeah. Show time!
- That guy's a teenager?

225
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,631
<i>Don't you know that</i>

226
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:32,343
<i>Everything's on fire, yeah</i>

227
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:35,430
- Uh, yeah. Hormones.
- He's a goon.

228
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:39,017
C'mon, Tex! Sing it with me!

229
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,310
Uh-uh! No!

230
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:42,062
<i>Everything</i>

231
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:45,440
- Here ya go, sweetie!
- My kids don't play that kinda hockey.

232
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:47,442
I believe they're called
enforcers, Gordon.

233
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:49,235
When you play Iceland,
you're gonna need him.

234
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:51,780
My little man!

235
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:53,239
Who does this guy think he is?

236
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:55,867
- All right, that's it!
- Let me take care of this.

237
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:07,253
Everybody freeze!

238
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:11,049
Now, we didn't
come here to fight!

239
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:13,051
We came here to play hockey!

240
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:16,513
We're Team U.S.A.
You represent your country.

241
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:19,140
- That's right.
- Now, I want you--

242
00:18:19,224 --> 00:18:23,061
To be all that you can be, right?
Ya gotta raise yourself up, guys! Ya got--

243
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:25,730
All right, now.

244
00:18:25,814 --> 00:18:28,191
- Let's start with the scrimmage.
- Great! Scrimmage!

245
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:30,360
You heard your coach! Now--

246
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,612
Hey. You don't need me here.

247
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:35,573
I've got an appointment anyway.
I've got to see Miss MacKay.

248
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:37,867
- She's the team tutor.
- Don?

249
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:42,038
Come on.

250
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,875
You'll get it back
at the end of the school term.

251
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:47,919
All right, Ducks.

252
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:50,130
Show 'em what you got!
Let's scrimmage!

253
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:56,636
- Great day for hockey, ain't it?
- Sure is, cowboy.

254
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:00,348
Yee-haw!

255
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:07,021
- Hey, man, take it easy! Slow down!
- Goldberg, look out!

256
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:10,483
Oh, no!

257
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:12,944
This guy's gotta learn how to stop.

258
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:15,613
- Thanks for breaking my fall.
- Anytime.

259
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:20,368
- Let's go, defense!
- Whoa!

260
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:26,666
Come on!
Dig it out of there!

261
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:28,877
Let's go! Come on!

262
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,254
Haven't you guys been training
in the off-season?

263
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:33,173
You know, I knew we forgot somethin'.

264
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:40,471
Good shot, Adam.
Way to show 'em!

265
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:45,351
How do you feel, tough guy?

266
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:49,272
Ding! Round one.

267
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:53,902
Wait 'til you meet these kids.
They're just fantastic.

268
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:58,573
- Look out!
- It's Fulton! Look out for his shot!

269
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:00,825
What a bunch of wusses!

270
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:03,286
Oh!

271
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:10,043
Half of 'em are ringers from various
parts of the U.S. Then the other half--

272
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:12,045
- Duck!
- That's right. The Ducks.

273
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:15,465
Hello? Mr. Tibbles?

274
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:18,885
Mr.. Tibbles? Mr. Tibbles,
can you hear me?

275
00:20:19,302 --> 00:20:21,137
Mr. Tibbles, wake up.

276
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:25,016
Oh, Mr. Tibbles,
are you all right?

277
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:29,312
Oh uh, I'll have the cheeseburger,
fries, and a chocolate shake, please.

278
00:20:31,606 --> 00:20:34,734
I think he'll be okay.
We'll keep an eye on him.

279
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:37,737
Oh, I'm sorry.
He didn't have a chance to introduce us.

280
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:40,365
I'm Michele MacKay, their tutor.

281
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:43,826
- Hi, I'm Coach Bombay, their coach.
- Who said we need a tutor?

282
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,079
- Yeah. Really.
- I don't need no school.

283
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:48,998
Now, Miss MacKay,
we're America's team here.

284
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:53,294
Shouldn't we just be concentrating on
hockey? May I suggest optional attendance?

285
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:55,964
- I agree.
- Yeah. Good idea.

286
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:58,883
- Well, that's not a bad idea.
- Call me Goldberg.

287
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:02,345
Goldberg. Yes. School will be optional.

288
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:05,056
However--

289
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:09,602
However, should you not attend,
you will not be eligible to play.

290
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:13,147
Oh, that's unfair!
Man, can she do that?

291
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:16,651
Hey, is that a tattoo?
Is it real?

292
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,945
- Get away from me.
- Yes, sir.

293
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,866
Well, I'm just here to tutor the kids

294
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:26,327
and provide them
with a little adult supervision.

295
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:34,335
Oh, my gosh!
Oh!

296
00:21:34,836 --> 00:21:37,922
- That was awesome. Are you okay?
- Yes.

297
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:40,049
All right!

298
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:44,887
- Sorry.
- Yeah, sorry.

299
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:46,973
We're okay.

300
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:52,812
This is more crowded
than a truckload of goats.

301
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:55,356
Somebody better watch their hands.

302
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:57,317
Yeah, someone licked me!

303
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:01,112
- Oh, I smell somethin'.
- Ew!

304
00:22:01,863 --> 00:22:03,614
Goldberg!

305
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:06,659
- It wasn't me.
- No, it was me!

306
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:08,953
Thank you.

307
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:11,789
I don't know how to make
this any clearer.

308
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,750
You are a team.

309
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:17,670
And to win this thing,
you have to work as one.

310
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:21,090
Now as one, skate.

311
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:24,052
Whoa!

312
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:28,973
Everyone goes their own way, everyone
falls down. Now get up and try it again.

313
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:31,851
All right, all of you
move to your right. Now.

314
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:33,895
- Who made you boss?
- Everyone to the left.

315
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:35,313
Yeah, left guys. Come on.

316
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:39,859
- Aw, man.
- You guys can argue all you want

317
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:42,612
but I am not untying you
until you move as one.

318
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:47,784
Now you're learning!
Communication! That's it!

319
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:50,036
Good, together.
Move together.

320
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:52,038
Charge! All right!

321
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:54,040
- Right turn!
- Turn right.

322
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:57,710
Yeah, that's it! That's it!
All right! Knock wood, Charlie.

323
00:22:58,044 --> 00:23:01,756
You guys are startin' to look like
hockey players. I'm proud of ya, team.

324
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:03,383
You worked hard today.

325
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,469
But hockey should also be fun.

326
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,097
- Rancher Dwayne.
- Yes, sir!

327
00:23:09,263 --> 00:23:12,517
- Round me up some stray cattle there.
- Uh-oh.

328
00:23:12,642 --> 00:23:15,812
- My pleasure!
- Whoa!

329
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:12,702
Ta-da!
- Oh! That's awesome!

330
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:17,874
- Hey, y'all. That's us!
- Duh, whatta ya know?

331
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:21,252
Today, it's a Wheaties box.

332
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:24,505
Tomorrow, it's video games,
action figures, lunch boxes.

333
00:24:24,589 --> 00:24:25,965
The sky is the limit.

334
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:28,926
Now, just to make sure that
everybody knows who you are,

335
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:31,846
try on one of these.

336
00:24:32,263 --> 00:24:34,056
Oh, that's so cool!

337
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:37,810
Brought to you by those wonderful people
at Hendrix for all your hockey needs.

338
00:24:37,935 --> 00:24:39,770
Fulton, there you go. Coach.

339
00:24:39,854 --> 00:24:43,024
Everybody take your own. I'm not
gonna give 'em out to everybody.

340
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,404
That's nice, Coach, but we're Ducks.

341
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:50,364
This stuff says "Hendrix" all over it.

342
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:52,617
Well, yeah, they're our sponsors, Charlie.

343
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,577
So what?
Can't we be U.S.A. Ducks?

344
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:57,205
Or at least keep our own colors?

345
00:24:57,288 --> 00:24:59,749
It's business stuff, Charlie.
Don't worry about it.

346
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:04,170
- What'd ya think?
- I love it. It's cool.

347
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:11,010
Ancient Greece was the beginning
of Western Civilization.

348
00:25:11,344 --> 00:25:16,182
See, in Greece, they didn't have
professional sports or <i>Wheaties</i> boxes.

349
00:25:16,474 --> 00:25:19,143
So the athletes competed
for another reason.

350
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,604
- Anybody?
- Falafels?

351
00:25:21,896 --> 00:25:24,607
- Oh. Greg.
- You wish, Goldberg.

352
00:25:25,316 --> 00:25:27,652
- Charlie?
- Pride.

353
00:25:27,944 --> 00:25:29,362
That's right.

354
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:33,950
The various city-states waved their flags
and wore their home colors proudly.

355
00:25:34,534 --> 00:25:36,035
Did America always dominate?

356
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:37,828
- Fulton.
- That's a good question.

357
00:25:37,912 --> 00:25:41,707
No. America wasn't around back then.

358
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:43,709
- It's okay.
- Don't forget that compared

359
00:25:43,793 --> 00:25:48,130
to other countries, America is still
young, still forming its own identity.

360
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:51,425
America is a teenager just like you.

361
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:54,262
- Like us?
- You bet.

362
00:25:55,054 --> 00:26:00,601
A little awkward at times but always
right there on the verge of greatness.

363
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:03,521
<i>I don't know but I been told</i>

364
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:05,982
<i>I don't know but I been told</i>

365
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:08,609
<i>Team U.S.A.'s gonna win the gold</i>

366
00:26:08,693 --> 00:26:10,695
<i>U.S.A.'s gonna win the gold</i>

367
00:26:10,778 --> 00:26:13,072
<i>Listen up and listen good</i>

368
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:15,324
<i>Listen up and listen good</i>

369
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:17,285
<i>We're all headed for Hollywood</i>

370
00:26:17,368 --> 00:26:19,829
<i>We're all headed for Hollywood</i>

371
00:26:19,954 --> 00:26:22,164

374
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:38,514
<i>Welcome

375
00:26:38,598 --> 00:26:41,851

00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:44,895
<i>arrive to compete in
both winter and summer events.</i>

377
00:26:45,146 --> 00:26:48,024
<i>The U.S.A. is expected
to score well in the medal count</i>

378
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:51,068
<i>especially in basketball,
swimming and hockey.</i>

379
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:54,947
<i>And there's Team U.S.A. hockey
led by Coach Gordon Bombay.</i>

380
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:58,618
<i>They're looking fit and anxious
to begin the competition.</i>

381
00:27:01,746 --> 00:27:04,707
<i>Tonight's game matches
the second-seeded Team U.S.A</i>

382
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:07,501
<i>against the tenth-seeded team,
Trinidad Tobago.</i>

383
00:27:07,627 --> 00:27:11,589
<i>This marks the first game for Team U.S.A.
in this double-elimination...</i>

384
00:27:11,714 --> 00:27:13,549
<i>winner-take-all tournament.</i>

385
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:16,594
<i>Gordon Bombay looks to have
his team well in control here.</i>

386
00:27:16,677 --> 00:27:18,721
<i>They lead six to nothing.</i>

387
00:27:28,731 --> 00:27:30,650
This is sewn up tight!

388
00:27:30,733 --> 00:27:32,652
- All right!
- Yeah!

389
00:27:32,735 --> 00:27:34,737
Yeah, high-five some more.

390
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,239
Man, my little brother
could score on these guys.

391
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:38,991
Go bother him, then.

392
00:27:39,075 --> 00:27:41,160
I ain't even got a little brother!

393
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:43,829
<i>Hey, Jesse! Quit gabbin'
and get on the ice.</i>

394
00:27:43,913 --> 00:27:45,665
Show me you want it, son. Go!

395
00:27:45,748 --> 00:27:47,750
Yeah, show us
you want it son. Go!

396
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:52,505
'Kay.

397
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:02,223
Oh!

398
00:28:02,348 --> 00:28:04,392
Face-off!

399
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:07,269
Hey, what's your problem, man?

400
00:28:07,353 --> 00:28:09,605
Jesse, forget about it! Let's go!

401
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:13,693
<i>U.S.A. penalty,
number nine, Hall. Two minutes, roughing.</i>

402
00:28:14,485 --> 00:28:16,529
He dissed you bad, G.

403
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:19,490
- Yeah? Come here, man!
- Bye-bye.

404
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:21,200
- Have a nice day.
- Punk!

405
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:32,253
- All right, Fulton, let's have some fun!
- Yeah, Portman, let's do it!

406
00:28:40,428 --> 00:28:42,972
- All right!
- Yeah! Yeah!

407
00:28:43,097 --> 00:28:45,474
- That's it.
- All right, Portman, take it!

408
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:50,563
- Way to go! Hey, hey!
- Yeah!

409
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:53,149
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

410
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:55,401
- Yeah!
- All right!

411
00:28:55,526 --> 00:28:56,861
Yeah!

412
00:28:57,027 --> 00:28:59,113
Look at those guys!
Look at 'em!

413
00:28:59,196 --> 00:29:01,824
They're the Bash Brothers!

414
00:29:03,701 --> 00:29:05,619
Hey, ya got a girl
in the stands?

415
00:29:05,995 --> 00:29:07,538
No. Scouts, man. Look at 'em.

416
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:10,458
Don't worry about scouts, Adam.
Just play your best.

417
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:14,044
<i>Team U.S.A.
loses the puck at center ice.</i>

418
00:29:14,128 --> 00:29:17,173
<i>Here's Bellafonte across the blue line
with a great move.</i>

419
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:20,384
<i>Walks right down in front.
He shoots, he scores!</i>

420
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:23,721
Way to go, man!
Way to go!

421
00:29:31,187 --> 00:29:34,940
<i>Nearing the end of the game,
Team U.S.A. with it out at center ice.</i>

422
00:29:35,024 --> 00:29:38,110
<i>Here's Connie Moreau. Moreau
stick-handling in the Trinidad zone.</i>

423
00:29:38,194 --> 00:29:41,280
<i>Moreau still with it, moves around
a pileup, gives it to Kenny Wu.</i>

424
00:29:41,363 --> 00:29:45,034
<i>Wu, the former figure skater, back behind
the net, ducks underneath the check.</i>

425
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:47,745
<i>Moves around the it.
It's a wraparound. He scores!</i>

426
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:52,458
All right, way to go!
That wasn't a game, that was a statement!

427
00:29:57,713 --> 00:30:00,049
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
Team U.S.A. hockey.</i>

428
00:30:01,175 --> 00:30:04,512
And the man chosen to lead them
to the gold, Gordon Bombay.

429
00:30:04,595 --> 00:30:06,680
Bring the bear up here.

430
00:30:06,764 --> 00:30:09,099
- This is Henry, the Hendrix bear.
- Hello, everyone!

431
00:30:09,183 --> 00:30:12,269
Guys, I want you to come in,
get some shots with the bear.

432
00:30:12,353 --> 00:30:14,980
Big wave! Big wave!
Wave to everybody!

433
00:30:15,064 --> 00:30:18,734
- Hello, everybody! It's great to be here!
- Got that? Great.

434
00:30:18,818 --> 00:30:22,404
Thanks a lot. Okay, we're gonna
open it up to questions. Yes.

435
00:30:22,822 --> 00:30:24,490
Team U.S.A., how does it feel

436
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:27,660
competing on the international level
here in Los Angeles?

437
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:29,870
- Um--
- Feels good. Love it.

438
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:34,166
Coach Bombay, the Vikings
from Iceland are the heavy favorite.

439
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:36,836
Their coach has already
guaranteed victory.

440
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:38,504
How are you gonna handle them?

441
00:30:39,672 --> 00:30:41,549
Um... hard work.

442
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:45,386
I think our team is ready to go up
against the best in the world.

443
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:49,014
We're not worried about 'em.
Iceland may be tough, but, uh...

444
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:51,308
We're Team U.S.A.
and we're goin' all the way.

445
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:54,937
- Yeah! All right, Coach!
- Okay, that's it.

446
00:30:55,062 --> 00:30:57,731
Thank you very much.
Thank you, everybody.

447
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:01,610
- Real good. Did good.
- Team U.S.A.'s going down.

448
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:03,237
That's where you're going.

449
00:31:06,949 --> 00:31:08,492
See you on the ice, Bombay!

450
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:11,871
That's, uh, Stansson.

451
00:31:11,954 --> 00:31:14,415
Coach of the Iceland team.
He's wound a little tight.

452
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:17,835
Stansson from the N.H.L.?
Wolf "The Dentist" Stansson is coaching?

453
00:31:17,918 --> 00:31:20,963
- You didn't tell me that.
- It's all right!

454
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:23,507
- That guy's a dentist?
- That was his nickname.

455
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:26,260
Played one year of pro,
collected more teeth than goals.

456
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:27,803
He even punched out his coach.

457
00:31:27,887 --> 00:31:30,222
They ran him out of
the league and the country.

458
00:31:30,306 --> 00:31:33,559
What happened to freedom
of speech, huh? Isn't this America?

459
00:31:33,976 --> 00:31:36,228
That's his team?
Those guys are huge!

460
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:39,231
- One more thing--
- He's already told you what he thinks.

461
00:31:39,315 --> 00:31:41,275
- Gordon.
- Thanks. How'd I do?

462
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:45,279
- Great. It was quite a circus, huh?
- It's all part of the game.

463
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:48,657
A giant polar bear with sunglasses
is part of hockey now?

464
00:31:49,283 --> 00:31:50,951
I guess the game's really changed.

465
00:31:51,035 --> 00:31:53,037
Gordon, come on.
CNN, one on one.

466
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,831
CNN.

467
00:31:55,915 --> 00:31:59,293
Gordon!
Just one question! One question!

468
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:01,503
Hello there, missy.
How about a bear hug?

469
00:32:04,006 --> 00:32:06,342
Tibbles, what are we
doin' here in Malibu?

470
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:09,553
This is your new place, man.
It's our way of saying "Thank you."

471
00:32:09,637 --> 00:32:12,514
You take care of Hendrix,
Hendrix is gonna take care of you.

472
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:16,018
I can't help feeling a little guilty.
Shouldn't I be closer to the team?

473
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:26,236
Whoa.

474
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:34,703
You know, they don't
need me 24 hours a day.

475
00:32:34,787 --> 00:32:37,456
- I'm sure they're just fine in the dorms.
- Yeah.

476
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:53,555
Shh. Do it quiet.

477
00:32:54,056 --> 00:32:56,183
All right.
Let me get the hand.

478
00:32:57,226 --> 00:32:58,394
- Hurry.
- I'm hurrying!

479
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:01,647
- Shh!
- Go ahead.

480
00:33:06,777 --> 00:33:08,612
Okay, that's good. Feather.

481
00:33:11,532 --> 00:33:12,700
Shh.

482
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:44,356
Ah.

483
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:47,818
- A little tune-age to go to sleep by?
- Yeah.

484
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:48,944
All right.

485
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:51,864
All right.

486
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:00,664
Sweet dreams, dude.

487
00:34:16,263 --> 00:34:17,931
What's goin' on?

488
00:34:18,015 --> 00:34:20,893
Yeah! Whoo!

489
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:23,896
Yeah! Come on! Yeah!

490
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:25,689
It's great to be here.

491
00:34:25,773 --> 00:34:28,525
<i>The guys at Hendrix Hockey
have been absolutely fantastic.</i>

492
00:34:28,609 --> 00:34:32,696
But I got a game against Italy,
so I'll talk to you right after we win it.

493
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:35,657
- Thank you. Thanks, Coach. Good-bye.
- Good luck, Coach.

494
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:39,953
- Get 'em tonight.
- Thank you very much. Thank you.

495
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:42,748
- Oh. I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry. Uh--

496
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:44,750
No, it was my fault.
I was clumsy.

497
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:48,670
- You're Coach Bombay.
- That's right.

498
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:50,839
You play well.

499
00:34:51,298 --> 00:34:54,218
- Well, thank you.
- I mean your team. Your team plays well.

500
00:34:54,343 --> 00:34:55,803
I-- I know what you meant.

501
00:34:58,931 --> 00:35:02,142
- So who are you?
- I'm the trainer for the Iceland team.

502
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:04,686
My name is Marria.

503
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:19,118
Well, you have a way
with the ladies.

504
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:24,206
We haven't formally met.
I'm Gordon Bombay, coach of Team U.S.A.

505
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:26,250
I know my competition.
I know you.

506
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:29,753
Yeah, but do you know the real me?

507
00:35:33,507 --> 00:35:37,427
You're full of confidence.
Cocky. American.

508
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:39,680
I like that.

509
00:35:40,806 --> 00:35:42,891
It will make our triumph
even more enjoyable.

510
00:35:44,518 --> 00:35:48,230
Your triumph? Lighten up a little bit.
We're all just here to have a little--

511
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:49,940
A little fun, right?

512
00:35:51,108 --> 00:35:52,442
Don't you worry.

513
00:35:53,193 --> 00:35:55,529
We will. We will.

514
00:36:05,372 --> 00:36:07,791
<i>It's been all Team U.S.A. tonight.</i>

515
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:11,003
<i>They lead Italy six to nothing.
They've really dominated this game.</i>

516
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:13,297
<i>Italy with the puck across the line.</i>

517
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,966
<i>D'Agistino shoots.
Glove save by Goldberg.</i>

518
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:18,218
Have no fear!
Goldberg is here!

519
00:36:18,302 --> 00:36:21,221
Hey, man, there was nothing on that.
How about a real shot?

520
00:36:21,305 --> 00:36:23,640
Hey, <i>paisan,</i> meatballs
are slowing you down?

521
00:36:24,141 --> 00:36:26,977
Uh, how do you say,
in Italiano, "wussy"?

522
00:36:27,311 --> 00:36:29,730
Break it up! Break it up!

523
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:32,649
- Goldberg!
- What'd I say?

524
00:36:33,609 --> 00:36:34,860
Hey, look!

525
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:44,244
Yeah!

526
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:56,465
Yeah! Yeah!

527
00:37:00,928 --> 00:37:03,388
Okay, people.
Come on, let's do this.

528
00:37:32,376 --> 00:37:35,295
Gordon, take a look around you.
You gotta change your thinking.

529
00:37:35,379 --> 00:37:37,297
- What'd ya mean?
- You see in this town,

530
00:37:37,381 --> 00:37:40,008
everybody is something
other than what they really are.

531
00:37:40,092 --> 00:37:41,969
Hi, I'm Terry. I'll be your server.

532
00:37:42,052 --> 00:37:45,389
Terry, let me ask you a question.
What do you really want to be?

533
00:37:45,514 --> 00:37:46,932
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

534
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:50,477
- Head of production for a major studio.
- Yes, perfect.

535
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,854
Thank you. We're done.
See what I mean?

536
00:37:52,938 --> 00:37:55,357
Everybody wants to be
something bigger.

537
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:59,945
Listen, all I'm saying is
you could be big. I mean Costas big.

538
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:02,948
N.H.L. stars Neely,
Chelios and Robitaille.

539
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:06,451
Cam, Chris and Luc, this is
Gordon Bombay, coach of Team U.S.A.

540
00:38:07,327 --> 00:38:11,456
Gordon, Greg Louganis,
Kristi Yamaguchi, our Olympians.

541
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:12,666
Hello. Nice to meet you.

542
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:15,794
Hey Kareem, meet Gordon Bombay,
coach of Team U.S.A.

543
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:17,379
- Hey Gordon, how ya doin'?
- Glad to meet ya.

544
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:20,674
Coaching. Okay, two words
about that: Pat Riley.

545
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:22,843
What it is, it's a loafer?

546
00:38:23,093 --> 00:38:27,222
And we'll call it the Air Bombay loafer
for kids who wanna coach.

547
00:38:28,598 --> 00:38:31,268
You think there's enough kids
out there who wanna coach?

548
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:32,394
Absolutely.

549
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:37,190
This don't look like
no Rodeo Drive to me.

550
00:38:37,274 --> 00:38:38,984
No, that's Ro-day-o Drive.

551
00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:42,529
You can't fool me. I saw it on the sign.
It says Rodeo Drive.

552
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:45,324
No, see, there's an accent at--
Never mind.

553
00:38:45,407 --> 00:38:47,951
I don't get it. This is Beverly Hills.
Where's all the hills?

554
00:38:48,035 --> 00:38:50,829
Where's that 90210 school?
What about the Hillbillies?

555
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:51,705
Where are the movie stars?

556
00:38:51,788 --> 00:38:53,999
Wasn't that the captain
from <i>The Love Boat?</i>

557
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:57,461
- Let's go check out some stores.
- Great. I gotta buy my mom a T-shirt.

558
00:38:57,544 --> 00:38:59,046
- She'll love it.
- Yeah.

559
00:39:00,547 --> 00:39:02,549
- This place looks good.
- Yeah!

560
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:05,385
Maybe they're not open.

561
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:08,305
Hey, there's a doorbell here.

562
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:12,517
<i>I'm sorry. We do not allow
unsupervised children into the store.</i>

563
00:39:12,893 --> 00:39:14,394
Can you make an exception?

564
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:17,147
<i>No, now go away
or the police will be called.</i>

565
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:19,566
If we were in Texas,
this wouldn't have happened.

566
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:21,318
We'll find some other place.

567
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:23,278
<i>Step back from the vehicle.</i>

568
00:39:23,362 --> 00:39:25,572
<i>You have activated
the theft-deterrent device.</i>

569
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:26,907
<i>Yes, hello.</i>

570
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:30,077
Hi, we'd like four burgers.
What do you want to drink?

571
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,705
<i>You kids get outta here!
Quit playin' with that thing!</i>

572
00:39:34,664 --> 00:39:36,083
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

573
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:37,584
<i>We do not allow unsupervised--</i>

574
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:39,586
I'm sure Uncle Aaron
will be very upset

575
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:41,797
to hear we were treated
with such disrespect.

576
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,632
<i>Aaron? Aaron Spelling?</i>

577
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:46,635
No, Hank Aaron.
Of course, Aaron Spelling.

578
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:50,180
Now, I want you to make yourselves
comfortable. Carole, beverages.

579
00:39:50,263 --> 00:39:52,474
And I will be with you
in a moment.

580
00:39:56,978 --> 00:40:00,148
- Gosh, this store sure is nice.
- Goldberg, my man.

581
00:40:00,232 --> 00:40:01,483
- Cheers.
- Yeah.

582
00:40:04,778 --> 00:40:07,280
I know you boys. You're, um--

583
00:40:07,406 --> 00:40:09,491
- Aaron Spelling's nephew.
- No.

584
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:13,662
- Team U.S.A. hockey.
- You guys are just great!

585
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:15,163
- Oh, thanks.
- Thanks.

586
00:40:16,832 --> 00:40:18,667
Now, a gift for your mother.

587
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:22,963
You'll want something light, airy.
It is summer, after all.

588
00:40:23,547 --> 00:40:25,632
I'm going to show you
my private collection.

589
00:40:42,816 --> 00:40:44,192
Nah, something else.

590
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:57,747
- No, it's not quite what I'm looking for.
- No.

591
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:18,351
Well, gentlemen, did you
see anything you liked?

592
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:21,771
You know, I gotta be honest.
My mom really needs...

593
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:23,899
a bikini.

594
00:41:25,484 --> 00:41:26,735
Hey! I don't get it!

595
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:29,404
<i>You little brats don't ever
come back into this store!</i>

596
00:41:29,613 --> 00:41:30,906
Anti-children!

597
00:41:31,281 --> 00:41:33,992
No, no, no. It's not a sneaker,
it's a street shoe.

598
00:41:34,075 --> 00:41:36,620
Like coaches wear.

599
00:41:37,037 --> 00:41:38,455
Yeah, come on in.

600
00:41:39,289 --> 00:41:40,874
Sure, with a pump. That'll work.

601
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:45,045
Go ahead, sit down.
We'll talk about it at dinner. Okay.

602
00:41:45,795 --> 00:41:47,214
What's up?

603
00:41:47,881 --> 00:41:51,301
I wanna play.
When am I gonna get my chance?

604
00:41:52,135 --> 00:41:53,762
Julie, Goldberg's on a hot streak.

605
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:56,264
I gotta stick with him
as long as we're winning.

606
00:41:56,473 --> 00:42:00,852
I understand. But I left my team in Maine
to show the world what I can do.

607
00:42:02,062 --> 00:42:04,981
- Just give it time.
- You will show the world.

608
00:42:05,482 --> 00:42:08,026
I promise. Okay?

609
00:42:09,194 --> 00:42:10,904
All right.
Now get outta here.

610
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:15,992
<i>Bom, bom</i>

611
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:19,704
- Look at them. Fulton.
- Fulton, talk to 'em.

612
00:42:19,788 --> 00:42:22,666
Uh, hey, ladies. Nice night
for a stroll, wouldn't you say?

613
00:42:22,749 --> 00:42:24,960
That was a good one!

614
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:26,711
No curfew's
gonna keep us down.

615
00:42:26,795 --> 00:42:28,213
- Yeah!
- Ice cream.

616
00:42:28,463 --> 00:42:31,383
<i>Wait a minute.
I thought Iceland was covered with ice.</i>

617
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:35,428
Iceland? No, it's very green.
I thought Greenland was green.

618
00:42:35,804 --> 00:42:39,432
Greenland is covered with ice,
and Iceland is very nice.

619
00:42:39,558 --> 00:42:40,725
Ah.

620
00:42:41,184 --> 00:42:43,687
I imagine it'd be like Minnesota,
where you're from.

621
00:42:44,104 --> 00:42:45,814
How do you know
where I'm from?

622
00:42:46,523 --> 00:42:48,066
I asked around.

623
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:51,278
Okay.

624
00:42:52,988 --> 00:42:55,615
Look at this. She's an Iceland chick.

625
00:42:55,824 --> 00:42:58,743
What's he doin' with her?
Great coach we got.

626
00:43:06,418 --> 00:43:08,837
All right, are we ready
for warm-ups? Let's go!

627
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,673
- Whoa!
- He's stylin'! Mr. Coach!

628
00:43:11,756 --> 00:43:13,425
Yeah, all right. All right.

629
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:16,219
Nice jacket. Did you get
two pairs of pants with that?

630
00:43:18,138 --> 00:43:20,849
- Good night last night, Coach?
- Yeah, it was fine.

631
00:43:21,641 --> 00:43:22,892
What'd ya do?

632
00:43:23,393 --> 00:43:26,187
Oh, I... just watched some TV,
got to bed early.

633
00:43:26,271 --> 00:43:28,148
But not without
a little dessert, right?

634
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:31,860
A little ice cream, maybe?

635
00:43:32,277 --> 00:43:34,195
- Nice haircut.
- What, ya lose a bet?

636
00:43:38,325 --> 00:43:41,953
Live from Los Angeles,
welcome to the Junior Goodwill Games.

637
00:43:42,037 --> 00:43:44,998
Tonight's matchup, Team U.S.A.
faces off against Team Iceland.

638
00:43:45,081 --> 00:43:46,207
Cakewalk.

639
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:49,002
We have with us Greg Goldberg,
goaltender for Team U.S.A.

640
00:43:49,085 --> 00:43:52,422
Greg, what is it gonna take to beat
these feisty Icelanders tonight?

641
00:43:52,505 --> 00:43:56,051
I think it'll take a supreme
individual effort by me, Greg Goldberg.

642
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:58,345
Let's play hockey, gentlemen.

643
00:43:58,428 --> 00:43:59,721
Okay, cut it.

644
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:03,058
<i>Hi, everybody.
Welcome to today's game.</i>

645
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:06,478
<i>This is a very important matchup,
Team U.S.A. against Iceland...</i>

646
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:09,522
<i>in what could be a preview
of the championship game.</i>

647
00:44:09,606 --> 00:44:11,900
<i>Iceland, coached by
Wolf "The Dentist" Stansson.</i>

648
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:14,361
<i>He'll be taking on
Gordon Bombay.</i>

649
00:44:16,279 --> 00:44:17,822
Good luck, there, Coach.

650
00:44:18,114 --> 00:44:19,449
You'll sure need it.

651
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:29,459
What does that mean?

652
00:44:30,043 --> 00:44:31,419
You'll find out.

653
00:44:34,422 --> 00:44:36,758
Come on, fool! Get up!

654
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:39,052
- You ran at him unprovoked.
- Huh?

655
00:44:40,136 --> 00:44:43,390
- Calm down, son. You're out of the game.
- Give me a break!

656
00:44:43,473 --> 00:44:46,309
You're throwin' him out?
You can't do that!

657
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:48,144
It's three seconds into the game!

658
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:52,649
Oh, man.

659
00:45:00,115 --> 00:45:02,617
Come and get it.

660
00:45:09,332 --> 00:45:11,960
Wake up, defense.
Can't do this all myself.

661
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:13,753
Hey, Goldberg!

662
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,506
If that puck was a cheeseburger,
you'd stop it!

663
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:29,018
Yee-haw!

664
00:45:30,729 --> 00:45:32,647
Pass the puck, Dwayne!
Come on!

665
00:45:32,772 --> 00:45:36,151
- Dwayne, give me the puck!
- Pass it to Fulton! Dwayne, pass it!

666
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:40,905
- Look out, Dwayne!
- Yee-haw! Aah!

667
00:45:42,699 --> 00:45:44,075
Oh, man!

668
00:45:44,617 --> 00:45:48,580
I can't believe this is happening!
I should be out there!

669
00:45:48,663 --> 00:45:52,000
<i>...missing big
Dean Portman, it's one-nothing Iceland.</i>

670
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:55,211
<i>Iceland outhitting and
outskating Team U.S.A</i>

671
00:45:55,295 --> 00:45:57,589
<i>all over the ice
in the first period.</i>

672
00:45:57,672 --> 00:46:00,091
<i>Here's Gunnar Stahl
again for Iceland.</i>

673
00:46:00,175 --> 00:46:03,595
<i>Team U.S.A. can't stop him.
On the backhand, saved by Goldberg.</i>

674
00:46:03,678 --> 00:46:06,014
<i>Captain Adam Banks has it
for Team U.S.A.</i>

675
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:09,184
<i>He gets knocked head over heels.</i>

676
00:46:09,434 --> 00:46:13,438
<i>Team U.S.A. still with the puck.
Luis Mendoza, he can really fly.</i>

677
00:46:13,521 --> 00:46:15,607
<i>Mendoza across the blue line.</i>

678
00:46:15,732 --> 00:46:18,610
<i>He gets tripped,
slides into the boards.</i>

679
00:46:18,735 --> 00:46:20,570
Come on, Ref, call something.

680
00:46:21,237 --> 00:46:23,615
We're in trouble, Ken.
What can you do for us?

681
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:24,824
Let's see.

682
00:46:24,908 --> 00:46:29,454
Uh, a triple aerial with a Double
Hamill Camel that should split the D,

683
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:32,332
then a pirouetting
half-toe-touch for the goal.

684
00:46:32,415 --> 00:46:33,625
Show it to me, son.

685
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:36,085
Come on, Kenny.
Get us back in the game.

686
00:46:36,169 --> 00:46:37,921
I'm sure
you can do it, Ken.

687
00:46:48,264 --> 00:46:50,683
Aw, man. Aw.

688
00:46:51,267 --> 00:46:52,519
Aw.

689
00:46:57,315 --> 00:46:58,441
Was that it?

690
00:47:00,693 --> 00:47:03,404
Please give me one more
chance to get those guys!

691
00:47:03,655 --> 00:47:06,366
<i>They've got to get back into this game.</i>

692
00:47:06,491 --> 00:47:08,034
<i>Iceland with the puck.</i>

693
00:47:08,117 --> 00:47:10,495
<i>Here's Olaf Sanderson
right down the middle.</i>

694
00:47:10,578 --> 00:47:12,372
<i>Sanderson over to Stahl.
He scores!</i>

695
00:47:17,168 --> 00:47:18,545
Where's our concentration?

696
00:47:18,962 --> 00:47:22,632
You guys are runnin' around like a bunch
of chickens with your heads cut off!

697
00:47:23,007 --> 00:47:24,259
We're doin' our best.

698
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:26,427
Well, your best isn't
good enough any more.

699
00:47:26,511 --> 00:47:29,681
Blow this game and we are
one loss away from elimination.

700
00:47:30,473 --> 00:47:33,852
You guys might want to go home early,
but I sure as heck don't.

701
00:47:37,146 --> 00:47:39,023
My, that was inspiring.

702
00:47:39,774 --> 00:47:43,319
<i>Four-nothing,
Iceland, as we head for the final period.</i>

703
00:47:43,403 --> 00:47:45,572
<i>I hope Bombay's got some
magic up his sleeve,</i>

704
00:47:45,655 --> 00:47:48,157
<i>because he's getting manhandled tonight.</i>

705
00:48:00,086 --> 00:48:03,673
No! No.

706
00:48:06,217 --> 00:48:07,760
You're off, Goldberg!

707
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:11,764
Ah, thank you.

708
00:48:13,057 --> 00:48:15,310
Hey, good luck, goalie.
You're gonna need it.

709
00:48:15,393 --> 00:48:16,686
Thanks, Goldberg.

710
00:48:19,105 --> 00:48:22,609
- Sending in a woman to do a man's job.
- Don't break a nail.

711
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:28,573
I'm sorry, boys, but can you
help me with my pads, please?

712
00:48:28,865 --> 00:48:30,241
Yeah.

713
00:48:32,911 --> 00:48:35,747
<i>Intent to injure!
You're out of the game!</i>

714
00:48:35,872 --> 00:48:38,708
- See ya around, fellas.
- Aw, geez.

715
00:48:40,543 --> 00:48:42,003
Thanks for the breather.

716
00:48:43,004 --> 00:48:46,215
- Fulton! Get out there and blast one!
- Go on in!

717
00:48:47,216 --> 00:48:49,510
<i>Fulton Reed on the ice for Team U.S.A.</i>

718
00:48:49,594 --> 00:48:53,723
<i>- He's open to the blue line.</i>
- Fulton, fire it in there!

719
00:48:53,848 --> 00:48:55,058
<i>Reed winding up--</i>

720
00:48:57,101 --> 00:48:58,937
<i>Whoa! Glove save by Seggi.</i>

721
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:00,897
<i>Oh, what a save!</i>

722
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:04,233
<i>He'll have an imprint of a puck
in his palm after that one!</i>

723
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:12,951
- Hi.
- I know how you feel.

724
00:49:14,118 --> 00:49:16,287
<i>Here's Banks, starts onto the ice</i>

725
00:49:16,371 --> 00:49:19,374
<i>moves along the left wing side,
now moves into the center, but--</i>

726
00:49:19,457 --> 00:49:21,876
<i>A spinning move!
A great move to the blue line.</i>

727
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,796
<i>Banks all alone.
He scores!</i>

728
00:49:25,463 --> 00:49:27,340
Yeah, we got one!

729
00:49:29,509 --> 00:49:30,551
Hey!

730
00:49:31,886 --> 00:49:34,222
Come on! Relax!
Take it easy!

731
00:49:34,681 --> 00:49:36,724
- Calm down, son.
- Are you okay?

732
00:49:36,849 --> 00:49:39,143
- I'm all right. I'm okay.
- Are you sure?

733
00:49:39,268 --> 00:49:41,813
He scored!

734
00:49:45,566 --> 00:49:47,902
- Sit down. Right in there.
- Sanderson!

735
00:49:48,027 --> 00:49:50,446
In my country,
we call that a love tap.

736
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:53,282
I want a piece of you,
Sanderson! You're mine!

737
00:49:53,366 --> 00:49:55,535
- Oh, you think it's funny?
- Come on, get down!

738
00:49:55,618 --> 00:49:57,495
I want you!

739
00:49:57,620 --> 00:50:00,748
<i>Hey, man, don't touch me!</i>

740
00:50:04,085 --> 00:50:06,045
C'mon, Charlie!
That's it!

741
00:50:15,096 --> 00:50:17,306
- Iceland!
- Olaf.

742
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:19,642
Ja, Coach.

743
00:50:19,726 --> 00:50:21,686
<i>- Good game, Coach.</i>
- Thanks, Ref.

744
00:50:24,272 --> 00:50:25,565
Damn it!

745
00:50:32,572 --> 00:50:34,907
Twelve to one, huh?
Twelve to one.

746
00:50:35,324 --> 00:50:37,744
Ya think Hendrix is interested
in backing a loser?

747
00:50:37,827 --> 00:50:39,787
Gordon-- Hey, how are ya?

748
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:43,249
You're only good to us
if you win.

749
00:50:43,875 --> 00:50:46,002
Don, I'm-- I've--

750
00:50:46,419 --> 00:50:49,714
I-- I've been good to you, man.
I gave ya a real shot.

751
00:50:49,797 --> 00:50:53,551
A real shot to be somebody
and this is how you repay me.

752
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:57,221
We just didn't have the magic tonight.

753
00:50:57,430 --> 00:51:00,558
Well, you better get the damn magic,
and you better get it fast.

754
00:51:00,683 --> 00:51:04,645
Or I'm out of a job, and you're on your
way back to Palookaville, Minnesota,

755
00:51:04,729 --> 00:51:07,023
shoveling snow
and sharpening skates.

756
00:51:07,732 --> 00:51:09,108
Have a nice night.

757
00:51:13,905 --> 00:51:15,198
Twelve to one.

758
00:51:16,991 --> 00:51:19,118
Twelve to one.

759
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:23,289
You know what word comes to mind
when you think of that? Hmm?

760
00:51:24,957 --> 00:51:26,209
Pathetic!

761
00:51:28,252 --> 00:51:30,254
You guys were brought
here to play hockey.

762
00:51:30,588 --> 00:51:33,091
- What about you?
- What about me, Jesse?

763
00:51:33,174 --> 00:51:36,260
Coach Stansson knew everything about us.
They were ready for us.

764
00:51:36,344 --> 00:51:38,805
<i>And you spend your time
driving around in convertibles</i>

765
00:51:38,888 --> 00:51:40,431
<i>talking to those sponsor fools.</i>

766
00:51:40,515 --> 00:51:43,935
Or hanging with the Iceland lady.
We saw you two Saturday night.

767
00:51:44,644 --> 00:51:46,813
Eating ice cream
with the enemy, huh, coach?

768
00:51:46,938 --> 00:51:49,690
What? What are you talking about?
What's going on?

769
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:55,822
Hey. Hey, what I do
is none of your business. Is that clear?

770
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:01,202
Don't take those pads off.

771
00:52:01,327 --> 00:52:04,080
Everyone stay in your gear.
We have practice.

772
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:06,290
Tonight?

773
00:52:27,395 --> 00:52:29,230
This isn't
very much fun, Coach.

774
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:31,566
Who said it was
supposed to be fun?

775
00:52:32,525 --> 00:52:34,485
You did, when you
coached the Ducks.

776
00:52:35,319 --> 00:52:37,280
Well, I don't see
any Ducks here, Charlie.

777
00:52:37,363 --> 00:52:40,908
All I see is Team U.S.A.
one loss away from elimination.

778
00:52:42,618 --> 00:52:44,495
Twenty more sprints!
Let's go!

779
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:47,707
Line up! Come on, let's go!

780
00:52:47,832 --> 00:52:50,001
Line up, Charlie!

781
00:52:51,544 --> 00:52:54,213
Let's go! Keep you here
all night if I have to.

782
00:53:10,646 --> 00:53:13,191
Not my best...

783
00:53:13,316 --> 00:53:14,609
Luis.

784
00:53:16,277 --> 00:53:17,403
Sorry.

785
00:53:19,697 --> 00:53:20,990
All right, let's go!

786
00:53:23,284 --> 00:53:24,243
Team?

787
00:53:27,413 --> 00:53:28,581
Hello!

788
00:53:30,875 --> 00:53:32,168
Hey, guys.

789
00:53:33,419 --> 00:53:35,838
- Hello?
- I canceled their practice.

790
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:41,135
- What're ya talkin' about? Where are they?
- They needed a day off. Trust me.

791
00:53:41,219 --> 00:53:43,387
I need 'em here to practice!

792
00:53:43,471 --> 00:53:45,264
Well, they need to rest.

793
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,767
You've been running
those children ragged.

794
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:51,395
They can barely stay awake in class.
They're calling you Captain Blood.

795
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:54,774
I am preparing these kids for battle.
Can you understand that?

796
00:53:54,857 --> 00:53:57,235
We win the gold,
we go on to bigger things.

797
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:58,778
- Bigger things?
- That's right!

798
00:53:58,861 --> 00:54:00,988
Please! Gordon, it's a game!

799
00:54:01,197 --> 00:54:04,408
You said it yourself.
Games should be fun. Remember?

800
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:10,623
- And hold, two, three--
- Coach isn't here. Why do we have to be?

801
00:54:10,706 --> 00:54:13,084
We have a game tonight.
We have to work out.

802
00:54:15,378 --> 00:54:17,004
I say mutiny.
Who's with me?

803
00:54:17,088 --> 00:54:19,173
Goldberg,
I'm too tired to mutiny.

804
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:22,802
Come on, guys, it's not like
we couldn't use the conditioning.

805
00:54:22,927 --> 00:54:26,472
- Speak for yourself, babe.
- Her name is Julie, not "babe."

806
00:54:26,722 --> 00:54:30,393
- Don't tell me how to talk, rich boy!
- Hey, Portman, chill!

807
00:54:30,476 --> 00:54:33,729
Hey, you want a piece of this?

808
00:54:33,813 --> 00:54:37,900
<i>Yo, Team U.S.A., what are you gonna
do today, a million jumping jacks?</i>

809
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:40,945
This kid's crazier than me.
Forget about him. Look, Fulton!

810
00:54:41,028 --> 00:54:43,322
- Hey, chill!
- Hey, man, I'm gettin' sick of you!

811
00:54:43,406 --> 00:54:47,118
I'm gettin' sick of seeing the U.S.A.
represented by a bunch of whining babies.

812
00:54:47,201 --> 00:54:49,120
Too bad you can't back up that mouth.

813
00:54:49,203 --> 00:54:51,497
Me and my boys can take you
anytime, anywhere.

814
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:54,333
- I don't see no "boys."
- I got 'em waitin'.

815
00:54:54,417 --> 00:54:57,086
Grab your gear and let's go play
some schoolyard puck.

816
00:54:57,169 --> 00:55:00,089
<i>Or maybe you forgot what
it's like to play for real pride.</i>

817
00:55:00,172 --> 00:55:03,175
- You got a pass?
- It's not too far, you little wimps.

818
00:55:03,259 --> 00:55:05,386
- Come on!
- What are you doin'? Get off me!

819
00:55:05,469 --> 00:55:07,013
- Let's go.
- You comin' or not?

820
00:55:09,223 --> 00:55:13,060
My little brother Russ here's been telling
me that you have been chokin' big time.

821
00:55:13,144 --> 00:55:14,812
Your brother's got a big mouth.

822
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:18,566
Uh-oh.

823
00:55:21,694 --> 00:55:23,195
He does, doesn't he?

824
00:55:24,113 --> 00:55:25,197
Oh, boy.

825
00:55:25,281 --> 00:55:28,075
We thought we'd call you
all to see what you got.

826
00:55:28,159 --> 00:55:30,911
We know you can talk to the press
and sign autographs.

827
00:55:30,995 --> 00:55:32,705
- We can do more than that.
- Yeah?

828
00:55:32,788 --> 00:55:35,374
We can teach you to play
like the real Team U.S.A.

829
00:55:35,458 --> 00:55:37,084
What would you know
about it?

830
00:55:39,795 --> 00:55:42,590
You gotta earn every inch.

831
00:55:59,023 --> 00:56:00,900
- Come on!
- Get him!

832
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:13,496
Hey, ain't no whistles out here either.

833
00:56:13,579 --> 00:56:15,956
You keep diggin'
until you score that goal!

834
00:56:16,082 --> 00:56:18,667
Pick it up!

835
00:56:19,502 --> 00:56:21,504
- He scores!
- All right, Russ!

836
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:26,509
And then you take a few breaths,
slug some water

837
00:56:26,592 --> 00:56:30,137
and get out there and do it again!

838
00:56:33,391 --> 00:56:35,309
Don't just stand there.
Come and get it.

839
00:56:36,352 --> 00:56:37,686
Don't mind if I do.

840
00:56:38,521 --> 00:56:40,272
Yeah, Luis!

841
00:56:44,068 --> 00:56:46,362
Whoa! Not again!

842
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:51,283
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Use the brakes, baby.

843
00:57:01,127 --> 00:57:04,713
- Eh, no sweat. It happens all the time.
- Excuse me.

844
00:57:05,256 --> 00:57:09,260
- Throw it back, please.
- Here, kid. Alley-oop.

845
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:14,682
<i>All right, get it!</i>

846
00:57:15,141 --> 00:57:16,684
Yeah!

847
00:57:16,767 --> 00:57:20,521
- Yeah, Charlie!
<i>- Yeah!</i>

848
00:57:30,948 --> 00:57:33,409
Yeah! All right!

849
00:57:34,618 --> 00:57:36,036
Did you see that?

850
00:57:36,537 --> 00:57:38,706
What the heck
kinda shot was that?

851
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:41,208
- Ah, you like that, huh?
- Yeah.

852
00:57:41,459 --> 00:57:45,754
That's my knucklepuck. It's hard to be
accurate but it drives goalies crazy.

853
00:57:45,838 --> 00:57:47,256
Let's play!

854
00:57:48,048 --> 00:57:50,885
<i>Come on, Danny, come to me!</i>

855
00:57:50,968 --> 00:57:52,428
<i>Yeah!</i>

856
00:57:54,054 --> 00:57:56,307
- Yeah!
- Way to go!

857
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:59,560
Sweet move, kid.

858
00:58:00,144 --> 00:58:02,104
- All right!
- Aw, you done messed up now!

859
00:58:02,188 --> 00:58:04,565
Come here, I'm gonna get you!
Come here. Come here!

860
00:58:04,648 --> 00:58:08,569
Come here, junior! Come here! No.
I'm just messin' with you, okay. Listen.

861
00:58:08,652 --> 00:58:11,822
When a guy comes at you
like I just did, you do this,

862
00:58:11,906 --> 00:58:15,117
Stick, gloves and shirt.

863
00:58:17,244 --> 00:58:19,205
- Okay?
- Yeah, okay.

864
00:58:19,288 --> 00:58:20,581
My turn.

865
00:58:20,664 --> 00:58:24,376
Stick, gloves,
shirt.

866
00:58:25,836 --> 00:58:27,546
- All right?
- All right.

867
00:58:33,886 --> 00:58:36,931
All right, you guys, go get 'em!

868
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:40,559
- All right! Come on, go get 'em!
- You guys do it, okay?

869
00:58:40,643 --> 00:58:42,311
- All right!
- Play hard!

870
00:58:49,443 --> 00:58:51,612
Go, U.S.A. Go get 'em.

871
00:59:11,674 --> 00:59:13,884
<i>This is not a place for a coach.</i>

872
00:59:17,304 --> 00:59:19,181
<i>So who's looking after the shop?</i>

873
00:59:19,723 --> 00:59:20,933
We are closed.

874
00:59:21,934 --> 00:59:23,435
First time in ten years.

875
00:59:25,062 --> 00:59:27,189
I saw the Iceland game
on television.

876
00:59:28,649 --> 00:59:32,027
Who was that man in the suit
with the wet hair? Was it raining?

877
00:59:32,403 --> 00:59:33,862
It's a style, Jan

878
00:59:33,946 --> 00:59:36,365
You looked like
you just got out of the shower.

879
00:59:37,074 --> 00:59:41,161
You came 2,000 miles to make fun of me?
You could have done this over the phone.

880
00:59:41,287 --> 00:59:44,123
On TV, you looked like
a man who needs a friend.

881
00:59:46,375 --> 00:59:48,752
You don't understand.

882
00:59:50,337 --> 00:59:51,505
Gordon...

883
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:56,093
when I told the Goodwill Committee
who you were...

884
00:59:57,094 --> 00:59:59,805
I did not talk to them
about your good looks.

885
01:00:00,431 --> 01:00:03,142
I didn't tell them
you would win at any cost.

886
01:00:04,852 --> 01:00:07,521
I told them you were a man
who loves the game.

887
01:00:08,897 --> 01:00:12,401
And I told them you were a man
who could teach the kids

888
01:00:12,610 --> 01:00:15,070
about more than just
winning or losing.

889
01:00:16,697 --> 01:00:19,325
I told them you were
the Minnesota Miracle Man.

890
01:00:19,825 --> 01:00:23,120
And only you could teach them to fly.

891
01:00:25,122 --> 01:00:26,540
So be that man.

892
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:29,627
Be that man, Gordon.

893
01:01:22,554 --> 01:01:25,891
<i>Hey, team! Hey, team.
We're gonna be great today, right?</i>

894
01:01:26,266 --> 01:01:28,143
- Where's Gordon?
- You tell us.

895
01:01:28,477 --> 01:01:31,855
I don't believe this.
Team U.S.A. I'm sorry.

896
01:01:31,939 --> 01:01:34,858
But without a coach behind the bench,
you'll forfeit the game.

897
01:01:34,942 --> 01:01:37,695
- But you can't do that.
- We have one.

898
01:01:37,986 --> 01:01:39,279
Miss MacKay!

899
01:01:42,366 --> 01:01:44,034
Hey, Charlie, what's up?

900
01:01:44,118 --> 01:01:46,995
You have to pretend you're a coach
or we forfeit the game.

901
01:01:47,121 --> 01:01:50,666
- Where's Coach Bombay?
- Pretend or we're out of the tournament.

902
01:01:50,749 --> 01:01:52,793
But I don't know anything
about coaching.

903
01:01:58,173 --> 01:02:01,427
Here she is, our coach, Coach MacKay.

904
01:02:02,594 --> 01:02:03,595
Yeah.

905
01:02:04,930 --> 01:02:06,181
Come on, Coach MacKay.

906
01:02:06,265 --> 01:02:09,518
What are you waitin' for,
ice to freeze? Let's play!

907
01:02:10,018 --> 01:02:12,479
Let's go.

908
01:02:12,604 --> 01:02:13,814
Yes!

909
01:02:13,939 --> 01:02:16,442
<i>Face-off at center ice.
Germany wins the draw.</i>

910
01:02:16,525 --> 01:02:19,653
<i>Comes across the U.S.A. blue line.
Germany on the right wing side.</i>

911
01:02:19,737 --> 01:02:21,822
<i>Down to big Klaus Stabias.
He shoots!</i>

912
01:02:21,905 --> 01:02:24,867
<i>And a save by Goldberg.
Great save by Goldberg.</i>

913
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:28,120
<i>As Germany is really
throwing their weight around.</i>

914
01:02:28,746 --> 01:02:30,748
Oh! We look tired.

915
01:02:31,165 --> 01:02:33,584
We need to, uh... trade places.

916
01:02:33,876 --> 01:02:36,378
- What?
- New players.

917
01:02:36,670 --> 01:02:39,465
- Oh, say, "Change it up."
- Change it up.

918
01:02:39,590 --> 01:02:41,717
- Scream it!
- Change it up!

919
01:02:48,474 --> 01:02:49,683
Cool.

920
01:02:51,602 --> 01:02:54,563
<i>We're late in the period
with a face off coming up.</i>

921
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:04,698
- Look who finally shows up.
- No way, guys! Just ignore him.

922
01:03:04,782 --> 01:03:06,700
- Averman, take the face-off.
- All right.

923
01:03:30,808 --> 01:03:32,601
- What do we got to lose?
- Respect.

924
01:03:32,684 --> 01:03:34,686
He'll dump us the minute it's all over.

925
01:03:34,770 --> 01:03:36,939
Come on in!
Let's go, come on.

926
01:03:41,819 --> 01:03:43,070
Thanks.

927
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:51,495
Team.

928
01:03:54,373 --> 01:03:55,624
Guys.

929
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:58,168
I was wrong.

930
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:03,715
And I'm sorry.
I forgot about the team.

931
01:04:04,341 --> 01:04:06,385
And the team is all I have.

932
01:04:08,428 --> 01:04:10,889
All I want is another chance.

933
01:04:11,807 --> 01:04:13,600
Just one more shot.

934
01:04:15,018 --> 01:04:17,563
I'm back. Okay?

935
01:04:21,024 --> 01:04:23,485
Believe me.

936
01:04:26,738 --> 01:04:28,031
Together now.

937
01:04:36,665 --> 01:04:38,208
Come on, Jesse.

938
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:46,258
- Jesse, just do it, man!
- All right, let's go! Flying "V"! Come on!

939
01:04:46,341 --> 01:04:49,136
<i>Hall joined by his teammates
behind the Team U.S.A.</i>

940
01:04:49,219 --> 01:04:53,223
<i>net in the third period.
They start back out and they form a "V".</i>

941
01:04:53,307 --> 01:04:55,726
<i>I've heard of this before
but I've never seen it.</i>

942
01:04:55,809 --> 01:04:58,353
<i>It's the Flying "V" led by Jesse Hall.</i>

943
01:04:58,437 --> 01:05:02,024
<i>Hall up to center ice.
Hall with it toward the Germany blue line.</i>

944
01:05:02,107 --> 01:05:04,776
<i>Hall-- Shot by Averman. He scores!</i>

945
01:05:11,116 --> 01:05:12,367
Yes!

946
01:05:19,708 --> 01:05:22,836
I've had a lot of big distractions
since I've been here in L.A.

947
01:05:23,211 --> 01:05:24,546
This is a distraction.

948
01:05:26,214 --> 01:05:29,676
- Nice haircut, Coach.
- Looks familiar. I know that guy.

949
01:05:32,846 --> 01:05:34,514
This is a fire in a barrel.

950
01:05:41,438 --> 01:05:43,899
This is a distraction
in a fire in a barrel.

951
01:05:44,232 --> 01:05:46,818
- Any questions?
- Good job, Coach.

952
01:05:46,902 --> 01:05:49,571
All right!

953
01:05:51,281 --> 01:05:54,493
All right, Coach!

954
01:05:57,871 --> 01:05:59,748
We've got a lot of work to do.

955
01:05:59,831 --> 01:06:02,584
We've gotta study our opponents
and study ourselves.

956
01:06:06,338 --> 01:06:08,131
<i>We have to learn from our mistakes.</i>

957
01:06:08,757 --> 01:06:11,885
<i>You all have special skills.
Now we have to refine them.</i>

958
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:14,388
Luis, your speed is a great weapon.

959
01:06:14,513 --> 01:06:16,348
Now you must learn to harness it.

960
01:06:17,057 --> 01:06:18,976
Let's do it.

961
01:06:23,313 --> 01:06:26,733
- Whoa!
<i>- We need to get back to basics.</i>

962
01:06:27,401 --> 01:06:30,988
<i>That's it. Dwayne, hustle. We're gonna
be a lean, mean, fighting machine.</i>

963
01:06:31,113 --> 01:06:33,198
Move that big butt.
Go!

964
01:06:34,825 --> 01:06:37,411
- Hey, how you feelin' today, Goldberg?
- Lean and mean.

965
01:06:37,869 --> 01:06:41,581
Banks!
Show me something, now! That's it!

966
01:06:41,873 --> 01:06:43,166
Good. Good.

967
01:06:46,378 --> 01:06:47,754
Hey, Banks, let's go!

968
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:50,090
Comin'. I'll be right there.

969
01:06:50,173 --> 01:06:53,969
<i>And no matter what, we'll work
together to overcome every obstacle.</i>

970
01:07:11,403 --> 01:07:13,822
Now just think how you'd play
with two good wrists.

971
01:07:13,947 --> 01:07:14,990
Coach.

972
01:07:16,241 --> 01:07:18,452
It's just a little sore. I'm okay.

973
01:07:19,995 --> 01:07:21,872
I should have spotted this sooner.

974
01:07:21,997 --> 01:07:23,749
Sorry, man, I wasn't doin' my job.

975
01:07:25,125 --> 01:07:27,044
Coach, I'm fine.
I can play, I swear.

976
01:07:27,502 --> 01:07:28,754
Okay.

977
01:07:31,631 --> 01:07:33,425
Here. Let's find out.

978
01:07:36,636 --> 01:07:37,804
The other hand.

979
01:07:42,934 --> 01:07:44,144
<i>Now rotate it.</i>

980
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:55,280
- I have to bench you.
- No! You can't do that.

981
01:07:55,363 --> 01:07:57,407
Adam, you could injure
yourself permanently.

982
01:07:57,491 --> 01:07:59,701
You can't bench me. I gotta play.

983
01:07:59,826 --> 01:08:02,496
All the scouts are here watching me.
This is my shot.

984
01:08:02,579 --> 01:08:05,624
You're young and you're gonna
have plenty of shots, believe me.

985
01:08:05,707 --> 01:08:07,334
But my dad's counting on me.

986
01:08:08,877 --> 01:08:10,587
I'm sorry.

987
01:08:16,468 --> 01:08:17,511
Hey.

988
01:08:19,513 --> 01:08:21,932
My dad worked a lot
when I was a kid.

989
01:08:22,974 --> 01:08:27,270
So when he made it to a game, I wanted
so bad to score 100 goals for him.

990
01:08:28,438 --> 01:08:31,817
I spent half the game a nervous wreck,
my stomach in knots.

991
01:08:32,734 --> 01:08:34,194
That's how I feel.

992
01:08:36,905 --> 01:08:41,618
Before he died, my dad told me
that his happiest times...

993
01:08:42,661 --> 01:08:45,831
were watching me skate on this pond
we had behind our house.

994
01:08:46,456 --> 01:08:49,209
He didn't need me
to score 100 goals for him.

995
01:08:50,502 --> 01:08:52,921
He was proud of me
because I was his son...

996
01:08:54,214 --> 01:08:55,799
and I did my best.

997
01:08:57,676 --> 01:08:59,719
I'm sure that's how
your dad feels.

998
01:09:01,763 --> 01:09:03,223
I know it is.

999
01:09:08,562 --> 01:09:09,855
Thanks, Coach.

1000
01:09:10,897 --> 01:09:13,650
All right. Let's go
get that wrist X-rayed.

1001
01:09:14,067 --> 01:09:15,277
<i>Come on.</i>

1002
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:17,779
That's the way.

1003
01:09:18,155 --> 01:09:20,615
<i>We will work
hard and we're gonna succeed.</i>

1004
01:09:24,744 --> 01:09:26,621
<i>Nothing will bring us down.</i>

1005
01:09:27,664 --> 01:09:30,083
<i>If we fall,
we'll get up and try it again.</i>

1006
01:09:30,292 --> 01:09:32,460
Way to get over
on your edge there, Connie!

1007
01:09:33,003 --> 01:09:35,338
Good, Portman, good.
Soft hands.

1008
01:09:41,970 --> 01:09:45,223
Coach. Coach, I know with Banks out,
we got a roster slot open.

1009
01:09:45,515 --> 01:09:46,474
Yeah?

1010
01:09:46,558 --> 01:09:49,895
<i>You know how I told you
I'd make a better coach than a player?</i>

1011
01:09:49,978 --> 01:09:52,230
<i>I did some scouting for us. Come on in!</i>

1012
01:09:54,232 --> 01:09:56,818
- Russ Tyler. Coach Bombay.
- Hiya, Coach.

1013
01:09:57,736 --> 01:10:00,697
Russ Tyler, huh.

1014
01:10:01,823 --> 01:10:03,992
<i>Well Russ, what can you do for the team?</i>

1015
01:10:04,826 --> 01:10:06,661
You never heard of my knucklepuck?

1016
01:10:07,204 --> 01:10:09,581
Knucklepuck? No.

1017
01:10:12,042 --> 01:10:15,253
<i>U.S.A. leading Russia

1019
01:10:18,465 --> 01:10:21,593
<i>- calling for the puck. He gets it.</i>
- It's knucklepuck time.

1020
01:10:21,676 --> 01:10:24,971
<i>He winds up. He shoots. He scores!</i>

1021
01:10:25,096 --> 01:10:28,433
Yeah!

1022
01:10:31,478 --> 01:10:33,688
- Yeah!
<i>- That's my stuff!</i>

1023
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:38,151
<i>I told him no visitors,
but he wanted to congratulate you anyway.</i>

1024
01:10:38,235 --> 01:10:40,862
That's Wayne Gretzky.

1025
01:10:40,946 --> 01:10:43,490
Can I shake your hand?

1026
01:10:43,573 --> 01:10:44,991
How ya doin'?

1027
01:10:45,450 --> 01:10:47,702
- This is The Great One.
- Wayne's fine.

1028
01:10:49,579 --> 01:10:52,374
- Say, hockey.
- Hockey!

1029
01:10:53,124 --> 01:10:56,127
<i>Powered by a one goal victory

<i>where they'll go up against

1032
01:11:05,637 --> 01:11:07,973
Coach, shouldn't we have
our hockey gear on?

1033
01:11:08,056 --> 01:11:10,642
- Yeah?
- Guys, this is our last team practice,

1034
01:11:10,725 --> 01:11:12,894
- which means--
- The return of Captain Blood.

1035
01:11:12,978 --> 01:11:14,896
No.

1036
01:11:15,063 --> 01:11:17,524
- It means...
- Let's have some fun.

1037
01:11:17,607 --> 01:11:19,025
All right!

1038
01:11:25,448 --> 01:11:27,492
- Easy, easy now.
- Whoa.

1039
01:11:27,575 --> 01:11:29,703
- Good.
- I love it.

1040
01:11:29,786 --> 01:11:31,621
I can skate.

1041
01:11:31,705 --> 01:11:33,957
Yes, he can skate.

1042
01:11:36,334 --> 01:11:39,129
Oh.

1043
01:12:11,036 --> 01:12:13,455
Playtime is over.
We have the ice now.

1044
01:12:14,247 --> 01:12:16,374
You and your little rink rats
must leave.

1045
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:18,877
We're right here, Coach.

1046
01:12:21,671 --> 01:12:24,257
The only thing little
was your career in the pros.

1047
01:12:26,176 --> 01:12:28,094
Gordon, no, let's go.

1048
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:32,515
Well, at least I had a shot.
I was there.

1049
01:12:32,849 --> 01:12:34,309
You were a disgrace.

1050
01:12:41,399 --> 01:12:42,817
All right, team,
we're outta here.

1051
01:12:43,735 --> 01:12:46,821
- Let's go, I said! Come on!
- Can you still move on the ice?

1052
01:12:47,447 --> 01:12:49,324
Well, please,
play a little with me.

1053
01:12:50,533 --> 01:12:53,703
Show me the famous triple deke
your dear daddy taught you.

1054
01:12:54,913 --> 01:12:56,956
Or was it that
old geezer over there?

1055
01:12:59,292 --> 01:13:00,460
Marria.

1056
01:13:11,513 --> 01:13:15,266
Three bar. First one to hit
both posts and the crossbar.

1057
01:13:15,809 --> 01:13:18,770
- Have to take it out past the blue line.
- I know the game.

1058
01:13:51,428 --> 01:13:53,680
Come on, Bombay.
Come on!

1059
01:13:54,055 --> 01:13:56,558
- That's it. That's it!
- Yeah!

1060
01:14:08,653 --> 01:14:11,614
News flash.

1061
01:14:11,698 --> 01:14:14,409
That wasn't even my triple deke.

1062
01:14:20,832 --> 01:14:22,834
One more post and you go home crying.

1063
01:14:22,959 --> 01:14:25,378
By the way, Stansson,
you owe me a beach ball.

1064
01:14:43,271 --> 01:14:46,483
It's all right.

1065
01:14:53,072 --> 01:14:55,867
Get your coach off the ice.
We have to practice now.

1066
01:14:55,950 --> 01:14:58,036
Stay back!
Back, back, back.

1067

Hi, everybody. This is Bob Miller
along with Jacques Berman.

1071
01:15:23,269 --> 01:15:27,065
Nice to have you with us for what
should be an exciting title game tonight.

1072
01:15:28,358 --> 01:15:29,651
Coach.

1073
01:15:31,319 --> 01:15:34,489
I woke up...
and the pain was gone.

1074
01:15:40,703 --> 01:15:43,248
Adam, I'm sorry,
but we already have a full roster.

1075
01:15:48,211 --> 01:15:49,504
He can have my spot.

1076
01:15:54,425 --> 01:15:56,302
It's what I can do for the team.

1077
01:15:57,470 --> 01:15:58,805
Let me do it.

1078
01:16:01,891 --> 01:16:05,645
Charlie, I need you on the bench,
coaching right there with me.

1079
01:16:09,065 --> 01:16:11,401
Take a deep breath.
Here we go.

1080
01:16:29,919 --> 01:16:32,797
<i>Now the two teams gather
at their respective benches.</i>

1081

<i>In their last meeting,

1082
01:16:37,010 --> 01:16:40,138
<i>Heads high! Stand tall! Fly straight!</i>

1083
01:16:40,388 --> 01:16:42,682
- U.S.A.!
- All the way!

1084
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:54,527
<i>We're ready for the opening
face-off in tonight's championship game.</i>

1085
01:16:54,611 --> 01:16:56,362
<i>Team U.S.A. against Iceland.</i>

1086

<i>Lester Averman will move in

1087
01:16:59,657 --> 01:17:02,035

Averman gets knocked down.</i>

1088
01:17:02,118 --> 01:17:05,371
<i>Iceland physically dominated

<i>Behind the net, Goldberg

1092
01:17:13,671 --> 01:17:15,256
<i>Here comes Dean Portman.</i>

1093
01:17:15,757 --> 01:17:18,926
<i>He's hit hard into the glass
by Gunnar Stahl.</i>

1094

<i>Iceland out to dominate

1095
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:25,016
<i>Puck is still in the U.S.A. zone.

<i>Stick save by Goldberg.
Good save.</i>

1097
01:17:27,477 --> 01:17:31,064
<i>Held in by Iceland.
Goldberg looks like he got tripped.</i>

1098
01:17:31,230 --> 01:17:33,232
<i>Iceland still with it.
Back behind the net.</i>

1099
01:17:33,316 --> 01:17:35,735
Here's a wraparound by Sanderson.

1100
01:17:35,818 --> 01:17:38,988
<i>He scores! Iceland gets
an early one-to-nothing lead.</i>

1101
01:17:39,072 --> 01:17:40,990
It's all right.
We'll get that one back.

1102
01:17:41,407 --> 01:17:44,410
Hey! Too slow, big boy.

1103
01:17:44,494 --> 01:17:48,206
All right! That's it!
Don't listen to him.

1104
01:17:48,289 --> 01:17:49,916
That guy'll kill you.

1105
01:17:49,999 --> 01:17:52,627
Well, at least hold me back
like I'm gonna kill him.

1106
01:17:52,710 --> 01:17:55,254
Come on, man!
Let me at him! Let me go!

1107
01:17:55,338 --> 01:17:58,007
You want some of this?
Let me at him!

1108
01:17:58,091 --> 01:17:59,467
Line change!

1109
01:18:00,009 --> 01:18:02,929
Guy, Jesse, Russ.

1110
01:18:03,304 --> 01:18:05,890
- You ready? Get out there.
- Yeah.

1111
01:18:10,728 --> 01:18:12,855
That's the shooter!
Watch him! Get him!

1112
01:18:18,152 --> 01:18:21,030
- There he is.
- There you go. That's my boy!

1113
01:18:21,114 --> 01:18:22,198
Cross sticks.

1114
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:31,791
What are you doin'? Get off me.

1115
01:18:31,874 --> 01:18:35,128
Boo!

1116
01:18:38,548 --> 01:18:41,342
- Over here, man. Gimme the puck.
- Shooter!

1117
01:18:41,718 --> 01:18:44,595
Watch out, boys.
It's knucklepuck time.

1118
01:18:47,682 --> 01:18:49,392
Aw, man,
I messed up.

1119
01:18:49,517 --> 01:18:53,730
<i>Iceland with a one-nothing lead.
Throwing everything they have at U.S.A.</i>

1120

<i>Team U.S.A. has to find a way
to get back in this game</i>

1121
01:19:12,039 --> 01:19:15,585
<i>because they are being totally dominated
by a bigger, faster Iceland team.</i>

1122
01:19:16,335 --> 01:19:20,131
We can't make it. Iceland's
bigger, stronger, faster.

1123
01:19:20,214 --> 01:19:21,883
They got more facial hair.

1124
01:19:32,226 --> 01:19:33,770
Banks, you're on.

1125
01:19:34,437 --> 01:19:36,314
Hey, be careful out there.

1126
01:19:49,535 --> 01:19:51,996
Sit down. Sit down.
Sit down. Sit down.

1127
01:19:52,079 --> 01:19:55,333
Hey Ref, why don't you call something?
He almost took his arm off!

1128
01:19:55,750 --> 01:19:58,669
That'll be two minutes.
Two minutes well worth it.

1129
01:19:58,753 --> 01:20:00,755
Get in the box,
you big goon.

1130
01:20:10,765 --> 01:20:11,808
I'm okay.

1131
01:20:13,226 --> 01:20:15,061
- You sure?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

1132
01:20:15,144 --> 01:20:17,730
They just hit the pad. Really.

1133
01:20:19,524 --> 01:20:20,900
You'll be okay, Banks.

1134
01:20:21,317 --> 01:20:23,319
Way to hang in there, Adam.
Great playing.

1135
01:20:31,661 --> 01:20:33,371
<i>Now the crowd
doing the wave,</i>

1136
01:20:33,454 --> 01:20:35,581
<i>trying to get Team U.S.A.

1137
01:20:35,665 --> 01:20:39,126
<i>It may be working.
Team U.S.A. up to center ice.</i>

1138
01:20:39,919 --> 01:20:41,754
<i>Moreau to the blue line of Iceland.</i>

1139
01:20:41,838 --> 01:20:44,006
<i>Drops it back to Mendoza.
Ducks under a check.</i>

1140
01:20:44,090 --> 01:20:46,259
<i>Robertson with it now for Team U.S.A.</i>

1141
01:20:46,342 --> 01:20:48,761
<i>He's got great moves with the puck.</i>

1142
01:20:48,845 --> 01:20:52,014
<i>Robertson still with it. Portman
calling for it in front of the net.</i>

1143
01:20:52,098 --> 01:20:55,560
<i>Robertson knocked down from behind.
Iceland will take over.</i>

1144
01:20:56,185 --> 01:20:58,312
- Somebody get on him.
<i>- Get him, Luis!</i>

1145
01:20:58,437 --> 01:21:02,358
<i>Here's Luis Mendoza
in a footrace trying to catch Amselik.</i>

1146
01:21:02,441 --> 01:21:05,152
<i>Amselik on a breakaway.
He could make it three-nothing.</i>

1147
01:21:05,236 --> 01:21:07,947
<i>Mendoza trying frantically to catch him.</i>

1148
01:21:08,030 --> 01:21:11,993
<i>Amselik moving in on Goldberg.
Gets hit from behind.</i>

1149
01:21:12,076 --> 01:21:14,871
<i>Taking the puck--</i>

1150
01:21:14,954 --> 01:21:19,166
<i>Amselik, Mendoza and the puck
all in the net. It's a goal.</i>

1151
01:21:19,333 --> 01:21:23,212
<i>And Iceland leads now...
three-to-nothing.</i>

1152
01:21:25,172 --> 01:21:27,383
Show me the Flying "V".
Let's go! Let's go!

1153
01:21:28,509 --> 01:21:30,469
Hey!

1154
01:21:51,490 --> 01:21:54,118
<i>And here's a four-on-none
break for Iceland.</i>

1155
01:21:54,201 --> 01:21:57,121
<i>Gunnar Stahl to Sanderson.
Wide open net and he scores.</i>

1156
01:21:58,623 --> 01:22:00,708
<i>Four-nothing, Iceland.</i>

1157
01:22:07,006 --> 01:22:10,301
And Iceland is really taking it
to Team U.S.A.

1158
01:22:10,384 --> 01:22:12,887
They are completely
dominating this game.

1159
01:22:12,970 --> 01:22:15,348
<i>As we start the second period,
you have to wonder</i>

1160
01:22:15,431 --> 01:22:19,644
<i>how is Team U.S.A. going to get back
in this. It's like David versus Goliath!</i>

1161
01:22:24,649 --> 01:22:25,816
<i>Oy, vey.</i>

1162
01:22:27,026 --> 01:22:31,364
You guys wanna ease up a little bit?
Just thought I'd ask. Come on, guys.

1163
01:22:32,031 --> 01:22:35,576
<i>Off the face-off, Averman gets
knocked down by Gunnar Stahl.</i>

1164
01:22:35,660 --> 01:22:37,662
<i>And the heavy hitting
by Iceland continues.</i>

1165
01:22:37,745 --> 01:22:41,832
<i>It's gonna take something drastic
for Team U.S.A. to turn this game around.</i>

1166
01:22:46,087 --> 01:22:47,672
Party!

1167
01:22:56,639 --> 01:22:59,392
Yeah!

1168
01:22:59,892 --> 01:23:03,229
<i>Iceland trying to pad
their lead in the second period.</i>

1169
01:23:03,604 --> 01:23:07,274
<i>Number 74 spins around.
He's right in the slot.</i>

1170
01:23:07,358 --> 01:23:09,902
<i>He shoots!
And a save by Goldberg.</i>

1171
01:23:10,361 --> 01:23:12,905
<i>Kenny Wu picks it up
behind the U.S.A. net.</i>

1172
01:23:13,030 --> 01:23:15,950
<i>Wu, the former Olympic skater
weaves his way up to center ice;</i>

1173
01:23:16,033 --> 01:23:18,244
<i>he's gonna try and split
the Iceland defense.</i>

1174
01:23:18,327 --> 01:23:19,328
Get him!

1175
01:23:29,130 --> 01:23:30,172
Pretty cool, huh?

1176
01:23:30,256 --> 01:23:32,633
<i>Fulton back to Wu.
He shoots. He scores!</i>

1177
01:23:32,717 --> 01:23:34,301
Yeah!

1178
01:23:37,263 --> 01:23:39,390
Yeah! Yeah! Yes!

1179
01:23:40,975 --> 01:23:45,438
<i>Wu! Wu! Wu! Kenny Wu...
puts Team U.S.A. on the board!</i>

1180
01:23:47,273 --> 01:23:49,608
What'd you think of that?
Pretty sweet, huh?

1181
01:23:50,901 --> 01:23:53,863
Hey, you wanna piece of me?
Here, take that.

1182
01:23:55,406 --> 01:23:56,824
- All right!
- Yeah!

1183
01:23:56,907 --> 01:23:59,118
- I taught him that.
- Yeah, I know, man!

1184
01:23:59,577 --> 01:24:02,872
- Come on! Let's go.
- Take that! What'd I do?

1185
01:24:02,997 --> 01:24:07,043
All right. All right. Grim up.
We still got a lot of work to do.

1186
01:24:08,544 --> 01:24:10,963
What are you doing out there?
Wake up!

1187
01:24:11,505 --> 01:24:14,467
- That'll be two minutes, son.
- Two minutes? Well worth it.

1188
01:24:18,429 --> 01:24:19,680
All right, Ken Wu!

1189
01:24:19,764 --> 01:24:21,307
Our little Bash Brother!

1190
01:24:21,390 --> 01:24:23,059
Yeah! He's our man!

1191
01:24:26,729 --> 01:24:30,191
Yeah! Get up!
Come on! Get up!

1192
01:24:30,441 --> 01:24:34,278
Hey, you guys, come on, get--
Let's play hockey!

1193
01:24:34,403 --> 01:24:37,448
- Yes!
- Yeah! Come on! Yeah!

1194
01:24:41,827 --> 01:24:45,247
Yes, let's hear it for the three
Bash Brothers entertaining the crowd.

1195
01:24:50,544 --> 01:24:52,213
Yeah!

1196
01:24:53,714 --> 01:24:55,091
Come on!

1197
01:24:55,174 --> 01:24:56,926
Let's go, come on.

1198
01:24:57,343 --> 01:25:01,013
<i>Fulton and Portman are gonna
get misconduct penalties here.</i>

1199
01:25:01,097 --> 01:25:02,848
<i>They're ushered into the penalty box</i>

1200
01:25:02,932 --> 01:25:05,392
<i>where they join Wu
and they're still going wild.</i>

1201
01:25:05,559 --> 01:25:07,812
<i>Now there's</i>
three <i>Bash Brothers.</i>

1202
01:25:08,145 --> 01:25:09,355
- Olaf!
<i>- Ja!</i>

1203
01:25:09,772 --> 01:25:11,732
Destroy!

1204
01:25:12,566 --> 01:25:15,027
Connie, be careful out there.
They're gunning for you.

1205
01:25:15,111 --> 01:25:16,695
Don't worry.
I'll be fine.

1206
01:25:38,175 --> 01:25:41,679
<i>Iceland on the attack again.
Uberjavik fires the puck in the corner.</i>

1207
01:25:41,762 --> 01:25:45,724
<i>Connie Moreau over to get it.
Sanderson has her lined up.</i>

1208
01:25:45,808 --> 01:25:47,268
<i>Get out of there!</i>

1209
01:25:49,436 --> 01:25:50,980
Yee-haw!

1210
01:25:51,981 --> 01:25:54,900
- No, Dwayne!
- I'm comin', Connie.

1211
01:26:09,707 --> 01:26:11,500
All right!

1212
01:26:15,504 --> 01:26:16,881
Get up there!

1213
01:26:17,298 --> 01:26:19,758
Where I come from, we treat
ladies with respect.

1214
01:26:19,842 --> 01:26:22,636
Thank you, Dwayne,
but I'm no lady; I'm a Duck!

1215
01:26:24,597 --> 01:26:26,891
- Come on!
- Way to go, you little filly.

1216
01:26:27,433 --> 01:26:28,642
I'll get you for th--

1217
01:26:29,018 --> 01:26:31,770
<i>Referee taking Robertson
over to the penalty box.</i>

1218
01:26:31,854 --> 01:26:34,148
<i>What are they gonna call this penalty?</i>

1219
01:26:34,398 --> 01:26:36,817
It's two minutes for roping?

1220
01:26:36,901 --> 01:26:40,321
<i>That's a new one on me.
We're at the end of the second period.</i>

1221
01:26:40,404 --> 01:26:43,324
<i>Iceland has a commanding
four-to-one lead.</i>

1222
01:26:43,782 --> 01:26:46,076
This isn't a hockey game;
it's a circus.

1223
01:26:52,708 --> 01:26:55,586
- Did you all enjoy that?
- Yeah!

1224
01:26:56,086 --> 01:26:57,671
So did they,

1225
01:26:57,755 --> 01:27:01,383
because they're still three points up
and we're one period away from defeat.

1226
01:27:03,219 --> 01:27:06,138
If we can't beat them,
we might as well keep our pride.

1227
01:27:06,222 --> 01:27:07,389
Yeah.

1228
01:27:09,058 --> 01:27:10,476
Jesse, that's not pride.

1229
01:27:11,352 --> 01:27:14,146
Sure, when Dwayne roped
that big oaf, part of me cheered.

1230
01:27:14,813 --> 01:27:17,524
But guys, I've been there.
I know how you feel.

1231
01:27:18,025 --> 01:27:21,862
I wanted to cream that jerk that busted
my knee when I played in the minors.

1232
01:27:22,279 --> 01:27:25,574
And I really, really wanted to go
after Stansson for that cheap shot.

1233
01:27:26,742 --> 01:27:28,953
But you know what?
My knee will heal.

1234
01:27:30,079 --> 01:27:31,830
And if I become
someone I'm not...

1235
01:27:32,748 --> 01:27:34,541
if I sink to their level...

1236
01:27:36,418 --> 01:27:38,420
well, then,
I lost more than my knee.

1237
01:27:40,381 --> 01:27:41,465
You understand?

1238
01:27:41,548 --> 01:27:43,676
Yeah.

1239
01:27:48,555 --> 01:27:50,849
We're not goons.
We're not bullies.

1240
01:27:51,976 --> 01:27:53,852
No matter
what people say or do...

1241
01:27:54,937 --> 01:27:56,563
we have to be ourselves.

1242
01:27:58,315 --> 01:27:59,984
You. Who are you?

1243
01:28:00,734 --> 01:28:02,444
- Dean Portman.
- From where?

1244
01:28:02,736 --> 01:28:04,363
- Chicago, Illinois.
- You.

1245
01:28:04,655 --> 01:28:06,156
- Guy Germaine.
- From where?

1246
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:07,574
From St. Paul, Minnesota.

1247
01:28:08,242 --> 01:28:10,869
- You.
- Jesse Hall from Minneapolis, Minnesota.

1248
01:28:11,245 --> 01:28:13,747
- Who are you?
- Julie Gaffney from Bangor, Maine.

1249
01:28:14,415 --> 01:28:16,500
Luis Mendoza. Miami, Florida.

1250
01:28:16,709 --> 01:28:18,669
Greg Goldberg.
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

1251
01:28:18,752 --> 01:28:20,671
Les Averman.
Brooklyn Park, Minnesota.

1252
01:28:20,879 --> 01:28:23,340
- Fulton Reed. Stillwater, Minnesota.
- That's right!

1253
01:28:23,424 --> 01:28:25,426
Russ Tyler.
South Central Los Angeles.

1254
01:28:25,551 --> 01:28:27,553
Charlie Conway.
Minneapolis, Minnesota.

1255
01:28:28,012 --> 01:28:30,097
Ken Wu.
San Francisco, California.

1256
01:28:30,347 --> 01:28:32,266
Connie Moreau.
Minneapolis, Minnesota.

1257
01:28:32,349 --> 01:28:34,018
Adam Banks.
Edina, Minnesota.

1258
01:28:34,184 --> 01:28:36,061
Dwayne Robertson.
Austin, Texas.

1259
01:28:36,353 --> 01:28:38,605
Michele MacKay.
Duluth, Minnesota.

1260
01:28:38,689 --> 01:28:41,275
And I'm Gordon Bombay.
Minneapolis, Minnesota.

1261
01:28:45,404 --> 01:28:48,991
We're Team U.S.A., gathered
from all across America.

1262
01:28:49,658 --> 01:28:51,827
And we're gonna stick together.
You know why?

1263
01:28:51,994 --> 01:28:53,746
Because we are Ducks.

1264
01:28:54,038 --> 01:28:57,166
- And ducks fly together.
- That's right, Jan.

1265
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,544
And just when you think
they're about to break apart--

1266
01:29:00,627 --> 01:29:02,046
Ducks fly together!

1267
01:29:02,254 --> 01:29:04,882
And when the wind blows hard
and the sky is black--

1268
01:29:04,965 --> 01:29:06,717
Ducks fly together!

1269
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:10,596
When the roosters are crowing and the cows
are spinning circles in the pasture--

1270
01:29:12,931 --> 01:29:15,809
- Okay.
- Ducks fly together!

1271
01:29:16,602 --> 01:29:18,562
And when everyone says
it can't be done--

1272
01:29:19,688 --> 01:29:21,023
Ducks fly together.

1273
01:29:22,107 --> 01:29:23,650
Now, new Ducks...

1274
01:29:24,109 --> 01:29:27,321
and old Ducks must unite
under a new banner.

1275
01:29:27,863 --> 01:29:30,908
And I thought perhaps
something like this.

1276
01:29:40,167 --> 01:29:43,462
<i>Here to start the third period,
what team is this?</i>

1277
01:29:43,796 --> 01:29:46,673
<i>It's not Team U.S.A.
Yes, it is.</i>

1278
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:48,550
<i>They've got on new uniforms.</i>

1279
01:29:48,634 --> 01:29:50,803
<i>They're wearing the logo of the duck.</i>

1280
01:29:50,886 --> 01:29:52,679
<i>I've never seen this before.</i>

1281
01:29:52,763 --> 01:29:54,098
Yeah! Come on!

1282
01:29:56,225 --> 01:30:00,104
<i>I've just gotten word that there
is no rule against changing uniforms.</i>

1283
01:30:00,312 --> 01:30:02,106
Come on. This is ridiculous.

1284
01:30:02,189 --> 01:30:04,691
<i>Well, Gordon Bombay's old
team was called the "Ducks"</i>

1285
01:30:04,858 --> 01:30:07,861
<i>and I guess we've got
the U.S.A. Ducks out there now.</i>

1286
01:30:09,613 --> 01:30:12,991
Quack! Quack! Quack!

1287
01:30:23,127 --> 01:30:26,004
Go... Ducks!

1288
01:30:34,680 --> 01:30:38,267
<i>We will, We will quack you</i>

1289
01:30:40,769 --> 01:30:44,356
<i>We will, We will quack you</i>

1290
01:30:47,067 --> 01:30:50,279
<i>We will, We will quack you</i>

1291
01:30:52,531 --> 01:30:55,159
<i>We will, We will quack you</i>

1292
01:30:55,284 --> 01:30:57,661
<i>Buddy, you're a boy
make a big noise</i>

1293
01:30:57,744 --> 01:31:00,581
<i>Playin' in the street
Gonna be a big man someday</i>

1294
01:31:00,664 --> 01:31:03,876
<i>You got mud on your face
You big disgrace</i>

1295
01:31:03,959 --> 01:31:06,587
<i>Kickin' your can
all over the place</i>

1296
01:31:06,670 --> 01:31:10,883
<i>Singin' We will
We will rock you</i>

1297
01:31:11,884 --> 01:31:14,386
<i>Germaine gives it to Wu.
Wu back to Germaine.</i>

1298
01:31:14,470 --> 01:31:17,556
<i>Germaine slides it to Connie Moreau.
She shoots. She scores!</i>

1299
01:31:19,975 --> 01:31:23,103
<i>Connie Moreau with a lovely move
in front of the net...</i>

1300
01:31:23,187 --> 01:31:26,023
<i>pulls Team U.S.A.
to within two goals.</i>

1301
01:31:26,982 --> 01:31:30,736
Yes! Yes. All right, you guys!
Way to go! All right, Ducks!

1302
01:31:32,696 --> 01:31:36,200
<i>Team U.S.A. still down
by two goals. Trying to get back in it.</i>

1303
01:31:36,283 --> 01:31:39,995
<i>- Shot and a diving save by Goldberg.</i>
- Watch your back!

1304
01:31:40,078 --> 01:31:42,956
<i>Averman with it, leads the attack.
Comes right up the middle.</i>

1305
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:45,834
<i>Averman lost the puck.
Iceland gets it over Gunnar Stahl.</i>

1306
01:31:45,918 --> 01:31:47,669
<i>He's got an open net. He scores!</i>

1307
01:31:47,794 --> 01:31:49,379
- Yes!
<i>- Oh, that hurts.</i>

1308
01:31:49,463 --> 01:31:52,341
<i>The Ducks trail now, five-to-two.</i>

1309
01:31:53,258 --> 01:31:54,676
Okay, Ducks, take a look here.

1310
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:57,221
Charlie, what are we doing here?
This isn't the NBA.

1311
01:31:57,304 --> 01:31:58,972
But it's the perfect teamwork play.

1312
01:32:10,150 --> 01:32:11,777
Now, cowboy!

1313
01:32:11,944 --> 01:32:13,445
Alley-oop, boys.

1314
01:32:24,748 --> 01:32:27,459
Yeah!

1315
01:32:30,754 --> 01:32:33,757
All right!

1316
01:32:33,882 --> 01:32:36,635
Yeah! Wooo! All right!

1317
01:32:37,553 --> 01:32:39,346
That's the way, Dwayne!

1318
01:32:39,972 --> 01:32:42,349
<i>Play continues here
in the final period.</i>

1319
01:32:42,432 --> 01:32:45,435
<i>The hitting has picked up,
but the Ducks are hanging in there.</i>

1320
01:32:45,519 --> 01:32:48,855
<i>However, they're still down
by two goals with time running out.</i>

1321
01:32:48,981 --> 01:32:52,442
<i>Bodies flying all over the ice.
The puck is in the Ducks' zone.</i>

1322
01:32:52,526 --> 01:32:55,487
<i>Here's Mendoza on a breakaway.
He can really fly.</i>

1323
01:32:55,571 --> 01:32:57,781
<i>The speedster
into the Iceland zone.</i>

1324
01:33:03,370 --> 01:33:05,330
- I stopped.
- Put it in, Luis!

1325
01:33:05,789 --> 01:33:07,666
<i>He scores!</i>

1326
01:33:08,125 --> 01:33:10,460
<i>- Luis Mendoza on a breakaway...</i>
- Yeah!

1327
01:33:10,544 --> 01:33:13,046
<i>scores with two minutes left.</i>

1328
01:33:13,171 --> 01:33:14,965
<i>And the Ducks trail by one.</i>

1329
01:33:18,343 --> 01:33:20,304
It's five-four. We are still in this.

1330
01:33:20,429 --> 01:33:22,139
Come on, we can do it!

1331
01:33:22,222 --> 01:33:24,224
- Russ.
- Yeah, Coach.

1332
01:33:24,641 --> 01:33:26,810
Two minutes left.
Can you get your shot off?

1333
01:33:26,935 --> 01:33:28,729
I don't know.
They're gunning for me.

1334
01:33:28,812 --> 01:33:29,855
Make it happen.

1335
01:33:40,991 --> 01:33:44,036
Get off me, man. Get off me!

1336
01:33:44,119 --> 01:33:46,079
Time out. Time out. Time out!

1337
01:33:46,163 --> 01:33:47,539
Guys, come in. Come on!

1338
01:33:48,874 --> 01:33:49,875
Goldberg!

1339
01:33:51,209 --> 01:33:53,670
Huddle up! Listen up!
This is what I wanna do.

1340
01:33:54,838 --> 01:33:58,216
When 56, Tyler's on the ice,
he's covered with three men.

1341
01:33:58,300 --> 01:33:59,593
Do you understand that?

1342
01:33:59,676 --> 01:34:01,094
- Ya.
- Okay. Go!

1343
01:34:02,471 --> 01:34:05,057
<i>Go... Ducks!</i>

1344
01:34:05,140 --> 01:34:07,726
Let's go!

1345
01:34:07,934 --> 01:34:10,354
<i>Time running out here
in the third period.</i>

1346
01:34:10,437 --> 01:34:13,065
<i>The Ducks with the puck.
They're still down by a goal.</i>

1347
01:34:13,148 --> 01:34:14,733
<i>They're back in their own zone.</i>

1348
01:34:14,816 --> 01:34:17,653
<i>I don't know why they're not
moving it up to center ice.</i>

1349
01:34:17,736 --> 01:34:20,072
<i>They have to attack.
The clock is ticking.</i>

1350
01:34:20,197 --> 01:34:22,741
<i>- Iceland with a one goal lead.</i>
- All right! Guy, now!

1351
01:34:23,992 --> 01:34:27,746
<i>Here's Germaine in his own zone.
Germaine gives it to Luis Mendoza.</i>

1352
01:34:27,871 --> 01:34:31,375
<i>Mendoza goes behind the net.
Starts up on the attack.</i>

1353
01:34:31,458 --> 01:34:34,586
<i>Mendoza drops it back
to-- to Goldberg?</i>

1354
01:34:34,711 --> 01:34:38,173
<i>He gave it to the goaltender Goldberg.
Wait, it's not Goldberg.</i>

1355
01:34:38,340 --> 01:34:39,257
It's Russ.

1356
01:34:39,341 --> 01:34:40,759
- Here, take it.
- Thanks.

1357
01:34:41,176 --> 01:34:42,469
The goalie!

1358
01:34:45,430 --> 01:34:47,766
<i>Tyler with it.
Tees up the puck.</i>

1359
01:34:47,974 --> 01:34:50,394
- No!
<i>- With the knucklepuck.</i>

1360
01:34:54,189 --> 01:34:56,608
<i>- Russ Tyler with the knucklepuck</i>
- Yeah!

1361
01:34:56,692 --> 01:35:00,237
<i>ties the game with no time left
on the clock.</i>

1362
01:35:06,159 --> 01:35:08,829
- Yeah!
- That's my boy! That's my boy!

1363
01:35:13,166 --> 01:35:14,960
Yeah!

1364
01:35:20,674 --> 01:35:23,760
<i>So the championship
comes down to a shootout.</i>

1365
01:35:23,844 --> 01:35:27,597
<i>Each team picks five of their best.
One-on-one with the goalie.</i>

1366
01:35:27,681 --> 01:35:31,226
<i>No rebounds.
Best of five shots wins it all.</i>

1367
01:35:31,393 --> 01:35:33,145
<i>What a way to end it!</i>

1368
01:35:58,670 --> 01:36:01,256
Yeah!

1369
01:36:29,743 --> 01:36:31,703
All right!

1370
01:36:49,930 --> 01:36:51,306
Yeah!

1371
01:38:04,212 --> 01:38:06,256
- Yes!
- Oh, yes!

1372
01:38:11,469 --> 01:38:14,681
Gunnar, you can do it.
Come on.

1373
01:38:14,848 --> 01:38:16,057
Go.

1374
01:38:20,186 --> 01:38:24,357
Julie, you got the fast glove.
I know this kid's move.

1375
01:38:24,566 --> 01:38:27,819
Triple deke, glove side.
Anticipate it and you got him.

1376
01:38:27,944 --> 01:38:30,530
- What if he goes stick side?
- He's fancy. He'll go glove.

1377
01:38:31,615 --> 01:38:33,241
Don't hesitate.
Let's go.

1378
01:38:33,408 --> 01:38:36,161
<i>In a surprise move,
Bombay has gone to his bench.</i>

1379
01:38:36,328 --> 01:38:39,247
<i>He's sending out Julie Gaffney
to replace Goldberg.</i>

1380
01:38:39,331 --> 01:38:41,625
<i>- She'll face Gunnar Stahl.</i>
- Go get him, Julie.

1381
01:38:43,043 --> 01:38:45,420
<i>I don't know
about this move by Bombay.</i>

1382
01:38:45,545 --> 01:38:49,466
<i>Putting in a cold goaltender to face
the leading scorer in the tournament.</i>

1383
01:38:49,591 --> 01:38:53,219
<i>But hang on to your hats. Here we go.</i>

1384
01:38:53,303 --> 01:38:56,139
<i>If Julie "The Cat" Gaffney
stops Gunnar Stahl,</i>

1385
01:38:56,222 --> 01:38:58,099
<i>the U.S.A. wins.</i>

1386
01:38:59,017 --> 01:39:00,393
That's one.

1387
01:39:01,478 --> 01:39:02,562
Two.

1388
01:39:03,271 --> 01:39:04,606
Three.

1389
01:39:28,213 --> 01:39:31,591
<i>Ducks win! Ducks win!
Oh, I can't believe it!</i>

1390
01:39:31,675 --> 01:39:33,343
<i>- The Ducks have come...</i>
- Yes! Yes!

1391
01:39:33,426 --> 01:39:35,470
<i>- from behind to beat Iceland...</i>
- Yes! Yes!

1392
01:39:35,553 --> 01:39:37,889
<i>in a shootout
in the championship game!</i>

1393
01:39:39,683 --> 01:39:40,934
Nice try.

1394
01:39:41,726 --> 01:39:46,147
<i>Bombay, the Minnesota
Miracle Man, has done it again.</i>

1395
01:40:16,219 --> 01:40:17,345
Gunnar.

1396
01:40:20,265 --> 01:40:21,766
You lost it for me.

1397
01:40:22,684 --> 01:40:24,227
You lost it
for yourself.

1398
01:40:28,314 --> 01:40:30,066
<i>Let's go shake their hands.</i>

1399
01:40:34,154 --> 01:40:35,822
- Good game.
- Good game.

1400
01:40:35,947 --> 01:40:37,866
- Good game.
- Good game, guys.

1401
01:40:40,201 --> 01:40:41,870
Good work, Captain Duck.

1402
01:40:42,370 --> 01:40:43,705
Thanks, Gunnar.

1403
01:40:49,711 --> 01:40:52,422
- Good job, Coach.
- Thanks, Wolf.

1404
01:40:52,881 --> 01:40:54,257
We'll see ya again.

1405
01:40:55,508 --> 01:40:59,804
U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!

1406
01:41:42,472 --> 01:41:46,351
Ducks! Ducks! Ducks!

1407
01:41:49,479 --> 01:41:52,148
Come on, Ducks!
We're goin' home.

1408
01:42:10,917 --> 01:42:14,129
- Whoa! Help me!
- You're not supposed to light it on fire.

1409
01:42:16,840 --> 01:42:19,509
<i>I've paid my dues</i>

1410

1412
01:42:27,684 --> 01:42:30,770

1413
01:42:32,063 --> 01:42:34,649
<i>And bad mistakes</i>

1414
01:42:35,650 --> 01:42:38,528
<i>I've made a few</i>

1415
01:42:39,696 --> 01:42:43,241
<i>I've had my share of sand
kicked in my face</i>

1416
01:42:43,324 --> 01:42:46,369
<i>But I've come through</i>

1417
01:42:46,452 --> 01:42:50,123

1418
