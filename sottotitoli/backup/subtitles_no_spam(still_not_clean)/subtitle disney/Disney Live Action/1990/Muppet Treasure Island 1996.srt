1
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,431
I was Flint's first mate
that voyage...

2
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,592
three days east of Tortola
in the Caribie.

3
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,035
Flint knew an island.

4
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,111
That's where we buried
the treasure.

5
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,273
Gold and blood,
they were Flint's trademarks.

6
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,238
He'd leave both
behind him that day.

7
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,995
<i>Shiver my timbers</i>
<i>Shiver my soul</i>

8
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,117
<i>Yo ho, heave ho</i>

9
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,352
<i>There are men whose hearts</i>
<i>are as black as coal</i>

10
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,908
<i>Yo ho, heave ho</i>

11
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,549
<i>And they sailed their ship</i>
<i>'cross the ocean blue</i>

12
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,632
<i>A bloodthirsty captain</i>
<i>and a cutthroat crew</i>

13
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,315
<i>It's as dark a tale</i>
<i>as was ever told</i>

14
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:09,520
<i>Of the lust for treasure</i>
<i>and the love of gold</i>

15
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,832
<i>Shiver my timbers</i>
<i>Shiver my sides</i>

16
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,275
<i>Yo ho, heave ho</i>

17
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,989
<i>There are hungers as strong</i>
<i>as the winds and tides</i>

18
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,878
<i>Yo ho, heave ho</i>

19
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:26,714
<i>And those buccaneers</i>
<i>drown their sins in rum</i>

20
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,076
<i>The devil himself would</i>
<i>have to call them scum</i>

21
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,596
<i>Every man aboard would have</i>
<i>killed his mate</i>

22
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,229
<i>For a bag of guineas</i>
<i>or a piece of eight</i>

23
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,151
<i>A piece of eight</i>

24
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,710
<i>-A piece of eight</i>
<i>-A five, six, seven, eight</i>

25
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,598
<i>Hulla wacka, ulla wacka</i>
<i>Something not right</i>

26
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,434
<i>Many wicked icky things</i>
<i>gonna happen tonight</i>

27
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,988
<i>Hulla wacka, moolah wacka</i>
<i>Sailor man beware</i>

28
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,073
<i>When de money in de ground</i>
<i>Dere's murder in de air</i>

29
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,991
<i>Murder in the air</i>

30
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,832
One more time now.

31
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,878
<i>Shiver my timbers</i>
<i>Shiver my bones</i>

32
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,236
<i>Yo ho, heave ho</i>

33
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,632
<i>There are secrets that sleep</i>
<i>with old Davy Jones</i>

34
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,950
<i>Yo ho, heave ho</i>

35
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,316
<i>When the mainsail's set</i>
<i>and the anchor's weighed</i>

36
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,995
<i>There's no turning back</i>
<i>from any course that's laid</i>

37
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,675
<i>And when greed and villainy</i>
<i>sail the sea</i>

38
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,959
<i>You can bet your boots</i>
<i>there'll be treachery</i>

39
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,950
<i>Shiver my timbers</i>
<i>Shiver my sails</i>

40
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,429
<i>Dead men tell no tales</i>

41
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,434
Oh, aye. Fifteen men
went ashore that day...

42
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,308
and only Flint, his own self,
returned.

43
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,155
Oh, aye, and then old Flinty...

44
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:00,313
up and died afore they could get
back to that cursed island...

45
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,630
and dig up the treasure.

46
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,191
No one knows to this day
who has old Flint's map.

47
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,556
Now, isn't that a story
worth the hearing?

48
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,279
It was the first dozen
times we heard it.

49
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,999
I'll drink to that.

50
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,038
But who has
the map now, huh?

51
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,829
Some black-hearted,
squid-suckin' buccaneer?

52
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:26,549
Or maybe it's
our very own Jim Hawkins.

53
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,471
Eh,Jimmy?

54
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,518
If I had it, my friends and I wouldn't
be here serving you rum, Mr Bones.

55
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,989
That's right. We'd be out
searching for that treasure...

56
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,913
sailing the seven seas
on a five-year mission...

57
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,072
boldly going where no man
has gone before.

58
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,390
- Say, that's catchy.
- Huh. Not me.

59
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,473
If I had that treasure map,
I'd be tradin' it for a decent meal.

60
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,790
Hey, Gonzo, you think
he's gonna eat this?

61
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,953
Aye! Beware the one-legged man!
He's the one to fear!

62
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,712
Don't worry, Captain.
We'll watch for him.

63
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,519
Yeah, I'll watch for him,
if he's deliverin' a pizza.

64
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,271
Even old Flinty
feared him.

65
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,114
If he comes pokin' 'round here,
you run for me whippety-quick!

66
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,760
- If we see him, we'll tell you.
- Yeah. One leg, three heads...

67
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,671
couple of dozen noses--
if anything weird happens--

68
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,797
And it'll be nay
jokin' matter, hose nose.

69
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,838
The one-legged man
brings death.

70
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,229
Time, gentlemen!

71
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,151
It's closing time!

72
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,390
Ya pays your bills,
and then ya shove off.

73
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,436
Go on. Out ya go!

74
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,189
Oh, you're drunk again,
are ya?

75
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,158
Boys, look at the state
of this place!

76
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,549
How comes it gets to be
such a pigsty, huh?

77
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,471
Pigsty? Hey!

78
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,710
No offence meant, gentlemen, sirs.
No offence meant.

79
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,030
- Here's to you, boys!
- Time!

80
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,190
- I'm away to my room.
- Thank you, Mr Bones.

81
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,633
- Thank you, Bill.
- There you go!

82
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,632
Don't forget to come back tomorrow
for our lunchtime special:

83
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,597
- roast suckling--
- Huh?

84
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,274
- Potatoes, sir. Potatoes.
- All right.

85
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,193
No-- No offence, madam.
No offence.

86
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,670
All right, boys.

87
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,320
When you're finished here,
you can go and clean up in the kitchen.

88
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,119
I left some table scraps
in there for your supper.

89
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,760
Oh, yes, and, boys...

90
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,400
last night you forgot
to put out the lantern!

91
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:15,190
If you forget that again,
there'll be no table scraps for a week!

92
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,869
You're standing on my ear.

93
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,951
Easy. Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Easy, Rizzo!

94
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,952
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
That's it. Steady.

95
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,032
- I hate my life.
- I hate your life too.

96
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,954
- If I had a life, I'd hate it.
- I should just run off to sea

97
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,635
He was my age when he sailed
to China as a cabin boy

98
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,631
Run off to sea
and just leave everybody?

99
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,359
Who's everybody?
I'm an orphan. I've got no family.

100
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,557
- Hey, you got us!
- Yeah, we're family. Got it.

101
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,798
I mean, some family we are. Be serious,
Rizzo. We don't exactly look alike.

102
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:56,954
Okay, all right. So I'm a rat and you're
a human being and Gonzo's a, uh--

103
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,508
- Whatever.
- Yeah. We're still family.

104
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,353
- Yeah.
- But I wish my life were more like...

105
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,158
one of Captain Bones'
adventures...

106
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,708
sailing the high seas and
searching for buried treasure.

107
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,679
Yeah, discovering lost islands
and weird civilizations.

108
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,911
Navigating with my father's old compass
to wherever the wind may take us.

109
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,436
- Off to Zanzibar
to meet the Zanzibarbarians.

110
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,590
To the southwest,
pirate galleons!

111
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,877
To the southeast, multi-armed
Zanzibanian shark women...

112
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,951
and their exploding wigs
of death!

113
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,679
To the northwest,
dirty dishes!

114
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,591
How does she do that?

115
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,717
- Might as well start. I'll wash.
- Oh, yeah. I'll dry.

116
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,597
I'll break.

117
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,910
<i>I look around here</i>
<i>and I want to cry</i>

118
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,831
Me too. Yeah.

119
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,992
<i>I feel like the world</i>
<i>is passing me by</i>

120
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,433
It is.

121
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,954
<i>And I just can't</i>
<i>help but wonder</i>

122
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,429
<i>Am I doomed to wash and dry</i>

123
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,719
<i>And is it a curse I'm under</i>
<i>to do it till I die</i>

124
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,268
- Oh, I hope not.
- Yeah.

125
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,749
<i>- When I could be an explorer</i>
- Sure ya could.

126
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,990
<i>- Sailing off to distant lands</i>
- Not so fast.

127
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,911
<i>Instead of spending</i>
<i>every afternoon</i>

128
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,070
<i>Just getting dishpan hands</i>

129
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,392
<i>My future looks like nowhere</i>
<i>that I want to be</i>

130
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,517
<i>There's gotta be</i>
<i>something better</i>

131
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,033
<i>Something better</i>

132
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,193
<i>There's gotta be something</i>
<i>better than this for me</i>

133
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,918
Well, now you're talkin'.

134
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,073
<i>If it's weird and wild</i>
<i>let's go and find it</i>

135
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,913
<i>The crazier, the better</i>
<i>is what I say</i>

136
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,399
Yeah, that's true.

137
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,517
<i>To tell the truth</i>
<i>I really wouldn't mind it</i>

138
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,510
Mind what?

139
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:42,674
<i>If we found someplace</i>
<i>with ten square meals a day</i>

140
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,591
<i>Let danger call my name</i>

141
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,114
<i>If it does</i>
<i>I'm gonna hide</i>

142
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,158
<i>I'll put my courage</i>
<i>to the test</i>

143
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,310
<i>And I'll be</i>
<i>by your side</i>

144
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,391
<i>He'll be by your side</i>

145
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,554
<i>There's gotta be</i>
<i>something better than this</i>

146
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,155
<i>- Something more than this</i>
<i>- I know that there's so much out there</i>

147
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,073
<i>- To see</i>
<i>- To see</i>

148
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,310
<i>And I know</i>
<i>this life I'm living</i>

149
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,393
<i>Can't be my destiny</i>

150
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,109
<i>There's gotta be</i>
<i>something better</i>

151
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,918
<i>Something better</i>

152
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,709
<i>There's gotta be something</i>
<i>better than this for me</i>

153
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,190
- And me!
- Wait a minute. What about me?

154
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:30,070
<i>There's something better</i>
<i>than this for you and</i>

155
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:40,400
<i>Me</i>

156
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,596
Enough of this singin'!

157
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,433
Rum! I need rum, lads!

158
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,830
I got the horrors!
Give me rum!

159
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,558
Rum till I float!

160
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,757
All right! All right!
Just one small one.

161
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,479
Don't be giving him
any more rum!

162
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,916
How does she blooming do that?

163
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,274
Shh! Shh!

164
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:29,118
Billy Bones!
It's me, Blind Pew.

165
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,590
I know you're here, Billy.

166
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,353
Ya snivelling coward!

167
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,318
It's some kind
of a blind fiend.

168
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,311
I believe they prefer
''visually challenged fiend.''

169
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:45,190
Ah, I heard that!
There's someone here!

170
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,510
Uh, no. Over here!

171
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,231
Hmm, over here.

172
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:00,075
Billy Bones! Ah,
I'd know that scurvy mug...

173
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,197
of yours anywhere.

174
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,191
Excuse me, sir,
but the bar is closed.

175
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:11,199
Aha. A pretty
little girl, is it?

176
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:15,193
Yes. Take me
to Billy Bones, my pet.

177
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,952
Y-You've come
to the wrong place.

178
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,918
Th-There's no Billy Bones here,
and I'm not a girl.

179
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,120
Oh, I may be visually challenged,
but I can see you're lying.

180
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,952
Huh?

181
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,192
Good evening, Bill.
I know it's you.

182
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:37,831
Yes. You thought you could
get away with it, didn't you?

183
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,434
Just take it all
for yourself...

184
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:44,718
and leave your shipmates
with nothing.

185
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,429
We're not pleased with that,
Bill. Not at all.

186
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:52,798
We want you to have this!

187
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,150
Watch where you're going,
you stupid cat!

188
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,309
The Black Spot!

189
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,758
But I don't understand.
What is the Black Spot?

190
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,400
The Black Spot's
a pirate's death sentence!

191
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,473
- Fabulous.
- They'll be comin' to kill me tonight!

192
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,391
- We'd better help.
- Yeah, yeah, let's get some stuff.

193
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,916
- It's my sea chest them lubbers want.
- Underwear.

194
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,913
But I'll trick them! I'll shake out
another reef and daddle 'em again!

195
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,197
You wanna run that by us again
in English, Mr Bones?

196
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,589
It's mine! I'm goin'
for that treasure myself!

197
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,990
And no one-legged
son of a bilge rat will--

198
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,869
Captain Bones!

199
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:13,070
He died? And this is supposed
to be a kids' movie.

200
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,232
Jimmy.Jim.
Jimmy,Jim,Jim,Jim,Jim.

201
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,198
You always been a decent sort
to old Billy Bones.

202
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,589
But I'm not Jimmy,Jim,Jimmy,
Jim,Jim,Jim,Jim.

203
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,319
He's Jimmy,Jim,Jimmy,
Jim,Jim,Jim,Jim.

204
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,833
-Jim!
- Yes, Captain.

205
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,229
Jim,Jimmy,Jimmy,Jim,
Jim,Jim,Jim.

206
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,550
- Yes, Captain. What is it?
- Take the map!

207
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,949
- What map?
- The map to old Flint's treasure!

208
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,871
Don't ya understand
what I been tellin' ya?

209
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:38,236
I was Flinty's first mate!
We all were! Blind Pew and me!

210
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,311
Me own shipmates,
they'll gully me for sure!

211
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,356
And anybody else to get
their mitts on that map!

212
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,476
A-And gullying hurts, right?

213
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,516
Oh, aye! A lot!

214
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,433
- So quick.
- Go to my sea chest! Get the map!

215
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,397
Oh, yeah.

216
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,439
- Oh, there. There.
- Oh, I think I've-- Oh, no.

217
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,478
- Hey, guys, look!
- Rizzo!

218
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,391
Oh, here!
How about this?

219
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,391
Let's see.

220
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,795
Hey, Rizzo, look.

221
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,956
- It is a treasure map.
- We're gonna be rich.

222
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,871
- We're gonna be dead.
- Beware, lads!

223
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,951
Beware!

224
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,508
- What? The one-legged man?
- Aye! But also...

225
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,912
beware runnin' with scissors
or any other pointy objects.

226
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,630
It's all good fun till
somebody loses an--

227
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,671
Captain?

228
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:40,317
We're standing in a room
with a dead guy!

229
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,631
Jim!

230
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,556
Oh, Billy Bones!
Trick or treat!

231
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,989
Don't try to hide, Billy!
You know what we want!

232
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:17,199
Where are ya, Billy Bones?
Where are ya, Billy?

233
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,632
Mrs Bluveridge!

234
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,554
There's no use in hiding!

235
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,279
Can't a woman get her
beauty sleep any more?

236
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,709
Jim, what you doing?

237
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,875
Aha! Aha!

238
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,793
Oh! Voila!

239
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,510
- Okay, okay. I found the gun.
- Oh, now we gotta load it.

240
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,068
- Okay.
- Oops.

241
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,229
Okay, where does Mrs Bluveridge
keep the bullets?

242
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,552
Billy's dead, and he hasn't
got the blooming map!

243
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,108
- Those little girls must have it.
- Yeah!

244
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,031
- Get them!
- Yeah!

245
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,951
- Gonzo! Gonzo!
- What? What?

246
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,918
I found the bullets. See?
Here they are. They--

247
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,911
Oops.

248
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,639
Open up in there!
We wants the map...

249
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,598
and we'll skewer anybody
who gets in the way!

250
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,353
Quick,Jim! The back stairs!

251
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,271
Come on.

252
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,918
Run! Run!

253
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,592
Get out of my inn,
you tattooed miseries!

254
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,989
Can't a woman
get a night's sleep alone?

255
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,036
You come here, you!

256
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,998
This gun is useless!

257
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:42,198
- You lost all the bullets!
- Well, you're losin' the powder.

258
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,794
The map!
Tell us where it is or die!

259
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,791
- Get them!
- Run! Run, run, run!

260
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,157
Hurry! Hurry!

261
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,356
Hurry!

262
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,756
Outta the way! Outta the way!
Get outta the way!

263
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,999
Stop!

264
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,638
Oh, Woof.

265
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,948
Geronimo!

266
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,109
Guys!

267
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,838
Wow! What an exit!

268
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,751
- Right through a brick wall!
- I am in such pain.

269
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,876
Come on!

270
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,829
I think I smell
something burning, no?

271
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,036
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?

272
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,754
We can't go home, so--

273
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,869
Oh, no. Uh-uh. No way. You're not
taking me on some crazy treasure hunt.

274
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,679
- I am staying right here!
- Oh, good idea, Rizzo.

275
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,638
Then you can see what half-burned,
vicious pirates look like.

276
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,280
What are we waitin' for?
Gimme that map. Come on. Let's go.

277
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,079
Wait a minute.
What about Mrs Bluveridge?

278
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,555
I'll be fine, boys!
Run for it!

279
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,549
How does she do that?

280
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,071
Who's gonna clean
all this up?

281
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,790
Two for a penny, sir?

282
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,317
- I don't want a baked potato.
- Lovely hot baked potatoes.

283
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,397
- Oh, let's see.
- What a night.

284
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,550
- There it is!
- Huh? Oh.

285
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,753
''Trelawny & Son
Master Ship Builders''

286
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,595
Whoa, whoa!
Reality check here, guys!

287
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,671
Do we actually believe some
bozo's gonna give us a ship...

288
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,591
just because we show him
Captain Bones' map?

289
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:50,834
- It's worth a try, Rizzo.
- I don't know.

290
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,478
May I help you?

291
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:56,997
Yes. Thank you. We wish to speak
with Squire Trelawney, the shipbuilder.

292
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,036
- We need a ship.
- Ah, I'm sorry.

293
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,317
The squire's in Long Neddry
for the grouse season.

294
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,393
He will return
on the feast of St Lulu.

295
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,431
- Thank you.
- That's that.

296
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,431
Of course, his rich...

297
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,230
half-wit son
young Squire Trelawney's here.

298
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,788
We'll see him, then.

299
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,872
Well, gentlemen...

300
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,748
this is definitely a genuine,
bona fide treasure map.

301
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:27,990
Really!

302
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,752
Yes. Mr Bimbo told me so.

303
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:36,396
Oh, Mr Bimbo lives in my finger.
He's very smart. He's been to the moon.

304
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,873
Thank you. Twice.

305
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,350
- I smell a bozo.
- Mm-hmm.

306
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,275
Well done, Beakie.

307
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,920
Now we know that is definitely
too much gunpowder.

308
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:59,029
Beaker, stop fooling around.
We've got company.

309
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,753
Oh, hello, chappies. Everyone, this is
Dr Livesey and his assistant, Beaker.

310
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,149
They do research
and development for my papa.

311
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,593
Hello.

312
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,830
Actually, Squire, we were
hoping to meet your father.

313
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:16,152
- We need a ship for an ocean voyage.
- Ocean? Ocean.

314
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,189
- Ocean?
- You know, the ocean?

315
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,795
Oh! Th-The big,
blue, wet thing! Yes!

316
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,030
Say, I know
what's happening here.

317
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,396
You chaps are planning
to sail to this island, aren't you?

318
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,438
- To dig up this treasure.
- Yes, but we must be quiet about it.

319
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,159
- There are pirates
looking for this map.

320
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,470
Isn't that exciting?

321
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,677
Pirates, eh?
Well, that settles it.

322
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,591
We'll use one
of my daddy's boats...

323
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:49,673
and I will personally finance
the voyage for the treasure myself.

324
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:54,709
- You'll do that? Really?
- What are rich, half-wit sons for?

325
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,869
Well, here's the dock.
Jim, where's our boat?

326
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,951
We're on a dock?
No wonder I'm seasick.

327
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,679
- Ahoy!
- Ah, morning, Squire.

328
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,196
Welcome. Welcome.
Ah, there she is:

329
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,236
the <i>Hispaniola</i>.

330
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,151
Wow!

331
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:22,076
- Come on. Let's go!
- Yeah, let's go.

332
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,558
- ''Take a cruise,'' you said.
- Huh?

333
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,108
- ''See the world,'' you said.
- Huh?

334
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,034
Now here we are stuck
on the front of this stupid ship.

335
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,908
Well, it could be worse.
We could be stuck in the audience.

336
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,913
Well, Mr Bimbo...

337
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,150
the ship is provisioned,
the crew is in place...

338
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,879
and the captain should be
on board within the hour.

339
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,871
You have been
a busy little man.

340
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,953
- Oh, look, there goes Jim.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

341
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,508
Ooh! Ooh, look!

342
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,511
It's the boat
steering thing.

343
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,511
This is called the helm.

344
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,513
Hey, how does it feel,
Captain Hawkins?

345
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,909
Feels like
we're really doing it.

346
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,958
It feels like we're finally
having an adventure!

347
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,679
Yeah. I'm starvin'.
Where's the kitchen?

348
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,038
<i>Heigh ho and up she rises</i>

349
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,237
- Something smells good.
<i>- Heigh ho and up she rises</i>

350
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,788
- Cool.
<i>- Heigh ho and up she rises</i>

351
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,475
<i>Early in the morning</i>

352
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:31,472
<i>Put him in the longboat</i>
<i>until he's sober</i>

353
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,677
<i>Put him in the longboat</i>
<i>till he's sober</i>

354
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,274
<i>Put him in the longboat</i>
<i>till he's sober</i>

355
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,191
<i>Early in the morning</i>

356
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,397
What have we here?
Stowaways!

357
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,712
I'm afraid we shish-kebab
and barbecue stowaways on this ship.

358
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,995
Wait. I know.
You must be the cabin boys.

359
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,117
- Yeah.
- Hungry, lads?

360
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,317
Well, in my galley, you're always
welcome to help yourselves!

361
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,709
Yes! Thank you!

362
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,992
Oh, yes!

363
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,152
Well, he's got a healthy appetite.
How about you, funny face?

364
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,071
- Huh?
- Here.

365
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,435
Hey. Thank you.

366
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,909
My name is Gonzo,
and the guy in your chicken is Rizzo.

367
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,112
- And you must be Master Hawkins.
- Yes, sir.

368
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,636
Oh, you needn't be callin'
a lowly ship's cook ''sir.''

369
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,679
Long John Silver,
at your humble service.

370
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,354
We're just cabin boys,
Mr Silver.

371
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,115
Long John to his friends.

372
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,792
And believe me, lad...

373
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,112
a friend you can trust
is worth his weight in gold.

374
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,751
There's many a dark-hearted
scoundrel in these ports.

375
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,831
Well, what do you mean?
Pirates?

376
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,354
- Shh!
- Pirates! That's rich!

377
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,273
Pirates? What an imagination.
Give me a cracker.

378
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,477
Allow me to introduce
my pet lobster Polly.

379
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,710
Pieces of eight!
Pieces of eight!

380
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,631
Raised him
from a fingerling, I did.

381
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,156
As fine a crustacean
as a man could ask for.

382
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,198
B-But I thought sailors
had talking parrots as pets.

383
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,430
Talking parrots?

384
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,752
What an imagination.
First pirates, now talking parrots?

385
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,753
What's next? A singing, dancing mouse
with his own amusement park?

386
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,876
That's enough now, Polly.
Go on! Shoo!

387
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,953
Right, me hearties. I'm gonna give you
a cook's tour of this fine ship.

388
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,395
If you're gonna be the cook
on this ship, Mr Silver...

389
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,835
I am definitely gonna need
bigger pants.

390
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,471
What's the matter, lads?

391
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,079
Oh, that?

392
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:58,359
Lost that timber-fighting brigands
off Madagascar under Admiral Hawke.

393
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:02,399
There's many a man lost a leg and worse
in the service of the king.

394
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:07,031
Why, look what a cannibal
took off me...

395
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,759
in exchange for me own life.

396
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,715
Oh, you're a fine pair, lads.
That you are.

397
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,917
Bright as buttons,
the lot of ye.

398
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,798
- All hands on deck!
- Come on, then, lads.

399
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,033
Chop-chop! Look lively now.
The captain will be here soon.

400
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,792
Chop-chop.

401
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,916
- Who's that?
- That is Mr Arrow, the first mate,

402
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,793
The captain approaches.

403
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,560
Move aside! Make way!
Make ready for the captain!

404
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,676
Lollygaggers will suffer
his wrath!

405
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,591
Wrath? I-Is this captain
bad-tempered?

406
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,593
Is he bad-tempered?
The man is a raging volcano...

407
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:04,434
tormented by inner demons the likes
of which mere mortals cannot fathom.

408
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,556
He's got demons? Cool!

409
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,831
Maniac!

410
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,029
Heigh-ho, everyone.

411
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,634
- What-- That--
- That's the raging volcano?

412
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,474
- He's a frog.
- Maybe he gets hopping mad.

413
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,471
Hopping mad.

414
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:06,590
Piping aboard
Captain Abraham Smollett.

415
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,351
Good day, Mr Arrow.

416
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,557
I knew it.
He's furious.

417
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,551
- Ah, you there!
- Me?

418
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,916
You were in charge of railing dust.
Thirty lashes, and then

419
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:27,879
- I didn't say that, Mr Arrow.
- I was anticipating your whim, sir.

420
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,997
Oh. You must be
the cabin boys.

421
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,230
- Yes, sir!
- Which one of you is Hawkins?

422
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,151
I am, sir.

423
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,390
I knew your father,Jim.
He was a good man.

424
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,948
Thank you, sir.

425
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:44,511
Well, this is shapin' up
to be a fine voyage, lads.

426
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,068
Oh, yes, indeed.

427
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,480
One leg,Jim.
Count 'em. One.

428
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:56,348
- Remember what Billy Bones said.
- Oh, Gonzo, he seems all right.

429
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,319
I mean, Long John's only a cook.
How dangerous could he be?

430
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,198
Well, I don't know, but I--
Wait a minute. Where's Rizzo?

431
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:06,238
Enjoy your cruise, sir.
Next!

432
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,869
All right, folks, have your cheques
made out to ''Rat Tours Limited.''

433
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,077
Remember, we put
the rat in ''pirate.''

434
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,431
Why, thank you,
Mr Plagueman. Next!

435
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,671
- Rizzo, what are you doing?
- What? Oh, this.

436
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,591
Well, I figure
if the treasure map's a dud...

437
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:25,639
the trip won't be a total loss,
financially speaking.

438
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:29,110
Well, the wind seems to be freshening.
The tide is with us.

439
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,033
Mr Arrow,
this voyage has begun.

440
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:36,318
This voyage has begun!
Raise the gangplank!

441
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,834
- Right, lads!
- Let go forward line!

442
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:42,390
Let go aft line.
Hard to starboard.

443
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,119
Any man caught dawdling
will be shot on sight.

444
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,156
- I didn't say that.
- I was just paraphrasing.

445
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:51,836
- Mr Arrow, just set the sails.
- Set the sails!

446
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,791
Hey, where's my camera?

447
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,395
- I'll miss you! I said I'll miss you!
- We'll send postcards!

448
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,675
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye!

449
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,480
<i>When the course is laid</i>
<i>and the anchor's weighed</i>

450
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:13,028
<i>A sailor's blood</i>
<i>begins racing</i>

451
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,953
<i>With our hearts unbound</i>
<i>and our flag unfurled</i>

452
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,793
<i>We're underway and off</i>
<i>to see the world</i>

453
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,269
<i>Underway and off</i>
<i>to see the world</i>

454
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,669
<i>Heave ho, we'll go</i>

455
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,558
<i>Anywhere the wind</i>
<i>is blowing</i>

456
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,235
<i>Manly men are we</i>

457
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,198
<i>Sailing for adventure</i>
<i>on the deep blue sea</i>

458
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:38,035
Safely now, Mr Silver. Let's not
get sloppy just because we're singing.

459
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:41,032
- Aye, aye, sir.
<i>- Danger walks on deck</i>

460
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,350
<i>We laugh at the perils</i>
<i>we're facing</i>

461
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,193
<i>Every storm we ride</i>
<i>is its own reward</i>

462
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,953
<i>And people die</i>

463
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,600
<i>People die</i>
<i>by falling overboard</i>

464
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,558
<i>Heigh ho, we'll go</i>

465
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,108
<i>Anywhere the wind</i>

466
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,113
<i>Hoist the sails and sing</i>

467
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,512
<i>Sailing for adventure</i>
<i>on the big, blue, wet thing</i>

468
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,275
<i>I love to see 'em cry</i>
<i>when they walk the plank</i>

469
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,194
<i>I prefer to cut a throat</i>

470
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,840
<i>I love to hang 'em high</i>
<i>and watch their little feet</i>

471
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:19,276
<i>Try to walk in the air</i>
<i>while their faces turn blue</i>

472
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,191
Just kidding.

473
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,350
<i>It's a good life on a boat</i>

474
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,000
<i>There are distant lands</i>
<i>with burning sands</i>

475
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,640
<i>That call across the oceans</i>

476
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,518
<i>There are bingo games</i>
<i>every fun-filled day</i>

477
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,239
<i>And margaritas</i>
<i>at the midnight buffet</i>

478
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,914
<i>Margaritas</i>

479

481
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,916
<i>Should have took a train</i>

483
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,109
<i>The salty breezes whisper</i>

00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,839
<i>Who knows what lies ahead</i>

485
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,480
<i>I just know</i>
<i>I was born to lead</i>

486
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:59,358
<i>The life my father led</i>

487
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,908
<i>The stars will be</i>

<i>Wherever we may roam</i>

489
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,119
<i>And our mates</i>
<i>will always be</i>

490
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,589
<i>Just like a family</i>

491
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,797
<i>And though we may</i>

492
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,917
<i>The sea is always home</i>

493
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,869
All right, Mr Bimbo. I didn't know
you had such a good singing voice.

494
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,474
<i>We'll chase our dreams</i>

495
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:26,393
<i>Over the horizon</i>

496
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,040

498
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:35,674
<i>Bold and brave and free</i>

499
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,069
<i>- Sailing for adventure</i>
- It's so nauseating!

500
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,799
<i>- Sailing for adventure</i>
- So exhilarating!

501
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,599
<i>- Sailing for adventure</i>
- We're all celebrating!

502
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:48,879
<i>On the deep blue sea</i>

503
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,834
Ahoy!

504
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,319
Roll call!

505
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,635
- Long John Silver?
- Aye, aye, sir!

506
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,154
- Short Stack Stevens?
- Aye!

507
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,992
- One-Eyed Jack?
- Aye!

508
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,150
- Black-Eyed Pea.
- Yeah.

509
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,037
- Walleyed Pike.
- Aye.

510
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,111
Polly Lobster.

511
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,509
- Mad Monty.
- Aye.

512
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,398
- Sweetums.
- Aye.

513
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,431
- Old Tom.
- Aye, aye.

514
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,794
- Real Old Tom.
- Aye.

515
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,838
- Dead Tom?
- Aye, aye.

516
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,992
Cool.

517
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,991
- Clueless Morgan?
- Huh?

518
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,071
Headless Bill.

519
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,628
Headless Bill.

520
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:45,432
Big-Fat-Ugly-Bug-Face-
Baby-Eating O'Brien?

521
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,873
Aye.

522
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,873
- Angel Marie.
- Aye, aye.

523
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,597
Gentlemen, may I see you
in my cabin?

524
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,750
- Immediately?
- Mm-hmm.

525
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,718
Who hired this crew? This is
undoubtedly the seediest bunch...

526
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,870
of cutthroats, villains
and scoundrels I have ever seen!

527
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,030
So who hired 'em?

528
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,871
Your finger hired the crew?

529
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:24,159
No, that's silly. The man who lives
in my finger hired the crew: Mr Bimbo.

530
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,196
What? Ah!

531
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:30,239
Yeah, he relied heavily on the advice
of our excellent cook, Long John Silver.

532
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:35,030
A cook? And a guy who lives
in a bear's finger?

533
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,997
Exactly!

534
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,871
I'm starting to worry
about this voyage.

535
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,713
Jim, I know Billy Bones
gave you the treasure map...

536
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,633
but I hope you'll give it
to me for safekeeping.

537
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,314
I'll be careful with it, sir.

538
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,516
Beggin' your pardon,
gentlemen...

539
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,955
but I've come with a bit
of a treat for you.

540
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:04,077
'Tis my very own best brandy...

541
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:07,311
laid down by the brothers
of Buckfast Abbey...

542
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,233
vintage 1 737...

543
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,232
to toast
to a prosperous voyage.

544
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:16,312
- Oh, spiffy.
- I'm sorry, Mr Silver, but I'm not...

545
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,039
going to allow drinking
on this voyage.

546
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:22,078
- Oh, well, rules are rules.
- Oh, but, sir...

547
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:25,436
'tis a tradition for the officers
to toast to the success of a voyage.

548
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,999
Ah, very true.

549
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,877
No, we must set an example
for this questionable crew.

550
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,997
There will be no consumption
of alcohol of any kind.

551
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:35,595
Oh, sir, but I can vouch
for this crew myself.

552
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:38,478
You could sail to heaven
and back with these men.

553
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,790
Well, I'm afraid
I must disagree with you.

554
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,393
Oh.

555
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,630
You wanna knock it off
with the booze?

556
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,188
It's peeling the paint
off of the shuffleboard court.

557
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,748
- Yeah.
- Sorry.

558
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,831
And that's that.
This conversation is finished.

559
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,956
I understand, sir.

560
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,952
I shall tend to my duty
and see to it...

561
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:01,113
that every drop of alcohol
is thrown overboard.

562
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,636
Come on,Jim.
Don't bother, Captain.

563
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,188
You can go
if you want to,Jim.

564
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,111
- Come on.
- Yeah.

565
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:13,271
Oh, well. I guess the human beings
wanna hang out together...

566
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,271
don't wanna spend time
with a rat and a, uh--

567
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,669
- Uh, uh, whatever.
- Yeah.

568
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,870
- Say cheese!
- Cheese!

569
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,110
Oh, that's great.

570
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,111
Cute couple.

571
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:44,232
Stop it!

572
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,709
I never felt
like this before.

573
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,631
- Denise, what I'm trying to say--
- Yes?

574
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,551
- What I'm trying to say is--
- Yes?

575
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,471
- What I mean to say is, I--
- Yes?

576
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,228
I'm sorry your present
didn't work out.

577
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,995
Oh,Jim, Smollett sails
by rules and laws.

578
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,719
That's what bein' a captain's
all about.

579
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,711
Me, I sails by the stars.

580
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,593
Stars?

581
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:18,355
North,Jim. Find me north out there
among them stars.

582
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,396
Well, that's easy.

583
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,391
Ah, yeah, but what
if you don't have a compass?

584
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,789
Long John, please don't drop it.
It was my father's.

585
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,711
It's all I have of his.
Please. Please.

586
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,830
I'm sorry, lad.
I were only foolin'.

587
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,714
- How old were you when he died, then?
- Seven.

588
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,519
I were eight
when my father died at sea.

589
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:50,071
- First mate, he was.
- My father was a first mate too.

590
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,515
Was he, now?

591
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,672
By the powers.
What a coincidence.

592
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:02,799
Now,Jim, that be Polaris,
the North Star.

593
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,395
Even in the China Sea,
that's north.

594
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,948
- North. Polaris.
- Uh-huh.

595
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,794
- So we must be heading southwest.
- Smart as paint you are, lad.

596
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,599
Smart as paint.

597
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,956
Now, that gets old Long John
to wonderin'.

598
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,990
Why would we be
sailin' southwest?

599
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,518
The scuttlebutt
among the crew is that, uh...

600
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,670
we're sailin'
for buried treasure...

601
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,877
and, uh, someone on board...

602
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,871
has a map.

603
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,278
'Course,
none of my concern,Jim.

604
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,669
I'm just a ship's cook.

605
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,673
Such matters are best suited
to Captain Smollett.

606
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,877
Come on, Long John.
You could captain this ship.

607
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,918
That I could, lad.

608
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,150
Maybe someday I will.

609
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,031
- Moonlight swim?
- Okay.

610
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,995
Oh, Smolly, my love for you...

611
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,640
is deeper than
the deep, blue sea.

612
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,839
Get on with you! Go on!

613
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,989
Hi,Jim!

614
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:18,358
- Yo,Jimbo! Mornin', Long--
- Hi, Long John. Good morning.

615
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,954
Well, at least one of us
is having a good time.

616
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,396
Ah, Rizzo, it's not so bad.
Angel Marie said that later on...

617
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,314
he'd throw a line out the back
and let me drag along the bottom.

618
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,949
I don't know about this crew.
I feel like they're always

619
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,235
That's just a figment
of your imagination.

620
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,790
This is a figment
of my imagination?

621
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,996
Now, tell us
where the map is...

622
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,355
or we'll tear ya
limb from limb!

623
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,715
Never. My friend
and I will never tell.

624
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,360
Hey, hey, there could be
extenuatin' circumstances.

625
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,715
I mean, you know--
Wh-- I b-- If--

626
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,677
Maybe they'll ask
real nice.

627
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,591
- In your dreams!
- Do it, Monty! Do it!

628
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,989
Yeah, do it to me!

629
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,751
Yes! More!

630
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,798
- Oh, no, I can't look.
- Look at this!

631
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,155
I'm taller!
This is so cool!

632
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:14,357
I may even have a future
with the NBA.

633
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:17,432
This won't work! He likes it!
Let's torture the rat!

634
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,511
- Huh? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
- Yeah!

635
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,433
- Oh, no, no!
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yes.

636
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,557
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
- Oh, please, no! I hate basketball!

637
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:29,918
I got a lovely recipe
for blackened rat.

638
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,834
I say!
This does not look safe!

639
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,398
- What? What? What? What?
- I b-- I burned my hand.

640
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,152
Kiss it or something!

641
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,518
Poodly, poodly, poodly,
poodly, poodly.

642
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,558
Mr Arrow, lock those three up
for the remainder of the voyage.

643
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,471
- Yes, sir!
- You can't hold us!

644
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,518
- To the brig! Move along!
- Will you stop crying!

645
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:03,639
- Move along.
- Oh, good. That's good. Yeah.

646
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:06,393
Master Hawkins, may I see you
in my cabin, please?

647
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,278
Yes, sir.

648
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,828
- Ready, Mr Gonzo?
- Ready!

649
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,911
Tie off the rope, Beaker!

650
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,516
We call this
the window shade cure.

651
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,909
All right.
Snip, snip, snip.

652
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,148
Oh, great! Wow!

653
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,029
That was so cool!

654
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,509
Hmm? Oh, sure.

655
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:42,238
- Who's the lady pig, sir?
- Never mind that,Jim. Listen.

656
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:45,756
I'm hoping you're willing
to give me the map now,

657
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,751
I'd rather not, sir.

658
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,511
I'd hoped it wouldn't
come to this,Jim, but...

659
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,591
as captain, I order you
to give me the map.

660
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:04,316
- Mr Arrow?
- Aye, aye, Captain.

661
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,436
Lock up this treasure map.

662
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,549
It will be safe
in here, sir.

663
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:50,112
It's been six weeks
since we left England.

664
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,474
Five days
since we had a breeze.

665
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,471
No!

666
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:07,073
I got the madness!

667
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,632
I got cabin fever!

668
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:12,439
I've got it too!

669
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:15,318
Cabin fever!

670
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:18,870
<i>I got cabin fever</i>
<i>It's burning in my brain</i>

671
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:22,589
<i>I got cabin fever</i>
<i>It's driving me insane</i>

672
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:26,355
<i>We got cabin fever</i>
<i>We're flipping our bandannas</i>

673
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:29,750
<i>Been stuck at sea so long</i>
<i>that we have simply gone bananas</i>

674
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,919
<i>We, we, we got cabin fever</i>

675
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,956
<i>We lost what sense we had</i>

676
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,350
<i>We got cabin fever</i>
<i>We're all going mad</i>

677
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:48,035
<i>Grab your partner by the ears</i>
<i>Lash him to the wheel</i>

678
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:51,351
<i>Do-si-do, step on his toe</i>
<i>Listen to him squeal</i>

679
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,476
<i>Allemande left</i>
<i>Allemande right</i>

680
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,630
<i>It's time to sail or sink</i>

681
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,631
<i>Swing your partner</i>
<i>over the side</i>

682
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:00,678
<i>- Drop him in the drink</i>
- We've got cabin fever.

683
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:03,513
- No ifs, ands or buts.
- We're disoriented.

684
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,955
- And demented.
- And a little nuts.

685
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,993
<i>Volkswagen car</i>

686
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,156
<i>We were sailing, sailing</i>

687
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,151
<i>The wind was on our side</i>

688
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,831
And then it died.

689
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:24,037
<i>I got cabin fever</i>
<i>I think I lost my grip</i>

690
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:28,159
<i>I'd like to get my hands</i>
<i>on whoever wrote this script</i>

691
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:33,473
<i>I was floating</i>
<i>'neath the tropic moon</i>

692
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:36,996
<i>And dreaming</i>
<i>of a blue lagoon</i>

693
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:40,356
<i>Now I'm as crazy as a loon</i>

694
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:44,115
<i>Cabin fever</i>
<i>has ravaged all aboard</i>

695
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:47,397
<i>This one small vessel</i>
<i>has become a floating psycho ward</i>

696
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:51,234
<i>We were sailing, sailing</i>
<i>heading who knows where</i>

697
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:54,118
<i>And now though</i>
<i>we're all here</i>

698
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:57,237
<i>We're not all there</i>

699
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,755
Cabin fever!

700
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:09,795
- The wind is back.
- What are we doing?

701
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:12,189
What's goin' on here?

702
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:14,589
- What was that?
- I feel like such a fool.

703
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:18,116
- Yeah, me too.
- I hope nobody saw that. Embarrassing.

704
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,111
- Get us outta here! Help!
- We didn't hit him!

705
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,760
Come on. Let us out.
We was only joking.

706
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:27,398
- Hey, Long John!
Hey, get us outta here!

707
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,311
- Hey-ey-ey, Polly.
- What?

708
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,676
- What was that song that just happened?
- What are you talkin' about?

709
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:35,832
You know.
<i>Cabin Fever</i>

710
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,912
- That.
- You see,John?

711
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,117
You gotta get us outta here now!
Clueless is startin' to go crackers!

712
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,071
Here you go.

713
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,789
- Your bread and water for today.
- But I ordered shrimp scampi.

714
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:53,668
It's more than you deserve,
ya villainous dogs!

715
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,352
Oh,Jim.

716
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,193
By rights,
I should be locked up too...

717
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:00,999
for lettin' thieves like them
aboard this ship.

718
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:03,230
Oh, it chills me...

719
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:06,118
to think that they almost
killed your little friends...

720
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,350
looking for some
daft treasure map.

721
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:12,752
None of this would've happened if I'd
have given Captain Smollet the--

722
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:17,390
What, lad?

723
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:20,631
I'm not really sure I should be talking
about this with you or with anyone.

724
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:25,396
You mean, you've really
got a treasure map?

725
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:29,155
Not any more. Mr Arrow took it and
locked it up in the captain's cabin.

726
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:31,071
You must promise
to keep it a secret.

727
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:35,233
Don't bother your head about that.
You've only told old Long John.

728
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:37,595
Now, you run along
and do your chores. Go on.

729
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,557
Go on.

730
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,716
Safely now. Safely.

731
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:10,271
Steady as she goes.

732
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,839
Oh. Mr Silver, good evening.

733
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,195
Wicked fog tonight, sir.

734
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:21,431
Reminds me of the night
we ran aground off the pampas.

735
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,080
Half the crew drowned
in leaky lifeboats.

736
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,991
Ah, it were
a terrible shame.

737
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:29,231
- Leaky lifeboats?
- Oh, a common occurrence, sir.

738
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:32,312
A little-used piece of equipment
falls into disrepair...

739
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:36,359
- and becomes, shall we say--
- Unsafe?

740
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:40,035
Oh, I'm not sayin'
our lifeboats are unsafe, sir.

741
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:44,113
I'm not sayin'
we got problems--

742
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,633
Still--

743
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:48,709
Hmm. Hmm.

744
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,998
The caulking appears tight.
No dampness under the gunwale.

745
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,877
This one seems seaworthy.

746
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:59,272
Well, sir, they do, of course, until
you get them out in the open ocean.

747
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,189
- Cast me off, Mr Silver.
- Oh, yes, sir.

748
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:08,513
Oh, sir, is there anything I can
hold for you for safekeeping?

749
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:11,114
Your hat? Your coat?

750
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,590
- Your keys?
- Hmm? My keys?

751
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:19,674
Of course. If they were to fall
overboard, it would be disastrous.

752
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,558
Oh, that it would, sir.

753
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:26,638
Cast me off, Mr Silver!

754
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,199
Aye, aye, sir!

755
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:31,476
Thank you, Mr Silver.

756
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,915
Just doin' my duty, sir.

757
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:39,958
Oh, yes,John.

758
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,638
Man overboard!

759
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:50,070
Yes.

760
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,991
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Wha--

761
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:54,833
Mr Arrow's gone overboard,
and...

762
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:57,388
all we found was his hat!

763
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:59,198
Oh, no.

764
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:10,395
And so, my friends, the sea has claimed
another loyal officer and friend.

765
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,391
- This was a person who served--
- I got it! I got it!

766
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,391
Okay, after you, Monty.

767
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:17,119
- No, after you.
- Will you just come on.

768
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,668
Mr Samuel Arrow,
a wonderful man who...

769
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,718
used to get us up from our beds
before dawn for a good flossing.

770
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:27,434
- Okay, okay. Now, spread out
and find the map.

771
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:32,071
May the wind be ever at your back,
Samuel Arrow. Rest in peace, my friend.

772
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,720
- Amen.
- Amen.

773
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:39,236
Shh.

774
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,189
- See? See?
- Wait. Open it. Open it.

775
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:46,875
No, no, no, we gotta take it
to Long John. Come on.

776
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:56,151
This apple has a worm in it.

777
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:59,357
That's not a worm.
That's my tail.

778
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,351
What's wrong?

779
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:06,149
- It just feels so weird.
- You mean, that Mr Arrow's dead?

780
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:10,916
Yeah, that, and my pants
are filled with starfish.

781
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,070
You and your hobbies!

782
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:15,355
Rizzo!

783
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,716
-Jim, we've missed you! Climb in!
- Can't. I'm doing my chores.

784
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:21,997
- Oh, come on. Share an apple.
- Yeah, come on!

785
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:29,752
- Anyway, here's the plan.
- I say we should kill that captain now.

786
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:33,389
- And then we'll get
that twit of a bear!

787
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,391
Oh, hi, Long John.

788
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:43,349
I'm an easy man.
A gentlemen of fortune, says most.

789
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,637
But it makes me sick at heart
to sail with the likes of you.

790
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,070
Now, get this straight.

791
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:53,277
If anyone mutinies
before I says so...

792
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:57,433
I'll throw you overboard
like I did that scurvy mate Mr Arrow!

793
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:02,230
I says, let the captain
steer us closer to the island.

794
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:04,231
I've got the lad's
treasure map now.

795
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:06,550
When the time is ripe,
we'll kill 'em all!

796
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:10,599
- That's what I said!
- That's what I said!

797
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:14,070
- Land ho!
- Come on, lads! Let's go!

798
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,071
Yea! Land ho!

799
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,558
Oh, my goodness.

800
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,318
Land ho!

801
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,597
Beachfront property!

802
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:32,511
Retirement estates!

803
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:34,158
- Bikinis!
- Bikinis!

804
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,839
Throw the mainsail!
Drop anchor!

805
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,832
Bring her up
hard of starboard, helmsman.

806
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:50,556
Bring those barrels
over here, lads!

807
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:53,791
Helmsman, give a hand
with the longboats.

808
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:56,189
- Captain, may I speak with you?
- I'm sort of busy right now,Jim.

809
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:59,875
But, Captain, we just heard.
Long John is planning a mutiny,

810
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,951
- Yeah.
- I see.

811
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:04,634
- Mr Silver?
- Aye, aye, Cap'n!

812
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,995
Mr Silver, I want you
to take the crew ashore at once.

813
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:09,594
We need water and provisions.
Take as long as you want.

814
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:14,637
Sir! 'Tis a task to my liking, sir.
That it is!

815
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:18,110
- Quickly, boys. Gather the officers
and meet me in my quarters. Quickly.

816
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,550
This is a lucky break.
Captain lettin' us go ashore.

817
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,517
Us with the map and all.

818
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:26,273
It's like giving the treasure to us
on a silver platter.

819
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:31,036
Aye, that it is, Polly.
Never trust a silver platter.

820
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:37,437
Follow me, Beakie. Come along.

821
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:40,229
Jim, lad!

822
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:44,154
There's room in the boat for one more.
Come along for an adventure.

823
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:47,516
- I-I can't. The captain wants me.
- Oh, what a shame!

824
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,955
I'll miss you, lad.
That I will.

825
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:54,636
Um,Jim! I seem to have
left my crutch on board.

826
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,790
Hand it to me like
a good lad, will ya?

827
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,399
There's a good boy.

828
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,998
Have to be a bit closer than that.
Can't reach it from there.

829
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:08,830
- Oh!
- Oh! Ah!

830
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:11,036
Cast away, men!
Be quick now!

831
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:13,270
Go, go, go!
Don't splash!

832
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:17,354
The plan is simple.

833
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:20,512
Once the pirates are ashore,
we set sail and return in a year or so.

834
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:23,672
- By then, all the fight
should be out of'em.

835
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:24,988
That's a brilliant plan.

836
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:27,036
- Except for one thing.
- What's that?

837
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,680
The pirates have Jim!

838
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:46,594
I'm tired!

839
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:48,272
- You're what?
- I'm gettin' tired!

840
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:51,830
- He says go faster.
- I'm gettin' tired!

841
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:08,353
Hey, man! I can't figure out
what side we're on.

842
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:11,079
Are we with the pirates
or the frog captain?

843
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:13,151
Oh, hey, man,
just play the gig.

844
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:15,356
Never get involved in politics.

845
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:17,715
Politics!
Politics!

846
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:28,033
Jim, lad!

847
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:39,513
Easy,Jim.
'Tis all in good fun.

848
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:44,230
Pleased I am to initiate you
into our enterprising, um, company.

849
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,675
Which entitles you
to all the benefits thereof.

850
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:54,232
- But I don't want any benefits.
- This is a one-time

851
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:58,950
Say no, and I will be forced
to, um, terminate our relationship.

852
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:04,268
- You're nothing but murdering pirates.
- Pirates!

853
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:10,314
Pirates. Oh,Jim.

854
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:13,630
If that's what
you're thinking...

855
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:15,392
you're dead wrong.

856
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,077
<i>When I was just a lad</i>

857
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:21,594
<i>Looking for my true vocation</i>

858
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,875
<i>My father said</i>
<i>Now, son, this choice</i>

859
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:26,315
<i>Deserves deliberation</i>

860
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,470
<i>Though you could be a doctor</i>

861
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:30,949
<i>Or perhaps a financier</i>

862
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:35,352
<i>My boy, why not consider</i>
<i>a more challenging career</i>

863
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:36,793
<i>Hey, ho, ho</i>

864
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:39,235
- <i>You'll cruise to foreign shores</i>
- Sing it, lads!

865
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:42,915
<i>-And you'll keep your mind and body</i>
<i>sound by working out of doors</i>

866
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,549
<i>True friendship and adventure</i>
<i>are what we can't live without</i>

867
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:52,078
<i>-And when you're</i>
<i>a professional pirate</i>

868
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:56,950
Upstage, lads!
This is my only number.

869
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:01,431
<i>Now take Sir Francis Drake</i>
<i>The Spanish all despise him</i>

870
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:06,310
<i>But to the British he's a hero</i>
<i>and they idolize him</i>

871
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,595
<i>It's how you look at buccaneers</i>

872
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:10,591
<i>That makes them bad or good</i>

873
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:14,514
<i>And I see us as members</i>
<i>of a noble brotherhood</i>

874
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:16,352
- Hup!
- <i>Hey, ho, ho</i>

875
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:19,159
- Oh, I love it!
- <i>We're honourable men</i>

876
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:22,550
<i>And before we lose our tempers</i>
<i>we will always count to ten</i>

877
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:26,394
<i>On occasion there may be</i>
<i>someone you have to execute</i>

878
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:30,393
<i>But when you're</i>
<i>a professional pirate</i>

879
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,471
<i>You don't have</i>
<i>to wear a suit</i>

880
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:38,436
- What?
<i>- I could have been a surgeon</i>

881
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:42,433
<i>I could have been a lawyer</i>
<i>but I just had too much heart</i>

882
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:45,318
<i>I could have been in politics</i>

883
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:49,439
<i>'Cause I've always been</i>
<i>a big spender</i>

884
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:53,559
<i>And me, I could have been</i>
<i>a contender</i>

885
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:58,635
<i>Some say that pirates steal</i>

886
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:01,280
<i>And should be feared and hated</i>

887
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:03,669
<i>I say we're victims</i>
<i>of bad press</i>

888
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,910
<i>It's all exaggerated</i>

889
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,355
<i>We'd never stab you</i>
<i>in the back</i>

890
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:10,556
<i>We'd never lie or cheat</i>

891
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,790
<i>We'rejust about the nicest guys</i>

892
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:15,110
<i>You'd ever want to meet</i>

893
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,156
Well, look at us,Jim.

894
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:19,959
We're a festival
of conviviality.

895
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:22,916
Congeniality.

896
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,913
- That's conviviality, stupid.
- That's what I said.

897
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,558
We're ready, O <i>capitn</i>.

898
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:32,519
Good. You men guard the ship
while I'm gone. We'll be back

899
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:34,716
- Aye, aye, Captain.
- Cast off, Mr Beaker.

900
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:39,309
Thanks for coming along, men.

901
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:42,472
- Are you kidding? Jim is family.
- Yeah.

902
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,636
Tell the truth, lad.

903
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:47,950
Do you really think the captain
and the squire...

904
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:50,713
are planning to share the treasure
with the likes of us?

905
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:53,758
Can't hear ya.

906
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:55,558
No?

907
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:57,949
And we being
the rightful owners.

908
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:02,670
Flint's own crew, who shed
our blood getting it here!

909
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:06,718
Join us, lad.

910
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:10,349
Donate your compass to the
treasure hunt and get a full share!

911
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:16,115
<i>Hey, ho, ho</i>
<i>It's one for all for one</i>

912
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:18,395
<i>And we'll share</i>
<i>and share alike with you</i>

913
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,277
<i>And love you like a son</i>

914
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:23,875
<i>We're gentlemen of fortune</i>
<i>and that's what we're proud to be</i>

915
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:27,270
<i>And when you're</i>
<i>a professional pirate</i>

916
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:29,794
<i>You'll be honest</i>
<i>brave and free</i>

917
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:31,677
<i>The soul of decency</i>

918
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:33,671
<i>You'll be loyal and fair</i>
<i>and on the square</i>

919
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,716
<i>And most importantly</i>

920
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:39,190
<i>When you're</i>
<i>a professional pirate</i>

921
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,999
<i>You're always in the best</i>

922
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:47,598
<i>Of company</i>

923
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:56,833
- Down!
- There! Captain Smollett

924
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:58,831
Don't get your hopes up, laddie.

925
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:02,708
I've taken the liberty of hiding
a few of my best men aboard.

926
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:04,597
If a second round follows...

927
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:07,035
it means they've
taken over the <i>Hispaniola</i>...

928
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:09,509
and I'm the new cap'n.

929
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,996
Now, then.

930
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,991
Yea!

931
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:27,238
How infortuitous our firearms
weren't loaded, Beakie.

932
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:30,357
I'll say.
We might have shot somebody.

933
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:35,795
I'm the only friend
you got in the world now,Jim.

934
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,230
Let's dig up
the treasure together, eh?

935
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:41,834
Shipmates, remember?

936
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:48,271
- We'll be needing your compass, though.
- No.

937
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:50,430
I'll be taking it
either way,Jim.

938
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:03,553
Yea!

939
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:06,791
Come on then, lad.
Let's not waste time.

940
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:10,989
Well, it's too dark
to do anything now.

941
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:13,878
We'll camp here
and wait for first light.

942
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:17,430
Oh. Hey, Rizzo, relax!
Don't be so afraid.

943
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:19,829
Oh, I've gone
way beyond afraid.

944
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:23,117
Right now I'm somewhere between
bed-wetting and a near-death experience.

945
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:28,074
- Good night, boys.
- Well, good night.

946
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:30,355
- 'Night, Rizzo.
- Yeah, sure.

947
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:38,236
Gonzo?
Is that you, Gonzo?

948
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:42,353
Boy, Gonzo, it sounds like you're
coming down with a little cold there.

949
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:46,952
I-I-I'm just gonna light a match,
if you don't mind, here.

950
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:54,713
Long John, look!

951
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,788
Flint hung 'em up there
after he gullied 'em...

952
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:00,871
to mark the trail
to the treasure.

953
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,514
Wicked sense of humour
ol' Flinty had.

954
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:08,239
- I-It's a sign. This is a cursed place.
- Yeah!

955
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:11,232
Well, there's
an informed opinion.

956
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:14,839
All right,Jim, lad,
where to from here?

957
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:17,150
''On a heading
of 1 7 9 degrees...

958
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:20,596
walk 31 2 paces
from where the dead men hang high.''

959
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:23,715
That way!

960
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:26,109
- We're gonna go? We're gonna--
- Come on!

961
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:30,751

Terrific. Captured by crazed wild pigs
and sacrificed hideously

967
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:55,308
- Are we lucky or what?
- Silence, smelly sailor mans!

968
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:57,311

What if Clueless is right?
Wh-What if it is c-cursed?

1037
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:57,593
I'll show you what
I think of your curse.

toffee-hearted,
little wuss of a crustacean!

1040
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,398
''Treasure buried here.''

1041
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:24,233
Oi, we don't even
have to dig it up!

1042
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:26,880
Come on, mates!
The treasure's ours!

1043
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:42,512
There's no treasure, Silver!
You brought us here for nothin'!

1044
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:44,716
- Yeah!
- And now we'll be tried for mutiny!

1045
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:46,233
- That's right!
- Yeah!

1046
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:50,871
I say we should kill him!

1047
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:56,000
Run, lad!
Save yourself!

1048
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:58,913
- Why are you doing this for me?
- Because I like you, boy.

1049
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,956
I hope you didn't think
I was lying about that.

1050
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:03,235
- Get him!
- Run!

1051
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:10,639
Take greeny, flippy,
bulgy-eyed one away.

1052
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:13,154
- What?
- Others stay. Chop-chop!

1053
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:17,074
- What? Oh. Ah. Oh. Uh.
- Hey, wait! Where are you taking him?

then skewer the mousie!

1058
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:35,269
- Well, how else do you think
we were gonna get him in this movie?

1059
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:37,918
- Oh!
- Whoa!

1060
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:43,438
- Oh. I wish we were back at the
Admiral Benbow eating table scraps.

1061
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:47,229
Well, this is terrible! This is the
worst thing that's ever happened to me!

1062
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:50,357
- Wait a second! I've been cut loose!
- Hiya, guys.

1063
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:54,313
-Jim, they've got Captain Smollett.
- I know. Come on.

1064
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,152
Oh, okay.
Where will we go?

1065
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:04,876
Tom, Tom, Tom!
Ohhh!

1066
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:08,431
Dead Tom's dead!

1067
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:12,831
Long John shot him!

1068
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:16,155
But Dead Tom's
always been dead.

1069
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:19,118
That's why he's
called Dead Tom.

1070
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:23,113
- Oh.
- Can we get on with this?

1071
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:24,679
- Clueless!
- Yeah, yeah?

1072
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:27,115
- Give it to him!
- Yeah!

1073
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:30,158
But, uh, it's not
even his birthday.

1074
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:32,515
- No, no, no, no! The paper!
- Oh.

1075
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:38,274
This is for you.

1076
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:43,554
- The Black Spot?
- Yeah.

1077
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:46,757
You dare to give me
the Black Spot?

1078
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:49,638
- Uh, he-he told me to.
- Wh-- Shut up, will ya?

1079
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:53,156
And it's drawn
on a page from the Bible.

1080
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:56,710
You tore a page
from the Holy Scriptures...

1081
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:59,394
- to make a pirate's death sentence?
- Uh, here.

1082
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:04,508
Ohhh, the red hot
gates of hell...

1083
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:06,318
are creeping open!

1084
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:10,837
Satan is heating
his pokers for you...

1085
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,990
you blasphemous heathens!

1086
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:17,230
- Fall down on your knees...
- Oh!

1087
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:21,313
and beg for deliverance
from damnation!

1088
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:24,868
- Please forgive us.
- Please forgive me!

1089
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:29,200
Very good.
You're forgiven.

1090
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:31,874
- Oh, thank you.
- Now untie me!

1091
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:33,996
Okay, okay. Untie him.

1092
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:37,629
- And let's go find the treasure!
- Yeah!

1093
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:39,950
Oh, oh, you are a good man.

1094
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:42,679
You are a kind man.
A handsome man.

1095
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:45,513
- Precious.
- Oh, he's-- You're precious a-and--

1096
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:47,909
- Beautiful.
- And he's beautiful. Oh.

1097
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:57,830
Yeah, here's the boat.
Oh, no!

1098
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:01,356
Well, that won't help us.
We're gonna have to swim to the ship.

1099
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:03,635
Hello! Earth to Jimbo.

1100
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:09,397
Swimming to a ship that's full of
killer pirates to save the captain

1101
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:13,632
- Look!
- Yes. The gunwale and keel

1102
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:17,594
- Mr Arrow!
- Mr Arrow!

1103
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:19,591
- Over here!
- Mr Arrow, over here!

1104
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:22,399
Oh. Oh, boys.
Come join me...

1105
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:25,711
aboard this exceptionally
safe little boat.

1106
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:27,711
Hmm.

1107
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:30,792
By the way, that Silver fellow
may not be trustworthy.

1108
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:33,633
- Ha-ha! Now he tells us!
- Yeah.

1109
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:38,917
And here's a photo opportunity
you will not want to miss.

1110
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,913
The actual jungle location for the movie
<i>Muppet Treasure Island</i>.

1111
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,831
- Oh, my goodness!
- Keep up, people.

1112
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:46,751
- Hey, when do we eat?
- Oh, my feet are killing me.

1113
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:49,798
Of all the backwater,
no-class piles of sand in the ocean...

1114
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:52,553
you had to wash up on mine.

1115
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:55,598
Benjamina, I just want you
to know that I'm sorry.

1116
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:57,989
Sorry? No, no,
sorry doesn't cut it.

1117
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:00,514
You left me standing
at the altar!

1118
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:05,473
I was on a ship headed
for Zanzibar. I got cold feet.

1119
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:08,438
You're a frog.
You're supposed to have cold feet.

1120
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:10,750
My mother came
all the way from France.

1121
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:13,593
I was wearing
her white lace dress.

1122
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:16,672
The cake was filled
with lemon custard!

1123
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:21,274
Mina, fate has brought us
together again.

1124
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:24,192
Well, actually, buried treasure
and pirates brought us together--

1125
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:26,271
Don't you start with me
about pirates!

1126
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:29,033
After you jilted me, I took
up with this Bernie Flint.

1127
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:32,317
- The man was totally codependent.
- You and Captain Flint?

1128
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:37,235
Well, he was a pirate, I was a lady.
You know the story.

1129
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:39,788
Smolly? He marooned me.

1130
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:41,472
Me!

1131
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:45,197
Oh. Oh. Oh.

1132
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:48,431
Th-This is all my fault.
Oh, what have I done to you?

1133
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:52,559
- Mushy-mushy!
- Kissy-kissy!

1134
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:00,272
Bravo, Cap'n.

1135
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:08,398
Touchin' reunion, Benjamina.

1136
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:11,790
This seems to be your day
for renewing old...

1137
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:14,194
acquaintances.

1138
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:18,754
Oh, well, hello, Long John.

1139
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:21,832
- Oh, no! Him too?
- Well, if you'd married me.

1140
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:23,672
Well, what does that
have to do with it?

1141
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:27,070
- I'm a pig! I need commitment!
- Commitment?

1142
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:31,517
Now, I'm not gonna be really patient
about this, Benjamina.

1143
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:33,670
Where is the treasure?

1144
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:41,359
Um, I just may not
tell you. Hmm.

1145
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:44,156
Oh, don't play games with me, lass.

1146
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:48,190
I tell you,
I'm not a patient man.

1147
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:51,390
Stop! Give up now...

1148
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:53,835
weak and tiny pirate mans...

1149
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:56,718
or die like stinking dogs.

1150
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:03,990
Hmm, we see you have
boom-boom sticks.

1151
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:08,033
Bye-bye.

1152
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:14,396
Oh, brother!

1153
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:16,710
- Now, Benjamina.
- What?

1154
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:19,394
Where is the treasure?

1155
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:23,234
There is no treasure.
I-It was all a clever ruse. H-Ha!

1156
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:27,199
So where did you get that
gold necklace you're wearing?

1157
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:30,033
The one made
of Spanish doubloons.

1158
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:31,599
Aye.

1159
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:33,910
Um...

1160
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,274
Shopping Channel?

1161
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:45,109
No!

1162
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:53,952
Shh.

1163
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:56,031
- Shh.
- Shh.

1164
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:00,113
Oh, fiddle!

1165
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:03,556
Make yourself useful.
Try and save us. Do something!

1166
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:05,471
Shh!

1167
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:07,710
Oh, Master Hawkins,
you've come to rescue us.

1168
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:09,711
I should've let him
live in my finger.

1169
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:19,878
We're ready,
Master Hawkins.

1170
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:22,076
- Do you think this
will work, Dr Livesey?

1171
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:25,550
My research indicates
that pirates are very superstitious.

1172
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:32,715
Boogie, boogie, boogie!

1173
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:36,349
I am the ghost
of Samuel Arrow.

1174
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:40,310
Boogie!

1175
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:50,117
Come on.
We've got to save the captain!

1176
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:52,430
You were so good, Mr Arrow.
That was beautiful.

1177
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:55,159
What do we do next?
What do we do now? Uh,Jim?

1178
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:59,040
- Weigh anchor?
- Weigh anchor.

1179
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:02,192
- Set the sails.
- Set the sails!

1180
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:06,478
- And you, Squire Trelawney.
- Uh, n-n-now, Master Hawkins, I-I-I--

1181
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:09,233
You take the helm.

1182
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:14,189
Ah! Step aside, Mr Bimbo.
I shall be taking the helm.

1183
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:15,918
Hurry, Rizzo!

1184
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:18,952
I'm going as fast as I can.

1185
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:22,078
Oh! Smolly, my love!

1186
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:23,513
Oh, oh!

1187
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:26,839
Smolly!

1188
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:30,635
You can't hurt my frog!

1189
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:33,029
Don't tell him anything, Mina.
I beg you!

1190
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:36,237
He'll only kill you too.
Don't listen to him!

1191
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:37,878
Now...

1192
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:40,076
for the last time...

1193
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:42,435
where's the blasted treasure?

1194
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:45,956
- Yeah!
- Hah!

1195
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:49,635
Stop! Stop, stop, stop, stop!
The treasure's at my place.

1196
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:52,553
North trail, split-level hut
with the pink lawn furniture.

1197
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:55,359
Now free him at once,
you scoundrel!

1198
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:06,637
You know, I'm beginning to see
a pattern in the men I date.

1199
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:09,951
Yeah, well, uh, uh,
the past is behind us.

1200
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:12,838
And the future below us.

1201
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:17,998
Oh, it's okay, Mina.
We're together again.

1202
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:20,719
Yes, despite it all...

1203
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:23,268
we have each other.

1204
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:28,118
- Oh, don't cry for me, Benjamina.
- Pardon?

1205
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:33,069
<i>Was I dumb</i>
<i>or was I blind</i>

1206
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:37,073
<i>Or did my heart</i>
<i>just lose its mind</i>

1207
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:39,913
<i>Why'd I go and throw</i>

1208
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:44,437
<i>Our perfect dream away</i>

1209
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:50,670
<i>Looking back</i>
<i>I'll never know</i>

1210
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:54,435
<i>How I ever let you go</i>

1211
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:58,877
<i>But destiny could see</i>
<i>we deserved</i>

1212
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:02,236
<i>To have another day</i>

1213
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:06,911
<i>Love led us here</i>

1214
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:12,029
<i>Right back</i>
<i>to where we belong</i>

1215
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:16,272
<i>We followed a star</i>
<i>and here we are</i>

1216
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:20,114
<i>Now heaven seems so near</i>

1217
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:24,756
<i>Love led us here</i>

1218
01:16:26,240 --> 01:16:28,196
<i>Now I know that life</i>

1219
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:31,556
<i>Can take you by surprise</i>

1220
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:35,349
<i>And sweep you off your feet</i>

1221
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:39,438
<i>Did this happen to us</i>

1222
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:44,514
<i>Or are wejust dreaming</i>

1223
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:48,319
<i>Love led us here</i>

1224
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:53,749
<i>Right back</i>
<i>to where we belong</i>

1225
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:57,628
<i>We followed a star</i>
<i>and here we are</i>

1226
01:16:57,720 --> 01:17:02,840
<i>Now heaven seems so near</i>

1227
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:06,708
<i>Love led us here</i>

1228
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:10,235
<i>So take my hand</i>

1229
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:16,399
<i>And have no fear</i>

1230
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:20,837
<i>We'll be all right</i>

1231
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:24,276
<i>Love led us</i>

1232
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:29,150
<i>Here</i>

1233
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:38,996
Oh, Smolly.
You saved me.

1234
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:49,396
Come on, men!
It's back to Blighty now, lads!

1235
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:51,516
The treasure's all ours!

1236
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:58,915
Hurry. Come on.
Get in the boat.

1237
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:02,231
Long John! Long John!
Look! The ship!

1238
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:03,878
Uh, yeah--
What are they doing?

1239
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:06,076
There's no one on board.

1240
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:13,309
It's coming
straight for us!

1241
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:15,709
I-It's the ghost
of Captain Flinty.

1242
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:17,950
He's coming to kill us.

1243
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:26,189
Come back, you cowards!

1244
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:33,391
Hawkins.

1245
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:38,916
Look. It's the captain
and the pig.

1246
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:41,393
Oh, no!

1247
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:46,478
Head for those cliffs.

1248
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:49,711
- Head for the cliffs, Squire.
- Aye, aye! Uh. Oh.

1249
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:51,870
Oh, Beakie, Beakie.
Look, look!

1250
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:54,713
I think we're going to need a net.
Come along.

1251
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:02,075
Get back there,
you yellow-bellied bilge rats!

1252
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:05,994
I'm not losing
that treasure now! Get out!

1253
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:08,071
We're lowering the net now.

1254
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:11,959
All right, let's go. Okay.
That's it. Beautiful. Beautiful.

1255
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:17,478
- We're coming, Captain Smollett!
- Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

1256
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:19,198
- Steady! Steady!
- Careful!

1257
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:24,632
<i>Au revoir, mon capitaine</i>.

1258
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:28,155
- We got 'em!
- Oh, ho, ho! Yes!

1259
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:33,268
- Ahh!
- Oh, no!

1260
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:39,076
Waldorf, you old fool!
We're heroes!

1261
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:42,277
We saved the pig
and the frog!

1262
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:45,113
Well, it was too late
to save the movie.

1263
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:48,559
Welcome aboard,
Captain Smollett.

1264
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:51,200
And welcome
to your lady pig friend.

1265
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:54,554
Ah! Look out! Ah!

1266
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:09,276
The captain must have his sword.

1267
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:11,713
Whoa!

1268
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:14,109
Wow! Ha!

1269
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:16,839
Yah!

1270
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:19,115
Captain!

1271
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:21,555
Fight, you idiots!

1272
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:29,397
Captain!

1273
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:32,438
- Here!
- Ha! Ah!

1274
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:36,399
- Wah!
- All right! No more Ms Nice Guy!

1275
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:39,430
No one maroons me
and gets away with it!

1276
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:51,157
- Good to see you alive, Mr Arrow.
- Huh! Thank you, Captain.

1277
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:53,800
Geronimo!

1278
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:55,791
Oh, what am I gonna do? Oh!

1279
01:20:55,880 --> 01:20:58,838
- Come on!
- Come on, you! Hey!

1280
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:02,276
- Oh, sorry.
- <i>En garde!</i>

1281
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:06,273
- <i>Mi casa es su casa</i>.
- Ah, I make cheese

1282
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:10,273
- Hi-yee, De Soto! Hi-ya!
- Oh, yah!

1283
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:12,271
<i>!!Cucaracha!</i>

1284
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:15,879
- Hah!
- Ahhh!

1285
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:17,791
Come on,Jerry!
He's just a kid!

1286
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:28,271
- Ohhh!
- Okay, okay, okay!

1287
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:31,716
Okay, I give.
Uncle. Uh, I'm dead.

1288
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:37,596
Oh, oh, oh, Mr Bimbo, help!

1289
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:48,795
- Am I dead?
- Huh?

1290
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:53,954
- Wonderful!
- Uh--

1291
01:21:54,040 --> 01:21:59,717
- Mr Bimbo, that was
some amazing swordplay.

1292
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:03,871
Oh, watch out, Mr Arrow!

1293
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:11,150
Well, thank you. But aren't you
supposed to be fighting against us?

1294
01:22:11,240 --> 01:22:13,629
Are you kiddin'?
I love you guys!

1295
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:16,154
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

1296
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:19,556
Cowabunga!

1297
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:23,236
Come on. Fight.
Where are you?

1298
01:22:23,320 --> 01:22:25,356
- Ohhh!
- Hmm.

1299
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:33,355
And as for you!

1300
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:37,350
- Oh!
- Silver!

1301
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:41,710
Hmm-hmm. Hah!

1302
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:47,917
Hah! Hah!

1303
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:52,352
Why don't you pick on
somebody your own size, huh?

1304
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:04,993
- Ah. Ha-ha-ha-ha!
- Wow!

1305
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:07,640
Yes! Yes! Smolly! Yes!

1306
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:12,555
- Hah!
- Yes!

1307
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:14,471
Ha-ha, Silver!

1308
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:19,114
Ha-ha, ho-ho!
Not bad for an amphibian.

1309
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:23,432
Smolly, Smolly, he's our man!
If he can't do it, no one can! Yea!

1310
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:29,115
- Ho-ho-ho! Ha-ha!
- Excuse me.

1311
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:33,672
Ohhh!

1312
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:38,435
Uh-- Uh-- Uh--

1313
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:42,440
I'm a frog.
You know, slippery hands.

1314
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:50,718
Uh, you know, I never really believed
that violence solved anything anyway.

1315
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:53,917
Really? Allow me
to disagree, Cap'n.

1316
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:58,109
Kill Captain Smollett,
and you'll have to kill me.

1317
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:00,191
Kill Jim,
and you'll have to kill me.

1318
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:02,077
Kill Gonzo,
and you'll have to kill me.

1319
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:04,230
Kill Squire Trelawney
and Mr Bimbo...

1320
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:07,710
and you'll have to
negotiate strenuously.

1321
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:09,552
Going somewhere,
John-John?

1322
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:18,113
Well, Mr Hawkins,
it seems your little family...

1323
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:20,555
has come together
against me.

1324
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:32,231
- We're doomed.
- Yeah.

1325
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:36,029
Well, you know, I, for one,
feel better about myself.

1326
01:24:36,120 --> 01:24:39,874
Yeah. A-And I believe
that I have learned a valuable lesson.

1327
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:42,997
- Why, you!
- Shut up!

1328
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:55,035
Okay, stop biting me.
Okay, I said something wrong!

1329
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:20,193
Silver!

1330
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:28,193
I suppose you'll be blowing
the whistle on me now, won't you,Jim?

1331
01:25:28,280 --> 01:25:31,716
I suppose I will. You have to return
to Bristol to stand trial.

1332
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:38,156
Oh, I'm sorry,Jim.
I got a terrible fear of hanging.

1333
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:46,191
We're shipmates, aren't we,Jim?

1334
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:49,351
Gentlemen of fortune, together.

1335
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:54,033
Give us one more chance?

1336
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:07,874
Oh, hell,Jim.
I could never harm you.

1337
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:11,035
You're honest
and brave and true.

1338
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:17,153
- You didn't learn that from me.
- I learnt it from my friends,

1339
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:21,119
Now take your oars and row away.
I never want to see you again, ever.

1340
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:31,711
Oh,Jim!

1341
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:40,950
'Tis a shame, really.
We'd have made

1342
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:02,910
Well done,Jim.
Your father would be proud.

1343
01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:08,998
Captain Smollett,
I have most distressing news.

1344
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:13,437
One of the jolly boats is missing,
and I know for a fact

1345
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:28,670
Ahhh!

1346
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:42,433
This is not fun.

1347
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:44,112
Flaubert, meet Da-Da.

1348
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:46,873
- Ready to sail, sir.
- Hmm.

1349
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:49,520
Where to,
Captain Hawkins?

1350
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:51,511
To wherever the wind
may take us.

1351
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:54,239
Off to Zanzibar,
to meet the Zanzibarbarians.

1352
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:57,312
Oh, brother.
Here they go again.

1353
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:30,231
<i>Love power</i>

1354
01:28:35,080 --> 01:28:37,878
<i>Love power</i>

1355
01:28:37,960 --> 01:28:40,520
<i>Love power</i>

1356
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:43,558
<i>A little love power</i>

1357
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:46,313
<i>Stronger than the hurricane</i>

1358
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:48,789
<i>And softer than</i>
<i>the summer rain</i>

1359
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:53,473
- <i>Love power</i>
- <i>What kind of power</i>

1360
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:55,391
<i>A little love power</i>

1361
01:28:55,480 --> 01:28:59,075
<i>It can lift you up</i>
<i>Lift you up when you get low</i>

1362
01:28:59,160 --> 01:29:02,118
<i>And make your life</i>
<i>bright as the rainbow</i>

1363
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:04,111
<i>Whoa-oh</i>

1364
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:07,033
<i>There ain't no sun</i>
<i>in the morning sky</i>

1365
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:10,271
<i>Whoa oh-oh-oh-oh</i>

1366
01:29:10,360 --> 01:29:13,477
<i>Breeze ain't blowing</i>
<i>and the bird don't fly</i>

1367
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:16,757
<i>Whoa oh-oh-oh-oh</i>

1368
01:29:16,840 --> 01:29:19,877
<i>Then someone kind</i>
<i>reaches out a hand</i>

1369
01:29:19,960 --> 01:29:22,997
<i>And smiles</i>
<i>a warm sweet smile</i>

1370
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:26,277
<i>And then your heart</i>
<i>come to understand</i>

1371
01:29:26,360 --> 01:29:29,432
<i>What make the world spin</i>
<i>Where do magic begin</i>

1372
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:31,033
<i>Someone to believe in</i>

1373
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:33,839
<i>Feel so good</i>
<i>when everybody feels</i>

1374
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:36,673
- <i>Love power</i>
- <i>There's no higher power</i>

1375
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:39,399
- <i>A little love power</i>
- <i>Nothing in the world</i>

1376
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:42,153
<i>Stronger than the hurricane</i>

1377
01:29:42,240 --> 01:29:45,357
<i>And softer</i>
<i>than the summer rain</i>

1378
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:47,874
<i>Oh, love power</i>

1379
01:29:47,960 --> 01:29:51,077
- <i>Everybody, feel it</i>
- <i>A little love power</i>

1380
01:29:51,160 --> 01:29:52,388
<i>Oh-oh-oh-oh</i>

1381
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:54,948
<i>Lift you up when you get low</i>

1382
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:57,793
<i>And make your life</i>
<i>bright as the rainbow</i>

1383
01:29:57,880 --> 01:29:59,757
<i>Whoa-oh</i>

1384
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:03,196
<i>So many people</i>
<i>they feel so bad</i>

1385
01:30:03,280 --> 01:30:05,635
<i>Whoa oh-oh-oh-oh</i>

1386
01:30:05,720 --> 01:30:09,599
<i>Yeah, they make the money</i>
<i>but they still so sad</i>

1387
01:30:09,680 --> 01:30:12,478
<i>Whoa oh-oh-oh-oh</i>

1388
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:15,757
<i>Nobody told them</i>
<i>that it ain't that stuff</i>

1389
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:19,071
<i>That makes life worthwhile</i>

1390
01:30:19,160 --> 01:30:22,118
<i>'Cause even if</i>
<i>you've got enough</i>

1391
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:25,317
<i>You got less than nothing</i>
<i>till you know for certain</i>

1392
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:27,277
<i>Enough to put your faith in</i>

1393
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:29,794
<i>It feels so good</i>
<i>when everybody feels</i>

1394
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:32,678
- <i>Love power</i>
- <i>People, can you feel it</i>

1395
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:35,149
<i>A little love power</i>

1396
01:30:35,240 --> 01:30:38,118
<i>Lift you up when you get low</i>

1397
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:40,430
<i>And make your life</i>
<i>bright as the rainbow</i>

1398
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:43,876
<i>Let me tell you now</i>

1399
01:30:43,960 --> 01:30:47,236
- <i>Whoa-oh</i>
- <i>Feel the inspiration</i>

1400
01:30:47,320 --> 01:30:49,880
- <i>Hey</i>
- <i>Don't it feel like heaven</i>

1401
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:52,520
<i>It make the soul</i>
<i>and the spirit strong</i>

1402
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:55,558
<i>When everybody come</i>
<i>and every single one</i>

1403
01:30:55,640 --> 01:30:57,949
<i>They hear the song now</i>

1404
01:30:58,040 --> 01:31:01,077
<i>Oh, love power</i>

1405
01:31:01,160 --> 01:31:03,720
<i>A little love power</i>

1406
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:06,792
<i>Stronger than the hurricane</i>

1407
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:09,394
<i>And softer</i>
<i>than the summer rain</i>

1408
01:31:09,480 --> 01:31:12,836
- <i>Can you feel it, oh</i>
- <i>Love power</i>

1409
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:15,639
- <i>What kind of power</i>
- <i>A little love power</i>

1410
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:16,948
<i>It can lift you up</i>

1411
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:19,713
<i>Lift you up when you get low</i>

1412
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:22,473
<i>And make your life</i>
<i>bright as the rainbow</i>

1413
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:26,030
<i>- One love</i>
<i>- Lift you up when you get low</i>

1414
01:31:26,120 --> 01:31:28,031
<i>-And make your life</i>
<i>bright as the rainbow</i>

1415
01:31:28,120 --> 01:31:31,715
May I call you Johnny?
Stop me if you heard this one.

1416
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:35,395
Why does the ocean roar?

1417
01:31:35,480 --> 01:31:37,311
Give up?

1418
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:40,915
You would, too, if you had
crabs on your bottom...

1419
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,468
and oysters in your bed.

1420
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:47,075
Get it? Oysters? Bed?

1421
01:31:47,160 --> 01:31:49,310
Ooh, I love that one.

1422
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:53,075
I'm tellin' ya, I got
a million more just like that.

1423
01:32:08,120 --> 01:32:10,111
<i>Was I dumb</i>

1424
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:12,839
<i>Or was I blind</i>

1425
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:16,833
<i>Or did my heart</i>
<i>just lose its mind</i>

1426
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:19,434
<i>Why'd I go and throw</i>

1427
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:24,514
<i>Our perfect dream away</i>

1428
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:27,398
<i>Oh, looking back</i>

1429
01:32:27,480 --> 01:32:30,438
<i>I'll never know</i>

1430
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:34,274
<i>How I ever let you go</i>

1431
01:32:34,360 --> 01:32:38,592
<i>But destiny could see</i>
<i>we deserve</i>

1432
01:32:38,680 --> 01:32:42,355
<i>To have another day</i>

1433
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:46,268
<i>Love led us here</i>

1434
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:51,909
<i>Right back</i>
<i>to where we belong</i>

1435
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:56,039
<i>We followed a star</i>
<i>and here we are</i>

1436
01:32:56,120 --> 01:32:59,795
<i>Now heaven seems so near</i>

1437
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:04,160
<i>Love led us here</i>

1438
01:33:05,960 --> 01:33:08,713
<i>Love led us here</i>

1439
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:12,031
<i>Ooh</i>

1440
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:13,951
<i>I confess</i>

1441
01:33:14,040 --> 01:33:15,871
<i>It's sad but true</i>

1442
01:33:15,960 --> 01:33:20,511
- <i>Sad but true</i>
- <i>I lost myself when I lost you</i>

1443
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:23,717
<i>But I held your memory</i>

1444
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:29,033
<i>Through each lonely night</i>

1445
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:31,395
<i>Oh, let's forget</i>

1446
01:33:31,480 --> 01:33:34,278
- <i>What's gone before</i>
- <i>What's gone</i>

1447
01:33:34,360 --> 01:33:38,194
- <i>Now we both</i>
<i>know so much more</i>

1448
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:42,353
<i>And we've been given</i>
<i>another chance</i>

1449
01:33:42,440 --> 01:33:45,637
<i>To make it work out right</i>

1450
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:47,711
<i>Make it work</i>

1451
01:33:47,800 --> 01:33:49,870
<i>Love led us here</i>

1452
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:55,555
<i>Right back</i>
<i>to where we belong</i>

1453
01:33:55,640 --> 01:33:59,872
<i>We followed a star</i>
<i>and here we are</i>

1454
01:33:59,960 --> 01:34:03,839
<i>Now heaven seems so near</i>

1455
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:07,953
<i>Love led us here</i>

1456
01:34:09,880 --> 01:34:15,398
<i>Now I know that life</i>
<i>can take you by surprise</i>

1457
01:34:15,480 --> 01:34:20,031
<i>And sweep you off your feet</i>

1458
01:34:20,120 --> 01:34:23,237
<i>Did this happen to us</i>

1459
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:26,790
<i>Or are we just dreamin'</i>

1460
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:31,510
<i>Dreamin'</i>

1461
01:34:37,720 --> 01:34:41,679
<i>We followed a star</i>
<i>and here we are</i>

1462
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:45,719
<i>Now heaven seems so near</i>

1463
01:34:47,160 --> 01:34:50,709
<i>Love led us here</i>

1464
01:34:52,200 --> 01:34:55,909
<i>So take my hand</i>

1465
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:01,028
<i>And have no fear</i>

1466
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:04,908
<i>We'll be all right</i>

1467
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:08,117
<i>Love led us</i>

1468
01:35:08,200 --> 01:35:15,038
<i>Here</i>
