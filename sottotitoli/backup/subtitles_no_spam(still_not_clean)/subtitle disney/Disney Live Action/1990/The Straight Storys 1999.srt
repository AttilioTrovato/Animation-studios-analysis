1
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:11,130
Hey, Rose.

2
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:12,435
Hey, Dorothy.

3
00:05:18,927 --> 00:05:20,430
I'm gonna go over there.

4
00:05:32,912 --> 00:05:33,936
We're waitin'.

5
00:05:55,664 --> 00:05:56,379
Alvin.

6
00:05:57,336 --> 00:05:58,714
Alvin Straight!

7
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:02,299
Rose left a couple of hours ago.

8
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,833
Did you hear me
hollerin' for Rose?

9
00:06:07,696 --> 00:06:09,199
I wasn't lookin' for Rose.

10
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,634
-I haven't seen Alvin today.
-Did I ask?

11
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:16,350
Straight, you're late!

12
00:06:29,393 --> 00:06:30,180
Alvin!

13
00:06:35,313 --> 00:06:35,901
Alvin!

14
00:06:40,964 --> 00:06:41,711
Alvin!

15
00:06:42,886 --> 00:06:45,389
-Come in, Bud.
-What the hell, Alvin?

16
00:06:47,784 --> 00:06:48,743
Where the hell are you?

17
00:06:49,064 --> 00:06:50,529
I can't see a thing.

18
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:52,712
Over here, Bud.

19
00:06:53,658 --> 00:06:54,770
Watch your step.

20
00:06:54,888 --> 00:06:56,513
What the hell's going on here?

21
00:06:57,014 --> 00:06:59,523
What on god's earth are you
doin' layin' on the floor?

22
00:07:00,043 --> 00:07:00,825
You nuts?

23
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,850
Supposed to be down at
Davmar's one hour ago.

24
00:07:04,965 --> 00:07:05,873
What's going on?

25
00:07:06,609 --> 00:07:08,240
Oh, my God!

26
00:07:08,601 --> 00:07:09,154
Al...

27
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:09,946
Hey, Dorothy.

28
00:07:10,007 --> 00:07:12,068
Oh my god. Oh! Oh!

29
00:07:12,147 --> 00:07:13,657
What's the number for 911?

30
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:16,275
-Put the phone down, Dorothy.
-What the hell are you doin'?

31
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:17,222
What? Oh!

32
00:07:17,475 --> 00:07:20,349
I'm gonna have to call the bar
and tell 'em we're not comin'.

33
00:07:20,549 --> 00:07:24,538
Bud Spenser, are you crazy? We have
a stricken man here.

34
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,281
Are you stricken, Alvin?

35
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:28,873
Dorothy, put the phone down!

36
00:07:29,304 --> 00:07:31,690
Dad, what's all the yellin'?

37
00:07:35,631 --> 00:07:38,709
Wh-what... uh, have
you done to my dad?

38
00:07:39,357 --> 00:07:41,244
Oh, for cry eye!

39
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:42,537
Dad?

40
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,071
Are you okay, Dad?

41
00:07:45,505 --> 00:07:47,719
I just need a little
help gettin' up, honey.

42
00:08:18,153 --> 00:08:20,732
I'm goin' to Davmar's.
I'll be right back.

43
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:22,505
Okay, Bud.

44
00:08:33,285 --> 00:08:34,238
I'm not goin'.

45
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:35,488
Dad.

46
00:08:35,647 --> 00:08:36,187
Dad!

47
00:08:36,697 --> 00:08:37,624
I'm not goin'.

48
00:08:37,685 --> 00:08:38,974
You promised me, Dad.

49
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,989
Okay, Mr. Straight, you need
to take off al your clothes,

50
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,590
except your underwear
and put this robe on.

51
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:01,527
Just bring me the doctor.

52
00:09:29,704 --> 00:09:30,811
You like birds.

53
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:35,040
I build...

54
00:09:35,707 --> 00:09:36,460
uh, birdhouses...

55
00:09:37,053 --> 00:09:37,840
uh, for bluebirds.

56
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:40,921
Oh, that's nice.

57
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,068
Yeah, it's Pete...
uh, Pete sells my...

58
00:09:45,681 --> 00:09:46,362
uh, birdhouses...

59
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:47,601
at the Ace Hardware.

60
00:09:47,928 --> 00:09:48,501
Oh?

61
00:09:49,008 --> 00:09:51,303
-I'll look for them next time I'm in.
-Yeah?

62
00:09:52,535 --> 00:09:53,627
No operation.

63
00:09:54,402 --> 00:09:56,490
Well, this morning you fall

64
00:09:56,551 --> 00:09:59,123
and can't get off the floor,
that's your hips, Alvin.

65
00:09:59,642 --> 00:10:01,918
You're going to have to use
a walker now to get around.

66
00:10:01,992 --> 00:10:02,852
No walker.

67
00:10:05,195 --> 00:10:06,951
Fine, a second cane, then.

68
00:10:07,558 --> 00:10:09,356
Now, you say you're having
trouble seeing.

69
00:10:09,417 --> 00:10:11,509
That could be a
diabetes-related problem.

70
00:10:11,729 --> 00:10:13,561
I would like to run
to run a few tests.

71
00:10:13,622 --> 00:10:16,555
No tests and I'm not
paying, so no X-rays.

72
00:10:20,055 --> 00:10:23,197
Well, I see and hear
that you smoke.

73
00:10:23,258 --> 00:10:26,106
My guess is you're in the
early stages of emphysema.

74
00:10:26,312 --> 00:10:28,685
And Alvin, you have
circulation problems

75
00:10:28,746 --> 00:10:30,943
and I'm worried about your diet.

76
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,080
If you don't make
some changes quickly,

77
00:10:36,141 --> 00:10:38,037
there will be some
serious consequences.

78
00:11:28,726 --> 00:11:31,327
It... has a... a red roof.

79
00:11:31,865 --> 00:11:33,400
Another pretty one, Rose.

80
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:37,490
I want to... uh, paint the...
uh, next one blue.

81
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,182
That's a good idea.

82
00:11:48,442 --> 00:11:50,704
What... uh, did the doctor say?

83
00:11:54,345 --> 00:11:56,233
He said I was gonna
live to be 100.

84
00:12:33,656 --> 00:12:35,835
I think I'll go
and mow the lawn.

85
00:12:36,485 --> 00:12:39,483
Uh, I can... uh, cut
it for you, Dad.

86
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:41,869
I got it, sweetheart.

87
00:13:17,487 --> 00:13:18,698
God darn!

88
00:13:39,701 --> 00:13:42,442
No, we'll... we won't
be mowin' today.

89
00:13:44,278 --> 00:13:45,356
Storm's comin' in.

90
00:13:47,206 --> 00:13:48,055
Yeah.

91
00:13:58,139 --> 00:13:59,746
I love a lightnin' storm.

92
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:01,917
Uh, me too, Dad.

93
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:26,214
Hello?

94
00:14:28,408 --> 00:14:30,578
This is... is Rose.

95
00:14:32,103 --> 00:14:32,706
Yeah...

96
00:14:33,691 --> 00:14:34,382
Yeah...

97
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,659
Uh-huh.

98
00:14:36,393 --> 00:14:37,576
Oh, no...

99
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:40,037
When?

100
00:14:42,332 --> 00:14:43,133
Okay...

101
00:14:46,409 --> 00:14:47,284
I'll tell him.

102
00:14:47,817 --> 00:14:51,236
Yeah... okay... bye.

103
00:14:59,581 --> 00:15:02,093
Uh, that was... Bobby.

104
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:05,203
Uncle Lyle... had a...

105
00:15:06,662 --> 00:15:07,475
a stroke.

106
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:16,698
Dad?

107
00:15:44,484 --> 00:15:46,661
No, Bobby, he... he
didn't say much.

108
00:15:47,536 --> 00:15:48,190
Uh, they've both...

109
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,257
uh, been so...

110
00:15:49,611 --> 00:15:50,463
uh, stubborn.

111
00:15:53,209 --> 00:15:55,028
No, no, it was
longer, I remember.

112
00:15:55,876 --> 00:16:02,080
It was... uh, July, uh, 7th, 19...
88, uh, Bobby.

113
00:16:02,181 --> 00:16:03,748
I always... remember the dates.

114
00:16:07,229 --> 00:16:07,796
Yeah.

115
00:16:12,095 --> 00:16:14,299
I don't know... uh,
what he'll do.

116
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:20,983
Rose, darlin'?

117
00:17:24,751 --> 00:17:25,383
Rose?

118
00:17:26,677 --> 00:17:28,157
I'm gonna go back on the road.

119
00:17:30,213 --> 00:17:31,827
I've gotta go see Lyle.

120
00:17:35,105 --> 00:17:35,874
But, Dad...

121
00:17:38,371 --> 00:17:39,874
How are you?

122
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:46,670
Well, I... haven't quite
got that figured yet.

123
00:18:02,842 --> 00:18:05,715
One, your eyes are bad.

124
00:18:06,278 --> 00:18:08,351
That's why you don't...
uh, drive your car.

125
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:12,332
Uh, two, Uncle Lyle... uh, lives in...
uh, Wisconsin,

126
00:18:12,444 --> 00:18:15,823
which is... uh, 317 miles away.

127
00:18:16,349 --> 00:18:19,357
You would have to... uh, stay all night...
in Des Moines.

128
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:23,885
Then there's no... uh, bus...
to Zion.

129
00:18:24,763 --> 00:18:27,851
Three, your... uh, hips are bad.

130
00:18:28,213 --> 00:18:30,597
You can hardly... uh, stand...

131
00:18:30,797 --> 00:18:34,428
for two minutes... and when you...
uh, do stand up...

132
00:18:34,882 --> 00:18:37,015
this... is the sound you make...

133
00:18:38,023 --> 00:18:40,481
when you... stand.

134
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:52,293
Uh, four, uh, you are...
uh, 73 years old...

135
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,422
You were... uh, born

136
00:18:55,509 --> 00:19:01,452
when, uh, Calvin... uh, Coolidge
was president... of America.

137
00:19:01,816 --> 00:19:05,754
Uh, you are... uh,
73 years old, Dad.

138
00:19:06,689 --> 00:19:08,897
And... I cannot drive you there.

139
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,929
Rose, darlin', I'm not dead yet.

140
00:19:18,196 --> 00:19:19,754
Uh, what are we...
uh, building, Dad?

141
00:19:23,923 --> 00:19:24,963
Havin' a party?

142
00:19:26,033 --> 00:19:28,831
Oh, jeez... I love...
uh, parties.

143
00:19:28,892 --> 00:19:30,268
Oh, me too.

144
00:19:31,164 --> 00:19:32,474
And so... where's it at?

145
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:34,488
Where's what at?

146
00:19:35,795 --> 00:19:37,122
Your... uh, party.

147
00:19:40,101 --> 00:19:41,576
I'm not havin' a party.

148
00:19:42,418 --> 00:19:43,762
I thought you were
havin' a party.

149
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,294
I am?

150
00:19:46,995 --> 00:19:50,144
Well, yeah. Look at all
that Braunschweiger.

151
00:19:51,155 --> 00:19:53,215
Oh, yeah, it's a lot
of Braunschweiger.

152
00:19:53,539 --> 00:19:56,259
It's... uh, for my dad, uh, for his...
his trip.

153
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:59,367
Uh, my dad... he's going to...
uh, Wisconsin.

154
00:20:00,107 --> 00:20:02,682
I... asked him how he's...
uh, going to get there...

155
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:05,557
Uh... but he... uh,
won't say nothing.

156
00:20:06,273 --> 00:20:08,961
Wisconsin? That is a
real party state.

157
00:20:09,515 --> 00:20:10,135
Yeah.

158
00:20:12,872 --> 00:20:16,542
I... uh, hate... uh, Braun...
uh... schweiger.

159
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,646
Yeah.

160
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:50,357
Alvin, you've got three
five-gallon cans there.

161
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,329
15 gallons of gas.

162
00:20:54,895 --> 00:20:57,050
What do you need so
much gas for, Alvin?

163
00:20:58,949 --> 00:21:01,495
Sig, you're one
nosey son of a gun.

164
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:02,956
You got that right.

165
00:21:04,891 --> 00:21:06,064
-I wanna buy that.
-What?

166
00:21:07,462 --> 00:21:07,856
What?

167
00:21:08,622 --> 00:21:09,282
The grabber.

168
00:21:16,146 --> 00:21:17,568
Oh, jeez, Alvin.

169
00:21:18,656 --> 00:21:21,059
-That's my grabber, Alvin.
-Well?

170
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:29,174
Oh, jeez, Alvin. I don't...

171
00:21:30,153 --> 00:21:31,896
I... I do have two of them...

172
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,256
I think five dollars
would be about right.

173
00:21:35,844 --> 00:21:38,227
That's a darn good
grabber, Alvin.

174
00:21:38,824 --> 00:21:39,883
-I... I...
-Well?

175
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,489
They're hard to come by, Alvin.

176
00:21:43,943 --> 00:21:46,615
It's gonna take me two months
to get another one on order.

177
00:21:57,504 --> 00:21:58,985
Jeez, Alvin, ten dollars.

178
00:21:59,577 --> 00:22:00,301
Ring her up.

179
00:22:37,581 --> 00:22:39,896
What do you need that
grabber for, Alvin?

180
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:42,055
Grabbin'.

181
00:23:36,468 --> 00:23:38,165
Oh, jeez, Dad.

182
00:23:39,805 --> 00:23:41,485
Oh, jeez, Dad.

183
00:23:59,176 --> 00:24:01,064
Listen to that old
grain elevator.

184
00:24:03,888 --> 00:24:06,870
It's... uh, harvest time.

185
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:22,206
Uh, that... uh, trailer is
too h-heavy for... for that.

186
00:24:22,539 --> 00:24:24,782
It's a lawn mower.
You're going to...

187
00:24:26,028 --> 00:24:28,353
drive a... a lawn mower
to another state?

188
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:36,686
Rosie, I've... I've
gotta go see Lyle.

189
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:41,456
And I... I've gotta make
this trip on my own.

190
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:44,475
I know you understand.

191
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:52,148
I guess so.

192
00:25:05,072 --> 00:25:06,751
Look up at the sky, Rosie.

193
00:25:20,046 --> 00:25:22,615
The sky is sure full
of stars tonight.

194
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:48,500
Crimenetto, it's Alvin and
he's driving his lawn mower.

195
00:25:56,727 --> 00:26:00,744
Alvin! What are you
settin' out to do here?

196
00:26:01,213 --> 00:26:02,879
For cry eye, Alvin!

197
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:06,004
Alvin, you're gonna get
blown right off the road,

198
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:07,066
that's what I'm afraid!

199
00:26:19,046 --> 00:26:20,831
He'll never make it
past The Grotto.

200
00:31:22,373 --> 00:31:24,493
I'm havin' a little
engine trouble.

201
00:31:25,724 --> 00:31:27,807
What the heck is that
you're driving there?

202
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:29,914
It's a Rehds.

203
00:31:30,827 --> 00:31:32,692
Could you give me
a lift into town?

204
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,765
Yeah, I can get you
as far as the Grotto.

205
00:31:34,928 --> 00:31:37,559
This is the Sun Ray Tour.
Climb on in.

206
00:31:37,976 --> 00:31:40,306
-I'll get you help there.
-I'd appreciate that.

207
00:32:01,847 --> 00:32:04,483
My Edward loved
his riding mower.

208
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:40,523
Hey, come here, hurry. Hurry up.

209
00:32:56,192 --> 00:32:56,772
Poor Alvin.

210
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:09,570
So the man... in a... pick-up,

211
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,013
he brought my dad back.

212
00:33:11,808 --> 00:33:15,429
Ohh... mm, I must've
been at the beauty shop.

213
00:33:18,981 --> 00:33:19,930
What kinda pick-up?

214
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:40,615
A Ford.

215
00:33:44,795 --> 00:33:46,899
But what's your dad
doin' with that gun?

216
00:33:47,469 --> 00:33:48,286
I don't know.

217
00:33:57,294 --> 00:33:58,642
I thought that you
have that old Rehds

218
00:33:58,703 --> 00:33:59,800
that we had the last
time, didn't I?

219
00:34:00,509 --> 00:34:01,500
That you did.

220
00:34:03,368 --> 00:34:04,990
You tradin' in that Rehds today?

221
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,943
No, I don't believe I will.

222
00:34:09,796 --> 00:34:10,814
Pete was tellin' me
told me you tried

223
00:34:10,875 --> 00:34:13,056
using that rider in a
real interestin' way.

224
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:15,516
-You still plannin' to do that?
-Still planning to, Tom.

225
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:18,116
I know better than
to try and talk

226
00:34:18,544 --> 00:34:20,750
Alvin Straight out of
somethin' he set his mind to,

227
00:34:20,811 --> 00:34:22,418
but I got to tell you Alvin,

228
00:34:23,145 --> 00:34:25,500
that you've always struck
me as a smart man.

229
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,091
Well, that's appreciated.

230
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:28,761
Until now.

231
00:34:37,001 --> 00:34:37,774
What year?

232
00:34:38,114 --> 00:34:39,216
'66.

233
00:34:39,803 --> 00:34:41,005
has a Kohler engine.

234
00:34:41,459 --> 00:34:42,645
We've used it for parts

235
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:44,654
but I always replace order and
replace them when they arrive.

236
00:34:44,824 --> 00:34:45,781
The guts are good.

237
00:34:46,758 --> 00:34:49,539
It's got the old transmission.
Nothing fancy.

238
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:53,255
-Is it a good machine?
-It's a good machine.

239
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:57,222
Well, Tom, I got $325.

240
00:34:57,555 --> 00:34:58,458
That's a fact.

241
00:34:59,304 --> 00:35:00,738
That sounds good to me, Alvin.

242
00:35:01,662 --> 00:35:03,123
Let's go settle up with Alice.

243
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,176
One more thing,

244
00:35:04,511 --> 00:35:06,702
sometime you can find out
a little about these

245
00:35:06,763 --> 00:35:09,115
thirty year old machines,
if you know who run 'em.

246
00:35:09,784 --> 00:35:12,816
-Do you know who owned it?
-You bet I do... me.

247
00:35:14,014 --> 00:35:14,729
All right.

248
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:47,261
I couldn't get a ride.

249
00:38:54,468 --> 00:38:55,185
Are you hungry?

250
00:38:57,966 --> 00:38:58,623
Whaddaya got?

251
00:39:00,496 --> 00:39:01,108
Weeners.

252
00:39:03,811 --> 00:39:04,495
Weeners?

253
00:39:06,381 --> 00:39:06,923
Weeners.

254
00:39:07,963 --> 00:39:08,754
Wanna try one?

255
00:39:26,387 --> 00:39:27,744
Here's a good stick for you.

256
00:40:07,248 --> 00:40:08,421
What a hunk of junk.

257
00:40:10,295 --> 00:40:11,368
Eat your dinner, Missy.

258
00:41:05,295 --> 00:41:05,785
So...

259
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:09,013
how long you been
out on the road?

260
00:41:10,937 --> 00:41:13,073
Well, I been travellin'
most of my life.

261
00:41:16,919 --> 00:41:17,547
Where you from?

262
00:41:18,787 --> 00:41:19,677
Laurens.

263
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:24,495
Got a wife back there?

264
00:41:25,526 --> 00:41:26,075
Kids?

265
00:41:27,941 --> 00:41:30,630
My wife, Francis
delivered 14 babies.

266
00:41:31,873 --> 00:41:33,059
Seven of 'em made it.

267
00:41:35,666 --> 00:41:37,411
My daughter, Rose lives with me.

268
00:41:40,688 --> 00:41:42,581
Francis died in '81.

269
00:41:50,486 --> 00:41:51,410
Where's your family?

270
00:41:57,938 --> 00:41:59,205
Are you runnin' away?

271
00:42:09,475 --> 00:42:11,048
How far along are ya?

272
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:16,091
Five months.

273
00:42:31,676 --> 00:42:33,889
Well, I'm headin' to
see my brother Lyle.

274
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:39,166
Huh?

275
00:42:40,913 --> 00:42:45,303
I said I'm goin' to see my
brother Lyle in Mount Zion.

276
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:48,743
-Where's that?
-Wisconsin.

277
00:42:49,209 --> 00:42:51,351
-Oh...
-Just across the state line.

278
00:42:52,505 --> 00:42:53,395
Cheddar Heads.

279
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:56,526
Aren't those the dumbest things

280
00:42:56,587 --> 00:42:58,837
you ever seen somebody
stick on their head?

281
00:43:02,225 --> 00:43:04,768
I hear that's a real
party place... Wisconsin.

282
00:43:09,598 --> 00:43:11,062
Guess I'll never
get to find out.

283
00:43:20,524 --> 00:43:21,978
There's a blanket
in the trailer.

284
00:43:22,039 --> 00:43:23,071
Why don't you go get it?

285
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:13,176
My family hates me.

286
00:44:18,681 --> 00:44:20,483
They'll really hate me
when they find out.

287
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:26,057
You didn't tell 'em?

288
00:44:27,601 --> 00:44:28,181
No.

289
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:31,445
No one knows.

290
00:44:33,302 --> 00:44:34,535
Not even my boyfriend.

291
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:43,847
Well, they may be mad,

292
00:44:44,533 --> 00:44:47,305
but I don't think they're mad
enough to wanna lose you

293
00:44:47,764 --> 00:44:49,016
or your little problem.

294
00:44:51,984 --> 00:44:53,054
I don't know about that.

295
00:44:54,303 --> 00:44:58,084
Well, of course, neither do
I, but a warm bed and a roof

296
00:44:58,951 --> 00:45:02,967
sounds a might better than
eatin' a hot dog on a stick

297
00:45:03,028 --> 00:45:06,556
with an old geezer that's
travellin' on a lawn mower.

298
00:45:15,153 --> 00:45:16,865
My daughter Rose is...

299
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:21,746
Some people call her a little
bit slow but she's not.

300
00:45:23,657 --> 00:45:27,337
She's got a mind like a
bear trap for facts.

301
00:45:29,148 --> 00:45:31,823
She keeps everything
organised around the house.

302
00:45:33,816 --> 00:45:35,356
She was a real good mom.

303
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:37,699
She had four kids.

304
00:45:40,105 --> 00:45:43,661
One night, somebody else
was watchin' the kids

305
00:45:43,722 --> 00:45:45,715
and there was a fire.

306
00:45:48,248 --> 00:45:50,350
Her second boy got
burned real bad.

307
00:45:53,110 --> 00:45:55,421
Rose had nothin' to
do with it but, ah...

308
00:45:56,621 --> 00:45:59,723
on account of the way Rose
is, the State figured

309
00:45:59,784 --> 00:46:03,228
she wasn't competent to
take care of them kids

310
00:46:03,289 --> 00:46:05,018
and they took 'em
all away from her.

311
00:46:06,763 --> 00:46:10,253
There isn't a day goes by that
she don't pine for them kids.

312
00:46:32,141 --> 00:46:35,333
When my kids were real little, I
used to play a game with 'em.

313
00:46:37,177 --> 00:46:39,649
I'd give each one of
'em a stick and...

314
00:46:40,291 --> 00:46:41,452
one for each one of 'em...

315
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:43,508
then I'd say 'you break that.'

316
00:46:43,803 --> 00:46:45,260
'Course they could, real easy.

317
00:46:47,064 --> 00:46:49,354
Then I'd say 'tie them
sticks in a bundle

318
00:46:50,017 --> 00:46:51,099
and try to break that'.

319
00:46:52,466 --> 00:46:53,277
'Course they couldn't.

320
00:46:55,503 --> 00:46:57,133
Then I'd say 'that bundle...'

321
00:46:58,805 --> 00:46:59,648
that's family.'

322
00:47:16,833 --> 00:47:18,431
Why don't you sleep
in the trailer?

323
00:47:19,693 --> 00:47:21,737
This chair's just
fine for me tonight.

324
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:24,643
No.

325
00:47:26,066 --> 00:47:27,657
I'll be fine sleepin' out here.

326
00:47:29,642 --> 00:47:31,193
Lookin' at the stars
helps me think.

327
00:47:33,788 --> 00:47:34,378
Well...

328
00:47:53,923 --> 00:47:54,429
Thank you.

329
00:50:53,284 --> 00:50:53,820
Woo!

330
00:53:13,849 --> 00:53:14,606
What the?

331
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:19,967
What the hell?

332
00:53:51,174 --> 00:53:52,914
Hey, how're you doin'?

333
00:53:52,975 --> 00:53:53,694
Doin' good.

334
00:54:37,929 --> 00:54:38,959
Hey, Irene.

335
00:54:40,602 --> 00:54:43,224
You don't think about gettin'
old when you're young.

336
00:54:44,418 --> 00:54:45,152
You shouldn't.

337
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:56,738
Must be something good
about gettin' old.

338
00:55:00,508 --> 00:55:03,146
Well, I can't imagine
anything good about being

339
00:55:03,207 --> 00:55:05,523
blind and lame at the
same time, but...

340
00:55:07,268 --> 00:55:09,692
still at my age, I've
seen about all that

341
00:55:10,552 --> 00:55:12,146
life has to dish out.

342
00:55:13,756 --> 00:55:16,528
I know to separate the
wheat from the chaff

343
00:55:17,654 --> 00:55:20,598
and let the small
stuff fall away.

344
00:55:24,113 --> 00:55:24,888
Let's go, man.

345
00:55:27,925 --> 00:55:31,517
So, ah... what's the worst
part about being old, Alvin?

346
00:55:34,158 --> 00:55:36,123
The worst part of being old is

347
00:55:36,254 --> 00:55:38,007
rememberin' when you was young.

348
00:57:40,274 --> 00:57:41,689
Can I help you, lady?

349
00:57:42,265 --> 00:57:43,658
No, you can't help me.

350
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:45,681
No one can help me.

351
00:57:46,044 --> 00:57:48,359
I've tried driving
with my lights on.

352
00:57:48,635 --> 00:57:50,440
I tried sounding my horn!

353
00:57:50,501 --> 00:57:51,718
I scream out of the window,

354
00:57:51,779 --> 00:57:53,577
I... I roll the window down

355
00:57:53,665 --> 00:57:55,453
and bang on the side of the door

356
00:57:55,513 --> 00:57:57,647
and play Public Enemy real loud!

357
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:02,849
I have prayed to St Francis of
Assisi, St Christopher too!

358
00:58:02,910 --> 00:58:05,869
What the heck! I've tried
everything a person could do

359
00:58:05,930 --> 00:58:09,175
and still every week I plough
into at least one deer!

360
00:58:09,507 --> 00:58:12,729
I have hit 13 deer
in seven weeks

361
00:58:12,790 --> 00:58:14,573
driving down this road, Mister!

362
00:58:15,630 --> 00:58:18,548
And I have to drive
down this road

363
00:58:19,055 --> 00:58:23,024
every day, 40 miles
to work and back.

364
00:58:23,762 --> 00:58:27,162
I have to drive to work
and I have to drive home!

365
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,667
Where do they come from?

366
00:58:48,411 --> 00:58:50,696
Oh... he's dead.

367
00:58:54,741 --> 00:58:56,742
And I love deer.

368
01:01:09,369 --> 01:01:12,342
Well, they sure picked the right
place to practise a burn on.

369
01:01:26,942 --> 01:01:29,067
That Rumelthanger
place was an eyesore.

370
01:02:17,279 --> 01:02:18,423
What do you suppose?

371
01:02:19,264 --> 01:02:20,345
Is that a lawn mower?

372
01:02:52,327 --> 01:02:53,241
Mister, you okay?

373
01:03:01,386 --> 01:03:02,889
Jeez, mister, you're lucky
she didn't roll on you.

374
01:03:12,653 --> 01:03:13,874
I guess the belt broke.

375
01:03:14,989 --> 01:03:16,169
I wouldn't be surprised.

376
01:03:17,001 --> 01:03:18,544
You don't have brakes
on that trailer, do you?

377
01:03:20,244 --> 01:03:22,994
Mister, I worked for John
Deere for 30 years,

378
01:03:23,055 --> 01:03:24,693
so I can tell you you
shouldn't be hauling

379
01:03:24,754 --> 01:03:26,640
a rig like that behind
a riding mower.

380
01:03:26,746 --> 01:03:28,443
At least not down
a hill like that.

381
01:03:31,757 --> 01:03:32,769
I'm Danny Riordan.

382
01:03:35,374 --> 01:03:36,315
Alvin Straight.

383
01:03:37,732 --> 01:03:40,034
Well, Alvin, let's get you
and this rig off the road

384
01:03:40,095 --> 01:03:41,851
and see what the damage is.

385
01:03:55,995 --> 01:03:57,220
Let's get this off the road.

386
01:03:59,950 --> 01:04:00,803
Sure you're okay?

387
01:04:38,929 --> 01:04:39,580
Okay.

388
01:04:41,808 --> 01:04:42,708
You okay?

389
01:04:43,134 --> 01:04:45,666
Everything all right? I'm
going back to the exercise.

390
01:04:45,856 --> 01:04:46,759
Thanks. Appreciate it.

391
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:54,683
Well...

392
01:04:56,457 --> 01:04:57,591
let's take a look at this mower.

393
01:04:58,958 --> 01:05:02,133
-This is what '65, '66?
-'66.

394
01:05:09,825 --> 01:05:10,375
Well...

395
01:05:11,434 --> 01:05:12,713
tell you right now, Alvin,

396
01:05:12,774 --> 01:05:14,237
you won't be going
anywhere tonight.

397
01:05:15,237 --> 01:05:17,859
Aside from your, ah,
drive belt being busted,

398
01:05:18,921 --> 01:05:20,355
you got transmission problems.

399
01:05:21,487 --> 01:05:23,842
-Where you headed?
-Mount Zion.

400
01:05:25,033 --> 01:05:27,503
Mount Zion, Wisconsin?
Past Prairie Du Chien?

401
01:05:28,048 --> 01:05:29,626
That's 60 more miles of hills.

402
01:05:30,069 --> 01:05:31,377
That's across the Mississippi.

403
01:05:32,580 --> 01:05:33,786
What's in Mount Zion, Alvin?

404
01:05:34,395 --> 01:05:35,778
My brother lives there.

405
01:05:36,737 --> 01:05:38,290
Why didn't you just
take your car?

406
01:05:39,477 --> 01:05:40,709
I don't have a driving license.

407
01:05:41,218 --> 01:05:42,836
Couldn't.. couldn't
he come visit you?

408
01:05:43,563 --> 01:05:44,922
He's had a bad stroke.

409
01:05:45,449 --> 01:05:46,631
Where are you coming from?

410
01:05:48,464 --> 01:05:49,371
Back a piece.

411
01:05:50,081 --> 01:05:50,853
West Union?

412
01:05:53,137 --> 01:05:54,550
-Hawkeye?
-Nope.

413
01:05:56,349 --> 01:05:58,337
Well, not New Hampton? You
haven't come that far.

414
01:06:00,331 --> 01:06:02,322
You've come a long
ways, haven't you?

415
01:06:03,671 --> 01:06:04,634
Yeah, I have.

416
01:06:05,817 --> 01:06:06,694
Laurens, Iowa.

417
01:06:07,563 --> 01:06:08,303
Laurens?

418
01:06:08,464 --> 01:06:09,957
That's west of The Grotto.

419
01:06:11,140 --> 01:06:12,937
How long have you
been on the road?

420
01:06:13,891 --> 01:06:14,698
What's the date?

421
01:06:15,943 --> 01:06:16,727
October eighth.

422
01:06:21,030 --> 01:06:21,950
Five weeks.

423
01:06:22,569 --> 01:06:24,747
I left Laurens on the
fifth of September.

424
01:06:26,593 --> 01:06:27,709
You been bunkin' in that?

425
01:06:28,408 --> 01:06:29,903
That's my rollin' home.

426
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:32,601
Where you been settin' up camp?

427
01:06:33,156 --> 01:06:34,053
In the fields.

428
01:06:34,556 --> 01:06:35,483
I pull off.

429
01:06:36,252 --> 01:06:37,426
I don't travel at night.

430
01:06:38,595 --> 01:06:40,561
Haven't you been
scared, being alone?

431
01:06:40,621 --> 01:06:42,480
There are a lot weird
people everywhere now.

432
01:06:44,733 --> 01:06:47,627
Well, ma'am, I fought in the
trenches in World War II.

433
01:06:48,387 --> 01:06:50,833
Why should I be scared
of an Iowa cornfield?

434
01:06:53,528 --> 01:06:54,852
Well, um...

435
01:06:55,292 --> 01:06:57,627
till we get this mower fixed...

436
01:06:59,166 --> 01:07:00,088
why don't you... ah,

437
01:07:00,794 --> 01:07:02,100
bivouac in our yard here?

438
01:07:03,038 --> 01:07:04,892
There's a bathroom in
the garage you can use.

439
01:07:06,244 --> 01:07:06,878
Well,

440
01:07:07,798 --> 01:07:09,808
that's awful generous
of you and I'm

441
01:07:10,373 --> 01:07:13,086
sure my machine here is
agreeable to that too.

442
01:07:16,134 --> 01:07:18,786
Sure wanna thank you folks
for helping me today.

443
01:07:19,437 --> 01:07:20,357
Well...

444
01:07:20,813 --> 01:07:22,311
there's a lot of rain forecast.

445
01:07:23,353 --> 01:07:25,280
Sure don't want to get
stuck in that trailer.

446
01:07:25,774 --> 01:07:27,179
I... I do a little woodwork.

447
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:30,256
I thought you might want
to sit under a shade...

448
01:07:30,754 --> 01:07:33,442
My daughter does woodwork.
She makes birdhouses.

449
01:07:33,623 --> 01:07:34,808
Oh, that's nice.

450
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:45,442
-You finished there?
-I believe I am.

451
01:09:14,752 --> 01:09:15,425
Hello.

452
01:09:16,138 --> 01:09:18,834
-I'm in need of a phone.
-Why, sure. Come on in.

453
01:09:19,113 --> 01:09:20,909
I wanna call my
daughter and give her

454
01:09:20,970 --> 01:09:22,498
an account of my recent travels.

455
01:09:23,294 --> 01:09:24,390
Sure. Sure. Come on in.

456
01:09:24,588 --> 01:09:25,986
If it's all the same with you,

457
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:29,049
do you happen to have one of
them phones without a cord?

458
01:09:29,930 --> 01:09:32,972
-Well, door's wide open, come on in.
-I can call from out here.

459
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:44,551
Here you go.

460
01:09:45,389 --> 01:09:46,745
You know, you're
more than welcome

461
01:09:46,806 --> 01:09:48,214
to sit down at the
kitchen table.

462
01:09:48,275 --> 01:09:49,420
Darla and I can leave the room,

463
01:09:49,481 --> 01:09:50,624
if you're lookin' for
a little privacy.

464
01:09:51,485 --> 01:09:52,670
Out here's fine.

465
01:09:53,497 --> 01:09:56,515
Is the area code still 712 here?

466
01:09:56,895 --> 01:09:59,403
No, Alvin. That hill
rolled you into 319.

467
01:09:59,940 --> 01:10:02,918
So, you need to dial one and
your area code to get her.

468
01:10:04,161 --> 01:10:05,563
712, thank you.

469
01:10:21,379 --> 01:10:21,906
'Hello? '

470
01:10:22,499 --> 01:10:23,113
Rose?

471
01:10:24,299 --> 01:10:25,016
Dad? Dad...

472
01:10:25,746 --> 01:10:26,306
Dad!

473
01:10:27,718 --> 01:10:30,377
Uh, I'm... so glad to hear you.

474
01:10:39,977 --> 01:10:41,901
It's gonna cost him a
bundle to fix that mower.

475
01:10:42,863 --> 01:10:44,306
I don't think he's got
that kinda money.

476
01:10:45,632 --> 01:10:48,291
I wouldn't drive that
thing to Excelsior.

477
01:10:48,954 --> 01:10:50,238
It's a lawn mower,
for God's sake.

478
01:10:51,792 --> 01:10:52,936
Uh, your social security cheque?

479
01:10:54,409 --> 01:10:55,375
Ah... it's here, Dad.

480
01:10:56,313 --> 01:10:58,086
Rose, can you send me my cheque?

481
01:10:59,441 --> 01:11:00,021
Uh, yeah.

482
01:11:01,561 --> 01:11:03,435
He's damn lucky he made it
to the bottom of that hill.

483
01:11:03,496 --> 01:11:04,321
He could've been killed.

484
01:11:05,048 --> 01:11:07,102
-Easily. He could've been killed.
-Yeah. Mm-hm.

485
01:11:08,713 --> 01:11:09,972
He's none too strong.

486
01:11:10,664 --> 01:11:13,092
Did you see how he has to
walk with the canes?

487
01:11:13,259 --> 01:11:14,039
Yeah. Mm-hm.

488
01:11:14,714 --> 01:11:15,640
Okay, Dad.

489
01:11:21,436 --> 01:11:23,357
I... I...

490
01:11:26,125 --> 01:11:27,630
Okay, okay, Dad,

491
01:11:28,141 --> 01:11:30,300
okay. I... I have a pencil, Dad.

492
01:11:31,811 --> 01:11:32,804
The hills just get worse

493
01:11:32,865 --> 01:11:34,202
the closer you get
to the Mississippi.

494
01:11:39,256 --> 01:11:40,646
Go ahead and drive him, honey.

495
01:11:40,707 --> 01:11:42,817
Mount Zion can't be half a day.
It's fine.

496
01:11:45,546 --> 01:11:47,250
You're a good man,
Danny Riordan.

497
01:11:48,802 --> 01:11:51,725
And that's why I married you,
despite what my mother said.

498
01:11:55,786 --> 01:11:56,502
Now, shoo!

499
01:11:56,825 --> 01:11:57,339
Dad?

500
01:11:59,129 --> 01:11:59,950
I miss you, Dad.

501
01:12:01,188 --> 01:12:02,266
I love you, Rosie.

502
01:12:03,097 --> 01:12:04,070
'I love you too, Dad.'

503
01:12:05,390 --> 01:12:06,138
Uh, bye, Dad.

504
01:12:08,263 --> 01:12:09,159
Bye... Dad.

505
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:13,524
Ahem.

506
01:12:44,206 --> 01:12:45,234
What are you cookin'
there, Alvin?

507
01:12:45,295 --> 01:12:47,638
Oh, I'm makin' my
Mexican coffee.

508
01:12:47,731 --> 01:12:49,340
Ah. Mind if I join you?

509
01:12:50,305 --> 01:12:52,208
Get you a chair...
that iron one there.

510
01:12:56,545 --> 01:12:58,941
You'll be a guest in
your own back yard.

511
01:13:04,504 --> 01:13:06,519
I talked to the Olsen twins,

512
01:13:06,706 --> 01:13:07,569
and, ah...

513
01:13:08,562 --> 01:13:09,959
they estimate it'll cost around

514
01:13:10,504 --> 01:13:12,917
250 dollars to get
your mower fixed.

515
01:13:14,184 --> 01:13:16,031
Well, that's twice
what it oughta be,

516
01:13:16,881 --> 01:13:18,692
I guess it's cos
they're twins, huh?

517
01:13:22,575 --> 01:13:23,435
You know... uh..

518
01:13:24,195 --> 01:13:26,725
I'd be happy to drive you the
rest of the way to Mount Zion.

519
01:13:27,452 --> 01:13:29,370
Be a nice Sunday drive
for me and Darla.

520
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:31,555
We enjoy crossin' the river,

521
01:13:31,885 --> 01:13:33,628
especially now with
the trees in colour.

522
01:13:34,684 --> 01:13:36,456
Well, I appreciate that, but...

523
01:13:37,471 --> 01:13:39,417
I wanna finish this
one my own way.

524
01:13:52,681 --> 01:13:53,338
Try this.

525
01:13:59,024 --> 01:13:59,564
Thank you.

526
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:04,194
Well, you know, Alvin, there's a

527
01:14:05,244 --> 01:14:07,871
lotta hills bigger than Clairmont's
between here and Zion.

528
01:14:08,866 --> 01:14:11,136
Even if you get that
mower runnin' again,

529
01:14:11,569 --> 01:14:13,334
I mean there is no guarantee
it won't break down.

530
01:14:14,288 --> 01:14:17,125
Well, you're a kind man
talkin' to a stubborn man.

531
01:14:18,133 --> 01:14:20,307
I still wanna finish
this the way I started.

532
01:14:25,379 --> 01:14:26,211
No, no...

533
01:14:28,672 --> 01:14:29,758
Hi, Verlyn.

534
01:14:30,179 --> 01:14:31,932
-How the heck you doin'?
-Fine.

535
01:14:32,204 --> 01:14:33,057
Wonderful.

536
01:14:33,767 --> 01:14:34,716
He's there.

537
01:14:48,312 --> 01:14:48,852
Well...

538
01:14:50,162 --> 01:14:51,468
they gave you a plate
of her brownies.

539
01:14:51,528 --> 01:14:52,004
Yeah.

540
01:14:53,447 --> 01:14:54,821
How's that for timing?

541
01:14:55,550 --> 01:14:57,224
Janet makes the best brownies...

542
01:14:57,284 --> 01:14:58,507
in Lafayette county.

543
01:14:59,377 --> 01:15:02,198
She won prizes every
year at the county fair.

544
01:15:02,833 --> 01:15:04,791
-Mmm... help yourself.
-Thank you.

545
01:15:10,364 --> 01:15:13,804
Mmm... I've been doin' errands
and I'm heading for a beer.

546
01:15:14,008 --> 01:15:15,716
I thought you'd like to join me.

547
01:15:16,951 --> 01:15:18,434
Well, I don't drink
any more, but...

548
01:15:19,589 --> 01:15:21,926
I'm always up for a
change of scenery.

549
01:15:21,987 --> 01:15:23,271
Well, come on.

550
01:15:32,623 --> 01:15:35,647
Well, I'm ridin' a little higher
and going a little faster.

551
01:15:35,864 --> 01:15:37,886
Except when you came
down that hill.

552
01:15:47,709 --> 01:15:50,776
I picked up a mournful taste
for liquor in France.

553
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:54,008
When I came back, I couldn't
drink enough of it.

554
01:15:55,946 --> 01:15:58,176
I wasn't worth a stick
of stove wood...

555
01:15:59,869 --> 01:16:00,793
I was mean.

556
01:16:03,767 --> 01:16:05,087
A preacher helped me

557
01:16:05,561 --> 01:16:07,911
put some distance between
me and the bottle.

558
01:16:10,199 --> 01:16:11,474
And he helped me see...

559
01:16:11,868 --> 01:16:14,646
the reason I was drinkin', I
was seein' all them things

560
01:16:15,553 --> 01:16:17,110
here, that I'd seen over there.

561
01:16:23,670 --> 01:16:28,674
# Though things may look very
dark, your dream is not... #

562
01:16:29,272 --> 01:16:31,261
Lots of men came
back drinkin' hard.

563
01:16:34,339 --> 01:16:34,924
Well...

564
01:16:36,228 --> 01:16:37,747
everyone tryin' to forget.

565
01:16:39,788 --> 01:16:41,814
I can see it in a
man right away.

566
01:16:45,509 --> 01:16:45,920
Yup.

567
01:16:47,519 --> 01:16:52,438
# The rainbow, you
will suddenly... #

568
01:17:04,707 --> 01:17:05,755
There was one time...

569
01:17:09,149 --> 01:17:10,366
when we just...

570
01:17:12,585 --> 01:17:13,387
were waiting

571
01:17:14,251 --> 01:17:17,211
for the first warm
meal in ten days.

572
01:17:23,763 --> 01:17:26,304
We... thought we'd
seen the worst.

573
01:17:28,977 --> 01:17:31,699
We hadn't had much
trouble from the air.

574
01:17:35,817 --> 01:17:37,060
I was on the rise...

575
01:17:39,180 --> 01:17:40,263
with the quartermaster,

576
01:17:41,502 --> 01:17:43,677
workin' on more coffee
for me and my buddies.

577
01:17:47,745 --> 01:17:51,154
A stray Fokker came
over the treetops...

578
01:17:52,208 --> 01:17:53,716
and dropped an incendiary

579
01:17:54,877 --> 01:17:55,717
on the mess tent.

580
01:17:56,826 --> 01:17:57,994
All my buddies...

581
01:18:02,083 --> 01:18:05,546
The Kraut then banked right in
front of me on that hill...

582
01:18:07,349 --> 01:18:10,866
and now I can... see the...
Swastika.

583
01:18:23,821 --> 01:18:26,373
That is one thing that
I can't shake loose...

584
01:18:27,915 --> 01:18:30,353
All my buddies faces
are still young.

585
01:18:34,322 --> 01:18:36,239
And the thing is,

586
01:18:36,744 --> 01:18:39,231
the more years I have,
the more they've lost.

587
01:18:41,893 --> 01:18:44,631
And it's not always
buddies faces that I see,

588
01:18:44,692 --> 01:18:46,539
sometime they're German faces.

589
01:18:50,043 --> 01:18:53,492
Near the end we were
shootin' moon-faced boys.

590
01:19:00,501 --> 01:19:01,633
I was a sniper.

591
01:19:03,122 --> 01:19:04,142
Where I grew up,

592
01:19:04,529 --> 01:19:06,781
you learned how to
shoot to hunt food.

593
01:19:08,153 --> 01:19:09,598
They'd post me up front.

594
01:19:11,174 --> 01:19:12,911
Darn near ahead of the lines.

595
01:19:15,316 --> 01:19:17,491
And I'd sit... forever.

596
01:19:20,083 --> 01:19:23,239
It's an amazing thing what you
can see while you're sittin'.

597
01:19:25,335 --> 01:19:27,817
I'd look for the officers,

598
01:19:28,273 --> 01:19:30,035
the radio guys or

599
01:19:30,902 --> 01:19:32,008
artillery spotter.

600
01:19:33,027 --> 01:19:37,067
Sometime I'd spot a
gun nest by the smoke

601
01:19:37,902 --> 01:19:39,047
and I'd fire into it.

602
01:19:41,089 --> 01:19:43,779
Sometime it was just a
movement in the woods.

603
01:19:50,364 --> 01:19:51,516
We had a scout,

604
01:19:53,541 --> 01:19:54,361
a little fella...

605
01:19:56,057 --> 01:19:56,987
name of Kotz.

606
01:19:59,964 --> 01:20:02,423
He was a Polish boy
from Milwaukee.

607
01:20:05,884 --> 01:20:08,947
He'd always take recon and
he was darn good at it.

608
01:20:10,430 --> 01:20:14,378
We went by his word and he
saved our skin many a time.

609
01:20:18,327 --> 01:20:19,318
He was a little fella...

610
01:20:26,685 --> 01:20:28,581
We'd broken out of
the hedgerows...

611
01:20:31,106 --> 01:20:33,392
We were makin' a run
across the open

612
01:20:35,372 --> 01:20:36,883
and we come upon a woods.

613
01:20:39,886 --> 01:20:41,678
We started drawin' fire.

614
01:20:43,557 --> 01:20:45,483
I took my usual position...

615
01:20:47,811 --> 01:20:51,020
and I saw somethin'
movin', real slow like.

616
01:20:53,514 --> 01:20:54,745
I waited ten minutes,

617
01:20:56,049 --> 01:20:58,450
it moved again and I shot.

618
01:21:00,322 --> 01:21:01,299
The movement stopped.

619
01:21:04,629 --> 01:21:06,585
The next day we found Kotz...

620
01:21:08,053 --> 01:21:08,720
head shot.

621
01:21:10,882 --> 01:21:13,497
He'd been workin' his way
back toward our lines.

622
01:21:16,670 --> 01:21:17,913
Everyone in the unit

623
01:21:18,799 --> 01:21:20,913
thought a German sniper
had taken him...

624
01:21:24,266 --> 01:21:26,267
Everyone, all these years.

625
01:21:28,618 --> 01:21:29,854
Everyone but me.

626
01:22:27,715 --> 01:22:28,676
Ha ha!

627
01:22:29,550 --> 01:22:31,917
See, Harald... brainiac...

628
01:22:34,530 --> 01:22:37,719
Got the mower assembly free with
this here little old wrench...

629
01:22:38,493 --> 01:22:39,824
You said it wouldn't work.

630
01:22:40,864 --> 01:22:42,133
I'd say it worked pretty good.

631
01:22:43,133 --> 01:22:43,913
Wouldn't you?

632
01:22:48,189 --> 01:22:49,309
So help me slide her out.

633
01:22:49,759 --> 01:22:50,754
We can get settled up.

634
01:23:19,170 --> 01:23:21,973
Uh... I got parts and labour

635
01:23:22,434 --> 01:23:24,519
that add up to $247.80.

636
01:23:29,435 --> 01:23:30,625
Well, I'd say that's

637
01:23:31,255 --> 01:23:33,080
a little heavy for light work.

638
01:23:33,493 --> 01:23:34,282
Don't you think?

639
01:23:36,034 --> 01:23:38,297
I've got an old man's
eyes, but, ah...

640
01:23:38,971 --> 01:23:41,619
I'm noticin' some new tyre here.

641
01:23:42,231 --> 01:23:43,697
Well, now... ah,

642
01:23:44,300 --> 01:23:45,967
we got those off a re-sell,

643
01:23:46,086 --> 01:23:47,161
but the treads are good!

644
01:23:48,653 --> 01:23:51,708
Well, friend, are you chargin'
me for good or for new?

645
01:23:53,411 --> 01:23:56,306
Ahhhh... Thorvald?

646
01:23:56,973 --> 01:24:00,250
Ahh... we can make
an adjustment there.

647
01:24:01,554 --> 01:24:06,498
Well, I think the adjustment
should be about thirty dollars.

648
01:24:07,858 --> 01:24:09,501
Is that what your
pencil's sayin'?

649
01:24:10,879 --> 01:24:13,236
And, ah... about the labour...

650
01:24:15,230 --> 01:24:19,028
I appreciate that you boys have
done some real time on this, but...

651
01:24:20,199 --> 01:24:23,256
of course, a man's gotta ask
when he's workin' with twins...

652
01:24:24,225 --> 01:24:26,334
especially a bickerin' pair...-

653
01:24:28,132 --> 01:24:29,784
how much workin' was fightin'?

654
01:24:30,477 --> 01:24:31,476
He got that right.

655
01:24:31,733 --> 01:24:32,878
Shut up, Danny.

656
01:24:33,936 --> 01:24:37,799
If I was to judge by this
joyous affair I saw today,

657
01:24:37,860 --> 01:24:41,685
I would calculate maybe 20 per
cent taken off the labour.

658
01:24:43,149 --> 01:24:44,566
Anything else, mister?

659
01:24:47,513 --> 01:24:49,797
Well, I'm not from
these parts, but

660
01:24:50,741 --> 01:24:52,825
where I come from,
I would say that

661
01:24:52,886 --> 01:24:56,141
that was a little
rich for Iowa oil.

662
01:24:56,838 --> 01:24:58,533
Take the oil, no charge.

663
01:24:58,593 --> 01:25:02,367
Well, that's a splendid offer
and I do appreciate it.

664
01:25:04,450 --> 01:25:05,291
What's the tally?

665
01:25:06,980 --> 01:25:09,106
Ah... ahhh...

666
01:25:15,860 --> 01:25:16,996
Hundred and eighty even?

667
01:25:17,968 --> 01:25:18,503
Done.

668
01:25:21,068 --> 01:25:25,346
Thanks to you boys, I'm gonna
get this rig back on the road.

669
01:25:26,319 --> 01:25:29,392
I've drove it all the way
across Iowa and I'm hopin'

670
01:25:30,066 --> 01:25:32,164
it holds on till I
get to Wisconsin.

671
01:25:33,251 --> 01:25:34,482
My brother lives there.

672
01:25:34,799 --> 01:25:36,519
I haven't seen him in ten years.

673
01:25:38,598 --> 01:25:40,954
There's no one knows
your life better

674
01:25:41,022 --> 01:25:43,306
than a brother that's
near your age.

675
01:25:44,194 --> 01:25:46,289
He knows who and what you are

676
01:25:46,349 --> 01:25:47,775
better than anyone on Earth.

677
01:25:49,602 --> 01:25:51,601
My brother and I said some...

678
01:25:52,604 --> 01:25:55,097
unforgivable things
the last time we met,

679
01:25:57,587 --> 01:25:59,546
but, I'm tryin' to
put that behind me.

680
01:26:01,656 --> 01:26:05,834
And this trip is a hard swallow...
of my pride,

681
01:26:08,175 --> 01:26:09,589
I just hope I'm not too late.

682
01:26:19,551 --> 01:26:21,112
A brother's a brother.

683
01:26:33,168 --> 01:26:33,855
Well...

684
01:26:36,318 --> 01:26:37,657
Guess I'll be turnin' in.

685
01:26:38,943 --> 01:26:41,875
I'll, ah... see you in the
morning, then, before you go.

686
01:26:43,322 --> 01:26:44,785
I'm gonna leave awful early.

687
01:27:05,219 --> 01:27:08,614
I wanna thank you for your
kindness to a stranger.

688
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:12,529
It's been a genuine pleasure
havin' you here, Alvin.

689
01:27:13,686 --> 01:27:14,719
Write to us, sometime.

690
01:27:16,149 --> 01:27:16,822
I will.

691
01:32:04,977 --> 01:32:06,290
I noticed your camp fire.

692
01:32:08,081 --> 01:32:09,047
I brought you some dinner...

693
01:32:09,698 --> 01:32:11,240
Mashed potatoes, meat loaf.

694
01:32:12,481 --> 01:32:15,052
Well, thank you kindly.
I've had my dinner,

695
01:32:15,112 --> 01:32:17,913
but would you join
me for a while?

696
01:32:18,182 --> 01:32:18,785
Sure.

697
01:32:26,879 --> 01:32:27,809
Thank you.

698
01:32:36,773 --> 01:32:38,847
I hope you don't
mind me trespassin'.

699
01:32:39,227 --> 01:32:40,678
Oh, no, not at all.

700
01:32:41,764 --> 01:32:42,690
Made a fine choice.

701
01:32:44,133 --> 01:32:45,227
You're camped next to

702
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:47,404
one of the oldest
cemeteries in the Midwest.

703
01:32:48,527 --> 01:32:49,613
French Catholic trappers.

704
01:32:50,743 --> 01:32:53,189
-The Marquette party.
-Two of his men.

705
01:32:56,695 --> 01:32:57,745
I couldn't help but

706
01:32:58,905 --> 01:33:02,411
notice the rather unusual
mode of transport.

707
01:33:03,984 --> 01:33:07,789
Well, you're not the first
person to notice that, Padre.

708
01:33:10,012 --> 01:33:12,205
My eyes are bad. I can't drive.

709
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:15,812
I don't like someone
else drivin' the bus,

710
01:33:16,612 --> 01:33:18,793
and I've got to get out
to my brother's place.

711
01:33:19,403 --> 01:33:20,212
Fair enough.

712
01:33:21,029 --> 01:33:21,821
Where is he?

713
01:33:22,569 --> 01:33:25,200
Well, he's so close, I can
practically feel him.

714
01:33:25,953 --> 01:33:26,751
Mount Zion.

715
01:33:28,188 --> 01:33:29,126
What's his name?

716
01:33:29,951 --> 01:33:31,016
Lyle Straight.

717
01:33:33,348 --> 01:33:34,346
Is he that fella that

718
01:33:35,930 --> 01:33:37,027
came in with a stroke

719
01:33:37,707 --> 01:33:38,558
some weeks ago?

720
01:33:38,636 --> 01:33:40,010
That's right. Do you know him?

721
01:33:41,573 --> 01:33:43,818
I do some work at the
hospital over in Boscobel.

722
01:33:43,879 --> 01:33:45,688
I remember him comin' in.

723
01:33:46,415 --> 01:33:47,866
Caught my attention because...

724
01:33:48,282 --> 01:33:49,230
he lives in my parish.

725
01:33:49,707 --> 01:33:50,773
Well, he's a Baptist.

726
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:53,757
Oh, I believe he told me that.

727
01:33:54,843 --> 01:33:56,911
he told me a few things,
matter of fact,

728
01:33:57,381 --> 01:34:00,114
but he didn't mention
having a brother.

729
01:34:02,834 --> 01:34:06,614
Well, neither one of us has had
a brother for quite some time.

730
01:34:12,021 --> 01:34:12,992
So, you saw him?

731
01:34:13,685 --> 01:34:14,586
Is he all right?

732
01:34:15,288 --> 01:34:16,323
I only saw him that once

733
01:34:16,384 --> 01:34:18,651
and I haven't heard
anything more.

734
01:34:33,584 --> 01:34:37,360
Well, Lyle and I grew up as
close as brothers could be.

735
01:34:38,859 --> 01:34:41,773
We were raised on a farm
in Moorhead, Minnesota.

736
01:34:43,923 --> 01:34:44,783
We worked hard.

737
01:34:46,949 --> 01:34:48,988
My mom and dad darn
near killed themselves

738
01:34:49,049 --> 01:34:51,342
tryin' to make that farm work.

739
01:34:53,326 --> 01:34:54,460
And me and Lyle would

740
01:34:54,873 --> 01:34:56,710
make games out of our chores.

741
01:34:58,744 --> 01:35:01,724
We'd dream up somethin'
about racin' and wagerin'

742
01:35:03,063 --> 01:35:05,683
do anything to keep our
mind off the cold.

743
01:35:06,723 --> 01:35:07,925
Lord, it was cold.

744
01:35:09,068 --> 01:35:12,519
He and I used to sleep
out in the yard

745
01:35:12,933 --> 01:35:15,141
every summer night,
if it wasn't pourin'.

746
01:35:16,037 --> 01:35:18,803
Nine months of winter, we
couldn't get enough summer.

747
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:23,175
We'd bunk down when
the sun went down.

748
01:35:24,839 --> 01:35:28,367
We'd talk to each other
until we went to sleep.

749
01:35:28,777 --> 01:35:31,546
We'd talk about the stars and

750
01:35:32,934 --> 01:35:36,966
whether there might be somebody
else like us out in space,

751
01:35:38,595 --> 01:35:40,178
places we wanted to go and...

752
01:35:41,441 --> 01:35:43,626
it made our trials seem smaller.

753
01:35:46,784 --> 01:35:49,759
Yeah, we pretty much talked
each other through growin' up.

754
01:35:55,314 --> 01:35:57,724
Oh, whatever

755
01:35:59,795 --> 01:36:01,139
happened between you two?

756
01:36:03,736 --> 01:36:05,424
Story as old as the Bible.

757
01:36:06,616 --> 01:36:07,483
Cain and Abel.

758
01:36:09,439 --> 01:36:10,173
Anger,

759
01:36:11,171 --> 01:36:11,968
vanity.

760
01:36:14,220 --> 01:36:16,384
You mix that together
with liquor, and...

761
01:36:17,699 --> 01:36:20,862
you've got two brothers who
haven't spoken in ten years.

762
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:26,567
Well, whatever it was that made

763
01:36:27,822 --> 01:36:29,266
me and Lyle so mad...

764
01:36:31,746 --> 01:36:33,079
don't matter any more.

765
01:36:34,929 --> 01:36:36,370
I wanna make peace.

766
01:36:37,948 --> 01:36:39,204
I wanna sit with him,

767
01:36:41,031 --> 01:36:42,397
look up at the stars...

768
01:36:44,104 --> 01:36:45,310
like we used to do...

769
01:36:47,087 --> 01:36:48,087
so long ago.

770
01:36:55,179 --> 01:36:56,051
Well, sir...

771
01:36:57,905 --> 01:36:59,560
I say 'Amen' to that.

772
01:37:57,621 --> 01:37:58,081
Howdy.

773
01:38:17,337 --> 01:38:19,800
I haven't had a drink
in a lot of years.

774
01:38:19,893 --> 01:38:21,881
But now I'm gonna
have me a cold beer.

775
01:38:22,624 --> 01:38:23,441
What flavour?

776
01:38:24,633 --> 01:38:26,198
What does a Miller's
Lite taste like?

777
01:38:38,285 --> 01:38:38,921
There you go.

778
01:38:44,771 --> 01:38:46,733
-How's it taste?
-It's good.

779
01:38:48,099 --> 01:38:49,805
-Keep the change.
-Thank you.

780
01:38:52,122 --> 01:38:53,881
It's an interesting rig
you got out there.

781
01:38:54,383 --> 01:38:55,623
Make it up the hill okay?

782
01:38:56,951 --> 01:38:59,535
That hill and 200
more just like it.

783
01:39:00,738 --> 01:39:01,643
How far did ya come?

784
01:39:02,459 --> 01:39:03,212
From Iowa.

785
01:39:04,396 --> 01:39:06,489
I'm headed for Lyle
Straight's place.

786
01:39:06,713 --> 01:39:07,414
Iowa!

787
01:39:08,231 --> 01:39:09,865
My God, you must be thirsty.

788
01:39:56,693 --> 01:39:57,453
Another beer?

789
01:39:58,169 --> 01:39:59,474
This will do me fine.

790
01:40:00,356 --> 01:40:02,812
I wonder could you point
me to Lyle's place?

791
01:40:03,348 --> 01:40:05,420
I haven't seen him in
an awful long time.

792
01:40:07,362 --> 01:40:08,541
Well, you just... ah,

793
01:40:08,982 --> 01:40:11,440
cross 61 here, on 'W',

794
01:40:11,907 --> 01:40:14,317
Take 'W' on down to
Weed Road and then

795
01:40:14,584 --> 01:40:16,008
on to Remington Road.

796
01:40:16,532 --> 01:40:18,656
On your right will
be Lyle's place.

797
01:40:20,595 --> 01:40:21,667
If he's there that is.

798
01:42:44,302 --> 01:42:45,475
How you doin' pard?

799
01:42:46,034 --> 01:42:47,187
Not too good.

800
01:42:51,581 --> 01:42:53,181
This thing's just tired.

801
01:42:58,945 --> 01:43:01,023
Is there anything I
can do to help you?

802
01:43:02,814 --> 01:43:05,893
Well, I don't know.
It just quit on me.

803
01:43:06,135 --> 01:43:07,960
Why don't you try her again?

804
01:43:12,971 --> 01:43:15,472
I'm headin' to Lyle
Straight's place.

805
01:45:21,415 --> 01:45:22,123
Lyle!

806
01:45:27,491 --> 01:45:28,138
Lyle?

807
01:45:38,618 --> 01:45:39,444
Alvin?

808
01:46:20,885 --> 01:46:21,552
Sit down, Alvin.

809
01:47:14,009 --> 01:47:16,356
Did you ride that thing all
the way out here to see me?

810
01:47:20,653 --> 01:47:21,517
I did, Lyle.
