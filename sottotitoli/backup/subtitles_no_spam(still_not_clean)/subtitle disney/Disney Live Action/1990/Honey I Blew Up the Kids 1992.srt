0
00:00:03,146 --> 00:00:18,818

1
00:03:22,745 --> 00:03:25,247
- Morning, folks. How you doing?
- Morning, Ozzie.

2
00:03:44,642 --> 00:03:46,810
I hear he's some kind of inventor.

3
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:17,675
Nick, breakfast.

4
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:23,722
Nick!

5
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:25,516
I'm coming.

6
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:42,157
- Wayne.
- Yeah, honey?

7
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:44,868
- Where's the baby?
- He's in the playpen.

8
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:46,912
He gets out of the playpen.

9
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:49,373
No, I fixed it.

10
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,333
Sweetheart,
I hate to remind you,

11
00:04:51,417 --> 00:04:54,169
but the last time
you fixed the playpen,

12
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:55,796
he still got out of it.

13
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:58,048
Well, he won't get out this time.

14
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:02,011
Hi. Will you, big buddy, huh?

15
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:05,014
I'm certainly capable
of fixing a playpen, aren't I?

16
00:05:05,431 --> 00:05:06,974
You're just a little baby after all.

17
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:08,851
- Your hat?
- It's my helmet.

18
00:05:09,018 --> 00:05:10,728
- New one?
- Yeah, it's a new one.

19
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:12,521
See, it shaves me. See that?

20
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:15,149
There.

21
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,653
Amy, it's decided.
I'm going with you. Period.

22
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,821
Mom, in the first place,

23
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:22,948
I'm not the first girl
who has ever gone away to college.

24
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:24,283
And in the second place, we're...

25
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:25,826
- Mom.
- Excuse me.

26
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:27,786
Amy, I'm gonna help you
get settled in.

27
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:28,912
That's it.

28
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:31,915
- Want a noise? Noise?
- Yeah, I want to hear a noise.

29
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:33,292
- This one?
- Yeah, not this time.

30
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:34,668
- This one.
- Okay.

31
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:41,425
- Hear it?
- Yep, I heard it.

32
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:43,052
- More?
- Sure.

33
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:45,304
Mom, let's say you were a girl.

34
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:47,389
I think I can visualize it.

35
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:50,601
Would you think I was a nerd?
Just by looking at me I mean.

36
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,812
It's a rhetorical question, mom.
It doesn't require an answer.

37
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:56,315
Am I any girl in particular?

38
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:57,566
No.

39
00:05:57,733 --> 00:05:59,651
Just a girl I might, I don't know...

40
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:01,737
ask to go to the movies or something.

41
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:06,033
Nicky, you are turning
into a very handsome young man.

42
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,701
You're going to be
just like your dad.

43
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,119
Honey,

44
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:11,747
can you help me adjust
this servo regulator?

45
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:19,129
Now, if you and Nicky want to get out
by yourselves while I'm gone,

46
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:21,340
the baby-sitter's number's
in the kitchen.

47
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,803
- What's with him?
- I think there's a girl.

48
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:28,305
Nick? Our Nick?

49
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:31,433
You know, he's growing up,
in case you haven't noticed.

50
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:42,236
Uh-oh.

51
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:44,738
- I'll fix it.
- I'll fix you, you little punk!

52
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:45,989
Nick, stop.

53
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:51,078
- Adam, no.
- Sorry, Mama.

54
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:53,789
Yes, I should hope so. Come on.

55
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:58,961
- Oh, man.
- You're getting to be a big boy.

56
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:03,048
How do you keep getting
out of there, anyway?

57
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:06,802
I think maybe we should forget
about the playpen idea.

58
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:08,929
I said I could fix it.

59
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:10,848
I'm not stupid.

60
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:14,852
I never said you were stupid.

61
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:18,105
Taxi's here.

62
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,276
So what's for breakfast?

63
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:23,944
Anything good?

64
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,325
Mmm, fantastic.

65
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:32,786
The taxi's gonna
take mommy to the airport.

66
00:07:33,162 --> 00:07:35,998
And then mommy's gonna show
Amy her new room at school.

67
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:38,876
Hopefully they'll tire him
out at day care.

68
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:41,211
So when I get home,
he'll take a late nap.

69
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:42,838
No nap!

70
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:45,716
Honey, we don't say the "n" word
around two year olds.

71
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:46,884
Adam.

72
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,510
Colored car.

73
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:51,472
Okay, now, Adam's lunch
is in the freezer,

74
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,932
and I put the baby-sitter's number
on the refrigerator.

75
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:55,517
Is there something I'm forgetting?

76
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,686
- I'm sure I'm forgetting something.
- Diane, Diane, relax.

77
00:07:57,853 --> 00:07:59,771
Don't you think
I can handle things around here?

78
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,317
Of course, you can, honey.

79
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:06,778
- Ooh.
- Break it up, guys.

80
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,366
Don't worry, dad. She'll get there
and realize there's nothing to do,

81
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,410
turn around, and come right back.

82
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:15,370
Bye.

83
00:08:17,498 --> 00:08:18,540
Bye, Nick.

84
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:20,375
Come on, Amy,
we got to get going.

85
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:26,673
Oh, don't forget to drop Nick and
Adam off on your way to work.

86
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,050
Gosh, the time.

87
00:08:28,217 --> 00:08:30,260
I got to get you to work.
I got a big test today.

88
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:33,263
- Bye.
- Bye-bye, Mama.

89
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:39,019
Come on, come on.

90
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:42,523
Come on, come on.

91
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:46,318
You can do it. Atta girl.

92
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:59,248
<i>Szalinski test number 1277.</i>

93
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:01,166
<i>Crystal group 5.</i>

94
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,002
Shouldn't we wait for Szalinski?

95
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:06,588
Maybe this will
teach him to be here on time.

96
00:09:07,673 --> 00:09:09,675
Szalinski isn't running the show;
I am.

97
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:15,305
This better work this time,
so concentrate.

98
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:20,269
<i>Nine, eight,
seven, six, five,</i>

99
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:25,274
<i>four, three, two, one, zero.</i>

100
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:40,122
Here.

101
00:09:58,932 --> 00:09:59,933
Sorry, everybody.

102
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,394
There were some large
cumulonimbus clouds blocking the sun

103
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:03,895
and I lost power.

104
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:05,814
And my son got a job for the summer,
Wet and Wild,

105
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:07,190
and I had to drop him off.

106
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,359
What's that stuff on your face?

107
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:14,114
Oh, excuse me, Dr. Hendrickson?

108
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:16,116
I'm sick and tired of this.

109
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:17,951
Now, we have had some success

110
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:21,121
replicating Szalinski's experiments
shrinking matter,

111
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,498
but reversing the process,
enlarging matter,

112
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:26,543
has seen us run up
one blind alley after another.

113
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:30,297
Clifford Sterling demands results.

114
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:32,299
His board of directors
demands results;

115
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:34,676
the United States government
demands results;

116
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:37,054
- and as project director...
- Excuse me, Dr. Hendrickson.

117
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:38,513
I beg your pardon, Wayne.

118
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:41,350
As project co-director,
I intend to deliver results.

119
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:44,144
I've been doing some work,
on my own, on the problem, sir.

120
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:45,395
- Yes, Wayne.
- I think you'll find

121
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,648
- if you look at these calculations...
- Wayne, Wayne, Wayne.

122
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:50,817
When you licensed your device
to Sterling labs,

123
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:53,654
you were promised the finest minds
in the country would be working on it

124
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:54,780
and they are.

125
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:56,448
- I know that, sir.
- Good, good.

126
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,283
But I think
if you look at these notes,

127
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:00,410
you'll find that although...

128
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:31,733
Mandy?

129
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,944
- Yeah, Rick?
- Nick.

130
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:35,278
Nick.

131
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:40,075
Hey, Nick, your dad's
here in his spaceship.

132
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:42,411
- It's the dweeb mobile.
- Here we go again.

133
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:44,579
Hey, Nicky! Want a ride?

134
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,626
Hey, look at the nerdmobile.

135
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:51,628
Oh, man.

136
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:53,213
Have a nice flight.

137
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,175
- Thanks a lot, Dad.
- For what?

138
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:00,262
Nothing.

139
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:04,558
Dad, were you ever
popular in school?

140
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:06,601
You bet.

141
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:09,438
I was president of the astronomy club
two years in a row.

142
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:11,189
We were happenin' guys.

143
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:15,277
So, Mom tells me that...
there's some girl?

144
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:16,445
What?

145
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:21,408
No. No, I.. I was just wondering.

146
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:30,167
How was your flight?

147
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,127
Uh-huh. No, fine.

148
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:34,004
No, we just got home.

149
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,297
We're fixing dinner now.

150
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:42,304
What noise? It was just
a bad connection, that's all.

151
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:46,141
The baby? Well, he's fine.

152
00:12:46,308 --> 00:12:47,559
He's in the playpen.

153
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:49,269
No, I fixed it.

154
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:50,937
He can't get out.

155
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:55,901
- Ice cream.
- How's Amy's dorm?

156
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:58,945
Uh-huh. Yeah.

157
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,364
Hey, stop it.

158
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:04,326
Nothing. Just the dog. Uh-huh.

159
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:06,203
No, everything's fine.

160
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:09,581
Oh, you worry too much.

161
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:12,375
What? The chicken?

162
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:16,004
The chicken you left us
really looks fine, honey.

163
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:25,472
So, I was thinking,
with mom and Amy out of town,

164
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:28,850
that this would give us guys
a chance to talk about the...

165
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:30,685
you know, the birds and the bees.

166
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:39,694
Here, Nicky.

167
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:58,547
You know what I was thinking,
Big Bunny?

168
00:13:58,630 --> 00:13:59,631
What?

169
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:01,967
I was thinking, we got to be
real nice to our brother Nick.

170
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,052
- You know why?
- No, why?

171
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:06,221
Well, because he moved away
to a new place now,

172
00:14:06,388 --> 00:14:08,723
and he's got to make all new
friends, just like me and you.

173
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,350
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

174
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:12,394
- Should we sing a song now?
- Yeah.

175
00:14:12,561 --> 00:14:14,437
- What song should we sing?
- "ABC's."

176
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,439
- How about "Twinkle, twinkle"?
- "ABC."

177
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:18,358
- "ABC"?
- Yeah.

178
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,194
<i>- Twinkle, twinkle...</i>
- "ABC's"!

179
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,654
Let's sing
"Twinkle, twinkle, little star."

180
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:24,114
"ABC's."

181
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:27,909
Okay, first "ABC's."
<i>A-B-C-D-E-F-G, H-I-J-K, L-M-N-O-P</i>

182
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:29,703
Now "Twinkle, twinkle," okay?

183
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:31,538
Okay.

184
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:38,253
<i>Twinkle, twinkle little star</i>

185
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,589
<i>How I won...</i>

186
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:45,093
<i>...der what you are</i>

187
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:48,305
It'll be a hell of a thing
for you, Charles, if it works.

188
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:50,807
It'll work. I'll make it work.

189
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:53,518
Over the years, I've seen
Clifford Sterling attach himself

190
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:56,104
to one crazy idea after another.

191
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:59,024
I have to tell you, the board
of directors is very worried.

192
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,902
Pardon me a moment.

193
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:03,862
Hendrickson.

194
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:05,572
<i>Hello?</i>

195
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,282
What was that?

196
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:09,534
It was a balloon popping,
Dr. Hendrickson.

197
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:11,536
I got the idea
while singing my kid to sleep.

198
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:13,788
You see, if you hit a balloon
with too much force,

199
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:16,625
<i>you don't allow the molecules
time to expand, and the balloon pops.</i>

200
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:17,792
Problem?

201
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:19,210
No. Szalinski.

202
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:20,670
Oh, him.

203
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:25,926
Why Clifford insists on keeping him
involved is absolutely beyond me.

204
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:28,011
If I were running
this project by myself right now,

205
00:15:28,178 --> 00:15:31,056
we'd be neck-deep in apples
the size of Buicks.

206
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:33,516
There are those of us on the board
who agree with you.

207
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:36,478
<i>...Fundamental integrity
of the atomic substructure...</i>

208
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:39,648
Clifford Sterling just may have
outlived his usefulness...

209
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:42,984
to the corporation,
to its stockholders.

210
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:47,238
I should think his successor
would be a foregone conclusion,

211
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:52,285
especially if you're the one
to actually make this thing work.

212
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:55,205
<i>...Thereby allowing
the molecules time to expand...</i>

213
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:58,458
without tearing
the atomic fabric. Hello?

214
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:01,461
Szalinski? Szalinski,

215
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:04,381
<i>why don't you write up this
balloon research of yours?</i>

216
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:06,466
I can do the math and have
it on your desk tomorrow.

217
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,301
No, it's not necessary.

218
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:10,220
All right,
have a good weekend, Szalinski.

219
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:14,641
"Have a good weekend, Szalinski"?

220
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:22,190
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hi, may I please speak to Mandy?

221
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:23,942
<i>Sure. Mandy, phone!</i>

222
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:26,903
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hi, Mandy?

223
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:35,578
I'll fix it.

224
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:37,956
Daddy!

225
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:39,916
Hey, what are you doing up,
little guy?

226
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:44,546
Hey, Nick, want to do
something with me tomorrow?

227
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:46,047
Yeah, sure.

228
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:48,091
Okay. Come on, fella.

229
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:50,010
One more story.

230
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:51,594
Then tomorrow, you want
to come with me and Nicky

231
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:52,721
down to the lab and we'll play?

232
00:16:58,518 --> 00:16:59,811
Okay, guys.

233
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:02,480
See, Adam, this is where daddy works.

234
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:04,774
- Want me to take that?
- Yeah.

235
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:09,696
Got to be a little bit discreet
about this.

236
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:11,114
Huh?

237
00:17:12,991 --> 00:17:14,409
- Mr. Szalinski.
- Hi, Smitty.

238
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:17,787
- Hello. You working today?
- Uh, just gonna tidy up a little.

239
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,255
- Wow.
- Wow.

240
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:29,591
- This is some lab.
- Some lab.

241
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:32,052
Way better than what we had
in the attic, huh?

242
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:34,554
- Way better.
- Way better.

243
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:38,767
Yes, would you connect me
with Dr. Hendrickson please?

244
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:46,066
Call up a command directory labeled
"primary laser drive."

245
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:48,234
Tell me what it says
under "intensity."

246
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:57,285
- It says "access denied."
- Access denied?

247
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:03,500
I got to figure out some way to lower
the intensity of the laser.

248
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:07,670
Hey, Dad.

249
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:12,008
We could diffuse it maybe.

250
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:18,306
That's a good idea.

251
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:26,272
Now, we'll set final target.

252
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:27,982
Target what, Dad?

253
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:35,907
- Hey, can I borrow this, pal?
- No.

254
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:39,828
Come on, let me see if I can make
Big Bunny really big bunny, huh?

255
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:51,881
Yes sir, I thought it was unusual,
him being in here on a Saturday.

256
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:54,634
You did the right thing
letting me know. Thank you.

257
00:18:57,971 --> 00:18:59,681
Well, that's it for me.

258
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,684
Hey, you're gonna have
to wear some glasses.

259
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:04,769
There you go.

260
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:27,041
<i>Thirty seconds.</i>

261
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,130
<i>Twenty-five seconds.</i>

262
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:35,717
<i>Twenty seconds.</i>

263
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:41,139
<i>19, 18, 17, 16...</i>

264
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:44,517
<i>15, 14, 13...</i>

265
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:47,687
<i>12, 11, 10...</i>

266
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:51,858
Nine, eight, seven, six, five...

267
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,943
- Dad!
- Power surge!

268
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:56,988
<i>- Three, two, one...</i>
- Quick, the abort switches!

269
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:10,043
Unable to abort.

270
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:16,049
Joe, what's happening up here?

271
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:36,527
Uh, Mr. Szalinski,
your security clearance

272
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:40,657
denies you access to the equipment
without Dr. Hendrickson's permission.

273
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,534
- You are aware of that, right?
- Yeah, Smitty.

274
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:47,705
Uh, Mr. Szalinski...

275
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:51,834
I'm sorry I had to, uh, uh...

276
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:55,296
That baby of yours...

277
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,298
Sure starting to get big.

278
00:20:58,258 --> 00:20:59,550
See you, Smitty.

279
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:07,767
I'm bigger.

280
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:10,019
Bigger, bigger, bigger.

281
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:12,272
Dad, how come you got to ask
somebody's permission

282
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:13,898
to work on your own invention?

283
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:16,985
Well Nick,
Dad's a member of a team now,

284
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:19,279
and I'm working
with some real talented people.

285
00:21:19,362 --> 00:21:21,030
But, Dad, it's your invention.

286
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:23,366
They didn't have the idea, you did.

287
00:21:50,435 --> 00:21:51,561
OK, bud.

288
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:55,148
Looks like daddy needs to spend
a little quality time with Nick. OK?

289
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:57,025
So, I'm gonna get you a baby-sitter.

290
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:59,068
You're gonna have yourself
a good time.

291
00:21:59,444 --> 00:22:01,696
- Nick.
- Yeah.

292
00:22:07,285 --> 00:22:09,370
You puttin' on
a little bit of weight?

293
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:21,007
I'm big.

294
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:27,513
You know what? Daddy's gonna
make you a nice quick lunch.

295
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,682
Maybe kind of a... low-cal thing.

296
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:32,060
What do you think? Huh?
It's gonna be good.

297
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:34,145
Okay, you know what?

298
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:35,938
Sit down and hang onto him.

299
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:38,566
He'll keep you company,
and I'll make...

300
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:40,693
Uh, baby-sitter,
baby-sitter, baby-sitter.

301
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:46,824
555-5654.

302
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,203
Okay, so... lunches.

303
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,330
Whoa. How about that, huh?

304
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:53,998
Yeah.

305
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:56,042
<i>- Hi, is this Mandy Park?</i>
- Yeah.

306
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:59,629
This is Wayne Szalinski.
Can you come over about 3:30 for us?

307
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:02,465
Uh, 3:30? Sounds okay,
Mr. Schlitzminski.

308
00:23:02,757 --> 00:23:03,966
Szalinski, dear.

309
00:23:04,175 --> 00:23:06,219
Szalinski, right. That's what I said.

310
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:08,346
I, like, charge $2.50 an hour.

311
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:10,306
Unless, of course,
I actually have to do anything

312
00:23:10,431 --> 00:23:14,102
like change diapers or clean up.
In which case, the price goes up.

313
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:17,021
Oh no. All you have to do
is just... just watch him, really.

314
00:23:17,271 --> 00:23:19,273
<i>- Okay, see you at 3:30.</i>
- Okay.

315
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:22,944
Okay.

316
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:26,989
Okay. Are these Quark's or yours?

317
00:23:29,784 --> 00:23:31,744
You just stay here, okay?

318
00:23:32,203 --> 00:23:33,621
She sounded great on the phone.

319
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:36,082
- I want to go a restaurant.
- You want to go to a restaurant?

320
00:23:36,249 --> 00:23:37,917
But, I just made this stuff.
It's gonna be good.

321
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:41,129
I want to go eat in restaurant.

322
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:43,548
Well, I'll be the waiter, okay?

323
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:45,550
And, uh... Let me take your order.

324
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:47,844
- What would you like?
- I want the duck.

325
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:50,763
Duck. The duck
is not very good tonight.

326
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:52,723
Can I recommend the special?

327
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:55,518
- Okay.
- Okay, fine. We have <i>soup du jour.</i>

328
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:58,271
We have hamburger.
We have French fries today.

329
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:00,565
- Would you like 'em?
- Okay.

330
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:03,109
- All right, I'll be right back.
- Okay.

331
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:30,470
Hey, Nick, want to go to a movie?
Just the two of us.

332
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:33,514
Yeah, there's a movie at the Desert 6
I wanted to see.

333
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:36,601
Great. Come on.
It'll take our minds off everything.

334
00:24:36,893 --> 00:24:38,144
I'll check show times.

335
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:39,604
Okay and then maybe afterwards,

336
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:41,105
we can get
a bite to eat or something.

337
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:44,734
Big, Big Bunny.

338
00:24:54,035 --> 00:24:55,161
What's that?

339
00:24:58,164 --> 00:24:59,624
What's gotten into him?

340
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:11,552
Dad, how?

341
00:25:11,636 --> 00:25:13,387
Where were you in the lab
this morning? Were you watching Adam?

342
00:25:13,471 --> 00:25:14,555
He was off to the side.

343
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:16,641
At the moment of discharge,
where was he?

344
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:20,144
Just before, I know,
he was off to the side... wasn't he?

345
00:25:20,645 --> 00:25:22,772
Somehow, I don't think so.

346
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:33,199
Boo.

347
00:25:43,668 --> 00:25:44,794
Don't worry, Adam.

348
00:25:44,961 --> 00:25:46,587
Daddy's going to make
everything okay.

349
00:25:51,551 --> 00:25:54,178
Okay, we got to get him
back to the lab,

350
00:25:54,345 --> 00:25:56,347
analyze the data,
and reverse the process.

351
00:25:56,514 --> 00:25:57,682
- One thing, Dad.
- What?

352
00:25:57,974 --> 00:25:59,725
Do you think the security guard
might get suspicious

353
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,561
with us walking in
with a seven-foot baby?

354
00:26:01,686 --> 00:26:03,729
- Uh-oh.
- Good point.

355
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:33,718
This will cover your
head and your hair.

356
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:35,303
Here, Adam, put this on.

357
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:37,972
There.

358
00:26:38,139 --> 00:26:40,349
He looks like
a badly dressed beekeeper.

359
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:43,060
All right.

360
00:26:43,978 --> 00:26:45,563
Okay. Just act natural.

361
00:26:46,063 --> 00:26:48,149
Come on, bud. Atta boy.

362
00:26:50,693 --> 00:26:55,531
Smitty! I forgot the keys to my van,
and I couldn't start the van.

363
00:26:55,698 --> 00:26:58,743
It's in the lab, but I'm not going
to use anything in there

364
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:01,912
because of my security access thing,
which you mentioned earlier.

365
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:03,998
So I'm just gonna get the keys
from the lab.

366
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:09,128
Adam.

367
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:14,300
Come on, down.

368
00:27:18,012 --> 00:27:19,388
Szalinski.

369
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,806
Go back up.

370
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:23,351
Just stopped by to do
some computations

371
00:27:23,517 --> 00:27:25,936
in the... in the data base.

372
00:27:26,103 --> 00:27:27,938
The data base has been erased.

373
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:29,774
Our entire experiment: gone.

374
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:30,900
Get back! Back!

375
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:32,318
- Erased?
- All 38 gigabytes.

376
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:34,654
- It can't be.
- Sure it can,

377
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,864
if the main controller was trying
to compensate laser intensity

378
00:27:37,031 --> 00:27:39,909
for this, which you jammed
into the filter pack, you idiot

379
00:27:40,076 --> 00:27:43,245
causing a power surge
through the entire main drive system.

380
00:27:43,621 --> 00:27:44,955
Who was that?

381
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,375
- Stop it.
- Who?

382
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:50,211
- The guy in the hat.
- Uh, a friend of mine.

383
00:27:50,503 --> 00:27:52,880
- What language was he speaking?
- Yugoslavian.

384
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:54,840
You let a foreigner into the lab.

385
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:57,343
He's not a foreigner, he's my wife's
uncle Yanosh, from Yugoslavia.

386
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,470
He's family,
and he just wanted to see the lab,

387
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:00,596
and I brought him here.

388
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,640
The man's a genius.
Did you see the size of his head?

389
00:28:02,807 --> 00:28:05,518
225, the I.Q. on that man.
An extended brainpan.

390
00:28:05,685 --> 00:28:07,895
- Extended brainpan?
- Bathroom.

391
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:12,316
- Did he say "bathroom"?
- Bafoom. Yugoslavian.

392
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:14,318
It's a term of... of appreciation.

393
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:17,279
"Bafoom: thank you for bringing
me down here on a Saturday

394
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:18,948
to the lab to look around,"
that's all.

395
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,702
How long before we can restore
the system from the back-ups?

396
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:25,121
That doesn't concern you.
You're off the project.

397
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:28,290
You don't have the authority
to make that decision.

398
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:30,626
Well, maybe I don't. So why don't you
call Clifford Sterling personally

399
00:28:30,793 --> 00:28:32,002
and plead your case.

400
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:34,130
However,
after this morning's little escapade

401
00:28:34,255 --> 00:28:35,923
and the time and money
it will cost Sterling Labs,

402
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:38,050
I don't think the old man will
have a great deal of sympathy.

403
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:39,969
I hope you'll spare yourself
the embarrassment

404
00:28:40,136 --> 00:28:41,512
of having to be escorted...

405
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:42,763
to the gate.

406
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,146
Start working data
restoration backwards,

407
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:54,358
from 8:56 this morning
to the exact time the system crashed.

408
00:28:54,734 --> 00:28:57,278
I want to know what he was up to.

409
00:29:05,202 --> 00:29:06,787
Why didn't you tell 'em, Dad?

410
00:29:07,163 --> 00:29:09,248
I mean, at least then they'd know
that you were able to make it work

411
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:10,750
when nobody else could.

412
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:14,670
Look, Nick, remember we made you kids
promise never ever to tell anyone

413
00:29:14,837 --> 00:29:16,839
you were accidentally shrunk
and lost for two days?

414
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:17,840
Yeah.

415
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:20,092
That's because we didn't want
you guys to become specimens,

416
00:29:20,217 --> 00:29:23,262
to undergo countless tests,
to go through endless observations,

417
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:24,764
and who knows what else.

418
00:29:26,182 --> 00:29:28,392
What about Adam?
What are we going to do?

419
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:31,562
I don't know.

420
00:29:32,605 --> 00:29:34,398
What I do know is:

421
00:29:34,857 --> 00:29:38,319
we got to figure some way to fix this
before your mother gets home.

422
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:46,744
Hi, guys. I'm home!

423
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:49,914
Where'd this come from?

424
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,175
What do we do?

425
00:30:01,509 --> 00:30:02,593
I don't know.

426
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:06,388
We could drive to Mexico,
Dad, and hide out.

427
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:09,141
Come back when he's bigger.
I mean older.

428
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:12,228
- Maybe she wouldn't notice then.
- No.

429
00:30:13,687 --> 00:30:15,397
Honesty's the best policy, Nick.

430
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:18,484
I'll just... explain.

431
00:30:19,568 --> 00:30:20,611
Sure.

432
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,905
It's not the first time
something like this has happened...

433
00:30:23,614 --> 00:30:24,865
...to our family.

434
00:30:26,075 --> 00:30:27,368
I'll just tell the truth.

435
00:30:27,952 --> 00:30:31,455
- Then beg for mercy.
- Colored car.

436
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:46,220
- What was that all about?
- Umm...

437
00:30:46,387 --> 00:30:47,888
I had a little trouble with the van.

438
00:30:47,972 --> 00:30:51,809
I thought I put it in park,
and it went into reverse

439
00:30:51,976 --> 00:30:54,687
'cause the "p" and the "r"
look... You're back early.

440
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:55,604
Come on, big guy.

441
00:30:55,688 --> 00:30:59,149
Yeah, I took a cab from the airport.
You know, it really was silly.

442
00:30:59,275 --> 00:31:00,818
Amy didn't need me at all.

443
00:31:00,985 --> 00:31:03,112
Who's the man
in the loud sport coat?

444
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:04,446
No. No, those are Nick's.

445
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:07,074
Well Diane, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

446
00:31:07,408 --> 00:31:10,077
- Sit down. Sit down!
- Mom.

447
00:31:10,286 --> 00:31:13,831
You know how sometimes
the things that I invent

448
00:31:13,998 --> 00:31:16,208
don't always work
the way they're supposed to?

449
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,586
Sweetheart. You can tell me.

450
00:31:18,836 --> 00:31:20,170
How bad can it be?

451
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,089
After all,

452
00:31:22,256 --> 00:31:24,758
it's not like you did something
to one of the kids again.

453
00:31:27,261 --> 00:31:30,347
- Wayne, where is Adam?
- Well, uh...

454
00:31:30,514 --> 00:31:32,141
Who is that man in the van?

455
00:31:32,725 --> 00:31:34,935
And where did this bunny come from?

456
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:38,188
- All right, I confess! I did it!
- Did what?

457
00:31:38,689 --> 00:31:40,274
Peekaboo!

458
00:31:41,901 --> 00:31:43,360
I blew up the baby.

459
00:31:45,696 --> 00:31:48,073
Mama fall down.

460
00:31:48,324 --> 00:31:49,575
Mama?

461
00:31:50,701 --> 00:31:52,745
- How'd she take it?
- About like usual.

462
00:31:53,287 --> 00:31:54,663
Mama sleeping?

463
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:56,916
I'll kill Wayne.

464
00:31:57,791 --> 00:31:58,918
You don't want to kill Wayne.

465
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:01,128
I want to kill Wayne.

466
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,671
What's he doing?

467
00:32:03,005 --> 00:32:04,590
He's playing with his toys.

468
00:32:04,757 --> 00:32:06,175
Well, make him stop.

469
00:32:08,302 --> 00:32:10,346
"Make him stop."

470
00:32:12,723 --> 00:32:15,142
Why didn't I think of that?

471
00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:17,353
Adam.

472
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,855
Adam, stop fooling around!

473
00:32:20,022 --> 00:32:22,191
- Catch.
- Adam.

474
00:32:22,483 --> 00:32:25,861
- That was a real rocket.
- Let's go for a walk, Adam.

475
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:28,447
- Play ball, Nick.
- Don't throw things at Nick!

476
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:30,032
Catch it, play ball.

477
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:31,241
This is your last warning.

478
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:35,913
Okay, I'll give you
one more warning.

479
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:47,216
Shh. It's not as bad as it seems.

480
00:32:47,424 --> 00:32:49,343
It almost couldn't be, could it?

481
00:32:51,095 --> 00:32:53,097
Well, I finally got him in his room.

482
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:57,226
Tell him to stay inside,
and close the door.

483
00:32:57,393 --> 00:33:00,187
I did close the door.

484
00:33:01,188 --> 00:33:02,481
He just opened his door.

485
00:33:05,234 --> 00:33:07,736
- And he decided to share it with us.
- I break off.

486
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:09,405
Oh, baby.

487
00:33:09,822 --> 00:33:12,074
Adam, put the door down, sweetheart.

488
00:33:12,241 --> 00:33:14,034
Why don't you give
the door to daddy, Adam?

489
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:17,413
- Give daddy the door, Adam.
- I fix it, I fix it.

490
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:20,666
Wait till the Vista del Mar
standards committee sees this.

491
00:33:22,793 --> 00:33:25,587
Maybe we shouldn't bother.
It's just a mailbox.

492
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:28,716
Little things have a way of
becoming very big things, Patty.

493
00:33:29,466 --> 00:33:31,844
- Let go of the door, Adam.
- No, my door.

494
00:33:31,969 --> 00:33:34,054
- Stop before someone gets hurt.
- Let go!

495
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:46,984
I fix it!

496
00:33:47,151 --> 00:33:50,863
Don't fix it, Adam. Just
put down mommy's coffee table.

497
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:54,366
- Be careful, baby.
- Slow down, Adam. Adam, Adam.

498
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:56,493
Ooh.

499
00:33:56,577 --> 00:33:58,037
- Gentle, gentle.
- Not my antique chair!

500
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,664
They remodeling in there?

501
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:02,416
Come back. Come back here.

502
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:05,335
Adam. Adam!

503
00:34:07,004 --> 00:34:08,464
Adam, sit down.

504
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:10,841
- He's on this side.
- Stop him, Dad. He's yours.

505
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:13,260
- Oh, Adam!
- This is not a game.

506
00:34:13,427 --> 00:34:15,012
What do we do when we catch him?

507
00:34:15,137 --> 00:34:16,346
Adam, hang on!

508
00:34:16,764 --> 00:34:20,017
Okay, okay. You guys go that way.
I'll go this way.

509
00:34:23,145 --> 00:34:25,022
Hi, little guy.

510
00:34:26,315 --> 00:34:27,816
Adam, put daddy down!

511
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:29,359
Adam, put daddy down!

512
00:34:32,529 --> 00:34:34,573
- Guitar.
- Not my room!

513
00:34:35,616 --> 00:34:38,869
Adam. Adam, put down my guitar.
Put it down.

514
00:34:39,078 --> 00:34:41,163
Get back here. Get back.

515
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:43,540
- That's enough, fellas. Stop.
- Adam, sweetheart.

516
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:46,627
- He's got my guitar!
- Nicky, he's just a baby.

517
00:34:46,794 --> 00:34:48,796
He's not a baby.
He's a monster.

518
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:53,425
He's going to break my guitar!

519
00:34:55,094 --> 00:34:58,013
- Come back here.
- Give me back my guitar!

520
00:34:58,305 --> 00:35:00,265
Give it back, you brat!

521
00:35:01,809 --> 00:35:02,976
Other way.

522
00:35:04,353 --> 00:35:06,897
- Guitar all gone.
- Got it. Here, hide it.

523
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:12,653
He targeted something.

524
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:14,780
It's gonna take a lot more enhancing
to figure out what.

525
00:35:14,947 --> 00:35:16,198
I can do it.

526
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:19,034
What do you suppose this is here?

527
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:21,578
- Condensation on the lens?
- Nah, it's much too solid.

528
00:35:21,995 --> 00:35:24,623
- How can you be sure?
- I'm sure. It's not amorphous.

529
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:26,291
It's a mass. I can see.

530
00:35:28,127 --> 00:35:29,461
Play in here with daddy.

531
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:32,840
- Play what?
- Play anything.

532
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:34,550
- This should distract him.
- Great!

533
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:49,398
Dance, Adam.

534
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:52,818
Good, do some more.

535
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:54,862
Isn't this fun, Wayne?

536
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:57,281
Adam, clap your hands.
Clap your hands.

537
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:01,118
Put your foot in.

538
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:04,621
Why are you closing the shutters?

539
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:06,874
So one of the neighbors doesn't
look in, see a seven-foot baby,

540
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,458
and call "The National Enquirer."

541
00:36:10,127 --> 00:36:11,378
- Doorbell.
- Who's that?

542
00:36:11,545 --> 00:36:12,671
One of the neighbors.

543
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:14,840
So far, your plan's
working perfectly.

544
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:18,093
Hi.

545
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:22,139
Hello. We heard shouting
and a lot of noise,

546
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:24,892
so we were wondering
if everything was all right.

547
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:27,519
Oh, yes, everything's fine.

548
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:29,479
We were just entertaining.

549
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:30,689
Uncle Yanosh.

550
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:32,316
Uncle Yanersh.

551
00:36:34,902 --> 00:36:36,820
Not too hard.
You're denting the floor!

552
00:36:36,987 --> 00:36:39,656
- Bye.
- Dad, help me. He's got me.

553
00:36:40,032 --> 00:36:41,533
He's breaking my ribs.

554
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:43,410
Don't do that, Adam.

555
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:48,207
My God, it appears
to have three eyes.

556
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:50,500
A new life-form of some sort?

557
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:52,461
Try scaling up the window.

558
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:56,089
This could be big.

559
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:57,883
These could be very big.

560
00:37:01,845 --> 00:37:03,847
Well, I think you did
a great job with these.

561
00:37:04,514 --> 00:37:05,807
This should really distract him.

562
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:09,353
- Well, he likes noise.
- Here you go, honey.

563
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:11,063
Yeah.

564
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:13,941
You know what, Nicky?
I don't care what you say.

565
00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:16,944
It's still a playpen,
and a playpen's a playpen to Adam.

566
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:21,031
Yeah, but you have to admit Mom,
not many guys could come up

567
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:22,783
with something like this
in half an hour.

568
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:26,578
- Cuckoo.
- No, no, Adam!

569
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:28,914
Sweetheart, stay away from that.

570
00:37:29,081 --> 00:37:30,874
Adam, please don't touch that.

571
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:33,543
Adam, no, don't touch mommy's cuckoo.

572
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:35,587
Come on away from there, Adam.

573
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:37,756
Come over here, and play with Nicky.

574
00:37:38,465 --> 00:37:39,800
Play with Nicky, Adam.

575
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:43,804
When you get a minute,
you might take a look at this.

576
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:47,432
Wayne?

577
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,144
Well... some of the numbers indicate
that on an atomic...

578
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:53,647
Please, honey, the truth, okay?

579
00:37:54,815 --> 00:37:57,234
The truth, Diane, is that without
access to the data at the plant,

580
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:59,278
I don't know
that there's anything I can do.

581
00:37:59,987 --> 00:38:01,989
I know what's happening,
but I don't know why.

582
00:38:03,824 --> 00:38:04,825
I'm sorry, honey.

583
00:38:04,992 --> 00:38:07,119
Hey Mom, look I finally found
a way to keep him quiet.

584
00:38:07,995 --> 00:38:10,038
There were 12 ice-cream bars
in there.

585
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:15,419
Well, he's ruined his dinner.

586
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:17,212
Not necessarily, Mom.

587
00:38:17,379 --> 00:38:20,048
At his body weight,
he should be able to metabolize...

588
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:22,884
Maybe I should just shut up about it.

589
00:38:26,555 --> 00:38:28,307
Okay, boys, we're going out.

590
00:38:30,309 --> 00:38:32,769
- Diane, what are you doing?
- I'm taking him to the lab.

591
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:34,980
Maybe there's somebody there who...

592
00:38:35,147 --> 00:38:36,523
Who knows what they're doing?

593
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,900
I didn't mean it
like that.

594
00:38:38,984 --> 00:38:42,112
I'm sorry,
but all I care about right now

595
00:38:42,237 --> 00:38:44,489
is getting my baby
to shrink back to normal size.

596
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,825
Come on, Nicky,
help me get him out to the van.

597
00:38:47,034 --> 00:38:49,244
Shrink?
Diane, wait! I got an idea.

598
00:38:49,745 --> 00:38:51,997
My original machine.
it's in the lab security warehouse.

599
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:53,999
Yes!

600
00:38:54,166 --> 00:38:55,959
This'll have to be
a covert operation.

601
00:38:56,126 --> 00:38:59,296
Diane, you come with me.
Nick, you stay with... the baby.

602
00:38:59,463 --> 00:39:01,590
Oh no!
We are not leaving them here alone.

603
00:39:01,757 --> 00:39:03,258
Diane, you can't take him to the lab.

604
00:39:03,425 --> 00:39:06,053
There's no telling what Hendrickson
will do if he gets his hands on him.

605
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:08,096
Look at him, he's exhausted.

606
00:39:08,764 --> 00:39:10,140
He can take a nap while we're gone.

607
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:11,350
No nap!

608
00:39:15,312 --> 00:39:16,688
Look who I got:

609
00:39:17,481 --> 00:39:18,982
really Big Bunny.

610
00:39:21,068 --> 00:39:22,152
Hi, Adam.

611
00:39:22,361 --> 00:39:23,487
Hello, Adam.

612
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:25,489
You're real tired, aren't you Adam?

613
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:28,575
Yeah, he looks real tired to me.

614
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:30,994
Should we sing the song?

615
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:35,707
<i>Twinkle, twinkle little star</i>

616
00:39:36,249 --> 00:39:40,087
<i>How I wonder what you are</i>

617
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:44,424
<i>Up above the world so high</i>

618
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:48,553
<i>Like a diamond in the sky</i>

619
00:39:48,929 --> 00:39:52,891
<i>Twinkle, twinkle little star</i>

620
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:55,394
<i>- How I won...</i>
- Mine!

621
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,561
- Let go!
- Gimme.

622
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:59,189
Adam Szalinski,
you let go of that bunny right now!

623
00:39:59,356 --> 00:40:00,941
Put daddy down, Adam.

624
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:02,692
It's not nice to hurt daddy.

625
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:04,444
Sorry, Mama.

626
00:40:04,611 --> 00:40:06,738
Okay, I'm bringing up
the structural overlay.

627
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:10,951
Dr. Hendrickson,
we can make out hair, bone and metal,

628
00:40:11,118 --> 00:40:12,494
all sort of intertwined.

629
00:40:12,869 --> 00:40:15,330
I think you should
take a look at this. Yes, sir.

630
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:17,207
He's on his way.

631
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:19,167
We'll show him
the keratin analysis first.

632
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:21,837
- Structural overlay first.
- It's not clear enough.

633
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:24,673
- I think it is.
- Why don't we see what he thinks?

634
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:37,144
Don't worry.
We'll be back in an hour.

635
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:38,728
- Come on.
- Bye-bye.

636
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:42,542
This is our latest image,

637
00:41:42,751 --> 00:41:44,920
superimposing structural
and keratin analysis.

638
00:41:45,086 --> 00:41:48,089
- As you can see, there appears to...
- All right, just move over.

639
00:41:51,051 --> 00:41:52,928
It's a baby
and a stuffed bunny.

640
00:41:55,889 --> 00:41:57,057
Szalinski.

641
00:41:58,016 --> 00:42:00,352
I'm going to pay him a little visit.

642
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:02,479
Back to work.

643
00:42:02,646 --> 00:42:05,106
I knew it was a baby.
I just wasn't sure it was a bunny.

644
00:42:28,922 --> 00:42:30,131
This'll just take a second.

645
00:42:30,298 --> 00:42:32,008
They stored all my stuff
in one large crate.

646
00:42:32,175 --> 00:42:34,636
- It should be easy to spot.
- Oh, Wayne?

647
00:42:40,392 --> 00:42:42,269
Maybe it's in alphabetical order
or something.

648
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:44,271
What if it's not?

649
00:42:44,563 --> 00:42:46,856
All I wanted to do
was take Nick to the movies.

650
00:42:47,524 --> 00:42:48,984
Uh-oh.
- What?

651
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:12,757
Doorbell.

652
00:43:18,638 --> 00:43:22,309
<i>Twinkle, twinkle little...</i>

653
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:25,937
Bunny.

654
00:43:26,062 --> 00:43:27,606
Wait here!

655
00:43:40,452 --> 00:43:41,620
- Mandy.
- Rick.

656
00:43:42,704 --> 00:43:44,956
Nick. Nick Szalinski.

657
00:43:45,749 --> 00:43:47,709
Right.
I'm here to baby-sit.

658
00:43:49,544 --> 00:43:50,712
We don't need a baby-sitter.

659
00:43:53,632 --> 00:43:54,674
Adam, no!

660
00:43:57,761 --> 00:44:00,805
Very funny. Can I come in?
I'm already charging you.

661
00:44:01,514 --> 00:44:04,392
We changed our mind. That's all.
We don't need a baby-sitter.

662
00:44:05,185 --> 00:44:06,353
I don't think so.

663
00:44:06,686 --> 00:44:09,481
Look, I was promised
three hours at $2.50 an hour.

664
00:44:09,648 --> 00:44:11,066
Plus, the extra if I'm grossed out.

665
00:44:11,441 --> 00:44:14,235
Uh, listen, Mandy, take it from me,
you don't want to baby-sit.

666
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:15,403
Not this baby.

667
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:18,198
I'm really sure I can
handle some stupid baby.

668
00:44:34,464 --> 00:44:36,424
Wayne, we've gotta
get back to the kids.

669
00:44:36,591 --> 00:44:38,301
This is just taking too long.

670
00:44:47,394 --> 00:44:49,604
Honey, it's up here!

671
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:52,065
See if you can find a forklift.

672
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:57,570
Mandy, believe me,
I have everything under control.

673
00:44:58,655 --> 00:45:00,073
Now if you promise not to scream,

674
00:45:00,782 --> 00:45:01,991
I'll take the gag out of your mouth.

675
00:45:02,992 --> 00:45:04,035
Promise?

676
00:45:06,788 --> 00:45:08,832
- Help me! Someone help me!
- Mandy!

677
00:45:08,998 --> 00:45:11,251
Please, someone help me!
Giant baby!

678
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:14,295
- You're scaring him.
- Out of my way! Please!

679
00:45:14,421 --> 00:45:16,464
- Mandy, calm down.
- Help me!

680
00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:19,843
What's that?

681
00:45:19,926 --> 00:45:22,512
Help! Help! Help! Help!
Giant baby!

682
00:45:22,721 --> 00:45:24,222
- Help! Giant baby!
- The Slitzitskis.

683
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:32,272
Wayne this is a solar van.
We're inside.

684
00:45:32,439 --> 00:45:34,023
There's a switch marked "batteries".

685
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:36,317
Just be careful not to switch it to-

686
00:45:36,443 --> 00:45:38,027
- Whoa!
- High.

687
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:46,828
No! No!

688
00:45:53,585 --> 00:45:54,794
Hold on!

689
00:45:57,964 --> 00:45:59,257
Can we try again?

690
00:46:05,972 --> 00:46:07,056
Good.

691
00:46:07,348 --> 00:46:08,850
Now despite what he looks like,

692
00:46:09,225 --> 00:46:10,685
Adam is just a little kid.

693
00:46:11,311 --> 00:46:13,646
He's in there watching TV,
not hurting anyone.

694
00:46:14,439 --> 00:46:16,816
<i>Summertime.
The active woman.</i>

695
00:46:19,652 --> 00:46:21,529
<i>She knows what it is
to have a headache.</i>

696
00:46:27,786 --> 00:46:29,037
<i>Let's welcome 'em.</i>

697
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:31,164
<i>Again!</i>

698
00:46:35,168 --> 00:46:36,711
<i>Wiggle that butt!</i>

699
00:46:36,878 --> 00:46:37,962
Sorry.

700
00:46:48,681 --> 00:46:51,351
So, two years ago, he made
you and your sister tiny.

701
00:46:51,851 --> 00:46:53,144
And the guys next door.

702
00:46:53,561 --> 00:46:55,188
Then he made you regular size again.

703
00:46:55,355 --> 00:46:57,398
And now
he's made your baby brother big.

704
00:46:57,524 --> 00:46:58,483
Right.

705
00:47:01,903 --> 00:47:03,822
And you don't, like, think
that's unusual.

706
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:13,289
Oh, my God, he's out and he's bigger.

707
00:47:14,874 --> 00:47:17,877
- You got to help me, okay?
- This wasn't in the job description.

708
00:47:18,044 --> 00:47:20,505
- We'll pay you overtime.
- Okay.

709
00:47:24,843 --> 00:47:27,220
There's no way I'm changing
those diapers.

710
00:47:27,387 --> 00:47:28,471
Come on.

711
00:47:29,848 --> 00:47:34,269
Adam! Adam!

712
00:47:36,688 --> 00:47:38,189
Adam, where are you?

713
00:47:39,941 --> 00:47:41,025
Come on!

714
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:43,570
Julia, be quiet and sit down.

715
00:47:43,736 --> 00:47:47,282
Now for the famous
Chinese blocks trick.

716
00:47:48,032 --> 00:47:49,033
Shazam.

717
00:47:52,453 --> 00:47:53,454
Okay.

718
00:47:53,997 --> 00:47:55,290
Now for my next trick.

719
00:47:58,042 --> 00:47:59,294
Adam!

720
00:48:01,588 --> 00:48:04,382
Now for the disappearing
bunny trick.

721
00:48:04,549 --> 00:48:07,969
Watch carefully. The hand
is quicker than the eye.

722
00:48:08,678 --> 00:48:10,096
Shazam.

723
00:48:10,597 --> 00:48:12,682
Can anyone tell me
where the bunny is?

724
00:48:12,849 --> 00:48:15,393
- There!
- You think it's still on my head?

725
00:48:18,563 --> 00:48:20,732
Big Bunny.

726
00:48:31,117 --> 00:48:32,285
Bye.

727
00:48:34,746 --> 00:48:35,914
There he is! Come on!

728
00:48:36,164 --> 00:48:38,249
I don't care if Clifford's
at the Rand Institute this weekend.

729
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:39,792
I want him notified.

730
00:48:39,959 --> 00:48:41,502
I also want
the board of directors in on this.

731
00:48:41,628 --> 00:48:43,463
Hey! What the...

732
00:48:47,258 --> 00:48:48,927
Contact the Federal Marshals.
Get them out here.

733
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:51,095
I want something large enough
to hold...

734
00:48:51,387 --> 00:48:52,805
To hold something large.

735
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:59,812
Big Bunny.

736
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:01,731
Big, big, Big Bunny.

737
00:49:01,898 --> 00:49:03,983
Big trouble.

738
00:49:05,735 --> 00:49:07,362
Stop where you were right there.

739
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:09,906
I'm just the baby-sitter.

740
00:49:22,627 --> 00:49:24,462
Yeah, an hour tops. Sure.

741
00:49:25,088 --> 00:49:27,757
- Wayne, how's it coming?
- Just about got it, honey.

742
00:49:27,924 --> 00:49:30,259
Hold on. I'm taking a shortcut.

743
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:46,567
Oh.

744
00:49:48,069 --> 00:49:49,320
What do I do?

745
00:49:51,572 --> 00:49:53,950
Okay, let's see
if this thing works.

746
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:08,381
Wayne Szalinski, you unshrink
those policemen right now.

747
00:50:29,318 --> 00:50:30,236
It works!

748
00:50:35,867 --> 00:50:36,993
They're getting away.

749
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:39,162
I think they're
out of our jurisdiction.

750
00:50:45,293 --> 00:50:46,878
Hold it. You can't go in.

751
00:50:47,045 --> 00:50:48,838
It's okay, Officer.
That's our house.

752
00:50:56,763 --> 00:50:58,181
Excuse me.

753
00:50:59,265 --> 00:51:01,059
Where are my boys?
Where are they?

754
00:51:01,142 --> 00:51:02,518
Hold it, hold it.
Just a minute.

755
00:51:02,769 --> 00:51:04,103
Preston Brooks, U.S. Marshals.

756
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:07,190
Now, we found this guy
down the street, hiding in a garage.

757
00:51:07,398 --> 00:51:09,317
The children are perfectly safe,
Mrs. Szalinski.

758
00:51:09,484 --> 00:51:10,902
We just needed to get
the baby some more room,

759
00:51:11,069 --> 00:51:12,153
so he wouldn't hurt himself.

760
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,322
Of course, the mutated child will
have to undergo immediate testing.

761
00:51:14,489 --> 00:51:16,199
That's my kid you're talking about!

762
00:51:16,365 --> 00:51:17,700
Let go of me!

763
00:51:17,867 --> 00:51:21,037
- Hold on, Mr. Szalinski.
- Let go of me.

764
00:51:28,002 --> 00:51:29,462
You can't keep him in that truck.

765
00:51:30,254 --> 00:51:32,090
Don't worry. It's all fixed up.

766
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:35,093
As far as your brother's concerned,
it's one big playpen.

767
00:51:35,343 --> 00:51:37,887
- That's what I mean.
- I'd listen to him if I were you.

768
00:51:38,221 --> 00:51:40,264
Look, miss, when I want your opinion,
I'll ask for it.

769
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:44,769
Mama, help!

770
00:51:45,812 --> 00:51:47,730
Out! Out!

771
00:51:55,738 --> 00:51:58,449
He's got a 40-inch neck.

772
00:51:59,575 --> 00:52:01,577
Adam's going to be fine, Quark.
I know it.

773
00:52:01,744 --> 00:52:02,912
The parents are here.

774
00:52:03,079 --> 00:52:05,540
We'll bring them to meet the child
when he's secure.

775
00:52:06,749 --> 00:52:08,417
I can authorize that!

776
00:52:08,835 --> 00:52:09,877
Marshal Brooks?

777
00:52:10,128 --> 00:52:12,547
I'm afraid I have to insist
that these two be taken into custody.

778
00:52:12,713 --> 00:52:16,092
- On what charge?
- Theft. Malicious mischief.

779
00:52:16,259 --> 00:52:17,718
Child endangerment.

780
00:52:24,016 --> 00:52:25,518
If you'll excuse me.

781
00:52:29,772 --> 00:52:30,940
Clifford.

782
00:52:32,316 --> 00:52:33,568
Well, I hardly know what to say.

783
00:52:34,235 --> 00:52:36,863
I tried to warn you about Szalinski
from the very beginning.

784
00:52:37,029 --> 00:52:38,990
Yes, you did, Charles.

785
00:52:39,365 --> 00:52:41,075
And if it's any consolation to you,
the board of directors

786
00:52:41,242 --> 00:52:42,910
believes that you were right
all along.

787
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:46,330
Dr. Sterling! Dr. Sterling, sir,
I can reverse my son's growth.

788
00:52:46,455 --> 00:52:48,416
Just give me a chance, sir.
I can get him back to normal.

789
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:49,834
- You can?
- With what, Szalinski?

790
00:52:50,001 --> 00:52:51,210
Coca-Cola bottles?

791
00:52:51,836 --> 00:52:54,714
Hmm? Maybe some
chewing gum and twine?

792
00:52:55,047 --> 00:52:57,550
Just who do you think you are,
talking to him like that?

793
00:52:57,717 --> 00:52:58,759
Diane, let me handle this.

794
00:52:58,885 --> 00:53:00,428
Who do you think you are,
talking to me like that?

795
00:53:00,595 --> 00:53:03,639
Clifford, the situation demands
that I bring in the people

796
00:53:03,764 --> 00:53:06,267
with the expertise
and the credentials.

797
00:53:07,059 --> 00:53:10,146
Wait a second, you think I'm just
some guy from Fresno

798
00:53:10,313 --> 00:53:12,481
who tinkered with crackpot ideas
in his attic?

799
00:53:13,274 --> 00:53:14,567
Well, let me tell you something.

800
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:17,361
This whole country is built
on the shoulders of people

801
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:19,238
who tinkered with crackpot ideas

802
00:53:19,405 --> 00:53:21,449
in attics and basements
and backyards.

803
00:53:21,616 --> 00:53:24,035
Alexander Graham Bell
working in a two-room flat.

804
00:53:24,202 --> 00:53:25,870
Young man, don't presume

805
00:53:25,995 --> 00:53:28,164
to stand there and lecture me
about great minds

806
00:53:28,414 --> 00:53:29,498
and great inventors.

807
00:53:30,374 --> 00:53:33,211
Whatever I've been over the years,
I've never been a fool...

808
00:53:33,502 --> 00:53:36,172
or been involved
with anyone else who is.

809
00:53:36,422 --> 00:53:38,633
I certainly don't intend
to start now.

810
00:53:39,926 --> 00:53:41,177
- Charles?
- Yes, Clifford?

811
00:53:41,344 --> 00:53:43,054
- You're fired.
- What?

812
00:53:43,346 --> 00:53:44,347
You're fired.

813
00:53:48,643 --> 00:53:50,186
So Szalinski, what have you
got in mind

814
00:53:50,353 --> 00:53:53,397
so we can get that kid of yours
back to normal size by bedtime?

815
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:54,857
Well sir, the prototype's
in the van...

816
00:53:55,024 --> 00:53:57,026
Hold on folks. We've got a problem.

817
00:53:57,777 --> 00:54:00,738
Your son's escaped,
and he's over 50 feet tall.

818
00:54:01,113 --> 00:54:03,574
That's impossible.
My son's only 14 feet tall.

819
00:54:03,866 --> 00:54:05,785
- I'll drive.
- That's still pretty tall.

820
00:54:08,537 --> 00:54:09,914
Yes, get me Terence Wheeler.

821
00:54:10,081 --> 00:54:11,540
This is an emergency.

822
00:54:13,334 --> 00:54:14,752
<i>He broke out?</i>

823
00:54:15,169 --> 00:54:17,255
He busted out of the truck
and knocked it completely over.

824
00:54:17,421 --> 00:54:18,464
<i>What's he doing now?</i>

825
00:54:18,631 --> 00:54:20,800
He's just standing there.
But he's smiling.

826
00:54:20,967 --> 00:54:21,968
Adam, sit down.

827
00:54:22,134 --> 00:54:23,803
Nick, I don't think sitting's
such a good idea.

828
00:54:23,970 --> 00:54:25,805
Ooh, toys.

829
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:28,432
He did what?

830
00:54:28,891 --> 00:54:32,019
Put your son and the baby-sitter
in his pocket and left.

831
00:54:32,186 --> 00:54:33,020
He's always doing that.

832
00:54:33,062 --> 00:54:34,438
I find the strangest things
in his pockets.

833
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:37,191
Wayne, what do you suppose
is causing this growth phenomenon?

834
00:54:37,358 --> 00:54:38,567
I don't know.

835
00:54:38,776 --> 00:54:41,237
They were transporting him
along Copper Mine Road.

836
00:54:41,737 --> 00:54:43,656
That runs alongside
high-voltage lines.

837
00:54:43,781 --> 00:54:44,782
Oh?

838
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:47,243
Yesterday, when I gave him lunch,
he was right near the microwave oven.

839
00:54:47,410 --> 00:54:50,079
And, you said the baby grew
while he was watching TV.

840
00:54:50,371 --> 00:54:52,665
- Of course!
- I don't understand any of this.

841
00:54:52,832 --> 00:54:54,667
Electromagnetic flux.

842
00:54:54,834 --> 00:54:56,544
Around every
operating electrical device,

843
00:54:56,711 --> 00:54:58,129
there's a flux.

844
00:54:58,296 --> 00:54:59,964
Like an electromagnetic force field.

845
00:55:00,131 --> 00:55:02,008
That's what's causing
the baby to grow.

846
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:04,385
Would this electromagnetic...

847
00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:06,762
would it surround
neon lights, too?

848
00:55:06,846 --> 00:55:07,930
Yeah, why?

849
00:55:08,014 --> 00:55:11,142
Your kid...
He's headed toward Las Vegas.

850
00:55:12,101 --> 00:55:13,477
Uh-oh.

851
00:55:18,566 --> 00:55:20,860
You are not fired,
not by a long shot.

852
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:22,903
This is the opportunity
I've been waiting for.

853
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:25,906
At last, Sterling has gone
too far this time.

854
00:55:29,618 --> 00:55:31,412
The board
is getting together tonight.

855
00:55:31,579 --> 00:55:33,205
Until then, I want you on this.

856
00:55:33,372 --> 00:55:36,000
Whatever it takes,
just get the situation under control.

857
00:55:36,167 --> 00:55:39,378
I did have one thought, sir,
but I'll need military cooperation.

858
00:55:39,503 --> 00:55:40,713
Fine, I'll get the clearance.

859
00:55:40,921 --> 00:55:42,631
Charles, just...
just handle this for us.

860
00:55:42,757 --> 00:55:45,384
We'll... we'll do
the right thing by you.

861
00:56:03,694 --> 00:56:04,904
<i>Police reports just in say</i>

862
00:56:05,029 --> 00:56:07,198
<i>that some kind of large creature
has just escaped</i>

863
00:56:07,281 --> 00:56:09,950
<i>from a government caravan
and is heading toward the city.</i>

864
00:56:16,082 --> 00:56:18,000
Mrs. Szalinski,
if he heads for the lights,

865
00:56:18,167 --> 00:56:19,585
he has to come this way.

866
00:56:20,086 --> 00:56:21,337
According to my calculations,

867
00:56:21,504 --> 00:56:23,255
he's gotta hold still
for 12.2 seconds.

868
00:56:23,422 --> 00:56:24,423
What?

869
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:26,884
His increased mass requires a longer
period of exposure.

870
00:56:27,051 --> 00:56:28,469
How do you expect
to get a two-year-old

871
00:56:28,636 --> 00:56:30,930
to hold still
for 12 point anything seconds?

872
00:56:31,097 --> 00:56:32,223
She's right, Doctor.

873
00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:34,809
We tried to have his picture
taken a month ago. Total bust.

874
00:56:34,975 --> 00:56:36,519
We're just
pulling up now, Dan.

875
00:56:36,685 --> 00:56:38,270
There are
a lot of police cars gathered.

876
00:56:38,437 --> 00:56:39,688
We'll find out what going on.

877
00:56:40,481 --> 00:56:42,066
Call the paramedics now!

878
00:56:42,817 --> 00:56:44,819
All right, here's a shot. Okay.

879
00:56:46,028 --> 00:56:48,572
This is Constance Winters
reporting live from the site

880
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:49,949
of what will certainly become

881
00:56:50,074 --> 00:56:52,493
the most important news story
of the decade.

882
00:56:52,952 --> 00:56:55,830
Dan, I'm seeing a giant...

883
00:57:01,335 --> 00:57:02,503
Oh, my God.

884
00:57:09,844 --> 00:57:11,387
Oh, Adam.

885
00:57:13,139 --> 00:57:15,307
Well, honey, he looks okay.

886
00:57:16,016 --> 00:57:17,143
Let me see.

887
00:57:17,518 --> 00:57:19,603
Do you think this
is gonna affect him for life?

888
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:22,314
I mean, something like this
could ruin a kid.

889
00:57:22,481 --> 00:57:24,775
Honey, it might give him
a different perspective,

890
00:57:25,276 --> 00:57:26,777
help him see the big picture.

891
00:57:27,194 --> 00:57:29,822
Baby.
There they are!

892
00:57:30,865 --> 00:57:33,367
- Let's move into position!
- I'm with you, pal!

893
00:57:53,971 --> 00:57:55,931
- Help!
- Help us down from here!

894
00:57:56,015 --> 00:57:57,224
- Get us down!
- We're up here!

895
00:57:57,308 --> 00:57:58,434
We're up in the pocket!

896
00:57:59,768 --> 00:58:01,937
...Reporting live on the
progress of the giant baby

897
00:58:02,104 --> 00:58:05,566
who has just been identified as
Adam Szalinski from Vista del Mar.

898
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:13,532
The Governor's
on the phone for you, sir.

899
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:15,701
Yes, Governor.

900
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:17,536
He's a pretty big baby.

901
00:58:20,581 --> 00:58:22,958
I can get rope guns.
We can shoot ropes over him.

902
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:25,878
Absolutely not. You are not
shooting anything at my baby.

903
00:58:26,003 --> 00:58:27,254
Baby? Look at him.

904
00:58:27,421 --> 00:58:29,924
Hey, we're his parents OK?
We'll handle this.

905
00:58:30,216 --> 00:58:31,592
- Diane?
- Yeah, Wayne?

906
00:58:31,759 --> 00:58:33,260
How do we handle this?

907
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:39,141
Ready!

908
00:58:40,059 --> 00:58:41,393
Watch out! Look out!

909
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:42,853
Mommy...

910
00:58:44,188 --> 00:58:45,231
Mom!

911
00:58:45,397 --> 00:58:48,275
- Nicky, are you okay?
- Adam, put your brother down.

912
00:58:48,734 --> 00:58:50,444
Adam baby, mommy's here.

913
00:58:50,569 --> 00:58:51,946
Nicky, I'm gonna get ya
outta here right away!

914
00:58:52,112 --> 00:58:53,739
Okay, Dad, but hurry!

915
00:58:53,906 --> 00:58:56,825
We can get a fire truck in here
and run a ladder up to 'em.

916
00:58:57,826 --> 00:59:00,287
That ladder wouldn't even
reach beyond his knees.

917
00:59:07,545 --> 00:59:10,130
Adam, now, sit down
really slowly.

918
00:59:10,297 --> 00:59:11,840
I got it! Big Bunny.

919
00:59:12,007 --> 00:59:13,384
I need Big Bunny.

920
00:59:13,759 --> 00:59:15,678
- I need something called big dummy?
- No, Bunny!

921
00:59:15,844 --> 00:59:18,264
- Bunny?
- It's his favorite toy!

922
00:59:18,639 --> 00:59:20,015
It's the kid's favorite toy.

923
00:59:31,944 --> 00:59:34,738
A helicopter
is approaching with what looks like

924
00:59:34,822 --> 00:59:37,908
a giant stuffed animal
of some sort hanging from it.

925
00:59:40,703 --> 00:59:42,871
- Thanks.
- Honey, this is dangerous!

926
00:59:43,038 --> 00:59:45,332
- Don't worry.
- Pilot's ready for you, Wayne.

927
00:59:45,833 --> 00:59:47,001
It's all primed.

928
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:49,003
Be ready to activate
as soon as he's down.

929
00:59:49,128 --> 00:59:50,254
I'll be fine.

930
00:59:55,801 --> 00:59:57,970
I'm positive my dad will
have a plan to get us...

931
00:59:59,763 --> 01:00:01,682
Tell me I'm not seeing this.

932
01:00:01,849 --> 01:00:05,519
<i>Twinkle, twinkle little star</i>

933
01:00:05,686 --> 01:00:09,732
<i>How I wonder what you are</i>

934
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:13,611
- I told you my dad would have a plan.
<i>- Up above the world so high</i>

935
01:00:13,777 --> 01:00:17,906
<i>- Like a diamond in the sky</i>
- Bunny.

936
01:00:18,449 --> 01:00:21,827
<i>Twinkle, twinkle little star</i>

937
01:00:24,913 --> 01:00:28,459
<i>How I wonder what you are</i>

938
01:00:28,667 --> 01:00:32,838
<i>Twinkle, twinkle, little star</i>

939
01:00:32,963 --> 01:00:35,174
<i>How I wonder</i>

940
01:00:35,341 --> 01:00:38,260
<i>What you are</i>

941
01:00:39,178 --> 01:00:41,305
Oh, I'm tired.

942
01:00:41,472 --> 01:00:43,724
Are you tired, Big Bunny?

943
01:00:43,891 --> 01:00:47,227
Oh, yeah, I'm really tired.

944
01:00:47,394 --> 01:00:50,314
I can't remember
when I was this tired.

945
01:00:50,481 --> 01:00:52,650
Get ready, Dr. Sterling.
He's getting blinky.

946
01:00:52,816 --> 01:00:54,777
Yeah, me too.

947
01:00:54,985 --> 01:00:56,695
- I don't know what to do.
- He's getting sleepy!

948
01:00:56,862 --> 01:00:58,989
It's working.
Your husband's a genius.

949
01:00:59,156 --> 01:01:00,574
I got an idea.

950
01:01:00,908 --> 01:01:03,535
Why don't we all have a nice...

951
01:01:03,702 --> 01:01:05,120
- No!
- ...long...

952
01:01:05,287 --> 01:01:07,247
- Don't say it!
- ...nap?

953
01:01:07,998 --> 01:01:10,542
- Brace yourself!
- No nap!

954
01:01:10,709 --> 01:01:13,128
Whoa! Help! Help! I'll hang on!

955
01:01:13,253 --> 01:01:15,589
Get me away from him!
Move me away!

956
01:01:15,673 --> 01:01:17,883
No nap!

957
01:01:18,050 --> 01:01:20,386
- I get it! No nap!
- Hold on, Dad!

958
01:01:20,552 --> 01:01:22,096
Take me up or put me down!

959
01:01:22,262 --> 01:01:23,639
Roy, let's move in closer!

960
01:01:23,806 --> 01:01:25,557
I'm gonna jump!
I'm gonna jump!

961
01:01:25,724 --> 01:01:27,101
Release the bunny!

962
01:01:28,769 --> 01:01:30,854
- Whoa!
- Dad!

963
01:01:31,563 --> 01:01:32,815
Release it now!

964
01:01:36,151 --> 01:01:37,778
Run!

965
01:01:40,989 --> 01:01:43,033
- Dad, this is Mandy.
- Hi... oh!

966
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,702
Stay right there, kids.

967
01:01:44,785 --> 01:01:46,578
There's absolutely nothing
to worry about.

968
01:01:46,745 --> 01:01:49,164
I feel a whole lot better.

969
01:01:52,668 --> 01:01:56,547
Oh! Oh!

970
01:01:56,714 --> 01:01:59,133
- That's my dad.
- He seems really nice.

971
01:02:04,096 --> 01:02:06,181
Run, Dad!
Watch out for his foot!

972
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,058
Whoa!

973
01:02:10,227 --> 01:02:11,979
Are you all right?
Nice try, buddy.

974
01:02:12,771 --> 01:02:14,106
He's headed for the Strip.

975
01:02:16,734 --> 01:02:17,985
You little devil.

976
01:02:26,493 --> 01:02:27,703
He's heading toward the city.

977
01:02:27,828 --> 01:02:29,580
We'll follow and bring you
a live update.

978
01:02:29,747 --> 01:02:31,665
Adam Szalinski,
this is your mommy talking.

979
01:02:31,832 --> 01:02:33,500
You stop right now!

980
01:02:33,876 --> 01:02:35,878
Afraid that won't do any good,
Mrs. Szalinski.

981
01:02:36,378 --> 01:02:38,255
I'm sure he expects his mommy
to be bigger than he is.

982
01:02:38,422 --> 01:02:39,631
To him you're just...

983
01:02:39,798 --> 01:02:41,925
well, you're nothing more
than a talking doll.

984
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:46,889
Nothing can stop him now.

985
01:02:49,057 --> 01:02:50,809
I don't know what
these guys are gonna want.

986
01:02:50,976 --> 01:02:52,561
But we'll have to cooperate with 'em.

987
01:02:52,811 --> 01:02:54,855
- All right, go brief the men.
- Yes, sir.

988
01:02:55,481 --> 01:02:58,942
Dr. Hendrickson. Captain Ed Myerson,
Nevada State Militia.

989
01:02:59,109 --> 01:03:00,611
Captain, let's hope
we can wrap this up quickly.

990
01:03:00,778 --> 01:03:02,154
Just so you're aware, sir.

991
01:03:02,321 --> 01:03:04,990
My orders state we do nothing
without final authorization.

992
01:03:05,407 --> 01:03:06,408
Frankly Captain,

993
01:03:06,533 --> 01:03:08,035
I'm not under the jurisdiction
of the state militia.

994
01:03:08,452 --> 01:03:09,495
Your orders mean nothing to me.

995
01:03:09,578 --> 01:03:11,371
<i>A giant infant
is heading toward the city.</i>

996
01:03:11,497 --> 01:03:12,873
<i>The baby is over 50 feet tall</i>

997
01:03:13,081 --> 01:03:15,250
<i>and appears to be growing even bigger
at an alarming rate.</i>

998
01:03:15,417 --> 01:03:16,752
All right,
let's move it, Captain, now.

999
01:03:16,919 --> 01:03:19,379
If it's okay with you,
I'll just sit tight.

1000
01:03:19,546 --> 01:03:21,757
<i>..more on this story as it develops.</i>

1001
01:03:25,677 --> 01:03:27,554
There's something down
by my foot.

1002
01:03:28,096 --> 01:03:29,223
Look at this.

1003
01:03:29,473 --> 01:03:31,725
Wow, let's see what else
is down here.

1004
01:03:34,186 --> 01:03:35,229
Cereal.

1005
01:03:35,562 --> 01:03:37,564
Hey cool, want some?

1006
01:03:37,773 --> 01:03:39,399
No, thanks, I'm on a diet.

1007
01:03:40,025 --> 01:03:41,193
Have a raisin.

1008
01:03:42,277 --> 01:03:46,031
<i>Please clear the streets
for your own safety.</i>

1009
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:49,618
<i>Please stay indoors.
This is an emergency.</i>

1010
01:03:49,785 --> 01:03:52,496
<i>All pedestrians are in grave danger.</i>

1011
01:03:52,663 --> 01:03:54,623
<i>Please clear the streets!</i>

1012
01:03:59,086 --> 01:04:02,381
<i>This is the Emergency
Broadcast System. This is not a test.</i>

1013
01:04:02,548 --> 01:04:05,300
<i>A human baby of abnormal proportions
is approaching the city.</i>

1014
01:04:05,634 --> 01:04:07,678
<i>The giant appears to be
growing at a tremendous rate</i>

1015
01:04:07,845 --> 01:04:10,055
<i>and has now reached 100 feet.</i>

1016
01:04:10,222 --> 01:04:12,474
What's happening here?
Is Wayne Newton in town?

1017
01:04:12,641 --> 01:04:14,476
No, they don't do this
for Wayne Newton.

1018
01:04:14,643 --> 01:04:17,229
- It must be somebody bigger.
- Listen, babe,

1019
01:04:17,396 --> 01:04:19,982
there's nobody bigger
than Wayne Newton in this town.

1020
01:04:22,234 --> 01:04:23,777
Of course, I could be wrong.

1021
01:04:23,944 --> 01:04:25,696
Peekaboo!

1022
01:04:52,306 --> 01:04:55,183
- Is he growing or are we shrinking?
- It's amazing!

1023
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:57,686
He's doubled in size
in just a few minutes.

1024
01:05:05,986 --> 01:05:08,488
Adam! Put us down!

1025
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:10,657
You put us down now!

1026
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:13,535
<i>Howdy, partner.</i>

1027
01:05:14,786 --> 01:05:17,039
<i>Welcome to downtown Las Vegas.</i>

1028
01:05:17,581 --> 01:05:19,791
Hi-dy, partner.

1029
01:05:31,136 --> 01:05:33,388
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I think so.

1030
01:05:37,142 --> 01:05:39,603
He's toddling down the center
of Fremont Street.

1031
01:05:39,937 --> 01:05:41,939
He knows not to go
in the street by himself.

1032
01:05:42,105 --> 01:05:43,982
There's no telling
how huge he might get.

1033
01:05:44,149 --> 01:05:45,817
Especially if he touches
any of those lights.

1034
01:05:46,443 --> 01:05:47,736
We've got to get him away from them.

1035
01:05:47,903 --> 01:05:50,280
But how? There's nothing
that's gonna make him leave.

1036
01:05:50,447 --> 01:05:52,950
Unless he sees something
that he wants more.

1037
01:05:53,116 --> 01:05:55,285
Tell your men to pull over.
I think Wayne's got an idea.

1038
01:05:55,452 --> 01:05:57,079
Follow that ice-cream truck.

1039
01:06:07,255 --> 01:06:08,840
We'll need a
really big loudspeaker.

1040
01:06:09,091 --> 01:06:11,218
Who can drive an
ice-cream truck real fast?

1041
01:06:11,385 --> 01:06:13,220
- I can burn rubber.
- Well, start burning it.

1042
01:06:13,387 --> 01:06:15,222
We'll be with you
on the walkie-talkie.

1043
01:06:16,306 --> 01:06:18,475
Preston Brooks, U.S. Marshals.
We're commandeering this vehicle.

1044
01:06:18,642 --> 01:06:20,435
- Come on!
- Wait a minute!

1045
01:06:25,357 --> 01:06:27,567
- What's that?
- It's a tranquilizer cannon.

1046
01:06:27,776 --> 01:06:29,236
It's used on large mammals.

1047
01:06:29,403 --> 01:06:31,905
Cartridges can incapacitate
a target in seconds.

1048
01:06:32,072 --> 01:06:33,365
It's like a normal injection

1049
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:35,367
but on a slightly larger scale
of course.

1050
01:06:35,534 --> 01:06:38,120
Frankly, sir, I have kids myself

1051
01:06:38,286 --> 01:06:39,413
and that just doesn't seem
like the type...

1052
01:06:39,538 --> 01:06:40,831
Well naturally, Captain.

1053
01:06:41,456 --> 01:06:43,542
This is just a... a last resort.

1054
01:06:45,544 --> 01:06:46,712
I'm Bradley Swallow,

1055
01:06:46,878 --> 01:06:48,213
reporting live
from the famous Glitter Gulch

1056
01:06:48,380 --> 01:06:50,716
where certainly the biggest
story of the year is unfolding.

1057
01:06:50,882 --> 01:06:53,010
Casino owners
are understandably upset.

1058
01:06:53,468 --> 01:06:54,469
They've been ordered to evacuate...

1059
01:06:54,553 --> 01:06:56,388
The answers to our
questions lie with two key players

1060
01:06:56,513 --> 01:06:58,056
in this drama:
Dr. Clifford Sterling...

1061
01:06:58,140 --> 01:06:59,433
What we do know
is that a baby

1062
01:06:59,516 --> 01:07:00,767
by the name of Adam Szalinski...

1063
01:07:00,851 --> 01:07:03,228
has somehow measured
over 100 feet tall.

1064
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:06,773
Stop the clapping.

1065
01:07:10,235 --> 01:07:11,236
I've got a plan.

1066
01:07:11,403 --> 01:07:13,488
Great. 'Cause I'm starting
to get airsick.

1067
01:07:13,989 --> 01:07:15,824
We'll pull the thread out of
the bottom of the pocket

1068
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:18,243
and use it as a rope to slide down.

1069
01:07:18,410 --> 01:07:21,580
The scene here is one
of total confusion and chaos.

1070
01:07:21,747 --> 01:07:24,207
But so far, all the casinos
are still standing.

1071
01:07:36,511 --> 01:07:37,679
Watch out!

1072
01:07:50,692 --> 01:07:51,735
Hi!

1073
01:07:51,902 --> 01:07:53,945
Hey, don't! What are you doin'?

1074
01:07:54,112 --> 01:07:56,323
Stop! Stop! Stop!

1075
01:08:00,535 --> 01:08:01,745
We'll have to jump.

1076
01:08:03,622 --> 01:08:04,664
Hold on!

1077
01:08:07,125 --> 01:08:08,210
Don't look down.

1078
01:08:08,335 --> 01:08:10,962
Watch out for the gearshift. Jump!

1079
01:08:14,883 --> 01:08:16,718
- Go!
- I'm trying!

1080
01:08:16,927 --> 01:08:20,222
I'm trying, I'm trying.

1081
01:08:20,347 --> 01:08:22,599
- Hurry, do something!
- I'm used to an automatic.

1082
01:08:22,766 --> 01:08:25,268
- Ooh!
- We've gotta get outta here.

1083
01:08:28,855 --> 01:08:30,690
Toy car!

1084
01:08:30,899 --> 01:08:32,275
Buckle up!

1085
01:08:44,162 --> 01:08:47,290
Get away from me!

1086
01:08:47,457 --> 01:08:49,334
Adam! Adam! Don't eat us!

1087
01:08:50,585 --> 01:08:51,878
Whoa!

1088
01:08:57,050 --> 01:08:58,510
We're here live
in Glitter Gulch,

1089
01:08:58,635 --> 01:09:00,345
standing just below Adam Szalinski,

1090
01:09:00,554 --> 01:09:03,473
who has lifted a small, yellow
sports car into the air

1091
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:05,684
with three
unidentified persons in it.

1092
01:09:05,892 --> 01:09:07,352
From what I can make out,

1093
01:09:07,435 --> 01:09:09,396
it looks like two young teenagers,
a boy and a girl,

1094
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:11,439
and a man dressed
in an Indian costume.

1095
01:09:11,606 --> 01:09:13,024
What's he doing?

1096
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:16,528
He's taking something out
of his pocket. A peppermint!

1097
01:09:18,738 --> 01:09:19,656
Man!

1098
01:09:19,906 --> 01:09:21,741
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1099
01:09:32,377 --> 01:09:35,755
<i>Howdy, partner.</i>

1100
01:09:37,549 --> 01:09:39,676
Geez! Oh!

1101
01:09:42,345 --> 01:09:44,472
That car is like a toy to him.

1102
01:09:44,598 --> 01:09:47,142
I hope this thing has air bags!

1103
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:54,774
Do something, Nick!
Tell him to stop!

1104
01:09:54,858 --> 01:09:56,276
I can't! He's too big!

1105
01:09:57,319 --> 01:09:58,528
We gotta get him
away from those lights

1106
01:09:58,612 --> 01:09:59,738
before he touches any of them.

1107
01:09:59,863 --> 01:10:01,948
Brooks, what's happening
with that ice-cream truck?

1108
01:10:02,115 --> 01:10:04,409
- We're almost set.
<i>- Roger!</i>

1109
01:10:06,077 --> 01:10:07,412
Oh, no!

1110
01:10:07,579 --> 01:10:08,872
Watch the tree!

1111
01:10:16,296 --> 01:10:19,716
- Oh no! I'm gonna throw up!
- No! No!

1112
01:10:21,885 --> 01:10:24,095
Just a big baby with his toy.

1113
01:10:31,019 --> 01:10:33,104
Coming through!

1114
01:10:33,271 --> 01:10:34,731
Get out of the way!

1115
01:10:35,148 --> 01:10:37,901
- Come on, Adam, put it down.
- Come on sweetheart, put it down.

1116
01:10:39,611 --> 01:10:41,238
Ooh!

1117
01:10:42,864 --> 01:10:44,407
What's he doing now?

1118
01:10:45,075 --> 01:10:47,786
Put us down! Put us down!

1119
01:10:49,746 --> 01:10:51,081
He put it down.

1120
01:10:51,581 --> 01:10:53,291
Pick us up! Pick us up!

1121
01:10:58,755 --> 01:11:01,466
Oh, my God!
We're gonna die!

1122
01:11:04,302 --> 01:11:06,930
- What about that truck?
- Brooks? What's happening there?

1123
01:11:07,138 --> 01:11:08,181
Okay.

1124
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:10,225
We're set.

1125
01:11:12,602 --> 01:11:14,437
- No! Wait!
- Hold it! Hold it!

1126
01:11:14,604 --> 01:11:16,564
We need him
to get the kids down.

1127
01:11:17,649 --> 01:11:19,484
Cut it off!

1128
01:11:23,363 --> 01:11:25,365
- I can't stand it.
- Oh, my God!

1129
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:27,575
Oh!

1130
01:11:29,536 --> 01:11:31,288
Whatever you do, don't look down!

1131
01:11:31,496 --> 01:11:33,999
- Nick, don't let go! Please!
- I won't.

1132
01:11:34,833 --> 01:11:37,127
I'm gonna pull you back up, okay?

1133
01:11:37,627 --> 01:11:39,129
- Nick! Mandy!
- Hold on!

1134
01:11:39,671 --> 01:11:41,506
- But you gotta help.
- Okay!

1135
01:11:42,632 --> 01:11:45,802
Get the car, Adam!

1136
01:11:46,428 --> 01:11:49,347
Adam! Pick up the car!

1137
01:11:49,931 --> 01:11:51,850
- Pick up the car!
- Come on, Adam, come on!

1138
01:11:51,975 --> 01:11:53,101
Come on, sweetheart.

1139
01:11:53,268 --> 01:11:54,728
Come on, I got you.

1140
01:11:56,896 --> 01:11:59,524
Car fall down.

1141
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:08,491
Lock your door.

1142
01:12:31,723 --> 01:12:33,016
Thank you, Adam.

1143
01:12:38,063 --> 01:12:40,982
- He put 'em in the pocket!
- Honey, we can't wait any longer.

1144
01:12:41,149 --> 01:12:42,275
Let's do it.

1145
01:12:43,818 --> 01:12:45,111
Everyone stand by now.

1146
01:12:45,570 --> 01:12:46,863
<i>Attention, all casinos,</i>

1147
01:12:46,946 --> 01:12:48,948
<i>wait for my signal
to turn off your lights.</i>

1148
01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:50,950
<i>Marshal Brooks, bring on the truck.</i>

1149
01:13:01,252 --> 01:13:02,420
Nick, come on.

1150
01:13:09,719 --> 01:13:12,555
Ready, set, go, Union Plaza.

1151
01:13:14,724 --> 01:13:16,101
Go, Golden Gate.

1152
01:13:18,228 --> 01:13:19,479
Las Vegas Club.

1153
01:13:21,022 --> 01:13:24,109
Now, hit the searchlights.

1154
01:13:26,694 --> 01:13:27,987
<i>Go, Brooks!</i>

1155
01:13:30,365 --> 01:13:32,909
<i>Lucky Lady, Jackpot.</i>

1156
01:13:33,118 --> 01:13:35,912
- Come on, Adam. Come on, baby.
- Come on, baby. Go for it!

1157
01:13:36,079 --> 01:13:38,289
<i>Glitter Gulch.</i>

1158
01:13:38,373 --> 01:13:40,625
<i>- Golden Goose.</i>
- Ice cream.

1159
01:13:40,792 --> 01:13:41,835
<i>Coin Castle.</i>

1160
01:13:43,169 --> 01:13:44,671
<i>Binion's Horseshoe,</i>

1161
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:46,965
<i>Vegas World.</i>

1162
01:13:47,132 --> 01:13:48,967
This must be another one
of my dad's plans.

1163
01:13:49,134 --> 01:13:50,885
<i>- Star Palace.</i>
- Great.

1164
01:13:51,428 --> 01:13:52,470
Four Queens.

1165
01:13:53,096 --> 01:13:54,180
<i>The Fremont.</i>

1166
01:13:58,143 --> 01:13:59,811
- It's working, Wayne.
- Go, Adam!

1167
01:13:59,978 --> 01:14:01,104
He really likes ice cream.

1168
01:14:01,271 --> 01:14:02,439
Mmm!

1169
01:14:10,321 --> 01:14:11,906
- Yes!
- It's working!

1170
01:14:15,743 --> 01:14:17,704
- Ice cream!
- Where are you guys?

1171
01:14:17,912 --> 01:14:19,747
<i>This kid's gaining on me.</i>

1172
01:14:30,925 --> 01:14:33,261
We have clearance, Captain.
Move it.

1173
01:14:50,737 --> 01:14:53,031
Brooks said he caught the ice-cream
truck just outside of town.

1174
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:56,409
Next thing I know,
he grabbed it, right off the truck.

1175
01:14:56,576 --> 01:14:58,745
<i>- What'd he do with it?</i>
- What do you think he did with it?

1176
01:15:00,663 --> 01:15:02,999
- You got another idea?
- I will. Come on, let's go.

1177
01:15:03,124 --> 01:15:04,709
- Dr. Sterling?
- Wayne!

1178
01:15:06,461 --> 01:15:07,879
Do you remember
how we got Adam to hold still

1179
01:15:08,046 --> 01:15:09,255
to have his picture taken?

1180
01:15:09,422 --> 01:15:11,966
- I put him in my lap and I held him.
- Yeah?

1181
01:15:12,425 --> 01:15:14,302
Honey, he needs me.

1182
01:15:14,636 --> 01:15:19,140
The problem is, to Adam, his mommy
is somebody much bigger than he is.

1183
01:15:21,643 --> 01:15:22,894
No, Diane. It's a crazy...

1184
01:15:23,061 --> 01:15:25,063
Wayne. For almost 20 years

1185
01:15:25,230 --> 01:15:27,899
I have watched you have one
crazy idea after another.

1186
01:15:28,066 --> 01:15:30,026
It's my turn to have just one.

1187
01:15:39,077 --> 01:15:40,537
Ooh!

1188
01:15:43,164 --> 01:15:44,874
Fire!

1189
01:15:50,797 --> 01:15:53,299
- My guitar.
- Uh-oh!

1190
01:15:53,466 --> 01:15:56,261
- What now?
- Adam, don't touch that guitar!

1191
01:16:00,807 --> 01:16:03,935
I am pre-heating the lasers now,
600 volts.

1192
01:16:07,105 --> 01:16:09,148
Diane, I should be doing this,
not you.

1193
01:16:09,315 --> 01:16:11,442
There's one thing
every little kid knows.

1194
01:16:11,609 --> 01:16:12,819
Daddies mean fun.

1195
01:16:12,986 --> 01:16:14,404
Mommies mean business.

1196
01:16:14,571 --> 01:16:16,948
But this was never meant
to do anything like this.

1197
01:16:17,115 --> 01:16:19,409
Too little power
and you'll grow too slowly like Adam.

1198
01:16:19,492 --> 01:16:22,078
- Too much power...
- I trust you, Wayne Szalinski.

1199
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:29,627
Wayne, time to get large.

1200
01:16:32,505 --> 01:16:34,507
Here's your soda, sir.

1201
01:16:34,674 --> 01:16:36,259
What do you need a coke bottle for?

1202
01:16:36,384 --> 01:16:38,219
I don't. Just the bottom.

1203
01:16:39,137 --> 01:16:40,138
Oh.

1204
01:16:48,605 --> 01:16:51,232
Tom, I'm here just outside
the Hard Rock Cafe.

1205
01:16:51,399 --> 01:16:53,026
The giant baby is approaching.

1206
01:16:53,192 --> 01:16:55,236
Hello? I can't hear you.

1207
01:16:55,403 --> 01:16:59,574
Turn off the lights?
A giant what? Baby?

1208
01:17:06,247 --> 01:17:07,540
Guitar!

1209
01:17:27,268 --> 01:17:30,104
For your own safety,
please stay indoors.

1210
01:17:30,229 --> 01:17:31,397
Get off the street!

1211
01:17:31,814 --> 01:17:34,067
Adam! Don't touch the guitar!

1212
01:17:38,738 --> 01:17:41,491
No, Adam!
Adam, put down the guitar!

1213
01:17:48,873 --> 01:17:52,126
Can't this thing go any faster?
The kid might be growing again!

1214
01:17:52,377 --> 01:17:55,380
This is as fast
as we can go safely, Doctor!

1215
01:17:59,967 --> 01:18:01,511
Constance Winters live
across the street

1216
01:18:01,678 --> 01:18:03,429
from the Hard Rock Cafe.

1217
01:18:04,305 --> 01:18:07,183
He thinks the guitar
is a real musical instrument.

1218
01:18:07,725 --> 01:18:09,602
He's trying to play a tune!

1219
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:24,742
Bring me into range
and hold it steady.

1220
01:18:24,909 --> 01:18:26,202
Doctor, wait a minute,

1221
01:18:26,452 --> 01:18:29,372
if we hit him and he stumbles,
he could fall into the crowd.

1222
01:18:29,706 --> 01:18:31,374
We'll just have to hope
that doesn't happen.

1223
01:18:44,679 --> 01:18:47,890
Adam, put down the guitar
and get the airplane.

1224
01:18:48,933 --> 01:18:51,394
Airplane. Hi.

1225
01:18:51,477 --> 01:18:52,645
Hold it.

1226
01:18:53,688 --> 01:18:54,772
Steady.

1227
01:18:57,942 --> 01:18:59,235
They're shooting at Adam!

1228
01:18:59,318 --> 01:19:01,404
I assume that little maneuver
was an error, Captain.

1229
01:19:01,612 --> 01:19:04,949
Now steady or I'll make sure this
is the last mission you ever fly.

1230
01:19:05,116 --> 01:19:08,035
Hey! Pick on somebody
your own size.

1231
01:19:14,667 --> 01:19:16,335
Ow!

1232
01:19:47,617 --> 01:19:49,327
All right, let's go again.

1233
01:19:52,038 --> 01:19:54,040
Dan...

1234
01:19:54,707 --> 01:19:56,459
Hold it stead...

1235
01:19:58,711 --> 01:20:01,047
Back off!

1236
01:20:01,672 --> 01:20:02,757
Yes, ma'am.

1237
01:20:08,012 --> 01:20:10,306
You tell 'em! That's my mom!

1238
01:20:10,723 --> 01:20:12,141
I need a vacation.

1239
01:20:12,350 --> 01:20:14,977
Whoa. Look at that mother.

1240
01:20:33,412 --> 01:20:35,164
Come here, baby.

1241
01:20:35,289 --> 01:20:36,582
Mama!

1242
01:20:38,459 --> 01:20:39,877
Come to Mommy.

1243
01:20:46,926 --> 01:20:49,011
Come here, baby.
Come to mommy!

1244
01:20:49,220 --> 01:20:50,930
Mom!

1245
01:20:52,306 --> 01:20:53,558
Easy, Mom!

1246
01:20:53,724 --> 01:20:56,227
Everything's gonna be okay,
sweetie.

1247
01:20:58,312 --> 01:20:59,814
Mommy's here.

1248
01:20:59,981 --> 01:21:02,400
- Everything it's got, doctor!
- Roger!

1249
01:21:07,029 --> 01:21:08,322
You crying?

1250
01:21:08,447 --> 01:21:12,326
Yeah. It's okay to cry
when you're so happy.

1251
01:21:14,871 --> 01:21:16,664
The bearings in the generator
are about to burn out.

1252
01:21:16,831 --> 01:21:17,874
We better do it.

1253
01:21:23,421 --> 01:21:25,339
Okay, now, look at daddy.

1254
01:21:26,215 --> 01:21:27,967
Smile for daddy.

1255
01:21:29,051 --> 01:21:31,554
- There he is.
- Daddy.

1256
01:21:32,471 --> 01:21:34,473
Wayne, 1450!
It's all she can take!

1257
01:21:38,644 --> 01:21:41,647
- Say cheese, Adam.
- Cheese, Adam.

1258
01:21:45,318 --> 01:21:47,528
Come on, Wayne.

1259
01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:02,668
- Look, Adam, there's daddy.
- Daddy!

1260
01:22:03,502 --> 01:22:04,837
Honey, you did it.

1261
01:22:05,296 --> 01:22:07,256
Adam!

1262
01:22:08,174 --> 01:22:09,550
Adam, oh!

1263
01:22:10,509 --> 01:22:11,969
You gave us quite a scare,
little man.

1264
01:22:12,136 --> 01:22:13,471
I knew you could do it, honey.

1265
01:22:13,638 --> 01:22:15,640
There he is!
Let me through!

1266
01:22:17,642 --> 01:22:20,561
Well, Szalinski, you pulled it off.
Who would have thought?

1267
01:22:20,811 --> 01:22:21,979
Dr. Hendrickson...

1268
01:22:22,688 --> 01:22:26,484
that looked like some sort of rifle
that you were shooting at my baby.

1269
01:22:26,817 --> 01:22:28,194
They were tranquilizer cartridges.

1270
01:22:28,444 --> 01:22:30,363
They wouldn't have hurt him,
I assure you.

1271
01:22:30,529 --> 01:22:31,697
Oh.

1272
01:22:32,573 --> 01:22:34,200
Tranquilizer cartridges.

1273
01:22:39,747 --> 01:22:41,040
Never cross mommy.

1274
01:22:41,207 --> 01:22:43,709
We got an emergency here.
Dr. Hendrickson needs help.

1275
01:22:44,669 --> 01:22:47,296
He's overcome with the prospect
of having to find a new career.

1276
01:22:47,672 --> 01:22:50,341
Hey, big fella,
is this what you were lookin' for?

1277
01:22:50,549 --> 01:22:51,592
Oh.

1278
01:22:54,512 --> 01:22:56,263
Wayne! Nick and Mandy!

1279
01:22:57,974 --> 01:22:59,183
Weren't they...

1280
01:22:59,350 --> 01:23:00,726
In Adam's pocket!

1281
01:23:05,147 --> 01:23:06,857
- Don't tell me...
- Oh, my God.

1282
01:23:07,024 --> 01:23:08,442
Honey, I shrunk the kids.

1283
01:23:09,026 --> 01:23:10,194
Nobody move!

1284
01:23:10,736 --> 01:23:11,862
Now, don't worry.

1285
01:23:11,988 --> 01:23:14,240
I have highly specialized equipment
to deal with this.

1286
01:23:15,533 --> 01:23:17,410
I'll need the helmet
and I'll need the dog.

1287
01:23:19,328 --> 01:23:21,372
<i>Good morning, Las Vegas.
All vehicles are asked</i>

1288
01:23:21,497 --> 01:23:24,542
<i>to stay clear of the Hard Rock Cafe
where inventor Wayne Szalinski</i>

1289
01:23:24,709 --> 01:23:27,545
<i>is conducting a one-man search
to find some missing children.</i>

1290
01:23:27,753 --> 01:23:30,297
<i>It was Szalinski's matter-expanding
machine that was responsible</i>

1291
01:23:30,464 --> 01:23:32,049
<i>for last night's amazing events.</i>

1292
01:23:32,258 --> 01:23:34,176
<i>Dr. Clifford Sterling
has just announced...</i>

1293
01:23:36,345 --> 01:23:39,098
I guess your father's about the most
famous guy in the world today.

1294
01:23:41,517 --> 01:23:43,269
And I guess you're about the bravest.

1295
01:23:46,772 --> 01:23:48,399
That's for saving my life.

1296
01:23:49,108 --> 01:23:50,317
It wasn't much.

1297
01:23:51,944 --> 01:23:54,447
I don't mean your life wasn't much.

1298
01:23:55,698 --> 01:23:58,534
What I did wasn't so much.

1299
01:24:06,751 --> 01:24:09,128
How long do you think
it'll take before they find us?

1300
01:24:09,295 --> 01:24:12,423
I think it may be a while
before they find us.

1301
01:24:17,470 --> 01:24:19,388
You're kind of different, Nick.

1302
01:24:19,889 --> 01:24:21,307
Like your dad.

1303
01:24:22,725 --> 01:24:24,769
We're not all that different.

1304
01:24:25,144 --> 01:24:26,395
Yeah, you are.

1305
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:28,814
But when you think about it...

1306
01:24:29,273 --> 01:24:31,901
I guess the world needs
people who are different.

1307
01:24:32,443 --> 01:24:35,988
People who see things a little
differently, I guess you could say.

1308
01:24:47,750 --> 01:24:49,794
Are they okay?

1309
01:24:49,919 --> 01:24:52,421
Yep. I think we better give them
a couple of minutes though.

1310
01:24:52,588 --> 01:24:54,340
What are we gonna do about that?

1311
01:24:54,507 --> 01:24:56,092
Adam, look!

1312
01:25:01,889 --> 01:25:03,682
Big, Big Bunny.

1313
01:25:07,186 --> 01:25:08,979
What are we gonna do
with this?

1314
01:25:09,146 --> 01:25:11,732
Don't worry. I'll think
of something. Don't I always?

1315
01:25:13,818 --> 01:25:16,570
- Don't you trust me?
- I don't know. I don't know.

1316
01:25:16,737 --> 01:25:18,405
Oh, come on,
when have I ever...
