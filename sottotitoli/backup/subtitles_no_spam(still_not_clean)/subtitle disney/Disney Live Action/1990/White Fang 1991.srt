1
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,625
Gimme some slack.

2
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:25,333
Careful, boy. You could be his breakfast.

3
00:04:29,667 --> 00:04:31,208
Hey, don't do that. Why not?

4
00:04:31,667 --> 00:04:32,917
He's mine.

5
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:39,000
I shipped him all the way from San Francisco.
He's a family dog.

6
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:40,333
I'm going to teach him to fight.

7
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:42,625
Good fighting dog can make
a lot of money up here.

8
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,333
Hey, are you up here for the gold?

9
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:46,417
You got that right.

10
00:04:46,417 --> 00:04:48,166
Well, It's out there just waiting
for somebody to pick it up.

11
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,000
These are friends of mine.
This here's Luke, Tinker.

12
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:52,708
Didn't get your name.

13
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:55,250
Jack. Jack.

14
00:04:58,083 --> 00:04:59,166
What's your hurry?

15
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:03,208
You guys ever heard of a
man named Alex Larson?

16
00:05:03,542 --> 00:05:06,083
Alex Larson? He's my old pal!

17
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:07,500
Practically brothers.

18
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,375
Why Beauty here saved Alex's life

19
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,417
more than once. Ain't ya, Beauty?

20
00:05:10,417 --> 00:05:12,375
He'd do the same for me. Back off, buddy.

21
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:17,375
You fellas don't really
know Alex Larson, do you?

22
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:18,500
What did I tell you?

23
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:20,333
You can't fool these city boys.

24
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,250
Ah, we don't know him,

25
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,542
but we can find him.

26
00:05:23,542 --> 00:05:24,667
If he's a gold man,

27
00:05:24,667 --> 00:05:26,000
and who ain't up here,

28
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:28,542
he'll be on his way up
the golden staircase.

29
00:05:29,417 --> 00:05:30,542
Golden staircase?

30
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,542
Chilkoot Pass.

31
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,750
About two or three miles outside of town.

32
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:37,250
You'll need some help hauling
your gear to the top though.

33
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,083
I said, "Back off." Hey, easy.

34
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,583
Sorry. We don't mean to crowd you, boy.

35
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:45,208
Good luck to you, Jack.

36
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,291
See you later.

37
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,583
Yaah! Go on now! Yaah!

38
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:58,583
Hey! Hey!

39
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:00,250
Watch where you're going.

40
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:07,083
Hey!

41
00:06:08,417 --> 00:06:09,583
I've been robbed.

42
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:11,417
Welcome to the Yukon.

43
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,333
How high is that golden staircase?

44
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:19,458
About a mile, but it'll seem like more.

45
00:06:19,667 --> 00:06:21,417
Yeah, well, I can make it up that far.

46
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:43,291
Hey, I'll sell you a map of a place
where there's plenty of gold.

47
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:28,792
Come on, kid! Move it!

48
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:28,708
Hey, do you know where I
can find Alex Larson?

49
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,125
Yeah. Yeah.

50
00:08:31,917 --> 00:08:33,208
Over there.

51
00:08:42,417 --> 00:08:43,583
Are you Alex Larson?

52
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,250
It depends who's asking.

53
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,750
I sent you a letter.

54
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:52,917
Anybody who knows me knows I can't read,

55
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:54,750
so they don't write.

56
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,208
Anybody who writes me,

57
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,417
I figure I don't know them.

58
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:01,917
Well, I'm Jack, Scott Conroy's son.

59
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,959
I'm looking for somebody to
take me to my father's claim.

60
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,625
Who's in there? Name's Dutch.

61
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,750
My father sent me his
maps before he died,

62
00:09:20,792 --> 00:09:21,959
and he sent something else.

63
00:09:24,667 --> 00:09:25,750
He sent me gold.

64
00:09:26,417 --> 00:09:27,834
There was gold dust in the envelope.

65
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:30,625
If you take me out to his
claim, I'll cut you in.

66
00:09:32,792 --> 00:09:35,875
What's so funny? Everybody finds

67
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,625
That's what keeps you digging.

68
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:39,792
But you have to strike it...

69
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:43,834
And your father didn't.

70
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:48,291
Go home and find a regular job.

71
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:51,458
You wouldn't last a day out here.

72
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:53,834
I'm a good worker.

73
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:55,458
I just want what's mine.

74
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:57,291
I'm asking you to give me a chance.
Skunker.

75
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:58,458
Yeah. What is it?

76
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:03,375
Alex, I was dreaming you, me and Dutch

77
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:04,667
was living it up in Frisco.

78
00:10:05,834 --> 00:10:07,291
Get the dogs ready.

79
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,500
I hope Dutch appreciates this ride

80
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,959
'cause you should have died at the digs

81
00:10:12,542 --> 00:10:14,333
and saved us a trip back.

82
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,500
Are you going near my father's claim?

83
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:17,959
Scott Conroy's boy.

84
00:10:18,542 --> 00:10:19,542
What?

85
00:10:20,792 --> 00:10:22,500
Let me see that face, kid.

86
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:24,458
Come here.

87
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,500
My God, Alex.

88
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,667
He's the spitting image of his old man.

89
00:10:28,667 --> 00:10:30,875
And I knew your pa well. Clarence Turson.

90
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:32,000
Jack Conroy.

91
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,875
You throwing in with us?
Yeah, I'd like to.

92
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:35,750
No. No?

93
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,375
No?

94
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:39,667
You're taking him with you and
you are not going to take me?

95
00:10:39,667 --> 00:10:40,750
He looks half-dead already.

96
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,417
Hey!

97
00:10:42,417 --> 00:10:44,417
I'm... No offense.

98
00:10:44,417 --> 00:10:46,375
Give me a stick of that
gum, and I'll forgive you.

99
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:49,708
It's hard to get it up here, and it makes

100
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:51,375
my breath smell real fresh.

101
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,500
Yeah. Hey, don't

102
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:55,375
He's just tired. That's all.

103
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:57,542
He already knows there's gold there,

104
00:10:57,542 --> 00:10:58,750
and he wants it for himself.

105
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,750
Whoa, boy. You got the
hunters on the wrong dog.

106
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:05,417
Listen, if you don't want to
take me, then I'll go by myself.

107
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,375
I'll get rich by myself, too.

108
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,917
I think he's crazy enough to do it, Alex,

109
00:11:09,917 --> 00:11:12,291
and you know he doesn't stand a chance.

110
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:14,875
Come on, Alex.

111
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:17,625
He's Scott's boy. Look at him, huh.

112
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:18,917
How much trouble could he be?

113
00:11:21,917 --> 00:11:22,917
All right.

114
00:11:23,792 --> 00:11:25,375
I'll take you as far as Klondike.

115
00:11:25,792 --> 00:11:28,542
Fall behind, and I'll
leave you where you drop.

116
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,375
Understand? Yes, sir.

117
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:32,583
You're going to regret this.

118
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:34,375
Nah, Alex.

119
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,959
Ho, Digger! Come on, boy!

120
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:14,917
That a boy, Digger, pull!

121
00:12:18,834 --> 00:12:20,959
Ho! Mush! Come on, boys!

122
00:12:21,792 --> 00:12:25,458
Come on boys! Good boys! Good!

123
00:12:51,917 --> 00:12:53,000
Whoa!

124
00:12:53,542 --> 00:12:58,166
Alex, I got a loose harness on Blue.

125
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:10,500
Okay, mush! Come on, Trix!

126
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,166
That a boy!

127
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,041
Mush!

128
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,208
Pull, Digger! Come on, boy!

129
00:14:04,917 --> 00:14:06,583
That a boy, Digger! Pull!

130
00:14:08,917 --> 00:14:10,917
Mush! Mush! Come on, boys!

131
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,750
Whoa!

132
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,875
Are you all right, kid? I saw something.

133
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:27,083
In the woods.

134
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,208
Wolves. They've been trailing
us for a couple of hours now.

135
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:35,208
Game's scarce. They must be starving.

136
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:36,834
Think they are after us?

137
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,208
The dogs.

138
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:39,834
Wolves won't jump a man,

139
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,917
unless hunger's got them totally crazed.

140
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:48,959
Let's get going.

141
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:51,250
Wolves be the devil on earth.

142
00:14:51,667 --> 00:14:53,959
Kid, give me a piece of that gum
again, will you? It calms me.

143
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:57,583
I'll carry it for you, okay?

144
00:14:59,834 --> 00:15:01,959
Come on! Mush, Digger!

145
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,792
Mush! Come on, boys! Pull!

146
00:15:05,667 --> 00:15:06,750
Mush! Let's go!

147
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:11,166
All right!

148
00:15:11,834 --> 00:15:13,083
Mush! Come on, pull, buddy!

149
00:15:13,792 --> 00:15:15,125
Quit playing around!

150
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:20,208
Mmm-hmm.

151
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:24,667
You put that top a little
close to the fire, don't you?

152
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:26,625
I don't want to freeze to death.

153
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,166
What's he doing? Cleaning his teeth.

154
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:38,125
How'd they get dirty?

155
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,041
Oh, gee!

156
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:51,792
Watch it.

157
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:55,291
Whoops!

158
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,917
Yeah, I know it's a little fishy,

159
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,208
but you can put your head the other end.

160
00:16:01,917 --> 00:16:04,834
Told you, too close

161
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:18,917
Nice weather.

162
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:33,917
What are you doing?

163
00:16:33,917 --> 00:16:36,917
The only things my dogs
drag are things we need.

164
00:16:38,834 --> 00:16:39,875
That's my property.

165
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,250
You want them?

166
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:45,959
You carry them. Hold
it, hold it, hold it!

167
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:47,417
I'm going to feed the dogs, fellows.

168
00:16:48,667 --> 00:16:50,291
You're not going to kill each
other while I'm gone, are you?

169
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,959
We'll wait till you come back.

170
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:56,792
Oh, boy, here comes the fishies.

171
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:58,750
They smell good, too.

172
00:16:59,417 --> 00:17:00,708
You guys know who loves you.

173
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,917
Here you go. Here's one for you.

174
00:17:03,417 --> 00:17:05,083
And here's some fish for you, Betty.

175
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:07,291
Ow. Don't bite the hand that feeds you.

176
00:17:12,792 --> 00:17:14,583
Seven pieces of fish for seven dogs,

177
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:15,708
and you didn't get any.

178
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:17,208
What are you mumbling about?

179
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,125
Seven fish for seven dogs.

180
00:17:19,917 --> 00:17:21,125
Digger didn't get fed.

181
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,917
I swear there was a
wolf in with the dogs,

182
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,333
and I fed the damn thing!

183
00:17:24,792 --> 00:17:26,000
Well, how would a wolf
get in with the dogs?

184
00:17:26,792 --> 00:17:27,959
He's dreaming again.

185
00:17:59,959 --> 00:18:01,000
Relax.

186
00:18:01,959 --> 00:18:03,125
Fire's going.

187
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:05,333
They will keep their distance.

188
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:10,834
Alex, did I ever tell you
my uncle was a wolfer

189
00:18:10,834 --> 00:18:11,834
down in Montana?

190
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:15,000
When I was little, he used
to lower me in the hole

191
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,208
and have me shoot the cub
puppies for the bounty.

192
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:19,333
I hated doing that.

193
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,458
Get some sleep, Skunker.

194
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:44,375
Whoa! Whoa.

195
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,375
- We gonna go around?
- Yeah, the dogs

196
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,500
Just go slowly and stay to the left.

197
00:18:51,542 --> 00:18:53,208
Help me balance this. Come here.

198
00:18:53,917 --> 00:18:56,333
Let's keep it

199
00:18:57,083 --> 00:19:00,417
Oh! Oh! Oh! Hey, easy! Oh!

200
00:19:00,417 --> 00:19:02,125
Ohh! Ah!

201
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:06,208
My books!

202
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,041
Damn it, kid. Forget the books!

203
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:09,041
Look out!

204
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,000
Aah!

205
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:14,375
Hang on, kid. I got you.

206
00:19:14,959 --> 00:19:16,375
Hold on there. Now stand up.

207
00:19:16,542 --> 00:19:17,875
Dig your feet in.

208
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:19,875
Just stand up. Get your feet up!

209
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:21,417
Come on!

210
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:25,166
Got to, uh, get the rope untangled!

211
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,250
Stay!

212
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,250
Come on, Jack! You can do it, kid!

213
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:34,208
Reach up there!

214
00:19:37,917 --> 00:19:41,083
Get clear! Get clear of the sled, Jack!

215
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:42,583
Ow!

216
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:45,417
Aah!

217
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:57,917
Whoa!

218
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,417
Jack, stay right there!

219
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,250
Don't move on that ice!

220
00:20:29,959 --> 00:20:31,000
Don't move!

221
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,083
Jack!

222
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:38,125
I'll get the ammo!

223
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,667
Come here!

224
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:22,333
- Help me!
- Help!

225
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,125
Told you not to move!

226
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,125
Help!

227
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,166
Hold on! Hold on! Help me!

228
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:36,625
All right! Here's the rope!

229
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:38,208
Come on, kid! That a boy!

230
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:55,708
Just get your clothes off.

231
00:21:57,208 --> 00:22:00,208
That's it! Keep moving! Take it easy!

232
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,250
That a boy!

233
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,875
Get this off and I'll get the blanket.

234
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:07,041
He's turning blue.

235
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:14,708
That'll get you warm! Put it on!

236
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,625
Get the fire going before
he freezes to death!

237
00:22:19,542 --> 00:22:22,208
Hurry up! Take your shirt off!

238
00:22:22,542 --> 00:22:23,583
Help me!

239
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:30,959
It's gonna be too wet.

240
00:22:31,417 --> 00:22:35,250
Come on! Keep moving! That's it!

241
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,291
Books.

242
00:22:40,417 --> 00:22:44,375
Keep moving! That's it!
That's it! Come on!

243
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:47,250
Now we're cookin'!

244
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:49,542
It's going. Come on, get
him over here, Alex!

245
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:52,750
Sit down there, boy!

246
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:54,458
Put your hands under your arms!

247
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:55,708
Keep your fingers moving!

248
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:59,333
Now, let's get the rest
of these wet clothes off!

249
00:23:00,166 --> 00:23:01,583
That's starting to feel good, huh?

250
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,625
I'm sorry, Alex. I was
trying to get the ammo,

251
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:09,458
and I... Stop talking and drink this.

252
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:13,417
Drink it. Pine needle tea.
Tastes like hell,

253
00:23:13,417 --> 00:23:15,750
but it keeps the heart pumping.

254
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:23,291
I'll get Dutch.

255
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:41,375
- What's left?
- Three cartridges.

256
00:23:42,542 --> 00:23:46,291
Damn! It's like being naked out here.

257
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:51,667
"He's Scott's boy." "How
much trouble could he be?"

258
00:24:01,667 --> 00:24:03,166
We've got company.

259
00:24:05,667 --> 00:24:08,500
Shield the firelight from your eye.
Look hard.

260
00:24:10,708 --> 00:24:11,792
Let's get the dogs safe.

261
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:14,333
George, Digger...

262
00:24:15,667 --> 00:24:18,291
- Betty...
- Settle down.

263
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:19,667
Get down in there.

264
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:20,834
Get down in there.

265
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:23,500
Look!

266
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:27,417
It's a female, Alex!

267
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,750
That bitch is part dog!

268
00:24:30,417 --> 00:24:31,875
That's why she's afraid of the fire.

269
00:24:32,417 --> 00:24:34,834
She's a decoy. She draws the dogs out

270
00:24:34,834 --> 00:24:36,208
so the pack can eat them.

271
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:38,083
Digger! Come back here!

272
00:24:39,417 --> 00:24:40,500
- Digger!
- Digger!

273
00:24:40,875 --> 00:24:42,125
Darn! Come back!

274
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:44,166
Digger, come back here or I'll whup you!

275
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:46,375
Digger! Come back here!

276
00:24:46,792 --> 00:24:48,250
Digger!

277
00:24:48,542 --> 00:24:49,583
Digger, come here!

278
00:24:50,875 --> 00:24:52,375
Damn you, don't be fooled.

279
00:24:53,208 --> 00:24:54,333
Get over here!

280
00:24:55,542 --> 00:24:57,166
Digger! Come back!

281
00:24:57,542 --> 00:24:58,667
Digger!

282
00:24:59,834 --> 00:25:02,417
Hey! Are you crazy?

283
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:05,291
Skunker! Skunker! Come back!

284
00:25:05,291 --> 00:25:06,708
Digger, get out of the way!

285
00:25:07,291 --> 00:25:08,583
Don't waste the bullets!

286
00:25:17,208 --> 00:25:18,417
My God.

287
00:25:18,417 --> 00:25:19,625
Digger!

288
00:25:23,917 --> 00:25:25,250
Digger, get back here! Skunker...

289
00:25:26,333 --> 00:25:27,750
- Skunker!
- Digger!

290
00:25:28,208 --> 00:25:29,291
They're right behind you.

291
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:32,583
Come back here. Skunker!

292
00:25:53,917 --> 00:25:55,250
He's gone.

293
00:25:56,166 --> 00:25:57,291
Nothing we can do.

294
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,583
Sorry, Skunker.

295
00:26:18,667 --> 00:26:20,417
We didn't have a chance to say goodbye.

296
00:26:27,375 --> 00:26:28,458
Go to sleep.

297
00:27:08,417 --> 00:27:10,375
Help me. Come on.

298
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:49,625
Let's pack up.

299
00:28:35,875 --> 00:28:37,583
Hey! You all right?

300
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:40,667
Yes! But how did you find us?

301
00:28:40,959 --> 00:28:42,625
Followed the smoke from your fire.

302
00:28:43,041 --> 00:28:44,333
Thank God.

303
00:28:45,333 --> 00:28:46,500
You saved our lives.

304
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:46,375
What chance would a wolf cub have

305
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:48,000
of surviving on his own out here?

306
00:34:48,375 --> 00:34:49,834
None, without the pack.

307
00:37:27,125 --> 00:37:29,417
Come on. Come on

308
00:37:38,083 --> 00:37:39,208
Whoa.

309
00:37:43,208 --> 00:37:45,667
Is there any good reason why
we can't just bury him here?

310
00:37:46,667 --> 00:37:48,500
I don't think he'll know the difference.

311
00:37:50,375 --> 00:37:51,542
I gave him my word.

312
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,875
Okay.

313
00:37:55,875 --> 00:37:57,208
Okay.

314
00:38:54,458 --> 00:38:55,625
Look, the white fang.

315
00:38:57,375 --> 00:38:58,708
This wolf is part dog.

316
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,000
You know, I'm glad Dutch is dead
because I'm ready to kill him.

317
00:39:49,458 --> 00:39:51,291
Whoa! Whoa!

318
00:40:02,208 --> 00:40:03,750
Look, you old weasel!

319
00:40:05,333 --> 00:40:06,417
Look at that!

320
00:40:06,792 --> 00:40:08,291
You're home!

321
00:40:08,291 --> 00:40:10,250
You're home now! Home!

322
00:40:13,291 --> 00:40:15,291
Okay! Okay! Come on!

323
00:40:24,375 --> 00:40:25,500
Let's move out.

324
00:40:26,625 --> 00:40:28,834
The Klondike is still
a good two days away.

325
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:35,041
You going to say anything?

326
00:40:43,083 --> 00:40:45,166
You know what? What?

327
00:40:45,708 --> 00:40:49,500
I never really liked the bastard.

328
00:40:59,667 --> 00:41:02,250
Come! Come! Come here. (GREY BEAVER

329
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:03,583
Come here. Good, good.

330
00:41:03,583 --> 00:41:05,375
Over here. Over here.

331
00:41:14,542 --> 00:41:17,333
Looks like he's going to
be a good working dog.

332
00:41:23,834 --> 00:41:26,166
Over here. Come on.

333
00:41:33,458 --> 00:41:35,166
Come on. Okay, Harry.

334
00:41:36,333 --> 00:41:37,542
Hi, Joe. Hi, Alex.

335
00:41:38,083 --> 00:41:39,333
Take good care of him.

336
00:41:39,583 --> 00:41:40,875
Sure will. Okay.

337
00:41:44,625 --> 00:41:46,250
What are you going to do for money?

338
00:41:47,166 --> 00:41:49,375
Well, I got 50 bucks in my boot.

339
00:41:51,792 --> 00:41:53,208
You'll be all right.

340
00:41:53,542 --> 00:41:55,625
You can get a dry bed and breakfast

341
00:41:55,625 --> 00:41:58,625
at the edge of town.
Tell Dave I sent you.

342
00:41:58,625 --> 00:42:00,375
He'll give you a good rate.

343
00:42:00,625 --> 00:42:03,583
Okay. Uh, where are you going?

344
00:42:04,917 --> 00:42:06,208
To see a friend.

345
00:42:07,583 --> 00:42:08,834
Okay. Listen.

346
00:42:08,834 --> 00:42:10,250
Get yourself a partner.

347
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:11,792
Yeah. You're right.

348
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:13,500
Don't go off on your own.

349
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,458
Hey, don't worry about me.

350
00:42:19,375 --> 00:42:20,458
Good luck.

351
00:42:21,208 --> 00:42:22,542
Uh, thanks.

352
00:42:48,166 --> 00:42:51,166
Keep your

353
00:42:53,959 --> 00:42:57,125
Heather, sit on my lap
here and give me a kiss.

354
00:42:57,125 --> 00:42:58,500
Shut up, Clyde. I'm working.

355
00:42:58,917 --> 00:43:01,625
In pants? Why don't you put
on a pretty dress for us?

356
00:43:02,792 --> 00:43:03,959
'Cause I couldn't do this.

357
00:43:04,375 --> 00:43:05,625
Whoa!

358
00:43:07,375 --> 00:43:09,000
Don't you love me anymore, Heather?

359
00:43:13,667 --> 00:43:15,667
I can't tell you how
beautiful you really are.

360
00:43:15,667 --> 00:43:17,250
I'll get the bags.

361
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:18,458
Oh.

362
00:43:19,667 --> 00:43:22,834
Who's that? He's Scott Conroy's son.

363
00:43:22,834 --> 00:43:24,291
I brought him up here.

364
00:43:25,291 --> 00:43:26,333
Remarkable.

365
00:43:26,917 --> 00:43:28,625
He looks like Scott. Mmm-hmm.

366
00:43:34,708 --> 00:43:36,375
Belinda Casey. Jack Conroy.

367
00:43:36,375 --> 00:43:37,542
How are you? Nice to meet you.

368
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,291
Nice to meet you.

369
00:43:40,542 --> 00:43:41,542
Do you work here?

370
00:43:42,208 --> 00:43:43,291
I own the place.

371
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:44,542
Oh. Right.

372
00:43:44,542 --> 00:43:45,667
Would you like a drink?

373
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:47,458
Yeah. I'd love one.

374
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,250
Shouldn't you be at Bradford's?

375
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:52,875
Yeah. Uh...

376
00:43:54,834 --> 00:43:56,542
Uh, pleasure meeting you.

377
00:43:56,542 --> 00:43:57,750
Uh, bye, Alex.

378
00:43:58,583 --> 00:43:59,667
Bye.

379
00:44:01,375 --> 00:44:02,542
All right.

380
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:04,708
There you go. Three more!

381
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:16,875
Comin' through!

382
00:44:27,834 --> 00:44:28,875
Miss Casey!

383
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:31,041
Oh, Jack! Hi. Hi.

384
00:44:31,792 --> 00:44:32,959
How are you? Can I carry that for you?

385
00:44:32,959 --> 00:44:34,417
Yes, you certainly can.

386
00:44:34,417 --> 00:44:35,417
Got it? Yeah.

387
00:44:36,083 --> 00:44:37,834
So how'd you make out? Did
you find someplace to stay?

388
00:44:37,834 --> 00:44:39,083
Yeah, I did. Uh, huh.

389
00:44:39,667 --> 00:44:41,041
Do you know anybody else here?

390
00:44:41,792 --> 00:44:44,000
Uh, just you and Alex. Uh-huh.

391
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,542
Well, would you like
to join us for dinner?

392
00:44:45,917 --> 00:44:47,542
Yeah. I'd love to.

393
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:50,417
Good. Come by in an hour. Okay.

394
00:44:51,625 --> 00:44:53,917
You heard they made Alcatraz
into a prison? Didn't you?

395
00:44:53,917 --> 00:44:57,583
No. When I lived there, it was
used for immigration, I think.

396
00:44:57,917 --> 00:45:00,917
Not anymore. Now they've got
federal prisoners there,

397
00:45:01,417 --> 00:45:03,583
you know, soldiers that
deserted during the war,

398
00:45:03,583 --> 00:45:05,417
and some of the Indians from Arizona.

399
00:45:05,625 --> 00:45:07,583
Indians? Oh, that's horrible.

400
00:45:08,625 --> 00:45:10,750
I'll get some dessert.

401
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:12,583
Would you like some coffee?
No, thank you.

402
00:45:15,625 --> 00:45:17,417
Get out of here. Now.

403
00:45:18,583 --> 00:45:19,625
Take me where I want to go.

404
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,083
No.

405
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,083
Then I'm staying.

406
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,834
I'll think about it,

407
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:30,792
if you get out of here in two seconds.

408
00:45:33,959 --> 00:45:36,667
You're not leaving? Yes, ma'am.

409
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:37,750
It was delicious. Um...

410
00:45:40,667 --> 00:45:41,792
Could I borrow that book?

411
00:45:42,083 --> 00:45:43,458
I promise I'll return it.

412
00:45:43,959 --> 00:45:44,959
Good night, Alex.

413
00:45:45,959 --> 00:45:47,417
Good night.

414
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,667
You know, I think he really likes you.

415
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:57,834
And how about you, my dear Belinda?

416
00:45:58,500 --> 00:45:59,792
You're crazy!

417
00:46:42,583 --> 00:46:43,750
The lines are wrong.

418
00:46:46,041 --> 00:46:47,583
What makes you the expert?

419
00:46:47,917 --> 00:46:49,000
Experience.

420
00:46:51,708 --> 00:46:53,208
It'll be hard for us to control.

421
00:46:56,041 --> 00:46:57,458
Does that mean we're partners?

422
00:46:57,458 --> 00:47:00,166
It means that I'll take you
to your father's mine.

423
00:47:01,041 --> 00:47:02,208
That's all it means.

424
00:48:05,667 --> 00:48:09,125
I'll miss you. I'll miss you, too.

425
00:48:09,667 --> 00:48:11,959
Next year, we'll have that
hotel in San Francisco.

426
00:48:11,959 --> 00:48:13,750
Come on, Alex. Kiss her. I won't look.

427
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:18,125
This time, you'll see.

428
00:48:29,959 --> 00:48:31,208
- See ya!
- Bye!

429
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:32,625
Belinda!

430
00:48:33,834 --> 00:48:34,917
Feed the ducks.

431
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:38,500
Oh, you are a romantic, aren't you?

432
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:36,166
- Who are they, Alex?
- They are Hand Indians.

433
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:38,166
I know the chief of this tribe.

434
00:49:38,166 --> 00:49:39,333
We'll stop here for the night.

435
00:49:52,208 --> 00:49:53,834
We've come to see Grey Beaver.

436
00:50:12,208 --> 00:50:13,708
Good to see you, my friend.

437
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:16,083
And you. It's been a long time.

438
00:50:17,333 --> 00:50:19,792
Jack, this is Grey Beaver.

439
00:50:26,333 --> 00:50:27,792
The boat is taking water.

440
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:29,834
We have to re-tar it.

441
00:50:29,834 --> 00:50:31,041
Fine.

442
00:50:42,083 --> 00:50:43,250
What's his name?

443
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:44,250
Mitah.

444
00:50:45,041 --> 00:50:46,083
What does that mean?

445
00:50:47,458 --> 00:50:48,750
White Fang.

446
00:50:54,708 --> 00:50:55,834
Hi, Mitah.

447
00:51:00,834 --> 00:51:01,917
Can I pet you?

448
00:51:09,375 --> 00:51:11,458
No. I just wanted to pet him.

449
00:51:12,333 --> 00:51:13,792
Dogs are for work.

450
00:51:15,166 --> 00:51:17,792
Maybe they'd work a little harder
if you were a little more friendly.

451
00:51:19,166 --> 00:51:21,792
We make fire. Kill with sticks.

452
00:51:24,291 --> 00:51:25,959
Cause soul to fly.

453
00:51:28,041 --> 00:51:29,834
We are their gods,

454
00:51:30,333 --> 00:51:32,041
that is why they obey.

455
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,291
Not because we're friends.

456
00:51:38,041 --> 00:51:39,166
Mitah.

457
00:51:57,917 --> 00:51:59,000
You boys want a stick of gum?

458
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:01,959
Well, here you go.

459
00:52:04,125 --> 00:52:05,875
Thank you very much for dinner.

460
00:52:05,875 --> 00:52:07,166
It was very good.

461
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:25,166
I can't sleep when it doesn't get dark.

462
00:52:26,041 --> 00:52:27,834
You'll get used to it.

463
00:52:35,417 --> 00:52:37,166
They'll never let you forget.

464
00:53:12,959 --> 00:53:14,583
Listen, it's not food.

465
00:53:14,583 --> 00:53:17,417
You're supposed to chew it,
not swallow it, all right?

466
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:14,500
Fetch, Mako. Fetch, Mako.

467
00:57:38,375 --> 00:57:39,500
I won't forget you.

468
00:58:02,417 --> 00:58:03,417
Thank you so much.

469
00:59:20,667 --> 00:59:22,333
You're here.

470
00:59:26,333 --> 00:59:28,500
Your father wanted to
be buried on the claim.

471
01:00:52,875 --> 01:00:55,500
When I was younger, I used
to think he was a hero.

472
01:00:56,250 --> 01:00:57,583
My mother would tell me all these stories

473
01:00:57,583 --> 01:00:59,834
about where he was and what he was doing.

474
01:01:01,542 --> 01:01:02,875
I never knew what was true.

475
01:01:06,583 --> 01:01:08,875
He said he wanted to
give us a better life.

476
01:01:12,417 --> 01:01:14,083
All we wanted was for him to stay.

477
01:01:15,083 --> 01:01:17,041
What took you so long getting up here?

478
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:18,750
It's been a year.

479
01:01:22,959 --> 01:01:24,417
My mother got sick.

480
01:01:25,083 --> 01:01:26,417
She pulled through?

481
01:01:27,625 --> 01:01:28,750
No.

482
01:01:30,291 --> 01:01:31,375
Sorry.

483
01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:39,917
I know you want to keep moving,

484
01:01:39,917 --> 01:01:41,917
but I've got to try it here,

485
01:01:41,917 --> 01:01:43,583
settle in here.

486
01:01:45,041 --> 01:01:47,291
The gold is further north.

487
01:01:49,708 --> 01:01:51,583
Why don't you try it here, Alex?

488
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:55,417
There must be gold here. I
know, I know we can find it.

489
01:01:55,792 --> 01:01:57,000
It's not a bad spot.

490
01:02:01,458 --> 01:02:02,667
I'll get you started.

491
01:02:58,625 --> 01:03:00,000
Holy biscuits!

492
01:03:00,834 --> 01:03:01,917
Look at that dog.

493
01:03:01,917 --> 01:03:04,000
That ain't no dog, you idiot.
That's a wolf.

494
01:03:06,542 --> 01:03:07,708
Come on, let's go.

495
01:03:17,417 --> 01:03:19,500
Take him down there.
Let's see what happens.

496
01:03:20,542 --> 01:03:21,917
All right. Come on!

497
01:03:21,917 --> 01:03:23,041
Oh!

498
01:03:27,583 --> 01:03:28,542
Go get him!

499
01:03:29,208 --> 01:03:30,208
Go on!

500
01:03:32,542 --> 01:03:33,542
Yeah.

501
01:03:48,583 --> 01:03:50,041
Damn, I want that animal.

502
01:03:51,917 --> 01:03:53,083
Get Buck out of there.

503
01:03:53,083 --> 01:03:54,417
Buck.

504
01:03:54,417 --> 01:03:55,750
Buck, easy, boy.

505
01:03:55,750 --> 01:03:56,917
Easy, Buck.

506
01:03:57,708 --> 01:03:59,041
Get back!

507
01:04:00,083 --> 01:04:02,625
Sorry. I'm overstocked as it is.

508
01:04:02,625 --> 01:04:07,083
Down, boy. Sit! Sit! Easy.

509
01:04:07,583 --> 01:04:08,792
Mitah. No.

510
01:04:15,041 --> 01:04:16,208
Is he yours?

511
01:04:18,083 --> 01:04:20,208
Look what your wolf done to my dog here.

512
01:04:20,208 --> 01:04:21,708
Who's gonna pay for the damages?

513
01:04:26,250 --> 01:04:28,250
You know it's illegal to bring
wolves into town, don't ya?

514
01:04:29,834 --> 01:04:32,208
Luke. Go find us a mountie.

515
01:04:33,083 --> 01:04:34,750
He'll straighten this out.

516
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:37,625
Wait.

517
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,125
Here.

518
01:04:46,166 --> 01:04:47,959
Not interested in furs, chief,

519
01:04:49,125 --> 01:04:51,125
but I'll take that wolf off your hands.

520
01:04:52,792 --> 01:04:54,291
No. It's not for sale.

521
01:04:54,792 --> 01:04:56,291
That's too damn bad.

522
01:04:56,291 --> 01:04:59,000
'Cause now you're gonna
spend some time in jail.

523
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,125
Go find him, Luke.

524
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,125
No!

525
01:05:06,583 --> 01:05:07,625
How much?

526
01:05:10,291 --> 01:05:11,959
You know something, chief?

527
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:14,500
You're shrewd.

528
01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:15,750
Come on.

529
01:05:18,166 --> 01:05:20,750
This wolf's gonna make us a lot of money.

530
01:05:21,166 --> 01:05:22,333
Get in there.

531
01:05:28,291 --> 01:05:30,000
Looks like he's taken to the place.

532
01:05:30,875 --> 01:05:32,708
Come on. I'll buy you a drink.

533
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,041
Huh?

534
01:05:39,875 --> 01:05:41,667
I don't believe it.

535
01:05:41,667 --> 01:05:42,792
Hey, wolf!

536
01:05:44,208 --> 01:05:45,208
Hey, wolf.

537
01:05:46,166 --> 01:05:47,250
Watch those teeth.

538
01:05:47,250 --> 01:05:48,333
Go!

539
01:06:13,708 --> 01:06:14,917
My hands hurt.

540
01:06:14,917 --> 01:06:17,041
My head hurts. My feet hurt.

541
01:06:18,041 --> 01:06:19,583
Let's get some dynamite

542
01:06:19,583 --> 01:06:21,375
and blow the whole damn mountain up.

543
01:06:21,375 --> 01:06:23,333
Huh? What do you say?

544
01:06:23,917 --> 01:06:25,375
That would be too easy.

545
01:06:38,083 --> 01:06:39,875
What's the story in that one?

546
01:06:40,083 --> 01:06:42,333
Well, it's about this man who...

547
01:06:42,333 --> 01:06:45,708
He builds a machine. It
takes him into the future.

548
01:06:49,041 --> 01:06:50,083
I can teach you to read.

549
01:06:52,291 --> 01:06:56,250
You teach me to read,
I'll make you a miner.

550
01:06:57,417 --> 01:06:58,625
Deal.

551
01:07:03,875 --> 01:07:06,250
All right, wolf. Let's see what you got.

552
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:10,291
Come on, wolf! Yeah! Yeah! Come on!

553
01:07:10,291 --> 01:07:11,417
Come on!

554
01:07:11,417 --> 01:07:13,792
Come on, wolf! Hold him!

555
01:07:15,750 --> 01:07:17,959
Come on, wolf. Come on. Come on!

556
01:07:18,708 --> 01:07:19,792
Let's see what you got! Come on!

557
01:07:22,834 --> 01:07:24,792
Come on! Come on! Come on!

558
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:26,291
Whoa!

559
01:07:27,125 --> 01:07:28,834
Come on, boy! There you go.

560
01:07:31,125 --> 01:07:32,291
Oh, that's it. That's it. Come on!

561
01:07:34,834 --> 01:07:36,000
Yeah! Yeah!

562
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,750
Oh.

563
01:07:40,959 --> 01:07:42,125
I think he's ready.

564
01:07:49,417 --> 01:07:52,834
Wolf, don't you let me down. Get mad.

565
01:07:52,834 --> 01:07:55,291
Come on. Get mad. Get
in there and kill him.

566
01:07:55,291 --> 01:07:56,959
You understand? Come on!

567
01:08:18,125 --> 01:08:19,458
Come on!

568
01:08:20,375 --> 01:08:21,500
Let's get him!

569
01:08:23,708 --> 01:08:24,959
I'll give you a 20.

570
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:27,041
Here's five, Frank.

571
01:08:37,041 --> 01:08:39,875
Gentlemen. On three.

572
01:08:40,834 --> 01:08:42,000
One,

573
01:08:42,166 --> 01:08:43,375
two,

574
01:08:43,375 --> 01:08:44,792
three!

575
01:08:52,333 --> 01:08:53,417
Kill him!

576
01:08:53,417 --> 01:08:55,375
Tear him up, wolf! Tear him up.

577
01:08:56,083 --> 01:08:58,375
Come on, wolf, tear him up!

578
01:08:58,375 --> 01:09:00,083
Get in there! Get in there, wolf!

579
01:09:05,458 --> 01:09:07,083
Yeah! Yeah!

580
01:09:08,375 --> 01:09:09,375
Yes!

581
01:09:17,083 --> 01:09:18,166
Come on. Come on.

582
01:09:18,166 --> 01:09:19,875
Come on, wolf. You did good.

583
01:09:20,542 --> 01:09:22,875
It's a pleasure taking your money, Sykes.

584
01:09:23,291 --> 01:09:24,417
I'll be back, Smith.

585
01:09:25,083 --> 01:09:27,041
Next time, bring a live dog.

586
01:09:30,875 --> 01:09:31,959
Okay, wolf. Come on.

587
01:09:31,959 --> 01:09:33,792
I want you to get mad and
get in there and win.

588
01:09:33,792 --> 01:09:34,917
You understand me?

589
01:09:34,917 --> 01:09:35,959
Understand? Whoa.

590
01:09:35,959 --> 01:09:37,417
All right, on three.

591
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,917
One, two, three!

592
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:43,792
Come on! Go in! Go in! Yeah!

593
01:09:46,291 --> 01:09:47,375
Yes.

594
01:09:51,917 --> 01:09:54,583
One, two, three!

595
01:09:56,125 --> 01:09:57,792
Come on. Come on!

596
01:09:57,792 --> 01:09:58,917
Get him.

597
01:10:19,834 --> 01:10:21,125
Easy, boy.

598
01:10:23,041 --> 01:10:24,291
You done good tonight.

599
01:10:26,458 --> 01:10:28,125
I brought you something extra.

600
01:10:33,166 --> 01:10:35,083
Now, take it easy. Here you go.

601
01:10:46,834 --> 01:10:48,959
All right, you just keep
on hating me, wolf.

602
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,333
"It took days for the boys

603
01:11:12,333 --> 01:11:19,291
"to reach the secluded hideaway.

604
01:11:20,291 --> 01:11:24,166
"No one had set foot into the housey..."

605
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:28,166
House. House. Not housey. House.

606
01:11:28,166 --> 01:11:29,250
House.

607
01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:30,500
House. House.

608
01:11:31,208 --> 01:11:32,458
"For years.

609
01:11:32,458 --> 01:11:37,667
"When the door was finally opened and..."

610
01:11:40,250 --> 01:11:43,041
F... F... F...

611
01:11:43,041 --> 01:11:44,708
Foul? Like the birds?

612
01:11:46,041 --> 01:11:47,083
No, no.

613
01:11:47,083 --> 01:11:49,000
Fowl like the birds is F-O-W-L.

614
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,917
This is F-O-U-L.

615
01:11:50,917 --> 01:11:53,959
Foul like a bad smell, like rotten...

616
01:11:53,959 --> 01:11:56,041
Like your socks smell foul.

617
01:11:58,542 --> 01:11:59,583
I washed them.

618
01:11:59,583 --> 01:12:01,542
Yeah, well, use some soap, would you?

619
01:12:01,542 --> 01:12:04,375
If you'd spend as much time
digging as you do washing...

620
01:12:04,375 --> 01:12:06,375
I do more than my share around here.

621
01:12:06,375 --> 01:12:07,542
That's a laugh.

622
01:12:08,708 --> 01:12:10,333
Who do you think does all the cooking?

623
01:12:10,333 --> 01:12:12,125
You do, you definitely do.

624
01:12:12,125 --> 01:12:14,375
And with the way you cook,
I'm lucky to still be alive.

625
01:12:14,375 --> 01:12:16,333
Then do your own damn cooking!

626
01:12:16,708 --> 01:12:18,291
I'm not your wife.

627
01:12:19,083 --> 01:12:21,333
Yeah, that's for sure.
You're too damn ugly.

628
01:12:21,333 --> 01:12:22,583
That's U-G-L-Y.

629
01:12:39,959 --> 01:12:42,250
Maybe we ought to head
into town tomorrow.

630
01:12:43,458 --> 01:12:45,250
We need supplies anyway.

631
01:12:45,250 --> 01:12:46,542
That's a good idea.

632
01:12:51,417 --> 01:12:52,583
Unbeatable!

633
01:12:54,708 --> 01:12:56,667
Get away from that cage!
Get him away, Tinker!

634
01:12:56,667 --> 01:12:57,750
Get back.

635
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,291
Mr. Sykes.

636
01:13:02,166 --> 01:13:03,625
Step aside, gentlemen.

637
01:13:06,041 --> 01:13:07,667
What have you brought for us today?

638
01:13:12,542 --> 01:13:14,166
Where's the rest of him?

639
01:13:14,166 --> 01:13:16,125
That's a bulldog. He's pretty.

640
01:13:16,625 --> 01:13:18,667
They're killers, you moron.
Look at them jaws.

641
01:13:18,667 --> 01:13:20,000
Shut up.

642
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,083
That's Cherokee. I've seen him fight.

643
01:13:22,083 --> 01:13:23,583
Your dog's unbeatable, right?

644
01:13:24,083 --> 01:13:27,083
I've got 5,000 that says
he won't be after today.

645
01:13:28,166 --> 01:13:29,291
What's the matter, Smith?

646
01:13:29,291 --> 01:13:30,667
Too rich for your blood?

647
01:13:33,667 --> 01:13:35,125
Let's do it.

648
01:13:45,667 --> 01:13:47,500
Gentlemen, on three.

649
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:50,166
One, two, three.

650
01:13:50,750 --> 01:13:52,083
Get him, wolf!

651
01:13:55,375 --> 01:13:56,500
Cherokee!

652
01:13:59,208 --> 01:14:00,375
Cherokee!

653
01:14:00,375 --> 01:14:01,500
Come on!

654
01:14:28,458 --> 01:14:29,708
Cherokee!

655
01:14:31,542 --> 01:14:32,708
Cherokee!

656
01:14:36,333 --> 01:14:37,375
Come on!

657
01:14:37,375 --> 01:14:38,417
Come on!

658
01:14:57,750 --> 01:14:58,792
Oh!

659
01:14:58,792 --> 01:15:00,542
Oh, damn.

660
01:15:22,166 --> 01:15:23,417
Flip him over!

661
01:15:23,750 --> 01:15:25,625
Come on, wolf. Get up! Get up!

662
01:15:25,625 --> 01:15:27,166
Come on, kill him!

663
01:15:27,166 --> 01:15:28,250
Get up!

664
01:15:28,250 --> 01:15:29,625
Hey, that's White Fang.

665
01:15:29,625 --> 01:15:31,125
Stay out of it.

666
01:15:31,125 --> 01:15:32,417
It's over.

667
01:15:32,417 --> 01:15:33,750
Not yet, it ain't.

668
01:15:35,250 --> 01:15:36,834
Come on, wolf! Get up and fight!

669
01:15:41,875 --> 01:15:43,583
Somebody give me a hand here.

670
01:15:43,583 --> 01:15:44,792
Get this dog off him!

671
01:15:46,458 --> 01:15:47,792
Let go of him.

672
01:15:47,792 --> 01:15:49,291
Don't break those teeth!

673
01:15:49,291 --> 01:15:51,417
Let go, dog.

674
01:15:52,667 --> 01:15:54,250
Mounties! Mounties!

675
01:15:54,792 --> 01:15:56,792
Hey, kid! Hey!

676
01:15:57,291 --> 01:15:58,458
Kid, that's my wolf!

677
01:15:58,458 --> 01:15:59,500
Yeah, he was.

678
01:16:00,834 --> 01:16:02,291
I paid for him when you robbed
me in Skagway. Remember me?

679
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:03,625
Oh, yeah.

680
01:16:05,458 --> 01:16:06,500
You stay.

681
01:16:11,458 --> 01:16:13,250
Hey, you two. Keep an eye out for me.

682
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:14,834
This ain't finished yet.

683
01:16:24,333 --> 01:16:25,500
He's lost a lot of blood.

684
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,291
At least he won't have to fight anymore.

685
01:16:36,625 --> 01:16:37,834
Good night, Jack.

686
01:17:18,667 --> 01:17:20,500
I remember the good old days

687
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:22,708
when dogs used to pull men.

688
01:17:23,917 --> 01:17:27,000
He needs to be in the cabin
so I can take care of him.

689
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,583
I'm not sleeping in the
same room with a wolf.

690
01:17:40,291 --> 01:17:41,667
You're wasting your time.

691
01:17:42,333 --> 01:17:43,875
He was tame once. You saw him.

692
01:17:44,250 --> 01:17:45,250
He was.

693
01:17:48,375 --> 01:17:49,875
He's not anymore.

694
01:17:59,417 --> 01:18:00,792
Don't give up on me, you hear?

695
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:19,792
Congratulations.

696
01:18:20,750 --> 01:18:22,458
You've got a healthy wolf on your hands.

697
01:18:22,959 --> 01:18:24,083
Now get him outside.

698
01:18:25,959 --> 01:18:27,583
I can't do that by myself.

699
01:18:31,083 --> 01:18:33,375
Hold out a piece of meat.

700
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:34,500
All right.

701
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:36,417
I'll unhook him.

702
01:18:47,792 --> 01:18:49,667
Look at him watching my hand.

703
01:18:49,667 --> 01:18:51,458
They beat him bad.

704
01:18:52,125 --> 01:18:53,792
There's no taming him now.

705
01:18:54,125 --> 01:18:55,792
He was taught to hate.

706
01:18:55,792 --> 01:18:59,125
All he needs is a little bit of kindness.

707
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:06,583
Try it without the wood.

708
01:19:07,458 --> 01:19:08,792
You try it without the wood.

709
01:19:09,834 --> 01:19:12,500
Easy. Easy.

710
01:19:22,917 --> 01:19:23,959
Okay.

711
01:19:34,750 --> 01:19:36,125
Okay.

712
01:19:38,792 --> 01:19:40,125
All right.

713
01:19:47,875 --> 01:19:48,875
Are you crazy?

714
01:19:49,708 --> 01:19:51,959
No. I know what I'm doing.

715
01:19:51,959 --> 01:19:53,875
I hope.

716
01:19:56,834 --> 01:19:59,708
Just gonna untangle this.

717
01:20:00,208 --> 01:20:01,750
Here we go.

718
01:20:07,458 --> 01:20:08,917
Turn him loose.

719
01:20:10,041 --> 01:20:11,708
He belongs in the woods.

720
01:20:15,917 --> 01:20:17,542
Okay, Fang.

721
01:20:20,667 --> 01:20:22,542
I know you don't want to hurt me.

722
01:20:24,417 --> 01:20:27,041
But you're right. I
shouldn't have done that.

723
01:20:27,041 --> 01:20:28,834
I shouldn't have tried to force you.

724
01:20:30,083 --> 01:20:31,542
I don't know what they did to you,

725
01:20:32,041 --> 01:20:34,708
but everybody's not like that. I'm not.

726
01:20:38,083 --> 01:20:39,750
It's gonna be all right.

727
01:20:40,125 --> 01:20:42,250
So you come on out when you're ready.

728
01:20:58,750 --> 01:21:00,208
You forgot something.

729
01:21:00,708 --> 01:21:02,083
Just wait.

730
01:21:27,834 --> 01:21:29,291
Now what?

731
01:21:48,208 --> 01:21:49,625
You hungry, boy?

732
01:21:50,291 --> 01:21:51,792
Yeah, of course you're hungry.

733
01:21:51,792 --> 01:21:53,500
You're always hungry.

734
01:21:55,917 --> 01:21:57,500
Where you going?

735
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,917
Looks pretty good, huh?

736
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,875
Hey, White Fang. Hey.

737
01:22:07,333 --> 01:22:09,208
See, that was pretty good, huh?

738
01:22:09,875 --> 01:22:11,125
Hey, hey.

739
01:22:19,708 --> 01:22:21,166
Not so bad, huh?

740
01:22:23,834 --> 01:22:25,166
Want a little more maybe?

741
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:31,166
Hey, hey. Come on, boy.

742
01:22:31,166 --> 01:22:32,333
It's okay.

743
01:22:37,083 --> 01:22:39,000
I'm a pretty nice guy.

744
01:22:41,291 --> 01:22:42,875
Maybe a little more?

745
01:22:43,875 --> 01:22:45,041
Hey.

746
01:22:50,083 --> 01:22:52,041
Come on. Hey.

747
01:22:52,041 --> 01:22:54,708
White Fang, hey, look at this.

748
01:23:02,375 --> 01:23:03,917
Want a little more maybe?

749
01:23:06,708 --> 01:23:09,375
Hey, hey. Come on, boy.

750
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:11,208
It's okay.

751
01:23:12,625 --> 01:23:15,083
Yeah, not so bad. Not so bad.

752
01:23:16,917 --> 01:23:18,583
Don't tell me you're not hungry.

753
01:23:19,875 --> 01:23:22,041
Here you go. Here you go. Here you go.

754
01:23:22,959 --> 01:23:24,708
Moving slow.

755
01:23:40,959 --> 01:23:43,417
Huh? Huh? Huh?

756
01:23:43,417 --> 01:23:44,750
I'm sorry.

757
01:23:52,208 --> 01:23:54,208
Huh? Little more?

758
01:23:55,417 --> 01:23:56,875
Here you go.

759
01:24:00,250 --> 01:24:01,917
I'm not going to hurt you.

760
01:24:02,667 --> 01:24:04,083
That's not so bad.

761
01:24:10,291 --> 01:24:12,917
That's all right. That's all right.

762
01:24:27,291 --> 01:24:28,750
You're gonna be okay.

763
01:24:32,083 --> 01:24:34,458
Hey, hey, hey. Huh?

764
01:24:42,834 --> 01:24:44,125
That fool.

765
01:24:46,333 --> 01:24:47,458
Watch out!

766
01:24:50,333 --> 01:24:51,834
Put the rifle down. Put it down.

767
01:25:00,125 --> 01:25:01,291
He won't hurt me.

768
01:25:05,291 --> 01:25:06,333
See?

769
01:25:12,875 --> 01:25:14,333
Scared the hell out of me.

770
01:25:15,500 --> 01:25:17,208
I told you he was intelligent.

771
01:25:22,333 --> 01:25:23,792
Let's go! Come on!

772
01:25:30,417 --> 01:25:32,166
Come on! Oh! Ho! Ho!

773
01:25:42,834 --> 01:25:43,875
Up!

774
01:25:45,875 --> 01:25:47,041
Come on. Get it.

775
01:25:47,041 --> 01:25:48,542
All right. Come on!

776
01:25:58,792 --> 01:26:01,000
Hey, hey. Whoa! Get back here.

777
01:26:07,959 --> 01:26:10,208
I'm gonna go back in
and get one more load.

778
01:26:10,208 --> 01:26:12,583
Don't. It's late.

779
01:26:12,917 --> 01:26:13,959
Come on, boy.

780
01:26:26,250 --> 01:26:27,291
Jack!

781
01:26:27,959 --> 01:26:28,959
Jack!

782
01:26:38,250 --> 01:26:39,834
Help.

783
01:26:39,834 --> 01:26:40,959
Jack.

784
01:26:40,959 --> 01:26:42,375
Alex, help!

785
01:26:46,125 --> 01:26:47,917
Jack! Help!

786
01:26:48,125 --> 01:26:50,041
Help! Alex!

787
01:26:55,166 --> 01:26:56,583
Hey, buddy.

788
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:07,583
Are you all right?

789
01:27:07,583 --> 01:27:09,458
The sky never looked so blue.

790
01:27:14,583 --> 01:27:16,792
No, it can't be.

791
01:27:16,792 --> 01:27:17,917
What?

792
01:27:43,291 --> 01:27:44,500
Holy mackerel!

793
01:27:45,083 --> 01:27:47,166
We're rich. Aren't we?

794
01:27:47,542 --> 01:27:49,125
It's just like we dreamed of.

795
01:27:49,333 --> 01:27:50,500
It's gold, all right.

796
01:27:52,458 --> 01:27:55,000
If the quality is bad,
it won't be worth much.

797
01:27:55,375 --> 01:27:58,333
No sense getting crazy just yet.

798
01:28:05,375 --> 01:28:08,166
You're sure you don't want
to take him with you?

799
01:28:08,542 --> 01:28:10,500
No, there'll be too many people.

800
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:15,000
Okay. Bye-bye.

801
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:21,000
Listen, don't get caught
up in anything there.

802
01:28:21,333 --> 01:28:22,917
Just get in,

803
01:28:22,917 --> 01:28:25,667
get it tested, and get back here.

804
01:28:27,083 --> 01:28:28,708
Soon as I can.

805
01:28:31,083 --> 01:28:33,291
What are you gonna do without me?

806
01:28:33,291 --> 01:28:35,083
I'll yell at the wolf.

807
01:28:48,125 --> 01:28:49,667
I guess he's coming with me.

808
01:28:52,041 --> 01:28:53,250
I'll pick up a new window.

809
01:29:04,083 --> 01:29:05,583
How you doing?

810
01:29:05,583 --> 01:29:07,208
I'd like to have this tested.

811
01:29:09,250 --> 01:29:11,250
I'm on claim number seven

812
01:29:11,250 --> 01:29:12,625
right below Discovery on New Creek.

813
01:29:13,583 --> 01:29:16,250
Now I assume you want to
deposit this with our bank?

814
01:29:17,291 --> 01:29:18,291
Yes.

815
01:29:22,291 --> 01:29:24,250
What is it, huh?

816
01:29:25,458 --> 01:29:27,083
I hope he's been fed.

817
01:29:36,375 --> 01:29:37,583
Here it is.

818
01:29:38,083 --> 01:29:41,250
Fee and deposit paid for by Scott Conroy

819
01:29:41,250 --> 01:29:42,500
in his name and his son's.

820
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:45,500
You Jack Conroy? Yeah, that's me.

821
01:29:46,083 --> 01:29:49,458
I'd also like you to add
Alexander Larson's name.

822
01:29:49,458 --> 01:29:51,083
It's your gold.

823
01:30:31,250 --> 01:30:34,208
Oh, he's completely recovered.

824
01:30:34,208 --> 01:30:36,667
All right, we got to get going.

825
01:30:36,667 --> 01:30:38,333
You just got here, Jack.

826
01:30:38,333 --> 01:30:41,208
Well, we've got some things to do.

827
01:30:41,208 --> 01:30:42,500
Don't forget what you came for.

828
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:44,542
Oh, right. Come on, White Fang.

829
01:30:45,333 --> 01:30:46,708
Take care, Jack, and be careful.

830
01:30:46,708 --> 01:30:47,792
I will. Bye-bye.

831
01:30:47,792 --> 01:30:48,792
Come on.

832
01:30:58,208 --> 01:30:59,500
What did they say?

833
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:00,750
Who?

834
01:31:00,750 --> 01:31:02,458
The assayer. Who else?

835
01:31:02,458 --> 01:31:04,375
What's wrong with you?

836
01:31:04,375 --> 01:31:06,708
Well, read for yourself.

837
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:12,708
"The

838
01:31:15,750 --> 01:31:19,458
"quality of gold

839
01:31:19,458 --> 01:31:24,875
"found at the claim of Jack
Conroy and Alexander..."

840
01:31:26,417 --> 01:31:28,375
"Larson, tested and
weighed by the assayer

841
01:31:28,375 --> 01:31:31,458
"at Klondike City on the
11th day of August 1898

842
01:31:31,458 --> 01:31:35,208
"is found to be 98% pure." We're rich.

843
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:39,542
We are rich!

844
01:31:40,583 --> 01:31:42,333
"Very rich," that's what the guy says.

845
01:31:42,333 --> 01:31:43,875
The guy says, "Very rich."

846
01:31:43,875 --> 01:31:46,458
He says we are filthy, stinking rich.

847
01:31:57,750 --> 01:31:59,375
Whoo!

848
01:32:04,625 --> 01:32:06,208
While you were gone,

849
01:32:07,625 --> 01:32:09,208
I did some thinking.

850
01:32:11,458 --> 01:32:13,708
I'd like you to come back
with us to San Francisco.

851
01:32:16,625 --> 01:32:18,458
Be part owner of our hotel.

852
01:32:23,750 --> 01:32:25,208
So what do you think?

853
01:32:27,583 --> 01:32:30,500
I think it sounds like a good idea.

854
01:32:31,291 --> 01:32:33,333
I'll name it after your father,

855
01:32:33,333 --> 01:32:34,792
Royal Scott Hotel.

856
01:32:37,625 --> 01:32:38,917
To your father.

857
01:32:41,291 --> 01:32:42,417
Good friend.

858
01:32:45,750 --> 01:32:47,583
Dream on, boys.

859
01:33:02,792 --> 01:33:04,792
There's something on the roof.

860
01:33:21,458 --> 01:33:22,792
You must have been followed.

861
01:33:26,333 --> 01:33:28,291
I was careful, Alex. I did what you...

862
01:33:30,291 --> 01:33:32,333
White Fang, get under here.

863
01:33:32,333 --> 01:33:33,458
Come on.

864
01:33:37,667 --> 01:33:38,834
They stuffed the pipe.

865
01:33:49,291 --> 01:33:50,333
Stay down!

866
01:33:55,917 --> 01:33:58,500
Put this over your head.

867
01:33:58,500 --> 01:34:00,000
It will help you breathe.

868
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:04,917
They can't stay in there much longer.

869
01:34:04,917 --> 01:34:06,542
Hold your fire until they come out.

870
01:34:06,792 --> 01:34:08,333
Maybe they're dead.

871
01:34:14,583 --> 01:34:16,834
That's Comin' 'Round the
Mountain, ain't it?

872
01:34:18,875 --> 01:34:20,333
I hate that song.

873
01:34:27,750 --> 01:34:29,417
That will keep them guessing.

874
01:34:39,750 --> 01:34:41,291
They ain't taking the hint.

875
01:35:16,834 --> 01:35:18,125
Let's move in.

876
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:23,417
Get in there, Tinker.

877
01:35:24,125 --> 01:35:25,625
Well, earn your keep.

878
01:35:59,667 --> 01:36:01,000
Aah!

879
01:36:07,041 --> 01:36:08,542
Hey, get him off me!

880
01:36:08,542 --> 01:36:09,792
Get him off of me.

881
01:36:14,959 --> 01:36:15,959
Hey!

882
01:36:17,458 --> 01:36:19,125
Easy, easy, easy.

883
01:36:21,875 --> 01:36:23,708
Easy, easy.

884
01:36:24,834 --> 01:36:26,500
Hey, look at this now.

885
01:36:26,500 --> 01:36:28,834
Hey, fellas, look at this now.

886
01:36:37,750 --> 01:36:39,208
Hey, go get us some mounties, would you?

887
01:36:39,208 --> 01:36:40,834
Yes, sir!

888
01:36:41,417 --> 01:36:43,125
Come on, everybody. Free drinks.

889
01:36:43,125 --> 01:36:44,583
Come on in.

890
01:36:44,583 --> 01:36:46,041
Free drinks?

891
01:36:46,750 --> 01:36:47,875
I'm right behind you.

892
01:36:47,875 --> 01:36:49,542
Free drinks on Alex Larson.

893
01:36:49,542 --> 01:36:51,708
Don't ask me twice!

894
01:36:54,875 --> 01:36:56,041
Come on, here we go.

895
01:36:56,041 --> 01:36:57,542
Don't shove, now!

896
01:37:04,834 --> 01:37:06,208
Get another keg of beer!

897
01:37:16,875 --> 01:37:19,708
If we are going to catch
that boat in Skagway,

898
01:37:19,708 --> 01:37:21,959
we've got to leave soon.

899
01:37:23,250 --> 01:37:24,875
You know you can't take him with you.

900
01:37:25,959 --> 01:37:27,708
He'll be miserable in the city.

901
01:37:31,500 --> 01:37:32,750
He has to run free.

902
01:37:33,792 --> 01:37:35,083
That's his magic.

903
01:37:38,625 --> 01:37:40,125
He thinks you are a wolf.

904
01:38:56,291 --> 01:38:58,667
You take care of yourself, all right?

905
01:39:07,083 --> 01:39:09,959
Go on. You're free. Go on.

906
01:39:14,625 --> 01:39:16,625
Go on. Get out of here!

907
01:39:18,959 --> 01:39:21,166
Listen to me. Go, go! Go!

908
01:39:24,041 --> 01:39:25,333
Go!

909
01:39:28,792 --> 01:39:30,041
Go on! Go!

910
01:39:31,750 --> 01:39:33,667
Listen to me. Go!

911
01:39:35,208 --> 01:39:37,667
Get out of here! Go!

912
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,208
Go on!

913
01:39:43,667 --> 01:39:44,834
Get out of here!

914
01:39:54,250 --> 01:39:55,583
Go on!

915
01:40:52,291 --> 01:40:53,834
Oh, here he is, Alex.

916
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:01,250
Where's the wolf?

917
01:41:02,250 --> 01:41:03,792
I let him go.

918
01:41:17,291 --> 01:41:18,291
Bye, Heather.

919
01:41:18,291 --> 01:41:19,834
Don't let them get away with anything.

920
01:41:19,834 --> 01:41:21,417
I won't. Bye.

921
01:41:44,834 --> 01:41:47,333
I can't believe this
is actually happening.

922
01:41:53,792 --> 01:41:55,500
Alex, I got to tell you something.

923
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:58,166
I can't leave.

924
01:42:03,792 --> 01:42:05,333
Not yet.

925
01:42:06,166 --> 01:42:07,333
I'm gonna go back to the claim.

926
01:42:12,458 --> 01:42:13,500
Miss Casey.

927
01:42:16,208 --> 01:42:17,542
So long.

928
01:42:31,959 --> 01:42:33,875
Your father would be proud of you.

929
01:42:39,375 --> 01:42:41,917
I'll keep an eye on your gold for you.

930
01:42:41,917 --> 01:42:44,333
You better. And leave a room open for me.

931
01:42:44,333 --> 01:42:45,333
I have to.

932
01:42:46,208 --> 01:42:47,250
You're part owner.

933
01:44:34,250 --> 01:44:35,291
White Fang.

934
01:44:40,166 --> 01:44:41,166
Come on.
