00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,830

00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,969

00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:37,479

172
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:59,120
Start unzipping, Parker.

over the entire vineyard and then...

249

- Who... who's that?
- Oh, that's my dad.

250

He didn't know I was taking the picture
then or else he'd have turned around.

- Oh, sure. I love Oreos.

- I know. I don't get it.
- Me either.

258
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:49,429
What's your dad like? I mean, is he
the kind of father you can talk to or

259
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:51,529
is he one of those workaholic types who says,

260
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:55,569
"I'll talk to you later, honey,"but, you
know, never really does? I hate that

261
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:57,769
I don't have a father, actually.

262
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:03,039
I mean, I had one once, I suppose,
but my parents divorced years ago.

263
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,079
My mother never even mentions him.

264
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:08,679
It's like he evaporated into
thin air or something.

265
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,479
It's scary the way nobody
stays together anymore.

266
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,649

- I'll be 12 on October 11.

- Your birthday's on October 11?

269
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:24,229
- Yeah.
- How weird is that?

270
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,899
Extremely.

271
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,369

272

273
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:44,149
- What's the matter?
- Hallie, what's your mother like?

274
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:48,989
I never met her. She and my dad split up
when I was a baby. Maybe even before.

275
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:51,759
I'm not sure. He doesn't like to talk about her.

276
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,979
But I know she was really, really beautiful.

277
00:24:55,979 --> 00:24:57,289
How do you know that?

278
00:24:57,290 --> 00:25:01,129
Well, because my dad had this old picture
of her hidden in his sock drawer.

279
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:05,459
He caught me looking at it, like, all
the time so he gave it to me to keep.

280
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,869
Look, I'm... I'm really thirsty.

281
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:09,368
Sure you don't want to go to the mess
hall and get a lemonade or something?

282
00:25:09,369 --> 00:25:13,149
Will you stop thinking about your
stomach at a time like this?

283
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:16,770
- At a time like what?
- Don't you realize what's happening?

284
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:19,719
I mean, think about it.

285
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,649
I only have a mother and you only have a father.

286
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:27,719
You've never seen your Mom
and I've never seen my dad.

287
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:32,999
You have one old picture of your Mom
and I have one old picture of my dad.

288
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,669
But at least yours is probably a whole picture,

289
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:40,969
mine's a pathetic little thing all crinkled
and ripped right down the middle and...

290

What are you rummaging in your trunk for?

291
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:50,849
This. It's the picture of my
mom. And it's ripped too.

292
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:56,070
- Right down the middle?
- Right down the middle.

324

Neither one of our parents
never got married again.

Has Dad ever been close to getting remarried?

326

Never. He always says I'm
the only girl in his life.

00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:35,749
Come on. Let's see what all the fuss is about.

483
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:39,049
- OK. I'm here.
<font color=#FF551>- MAN:</font> Ah, we're saved.

00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:40,589
- Hi, Vendela.
- Hi.

485
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:42,589
Sorry, we don't know what to do with the veil.

486
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:45,759
If she wears it it covers the back of the dress
and if she doesn't, the dress looks...

487
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:49,729
incomplete. You're right. Can you try
turning sideways with your chin up?

488
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:53,669
Yeah. I see the problem. Can I
have the veil? Annie, darling?

489
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:57,009
Pass me one of those hats
on display in the window.

490
00:42:57,010 --> 00:42:59,230

- The white one.

492
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:08,470
Me too.

493
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:14,019
Try this. Now throw the veil straight back.

494
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:16,729
That's it. Now spin around, I want
to see the back of the dress.

495
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:20,229
That's beautiful. Did you get that?
Just how it falls just down there.

496
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:23,829
Don't worry about the bouquet. You're married
now, you've got to learn to juggle.

497
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:27,299
Don't forget to look happy.
It is your wedding day.

498
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:33,639
- My mom is too cool.

ever make you think about
getting married again,

504
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:02,269
or at least make you think about the F-word?

505

- The F-word?
- My father.

506

Oh, that F-word. Well, no, actually,

507
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:12,879

Why the sudden curiosity about your dad, huh?

510
00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:22,519
Well, maybe because he's never mentioned,
and you can't blame a kid for wondering.

511
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:26,429
Mother, you can't avoid the subject for
ever. At least tell me what he was like.

512
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:33,499
OK. He was quite lovely, to tell you the truth.
When we met he was actually entirely lovely.

513
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:37,069
- All right?
- All right. So did you meet him here in London?

514
00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:39,739
- We met on the QE2.
- QE what?

515
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:43,979

We met our first night on board ship. We
were seated next to each other at dinner.

518
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:56,050
- He's an American, you know.
- No kidding? So, was it love at first sight?

519
00:44:56,360 --> 00:45:01,199
I knew you were going to ask me
all these questions one day. Taxi!

Hey, Hal!

Welcome home, kiddo.

525
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:38,869
- Get into these arms, you little punk.
- Dad.

526
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:41,290
Finally.

527
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:49,009
Oh, I hope you had a lousy
time at that camp because

528
00:45:49,010 --> 00:45:52,600
you are not going back. I missed you too much.

529
00:45:53,950 --> 00:45:55,989
What happened to you, Hal?

530
00:45:55,990 --> 00:45:58,319
Something's changed.

531
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,710
Are you getting taller?

532
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:04,789
So, what's up, Dad?

533
00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:07,029
I mean, how's Chessy and everybody?

534
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:10,499
Great. Everybody's great. Can't wait to see you.

535
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:14,399
Eight weeks really is too long, Hal.
A lot's been happening around here.

536
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,909
A lot's happened to me too, Dad.

537
00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:20,730
I mean, I feel like I'm practically a new woman.

538
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:24,279
What's the matter? I cut myself shaving?

539
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:28,519
No, it's just... just seeing
you for the first time.

540
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:32,189
I mean, you know... in so long.

541
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:34,819
You look taller to me too, Dad.

542
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:37,750
Come on, squirt. Let's get home.

543
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:54,539
<font color=#FF551>DAD:</font> Oh, by the way, thanks
for all those newsy letters.

544
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:57,049
I'm really glad I bought you all that
personalized stationery

545
00:46:57,050 --> 00:46:59,049
you just had to have.

546
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:02,089
- Well, we meant to write, Dad, but we just...
- "We?"

547
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:06,839
Oh, me and my friend. I... I met this
girl at camp and we got really close.

548
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:10,380
- Great.
- Practically like sisters.

549
00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:13,459
- She was a lovely girl.
- "Lovely girl?"

550
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:16,220
What, all of a sudden you're so proper?

551
00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:20,499
- Still biting those nails, I see.
- Dad, you noticed!

552
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:24,169
What do you mean, "noticed?" You've
been biting them since you could chew.

553
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:26,239
But I've decided to stop, Dad.

554
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:29,549
- It's a horrid habit.
- "Lovely girl," "horrid habit."

555
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:32,849
What did I do, send you to summer
camp or finishing school?

556
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:35,619
And why do you keep saying "Dad"
at the end of every sentence?

557
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:38,740
I'm sorry. I didn't realize I was doing it, Dad.

558
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:42,250
Sorry, Dad.

559
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:47,259
Do you want to know why I keep
saying "Dad?"? The truth?

560
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:50,449
'Cause you missed your old man so much, right?

561
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:54,659
Exactly. It's because in my whole life...

562
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:57,339
I mean, you know, for the past eight weeks...

563
00:47:57,340 --> 00:48:02,529
I was never able to say the
word "Dad." Never. Not once.

564
00:48:02,530 --> 00:48:07,319
And if you ask me, I mean, a dad is an
irreplaceable person in a girl's life.

565
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:11,419
Think about it. There's a whole day
devoted to celebrating fathers

566
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:14,359
Just imagine someone's life without a father.

567
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:18,689
Never buying a Father's Day card.
Never sitting on their father's lap.

568
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:23,469
Never being able to say, "Hi, Dad!" or, "What's
up, Dad?" or, "Catch you later, Dad."

569
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:26,689
I mean, a baby's first words are
always "Dada," aren't they?

570
00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:31,039
Let me see if I get this. You missed
being able to call me "Dad?"

571
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:34,930
Yeah. I really have, Dad.

572
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:44,149
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

573
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:47,180

you out of going back to camp, OK?

Hmm. I can't put my finger on it,

584

but something about you
has definitely changed.

Wow, it's even better than the pictures.

OK, kiddo. What do you want to do first, huh?

593
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:34,929
You want to eat and then unpack,
or we could unpack and then eat.

594
00:50:34,930 --> 00:50:37,699
Or we could eat while we unpack.

595
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:43,269
- You mean I can eat in my room?
- Yeah, it's a definite possibility.

596

Hey, Hal. When you're done, come on down.
There's someone I want you to meet.

- OK, Dad.
- OK, Hal.

- It will.

601

Tell me what?

602

Hal, it is none of my business how your
father makes a fool out of himself, OK?

603
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:14,460
- He's a big boy. He can do what he wants.
- OK, OK. So, who is she?

604
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:20,779
Her name's Meredith Blake. She's
a publicist from San Francisco.

605
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:24,899
Your father hired her at the beginning of the
summer to do some publicity for the vineyard.

606
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:29,119
If you ask me, she's doing a better job
of selling herself than the grapes.

610
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:42,189
So I gotta ask myself, what does
a hot young thing like that

611
00:51:42,190 --> 00:51:44,929
see in a guy who walks around
with his shirttail hanging out

612
00:51:44,930 --> 00:51:47,469
and a cereal bowl full of chili.

613
00:51:47,470 --> 00:51:52,790
Then I realized there's about a million
reasons why that girl's giggling.

614

All of them are sitting at the
Napa Valley Community Bank.

615

You mean, you don't think
she even really likes him?

616
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:01,149
Ah, what do I know?

617
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:05,049
But I tell you one thing, this one's got your
father eating out of the palm of her hand.

618
00:52:05,050 --> 00:52:08,559
They do everything together. They
ride together, they swim together.

619
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:10,489
They go out to eat dinner every night.

620
00:52:10,490 --> 00:52:15,150
Do you know what? Meet her. See for
yourself. Don't let me influence you.

621
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:20,939
There's my girl. Honey, I want
you to meet a friend of mine.

622
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:25,100
Hal, this is Meredith Blake.

623
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:30,300

Oh, Nicky, she's adorable.

628

You know, the way your
father talked about you,

629
00:52:47,390 --> 00:52:50,899
I expected to meet a little
girl, but you are so grown-up.

630
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:54,820
I'll be 12 soon. How old are you?

631
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:57,139
26.

632
00:52:57,140 --> 00:53:00,479
Only 15 years older than me.
How old are you again, Dad?

633
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:03,609
Wow, suddenly you're so interested
in math. Look, I'm gonna go inside.

634

I'm going to get some more chili, maybe
a bottle of champagne to celebrate.

- Be right back.

638
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,920
Meredith Blake.

639
00:53:18,930 --> 00:53:21,699
Hello, Reverend Mosby.

640
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:23,329
Mm-hm.

641
00:53:23,330 --> 00:53:26,869
Of course. No, I understand
it's for a local charity?

642
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:30,599
Oh, yes, I am writing it all down.

643
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:33,279
OK, it sounds very worthwhile, I agree,

644
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:37,949
but unfortunately I see that Mr. Parker
will be out of the country on those days.

645
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:41,519
Yes, absolutely. I will be
sure to mention it to him.

646
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,240
Thank you.

647
00:53:43,950 --> 00:53:44,549
So...

648
00:53:45,050 --> 00:53:47,889
How was camp, Hal? Was it fabulous?

649
00:53:47,890 --> 00:53:51,329
- My dad's going out of the country?
- Oh. No.

650
00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:55,099
I just had to tell a little white lie
to get him out of something.

651
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:58,719
You know, I have never heard
a man talk about his daughter

652
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:01,239
the way that Nicky talks about you.

653
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:03,389
You two are obviously incredibly close.

654
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:08,100
Well, you know, we're closer than
close. We're all each other has.

655
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:12,830
<font color=#ff00ff>[SHRIEKS]</font>

656
00:54:13,310 --> 00:54:18,640
- Sorry. Did I get you wet, Mer?
- Just a little, Hal.

657
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:24,189
Hey, guess what.

658
00:54:24,190 --> 00:54:28,159
Your daddy took me riding the other
day and he let me ride your horse.

659
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,929
I hope that's OK with you.

660
00:54:29,930 --> 00:54:34,799
Oh, sure. Sprout's used to
strange women riding her.

661
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,239
Not that you're strange or anything.

662
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:41,029
Actually, compared to the others
you're relatively normal.

663
00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:43,609
Others? What others?

664
00:54:43,610 --> 00:54:47,019
- You want the 411?
- What's the 411?

665
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:50,449
The information, the lowdown on other women.

666
00:54:50,450 --> 00:54:51,789
Can't say I blame you.

667
00:54:51,790 --> 00:54:55,479
I'd want to know if I was number
28... I mean, 29... in a man's life.

668
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:57,859
- I'm number 29?
- Yeah.

669
00:54:57,860 --> 00:55:02,029
It's always the same routine. Horseback
riding through the vineyards,

670
00:55:02,030 --> 00:55:06,969
romantic dinners with his special
reserve label wine. Moonlight swims.

671
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:11,339
Here we go. A bottle of my
special reserve label.

672
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:16,309
So, did you girls find something
to talk about while I was gone?

673
00:55:16,310 --> 00:55:19,979
- Does that mean yes?
- It sure does.

00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:30,459

- Yes, Martin?

677
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:32,329
Oh, dear, it sounds just like you on the phone.

678
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:36,699
I'm sorry. To whom did you
wish to speak? Annie?

679
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:39,439
Of course. One moment, please.

680
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:44,139
A Mildred Plotka for you.
Sounds just like your twin.

681
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:51,679
My twin? Very funny. Good one, Martin. Hello?
Oh, Mildred, darling. Hi, how are you?

682
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,599
Hey. How's it going over there?

683
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:57,049
<i>Oh, everything's quite lovely here.
We're expecting a bit of rain today,</i>

684
00:55:57,050 --> 00:56:00,019
but, Mildred, can you... can
you hold on for a moment?

685
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:03,580
OK, but hurry, Hal. I've got to talk to you.

686
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,999
OK. Now I can talk. Oh, my
God, Mom's incredible.

687
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,969
I cannot believe I lived my entire
life without knowing her.

688
00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:15,289
She's... she's beautiful and fun and smart

689
00:56:15,290 --> 00:56:17,329
- <i>and I love the gowns she designs.</i>
- But...

690
00:56:17,330 --> 00:56:20,109
And I got her talking about
how she and Dad first met

691
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:23,139
- and if you ask me there's a whole...
- <i>Hallie!</i>

692
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:24,779
Stop! We've got a major problem.

693
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:27,549
You're going to have to bring
Mother out here immediately.

694
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:30,619
Immediately? Are you nuts? I've
only had one day with her.

695
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:33,259
I'm just getting to know her I can't. I won't.

696
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:36,259
But this is an emergency. Dad's in love.

697
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:40,559
Get out of here. Dad doesn't fall in
love. I mean, at least not seriously

698
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:43,299
Trust me, he's serious about this one.

699
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:47,899
He's always holding her hand and kissing
her neck and waiting on her hand and foot.

700
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:50,509
- He is?
- It's disgusting.

701
00:56:50,510 --> 00:56:53,509
You'll just have to break them up. Sabotage
it. Do whatever you have to.

702
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:56,339
I'm trying, but, I mean, I'm
at a slight disadvantage.

703
00:56:56,340 --> 00:56:59,349
<i>I only met the man 12 hours ago.</i>

704
00:56:59,350 --> 00:57:01,679
<i>Hal, you've got to get back here to help me.</i>

705
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:04,589
Annie, I can't. I want more time with Mom.

706
00:57:04,590 --> 00:57:07,109
<font color=#ff00ff>- [RUSTLING]</font>
- What's going on?

707
00:57:07,110 --> 00:57:09,489
Ann, are you still there? I can barely hear you.

708
00:57:09,490 --> 00:57:11,289
- I'm here, what are you...?
- <i>Operator, operator.</i>

709
00:57:11,290 --> 00:57:14,730
- I think I lost you, Ann.
- <i>Hello?</i>

710
00:57:15,730 --> 00:57:18,620
Thanks for all the help, Hal.

711
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:21,860
Ahem.

712
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:25,669
Hi. I had a phone call from a friend at camp.

713
00:57:25,670 --> 00:57:30,209
Yeah, it's an old camp tradition, talk
to your friend from inside a closet.

714
00:57:30,210 --> 00:57:33,070
Kind of stupid, I know, but...

715
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:37,850
So, breakfast, anyone?

716
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,159
OK. Here we go. Most important meal of the day.

717
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:45,189
Eggs, sunnyside up. Bacon, side of toast.

718
00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:48,989
And in case you're really hungry, a stack
of humongous chocolate chip pancakes,

719
00:57:48,990 --> 00:57:51,569
which smell incredible, if I do say so myself.

720
00:57:51,570 --> 00:57:53,230
Thanks, Chessy.

721
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:56,429
You're not hungry again?

722
00:57:56,430 --> 00:57:59,069
You hardly touched your chili,
your favorite food in the world,

723
00:57:59,070 --> 00:58:01,379
and now you don't want your breakfast?
Are you sick, honey?

724
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:04,679
I'm fine, I promise. Where's Dad?

725
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:08,049
Oh, he and "Miss I'll-just-have-half-a
grapefruit-thank-you".

726
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:12,640
left about an hour ago. You overslept
and he didn't want to wake you.

727
00:58:12,650 --> 00:58:14,219
Of course I'd probably oversleep too.

728
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:18,550
if I were up until midnight making mysterious
phone calls from my bathroom.

729
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:22,899
Oh. Oh, that? I was calling a
friend from camp. Mildred.

730
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:26,999
- She lives in New York.
- Oh, I see.

731
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,889
So you wanted to wait and call Mildred
at a time that was convenient for her

732
00:58:29,890 --> 00:58:31,109
because of the time difference?

733
00:58:31,110 --> 00:58:33,839
Exactly. Because... because
of the time difference.

734
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:37,979
Uh-huh? So you waited until it was
three in the morning her time?

735
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:39,879
That makes perfect sense.

736
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:45,419
Actually... it was seven at night her
time. You see, she lives in New York

737
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:48,950
but she was on vacation with
her family in Bora Bora.

738
00:58:50,990 --> 00:58:52,759
Mm-hm.

739
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:55,020
Very smooth.

740
00:58:56,130 --> 00:58:58,859
OK, look, smarty-pants, your father
wants you to meet him at his office

741
00:58:58,860 --> 00:58:59,939
as soon as you're done with breakfast.

742
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:02,469
He does? Thanks.

743
00:59:02,470 --> 00:59:04,400
I'm done.

744
00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:06,730
<font color=#ff00ff>- [SAMMY BARKS]</font>
- Whoa!

745
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:11,949
That dog has gotten so weird.

746
00:59:11,950 --> 00:59:15,700
Bye, Chessy. Thanks again
for breakfast. It was great.

747
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:19,239
Push, Hal.

748
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:22,510
Sorry. I... forgot.

749
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:31,399
Honey, I'm really glad you're here.

750
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:34,399
'Cause there's something really important
I want to talk to you about.

751
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:38,439
That's funny because there's something
really important I want to talk to you about.

752
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:41,109
- Yeah? Well, you go first.
- No, you.

753
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:45,879
OK. I want to talk to you about Meredith.

754
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:51,019
And I want to talk to you about my
mother. What about Meredith?

755
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:54,519
- Well, what about your mother?
- Dad, I'm almost 12.

756
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:58,429
How long do you expect me to buy that story
that the stork dropped me on your doorstep?

757
00:59:58,430 --> 01:00:01,599
Oh, come on, Hal. We've
talked about your mother.

758
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:03,769
No, we haven't. Not really.

759
01:00:03,770 --> 01:00:07,469
A girl needs more in life than half
a crumpled old photograph.

760
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:12,029
Dad, I'm almost a teenager.
Face it, I need a mother.

761
01:00:12,030 --> 01:00:15,479
You know what. You're right.
You're absolutely right.

762
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:19,300
You do need a mother, which brings me to...

763
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:22,819
- Meredith?
- Hi.

764
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:25,749
- Hello, Hal.
- Hi.

765
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:29,559
Hallie, this is my assistant Richard.
Richard, this is Nick's daughter.

766
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:30,929
The one I've been telling you so much about.

767
01:00:30,930 --> 01:00:33,899
- Oh, hello. How are you?
- Hi, there.

768
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:36,499
- Did you tell her?
- Almost.

769
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:39,939
Hey, if you're free later, why don't
we all have lunch on the terrace?

770
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:42,939
Well, actually, I promised Hal we'd
hang out together this afternoon.

771
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:46,809
Oh, no problem. I've got plenty to do.

772
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:52,379
I'm working on a new label design, Nicky,
featuring y-o-u You're going to love it.

773
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:56,849
- See you for dinner, darling. Bye, Hal.
- Bye.

774
01:00:56,850 --> 01:01:01,789
First change I make is to send that two-faced
little brat off to boarding school in Timbuktu.

775
01:01:01,790 --> 01:01:06,080
- Ooh. Ice woman.
- Proud of it, babe.

776
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:15,990
Come on, Dad.

777
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:24,309
OK, OK. You win. Hold up.
Give that horse a rest.

So, honey, you excited about our camping trip?

780

What camping trip?

781
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:36,619
What camping trip? The one we take every
summer before you go back to school.

Oh, oh, that camping trip.
Yeah, sure. I can't wait.

783
01:01:42,330 --> 01:01:44,720
So, Hal...

784
01:01:46,530 --> 01:01:49,239
- What do you think of Meredith?
- As what, Dad?

785
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:53,069
Your... your publicist? Your friend? Your...

786
01:01:53,070 --> 01:01:56,909
No, just what do you think of her, as a person?

787
01:01:56,910 --> 01:02:03,949
Well, she's cute. She has nice hair, good
teeth. She can spell the word "you".

788
01:02:03,950 --> 01:02:07,319
Honestly, Dad? The woman's
a complete stranger to me.

789
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:09,189
Why do you want my opinion anyway?

790
01:02:09,190 --> 01:02:12,229
I'll tell you why, Hal. Because, believe it or not...

791
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:14,650
Race you back to the ranch, Dad!

792
01:02:14,660 --> 01:02:16,569
Hal!

793
01:02:16,570 --> 01:02:19,990
Hal, I'm trying to tell you something.

794
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,930
Hey! Slow down.

795
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:51,599
I'm in so over my head here. I... I can't
handle this, I just... I just can't.

796
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:52,939
I'm only one kid. <font color=#ff00ff>[GASPS]</font>

797
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:55,969
You got something you want to
share with the class there, Hal?

798
01:02:55,970 --> 01:02:58,930
Chessy, you... you gave me a fright.

799
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:02,609
I gave you a fright?

800
01:03:02,610 --> 01:03:06,879
You scared me. I didn't know
you were, like... like in here.

801
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:10,640
Are you sure there isn't anything
you want to talk to me about?

802
01:03:11,990 --> 01:03:16,119
Like... why Sammy never
comes near you anymore.

803
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:20,499
or why your appetite's changed.

804
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:27,869
Or why all of a sudden you're neat as a pin and
using expressions like, "You gave me a fright."

805
01:03:27,870 --> 01:03:32,709
Chessy, I changed a lot over
the summer, that's all.

806
01:03:32,710 --> 01:03:34,160
OK.

807
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:39,330
Boy, if I didn't know any better, I'd
say it's almost like you were...

808
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:46,319
- Forget it. It's impossible.
- Almost as if I were who, Chessy?

809
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:52,020
- Nobody. Nobody. Forget I mentioned it.
- Almost as if I were... Annie?

810
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:03,089
You know about Annie?

811
01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:06,390
I am Annie.

812
01:04:07,210 --> 01:04:09,000
<font color=#FF551>NICK:</font> Hal.

813
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:12,649
Hal, why did you take off on me like that?

814
01:04:12,650 --> 01:04:15,900
I told you I wanted to talk
to you about something.

815
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:20,970
Chessy, why are you looking at her like that?

816
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:24,359
Like what? I'm not looking
at her any special way.

817
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:27,680
I'm looking at her like I've
looked at her for 11 years.

818
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:30,520
Since the day she came home from the hospital.

819
01:04:31,330 --> 01:04:36,499
Six pounds, 11 ounces. 21 inches
long. This is how I look at her.

820
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:38,960
Can I hug her?

821
01:04:40,970 --> 01:04:44,579
Oh, she's so beautiful.

822
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:46,970
And so big.

823
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:51,649
I'm going to make you something special
to eat. What would you like? Anything?

824
01:04:51,650 --> 01:04:56,210
You know what, it doesn't matter. I'm just
gonna go whip up everything we've got. OK?

825
01:04:57,220 --> 01:05:00,429
Hal, come here. Now.

826
01:05:00,430 --> 01:05:02,229
We have to talk.

827
01:05:02,230 --> 01:05:04,999
- OK. Shoot.
- OK.

828
01:05:05,670 --> 01:05:07,530
Honey...

829
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:14,039
I want to know what you think about
making Meredith part of the family.

830
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:18,349
- Part of our family?
- Yeah.

831
01:05:18,350 --> 01:05:20,839
- I think it's an awesome idea.
- Yeah?

832
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:22,369
- Inspired!
- You do?

833
01:05:22,370 --> 01:05:24,509
- Brilliant!
- Really? You do?

834
01:05:24,510 --> 01:05:28,759
Totally. I mean, like it's a dream come
true. I've always wanted a big sister.

835
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:30,750
Oh.

836
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:34,859
Um... honey, I think you're
kind of missing the point.

837
01:05:34,860 --> 01:05:38,169
No, I'm not. You're going to adopt Meredith.

838
01:05:38,170 --> 01:05:43,139
- That is so sweet, Dad.
- No, I am not going to adopt her.

839
01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:47,609
I'm... going to marry her.

840
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:49,739
Marry her? That's insane.

841
01:05:49,740 --> 01:05:52,849
How can you marry a woman young
enough to be my big sister?

842
01:05:52,850 --> 01:05:55,549
<i>Mais tu plaisantes, j'espère. Meredith,
ce n'est pas une fille pour toi.</i>

843
01:05:55,550 --> 01:05:57,919
<i>Mais c'est pas possible,
je rêve. Qu'est-ce qui...</i>

844
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:00,359
Calm down. Hal!

845
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:02,650
Are you speaking French?

846
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:06,529
I... I learned it at camp.

847
01:06:06,530 --> 01:06:08,999
OK. I'm sorry.

848
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:13,029
Let's... let's discuss this calmly.
Calmly and rationally.

849
01:06:13,030 --> 01:06:17,509
- Yeah, and in English, if you don't mind. Right?
- OK.

850
01:06:17,510 --> 01:06:20,069
Sweetheart, what has gotten into you?

851
01:06:20,070 --> 01:06:23,209
Nothing. Nothing. Just... just...

852
01:06:23,210 --> 01:06:28,100
Dad, you can't get married. It'll totally
ruin completely everything.

853
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:30,919
Hal. Hal.

854
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:32,780
Hallie.

855
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:37,110
Don't look at me. I don't know a thing.

856
01:06:37,590 --> 01:06:42,550
<font color=#ff00ff>[MUSIC BLASTS FROM CAR STEREO]</font>

857
01:06:51,670 --> 01:06:55,100
She thought I was going to adopt her?

858
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:59,009
- Hi, doll.
- Hi.

859
01:06:59,010 --> 01:07:02,240
Oh. You look stressed, baby.

860
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:08,119
- How about a martini?
- How about a double?

861
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:10,180
Coming right up.

862
01:07:11,390 --> 01:07:13,350
Chessy!

863
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:19,790
Don't you love it? It's just what we
need, it's such a big house. Chessy!

864
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:24,549
You rang?

865
01:07:24,550 --> 01:07:25,999
Two martinis, please.

866
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,930
And make Mr. Parker's a double.

867
01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:34,200
Chess, please. I'm getting a migraine.

868
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:41,019
- I told Hallie.
- You did? And?

869
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:42,419
She went ballistic.

870
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:46,019
She started yelling in French. I didn't
even know she spoke French.

871
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:48,959
- I don't know what's gotten into her.
- Oh, Nicky.

872
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:54,469
This reaction is totally classic. It's
"Daddy's Getting Remarried 101."

873
01:07:54,470 --> 01:07:57,839
I'd be worried if she didn't act this way.

874
01:07:57,840 --> 01:07:59,169
Look.

875
01:07:59,170 --> 01:08:03,079
Why don't I go talk to her? You
know, woman-to-woman.

876
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:07,319
I... I... I think she's a little...
sensitive about you right now.

877
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:11,780
That's why I need to do it. We've
got to break the ice sometime.

878
01:08:12,590 --> 01:08:17,780
Wear your shirt like this. I like it
when I can see a little chest hair.

879
01:08:32,210 --> 01:08:34,939
Knock, knock. Can I join you?

880
01:08:34,940 --> 01:08:36,870
Sure.

881
01:08:41,950 --> 01:08:44,789
Guess the news of the engagement
came as a bit of a shock, huh?

882
01:08:44,790 --> 01:08:46,289
Basically.

883
01:08:46,290 --> 01:08:49,719
You know, I remember what it was like to be 11.

884
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:53,659
I had my first beau at 11. It's a wonderful age.

885
01:08:53,660 --> 01:08:57,199
You're just starting to feel like
a woman and, believe it or not,

886
01:08:57,200 --> 01:09:00,669
soon you'll understand what
it's like to be in love.

887
01:09:00,670 --> 01:09:03,199
Me? I don't think so.

888
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:05,409
I don't even have my 12-year-old molars yet.

889
01:09:05,410 --> 01:09:10,209
Oh, well, take it from someone who
got their molars very early in life,

890
01:09:10,210 --> 01:09:15,119
being in love is a fantastic mystery
that takes a man and a woman...

891
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:19,119
I don't mean to be jerky when you're
trying to be all mushy and everything,

892
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:23,119
- but I know what mystery my dad sees in you.
- You do?

893
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:27,459
You're young and beautiful and sexy
and, hey, the guy's only human.

894
01:09:27,460 --> 01:09:32,469
But if you ask me, marriage is supposed to be
based on something more than just sex, right?

895
01:09:32,470 --> 01:09:36,439
Boy, your father underestimates you.

896
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:40,339
But you won't. Will you, Meredith?

897
01:09:40,340 --> 01:09:43,509
Being young and beautiful's
not a crime, you know.

898
01:09:43,510 --> 01:09:47,319
And for your 411, I adore your father.

899
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:51,549
He's exactly the kind of man I
always planned on marrying.

900
01:09:51,550 --> 01:09:55,849
This is the real deal, honey. And nothing
you do is going to come between us.

901
01:09:55,850 --> 01:10:00,629
Hate to break it to you, angel but you are no
longer the only girl in Nick Parker's life.

902
01:10:00,630 --> 01:10:03,989
- Get over it.
- If this is the real deal,

903
01:10:03,990 --> 01:10:09,299
then my dad's money has nothing to do
with you wanting to marry him, right?

904
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:12,699
OK, puss. You listen and you listen good.

905
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:16,309
I am marrying your father in two
weeks whether you like it or not.

906
01:10:16,310 --> 01:10:18,809
So I suggest you do not
tangle with me anymore.

907
01:10:18,810 --> 01:10:23,440
You are in way over your head. Is that clear?

908
01:10:24,150 --> 01:10:26,540
Crystal.

909
01:10:33,260 --> 01:10:35,959
<font color=#FF551>GRANDFATHER:</font> Martin! A refill, please.

910
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:40,950
...you must gone 3 inches
and I'd swear in 6 weeks.

911
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:44,639
- Lovely choice of wine, by the way, Martin.
- Thank you, sir.

912
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:49,270
- May I have a sip?
- I don't think you're going to like it.

913
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:04,289
Well, if you ask me, the bouquet's
a little too robust for a Merlot,

914
01:11:04,290 --> 01:11:08,580
but then again I'm partial to
the softer California grape.

915
01:11:11,470 --> 01:11:14,359
Has she learned about wine
at the summer camp?

916
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:16,190
She must have.

917
01:11:22,210 --> 01:11:26,179
- Darling! Are you all right?
- I had one sip too many, I guess.

918
01:11:26,180 --> 01:11:29,789
You know, Mother, I feel like
I could use a bit of fresh air.

919
01:11:29,790 --> 01:11:32,589
Would... would it be OK if I stepped
outside for a moment?

920
01:11:32,590 --> 01:11:34,489
Are you... are you OK? Would
you like me to go with you?

921
01:11:34,490 --> 01:11:39,150
Oh, no, no, no. I'll be fine. Just
got a touch woozy, that's all.

922
01:11:40,830 --> 01:11:42,850
Woozy, huh?

923
01:12:04,850 --> 01:12:08,680
Om, Yes, I'd like to place a collect
call to America, please.

924
01:12:09,220 --> 01:12:11,380
<font color=#ff00ff>[RINGS]</font>

925
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:13,629
- Hello?
- What's up?

926
01:12:13,630 --> 01:12:17,179
Hal, I'm desperate. Dad's getting married.

927
01:12:17,180 --> 01:12:18,429
What do you mean, getting married?

928
01:12:18,430 --> 01:12:21,719
I mean black tie, white gown,
the whole enchilada.

929
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:23,899
- What?
- <i>The wedding's in two weeks.</i>

930
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:28,129
If there's any hope of getting Mom and Dad
back together we've got to do it fast.

931
01:12:28,130 --> 01:12:29,709
And I mean really fast.

932
01:12:29,710 --> 01:12:32,979
OK. So Mom and I are going
out to the theater tonight.

933
01:12:32,980 --> 01:12:35,839
I'll... I'll drop the bomb on her
first thing in the morning.

934
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:37,619
<i>OK. Thanks.</i>

935
01:12:37,620 --> 01:12:41,540
- And, Hallie, hurry!
- OK. I will.

936
01:12:43,090 --> 01:12:44,829
Oh, excuse me, sir.

937
01:12:44,830 --> 01:12:48,329
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh. Yes.

938
01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:52,999
Now, what say you and I take a little
stroll in the park, eh, young lady?

939
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,960
OK.

940
01:12:55,770 --> 01:12:57,459
Now...

941
01:12:57,460 --> 01:13:02,039
- Come on, what's this all about?
- Well, it's a long story.

942
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:05,869
Well, it's a very big park and we've
got plenty of time, you know.

943
01:13:05,870 --> 01:13:07,879
Well, first of all...

944
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:12,449
<i><font color=#FF551>Elizabeth:</font> Féminine? Vraiment...
Je ne sais pas comment expliquer</i>

945
01:13:12,450 --> 01:13:15,089
<i>mais vous aurez le dessin demain, en tout cas.</i>

946
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:19,559
<i>En satin? Non, non, ce sera
quelque chose plus moderne</i>

947
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:24,929
<i>avec de la dentelle, du tulle blanc
très, très jeune, très léger.</i>

948
01:13:24,930 --> 01:13:27,360
Just do it, sweet pea.

949
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:32,229
<i>Non, c'est trop, non. Oui, mademoiselle,
vous aurez le dessin demain matin.</i>

950
01:13:32,230 --> 01:13:36,199
<i>Oui, tout à fait. Ne vous inquiétez
pas. Allez, au revoir.</i>

951
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:39,549
Darling, come in. I just have to finish
this sketch and fedex it off to Paris.

952
01:13:39,550 --> 01:13:41,719
Then how about you and I go out to lunch

953
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:45,549
and spend the rest of the day
getting lost in Harrods. Hm?

954
01:13:45,550 --> 01:13:49,309
I can't, Mom, I'm sorry. I... I have
to go out of town today.

955
01:13:49,310 --> 01:13:51,689
Oh, you have to go out of town?

956
01:13:51,690 --> 01:13:54,320
<font color=#ff00ff>[LAUGHING]</font> And where, may I ask, are you going?

957
01:13:54,730 --> 01:13:58,329
Annie. Annie.

958
01:13:58,330 --> 01:14:01,899
<font color=#ff00ff>[AMERICAN ACCENT]</font> That's where I
have to go. I have to go see Annie.

959
01:14:01,900 --> 01:14:08,160
- I see. And where might Annie be?
- In Napa. With her father Nick Parker.

960
01:14:16,150 --> 01:14:21,289
- You're not Annie.
- That would be correct.

961
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:23,980
You're Hallie?

962
01:14:25,490 --> 01:14:27,450
I am.

963
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:34,220
Annie and I met up at camp and
we decided to switch places.

964
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:41,379
I'm sorry, but I'd never seen you, and I dreamt
of meeting you my whole life and...

965
01:14:41,380 --> 01:14:47,609
Annie felt the exact same way about Dad,
so... so we sorta just switched lives.

966
01:14:47,610 --> 01:14:50,549
I hope you're not mad, because
I love you so much and...

967
01:14:50,550 --> 01:14:53,519
I just hope that one day
you can love me as me,

968
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:56,559
and not as Annie.

969
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:59,159
Oh, darling.

970
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:02,620

974
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:20,149
So, I...

975
01:15:20,150 --> 01:15:23,409
I guess you have to switch us back now, huh?

976
01:15:24,510 --> 01:15:30,719
Well, technically, you belong to your
dad and... Annie belongs to me.

977
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:36,029
His and hers kids. No offense, Mom,
but this arrangement really sucks.

978
01:15:36,030 --> 01:15:38,759
I agree. It totally sucks.

979
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:44,269
Then I say we fly to Napa, see Annie and
Dad, and work this whole thing out.

980
01:15:44,270 --> 01:15:48,439
And I say you're right. Not to worry,
darling. I'll take care of everything.

981
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:51,500
You're not to worry, OK?

982
01:15:55,250 --> 01:15:58,019
I'm sorry. I can't handle this.

983
01:15:58,020 --> 01:16:01,059
I mean, I haven't seen or heard from
Nick Parker in over 11 years,

984
01:16:01,060 --> 01:16:04,359
and suddenly I'm flying halfway
across the world to...

985
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:06,589
I'm not mature enough for this.

986
01:16:06,590 --> 01:16:09,959
If the man didn't make me so
nuts, I'd still be married to him.

987
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:11,969
I mean, we came up with
this arrangement so that

988
01:16:11,970 --> 01:16:16,069
we'd never have to see each other
again. I mean, look at me, Martin.

989
01:16:16,070 --> 01:16:17,559
Have you ever seen me like this?

990
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:19,569
- Well...
- Don't answer that.

991
01:16:19,570 --> 01:16:22,309
I mean, what if he doesn't recognize me?

992
01:16:22,310 --> 01:16:24,849
No, don't answer that, either.

993
01:16:24,850 --> 01:16:29,019
So, Hallie said he was a... a hunk.

994
01:16:29,020 --> 01:16:30,649
He was rather dishy.

995
01:16:30,650 --> 01:16:34,519
He had a smile that made me go weak
at the knees, if you can imagine that.

996
01:16:35,020 --> 01:16:38,789
- OK. I'm all set, Mom.
- Great. Me too. Almost.

997
01:16:38,790 --> 01:16:44,129
- Mom, your suitcase is, like, totally empty.
- Oh. Right. Sorry. Um...

998
01:16:44,130 --> 01:16:46,259
Did you speak to your father, dear?

999
01:16:46,260 --> 01:16:48,639
Um... yeah, yeah. I just hung
up with him, actually.

1000
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:51,409
He said he's really anxious to see you.

1001
01:16:51,410 --> 01:16:54,369
Anxious nervous, like he's totally,
completely dreading it?

1002
01:16:54,370 --> 01:16:57,409
Or anxious excited, like he's
looking forward to it?

1003
01:16:57,410 --> 01:17:00,349
- Anxious excited. Definitely.
- Oh.

1004
01:17:00,350 --> 01:17:04,689
He said he'll meet us tomorrow at noon
at the Stafford Hotel in San Francisco.

1005
01:17:04,690 --> 01:17:08,059
My, my, my. That's incredibly
soon, isn't it? Well. Um...

1006
01:17:08,060 --> 01:17:10,759

and gather up our tickets

somewhat childish request to make.

1011
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:24,269
Martin, you know that you're
more than a butler to me.

1012
01:17:24,270 --> 01:17:27,900
You're more like a lovable brother who
just happens to wait on us and...

1013
01:17:27,910 --> 01:17:30,969
- Anyway, I was wondering if...
- I'd accompany you on the trip?

1014
01:17:30,970 --> 01:17:34,209
- Make it a bit easier for you?
- Would you, Martin? Thank you so much.

1015
01:17:34,210 --> 01:17:37,749
I'd be so grateful. And you don't even have
to come as our butler, just as a friend.

1016
01:17:37,750 --> 01:17:41,359
Madam, I'd be honored. And
may I say, as a friend,

1017
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:46,580

years, and I had your legs...

1018

I'd wear this little baby.

1112
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:07,829
<font color=#FF551>ELIZABETH:</font> Chessy, this is our butler, Martin.

1113
01:24:07,830 --> 01:24:14,109
- How do you do? I'm her butler.
- <i>Enchanté, mademoiselle.</i>

1114
01:24:14,110 --> 01:24:18,900
Gee. The pleasure's all mine, monsieur.

1115
01:24:20,380 --> 01:24:25,429
Girls, you were going to tell me why you lied
and brought me here without telling your father.

1116
01:24:25,430 --> 01:24:27,629
Were they? OK, that's good. Uh...

1117
01:24:27,630 --> 01:24:31,089
Well, I'm just gonna go back to my room
and check out the old mini-bar situation.

1118
01:24:31,090 --> 01:24:33,669
- Allow me to assist you.
<font color=#FF551>- ELIZABETH:</font> Wait.

1119
01:24:34,270 --> 01:24:38,030
Does everyone here know
something I don't know?

1120
01:24:38,540 --> 01:24:42,930
Mom, Daddy's getting married.

1121
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:48,919
To Cruella De Vil. She's awful, Mom.
We can't let him go through with it.

1122
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:53,319
She's all wrong for him, Mom, and the
only way he won't marry her is if...

1123
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:56,080
You tell her. She knows you better.

1124
01:24:57,890 --> 01:25:00,659
Is if he sees you again.

1125
01:25:00,660 --> 01:25:04,799
Wait a minute. You're not trying
to set me up with your father?

1126
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:08,389
<font color=#FF551>HALLIE:</font> Actually, we are.
You're perfect for each other.

1127
01:25:08,390 --> 01:25:12,169
Hold it! You two knew about this?

1128
01:25:12,170 --> 01:25:14,569
- What? Oh! No.
- No.

1129
01:25:14,570 --> 01:25:19,609
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I had no idea.
- Madam, no, absolutely. I had no idea.

1130
01:25:19,610 --> 01:25:23,119
- Yes. Yes, I did know something.
- Yes. Technically, yes. I had an inkling.

1131
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:25,419
- Hallie told me the story.
- It was their idea. It was so sweet.

1132
01:25:25,420 --> 01:25:28,009
- I just fell for the story. I'm an old romantic.
- Yeah, so am I.

1133
01:25:28,010 --> 01:25:33,459
OK. OK. Let me say this loud and clear.

1134
01:25:33,460 --> 01:25:38,899
Nick Parker and I have absolutely
nothing in common... anymore.

1135
01:25:38,900 --> 01:25:41,369
Plus, in case you haven't noticed,
he seems extremely content

1136
01:25:41,370 --> 01:25:45,009
with his leggy, tight-skirted,
bare-backed fiancée.

1137
01:25:45,010 --> 01:25:47,009
And I want the two of you
to explain to your father

1138
01:25:47,010 --> 01:25:50,439
that I am here for one purpose,
and one purpose only.

1139
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:53,009
And that is to switch the two of you back.

1140
01:25:53,010 --> 01:25:56,209
Now, let's do what we have
to do and be done with it.

1141
01:25:56,210 --> 01:25:58,110
Understood?

1142
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:02,019
- Hey, Dad. What's up?
- Hi. Just running down to the lobby.

1143
01:26:02,020 --> 01:26:03,059
- Hey, Hal.
- Huh?

1144
01:26:03,060 --> 01:26:04,319
Do me a favor, will ya, while I'm gone?

1145
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:07,689
Will you just look after Meredith
for me? Huh? Thanks.

1146
01:26:07,690 --> 01:26:09,009
- Hallie. Hallie.
- Yeah?

1147
01:26:09,010 --> 01:26:11,529
How do I look? Like, presentable
and everything?

1148
01:26:11,530 --> 01:26:15,860
- Not too old?
- You look fab, Dad. Young and fab.

1149
01:26:23,940 --> 01:26:25,440
Dad.

1150
01:26:26,150 --> 01:26:28,319
I thought you were gonna
keep Meredith company.

1151
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:33,540
I was? I mean, I am, yeah. I was
just looking for her, actually.

1152
01:26:34,150 --> 01:26:36,219
It's great to see you, Dad.

1153
01:26:36,220 --> 01:26:39,280
It's great to see you too, squirt.

1154
01:26:40,490 --> 01:26:43,009
- Nice outfit.
- Oh, thanks.

1155
01:26:43,010 --> 01:26:45,599
Well, go on. Get up there. Come on.

1156
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:47,899
<i># Let's get together, yeah, yeah, yeah #</i>

1157
01:26:47,900 --> 01:26:50,239
<i># Why don't you and I combine? #</i>

1158
01:26:50,240 --> 01:26:52,709
<i># Let's get together... #</i>

1159
01:26:52,710 --> 01:26:55,039
- Have you seen your father?
- You talking to me?

1160
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:58,479
What, are you Robert De Niro?
Yes, I am talking to you.

1161
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:00,949
Oh, Meredith.

1162
01:27:00,950 --> 01:27:04,999
- Uh... yeah. I just saw him.
- Well, hello. Where was he?

1163
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,810
Uh... he went that way. I think.

1164
01:27:14,330 --> 01:27:17,859
- What are you staring at?
- Oh, nothing. Nothing.

1165
01:27:17,860 --> 01:27:21,399
You're just really very pretty. That's all.

1166
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:21,899
Oh...

1167
01:27:21,900 --> 01:27:26,069
Don't tell me you're gonna break your rotten
streak and suddenly be nice to me.

1168
01:27:26,070 --> 01:27:29,960
If you see your father, tell him
he's late and I'm waiting.

1169
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:34,830
Whatever you say, Cruella.

1170
01:27:36,250 --> 01:27:40,370
<font color=#ff00ff>[PIANO JAZZ]</font>

1171
01:27:41,220 --> 01:27:46,159
Here you go. This'll cure anything you've got.

1172
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:49,160
- Just don't ask what's in it.
- OK.

1173
01:27:50,460 --> 01:27:52,720
Here's to...

1174
01:27:53,170 --> 01:27:57,739
Here's to you. May your life be far
less complicated than mine.

1175
01:27:57,740 --> 01:27:59,439
Thank you.

1176
01:27:59,940 --> 01:28:01,860
Ugh.

1177
01:28:02,470 --> 01:28:05,200
- Martini, dry, please.
<font color=#ff00ff>- [BURPS]</font>

1178
01:28:05,250 --> 01:28:10,319
I beg your pardon. I... I think I just drank tar.

1179
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:14,219
There's your martini, and your bill, Miss James.

1180
01:28:14,220 --> 01:28:15,880
Thank you.

1181
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:27,020
You're Elizabeth James?

1182
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:30,039
- Guilty.
- Oh!

1183
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:34,839
I just saw a wedding dress you designed in
<i>Vogue</i> and fell completely in love with it.

1184
01:28:34,840 --> 01:28:37,199
I faxed your office just yesterday, and
they said that you were out of town

1185
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:41,499
and didn't know if you could make
another. I can't believe it. It's fate.

1186
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:44,889
- I'm Meredith Blake.
- How do you do?

1187
01:28:44,890 --> 01:28:47,610
<font color=#ff00ff>[CARIBBEAN-STYLE MUSIC]</font>

1188
01:28:55,830 --> 01:28:57,190
Sorry.

1189
01:29:02,170 --> 01:29:04,130
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

1190
01:29:05,940 --> 01:29:07,939
Where have you been? We've
been looking all over for you.

1191
01:29:07,940 --> 01:29:11,099
Nicholas, I think this hotel
is perfect for the wedding.

1192
01:29:11,100 --> 01:29:13,279
The more I see of it, the more I like it.

1193
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:15,379
Me too.

1194
01:29:15,380 --> 01:29:17,780
Absolutely.

1195
01:29:19,790 --> 01:29:24,019
Now, tell me, dear. How many are we
expecting from your side of the family?

1196
01:29:24,020 --> 01:29:25,750
Just a guesstimate.

1197
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:30,999
Uh... can I get back to you on that?
I... I'm not sure at the moment.

1198
01:29:31,300 --> 01:29:32,790
Excuse me.

1199
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:36,620
Pardon me. Sorry.

1200
01:29:38,300 --> 01:29:40,309
- Oh! Boss, you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1201
01:29:40,310 --> 01:29:43,009
<font color=#FF551>- MAN:</font> Uh... sir.
- Dad, watch out!

1202
01:29:43,010 --> 01:29:46,400
- Oh! Careful!
- Argh!

1203
01:30:08,230 --> 01:30:11,560
- Hello, Liz.
- Hello, Nick.

1204
01:30:13,170 --> 01:30:16,499
Well, gosh. There you are. What do you know?

1205
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:19,309
Uh... is there something going on
here that I should know about?

1206
01:30:19,310 --> 01:30:25,789
Because I'm stunned to see you, but, uh...
you don't seem as stunned to see me.

1207
01:30:25,790 --> 01:30:31,089
I mean, I haven't seen or heard from
you in, what, ten, eleven years.

1208
01:30:31,090 --> 01:30:33,829
- All of a sudden, on the very day that...
- Dad.

1209
01:30:33,830 --> 01:30:36,359
I can explain why she's here.

1210
01:30:36,360 --> 01:30:44,169
- Hallie, you know who this is?
- Actually, yes. And, actually, I'm not Hallie.

1211
01:30:44,170 --> 01:30:47,109
Actually, I am.

1212
01:30:47,810 --> 01:30:49,700
Both of them?

1213
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:54,479
Annie?

1214
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:55,719
Hallie?

1215
01:30:55,720 --> 01:30:59,449
I guess you and Mom kind of think alike,
'cause you both sent us to the same camp.

1216
01:30:59,450 --> 01:31:04,509
And, we met there, and the whole
thing just sort of... spilled out.

1217
01:31:04,510 --> 01:31:07,850
They switched places on us, Nick.

1218
01:31:08,660 --> 01:31:10,949
You mean I've had Annie with me all this time?

1219
01:31:10,950 --> 01:31:16,199
Well, I wanted to know what you were like,
and Hallie wanted to know Mom, and...

1220
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:20,669
- Are you angry?
- Oh, honey. Of course not.

1221
01:31:20,670 --> 01:31:23,660
I just can't believe it's you.

1222
01:31:26,240 --> 01:31:30,319
Last time I saw you, you had diaper
rash. Oh, sorry... you're all wet.

1223
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:32,710
- It's all right.
- Look at you.

1224
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:38,179
Well, I'm quite grown-up now,
and quite without a father.

1225
01:31:38,180 --> 01:31:40,849
And I'm headed into my crazy,
mixed-up teenage years,

1226
01:31:40,850 --> 01:31:45,060
and I'll be the only girl I know
without a mother to fight with.

1227
01:31:45,870 --> 01:31:49,099
Hallie, you've been in London all this time?

1228
01:31:49,100 --> 01:31:51,490
Come here, squirt.

1229
01:31:55,840 --> 01:32:01,019
Mom's amazing, Dad. I don't
know how you ever let her go.

1230
01:32:01,020 --> 01:32:05,889
Girls, why don't you let your father and
I talk alone for a couple of minutes, OK?

1231
01:32:05,890 --> 01:32:09,640
- Sure, fine.
- Take your time.

1232
01:32:10,260 --> 01:32:13,089
I don't believe this.

1233
01:32:13,090 --> 01:32:17,459
Seeing them together, seeing you.

1234
01:32:17,460 --> 01:32:19,999
- Ow.
- Ooh. Let me help you with that.

1235
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:23,830
- Oh, excuse me. Do you have a first-aid kit?
- Yeah, of course.

1236
01:32:24,740 --> 01:32:27,060
Why don't you lie down?

1237
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:30,900
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

1238
01:32:30,910 --> 01:32:34,679
So... how are you, Lizzie?

1239
01:32:34,680 --> 01:32:37,419
Or does everyone call you Elizabeth now?

1240
01:32:37,420 --> 01:32:40,289
Oh, no, no. Lizzie's... Lizzie's fine.

1241
01:32:40,290 --> 01:32:42,689
- My dad still calls me Lizzie.
- Yeah?

1242
01:32:42,690 --> 01:32:46,889
- Yeah, I've been... uh, been terrific.
- Oh.

1243
01:32:46,890 --> 01:32:50,529
You know, you haven't changed a bit.

1244
01:32:50,530 --> 01:32:56,169
Finally. There you are. Oh!
Uh... oh, good. You've met.

1245
01:32:56,170 --> 01:32:59,939
Honey, Elizabeth designs wedding gowns,
and she's going to make my...

1246
01:32:59,940 --> 01:33:03,839
Wait, um... I don't understand.
How did you two meet?

1247
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:08,379
- And, Nicky, why are you all wet?
- You're making my fiancée's wedding gown.

1248
01:33:08,380 --> 01:33:11,119
- Well, I didn't know she was your fiancée.
- Well...

1249
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:15,489
- How did we meet? How did you two meet?
- Am I missing something here?

1250
01:33:15,490 --> 01:33:18,359
Know what? This is one small world.

1251
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:19,659
How small?

1252
01:33:19,660 --> 01:33:22,089
- Hi, Mer.
- Hello.

1253
01:33:22,090 --> 01:33:25,259
- How you doing?
<font color=#ff00ff>- [SHRIEKS]</font>

1254
01:33:25,260 --> 01:33:29,639
Honey, did I ever mention to
you that Hallie was a twin?

1255
01:33:29,640 --> 01:33:32,909
No, I'm afraid you forgot that little detail.

1256
01:33:32,910 --> 01:33:36,439
Don't feel bad, Mer, he never
mentioned it to me, either.

1257
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:40,109
By the way, I'm the real Hallie. This is Annie.

1258
01:33:40,110 --> 01:33:43,779
She was pretending to be me, while
I was pretending to be her.

1259
01:33:43,780 --> 01:33:50,289
- And this is our mother, Elizabeth James.
- This is your mother?

1260
01:33:50,290 --> 01:33:51,419
<font color=#FF551>BOTH:</font> Yes.

1261
01:33:51,420 --> 01:33:53,729
You were married to him?

1262
01:33:53,730 --> 01:33:55,129
- Yeah.
- Guilty again.

1263
01:33:55,130 --> 01:33:59,559
- Oh, well. This is a small world.
- And getting smaller.

1264
01:33:59,560 --> 01:34:04,199
And what a coincidence that we're all
here on the exact same weekend.

1265
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:08,800
My, my, my. How sweet.

1266
01:34:14,190 --> 01:34:19,119
Hal, I've had enough surprises for one day. Will
you please just tell me where we're going?

Hey.

1270
01:34:33,060 --> 01:34:34,850
So...

1271
01:34:35,230 --> 01:34:37,999
Do you have any idea where they're taking us?

1272
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:41,360
- Not a clue.
- Right.

1273
01:34:58,820 --> 01:35:00,880
Where are we?

1274
01:35:04,760 --> 01:35:06,829
This is where we're eating?

1275
01:35:06,830 --> 01:35:09,299
No, actually,

1276
01:35:09,300 --> 01:35:12,530

<font color=#FF551>NICK:</font> Wow. So how exactly
are we paying for this?

1279
01:35:21,450 --> 01:35:23,779
Well, we pooled our allowances.

1280
01:35:23,780 --> 01:35:28,119
- Yeah, right, Annie.
- OK. Grandfather chipped in a bit.

1281
01:35:28,120 --> 01:35:31,359
- Annie.
- OK. He chipped in a lot.

Elizabeth and Nick, your dinner awaits you.

1284
01:35:47,870 --> 01:35:49,700
Girls.

1285
01:35:57,450 --> 01:35:59,619
The table's only set for two.

1286
01:35:59,620 --> 01:36:06,080
Oh. That's the other part of the
surprise. We're not joining you.

1287
01:36:06,660 --> 01:36:09,929
- You're not?
- No, but I am.

1288
01:36:09,930 --> 01:36:12,999
Good evening. I'm Chessy, and
I'll be your server this evening.

1289
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:16,299
- No wisecracks, please.
- And I am Martin, your sommelier.

1290
01:36:16,300 --> 01:36:20,529
May I offer you both a taste of the bubbly in
the hope that you'll get a bit schnockered

1291
01:36:20,530 --> 01:36:24,139
and not fire this lovely lady and myself

1292
01:36:24,140 --> 01:36:28,079
for following the orders of these
audacious 11-year-olds?

1293
01:36:28,080 --> 01:36:30,910
Annie, mood music, please.

met. The boat, the music...

1299
01:37:01,550 --> 01:37:03,649
The help.

Thank you, Martin.

1303
01:37:13,960 --> 01:37:15,860
Oh. Yeah.

1304
01:37:19,230 --> 01:37:24,069
To tell you the truth, I haven't
been on a boat since the <i>QE2.</i>

1305
01:37:24,070 --> 01:37:25,990
Neither have I.

- Well, then, here's to, uh...
- Our daughters.

You know, sometime if we're ever really alone,

1310
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:54,369
maybe we could... talk about
what happened between us.

1311
01:37:54,370 --> 01:37:56,969
It all feels a bit hazy to me now.

1312
01:37:56,970 --> 01:38:00,009
It ended so fast.

1313
01:38:00,010 --> 01:38:05,700
- It started so fast.
- Well, that part I remember perfectly.

1314
01:38:09,350 --> 01:38:14,289
Looks like things are heating up quite nicely.
I'd say it's safe to serve the vichyssoise.

You ladle, I'll serve.

- Right. And then I'll...

- Serve?
- Right.

01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:38,100
Right.

Your dream of owning your own
vineyard, it actually came true.

1321
01:38:48,290 --> 01:38:52,559
What about you? You were always drawing
on napkins and corners of newspapers.

1322
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:56,590
- Now you're this major designer.
- Yeah. It's great.

1323
01:38:57,700 --> 01:39:02,890
- We both actually got where we wanted to go.
- Yeah. We did.

1324
01:39:04,900 --> 01:39:08,469
Anyway, what are we going
to do about the girls?

1325
01:39:08,470 --> 01:39:11,609
Well, now that they've met, we
can't very well keep them apart.

1326
01:39:11,610 --> 01:39:14,879
Well, I could keep them for half the year,
and then you could keep them for...

1327
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:18,969
Guys, they can't go to two different
schools every year. That's nuts.

1328
01:39:18,970 --> 01:39:19,619
I agree.

1329
01:39:19,620 --> 01:39:21,949
Well, I could keep them both
for a whole year, and you...

1330

Oh. Sorry. Ignore me. Enjoy your soup.

01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:34,299
That's why we came up with
the solution that we have.

1334
01:39:34,300 --> 01:39:39,769
Really? I thought it was because we
decided never to see each other again.

1335
01:39:39,770 --> 01:39:41,669
Not "we," Liz.

1336
01:39:41,670 --> 01:39:45,979
Well, you know, that part's become
a bit hazy to me too over the years.

1337
01:39:45,980 --> 01:39:50,349
- You don't remember the day you packed?
- No, that day I remember perfectly.

1338
01:39:50,350 --> 01:39:54,349
Did I hurt you when I threw
that, um... what was it? A...

1339
01:39:54,350 --> 01:39:56,719
It was a hairdryer.

1340
01:39:56,720 --> 01:39:58,710
Oh. Right.

1341
01:39:59,120 --> 01:40:01,150
Sorry.

1342
01:40:03,530 --> 01:40:07,999
You know, I may never be alone with you again.

1343
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:13,069
So, about that day that you
packed... why'd you do it?

1344
01:40:13,070 --> 01:40:18,639
Oh, Nick. We were so young
and we both had tempers.

1345
01:40:18,640 --> 01:40:21,579
We said stupid things and so I packed.

1346
01:40:21,580 --> 01:40:24,800
Got on my very first 747 and...

1347
01:40:25,950 --> 01:40:28,619
you didn't come after me.

1348
01:40:29,320 --> 01:40:32,209
I didn't know that you wanted me to.

1349
01:40:34,210 --> 01:40:37,159
Well, it really doesn't matter anymore.

1350
01:40:37,160 --> 01:40:43,039
So let's just put a good face on for the girls
and get this show on the road, huh?

1351
01:40:43,040 --> 01:40:48,930
Yeah. Sure. Let's get this show on the road.

1352
01:40:55,650 --> 01:40:57,719
Your passport, Ms. James.
Have a safe trip home.

1353
01:40:57,720 --> 01:40:58,910
Thank you.

1354
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:03,359
- All set, then? Where's Annie?
- I just rang up. She's on her way down.

1355
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:05,280
Right.

1356
01:41:07,590 --> 01:41:12,990
- So I'll send Hallie back to you over Christmas.
- And Annie'll spend Easter with you.

1358
01:41:18,370 --> 01:41:21,169
Annie, what are you doing in those
clothes? We've got a plane to catch.

1359
01:41:21,170 --> 01:41:22,749
Here's the deal, Mom.

1360
01:41:22,750 --> 01:41:26,509
We thought it over, and we decided
we're being totally gypped.

1361
01:41:26,510 --> 01:41:31,049
Dad promised we'd go on our camping
trip, and we wanna go. Together.

1362
01:41:31,050 --> 01:41:32,279
What camping trip?

1363
01:41:32,280 --> 01:41:34,889
The one we go on every summer
before school starts.

1364
01:41:34,890 --> 01:41:37,359
Annie, this is ridiculous. Go upstairs
and put your clothes on.

1365
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:40,559
- Are you sure I'm Annie?
- Well, of course I'm sure.

1366
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:43,929
But it's kind of hard to be 100
percent positive, isn't it?

1367
01:41:43,930 --> 01:41:48,499
Girls, this is totally unfunny. You're gonna
make your mother miss her airplane.

1368
01:41:48,500 --> 01:41:50,790
- Annie.
<font color=#FF551>- BOTH:</font> Yes?

1369
01:41:58,110 --> 01:42:00,579
This one's Hallie. I'm positive.

1370
01:42:00,580 --> 01:42:02,449
You know, I hope you're right, Dad,

1371
01:42:02,450 --> 01:42:06,719
because you wouldn't wanna send the
wrong kid all the way back to England.

1372
01:42:06,720 --> 01:42:08,810
Would you?

1373
01:42:15,230 --> 01:42:17,590
Here's our proposition.

1374
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:24,739
We go back to Dad's house, pack our stuff,
and the four of us leave on the camping trip.

1375
01:42:24,740 --> 01:42:26,809
- The four of us?
- And when you bring us back,

1376
01:42:26,810 --> 01:42:28,569
we'll tell you who's Annie and who's Hallie.

1377
01:42:28,570 --> 01:42:32,339
Or you do as we say, and I take one
of you back with me to London,

1378
01:42:32,340 --> 01:42:35,340
whether you like it or not.

1379
01:42:41,050 --> 01:42:44,519
And what am I supposed to do for
three days? Sit home and knit?

1380
01:42:44,520 --> 01:42:47,329
Honey, we have kind of a sticky situation.

1381
01:42:47,330 --> 01:42:52,550
Sticky situation? What do you mean,
sticky situation? What exactly...?

1382
01:42:54,200 --> 01:42:56,899
Excuse me. What is she doing here?

1383
01:42:56,900 --> 01:43:01,139
You see, that's part of the deal.
The four of us, we go together.

1384
01:43:01,140 --> 01:43:03,279
What are you, suddenly the
Brady Bunch? This is ridic...

1385
01:43:03,280 --> 01:43:07,709
- Hello. Everything all right?
- Well, no, actually, it isn't.

1386
01:43:07,710 --> 01:43:11,199
I didn't realize that you were
going on this little outing,

1387
01:43:11,200 --> 01:43:14,389
and to tell you the truth I'm not
so sure that I'm OK with it.

1388
01:43:14,390 --> 01:43:16,119
I agree.

1389
01:43:16,120 --> 01:43:19,259
I think the ex-wife in the next
sleeping bag is a little weird.

1390
01:43:19,260 --> 01:43:22,729
- Thank you.
- I absolutely insist that you come with us.

1391
01:43:22,730 --> 01:43:24,799
- Really.

1392
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:29,029

- What?

01:43:48,120 --> 01:43:50,180
Be nice.

1397
01:44:01,870 --> 01:44:05,399
OK. All set? Have fun, everyone.

01:44:05,400 --> 01:44:08,239
- What?
- Liz, what are you doing?

1399
01:44:08,240 --> 01:44:12,579
Well, I really think that you and Meredith
need some time alone before the big day.

1400
01:44:12,580 --> 01:44:14,709
Mom, come on. That's not the plan.

1401
01:44:14,710 --> 01:44:17,109
Oh, honestly, you'll have much
more fun without me.

1402
01:44:17,110 --> 01:44:19,989
Wait, wait. If you're not going,
I certainly don't have to go.

1403
01:44:19,990 --> 01:44:22,519
I mean, trust me, I'm not a big nature girl.

1404
01:44:22,520 --> 01:44:24,689
But this is your chance to
really get to know the girls.

1405
01:44:24,690 --> 01:44:29,820
I mean, after all, starting next week
they're... they're half yours.

1406
01:44:34,970 --> 01:44:37,690
Have fun, all of you.

I'm gonna kill my trainer.

1414

He says I'm in such great shape.

1415

1425
01:45:57,280 --> 01:45:59,110
<font color=#ff00ff>[WHISPERS]</font> Brilliant.

1426
01:46:03,890 --> 01:46:05,980
Here you go, Mer.

1427
01:46:13,230 --> 01:46:15,869
Honey, you OK?

1428
01:46:15,870 --> 01:46:19,839
- What happened?
- This little guy was on her Evian bottle.

1429
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:22,739
Oh. He won't hurt you, Mer.

1430
01:46:22,740 --> 01:46:28,149
Oh, right, right, right. I...
I know. You... go ahead.

1431
01:46:28,150 --> 01:46:31,019
I'll be fine.

1432
01:46:31,020 --> 01:46:35,519
Get that thing away from me.
I hate things that crawl. Ugh.

1433
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:40,950
- How can you touch that?... Put it down.
- OK, OK, I'll put it down.

1434
01:46:44,060 --> 01:46:45,119
<font color=#FF551>- NICK:</font> Girls...
- What?

1435
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:47,599
- What?
- I'm going to take the lead.

1436
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:50,539
The two of you help Meredith. All right?

1437
01:46:50,540 --> 01:46:55,290
Sure you'll help me. Right
over a cliff, you'll help me.

1438
01:46:55,910 --> 01:46:58,429
- Not a bad idea.
- Yeah. See any cliffs?

1439
01:46:58,430 --> 01:47:01,379
Oh, my backpack.

1440
01:47:01,380 --> 01:47:03,570
Need a hand, Mer?

1441
01:47:04,580 --> 01:47:07,219
Not from you, thank you.

1442
01:47:07,220 --> 01:47:10,519
Don't think I can't see right
past those angelic faces.

1443
01:47:10,520 --> 01:47:14,289
One more trick from you two and I promise
I will make your lives miserable

1444
01:47:14,290 --> 01:47:17,749
from the day I say, "I do".

1445
01:47:17,750 --> 01:47:19,750
Got it?

1446
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:23,320
Got it, Cruella.

1447
01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:26,490
What did you call me?

1448
01:47:27,540 --> 01:47:30,809
<font color=#FF551>HALLIE:</font> Nothing, nothing. Not a thing, Cruella.

1449
01:47:30,810 --> 01:47:33,029
Oh, by the way, Mer,

1450
01:47:33,030 --> 01:47:36,540
I think there's something on your head.

1451
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:52,990
Are you all right?

1452
01:47:56,860 --> 01:47:59,660
What... happened?

1453
01:48:01,270 --> 01:48:04,030
Ask them.

1454
01:48:04,540 --> 01:48:06,130
<font color=#ff00ff>[COUGHS]</font>

1455
01:48:09,110 --> 01:48:12,770
What did we do, Dad? We were right behind you.

1456
01:48:14,650 --> 01:48:17,419
- This is really good.
- Yeah, I know.

1457
01:48:17,420 --> 01:48:21,420
Here we go, girls. This'll hold us for a while.

1458
01:48:25,700 --> 01:48:27,729
Sure you don't want some trout, Mom?

1459
01:48:27,730 --> 01:48:30,699
Is that OK, by the way, if we
start calling you Mom?

1460
01:48:30,700 --> 01:48:33,839
I think your mother would prefer
if you called me Meredith.

1461
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:39,909
And no, thank you, I do not eat
trout, for the thousandth time.

1462
01:48:39,910 --> 01:48:42,809
I will wait until breakfast. What are we having?

1463
01:48:42,810 --> 01:48:45,079
<font color=#FF551>- ALL:</font> Trout.
- Oh.

1464
01:48:45,080 --> 01:48:48,379
- Come on, it's part of the experience.
- Mm, and what's the other part?

1465
01:48:48,380 --> 01:48:52,819
Being eaten to death by mosquitoes? God,
you'd think they actually like this stuff.

1466
01:48:52,820 --> 01:48:56,520
Well, what's that you're using?
Here, let me see that.

1467
01:49:00,590 --> 01:49:04,639
You're gonna attract every mosquito in the
state with this stuff. It's sugar and water.

1468
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:07,260
Where'd you get it?

1469
01:49:08,370 --> 01:49:14,770
That's it. I am taking one large
sleeping pill and going to bed.

1470
01:49:20,720 --> 01:49:22,180
Meredith?

1471
01:49:22,690 --> 01:49:24,589
What are you doing?

1472
01:49:24,590 --> 01:49:27,250
I don't want the mountain lions to...

1473
01:49:29,160 --> 01:49:32,950
There are no mountain lions up here, are there?

1474
01:49:33,460 --> 01:49:35,220
No.

1475
01:49:51,080 --> 01:49:53,310
Good night.

1476
01:49:57,460 --> 01:50:00,949
Girls, I'm telling you, lay off.

1477
01:50:00,950 --> 01:50:04,829
This isn't her thing, OK? I'm not marrying
her because she's Annie Oakley.

1478
01:50:04,830 --> 01:50:09,420
- Who's Annie Oakley?
- Just cool it.

1479
01:50:26,150 --> 01:50:29,110
- Come on, come on.
<font color=#FF551>- ANNIE:</font> OK.

1483
01:50:46,150 --> 01:50:51,400

- She's also, like, snoring.

1484
01:50:59,350 --> 01:51:01,310
Nicky?

1485
01:51:28,610 --> 01:51:31,440
Sweet dreams, Mommy dearest.

1486
01:51:49,770 --> 01:51:52,390
That feels nice.

1487
01:52:02,050 --> 01:52:05,540
Nicky!

Ooh.

1491
01:52:27,970 --> 01:52:31,429
- What's going on?
- Here's what's going on, buddy.

1492
01:52:31,430 --> 01:52:34,939
The day we get married is the day I
ship those brats off to Switzerland.

1493
01:52:34,940 --> 01:52:38,769
Get the picture? It's me or them.

1494
01:52:38,770 --> 01:52:40,910
Take your pick.

1495
01:52:42,120 --> 01:52:44,489
Them.

1496
01:52:44,490 --> 01:52:49,150
- Excuse me?
- T-h-e-m, them.

1497

Hello. You're back so soon. Did you have fun?

1501
01:53:13,170 --> 01:53:17,079
- Well, I wouldn't go right to fun.
- You wouldn't?

1502
01:53:17,080 --> 01:53:19,459
We've been punished to the end of the century.

1503
01:53:19,460 --> 01:53:21,429
Starting now.

1504
01:53:21,430 --> 01:53:24,549
- Go.
- Where's Meredith?

1505
01:53:24,550 --> 01:53:28,729
We played a couple of harmless tricks on
her and she kind of freaked out a little.

1506
01:53:28,730 --> 01:53:30,669
<font color=#FF551>NICK:</font> A little?

1507
01:53:30,670 --> 01:53:32,590
Hm.

1508
01:53:33,200 --> 01:53:36,779
She threw this at my head.

1509
01:53:36,780 --> 01:53:39,600
Least it's smaller than a hairdryer.

1510
01:53:39,610 --> 01:53:42,779
Oh, Nick, it's all my fault. If I
hadn't suggested she go...

1511
01:53:42,780 --> 01:53:46,170
Oh, tricked. Tricked would be more like it.

1512
01:53:46,180 --> 01:53:48,289
Like mother, like daughters.

1513
01:53:48,290 --> 01:53:50,619
I... I really am sorry.

1514
01:53:50,620 --> 01:53:52,979
We are too, Dad. Really.

1515
01:53:52,980 --> 01:53:56,620
- Yeah.
- Up to your room. Now.

1516
01:54:02,130 --> 01:54:05,390
I gotta remember to thank them one day.

1517
01:54:08,640 --> 01:54:11,930
So, where's Chessy? I'm starving.

1518
01:54:12,440 --> 01:54:17,949
Well, she and Martin went off on a
picnic around noon... yesterday.

1519
01:54:17,950 --> 01:54:23,289
Really? Who would have thought?
My nanny, your butler. Hm.

1520
01:54:23,290 --> 01:54:26,459
So, what do you say I whip
us up something to eat?

1521
01:54:26,460 --> 01:54:30,359
- You can cook now?
- Oh, yeah. I can make pasta

1522
01:54:30,360 --> 01:54:32,259
and pasta and...

1523
01:54:32,260 --> 01:54:36,760
- Pasta sounds good.
- Then pasta it is.

1524
01:54:42,310 --> 01:54:44,960
<font color=#FF551>ANNIE:</font> OK, I'll take two.

1525
01:54:45,780 --> 01:54:50,209
- Hey, Dad.
- Wow, you look so nice.

1526
01:54:50,210 --> 01:54:51,909
Where are you going?

1527
01:54:51,910 --> 01:54:55,070
Good night, ladies.

1528
01:55:02,430 --> 01:55:06,869
- Oh, wow.
- This is where I keep my private stash.

1529
01:55:06,870 --> 01:55:09,529
Did you know I also collect wine?

1530
01:55:09,530 --> 01:55:13,120
- Really?
- Mm. I'm a man of limited interests. Come here.

1531
01:55:15,370 --> 01:55:19,539
This is a 1921 Burgundy.

1532
01:55:19,540 --> 01:55:23,549
They say the rain that year made this
the best Burgundy ever harvested.

1533
01:55:23,550 --> 01:55:25,439
Oh.

1534
01:55:25,440 --> 01:55:28,710
Now, you will appreciate this. Come here.

1535
01:55:37,760 --> 01:55:39,550
Look.

1536
01:55:39,960 --> 01:55:43,429
V-J Day 1945.

1537
01:55:43,430 --> 01:55:46,690
- That's incredible.
- I love that.

1538
01:55:51,540 --> 01:55:55,009
Now, this is the same wine that was
served at my parents' wedding.

1539
01:55:55,010 --> 01:55:57,079
Bordeaux, '52.

1540
01:55:57,080 --> 01:56:00,940
I think my sister was conceived on this baby.

1541
01:56:02,650 --> 01:56:07,359
What's this one? "Where dreams have no end".

1542
01:56:07,360 --> 01:56:09,459
1983.

1543
01:56:09,460 --> 01:56:12,399
That one, actually, took me years to track down.

1544
01:56:12,400 --> 01:56:14,660
Why? Where's it from?

1545
01:56:15,870 --> 01:56:20,560
It's the wine that we drank at our wedding.

1546
01:56:21,700 --> 01:56:25,500
I now have every bottle ever made.

1547
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,300
You do?

1548
01:56:28,950 --> 01:56:30,770
I do.

1549
01:56:33,550 --> 01:56:38,480
- Can we open one?
- You're the only one I'd drink it with.

1550
01:56:40,860 --> 01:56:43,329
- You OK?
- Oh, yeah.

1551
01:56:43,330 --> 01:56:45,799
- Just got a little dust in my eye, that's all.
- Han!

1552
01:56:45,800 --> 01:56:49,699
- I can offer you a clean sleeve.
- No, no, I'm fine, really.

1553
01:56:49,700 --> 01:56:51,530
All better.

1554
01:56:53,340 --> 01:56:57,009

be so brave, you know.

1555

02:00:40,400 --> 02:00:43,729
for us to realize we didn't
wanna lose you two again.

1590
02:00:43,730 --> 02:00:45,960
We?

1591
02:00:49,510 --> 02:00:51,600
We.

1592
02:00:52,510 --> 02:00:56,549
I made the mistake of not coming
after you once, Lizzie.

1593
02:00:56,550 --> 02:01:00,640
I'm not gonna do that again, no
matter how brave you are.

1594
02:01:01,350 --> 02:01:06,189
And I suppose you just expect me to go weak
at the knees and fall into your arms

1595
02:01:06,190 --> 02:01:09,559
and cry hysterically and say, "We'll
just figure this whole thing out."

1596
02:01:09,560 --> 02:01:16,269
A bicontinental relationship with our daughters
being raised here and... and there and...

1597
02:01:16,270 --> 02:01:21,689
and you and I just picking
up where we left off...

1598
02:01:21,690 --> 02:01:25,009
and growing old together and...

1599
02:01:25,510 --> 02:01:26,970
and....

1600
02:01:27,780 --> 02:01:30,699
Come on, Nick, what do you expect?

1601
02:01:30,700 --> 02:01:33,379
- To live happily ever after?
- Yes.

1602
02:01:33,380 --> 02:01:35,649
To all the above.

1603
02:01:35,650 --> 02:01:39,319
Except you don't have to cry hysterically.

1604
02:01:39,320 --> 02:01:42,220
Oh, yes, I do.

1605
02:02:18,930 --> 02:02:22,570
We actually did it.

1606
02:02:22,670 --> 02:02:26,399
<i># This will be an everlasting love #</i>

1607
02:02:26,400 --> 02:02:30,339
<i># This will be the one I've waited for #</i>

1608
02:02:30,340 --> 02:02:31,929
<i># This will be #</i>

1609
02:02:31,930 --> 02:02:37,879
<i># The first time anyone has loved me #</i>

1610
02:02:37,880 --> 02:02:41,889
<i># I'm so glad you found me in time #</i>

1611
02:02:41,890 --> 02:02:45,619
<i># And I'm so glad that you rectified my mind #</i>

1612
02:02:45,620 --> 02:02:47,759
<i># This will be #</i>

1613
02:02:47,760 --> 02:02:51,499
<i># An everlasting love for me, yeah #</i>

1614
02:02:51,500 --> 02:02:53,099
<i># Whoa #</i>

1615
02:02:53,100 --> 02:02:57,029
<i># Loving you is some kind of wonderful #</i>

1616
02:02:57,030 --> 02:03:01,169
<i># Because you've shown me
just how much you care #</i>

1617
02:03:01,170 --> 02:03:04,339
<i># You've given me the thrill of a lifetime #</i>

1618
02:03:04,340 --> 02:03:07,949
<i># And made me believe you've
got more thrills to spare #</i>

1619
02:03:07,950 --> 02:03:10,279
<i># Oh, this will be #</i>

1620
02:03:10,280 --> 02:03:16,010
<i># An everlasting love
Oh, yes, it will, now #</i>

1621
02:03:20,090 --> 02:03:23,889
<i># You've brought a lot of
sunshine into my life #</i>

1622
02:03:23,890 --> 02:03:27,599
<i># You've filled me with happiness
I never knew #</i>

1623
02:03:27,600 --> 02:03:30,629
<i># You gave me more joy
than I ever dreamed of #</i>

1624
02:03:30,630 --> 02:03:34,869
<i># And no one, no one can
take the place of you #</i>

1625
02:03:34,870 --> 02:03:36,839
<i># This will be #</i>

1626
02:03:36,840 --> 02:03:38,379
<i># You and me #</i>

1627
02:03:38,380 --> 02:03:40,409
<i># Yes, sirree #</i>

1628
02:03:40,410 --> 02:03:42,149
<i># Eternally #</i>

1629
02:03:42,150 --> 02:03:43,919
<i># Hugging and squeezing
and kissing and pleasing #</i>

1630
02:03:43,920 --> 02:03:46,379
<i># Together, forever, through
rain or whatever #</i>

1631
02:03:46,380 --> 02:03:49,589
<i># Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you and me #</i>

1632
02:03:49,590 --> 02:03:51,619
<i># So long as I'm living,
true love I'll be giving #</i>

1633
02:03:51,620 --> 02:03:53,759
<i># To you I'll be serving 'cause
you're so deserving #</i>

1634
02:03:53,760 --> 02:03:56,929
<i># Hey, you're so deserving #</i>

1635
02:03:56,930 --> 02:04:06,760
<i># From now on, from now on,
from now on, from now on #</i>
