a lot of wars

that when we land,

we might run
into some nasty windstorms.

that everything's just peachy

to reconsider a $40 billion mission

01:01:29,602 --> 01:01:30,686
JULIE: Fred!

854
01:01:30,895 --> 01:01:33,230
BILL: How'd you like to be
the first guy to die on Mars?

855
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:37,984
FRED: Well, sorry, Mr. First
To Show Inappropriate Anger On Mars!

856
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:40,779
BILL: I'm not listening, Randall.
I'm turning this radio off.

857
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,907
FRED: Well, you're the first
to not listen to me on Mars.

858
01:01:44,075 --> 01:01:46,159
- BILL: Na, na, na, na, na.
- FRED: Please talk to me.

859
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:50,831
I wanna get to know you
more for the first time on Mars.

860
01:01:56,754 --> 01:01:58,630
- FRED: Are we there yet?
- BILL: No.

861
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:00,799
- FRED: Can I drive?
- BILL: No!

862
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:03,093
- FRED: You never let me drive!
- BILL: Shut up.

863
01:02:04,178 --> 01:02:07,431
FRED: Hey, there's no airbag.
What if I flying through the windshield?

864
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:09,808
BILL: Randall,
there is no windshield.

865
01:02:10,101 --> 01:02:13,562
FRED: Oh. Well, what if I go flying
through the front of my helmet?

866
01:02:14,313 --> 01:02:15,772
BILL: I'd die happy.

867
01:02:19,318 --> 01:02:22,154
Well, this is it. Valles Marineris.

868
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:24,614
Stop here, Ford.
This'll be perfect.

869
01:02:26,784 --> 01:02:28,285
This is where we plant the flag.

870
01:02:28,786 --> 01:02:29,828
JULIE: Roger.

871
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:32,372
I'll set up the weather station,
and take the drilling samples

872
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:33,665
and be back in an hour.

873
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:40,797
BILL: I'll offload this equipment.

874
01:02:41,966 --> 01:02:43,884
Rendezvous back here at 1400 hours.

875
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:45,594
JULIE: Fourteen hundred hours. Check.

876
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:47,637
BILL: Be careful out there, Ford.

877
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:58,356
FRED: All right, this is the spot.
It's the perfect spot right here.

878
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:01,943
What you doing, Randall?
Where's that flag?

879
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:03,862
FRED: It's coming, Commander.

880
01:03:07,492 --> 01:03:09,451
FRED: Uh-oh, it wasn't me!

881
01:03:10,036 --> 01:03:12,162
But I'll get it!
I think I saw where it went.

882
01:03:17,251 --> 01:03:20,837
BILL: Hey, hey, hey, hey!
No, no, no, no, no.

883
01:03:21,547 --> 01:03:22,923
You moron!

884
01:03:23,257 --> 01:03:24,841
FRED: Who are you talking to,
Commander?

885
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,260
BILL: You realize
what you've just done?

886
01:03:28,679 --> 01:03:30,722
I waited my whole life
for this moment,

887
01:03:31,432 --> 01:03:33,725
to plant a flag on a distant planet.

888
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:37,312
Now I'm on a distant planet,
which was the hard part...

889
01:03:38,105 --> 01:03:40,357
and I don't have a flag
'cause you lost it!

890
01:03:41,609 --> 01:03:44,236
FRED: Don't worry, Commander!
I've got another flag!

891
01:03:44,529 --> 01:03:50,116
A high-flying flag! A proud flag!
A wonderful flag!

892
01:03:50,743 --> 01:03:52,077
BILL: What are you doing?

893
01:03:52,954 --> 01:03:54,871
FRED: We're making history,
Commander!

894
01:03:57,124 --> 01:03:58,333
BILL: Randall.

895
01:04:01,546 --> 01:04:02,796

896
01:04:05,716 --> 01:04:07,217

- FRED: Ten-hut!

- MAN 2: It's the president.

898

throw myself off this cliff?

899
01:04:16,602 --> 01:04:19,646
- BILL: Why don't I throw you off?
- FRED: Don't worry, they're clean.

900
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:24,818
Paul, we got a red on Overbeck.

901
01:04:25,027 --> 01:04:27,779
We have a primary oxygen tank leak.
We need to preserve his SOP.

902
01:04:28,281 --> 01:04:29,281
Solution?

903
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:32,284
Emergency tie line.
We hook him into another suit.

904
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:33,869
Do it, doc.

905
01:04:34,453 --> 01:04:37,497
Bill, this is Houston. You got
a leak in your primary O2 tank.

906
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:40,542
I see it. What do we do?

907
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:42,711
MAN 3: You got an emergency line
in your flix,

908
01:04:42,837 --> 01:04:44,421
hook it up
with Randall's spare vent nozzle

909
01:04:44,589 --> 01:04:46,047
and your share
till you get back to the Pilgrim.

910
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:49,092
Houston, is that sanitary?

911
01:04:52,763 --> 01:04:54,764
- FRED: Hey, Commander?
- BILL: Yeah?

912
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:58,310
FRED: Do you believe in UFOs at all?

913
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:00,437
BILL: Sure, I believe in UFOs.

914
01:05:00,688 --> 01:05:01,771
FRED: You do?

915
01:05:02,064 --> 01:05:04,691
BILL: Yeah. There's one following me.

916
01:05:05,192 --> 01:05:08,737
FRED: Huh? Oh, I get it!
You're funny, Commander!

918
01:05:13,993 --> 01:05:15,035
FRED: Hey, Commander?

919
01:05:15,786 --> 01:05:16,953
BILL: Yeah?

920
01:05:17,204 --> 01:05:18,705
FRED: When I was a kid...

921
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:22,167
at night I used to there was
a baker under my bed.

922
01:05:22,668 --> 01:05:24,753
Did you ever have anything
under your bed?

923
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:28,506
- BILL: No.
- FRED: Did you ever bend down and look?

924
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:30,383
BILL: No.

925
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:33,511
FRED: Well, how do you know
there wasn't a baker under your bed?

926
01:05:33,804 --> 01:05:35,347
BILL: Randall, shut up.

927
01:05:36,057 --> 01:05:37,057
FRED: Hey, Commander?

928
01:05:37,642 --> 01:05:38,725
BILL: Yeah?

929
01:05:39,143 --> 01:05:43,021
FRED: I seem to be experiencing these
intense intestinal cramps.

930
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:46,483
FRED: Randall, I'm trying
to conserve oxygen here.

931
01:05:46,817 --> 01:05:49,110
- FRED: But they hurt me so.
- BILL: Keep it to yourself.

932
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:51,613
- FRED: Ow. Ow.
- BILL: Wait a minute.

933
01:05:52,823 --> 01:05:54,950
BILL: If we stay on this heading
for another 20 minutes,

934
01:05:55,117 --> 01:05:56,242
we'll see the Pilgrim.

I didn't do anything.

Oh, my God. No, no, no.

938
01:06:14,845 --> 01:06:17,430
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Don't do that.

939
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:19,849

- It wasn't me.
- What do you mean, it wasn't you?

This isn't good, Bill.
I think Fred's right.

963
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:57,822
Looks like the winds
are coming early.

964
01:07:57,990 --> 01:08:00,992
Maybe two or three days.
Look at these readings I took today.

965
01:08:01,243 --> 01:08:02,577
We should still be all right tomorrow.

966
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:05,622
Oh no, wait a second. No.
It's not gonna be all right.

FRED: My calculations are telling me

968
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:10,710
that... that these two martian
high-pressure systems

969
01:08:10,878 --> 01:08:13,630
are coming together faster
than any of us could've predicted.

970

Tomorrow.

971
01:08:15,633 --> 01:08:18,093
When that happens, we're nothing more
than a dust bunny,

972
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:19,803
stuck in a bag of a vacuum.

973

You go out there,
you're not comin' back.

01:08:22,306 --> 01:08:25,308
What are you doing, Randall?
What are you doing?

975
01:08:25,976 --> 01:08:28,853
What, it's not enough that you broke
every record that I ever set?

976
01:08:29,021 --> 01:08:32,065
That you humiliated me
on global television?

977
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:34,609
That you ruined what should've been
the most important moment

978
01:08:34,777 --> 01:08:36,820
of my life by stepping on Mars first?

979

Wait. Bill...

984
01:08:49,708 --> 01:08:53,086
I don't want to abort this mission
any more than you do, but...

985

I know he's right.

993
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:33,084
FRED: He said we should wait
till morning. You know, Bud,

994
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:37,422
maybe I was wrong about the winds.
Maybe I shouldn't have said anything.

995
01:09:37,631 --> 01:09:40,466
BUD: I wanna tell you something,
Fred. About the 13 mission.

996
01:09:42,052 --> 01:09:44,053
The day before launch,
I... I caught what seemed to be

997
01:09:44,263 --> 01:09:46,723
a minor glitch
in the tank's stirring circuits.

998
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:49,392
Didn't look serious,
but I went to Wick,

999
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:52,729
I told him, we needed to postpone until we
could greenlight the system.

1000
01:09:53,397 --> 01:09:55,732
He said, there was no way
we were gonna push back the launch date,

1001
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:57,275
he said that I was overreacting,

1002
01:09:57,484 --> 01:09:59,777
that I was imagining a problem
when there was none.

1003
01:10:00,404 --> 01:10:02,614
FRED: So Apollo 13
was Wick's fault?

1004
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:05,742
BUD: No. I had every right
and authority to stop that launch

1005
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:07,827
but I didn't. I didn't make the call.

1006
01:10:08,746 --> 01:10:10,580
And if those three astronauts
hadn't pulled off

1007
01:10:10,831 --> 01:10:12,332
a number
of last minute major miracles,

1008
01:10:12,499 --> 01:10:14,959
they would have been dead
and it would've been my fault.

1009
01:10:15,836 --> 01:10:17,712
I'm not gonna let that happen
this time.

1010
01:10:18,464 --> 01:10:20,215
I'm gonna get you guys out of this.

1011
01:10:21,425 --> 01:10:23,218
- Hey, Bud.
- BUD: What?

1012
01:10:23,469 --> 01:10:25,345
I'd be proud to end up like you.

1013
01:10:27,139 --> 01:10:28,223
I copy that.

1014
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:31,184
Bud out.

01:10:31,936 --> 01:10:33,019

1016
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:37,482
- FRED: are coming! Get them away!
- JULIE: Fred! Wake up! Fred! Fred!

1017
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,818
Bill's gone. He took Ulysses
and the spare backpack,

1018
01:10:40,986 --> 01:10:42,111
and he is gone.

1019
01:10:42,446 --> 01:10:44,280
Sweet mother of meat!

1020
01:10:47,034 --> 01:10:49,202
(IMITATES SCOOBY-DOO)
Huh? Uh-oh!

1021
01:10:55,167 --> 01:10:57,835
BILL: All right, buddy. Here we are.

1022
01:11:00,506 --> 01:11:02,590
Go on... Go on.

1023
01:11:09,598 --> 01:11:10,723
How are they doing up there, Paul?

1024
01:11:11,058 --> 01:11:13,434
Oh, good morning, sir.
Yes, we're just about to wake the crew.

1025
01:11:13,602 --> 01:11:15,478
- Would you like this one, sir?
- (DOOR OPENS)

1026
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:17,272
Oh, great.

1027
01:11:20,609 --> 01:11:21,693
It's over, Paul.

1028
01:11:22,403 --> 01:11:23,778
Sir, I'm making the call.
We abort now.

1029
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:26,531
No one's listening to you, Bud.
Don't make me call security.

1030
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:28,992
I'm not gonna stand by
and let another disaster happen!

1031
01:11:29,159 --> 01:11:32,287
This man has continually ignored
the warnings of our crew on Mars.

1032
01:11:32,454 --> 01:11:35,331
- Security, would you come in here, please?
- Our mission is in serious jeopardy, sir.

1033
01:11:35,666 --> 01:11:36,708
Bud...

1034
01:11:41,046 --> 01:11:42,755
Don't make this any harder
than it already is.

1035
01:11:42,923 --> 01:11:45,300
- Don't do this, sir.
- BEN: Bud, would you take it easy?

1036
01:11:45,509 --> 01:11:48,136
We're all under a lot of stress.
You just need to rest. That's all!

1037
01:11:48,387 --> 01:11:52,640
- Ben, those people are gonna die.
- Bud, you have totally lost it.

1038
01:11:53,058 --> 01:11:55,268
We haven't had any negative reports.

1039
01:11:56,186 --> 01:11:57,478
Get him out of here, please.

1040
01:11:58,188 --> 01:12:00,440
Paul, we've got a contact
on emergency frequency.

1041
01:12:02,067 --> 01:12:04,610
- On screen.
- Pilgrim, this is Houston.

1042
01:12:04,903 --> 01:12:07,447
Houston, the storms are here!
Wind speed at, uh...

1043
01:12:07,698 --> 01:12:10,366
- JULIE: Forty-five.
...45 miles per hour and rising!

1044
01:12:10,659 --> 01:12:13,202
- JULIE: <i>Visibility dropping.</i>
- FRED: <i>Houston, what should we do?</i>

1045
01:12:13,662 --> 01:12:15,204
FRED: Houston, please advise!

1046
01:12:15,456 --> 01:12:16,497
Paul?

1047
01:12:18,834 --> 01:12:21,377
Randall, no! That's...
that's impossible.

1048
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:23,421
PAUL: Our weather pattern analysis...

1049
01:12:23,589 --> 01:12:25,089
Mr. Wick, this is bad,
I don't think

1050
01:12:25,257 --> 01:12:27,008
I've ever seen anything
like this before.

1051
01:12:27,384 --> 01:12:29,093
It reminds me of a French Canadian...

1052
01:12:29,261 --> 01:12:31,429
Tennis racket stuck
to the back of a...

1053
01:12:31,513 --> 01:12:32,388
It's no good...

1054
01:12:32,473 --> 01:12:33,848
Bubbling out of my sister's...

1055
01:12:34,016 --> 01:12:35,141
Brazilian donkey!

1056
01:12:35,309 --> 01:12:37,310
I don't think
I can make myself any clearer!

1057
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:39,270
Wick, get 'em off that planet!

1058
01:12:41,106 --> 01:12:42,315
Do as he says, Paul.

1059
01:12:43,442 --> 01:12:45,276
Ben, we had no way of knowing.

1060
01:12:46,987 --> 01:12:48,946
I followed procedure, Ben.

1061
01:12:49,490 --> 01:12:51,115
PAUL: I followed procedure, here!

1062
01:12:51,533 --> 01:12:52,950
Paul, unplug and go home.

1063
01:12:53,952 --> 01:12:56,037
Unplug and go home?

1064
01:12:57,206 --> 01:12:58,331
Nesbitt, you're in command.

1065
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:02,293
FRED: <i>Houston, do you copy?</i>
<i>Houston, come in!</i>

1066
01:13:02,503 --> 01:13:04,629
MAN: Pilgrim we copy.
Please stand by.

1067
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:08,925
BUD: Don't stare at me, people!
We got a crew out there!

1068
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:10,635
Let's bring 'em home.

1069
01:13:26,568 --> 01:13:28,903
JULIE: Houston, wind speed continues
to increase.

1070
01:13:29,655 --> 01:13:32,824
- This is bad, Paul.
- Ford, it's Bud. Listen carefully.

1071
01:13:33,450 --> 01:13:36,994
If the wind keeps building at this rate,
in 20 minutes, liftoff will be impossible.

1072
01:13:38,205 --> 01:13:39,205
Launch now.

1073
01:13:39,498 --> 01:13:43,292
No! Commander Overbeck
and Ulysses are still out there!

1074
01:13:50,134 --> 01:13:52,260
They're lost now. You're not.

1075
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:55,054
Launch!

1076
01:13:55,472 --> 01:13:56,806
- I'm going after them.
- What?

1077
01:13:57,099 --> 01:14:00,059
BUD: Fred? Fred, answer me! Fred!

1078
01:14:00,227 --> 01:14:03,020
Can't hear you!
We're fading out fast!

1079
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:04,480
Fred!

1080
01:14:05,065 --> 01:14:08,109
If I'm not back in 20 minutes,
you've gotta take off without me!

1081
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:09,944
- BUD: Fred!
- JULIE: You will be back.

1082
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:12,738
- Twenty minutes and then take off!
- BUD: Fred!

1083
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:23,791
Twenty minutes, right?
Not 15 or anything?

1084
01:14:23,959 --> 01:14:24,876
All right.

1085
01:14:31,717 --> 01:14:33,050
Twenty-one is okay too.

1086
01:14:56,074 --> 01:14:56,991
Ford, what's going on?

1087
01:14:57,367 --> 01:14:59,368
BUD: What's happening?
I'm losing you! Julie!

1088
01:14:59,870 --> 01:15:01,787
FRED: Commander!

1089
01:15:02,831 --> 01:15:04,457
Commander Overbeck!

1090
01:15:06,752 --> 01:15:08,169

Ulysses!

1093
01:15:15,761 --> 01:15:18,971
Where are you? Answer me!

(HOOTING)

1095
01:15:22,434 --> 01:15:23,643
There you are!

1096
01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:25,895
How many times have I told you not

1097
01:15:26,063 --> 01:15:28,272
to wander around
in a Martian dust storm!

1098
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:30,107
We've got to find the commander.

FRED: Commander!

1102

FRED: Commander, is that you?

01:15:48,961 --> 01:15:51,212
- BILL: Randall!
- FRED: It is you!

1106
01:15:51,630 --> 01:15:55,550
FRED: All right, stand back,
little fella. Nothin' to see here.

1107
01:15:55,884 --> 01:15:57,885
- FRED: Commander!
- BILL: What are you doing here?

1108
01:15:58,053 --> 01:16:00,137
BILL: Get back to the ship
and save yourself!

1109
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:02,557
FRED: Sorry Commander,
I can't do that.

1110
01:16:02,766 --> 01:16:03,891
BILL: That's an order!

1111
01:16:04,268 --> 01:16:05,560
FRED: I've got to get you out.

1113
01:16:07,479 --> 01:16:08,604
FRED: I can't lift it.

1114

They say that when
a mother's child is trapped,

1115
01:16:11,483 --> 01:16:14,443
the rush of her adrenaline gives her
the strength of 20 men.

1116
01:16:14,945 --> 01:16:16,612
FRED: All right, Commander,
call me "Mommy"!

1117
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:20,157
- BILL: What?
- FRED: Call me "Mommy," now!

1118
01:16:21,076 --> 01:16:23,244
BILL: I'd rather die
in the Martian dirt!

1119
01:16:23,453 --> 01:16:26,122
- FRED: Who am I?
- BILL: Just lift the stinkin' thing!

1120
01:16:26,498 --> 01:16:27,582
FRED: Who am I?

1121
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:29,584
BILL: Mommy.

1122
01:16:30,168 --> 01:16:31,752
FRED: Say it like you love me.

1123
01:16:34,881 --> 01:16:38,801
BILL: Mommy.
Please, Mommy, save me.

1124
01:16:39,177 --> 01:16:42,346
- FRED: Mommy's coming, little Billy!
- BILL: Save me!

1125

FRED: Live, child! Live!

1126
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:51,397
You're alive, little Billy!

1127

BILL: Don't you ever call me
"Little Billy"!

1128
01:16:54,359 --> 01:16:56,402

to talk to your mother!

1130
01:16:59,281 --> 01:17:00,406
Julie, where's Fred?

1131
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:03,451
Still out there.
I'm initiating launch sequence.

1132
01:17:03,785 --> 01:17:05,119
Wait, they still have time
to get back!

1133
01:17:05,495 --> 01:17:06,579
Give 'em a chance!

1134
01:17:07,289 --> 01:17:08,456
I know what I'm doing.

1135
01:17:12,961 --> 01:17:14,337
FRED: Which way, Commander?

1136
01:17:14,546 --> 01:17:17,673
BILL: I don't know. Can't get a reading.
Let's get down behind that rock.

FRED: Come on, Ulysses.

1138
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:23,554
I'm gonna go out there
and take a closer look.

1139

It's the <i>Pilgrim!</i>

with the engines! Come on!

BILL: The tank's empty!

1145
01:17:41,823 --> 01:17:42,907
We'll share air.

1146
01:17:43,450 --> 01:17:45,493
BILL: We don't have a spare hose,
remember?

1147
01:17:46,244 --> 01:17:49,497
FRED: Well, then I'll give him mine.
You don't leave friends behind.

1148

BILL: What are you gonna do?
Hold your breath?

1149
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:53,042
You'll never make it to the Pilgrim!

1150
01:17:53,293 --> 01:17:54,627
FRED: Don't forget, Commander,

1151
01:17:54,836 --> 01:17:58,714
I'm the new NASA record holder
for lung capacity. (INHALES)

1152
01:17:59,174 --> 01:18:03,135
BILL: That was three minutes!
This is, what, four, maybe five?

1153
01:18:03,512 --> 01:18:05,137
FRED: What? You ignore me
the whole trip

1154
01:18:05,305 --> 01:18:07,723
and now that I have no air
you wanna chat?

1155
01:18:08,558 --> 01:18:09,600
BILL: Randall...

1156
01:18:11,478 --> 01:18:15,398
Randall? Randall! Randall!

JULIE: Oh, no, not now!

1158
01:18:28,328 --> 01:18:29,662
Twenty minutes are up, Julie.

1159
01:18:30,372 --> 01:18:32,039
Wait... I see someone!

1160
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:33,833
Ford, what's going on?

1161
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:37,336
- I got it!
- BUD: Ford, Who is it? Julie, do you copy?

1162
01:18:37,879 --> 01:18:38,754
Julie?

1163
01:18:39,005 --> 01:18:42,341
Fred, are you there? Fred?
Copy, somebody!

1164
01:18:42,968 --> 01:18:44,802
Bill! Where's Fred?

1165
01:18:45,345 --> 01:18:47,680
He should've been here.
Don't launch.

1166
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:50,683
JULIE: There he is!

1167
01:18:51,309 --> 01:18:53,686
Fred...
He's going the other way! Fred!

1168
01:18:54,020 --> 01:18:55,980
BOTH: Hey! Fred!

1169
01:19:06,992 --> 01:19:08,492
- Get me outta this!
- What are you doing?

1170
01:19:09,077 --> 01:19:10,161
It's empty anyway.

1171
01:19:12,330 --> 01:19:14,915
- He's holding his breath out there.
- Oh, my God!

1172
01:19:16,585 --> 01:19:18,294
If we're not back in five minutes...

1173
01:19:25,427 --> 01:19:26,886
Hurry! Hurry, Bill!

01:19:34,728 --> 01:19:37,313

Is he okay?

1175
01:19:37,522 --> 01:19:40,024
BILL: He's not breathing!
Get his helmet off!

1176
01:19:44,279 --> 01:19:45,821

01:20:12,808 --> 01:20:14,892
- BILL: We need go for launch.
- Get the hell out of there!

1185
01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:18,187
Roger that, Houston.
Preparing for launch.

1186
01:20:18,522 --> 01:20:20,105
Not the hairy one! Take me!

1187
01:20:20,482 --> 01:20:22,817
- Priming main thrusters.
- JULIE: Rocket boosters intact.

1188
01:20:22,984 --> 01:20:24,693
(SCREECHING AND JABBERING)

1189
01:20:24,945 --> 01:20:28,614
JULIE: Fred? Fred! Fred, he's fine!
He's just resting.

1190
01:20:29,616 --> 01:20:33,035
- In the next five, we're ready to go.
- Thrusters go in three, two...

1191
01:20:33,286 --> 01:20:34,495
- Hold on.
- BILL: one.

1192
01:20:39,084 --> 01:20:40,417
We have liftoff.

1193
01:20:40,627 --> 01:20:41,710
Fifty meters.

1194
01:20:42,379 --> 01:20:43,379
One hundred.

1195
01:20:44,047 --> 01:20:46,048
- MAN 1: Increasing velocity.
- MAN 2: Two hundred meters.

1196
01:20:48,385 --> 01:20:51,220
Course is good.
Nice flying, Uncle Walnut.

1197
01:20:51,429 --> 01:20:53,430
JULIE: One thousand.
Two thousand.

1198
01:20:54,391 --> 01:20:55,391
Increasing velocity.

1199
01:20:55,725 --> 01:20:58,269
MAN 2: Five thousand.
Six thousand...

1200
01:20:59,604 --> 01:21:01,188
- Eight thousand.
- Just a little higher.

1201
01:21:01,356 --> 01:21:02,940
You're almost clear of the storm.

1202
01:21:03,191 --> 01:21:04,275
JULIE: Ten thousand.

1203
01:21:07,028 --> 01:21:09,572
- JULIE: All systems green.
- I think we made it.

1204
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:18,122
What the hell was that?

1205
01:21:19,791 --> 01:21:22,877
- Houston, we've had an impact!
- It wasn't me!

1206
01:21:24,087 --> 01:21:25,671
BILL: Navigation controls
are compromised!

1207
01:21:25,839 --> 01:21:28,674
JULIE: Switching to auxiliary power.
We're losing velocity!

1208
01:21:28,967 --> 01:21:29,967
Status!

1209
01:21:30,176 --> 01:21:32,136
ECLSS down, OMS down,
visual contact down.

1210
01:21:32,429 --> 01:21:34,471
- They got a total kill here.
- Solutions!

1211
01:21:34,848 --> 01:21:37,057
Randall rewires
the entire operation system circuitry

1212
01:21:37,267 --> 01:21:38,684
in less than two minutes.
End of solutions.

1213
01:21:38,935 --> 01:21:40,102
Bud, what do we do here?

1214
01:21:40,979 --> 01:21:41,979
We do nothing.

1215
01:21:42,689 --> 01:21:44,189
MAN 2: Pilgrim is in a freefall.

1216
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:50,446
Nav controls are out. Randall,
I need the engine computers up now!

1217
01:21:51,281 --> 01:21:53,365
This time it was definitely not me!

1218
01:21:54,576 --> 01:21:57,244
BILL: I'm switching to manual.
Randall, check below.

1219
01:22:00,749 --> 01:22:02,917
Randall, how's it look down there?

1220
01:22:03,251 --> 01:22:06,045
Like this!
(MIMICS ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)

1221
01:22:06,755 --> 01:22:07,755
BILL: Well, fix it!

1222
01:22:07,964 --> 01:22:10,633
Will you stop this ship from tumbling
and give me about a week?

1223
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:12,760
I can't stop the tumbling
and you've got two minutes!

1224
01:22:15,931 --> 01:22:20,476
To recap the story, the Pilgrim
was caught in a violent sandstorm

1225
01:22:20,810 --> 01:22:23,520
and is now tumbling towards
the Martian surface.

1226
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:27,441
We're standing by to hear what
the latest NASA has to say

1227
01:22:27,609 --> 01:22:28,859
about this terrible incident.

1228
01:22:30,862 --> 01:22:32,988
MAN: Forty-five hundred meters,
dropping fast.

1229
01:22:33,448 --> 01:22:34,657
Ninety seconds to impact.

1230
01:22:35,742 --> 01:22:37,576
Can you tell me straight, Nesbit,
can he do it?

1231
01:22:37,994 --> 01:22:41,246
Only a complete genius
or a total fool could pull this off.

1232
01:22:42,332 --> 01:22:43,791
Lucky for us he's both.

1233
01:22:50,465 --> 01:22:51,590
Any power yet, Bill?

1234
01:22:51,841 --> 01:22:53,801
I got nothing.
We're in a flat spin.

1235
01:23:00,558 --> 01:23:03,227
Randall, this would be
a terrific time to fix that!

1236
01:23:03,770 --> 01:23:05,187
BILL: Any time now would be good!

1237
01:23:07,232 --> 01:23:09,066
60 seconds to impact.
System's still red.

1238
01:23:09,275 --> 01:23:10,401
We've established audio link.

1239
01:23:11,277 --> 01:23:13,112
Fred?
Fred, can you hear me?

1240
01:23:13,822 --> 01:23:17,241
Bud... I'm down below.
Everything's spinning.

1241
01:23:17,617 --> 01:23:20,160
- I don't know what to do!
- Focus, Fred.

1242
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:23,831
It's like in training.
The rotating chair with the wires.

1243
01:23:24,332 --> 01:23:26,750
- That was a real winner!
- BUD: You can do this.

1244
01:23:27,210 --> 01:23:28,585
Trust your instincts.

1245
01:23:33,133 --> 01:23:34,216
Now!

1246
01:23:38,888 --> 01:23:41,015
FRED: Fred, come on! You can do it.

1247
01:23:41,307 --> 01:23:43,684
Thirty seconds!
Don't give up, Fred!

1248
01:23:43,893 --> 01:23:44,977
Come on, Fred!

1249
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:51,442
FRED: Gotta close the circuit.

1250
01:23:57,157 --> 01:23:59,491
- Come on, Fred.
- Fifteen seconds to impact.

1251
01:24:00,076 --> 01:24:01,660
Need something decent.

1252
01:24:02,245 --> 01:24:03,620
You're the man, Fred!

1253
01:24:04,789 --> 01:24:06,623
- Come on.
- JULIE: Ten seconds!

1254
01:24:08,793 --> 01:24:10,669
- Bud's coin!
- Come on!

1255
01:24:14,758 --> 01:24:17,217
FRED: Yee-haa!

1256
01:24:18,011 --> 01:24:19,553
I got power!

1257
01:24:23,808 --> 01:24:25,184
You did it, Fred!

1258
01:24:26,019 --> 01:24:28,896
BILL: Yes! Yes! Yes!

1259
01:24:32,317 --> 01:24:35,611
Put on the porch light, Mama!
We're comin' home!

1260
01:24:50,794 --> 01:24:55,089
Oh, Magoo.
You've done it again, sir!

1261
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:12,606
That little space rock's gonna make you
real famous, Julie Ford.

1262
01:25:14,067 --> 01:25:16,401
So, what's next for you, rocketman?

1263
01:25:16,694 --> 01:25:21,740
Well, actually, I was thinking
about asking you to dance.

1264
01:25:22,075 --> 01:25:23,033
(LAUGHING)

1265
01:25:23,326 --> 01:25:26,912
Oh, well. Thanks anyway but I think
we've done that before.

1266
01:25:27,747 --> 01:25:31,125
Wait a second, I had a little time
on my hands recently,

1267
01:25:31,292 --> 01:25:32,501
and I've been practicing.

1268
01:25:32,669 --> 01:25:36,547
That and I got a little bit creative
with the space blankets.

1269
01:26:03,032 --> 01:26:07,536
(SINGING) When you wish upon a star

1270
01:26:07,871 --> 01:26:11,915
Makes no difference who you are

1271
01:26:12,625 --> 01:26:16,628
Anything your heart desires

1272
01:26:16,921 --> 01:26:21,175
Will come to you

1273
01:26:26,681 --> 01:26:32,144
Like a bolt out of the blue

1274
01:26:32,312 --> 01:26:34,646
Fate steps in

1275
01:26:34,898 --> 01:26:39,526
And sees you through

1276
01:26:39,944 --> 01:26:42,487
When you wish

1277
01:26:42,864 --> 01:26:45,866
Upon a star

1278
01:26:46,659 --> 01:26:49,703
Your dreams

1279
01:26:50,038 --> 01:26:52,623
Come

1280
01:26:52,957 --> 01:26:55,375
True

1281
01:26:59,589 --> 01:27:01,256
Sweet dreams, lovebirds.

1282
01:27:02,592 --> 01:27:05,135
So, I guess I'll see you
in eight months.

1283
01:27:06,429 --> 01:27:07,512
JULIE: Goodnight, Fred.

1284
01:27:23,112 --> 01:27:25,155
It's a tale as old as time, Ulysses.

1285
01:27:25,907 --> 01:27:27,282
Boy meets girl.

1286
01:27:28,952 --> 01:27:30,327
Boy falls for girl.

1287
01:27:30,870 --> 01:27:32,996
Boy and girl return to home planet,

1288
01:27:33,248 --> 01:27:35,874
get a nice little house
with a white picket fence

1289
01:27:36,084 --> 01:27:37,125
and live happily...

1290
01:27:37,502 --> 01:27:38,418
No!

1291
01:27:39,045 --> 01:27:43,715
No, not again! Ulysses! No!

1292
01:27:45,551 --> 01:27:51,181
