2
00:02:41,693 --> 00:02:43,159
- rudi!

3
00:02:44,362 --> 00:02:46,895
Dreaming again?

4
00:02:48,698 --> 00:02:51,231
That's four plates,
three cups, and a platter

5
00:02:51,233 --> 00:02:52,632
so far this week.

6
00:02:52,634 --> 00:02:55,434
You're breaking
your own record, boy.

7
00:02:55,436 --> 00:02:56,568
If it didn't make it too dark,

8
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:58,570
I'd put a blind up
over that window.

9
00:02:58,572 --> 00:03:00,538
And hurry up over those dishes,

10
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,573
or the water will be cold

11
00:03:02,575 --> 00:03:04,374
and the dishes covered
in grease.

12
00:03:04,376 --> 00:03:06,709
Every day, it's the same thing.

13
00:03:06,711 --> 00:03:10,379
Never any time
to do anything properly.

14
00:03:10,381 --> 00:03:13,348
This is your job, you know.
You should be doing this.

15
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,950
Oh, no.

16
00:03:14,951 --> 00:03:16,552
You'll have me doing
the washing up next.

17
00:03:16,553 --> 00:03:18,419
Almost time
for the tourists to be back

18
00:03:18,421 --> 00:03:19,686
from their morning climb...

19
00:03:19,688 --> 00:03:22,422
hungry as wolves
and harder to please.

20
00:03:22,424 --> 00:03:24,824
If only their climbing were
as good as their appetites.

21
00:03:24,826 --> 00:03:27,693
The citadel would have been
climbed a hundred times by now.

22
00:03:27,695 --> 00:03:30,295
No, all they do
is to come out here to eat.

23
00:03:30,297 --> 00:03:32,563
I wonder if they're as
particular when they're at home.

24
00:03:32,565 --> 00:03:35,232
This one wants no garlic
in his rice.

25
00:03:35,234 --> 00:03:36,566
This one wants something else.

26
00:03:36,568 --> 00:03:39,569
The rest of them want
whatever we haven't got.

27
00:03:39,571 --> 00:03:42,572
Rudi, you'll have to go
and get me a bag of carrots.

28
00:03:42,574 --> 00:03:45,708
Hmm?
Where is he?

29
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:46,842
Rudi!

30
00:03:46,844 --> 00:03:50,579
- Mmm, something smells good.

31
00:03:50,581 --> 00:03:51,947
- Something smells.

32
00:03:56,219 --> 00:03:58,285
- Where is he?

33
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:03,222
- He's just passing
frau getz's back garden.

34
00:04:08,528 --> 00:04:12,296
That dog always barks at rudi.

35
00:04:12,298 --> 00:04:14,431
I felt he'd go today.

36
00:04:14,433 --> 00:04:16,566
I felt it from the moment
I woke up this morning.

37
00:04:16,568 --> 00:04:19,302
- Then why didn't you stop him?
- Stop him?

38
00:04:19,304 --> 00:04:21,437
Oh, teo.

39
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:23,572
Would you try
and bottle up the wind?

40
00:04:23,574 --> 00:04:25,707
- Now, what kind
of crazy talk is that?

41
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:27,442
Is that what
I'm to tell your father

42
00:04:27,444 --> 00:04:29,844
when he finds out
the boy's gone again?

43
00:04:29,846 --> 00:04:31,312
- No.

44
00:04:31,314 --> 00:04:32,980
But you'll think of something.

45
00:04:32,982 --> 00:04:34,815
- Yes, the truth.

46
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:38,285
You wait.
This time you'll see.

47
00:04:38,287 --> 00:04:39,686
Bottle the wind...

48
00:04:39,688 --> 00:04:42,622
I'll bottle the wind for him.

49
00:04:44,292 --> 00:04:46,959
- I thought so.
I saw him from the window.

50
00:04:46,961 --> 00:04:48,627
- Well, what if you did?
The boy's gone home.

51
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:50,562
His mother's sick.
- Well, don't bite my head off.

52
00:04:50,564 --> 00:04:52,064
I only...

53
00:04:52,065 --> 00:04:53,565
- are the tables set,
the sugar bowls filled?

54
00:04:53,567 --> 00:04:54,766
You have time to waste?
- Well, I...

55
00:04:55,769 --> 00:04:56,768
Ooh!

56
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,903
- Oh, teo, practice shows.

57
00:04:58,905 --> 00:05:02,373
You're such a beautiful liar.

58
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:04,708
Now, I would've stammered
and stuttered.

59
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,343
- I was saving me own skin.

60
00:05:06,344 --> 00:05:07,977
I'm supposed to be in charge
of the young rascal.

61
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:11,847
Now, leave me alone.
I've got work to do.

62
00:05:11,849 --> 00:05:13,849
- He must be almost
at the high meadow by now.

63
00:05:13,851 --> 00:05:15,817
- Will you kindly go
someplace else?

64
00:05:15,819 --> 00:05:17,685
It isn't fitting
for the proprietor's daughter

65
00:05:17,687 --> 00:05:21,689
always to be hanging
around the kitchen.

66
00:05:21,691 --> 00:05:24,125
- Oh, do you remember, teo,

67
00:05:24,126 --> 00:05:26,560
when the three of us would go
to the felsberg on your day off?

68
00:05:26,562 --> 00:05:29,829
We'd take lunches,
and you'd teach rudi.

69
00:05:29,831 --> 00:05:32,198
- Yes.

70
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:34,566
Well, those days are over
and finished.

71
00:05:34,569 --> 00:05:37,836
I promised never to mention
the mountains to rudi again,

72
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,504
and I'm a man of my word.

73
00:07:35,449 --> 00:07:38,616
Monte d'oro...

74
00:07:38,618 --> 00:07:42,953
Windowen...

75
00:07:42,955 --> 00:07:45,655
And you.

76
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:51,459
And you!

77
00:07:51,461 --> 00:07:53,827
Hello!

78
00:07:57,499 --> 00:07:59,866
And you!

79
00:07:59,868 --> 00:08:02,001
Hello!

80
00:08:04,905 --> 00:08:07,004
Hello!

81
00:08:09,975 --> 00:08:12,175
Hello!

82
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:19,981
Help!

83
00:08:22,618 --> 00:08:25,051
- Hello!

84
00:08:32,527 --> 00:08:35,127
Hello!

85
00:08:47,006 --> 00:08:49,473
Help!

86
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:06,589
- Hello!

87
00:09:09,026 --> 00:09:10,558
- Hello!

88
00:09:14,063 --> 00:09:16,563
- Hello!

89
00:09:22,536 --> 00:09:25,136
- Hold on.
I'll get you out!

90
00:09:44,924 --> 00:09:46,790
- Is that all the rope
you've got?

91
00:09:46,792 --> 00:09:49,526
- Yes, but I'll think
of something.

92
00:10:25,263 --> 00:10:26,328
Right!

93
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:26,385
Keep moving.
You must keep moving.

94
00:11:26,387 --> 00:11:29,354
Get on your feet.

95
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:31,622
- I'll be all right.

96
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:34,624
Just let me get my breath.

97
00:11:36,361 --> 00:11:39,328
Why, you're only a boy.

98
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:40,713
- Don't try to talk, sir.

99
00:11:40,714 --> 00:11:42,097
- How did you get up here
at all?

100
00:11:42,099 --> 00:11:43,798
- I come up here all the time.

101
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,401
It's nothing.

102
00:11:46,402 --> 00:11:49,003
- Nothing?
You only saved my life.

103
00:11:53,975 --> 00:11:56,308
- It must be a mistake.

104
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:57,776
- Why?

105
00:11:57,778 --> 00:11:59,210
- I couldn't have saved
your life.

106
00:11:59,212 --> 00:12:00,711
You're captain winter.

107
00:12:00,713 --> 00:12:02,345
- That's right.

108
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:04,080
There's no mistake.

109
00:12:04,081 --> 00:12:05,814
- But how could you have fallen
down a crevasse?

110
00:12:05,817 --> 00:12:08,050
- Because I was too busy
looking up at a Mountain

111
00:12:08,052 --> 00:12:10,685
to see what was at my own feet.

112
00:12:10,687 --> 00:12:12,186
- That Mountain?

113
00:12:12,188 --> 00:12:17,024
- Yes, that Mountain.

114
00:12:25,334 --> 00:12:28,702
Tell me, why are you
so interested in that Mountain?

115
00:12:28,704 --> 00:12:30,970
- My father was killed on it.

116
00:12:30,972 --> 00:12:33,038
- Your father?

117
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,339
What's your name?

118
00:12:34,341 --> 00:12:36,374
- Rudi Matt.

119
00:12:36,376 --> 00:12:38,342
- The son of Josef Matt.

120
00:12:38,344 --> 00:12:39,943
- Yes, sir.

121
00:12:39,945 --> 00:12:41,678
- I might have known.

122
00:12:52,089 --> 00:12:53,788
What do you think, rudi?

123
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,122
Can it be climbed?

124
00:12:55,124 --> 00:12:56,289
- The citadel?

125
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:58,724
- Your father thought so.

126
00:12:58,726 --> 00:13:00,258
Of all the guides
in Switzerland,

127
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,726
he was the only one
who thought so.

128
00:13:01,728 --> 00:13:04,328
So do I.

129
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,996
- Is that why you're in kurtal?

130
00:13:05,998 --> 00:13:07,464
You're going to try to climb
the citadel?

131
00:13:07,466 --> 00:13:09,265
- It's not as simple as that.

132
00:13:09,267 --> 00:13:13,936
There isn't a guide in the whole
of kurtal who would go with me.

133
00:13:13,938 --> 00:13:15,938
- Well, have you talked
to my Uncle, Franz lerner?

134
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,073
I've spoken to him about it.

135
00:13:18,075 --> 00:13:19,340
He wants no part of it.

136
00:13:19,342 --> 00:13:21,809
Any other peak,
any other venture,

137
00:13:21,811 --> 00:13:23,443
but not the citadel.

138
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:33,251
Perhaps I'll go over to the next
valley, over to broli.

139
00:13:33,253 --> 00:13:35,186
There's a guide there
named saxo.

140
00:13:35,188 --> 00:13:36,353
He claims...
- Emil saxo?

141
00:13:36,355 --> 00:13:37,954
- Yes.

142
00:13:37,956 --> 00:13:41,257
But first I mean to reconnoiter
some more, pick a route.

143
00:13:41,259 --> 00:13:43,192
If there is a route.

144
00:13:43,194 --> 00:13:45,894
- There is a route.

145
00:13:45,896 --> 00:13:49,030
- What makes you think so?
No one else does.

146
00:13:49,032 --> 00:13:50,431
- Because I want to.

147
00:13:50,433 --> 00:13:52,833
I believe the story
old teo tells.

148
00:13:52,835 --> 00:13:54,501
- Old teo?

149
00:13:54,503 --> 00:13:56,269
- The other guide
who was with my father.

150
00:13:56,271 --> 00:13:57,336
- What does old teo say?

151
00:13:57,338 --> 00:13:59,371
- On that last day,

152
00:13:59,373 --> 00:14:01,840
sir Edward and teo
waited on a ledge

153
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:05,743
while my father
went on by himself.

154
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:07,412
And when he came back,

155
00:14:07,414 --> 00:14:13,017
there was a strange,
excited look on his face.

156
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:17,420
But before he could tell them
what he'd found,

157
00:14:17,422 --> 00:14:19,955
the avalanche came and swept
them down the Mountain.

158
00:14:19,957 --> 00:14:21,924
Sir Edward was badly injured,

159
00:14:21,925 --> 00:14:23,892
and my father stayed with him
while teo went for help.

160
00:14:23,894 --> 00:14:25,894
- I know the rest, rudi.

161
00:14:25,896 --> 00:14:28,396
When they found them, your
father had taken off his jacket

162
00:14:28,398 --> 00:14:30,164
and his sweater and wrapped them
around sir Edward.

163
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:33,000
- And at the last,
his shirt, sir.

164
00:14:33,002 --> 00:14:35,102
He covered him
with his red shirt.

165
00:14:36,538 --> 00:14:39,505
- I'd like to have known him,
rudi.

166
00:14:47,646 --> 00:14:49,612
- Good evening, ladies.
- Good evening, herr hempel.

167
00:14:49,614 --> 00:14:51,180
- Have you had a good time,
gentlemen?

168
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:53,081
- Very exciting.
- Magnificent view.

169
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,348
- Gives you a wonderful
appetite.

170
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:56,917
- A fine dinner awaits you.
- Thank you.

171
00:14:58,186 --> 00:15:00,019
Americans, lizbeth.

172
00:15:00,021 --> 00:15:02,421
The world is coming
to my hotel.

173
00:15:02,423 --> 00:15:05,657
Oh, I mistook them for English.

174
00:15:05,659 --> 00:15:09,460
They would happily have paid
20 francs instead of 10.

175
00:15:13,899 --> 00:15:16,499
- Now, can you assure us that
we have everything we need?

176
00:15:16,501 --> 00:15:18,701
- Oh, yes, ma'am.

177
00:15:18,702 --> 00:15:20,902
But, uh, perhaps you could
use a good Porter?

178
00:15:20,905 --> 00:15:24,172
- Well, then, meet us
at the hotel at 10:30.

179
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:26,340
- Certainly, ma'am.

180
00:15:27,976 --> 00:15:30,209
Certainly, ma'am.

181
00:15:43,555 --> 00:15:45,555
Who you looking for?

182
00:15:45,557 --> 00:15:47,290
I'm back.
- Were you away?

183
00:15:47,292 --> 00:15:50,426
- Say, choral group tonight.
I'd be pleased to take you.

184
00:15:50,428 --> 00:15:52,694
- But thank you.

185
00:15:52,696 --> 00:15:55,329
- You'd be better off with me
than that plate-scraper.

186
00:15:55,331 --> 00:15:58,432
- Oh, you worry about me
too much, Klaus.

187
00:15:58,434 --> 00:16:04,604
Rudi hasn't invited me yet,
but if he should...

188
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:08,974
- Hey, wai...!

189
00:16:08,976 --> 00:16:11,309
Good evening, herr lerner.

190
00:16:11,311 --> 00:16:13,511
I hear the great captain
winter's in kurtal,

191
00:16:13,513 --> 00:16:16,046
asking questions
about the citadel.

192
00:16:16,048 --> 00:16:17,714
- Every man has his weakness.

193
00:16:17,716 --> 00:16:19,182
- Yes, and it's usually
in his head.

194
00:16:30,494 --> 00:16:32,293
- Franz is coming this way.

195
00:16:32,295 --> 00:16:34,128
What are you going to tell him?

196
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:37,130
- Well, you need practice.
You tell him something.

197
00:16:39,467 --> 00:16:40,466
- Evening, lizbeth.

198
00:16:40,468 --> 00:16:41,667
- Evening, herr lerner.

199
00:16:41,669 --> 00:16:43,168
- Teo.

200
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,702
Where's the boy?

201
00:16:44,704 --> 00:16:45,703
Evening, Gretchen.

202
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:48,305
- You mean rudi?
- Who else?

203
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:50,573
- Well, as you can see,
he isn't here.

204
00:16:50,575 --> 00:16:54,043
I sent him on an errand.
- Ah.

205
00:16:54,045 --> 00:16:55,177
Everything all right, then?

206
00:16:55,179 --> 00:16:56,444
Behaving himself?

207
00:16:56,446 --> 00:16:58,012
- Oh, well enough.

208
00:16:58,014 --> 00:17:00,647
- I just thought I'd drop in.

209
00:17:02,517 --> 00:17:04,550
- Herr lerner.
- Mm-hmm?

210
00:17:04,552 --> 00:17:08,519
- Will you tell your sister
I'm sorry she's sick?

211
00:17:09,655 --> 00:17:12,022
- Who said my sister was sick?

212
00:17:12,024 --> 00:17:15,492
- Didn't you say, sir?
Isn't that why rudi got...

213
00:17:15,494 --> 00:17:18,361
- ah, you interfering,
little...

214
00:17:18,363 --> 00:17:20,429
- so! It's that again!

215
00:17:20,431 --> 00:17:24,332
And you, teo, encouraging
and defending him!

216
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:26,000
One lie piled
on top of another!

217
00:17:26,002 --> 00:17:27,401
- I always lie to nosy women.

218
00:17:27,403 --> 00:17:28,886
- You lied to me!

219
00:17:28,887 --> 00:17:30,370
- Well, who are you to expect
special privileges?

220
00:17:30,372 --> 00:17:32,539
- Oh, teo.

221
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,707
Herr lerner, so much bother
about a few unwashed dishes.

222
00:17:34,709 --> 00:17:36,442
- It isn't a question
of how many dishes.

223
00:17:36,444 --> 00:17:38,577
It's a question of principle.
This is where the boy works!

224
00:17:38,579 --> 00:17:40,178
- Why do you always call him
"the boy,"

225
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,079
as if he were a...
a piece of furniture

226
00:17:42,081 --> 00:17:43,713
that you could put down here,
and here he would stay?

227
00:17:43,715 --> 00:17:46,148
- Because he is a boy,
and this is where he belongs!

228
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,416
- Because you say so?

229
00:17:47,417 --> 00:17:48,683
- I thought you agreed
to keep out of this.

230
00:17:48,685 --> 00:17:51,619
- I have, and I intend to.

231
00:17:51,621 --> 00:17:53,721
But it'll all be the same
in the end.

232
00:17:53,723 --> 00:17:56,290
It isn't in the Matt blood
to be locked up in a kitchen.

233
00:17:56,292 --> 00:17:58,692
And one day, that blood's
going to boil up

234
00:17:58,694 --> 00:18:00,226
and you won't be able
to stop it

235
00:18:00,228 --> 00:18:02,695
any more than you can...
how did you say it?

236
00:18:02,697 --> 00:18:05,097
- Any more than you can
bottle up the wind.

237
00:18:05,099 --> 00:18:07,299
- Bottle up the wind?
What do you mean?

238
00:18:07,301 --> 00:18:09,234
There's something going on here
behind my back!

239
00:18:09,236 --> 00:18:10,568
- Now stop roaring!

240
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:11,669
Do you want herr hempel

241
00:18:11,671 --> 00:18:14,571
to think I'm stewing a live bull
in here?

242
00:18:22,646 --> 00:18:24,579
- Tell me, what are you
in the village, rudi?

243
00:18:24,581 --> 00:18:26,280
An apprentice guide?

244
00:18:26,282 --> 00:18:27,281
- No, sir.

245
00:18:27,283 --> 00:18:28,715
- What then?

246
00:18:28,717 --> 00:18:31,084
- I'm a dishwasher.

247
00:18:31,086 --> 00:18:34,454
- The son of Josef Matt?

248
00:18:45,699 --> 00:18:47,832
- I'd take the path, sir.

249
00:18:47,834 --> 00:18:51,368
But first,
I must ask you a favor.

250
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:53,403
Will you not tell anyone
you saw me on the Mountain?

251
00:18:53,405 --> 00:18:56,239
- Not tell anyone?
After what happened today?

252
00:18:56,241 --> 00:18:57,573
Why, you're too modest, rudi.

253
00:18:57,575 --> 00:18:59,741
- Well, please, sir.

254
00:18:59,743 --> 00:19:02,176
If my mother and Uncle knew,
I would be in great trouble.

255
00:19:02,178 --> 00:19:04,144
- All right, I'll see you don't
get into trouble.

256
00:19:04,146 --> 00:19:06,513
- Thank you.

257
00:19:11,652 --> 00:19:15,553
- You know, Franz, perhaps
if you spoke to herr hempel,

258
00:19:15,555 --> 00:19:18,255
rudi could work in another part
of the hotel,

259
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:19,589
away from old teo.

260
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:21,357
- What's the good?

261
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:22,758
There'd still be lizbeth.

262
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,361
- Hmm. It's been on my mind
to speak to lizbeth.

263
00:19:26,363 --> 00:19:28,629
- And risk offending
herr hempel?

264
00:19:28,631 --> 00:19:34,434
No, ilse.
Leave her out of it.

265
00:19:34,436 --> 00:19:36,669
Summer will come.

266
00:19:36,671 --> 00:19:39,838
The boy will go to Zurich for
his training in the business,

267
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,573
and there he'll learn

268
00:19:41,575 --> 00:19:43,808
there's another world
beyond the mountains,

269
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:46,710
forget this stubborn dream
of being a guide.

270
00:19:46,712 --> 00:19:50,246
- It's like a disease, a curse,

271
00:19:50,248 --> 00:19:53,749
as if that wicked Mountain
wanted him too.

272
00:19:53,751 --> 00:19:56,518
- Stop thinking like that,
ilse.

273
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,419
It'll all work out.

274
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:04,891
Let me handle him.

275
00:20:09,396 --> 00:20:12,130
- I guess I'm late.

276
00:20:12,132 --> 00:20:15,800
It was very busy
at the hotel today.

277
00:20:15,802 --> 00:20:17,668
There were a lot of dishes.

278
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:22,606
- Yes. I saw them.

279
00:20:24,576 --> 00:20:26,475
I also listened
to a lot of lies.

280
00:20:26,477 --> 00:20:27,776
Enough for one day.

281
00:20:27,778 --> 00:20:29,444
I don't want to hear any more.

282
00:20:29,446 --> 00:20:32,146
- After giving your word, rudi.

283
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:34,581
Why?

284
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:38,217
- I don't know.

285
00:20:38,219 --> 00:20:40,719
- You don't know?

286
00:20:40,721 --> 00:20:42,654
- I mean, I didn't
plan it that way.

287
00:20:42,656 --> 00:20:46,424
But from the kitchen, I could
see the sun on the mountains.

288
00:20:46,426 --> 00:20:48,325
- The sun on the mountains?

289
00:20:48,327 --> 00:20:51,261
- But not the bright future
you can have with herr hempel?

290
00:20:51,263 --> 00:20:53,413
He's so interested in you.

291
00:20:53,414 --> 00:20:55,564
- But I didn't ask herr hempel
to be interested in me.

292
00:20:55,567 --> 00:20:58,668
- No, it was handed to you
on a silver platter.

293
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:02,171
And not because of you,
but because of who you are.

294
00:21:02,173 --> 00:21:05,307
Your father brought tourists
to kurtal,

295
00:21:05,309 --> 00:21:06,908
climbers from all over
the world.

296
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,709
To him,
herr hempel owes his hotel.

297
00:21:08,711 --> 00:21:11,061
- Don't you see, rudi?

298
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:13,412
You have a chance to go farther
than any boy in the village.

299
00:21:13,415 --> 00:21:15,548
Someday you might even
be the proprietor

300
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:17,383
of the monte d'oro hotel.

301
00:21:17,384 --> 00:21:19,217
Can't you see how much better
your life will be

302
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:22,287
than climbing around
on rocks and ice?

303
00:21:22,289 --> 00:21:23,955
- No.

304
00:21:23,957 --> 00:21:25,656
- Now look at me, rudi.

305
00:21:25,658 --> 00:21:27,691
For 20 years,
I've been a guide.

306
00:21:27,693 --> 00:21:29,559
One of the best.

307
00:21:29,561 --> 00:21:31,827
Where has it gotten me?

308
00:21:31,829 --> 00:21:36,198
I haven't saved enough money
to buy a dozen cows.

309
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,833
And look what being a guide
did for old teo.

310
00:21:38,835 --> 00:21:41,769
Crippled.
Touched in the head.

311
00:21:41,771 --> 00:21:44,571
- No matter what you say,
he still climbed higher

312
00:21:44,573 --> 00:21:46,306
than any other man in kurtal.

313
00:21:46,308 --> 00:21:48,607
He's the only man alive who...
- Rudi.

314
00:21:50,877 --> 00:21:52,610
- That's right.

315
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:54,344
Stop and think for a moment
of somebody else.

316
00:21:54,347 --> 00:21:56,213
You can make up to your mother

317
00:21:56,215 --> 00:21:57,715
for a little
of what she's suffered.

318
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:01,584
- Where are you going, rudi?

319
00:22:01,586 --> 00:22:04,019
- Back to the hotel
to finish the dishes.

320
00:22:07,757 --> 00:22:10,057
- Captain winter!
- My apologies, friends.

321
00:22:10,059 --> 00:22:11,992
I looked for you in the village.
They told me I'd find you here.

322
00:22:11,994 --> 00:22:13,093
- Apologies, captain?

323
00:22:13,095 --> 00:22:15,562
It's an honor
for me and my sister.

324
00:22:15,564 --> 00:22:18,064
- The honor is mine, to meet
the widow of Josef Matt.

325
00:22:18,066 --> 00:22:20,766
- And this is her son, rudi.
- Hello.

326
00:22:20,768 --> 00:22:22,400
- Won't you be seated, captain?

327
00:22:22,402 --> 00:22:23,934
- I won't take up your time,
Franz.

328
00:22:23,936 --> 00:22:25,869
I just wanted to see
if you'd be available

329
00:22:25,871 --> 00:22:26,936
for a climb in the morning.

330
00:22:26,938 --> 00:22:28,470
- Of course.

331
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,104
That is, if you don't mean...

332
00:22:30,106 --> 00:22:32,372
No.
No, not the citadel.

333
00:22:32,374 --> 00:22:33,506
I was thinking
of the wunderhorn.

334
00:22:33,508 --> 00:22:34,673
I hear it's a good climb.

335
00:22:34,675 --> 00:22:36,508
- That's true,
and it's a fine view.

336
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:38,109
- Ah, it's the view
that interests me.

337
00:22:38,111 --> 00:22:39,677
I thought we'd leave about noon

338
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:41,111
and spend the night
at the blosse hut

339
00:22:41,113 --> 00:22:42,562
and go up the next morning.

340
00:22:42,563 --> 00:22:44,012
- Hmm. That would mean food
and blankets

341
00:22:44,015 --> 00:22:45,447
and probably a Porter.

342
00:22:45,449 --> 00:22:48,450
- By all means, a Porter.

343
00:22:48,452 --> 00:22:50,718
What about rudi here?

344
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,688
- Well, the boy works elsewhere,
but I'll find a good man.

345
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:56,723
- Please, Uncle.
Just this once?

346
00:22:56,725 --> 00:22:58,391
- Have you forgotten already?

347
00:22:58,393 --> 00:23:00,526
- But this is different,
to go with captain winter!

348
00:23:00,528 --> 00:23:01,727
- Enough!

349
00:23:01,729 --> 00:23:03,462
- Rudi,
what foolishness is this?

350
00:23:03,464 --> 00:23:05,931
- Even if I said yes,
you couldn't do it.

351
00:23:05,933 --> 00:23:09,701
- But I could.
Captain winter knows I could.

352
00:23:09,703 --> 00:23:11,035
That's why he asked for me.

353
00:23:11,037 --> 00:23:13,937
- When did captain winter
set eyes on you before?

354
00:23:15,473 --> 00:23:19,441
- It seems our secret
is out, rudi.

355
00:23:19,443 --> 00:23:21,509
Rudi and I met on the glacier
this afternoon.

356
00:23:21,511 --> 00:23:23,043
- And he told you
he was a Porter?

357
00:23:23,045 --> 00:23:24,577
- No, no.

358
00:23:24,579 --> 00:23:26,378
But it's my pleasure
to tell you

359
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,712
that on the glacier
this afternoon,

360
00:23:27,714 --> 00:23:30,448
this boy saved my life.

361
00:23:41,792 --> 00:23:44,125
- Woof, woof, woof yourself.

362
00:23:56,171 --> 00:23:56,671
¶ ¶

363
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:04,909
- What's the matter with you?

364
00:24:04,911 --> 00:24:07,044
Have you lost
what little mind you had?

365
00:24:07,046 --> 00:24:09,646
- Yes! I mean, no.
Now, wait till you hear.

366
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:11,748
Tomorrow, I go
to the wunderhorn.

367
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,649
- Rudi!
- He must have hit his head.

368
00:24:13,651 --> 00:24:15,951
- As Porter to the great
captain winter.

369
00:24:15,953 --> 00:24:17,052
- He has hit his head.

370
00:24:17,054 --> 00:24:18,620
- I told you
they couldn't stop him!

371
00:24:18,622 --> 00:24:20,154
He's running away again!
- Not this time.

372
00:24:20,156 --> 00:24:21,889
My mother and Uncle have
given me their permission.

373
00:24:21,891 --> 00:24:23,156
I've talked to Tony fasler,

374
00:24:23,158 --> 00:24:24,590
and he's going to do
the dishes for me.

375
00:24:24,592 --> 00:24:26,491
- So they've finally given in.

376
00:24:26,493 --> 00:24:28,159
He's going to be a guide
after all.

377
00:24:28,161 --> 00:24:29,493
- Well, just for tomorrow,

378
00:24:29,495 --> 00:24:32,062
and only because
of captain winter.

379
00:24:32,064 --> 00:24:35,598
But it'd be worth it if it was
the last day of my life.

380
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,933
- May very well be.
Now, you calm down.

381
00:24:37,935 --> 00:24:41,036
Remember, you've never climbed
with a party before.

382
00:24:41,038 --> 00:24:43,171
- Who was it who used to go to
the practice Mountain with us?

383
00:24:43,173 --> 00:24:45,573
- Some grumpy old man.

384
00:24:45,575 --> 00:24:47,908
I can just hear him.

385
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:52,579
One foot slowly,
then the other.

386
00:24:52,581 --> 00:24:55,515
Up we go.
- Stay off my cupboard!

387
00:24:55,517 --> 00:24:57,783
- Feel for your hold.

388
00:24:57,785 --> 00:25:00,185
- A three-legged cow
could do better than you!

389
00:25:00,187 --> 00:25:01,886
- All right.
Break your necks.

390
00:25:01,888 --> 00:25:03,921
Lean back!

391
00:25:03,923 --> 00:25:06,156
Stop hugging the rock!

392
00:25:08,059 --> 00:25:11,160
- Lizbeth, where are you?
- Aah!

393
00:25:11,162 --> 00:25:12,661
Ooh!

394
00:25:12,663 --> 00:25:13,995
- What goes on here?

395
00:25:13,997 --> 00:25:16,998
- We just fell off
the wunderhorn.

396
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,200
- In your nightclothes?

397
00:25:19,202 --> 00:25:22,937
Get back to your room, lizbeth.

398
00:25:22,939 --> 00:25:27,007
From captain winter, for you.

399
00:25:27,009 --> 00:25:29,576
Important, he says.

400
00:25:29,578 --> 00:25:30,977
He's changed his mind.

401
00:25:33,748 --> 00:25:37,015
- What does he say?

402
00:25:37,017 --> 00:25:41,753
- Read the last part.
I want teo to hear.

403
00:25:41,755 --> 00:25:44,989
- "Only a small token
of admiration and gratitude

404
00:25:44,991 --> 00:25:49,860
of your friend and fellow
climber, John winter."

405
00:25:57,202 --> 00:25:57,702
¶ ¶

406
00:26:07,211 --> 00:26:08,643
- What can I do for you, boy?

407
00:26:08,645 --> 00:26:11,779
- I have a note, sir.
- Oh, good day, miss.

408
00:26:11,781 --> 00:26:13,781
- Herr burgener
hasn't got his spectacles,

409
00:26:13,783 --> 00:26:16,617
and we're in a great hurry.

410
00:26:16,619 --> 00:26:21,021
This is what it says.

411
00:26:21,023 --> 00:26:24,124
"Dear rudi, if you will go to
Alex burgener's shop,

412
00:26:24,126 --> 00:26:25,525
"you will find ordered for you

413
00:26:25,527 --> 00:26:27,026
"some things
that may be useful.

414
00:26:27,028 --> 00:26:29,762
"They are only a small token
of admiration and gratitude

415
00:26:29,764 --> 00:26:33,732
of your friend and fellow
climber, John winter."

416
00:26:38,137 --> 00:26:40,737
Rudi!

417
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,774
- There you are.

418
00:26:45,776 --> 00:26:47,275
- But are you sure, sir?

419
00:26:47,277 --> 00:26:49,877
These boots, they're the best.

420
00:26:49,879 --> 00:26:51,311
- The very best.

421
00:26:51,313 --> 00:26:53,112
Captain winter himself
has been in.

422
00:26:53,114 --> 00:26:54,279
They're what he ordered.

423
00:26:54,281 --> 00:26:55,847
Now I suggest you try them on

424
00:26:55,849 --> 00:26:57,782
and trample around in them
for an hour or so.

425
00:26:57,784 --> 00:26:59,617
Break 'em in for the climb.

426
00:27:08,661 --> 00:27:10,794
- Why was there never
a rich englishman

427
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:11,928
waiting for me in a crevasse?

428
00:27:13,197 --> 00:27:16,798
- But for a guide,
he's not too strongly built.

429
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,199
- Neither was his father.

430
00:27:18,201 --> 00:27:19,967
I say it's good
to see another Matt

431
00:27:19,969 --> 00:27:21,335
going to the mountains at last.

432
00:27:21,337 --> 00:27:22,903
- Good morning, Klaus.

433
00:27:22,905 --> 00:27:26,206
Nice day for a walk.

434
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:33,979
- Good day to you, Franz.
- Captain.

435
00:27:35,315 --> 00:27:38,082
- To keep you safe.

436
00:27:43,322 --> 00:27:44,854
- Come on, rudi.

437
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:35,937
- Well, rudi,
this is a bit different

438
00:28:35,939 --> 00:28:39,073
from roaming about the hills
like a Mountain goat, eh?

439
00:29:22,684 --> 00:29:26,819
- Well done, rudi.

440
00:29:26,821 --> 00:29:28,353
It seems we're not alone.

441
00:29:28,355 --> 00:29:32,256
- No. Johann finecker
brought up a party this morning.

442
00:29:32,258 --> 00:29:36,093
Some of your countrymen. Also
a frenchman, and an Italian.

443
00:29:36,095 --> 00:29:38,095
- Well, the evening
won't be dull.

444
00:29:45,903 --> 00:29:47,736
- Ah, my friend,
if you really want some sport,

445
00:29:47,738 --> 00:29:49,871
you should come to my country.

446
00:29:49,872 --> 00:29:52,005
All the best climbs
are in Italy, eh?

447
00:29:52,008 --> 00:29:53,741
- How many times
have I got to tell you?

448
00:29:53,743 --> 00:29:55,042
- That's all for you tonight.

449
00:29:55,044 --> 00:29:56,209
- Forever back in history,

450
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,710
frenchmen have been
climbing mountains.

451
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:59,912
- Ah, long before history
told of frenchmen,

452
00:29:59,914 --> 00:30:02,981
my ancestors, the romans,
they were at home in the alps.

453
00:30:02,983 --> 00:30:06,317
- Why dwell on past glory when
we have with us the present?

454
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:09,086
Gentlemen,
I give you John winter,

455
00:30:09,088 --> 00:30:11,221
conqueror of 50 mountains,

456
00:30:11,223 --> 00:30:13,990
and by coincidence,
an englishman.

457
00:30:13,992 --> 00:30:17,760
John winter.
- John winter.

458
00:30:17,762 --> 00:30:19,328
- Thank you.

459
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:22,064
Yes, by coincidence,
I am an englishman.

460
00:30:22,066 --> 00:30:23,965
But aren't all of us
who climb mountains

461
00:30:23,967 --> 00:30:25,099
considered a breed apart?

462
00:30:25,101 --> 00:30:27,134
- Yes.
- That's true.

463
00:30:27,136 --> 00:30:28,935
- And now, may I pay
tribute to one

464
00:30:28,937 --> 00:30:33,205
who is already a legend
yet not so far from our time?

465
00:30:33,207 --> 00:30:36,942
I speak, of course,
of the great guide Josef Matt.

466
00:30:36,944 --> 00:30:38,193
- Here, here!

467
00:30:38,194 --> 00:30:39,443
- If there ever was
a Mountain man...

468
00:30:39,446 --> 00:30:41,045
- That was the man.

469
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:42,413
- And may his son
keep alive his name.

470
00:30:42,415 --> 00:30:45,449
- Thank you.
- Now to bed.

471
00:30:45,451 --> 00:30:48,351
- But I'm not tired.
I could stay up all night.

472
00:30:48,353 --> 00:30:50,386
- Off you go,
or I'll put you there.

473
00:30:50,388 --> 00:30:52,888
- Go on, rudi. You need
all the sleep you can get.

474
00:30:54,258 --> 00:30:55,924
- Good night, rudi.
- Good night, rudi.

475
00:30:55,926 --> 00:30:57,025
- Good night.

476
00:30:57,027 --> 00:30:59,160
- Good night, rudi.

477
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:03,797
- John, where are you taking
your party tomorrow?

478
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:05,498
- We're going to make a traverse
along the east face

479
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,800
and try to scale that chimney.

480
00:31:07,802 --> 00:31:09,401
It has not been climbed before,

481
00:31:09,403 --> 00:31:11,336
but I've always had the idea

482
00:31:11,338 --> 00:31:13,538
that if we could scale...

483
00:31:16,543 --> 00:31:24,543
¶ ¶

484
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,454
- good boy!

485
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:39,088
No bundle of firewood here.

486
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:42,091
- So far, so good.

487
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:44,693
- One moment, Franz.

488
00:32:46,096 --> 00:32:48,329
- This is when I'm sorry
for anyone

489
00:32:48,331 --> 00:32:50,964
who's never climbed a Mountain.

490
00:32:50,966 --> 00:32:53,066
- I am too.

491
00:32:59,541 --> 00:33:01,440
- This should happen every day,

492
00:33:01,442 --> 00:33:03,708
and tens of millions of people
never know it.

493
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:05,409
- Come on, captain.

494
00:33:05,411 --> 00:33:08,378
We've still got
this face to climb.

495
00:34:26,191 --> 00:34:28,624
- Look, you can see
the hut, sir,

496
00:34:28,626 --> 00:34:31,093
where my father stayed
on that last night.

497
00:34:31,095 --> 00:34:32,594
Nobody's been there since.

498
00:34:32,596 --> 00:34:35,229
- Come on, rudi. That's not
what we came to see.

499
00:34:35,231 --> 00:34:37,197
- That's what I came to see,
Franz.

500
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,599
- Aren't you going
to the top, captain?

501
00:34:39,601 --> 00:34:41,434
- No.

502
00:34:41,435 --> 00:34:43,268
- In that case,
we might as well eat.

503
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:04,455
- Well, there it is,
the fortress.

504
00:35:04,457 --> 00:35:07,591
That's what always
stood in my way.

505
00:35:07,593 --> 00:35:09,292
Tell me, Franz.

506
00:35:09,294 --> 00:35:12,495
On Josef Matt's attempt,
did he get above the fortress?

507
00:35:12,497 --> 00:35:15,364
- No, only to the base.
- Yes, but I'm sure...

508
00:35:15,366 --> 00:35:17,332
- I heard that
he found a route.

509
00:35:17,334 --> 00:35:20,468
If he did, it must have been
around the east face.

510
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:22,369
- Well...
- What do you think, Franz?

511
00:35:22,371 --> 00:35:24,204
- I don't think about it.

512
00:35:24,206 --> 00:35:26,406
I know nothing of the citadel.

513
00:35:26,408 --> 00:35:27,573
- Wouldn't you like to know?

514
00:35:27,575 --> 00:35:30,208
- No, I would not.

515
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:31,776
It's an evil Mountain.

516
00:35:31,778 --> 00:35:34,111
A killer Mountain.

517
00:35:34,113 --> 00:35:36,746
It's been left alone now
for 16 years,

518
00:35:36,748 --> 00:35:41,150
and it's best to be left alone
forever.

519
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:08,767
Rudi!

520
00:37:09,803 --> 00:37:11,836
- What is it?

521
00:37:50,576 --> 00:37:53,944
- Rudi, stay where you are!

522
00:37:59,584 --> 00:38:02,418
- No, captain.
I'm coming for him!

523
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:04,019
- I'm taller than you are!

524
00:38:04,021 --> 00:38:05,587
It's easier for me to get back!

525
00:38:05,589 --> 00:38:09,591
- He's my nephew,
and my responsibility!

526
00:38:09,593 --> 00:38:11,893
- Wait, Franz!

527
00:38:24,773 --> 00:38:28,808
Franz, it won't hold!

528
00:38:40,788 --> 00:38:42,921
All right, I can hold you now.

529
00:39:32,572 --> 00:39:33,837
- I'm sorry, Uncle.

530
00:39:52,390 --> 00:40:00,390
¶ ¶

531
00:40:26,523 --> 00:40:29,023
- what happened, rudi?

532
00:40:29,025 --> 00:40:32,859
- I thought I found
a better route.

533
00:40:36,397 --> 00:40:39,164
- Hold it there!

534
00:40:39,166 --> 00:40:40,832
Now!

535
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:20,170
- Can you see them?

536
00:41:20,172 --> 00:41:22,639
- Well, yes, they're coming
down the Mountain, but...

537
00:41:22,641 --> 00:41:24,607
- but what?

538
00:41:24,609 --> 00:41:27,910
- When the Porter walks between
the client and the guide,

539
00:41:27,912 --> 00:41:30,712
does it mean something?

540
00:41:43,025 --> 00:41:48,561
- Yes, lizbeth.
I'm afraid it does.

541
00:41:51,065 --> 00:41:53,665
- Don't worry about it, son.
We all make mistakes.

542
00:41:53,667 --> 00:41:54,932
What about the other day,

543
00:41:54,934 --> 00:41:57,801
when I walked
straight into a crevasse?

544
00:42:06,544 --> 00:42:08,977
- Good night, captain.

545
00:42:33,902 --> 00:42:35,568
- I have some business
in Geneva,

546
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:37,603
so I thought I'd take advantage
of the bad weather.

547
00:42:37,605 --> 00:42:39,171
- But you are coming back?

548
00:42:39,173 --> 00:42:43,241
- You know I'm coming back.

549
00:42:43,243 --> 00:42:46,611
Franz,

550
00:42:46,613 --> 00:42:49,046
you know we could climb
the citadel together.

551
00:42:49,048 --> 00:42:50,814
And you know I'd rather
have you with me

552
00:42:50,816 --> 00:42:52,749
than any man in the world.

553
00:42:52,751 --> 00:42:55,251
- Yes, I like to climb
with you too,

554
00:42:55,253 --> 00:42:56,919
but not the citadel.

555
00:43:01,091 --> 00:43:04,092
- Will you make this much
of a bargain with me?

556
00:43:04,094 --> 00:43:05,927
Think about it while I'm gone.

557
00:43:05,929 --> 00:43:08,829
When I return,
we'll talk once again.

558
00:43:15,603 --> 00:43:17,636
Oh, one thing more.

559
00:43:17,638 --> 00:43:20,538
About the boy.
Don't be too hard on him.

560
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:24,742
- The boy's all right.
He's back where he belongs.

561
00:43:35,788 --> 00:43:38,755
- Get along there.
Come on.

562
00:43:54,005 --> 00:43:56,672
- Good boy, rudi.

563
00:43:56,674 --> 00:44:00,342
No bundle of firewood here.

564
00:44:00,344 --> 00:44:03,845
- And may his son
keep alive his name.

565
00:44:03,847 --> 00:44:08,782
- But you... you just couldn't
keep it that way.

566
00:44:08,784 --> 00:44:10,316
You had to go and...

567
00:44:10,318 --> 00:44:13,986
- rudi, it's time
you were at the hotel.

568
00:44:20,193 --> 00:44:23,894
Don't forget to put on
a clean shirt.

569
00:44:40,878 --> 00:44:42,844
- Mother, where are they?

570
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:44,645
- Your Uncle took them.

571
00:44:44,647 --> 00:44:47,014
- But he had no right.
They were mine!

572
00:44:47,016 --> 00:44:49,182
- The axe and the knapsack
he can use.

573
00:44:49,184 --> 00:44:51,317
The boots he will try and sell

574
00:44:51,319 --> 00:44:52,918
to another guide
in the village.

575
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:57,055
The money, of course,
will be yours.

576
00:44:57,057 --> 00:44:59,357
- Why couldn't he leave me
just my boots?

577
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:02,193
- A clean sweep
is always best, rudi.

578
00:45:02,195 --> 00:45:03,794
- It'd be a waste and a shame

579
00:45:03,796 --> 00:45:05,196
for them to lie idle
in the cupboard

580
00:45:05,197 --> 00:45:07,063
when you will have
no further use for them.

581
00:45:24,281 --> 00:45:27,682
- Uh, good morning, rudi.
- Where did you get them?

582
00:45:27,684 --> 00:45:31,318
- From your Uncle Franz.
- Why did he give them to you?

583
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:32,919
- Because he's a businessman,

584
00:45:32,921 --> 00:45:35,054
and I was in a position
to pay him 10 francs more

585
00:45:35,056 --> 00:45:36,188
than Klaus wesselhoft.

586
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:39,157
- Klaus!
Wearing my boots?

587
00:45:39,159 --> 00:45:41,325
- Excuse me,
they are now my boots.

588
00:45:41,327 --> 00:45:45,195
- Excuse me. Your boots,
fraulein hempel.

589
00:45:51,035 --> 00:45:53,668
We saw you come down
the Mountain the other day.

590
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:57,071
- Like a bundle of firewood.
Do you know what happened?

591
00:45:57,073 --> 00:45:59,273
- Not exactly.
What did?

592
00:45:59,275 --> 00:46:04,210
- The worst. The very worst
that could happen to a guide.

593
00:46:04,212 --> 00:46:08,113
I made other people
risk their lives.

594
00:46:08,115 --> 00:46:09,714
I shamed my Uncle.

595
00:46:09,716 --> 00:46:11,449
And worst of all,

596
00:46:11,451 --> 00:46:13,451
I lost captain winter's
faith in me.

597
00:46:13,453 --> 00:46:16,921
- Well, you can change that.
After all, he's coming back.

598
00:46:16,923 --> 00:46:19,123
- He is?
Are you sure?

599
00:46:19,125 --> 00:46:20,824
- Mm-hmm.

600
00:46:22,961 --> 00:46:25,728
- No. I'll never
climb again.

601
00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:29,465
I'd make even a worse guide
than I would a dishwasher.

602
00:46:29,467 --> 00:46:32,034
- You talk like
Klaus wesselhoft,

603
00:46:32,036 --> 00:46:34,469
only he brags
that he's the best.

604
00:46:34,471 --> 00:46:37,939
You just snivel
that you're the worst.

605
00:46:37,941 --> 00:46:40,041
Rudi!

606
00:46:40,043 --> 00:46:42,143
- Have you something else
to say?

607
00:46:42,145 --> 00:46:44,712
- Well, it's not
very important,

608
00:46:44,714 --> 00:46:46,280
but should you ever want
to borrow my boots...

609
00:46:46,282 --> 00:46:48,715
- no, thank you, I won't
want to borrow your boots.

610
00:46:48,717 --> 00:46:50,750
- You'll find them
in old teo's wood box.

611
00:46:50,752 --> 00:46:53,252
- A wood box?
You want the rats to get them?

612
00:46:53,254 --> 00:46:56,188
- The wood box is where
the cat has her kittens.

613
00:46:56,190 --> 00:46:57,789
And I'll wrap them up
carefully.

614
00:46:57,791 --> 00:47:00,191
- First, see you oil them.
And don't forget.

615
00:47:00,193 --> 00:47:02,960
- I won't forget.

616
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:09,899
- Your day off tomorrow,
isn't it?

617
00:47:09,901 --> 00:47:11,934
- Yes.
- Hmm.

618
00:47:11,936 --> 00:47:13,735
Think I'll have a day off too.

619
00:47:13,737 --> 00:47:16,504
Gretchen can give them hash.

620
00:47:16,506 --> 00:47:18,405
Meet me at my house
at 8:00.

621
00:47:18,407 --> 00:47:20,340
- What do you mean?
Where are we going?

622
00:47:20,342 --> 00:47:24,010
- To felsberg.
You're going back to school.

623
00:47:52,005 --> 00:47:53,938
- The loan of your boots,
fraulein hempel.

624
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:57,073
- In exchange for your bundle,
herr Matt.

625
00:47:58,943 --> 00:48:00,509
- You be careful.
Those are my good ones.

626
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:02,178
- You look how you treat
my boots.

627
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:05,948
- Come on, come on, come on.
This isn't a picnic.

628
00:48:07,284 --> 00:48:11,052
Now we'll see once and for all

629
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:15,890
whether you're to be a climber
or a dishwasher.

630
00:48:15,892 --> 00:48:19,260
- We will.
Which face shall I climb?

631
00:48:19,262 --> 00:48:21,228
That little thing?

632
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:25,998
- It won't be so easy,
carrying this.

633
00:48:29,169 --> 00:48:32,102
- But you
can't expect me to...

634
00:48:35,574 --> 00:48:38,575
- let me help you, teo.

635
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:51,453
- That's going to throw me
off balance.

636
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:53,988
- On a real Mountain,
which would you sooner be?

637
00:48:53,990 --> 00:48:55,522
A little off-balance

638
00:48:55,524 --> 00:48:59,259
or dead
from cold and starvation?

639
00:48:59,261 --> 00:49:02,161
Now go on, right up to the top.

640
00:49:02,163 --> 00:49:05,264
- Come on.

641
00:49:05,266 --> 00:49:07,633
I'll race you
to the first ledge.

642
00:49:12,573 --> 00:49:17,108
A three-legged cow
could go faster than you.

643
00:49:24,717 --> 00:49:26,983
- That's as far as you go,
lizbeth.

644
00:49:26,985 --> 00:49:30,186
No nonsense now.

645
00:49:30,188 --> 00:49:33,589
Rudi, you're carrying
a load, a burden.

646
00:49:33,591 --> 00:49:35,724
A real guide carries his pack

647
00:49:35,726 --> 00:49:37,592
as if it were part of his body.

648
00:49:37,594 --> 00:49:39,994
There's a difference, you know.

649
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:24,768
- Come on,
don't build a nest up there.

650
00:50:24,770 --> 00:50:30,173
I'll have something else for you
to do when you come down.

651
00:50:32,110 --> 00:50:34,677
- Teo, I've been up
and down the Mountain,

652
00:50:34,679 --> 00:50:36,345
and I did everything you asked.

653
00:50:36,347 --> 00:50:38,347
Why don't you say something?

654
00:50:38,349 --> 00:50:39,681
- What do you want me to say?

655
00:50:39,683 --> 00:50:41,549
- Did I do well on the climb?

656
00:50:41,551 --> 00:50:44,385
- Oh, well enough,
but it didn't really count.

657
00:50:44,387 --> 00:50:46,453
- Didn't count?
Why not?

658
00:50:46,455 --> 00:50:50,056
- Because you climbed alone.
A guide doesn't climb alone.

659
00:50:50,058 --> 00:50:51,657
- Everybody knows that.

660
00:50:51,659 --> 00:50:55,627
- But did you ever stop to think
what the word "guide" means?

661
00:50:55,629 --> 00:50:57,495
It doesn't mean to
climb up onto a high place

662
00:50:57,497 --> 00:50:59,013
and not fall off, you know.

663
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:00,530
It means to lead others,
to help others,

664
00:51:00,533 --> 00:51:02,299
to think of others
before yourself.

665
00:51:02,301 --> 00:51:04,067
The other day, that foolishness
on the wunderhorn,

666
00:51:04,069 --> 00:51:06,135
how did it happen?

667
00:51:06,137 --> 00:51:08,170
- I told you. I was looking
for a better way down.

668
00:51:08,172 --> 00:51:09,571
- I think you were looking
instead

669
00:51:09,573 --> 00:51:13,207
for a way to impress
captain winter and your Uncle.

670
00:51:13,209 --> 00:51:15,309
- Perhaps.

671
00:51:15,311 --> 00:51:17,210
Captain winter
was my only chance.

672
00:51:17,212 --> 00:51:18,778
He's still my only chance.

673
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:21,580
- Then you did a thing
to be ashamed of.

674
00:51:21,582 --> 00:51:23,615
You were looking for praise
and for gain...

675
00:51:23,617 --> 00:51:25,617
two things your father
never sought...

676
00:51:25,619 --> 00:51:29,587
and he was the greatest climber
of them all.

677
00:51:29,589 --> 00:51:32,756
He could go places other men
could only dream of.

678
00:51:32,758 --> 00:51:35,658
He didn't die because
a Mountain was too high,

679
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:37,826
nor for conquest or glory.

680
00:51:37,828 --> 00:51:39,360
He gave his life

681
00:51:39,362 --> 00:51:43,297
because he thought
only of the man in his charge.

682
00:51:46,201 --> 00:51:51,537
Well, there's one thing more.

683
00:51:51,539 --> 00:51:52,571
- Why are you doing that?

684
00:51:52,573 --> 00:51:54,739
- I'm gonna climb to the top.

685
00:51:54,741 --> 00:51:56,107
- Teo!

686
00:51:56,109 --> 00:51:57,842
- If a teacher
can't trust his own pupil,

687
00:51:57,844 --> 00:52:01,145
why should anyone else?

688
00:52:01,147 --> 00:52:02,613
Where do you think
you're going?

689
00:52:02,615 --> 00:52:06,082
- I'm coming too.
- No, you're not.

690
00:52:08,786 --> 00:52:13,121
- Do you prefer to go barefoot
or wearing my boots?

691
00:52:54,197 --> 00:52:56,730
- All right, come on.

692
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:15,815
- And now for our bundle
of firewood.

693
00:53:21,655 --> 00:53:23,655
- Are you ready?
- Yes, I'm ready.

694
00:53:27,794 --> 00:53:29,860
- Hold tight.

695
00:53:38,369 --> 00:53:40,469
- Are you all right down there?

696
00:53:40,471 --> 00:53:43,805
- Don't worry about me.
Yaah!

697
00:53:58,587 --> 00:54:02,322
Uhh!

698
00:54:02,324 --> 00:54:03,723
Do you feel like going on?

699
00:54:03,725 --> 00:54:05,725
- Of course.

700
00:54:10,298 --> 00:54:15,300
- Not bad, boy.
Not bad at all.

701
00:54:15,302 --> 00:54:17,602
We might make a guide
out of him yet.

702
00:54:17,604 --> 00:54:19,303
- Then you'll have to find
yourself another dishwasher.

703
00:54:19,305 --> 00:54:20,637
- I'll keep him around.

704
00:54:25,210 --> 00:54:27,710
- When captain winter
comes back...

705
00:54:27,712 --> 00:54:29,378
- Captain winter,
captain winter.

706
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:30,645
Don't you ever think
of anyone else?

707
00:54:30,647 --> 00:54:33,748
- Yes. You.

708
00:54:34,784 --> 00:54:36,817
- What about me?

709
00:54:36,819 --> 00:54:38,752
- I don't know.

710
00:54:38,754 --> 00:54:41,688
I guess I never stopped
to think.

711
00:54:41,690 --> 00:54:44,723
- Come on, come on.

712
00:55:12,616 --> 00:55:14,716
- You might ask me if I'm
going to be your partner

713
00:55:14,718 --> 00:55:16,250
for the festival
tomorrow night.

714
00:55:16,252 --> 00:55:17,251
- Well, you are, aren't you?

715
00:55:17,253 --> 00:55:18,585
- Oh, you!

716
00:55:18,587 --> 00:55:20,553
I merely wanted
to know your plans,

717
00:55:20,555 --> 00:55:23,255
since Klaus wesselhoft
has asked me already.

718
00:55:23,257 --> 00:55:25,624
- Klaus wesselhoft?

719
00:55:25,626 --> 00:55:28,026
First my boots, then my girl!

720
00:55:28,028 --> 00:55:29,727
I'll punch him in the nose!

721
00:55:29,729 --> 00:55:36,266
- Rudi, you should climb
a Mountain every day.

722
00:56:03,591 --> 00:56:08,326
- Scorched.
Every last one of them.

723
00:56:11,764 --> 00:56:14,965
- Well, I certainly hope
you enjoyed yourselves.

724
00:56:14,967 --> 00:56:16,700
- Which is more than I can note
for the guests,

725
00:56:16,702 --> 00:56:18,334
you lazy little Lassie.

726
00:56:18,336 --> 00:56:19,635
- As I said to herr hempel,

727
00:56:19,637 --> 00:56:21,870
I wasn't hired to cook.

728
00:56:21,872 --> 00:56:23,571
Oh, and while I remember it,

729
00:56:23,573 --> 00:56:25,472
that captain winter
was here again.

730
00:56:25,474 --> 00:56:27,874
- Teo, did you hear?
- He'd be deaf if he didn't.

731
00:56:27,876 --> 00:56:30,743
He wanted to tell you
good-bye.

732
00:56:30,745 --> 00:56:31,910
- Good-bye?

733
00:56:31,912 --> 00:56:33,044
- He came over this morning

734
00:56:33,046 --> 00:56:34,412
to make some plans
with your Uncle

735
00:56:34,414 --> 00:56:35,946
which didn't work out.

736
00:56:35,948 --> 00:56:38,648
Anyway, he's left.

737
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:42,818
- Left? You mean he's left
kurtal for good?

738
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:44,853
- You had better get something
started for dinner.

739
00:56:44,855 --> 00:56:46,487
- Go on, go on, go on,
go on, go on.

740
00:56:46,489 --> 00:56:48,822
- That's right.
For good.

741
00:57:01,001 --> 00:57:03,534
- Just think of it...
twice the usual fee.

742
00:57:03,536 --> 00:57:06,870
Twice, mind you,
if I climb the citadel with him.

743
00:57:06,872 --> 00:57:10,773
A sum like that, it would be
enough to buy a horse.

744
00:57:10,775 --> 00:57:14,643
And a foolish man
might have been tempted.

745
00:57:14,645 --> 00:57:17,912
What's the use of a horse
to a dead man, eh?

746
00:57:19,682 --> 00:57:20,981
- You did right, Franz.

747
00:57:20,983 --> 00:57:22,949
- Of course I did right.

748
00:57:22,951 --> 00:57:25,451
And any other guide
in his right mind

749
00:57:25,453 --> 00:57:27,486
would have done the same.

750
00:57:27,488 --> 00:57:29,588
- Your Uncle's in good form
tonight.

751
00:57:29,590 --> 00:57:31,122
He's laying down the law
in there.

752
00:57:31,124 --> 00:57:32,123
Can you hear him?

753
00:57:32,125 --> 00:57:34,959
Now listen, boy.

754
00:57:34,961 --> 00:57:38,595
You can't let the englishman or
anyone get you into the world.

755
00:57:38,597 --> 00:57:41,464
In climbing, if you can't get
the hand-hold you want,

756
00:57:41,466 --> 00:57:43,732
you take second best,
and second best is your Uncle.

757
00:57:44,801 --> 00:57:46,367
Why don't you
go over there now,

758
00:57:46,369 --> 00:57:49,002
catch him in this mood,
tell him that tomorrow

759
00:57:49,004 --> 00:57:52,138
you're ready to go out again
as his Porter.

760
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:54,607
- Oh, it wouldn't work.
- How do you know?

761
00:57:54,609 --> 00:57:56,875
You didn't know you could take
us to the top of the felsberg

762
00:57:56,877 --> 00:57:59,611
until you tried.
- Go on, try.

763
00:57:59,613 --> 00:58:00,878
- Yes, go on.

764
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,946
- I know every other guide
in the village

765
00:58:02,948 --> 00:58:05,715
feels the same as I do,
but we're not fools.

766
00:58:05,717 --> 00:58:07,717
We know when something's
impossible.

767
00:58:09,153 --> 00:58:10,852
- Go on.
- Go on.

768
00:58:10,854 --> 00:58:12,020
- Now make me an offer,
and I'll...

769
00:58:12,022 --> 00:58:14,055
I'll make you one just as good.

770
00:58:14,057 --> 00:58:17,825
I said, I'll climb with you
for not twice the usual fee,

771
00:58:17,827 --> 00:58:19,760
but for half.

772
00:58:19,761 --> 00:58:21,694
Any Mountain you like,
any peak from the vicehorn

773
00:58:21,697 --> 00:58:24,798
to the dom,
but he doesn't want that.

774
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:28,034
All he wants
is that cursed Mountain.

775
00:58:28,036 --> 00:58:30,836
The man's obsessed.
He's crazy.

776
00:58:30,838 --> 00:58:32,604
- He is not crazy!

777
00:58:32,606 --> 00:58:34,639
I would pay captain winter
if he would take me with him

778
00:58:34,641 --> 00:58:36,040
when he climbs the citadel.
- You?

779
00:58:36,042 --> 00:58:38,509
You would have to pay.

780
00:58:38,511 --> 00:58:42,646
But where in Switzerland
is there all that money?

781
00:58:44,616 --> 00:58:47,116
Get back to your dishes
before I lose my temper.

782
00:58:47,118 --> 00:58:52,587
What are you doing here anyway?

783
00:58:52,589 --> 00:58:54,288
- I've come to tell you
that no matter what,

784
00:58:54,290 --> 00:58:55,656
I've decided to be a guide.

785
00:58:55,658 --> 00:58:56,857
- What did you say?

786
00:58:56,859 --> 00:58:59,025
- Captain winter
came to see me.

787
00:58:59,027 --> 00:59:00,760
If he still believes in me,
why can't you?

788
00:59:00,762 --> 00:59:04,096
- Captain winter is famous
for believing in the impossible,

789
00:59:04,098 --> 00:59:05,931
but I doubt if even he
would go that far.

790
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:09,767
- Be careful, boy.
I warned you.

791
00:59:09,769 --> 00:59:11,735
Please, Uncle.
Won't you try me?

792
00:59:11,737 --> 00:59:13,603
Let me be your Porter tomorrow.

793
00:59:13,605 --> 00:59:15,571
- No!
- Why not?

794
00:59:15,573 --> 00:59:20,075
- Because I have two hands,
two legs, one head,

795
00:59:20,077 --> 00:59:21,810
and I need those for my clients

796
00:59:21,812 --> 00:59:23,044
and to look after myself.

797
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:25,946
Now get back where you belong.

798
00:59:28,250 --> 00:59:30,316
- We leave early,
do we not, herr lerner?

799
00:59:30,318 --> 00:59:32,685
I think I'll go too
and get to sleep.

800
00:59:32,687 --> 00:59:36,689
- You heard.
So did all the village.

801
00:59:36,691 --> 00:59:38,791
Now everyone knows
that I'm no good,

802
00:59:38,793 --> 00:59:42,294
that my own Uncle
wouldn't have me.

803
00:59:42,296 --> 00:59:45,030
- Let him go, teo.
There's nothing we could say.

804
00:59:45,032 --> 00:59:47,098
- Well, I'm afraid
you lost that partner

805
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:49,100
for the festival tomorrow.

806
00:59:49,101 --> 00:59:51,101
But of course, I'd always...
- Good night, teo.

807
00:59:59,077 --> 01:00:00,609
- ¶ On the Mountain ¶

808
01:00:00,611 --> 01:00:04,779
¶ my shadows dance and play ¶

809
01:00:04,781 --> 01:00:10,817
¶ gone are the cares
of the day ¶

810
01:00:10,819 --> 01:00:13,252
¶ night is here ¶

811
01:00:13,254 --> 01:00:17,222
¶ up there on the hill ¶

812
01:00:17,224 --> 01:00:21,893
¶ sings a haunted lullaby ¶

813
01:00:21,895 --> 01:00:25,796
¶ the bright autumn moon ¶
- Psst! Psst!

814
01:00:25,798 --> 01:00:30,767
¶ In the dark till it goes ¶

815
01:00:30,769 --> 01:00:32,335
- well, herr klausen,

816
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:34,770
I must now get ready
to announce the dancing. There.

817
01:00:34,772 --> 01:00:40,074
- ¶ And the gentle breezes
sigh ¶

818
01:00:40,076 --> 01:00:44,678
¶ ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ¶

819
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:49,849
¶ ooh-ooh-ooh,
ooh-ooh-ooh ¶

820
01:00:49,851 --> 01:00:54,653
¶ ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ¶

821
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:59,790
¶ good night, darling ¶

822
01:00:59,792 --> 01:01:04,795
¶ good night ¶

823
01:01:04,797 --> 01:01:07,998
- and now, everybody, I want you
all to enjoy yourselves.

824
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,066
We start the waltz.

825
01:01:13,371 --> 01:01:17,940
- Rudi!
Where have you been?

826
01:01:17,942 --> 01:01:20,075
The dancing has started
already.

827
01:01:20,077 --> 01:01:22,077
- I'm not coming.
Not after last night.

828
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:26,014
- Oh, rudi, forget about
last night.

829
01:01:26,016 --> 01:01:29,017
Look at me.

830
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:34,354
It's the first year I was able
to wear my grandmother's dress.

831
01:01:34,356 --> 01:01:36,823
Her wedding dress.

832
01:01:36,825 --> 01:01:39,659
- You look nice.

833
01:01:39,661 --> 01:01:41,761
I guess, even pretty.

834
01:01:41,763 --> 01:01:45,231
- Do I?

835
01:01:45,233 --> 01:01:47,900
Really?

836
01:01:47,902 --> 01:01:49,935
Then you must come,

837
01:01:49,937 --> 01:01:52,437
if for no other reason than
somebody said you wouldn't.

838
01:01:52,439 --> 01:01:54,939
- Who said?

839
01:01:54,941 --> 01:01:59,677
- Well, what difference,
as long as it isn't true?

840
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:02,680
- Well, it is true.
How could I go out there?

841
01:02:02,682 --> 01:02:05,916
- Oh, will you stop feeling
sorry for yourself?

842
01:02:05,918 --> 01:02:08,818
- It's almost as though
you enjoyed being unhappy.

843
01:02:08,820 --> 01:02:12,688
Well, I don't.
I want to dance.

844
01:02:12,690 --> 01:02:15,157
¶ ¶

845
01:02:15,159 --> 01:02:17,425
thank you, Klaus.

846
01:02:19,195 --> 01:02:20,727
- Why would you want to dance
with me

847
01:02:20,729 --> 01:02:22,061
if you can have
Klaus wesselhoft?

848
01:02:22,063 --> 01:02:24,930
He says he's the best dancer
in kurtal.

849
01:02:24,932 --> 01:02:28,033
If you've grown up to your
grandmother's wedding dress,

850
01:02:28,035 --> 01:02:29,701
don't you think you should
stop wasting your time

851
01:02:29,703 --> 01:02:32,236
on a kitchen boy?

852
01:02:32,238 --> 01:02:36,273
- Yes, I think I should.

853
01:02:36,275 --> 01:02:44,275
¶ ¶

854
01:02:47,719 --> 01:02:50,352
- rudi. Rudi!

855
01:02:50,354 --> 01:02:50,854
¶ ¶

856
01:03:25,785 --> 01:03:27,317
- And now the polka!

857
01:03:30,288 --> 01:03:33,355
¶ ¶

858
01:03:41,030 --> 01:03:43,397
- You expect us to belief that?

859
01:03:43,399 --> 01:03:45,298
- It's true, I'm telling you.

860
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:47,099
Someone's on the citadel
tonight.

861
01:03:47,101 --> 01:03:49,835
- Nobody's been up there
for years.

862
01:03:49,837 --> 01:03:51,503
- I saw it
from the blue glacier

863
01:03:51,505 --> 01:03:53,171
when we were lighting
the beacon pass.

864
01:03:53,173 --> 01:03:54,839
- Ah, you're dreaming.

865
01:03:54,841 --> 01:03:58,209
- Peter, tell them what you saw
this afternoon.

866
01:03:58,211 --> 01:04:00,945
- Smoke, coming from the old hut
on the southeast Ridge.

867
01:04:00,947 --> 01:04:03,097
- Who'd be up there?

868
01:04:03,098 --> 01:04:05,248
- But you don't get smoke coming
from an empty hut.

869
01:04:05,251 --> 01:04:08,852
I tell you, there must be
someone up there.

870
01:04:08,854 --> 01:04:12,021
- It's no one from kurtal,
I'm sure of that.

871
01:04:12,023 --> 01:04:15,090
¶ ¶

872
01:04:44,184 --> 01:04:48,252
- There's someone outside,
Emil.

873
01:04:48,254 --> 01:04:50,087
- There couldn't be.

874
01:04:50,089 --> 01:04:52,956
- But there is.

875
01:04:52,958 --> 01:04:55,091
Rudi.

876
01:04:55,093 --> 01:04:57,827
What on earth are you
doing here?

877
01:04:57,829 --> 01:04:59,495
- I've come to join you, sir.

878
01:04:59,497 --> 01:05:01,930
- Join me?

879
01:05:01,932 --> 01:05:05,165
- Yes, to climb the citadel.

880
01:05:07,269 --> 01:05:08,401
I know what you're thinking,

881
01:05:08,403 --> 01:05:12,438
but I've learned
since last time.

882
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:16,975
- Oh, Emil saxo of broli,
meet rudi Matt of kurtal.

883
01:05:16,977 --> 01:05:19,377
- Kurtal?

884
01:05:19,379 --> 01:05:22,179
- The son of
the great Josef Matt.

885
01:05:24,116 --> 01:05:26,349
- So?

886
01:05:26,351 --> 01:05:27,850
- Come and have
some breakfast, rudi.

887
01:05:27,852 --> 01:05:30,052
We'll talk this over.

888
01:05:38,494 --> 01:05:41,127
Sit down, rudi.

889
01:05:41,129 --> 01:05:43,095
When did you leave kurtal?

890
01:05:43,097 --> 01:05:44,596
- Late last night, sir.

891
01:05:44,598 --> 01:05:47,131
- And what did your mother
and Franz say about you coming?

892
01:05:47,133 --> 01:05:49,566
- Well, they said
it was all right.

893
01:05:49,568 --> 01:05:51,367
- You mean, they gave
their permission?

894
01:05:51,369 --> 01:05:54,036
- Hmm.

895
01:05:54,038 --> 01:05:55,504
- Why would Franz let you come

896
01:05:55,506 --> 01:05:58,106
if he wouldn't come himself?

897
01:05:58,108 --> 01:06:00,508
- The sun is up.

898
01:06:00,510 --> 01:06:03,377
We'd better get going.
- You're starting today?

899
01:06:03,379 --> 01:06:05,145
- No, today we're just
looking around.

900
01:06:05,147 --> 01:06:07,247
Perhaps we'll follow the Ridge
as far as the fortress.

901
01:06:07,249 --> 01:06:08,648
If we can make it.

902
01:06:08,650 --> 01:06:09,882
- I think we can make it.

903
01:06:09,884 --> 01:06:11,350
I think we should make
a trave...

904
01:06:11,352 --> 01:06:14,186
- we? You mean,
this boy is coming?

905
01:06:14,188 --> 01:06:17,389
- Why not?
He can climb. And well.

906
01:06:17,391 --> 01:06:21,292
- Still, no reason
to drag a boy up 6,000 feet

907
01:06:21,294 --> 01:06:22,926
to the top of the citadel,

908
01:06:22,928 --> 01:06:25,561
no matter whose son he is.

909
01:06:27,264 --> 01:06:30,665
- It's not the citadel
we're climbing today, Emil.

910
01:06:30,667 --> 01:06:33,467
- You are the master.

911
01:06:36,004 --> 01:06:37,503
- Now listen to me, rudi.

912
01:06:37,505 --> 01:06:39,671
One thing must be understood.

913
01:06:39,673 --> 01:06:41,939
There'll be no experimenting.

914
01:06:41,941 --> 01:06:44,541
No individual climbing and no
route-finding of your own.

915
01:06:44,543 --> 01:06:46,643
You'll be an apprentice Porter
and that's all.

916
01:06:46,645 --> 01:06:49,278
- That's enough. I told you,
I've learned my lesson.

917
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:51,980
- All right,
let's make a start.

918
01:06:51,982 --> 01:06:54,482
- All I could find out was,
there's only two of them.

919
01:06:54,484 --> 01:06:55,483
- Did they have equipment?

920
01:06:55,485 --> 01:06:56,517
Porters?
- Nothing.

921
01:06:56,519 --> 01:06:57,484
- No one's been
near that Mountain

922
01:06:57,486 --> 01:06:59,052
for 15...

923
01:07:01,956 --> 01:07:03,288
- what's the matter?

924
01:07:03,290 --> 01:07:04,956
- Haven't you heard the news?

925
01:07:04,958 --> 01:07:06,490
- What news?

926
01:07:06,492 --> 01:07:12,461
- Your friend, the englishman,
is climbing the citadel.

927
01:07:12,463 --> 01:07:14,129
- That's not possible.

928
01:07:14,131 --> 01:07:18,299
- Maybe it's not possible,
but he's trying.

929
01:07:18,301 --> 01:07:21,536
- He may be crazy,
but he's not so crazy

930
01:07:21,538 --> 01:07:23,571
as to try and climb
the citadel alone.

931
01:07:23,573 --> 01:07:25,472
- Who said he was alone?

932
01:07:25,474 --> 01:07:27,407
- You mean, he has a guide?

933
01:07:27,409 --> 01:07:28,808
What guide went with him?

934
01:07:28,810 --> 01:07:32,778
- He's with Emil saxo.

935
01:07:32,780 --> 01:07:34,312
- Who told you that?

936
01:07:34,314 --> 01:07:35,813
- Today, I went to broli
on business,

937
01:07:35,815 --> 01:07:38,715
but no one cared
about business.

938
01:07:38,717 --> 01:07:41,084
- All they would talk about
was this captain winter

939
01:07:41,086 --> 01:07:42,185
and Emil saxo.

940
01:07:42,187 --> 01:07:45,288
How they left yesterday
for the citadel.

941
01:07:45,290 --> 01:07:48,257
- All afternoon, we've been
watching through the telescope,

942
01:07:48,259 --> 01:07:49,291
but we couldn't see them.

943
01:07:49,293 --> 01:07:50,525
- And we won't,

944
01:07:50,527 --> 01:07:52,059
because the Mountain
will strike,

945
01:07:52,061 --> 01:07:53,093
throw them down.

946
01:07:53,095 --> 01:07:55,595
- Saxo.

947
01:07:55,597 --> 01:07:58,297
Emil saxo.
I might have known it.

948
01:07:58,299 --> 01:08:01,633
- Can you see them?

949
01:08:01,635 --> 01:08:03,835
- Yes, I think so.

950
01:08:03,837 --> 01:08:05,720
- Oh!

951
01:08:05,721 --> 01:08:07,604
- And unless there are spots
before me eyes...

952
01:08:07,607 --> 01:08:09,957
you look, lizbeth.

953
01:08:09,958 --> 01:08:12,308
I... I don't want to make
a fool of myself.

954
01:08:13,712 --> 01:08:15,411
- No, teo.

955
01:08:15,413 --> 01:08:17,246
There are no spots
before your eyes

956
01:08:17,248 --> 01:08:18,413
any more than
there were a pair of boots

957
01:08:18,415 --> 01:08:20,348
in the wood box this morning.

958
01:08:20,350 --> 01:08:22,683
- There are three of them?
- Yes.

959
01:08:22,685 --> 01:08:25,686
- They're waiting for me,
over in the tavern.

960
01:08:25,688 --> 01:08:27,421
I mustn't keep them
in suspense.

961
01:08:27,423 --> 01:08:30,357
- Then go,
but don't blurt it out.

962
01:08:30,359 --> 01:08:33,126
Make them suffer.

963
01:08:44,669 --> 01:08:46,602
- Have you seen them, teo?

964
01:08:46,604 --> 01:08:48,403
- I have.

965
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:54,341
- Oh, yes. Yes.

966
01:08:54,343 --> 01:08:57,844
They're up there, all right.

967
01:08:57,846 --> 01:08:59,679
- I think he means it.

968
01:08:59,681 --> 01:09:02,214
- Let's have a look.

969
01:09:02,216 --> 01:09:03,615
- It's no good looking now.

970
01:09:03,617 --> 01:09:05,550
I watched all the time
they were in sight

971
01:09:05,552 --> 01:09:07,285
until they moved in
behind the Ridge.

972
01:09:07,287 --> 01:09:09,487
- Are you sure of this?

973
01:09:09,489 --> 01:09:11,121
You swear that you saw them?

974
01:09:11,123 --> 01:09:14,757
- Marie, a beer.

975
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:19,794
Yes, of course I can swear.

976
01:09:19,796 --> 01:09:21,896
For almost five minutes,
I watched

977
01:09:21,898 --> 01:09:23,864
as they moved up, in a row.

978
01:09:23,866 --> 01:09:28,835
One, two, three.

979
01:09:28,837 --> 01:09:30,870
- Three?
Did you say three?

980
01:09:30,872 --> 01:09:32,872
- That's right.

981
01:09:32,874 --> 01:09:34,707
Thank you, Marie.

982
01:09:34,709 --> 01:09:37,309
- Three?
How could there be three?

983
01:09:37,311 --> 01:09:38,810
- You didn't hear that
in broli?

984
01:09:38,812 --> 01:09:41,612
- No. They said nothing
about a third one.

985
01:09:41,614 --> 01:09:43,614
- Let's drink to him...

986
01:09:43,616 --> 01:09:47,818
to the third man
on the Mountain.

987
01:09:47,820 --> 01:09:49,319
To rudi Matt,

988
01:09:49,321 --> 01:09:52,322
the only true mountaineer
in kurtal.

989
01:09:52,324 --> 01:09:54,457
- Angel face, a mountaineer?

990
01:09:54,459 --> 01:09:58,527
- What are you talking about?
Rudi would be the last.

991
01:09:58,529 --> 01:10:00,896
- It is rudi.

992
01:10:00,898 --> 01:10:04,199
It's my fool of a nephew
who's on the citadel.

993
01:10:04,201 --> 01:10:07,235
His bed was empty when
his mother went to wake him.

994
01:10:07,237 --> 01:10:09,437
An axe and a pack
the englishman gave him

995
01:10:09,439 --> 01:10:12,306
disappeared from my house
during the night,

996
01:10:12,308 --> 01:10:15,275
and he hasn't been
at work all day.

997
01:10:15,277 --> 01:10:17,343
We thought he was sulking,
roaming the hills.

998
01:10:17,345 --> 01:10:19,411
- Instead of saving
your foolish faces.

999
01:10:19,413 --> 01:10:20,745
- Watch what you say, old man.

1000
01:10:20,747 --> 01:10:25,382
- I will, but what I say
is this...

1001
01:10:25,384 --> 01:10:28,551
you call yourselves guides.

1002
01:10:28,553 --> 01:10:30,653
I call you a herd of sheep.

1003
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:32,554
Every day, you go out
and climb peaks

1004
01:10:32,556 --> 01:10:34,255
that have been climbed
100 times before,

1005
01:10:34,257 --> 01:10:36,323
peaks your grandmothers
could climb!

1006
01:10:36,325 --> 01:10:38,725
Then you come back and tell
yourselves how good you are.

1007
01:10:38,727 --> 01:10:41,961
Well, maybe now, you'll find out
you're not so good.

1008
01:10:41,963 --> 01:10:45,931
Three climbers are
on the citadel tonight:

1009
01:10:45,933 --> 01:10:48,967
An englishman,
a man from broli,

1010
01:10:48,969 --> 01:10:51,602
and from kurtal, who?

1011
01:10:51,604 --> 01:10:53,770
A man? No.

1012
01:10:53,772 --> 01:10:55,238
A boy.

1013
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:57,373
An 18-year-old boy,

1014
01:10:57,375 --> 01:10:58,874
who alone among you
is not afraid.

1015
01:10:58,876 --> 01:11:01,643
- Who's afraid?
- You are, big mouth!

1016
01:11:01,645 --> 01:11:02,810
You all are.

1017
01:11:02,812 --> 01:11:05,546
Since Josef Matt died
16 years ago,

1018
01:11:05,548 --> 01:11:07,881
not one of you has dared
set foot on the citadel.

1019
01:11:07,883 --> 01:11:12,985
All right, sit in the tavern,
swill your beer.

1020
01:11:12,987 --> 01:11:15,921
What do you care
if the world no longer knows

1021
01:11:15,923 --> 01:11:18,723
the citadel
as the Mountain of kurtal

1022
01:11:18,725 --> 01:11:22,559
but as the Mountain of broli?

1023
01:11:25,630 --> 01:11:27,396
- You heard what he said,

1024
01:11:27,398 --> 01:11:29,331
and he's lucky
he's standing on his feet.

1025
01:11:29,333 --> 01:11:32,934
I'm not a coward,
nor is any guide of kurtal.

1026
01:11:32,936 --> 01:11:37,004
We are not fools who want to
throw away our lives.

1027
01:11:37,006 --> 01:11:38,739
Too many men have died
on the citadel.

1028
01:11:38,741 --> 01:11:42,342
It has not been climbed,
nor will it ever be.

1029
01:11:42,344 --> 01:11:44,477
This I will do.

1030
01:11:44,479 --> 01:11:46,579
Tomorrow morning,
I will go to the citadel.

1031
01:11:46,581 --> 01:11:49,515
I'll go on until I find
the three who are up there,

1032
01:11:49,517 --> 01:11:52,684
and when I find them,
I shall talk captain winter

1033
01:11:52,686 --> 01:11:54,652
out of his foolishness
and bring down my nephew.

1034
01:11:54,654 --> 01:11:56,320
- I'll go with you.

1035
01:11:56,322 --> 01:11:58,588
- And me.
- Count me in.

1036
01:11:58,590 --> 01:12:01,257
- Also my brother.

1037
01:12:01,259 --> 01:12:04,360
- With myself, that makes five.

1038
01:12:04,362 --> 01:12:05,961
- Six.

1039
01:12:05,963 --> 01:12:07,362
- You?

1040
01:12:07,364 --> 01:12:09,330
- I won't hold you up.

1041
01:12:09,332 --> 01:12:12,933
This is something
I don't intend to miss.

1042
01:12:14,303 --> 01:12:15,368
- All right.

1043
01:12:15,370 --> 01:12:19,004
- Oh, teo, you were wonderful.

1044
01:12:20,607 --> 01:12:23,741
You were beautiful.

1045
01:12:23,743 --> 01:12:27,010
I wish somebody had written
it down for my grandchildren.

1046
01:12:34,851 --> 01:12:42,851
¶ ¶

1047
01:13:14,587 --> 01:13:16,853
- Look out!

1048
01:13:36,607 --> 01:13:38,673
- Captain winter!

1049
01:13:40,777 --> 01:13:43,477
Captain winter.

1050
01:13:44,613 --> 01:13:48,347
- It's nothing.
It just grazed me.

1051
01:13:51,485 --> 01:13:54,352
- Out of the way, boy.

1052
01:13:55,988 --> 01:14:00,991
It was stupid, letting you try
this yourself in this weather.

1053
01:14:00,993 --> 01:14:03,994
- Do you think it was the
Mountain wanting us back, rudi?

1054
01:14:03,996 --> 01:14:05,695
- No, sir.
I agree with herr saxo.

1055
01:14:05,697 --> 01:14:08,064
- We didn't even reach the base
of the fortress.

1056
01:14:08,066 --> 01:14:09,965
- Don't worry about that.

1057
01:14:09,967 --> 01:14:13,068
I've been thinking of a way
past the fortress.

1058
01:14:13,070 --> 01:14:16,071
It's either straight up
or around the other side,

1059
01:14:16,073 --> 01:14:18,006
towards the east face.
- No.

1060
01:14:18,008 --> 01:14:21,009
My father and sir Edward
tried both of those ways.

1061
01:14:21,011 --> 01:14:22,610
Teo says there was no route.

1062
01:14:22,612 --> 01:14:25,713
- Perhaps they didn't try
hard enough.

1063
01:14:25,715 --> 01:14:26,880
- Well, there's no use arguing.

1064
01:14:26,882 --> 01:14:29,983
Let's try and get back
to the hut.

1065
01:14:51,038 --> 01:14:52,137
- You were starting without me.

1066
01:14:52,139 --> 01:14:54,005
- Not to the citadel, rudi.

1067
01:14:54,007 --> 01:14:56,540
Today, we're going down to broli
for tents and supplies.

1068
01:14:56,542 --> 01:14:58,175
We'll be back in the morning.

1069
01:14:58,176 --> 01:14:59,809
The next day,
if the weather's good...

1070
01:14:59,811 --> 01:15:01,076
- am I going to broli with you

1071
01:15:01,078 --> 01:15:02,410
or am I going to stay here?

1072
01:15:02,412 --> 01:15:05,012
- Neither.
You're going back to kurtal.

1073
01:15:05,014 --> 01:15:07,014
- What did I do this time?

1074
01:15:07,016 --> 01:15:10,917
- Nothing. Even Emil
had no complaints.

1075
01:15:10,919 --> 01:15:12,752
I want you to take a message
to your Uncle.

1076
01:15:12,754 --> 01:15:15,020
Tell him it's not too late.

1077
01:15:15,022 --> 01:15:16,554
Tell him I want him with us.

1078
01:15:16,556 --> 01:15:18,522
- What was that?

1079
01:15:18,524 --> 01:15:19,923
Who do you want with us?

1080
01:15:19,925 --> 01:15:23,059
- The boy's Uncle,
Franz lerner.

1081
01:15:23,061 --> 01:15:25,161
- Not with me.

1082
01:15:25,163 --> 01:15:26,595
- What do you mean?

1083
01:15:26,597 --> 01:15:28,530
- A guide from broli

1084
01:15:28,532 --> 01:15:31,065
does not climb
with a guide from kurtal.

1085
01:15:31,067 --> 01:15:32,766
- That's petty and ridiculous.

1086
01:15:32,768 --> 01:15:35,702
Franz lerner is one of the great
guides of Switzerland.

1087
01:15:35,704 --> 01:15:37,937
I've climbed with him
on the vicehorn,

1088
01:15:37,939 --> 01:15:39,939
the dom, the donaldberg.
- But not the citadel.

1089
01:15:39,941 --> 01:15:42,107
When you asked him
to climb the citadel,

1090
01:15:42,109 --> 01:15:44,493
he shook in his boots,
didn't he?

1091
01:15:44,494 --> 01:15:46,878
So you had to come to broli
to find yourself a guide,

1092
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:49,013
a guide who did not
shake in his boots.

1093
01:15:49,015 --> 01:15:50,914
- I know all about that, Emil.

1094
01:15:50,916 --> 01:15:53,216
You weren't afraid, and I
appreciate the fact that...

1095
01:15:53,218 --> 01:15:57,119
- please, let me climb
the citadel with you alone,

1096
01:15:57,121 --> 01:15:59,087
for the honor of my village.

1097
01:15:59,089 --> 01:16:00,988
Alone with you,
not with some...

1098
01:16:00,990 --> 01:16:05,626
some coward of a kurtaler.

1099
01:16:05,628 --> 01:16:07,594
But why worry?

1100
01:16:07,596 --> 01:16:10,129
He won't come anyway.

1101
01:16:13,567 --> 01:16:14,649
- All right, rudi.

1102
01:16:14,650 --> 01:16:15,732
Get your breakfast
and be on your way.

1103
01:16:15,735 --> 01:16:17,668
- Please don't
send me back, sir.

1104
01:16:17,670 --> 01:16:19,236
Herr saxo was right.

1105
01:16:19,238 --> 01:16:20,704
My Uncle wouldn't come.

1106
01:16:20,706 --> 01:16:22,605
And when he sees me...
- Don't argue, rudi.

1107
01:16:22,607 --> 01:16:23,906
Just tell your Uncle
if he lets you come,

1108
01:16:23,908 --> 01:16:26,275
he can come himself.

1109
01:16:26,277 --> 01:16:28,677
We'll meet here
around noon tomorrow.

1110
01:16:28,679 --> 01:16:30,745
- Yes, sir.

1111
01:16:42,925 --> 01:16:50,925
¶ ¶

1112
01:17:25,799 --> 01:17:26,299
¶ ¶

1113
01:18:32,129 --> 01:18:34,028
- My father's route.

1114
01:19:44,530 --> 01:19:46,763
- I wonder if we'll find them
here yet.

1115
01:19:46,765 --> 01:19:50,199
- We'll find no boy
and no Uncle.

1116
01:19:53,337 --> 01:19:56,838
- It seems you're wrong, Emil.

1117
01:20:00,143 --> 01:20:03,344
- Two men
didn't carry all this.

1118
01:20:09,985 --> 01:20:12,218
- Franz, I'm so glad...
- Where's the boy?

1119
01:20:12,220 --> 01:20:13,852
- Well, isn't he with you?

1120
01:20:13,854 --> 01:20:16,554
- How could he be with us?

1121
01:20:18,558 --> 01:20:20,925
Why do you pretend,
when we know he's here?

1122
01:20:20,927 --> 01:20:22,159
- Of course, he was here.

1123
01:20:22,161 --> 01:20:23,827
He left yesterday for kurtal.

1124
01:20:23,829 --> 01:20:25,328
- Why would he go to kurtal

1125
01:20:25,330 --> 01:20:27,263
when three nights ago,
he ran away to join you?

1126
01:20:27,265 --> 01:20:29,999
- Surely he had
your permission?

1127
01:20:30,001 --> 01:20:33,135
- Is that what he told you?
- Yes.

1128
01:20:33,137 --> 01:20:36,505
- He had nobody's permission.

1129
01:20:36,507 --> 01:20:37,873
- Well, have you searched
for him?

1130
01:20:37,875 --> 01:20:40,475
- Yes. Since we got here
at noon yesterday,

1131
01:20:40,477 --> 01:20:42,910
up and down the rock face
as far as the ice fall.

1132
01:20:42,912 --> 01:20:45,579
- Franz, we'd better start
all over again,

1133
01:20:45,581 --> 01:20:47,113
search every crevasse.

1134
01:20:47,115 --> 01:20:49,115
- You're the one
to answer for this.

1135
01:20:49,117 --> 01:20:52,852
- I? What have I
to do with it?

1136
01:20:52,854 --> 01:20:54,854
- Everything.

1137
01:20:54,855 --> 01:20:56,855
Only a guide from broli
would stand by like a dumb ox

1138
01:20:56,858 --> 01:20:58,457
and let a boy be lost!

1139
01:21:01,962 --> 01:21:04,395
- That's enough!
Franz! Saxo!

1140
01:21:04,397 --> 01:21:07,464
- Mother of God!

1141
01:21:07,466 --> 01:21:09,866
- I found it.

1142
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:18,173
I found it.

1143
01:21:18,175 --> 01:21:20,408
- Found what, rudi?

1144
01:21:20,410 --> 01:21:23,344
- The way past the fortress.

1145
01:21:24,580 --> 01:21:26,546
My father's route to the top.

1146
01:21:26,548 --> 01:21:28,014
- All alone?

1147
01:21:28,016 --> 01:21:29,415
You got as far as the fortress?

1148
01:21:29,417 --> 01:21:32,951
I've been up there all night.

1149
01:21:32,953 --> 01:21:35,119
Teo, it's a chimney.

1150
01:21:35,121 --> 01:21:37,554
It leads to the top.
- You climbed it?

1151
01:21:37,556 --> 01:21:40,323
- No.

1152
01:21:40,325 --> 01:21:44,427
There was a storm.

1153
01:21:44,429 --> 01:21:49,131
- So, we weren't crazy
after all, were we?

1154
01:21:49,133 --> 01:21:53,001
No. We knew.

1155
01:22:06,983 --> 01:22:09,416
- Uncle, are you angry?

1156
01:22:09,418 --> 01:22:11,384
- What would be the use?

1157
01:22:11,386 --> 01:22:12,986
- And my mother?

1158
01:22:12,987 --> 01:22:14,587
- So you finally remembered
you had a mother.

1159
01:22:14,589 --> 01:22:16,322
- Every minute, I remembered.

1160
01:22:16,324 --> 01:22:18,090
- That, I doubt.

1161
01:22:18,092 --> 01:22:21,259
But if you don't think of her,
I do.

1162
01:22:21,261 --> 01:22:23,194
I told her that if you
were still alive,

1163
01:22:23,196 --> 01:22:24,662
I'd find you.

1164
01:22:24,664 --> 01:22:27,398
All right, I've found you.

1165
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:29,533
Now I'll take you home.

1166
01:22:29,535 --> 01:22:32,903
Come along. It will be dark
before we reach the trail.

1167
01:22:32,905 --> 01:22:35,906
- The boy isn't going!

1168
01:22:35,908 --> 01:22:38,541
- You stay out of this, teo.
It's none of your business.

1169
01:22:38,543 --> 01:22:40,543
- It is my business.

1170
01:22:40,545 --> 01:22:43,012
I climbed with Josef Matt
on the citadel,

1171
01:22:43,014 --> 01:22:45,114
and I climbed with his son
on the felsberg.

1172
01:22:45,116 --> 01:22:47,116
I know what he can do.

1173
01:22:47,118 --> 01:22:49,802
- Give the boy a chance,

1174
01:22:49,803 --> 01:22:52,487
and he might be even a greater
guide than his father was.

1175
01:22:52,490 --> 01:22:54,957
- He's right, Franz.

1176
01:22:54,959 --> 01:22:57,392
The boy deserves his chance.

1177
01:22:57,394 --> 01:23:00,928
And from me, of all people,
he deserves it.

1178
01:23:00,930 --> 01:23:02,129
You know why.

1179
01:23:02,131 --> 01:23:04,531
Franz, why did you
come up here today?

1180
01:23:04,533 --> 01:23:07,133
- You know why I came.

1181
01:23:07,135 --> 01:23:09,568
I came to take back my nephew.

1182
01:23:09,570 --> 01:23:11,303
- No, you didn't.

1183
01:23:11,305 --> 01:23:14,005
You came because saxo and I
were here,

1184
01:23:14,007 --> 01:23:15,673
and you knew we were going to
climb the citadel.

1185
01:23:15,675 --> 01:23:19,143
- It is true. It was also
because of saxo.

1186
01:23:19,145 --> 01:23:20,410
He has no right here.

1187
01:23:20,412 --> 01:23:23,579
- Not even to step inside
this hut.

1188
01:23:23,581 --> 01:23:27,683
This hut belongs to us,
and so does the citadel.

1189
01:23:27,685 --> 01:23:31,219
The whole world knows it
as the Mountain of kurtal.

1190
01:23:31,221 --> 01:23:33,187
- That will soon be changed.

1191
01:23:33,189 --> 01:23:36,523
- By whom is it to be changed?

1192
01:23:36,525 --> 01:23:39,592
- You listen to me.

1193
01:23:39,594 --> 01:23:41,961
I have listened to you
talking and talking.

1194
01:23:41,963 --> 01:23:43,429
Now you listen to me.

1195
01:23:43,431 --> 01:23:46,365
For ten years,
I have circled the citadel

1196
01:23:46,367 --> 01:23:48,400
and explored the routes to it.

1197
01:23:48,402 --> 01:23:51,403
Did I ever see you
or any other kurtaler?

1198
01:23:51,405 --> 01:23:54,439
How many years has it been
since you slept in...

1199
01:23:54,441 --> 01:23:56,107
in your hut?

1200
01:23:56,109 --> 01:23:58,142
Stood on your Mountain?

1201
01:23:58,144 --> 01:24:01,979
And why did you stir up
your stomachs to come today?

1202
01:24:01,981 --> 01:24:03,513
I'll tell you why.

1203
01:24:03,515 --> 01:24:07,416
Because you are jealous.
Because you're cowards.

1204
01:24:07,418 --> 01:24:12,120
Because you do not want to see
Emil saxo of broli

1205
01:24:12,122 --> 01:24:15,156
do what you are afraid
to do yourselves.

1206
01:24:16,159 --> 01:24:19,226
- Wait!
You think I'm a coward?

1207
01:24:19,228 --> 01:24:21,061
You think I'm afraid
of a Mountain?

1208
01:24:21,063 --> 01:24:22,195
- Well, aren't you?

1209
01:24:22,197 --> 01:24:24,630
- No, I am not.

1210
01:24:24,632 --> 01:24:27,732
I've come here
to climb the citadel.

1211
01:24:29,702 --> 01:24:31,401
- I knew you'd join us, Franz.

1212
01:24:31,403 --> 01:24:34,537
I never doubted it.

1213
01:24:34,539 --> 01:24:36,405
- In that case,
you go without me.

1214
01:24:36,407 --> 01:24:38,440
- No, Emil.

1215
01:24:40,410 --> 01:24:42,343
I need you too.

1216
01:24:42,345 --> 01:24:45,679
We need the strongest team
that ever climbed the alps.

1217
01:24:53,388 --> 01:24:57,289
- The weather is clearing.

1218
01:24:57,291 --> 01:25:01,059
- We leave in the morning,
the four of us.

1219
01:25:02,595 --> 01:25:05,662
That's right, isn't it?
Four to go.

1220
01:25:21,812 --> 01:25:24,813
- Now listen,
this is how it'll be.

1221
01:25:24,815 --> 01:25:27,081
Somebody must go down to kurtal.
I think you, teo.

1222
01:25:27,083 --> 01:25:28,348
- Oh, yeah?
I knew he'd think like that.

1223
01:25:28,350 --> 01:25:29,682
- You'll have a job.

1224
01:25:29,684 --> 01:25:32,418
- I'm also 65 years,
and I don't intend to miss this.

1225
01:25:32,420 --> 01:25:34,337
Besides, you'll need a cook.

1226
01:25:34,338 --> 01:25:36,255
- How about Paul?
He's got to go back anyhow.

1227
01:25:36,257 --> 01:25:37,522
His wife's expecting a child.

1228
01:25:37,524 --> 01:25:39,757
- But I have six children
already.

1229
01:25:39,759 --> 01:25:41,725
Believe me, it's nothing.

1230
01:25:41,727 --> 01:25:43,660
- All right, Paul, you'll go.

1231
01:25:43,662 --> 01:25:46,262
My sister... before anybody,
go to her.

1232
01:25:46,264 --> 01:25:48,397
Tell her only
that we found the boy,

1233
01:25:48,399 --> 01:25:50,532
that he's here at the hut
and all right.

1234
01:25:50,534 --> 01:25:54,602
Don't, on any account, tell her
that he'll be on the Mountain.

1235
01:25:56,539 --> 01:26:01,141
For you, captain,
I'm doing strange things.

1236
01:26:01,143 --> 01:26:04,344
God grant I shan't live
to regret them.

1237
01:26:26,434 --> 01:26:28,667
- Now wait, Emil.

1238
01:26:28,669 --> 01:26:31,136
Let rudi take the lead.

1239
01:26:31,138 --> 01:26:33,605
He's the one who knows the way.

1240
01:26:40,413 --> 01:26:42,479
- Shall I go?

1241
01:26:55,694 --> 01:27:03,694
¶ ¶

1242
01:27:49,546 --> 01:27:50,945
- is that the place, rudi?

1243
01:27:50,947 --> 01:27:54,281
- Yes, sir.

1244
01:27:54,283 --> 01:27:56,283
- How do you know
it goes all the way, boy?

1245
01:27:56,285 --> 01:27:57,384
You didn't climb it?

1246
01:27:57,386 --> 01:27:59,452
- I told you,
there was a storm.

1247
01:27:59,454 --> 01:28:02,321
- Then what do you
really know about it?

1248
01:28:02,323 --> 01:28:05,557
- What do any of us know
until we've examined it?

1249
01:28:07,327 --> 01:28:09,327
I'll take a look at it.
- If you don't mind,

1250
01:28:09,329 --> 01:28:12,963
I'm still first guide.

1251
01:28:12,965 --> 01:28:15,832
Or am I?

1252
01:28:15,834 --> 01:28:19,602
- Yes, Emil,
you're still first guide.

1253
01:28:41,825 --> 01:28:44,425
- I could have told you.

1254
01:28:44,427 --> 01:28:45,826
It tapers off.

1255
01:28:45,828 --> 01:28:49,563
It goes nowhere, and even
if it did go anywhere,

1256
01:28:49,565 --> 01:28:51,798
it's too small
for a man to climb.

1257
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:55,234
- Are you sure?
- Want to come and try it?

1258
01:28:58,372 --> 01:29:01,973
- All right, Emil, we'll go back
and try your way.

1259
01:29:10,416 --> 01:29:14,317
- Oh, it's...
it's nothing.

1260
01:29:14,319 --> 01:29:16,485
Let us go.

1261
01:29:17,988 --> 01:29:19,854
- May I try it?
I still know it's the way.

1262
01:29:19,856 --> 01:29:21,488
Remember that first day?

1263
01:29:21,490 --> 01:29:23,590
Not what happened.
What we talked about.

1264
01:29:23,592 --> 01:29:25,959
That day, you believed.

1265
01:29:25,961 --> 01:29:29,028
There are some things
you just know.

1266
01:29:32,734 --> 01:29:34,066
- All right, rudi.

1267
01:29:34,068 --> 01:29:36,735
I'll give you a hand.

1268
01:30:31,558 --> 01:30:33,958
- Rudi!
Are you all right?

1269
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:36,860
- I'll tell you what it is.
He's stuck.

1270
01:30:41,633 --> 01:30:45,601
He could be stuck there
till the end of his days.

1271
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:53,473
I've done it again.

1272
01:30:53,475 --> 01:30:54,874
- Rudi!

1273
01:30:54,876 --> 01:30:59,478
If you can hear me, answer!

1274
01:31:29,009 --> 01:31:37,009
¶ ¶

1275
01:31:53,499 --> 01:31:55,632
- I did it!

1276
01:32:00,538 --> 01:32:01,937
Hello!

1277
01:32:01,939 --> 01:32:04,506
- Well done, rudi!

1278
01:32:04,508 --> 01:32:06,674
Send down the rope!

1279
01:32:18,821 --> 01:32:26,821
¶ ¶

1280
01:32:26,828 --> 01:32:29,895
- well, there it is.

1281
01:32:31,665 --> 01:32:34,832
- And also, the way between.
We don't know what we'll find.

1282
01:32:34,834 --> 01:32:38,836
- Difficult it is, yes,
but no major obstacles.

1283
01:32:38,838 --> 01:32:41,538
- Two hours will do it.

1284
01:32:43,308 --> 01:32:45,107
- Is your head hurting again,
sir?

1285
01:32:45,109 --> 01:32:47,075
- No, it's nothing.
Let's go on.

1286
01:32:47,077 --> 01:32:49,243
- No, captain, this is no good.

1287
01:32:49,245 --> 01:32:52,212
At the end of the snow,
we'll stop for the night.

1288
01:32:52,214 --> 01:32:54,147
In the morning,
when you're rested,

1289
01:32:54,149 --> 01:32:55,815
we'll go on to the top.

1290
01:32:55,817 --> 01:32:58,217
- But the weather might change.
We may lose our chance.

1291
01:32:58,219 --> 01:33:02,621
- He's right, Franz.
The weather could change.

1292
01:33:02,623 --> 01:33:05,890
- A risk we will take.

1293
01:33:22,306 --> 01:33:24,039
- Franz lerner.
- Hmm?

1294
01:33:24,041 --> 01:33:26,941
- Franz lerner.

1295
01:33:26,943 --> 01:33:29,143
- What is it?

1296
01:33:29,145 --> 01:33:31,111
- Come out here a minute.

1297
01:33:31,113 --> 01:33:32,712
I want to talk to you.

1298
01:33:37,952 --> 01:33:41,086
- What's the matter?

1299
01:33:41,088 --> 01:33:42,687
Is he worse?

1300
01:33:42,689 --> 01:33:44,922
- He is not worse,
but he is not better.

1301
01:33:44,924 --> 01:33:46,623
He won't be able
to go tomorrow.

1302
01:33:46,625 --> 01:33:50,360
It's the end of it for him.

1303
01:33:50,362 --> 01:33:53,363
But it needn't be for us.
- What do you mean?

1304
01:33:53,365 --> 01:33:55,131
- Tomorrow,
the weather will be good.

1305
01:33:55,133 --> 01:33:56,932
After that, who knows?

1306
01:33:56,934 --> 01:33:59,935
If we leave at first dawn,
we could be there by 8:00.

1307
01:33:59,937 --> 01:34:02,771
The boy will stay with him.
He won't be left alone.

1308
01:34:02,773 --> 01:34:05,206
And it's what
he would want us to do.

1309
01:34:05,208 --> 01:34:08,909
- It's not a question
of what he would want.

1310
01:34:08,911 --> 01:34:13,213
A guide, a venerated guide
of kurtal,

1311
01:34:13,215 --> 01:34:17,383
does not leave his client
on a Mountain and go on alone.

1312
01:34:26,794 --> 01:34:28,260
- Do you think he will go on
alone?

1313
01:34:28,262 --> 01:34:31,062
- Even of saxo,
I wouldn't believe it.

1314
01:34:31,064 --> 01:34:32,897
Go to sleep, boy.

1315
01:35:01,259 --> 01:35:03,392
- Let me have a look.

1316
01:35:06,130 --> 01:35:07,395
I see someone.

1317
01:35:07,397 --> 01:35:08,829
- Where?

1318
01:35:08,831 --> 01:35:10,063
- High above the fortress.

1319
01:35:10,065 --> 01:35:11,431
- Only one?

1320
01:35:11,433 --> 01:35:15,234
- Wait.
Now I see two people.

1321
01:35:15,236 --> 01:35:17,736
- No others?

1322
01:35:17,738 --> 01:35:20,371
- No. Just two black...

1323
01:35:20,373 --> 01:35:21,822
- didn't you say
there were four?

1324
01:35:21,823 --> 01:35:23,272
- Well, there were four
yesterday when they started.

1325
01:35:23,275 --> 01:35:26,175
May have changed places
higher up.

1326
01:35:26,177 --> 01:35:27,910
Captain winter
with saxo, probably.

1327
01:35:27,912 --> 01:35:30,279
Hans with rudi.

1328
01:35:31,682 --> 01:35:33,948
I... I mean that...

1329
01:35:33,950 --> 01:35:37,685
- you mean my son
is on the citadel.

1330
01:35:37,687 --> 01:35:40,354
You've lied to me.

1331
01:35:40,356 --> 01:35:43,357
You've all lied to me.

1332
01:35:44,360 --> 01:35:47,227
- Frau Matt.

1333
01:35:47,229 --> 01:35:49,963
- Well, lizbeth,
I hope you're satisfied.

1334
01:35:49,965 --> 01:35:54,100
- Yes. Rudi's doing
what he was meant to do.

1335
01:35:54,102 --> 01:35:56,102
- What right have you to say
what he was meant to do?

1336
01:35:56,104 --> 01:35:57,937
How could you know?

1337
01:35:57,939 --> 01:36:02,241
You've never been a wife,
a mother.

1338
01:36:02,243 --> 01:36:03,842
You've never lost a man.

1339
01:36:03,844 --> 01:36:06,878
- But don't you see?
We both nearly lost a man.

1340
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:09,013
- Why couldn't you
have left him alone?

1341
01:36:09,015 --> 01:36:12,116
- But it was rudi himself.
It wasn't me.

1342
01:36:12,118 --> 01:36:15,152
Nor was it old teo.

1343
01:36:15,154 --> 01:36:19,122
That's what makes it
so right, so wonderful.

1344
01:36:19,124 --> 01:36:21,491
- Would you want to be
the wife of a guide?

1345
01:36:21,493 --> 01:36:25,294
- Yes.
Or a dishwasher.

1346
01:36:25,296 --> 01:36:28,430
Or a hotel proprietor.

1347
01:36:28,432 --> 01:36:30,765
But never
the wife of a hotel proprietor

1348
01:36:30,767 --> 01:36:32,967
who wanted to climb mountains.

1349
01:36:32,969 --> 01:36:35,836
Because a man must do
what he feels he must do,

1350
01:36:35,838 --> 01:36:38,038
or he isn't a man.

1351
01:36:38,040 --> 01:36:41,841
And no one,
wife, mother, or sweetheart,

1352
01:36:41,843 --> 01:36:45,845
has the right to make him into
something he wasn't meant to be.

1353
01:36:45,847 --> 01:36:49,315
I'm sorry you didn't know.

1354
01:36:49,317 --> 01:36:52,484
I'm sorry they lied to you.

1355
01:36:52,486 --> 01:36:55,487
- There's nothing to do now,
is there?

1356
01:36:55,489 --> 01:36:58,756
He'll never be anything
but a guide.

1357
01:36:58,758 --> 01:37:01,058
- No, frau Matt.

1358
01:37:05,030 --> 01:37:06,929
- Where are the others, Franz?
What happened?

1359
01:37:06,931 --> 01:37:08,864
- Gone, the two of them.

1360
01:37:08,866 --> 01:37:10,866
It's what saxo threatened
last night

1361
01:37:10,868 --> 01:37:12,968
when he said
you were too sick to try.

1362
01:37:12,970 --> 01:37:14,769
And that crazy boy
has gone after him.

1363
01:37:14,771 --> 01:37:17,404
- All right, I'm ready.
- Ready for what?

1364
01:37:17,406 --> 01:37:19,939
- To go after them.
- No, captain, you're too weak.

1365
01:37:19,941 --> 01:37:22,808
- I'm much better.
The pain's gone.

1366
01:37:22,810 --> 01:37:25,310
- Then, if you don't mind
staying here for a few hours,

1367
01:37:25,312 --> 01:37:27,245
I'll go on...
- I mind very much.

1368
01:37:27,247 --> 01:37:29,213
We're going together.

1369
01:37:29,215 --> 01:37:33,083
Don't worry. I won't be
a bundle of firewood.

1370
01:37:41,259 --> 01:37:49,259
¶ ¶

1371
01:38:15,290 --> 01:38:16,856
- Aah!

1372
01:38:21,262 --> 01:38:29,262
¶ ¶

1373
01:38:37,844 --> 01:38:40,444
- herr saxo, don't move!

1374
01:38:45,918 --> 01:38:47,984
Herr saxo, you're hurt.

1375
01:38:50,188 --> 01:38:52,087
- You're badly hurt.

1376
01:38:52,089 --> 01:38:54,489
I'll make you a sling.

1377
01:38:54,491 --> 01:38:56,357
- Ah, let me alone!

1378
01:38:56,359 --> 01:38:59,326
I don't need help from you.

1379
01:39:00,896 --> 01:39:05,098
Go on back.
You've won.

1380
01:39:05,100 --> 01:39:09,001
Climb to the top
and crow like a cock.

1381
01:39:11,171 --> 01:39:17,074
- Herr saxo, there must be
some way I can hold you.

1382
01:39:17,076 --> 01:39:20,110
- Go on, boy.
Go on, kitchen boy.

1383
01:39:20,112 --> 01:39:22,378
You've won, I'm telling you.

1384
01:39:22,380 --> 01:39:24,346
And I've lost.

1385
01:39:24,348 --> 01:39:27,649
Claim your victory.
Leave me.

1386
01:39:27,651 --> 01:39:31,285
You've left the others.
Why not me?

1387
01:39:31,287 --> 01:39:35,588
I'm nothing to you,
not even a friend. Go on.

1388
01:39:37,892 --> 01:39:42,494
That's it.
You're no fool.

1389
01:39:42,496 --> 01:39:44,362
Take it.

1390
01:39:44,364 --> 01:39:47,231
You'll be a hero.

1391
01:39:47,233 --> 01:39:49,566
Conqueror of the citadel.

1392
01:39:49,568 --> 01:39:52,268
Your father's son.

1393
01:40:00,143 --> 01:40:01,642
- I'm making you a sling.

1394
01:40:01,644 --> 01:40:04,378
Since we can't go up,
we'll go down.

1395
01:40:15,290 --> 01:40:17,223
- It's rudi's pack.

1396
01:40:17,225 --> 01:40:18,424
- Rudi!

1397
01:40:21,362 --> 01:40:24,296
Rudi!

1398
01:40:26,333 --> 01:40:28,934
He must have fallen.

1399
01:40:28,935 --> 01:40:31,536
- He could fall, and his pack
would still be on his back.

1400
01:40:31,538 --> 01:40:34,305
We'd better push on.

1401
01:40:36,342 --> 01:40:38,475
- We can pick those things up
on the way down.

1402
01:40:38,477 --> 01:40:42,645
- He brought these
all the way up from kurtal.

1403
01:40:42,647 --> 01:40:44,680
I think he'd like them
at the top.

1404
01:41:25,155 --> 01:41:27,989
- Aah!

1405
01:41:27,991 --> 01:41:31,058
- Herr saxo!

1406
01:41:32,494 --> 01:41:34,393
I'm done.
Finished.

1407
01:41:34,395 --> 01:41:37,529
- You can't stop now.

1408
01:41:37,531 --> 01:41:40,031
The tents are just below.

1409
01:41:42,435 --> 01:41:47,270
- No, boy.
You leave me here.

1410
01:41:47,272 --> 01:41:48,571
You'll never get me down.

1411
01:41:48,573 --> 01:41:50,773
- I will get you down.

1412
01:41:50,775 --> 01:41:54,643
Now just try! Try!

1413
01:43:36,512 --> 01:43:39,346
- Thanks, boy.

1414
01:44:00,535 --> 01:44:03,602
¶ ¶

1415
01:44:21,888 --> 01:44:23,654
- come, lizbeth.

1416
01:44:23,656 --> 01:44:26,690
- No, it should only be you.

1417
01:44:26,692 --> 01:44:28,425
My turn will come.

1418
01:44:31,496 --> 01:44:34,796
- I'm sorry
if I made you worry again.

1419
01:44:35,865 --> 01:44:38,565
You're not angry.

1420
01:44:38,567 --> 01:44:41,501
You're happy.
- Yes, rudi.

1421
01:44:41,503 --> 01:44:43,836
And very proud.

1422
01:44:55,415 --> 01:44:58,616
All the conquerors
of the citadel,

1423
01:44:58,618 --> 01:45:02,519
which stands above our valley,

1424
01:45:02,521 --> 01:45:04,921
there it will stand forever,

1425
01:45:04,923 --> 01:45:07,790
and all men will know it

1426
01:45:07,792 --> 01:45:11,660
by your names,
as your Mountain.

1427
01:45:17,999 --> 01:45:19,865
- Forgive me, herr hempel
but you're wrong.

1428
01:45:19,867 --> 01:45:23,401
It's not our Mountain.
It's rudi's Mountain.

1429
01:45:24,771 --> 01:45:27,671
Rudi.

1430
01:45:27,673 --> 01:45:29,739
Rudi, come up here.

1431
01:45:29,741 --> 01:45:31,540
- Go on.

1432
01:45:32,643 --> 01:45:34,909
- I didn't even
get to the top, sir.

1433
01:45:34,911 --> 01:45:35,976
- Look.

1434
01:45:44,886 --> 01:45:46,719
- You carried it up.
You put it there.

1435
01:45:46,721 --> 01:45:49,955
- No, rudi, you put it there.

1436
01:45:49,957 --> 01:45:52,490
You and your father.

1437
01:45:52,492 --> 01:45:54,725
- That is true.

1438
01:45:54,727 --> 01:45:56,493
He could have been the first.

1439
01:45:56,495 --> 01:45:59,062
- And so could his father.

1440
01:45:59,064 --> 01:46:02,432
- Long live our dishwasher!
Bravo!

1441
01:46:08,338 --> 01:46:09,670
- Well, say something, rudi.

1442
01:46:09,672 --> 01:46:11,071
Don't just stand there
like a lump.

1443
01:46:11,073 --> 01:46:13,807
Invite them up to see.
- Where's lizbeth?

1444
01:46:13,809 --> 01:46:15,809
- There she is.
- Here I am, rudi.
