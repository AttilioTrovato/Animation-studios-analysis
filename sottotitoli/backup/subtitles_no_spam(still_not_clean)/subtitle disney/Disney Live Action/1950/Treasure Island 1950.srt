1
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:31,150
Glass of double rum.

2
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,124
Aah. This here is a quiet cove.
Much company, mate?

3
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,293
Not much, sir.

4
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:52,004
- Who'd be the owner?
- My mother.

5
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:54,756
- Where is your mother?
- In the town.

6
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,258
Hmm.

7
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:01,430
- What's your name?
- Jim Hawkins.

8
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:05,184
Well, Jim, you seems a likely lad.

9
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:08,604
Ever notice a seafaring man
alongside this here grogshop?

10
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:10,439
Not many come out so far, sir.

11
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:13,108
None by the name
of Captain William Bones?

12
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:16,862
Bones, sir?

13
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:26,705
No matter. Fill her up.

14
00:03:58,821 --> 00:03:59,863
Jim!

15
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:06,745
- Was it a one-legged man?
- No, sir.

16
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,832
But he had a terrible scar.

17
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,835
Black Dog!

18
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:19,091
When you sees Black Dog, you lay to it.

19
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:21,760
The man with the one leg ain't far off.

20
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,681
Rum, Jim. Fetch me rum.

21
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:29,393
I can't, Captain. I promised Dr. Livesy.

22
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:33,230
Oh, hang all doctors! Give me rum!

23
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:42,864
No, Captain!

24
00:04:57,588 --> 00:05:00,799
Please, Captain Bones.
Doctor said it'd kill you!

25
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:05,387
If you don't stop,
I'll run to town for the Doctor.

26
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,930
And the Squire, too.

27
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:15,397
Got to get me strength back, Jim.

28
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:17,983
Got to pull out of here.

29
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:51,099
Now, then, boy,
take me to Captain Billy Bones,

30
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,934
or I'll break your arm.

31
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:57,439
Straight to him, now. March!

32
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,619
Here's a friend for you, Bill.

33
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:15,874
- It's Pew.
- Pew as ever was, Bill.

34
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:21,296
Back with a gift
from all your old shipmates.

35
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:25,634
Boy, take him by the wrist
and bring his hand close to mine.

36
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:34,476
And now that's done.

37
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,493
The black spot.

38
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,168
They come at dark.

39
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:04,089
I know what they're after,
but they won't get it out of me.

40
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:07,175
What's rightful mine is mine!

41
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:11,721
Give me a hand, Jim.
We'll do that one-legged man yet!

42
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:24,419
Captain!

43
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,338
Captain!

44
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:40,101
The old hulk's grounded, Jim.

45
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,271
Can't shove off.

46
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,276
Go and bring help.

47
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,611
And don't peach,

48
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,113
and I'll go shares.

49
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:07,128
If them muttonheads
that slipped me the black spot

50
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,673
gets here before you come back,

51
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,300
they won't find that on me.

52
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,302
Skip, now.

53
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:19,641
Luck, matey!

54
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:12,068
Rouse out, mates!
Horses coming! Run for it!

55
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,727
Here, sir.

56
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,070
Well, Livesy?

57
00:10:57,239 --> 00:11:02,410
Did his doomsday. But he wasn't killed.
He died of shock, or rum.

58
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,829
I wonder what those rascals
wanted of him.

59
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,915
I think I can tell you, Squire Trelawney.

60
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,669
Now he's dead, I can.

61
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,348
Odds, my life!

62
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,767
Doctor!

63
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:29,771
Flint's map.
How did you come by it, lad?

64
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:32,607
Why, he gave it to me, sir,
when he sent me for help.

65
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,110
- He said I'd share.
- Share what?

66
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:38,113
You don't know? Pirate treasure, man!

67
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:42,992
Flint's gold! Why, everybody knows
of the ships Flint plundered.

68
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:46,955
That fellow must've been the only one
who knew where the treasure was hid.

69
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:49,457
So that's what
those scoundrels wanted.

70
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,793
The map of Flint's Treasure Island!

71
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:54,212
Latitude, longitude,

72
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:58,299
crosses to mark the deposits.
Money to roll in!

73
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:02,512
You're a trump, young Hawkins.
Mark my words, you will share.

74
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:08,685
Spy Glass Hill bearing south-southeast,
to Finger Trunk Tree by Devil's Rock.

75
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:11,229
Thence two cables south...

76
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,190
- Go on, go on!
- Bear to larboard,

77
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:18,820
due northeast to foot of White Crag,
10 paces east...

78
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:23,992
Chest of Â£700,000!

79
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:28,246
My servants, Livesy.

80
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,500
Come in, Tom Redruth!
Come in, Williams!

81
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:33,668
They got away, sir.

82
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,754
They had a lugger
tied up at Kitt's Hole, sir.

83
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:41,009
Aye, you gave them a run for it, boys.
They'll not be back.

84
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:45,555
Thank you, Tom Redruth.
Thank you.

85
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,348
Thank you, sir.

86
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,687
Shh.

87
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,105
Mum's the word.

88
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:57,025
We'll take Redruth and Williams along.
Make sailors of them.

89
00:12:57,067 --> 00:13:00,069
We'll have favorable winds,
a quick passage,

90
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,071
and gold enough
to play duck and drake

91
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,948
with ever after, hey, Hawkins?

92
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,534
If you weren't so confounded
exclamatory, Trelawney,

93
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:08,203
we might understand you better.

94
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,038
Just what is it you propose to do?

95
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,791
Do? Fit out a ship! That's what I'll do!

96
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,876
With a clue like this, by Christopher,

97
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,378
we'll have Flint's treasure
if it takes a year!

98
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,714
Can't you feel the deck under your feet,

99
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,050
and a good trade wind filling our sails?

100
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:25,386
How preposterous. A doctor
can't go chasing across the world

101
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,888
and leave his practice behind him.

102
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:29,224
Hang your practice. I'm your practice.

103
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,267
Do you think I'd put to sea
without a ship's doctor?

104
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:33,311
Besides, it's a risky business.

105
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:35,980
We aren't the only ones
who know of Flint's map.

106
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:39,442
Those fellows who ransacked
this inn tonight are desperate men.

107
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:43,571
Surely, you don't fear them, Livesy?

108
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,407
No. There's only one man I'm afraid of.

109
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,909
Name the dog.

110
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,245
You, sir.
For you can't hold your tongue.

111
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:53,456
Why, confound you, Doctor.
I'm no tittle-tattle.

112
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:56,417
An adventure of this kind,
I'd be silent as the grave.

113
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:57,627
Now, then, Hawkey.

114
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:59,754
Tomorrow, I start for Bristol
to find a ship.

115
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:02,590
Once you settle your affairs here,
you and Jim can follow.

116
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:05,260
- Jim?
- Aye, Hawkins. You'll come.

117
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:07,262
You'll make
a famous cabin boy, Hawkins!

118
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:09,639
His mother may have
something to say about that.

119
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:16,187
She'd listen to you, sir,
if she knew you were going.

120
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:20,149
Until I've made up my own mind,
I don't know what I could tell her.

121
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:24,779
Tell her that in three weeks' time...
Three weeks? Two weeks! Ten days!

122
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:28,283
Jim Hawkins will be sailing
with the choicest crew

123
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:31,160
and the finest
ship's doctor in all England.

124
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,287
Will you, sir?

125
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:35,456
To be sure he will, boy!
I'll wager my wig on it.

126
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,655
Dr. Livesy! Dr. Livesy!

127
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,157
Look, Doctor. It's Squire Trelawney!

128
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,746
Admiral Trelawney, at least.

129
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,706
Livesy. Ahoy!

130
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,499
Ahoy!

131
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:22,337
And Jim.
How did you two find the journey?

132
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,172
Abominable roads.

133
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,341
The sea's the only
high road for an Englishman.

134
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:28,009
Come here.

135
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,347
There she rides, Livesy.

136
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,849
The good ship Hispaniola.

137
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:41,689
- Beautiful, Trelawney! Beautiful!
- Stout, too.

138
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:45,026
She'll bring back all the pirate gold
that we can put aboard her!

139
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,904
Shh. No talk of treasure
in a public place. I beg of you.

140
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,197
Aye, mum's the word.

141
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:50,907
Jim?

142
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:05,129
Well, Jim, don't you want to eat, lad?

143
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,215
If there's time before we sail, sir.

144
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,717
- Sail.
- When do we sail?

145
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,638
Better ask Captain Smollett.
Five days he's been selecting a crew.

146
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:16,557
- Six men are all he's got to show for it.
- Cautious, eh?

147
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,768
"Cautious"?
He pries through every seaman's past

148
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:21,062
like a judge at a quarter session.

149
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:24,399
When I threatened to step in,
he told me to hire a sea cook.

150
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:28,069
So, by Jove, I did hire a sea cook,
right out of his own tavern.

151
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,572
Fellow by the name of Long John Silver.

152
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,575
I didn't waste my time
poring over his credentials.

153
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:38,329
All the credentials I needed was a taste
of his ham and his buttered eggs.

154
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,581
You can judge for yourself.

155
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:47,088
- Top of the mornin', gentlemen.
- Ahoy, John Silver.

156
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,429
Sit ye down,
the tables are starving, if ye kindly will.

157
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:19,954
For you, sir, piping hot.
And this be for Dr. Livesy.

158
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,958
Asking his pardon
for being that familiar,

159
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:27,295
but Squire has told me
so much about the two of ye,

160
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:30,465
it comes natural
to call ye by name, it do.

161
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:37,305
And this will be young Master Hawkins,
I'll be bound.

162
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:41,309
Hawkins.
'Tis a proper seafaring name, too.

163
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:45,563
You run your house well, my man,
and you keep a good table, too.

164
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:47,356
Thank ye kindly, sir.

165
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:50,234
It isn't often I see fruit
in an English tavern for breakfast.

166
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,988
'Tis a rule of health I learned while
sailing under the immortal Hawke.

167
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:57,867
- Ah. Rest him.
- Did you hear that?

168
00:17:57,993 --> 00:17:59,368
Him, sailing under Hawke!

169
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,204
I was with him
in '59 at Quiberon Bay.

170
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,538
When you shipped with the Admiral,

171
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:05,833
you never took scurvy
from the salt pork and hardtack.

172
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:09,045
Not with a barrel of apples aboard
for the men to chew on.

173
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:12,340
There's sense in that, Trelawney.
Something we could profit by.

174
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:16,052
And will, by gad.
There'll be apples on my ship, too.

175
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:19,847
You favor the Admiral yourself,
Squire, if I may say so.

176
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:23,017
Why, you and he could make up
your mind like that!

177
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:27,105
- Do I now?
- That ye do, sir. I noticed it afore.

178
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:30,525
It wouldn't surprise me none
to hear you say,

179
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:34,028
"Heave up the anchor.
We sails on the hour."

180
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,696
Can't sail without a crew.

181
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,448
With all the hemming
and hawing that goes on,

182
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,700
you'd think there wasn't
an honest seaman to be had in Bristol.

183
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:43,704
I begs to differ, sir,
if I may make so bold.

184
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:47,875
Why, there's a full cargo
of my old shipmates

185
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:53,548
that sailed with Hawke
becarrmed right here in Bristol.

186
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,591
Sound men inside,

187
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:59,220
if some of them was scarred
in the service of England.

188
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,306
And they with no pensions, neither.

189
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:10,064
Could a score of those foremost hands
be had on short notice?

190
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:13,734
Aye, sir, but they wouldn't be
pretty enough for the modern taste.

191
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:17,488
Nowadays, they picks the younger men
by the cut of their jib.

192
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,907
Not the old ones for their experience.

193
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:23,494
Appearances be hanged!
Silver, get me those men.

194
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:27,748
But it ain't a cook's place
to muster no hands.

195
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:28,833
That's captain's work.

196
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:31,002
It's an owner's place, by the hokey.

197
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:34,255
If you can bring in a crew of your
stouthearted lads come sundown,

198
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:35,923
I, for one, will be greatly obliged.

199
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,969
- Well, sir, if 'tis owner's orders...
- Bully boy.

200
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:44,932
But I don't like to be pushing
athwart my betters, but I'll say this, sir,

201
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:49,103
I know every seaman in these
here parts like the palm of this hand.

202
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,272
Did you know Captain Billy Bones?

203
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:56,527
Bones?

204
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,654
Billy Bones?

205
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,616
What ship did he sail in, matey?

206
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,950
He was a pirate.

207
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,876
Lord love ye, lad.

208
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,463
Didn't you know that them that
sailed with Admiral Hawke

209
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:18,466
had no speaking
acquaintance with pirates?

210
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:20,551
Lessen they boarded us.

211
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,013
Aye, Jim,

212
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:27,016
you're the spitting image
of me when I was your age.

213
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:29,727
Head full of pirates.

214
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:35,066
But he'll find, same as I,
that the sea be mostly hard work.

215
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:39,195
And the biggest satisfaction
a man gets is doing his duty.

216
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,989
Quite right, eh, Jim?
Come, Livesy. Shall we go aboard?

217
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,158
But I just thought
if he knew Billy Bones...

218
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:47,995
'Course you did. Of course he did.

219
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:53,584
Beggin' your pardon, Squire.
Could ye spare me the lad today?

220
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,086
I've more than my hands full

221
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:58,381
putting the inn shipshape
and rounding up a crew.

222
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,508
Sound idea.
You stay and lend him a hand, Jim.

223
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:03,386
- But, sir...
- Don't fail me, Silver. Livesy.

224
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,098
Come now, Jim, lad. Time be wasting.

225
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:28,703
Down there, matey.

226
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:36,711
Pieces of eight!
Pieces of eight!

227
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:39,797
Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight!

228
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,883
Who hailed you, you old bumboat?

229
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:48,556
Belay!

230
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,057
Belay! Belay!

231
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,268
Ain't you the pretty one?

232
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:56,063
Swearing blue fire
in front of a gentleman.

233
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,607
Living up to her name, she be.

234
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:03,154
Captain Flint, I calls her,
after the famous buccaneer.

235
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,448
'Twas the pirates taught her to swear.

236
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:10,786
Now, if you want to know about pirates,
just you ask Captain Flint.

237
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:12,913
Why she can...

238
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:16,250
Well, blow me down for an old sea calf.

239
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,627
"Do you know any pirates?" says you.

240
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:21,589
"Not on speaking terms," says I.

241
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:25,343
Yet, here, under my nose,
is Captain Flint.

242
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:30,431
I'll wager you can't make her talk.

243
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:37,772
Pirates, Captain Flint! Pirates!

244
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:42,651
Pieces of eight! Hello, boy. Hello.

245
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:47,114
You're a smart one, Jim.
Smart as paint you are!

246
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:53,037
'Tain't everyone can make that bird talk.

247
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:56,123
Hey there!
Glass of double rum.

248
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,963
Black Dog! Stop him!

249
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:05,674
Stop him!

250
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,260
Cady. Run, catch him!

251
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:15,851
No. Not him. Him!

252
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:19,980
- Who did you say he was?
- Black Dog.

253
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:22,191
He was one of the...

254
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:27,488
He was one of the pirates.

255
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:30,157
One of them swabs? After him, all of ye!

256
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:32,034
Run him down!

257
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,662
And if you don't catch him,
don't you come back!

258
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:42,545
What was he doing here,
I'd like to know.

259
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:47,967
Sharks like him,
they'll give my house a bad name.

260
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:51,846
What would the new landlord say?

261
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:55,558
Why, he'd never set foot
in the place again.

262
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:56,851
Now, would he?

263
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:02,648
Black Dog, eh? I'll black dog him.

264
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:06,110
I never thought the day'd come
I'd need this pistol

265
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:07,987
against them cutthroats.

266
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,907
Heavy ball and a light charge of powder

267
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:15,035
works best on a touchy
little craft like this, here.

268
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:19,081
Try the balance?

269
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:24,962
See the engraving on the trigger guard?

270
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,340
Solid silver.

271
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:33,262
Butler of London made that there
sidearm for Admiral Hawke.

272
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:37,308
And the Admiral,
he give it to me for loyal service

273
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:39,477
aboard the old Portland.

274
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:45,107
Do ye think you could shoot one?

275
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,776
- Oh! Yes, sir.
- All right, then.

276
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:52,364
You are a smart one.

277
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:56,118
I might've known
you could handle a firearm.

278
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:02,291
Now, put it in your pocket
and keep it there at half cock.

279
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:06,295
But don't go waving it in the face of
every man who asks for a glass of stout.

280
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:09,006
- Oh, no, Mr. Silver.
- But if you clamps your dead lights

281
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:12,676
on that there Black Dog again,
repel boarders.

282
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:15,095
- I know, sir.
- And I knows a lad I can trust

283
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,890
while I'm out doing my duty by Squire.

284
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:21,352
And when I come back,
I'll have a crew and you'll have a pistol.

285
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:26,982
- You mean to keep?
- That's my meaning, matey.

286
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:30,653
You've got the word
of Long John Silver.

287
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:35,282
- Shipmates.
- Shipmates.

288
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,051
Boat alongside, sir.

289
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,648
Step lively there. Get a move on.

290
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:20,869
- Get up. Get up with us.
- Ahoy!

291
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:25,499
Line up there.

292
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:30,254
All hands muster aft.

293
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:36,176
Long John Silver,
reporting as ordered, sir.

294
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:39,305
- I see you did it, Silver.
- Like I said, Mr. Trelawney,

295
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:42,641
they ain't pretty,
but they knows the sea.

296
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:45,644
Picked up Hawke's old helmsman,
we did.

297
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:49,315
And a boatswain what
pipes man-o'-war fashions.

298
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:52,151
- Splendid, Silver. Splendid!
- Heave to!

299
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:56,614
Captain.

300
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:03,412
Well, Captain, here's your crew.

301
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:05,372
Would you care
to have a word with them?

302
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:08,709
- Mr. Arrow?
- Yes, sir.

303
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,628
Record the names and sailing records

304
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:13,213
of every man jack on board
for entry into the log.

305
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:16,050
- And check your watches.
- Aye, aye, sir.

306
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:18,802
Step forward, there. Step lively.

307
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:21,930
And now, sir, I'd like to have a word
with you in the cabin, if I may.

308
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:24,767
And you, Doctor.

309
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:30,814
Fetch your gear and take it below.

310
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:42,242
Captain Smollett,
here's to our speedy departure.

311
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:44,745
Thank you, sir.
Well, I have something on my mind,

312
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:47,498
and at the risk of giving offense,
I'd better speak plain.

313
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:50,250
I don't like this cruise
and I don't like the men.

314
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,628
Possibly, sir, you may not like
your employer, either.

315
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:55,923
Stay a bit, Trelawney. No need for ill
feeling till we hear the captain out.

316
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:58,759
I don't like secret voyages,
Mr. Trelawney,

317
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:02,137
when the only secret kept
is the one in my sealed orders.

318
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:04,014
Everybody else
about the town is saying

319
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:08,143
that we're headed for a treasure island
with a marked map to guide us.

320
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:09,978
Someone's been talking.

321
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:13,649
Well, I never breathed a word.
Livesy, have you?

322
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:18,362
In my experience, adventure
of this kind may mean life and death,

323
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:20,197
and a close run.

324
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:22,616
We may need a trustworthy crew.

325
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:24,952
Not one recruited by the ship's cook.

326
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:27,329
That ship's cook was acting
under my orders, sir!

327
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:29,498
Well, is the cook responsible
for the ship's safety?

328
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:31,375
Well, really! I...

329
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:37,381
We're all concerned
with the ship's safety, Captain.

330
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:40,008
As matters stand,
what measures would you propose?

331
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:42,344
Two. The whereabouts
of any treasure maps

332
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:45,973
to be kept strictly secret
from myself and my mate, Mr. Arrow.

333
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:49,059
The firearms removed from
the forward hold and stored aft, here.

334
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:51,979
Surely you don't anticipate mutiny?

335
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:54,189
If I did, I wouldn't put to sea at all.

336
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:56,692
The garrison arrangement's
a sensible precaution.

337
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,318
That's fair enough, Trelawney.

338
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,738
Very well. If it'll get us out to sea.

339
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:02,698
- Agreed then, sir.
- Good.

340
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,825
Now, Captain.

341
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,464
You will find I'll do my duty.

342
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:24,470
Hang it, Livesy.
Why'd you take the fellow's part?

343
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:30,225
Because I think our captain's
a very conscientious man.

344
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,728
I find his conduct un-English.

345
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:37,274
Downright un-English.

346
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:40,027
Weigh anchor, Mr. Arrow.

347
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:42,362
All hands on deck! Man the windlass!

348
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:50,162
Fall the topsail!

349
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,416
Anchors aweigh, sir!

350
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:01,149
Aloft there! Overhaul the buntline!

351
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:08,615
Well, Captain, what do you
say about our crew now?

352
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,285
Oh, they're seamen of sorts, sir.

353
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:15,289
A shade better than Lord Mayor's men,
and no worse than dock-wallopers

354
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:17,332
brought aboard by the press-gang.

355
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:23,630
- Mr. Arrow, brace your foreyard!
- Aye, aye, sir.

356
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,340
Lee fore brace!

357
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:27,718
Avast!

358
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:30,053
Avast!

359
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:36,018
- Mr. Arrow.
- Concealed weapon, sir.

360
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:37,686
Bring that man aft.

361
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:47,237
- What's your name?
- George Merry, sir.

362
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:49,781
I suppose you sailed
with Admiral Hawke, too?

363
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,909
Aye, sir. Master gunner.

364
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:54,119
You brought your own cannon aboard?

365
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:57,623
Men accustomed to warfare
do arm themselves.

366
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:59,875
Not when engaged on peaceful,
commercial enterprise.

367
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:04,129
Any further offense, 12 lashes.

368
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:07,007
And that goes for all the fo'c'sle hands.

369
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,884
- See to it, Mr. Arrow.
- Aye, aye, sir.

370
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:10,510
Dismissed.

371
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,440
I'll have to turn mine in, too.

372
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:25,150
Here.

373
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:27,986
- You ain't let no one see it, have ye?
- No, sir.

374
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:31,365
Then it would go hard with Long John
if you was to turn it in now.

375
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:32,574
But why?

376
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:35,702
Well, here's a captain with a suspicious
turn of mind,

377
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,997
and here's Long John handing
out firearms,

378
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:41,875
to an able-bodied seaman like yourself.

379
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,961
But I'd do no harm with it.

380
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:46,755
- Would you keep it out of sight?
- Yes, sir.

381
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:49,257
You ain't given to rum drinking, are ye?

382
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:51,009
Oh, no, sir.

383
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:55,263
Nor quarrelsome,
like some I could name?

384
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:58,183
I don't want no mate peachin' on me.

385
00:32:58,267 --> 00:32:59,851
You shouldn't have crossed
him, George.

386
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:01,269
Now he can take away our rum ration.

387
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:03,563
- You knows his reputation.
- And drink it all himself.

388
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,607
Why did you give him the
chance, then?

389
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:09,069
You heard the orders.

390
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:12,072
Seamen knives is all, and them
in full sight.

391
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:15,534
Well, Israel Hands,
here's one he don't get.

392
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:25,502
Ain't that a beauty, now.

393
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:32,801
Why, a knife like that'd bring
down a gull.

394
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:42,019
Devil burn ye, John Silver,
and don't think ye come that over me.

395
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:45,814
Time you learn, George Merry,
just who is captain

396
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:49,609
aboard this here
commercial enterprise.

397
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,862
A captain's was a captain
wouldn't have that mate around

398
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:53,780
sticking his nose into fo'c'sle business.

399
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:57,617
You lay a finger on Mr. Arrow,
and you'll answer to me.

400
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,583
Mr. Arrow be a friend
of Long John Silver's

401
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:07,627
and I plans to take care of him.

402
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:10,881
Be that clear, George Merry?

403
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:21,224
You know, matey, if you and me
was worth our salt,

404
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:25,437
we'd think out a way to
sweeten Mr. Arrow's disposition.

405
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:33,737
I knows what'll do him.

406
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:36,865
- Plum duff.
- Oh, my mother made that!

407
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:39,826
Tasted proper on a cold night, didn't it?

408
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:43,163
Did your mother ever put a drop of
rum in it?

409
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:45,707
Good and strong,
so the smell went up your nose.

410
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:48,502
Aye, it's too bad we ain't got none.

411
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:52,047
Plum duff ain't no better
than bilge water without rum.

412
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:53,423
Can't you get rum for cooking?

413
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:56,676
And have Captain suspect me of
sneaking double grog?

414
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:59,054
I could ask Squire for some.

415
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:00,472
Without Captain knowing?

416
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:01,932
I'm sure I could.

417
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:04,184
Blow me down, so ye could.

418
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:07,813
You have an egress and regress
to the gentlemen in the cabin,

419
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:10,816
but, uh, can you keep
that many secrets?

420
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:13,693
Aye, aye, sir.

421
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,737
You're a good 'un, Jim.

422
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:19,241
I seen that from the start.

423
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:52,941
A-yo, ho, ho and a bottle of rum

424
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:04,703
Starboard watch on deck!

425
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:08,498
Starboard watch on deck!

426
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:11,209
Starboard watch on deck!

427
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:19,217
Mr. Arrow?

428
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:23,513
Could ye spare a minute
afore you go topside again?

429
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:36,234
Plum duff. I made it special for you, sir.

430
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,996
And that's what gives it the flavor.

431
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:55,003
Sweeten to suit your taste.

432
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:07,766
Right there, you big monkey.

433
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:45,512
You'll need your sea legs
up there tonight, sir.

434
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:11,413
Have ye forgot, George?

435
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:15,834
I'm the one what's taking care
of Mr. Arrow.

436
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:28,305
And it shall be entered in the log

437
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:32,100
that Mr. Arrow, mate on the Hispaniola

438
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:37,105
was washed overboard in a storm
on the night of May 14,

439
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:41,735
and his body not recovered for burial.

440
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:47,240
Unto Almighty God we commend
the soul of our brother departed

441
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:50,660
and commit his body to the deep.

442
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:52,537
Amen.

443
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:05,050
Do you think we'll ever
sight land again?

444
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:07,135
- We will.
- When?

445
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:09,012
Ooh, there are signs.

446
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:11,056
What signs?

447
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,975
Sailors' vapors, mostly.

448
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:17,395
Crew always gets quarrelsome
towards the end of a voyage

449
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,231
when all the beer's gone
and the water keg's crawling

450
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:24,694
and all you've got left is
salt pork and boiled beans,

451
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:27,322
and boiled beans and salt pork.

452
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:29,449
There's a few apples left.

453
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:32,452
And when the last apple's et,
we'll sight land.

454
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:35,455
- Then I'm going to eat 'em all up.
- Good.

455
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:38,833
- Hey, fetch me one.
- Aye, aye, sir.

456
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:03,400
- What do you think, George?
- We can take this ship right now.

457
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:06,736
- Then what are we waiting for?
- That's what I wants to know.

458
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:09,406
Since me and Norton joined you,
the only crew left

459
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:12,075
on Captain's side
is Gray and Joyce and Hunter.

460
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:14,661
And I say, cut their throats!

461
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:21,167
And I say there'll be no killing
till I give the word.

462
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,377
What's come over you, John?

463
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:24,712
When you were sailing with Flint,
it was cut and rip.

464
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:27,382
John's gone too genteel
for bloodletting.

465
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:29,676
You thickheaded swab!

466
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,929
Who got rid of Arrow so quiet
that no one suspected?

467
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:36,266
Not even young Hawkins,
who brought be the rum for the job.

468
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:39,561
And who'll get ye firearms
in the same way when the time comes?

469
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:42,439
Nobody's crossing you, John,
but we still would like to know

470
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:43,690
what we're waitin' for.

471
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:47,318
We're waiting while a first-class
navigator like Captain Smollett

472
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:51,072
sails this here bumboat
to our destination.

473
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:54,534
We can steer a course,
but who's to set one?

474
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:57,912
You'll get plenty
of cut and rip when the time comes.

475
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:01,332
But until I gives the signal, lay to.

476
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:03,626
Well, we'll wait, but it won't be easy.

477
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:07,255
Well, I want some pickles and wine
and a mouthful of rum, I do.

478
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:09,340
When a thirst is on ye,

479
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:13,261
bite into a pippin real savage.

480
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:15,054
It staves off the desire.

481
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:16,890
Land ho!

482
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:19,767
Land ho!

483
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:36,784
Long John Silver. I just can't believe it.

484
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:39,245
I'd never have questioned his loyalty.

485
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,080
Everything he told us was a lie.

486
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:44,542
I've been a fool, sir.

487
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:47,670
You're not the only one, lad.

488
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:50,715
Captain Smollett, I own myself an ass.

489
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:54,469
- You were right, I was wrong.
- No more wrong than I, Squire.

490
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:56,846
I'm the man that signed
Scully and Norton

491
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:58,973
and they've turned against me.

492
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:03,061
Precious few of us left now.
Counting Joyce, Gray, Hunter,

493
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:05,396
Redruth, Williams,
that makes us eight. Nine.

494
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:07,899
Nine against 20? Pretty heavy odds.

495
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,151
We have all the firearms.
Can't we surprise them?

496
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:13,029
That's my plan when
I get them all ashore.

497
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:15,949
Did Silver give any hint
when he meant to start the mutiny?

498
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:17,367
No, sir.

499
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:19,285
Well, here's my view.
We've got time ahead of us,

500
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,411
at least till we find the treasure.

501
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:22,997
Yes, but can Silver keep
his men in check that long?

502
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:24,958
If he can hold them back for 24 hours,

503
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:28,962
I'll have every one of
the mutinous dogs in irons.

504
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:32,340
Well, here's our course. Lay to,

505
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:35,051
and give them no cause for alarm,
otherwise they'd strike at once.

506
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,803
In the meantime,
we'll arm the faithful hands

507
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:38,596
and keep a sharp lookout for them.

508
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,890
If you hear any murmurs
against Silver, report to me.

509
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:45,228
Jim warned us once.
I wonder if he could do it again.

510
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:46,938
Jim, could you play a part
you don't feel?

511
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:50,441
Keep your ears open,
and stay friends with Silver?

512
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:52,902
Stay friends with him?

513
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:02,370
Yes, sir. I'll stay friends with him.

514
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:14,924
'Tis a sweet spot
for a young lad ashore.

515
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:17,927
You'll climb trees and hunt goats,
you will.

516
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:20,555
And when you've a mind
to do a bit of explorin',

517
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:24,851
just you ask ol' John, and he'll put up
a bit of grub for ye to take along.

518
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:30,481
What's come over ye, lad?
Cat got your tongue?

519
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:33,568
All hands.

520
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:38,448
Any of you seen that land before?

521
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:40,700
I have, sir.

522
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:45,622
I was cook on a trader
that watered here.

523
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:48,916
- Where's the anchorage?
- Yonder, sir, through that inlet.

524
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:51,544
- Can it be entered at low tide?
- Aye.

525
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:54,505
There's a kind of passage
been dug there

526
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:57,550
in a manner of speaking, by nature.

527
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:00,928
You give me a strong pull
with a long boat, sir,

528
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:02,889
and I'll guide her in like a lamb.

529
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:06,100
Good. Stand by to lower the boats.

530
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:20,031
Can I come along in the boat?

531
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:22,825
- Captain Smollett?
- Yes?

532
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:26,704
Young Hawkins here wants
to try his hand on a tiller.

533
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:29,207
Permission granted.

534
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:34,337
Now that we've got here,
what are we waiting for?

535
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:37,423
We're waiting till
I decide the time be right.

536
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:40,385
Be that plain enough, George Merry?

537
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:44,514
Lower away.

538
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:49,394
- You're to have the helm, ain't you?
- Aye.

539
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:54,273
- See Redruth on guard there?
- Aye.

540
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:57,527
When I give ye the signal, jump on him
so's we can rush the aft cabin

541
00:44:57,611 --> 00:44:59,779
and get them muskets.

542
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:05,368
Cast off your forward lines.

543
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:15,169
Stand by to weigh anchor.

544
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:40,111
Five fathoms!

545
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:42,321
Good anchorage here, sir.

546
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:45,867
- Ready to drop anchor.
- Aye, aye, sir.

547
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:25,072
- Rush him!
- Boys, get on deck fast!

548
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:28,534
Belay! Lay to!

549
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:32,121
Get below, you scum. Double quick.

550
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:35,833
Get down. Get down.

551
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:43,925
- Lash down the hatch.
- Now we're for it.

552
00:46:44,009 --> 00:46:47,845
Cast off the lines
and pull for the shore. Lively!

553
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:52,266
None of that, my men. Turn about.
Come alongside.

554
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:57,313
Fire that musket, and I cuts his throat.

555
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:02,193
Merry, you blundering squid.
Can you hear me?

556
00:47:02,277 --> 00:47:04,612
Aye, I hear ye.

557
00:47:04,696 --> 00:47:09,075
Lie low till a treaty be made.
And this time, follow orders.

558
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:12,745
As for you, Mr. Smollett,
I'll give ye one hour

559
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:16,999
to send a boat ashore with Flint's map
and give yourself up to Mr. Merry.

560
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:23,005
So be it if you want to
see young Hawkins alive.

561
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:25,800
Pull for the shore. Lively!

562
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,515
By Jove, sir, we've got to save that boy.

563
00:47:34,142 --> 00:47:37,436
Now then, matey,
don't ye take it so hard.

564
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,772
Why, it is lucky you came along,

565
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:44,193
or old John here, he'd
have had nothing to bargain with.

566
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:47,321
But that don't mean I'd harm
a hair of your little head.

567
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:49,740
Liar! You let go of me.

568
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:54,161
There, now, see? Here, here!
Come back here.

569
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:57,582
- Come here, you.
- After him, you swabs.

570
00:47:57,666 --> 00:48:00,835
Come on! Go on! Go on!

571
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:25,860
Come on! There he goes.

572
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:33,868
After him! After him!

573
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:40,875
- Which way, Scully?
- Pipe down. I thought I heard him.

574
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:49,467
A hang good job of sighting you did.

575
00:48:49,551 --> 00:48:52,595
Ah, he must have
doubled back. Beat to the woods, mates.

576
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:54,889
After him!

577
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:16,035
No, no, no! Don't shoot!

578
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:18,371
You wouldn't harm Ben Gunn?

579
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:22,917
Poor Ben Gunn, I am.
And I haven't spoke with a Christian

580
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:25,461
these five years.

581
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:28,297
Five years! Were you shipwrecked?

582
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:31,384
Nay, mate. Marooned.

583
00:49:32,594 --> 00:49:36,889
Tell me, mate, would that be
Flint's ship?

584
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:39,850
No, Flint's dead.
The master of that ship's

585
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:41,936
a gentleman, Captain Smollett.

586
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:46,565
"Gentleman," says you.
"Flint's men," says I.

587
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:48,317
I've seen 'em.

588
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:51,862
Some of them are Flint's men,
but they got aboard by a trick.

589
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:55,825
Is there a man with one leg among 'em?

590
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:58,744
- Long John Silver.
- Nay, if you were sent by him

591
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:00,955
I'm as good as pork, and I knows it.

592
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:03,541
No, you don't understand.

593
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:07,169
He's trying to take me as hostage.
I hate John Silver.

594
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:11,924
"And fear him, too," says you.
Everybody feared Flint's quartermaster.

595
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:15,011
It was him has marooned me here.

596
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:20,516
I ain't had a mouthful of Christian diet
these five years.

597
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:24,103
Marooned five years!

598
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:27,523
And lived on goats and berries.

599
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:30,860
Many is the night

600
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:34,488
I dreamed of cheese.

601
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:36,449
Toasted, mostly.

602
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:39,535
You wouldn't have a rind of cheese
about you, would you, now?

603
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:41,954
There's cheese by the hundredweight
aboard ship.

604
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:43,873
Now, if you could
help me row a long boat...

605
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:47,752
"Boat," says you.
"Ben Gunn's your man," says I.

606
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:50,463
What might ye call yourself, mate?

607
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:52,590
- Jim.
- Jim.

608
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:55,843
Jim. Well, now, Jim,

609
00:50:55,927 --> 00:50:58,804
you just follow Ben Gunn.

610
00:51:04,811 --> 00:51:07,480
A little more west, sir.

611
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:11,192
There it is.

612
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:15,529
With that stockade as a base
for our operations ashore

613
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:18,657
we stand a better chance
of rescuing that boy.

614
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:25,289
That's all.

615
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:31,212
Keep a sharp watch,
one stem, the other stern.

616
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:32,588
You'll be relieved in good time.

617
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:35,007
Let us out of here, you dogs!

618
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:38,302
Don't be afraid of those bilge rats,

619
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:40,638
but don't underestimate them either.

620
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:45,434
Shove off.

621
00:51:50,982 --> 00:51:56,362
Made it with me own hands
out of bamboo and goatskins, mostly.

622
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:59,532
"And a trim little craft," says you.

623
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:02,785
- Will she hold us both?
- That she will.

624
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:08,541
"But first," says you, "we'll see if
the coast is clear of Flint's men."

625
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:16,549
No sign of 'em.

626
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:21,011
Look! The jolly boat!
They're coming for me!

627
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:32,314
Let us out of here, you dogs!

628
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:35,985
Open up, you swab!

629
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:40,865
Let us out of here!

630
00:52:44,035 --> 00:52:46,495
Open the hatches!

631
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:50,749
Come on. Let us out of prison!

632
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:54,378
Stop that, or I fires.

633
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:58,799
Break! Break!

634
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:04,889
Pull, boys. Pull for the shore.

635
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:08,058
Stop that!

636
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:12,563
Blast away!

637
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,858
Blasted!

638
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:37,421
Aye! Ahoy there.

639
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:40,007
Now we'll all be marooned.

640
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:54,271
Aye, we can give that captain
a proper welcome ashore.

641
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:58,776
Avast. Pay no heed to them. Make
for the ship. We want them muskets.

642
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:04,657
- Captain...
- No, no, matey.

643
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:08,369
- Do you want John Silver to hear us?
- But Captain won't know where I went.

644
00:54:08,453 --> 00:54:14,250
No need to. Ben Gunn knows
where your captain's headed for.

645
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:21,548
There be your friends, sure enough.

646
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:26,720
Come on. Come along.

647
00:54:26,846 --> 00:54:30,182
If your captain wants to see Ben Gunn,

648
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:32,768
tell him to come tonight, alone,

649
00:54:32,852 --> 00:54:35,771
to the top of Spy Glass Hill.

650
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:37,273
I'll tell him.

651
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:43,654
And tell him them as hides can find,
and them as finds can hide!

652
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:49,368
Yo, ho, ho
and a bottle of rum

653
00:54:49,744 --> 00:54:52,079
Give me the full one, George.

654
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:58,419
Yo, ho, ho and a bottle of rum

655
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:04,675
Changed your quarters,
have ye, George?

656
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:07,469
Aye. I took the ship for you, didn't I?

657
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:10,848
- I can't remember asking ye.
- You said when the time was right.

658
00:55:11,891 --> 00:55:14,560
Clap him in irons.

659
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:17,229
Clap him in irons!

660
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:19,940
I'll carry out your orders, John,
but I'm speakin' in open council

661
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:23,277
for you to give George Merry
another chance.

662
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:26,238
George here ain't the one
to lay plans, but if you aims

663
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:29,408
to take this stockade,

664
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:32,619
well, George is a good man in a fight.

665
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:35,497
Too good to be rotting down below.

666
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:37,583
- That's right, John.
- That's right, John.

667
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:41,045
That's very civil spoke, Israel Hands.

668
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:44,214
And now we'll put it to Mr. Merry,

669
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:47,468
if I'm to take any more of his sauce.

670
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:54,350
- I'm with ya, Captain.
- Aye, aye, Captain.

671
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:58,437
All right, then.
If I'm captain, then this is orders.

672
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:02,608
All hands ashore
except Israel and Haggott here.

673
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:05,069
The two of you remain on board
and guard the ship.

674
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:06,236
Aye, aye, sir.

675
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:09,281
If you're in trouble, you can signal me
by firing the cannon.

676
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:13,952
- Aye, aye, sir.
- And when you're doing sentry, though,

677
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:16,789
just ease off a point on the rum.

678
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:20,334
Hear that, Haggott?

679
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:33,764
Now, which is it, drink or fight?

680
00:56:33,848 --> 00:56:36,475
Fight! Fight!

681
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:44,858
Then would you say, Jim, from what
you saw of this Ben Gunn, is he sane?

682
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:49,696
Well, yes, I shouldn't wonder.

683
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:52,533
A man who's been biting his nails
for years on a desert island

684
00:56:52,617 --> 00:56:55,119
can't be expected to appear
as sane as you or I.

685
00:56:55,203 --> 00:56:57,579
Why did he want you
to come after dark, Captain?

686
00:56:57,664 --> 00:57:00,582
Safety, of course. But frankly,
I've no craving for his company.

687
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:04,420
If he knows as much about the island as
he says he does, I may pay him a visit.

688
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:08,340
Later, perhaps. Right now,
we may expect visitors ourselves.

689
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:10,551
- Can you load, Jim Hawkins?
- Yes, sir.

690
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:13,387
Good. When they come,
we must have their rations ready.

691
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:17,099
Let them come, by Jove.
They'll find me ready.

692
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:19,351
Once I've had my brandy.

693
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:24,106
Quarters!

694
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:26,859
Flag of truce!

695
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:30,362
Hold your positions.
I'll go and have a look.

696
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:32,906
Flag of truce!

697
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:36,910
What do you want
with your flag of truce?

698
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:40,080
Captain Silver to come aboard
and make terms.

699
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:43,041
Captain Silver? Who's he?

700
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:46,545
Me, sir. These poor lads here

701
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:50,716
have chosen me captain
after your desertion, sir.

702
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:54,761
My man, I've got no desire
to talk to you.

703
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:57,723
But if you want to talk to me,
you can come aboard.

704
00:57:57,849 --> 00:58:00,893
There'll be no treachery,
unless it's on your side.

705
00:58:00,935 --> 00:58:05,898
The word of a gentleman
be good enough for Long John.

706
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:14,990
It may be a trick.
Gray, Joyce, Hunter, keep stations!

707
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:27,002
That's far enough. Sit down.

708
00:58:27,086 --> 00:58:32,049
Very well, sir, but one of you'll
have to give me a leg up again.

709
00:58:34,385 --> 00:58:37,930
A sweet, pretty place
you have here, to be sure.

710
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:41,767
And there's Jim.
How be my little matey?

711
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:44,019
And Squire and Doctor.

712
00:58:44,103 --> 00:58:46,271
My service to ye, gentlemen.

713
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:48,524
If you've anything to say,
you'd better say it.

714
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:51,944
You're right, Captain.
Well, the long and the short of it be this.

715
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:57,074
I want Flint's map, and I can
risk half my crew to get it.

716
00:58:57,116 --> 00:58:59,701
But that ain't Captain Silver's way.

717
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:02,788
"Try reasoning first," says I.

718
00:59:02,914 --> 00:59:07,376
I never was one to see poor
seamen shot down needless like.

719
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:10,754
You are not in Parliament yet,
John Silver. Come to the point.

720
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:14,716
You're a good man, Doctor.
I've never seen a better.

721
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:20,097
And I'd hate to see the likes of you
skewered on the end of a pike.

722
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:22,975
So here be my terms.

723
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:27,771
You give us that there map and you
can stay here and keep your lives.

724
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:30,816
We'll divide stores with ye, man to man,

725
00:59:30,942 --> 00:59:35,821
and I gives you my affidavit
to stop the first ship I sight

726
00:59:35,947 --> 00:59:37,990
and send 'em here to pick you up.

727
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:42,494
- Your word, Silver?
- Handsomer you couldn't ask.

728
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:46,832
And I hopes all gentlemen present
will over all my words,

729
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:50,252
for what be said to one be said to all.

730
00:59:50,336 --> 00:59:55,007
- Is that all?
- Every last word, by thunder!

731
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:58,594
Very good. Now hear my terms.

732
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:02,347
If you come up here,
one by one, unarmed,

733
01:00:02,473 --> 01:00:04,683
I'll engage to clap you all in irons

734
01:00:04,809 --> 01:00:07,352
and take you home
to a fair trial in England.

735
01:00:07,478 --> 01:00:10,480
You can't find the treasure.
You can't sail a ship.

736
01:00:10,523 --> 01:00:14,943
And your cowardly scum can't fight.
Now, bundle out of here, double quick.

737
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:17,112
- Give me a hand up, will ye?
- Not I.

738
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:20,866
Who'll give me a hand, I say.

739
01:00:25,663 --> 01:00:28,540
So be it!

740
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:31,293
But 'fore an hour's out,

741
01:00:31,377 --> 01:00:34,504
you'll be begging help from me.

742
01:00:34,547 --> 01:00:38,550
Them that die'll be the lucky ones!

743
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:53,357
Truce be over!

744
01:00:53,399 --> 01:00:55,901
Cutlasses, you swabs!

745
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:57,569
They've opened fire here from the east.

746
01:00:57,695 --> 01:00:59,363
They'll board from all sides at once.

747
01:00:59,405 --> 01:01:02,157
Slash them down!

748
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:16,213
Burn 'em, boys, burn 'em!
Burn 'em, you swabs.

749
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:24,930
Aah!

750
01:01:26,224 --> 01:01:28,266
Musket.

751
01:01:50,748 --> 01:01:53,250
Out, lads. Fight in the open.

752
01:01:53,292 --> 01:01:56,044
Keep those muskets loaded. Here.

753
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:07,889
Cut that captain down!

754
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:09,576
They're on the run.
Take cover before they reload.

755
01:03:13,164 --> 01:03:15,916
Come back here, you lubberly Turks.

756
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,127
Oh, for 10 toes!

757
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:35,101
- Quick, Doctor!
- Bar the door.

758
01:03:37,563 --> 01:03:40,023
Jim, my case. My case.

759
01:04:02,421 --> 01:04:05,173
Think they'll attack again?

760
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:09,678
I don't know, Jim.
It's hard to foresee the end of this.

761
01:04:09,762 --> 01:04:12,430
Jim, take this map. I want you to have it.

762
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:15,350
Just a precaution.
It's yours by right, you know.

763
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:17,853
And if the worst comes to the worst,

764
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:21,314
don't hesitate to buy your life with it.

765
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:25,360
Water.

766
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:50,427
How many of them fell?

767
01:04:50,511 --> 01:04:52,178
Five or six at least,
that I know of.

768
01:04:52,263 --> 01:04:55,974
Better odds now. They won't
drive us out of here in a hurry.

769
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:58,894
- They may not try to.
- Why not?

770
01:05:00,187 --> 01:05:03,064
At flood tide tomorrow,
nothing's to hinder them

771
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:06,192
from bringing the ship close in shore.

772
01:05:06,277 --> 01:05:08,904
Once within cannon range,
they could level this fort.

773
01:05:08,988 --> 01:05:12,198
- By Jove, I hadn't thought of that.
- Will they think of it?

774
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:15,869
Silver might, blast him!

775
01:05:15,953 --> 01:05:19,247
They've got all the boats.
Otherwise, we could slip out,

776
01:05:19,332 --> 01:05:22,459
cut the hawser,
and the ship might beach herself.

777
01:05:22,543 --> 01:05:25,211
- I could swim for it, sir.
- Can't spare you.

778
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:30,258
Just nuisance firing, that's all.

779
01:06:38,119 --> 01:06:40,286
You heard what he said!

780
01:06:40,371 --> 01:06:43,373
Ease off a point on the rum!

781
01:06:55,261 --> 01:06:57,637
- No, you don't.
- But I want my ration

782
01:06:57,722 --> 01:07:00,348
and none of your sour looks neither.

783
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:02,851
Stand clear of that rum.

784
01:07:02,935 --> 01:07:06,062
You'll get no more till we're relieved.
And if you don't keep off it,

785
01:07:06,147 --> 01:07:08,732
I'll fire that cannon
and get a proper watch aboard.

786
01:07:08,816 --> 01:07:11,192
- Oh, will ya?
- Yeah!

787
01:09:00,344 --> 01:09:03,054
So it was you had Flint's map.

788
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:37,315
- Not another step.
- Jim.

789
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:41,069
Jim.

790
01:10:41,153 --> 01:10:44,113
I reckon I'll have to strike my colors.

791
01:10:45,532 --> 01:10:49,535
That comes hard
from a master mariner to a...

792
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:53,248
To a ship's younker like you, Jim.

793
01:10:55,668 --> 01:10:58,795
But you're like Silver said,

794
01:10:58,879 --> 01:11:01,506
smart as paint.

795
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:05,385
One more step, Mr. Hands,
and I'll blow your brains out.

796
01:11:05,469 --> 01:11:07,762
Now, now, matey.

797
01:11:13,310 --> 01:11:16,187
Matey.

798
01:14:44,855 --> 01:14:47,064
Dr. Livesy?

799
01:14:51,236 --> 01:14:53,696
Dr. Livesy.

800
01:14:57,868 --> 01:14:59,994
Doctor?

801
01:15:04,041 --> 01:15:05,374
Matey.

802
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:23,392
Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight!

803
01:15:23,477 --> 01:15:26,312
Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight!

804
01:15:29,483 --> 01:15:33,319
- Pipe down!
- Aye, 'tis the cabin boy.

805
01:15:33,403 --> 01:15:35,988
Someone's pinked him, for certain.

806
01:15:36,073 --> 01:15:38,407
Blood poisoning, I shouldn't doubt.

807
01:15:38,492 --> 01:15:40,993
Save me cutting your throat,
you little swab.

808
01:15:41,078 --> 01:15:45,248
- Avast, George Merry.
- Avast, is it?

809
01:15:45,332 --> 01:15:47,416
Little matey, is it?

810
01:15:47,501 --> 01:15:51,712
Maybe a touch of this here would show
Master Hawkins which side he were on.

811
01:15:51,797 --> 01:15:54,549
And some others I could name.

812
01:15:54,633 --> 01:15:58,302
Maybe you thought
you was captain here.

813
01:15:58,387 --> 01:16:00,930
Fetch the water bucket!

814
01:16:06,436 --> 01:16:10,147
I don't have to be captain
to know my rights.

815
01:16:10,232 --> 01:16:13,526
And askin' your pardon, this here crew
would lay a sight more confidence

816
01:16:13,610 --> 01:16:16,862
in a captain as allowed us our say
about enemy prisoners.

817
01:16:16,947 --> 01:16:19,865
Prisoners be one thing,
hostages another.

818
01:16:19,950 --> 01:16:21,909
We has the ship. We has the fort.

819
01:16:21,994 --> 01:16:24,203
What good is a hostage,
and him bad hurt?

820
01:16:24,288 --> 01:16:26,289
Why, you knot head.

821
01:16:26,373 --> 01:16:30,668
With him bad hurt, they'll part
with the map to save his life.

822
01:16:30,752 --> 01:16:34,714
We'll hoist the flag of truce
and hail that doctor.

823
01:16:36,049 --> 01:16:39,176
Or would any man jack of ye

824
01:16:39,261 --> 01:16:43,222
care to give me
an argument to the contrary?

825
01:16:43,307 --> 01:16:45,641
So that's your sort, is it?

826
01:16:45,892 --> 01:16:48,561
You're great hands to talk, you are.

827
01:16:48,645 --> 01:16:51,772
But when it comes to fightin',
that boy there

828
01:16:51,857 --> 01:16:54,567
be a better man than any two of you.

829
01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:05,745
Before this crew takes anymore orders
from you, Long John,

830
01:17:05,829 --> 01:17:08,247
we claims our rights
to step outside for a council.

831
01:17:08,332 --> 01:17:10,833
- According to rules.
- Let's go, council.

832
01:17:27,934 --> 01:17:31,771
You! What are you doing here?
Doctor? Squire?

833
01:17:31,855 --> 01:17:34,690
They gave us the slip last night, matey.

834
01:17:34,775 --> 01:17:37,735
When we walked in here,
they was gone.

835
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:42,406
Now you lay still.
You're going to be cared for proper.

836
01:17:42,491 --> 01:17:46,118
Old John will fetch that doctor here.

837
01:18:29,996 --> 01:18:32,748
Flag of truce!

838
01:18:32,833 --> 01:18:35,209
Ahoy!

839
01:18:35,293 --> 01:18:38,421
Doctor?

840
01:18:38,505 --> 01:18:41,173
We have Jim Hawkins!

841
01:18:42,509 --> 01:18:45,302
Ahoy!

842
01:18:45,387 --> 01:18:47,513
Doctor!

843
01:18:47,597 --> 01:18:49,682
Ahoy!

844
01:19:03,572 --> 01:19:07,241
Step up, lad. I won't
hurt no member of a deputation.

845
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:14,331
The black spot!
Well, shiver my timbers.

846
01:19:15,667 --> 01:19:20,087
What be this?
This here was cut from a Bible.

847
01:19:20,172 --> 01:19:23,007
- What fools cut a Bible?
- What did I say?

848
01:19:23,091 --> 01:19:27,344
- "No good'll come of that," I said.
- Was it you, Job Anderson?

849
01:19:28,221 --> 01:19:30,848
Now Job can say his prayers.

850
01:19:30,932 --> 01:19:33,934
He's had his slice of luck, Job has.

851
01:19:34,019 --> 01:19:38,731
- Cut a Bible! You'll all swing now.
- Belay that talk, John Silver.

852
01:19:38,815 --> 01:19:42,026
This crew has tipped you
the black spot in full council.

853
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:45,154
The rules is, you turn it over in
duty bound, and see what's wrote there.

854
01:19:45,238 --> 01:19:50,242
Thank ye, George.
You always was brisk for business.

855
01:19:50,327 --> 01:19:53,496
"Deposed." And very pretty wrote.

856
01:19:53,580 --> 01:19:56,499
Your handwriting, George?

857
01:19:57,250 --> 01:20:00,461
You're getting quite a leading hand
in this here crew.

858
01:20:01,004 --> 01:20:03,339
You'll be captain next,
I shouldn't wonder.

859
01:20:03,423 --> 01:20:06,133
You can't fool
this crew no more, John Silver.

860
01:20:06,218 --> 01:20:09,220
Step down off your perch and vote.

861
01:20:09,304 --> 01:20:11,889
John Silver!

862
01:20:14,976 --> 01:20:18,979
There'll be no voting till the business
of this here map be disposed of.

863
01:20:19,064 --> 01:20:23,901
Till then I'm still captain, and
your black spot ain't worth a biscuit.

864
01:20:23,985 --> 01:20:26,111
Map or no map, we ain't
givin' up no hostage

865
01:20:26,196 --> 01:20:28,030
till we lays hands on the treasure itself.
Am I right, mates?

866
01:20:29,241 --> 01:20:32,535
How ye going to find that
treasure without the map?

867
01:20:32,619 --> 01:20:35,204
Silver!

868
01:20:40,001 --> 01:20:43,921
- John Silver!
- Top o' the morning, Doctor.

869
01:20:44,005 --> 01:20:47,550
Will ye come aboard and take a look
at young Hawkins' wound?

870
01:20:47,634 --> 01:20:50,135
No more of your tricks, Silver.

871
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:53,764
If Jim Hawkins is there, bring him out.

872
01:20:58,687 --> 01:21:01,730
You want to see that doctor,
don't ye, Jim?

873
01:21:05,694 --> 01:21:08,070
If I take ye as far as the stockade,

874
01:21:08,154 --> 01:21:11,866
will you give me your affidavit
not to slip your cable?

875
01:21:11,950 --> 01:21:13,492
- Word of honor?
- Word of honor.

876
01:21:13,577 --> 01:21:14,702
Right, then.

877
01:21:14,786 --> 01:21:17,371
Stand by here while I parleys with him.

878
01:21:17,455 --> 01:21:21,292
And keep a sharp lookout on all sides.

879
01:21:21,376 --> 01:21:23,460
I'll keep a weather eye
out for a man what's trying

880
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:27,089
to get a foot in each camp,
and he with only one leg.

881
01:21:27,173 --> 01:21:32,803
You'd better come back with that map
and the hostage, Captain Silver!

882
01:21:34,556 --> 01:21:36,765
Doctor!

883
01:21:40,687 --> 01:21:42,688
Steady, lad. Steady, Jim.

884
01:21:42,772 --> 01:21:44,940
Aye, he's had a rum go of it, sir.

885
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:51,447
- Taking to knifing boys, eh, Silver?
- Not me, sir.

886
01:21:51,531 --> 01:21:55,326
Why, if it hadn't been for Long John,
he'd have had his throat cut.

887
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:58,704
Bite hard on that bullet, Jim.
This will have to be opened.

888
01:22:04,836 --> 01:22:09,840
You could cut my good leg off 'fore I'd
raise a finger against that there lad.

889
01:22:09,925 --> 01:22:15,095
Why, when he comes crawling into
the fort half dead, I says to myself,

890
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:18,724
"You've got to save
that dear boy, John."

891
01:22:18,808 --> 01:22:22,144
Captain would wish it,
Squire would wish it and you'd wish it.

892
01:22:22,228 --> 01:22:25,147
So Captain Silver is minded
to join us again, eh?

893
01:22:25,231 --> 01:22:29,068
I'll be honest and open with you,
as I always am.

894
01:22:29,152 --> 01:22:32,363
When I climbed the fort
and seen the Hispaniola

895
01:22:32,447 --> 01:22:36,700
flying that Union Jack,
I knew I'd been taught a lesson

896
01:22:36,785 --> 01:22:39,745
by my betters.

897
01:22:42,874 --> 01:22:45,542
I thinks gold dust of this dear boy.

898
01:22:45,627 --> 01:22:47,628
I've took to him like pitch.

899
01:22:47,712 --> 01:22:50,839
You'd have killed me yourself
if you'd had that map.

900
01:22:50,924 --> 01:22:55,052
But you'll not get it. I'd die first.

901
01:22:55,136 --> 01:22:58,389
You're a mite late to talk of dying.

902
01:22:58,473 --> 01:23:02,101
No, old John, he ain't human, he ain't.

903
01:23:02,185 --> 01:23:05,938
He didn't care about
saving his little matey's life, not him.

904
01:23:06,022 --> 01:23:10,025
- All he wanted was this here map.
- Very well. You have the map.

905
01:23:10,110 --> 01:23:12,111
But what good is the treasure
without a ship to haul it?

906
01:23:12,195 --> 01:23:16,407
And what good be a ship if 'tis
only to haul me to execution, Doc?

907
01:23:16,491 --> 01:23:18,409
I be no coward, Doctor,

908
01:23:18,493 --> 01:23:21,620
but the thought of them there gallows
gives me the shakes.

909
01:23:21,705 --> 01:23:24,331
Now, if I was to
save young Hawkins' life,

910
01:23:24,416 --> 01:23:27,292
do ye think ye could
save mine into the bargain?

911
01:23:27,377 --> 01:23:29,962
- You save him?
- I could guard the boy

912
01:23:30,046 --> 01:23:33,257
while I plays at treasure hunting
with them scum.

913
01:23:33,341 --> 01:23:36,844
But they'll not give him up
till they sees the treasure dug.

914
01:23:36,928 --> 01:23:39,722
Now, wouldn't that
warrant a good word to the captain?

915
01:23:39,806 --> 01:23:41,932
- I want to speak with the boy alone.
- Speak and welcome,

916
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:46,729
and make a note of that, too, but go
on with your doctoring while you talks.

917
01:23:46,813 --> 01:23:49,523
One false move, and they'll fire.

918
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:01,368
Jim, I don't know how you
managed to save us that ship.

919
01:24:01,453 --> 01:24:03,662
- But I lost the map.
- The map's not important to us now,

920
01:24:03,747 --> 01:24:05,205
but your safety is.

921
01:24:05,290 --> 01:24:07,499
So you're not going back
to those fellows. Now, listen carefully.

922
01:24:07,584 --> 01:24:11,045
I'll make a quick break to draw their fire.
The moment I do, you fall flat.

923
01:24:11,129 --> 01:24:12,212
Then before they've time to reload,

924
01:24:12,297 --> 01:24:14,381
you're up and running and
we both head for the woods. Right?

925
01:24:14,466 --> 01:24:16,091
- I can't!
- Why not?

926
01:24:16,176 --> 01:24:17,885
I gave Long John my word.

927
01:24:17,969 --> 01:24:21,680
They'd have killed me
if it hadn't been for him.

928
01:24:23,641 --> 01:24:26,351
Perhaps you're right, Jim.

929
01:24:26,436 --> 01:24:28,437
Silver!

930
01:24:34,319 --> 01:24:36,695
I want to give you one piece of advice.

931
01:24:36,780 --> 01:24:40,157
Stay close to that boy,
and this I promise you,

932
01:24:40,241 --> 01:24:42,451
if we get out of this wolf trap alive,

933
01:24:42,535 --> 01:24:44,995
I'll do my best to save you,
short of perjury.

934
01:24:45,413 --> 01:24:48,415
You couldn't say more,
not if you was my mother.

935
01:24:48,917 --> 01:24:52,461
Heaven forbid! Good luck, Jim.

936
01:25:10,271 --> 01:25:12,564
- It's the map!
- By Jove, he's got it!

937
01:25:12,649 --> 01:25:15,901
And now, by thunder, I resign.

938
01:25:15,985 --> 01:25:19,029
Elect anyone you please
to be your captain.

939
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:21,198
I've done with ye.

940
01:25:21,282 --> 01:25:24,868
- No, no!
- John Silver for me, yeah!

941
01:25:27,455 --> 01:25:30,415
Take it back, George Merry,
and tear it up.

942
01:25:34,045 --> 01:25:36,672
Put it back in the good book, mate.

943
01:25:36,756 --> 01:25:40,217
Poor roving seamen, the likes of you

944
01:25:40,301 --> 01:25:44,346
needs every scrap
of scripture he can get.

945
01:25:50,645 --> 01:25:53,272
Mind what I say,
Master Hawkins

946
01:25:53,356 --> 01:25:56,316
and don't try to fly the coop again.

947
01:25:59,070 --> 01:26:01,989
Appearances, matey, appearances.

948
01:26:02,073 --> 01:26:05,617
March now, you little spritsail.

949
01:26:05,702 --> 01:26:09,788
To Finger Trunk Tree
by Devil's Rock

950
01:26:09,873 --> 01:26:12,749
bearing a point to the north
of north-northeast.

951
01:26:20,049 --> 01:26:22,718
There she be!

952
01:26:23,469 --> 01:26:24,761
Come on!

953
01:26:41,946 --> 01:26:46,033
Hey! Now, who might that be?

954
01:26:46,117 --> 01:26:48,535
He were a seaman, all right.

955
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:50,829
- Leastways, this be good sea cloth.
- Like enough.

956
01:26:50,914 --> 01:26:52,956
You wouldn't look to find a bishop here.

957
01:26:53,041 --> 01:26:55,751
- What did he die of, I want to know?
- He died of Flint's hand,

958
01:26:55,835 --> 01:26:58,670
as did five other men Flint took ashore.

959
01:26:59,214 --> 01:27:01,215
That would be Darby McGraw.

960
01:27:01,299 --> 01:27:03,634
- Mind old Darby, Morgan?
- Aye, I mind him.

961
01:27:03,718 --> 01:27:05,010
Owed me money, he did.

962
01:27:05,094 --> 01:27:08,222
I don't like the way he's stretched out.
Ain't natural. Ain't nice.

963
01:27:08,306 --> 01:27:11,642
I've a notion. Where's that map?

964
01:27:12,977 --> 01:27:15,812
As I thought. Right in line!

965
01:27:15,897 --> 01:27:20,150
By thunder! It makes me go
cold inside to think of Flint.

966
01:27:20,235 --> 01:27:24,363
This one he hauled here
and laid down by compass

967
01:27:24,447 --> 01:27:28,283
to point the way to the doubloons.

968
01:27:28,368 --> 01:27:30,869
Fetch ahead now!

969
01:27:45,927 --> 01:27:47,135
There it is!

970
01:28:02,277 --> 01:28:04,278
Where is it?

971
01:28:04,362 --> 01:28:05,737
It's gone!

972
01:28:06,406 --> 01:28:08,865
Gone? Dig!

973
01:28:09,117 --> 01:28:11,827
Rip it up, you swabs!

974
01:28:20,545 --> 01:28:22,045
Stand by for trouble.

975
01:28:30,305 --> 01:28:33,765
One dirty guinea!
There's your Â£700,000!

976
01:28:33,850 --> 01:28:37,144
Hardly worth dividing, is it, George?

977
01:28:37,228 --> 01:28:39,813
So you did make
a bargain with the doctor!

978
01:28:39,897 --> 01:28:42,816
Look at his face, mates!
You can see it wrote on his face!

979
01:28:43,026 --> 01:28:45,068
Be you standing for captain again?

980
01:29:00,793 --> 01:29:01,835
Aah!

981
01:29:07,675 --> 01:29:11,136
- Dr. Livesy!
- Jim, are you all right?

982
01:29:11,220 --> 01:29:14,348
Thank ye kindly, Doctor.
You came in the nick of time

983
01:29:14,432 --> 01:29:17,100
for Hawkins and...

984
01:29:17,185 --> 01:29:18,769
Ben Gunn.

985
01:29:18,853 --> 01:29:24,358
How do, Mr. Silver? "Pretty well,
I thank ye," says you.

986
01:29:24,442 --> 01:29:28,070
Ben, to think 'twas you that done me.

987
01:29:28,154 --> 01:29:32,282
"What happened to Flint's gold?"
says you.

988
01:29:32,367 --> 01:29:36,453
"Ben Gunn's cave," says I.

989
01:29:40,333 --> 01:29:44,419
Them as hides can find, Mr. Silver.

990
01:29:44,504 --> 01:29:50,175
"But not when them that finds
has hid it," says I.

991
01:30:02,188 --> 01:30:05,982
John Silver! Now what have you
got to say for yourself?

992
01:30:08,903 --> 01:30:11,822
Well, sir, by your leave, sir,

993
01:30:11,906 --> 01:30:14,241
John Silver's come back to do his duty.

994
01:30:14,325 --> 01:30:15,409
Hmm.

995
01:30:15,493 --> 01:30:17,994
And happy I am to think, sir,

996
01:30:18,079 --> 01:30:23,208
that I had some small hand in
saving young Master Hawkins

997
01:30:23,292 --> 01:30:25,502
when he was within
half a plank of death.

998
01:30:25,837 --> 01:30:29,256
And does that clear you
of the crime of mutiny?

999
01:30:30,425 --> 01:30:32,634
Please, sir, he did save my life.

1000
01:30:32,718 --> 01:30:34,886
Jim's right.
Silver kept his side of the bargain.

1001
01:30:35,221 --> 01:30:38,140
Then you're both free
to testify on his behalf.

1002
01:30:38,433 --> 01:30:40,976
He'll have a fair trial in England.

1003
01:30:41,060 --> 01:30:44,938
Squire Trelawney, while the doctor's
helping me down to the beach,

1004
01:30:45,022 --> 01:30:48,275
I suggest you get a load
aboard the ship.

1005
01:30:48,359 --> 01:30:51,361
Take John Silver along
and put him in irons.

1006
01:30:51,446 --> 01:30:53,447
Aye, aye, sir.

1007
01:30:58,202 --> 01:31:01,246
Now, then, Silver,
none of your monkeyshines.

1008
01:31:07,170 --> 01:31:11,673
Jim, lad, would ye do a favor
for your old shipmate?

1009
01:31:11,757 --> 01:31:16,845
Would ye take Captain Flint?
I've tried caging her before,

1010
01:31:16,929 --> 01:31:21,433
but this old bird,
she can't abide a prison.

1011
01:31:21,517 --> 01:31:24,102
There ain't much in nature as can.

1012
01:31:28,149 --> 01:31:30,984
I couldn't, Long John. I'd like it,

1013
01:31:31,068 --> 01:31:33,570
but I fear she'd just remind me...

1014
01:31:33,654 --> 01:31:36,323
Well, no matter, though I'd dearly love

1015
01:31:36,407 --> 01:31:40,160
to leave you a trinket to a lad I respect.

1016
01:31:40,244 --> 01:31:42,829
All right, Silver,
enough of that.

1017
01:31:51,547 --> 01:31:54,799
Beggin' your pardon, Squire,
you should caulk her

1018
01:31:54,884 --> 01:31:57,010
while she's heeled over.

1019
01:32:06,938 --> 01:32:09,648
Jump now, and swim for it.

1020
01:32:09,732 --> 01:32:12,567
And you, too, Squire.

1021
01:32:12,652 --> 01:32:15,654
Why, if you think that you...

1022
01:32:15,738 --> 01:32:17,739
If I may make so bold, sir,

1023
01:32:17,823 --> 01:32:21,076
I'll borrow your boat,
but I ain't takin' you to Jamaica.

1024
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:24,412
- Lively, now!
- You monster!

1025
01:32:28,751 --> 01:32:31,253
Heads up!
I can't swim so far!

1026
01:32:31,337 --> 01:32:33,922
My service to you, Squire.

1027
01:32:34,006 --> 01:32:37,384
Might be as you care to float.

1028
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:44,766
Belay!

1029
01:32:46,143 --> 01:32:49,104
You steer me a true course
through the channel

1030
01:32:49,188 --> 01:32:52,607
and I'll put ye off on yon spit of land.

1031
01:33:11,419 --> 01:33:14,796
Hey! Hey there, avast!

1032
01:33:16,757 --> 01:33:19,301
- Shove me off!
- I'll take no orders from you.

1033
01:33:19,552 --> 01:33:22,137
You put me on here.
Now you'll shove me off

1034
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:26,558
or by the powers,
you'll get what I gave George Merry.

1035
01:33:41,616 --> 01:33:44,909
- Hurry, Livesy!
- Coming, Squire.

1036
01:33:55,713 --> 01:33:58,214
Shoulder to it, Jim.

1037
01:34:00,009 --> 01:34:03,928
That's it!

1038
01:34:04,013 --> 01:34:06,806
Shove her nose out.

1039
01:34:14,899 --> 01:34:17,901
Thank ye, Jim. I might have known

1040
01:34:17,985 --> 01:34:21,404
you'd never let 'em
hang your old shipmate.

1041
01:34:21,489 --> 01:34:25,450
Pull out. Pull back. Overhaul him.

1042
01:34:25,534 --> 01:34:27,786
Harder.

1043
01:34:40,049 --> 01:34:43,343
Ah, well, the sharks may do for him yet.

1044
01:34:50,643 --> 01:34:55,188
Goodbye, matey!
Good luck to ye!

1045
01:34:56,607 --> 01:35:01,778
Blast him. I could almost find it
in my heart to hope he makes it.
