1
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:18,664
Sir, shoals on every side.

2
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:20,707
Sand or reef, I cannot say.

3
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:26,542
Captain, the Malay pirates have
us cornered.

4
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:28,051
We must surrender.

5
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:32,146
Surrendering my father's ship...

6
00:01:32,246 --> 00:01:35,179
will not guarantee survival,
Mr. Phelps.

7
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,691
Shallow water.

8
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:46,865
Dead ahead, full sails!

9
00:01:47,128 --> 00:01:49,610
Captain!
The ship will run aground.

10
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:51,115
It's impossible!

11
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:54,236
You know my views on that word,
Mr. Phelps.

12
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:58,545
Full sails.
Full sails!

13
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:00,873
Full sails, boys!

14
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:02,658
Full sails!

15
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:08,963
Hard to port, Harper!

16
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,629
Turning to port at full sail
will tip us over.

17
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,473
Exactly!

18
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:21,848
Lads, get those sails down!

19
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:23,813
We haven't got all day!

20
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:30,566
Hold on, everyone!

21
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:38,240
It's too shallow.

22
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:41,365
We need full sails!

23
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:46,501
Will! Hold on, lad!
Help!

24
00:03:10,782 --> 00:03:11,983
She's going over.

25
00:03:16,288 --> 00:03:17,658
Hold on, boys!

26
00:03:23,753 --> 00:03:24,954
Hold on, lads!

27
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,939
You did it, captain!

28
00:04:08,497 --> 00:04:11,096
The only way to achieve the
impossible...

29
00:04:11,195 --> 00:04:13,330
is to believe it is possible.

30
00:04:13,961 --> 00:04:16,512
Set a course for London, Harper.

31
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:19,632
Our work here is done.

32
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:23,144
Splice the mainbrace, lads!
We're going home!

33
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:13,231
Captain ashore!

34
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,730
Captain.

35
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:25,408
Mother!

36
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:29,331
Here you are... finally.

37
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,620
Miss Kingsleigh?

38
00:05:31,747 --> 00:05:33,827
You and The Wonder have been
expected for over a year.

39
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,211
There were complications.

40
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:36,588
Pirates and such.

41
00:05:36,752 --> 00:05:37,920
The ledgers are in my cabin.

42
00:05:38,021 --> 00:05:39,216
And would you please let lord
Ascot know...

43
00:05:39,317 --> 00:05:41,423
I should like to see him,
immediately.

44
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:45,178
I'm afraid lord Ascot passed
away, whilst you were at sea.

45
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:47,096
The title's been passed on to
his son.

46
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,274
Hamish?
Indeed.

47
00:05:49,566 --> 00:05:50,886
Now, chairman of the board.

48
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:53,689
How unfortunate.

49
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,793
Your letters were so infrequent.

50
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,293
I hardly know where you've
been, all this time.

51
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:13,117
Mother, China's incredible.

52
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,579
We followed the Yangtze deep
into the interior.

53
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,492
Most of the people had never
seen a person...

54
00:06:18,593 --> 00:06:19,882
with yellow hair, before.

55
00:06:19,981 --> 00:06:22,120
Were you never afraid?
Of course!

56
00:06:22,918 --> 00:06:25,536
But, when I was, I thought of
father.

57
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:26,973
You sound just like him.

58
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,622
I miss him.

59
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:33,641
I do, too...

60
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:36,398
but the years pass quickly for
me, now.

61
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:39,437
Time is a cruel master.

62
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:43,360
Time is a thief.
And a villain.

63
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:46,992
I hear the Ascots are marking
Hamish's succession, tonight.

64
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:49,545
Perfect!
We should go.

65
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:52,625
I'm afraid the invitation must
have been lost in the post.

66
00:06:52,725 --> 00:06:56,182
Nonsense. Lady ascot once said
we would always be welcome.

67
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,600
Besides, I have a proposition
for Hamish.

68
00:06:58,699 --> 00:07:00,869
Hamish married last year, Alice.

69
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:03,086
He seems to have got over your
public rejection.

70
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:05,586
A business proposition, mother.

71
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,846
You're leaving again?
So soon?

72
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,810
There are matters here...

73
00:07:11,911 --> 00:07:13,964
which might benefit from your
attention.

74
00:07:14,064 --> 00:07:15,351
After my next voyage...

75
00:07:15,451 --> 00:07:17,886
you won't have to worry about
anything.

76
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,970
Am I permitted to worry about
tonight?

77
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:33,504
I do wish you'd worn that
yellow dress.

78
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:36,542
If it's good enough for the
dowager empress of China...

79
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,377
then it's good enough for
the Ascots.

80
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:40,632
Must you always be so
headstrong?

81
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,971
No.
It's just more fun, that way.

82
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:53,966
What is she wearing?

83
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:55,730
It's the Kingsleigh girl.

84
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:56,704
Excuse me.

85
00:07:56,805 --> 00:07:58,058
Outrageous!

86
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:00,305
Circus performer...

87
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:03,202
Miss Kingsleigh?

88
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:04,884
What are you doing here?

89
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:07,875
I've come to give my report
to lord Ascot.

90
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:09,904
Right.

91
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:11,372
Well, follow me.

92
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,707
Helen?
What a surprise.

93
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:27,201
Alice.
Well... welcome home!

94
00:08:27,235 --> 00:08:30,144
We were afraid you might never
come back with our ship.

95
00:08:30,244 --> 00:08:32,346
My ship.
Hello, Hamish.

96
00:08:32,446 --> 00:08:34,792
It's proper to refer to my
husband as lord Ascot.

97
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:37,817
That is why we're having this
little soire, after all.

98
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:41,773
Miss Kingsleigh, this is my
wife, Alexandra.

99
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:44,220
The new lady Ascot.

100
00:08:44,515 --> 00:08:45,466
So...

101
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:48,082
Hamish tells me you've traveled
the world, these last three years.

102
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:49,567
Yes.
I've just returned.

103
00:08:49,568 --> 00:08:51,768
Well, then... how was it?

104
00:08:51,868 --> 00:08:54,633
The world?
Yes.

105
00:08:55,786 --> 00:08:59,500
Highly enjoyable.
You should visit it, sometime.

106
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,097
Apologies for the intrusion,
lord Ascot...

107
00:09:04,197 --> 00:09:06,423
but I've come to give my report.

108
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:07,965
Of course.

109
00:09:08,841 --> 00:09:10,856
Follow me, Miss Kingsleigh.

110
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:13,798
And you, Mr. Harcourt.

111
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:21,517
Gentlemen, might I introduce
Miss Alice Kingsleigh.

112
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:23,933
Miss Kingsleigh, the board.

113
00:09:25,282 --> 00:09:26,698
Good evening, gentlemen.

114
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:30,304
The world has opened to us,
but we must move quickly.

115
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:33,486
It is my belief that further
expeditions along the Wu river...

116
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:35,157
I'm sorry, Miss Kingsleigh.

117
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,663
There will be no further
expeditions.

118
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,972
What?
Now...

119
00:09:41,072 --> 00:09:44,056
there is a position in our
clerking office.

120
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:47,081
You will start in files, but in
time...

121
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:50,554
This isn't about China, is it?

122
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,783
It's because I turned you down,
when you asked me to marry you.

123
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,413
I am sorry, Miss Kingsleigh...

124
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:59,739
but this is all that we can
do for you.

125
00:09:59,838 --> 00:10:01,522
No other company is in the
business...

126
00:10:01,621 --> 00:10:04,043
of hiring female clerks, hm?

127
00:10:04,177 --> 00:10:06,015
Let alone, ship's captains.

128
00:10:11,095 --> 00:10:14,873
You can't do this!
I own 10% of the company.

129
00:10:15,008 --> 00:10:16,697
Your father set those shares
aside, for me.

130
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:18,624
Correction.

131
00:10:18,994 --> 00:10:20,543
He gave them to your mother...

132
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:23,813
who sold them to me a year ago,
while you were gone...

133
00:10:23,913 --> 00:10:25,807
along with the bond on the
house.

134
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:26,986
Her house?

135
00:10:27,022 --> 00:10:29,852
The bond we will redeem against
your ship.

136
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,769
But that was my father's ship.

137
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,133
Indeed.

138
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:37,717
Sign over the vessel...

139
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:39,971
and you will redeem the house.

140
00:10:40,397 --> 00:10:42,100
Report to work Monday morning...

141
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:44,889
and you will receive a salary
and a pension.

142
00:10:45,354 --> 00:10:46,813
And give up The Wonder?

143
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:50,325
Otherwise, we cannot help you...

144
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:52,364
or your mother.

145
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,200
Alice...

146
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,246
Alice!

147
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:09,591
Alice?

148
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:11,092
How could you sell our shares?

149
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:13,917
Everything I do is for you,
Alice...

150
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:16,236
so you can make a decent start
in life.

151
00:11:16,336 --> 00:11:18,100
Five minutes ago I was a sea
captain.

152
00:11:18,201 --> 00:11:20,909
A sea captain is no job for
a lady.

153
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:24,153
Time is against you, and you're
being careless with it.

154
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:28,932
I once believed I could do as
many as six impossible things...

155
00:11:29,033 --> 00:11:32,976
before breakfast.
That is a child's dream, Alice.

156
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,450
The Wonder is just a ship.

157
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:39,241
It's not just a ship.

158
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:41,090
It's father's ship.

159
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:42,794
Everything he loved.

160
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:44,500
Everything I love.

161
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:45,979
He never would have let this
happen.

162
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:48,349
Well, he's not here, anymore!

163
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:53,748
You can't just make things
however you want them to be.

164
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,884
Every woman must face that,
Alice.

165
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,809
I've had, to.

166
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:01,394
Well, the last thing I want,
is to end up like you.

167
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,323
Sign over The Wonder?

168
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,953
And give up on the impossible?

169
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:25,038
Then, who will I be?

170
00:12:27,623 --> 00:12:30,883
You're Alice, of course.

171
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:34,914
Absolem?

172
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:42,182
Absolem!

173
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:58,225
She'd spent months up river.
Dressed like she'd gone native.

174
00:12:58,325 --> 00:13:01,043
And of course, it's known to do
strange things to a man's mind...

175
00:13:01,144 --> 00:13:02,686
let alone a woman's.

176
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,775
Wait!
Just like her father.

177
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,913
A great man, no doubt, but one
touched in the head.

178
00:13:08,013 --> 00:13:11,437
It appears the apple has not
fallen far from the tree.

179
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,325
Absolem!

180
00:13:56,211 --> 00:13:57,551
Curious...

181
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,586
It's locked!
Someone's in there.

182
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:02,255
Who's in there?
Who's in there?

183
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:04,303
You're trespassing!
This room is out of bounds!

184
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,801
Someone, get the key!

185
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,520
Lord Ascot, there's someone
in your father's study!

186
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:34,374
Curious and curiouser...

187
00:15:05,364 --> 00:15:07,073
Oh, no, not again!

188
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,995
All my horses, all my men, to
the rescue!

189
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:25,600
All the pieces together first,
chaps.

190
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,836
In a pile, over here.

191
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,679
How do I look? Tell me.
I can take it.

192
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:31,508
He's not all he's cracked up
to be.

193
00:15:31,682 --> 00:15:33,756
He's a mere shell of a man.

194
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:35,886
Oh, please.
You always make that joke.

195
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:37,405
Don't you mean "yolk"?

196
00:15:37,505 --> 00:15:40,123
Get some new material.
I would be most grateful...

197
00:15:40,222 --> 00:15:41,106
if someone were able...
Sorry.

198
00:15:41,172 --> 00:15:43,861
Clumsy as always, and twice
as dim.

199
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:46,028
I thought you'd never get
the idea.

200
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:47,971
Oh, Absolem.
Excuse me, young lady.

201
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,806
We'll be needing that.
Oh, you all disgust me!

202
00:15:50,841 --> 00:15:53,334
You've been gone too long,
Alice.

203
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:56,576
And he will be gone, before
long.

204
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:59,376
Who will be gone?
What has happened?

205
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,534
All will become clear in the
fullness of time.

206
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:06,490
For now... hurry.

207
00:16:06,923 --> 00:16:08,339
Oh...

208
00:16:08,402 --> 00:16:11,278
and do mind your step.

209
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:26,438
Hey!

210
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:44,712
Alice.
Oh, Alice!

211
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,587
Thank goodness you're finally
here!

212
00:16:47,725 --> 00:16:49,758
It's that girl, again!

213
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:51,855
Alice...

214
00:16:51,956 --> 00:16:53,448
you're back!

215
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:00,418
Don't be nice to her.
She's late.

216
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,807
Have I come at a bad time?

217
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,206
On the contrary...

218
00:17:03,315 --> 00:17:04,734
we were afraid you weren't
coming, at all.

219
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:07,641
What's the matter?
The Hatter's the matter.

220
00:17:07,717 --> 00:17:09,454
Or, the matter of the Hatter.

221
00:17:09,555 --> 00:17:12,138
The former.
No, the latter.

222
00:17:12,338 --> 00:17:13,951
Tweedles?

223
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,512
He's mad.

224
00:17:17,613 --> 00:17:18,856
The Hatter?

225
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:21,210
Yes, I know.

226
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:22,924
That's his muchness.

227
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,952
That's what makes him so...

228
00:17:25,871 --> 00:17:26,701
him.

229
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,801
But he's grown darker...

230
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:28,971
less dafter.

231
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:31,278
Denies himself laughter.

232
00:17:31,378 --> 00:17:35,500
And no scheme of ours can
raise any sort of smile.

233
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:40,267
We rather hoped you might help
us save him.

234
00:17:40,301 --> 00:17:41,596
What happened?

235
00:17:41,731 --> 00:17:43,402
There was a great storm.

236
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:48,106
We ventured out into the Tulgey
woods, to investigate.

237
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:53,888
Come, Quadruped.

238
00:17:54,825 --> 00:17:56,211
Fetch!

239
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,083
Your turn!

240
00:18:01,832 --> 00:18:03,211
Fetch, doggy.

241
00:18:03,409 --> 00:18:05,900
Hatter was perfectly hatterish.

242
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:07,837
Until...

243
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:11,165
that blue paper hat...

244
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:14,046
somehow put him in mind...

245
00:18:15,311 --> 00:18:17,336
of his family's tragedy.

246
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:26,068
Slain by the Jabberwocky, on
Horunvendush day...

247
00:18:26,169 --> 00:18:28,117
many years ago.

248
00:18:28,218 --> 00:18:30,789
He's just not himself, anymore.

249
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:35,039
But, if anything could bring
the Hatter back...

250
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,273
it would be seeing you, again.

251
00:18:37,451 --> 00:18:38,701
Oh, yes.
Indeed.

252
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:42,695
Well, where is he?

253
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,680
Go away!

254
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:01,521
You can't come in.

255
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,232
Hatter, it's me...

256
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:04,893
Alice!

257
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:09,439
Alice?

258
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:11,568
You're you.

259
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:13,528
And you're here.

260
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,736
You are you, aren't you?

261
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:22,579
Yes, Hatter.

262
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:25,536
Good.

263
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,881
You're the only one.

264
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:36,573
But you've always been Alice...

265
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:40,096
and that's how I know you'll
believe me.

266
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:42,594
I've missed you, Hatter.

267
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:45,137
It's my family, Alice.

268
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:47,768
Your family?

269
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:51,609
Yes.
My family.

270
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:54,065
Lost for many years.

271
00:19:56,113 --> 00:19:57,952
Or, so I thought.

272
00:19:58,781 --> 00:19:59,912
Look...

273
00:20:01,076 --> 00:20:02,650
I found this.

274
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:06,157
The first hat I ever made.

275
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:09,170
I thought I'd tossed it away
long, long ago.

276
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:12,632
It's impossible for it to be
here, and yet...

277
00:20:14,298 --> 00:20:16,075
here it is.

278
00:20:17,342 --> 00:20:22,392
So, if this hat survived, my
family must have, too.

279
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:24,160
But, Hatter, that's...

280
00:20:24,259 --> 00:20:27,641
I thought I wasn't worthy of
the Hightopp name.

281
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:32,605
Very serious man, my father.

282
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:35,781
We had a terrible fight.

283
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,740
I never said I was sorry, when
I had the chance.

284
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,326
But this means...

285
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:48,154
that I can make things right.

286
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:49,825
Hatter...

287
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:52,634
your family, uh...

288
00:20:54,296 --> 00:20:55,336
You...

289
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,588
do believe me, don't you, Alice?

290
00:20:59,843 --> 00:21:01,643
I want to, I...

291
00:21:05,348 --> 00:21:06,751
Hatter!

292
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:10,607
You're not well!
What can I do?

293
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:14,941
Of course.

294
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:17,193
My Alice...

295
00:21:17,361 --> 00:21:20,111
could bring my family back
to me.

296
00:21:21,198 --> 00:21:22,617
Oh, but...

297
00:21:23,241 --> 00:21:25,491
Hatter, the thing is...

298
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,329
your family died.

299
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,036
Long ago.

300
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,666
You told me so, yourself.

301
00:21:35,671 --> 00:21:38,340
No one can bring them back.

302
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:43,852
No one, but you.

303
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,224
I'm sorry...

304
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:53,200
but it's...

305
00:21:55,816 --> 00:21:57,566
it's impossible.

306
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:09,159
You...

307
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,288
are not you.

308
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:19,314
Hatter, please!
Get out.

309
00:22:21,592 --> 00:22:23,859
I don't know who you are.

310
00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:27,635
You're not my Alice.

311
00:22:28,432 --> 00:22:31,068
My Alice would believe me.

312
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:39,787
Hatter?

313
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:42,364
Hatter, please!

314
00:22:43,322 --> 00:22:45,102
Please!

315
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:56,201
We must do something!
He's so terribly ill.

316
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,380
I fear he's...

317
00:22:58,545 --> 00:22:59,694
dying!

318
00:23:00,005 --> 00:23:01,005
Oh, dear.

319
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:03,518
Oh dear, oh dear.
No...

320
00:23:03,617 --> 00:23:06,382
We can't lose him, Alice.
We can't!

321
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:10,131
He said, to make him better,
I must bring his family back.

322
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:12,104
But that's, uh...

323
00:23:12,518 --> 00:23:13,978
it cannot be!

324
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:17,308
Unless it could.

325
00:23:17,689 --> 00:23:18,818
What?
Oh...

326
00:23:23,653 --> 00:23:25,973
Unless, there was a way.

327
00:23:26,209 --> 00:23:27,157
No, no, no, no, no.

328
00:23:27,258 --> 00:23:29,252
You mustn't, you mustn't.
What is it?

329
00:23:29,353 --> 00:23:32,163
It is dangerous. Perilous.
It is too much to ask!

330
00:23:32,663 --> 00:23:33,712
What is it?

331
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,423
Alice...

332
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:40,455
you must travel back in time.
Oh, no!

333
00:23:40,556 --> 00:23:43,338
Go back into the past and save
the Hatter's family.

334
00:23:43,507 --> 00:23:45,967
If the Hatter's delusion is
made true...

335
00:23:46,134 --> 00:23:48,992
then he would be made well,
again.

336
00:23:49,093 --> 00:23:50,759
Go back in time?

337
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:54,320
But, how?
The Chronosphere.

338
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:55,773
I'm sorry, the Chrono-what?

339
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:57,307
The Chronosphere.

340
00:23:57,406 --> 00:24:01,589
The source that powers the
Grand Clock of all time.

341
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:05,861
Legend has, it also lets one
travel across the ocean of time.

342
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,371
None of us can use it because
we've already been in the past.

343
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:12,844
And if your past self sees
your future self...

344
00:24:13,244 --> 00:24:14,857
What happens?

345
00:24:15,413 --> 00:24:16,834
There is no history of it
happening...

346
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:18,877
but it is said that if it were
to happen...

347
00:24:18,913 --> 00:24:21,375
everything would be history.

348
00:24:22,296 --> 00:24:23,796
That sounds very dangerous.

349
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:26,054
It is.
Extremely, so.

350
00:24:26,508 --> 00:24:30,316
Because you're not from here,
only you can use it, Alice.

351
00:24:30,415 --> 00:24:31,854
It's not impossible...

352
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:33,182
merely...

353
00:24:33,598 --> 00:24:34,848
un-possible.

354
00:24:35,575 --> 00:24:37,383
Got ya!

355
00:24:39,688 --> 00:24:41,518
Hatter is my truest friend.

356
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:44,949
If he's in need, I will help
him. No matter what.

357
00:24:45,048 --> 00:24:46,827
Hooray!
Oh, Alice!

358
00:24:46,927 --> 00:24:49,477
So brave.
I knew she'd help us.

359
00:24:49,573 --> 00:24:51,943
Where exactly is this Chronosphere?

360
00:24:52,075 --> 00:24:54,536
In the hands of Time.
It's his.

361
00:24:55,287 --> 00:24:58,457
I'm sorry.
Time, is a he?

362
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:05,546
He lives in a void of infinitude,
in a castle of eternity.

363
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:09,799
Through here, one mile past
the pendulum.

364
00:25:19,353 --> 00:25:20,732
Oh, very cold.

365
00:25:21,104 --> 00:25:23,364
Find Time's castle, borrow
the Chronosphere...

366
00:25:23,523 --> 00:25:25,619
travel back in time to Horunvendush
day...

367
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,359
save the Hatter's family from
being killed...

368
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,162
and thereby, save the Hatter.

369
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:33,425
And do try not to break the
past, present, or future.

370
00:25:33,526 --> 00:25:36,155
Chez...
I was only trying to help.

371
00:25:36,241 --> 00:25:38,042
What could go wrong?

372
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:57,059
Fairfarren, Alice.

373
00:25:57,223 --> 00:25:58,983
Hatter's counting on you.

374
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:00,942
We all, are.

375
00:27:28,565 --> 00:27:29,644
Hello?

376
00:27:32,068 --> 00:27:33,449
Anybody here?

377
00:27:53,006 --> 00:27:54,336
Hello?

378
00:28:25,239 --> 00:28:28,121
Stupid me-shaped corridor!

379
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:39,010
Will this day never end?

380
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:43,289
It clings to me like a pair of
sweaty pantaloons.

381
00:28:56,361 --> 00:28:58,911
Who has stopped?

382
00:28:59,072 --> 00:29:00,644
Who has ticked...

383
00:29:00,699 --> 00:29:02,028
their last tock?

384
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:06,228
Tocked their last tick?

385
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:17,893
Ah...

386
00:29:18,592 --> 00:29:19,842
Brilliam...

387
00:29:20,928 --> 00:29:22,347
Hinkle.

388
00:29:31,355 --> 00:29:33,365
Brilliam Hinkle.

389
00:29:34,691 --> 00:29:36,191
Your time is up!

390
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:51,757
Let's put you away, Mr. Hinkle...

391
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:54,880
in the right place, like alphabetical
order.

392
00:29:58,848 --> 00:30:00,719
Ah!
Higgens, uh...

393
00:30:01,551 --> 00:30:03,392
Highbottom...

394
00:30:03,554 --> 00:30:05,104
Not here, yet.

395
00:30:05,596 --> 00:30:07,426
Highturn...

396
00:30:07,974 --> 00:30:09,553
Highview, Himmelby...

397
00:30:09,653 --> 00:30:12,412
Ah!
Hinkle.

398
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:16,229
I hope you were happy.
I hope you used your time well.

399
00:30:16,275 --> 00:30:18,535
Good night.

400
00:30:22,573 --> 00:30:23,874
Who is there?

401
00:30:23,973 --> 00:30:25,480
I saw you!

402
00:30:25,784 --> 00:30:29,457
How did you get in?
It is impossible!

403
00:30:29,525 --> 00:30:33,240
Come out, little wriggling
worm!

404
00:30:35,531 --> 00:30:38,299
Oh... it's a girl.
Please, sir.

405
00:30:38,422 --> 00:30:39,743
I'm sorry to disturb you...

406
00:30:39,844 --> 00:30:41,882
but if I could just have a
moment of your time.

407
00:30:41,967 --> 00:30:43,336
Time?

408
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:45,760
Young lady...

409
00:30:47,431 --> 00:30:49,270
I am...

410
00:30:49,432 --> 00:30:51,063
time.

411
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:54,480
The infinite...

412
00:30:55,021 --> 00:30:56,152
the eternal...

413
00:30:57,106 --> 00:30:58,527
the immortal...

414
00:31:00,318 --> 00:31:02,148
the immeasurable.

415
00:31:03,488 --> 00:31:05,278
Unless you have a clock.

416
00:31:07,201 --> 00:31:08,621
So, being time...

417
00:31:08,785 --> 00:31:11,115
I must give some of myself...

418
00:31:11,288 --> 00:31:13,208
for you to have Me.

419
00:31:13,624 --> 00:31:15,294
Are you following what I'm
saying?

420
00:31:15,459 --> 00:31:16,209
Yes.

421
00:31:16,626 --> 00:31:19,056
Really?
Oh...

422
00:31:19,546 --> 00:31:21,977
Do you promise to be concise?
Well, I can most...

423
00:31:22,076 --> 00:31:24,549
Because if there's one thing
I do not like, it is...

424
00:31:24,718 --> 00:31:27,468
people who are unable, unwilling,
or, uh...

425
00:31:27,688 --> 00:31:30,750
un, em, em... un, eh...

426
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:35,328
compelled to form short sentences.
Mh?

427
00:31:35,429 --> 00:31:37,273
My friend is in mortal danger.

428
00:31:37,374 --> 00:31:39,537
Enough of your incessant
jabbering!

429
00:31:39,672 --> 00:31:42,646
I have important work to do.

430
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:44,738
Please!

431
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,570
You haven't answered my question.

432
00:31:49,867 --> 00:31:50,867
One minute.

433
00:31:51,369 --> 00:31:54,660
Why do you carry that fallen
soldier in your pocket?

434
00:31:54,965 --> 00:31:56,822
Reveal him, now.

435
00:31:56,875 --> 00:31:58,635
He is broken.

436
00:31:58,751 --> 00:31:59,751
Kaput.

437
00:32:00,211 --> 00:32:02,372
It was my father's.
I would never part with it.

438
00:32:02,506 --> 00:32:06,188
Everyone parts with everything
eventually, my dear.

439
00:32:12,098 --> 00:32:13,896
Behold!

440
00:32:17,688 --> 00:32:22,577
The magnificent Grand Clock
of all time.

441
00:32:25,362 --> 00:32:27,701
He is me, and I am he...

442
00:32:27,865 --> 00:32:31,494
all that was, or ever shall be.

443
00:32:32,118 --> 00:32:33,868
I thought up that poem.

444
00:32:35,963 --> 00:32:38,085
Now, remember.
Look lively, everyone.

445
00:32:38,184 --> 00:32:41,741
Ah... Wilkins!
Shoulders back, eyes forward.

446
00:32:41,842 --> 00:32:44,421
How is my invincible machine?

447
00:32:44,589 --> 00:32:46,358
Vell, it's...
Silence!

448
00:32:47,092 --> 00:32:49,221
You will speak, when you are
spoken, to.

449
00:32:49,427 --> 00:32:51,161
He was spoken, to.
Nonsense!

450
00:32:51,221 --> 00:32:52,260
The machine, Wilkins.

451
00:32:52,722 --> 00:32:53,893
How is it?

452
00:32:58,979 --> 00:32:59,729
Hello.

453
00:33:00,439 --> 00:33:01,818
And who might you be?

454
00:33:01,981 --> 00:33:05,571
These miniscule artisans are
my seconds.

455
00:33:06,068 --> 00:33:07,028
Curious!

456
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:09,570
And I suppose every second
counts.

457
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:10,910
Count?
I wish.

458
00:33:12,742 --> 00:33:14,913
They are rather stupid.

459
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,998
That was rude of me.
I'm sorry.

460
00:33:32,512 --> 00:33:34,932
I told you.
Imbeciles.

461
00:33:35,097 --> 00:33:36,097
Come on.

462
00:33:39,932 --> 00:33:41,243
So...

463
00:33:41,313 --> 00:33:42,412
your question.

464
00:33:42,511 --> 00:33:45,830
What is it?
You have exactly one minute.

465
00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:47,782
It's about the Hatter...

466
00:33:48,278 --> 00:33:50,638
Tarrant Hightopp.
He's a great friend of mine.

467
00:33:50,739 --> 00:33:52,977
And recently he's convinced
that his long-deceased family...

468
00:33:53,076 --> 00:33:53,878
is still alive.

469
00:33:53,913 --> 00:33:55,697
And, of course, his family
cannot really be alive...

470
00:33:55,826 --> 00:33:57,049
because you see, the Jabberwocky
killed his family...

471
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:57,901
on the Horunvendush day...

472
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,236
and I killed the Jabberwocky
on the Frabjous day...

473
00:33:59,336 --> 00:34:00,536
and I'd like your permission
to borrow the Chronosphere.

474
00:34:00,635 --> 00:34:02,126
It is imperative that...

475
00:34:03,376 --> 00:34:04,957
The Chronosphere.

476
00:34:05,628 --> 00:34:06,709
That wasn't a minute!

477
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,130
You want to borrow it.

478
00:34:08,632 --> 00:34:10,190
Loan it.

479
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:12,577
Purloin it.

480
00:34:12,677 --> 00:34:13,467
Yes.

481
00:34:17,807 --> 00:34:19,918
You ask...

482
00:34:21,143 --> 00:34:23,614
to disintegrate history.

483
00:34:23,748 --> 00:34:25,900
The Chronosphere powers the
grand clock.

484
00:34:26,065 --> 00:34:27,226
But, I need it.

485
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,418
Without it, the Hatter may
never get better...

486
00:34:29,518 --> 00:34:31,300
and I have to...
Wilkins?

487
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:32,364
Wilkins!

488
00:34:32,822 --> 00:34:33,992
Stupid door.
Wilkins!

489
00:34:34,324 --> 00:34:35,494
Did you call, sir?

490
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:38,539
Wilkins, please remove this...

491
00:34:38,704 --> 00:34:41,664
yellow-haired kindergartener,
here.

492
00:34:42,164 --> 00:34:43,204
Immediately, sir!

493
00:34:43,708 --> 00:34:45,039
No interlopers!

494
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:46,750
Thank you for your you, sir.

495
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,710
Come along, come along.

496
00:34:49,422 --> 00:34:51,172
My what?

497
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,340
For your time.

498
00:34:53,677 --> 00:34:54,677
Young lady...

499
00:34:56,179 --> 00:34:57,599
you cannot change the past...

500
00:34:57,764 --> 00:35:00,983
though I dare say, you might
learn something from it.

501
00:35:04,396 --> 00:35:05,556
Come on, you!

502
00:35:07,398 --> 00:35:09,528
Uh, this next generation...

503
00:35:10,693 --> 00:35:13,954
Now, back the way you came,
miss.

504
00:35:14,114 --> 00:35:15,744
All ze way to the end.

505
00:35:18,335 --> 00:35:20,496
Auf wiedersehen!

506
00:35:21,463 --> 00:35:23,967
Wilkins!
Yes, sir!

507
00:35:24,101 --> 00:35:25,384
She's here!
My liebchen is here!

508
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:26,541
Coming, sir!

509
00:35:27,043 --> 00:35:28,844
Hurry!
Quick!

510
00:35:32,965 --> 00:35:35,715
All right. Here we go. Ding, ding!
Seconds out! Seconds out!

511
00:35:46,438 --> 00:35:47,228
Get back.

512
00:35:47,773 --> 00:35:48,943
Stay in line.
Stay in line!

513
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:53,581
Your highness.
Your majesty!

514
00:35:53,681 --> 00:35:54,735
Majesty!

515
00:35:55,155 --> 00:35:57,614
My lord is expecting you in
the parlor.

516
00:35:57,782 --> 00:35:59,663
Shall I announce you?

517
00:35:59,826 --> 00:36:02,996
Oh, no mind!
I'll announce myself.

518
00:36:03,914 --> 00:36:08,253
Tick-Tock!
Where are you?

519
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:11,420
Tick-Tock!
Where are you?

520
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:14,840
Tick-Tock!

521
00:36:15,007 --> 00:36:16,007
Coming, my love!

522
00:36:19,179 --> 00:36:20,179
Present!

523
00:36:20,556 --> 00:36:21,425
Of course.

524
00:36:26,353 --> 00:36:27,523
My darling...

525
00:36:28,349 --> 00:36:33,784
May I say that your head is
looking very, very big, today.

526
00:36:38,364 --> 00:36:44,405
I present you with a gift made
entirely out of love.

527
00:36:44,954 --> 00:36:47,375
And also a little bit of metal
and wood, of course.

528
00:36:48,958 --> 00:36:52,128
I know how you love the tiny
things.

529
00:37:07,143 --> 00:37:08,983
I'll treasure it forever.

530
00:37:11,063 --> 00:37:12,273
Good!

531
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,280
Oh, dear.

532
00:37:41,637 --> 00:37:43,297
The Chronosphere.

533
00:37:43,722 --> 00:37:45,851
What troubles you, my dear?

534
00:37:46,016 --> 00:37:48,516
You know what it is that I
desire.

535
00:37:49,436 --> 00:37:52,356
But, my love, I have done so
much for you, already.

536
00:37:52,981 --> 00:37:54,190
Yes, yes, that's all very well.

537
00:37:55,442 --> 00:37:56,862
But don't you see?

538
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,490
That...

539
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:02,949
with my big brain...

540
00:38:03,534 --> 00:38:04,664
and your...

541
00:38:05,494 --> 00:38:06,873
little Chronosphere...

542
00:38:07,704 --> 00:38:10,135
I could get even with my sister...

543
00:38:10,335 --> 00:38:14,063
and we could rule the past,
the present...

544
00:38:14,163 --> 00:38:17,219
and the future.

545
00:38:27,516 --> 00:38:30,346
You ask the impossible, my dear.

546
00:38:30,853 --> 00:38:34,063
I cannot give you the Chronosphere.

547
00:38:34,523 --> 00:38:36,112
You would if you loved me!

548
00:38:37,275 --> 00:38:39,315
No one loves me.

549
00:38:39,485 --> 00:38:40,856
No one fears me.

550
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,030
But I do love you.

551
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:45,199
Kiss?

552
00:38:45,617 --> 00:38:46,407
Oh, no.

553
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:09,059
The Grand Clock!

554
00:39:11,601 --> 00:39:12,942
Wilkins!

555
00:39:13,103 --> 00:39:14,523
Right behind you, sir!

556
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:16,108
Tick-Tock?

557
00:39:30,996 --> 00:39:32,746
Seconds into minutes.

558
00:39:53,393 --> 00:39:54,643
Tick-Tock!

559
00:39:55,103 --> 00:39:57,273
Don't abandon me when I'm
sulking!

560
00:40:25,016 --> 00:40:26,376
What's the matter with you?

561
00:40:26,552 --> 00:40:28,302
The Chronosphere.

562
00:40:31,306 --> 00:40:33,135
Alice...

563
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,190
No!

564
00:40:41,567 --> 00:40:42,567
Stop her!

565
00:40:48,114 --> 00:40:49,914
Stop her, you imbeciles!

566
00:40:58,583 --> 00:41:00,713
Which idiot labeled that?

567
00:41:01,085 --> 00:41:02,166
You did, my lord.

568
00:41:02,588 --> 00:41:04,338
Thank you for admitting your
mistake.

569
00:41:05,556 --> 00:41:07,007
Idiot!

570
00:41:07,775 --> 00:41:09,552
How do I work this?

571
00:41:14,182 --> 00:41:15,643
Halt!
Stop!

572
00:41:20,438 --> 00:41:22,318
Stop, you little mouse!

573
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:24,231
No... no!

574
00:41:54,972 --> 00:41:57,561
How do I look? Tell me.
I can take it.

575
00:41:57,661 --> 00:42:00,693
He's a mere shell of a man.

576
00:42:01,605 --> 00:42:02,985
It's like a ship.

577
00:42:04,907 --> 00:42:06,027
Dead ahead.

578
00:42:11,782 --> 00:42:13,871
Come, quadruped.
Fetch!

579
00:42:14,284 --> 00:42:15,583
Hatter!

580
00:42:26,963 --> 00:42:28,264
Don't worry, Hatter.

581
00:42:28,798 --> 00:42:30,628
I'll save you, and your family.

582
00:42:40,643 --> 00:42:41,643
Alice?

583
00:42:44,856 --> 00:42:46,726
The Alice?

584
00:42:48,485 --> 00:42:52,047
Slayer of my Jabber-baby-wocky?

585
00:42:54,221 --> 00:42:59,625
The very reason why I have been
banished from my kingdom?

586
00:43:00,454 --> 00:43:01,614
That Alice?

587
00:43:02,039 --> 00:43:03,039
Idiot!

588
00:43:03,208 --> 00:43:07,498
I want her head!

589
00:43:14,135 --> 00:43:15,885
Are you all right, sir?

590
00:43:16,429 --> 00:43:17,809
It has begun.

591
00:43:18,806 --> 00:43:20,226
Without the chronosphere...

592
00:43:20,726 --> 00:43:22,846
the Grand Clock will break
down...

593
00:43:23,394 --> 00:43:24,684
time, myself, will stop...

594
00:43:24,967 --> 00:43:27,570
and all in Underland will perish.

595
00:43:27,733 --> 00:43:29,233
Did you say perish?

596
00:43:29,693 --> 00:43:33,032
Wilkins, you must keep the
Grand Clock ticking.

597
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:35,010
Me?
I said that out loud, didn't I?

598
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:37,666
I mean, of course, sir.

599
00:43:37,802 --> 00:43:42,331
And I, I must find the kindergartner.

600
00:43:45,041 --> 00:43:46,751
Oh, my goodness!

601
00:43:47,628 --> 00:43:48,338
What's happening?

602
00:43:50,213 --> 00:43:51,974
She must have the Chronosphere.

603
00:43:55,719 --> 00:44:00,059
Take care, dear Alice.
All our hopes fly with you.

604
00:44:11,318 --> 00:44:12,938
Horunvendush day!

605
00:44:31,588 --> 00:44:32,757
You!

606
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:35,130
Give me what is mine!

607
00:44:35,509 --> 00:44:36,628
Give it back...

608
00:44:37,177 --> 00:44:39,387
or there will be none of me
left.

609
00:44:41,514 --> 00:44:43,855
Come back.
Come back!

610
00:44:47,771 --> 00:44:49,731
You cannot win in a race against
time.

611
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:53,030
I am inevitable!

612
00:45:48,206 --> 00:45:49,206
Hatter?

613
00:45:51,585 --> 00:45:52,505
Hatter?

614
00:45:54,713 --> 00:45:55,762
It's you!

615
00:45:56,255 --> 00:45:57,545
You're you again!

616
00:45:57,715 --> 00:45:59,376
Well, if I'm not, I wish I was.

617
00:46:01,219 --> 00:46:02,849
Have we met?
Yes!

618
00:46:03,554 --> 00:46:05,518
Well, no.
I mean, not yet.

619
00:46:05,619 --> 00:46:07,442
It's funny, I feel like I trully
know you.

620
00:46:07,541 --> 00:46:09,684
Well, we have met once, when
I was younger.

621
00:46:09,784 --> 00:46:11,483
Oh, I'm afraid I don't recall.

622
00:46:11,583 --> 00:46:13,202
That's because it hasn't happened
yet.

623
00:46:13,856 --> 00:46:15,963
When will it happen?
Years from now.

624
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:17,400
When you're older.

625
00:46:17,568 --> 00:46:19,989
I'll meet you when you're younger
and I'm older?

626
00:46:21,197 --> 00:46:22,907
I realize it doesn't make much sense.

627
00:46:23,617 --> 00:46:24,867
Makes perfect sense to me.

628
00:46:25,327 --> 00:46:26,036
I'm Tarrant.

629
00:46:26,202 --> 00:46:27,583
I know. I'm Alice.

630
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:30,619
Alice, you seem to have time
all mixed up.

631
00:46:31,123 --> 00:46:32,402
He's not mixed up, at all.

632
00:46:32,501 --> 00:46:35,188
Actually, he's quite angry
with me.

633
00:46:35,878 --> 00:46:37,298
You're bonkers, aren't you?

634
00:46:38,297 --> 00:46:39,668
That's what I've been told.

635
00:46:40,092 --> 00:46:41,262
All the best ones are.

636
00:46:41,425 --> 00:46:46,715
Listen, I know it sounds strange,
but I need to find your family.

637
00:46:46,889 --> 00:46:48,809
Oh, well, you're in luck.
Right this way.

638
00:46:52,563 --> 00:46:53,773
Wonderful!

639
00:46:54,146 --> 00:46:55,766
Indeed.

640
00:47:06,451 --> 00:47:08,661
Congratulations, dear Mirana,
on your coming of age.

641
00:47:09,913 --> 00:47:12,893
And now... the heir.

642
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:16,420
The crown for the Princess
Iracebeth.

643
00:47:20,465 --> 00:47:22,045
Ignorant peasants.

644
00:47:36,606 --> 00:47:38,226
Quiet!

645
00:47:41,777 --> 00:47:42,858
What are you doing, you idiot?

646
00:47:47,117 --> 00:47:49,197
Put it on my head!

647
00:47:49,744 --> 00:47:51,164
You're making me look stupid.

648
00:47:51,621 --> 00:47:52,501
Get on with it!

649
00:47:54,291 --> 00:47:56,331
You incompetent imbecile!

650
00:48:12,099 --> 00:48:13,480
Silence!

651
00:48:14,853 --> 00:48:16,773
The next person who laughs
will never laugh again!

652
00:48:18,856 --> 00:48:20,567
Iracebeth, please!

653
00:48:21,025 --> 00:48:23,396
However would you stop people
from laughing?

654
00:48:23,945 --> 00:48:25,315
Put a bag on her head.

655
00:48:30,744 --> 00:48:32,164
Put a bag on your head!

656
00:48:32,538 --> 00:48:33,827
Put a bag on all of your heads!

657
00:48:34,289 --> 00:48:36,579
Yes!
We'll sew up your lips...

658
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:40,590
carve your tongues, cut off
your ears, off with you!

659
00:48:40,711 --> 00:48:42,512
Just off, off, off with their...

660
00:48:42,672 --> 00:48:44,411
off with their...

661
00:48:44,512 --> 00:48:46,936
Iracebeth, enough!

662
00:48:48,554 --> 00:48:50,329
Iracebeth...

663
00:48:50,572 --> 00:48:51,480
I had always hoped...

664
00:48:51,579 --> 00:48:53,798
that you would one day show
the necessary qualities...

665
00:48:53,898 --> 00:48:56,791
to become the queen you were
born to be.

666
00:48:56,891 --> 00:48:59,614
I realize now that day will
never come.

667
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:02,320
People of Witzend...

668
00:49:02,733 --> 00:49:03,864
upon my death...

669
00:49:04,193 --> 00:49:05,954
my crown will pass...

670
00:49:08,072 --> 00:49:09,992
to the Princess Mirana.

671
00:49:13,452 --> 00:49:15,253
Father, no.

672
00:49:15,621 --> 00:49:16,501
But that's not fair!

673
00:49:17,875 --> 00:49:18,795
I'm the eldest!

674
00:49:19,208 --> 00:49:22,248
You are unfit to rule, Iracebeth.

675
00:49:24,172 --> 00:49:25,382
I hate you.

676
00:49:27,259 --> 00:49:32,889
I hate you all!

677
00:49:40,521 --> 00:49:43,862
And I shall not ever forget you,
you sniggering Hightopps!

678
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,451
No, I shall wreak a terrible
revenge!

679
00:49:51,574 --> 00:49:52,664
Vile!

680
00:49:53,202 --> 00:49:54,563
Slow...
Racie?

681
00:49:54,664 --> 00:49:56,422
Oh, don't "Racie" me!

682
00:49:56,496 --> 00:49:58,036
You started it.

683
00:50:01,168 --> 00:50:03,628
Why don't you tell them the
truth?

684
00:50:09,009 --> 00:50:10,719
I didn't think so.

685
00:50:11,637 --> 00:50:13,556
No one loves me.

686
00:50:14,389 --> 00:50:15,719
No one loves me!

687
00:50:15,891 --> 00:50:17,061
Racie...
Iracebeth!

688
00:50:24,315 --> 00:50:27,565
If you are to be a hatter worthy
of the Hightopp name...

689
00:50:28,027 --> 00:50:32,117
you must be sane, sober, disciplined.

690
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:35,621
Everything you now are not!

691
00:50:37,663 --> 00:50:39,253
All I did was laugh, father.

692
00:50:39,623 --> 00:50:43,405
Couldn't help it.
Her head is rather voluminous.

693
00:50:43,505 --> 00:50:46,523
You cost the Princess her crown!

694
00:50:47,338 --> 00:50:48,713
Do you know what this means
to us?

695
00:50:48,813 --> 00:50:50,300
Why am I never good enough
for you?

696
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:54,494
Why are you always such a
disappointment to me?

697
00:50:56,472 --> 00:50:58,432
There.
You've said it.

698
00:50:59,559 --> 00:51:01,690
You've said it, father.

699
00:51:03,188 --> 00:51:04,858
Well, if I'm such a disappointment...

700
00:51:06,942 --> 00:51:08,652
I don't suppose you'll be sorry
if I leave home.

701
00:51:10,057 --> 00:51:11,539
No!

702
00:51:11,639 --> 00:51:12,362
Tarrant?

703
00:51:12,530 --> 00:51:14,201
My hat please, mom.

704
00:51:17,869 --> 00:51:18,869
Tarrant...

705
00:51:22,331 --> 00:51:23,331
Zanik...
No.

706
00:51:23,876 --> 00:51:25,585
please, tell him to stay.

707
00:51:26,003 --> 00:51:28,132
Zanik, please.

708
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,130
Tarrant?

709
00:51:32,592 --> 00:51:33,842
Tarrant?

710
00:51:36,304 --> 00:51:37,315
Hatter!

711
00:51:38,347 --> 00:51:40,847
Hatter, wait!

712
00:51:41,226 --> 00:51:42,266
I am no hatter.

713
00:51:42,768 --> 00:51:45,309
Of course, you are.
You are THE hatter.

714
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:47,230
Or you will be, at least, when I
knew you.

715
00:51:48,692 --> 00:51:50,298
You should meet my friend,
Thackery.

716
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:51,802
He's nearly as mad as you.

717
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,664
Won't you join us for some tea?
Hatter, please.

718
00:51:54,114 --> 00:51:55,534
You must go back to your family.

719
00:51:57,617 --> 00:51:59,077
What do you know of my family?

720
00:51:59,244 --> 00:52:00,373
They're in danger.

721
00:52:00,829 --> 00:52:02,829
You have to warn them about
Horunvendush day.

722
00:52:03,748 --> 00:52:05,039
No idea what you're talking
about.

723
00:52:06,217 --> 00:52:09,458
But if my father sent you to
change my mind, you won't!

724
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:13,380
If you don't go now and reconcile,
you'll be sorry. I know you will.

725
00:52:14,885 --> 00:52:16,184
Maybe later.

726
00:52:18,012 --> 00:52:19,393
I lost my father.

727
00:52:21,266 --> 00:52:22,925
And I miss him every day.

728
00:52:25,561 --> 00:52:28,652
If you walk away now, you will
lose your father, too.

729
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:30,860
It's forever, for me.

730
00:52:31,318 --> 00:52:33,188
But it doesn't have to be
forever, for you.

731
00:52:33,778 --> 00:52:36,739
You can still get him back, and
then you'll really be you, again.

732
00:52:37,114 --> 00:52:38,985
And a hatter, just like him.

733
00:52:39,826 --> 00:52:43,786
The last thing I want is to end
up like my father.

734
00:52:50,003 --> 00:52:51,052
Tarrant, wait!

735
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:52,757
Your family will be lost...

736
00:52:52,856 --> 00:52:55,695
and you will have done nothing
to stop it!

737
00:52:58,262 --> 00:53:00,931
Fine.
I'll warn them myself.

738
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:12,230
Mr. Hightopp!

739
00:53:13,902 --> 00:53:15,492
If I could just have a moment
of your time.

740
00:53:15,653 --> 00:53:17,704
There's something terribly important
you should know about.

741
00:53:17,864 --> 00:53:19,244
Mr. Hightopp?

742
00:53:24,746 --> 00:53:26,076
Our apologies.

743
00:53:26,248 --> 00:53:28,945
You know of my sister's...
misfortune.

744
00:53:29,045 --> 00:53:31,708
No apologies necessary, your highness.

745
00:53:31,809 --> 00:53:35,842
All of Witzend laments the day
of your sister's accident.

746
00:53:35,916 --> 00:53:39,175
Fell day, as the clock struck 6.

747
00:53:40,371 --> 00:53:42,028
I shall never forget that snowy
night...

748
00:53:42,128 --> 00:53:44,411
when she hit her head in the
town square.

749
00:53:45,141 --> 00:53:46,231
She and I had...

750
00:53:50,396 --> 00:53:52,067
That moment changed everything.

751
00:53:53,525 --> 00:53:55,315
But if that moment never happened...

752
00:53:55,902 --> 00:53:58,112
there'd be no Horunvendush day.

753
00:53:58,614 --> 00:54:00,284
Hatter would be saved!

754
00:54:02,992 --> 00:54:04,623
Excuse me.

755
00:54:08,539 --> 00:54:10,079
Who was that strange girl?

756
00:54:30,436 --> 00:54:32,286
Oh, dear, oh dear, oh dear!

757
00:54:32,356 --> 00:54:35,396
Don't worry, men.
We can do this!

758
00:54:40,072 --> 00:54:42,121
Just not with him.

759
00:54:45,786 --> 00:54:46,996
Cheer up, Tarrant.

760
00:54:47,161 --> 00:54:49,831
We'll have fun now that you're
living here.

761
00:54:50,706 --> 00:54:52,246
It's tea time!

762
00:54:52,416 --> 00:54:56,496
Twinkle, twinkle little bat,
how I wonder where you're at.

763
00:54:56,672 --> 00:54:58,882
Up above the...

764
00:55:21,054 --> 00:55:25,389
Who's he?
Greetings, underlings.

765
00:55:25,534 --> 00:55:26,744
I am Time.

766
00:55:27,536 --> 00:55:28,996
The infinite and immortal.

767
00:55:29,496 --> 00:55:31,576
The personification of time,
itself.

768
00:55:31,956 --> 00:55:34,960
I know you may find this concept
a little bit hard to digest...

769
00:55:35,061 --> 00:55:38,420
but, please, keep your bewilderment
brief, and to the point.

770
00:55:38,922 --> 00:55:40,842
Your majesty.
Nice to meet you, sir.

771
00:55:43,594 --> 00:55:48,643
I seek a thief of meager intellect.

772
00:55:48,806 --> 00:55:49,717
Her hair...

773
00:55:50,099 --> 00:55:50,929
Yes?

774
00:55:51,309 --> 00:55:52,190
yellow-ish.

775
00:55:52,853 --> 00:55:53,853
Her name...

776
00:55:54,730 --> 00:55:55,730
Alice.

777
00:55:57,231 --> 00:55:59,532
And what is your business with her?

778
00:55:59,693 --> 00:56:01,242
She took something from me.

779
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:04,570
I will not say what it was.
It's not important.

780
00:56:04,947 --> 00:56:05,947
It is a trifle.

781
00:56:06,449 --> 00:56:08,489
I don't see why you are
making such a fuss.

782
00:56:10,077 --> 00:56:12,907
It is as nothing.
I must have it back.

783
00:56:13,956 --> 00:56:14,666
But not that I'm concerned.

784
00:56:16,001 --> 00:56:17,791
As soon as possible.

785
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:20,300
Either way, I'm fine with the
outcome.

786
00:56:21,215 --> 00:56:23,804
Give it to me.
Who knows about it?

787
00:56:30,224 --> 00:56:33,744
Well, you are in luck, oh, timely
one...

788
00:56:33,844 --> 00:56:36,380
because, just today...

789
00:56:36,481 --> 00:56:38,231
I invited Alice to tea.

790
00:56:38,731 --> 00:56:40,442
Wait. What's an Alice?
Shush!

791
00:56:41,108 --> 00:56:45,644
Why don't you have a seat, and
we can wait together.

792
00:56:45,744 --> 00:56:47,739
Yes!
There's no room at the table.

793
00:56:48,115 --> 00:56:50,235
No room.
No room.

794
00:56:51,536 --> 00:56:53,833
Plenty of room.
Plenty of room.

795
00:56:54,831 --> 00:56:57,132
Tea for our guest.
Tea time!

796
00:57:02,172 --> 00:57:04,342
We're having such a lovely
time, here.

797
00:57:06,635 --> 00:57:08,054
Would ya like a scone?

798
00:57:08,554 --> 00:57:10,063
Scone.

799
00:57:10,472 --> 00:57:11,891
No.
So...

800
00:57:12,391 --> 00:57:15,019
if you are really time itself...

801
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:17,516
yourself, or whatever suchness
you claim...

802
00:57:17,617 --> 00:57:20,228
Scone!
perhaps you can answer me this.

803
00:57:20,329 --> 00:57:23,938
I have always wondered when
"soon" is.

804
00:57:24,443 --> 00:57:28,873
If you vex me, it will be an
eternity.

805
00:57:31,284 --> 00:57:33,585
No, it's not fair!
It's not fair!

806
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:45,800
He really reminds me of someone.

807
00:57:46,382 --> 00:57:47,382
I can't think who.

808
00:57:48,385 --> 00:57:50,755
I think he looks a little bit
like you, brother.

809
00:57:51,722 --> 00:57:53,811
Nonsense!
He's hideous.

810
00:57:54,224 --> 00:57:55,483
He looks more like you.

811
00:57:55,976 --> 00:57:56,885
Come back!

812
00:57:57,603 --> 00:57:58,603
Hey, Tarrant?

813
00:57:58,978 --> 00:58:00,438
Tarrant, watch this.

814
00:58:00,981 --> 00:58:03,231
Now you see me.
Now you...

815
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,900
Wait a moment, wait a moment.
Oh, ah!

816
00:58:07,987 --> 00:58:09,447
Where'd the cat go?

817
00:58:11,782 --> 00:58:12,742
Gotcha!

818
00:58:14,244 --> 00:58:15,253
Have at you.

819
00:58:15,411 --> 00:58:17,371
Contrarywise, have at you.

820
00:58:26,590 --> 00:58:27,670
It's nearly 6.

821
00:58:32,387 --> 00:58:33,507
Hello.

822
00:58:34,056 --> 00:58:35,766
You have a very nice head.

823
00:58:36,307 --> 00:58:37,637
Thank you.

824
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:39,891
And a nice head deserves a very
nice hat.

825
00:58:40,311 --> 00:58:41,481
That's what my father says.

826
00:58:41,646 --> 00:58:43,856
He makes the best hats in
Witzend.

827
00:58:44,650 --> 00:58:45,980
Would you like him to make you
one?

828
00:58:49,278 --> 00:58:51,884
Come on.
He can make any hat...

829
00:58:51,983 --> 00:58:56,753
or bonnet, or boater, dunce hat,
fez, a cloche, coif, snood...

830
00:58:56,853 --> 00:58:58,932
barboosh, or pugree.

831
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:04,590
You're eating all the tarts.

832
00:59:05,003 --> 00:59:07,052
You can have the crusts.
I don't want the crusts.

833
00:59:07,213 --> 00:59:08,213
If you can't get along...

834
00:59:08,632 --> 00:59:09,922
there'll be no more tarts,
for either of you.

835
00:59:10,467 --> 00:59:11,586
Now, out of my kitchen.

836
00:59:14,346 --> 00:59:15,175
Scat!

837
00:59:20,686 --> 00:59:22,846
Is it true that you heal all
wounds?

838
00:59:23,313 --> 00:59:25,072
Time is on my side.

839
00:59:25,231 --> 00:59:27,862
And why is it you wait for no
man?

840
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:30,110
I just can't find the time.

841
00:59:31,697 --> 00:59:32,697
Chessur...

842
00:59:33,239 --> 00:59:34,280
where have you been?
You're late.

843
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:39,001
Actually, I'm right on Time.

844
00:59:41,789 --> 00:59:43,603
I've got time on my hands.

845
00:59:43,704 --> 00:59:47,460
Do you silly nitwits...

846
00:59:48,012 --> 00:59:50,224
really think that I have not
heard...

847
00:59:50,324 --> 00:59:54,460
these cheap barbs before? Your
attempts at mockery fall flat.

848
00:59:54,635 --> 00:59:56,663
Look, look.
Time is flying.

849
00:59:56,762 --> 00:59:58,432
Enough!

850
01:00:00,067 --> 01:00:00,976
No more wasting Me.

851
01:00:01,143 --> 01:00:03,523
I'm having the time of my life?

852
01:00:05,608 --> 01:00:07,173
No?

853
01:00:11,045 --> 01:00:13,762
Father, look.
A customer with a lovely head...

854
01:00:13,862 --> 01:00:15,396
right here.

855
01:00:18,492 --> 01:00:20,702
What is the hat of your
heart's desire, madam?

856
01:00:20,871 --> 01:00:22,041
Something...

857
01:00:22,371 --> 01:00:23,501
feathery?

858
01:00:23,706 --> 01:00:24,867
Something...

859
01:00:25,208 --> 01:00:25,918
button-y?

860
01:00:27,878 --> 01:00:29,338
Good afternoon, Miss.

861
01:00:29,922 --> 01:00:31,012
Good afternoon, sir.

862
01:00:31,172 --> 01:00:32,974
The function of a hat...

863
01:00:33,074 --> 01:00:36,478
is to follow the proper dictum
of society.

864
01:00:37,054 --> 01:00:38,724
Not to be fun.

865
01:00:38,889 --> 01:00:39,889
Father...

866
01:00:40,641 --> 01:00:42,811
I have something fun.

867
01:00:45,478 --> 01:00:46,518
What is it?

868
01:00:47,606 --> 01:00:48,936
It's a hat.

869
01:00:49,182 --> 01:00:50,983
Tarrant, you've got it on
backwards.

870
01:00:52,693 --> 01:00:54,653
Stop, you'll ruin it.
Let me finish.

871
01:00:58,108 --> 01:01:00,117
Oh, dear.

872
01:01:00,284 --> 01:01:01,405
Oh, well...

873
01:01:01,911 --> 01:01:02,867
tomorrow...

874
01:01:03,713 --> 01:01:06,336
I'll show you precisely how
to make a proper hat.

875
01:01:13,923 --> 01:01:15,134
Tarrant?

876
01:01:16,592 --> 01:01:18,393
You're too hard on him, Zanik.

877
01:01:19,012 --> 01:01:20,512
Hatting is a serious business.

878
01:01:21,139 --> 01:01:25,309
I can't have his frivolous ideas
keep him from his true potential.

879
01:01:28,146 --> 01:01:28,896
Now...

880
01:01:30,190 --> 01:01:31,360
yes...

881
01:01:32,025 --> 01:01:34,735
Yes, I think this hat will suit
you...

882
01:01:37,322 --> 01:01:38,056
perfectly.

883
01:01:38,155 --> 01:01:39,626
Thank you ever so much,
Mr. Hightopp...

884
01:01:39,726 --> 01:01:41,625
although, I really must be on
my way.

885
01:01:42,034 --> 01:01:43,614
Have a lovely evening!

886
01:01:52,045 --> 01:01:53,545
Where is she?

887
01:02:21,949 --> 01:02:22,949
What are you doing?

888
01:02:23,367 --> 01:02:24,827
Nothing.

889
01:02:30,333 --> 01:02:31,844
When is she coming?

890
01:02:36,882 --> 01:02:38,472
Well...

891
01:02:38,884 --> 01:02:43,139
I never actually said she was
coming, old bean.

892
01:02:43,239 --> 01:02:46,030
I merely said I had invited her.

893
01:02:49,811 --> 01:02:51,440
Very good.
Very clever.

894
01:02:52,146 --> 01:02:53,356
Well played, sir.

895
01:02:53,856 --> 01:02:54,686
Well played.

896
01:02:54,858 --> 01:02:56,027
Thank you.

897
01:02:56,126 --> 01:02:58,856
You were asking me before,
when "soon", is?

898
01:02:59,028 --> 01:03:01,528
Let me try to explain when is,
now, all right?

899
01:03:03,407 --> 01:03:04,657
Now is...

900
01:03:05,284 --> 01:03:08,324
Exactly one minute till tea
time.

901
01:03:08,871 --> 01:03:12,422
And until the young Alice joins
you for tea...

902
01:03:12,583 --> 01:03:16,503
it will always remain one minute
till tea time...

903
01:03:16,922 --> 01:03:18,472
For you and your...

904
01:03:18,965 --> 01:03:20,545
Dunderheads.

905
01:03:21,050 --> 01:03:21,891
Watch it!

906
01:03:23,512 --> 01:03:24,931
Enjoy the present.

907
01:03:25,304 --> 01:03:26,465
I've seen him in his true light
now, haven't I?

908
01:03:27,932 --> 01:03:29,023
Time to go.

909
01:03:29,226 --> 01:03:30,346
I must get the Chronosphere back.

910
01:03:30,768 --> 01:03:32,728
She cannot be far away.

911
01:03:33,605 --> 01:03:34,514
What a curious chap.

912
01:03:34,690 --> 01:03:35,690
What a gentleman.

913
01:03:36,065 --> 01:03:37,106
Bye bye.

914
01:03:42,072 --> 01:03:44,802
I can't believe he just said that.
Can you?

915
01:03:52,583 --> 01:03:53,922
I can't believe he just said that.

916
01:03:55,460 --> 01:03:57,786
What?
Can't bloody move.

917
01:03:57,885 --> 01:03:59,663
Wait!
What's he done?

918
01:03:59,715 --> 01:04:03,224
The blighter's stuck us all
at one minute to tea time.

919
01:04:10,057 --> 01:04:12,728
Tea time forever!

920
01:04:18,733 --> 01:04:20,244
Here you are, little ants.

921
01:04:20,402 --> 01:04:21,862
A nice new home.

922
01:04:30,036 --> 01:04:31,746
What did I tell you two?

923
01:04:32,164 --> 01:04:34,003
No more tarts.

924
01:04:34,166 --> 01:04:35,416
I didn't eat any tarts.

925
01:04:38,628 --> 01:04:39,798
Why are these crusts under your bed?

926
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:45,760
She put them there.

927
01:04:48,054 --> 01:04:49,355
Did you, Mirana?

928
01:04:49,847 --> 01:04:51,557
You did.
Tell her!

929
01:04:52,351 --> 01:04:53,851
Tell the truth, Mirana.

930
01:04:54,393 --> 01:04:56,813
Did you eat the tarts and put
the crusts there?

931
01:05:03,237 --> 01:05:04,237
No.

932
01:05:05,155 --> 01:05:07,065
But you did!
You're lying!

933
01:05:08,659 --> 01:05:09,949
The tarts are under your bed.

934
01:05:11,911 --> 01:05:13,161
Don't blame your sister.

935
01:05:13,996 --> 01:05:16,496
No, it's not fair!
It's not fair!

936
01:05:31,806 --> 01:05:33,637
The stroke of 6!

937
01:05:43,318 --> 01:05:44,777
The clock.

938
01:05:44,945 --> 01:05:46,114
She'll hit her head!

939
01:06:06,132 --> 01:06:07,132
No!

940
01:06:12,514 --> 01:06:13,724
My head.

941
01:06:15,516 --> 01:06:17,016
Stupid roses.

942
01:06:19,521 --> 01:06:20,521
The Princess.

943
01:06:20,688 --> 01:06:21,938
Oh, no.

944
01:06:29,907 --> 01:06:30,947
Is your head all right, miss?

945
01:06:31,365 --> 01:06:33,025
Careful. It's swelling up.

946
01:06:34,119 --> 01:06:35,159
Oh, no.

947
01:06:36,204 --> 01:06:37,545
Iracebeth?

948
01:06:38,081 --> 01:06:40,226
Iracebeth!
Where is she?

949
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:43,760
Oh, my darling!

950
01:06:44,338 --> 01:06:46,809
Arms around my neck.
Daddy, my head hurts!

951
01:06:50,344 --> 01:06:51,724
Mirana!

952
01:06:52,929 --> 01:06:54,389
Did you see that?

953
01:06:54,556 --> 01:06:56,726
Yes.
That's a nasty fall.

954
01:07:01,938 --> 01:07:03,938
You cannot change the past.

955
01:07:04,106 --> 01:07:06,567
Though I dare say, you might
learn something from it.

956
01:07:15,744 --> 01:07:18,003
The first hat I ever made.

957
01:07:19,121 --> 01:07:22,172
I thought I'd tossed it away
long, long ago.

958
01:07:23,001 --> 01:07:24,710
He kept it.

959
01:07:24,878 --> 01:07:27,958
It's impossible for it to be here,
and yet...

960
01:07:28,130 --> 01:07:30,050
here it is!

961
01:07:30,192 --> 01:07:32,320
So, if this hat survived...

962
01:07:32,420 --> 01:07:35,166
then my family must have, too.

963
01:07:35,972 --> 01:07:36,893
Higgens.

964
01:07:37,641 --> 01:07:39,311
Highbottom.

965
01:07:39,476 --> 01:07:41,096
Not here, yet.

966
01:07:41,269 --> 01:07:42,900
No Hightopps.

967
01:07:44,856 --> 01:07:46,896
They're alive.

968
01:07:47,067 --> 01:07:48,527
They're alive!

969
01:07:53,782 --> 01:07:55,492
Your foolishness...

970
01:07:56,117 --> 01:07:57,327
astounds me.

971
01:07:57,869 --> 01:08:02,119
You have no conception of how
reckless...

972
01:08:02,666 --> 01:08:04,480
you have been.

973
01:08:04,579 --> 01:08:08,539
The dangers that you have
caused.

974
01:08:20,225 --> 01:08:21,614
What are we going to do?

975
01:08:21,715 --> 01:08:24,994
Quick! Where's the manual?
Who's got the manual?

976
01:08:42,456 --> 01:08:45,626
I need that chronosphere now.

977
01:08:46,210 --> 01:08:48,573
It must go back to the Grand
Clock.

978
01:08:48,936 --> 01:08:49,783
But, Horunvendush day.

979
01:08:50,213 --> 01:08:52,423
I'll only use it one more time.

980
01:08:52,591 --> 01:08:54,434
I must find out what happened
to the Hightopps...

981
01:08:54,533 --> 01:08:55,498
so, I can rescue them.

982
01:08:55,533 --> 01:09:00,426
You will rescue no one.
Wherever you go, I will find you.

983
01:09:00,599 --> 01:09:03,349
The Grand Clock must not stop!

984
01:09:03,976 --> 01:09:07,476
You cannot escape Time!

985
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:10,150
I'm sorry...

986
01:09:11,609 --> 01:09:13,279
but I must save Hatter.

987
01:09:19,993 --> 01:09:22,122
Alice?
Alice!

988
01:09:22,287 --> 01:09:24,457
Come back with my Chronosphere...

989
01:09:24,622 --> 01:09:26,422
It's the Kingsleigh girl!

990
01:09:26,582 --> 01:09:28,212
The girl's gone mad.
Take her away.

991
01:09:28,377 --> 01:09:30,377
Strap her down, lads.

992
01:09:32,171 --> 01:09:34,091
Alice?

993
01:09:34,466 --> 01:09:35,796
Alice?

994
01:09:39,762 --> 01:09:41,222
Alice?

995
01:09:46,728 --> 01:09:47,648
Where am I?

996
01:09:49,355 --> 01:09:51,105
You're in an institution.

997
01:09:51,274 --> 01:09:52,654
How long have I been here?

998
01:09:52,818 --> 01:09:53,858
Not long.

999
01:09:54,862 --> 01:09:58,162
You were found in an upstairs
room, at the Ascots'.

1000
01:09:58,865 --> 01:10:00,945
Hamish had you brought here.

1001
01:10:01,451 --> 01:10:03,621
You were behaving so strangely.

1002
01:10:10,085 --> 01:10:13,704
They say you were trying to
get under the furniture.

1003
01:10:14,213 --> 01:10:15,884
Talking about the atmosphere?

1004
01:10:18,176 --> 01:10:20,396
The Chronosphere!
Hatter!

1005
01:10:20,497 --> 01:10:23,744
Yes indeed, Miss Kingsleigh.
I've got to go back.

1006
01:10:23,815 --> 01:10:24,926
Let us see.

1007
01:10:25,434 --> 01:10:26,274
Excitable...

1008
01:10:26,810 --> 01:10:29,270
emotional, prone to fantasy.

1009
01:10:30,354 --> 01:10:32,064
Textbook case of female hysteria.

1010
01:10:32,649 --> 01:10:34,979
Untreatable, some say.

1011
01:10:37,404 --> 01:10:39,663
I beg to differ.

1012
01:10:39,823 --> 01:10:41,703
But there's nothing wrong
with me.

1013
01:10:42,201 --> 01:10:42,990
Lie back, Alice.

1014
01:10:43,534 --> 01:10:44,534
Lie back.

1015
01:10:46,204 --> 01:10:47,979
Dr. Bennet, is it really necessary?

1016
01:10:48,078 --> 01:10:49,865
Surely there must be some...
Mr. Harris?

1017
01:10:50,708 --> 01:10:52,503
I can't be here!
Mr. Harris, if you could see...

1018
01:10:52,604 --> 01:10:54,462
to Mrs. Kingsleigh?
I've got to go back!

1019
01:10:56,006 --> 01:10:57,216
We have work to do.

1020
01:10:57,716 --> 01:11:00,926
Never fear. We'll have Alice
fixed, in no time.

1021
01:11:06,015 --> 01:11:07,345
Where did I...

1022
01:11:15,692 --> 01:11:17,192
Dr. Bennet, I really must object!

1023
01:11:19,195 --> 01:11:20,557
Alice...

1024
01:11:22,032 --> 01:11:22,872
Run!

1025
01:11:25,159 --> 01:11:25,989
No!

1026
01:11:26,619 --> 01:11:28,329
Don't let her get away!
Hurry!

1027
01:11:59,319 --> 01:12:01,519
If three years at sea taught
me anything...

1028
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:04,314
it's how to tie a bloody good
knot.

1029
01:12:16,962 --> 01:12:17,712
Hey!

1030
01:12:18,130 --> 01:12:19,550
That's my cab!

1031
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:22,010
You can't take that!

1032
01:12:22,176 --> 01:12:23,256
Sorry!

1033
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:25,600
I plead insanity.

1034
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:42,951
Hold on, Hightopps.

1035
01:13:42,171 --> 01:13:43,171
Hightopps!

1036
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:57,350
No!

1037
01:14:25,381 --> 01:14:27,761
Revenge is mine.

1038
01:14:28,844 --> 01:14:30,304
She took them.

1039
01:14:48,738 --> 01:14:50,238
Next time.

1040
01:15:02,586 --> 01:15:03,956
Hatter!

1041
01:15:05,671 --> 01:15:06,591
Hatter...

1042
01:15:07,131 --> 01:15:08,261
your family, they're alive!

1043
01:15:28,278 --> 01:15:30,448
He's barely ticking.

1044
01:15:31,155 --> 01:15:32,405
I fear you are too late.

1045
01:15:35,034 --> 01:15:36,034
Hatter!

1046
01:15:38,546 --> 01:15:40,167
He's fading away.

1047
01:15:40,791 --> 01:15:43,341
I can't bear to see him like this.

1048
01:15:43,961 --> 01:15:48,211
Come, Mally.
Say your goodbyes, Alice.

1049
01:15:48,881 --> 01:15:50,820
Come on.
Yeah.

1050
01:15:54,136 --> 01:15:57,016
Please wake up, hatter. Please.

1051
01:15:57,181 --> 01:15:58,481
Wake up!

1052
01:15:58,975 --> 01:16:00,555
Please, wake up!

1053
01:16:08,150 --> 01:16:09,740
I know what this means, now.

1054
01:16:10,529 --> 01:16:12,859
You made it for your father,
when you were young.

1055
01:16:13,323 --> 01:16:16,203
A token of your love, which you
thought he threw away.

1056
01:16:16,784 --> 01:16:18,654
But he kept it, all those years.

1057
01:16:18,828 --> 01:16:20,158
He kept it!

1058
01:16:20,329 --> 01:16:22,000
And now he needs your help.

1059
01:16:25,377 --> 01:16:27,337
I'm so sorry.

1060
01:16:27,503 --> 01:16:28,963
I thought it was impossible.

1061
01:16:32,842 --> 01:16:34,893
I should have believed you.

1062
01:16:44,688 --> 01:16:46,768
You believe me?

1063
01:16:54,189 --> 01:16:56,198
I'll always believe in you.

1064
01:17:04,248 --> 01:17:07,088
It's you, isn't it?

1065
01:17:10,713 --> 01:17:13,054
I'd know you anywhere.

1066
01:17:20,556 --> 01:17:22,056
You're Alice.

1067
01:17:22,643 --> 01:17:23,603
Hatter...

1068
01:17:24,895 --> 01:17:26,604
I missed you so much.

1069
01:17:26,771 --> 01:17:28,402
So have I, dear.

1070
01:17:31,443 --> 01:17:34,453
But if my family's still alive...

1071
01:17:34,613 --> 01:17:36,573
why have they not come home?

1072
01:17:37,114 --> 01:17:38,693
Because they are being held
captive...

1073
01:17:38,792 --> 01:17:41,087
by the only person cruel enough
to keep them locked up...

1074
01:17:41,186 --> 01:17:42,974
all these years.

1075
01:17:54,423 --> 01:17:56,264
Bloody big head.

1076
01:18:00,096 --> 01:18:06,029
I'm going to find that red queen
and bring my family home.

1077
01:18:17,447 --> 01:18:18,617
Hello!

1078
01:18:18,782 --> 01:18:19,912
What do you think, pets?

1079
01:18:21,409 --> 01:18:24,119
Oh, dig, dig, dig.
Work, work, work.

1080
01:18:27,623 --> 01:18:28,793
Earthquake.

1081
01:18:41,054 --> 01:18:42,394
Where the devil have you been?

1082
01:18:43,306 --> 01:18:44,466
Where's Alice?

1083
01:18:44,891 --> 01:18:45,981
Where's my Chronosphere?

1084
01:18:48,478 --> 01:18:50,978
She jumped into a looking glass.

1085
01:18:51,439 --> 01:18:52,189
She's gone.

1086
01:18:52,356 --> 01:18:54,643
What?
You let her get away?

1087
01:18:54,743 --> 01:18:57,793
No, I... I must find her.

1088
01:18:57,894 --> 01:19:00,027
Where is she?
How should I know where she is?

1089
01:19:00,198 --> 01:19:02,029
Cause she is your enemy.

1090
01:19:02,658 --> 01:19:04,158
She muttered...

1091
01:19:04,786 --> 01:19:06,286
an utterance about...

1092
01:19:06,872 --> 01:19:07,872
Hightopps.

1093
01:19:08,497 --> 01:19:09,828
Hightopps...

1094
01:19:11,167 --> 01:19:13,548
She said she was going to rescue
them.

1095
01:19:13,649 --> 01:19:15,671
What could this mean?

1096
01:19:17,498 --> 01:19:19,759
I know exactly what that means.

1097
01:19:22,887 --> 01:19:25,398
Guards?
Seize him!

1098
01:19:27,184 --> 01:19:29,694
You see, from now on, dearest...

1099
01:19:29,853 --> 01:19:31,483
I'm in charge.

1100
01:19:37,819 --> 01:19:39,319
I've fallen off!

1101
01:19:57,421 --> 01:19:59,171
Alice...

1102
01:19:59,675 --> 01:20:01,265
Mirana...

1103
01:20:11,435 --> 01:20:14,185
My family's there.
I know it!

1104
01:20:23,698 --> 01:20:26,908
Good heavens!
Which way is up?

1105
01:20:27,043 --> 01:20:28,243
Oh, there's a lot of stairs.

1106
01:20:28,770 --> 01:20:31,345
Is this where we, uh...
Split up!

1107
01:20:31,707 --> 01:20:33,327
We'll split up together.

1108
01:20:33,833 --> 01:20:35,594
It is a very large castle.

1109
01:20:36,028 --> 01:20:37,797
Perhaps if we don't split up?

1110
01:20:38,137 --> 01:20:39,068
Oh, dear...

1111
01:20:39,167 --> 01:20:40,898
I'm out of breath, already.

1112
01:20:40,932 --> 01:20:42,377
Mrs. Hightopp?

1113
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:46,300
Hightopps?
Hightopps?

1114
01:20:47,055 --> 01:20:48,765
Zoinks!

1115
01:20:52,644 --> 01:20:55,661
This one's locked.
This one, too!

1116
01:21:00,109 --> 01:21:01,239
This is the last room.

1117
01:21:01,403 --> 01:21:02,953
They must be this way.

1118
01:21:03,363 --> 01:21:05,122
I just know it.

1119
01:21:12,956 --> 01:21:14,615
Father?
Mother?

1120
01:21:15,458 --> 01:21:16,998
Anyone?

1121
01:21:29,264 --> 01:21:30,274
They're not here?

1122
01:21:35,479 --> 01:21:36,809
They're not here.

1123
01:21:39,483 --> 01:21:40,533
They're not here.

1124
01:21:44,445 --> 01:21:48,485
But I was certain that they were
here. I... I could feel it.

1125
01:21:55,289 --> 01:21:57,000
I'm so sorry.

1126
01:22:21,859 --> 01:22:22,979
Father?

1127
01:22:23,150 --> 01:22:24,110
Mother!

1128
01:22:24,694 --> 01:22:26,204
Everyone, it's you!

1129
01:22:30,908 --> 01:22:33,948
Teeny-tiny you, but still you.

1130
01:22:49,136 --> 01:22:49,836
Hello, Alice.

1131
01:22:52,430 --> 01:22:54,060
Get it!

1132
01:22:56,894 --> 01:22:58,024
No!

1133
01:23:00,771 --> 01:23:01,771
Thank you, ever so much.

1134
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:06,497
You have just delivered to me...

1135
01:23:06,766 --> 01:23:11,673
the most powerful device in
the entire universe.

1136
01:23:12,909 --> 01:23:15,079
Along with your dearest friends.

1137
01:23:15,537 --> 01:23:19,167
And my dearest enemy.

1138
01:23:23,795 --> 01:23:25,889
Racie!
Shut up!

1139
01:23:28,207 --> 01:23:30,545
I knew we should have stayed
together. Now, look at us.

1140
01:23:30,645 --> 01:23:33,502
Stuck in a giant vegetable jail.

1141
01:23:37,809 --> 01:23:39,189
What happened to you?

1142
01:23:45,359 --> 01:23:47,279
Wait!
Your majesty, stop!

1143
01:23:47,444 --> 01:23:50,113
You cannot change the past.
Believe me, I have tried.

1144
01:23:50,697 --> 01:23:52,353
Oh, Alice, you always were an
irksome...

1145
01:23:52,453 --> 01:23:55,069
slurvish, interrupting thing.

1146
01:23:55,170 --> 01:23:56,171
When I get back...

1147
01:23:56,286 --> 01:23:58,576
I shall have the heads of all
your friends.

1148
01:23:58,747 --> 01:24:01,077
And then I shall have your head.
Ta-ta.

1149
01:24:04,795 --> 01:24:05,925
Come on.

1150
01:24:06,505 --> 01:24:07,965
Don't let her see herself...

1151
01:24:08,548 --> 01:24:09,969
or else she will destroy everything!

1152
01:24:20,810 --> 01:24:23,560
I now recall why I don't like
her.

1153
01:24:35,826 --> 01:24:38,365
"How to keep the clock going,
yourself."

1154
01:24:38,996 --> 01:24:39,945
Of course!

1155
01:24:40,622 --> 01:24:42,703
Seconds, minutes...

1156
01:24:42,804 --> 01:24:45,672
proceed to 347!

1157
01:24:47,587 --> 01:24:49,765
It's time...

1158
01:24:50,087 --> 01:24:51,837
for...

1159
01:24:51,984 --> 01:24:54,332
ze hour!

1160
01:25:10,152 --> 01:25:11,072
It's time.

1161
01:25:12,029 --> 01:25:14,109
Oh, this is all my fault.

1162
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:15,780
I stole the Chronosphere.

1163
01:25:19,060 --> 01:25:20,791
I think you may have to steal
it again.

1164
01:25:29,796 --> 01:25:31,506
She ate my schnozzle.

1165
01:25:34,676 --> 01:25:36,046
And my fingers.

1166
01:25:36,220 --> 01:25:37,680
And my elbow!

1167
01:25:38,721 --> 01:25:40,021
Thank you!

1168
01:25:40,599 --> 01:25:43,019
I think you look rather fetching
without your schnozzle.

1169
01:25:44,019 --> 01:25:45,849
Absolutely radishing.

1170
01:25:46,646 --> 01:25:47,806
Oh, stop it!

1171
01:25:48,157 --> 01:25:49,436
What are we going to do?

1172
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:50,979
Yeah, what's the plan?

1173
01:25:54,195 --> 01:25:57,115
It's up to you now, Alice.

1174
01:25:59,659 --> 01:26:01,079
Take Time to his castle.

1175
01:26:01,453 --> 01:26:03,332
Hatter and I will retrieve the
chronosphere...

1176
01:26:03,497 --> 01:26:05,905
and restore order to the universe.
Do you understand?

1177
01:26:06,006 --> 01:26:07,416
Yes, of course, of course!
Got it.

1178
01:26:07,917 --> 01:26:09,787
What are you waiting, for?
Let's go!

1179
01:26:19,387 --> 01:26:20,307
Where are we?

1180
01:26:20,764 --> 01:26:22,854
You know where we are.

1181
01:26:25,935 --> 01:26:27,595
Why are these crusts under
your bed?

1182
01:26:30,731 --> 01:26:31,612
She put them there.

1183
01:26:33,609 --> 01:26:35,250
Did you, Mirana?

1184
01:26:35,570 --> 01:26:37,451
Did you, Mirana?

1185
01:26:38,198 --> 01:26:39,118
You did.

1186
01:26:39,615 --> 01:26:40,775
Tell her!

1187
01:26:41,243 --> 01:26:42,122
Tell the truth, Mirana.

1188
01:26:43,453 --> 01:26:45,752
Did you eat the tarts, and put
the crusts there?

1189
01:26:49,792 --> 01:26:50,792
No.
No.

1190
01:26:54,297 --> 01:26:55,797
Racie, no!
You're a liar!

1191
01:26:56,216 --> 01:26:57,796
Liar!
You're lying!

1192
01:27:18,654 --> 01:27:21,654
This cannot be good.

1193
01:27:32,668 --> 01:27:33,798
We've got to go, now!

1194
01:27:39,009 --> 01:27:41,179
She has broken the past.

1195
01:27:41,619 --> 01:27:44,760
Only putting back the Chronosphere
can save us, now!

1196
01:28:11,207 --> 01:28:12,287
It's catching up!

1197
01:29:04,094 --> 01:29:05,264
Alice?

1198
01:29:05,429 --> 01:29:07,259
Hold on, everyone.

1199
01:29:07,639 --> 01:29:08,719
I don't wanna hold on!

1200
01:29:16,439 --> 01:29:17,770
Ze Chronosphere!

1201
01:29:18,242 --> 01:29:20,282
She brought it back!

1202
01:29:38,503 --> 01:29:39,753
Run, Alice!

1203
01:29:40,096 --> 01:29:41,627
They might actually pull this off.

1204
01:29:43,966 --> 01:29:45,837
Follow me.
This way!

1205
01:29:46,502 --> 01:29:48,302
I've got you, wee man.

1206
01:29:54,019 --> 01:29:56,519
Tick-tock, tick-tock.
Gotta save the Grand Clock.

1207
01:30:01,944 --> 01:30:03,194
I won't leave you!

1208
01:30:10,618 --> 01:30:13,328
Sir, sir! Hold on, sir!
She's here!

1209
01:30:13,630 --> 01:30:16,789
Ze girl who tricked you, und
made you look a complete idiot!

1210
01:30:27,226 --> 01:30:28,846
Alice!

1211
01:30:29,846 --> 01:30:30,806
Hatter!

1212
01:30:46,822 --> 01:30:50,699
Goodbye, brother.
Brother, goodbye.

1213
01:30:51,201 --> 01:30:54,581
I have cherished every moment
with all of you.

1214
01:30:57,916 --> 01:30:59,246
On guard!

1215
01:31:00,551 --> 01:31:01,841
Time's up.

1216
01:31:04,631 --> 01:31:06,171
Oh, she's not going to make it!

1217
01:31:06,632 --> 01:31:08,512
She needs more time, sir!

1218
01:31:08,676 --> 01:31:13,466
I have not ticked my last tock,
yet!

1219
01:31:22,983 --> 01:31:24,033
It appears...

1220
01:31:24,568 --> 01:31:26,568
that my invincible machine...

1221
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:30,740
is in fact...

1222
01:31:31,533 --> 01:31:32,912
vincible.

1223
01:32:53,698 --> 01:32:55,738
My goodness.

1224
01:33:07,212 --> 01:33:09,631
Did I miss anything?

1225
01:33:12,341 --> 01:33:13,641
Are you all right?

1226
01:33:15,429 --> 01:33:16,548
Yes.

1227
01:33:17,055 --> 01:33:18,005
Wilkins?

1228
01:33:18,181 --> 01:33:19,181
Wilkins!

1229
01:33:19,640 --> 01:33:22,475
Wilkins!
Yes, sir?

1230
01:33:22,510 --> 01:33:23,481
Oh!
There you are.

1231
01:33:23,979 --> 01:33:25,269
Stop standing around.

1232
01:33:25,572 --> 01:33:27,152
There is much to do.

1233
01:33:28,859 --> 01:33:30,319
You don't need a butler, do you,
miss?

1234
01:33:31,194 --> 01:33:31,954
Wilkins!

1235
01:33:34,198 --> 01:33:36,488
They did it!
They did it!

1236
01:33:36,658 --> 01:33:39,908
Hooray, Alice!
Oh, I always liked that girl.

1237
01:33:47,627 --> 01:33:49,337
Get off me!

1238
01:34:05,895 --> 01:34:11,065
Why does this always happen
to me?

1239
01:34:21,078 --> 01:34:23,828
Why does no one love me?

1240
01:34:26,582 --> 01:34:28,042
I love you, Racie.

1241
01:34:29,086 --> 01:34:30,416
No, you don't!

1242
01:34:33,256 --> 01:34:35,966
This is all your fault!

1243
01:34:38,302 --> 01:34:39,262
I know.

1244
01:34:39,930 --> 01:34:42,600
I ate the tarts and I lied about it.

1245
01:34:42,765 --> 01:34:43,969
I should have just told the
truth...

1246
01:34:44,069 --> 01:34:46,740
and none of this would have
ever happened.

1247
01:34:47,311 --> 01:34:48,692
I'm so sorry.

1248
01:34:51,733 --> 01:34:54,243
If it's not too late...

1249
01:34:55,945 --> 01:34:57,945
Please forgive me.

1250
01:35:03,119 --> 01:35:05,289
That's all I ever wanted to
hear.

1251
01:35:07,373 --> 01:35:08,293
Really, it was.

1252
01:35:14,590 --> 01:35:16,590
Your majesty...

1253
01:35:17,176 --> 01:35:19,296
I do beg pardon for any intrusion.

1254
01:35:23,472 --> 01:35:24,813
My family find themselves...

1255
01:35:26,059 --> 01:35:27,639
in somewhat awkward circumstances.

1256
01:35:30,104 --> 01:35:31,055
Of course.

1257
01:35:34,193 --> 01:35:35,693
I always liked tiny things.

1258
01:35:38,322 --> 01:35:39,952
Thank you.

1259
01:35:45,529 --> 01:35:47,328
Not too much, now.
Be careful.

1260
01:35:58,675 --> 01:36:01,465
Outstanding, my boy.
Well done.

1261
01:36:02,512 --> 01:36:04,722
Oh, my family.

1262
01:36:06,057 --> 01:36:08,307
My dear family.

1263
01:36:08,851 --> 01:36:10,021
Mother!

1264
01:36:12,314 --> 01:36:14,524
You... father.

1265
01:36:16,150 --> 01:36:18,701
You kept my blue hat.

1266
01:36:20,363 --> 01:36:22,373
I make hats, father.

1267
01:36:24,243 --> 01:36:25,412
I'm a hatter.

1268
01:36:26,328 --> 01:36:29,408
I always knew you were, my boy.

1269
01:36:43,886 --> 01:36:45,056
All is well.

1270
01:36:47,224 --> 01:36:48,064
Yes?

1271
01:36:49,475 --> 01:36:51,386
I know you tried to warn me...

1272
01:36:51,561 --> 01:36:52,652
but I didn't listen.

1273
01:36:53,020 --> 01:36:54,900
I'm sorry.

1274
01:36:56,358 --> 01:36:58,398
You see, I used to think time
was a thief...

1275
01:36:59,403 --> 01:37:01,404
stealing everything I loved.

1276
01:37:02,528 --> 01:37:04,349
But, I...

1277
01:37:04,448 --> 01:37:07,622
I see now that you give, before
you take...

1278
01:37:08,125 --> 01:37:10,097
and every day is a gift.

1279
01:37:10,198 --> 01:37:12,997
Every hour, every minute, every
second.

1280
01:37:17,951 --> 01:37:19,002
Ah...

1281
01:37:19,137 --> 01:37:20,756
the fallen soldier.

1282
01:37:20,923 --> 01:37:22,554
I suppose you want me to fix it.

1283
01:37:23,594 --> 01:37:24,724
No.

1284
01:37:24,886 --> 01:37:26,096
I want you to have it.

1285
01:37:31,225 --> 01:37:33,725
He used to say the only thing
worth doing...

1286
01:37:33,895 --> 01:37:35,015
was what we do for others.

1287
01:37:38,274 --> 01:37:39,734
I think he would have liked you.

1288
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:46,912
Tis said, that time is a friend
to no man...

1289
01:37:48,952 --> 01:37:51,162
but I will remember you always.

1290
01:37:53,207 --> 01:37:54,117
And please...

1291
01:37:55,208 --> 01:37:56,288
do not come back.

1292
01:38:03,550 --> 01:38:04,550
Alice!

1293
01:38:04,967 --> 01:38:05,797
Oh, Alice...

1294
01:38:05,969 --> 01:38:09,127
you simply must come and meet
my family. I mean, after al...

1295
01:38:09,226 --> 01:38:12,560
you are the very person who saved
them, aren't you?

1296
01:38:12,695 --> 01:38:15,059
We're going to have so much fun
together.

1297
01:38:25,488 --> 01:38:27,655
But, of course, you have a family
of your own...

1298
01:38:27,756 --> 01:38:29,430
don't you?

1299
01:38:30,743 --> 01:38:33,663
Very important thing, a family.

1300
01:38:34,997 --> 01:38:36,747
You only get the one.

1301
01:38:38,585 --> 01:38:40,744
Oh, Hatter.

1302
01:38:40,921 --> 01:38:42,841
I fear I may never see you again.

1303
01:38:45,926 --> 01:38:47,336
My dear Alice.

1304
01:38:52,557 --> 01:38:54,637
In the gardens of memory...

1305
01:38:57,436 --> 01:38:59,726
in the palace of dreams...

1306
01:39:01,149 --> 01:39:03,899
that is where you and I will
meet.

1307
01:39:04,903 --> 01:39:07,203
But a dream is not reality.

1308
01:39:12,869 --> 01:39:15,750
Who's to say which is which?

1309
01:39:39,854 --> 01:39:41,404
You did it, Alice.

1310
01:39:41,981 --> 01:39:43,572
An impossible thing.

1311
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:47,820
Not as impossible as saying goodbye
to you, my friends.

1312
01:39:52,618 --> 01:39:54,037
Goodbye, Hatter.

1313
01:40:05,087 --> 01:40:07,717
Goodbye, Alice...

1314
01:40:14,347 --> 01:40:16,847
Now, please.
The deed to your husband's ship.

1315
01:40:17,475 --> 01:40:19,185
Just sign here...

1316
01:40:19,685 --> 01:40:20,555
and the house is yours.

1317
01:40:30,363 --> 01:40:33,627
Mr. Harcourt, time is money.

1318
01:40:34,868 --> 01:40:36,828
I'm afraid he most certainly,
is not.

1319
01:40:37,954 --> 01:40:38,835
Alice!

1320
01:40:39,288 --> 01:40:42,378
Time is many things, Hamish,
but he isn't money.

1321
01:40:44,545 --> 01:40:46,722
Nor is he our enemy, mother.

1322
01:40:47,631 --> 01:40:48,761
Where did you come from?

1323
01:40:49,466 --> 01:40:51,626
I walked right through the walls.

1324
01:40:56,890 --> 01:41:00,791
I may not be able to change the
past, but I can learn from it.

1325
01:41:01,302 --> 01:41:02,813
Sign the papers, mother.

1326
01:41:03,313 --> 01:41:04,733
You want me to sign them?

1327
01:41:12,405 --> 01:41:13,525
But what about The Wonder?

1328
01:41:14,073 --> 01:41:16,753
It's just a ship.
There's always another.

1329
01:41:17,743 --> 01:41:20,213
But you are my mother, and I
only have one.

1330
01:41:21,488 --> 01:41:24,672
So, you've decided to be
a clerk?

1331
01:41:26,002 --> 01:41:27,823
I knew that you would.

1332
01:41:27,922 --> 01:41:29,845
Headstrong, or not.

1333
01:41:37,430 --> 01:41:39,060
You're not a nice man, Hamish.

1334
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:43,354
I'm glad my daughter didn't
marry you.

1335
01:41:46,599 --> 01:41:47,903
Mrs. Kingsleigh?

1336
01:41:48,002 --> 01:41:49,404
Mrs. Kingsleigh!
No, you can't!

1337
01:41:49,539 --> 01:41:50,859
You can't!
You can't!

1338
01:41:51,778 --> 01:41:54,198
Alice can do whatever Alice
chooses.

1339
01:41:56,490 --> 01:41:58,161
And so can I.

1340
01:41:59,953 --> 01:42:00,872
Good day.

1341
01:42:06,877 --> 01:42:08,377
Mother?

1342
01:42:25,311 --> 01:42:26,811
Higher.

1343
01:42:28,689 --> 01:42:30,189
Higher.

1344
01:42:32,109 --> 01:42:34,149
Perfect!
Thank you, gentlemen.

1345
01:42:36,489 --> 01:42:38,579
We'll run the Ascots out of
business, in a year.

1346
01:42:38,742 --> 01:42:39,832
Mother?

1347
01:42:45,164 --> 01:42:46,704
A full cargo aboard, captain.

1348
01:42:46,875 --> 01:42:49,454
Shall we commence with Kingsleigh
and Kingsleigh's maiden voyage?

1349
01:42:49,627 --> 01:42:52,627
Time and tide wait for no man,
Mr. Harcourt.

1350
01:42:52,797 --> 01:42:55,007
Or, indeed, woman.

1351
01:42:56,426 --> 01:42:57,546
Captain on board.

1352
01:42:57,719 --> 01:42:58,798
Full sail.

1353
01:52:43,639 --> 01:52:44,679
Time to go.
