1
00:00:53,301 --> 00:00:55,459
The war between sorcerers
was fought...

2
00:00:55,567 --> 00:00:57,222
in the shadows of history.

3
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:04,036
And the fate of mankind rested with
the just and powerful ... Merlin.

4
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,862
He taught his secrets to
three trusted apprenctices.

5
00:01:07,973 --> 00:01:13,362
Balthazar, Veronica and Horvath.

6
00:01:13,476 --> 00:01:16,738
He should have trusted only two...

7
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:28,532
Veronica and Balthazar witnessed the savagery
of a sorcerer beyond evil ...

8
00:01:32,983 --> 00:01:38,227
Morgana le Fay, Merlin's most deadly enemy.

9
00:01:53,858 --> 00:01:57,466
We are but servants.

10
00:01:58,293 --> 00:02:00,862
- Merlin.
- Horvath.

11
00:02:01,425 --> 00:02:04,721
You betray me?

12
00:02:06,144 --> 00:02:10,192
I am no one's servant.

13
00:02:10,303 --> 00:02:12,535
Well done.
Now get the spell.

14
00:02:12,643 --> 00:02:17,728
And so it was, Morgana gained the sorcerer's
most dangerous spell.

15
00:02:17,842 --> 00:02:20,467
Known as "The Rising".

16
00:02:20,576 --> 00:02:23,284
Giving Morgana the power to raise an army of the
dead ...

17
00:02:23,392 --> 00:02:26,366
and enslave mankind

18
00:02:40,571 --> 00:02:46,949
Veronica sacrificed herself for Balthazar, by pouring
Morgana's soul into her own body.

19
00:02:47,064 --> 00:02:51,506
But Morgana began to kill her
from the inside.

20
00:02:52,294 --> 00:02:55,727
To save Veronica's  life
and to capture Morgana

21
00:02:55,837 --> 00:02:59,597
Balthazar trapped  them both in
the Grim Hold ...

22
00:02:59,707 --> 00:03:03,510
An inescapable prison

23
00:03:03,621 --> 00:03:05,920
Over time, Balthazar fought ...

24
00:03:06,029 --> 00:03:08,439
many sorcerers who tried  to free
Morgana.

25
00:03:08,547 --> 00:03:12,848
Trapping them in layer upon layer of the doll

26
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,213
Eventually he captured Horvath as well.

27
00:03:17,761 --> 00:03:22,483
As Merlin lay dying, he gave
Balthazar his dragon ring saying  ...

28
00:03:22,596 --> 00:03:27,444
it would guide him to the child
who would one day grow to be Merlin's successor,

29
00:03:27,557 --> 00:03:29,402
the Prime Merlinian.

30
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:35,374
The Prime Merlinian is the only one who can kill
Morgana.

31
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:39,666
Balthazar would search for  centuries.

32
00:03:54,136 --> 00:03:58,484
And never it is said, will Balthazar
waiver from his quest.

33
00:03:58,595 --> 00:04:01,262
For mankind will never be safe,

34
00:04:01,371 --> 00:04:07,585
Until Morgana is destroyed
by the Prime Merlinian.

35
00:04:15,818 --> 00:04:18,809
Hey, Tank.
How did you get up here?

36
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:23,723
David? Field trip today.
Don't forget to wear clean underwear

37
00:04:23,836 --> 00:04:27,120
She means me, not you.

38
00:04:52,611 --> 00:04:55,713
You're not supposed to be doing that, Dave.

39
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,798
Look, now.

40
00:04:59,622 --> 00:05:04,218
David.
That is cool .

41
00:05:12,311 --> 00:05:15,448
THE SORCERER'S APPRENTICE

42
00:05:15,765 --> 00:05:22,489
<i>... Before Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty
were even built, there were  ..</i>

43
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:25,967
- Give it to Becky.
- Pass it on.

44
00:05:26,221 --> 00:05:29,988
- Give it to Becky.
- Here.

45
00:05:31,178 --> 00:05:35,130
<i>Check one: I would like to be David's
( )  friend     ( )  girl friend.</i>

46
00:06:01,581 --> 00:06:04,280
Hey, stop.

47
00:06:19,648 --> 00:06:22,201
Excuse me.

48
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,215
no...

49
00:06:24,322 --> 00:06:27,406
No way, don't.

50
00:06:48,099 --> 00:06:51,029
Arcana CabaÃ±a
Founded in 1888

51
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:35,591
No way ..

52
00:07:46,585 --> 00:07:51,583
The second emperor of the Han Dynasty,
locked his least favorite wife in this urn...

53
00:07:51,697 --> 00:07:55,199
for  ten years... to the day

54
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:59,860
They say  if you open it up,
the same thing will happen to you.

55
00:07:59,971 --> 00:08:02,062
I'm sorry.
I'm looking for this note.

56
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:05,862
Have you seen it?
It's kinda just blown to your store

57
00:08:05,972 --> 00:08:08,797
- A note?
- It was blown to your store.

58
00:08:08,907 --> 00:08:12,467
- It was just  a...
- Coincidence.

59
00:08:12,578 --> 00:08:15,828
Yeah, it was just a coincidence.

60
00:08:20,176 --> 00:08:22,340
I have something I'd like to show you, Dave.

61
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:26,690
- How'd you know my name was Dave?
- Coz I can read minds!.

62
00:08:28,198 --> 00:08:31,450
It's on your backpack.

63
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:36,223
Come over here.

64
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:54,545
This is very special, and if it likes you,
you can keep it

65
00:08:54,782 --> 00:08:59,612
I better not. My teacher said I can't be gone for long.
She knows I'm here.

66
00:08:59,726 --> 00:09:04,762
You're a bad liar, Dave.
That is good.

67
00:09:10,192 --> 00:09:12,938
Oh boy

68
00:09:38,802 --> 00:09:45,517
- No way
- I have been searching for  a very long time.

69
00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:50,327
Magically, here you are.

70
00:09:50,437 --> 00:09:54,142
That ring on your finger
means something, Dave.

71
00:09:54,253 --> 00:10:00,094
It means you're going to be
a very important sorcerer one day

72
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:05,878
And your first lesson begins right now,
with your very own Incantus.

73
00:10:05,993 --> 00:10:10,373
Do not move, do not touch anything.

74
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:13,019
No way

75
00:11:30,864 --> 00:11:34,518
- When am I?
- New York City.

76
00:11:34,628 --> 00:11:43,622
Not 'where'. The year.
You are wasting my time.

77
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:50,474
What happened to:
"Don't touch anything?"

78
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:54,345
- That's not very sporting of you, Balthazar.
- Be quiet.

79
00:11:54,456 --> 00:11:58,872
It's not you. He's been like this for a thousand years.
I'll explain later.

80
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:02,938
I need  the Grim Hold
Where is that doll?

81
00:12:44,044 --> 00:12:47,378
I'll have that doll

82
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:36,128
I want that doll.

83
00:13:41,908 --> 00:13:45,815
Leave, Dave!.
Leave now!.

84
00:13:54,746 --> 00:13:56,678
David Stutler. Never leave your...

85
00:13:56,786 --> 00:14:00,100
There are strange magicians there.
They are made of roaches.

86
00:14:00,211 --> 00:14:05,813
No. Don't go in there. The shop is on fire.
Do not go inside. These guys are...

87
00:14:08,867 --> 00:14:11,646
... Crazy.

88
00:14:13,974 --> 00:14:17,289
You really shouldn't tell stories. Let's go

89
00:14:19,412 --> 00:14:22,616
Eew. He peed in his pants.

90
00:14:24,061 --> 00:14:27,603
A jar broke.
It's just water. There was a fire.

91
00:14:27,715 --> 00:14:32,452
Stutler. He's an idiot.

92
00:14:54,989 --> 00:14:59,659
TEN YEARS LATER
TODAY

93
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:08,518
Good morn.... What is that... Oh, right.

94
00:15:08,752 --> 00:15:12,156
Good morning, beautiful.

95
00:15:14,573 --> 00:15:16,914
Hey, heads up.

96
00:15:17,022 --> 00:15:19,122
Happy birthday.

97
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:23,542
- Thank you, Bennet.
- You're up early.

98
00:15:23,655 --> 00:15:29,105
Mr. Hiedermann wants me to give a
presentation to his physics 101 class.

99
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:31,091
What? Teaching long division to English majors?

100
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,043
I know, it's like the Peace Corps,
but it's Hiedermann's class.

101
00:15:34,152 --> 00:15:37,387
Hey, Bio nerds are getting drunk tonight.

102
00:15:37,497 --> 00:15:42,541
... and we invited cheerleaders
from Princeton.

103
00:15:42,654 --> 00:15:46,222
Oh!. So thery're smart cheerleaders?

104
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:51,608
So. Seriuosly? You're saying you don't
wanna go out on your birthday?

105
00:15:52,496 --> 00:15:56,642
I got to finish my tesla coil project,
if I wanna graduate.

106
00:15:58,478 --> 00:16:02,179
Dave... are you familiar with the gray wolf?

107
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:05,251
No, please, Bennet. Not this again with
the gray wolf. I can't...

108
00:16:05,361 --> 00:16:07,936
The gray wolf is a pack animal.

109
00:16:08,045 --> 00:16:14,789
He must find a mate. He must
hunt and grunt. He must participate.

110
00:16:14,906 --> 00:16:17,630
You're gonna get voted out of the pack.

111
00:16:17,739 --> 00:16:20,755
Alone. Eaten by
a hungry bear.

112
00:16:20,864 --> 00:16:26,909
That's a real pick-me-up pep talk,
and I'm ready to go get the day.

113
00:16:30,775 --> 00:16:38,303
What? No, no, man...

114
00:16:41,398 --> 00:16:44,873
Is everything okay down there?

115
00:16:48,368 --> 00:16:53,881
- I should just leave, right?
- Right.

116
00:17:01,678 --> 00:17:07,106
Wait, I'm sorry.
Becky? Becky Barnes.

117
00:17:10,649 --> 00:17:16,289
Dave...
We were in fourth grade  together .

118
00:17:16,404 --> 00:17:21,058
- I do know you. Dave Stutler, right?
- That's me.

119
00:17:21,303 --> 00:17:25,509
You're that kid that the...
What is that place called? Arcana...

120
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:31,571
- Arcana Cabana?
- Yeah. So, did you transfer?

121
00:17:31,686 --> 00:17:36,018
Yeah. I did. And got some help. treatments.

122
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:39,151
Yes. That was weird.

123
00:17:39,261 --> 00:17:43,054
Yeah. You know what?
It turns out it's just a glucose imbalance

124
00:17:43,165 --> 00:17:46,962
Hallucinations?
Not uncommon in young subjects.

125
00:17:47,072 --> 00:17:53,041
- Ah, right.
- That's a great anecdote.

126
00:18:10,481 --> 00:18:13,107
Hey, Becky.

127
00:18:13,215 --> 00:18:15,697
Becky. Hey, hey, Becky?

128
00:18:15,806 --> 00:18:19,131
So how are you enjoying physics 101?

129
00:18:19,242 --> 00:18:24,462
- My .. my  brain does not thinks physics.
- So what does it think then?

130
00:18:24,575 --> 00:18:27,012
Music, mostly.

131
00:18:27,121 --> 00:18:29,228
So, this is me.

132
00:18:29,335 --> 00:18:33,920
- You work at a radio station?
- Yeah, I do an afternoon show.

133
00:18:34,034 --> 00:18:38,545
- Are you kidding me? That's so cool.
- It's just college radio.

134
00:18:38,656 --> 00:18:40,441
Like seven people listen to it.

135
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:45,086
Oh no, well, I'll be listening. That's one more.
You can round it up to eight.

136
00:18:47,595 --> 00:18:49,913
I think that's our antenna.

137
00:18:50,022 --> 00:18:53,380
- What's going on?
- Hey gorgeous, the whole mixer is toasted

138
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:57,038
and Freddy called in sick.

139
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:02,703
Sorry to bother you.
Where does your engineer keep his equipment?

140
00:19:02,816 --> 00:19:04,946
Who is this guy?

141
00:19:05,056 --> 00:19:12,844
So, the good news is you're still transmitting.
The bad news. your antenna loss- way too high

142
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:24,053
Alright. If I know what I'm doing,
We.. should .. be .. good!

143
00:19:27,795 --> 00:19:30,747
- Thank you.
- No, please. It's my pleasure.

144
00:19:30,857 --> 00:19:33,939
I could tell that ..this is all
this is pretty important for you.

145
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:40,151
My show is like the one thing that...
You know.

146
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:46,218
Physics. That's my thing.

147
00:19:56,503 --> 00:19:59,864
- I'll see you around.
- You didn't ask her out!

148
00:19:59,974 --> 00:20:01,864
You just fixed their antenna
and you left.

149
00:20:01,972 --> 00:20:06,320
That's not the point.
She will remember me

150
00:20:06,432 --> 00:20:09,693
She will remember me?
Who are you? Braveheart?

151
00:20:09,803 --> 00:20:13,196
Bennet, I blew my shot of
getting this girl ten years ago...

152
00:20:13,307 --> 00:20:18,878
I can't do it again. Now, get out of here
before you get electrocuted.

153
00:20:19,457 --> 00:20:21,624
... And it's a miracle we
made it on the air tonight

154
00:20:21,732 --> 00:20:24,479
This show may not matter,
but the music does.

155
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:30,599
This is Becky Barnes, WNYU Radio,
hoping there's music all around you.

156
00:21:02,744 --> 00:21:07,100
I don't understand why did you
have to buy this piece of junk?

157
00:21:07,212 --> 00:21:09,994
Junk? It's an antique.

158
00:21:10,104 --> 00:21:14,351
Antique? It's a piece of junk
from a plea market.

159
00:21:30,024 --> 00:21:33,451
Am I the first one out?

160
00:21:34,636 --> 00:21:39,688
That's a yes.
Our ten years are up, Balthazar.

161
00:21:40,047 --> 00:21:45,750
When I get the Grim Hold from young David,
I'll tell him you said hello.

162
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:49,566
Cheerio, Balthazar.

163
00:22:38,169 --> 00:22:43,657
Dave Stutler
Rm 184th Grade B-

164
00:22:43,772 --> 00:22:46,362
I thought B- was generous.

165
00:22:46,471 --> 00:22:49,191
I've recently been released from
a ten-year sentence..

166
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:52,272
During which the only reading material available to me...

167
00:22:52,382 --> 00:22:57,513
was your so called report on Napoleon Bonaparte,
from your school bag.

168
00:22:57,627 --> 00:23:00,533
Your analysis was obvious,
your prose was weak.

169
00:23:00,643 --> 00:23:03,085
- I was nine!.
- Irrelevant!

170
00:23:03,194 --> 00:23:06,986
Where's the Grim Hold?
That doll you took from the shop.

171
00:23:07,097 --> 00:23:12,581
The doll held something very powerful,
something very important ... to me.

172
00:23:12,694 --> 00:23:15,781
You had it last.
I want it back.

173
00:23:15,891 --> 00:23:20,601
- Listen, I threw it in the street.
- Where's the Grim Hold?

174
00:23:20,714 --> 00:23:24,472
It's been a long time ago.
I don't actually know where it is.

175
00:23:25,854 --> 00:23:30,214
I'll cut the truth out of you.

176
00:23:36,775 --> 00:23:39,542
Sweet ..

177
00:23:40,847 --> 00:23:43,735
Get him.

178
00:23:43,844 --> 00:23:48,021
Wolves? No, no, no.

179
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,123
PLEASE SWIPE AGAIN

180
00:24:02,157 --> 00:24:05,484
GO.
- Thank you.

181
00:24:21,765 --> 00:24:25,720
Oh man, oh man. What?

182
00:24:27,694 --> 00:24:30,693
Oh, no, no.

183
00:24:36,076 --> 00:24:38,316
Kill him.

184
00:24:38,425 --> 00:24:41,159
No.

185
00:24:43,769 --> 00:24:46,752
Puppies?

186
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:54,370
Oh my...

187
00:24:54,828 --> 00:24:58,646
- No way.
- Where's the doll, Dave?

188
00:24:58,757 --> 00:25:01,852
Him .. him ...
Him... him... him...

189
00:25:05,142 --> 00:25:08,674
Alright, get up here now!
Now! Hurry!

190
00:25:42,394 --> 00:25:46,237
This is not happening..  this is not happening.
I taste sour  in my mouth.

191
00:25:46,348 --> 00:25:50,130
Take it easy, Dave. Deep breaths.

192
00:25:53,584 --> 00:25:56,035
What?

193
00:25:56,143 --> 00:25:58,226
Now, that is not happening ..

194
00:25:58,278 --> 00:26:00,909
What's wrong?
What is it?

195
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:05,405
No, no, no, no, no.
You are not doing this to me again.

196
00:26:05,517 --> 00:26:09,306
Do you have any idea what my life
has been like for the last ten year?

197
00:26:09,416 --> 00:26:12,246
I've been stuck in an urn for the last ten years

198
00:26:12,357 --> 00:26:17,632
So have I...
A figurative urn of ridicule!

199
00:26:17,746 --> 00:26:20,844
Do you know that in certain parts
of the tri-state area ...

200
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:26,886
they still refer to having a nervous breakdown as pulling
a 'David Stutler'? Did you know that?!

201
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,384
Try to be a good listener, Dave.

202
00:26:29,492 --> 00:26:32,885
That doll is called the Grim Hold.
It is a prison...

203
00:26:32,995 --> 00:26:36,431
for the most dangerous Morganians
in history.

204
00:26:36,541 --> 00:26:39,883
Each one locked up in a layer of the doll

205
00:26:39,993 --> 00:26:46,012
Horvath wants to free his fellow Morganians,
and destroy the world.

206
00:26:46,128 --> 00:26:51,682
This must not happen.

207
00:26:51,797 --> 00:26:55,047
Yeah, for sure .

208
00:26:56,548 --> 00:27:01,536
The truth is, you have a
very special gift

209
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:06,713
- You need to see that
- I just wanna be normal.

210
00:27:06,826 --> 00:27:11,057
.. Normal life. I wanna forget about
that day at Arcana Cabana.

211
00:27:11,169 --> 00:27:17,025
I wanna forget about magic.
I wanna forget everything.

212
00:27:18,089 --> 00:27:21,553
- You should duck.
- What?

213
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:30,070
You wanna forget magic?
Then why'd you keep the ring?

214
00:27:30,604 --> 00:27:35,205
I.... I  was going to
sell that on Ebay.

215
00:27:35,318 --> 00:27:37,085
You're still a bad liar, Dave.

216
00:27:37,192 --> 00:27:41,025
I like that about you. It's a good sign.
You have the gift.

217
00:27:41,138 --> 00:27:43,475
No, I have a life.

218
00:27:43,582 --> 00:27:45,895
You're the last person
Horvath saw with the Grim Hold.

219
00:27:46,003 --> 00:27:47,398
That puts you on his list.

220
00:27:47,506 --> 00:27:50,881
So unless you want him to turn you
into a pig,...  who just loves physics,

221
00:27:50,991 --> 00:27:53,659
Then you better help me
find that doll before he does.

222
00:27:53,767 --> 00:27:58,005
Ah, God. This is crazy.
You see how crazy this is, right?

223
00:27:58,118 --> 00:28:05,558
Alright. Alright. You help me
get it back,  you're done.

224
00:28:05,676 --> 00:28:09,328
- Really?
- You can walk away.

225
00:28:12,459 --> 00:28:15,776
Can you please put my dresser back?

226
00:28:19,571 --> 00:28:26,154
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.. what are you doing?
Oh No. Please,  don't do that. What are you doing?

227
00:28:28,476 --> 00:28:30,787
What? Whoa, what is that?

228
00:28:30,895 --> 00:28:32,802
It's my Grim Hold tracking device.

229
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:36,628
Biometric pressure spell that displaces
the atmosphere above the doll.

230
00:28:36,738 --> 00:28:38,391
It looks like downtown.

231
00:28:38,498 --> 00:28:40,783
If we can track the Grim Hold,
so can Horvath

232
00:28:40,891 --> 00:28:42,479
So why don't we just take the eagle?

233
00:28:42,587 --> 00:28:46,238
Too hot profile for a trip downtown

234
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:49,344
- I'll have to call a tow.
- That won't be necessary.

235
00:28:49,452 --> 00:28:53,947
Yeah, but this car has been
impounded for like ten years.

236
00:28:54,785 --> 00:28:58,275
Yeah, this is low profile.

237
00:28:59,693 --> 00:29:03,046
She missed me.

238
00:29:05,635 --> 00:29:10,402
Let me give you the basics. Strickly Sorcery 101.
Put on the ring.

239
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:14,052
- Nothing's going to happen.
- Yeah?

240
00:29:14,179 --> 00:29:16,262
Oh, no.

241
00:29:17,864 --> 00:29:18,989
Kidding.

242
00:29:19,095 --> 00:29:21,787
Have you heard that people use only 10%
of their brains?

243
00:29:21,898 --> 00:29:23,650
Sorcerers can manipulate matter...

244
00:29:23,757 --> 00:29:27,097
because the're born with the capability
to use the entire power of their brains.

245
00:29:27,207 --> 00:29:30,692
Which also explains why molecular
physics comes so easily to you.

246
00:29:30,801 --> 00:29:33,542
So wait... Is sorcery
science or magic?

247
00:29:33,652 --> 00:29:34,957
Yes and yes.

248
00:29:35,063 --> 00:29:38,878
For now all you need is a
basic-combat-spell. Making Fire.

249
00:29:38,989 --> 00:29:41,978
- What causes molecules to heat up?
- They vibrate?

250
00:29:42,088 --> 00:29:46,321
Everything we see is in a constant state of
vibration. That's the illusion of solidity.

251
00:29:46,433 --> 00:29:49,974
But how do we take that which appears solid
and have it burst into flames?

252
00:29:50,085 --> 00:29:54,408
We will the vibrations to go faster
Step 1: Clear your mind ..

253
00:29:54,520 --> 00:30:00,469
Step 2: See the molecules.
Step 3: Make them shake.

254
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:03,546
- Got it ?
- No, I definitely don't got it.

255
00:30:03,655 --> 00:30:06,608
Trust the ring, Dave.
And keep it so.

256
00:30:06,718 --> 00:30:10,890
Civilians mustn't know magic exists.
That would be complicated.

257
00:30:11,001 --> 00:30:16,308
...  Says the guy in the 350-year old
rawhide trenchcoat .

258
00:30:21,992 --> 00:30:25,089
I threw it in the street.

259
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,787
It's been a long time ago.
I actually don't know where it is.

260
00:30:27,896 --> 00:30:30,705
I threw it in the street.

261
00:30:30,813 --> 00:30:34,020
- Don't go in there ..
- He peed in his pants.

262
00:30:34,131 --> 00:30:37,089
The shop is on fire. Do not go
inside. These guys are...

263
00:30:37,199 --> 00:30:40,568
It's just water.
There was a fire.

264
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:45,550
- I threw it in the street.
- But where?

265
00:30:55,906 --> 00:30:58,299
Get away, freak!
I need to pull in there.

266
00:30:58,408 --> 00:31:02,969
- Are you addressing me?
- Hey! Don't mess with me.

267
00:31:05,137 --> 00:31:08,040
Where was I?

268
00:31:08,149 --> 00:31:11,344
Chinatown.

269
00:31:28,707 --> 00:31:33,571
You stay there. I'll get the Grim Hold.
Keep an eye up for Horvath.

270
00:31:40,538 --> 00:31:42,621
Hi.

271
00:32:07,459 --> 00:32:11,301
Can I help you?
Do you have an appointment?

272
00:32:11,412 --> 00:32:16,452
I'm sorry to trouble you. I'm looking for a...
Well, it's rather strange .. A nesting doll.

273
00:32:16,566 --> 00:32:20,328
It's about this big. Angry looking
Chinese gentleman on the front.

274
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,256
-  A nesting doll?
- Yes.

275
00:32:22,363 --> 00:32:28,216
- It's possible. I collect so many objects
- Tao fa ho long. (Your hair is beautiful)

276
00:32:28,331 --> 00:32:33,560
Ah, you speak Mandarin.

277
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:41,057
That was Cantonese, Horvath.

278
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:43,057
The Grim Hold. Where is it?

279
00:32:43,166 --> 00:32:46,248
An old associate of mine speaks
impeccable Cantonese.

280
00:32:46,357 --> 00:32:48,604
He lived about 200 years ago.

281
00:32:48,713 --> 00:32:57,038
Do you know him? Sun-Lok. Of course you do.
You locked him inside the Grim Hold.

282
00:32:59,038 --> 00:33:02,347
Opened it.

283
00:33:09,045 --> 00:33:14,652
Are you alright?
What, Oh... What the ..?

284
00:33:15,838 --> 00:33:20,792
- Hey, I'm like one of them.
- Dave. You should run.

285
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:42,665
What is wrong? Why is it so heavy?
This thing is heavy.

286
00:33:44,644 --> 00:33:48,491
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

287
00:34:20,598 --> 00:34:23,932
Be still.

288
00:34:40,976 --> 00:34:43,878
Balthazar.

289
00:34:49,382 --> 00:34:52,213
Come on

290
00:34:53,346 --> 00:34:56,193
You skipped the first step.
Clear your mind!

291
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:59,676
Get the first step.

292
00:35:02,799 --> 00:35:06,724
Clear my mind?
Are you insane?

293
00:35:07,379 --> 00:35:10,531
A little bit.

294
00:35:21,049 --> 00:35:23,795
Oh, man.

295
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:36,510
This is it.
Clear your mind . Believe.

296
00:36:00,872 --> 00:36:05,556
Yeah. Oh, go team.
Magical stuff.

297
00:36:14,512 --> 00:36:18,686
Did you see that? Did you see what I did?
I did it.

298
00:36:19,753 --> 00:36:22,865
I stood on the balcony.

299
00:36:22,975 --> 00:36:27,771
-  It can't be.
- Thanks, man.

300
00:36:30,678 --> 00:36:33,526
Unbelievable.

301
00:36:35,589 --> 00:36:37,474
Hey, what do you got?
Did you see what happened here?

302
00:36:37,583 --> 00:36:39,207
You know what?

303
00:36:39,314 --> 00:36:44,315
One rocket hits this paper dragon in this Asian festival
and lit it up like a birthday cake

304
00:36:44,427 --> 00:36:48,102
We get some muffled call
saying it was a real dragon.

305
00:36:48,213 --> 00:36:52,609
Between you and me, cap'n, I think some of
these folks were hitting the sake pretty hard.

306
00:36:52,723 --> 00:36:56,215
Sake is Japanese. actually ..

307
00:36:59,464 --> 00:37:02,439
Carry on.

308
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:05,489
- Sake is Japanese?
- Well, it is

309
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:09,223
- I was in character
- Oh, right

310
00:37:13,714 --> 00:37:17,346
You may now return the ring to me.

311
00:37:17,717 --> 00:37:20,743
I'm a man of my word.
You helped me. We're done.

312
00:37:20,853 --> 00:37:23,883
Right.. right

313
00:37:27,728 --> 00:37:31,078
I'd like to wear it some more.

314
00:37:31,933 --> 00:37:37,082
We need a place to work.
Somewhere under Horvath's radar.

315
00:37:37,196 --> 00:37:40,558
I think I can help with that.

316
00:37:47,082 --> 00:37:51,038
This was originally a subway turnaround

317
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:57,126
They let me work down here because some
of my experiments can be a bit dangerous.

318
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:02,973
Oh, my professor has a hook up
so nobody knows we're down here.

319
00:38:03,556 --> 00:38:08,148
I didn't have the chance
to give you this before.

320
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:11,443
Your Incantus.

321
00:38:11,778 --> 00:38:13,967
I remember it being bigger.

322
00:38:14,075 --> 00:38:16,029
Pocket edition.

323
00:38:16,138 --> 00:38:24,562
The Incantus is our textbook. The art,
science and history of sorcery

324
00:38:24,681 --> 00:38:28,331
Including our recent history as well.

325
00:38:29,754 --> 00:38:32,316
Come on.

326
00:38:32,424 --> 00:38:36,318
See? There you are.

327
00:38:38,435 --> 00:38:41,263
Before we can put Horvath
back inside the Grim Hold

328
00:38:41,372 --> 00:38:44,710
We must first turn you into a sorcerer ..

329
00:38:44,821 --> 00:38:48,776
Which begins now.
Step back.

330
00:38:49,574 --> 00:38:51,349
- I  really was doing something...
- Eyes open.

331
00:38:51,456 --> 00:38:55,061
- Yes.
- Mouth closed.

332
00:39:27,471 --> 00:39:29,718
This is the Merlin Circle.

333
00:39:29,827 --> 00:39:35,207
It focuses your energy.
Helps you master new spells.

334
00:39:35,322 --> 00:39:38,738
It is where you will learn the art.

335
00:39:38,895 --> 00:39:43,353
Step inside,
you leave everything else behind.

336
00:39:43,744 --> 00:39:50,517
Once you enter,
there is no going back.

337
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,682
So I should probably pee first?

338
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:58,983
Better safe  than...

339
00:39:59,911 --> 00:40:03,056
I can hold it.

340
00:40:07,169 --> 00:40:13,639
I'm Balthazar Blake, sorcerer of the
777th degree,

341
00:40:13,756 --> 00:40:17,312
and you are my apprentice.

342
00:40:18,484 --> 00:40:20,403
Sweet

343
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:23,251
Your ring is not a piece of  jewellery.

344
00:40:23,361 --> 00:40:29,038
It projects the electrical energy of
your nervous system into the physical world.

345
00:40:29,151 --> 00:40:32,182
Without his ring, a sorcerer
is powerless .

346
00:40:32,293 --> 00:40:35,571
The only other thing a sorcerer
needs ...

347
00:40:35,681 --> 00:40:38,790
.. is a nice pair of pointy shoes.

348
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:41,415
Your rubber soles block the current

349
00:40:41,523 --> 00:40:43,459
Plus it helps look classy.

350
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:46,995
These are old men shoes.

351
00:40:49,142 --> 00:40:50,676
Excuse me?

352
00:40:50,783 --> 00:40:53,714
I love them.

353
00:40:53,825 --> 00:40:56,786
A lot

354
00:41:12,447 --> 00:41:17,899
I haven't seen that cane since...
I saw a picture of it when I was  a boy.

355
00:41:18,012 --> 00:41:21,142
- You've been locked up a long time.
- And now I'm out.

356
00:41:21,253 --> 00:41:26,129
- And I need soldiers.
- I got one kid

357
00:41:26,367 --> 00:41:30,195
- He ain't old school
- One will do

358
00:41:30,313 --> 00:41:36,027
Your ingenuity and your heart, will give you an
advantage over Morganians.

359
00:41:36,142 --> 00:41:39,840
They rely only on the power of
their magic.

360
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:44,580
But if you're up against the wall,
there's  only one weapon of choice

361
00:41:44,693 --> 00:41:47,954
The plasmaball.

362
00:41:54,644 --> 00:41:57,546
Yeah, nothing. There's nothing, nothing.

363
00:41:57,656 --> 00:42:01,972
I got it.
I got one.

364
00:42:02,433 --> 00:42:05,602
Underwhelming.

365
00:42:05,712 --> 00:42:08,044
God.

366
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:11,057
Again.

367
00:42:17,903 --> 00:42:21,693
... And invite my soul...
And again.

368
00:42:22,654 --> 00:42:26,296
See? That's what
pad is...

369
00:42:33,212 --> 00:42:37,674
So I'll have a bath from the jewels then I'm gonna
emerge, right? And everyone's gonna think I'm dead.

370
00:42:37,787 --> 00:42:41,348
I'll reach into the big top hat
and I'll pull myself out,

371
00:42:41,459 --> 00:42:43,170
but I'm a woman.

372
00:42:43,278 --> 00:42:47,610
A ball of fire, right. A baby sitting in a napkin
but I would like  a tiger.

373
00:42:47,721 --> 00:42:51,691
If I could get like a tiger jump a leopard .

374
00:42:51,802 --> 00:42:55,240
<i>But not at his mouth, that's been done, I'm sure.
somewhere..</i>

375
00:42:55,350 --> 00:43:02,770
Good. Just perfect, doll.
Yeah, yeah,  keep it straight up, sister.

376
00:43:02,887 --> 00:43:06,586
Oh, do tell me this is a joke.

377
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:08,461
Sorry, are you lost?

378
00:43:08,568 --> 00:43:13,727
So, you are what passes for
a Morganian these days?

379
00:43:14,484 --> 00:43:19,537
- Maxine Horvath. You are one smanky  man...
- Will you excuse us, ladies?

380
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:22,730
Yes, excuse us, ladies.

381
00:43:22,841 --> 00:43:26,349
- Bob, you too.
- Bob...

382
00:43:26,459 --> 00:43:27,574
Sorry.

383
00:43:27,681 --> 00:43:33,635
So they tell me you're some kind of
... entertainer.

384
00:43:33,751 --> 00:43:35,713
Five sold out shows at
the Garden plus...

385
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:39,025
back end
on a pay per view.

386
00:43:39,136 --> 00:43:42,340
Did you ever see Morgana
pull a rabbit out of a hat?

387
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:45,584
Look, my master disappeared when I was fifteen.
Vanished.

388
00:43:45,694 --> 00:43:47,777
Left me with nothing but an Incantus...

389
00:43:47,837 --> 00:43:50,524
and some prescription guide for vandalment issues.

390
00:43:50,633 --> 00:43:55,774
- So I improvised.
- Well, the time for improvisation is over.

391
00:43:56,882 --> 00:44:00,447
Balthazar Blake may have found
the Prime Merlinian.

392
00:44:00,557 --> 00:44:03,802
He wears the ring?

393
00:44:05,965 --> 00:44:09,733
The best way to
to defend against fire...

394
00:44:10,953 --> 00:44:14,153
a vacuum ball.

395
00:44:14,499 --> 00:44:17,535
Your turn.

396
00:44:20,181 --> 00:44:24,616
- I did it. I did it.
- Excellent. Excellent.

397
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:27,814
- Excellent
- I did that.

398
00:44:29,071 --> 00:44:30,878
What's wrong with your
tesla coil?

399
00:44:30,881 --> 00:44:32,964
It seems to be firing on its own.

400
00:44:37,046 --> 00:44:40,838
- Really .. really funny.
- This will be hilarious then.

401
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:43,797
Oh, my God.

402
00:44:47,378 --> 00:44:50,595
- Dude.
- I think it's fair enough.

403
00:44:50,705 --> 00:44:54,841
- I haven't eaten in ten years.
- Yeah, yeah, fair enough.

404
00:44:54,953 --> 00:44:58,376
May I ask what's so special about this bench ?

405
00:45:01,978 --> 00:45:03,665
- No, no. No.
- What?

406
00:45:03,772 --> 00:45:05,884
There's no time for that
and too much at stake.

407
00:45:05,992 --> 00:45:13,173
That girl, she's the one, man.
And you're my mentor, Balthazar.

408
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:17,628
Aren't you supposed to help me achieve
my personal goals?

409
00:45:17,742 --> 00:45:22,097
Ahh.. yes, yes. Except I'm not your mentor.
I'm your master.

410
00:45:22,208 --> 00:45:27,450
And your master says: If Horvath catches
you out in the street, you'll die.

411
00:45:27,564 --> 00:45:32,154
Is she worth that?
Think about it, Dave.

412
00:45:37,319 --> 00:45:39,937
Don't eat my sandwich.

413
00:45:40,045 --> 00:45:43,055
Becky. What a coincidence.

414
00:45:43,165 --> 00:45:45,856
- Oh. Hi, Dave.
- Going uptown, or...

415
00:45:45,964 --> 00:45:49,065
- Are you stalking me?
- Not in a threatening way.

416
00:45:49,176 --> 00:45:52,065
Why was I even concerned?

417
00:45:52,174 --> 00:45:54,265
So I listened to your show last night.

418
00:45:54,373 --> 00:45:56,493
- Oh, what do you think?
- I would say it was amazing.

419
00:45:56,601 --> 00:46:01,449
I've never actually heard of any of those bands
which I think is a good indicator that they're cool.

420
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:04,302
I'm glad someone was listening.

421
00:46:04,411 --> 00:46:08,878
This may come as a surprise to you
I don't get up too much.

422
00:46:09,801 --> 00:46:13,837
Give me that. Come on. Come on
Give me the bracelet.

423
00:46:16,491 --> 00:46:20,223
That was my grandmother's bracelet.

424
00:46:21,181 --> 00:46:24,407
No.
Dave, don't!

425
00:46:34,436 --> 00:46:37,511
Can you just give me that bracelet back, please?

426
00:46:37,621 --> 00:46:40,185
You better run back to your girlfriend.

427
00:46:40,293 --> 00:46:44,862
Believe me, I wish she was...
You thought she was my girlfriend?

428
00:46:44,975 --> 00:46:47,569
Really?
Is that the kind of idea you got?

429
00:46:47,678 --> 00:46:51,116
You talk too much.
Shut up.

430
00:46:53,095 --> 00:46:54,808
What are you doing?

431
00:46:54,915 --> 00:46:59,039
I have no idea what you're referring to .
I honestly...

432
00:47:01,197 --> 00:47:04,056
- Oh, you seeing it?
- Heads up

433
00:47:10,086 --> 00:47:12,548
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, here you go

434
00:47:12,657 --> 00:47:16,291
- Your grandmother's bracelet.
- How did you do that?

435
00:47:16,402 --> 00:47:22,531
- That guy was huge
- I've been doing a lot of cardio.. cardio boxing lately ..

436
00:47:22,645 --> 00:47:26,998
Let me introduce Thunder, Lightning.

437
00:47:29,001 --> 00:47:32,271
Something about you seems different.

438
00:47:32,392 --> 00:47:35,805
I am wearing new shoes.

439
00:47:36,422 --> 00:47:39,172
- Nice.
- Thank you, is that your train?

440
00:47:39,282 --> 00:47:42,545
Yes. Thank you.

441
00:47:42,656 --> 00:47:47,254
Alright, I just want to tell you that if you
want me to help you with your mid-terms

442
00:47:47,367 --> 00:47:51,186
- You come by my lab. I'll text you the address.
- Yes. That'll be great.

443
00:47:51,298 --> 00:47:53,246
- Yeah?
- Ah, tomorrow?

444
00:47:53,353 --> 00:47:55,872
It's a date

445
00:47:55,982 --> 00:48:00,084
No, no ..  it's not a date.
It's a date ... like an appointment,

446
00:48:00,196 --> 00:48:04,321
It's a date, no ..date like an appointment.

447
00:48:11,316 --> 00:48:18,652
Love ..  is a distraction.
Sorcery requires complete focus

448
00:48:18,890 --> 00:48:23,596
Let's go, Thunder and Lightning.
There's more to learn.

449
00:48:26,625 --> 00:48:28,756
This is perfect.

450
00:48:28,863 --> 00:48:31,382
The Rising will happen here.

451
00:48:31,493 --> 00:48:41,033
We will use these satellite dishes on the rooftops.
There and there and there.

452
00:48:41,279 --> 00:48:42,314
Get it done

453
00:48:42,421 --> 00:48:46,400
'My Best of' DVD
drops next month.

454
00:48:46,511 --> 00:48:49,896
There you go. Alright.
Move.

455
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:55,933
Sorry, but it's just nice for them
to see a genuine icon like me.

456
00:48:56,047 --> 00:48:59,058
Fortunately, they will be dead soon.

457
00:48:59,168 --> 00:49:02,018
But before that...
we need to find the boy.

458
00:49:02,128 --> 00:49:05,362
Well, how do we do that?

459
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:09,106
We'll wait until he's alone.

460
00:49:11,457 --> 00:49:16,256
Now focus on control
Set me down slow and steady.

461
00:49:19,879 --> 00:49:22,885
Dave? It's Becky.

462
00:49:22,995 --> 00:49:24,865
Probably back shortly.

463
00:49:24,973 --> 00:49:27,533
Could you please hide?
Hide now, please.

464
00:49:27,641 --> 00:49:30,673
Dave, get back here.
We have important work to do.

465
00:49:30,784 --> 00:49:34,521
- Knock, knock.
- Yeah, Becky...Just a...

466
00:49:35,612 --> 00:49:40,259
- We should go. The library, anyplace.
- Dave?

467
00:49:40,372 --> 00:49:43,560
- Is that company I hear?
- Yeah.

468
00:49:43,671 --> 00:49:48,046
Umm. Okay. Fine, Becky, this is my...

469
00:49:48,159 --> 00:49:52,027
- Uncle. Uncle Balthazar.
- Dave, I'm confused.

470
00:49:52,139 --> 00:49:54,339
I thought you and I were staying in together.

471
00:49:54,447 --> 00:49:57,702
- Aww. If this is a bad time, I could come back... - No, no ..
- Actually.

472
00:49:57,812 --> 00:50:03,066
- No. No. Uncle, you and I
have plans for later on.

473
00:50:03,179 --> 00:50:05,288
- Becky, let's just get out of here.
- You know what?

474
00:50:05,396 --> 00:50:10,125
It's alright, because I just remembered I have
to go into town to pick up your anti-itch gram

475
00:50:10,237 --> 00:50:14,663
So you two stay here.
Pleasure to meet you.

476
00:51:03,472 --> 00:51:07,011
OK, enough with the studying.
There is something I wanna show you

477
00:51:07,122 --> 00:51:09,902
- What are these things?
- Tesla coils

478
00:51:10,011 --> 00:51:14,176
I was using them to generate something
called plasma.

479
00:51:14,289 --> 00:51:20,306
The thing is, I got so fixated on
the technical aspects of it that...

480
00:51:20,421 --> 00:51:26,509
I almost didn't notice something
kind of a ... beautiful

481
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:31,193
I think you better
step into my cage.

482
00:51:31,303 --> 00:51:35,365
OK. It's definitely the first time
anyone has said that to me.

483
00:51:35,477 --> 00:51:38,160
I'm not surprised.

484
00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:41,071
Just hold on to this bar, please.

485
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:46,180
With both hands.
Yep, OK.

486
00:51:50,856 --> 00:51:56,543
OK. Hold on tight
and enjoy the show.

487
00:52:01,199 --> 00:52:06,641
Oh, my god.
How is this possible?

488
00:52:06,756 --> 00:52:09,450
Ahm, the coils are firing at such a high frequency

489
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:16,507
that the sparks literally create sound waves
as they fly through the air... which is .. nerdy!

490
00:52:31,448 --> 00:52:35,270
You were listening.
I played this song the other night.

491
00:52:35,381 --> 00:52:38,643
These coils are my life.

492
00:52:38,753 --> 00:52:41,272
Two years I'm down here working with them...

493
00:52:41,381 --> 00:52:44,505
and they're making their own music
and it was lost on me...

494
00:52:44,615 --> 00:52:48,588
I was never able
to appreciate it...

495
00:52:48,699 --> 00:52:54,642
until I met you and heard you talk
about music on your radio show...

496
00:52:55,247 --> 00:52:58,915
aww... I'm just happy

497
00:53:24,248 --> 00:53:25,647
Alright, this is me.

498
00:53:25,753 --> 00:53:29,960
So you want to read up later?
Eight o'clock. my lab?

499
00:53:30,072 --> 00:53:32,265
Yeah, that'll be great.

500
00:53:32,373 --> 00:53:35,688
- With me?
- With you, yes.

501
00:53:35,798 --> 00:53:37,993
- Just making sure...
- I got yoga.

502
00:53:38,102 --> 00:53:41,353
Yeah, I gotta go to the bathroom.

503
00:53:41,463 --> 00:53:47,407
<i>I got a date with a girl
because I'm awesome...</i>

504
00:53:48,416 --> 00:53:52,010
- So you're the one?
- Excuse me?

505
00:53:52,549 --> 00:53:56,811
Prime Merlinian, eh?
You don't look like much

506
00:53:57,042 --> 00:53:59,616
I don't actually know what you're talking about.

507
00:53:59,725 --> 00:54:03,105
Good. Makes this easy.

508
00:54:06,427 --> 00:54:09,451
Don't have anyone to hear
you with your girly cries, huh?

509
00:54:09,562 --> 00:54:12,794
I don't actually  know who you are.

510
00:54:12,904 --> 00:54:15,365
Really? You don't recognize me?

511
00:54:15,475 --> 00:54:17,863
Are you in Depeche Mode?

512
00:54:17,972 --> 00:54:20,788
What?  what ... Arrgh ..

513
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:24,447
What do you weigh like?
About twenty?

514
00:54:24,556 --> 00:54:29,225
What the...?
Is this high school over again?

515
00:54:29,981 --> 00:54:31,826
Alright, l tell you what.

516
00:54:31,934 --> 00:54:34,828
Hit me with your best shot.
Your most powerful spell.

517
00:54:34,936 --> 00:54:37,551
- OK.
- Get the ring at. Put it on

518
00:54:37,661 --> 00:54:40,511
Good boy.

519
00:54:43,392 --> 00:54:46,025
- No, I'm joking.
- Nothing has happened.

520
00:54:46,133 --> 00:54:48,102
- Have you cleared your mind?
- Yeah, pretty sure.

521
00:54:48,211 --> 00:54:52,073
It is the pressure. The ring is on.
Take the ring off.

522
00:54:52,184 --> 00:54:55,765
- That might help.
- Enough, you Idiot.

523
00:54:55,876 --> 00:54:59,070
Watch the door.

524
00:55:01,313 --> 00:55:03,784
You...

525
00:55:05,603 --> 00:55:08,430
Oh, no.

526
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:12,043
- Hello, Dave.
- Hi.

527
00:55:12,683 --> 00:55:15,773
So, Dave...

528
00:55:17,155 --> 00:55:21,971
I'm going to kill you. right here
In this dismal bathroom

529
00:55:22,084 --> 00:55:24,988
It's not very classy
but there you go.

530
00:55:25,097 --> 00:55:30,496
Before we get to that unpleasantness,
you're going to tell me where the Grim Hold is.

531
00:55:30,758 --> 00:55:33,125
Where is she?

532
00:55:33,233 --> 00:55:34,799
She?

533
00:55:34,906 --> 00:55:39,503
Oh, he hasn't tell you, has he?

534
00:55:39,628 --> 00:55:43,604
The truth about who is inside the doll.

535
00:55:43,714 --> 00:55:49,591
Oh, sweetheart,
You've put your faith on the wrong man.

536
00:55:50,590 --> 00:55:55,795
Tell me, have you ever been in love?

537
00:55:55,908 --> 00:55:57,991
- I...
- Yeah, you're in love right now!.

538
00:55:58,095 --> 00:56:02,477
I can see it in your eyes.
No, no, don't deny it.

539
00:56:02,992 --> 00:56:08,664
I wonder what would happen
if you lost her?

540
00:56:08,779 --> 00:56:11,783
- I...
- Shut up.

541
00:56:13,908 --> 00:56:17,903
You'd be no better than the rest of us.

542
00:56:24,213 --> 00:56:27,379
Where's the Grim Hold?

543
00:56:28,439 --> 00:56:32,695
- I don't know.
- Dave, you really are the most dreadful liar.

544
00:56:32,807 --> 00:56:35,224
That's what I keep telling him

545
00:56:35,333 --> 00:56:38,583
Want your guy back?

546
00:56:43,855 --> 00:56:48,643
It's been awhile since I've seen the
Hungarian miracle.

547
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:54,961
I guess I'm just old fashioned.

548
00:56:58,634 --> 00:57:01,636
Balthazar, watch out.

549
00:57:06,309 --> 00:57:09,433
What are you doing here, Dave?

550
00:57:09,543 --> 00:57:11,322
Horvath was trying  to kill me.

551
00:57:11,429 --> 00:57:13,633
His moral compass
doesn't exactly point north.

552
00:57:13,742 --> 00:57:16,148
Yeah, and what about yours? huh?

553
00:57:16,258 --> 00:57:19,562
You haven't been completely truthful with me.

554
00:57:19,671 --> 00:57:24,120
That guy called me the Prime Merlinian.
Balthazar, what is that?

555
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:31,078
Now, I'[m not doing anything else until you start
being truthful with me about what's going on.

556
00:57:32,485 --> 00:57:35,819
Who is in that Grim Hold?

557
00:57:36,316 --> 00:57:39,242
Morgana.

558
00:57:44,897 --> 00:57:50,053
Wake up that moron in stall number three for me,
would you ?

559
00:57:54,169 --> 00:57:57,040
For heaven's sake

560
00:57:57,371 --> 00:58:03,498
Morgana, she was making preparations for
the Rising,

561
00:58:03,614 --> 00:58:06,209
Something that will enable her to enslave mankind ..

562
00:58:06,318 --> 00:58:09,816
by resurrecting dead Morganian sorcerers.

563
00:58:09,927 --> 00:58:12,083
So after the witch girl,
there's another doll...

564
00:58:12,192 --> 00:58:14,777
that contains the greatest evil
the world has ever known?

565
00:58:14,887 --> 00:58:16,216
She's in the last doll.

566
00:58:16,323 --> 00:58:23,109
And what would it have to do
with this .. er .. Prime Merlinian?

567
00:58:23,226 --> 00:58:27,446
Merlin had three apprentices,
I was one of them.

568
00:58:28,154 --> 00:58:30,815
You are Merlin's apprentice?

569
00:58:30,923 --> 00:58:34,231
He cast a spell that keep us from aging
until we found the sorcerer...

570
00:58:34,341 --> 00:58:40,580
who would inherit his power...
and his dragon ring..

571
00:58:42,686 --> 00:58:50,088
Some part of you, no matter how small,
must share the same blood.

572
00:58:50,206 --> 00:58:52,338
As Merlin?

573
00:58:52,446 --> 00:58:56,953
Great men have always been called.
This is your calling.

574
00:58:57,824 --> 00:58:59,432
Merlin said:

575
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:06,909
"The only one who'll ever be able to
destroy Morgana once and for all is the Prime Merlinian. "

576
00:59:07,178 --> 00:59:11,320
So I'm supposed to save the world?

577
00:59:11,432 --> 00:59:15,741
I.. I just don't think I'm up for that.

578
00:59:15,853 --> 00:59:20,994
You think I've been teaching you magic tricks
for some little girl 's tea party ?

579
00:59:21,452 --> 00:59:25,801
When you ste0pped inside this circle,
I told you there was no going back.

580
00:59:25,913 --> 00:59:28,561
You took an oath.

581
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:32,273
I've searching a thousand years for you.

582
00:59:32,385 --> 00:59:35,041
Fighting Morganians  ..
protecting the Grim Hold.

583
00:59:35,149 --> 00:59:37,535
You're going to set me free

584
00:59:37,645 --> 00:59:43,355
You have to become the Prime Merlinian,
and I am not asking.

585
00:59:51,153 --> 00:59:54,880
I have a student who is failing my class.
I need his file .

586
00:59:54,990 --> 00:59:59,534
First, I'll need to see your faculty identification card

587
01:00:00,198 --> 01:00:06,321
You don't need to see my faculty identification card

588
01:00:08,567 --> 01:00:12,443
I don't need your faculty identification card

589
01:00:12,554 --> 01:00:16,147
These are not the Droids
you're looking for.

590
01:00:21,441 --> 01:00:26,464
Here it is.
He has an unauthorized lab space.

591
01:00:28,247 --> 01:00:35,897
OK, so how do I know
when I'm it... the Prime Merlinian?

592
01:00:36,016 --> 01:00:40,201
The Prime Merlinian will become so powerful within,

593
01:00:40,313 --> 01:00:43,081
He no longer needs his ring to cast magic.

594
01:00:43,190 --> 01:00:48,640
When you can do that,
you're ready to take on Morgana.

595
01:00:48,755 --> 01:00:52,963
Hey. What is he doing here anyway?

596
01:00:53,769 --> 01:00:57,049
This should be good

597
01:00:57,305 --> 01:01:00,118
Schematic for a fusion spell.

598
01:01:00,229 --> 01:01:03,657
The merging of two souls
into one physical body.

599
01:01:03,767 --> 01:01:08,753
I've only ever seen one sorcerer successfully
pull up human fusion.

600
01:01:08,867 --> 01:01:12,647
- And Tank is here for...
- Practice.

601
01:01:12,757 --> 01:01:16,327
Are you telling me you're trying to possess Tank?

602
01:01:21,145 --> 01:01:24,807
Yeah, I'm so sure it's the best idea either.

603
01:01:24,919 --> 01:01:27,466
No.

604
01:01:29,575 --> 01:01:38,044
No, man .. Becky is coming now and I'm standing in a puddle.
I need to stop and clean.

605
01:01:38,164 --> 01:01:40,747
We're not done training

606
01:01:40,857 --> 01:01:46,207
Balthazar, I've been waiting ten years
to see this girl again

607
01:01:46,321 --> 01:01:50,141
Do you have any idea what's that like?

608
01:01:50,853 --> 01:01:54,725
When I come back
you better be focused.

609
01:02:01,352 --> 01:02:04,596
This is really sticky.

610
01:02:05,701 --> 01:02:08,767
I'm doomed.

611
01:02:08,876 --> 01:02:11,293
This...

612
01:02:13,835 --> 01:02:16,911
Thank you.

613
01:03:48,543 --> 01:03:51,965
I command you to stop.

614
01:03:53,469 --> 01:03:55,417
Stop.

615
01:03:55,526 --> 01:03:58,732
Oh, man.

616
01:04:26,035 --> 01:04:28,118
Becky.

617
01:04:29,254 --> 01:04:31,611
- Hi
- You're on time.

618
01:04:31,719 --> 01:04:35,986
- You forgot, huh?
- No, I didn't forget.

619
01:04:36,099 --> 01:04:39,573
- Is everything okay?
- Me? How are you doing?

620
01:04:39,683 --> 01:04:44,126
- I am good.
- Would you please stop that?

621
01:04:44,238 --> 01:04:47,345
Would you...

622
01:04:48,430 --> 01:04:53,054
It is probably the best for you to leave.
My God, what am I saying ?

623
01:04:53,166 --> 01:04:55,768
OK, OK .. I'll go.

624
01:04:55,877 --> 01:04:59,437
Yes, I'm sorry.
I'm having issues

625
01:05:06,364 --> 01:05:09,531
My coils ..

626
01:05:21,384 --> 01:05:24,654
Disperse..

627
01:05:34,741 --> 01:05:37,813
You have abused the sacred art...

628
01:05:37,924 --> 01:05:41,886
and you have abused the Merlin Circle.
Magic isn't a game.

629
01:05:41,997 --> 01:05:43,823
No shortcuts.

630
01:05:43,930 --> 01:05:48,341
Pooling in that water, and getting electrocuted,
That's how a sorcerer loses his power.

631
01:05:48,453 --> 01:05:50,535
What rule is that?

632
01:05:50,550 --> 01:05:53,749
Fourteen? Twenty-seven?
I can't even remember.

633
01:05:53,858 --> 01:05:57,433
What different does it make if it's obvious that
I can't even control a few mops.

634
01:05:57,544 --> 01:05:59,493
The stronger the man,
the stronger the sorcerer

635
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:03,073
- Thank you, thank you for another useless motto.
- I have another one for you.

636
01:06:03,185 --> 01:06:05,913
You will not control your magic
if you will not control yourself.

637
01:06:06,022 --> 01:06:08,773
You need to stop your worrying
and start believing in yourself.

638
01:06:08,883 --> 01:06:12,016
- Is that what you do?
- What I do isn't the point

639
01:06:12,126 --> 01:06:19,472
I think it is. I'm convinced you exist purely
to make my life a living hell.

640
01:06:19,590 --> 01:06:23,364
You don't know anything about a living hell.

641
01:06:27,657 --> 01:06:32,101
- You're making progress.
- No, I'm not making progress

642
01:06:32,954 --> 01:06:35,860
No ring, right?

643
01:06:38,696 --> 01:06:40,600
No magic.
I can't move the chairs.

644
01:06:40,707 --> 01:06:43,846
I can't do it.

645
01:06:44,254 --> 01:06:49,182
It's not me, Balthazar.
I'm sorry

646
01:06:49,524 --> 01:06:55,159
I'm not. I'm not a hero.
I'm not the Prime Merlinian.

647
01:06:55,274 --> 01:07:02,414
I'm just a physics nerd who
looks really really stupid in these shoes.

648
01:08:12,536 --> 01:08:14,619
Dave?

649
01:08:14,723 --> 01:08:17,794
What are you doing here?

650
01:08:17,905 --> 01:08:21,814
I saw you at the coffee shop,
So I followed you.

651
01:08:21,925 --> 01:08:25,340
You looked more distracted than usual.

652
01:08:25,450 --> 01:08:27,029
That bad, huh?

653
01:08:27,136 --> 01:08:32,424
Did you really think that one bad date
was gonna make me hate you forever?

654
01:08:33,961 --> 01:08:36,345
Yeah

655
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:41,599
I do have to ask you this one thing.

656
01:08:42,972 --> 01:08:45,375
What are you doing up here?

657
01:08:45,484 --> 01:08:50,276
A friend of mine brought me here once.

658
01:08:50,388 --> 01:08:54,542
And the height doesn't bother you?

659
01:08:54,795 --> 01:08:57,356
- Are you afraid of heights?
- A little bit, yeah .

660
01:08:57,465 --> 01:08:59,725
Trust me. Here. Come on.

661
01:08:59,833 --> 01:09:01,983
Come on. You're good

662
01:09:02,090 --> 01:09:05,405
I don't know.

663
01:09:14,791 --> 01:09:18,104
Do you remember when you drew King Kong
in the bus window?

664
01:09:18,214 --> 01:09:22,025
And he lined up with
the Empire State Building?

665
01:09:22,136 --> 01:09:26,498
- You remember that?
- That was cool.

666
01:09:27,466 --> 01:09:31,460
You saw the world in your own way.

667
01:09:31,572 --> 01:09:34,823
I was just trying to impress you.

668
01:09:34,933 --> 01:09:40,259
Well, it worked.
Not bad for 10-year old kid.

669
01:09:40,372 --> 01:09:44,249
Right. What happened?

670
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:46,144
What? What do you mean?

671
01:09:46,251 --> 01:09:51,853
The bitter irony of the fact that 10-year old me
is far cooler than 20-year old me.

672
01:09:51,967 --> 01:09:55,438
I think 20-year old Dave is alright

673
01:09:55,549 --> 01:10:01,688
Like alright - alright, or ALRIGHT - alright?

674
01:10:03,130 --> 01:10:07,296
I think he is somewhere in the middle

675
01:10:07,407 --> 01:10:11,030
That's a diplomatic answer.

676
01:10:11,464 --> 01:10:14,297
And thank you.

677
01:10:24,414 --> 01:10:28,554
I'm sorry I think you and I
need to have a talk.

678
01:10:28,668 --> 01:10:32,191
No apology necessary.
But let's move on.

679
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:36,180
You're a darling, mate.

680
01:10:48,854 --> 01:10:53,305
Surprisingly well done.
Now go find the Grim Hold.

681
01:10:55,695 --> 01:10:59,220
You seem to have rather a soft spot
for that boy.

682
01:10:59,331 --> 01:11:02,645
Has Balthazar
made a new friend?

683
01:11:02,755 --> 01:11:06,784
- I don't see the Grim Hold.
- That's because you're using your eyes.

684
01:11:06,895 --> 01:11:12,024
Clever Balthazar.
Always up to his little tricks.

685
01:11:33,944 --> 01:11:36,779
Found it

686
01:11:38,505 --> 01:11:41,620
It's lighter than I remembered.

687
01:11:41,905 --> 01:11:45,906
- We once fought together, Maxim.
- A lot has happened since those days .

688
01:11:46,018 --> 01:11:49,914
- This isn't about that .
- Yes it is, Balthazar.

689
01:11:50,025 --> 01:11:54,922
It's always about that
Veronica chose you instead of me,

690
01:11:55,036 --> 01:11:58,757
The great Balthazar Blake,

691
01:11:59,001 --> 01:12:01,151
My best friend.

692
01:12:01,259 --> 01:12:05,801
Well, I'm going to let you watch me
release Morgana.

693
01:12:05,914 --> 01:12:10,631
Let you watch your world
crumble into nothing

694
01:12:31,261 --> 01:12:34,579
Drake. Let's go

695
01:12:35,608 --> 01:12:38,390
- Nice catch.
- Is that what you want?

696
01:12:38,499 --> 01:12:42,087
- They got the doll.
- We'll get it back.

697
01:12:44,831 --> 01:12:46,793
Hang on.

698
01:12:46,901 --> 01:12:49,945
Hang on, Tank.

699
01:13:03,526 --> 01:13:06,581
To the left.

700
01:13:11,572 --> 01:13:13,174
What the hell?

701
01:13:13,281 --> 01:13:14,575
He's in here somewhere

702
01:13:14,682 --> 01:13:17,509
Wait, he has the power to turn his car into
a taxi?

703
01:13:17,618 --> 01:13:21,257
Use your ring and lock in on the Grim Hold.
Remember, it moves with the ring.

704
01:13:21,369 --> 01:13:24,416
Okay, right .. right.

705
01:13:30,978 --> 01:13:33,632
Go. Go!

706
01:13:35,095 --> 01:13:38,324
There they come.

707
01:13:43,136 --> 01:13:45,224
What the heck?

708
01:13:45,332 --> 01:13:48,280
Nice one.

709
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:57,201
- Look at that.
- Hang on.

710
01:14:03,065 --> 01:14:06,704
- Oh my god.
- Take the tunnel.

711
01:14:19,081 --> 01:14:22,414
What is that? Smoke?

712
01:14:26,549 --> 01:14:30,102
Come on.

713
01:14:40,265 --> 01:14:43,933
Time for a little revenge.

714
01:14:49,483 --> 01:14:50,834
What the heck is this?

715
01:14:50,941 --> 01:14:54,033
Yes, we drove through  a mirror.
We're trapped in a reversed world.

716
01:14:54,142 --> 01:14:57,148
It is. Horvath's pay back.
For the bathroom mirror.

717
01:14:57,257 --> 01:14:59,674
Oh, no. no. We won't die
as long as we get out of here soon.

718
01:14:59,783 --> 01:15:01,597
By driving through our own reflection.

719
01:15:01,705 --> 01:15:03,910
Fantastic. There. In the window.

720
01:15:04,019 --> 01:15:07,176
This is it.

721
01:15:14,087 --> 01:15:16,171
Oh, no, no. You're not...

722
01:15:16,279 --> 01:15:18,986
- Here we go.
- We're not gonna make that.

723
01:15:41,587 --> 01:15:43,703
Hello, Balthazar.

724
01:15:43,813 --> 01:15:49,863
Oh, man. No, no. Back up. Back up!.

725
01:15:51,137 --> 01:15:53,294
Oh, man.

726
01:15:53,401 --> 01:15:55,007
I got an idea. I got an idea.

727
01:15:55,114 --> 01:15:58,566
- Dave, don't.
-  Please, I want to do it.

728
01:15:59,373 --> 01:16:02,338
- What?
- 73 Pinto? This is your idea?

729
01:16:02,449 --> 01:16:09,299
No. No.
My idea was to turn their car into a beater

730
01:16:13,919 --> 01:16:17,511
- Finish it.
- Right!.

731
01:16:24,373 --> 01:16:28,217
I think he stopped.

732
01:16:37,845 --> 01:16:42,211
Hang up, Tank.
I got you, buddy.

733
01:17:03,214 --> 01:17:08,183
I am sorry I thought you're
someone else.

734
01:17:09,987 --> 01:17:13,388
Where is Horvath?
Did he get away?

735
01:17:13,499 --> 01:17:17,607
Where's the Grim Hold?
Who was that?

736
01:17:18,588 --> 01:17:23,230
That was her, wasn't it?
The third apprentice

737
01:17:25,674 --> 01:17:28,400
For centuries Veronica, Horvath and I...

738
01:17:28,511 --> 01:17:33,002
were the only thing standing between Morgana and
man's destruction

739
01:17:33,113 --> 01:17:38,862
Our friendship and our magic
were what Veronica and I depended on ..

740
01:17:39,032 --> 01:17:42,450
You fell for her, didn't you?

741
01:17:42,656 --> 01:17:45,968
I fell for her.

742
01:17:46,974 --> 01:17:51,128
.. like you, all Veronica wanted was to be normal.

743
01:17:51,239 --> 01:17:55,703
Normal things, normal life.

744
01:17:56,356 --> 01:17:59,362
I saw them.

745
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:03,636
And so is Horvath ..

746
01:18:04,425 --> 01:18:06,798
That's why Horvath betrayed us.

747
01:18:06,906 --> 01:18:13,792
..  For a thousand years you've been carrying her
around with you. in the Grim Hold.

748
01:18:14,574 --> 01:18:18,482
I was going to give this to her that night.

749
01:18:25,998 --> 01:18:29,142
I am sorry

750
01:18:30,989 --> 01:18:38,134
Okay, Balthazar, we are going to get Veronica out
and destroy Morgana

751
01:18:38,944 --> 01:18:41,927
- What's happened to you?
- Nothing.

752
01:18:42,037 --> 01:18:45,009
- You're still a bad liar.
- Why does...

753
01:18:45,118 --> 01:18:47,505
You know, I'm glad she likes you.

754
01:18:47,613 --> 01:18:54,970
No, I am not surprised. Only glad.
There's nothing like it, is there?

755
01:18:56,251 --> 01:19:03,402
Put your old-man shoes back on.
We have some work to do.

756
01:19:06,732 --> 01:19:08,461
Are all the satellite dishes in position?

757
01:19:08,569 --> 01:19:12,664
All line up. I chip  my nail, which is not cool.

758
01:19:12,776 --> 01:19:15,379
No, I imagine it is not.

759
01:19:15,487 --> 01:19:18,764
Inside there, lies our next co-worker

760
01:19:18,875 --> 01:19:23,728
Abigail Williams, the little witch who put
Salem  on the map.

761
01:19:23,842 --> 01:19:26,478
Once she is out, we are at
the Morgana shell.

762
01:19:26,586 --> 01:19:30,164
that's going to take a lot of time and energy
to crack.

763
01:19:30,275 --> 01:19:34,701
- So, what are we gonna do?
- Have you heard of the parasite spell ? No..

764
01:19:34,814 --> 01:19:39,510
No. Sorry, I forgot.
Your education is somewhat lacking

765
01:19:39,624 --> 01:19:44,103
And I prefer to get more  by instincts.
Know it feels right.

766
01:19:44,215 --> 01:19:48,780
The parasite spell is a rather nasty piece of business

767
01:19:48,894 --> 01:19:52,525
It originated in Haiti, if memory serves

768
01:19:52,635 --> 01:19:58,073
It enables one sorcerer to steal
the energy from another

769
01:20:02,028 --> 01:20:06,497
But you weren't really using it, were you?

770
01:20:16,329 --> 01:20:19,329
Excuse me.
I'd  like to make a request

771
01:20:19,438 --> 01:20:24,347
I just finished my show but
maybe next time, okay?

772
01:20:31,828 --> 01:20:35,719
I said I'd like to make a request

773
01:20:41,696 --> 01:20:48,517
When Morgana is released, no matter what happens,
promise me yo'll do whatever it takes ...

774
01:20:48,634 --> 01:20:51,775
to destroy her.

775
01:20:51,886 --> 01:20:54,385
I promise.

776
01:20:54,493 --> 01:20:58,123
And for the record, you wear the old guy's shoes very well.

777
01:20:58,236 --> 01:21:04,803
My feet disagree with you. But thank you.
Knuckle bump!

778
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:09,086
Might as well ..

779
01:21:09,196 --> 01:21:13,717
Now that I've kidnapped the girl for you,
Is it time to release Morgana?

780
01:21:13,828 --> 01:21:16,920
I'll give her your regards.

781
01:21:17,030 --> 01:21:20,582
Mr. Horvath, have I done something wrong?

782
01:21:21,582 --> 01:21:24,808
Not at all.
I need your power to free Morgana

783
01:21:24,918 --> 01:21:28,571
I just don't need you.

784
01:21:29,900 --> 01:21:34,185
Oh, that's two.
One more to go.

785
01:21:44,815 --> 01:21:46,537
That's horrifying

786
01:21:46,644 --> 01:21:50,264
Let's just find the Grim Hold
and be done with it

787
01:22:03,253 --> 01:22:07,814
Battery Park,  the Rising.

788
01:22:14,579 --> 01:22:19,891
Persian carpet float.
And he thinks I'm old fashioned.

789
01:22:22,394 --> 01:22:25,778
Ostentatious.

790
01:22:44,807 --> 01:22:48,000
Nothing.

791
01:22:49,616 --> 01:22:53,057
So that's Morgana.

792
01:22:55,219 --> 01:22:58,051
Veronica.

793
01:23:08,707 --> 01:23:10,439
Balthazar?

794
01:23:10,546 --> 01:23:13,693
That was easy.
Come on, Dave. You know the drill

795
01:23:13,804 --> 01:23:17,126
- Give me what I want and I let her go.
- Dave, what's going on?

796
01:23:17,235 --> 01:23:20,863
- It is gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay.
- No, she is not.

797
01:23:20,974 --> 01:23:23,987
She's gonna be ground up into chunks
and fed to the cat ...

798
01:23:24,096 --> 01:23:27,208
unless you give me Merlin's ring
and the Grim Hold.

799
01:23:27,318 --> 01:23:32,998
And Balthazar? He is busy admiring the decor.
So what's it going to be?

800
01:24:01,621 --> 01:24:04,232
Here.

801
01:24:04,824 --> 01:24:07,896
Take it.

802
01:24:11,735 --> 01:24:16,673
Merlin's ring. It's been a while
since I've been this close to it.

803
01:24:16,977 --> 01:24:20,476
I wonder if it still works.

804
01:24:24,754 --> 01:24:28,605
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I guess.

805
01:24:34,051 --> 01:24:37,338
The Grim Hold?

806
01:24:38,807 --> 01:24:40,889
I see.

807
01:24:40,962 --> 01:24:46,909
He took my ring.
He was gonna kill Becky

808
01:24:47,025 --> 01:24:49,913
I'm so sorry, Balthazar.

809
01:24:50,022 --> 01:24:53,570
I would have done the same thing, Dave.

810
01:24:56,219 --> 01:24:57,771
Where are you going?

811
01:24:57,877 --> 01:25:00,459
Battery Park.
Horvath is going to release Morgana.

812
01:25:00,569 --> 01:25:04,012
You can't take him on and Morgana
at the same time.

813
01:25:04,122 --> 01:25:07,441
- That's... You literally can't.
- I have to try.

814
01:25:07,551 --> 01:25:09,468
Well then I'm going with you.

815
01:25:09,576 --> 01:25:15,586
Without any magic? He has your ring.
I am going alone.

816
01:25:15,701 --> 01:25:20,336
No. That's normal thing for him

817
01:25:22,214 --> 01:25:25,730
No one knows how much time they have...

818
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:31,667
.. to be with the people who are the most important.
Enjoy it.

819
01:25:44,540 --> 01:25:48,886
That guy just flew away on an eagle.
A steel eagle.

820
01:25:48,998 --> 01:25:54,044
Becky, I wanted to talk to you about this.
I just don't know where to start.

821
01:25:54,158 --> 01:25:56,720
I'm just happy you're okay.

822
01:25:56,831 --> 01:25:59,426
Look, Dave...

823
01:25:59,534 --> 01:26:06,672
if you just can tell the truth, then I promise
I would do my best to understand.

824
01:26:06,836 --> 01:26:12,569
Okay. The first thing you should know about me
is that I am a sorcerer.

825
01:26:14,132 --> 01:26:15,373
Okay

826
01:26:15,480 --> 01:26:20,090
I can conjure and duke plasma balls
out of my hands.

827
01:26:20,202 --> 01:26:24,216
I can speed up time, slow it down,
various degrees of levitation.

828
01:26:24,329 --> 01:26:28,272
And it was all very magical.

829
01:26:28,795 --> 01:26:34,333
And I thought my last boyfriend
was different, because he wore a scarf.

830
01:26:37,891 --> 01:26:42,661
- I'll come back, okay?
- Okay

831
01:26:42,775 --> 01:26:46,714
- I'll be back.
- Well I am here.

832
01:26:49,985 --> 01:26:52,698
- Bad time, Dave.
- Bennet, thank God you answered.

833
01:26:52,807 --> 01:26:57,606
I got a real emergency on my hand.
I need you to meet me at my lab. Right now.

834
01:26:58,886 --> 01:27:02,963
- Becky, I got to let you out.
- Let me out?

835
01:27:03,332 --> 01:27:05,768
- Okay
- I think I know how to defeat them ...

836
01:27:05,876 --> 01:27:08,663
- ..  without any magic.
- How?

837
01:27:08,773 --> 01:27:12,248
The rings on Horvath's cane.
He put them there in order to gain more power,

838
01:27:12,359 --> 01:27:14,874
but they make him
a better conductor

839
01:27:14,983 --> 01:27:18,355
Dave, I have no idea
what you are talking about

840
01:27:18,465 --> 01:27:21,181
Alright, Rebecca. Here it is.

841
01:27:21,507 --> 01:27:25,911
Many evil sorcerers will be raised
from the dead tonight.

842
01:27:26,022 --> 01:27:30,821
So basically, Morgana is going to destroy
the world as we know it.

843
01:27:31,023 --> 01:27:33,163
Oh, just that?

844
01:27:33,271 --> 01:27:37,050
This is really dangerous.
I can't bring you into it

845
01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:39,871
Well, I think I'm already into it

846
01:27:39,981 --> 01:27:43,739
And besides as you brought it,
we're all gonna die anyway, right?

847
01:27:44,053 --> 01:27:47,089
I want to come with you.

848
01:27:48,071 --> 01:27:50,794
You're sexy.

849
01:27:51,532 --> 01:27:55,029
- I got all the Tesla coil remote.
- Thanks, brother. I appreciate it.

850
01:27:55,140 --> 01:27:58,585
I found this after we hang up

851
01:27:59,097 --> 01:28:01,731
It was on the desk.

852
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:04,973
Give it to Veronica. Balthazar.

853
01:28:11,017 --> 01:28:15,822
I don't think Balthazar is
planning on coming back.

854
01:28:16,020 --> 01:28:24,054
I don't know what you're into here, Dave
but whatever it is you are getting me participating.

855
01:28:24,817 --> 01:28:28,581
Thank you, Bennet. I appreciate it.
We should  go.

856
01:28:40,612 --> 01:28:43,751
Now is the Rising.

857
01:28:44,953 --> 01:28:48,141
Now is the time

858
01:29:15,220 --> 01:29:17,879
Veronica.

859
01:29:19,295 --> 01:29:25,945
It's me, Horvath. Morgana.
No need to look so pathetic.

860
01:29:27,475 --> 01:29:32,159
Destroy that thing.
I never want to see it again.

861
01:29:33,071 --> 01:29:37,542
I can not raise the dead
until  the circle is complete.

862
01:29:40,858 --> 01:29:57,777
Spirit, I wear you on to terror
bring your terrible forces.

863
01:30:02,478 --> 01:30:03,868
No way

864
01:30:03,976 --> 01:30:05,880
- Man alive!.
- What?

865
01:30:05,988 --> 01:30:09,588
- Are you telling you  honestly don't see that?
- No. See what ?

866
01:30:09,699 --> 01:30:12,415
I think they're using the satellite dishes
on the tops of the buildings...

867
01:30:12,523 --> 01:30:15,266
to direct and amplify  the electromagnetic energy

868
01:30:15,375 --> 01:30:18,851
Alright, we're pulling over.

869
01:30:21,406 --> 01:30:23,862
Becky, I need you to do me a favor.

870
01:30:23,972 --> 01:30:28,028
I need you to go up to the very top of that thing.

871
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:31,003
- Great.
- You gotta move the antenna...

872
01:30:31,047 --> 01:30:36,028
- .. and just disrupt the signal.
- OK. Right.

873
01:30:36,399 --> 01:30:40,687
Becky. Remember that letter I wrote
when we're ten years old?

874
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:45,688
Friend or girlfriend?
I never saw what you checked, so...

875
01:30:45,801 --> 01:30:49,025
in case I die tonight, could you please tell me

876
01:30:49,535 --> 01:30:52,361
Don't die and I'll tell you.

877
01:30:52,469 --> 01:30:55,476
Oh. Yeah, okay.

878
01:31:28,531 --> 01:31:30,935
Balthazar.

879
01:31:33,513 --> 01:31:37,882
- Enough of your old tricks, Balthazar.
- As you wish.

880
01:31:46,301 --> 01:31:50,971
There was a time when things are pretty even
between us, Balthazar.

881
01:31:51,082 --> 01:31:57,030
As you can see, I've acquired
some new jewelry.

882
01:32:00,422 --> 01:32:03,040
I'm coming, buddy.  I'm coming.

883
01:32:03,151 --> 01:32:07,347
Alright. What? What is this?
What am I looking at? No.

884
01:32:07,459 --> 01:32:13,124
Come... And a walker.
Of course she has...

885
01:32:20,488 --> 01:32:26,553
A matador gored by a bull
can take up to three days to die

886
01:32:26,668 --> 01:32:30,081
Sounds unpleasant, doesn't it?

887
01:33:15,586 --> 01:33:20,329
The circle is nearly complete.
It must be awful, Balthazar.

888
01:33:20,443 --> 01:33:27,290
All these years fighting to stop this one moment.
And then coming up short.

889
01:34:05,498 --> 01:34:08,667
That's my car.

890
01:34:24,870 --> 01:34:27,811
Thank you.

891
01:34:36,610 --> 01:34:39,671
We're too late.

892
01:34:56,573 --> 01:34:59,433
Veronica.

893
01:35:01,861 --> 01:35:04,825
Is she...

894
01:35:05,601 --> 01:35:08,828
They're both still with us.

895
01:35:35,832 --> 01:35:39,078
Balthazar. What have you done?

896
01:35:39,188 --> 01:35:42,882
What you did for me.

897
01:35:44,765 --> 01:35:46,537
Remember your promise.
Balthazar, no.

898
01:35:46,645 --> 01:35:48,943
You will do whatever
it takes to destroy Morgana .

899
01:35:49,051 --> 01:35:52,835
No, I can't.
I will not lock you in this thing.

900
01:35:52,946 --> 01:35:55,466
And neither will I.

901
01:35:55,575 --> 01:35:58,911
How sweet.

902
01:36:09,392 --> 01:36:12,208
Oh, man.

903
01:36:13,451 --> 01:36:15,653
And now we end this.

904
01:36:15,761 --> 01:36:18,092
No.

905
01:36:21,971 --> 01:36:25,168
No way.

906
01:36:29,494 --> 01:36:30,782
No ring.

907
01:36:30,889 --> 01:36:34,756
- It is you.
- The Prime Merlinian.

908
01:36:40,198 --> 01:36:43,097
Veronica.

909
01:36:50,838 --> 01:36:54,422
Now it's my turn.

910
01:37:00,943 --> 01:37:04,391
Is that the best that you can do?

911
01:37:04,502 --> 01:37:07,724
I sure hope not.

912
01:37:24,108 --> 01:37:28,630
And now it's my turn.

913
01:38:03,690 --> 01:38:09,158
You have Merlin's powers, but you don't have
his strength or skill.

914
01:38:09,272 --> 01:38:11,697
You are still weak.

915
01:38:11,805 --> 01:38:15,955
But I'm not alone.
I brought a little science with me

916
01:38:16,067 --> 01:38:18,657
Now.

917
01:39:00,852 --> 01:39:05,897
I did it.
Balthazar, I actually didi it

918
01:39:15,351 --> 01:39:18,668
He's gone.

919
01:39:20,975 --> 01:39:24,508
He completed his quest.

920
01:39:25,606 --> 01:39:33,373
No, no.. no.  It's not over.
He can't die. Not now.

921
01:39:35,749 --> 01:39:38,875
Come on.

922
01:39:55,254 --> 01:39:58,686
That's not good enough.

923
01:39:59,966 --> 01:40:03,075
Veronica, would you please step back.

924
01:40:03,186 --> 01:40:08,244
If Morgana can stop his heart
maybe I can start it.

925
01:40:12,650 --> 01:40:15,616
Alright, here we go, buddy.
Here we go. Listen.

926
01:40:15,727 --> 01:40:21,454
You with all your stupid rules
and old-man shoes.

927
01:40:21,568 --> 01:40:25,618
Always saving me with that look in your eyes.

928
01:40:26,737 --> 01:40:31,396
Come on.

929
01:40:31,509 --> 01:40:34,056
Come on.

930
01:40:46,518 --> 01:40:50,018
I had a dream.

931
01:40:50,758 --> 01:40:55,555
You were insulting me, Dave.
Repeatedly.

932
01:40:55,668 --> 01:40:59,011
Me? Pretty weird, huh?

933
01:40:59,122 --> 01:41:02,087
No, it kind of make sense.

934
01:41:02,197 --> 01:41:04,520
Yeah.

935
01:41:08,115 --> 01:41:11,660
- Thank you.
- Welcome back, old man.

936
01:41:36,119 --> 01:41:38,811
Dave.

937
01:41:42,266 --> 01:41:45,961
You did it.
I know. I'm still alive.

938
01:41:46,073 --> 01:41:49,273
- Surprisingly, so am I
- I know.

939
01:41:49,383 --> 01:41:51,886
Oh, the note,  right.
Friend or girlfriend?

940
01:41:51,995 --> 01:41:55,049
I don't care

941
01:41:58,638 --> 01:42:02,318
Girlfriend
Definitely girlfriend

942
01:42:06,078 --> 01:42:13,238
Do you like to have breakfast with me? France...
-France?

943
01:42:15,443 --> 01:42:17,526
I got a ride

944
01:42:17,628 --> 01:42:20,907
Okay, you're funny.

945
01:42:25,195 --> 01:42:28,508
Something I forgot to mention to you...

946
01:42:28,618 --> 01:42:33,027
I really have no idea
how to land this thing.
