1
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:51,850
Am I ready?

2
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:57,156
You belong here.

3
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:33,085
Morning, Mrs. Kimbale.
Morning!

4
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:42,461
Brian, still sleeping.

5
00:02:42,463 --> 00:02:43,362
Phiona.

6
00:02:43,364 --> 00:02:47,366
Richard!
My little brother, get up!

7
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:54,882
Go away

8
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:56,007
You go away

9
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:24,002
It's only one.
It's 500 each.

10
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:25,637
All five?

11
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,041
- All five?
- Yeah.

12
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:30,142
2,500.

13
00:03:30,144 --> 00:03:31,777
Hey, when you want bargain?

14
00:03:31,779 --> 00:03:33,512
Sir, pay me 1,000.

15
00:03:35,516 --> 00:03:38,250
Two bags! Two bags!
Two bags, please.

16
00:03:38,252 --> 00:03:40,219
Your mother
still owes me some money.

17
00:03:40,221 --> 00:03:42,187
We'll make it up tomorrow.

18
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,559
That's it.
Now, tell your mother

19
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,361
I need my money.

20
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:08,547
Oh, my god, Phiona.

21
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:11,450
He rode me on his boda.

22
00:04:11,452 --> 00:04:13,952
Latest model, Chinese roadster.

23
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:15,053
China! Yeah!

24
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:16,755
Ask your sister why this man

25
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:18,190
takes young girls
on his boda boda.

26
00:04:18,192 --> 00:04:22,127
Mother asks, "why does he take
young girls on his boda?"

27
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:24,563
Theo has a big heart!

28
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:25,130
Brian.

29
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:28,634
I think she should keep this
boy at a proper distance.

30
00:04:28,636 --> 00:04:30,602
You must get 1,000, Phiona.

31
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:33,505
No, mama, it's too much.
I'm tired!

32
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:33,872
So am I.

33
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:36,775
Patricia's mother does not
force her to sell. I'm tired.

34
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:40,279
Patricia's mother has
a husband who is alive.

35
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:43,615
Did your father leave me
any money when he died?

36
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,285
Theo!

37
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,370
Night, let's go

38
00:04:49,056 --> 00:04:50,689
Night, where you going?

39
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:52,090
To get a ride.

40
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,560
Ah...

41
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:57,929
Are you the mother
or the sister?

42
00:04:57,931 --> 00:05:00,098
For you I'm not either.

43
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:03,869
And I know a hyena
when I see it.

44
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,375
You keep away from my daughter.

45
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:11,043
Stop it, mummy!

46
00:05:11,045 --> 00:05:14,479
If I see you sniffing
around here again...

47
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,848
I will burn this
pile of tin to scrap!

48
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:17,349
You be careful.

49
00:05:17,351 --> 00:05:20,519
This bike is worth more
than everything you have.

50
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:24,823
Theo.

51
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:26,124
Me, I'm gone.

52
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:27,492
Theo!

53
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:30,062
I will never forgive you
for this.

54
00:05:30,064 --> 00:05:31,496
I don't need your forgiveness!

55
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:35,834
I need you to sell maize
to feed your brothers!

56
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:37,636
Go.

57
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:39,104
Go!

58
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:44,843
Shirts. Shirts.
Shirts is outside.

59
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:48,447
Shirts is out.

60
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:51,483
Come here.
Shirts is outside you.

61
00:05:51,485 --> 00:05:52,951
Spread out! Spread out!

62
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:57,022
Joseph! Long passes!
Keep playing, keep playing.

63
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:00,158
Katende.

64
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,362
They turned you down.

65
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,197
I warned you.

66
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,499
They don't care
about your marks.

67
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:09,801
Only your family status.

68
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,838
I surrender, my friend.

69
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,007
I will accept the position
at your ministry...

70
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:17,809
But only until I'm able to find

71
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:18,477
an engineering job.

72
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,381
What makes you think
I still have a job for you?

73
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:30,322
So, you would be willing
to restore hope...

74
00:06:30,324 --> 00:06:34,493
And transform the lives
of children through sports.

75
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,495
Full time.

76
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:37,229
I would.

77
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:40,031
<i>Welcome.
Katwe needs you.</i>

78
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:53,845
One<i> maca?</i>
Just 300.

79
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:04,589
I said, no, thank you. Gosh!

80
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,759
Thank you. Keep dancing.
Keep dancing.

81
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,261
Thank you, madam.

82
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,100
Take my bucket, Phiona.

83
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:16,701
Where do you go every day?

84
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:17,335
Ah!

85
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:22,073
Brian! We haven't made
1,000 shillings yet!

86
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,980
Mmm-hmm.

87
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:30,782
Let's go!

88
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,119
Go! Go! Go! Go!

89
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:37,856
Why aren't you taking part?

90
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:41,426
You can break bones
playing football.

91
00:07:41,428 --> 00:07:43,261
My mother refuses.

92
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:45,030
No money for doctors.

93
00:07:45,032 --> 00:07:48,767
Me, I have broken a few bones
playing football myself.

94
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:51,169
Joseph, what did I just say?

95
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:54,072
There's another game
you can play.

96
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,541
Have you heard of chess?

97
00:07:56,543 --> 00:07:57,175
Me, I know.

98
00:07:57,177 --> 00:08:00,111
You kiss a person
and try to catch them.

99
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:04,883
No. It is a board game.

100
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:06,418
I can teach you.

101
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,119
I don't want.

102
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,255
Too bad, eh?

103
00:08:10,257 --> 00:08:13,191
I thought you might like
beating city boys.

104
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:14,659
What do you mean?

105
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,995
When I was at school...

106
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:19,464
<i>the city boys
with their gold watches,</i>

107
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:20,298
<i>they loved this game.</i>

108
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,201
<i>They had contests
to see who was the best.</i>

109
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:25,103
I'm ready when you're ready.

110
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,673
Me, I was an orphan.

111
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:31,843
<i>So, like you,
I had no gold watch...</i>

112
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:34,980
<i>But I practiced my chess.</i>

113
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,820
And I defeated them all.

114
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,161
Thank you.
I have tuition to pay.

115
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:56,668
Bring us this game.

116
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:58,336
You want to play chess?

117
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,873
Good.

118
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:24,829
Morning.
Morning, Brian.

119
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:26,131
- Morning.
- Morning, Brian.

120
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:27,365
Morning.
Morning, guys!

121
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:28,833
Hi, Gloria.
Morning.

122
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:30,835
- Joseph, hi.
- Morning, Ivan.

123
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:33,071
Hey, here comes coach.

124
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,407
Good morning, pioneers!

125
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:37,709
Good morning, coach!

126
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:18,283
Where are the cups?

127
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:33,965
Come for porridge!

128
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,140
Young girl.

129
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:44,242
Come.

130
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,911
Come inside. Come.

131
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,784
Are you hungry?

132
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:56,955
Ugh!

133
00:10:56,957 --> 00:10:57,789
You smell!

134
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,324
Who is that girl?

135
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:02,093
Have you been running
in mud like a pig?

136
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:03,428
Go away, smelly girl.

137
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:05,430
This is not your game.

138
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:15,840
Let go!

139
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:18,810
Let go! Let go!

140
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:22,947
Next time
I will tear that fat nose

141
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:24,082
right off your head!

142
00:11:24,084 --> 00:11:26,851
Who else is brave?

143
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,188
Me, I'm not brave.

144
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:33,191
Hey! A fighter.

145
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,860
What is your name?
Phiona.

146
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:36,828
Welcome.

147
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:39,364
This is a place for fighters.

148
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:07,225
Phiona.

149
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,576
I will take these rotten ones
from yesterday...

150
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:27,145
But you should be
giving them to me for free.

151
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:28,713
I'll give you something for free

152
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:30,782
when you give me
something for free.

153
00:12:30,784 --> 00:12:32,050
Here.

154
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:33,618
No charge.

155
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:49,934
Abdul, go and play ruwenda.

156
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:52,670
Gloria, would you
please show Phiona

157
00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:54,539
how to move the pieces.

158
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:55,907
Mmm...

159
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:58,843
We must be merciful
to the wicked.

160
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:00,078
Hmm?

161
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,918
This is little man.

162
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,119
His boda is broken,

163
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:10,288
so he can only bump into things.

164
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:13,424
Beep, beep, beep.

165
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:15,493
This is the queen.

166
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:18,897
She is the most powerful
of all the pieces.

167
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:20,932
What do they all do?

168
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:22,734
They kill each other.

169
00:13:22,736 --> 00:13:25,069
See, dead.

170
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,640
This is the president.

171
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:34,279
If your president is trapped,
nowhere to go...

172
00:13:34,281 --> 00:13:36,648
You say, checkmate.

173
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:37,315
Checkmate.

174
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:41,119
Now, go away.
I don't like your bad smell.

175
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:07,312
Hey, Phiona!
How is your life?

176
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:08,813
It is fine.

177
00:14:57,272 --> 00:14:58,652
Let us pray

178
00:14:58,653 --> 00:15:01,466
Oh, lord, bless the food
we are going to eat. Amen.

179
00:15:01,468 --> 00:15:02,767
Amen.

180
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:05,503
Mom, I'm satisfied.

181
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:07,572
You have my share, mom.

182
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:10,008
I'm satisfied, mom.

183
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:11,943
You have eaten.

184
00:15:11,945 --> 00:15:13,578
How?

185
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:14,913
Hmm...

186
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:18,583
You better not be
eating the maize.

187
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,510
Look, the fire glows

188
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:33,631
Yes! Yes, I beat you.

189
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:36,768
Aha! The pig has had a bath.

190
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:39,570
Joseph,
you're playing with fire.

191
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:40,939
Quiet, Benjamin.

192
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:42,040
Coach.

193
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:45,743
Coach calls it promoting.

194
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:48,112
But I call it queening.

195
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:51,749
When you scoot little man
down the board...

196
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:54,185
Square by square...

197
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:56,621
When he reaches the back rank...

198
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,091
He becomes...

199
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:03,194
Mmm?

200
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:05,129
A queen.

201
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:08,132
In chess...

202
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:12,570
The small one
can become the big one.

203
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:15,139
That's why I like it.

204
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:16,941
Hmm.

205
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:25,416
You take care of Richard.

206
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:27,952
I'm going to find night.

207
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,344
Phiona!

208
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:56,047
Phiona!
Mmm?

209
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:00,785
Night.
Come.

210
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:03,154
Night?

211
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:06,357
Mother just went
to look for you.

212
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:07,992
Here.

213
00:17:07,994 --> 00:17:09,527
Where did you get this?

214
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,729
I told you.
Theo is kind hearted.

215
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:15,666
You are not staying with him,
are you, night?

216
00:17:15,668 --> 00:17:19,871
Mother stayed with a man.
In a few years, so shall you.

217
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:22,740
No, no, no. Not me.

218
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:26,110
Night...

219
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:29,680
Do you think god wants
bad fortune for us?

220
00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:31,349
Why would you say this?

221
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:34,886
Because since papa and Juliet
passed away...

222
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:37,422
It seems he is angry with us.

223
00:17:37,424 --> 00:17:39,624
I don't think
god cares about us,

224
00:17:39,626 --> 00:17:41,559
one way or the other.

225
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:50,334
Bye, my sister.

226
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:04,082
Ivan, when you fetch water
for your mother...

227
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:06,317
Do you just go
any time of the day?

228
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:08,086
Or do you think a bit first?

229
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:09,954
I think a bit.
About what?

230
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:12,957
There are long lines
for water in the morning,

231
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:14,625
so I plan when I will go.

232
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:15,693
Ah! A plan.

233
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:17,662
And I cannot arrive
too late because

234
00:18:17,664 --> 00:18:19,864
I could get robbed
on the way home.

235
00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:20,765
So, on my way,

236
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,533
I cut through the valley
to save time.

237
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:24,102
And what happens
when the rain comes?

238
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:25,603
The waters come down the hill.

239
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:26,904
And do you get washed away?

240
00:18:26,906 --> 00:18:28,706
No, I climb in my hammock.

241
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:31,275
Your hammock! Good plan.

242
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:34,612
Threats from many directions.

243
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,014
Robbers.

244
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:39,283
Angry property owners.

245
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:41,319
Floods.

246
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:43,788
And other dangers.

247
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:48,926
How can this bishop survive?

248
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:55,633
Coach, no way.

249
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,535
Eh, eh, eh. Look.

250
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:59,937
Look at it closely.

251
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:05,109
F-3?

252
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:07,612
Yes, f-3.

253
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,013
He is safe there.

254
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:11,482
Yes. In today's game...

255
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:15,119
Bishop is safe on f-3.

256
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:16,988
When you first looked
at this position...

257
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:20,958
Perhaps you thought there was
no safe haven for bishop.

258
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,126
But, you looked closely.

259
00:19:22,128 --> 00:19:25,763
You analyzed the threats.
You made a plan.

260
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:27,965
And bishop found safety, eh?

261
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:29,834
Use your minds.

262
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:31,169
Follow your plans.

263
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:34,539
And you will all find
safe squares.

264
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:39,277
Me, teacher!
Me, teacher! Me, teacher!

265
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:40,845
Nearly two million years ago...

266
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:45,516
East Africans were the first
to master the use of fire.

267
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:50,321
So, were we the first
to eat kikomando?

268
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:55,826
Hey.
Hey.

269
00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:58,563
The beautiful
Mrs. Katende.

270
00:19:58,565 --> 00:20:00,331
Hello.

271
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:04,735
Some days ago, this girl, Phiona,
came for the first time.

272
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:06,771
She was not clean.

273
00:20:06,773 --> 00:20:09,974
Ivan and the boys
teased her very badly.

274
00:20:09,976 --> 00:20:12,677
Ivan is not
Mr. clean himself.

275
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:15,713
So? Did she run home?

276
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:17,848
No. She stayed.

277
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,951
She came back all cleaned up.

278
00:20:19,953 --> 00:20:21,185
She is stubborn.

279
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:23,921
Sounds like someone I know.

280
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:27,925
Hi.

281
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:31,963
Oh!

282
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,699
She needs new clothes.

283
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:38,069
I can get some from my sister.

284
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:41,872
This ministry salary
is not enough for us, eh?

285
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:43,608
It is okay for now.

286
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,610
I did not come first
in my university

287
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:47,144
for my wife to pay the rent.

288
00:20:47,146 --> 00:20:48,679
It is not okay.

289
00:20:48,681 --> 00:20:52,883
She must have more certainty
than I did as a child.

290
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:56,554
She doesn't live
in the bush, Robert.

291
00:20:56,556 --> 00:20:58,723
There is no war now.

292
00:20:58,725 --> 00:21:00,691
Dig, dig, dig.

293
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:03,694
Digging to plant.
Digging to eat.

294
00:21:03,696 --> 00:21:05,730
Digging graves.

295
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:08,833
She must never have to
dig as I did.

296
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:53,978
Checkmate.

297
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:58,182
How'd you do that?

298
00:21:58,184 --> 00:22:00,818
You will never beat me, sister.

299
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:12,263
Mmm-hmm.

300
00:22:12,265 --> 00:22:14,231
East African sewerage
company. Good morning.

301
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:16,434
<i>Who is your family?</i>

302
00:22:16,436 --> 00:22:18,069
Would I know them?

303
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:21,739
I lost them at a young age, sir.

304
00:22:21,741 --> 00:22:23,341
Ah, sorry.

305
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:26,877
Nevertheless,
you had the highest grades

306
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:27,978
in your it class.

307
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:31,849
You are highly qualified.
And honest, it seems.

308
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:32,450
Yes, sir.

309
00:22:32,452 --> 00:22:34,985
I must warn you,
a man with integrity

310
00:22:34,987 --> 00:22:36,187
in a water company...

311
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:38,889
Is as rare as a white rhino.

312
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:46,997
I need someone like you.

313
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:50,034
Give me some time
to find an opening.

314
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:53,170
But we are going to
get you in here.

315
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:54,825
Count on me

316
00:22:55,042 --> 00:22:56,212
Thank you, sir

317
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:06,350
Joseph, why are you
letting her win?

318
00:23:06,352 --> 00:23:07,852
I'm not letting her!

319
00:23:07,854 --> 00:23:09,587
She won your bishop.

320
00:23:09,589 --> 00:23:12,022
What I'm seeing cannot be true.

321
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:25,903
Ah!

322
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:36,447
Huh?

323
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:41,786
Checkmate!

324
00:23:41,788 --> 00:23:43,754
She won! She won!

325
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:44,488
Phiona has won!

326
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,757
Hey, Joseph,
you are not serious?

327
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:49,026
A girl has given you checkmate.

328
00:23:49,028 --> 00:23:50,561
Yeah. What?

329
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:57,034
Sorry. I'm just
a lucky beginner.

330
00:23:57,036 --> 00:24:00,237
I will never,
ever play you again.

331
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:06,944
Phiona.

332
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:10,781
Where did you learn
those end moves?

333
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,583
Did you look at
one of my books here?

334
00:24:12,585 --> 00:24:16,120
Me, I don't know
how to read books.

335
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:17,655
Hmm.

336
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:23,994
So, you just reasoned out that
end position on your own?

337
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,564
Coach.

338
00:24:26,566 --> 00:24:28,766
When shall we play
other children?

339
00:24:28,768 --> 00:24:30,534
Ivan is here. Play him.

340
00:24:30,536 --> 00:24:34,138
We want to play other boys.
The ones you talked of.

341
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,940
City boys.

342
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:37,775
City boys, eh?

343
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:05,236
Sir.

344
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:08,172
I already sent him away once.

345
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:11,475
But he came back.

346
00:25:14,312 --> 00:25:16,547
Okay, send him in.

347
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:23,754
Katende. Slum children?

348
00:25:23,756 --> 00:25:25,856
No, no, no, no.

349
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:27,291
We can't have that.

350
00:25:27,293 --> 00:25:28,826
Why not, sir?

351
00:25:28,828 --> 00:25:30,561
No, no. No.

352
00:25:30,563 --> 00:25:34,698
See, we hold the father
grimes tournament...

353
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,934
At king's college.

354
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,270
At budo.

355
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:42,206
It's a very clean
and formal place.

356
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:45,609
But their skill levels
are improving very fast.

357
00:25:45,611 --> 00:25:46,810
And I'm sure that...

358
00:25:46,812 --> 00:25:48,112
Not their skill.

359
00:25:48,114 --> 00:25:49,547
No, no.

360
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:52,416
We have a dinner.

361
00:25:52,418 --> 00:25:54,451
It is a tournament. Correct?

362
00:25:54,453 --> 00:25:55,719
Ah...

363
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:58,455
I'm a visitor
at the budo campus.

364
00:25:58,457 --> 00:26:01,458
I cannot bring a disease
into this school.

365
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:04,028
My children
do not have diseases.

366
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:06,931
That we know of.
That we know of.

367
00:26:06,933 --> 00:26:10,134
No, no, no. No, no.
I'm sorry. No!

368
00:26:10,136 --> 00:26:12,102
You have many "noes",
Mr. chairman.

369
00:26:12,104 --> 00:26:15,239
I wish to turn your "noes"
into "yeses", huh?

370
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:20,244
But they're not in school.
Correct?

371
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:23,213
It is true
that most of our children

372
00:26:23,215 --> 00:26:24,281
cannot afford school.

373
00:26:24,283 --> 00:26:27,251
This is
a school tournament. See?

374
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:29,587
For schools.

375
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:33,657
Cannot my Katwe players
come as guest participants?

376
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:35,893
Yet, the fees.

377
00:26:35,895 --> 00:26:39,463
It's 4,000 shillings per child.

378
00:26:39,465 --> 00:26:41,665
Your children could afford this?

379
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:43,500
Likely not.

380
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:46,070
I understand.
Ah.

381
00:26:46,072 --> 00:26:47,638
Thank you for your efforts.

382
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,139
And I thank you
for committing to me

383
00:26:49,141 --> 00:26:50,741
that if I raise the money
for their fees...

384
00:26:50,743 --> 00:26:52,042
You will admit
the Katwe children

385
00:26:52,044 --> 00:26:53,577
into the father grimes
tournament.

386
00:26:53,579 --> 00:26:55,079
Thank you, sir.

387
00:26:55,081 --> 00:26:56,313
Mr. Katende...

388
00:26:56,315 --> 00:26:57,414
Eesh!

389
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:09,326
Coach!

390
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:23,641
The other 5,000.
Perfect.

391
00:27:23,643 --> 00:27:26,110
Go get the others! Go!

392
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:51,935
Yes! Go, coach!

393
00:27:51,937 --> 00:27:52,937
Coach!

394
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,875
Coach, yes! Yes!

395
00:27:58,610 --> 00:27:59,610
Oh!

396
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:06,684
Coach! Yes, coach!

397
00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:10,521
Go, coach! Go!

398
00:28:19,297 --> 00:28:23,333
That was for budo!
Budo! Budo! Budo!

399
00:28:23,335 --> 00:28:26,704
Yes!
We are going to budo!

400
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:30,841
Budo! Budo! Budo!

401
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:32,376
Fees!

402
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,913
No, no, no. Please, no.

403
00:28:35,915 --> 00:28:37,514
Yes, yes, yes, please.

404
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:39,083
Yes.

405
00:28:42,488 --> 00:28:44,188
Sorry, sir.

406
00:28:46,324 --> 00:28:47,524
Eh!

407
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:54,231
Katende, are you playing
football for money again?

408
00:28:54,532 --> 00:28:55,065
Hmm?

409
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:57,634
Do you want to aggravate
your old injury?

410
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:00,370
Now you're getting me angry.

411
00:29:00,372 --> 00:29:01,338
Sara, I'm sorry.

412
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,773
I couldn't tell the children

413
00:29:02,775 --> 00:29:05,542
we don't have the fees
for budo, eh?

414
00:29:05,544 --> 00:29:07,745
I just couldn't.

415
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:10,481
Sorry, sorry, eh?

416
00:29:10,483 --> 00:29:11,715
Hmm.

417
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:14,551
Am I denied?

418
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:18,322
What did I say
when I proposed to you, eh?

419
00:29:18,324 --> 00:29:19,223
Not this again.

420
00:29:19,225 --> 00:29:22,626
"Give me ten reasons to
marry you," the woman said.

421
00:29:22,628 --> 00:29:24,228
And what did I say?

422
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:28,432
Reason one. "I love you."

423
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:33,137
Reason two.
Do you remember it?

424
00:29:33,139 --> 00:29:34,738
Yes, Robert.

425
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:37,341
"I love you."

426
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:39,409
Eh?
Hmm.

427
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:42,112
Reason three.

428
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:47,651
Shall I remind you of the rest?

429
00:29:50,055 --> 00:29:52,723
I am such a lucky woman.

430
00:29:52,725 --> 00:29:54,091
Hmm.
Hmm.

431
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:04,468
Ah! My neck.
Mmm?

432
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:06,103
I'm just joking.

433
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:18,415
Where do they go every day?

434
00:30:18,417 --> 00:30:19,550
You should be careful.

435
00:30:19,552 --> 00:30:21,351
They are just
selling their maize.

436
00:30:21,353 --> 00:30:23,320
Me, I know.
Those gamblers

437
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:25,489
give children porridge
in the valley.

438
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:29,393
Who knows how
they'll use your children.

439
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:52,816
Mmm-hmm.

440
00:30:52,818 --> 00:30:54,852
Benjamin, play.

441
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:21,378
Ha!

442
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:28,051
Checkmate.

443
00:31:31,423 --> 00:31:32,689
What?

444
00:31:33,424 --> 00:31:34,625
No.

445
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:37,361
This is not possible.

446
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:41,131
We have a new champion.

447
00:31:41,133 --> 00:31:42,499
Well done, Phiona.

448
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:51,875
Let me go back to my board.

449
00:31:53,512 --> 00:31:54,978
Well done.

450
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:02,920
Benjamin.

451
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:03,720
Ah!

452
00:32:03,722 --> 00:32:06,790
You are too mature
for such tears, ah?

453
00:32:06,792 --> 00:32:09,026
But I was champion.

454
00:32:09,028 --> 00:32:09,793
Oh.

455
00:32:09,795 --> 00:32:12,329
You will be champion again.

456
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:27,177
Hey!

457
00:32:27,712 --> 00:32:30,280
Hey! Madam!
Madam! Madam!

458
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:31,114
Hey!

459
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:34,251
These children are not helpers
for your gambling games!

460
00:32:34,253 --> 00:32:35,485
Madam, you misunderstand
our work.

461
00:32:35,487 --> 00:32:37,054
I know the work you men do.

462
00:32:37,056 --> 00:32:37,788
Let me explain.

463
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:41,391
If I find my children
here again, eh!

464
00:32:41,393 --> 00:32:42,926
You will see me.

465
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:50,467
Phiona's in trouble.

466
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:10,988
Phiona!

467
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:12,823
Mmm.

468
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:16,226
Coach! Mama, coach!

469
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:20,097
Coach! Coach!

470
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:22,799
Madam, may I speak with you?

471
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,101
It will only take a moment.

472
00:33:24,103 --> 00:33:25,736
Mama, please.
Talk to coach.

473
00:33:25,738 --> 00:33:27,504
Just a moment, eh?

474
00:33:41,886 --> 00:33:44,955
Coach will take us
to king's college.

475
00:33:44,957 --> 00:33:46,223
Yes!

476
00:33:46,225 --> 00:33:47,624
Chess is not gambling.

477
00:33:47,626 --> 00:33:48,291
Hmm...

478
00:33:48,293 --> 00:33:50,394
It is a game
of kings and queens.

479
00:33:50,396 --> 00:33:52,963
It teaches discipline
and mental strength.

480
00:33:52,965 --> 00:33:54,431
Work also teaches these things.

481
00:33:54,433 --> 00:33:56,833
But<i> Nnyabo,</i>
this is a chance for them

482
00:33:56,835 --> 00:33:59,236
to visit the finest school
in the country.

483
00:33:59,238 --> 00:34:01,004
How can I pay school fees?

484
00:34:01,006 --> 00:34:02,272
No need for that now.

485
00:34:02,274 --> 00:34:06,009
Your children are very vital
to our group.

486
00:34:06,011 --> 00:34:08,779
Brian is full of determination.

487
00:34:08,781 --> 00:34:12,149
But, your daughter, her
intelligence is very high.

488
00:34:12,151 --> 00:34:14,684
Perhaps the highest
among all my children.

489
00:34:14,686 --> 00:34:17,854
This opportunity could be
very valuable to her.

490
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:21,458
Allow your children to come
with us to king's college...

491
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:25,295
And I will find a way
for them to enter school, eh?

492
00:34:25,297 --> 00:34:26,830
You speak no sense.

493
00:34:26,832 --> 00:34:28,231
Let them come...

494
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:29,032
And when we return,

495
00:34:29,034 --> 00:34:30,167
I will put them
in private classes...

496
00:34:30,169 --> 00:34:32,402
With the best teacher
in Kampala.

497
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:38,075
Please, madam, eh?

498
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,680
I am allowing them.

499
00:34:43,682 --> 00:34:45,982
If you do not
keep your promise...

500
00:34:45,984 --> 00:34:47,751
You will never see
my children again.

501
00:34:47,753 --> 00:34:49,186
Okay.

502
00:34:49,188 --> 00:34:50,487
Yes!
Thank you, madam.

503
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:51,521
Mama, we are forever grateful!

504
00:34:51,523 --> 00:34:53,590
Thank you.

505
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,592
Thank you, coach!
We go to budo!

506
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:56,827
Let's go! Budo! Budo!

507
00:34:56,829 --> 00:34:58,295
Thank you, madam.

508
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,730
They are leaving me

509
00:35:04,062 --> 00:35:06,022
They are leaving me

510
00:35:19,494 --> 00:35:21,044
Dear Driver, go faster, faster

511
00:35:21,246 --> 00:35:22,866
Hey, faster, faster

512
00:35:23,165 --> 00:35:23,715
My people

513
00:35:24,082 --> 00:35:24,582
My people

514
00:35:24,833 --> 00:35:25,463
My people

515
00:35:25,751 --> 00:35:27,211
We're full of beans

516
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:33,463
Chicken.

517
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:22,379
Hello.

518
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:24,714
Hello.
How are you?

519
00:36:24,716 --> 00:36:26,516
Come. Come, pioneers.

520
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:29,886
Hello.

521
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:32,255
Welcome.

522
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:33,323
Oh...

523
00:36:33,325 --> 00:36:35,091
Mr. Barumba,
good morning.

524
00:37:00,017 --> 00:37:01,651
We are drawn together...

525
00:37:01,653 --> 00:37:06,556
By our love
for this game of strategy...

526
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:08,892
Which strengthens our minds...

527
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:11,995
And prepares us for our...

528
00:37:11,997 --> 00:37:14,965
Put it down.
Brian, put it down.

529
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:16,900
Ah!

530
00:37:17,468 --> 00:37:21,538
We welcome, also, some...

531
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,240
Underprivileged children.

532
00:37:23,242 --> 00:37:28,311
I'm sure we can show them
an example of good manners...

533
00:37:28,313 --> 00:37:33,450
To take back with them
to their communities.

534
00:37:33,452 --> 00:37:35,819
Now, eat and enjoy.

535
00:37:35,821 --> 00:37:37,821
Cheers!

536
00:37:40,491 --> 00:37:42,092
Okay, okay, okay.

537
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:43,827
Not the...

538
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:46,463
Use the knife.

539
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:50,634
Gloria, pass me a glass.

540
00:37:51,802 --> 00:37:53,103
Ah!

541
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:38,114
Good night, my pioneers.

542
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:51,094
Good morning, pioneers!

543
00:38:51,096 --> 00:38:53,363
Good morning, coach.

544
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,835
I want to go home!

545
00:38:59,303 --> 00:39:00,870
Benjamin.

546
00:39:07,878 --> 00:39:10,013
Okay, okay, okay.
Breathe, breathe!

547
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:12,415
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

548
00:39:12,417 --> 00:39:14,317
I want my mum.

549
00:39:25,262 --> 00:39:26,196
Gloria.

550
00:39:26,198 --> 00:39:28,231
I don't want to play.

551
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:32,035
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

552
00:39:38,642 --> 00:39:41,811
On my way to the bus yesterday,

553
00:39:41,813 --> 00:39:43,380
I saw a skinny dog.

554
00:39:43,382 --> 00:39:45,882
The dog was hungry.

555
00:39:47,017 --> 00:39:48,318
He spied a cat.

556
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,588
Dog started to chase the cat
down the alley...

557
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:53,990
Through a puddle,
through a house.

558
00:39:53,992 --> 00:39:56,793
Cat even jumped
over a kettle fire! Ooh!

559
00:39:56,795 --> 00:40:00,997
And he was gone!
Dog collapsed on the floor.

560
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,602
Tired! I said,
"dog, what happened, eh?

561
00:40:05,604 --> 00:40:09,906
"You were so hungry,
and your dinner got away."

562
00:40:10,107 --> 00:40:14,644
Dog said to me,
"the problem is, me...

563
00:40:14,646 --> 00:40:16,880
"I was only running for a meal.

564
00:40:16,882 --> 00:40:20,083
"That cat was
running for her life."

565
00:40:22,453 --> 00:40:25,288
You see, these children...

566
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:28,024
They have nice clothes,
comfortable beds.

567
00:40:28,026 --> 00:40:32,529
They are like dog.
Everything comes very easy.

568
00:40:32,531 --> 00:40:34,631
But you...

569
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:36,766
My great cats, eh?

570
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:41,404
You are running...

571
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:45,942
For your lives. Eh?

572
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:55,251
Come, we pray.

573
00:41:02,527 --> 00:41:07,330
Dear father, we thank you
for this opportunity.

574
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:11,167
Help us to be
great today. Amen.

575
00:41:11,169 --> 00:41:12,368
Amen.

576
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:13,937
Come, we go.

577
00:41:51,742 --> 00:41:54,611
Coach, I cannot.

578
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:56,479
He is the best one.

579
00:41:56,481 --> 00:41:59,115
One of us has to
play this board.

580
00:41:59,117 --> 00:42:00,850
Why not you?

581
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:18,735
Welcome to the father grimes...

582
00:42:18,737 --> 00:42:22,872
National schools
chess championship.

583
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:25,375
Commence play, please.

584
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:42,892
Our father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

585
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:46,329
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done on earth.

586
00:43:12,556 --> 00:43:14,324
Call it a draw?

587
00:43:14,326 --> 00:43:15,758
No.

588
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:47,624
Sharp eye, little friend.

589
00:43:47,626 --> 00:43:51,661
I guess I've got a good fight
on my hands here.

590
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:17,587
Do you have another lollipop?

591
00:44:18,122 --> 00:44:19,322
Mmm-mmm.

592
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:25,194
Good strategy.

593
00:44:25,196 --> 00:44:29,966
Putting your weakest player
on the champion's board.

594
00:44:40,611 --> 00:44:42,512
Checkmate.

595
00:44:43,614 --> 00:44:44,981
What?

596
00:44:47,651 --> 00:44:50,119
Coach! Me, I did it.

597
00:44:50,121 --> 00:44:51,254
Checkmate.

598
00:44:51,256 --> 00:44:52,655
Hmm?

599
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:57,026
Benjamin.
Well done.

600
00:45:02,494 --> 00:45:05,004
Brian, we showed the Richie Riches

601
00:45:05,205 --> 00:45:06,865
Katwe Cool Cats

602
00:45:07,337 --> 00:45:08,805
Benjamin!

603
00:45:16,513 --> 00:45:18,915
She's up two pawns on Pritchard.

604
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:25,855
Checkmate.

605
00:45:31,795 --> 00:45:34,330
Coach!

606
00:45:34,698 --> 00:45:37,166
Gloria! What? What is it?
What is it?

607
00:45:37,168 --> 00:45:39,335
He took my queen!

608
00:45:39,337 --> 00:45:40,703
Please...

609
00:45:40,705 --> 00:45:42,038
He took my queen!

610
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,473
No!
Okay, okay.

611
00:45:43,475 --> 00:45:45,775
He took my queen!
Girl. Shh!

612
00:45:46,009 --> 00:45:48,344
He took my queen!
Please, please. Gloria!

613
00:45:48,346 --> 00:45:51,414
He took my queen!
Gloria! Shh!

614
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:52,949
My queen!
Shh!

615
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:07,964
Draw.

616
00:46:07,966 --> 00:46:10,266
No.
Draw!

617
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:14,771
Ah!

618
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:20,443
Pritchard!
Pritchard! Pritchard!

619
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:40,530
None of your sneak attacks.

620
00:46:40,532 --> 00:46:42,899
This is not the ghetto.

621
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:48,838
I don't need to sneak.

622
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:12,195
<i>She surrounds you
until you have nowhere to go.</i>

623
00:47:12,729 --> 00:47:15,531
<i>And then squeezes you
like a python.</i>

624
00:47:15,533 --> 00:47:16,699
Checkmate.

625
00:47:16,701 --> 00:47:21,871
Such aggressiveness in a girl
is quite a treasure.

626
00:47:25,576 --> 00:47:27,510
As a member
of the governing body

627
00:47:27,512 --> 00:47:29,345
of the Uganda
chess federation...

628
00:47:29,347 --> 00:47:31,714
It is my honor
to award a medal...

629
00:47:31,716 --> 00:47:34,917
To a girl who plays
with astonishing power.

630
00:47:34,919 --> 00:47:37,119
This year's
Budoan gold medalist...

631
00:47:37,121 --> 00:47:41,657
Is from the children's team
of Katwe, Phiona Mutesi.

632
00:47:52,936 --> 00:47:56,906
Children's team!
Children's team!

633
00:48:01,778 --> 00:48:02,979
Yes!

634
00:48:04,915 --> 00:48:06,883
We won, yes!

635
00:48:09,353 --> 00:48:12,955
Coach, did that boy let me win?

636
00:48:12,957 --> 00:48:14,790
He did not let you win, Phiona.

637
00:48:14,792 --> 00:48:15,458
You defeated him.

638
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:19,228
How could I win a boy
who goes to school here?

639
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:22,098
You defeated him.

640
00:48:22,332 --> 00:48:23,532
Mmm?

641
00:48:24,201 --> 00:48:25,768
I think it's time
for you to meet

642
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:28,938
the best teacher in Kampala.

643
00:48:31,008 --> 00:48:35,011
Children's team!
Children's team!

644
00:48:56,366 --> 00:48:58,601
I had no master teachers.

645
00:48:58,603 --> 00:49:01,270
These taught me to play.

646
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:02,772
With books,
it's like the teacher

647
00:49:02,774 --> 00:49:03,706
lives inside the pages...

648
00:49:03,708 --> 00:49:07,143
And you can visit them
whenever you wish.

649
00:49:07,145 --> 00:49:08,344
Sara loves books.

650
00:49:08,346 --> 00:49:12,481
I wish I could take all
the knowledge inside here...

651
00:49:12,483 --> 00:49:15,217
And just put it in my head.

652
00:49:16,353 --> 00:49:20,256
Would you like to know
how to read this book?

653
00:49:24,695 --> 00:49:26,062
You see that?

654
00:49:26,064 --> 00:49:28,831
That is the word "chess."

655
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:31,200
You play the game.

656
00:49:31,202 --> 00:49:33,202
Why not read the words?

657
00:49:33,204 --> 00:49:35,771
Each letter makes a sound.

658
00:49:35,773 --> 00:49:39,508
Your coach was hoping
we would become friends.

659
00:49:40,244 --> 00:49:43,179
I think that we will.

660
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:46,682
Have some tea.

661
00:49:55,225 --> 00:49:56,759
"Chess."

662
00:50:10,941 --> 00:50:12,942
Stop, stop, stop!

663
00:50:13,514 --> 00:50:14,514
You!

664
00:50:14,598 --> 00:50:15,598
Corn boy

665
00:50:16,141 --> 00:50:17,141
Come

666
00:50:21,786 --> 00:50:23,152
Brian!

667
00:50:23,587 --> 00:50:26,722
Brian! My brother! Brian!

668
00:50:26,724 --> 00:50:28,657
Brother.

669
00:50:31,162 --> 00:50:32,561
Please help!

670
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:35,798
Brother! Brother!

671
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,066
Please help!

672
00:50:40,604 --> 00:50:41,670
My brother is hurt!

673
00:50:41,672 --> 00:50:43,739
Can you take us to the hospital?

674
00:50:43,741 --> 00:50:44,874
Mmm-mmm.

675
00:50:44,876 --> 00:50:46,675
I have money!
I have money!

676
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:52,448
Mama! Mama!

677
00:50:53,818 --> 00:50:56,318
Brian had an accident!

678
00:51:01,626 --> 00:51:02,992
Mom.
Ay.

679
00:51:04,761 --> 00:51:06,162
Shakira!

680
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:08,597
Take Richard.
Okay.

681
00:51:15,472 --> 00:51:18,007
Your card in the hand, please.

682
00:51:21,278 --> 00:51:23,145
The wound goes
from here to the bone.

683
00:51:23,147 --> 00:51:26,282
I can stitch him, but we have
no more pain medicine...

684
00:51:26,284 --> 00:51:28,451
And will not for another day.

685
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:31,687
Another day?

686
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:37,793
You stitch him.

687
00:51:37,795 --> 00:51:40,563
No, mama. No!

688
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:48,304
Mama!

689
00:51:48,306 --> 00:51:49,738
My god. Please.

690
00:52:01,551 --> 00:52:02,618
Madam Harriet.
Yes.

691
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:05,287
I'll come to discuss
your bill now now.

692
00:52:05,289 --> 00:52:06,989
No problem.

693
00:52:09,426 --> 00:52:10,960
- Richard.
- Mmm-hmm.

694
00:52:10,962 --> 00:52:13,462
You're the man remaining
in our family.

695
00:52:14,092 --> 00:52:16,333
Bring me maize and cake

696
00:52:16,334 --> 00:52:17,933
Me, I'm down.

697
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:21,003
But I'm not out.

698
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:25,474
My son, can you walk?

699
00:52:28,411 --> 00:52:30,613
Take Richard.

700
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:50,666
Put on your shoes.

701
00:52:51,234 --> 00:52:53,602
Go. Take him.
Where?

702
00:52:53,604 --> 00:52:54,904
Walk to the entrance.

703
00:52:54,906 --> 00:52:56,772
Go. Now, now, now.

704
00:53:15,625 --> 00:53:17,793
Oh! Hey.

705
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:22,331
Sit here.

706
00:53:24,434 --> 00:53:24,967
Mrs. Kimbale.

707
00:53:24,969 --> 00:53:28,737
I will have 10,000,
or that door will not open.

708
00:53:28,739 --> 00:53:29,138
Of course.

709
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:31,373
The money you earned.
I need it now now, Phiona.

710
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:33,642
I gave it to the man
on the boda boda.

711
00:53:33,644 --> 00:53:34,243
You gave him our money!

712
00:53:34,245 --> 00:53:38,514
I had to! Because he would not
take Brian without it, mama.

713
00:53:39,217 --> 00:53:42,418
If I were you,
I would find a man.

714
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:45,554
There are plenty
of sugar daddies...

715
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:47,556
Who'd want to pay your rent.

716
00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:50,926
That is not my business,
Mrs. Kimbale.

717
00:53:50,994 --> 00:53:52,194
Eh?

718
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:55,497
Too superior, are we?

719
00:53:55,499 --> 00:53:57,566
Better than all of us?

720
00:54:00,537 --> 00:54:03,339
Mrs. Kimbale.
Take advantage of me...

721
00:54:03,341 --> 00:54:05,107
Mrs. Kimbale...

722
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:09,044
Brian was in the hospital!

723
00:54:09,713 --> 00:54:11,247
No rent.

724
00:54:12,616 --> 00:54:13,616
No house.

725
00:54:14,171 --> 00:54:15,171
Have mercy

726
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:18,754
Where will we go?

727
00:54:19,889 --> 00:54:24,426
I beg you, please!
For my children!

728
00:54:48,018 --> 00:54:49,985
How much was it I take?

729
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:54,523
Shut up, you drunkard.
Shut up.

730
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:34,963
Why did you go?

731
00:55:43,907 --> 00:55:47,042
You make our plan, mama.

732
00:55:48,745 --> 00:55:49,978
Come.

733
00:56:14,804 --> 00:56:16,605
Coach, there.

734
00:56:21,578 --> 00:56:23,579
Who is hungry, eh?
Coach!

735
00:56:23,581 --> 00:56:25,247
I don't want to eat alone.

736
00:56:28,284 --> 00:56:29,618
For you.

737
00:56:29,652 --> 00:56:32,020
Hey, my friend.

738
00:56:32,088 --> 00:56:34,523
You are back in action, eh?

739
00:56:41,531 --> 00:56:42,698
So, you told the others

740
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:44,500
you are not coming back
to chess, eh?

741
00:56:44,502 --> 00:56:46,335
Why?
There are too many problems.

742
00:56:46,337 --> 00:56:49,938
But chess helps us
solve problems, isn't it?

743
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:51,306
Brian.

744
00:56:51,708 --> 00:56:54,543
Set a game for you and I.

745
00:57:12,662 --> 00:57:13,896
Check.

746
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:20,436
No, no. Phiona!

747
00:57:20,438 --> 00:57:22,337
Never tip your king so quick.

748
00:57:22,339 --> 00:57:26,375
Why not? When you're
going to be beaten anyway.

749
00:57:26,377 --> 00:57:27,643
Look.

750
00:57:28,678 --> 00:57:29,912
Focus on what you have.

751
00:57:29,914 --> 00:57:34,016
Coach, I think
you don't come from here.

752
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:39,988
When I was a child,
my mother left me.

753
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:43,792
In that moment I wanted to die.

754
00:57:43,794 --> 00:57:46,728
But it is a good thing
I did not take my life, eh?

755
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:49,231
Otherwise I would not have
seen my daughter.

756
00:57:49,233 --> 00:57:52,434
I would not have
met the pioneers.

757
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:54,303
Or you.

758
00:57:54,305 --> 00:57:55,604
Me?

759
00:57:57,974 --> 00:58:02,845
Do not be quick
to tip your king, Phiona.

760
00:58:03,446 --> 00:58:05,514
You must never surrender.

761
00:58:07,951 --> 00:58:09,151
Huh?

762
00:58:27,203 --> 00:58:28,437
Phiona.

763
00:58:28,938 --> 00:58:30,205
What are you doing?

764
00:58:30,207 --> 00:58:31,707
Playing my game.

765
00:58:31,709 --> 00:58:33,108
What game?

766
00:58:33,110 --> 00:58:37,045
Nothing, mama. Just dreams.

767
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:39,114
Theo, stop.

768
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:42,384
Night!

769
00:58:42,386 --> 00:58:43,819
Phiona!

770
00:58:46,624 --> 00:58:48,257
Phiona.

771
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:49,558
Oh, my god.

772
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:50,792
Night.

773
00:58:50,794 --> 00:58:54,229
I came because I heard
that you were evicted.

774
00:58:56,599 --> 00:58:59,067
Why are you dressed...

775
00:58:59,069 --> 00:59:00,569
Like a girl selling herself?

776
00:59:00,571 --> 00:59:03,071
Don't look if you don't like
what you see.

777
00:59:03,073 --> 00:59:04,439
I can look away...

778
00:59:04,441 --> 00:59:07,509
But god still sees what you do.

779
00:59:07,911 --> 00:59:09,378
Phiona, I'm going.

780
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:10,412
Yes, you go.

781
00:59:10,414 --> 00:59:12,548
And make children
you can't pay for.

782
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:13,315
Like you did.

783
00:59:13,317 --> 00:59:15,851
Mama, don't fight her, please.

784
00:59:15,853 --> 00:59:17,586
Don't.

785
00:59:17,588 --> 00:59:19,288
Take this money, Phiona.

786
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:23,859
Our mama is too proud to accept.

787
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:26,762
Night?

788
00:59:27,263 --> 00:59:30,966
Can you please stay
for a bit? Please?

789
00:59:30,968 --> 00:59:32,200
No.

790
00:59:59,462 --> 01:00:03,398
Mom? You must take
this money.

791
01:00:03,666 --> 01:00:05,033
For food.

792
01:00:05,702 --> 01:00:08,470
Maybe even for a house.

793
01:00:10,006 --> 01:00:11,873
Can you accept?

794
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:36,665
What happened to your king?

795
01:00:37,233 --> 01:00:38,433
He is under attack.

796
01:00:38,435 --> 01:00:41,203
Makes it difficult
for him to castle.

797
01:00:41,205 --> 01:00:42,738
Hey! Hello, Brian.

798
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:45,540
Hey! Welcome back.

799
01:00:45,542 --> 01:00:46,742
Abdul, bring.

800
01:00:46,744 --> 01:00:47,643
Phiona.

801
01:00:47,645 --> 01:00:49,878
Brian, have a seat, have a seat.

802
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:51,246
Phiona, Phiona.

803
01:00:51,248 --> 01:00:51,980
Phiona.

804
01:00:51,982 --> 01:00:53,415
Hello, Florence.
Want some porridge?

805
01:00:53,417 --> 01:00:54,349
Have some porridge.

806
01:00:54,351 --> 01:00:55,817
How are you?
Nice to see you.

807
01:00:55,819 --> 01:00:57,452
Nice to see you too, coach.
Welcome back.

808
01:00:57,454 --> 01:01:00,455
Have some porridge, come.
Come and play, okay?

809
01:01:00,457 --> 01:01:02,724
We're all together now,
pioneers.

810
01:01:02,726 --> 01:01:04,326
Commence play.

811
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:20,642
Checkmate.

812
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:57,779
Ivan, you're really
good at math.

813
01:01:59,282 --> 01:02:02,918
Phiona, can you read that
for me?

814
01:02:04,253 --> 01:02:06,788
"A crocodile...
Mmm-hmm.

815
01:02:07,523 --> 01:02:09,324
"has many teeth."

816
01:02:19,235 --> 01:02:22,270
But I did that
in the middle game.

817
01:02:22,839 --> 01:02:24,639
Knight to g-5.

818
01:02:25,141 --> 01:02:27,576
Pawn to h-4.

819
01:02:27,578 --> 01:02:30,345
<i>Pawn to c-3.</i>

820
01:02:38,855 --> 01:02:42,124
<i>Phiona, try as much as possible</i>

821
01:02:42,126 --> 01:02:43,391
<i>to avoid passive play.</i>

822
01:02:43,393 --> 01:02:45,961
You allowed him
to attack your castle.

823
01:02:45,963 --> 01:02:47,195
Your right squares were weak,

824
01:02:47,197 --> 01:02:50,632
and he capitalized on that
to capture your king.

825
01:02:50,634 --> 01:02:52,234
Checkmate.

826
01:02:56,739 --> 01:03:01,376
In tomorrow's game, make sure
you deny him a tempo...

827
01:03:01,378 --> 01:03:04,446
So he has to keep defending.

828
01:03:24,267 --> 01:03:28,203
Chess, it makes my brain sharp.

829
01:03:39,515 --> 01:03:41,616
Checkmate.
Yes.

830
01:03:41,618 --> 01:03:42,551
Yes!

831
01:03:42,553 --> 01:03:44,252
My great cats!

832
01:03:44,587 --> 01:03:46,121
You won a prize?

833
01:03:46,123 --> 01:03:47,455
For what?

834
01:03:47,457 --> 01:03:48,523
I won a boy.

835
01:03:48,525 --> 01:03:51,726
Best in boys, Phiona Mutesi.

836
01:03:51,728 --> 01:03:52,727
You won a boy?

837
01:03:52,729 --> 01:03:55,430
In fact, they named me best boy.

838
01:04:13,549 --> 01:04:16,551
Now, you know my plan
is to attack your b-5, yes?

839
01:04:16,553 --> 01:04:20,722
So you must bring your pawn
forward to defend. You see?

840
01:04:23,993 --> 01:04:26,761
Phiona, why are you
developing over here?

841
01:04:26,763 --> 01:04:28,496
Your problem is on b-5.

842
01:04:28,498 --> 01:04:31,032
Look! I put my pawn on b-5,

843
01:04:31,034 --> 01:04:33,168
you take my pawn,
my knight attacks your queen,

844
01:04:33,170 --> 01:04:35,871
we exchange queens, my
knight attacks your king...

845
01:04:35,873 --> 01:04:37,205
I take your rook.

846
01:04:37,207 --> 01:04:41,610
With respect, coach,
I would not move that way.

847
01:04:41,612 --> 01:04:42,344
You must.

848
01:04:42,346 --> 01:04:45,513
You are compelled
by my position.

849
01:04:59,228 --> 01:05:01,329
If you come for my knight...

850
01:05:01,331 --> 01:05:04,232
I attack your king
and take your rook.

851
01:05:04,234 --> 01:05:05,700
You see?

852
01:05:13,009 --> 01:05:15,844
You can see eight moves ahead?

853
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:30,792
You could win at Rwabushenyi.

854
01:05:31,027 --> 01:05:32,894
You could be the best
in all Uganda.

855
01:05:32,896 --> 01:05:36,097
Do you know what
that would mean for Katwe?

856
01:05:36,099 --> 01:05:38,300
Perhaps one day
an international champion.

857
01:05:38,302 --> 01:05:41,169
Coach!
Why are you shining me?

858
01:05:41,171 --> 01:05:41,903
Me, I'm not shining you.

859
01:05:41,905 --> 01:05:45,540
Only champions can see
that many variations.

860
01:05:46,242 --> 01:05:49,477
What is preventing you
from being a grandmaster?

861
01:05:49,479 --> 01:05:52,614
I do not know about
being a grandmaster.

862
01:05:52,616 --> 01:05:54,182
Sometimes, the place
you are used to

863
01:05:54,184 --> 01:05:55,917
is not the place you belong.

864
01:05:56,519 --> 01:05:59,921
You belong where
you believe you belong.

865
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:03,925
Where is that for you, Phiona?

866
01:06:06,295 --> 01:06:07,729
Huh?

867
01:06:11,934 --> 01:06:17,472
Assisting these children to
attend school is a noble goal,

868
01:06:17,474 --> 01:06:20,608
but it's outside the mandate
of our ministry.

869
01:06:20,610 --> 01:06:22,911
That mandate should be changed.

870
01:06:25,849 --> 01:06:29,250
Katende, you do not speak
any more

871
01:06:29,252 --> 01:06:32,854
like a man who has only
a part-time job.

872
01:06:32,856 --> 01:06:35,357
These children
have captured you.

873
01:06:40,863 --> 01:06:41,663
Mrs. Gali.

874
01:06:41,665 --> 01:06:44,032
<i>Robert, good news!</i>

875
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:45,066
<i>Your children are invited</i>

876
01:06:45,068 --> 01:06:48,436
<i>to the international chess
tournament in Sudan.</i>

877
01:06:48,438 --> 01:06:51,439
Sudan?
What is in the Sudan?

878
01:06:51,441 --> 01:06:53,675
Sudan is where
the African children's

879
01:06:53,677 --> 01:06:54,976
chess tournament is held.

880
01:06:54,978 --> 01:06:58,113
Children from all over
Africa will be there.

881
01:06:58,115 --> 01:07:01,082
It is sponsored
by the united nations.

882
01:07:03,219 --> 01:07:04,386
Is it not far?

883
01:07:04,388 --> 01:07:05,387
A thousand miles away.

884
01:07:05,389 --> 01:07:08,623
That bus of yours
would not get you there.

885
01:07:08,625 --> 01:07:10,759
I'm going to Sudan.

886
01:07:10,761 --> 01:07:12,727
There will be no bus this time.

887
01:07:12,729 --> 01:07:15,063
Phiona will travel by airplane

888
01:07:15,065 --> 01:07:19,167
with Ivan and Benjamin,
to represent Uganda.

889
01:07:19,635 --> 01:07:21,736
Think of that, eh?

890
01:07:22,304 --> 01:07:24,172
Katwe children, our children,

891
01:07:24,174 --> 01:07:25,407
representing the whole country.

892
01:07:25,409 --> 01:07:28,943
These two children
are not "our" children.

893
01:07:28,945 --> 01:07:29,944
They are my children.

894
01:07:29,946 --> 01:07:33,314
Of course. I just meant... Me,
I carried them in my body.

895
01:07:33,316 --> 01:07:35,350
Phiona is going in an airplane!

896
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:37,118
Ah...

897
01:07:39,321 --> 01:07:43,191
Richard,
Phiona is going to Sudan.

898
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:49,330
When they return...

899
01:07:49,332 --> 01:07:50,865
I have arranged
for Phiona and Brian

900
01:07:50,867 --> 01:07:53,368
to attend the school
where my wife teaches.

901
01:07:53,370 --> 01:07:54,235
Huh?

902
01:07:54,237 --> 01:07:55,703
On a scholarship.

903
01:07:55,705 --> 01:07:56,304
Eh?

904
01:07:56,306 --> 01:07:57,972
My wife has been
teaching them to read.

905
01:07:57,974 --> 01:08:02,377
Yes! Yes, I know,
and I am grateful, but...

906
01:08:03,712 --> 01:08:05,013
But what?

907
01:08:05,714 --> 01:08:08,850
Isn't this what you wanted?
Education for your children?

908
01:08:08,852 --> 01:08:12,754
Yes, but how can I pay
for uniforms?

909
01:08:12,756 --> 01:08:13,655
How will I save?

910
01:08:13,657 --> 01:08:14,989
What time does school
begin in the morning?

911
01:08:14,991 --> 01:08:17,859
Your children can do more
than sell vegetables.

912
01:08:17,861 --> 01:08:20,628
They have a chance to go
beyond this kind of life,

913
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:21,463
to go to school.

914
01:08:21,465 --> 01:08:22,864
Maybe one day attend university.

915
01:08:22,866 --> 01:08:26,434
Surely, you can understand
how important that is, eh?

916
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:30,371
Hmm.

917
01:08:30,739 --> 01:08:34,809
I am not an educated woman,
Mr. Katende.

918
01:08:35,211 --> 01:08:37,145
I understand nothing.

919
01:08:54,296 --> 01:08:56,698
<i>You want to go to this Sudan?</i>

920
01:08:56,700 --> 01:08:58,700
<i>Yes, mama.</i>

921
01:08:58,901 --> 01:09:01,402
You stay always near your coach.

922
01:09:01,404 --> 01:09:03,805
You do not know what
people there are like.

923
01:09:03,807 --> 01:09:04,839
Mama, bye.

924
01:09:04,841 --> 01:09:06,608
- Yes, lord...
- Bye, mama Phiona.

925
01:09:06,610 --> 01:09:09,444
I speak a blessing
on my daughter.

926
01:09:11,747 --> 01:09:14,382
Our father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

927
01:09:14,384 --> 01:09:16,851
Thy will be done on earth
as it is in heaven.

928
01:09:16,853 --> 01:09:18,553
Give us this day
our daily bread,

929
01:09:18,555 --> 01:09:20,188
and forgive us our...

930
01:09:22,224 --> 01:09:23,758
Bye, Benjamin.

931
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:25,260
Bye, Phiona.

932
01:09:25,262 --> 01:09:27,362
Bye, Ivan.

933
01:09:44,613 --> 01:09:48,049
Coach, is this heaven?

934
01:09:49,552 --> 01:09:53,621
No. Heaven is a bit higher.

935
01:10:02,631 --> 01:10:05,667
I've never before seen
an airport.

936
01:10:05,669 --> 01:10:08,269
I only have two sets of clothes.

937
01:10:08,271 --> 01:10:12,173
How am I going to win
these people over here?

938
01:10:13,422 --> 01:10:14,462
We are with you.

939
01:10:19,148 --> 01:10:20,448
Benjamin!

940
01:10:30,526 --> 01:10:34,329
Benjamin, come.
You also must practice.

941
01:10:35,030 --> 01:10:35,830
Go to Mozambique.

942
01:10:35,832 --> 01:10:40,368
Our coach trained in Moscow.
He's a grandmaster.

943
01:10:40,502 --> 01:10:42,537
He teaches students in Russia.

944
01:10:42,539 --> 01:10:46,174
He almost beat Kasparov.
Can you imagine?

945
01:10:46,176 --> 01:10:48,409
Coach said that
if I become a master,

946
01:10:48,411 --> 01:10:51,279
I may receive a stipend
from our federation

947
01:10:51,281 --> 01:10:53,314
simply to go to tournaments.

948
01:10:53,316 --> 01:10:55,450
What is it, a stipend?

949
01:10:55,452 --> 01:10:57,719
What is it?

950
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:59,487
Money, silly.

951
01:10:59,489 --> 01:11:01,422
Could I be a master?

952
01:11:01,424 --> 01:11:02,290
Eh?

953
01:11:02,292 --> 01:11:05,593
First, you have to win
50% of your games

954
01:11:05,595 --> 01:11:07,929
in a FIDE approved tournament.

955
01:11:07,931 --> 01:11:10,265
Like the Olympiad, in Russia.

956
01:11:10,267 --> 01:11:13,901
Have you ever heard of it? No.

957
01:11:29,752 --> 01:11:31,386
I'm beating this one.

958
01:11:31,388 --> 01:11:33,921
Mmm-mmm,
I'm beating this one.

959
01:11:44,933 --> 01:11:49,170
You don't know much, do you?

960
01:11:49,638 --> 01:11:51,539
I know a bit.

961
01:11:53,809 --> 01:11:55,109
Checkmate.

962
01:12:07,589 --> 01:12:08,723
I won him.

963
01:12:08,725 --> 01:12:10,425
I won my girl too.

964
01:12:10,427 --> 01:12:13,127
He's the best player.

965
01:12:16,432 --> 01:12:18,733
They must be tricking us.

966
01:12:19,802 --> 01:12:20,501
Coach?

967
01:12:20,503 --> 01:12:23,071
I think we can
win them tomorrow.

968
01:12:23,073 --> 01:12:25,206
They are over.

969
01:12:26,608 --> 01:12:29,977
And third place, Kenya.

970
01:12:32,848 --> 01:12:35,516
Second place, Sudan.

971
01:12:38,954 --> 01:12:42,657
And first place, Uganda!

972
01:12:45,594 --> 01:12:46,694
Yes!

973
01:12:46,696 --> 01:12:47,628
We won! Yes!

974
01:12:47,630 --> 01:12:51,499
My pioneers, you have won
an international tournament!

975
01:13:05,515 --> 01:13:08,383
We used to eat rice and
beans in the village.

976
01:13:08,385 --> 01:13:10,051
Look at what we're eating now.
Mmm, mmm!

977
01:13:10,053 --> 01:13:14,522
Ketchup is the greatest thing
that has ever been invented.

978
01:13:14,524 --> 01:13:17,492
I want a lake
filled with ketchup.

979
01:13:17,494 --> 01:13:19,761
Ha! Ivan, you are funny.

980
01:13:20,896 --> 01:13:22,263
Ketchup. Yes.
Cheers.

981
01:13:22,265 --> 01:13:24,031
Cheers.
Cheers.

982
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:31,973
Thank god!

983
01:13:32,454 --> 01:13:34,334
My daughter.

984
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:37,545
Thank god!

985
01:13:38,447 --> 01:13:39,680
They fed you?

986
01:13:39,682 --> 01:13:40,381
Yes, mama.

987
01:13:40,383 --> 01:13:43,518
Ah, I see you got another.

988
01:13:43,819 --> 01:13:44,919
Oh...

989
01:13:44,921 --> 01:13:47,622
I wish we could
eat these prizes.

990
01:13:47,624 --> 01:13:49,190
You come.

991
01:13:52,761 --> 01:13:54,629
What has happened?

992
01:13:56,131 --> 01:13:58,866
Theo got tired of her.

993
01:13:59,401 --> 01:14:01,869
She'll be fine.
You come and sit.

994
01:14:03,306 --> 01:14:05,440
Brian.

995
01:14:05,442 --> 01:14:07,675
Phiona.
Richard.

996
01:14:10,145 --> 01:14:12,847
How does it feel
to be in a plane?

997
01:14:12,849 --> 01:14:13,714
It is fine.

998
01:14:13,716 --> 01:14:15,783
How do you pee in a plane?

999
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:19,654
They have rooms inside the plane

1000
01:14:19,656 --> 01:14:21,189
with toilets in them.

1001
01:14:21,191 --> 01:14:22,256
You let her rest.

1002
01:14:22,258 --> 01:14:25,059
She's tired from her journey.

1003
01:14:25,327 --> 01:14:27,428
I'm sure that Sudan
does not have food

1004
01:14:27,430 --> 01:14:31,833
as sweet as your mother's
meat and matoke.

1005
01:14:54,590 --> 01:14:56,791
Welcome home,
miss Uganda of chess.

1006
01:14:56,793 --> 01:14:59,160
<i>You are bringing with you
the grand trophy.</i>

1007
01:14:59,162 --> 01:15:00,728
<i>Tell us how you did it.</i>

1008
01:15:00,730 --> 01:15:02,797
<i>Chess is a game of fighting.</i>

1009
01:15:02,799 --> 01:15:07,335
<i>Benjamin, Ivan, and me,
we are from Katwe.</i>

1010
01:15:07,337 --> 01:15:08,035
<i>We are fighters.</i>

1011
01:15:08,037 --> 01:15:10,705
<i>With more tournaments
around the corner,</i>

1012
01:15:10,707 --> 01:15:11,706
<i>I'm sure we'll be hearing</i>

1013
01:15:11,708 --> 01:15:13,107
<i>from these Katwe fighters
very soon.</i>

1014
01:15:13,109 --> 01:15:17,278
<i>But for now, we celebrate
this latest triumph.</i>

1015
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:18,479
Phiona!

1016
01:15:18,481 --> 01:15:22,216
Every time you bring home one
of those shiny trophies...

1017
01:15:22,218 --> 01:15:24,218
I'll give you a new hairstyle.

1018
01:15:27,089 --> 01:15:30,258
<i>You said your project</i>

1019
01:15:30,260 --> 01:15:33,661
<i>would make Phiona's
character stronger.</i>

1020
01:15:33,762 --> 01:15:36,297
Since you took her
to this Sudan,

1021
01:15:36,299 --> 01:15:38,866
she refuses to do
many of her tasks.

1022
01:15:38,868 --> 01:15:40,801
Wake up, Phiona.
Mmm-mmm.

1023
01:15:40,803 --> 01:15:43,104
Time to wash the cassava.

1024
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:46,173
It is improper
for the tournament winner

1025
01:15:46,175 --> 01:15:48,242
to wash cassava.

1026
01:15:48,443 --> 01:15:50,711
Who should wash them then?

1027
01:15:50,713 --> 01:15:53,047
Those of us who are
not tournament winners?

1028
01:15:53,049 --> 01:15:55,383
We're the cassava washers?
Is that it?

1029
01:15:55,385 --> 01:15:59,220
I am her mother.
And she should do as I say.

1030
01:15:59,222 --> 01:16:02,723
She believes your game will solve
every problem of her life.

1031
01:16:02,725 --> 01:16:07,962
Why not then let us
wash your feet, madam?

1032
01:16:09,932 --> 01:16:11,432
<i>When I was a girl...</i>

1033
01:16:11,434 --> 01:16:12,767
<i>I was told stories</i>

1034
01:16:12,769 --> 01:16:16,203
<i>of a village by the lake that
never runs short of maize.</i>

1035
01:16:16,205 --> 01:16:17,071
Come back here!

1036
01:16:17,073 --> 01:16:19,640
<i>Where there is no fighting.</i>

1037
01:16:19,642 --> 01:16:22,843
I never found that place,
Mr. Katende.

1038
01:16:22,845 --> 01:16:25,680
Your children deserve better.

1039
01:16:25,682 --> 01:16:27,481
Enough food to eat.

1040
01:16:27,483 --> 01:16:29,951
A roof over their heads.
Safety.

1041
01:16:29,953 --> 01:16:33,521
<i>You have shown
my children a paradise, yes.</i>

1042
01:16:33,523 --> 01:16:36,023
<i>But now they feel
out of place where they are.</i>

1043
01:16:36,025 --> 01:16:41,062
That girl from Egypt flies
to Russia to see her coach.

1044
01:16:41,064 --> 01:16:43,831
She has her own computer
to practice with.

1045
01:16:43,833 --> 01:16:46,834
She has biscuits.
She has clothings.

1046
01:16:46,836 --> 01:16:48,970
Why does this suddenly
bother you now?

1047
01:16:48,972 --> 01:16:50,605
Because I won that girl.

1048
01:16:50,607 --> 01:16:51,672
Coach, I won her!

1049
01:16:51,674 --> 01:16:54,408
They will not be able to
return to their old lives

1050
01:16:54,410 --> 01:16:56,544
because they have tasted yours.

1051
01:16:56,546 --> 01:17:01,015
<i>Not here, not there.
Like ghosts...</i>

1052
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:03,718
Who cannot rest.

1053
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:07,021
If that happens,
Mr. Katende...

1054
01:17:09,424 --> 01:17:12,493
I will hold you responsible.

1055
01:17:26,441 --> 01:17:29,944
You're wearing your
determined face, Robert.

1056
01:17:33,115 --> 01:17:38,252
Phiona has the talent
of a prodigy.

1057
01:17:38,254 --> 01:17:42,189
And me, I do not
have the experience

1058
01:17:42,191 --> 01:17:43,591
to properly train her.

1059
01:17:43,593 --> 01:17:45,993
Why should she be denied
the glory of victory

1060
01:17:45,995 --> 01:17:48,529
just because she was born here?

1061
01:18:00,142 --> 01:18:03,077
Bishop captures b-8.

1062
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:06,313
Put out the lamp, Phiona.

1063
01:18:06,315 --> 01:18:07,882
I have too much to learn.

1064
01:18:07,884 --> 01:18:10,818
You're going to finish
our paraffin.

1065
01:18:27,869 --> 01:18:32,106
Mama, chess allows me porridge.

1066
01:18:32,108 --> 01:18:33,908
But for Phiona...

1067
01:18:35,778 --> 01:18:37,244
She has just learned,

1068
01:18:37,246 --> 01:18:40,314
yet she is trapping people
on that board.

1069
01:18:40,916 --> 01:18:45,920
It is a good game about
escaping from this place.

1070
01:18:45,922 --> 01:18:47,621
Escape.

1071
01:18:47,956 --> 01:18:49,457
Hey!

1072
01:18:49,791 --> 01:18:52,860
To where? The villages?

1073
01:18:52,862 --> 01:18:58,132
I grew up there and my
stomach was always empty.

1074
01:18:59,067 --> 01:19:02,603
Mama, give Phiona
at least chance.

1075
01:20:13,508 --> 01:20:15,676
Mr. Nagenda.

1076
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:20,815
Eh... Harriet.

1077
01:20:20,817 --> 01:20:21,649
Hmm.

1078
01:20:21,651 --> 01:20:22,950
You remember my name?

1079
01:20:23,419 --> 01:20:27,221
The only name from that
village worth remembering.

1080
01:20:27,828 --> 01:20:29,578
It's been a long time

1081
01:20:30,525 --> 01:20:31,492
Eh...

1082
01:20:31,494 --> 01:20:34,395
I heard you lost your husband.

1083
01:20:34,397 --> 01:20:35,429
Yes.

1084
01:20:35,431 --> 01:20:36,330
I'm sorry.

1085
01:20:36,332 --> 01:20:38,032
Hmm.
Mmm.

1086
01:20:40,635 --> 01:20:43,370
Have you remarried?

1087
01:20:58,286 --> 01:21:02,890
Let me take you to, uh,
calendar hotel.

1088
01:21:02,892 --> 01:21:04,558
Eh?

1089
01:21:05,894 --> 01:21:07,228
For dinner.

1090
01:21:08,264 --> 01:21:11,832
They make excellent
grilled meat.

1091
01:21:13,201 --> 01:21:16,370
It is not grilled meat
I need today.

1092
01:21:16,372 --> 01:21:18,639
Hmm...

1093
01:21:18,907 --> 01:21:21,976
I have come to sell you
this piece.

1094
01:21:24,346 --> 01:21:26,881
My mother gave it to me.

1095
01:21:26,883 --> 01:21:28,249
Then, um...

1096
01:21:29,017 --> 01:21:31,652
Then I'm sure its value
to you would be

1097
01:21:31,654 --> 01:21:33,954
more than its value to me.

1098
01:21:33,956 --> 01:21:35,456
How much can you offer?

1099
01:21:36,459 --> 01:21:39,026
I don't want to insult you.

1100
01:21:40,862 --> 01:21:43,564
That would trouble me.

1101
01:21:43,566 --> 01:21:45,165
Sometimes...

1102
01:21:46,735 --> 01:21:49,103
We must take a risk,

1103
01:21:49,337 --> 01:21:52,339
mustn't we, tendo?

1104
01:21:57,279 --> 01:21:58,545
Perhaps.

1105
01:22:00,081 --> 01:22:02,549
12,000 shillings.

1106
01:22:02,884 --> 01:22:03,851
Mmm-hmm?

1107
01:22:03,853 --> 01:22:07,187
You meant to say 15, didn't you?

1108
01:22:07,189 --> 01:22:10,124
No, I meant to say 100.

1109
01:22:10,892 --> 01:22:14,862
If it might win me
your company...

1110
01:22:15,630 --> 01:22:17,298
Over dinner.

1111
01:22:25,507 --> 01:22:28,475
The 12,000 will do.

1112
01:22:35,122 --> 01:22:36,292
Greetings, madame

1113
01:22:36,623 --> 01:22:37,173
And to you, madame

1114
01:22:37,374 --> 01:22:38,754
Paraffin, please

1115
01:22:42,671 --> 01:22:43,671
Thanks

1116
01:23:31,606 --> 01:23:33,874
Mama...
Hmm?

1117
01:23:34,776 --> 01:23:40,147
Has anyone from Katwe
become a city person?

1118
01:23:43,818 --> 01:23:47,488
Don't think about
such things, Phiona.

1119
01:23:49,090 --> 01:23:50,657
Why not?

1120
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:54,661
Because if you do...
Mmm-hmm.

1121
01:23:58,900 --> 01:24:00,901
You will be disappointed.

1122
01:24:00,903 --> 01:24:02,736
Mama...
Mmm?

1123
01:24:02,904 --> 01:24:06,673
I will give you a house one day.

1124
01:24:22,557 --> 01:24:23,290
Coach!
Hey.

1125
01:24:23,292 --> 01:24:25,459
Phiona knows the moves
I will play.

1126
01:24:25,461 --> 01:24:27,494
She is reading my mind.

1127
01:24:30,698 --> 01:24:33,667
Don't they call
such people masters?

1128
01:24:33,669 --> 01:24:34,968
Eh, Phiona, be humble.

1129
01:24:34,970 --> 01:24:37,838
Come on, coach.
Masters get stipends.

1130
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:41,608
Yes, but you have to play
big people. Adults.

1131
01:24:41,709 --> 01:24:43,010
We will see.

1132
01:24:43,012 --> 01:24:45,979
The chess Olympiad in Russia?

1133
01:24:45,981 --> 01:24:51,718
Phiona, we are all very, very
happy that you qualified.

1134
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:56,023
The ministry, all of us,
wish to support you, but...

1135
01:24:56,025 --> 01:24:59,359
Phiona, even if, between us,

1136
01:24:59,361 --> 01:25:02,596
we could somehow
find the funds...

1137
01:25:02,598 --> 01:25:05,399
Isn't this a bit premature?

1138
01:25:05,733 --> 01:25:10,137
Premature, yes. Yes.

1139
01:25:13,741 --> 01:25:18,312
If I score 50%
at the chess Olympiad...

1140
01:25:18,314 --> 01:25:21,148
I can qualify as a master.

1141
01:25:23,485 --> 01:25:25,052
I want to be a master

1142
01:25:25,054 --> 01:25:27,254
more than anything in the world.

1143
01:25:27,256 --> 01:25:31,125
It would be good
for the chess federation

1144
01:25:31,127 --> 01:25:33,427
and for my family.

1145
01:25:36,564 --> 01:25:37,664
<i>Welcome aboard.</i>

1146
01:25:37,666 --> 01:25:39,399
<i>Flying time from Moscow
to Khanty-Mansiysk</i>

1147
01:25:39,401 --> 01:25:40,868
<i>will be 3 hours and 10 minutes.</i>

1148
01:25:40,870 --> 01:25:42,569
<i>We welcome
all the chess Olympiad teams</i>

1149
01:25:42,571 --> 01:25:44,371
<i>flying with us today.</i>
Spasibo.

1150
01:25:44,373 --> 01:25:46,573
Phiona, remember.

1151
01:25:46,575 --> 01:25:48,075
The middle-game tricks
you like,

1152
01:25:48,077 --> 01:25:51,178
the sacrifices, the quick mates.

1153
01:25:51,180 --> 01:25:52,513
Without good pawn structures,

1154
01:25:52,515 --> 01:25:55,115
much of this will be
unavailable to you.

1155
01:25:56,284 --> 01:25:58,385
Why are you nervous, coach?

1156
01:25:58,387 --> 01:26:01,021
The queen will help me to win.

1157
01:26:01,023 --> 01:26:04,791
Hey. Be careful
of overconfidence, eh?

1158
01:26:07,195 --> 01:26:10,797
Slow it down,
think it through...

1159
01:26:11,232 --> 01:26:14,868
Then you will see
the traps coming.

1160
01:26:54,142 --> 01:26:55,509
Welcome to Russia.

1161
01:26:55,511 --> 01:26:56,977
Thank you.

1162
01:26:58,913 --> 01:27:00,180
Welcome.

1163
01:27:00,182 --> 01:27:02,082
Thank you.

1164
01:28:11,653 --> 01:28:14,021
Now is the time, coach.

1165
01:28:14,023 --> 01:28:17,324
I will return everything
you have done for me.

1166
01:28:17,326 --> 01:28:19,926
For you and mama,
I'm going to win.

1167
01:28:19,928 --> 01:28:22,629
Don't think
about that now, Phiona.

1168
01:28:22,631 --> 01:28:24,931
One step at a time, eh?

1169
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,668
I must win.

1170
01:28:29,804 --> 01:28:30,937
<i>Coming to you live</i>

1171
01:28:30,939 --> 01:28:32,306
<i>from Khanty-Mansiysk,
in Russia</i>

1172
01:28:32,308 --> 01:28:35,676
<i>where we are presenting
our chess Olympiad game.</i>

1173
01:28:35,678 --> 01:28:38,545
<i>This is the last round
where Uganda</i>

1174
01:28:38,547 --> 01:28:40,514
<i>is being paired with Canada</i>

1175
01:28:40,516 --> 01:28:43,250
<i>and we are having
the Uganda young star,</i>

1176
01:28:43,252 --> 01:28:44,651
<i>14-year-old Phiona Mutesi</i>

1177
01:28:44,653 --> 01:28:45,686
<i>who's leading her team.</i>

1178
01:28:45,688 --> 01:28:48,488
<i>Seeing this youngest girl
representing the country</i>

1179
01:28:48,490 --> 01:28:50,090
<i>- for the first time ever.</i>
- Go, Phiona!

1180
01:28:50,092 --> 01:28:51,825
<i>This is history in the making.</i>

1181
01:28:51,827 --> 01:28:53,193
I always believed in that girl.

1182
01:28:53,195 --> 01:28:57,197
<i>Phiona looks a bit nervous,
but she's very bold.</i>

1183
01:29:25,593 --> 01:29:26,493
<i>Tight, tight game.</i>

1184
01:29:26,495 --> 01:29:28,795
<i>But the position
is not very good for her.</i>

1185
01:29:28,797 --> 01:29:31,231
<i>Kagramanov has a bit
advantage for now,</i>

1186
01:29:31,233 --> 01:29:34,334
<i>but Phiona is still
hanging in there.</i>

1187
01:30:58,019 --> 01:31:01,521
<i>Oh, no. Oh, no.
Yeah, she's resigned.</i>

1188
01:31:01,523 --> 01:31:03,657
<i>I think she's giving up
on the game.</i>

1189
01:31:03,659 --> 01:31:07,594
<i>I think this is too much
for a 14-year-old.</i>

1190
01:31:51,205 --> 01:31:54,674
Phiona.
Phiona! Phiona!

1191
01:31:54,676 --> 01:31:57,611
I told you, never
leave the group, eh?

1192
01:31:57,645 --> 01:31:59,479
I will never be a master.

1193
01:31:59,481 --> 01:32:01,915
I will never be good enough.

1194
01:32:01,917 --> 01:32:03,884
And you knew it, coach.

1195
01:32:08,956 --> 01:32:12,759
I sell maize, coach.
I sell maize!

1196
01:32:12,761 --> 01:32:15,061
I know how to do that.

1197
01:32:15,063 --> 01:32:16,129
But now you see me.

1198
01:32:16,131 --> 01:32:18,632
See how chess has disturbed me.

1199
01:32:18,634 --> 01:32:20,200
I will never belong to it!

1200
01:32:20,202 --> 01:32:23,003
And this will never be my place!

1201
01:32:23,005 --> 01:32:24,538
Phiona. Phiona.

1202
01:32:24,540 --> 01:32:28,141
Losing does not mean
you're a failure.

1203
01:32:28,143 --> 01:32:30,477
It just takes time, that's all.

1204
01:32:30,479 --> 01:32:32,913
Stamina. Eh?
That is the key.

1205
01:32:32,915 --> 01:32:36,416
I wish you had never
taught me this game!

1206
01:32:36,418 --> 01:32:38,919
Phiona, Phiona.

1207
01:32:57,138 --> 01:33:00,607
Hey, Phiona!
How is your life?

1208
01:33:12,587 --> 01:33:13,086
Robert Katende.

1209
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:17,324
Mr. Katende, Wilson of east
Africa sewerage on the line.

1210
01:33:17,326 --> 01:33:18,525
Oh, Mr. Wilson.

1211
01:33:18,527 --> 01:33:20,360
<i>Finally, I have a position
for you.</i>

1212
01:33:20,362 --> 01:33:24,197
I can bring you in
as an engineering supervisor.

1213
01:33:24,199 --> 01:33:24,798
Supervisor?

1214
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:26,299
I'm happy to offer you
something that will

1215
01:33:26,301 --> 01:33:29,202
make a big difference
in your life.

1216
01:33:29,804 --> 01:33:31,972
Ho!

1217
01:33:32,540 --> 01:33:34,074
<i>Uh, Mr. Katende...</i>

1218
01:33:34,141 --> 01:33:36,977
Can I expect you Monday?

1219
01:33:37,244 --> 01:33:38,278
Uh...

1220
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:42,115
Thank you. Thank you
for the offer, sir.

1221
01:33:42,117 --> 01:33:43,149
Uh...

1222
01:33:43,151 --> 01:33:47,587
May I have a day to discuss
it with my family?

1223
01:33:55,563 --> 01:33:57,631
Phiona! Don't mind.

1224
01:33:57,633 --> 01:34:00,333
Next time you win
that trophy, eh?

1225
01:34:24,625 --> 01:34:25,992
Coach...

1226
01:34:25,994 --> 01:34:30,964
<i>You told us to make a plan
for when the rains came.</i>

1227
01:34:32,833 --> 01:34:35,402
<i>But how can I plan
when there is no roof...</i>

1228
01:34:35,404 --> 01:34:38,138
I'll return later.
Do you understand?

1229
01:34:38,140 --> 01:34:39,973
Do you understand?
Yes.

1230
01:34:39,975 --> 01:34:41,107
Bye, Richard.

1231
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:43,640
Theo, let's go

1232
01:34:48,282 --> 01:34:50,550
<i>When there are no walls?</i>

1233
01:34:55,523 --> 01:34:59,225
<i>The water does not care
about my plan.</i>

1234
01:35:00,327 --> 01:35:02,729
<i>The water takes
anything it wants.</i>

1235
01:35:02,731 --> 01:35:05,799
Night! Night!

1236
01:35:06,167 --> 01:35:07,233
Night!

1237
01:35:23,785 --> 01:35:26,920
Brian! Brian!

1238
01:35:27,521 --> 01:35:29,189
Help me!

1239
01:35:31,125 --> 01:35:32,592
Help me!

1240
01:35:37,565 --> 01:35:39,399
Richard!
Richard!

1241
01:35:39,401 --> 01:35:40,967
Richard!

1242
01:35:49,944 --> 01:35:52,445
Mama, give me Richard.

1243
01:35:53,247 --> 01:35:54,714
You hold him!

1244
01:35:54,716 --> 01:35:57,317
Night! Night!

1245
01:35:57,319 --> 01:36:01,721
Tell me how I should
have played, coach.

1246
01:36:11,499 --> 01:36:12,732
Night!

1247
01:36:14,235 --> 01:36:15,535
You come with me!

1248
01:36:15,537 --> 01:36:16,903
I was coming back.

1249
01:36:16,905 --> 01:36:18,905
You were supposed
to watch Richard!

1250
01:36:18,907 --> 01:36:19,639
Where were you?

1251
01:36:19,641 --> 01:36:22,175
I left only a few minutes.
He was tied in.

1252
01:36:22,177 --> 01:36:26,045
Do not speak a word!

1253
01:36:29,416 --> 01:36:31,484
Mama! Put down my things!

1254
01:36:31,486 --> 01:36:33,653
Mama! Mama, I'm sorry!

1255
01:36:33,655 --> 01:36:34,587
Why? Why?

1256
01:36:34,589 --> 01:36:37,624
Have I not already
lost one child?

1257
01:36:38,627 --> 01:36:40,260
Mama, I'm sorry!

1258
01:36:40,262 --> 01:36:42,095
Don't, mama! Don't!

1259
01:36:44,565 --> 01:36:46,099
Mama, I'm pregnant.

1260
01:36:48,435 --> 01:36:49,702
What?

1261
01:36:51,205 --> 01:36:52,872
Hey...

1262
01:37:01,882 --> 01:37:07,053
<i>Very soon, men will
start coming after me.</i>

1263
01:37:08,956 --> 01:37:11,925
Where is my safe square, coach?

1264
01:37:14,428 --> 01:37:16,029
You are finding it.

1265
01:37:16,031 --> 01:37:20,266
You do not have to travel
down the same path as night.

1266
01:37:20,268 --> 01:37:23,102
You have a chance
to make your own.

1267
01:37:23,971 --> 01:37:25,138
And you are strong.

1268
01:37:25,140 --> 01:37:29,142
I fear certain things
will never change.

1269
01:37:29,144 --> 01:37:30,944
You are the youngest ever player

1270
01:37:30,946 --> 01:37:33,980
to take Uganda
to the chess Olympiad.

1271
01:37:34,915 --> 01:37:36,449
Things are changing.

1272
01:37:37,151 --> 01:37:39,519
My life is the same.

1273
01:37:39,521 --> 01:37:40,787
Phiona.

1274
01:37:49,563 --> 01:37:54,267
My mother had me when she was
still in high school.

1275
01:37:54,635 --> 01:37:56,970
She couldn't even present me
to my father

1276
01:37:56,972 --> 01:37:59,372
because he had another family

1277
01:37:59,374 --> 01:38:02,242
so I was moved
from aunty to aunty.

1278
01:38:02,244 --> 01:38:05,778
The first time I met my mother,

1279
01:38:05,780 --> 01:38:08,181
<i>I was six years old.</i>

1280
01:38:08,249 --> 01:38:11,351
<i>And I could hardly believe
she was the one.</i>

1281
01:38:11,353 --> 01:38:13,820
I had always been
called Katende.

1282
01:38:13,822 --> 01:38:16,623
She was the one who told me
my name was Robert.

1283
01:38:16,625 --> 01:38:20,860
Robert Katende, I'm your mother.

1284
01:38:20,995 --> 01:38:24,797
<i>I stayed with her for two years.</i>

1285
01:38:25,032 --> 01:38:29,702
<i>And she became my everything.</i>

1286
01:38:33,540 --> 01:38:36,676
Then, this one Saturday...

1287
01:38:36,678 --> 01:38:41,547
<i>My grandmother came
crying mother's name.</i>

1288
01:38:41,682 --> 01:38:45,118
And I knew, in that moment,
that...

1289
01:38:45,786 --> 01:38:47,987
Mama had died.

1290
01:38:53,227 --> 01:38:56,562
I lost her for a second time.

1291
01:38:57,564 --> 01:39:01,401
I, too, thought things
could never change.

1292
01:39:03,004 --> 01:39:05,038
But they did.

1293
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:07,407
Losses happen for all of us.

1294
01:39:07,409 --> 01:39:11,744
But what matters is
when you reset the pieces

1295
01:39:11,746 --> 01:39:14,380
and play again.

1296
01:39:15,683 --> 01:39:16,816
Huh?

1297
01:39:16,818 --> 01:39:20,286
The Rwabushenyi championship
is waiting for you.

1298
01:39:20,288 --> 01:39:22,956
One day, you'll be ready for it.

1299
01:39:22,958 --> 01:39:25,758
And then your life could change.

1300
01:39:30,464 --> 01:39:34,067
I don't want to go back
to my mother's place.

1301
01:39:37,171 --> 01:39:39,839
I want to stay here...

1302
01:39:40,007 --> 01:39:44,010
Study and work on my chess.

1303
01:39:44,144 --> 01:39:47,080
Can I stay for some time?

1304
01:39:50,317 --> 01:39:51,584
Yes.

1305
01:39:57,558 --> 01:39:59,359
Yes, you can.

1306
01:40:00,928 --> 01:40:04,230
I will speak to your mother.

1307
01:40:07,369 --> 01:40:09,102
Is Phiona all right?

1308
01:40:09,770 --> 01:40:12,939
She will be staying
with us for a while.

1309
01:40:16,010 --> 01:40:18,044
What is it, Robert?

1310
01:40:19,713 --> 01:40:22,415
I must let you know something.

1311
01:40:23,183 --> 01:40:27,820
Mr. Wilson, from east Africa
sewerage called.

1312
01:40:27,955 --> 01:40:34,394
He finally offered me a job
as an engineering supervisor.

1313
01:40:35,029 --> 01:40:36,262
Good pay.

1314
01:40:36,264 --> 01:40:40,666
Much higher than what we now
receive from the ministry.

1315
01:40:43,771 --> 01:40:45,438
I refused him.

1316
01:40:46,306 --> 01:40:48,674
I cannot leave the pioneers.

1317
01:40:49,744 --> 01:40:52,945
This may make our lives
more complicated.

1318
01:40:52,947 --> 01:40:54,013
Sorry for that.

1319
01:40:54,015 --> 01:40:56,015
Why do you do this?

1320
01:40:58,752 --> 01:41:03,256
Why are you sorry for doing
what you know is right?

1321
01:41:03,424 --> 01:41:04,857
I always knew you were
the kind of person

1322
01:41:04,859 --> 01:41:09,095
who would give everything to
a purpose like the pioneers.

1323
01:41:10,364 --> 01:41:12,665
That is your work.

1324
01:41:12,733 --> 01:41:16,769
And that is the work
of this family.

1325
01:41:44,264 --> 01:41:48,835
Who can name all the countries
in our dearly beloved Africa?

1326
01:41:48,837 --> 01:41:51,804
Me, teacher!
Me, teacher!

1327
01:41:54,875 --> 01:41:56,843
How about you, Phiona?

1328
01:41:57,511 --> 01:41:58,878
Do you know one?

1329
01:42:00,781 --> 01:42:01,447
Sudan?

1330
01:42:01,449 --> 01:42:03,382
Excellent.
That's right.

1331
01:42:03,384 --> 01:42:06,052
Now please open your books
and write down for me

1332
01:42:06,054 --> 01:42:09,522
the names of three
African countries.

1333
01:42:13,300 --> 01:42:14,330
Welcome home, son

1334
01:42:14,332 --> 01:42:15,633
Did you speak to Phiona?
When is she coming home?

1335
01:42:15,635 --> 01:42:16,635
I am here

1336
01:42:17,699 --> 01:42:19,265
She wishes to stay a bit longer

1337
01:42:19,267 --> 01:42:21,334
with coach and his family.

1338
01:42:46,093 --> 01:42:47,393
Hey!

1339
01:42:48,529 --> 01:42:49,762
Mmm-hmm.

1340
01:42:54,801 --> 01:42:55,735
Checkmate.

1341
01:42:55,737 --> 01:42:57,904
What?
Madam Phiona.

1342
01:42:57,906 --> 01:42:58,871
Yes?

1343
01:42:58,873 --> 01:43:00,206
Are you a champion?

1344
01:43:00,208 --> 01:43:01,774
No, not yet.

1345
01:43:01,776 --> 01:43:04,644
Will you try at Rwabushenyi?

1346
01:43:04,646 --> 01:43:07,346
I don't think so.
Maybe next year.

1347
01:43:07,348 --> 01:43:10,183
No, you must try this year!

1348
01:43:10,185 --> 01:43:12,985
Phiona, do it for us.

1349
01:43:16,356 --> 01:43:18,791
Checkmate!

1350
01:43:19,326 --> 01:43:22,795
You must consider the
other side of your board.

1351
01:43:24,232 --> 01:43:25,898
Nowadays you beat me so easily!

1352
01:43:25,900 --> 01:43:28,935
Me, I think strategy must
run in your blood, eh?

1353
01:43:28,937 --> 01:43:32,538
Did one of your ancestors
command a great army?

1354
01:43:32,540 --> 01:43:34,907
These pieces are my army.

1355
01:43:34,909 --> 01:43:36,876
You must play at Rwabushenyi.
Mmm.

1356
01:43:36,878 --> 01:43:39,212
It is the premier tournament
in the country.

1357
01:43:39,214 --> 01:43:42,114
You would be playing
international masters.

1358
01:43:42,116 --> 01:43:43,816
Or do you fear losing?

1359
01:43:45,119 --> 01:43:49,922
Losing teaches me
how to play better.

1360
01:43:50,023 --> 01:43:51,557
I will play.

1361
01:43:51,559 --> 01:43:55,962
I can see your mother's
strength in you, Phiona.

1362
01:43:56,029 --> 01:43:57,863
How is she?

1363
01:44:00,267 --> 01:44:06,038
If I could see my mother
for just one more time...

1364
01:44:06,340 --> 01:44:10,643
I would give everything
in my possession for that.

1365
01:44:18,585 --> 01:44:20,253
No customers today.

1366
01:44:20,255 --> 01:44:22,321
Ah, it's still early.

1367
01:44:22,323 --> 01:44:23,589
They will come.

1368
01:44:41,108 --> 01:44:42,308
Mom...

1369
01:44:49,449 --> 01:44:50,683
Are you my daughter?

1370
01:44:50,685 --> 01:44:52,485
Yes, mom. I am.

1371
01:44:58,225 --> 01:45:00,259
Here, come. Sit, sit.

1372
01:45:03,497 --> 01:45:04,764
You are smart.

1373
01:45:04,766 --> 01:45:07,199
Thank you, mom.
Now I'm in school.

1374
01:45:07,201 --> 01:45:10,269
I know. I know.

1375
01:45:12,039 --> 01:45:14,373
Look, Richard.
Phiona has come back.

1376
01:45:14,375 --> 01:45:15,775
Put it here.

1377
01:45:18,178 --> 01:45:19,011
Mom.
Huh?

1378
01:45:19,013 --> 01:45:21,514
Coach is there.
Where?

1379
01:45:28,422 --> 01:45:29,722
Thank you.

1380
01:45:44,338 --> 01:45:45,638
Hello, madam.

1381
01:45:47,541 --> 01:45:51,010
You give this to your wife
from my family.

1382
01:45:51,012 --> 01:45:54,847
Please, please, no need
for that. Thank you.

1383
01:45:54,849 --> 01:45:57,616
You have done something
remarkable.

1384
01:45:57,618 --> 01:45:59,618
You are speaking no sense again.

1385
01:45:59,620 --> 01:46:01,020
Your children are blessed

1386
01:46:01,022 --> 01:46:04,990
because they have a mother
who never gave up on them.

1387
01:46:06,093 --> 01:46:07,159
And you did it all alone.

1388
01:46:14,267 --> 01:46:16,902
I have tried for them.

1389
01:46:17,070 --> 01:46:18,471
Yeah.

1390
01:46:18,473 --> 01:46:20,573
Thank you.

1391
01:46:32,285 --> 01:46:33,619
Buy some.

1392
01:46:37,592 --> 01:46:38,891
Sir...
Even me!

1393
01:46:38,893 --> 01:46:40,793
Spice!
Mama!

1394
01:46:42,863 --> 01:46:44,530
Please, sir.
You're my spice.

1395
01:46:44,532 --> 01:46:45,532
Yeah!

1396
01:46:52,939 --> 01:46:54,306
Oh, Zesiro.

1397
01:46:54,308 --> 01:46:57,276
Phiona has to win
that championship.

1398
01:46:57,278 --> 01:46:57,743
But no problem.

1399
01:46:57,745 --> 01:46:59,812
If not, your daughter
will sell with my daughter.

1400
01:46:59,814 --> 01:47:04,417
No. My daughter will not be
selling in the market.

1401
01:48:10,073 --> 01:48:11,533
Thank you, coach

1402
01:48:21,094 --> 01:48:22,761
This is the final round

1403
01:48:22,763 --> 01:48:26,198
of our Rwabushenyi national
chess championship.

1404
01:48:26,200 --> 01:48:28,901
Phiona Mutesi
and Christine Namaganda

1405
01:48:28,903 --> 01:48:31,704
are tied for first position
in the women's category.

1406
01:48:31,706 --> 01:48:35,941
They will now play
the final deciding game.

1407
01:48:39,479 --> 01:48:41,747
Commence play, please.

1408
01:49:59,759 --> 01:50:02,995
You belong here!

1409
01:50:04,764 --> 01:50:08,300
You belong here.
Silence.

1410
01:50:09,402 --> 01:50:11,003
Or move out.

1411
01:50:11,037 --> 01:50:13,072
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1412
01:51:18,505 --> 01:51:20,305
Yes! Yes!

1413
01:51:20,307 --> 01:51:21,740
What does it mean?

1414
01:51:21,742 --> 01:51:23,008
What does it mean?

1415
01:51:23,010 --> 01:51:24,743
It means she's winning!

1416
01:51:25,378 --> 01:51:27,479
She's winning.

1417
01:52:20,500 --> 01:52:22,468
She queened the pawn!

1418
01:52:22,470 --> 01:52:25,771
- She queened the pawn!
- Yes, yes, yes!

1419
01:52:45,592 --> 01:52:46,959
Phiona.

1420
01:52:59,506 --> 01:53:02,674
Phiona! Phiona! Phiona!

1421
01:53:02,676 --> 01:53:06,345
Katwe! Katwe! Katwe!

1422
01:53:39,212 --> 01:53:41,246
Hold it up! Hold it up!

1423
01:53:45,351 --> 01:53:48,554
Katwe! Katwe! Katwe!

1424
01:53:48,556 --> 01:53:50,889
Madam! Madam!

1425
01:53:50,891 --> 01:53:52,691
Come!
Eh!

1426
01:53:52,959 --> 01:53:54,459
Mama!

1427
01:54:09,609 --> 01:54:11,109
Well done, madam.

1428
01:54:11,685 --> 01:54:12,725
All is happiness

1429
01:54:40,206 --> 01:54:41,974
Eh!

1430
01:54:47,380 --> 01:54:50,215
- Is this, uh, that Phiona?
- Mmm-hmm!

1431
01:54:50,217 --> 01:54:52,651
They made a book
on her life story.

1432
01:54:52,653 --> 01:54:54,386
Was she paid for this?

1433
01:54:54,388 --> 01:54:55,621
Yes, she was.

1434
01:54:55,623 --> 01:54:57,356
Hmm!

1435
01:55:06,066 --> 01:55:09,868
No! You play over there.

1436
01:55:11,104 --> 01:55:13,305
- Brian!
- Mama! Mama, come!

1437
01:55:13,307 --> 01:55:15,140
Come!

1438
01:55:15,142 --> 01:55:17,876
Just come, mama. Just come!

1439
01:55:17,878 --> 01:55:18,844
Wait, my sweater.

1440
01:55:18,846 --> 01:55:20,512
You don't need, mama.
Mom.

1441
01:55:20,514 --> 01:55:21,213
Let's go.

1442
01:55:21,215 --> 01:55:24,483
- Where are we going?
- Just come!

1443
01:55:24,884 --> 01:55:26,551
Where are you taking me?

1444
01:55:26,553 --> 01:55:28,854
Mom, just enter. Just enter.

1445
01:55:37,664 --> 01:55:41,233
Where are you taking me
in this motorcar?

1446
01:55:41,235 --> 01:55:42,901
Wait!

1447
01:56:23,609 --> 01:56:26,578
I can see that red thing
for mummy.

1448
01:56:26,580 --> 01:56:29,014
See that red shirt.

1449
01:56:29,016 --> 01:56:30,515
Red shirt.

1450
01:56:37,857 --> 01:56:39,224
Where are we?

1451
01:56:43,296 --> 01:56:45,364
We are home, mama.

1452
01:59:19,319 --> 01:59:20,952
Ah!

1453
01:59:22,522 --> 01:59:23,522
Ah!

1454
02:00:01,895 --> 02:00:04,196
Beautiful. Beautiful.
