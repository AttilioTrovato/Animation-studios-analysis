1
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,870
Has it come on?

2
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,120
No.

3
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,040
Now?

4
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,460
No.

5
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:01,960
Now?

6
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,210
No.

7
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,870
Now?

8
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:10,040
Turn the damn thing properly!

9
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,910
<i>Welcome to the wrestling area</i>
<i>at the Seoul Olympics.</i>

10
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,960
<i>Looking forward to</i>
<i>an exciting match today.</i>

11
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,000
It's come on.

12
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,500
Shall I come down?

13
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,660
No.

14
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,370
Stand there holding it.

15
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,160
<i>The final match this Olympics...</i>
<i>in the 72 kilo category,</i>

16
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:32,960
<i>between wrestlers from</i>
<i>Russia and America.</i>

17
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,370
<i>It's really sad that,</i>

18
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,580
<i>despite wrestling being</i>
<i>such a popular sport in India</i>

19
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:43,000
<i>Indian wrestlers have</i>
<i>disappointed in the Olympics.</i>

20
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:45,960
Even our boys
can bring home medals.

21
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,500
But where is the support?

22
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,370
Neither money,
nor facilities.

23
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,710
How will our boys win a medal?

24
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,710
If a medal could be won with words,

25
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:03,250
you would have won
it a long time ago.

26
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:08,790
Are you new here?

27
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,910
That's what I thought.

28
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:18,000
Try stepping into a
wrestling arena someday,

29
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:21,080
you'll run for your life
before the match begins.

30
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:25,330
Looks like you have
done it many times.

31
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:28,580
Run for your life.

32
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:33,040
If this were an arena,
then we'd see who would run.

33
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,620
Why do we need an arena?

34
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:41,250
<i>Now, the moment</i>
<i>we were all waiting for.</i>

35
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,750
<i>The stage is all set for a big fight.</i>

36
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,830
<i>There's palpable</i>
<i>excitement in the air.</i>

37
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,910
<i>Both the wrestlers are walking,</i>

38
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,540
<i>for the fight.</i>

39
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,870
<i>You are absolutely right, Tom.</i>

40
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,370
<i>Looks like it's going</i>
<i>to be an interesting bout. </i>

41
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:59,250
<i>The crowd seems excited.</i>

42
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,330
<i>The wrestlers come face to face.</i>

43
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:09,870
<i>Let's see how it plays out.</i>

44
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,960
<i>The customary handshake.</i>

45
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,500
<i>The referee's whistle...</i>
<i>and the match begins!</i>

46
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,750
<i>He's down!</i>

47
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,040
<i>He's down!</i>

48
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,290
<i>An early thrashing</i>
<i>for the Russian wrestler.</i>

49
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,080
<i>Overconfidence can often</i>
<i>prove fatal.</i>

50
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:37,210
Bro, you want to try once more?

51
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,790
<i>Now, the wrestlers are gearing up</i>
<i>for the next round.</i>

52
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:55,120
<i>Yes, Tom, this match doesn't look</i>
<i>as easy as it had seemed.</i>

53
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:57,830
<i>Let's see what happens now.</i>

54
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,750
<i>Both wrestlers testing each other.</i>

55
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:04,410
<i>A great attack!</i>
<i>An equally superb defense.</i>

56
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,580
<i>And that was a magnificent move!</i>

57
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,620
<i>What an amazing move!</i>

58
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:15,210
<i>He didn't know what hit him.</i>

59
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,290
<i>Here's an attack.</i>

60
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,790
<i>And that's a counter-attack!</i>

61
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,160
<i>And it's over!</i>

62
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:25,790
<i>It's all over.</i>

63
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,120
<i>David has become Goliath,</i>

64
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:30,500
<i>and Goliath has become David here.</i>

65
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,960
<i>Well said, Tom.</i>

66
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,500
<i>No one expected such a quick defeat</i>
<i>for the Russian wrestler.</i>

67
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,500
<i>What a match!</i>

68
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:39,750
<i>This is top class wrestling.</i>

69
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:43,910
You are good.

70
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,080
You've just defeated
a state level champion.

71
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,620
Don't be disheartened buddy,

72
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:53,040
you've just lost to
a national level champion.

73
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,540
<i>Meet my uncle. </i>

74
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,870
<i>Mahavir Singh Phogat. </i>

75
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,910
<i>He quit wrestling many years ago,</i>

76
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,790
<i>but wrestling hasn't</i>
<i>quit on him.</i>

77
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:27,250
<i>"I am here to stay"</i>

78
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:30,120
<i>"Beat the best"</i>

79
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,710
<i>"I am here to stay"</i>

80
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,370
<i>"Beat the best"</i>

81
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,460
<i>"From the mother's womb to the</i>
<i>Cemetery, your life is a wrestling bout"</i>

82
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,710
<i>"So, wrestle, O Wrestler!"</i>

83
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,410
<i>"Wrestle, O Wrestler!"</i>

84
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:49,160
<i>"Your glory may rise and fall"</i>

85
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,160
<i>"Cause up in the sky</i>
<i>Your stars are wrestling, too"</i>

86
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,250
<i>"So, wrestle, O Wrestler!"</i>

87
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,410
<i>"Wrestle, O Wrestler!"</i>

88
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:03,500
<i>"When your heart thumps with fear"</i>

89
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:04,960
<i>"Pat your back"</i>

90
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,290
<i>"Bring back courage"</i>

91
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:08,750
<i>"And you'll be fine"</i>

92
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,290
<i>"Every challenge is like a crazed</i>
<i>Elephant"</i>

93
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:15,620
<i>"Standing in front of you"</i>

94
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,210
<i>"Staring fierce"</i>

95
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:18,870
<i>"Threatening you"</i>

96
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,960
<i>"So, take it head on"</i>

97
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,660
<i>"That's what you are born for!"</i>

98
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,160
<i>"So, wrestle, O Wrestler!"</i>

99
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:29,460
<i>"Wrestle, O Wrestler!"</i>

100
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,750
<i>"Your glory may rise and fall"</i>

101
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:35,370
<i>"Cause up in the sky</i>
<i>Your stars are wrestling, too"</i>

102
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,210
<i>"So, wrestle, O Wrestler!"</i>

103
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,500
<i>"Wrestle, O Wrestler!"</i>

104
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,290
<i>"Wrestle, O Wrestler!"</i>

105
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:44,790
<i>"Wrestle, O Wrestler!"</i>

106
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,540
<i>"Wrestle, O Wrestler!"</i>

107
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,250
<i>"Wrestle, O Wrestler!"</i>

108
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,000
<i>"Wrestle, O Wrestler!"</i>

109
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:55,790
<i>"Wrestle, O Wrestler!"</i>

110
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,460
The smaller kid will win.

111
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,080
There you go!

112
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:06,540
Merely building a good body
does not make a wrestler.

113
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,120
Come here, kid.

114
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:13,120
Wrestling runs in the blood,
you have to be born with it.

115
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:16,040
Here. Buy yourself some milk.

116
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,040
Bless you.

117
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:57,750
When there's no food on your plate
what will you eat? Medals?

118
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,750
No one gives a damn
about wrestling.

119
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,580
Just take up the job
you are being offered.

120
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,870
Why did you quit wrestling?

121
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,790
I had no choice.

122
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,460
Wrestling gave me respect, fame,

123
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,370
but it couldn't give me money.

124
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,250
So, I took up this job.

125
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:32,000
<i>Every wrestler dreams,</i>

126
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,410
<i>of bringing honor and</i>
<i>glory to the country.</i>

127
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,210
<i>But if the country offers no support,</i>

128
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:41,910
<i>how far can a wrestler go?</i>

129
00:09:55,210 --> 00:10:00,750
It's not your fault that you
couldn't win a medal for your country.

130
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:05,500
How long will you let these
memories depress you?

131
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:15,960
What I couldn't do,
our son will.

132
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,080
He will win gold
for our country.

133
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,870
Our flag will fly the highest.

134
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,250
Mark my words.

135
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:37,460
<i>That day uncle was</i>
<i>as anxious as a student,</i>

136
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:40,000
<i>whose high school results</i>
<i>were due.</i>

137
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,160
Don't worry, brother.

138
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,370
It's going to be all right.

139
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,870
It's a girl.

140
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,580
<i>Uncle was hoping for a boy.</i>

141
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,290
<i>But a girl was born.</i>

142
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,500
It's ok.

143
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,000
You have a sister now, Omkar.

144
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,460
<i>I was genuinely happy.</i>

145
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,410
<i>But uncle was faking it.</i>

146
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,910
<i>And then it all started.</i>

147
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:26,250
<i>Suddenly everyone in the village</i>
<i>was an expert,</i>

148
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:30,540
<i>in the art of conceiving a boy.</i>

149
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:34,540
Feed a black cow sweets made
with white sesame seeds,

150
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,540
wrapped in maize flatbreads,
with your left hand, before sunrise.

151
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,910
A son, for sure!

152
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,370
Mahavir, here's a special prayer...
for a son.

153
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,330
Recite it daily.

154
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,910
Here... eat this.

155
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:50,750
Eat this!

156
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:52,540
Stop, will you.

157
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,120
Mahavir,

158
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:58,790
make sure you try only on a Sunday.

159
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:03,330
On all other days,
reign in your urges.

160
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,250
Got it?

161
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,120
<i>Neither did people stop</i>
<i>giving their advice,</i>

162
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:10,660
Here you go, son.

163
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:13,040
<i>nor did uncle and aunt</i>
<i>stop acting on them.</i>

164
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:17,370
<i>The day of the delivery arrived</i>
<i>and so did half the village. </i>

165
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,540
<i>To take credit for a son.</i>

166
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,750
Geeta, you are going to
have a brother.

167
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:23,080
You can play with him.

168
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,500
It's a girl.

169
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:37,410
<i>But neither did uncle get a son,</i>

170
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,040
<i>nor the villagers, credit.</i>

171
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,960
<i>But, in all these</i>
<i>"unfailing techniques",</i>

172
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,040
<i>where did the fault lie?</i>

173
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,870
She must have fed a black buffalo
instead of a black cow.

174
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,540
Else, look at my cousin
from Rohtak.

175
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,500
She had three healthy boys
in three years.

176
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:57,000
If you say the prayer in reverse,

177
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,960
the results will also be reversed.

178
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,410
Self-control is a virtue.

179
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,540
I told him to try only on Sundays.

180
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,330
He must have let
the reins free every day.

181
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,750
I couldn't give you a son...

182
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,580
It's not your fault.

183
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,870
And don't get me wrong.

184
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:30,870
Both, Geeta and Babita
are very dear to me.

185
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:39,000
But only a boy
can fulfill my dream.

186
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,500
<i>Years went by. </i>

187
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,870
<i>Uncle remained adamant,</i>

188
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,660
<i>he wanted a boy.</i>

189
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,660
<i>But maybe God was adamant too.</i>

190
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:10,040
<i>The third child was a girl,</i>

191
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:12,790
<i>and so was the fourth.</i>

192
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:25,960
<i>This time I too was dejected.</i>

193
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,330
Dinner is ready, papa.

194
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,960
Dinner.

195
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:02,330
Turn it over or it'll burn.

196
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,410
Another helping, papa?

197
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:20,080
<i>After that uncle gave up on his</i>
<i>desire for a son, and on his dream too.</i>

198
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,580
Hey, Mahavir Singhji!

199
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:27,370
What's wrong with him?

200
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:33,500
Are you coming to watch
the wrestling match this evening?

201
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,210
No. You carry on.

202
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:41,870
Hey, Mahavir!

203
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,330
I've been blessed with a boy.

204
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,210
Here... have some sweets.

205
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,040
What happened?

206
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:38,460
Look how badly
they've been thrashed.

207
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:39,710
Say something!

208
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,040
Yes, look how badly
they've been thrashed.

209
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,790
They're all swollen and bruised.

210
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,370
Yes, they're all swollen and bruised.

211
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,620
Why did you beat them?

212
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,250
I didn't, uncle.

213
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,870
Geeta and Babita beat them up.

214
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:07,660
They started it.

215
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,500
He called me a loser
and Babita a witch.

216
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,370
So, we gave it to them.

217
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,830
They beat them so badly?
For such a trivial reason?

218
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,620
Yes, shouldn't have
beaten them so badly.

219
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:23,460
Please forgive them...
they're kids.

220
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:28,250
We are letting go because
they are your girls.

221
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,160
Move!

222
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,080
Got thrashed by girls!

223
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:38,370
Come here.

224
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:41,710
Come here!

225
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,460
We won't fight again, papa.

226
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,120
First tell me, how did you
manage to do it?

227
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,210
First, he called me a loser
but I remained quiet.

228
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:01,290
But then he called Babita a witch. That
was it.

229
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:04,040
I grabbed him and
punched him like this.

230
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,080
Then the other guy attacked.

231
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:09,750
I caught his hair
and shoved him down,

232
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:12,080
and dug my elbow in his back.

233
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:34,960
<i>They say that a twig is enough</i>
<i>to give hope to a drowning man.</i>

234
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:38,370
<i>Here, uncle had found</i>
<i>not one, but two lifeguards!</i>

235
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:53,160
All along, I was desperate for a son,

236
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,290
so he could win a gold
for the country.

237
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:02,960
But what didn't occur to me
is that gold is gold.

238
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,870
Whether a boy wins it, or a girl.

239
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,500
From now on, Geeta and Babita
will do no household chores.

240
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,830
Wrestling is in their blood.

241
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,710
From now on they will only wrestle.

242
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,250
Wrestling is for boys.

243
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,540
You think our girls are
any lesser than boys?

244
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:29,580
I've never ever seen girls wrestle.

245
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:33,910
What will the villagers say?

246
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,160
For how long will they talk?

247
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:42,370
What if the girls break
their hands and legs?

248
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:44,910
We'll fix them.

249
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,410
Where will the money come from?

250
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:51,620
I don't know.

251
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:59,370
Don't ruin the girls' lives
for your passion.

252
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,500
Let me try for a year.

253
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,750
For this one year,
you bury your feelings.

254
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,460
If I am proven wrong,

255
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:18,910
I'll bury my dream forever.

256
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,210
Be ready at 5 a.m. tomorrow.

257
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,410
Why, papa?

258
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,160
I want to feed you
your favorite snack, gol gappas.

259
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,710
5 a.m. Ok?

260
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:54,540
What did you do now?

261
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,830
I thought you did something.

262
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,120
Eat.

263
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,000
How is it?

264
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:11,330
It's a little less spicy, papa.

265
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:13,620
All right, make it spicier.

266
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,000
Eat as much as you want right now.

267
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:25,410
Because from today, you will both
lead the life of a wrestler.

268
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:34,000
And wrestlers are not allowed,

269
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,500
pickled, oily and spicy food,

270
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,540
in fact,
all the food that you most love.

271
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:45,910
Consider this your last treat.

272
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:59,080
<i>"A messiah for the rest"</i>

273
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,330
<i>"A terror for your own"</i>

274
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:03,250
Come on, faster Babita!

275
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:09,790
<i>"O Papa, don't put us</i>
<i>Through this torture!"</i>

276
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:15,330
<i>"A messiah for the rest</i>
<i>A terror for your own"</i>

277
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:17,750
Papa, it's difficult to run
in these clothes.

278
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:22,750
<i>"O Papa, don't put us</i>
<i>Through this torture!"</i>

279
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:28,080
<i>"Don't torture us!"</i>

280
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:34,540
<i>"O Papa!"</i>

281
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:38,830
<i>"O Papa!"</i>

282
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:50,120
<i>"O Papa, you are..."</i>

283
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,580
Don't you dare stop!

284
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:56,250
<i>"O Papa, you are</i>
<i>Injurious to our health"</i>

285
00:22:56,330 --> 00:23:01,210
<i>"O Papa, you are</i>
<i>Injurious to our health"</i>

286
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,370
<i>"Have mercy on us"</i>

287
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:06,210
<i>"We are little children"</i>

288
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:08,210
<i>"Have mercy on us"</i>

289
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:10,000
<i>"We are little children"</i>

290
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,080
<i>"So much discipline..."</i>

291
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:19,120
<i>"So much discipline</i>
<i>Makes us want to die"</i>

292
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:24,210
<i>"O Papa, you are</i>
<i>Injurious to our health"</i>

293
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:26,290
<i>"Have mercy on us"</i>

294
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:28,500
<i>"We are little children"</i>

295
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,960
<i>"Have mercy on us"</i>

296
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,460
<i>"We are little children"</i>

297
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:36,160
<i>"So much discipline..."</i>

298
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:41,830
<i>"So much discipline</i>
<i>Makes us want to die"</i>

299
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:46,790
<i>"O Papa, you are</i>
<i>Injurious to our health"</i>

300
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,660
Nobody would've ever been
punished so severely,

301
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:52,870
for beating up a couple of boys.

302
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:59,460
He abused me.
Why did you have to beat him?

303
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,080
Now you tell me!

304
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:09,370
<i>"You stopped our</i>
<i>Picnics and outings"</i>

305
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,370
<i>"This is torture"</i>

306
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:14,290
<i>"Grave torture!"</i>

307
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:18,410
<i>"To tell children, not to</i>
<i>Enjoy their childhood"</i>

308
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,620
<i>"This is torture"</i>

309
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:23,000
<i>"Grave torture!"</i>

310
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:30,660
<i>"Toffees, games and toys"</i>

311
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,960
<i>"Scrumptious foods"</i>

312
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,120
<i>"Have bid us adieu"</i>

313
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:37,460
<i>"Since your scolding"</i>

314
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:41,790
<i>"This is our time</i>
<i>For fun and games"</i>

315
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:46,540
<i>"Why is it being measured</i>
<i>By a stopwatch?"</i>

316
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:50,620
<i>"Our luck is like a broken down car"</i>

317
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:55,000
<i>"Our luck is like a broken down car"</i>

318
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:58,370
<i>"And our papa..."</i>

319
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:04,250
<i>"And our papa is the</i>
<i>Driver of that car"</i>

320
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:09,500
<i>"O Papa, you are</i>
<i>Injurious to our health"</i>

321
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:13,410
<i>"You have forbidden us</i>
<i>Tasty and spicy food"</i>

322
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,830
<i>"This is torture"</i>

323
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:18,250
<i>"Grave torture!"</i>

324
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:22,500
<i>"You ask delicate dolls</i>
<i>To toughen up"</i>

325
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:25,210
<i>"This is torture"</i>

326
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:27,330
<i>"Grave torture!"</i>

327
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:31,370
We'll obey your
every command, mummy.

328
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,330
Just save us
from this wrestling.

329
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,410
For one year forget
that you have a mother.

330
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,120
Hey! Forgot so quickly?

331
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,500
How utterly absurd, Mahavir!

332
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,210
Girls in the wrestling arena?

333
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:47,370
Will you have me sin at this age?

334
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:52,910
<i>"Our childhood has been</i>
<i>Thrown away"</i>

335
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,160
<i>"The garden has lost its blossoms"</i>

336
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:59,580
<i>"Wonder what kind of</i>
<i>War we prepare for?"</i>

337
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:04,210
<i>"Day and night, we cry</i>
<i>Cascades of tears"</i>

338
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:09,000
<i>"You are still not happy,</i>
<i>O dictator, we are your sacrifice"</i>

339
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:13,330
<i>"Do you think we are so hopeless?"</i>

340
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:17,210
<i>"Do you think we are so hopeless?"</i>

341
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:21,660
<i>"Better than you, are..."</i>

342
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:26,160
<i>"Better than you, are</i>
<i>Bollywood movie villains"</i>

343
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:31,580
<i>"O Papa, you are</i>
<i>Injurious to our health"</i>

344
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,370
Babita...

345
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:40,540
Will you press my legs please?

346
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,580
I was going to ask you
the same thing.

347
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,960
Always respect Mother Earth.

348
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:28,830
The more you respect it,

349
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,250
the more respect
you will get in return.

350
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:01,660
<i>Uncle had managed to bring</i>
<i>Geeta and Babita to the wrestling pit,</i>

351
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,790
<i>but there was something missing.</i>

352
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,040
<i>In order for Geeta and</i>
<i>Babita to train well,</i>

353
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,660
<i>they needed to practice</i>
<i>with good wrestlers.</i>

354
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,710
Omkar?

355
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:16,580
Him?

356
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:18,580
Yes.

357
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,620
Isn't that too much, brother?

358
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:23,910
It was bad enough that
you were making the girls wrestle.

359
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,410
Now you want
them to fight boys?

360
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,870
Yes or no?

361
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:34,790
I don't have the heart to say yes.

362
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:37,500
And, I don't have the courage
to say no.

363
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,790
Ok, then send him over.

364
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:50,500
Because of you both
I am caught in the crossfire.

365
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:52,410
Stop complaining!

366
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:54,540
You are just caught
in the crossfire.

367
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:57,080
We've been pushed into war.

368
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:58,370
Keep running!

369
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,580
Why has papa got him
to train with us?

370
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,830
This pint-sized boy is no challenge.

371
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,250
He looks like a 'TTSS' to me.

372
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:07,410
What does that mean?

373
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,500
Tall on Talk, Short on Strength.

374
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:15,210
'TTSS'... is it?

375
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,750
Go easy, I am your little sister.

376
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:35,790
Yes... yes!

377
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,080
Don't mind me saying,

378
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,710
but your girls are a little weak.

379
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,750
Want to fight me?

380
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:52,830
I'll be right back.

381
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,330
I don't understand your ways.

382
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:55,080
At one time,

383
00:30:55,160 --> 00:31:01,290
I can either be
their coach or their father.

384
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,120
When the coach is at work,

385
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,540
the father has to take a back seat.

386
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:19,370
Sorry for calling you 'TTSS.'

387
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,000
Sorry, my foot!

388
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,120
You think this is a joke?

389
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,870
He is throwing you down
and you are letting him?

390
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:32,830
When he attacks from the left,

391
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:35,710
why don't you stabilize yourself
on the left and defend?

392
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:37,250
Sorry, papa.

393
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,370
Child, this is wrestling,

394
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:42,080
three sorrys and the game is over.

395
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:44,040
Come on.

396
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:45,580
Try again.

397
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:55,790
Where's the strength in you?

398
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:01,660
You are training the girls to wrestle,

399
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,410
I didn't say anything.

400
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:05,870
But I will not allow you to cook
chicken in my kitchen!

401
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,210
Try and understand.

402
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,410
Wrestlers require protein.

403
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:10,790
I don't care!

404
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:13,000
If meat is cooked in my kitchen,

405
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,370
I will stop eating.

406
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,580
You want your girls
to be weak wrestlers?

407
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,040
I don't know anything.

408
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:20,830
There's no way chicken will be
cooked in my kitchen!

409
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:25,910
-Omkar!
-Yes.

410
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,370
-Do you know how to cook?
-No, uncle.

411
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,000
Then learn.

412
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,330
We don't have enough money
for their current diet.

413
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,660
How can we afford
chicken now?

414
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:38,870
What? Sell you chicken
worth 100 rupees for 20?

415
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:40,830
And I will benefit from this deal?

416
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:44,160
Why don't you explain the math?

417
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:48,790
Look, Geeta and Babita will eventually
become famous wrestlers.

418
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:53,160
And when people will find out that
they eat chicken from your shop,

419
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:55,330
where do you think
they'll buy chicken from?

420
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:58,000
That makes sense.

421
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:59,370
But just 20 rupees?

422
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,620
There are other shops too.

423
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:02,120
Wait... listen.

424
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:05,540
Let's make it 40.

425
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:07,830
I won't give a dime
more than 25.

426
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,870
I have browned the onions,

427
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:26,120
and now this pot
will not go back in my kitchen.

428
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,540
Now, put the chicken in the pot.

429
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:51,080
And let it cook on a slow flame.

430
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,460
It's to be eaten with rice.

431
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:07,080
But... it can also be
eaten with bread.

432
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:18,790
<i>Uncle was fulfilling his duty,</i>

433
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,500
<i>and the villagers, theirs.</i>

434
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Girls are best suited
for the kitchen,

435
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,000
not for wrestling.

436
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,660
Mahavir Singh has gone mad.

437
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,870
Not mad,

438
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,210
he's become shameless.

439
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:33,620
He's getting the girls to
wear shorts and fight boys.

440
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:37,750
Since you all started wrestling,
your walk has become very manly.

441
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,750
Wonder what else will happen?

442
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:43,410
Next, it'll be my fist
and your face.

443
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,620
If only you had
given birth to a boy!

444
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:51,250
Their mother doesn't protest either.

445
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:54,210
The entire village is laughing at us.

446
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:56,660
Who will marry our girls?

447
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,910
I will make our girls so capable,

448
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:03,580
that boys will not choose them,

449
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:05,370
they will choose boys!

450
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:11,410
I am going to tell papa today,
this wrestling isn't working out.

451
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,750
Me, too.

452
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:15,620
B-O-Y... boy.

453
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:19,620
C-A-T... cat.

454
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,000
Papa, this wrestling
isn't working out...

455
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:24,750
for Babita.

456
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:28,410
Yes, papa... and,

457
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:32,410
Geeta gets so tired
that she falls asleep in class.

458
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,580
She can't concentrate
on her studies at all.

459
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:39,790
Babita's body aches terribly.

460
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,040
She keeps tossing
and turning all night.

461
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:46,790
In school, girls tease
Geeta by calling her a man.

462
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,160
Sad, isn't it?

463
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:52,370
None of these
seem like a problem.

464
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:55,790
Tell me if there is
a real problem. Read.

465
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:59,830
E-L-E-P-H-A-N-T.

466
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:03,370
Papa, our hair is getting ruined
because of wrestling in the mud.

467
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,160
She even has lice.

468
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,080
I killed eight this evening.

469
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,960
Now, that's a real problem.

470
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:19,000
Ok, be ready tomorrow at 5 a.m.

471
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:22,290
Carry on.

472
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:23,910
Papa, please.

473
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,330
We don't have any problem.

474
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:27,370
In fact, we are enjoying it.

475
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,330
Please don't cut our hair.

476
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:31,500
We will do as you say.

477
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:33,000
Ma, say something.

478
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,660
Look what papa is doing.

479
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:36,500
Please don't cut our hair, papa.

480
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,580
We'll do whatever you say.

481
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,750
We'll wake up in the morning!

482
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:42,330
Do everything...
won't ever complain.

483
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:44,330
Just don't cut our hair, please.

484
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,960
Please, papa.

485
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,370
Cut it.

486
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:49,830
Cut it?

487
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,330
Can you grow it?

488
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:55,160
Then cut it.

489
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:22,870
Getting them to wrestle
was still ok,

490
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:25,250
but it's cruel to chop their hair off!

491
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,120
They are girls, after all.

492
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:31,500
Whatever I am doing
is for their best.

493
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:35,330
Anything that distracts them
from wrestling,

494
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,660
I will get rid of!

495
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:41,660
"Is that the full moon or the sun!"

496
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:44,870
I am confused... today both
seem to have risen together.

497
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:47,750
Let it go, Babita.

498
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:50,250
Our stars are to blame.

499
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:57,120
Enough of wrestling,

500
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,370
now, it's time for a street-fight!

501
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:04,460
<i>And then, in a small village</i>
<i>of Haryana called Balali,</i>

502
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,790
<i>a grand rebellion began.</i>

503
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:12,370
<i>Revolutionaries Geeta and Babita</i>
<i>versus dictator Mahavir Singh.</i>

504
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:17,250
<i>All of uncle's arsenal</i>
<i>were neutralized one by one.</i>

505
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:21,750
<i>The alarm clock was</i>
<i>cleverly misguided.</i>

506
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,000
What happened, papa?

507
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:40,620
You are late today.

508
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,870
Age is catching up.

509
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:44,290
No problem.

510
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:46,330
We've finished today's training.

511
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:47,710
Come, Babita.

512
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:57,250
<i>Countless light bulbs were martyred.</i>

513
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,210
How come the bulb fuses every day?

514
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:02,540
Quality... papa,

515
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:03,620
quality!

516
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:07,160
<i>Injury was made an ally.</i>

517
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,040
<i>In the battlefield, surrender</i>
<i>was given without a fight.</i>

518
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:16,120
Should I give it to you?

519
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:18,500
<i>And uncle, despite having both hands,</i>

520
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:22,040
<i>felt helpless like the armless</i>
<i>character from the film 'Sholay.'</i>

521
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,210
Get out of here!

522
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:29,040
<i>I couldn't understand how</i>
<i>I had suddenly become so strong.</i>

523
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:32,330
<i>But uncle understood very well</i>
<i>why Geeta and Babita,</i>

524
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:34,540
<i>had suddenly become so weak.</i>

525
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:39,460
<i>Geeta and Babita thought</i>
<i>that they had won the war.</i>

526
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,120
Hey!

527
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:44,660
Are you going to Sunita's wedding?

528
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,620
M... mummy.

529
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:48,830
Are you trying to embarrass me?

530
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:51,370
Choose one.

531
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:52,830
This one.

532
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:01,790
Let me see.

533
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:07,500
Finally,
my girls are looking like girls.

534
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,410
Don't tell papa.

535
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:14,870
Come home before 8 p.m.

536
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:22,540
<i>"I arrive, the blushing bride"</i>

537
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:26,330
<i>"I arrive, the blushing bride"</i>

538
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:30,250
<i>"Shy... nervous"</i>

539
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:33,910
<i>"I arrive, the blushing bride"</i>

540
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:50,210
<i>"I've seen many weird things in my life"</i>

541
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:54,370
<i>"But my groom is</i>
<i>The weirdest of the lot"</i>

542
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:02,080
<i>"I've seen many weird things in my life"</i>

543
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:05,540
<i>"But my groom is</i>
<i>The weirdest of the lot"</i>

544
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:12,080
<i>"Marrying me to him is like</i>
<i>Casting pearls before swine"</i>

545
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:16,000
<i>"My groom is such a loser"</i>

546
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:19,830
<i>"My groom is a loser"</i>

547
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:27,040
<i>"My groom is such a loser"</i>

548
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,830
<i>"I told my groom,</i>
<i>Help me freshen up"</i>

549
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:44,460
<i>"Get me a toothbrush from the store"</i>

550
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:48,290
<i>"But instead of a toothbrush"</i>

551
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:50,910
<i>"He got me sugarcane from the fields"</i>

552
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,790
<i>"What a loser!"</i>

553
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:56,410
<i>"Such a loser!"</i>

554
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:02,540
<i>"My groom is such a loser"</i>

555
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:06,290
<i>"My groom is a loser"</i>

556
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:10,410
<i>"My groom is such a loser"</i>

557
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:33,790
Let it go, brother.

558
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,580
He is crazy.

559
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:51,460
We missed training
just for a day.

560
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:55,580
What was the need to create
such a big scene?

561
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:00,960
What kind of father forces
his daughters to become wrestlers?

562
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,330
Makes them wake up at 5 a.m. to run.

563
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:07,460
Works them like slaves.

564
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:09,250
Makes them fight boys.

565
00:44:09,330 --> 00:44:12,160
And if they protest,
he cuts their hair.

566
00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:15,120
May God never give
anyone such a father.

567
00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:20,830
I wish God had given me
such a father.

568
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,540
At least your father
thinks about you.

569
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:35,040
Otherwise, our reality is,

570
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:37,330
the moment a girl is born,

571
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:39,830
teach her to cook and clean,

572
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:42,580
make her do
all the household chores.

573
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,000
And, once she turns 14,

574
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:50,210
marry her off.

575
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,410
Get rid of the "burden"!

576
00:44:54,790 --> 00:44:57,330
And hand her over to a man,

577
00:44:58,290 --> 00:45:00,410
whom she has never seen before.

578
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:04,210
Make her bear children
and raise them.

579
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:07,160
That's all she's good for.

580
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:10,910
At least your father
considers you his child.

581
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:12,960
He is fighting against
the whole world.

582
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,870
He is silently tolerating
their taunts.

583
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:17,040
Why?

584
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:21,750
So that the two of you
can have a future... a life.

585
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:25,580
What is he doing wrong?

586
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:34,660
<i>"I am here to stay"</i>

587
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:37,290
<i>"Beat the best"</i>

588
00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:40,120
<i>"I am here to stay"</i>

589
00:46:40,210 --> 00:46:42,120
<i>"Beat the best"</i>

590
00:46:42,290 --> 00:46:47,540
<i>"When fortune gives you</i>
<i>A chance to prove yourself"</i>

591
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:52,910
<i>"You have barely</i>
<i>A handful of days to prepare"</i>

592
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:58,370
<i>"It asks in exchange</i>
<i>Every drop of your sweat"</i>

593
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:04,080
<i>"Know for sure</i>
<i>You gain so much more"</i>

594
00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:15,500
<i>"Fortune bows before</i>
<i>Your intense effort"</i>

595
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:17,660
<i>"So, wrestle, O Wrestler!"</i>

596
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,290
<i>"Wrestle, O Wrestler!"</i>

597
00:47:21,290 --> 00:47:24,000
<i>That day, one fact</i>
<i>became clear to me.</i>

598
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:26,500
<i>Don't know about Geeta and Babita,</i>

599
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:29,660
<i>but I sure didn't have</i>
<i>wrestling in my blood.</i>

600
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:33,790
Look at him sulk.

601
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:36,790
Give him some butter, ma.

602
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:38,250
He's become so weak.

603
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:43,460
I lost intentionally to
make you happy.

604
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:44,830
Get lost... 'TTSS'!

605
00:47:44,910 --> 00:47:46,960
"Lost intentionally..."

606
00:47:47,870 --> 00:47:49,000
Don't worry.

607
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:50,750
It'll remain between us.

608
00:47:50,830 --> 00:47:52,370
After all, you are family.

609
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,540
Your reputation is ours, too.

610
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:55,960
Don't get so cocky.

611
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,000
Watch me tomorrow.

612
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,750
You won't be able to tomorrow.

613
00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:02,500
No, uncle. Tomorrow, I will
definitely put up a tough fight.

614
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:04,710
We are going
to Rohtak tomorrow.

615
00:48:05,790 --> 00:48:06,790
For a wrestling competition.

616
00:48:12,330 --> 00:48:15,500
But, I am not ready for
a wrestling competition yet.

617
00:48:15,870 --> 00:48:18,040
Who is talking about you?

618
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:25,960
She will fight boys?

619
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,410
She won't last
two minutes, uncle.

620
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:29,580
Why?

621
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:31,160
Aren't you a boy?

622
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:33,660
She thrashed you.

623
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:45,370
<i>I had seen a lot of wrestling</i>
<i>competitions in my life.</i>

624
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:48,250
<i>But today I was going to</i>
<i>witness a bout,</i>

625
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:51,290
<i>the likes of which, had never</i>
<i>been seen before in Haryana.</i>

626
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:54,500
<i>A riot was inevitable.</i>

627
00:48:58,330 --> 00:49:01,460
Mr. Mahavir Singh Phogat...
welcome!

628
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:04,080
It's an honor that you have come
to watch the competition.

629
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:05,660
I've got a wrestler with me too.

630
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Name, please.

631
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:08,960
Geeta Kumari Phogat.

632
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:11,830
What?

633
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:14,040
Geeta Kumari Phogat.

634
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:20,040
You'll make a girl wrestle?

635
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:21,250
Yes. So?

636
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:28,500
Write.

637
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:34,750
Sir, the day I organize
a cooking competition,

638
00:49:34,910 --> 00:49:36,580
that day get Ms. Geeta along.

639
00:49:37,330 --> 00:49:38,910
This is a wrestling competition!

640
00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:42,540
We have come from very far.

641
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:45,330
We won't return without a fight.

642
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:48,080
Either Geeta will fight,

643
00:49:48,870 --> 00:49:49,870
or you and I.

644
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:53,080
First, you utter nonsense,
and then you are being stubborn too!

645
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:54,290
What do you mean?

646
00:49:54,370 --> 00:49:56,040
You want a girl
to wrestle with boys?

647
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:59,620
You may not be bothered
about your honor, but we are.

648
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:01,500
I will have your honor
laid out now!

649
00:50:02,330 --> 00:50:04,120
Please... sir.

650
00:50:04,330 --> 00:50:08,080
Please... we really respect you, sir.

651
00:50:08,290 --> 00:50:11,250
But what you ask for,
can't happen.

652
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:15,580
We can't do this, brother.

653
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,000
Let's go.

654
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,830
How dare he...

655
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,040
You are getting a chance to
play the game,

656
00:50:36,330 --> 00:50:38,580
and you are giving a walkover?

657
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:40,540
Meaning?

658
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:43,120
How many years have we been
holding wrestling competitions?

659
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:46,500
-Five.
-How many people come to watch?

660
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:48,080
Just a handful.

661
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:51,080
-So?
-Dimwit, think about it.

662
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:54,040
In a town that has never
seen a girl wrestle,

663
00:50:54,210 --> 00:50:57,250
when a girl wrestles a boy,

664
00:50:57,330 --> 00:50:59,500
how many people
will come to watch?

665
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:02,710
Our competition will go
through the roof!

666
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,660
But what if the girl
breaks her arms or legs?

667
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:06,460
Let them break.

668
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:08,790
You bandage
your broken competition.

669
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:10,830
Even if you charge
two rupees per ticket,

670
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,870
your wrestlers will eat
for months.

671
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,210
Mahavirji!

672
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:23,750
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls!

673
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:29,830
You must have seen a girl
walk on fire, eat a snake.

674
00:51:29,910 --> 00:51:32,910
But today, for the first time
in the history of Rohtak,

675
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,830
see a girl wrestling a boy
in a competition,

676
00:51:35,910 --> 00:51:38,580
in half an hour, at Lal Chowk.

677
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:40,000
Tickets - two rupees.

678
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:42,040
A wrestling girl for two rupees!

679
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:44,910
You have to win!

680
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:51,000
Even if you were to pit
your boys against a lion,

681
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:53,040
there still wouldn't have been
such a crowd.

682
00:52:00,870 --> 00:52:02,000
What do you think?

683
00:52:02,330 --> 00:52:04,080
How many seconds
will she last?

684
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:05,830
S... s... s...

685
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:08,620
Mate, by the time you finish
she'll be done and dusted.

686
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,160
Will she fight in trunks like these?

687
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:17,500
-Get lost!
-I was just hoping.

688
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:20,540
Where is she?

689
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:24,040
She looks hot.

690
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:26,040
Hope her t-shirt doesn't tear.

691
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:28,500
I hope it does!

692
00:52:37,790 --> 00:52:39,160
Go, Geeta!

693
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:45,040
Her father has lost it!

694
00:52:46,870 --> 00:52:49,040
Do you know
the rules of mud wrestling?

695
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:52,580
Then choose who you
want to lose to.

696
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,750
Who do you think she'll pick?

697
00:52:59,830 --> 00:53:02,160
Our Scrawny Spider.

698
00:53:03,330 --> 00:53:06,000
He will win for the first time.

699
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:21,460
Gosh, Jassi will beat her to a pulp!

700
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:24,040
Three of you, out of here.

701
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:27,790
Your girl has lost it.

702
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:30,660
There is still time, stop her.

703
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:33,870
Or she'll go back on a stretcher.

704
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:38,160
Before you fight a bout
you have to fight fear.

705
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:41,580
At least, my girl has conquered fear.

706
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:44,370
Go easy, she's a girl.

707
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,710
Don't make that mistake.

708
00:54:22,210 --> 00:54:24,540
Will you embarrass us?

709
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:27,790
Geeta, great going!

710
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:02,000
W... wow!

711
00:55:16,330 --> 00:55:17,580
She's gone.

712
00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:21,790
Wh... wh... what a save!

713
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:57,580
You fought well.

714
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,210
Excellent!

715
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:03,580
The committee awards
the winning wrestler, Jassi,

716
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:06,040
with a cash prize of 20 rupees.

717
00:56:07,250 --> 00:56:10,330
And from our patron, Kartar Singh,

718
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:14,040
a special prize for
Geeta Kumari of 50 rupees!

719
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:25,040
Sorry, papa.

720
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:29,210
It's ok.

721
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:30,540
Come on.

722
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:41,000
You got lucky, or you'd have
gone home on a stretcher.

723
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:53,250
Papa,

724
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:59,210
when is the next fight?

725
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:34,080
<i>"Dressed in shorts and a</i>
<i>T-shirt arrives a cyclone"</i>

726
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:38,460
<i>"Dressed in shorts and a</i>
<i>T-shirt arrives a cyclone"</i>

727
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:40,790
<i>"Make the calls, tell everyone"</i>

728
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:43,250
<i>"Watch out for the wild cat"</i>

729
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:45,500
<i>"Whether you are from</i>
<i>Chandigarh or Delhi"</i>

730
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:47,710
<i>"She will flatten you out"</i>

731
00:57:47,830 --> 00:57:51,000
<i>"She will relocate your limbs"</i>

732
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:54,330
<i>"Your attack will be met</i>
<i>With a counter-attack"</i>

733
00:57:54,410 --> 00:57:56,710
<i>"She will flatten you,</i>
<i>Flatten you out"</i>

734
00:57:56,790 --> 00:57:58,910
<i>"She's a force to reckon with"</i>

735
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,120
<i>"A force!"</i>

736
00:58:01,210 --> 00:58:03,460
<i>"She's a force to reckon with"</i>

737
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:05,750
<i>"A force!"</i>

738
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:09,870
From tomorrow you'll have to
bless her as well.

739
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:12,460
<i>"She's a force to reckon with"</i>

740
00:58:12,790 --> 00:58:14,750
<i>"A force!"</i>

741
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:16,910
<i>"What a girl!"</i>

742
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:21,750
<i>"What a girl!"</i>

743
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:26,540
<i>"Hark, O Wrestler!</i>
<i>Your ego will go up in flames"</i>

744
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:28,750
<i>"Her grip has such fire"</i>

745
00:58:28,830 --> 00:58:30,960
<i>"She will measure your self-worth"</i>

746
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:33,080
<i>"In tiny millimeters"</i>

747
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:35,120
<i>"Your breath will run out"</i>

748
00:58:35,410 --> 00:58:37,370
<i>"She will slam you so hard"</i>

749
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:39,830
<i>"She will flatten you out"</i>

750
00:58:39,910 --> 00:58:42,910
<i>"She will relocate your limbs"</i>

751
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,540
<i>"Your attack will be met</i>
<i>With a counter-attack"</i>

752
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:48,790
<i>"She will flatten you,</i>
<i>Flatten you out"</i>

753
00:58:48,870 --> 00:58:51,000
<i>"She's a force to reckon with"</i>

754
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:53,040
<i>"A force!"</i>

755
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:55,500
<i>"She's a force to reckon with"</i>

756
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:57,460
<i>"A force!"</i>

757
00:58:57,540 --> 00:58:59,830
<i>"She's a force to reckon with"</i>

758
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:01,830
<i>"A force!"</i>

759
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,290
<i>"She's a force to reckon with"</i>

760
00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:06,290
<i>"A force!"</i>

761
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:11,500
<i>Once again people had started</i>
<i>talking about Geeta and Babita.</i>

762
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:15,750
These two girls come from Balali
and thrash boys.

763
00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:18,250
This fellow lost to a girl.

764
00:59:18,330 --> 00:59:20,120
Why don't you fight her?

765
00:59:20,210 --> 00:59:23,830
<i>But this time the heckles were</i>
<i>replaced with applause!</i>

766
00:59:24,830 --> 00:59:27,460
<i>Some did not want to</i>
<i>wrestle with the girls.</i>

767
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:33,040
<i>And some didn't allow</i>
<i>them to wrestle.</i>

768
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:34,540
Please leave!

769
00:59:36,830 --> 00:59:38,710
<i>Geeta and Babita were winning</i>
<i>not just wrestling competitions,</i>

770
00:59:38,790 --> 00:59:40,160
<i>but hearts, too.</i>

771
00:59:54,750 --> 01:00:00,210
14,900... 15,000... 15,150.

772
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:05,120
You've become a senior wrestler!

773
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:09,540
By getting selected to the
Haryana state team,

774
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:11,540
Geeta Kumari has brought fame
not only to our school,

775
01:00:11,620 --> 01:00:12,830
but to the entire district of Bhiwani.

776
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:14,710
And we are sure that,

777
01:00:14,790 --> 01:00:18,540
she will make our town proud
in the National Sub-Juniors, too.

778
01:00:23,830 --> 01:00:26,710
Leave? For two months?

779
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,120
Is your daughter getting married?

780
01:00:29,790 --> 01:00:32,910
I have to prepare
Geeta for the Nationals, sir.

781
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:37,750
Forget about it.

782
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:41,540
If she was getting married,
I might have considered.

783
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:47,460
I don't understand your decisions.

784
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:50,500
I didn't have a choice.

785
01:00:51,250 --> 01:00:53,080
I couldn't let go of my dream,

786
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:55,040
so, I let go of the job.

787
01:00:55,710 --> 01:00:57,580
What will you do now?

788
01:00:58,830 --> 01:01:01,790
I'll start farming
on our own plot of land.

789
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:03,960
It's hard work,

790
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:06,910
but at least I will be able
to give the girls time.

791
01:01:14,410 --> 01:01:17,160
Titu... put this in the car.

792
01:01:18,870 --> 01:01:20,660
Wait... go...

793
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:24,910
Yes, Mahavir Singhji,
what were you saying?

794
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:29,290
If I could get some funds,
it would help a lot.

795
01:01:30,290 --> 01:01:33,870
My girl has now reached
the state level. So...

796
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:36,210
What is the big deal
in reaching state level?

797
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:38,370
That too in ladies wrestling?

798
01:01:38,620 --> 01:01:42,080
Your daughter ran alone,
and came first.

799
01:01:44,620 --> 01:01:46,040
What do you need the funds for?

800
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:51,620
Sir, I want to buy a mat
for her to train on.

801
01:01:53,870 --> 01:01:54,830
She's playing well.

802
01:01:55,830 --> 01:01:57,080
If you support her today,

803
01:01:57,160 --> 01:01:59,000
then one day, she will
make the nation proud.

804
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:00,710
Look, Mahavir Singhji,

805
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:03,160
we get this much
funding for sports.

806
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:05,620
Wrestling gets this much.

807
01:02:06,250 --> 01:02:07,580
Keep aside gents wrestling,

808
01:02:07,660 --> 01:02:11,040
then remove coaching, dieting,
traveling, equipment, etc.

809
01:02:11,210 --> 01:02:13,500
All that remains for ladies wrestling
is this much.

810
01:02:14,620 --> 01:02:17,250
And for this much,
you bought me a box of sweets.

811
01:02:19,210 --> 01:02:20,500
But you have our
complete support.

812
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:29,410
The reason India
doesn't win medals,

813
01:02:30,410 --> 01:02:32,960
is because officers like you
are warming these seats.

814
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,750
All right. I'll get up.

815
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:38,460
Titu, serve me lunch.

816
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:42,910
Mahavir Singhji,
care to join me for lunch?

817
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:52,330
The Federation is a breeding ground
for such termites.

818
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:56,370
They have ruined sports.

819
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:05,040
There is no support
for sports persons,

820
01:03:06,410 --> 01:03:09,660
only abuses when you don't win.

821
01:03:10,910 --> 01:03:14,040
Medalists don't grow on trees.

822
01:03:14,410 --> 01:03:16,660
You have to nurture them.

823
01:03:17,410 --> 01:03:20,330
With love, with hard work,
with passion.

824
01:03:24,330 --> 01:03:27,620
And here, the scoundrels don't
give money for even a mat.

825
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:31,580
What is a mat, brother?

826
01:03:31,790 --> 01:03:35,460
Synthetic mattresses
on which wrestlers fight.

827
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:40,160
A mattress is a mattress!

828
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:43,830
No?

829
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:46,410
Did I say something wrong?

830
01:03:56,330 --> 01:03:59,370
<i>Uncle had already ruined</i>
<i>our sleep, figuratively speaking.</i>

831
01:03:59,620 --> 01:04:02,250
<i>Now he was hell bent</i>
<i>on doing it literally, too.</i>

832
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:20,960
Wrestling on a mat is different
from mud wrestling.

833
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:23,160
Now we have to wrestle
on the mat.

834
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:26,330
And in mat wrestling
you have to score points.

835
01:04:26,620 --> 01:04:31,710
You can score one, two,
three or five points.

836
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:33,830
Omkar...

837
01:04:37,910 --> 01:04:40,210
If you hold the opponent
by the waist,

838
01:04:40,370 --> 01:04:42,290
and drop him to his knees,

839
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:44,000
then you score one point.

840
01:04:44,750 --> 01:04:49,040
And from the ground position
if you roll him on to his back,

841
01:04:49,330 --> 01:04:50,790
then you score two points.

842
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,620
There are different ways
to do this.

843
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:53,910
Uncle!

844
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,910
Like this.

845
01:04:56,790 --> 01:05:00,250
Or from the ground position,
like this!

846
01:05:02,870 --> 01:05:09,080
If you flip your opponent on his back
from a standing position,

847
01:05:09,290 --> 01:05:11,540
then you will score three points.

848
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:14,210
Please, uncle!

849
01:05:14,370 --> 01:05:16,000
Like this... three points.

850
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:18,750
Like this... from standing position...
on to his back.

851
01:05:19,580 --> 01:05:23,660
To score five points is difficult,
but it can be done.

852
01:05:24,330 --> 01:05:26,750
If you flip your opponent
from a standing position,

853
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:29,910
above your head
in a rainbow-like arc,

854
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,580
and have him fall on his back,

855
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:33,580
then you score five points!

856
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:35,330
-Watch.
-No... no, please, uncle!

857
01:05:35,410 --> 01:05:37,080
-Come here.
-No, please.

858
01:05:41,580 --> 01:05:43,330
A real wrestling mat is not like this.

859
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:47,120
It's like this.

860
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:07,040
<i>We have to fight</i>
<i>in the yellow area.</i>

861
01:06:15,410 --> 01:06:18,040
<i>The red zone is a danger area.</i>

862
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:22,250
<i>If you step out of it,</i>
<i>you lose a point.</i>

863
01:06:29,750 --> 01:06:33,080
<i>There are three rounds</i>
<i>of two minutes each.</i>

864
01:06:33,620 --> 01:06:36,540
<i>Three rounds</i>
<i>of two minutes each.</i>

865
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:41,960
<i>Whoever wins two out of</i>
<i>three rounds, wins the match.</i>

866
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:49,750
Sir, your daughter is underweight.

867
01:06:50,580 --> 01:06:51,460
So?

868
01:06:51,620 --> 01:06:52,960
Take my advice.
Go back.

869
01:06:53,290 --> 01:06:55,290
Feed her,

870
01:06:55,540 --> 01:06:57,960
fatten her and
come back next year.

871
01:06:58,410 --> 01:07:01,370
If she fights like this,
she will break her bones.

872
01:07:02,250 --> 01:07:05,000
You just tell me whether
she is allowed to wrestle or not.

873
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:08,460
Yes... she is.

874
01:07:08,750 --> 01:07:10,250
Sign up.

875
01:07:13,210 --> 01:07:16,750
Sub-Junior Nationals

876
01:07:19,710 --> 01:07:20,540
Good move!

877
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:37,160
<i>Geeta had defeated beefy boys,</i>

878
01:07:37,460 --> 01:07:40,160
<i>how long could these girls survive?</i>

879
01:07:43,250 --> 01:07:44,620
Is that a girl or a storm?

880
01:07:51,410 --> 01:07:55,910
Sub-Junior National Champion

881
01:07:56,460 --> 01:07:58,410
Junior Nationals

882
01:07:58,580 --> 01:07:59,580
Is she underweight?

883
01:07:59,790 --> 01:08:02,620
Yes... but how does it matter?

884
01:08:26,250 --> 01:08:32,660
Junior National Champion

885
01:08:46,830 --> 01:08:50,330
<i>Time flew by.</i>

886
01:08:52,410 --> 01:08:54,830
<i>Geeta went from junior to senior.</i>

887
01:08:56,750 --> 01:08:57,660
<i>And uncle,</i>

888
01:08:57,830 --> 01:09:00,620
<i>from senior to senior-citizen.</i>

889
01:09:04,460 --> 01:09:05,910
Go... Geeta!

890
01:09:07,830 --> 01:09:11,580
<i>Babita and I, went from</i>
<i>shorts to full length pants!</i>

891
01:09:35,620 --> 01:09:37,660
Push... push her down!

892
01:09:40,460 --> 01:09:42,080
Side throw!

893
01:09:55,910 --> 01:09:58,410
Victory to Haryana!

894
01:10:20,580 --> 01:10:22,290
National Champion

895
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:43,580
Finally uncle's dream
has been achieved.

896
01:10:43,750 --> 01:10:46,580
Now we can all relax.

897
01:10:46,870 --> 01:10:47,710
No.

898
01:10:49,750 --> 01:10:51,330
My dream remains to be fulfilled.

899
01:10:52,910 --> 01:10:55,870
Every year sees
a National champion.

900
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,330
My dream will be fulfilled,

901
01:10:59,790 --> 01:11:01,790
when you win gold,
not for yourself,

902
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:03,540
but for your country.

903
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:10,040
You can celebrate today.

904
01:11:10,410 --> 01:11:12,410
From tomorrow we start
preparing further.

905
01:11:19,250 --> 01:11:20,620
Papa...

906
01:11:23,660 --> 01:11:25,960
Need to speak to you.

907
01:11:26,540 --> 01:11:27,750
Tell me.

908
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:29,460
Papa,

909
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:34,080
now that I am a
National champion, so...

910
01:11:35,540 --> 01:11:36,410
So?

911
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:37,870
No, I mean,

912
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:42,410
all National champions
need to go to Patiala,

913
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:44,120
for further training.

914
01:11:44,410 --> 01:11:45,910
To the National Sports Academy.

915
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,460
What are you getting at?

916
01:11:47,620 --> 01:11:49,080
Tell me clearly.

917
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:52,290
I will have to go too, papa.

918
01:11:53,460 --> 01:11:56,910
From now, I'll have to train there,

919
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:01,500
under the national coach.

920
01:12:15,660 --> 01:12:17,330
Geeta Kumari Phogat.

921
01:12:17,410 --> 01:12:18,790
Wrestling.

922
01:12:37,540 --> 01:12:39,250
The place looks good.

923
01:12:41,370 --> 01:12:42,830
Let's hope the coach is good too.

924
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,710
Girls, come on.

925
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:57,370
You all must be rejoicing,

926
01:12:57,460 --> 01:13:00,330
at the thought of
advanced training.

927
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:04,460
Well, forget about learning,

928
01:13:04,910 --> 01:13:06,330
first you have to learn to forget!

929
01:13:07,370 --> 01:13:09,500
Forget the wrong training
you've received.

930
01:13:09,870 --> 01:13:11,960
Wrong diet, wrong exercise,
wrong technique.

931
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:14,830
And after forgetting all that,

932
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:16,750
your real training will begin,

933
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:19,500
with National Coach,
Pramod Kadam.

934
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:24,330
And you will only learn
what I teach you.

935
01:13:25,790 --> 01:13:27,620
-Is that clear?
-Yes, sir!

936
01:13:27,710 --> 01:13:30,290
-Is that clear?
-Yes, sir!

937
01:13:30,620 --> 01:13:31,460
Good.

938
01:13:32,210 --> 01:13:33,040
Warm up.

939
01:13:33,710 --> 01:13:34,580
Get me tea!

940
01:13:37,750 --> 01:13:38,870
Come on, girls.

941
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:41,750
Energy... more energy!

942
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,710
Yes, that's the way.

943
01:13:43,790 --> 01:13:44,620
Keep it up!

944
01:13:45,580 --> 01:13:47,580
-Good.
-Namaste, sir.

945
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:50,410
Sir, I am Mahavir Singh Phogat.

946
01:13:50,790 --> 01:13:51,960
Geeta's father.

947
01:13:53,540 --> 01:13:54,370
Ok.

948
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:56,120
I am the one who has trained her.

949
01:13:56,580 --> 01:13:58,790
Yes... good.

950
01:14:00,620 --> 01:14:01,620
She's good.

951
01:14:01,710 --> 01:14:04,500
Very strong, with a lot of stamina.

952
01:14:07,620 --> 01:14:09,830
Where's my tea?

953
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:12,870
Come on... move it!

954
01:14:20,620 --> 01:14:21,910
Sir... one request.

955
01:14:23,540 --> 01:14:25,710
If Geeta gets the right coaching,

956
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:28,500
she will definitely win
an international medal.

957
01:14:30,710 --> 01:14:31,710
Geeta!

958
01:14:34,410 --> 01:14:38,500
There should be a 90 degree
angle between your calf and thigh.

959
01:14:38,870 --> 01:14:40,250
Who has taught you?

960
01:14:42,620 --> 01:14:44,960
Is this how you will win
an international medal?

961
01:14:49,830 --> 01:14:51,040
You came to drop her, right?

962
01:14:52,540 --> 01:14:54,040
You've done that.

963
01:14:55,540 --> 01:14:56,960
Now leave the rest to me.

964
01:14:58,870 --> 01:15:00,460
Don't waste my time!

965
01:15:38,830 --> 01:15:40,040
Is Geeta happy?

966
01:15:42,910 --> 01:15:45,370
The institute must be
very big, isn't it?

967
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:51,120
Everyone there must be
a champion, isn't it?

968
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:54,540
And the facilities there
must be amazing, right?

969
01:15:54,790 --> 01:15:55,870
Have you trained today?

970
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:58,210
Yes. And the coach
must be top notch?

971
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:00,120
You seem very eager
to go there.

972
01:16:02,750 --> 01:16:04,460
Remember, I am still your coach.

973
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:08,750
Your first time
away from home?

974
01:16:10,540 --> 01:16:13,830
Just you wait...
we'll have a blast.

975
01:16:15,710 --> 01:16:18,080
Girls, 'DDLJ' is showing on TV.

976
01:16:18,370 --> 01:16:19,210
Wow!

977
01:16:19,710 --> 01:16:21,040
Let's watch.

978
01:16:21,250 --> 01:16:22,410
I am going to sleep.

979
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:25,000
You can't say no
to Shah Rukh Khan.

980
01:16:25,290 --> 01:16:26,580
It's a sin.

981
01:16:26,750 --> 01:16:27,580
Come.

982
01:16:31,210 --> 01:16:36,000
<i>Raj, if this girl loves you,</i>
<i>she will turn to look at you.</i>

983
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:37,830
Please turn.

984
01:16:39,870 --> 01:16:40,830

985
01:16:41,250 --> 01:16:42,210
Turn.

986
01:16:45,620 --> 01:16:46,710
Turn.

987
01:16:47,580 --> 01:16:48,540
<i>Turn.</i>

988
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:52,000
She turned!

989
01:17:03,710 --> 01:17:07,250
Just grow your hair.
You will kill it.

990
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:09,580
A rhino uses strength,

991
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:12,910
but the tiger uses both
strength and technique.

992
01:17:13,290 --> 01:17:15,330
Be a tiger, not a rhino.

993
01:17:15,540 --> 01:17:16,370
Clear?

I am going.
Coach sir is waiting.

01:19:21,870 --> 01:19:22,870

Come here.

1037
01:19:41,540 --> 01:19:43,750
Forget your papa's technique.

1038
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Learn only what I teach you.

1039
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:46,910
Got that?

1040
01:19:48,580 --> 01:19:49,410
Hello!

1041
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:52,290
Sorry, Geeta has gone out.

1042
01:19:56,330 --> 01:19:59,620
For years I have been losing
to both of you intentionally.

1043
01:20:01,370 --> 01:20:02,830
It is the truth!

1044
01:20:04,620 --> 01:20:07,000
That's it!
You see?

1045
01:20:07,540 --> 01:20:10,370
Wrestlers shine only when
the technique is right.

1046
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:12,750
Win the Nationals soon.

1047
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,250
You too will be sorted.

1048
01:20:14,580 --> 01:20:16,830
Yes... when are you coming home?

1049
01:20:16,910 --> 01:20:18,620
I am coming next week.

1050
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:19,830
Need something?

1051
01:20:19,910 --> 01:20:21,370
Nothing. You get here.

1052
01:20:21,870 --> 01:20:22,830
Ok.

1053
01:20:30,750 --> 01:20:32,000
Did you like it?

1054
01:20:32,250 --> 01:20:33,080
Really?

1055
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:34,580
You grew out your hair.

1056
01:20:34,790 --> 01:20:36,370
It's looking good.

1057
01:20:37,540 --> 01:20:39,540
Your papa won't like it.

1058
01:20:42,540 --> 01:20:45,080
Now everything can't work
the way papa wants.

1059
01:20:45,330 --> 01:20:46,710
Coach sir didn't say anything.

1060
01:20:46,870 --> 01:20:48,620
And he is such an accomplished coach.

1061
01:20:50,250 --> 01:20:52,580
You do as you please over there.

1062
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:54,540
Just be a little careful here.

1063
01:20:54,620 --> 01:20:57,620
Mummy, real training happens
with a lot of freedom.

1064
01:20:57,790 --> 01:20:59,160
Not with so many restrictions.

1065
01:20:59,370 --> 01:21:02,500
We watch movies,
television, eat out, too.

1066
01:21:02,830 --> 01:21:05,000
My performance hasn't suffered.

1067
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:07,120
I am the topmost wrestler
at the NSA.

1068
01:21:08,290 --> 01:21:10,120
You home, wrestler?

1069
01:21:18,460 --> 01:21:20,410
-How are you?
-I am fine, papa.

1070
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,210
How's your training going?

1071
01:21:23,460 --> 01:21:25,710
She's going to Sydney for a fight.

1072
01:21:27,910 --> 01:21:29,250
How's your training going?

1073
01:21:29,460 --> 01:21:31,120
It's going very well, papa.

1074
01:21:31,210 --> 01:21:32,580
You've seen...

1075
01:21:32,660 --> 01:21:34,660
I am learning a lot of new things.

1076
01:21:34,750 --> 01:21:37,080
New strategy, moves,
technique...

1077
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:38,160
very good.

1078
01:21:38,290 --> 01:21:41,500
I have thought that
I will teach her some things, too.

1079
01:21:42,460 --> 01:21:44,540
After all, she too has to
win the Nationals.

1080
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,580
You've grown your hair.

1081
01:21:51,460 --> 01:21:52,790
-Papa...
-No.

1082
01:21:54,580 --> 01:21:55,620
It's good.

1083
01:22:01,620 --> 01:22:04,210
Don't just attack,
you've to defend, too.

1084
01:22:04,370 --> 01:22:05,540
Hold me.

1085
01:22:05,790 --> 01:22:07,500
Now, how will you free yourself?

1086
01:22:07,660 --> 01:22:11,290
Hold this way, break and attack. Got that?

1087
01:22:11,370 --> 01:22:13,540
That's an old technique.

1088
01:22:14,460 --> 01:22:15,290
Let me...

1089
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:18,290
Hold me.

1090
01:22:19,290 --> 01:22:20,580
Tight.

1091
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:23,960
Push your thumbs in this way,

1092
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:25,080
and move it to the side.

1093
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:28,000
Not in the front... but to the side.
Break and attack.

1094
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:30,040
What's wrong with my technique?

1095
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:32,040
What's wrong?

1096
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:33,790
No, papa. It's not wrong.

1097
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:37,000
This is more correct.
Coach sir has taught it.

1098
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:38,960
So now you are an expert?

1099
01:22:39,210 --> 01:22:40,790
International?

1100
01:22:41,620 --> 01:22:42,960
Papa, I was...

1101
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:46,790
I'd like to know, what is it that
your coach sir has taught you,

1102
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:48,620
that your father couldn't.

1103
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:54,040
Not her, show me.

1104
01:22:55,210 --> 01:22:56,330
Come on.

1105
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:00,960
Push your thumbs in this way...

1106
01:23:05,830 --> 01:23:08,040
So, this is what your coach sir
has taught you!

1107
01:23:08,330 --> 01:23:10,910
Is this how you'll win
an international medal?

1108
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:19,750
I wasn't ready, papa.

1109
01:23:20,790 --> 01:23:22,000
So, get ready.

1110
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:05,580
This is what I was saying, papa.

1111
01:26:08,330 --> 01:26:09,830
Isn't there a difference?

1112
01:26:55,540 --> 01:26:57,460
What happened today
wasn't right.

1113
01:26:58,080 --> 01:26:59,830
What wasn't right?

1114
01:27:00,620 --> 01:27:02,210
This was bound to happen.

1115
01:27:02,290 --> 01:27:05,120
Someone had to tell papa
that his techniques are weak.

1116
01:27:05,210 --> 01:27:07,580
His techniques aren't weak.

1117
01:27:07,660 --> 01:27:09,660
He's become a little weak.

1118
01:27:09,750 --> 01:27:11,370
And don't forget that
you've won the Nationals,

1119
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:13,540
based on his "weak" techniques.

1120
01:27:13,750 --> 01:27:17,540
You can win the Nationals
with these techniques, Babita,

1121
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:19,460
not international matches.

1122
01:27:19,540 --> 01:27:22,960
And the sooner
you realize this, the better.

1123
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,370
All right.

1124
01:27:29,750 --> 01:27:32,250
You keep faith in your techniques.

1125
01:27:32,620 --> 01:27:35,080
I still put my faith in papa.

1126
01:27:35,870 --> 01:27:40,500
I pray to God that you fight
well at the Nationals.

1127
01:27:41,870 --> 01:27:45,540
And I pray that you do well
in your international tournament.

1167
01:31:29,660 --> 01:31:30,830
Go... Babita!

1168
01:31:33,330 --> 01:31:34,620
Throw her.

1169
01:31:52,120 --> 01:31:53,870
What are you doing, Geeta?

1170
01:32:02,660 --> 01:32:03,620
What are you doing, Geeta?

1171
01:32:03,710 --> 01:32:04,910
Defend!

1172
01:32:07,540 --> 01:32:08,910
Attack!

1173
01:32:11,330 --> 01:32:12,290
Good one!

1174
01:32:17,080 --> 01:32:18,160
Is this how you defend?

1175
01:32:18,410 --> 01:32:21,080
The next round, too,
play attacking.

1176
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:08,120
You don't look happy, papa.

1177
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,370
Didn't I fight properly?

1178
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:14,330
No, my dear.

1179
01:33:14,620 --> 01:33:16,870
You fought exactly as I expected.

1180
01:33:20,330 --> 01:33:25,250
But, I never imagined Geeta
would fight like this.

1181
01:33:29,830 --> 01:33:32,250
And now, you too,
have won the Nationals.

1182
01:33:32,580 --> 01:33:34,040
You too, will go to NSA.

1183
01:33:34,790 --> 01:33:36,460
You'll have a new coach.

1184
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:41,460
And your papa once again
will become old.

1185
01:33:45,370 --> 01:33:46,290
No, papa.

1186
01:33:53,160 --> 01:33:55,460
Never forget,

1187
01:33:57,830 --> 01:34:00,290
how you got till here.

1188
01:34:17,410 --> 01:34:18,960
Hey, champion.

1189
01:34:20,410 --> 01:34:21,410
Hello, sis.

1190
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:26,540
Still upset?

1191
01:34:29,710 --> 01:34:30,540
Come.

1192
01:34:31,080 --> 01:34:33,210
-What did you fill in the bag?
-Let me get it.

1193
01:34:33,290 --> 01:34:34,410
It's so heavy.

1194
01:34:35,290 --> 01:34:36,460
Hi, Jasmeet!

1195
01:34:37,710 --> 01:34:40,370
This is my younger sister, Babita.

1196
01:34:40,460 --> 01:34:43,330
Whoa! A family of wrestlers!

1197
01:34:44,830 --> 01:34:46,040
Here is the mess.

1198
01:34:46,160 --> 01:34:47,870
This is were we hog.

1199
01:34:52,460 --> 01:34:54,000
This is the lounge.

1200
01:34:54,160 --> 01:34:56,870
Here we chill and watch TV.

1201
01:34:57,660 --> 01:34:59,750
Where is the training center?

1202
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:04,120
My, aren't you eager!

1203
01:35:04,750 --> 01:35:07,250
See it tomorrow.
Rest today.

1204
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,620
Can I say something?

1205
01:35:13,750 --> 01:35:15,000
Don't feel offended.

1206
01:35:16,290 --> 01:35:17,410
Tell me.

1207
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,080
You've changed a lot.

1208
01:35:22,540 --> 01:35:26,830
I remember the first time
you lost a match.

1209
01:35:27,660 --> 01:35:29,620
You couldn't sleep all night.

1210
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:34,080
And now, in spite of losing an
international fight you are...

1211
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:38,870
I mean, it doesn't show
at all on your face.

1212
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:43,210
Has papa trained you
to say this?

1213
01:35:44,210 --> 01:35:47,040
I remember papa's training
very well.

1214
01:35:47,870 --> 01:35:49,410
It seems you've forgotten.

1215
01:35:49,660 --> 01:35:52,410
You focus on your training.

1216
01:35:52,660 --> 01:35:54,290
I will manage mine.

1217
01:35:55,160 --> 01:35:56,830
And why are you lecturing me?

1218
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:58,790
I've only lost one match.

1219
01:36:03,710 --> 01:36:04,750
Moscow

1220
01:36:04,830 --> 01:36:07,210
<i>Geeta Kumari is trailing</i>
<i>in the second round as well.</i>

1221
01:36:07,290 --> 01:36:10,330
<i>She's fought well,</i>
<i>but hasn't managed much.</i>

1222
01:36:10,410 --> 01:36:11,910
<i>Geeta tries,</i>

1223
01:36:12,750 --> 01:36:14,620
<i>but Kasha scores one point.</i>

1224
01:36:15,330 --> 01:36:17,040
<i>And that's it!</i>

1225
01:36:17,540 --> 01:36:21,040
<i>Geeta Kumari makes an early exit</i>
<i>from the world championship.</i>

1226
01:36:21,910 --> 01:36:24,410
<i>What a disappointment!</i>

1227
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:29,120
<i>Yet another defeat for</i>
<i>India's Geeta Kumari Phogat.</i>

1228
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:35,500
<i>In Jakarta too, Geeta exits</i>
<i>in the first round.</i>

1229
01:36:36,830 --> 01:36:40,500
<i>A humiliating defeat for Geeta</i>
<i>in the Istanbul World Championship!</i>

1230
01:36:40,750 --> 01:36:44,410
<i>She will have to wait longer to win</i>
<i>an international medal.</i>

1231
01:36:54,500 --> 01:36:56,040
Geeta, don't lose hope.

1232
01:36:56,210 --> 01:36:58,040
We've worked very hard.
And you played well.

1233
01:36:58,210 --> 01:36:59,410
You just couldn't win.

1234
01:36:59,910 --> 01:37:02,000
It doesn't mean you are
a bad wrestler.

1235
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:03,790
It happens.

1236
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,830
Some people are not made
for international victory.

1237
01:37:32,750 --> 01:37:34,540
Do you feel too,

1238
01:37:36,540 --> 01:37:38,710
that I am not cut out
for an international medal?

1239
01:37:42,710 --> 01:37:45,000
I don't know about that.

1240
01:37:46,040 --> 01:37:48,040
All I know,

1241
01:37:48,830 --> 01:37:50,500
is that you are the girl,

1242
01:37:50,710 --> 01:37:53,000
who thrashed boys
in mud wrestling.

1243
01:37:54,870 --> 01:37:56,210
You are the girl,

1244
01:37:56,410 --> 01:37:59,410
who in spite of being
underweight, won sub-juniors.

1245
01:38:01,460 --> 01:38:04,660
You beat everyone at the Nationals
for three straight years.

1246
01:38:07,710 --> 01:38:10,290
If you are not cut out
for international victory,

1247
01:38:10,460 --> 01:38:14,500
then I don't know
which girl in India is.

1248
01:38:21,370 --> 01:38:24,160
I have a lot of faith in you,

1249
01:38:25,410 --> 01:38:28,210
but it's nothing compared to
the faith that papa has in you.

1250
01:38:31,540 --> 01:38:33,460
Talk to him once.

1251
01:38:36,460 --> 01:38:38,410
How do I face him?

1252
01:38:38,710 --> 01:38:40,660
He's our papa.

1253
01:38:42,330 --> 01:38:44,160
At worst, what will happen?

1254
01:38:44,580 --> 01:38:46,000
He will give you an earful.

1255
01:38:46,290 --> 01:38:47,580
Take it.

1256
01:38:48,500 --> 01:38:51,210
His reprimands have
always helped us, haven't they?

1257
01:38:59,330 --> 01:39:00,710
Your medicine.

1258
01:39:05,710 --> 01:39:07,040
I spoke to Babita.

1259
01:39:07,500 --> 01:39:10,120
She said the training
was going well.

1260
01:39:14,750 --> 01:39:15,790
And?

1261
01:39:18,620 --> 01:39:20,290
Geeta is not ok.

1262
01:39:21,910 --> 01:39:23,660
Please talk to her once.

1263
01:39:40,540 --> 01:39:41,660
Hello.

1264
01:39:43,160 --> 01:39:44,160
Geeta?

1265
01:39:45,910 --> 01:39:47,830
Ok, wait.

1266
01:39:49,660 --> 01:39:50,620
Geeta...

1267
01:40:37,830 --> 01:40:39,540
Sorry, papa.

1268
01:41:06,120 --> 01:41:10,290
Only six months remain for
the 19th Commonwealth Games,

1269
01:41:10,370 --> 01:41:12,960
the biggest sporting event in India.

1270
01:41:13,410 --> 01:41:18,830
What remains to be seen is how
the Indian players hold up,

1271
01:41:19,080 --> 01:41:22,210
against the world's best.

1272
01:41:41,250 --> 01:41:45,000
This time in the Commonwealth games,
I want three medals.

1273
01:41:45,290 --> 01:41:46,660
Now, whether they come
from you three,

1274
01:41:46,750 --> 01:41:48,040
you three or you three!

1275
01:41:48,250 --> 01:41:49,210
I don't care.

1276
01:41:49,290 --> 01:41:50,500
There are six months left.

1277
01:41:50,710 --> 01:41:52,080
Give your best.

1278
01:41:52,460 --> 01:41:53,410
Got that?

1279
01:41:53,830 --> 01:41:54,660
Get cracking!

1280
01:41:55,080 --> 01:41:55,960
Geeta.

1281
01:41:56,080 --> 01:41:56,910
Come here.

1282
01:42:00,370 --> 01:42:02,540
-You will get one medal.
-Yes, sir.

1283
01:42:02,620 --> 01:42:04,870
Not in the category
that you are losing in,

1284
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:07,620
but in the category
in which you can win.

1285
01:42:07,870 --> 01:42:08,710
Got me?

1286
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:13,290
It's difficult for you to survive
in the 55 kilo category.

1287
01:42:13,500 --> 01:42:16,000
You too must have
realized that by now.

1288
01:42:16,250 --> 01:42:17,580
In the 51 kilo category,

1289
01:42:17,660 --> 01:42:20,290
you can hold your own,
and maybe win.

1290
01:42:21,790 --> 01:42:23,960
Monitor everyone's diet strictly.

1291
01:42:24,160 --> 01:42:25,500
-No mess ups.
-Sir!

1292
01:42:27,620 --> 01:42:29,750
Sir, I want to fight in the
55 kilo category!

1293
01:42:31,710 --> 01:42:34,500
If you fight in the 55 kilo category
you'll get nowhere!

1294
01:42:38,250 --> 01:42:39,910
She has to lose four kilos.

1295
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:41,460
Change her diet.

1296
01:42:41,620 --> 01:42:43,790
From tomorrow we'll start your
training for the 51 kilo category.

1297
01:42:45,120 --> 01:42:46,410
Come on, girls.

1298
01:42:50,210 --> 01:42:52,290
Why won't you win
in the 55 kilo category?

1299
01:42:52,580 --> 01:42:54,620
No need for you
to lose weight!

1300
01:42:54,870 --> 01:42:57,500
You will fight in the
55 kilo category, and win!

1301
01:42:57,870 --> 01:42:59,750
I am coming to Patiala.

1302
01:43:07,040 --> 01:43:09,540
We don't know anyone in Patiala.

1303
01:43:09,870 --> 01:43:11,830
How will you stay for six months?

1304
01:43:12,080 --> 01:43:13,210
On rent.

1305
01:43:13,370 --> 01:43:14,500
And food?

1306
01:43:14,750 --> 01:43:15,750
I'll cook.

1307
01:43:15,830 --> 01:43:17,460
I'll cook, uncle!

1308
01:43:18,750 --> 01:43:20,790
I was thinking that
I too could come along.

1309
01:43:21,750 --> 01:43:22,870
What will you do there?

1310
01:43:23,210 --> 01:43:26,620
Well, in the past they did well
when they trained with me.

1311
01:43:26,790 --> 01:43:28,910
So, if they train with me
in the future too...

1312
01:43:29,120 --> 01:43:31,250
Honestly, I think I am
their good luck charm.

1313
01:43:32,410 --> 01:43:33,910
I mean... that's what I think.

1314
01:43:35,540 --> 01:43:39,120
And, I will buy vegetables for you,
chop them for you,

1315
01:43:39,290 --> 01:43:41,750
run errands for you,
press your feet.

1316
01:43:42,120 --> 01:43:43,580
I'll make sure you are stress-free.

1317
01:43:43,790 --> 01:43:45,620
You see...
it's the Commonwealth Games.

1318
01:43:45,830 --> 01:43:47,330
We can't take any chances.

1319
01:43:52,540 --> 01:43:54,370
Start preparing for gold!

1320
01:43:54,580 --> 01:43:57,290
Patiala

1321
01:44:00,710 --> 01:44:02,410
The room is on top.

1322
01:44:03,460 --> 01:44:04,290
Come.

1323
01:44:07,620 --> 01:44:09,710
Is there no other room,
in the same budget?

1324
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:11,000
It's nice.

1325
01:44:11,080 --> 01:44:12,250
Yes!

1326
01:44:12,330 --> 01:44:13,540
It's nice, indeed.

1327
01:44:13,830 --> 01:44:14,870
I have to admit!

1328
01:44:20,080 --> 01:44:21,000
Yes?

1329
01:44:21,080 --> 01:44:25,290
Geeta and Babita Kumari's
father and close cousin.

1330
01:44:30,120 --> 01:44:32,250
Holy cow!

1331
01:44:40,210 --> 01:44:42,580
Uncle, doesn't this place
seem lovely?

1332
01:45:00,580 --> 01:45:01,790
How are you, champ?

1333
01:45:06,370 --> 01:45:07,210
And you?

1334
01:45:07,290 --> 01:45:08,500
I am good, papa.

1335
01:45:10,040 --> 01:45:10,910
Why are you here?

1336
01:45:11,080 --> 01:45:12,750
Uncle insisted that I come.

1337
01:45:12,830 --> 01:45:15,080
He said it's the Commonwealth Games.
We can't take a chance.

1338
01:45:15,160 --> 01:45:16,410
Shut up, 'TTSS'!

1339
01:45:18,870 --> 01:45:21,250
Geeta's 51 kilo category
training has started,

1340
01:45:21,330 --> 01:45:22,710
and the diet too.

1341
01:45:24,710 --> 01:45:26,830
You continue their diet and training,

1342
01:45:27,290 --> 01:45:29,710
I'll supplement the rest.

1343
01:45:32,120 --> 01:45:34,040
What time does
your training start?

1344
01:45:34,460 --> 01:45:35,290
7 a.m.

1345
01:45:36,250 --> 01:45:37,330
Ok.

1346
01:45:37,460 --> 01:45:39,000
Be ready at 5 a.m. tomorrow.

1347
01:45:51,710 --> 01:45:54,040
<i>"I am here to stay"</i>

1348
01:45:54,120 --> 01:45:56,790
<i>"Beat the best"</i>

1349
01:45:56,870 --> 01:45:59,540
<i>"I am here to stay"</i>

1350
01:45:59,620 --> 01:46:01,660
<i>"Beat the best"</i>

1351
01:46:01,750 --> 01:46:06,960
<i>"Hold on firmly to your dreams"</i>

1352
01:46:07,080 --> 01:46:12,410
<i>"Don't pay heed to what</i>
<i>Naysayers and cynics say"</i>

1353
01:46:12,500 --> 01:46:17,660
<i>"It's their turn today,</i>
<i>Let them have their say"</i>

1354
01:46:17,830 --> 01:46:24,210
<i>"Your turn will come too;</i>
<i>Prove your point then!"</i>

1355
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:34,790
<i>"One roar of the lion silences</i>
<i>The bleating of a thousand sheep"</i>

1356
01:46:34,870 --> 01:46:36,750
<i>"So, wrestle, O Wrestler!"</i>

1357
01:46:37,540 --> 01:46:39,370
<i>"Wrestle, O Wrestler!"</i>

1358
01:46:40,160 --> 01:46:42,710
<i>"Your glory may rise and fall"</i>

1359
01:46:42,790 --> 01:46:45,370
<i>"Cause up in the sky</i>
<i>Your stars are wrestling too"</i>

1360
01:46:45,460 --> 01:46:47,250
<i>"So, wrestle, O Wrestler!"</i>

1361
01:46:48,370 --> 01:46:50,120
<i>"Wrestle, O Wrestler!"</i>

1362
01:47:07,910 --> 01:47:09,210
Stop... stop.

1363
01:47:09,910 --> 01:47:11,460
Straight attacks won't do.

1364
01:47:11,830 --> 01:47:13,870
You have to play with
the opponent's mind.

1365
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:19,120
Fake a move...
but make another.

1366
01:47:23,620 --> 01:47:24,660
Sir.

1367
01:47:34,830 --> 01:47:36,410
Sir, I had put her on a diet,

1368
01:47:36,500 --> 01:47:38,620
but, I don't know why
it hasn't reduced.

1369
01:47:40,710 --> 01:47:42,370
What have you been up to, Geeta?

1370
01:47:44,710 --> 01:47:47,160
Will you say something
or just keep crying?

1371
01:47:57,040 --> 01:48:01,250
Sir, judging by their actions
I feel they don't need NSA.

1372
01:48:02,370 --> 01:48:04,410
The rest is up to you.

1373
01:48:08,120 --> 01:48:10,000
Do you all have anything to say?

1374
01:48:13,660 --> 01:48:16,000
So you admit you are at fault.

1375
01:48:16,580 --> 01:48:18,790
Sir, they have just one fault.

1376
01:48:19,160 --> 01:48:20,750
That their father is crazy.

1377
01:48:23,080 --> 01:48:26,710
He is so crazy about getting
a gold for the country,

1378
01:48:27,660 --> 01:48:30,330
that in their childhood itself
he snatched away their toys,

1379
01:48:30,540 --> 01:48:32,250
and made them wrestle.

1380
01:48:33,580 --> 01:48:35,870
When they resisted,
he cut their hair off.

1381
01:48:36,290 --> 01:48:39,410
In order to prepare them,
he made them wrestle boys.

1382
01:48:39,790 --> 01:48:42,250
Took the taunts and abuses
of the entire village,

1383
01:48:43,330 --> 01:48:45,580
just so that one day they would
make the country proud.

1384
01:48:55,080 --> 01:48:56,290
Look, sir.

1385
01:48:56,660 --> 01:48:57,500
Look.

1386
01:48:57,580 --> 01:48:59,500
These 50 rupees
she won at Rohtak.

1387
01:48:59,830 --> 01:49:01,210
This in Hisar.

1388
01:49:02,540 --> 01:49:03,830
This in Chandigarh.

1389
01:49:04,460 --> 01:49:08,370
This... this, all this... sir.

1390
01:49:09,120 --> 01:49:12,540
These girls have traveled
a long way to reach here, sir.

1391
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,710
Now don't tell them to turn back.

1392
01:49:16,290 --> 01:49:17,580
It's all my fault.

1393
01:49:17,910 --> 01:49:19,540
I humbly apologize.

1394
01:49:27,910 --> 01:49:30,250
Coach-sir is just concerned
with getting three medals.

1395
01:49:30,410 --> 01:49:32,290
No matter if they are bronze.

1396
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,660
But I want our country
to win gold.

1397
01:49:36,410 --> 01:49:38,540
And this girl can do it, sir.

1398
01:49:50,370 --> 01:49:52,080
All of you, please wait outside.

1399
01:50:01,710 --> 01:50:04,250
You've made a mistake
by wasting time.

1400
01:50:05,620 --> 01:50:08,620
In 55 kilos, Geeta won't even
get selected for India.

1401
01:50:09,710 --> 01:50:12,290
If she had fought in the 51 kilos
she could've won a medal.

1402
01:50:13,120 --> 01:50:17,660
She should've won a medal
much earlier, in 55 kilos itself.

1403
01:50:18,120 --> 01:50:19,750
You are responsible for that!

1404
01:50:20,040 --> 01:50:21,000
What did I do wrong?

1405
01:50:21,210 --> 01:50:23,580
Geeta's natural game is attacking.

1406
01:50:24,370 --> 01:50:28,460
By putting technique above instinct,
you've changed her game.

1407
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:32,080
It's like telling a tiger
to fight like an elephant.

1408
01:50:33,580 --> 01:50:36,500
You'll be left with neither
a tiger nor an elephant.

1409
01:50:36,710 --> 01:50:37,960
So, why don't you tell me,

1410
01:50:38,210 --> 01:50:40,540
how to fight to win a medal!

1411
01:50:40,750 --> 01:50:44,910
With your permission, I would like to
demonstrate it here and now.

1412
01:50:45,290 --> 01:50:46,620
They're calling you inside.

1413
01:50:51,040 --> 01:50:52,410
What happened was wrong.

1414
01:50:52,660 --> 01:50:55,250
But the committee has decided
to give them another chance.

1415
01:50:55,460 --> 01:50:56,290
Thank you, sir.

1416
01:50:56,410 --> 01:50:58,710
But, from today,

1417
01:50:59,330 --> 01:51:01,620
neither are you allowed
to enter the NSA premises,

1418
01:51:02,080 --> 01:51:05,040
nor are they allowed
to step out.

1419
01:51:08,910 --> 01:51:09,870
Ok, sir.

1420
01:51:16,330 --> 01:51:18,830
Today, make one for me too, uncle.

1421
01:51:21,870 --> 01:51:22,870
Sorry.

1422
01:51:29,330 --> 01:51:30,330
Thank you.

1423
01:51:35,500 --> 01:51:37,210
We had come to play the lead role,

1424
01:51:37,290 --> 01:51:39,960
NSA made ours
a guest appearance.

1425
01:51:40,540 --> 01:51:42,290
Let's head back now.

1426
01:51:42,910 --> 01:51:44,330
No, Omkar.

1427
01:51:44,960 --> 01:51:47,660
They can stop me
from going inside,

1428
01:51:48,910 --> 01:51:52,250
but no one can stop me
from coaching Geeta.

1429
01:51:53,710 --> 01:51:54,710
Cheers, uncle.

1430
01:51:57,080 --> 01:51:59,000
Against three of them
I held my own.

1431
01:51:59,120 --> 01:52:01,370
But the one who
took me to the cleaners...

1432
01:52:01,540 --> 01:52:03,660
she was smaller than me
and not that strong either.

1433
01:52:03,750 --> 01:52:05,160
<i>But she beat me by nine points.</i>

1434
01:52:05,290 --> 01:52:07,000
Do you have a recording
of this match?

1435
01:52:07,160 --> 01:52:09,080
Yes papa, in the library.

1436
01:52:09,290 --> 01:52:11,460
Courier me a copy of all of them.

1437
01:52:18,080 --> 01:52:21,250
Only three months remain
for the Delhi Commonwealth Games.

1438
01:52:21,330 --> 01:52:25,540
And the fervor can be sensed at the
National Sports Academy in Patiala.

1439
01:52:28,080 --> 01:52:29,660
Where are we going, uncle?

1440
01:52:31,620 --> 01:52:34,460
<i>The one thing</i>
<i>I disliked about uncle,</i>

1441
01:52:34,830 --> 01:52:37,160
<i>was his constant</i>
<i>air of suspense.</i>

1442
01:52:37,330 --> 01:52:39,580
<i>It could kill you!</i>

1443
01:52:43,080 --> 01:52:45,250
"CrazyCougar.com"

1444
01:52:45,540 --> 01:52:47,370
"The Lustful Aunt."

1445
01:52:49,250 --> 01:52:52,080
If you want to watch a movie,
let's go to Amar Mahal.

1446
01:52:52,250 --> 01:52:53,870
They don't show decent films here.

1447
01:52:54,250 --> 01:52:55,370
Get off.

1448
01:52:58,040 --> 01:52:59,370
"Wild Daughter."

1449
01:53:00,410 --> 01:53:01,830
-Yes?
-How much for all the tickets

1450
01:53:01,910 --> 01:53:03,620
of the next show?

1451
01:53:04,460 --> 01:53:06,750
Which film do you
want to watch?

1452
01:53:07,160 --> 01:53:08,410
We've brought it with us.

1453
01:53:12,410 --> 01:53:13,620
Pause.

1454
01:53:17,910 --> 01:53:19,160
Play.

1455
01:53:32,500 --> 01:53:33,330
Are you done?

1456
01:53:33,410 --> 01:53:34,580
Be happy.

1457
01:53:34,660 --> 01:53:36,370
Your next show is sold-out too.

1458
01:53:36,580 --> 01:53:39,620
What are you guys up to?

1459
01:53:39,790 --> 01:53:41,910
I mean, where is the movie from?

1460
01:53:42,080 --> 01:53:45,160
Atlanta... Indonesia.

1461
01:53:45,250 --> 01:53:46,460
-Imported?
-Yes.

1462
01:53:46,540 --> 01:53:48,660
Listen, can I make a copy?

1463
01:53:48,750 --> 01:53:50,660
Give me 50 rupees less.

1464
01:53:55,290 --> 01:53:58,210
How will she win
if she fights like this?

1465
01:53:58,870 --> 01:54:00,160
Uncle!

1466
01:54:01,250 --> 01:54:05,250
Uncle, you've gathered
the knowledge,

1467
01:54:05,540 --> 01:54:07,160
but how will you pass it on?

1468
01:54:07,250 --> 01:54:10,120
NSA has issued a 'shoot-at-sight'
order against you.

1469
01:54:12,710 --> 01:54:13,790
Sit.

1470
01:54:14,750 --> 01:54:16,250
<i>Again... suspense!</i>

1471
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:18,620
Is this how you fight?

1472
01:54:18,710 --> 01:54:20,460
Like a quivering kitten?

1473
01:54:21,120 --> 01:54:23,160
If this is how you want to fight,
then don't.

1474
01:54:23,460 --> 01:54:24,500
What happened, papa?

1475
01:54:24,660 --> 01:54:26,870
I saw all your matches.

1476
01:54:27,500 --> 01:54:29,790
You weren't wrestling,
that's for sure!

1477
01:54:30,870 --> 01:54:33,830
Do you have copies of
the DVDs that you gave me?

1478
01:54:34,290 --> 01:54:35,160
Yes, papa.

1479
01:54:35,330 --> 01:54:37,750
Can you arrange to watch
them alone?

1480
01:54:38,040 --> 01:54:39,500
I'll borrow a laptop.

1481
01:54:40,210 --> 01:54:41,080
All right.

1482
01:54:41,250 --> 01:54:42,960
Be ready at 5 a.m. tomorrow.

1483
01:54:48,460 --> 01:54:50,370
It's been a while since
papa gave me an earful.

1484
01:54:52,160 --> 01:54:53,040
Felt good.

1485
01:54:55,160 --> 01:54:57,500
Play the Jakarta fight, round one.

1486
01:54:57,910 --> 01:54:58,910
I have, papa.

1487
01:54:59,120 --> 01:55:01,080
Go to three minutes 58 seconds.

1488
01:55:02,660 --> 01:55:04,620
You have a lead
of two points,

1489
01:55:04,710 --> 01:55:06,410
and you started
playing defensive.

1490
01:55:08,080 --> 01:55:09,540
Play. Look.

1491
01:55:12,160 --> 01:55:13,750
Threw away the lead, didn't you?

1492
01:55:15,660 --> 01:55:18,620
When the opponent is trailing,
go for the jugular!

1493
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:27,160
How did you do that?

1494
01:55:28,620 --> 01:55:32,210
Alternately, when you should be defending,
you are attacking and giving away points.

1495
01:55:32,580 --> 01:55:35,250
You will gain nothing by
desperately chasing after points.

1496
01:55:35,540 --> 01:55:37,660
You'll have to apply your mind.

1497
01:55:37,910 --> 01:55:39,830
You've lost matches
that were yours to win!

1498
01:55:48,460 --> 01:55:49,460
Go... Geeta!

1499
01:55:49,710 --> 01:55:52,370
National Trials, Patiala

1500
01:56:06,750 --> 01:56:09,540
Each round consists of two minutes.

1501
01:56:10,290 --> 01:56:15,080
However, there are 120 seconds
in those two minutes.

1502
01:56:15,460 --> 01:56:20,080
Wait for that one second
when the opponent makes a mistake.

1503
01:56:24,460 --> 01:56:26,500
She's good. Isn't she?

1504
01:56:27,500 --> 01:56:28,540
Yes, sir.

1505
01:56:30,120 --> 01:56:31,160
Very good!

1506
01:56:35,580 --> 01:56:37,870
Now you look ready, sis.

1507
01:56:38,960 --> 01:56:40,290
Did you tell papa?

1508
01:56:41,120 --> 01:56:42,040
What did he say?

1509
01:56:43,080 --> 01:56:45,290
"There's no need to get too happy!"

1510
01:56:51,830 --> 01:56:55,500
<i>A grand opening ceremony</i>
<i>to the 2010 Commonwealth Games!</i>

1511
01:56:57,790 --> 01:57:01,710
<i>Host nation, India, displaying</i>
<i>her ancient culture.</i>

1512
01:57:01,960 --> 01:57:04,580
<i>A proud moment indeed!</i>

1513
01:57:09,040 --> 01:57:12,080
<i>And here comes</i>
<i>the Indian contingent!</i>

1514
01:57:17,330 --> 01:57:20,710
<i>A huge welcome for them.</i>

1515
01:57:23,830 --> 01:57:27,160
<i>Let us remind you that</i>
<i>the finest athletes,</i>

1516
01:57:27,250 --> 01:57:30,000
<i>from 72 countries are participating.</i>

1517
01:57:30,580 --> 01:57:34,160
<i>We'll be back tomorrow</i>
<i>to start off the events.</i>

1518
01:57:34,540 --> 01:57:36,580
<i>Until then... goodnight!</i>

1519
01:57:42,370 --> 01:57:46,000
<i>Geeta was quite nervous</i>
<i>before her first bout.</i>

1520
01:57:46,460 --> 01:57:48,120
<i>And that was expected.</i>

1521
01:57:48,290 --> 01:57:52,620
<i>So far her performance</i>
<i>in international events had been poor.</i>

1522
01:57:53,410 --> 01:57:57,750
<i>However little... the nation</i>
<i>still had hopes for her.</i>

1523
01:57:58,830 --> 01:58:01,580
<i>And this was probably</i>
<i>Geeta's last opportunity,</i>

1524
01:58:01,660 --> 01:58:03,120
<i>to prove herself.</i>

1525
01:58:08,910 --> 01:58:12,120
<i>The first match in women's wrestling,</i>
<i>55 kilo category, is between,</i>

1526
01:58:12,290 --> 01:58:16,000
<i>India's Geeta Kumari and</i>
<i>Melissa Anderson from Wales.</i>

1527
01:58:16,410 --> 01:58:17,660
Go, Geeta!

1528
01:58:18,040 --> 01:58:19,870
<i>Geeta seems quite nervous.</i>

1529
01:58:20,040 --> 01:58:22,540
<i>Now, let's see if she can</i>
<i>break her jinx,</i>

1530
01:58:22,620 --> 01:58:26,500
<i>of losing in the first</i>
<i>couple of rounds.</i>

1531
01:58:27,160 --> 01:58:28,830
<i>We would like to remind</i>
<i>our spectators,</i>

1532
01:58:28,910 --> 01:58:31,250
<i>that there will be three rounds</i>
<i>of two minutes each.</i>

1533
01:58:32,040 --> 01:58:35,160
<i>Whoever wins two rounds,</i>
<i>wins the match.</i>

1534
01:58:38,160 --> 01:58:40,250
<i>With that the match begins.</i>

1535
01:58:42,460 --> 01:58:44,290
<i>Both the wrestlers are quite alert.</i>

1536
01:58:44,460 --> 01:58:46,210
<i>Neither of them wish to lose a point.</i>

1537
01:58:47,410 --> 01:58:48,710
<i>A great attack by Melissa.</i>

1538
01:58:48,910 --> 01:58:50,160
<i>Geeta is in trouble.</i>

1539
01:58:52,500 --> 01:58:54,040
<i>One point to Melissa.</i>

1540
01:58:54,120 --> 01:58:56,580
<i>Melissa - 1; Geeta - 0.</i>

1541
01:59:01,960 --> 01:59:04,710
<i>Melissa seems stronger.</i>

1542
01:59:06,460 --> 01:59:07,960
<i>Three more points to Melissa!</i>

1543
01:59:08,040 --> 01:59:09,210
What are you doing, Geeta?

1544
01:59:10,540 --> 01:59:12,370
<i>Melissa - 4; Geeta - 0.</i>

1545
01:59:12,460 --> 01:59:14,710
<i>If Geeta gives away</i>
<i>2 more points,</i>

1546
01:59:14,790 --> 01:59:18,040
<i>Melissa will win this round</i>
<i>on technical superiority.</i>

1547
01:59:21,040 --> 01:59:24,080
<i>Geeta, making an effort,</i>
<i>but Melissa still has the advantage.</i>

1548
01:59:24,250 --> 01:59:26,370
<i>And Melissa gets two points!</i>

1549
01:59:28,580 --> 01:59:30,660
<i>Exactly as we feared.</i>

1550
01:59:31,250 --> 01:59:36,080
<i>Melissa has won the first round</i>
<i>on technical superiority; 6-0.</i>

1551
01:59:37,080 --> 01:59:38,080
What are you doing, Geeta?

1552
01:59:38,710 --> 01:59:40,500
Don't lose so badly!

1553
01:59:41,290 --> 01:59:44,410
<i>We now need to see that</i>
<i>after losing the first round badly,</i>

1554
01:59:44,500 --> 01:59:47,370
<i>is Geeta capable of making</i>
<i>a comeback in round two.</i>

1555
01:59:52,620 --> 01:59:53,910
<i>Geeta with a good attack.</i>

1556
01:59:54,040 --> 01:59:55,370
<i>Melissa makes a counter-attack.</i>

1557
01:59:55,910 --> 01:59:57,710
<i>Two points to Melissa.</i>

1558
01:59:59,370 --> 02:00:01,080
<i>One more point to Melissa.</i>

1559
02:00:01,660 --> 02:00:05,250
<i>The match seems to be</i>
<i>slipping out of Geeta's hands.</i>

1560
02:00:06,750 --> 02:00:08,500
You are not to lose, Geeta!

1561
02:00:16,210 --> 02:00:17,620
Come on, Geeta.

1562
02:00:21,540 --> 02:00:23,210
<i>Geeta, lagging by three points.</i>

1563
02:00:23,620 --> 02:00:25,410
<i>She'll have to score real quick.</i>

1564
02:00:27,080 --> 02:00:28,660
<i>Geeta, making an effort.</i>

1565
02:00:28,870 --> 02:00:31,000
<i>But she got no points for that.</i>

1566
02:00:32,210 --> 02:00:33,750
<i>This is a good opportunity.</i>

1567
02:00:34,040 --> 02:00:35,830
<i>Two points to Geeta!</i>

1568
02:00:36,410 --> 02:00:39,000
<i>Melissa - 3; Geeta - 2.</i>

1569
02:00:39,460 --> 02:00:41,580
<i>Geeta tries to score some more,</i>

1570
02:00:42,160 --> 02:00:43,710
<i>but the referee blows the whistle.</i>

1571
02:00:44,210 --> 02:00:46,120
<i>The round is nearing completion.</i>

1572
02:00:46,210 --> 02:00:48,250
<i>Geeta is still behind by a point.</i>

1573
02:00:49,620 --> 02:00:50,710
<i>Come on, Geeta.</i>

1574
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:54,290
<i>It looks as though Geeta is about to be</i>
<i>disqualified in the first round. </i>

1575
02:00:55,250 --> 02:00:58,000
<i>Geeta in trouble!</i>

1576
02:01:00,790 --> 02:01:02,710
<i>Geeta gets three points!</i>

1577
02:01:02,960 --> 02:01:05,370
<i>Geeta - 5; Melissa - 3.</i>

1578
02:01:06,370 --> 02:01:10,830
<i>Just four seconds to go.</i>

1579
02:01:12,250 --> 02:01:13,500
Yes, Geeta!

1580
02:01:16,540 --> 02:01:19,040
<i>Geeta's back in the match!</i>

1581
02:01:19,120 --> 02:01:21,250
<i>It's one round each.</i>

1582
02:01:21,460 --> 02:01:26,750
<i>Geeta has shown that she is not</i>
<i>going to accept defeat so easily.</i>

1583
02:01:27,250 --> 02:01:30,080
It's the last round.

1584
02:01:30,540 --> 02:01:32,330
Play defensive.

1585
02:01:34,620 --> 02:01:35,660
Got it?

1586
02:01:36,120 --> 02:01:37,580
Play attacking!

1587
02:01:46,330 --> 02:01:47,870
<i>And the last round begins.</i>

1588
02:01:48,960 --> 02:01:50,830
<i>Geeta on the attack.</i>

1589
02:01:54,370 --> 02:01:55,790
<i>One point for Geeta.</i>

1590
02:01:56,250 --> 02:01:58,750
<i>Geeta - 1; Melissa - 0.</i>

1591
02:02:01,210 --> 02:02:03,120
<i>Geeta has the stronger offense.</i>

1592
02:02:03,790 --> 02:02:06,410
<i>Geeta makes an attack, but can't score.</i>

1593
02:02:06,870 --> 02:02:08,120
<i>Another attack.</i>

1594
02:02:08,250 --> 02:02:10,040
<i>Two more points in Geeta's kitty.</i>

1595
02:02:10,410 --> 02:02:12,660
<i>Geeta- 3; Melissa - 0.</i>

1596
02:02:13,290 --> 02:02:16,120
<i>Will she manage to keep her lead?</i>

1597
02:02:17,580 --> 02:02:19,080
Very good. Defend now.

1598
02:02:20,710 --> 02:02:22,040
<i>Geeta is still on the attack.</i>

1599
02:02:22,120 --> 02:02:24,660
<i>Geeta makes an attack, Melissa counters.</i>

1600
02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:26,370
<i>Geeta is in a tight spot.</i>

1601
02:02:27,660 --> 02:02:29,290
<i>Three points for Melissa!</i>

1602
02:02:29,460 --> 02:02:30,750
I told you to defend.

1603
02:02:30,910 --> 02:02:32,750
No problem.
Keep attacking!

1604
02:02:32,830 --> 02:02:34,750
<i>The score is equal at 3-3.</i>

1605
02:02:37,210 --> 02:02:39,210
Go for it, Geeta!

1606
02:02:39,660 --> 02:02:42,000
<i>This match can tilt either way.</i>

1607
02:02:42,370 --> 02:02:46,750
<i>Geeta was poised to win</i>
<i>but lost her lead.</i>

1608
02:02:46,830 --> 02:02:49,250
<i>Both the wrestlers on edge.</i>

1609
02:02:49,620 --> 02:02:51,290
<i>Geeta's in danger.</i>

1610
02:02:51,460 --> 02:02:53,460
-Counter-attack.
-Wow! What a move!

1611
02:02:53,540 --> 02:02:54,870
<i>Three points to Geeta!</i>

1612
02:02:54,960 --> 02:02:56,540
Keep her down, Geeta.

1613
02:02:56,620 --> 02:02:58,660
Just a few more seconds
for the match to end.

1614
02:02:58,750 --> 02:03:01,290
Can Geeta keep her there?

1615
02:03:02,580 --> 02:03:06,080
<i>Geeta has won this match!</i>

1616
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:11,120
<i>India's Geeta Kumari Phogat,</i>

1617
02:03:11,210 --> 02:03:17,000
<i>has proven her critics wrong.</i>

1618
02:03:18,660 --> 02:03:24,540
<i>A proud moment for Geeta's father,</i>
<i>Mahavir Singh Phogat!</i>

1619
02:03:24,830 --> 02:03:30,580
<i>And a proud moment for the country.</i>

1620
02:03:33,830 --> 02:03:35,290
So far India has won,

1621
02:03:35,370 --> 02:03:38,750
five gold, 13 silver
and seven bronze medals.

1622
02:03:39,210 --> 02:03:41,540
In women's wrestling,
India's Geeta Kumari Phogat,

1623
02:03:41,710 --> 02:03:45,330
has entered the semi-finals
of the 55 kilo category.

1624
02:03:45,660 --> 02:03:50,040
<i>Geeta will now face</i>
<i>Nigeria's Naomi Edwards,</i>

1625
02:03:50,120 --> 02:03:52,120
<i>two time world champion.</i>

1626
02:03:52,750 --> 02:03:53,620
What do you think?

1627
02:03:53,710 --> 02:03:56,250
Naomi is a very strong wrestler.

1628
02:03:56,330 --> 02:03:58,710
<i>Extremely aggressive and attacking.</i>

1629
02:03:59,250 --> 02:04:04,000
<i>She doesn't give any</i>
<i>opportunity to her opponent.</i>

1630
02:04:08,290 --> 02:04:11,750
<i>It's not going to be easy</i>
<i>for Geeta this time.</i>

1631
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,080
Today, you played as per your will.

1632
02:04:19,250 --> 02:04:21,660
Now, do as I say.

1633
02:04:22,210 --> 02:04:23,910
Or it's impossible to win.

1634
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,500
It's a difficult one,

1635
02:04:26,870 --> 02:04:28,330
but not impossible.

1636
02:04:29,500 --> 02:04:32,040
You'll have to play offensive!

1637
02:04:32,160 --> 02:04:34,000
You have to play defensive.

1638
02:04:34,080 --> 02:04:35,660
Just go for the points!

1639
02:04:35,750 --> 02:04:38,120
Don't go for the points.

1640
02:04:38,210 --> 02:04:40,120
You'll get a lot of opportunities.

1641
02:04:40,210 --> 02:04:43,660
Don't give her any opportunities
because she won't give you any.

1642
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,160
Force a lock-jam each time.

1643
02:04:46,960 --> 02:04:49,250
If she doesn't get to score,
she'll get frustrated,

1644
02:04:49,580 --> 02:04:50,910
and will give you an opportunity.

1645
02:04:51,080 --> 02:04:54,000
That's the moment
we should grab!

1646
02:04:55,120 --> 02:04:58,410
<i>The first semi-final match in</i>
<i>the 55 kilo category.</i>

1647
02:04:58,620 --> 02:05:02,660
<i>India's Geeta Kumari</i>
<i>versus Nigeria's Naomi Edwards.</i>

1648
02:05:06,580 --> 02:05:08,960
<i>Naomi attacking from the start.</i>

1649
02:05:09,870 --> 02:05:12,710
<i>And against her nature,</i>
<i>Geeta playing defensive.</i>

1650
02:05:14,330 --> 02:05:15,960
<i>Naomi attacks!</i>

1651
02:05:16,040 --> 02:05:17,960
<i>Geeta in trouble.</i>

1652
02:05:18,040 --> 02:05:20,910
<i>Geeta putting up a strong defense.</i>
<i>Naomi trying to break free.</i>

1653
02:05:21,210 --> 02:05:23,210
<i>Geeta holding her back.</i>

1654
02:05:28,620 --> 02:05:30,620
<i>Naomi made a strong attempt.</i>

1655
02:05:30,910 --> 02:05:32,910
<i>But Geeta held her own.</i>

1656
02:05:33,620 --> 02:05:34,870
Go on the attack!

1657
02:05:35,580 --> 02:05:36,540
Go easy.

1658
02:05:36,830 --> 02:05:38,160
<i>The game resumes.</i>

1659
02:05:38,370 --> 02:05:39,750
<i>Naomi gets rough.</i>

1660
02:05:40,160 --> 02:05:41,910
<i>She seems frustrated.</i>

1661
02:05:43,370 --> 02:05:45,790
<i>Naomi twisting Geeta's wrist.</i>

1662
02:05:45,870 --> 02:05:47,330
<i>The referee issues a warning.</i>

1663
02:05:48,910 --> 02:05:50,960
<i>The referee has stopped the match.</i>

1664
02:05:51,790 --> 02:05:56,000
<i>Naomi is being given a warning.</i>

1665
02:05:56,080 --> 02:05:57,790
Hang in there, Geeta!

1666
02:05:59,710 --> 02:06:01,330
<i>And the game is resumed.</i>

1667
02:06:02,750 --> 02:06:04,250
<i>Geeta is still playing it safe.</i>

1668
02:06:04,500 --> 02:06:06,710
<i>Naomi is looking for an</i>
<i>opportunity to attack.</i>

1669
02:06:07,830 --> 02:06:09,410
<i>And she attacks!</i>

1670
02:06:10,040 --> 02:06:11,660
<i>That's three points for Naomi!</i>

1671
02:06:12,620 --> 02:06:14,830
<i>Geeta had been</i>
<i>holding her off well.</i>

1672
02:06:14,910 --> 02:06:16,040
<i>A really good effort,</i>

1673
02:06:16,120 --> 02:06:18,040
<i>but Naomi's broken</i>
<i>through her defense.</i>

1674
02:06:18,160 --> 02:06:20,210
<i>Naomi in the lead.</i>

1675
02:06:20,370 --> 02:06:22,910
<i>Geeta has to act fast.</i>

1676
02:06:23,080 --> 02:06:25,410
<i>Naomi is still on the attack.</i>

1677
02:06:25,540 --> 02:06:28,250
<i>Geeta, looking for an</i>
<i>opening while defending.</i>

1678
02:06:29,580 --> 02:06:31,080
<i>Geeta takes Naomi down.</i>

1679
02:06:31,160 --> 02:06:32,210
<i>One point to Geeta!</i>

1680
02:06:32,290 --> 02:06:33,540
<i>She's still trying.</i>

1681
02:06:33,660 --> 02:06:35,540
<i>Naomi is in trouble.</i>

1682
02:06:35,750 --> 02:06:38,460
<i>Can Geeta score two more points?</i>

1683
02:06:39,910 --> 02:06:41,540
<i>And time's up!</i>

1684
02:06:41,870 --> 02:06:45,210
<i>Geeta played well,</i>
<i>but she's lost this first round.</i>

1685
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:47,040
What are you doing, Geeta?

1686
02:06:47,500 --> 02:06:48,870
Why don't you attack?

1687
02:06:56,080 --> 02:06:58,370
<i>The second round begins.</i>

1688
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:04,500
<i>Naomi on the offense.</i>

1689
02:07:04,660 --> 02:07:07,410
<i>She has no openings.</i>

1690
02:07:07,500 --> 02:07:08,580
<i>And Geeta defends!</i>

1691
02:07:10,330 --> 02:07:12,460
<i>Naomi is still looking for an opportunity.</i>

1692
02:07:12,540 --> 02:07:13,620
<i>Geeta attacks!</i>

1693
02:07:13,910 --> 02:07:16,460
<i>Naomi defends. Counter-attack!</i>

1694
02:07:17,370 --> 02:07:19,370
<i>This match is heating up.</i>

1695
02:07:19,500 --> 02:07:21,960
<i>Both fighters are testing each other.</i>

1696
02:07:24,160 --> 02:07:26,040
<i>Naomi tries to flip Geeta.</i>

1697
02:07:26,120 --> 02:07:28,580
<i>But Geeta defends well.</i>

1698
02:07:29,210 --> 02:07:31,830
<i>They're locked in a stalemate.</i>

1699
02:07:32,290 --> 02:07:34,000
<i>Naomi puts all her strength,</i>

1700
02:07:34,330 --> 02:07:37,160
<i>but Geeta isn't giving her a chance.</i>

1701
02:07:38,040 --> 02:07:40,410
<i>This is an exciting match.</i>

1702
02:07:41,830 --> 02:07:44,040
<i>Naomi trying hard,</i>

1703
02:07:44,410 --> 02:07:46,710
<i>but Geeta not giving her space.</i>

1704
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,410
<i>Naomi attacks again.</i>

1705
02:07:50,830 --> 02:07:52,370
<i>Geeta defends.</i>

1706
02:07:52,460 --> 02:07:54,290
<i>Naomi trying to make it work.</i>

1707
02:07:54,370 --> 02:07:56,000
<i>Geeta won't let her succeed.</i>

1708
02:07:56,460 --> 02:07:59,910
<i>Geeta has nullified all the</i>
<i>attacks coming her way.</i>

1709
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,120
<i>A nice defense by Geeta.</i>

1710
02:08:02,330 --> 02:08:04,410
<i>Naomi makes another explosive attack.</i>

1711
02:08:04,790 --> 02:08:07,040
<i>Geeta has her trapped.</i>

1712
02:08:08,040 --> 02:08:10,460
<i>Naomi is trying her hardest to break free.</i>

1713
02:08:11,370 --> 02:08:14,660
<i>Geeta keeping on the pressure.</i>

1714
02:08:15,500 --> 02:08:17,500
<i>The referee breaks the fight.</i>

1715
02:08:17,580 --> 02:08:19,910
<i>Second round is still 0-0.</i>

1716
02:08:20,620 --> 02:08:26,250
<i>Naomi must be wondering</i>
<i>how to break Geeta's defense.</i>

1717
02:08:28,120 --> 02:08:29,830
<i>Naomi pushes her away.</i>

1718
02:08:29,910 --> 02:08:32,750
<i>"If she doesn't get to score,</i>
<i>she'll get frustrated,</i>

1719
02:08:33,040 --> 02:08:33,960
<i>and will give you an opportunity."</i>

1720
02:08:34,210 --> 02:08:36,410
<i>Naomi attacks. Geeta is in trouble.</i>

1721
02:08:36,910 --> 02:08:38,960
<i>"That's the moment</i>
<i>we should grab!"</i>

1722
02:08:39,210 --> 02:08:40,830
<i>Geeta makes a counter-attack.</i>

1723
02:08:42,460 --> 02:08:44,290
<i>Three points!</i>

1724
02:08:44,660 --> 02:08:48,460
<i>And Geeta wins this round, 3-0.</i>

1725
02:08:50,910 --> 02:08:52,160
Naomi, look at me.

1726
02:08:52,790 --> 02:08:53,790
That girl, she's smart.

1727
02:08:53,870 --> 02:08:54,960
But you are double smart.

1728
02:08:55,330 --> 02:08:56,160
Ok?

1729
02:08:56,330 --> 02:08:58,080
Don't allow her to turn you easily.

1730
02:08:58,250 --> 02:08:59,330
How are you fighting?

1731
02:08:59,620 --> 02:09:03,160
Sir, I am fighting as I have learnt.

1732
02:09:05,870 --> 02:09:07,960
<i>The third and final round has started.</i>

1733
02:09:08,040 --> 02:09:10,120
<i>Both wrestlers are on their toes.</i>

1734
02:09:10,290 --> 02:09:11,500
<i>It's interesting to see,</i>

1735
02:09:11,580 --> 02:09:14,910
<i>that Naomi is now playing cautiously.</i>
<i>Unlike her nature.</i>

1736
02:09:15,580 --> 02:09:17,120
<i>And Naomi attacks!</i>

1737
02:09:17,370 --> 02:09:20,080
<i>Geeta is in trouble.</i>

1738
02:09:22,500 --> 02:09:26,790
<i>Geeta defends beautifully.</i>

1739
02:09:28,540 --> 02:09:30,660
<i>Naomi is on the attack again.</i>

1740
02:09:31,620 --> 02:09:33,330
<i>Geeta defends.</i>

1741
02:09:33,660 --> 02:09:35,830
<i>Naomi trying real hard.</i>

1742
02:09:36,080 --> 02:09:38,160
<i>But Geeta holding her back.</i>

1743
02:09:38,830 --> 02:09:40,540
<i>It's a lock position again.</i>

1744
02:09:40,620 --> 02:09:41,620
<i>The referee has blown the whistle.</i>

1745
02:09:41,790 --> 02:09:44,750
<i>The wrestlers will have to return</i>
<i>to their initial positions.</i>

1746
02:09:45,330 --> 02:09:47,370
<i>And it begins.</i>

1747
02:09:47,870 --> 02:09:49,080
<i>Naomi attacks again.</i>

1748
02:09:49,580 --> 02:09:51,210
<i>Geeta holds her back.</i>

1749
02:09:51,410 --> 02:09:53,370
<i>Naomi is giving it her all.</i>

1750
02:09:53,870 --> 02:09:55,830
<i>Will Naomi score?</i>

1751
02:09:57,080 --> 02:09:59,080
Hold on, Geeta!

1752
02:09:59,410 --> 02:10:02,410
<i>Geeta is holding Naomi at bay.</i>

1753
02:10:02,790 --> 02:10:04,620
<i>And the referee has</i>
<i>blown his whistle again.</i>

1754
02:10:05,040 --> 02:10:07,710
<i>The score stands at 0-0.</i>

1755
02:10:08,080 --> 02:10:11,040
<i>Naomi tries harder. And she attacks!</i>

1756
02:10:12,750 --> 02:10:15,500
<i>Geeta is exposed here</i>
<i>but holds her back.</i>

1757
02:10:16,040 --> 02:10:19,910
<i>Naomi tries to score,</i>
<i>but Geeta refuses to budge.</i>

1758
02:10:25,500 --> 02:10:29,750
<i>Naomi has had no openings to</i>
<i>exploit in this match.</i>

1759
02:10:30,460 --> 02:10:32,790
<i>Geeta hanging on</i>
<i>by the skin of her teeth.</i>

1760
02:10:32,960 --> 02:10:35,330
<i>Only 12 seconds left.</i>

1761
02:10:36,120 --> 02:10:38,290
<i>The score still 0-0.</i>

1762
02:10:38,460 --> 02:10:39,790
<i>Let's see who scores first.</i>

1763
02:10:39,960 --> 02:10:41,410
<i>Geeta attacks!</i>

1764
02:10:41,660 --> 02:10:43,870
<i>Naomi is in trouble.</i>
<i>Oh, beautiful defense!</i>

1765
02:10:44,160 --> 02:10:46,250
<i>Geeta is still trying to score.</i>

1766
02:10:48,710 --> 02:10:52,790
<i>With that, this round is tied at 0-0. </i>

1767
02:10:53,160 --> 02:10:54,910
She could have scored.

1768
02:10:55,460 --> 02:10:56,710
Now there'll be a toss.

1769
02:10:57,080 --> 02:10:59,250
<i>Now there will be a toss. </i>

1770
02:10:59,500 --> 02:11:02,040
<i>This is known as a 'clinch.'</i>

1771
02:11:02,500 --> 02:11:06,620
<i>The wrestler who wins the toss</i>
<i>gets to choose a grip,</i>

1772
02:11:07,210 --> 02:11:10,370
<i>and gets 30 seconds to score.</i>

1773
02:11:11,080 --> 02:11:13,870
<i>If the red side falls up,</i>
<i>Naomi gets to attack,</i>

1774
02:11:14,210 --> 02:11:16,830
<i>if it's blue, Geeta gets to attack.</i>

1775
02:11:17,160 --> 02:11:19,750
<i>In 99 percent of the cases</i>
<i>the one who wins the toss,</i>

1776
02:11:19,830 --> 02:11:21,290
<i>wins the match.</i>

1777
02:11:34,210 --> 02:11:35,540
<i>Oh!</i>

1778
02:11:35,620 --> 02:11:38,960
<i>Maybe even destiny</i>
<i>doesn't want Geeta to win.</i>

1779
02:11:40,500 --> 02:11:44,000
<i>It's next to impossible to defend</i>
<i>against Naomi for 30 seconds.</i>

1780
02:11:46,210 --> 02:11:47,870
<i>-Which leg do you choose?</i>
<i>-Right.</i>

1781
02:11:48,080 --> 02:11:50,790
<i>Naomi has chosen</i>
<i>Geeta's right leg.</i>

1782
02:11:51,460 --> 02:11:53,790
<i>Geeta takes a defensive position.</i>

1783
02:11:54,870 --> 02:11:57,250
<i>Naomi takes her grip of choice.</i>

1784
02:11:58,250 --> 02:11:59,790
<i>Now, Geeta has two options.</i>

1785
02:12:00,660 --> 02:12:02,750
<i>Not allow Naomi to score</i>
<i>for 30 seconds,</i>

1786
02:12:02,830 --> 02:12:05,160
<i>or score herself,</i>
<i>and win the match.</i>

1787
02:12:06,290 --> 02:12:10,710
<i>In this position against Naomi,</i>
<i>both are almost impossible.</i>

1788
02:12:21,580 --> 02:12:23,120
<i>And it begins.</i>

1789
02:12:23,330 --> 02:12:26,620
<i>Naomi is trying to get her opponent on her</i>
<i>back. Geeta won't let that happen.</i>

1790
02:12:26,830 --> 02:12:29,250
<i>She lifts Geeta! Geeta is in trouble.</i>

1791
02:12:30,910 --> 02:12:33,460
<i>Geeta defends. Counter-attack!</i>

1792
02:12:33,540 --> 02:12:36,460
<i>And Geeta scores a point!</i>

1793
02:12:41,750 --> 02:12:45,290
<i>No one expected</i>
<i>Geeta to win this match.</i>

1794
02:12:46,080 --> 02:12:50,710
<i>She has beaten the number one</i>
<i>contender for gold,</i>

1795
02:12:50,790 --> 02:12:53,870
<i>in this very exciting clinch,</i>

1796
02:12:53,960 --> 02:12:56,960
<i>and entered the finals!</i>

1797
02:12:57,790 --> 02:13:00,750
<i>And let's hope that</i>
<i>Geeta Phogat,</i>

1798
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:04,410
<i>maintains her wonderful form</i>
<i>in the finals too.</i>

1799
02:13:24,120 --> 02:13:25,620
Shall we go, uncle?

1800
02:13:25,960 --> 02:13:27,620
Let's see the next match.

1801
02:13:27,960 --> 02:13:30,620
Let's find out whether Geeta's finals
is against the Australian,

1802
02:13:30,830 --> 02:13:32,040
or the Scottish wrestler.

1803
02:13:32,660 --> 02:13:34,370
I am very proud of Geeta.

1804
02:13:34,870 --> 02:13:37,870
She followed my strategy to the T.

1805
02:13:38,250 --> 02:13:40,040
The result is in front of you.

1806
02:13:40,960 --> 02:13:42,410
Here she comes.

1807
02:13:44,620 --> 02:13:46,290
She looks good.

1808
02:13:47,620 --> 02:13:49,250
I mean... as a wrestler.

1809
02:13:51,120 --> 02:13:54,460
Uncle, isn't she the
same one from the DVD?

1810
02:13:56,290 --> 02:13:57,750
Angelina Watson.

1811
02:13:58,210 --> 02:14:00,160
She's defeated Geeta twice.

1812
02:14:01,910 --> 02:14:04,040
She's played well till now.

1813
02:14:04,710 --> 02:14:06,460
And she'll play well
in the finals too.

1814
02:14:11,540 --> 02:14:14,620
I've always had faith in Geeta.

1815
02:14:15,040 --> 02:14:18,500
Sooner or later she had to
win an international medal.

1816
02:14:23,500 --> 02:14:25,250
A silver is guaranteed now!

1817
02:14:31,790 --> 02:14:33,290
The final won't be so easy.

1818
02:14:34,160 --> 02:14:35,040
Geetaji,

1819
02:14:35,540 --> 02:14:37,330
your game has changed dramatically.

1820
02:14:37,540 --> 02:14:38,830
How did this happen?

1821
02:14:44,120 --> 02:14:47,120
The entire credit for this,

1822
02:14:47,370 --> 02:14:48,790
goes to my father.

1823
02:14:52,370 --> 02:14:55,080
He never stopped believing in me.

1824
02:15:04,620 --> 02:15:05,500
Mahavirji!

1825
02:15:06,500 --> 02:15:08,000
Hello, Mr. Shamim.

1826
02:15:08,120 --> 02:15:09,790
Congratulations, Mahavirji!

1827
02:15:09,870 --> 02:15:11,460
Geeta fought very well.

1828
02:15:11,580 --> 02:15:14,120
All of Balali is proud.

1829
02:15:14,330 --> 02:15:15,710
And these girls insisted,

1830
02:15:15,790 --> 02:15:18,000
on watching Geeta's match
in the stadium,

1831
02:15:18,080 --> 02:15:19,290
or they won't eat.

1832
02:15:21,660 --> 02:15:22,750
How did you like the match?

1833
02:15:22,830 --> 02:15:24,000
Loved it!

1834
02:15:24,080 --> 02:15:26,160
Give this to her.

1835
02:15:27,580 --> 02:15:28,410
What is this?

1836
02:15:28,540 --> 02:15:29,620
I prayed for her.

1837
02:15:29,790 --> 02:15:31,500
Tomorrow is the final.

1838
02:15:34,660 --> 02:15:35,500
Bless you!

1839
02:15:35,830 --> 02:15:37,460
How can we allow this, sir?

1840
02:15:37,960 --> 02:15:40,540
Mahavir Singh is shouting instructions
to Geeta from the audience.

1841
02:15:40,830 --> 02:15:43,460
The poor thing is getting confused
whether to listen to him or me.

1842
02:15:45,620 --> 02:15:48,790
From her game, it sure doesn't
seem like she's confused.

1843
02:15:50,790 --> 02:15:54,040
Besides, how can we ask
the audience to remain silent?

1844
02:15:55,040 --> 02:15:56,080
Aren't you the coach?

1845
02:15:57,620 --> 02:15:59,120
She should be listening to you.

1846
02:15:59,460 --> 02:16:01,460
No, sir... she is listening to me.

1847
02:16:02,160 --> 02:16:04,460
-That's why she's winning.
-Then what's the problem?

1848
02:16:06,910 --> 02:16:08,620
You wanted a bronze, right?

1849
02:16:10,120 --> 02:16:13,160
It's quite possible that
tomorrow she may win gold.

1850
02:16:14,250 --> 02:16:15,080
No?

1851
02:16:17,120 --> 02:16:21,410
I am surprised she's made it so far
but I am happy for her.

1852
02:16:21,750 --> 02:16:24,290
It should be an interesting
final tomorrow.

1853
02:16:24,370 --> 02:16:27,370
Playing an Indian
in front of an Indian crowd.

1854
02:16:27,710 --> 02:16:29,370
Beating her, of course!

1855
02:16:29,500 --> 02:16:32,040
Angelina, any pressure
before the finals?

1856
02:16:32,160 --> 02:16:35,910
Yeah, I am sure she must be
under tremendous pressure.

1857
02:16:36,710 --> 02:16:38,370
I've beaten her twice.

1858
02:16:38,660 --> 02:16:39,790
-First round?
-Yeah.

1859
02:16:39,870 --> 02:16:41,370
Yeah, first round.

1860
02:16:42,040 --> 02:16:44,000
So, thank you and,

1861
02:16:44,080 --> 02:16:45,160
Namaste!

1862
02:16:51,160 --> 02:16:53,120
What's the strategy
for tomorrow, papa?

1863
02:17:01,120 --> 02:17:04,040
There is only one strategy
for tomorrow, child.

1864
02:17:05,160 --> 02:17:09,000
You have to fight in a way
that people remember you.

1865
02:17:12,250 --> 02:17:13,960
If you win silver,

1866
02:17:14,540 --> 02:17:17,160
sooner or later
you'll be forgotten.

1867
02:17:19,040 --> 02:17:23,000
If you win gold,
you will become an example.

1868
02:17:24,710 --> 02:17:28,580
And examples are given, child...
not forgotten.

1869
02:17:33,830 --> 02:17:35,910
See those girls?

1870
02:17:37,870 --> 02:17:40,410
If you win tomorrow,
you will not win alone.

1871
02:17:41,160 --> 02:17:44,830
Millions of girls like them
will win along with you.

1872
02:17:47,410 --> 02:17:51,710
It'll be a victory for every girl who
is considered inferior to boys;

1873
02:17:52,250 --> 02:17:54,580
who is forced
into household chores,

1874
02:17:54,870 --> 02:17:57,790
who is married off
to just raise children.

1875
02:18:00,410 --> 02:18:04,080
Tomorrow's match is
the most important one.

1876
02:18:06,750 --> 02:18:09,910
Because tomorrow you won't be
fighting just that Australian

1877
02:18:10,290 --> 02:18:14,830
but all those people
who think less of girls.

1878
02:18:22,620 --> 02:18:25,410
<i>The finals of the women's wrestling,</i>
<i>Commonwealth Games 2010,</i>

1879
02:18:25,660 --> 02:18:28,500
<i>55 kilo category, is about to begin.</i>

1880
02:18:28,830 --> 02:18:33,540
<i>India's Geeta Kumari versus</i>
<i>Australia's Angelina Watson.</i>

1881
02:18:34,620 --> 02:18:37,040
<i>We'd like to remind you all,</i>

1882
02:18:37,120 --> 02:18:40,660
<i>that never before has</i>
<i>an Indian female wrestler,</i>

1883
02:18:41,210 --> 02:18:44,210
<i>ever won gold in the</i>
<i>Commonwealth Games.</i>

1884
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:47,210
<i>In this crowd, we see,</i>

1885
02:18:47,830 --> 02:18:51,410
<i>a lot of hope, enthusiasm</i>
<i>and the Indian flag.</i>

1886
02:19:08,790 --> 02:19:10,120
Hello, sir!

1887
02:19:10,210 --> 02:19:11,790
Aren't you Mahavir Singhji?

1888
02:19:11,870 --> 02:19:13,290
-Geeta's father?
-Yes.

1889
02:19:13,370 --> 02:19:14,330
A moment please.

1890
02:19:14,580 --> 02:19:18,120
The chairman of the Wrestling
Federation wants to meet you.

1891
02:19:18,210 --> 02:19:19,580
Some important matter.

1892
02:19:20,370 --> 02:19:22,870
I'll meet him later.
It's my daughter's match.

1893
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:25,210
He's a big man.
He might get offended.

1894
02:19:25,290 --> 02:19:27,580
Just two minutes.

1895
02:19:31,080 --> 02:19:32,410
You carry on. I'll be there.

1896
02:19:37,960 --> 02:19:40,910
"The entire credit for this
goes to my father."

1897
02:19:41,790 --> 02:19:43,710
Go... take the credit.

1898
02:19:54,410 --> 02:19:55,710
How much further is it?

1899
02:19:55,870 --> 02:19:57,210
We are almost there, sir.

1900
02:20:05,080 --> 02:20:06,410
Where have you got me?

1901
02:20:07,870 --> 02:20:09,960
Hey, brother!

1902
02:20:10,250 --> 02:20:12,540
What are you doing, brother?

1903
02:20:14,710 --> 02:20:19,210
<i>A thunderous applause for Geeta</i>
<i>as she walks in.</i>

1904
02:20:20,040 --> 02:20:21,580
Is anyone there?

1905
02:20:24,120 --> 02:20:25,290
Hello!

1906
02:20:26,040 --> 02:20:27,620
Anyone there?

1907
02:20:28,290 --> 02:20:29,750
This is the final.

1908
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:31,330
Play carefully.

1909
02:21:01,960 --> 02:21:05,790
<i>Angelina Watson enters the stadium.</i>

1910
02:21:16,960 --> 02:21:20,330
<i>And the final match begins.</i>

1911
02:21:20,410 --> 02:21:22,160
Go for gold, Geeta!

1912
02:21:26,120 --> 02:21:27,330
<i>The match begins.</i>

1913
02:21:28,370 --> 02:21:31,620
<i>Angelina, aggressive</i>
<i>from the start.</i>

1914
02:21:32,370 --> 02:21:33,910
<i>She attacks.</i>

1915
02:21:36,080 --> 02:21:37,290
<i>She tries to defend...</i>

1916
02:21:37,830 --> 02:21:38,960
<i>and succeeds.</i>

1917
02:21:39,250 --> 02:21:40,790
<i>Angelina is still attacking.</i>

1918
02:21:41,460 --> 02:21:43,620
<i>Angelina attacks! Geeta counters!</i>

1919
02:21:43,710 --> 02:21:45,790
<i>And three points for Geeta!</i>

1920
02:21:46,040 --> 02:21:49,290
<i>Geeta takes a big lead</i>
<i>right from the start.</i>

1921
02:21:49,790 --> 02:21:52,620
<i>Geeta - 3; Angelina - 0.</i>

1922
02:21:53,290 --> 02:21:54,120
Good... good!

1923
02:22:03,660 --> 02:22:05,540
<i>Angelina is going for it.</i>

1924
02:22:06,040 --> 02:22:09,120
<i>She attacks. Geeta defends!</i>
<i>Counter-attack!</i>

1925
02:22:09,580 --> 02:22:11,370
<i>Another point for Geeta.</i>

1926
02:22:12,620 --> 02:22:15,910
<i>Geeta - 4; Angelina - 0.</i>

1927
02:22:16,460 --> 02:22:18,830
<i>Geeta playing very well.</i>

1928
02:22:26,080 --> 02:22:27,960
<i>Angelina will need to act fast.</i>

1929
02:22:28,160 --> 02:22:29,540
<i>Geeta has a four point lead.</i>

1930
02:22:29,750 --> 02:22:32,290
<i>Angelina attacks, but Geeta</i>
<i>has it under control.</i>

1931
02:22:33,540 --> 02:22:35,540
<i>Geeta attacks!</i>

1932
02:22:35,960 --> 02:22:37,540
<i>Angelina counter-attacks!</i>

1933
02:22:37,870 --> 02:22:39,750
<i>A point to Angelina.</i>

1934
02:22:41,120 --> 02:22:45,370
<i>Angelina looks for a takedown.</i>
<i>Trying to score.</i>

1935
02:22:45,910 --> 02:22:47,620
<i>Geeta defends well.</i>

1936
02:22:48,080 --> 02:22:49,460
<i>Referee whistles.</i>

1937
02:22:49,580 --> 02:22:52,370
<i>Geeta leads, 4-1.</i>

1938
02:22:52,620 --> 02:22:54,160
<i>Angelina needs to catch up.</i>

1939
02:22:54,540 --> 02:22:57,540
<i>Angelina attacks. Geeta counters.</i>

1940
02:22:57,830 --> 02:23:02,250
<i>A point to Geeta.</i>
<i>Geeta- 5; Angelina -1.</i>

1941
02:23:02,790 --> 02:23:06,460
<i>And with this, Geeta Kumari</i>
<i>wins the first round quite easily.</i>

1942
02:23:06,540 --> 02:23:09,000
<i>Perhaps Angelina is realizing,</i>

1943
02:23:09,460 --> 02:23:10,910
<i>that this is not the same Geeta,</i>

1944
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:13,250
<i>whom she had defeated</i>
<i>easily in the past.</i>

1945
02:23:43,040 --> 02:23:44,790
<i>And the second round starts.</i>

1946
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:47,750
<i>Will Geeta win this round</i>
<i>and create history?</i>

1947
02:23:48,910 --> 02:23:50,750
<i>Angelina is playing aggressive.</i>

1948
02:23:52,460 --> 02:23:54,370
<i>An excellent takedown!</i>
<i>A point to Geeta.</i>

1949
02:23:54,710 --> 02:23:57,790
<i>Geeta - 1; Angelina - 0.</i>

1950
02:23:59,500 --> 02:24:01,250
Go... Geeta, go!

1951
02:24:03,160 --> 02:24:04,370
<i>Geeta attacks again.</i>

1952
02:24:05,370 --> 02:24:07,000
<i>Angelina is in trouble.</i>

1953
02:24:07,830 --> 02:24:09,540
<i>Geeta maintains her grip.</i>

1954
02:24:10,160 --> 02:24:11,910
<i>Two more points for Geeta!</i>

1955
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,960
<i>Geeta - 3; Angelina - 0.</i>

1956
02:24:15,120 --> 02:24:18,000
<i>Geeta bearing down on Angelina.</i>

1957
02:24:22,290 --> 02:24:23,750
<i>Geeta attacks!</i>

1958
02:24:24,910 --> 02:24:26,620
<i>One more point for Geeta.</i>

1959
02:24:28,040 --> 02:24:28,910
<i>Two more points,</i>

1960
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:30,540
<i>and she'll win this round</i>
<i>by technical superiority,</i>

1961
02:24:30,620 --> 02:24:32,210
<i>and the championship!</i>

1962
02:24:32,830 --> 02:24:35,000
<i>Geeta bearing down</i>
<i>with all her might.</i>

1963
02:24:35,290 --> 02:24:37,120
<i>Will Geeta win?</i>

1964
02:24:39,080 --> 02:24:41,120
<i>The referee's whistle saves Angelina!</i>

1965
02:24:41,210 --> 02:24:43,250
No problem... Geeta!

1966
02:24:47,540 --> 02:24:49,460
<i>Angelina seems furious.</i>

1967
02:24:49,750 --> 02:24:51,580
<i>She's getting aggressive.</i>

1968
02:24:52,410 --> 02:24:54,290
<i>Geeta is still in the lead.</i>

1969
02:24:54,500 --> 02:24:58,250
<i>One point for Angelina.</i>
<i>Angelina - 1; Geeta - 4.</i>

1970
02:24:58,330 --> 02:25:00,160
<i>Geeta is still in danger.</i>

1971
02:25:01,370 --> 02:25:03,210
<i>Two more points for Angelina.</i>

1972
02:25:04,330 --> 02:25:08,000
<i>Geeta - 4; Angelina - 3.</i>
<i>With Geeta defending.</i>

1973
02:25:10,710 --> 02:25:12,290
No problem... come on!

1974
02:25:12,370 --> 02:25:14,750
<i>Geeta still leads by one point.</i>

1975
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:17,790
<i>She needs to hold on to it</i>
<i>a little longer.</i>

1976
02:25:19,210 --> 02:25:21,290
<i>Will Geeta retain this lead?</i>

1977
02:25:21,540 --> 02:25:23,500
<i>Angelina goes for it.</i>

1978
02:25:23,710 --> 02:25:25,160
<i>Time is running out.</i>

1979
02:25:25,410 --> 02:25:26,910
<i>Geeta defends well.</i>

1980
02:25:27,210 --> 02:25:30,750
<i>Angelina going all out.</i>
<i>Geeta just needs to...</i>

1981
02:25:30,960 --> 02:25:32,960
<i>Three points to Angelina!</i>

1982
02:25:33,210 --> 02:25:35,830
<i>Angelina - 6; Geeta - 4.</i>

1983
02:25:36,330 --> 02:25:39,370
<i>Geeta trying to get back in position.</i>
<i>She's low on time.</i>

1984
02:25:40,580 --> 02:25:42,870
<i>And this round comes to an end.</i>

1985
02:25:44,750 --> 02:25:48,960
<i>And Angelina has shown</i>
<i>what a true champion is made of!</i>

1986
02:25:49,710 --> 02:25:52,290
What are you doing?
You could've won the match!

1987
02:26:01,370 --> 02:26:04,040
<i>Angelina, with renewed enthusiasm.</i>

1988
02:26:04,500 --> 02:26:06,080
<i>Geeta is under pressure.</i>

1989
02:26:06,330 --> 02:26:10,750
<i>It's not going to be</i>
<i>easy for Geeta.</i>

1990
02:26:11,210 --> 02:26:13,580
<i>Angelina aggressive</i>
<i>from the start.</i>

1991
02:26:13,910 --> 02:26:15,250
<i>She goes for an attack.</i>

1992
02:26:16,710 --> 02:26:18,620
<i>Geeta is in trouble.</i>

1993
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:24,160
<i>Three points for Angelina!</i>

1994
02:26:24,750 --> 02:26:28,080
<i>A 3-point lead in the final round!</i>

1995
02:26:29,330 --> 02:26:32,290
<i>Angelina - 3; Geeta - 0.</i>

1996
02:26:34,460 --> 02:26:38,460
<i>Geeta tries to make a comeback.</i>
<i>But Angelina doesn't allow her.</i>

1997
02:26:40,410 --> 02:26:44,080
<i>Geeta attacks, Angelina counters.</i>
<i>Geeta is in trouble.</i>

1998
02:26:44,410 --> 02:26:46,540
<i>One more point to Angelina.</i>

1999
02:26:47,160 --> 02:26:50,250
<i>Angelina - 4; Geeta - 0.</i>

2000
02:26:50,660 --> 02:26:54,500
<i>And this match is leaning</i>
<i>in Angelina's favor.</i>

2001
02:26:54,790 --> 02:26:59,870
<i>If Geeta has to get back,</i>
<i>she needs to score fast.</i>

2002
02:27:00,290 --> 02:27:01,500
<i>But she has to be careful.</i>

2003
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:04,210
<i>Geeta is looking for an opportunity.</i>

2004
02:27:06,210 --> 02:27:07,960
<i>A clever move by Geeta.</i>

2005
02:27:08,120 --> 02:27:09,330
<i>She looks to score.</i>

2006
02:27:10,910 --> 02:27:13,210
<i>One point to Geeta!</i>

2007
02:27:15,540 --> 02:27:18,660
<i>Angelina - 4; Geeta - 1.</i>

2008
02:27:19,290 --> 02:27:21,250
<i>Time... running out.</i>

2009
02:27:21,500 --> 02:27:23,580
<i>Geeta needs to keep at it.</i>

2010
02:27:23,790 --> 02:27:26,620
<i>But carefully, because if</i>
<i>Angelina scores again,</i>

2011
02:27:26,830 --> 02:27:29,210
<i>it'll be impossible</i>
<i>to make a comeback.</i>

2012
02:27:33,540 --> 02:27:34,910
<i>Geeta makes an effort.</i>

2013
02:27:35,250 --> 02:27:36,250
<i>Geeta attacks,</i>

2014
02:27:36,330 --> 02:27:38,410
<i>but Angelina scores a point!</i>

2015
02:27:40,370 --> 02:27:43,370
<i>Angelina - 5; Geeta - 1.</i>

2016
02:27:44,870 --> 02:27:50,540
<i>It's almost impossible now</i>
<i>for Geeta to make a comeback!</i>

2017
02:27:59,620 --> 02:28:01,830
<i>Remember!</i>

2018
02:28:03,370 --> 02:28:06,330
<i>Your papa won't be there</i>
<i>to save you every time.</i>

2019
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:08,790
<i>I can only teach you to fight.</i>

2020
02:28:08,960 --> 02:28:10,410
<i>But you have to fight yourself.</i>

2021
02:28:10,580 --> 02:28:13,000
<i>Make the effort...</i>
<i>save yourself.</i>

2022
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,160
<i>Only 22 seconds left.</i>

2023
02:28:22,870 --> 02:28:26,160
<i>And Geeta is trailing by 4 points.</i>

2024
02:28:27,040 --> 02:28:28,160
<i>At this level,</i>

2025
02:28:28,250 --> 02:28:31,120
<i>it's almost impossible</i>

2026
02:28:31,210 --> 02:28:34,910
<i>to cover this lead in such short time.</i>

2027
02:28:46,290 --> 02:28:49,660
<i>To score five points is difficult,</i>

2028
02:28:51,120 --> 02:28:52,960
<i>but it can be done.</i>

2029
02:28:55,120 --> 02:28:57,000
<i>Geeta trying.</i>

2030
02:28:57,330 --> 02:29:01,410
<i>But Angelina stalling for time.</i>

2031
02:29:02,500 --> 02:29:05,210
<i>Just a few seconds left.</i>

2032
02:29:05,540 --> 02:29:09,790
<i>And India might have to</i>
<i>settle for a silver.</i>

2033
02:29:34,460 --> 02:29:37,120
<i>You have to play with</i>
<i>the opponent's mind.</i>

2034
02:29:39,460 --> 02:29:41,540
<i>Fake a move,</i>

2035
02:29:41,620 --> 02:29:42,910
<i>but make another.</i>

2036
02:29:50,540 --> 02:29:53,120
<i>And a fantastic move by Geeta.</i>

2037
02:29:55,250 --> 02:29:57,960
<i>Will time be on her side?</i>

2038
02:30:38,330 --> 02:30:40,290
<i>It's a gold for Geeta!</i>

2039
02:30:43,790 --> 02:30:48,960
<i>Geeta has achieved</i>
<i>the impossible!</i>

2040
02:30:49,370 --> 02:30:51,960
<i>She is the first ever</i>
<i>female Indian wrestler,</i>

2041
02:30:52,040 --> 02:30:54,660
<i>to win gold at the</i>
<i>Commonwealth Games!</i>

2042
02:30:55,960 --> 02:30:59,750
<i>Who would have thought that</i>
<i>a girl from a small village in India,</i>

2043
02:31:00,080 --> 02:31:03,410
<i>is capable of leaving her mark</i>
<i>on the whole world!</i>

2044
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:05,960
<i>Well done, Geeta!</i>

2045
02:31:06,660 --> 02:31:09,580
<i>A proud moment for India indeed!</i>

2046
02:31:55,250 --> 02:31:56,460
Champion!

2047
02:31:56,540 --> 02:31:57,790
Where's papa?

2048
02:31:58,500 --> 02:31:59,460
I don't know.

2049
02:31:59,540 --> 02:32:00,960
We came together though.

2050
02:32:14,460 --> 02:32:16,250
<i>And now the gold medal,</i>

2051
02:32:16,620 --> 02:32:19,410
<i>for India's Geeta Kumari Phogat.</i>

2052
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:27,210
<i>And now, as per tradition,</i>

2053
02:32:27,710 --> 02:32:31,160
<i>the national anthem of the</i>
<i>winning country will play.</i>

2054
02:33:32,830 --> 02:33:36,040
Victory to India!

2055
02:33:41,750 --> 02:33:43,620
Hey! What are you doing here?

2056
02:34:07,580 --> 02:34:11,000
Geeta, come...
the media is waiting.

2057
02:34:11,540 --> 02:34:12,370
Come.

2058
02:34:13,960 --> 02:34:15,500
Come. Everyone is waiting.

2059
02:34:17,790 --> 02:34:18,790
Come... come.

2060
02:35:19,750 --> 02:35:24,040
<i>And finally uncle uttered</i>
<i>those golden words,</i>

2061
02:35:24,290 --> 02:35:28,870
<i>that we had been pining to hear</i>
<i>for the past 10 years.</i>

2062
02:35:30,790 --> 02:35:32,710
I am proud of you!
