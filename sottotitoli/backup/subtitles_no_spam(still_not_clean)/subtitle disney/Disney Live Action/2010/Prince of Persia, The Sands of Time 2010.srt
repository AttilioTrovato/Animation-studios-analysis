1
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:13,815
<i>Long ago, in a land far away,</i>

2
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:18,540
<i>there once rose an empire,
that stretched from the steppes of China,</i>

3
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:22,058
<i>to the shores of the Mediterranean.</i>

4
00:01:23,577 --> 00:01:27,622
<i>That empire was Persia.</i>

5
00:01:27,834 --> 00:01:31,719
<i>Fierce in battle,
wise in victory,</i>

6
00:01:31,923 --> 00:01:35,603
<i>where the Persian sword went,
order followed.</i>

7
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:39,477
<i>The Persian King Sharaman,</i>

8
00:01:39,644 --> 00:01:46,643
<i>ruled with his brother Nizam
upon the principles of loyalty and brotherhood.</i>

9
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:50,375
<i>The King had two sons
who gave him great joy.</i>

10
00:01:50,523 --> 00:01:51,973
Rejoice!

11
00:01:52,037 --> 00:01:57,637
<i>But in the eyes of the gods,
the King's family was not yet complete.</i>

12
00:01:58,798 --> 00:02:02,397
<i>Not until the day he
witnessed a single act of courage</i>

13
00:02:02,594 --> 00:02:06,154
<i>by an orphan boy
from the streets of Nasaf.</i>

14
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:09,030
Get out of the way!

15
00:02:17,409 --> 00:02:20,408
Stop!
Stop!

16
00:02:25,838 --> 00:02:27,838
Run!

17
00:02:27,961 --> 00:02:29,926
Run, Bis!
Run!

18
00:02:35,352 --> 00:02:37,352
Stay here.

19
00:03:09,387 --> 00:03:11,087
He's getting away!

20
00:03:14,745 --> 00:03:17,144
Let go of me!

21
00:03:21,421 --> 00:03:24,861
In the King's name!

22
00:03:31,353 --> 00:03:35,033
- What is your name, boy?
- Dastan, Sir.

23
00:03:35,234 --> 00:03:38,233
And your parents?

24
00:03:41,576 --> 00:03:44,096
Boy...

25
00:03:47,711 --> 00:03:49,711
Brother, take him up.

26
00:03:49,839 --> 00:03:54,838
<i>Moved by what he saw, the King
adopted the boy Dastan into his family.</i>

27
00:03:55,889 --> 00:03:58,574
<i>A son with no royal blood,</i>

28
00:03:58,727 --> 00:04:01,452
<i>and no eye on his throne.</i>

29
00:04:01,606 --> 00:04:05,326
<i>But perhaps, there was something
else that worked that day.</i>

30
00:04:05,524 --> 00:04:08,769
<i>Something beyond simple understanding.</i>

31
00:04:09,953 --> 00:04:13,952
<i>The day, a boy from
the unlikeliest of places,</i>

32
00:04:14,161 --> 00:04:16,611
<i>became...</i>

33
00:04:16,754 --> 00:04:20,114
<i>a Prince of Persia.</i>

34
00:04:58,984 --> 00:05:01,864
The fabled Alamut,
even more stunning than I imagine.

35
00:05:02,031 --> 00:05:04,796
Don't be fooled by its beauty prince Tates.
It's a city like any others.

36
00:05:04,952 --> 00:05:08,752
Soft countries make soft men.
They stooped to treachery, and now must pay for it.

37
00:05:08,953 --> 00:05:11,563
The father made clear,
Alamut is not to be touched.

38
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:15,311
Some consider it sacred.
But since our wise father isn't here,

39
00:05:15,504 --> 00:05:17,634
the decision rests with me.

40
00:05:17,762 --> 00:05:21,162
I'll have one last counsel
with my noble uncle,

41
00:05:21,346 --> 00:05:25,191
and my two brothers,
trusted Garsiv, and...

42
00:05:27,695 --> 00:05:29,660
Where's Dastan?

43
00:05:29,781 --> 00:05:32,260
Come on! I bet my entire month's
allowance on this!

44
00:05:32,404 --> 00:05:34,849
- This is embarrassing!
- Why don't you give it a try?

45
00:05:34,997 --> 00:05:37,477
Give it in here!

46
00:05:40,213 --> 00:05:42,693
Is that all you got?

47
00:05:46,765 --> 00:05:48,765
Prince Dastan!

48
00:05:49,561 --> 00:05:51,680
Where's prince Dastan?

49
00:05:51,808 --> 00:05:54,053
Prince Dastan isn't here.

50
00:05:54,192 --> 00:05:58,072
Your Highness, please.
Prince Tus has convened the war council.

51
00:05:58,277 --> 00:06:00,842
I'm on my way.

52
00:06:03,331 --> 00:06:09,650
Our finest spy, intercepted
a caravan leaving Alamut.

53
00:06:10,675 --> 00:06:13,555
Swords, of the best workmanship.

54
00:06:14,431 --> 00:06:16,796
Steel tipped arrows.

55
00:06:16,935 --> 00:06:21,215
A promise of payment from the
Warlord Kosh, to Alamut.

56
00:06:21,437 --> 00:06:23,967
They're selling weapons
to our enemies, Dastan.

57
00:06:24,113 --> 00:06:26,433
An arrow such as this
slew my horse in Kushkan.

58
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:28,780
Blood will run
in Alamut's streets for this.

59
00:06:28,911 --> 00:06:31,476
Or our soldiers will fall
from its walls.

60
00:06:31,623 --> 00:06:35,583
Our orders were to subdue Kushkan,
not to attack Alamut.

61
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:39,716
- Wise words, little brother.
- Words won't stop our enemies,

62
00:06:39,923 --> 00:06:43,088
once they're armed
with Alamutian blades.

63
00:06:57,412 --> 00:07:00,092
We attack at dawn.

64
00:07:02,003 --> 00:07:04,883
Well, if that's your decision,
then let me go in first.

65
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,638
- Who wants to share, Garsiv?
- I'll ride at the head of the Persian Army!

66
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:11,129
Dastan leads the company
of street rabble!

67
00:07:11,266 --> 00:07:14,031
They may not be much for manners,
but they're pretty handy in a fight.

68
00:07:14,187 --> 00:07:18,107
- The honor of first blood should be mine.
- Garsiv, you've got your hands on your sword again.

69
00:07:18,314 --> 00:07:21,639
- Where's it should be.
- Oh, my brothers...

70
00:07:21,824 --> 00:07:23,904
Ever eager.

71
00:07:24,412 --> 00:07:29,011
It's said the princess of Alamut,
is a beauty without equal.

72
00:07:29,836 --> 00:07:33,716
We'll march into her palace
and see for ourselves.

73
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:41,010
There'll be no doubt of your courage
Dastan, but you're not ready for this.

74
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:45,350
Garsiv's cavalry will lead the way.

75
00:08:01,008 --> 00:08:06,207
Princess Tamina, the Persian Army
my princess, has not moved on.

76
00:08:07,184 --> 00:08:12,384
Their faith has little love
for any truth, other than its own.

77
00:08:12,645 --> 00:08:16,530
Or perhaps it would be safer
if you didn't stand so close.

78
00:08:16,782 --> 00:08:19,982
Whatever their faith,
their bows aren't that strong,

79
00:08:20,157 --> 00:08:22,442
Nor it's their aim.

80
00:08:22,577 --> 00:08:24,586
Gather the council.

81
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:27,990
Tell them, I sit in the High Temple,
I must pray.

82
00:08:28,173 --> 00:08:32,253
The High Temple? Alamut hasn't been
breached in a thousand years.

83
00:08:32,467 --> 00:08:35,317
Everything changes with time.

84
00:08:35,477 --> 00:08:37,477
We should know this
best of all.

85
00:08:43,989 --> 00:08:46,194
Remind me why we're
disobeying your brother's orders?

86
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:50,806
Because Garsiv only knows how
to attack head-on, it would be a massacre.

87
00:08:52,252 --> 00:08:55,252
The Alamutians would be busy
with the main gate, so we slip through the side.

88
00:09:24,466 --> 00:09:26,706
Have you been drinking?

89
00:10:06,738 --> 00:10:09,818
That's our way in.
There are two gates.

90
00:10:09,993 --> 00:10:13,638
The outer one's easy,
it's the inner gate that's impossible.

91
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:17,433
That gate mechanism
is protected by two men gard towers.

92
00:10:18,215 --> 00:10:20,934
Yeah, there's always a way in, Bis,
you take care of the outer gate,

93
00:10:21,052 --> 00:10:23,051
you leave the impossible one to me.

94
00:10:23,174 --> 00:10:25,439
That's how you won't be
happy if you get us all killed.

95
00:10:25,538 --> 00:10:27,237
Oh. Wonderful speech, Bis.

96
00:10:27,348 --> 00:10:29,593
Rousing!

97
00:10:40,122 --> 00:10:42,202
Sound the alarm!

98
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:17,672
Hold this.

99
00:12:01,494 --> 00:12:03,694
Watch your back.

100
00:12:15,558 --> 00:12:18,197
- Eastern gate's open.
- That's Dastan's men.

101
00:12:18,728 --> 00:12:21,808
He's gotten in, Dastan's done it.

102
00:12:22,234 --> 00:12:25,694
Redeploy to the eastern gate.

103
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,305
Redeploy to the eastern gate!

104
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:02,503
They breached the eastern gate.

105
00:13:02,628 --> 00:13:05,828
- Collapse the passages to the chamber.
- Princess.

106
00:13:07,218 --> 00:13:10,498
Go now, everyone.

107
00:15:17,914 --> 00:15:22,954
- You know what you must do.
- Our wealth must be kept safe.

108
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:45,340
Out of the way!

109
00:17:12,378 --> 00:17:15,858
Silly songs and scented smoke
could do little for you now!

110
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:20,530
I think you'll find there's more
to her than that, hey Garsiv?!

111
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:37,566
So for once, the stories are true.

112
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:42,410
We know you secretly build
weapons for enemies of Persia.

113
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,645
- Now show us where.
- We have no forges here.

114
00:17:46,805 --> 00:17:48,885
And what weapons we had
you overcame.

115
00:17:49,016 --> 00:17:51,576
Our spies say differently.
You can save a lot of pain...

116
00:17:51,729 --> 00:17:55,409
All the pain in the world will not help
you find something that does not exist.

117
00:17:55,605 --> 00:18:00,050
Spoken like one wise enough
to consider a political solution.

118
00:18:01,202 --> 00:18:05,881
- Join hands with Persia's future King.
- I'll die first.

119
00:18:15,306 --> 00:18:17,386
That can be arranged.

120
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:20,078
Don't!

121
00:18:31,121 --> 00:18:33,961
Prince Tus...

122
00:18:39,468 --> 00:18:45,987
Promise me, the people of Alamut
will be treated with mercy.

123
00:18:55,867 --> 00:18:59,347
Hey, the Lion of Persia!
The Lion of Persia!

124
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:02,499
They're calling you
the Lion of Persia.

125
00:19:03,169 --> 00:19:06,734
You've never excelled
at following order, Dastan.

126
00:19:06,925 --> 00:19:10,605
- I have some explaining to do, Tus. I...
- No, no.

127
00:19:12,434 --> 00:19:16,919
No, you have some celebrating to do.
There is however, tradition.

128
00:19:17,149 --> 00:19:22,228
Since you took the honor
of first assault, you owe me a gift, homage.

129
00:19:24,535 --> 00:19:28,175
- A beautiful dagger.
- He delivered you the city and its princess,

130
00:19:28,369 --> 00:19:31,091
- I think that's homage enough.
- I suppose it is.

131
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:34,497
First dispatches just arrived, my prince.
Wonderful news.

132
00:19:34,676 --> 00:19:38,676
Your father's interrupted his prayers
in the eastern palace to join us.

133
00:19:39,808 --> 00:19:42,808
No doubt to commend this
on our great victory.

134
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:05,504
We've had indications that Alamut
was arming our enemies.

135
00:20:05,624 --> 00:20:11,358
Indications? You've got to have
more than indications  to occupy a holy city,

136
00:20:11,607 --> 00:20:13,606
with my troops!

137
00:20:13,729 --> 00:20:18,893
This adventure, won't sit
with our allies!

138
00:20:19,153 --> 00:20:22,798
But I suppose
you didn't take that into account.

139
00:20:22,998 --> 00:20:26,643
Don't look for your uncle, boy!

140
00:20:26,837 --> 00:20:30,557
The decisions and its consequences
rest with me.

141
00:20:37,394 --> 00:20:41,874
I know you're eager to wear the crown.
But trust me when I tell you, you're not yet ready.

142
00:20:48,411 --> 00:20:52,131
No man would know better
than you, father.

143
00:20:55,297 --> 00:20:58,296
Because your trust
is something I deeply cherish.

144
00:20:58,467 --> 00:21:01,427
I'll oversee the search for
weapons myself.

145
00:21:01,597 --> 00:21:06,477
I vow I will not stand before you
until I hold proof for Alamut's treachery.

146
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:39,650
The third step is the hardest!

147
00:21:39,816 --> 00:21:42,141
Brother!

148
00:21:42,284 --> 00:21:48,164
We've uncovered signs of tunnels on the
eastern edge of the city. I'm on my way there now.

149
00:21:48,455 --> 00:21:50,900
Oh, you'll miss the banquet!

150
00:21:51,047 --> 00:21:53,527
You and Garsiv can handle father
in my absence.

151
00:21:53,671 --> 00:21:57,035
- You do have a gift to honor him with.
- Of course.

152
00:21:57,217 --> 00:22:00,347
Bis, gift!

153
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:03,119
It's been momentarily misplaced!

154
00:22:03,268 --> 00:22:05,798
I knew you'd forget.

155
00:22:05,944 --> 00:22:08,709
The prayer robe of Alamut's regent.

156
00:22:08,866 --> 00:22:13,345
The holiest in Eastern lands,
a gift the King would appreciate.

157
00:22:13,956 --> 00:22:18,356
You fought like a champion for me,
Dastan. Glad to return the favor.

158
00:22:21,175 --> 00:22:24,975
A rare jewel. Present her
to the King for me this evening, Dastan.

159
00:22:26,058 --> 00:22:29,378
Sure you really want another
wife, brother?

160
00:22:30,565 --> 00:22:33,244
Listen to me, Dastan!

161
00:22:33,402 --> 00:22:37,482
A marriage to the princess
assures me the loyalty of her people.

162
00:22:37,695 --> 00:22:41,225
Unbound to us,
she's a dangerous liability.

163
00:22:41,414 --> 00:22:47,694
If father doesn't approve our union,
I want you to end her life with your own hand.

164
00:22:56,437 --> 00:23:00,602
So, I'm escorted by prince Dastan,
the Lion of Persia.

165
00:23:00,818 --> 00:23:04,698
Must feel wonderful winning such a claim
for destroying such an innocent city.

166
00:23:04,908 --> 00:23:07,268
Oh, a pleasure to meet you too, princess.

167
00:23:07,412 --> 00:23:10,397
And allow me to offer,
that if punishing the enemies of my king

168
00:23:10,527 --> 00:23:12,620
is a crime, then it's one I'll gladly repeat.

169
00:23:12,747 --> 00:23:16,792
Then you are a true prince of Persia.
Brutal. Without honor.

170
00:23:17,009 --> 00:23:20,849
Don't make the mistake
of thinking you know me, princess.

171
00:23:21,052 --> 00:23:24,857
- Oh, and what more is there?
- Wait here with Her Highness.

172
00:23:26,065 --> 00:23:29,185
If you can manage it.

173
00:23:30,029 --> 00:23:33,228
I suggest a hint of humility
when you're presented to the King.

174
00:23:33,403 --> 00:23:35,768
For your own good.

175
00:23:45,177 --> 00:23:47,337
You've eased father's anger , uncle?

176
00:23:47,472 --> 00:23:52,151
One day, you'll have the pleasure
of being brother to the king, Dastan.

177
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:56,472
As long as you remember your most important duty,
you should do well.

178
00:23:56,686 --> 00:24:00,734
- Oh, and what's that?
- Making sure his wine glass stays full.

179
00:24:01,451 --> 00:24:07,331
I'm told that another of my sons
has joined the rank of great Persian Warrior.

180
00:24:15,096 --> 00:24:21,896
- We missed you, father.
- I was praying for you and your brothers, Dastan.

181
00:24:22,817 --> 00:24:29,981
Family, the bond between brothers
that is the sword, that defends our empire.

182
00:24:30,328 --> 00:24:34,408
And I pray that that sword
remains strong.

183
00:24:35,127 --> 00:24:39,327
I was hoping my actions
would spare our men unnecessary losses.

184
00:24:42,346 --> 00:24:45,191
A good man would've done
as you did, Dastan.

185
00:24:45,351 --> 00:24:50,870
Acting boldly and courageously
to bring the victory and spare lives.

186
00:24:51,818 --> 00:24:55,583
A great man would've stopped
the attack from happening at all,

187
00:24:55,783 --> 00:25:00,783
a great man would've stopped
what he knew to be wrong,

188
00:25:01,036 --> 00:25:04,366
no matter who was ordering.

189
00:25:04,546 --> 00:25:08,310
The boy I saw in that square,

190
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:11,590
was capable of being
more than just good,

191
00:25:11,765 --> 00:25:15,725
but of being...great.

192
00:25:19,485 --> 00:25:24,365
Well in the meantime,
I have a gift for you.

193
00:25:27,413 --> 00:25:33,013
Some questiones the wisdom of my
bringing a boy from the streets into my family.

194
00:25:33,292 --> 00:25:37,017
I saw a boy whose blood
wasn't noble,

195
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:42,380
but whose character was,
a King in spirit.

196
00:25:43,355 --> 00:25:45,834
Thank you, father.

197
00:25:45,983 --> 00:25:50,063
May I present,
the prayer robe of Alamut's regent.

198
00:25:59,963 --> 00:26:02,843
What can I grant you, in return?

199
00:26:11,229 --> 00:26:14,189
May I present the princess Tamina.

200
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:17,439
Tus wishes to make a union
with her people through marriage.

201
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:21,494
It is my deepest wish
that this win your approval.

202
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:31,789
In all my travels, I have never looked
upon a more beautiful city, Your Highness.

203
00:26:32,929 --> 00:26:38,209
You should've seen it before your
horde of camel-ridding illiterates descended upon it.

204
00:26:40,107 --> 00:26:44,106
Clear as you will make a fine queen.

205
00:26:46,157 --> 00:26:50,642
But...Tus already has enough wives.

206
00:26:50,872 --> 00:26:54,472
You Dastan, might take fewer chances,

207
00:26:54,665 --> 00:26:57,987
if such a jewel
waited you in your chamber.

208
00:26:58,167 --> 00:27:03,454
The princess of Alamut
will be your first wife.

209
00:27:07,439 --> 00:27:10,724
Oh, what say you, Dastan?

210
00:27:10,902 --> 00:27:17,182
He plunges into a hundred foes without thought,
but before marriage, he stands frozen with fear,

211
00:27:17,491 --> 00:27:21,256
and that's for those who say
he's not yet wise.

212
00:27:21,454 --> 00:27:24,139
I need a drink.

213
00:27:30,807 --> 00:27:33,327
Stand aside.
Out of my way!

214
00:27:40,406 --> 00:27:43,885
- Father...
- Oh, God help us, the robe, it's poisoned!

215
00:27:44,077 --> 00:27:46,357
- Somebody help him!
- The robe Dastan gave him!

216
00:27:46,492 --> 00:27:49,434
- Why?!
- Somebody help him!

217
00:27:49,598 --> 00:27:52,506
- Seize the murderer!
- Somebody help him!

218
00:28:05,443 --> 00:28:07,563
- Bis! Bis!
- Come with me!

219
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:21,996
- What do you think you're doing?
- I can get us out of here!

220
00:28:22,171 --> 00:28:25,336
- You're going to need my help.
- Come on!

221
00:28:39,869 --> 00:28:41,949
- Close the gate!
- That way!

222
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,040
Close the gate!

223
00:28:50,219 --> 00:28:52,219
Get down!

224
00:28:55,101 --> 00:28:59,300
There, onto the murderer!
He's on my horse! He stole my horse!

225
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:14,480
<i> My loyal subjects, the whole world
grieves at the death of our beloved King.</i>

226
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:16,800
<i> We are all stricken
by his loss.</i>

227
00:29:16,926 --> 00:29:21,725
<i> But the murder came at prince
Dastan's hand, only makes our pain worse.</i>

228
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:25,734
I didn't murder my father.
That robe was given to me by my brother.

229
00:29:25,933 --> 00:29:30,778
- Tus did this.
- And now he stands to be crowned king.

230
00:29:32,365 --> 00:29:35,565
I didn't kill my father.

231
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:39,518
- I believe you.
- You shouldn't be here,

232
00:29:39,627 --> 00:29:44,546
- I shouldn't have let you come.
- But you did.

233
00:29:48,389 --> 00:29:53,029
I promised my brother I'll kill you,
if he couldn't have you.

234
00:29:53,418 --> 00:29:58,917
Well, the solution would be
to kiss me, and then kill me.

235
00:29:59,656 --> 00:30:02,176
But I have a better solution.

236
00:30:05,415 --> 00:30:08,535
I kill you,
and your problems are solved!

237
00:30:12,008 --> 00:30:14,887
Perhaps we could find
another solution.

238
00:30:51,818 --> 00:30:54,737
Well, the solution would be
to kiss me, and then kill me.

239
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,465
But I have a better solution.

240
00:30:57,993 --> 00:31:00,193
I kill you!

241
00:31:06,548 --> 00:31:10,348
Give back what you stole, Persian!

242
00:31:12,682 --> 00:31:14,682
No!

243
00:31:29,375 --> 00:31:32,414
- Did you see that?
- See what?

244
00:31:33,881 --> 00:31:35,801
Go for that sword again,
and I swear I'll break your arm.

245
00:31:35,885 --> 00:31:37,884
Again?

246
00:31:38,805 --> 00:31:42,005
- You've used up all the sand!
- What?

247
00:31:42,644 --> 00:31:45,044
What is this?

248
00:31:47,652 --> 00:31:50,417
Incredible.

249
00:31:50,573 --> 00:31:55,292
Releasing the sand,
turns back time.

250
00:31:57,249 --> 00:32:00,849
And only the holder
of the Dagger is aware what's happened.

251
00:32:02,758 --> 00:32:06,198
He could go back and alter events,
change time.

252
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:08,428
And no one knows, but him.

253
00:32:10,686 --> 00:32:14,206
How much can it unliken?
Answer me, princess.

254
00:32:14,395 --> 00:32:17,480
You destroyed my city.

255
00:32:18,615 --> 00:32:22,455
Our invasion wasn't about weapons
forges, it was about this Dagger.

256
00:32:23,873 --> 00:32:26,313
After the battle, Tus asked
for this Dagger as tribute,

257
00:32:26,455 --> 00:32:28,825
I didn't think anything of it,
but now I see.

258
00:32:28,964 --> 00:32:32,083
With it, he could change anything. He could
change the course of a critical moment in battle,

259
00:32:32,255 --> 00:32:35,065
He could foresee the blade of a rival.

260
00:32:35,223 --> 00:32:37,623
He wouldn't just be the king,
he'd be the most powerful ruler Persia ever seen,

261
00:32:37,763 --> 00:32:41,213
greater even than my father.
It was all about this dagger!

262
00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:44,964
<i> My treacherous brother
must be brought to justice.</i>

263
00:32:45,155 --> 00:32:48,400
<i> And as such, I have doubled
the reward for his capture.</i>

264
00:32:48,577 --> 00:32:53,856
<i> Meanwhile, I shall strive to protect
our Empire, as my father would've demanded.</i>

265
00:32:54,126 --> 00:32:57,571
<i>A new reign has begun.</i>

266
00:32:57,757 --> 00:33:00,637
- What are you doing?
- Garsiv can't be far behind us.

267
00:33:00,803 --> 00:33:04,443
She is the most famous horse in the Empire,
this would skew its tracks.

268
00:33:04,637 --> 00:33:08,206
- Tracks where, where are you going?
- To Avrat, where my father will be buried.

269
00:33:08,398 --> 00:33:11,197
You're wanted for the King's murder,
you're going to march into his funeral

270
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:13,439
alongside thousands of
Persian soldiers.

271
00:33:13,567 --> 00:33:16,492
I hope Nizam will be there,
he's the only one I can trust.

272
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:19,820
He'll see I was set up by Tus,
step aside, princess.

273
00:33:19,999 --> 00:33:22,079
Every road to Avrat
will be covered with Persian troops.

274
00:33:22,205 --> 00:33:24,655
Well I a'm not taking roads,
I'm going through the Valley of the Slaves.

275
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:27,677
No one goes near that wasteland,
it's filled with murderers and cutthroats.

276
00:33:27,838 --> 00:33:30,683
- Yes, so they say.
- Your whole plan is suicide.

277
00:33:30,848 --> 00:33:32,928
My brother murdered my father,
and left his blood on my hands.

278
00:33:33,055 --> 00:33:35,220
If I die trying to set that right,
then so be it.

279
00:33:38,026 --> 00:33:41,591
So, you're going to leave me here,
in the middle of nowhere?!

280
00:33:41,782 --> 00:33:44,982
Noble Dastan, abandoning a helpless
woman in the wilderness.

281
00:33:45,157 --> 00:33:49,001
What does your precious
honor have to say about that?

282
00:33:51,254 --> 00:33:54,294
Oh, give me the strength not to kill her.

283
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:04,400
Mounts up, we can't be far behind him.

284
00:34:10,032 --> 00:34:13,632
Without the right sand, it's just
another knife. Not even very sharp.

285
00:34:17,961 --> 00:34:21,881
- This sand, is there more of it?
- Of course not.

286
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:26,227
- How can I get some?
- Try standing on your head

287
00:34:26,327 --> 00:34:28,547
and holding your breath.

288
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:38,270
Did you see
what you're looking for, prince?

289
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:41,450
Start walking.

290
00:34:48,256 --> 00:34:50,536
So, if you can't prove to your uncle
how the Dagger works,

291
00:34:50,636 --> 00:34:52,435
why on the world would
he believe you?

292
00:34:52,549 --> 00:34:55,234
It's not your problem, princess.

293
00:34:55,387 --> 00:34:57,912
You know, you really walk like one.

294
00:34:58,063 --> 00:35:01,863
Head held high, chest out,
long stomping strides.

295
00:35:03,154 --> 00:35:05,833
The walk of a self-satisfied
Persian prince.

296
00:35:05,991 --> 00:35:09,071
No doubt it comes from being told
since birth, the world is yours,

297
00:35:09,241 --> 00:35:12,971
- And you actually believing it.
- I wasn't born in a palace like you!

298
00:35:13,169 --> 00:35:17,569
I was born in the slums of Nasaf,
where I lived if I fought and I clawed for it.

299
00:35:18,385 --> 00:35:23,085
- And how did you become a prince?
- The king, marches the market one day,

300
00:35:23,289 --> 00:35:27,628
and he... I don't know, he...

301
00:35:27,852 --> 00:35:30,742
He found me.

302
00:35:30,904 --> 00:35:34,984
He took me in, he gave me
a family, he gave me a home.

303
00:35:41,462 --> 00:35:48,061
What you're looking at is,
the walk of a man, who just lost everything.

304
00:35:53,354 --> 00:35:57,354
Welcome to the Valley of Slaves,
Your Highness.

305
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:06,244
- I'm desperate for a drop of water.
- Well, there's more than we have

306
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:09,140
since you emptied our canteen hours ago.

307
00:36:09,295 --> 00:36:13,775
I wasn't born in this desert like
you Persians, all shriveled and angry.

308
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:20,015
- My constitution is much more... delicate.
- I think you mean spoiled.

309
00:36:20,312 --> 00:36:24,116
The wells of Alamut are fame
for their clean, cold water.

310
00:36:24,317 --> 00:36:28,237
Perhaps less time admiring your wells,
and more time guarding your walls,

311
00:36:28,408 --> 00:36:30,407
and you wouldn't be here.

312
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:39,710
Ah, a miracle, I've silenced a princess!

313
00:36:41,843 --> 00:36:45,163
Tamina?
Tamina?

314
00:36:48,103 --> 00:36:50,583
Can you hear me?

315
00:36:53,862 --> 00:36:56,942
Yes, Dastan,
I can hear you.

316
00:37:15,728 --> 00:37:18,368
Do you know
where you are Persian?

317
00:37:19,066 --> 00:37:21,471
And yet you're enter still?

318
00:37:21,611 --> 00:37:25,256
In the heart of Sudan there's
a tribe of warriors, known as the M'Baka.

319
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:27,971
They strike fear into the hearts
of all they cross.

320
00:37:28,116 --> 00:37:31,326
The M'Baka, are masters
of the throwing knife.

321
00:37:31,502 --> 00:37:36,267
Wielding blades, said to have been blessed
by the Creator, Himself.

322
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:41,909
Their aim is so murderously accurate,
they can decapitate three men,

323
00:37:42,179 --> 00:37:44,544
with one strike.

324
00:37:45,481 --> 00:37:48,481
No. I wouldn't even bother doing that,
if I were you. Do you know why?

325
00:37:49,362 --> 00:37:55,122
This is Seso, he is a M'Baka,
I have the good fortune of saving his life,

326
00:37:55,413 --> 00:37:59,372
which means, he is now
enduringly indebted to me.

327
00:37:59,961 --> 00:38:03,130
So tell me Persian,
is there any good reason why I shouldn't

328
00:38:03,268 --> 00:38:09,098
tell Seso, to put his next throw
so little higher?

329
00:38:46,531 --> 00:38:49,611
So, this is the one, eh?

330
00:38:50,287 --> 00:38:53,647
Yes, you're right,
she's not bad.

331
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:03,430
She could smell better than that.
Still we have a deal.

332
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:07,120
- Clever princess.
- Deal?

333
00:39:07,307 --> 00:39:09,392
What deal?

334
00:39:10,192 --> 00:39:13,557
- Such a noble prince.
- Such a gentle princess.

335
00:39:13,739 --> 00:39:18,238
I've taken you over with my fainting act,
eagerly leaping to assist the foreign beauty.

336
00:39:18,469 --> 00:39:20,934
- Who said you're a beauty?
- There's must be a reason

337
00:39:21,042 --> 00:39:22,041
why you can't take your
eyes off me.

338
00:39:23,164 --> 00:39:25,494
You're... I...

339
00:39:25,632 --> 00:39:28,117
I don't trust you,
and you're not my type.

340
00:39:28,261 --> 00:39:32,021
Oh, I'm not some desperate slave girl!
I'm actually capable of voicing my own folks!

341
00:39:32,225 --> 00:39:37,224
- Too many for my taste.
- Oh yeah, she'll make a very nice addition.

342
00:39:37,477 --> 00:39:39,687
What you intend to do with her?

343
00:39:39,819 --> 00:39:43,699
Yes, do tell him.
Can't you see how concerned he is?

344
00:39:44,618 --> 00:39:46,938
- Give me a moment.
- Yeah.

345
00:39:49,125 --> 00:39:52,884
It's hard for me to admit,
but you were right.

346
00:39:55,676 --> 00:40:00,076
- I did see what I was looking for.
- Dastan, listen to me.

347
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:04,559
When my uncle sees the power
of this Dagger, he'll believe me.

348
00:40:04,774 --> 00:40:08,419
Dastan, I know. I haven't been
entirely honest with you.

349
00:40:08,613 --> 00:40:13,412
- But your lies are so clever.
- I'm the guardian of the divine covenant.

350
00:40:13,656 --> 00:40:17,101
That Dagger is sacred, it's been
smuggled to a safety when you stole it.

351
00:40:17,292 --> 00:40:20,032
- If the Dagger gets into the wrong hands....
- I will take care of your knife.

352
00:40:20,187 --> 00:40:24,857
- You don't want to miss this.
- You don't understand what's at stake!

353
00:40:25,096 --> 00:40:29,096
- This is the matter for the gods, not man!
- Your gods, not mine. Come on!

354
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:35,224
Come on!

355
00:40:38,136 --> 00:40:40,946
Run quickly. Come on, ostrich!

356
00:40:46,879 --> 00:40:49,879
- Ostrich racing?
- Every Tuesday and Thursday.

357
00:40:50,468 --> 00:40:55,347
Whatever they like in beauty,
they make up for it. Fighting spirit.

358
00:40:56,727 --> 00:41:01,527
- And the races are easy to fix.
- I've heard all these terrible stories of this place.

359
00:41:01,771 --> 00:41:05,301
The bloodthirsty slaves,
murdering their masters?

360
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:09,650
That's a good story, it's well told,
ever evolving, but alas untrue.

361
00:41:09,872 --> 00:41:13,671
- But the skeletons that we saw...
- Ah, I bought those from a gypsy in Bukhara.

362
00:41:13,872 --> 00:41:19,237
I crafted our lurid reputation,
in order to fend off the most insidious evil,

363
00:41:19,506 --> 00:41:21,831
that's been lurking this
forsaken country of ours.

364
00:41:21,973 --> 00:41:24,253
You know what I'm talkin' about?
Taxes.

365
00:41:26,021 --> 00:41:31,140
Dirty Persians, their armies, their fortresses,
their roads, who pays for it all, eh?

366
00:41:31,654 --> 00:41:33,734
The small businessmen.

367
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:39,066
You see, that's why I started
a little campaign, to spread some false notoriety.

368
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,320
I spread it like a venerable
disease in a Turkish harem.

369
00:42:03,494 --> 00:42:06,374
Behold the mighty ostrich!

370
00:42:12,757 --> 00:42:15,677
Come on, my beauty!

371
00:42:21,104 --> 00:42:23,584
I love this!

372
00:42:23,733 --> 00:42:30,012
And the tax collectors stay clear of me,
and my customers, everybody's happy.

373
00:42:30,784 --> 00:42:35,904
Hey! Get the girls on! Get the girls on,
come on. Crowd control!

374
00:42:37,587 --> 00:42:40,587
Don't you stand there!
Run, don't walk!

375
00:42:41,885 --> 00:42:44,645
Hey, you drop anything, you pay for it!
It's out of your wages.

376
00:42:44,806 --> 00:42:47,485
Don't look at me like that,
you know what I'm talkin' about!

377
00:42:47,638 --> 00:42:50,283
Do your job, crowd control.
Thank you!

378
00:42:50,439 --> 00:42:54,639
You know, I think our little arrange
is going to work out very well, young man.

379
00:42:56,782 --> 00:43:00,662
- Don't touch!
- Oh, ho, ho! She's a lively one! Where did you find her?

380
00:43:02,833 --> 00:43:05,717
In the slave market to Lurs
I was headed to Avrat.

381
00:43:05,879 --> 00:43:08,759
I trade her for a camel,
when she attacked me!

382
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,765
- The camels are safer.
- Noble, Sheik Amar.

383
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:15,070
I appreciate your hospitality,
you run a fine establishment.

384
00:43:15,242 --> 00:43:18,312
- But if you could give me the supply...
- You know something, Persian?

385
00:43:18,482 --> 00:43:25,161
You bear a remarkable resemblance to the disgrace prince,
who fled after murdering the king.

386
00:43:34,631 --> 00:43:37,671
Have I told you about
the M'Baka?

387
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:42,065
- Yes, you have.
- Eh, nothing beats a good story. Eh, but yours however,

388
00:43:42,232 --> 00:43:46,665
trading her for a camel? Please.
I mean look at her. She's worth at least, two.

389
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:49,180
And as for you, young man,

390
00:43:49,465 --> 00:43:52,545
did you know your brothers offered rewards
for you, it's quite frankly,

391
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:57,699
between you and me, borders on the obscene.
I traded my own mother for that kind of gold.

392
00:43:57,952 --> 00:44:00,882
What? You didn't know
what she was like?

393
00:44:01,046 --> 00:44:04,045
Take him down to the Persian outpost.

394
00:44:04,176 --> 00:44:06,175
Wait, wait, wait.  Look, that...

395
00:44:09,182 --> 00:44:11,582
- Nice knife.
- It's nothing.

396
00:44:13,689 --> 00:44:16,569
- That's worthless.
- Really?

397
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:19,929
Melt it down for the jewels.

398
00:44:42,774 --> 00:44:45,294
What's the boy doing?!

399
00:44:46,321 --> 00:44:48,921
No, no,  you might kill a bird!

400
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:54,601
Hey, over here!

401
00:45:04,182 --> 00:45:07,142
- I wouldn't do that, if I were you!
- Get to the tunnel!

402
00:45:08,522 --> 00:45:11,722
Look at this! That's it.
No more fermented goat's milk

403
00:45:11,902 --> 00:45:15,102
after the third race,
do you hear me? Get off, come on!

404
00:45:15,277 --> 00:45:17,722
- The gate!
- Get him!

405
00:45:18,198 --> 00:45:19,843
Stop!

406
00:45:24,712 --> 00:45:27,597
- Lift the lever, it opens the gate!
- Give me the Dagger!

407
00:45:27,759 --> 00:45:31,039
- This isn't the time, lift that lever!
- Give me the Dagger!

408
00:45:35,145 --> 00:45:38,025
Don't think it didn't cross my mind.

409
00:45:42,447 --> 00:45:44,447
Move, princess!

410
00:45:45,577 --> 00:45:46,577
Dastan!

411
00:45:48,290 --> 00:45:51,090
Persian!

412
00:45:58,931 --> 00:46:01,930
Looking for this?

413
00:46:05,107 --> 00:46:08,067
Next time, you...!

414
00:46:16,666 --> 00:46:20,145
They all come for my father's funeral.

415
00:46:29,894 --> 00:46:32,694
There are a hundred Persian soldiers
watching that gate.

416
00:46:32,857 --> 00:46:35,337
Maybe more, if want you to stay closer
to this Dagger,

417
00:46:35,445 --> 00:46:37,444
you're going to have to help me
in the Avrat.

418
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:47,080
All these foreign dignitaries,
I'm guessing you're known up here.

419
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:06,797
Couldn't you have found
somebody lighter?

420
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:10,630
The Mugals of the Hindu Kush
are noble people, you should be honored.

421
00:47:12,166 --> 00:47:14,846
Oh yes, terribly.

422
00:47:21,889 --> 00:47:24,969
- Dastan, where's the Dagger?
- You're welcome to search me for it.

423
00:47:25,138 --> 00:47:28,503
You'll have to be very thorough.

424
00:47:40,333 --> 00:47:43,933
Tus isn't here,
he must be in Alamut.

425
00:47:45,675 --> 00:47:49,675
The Sand that fills the Dagger, there's more
that hidden somewhere in Alamut, isn't there?

426
00:47:49,884 --> 00:47:53,729
That's why Tus stays there.
That's why he's got our army searching for.

427
00:47:54,188 --> 00:47:57,227
I have to get a message
to my uncle to meet me.

428
00:47:57,395 --> 00:48:00,040
That's impossible.

429
00:48:59,953 --> 00:49:02,913
- Difficult, not impossible.
- One more proof, you're insane.

430
00:49:03,083 --> 00:49:05,443
Why do you look so impressed?

431
00:49:05,586 --> 00:49:08,186
Out of the way!
Make way!

432
00:49:13,055 --> 00:49:15,695
- Turn around!
- What?

433
00:49:27,077 --> 00:49:29,877
You used to buy those for me,
when I was a boy.

434
00:49:30,035 --> 00:49:33,444
You used to spit the seeds
at Garsiv.

435
00:49:33,628 --> 00:49:35,968
You shouldn't have brought
me here, Dastan.

436
00:49:36,106 --> 00:49:38,411
I had no choice uncle, follow me.

437
00:50:01,462 --> 00:50:05,302
I didn't kill father, you know
I'd never do such a thing..

438
00:50:05,505 --> 00:50:08,150
Your actions speak otherwise.

439
00:50:08,974 --> 00:50:11,493
I had no choice but to flee.

440
00:50:11,638 --> 00:50:13,568
Tus gave me that cloak.

441
00:50:13,688 --> 00:50:16,488
- He was the one who poisoned it. - Dastan...
- But he's not here, is he?

442
00:50:16,902 --> 00:50:19,387
At his father's funeral,
instead he remains in Alamut.

443
00:50:19,531 --> 00:50:21,731
Our allies will see
our invasion is just,

444
00:50:21,863 --> 00:50:24,345
the search for Alamut's weapon
forges is important.

445
00:50:24,488 --> 00:50:28,900
Yes, but not if there were none.
The invasion of Alamut was a lie.

446
00:50:29,128 --> 00:50:31,648
Tus is after power,
that's why he murdered father,

447
00:50:31,758 --> 00:50:35,757
and now he searches not for weapons,
but for the Sand,

448
00:50:35,967 --> 00:50:38,577
that fuels the mystical device.

449
00:50:38,726 --> 00:50:41,006
This is why you brought me here, Dastan?
Mystical devices?

450
00:50:41,147 --> 00:50:45,507
Do you remember after the battle
you stopped Tus for taken the dagger I'd won?

451
00:50:45,737 --> 00:50:49,516
That dagger is the reason he invaded Alamut.

452
00:50:49,716 --> 00:50:53,461
This dagger, you have it with you?

453
00:50:56,253 --> 00:50:58,253
Yes.

454
00:51:03,556 --> 00:51:05,876
It has incredible powers.

455
00:51:09,313 --> 00:51:11,593
Is this some sort of a joke, Dastan?

456
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:15,633
What? I know he was in there.

457
00:51:16,408 --> 00:51:19,288
And where is that so-called evidence?

458
00:51:19,449 --> 00:51:21,414
Tamina.

459
00:51:29,344 --> 00:51:31,624
- Your hands are burned.
- Yes...

460
00:51:34,018 --> 00:51:37,938
From trying to pull the poisoned cloak
of your father.

461
00:51:39,109 --> 00:51:41,308
- Is something wrong, Dastan?
- No, no.

462
00:51:41,404 --> 00:51:43,524
You're certain?
You know you can trust me, boy.

463
00:51:48,289 --> 00:51:50,894
It's just that a...

464
00:51:51,043 --> 00:51:55,323
Tus is my brother, how could
he betray me like this?

465
00:51:55,545 --> 00:52:00,190
I can't say Dastan, perhaps he never
respected you as you deserve,

466
00:52:00,433 --> 00:52:02,433
and he saw you as someone he could use.

467
00:52:02,556 --> 00:52:04,486
Someone to keep his wine glass filled.

468
00:52:04,606 --> 00:52:07,050
My service to your father was different.

469
00:52:07,192 --> 00:52:10,712
- We shared the same blood, Dastan.
- How many times did father speak

470
00:52:10,866 --> 00:52:13,865
of you saving him from that lion?

471
00:52:14,031 --> 00:52:16,956
- That was his favorite story.
- One of many, yes.

472
00:52:17,124 --> 00:52:21,324
- No, that was his favorite.
- I'm afraid you're speaking in riddles, Dastan.

473
00:52:25,428 --> 00:52:28,148
Wait, Dastan!

474
00:52:58,499 --> 00:53:00,519
Over here!

475
00:53:20,428 --> 00:53:22,427
Murderer!

476
00:53:30,443 --> 00:53:32,843
I didn't kill father!

477
00:54:42,008 --> 00:54:44,288
What you're going to do now?!

478
00:55:32,376 --> 00:55:35,016
Where is he?!

479
00:55:35,610 --> 00:55:37,149
Hey!

480
00:55:56,996 --> 00:55:58,996
Garsiv...

481
00:55:59,917 --> 00:56:03,637
- I didn't kill father.
- Then God will pardon you.

482
00:56:03,834 --> 00:56:05,919
After your head rolls.

483
00:56:15,483 --> 00:56:18,402
We don't fight with the
sticks anymore, little brother.

484
00:56:29,045 --> 00:56:31,245
That's all you got?

485
00:56:48,991 --> 00:56:52,191
Your Majesty,
I thought you were staying in Alamut.

486
00:56:52,366 --> 00:56:55,290
Tell me about Dastan, uncle.

487
00:56:56,251 --> 00:57:00,371
Dastan came to Avrat to kill me,
in the market place.

488
00:57:00,586 --> 00:57:02,551
I just got away.

489
00:57:02,637 --> 00:57:06,916
Tus, my death would weaken
your young reign.

490
00:57:07,143 --> 00:57:10,123
- Dastan hopes to start rebellion.
- He wants the throne?

491
00:57:10,253 --> 00:57:11,752
I fear so, my Lord.

492
00:57:16,115 --> 00:57:19,875
Putting Dastan on trial would give him
a stage for his sedition.

493
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:24,759
My advice would be to avoid a trial.

494
00:57:24,998 --> 00:57:28,363
Don't bring him back to Nasaf alive.

495
00:57:37,397 --> 00:57:39,162
Whatever Dastan's crimes,

496
00:57:39,275 --> 00:57:43,075
a public trial will best
communicate the king I hope to be.

497
00:57:43,276 --> 00:57:46,601
Strong, honoring the rule of law.

498
00:57:47,579 --> 00:57:51,899
- We are not savages.
- You grow more a king every day.

499
00:57:52,503 --> 00:57:56,823
Dastan must be found.
He must be brought to justice.

500
00:58:02,184 --> 00:58:05,504
HASSASINS LAIR

501
00:58:06,357 --> 00:58:09,717
- I need to speak with our guests.
- About them, my Lord,

502
00:58:09,899 --> 00:58:13,400
their practices are unusual,
the servants have seen things.

503
00:58:13,589 --> 00:58:17,057
Heard strange sounds, last
week one of the horses vanished.

504
00:58:17,248 --> 00:58:22,648
Just make sure that the servants keep
their mouths shut, or I promise you,

505
00:58:22,919 --> 00:58:25,444
they will vanish as well.

506
00:59:28,564 --> 00:59:30,769
I have another task
for you Hassansin,

507
00:59:30,901 --> 00:59:33,061
but you'll have to be quick,
your prey has a head start.

508
00:59:33,196 --> 00:59:36,756
You brought what I requested?

509
00:59:45,590 --> 00:59:48,689
These practices,
they don't interfere with your skills?

510
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:51,925
In trance we can see visions
of far future.

511
00:59:52,094 --> 00:59:54,459
Visions of death.

512
00:59:55,813 --> 01:00:00,093
Destiny and the curse.

513
01:00:06,955 --> 01:00:11,275
In the trance we can find anything,
including your nephew, prince Dastan.

514
01:00:11,498 --> 01:00:14,663
Then I hope you shall see more deaths.

515
01:00:15,301 --> 01:00:17,301
Soon.

516
01:00:54,109 --> 01:00:56,829
Get down, it's a Persian patrol.

517
01:01:08,965 --> 01:01:11,845
What aren't you telling me?

518
01:01:12,887 --> 01:01:17,927
The trail's been left, maybe they are tired
of your pawn shop for lies and backstabbing.

519
01:01:18,182 --> 01:01:20,844
I had no choice but to leave you.

520
01:01:20,996 --> 01:01:23,624
I take it your uncle didn't listen.

521
01:01:23,779 --> 01:01:27,738
It wasn't Tus that killed my father,
it was Nizam.

522
01:01:27,951 --> 01:01:31,111
- Your uncle?
- His hands were burned.

523
01:01:31,290 --> 01:01:33,650
He said it happened trying
to pull off the cloak that killed my father,

524
01:01:33,794 --> 01:01:37,674
I've gone over and over at my mind, he never
touched the cloak, he must've handled it before.

525
01:01:40,763 --> 01:01:43,727
It was Nizam who poisoned it.

526
01:01:43,892 --> 01:01:48,172
What could this turning back a few moments
of time give my uncle? None.

527
01:01:48,399 --> 01:01:51,644
He murdered my father for more
than just a dagger.

528
01:01:51,821 --> 01:01:56,741
What aren't you telling me? You know,
you've got quick hands, so do I.

529
01:01:57,455 --> 01:02:00,255
If you want it back,
you tell me everything.

530
01:02:00,412 --> 01:02:03,656
No more games,
no more lies.

531
01:02:13,103 --> 01:02:15,303
Can we get out of here?

532
01:02:21,449 --> 01:02:26,128
Oh...only a princess thinks
she can outrun a sandstorm.

533
01:02:31,047 --> 01:02:34,047
Nizam is coming to kill us,
he needs me dead.

534
01:02:35,345 --> 01:02:37,905
I need to know why.

535
01:02:41,771 --> 01:02:46,691
In Alamut rests the beating heart
of all life on earth.

536
01:02:46,940 --> 01:02:50,105
The Sand Glass of the gods.

537
01:02:50,868 --> 01:02:55,908
Long ago, the gods slipped down on man
and saw nothing but greed and treachery.

538
01:02:56,163 --> 01:03:01,167
So they sent a great sandstorm,
to destroy all, wipe clean the face of the earth.

539
01:03:01,425 --> 01:03:05,705
<i>But one young girl begged the gods
to give mankind another chance.</i>

540
01:03:05,927 --> 01:03:08,577
<i>Offering her life in exchange.</i>

541
01:03:08,728 --> 01:03:14,608
Seeing the purity within, the gods were
reminded of men's potentials for good.

542
01:03:14,899 --> 01:03:18,864
So they swept the sand into the Sand Glass.

543
01:03:34,350 --> 01:03:37,950
The Dagger was given to the girl
who saved Man.

544
01:03:38,148 --> 01:03:40,392
<i>Making her the first guardian.</i>

545
01:03:40,526 --> 01:03:43,926
<i>The Dagger blade is the only thing
that can pierce the Sand Glass</i>

546
01:03:44,109 --> 01:03:48,559
and remove the Sands of Time,
but the handle only holds one minute.

547
01:03:48,788 --> 01:03:51,448
But if one were to place a Dagger
in the Sand Glass, and pressed the

548
01:03:51,565 --> 01:03:53,064
jewel button at the same time?

549
01:03:53,170 --> 01:03:56,250
- Sand would flow through endlessly.
- You could turn back time as far as you like.

550
01:03:56,420 --> 01:03:59,184
Yes, but it is forbidden.

551
01:04:05,647 --> 01:04:10,367
When my father was a boy,
Nizam saved his life hunting.

552
01:04:12,032 --> 01:04:15,032
<i>One day the two princes
were stalking a beautiful buck,</i>

553
01:04:15,198 --> 01:04:18,127
<i>but they weren't aware of a lion
stalking them.</i>

554
01:04:18,291 --> 01:04:24,091
<i>Nizam saved Sharaman.
My father told us the story over and over again.</i>

555
01:04:24,378 --> 01:04:26,823
I don't understand.

556
01:04:26,971 --> 01:04:30,771
Nizam wishes to go back in time
and undo what he did.

557
01:04:30,972 --> 01:04:33,417
Not save my father,
let him die.

558
01:04:33,559 --> 01:04:36,648
Then he will be king for a lifetime.

559
01:04:36,818 --> 01:04:39,978
And my brothers would never be born.

560
01:04:46,375 --> 01:04:48,655
The storm's passed.

561
01:05:16,587 --> 01:05:21,627
Dastan, the Sands contained within
the Sand Glass are incredibly powerful.

562
01:05:24,933 --> 01:05:29,453
Opening the Dagger while it's
inside the glass breaks the seal

563
01:05:29,685 --> 01:05:33,415
and destroys the Sand Glass,
causing it to crack and shatter.

564
01:05:33,613 --> 01:05:36,577
The Sands of Time would no
longer be contained,

565
01:05:36,742 --> 01:05:39,562
and they would carry
the gods' wrath with them once more,

566
01:05:39,685 --> 01:05:42,584
destroying everything in their path.

567
01:05:45,714 --> 01:05:49,394
And all of mankind would pay
for Nizam's treachery.

568
01:05:50,805 --> 01:05:54,289
This is all that would be left of us.

569
01:05:54,477 --> 01:05:58,077
The secret guardian temple outside
Alamut is the sanctuary.

570
01:05:58,269 --> 01:06:00,839
The one place where the Dagger
can be hidden safely,

571
01:06:00,987 --> 01:06:03,627
the only way to stop this Armageddon.

572
01:06:04,910 --> 01:06:08,110
That's the truth, Dastan.

573
01:06:08,874 --> 01:06:14,473
Give me back the Dagger, so that
I can take it there.

574
01:06:16,510 --> 01:06:19,190
I can't do that.

575
01:06:22,102 --> 01:06:26,742
- I'm coming with you.
- You're going to help me!

576
01:06:28,362 --> 01:06:31,802
We can sit here and chat,
or you can get on the horse.

577
01:06:47,474 --> 01:06:49,639
Our journey is blessed.

578
01:06:49,769 --> 01:06:53,488
We'll stop for the water and push
for the mountain's pass by the nightfall.

579
01:06:54,776 --> 01:06:59,056
- You enjoy telling me what to do.
- Only because you are so good at following orders.

580
01:06:59,283 --> 01:07:01,643
Don't press your luck.

581
01:07:15,098 --> 01:07:17,098
Persian!

582
01:07:17,226 --> 01:07:22,386
We parted under certain rush circumstances,
I didn't get a chance to say goodbye.

583
01:07:23,695 --> 01:07:26,060
We've been tracking you for a week.

584
01:07:26,199 --> 01:07:29,879
That little riot you started,
it went on for two days!

585
01:07:31,206 --> 01:07:36,286
My beloved racetrack,
all washed away like the footprints in sand.

586
01:07:36,542 --> 01:07:38,672
See Lita there...
Look at her?

587
01:07:38,801 --> 01:07:40,881
She's all that's left
of my gaming empire.

588
01:07:41,012 --> 01:07:44,172
And no matter
your skills as a promoter,

589
01:07:44,351 --> 01:07:49,350
you can't organize an ostrich race
with just one ostrich!

590
01:07:49,603 --> 01:07:51,933
Am I right?!

591
01:07:52,070 --> 01:07:55,150
Yes sir, come with me.

592
01:08:01,251 --> 01:08:04,851
Did you know that the ostriches
have suicidal tendencies?

593
01:08:05,925 --> 01:08:08,405
Look at this poor thing.

594
01:08:08,554 --> 01:08:12,453
She used to be a grand champion,
and now I have to watch her

595
01:08:12,659 --> 01:08:16,524
night and day to make sure
she doesn't do anything stupid.

596
01:08:22,116 --> 01:08:25,756
Suddenly occurred to me, that the only way
to recoup my tragic losses,

597
01:08:25,950 --> 01:08:29,519
was to track down the two young lovers
who cast this dark cloud upon me.

598
01:08:29,710 --> 01:08:34,910
Oh yes, I'm gonna need the prize on your head,
your brother will be very pleased to see...

599
01:08:38,682 --> 01:08:41,162
The sand dervishes Persian,
they are common as camel dirt...

600
01:08:41,271 --> 01:08:42,870
Sheik Amar, listen to me...!

601
01:08:43,565 --> 01:08:46,450
- I'd rather not.
- Nice knife.

602
01:08:46,611 --> 01:08:49,575
Noble Sheik, we are on the
sacred journey to the temple...

603
01:08:49,740 --> 01:08:53,740
Temple, the temple, there is nothing
more sacred than Persian's gold.

604
01:09:41,903 --> 01:09:44,223
Give me the Dagger,
there are too many of them.

605
01:09:46,409 --> 01:09:49,089
You can't kill them all,
you wanna live, give me the Dagger!!

606
01:10:08,818 --> 01:10:11,218
Give me the Dagger!

607
01:10:24,674 --> 01:10:27,754
Persian, how did you do that?

608
01:10:30,392 --> 01:10:32,632
Instinct.

609
01:10:34,273 --> 01:10:36,473
What?

610
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:48,047
We have to get out of here.

611
01:10:50,255 --> 01:10:54,015
- What happened last night?
- Those vipers were controlled by Hassansins.

612
01:10:54,219 --> 01:10:56,384
- Hassansins?
- For years they were the covert

613
01:10:56,515 --> 01:10:59,315
killing force for the Persian kings,
for my father ordered them disbanded.

614
01:10:59,472 --> 01:11:03,596
Nizam must've disobeyed my father's orders
and kept them intact.

615
01:11:03,817 --> 01:11:07,197
This is a secret government killing society.
That's why I don't pay taxes!

616
01:11:07,380 --> 01:11:10,725
- We can't stop.
- Oh perhaps you can't, but we can.

617
01:11:10,911 --> 01:11:13,911
We could use your help
getting to the temple.

618
01:11:14,077 --> 01:11:16,407
Hah, by crossing the Hindu Kush
with the storm blowing?

619
01:11:16,545 --> 01:11:19,745
You attract troubles like flies around
rotting mango and your insane...

620
01:11:19,884 --> 01:11:21,882
There's gold at the temple.

621
01:11:22,005 --> 01:11:24,650
More than ten horses can carry.

622
01:11:24,801 --> 01:11:27,966
- Tax-free.
- Sir!

623
01:11:57,523 --> 01:12:02,322
- Do you have any idea where you're going?
- I memorized this path as a child.

624
01:12:02,566 --> 01:12:06,531
Every princess must, it's sacred.

625
01:12:09,290 --> 01:12:12,210
It's here.

626
01:12:19,555 --> 01:12:23,955
The sanctuary, the one place the Dagger
can be hidden safely.

627
01:12:24,182 --> 01:12:27,747
I was expecting golden statues, waterfalls.

628
01:12:31,741 --> 01:12:36,061
Give me back the Dagger, so that
I can take it there.

629
01:12:53,566 --> 01:12:56,646
Don't cut yourself, princess.

630
01:13:01,702 --> 01:13:03,702
Hey, here!

631
01:13:06,460 --> 01:13:10,300
Not long dead, last night maybe.
Tortured first.

632
01:13:10,502 --> 01:13:14,067
- Hassansin.
- Nizam knows this place.

633
01:13:14,258 --> 01:13:16,982
All dead.

634
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:21,515
- The entire village, about my gold...
- Where are you going?!

635
01:13:22,150 --> 01:13:24,115
- There is only one way to stop all of this.
- What?!

636
01:13:24,236 --> 01:13:27,836
To make sure the Dagger is safe,
the temple holds the stone the Dagger came from.

637
01:13:28,029 --> 01:13:30,239
What temple? This is
a pile of stones and rocks!

638
01:13:30,371 --> 01:13:33,271
The first thing we learned, if all else fails,
put the Dagger back into the stone,

639
01:13:33,397 --> 01:13:38,295
the stone will envelop it, pulling it
into the mountain, returning to the gods.

640
01:13:46,019 --> 01:13:53,384
- The original promise, must be paid.
- What promise?

641
01:13:53,739 --> 01:13:57,458
The gods must take back
the life they spared.

642
01:13:58,245 --> 01:14:00,445
You'll die.

643
01:14:10,222 --> 01:14:13,022
- Stay there! Stay there!
- Listen to me! Listen to me!

644
01:14:14,396 --> 01:14:17,760
Give me your sword, give me your sword
or do you fortake given that honor.

645
01:14:17,942 --> 01:14:20,862
There are bodies down there,
murdered by Hassansins, on Nizam's order!

646
01:14:21,025 --> 01:14:23,750
- He's the traitor!
- Hassansins no longer exist!

647
01:14:23,909 --> 01:14:26,389
- You always thought you are so clever.
- This is no trick, Garsiv.

648
01:14:26,533 --> 01:14:30,898
Sir, all dead inside Sir,
more in the village.

649
01:14:31,124 --> 01:14:33,809
- There is only one way...
- Stay there!

650
01:14:38,181 --> 01:14:40,821
Nizam wants me dead,
wants me silenced.

651
01:14:40,971 --> 01:14:43,576
A trial will be too public.

652
01:14:47,862 --> 01:14:50,347
Do you know this?
He said this much, didn't he?

653
01:14:50,491 --> 01:14:53,970
I know it hasn't been easy
between us Garsiv, but still...

654
01:14:54,455 --> 01:14:55,735
we are brothers.

655
01:14:55,791 --> 01:14:57,790
Touching words
with my sword at your throat.

656
01:14:57,919 --> 01:15:00,964
You've often questioned why
father has been so much time in prayer.

657
01:15:01,132 --> 01:15:02,123
Before he died,
he told me that the bond

658
01:15:02,167 --> 01:15:05,175
between brothers
is the sword that defends our empire.

659
01:15:05,342 --> 01:15:07,787
He was praying that
that sword remains strong.

660
01:15:07,934 --> 01:15:11,894
Why would I go into Avrat for father's
funeral, when I knew it was so dangerous?

661
01:15:20,202 --> 01:15:22,202
Nizam recommended your death,

662
01:15:22,331 --> 01:15:24,976
Tus disagreed, ordered
you brought back alive.

663
01:15:25,127 --> 01:15:30,127
Nizam wants me dead, and he's hired
Hassansins to make sure that does happen.

664
01:15:30,380 --> 01:15:33,744
He's afraid of what I might say,

665
01:15:33,926 --> 01:15:36,971
and who I might tell.

666
01:15:40,483 --> 01:15:43,243
Tell me, brother.

667
01:15:45,783 --> 01:15:47,783
Garsiv?

668
01:15:52,041 --> 01:15:54,041
My Garsiv?

669
01:15:58,092 --> 01:16:00,492
Hassansins!

670
01:16:18,832 --> 01:16:20,832
Shut up!

671
01:16:32,936 --> 01:16:35,016
Protect the Dagger!

672
01:16:51,506 --> 01:16:53,626
Persian, behind you!

673
01:17:04,025 --> 01:17:06,705
Tamina!

674
01:17:06,863 --> 01:17:09,862
Forget them, throw these!

675
01:17:10,028 --> 01:17:12,753
Find her!

676
01:17:20,425 --> 01:17:22,670
Hey! Over here!

677
01:17:22,803 --> 01:17:25,603
You know what they say about men
with big swords!

678
01:17:39,704 --> 01:17:42,304
Tamina, let me do it.

679
01:17:43,376 --> 01:17:46,476
Only a guardian can return the Dagger.

680
01:17:46,647 --> 01:17:49,711
This isn't something you can do, Dastan.

681
01:17:50,970 --> 01:17:54,570
I'm ready for this.

682
01:17:54,763 --> 01:17:57,848
I'm not.

683
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Tamina!

684
01:19:04,205 --> 01:19:07,005
Out, enough, out!

685
01:19:25,612 --> 01:19:27,612
Garsiv!

686
01:19:27,991 --> 01:19:30,471
Dastan, I'm sorry.

687
01:19:33,625 --> 01:19:36,825
Save the empire.

688
01:19:38,716 --> 01:19:41,916
Brother... Brother.

689
01:19:46,143 --> 01:19:50,223
- Where is the Dagger?
- It's gone.

690
01:19:51,652 --> 01:19:56,452
Protect the Dagger, no matter the
consequences, that was my sacred calling.

691
01:19:57,119 --> 01:19:59,999
That was my destiny.

692
01:20:05,339 --> 01:20:08,739
We make our own destiny, princess.

693
01:20:08,923 --> 01:20:11,488
We'll get it back.

694
01:20:43,313 --> 01:20:46,033
We're going to need another horse!

695
01:20:48,237 --> 01:20:51,517
- Where will you go?
- To Alamut.

696
01:20:54,789 --> 01:20:59,189
Nizam will use that Dagger to pierce
the Sand Glass, and he has to be stopped.

697
01:20:59,415 --> 01:21:02,700
He has to be stopped.
He has to be stopped.

698
01:21:05,763 --> 01:21:07,763
What?

699
01:21:08,851 --> 01:21:11,891
Oh, a knife thrower with a conscience.

700
01:21:31,803 --> 01:21:33,803
Our friends in the palace said
that the Persians have broken through

701
01:21:33,890 --> 01:21:35,889
to the first level of the tunnels.

702
01:21:36,017 --> 01:21:38,661
They will reach the Sand Glass
within hours.

703
01:21:38,812 --> 01:21:42,972
Nizam's keeping the Dagger in the high
temple, guarded by some sort of demon,

704
01:21:43,189 --> 01:21:47,314
- covered in spikes.
- The Hassansin that killed my brother.

705
01:21:47,529 --> 01:21:50,939
It's the only thing that stands between
us and the Dagger.

706
01:21:51,123 --> 01:21:54,123
No man can stand within
twenty yards of him and live.

707
01:21:54,290 --> 01:21:58,054
Some don't need to get that close.

708
01:22:17,704 --> 01:22:20,024
Spare some water, sire.

709
01:22:28,471 --> 01:22:30,571
You sure about this?

710
01:22:30,698 --> 01:22:32,728
I owed the boy.

711
01:22:32,853 --> 01:22:35,817
But, you are a M'Baka, scourge of
the Namibian plain.

712
01:22:35,982 --> 01:22:38,702
Me, I'm a slightly dishonorable
entrepreneur, this...

713
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:41,819
nobility business
is not the cloth we're cut from.

714
01:22:41,986 --> 01:22:43,916
Hurry.

715
01:22:44,036 --> 01:22:49,516
My friend, has anyone ever told you
that you talk too much?

716
01:22:56,346 --> 01:22:58,346
Come on.

717
01:25:45,642 --> 01:25:48,641
Have I told you about the M'Baka?

718
01:25:49,815 --> 01:25:53,735
- Yes, you have.
- I hope your brother listens to you, Persian.

719
01:26:02,543 --> 01:26:04,508
He's here.

720
01:26:04,629 --> 01:26:08,428
Seal every gate!
Find him!

721
01:26:41,685 --> 01:26:43,765
- It's clear.
- Dastan, I don't...

722
01:26:45,316 --> 01:26:47,835
I don't think you should do this.

723
01:26:47,980 --> 01:26:50,442
Is that concern I hear?

724
01:26:50,585 --> 01:26:53,013
- Caution.
- Sprinkled with concern.

725
01:26:53,160 --> 01:26:58,640
- You flatter yourself, prince.
- And you used to be a better liar, princess.

726
01:26:58,914 --> 01:27:02,044
Perhaps I'm out of practice.

727
01:27:02,216 --> 01:27:05,895
This won't be the last time
we'll be together.

728
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:19,760
- Where is the Dagger?
- You Persian bureaucrats, such soft hands.

729
01:27:28,839 --> 01:27:33,119
- It's been found, my Lord.
- The Sand Glass?

730
01:27:34,848 --> 01:27:37,248
I don't have the Dagger.

731
01:27:38,604 --> 01:27:40,604
Leave me.

732
01:27:41,441 --> 01:27:43,521
Hello, Tus.

733
01:27:43,653 --> 01:27:45,852
Dastan!

734
01:27:46,657 --> 01:27:48,997
- We need to talk.
- Then talk!

735
01:27:49,135 --> 01:27:53,440
- Alone.
- Wait outside the chamber, now!

736
01:27:55,713 --> 01:27:58,113
We are brothers, did you know?

737
01:27:59,385 --> 01:28:01,385
The robe that killed father
was poisoned by Nizam.

738
01:28:01,508 --> 01:28:04,992
- Nizam? You are mad.
- Who gave you the robe, Tus?

739
01:28:05,180 --> 01:28:07,510
Who gave you the robe?!

740
01:28:07,647 --> 01:28:11,727
You trust him, as did I, but Alamut
wasn't supplying our enemies with weapons.

741
01:28:11,940 --> 01:28:14,185
- Nizam lied to us.
- Why he would do such a thing,

742
01:28:14,324 --> 01:28:17,969
- what could he gain?
- Listen to me carefully.

743
01:28:18,163 --> 01:28:20,643
Beneath the streets of this city
lies an ancient force,

744
01:28:20,792 --> 01:28:24,236
a container, holding
the fabled Sands of Time.

745
01:28:24,422 --> 01:28:26,502
Nizam wishes to use it
to corrupt history,

746
01:28:26,634 --> 01:28:29,634
he wants to turn back time
and make himself king.

747
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:32,130
Sands of Time?

748
01:28:32,268 --> 01:28:34,433
Heresies Dastan, pagan madness.

749
01:28:34,563 --> 01:28:37,323
I've seen its power with my own eyes, Tus.

750
01:28:37,484 --> 01:28:41,764
Nizam discovered its resting place, and if
we don't stop him our world could end.

751
01:28:41,985 --> 01:28:45,950
If you're gonna kill me, the best
you do it now.

752
01:28:51,463 --> 01:28:53,908
This is no ordinary dagger.

753
01:28:54,050 --> 01:28:58,530
You press the jewel on its hilt,
and you'll see.

754
01:29:00,727 --> 01:29:03,526
I should have the strength
to do this before we invaded the city.

755
01:29:03,684 --> 01:29:08,249
- What are you talking about?
- To act of what I know is right.

756
01:29:08,483 --> 01:29:10,528
No matter the consequences.

757
01:29:21,508 --> 01:29:24,588
- The soldiers remain out...
- Stay where you are!

758
01:29:31,189 --> 01:29:33,154
He took his own life.

759
01:29:33,276 --> 01:29:36,996
Then, God have mercy on the traitor,
for he chose the path of the coward.

760
01:29:38,075 --> 01:29:40,354
We both know Dastan was many things,

761
01:29:40,495 --> 01:29:43,775
but not... a coward.

762
01:29:45,794 --> 01:29:51,394
<i>This is no ordinary dagger. Press
the jewel on its hilt, and you'll see.</i>

763
01:30:12,168 --> 01:30:14,608
No matter the consequences.

764
01:30:14,750 --> 01:30:17,160
Stop!

765
01:30:17,301 --> 01:30:20,900
A moment ago you died
before my eyes.

766
01:30:21,765 --> 01:30:24,885
- Oh, you pressed it.
- How did you know I would?

767
01:30:26,689 --> 01:30:29,569
Cause we are brothers.

768
01:30:33,283 --> 01:30:34,363
The day we left for war,

769
01:30:34,431 --> 01:30:39,010
our father told me a true king
considers the advice of the counsel.

770
01:30:39,244 --> 01:30:42,974
But always listens to his heart.

771
01:30:43,172 --> 01:30:46,372
You shouldn't defy to go so far
for me to believe you.

772
01:30:46,547 --> 01:30:49,712
Your Majesty,
the soldiers tell me that...

773
01:30:51,519 --> 01:30:54,439
I see that Dastan
has indeed return.

774
01:30:57,026 --> 01:30:59,146
Tus, remember what I told you!

775
01:31:04,580 --> 01:31:06,660
No, a moment.

776
01:31:07,668 --> 01:31:11,388
Poor Tus, so eager for the crown.

777
01:31:12,801 --> 01:31:16,680
And you, Dastan,
always charging in,

778
01:31:16,889 --> 01:31:20,529
so desperate to prove
you are more than

779
01:31:20,723 --> 01:31:24,328
something that king
scraped of the street.

780
01:31:25,444 --> 01:31:28,404
What a glorious mess we are.

781
01:31:29,284 --> 01:31:31,849
It seems that bond between brothers,

782
01:31:31,996 --> 01:31:35,475
is no longer the sword
that defends our empire.

783
01:31:36,168 --> 01:31:37,648
Yes!

784
01:32:00,163 --> 01:32:02,763
He was one of us.

785
01:32:04,670 --> 01:32:07,315
He was the priest of the temple.

786
01:32:07,466 --> 01:32:10,786
That's how Nizam discovered
the existence of the Sand Glass.

787
01:32:10,966 --> 01:32:13,811
He corrupted the guardians,
infected us.

788
01:32:13,970 --> 01:32:16,935
We are no longer pure.

789
01:32:17,689 --> 01:32:20,009
We must hurry.

790
01:32:27,288 --> 01:32:29,253
Pulley.

791
01:32:29,374 --> 01:32:31,854
Get pulley, now!

792
01:32:35,007 --> 01:32:39,007
The guardians built passageways underneath
the city, a secret access to the Sand Glass.

793
01:32:39,217 --> 01:32:41,782
If we move fast enough,
we can get there before Nizam.

794
01:33:08,182 --> 01:33:11,302
That would be the stand
to the Sand Glass chamber.

795
01:33:11,474 --> 01:33:14,398
There is only one safe path.

796
01:33:14,775 --> 01:33:17,855
Faster!

797
01:33:35,306 --> 01:33:38,026
Follow in my footsteps.

798
01:33:40,105 --> 01:33:43,825
Nothing can touch the surface,
other than where I step.

799
01:34:05,352 --> 01:34:07,352
Run, Dastan!
Run!

800
01:34:17,369 --> 01:34:19,529
Dastan!

801
01:37:04,453 --> 01:37:06,453
Nizam!

802
01:37:08,627 --> 01:37:12,347
You murdered your own family.
Sharaman was your brother!

803
01:37:12,544 --> 01:37:14,789
And my curse.

804
01:37:16,973 --> 01:37:19,693
I looked up to you.

805
01:37:21,396 --> 01:37:22,475
Dastan!

806
01:37:22,543 --> 01:37:26,923
I never understood, why
my brother brought trash into the palace.

807
01:37:27,149 --> 01:37:29,599
Enjoy the gutter, Dastan.

808
01:37:29,742 --> 01:37:32,702
It's where you stay under my reign.

809
01:37:42,761 --> 01:37:44,841
Tamina!

810
01:37:45,348 --> 01:37:48,548
Nizam, don't use the Dagger
to undo your past!

811
01:37:48,729 --> 01:37:51,369
- It will unleash...
- Unleash, what?!

812
01:37:51,519 --> 01:37:54,124
Gods' wrath?!
Hell itself?!

813
01:37:58,619 --> 01:38:01,418
Don't do this!

814
01:38:15,394 --> 01:38:18,514
Stop him! If the glass
shatters, the world dies with it.

815
01:38:20,109 --> 01:38:24,709
It's not my destiny, it's yours.
It always has been.

816
01:38:24,944 --> 01:38:27,474
- Let me go.
- I won't.

817
01:38:27,620 --> 01:38:30,700
- Let me go.
- I'm not letting you go!

818
01:38:30,875 --> 01:38:34,835
I wish we could have been together.

819
01:38:41,516 --> 01:38:45,116
- Dastan!
- No! Tamina!

820
01:39:16,569 --> 01:39:21,068
- Dastan!
- Tamina!

821
01:40:35,729 --> 01:40:37,729
Prince, Dastan!

822
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:42,960
- Bis, you're here?
- Of course I'm here.

823
01:40:43,533 --> 01:40:47,053
Our men surrounded Alamut's palace,
battle is over.

824
01:40:47,242 --> 01:40:49,527
Not yet.

825
01:40:57,303 --> 01:41:00,023
Wait!

826
01:41:03,396 --> 01:41:05,396
Wait!

827
01:41:12,577 --> 01:41:17,776
Brave soldiers of Persia, we have been
deceived into attacking this holy city!

828
01:41:18,038 --> 01:41:22,163
- Alamut, has no weapon forges!
- Dastan!

829
01:41:23,593 --> 01:41:27,193
- Have you gone mad?
- I cannot stand silent in the face of treachery.

830
01:41:27,391 --> 01:41:31,291
This war was set up by one
trusted above all us.

831
01:41:31,496 --> 01:41:35,360
- Our uncle Nizam.
- Dastan has fought hard today,

832
01:41:35,564 --> 01:41:38,686
perhaps too hard. What he needs now
is to get out from under this

833
01:41:38,858 --> 01:41:41,862
burning sun, to rest.
Gather his wits.

834
01:41:42,028 --> 01:41:44,712
The weapons we've found
are forgeries!

835
01:41:44,865 --> 01:41:47,480
There are no weapons here uncle,
and you know it!

836
01:41:47,630 --> 01:41:50,990
And the spy, who supposedly
intercepted them, was hired by you,

837
01:41:51,177 --> 01:41:54,456
to persuade all of us,
to invade Alamut!

838
01:41:54,634 --> 01:41:57,164
What is this, Dastan?
Victor's remorse?

839
01:41:57,310 --> 01:42:00,430
You yourself led the attack,
brought us this great triumph.

840
01:42:02,235 --> 01:42:05,515
I should never have
let the attack happen.

841
01:42:07,242 --> 01:42:10,202
I knew in my heart that it was wrong.

842
01:42:12,666 --> 01:42:15,111
It will never be you.

843
01:42:15,254 --> 01:42:19,294
You'll never been king,
you don't have the heart.

844
01:42:19,505 --> 01:42:23,510
You will die
in a shadow of a great man.

845
01:42:28,399 --> 01:42:31,318
Get him down from there, before
he makes even bigger fool of himself!

846
01:42:31,518 --> 01:42:35,413
Tus, before we left Nasaf,
father told you this:

847
01:42:35,618 --> 01:42:37,198
"That the true king, considers
the advice of the counsel,

848
01:42:37,267 --> 01:42:41,166
but he always
listens to his own heart."

849
01:42:41,627 --> 01:42:44,112
Father and I were alone.
How could you know that?

850
01:42:44,256 --> 01:42:47,856
He's right, he knows us and
he knows we are capable of.

851
01:42:48,049 --> 01:42:51,013
- Just listen to your heart.
- He defies your order,

852
01:42:51,177 --> 01:42:55,142
leads attack and now wants
to turn back, Tus...

853
01:42:55,815 --> 01:42:59,015
Take action here.

854
01:43:10,670 --> 01:43:13,435
The spy knows the truth,
find the spy!

855
01:43:13,592 --> 01:43:16,952
Bring him to me,
we'll wring it from him.

856
01:43:54,236 --> 01:43:56,476
You had what every man
could ever dream,

857
01:43:56,610 --> 01:44:00,335
love, respect and family.

858
01:44:01,330 --> 01:44:04,250
But that wasn't enough for you, was it?

859
01:44:40,389 --> 01:44:43,069
Princess of Alamut.

860
01:44:43,728 --> 01:44:46,607
I was misled to attack your city.

861
01:44:47,482 --> 01:44:49,927
Forgive me, Your Highness.

862
01:44:50,070 --> 01:44:53,470
Let me try to make amends?

863
01:45:00,711 --> 01:45:03,071
It would be to our mutual advantage,

864
01:45:03,210 --> 01:45:07,494
that our nations be united
by a bond stronger than friendship.

865
01:45:08,097 --> 01:45:10,617
Marriage.

866
01:45:11,143 --> 01:45:16,623
Your marriage to one who is both
conqueror and savior of your city.

867
01:45:21,367 --> 01:45:23,532
Dastan.

868
01:45:23,663 --> 01:45:27,142
Royal blood or not,
he's every bit a son to our father.

869
01:45:27,334 --> 01:45:30,314
Every bit a brother to Garsiv and me.

870
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:33,425
The true prince of Persia.

871
01:45:37,725 --> 01:45:40,925
Get up there,
before I take your place.

872
01:45:45,904 --> 01:45:48,184
Hello, princess.

873
01:45:49,659 --> 01:45:53,799
It's a customary to accompany
a proposal with gifts but, uh...

874
01:45:54,015 --> 01:45:58,120
I was surprised and unless I'm unprepared.

875
01:45:58,334 --> 01:46:01,984
I've nothing for you, save...

876
01:46:02,179 --> 01:46:05,858
that which is already yours.

877
01:46:16,784 --> 01:46:20,544
Walk with me, prince Dastan.

878
01:46:28,134 --> 01:46:31,534
How can I trust the man who
breached the walls of my city?

879
01:46:31,718 --> 01:46:35,163
But I'm starting to think that I'm no longer
the same man who breached those walls.

880
01:46:35,354 --> 01:46:38,354
That's a short time for
the man to change so much.

881
01:46:38,520 --> 01:46:41,044
Perhaps.

882
01:46:43,907 --> 01:46:46,447
It sounds as
if you've discovered something here.

883
01:46:46,594 --> 01:46:51,099
- What might that be?
- The new spiritual awareness.

884
01:46:51,330 --> 01:46:54,460
- A destiny.
- Yes, exactly.

885
01:46:54,632 --> 01:46:57,832
I believe we make
our own destiny, princess.

886
01:46:58,008 --> 01:47:00,337
You have an unfortunate lack of curiosity.

887
01:47:00,474 --> 01:47:03,874
- With no doubt, one of my many flaws.
- Please don't mock me, prince.

888
01:47:06,108 --> 01:47:09,708
I hardly think we know each other
well enough for that, princess.

889
01:47:09,900 --> 01:47:13,785
But I look forward,
to the day that we do.
