1
00:00:48,174 --> 00:00:50,224
This is

2
00:00:50,385 --> 00:00:55,635
the story of a puppy.

3
00:00:55,807 --> 00:00:59,387
His name is

4
00:00:59,561 --> 00:01:01,521
El-i

5
00:01:02,188 --> 00:01:03,888
Elliot.
Elliot.

6
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,360
His name is Elliot.

7
00:01:06,526 --> 00:01:07,736
You got it.

8
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:10,912
He is going on an

9
00:01:11,072 --> 00:01:13,872
adventure

10
00:01:14,033 --> 00:01:15,133
An adventure.

11
00:01:15,157 --> 00:01:16,160
What's that?

12
00:01:16,161 --> 00:01:17,451
An adventure?

13
00:01:17,637 --> 00:01:19,077
You don't know what an adventure is?

14
00:01:19,497 --> 00:01:20,867
What we're on right now.

15
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,920
Out here in the wild,

16
00:01:23,001 --> 00:01:25,631
not another soul in sight
for hundreds of miles,

17
00:01:25,837 --> 00:01:27,667
with just the stars to guide us.

18
00:01:27,839 --> 00:01:29,719
Is it scary?

19
00:01:30,367 --> 00:01:32,627
Well, that's the other thing about adventures.

20
00:01:32,794 --> 00:01:34,164
You gotta be brave.

21
00:01:34,429 --> 00:01:35,889
Are you brave?

22
00:01:36,255 --> 00:01:37,545
Of course you are.

23
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:42,399
I think you are the bravest boy
I've ever met.

24
00:02:11,633 --> 00:02:12,883
Momma.

25
00:04:15,006 --> 00:04:17,066
Are you gonna eat me?

26
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:02,697
<font color="#00ffff"><i>As long as people have been
going into these woods,</i></font>

27
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:05,675
<font color="#00ffff"><i>there have been stories
about the Millhaven dragon.</i></font>

28
00:07:07,178 --> 00:07:08,928
<font color="#00ffff"><i>How does that song go again?</i></font>

29
00:07:09,013 --> 00:07:10,353
<font color="#00ffff"><i>They come from the North, right?</i></font>

30
00:07:10,515 --> 00:07:13,814
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Way up there in the mountains
where few people have ever been.</i></font>

31
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:15,346
<font color="#00ffff"><i>But sometimes,</i></font>

32
00:07:15,478 --> 00:07:17,648
<font color="#00ffff"><i>a dragon gets lost from its family</i></font>

33
00:07:17,814 --> 00:07:20,824
<font color="#00ffff"><i>and winds up very, very far from home.</i></font>

34
00:07:20,983 --> 00:07:24,573
<font color="#00ffff"><i>They say it lives in these very woods.</i></font>

35
00:07:24,737 --> 00:07:27,197
<font color="#00ffff"><i>That you can hear its roar at night.</i></font>

36
00:07:27,657 --> 00:07:31,757
<font color="#00ffff"><i>They say this, they say that,
but, as far as I know...</i></font>

37
00:07:32,328 --> 00:07:35,928
<font color="#00ffff"><i>not one soul has ever
actually seen this dragon.</i></font>

38
00:07:36,499 --> 00:07:37,959
Except me.

39
00:07:38,042 --> 00:07:39,592
You saw a dragon?

40
00:07:39,752 --> 00:07:41,002
I sure did.

41
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:44,422
I sure did.

42
00:07:45,216 --> 00:07:46,216
What'd it look like?

43
00:07:46,384 --> 00:07:47,434
Well, it was green.

44
00:07:47,844 --> 00:07:49,104
Green all over.

45
00:07:49,578 --> 00:07:51,338
Except for his eyes.

46
00:07:52,531 --> 00:07:54,171
His eyes were red.

47
00:07:54,295 --> 00:07:55,684
Like hellfire.

48
00:07:55,885 --> 00:07:57,385
Before I could even blink,

49
00:07:57,653 --> 00:07:59,363
it rears back its head,

50
00:07:59,988 --> 00:08:01,973
opens its mighty jaw,

51
00:08:02,141 --> 00:08:03,141
and shoots out.

52
00:08:06,362 --> 00:08:08,246
So, I wasn't gonna waste my breath I...

53
00:08:08,647 --> 00:08:11,777
rolled out the way, scrambled to my feet
ready for the fight that was gonna come.

54
00:08:12,101 --> 00:08:13,601
But as I raised my rifle

55
00:08:13,769 --> 00:08:16,139
the dragon comes at me
with one swipe of its claw

56
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:17,599
knocks the gun right out of my hands.

57
00:08:17,623 --> 00:08:18,623
Now, now what?

58
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:20,691
Things are really not looking good here.

59
00:08:21,377 --> 00:08:24,207
But I wasn't gonna be done. Not yet.

60
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:26,882
I just took out my pocket knife.

61
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:29,749
And as the dragon set upon me,

62
00:08:32,263 --> 00:08:33,363
I drove it home.

63
00:08:34,891 --> 00:08:36,561
Scaring the kids again, Dad?

64
00:08:36,826 --> 00:08:38,906
No, no, no.
I was just giving them a leg up

65
00:08:38,978 --> 00:08:40,608
on what's out there in those woods.

66
00:08:41,114 --> 00:08:43,784
Well, I'm out in those woods every day

67
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:47,150
and while I have seen bears and bobcats

68
00:08:47,174 --> 00:08:50,019
and just about every type
of bird you can imagine.

69
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:53,489
I have never seen a dragon.

70
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:57,582
Just because you don't see something,
doesn't mean it's not there.

71
00:08:57,847 --> 00:08:59,767
And just because you say it's true,

72
00:09:00,049 --> 00:09:01,219
doesn't mean it is.

73
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,750
But, I'm headed out there right now.

74
00:09:04,921 --> 00:09:09,091
I'll let you all know if I see anything
big and green and breathing fire.

75
00:09:10,593 --> 00:09:12,603
Mr. Meacham, I believe you.

76
00:09:12,762 --> 00:09:14,162
Well, I'm glad you do.

77
00:09:14,986 --> 00:09:16,147
See, my daughter,

78
00:09:16,148 --> 00:09:17,528
she knows a thing or two but

79
00:09:17,535 --> 00:09:19,725
only if it's staring at her in the face.

80
00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:22,867
If you go through life only seeing
what's right in front of you

81
00:09:22,939 --> 00:09:24,479
you're gonna miss out on a whole lot.

82
00:09:25,608 --> 00:09:28,278
See, and that's where
you guys have the upper hand.

83
00:09:29,111 --> 00:09:32,863
Because mark my words
that dragon is still out there.

84
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,160
And if you were to go
out there to those woods

85
00:09:36,819 --> 00:09:38,159
where no one ever goes,

86
00:09:39,622 --> 00:09:40,672
then you might find him.

87
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:46,399
Unless, he found you first.

88
00:10:05,481 --> 00:10:06,481
Gotcha!

89
00:10:45,354 --> 00:10:46,364
Hey, Elliot!

90
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:26,771
What was that for?

91
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:30,398
Come on, Elliot!

92
00:11:52,254 --> 00:11:53,264
Elliot?

93
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,360
Elliot!

94
00:12:20,616 --> 00:12:21,696
Come on!

95
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:07,411
Higher!

96
00:14:59,108 --> 00:15:00,188
What are you looking at?

97
00:15:38,981 --> 00:15:40,151
This way?

98
00:15:40,316 --> 00:15:41,976
We're pretty far from home.

99
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:35,951
There you are.

100
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:22,579
No one's gonna cut you down now.

101
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:38,961
You ready to go, Grace?

102
00:17:43,564 --> 00:17:44,654
Yeah.

103
00:17:54,116 --> 00:17:55,276
Just a second.

104
00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:57,871
Come on, Grace. Not again.

105
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,330
I'm just settling a score.

106
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:07,249
One for Jack. One for you?

107
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:09,509
Yeah. Something like that.

108
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:12,514
Aren't you two supposed
to be getting hitched?

109
00:18:12,676 --> 00:18:14,886
Yep! Just keeping him on his toes.

110
00:19:04,202 --> 00:19:05,202
Look.

111
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:15,201
Elliot!

112
00:20:00,284 --> 00:20:01,544
Pete and Elliot

113
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:05,037
are

114
00:20:05,061 --> 00:20:06,061
going

115
00:20:06,449 --> 00:20:07,449
and

116
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:09,073
then

117
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:14,272
Then they go down, and down,

118
00:20:14,496 --> 00:20:15,596
and down!

119
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,180
And then...

120
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:38,159
I wonder where that lady came from.

121
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:45,529
Don't worry.

122
00:20:45,996 --> 00:20:47,706
I won't let her hurt you.

123
00:21:10,028 --> 00:21:11,318
Good night, Elliot.

124
00:21:46,714 --> 00:21:47,714
Elliot.

125
00:22:25,804 --> 00:22:27,184
Timber!

126
00:23:07,971 --> 00:23:09,391
Hey, Gavin.

127
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:12,143
Did Jack give the okay to cut this deep?

128
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:15,689
Don't worry about Jack.
Just keep cutting.

129
00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:21,743
Who said it was okay to be here?

130
00:23:21,902 --> 00:23:23,046
I just go where they tell me.

131
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,360
Where's Jack?

132
00:23:24,529 --> 00:23:25,699
There he is!

133
00:23:28,658 --> 00:23:29,948
This is so out of line, Jack.

134
00:23:30,118 --> 00:23:32,305
You're not supposed to be cutting
anywhere near this deep.

135
00:23:32,329 --> 00:23:33,389
I didn't know anything about this either.

136
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:34,503
This wasn't my call, Grace.

137
00:23:34,664 --> 00:23:35,834
Then, whose was it?

138
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:40,052
Of course.

139
00:23:40,212 --> 00:23:41,439
Let me handle this, please?

140
00:23:41,463 --> 00:23:43,303
You don't handle it.
That's the problem.

141
00:23:43,423 --> 00:23:45,474
You're right, and Gavin is Gavin.

142
00:23:45,475 --> 00:23:46,635
He's my brother.

143
00:23:47,344 --> 00:23:49,184
Hey, I have to get to school.

144
00:23:50,055 --> 00:23:51,199
Could you wait in the truck, sweetheart?

145
00:23:51,223 --> 00:23:52,223
We'll just be a minute.

146
00:23:53,892 --> 00:23:54,994
Let's go through the maps.

147
00:23:55,018 --> 00:23:56,058
Let's review them.

148
00:24:29,761 --> 00:24:30,761
Hello?

149
00:24:45,026 --> 00:24:46,066
Wait!

150
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,210
Where are you?

151
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,880
How'd you get up there?

152
00:25:21,646 --> 00:25:22,646
Come on!

153
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,270
Slow down.

154
00:25:24,649 --> 00:25:26,429
You're pretty good at this.

155
00:25:44,377 --> 00:25:45,417
Help!

156
00:25:56,264 --> 00:25:57,644
Don't let go!

157
00:25:59,643 --> 00:26:00,693
No!

158
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:09,610
Don't!

159
00:26:10,862 --> 00:26:12,032
I'm hurt!

160
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:28,550
How old are you?

161
00:26:30,131 --> 00:26:31,131
Five?

162
00:26:31,841 --> 00:26:34,341
You're pretty big to be a five-year-old.

163
00:26:38,306 --> 00:26:39,636
What's your name?

164
00:26:40,225 --> 00:26:41,225
Pete.

165
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:42,810
Pete.

166
00:26:44,896 --> 00:26:46,686
You look like a Pete.

167
00:26:46,856 --> 00:26:48,296
My name's Natalie.
Natalie!

168
00:26:49,693 --> 00:26:51,293
Daddy!
Natalie!

169
00:26:51,653 --> 00:26:52,653
Daddy!

170
00:26:52,821 --> 00:26:54,548
What were you thinking?
You can't run away like that.

171
00:26:54,572 --> 00:26:55,662
What happened to you?

172
00:26:56,032 --> 00:26:57,242
I fell out of a tree.

173
00:26:57,409 --> 00:26:58,739
You fell out of a tree?

174
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:00,110
What were you doing in a tree?

175
00:27:00,954 --> 00:27:02,124
Following him.

176
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:11,046
His name is Pete.

177
00:27:13,216 --> 00:27:14,626
Hey.

178
00:27:15,093 --> 00:27:18,313
Pete? Is that your name?

179
00:27:19,347 --> 00:27:20,517
Pete?

180
00:27:20,682 --> 00:27:21,812
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

181
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:27,959
Where'd you come from?

182
00:27:31,192 --> 00:27:33,112
Do you know where your parents are?

183
00:27:33,878 --> 00:27:34,998
Your family?

184
00:27:41,369 --> 00:27:42,369
Hey.

185
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,620
Where'd you get that?

186
00:27:48,042 --> 00:27:48,742
Wait!

187
00:27:48,768 --> 00:27:49,948
Elliot!
Pete!

188
00:27:53,013 --> 00:27:54,713
Tthere, little buddy.
Where are you going so...

189
00:27:55,114 --> 00:27:55,814
Hey!

190
00:27:57,001 --> 00:27:58,601
Hey, kid! Come back here.

191
00:28:01,848 --> 00:28:03,048
Hey. Come on, boy!

192
00:28:03,641 --> 00:28:04,771
Careful, Gavin!

193
00:28:48,728 --> 00:28:49,728
Doesn't matter.

194
00:28:49,896 --> 00:28:51,655
The sheriff, the rangers, everybody else

195
00:28:51,656 --> 00:28:52,964
are gonna be locking this site down

196
00:28:52,965 --> 00:28:54,575
until they figure out
where that kid came from.

197
00:28:55,151 --> 00:28:56,401
Hey, you hear that?

198
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:58,239
Don't change the subject, Gavin.

199
00:29:12,043 --> 00:29:15,085
Every time I try and take some initiative
you shut me down.

200
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,070
If we hadn't been cutting out here

201
00:29:19,134 --> 00:29:21,344
we never would've found
that kid in the first place.

202
00:29:21,511 --> 00:29:23,261
We're doing good work here, Jack.

203
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,121
And we need a big score
to help us compete.

204
00:29:25,122 --> 00:29:26,266
What about a few years from now

205
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:28,587
when we have nothing left to cut down
because you keep jumping the gun?

206
00:29:29,394 --> 00:29:30,414
Where are you going?

207
00:29:30,438 --> 00:29:31,587
Where do you think?

208
00:29:32,488 --> 00:29:34,518
You're not the only family
I gotta worry about.

209
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:40,318
Let me know how Pete's doing, will ya?

210
00:29:49,247 --> 00:29:50,295
What's wrong, Gavin?

211
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,841
Jack giving you a hard time?

212
00:29:52,459 --> 00:29:53,919
Oh, you know Jack.

213
00:29:54,185 --> 00:29:56,745
He's just sore because
his girlfriend's stepping on his toes.

214
00:29:57,213 --> 00:29:58,633
Redheads, man.

215
00:30:02,844 --> 00:30:04,304
Look out!
Look out!

216
00:30:14,981 --> 00:30:16,151
What was that?

217
00:30:21,654 --> 00:30:22,864
Let's go hunting.

218
00:30:28,203 --> 00:30:29,203
<i>Pete.</i>

219
00:30:33,374 --> 00:30:35,424
<i>Time to wake up, Pete.</i>

220
00:30:38,296 --> 00:30:39,456
Momma?

221
00:30:52,593 --> 00:30:53,593
Elliot?

222
00:31:23,424 --> 00:31:24,704
How's he doing?

223
00:31:24,801 --> 00:31:27,431
Pretty well, all things considered.

224
00:31:27,695 --> 00:31:30,475
No signs of malnourishment
or serious exposure.

225
00:31:30,748 --> 00:31:32,348
He might have a bump to the head, but

226
00:31:32,475 --> 00:31:34,365
Lucky kid.
Yes sure. Super lucky.

227
00:31:34,435 --> 00:31:36,065
How just...
How'd he get out there?

228
00:31:36,137 --> 00:31:38,477
My guess, he was
on a picnic or a camping trip.

229
00:31:38,547 --> 00:31:40,849
He wandered off from his
family, got himself lost.

230
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:42,090
Sure, but...

231
00:31:42,552 --> 00:31:44,642
When? It looks like he's been out there for...

232
00:31:44,821 --> 00:31:46,561
Who knows how long.

233
00:31:47,323 --> 00:31:48,683
And he had this.

234
00:31:49,141 --> 00:31:50,311
You sure that's yours?

235
00:31:52,996 --> 00:31:54,076
Pretty sure.

236
00:31:54,247 --> 00:31:55,787
Here we are. All fixed up.

237
00:31:55,957 --> 00:31:57,467
Hey Natalie.

238
00:31:57,491 --> 00:31:58,533
How you feeling?

239
00:31:58,534 --> 00:32:00,744
It was just a scrape. Where's Pete?

240
00:32:02,463 --> 00:32:04,453
I'm gonna take Natalie home Danny,

241
00:32:04,732 --> 00:32:06,642
then head back out to the forest.

242
00:32:06,809 --> 00:32:10,046
Maybe there's something
out there some...

243
00:32:11,071 --> 00:32:12,261
clue or something.

244
00:32:12,307 --> 00:32:14,047
Could you call me when he wakes up?

245
00:32:14,217 --> 00:32:15,437
Of course.

246
00:32:15,602 --> 00:32:16,892
When he wakes up,

247
00:32:17,278 --> 00:32:19,278
I think it would be best
to take things slowly.

248
00:32:19,447 --> 00:32:21,707
One step at a time.
Let him know he's safe.

249
00:32:22,442 --> 00:32:24,112
We don't know what he's been through.

250
00:32:24,277 --> 00:32:26,697
We put in a call in to Social Services.

251
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:28,869
They'll know exactly how to handle this.

252
00:32:29,032 --> 00:32:30,420
For the time being,

253
00:32:30,745 --> 00:32:32,576
he'll be just fine right here.

254
00:32:33,828 --> 00:32:35,998
Actually, he's gone.

255
00:32:36,364 --> 00:32:37,714
Who's gone, sweetheart?

256
00:32:37,938 --> 00:32:38,938
Pete.

257
00:32:47,383 --> 00:32:48,383
Elliot!

258
00:33:22,377 --> 00:33:23,937
Oh, my goodness!
Macy, stop!

259
00:33:26,381 --> 00:33:27,551
Don't you bark at our dog!

260
00:33:41,604 --> 00:33:42,734
Kid, stop!

261
00:33:42,814 --> 00:33:43,904
Wait, wait!

262
00:33:44,065 --> 00:33:46,225
Damn it! Stop right there.

263
00:33:47,694 --> 00:33:49,534
I've got him.
He's on the corner of Main and

264
00:33:51,406 --> 00:33:52,446
He was on the corner of...

265
00:33:53,908 --> 00:33:55,368
I've lost him.

266
00:34:01,207 --> 00:34:02,787
Hey, look.

267
00:34:45,126 --> 00:34:46,336
Hey, sit down!

268
00:34:53,176 --> 00:34:54,176
Awesome!

269
00:35:03,102 --> 00:35:04,102
Pete!

270
00:35:05,688 --> 00:35:06,808
It's okay.

271
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,778
It's okay.

272
00:35:09,525 --> 00:35:10,645
We're not gonna hurt you.

273
00:35:10,818 --> 00:35:12,948
I promise. All right?

274
00:35:13,112 --> 00:35:14,202
Come here.

275
00:35:17,158 --> 00:35:18,368
Hold on. Hold on.

276
00:35:18,785 --> 00:35:20,655
It's okay. Hold on. Hold on.

277
00:35:20,828 --> 00:35:23,158
Breathe. Breathe.

278
00:35:23,382 --> 00:35:24,682
Breathe.

279
00:35:59,492 --> 00:36:00,502
Hey, guys!

280
00:36:00,826 --> 00:36:02,039
Come check this out.
Hey.

281
00:36:13,881 --> 00:36:14,921
Fresh.

282
00:36:15,091 --> 00:36:16,341
Not even a day old.

283
00:36:17,218 --> 00:36:18,548
What do you think?

284
00:36:19,095 --> 00:36:20,175
A bear?

285
00:36:22,765 --> 00:36:24,725
You ever seen a bear that big?

286
00:36:24,892 --> 00:36:26,152
Thought I did once.

287
00:36:26,835 --> 00:36:28,555
Turns out it was just Bobby's sister.

288
00:36:50,585 --> 00:36:53,415
All right, let's catch me some rabbits.

289
00:37:00,303 --> 00:37:01,697
I'll bring him home tonight.

290
00:37:01,721 --> 00:37:03,601
Okay, thank you so much, Sheriff.

291
00:37:03,764 --> 00:37:05,774
You take care of yourself.
Thank you.

292
00:37:05,933 --> 00:37:07,023
Bye.

293
00:37:07,143 --> 00:37:09,193
Remember, any problems I'm the guy.

294
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:10,350
Will do.

295
00:37:17,945 --> 00:37:19,105
Hey, Pete.

296
00:37:19,822 --> 00:37:20,757
Don't worry,

297
00:37:20,982 --> 00:37:22,986
you don't have to go
back to the hospital.

298
00:37:23,326 --> 00:37:24,786
We're going to my house.

299
00:38:13,876 --> 00:38:14,876
Okay.

300
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,600
Here we are.

301
00:38:21,509 --> 00:38:22,889
Need a little help?

302
00:38:24,178 --> 00:38:25,638
Pete, no! Wait!
Wait!

303
00:38:26,514 --> 00:38:29,024
Wait! Wait, wait.

304
00:38:30,643 --> 00:38:33,193
You are fast.

305
00:38:33,354 --> 00:38:35,194
Oh, my goodness.

306
00:38:35,356 --> 00:38:36,896
What's wrong, honey?

307
00:38:37,066 --> 00:38:38,526
Are you hungry?

308
00:38:38,901 --> 00:38:41,361
Let's go inside.
Let's go get something to eat.

309
00:38:42,154 --> 00:38:43,364
I want to go home.

310
00:38:45,241 --> 00:38:46,241
I know.

311
00:38:46,409 --> 00:38:47,908
Where is your home?

312
00:38:48,433 --> 00:38:49,753
Can you tell me?

313
00:38:55,001 --> 00:38:56,681
How about this?

314
00:38:57,044 --> 00:38:59,214
If you come inside with me now,

315
00:38:59,338 --> 00:39:01,718
then tomorrow,

316
00:39:02,091 --> 00:39:03,551
I'll take you back out to the woods

317
00:39:03,676 --> 00:39:06,756
and you can show me exactly where you live.

318
00:39:07,513 --> 00:39:08,763
How does that sound?

319
00:39:09,557 --> 00:39:13,017
You know, when I was a little girl

320
00:39:14,061 --> 00:39:17,331
I wanted to live in the forest
more than anything.

321
00:39:18,399 --> 00:39:20,109
I loved being out there.

322
00:39:20,276 --> 00:39:21,669
It was so fun with,

323
00:39:21,994 --> 00:39:23,020
the squirrels,

324
00:39:23,478 --> 00:39:24,510
the birds,

325
00:39:24,535 --> 00:39:25,782
the trees.

326
00:39:26,707 --> 00:39:28,317
So, when I grew up,

327
00:39:28,784 --> 00:39:31,454
I made it my job to protect the woods,

328
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:33,550
and everything in them.

329
00:39:34,623 --> 00:39:37,693
Which I suppose includes you.

330
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:42,420
And Elliot?

331
00:39:43,549 --> 00:39:44,759
Who's Elliot?

332
00:39:46,594 --> 00:39:47,894
Grace?

333
00:39:56,771 --> 00:39:57,956
Are you sure about this?

334
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:00,320
It's just until we found out
where he belongs.

335
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:05,138
Who knows maybe being around
someone his own age will help him,

336
00:40:05,363 --> 00:40:06,591
open up.

337
00:40:06,739 --> 00:40:08,669
Maybe he'll tell us where he came from.

338
00:40:09,041 --> 00:40:10,551
You don't touch it. You eat it.

339
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:12,688
Like this.

340
00:40:13,996 --> 00:40:15,076
I gotta admit,

341
00:40:15,247 --> 00:40:18,067
living out in the woods,
doing things his own way,

342
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:21,260
sounds like a boy after your own heart?

343
00:40:29,512 --> 00:40:31,182
I think we're lost.

344
00:40:31,347 --> 00:40:33,427
Gavin knows what he's doing.

345
00:40:34,183 --> 00:40:36,313
You said that three miles ago.

346
00:40:36,811 --> 00:40:38,691
The river's up around that bend.

347
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,480
We can just follow that,

348
00:40:40,523 --> 00:40:41,750
and we'll be back where we started.

349
00:40:41,774 --> 00:40:43,614
The river's back that way.

350
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:45,436
We've been going in circles.

351
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,280
I've never been out this far before.

352
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:20,689
Do you know where we are?

353
00:41:24,733 --> 00:41:26,363
Look at this.

354
00:41:26,902 --> 00:41:28,322
What on Earth?

355
00:41:29,655 --> 00:41:30,985
You've got to see this.

356
00:41:45,087 --> 00:41:46,417
You think that kid did all this?

357
00:41:47,173 --> 00:41:49,093
What would a kid be doing this far out?

358
00:41:50,718 --> 00:41:52,158
Hey, guys! Look at this.

359
00:41:56,056 --> 00:41:57,216
Run!

360
00:42:05,691 --> 00:42:06,781
Hurry up!

361
00:42:06,859 --> 00:42:08,739
Come on! Faster! Run!

362
00:42:14,283 --> 00:42:15,583
Wait for me!

363
00:42:18,412 --> 00:42:19,912
Come on. Get up, get up!

364
00:42:20,915 --> 00:42:22,625
Start the truck!

365
00:42:22,791 --> 00:42:23,881
Where's Gavin?

366
00:42:24,043 --> 00:42:25,133
Come on, man!

367
00:42:27,254 --> 00:42:28,264
Wait!

368
00:42:30,966 --> 00:42:32,266
Come on, let's go!

369
00:42:32,968 --> 00:42:34,258
Go, go, go!

370
00:42:35,554 --> 00:42:36,764
What is that?

371
00:42:40,726 --> 00:42:42,436
Drive, man! Go!

372
00:43:32,152 --> 00:43:33,612
Gavin, come on!

373
00:43:42,329 --> 00:43:43,409
What was that?

374
00:43:43,497 --> 00:43:44,497
What was that?

375
00:43:47,293 --> 00:43:48,643
Did you see that?

376
00:43:48,802 --> 00:43:49,802
Did you see that?

377
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:51,373
It was a monster!
No, man, that was a demon.

378
00:43:51,397 --> 00:43:52,437
It was a monster demon.

379
00:43:52,606 --> 00:43:53,976
It was a dragon!

380
00:44:03,976 --> 00:44:05,886
You put the needle on, and

381
00:44:22,494 --> 00:44:23,544
Let it play.

382
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:28,900
So that's me,

383
00:44:29,024 --> 00:44:30,510
and that's my dad.

384
00:44:30,811 --> 00:44:31,981
That's his brother.

385
00:44:32,304 --> 00:44:34,624
There's Grace. That's my family.

386
00:44:35,382 --> 00:44:36,482
Family.

387
00:44:38,552 --> 00:44:40,012
That's what we are.

388
00:44:47,561 --> 00:44:49,386
Put your head here,

389
00:44:49,811 --> 00:44:51,015
scooch down,

390
00:44:51,357 --> 00:44:52,117
and...

391
00:44:53,242 --> 00:44:54,721
now you're five years old.

392
00:44:59,114 --> 00:45:00,744
Now you're six, and now you're seven,

393
00:45:00,866 --> 00:45:02,306
now you're eight, now you're nine

394
00:45:02,451 --> 00:45:03,451
and now you're 10.

395
00:45:22,554 --> 00:45:25,164
I was out here, at the Eastern Pad.

396
00:45:25,224 --> 00:45:27,904
That's the last time
I remember having my compass.

397
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:30,100
But that's...
Fifty miles east.

398
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:31,610
From where we found him.

399
00:45:51,125 --> 00:45:52,785
I haven't read that book in forever.

400
00:45:53,327 --> 00:45:55,577
Someone gave it to me when
I was learning how to read, so...

401
00:45:59,241 --> 00:46:00,241
It's okay, buddy.

402
00:46:00,759 --> 00:46:01,759
It's just a phone.

403
00:46:15,315 --> 00:46:17,645
Is this Elliot, Pete?

404
00:46:20,529 --> 00:46:23,399
Is Elliot a person?

405
00:46:24,324 --> 00:46:25,374
No.

406
00:46:26,326 --> 00:46:27,686
Well, what is he, then?

407
00:46:27,861 --> 00:46:28,622
Grace,

408
00:46:29,147 --> 00:46:30,204
it's the Sheriff.

409
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:31,825
He wants to talk to you.

410
00:46:35,310 --> 00:46:36,310
Hello?

411
00:46:36,462 --> 00:46:38,512
Hey, Grace. How's our mystery boy?

412
00:46:38,672 --> 00:46:40,132
Still a mystery.

413
00:46:40,716 --> 00:46:42,046
Any news?

414
00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:43,278
<i>Well,</i>

415
00:46:43,303 --> 00:46:45,605
Pat went digging through
our missing persons files.

416
00:46:47,222 --> 00:46:49,412
He had to go pretty far back but...

417
00:46:50,976 --> 00:46:52,726
it's not good news.

418
00:46:54,146 --> 00:46:55,146
Poor Pete.

419
00:46:55,314 --> 00:46:56,364
<i>I know.</i>

420
00:46:57,191 --> 00:46:59,691
<i>I just got off the phone
with Social Services.</i>

421
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:01,990
<i>They're gonna take custody
of him tomorrow morning.</i>

422
00:47:02,821 --> 00:47:03,821
Pete,

423
00:47:03,989 --> 00:47:06,029
is Elliot your imaginary friend?

424
00:47:06,867 --> 00:47:08,237
What's imaginary?

425
00:47:08,877 --> 00:47:11,237
Well, it's where you make
someone up in your head,

426
00:47:11,438 --> 00:47:13,648
so that you have someone to talk to.

427
00:47:14,333 --> 00:47:16,173
It keeps you from being lonely.

428
00:47:18,545 --> 00:47:19,875
Are they funny?

429
00:47:20,589 --> 00:47:21,669
Sure.

430
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:24,260
Do they fly?

431
00:47:25,052 --> 00:47:27,762
I guess they can do
whatever you want them to.

432
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:29,680
That's what makes them imaginary.

433
00:47:31,016 --> 00:47:33,266
Are you my imaginary friend, too?

434
00:47:35,729 --> 00:47:37,059
I'm real.

435
00:47:39,525 --> 00:47:40,895
So is Elliot.

436
00:47:47,574 --> 00:47:48,704
Good job, buddy.

437
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:00,860
Mommy, there's a monster outside.

438
00:48:26,113 --> 00:48:27,613
I need to get back to him.

439
00:48:28,699 --> 00:48:30,949
He gets scared when I'm gone.

440
00:48:31,368 --> 00:48:32,818
He looks like a dragon.

441
00:48:34,496 --> 00:48:35,886
What's a dragon?

442
00:48:36,456 --> 00:48:38,166
That's a dragon.

443
00:48:38,333 --> 00:48:39,463
Like the song.

444
00:48:39,543 --> 00:48:40,673
What song?

445
00:48:40,794 --> 00:48:43,134
There's a song that my dad used to sing.

446
00:48:43,297 --> 00:48:45,297
It's about dragons and where they live.

447
00:48:48,385 --> 00:48:51,985
♪ <i>Go North, Go North ♪
♪ With wings on your feet</i> ♪

448
00:48:52,055 --> 00:48:56,015

454
00:49:16,930 --> 00:49:18,070
What's North?

455
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:19,730
It's a direction.

456
00:49:19,799 --> 00:49:21,049
How do you get there?

457
00:49:21,835 --> 00:49:23,146
Well. You could look at a map.

458
00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:24,770
Or you could follow the North Star.

459
00:49:24,838 --> 00:49:27,468
If you follow it as far as you possibly can

460
00:49:27,541 --> 00:49:29,251
you get to the mountains.

461
00:49:29,517 --> 00:49:30,847
And that's where you'd find them.

462
00:49:30,977 --> 00:49:32,517
The dragons, I mean.

463
00:49:34,181 --> 00:49:35,181
Hey.

464
00:49:36,099 --> 00:49:38,069
I haven't heard that song in forever.

465
00:49:39,686 --> 00:49:40,806
Natalie,

466
00:49:41,897 --> 00:49:43,907
do you think I could talk
to Pete alone for a moment?

467
00:49:45,025 --> 00:49:46,025
Okay.

468
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:48,400
See you in a minute, Pete.

469
00:49:55,911 --> 00:49:57,081
Hey, come here.

470
00:50:03,877 --> 00:50:05,432
You found this for me,

471
00:50:06,257 --> 00:50:07,431
didn't you?

472
00:50:09,883 --> 00:50:11,723
Where the trees ran away.

473
00:50:14,221 --> 00:50:18,561
My dad gave this to me on my 10th birthday

474
00:50:19,109 --> 00:50:20,429
so that if I ever got lost,

475
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:22,750
I'd know how to find my way back home.

476
00:50:24,398 --> 00:50:25,398
Pete honey,

477
00:50:26,942 --> 00:50:29,042
do you remember how
you got to the woods?

478
00:50:32,572 --> 00:50:34,512
It was a long time ago, wasn't it?

479
00:50:37,994 --> 00:50:39,964
We were on an adventure.

480
00:50:46,461 --> 00:50:47,461
You know,

481
00:50:47,921 --> 00:50:51,471
I lost my mom when
I was not much older than you.

482
00:50:54,428 --> 00:50:56,428
I know how hard it can be.

483
00:50:57,931 --> 00:50:59,642
But I want you to know,

484
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:01,715
you are not alone.

485
00:51:02,686 --> 00:51:03,686
I know.

486
00:51:04,312 --> 00:51:05,312
You do?

487
00:51:06,606 --> 00:51:07,766
I have Elliot.

488
00:51:10,777 --> 00:51:12,647
Can you tell me more about Elliot?

489
00:51:12,863 --> 00:51:14,283
Who is he?

490
00:51:25,625 --> 00:51:27,285
He's my friend.

491
00:51:30,505 --> 00:51:31,875
This is Elliot?

492
00:51:33,675 --> 00:51:36,545
He must be a very special friend.

493
00:51:36,803 --> 00:51:39,328
He doesn't like most people.

494
00:51:40,353 --> 00:51:42,277
But I think he'd like you.

495
00:51:43,393 --> 00:51:44,393
He would?

496
00:51:47,814 --> 00:51:49,302
You'll see.

497
00:51:49,827 --> 00:51:51,078
Tomorrow.

498
00:51:51,818 --> 00:51:53,068
Tomorrow.

499
00:51:53,904 --> 00:51:55,504
When I go home.

500
00:51:55,864 --> 00:51:57,614
You're coming with me, right?

501
00:51:58,158 --> 00:51:59,158
Of course.

502
00:52:02,245 --> 00:52:03,945
You're very brave.

503
00:52:05,165 --> 00:52:06,665
Did you know that?

504
00:52:07,584 --> 00:52:11,094
You might be the bravest boy
I've ever met.

505
00:53:15,944 --> 00:53:17,803
Gavin?
Jack.

506
00:53:17,804 --> 00:53:18,671
What happened to you?

507
00:53:18,672 --> 00:53:20,972
You remember those stories
that Meacham used to tell us?

508
00:53:22,158 --> 00:53:23,438
About dragons?

509
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:26,330
He wasn't making them up.

510
00:53:26,621 --> 00:53:28,751
We tracked it,
and there was a treehouse.

511
00:53:29,132 --> 00:53:30,082
I tried to shoot it,

512
00:53:30,083 --> 00:53:32,217
but it just ripped the gun
right out of my hands

513
00:53:32,218 --> 00:53:33,498
and bent it like it was nothing.

514
00:53:33,653 --> 00:53:34,936
Gavin, I can't just head out

515
00:53:34,937 --> 00:53:36,941
to the woods in the middle of the night
because you think you saw a dragon.

516
00:53:36,965 --> 00:53:38,855
Think I saw? Jack, I know what I saw.

517
00:53:39,867 --> 00:53:40,787
Yeah.

518
00:53:42,678 --> 00:53:43,878
You don't believe me.

519
00:53:43,972 --> 00:53:45,357
I'll tell you what we'll do.

520
00:53:45,381 --> 00:53:46,304
We'll call the forestry,

521
00:53:46,329 --> 00:53:48,694
we tell them what you saw
and then they can go and deal with it.

522
00:53:48,818 --> 00:53:50,378
Fine. I get the picture.

523
00:53:52,105 --> 00:53:53,965
I thought I could count on family.

524
00:53:55,575 --> 00:53:56,375
Gavin.

525
00:53:56,443 --> 00:53:57,993
Don't worry. See you in the morning.

526
00:54:43,323 --> 00:54:45,663
Elliot Gets Lost.

527
00:54:49,329 --> 00:54:51,689
This is the story of a little puppy.

528
00:54:52,073 --> 00:54:53,999
His name is...
Elliot.

529
00:54:54,167 --> 00:54:55,587
Yeah.

530
00:54:55,669 --> 00:54:58,549
He is going on an adventure
with his family.

531
00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:03,260
They are going camping in the forest.

532
00:55:03,426 --> 00:55:04,426
Elliot has

533
00:55:04,511 --> 00:55:05,511
Wait.

534
00:55:07,055 --> 00:55:08,915
This isn't how I tell it.

535
00:55:15,271 --> 00:55:17,091
Would you like me to stop?

536
00:55:17,773 --> 00:55:18,773
No.

537
00:55:19,192 --> 00:55:20,382
I like it.

538
00:55:29,369 --> 00:55:32,949
Elliot has never been so excited.

539
00:55:33,289 --> 00:55:35,579
Elliot and his boy play,

540
00:55:35,709 --> 00:55:37,879
while Mom and Dad set up the tent.

541
00:55:37,961 --> 00:55:40,551
He is right where he belongs.

542
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:13,079
You looking for something?

543
00:57:14,057 --> 00:57:15,977
Oh. You scared me.

544
00:57:16,851 --> 00:57:18,481
Why aren't you asleep?

545
00:57:18,645 --> 00:57:20,475
The same reason you're not, I suppose.

546
00:57:20,647 --> 00:57:22,889
I guess you heard about the boy.

547
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:24,220
I did.

548
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:26,660
You know, word travels fast in this town.

549
00:57:26,786 --> 00:57:28,126
How long has he been out there?

550
00:57:28,488 --> 00:57:29,628
Six years.

551
00:57:30,323 --> 00:57:31,423
Six years?

552
00:57:31,866 --> 00:57:35,076
Nobody can survive
in that forest for six years.

553
00:57:35,661 --> 00:57:36,701
At least not alone.

554
00:57:36,871 --> 00:57:37,804
Well.

555
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:38,895
He says...

556
00:57:41,334 --> 00:57:43,454
He says he wasn't alone.

557
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:48,040
He drew this?

558
00:57:49,342 --> 00:57:52,182
He says it's his friend from the forest.

559
00:57:52,712 --> 00:57:53,932
And it reminded me of...

560
00:57:54,013 --> 00:57:55,853
I know what it reminded you of.

561
00:57:57,183 --> 00:57:58,233
That one?

562
00:58:00,019 --> 00:58:02,519
How old was I when you drew this for me?

563
00:58:02,689 --> 00:58:04,564
Maybe five or six.

564
00:58:04,565 --> 00:58:06,025
Just before your mother passed away.

565
00:58:06,568 --> 00:58:09,778
I remember then,
you hung on every word I ever said.

566
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:13,030
You were so full of questions.

567
00:58:13,716 --> 00:58:14,716
Dad.

568
00:58:17,704 --> 00:58:19,754
What did you really see out there?

569
00:58:20,014 --> 00:58:22,707
Please, don't tell me another story.

570
00:58:22,708 --> 00:58:24,608
Just tell me what you remember.

571
00:58:28,590 --> 00:58:30,120
What I remember?

572
00:58:31,801 --> 00:58:34,721
What I remember is, I was out hunting...

573
00:58:36,055 --> 00:58:37,795
and the sun was shining down,

574
00:58:38,224 --> 00:58:39,702
and wind was blowing through the trees.

575
00:58:39,726 --> 00:58:42,536
And I remember thinking,
Boy, this is exactly where I belong.

576
00:58:43,605 --> 00:58:45,605
I stopped by a creek to get a drink.

577
00:58:45,773 --> 00:58:48,174
Suddenly I realize
I wasn't in the sun anymore

578
00:58:48,175 --> 00:58:50,235
and I looked up to see
what was blocking the sky.

579
00:58:50,411 --> 00:58:51,825
And what did I see but...

580
00:58:53,150 --> 00:58:54,235
a dragon?

581
00:58:54,991 --> 00:58:56,581
I see a dragon.

582
00:58:58,494 --> 00:59:00,284
I've never been so scared in my life.

583
00:59:01,581 --> 00:59:04,291
But when I raised my gun to shoot,

584
00:59:04,659 --> 00:59:08,089
suddenly there was this feeling, this...

585
00:59:09,172 --> 00:59:10,672
It was like magic.

586
00:59:11,591 --> 00:59:14,461
There's no other word to express it.
It was magic.

587
00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:17,461
So I put my gun down,

588
00:59:18,486 --> 00:59:19,834
and just sat there...

589
00:59:20,673 --> 00:59:22,483
sat there across the creek from each other,

590
00:59:22,507 --> 00:59:23,653
just, just looking.

591
00:59:24,312 --> 00:59:26,112
I just sat there looking.

592
00:59:26,272 --> 00:59:29,616
And then the dragon turned and
disappeared into the woods.

593
00:59:29,617 --> 00:59:31,987
And I remember thinking,
I am one lucky guy.

594
00:59:35,323 --> 00:59:36,823
Of course, nobody believed me.

595
00:59:37,533 --> 00:59:39,568
I knew what people
were saying about me.

596
00:59:39,569 --> 00:59:42,162
I must admit, there were times when
I thought, Maybe they're right.

597
00:59:42,163 --> 00:59:44,833
But then I thought about the magic.

598
00:59:45,667 --> 00:59:48,276
It changed the way I see the world

599
00:59:48,277 --> 00:59:50,237
the way I see trees,
the way I see sunshine

600
00:59:50,504 --> 00:59:52,054
the way even I see you.

601
00:59:54,008 --> 00:59:56,148
I wouldn't trade that for anything.

602
00:59:59,806 --> 01:00:02,556
So, I'm not gonna try to
convince you. I quit that.

603
01:00:02,892 --> 01:00:04,070
But maybe...

604
01:00:05,095 --> 01:00:06,694
maybe can you just be open to...

605
01:00:08,219 --> 01:00:09,251
looking.

606
01:00:11,317 --> 01:00:12,987
I know those woods.

607
01:00:15,321 --> 01:00:17,821
I know those woods
like the back of my hand.

608
01:00:20,326 --> 01:00:22,156
I couldn't have missed a dragon.

609
01:00:24,872 --> 01:00:26,502
Well, you missed Pete.

610
01:00:44,392 --> 01:00:45,522
Pete.

611
01:00:46,019 --> 01:00:47,349
Wake up, honey.

612
01:00:51,941 --> 01:00:53,031
Good morning.

613
01:00:53,526 --> 01:00:54,856
Good morning.

614
01:01:01,784 --> 01:01:03,444
You heading out already?
Yup.

615
01:01:03,453 --> 01:01:04,583
Bright and early.

616
01:01:07,415 --> 01:01:08,995
I'm gonna head over to the mill.

617
01:01:09,483 --> 01:01:11,113
Talk to Gavin about something.

618
01:01:11,377 --> 01:01:12,537
Call me if you need anything.

619
01:01:12,745 --> 01:01:13,745
We'll be fine.

620
01:01:14,047 --> 01:01:15,047
You sure?

621
01:01:15,590 --> 01:01:17,100
Absolutely.

622
01:01:49,457 --> 01:01:50,457
What's wrong?

623
01:01:54,921 --> 01:01:55,921
Nothing.

624
01:01:56,089 --> 01:01:57,724
Nothing, I just got...

625
01:01:58,049 --> 01:01:59,163
turned around.

626
01:02:03,471 --> 01:02:04,601
Hey, Pete

627
01:02:04,764 --> 01:02:07,984
I was thinking maybe
we could bring someone with us.

628
01:02:08,142 --> 01:02:10,812
Someone who might know Elliot, too.

629
01:02:10,978 --> 01:02:12,268
Is that okay?

630
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:39,670
Hey, Jack.
Morning.

631
01:02:40,633 --> 01:02:41,683
Hey, Jack.

632
01:02:41,801 --> 01:02:42,814
Hey, Calvin.

633
01:02:43,039 --> 01:02:44,255
You seen Gavin?

634
01:02:44,611 --> 01:02:46,871
He and Woodrow took a truck
out to the new cut down

635
01:02:46,872 --> 01:02:47,992
with some of the other boys.

636
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:49,070
What for?

637
01:02:49,150 --> 01:02:50,480
Something about going hunting.

638
01:02:50,643 --> 01:02:52,153
Hunting?
I don't know.

639
01:02:53,187 --> 01:02:54,187
Hunting?

640
01:02:59,652 --> 01:03:01,296
Jack Magary.
<i>Hey, Jack.</i>

641
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:03,570
<i>Didn't you say Grace was
planning on bringing Pete by?</i>

642
01:03:03,939 --> 01:03:05,019
Yeah, she left an hour ago.

643
01:03:05,391 --> 01:03:07,111
<i>She hasn't shown up yet.</i>

644
01:03:07,193 --> 01:03:08,863
<i>We've got these people standing here.</i>

645
01:03:09,228 --> 01:03:10,558
<i>Don't quite know what to do.</i>

646
01:03:10,929 --> 01:03:13,009
Okay. Okay, thank you, Sheriff.
I gotta go.

647
01:03:23,050 --> 01:03:24,220
This way!

648
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:28,720
Kids, hold on a second.

649
01:03:37,106 --> 01:03:38,396
Elliot!

650
01:03:46,699 --> 01:03:49,319
I've never seen this part
of the forest before.

651
01:03:59,212 --> 01:04:00,212
Come on!

652
01:04:23,110 --> 01:04:24,400
Cool.

653
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:33,080
How did you do this by yourself?

654
01:04:33,246 --> 01:04:35,986
Elliot helped. I think he's hiding.

655
01:04:50,221 --> 01:04:51,681
Elliot?

656
01:05:09,031 --> 01:05:10,031
Oh, no, Pete, wait

657
01:05:11,617 --> 01:05:13,907
I'm going in after him.
Grace, wait.

658
01:05:14,745 --> 01:05:16,365
Give it a minute.

659
01:05:25,923 --> 01:05:27,053
Grace?

660
01:05:47,945 --> 01:05:48,945
Dad.

661
01:05:52,158 --> 01:05:53,238
Dad.

662
01:05:55,176 --> 01:05:56,256
Come on.

663
01:06:16,932 --> 01:06:19,772
What did I tell you?
Magic.

664
01:06:38,454 --> 01:06:39,464
Elliot.

665
01:06:58,015 --> 01:06:59,255
What did I tell you?

666
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:13,640
I got him!

667
01:07:14,656 --> 01:07:15,656
Gavin?

668
01:07:15,780 --> 01:07:16,780
Grace?

669
01:07:21,247 --> 01:07:22,787
No! No, wait!
Stop!

670
01:07:22,957 --> 01:07:24,707
Get those kids outta here!

671
01:07:28,963 --> 01:07:31,173
Don't kill him! Tranqs only!

672
01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:32,484
Gavin, what are you doing?

673
01:07:32,508 --> 01:07:33,588
He's not dangerous!

674
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:35,379
He's not gonna hurt.
Will you stop!

675
01:07:35,886 --> 01:07:37,176
I got him!
No!

676
01:07:39,849 --> 01:07:41,059
No!
Stop!

677
01:07:44,729 --> 01:07:45,809
Elliot!

678
01:07:54,196 --> 01:07:55,526
Here we go! Come on, get up!

679
01:07:55,698 --> 01:07:56,868
No!

680
01:08:03,914 --> 01:08:05,084
Bobby, take the shot!

681
01:08:11,922 --> 01:08:14,222
Stop! Elliot!

682
01:08:14,383 --> 01:08:15,593
Fly!

683
01:08:21,849 --> 01:08:23,269
Come on!

684
01:08:28,397 --> 01:08:30,147
Come on! Go! Go!

685
01:08:31,817 --> 01:08:32,817
Elliot.

686
01:08:44,330 --> 01:08:45,330
Watch out!

687
01:09:42,930 --> 01:09:43,970
What is that?

688
01:09:44,974 --> 01:09:46,354
Daddy?

689
01:09:47,601 --> 01:09:48,691
Natalie?

690
01:09:50,329 --> 01:09:51,669
Gavin, what is this?

691
01:09:53,816 --> 01:09:54,739
This...

692
01:09:55,764 --> 01:09:57,331
is the Millhaven dragon.

693
01:09:59,154 --> 01:10:00,994
And I just caught it.

694
01:10:59,548 --> 01:11:01,218
What's the matter, boys?

695
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:04,010
Ain't you ever seen a dragon before?

696
01:11:04,845 --> 01:11:05,845
Come on.

697
01:11:05,930 --> 01:11:09,180
Pull it into the warehouse.
Into the warehouse.

698
01:11:15,272 --> 01:11:17,482
Check it out, boys. Check it out!

699
01:11:23,030 --> 01:11:25,670
Pete, Grace didn't
mean for this to happen.

700
01:11:34,750 --> 01:11:36,670
She's a beauty, isn't she?

701
01:11:37,419 --> 01:11:38,906
Or he?

702
01:11:39,131 --> 01:11:40,097
It?

703
01:11:40,898 --> 01:11:41,981
Whatever it is.

704
01:11:41,982 --> 01:11:44,192
Just trust me.
Get here as quick as you can.

705
01:11:46,345 --> 01:11:47,425
Natalie.

706
01:11:48,097 --> 01:11:51,307
I need you to wait here
with Pete for a minute, okay?

707
01:11:51,575 --> 01:11:52,895
What's going to happen to Elliot?

708
01:11:53,193 --> 01:11:54,193
I don't know,

709
01:11:54,278 --> 01:11:55,788
but I'm going to go find out, okay?

710
01:11:55,854 --> 01:11:57,644
I just need you to stay here.

711
01:11:57,806 --> 01:11:59,306
Okay? Will you stay here for me?

712
01:11:59,775 --> 01:12:00,775
Okay.

713
01:12:01,099 --> 01:12:02,199
Thank you, sweetie.

714
01:12:07,324 --> 01:12:09,564
Pete, we'll fix this.

715
01:12:10,327 --> 01:12:11,497
I promise.

716
01:12:19,670 --> 01:12:21,760
Okay, then.
Now you've caught it.

717
01:12:22,339 --> 01:12:23,579
What do you plan to do with it?

718
01:12:24,116 --> 01:12:25,476
What am I going to do with it?
Yeah.

719
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:28,810
Well I know exactly
what I'm going to do with it.

720
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:31,670
You, you don't have a clue, do you?

721
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:34,052
Okay, look.
I haven't got it totally figured out yet.

722
01:12:34,176 --> 01:12:35,196
But I'll tell you this...

723
01:12:35,244 --> 01:12:37,474
This thing is gonna put me on the map.

724
01:12:37,738 --> 01:12:39,040
I mean folks will come from miles...

725
01:12:39,064 --> 01:12:41,174
Gavin.
Jack can have the mill.

726
01:12:41,241 --> 01:12:42,241
The dragon is mine.

727
01:12:44,361 --> 01:12:45,741
No, no, no! Stop. Stop.

728
01:12:53,412 --> 01:12:55,042
What are they doing to him?

729
01:12:55,998 --> 01:12:57,238
They're trying to find out

730
01:12:57,382 --> 01:12:59,482
what he is and where he came from.

731
01:13:00,044 --> 01:13:02,044
And why they've never seen him before.

732
01:13:03,213 --> 01:13:04,473
Hey, what are you doing?

733
01:13:04,631 --> 01:13:05,841
Get those guns out of here.

734
01:13:06,008 --> 01:13:08,588
He came from the woods,
just like I did.

735
01:13:08,612 --> 01:13:09,751
Are you serious?

736
01:13:10,220 --> 01:13:12,100
Why can't they just let us go?

737
01:13:12,564 --> 01:13:13,733
We'll go away.

738
01:13:14,158 --> 01:13:16,328
We'll never see anybody again.

739
01:13:16,602 --> 01:13:18,552
It'll be just like it used to be.

740
01:13:19,521 --> 01:13:21,611
But I don't wanna never see you again.

741
01:13:24,526 --> 01:13:25,896
Are you insane?

742
01:13:26,070 --> 01:13:28,700
You have no idea
what this thing is capable of.

743
01:13:28,864 --> 01:13:30,204
And you do?
Yeah.

744
01:13:30,365 --> 01:13:31,365
If he wakes up,

745
01:13:31,450 --> 01:13:33,136
he could take out the whole town
and everyone in it.

746
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:34,620
Jack, he's a monster.

747
01:13:34,787 --> 01:13:36,237
It's not a monster.

748
01:13:36,961 --> 01:13:38,161
It's an animal.

749
01:13:38,657 --> 01:13:40,107
And it's hurt and it's scared.

750
01:13:40,292 --> 01:13:41,322
Grace, wait.

751
01:13:47,174 --> 01:13:48,344
You need help.

752
01:13:51,011 --> 01:13:52,551
You need Pete.

753
01:14:02,773 --> 01:14:04,653
Did you see that?

754
01:14:04,817 --> 01:14:06,237
Did you just see that?

755
01:14:07,486 --> 01:14:08,986
I sure did.

756
01:14:17,579 --> 01:14:18,619
Let's go.

757
01:14:41,436 --> 01:14:42,476
Up there.

758
01:14:42,646 --> 01:14:44,356
Guys, move. Sheriff!

759
01:14:45,274 --> 01:14:46,794
Sheriff! Sheriff!
Jack.

760
01:14:47,568 --> 01:14:49,308
No, out of the way. Back off.

761
01:14:49,432 --> 01:14:50,361
Sheriff!

762
01:14:50,462 --> 01:14:52,042
Out of the way! Sheriff!

763
01:14:52,990 --> 01:14:54,160
Thanks for coming.

764
01:14:54,283 --> 01:14:55,426
Jack, what's so big

765
01:14:55,450 --> 01:14:56,736
I had to call out the cavalry?

766
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:58,263
You really have to come inside and see this.

767
01:14:58,287 --> 01:15:00,367
Gavin.
Let me just say one thing first here.

768
01:15:00,539 --> 01:15:02,259
What my brother called you about,

769
01:15:02,324 --> 01:15:03,914
belongs to me, okay?

770
01:15:03,976 --> 01:15:05,226
I caught it fair and square.

771
01:15:05,594 --> 01:15:08,604
So, if anyone tries to tell you
any different, it's mine.

772
01:15:09,063 --> 01:15:10,063
It belongs to me.

773
01:15:10,198 --> 01:15:11,308
I wanna see!

774
01:15:11,633 --> 01:15:12,902
Why are we standing outside?

775
01:15:12,926 --> 01:15:14,336
Can we go in and take a look at it?

776
01:15:33,822 --> 01:15:36,782
Elliot, are you okay?

777
01:15:41,872 --> 01:15:43,152
What's going on in there?

778
01:15:44,291 --> 01:15:45,435
Now, I gotta warn you.

779
01:15:45,459 --> 01:15:46,879
This thing is dangerous.

780
01:15:47,044 --> 01:15:49,484
Me and my crew are the only ones
who know how to deal with it.

781
01:15:49,630 --> 01:15:51,732
So, when you get in there, just stay calm.

782
01:15:51,756 --> 01:15:52,916
Don't startle it.

783
01:15:53,091 --> 01:15:54,800
Don't want anyone getting
eaten on my watch.

784
01:15:54,801 --> 01:15:56,510
Gavin, wait.
Listen, Grace,

785
01:15:56,595 --> 01:15:58,281
we're not in the forest anymore,
so what's in there

786
01:15:58,305 --> 01:15:59,407
You can sit out here

787
01:15:59,431 --> 01:16:00,491
and talk about what's in there

788
01:16:00,515 --> 01:16:01,576
until you're blue in the face.

789
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:03,800
I just want to see it. Now step aside.

790
01:16:08,857 --> 01:16:10,417
We're waiting over here. Come on.

791
01:16:10,567 --> 01:16:11,607
Push it open.

792
01:16:11,693 --> 01:16:13,213
What's the deal here?

793
01:16:14,613 --> 01:16:15,653
Excuse me, Sheriff.

794
01:16:17,574 --> 01:16:19,414
Seems to be stuck.

795
01:16:19,576 --> 01:16:21,316
Okay, come on. Who's in there?

796
01:16:22,986 --> 01:16:24,086
Hey, open up.

797
01:16:25,048 --> 01:16:26,048
Elliot.

798
01:16:26,699 --> 01:16:27,889
Can you fly?

799
01:16:28,627 --> 01:16:30,027
Hit it harder!

800
01:16:41,598 --> 01:16:42,918
I don't see anything.

801
01:16:42,991 --> 01:16:44,239
It was right here.

802
01:16:44,239 --> 01:16:45,366
What was right here?

803
01:16:47,521 --> 01:16:48,521
It got out.

804
01:16:49,089 --> 01:16:50,442
Come on, we gotta find it!

805
01:16:50,466 --> 01:16:52,319
Make a hole!
What got out?

806
01:16:52,401 --> 01:16:53,841
You gotta see for yourself.
Come on.

807
01:17:09,251 --> 01:17:10,395
Abner, check the yard.

808
01:17:10,419 --> 01:17:11,839
Woodrow, take the south side.

809
01:17:12,004 --> 01:17:14,014
Sheriff, can you get your men to spread out?

810
01:17:14,172 --> 01:17:16,453
We need to call in a chopper,
because this dragon can fly.

811
01:17:17,676 --> 01:17:18,986
A dragon?

812
01:17:19,761 --> 01:17:22,021
Jack, you dragged me all the way
out here for a dragon?

813
01:17:22,188 --> 01:17:24,250
I don't know how to explain it,
but he's telling the truth.

814
01:17:24,374 --> 01:17:25,384
It was here.

815
01:17:29,896 --> 01:17:31,196
It's still in there.

816
01:17:31,564 --> 01:17:32,724
What?
The dragon.

817
01:17:32,899 --> 01:17:34,545
The dragon is still in there.

818
01:17:35,070 --> 01:17:36,453
We have to help them.

819
01:17:41,533 --> 01:17:43,043
How do we get him out of here?

820
01:17:43,952 --> 01:17:45,412
Do you know how to drive?

821
01:17:46,663 --> 01:17:47,663
Sort of,

822
01:17:47,748 --> 01:17:49,708
but my dad's truck doesn't
have this many buttons.

823
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,590
Stop what you're doing, young lady.

824
01:17:51,952 --> 01:17:54,082
Your feet don't even reach the pedals.
Scoot over.

825
01:17:54,446 --> 01:17:55,446
Wait!

826
01:17:58,133 --> 01:18:00,013
I don't want to hurt your friend, son.

827
01:18:00,793 --> 01:18:02,073
I just want to help.

828
01:18:05,866 --> 01:18:06,866
Get in.

829
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:20,260
Okay, let's see here if this

830
01:18:26,620 --> 01:18:27,620
Hey, old buddy.

831
01:18:30,248 --> 01:18:31,878
You better buckle up.

832
01:18:34,544 --> 01:18:35,754
Hold on tight!

833
01:18:47,099 --> 01:18:48,599
I thought I put it in reverse.

834
01:18:54,898 --> 01:18:56,188
Oh, my...

835
01:18:58,318 --> 01:18:59,668
That isn't real, is it?

836
01:19:00,445 --> 01:19:02,155
Follow that dragon!

837
01:19:04,408 --> 01:19:06,278
Hey! Hey!

838
01:19:06,451 --> 01:19:07,621
Sorry about that.

839
01:19:24,386 --> 01:19:26,836
Tell that dragon to hang on.

840
01:19:27,260 --> 01:19:28,560
We've got company.

841
01:19:34,855 --> 01:19:36,290
Attention all units.

842
01:19:36,614 --> 01:19:38,590
We're eastbound on Millhaven Road,

843
01:19:38,715 --> 01:19:41,149
in pursuit of a...
A dragon! It's a dragon!

844
01:19:41,319 --> 01:19:43,159
You can't say dragon over the radio.

845
01:20:10,557 --> 01:20:11,557
Elliot!

846
01:20:13,101 --> 01:20:14,351
Fly!

847
01:20:25,489 --> 01:20:26,489
Come on.

848
01:20:33,038 --> 01:20:34,158
Faster!

849
01:20:45,300 --> 01:20:46,380
That's Meacham!

850
01:20:46,551 --> 01:20:47,591
Pull over!

851
01:20:47,677 --> 01:20:48,677
Hey, pull over!

852
01:20:48,845 --> 01:20:50,255
Not a chance!

853
01:20:50,430 --> 01:20:51,770
That's my dragon!

854
01:21:09,366 --> 01:21:10,526
He's not slowing down.

855
01:21:10,575 --> 01:21:11,655
He's not stopping.

856
01:21:11,743 --> 01:21:12,833
He'll stop.

857
01:21:13,094 --> 01:21:15,034
That fool's out of his mind.

858
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,920
Stop!
I'm trying.

859
01:21:21,586 --> 01:21:22,836
He ain't that crazy.

860
01:21:23,004 --> 01:21:24,844
Okay, hang on tight.

861
01:21:25,006 --> 01:21:26,686
We're going to have to do this another way.

862
01:22:11,970 --> 01:22:13,770
Elliot! No!

863
01:22:15,140 --> 01:22:16,310
Hey!

864
01:22:22,147 --> 01:22:23,517
Elliot! No!

865
01:22:43,001 --> 01:22:44,001
Jack.

866
01:22:47,964 --> 01:22:49,054
Stop!

867
01:22:49,174 --> 01:22:50,344
You have to stop!

868
01:22:57,515 --> 01:22:58,515
Jack!

869
01:22:58,683 --> 01:23:00,363
They're not gonna hurt us.

870
01:23:00,587 --> 01:23:01,426
Please!

871
01:23:01,427 --> 01:23:03,247
Stop! Elliot, stop!

872
01:23:03,313 --> 01:23:05,333
Don't hurt them! I need them!

873
01:23:08,693 --> 01:23:10,323
I need them.

874
01:23:16,701 --> 01:23:17,831
Jack, get out of there!

875
01:23:17,994 --> 01:23:19,914
Gavin?
Break the glass!

876
01:23:21,247 --> 01:23:22,247
Come on, I got ya!

877
01:23:26,127 --> 01:23:27,167
Come on, Elliot!

878
01:23:27,253 --> 01:23:28,713
Daddy!
Fly!

879
01:23:45,897 --> 01:23:47,437
Let's go. Go!

880
01:23:49,526 --> 01:23:50,526
Come on!

881
01:24:08,211 --> 01:24:09,301
Daddy!

882
01:24:10,588 --> 01:24:11,588
No, Grace.

883
01:24:12,465 --> 01:24:13,715
Come on, Elliot.

884
01:24:19,723 --> 01:24:20,723
Come on.

885
01:25:49,687 --> 01:25:50,687
I know.

886
01:25:52,357 --> 01:25:53,357
I know.

887
01:25:55,735 --> 01:25:56,815
Pete.

888
01:25:58,822 --> 01:26:00,662
Pete! Wait!

889
01:27:25,491 --> 01:27:27,951
We can't stay here anymore.

890
01:27:36,336 --> 01:27:37,865
People know you're here.

891
01:27:38,890 --> 01:27:40,780
They'll come looking for you.

892
01:28:14,332 --> 01:28:15,962
But I can't disappear.

893
01:29:38,750 --> 01:29:40,630
But I don't want to leave you.

894
01:31:31,529 --> 01:31:32,699
Honey, look.

895
01:32:36,886 --> 01:32:39,596
<font color="#00ffff"><i>No one ever
saw that dragon again.</i></font>

896
01:32:39,764 --> 01:32:42,314
<font color="#00ffff"><i>And I never told another tale about it.</i></font>

897
01:32:42,475 --> 01:32:43,624
<font color="#00ffff"><i>I didn't have to.</i></font>

898
01:32:43,849 --> 01:32:45,199

899
01:32:47,271 --> 01:32:48,780

900
01:32:48,881 --> 01:32:50,671
<font color="#00ffff"><i>it was nowhere to be found.</i></font>

901
01:32:52,276 --> 01:32:53,816

902
01:32:54,145 --> 01:32:55,635

903
01:32:56,739 --> 01:32:58,949
<font color="#00ffff"><i>But those were just stories.</i></font>

904
01:33:00,576 --> 01:33:02,516
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Time marched on.</i></font>

905
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:04,790

907
01:33:07,690 --> 01:33:09,195

909

910
01:33:15,132 --> 01:33:16,576
<font color="#00ffff"><i>But I know someone,</i></font>

911
01:33:17,001 --> 01:33:19,256
<font color="#00ffff"><i>who would tell you otherwise.</i></font>

912
01:33:29,272 --> 01:33:30,362
<font color="#00ffff"><i>There's one little boy</i></font>

913
01:33:30,881 --> 01:33:32,731
<font color="#00ffff"><i>who could tell you the whole story.</i></font>

914
01:33:33,192 --> 01:33:35,852
<font color="#00ffff"><i>He could even tell you
what happens next.</i></font>

915
01:33:36,654 --> 01:33:39,774
<font color="#00ffff"><i>He knows that the North Star

916
01:33:40,658 --> 01:33:43,238
<font color="#00ffff"><i>He knows that there's
magic in the woods,</i></font>

917
01:33:43,427 --> 01:33:45,637
