1
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,431
Who are you?

2
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:33,610
What is this?

3
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:37,281
Your majesty, caught him up
In a fishing net. A fishing net.

4
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:39,366
Sire, he's been telling stories.
Stories that...

5
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,410
We believe he's found a...

6
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,336
Ponce de León.

7
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:55,799
Says he found
Ponce de León's ship.

8
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:58,677
- Or sailed on it.
- No, I told you,

9
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,096
Ponce de León died 200 years ago.

10
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:04,766
Aye, but he died searching
For something, didn't he?

11
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:09,188
The fountain of youth.

12
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,069
How soon can you sail?

13
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:19,489
With the tide.

14
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:38,759
Over here!
Lucky heather!

15
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:41,970
Pirate swords! Pirate swords!

16
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:45,515
Pirate's execution today.
Watch him swing!

17
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:47,517
Pirate puppets!

18
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,186
Take that, you!

19
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,146
Hurry, Papa, or we'll miss the hanging!

20
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:54,983
It's not a hanging, dear, it's a trial.
The hanging comes this afternoon.

21
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,777
Pirate hanging today!

22
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,615
Come on. Up you get.

23
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,493
Move along, pirate.

24
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,038
Or should I say, "captain pirate"?

25
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,417
Come on. Come on! Up you go.

26
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,419
Quiet! Order!

27
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,297
Quiet!

28
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:19,883
Now appearing before the court,

29
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:23,262
The notorious and infamous
Pirate, pillager,

30
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,805
- And highwayman...
- Quiet!

31
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,640
...captain Jack Sparrow!

32
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:34,398
I told you, the name's Gibbs!
Joshamee Gibbs!

33
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,358
- How many times...
- Hear ye, hear ye!

34
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:37,818
Presiding over these trials,

35
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:43,573
All rise and attend,
The right honorable justice smith!

36
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,127
My dear sir.

37
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:00,048
Quiet!

38
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,677
Now...

39
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:07,055
...what do we have here?

40
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:08,515
Jack?

41
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,142
Shut up!

42
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:11,935
I don't recognize him.

43
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:15,272
Not necessary. You were saying?

44
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,066
Jack Sparrow is not my name.

45
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:20,110
My name is Joshamee Gibbs.

46
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,987
Is that so?

47
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:25,157
- It says Jack Sparrow here.
- I told 'em.

48
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,452
I'm not Jack Sparrow, who I would
Be happy to identify to the court

49
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:31,496
- If it would help my case.
- I think that would be a poor defense,

50
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:34,333
Unless you want to be bludgeoned again
Like a harp seal.

51
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,627
The prisoner claims of being innocent

52
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:40,172
To being Jack Sparrow. How do you find?

53
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,050
No trial? But aren't we here
To examine the evidence...

54
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:45,719
Foreman, your finding. Guilty?

55
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,721
Guilty verdict means he'll hang.

56
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,558
Hang him! String him up!

57
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,355
- Guilty?
- That's not fair!

58
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:57,731
Shut it.

59
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:02,778
Joshamee Gibbs, the crime ofwhich
You've been found guilty of

60
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:05,655
Is being innocent of being Jack Sparrow.

61
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,200
I hereby commute your sentence,

62
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,994
And order that you be imprisoned
For the remainder

63
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:13,997
Of your miserable, moribund,
Mutton-chopped life.

64
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,083
- What?!
- Hang him!

65
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,417
- Hang him!
- There.

66
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:20,921
- Balderdash!
- String him up! Hang him high!

67
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,217
Means shall be arranged
To transport this prisoner

68
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,386
To the tower of london.

69
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,190
Thanks very much.

70
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:45,779
Ta.

71
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:52,202
Come on. Get up there.

72
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,331
Get up!

73
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:04,673
Hell's teeth.
Now we're both headed for prison.

74
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,509
Not to worry.
I've paid off the driver.

75
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:11,012
Ten minutes, we'll be outside
London town, horses waiting.

76
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,681
Tonight, we make the coast.

77
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,183
Then it's just a matter
Of finding a ship.

78
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:19,104
- All part of the plan, yes?
- Exactly.

79
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,189
I arrived in london town
Just this morning

80
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:24,484
To rescue one Joshamee Gibbs
From one appointment with the gallows.

81
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,403
Seeing as how you're still alive,

82
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:29,281
I'd say it's all been
Very successful thus far.

83
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,158
What happened to you, Gibbs?

84
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:33,869
I thought you were employed elsewhere
Or otherwise engaged.

85
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:37,497
Aye. But I always listened like a thief
For news of the black pearl.

86
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:40,083
Nobody's seen where
She might next make port.

87
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:42,294
Then, I hear a rumor:

88
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,922
Jack Sparrow's in london
With a ship and looking for a crew.

89
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,799
- Am not.
- But that's what I heard.

90
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,177
Fact is, you're signing up men tonight.

91
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:51,845
Pub called the captain's daughter.

92
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:55,223
- Am not!
- Well, I thought it a bit odd,

93
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:59,060
But then, you've never been
The most predictable of sorts.

94
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,229
Tell me something.

95
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:04,900
There is another Jack Sparrow out there
Sullying my good name?

96
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:07,194
- An impostor.
- Indeed.

97
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:11,072
But... An impostor with a ship.

98
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,783
And in need of a crew.

99
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,952
Which, as fate would have it, so am i.

100
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,580
What about you, Jack?

101
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:22,584
Last I heard, you were hell-bent
To find the fountain of youth.

102
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,252
Any luck?

103
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,257
Circumstances arose
And forced a compelling insight

104
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,384
Regarding discretion and valor.

105
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:34,638
- Meaning, you gave up.
- I did not.

106
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:37,599
I am just as bent as ever.
Hellishly so.

107
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:42,562
I shall taste those waters,
Master Gibbs. Mark my words.

108
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,358
Short trip.

109
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:58,328
All part of the plan, yes?

110
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:02,541
No.

111
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,049
You are Jack Sparrow?

112
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:36,760
There should be a "captain"
In there somewhere.

113
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,429
I've heard of you.

114
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,640
And you know who I am.

115
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:45,226
Face is familiar.
Have I threatened you before?

116
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:49,147
You are in the presence of George
Augustus, duke of brunswick-luneburg,

117
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:52,150
Archtreasurer and prince-elector
Of the holy roman empire,

118
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,695
King of great britain and ireland,
And of you.

119
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,532
- Doesn't ring a bell.
- I am informed

120
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:04,120
You have come to london
To procure a crew for your ship.

121
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:06,414
Vicious rumor. Not true.

122
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:09,668
Then you lied to me when you
Told me you were Jack Sparrow.

123
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:13,046
I am Jack Sparrow,
But I'm not here to procure a crew.

124
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:15,590
That is... Someone else.

125
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:20,303
Someone else named Jack Sparrow.

126
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:23,223
You've brought me the wrong wastrel.

127
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:26,643
Find the proper one
And dispose of this impostor.

128
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,853
No, wait, wait, wait. Hang on a minute.

129
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,398
I'm Jack Sparrow, the one and only.

130
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:33,233
And I am in london.

131
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,443
To procure a crew.

132
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,278
To undertake a voyage

133
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:38,863
- To the fountain...
- What?

134
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:43,576
Will someone please remove
These infernal chains?

135
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:44,869
Come, come.

136
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,749
We know you're in possession of a map.

137
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:53,044
So confiscate the map,
And to the gallows with him!

138
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,046
Have you a map?

139
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,429
- No.
- Where is it?

140
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:06,266
The truth? I lost it.

141
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:10,395
- Quite recently, in fact.
- I have a report.

142
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:14,149
The spanish have located
The fountain of youth.

143
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:19,404
I will not have some
Melancholy spanish monarch,

144
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:24,159
A catholic, gain eternal life!

145
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,663
You do know the way to the fountain?

146
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,957
Of course I do.
Look at me.

147
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,959
You could guide an expedition.

148
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,630
With your permission, your heinie,

149
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:40,175
You will be providing, then, a ship...

150
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,428
...and a crew?

151
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,097
And a captain.

152
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:03,948
Afternoon, sire.

153
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:09,329
If I may be so bold,
Why is that man not in chains?

154
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,372
He must be manacled at once.

155
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:15,126
At the center of my palace? Hardly.

156
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,420
Hector.

157
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:21,049
How nice to see a fellow pirate
Make good of himself.

158
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:24,344
Pirate? Nay. Privateer.

159
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:30,058
On a sanctioned mission under the
Authority and protection of the crown.

160
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:33,686
As may be, but first,

161
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:36,022
What has become of my beloved pearl?

162
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,275
I lost the pearl as I lost my leg.

163
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:41,694
- Lost the pearl?
- Aye.

164
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:45,740
I defended her mightily enough,
But she be sunk nonetheless.

165
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:55,875
If that ship be sunk properly,
You should be sunk with it.

166
00:13:56,043 --> 00:14:01,297
Captain Barbossa, each second we tarry,
The spanish outdistance us.

167
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:04,884
I have every confidence
You will prevail and be rewarded

168
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:07,345
With the high station you so desire.

169
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:12,267
- To serve doth suffice, sire.
- You, sir, have stooped.

170
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,728
Jack, our sands be all but run.

171
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:19,190
Where's the harm
In joining the winning side?

172
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:23,111
And you do meet
A nicer class of person.

173
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,655
I understand everything.

174
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,366
Except that wig.

175
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,834
He's getting away!
Stop him!

176
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:41,588
- Head him off!
- No! Stop that pirate!

177
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:04,569
Come down!

178
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:18,249
- He escaped?
- Leave it to me, sire.

179
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:27,091
Guards! Guards!

180
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,367
- Arms at ready!
- Aye, sir!

181
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,833
Find him!

182
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,565
Finders keepers!

183
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:25,942
There!

184
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:50,758
Is that it?

185
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,432
Halt! Stop that carriage!

186
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,850
Head him off!

187
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:09,485
Out of the way!

188
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:38,514
Stop that pirate!

189
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:42,226
Move out of the way!

190
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:50,193
Stop that man!

191
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:52,862
Don't let him get away!

192
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,121
Fire!

193
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:33,736
He's getting away!
After him! Stop him!

194
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:38,616
After him!

195
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,379
Filthy pirate.

196
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:03,641
Hello, Jackie.

197
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,854
Hello, dad.

198
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,447
I heard you're putting together a crew.

199
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:21,450
If enough people keep saying it,
It must be true.

200
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:24,370
I heard where you're headed.
The fountain.

201
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:25,997
Have you been there?

202
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:30,168
Does this face look like
It's been to the fountain of youth?

203
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:34,797
- Depends on the light.
- Son, the fountain.

204
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:38,759
There'll be items required
For the profane ritual.

205
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:40,553
Two chalices.

206
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:44,724
- On the map there was a chalice.
- Two, silver.

207
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:47,727
From the ponce de León ship.
You'll need both.

208
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:51,480
- For?
- The ritual. Don't be a fool, Jackie.

209
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:54,692
Find out every detail
Before you set sail.

210
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,694
Oh, set sail. Love to.

211
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,071
But for that, I may need a ship.

212
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:02,491
Those folk, over there,
They have a ship.

213
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:05,203
They're signing up sailors right now.

214
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,538
My heart is pierced by cupid

215
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,665
I disdain all glittering gold

216
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,168
And one last thing, Jackie.

217
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:16,881
The fountain will test you.
Mark my words.

218
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,341
My heart is pierced by cupid

219
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:20,426
I disdain all glittering gold

220
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:23,304
There is nothing can console me

221
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:26,057
But my jolly sailor bold

222
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:41,405
I hear you be recruiting a crew.

223
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,616
Aye. That is,

224
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:47,536
Jack Sparrow be putting together
A modest venture.

225
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,624
You got some nerve, ain't ya?

226
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,292
Turning up here dressed like that?

227
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,419
What are you, some kind of impostor?

228
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,755
Have you any idea who I am, mate?

229
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:01,550
Oi, muckers!

230
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:04,303
There's a bloke here what's
Forgotten his own name!

231
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,350
Lads, I'm sailing with Sparrow.

232
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,269
Who'll buy a sailor a drink?

233
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:14,897
Who's next?

234
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:26,409
Bring us some more of those ones.

235
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:28,744
Yeah, make it four.

236
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:41,340
You've stolen me,
And I'm here to take meself back.

237
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,125
Stop doing that.

238
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:51,095
Only one person alive knows that move.

239
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,980
Always wanted to do that.

240
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,691
Hello, Angelica.

241
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:09,989
Hello, Jack. Are you impressed?

242
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:13,325
I think I almost killed you
Once or twice there.

243
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:17,538
I'm touched at this most
Sincerest form of flattery.

244
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:21,208
But why?

245
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:24,003
You were the only pirate
I thought I would pass for.

246
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:25,880
That is not a compliment.

247
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:31,969
Don't worry, Jack.
I forgave you a long time ago.

248
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:37,266
- For what? For leaving you?
- Recall that I left you.

249
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:41,312
A gentleman allows a lady
To maintain her fictions.

250
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,982
Look, Sparrow. As long as
My sailors get their money,

251
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:49,153
They're willing to put up with
Any number of peculiarities.

252
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:52,990
There is one peculiarity
With which I will not put up with.

253
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:56,702
I will be impersonated as "captain."
Nothing less.

254
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,871
Well, for that, you need a ship,

255
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,499
And as it turns out, I have one.

256
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:04,376
I could use a ship.

257
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:07,254
I hear tell you've been to the fountain.

258
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:09,548
There be a lot of hear-telling
Going on these days.

259
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:14,220
- The fountain of youth.
- Dearest Angelica, fret not.

260
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:17,097
You still have a few usable years left.

261
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:20,601
Always so charming.

262
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:21,852
You didn't answer me.

263
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,563
Aye. Regarding the fountain.
Waste of time, really...

264
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:28,317
Milady, I see unseamanlike fellows
Of an officious-looking nature.

265
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:31,111
Wretched pirates!
Find 'em! Maggots!

266
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,492
Friends of yours?

267
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,286
I may have unintentionally
Slighted some king or other.

268
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:41,205
Open it!

269
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,999
- Yeah, you haven't changed.
- Implying the need?

270
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:45,501
Yes.

271
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:47,336
Open this door,
In the name of his majesty.

272
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:50,839
You betrayed me.
You seduced me and you used me.

273
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:52,716
I was innocent of the ways of men.

274
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:56,136
You demonstrated a lot of technique
For someone I supposedly corrupted.

275
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:59,056
Imminent danger. Here, now, milady!

276
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,766
Open it!

277
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:04,520
I was ready to take my vows. And you...

278
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:07,314
What were you doing in
A spanish convent, anyway?

279
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:10,192
Mistook it for a brothel.
Honest mistake.

280
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:15,781
- There he is!
- Over there!

281
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:36,135
We are at a disadvantage.

282
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:39,680
Speak for yourself.
Unlike some who pretend to be,

283
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:41,599
But cannot, in fact, hold a candle to,

284
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:43,183
I am captain Jack Sparrow.

285
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,973
How can you say I used you?

286
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:25,309
You know exactly how.

287
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:28,562
I know, but how can you say it?

288
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:36,737
- So, what is it?
- What is what?

289
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:38,405
About the fountain.

290
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:42,034
What do you know?

291
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:45,579
You don't happen to be in possession

292
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:48,957
Of two silver chalices,
Circa ponce de León?

293
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:51,543
- No.
- Thought not.

294
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:55,297
- Why?
- I hear stories.

295
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:57,257
Rumors.

296
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:59,551
You are, of course, aware of the ritual.

297
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,595
Yes, I am.

298
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:06,684
What is it?
What is required?

299
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:13,273
A mermaid, Jack.

300
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:22,658
There's been a mistake.

301
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:26,328
It's a life sentence, not death. Life!

302
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:35,087
- Barbossa.
- Thank you, gentlemen.

303
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:38,215
I trust you can tie a noose.

304
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:39,758
That's a hard thing,

305
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:42,886
Forcing a man to twist
His own hanging rope.

306
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:46,557
You must lie in your bed
The way you made it.

307
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:49,768
What's happened to you?

308
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:53,313
- Where be Jack Sparrow?
- He escaped.

309
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:54,898
I'm on a tight schedule, Gibbs.

310
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:57,401
The hms providence
Sets sail at first light.

311
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,695
If you do not care to watch it
Hanging here dead,

312
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:01,864
With a mouth full of flies...

313
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:05,159
...speak now.

314
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:09,371
Take me with you.
Any point of the compass...

315
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:14,334
Take you where, Gibbs?
The fountain? Aye?

316
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:17,504
Is that where Jack be headed?

317
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:21,675
Have you anything
You can offer me, Gibbs?

318
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:23,343
Anything at all?

319
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:28,640
Upon me naked word,
You'll not see the dawn.

320
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:38,400
Hand it over.

321
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,449
- You fool!
- I had just enough time

322
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:48,076
To study those infernal circles.

323
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:52,873
Every route, every destination.
All safe... In here.

324
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:58,378
Welcome back to his majesty's navy,
Master Gibbs.

325
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:13,477
Show a leg, sailor!

326
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:14,853
Aye, sir.

327
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:17,689
What?

328
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:21,026
- There's been a horrible mistake.
- Keep moving.

329
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:25,489
- I'm not supposed to be here.
- Many a man's woken up at sea,

330
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,574
No idea what, when, wherefore or why.

331
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:29,952
No memory of the night afore,
Whence he signed up

332
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:31,620
And drank away all his bonus money.

333
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,747
No, no, no. You don't understand, mate.

334
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:36,291
I'm captain Jack Sparrow.
The original. The only.

335
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:39,002
Scrum, and the pleasure's all mine.
Now, keep moving.

336
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:48,971
Scrum.

337
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:51,348
Get your elbows in!

338
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:55,727
Why is there a glass coffin?

339
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:58,313
Do I look like a man in charge?

340
00:30:58,481 --> 00:31:01,400
- Where am i?
- 'scuse me, captain Sparrow, sir.

341
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:03,193
I be right honored
To welcome you aboard

342
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:06,613
Our world-renowned vessel of infamy,
Queen anne's revenge.

343
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,660
Blackbeard.

344
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,887
Work!

345
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:37,436
- He's a curious one.
- He's been zombiefied.

346
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,230
Zombiefied.

347
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:43,859
Blackbeard's doing.
All the officers are the same.

348
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:45,736
Makes 'em more compliant.

349
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,989
And perpetually ill-tempered.

350
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,285
- Come on. Scrub.
- Yeah.

351
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:04,004
Pull! Pull! Pull!

352
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:11,094
Five days underway, at least.

353
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:15,057
Aye. You can tell that
By the smell of the sea?

354
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:16,934
Smell of the crew.

355
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:23,607
Oi. What did that poor sod do?

356
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,776
And how can I make sure to not?

357
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,236
Him? Churchly fellow.

358
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:30,405
Always going on about the lord almighty.

359
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:32,282
Bible-thumper on this ship?

360
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,326
A missionary is his story.

361
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:37,204
What I heard was
He got captured in a raid.

362
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:40,207
Rest of the ship got killed,
But not 'im.

363
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:41,667
First mate wouldn't let it happen

364
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:44,503
On account of his premier standing
With the lord.

365
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:49,049
A first mate sticking her neck out
For some prisoner.

366
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,801
That you don't see.

367
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,637
"her"? First mate is a "her"?

368
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,013
Back to work!

369
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:06,566
Steady as she goes.

370
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:25,168
You are a ruthless,
Soulless, cross-grained cur.

371
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:28,797
- I told you I had a ship.
- No, Blackbeard has a ship,

372
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:31,758
Upon which I am now imprisoned.

373
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:33,885
We can do this, Jack.

374
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:38,598
The fountain of youth,
Like you always wanted.

375
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:43,854
Blackbeard. Edward teach.
The pirate all pirates fear.

376
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,148
Resurrector of the dead
In his spare time.

377
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:49,151
- He will listen to me.
- He listens to no one.

378
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:52,195
Maybe to his own daughter?

379
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:57,659
Daughter as in... Beget by?

380
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:02,372
Long-lost. Recently found.

381
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:06,334
Who loves her dear papa
With all her soul.

382
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:08,545
- He bought that?
- I sold that.

383
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:17,804
Then it's the fountain of youth for him,

384
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:20,807
Or him and you, not you and me.

385
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:23,018
No, Jack, that's the best part.

386
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:25,228
He will be dead.

387
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,940
You'll be handling
That part yourself, then?

388
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:31,318
There is a prophecy.

389
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,653
Maybe you don't believe
In the supernatural.

390
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:36,281
Oh, no, no.
I've seen a thing or two.

391
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:42,829
The prophecy is this:

392
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:46,792
Blackbeard will meet his death
Within a fortnight

393
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:50,378
At the hands of a one-legged man.

394
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:52,714
That's why he needs the fountain, Jack.

395
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:11,817
Master Gibbs, short we are a map.

396
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:15,028
Perhaps you'd be so kind
As to provide us an heading.

397
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:20,909
Be a gem and pour me a gulper.

398
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:24,496
Nay. We be privateers,
Not pirates, master Gibbs.

399
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:26,748
And in the king's name,
We behave as such.

400
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:29,709
Aye, captain.

401
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:35,924
Be we on the proper course, Gibbs?

402
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:40,679
Aye, it be proper. There's your proof.

403
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:48,478
The spaniard.

404
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:54,776
All hands! Battle stations!
Get to windward!

405
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:57,988
- All hands, windward!
- Harden up two points!

406
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:01,575
- Two points!
- Cast loose the cannons!

407
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:09,291
- Gunners, take posts!
- Take position! Gunners ready, sir!

408
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:13,295
- Out! Thrust!
- Await orders.

409
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:16,756
Steady!

410
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:19,718
Guns armed, awaiting orders, sir.

411
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:29,060
Sir. Orders, sir?

412
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:38,403
He never so much as turned his head.

413
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:40,405
The fountain is the prize.

414
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:44,159
It appears we be not even worth
The time it'd take to sink us.

415
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:48,205
And now we've fallen behind.
All hands, make more sail!

416
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:50,916
All hands, more sail!

417
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:54,377
Ride hard between wind and tide!

418
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:07,974
The topic, gentlemen, is mutiny.

419
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,518
Mutiny most foul.

420
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:14,189
Aye. I signed up to sail
Under Jack Sparrow, not some pretender.

421
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:15,607
And a lady, at that.

422
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,943
And mention was failed to
Be made of this uncanny crew.

423
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:20,445
Make my toes curl, they do.

424
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:23,657
I got 'em. All of them.

425
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:25,742
- Well done.
- Good lad.

426
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,328
On to it, then. Blackbeard.

427
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:30,914
- What are his habits?
- Stays mostly to his cabin.

428
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,833
That's right, mostly to his cabin.

429
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:37,170
- Yes, but when he comes out...
- He don't really come out.

430
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:40,507
He must come out sometime.

431
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:43,593
Not really, no.

432
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:47,138
Any of you sail with him before?

433
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:48,723
- No, no.
- I've never.

434
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:49,891
Definitely not.

435
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:53,895
- Any of you seen him before?
- Not really, no.

436
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,691
Stays to his cabin,
No one sailed with him,

437
00:37:57,858 --> 00:37:59,859
No one's seen him...

438
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:03,029
Good news, gentlemen.
This is not Blackbeard's ship.

439
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:04,990
This is not the queen anne's revenge.

440
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:07,158
No, this be the queen anne's revenge,
Right enough.

441
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:08,743
How do you know?

442
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:12,163
I've seen the name,
On the back of the ship.

443
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:20,380
Gentlemen, sirs, fellow conscriptees...

444
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,217
...you have been monstrously deceived.

445
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:28,513
- We are decepted, then?
- Yes.

446
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:31,558
You've nay been informed
Of a destination.

447
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:33,852
Death lies before us

448
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:38,815
As we sail for the fountain of youth.

449
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:42,319
It would be a sorry plight, mates.

450
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:46,573
- Death, for certain.
- The garden of darkened souls.

451
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:50,076
- Untimely our ends will be.
- Unless...

452
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:52,746
...we take the ship.

453
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:57,584
We take the ship, then. Now!

454
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,340
Go on, then.

455
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:06,760
- Help me, shipmates!
- Give it to 'em!

456
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:09,137
- Wake up! It's ours!
- Come on!

457
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:10,930
Get up! Off your backside!

458
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:14,851
- Get off your fannies!
- Take it to them, lads!

459
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,811
Help me! Fight!

460
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:31,785
Jack.

461
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:38,041
If this is a dream,
You can keep the sword and boots on.

462
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,712
- If it's not...
- It's a dream.

463
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:49,386
No, it's not!

464
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:53,264
I thought I should give you
Fair warning, we're taking the ship.

465
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:55,809
Nothing personal.

466
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:58,770
Think you might be better off
If you just...

467
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:01,731
...stay out of it.

468
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:26,631
Boggit.

469
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:49,529
Wretch!

470
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:21,144
You're either with us or against us!

471
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,480
I am not with you,
Neither am I against you!

472
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:24,981
Can he do that?

473
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:28,151
He's religious.
I believe it's required.

474
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:36,784
Fight to the bitter end,
You cack-handed deck apes!

475
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:51,007
Take him, men.
Tie him down tight!

476
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:07,482
The ship is ours!

477
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:38,555
Gentlemen.

478
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:49,482
I be placed in a bewilderment.

479
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:54,279
There I were, resting,

480
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:59,075
And upon a sudden,
I hear an ungodly row on deck.

481
00:43:02,162 --> 00:43:04,080
Sailors abandon their posts

482
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:06,749
Without orders, without leave.

483
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:11,087
Men before the mast,

484
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:13,631
Taking the ship for themselves.

485
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:17,677
What be that, first mate?

486
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:20,680
- Mutiny, captain.
- Again?

487
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:23,808
- Mutiny!
- Aye.

488
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:26,060
Mutiny.

489
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:32,025
And what fate befalls mutineers?

490
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:35,695
Now, we know the answer to that,
Do we not?

491
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:39,407
Mutineers hang!

492
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:30,958
Captain, I wish to report a mutiny.

493
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,087
I can name fingers and point names.

494
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:35,713
No need, mr. Sparrow.

495
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:39,092
They are sheep. You, their shepherd.

496
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:46,683
Have I mentioned, sir,
What a lovely daughter you have?

497
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,769
A fitting last sight for a doomed soul.

498
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:52,313
Remember, father.
We need him.

499
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:53,940
If I don't kill a man
Every now and then,

500
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:56,484
- They forget who I am.
- Coward!

501
00:44:58,153 --> 00:45:00,279
They do not forget.

502
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:02,824
Your crew sees you
For the miscreant you are.

503
00:45:02,991 --> 00:45:05,284
A coward, no matter how many you slay.

504
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:07,829
Twice in one day,
I find myself in a bewilderment.

505
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:10,123
You are not bewildered, you are afraid.

506
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:13,126
You dare not walk the path of
Righteousness, the way of the light.

507
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:17,505
No, sir. The truth is
It be much simpler than all that.

508
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:20,550
- I am a bad man.
- That, too.

509
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:22,677
I might have to kill you too, catechist.

510
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:25,430
- No!
- All latin blood like her mother.

511
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:27,640
Father, I beg you.

512
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:31,519
There I be again,
Forgetting why the missionary is here.

513
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:36,065
My daughter fears for my soul,
Or what's left of it.

514
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:40,737
You truly wish to save me, my child?

515
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:42,822
Every soul can be saved.

516
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,742
Be that true, young cleric?

517
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:49,579
Yes. Though you I see
As a bit of a long shot.

518
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:54,542
Still, I pray for every unfortunate soul
On this hell-bound vessel.

519
00:45:57,129 --> 00:45:59,756
You disarm me with your faith.

520
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:02,592
Eight bells!

521
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,720
Which of you unfortunate souls
Stood watch?

522
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:10,850
- I did. I stood watch.
- Gunner.

523
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:17,607
You?

524
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:22,236
Aye.

525
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:24,363
The cook.

526
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:27,366
Peerect. Lower the longboat!

527
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:34,624
Bring her about!

528
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:49,222
- Why do you do this?
- Mutiny. Our laws be clear.

529
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:51,641
Our laws allow the captain
To show leniency.

530
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:54,393
I have given this man
A chance to determine his fate,

531
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:56,229
A gift not afforded to all.

532
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:06,781
Oh, you now.

533
00:47:08,116 --> 00:47:10,701
Chance to show the worth
Of your prayers.

534
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:14,914
Pray he be delivered from... Evil?

535
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:24,590
Course made!

536
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:26,592
Stop. Give that man a chance.
Give yourself a...

537
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:54,912
You know when I feel closest
To our maker?

538
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,914
When I see suffering, pain and anguish.

539
00:47:57,082 --> 00:47:59,584
That's when the true design
Of this world is revealed.

540
00:47:59,751 --> 00:48:03,421
And I see it revealed when in times
Of hardship and tragedy,

541
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:05,840
Kindness and compassion
Are shown to those in need.

542
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:08,384
Perhaps you should pray
For him to be unharmed, yes?

543
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:10,720
- Please, there's still hope...
- Again!

544
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:26,027
I actually have no interest
In the fountain whatsoever,

545
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:28,029
So, if your heart is set,

546
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:30,364
You may drop me off
Anywhere you like.

547
00:48:30,532 --> 00:48:32,283
That'll be all, quartermaster.

548
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:38,789
Your words surround you like fog
And make you hard to see.

549
00:48:38,957 --> 00:48:42,752
And what of you,
The mighty Blackbeard?

550
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,671
Beheaded they say.
Still, your body swam

551
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:49,258
Three times around your ship,
Then climbed back onboard.

552
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:52,011
And here you are, running scared.

553
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:56,057
- Scared.
- To the fountain.

554
00:48:56,224 --> 00:48:59,226
The quartermaster
Sees things before they happen.

555
00:48:59,394 --> 00:49:03,856
He has foreseen my death,
And so the fates have spoken.

556
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:06,359
The threads of destiny woven.

557
00:49:06,526 --> 00:49:09,445
You have a ridiculously
High regard for fate, mate.

558
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:11,197
- And you?
- Me?

559
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:15,618
I'm skeptical of predicting
Any future... Which includes me.

560
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:21,540
It'd be foolish to battle fate,
But i'd be tempted to cheat it.

561
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:24,543
I will reach the fountain.
You will lead me.

562
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:31,008
That knife will serve you no better
Than the mutiny you devised.

563
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:32,927
Mutiny served me well.

564
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:35,012
It gained me an audience with you.

565
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:38,224
Aye.

566
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:41,435
To warn you.

567
00:49:42,437 --> 00:49:43,980
Regarding your first mate,

568
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:47,024
Who pretends to be persons she is not.

569
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:48,651
Do tell.

570
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:53,030
She is not your daughter.

571
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:59,370
You dare to speak
Thusly of my flesh and blood?

572
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:04,041
Sir, the woman is consummate
In the art of deception.

573
00:50:04,209 --> 00:50:08,629
I know. As I mostly unwittingly
Set her on her wicked path.

574
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:10,715
Though I cannot claim credit

575
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:13,801
For her existing abundance
Of natural talent.

576
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,305
Angelica.
My beloved daughter,

577
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:21,058
The one true good thing
I have done in this life,

578
00:50:21,226 --> 00:50:23,853
And you claim to be the one
Who corrupted her?

579
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:28,024
Sir, what she is is pure evil.

580
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:30,568
More to be feared than a wild beast.

581
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:34,530
Hungry wild beast with gnashing teeth.

582
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:36,699
Vengeful, hungry from hell beast...

583
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,993
- Father?
- Sweetness!

584
00:50:40,954 --> 00:50:42,496
No need to hurt him, father.

585
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:45,875
He will help us. Won't you, Jack?

586
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:49,754
You see? Even now,
She attends to your welfare,

587
00:50:49,921 --> 00:50:53,466
Giving lie to the claims
You make of her.

588
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:05,519
You will lead us to the fountain. Yes?

589
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:08,022
Put another way.

590
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:12,234
If I do not make it
To the fountain in time...

591
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:16,864
...neither will you.

592
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:23,162
I'll have a wee look-see at those charts
Straight away then, shall i?

593
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,167
Sir.

594
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:33,380
- Aye?
- Captain, sir,

595
00:51:33,548 --> 00:51:35,925
I am unhappy to report rumors, sir,

596
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:38,260
Among the crew,
As to our destination.

597
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:41,430
Shut your trap and make way.

598
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:49,063
- That's the way of it, then.
- No disrespect, sir.

599
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:52,691
What do the men fear?
Say it. Speak the words.

600
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:54,777
Whitecap bay.

601
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:58,030
Aye, whitecap bay.

602
00:51:58,198 --> 00:52:02,243
And every worthless seaman
Fears the name, and rightly so,

603
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:04,745
Though few know why or dare to ask.

604
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:06,539
Be the stories true?

605
00:52:06,706 --> 00:52:08,499
Say what robs you of
Your staunch heart, Gibbs,

606
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:11,794
Or forever leave it
To the wider fields of fancy.

607
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:16,090
Mermaids, captain.

608
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:18,008
Aye. Mermaids.

609
00:52:18,176 --> 00:52:22,304
Sea ghouls, devil fish,
Dreadful in hunger for flesh of man.

610
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:26,016
Mermaid waters, that be our path.

611
00:52:26,184 --> 00:52:27,726
Cling to your soul, Gibbs,

612
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:31,522
As mermaids be given
To take the rest...

613
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:33,065
...to the bone.

614
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:37,778
Steady! Steady, men!
Find your courage,

615
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:39,822
Or be ready to purpose your fear!

616
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:42,366
Save yourselves!

617
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:47,788
- Man overboard!
- Nay! A deserter.

618
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:49,707
- Come about.
- Nay!

619
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:54,795
Gentlemen, I shall not ask
Any more of any man than what

620
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:59,425
That man can deliver, but I do ask this:
Are we not king's men?

621
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:01,010
Aye.

622
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:03,929
- On the king's mission?
- Aye.

623
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:08,309
I did not note any fear in the eyes
Of the spanish as they passed us by.

624
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:11,187
- Are we not king's men?
- Aye!

625
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:14,273
Aye! Hands all off, and bear away!

626
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:17,359
Stave on ahead to whitecap bay!

627
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:21,363
Bear on, whitecap bay!

628
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:36,837
Come.

629
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:38,297
Little drink?

630
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:41,675
Wine, music, candlelight.

631
00:53:41,843 --> 00:53:44,053
I think we've traveled down
This road before, Jack.

632
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:46,013
Yes, we have.

633
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:48,390
I remember it well.

634
00:53:50,268 --> 00:53:55,064
Winding, twisting and
Turning, gyrating, writhing.

635
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:57,524
Incessant writhing.

636
00:53:57,692 --> 00:53:59,526
Do you recall saint dominique?

637
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:02,529
La martinique.

638
00:54:02,697 --> 00:54:04,365
I tried to kill you in saint dominique.

639
00:54:04,532 --> 00:54:06,283
Either or.

640
00:54:07,118 --> 00:54:09,119
Hardly appropriate for a first mate.

641
00:54:09,287 --> 00:54:12,706
Was I the first? I've often wondered.

642
00:54:12,874 --> 00:54:17,086
You can be so charming
When you want something, Jack.

643
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:19,713
The trick is finding out what.

644
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,925
The truth, then, is it?

645
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:26,136
Blackbeard has served his purpose.

646
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:28,597
You and I can go to
The fountain together,

647
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:31,809
Where we shall bathe one another
In equal shares of fame

648
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:33,978
And other assorted debaucheries.

649
00:54:34,145 --> 00:54:37,106
And i'll tell you
The ritual of the fountain.

650
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:40,067
Yes. The profane ritual.

651
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:44,989
Can I trust you, Jack?

652
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:49,535
- I need you on my side.
- Oh, my dearest Angelica.

653
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:53,122
You and I are as
Thick as thieves, love.

654
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:55,499
Tell me the rules.

655
00:54:57,669 --> 00:55:01,297
Water from the fountain of youth.

656
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:06,552
The shimmering tear of a mermaid.

657
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:10,014
The silver chalices of ponce de León.

658
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:13,684
With these items...

659
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:15,936
- Yes?
- With these items,

660
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:19,481
You may take all the years
Of life from another, Jack.

661
00:55:21,776 --> 00:55:23,569
You know what that means.

662
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:26,613
We cannot go alone, you and i.

663
00:55:26,781 --> 00:55:29,033
The ritual requires a victim.

664
00:55:30,785 --> 00:55:34,621
- That is unfortunate.
- Yes, it is.

665
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:38,500
I find my desire for the fountain
Greatly lessened.

666
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:42,546
But there is something onboard
You do want.

667
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:49,678
What about Blackbeard?

668
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:53,432
He's in the chart room.
We'll have to be quick.

669
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:05,110
He keeps each ship as a prize.

670
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:11,325
You help me,
And I promise you your pick.

671
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:14,870
Though I think I know the one
You will choose.

672
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:23,253
The black pearl in a bottle?

673
00:56:23,421 --> 00:56:25,130
Why is the black pearl in a bottle?

674
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:33,764
He's even more annoying in miniature.

675
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:37,935
- Do we have a deal, Jack?
- Angelica, I know you.

676
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:40,938
You are not going to steal the life
Of some innocent man.

677
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:43,816
What about the one-legged man?

678
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:47,694
I need years, Jack.

679
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:52,950
Not for me. For my father.

680
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:57,871
I am truly the daughter of Blackbeard.

681
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:01,083
You've fallen for your own con, love.

682
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:03,502
No, he is my father.

683
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:05,337
The lies I told you were not lies.

684
00:57:07,173 --> 00:57:10,008
You lied to me by telling me the truth?

685
00:57:10,176 --> 00:57:12,177
- Yes.
- That's very good.

686
00:57:12,345 --> 00:57:14,763
- May I use that?
- I'm sure you will, anyway.

687
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:17,266
Of course I will.

688
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:20,102
So, will you not give up this quest?

689
00:57:20,728 --> 00:57:23,856
I want a father, Jack.
I haven't had one.

690
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:28,360
Angelica, your father, Blackbeard...

691
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:31,280
...he is evil,

692
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:33,615
And he will kill you given the chance.

693
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:36,869
- He cannot be saved.
- And who are you to set

694
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:39,204
The limits on redemption?

695
00:57:39,372 --> 00:57:42,666
You stole years of my life, Jack.
You owe me.

696
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:45,878
And you are en route
To getting yourself killed,

697
00:57:46,045 --> 00:57:48,338
And I am not inclined
To stand by and watch.

698
00:57:48,506 --> 00:57:52,217
Whitecap bay!

699
00:57:57,348 --> 00:58:00,726
All hands on deck!
Set to the longboats!

700
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:05,814
Lay 'em out flat!

701
00:58:06,524 --> 00:58:11,278
No tangles. Make 'em look
Pretty for our dainty guests.

702
00:58:11,446 --> 00:58:15,240
We're gonna need light.
A lot of light.

703
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:18,035
Come!

704
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:45,062
Smell that? Whale oil.
Stuff burns like a miracle from god.

705
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:48,941
- Can you make it work?
- Made by the english.

706
00:58:49,108 --> 00:58:50,192
Let's not get our hopes up.

707
00:59:01,246 --> 00:59:03,163
The old moon in
The arms of the new one.

708
00:59:03,331 --> 00:59:04,540
First of the summer.

709
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:08,669
Peerect for hunting a mermaid's tear.

710
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:24,851
We're doomed.
They be drawn to man-made light.

711
00:59:25,019 --> 00:59:27,688
- Sharks?
- Worse than sharks, boy.

712
00:59:27,855 --> 00:59:30,357
There'll be mermaids upon us
Within the hour,

713
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:33,986
You mark my words.
And we're the bait.

714
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:42,286
I heard it said a kiss from a mermaid
Protects a sailor from drowning.

715
00:59:42,453 --> 00:59:46,290
Don't be a fool!
Mermaids are all female, son,

716
00:59:46,457 --> 00:59:49,209
And lovely as a dream of heaven.

717
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:53,630
But when it comes time
To churn butter, so to speak,

718
00:59:53,798 --> 00:59:55,757
They snatch a sailor out of a boat

719
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:58,927
Or off the deck of a ship,
Have their way,

720
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:04,016
And then the sailors are pulled
To bottom and drowned and eaten.

721
01:00:04,475 --> 01:00:07,894
Or, sometimes, the other way around.

722
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:11,815
- Sing.
- What?

723
01:00:13,192 --> 01:00:15,319
They like to hear singing.

724
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:23,243
My name is maria

725
01:00:23,411 --> 01:00:26,538
A merchant's daughterfair

726
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:30,292
- Louder.
- And I have left my parents

727
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:33,629
And 3,000 pounds a year

728
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:36,798
My heart is pierced by cupid

729
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:40,385
I disdain all glittering gold

730
01:00:40,553 --> 01:00:44,014
There is nothing can console me

731
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:47,059
But my jolly sailor bold

732
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:52,773
My heart is pierced by cupid

733
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:56,610
I disdain all glittering gold

734
01:00:56,778 --> 01:00:59,488
There is nothing can console me

735
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:04,117
But my jolly sailor bold

736
01:01:22,053 --> 01:01:23,553
Lord save me.

737
01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:30,268
Man, look. Look there.

738
01:01:31,145 --> 01:01:32,229
You'll scare her off!

739
01:01:32,397 --> 01:01:33,897
Aye, and good riddance!

740
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:40,570
Can you talk?

741
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:44,783
Yes.

742
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:53,792
You're beautiful.

743
01:01:54,627 --> 01:01:58,380
- Are you the one who sings?
- Aye.

744
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:03,719
Are you my jolly sailor bold?

745
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:08,181
- Aye, that I be.
- Scrum, comport yourself!

746
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:11,518
Boys! There ain't much
Been given to me

747
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:14,062
In my brief, miserable life,
There's the truth in it.

748
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:15,939
But, by god, i'll have it said

749
01:02:16,107 --> 01:02:19,484
That Scrum had himself a kiss
From a proper mermaid!

750
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:24,364
My heart is pierced by cupid

751
01:02:25,032 --> 01:02:28,034
I disdain all glittering gold

752
01:02:28,202 --> 01:02:31,580
There is nothing can console me

753
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:35,834
But my jolly sailor bold

754
01:02:37,336 --> 01:02:40,839
Come all ye pretty fair maids

755
01:02:41,674 --> 01:02:45,218
Whoever you may be

756
01:02:45,386 --> 01:02:48,930
Who love a jolly sailor bold

757
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:53,810
Thatploughs the raging sea

758
01:02:53,978 --> 01:02:58,064
My heart is pierced by cupid

759
01:02:58,232 --> 01:03:02,402
I disdain all glittering gold

760
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:06,740
There is nothing can console me

761
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:11,244
But my jolly sailor bold

762
01:03:11,412 --> 01:03:16,541
My heart is pierced by cupid

763
01:03:16,709 --> 01:03:19,920
I disdain all glittering gold

764
01:03:20,087 --> 01:03:24,132
There is nothing can console me

765
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:28,094
But my jolly sailor bold

766
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:07,259
Out upon it! It has begun!

767
01:04:49,135 --> 01:04:51,011
Light 'em up!

768
01:04:51,178 --> 01:04:55,724
Muster your courage!
Drive 'em to shore!

769
01:05:06,193 --> 01:05:09,613
Nets into the water! Quickly!

770
01:05:59,163 --> 01:06:02,499
Retreat, all, to land!
For your lives!

771
01:06:05,878 --> 01:06:07,253
Retreat, I say!

772
01:06:07,421 --> 01:06:09,422
Cowards! Back in the water!

773
01:06:09,590 --> 01:06:13,760
There be no refuge on land! On my word!

774
01:06:46,877 --> 01:06:48,420
Come on!

775
01:08:23,015 --> 01:08:25,183
We got one!

776
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:30,814
I'm in love!

777
01:08:33,567 --> 01:08:34,984
Check the wounded!

778
01:08:35,152 --> 01:08:37,904
See if you can find
One mermaid still alive!

779
01:09:17,236 --> 01:09:18,361
Come, give a hand!

780
01:09:19,613 --> 01:09:21,614
Well done, sailor.

781
01:09:22,616 --> 01:09:24,242
Did everyone see that?

782
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:26,411
Because I will not be doing it again.

783
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:31,249
Back to the ship.
We head for a protected cove. Now.

784
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:51,019
- Lord. Is that...?
- Mermaid.

785
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:54,689
- Give up this madness now.
- I cannot.

786
01:09:55,608 --> 01:09:56,608
Ever walk on the beach,

787
01:09:56,775 --> 01:09:59,027
Look back and see your footsteps
In the sand?

788
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:03,156
It's like that,
Except the footsteps lie before me.

789
01:10:03,324 --> 01:10:07,118
- Footstep, actually.
- Whitecap bay, sir.

790
01:10:07,286 --> 01:10:08,870
We must hasten.

791
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:20,548
We travel by foot.
Gibbs, I require a heading.

792
01:10:20,716 --> 01:10:23,843
- But, sir, the men.
- They be dead already.

793
01:10:24,011 --> 01:10:27,096
- They don't sound dead.
- Oh, is that so?

794
01:10:27,264 --> 01:10:31,559
Well, I hear nothing
But seagulls nesting.

795
01:10:31,727 --> 01:10:33,770
What is it that you hear, mr. Groves?

796
01:10:36,565 --> 01:10:40,235
Seagulls... Nesting.

797
01:10:40,402 --> 01:10:43,446
- Nothing more.
- Heading, Gibbs?

798
01:10:52,122 --> 01:10:53,665
My god.

799
01:10:53,832 --> 01:10:55,833
Your head or my heading.

800
01:10:56,001 --> 01:10:58,169
I'll have me one or t'other,
I don't care which.

801
01:11:03,384 --> 01:11:05,635
All hands, forward!

802
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:25,571
- It's to you now, Sparrow.
- Was that really necessary?

803
01:11:25,739 --> 01:11:28,366
Best you not know the exact
Whereabouts of my ship.

804
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:33,204
- I be a cautious man.
- So be i.

805
01:11:33,372 --> 01:11:35,081
What I want first...

806
01:11:38,669 --> 01:11:40,712
...is ponce de León's ship.

807
01:12:17,833 --> 01:12:19,625
Why is it we've got to bring her along?

808
01:12:19,793 --> 01:12:23,004
Because tears don't keep.
We need them fresh.

809
01:12:23,172 --> 01:12:25,882
What is the ritual again?

810
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:28,468
Water from the fountain
And a mermaid's tear?

811
01:12:28,635 --> 01:12:30,136
And two silver chalices.

812
01:12:30,304 --> 01:12:32,930
One cup with a tear, one without.

813
01:12:34,224 --> 01:12:36,601
So, one with a tear and water in both?

814
01:12:36,769 --> 01:12:38,269
Quite complicated, is it not?

815
01:12:38,437 --> 01:12:41,481
Both get water. One gets a tear.

816
01:12:41,648 --> 01:12:44,275
The person who drinks
The water with the tear

817
01:12:44,443 --> 01:12:46,903
Gets all the years of life
From the other.

818
01:12:48,113 --> 01:12:50,156
How many years?

819
01:12:51,617 --> 01:12:54,577
All the years
That they have lived,

820
01:12:54,745 --> 01:12:58,247
And they could have lived,
If fate had been kinder.

821
01:13:07,591 --> 01:13:08,841
Clergyman.

822
01:13:10,844 --> 01:13:13,763
On the off chance that this
Does not go well for me,

823
01:13:13,931 --> 01:13:15,473
I would like it noted here and now

824
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:18,851
That I am fully prepared
To believe in whatever I must,

825
01:13:19,019 --> 01:13:20,770
So that I may be
Welcomed into that place

826
01:13:20,938 --> 01:13:23,314
Where all the goody-goodies
Get to go. Savvy?

827
01:13:23,482 --> 01:13:27,110
We have a word for that, Jack.
You can convert.

828
01:13:27,277 --> 01:13:29,737
I was thinking more
Of an as-needed basis.

829
01:13:33,742 --> 01:13:34,992
Quartermaster!

830
01:13:35,619 --> 01:13:37,328
- Aye?
- She cannot breathe!

831
01:13:37,496 --> 01:13:40,540
- She has water.
- She needs air!

832
01:13:44,503 --> 01:13:46,421
- Open this.
- She will escape.

833
01:13:46,588 --> 01:13:50,299
- You're killing her.
- I support the missionary's position.

834
01:13:58,851 --> 01:13:59,892
See?

835
01:14:04,982 --> 01:14:06,649
Onward.

836
01:14:30,883 --> 01:14:34,302
Just as I thought. Not this way!

837
01:14:36,388 --> 01:14:37,805
This is the way, isn't it?

838
01:14:37,973 --> 01:14:40,766
'Course it is, but we
Should go around to the east.

839
01:14:40,934 --> 01:14:42,768
That would take us out of
The path of the chalices.

840
01:14:42,936 --> 01:14:44,687
- Well, then we'll circle back.
- There is no time.

841
01:14:44,855 --> 01:14:46,481
You're the one who insisted
On bringing the bloody mermaid.

842
01:14:46,648 --> 01:14:48,608
- Well, the mutiny didn't help.
- You walk like a girl.

843
01:14:48,775 --> 01:14:50,860
- You would know.
- Someone must go.

844
01:14:51,945 --> 01:14:53,446
You mean split up?

845
01:14:53,614 --> 01:14:56,491
You mean jump?
This I cannot wait to see.

846
01:14:56,658 --> 01:15:00,578
Sparrow will go.
Find the ship, retrieve the chalices.

847
01:15:00,746 --> 01:15:02,747
Sparrow? What makes you
Think he will come back?

848
01:15:02,915 --> 01:15:06,125
Yes, what makes you think
He will come back?

849
01:15:06,293 --> 01:15:08,753
We cannot trust him, father. I'll go.

850
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:11,339
She'll go.

851
01:15:15,385 --> 01:15:16,719
How much farther to the fountain?

852
01:15:16,887 --> 01:15:18,554
I'm running out of time.

853
01:15:20,557 --> 01:15:22,683
About a day's march north,
Following that river,

854
01:15:22,851 --> 01:15:26,312
You'll get to a series of pools.
Then you're close.

855
01:15:28,815 --> 01:15:30,066
You will go.

856
01:15:32,986 --> 01:15:35,279
I was sure it would come to this.

857
01:15:48,877 --> 01:15:53,005
You know that feeling you get sometimes
When you're standing in a high place?

858
01:15:53,173 --> 01:15:55,091
Sudden urge to jump?

859
01:15:57,010 --> 01:15:58,553
I don't have it.

860
01:15:59,972 --> 01:16:01,472
I need those chalices.

861
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:04,100
Shoot. Save me the bother of the fall.

862
01:16:04,268 --> 01:16:07,311
You will go. You will return...

863
01:16:08,647 --> 01:16:10,606
...or I will kill her.

864
01:16:13,443 --> 01:16:14,944
You won't kill your own daughter.

865
01:16:15,112 --> 01:16:17,863
Quartermaster, get me six more pistols,

866
01:16:18,031 --> 01:16:19,615
Remove the shot from all but two,

867
01:16:19,783 --> 01:16:22,243
But do not tell me which two.

868
01:16:24,538 --> 01:16:27,123
You get to choose, mr. Sparrow.

869
01:16:29,918 --> 01:16:34,338
No.

870
01:16:37,467 --> 01:16:40,261
- Yes.
- You're sure?

871
01:16:40,429 --> 01:16:41,846
'Course I am.

872
01:16:50,105 --> 01:16:51,147
Again.

873
01:16:52,691 --> 01:16:55,192
Please, they're not even loaded.

874
01:17:00,073 --> 01:17:01,407
Again.

875
01:17:02,284 --> 01:17:04,160
If you're so keen on killing her,

876
01:17:04,328 --> 01:17:06,704
- Why don't you just let herjump?
- What?

877
01:17:07,497 --> 01:17:09,957
If you jump and die,

878
01:17:10,125 --> 01:17:13,753
Then she will have her chance.

879
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:15,379
Again.

880
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:20,509
Oi...

881
01:17:20,677 --> 01:17:24,513
...if I jump, will I survive?

882
01:17:26,850 --> 01:17:28,184
The doll.

883
01:17:44,534 --> 01:17:49,246
- Yes, now you will survive.
- This is nonsense! I'm going!

884
01:18:08,016 --> 01:18:11,227
Wet. Wet again.

885
01:18:13,563 --> 01:18:16,440
We go on.
Due north to the fountain.

886
01:18:17,275 --> 01:18:18,609
Well played, father.

887
01:18:20,404 --> 01:18:22,697
You knew which guns were loaded, right?

888
01:18:25,450 --> 01:18:27,410
Of course, my love.

889
01:18:37,087 --> 01:18:39,797
Be nice to have a map about now.

890
01:18:39,965 --> 01:18:41,590
Or a ship.

891
01:18:42,342 --> 01:18:46,053
Stop! Hold very still.

892
01:18:47,514 --> 01:18:51,016
Ye dare not let it touch your skin.

893
01:18:59,776 --> 01:19:02,987
What? What be wrong with
An older man having a hobby?

894
01:19:03,155 --> 01:19:05,656
What are you stopping for, eh? Push on!

895
01:19:05,824 --> 01:19:07,992
- Push on!
- You can sleep when you're dead.

896
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:09,326
Push on!

897
01:19:10,954 --> 01:19:14,290
Fortune continues to favor us.

898
01:19:42,068 --> 01:19:44,278
The santiago.

899
01:19:44,446 --> 01:19:47,156
Famously captained by ponce de León.

900
01:19:49,951 --> 01:19:51,368
There's no one there.

901
01:19:51,536 --> 01:19:52,536
Right, then.

902
01:20:27,239 --> 01:20:28,614
We must not stop.

903
01:20:36,665 --> 01:20:38,415
You will walk.

904
01:20:57,602 --> 01:20:59,728
I cannot.

905
01:20:59,896 --> 01:21:01,647
Walk or die.

906
01:21:08,113 --> 01:21:09,321
Put your arms around me.

907
01:21:09,489 --> 01:21:12,867
- I do not ask for help.
- But you need it.

908
01:21:29,801 --> 01:21:34,096
- We're in a hurry, yes?
- Do not fall behind.

909
01:21:53,450 --> 01:21:55,159
Hold here 'til I say!

910
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:10,090
Such beauty.

911
01:22:10,258 --> 01:22:13,552
Surely you're one of
God's own creations,

912
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:16,639
And not a descendant
Of those dark creatures

913
01:22:16,806 --> 01:22:19,058
Who found no refuge on the ark.

914
01:22:21,853 --> 01:22:23,979
Such beauty...

915
01:22:25,273 --> 01:22:26,857
...and yet deadly.

916
01:22:27,859 --> 01:22:31,320
- Deadly? No.
- You attacked me.

917
01:22:31,488 --> 01:22:36,408
No. You are different.

918
01:22:37,369 --> 01:22:38,535
Different?

919
01:22:38,703 --> 01:22:42,706
Are you not? You protect.

920
01:22:46,127 --> 01:22:47,169
Did you...?

921
01:22:48,838 --> 01:22:51,590
You pushed me down out of the way.

922
01:22:52,759 --> 01:22:57,221
- You see the fountain?
- No, but we are close.

923
01:22:57,806 --> 01:22:59,640
Bring the creature.
Cover its head.

924
01:22:59,808 --> 01:23:01,767
She has a name!

925
01:23:06,314 --> 01:23:07,815
Pray tell.

926
01:23:14,072 --> 01:23:15,906
She is Syrena.

927
01:23:56,906 --> 01:23:58,407
Ponce de León.

928
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:05,789
If 40 pirates
Dreamt 40 nights of treasure,

929
01:24:05,957 --> 01:24:09,501
It would not match
The contents of this room.

930
01:24:09,669 --> 01:24:11,211
You.

931
01:24:14,007 --> 01:24:15,799
- You.
- No...

932
01:24:16,968 --> 01:24:19,219
- ...you.
- I was here first.

933
01:24:19,387 --> 01:24:23,390
- You, why are you here?
- Blackbeard sent me.

934
01:24:23,558 --> 01:24:26,018
- Why are you?
- Silver chalices

935
01:24:26,186 --> 01:24:29,521
- For my royal liege.
- Oh, please.

936
01:24:30,815 --> 01:24:32,566
Back, back! We have to balance it out!

937
01:24:34,569 --> 01:24:37,154
The whole ship will slide!

938
01:24:40,950 --> 01:24:42,534
Right, then.

939
01:24:42,702 --> 01:24:48,624
What ifwe each choose an item
Of approximately equal weight?

940
01:24:51,294 --> 01:24:52,711
Put it back!

941
01:24:54,255 --> 01:24:56,298
We touch nothing!

942
01:25:04,224 --> 01:25:05,182
What about that?

943
01:25:05,350 --> 01:25:07,684
The chalices.

944
01:25:09,437 --> 01:25:10,938
Oi! Why do you get to look first?

945
01:25:11,106 --> 01:25:12,773
Fine, then.

946
01:25:32,043 --> 01:25:33,585
- Together.
- Together.

947
01:25:36,339 --> 01:25:37,339
Rocks.

948
01:25:38,424 --> 01:25:39,758
The spanish.

949
01:25:40,510 --> 01:25:42,177
They're ahead of us, mate.

950
01:25:43,096 --> 01:25:46,348
I shall have a look at that map.
If it's what I fear...

951
01:25:56,442 --> 01:25:58,652
I wonder why they left this behind.

952
01:26:01,656 --> 01:26:05,409
Don't touch the map.

953
01:26:10,790 --> 01:26:11,874
They know the path,

954
01:26:12,041 --> 01:26:15,919
But I can also see where
They'll most likely make camp.

955
01:26:29,392 --> 01:26:30,684
Jack!

956
01:26:33,897 --> 01:26:38,025
Gibbs, I was just on me way
To break you out ofjail.

957
01:26:39,986 --> 01:26:41,486
You stole my map.

958
01:26:42,071 --> 01:26:44,489
Right. Best be started.

959
01:26:47,577 --> 01:26:49,077
Olé.

960
01:27:06,471 --> 01:27:07,971
Mermaids.

961
01:27:10,808 --> 01:27:13,727
Careful, these pools run deep.

962
01:27:13,895 --> 01:27:17,439
If she escapes, all is lost.
Quartermaster.

963
01:27:19,108 --> 01:27:22,361
Look. Look!

964
01:27:23,988 --> 01:27:26,907
Staked out to die, to dry in the sun.

965
01:27:27,075 --> 01:27:30,661
Only half in the water.
Not enough to live,

966
01:27:30,828 --> 01:27:34,998
Butjust enough to make the dying slow.

967
01:27:36,209 --> 01:27:37,209
Think on it.

968
01:27:37,377 --> 01:27:40,754
Your people, murdered,
Harvested for their tears.

969
01:27:40,922 --> 01:27:45,217
Syrena, won't you cry?

970
01:27:46,135 --> 01:27:47,928
All die, even you.

971
01:27:48,096 --> 01:27:51,515
- Soon, I hear.
- Listen...

972
01:27:53,601 --> 01:27:55,435
Listen.

973
01:27:55,603 --> 01:27:58,897
Can you not hear your sisters scream?

974
01:27:59,065 --> 01:28:01,483
Do you not hear them?

975
01:28:02,527 --> 01:28:05,320
We need but one tear.

976
01:28:08,199 --> 01:28:09,491
Vile creature!

977
01:28:09,659 --> 01:28:12,202
- Chop off her fingers, one by one!
- Choke her!

978
01:28:12,370 --> 01:28:14,955
Cut out the tears
From behind the eyes!

979
01:28:15,123 --> 01:28:16,415
Where's your voice in this?

980
01:28:17,333 --> 01:28:20,335
Maybe she'll have a change of heart
When the sun rises.

981
01:28:20,503 --> 01:28:24,381
Oh, aye, she will burn,
But I cannot wait for the sun.

982
01:28:24,549 --> 01:28:26,216
Perhaps we should build a fire.

983
01:28:26,384 --> 01:28:28,510
- No.
- Do not contest me, cleric.

984
01:28:28,678 --> 01:28:31,722
- You will not torture her.
- We need only one tear.

985
01:28:31,889 --> 01:28:35,017
I will tear every scale
From her body one by one if I see fit.

986
01:28:35,184 --> 01:28:36,727
If that displeases you, go pray.

987
01:28:36,894 --> 01:28:39,980
I was wrong. Not every soul
Can be saved. Yours cannot.

988
01:28:40,148 --> 01:28:42,983
Behold, gentlemen,
A man formerly of faith.

989
01:28:43,151 --> 01:28:46,028
That vile creature, as you call her,
Is worth a hundred of you.

990
01:28:46,195 --> 01:28:47,904
Oh, you care for her?

991
01:28:49,949 --> 01:28:51,950
You fancy her.

992
01:28:53,661 --> 01:28:56,371
And do not deny what is
Clear to my eyes.

993
01:28:58,207 --> 01:28:59,291
Question is...

994
01:29:02,503 --> 01:29:04,463
...does she fancy you?

995
01:29:06,758 --> 01:29:10,302
By god, she does. We are in luck!

996
01:29:11,763 --> 01:29:13,597
Bring forth a tear...

997
01:29:15,141 --> 01:29:17,642
...or witness the death
Of this poor soul.

998
01:29:19,812 --> 01:29:23,231
Syrena, if you could manage a tear,

999
01:29:23,399 --> 01:29:24,941
I would be grateful.

1000
01:29:26,319 --> 01:29:27,903
Sadness, yes,

1001
01:29:28,071 --> 01:29:33,450
- But no sorrow... Yet.
- Not by your hand, father!

1002
01:29:33,618 --> 01:29:36,244
Time and tide wait for none.
Quartermaster.

1003
01:29:48,591 --> 01:29:52,052
Aye, mermaids are tough.

1004
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:54,221
The lot of them.

1005
01:29:54,389 --> 01:29:58,767
Tie her up like the others.
And get rid of this.

1006
01:30:03,356 --> 01:30:06,316
- You are confident?
- Yes.

1007
01:30:06,484 --> 01:30:09,444
I am a woman. So is she.

1008
01:30:17,495 --> 01:30:20,497
What's your play, Jack?
Throwing in with Barbossa.

1009
01:30:21,582 --> 01:30:23,333
There is a girl...

1010
01:30:23,501 --> 01:30:26,670
...a female... Of the opposite sex.

1011
01:30:26,838 --> 01:30:30,757
- When is there not?
- Perhaps I should say "damsel."

1012
01:30:30,925 --> 01:30:33,927
You're rescuing a damsel?
Well, there's a first.

1013
01:30:34,095 --> 01:30:37,305
Yes, but it's just that
I may have caused said damsel

1014
01:30:37,473 --> 01:30:41,017
- Some manner of harm many moons ago.
- Out with it.

1015
01:30:41,185 --> 01:30:44,479
Gibbs, this is the woman from seville.

1016
01:30:44,647 --> 01:30:48,525
Ah, you pretended to love her,
Then you left her and broke her heart.

1017
01:30:48,693 --> 01:30:53,363
Worse. I may have had,
Briefly, mind you...

1018
01:30:55,575 --> 01:30:58,702
- ...stirrings.
- Stirrings?

1019
01:30:58,870 --> 01:31:02,831
- Stirrings.
- What? Like feelings, you mean?

1020
01:31:02,999 --> 01:31:06,001
No, no, no. Not quite all the way
To feelings. More like...

1021
01:31:10,131 --> 01:31:11,715
All right, feelings, damn you.

1022
01:31:11,883 --> 01:31:16,553
And you left her still.
That's low.

1023
01:31:18,014 --> 01:31:19,222
Thank you.

1024
01:31:26,147 --> 01:31:27,564
Stealth over force.

1025
01:31:27,732 --> 01:31:31,443
I'll take it from here
On account of your condition.

1026
01:31:32,612 --> 01:31:34,446
You don't have termites, do you?

1027
01:31:34,614 --> 01:31:36,573
I appreciate your concern, Jack,

1028
01:31:36,741 --> 01:31:39,242
But i'll be keeping
You company all the same.

1029
01:31:39,410 --> 01:31:42,454
Hold here, lieutenant commander.
Wait for my signal.

1030
01:32:14,445 --> 01:32:16,530
There. That one.
That be the leader.

1031
01:32:16,697 --> 01:32:19,157
Make note of his tent
Because that's where...

1032
01:32:20,660 --> 01:32:24,871
No, wait. By god,
That must be them right there.

1033
01:32:28,417 --> 01:32:30,627
Your sword smells funny.

1034
01:32:30,795 --> 01:32:35,674
Aye. Poison from the
Innards of poisonous toads.

1035
01:32:35,841 --> 01:32:38,927
Just a scratch,
You're a dead man in minutes.

1036
01:32:39,095 --> 01:32:41,388
Would you mind pointing it
The other way?

1037
01:32:41,556 --> 01:32:43,306
I don't like toads.

1038
01:32:48,187 --> 01:32:51,606
- What are you doing?
- Planning an escape route.

1039
01:32:51,774 --> 01:32:55,819
- Isn't that how you do it?
- Yes.

1040
01:32:55,987 --> 01:32:59,072
Or sometimes I just... Improvise.

1041
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:27,559
Now what?

1042
01:33:28,477 --> 01:33:30,979
We stroll out, slow and steady.

1043
01:33:31,147 --> 01:33:32,939
Just like we belong.

1044
01:34:32,416 --> 01:34:36,628
- I'm sorry, Syrena.
- Philip, you're alive.

1045
01:34:36,796 --> 01:34:40,965
- Yes.
- You came for me.

1046
01:34:42,843 --> 01:34:44,344
Why?

1047
01:34:46,472 --> 01:34:48,765
You're different, are you not?

1048
01:34:50,976 --> 01:34:55,313
Do you know not of kindness?
Compassion?

1049
01:35:12,540 --> 01:35:14,499
Tears of sorrow, never.

1050
01:35:14,667 --> 01:35:17,085
Mermaids be too tough for that.

1051
01:35:17,253 --> 01:35:19,379
But tears ofjoy...

1052
01:35:20,923 --> 01:35:23,299
They say these be
The more potent anyway.

1053
01:35:23,467 --> 01:35:26,428
Syrena, on my word,
I had no part in this.

1054
01:35:27,722 --> 01:35:29,139
Let her go.
You don't need her now.

1055
01:35:29,306 --> 01:35:32,225
Let her go? No.

1056
01:35:32,393 --> 01:35:35,353
Secure her bonds.
We leave her with her own.

1057
01:35:44,947 --> 01:35:46,906
How's that escape route working?

1058
01:35:47,074 --> 01:35:49,993
Here's your chance to improvise.

1059
01:35:50,161 --> 01:35:51,453
I'm attempting it.

1060
01:35:51,620 --> 01:35:54,414
I might be able to get a hand loose.

1061
01:35:54,582 --> 01:35:56,833
Oh, you got a knife.
That's very good.

1062
01:35:57,960 --> 01:35:59,461
Better.

1063
01:36:04,925 --> 01:36:06,176
I want one of those.

1064
01:36:10,890 --> 01:36:15,101
Here's to revenge. Sweet and clear.

1065
01:36:15,269 --> 01:36:19,689
- Revenge?
- Come, come, hector.

1066
01:36:19,857 --> 01:36:21,232
If you wanted the chalices,

1067
01:36:21,400 --> 01:36:24,068
You'd seen they were missing and gone.

1068
01:36:24,236 --> 01:36:27,363
You were lying in wait, for Blackbeard.

1069
01:36:29,366 --> 01:36:32,577
King George. Privateer. Wig.

1070
01:36:33,746 --> 01:36:35,163
Cheap theatrical facade.

1071
01:36:35,331 --> 01:36:38,166
- I'm not buying it.
- You weren't there that night.

1072
01:36:38,334 --> 01:36:42,128
- When the pearlwas lost?
- Taken, not lost.

1073
01:36:44,757 --> 01:36:48,885
We were off the coast of hispaniola
When we came under attack.

1074
01:36:49,053 --> 01:36:52,472
No provocation nor warning
Nor offer of parley.

1075
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:55,266
We were peppered with cannon fire.

1076
01:36:56,435 --> 01:36:59,646
And then the sea beneath
The pearl began to roil.

1077
01:37:01,232 --> 01:37:03,608
The pearlwas pitching
And yawing violently.

1078
01:37:03,776 --> 01:37:05,610
Every plank, every rail,

1079
01:37:05,778 --> 01:37:08,613
Every spar, all at once,
Began to creak.

1080
01:37:08,781 --> 01:37:11,783
The rigging had come to life.

1081
01:37:11,951 --> 01:37:14,619
Our own ship turned against us...

1082
01:37:14,787 --> 01:37:18,039
...tangling the crew,
Wrapping around 'em like snakes.

1083
01:37:18,207 --> 01:37:20,583
And wrapping around me leg.

1084
01:37:20,751 --> 01:37:23,127
But me arms were free
And me sword was to hand.

1085
01:37:23,295 --> 01:37:26,798
I am the master of me ship,
Not Blackbeard.

1086
01:37:26,966 --> 01:37:30,426
I am the master of my fate,
Not Blackbeard.

1087
01:37:31,470 --> 01:37:33,805
So I did what needed done.

1088
01:37:40,688 --> 01:37:42,605
I survived.

1089
01:37:44,191 --> 01:37:48,361
So... You're not after the fountain.

1090
01:37:48,529 --> 01:37:52,156
I care not for King George
Or tavern yarns

1091
01:37:52,324 --> 01:37:54,534
That give hope for a healed limb.

1092
01:37:56,203 --> 01:37:59,831
But i'd give my left arm
For a chance at Blackbeard.

1093
01:37:59,999 --> 01:38:03,001
- Not your right?
- I need me good arm

1094
01:38:03,168 --> 01:38:07,797
To drive my poisoned blade
Through his heart.

1095
01:38:08,799 --> 01:38:11,217
I'll see you get the chance, mate.

1096
01:39:30,005 --> 01:39:31,297
The prisoner's escaping.

1097
01:39:38,597 --> 01:39:41,265
He's escaping!
Fan out! Find him!

1098
01:39:41,433 --> 01:39:42,517
Go! Go!

1099
01:39:44,603 --> 01:39:47,438
Hold your fire! I want him alive!

1100
01:39:55,698 --> 01:39:57,615
I figured that was the signal.

1101
01:40:40,743 --> 01:40:44,203
- Go! Prepare to move out!
- The enemy is soon upon us.

1102
01:40:45,956 --> 01:40:48,875
I'm sorry about the chalices, Jack,
But i've an appointment to keep.

1103
01:40:49,043 --> 01:40:52,003
- I'll not be going back.
- No need.

1104
01:40:52,171 --> 01:40:55,173
- Shall we have a drink?
- We'll drink at the fountain.

1105
01:41:13,567 --> 01:41:17,111
How is it we can never meet
Without you pointing something at me?

1106
01:41:18,322 --> 01:41:20,198
You brought the chalices, Sparrow?

1107
01:41:20,365 --> 01:41:22,950
Aye. Oi!

1108
01:41:26,455 --> 01:41:29,540
- I see you brought a friend.
- I did.

1109
01:41:29,708 --> 01:41:32,919
And the one-legged man, he is near.
Aye?

1110
01:41:33,087 --> 01:41:34,462
Aye.

1111
01:41:35,297 --> 01:41:36,297
Now...

1112
01:41:36,465 --> 01:41:39,258
Before I go just handing them over,
I do have one or two conditions.

1113
01:41:39,426 --> 01:41:41,469
- Name them.
- Firstly,

1114
01:41:41,637 --> 01:41:43,971
I'll be having me compass back.
No, no, that's secondly.

1115
01:41:44,139 --> 01:41:46,349
Firstly, upon your word,

1116
01:41:46,517 --> 01:41:48,476
You will bring no harm to Angelica.

1117
01:41:48,644 --> 01:41:50,978
I'll make no vows
To the likes of you, Sparrow.

1118
01:41:51,146 --> 01:41:53,564
But it costs me nothing to admit

1119
01:41:53,732 --> 01:41:56,567
That she was never in harm's way.

1120
01:41:57,236 --> 01:41:59,403
Secondly then, priorly firstly,

1121
01:41:59,571 --> 01:42:01,197
I will be having me compass back.

1122
01:42:02,116 --> 01:42:04,117
Please? I do deserve it.

1123
01:42:04,284 --> 01:42:07,745
Do you have any idea how difficult
It was to catch that filthy pig?

1124
01:42:07,913 --> 01:42:10,248
Not the big one,
The four-legged one.

1125
01:42:13,710 --> 01:42:17,463
Thank you. And thirdly, mr. Beard,

1126
01:42:17,631 --> 01:42:20,299
There are times, not very often,

1127
01:42:20,467 --> 01:42:23,553
When I do reflect
Upon my heinous misdeeds.

1128
01:42:23,720 --> 01:42:27,974
Chief among them, I note how poorly
I have treated mr. Gibbs,

1129
01:42:28,142 --> 01:42:30,768
- My loyal first mate.
- Aye! Now you bring it up...

1130
01:42:30,936 --> 01:42:33,604
Left him to rot in jail, I did.
Didn't care.

1131
01:42:33,772 --> 01:42:38,401
Still don't. But, point being,
You must let him go free.

1132
01:42:40,279 --> 01:42:43,614
- Is that it?
- I think so.

1133
01:42:43,782 --> 01:42:46,367
Quick, or the pig runs,
And good luck getting those chalices.

1134
01:42:46,535 --> 01:42:47,952
Jack, if it's all the same to you,
I'd be just as...

1135
01:42:48,120 --> 01:42:49,412
Done.

1136
01:42:49,580 --> 01:42:50,746
Release the swine.

1137
01:42:56,587 --> 01:42:59,797
Perhaps, if you don't mind,
I could tag along with you folk for a...

1138
01:43:02,593 --> 01:43:04,802
This will lead you to freedom, mate.

1139
01:43:11,518 --> 01:43:14,353
I could have swore it was
Somewhere right around here.

1140
01:44:44,486 --> 01:44:46,821
We must not stop.

1141
01:45:04,172 --> 01:45:05,548
Dead end.

1142
01:45:06,591 --> 01:45:08,509
Dead. End.

1143
01:45:09,219 --> 01:45:10,594
Dead end.

1144
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:14,598
Jack, I'm starting to think
You don't know where you're going.

1145
01:45:15,434 --> 01:45:18,227
It is not the destination
So much as the journey, they say.

1146
01:45:19,479 --> 01:45:20,896
Chalices, if you please.

1147
01:45:32,951 --> 01:45:34,452
Stand back.

1148
01:45:56,850 --> 01:45:58,392
Jack...

1149
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:00,394
...have you ever, in fact...

1150
01:46:00,562 --> 01:46:06,108
...seen with your own eyes...
The fountain of youth?

1151
01:46:06,276 --> 01:46:08,444
I'm sorry, could you
Repeat the question, please?

1152
01:46:08,612 --> 01:46:10,071
Quartermaster.

1153
01:46:11,031 --> 01:46:11,947
No, no!

1154
01:46:15,660 --> 01:46:17,787
Wait, wait! Wait.

1155
01:46:21,083 --> 01:46:25,503
"aqua... De vida."

1156
01:47:04,876 --> 01:47:07,378
Master Scrum...

1157
01:47:07,546 --> 01:47:10,381
- ...do you mind?
- Squire?

1158
01:48:09,107 --> 01:48:11,066
So beautiful.

1159
01:48:50,607 --> 01:48:53,192
Sparrow, i'll be the first
To taste those waters.

1160
01:48:57,697 --> 01:48:59,281
Father.

1161
01:49:02,577 --> 01:49:04,828
The one-legged man.

1162
01:49:07,415 --> 01:49:11,335
- You brought him here.
- Would I do that?

1163
01:49:11,503 --> 01:49:13,587
Edward teach!

1164
01:49:13,755 --> 01:49:17,007
For crimes committed on the high seas,

1165
01:49:17,175 --> 01:49:21,011
By the authority granted me
By his majesty the king...

1166
01:49:21,179 --> 01:49:24,348
...and with a goodly amount
Of personal satisfaction...

1167
01:49:24,516 --> 01:49:27,560
...i hereby place you
In the custody of the court,

1168
01:49:27,727 --> 01:49:31,021
And declare you to be my prisoner.

1169
01:49:32,107 --> 01:49:35,609
My trick's out, is that it?

1170
01:49:35,777 --> 01:49:40,155
Such crimes do include, but are not
Limited to, piracy, treason,

1171
01:49:40,323 --> 01:49:44,451
Murder, torture of
The most heinous sort,

1172
01:49:44,619 --> 01:49:48,497
Including the brutal theft of one used,
Twisted, hairy right leg.

1173
01:49:49,332 --> 01:49:54,003
You... Dare face this sword?

1174
01:49:54,170 --> 01:49:56,589
This far away from your ship? Aye.

1175
01:49:56,756 --> 01:50:01,468
Aye. That be the cold breath
Of fate I feel down my nape.

1176
01:50:01,636 --> 01:50:07,266
But i'll have one last fight, by god.

1177
01:50:07,434 --> 01:50:09,143
Kill 'em all!

1178
01:50:10,812 --> 01:50:12,563
Hang on a minute.

1179
01:50:12,731 --> 01:50:16,609
I just... I just need
To understand something.

1180
01:50:16,776 --> 01:50:20,112
Right, so, you will fight against them,

1181
01:50:20,280 --> 01:50:21,572
They will fight against you.

1182
01:50:21,740 --> 01:50:25,409
All on account of him
Wanting to kill him?

1183
01:50:25,577 --> 01:50:29,496
Where is the sense? Exactly.

1184
01:50:29,664 --> 01:50:33,375
I say, let them fight
Each other while we lay back,

1185
01:50:33,543 --> 01:50:36,962
Watch, have a drink,
Place some wagers!

1186
01:50:38,089 --> 01:50:39,381
Aye.

1187
01:50:41,968 --> 01:50:43,552
- Kill 'em!
- No quarter!

1188
01:51:14,084 --> 01:51:15,709
Get off me!

1189
01:51:48,702 --> 01:51:49,702
Scrum, the chalices!

1190
01:51:51,871 --> 01:51:52,955
And the tear! Follow!

1191
01:51:57,001 --> 01:51:58,168
Fight!

1192
01:51:59,129 --> 01:52:02,631
Hand it over. The tear.
There's a good lad.

1193
01:52:02,799 --> 01:52:05,092
I'm more afraid of her
Than I am of you.

1194
01:52:10,640 --> 01:52:13,016
Hand it over.
There's a good lad.

1195
01:52:16,438 --> 01:52:20,149
- The chalices, if you please.
- Sorry, Jack.

1196
01:52:20,316 --> 01:52:24,528
I told you, I need years.
And now, yours will do.

1197
01:52:32,495 --> 01:52:33,662
Scrum!

1198
01:52:55,351 --> 01:52:56,810
Syrena...

1199
01:53:00,523 --> 01:53:03,317
Oh god, you will not take her.

1200
01:53:03,485 --> 01:53:08,405
If you have taken her,
You will give her back.

1201
01:53:08,573 --> 01:53:10,908
Give her back...

1202
01:53:11,075 --> 01:53:13,911
Give her back, please. Please.

1203
01:53:37,560 --> 01:53:40,270
I expected fate
To put up more of a fight, eh?

1204
01:53:57,163 --> 01:54:00,874
I will not have that smile
On your face as I strike you down.

1205
01:54:02,377 --> 01:54:05,420
Take a gander, edward teach.

1206
01:54:35,994 --> 01:54:39,288
This land is hereby forever
Claimed in the glorious name

1207
01:54:39,455 --> 01:54:41,999
Of his majesty King George...

1208
01:54:48,298 --> 01:54:51,174
Someone make a note
Of that man's bravery.

1209
01:54:58,182 --> 01:55:01,894
Señorita, the chalices, porfavor.

1210
01:55:18,620 --> 01:55:24,249
Only god can grant eternal life,
Not this pagan water.

1211
01:55:35,345 --> 01:55:38,805
Men, destroy this profane temple!

1212
01:55:41,559 --> 01:55:42,851
The fountain!

1213
01:55:56,950 --> 01:55:58,450
You are a fool.

1214
01:55:58,618 --> 01:56:01,870
You seek in this place
What only faith can provide.

1215
01:56:02,038 --> 01:56:04,539
Faith? In faith,
There is light enough to see

1216
01:56:04,707 --> 01:56:06,917
But darkness enough to blind.

1217
01:56:10,546 --> 01:56:12,798
What devilry is this?

1218
01:56:16,803 --> 01:56:19,388
- For the pearl.
- What have you done?

1219
01:56:22,934 --> 01:56:25,310
Angelica! Don't! It's poison!

1220
01:56:29,983 --> 01:56:32,275
I'm not such the fool
To take on Blackbeard

1221
01:56:32,443 --> 01:56:35,821
Without a little venomous advantage.

1222
01:56:37,156 --> 01:56:38,615
Jack!

1223
01:56:50,461 --> 01:56:52,504
I claim Blackbeard's ship and crew,

1224
01:56:52,672 --> 01:56:56,091
And this sword,
Payment for my missing limb!

1225
01:57:10,523 --> 01:57:11,898
Hang on! Pull!

1226
01:57:57,195 --> 01:57:59,529
Do not waste my tear.

1227
01:58:29,018 --> 01:58:31,144
Drink this.
This one has the tear.

1228
01:58:31,312 --> 01:58:33,271
- You must drink the other.
- No!

1229
01:58:34,065 --> 01:58:37,275
I cannot save you both.
One of you must sacrifice.

1230
01:58:38,236 --> 01:58:41,321
You take it, father, for your soul.

1231
01:58:43,366 --> 01:58:48,787
Captain teach, she's dying.
You must save your daughter.

1232
01:58:49,997 --> 01:58:52,749
This one takes life?

1233
01:58:52,917 --> 01:58:54,751
This one has the tear and gives life?

1234
01:58:54,919 --> 01:58:56,169
Aye, hurry!

1235
01:59:05,096 --> 01:59:09,349
Angelica...
Save me, my child.

1236
01:59:11,269 --> 01:59:12,686
No.

1237
01:59:21,404 --> 01:59:22,821
I love you, father.

1238
01:59:35,835 --> 01:59:37,419
Wait a minute.

1239
01:59:39,630 --> 01:59:42,424
In fact, it might have been
The other way around.

1240
01:59:43,301 --> 01:59:47,095
This cup had the tear,
That one had the other bit.

1241
01:59:47,263 --> 01:59:48,471
Trickster!

1242
01:59:48,639 --> 01:59:50,473
- Devil!
- Father!

1243
01:59:57,523 --> 01:59:59,024
You bastard! How could you?

1244
02:00:00,067 --> 02:00:01,484
Your father saved you.

1245
02:00:01,652 --> 02:00:04,154
Perhaps his soul is now redeemed, eh?

1246
02:01:05,007 --> 02:01:07,092
You are hurt.

1247
02:01:09,345 --> 02:01:11,221
In body only.

1248
02:01:12,932 --> 02:01:17,143
My mind is at peace...
Because of you.

1249
02:01:18,229 --> 02:01:21,064
- Me?
- Yes.

1250
02:01:22,108 --> 02:01:24,484
I was lost.

1251
02:01:25,486 --> 02:01:30,115
The wind, the tides...

1252
02:01:30,283 --> 02:01:33,326
...they ought to renew a man's faith.

1253
02:01:34,912 --> 02:01:36,830
But for me, only you.

1254
02:01:37,748 --> 02:01:41,459
Philip, I can save you.

1255
02:01:41,627 --> 02:01:44,546
You need only ask.

1256
02:01:46,048 --> 02:01:50,802
- I seek but one thing.
- What is that?

1257
02:01:51,846 --> 02:01:54,180
Forgiveness.

1258
02:01:54,348 --> 02:01:57,642
If not for me, you would
Never have been captured.

1259
02:01:57,810 --> 02:01:59,436
Ask.

1260
02:02:01,355 --> 02:02:03,148
Forgive me?

1261
02:02:28,299 --> 02:02:29,507
I hate you.

1262
02:02:29,675 --> 02:02:31,968
The bloke who saved your life?

1263
02:02:32,136 --> 02:02:35,305
The years I possess,
Stolen from my own father!

1264
02:02:35,473 --> 02:02:38,475
I only helped Blackbeard do what
Any father should have done.

1265
02:02:38,642 --> 02:02:41,811
You are cruel and ignorant.

1266
02:02:45,566 --> 02:02:49,319
One pistol, one shot.

1267
02:02:49,487 --> 02:02:51,696
To kill myself before I starve?

1268
02:02:51,864 --> 02:02:53,406
There's no trusting you, love.

1269
02:02:53,574 --> 02:02:55,992
Besides, this is a
Well-traveled trade route.

1270
02:02:56,160 --> 02:02:57,744
You can signal a passing ship.

1271
02:02:57,912 --> 02:03:01,331
Or you can just bite the
Proverbial bullet, as it were.

1272
02:03:01,499 --> 02:03:03,083
And how will I get free
Of these bonds?

1273
02:03:03,250 --> 02:03:05,960
You broke free of your bonds
Half an hour ago,

1274
02:03:06,128 --> 02:03:08,922
Waiting for the precise moment
To pounce.

1275
02:03:11,634 --> 02:03:13,301
Admit it, Jack.

1276
02:03:13,469 --> 02:03:17,347
- You still love me.
- If you had a sister and a dog,

1277
02:03:17,515 --> 02:03:19,808
I'd choose the dog.

1278
02:03:19,975 --> 02:03:23,311
Treasure!
There is a chest with jewels!

1279
02:03:23,479 --> 02:03:25,688
Jewels with the power
To rule the wind and tide!

1280
02:03:25,856 --> 02:03:28,942
- You're making that up!
- Wait...

1281
02:03:29,777 --> 02:03:33,446
I am with child. Yours.

1282
02:03:34,698 --> 02:03:36,074
I don't recall that we ever had...

1283
02:03:36,242 --> 02:03:38,952
- You were drunk!
- I've actually never been that drunk.

1284
02:03:39,120 --> 02:03:40,203
Wait!

1285
02:03:42,123 --> 02:03:44,165
There is something I want to say to you.

1286
02:03:44,333 --> 02:03:48,503
Something I wanted to say
From the moment we first met.

1287
02:03:49,463 --> 02:03:50,547
Go on, then.

1288
02:03:52,925 --> 02:03:54,217
I love you.

1289
02:03:57,847 --> 02:03:59,639
As do i.

1290
02:03:59,807 --> 02:04:03,226
Always have. Always will.

1291
02:04:07,773 --> 02:04:09,232
I gotta go.

1292
02:04:09,400 --> 02:04:10,400
Jack!

1293
02:04:12,736 --> 02:04:14,320
This is not over!

1294
02:04:15,406 --> 02:04:16,448
Jack!

1295
02:04:26,041 --> 02:04:27,542
Missed!

1296
02:04:42,850 --> 02:04:45,852
The revenge is mine.

1297
02:04:52,568 --> 02:04:53,985
Sir...

1298
02:04:56,489 --> 02:04:58,323
We found this below decks.

1299
02:05:24,433 --> 02:05:26,684
All hands!
Ply to windward!

1300
02:05:26,852 --> 02:05:30,396
Get cracking,
Ye blooming cockroaches!

1301
02:05:33,108 --> 02:05:35,693
The crown served me well.

1302
02:05:35,861 --> 02:05:38,821
But now, by the gods of sea and sky...

1303
02:05:38,989 --> 02:05:43,076
...make way for tortuga!

1304
02:05:54,213 --> 02:05:57,340
Gibbs, you filthy, besotted shellback,
You made it!

1305
02:05:57,508 --> 02:05:59,050
Aye!

1306
02:05:59,218 --> 02:06:00,718
And I trust we managed a profit

1307
02:06:00,886 --> 02:06:05,098
- From ourjoint enterprise?
- Feast your eyes.

1308
02:06:10,187 --> 02:06:12,689
The compass led me straight and true.

1309
02:06:12,856 --> 02:06:14,816
What of Blackbeard's men
Guarding the ship?

1310
02:06:14,984 --> 02:06:18,820
I employed the selfsame maneuver
We perfected in new guinea.

1311
02:06:18,988 --> 02:06:23,032
Seemed a shame to leave
An entire fleet behind.

1312
02:06:23,200 --> 02:06:25,243
Shame indeed.

1313
02:06:37,214 --> 02:06:38,548
I hate that monkey.

1314
02:06:38,716 --> 02:06:42,135
So, the pearl...
Any idea how to get her out?

1315
02:06:42,303 --> 02:06:45,305
We shall need a crossbow,
An hourglass, three goats.

1316
02:06:45,472 --> 02:06:48,474
One of us must learn to play the trumpet
Whilst the other one goes like this...

1317
02:06:49,018 --> 02:06:52,270
- I know a man with a goat.
- Good. I can go like this.

1318
02:06:54,940 --> 02:06:56,566
Jack, I have to ask...

1319
02:06:56,734 --> 02:06:59,569
You had the chalices,
The water, the tear...

1320
02:06:59,737 --> 02:07:02,238
You could have lived maybe forever.

1321
02:07:02,406 --> 02:07:04,365
The fountain does test you, Gibbs.

1322
02:07:04,533 --> 02:07:07,410
But better to not know
Which moment may be your last.

1323
02:07:07,578 --> 02:07:09,579
Every morsel of your entire being

1324
02:07:09,747 --> 02:07:12,832
Alive to the infinite mystery of it all.

1325
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,501
And who's to say
I won't live forever, eh?

1326
02:07:15,669 --> 02:07:18,755
Discoverer of the fountain of youth.

1327
02:07:18,922 --> 02:07:21,799
I have no say in it, Gibbs.

1328
02:07:21,967 --> 02:07:23,926
It's a pirate's life for me.

1329
02:07:24,887 --> 02:07:26,387
Savvy?
