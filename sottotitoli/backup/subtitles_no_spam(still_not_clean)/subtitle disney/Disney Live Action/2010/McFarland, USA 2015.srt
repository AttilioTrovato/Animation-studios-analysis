1
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,660
He's just sitting there, man.
You can run around the edge!

2
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,860
- I know, right.
- That's what...

3
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,220
All right, guys.

4
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,740
- It wasn't my fault.
- Yeah.

5
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33,841
Hey!

6
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,967
We just set a record.
It's not a good one.

7
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,163
The most points ever scored
against this school, and it's halftime.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,740
You think that's funny, Mitchell?

9
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,860
No, sir.

10
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,122
Well, then why are you laughing?

11
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,300
You're our captain,
elected by these guys.

12
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,420
Our only senior.

13
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,966
The time for you to make an impression
was in practice this week.

14
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,580
On the field tonight. Not now.

15
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,966
And certainly not on the sidelines,

16
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,900
planning a party at your parents' house

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,843
because you know
they're gone this weekend.

18
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,561
Pick it up.

19
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,524
Brandon, come here.

20
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,642
Come here. Yeah, you.

21
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,001
I said pick it up.

22
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,523
Now hand it to him.

23
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,980
Now, we have about five minutes
before we have to go out there,

24
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,208
in front of everybody
who's come here to support us tonight.

25
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,420
The question is,
what's gonna happen to you now,

26
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,500
when you have to go out there,

27
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,011
and everybody thinks
that you're gonna lay down.

28
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,241
Bull...!

29
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,580
Get out.

30
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,205
Me? I didn't say anything.

31
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,487
I said get out.

32
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,401
Are you kidding me?

33
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,526
Come here, let me take a look at that.

34
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,805
Dad, please tell me
that you took the wrong exit.

35
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,850
Are we in Mexico?

36
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,406
No.

37
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,566
Shall we go take a look, folks?

38
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,044
Come on.

39
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,568
Is this really the place?

40
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,881
Wow.

41
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,407
Who's she?

42
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,326
Paint store.

43
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,700
First thing tomorrow.

44
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,643
Assuming there is one.

45
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,220
Julie.

46
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,300
What?

47
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,380
Let's go find your room, girls.

48
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,845
Come on.

49
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,485
This place is a dump.

50
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,500
Like you care.
You'll be at college soon.

51
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,648
I'm the one who's gotta live here.

52
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,820
I think we're all tired, guys.

53
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,020
Why don't we go find
something to eat, okay?

54
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,500
Sounds great.

55
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,204
They gotta have a restaurant, right?

56
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,740
Hi.

57
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,980
Hello. How are you?

58
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,606
Good.

59
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,128
We got tacos, tortas, burritos,
tostadas and quesadillas.

60
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,740
You got burgers?

61
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:21,540
No, we got tacos, tortas, tostadas,
burritos, and quesadillas.

62
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,802
Tacos. We'll take the tacos, thank you.

63
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,325
Okay. What kind of meat do you want?

64
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,280
Asada, al pastor,
chorizo, cabeza, lengua, jamon?

65
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,200
I'll bring you a selection.

66
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,169
You can sit wherever you want.

67
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,445
Here?

68
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,620
I want to watch The Brady Bunch.

69
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,370
Yeah. How about it?

70
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,241
All right, everybody, just stay with me.

71
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,201
- Dad?
- Just...

72
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,300
Come on, man. Don't be scared, mija.

73
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,401
Hey, that's enough.

74
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,607
Hold on.

75
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,361
Dad!

76
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,926
You know what, we're not staying.

77
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,100
First thing Monday morning,
we're out of here.

78
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,780
- Jim.
- No, we're not staying here, all right?

79
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,540
I'm not having you
and the girls stay here.

80
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,660
I'll find something else.

81
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,860
How?

82
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,020
I don't remember there being
a whole lot more options.

83
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,020
We'll move to Bakersfield.
All right? I'll commute.

84
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,600
We cannot afford Bakersfield.

85
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,121
Okay. Look at us.

86
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,300
We're living on a teacher's salary.

87
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,925
If you'd just...

88
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,820
If we had just stayed
somewhere longer, I don't know,

89
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,083
built up some tenure,
then it would be different.

90
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,330
I'm sorry.

91
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,380
Babe, you said it yourself.

92
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,960
This is the only job you could get.

93
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,770
- Yeah.
- Right?

94
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,608
And our girls, they start
that school on Monday.

95
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,128
We just gotta make it work.

96
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,967
We don't have a choice.

97
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,250
Right?

98
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,009
I'm so sorry.

99
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,446
Jamie, hon, you're gonna do it.

100
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,005
Come on, hon.

101
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,740
Please don't make me!

102
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,540
I know. I know it's hard.

103
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,700
Please don't make me!

104
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,485
I know it's hard,
but you gotta do it, okay?

105
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,043
Please, Julie, help me.

106
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,780
Hi.

107
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,087
I'm here to meet with
Principal Camillo. I'm Jim.

108
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,163
Jim, the new life science guy.

109
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,527
And PE coach, and football.

110
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,681
That's right.

111
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,300
Maria Marsol. How was the drive in?

112
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,607
You like living in Bakersfield?

113
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,164
Bakersfield? No. We're...

114
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,761
We're here in McFarland.

115
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,081
Well, look at you.

116
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,331
A little help, please?

117
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,700
Certainly don't want a fire
in this place.

118
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,088
It could cost tens of dollars'
worth of damage, right?

119
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,603
This is your last chance, son.

120
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,924
Make the most of it.

121
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,100
Jim White?

122
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,089
Principal Camillo. How are you?

123
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,420
Decaffeinated. Come on.

124
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,363
I'm supposed to bleed a rock
with the budget,

125
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,460
handle the kids and their petty
vendettas, and quit smoking.

126
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,130
Who am I, Superman?

127
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,601
What happened?

128
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,084
Some kid called his little sister a...

129
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,370
I'm not gonna repeat what he said,

130
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,726
but it explains why she's pregnant.

131
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,929
Sit down. Welcome to McFarland.

132
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,405
You know, I was surprised that a man
like you would want to come here.

133
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,722
But then I read your file.

134
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,971
Up in Saint Paul, you were fired
for verbally abusing your players.

135
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,140
I don't use profanity.

136
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,767
I was just trying to motivate some boys
who didn't know the value of hard work.

137
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,565
And a fight with
the chairman of the school board?

138
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,489
Difference of opinion.

139
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,846
And this latest incident.
You wanna tell me about that?

140
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,562
I lost my temper.
It should never have happened.

141
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,900
What are the chances
of it happening again?

142
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,300
It's not gonna happen again.

143
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,401
Pleased to hear it.

144
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,922
Because you're running
out of options, Mr. White.

145
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,647
Come in, Coach.

146
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,524
Coach White, Coach Jenks.

147
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,060
This is your new
overqualified assistant.

148
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,161
That right?

149
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,921
The name's "White"?

150
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,260
Yep.

151
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,361
Wow.

152
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,370
Berdejo.

153
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,288
Cardenas. Denas?

154
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,451
It's "Cardenas."

155
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,121
Diaz.

156
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,527
Diaz.

157
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,851
Diaz.

158
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,930
It's a popular name
where you guys come from?

159
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,521
We gotta go.

160
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,051
Hold on, class isn't dismissed.

161
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,884
We gotta go, really. It's our mom.

162
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,284
Tell your mother she can wait.

163
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,600
You tell her.

164
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,161
Hey, White.

165
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,485
Is that a popular name
where you come from?

166
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,409
- Mr...
- Puentes.

167
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,800
Victor.

168
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,330
Mr. Puentes, regular PE class.
What do you normally do?

169
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,651
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

170
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,206
Come on, homes.
You really wanna mess this up?

171
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,010
You wanna get this all sweaty?

172
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,005
Real peacock, huh?

173
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,320
All right, I'll tell you
what we're gonna do.

174
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,566
We're gonna...

175
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,529
Let's take a lap, we'll call it a day.

176
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,364
What about you?

177
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,408
I'm not running, jefe.

178
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,608
I'm on the football team.

179
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,364
That's a linebacker's number.

180
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,043
It's not the size of the dog
in the fight, coach.

181
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,844
It's the size of the fight in the dog.

182
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,767
Depends on how big the dog is.

183
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,566
Big dog.

184
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,726
Huddle up! Huddle up!

185
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,970
They aren't really good, are they?

186
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,486
Let's give them a chance, hon.

187
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,820
Maybe Dad will lose it again

188
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,300
and then we'll get
to move somewhere else.

189
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,085
Stop it.
I don't wanna hear another word.

190
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,250
Go, Johnny!

191
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,281
Hut!

192
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,924
Wow.

193
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,820
Nothin'!

194
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,285
Did you see that hit?

195
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,968
All right. Return.

196
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,851
Good job, guys!

197
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,601
Good hit! Good hit!

198
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,684
Nice clean hit.

199
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,443
Johnny. Johnny.

200
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,565
How many fingers am I holding up?

201
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,881
September.

202
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,041
What?

203
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,847
Look, it's Friday, man, okay?

204
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,571
Okay, special teams!

205
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,851
No, no, no, no.

206
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,167
Sit down. No. You're done.

207
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,485
Hey, coach, we only got 10!

208
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,483
We need one more! We need one more!

209
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,961
Sameniego, get in here!

210
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,047
No.

211
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,007
I mean it. Sit down.

212
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,002
Cortez, let's go.

213
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,410
Seriously!

214
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,085
What time is it?

215
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,940
I'm guessing dawn.

216
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,883
- Dad.
- What?

217
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,020
Wring its neck.

218
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,360
Please.

219
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,891
I will.

220
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,443
Welcome to McFarland.

221
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,561
For me?

222
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,160
Thank you.

223
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,124
Well, I see you kept it.

224
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,841
Kept what?

225
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,764
Well, knowing where you live,

226
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,380
and knowing la Señora Soto as I do,

227
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,845
I'm thinking she offered you a chicken.

228
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,442
And since you're in here buying feed
instead of barbeque sauce,

229
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,540
I'm thinking you kept it.

230
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,766
Smart move, hombre.

231
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,100
It shows you got manners.

232
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,361
Thanks, Mr...

233
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,180
Sammy Rosaldo.

234
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,124
Open every day on
Sherwood Avenue since '62.

235
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,641
Jim White.

236
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,740
Cliff Avenue for about a week,

237
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,540
but it sounds
like you already know that.

238
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,290
I know a lot of things about McFarland.

239
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,682
Do you know anything about a plant
that can make my garden look better?

240
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,524
You don't need a plant. You need a tree.

241
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,841
A tree?

242
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,201
Sonia!

243
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,570
The way that lot faces,

244
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,201
the sun's too hot.
Fries up your little verduras.

245
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,086
Lucky for you,
I have a little tree I can sell you.

246
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,730
In 5 years, señor,

247
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,651
you're gonna have a nice yard
with some nice shade.

248
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,160
Five years?

249
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,441
I don't think so.

250
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,420
You know, they got sodas in the store.

251
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,363
Water is free, White.

252
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,010
How long have you guys been at it?

253
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,525
Since five.

254
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,521
Five?

255
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,725
5:00 a.m., White.

256
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,526
"AM" means morning, ese.

257
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,843
Not the radio.

258
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,770
Hey, White. Chop and channel your Jeep,

259
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,247
glass finish it, crank up the bass,

260
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,051
hop up and down... You'll fit right in.

261
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,521
Yeah, when pigs fly. Who's the driver?

262
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,130
That's Javi.

263
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,805
Victor's uncle.

264
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,724
He just got out.

265
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,043
Out? What do you mean "out"?

266
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,561
Out.

267
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,930
Victor polished that rig
every day Javi was inside.

268
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,564
Where's his father?

269
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,050
He's still in there.

270
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,971
See you later, White.

271
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,521
Come in.

272
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,140
Right, I wanna get right to this.

273
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,300
Coach Jenks tells me

274
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,926
that you and he had
an altercation at the game.

275
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,084
- A what?
- An altercation.

276
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,925
Well, I wouldn't...

277
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,446
I wouldn't call it that.

278
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,611
Well, whatever it was,

279
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,140
Coach Jenks doesn't think
this arrangement is gonna work out,

280
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,580
and he's asked for you to step down.

281
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,603
Now, I feel that if he's the coach
of the football team...

282
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,809
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. You...

283
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,940
- You're firing me?
- Nobody said you were fired.

284
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,100
Well, he just asked me to step down,
and you didn't say no,

285
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,500
which in my language
means you're firing me.

286
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,523
- Hold on.
- I just moved my family here.

287
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,681
Hold on, Jim!

288
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,484
I don't have the staff
to go around firing people,

289
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,220
because some insecure jerk
who can't stop eating his apple

290
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,721
got all bent out of shape.

291
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,041
- What did you...
- Shut up!

292
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,726
You had a chance to talk
and you let me do it for you.

293
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,927
You're dismissed.

294
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,740
- Am I fired?
- No, you're not fired either.

295
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,921
Now get out of here.

296
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,860
Look, I don't know
if this is a pattern with you,

297
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,420
and I don't know which one of you
was a bigger jerk out there,

298
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,648
but I'm counting on it
that it wasn't you.

299
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:36,046
Because I need a PE teacher,
and I need a life science teacher.

300
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,721
I don't know how that sits with you,
but that's how it sits.

301
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,365
All right, run a lap.

302
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,521
Go.

303
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,526
Go.

304
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,727
Hi, Jamie.

305
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,887
Hi.

306
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,620
How was school today?

307
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,245
It was okay.

308
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,849
Can I have half of that?

309
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,923
No, but you can have that half.

310
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,361
Yeah, you see that, carnal?

311
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,971
I was down.

312
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,043
How do you like getting smoked?

313
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,126
What now, jefe?

314
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,521
Run another one.

315
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,360
Sure.

316
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,245
Wow. They are fast.

317
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,571
They are.

318
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,801
You want another one?

319
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,260
You know, you're in
the wrong sport, Sameniego.

320
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,647
Not anymore. Coach cut me.

321
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,380
You, too, huh?

322
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,766
Seriously?

323
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,651
You got fired from football?
In your first week?

324
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,649
All right. Don't rub it in.

325
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,250
Congratulations, White.

326
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,127
They're treating you like a picker.

327
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,365
David, Damacio, Danny.
Wake up - it's late.

328
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,847
Your father is waiting in the truck.

329
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,446
Don't be lazy.

330
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,289
The world doesn't wait for you.

331
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,406
May God bless you.

332
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,687
Thank you, Grandma.

333
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,128
David, Damacio - hurry up.

334
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,969
Pay attention and respect your teachers.

335
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,650
See you later.

336
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,201
I hear football didn't work out.

337
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,040
You need something to do
with all of that spare time of yours?

338
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,761
What'd you have in mind?

339
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,041
Migrant parent meetings,

340
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,521
literacy programs, food banks,
support groups.

341
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,260
These families need help.

342
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,361
No, it's not really...

343
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,860
Not really my sort of thing.

344
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,769
You live in McFarland, right?

345
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,723
You ever taken a look out there?

346
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,327
This is one of the poorest
towns in America.

347
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,620
These kids are invisible,
they are expendable.

348
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,940
They come from the fields,
and they go back to the fields

349
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,380
unless the prisons get them first.

350
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,130
You notice we got one right next door?

351
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,324
Yeah, I...

352
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,241
I noticed.

353
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,169
Handy, huh?

354
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,251
Mr. White, it's pretty clear
you don't wanna be here.

355
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,380
But for these kids,
these are the best years of their lives,

356
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,608
and if we're gonna reach them,
now is the time.

357
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,289
But I guess that's not
your kind of thing.

358
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,401
Thanks.

359
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,886
You're welcome.

360
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,766
You know that kid?

361
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,443
Yeah, it's Thomas Valles.

362
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,442
What do you know about him?

363
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,166
Nothing.

364
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,361
You like him.

365
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,681
No, I don't.

366
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,325
She likes him. Get closer.

367
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,642
Dad, don't, please.

368
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,121
- Can I talk to you a minute?
- Yeah.

369
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,486
You mind if I shut the door?

370
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,966
This requires a shut door?

371
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,166
Cross country running.

372
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,846
California is holding their first
state championship this year.

373
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,006
Cross country?
That's a private school sport.

374
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,571
They breathe different air than we do.

375
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,926
No, it's the same air.

376
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,049
You do understand we don't
have a cross country team?

377
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,980
Yeah, what I don't understand
is why we have a football team instead.

378
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,340
I mean, we have kids here

379
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,010
who seem like they can run forever.

380
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,340
They carbo-load on rice and beans.

381
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,140
I mean, they pick in extreme heat,

382
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,820
they go to school all day
and some of 'em even run home.

383
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,900
I've seen it.

384
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,500
- And it's unbelievable.
- Yeah.

385
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,980
And you've just described
half the kids in the Central Valley.

386
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,570
Jim, let me ask you something.

387
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,260
You've coached cross country before?

388
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,340
No.

389
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,260
- Track?
- No.

390
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,681
But you ran?
Competed in high school maybe?

391
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,740
No.

392
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,001
Well, you sound perfect.

393
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,725
Why are you following me?

394
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,440
Do you know how fast you were going?

395
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,370
What are you, a cop?

396
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,087
Look, I don't know
if this car's speedometer is right,

397
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,043
it's an old car, but if it...

398
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,726
If it is, you're running
almost 12 miles an hour.

399
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,724
Means you'd run a mile in five minutes.

400
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,881
So?

401
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,406
You always run that fast?

402
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,045
I don't got a car, all right?

403
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,486
- Can I give you a lift?
- No.

404
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,049
But you can quit following me.

405
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,603
These are the times
from last year's county meet.

406
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,300
And this is
where Thomas would be right now.

407
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,401
Top 10.

408
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,921
Top 10 in the state,

409
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,208
and he doesn't own a pair
of decent running shoes.

410
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,443
Look, Jim, you might be right.

411
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,282
But there's too many issues here,
the school board being one of them.

412
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,220
But if I had board approval,
you'd back it, right?

413
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,846
Well, yeah, sure,
but that's never gonna happen.

414
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,860
California public school system
pre-approved six new sports

415
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,201
a few years ago to
get funding for new lockers,

416
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,647
including guess what?

417
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,125
Cross country.

418
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,288
And a cross country coach.

419
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:26,209
Yeah, it says it right here.
"Cross country coach."

420
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,085
First four runners get one of these...

421
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,761
Nice and cold.

422
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,046
Get on the line.

423
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,081
On your marks...

424
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,527
Get set...

425
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,961
Go!

426
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:09,450
Johnny, stop bothering
those girls and get over here.

427
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,491
Yes.

428
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,000
I wanna ask you a question.

429
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,846
You think the guys in my class
would be into cross country?

430
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,920
Country western ain't my thing, boss.

431
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,604
Cross country running, wise guy.

432
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,820
For what?

433
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,046
To win, to compete.

434
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,140
To impress girls.

435
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,526
Nobody wins around here, White.

436
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,500
Doesn't have to be that way.

437
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,489
I watched you run.
You can beat somebody.

438
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,246
If I felt like it.

439
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,406
Which I don't.

440
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,561
What do you say?

441
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,980
You want to help me get a team together?

442
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,100
How many do we need?

443
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,201
Seven.

444
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,848
You can start with that knucklehead.

445
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:49,960
Johnny, make sure one of
those guys is Thomas Valles.

446
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,481
Hey, ese.

447
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,140
You wanna be on the running team?

448
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,321
Nope.

449
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,606
Come on, man.

450
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,762
Just think about it. Say yes.

451
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,160
Hey!

452
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,420
I wanna talk to you guys
about a running team.

453
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,500
Johnny.

454
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,580
You wanna be on the running team?

455
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,011
I'll be on the running team.

456
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,929
You guys wanna be on the running team?

457
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,820
Hey!

458
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,081
I got you now, Cardenas.

459
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,166
You are this far from juvie, son.

460
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,607
Jose.

461
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,802
You get me my change?

462
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,289
My change got stuck in the machine.

463
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,540
I asked Jose to get it out for me.

464
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,449
You're not helping them, White.

465
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,490
What did you do that for?

466
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,647
Congratulations.

467
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,524
You just made the cross country team.

468
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,980
I told you to stay away from my sister!

469
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,081
Thomas, don't do that!

470
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,247
Tommy, don't do that!

471
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,768
And so did Thomas Valles.

472
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:11,060
Do me a favor, Valles.
Act a little happier.

473
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,289
The coach just negotiated you
out of a suspension.

474
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,361
Danny Diaz?

475
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,001
Hey, we needed seven.

476
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,580
Yeah, seven runners,

477
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,380
not six runners and Danny Diaz.

478
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,700
Hey, Danny's our anchor.

479
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,220
And he'll drag our ass down.

480
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,004
All right, knock it off, Puentes.

481
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,202
Let's see if those legs
work as fast as your mouth.

482
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,004
Elmo Bridge and back. Go.

483
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,641
Go.

484
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,441
Hey.

485
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,170
I mean it, all right?

486
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,521
You're my anchor, Danny,
and not because you're fat.

487
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,167
And you are a little fat, okay?
So you better lose some weight.

488
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,100
So, why am I the anchor?

489
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,940
Because you're gonna
hold this team steady, okay?

490
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,540
I lose you, I'll lose your brothers.

491
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,688
You're important, Diaz.

492
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,171
Let's go.

493
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,561
You hot, homes? You tired?

494
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,700
Because anytime you wanna stop,

495
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,325
we're cool with that.

496
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,920
Now I've seen everything.

497
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,601
You guys keep going.

498
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,808
Down to the bridge and back.

499
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,210
I'll time you from here.

500
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,340
Hey, what are you doing?

501
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,441
You can't quit.

502
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,564
Oh, God.

503
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,924
Thank...

504
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,406
Thank you.

505
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,885
Let's get some water.

506
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,205
Where's Victor?

507
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,645
Anybody seen Danny?

508
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,961
There he is.

509
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,161
Yeah, slower than 911
to a Mexican's house.

510
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,769
Those the best running shoes
you guys got?

511
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,651
Best running shoes,
school shoes, church shoes.

512
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,281
- Good, Danny.
- Good job.

513
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,810
Good job, hermano.

514
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,641
All right.

515
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,161
Put them on.

516
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,961
New shoes.

517
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,327
New shorts, man!

518
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,881
Ain't no way I'm wearing these.

519
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:21,060
Yeah, well, then you're running naked,
because those are our uniforms.

520
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,162
Hey, we wear them, you wear them, ese.

521
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,700
All right, let's hurry up.

522
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,768
Don't forget
to take the tags off, right.

523
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,042
- Coach Jameson?
- Yes, sir?

524
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,810
Jim White, McFarland.

525
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,521
I didn't know McFarland had a team.

526
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,169
Is that them?

527
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,690
Yeah. Yeah.
They're faster than they look.

528
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,681
If you say so.

529
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,009
See you on the course.

530
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,245
Okay, guys.

531
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,250
Okay, here we go.

532
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,300
Remember, scoring is based on
your individual places, all right?

533
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,540
You finish first, that's a 1.

534
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,802
Second, that's a 2, and so on.

535
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:19,130
The team with the lowest combined score
for their top 5 runners wins.

536
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,646
So the lowest score wins?

537
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,442
That's right, it's like golf.

538
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,611
You think we play golf?

539
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,366
We don't got a country club.
We don't even got a Kmart.

540
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,564
I bet that guy plays golf.

541
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,161
Hold on.

542
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,482
If my score don't count,
why am I even here?

543
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,880
To make us look faster, panzón.

544
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,166
All right, look.

545
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,810
Just try and remember,
lowest score wins.

546
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,940
If you get ahead of
any of their top five guys,

547
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,180
that adds points to their total.

548
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,123
Even you, Danny. Got it?

549
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,445
Doesn't matter.

550
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,050
Let's go show them how it's done.

551
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,529
Come on, Danny!

552
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,841
Where the hell is McFarland?

553
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,603
I hear they can't run
without a cop behind them.

554
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,162
Or a Taco Bell in front of them.

555
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,681
Timers ready?

556
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,003
Runners, take your mark...

557
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,530
Come on.

558
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,691
5: 17. Good pace, Hunter.

559
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,140
5:22, Thomas! Keep that pace!

560
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,810
Come on! Come on! Get it. Get it.

561
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,300
You got him! Come on!

562
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,460
Stay with him! Stay with him!

563
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,140
That's it! That's it!
You're looking great!

564
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,368
Good pace, Robby!
Keep the pace. Keep that up!

565
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,520
Come on. Pick it up.

566
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,808
Go! Go! Go!

567
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,566
Jose, good!

568
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,571
Good, David, good!

569
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,126
Come on, Danny!

570
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,971
That's a boy, Hunter!
Take him, take him!

571
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,220
Come on, kid!

572
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,620
Come on, Hunter.

573
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,060
- Come on!
- Come on.

574
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,446
Power it up!

575
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,140
Come on.

576
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,765
Stay steady. Stay steady.

577
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,260
You got him, Hunter!

578
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,940
Come on! Move it, move it!

579
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,485
You got him! Way to go!

580
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,170
Atta boy! Atta boy!

581
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,890
That's right, bring it home, baby!
Bring it home.

582
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,045
- Nice.
- Come on, buddy.

583
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,420
Come on, come on.

584
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,900
Get up! Let's go.

585
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,980
Blue jersey is right on to you.
Keep that spot.

586
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,081
Kick it!

587
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,340
You can get him! You can get him!

588
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,646
You can get him!

589
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,646
- Keep it!
- Hold that position!

590
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,700
Yes!

591
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,961
Good, Thomas. Good.

592
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,003
Good job, guys! Good job!

593
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,260
Centennial, Centennial,

594
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,805
Palo Alto and Morro Bay.

595
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,445
Finish strong!

596
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,100
Palo Alto, McFarland.

597
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,645
Morro Bay, McFarland.

598
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:11,940
All the way.

599
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,168
McFarland. McFarland.

600
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,083
Good, Danny, you never stopped.

601
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,361
You never stopped.

602
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,250
And McFarland.

603
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:34,489
Coming in with a combined score of 35,

604
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,483
the winner is...

605
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,165
Centennial.

606
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,420
Second, Palo Alto, 41.

607
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,500
- Nice!
- Right here!

608
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:47,260
Third, Morro Bay, 61.

609
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,820
Good job. Yeah.

610
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,524
And in fourth place

611
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,049
with a score of

612
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,361
104...

613
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,446
McFarland.

614
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,540
That's a great race, boys.

615
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,529
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it's great guys.

616
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,843
So I guess, better luck next time, boys?

617
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,445
Right? Yeah?

618
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,001
Seriously. Later.

619
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,768
What happened out there today
was not your fault, you hear me?

620
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,686
It was my fault.

621
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,409
I should have checked the course.

622
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,220
That final hill,
I should have known about that.

623
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,049
Thomas would have
eaten that kid's lunch.

624
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,727
What happened out there today
is on me, understood?

625
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,041
Understood?

626
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,362
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

627
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,761
Yeah.

628
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,081
Good.

629
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,241
Hello, son.

630
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,086
Say hello to your father.

631
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,260
But fourth place, in your first meet.

632
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,220
That's not too shabby.

633
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,606
Fourth out of four.

634
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,409
Also known as last.

635
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,528
Last doesn't get us out of here.

636
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,122
Last doesn't get me a job
somewhere else.

637
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,204
I'm way too soft on these kids.

638
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,460
Hey.

639
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,767
It's Julie's birthday
tomorrow, remember?

640
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,645
Could you please stop by the store
and pick up her cake on the way home?

641
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:53,726
Sure.

642
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,322
I got her a really fancy one.
It's beautiful.

643
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,167
Jim?

644
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,620
Birthday dinner is at 6:00, okay?

645
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,801
Okay.

646
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,601
Okay, I hear you.

647
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:10,966
Okay.

648
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,888
We don't have a hill.

649
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,526
These are our hills.
This is where we're gonna run.

650
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,560
All of them?

651
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,051
That's right.

652
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,043
What happened to us in Palo Alto,

653
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,611
never gonna happen again.

654
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,290
Let's go.

655
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,851
Let's go!

656
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,446
We're done.

657
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,405
Who's done?

658
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,010
We are.

659
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,860
You mean you want to quit?

660
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,167
Go home, stretch out on the couch?

661
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:20,900
Guess what? Me, too.

662
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,500
But it ain't gonna happen.

663
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,220
Here's what we're gonna do.

664
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,260
We're gonna catch our breath,

665
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:28,169
and then we're gonna hit it again.

666
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:31,370
Danny's about to collapse.

667
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:33,380
It's hard.

668
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,289
- It's hard?
- Yeah.

669
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,100
I'll tell you what's hard,

670
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,140
is watching someone pass you
on that last hill.

671
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:40,287
Just ask Thomas.

672
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:44,329
What's hard is losing when you know
you haven't done enough.

673
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:48,326
All right, we're going to get to the point
where when we see a hill, we smile.

674
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,244
The higher, the better.

675
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,243
All right. Now we know
what we didn't know, right?

676
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,580
Right? Now we know what we didn't know.

677
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:56,727
Today's the beginning.

678
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,490
Let's hit it again.

679
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,246
Let's hit it again.

680
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,804
Come on, guys.

681
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,128
What are you waiting for, Valles?

682
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,281
Who's got one more?

683
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:35,966
Come on, lean into this.

684
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,561
Good.

685
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:39,931
Good.

686
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,084
Come on. Let your arms
take you up that hill.

687
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,740
Change the gear when you go uphill.

688
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,683
You gotta change it.

689
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,123
Change the gear going up that hill!

690
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:53,690
Come on, Danny, start to give it to me!

691
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:00,691
If we don't back down
they won't, either.

692
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:06,046
Come on, Diaz, they're lapping you.

693
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:10,810
Pick it up, Danny. All right?

694
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,167
You're the anchor. You're not the brake.

695
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:14,801
Atta boy.

696
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,321
Good, Jose.

697
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:18,970
You think I'm picking on you, Diaz?

698
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:21,361
Go faster, I'll pick on somebody else.

699
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,642
Good! Good!

700
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,366
That's it. Take a break.

701
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,330
Okay, good.

702
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:32,811
Good.

703
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,780
Okay, that's what I wanted to see.

704
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,370
That's how we need to finish.

705
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,522
Good job. Take a break.

706
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:45,727
Valles!

707
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,330
Valles, I said take a break.

708
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:49,766
How many more do you want?

709
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,445
10, 20, 100?

710
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:52,641
Take a break!

711
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,380
You think you're tough, White?
Well, we're tougher, right.

712
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,140
We're not runners. We're pickers.

713
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:00,740
And we're always gonna be pickers.

714
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:02,729
And every day we're gonna get up
and do the same thing

715
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,524
over and over again, just like this.

716
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:07,900
So you can make us do it
a hundred times, a thousand times,

717
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,700
because guess what?

718
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,564
It's never gonna change, all right?

719
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:24,407
You know what these are, White?

720
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,660
You know what's under here?

721
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,762
Almond hulls. You eat almonds?

722
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,124
You like them?

723
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,288
They come out
the packet real nice, right?

724
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:39,771
Well, somebody picked those, White.

725
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,201
But you can use them
for hill training, right?

726
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:50,806
Valles.

727
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,202
Suspend me if you want, man.

728
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:56,045
I'm done.

729
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:04,763
Okay, practice is over.

730
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,780
Are you going to leave again?

731
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:18,927
This is your fault.

732
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:21,771
Everything is always my fault.

733
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:23,326
Be quiet.

734
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:25,325
You've abandoned us.

735
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:27,041
Be quiet!

736
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:07,680
Where's the cake?

737
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:14,890
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

738
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:19,888
I'm sorry I was late.

739
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,289
You forgot it, didn't you?

740
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:25,800
That's okay.
I didn't really want it anyway.

741
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,004
This was really important to her, Jim.

742
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:39,206
I'm sorry, all right?
I'm sorry, but my...

743
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:42,242
My best runner just quit.

744
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,260
No, check that. I mean, I... I mean...

745
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:48,340
He didn't just quit.
He had some kind of breakdown.

746
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:50,860
I don't care. Julie is 15 years old,

747
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:53,247
and you couldn't even remember her cake.

748
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:57,600
Well, if a missed cake's the worst thing
that ever happens to her,

749
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:58,940
she's got it over most of these kids.

750
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,486
You know what? She's your daughter, Jim.

751
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,660
And if you think any one
of those fathers out there

752
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,100
would miss their daughter's birthday,

753
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,885
then you oughta go out and see
what kind of cakes they get them.

754
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,247
Julie?

755
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,410
Julie, please let me in.

756
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:29,565
Go away, Dad.

757
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,001
Thomas?

758
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,365
What are you doing
on the bridge, Thomas?

759
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,125
I don't know.

760
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:57,927
Who hit you?

761
00:51:58,040 --> 00:51:59,769
No one.

762
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:07,211
All right, my dad.
But it wasn't his fault.

763
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,568
I don't know about that.

764
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,860
Yeah, well, you don't know
about a lot of things. Okay, White?

765
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:15,940
You haven't got a clue.

766
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:17,326
All right, then...

767
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:20,567
Then explain it to me.
Help me figure it out.

768
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,740
Look, he's a picker.

769
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,660
He's not a foreman like Señor Diaz.

770
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,000
He doesn't run a crew.

771
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:31,891
He just tries to get
whatever work he can find,

772
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:34,162
Arizona, Texas, wherever.

773
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,490
And he got back yesterday
and his baby girl is pregnant.

774
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:43,811
And so he just started
hitting the wall, all right?

775
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:48,090
And I was trying to get him to stop,
and I just got in the way.

776
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:54,460
Look, if he hurts his hands,
he can't work.

777
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:55,607
Do you get that?

778
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:57,161
Okay.

779
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,843
Okay, Thomas, I get it.

780
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,962
Do you want to know why I'm out here,

781
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:16,085
middle of night,
driving around by myself?

782
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:18,645
No.

783
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:20,610
Too bad. I'm gonna tell you anyway.

784
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,691
I forgot to buy
my daughter's birthday cake.

785
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:30,964
That's bad, White.

786
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:35,924
Look, you...

787
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:40,245
You scared me today. You did.
And you're...

788
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:44,010
You're scaring me now,
so you wanna come off of there?

789
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:46,561
No.

790
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,380
Okay, then let me tell you the truth

791
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,608
about what happens,
how this ends, if you...

792
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:57,569
If you fall from here.

793
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:02,970
If you go off this bridge tonight,
and there's every chance you might,

794
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,844
you'll probably live, all right?

795
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:09,723
It's not that high,
but I promise you, Thomas,

796
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:12,969
there's no chance you'll ever run again.

797
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,565
None.

798
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:20,524
And right now I'm guessing
running's the best thing you've got.

799
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,580
Feels as if it might be
the only thing you've got.

800
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:26,841
Come on down.

801
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,325
Okay?

802
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:53,210
So you wanna...

803
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:57,126
You wanna keep going
with this cross country thing?

804
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:05,329
Me, too.

805
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:08,568
Me, too.

806
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:48,286
You shorten your stride,

807
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:51,451
lean into the hill, and lower your head.

808
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,765
This is the only place
you'll ever do this in cross country.

809
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:03,961
Julie?

810
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:11,124
Nobody can hold a grudge
like a teenage girl.

811
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:12,567
How about her mom?

812
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:15,165
I'm working on it.

813
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:22,285
Don't even think about it.

814
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:50,220
All right, I'm not the ice cream man.

815
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:51,300
Six miles.

816
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:53,846
Same pace, all right?
Gotta lay down our base.

817
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:55,441
Johnny.

818
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:57,660
Johnny, why are your arms
flying around everywhere?

819
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,125
I don't know.
Why you riding a Barbie bike?

820
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:01,005
Because it's pretty?

821
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,250
I bet you got
the matching doll house, too, huh?

822
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:06,128
Which one are you, White? Blanco Barbie?

823
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:08,420
All right, joke less, run more.

824
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:09,500
Everybody tuck your arms in.

825
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:10,931
You're all starting to look
like the mangy chicken

826
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:13,805
I got hanging around my house.

827
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:15,610
You're not smiling, are you, Valles?

828
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:16,887
No.

829
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,326
No, I didn't think so.

830
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:31,482
Be warm and loose
for the start of the race.

831
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:36,326
That's right, fellas.
Stay nice and relaxed.

832
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:40,446
Nice work.

833
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:42,085
Okay. Come on.

834
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:43,967
Come on.

835
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:48,326
Everybody all right?

836
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:50,921
This is a dual meet,
just us and them, all right?

837
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:53,686
Clovis versus McFarland. They're good,

838
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:55,205
they're ranked,

839
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,365
and they think we're pushovers.

840
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:00,046
You ready?

841
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:03,326
Let's do it, Blanco.

842
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:04,561
All right.

843
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:10,201
Where are we from?

844
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:12,089
- Uno, dos, tres...
- McFarland!

845
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,087
All D block...

846
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:29,089
All D block inmates, 15 minutes.

847
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:02,128
Can they even understand you?

848
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:07,569
You probably just point, huh?
"Go that way, amigo."

849
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,082
Yeah, something like that.

850
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:15,723
15:40, Derek!

851
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:17,723
Just cruise to win.

852
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,882
15:45, Thomas!

853
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:23,567
Now, go get him.

854
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:27,287
Go get him.

855
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:30,121
Atta boy.

856
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:39,726
Atta boy.

857
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:42,241
Come on, Thomas.

858
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:54,371
16:30, Thomas. Good job.

859
00:59:58,680 --> 00:59:59,966
Atta boy, Johnny.

860
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:03,085
Jose, good.

861
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:06,921
Come on, Danny.

862
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:09,088
- Come on, Sean.
- Come on, Danny!

863
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:28,570
That's what I have.

864
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:42,322
Well, it was close, boys.

865
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:44,606
Like I said...

866
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:48,930
They're a great team.

867
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:52,446
But you're better.

868
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:56,249
Clovis scored 28.

869
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:57,860
McFarland, 27.

870
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:58,940
Hang on. You mean...

871
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:01,168
That's right. Lowest score wins.

872
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:04,123
You just won your first race.

873
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:14,841
Good race, amigo.

874
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:22,841
I told you we were gonna win.

875
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:42,801
Car trouble, honey?

876
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:45,883
Come on in, baby,
we'll get you fixed up.

877
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:47,970
Come on in.

878
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:58,090
Where are the Diazes?

879
01:01:58,800 --> 01:01:59,847
Out.

880
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,020
"Out"? What do you mean "out"?

881
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:02,531
Out like off the team.

882
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:04,241
What?

883
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:06,685
- Says who?
- Says their father

884
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:08,205
who's also their foreman.

885
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,525
My boyfriend's got a garage in the back.

886
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:13,883
He'll take a look
at that little car of yours.

887
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:15,060
Thank you.

888
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:16,491
There you go.

889
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:18,569
Oh, my goodness, honey.

890
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:21,849
What have you been
doing with these hands?

891
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:25,891
Moving houses, I guess,
trying to make a garden.

892
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:29,644
Just sit back, enjoy the view,

893
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,129
and we will get you out of here
in no time.

894
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:35,406
That's my boyfriend.

895
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:38,610
He's handsome, isn't he?

896
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:41,001
I know.

897
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:51,380
Hey, Damacio.

898
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:53,220
Look, you wouldn't understand.

899
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:54,560
Damacio...

900
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:00,420
This was our teacher
for running, Mr. White.

901
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:02,329
He just stopped by real quick to say hi.

902
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:07,725
You wanna eat?

903
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:10,762
Hope you like enchiladas, White.

904
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:25,926
Ready to try it?

905
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:36,809
A little bit.

906
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:02,851
How many is that? Seven? Eight?

907
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:04,801
Saying no is rude.

908
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:07,361
Yeah, so is puking on the table.

909
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:11,683
Take home to the family.

910
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:14,688
No, no, señora, please.

911
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:16,900
- Gracias, but I couldn't.
- No.

912
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,820
Don't say to me no, okay?

913
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:21,060
My husband always working,

914
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:23,900
but every day he's sitting
at the table with his family.

915
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,764
He's talking and he's listening.

916
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:28,042
How you gonna be family
if you no eating together, huh?

917
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:30,365
I want that back.

918
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:39,285
Can I give you a hand with those tubs?

919
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:43,165
Just saying...

920
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:44,924
Can I help you out?

921
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:47,000
No, gracias.

922
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:48,847
David...

923
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:51,420
I'd like you to ask your father
something for me.

924
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:52,601
Yeah.

925
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:59,323
You know what? Just tell him...

926
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:02,580
Just tell him it was an honor
to be invited into his home.

927
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:05,286
Dad, he said it was an honor
to be invited into your home.

928
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:07,890
Tell him I say thanks.

929
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:14,731
I'm sorry, I thought you...

930
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:16,410
I get by.

931
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:23,242
Thank you for your hospitality.

932
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:27,960
We don't ask for help around here.

933
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:31,940
You want to help me wash my buckets?

934
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:34,486
You want to be
a helpful person, that's okay.

935
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:37,460
But I know why you're here.

936
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:39,688
You want my sons to run a race.

937
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:42,540
Mr. White,

938
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:46,247
your sport is like a TV.
It's not essential.

939
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:48,900
Each hour that my boys train with you

940
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,207
is one hour they do not work with me.

941
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:53,241
That's food off our table.

942
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:57,051
I don't expect a man like you
to understand.

943
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:23,205
Blanco?

944
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:25,761
What are you doing here?

945
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:27,006
You know you're white, right?

946
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:35,740
You sure about this?

947
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:38,923
Yeah, don't white people
mow their lawns on Saturday?

948
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:41,004
I haven't got a lawn.

949
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:42,845
What are we doing?

950
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:44,844
You're not gonna like it.

951
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:48,486
Blanco?

952
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:51,489
Now you just gotta lean it over

953
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,240
and cut.

954
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:56,171
Take off the outer leaves
and turn it over.

955
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:59,180
This will be your row, okay?

956
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:01,248
Keep your knees bent
or it'll hurt your back.

957
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:05,324
You okay, Blanco?

958
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:10,531
You guys do this all day?

959
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:12,087
Yeah.

960
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:15,084
Get this field done,
maybe start on another one.

961
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:18,885
You get paid by the hour?

962
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:21,520
Not by the hour, by the field.

963
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:25,484
The faster we get this one done,
the more our father makes.

964
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:27,641
By the field?

965
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:38,370
Hey, Damacio, how old were
you guys when you started

966
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:39,567
working for your dad?

967
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:41,765
10? 11?

968
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:44,321
Is that even legal?

969
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:47,806
Strawberries, it is. And potatoes.

970
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:49,487
Other crops, you gotta be 12.

971
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:51,540
I remember, first day I started,

972
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:54,120
I wanted to quit after the first hour
because it was so hard.

973
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:55,646
Cried like a baby.

974
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:58,087
Yeah, I know how you feel.

975
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:01,723
You wanna quit, Blanco?

976
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:04,841
What do you think?

977
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:53,725
Blanco?

978
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:56,020
I'm sorry, it's my back.

979
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:57,884
I know, I know. Just lie down.

980
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:00,481
Face down. Come on.

981
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:05,368
Yeah. It's okay.

982
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:10,641
It's okay.

983
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:13,660
You just gotta do this
every few hours when you first start.

984
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:15,205
Your body's not used to it.

985
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:45,007
Okay, listen, guys. I get it.

986
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:48,008
Your father needs you.
All right, so this is...

987
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:51,620
Thank you. This is what we do.

988
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:55,088
On days you have to pick late,
we practice later.

989
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:58,411
All right? And the days we have meets,
you pick extra early

990
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:00,688
and you still make your dad's quota.

991
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,604
I'll pick with you if I have to.

992
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:05,445
Only if you have to though,
right, Coach?

993
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:07,841
Because you don't
look too good right now.

994
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:11,964
"Coach"? You sure about that?

995
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:14,282
Not "Blanco"? Not "White"?

996
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:15,606
Not "homes"?

997
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:19,201
No. Coach.

998
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:22,090
Coach. Good.

999
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,540
What are you eating there?

1000
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:25,660
Tacos. You want one?

1001
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:27,125
No, give me two.

1002
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:31,326
I'm just saving you, Danny.

1003
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:11,380
Can you pass me another one, sweetheart?

1004
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:12,527
Yep.

1005
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:17,205
Got it, got it.

1006
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:21,921
What's going on?

1007
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:23,100
Tamale sale.

1008
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:24,580
- And car wash.
- Team fundraiser.

1009
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:25,727
This afternoon.

1010
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:29,300
- Can you help me with this, babe?
- Yeah.

1011
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:31,926
My boys running for you,
they need new uniforms,

1012
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:33,980
and better shoes.
Why you buy them the cheap shoes?

1013
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:35,161
You're not proud of them?

1014
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:39,042
You are a good man and so I helping you.

1015
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:41,204
Okay, now go shower.

1016
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:47,606
Chicken, chicken, chicken, chicken!

1017
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:51,820
And how many tickets
did you say your mama sold?

1018
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:54,321
You better hope
only half of them show up.

1019
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:08,368
Well, let's get our buckets, guys.

1020
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,660
- Hey, Cheryl! Hi, honey.
- Lupe!

1021
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:32,820
How you been?

1022
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:35,048
I'm so good. How are you?

1023
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:36,580
Do you remember my boyfriend, Javi?

1024
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:38,820
- Yes. Javi, how are you?
- Hey, good to see you.

1025
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:40,729
This is my husband, Jim.

1026
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:43,167
- What's up? Javier. Javi.
- Hello.

1027
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:47,403
Yeah, my sister's boy
is on your team. Victor.

1028
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:50,291
You know, Javi,
I think I owe you an apology.

1029
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:54,525
That first night we were here,
on that Friday night, I saw you...

1030
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:56,722
And your cars and I thought you were...

1031
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:58,325
Gangbangers?

1032
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:03,100
Maybe once upon a time, homes.

1033
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:04,850
We're just a car club, man.

1034
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:08,050
Look at these cars, man.
They're our babies.

1035
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:09,844
We wouldn't wanna put them in danger.

1036
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,365
Plus, man...

1037
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:12,620
If we commit a crime,
what's the first thing

1038
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:14,100
the witness is gonna notice?

1039
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:15,440
The paint job.

1040
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:18,930
Hey, Victor.

1041
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:21,100
You're gonna mess up
the paint job, homes.

1042
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:23,248
Hey, don't scratch my face, ese.

1043
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:24,965
Look, look.

1044
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:27,122
Lupe! Beautiful!

1045
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:29,860
Jim, you gotta see this.
You've got to see this.

1046
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:32,122
- Come on, come on.
- Check it out.

1047
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:34,844
Do you like it?

1048
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:39,006
Yes.

1049
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:41,928
He appreciates me.

1050
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:46,300
Oh, boy.

1051
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:48,687
I wish you appreciated me
more like that.

1052
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:08,571
What you got your nose in, Coach?

1053
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:12,366
"The McFarland Cougars
are making an impression.

1054
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:14,860
"It started with a stunning upset,
beating Clovis High,

1055
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:18,060
"but then consecutive victories
over Yosemite and Morro Bay

1056
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:21,620
"left the racing community
and everyone else asking the question,

1057
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:24,405
"'Just where did these
McFarland runners come from?'"

1058
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:27,364
Some good news for a change.

1059
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:28,766
You said it.

1060
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:33,607
Jim, you have a minute?

1061
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:36,731
Listen to this. It's from Jose Cardenas.

1062
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:39,940
"We fly like blackbirds
through the orange groves,

1063
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:41,780
"floating on a warm wind.

1064
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:44,500
"When we run, we own the earth.

1065
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:48,082
"The land is ours.
We speak the birds' language.

1066
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:50,723
"Not immigrants no more.

1067
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:53,803
"Not stupid Mexicans.

1068
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:56,780
"When we run, our spirits fly.

1069
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:59,008
"We speak to the gods.

1070
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:01,482
"When we run, we are the gods."

1071
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:07,489
It's good work, White.

1072
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:12,845
Yeah. Jose is a good kid.

1073
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:16,722
I don't mean Jose.

1074
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:20,648
Welcome to McFarland, Blanco.

1075
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:54,642
You know the way I used to coach,

1076
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:58,920
I'd take soft kids and kick their butts
till they toughened up.

1077
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:02,566
You think that's funny?

1078
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:04,580
You beating up some white kids, White?

1079
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:05,920
I think that's funny.

1080
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:09,604
You know, I don't know if you know,

1081
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:12,761
but if we keep going
the way we're going,

1082
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:15,609
you guys have a chance
to qualify for State.

1083
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:17,806
Really?

1084
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:19,200
Yeah, really.

1085
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:22,204
But it doesn't matter what I think, okay?
I can't do it for you.

1086
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:25,980
And I don't have to be the one to tell you
that the odds are stacked against you.

1087
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:27,411
But if you...

1088
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:30,020
If you believe in yourselves
and maybe more importantly,

1089
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:34,500
you find a way to believe
in each other, in your teammates,

1090
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:36,090
it won't matter what anyone else thinks.

1091
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:40,484
That's the beauty of sports.

1092
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:41,721
We don't practice to lose, homes.

1093
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:44,046
I mean, Coach.

1094
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:53,300
You don't eat the produce, Coach.

1095
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:54,526
What?

1096
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:56,250
You don't eat the produce.

1097
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:59,126
First rule of picking,
you eat it, you're fired.

1098
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:05,881
God, I'm sorry, guys. I didn't...

1099
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:13,564
All of you, dead.

1100
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:20,840
Come on, White!

1101
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:26,209
When we...

1102
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:29,331
When we qualify, your world can
start to look very different.

1103
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:31,443
Coach, don't you mean "if'?

1104
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:33,602
No, I mean "when."

1105
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:35,300
All right, so start thinking
about what college

1106
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:36,606
you're gonna apply to.

1107
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:38,086
Cal Poly's got...

1108
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:41,045
Agriculture, crop science,

1109
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:42,561
viticulture.

1110
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:46,769
I wouldn't be surprised if you kids
knew half that stuff already.

1111
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:48,487
Think about it, guys.

1112
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:51,300
Cal Poly's only
a few hours from here. All right.

1113
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:54,406
You can still help your parents out
on the weekend, but if you get a degree...

1114
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:56,780
You get a degree,

1115
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:58,848
and you have to read it
to get a degree...

1116
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:00,660
You're gonna be able to
help them out a lot more

1117
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:03,570
than the money you make
out in the fields. All right?

1118
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:05,446
Right?

1119
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:15,162
Things are going really well for me.
Coach thinks we can make it to finals.

1120
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:17,770
Maybe...

1121
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:20,330
I can get into college.

1122
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:22,601
College?

1123
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:28,404
You know what...

1124
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:32,120
Take your face out of those books.

1125
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:35,606
They're going to ruin your eyes.

1126
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:47,486
Nobody ever needed a book in the fields.

1127
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:48,363
How big?

1128
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:53,683
I told you 20 times, Danny, very.
All right?

1129
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:57,203
Don't worry. That's why we trained.

1130
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:01,569
I know, but how big?

1131
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,604
That big.

1132
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:13,241
Take a good look, guys,

1133
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:16,601
because this is
where we qualify for State.

1134
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:20,244
All we gotta do is be in the top four.

1135
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:21,447
That's it.

1136
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:31,921
Hey.

1137
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:34,241
Congratulations.

1138
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:36,931
Team to watch.

1139
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:38,140
Thanks.

1140
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:40,402
And coach to watch.

1141
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:44,641
Palo Alto's got its eye on you.

1142
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:49,340
There could be something coming up,
if you're interested.

1143
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:51,442
Coaches, you have three minutes.

1144
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:56,409
Thanks. Good luck out there.

1145
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:58,289
You, too, Coach.

1146
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:01,980
Okay. Come on.

1147
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:04,287
Everybody, get in here. Come on.

1148
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:08,927
Danny, quit looking at the mountain.

1149
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:10,969
It's not going away and neither are you.

1150
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:12,610
You're gonna be all right.

1151
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:14,848
I've seen you out in the fields.

1152
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:16,246
You're an ox.

1153
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:20,124
So when you're in pain
out there on this mountain,

1154
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:22,601
I want you to remember,
so is the guy next to you,

1155
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:24,171
and the guy in front of you.

1156
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:26,961
This is gonna come down to which
runners can handle the pain.

1157
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:29,220
So I want you to look at them,

1158
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:32,380
and I want you to look
at each other and ask yourself,

1159
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:33,845
"Who's tougher?"

1160
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:38,209
My money's on you.

1161
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:39,321
Call it, Danny.

1162
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:44,804
Uno, dos, tres.

1163
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,604
- McFarland!
- Come on.

1164
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:47,700
Runners, on your mark.

1165
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:49,165
Okay, let's go.

1166
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:54,603
Nice shorts, dude.

1167
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:55,900
You play golf?

1168
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,047
Yeah, I do.

1169
01:21:58,040 --> 01:21:59,280
This ain't golf.

1170
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:00,680
Set...

1171
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:44,208
Run! Run!

1172
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:47,487
Come on.

1173
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:53,281
- Go!
- Come on!

1174
01:23:57,200 --> 01:23:58,201
Go!

1175
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:00,801
Come on.

1176
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:12,321
Come on, you got it!

1177
01:24:13,640 --> 01:24:15,005
Push it, push it!

1178
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:23,500
How did we do? Did we make it?

1179
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:24,601
It's close.

1180
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:28,845
We're right on the edge.

1181
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:12,567
Look at that.

1182
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:15,889
Look at that. You did it.

1183
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:19,842
Best in California.

1184
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:22,843
McFarland's going to State,
you hear that?

1185
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:25,049
We're going to State.

1186
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:27,887
McFarland is going to State.

1187
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:08,961
Hey, Coach,

1188
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:11,721
you missed the turn.

1189
01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:14,043
That's right.

1190
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:29,761
Hi.

1191
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:33,088
That will be $9.50.

1192
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:37,607
Look, I...

1193
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:41,131
I got...

1194
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:44,449
I got five bucks, all right?

1195
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:47,122
I got five bucks
and seven kids back there,

1196
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:50,091
that have never seen the ocean.

1197
01:26:54,640 --> 01:26:55,926
- Keep it.
- Are you sure?

1198
01:26:56,640 --> 01:26:57,766
Keep it.

1199
01:26:58,520 --> 01:26:59,521
Thanks.

1200
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:33,365
Well, go on.

1201
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:36,691
Get in there.

1202
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:38,126
Yeah, let's go, guys!

1203
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:51,249
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1204
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:55,321
We're going to State!

1205
01:27:56,040 --> 01:27:57,041
Yeah!

1206
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:14,720
Okay, no, just stay.
No moving. No moving.

1207
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:21,483
Okay. McFarland Cougars!

1208
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:31,530
That's fantastic.

1209
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:34,561
Wow.

1210
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:44,929
Does Cougars look like
it's spelled right to you?

1211
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:46,889
You tell her and we kill you, man.

1212
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:48,565
Danny!

1213
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:53,886
Yay!

1214
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:02,601
I see David!

1215
01:29:03,080 --> 01:29:05,731
Damacio!

1216
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:09,284
Okay, foto. Ven.

1217
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:13,051
No. No, don't say to me "no." Come on.

1218
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:17,610
Okay. Cougars, one, two, three.

1219
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:19,125
Cougars!

1220
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:21,370
Okay.

1221
01:29:27,080 --> 01:29:28,809
My family.

1222
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:30,644
You must be very proud.

1223
01:29:32,440 --> 01:29:34,249
How old are your daughters,
Señor Blanco?

1224
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:39,841
Jamie's 10 and Julie just turned 15.

1225
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:42,806
When is her quinceañera?

1226
01:29:44,240 --> 01:29:45,241
What?

1227
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:55,524
I'm gonna put it in the front window.

1228
01:29:55,680 --> 01:29:57,603
Can you imagine if we beat
the whole damn state?

1229
01:29:58,160 --> 01:30:00,128
I might actually have to
close the store for a day.

1230
01:30:00,280 --> 01:30:02,169
First time in 25 years.

1231
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:03,805
Sammy, I think...

1232
01:30:06,120 --> 01:30:08,646
I think I'm gonna need
your help with something.

1233
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,367
Come on, guys, gotta go. Come on.

1234
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:13,540
You'll be late.

1235
01:30:13,640 --> 01:30:16,007
Made the appointment for 4:00.

1236
01:30:16,840 --> 01:30:18,001
Why are you doing this?

1237
01:30:18,160 --> 01:30:22,006
I appreciate you. Can't a man
show a little appreciation?

1238
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:24,531
Okay.

1239
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:34,161
We got three hours.

1240
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:40,684
Okay. So...

1241
01:30:42,640 --> 01:30:45,371
I guess we move this picnic table

1242
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:47,041
over here, right?

1243
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:50,042
Blanco, this is gonna go a lot quicker,

1244
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:52,168
if we remember one important thing.

1245
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:54,004
- Yeah, what's that?
- We're not the chiefs,

1246
01:30:54,160 --> 01:30:56,208
we're the Indians. Sit down.

1247
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:08,887
Can one of you move this table to the
garage, because this is the dance floor.

1248
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:11,202
Let me take care of that.
Get up, Thomas.

1249
01:31:24,680 --> 01:31:26,740
- It's so good to see you.
- Come on in, my ladies.

1250
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:29,820
We're gonna make you look so beautiful!

1251
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:32,241
Oh, my goodness, look at this hair.

1252
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:03,046
Here.

1253
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:08,248
What is it? What is it?

1254
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:09,970
Oh, my gosh.

1255
01:32:25,800 --> 01:32:27,529
It's called a quinceañera.

1256
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,321
- Give me that drink.
- All right.

1257
01:32:57,360 --> 01:33:01,649
Señoras y señores, Miss Julie White.

1258
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:18,530
Pretty.

1259
01:33:32,680 --> 01:33:35,047
Time to talk, Papacito.

1260
01:33:41,240 --> 01:33:44,300
First, I'd like to thank
the Rosaldo family,

1261
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:47,609
who were so kind
to help me put this together.

1262
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:50,980
And to everyone here

1263
01:33:51,080 --> 01:33:53,765
who have been so generous
to us along the way.

1264
01:33:58,200 --> 01:34:01,620
And muchos gracias for
helping me to understand

1265
01:34:01,720 --> 01:34:04,883
what a quinceañera means,

1266
01:34:06,040 --> 01:34:08,008
and why this night is so important.

1267
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:09,851
Because it means,

1268
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,844
our daughter's turning
from this young girl

1269
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:15,569
to a beautiful woman.

1270
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:20,806
I don't know if Julie knows

1271
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:24,367
how much I've struggled with this,

1272
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:26,200
but tonight I celebrate it.

1273
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:30,240
I hope you know how much
you mean to me, and how

1274
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:32,660
being your dad and Jamie's,

1275
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:35,491
makes me prouder than you'll ever know.

1276
01:34:37,240 --> 01:34:40,449
And how I hope to one day

1277
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:42,809
make you proud, too.

1278
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:48,921
As proud...

1279
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:52,762
As proud as these kids are
of their parents.

1280
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:56,442
So, now I guess
I get to ask you to dance.

1281
01:34:57,240 --> 01:34:58,605
And...

1282
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:02,010
And apparently,
you're not allowed to say no.

1283
01:35:08,320 --> 01:35:09,970
Thank you, Dad.

1284
01:35:16,720 --> 01:35:18,802
You look so beautiful.

1285
01:35:19,680 --> 01:35:20,806
Thank you.

1286
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:41,601
Julie?

1287
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:44,327
Yes?

1288
01:36:04,360 --> 01:36:05,691
My grandmother made it.

1289
01:36:10,040 --> 01:36:11,041
You're welcome.

1290
01:36:14,240 --> 01:36:15,366
Here, would you?

1291
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:16,646
Yeah.

1292
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:26,047
Are you ready?

1293
01:36:28,040 --> 01:36:29,530
For what?

1294
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:30,886
Come on.

1295
01:36:42,760 --> 01:36:45,730
Relax, Blanco. This is what we do.

1296
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:47,723
We take the birthday girl on parade.

1297
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:49,723
Dad, can I?

1298
01:36:50,280 --> 01:36:51,611
You got her?

1299
01:36:52,440 --> 01:36:53,521
I got her.

1300
01:36:56,600 --> 01:36:57,726
You'll go slow, right?

1301
01:36:58,120 --> 01:36:59,884
It's the only way we go, brother.

1302
01:37:00,240 --> 01:37:01,287
Low and slow.

1303
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:06,081
All right.

1304
01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:08,401
Thank you.

1305
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:16,326
Let's go.

1306
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:21,380
You look beautiful!

1307
01:37:21,480 --> 01:37:23,244
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1308
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:33,290
Bye!

1309
01:37:44,040 --> 01:37:45,121
Thanks for driving, Javi.

1310
01:38:00,040 --> 01:38:02,646
Wow, thank you so much!

1311
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:17,801
Javi.

1312
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:29,085
My God, Javi,
why won't they leave you in peace?

1313
01:38:30,640 --> 01:38:34,201
It was so amazing. So amazing.

1314
01:38:37,240 --> 01:38:38,844
Get it, please?

1315
01:38:40,680 --> 01:38:42,569
Quinceañera headquarters.

1316
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:46,885
Excuse me?

1317
01:38:50,680 --> 01:38:51,806
Get the keys.

1318
01:38:51,920 --> 01:38:53,046
Why?

1319
01:38:54,360 --> 01:38:55,780
There.

1320
01:38:55,880 --> 01:38:57,740
No, please. Dear God, no.

1321
01:38:57,840 --> 01:38:59,365
That doesn't mean anything yet, honey.

1322
01:39:00,520 --> 01:39:02,887
Baby... Please, please, please.

1323
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:09,660
Julie!

1324
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:10,886
Julie, oh, baby!

1325
01:39:11,120 --> 01:39:12,246
Oh, baby.

1326
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:13,960
Julie, sweetheart.

1327
01:39:14,200 --> 01:39:15,201
Mom, I'm okay.

1328
01:39:15,680 --> 01:39:17,020
Please, is she okay?

1329
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:18,700
Stay calm, miss.

1330
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:20,780
- I fell.
- I know, I know.

1331
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:22,086
This car came out of nowhere...

1332
01:39:22,720 --> 01:39:24,210
Then this other car came.

1333
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:26,620
And then some guys got out
and everyone was yelling,

1334
01:39:26,720 --> 01:39:28,210
and there was all this blood.

1335
01:39:29,640 --> 01:39:31,642
- They had knives.
- It's okay.

1336
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:32,921
What do you mean?

1337
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:34,041
What happened?

1338
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:36,768
What happened? You said you had her!

1339
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:38,291
You said she was safe!

1340
01:39:38,640 --> 01:39:39,641
I trusted you.

1341
01:39:40,480 --> 01:39:42,323
I trusted you with my daughter.

1342
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:43,766
She was safe.

1343
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:46,651
Maybe you ought to ask her
just how safe she was.

1344
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:09,020
She wasn't hurt, Jim.

1345
01:40:09,120 --> 01:40:10,820
She's all right. She's gonna be fine.

1346
01:40:10,920 --> 01:40:12,980
Fine? No.

1347
01:40:13,080 --> 01:40:14,140
Not fine.

1348
01:40:14,240 --> 01:40:16,129
Not fine at all. It was a bloodbath!

1349
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:19,645
Half a mile away from our home
with our daughter!

1350
01:40:21,160 --> 01:40:22,525
Not fine.

1351
01:40:52,720 --> 01:40:53,721
Mom.

1352
01:40:55,920 --> 01:40:58,446
Hi, baby. Come here.

1353
01:40:59,480 --> 01:41:01,740
How are you feeling?

1354
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:03,171
Fine.

1355
01:41:05,160 --> 01:41:06,525
Where's Dad?

1356
01:41:28,720 --> 01:41:29,740
Good morning, Jim.

1357
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:32,411
Good to see ya. Thanks for coming.

1358
01:41:40,280 --> 01:41:41,930
- Hey.
- Hi.

1359
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:44,211
How'd it go?

1360
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:49,968
They offered me a full-time position.

1361
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:52,722
Cross country and track.

1362
01:41:53,360 --> 01:41:56,125
It's a state-of-the-art facility.
I'd be head of the program.

1363
01:41:57,920 --> 01:41:59,126
Gonna take it?

1364
01:42:02,040 --> 01:42:03,201
I don't know. Where are the girls?

1365
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:07,721
Jamie's in her bedroom
and Julie's with Sonia, upset.

1366
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:10,121
Does she know?

1367
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:12,966
She knows where you went.

1368
01:42:33,400 --> 01:42:34,481
Julie.

1369
01:42:36,240 --> 01:42:37,287
Julie.

1370
01:42:41,160 --> 01:42:42,286
Get in the car, please.

1371
01:42:57,080 --> 01:42:58,969
Were you even gonna tell us?

1372
01:43:00,240 --> 01:43:01,860
Or were you just gonna
watch us compete at State

1373
01:43:01,960 --> 01:43:04,406
then run off into the sunset
with those country club kids?

1374
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:08,380
Were you even gonna say adiós, Blanco?

1375
01:43:08,480 --> 01:43:10,130
- Thomas, listen to me.
- No.

1376
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:12,805
All right, I get it.

1377
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:14,849
We all get it.

1378
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:16,610
This is America, right?

1379
01:43:17,800 --> 01:43:19,450
You gotta go bigger.

1380
01:43:19,680 --> 01:43:21,444
Find a nicer place.

1381
01:43:21,960 --> 01:43:23,325
Better pay...

1382
01:43:24,120 --> 01:43:25,645
With better everything.

1383
01:43:27,240 --> 01:43:30,244
Everyone is always gonna
go for the better everything.

1384
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:32,740
And that's why no one stays in McFarland

1385
01:43:32,840 --> 01:43:34,569
unless they have to.

1386
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:39,201
Because there ain't nothing
"American dream" about this place.

1387
01:43:49,320 --> 01:43:52,005
It feels like everything
we've ever wanted.

1388
01:43:52,200 --> 01:43:53,531
Everything we've ever talked about.

1389
01:43:53,640 --> 01:43:54,846
You know, big house,

1390
01:43:55,680 --> 01:43:58,001
financial security,

1391
01:43:58,480 --> 01:44:01,980
great school for the kids,
nice neighborhood.

1392
01:44:02,080 --> 01:44:04,526
Nice safe neighborhood.

1393
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:08,050
I don't know.

1394
01:44:10,040 --> 01:44:11,849
What do you mean you don't know?

1395
01:44:12,520 --> 01:44:14,140
The owner of the corner store

1396
01:44:14,240 --> 01:44:16,060
was washing away blood
from his parking lot

1397
01:44:16,160 --> 01:44:18,322
when I drove out this morning.

1398
01:44:19,320 --> 01:44:22,608
Jim, the owner of the store has a name,

1399
01:44:22,840 --> 01:44:24,888
and he's our friend.

1400
01:44:26,520 --> 01:44:28,170
And you looked him in the eye
two days ago

1401
01:44:28,280 --> 01:44:29,780
and thanked him for
everything he's done for us.

1402
01:44:29,880 --> 01:44:31,848
I know. I know.

1403
01:44:32,760 --> 01:44:34,820
But you were there. We were there.

1404
01:44:34,920 --> 01:44:36,620
Julie was... How close?

1405
01:44:36,720 --> 01:44:38,260
This close?

1406
01:44:38,360 --> 01:44:41,045
How can that not bother you?

1407
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:43,860
It bothers me.

1408
01:44:43,960 --> 01:44:46,042
Of course it bothers me.

1409
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:48,209
But do you know how she got hurt?

1410
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:51,406
Your team jumped in front of her.

1411
01:44:52,360 --> 01:44:54,780
They pushed her out of the way.

1412
01:44:54,880 --> 01:44:57,820
They protected her
like she was their family.

1413
01:44:57,920 --> 01:45:00,540
You think she's gonna
find that in Palo Alto?

1414
01:45:00,640 --> 01:45:02,563
Or anywhere else for that matter?

1415
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:04,643
I don't know.

1416
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:11,566
It's your decision, okay?

1417
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:16,163
And I know it's hard.

1418
01:45:18,240 --> 01:45:21,881
But, please don't just let
this be about our safety.

1419
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:29,088
Because nowhere I've ever lived
has ever felt this much like home.

1420
01:45:33,840 --> 01:45:35,126
Okay.

1421
01:45:38,240 --> 01:45:40,925
Coach! Coach! Coach!

1422
01:45:45,480 --> 01:45:46,481
Yeah!

1423
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:49,610
Cougars! Cougars! Cougars!

1424
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:51,444
It's for you!

1425
01:45:54,920 --> 01:45:56,604
Good luck!

1426
01:45:56,760 --> 01:45:58,444
Coach! Coach! Coach!

1427
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:06,883
Bring it home, Jim.

1428
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:09,522
Make us proud, Coach!

1429
01:46:20,120 --> 01:46:21,690
Why are you even here?

1430
01:46:22,040 --> 01:46:23,485
All right, we don't need you to coach.

1431
01:46:26,160 --> 01:46:28,970
Rules say you can't run without a coach.

1432
01:46:29,120 --> 01:46:30,724
You forfeit the race.

1433
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:32,530
So if you still wanna run, Thomas,

1434
01:46:33,480 --> 01:46:34,811
you're gonna need to take a seat.

1435
01:47:00,160 --> 01:47:01,161
Great day!

1436
01:47:35,360 --> 01:47:36,771
I think he's over there. Right there.

1437
01:48:34,440 --> 01:48:35,965
Check. Mic check.

1438
01:48:36,080 --> 01:48:38,082
Testing, testing!

1439
01:48:40,760 --> 01:48:42,091
All right, guys. Here we go.

1440
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:45,740
Check, check, check.

1441
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:47,444
How's that?

1442
01:48:59,120 --> 01:49:01,964
Please rise for the singing
of the national anthem.

1443
01:49:04,120 --> 01:49:05,580
Oh, say can you see...

1444
01:49:05,680 --> 01:49:06,966
Up.

1445
01:49:07,720 --> 01:49:11,566
By the dawn's early light

1446
01:49:12,200 --> 01:49:16,569
What so proudly we hailed

1447
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:20,885
At the twilight's last gleaming

1448
01:49:21,240 --> 01:49:24,403
Whose broad stripes and bright stars

1449
01:49:25,640 --> 01:49:29,486
Through the perilous fight

1450
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:34,005
O'er the ramparts we watched

1451
01:49:34,160 --> 01:49:38,882
Were so gallantly streaming

1452
01:49:39,240 --> 01:49:43,325
And the rocket's red glare

1453
01:50:17,360 --> 01:50:24,050
...and the home of the brave

1454
01:50:34,160 --> 01:50:36,561
Coaches, you have three minutes.

1455
01:50:37,560 --> 01:50:39,164
All right, everybody, gather around.

1456
01:50:40,040 --> 01:50:41,405
Come on.

1457
01:50:41,560 --> 01:50:43,608
I want you to look around.

1458
01:50:44,040 --> 01:50:45,610
Best in the state, right?

1459
01:50:46,600 --> 01:50:48,728
Every team that's here deserves to be,

1460
01:50:49,320 --> 01:50:51,004
including you.

1461
01:50:51,720 --> 01:50:54,564
But they haven't got what you got.
All right?

1462
01:50:54,800 --> 01:50:57,724
They don't get up at dawn like you
and go to work in the fields.

1463
01:50:57,920 --> 01:50:59,410
Right?

1464
01:50:59,560 --> 01:51:03,006
They don't go to school all day
and then go back to those same fields.

1465
01:51:03,160 --> 01:51:04,924
That's what you do.

1466
01:51:05,560 --> 01:51:09,020
And then you come out with me
and you run 8 miles, 10 miles,

1467
01:51:09,120 --> 01:51:10,660
and you take on...

1468
01:51:10,760 --> 01:51:11,900
You take on even more pain.

1469
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:15,004
These kids don't do what you do.
They can't even imagine it.

1470
01:51:18,320 --> 01:51:20,482
When I went out in the field
that day with you Diaz kids,

1471
01:51:20,640 --> 01:51:22,324
I'll be honest with you, it was a...

1472
01:51:24,040 --> 01:51:26,327
It was the worst day's work
I ever had to do in my life.

1473
01:51:27,200 --> 01:51:30,460
And I said to myself, "Whatever
kind of crappy job I end up in,

1474
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:32,562
"it'll never be as tough as that."

1475
01:51:35,360 --> 01:51:37,420
You kids do it every day.

1476
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:39,540
And your parents hope
they can do it every day,

1477
01:51:39,640 --> 01:51:43,326
and they'll do it for a lifetime
if it means a better life for you.

1478
01:51:49,960 --> 01:51:51,644
You guys are super-human.

1479
01:51:52,280 --> 01:51:54,940
What you endure just to be here,
to get a shot at this,

1480
01:51:55,040 --> 01:51:58,089
the kind of privilege
that someone like me takes for granted?

1481
01:51:59,800 --> 01:52:02,940
There's nothing you can't do
with that kind of strength,

1482
01:52:03,040 --> 01:52:04,929
with that kind of heart.

1483
01:52:07,120 --> 01:52:09,441
You kids have the biggest hearts
I've ever seen.

1484
01:52:14,680 --> 01:52:16,887
Now go run your race.

1485
01:52:17,080 --> 01:52:19,401
Thomas, you're the captain.

1486
01:52:40,040 --> 01:52:41,644
Hey, Coach.

1487
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:44,851
You wanna call it?

1488
01:52:58,840 --> 01:53:01,286
Uno, dos, tres.

1489
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:02,601
McFarland!

1490
01:53:15,640 --> 01:53:16,971
Gentlemen,

1491
01:53:17,120 --> 01:53:19,600
your command will be
"Runners, take your mark,"

1492
01:53:19,960 --> 01:53:21,564
followed by the pistol.

1493
01:53:22,600 --> 01:53:24,170
I will not fire the gun,

1494
01:53:24,640 --> 01:53:27,211
until I see that everyone
is standing still

1495
01:53:27,360 --> 01:53:29,522
with your toes behind the line.

1496
01:53:31,280 --> 01:53:33,044
Good luck today, gentlemen.

1497
01:53:34,480 --> 01:53:36,562
Runners, take your mark!

1498
01:54:02,280 --> 01:54:03,566
Jose, no.

1499
01:54:04,120 --> 01:54:05,326
Jose!

1500
01:54:13,280 --> 01:54:14,281
What's he doing?

1501
01:54:15,040 --> 01:54:16,371
Jose, back it down!

1502
01:54:16,520 --> 01:54:17,760
Find your pace!

1503
01:54:17,880 --> 01:54:19,120
Come on! Come on! Go, go, go.

1504
01:54:19,320 --> 01:54:20,731
He's too fast! He's gonna die!

1505
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:22,882
Then make up for it! Make up for it!

1506
01:54:23,320 --> 01:54:24,700
Where's Victor?

1507
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:26,723
You're right there, Victor.
You're right there.

1508
01:54:26,920 --> 01:54:29,366
Damacio, stay right with him.
Hold onto Victor!

1509
01:54:29,520 --> 01:54:30,851
Keep those legs! Let's go!

1510
01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:31,961
Good, Johnny!

1511
01:54:32,600 --> 01:54:33,647
Come on, Johnny!

1512
01:54:33,760 --> 01:54:35,000
Catch that next group, Johnny.

1513
01:54:35,160 --> 01:54:36,207
Get into that next group!

1514
01:54:42,520 --> 01:54:43,885
Keep going!

1515
01:54:59,240 --> 01:55:01,129
Sorry, man. Sorry.

1516
01:55:03,240 --> 01:55:04,220
Here they are.

1517
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:05,940
Yay, McFarland! Go, guys!

1518
01:55:06,040 --> 01:55:07,100
Come on, McFarland!

1519
01:55:07,200 --> 01:55:09,567
Damacio! McFarland!

1520
01:55:12,640 --> 01:55:13,971
What's happening, Mom?

1521
01:55:14,120 --> 01:55:15,531
Looks like he's run out of gas.

1522
01:55:15,720 --> 01:55:17,290
The others will have
to make up the points.

1523
01:55:39,160 --> 01:55:40,500
That's it. Pick up the pace!

1524
01:55:40,600 --> 01:55:42,140
Let's go! Let's go!
Close it up! Close it up!

1525
01:55:42,240 --> 01:55:43,420
Let's go! Cut the distance!

1526
01:55:43,520 --> 01:55:44,500
You're stretching it out!

1527
01:55:44,600 --> 01:55:45,580
Come on!

1528
01:55:45,680 --> 01:55:48,047
10:00 flat, Thomas! Come on!
You can do it!

1529
01:55:48,200 --> 01:55:50,521
You gotta get ahead of three guys!
Come on!

1530
01:55:51,120 --> 01:55:52,100
Come on, Victor!

1531
01:55:52,200 --> 01:55:53,300
Only seconds off pace! Let's go!

1532
01:55:53,400 --> 01:55:54,925
Come on, Damacio!

1533
01:55:55,440 --> 01:55:57,260
Hold onto those guys! Hold onto them!

1534
01:55:57,360 --> 01:55:58,500
Lets' go!

1535
01:55:58,600 --> 01:56:00,284
Bring it up! Bring it up!

1536
01:56:36,400 --> 01:56:39,483
McFarland!

1537
01:56:49,320 --> 01:56:50,321
Beat him, Thomas.

1538
01:57:02,640 --> 01:57:03,641
Yes!

1539
01:57:08,520 --> 01:57:10,443
Damacio, come on! There's Damacio!

1540
01:57:13,200 --> 01:57:14,247
Yes!

1541
01:57:17,520 --> 01:57:19,409
- Where's Jose?
- I don't know.

1542
01:57:20,600 --> 01:57:21,900
Come on.

1543
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,844
He's more than a minute slower
than his usual times. It's...

1544
01:57:25,600 --> 01:57:27,300
It's not gonna be enough.

1545
01:57:27,400 --> 01:57:31,405
Look, David will come in next,
but not for another 30 seconds. See.

1546
01:57:31,600 --> 01:57:33,820
- Coach... Coach.
- Even then, it's not gonna...

1547
01:57:33,920 --> 01:57:35,860
- It's not gonna matter unless...
- Coach.

1548
01:57:35,960 --> 01:57:37,644
You can do it. Yeah.

1549
01:57:40,960 --> 01:57:42,660
That's not Danny Diaz.

1550
01:57:42,760 --> 01:57:44,922
- Come on, Danny!
- That's not Danny Diaz!

1551
01:57:47,680 --> 01:57:48,727
Come on! Yeah!

1552
01:58:01,560 --> 01:58:03,403
- Danny!
- Danny!

1553
01:58:03,960 --> 01:58:04,961
Yeah!

1554
01:58:17,040 --> 01:58:18,451
Number five.

1555
01:58:18,600 --> 01:58:20,250
You're our number five runner, man!

1556
01:58:20,960 --> 01:58:23,042
Did you picture
the finish line as a donut or what?

1557
01:58:26,600 --> 01:58:27,620
Hey...

1558
01:58:27,720 --> 01:58:29,780
Hey, where did you come from, Diaz?

1559
01:58:29,880 --> 01:58:31,484
Where did you come from?

1560
01:58:31,760 --> 01:58:33,808
From McFarland, Coach.

1561
01:59:14,400 --> 01:59:15,606
Let's go.

1562
01:59:31,280 --> 01:59:33,760
Ladies and gentlemen,
we do apologize for the delay.

1563
01:59:34,640 --> 01:59:37,620
It was a very close race
and we needed to be sure.

1564
01:59:37,720 --> 01:59:40,644
But we can now announce
that the first ever

1565
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:44,043
California State Cross Country
Champion team is...

1566
01:59:45,960 --> 01:59:47,007
McFarland!

1567
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:52,060
The McFarland High School Cougars
are the cross-country champs

1568
01:59:52,160 --> 01:59:54,561
of the state of California.
Congratulations.

1569
01:59:59,920 --> 02:00:02,764
Boo-yah! We won! I can't believe we won!

1570
02:00:13,520 --> 02:00:14,806
State Champ!

1571
02:00:17,720 --> 02:00:18,846
McFarland!

1572
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:20,729
McFarland, baby!

1573
02:00:20,880 --> 02:00:21,927
McFarland!

1574
02:00:35,640 --> 02:00:36,801
Danny!

1575
02:00:45,200 --> 02:00:47,407
Yeah! McFarland!

1576
02:01:31,440 --> 02:01:32,566
McFarland?

1577
02:01:33,840 --> 02:01:36,411
McFarland. McFarland.

1578
02:01:40,160 --> 02:01:41,366
McFarland!

1579
02:01:59,360 --> 02:02:02,409
McFarland! McFarland!
