than I ever dreamed

12
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,770

than I ever imagined.

Oh, man, he showed me things

19
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:06,166
There were these disk battles
fought in spectacular arenas.

21
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,588
It was so radical.

BOY: You built the Grid.

23
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:17,636

for programs and users.

24
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:20,055
Now, I couldn't be in there all the time,

25
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:25,227

that could think.

Good evening. Our lead story.

51
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:14,920
ENCOM CEO and video game icon
Kevin Flynn has disappeared.

52
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:18,090
He was best known for designing Tron
and Space Paranoids,

53
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:20,926
the two bestselling video games
in history.

54
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:24,137
Flynn took ownership of ENCOM
in 1982

55
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:27,599
as the company skyrocketed
to the top of the tech industry.

56
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:32,020
But things changed in 1985
with the untimely death of Flynn's wife,

57
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,606
the mother of his young son, Sam.

58
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,692
Recently, ENCOM board members

59
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,026
have been troubled by reports

60
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,113
of Flynn's erratic,
even obsessive, behavior.

61
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:44,908
With Flynn missing,
the company is now in chaos.

62
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,202
This afternoon, ENCOM's board

63
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,455
moved to seize control
from Flynn's partner, Alan Bradley,

64
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,542
vowing to return the company
to profitability.

65
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:58,839
Loyal to the end, Bradley maintains
his belief that Flynn is not missing

66
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:01,550
and is instead pursuing his dream of

67
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:05,095
"a digital frontier
to reshape the human condition."

00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:09,182

Kevin Flynn may have simply

hope for his imminent return,

to happen more than young Sam Flynn,

543
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:46,931
(QUORRA LAUGHS)

544
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:55,105
Work?

545
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:58,567
-KEVIN: Job? ENCOM? Are you...
-No.

546
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:03,239
I check in once a year.

547
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:06,784
-Wife, girlfriend?
-Dog.

548
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:09,578
Marvin.

549
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,789
-A rescue.
-KEVIN: Well, dogs...

550
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:13,666
Dogs are cool.

551
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:26,637
I'm sure you must have
a few questions of your own, Sam.

552
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:31,016
Actually, just one.

553
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:36,355
Why I never came home.

554
00:54:40,193 --> 00:54:42,945
Those nights when I went to the office,

555
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:46,365
I'm sure you've figured it out by now,
I was coming here.

556
00:54:47,492 --> 00:54:50,286
Human form into digital space.

557
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:52,454
Heavy stuff.

558
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:56,625
But I also had you.

559
00:54:56,710 --> 00:55:00,170
I had ENCOM.
I couldn't be in here all the time.

560
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:02,965
I needed partners to help out.

561
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:04,758
Tron and Clu?

562
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:06,719
That's right.

563
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:12,850
KEVIN: Tron was created by AIan
for the old system.

564
00:55:12,934 --> 00:55:15,102
I brought him here to protect this one.

565
00:55:15,186 --> 00:55:17,438
Clu was my creation.

566
00:55:17,522 --> 00:55:21,317
A program designed
to create a perfect world.

567
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:25,237
We were jamming, man,
building utopia.

568
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:27,823
Hours in here
were just minutes back home.

569
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:30,701
Just when I thought
it couldn't get any more profound,

570
00:55:30,785 --> 00:55:32,995
something unexpected happened.

571
00:55:33,621 --> 00:55:37,541
The miracle.

572
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:39,293
You remember.

573
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:43,797
ISOs. Isomorphic algorithms.

574
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:48,344
-A whole new life form.
-And you created them?

575
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:50,429
(LAUGHS)

576
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:54,391
No. No.

577
00:55:54,476 --> 00:55:58,062
They manifested, like a flame.

578
00:55:58,146 --> 00:56:01,065
They weren't really from anywhere.

579
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:04,068
The conditions were right
and they came into being.

580
00:56:05,111 --> 00:56:08,947
For centuries we've dreamed
of gods, spirits, aliens,

581
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:11,075
an intelligence beyond our own.

582
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:12,493
You seeing this?

583
00:56:12,577 --> 00:56:17,247
I found them in here.
Like flowers in a wasteland.

584
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:22,711
Profoundly naive.

585
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:27,174
Unimaginably wise.

586

(CHUCKLES)

587
00:56:28,843 --> 00:56:31,053
They were spectacular.

588
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:33,972
Everything I'd hoped to find
in the system,

589
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:36,558
control, order, perfection,

590
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:38,060
none of it meant a thing.

591
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:39,436
I'd been living in a hall of mirrors.

592
00:56:40,438 --> 00:56:43,107
The ISOs shattered it.

593
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:46,777
The possibilities of their root code,
their digital DNA.

594
00:56:46,861 --> 00:56:49,321
Disease? History.

595
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:51,740
Science, philosophy,

596
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:56,036
every idea man has ever had
about the universe up for grabs.

597
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:58,956
Bio-digital jazz, man.

598
00:56:59,707 --> 00:57:03,252
The lSOs, they were going
to be my gift to the world.

599
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:05,712
SAM: So what happened?

600
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:09,258
KEVIN: Clu. Clu happened.

601
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:15,222
TRON: Your transport to the portal
is waiting for you.

602
00:57:15,306 --> 00:57:17,433
I don't like it when you cut it this close.

603
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:21,603
KEVIN: Will you stop worrying, Tron?
Everything's just fine.

604
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:23,856
-Everything's under control.
-CLU: Flynn!

605
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:31,196
Am I still to create the perfect system?

606
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:34,366
Yeah.

607
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:38,871
KEVIN: It was a coup.

608
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:42,332
TRON: Go.

609
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:58,432
CLU: You've been corrupted.

610
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:11,361
Why? Why?

611
00:58:14,073 --> 00:58:15,199
Flynn, go!

l never saw him again.

615
00:58:29,964 --> 00:58:31,673
So why didn't you fight?

-KEVIN: Hmm.
-He did.

617
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:36,011
KEVIN: Clu fed on my resistance.

618
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:38,847
The more I fought,
the more powerful he became.

619
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:41,642
It was impressive, really.

620
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:47,105
And my miracle...
Clu saw the lSOs as an imperfection.

621
00:58:47,732 --> 00:58:49,691
So he destroyed them.

-He killed them all?
-It was genocide.

but l couldn't get to the portal.

and it can't stay open forever.

lt can only be opened from the outside.

629
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:19,096
It closed on me, Sam.

630
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:22,057
That's why I never came home.

631
00:59:29,023 --> 00:59:31,233
SAM: So the portal, it activated

632
00:59:31,317 --> 00:59:34,069
when I came in. So it's open now.

633
00:59:34,153 --> 00:59:35,195
KEVIN: Not for long.

00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,906
Only one millicycle, about eight hours.

635
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:41,368
So we go now. Go home.
We make a run for it.

-We get you out of here.
-Don't rush.

What? What is it?

639
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:53,839
The moment Flynn is on the Grid, Clu
will stop at nothing to obtain his disk.

640

My disk is everything, Sam.

641
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:59,553
It's the master key. The golden ticket.

-And not just for me.
-What do you mean?

Our worlds are more connected
than anyone knows.

645
01:00:09,355 --> 01:00:11,064
SAM: He can be out?

646
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:14,735
KEVIN: With my disk, it's possible.
SAM: And then what?

647
01:00:15,361 --> 01:00:17,112
Game over.

The guy doesn't dig imperfection.

What's more imperfect than our world?

650
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:29,625
I can't let that happen. I won't.

651
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:33,253
So what do we do? Nothing?

652
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:36,298
It's amazing how productive
doing nothing can be.

653
01:00:36,382 --> 01:00:40,010
Clu's planning something.
We've known that for a while.

654
01:00:40,386 --> 01:00:41,762
Programs have been disappearing.

655
01:00:41,846 --> 01:00:44,473
There's unrest out there,
even revolution.

656
01:00:44,557 --> 01:00:48,810
If we sit tight, Clu might
be brought down from the inside.

657
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:52,189
SAM: If the portal is closing, we can't
sit around. We have to move now.

658
01:00:52,273 --> 01:00:57,110
Tell me, what brought you here,
to the Grid?

659
01:00:57,612 --> 01:00:59,488
Alan got your page.

660
01:00:59,572 --> 01:01:02,366
I didn't send any page.

661
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:04,076
It was Clu.

662
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:07,037
Clu sent that page.
That's why you're here.

663
01:01:07,121 --> 01:01:10,123
This is all his design.
He wanted a new piece

664
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:12,668
on the board to change the game!

665
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:14,836
With you, he got more
than he ever dreamed.

666
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:20,050
This is precisely what he wants.
Us together heading for the portal.

667
01:01:20,134 --> 01:01:24,304
It's his game now.
The only way to win is not to play.

668
01:01:26,307 --> 01:01:28,225
Well, that's a hell of a way to live.

669
01:01:28,309 --> 01:01:29,935
But it is a way.

670
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:36,566
We can go home.

671
01:01:38,444 --> 01:01:40,404
Don't you want that?

672
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:46,576

past things like wants and hopes.

That's great, Dad.
Keep telling yourself that.

Good night, Sam.

675
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:24,406
How can he be so afraid
of his own creation?

676
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:27,659
I mean, he built Clu.
Why doesn't he just end him?

677
01:02:28,953 --> 01:02:31,037
He could,
but it would require reintegration.

678
01:02:31,122 --> 01:02:32,581
Yeah, all right.

679
01:02:32,665 --> 01:02:36,376
Flynn would never survive the event.
It would mean the end of them both.

then I will.

this thing out from the other side.

in my world, he's gone in one keystroke.

But I can't do anything
unless I get to the portal.

in this place for eternity either.

Thank you for bringing my son to me.

QUORRA: Flynn!

720
01:08:07,792 --> 01:08:10,752
You don't need to go.
I've sent him to someone we can trust.

721
01:08:10,836 --> 01:08:12,962
Quorra, there is no choice.

722
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:16,007
I won't lose him again.

723
01:08:18,010 --> 01:08:21,221

His name is Castor. If you want to speak
to Zuse, you need to go through him.

728
01:09:15,693 --> 01:09:18,319
CASTOR: Where's your sense of humor,
my friend?

729

MAN: Programs are disappearing.
Soon none of us will be left.

730
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:24,534
Zuse can unite the factions,
foment revolution.

731
01:09:24,618 --> 01:09:28,079
-Of course Zuse can do these things.
-Grant me an audience.

732
01:09:28,163 --> 01:09:31,374
Your enthusiasm is intoxicating,
my dear Bartik,

733
01:09:31,458 --> 01:09:34,168
but Zuse's time is precious.

734
01:09:34,253 --> 01:09:36,588
We shall see.

735
01:09:38,215 --> 01:09:40,341
I brought your boy Flynn.

736
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:45,471
If you'll excuse me for a moment,
I have to attend to something.

Come, away from
these primitive functions.

740
01:09:55,274 --> 01:09:57,567
The son of Flynn.

741
01:09:57,651 --> 01:10:02,614
Of all the innumerable possibilities,
he has to walk into mine.

I'm looking for Zuse.

750
01:10:25,804 --> 01:10:28,723
Indeed. Many are.

751
01:10:28,807 --> 01:10:30,725
Where can I find him?

752
01:10:30,809 --> 01:10:34,812
This, pretty miss, is a conversation
best had behind closed doors.

753
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:38,399
Perhaps we should retire
to my private lounge.

754

CASTOR: Zuse has been around

773
01:13:50,968 --> 01:13:52,927
since the earliest days
of the gaming grid.

774
01:13:53,345 --> 01:13:57,473
By necessity,
he has to mind all the percentages.

775
01:13:57,558 --> 01:13:59,475
All the angles.

776
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:01,435
So when do I meet him?

777
01:14:04,022 --> 01:14:07,441

Self-preservation, you understand.

781
01:14:22,082 --> 01:14:26,711
Now, what can I do for you?

782
01:14:29,423 --> 01:14:31,465
I need to get to the portal.

Tick-tock, tick-tock.

786

But first, as a man who prides himself
on staying well informed,

I must ask who sent you my way.

792

Her name's Quorra.

793
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:06,834
