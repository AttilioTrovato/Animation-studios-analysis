1
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,959
That's me, Walter.

2
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,838
Where... Where'd you go?
Oh, there you are!

3
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,753
I have the best life
in the whole world.

4
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,870
That's my brother, Gary.

5
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,508
He's the best friend
you could ever have.

6
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,512
Yeah, I know what you're thinking.

7
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,272
We could be twins.

8
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,115
Here's where we live : Smalltown...

9
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,275
...the best town
you could ever grow up in.

10
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,873
Gary and I did everything together.

11
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,037
And, as the years passed,
my brother was always there for me.

12
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,590
I got it! Gary, throw me! Throw me!

13
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,113
Aaah!

14
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,798
We were a great team.

15
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,633
Nice job, Walter.
Thanks, Gary.

16
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,474
Oh, don't get me wrong.
It's not perfect.

17
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,518
That was so fun!
Nothing is.

18
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,749
Sorry, kid.

19
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,229
I wanna do that again!
Come on. I'll ride with ya!

20
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,628
Hurry up!

21
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,634
Even the sunniest days
can have a few clouds in them.

22
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,596
Ride's bogus, anyway.
Hey, wanna rent a video?

23
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,354
Yeah. Race you home!

24
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,593
And, well, that night
sorta changed everything.

25
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,712
It's The Muppet Show, with our very
special guest star, Mr. Steve Martin!

26
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,797
I found them...

27
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,628
... The Muppets.

28
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,672
I guess you could say
I was their number one fan.

29
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:42,317
Oh, Gary, it's an entire map
of The Muppet Studios.

30
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,077
And they made all the difference.

31
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,629
Trick or treat!
Because from then on...

32
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,233
Hey, guys.
Oh, hey, Gary.

33
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,115
Hey.
Hi-ho, guys. Yay!

34
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,514
Is that Kermit the Frog?
What is this, 1978?

35
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,114
...even on the worst days,
I knew...

36
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,755
...that as the years passed...

37
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,558
Cancel that last remark.

38
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,757
...as long as there are singing
frogs and joking bears...

39
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,469
...Swedish chefs and boomerang fish,

40
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,315
the world can't be such
a bad place after all.

41
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,359
All right, good night, buddy.

42
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,551
Oh, good night, Gary.

43
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,029
And as long
as there are Muppets...

44
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,395
...for me...
...hair-growing tonic.

45
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,437
...there's still...

46
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,034
...hope.

47
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,069
Aaah. Bye-bye!

48
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,152
Somebody get him!

49
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,548
Animal. Hey, Animal, come on.
The show's about to start.

50
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,790
Show! Show!

51
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,397
Hey, Walter, why don't you join us?

52
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,118
Come on!

53
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,673
No! Wait! I want to be
with you guys! Please let me in!

54
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,400
Kermit!

55
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,953
Whoa!

56
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,348
Walter, are you OK, buddy?

57
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,159
You're drenched in sweat.
Did you have the dream again?

58
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:25,070
Ummm. No. Hey, so when are
you guys leaving today?

59
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,396
Oh, um, just a couple hours now.

60
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,111
Oh, wow, Gary, I think it is so cool
you're taking Mary to Los Angeles.

61
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,670
I can't believe you guys
have been dating for ten years.

62
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,274
I know. Yeah, she wanted to do
something special for this anniversary,

63
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,908
and she's always
wanted to see Los Angeles, so...

64
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,640
Hey, don't forget to send me a
postcard from The Muppet Studios.

65
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,673
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.

66
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,594
I can't do that, Walter.
But, Gary...

67
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,830
Because... you're coming with us!

68
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,231
Oh, Gary!

69
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,351
But what about Mary?
She's fine.

70
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,672
She said the more the merrier.
I... I don't know what to say!

71
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,991
The Muppet Studios are there, Gary.
I can't believe this!

72
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,634
Better get a move on.
We don't want to miss that bus!

73
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,588
No way! Who knows?
Maybe Kermit will be there.

74
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,512
I wouldn't get
your hopes up, buddy.

75
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,069
The Muppets haven't put
on a show together in years.

76
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,834
I don't think they use the studios
for anything but tours anymore.

77
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,434
Nah, I think that's
just an Internet rumor.

78
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,238
Like there's a country called Turkey.

79
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,913
Walter, how many times
do we have to go over this?

80
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,071
Turkey is a very real country.
Wow, Muppet Studios.

81
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,151
I can't believe it!

82
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,639
# Everything is great
Everything is grand

83
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,634
# I got the whole wide world
in the palm of my hand

84
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,156
# Everything is perfect
It's falling into place

85
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,830
# I can't seem to wipe
this smile off my face

86
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,039
# Life's a happy song when there's
someone by my side to sing along

87
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,790
# When you're alone
life can be a little rough

88
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,117
# It makes you feel like
you're three foot tall

89
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:08,239
# When it's just you
Well, times can be tough

90
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,709
# When there's no one there
to catch your fall

91
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,311
Whoooa!

92
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,756
# Everything is great
Everything is grand

93
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,993
# I got the whole wide world
in the palm of my hand

94
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,118
# Everything is perfect
It's falling into place

95
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:30,029
# I can't seem to wipe
this smile off my face

96
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,310
# Life smells like a rose
# With someone to paint

97
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,311
# And someone to pose
# Life's a piece of cake

98
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,072
# With someone to pedal
# And someone to brake

99
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,754
# Life is full of glee
# With someone to saw

100
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,190
# And someone to see
# Life's a happy song

101
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,158
# When there's someone
by my side to sing along

102
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:52,715
# I've got everything that I need

103
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,791
# Right in front of me

104
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,679
# Nothing's stoppin' me

105
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,717
# Nothin' that I can't be

106
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,110
# With you right here next to me

107
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,874
# Life's a piece of cake
# With someone to give

108
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,190
# And someone to... Heavy cake!
# Life's a piece of pie

109
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,072
# With someone to wash
# And someone to dry

110
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,840
# Life's an easy road
# With someone beside you

111
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,389
# To share the load
# Life is full of highs

112
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,073
# With someone to stir
# And someone to fry

113
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,878
# Life's a leg of lamb

114
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,877
# With someone there to lend a hand

115
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,229
# Life's a bunch of flowers

116
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,152
# With someone to while away the hours

117
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,834
# Life's a fillet of fish

118
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,150
# Yes, it is
Life's a happy song

119
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:32,916
# When there's someone
by your side to sing along

120
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,518
Oooh...

121
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,629
# I've got everything that I need

122
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,588
# Right in front of me
Nothing's

123
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,354
# Stoppin' me
Nothin' that I can't be

124
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,750
# With you right here next to me

125
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:04,835
# I've got everything that I need

126
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,837
# Right in front of me #

127
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,636
Sorry. I was super excited.

128
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,710
All right, Carlos. Flip the ignition.

129
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,955
And that is how you fix
a 12-volt starter.

130
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,394
Oh!

131
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,989
You know what that means.
Spring break.

132
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,436
It's OK. We'll be back
to studying in two weeks.

133
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,433
Yay!

134
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,830
Have a nice vacation.
Bye. Have fun.

135
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,592
Bye, Mr. Gary.
Have a good break, guys.

136
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,829
Hey, great job, Carlos.
Thanks.

137
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,399
Enjoy your anniversary dinner.

138
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,676
Hi.
I got you these.

139
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:42,310
Oh. Sorry. It's probably from
the dance number I was doing.

140
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,471
It's OK. They're really sweet.

141
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,234
You excited for our big trip to LA?
I have our list.

142
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,233
Me, too.

143
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,152
Oh, this is the
most romantic thing ever.

144
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,550
I've always dreamt
of seeing Los Angeles.

145
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,159
I know. Walter can't wait either.

146
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,197
You don't mind that he's coming, right?

147
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,316
No. No, of course not.

148
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,677
As long as we can spend our anniversary
dinner together. That's all I ask.

149
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:09,470
Totally. It's gonna be the most
romantic anniversary dinner ever.

150
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,039
I love you so much.

151
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,875
Oh.

152
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,069
I love you, too.
I'm gonna go check on Walter.

153
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,435
# Everything's great
Everything's grand

154
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,512
# Except Gary's always off
with his friend

155
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,276
# It's never me and him
It's always me and him and him

156
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,556
# I wonder when it's going to end

157
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,958
# But I guess that's OK
'cause maybe someday

158
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,429
# I know just how it's going to be

159
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,792
# He'll ride up on a steed
Get down on one knee

160
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:51,717
# And say "Mary, will you marry me?"

161
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,789
# Please #

162
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,788
Oh...

163
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:13,798
# I've got everything that I need

164
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,598
# Right in front of me

165
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:20,794
# Nothing's stoppin' me
Nothin' that I can't be

166
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,757
# With you right here next to me

167
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:27,596
# You've got everything that you need

168
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,675
# Right in front of you
Nothing's stopping you

169
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,833
# Nothing that you can't do
that the world can throw at you

170
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,149
# Life's a happy song

171
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,316
# When there's someone
by your side to sing

172
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,515
# Life's a happy song

173
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,148
# When there's someone
by your side to sing

174
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,235
# Life's a happy song when there's
someone by your side to sing along #

175
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,159
OK, they're gone!

176
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,275
Hey, Gary, what should
we do first at Muppet Studio?

177
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,398
'Cause I was thinking that maybe we
could start at Fozzie's Joke Room...

178
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,635
Oh, no, wait, wait, wait.

179
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,075
The lines might be shorter
at Honeydew's Laboratory of Fun,

180
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,074
so maybe we should start there instead.
I just... I just can't wait!

181
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,310
Oh, Walter, don't be nervous.

182
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,916
Oh, I know.
I just can't believe I'm here.

183
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,991
The home of the Muppets!

184
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,196
What... What happened to this place?

185
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:00,950
Where...?

186
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,079
Where is everyone, Gary?
I don't know, buddy. It's so...

187
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,073
OK, well, I guess you guys
are it for today.

188
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,994
Anyway, welcome
to the original Muppet Studio,

189
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,799
where dreams can come true.

190
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,716
Is this the Universal Studios?
Yes, it is.

191
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,156
OK, now if you'll
just follow me, please.

192
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,957
OK. This used to be Kermit's office.

193
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,951
Whoa.
Mm-hmm.

194
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,838
It's really the highlight of the tour.

195
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,678
You should see it sometime.

196
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:43,230
OK, this next building
is where they kept the rope

197
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:48,315
and the medium-gauge wire for the
productions. Let's go take a look.

198
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,159
Come on, buddy.

199
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,471
Wow!

200
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,872
Oh, boy.

201
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,751
Oh.

202
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,552
Whoa.

203
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,990
There. Now this here is
Kermit the Frog's old office.

204
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,276
Or so we've been "toad."

205
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,958
Well, as you know, gentlemen, I've loved
the Muppets since I was a boy.

206
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,876
And what better way
to honor the Muppets

207
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,033
than to make this beautiful
studio a Muppet museum.

208
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,518
I think I'll call this room

209
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,831
the "Kermit the Frog's
Old Office Room."

210
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,797
Oh, that is lovely.
Oh, good one, Mr. Richman.

211
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,873
Now, this here is the standard
"Rich and Famous" contract

212
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,640
Kermit signed 30 years ago,
that contains...

213
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,917
The deed to this property.
Exactly.

214
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:26,518
Now, this contract is 100 percent
ironclad, with one minor exception.

215
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,478
If the Muppets can raise the
ten million dollars it would cost

216
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,035
to buy the building before
this contract expires,

217
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,317
then they get their studio back.
You know, if I didn't know better,

218
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,318
I'd say you were reciting some
sort of an important plot point.

219
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,432
Well, I hope so. Otherwise,
I just bored the audience half to death.

220
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,591
You mean half the audience
is still alive?

221
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,714
It's nice doing business with you.

222
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,872
Yes, sir. Come on.
Goodbye.

223
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,996
I love geriatric humor.

224
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,591
Gentlemen, there's oil
under this studio.

225
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,873
Yeah, I can smell it.

226
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,675
And more importantly, the geological
survey says there definitely is.

227
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:07,156
In two weeks, we tear
this place to the ground

228
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,551
and start drilling. Ah, those Muppets.

229
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,435
They think they're so funny.

230
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:18,633
Well, it looks like
the joke's about to be on them.

231
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,314
Maniacal laugh.

232
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,158
Maniacal laugh.

233
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,312
Maniacal laugh. Maniacal laugh.

234
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,955
Maniacal laugh.

235
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,192
Walter!
Walter?

236
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,588
Walter!
Walter!

237
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,673
Yeah, so then, when he thought
they were alone, he said,

238
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,115
"There's oil
under this studio, see.

239
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,555
I'm gonna tear it to the ground, see.

240
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,996
Sweet, sweet oil, see!"
People still talk like that?

241
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,878
Maybe that's just how
he sounded in my head.

242
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,589
Either way, we've got to find Kermit!
He'll know what to do.

243
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,990
How do we find Kermit?
Nobody's seen him in years.

244
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,988
Stop the car!
I've got an idea!

245
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,158
Mmm.

246
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,753
These are delicious!

247
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,717
Great idea, Walter.
Mm-hmm.

248
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,272
We've been doing this
for a long time.

249
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,759
I think maybe we should
call it a night.

250
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,195
Guys!
We can't give up, Gary.

251
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,158
But it's getting really late. Maybe
we should just go back to the motel.

252
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,117
Guys!
It...

253
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,474
What?
What?

254
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:48,350
Maybe he lives there.
Oh. That's it.

255
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,348
So, what do we do now?

256
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,599
I don't see a doorbell,
and the house looks empty.

257
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,512
Gary, throw me over.
What?

258
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,990
Gary, just throw me over already!
OK.

259
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,675
OK, here we go. OK...
One, two, three.

260
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,439
That's good.
Sorry.

261
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,919
No, it's good.
Guys?

262
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,116
I think that's an electric fence.

263
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,599
Mary, it's Kermit the Frog.

264
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,475
OK, buddy, head down.
One, two, three!

265
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,716
It's an electric fence.
Yep.

266
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:35,669
Oh, my gosh. Walter? Walter, buddy?
Walter, can you hear me?

267
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,434
Throw me again.
No, I don't...

268
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,556
I don't think that's a good idea.

269
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,154
What kind of throw was that?
I think there's somebody coming.

270
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,753
Excuse me...

271
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,153
You OK? That was quite a tumble.

272
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,148
Oh. Look, look. I think...

273
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,276
Hey. Hey, Walter?

274
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,432
Walter, you all right, buddy?
Where am I?

275
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:10,270
OK, this is awesome.
We're at Kermit's house.

276
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,711
Oh, jeez. Walter.
No, no, no, no, no. You OK?

277
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,359
This... This is Kermit's house?

278
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,997
Anyhow, how can I help you guys?

279
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,919
Let me just say, this is an honor
for all of us to meet you, sir,

280
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,236
but my brother, Walter, has some
really disturbing news for you.

281
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,154
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Not now, 80's Robot.

282
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,834
Might I offer you a drink? Tab?

283
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,228
Good grief.
New Coke?

284
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,675
Listen. Not right now,
80's Robot, please!

285
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,438
Bummer.

286
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,919
Watch out for the...
Gag me with a spoon.

287
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,957
Yeah, head for the door.
Grody to the max.

288
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,759
Ow.

289
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,553
Ow.

290
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,631
I'm really sorry about that...

291
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,949
...Walter. What were you saying?

292
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:55,669
Yes. Tex Richman, the oil baron, is...
Yes, yes, yes.

293
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,751
Oil baron Tex Richman,
the wealthy philanthropist.

294
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,229
You know, he's about to buy
our old Muppet Show theater

295
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,356
and turn it into a Muppet museum.
Isn't that great?

296
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,717
No! I mean...
What Walter's trying to tell you

297
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,634
is that Tex Richman has a secret plan to
tear down the theater and drill for oil.

298
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,756
What?
The only way to save the studio

299
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,190
is to raise ten million dollars.

300
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,397
Ten million dollars? That's impossible.

301
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,834
But...
The only way to raise

302
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,353
that kind of money would be to...

303
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,192
...would be to put on a show.

304
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:30,514
And I haven't seen the old gang
in a long, long time.

305
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,355
I guess people sort of forgot about us.

306
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,635
Hm?

307
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,111
# Is there more I could've said?

308
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:54,195
# Now they're only pictures in my head

309
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,356
# That's why my green is feeling gray

310
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,115
# Sometimes even frogs have rainy days

311
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,077
# Remember when the stage caved in
while you were rocking out?

312
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,760
# Who'd have thought your smorgasbord
would be hard to live without?

313
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,836
# If we could do it all again

314
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,069
# Just another chance to entertain

315
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:38,399
# Would anybody watch or even care?

316
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:44,229
# Or did something break
we can't repair?

317
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:51,395
# Your cannonball trajectory
It always gave me hope

318
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:57,390
# They may have been unbearable
but I still loved your jokes

319
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,036
# Is there more I could've said?

320
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,439
# Now they're only pictures in my head

321
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:17,675
I didn't do it. I've been framed!
Ahh. Wocka wocka!

322
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,917
Gonzo the Great
will ride this baby again!

323
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:26,870
Muah!

324
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:32,708
This legato tune is posolutely,
most transparently bringing me down.

325
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,316
For sure.
One, two, and a half...

326
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,998
# Can we do it all again?

327
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,071
# Make'em laugh like we did then

328
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,789
# We can harmonize for one more song

329
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,716
# But I'm standing here instead

330
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:11,353
# Now they're only pictures in my head #

331
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,910
Well, it sounds like you guys aren't
getting back together anytime soon.

332
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:15,796
Mmm...

333
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,520
This is going to be
a really short movie.

334
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:22,673
But, Kermit, you have to try.

335
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,116
I... The Muppets are amazing.

336
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,835
You give people the greatest gift
that can ever be given.

337
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,560
Children?
No, the other gift.

338
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,756
Ice cream?
No, no. After that.

339
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,391
Laughter?
Yes!

340
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,199
The third greatest gift ever!

341
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,750
Kermit, your fans never left you,
the world hasn't forgotten.

342
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,349
All you need to do is show'em again!

343
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,919
Hmm.

344
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,838
I don't think so, guys.

345
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,595
Don't you see, Kermit?

346
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,274
It's time to play the music.

347
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,550
# It's time to light the lights

348
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,393
# It's time to meet the Muppets... #

349
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,511
Please, Kermit.

350
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,911
You're my hero.

351
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,791
You're on my watch.

352
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,192
Well, I... I guess...

353
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,154
...we could try.

354
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,231
We?
Well, yeah, listen.

355
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,595
If I'm gonna do this,
I'm gonna need some moral support.

356
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:40,673
Well, that's perfect.
We're experts at moral support.

357
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,717
Yeah!
Good. I guess if we're gonna go,

358
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,791
we better get going.
We got a lot of people to find.

359
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,997
Oh, great! But wait,
how do we find'em?

360
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,310
Didn't you see our first movie?

361
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,792
We drive.

362
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:09,556
So where do we go first?
I shall take the liberty

363
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,035
of using my modem to locate the Muppets.

364
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,713
OK.
Great.

365
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,271
Oh, stop it!

366
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,000
In the name of all
that's sacred, let it end!

367
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:23,438
R-E-N-O. That spells "Reno."

368
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,109
You have reached your destination.
My guidance ends here.

369
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,468
Well, I guess
this is the place.

370
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,509
Good evening, folks,
and welcome to Pechoolo Casino!

371
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,636
# Why are there such great deals

372
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,837
# On our hotel rooms?

373
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,072
# Free parking for cars

374
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:57,711
# Not RVs
# Not RVs

375
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:01,589
# Our wedding chapel is 24 hours

376
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,196
# No marriage certificate is needed
# No marriage certificate is needed

377
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,352
# We're glad you found it

378
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:11,956
# Pechoolo Casino

379
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:18,309
# The owners, the Moopets and me #

380
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,469
Cha-cha-cha!

381
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,593
Thank you, thank you.
We'll be back in six minutes.

382
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,749
Hmm.

383
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,160
Hi-ho, Fozzie.
Hi-ho, Kermit.

384
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,118
Kermit?
What are you doing here?

385
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:37,556
Well, I... I just want to tell you
that was a great show.

386
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,797
It was... very informative.

387
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,632
I do my best to
keep it fresh each night.

388
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,552
Oh, yeah.
Oh, I'm Fozzie, by the way.

389
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,553
Oh, I'm sorry.
This is Gary and Mary.

390
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,837
And this here is Walter.
He's a personal friend.

391
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,833
Yeah.
So I said, "What are you looking at?"

392
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,310
So I punched him in the face! I mean...

393
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,233
Let's talk in my dressing room.
Sure.

394
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,551
OK.
Here we are.

395
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,034
Make yourselves at home.

396
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,629
Wow.

397
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,714
This is not quite what I expected,

398
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:15,515
based on your Christmas cards.
Oh, yeah. About that...

399
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,672
Oh, but it's nice, and... and airy.

400
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,796
Maybe we should give them some space.

401
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,837
I know, but I wanna hear
what they're gonna say. OK.

402
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,150
Sixty-four shows nightly
can get pretty grueling.

403
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,869
Fozzie, an evil oil baron wants
to tear down our old Muppet studio.

404
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,474
What? Oh, no!

405
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,518
I mean, that's a shame.

406
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,353
Step out of the vehicle!

407
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,317
Hey, Fozzie...

408
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,754
I'm sorry I haven't
been in touch more.

409
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:47,072
It's fine, Kermit. Look at me!
Living the dream!

410
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,355
Uh-oh.

411
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,239
Oh, no! Not this again!

412
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,039
Quick, save the cushions!
The cushions?

413
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,878
I'm sorry, Fozzie.

414
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,156
If I'd known you were here
in this place...

415
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,357
That's all right, Kermit.
It's not your fault.

416
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:09,030
We had a good run.
Yeah.

417
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,236
Yeah, it's just that...

418
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:16,275
Well, we haven't seen each other
in a really long time, and I...

419
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,113
I just thought maybe we could raise
the money to buy the theater back

420
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,517
if we all got together
and put on one last show.

421
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:26,389
A show? But I've spent years
building a solo career.

422
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,791
I have a whole new show-biz
family that loves me.

423
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,709
Fozzie! What the heck
are you doing, hibernating?

424
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,070
Next show starts in 30 seconds.

425
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:42,110
We hired you, and we can fire you,
so get your butt in here now!

426
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,679
They terrify me. Let's go.
Let's go.

427
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,838
Watch out for the forklift, Fozzie.
Oh, thanks.

428
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,355
Wow! Gonzo's doing really well!

429
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,589
According to 80's Robot,

430
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,194
he's the richest plumbing magnate
in the Rust Belt.

431
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:03,359
You! Order 28,000 tons of
plumber's putty from Beijing.

432
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,432
Right away, sir.
And, you, send the 28,000 tons

433
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,238
of Silly Putty back to Beijing.

434
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,913
You bet.
Oh, and you?

435
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,429
A memo to the waterless
toilet department.

436
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,194
I don't care about the mess,
just keep trying.

437
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,638
Hi, Gonzo.
Kermit? Fozzie? This is a surprise.

438
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,037
We need to speak to you.
All right. Have a seat.

439
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,151
Ah. Thank you!

440
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,757
I think I'll stand.
No, really, you should try one! Comfy.

441
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,353
It's our executive line of used toilets.

442
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,512
Anyway, I'm very busy.
I've got 30 seconds. Go.

443
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,158
Uh... Gonzo, I'm not quite
sure how to say this, but...

444
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,952
Don't forget to mention
the evil oil baron.

445
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,509
Yes, Fozzie, I was about to.
Just give me a moment, OK?

446
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,671
Gonzo, it would appear...

447
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,353
Remember, evil oil baron.

448
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,034
Fozzie, I'm going
to get to that. Please!

449
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,236
As I was trying to say...
Evil oil baron.

450
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,517
OK, time's up. Thank you, guys.

451
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:01,470
Gonzo, we're trying to get the
old gang back together again.

452
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,428
We really need you.
My answer is no. Good day!

453
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,675
Come on, guys. We should go.

454
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:17,792
I just want to say, when I was a kid,
I saw you recite Hamlet

455
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,633
while jumping your motorbike
through a flaming hoop, and...

456
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:24,236
...it made me feel
like I could do anything.

457
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,392
Thank you. Yeah.

458
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:42,509
Good try, Walter.
Hey, guys, up here!

459
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,557
Ya-haa!
Huh?

460
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:48,514
I've been wearing this under
my suit every single day for years!

461
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,073
Look out below!

462
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,793
Whoa, where you going?
You threw me off-balance!

463
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,316
I can't see! Apollo 13!

464
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:05,157
Citizens of Earth,
the Great Gonzo is back.

465
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,716
I pledge never to hold a plunger again!

466
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:15,711
Run! Run! Run for your lives!
Run, run, run!

467
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,998
Run, guys!
Run!

468
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,479
Oh, my gosh, run everybody!

469
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,518
It's gonna be big!
It's gonna be a big one!

470
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,917
Wow! That was an
expensive looking explosion!

471
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,514
I can't believe we
had that in the budget.

472
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,439
So maybe if you
look inside yourself,

473
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,639
the person you should be
most angry at is you.

474
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,835
Is you.

475
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,675
How have you been feeling?
Any more control issues?

476
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,434
In control.

477
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,591
Good.
Psst. Animal!

478
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,911
Excellent.
It's me, Kermit.

479
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,278
Hey, we're having a meeting here, man.
You're being really rude, frog!

480
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,477
Pardon us, please. Animal,
I need to talk to you for a second.

481
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:15,593
We're getting the Muppets back together.
We need you to drum again.

482
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,318
Animal drum?
Yes!

483
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,476
Please, sir.
Drum! Drum, drum!

484
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,790
Drum, drum, drum!
OK, OK.

485
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,040
In control.
Good.

486
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,475
I'm Animal's court-appointed sponsor.

487
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,791
We don't use the "d-r-u-m" word.

488
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,996
It's his trigger word.
His trigger word?

489
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,509
Excuse me, Mr. Black.
I'm so sorry to interrupt,

490
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,750
but it's very important to these guys
that they get their drummer...

491
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,709
Gary!

492
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,518
It's my trigger word, too.

493
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:45,434
Jack, we talked about this on Tuesday.

494
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,830
Tuesday's another one
of my trigger words!

495
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,073
Oh, I don't think so!

496
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,154
Sorry.

497
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,072
Let's go, Animal.
Bye-bye!

498
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:58,312
Animal, heel.
Go, Animal! Be free, man!

499
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:02,149
But remember! No drumming!

500
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,074
Mr. Kermit, may I suggest
we save time and pick up

501
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,390
the rest of the Muppets using a montage?

502
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,676
Great idea, 80's Robot.

503
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,392
We greatly appreciate
your financial support.

504
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,598
Eighty-seven point three
miles to go. Eighty-seven point two...

505
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,478
80's Robot,
do you have to do that?

506
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,312
...the secrets of the universe...

507
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,874
I guess we're in.

508
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:35,671
Welcome to this week's edition
of "Everything Stinks."

509
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,190
Whoa!

510
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,679
Bye, Lisa.
Off to the TED Conference.

511
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,114
Three, two, one.

512
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,713
Think we should've rented a bigger car?

513
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:54,396
Hey, wait for me!
I wanna help save the studio!

514
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:58,872
I wanna go with you! Oh, not again.

515
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:02,152
Wow. I can't believe
we're all back together.

516
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,878
Even all you guys
who weren't in the montage!

517
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,231
Yeah, how come you
didn't use me in the montage?

518
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,391
I thought my story
was pretty interesting.

519
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:13,269
Rowlf? Wanna get back together?

520
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,555
OK.
Good.

521
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,671
Classic.

522
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,592
Anyhow, looks like we got everybody,

523
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,910
so we can plan our telethon
and raise that ten million dollars.

524
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,798
Well, not everybody.
No, I think everybody's here.

525
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,188
Where's...?
All good!

526
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,634
Miss...
All done here!

527
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,233
Piggy?

528
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,113
Kermit, we're going
to get Miss Piggy, right?

529
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,470
OK, OK, OK, you're right.
We'll go get Piggy!

530
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:37,475
My Minitel tells me
she is in Paris, France.

531
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,312
Oh! Well, then we drive to France.

532
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:43,393
You can't drive to France, Walter.
Yeah. It's way too far.

533
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,312
Then maybe we should travel by map!

534
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,710
Good idea, Fozzie.
Yeah!

535
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,919
To Paris!

536
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,991
Paris! Paris!

537
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,759
Look at these ceilings!

538
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,473
Yeah. They must
be very tall here.

539
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:34,359
Yeah, very nice.

540
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:38,593
Uh... Hi there. Excuse me.

541
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:43,875
Miss? Pardon me, ma'am?

542
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,759
Hi there! We're here to see
Miss Piggy, and it's urgent.

543
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,831
Urgent! Urgent!

544
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,877
Is it urgent?
Very. Yes.

545
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:55,511
Let's have a look then, shall we?
She has an opening in...

546
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,434
...early September.
Early September?

547
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,158
That's like six months from now!

548
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:04,232
That's nothing. Once I waited
a whole year for September.

549
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,075
She is the plus-size editor.
She's a huge deal and extremely busy.

550
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,958
You can't just pop in
without an appointment.

551
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,395
OK, then.
Thank you.

552
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,198
All right.
Mean lady.

553
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,920
Close the door on your way out.
Thanks a lot.

554
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,950
She wasn't very nice.
Yeah.

555
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:25,113
Guys! Muppet Man!

556
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,590
Yeah!
That could work!

557
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,313
Hello.

558
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,074
I have an appointment.

559
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,876
Oh, OK.

560
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,433
Um...

561
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,953
Will you wait here a moment?

562
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,759
Decisions, decisions.

563
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,919
Eeny, meeny, miny, mo. I choose you.

564
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,549
Mademoiselle Cochonnet?

565
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,479
Can't you see I'm busy?
Of course.

566
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,036
There's a... man here to see you.

567
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,589
He does have an appointment.

568
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,830
An appointment? That's weird.

569
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,718
Well, why didn't you say so?
Send him in!

570
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,029
Right away. Sorry.

571
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,200
Ahahaha.
Remember, left foot, right foot.

572
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,349
Hello.

573
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,999
Whoa.

574
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,952
What the...?
Sorry.

575
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,593
That looked expensive.

576
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:42,552
You look familiar.
So do you!

577
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,352
Please, have a seat.

578
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,159
Yes, we're going to have a seat now.

579
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,073
No, no, no, don't sit down!
Oh, sorry! Whoa!

580
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,036
Uh-oh.

581
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:56,557
Message to head. Left leg in trouble!
Going down. Left leg going down!

582
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,675
What?

583
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:01,955
Ohh!

584
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,315
I can't believe I fell for Muppet Man.

585
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,835
You guys OK?
Is anyone hurt?

586
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,715
Kermit?

587
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,559
Hello, Piggy.
Kermie!

588
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,599
Oh, Kermie, Kermie, Kermie, Kermie,
Kermie, Kermie, Kermie, Kermie, Kermie!

589
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,069
Mm, mm, mm. Kissy-kissy.
Mm, mm, mm!

590
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:25,870
Wait! What am I doing?
I promised myself I'd never go back!

591
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:30,750
I am woman! I am strong!
You must leave at once!

592
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,594
OK.
No, no, wait, wait!

593
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,911
Miss Piggy!
The Muppet Studios are in danger.

594
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:41,993
In danger? Our studios? Kermit!

595
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:46,631
It's true, Piggy. And we need
to do The Muppet Show again.

596
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,835
We need you.

597
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,835
Oh.

598
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:55,999
Before I decide anything,
I need to talk with you, frog.

599
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,198
Alone.

600
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:13,075
Piggy? Last time we were together,
I said some things I regret.

601
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:16,596
No. No, Kermit.
You were just being honest.

602
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,955
You never intended to marry me.

603
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,951
Not even after I built us a house

604
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,793
where we could raise tadpoles
and grow old together.

605
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:27,919
Well, who do you think's been looking
after that house all these years, huh?

606
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:31,311
Piggy, why do you have to always
be so overdramatic about things?

607
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,710
You know, it leaves me no choice
but to do things that hurt you.

608
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:37,236
I am who I am. Why can't
you accept that about me?

609
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,197
Look, this is not about you and me.

610
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,918
It's never about you and me, is it?

611
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,878
It's always we. We this, we that.

612
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:48,352
"We" need you. You can't even say,
"I need you," can you?

613
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,238
Piggy...

614
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,192
I'm sorry, Kermit,
but I have a life here.

615
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:58,319
A life I've made for myself.

616
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,315
Piggy!

617
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:05,674
Just remember, Kermit,
I cannot be replaced.

618
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,594
Kermit? What happened?
Where's Miss Piggy?

619
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,069
She's not coming, Fozzie.

620
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,754
But, Kermit, we always worked together.

621
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,951
We can't do this without Miss Piggy.

622
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,076
No one will give us a show without her.

623
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,992
We'll be fine, Fozzie.

624
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,829
We'll be fine.

625
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,752
We just...

626
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,514
We'll just have to
come up with something else.

627
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,470
Kermie.

628
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,391
OK, I've got an idea.
We need a pig that can sing.

629
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,836
But, Kermit, who could
possibly replace Miss Piggy?

630
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,591
Hey, what's everybody so quiet about,
huh?

631
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:15,759
Well, she's sorta like Miss Piggy.
Come on, everybody.

632
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:19,595
Let's go pitch our telethon
and get the Muppets back on TV, OK?

633
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,190
No.
No.

634
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,917
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, that's wonderful!

635
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,399
That means no.

636
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,915
Come on, guys.
Awkward.

637
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,719
Listen, Kermit, I like you.

638
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,711
I remember you guys
from when I was a kid.

639
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,713
So I'm gonna shoot straight.

640
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,713
You guys aren't famous anymore.

641
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,558
I wish she'd shot a little more curvy.

642
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:52,917
Take a look at this diagram
the research department drew up.

643
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:56,755
This circle represents
everything that's currently popular.

644
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,594
And this tiny speck is you guys.

645
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,990
So the answer's no.
It's not gonna happen.

646
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,958
Take a look at the shows that
are popular now. Punch Teacher.

647
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:11,114
Oh! I love that show.
It's time to punch teacher!

648
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,916
Finish him!
It's my favorite.

649
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,753
I just thought
I could make a difference.

650
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:21,198
I'm sorry, but in this market, you guys
are no longer relevant. Have a good day.

651
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,357
Before I go,
I'd just like to say something.

652
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,717
I think kids are smarter and better
than all this junk, and if you...

653
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,717
Veronica, bad news. Punch Teacher
has stopped production.

654
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,632
It's being sued by the
Teachers Society of America.

655
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,918
What's their problem?
No idea. I just found out.

656
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,548
What are we supposed to do
with that 120-minute black hole

657
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,598
in the schedule coming up in two days?

658
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,034
OK, Muppets.
You've got yourselves a show.

659
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,435
All right!
Oh, yes!

660
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,950
Thank you so much. You will not
be sorry, I promise, I promise!

661
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:10,159
OK, enough! One, no more going nuts
in my office. These are new carpets.

662
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:13,392
Yes, ma'am.
And two, you need a celebrity host.

663
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:16,757
OK. Whatever, whatever.
Come on, guys, let's go. Yeah!

664
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,034
Let me wipe that.
You've missed a spot.

665
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,838
I don't see it.
Just a little lower!

666
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,752
Oh, I am so sorry. Did I get you...
Yes.

667
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:31,118
Well, gentlemen. It appears
we have some competition

668
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,316
on the Muppet property.

669
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:36,711
The Economist says they've
gotten back together again.

670
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,838
The Muppets got back together?
Remember?

671
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,753
# Together again
Gee, it's good to be... #

672
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:46,708
Gentlemen, please!
No singing in my office!

673
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,359
Yes, sir.
But, of course, it was all his fault.

674
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,670
Mostly his fault.
No matter.

675
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:55,317
Point is, that studio
and that oil belong to me.

676
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,152
Yeah, those Muppets are gonna be

677
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,675
running home with
their tails between their legs.

678
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:02,991
Some of'em literally.
Because those ones have tails.

679
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:06,948
Maniacal laugh, maniacal laugh.

680
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,838
That's a maniacal laugh moment.

681
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,993
OK, this is it. 80's Robot,
let's park around back.

682
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,308
It's The Muppet Show,

683
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:39,948
with our special guest star,
Mr. Bob Hope!

684
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:43,638
Time once again
for Veterinarian's Hospital,

685
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,189
the continuing story of...

686
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:49,591
And now, Pigs in Space!

687
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:53,150
Gary. Can you believe it?

688
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:58,951
The Muppet theater.
Yeah.

689
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,995
Welcome back, everyone.
Thanks.

690
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,668
Well, I know the old place is
not quite at its best right now.

691
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:09,479
Yeah! Who cancelled
the maid service?

692
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,835
But don't worry. We'll be fine.

693
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:15,874
Kermit, there's no way we can
rehearse with the place like this.

694
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:18,474
Wait. Kermit, don't say another word.

695
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:22,474
Mary, Walter and I, well, we would be
happy to help you rebuild the theater.

696
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,238
Honestly, it would be an honor
for all three of us.

697
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,597
So would.
OK. Well, let's clean this place up!

698
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,273
Yeah!

699
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:37,831
This is boring.
But don't you guys remember?

700
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,356
You're the Muppets!
You do this to music!

701
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:42,953
Well, all right!

702
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:55,470
Hey, Animal!
Yeah?

703
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:56,709
Look what I found!

704
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,351
Beauregard!
Scooter! Good to see you!

705
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:20,715
Where's everybody been?

706
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,676
Celebrity... celebrity!

707
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:27,991
Hello! Yes. Could I speak
with President Carter, please?

708
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:31,590
He moved? Well, you don't happen to have
a number where I could reach... Hello?

709
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,478
Walter, I thought we were gonna
clean the balcony.

710
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,790
Doing a great job, pal.
You're doing a great job.

711
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,911
Wocka wocka.
Hey, guys!

712
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:40,389
Look at these old photos I just found.

713
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,595
Oooh.

714
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:44,360
Can you believe that 80's
haircut I used to have?

715
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,715
I looked totally ridiculous!

716
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,190
Yes, it's Kermit. The frog.

717
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,590
Could you come to our celebrity
telethon this weekend?

718
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,398
Sure. Sure, I understand.

719
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:10,833
Hey, shut the door!
What is that?

720
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,475
Say hello to the little friend.

721
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,469
There goes dinner.

722
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:44,154
Wow! Great job, everybody!

723
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,749
Oh, hey, Kermit.
Listen, have a great night,

724
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:49,753
and I just want you to know,
Walter and I are really good sewers,

725
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,150
so we'll have those costumes
ready for you in no time.

726
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:55,118
Good. You two have a great night.
OK. Thank you!

727
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,589
Bye.
Kermit?

728
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,955
Gary, I was kind of hoping
that we could go to the beach tomorrow

729
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:02,395
or see the Hollywood Sign.
We'll have plenty of time

730
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,357
to do that stuff. It's just, right now,

731
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:08,069
I don't wanna leave Walter.
You know, he needs me.

732
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:11,676
I don't know, sweetheart,
he seems pretty happy.

733
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,554
Like that.
Oh, OK.

734
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,312
Now you.

735
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:18,875
Yeah, that's it!
Yeah, yeah, good job!

736
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:22,635
Well, just one more day, OK?
And then I'm all yours.

737
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,792
Tell you what. Why don't you get
a head start on sightseeing tomorrow,

738
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:28,633
and then I'll be waiting
for you when you get back.

739
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,395
OK. Just...
don't forget about me.

740
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:33,788
Never.

741
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,678
Well, we're still on
for dinner Friday, right?

742
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:37,353
Yeah, of course.

743
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:38,873
Oh, Walter!
Oh, yes, Kermit.

744
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:40,911
Hey, listen, Walter,
I just wanna tell you

745
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:43,230
that none of this would have happened
without you, so thank you.

746
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:46,119
Oh, well...
And welcome aboard.

747
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,430
Night, everybody. Just sleep
anywhere you can find a spot.

748
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:51,319
"Welcome aboard"?

749
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,116
Hey, Kermit. You awake?

750
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,436
Yep.
What's the weather

751
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:15,798
supposed to be like tonight?
I don't know. Why?

752
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,997
I just don't want it to rain
through the hole in the ceiling.

753
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,878
Stars sure are pretty, though.

754
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,549
We're gonna be OK, right?
We haven't done this in a long time,

755
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:32,111
and I really don't
wanna go back to Reno.

756
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:34,111
Don't worry, Fozzie. We'll be fine.

757
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:36,999
Look how we cleaned this place
up today, you know?

758
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:39,833
Same old team, all pulling together.

759
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,073
I guess you're right.
Night-night, Kermit.

760
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,629
Good night, Fozzie.

761
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:55,359
OK, gather round, troops! Everybody,
time to get this rehearsal going.

762
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,636
Scooter, is everybody here?
Almost everyone, chief.

763
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:00,792
Yeah...
Hey, anybody got any kerosene?

764
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,037
I wanna take these old pig
dresses out back and burn'em.

765
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:07,192
Hold it right there, sausage snout!

766
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,993
Piggy?
Huh?

767
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,748
Well, look what the cat dragged in.

768
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,672
Come on. Keep it up, Maurice.

769
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:24,233
Sorry, Miss Piggy, but you've
been replaced... permanently.

770
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:27,671
Oh, yeah?
Yeah!

771
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:31,913
I don't think so... sister?

772
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:36,039
Who you calling sister, sister?

773
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,196
Oh, look, an omelet station!
Oh, where?

774
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,078
Hiya!

775
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:44,677
There's only one Miss Piggy,
and she is moi.

776
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:49,675
Yeah, well, you ain't seen
the last of me! I'll be back!

777
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:51,711
Yeah, yeah. Heard of mouthwash?

778
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,275
Welcome back, Miss Piggy.

779
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:56,954
All right, all right, don't crowd me!

780
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,190
Wow, she sure hasn't changed.

781
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:03,151
Piggy? You came back.

782
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:06,949
I'm not here for you, Kermit.
I'm here for them.

783
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:11,115
And, besides,
when this show's done,

784
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:14,869
I'm catching the next plane
back to my life in Paris.

785
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:18,828
OK, Piggy, OK. Places for the
opening number, everybody!

786
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,518
Oh, good morning, Veronica.

787
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:27,117
Morning, Frog.
OK, everybody, take it from the top.

788
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,748
Oooh!

789
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,951
You missed your cue.
I know!

790
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,430
There's kind of
a rhythm to this, you know?

791
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:41,189
Uh... Oh, and if you like that one,
what's the bear capital of the world?

792
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:42,952
Mos-cow!

793
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:49,828
Ha.

794
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:53,796
# It's time to play the music

795
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:55,951
# It's time to light the lights
Two, three, four.

796
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,917
# It's time to put on makeup

797
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:00,036
# It's time to dress up right #

798
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,800
Hey guys, stop. Cut, cut, cut,
cut, cut. What's the problem?

799
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:06,714
We can't keep time without
the drums, man! We need drums!

800
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:10,270
Sorry, Animal.
No drums! No drums!

801
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:13,955
Jack Black said no drums!
Animal, heel! Sit!

802
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,589
Who's next? Oh.
In control.

803
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:21,471
Hey, Walter?
Oh. Yes, Kermit?

804
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:22,954
You think you might
wanna help us out here?

805
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:25,315
Maybe do something in the show?

806
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:28,074
Kermit, you know,
you've been so nice to me,

807
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:33,268
but I have to face the facts.
See, the Muppets are so talented...

808
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:36,358
Hey, guys, check it out! Fart shoes!

809
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,070
Patent pending!
And...

810
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:42,748
...I don't have any talent at all.

811
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:47,118
The truth is...
I can't perform with you guys.

812
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:50,113
I feel like a phony just being here.

813
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:52,999
Walter, just because you haven't
found your talent yet,

814
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:56,994
doesn't mean you don't have one.
If you look inside yourself,

815
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:59,958
I'm sure you'll find something
that you're really good at.

816
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:04,837
OK, Kermit. I'll try.

817
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,117
Take my picture!

818
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:20,430
Welcome.
How many in your party? Two?

819
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:23,398
Uh... No, just the one.

820
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:26,313
All right, party of one, follow me.

821
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:33,434
# I look around, and once
again I'm on my own

822
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:37,275
# My man ain't here
He's gone and done me wrong

823
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:40,432
# No one's gonna stop this girl
from having fun

824
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:43,876
# I throw my hands up high
and have a party for one

825
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:47,874
# I'm having a me party
A party by myself

826
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:51,555
# A me party
I don't need nobody else

827
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:55,599
# A me party
I'm the first and last to show

828
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:59,719
# There's no one at this party
that I don't already know

829
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:03,555
# I'm not gonna sit around
by myself and wait for you

830
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:06,598
# Haven't you heard?
One is the new two

831
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:10,118
# I'm gonna make a scene
I'm gonna make a fuss

832
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:14,717
# Tonight I'm gonna celebrate
with just the one of us

833
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,550
# I'm having a me party

834
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:19,676
# Haven't I seen me here before?

835
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:21,393
# A me party

836
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:23,471
# I'm the last one on the dance floor

837
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:26,950
# Me party
# A party just for moi

838
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:30,635
# Me party
# It's a solo Mardi Gras

839
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:34,475
# I'm having a me party
I'm such good company

840
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:38,155
# A me party
# I saved the last dance for me

841
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:47,393
# What happens at a me party
stays at a me party #

842
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:51,599
Excuse me, miss, are you
expecting anyone else?

843
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:54,228
Oh... no.

844
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,709
No, it's just me. Party of one.

845
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,638
Order up!

846
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:03,351
OK, cue 17 is Fozzie's intro.
Hey, Scooter? What's left?

847
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,715
Oh, uh, it's you, chief!

848
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:09,429
Hm?
Your duet. With Piggy.

849
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:15,313
Miss Piggy?
Hm?

850
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:17,351
We're all out front practicing our acts

851
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:20,028
and seems that everybody expects
you and I to do a duet, so...

852
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:23,875
Oh, that's so lovely,
but I'm afraid I can't.

853
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:28,591
No, no, you see, I'm already doing
a duet with my new dance partner.

854
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,552
Hola.

855
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,551
OK, come on, rehearsing,
let's go. We gotta break it up.

856
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:35,029
Excuse us.
'Scuse us.

857
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,952
Let's try that lift again, shall we?

858
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:39,680
The lift again.
OK, on my count this time, OK?

859
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:42,553
In three, two... Wait for me!

860
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:43,789
Good grief.

861
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:46,633
Kermit! There you are. I've been
looking for you everywhere!

862
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:48,193
So nice to see you, Veronica.

863
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:50,271
Who's hosting?
Did you find a celebrity?

864
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:54,319
Yeah, well, I've wanted to talk to you
about that, you see, because...

865
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:58,672
Well, actually, I'm kind of a celebrity.

866
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,159
You?

867
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,117
No. Kermit, listen.

868
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:06,034
I will not air the show unless
you find a real celebrity host.

869
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,117
I will rerun Benson if I have to.

870
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:11,198
Yeah, you see, the thing is, Veronica,

871
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:14,193
that's kind of impossible
because the show's in 12 hours!

872
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:15,839
Twelve hours!

873
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:20,318
I might as well just go and ask Tex
Richman to give us the studio back!

874
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:27,278
And the Muppets are like a big family.
Well... And for us,

875
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:32,833
that theater is... is like our home.
Which is why, in conclusion...

876
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:36,990
...we humbly ask that you
give us back our studio.

877
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:42,317
It would certainly mean a lot to us.

878
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:44,351
Hmmm.

879
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:48,232
Well, Mr. The Frog, let me see.

880
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:21,994
Correct!

881
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:34,429
The answer is no.

882
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:38,478
Well, you could've just said that.

883
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,517
Contract.
Contract.

884
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:41,715
Contract.

885
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:47,159
Nicely done, sir.
You see, Muppets,

886
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:49,231
according to this contract,

887
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:53,188
it's not just this studio
you lose the rights to tonight,

888
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:55,351
it's the Muppet name itself.
What?

889
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:59,115
And all characters
under the Muppet name.

890
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:02,352
Wait a second. What possible use
could you have for our names?

891
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:12,150
Told ya I'd be back.

892
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:14,396
Well, now I am...

893
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:17,194
...back.

894
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:22,195
And I see you've met Mr. Richman,
our new business partner.

895
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:28,549
The Moopets are a hard, cynical act
for a hard, cynical world.

896
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:34,989
Hey, Fozzie! I want you
to meet a friend of mine.

897
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:41,149
Wocka wocka.
You're relics, Muppets!

898
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:44,596
The world has moved on,
and no one cares about

899
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:49,709
your goody-goody, hippy-dippy,
Julie Andrews and Dom DeLuise hostin',

900
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:53,509
singin'-and-dancin' act anymore!
You're dead!

901
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:56,911
And I just come to bury you.

902
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:01,389
Now, get out of my office.

903
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:03,073
What?
What is that supposed to mean?

904
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:04,639
You said you were gonna talk to the man!

905
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:09,078
Guys! OK, so maybe
Kermit signed away the theater

906
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:12,949
and the Muppet name, but as long
as we have a celebrity host,

907
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:16,908
we can still pull off a heart-warming,
last-minute triumph, right, Kermit?

908
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:21,795
Well, actually I
don't see how we can, Fozzie.

909
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:23,154
Huh?
What?

910
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:24,958
Guys, the show's in six hours,

911
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:29,750
and we're barely rehearsed,
and, well, I...

912
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,751
I couldn't get us a celebrity host.

913
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,990
Oh, no!
What?

914
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:39,595
I'm afraid Tex Richman's right.
The world's moved on.

915
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,716
I'm sorry I dragged you guys
into this mess.

916
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:44,751
Kermit?

917
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:52,073
All right, listen up, you freaks!

918
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:54,834
I didn't come 5,000 miles
to not be on TV.

919
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:59,630
All we need is one stinkin' celebrity,
and by any means necessary.

920
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:04,828
Now, the frog's gone.
We're doing things my way from now on.

921
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,479
Let's move!

922
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:11,235
Hey!
Hi.

923
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:14,432
How was your day?
Oh, it was great.

924
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:17,751
I went to Guinness Book
of World Records... alone.

925
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:20,275
Then Ripley's Believe It or Not... solo.

926
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:22,874
And then I ate lunch unaccompanied,

927
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:26,231
and then I walked back here...
independently.

928
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,153
Listen, I got you these.

929
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:32,551
You know, to make up for the
other ones. The broken ones.

930
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:35,312
Thanks, sweetie.

931
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:38,433
Listen, Gary.

932
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:41,797
I was just wondering what
the plan was for dinner tonight.

933
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:43,393
Oh, I don't care.
What do you feel like?

934
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:48,279
OK. That's fine.

935
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:51,677
That's just fine.
That's... that's perfect.

936
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:55,236
I'm going to go for a walk.

937
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,749
Individually.

938
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:08,352
Walter, hey.
Gary.

939
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:11,637
Oh, where have you been? I need you
to help me figure out a talent.

940
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:13,313
A talent for what?

941
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:17,473
For the show. Kermit asked me
to do an act in the show.

942
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:20,359
I... I could be a Muppet.

943
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:24,353
Wow. Wow, Walter, that's amazing.

944
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:27,273
Yeah, but I need to
figure out if I have a talent.

945
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,749
Well, you know what?
I'm sure you'll think of something,

946
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:32,434
but right now I actually...
I need your help.

947
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:35,672
I'm starting to get the feeling that
Mary's upset with me about something,

948
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:39,276
and I don't know what, and I was hoping
maybe you would talk to her for me.

949
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:40,555
Gary, I'd love to help you out,

950
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:43,757
but I can't leave the theater now.
This is important.

951
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:46,957
Well, hold on a second.
I mean, my life is important, too.

952
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:49,435
Yeah, but the whole reason we came here
was to see the Muppets.

953
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:51,955
No, it wasn't!
The whole reason we came here

954
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:54,429
was to take a vacation where
I took Mary out to a fancy dinner

955
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:56,272
because it's our tenth
anniversary, and then...

956
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,309
Walter, what day is today?
Friday.

957
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:04,392
Yeah. Yeah, that's it.

958
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:08,109
This is bad.
Walter, this is really bad. I have to...

959
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:10,999
Mary? Mary!
Wait.

960
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:14,357
Gary, I need you.

961
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:31,198
OK, is everybody ready?

962
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:34,670
Commence Operation
Celebri-nap. Masks on!

963
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:37,070
Masks on!
Except for moi.

964
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:38,753
Nothing covers this beautiful face.

965
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:43,317
No maskin'?
No maskin'.

966
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,911
Check the door on Stage 28.

967
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:48,514
I'm going over there now.
She's done in makeup...

968
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:01,352
I told you, I'm not done
putting on my balls!

969
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:07,273
Oh, hey, Animal.

970
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:09,595
What are you doin' here?

971
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:13,878
Acting. Natural.

972
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:15,229
Now!

973
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:17,475
Whoa!

974
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:21,392
Hiya!

975
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:36,994
Hiya!

976
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:46,074
Mary, surprise! I figured out
why you're mad... at me.

977
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:57,837
Gary, I've gone home.

978
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:01,589
I love you, but you need
to decide, are you a man

979
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:03,671
or a Muppet?

980
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:19,792
# I reflect on my reflection

981
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:23,794
# And I ask myself the question

982
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:29,796
# What's the right direction to go?

983
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:33,595
# I don't know

984
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:38,390
# Am I a man

985
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:43,111
# Or am I a Muppet?
# Am I a Muppet?

986
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:46,397
# If I'm a Muppet
Then I'm a very manly Muppet

987
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:50,109
# Very manly Muppet
# Am I a Muppet?

988
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:53,431
# Muppet
# Or am I a man?

989
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:56,029
# Am I a man?

990
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:59,670
# If I'm a man that makes
me a Muppet of a man

991
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:02,195
# A Muppet of a man

992
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:09,717
# I look into these eyes

993
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:13,077
# And I don't recognize

994
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:17,637
# The one I see inside

995
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:23,434
# It's time for me to decide

996
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:27,639
# Am I a man

997
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:29,637
# Or am I a Muppet?

998
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:32,274
# Am I a Muppet?

999
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:35,750
# If I'm a Muppet
Well, I'm a very manly Muppet

1000
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:39,674
# Very manly Muppet
# Am I a Muppet?

1001
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:42,673
# Muppet
# Or am I a man?

1002
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:44,990
# Am I a man?

1003
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:49,392
# If I'm a man that makes
me a Muppet of a man

1004
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:51,676
# A Muppet of a man

1005
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:54,879
# Here I go again

1006
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:57,918
# I'm always running out of time

1007
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:02,272
# I think I made up my mind

1008
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:06,228
# Now I understand who I am

1009
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:12,271
# I'm a man

1010
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:15,910
# I'm a Muppet

1011
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:24,116
# I'm a Muppet of a man
# I'm a very manly Muppet

1012
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:28,636
# I'm a Muppet-y man

1013
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:43,313
I'm so sorry.

1014
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:45,914
Oh, Gary.
Mary.

1015
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:50,869
# That's what I am #

1016
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:01,192
Kermit. We have our celebrity!

1017
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:04,955
Mr. Jack Black has graciously
agreed to do the telethon!

1018
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:07,554
Oh, my gosh, that's amazing.
Where is he?

1019
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:10,632
In the trunk.
Get me outta here!

1020
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,712
You kidnapped Jack Black?
That's illegal!

1021
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:18,431
But, Kermit, what's more illegal,
briefly inconveniencing Jack Black,

1022
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:23,116
or destroying the Muppets?
Kidnapping Jack Black, Fozzie!

1023
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:26,556
Kermit, listen. Whatever
I may think of you right now,

1024
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:29,393
these guys are counting on you.
You inspire them.

1025
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:32,279
What, to kidnap people?
To work together.

1026
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:36,274
To kidnap people?
Mr. The Frog, we all agreed

1027
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:39,113
a celebrity is not a people.

1028
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:42,636
And now that we have a celebrity,
the show's back on.

1029
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:46,395
Come on, Kermit.
Don't let these guys down now.

1030
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:53,119
All right. Well, what are you
guys still doing here, huh?

1031
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:54,719
It's showtime!
All right!

1032
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:55,915
That's it!

1033
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:01,189
Nicely done, sir. As usual.
En garde.

1034
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:04,558
Ow! Ow.

1035
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:06,950
OK, very nice.

1036
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:09,270
Halt! Point left!

1037
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:12,238
Well done, sir. Thank you.
Thank you so much.

1038
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:15,756
And coming up next on CDE,
The Muppet Telethon.

1039
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:18,309
Kermit and friends host
a celebrity-studded gala,

1040
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:22,155
with special guest, Jack Black.
Oh! He's pretty good.

1041
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:28,388
We're going to phase two.
Yes, Mr. Richman.

1042
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:33,551
So do you think we're
working for the bad guy?

1043
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:40,676
Hurry! The show starts in ten minutes!

1044
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:44,712
Where did you learn to drive?

1045
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:49,956
Hang on, everyone!

1046
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:56,873
Come on, guys. OK, listen up, everybody!
This is it! Five minutes to curtain!

1047
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:59,031
Kermit?
Get ready for the opening number.

1048
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,872
Yes?
I need to talk to you about my act.

1049
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:02,871
Listen, Walter,
I know you're gonna be fine.

1050
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:05,110
In fact, I'm sure you'll be great.
Scooter, who's up first?

1051
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:06,633
Come on, come on, come on!
No...

1052
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:08,153
Fly in the arches!

1053
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:12,394
OK, first we have the opening theme.
Of course. Yeah.

1054
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:14,357
You come out and introduce Fozzie.
Right.

1055
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:17,193
Then we have...
TV executive at six o'clock!

1056
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:20,198
What?
The show is a disaster, Frog!

1057
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:22,430
Veronica...
Where's the audience?

1058
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:25,034
I knew you guys
weren't popular anymore.

1059
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:28,198
I should have trusted that chart.
There's no one here!

1060
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:29,998
What about Hobo Joe?
Who?

1061
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:32,628
Why does everybody
forget about Hobo Joe?

1062
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:34,552
Just a second. Scooter!
Yeah, chief?

1063
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:38,429
Did you hand out all those flyers?
Of course. Every last one!

1064
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:40,989
Don't worry.
We'll think of something!

1065
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:42,479
You better.

1066
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:44,671
Yoo-hoo! You've got audience.

1067
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:47,638
It's me! What am I, invisible?

1068
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:49,995
Jack Black.

1069
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:51,912
Fifteen seconds to curtain, Mr. Black.

1070
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:55,069
Hi!
Ah! Where am I?

1071
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:58,357
Why am I so fancy? What are you doing?
You're ruining my look!

1072
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:00,909
We'll see you out there! Good luck!
Stop cleaning me!

1073
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:05,073
You sure got nice teeth, Jack Black.
Yeah.

1074
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:07,475
We're here!

1075
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:10,108
Start the show!
Ready for some kind of entertainment!

1076
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:12,475
All right, good luck, everyone,
and cue Scooter.

1077
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:15,552
OK, we go live in three, two...

1078
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:22,151
Ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome your host, Kermit the Frog.

1079
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:24,877
It's The Muppet Telethon,

1080
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:29,352
with our very special guest,
Mr. Jack Black! Yay!

1081
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:43,078
# It's time to play the music

1082
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:45,271
# It's time to light the lights

1083
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:49,319
# It's time to meet the Muppets
on The Muppet Show tonight

1084
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:51,630
# It's time to put on makeup

1085
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:53,518
# It's time to dress up right

1086
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:55,796
# It's time to get things started

1087
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,275
# Why don't you get things started?

1088
01:09:58,440 --> 01:09:59,839
I always dreamed we'd be back here.

1089
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,036
Dreams? Those were nightmares!

1090
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:03,792
# It's time to get things started

1091
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:07,157
# On the most sensational
inspirational, celebrational

1092
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:13,589
# Muppetational
This is what we call The Muppet Show #

1093
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:21,351
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to The Muppet Telethon!

1094
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:24,592
We have Muppets standing by
to take your calls.

1095
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:26,478
Yes, we are.
Hi. Hello.

1096
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:28,949
Could I have a large pizza
with ham and...?

1097
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:32,232
Yes, and, boy, do we have
a wonderful show for you,

1098
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:35,358
with our special guest, Mr. Jack Black!

1099
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:40,517
I'm being held captive by these weirdos!

1100
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:43,797
Now you know how we've felt
for the past 40 years!

1101
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:47,236
Somebody, anybody, please call
the police. This is real rope!

1102
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:50,517
Man, this 3-D is incredible!
This is real!

1103
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:53,440
Oh, and by the way, folks, we have
plenty of room here in the audience,

1104
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:57,030
so if you'd like to come down
and see the show live...

1105
01:10:57,200 --> 01:11:00,829
There's no audience in the theater.
Look, it's totally empty.

1106
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,518
Poor Walter.

1107
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:09,039
Maybe we should go back.

1108
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:13,916
No way, Mary.
I've made my choice already.

1109
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:15,872
I just sang a whole song about it.

1110
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:18,469
I wanna stay here with you.

1111
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:21,555
So thank you.

1112
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:31,435
Ladies and gentlemen,
prepare yourselves

1113
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:35,189
for the Great Gonzo's
most amazing feat ever.

1114
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:37,637
Head bowling.
What? No!

1115
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:39,153
I have not signed off on this!

1116
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:41,595
Drumroll, please.

1117
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:47,668
And a one and a two and a three!

1118
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:50,798
Uh-oh. Uh... My fingers got stuck.

1119
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:53,474
All part of the act, folks. Stay tuned.

1120
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:56,956
Please, make this end! Please!

1121
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:58,593
This is great. Call'em.

1122
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:07,916
Hello?

1123
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:11,231
You wanna give us some money?!
Uhhh...

1124
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:14,949
Say yes!
Yes! We will take that money!

1125
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:19,557
Hey, guys, we got us some money!

1126
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:24,794
Oh, yeah, tickets. Here we are.
Tickets. Thank you.

1127
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:28,714
Five dollars to show you your seat.
It's up there somewhere.

1128
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:31,792
Help!
OK, thank you, Gonzo.

1129
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:34,520
Thank you very much. Ladies and
gentlemen, we will see what happens with

1130
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:36,796
head bowling
a little later in the show.

1131
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:41,397
Up next is our furry funny man,
Mr. Fozzie Bear! Yay!

1132
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:44,995
Thank you, thank you, and thank you.

1133
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:47,913
Boy, did I go to
a bad seafood place last night.

1134
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:52,039
The catch of the day was salmonella.
Wocka wocka!

1135
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:55,237
OK.
Ah! That joke's like 50 years old!

1136
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:58,192
So how'bout
those shopping centers?

1137
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:00,794
You seen one,
you seen a mall! Take it.

1138
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:02,871
Make it stop!

1139
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:09,840
Wocka wocka wocka wocka!
Make it stop! No!

1140
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,310
We're not a team! I'm not with him!
What is happening?

1141
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:16,517
People are actually watching this?

1142
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:20,116
Deadly! Bring the car!

1143
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:22,159
What am I gonna do?

1144
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:23,435
What am I gonna do?

1145
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:26,273
Walter? Sixty seconds
till you're on, Walter.

1146
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:28,237
You ready?

1147
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:31,437
No. Yes, yes, yes...

1148
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:34,111
Whoopi Goldberg?

1149
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:36,953
Selena Gomez? And... hi there.

1150
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:40,952
Yeah, look, somebody said there
might be a career opportunity here,

1151
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:43,509
something about saving a theater.
Yes, yes, of course.

1152
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:46,274
I don't really know who you guys are.
My agent just told me to show up.

1153
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:47,708
That's great.
Are you one of the

1154
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:49,074
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles?

1155
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:51,993
Yes, I am, and let me
show you how you can help.

1156
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:55,630
And don't worry. It's just your
one shot to go on live TV

1157
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:57,916
before millions of people
to prove you have what it takes

1158
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:00,793
to become one of the Muppets.
Good luck.

1159
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:07,200
Up next, folks, I am proud
to present a brand-new act

1160
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:10,158
to the show. Introducing Walter.

1161
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:21,879
That's not good.

1162
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:27,115
It appears that
Walter has stepped out, so it's...

1163
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:31,319
Well, it's back to the days of
yore down at the old barbershop.

1164
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:48,437
Oh, no! It's a barbershop quartet!
Get me out of here!

1165
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:54,751
Wait a minute.
What are you doing?

1166
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:57,150
Is that Nirvana? Stop it! No!

1167
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:04,715
You're ruining one of the
greatest songs of all time!

1168
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:08,799
Ow!

1169
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:12,359
Careful around the ears!

1170
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:33,520
Ah! That was hot!

1171
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:36,831
Hey! What's going on here?
Why is my body so big?

1172
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,594
What'd you do to my voice?
I sound like a chipmunk!

1173
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:41,870
Wait a second.
Did you guys shrink my head?

1174
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:44,873
Ladies and gentlemen,
Jack Black!

1175
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:50,751
Nice work, everybody.
Chickens, you're up next!

1176
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:53,275
It's going rather nicely.
We might just make this.

1177
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:56,190
And now I am
pleased and proud to present

1178
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:59,631
those princesses of poultry,
Camilla and friends!

1179
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:47,474
Let's hear it for Camilla
and her farmyard friends!

1180
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:51,952
No, I... I don't know
why I'm not hosting this.

1181
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:54,680
So remember, folks, keep on calling
and you'll help us reach our goal

1182
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:57,440
of ten million dollars by midnight.
And if...

1183
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:00,475
Oh, dear.

1184
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:01,834
Ladies and gentlemen,
don't be alarmed.

1185
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,798
We will get this sorted out
just as soon as we can. Scooter!

1186
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:14,118
Well, that's that. Nice try, Muppets!

1187
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:22,032
Kermit, how are we going to
raise the rest of the money

1188
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:23,355
with no electricity?

1189
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:25,750
All right,
calm down, everybody.

1190
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:32,353
Is everybody OK?
Yeah.

1191
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:35,080
Well, we can't do the show
without power.

1192
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:38,152
Anybody got any bright ideas?
Not now, Fozzie.

1193
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,675
Ten-gauge gator grip.

1194
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:44,675
I love it when you talk shop.

1195
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:56,992
Oh!

1196
01:17:57,160 --> 01:17:58,957
# La la la la la la la
# Mee mee mee mee

1197
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:02,640
What? How'd they get
the power back?

1198
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:05,871
We're gonna have to get up on that roof

1199
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:09,476
and shut'em down for good!
Bolt cutters!

1200
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:11,835
Bolt cutters.

1201
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:14,235
Deadly! You come with me.

1202
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:18,239
That's it.

1203
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:19,753
Hm.

1204
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:30,030
To the end of the Muppets!

1205
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:34,190
Deadly! What are you doing?

1206
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:35,952
Enough!

1207
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:40,636
Just because I have a terrifying name
and an evil English accent,

1208
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:43,837
does not preclude the
fact that, in my heart,

1209
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:48,869
I am a Muppet, not a Moopet!

1210
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:52,794
Looks like it's I who
will have the last laugh!

1211
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:56,475
What does that mean?
It's an idiom, you idiot,

1212
01:18:56,640 --> 01:19:00,474
because you cannot laugh!
Ha ha!

1213
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:02,153
Oopsie.

1214
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:05,155
Deadly.

1215
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:09,392
Now that's a maniacal laugh for you!

1216
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:12,552
Hey, Gary, Mary, how'd
you guys get here so fast?

1217
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:14,790
We travelled by map.
We thought it'd be quicker.

1218
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:17,997
Hey, I'm sorry I bailed. I just...

1219
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:20,230
I realized you don't let
the most important person

1220
01:19:20,440 --> 01:19:22,715
in your world slip away.

1221
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:31,957
Hey, Scooter?
Yeah?

1222
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:34,469
Could you do me a favor
and take over hosting duty?

1223
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:37,438
But, chief, I don't go onstage.

1224
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:41,149
Well, just do what I do.
Pretend that the audience is naked.

1225
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:42,878
Yeah, but, I...

1226
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:44,917
Ha... ha... ha...

1227
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:48,474
Uh, Miss Piggy?

1228
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:08,310
You are all naked.

1229
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:09,879
Well, sorta.

1230
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:13,555
OK. Great!
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

1231
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:16,792
please welcome, a real hero...

1232
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:28,919
You saved it?
After all this time?

1233
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:32,072
Oh, Kermie.

1234
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:45,794
I guess I'm not
that good at saying this kind of stuff.

1235
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:48,110
Yes, Kermie?
Well...

1236
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:53,758
...over the last week,
I realized that...

1237
01:20:55,240 --> 01:20:56,514
...I... I miss you.

1238
01:20:57,560 --> 01:21:00,870
And I need you.

1239
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:07,632
And maybe you don't need the,
the whole world to love you.

1240
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:11,950
Maybe you just need one person.

1241
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:18,279
It's time for our song,
and if we don't raise the money tonight,

1242
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:20,829
it might be the
last time we sing together.

1243
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:26,631
And... Well, are you ready?

1244
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:29,517
Oh, Kermie.

1245
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:40,799
# Why are there so many

1246
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,878
# Songs about rainbows?

1247
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:48,710
# And what's on the other side?

1248
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:53,078
# Rainbows are visions

1249
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:56,312
# But only illusions

1250
01:21:56,480 --> 01:22:01,110
# And rainbows have nothing to hide

1251
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:04,836
# So we've been told

1252
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:09,118
# And some choose to believe it

1253
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:14,115
# I know they're wrong
Wait and see

1254
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:17,997
# Someday we'll find it

1255
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:21,317
# The rainbow connection

1256
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:26,110
# The lovers, the dreamers and me

1257
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:30,159
# All of us under its spell

1258
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:32,072
# We know that it's

1259
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:37,109
# Probably magic

1260
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:41,120
# Have you been half asleep

1261
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:44,556
# And have you heard voices?

1262
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:48,918
# I've heard them calling my name

1263
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:55,794
Hey, these are yours, man.

1264
01:22:55,960 --> 01:22:57,996
I kept'em for ya.

1265
01:22:58,200 --> 01:23:00,475
Drum.
No drum.

1266
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:02,517
Drum!
No drum!

1267
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:04,796
Drum! Drum!
No drum! No drum!

1268
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:13,476
You know what to do.

1269
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:21,199
# I've heard it too many times
to ignore it

1270
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:26,354
# It's something that
I'm supposed to be

1271
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:30,870
Aaah!
# Someday we'll find it

1272
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:33,873
# The rainbow connection

1273
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:38,875
# The lovers, the dreamers and me #

1274
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:54,196
Drum! Drum, drum! Drum!

1275
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:56,078
Ah ha ha ha ha.

1276
01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:57,958
You still got it, man!

1277
01:23:58,120 --> 01:24:03,194
Piggy? Will you stay... for me?

1278
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:05,590
For you, Kermie?
Yeah.

1279
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:06,909
Of course!

1280
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:13,589
Woo hoo!

1281
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:22,199
Thank you, everybody.

1282
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:24,794
Thank you, all.
Ladies and gentlemen,

1283
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:29,238
it's almost midnight and we haven't
quite reached our target yet,

1284
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:33,916
but if you'll all just stick around,
we'll be right back with our final act.

1285
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:37,993
The Muppet Telethon
will return after these messages.

1286
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:44,709
Walter? Walter, where are you, buddy?

1287
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:48,509
Listen, everybody, the show ran short,
and we don't have anything else planned.

1288
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:51,552
We need one last act
to bring us home.

1289
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:54,518
I'm gonna go check on Jack Black
and see if he has any ideas.

1290
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:55,999
You guys see if you can
come up with something.

1291
01:24:56,160 --> 01:24:58,196
We have two minutes! Two minutes!

1292
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:01,710
Think, think, think!
What am I thinking?

1293
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:05,190
Walter. Walt!

1294
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:07,917
Walter!
Gary?

1295
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:11,510
Wha... You came back.
Walter.

1296
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:13,398
What are you doing down here?

1297
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:17,189
They just need one more act. You gotta
get out there and help those guys.

1298
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:21,797
I can't. What if people
laugh at me? I...

1299
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:26,511
I'd rather go back home to Smalltown.
With you.

1300
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,798
Look, Walter, you're my brother,

1301
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:37,557
and I'm always gonna love you,
but you belong here, with these guys.

1302
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:40,837
Hey, you're the one
who got Kermit to do this.

1303
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,560
You're the one who brought
everyone here together.

1304
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:48,350
You always believe in other people,
but that's easy.

1305
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:51,876
Sooner or later, you gotta
believe in yourself, too,

1306
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:55,038
because that's what growing up is.

1307
01:25:56,120 --> 01:25:58,953
It's becoming who you want to be.

1308
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:02,829
You have to try. Please, Walter.

1309
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:06,434
You're my hero.

1310
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:22,072
OK, Jack Black's got nothing.
What did you guys come up with?

1311
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:25,636
Bunsen can set Beaker on fire.
No, no, no, we can't do that.

1312
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:28,553
I could break out the fart shoes.
No, no, no, that will never work!

1313
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:29,869
We're back in three, two...

1314
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:34,160
Oh, no!

1315
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:52,038
It's Walter.

1316
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:54,712
Thank you.

1317
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:59,112
He's all grown up.
Oh, that was wonderful!

1318
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:04,909
Ladies and gentlemen, Walter!

1319
01:28:05,080 --> 01:28:07,674
It looks like we're going
to get our studio back!

1320
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:11,919
the Muppets are
about to take back their studio.

1321
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:21,273
Help! I've been mugged.
Alerting authorities.

1322
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:23,835
We're sorry...
What happened? Hello?

1323
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,673
Hello?
Guys, my phone is dead.

1324
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:32,358
News flash: My phone is also dead.
Repeat, my phone is also dead.

1325
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:36,718
Ooh...

1326
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:51,589
I did it. I beat you.

1327
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:59,994
Game over, Kermit. You lost.

1328
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:02,835
Chicky!

1329
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:07,232
Too late, Muppets. I won!
Turn that thing off!

1330
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:10,876
The show is over!

1331
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:12,792
But we were so close!

1332
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:20,515
Or not.

1333
01:29:20,680 --> 01:29:22,796
It kinda makes me
feel better, honestly.

1334
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,594
I mean, we were
nowhere close at all.

1335
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:29,833
You artists formerly
known as the Muppets

1336
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,798
are standing on private property.

1337
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:35,838
My private property.

1338
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,798
And I'm telling you to leave. Now!

1339
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:49,753
He's right, everybody.

1340
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:53,469
He won. We gotta go.

1341
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:07,718
Not now, Fozzie.

1342
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:13,634
I can't believe this.
I know.

1343
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:21,310
Well, that's that.

1344
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:29,475
This isn't right.

1345
01:30:29,640 --> 01:30:31,517
It can't end like this.

1346
01:30:31,680 --> 01:30:33,511
But what can we do?

1347
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:52,157
Listen, everybody, we've got nothing
to be ashamed of. And you know why?

1348
01:30:53,160 --> 01:30:58,359
Well, because thanks
to Walter here, we tried.

1349
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:00,795
And if we failed, we failed together,

1350
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:06,273
and to me, that's not failing at all.

1351
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:09,233
And I don't care what anybody says.

1352
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:15,675
And I don't care if no one
believes in us, because I believe.

1353
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:18,877
I believe in you.
Huh?

1354
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:21,156
And you.
Me?

1355
01:31:21,320 --> 01:31:25,199
And you.

1356
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:28,272
You know, what's important
isn't this building or a name.

1357
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:31,159
It's each other. So I say, fine,

1358
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:33,914
let's just start at the bottom
and work our way back up to the top.

1359
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:37,072
Yeah.
Let's all walk out through these doors

1360
01:31:37,240 --> 01:31:42,678
with our heads held high. As a family.

1361
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:46,719
Because that's what we are.
Yeah. Yeah.

1362
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:34,880
Muppets, Muppets, Muppets!

1363
01:32:39,720 --> 01:32:41,278
Wow.

1364
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:47,153
Muppets, Muppets, Muppets!

1365
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:53,432
All right.

1366
01:32:56,040 --> 01:32:58,634
Wow.
Wow.

1367
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:04,228
Hey, where's Walter?

1368
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:09,793
See? Your fans, they love you guys!

1369
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:12,190
Hey, Walter.
Aren't you gonna join us?

1370
01:33:12,360 --> 01:33:13,873
Yeah! Come on!
Come on, Walter!

1371
01:33:14,040 --> 01:33:16,600
Come on, Walter!
Yes. Come!

1372
01:33:16,760 --> 01:33:20,878
What're you waiting for, buddy?
Get over there.

1373
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:23,110
Yeah, go ahead.

1374
01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:52,917
Muppets! Muppets!
Muppets! Muppets! Muppets!

1375
01:34:09,240 --> 01:34:10,958
Hm? Oh.

1376
01:34:11,160 --> 01:34:14,152
How charming. A finale.

1377
01:34:21,680 --> 01:34:24,114
# Everything is great

1378
01:34:24,280 --> 01:34:26,111
# Everything is grand

1379
01:34:26,280 --> 01:34:31,638
# We've got the whole wide world
in the palm of our hand

1380
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:33,756
# Everything is perfect

1381
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:36,115
# It's falling into place

1382
01:34:36,280 --> 01:34:40,193
# I can't seem to wipe
this smile off my face

1383
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:42,038
# Life's a happy song

1384
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:45,715
# When there's someone
by your side to sing along

1385
01:34:48,040 --> 01:34:51,589
# Everything is great
And we'll live happily ever after

1386
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:54,115
# And we'll keep giving the world
the third greatest gift

1387
01:34:54,280 --> 01:34:55,315
# Laughter

1388
01:34:55,480 --> 01:34:58,950
# Ze movie's almost over
It's time to say, "So long"

1389
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:02,510
# Will you please stop singing?
You've already sung this song

1390
01:35:02,680 --> 01:35:05,353
# Life's a happy song when there's
someone by your side

1391
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:06,919
# To sing along

1392
01:35:07,080 --> 01:35:08,798
We're happier when you don't sing.

1393
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:14,116
# We've got everything that we need

1394
01:35:14,280 --> 01:35:16,669
# We can be whatever we want to be

1395
01:35:16,840 --> 01:35:20,150
# Nothing we can't do

1396
01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:23,909
# The skies are blue
when it's me and you and you and you

1397
01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:26,389
# And you and you and you and you

1398
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:27,709
Well, all of you. Yeah!

1399
01:35:27,880 --> 01:35:31,509

1401
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:36,432
Hey, remember me? I'm Jack Black!

1402
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:39,273
No, what are you doing? Whoa, whoa.
No, no, no. Put me back down.

1403
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:41,874
All hail the Hobo King.
What are you doing? This is insane.

1415
01:36:32,040 --> 01:36:34,076
I just have one question
I need to ask you.

1416
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:38,879
Will you, Mary... marry me?

1420
01:36:48,680 --> 01:36:49,669
I own that name.

1421
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:52,559
Hey, guys, I think I've finally
worked out how to...

1422
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:56,831
"Oil" bet that hurt.

1423
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:04,198
This just in: "Richman gives
back Muppet theater and name.
