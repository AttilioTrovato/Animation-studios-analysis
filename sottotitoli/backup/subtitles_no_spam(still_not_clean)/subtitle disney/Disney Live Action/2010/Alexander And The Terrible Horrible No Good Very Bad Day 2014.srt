1
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:47,030
<i>My parents
say there's no such thing as a bad day.</i>

2
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:49,510
<i>That it's all how you look at it.</i>

3
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:52,036
<i>What can I tell you? Parents.</i>

4
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:54,470
<i>Here is what I know.</i>

5
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,950
<i>They're wrong.</i>

6
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,270
<i>My name is Alexander,
and I'm the expert in bad days.</i>

7
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,470
<i>This guy knows what I'm talking about.
That's not coming off.</i>

8
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:09,390
<i>Did I mention my dad
is a relentless optimist?</i>

9
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:10,710
We're in the home stretch.

10
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:11,790
<i>And look at Mom.</i>

11
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,601
<i>She's not fooling anyone
with that "Mom smile."</i>

12
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,910
<i>Believe it or not,
by the time we got home...</i>

13
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:23,311
<i>this van was in better
shape than we were.</i>

14
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,237
<i>There's my sister Emily, the actress.</i>

15
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,230
<i>Always ready to take a bow.</i>

16
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:37,521
<i>Anthony, my brother, a total winner
with a great sense of style.</i>

17
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,270
<i>And baby Trevor.</i>

18
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,830
<i>Sorry, pal.
Definitely not coming off.</i>

19
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:48,510
<i>Bottom line, today was an epic disaster.
The worst day possible.</i>

20
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,750
<i>Everyone in my family would agree.</i>

21
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:54,110
<i>But what they don't know,
is it was all my fault.</i>

22
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:56,113
<i>And it wasn't over yet.</i>

23
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:30,670
You overslept, bud.

24
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,110
Don't blow my didgeridoo!

25
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,158
What's it for, then?

26
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:51,072
<i>You're invited!
Philip Parker turning 12.</i>

27
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,231
Tomorrow night?

28
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,870
No!

29
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,590
He's the trick to... Good morning!

30
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,470
There she is!

31
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:02,430
You are going to be so impressed.

32
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:04,430
I made what is known as...

33
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:07,390
the crustless quiche, the frittata.

34
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,910
What is this?

35
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:11,590
Two months ago, you couldn't even
grill cheese, and now...

36
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,830
Oh, that looks so good.

37
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:16,830
Egg and cheese.

38
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,116
Excellent.

39
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:19,390
Thank you.

40
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,990
So, what are you gentlemen up to today?

41
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,030
Well, let's see.

42
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,310
Em has a dentist appointment
this morning...

43
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,390
Right, right.

44
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,870
And then the two of us
are going to Mommy and Me Yoga.

45
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,350
- Oh, with Summer?
- Yes.

46
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,710
Will you tell her I still exist?

47
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:34,190
I will. And then when he takes his nap,

48
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:35,790
I'm gonna send out some resumes.

49
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:36,950
Good.

50
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,550
What a to-do to die today
at a minute or two to two.

51
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,590
A thing distinctly hard to say
but harder still to do.

52
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:44,390
We'll beat a tattoo at a minute or two
and a rat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tattoo...

53
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,590
and the dragon will come
to the beat of the drum

54
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:46,790
at a minute or two to two today...

55
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:47,910
at a minute or two to two.

56
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:49,750
- I need to pee.
- You have gum in your hair.

57
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,870
A big black bug bit a big black bear...

58
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:53,111
No!

59
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:04,110
Anthony! Alexander!
Accelerate. Come on!

60
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,555
One minute!

61
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,039
Hey, if it ain't broke, right?

62
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:15,590
Guess what?

63
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:18,401
Philip Parker's having
his birthday party tomorrow night.

64
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,470
That's when
you're having your birthday party.

65
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,470
I know! And I just got the invitation.

66
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,310
He's going all-out, Dad.

67
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,150
He's getting an energy drink bar,

68
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:27,750
a Korean taco truck, a live band.

69
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:28,790
That sounds legit.

70
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,910
I think he's having black lights
and a karaoke machine.

71
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,196
Oh, I love karaoke parties.

72
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,239
Look, can I compete with all of that?

73
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:38,030
Oh, come on,
your birthday's gonna be great.

74
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:41,430
It's gonna be fun. We're gonna have
pizza. I'm gonna make a cake.

75
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:43,270
Maybe some volleyball in the pool.

76
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,950
Philip Parker's having a fog machine
and we're having pizza?

77
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,430
- Don't worry.
- You're drinking coffee?

78
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,510
What about my party?

79
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:49,590
Since when did
you start drinking coffee?

80
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:51,001
I'm not a morning person.

81
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,070
- Can you check his diaper?
-

82
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,310
You just dropped Bumble Bee.

83
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,270
- You drop Bumble Bee?
- I think he might be wet.

84
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:59,270
No. Bumble Bee. There you go.

85
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,430
Wish I could be there, bro,

86
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,670
but I got prom tomorrow night.

87
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,910
I thought that was next week.

88
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:03,950
It is what it is.

89
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,310
I'll probably be wiped out
from my <i>Peter</i> Pan premiere...

90
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,950
but I'll be happy to sing for you
and all of your friends.

91
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,030
No, no, no.

92
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,110
<i>Think of</i> a wonderful thought...

93
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,716
Oh, probably Mrs. Gibson. Okay.

94
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,830
Honey, Dad's taking Emily to the dentist.

95
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,470
I've got Anthony. So you're in carpool.

96
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,830
- Take a frittata. It's a crustless quiche.
- There you go.

97
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,310
What did you do to your hair?

98
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,630
Oh, nothing.

99
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:24,714
Say hi to Mrs. Gibson!
Remember your manners.

100
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,839
Hi, Becky!

101
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,834
Hey, Alexander.

102
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,760
Oh, are you okay?

103
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:50,350
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

104
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,511
Let's go, kids.

105
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:55,073
<i>And so I cry sometimes
when I'm lying in bed</i>

106
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:58,750
<i>Just to get it all out, what's in my head</i>

107
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:03,631
<i>And I, I am feeling a little peculiar...</i>

108
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,039
<i>Lord of the Flies?</i>

109
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,600
Pretty scary, right?

110
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:13,990
<i>Lord of the Flies is beautiful, Alexander.</i>

111
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,590
It's a deep and meaningful allegory

112
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:17,590
about our own messed-up society.

113
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:18,710
Yeah, totally.

114
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,550
That's what I meant with "scary."

115
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,281
The society stuff. Crazy.

116
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,950
Hey, check out this app.

117
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:28,430
He puts your face on
some bikini model's body.

118
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,030
It's really gross and sexist.

119
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:31,390
This is gonna be hilarious.

120
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:32,950
- What are you doing?
- Wait, hold on!

121
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,150
- No, no, no.
- I'm not done.

122
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,471
Hey, babe.

123
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:42,590
Is everything okay?
Your last text was so cold.

124
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:45,681
No, I said, "See you at school"?

125
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,838
Yeah. I'm your girlfriend, Anthony.

126
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:52,390
You really should end your texts
with "x-o-x-o" or "I heart you."

127
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:55,790
You can make a heart
with the less-than sign and a three.

128
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,950
Yeah, I'll try to remember.

129
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:01,230
So, a bunch of the girls were talking,
and they're all going in limos.

130
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,230
We are getting a limo tomorrow, right?

131
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,750
No, I am taking
my driver's test tomorrow, babe.

132
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,590
The first thing I wanna
do as a licensed driver

133
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,470
is chauffeur you to the prom.

134
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:11,359
It'll be romantic and stuff.

135
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:15,270
Well, I do want it to be romantic.

136
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,590
It Will be.

137
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:19,350
Also, I have it
from a very good source who says...

138
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,950
we're being crowned Duke and Duchess

139
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,790
at the Royal Court
tomorrow night at prom.

140
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:25,350
- That's so tight!
- I know. Isn't it like the best thing ever?

141
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,630
This is the worst thing ever.

142
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,110
These look so real.

143
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,870
I can't believe
Elliot text-bombed the whole school.

144
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,950
Don't worry about it, man.
Elliot's an idiot.

145
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,555
No one's even gonna look at these.

146
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,270
Hey, Paul.

147
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:45,510
Philip, my man.

148
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,955
Nice boobs, Alexander.

149
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,790
Since when are you friends
with Philip Parker?

150
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,910
We go to the same
psychopharmacologist.

151
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:57,950
He's got ADHD, too. He's super nice.

152
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:59,030
No, he's not.

153
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:02,310
He's throwing a huge party tomorrow,
and it's not even his actual birthday.

154
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,070
His is next week.

155
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,430
You realize it's just gonna
be you and me at my party.

156
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,831
- Actually, it might just be you.
- What?

157
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,830
You've gotta come.
You're my best friend.

158
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:15,990
Okay, but personally,
I think you should just postpone.

159
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:18,710
Philip's popular
and everybody's gonna be there.

160
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,270
Plus, his party sounds pretty dope.

161
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:22,830
Dude, last year
your dad tap-danced with a cane.

162
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,478
Another bad party could
ruin your rep forever.

163
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,990
Your dad's a nice guy, but trust me...

164
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:30,277
you do not want
your entire social life in his hands.

165
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:34,830
Great job!

166
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:36,670
Yeah!

167
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,950
Breathe. You gave birth.
You can do this.

168
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:42,430
Two. One.

169
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:46,754
Take your baby back to the womb.
They love it there.

170
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:55,116
I think that it's so cool when a guy can
step up to be a full-time fommy.

171
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:56,751
A what?

172
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:58,271
A father-mommy.

173
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,110
Okay.

174
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:02,796
Um, yeah,
I guess I'm sort of a fommy by default.

175
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:06,550
I was in aerospace,
and I got transitioned out of my job.

176
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,670
Oh, I'm sorry.

177
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,230
No, that's okay. I get to spend
more time with this little guy.

178
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:11,791
Excuse me.

179
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,314
Hello?

180
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:16,000
Yes, this is Ben Cooper.

181
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,550
Tomorrow?

182
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,075
Yes, that's good.

183
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:22,670
Okay, I'll see you then.

184
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,593
I look forward to it, Greg. Bye-bye.

185
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,230
Good news?

186
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:28,190
Yeah! I landed an interview.

187
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,630
Hey! That's great.

188
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:32,310
What do you think of that?
What do you think of that?

189
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:35,390
Fommy just landed an interview.

190
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,596
Fommy.

191
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,310
Did you hear him say that?

192
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,390
Yes!

193
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:41,550
He just said Fommy!

194
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,470
You just said my name!

195
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:46,190
Guys, he just said Fommy.
Did you hear him say Fommy?

196
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,476
I'm Fommy. Fommy!

197
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:48,750
That was so cool.

198
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,990
It's so adorable!

199
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:53,310
I am Fommy, and he said it.

200
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:55,430
So, with our celebrity readings,

201
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,590
our great grassroots
marketing campaign...

202
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:58,710
Thank you, Julie...

203
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,550
and the positive reviews
we have coming in...

204
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:04,030
we are poised for a really strong roll-out.

205
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:06,590
Tomorrow, we are
going to ask America...

206
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,870
"Who is ready to jump on the potty?"

207
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:13,270
And I'm confident our sales are going
to leap over expectations.

208
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,950
I know I would have
appreciated this book

209
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,990
when I was potty-training my kids!

210
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,481
That's Alexander, my son.

211
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:20,950
Thank you, guys!

212
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:23,112
Thank you for all your support with this.

213
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:28,030
Oh, man.

214
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:30,110
I hope that was
thorough enough for you, Nina.

215
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:32,350
Well, I'm going to need you to make

216
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,630
an incredible effort
on "the Potty" tomorrow.

217
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:36,110
On "the Potty."

218
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:38,630
- What?
- You can count on me.

219
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:42,430
Good. Because if this goes well,
I'm going to make you VP.

220
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:43,510
Really?

221
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,630
Have you run
Children's Lit and Young Adult.

222
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,310
Thank you!

223
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,676
Thank you.

224
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,310
I'm going to need you

225
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:53,790
every second of every minute
of every day.

226
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:56,030
- Got it.
- 24/7, 365.

227
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:57,390
That's a lot of numbers.

228
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:58,471
Is that a joke?

229
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:02,350
I have four kids that I'll just have
to carve out a little time to see.

230
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:05,110
Right, right, of course.
Of course you will.

231
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:07,150
Isn't that one of
your darling little babies right there?

232
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:08,311
Yeah, it is.

233
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:11,150
So you're seeing him right now.

234
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,710
All right, country reports.

235
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:16,150
As you all know,
this is your big project this semester.

236
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:17,470
- So, what I think...
- Mr. Rogue?

237
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,070
Yeah, Alexander.

238
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,590
I would like to take Australia.

239
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,550
I know a ton about it.

240
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,630
And I have my own didgeridoo.

241
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:28,954
Yeah, I'm sure there a lot of students
here who want Australia. Am I right?

242
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:36,231
So to be fair, this semester...

243
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,430
I'm going to let the globe
decide what country.

244
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:41,590
We'll start with you, Alexander.

245
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:42,956
You ready? Here we go.

246
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:44,590
Australia. Australia. Australia.

247
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,081
What will it be?

248
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,350
Djibouti.

249
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:51,710
Look at that, the Horn of Africa!
All right, Djibouti!

250
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:52,990
Dji... what?

251
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:55,994
Who's gonna be next here?
Philip Parker. Here we go.

252
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,830
Australia.

253
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,950
So, like,
Arnold Schwarzenegger and stuff?

254
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,430
That's Austria, not Australia.

255
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,910
- Can we switch?
- No.

256
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,072
Okay, Albert Morio.

257
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,432
Lebanon. That's good.

258
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:16,956
Partner up,
everybody! Get your aprons on. Guys.

259
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:19,831
Becky...

260
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:21,793
do you want to partner?

261
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:24,754
Okay. You can take lab notes.

262
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,878
.5 milligrams of boron.

263
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:31,481
Boron... Boring!

264
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:38,596
So, Becky, I'm having
a birthday party tomorrow night.

265
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,710
It was only gonna be guys, but I can...

266
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:45,110
Oh, thanks, but I'm going
to Philip Parker's party tomorrow night.

267
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,990
I think everyone is.

268
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,676
He has a frozen yogurt machine
and a trampoline.

269
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,750
So do we!

270
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:54,481
We have a frozen yogurt machine
and a trampoline.

271
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,590
- Oh, my God!
- Well, yeah...

272
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:57,870
My lab book!

273
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,998
Put it out!

274
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:05,071
Put it out!

275
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,070
Who's responsible for this?

276
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,231
Alexander!

277
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:26,070
Hey, Alexander! Hold up.

278
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,790
Hey, hold up!

279
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,750
I'm leaving for a conference

280
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:31,910
and nobody signed up
to take Melvin home.

281
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,833
I can't leave him alone all weekend.

282
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,150
So, what do you want me to do?

283
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:39,234
Well, you'll make
a furry friend a little less lonely.

284
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:57,961
Unbelievable.

285
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:13,470
Cool, we're hosting a guinea pig.

286
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:14,631
All right!

287
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,510
Sorry we're late.

288
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,592
We had a little
diaper trauma at Trader Joe's.

289
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:21,710
Hello!

290
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,350
- Hi!
- Hi, Mom.

291
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,432
There's my big boy. Hi!

292
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:28,313
There you are. Hi, big guy.

293
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,270
- What is that?
- Melvin.

294
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:33,430
We're hosting
Melvin this weekend.

295
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:34,511
Oh, boy.

296
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,270
Alexander, would you grab that
and wash it off, please?

297
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,270
He needs Bumble Bee like he needs air.

298
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:42,350
I know, honey pie.

299
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:44,710
And after that, the pig goes upstairs.

300
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:45,950
It's okay.

301
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:48,910
Bumble Bee's
just getting a bath. It will be right back.

302
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:51,357
Alexander, we could use Bumble Bee.

303
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:56,437
Bumble Bee is coming right back,
right back, right back any second.

304
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,551
Dad, don't!

305
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,674
What was that?

306
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:15,159
Honey, Bumble Bee's gone.

307
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,390
<i>Peter</i> Pan is going to be awesome.

308
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:21,790
Today, Mr. Brand said that I am the most
poised and elegant Peter Pan...

309
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,510
he's ever had
the privilege of working with.

310
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,400
No way!
When is that, again? Just remind me.

311
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:29,110
- Mom, hello! It's tomorrow afternoon!
- Of course.

312
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:31,238
Please be on time
and don't be embarrassing.

313
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,390
Best behavior.

314
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,030
Honey, please don't
embarrass our daughter.

315
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,590
- Dad, that includes you.
- I know.

316
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,230
I'll be there, honey, don't worry.

317
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:39,190
Guess who's getting
crowned Duke at the prom tomorrow.

318
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,830
Really? Congratulations.

319
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:44,350
Yeah, it's not official,
but Celia heard from a good source.

320
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:45,550
It's kind of crazy.

321
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,430
I'm dating the hottest girl in school...

322
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,590
I'm getting crowned at prom,
and once I get my license tomorrow...

323
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:52,470
I kind of have
everything I've ever wanted.

324
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,678
- Hashtag blessed, you know.
- Wait.

325
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,750
Once you get your license tomorrow?

326
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,190
I'm taking my test after school.

327
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,270
Dad already said it was cool.

328
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:00,430
You said it was cool?

329
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:03,190
I said it was doable.
Not cool. I said it was doable.

330
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,390
Okay.

331
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,190
It will be fine. We'll make it.

332
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,681
Okay, guys, I have some news.

333
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:11,350
Nina said that
if the book launch goes well tomorrow...

334
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:14,150
you could be looking at the new
Vice President of Lone Hill Press.

335
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:15,311
Honey!

336
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,030
That's big.

337
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,190
Yeah, it would
be a lot more hours at work...

338
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:22,510
I already feel like I live there some days,
but the raise would be nice.

339
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,911
Awesome. I have some news as well.

340
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:29,430
I got a call today. I have an interview
for a game design firm.

341
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,790
They're looking for engineers.

342
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,630
- Wait, video games? Really?
- Yeah. Yeah.

343
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:35,070
Your aerospace engineering dad
might be designing video games.

344
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,910
- That's so cool.
- I know. I know.

345
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:41,553
The best news of all...
Guess who spoke his first word today?

346
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,670
Trevor.

347
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,990
- No!
- Yes.

348
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,030
What did you say?

349
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:48,510
What was it?

350
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,950
He said fommy.

351
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:51,390
- He said fommy?
- Yeah.

352
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,393
- What's that?
- Father-mommy.

353
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,630
I didn't know that was a word.

354
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,670
We all had pretty big wins today.

355
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,190
- Yeah.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

356
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:00,310
I had a crap day.

357
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:02,279
What is that smell?

358
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:04,830
It's Vegemite.
It's from Australia, and back off!

359
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:05,910
Hey, hey, hey!

360
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,550
Easy. You're gonna have
a good day tomorrow.

361
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:10,470
It's your birthday. You have friends
coming over, it's gonna be a great party.

362
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:13,550
Actually, you can forget it,
because I'm canceling my party.

363
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,110
- What are you talking about?
- Why?

364
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:16,396
Nobody's coming.

365
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:19,070
They're all going
to Philip Parker's party tomorrow night.

366
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:20,350
Who is this Philip Parker?

367
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:23,510
He's a really cool kid
with a hot tub and ADHD.

368
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:25,630
- I'm gonna call his mom...
- No!

369
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:28,710
No, no, no.
We're gonna forget about Philip Parker.

370
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:31,030
Whoever comes to the party comes.
It's gonna be great.

371
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,950
Trust me, nobody is coming.

372
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:36,670
Elliot Gibson texted pictures of me
in a butt thong to everyone at school.

373
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,510
My best friend
is suddenly best friends with Philip...

374
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:42,350
because they go to the same
dumb psychopharmacologist.

375
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:44,230
I didn't get Australia
for my school report...

376
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:47,710
and I burned down the science lab
with Becky Gibson's lab notes.

377
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:50,150
- What did you do?
- You burned down the science lab?

378
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:52,150
Dude, big deal.
So things didn't go your way today.

379
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,590
Go my way?

380
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,190
It was a totally wrecked bad day.

381
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,396
And it's not just today!

382
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:59,070
It is every single day. Every day!

383
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:02,070
You don't even care
because your lives are all so perfect!

384
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:03,510
No, we care. We care, honey.

385
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,390
- What?
- Sweetie.

386
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:06,590
Where's Bumble Bee?

387
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:09,870
Alexander murdered it,
so now he's going to cry all night.

388
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,350
- Can't you just get him a new one?
- No.

389
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:13,353
It's only Bumble Bee.
It's the only one he likes.

390
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:14,550
It's gotta be Bumble Bee.

391
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:15,710
I can't deal with this.

392
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,315
I'm going to rehearse in the car.

393
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:20,870
Maybe this is the time
to wean him from the pacifier.

394
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:22,110
Honey, easy for you to say.

395
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,680
You're not here with him all day.

396
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:29,910
<i>Think of</i> a <i>wonderful thought
Any merry little thought</i>

397
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:31,710
<i>Think of Christmas, think of snow</i>

398
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,510
<i>Think of sleigh bells, off you go</i>

399
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,590
<i>Like reindeer in the sky</i>

400
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:39,834
<i>You can fly, you can fly
You can fly</i>

401
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:56,311
Anthony?

402
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:59,478
I feel like no one understands me.

403
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:02,681
I do. I get you.

404
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,481
You do?

405
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:08,761
Yeah. Come on, you're amazing.

406
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:10,871
Really?

407
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:12,790
You think I'm amazing?

408
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:16,192
Honestly, I love you so much.

409
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,919
I love you, too.

410
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,521
I love you more.

411
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,990
No, I love you more.

412
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,801
And don't get me started
on that cute little butt of yours.

413
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:31,031
What?

414
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,070
What?

415
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:35,310
Why are you "what" -ing me?

416
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:36,596
What's your problem?

417
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:39,350
<i>- Excuse me'?
- You know what? You're so annoying.</i>

418
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:41,190
Why can't you just chill out?
For one second?

419
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,950
You're exhausting.

420
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:44,191
Are you kidding?

421
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,752
Sorry, Celia. That was my idiot brother.

422
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:53,761
Celia?

423
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,081
Seriously?

424
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,240
Now she won't pick up!

425
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,550
I'm worried about Alexander.

426
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:06,873
I mean, of all the years for
everyone to bail on his birthday.

427
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:12,750
He's been so moody
since I had Trevor and started work.

428
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:14,390
Don't worry about it. He's 12.

429
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:15,830
Everybody's moody at that age.

430
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,110
How's he already 12?

431
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,999
I know. Just happened.

432
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:22,590
That's the problem.
Everything is just happening so fast.

433
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:23,670
Yeah.

434
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:24,790
This house is like a train station.

435
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:26,395
Everyone's coming and going...

436
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,752
and Trevor's first word was "Fommy."

437
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,870
- Maybe I misheard that.
- I don't think you did.

438
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:34,951
Honey, come on.

439
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:39,113
I got the kids covered.
I got the house covered.

440
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:41,154
You're killing it at work.

441
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:43,359
Things have never been better.

442
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,750
Oh, please.

443
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,070
- Never been better?
- It's true.

444
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:47,151
Ben...

445
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,992
you've been unemployed
for the past seven months.

446
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,630
Aren't you stressed out?

447
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:53,916
Yeah. A little bit.

448
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,354
Why aren't you freaking out more?

449
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,950
What good would freaking out do?

450
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:01,317
Then I'd just be freaked out
and unemployed.

451
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:07,000
Tomorrow I'm gonna nail that interview.

452
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:10,676
Big day tomorrow.

453
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,520
It's 12:01, Melvin.

454
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:23,956
It's my birthday.

455
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,554
You ever feel alone in the world?

456
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:34,353
I just wish they understood!

457
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:38,030
I just wish they knew what it felt like...

458
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:41,034
to have a terrible, horrible,
no good, very bad day!

459
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:30,435
Shouldn't you guys be up?

460
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,151
Who hit snooze?

461
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:33,310
- What time is it?
- Who hit snooze?

462
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:35,190
- It's morning. It's morning.
- Okay, okay. Go, go, go.

463
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,270
- I have to take a shower.
- All right. Okay, okay.

464
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:40,914
All right, okay. All right.

465
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:45,594
Does anyone know
where the diapers are?

466
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:50,431
I'm in here!

467
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,071
Hey, honey?

468
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:56,510
You look terrible. Are you okay?

469
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:59,321
No, I'm not okay.
Peter Pan can't have a cold, Dad.

470
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:00,671
Okay.

471
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,111
Oh, come...

472
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:07,271
Harsh.

473
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:11,393
Bro, I gotta take a shower. I gotta
get to school. Celia won't call me back.

474
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:15,158
No! No way, not today!

475
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,430
Get out, dude.

476
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:17,550
Get out!

477
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:19,758
Why today?
This is the worst day! No!

478
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:27,030
I am so late. Emily?

479
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,750
I'm coming in for a razor, honey.

480
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:30,510
- Mom!
- Mom!

481
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:31,910
Mom, get out!

482
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:32,950
I'm sorry!

483
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:36,034
Sorry. Sorry. I'll wear pants!

484
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:38,719
Mother!

485
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:48,834
- Good morning.
- Speak for yourself.

486
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:51,670
- Dad?
- Yeah!

487
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:54,430
Trevor's peeing! Where's his diaper?

488
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:55,591
I'm looking!

489
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,910
Hey! There's the birthday boy.

490
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:01,991
Okay, come here.

491
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:06,270
Okay, you know what?
I want you to have a great day.

492
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:08,390
You are the captain of your ship.

493
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:10,430
Steer your ship with positivity.

494
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:12,751
Come on!

495
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:14,630
What is wrong with you people?

496
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:15,711
Anthony!

497
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:16,910
Dad, are you okay?

498
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,390
Look, you're older already.

499
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:21,750
I'm sorry, honey, I have to run.
I have a huge event...

500
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,230
and my foot is killing me.
I'm already late.

501
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:24,510
Ben, put a diaper on it.

502
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:25,670
We'll celebrate tonight, okay?

503
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:26,751
I'm trying.

504
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:46,078
Emily!

505
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:48,712
Emily? Emily!

506
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:51,950
You left the light on in my car all night.

507
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,031
The battery's dead.

508
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:56,230
I'm the one who had to rehearse
in a cold car, and now I'm sick!

509
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,391
Peter Pan!

510
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,310
- What happened to your head?
- Ben, we gotta go!

511
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:01,510
It's a zit. Is it that bad?

512
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,670
You should put a Band-Aid on that.

513
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:05,750
Ben! We have got to go!
You are my ride. Let's go, people.

514
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:08,401
Alexander, into the car.
We have got to go!

515
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:10,797
Everybody, out of the house!
Broom it out!

516
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:14,670
Get out of your comfort zone.
Push it. Push it.

517
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,510
You miss Bumble Bee, don't you?

518
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:17,710
Why is Anthony driving?

519
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:19,030
I feel sick enough as it is.

520
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,470
I need practice for my driver's test today.

521
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:22,712
Okay! Then can we at least
change the music, please?

522
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:28,510
That's good. Leave that!

523
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:30,510
You like that? Yeah! That's good.

524
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:32,030
Wonderful.

525
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,190
I can't believe I'm sick.

526
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:36,350
I cannot believe that
this guy is 12 years old.

527
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:37,431
Thanks, Dad.

528
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:39,350
This is not gonna work for me.

529
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:42,510
You're gonna have to get around there,
make a left on Brookwood.

530
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:44,350
- There's no room.
- Get aggressive!

531
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:46,230
We have places to be.
You're doing great.

532
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:48,310
Mom, do you mind? Please.

533
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:49,994
What? Because of this morning?

534
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:53,230
It's not the first time
I've seen your penis, Anthony!

535
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:55,278
- Mom saw your penis?
- Yep!

536
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:56,870
I've seen yours too, Alexander.

537
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:58,310
I've seen every penis in this car!

538
00:25:58,630 --> 00:25:59,631
Every penis.

539
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:01,230
Come on!

540
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:02,801
Excuse me, sir!

541
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:06,070
Excuse me, sir,
in the ironic Mini Cooper!

542
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:08,039
You're gonna have
to put down the latte...

543
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:10,230
and move or I am gonna
come and do it for you!

544
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:12,597
Sir, I am gonna come... Thank you, son.

545
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:15,750
Easy, hon.

546
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:17,390
Nice and slow. Nice and slow, sweets.

547
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:19,074
Gently, gently.

548
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,151
There you go, honey.

549
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,630
Move, move, move.

550
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:31,870
Go, go, go.

551
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:33,230
It's okay, baby.

552
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,910
Mom's gotta go. Have a good day.

553
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:36,230
Do you have lunch money?

554
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:37,590
- Yes?
- Got it.

555
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:38,671
Love you.

556
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:39,791
Mom!

557
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:43,270
This is not gonna work.
This is not gonna work!

558
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:46,190
Let's go! Fold in.
Woodwinds, make a window!

559
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:48,150
Come on! Let's go, kids!

560
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:50,312
The bell is ringing! Go, march, march!

561
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:53,515
Move it on in there. Fold in. Hustle!

562
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:56,151
Excuse me! Excuse me! Okay, come on!

563
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,879
This day is so cursed.

564
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:01,830
Everybody move out of the way.

565
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:03,470
Just move out of the way.
Make a window!

566
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,950
- Go. Here.
- All right.

567
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:09,919
Goodbye. Take your stuff.

568
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:12,710
Have a good day, honey!

569
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:13,791
Here we go, boys.

570
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:20,070
Celia!

571
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:21,790
Celia, wait up! What's wrong?

572
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:23,630
You haven't answered your phone
since last night.

573
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:26,630
Why do you care?
I thought I was so exhausting.

574
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:27,950
I wasn't talking to you.

575
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,510
I was talking to my idiot brother.

576
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,070
- Whatever.
- I tried calling you back!

577
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,230
I really didn't feel like talking to you.

578
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:35,150
I just don't think you understand...

579
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:38,074
the emotional responsibilities
that come from having a girlfriend.

580
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:40,595
Wait, are you breaking up with me?

581
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:43,921
What about tonight?

582
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:45,596
I don't even wanna go.

583
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:52,310
Sorry. Morning!

584
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:53,391
Good morning!

585
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:56,350
Try calling again!

586
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:58,310
Sorry I'm late. I had a little car trouble.

587
00:27:58,390 --> 00:27:59,915
My husband had to drop me off.

588
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:03,073
- What happened?
- This happened!

589
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:05,790
And not just the cover. No.

590
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:08,710
15 times throughout the book.

591
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:11,390
But it must be
some horrible mistake at the printer!

592
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:14,670
I don't know, Cooper.
You're the one who did the final proof!

593
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,590
We can't have that in a children's book!

594
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:19,833
We just pulled the plug on publication.
So, that's good.

595
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:22,999
But we have an even bigger problem.

596
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:26,230
Celebrity readings. Dick Van Dyke!

597
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,510
I've been calling all morning,
but I can't get through.

598
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:28,710
Oh no.

599
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,750
I will get down there.
I will fix this. I will take care of this!

600
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:32,514
He won't read it.

601
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:35,600
You can count on me!

602
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:39,510
Oh, Abby, great. I need to borrow
your car. It's a work emergency.

603
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:42,670
I ride a bike, actually. It's good
exercise and good for the planet.

604
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:44,275
Just tell me where it is!

605
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:47,510
Dude, I've been looking
for you everywhere.

606
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:48,790
Have you heard about Philip Parker?

607
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:51,111
I don't wanna hear anything more
about his amazing party.

608
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,391
No. It's canceled.

609
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:54,070
What?

610
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,790
Yeah! He woke up with chicken pox.

611
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:57,230
He texted me this picture.

612
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:59,153
These things are everywhere.

613
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,800
They're even in his butt crack.

614
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:05,110
So, his party's not on?

615
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:06,950
No! So everyone's coming
to yours again!

616
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:08,950
- Really?
- Great, right?

617
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:10,475
His pox is your gain.

618
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:14,831
I gotta go. I gotta go.

619
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,311
Becky!

620
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:18,998
Becky, Becky. Wait, wait up.

621
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,511
Hi!

622
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:23,790
I am really sorry
about burning your binder yesterday.

623
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:26,070
Today's a new day,
and I thought that we could go ahead...

624
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:27,879
and sail our ships with positivity!

625
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:29,831
Okay.

626
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:33,270
Anyway, Philip Parker has chicken pox.

627
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:34,636
But my party's still on.

628
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:37,961
So if you want to swing by,
it's gonna be pretty cool.

629
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:40,750
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

630
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:44,590
I actually feel bad Philip's gonna miss
such a sweet party, but...

631
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:46,559
what can you do when you got the pox?

632
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:49,150
Okay, maybe.

633
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:52,110
Fantastic! Maybe I'll see you later then.

634
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,192
Okay. See you.

635
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:56,511
See you!

636
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:03,110
No.

637
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:07,441
Should I put more over here?

638
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:13,310
Hey, birthday boy!

639
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:14,670
<i>Nothing goofy, Dad.</i>

640
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:17,190
- What? Alexander?
- Yeah...

641
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:20,150
and we're gonna need enough food,
cake and drinks for 50 kids.

642
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:22,470
- Everyone's coming.
- Okay, okay. Hold on. Now hold on.

643
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:23,881
What are you talking about?

644
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:25,510
<i>Philip Parker has chicken pox.</i>

645
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,190
<i>- The Party's on!
- Hey!</i>

646
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:28,950
That's fantastic. I mean, for you.

647
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:31,990
<i>Yeah. And guess what? Elliot got
busted for text-bombing the school.</i>

648
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:35,230
So I took your advice
and steered my ship with positivity.

649
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:37,430
And now Becky Gibson
might be coming, too.

650
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:38,910
<i>So no magic tricks.</i>

651
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:40,990
No tap dancing, nothing dorky.

652
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:42,510
<i>- You got it.
- I'm</i> turning <i>12.</i>

653
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,991
Got it. 12-year-old cool straight up.

654
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:47,430
- Do it right now.
- It's just allergies.

655
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:48,550
Really?

656
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:50,075
Hey, Em. What's up?

657
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:53,670
They're making me miss dress rehearsal
to lay down in the infirmary.

658
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,590
And Anthony called me.

659
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:57,550
Celia broke up with him.

660
00:30:57,630 --> 00:30:58,961
They're going to prom tonight.

661
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:01,080
Apparently not anymore.

662
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:19,750
Can I be excused?

663
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:21,511
Yes.

664
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:29,110
What?

665
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:30,590
Listen...

666
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:32,390
I am sorry about last night.
You have to believe me.

667
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:34,313
I would never say
those things about you.

668
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:37,634
And tonight, I'm going
to make it up to you.

669
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:39,636
X-O-X-O.

670
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:41,151
I heart you.

671
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:46,792
Look, I just want
everything to be perfect tonight.

672
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:50,070
Please...

673
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:51,481
be my date for the prom.

674
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:53,750
This isn't <i>Gossip Girl,</i> you two.

675
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:54,911
Get back inside, Celia.

676
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:57,836
See you tonight.

677
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:06,791
Yes!

678
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:18,430
<i>Let's go, Wreck-It Ralph.</i>

679
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:20,670
Principal's office now!

680
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:22,470
Are you sure I can't just
drop him off with you?

681
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:24,110
Honey,
there's no way. Not today.

682
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:25,790
<i>What happened to the babysitter?</i>

683
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:27,550
Oh, she had to cancel again.

684
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:29,630
You know what? It's okay.
I'll just take him with me.

685
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:31,230
<i>You're taking Trevor to the interview?</i>

686
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,310
Yeah, I'll be fine.

687
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:34,110
<i>How's he doing without Bumble Bee?</i>

688
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:35,990
Um, he is...

689
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:38,190
He is hanging in there.
He's doing okay.

690
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:40,390
<i>Okay, honey.
I gotta go. I gotta go. Good luck!</i>

691
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:41,551
Thanks, you too, hon.

692
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:44,870
Hey, Anthony, what's up?

693
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:46,550
<i>Dad, I broke a trophy case
and got suspended.</i>

694
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:48,510
<i>- What?
- You have to come and pick me up.</i>

695
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:50,190
No! You gotta be kidding me.

696
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,550
<i>They say you need to come get me.</i>

697
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:53,430
No, no. You're gonna
have to wait at the Principal's

698
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:54,830
office till I'm done with my interview.

699
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:55,950
<i>Fine, I'll be here.</i>

700
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:57,361
Okay, bye.

701
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:15,957
On your left! I'm on your right!

702
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:18,114
On your right. On your left.

703
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:20,830
Are you okay?

704
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:21,911
I'm good. I got it!

705
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:23,760
I'm good. Don't worry!

706
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:30,990
Excuse me.

707
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:32,950
Mr. Van Dyke. Mr. Van Dyke!

708
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:35,430
I have been trying to reach you
because I'm here to save you.

709
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:37,350
I'm from the publishing company.

710
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:39,590
Let me start again. I'm not crazy.

711
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:40,670
Please welcome
legendary performer...

712
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:41,990
- No, no.
- That's my cue.

713
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:43,870
We'll have a little chat later, all right?

714
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:45,830
This is not something we should
leave until afterwards.

715
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:47,350
We wanna have
a chat right now, Mr. Van Dyke!

716
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:49,717
Please welcome Mr. Dick Van Dyke!

717
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:52,956
Please!

718
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:58,310
I insist that you get him.

719
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:00,030
And I insist you stay right there.

720
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:01,110
- Hi, kids!
- Sir!

721
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:02,430
And hi, moms and dads.

722
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:04,470
There was a misprint! Just two minutes!

723
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:06,590
If you guys don't know who I am,
ask your parents.

724
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:07,670
And if they don't know...

725
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:08,990
have them ask their parents.

726
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:12,950
We're gonna have a great time today.

727
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:15,030
- I'm gonna read to you.
- You're not gonna want to say-!

728
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:17,350
I'm gonna read from a very special book.

729
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:18,390
You ready?

730
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:20,199
Get out of my way. I need him. Sir!

731
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:23,670
"Today's the day. You're growing up!

732
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,115
"I'm here to help you...

733
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,550
take that dump!"

734
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:28,110
Please don't, sir!

735
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,954
"Take that dump in the pool!"

736
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:32,914
"Take that dump on the bed!"

737
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:37,595
"But, don't take a dump on your,
on your brother's head."

738
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:40,430
"You can take a dump like a frog."

739
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:42,638
"I'll take a big dump like a dog!"

740
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:44,790
No! It's "jump"!

741
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:47,191
It's just jump, sir. Not dump.

742
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:48,910
Would you excuse me for a moment?

743
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:50,150
I never agreed to do this kind of...

744
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,470
There was a misprint.

745
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:54,400
Jump like a frog. One little letter.

746
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:56,430
It was a mistake!
It was meant to be jump! I'm so sorry.

747
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:59,161
There she is, right there,
with the bad hair! She's behind this.

748
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:11,430
Okay, we got this. We got this, right?

749
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:13,830
You good? You cool? You ready?

750
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:16,197
You ready to nail this? All right.

751
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:35,870
Hey, man, guys are ready for you.

752
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:38,112
- Let's go.
- Oh, great, thank you.

753
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:41,270
At first we thought it was a little weird

754
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:42,390
that you even applied for this job...

755
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:45,917
because we're pretty young and you're...

756
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:47,390
Older.

757
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:48,470
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

758
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:49,631
Kind of decrepit.

759
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:51,590
But then we took a look at your resume,

760
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:53,081
and your experience is awesome.

761
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:55,872
You're part of
the space station design team.

762
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:58,990
You have a Ph.D.
in orbital mechanics. I mean, for real?

763
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,071
For real.

764
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:03,511
Sorry.

765
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:05,521
Hey, you.

766
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:08,358
He's a little out of sorts today.

767
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:13,190
It's so hard
to find the Bumble Bee pacifier.

768
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:16,310
It would blow your mind. Anyway...

769
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:17,870
Here you go.

770
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:19,830
He's just gonna play for a while.

771
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:22,277
And, kids are crazy.

772
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:23,910
They're fun.

773
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:24,990
Yeah.

774
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:26,790
So, what were we talking about?

775
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:28,390
We're thinking about
launching this game.

776
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:31,710
We want it to be a space station
simulation strategy game.

777
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:34,790
We want it to be authentic
and completely immersive.

778
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:36,670
That sounds really exciting.

779
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:38,190
That's in my wheelhouse.

780
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:39,840
Great! We wanna hear some ideas.

781
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,990
I guess my first idea would
be modular evolution.

782
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:43,350
Cool.

783
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:45,710
Space stations are not static.
They grow over time.

784
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:49,150
So you would want to start with
perhaps a small space station...

785
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:51,590
and grow it into
an enormous space station.

786
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:53,870
And I think players
should have that opportunity.

787
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:55,830
They could add greenhouses.

788
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:57,310
They could add labs.

789
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:58,915
They could grow a space station...

790
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,479
as big as their imagination.

791
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:04,110
...your kid.

792
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:05,750
You know what, that'll be fine.

793
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:08,110
Because we can get daycare,
so that won't be an issue.

794
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,590
No, no, no.

795
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:10,671
Your kid right now...

796
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:13,673
his face is all green.

797
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:16,832
Trev.

798
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:20,161
Trevor. I know.

799
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:21,871
That's not for eating.

800
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,270
Yoshi, what's up, man?

801
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:25,230
<i>Good news to report or what?</i>

802
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:28,070
Actually, we have
a Skype call we gotta take.

803
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:29,515
But we will call you back.

804
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:32,721
Okay. You'll call me back?

805
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,311
- Yeah.
- All right.

806
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:36,830
Great. All right, we'll head out.

807
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:38,036
You ready to go?

808
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:42,430
Anthony,

809
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:45,830
of all the days for you to get sent home,
it had to be today?

810
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:47,190
Dad, it was a freak accident!

811
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:48,510
Don't!

812
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:51,716
What happened to Trevor?

813
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:55,511
That's real mature, Dad.

814
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:01,591
Hey, Salamander.

815
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:02,836
Hey, Dad!

816
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:09,198
What happened to Trevor?

817
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:11,670
He ate a delicious
green marker for lunch.

818
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:13,710
- Why are you here?
- Shut up.

819
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:15,790
Em, I thought you had to stay
to get ready for your play.

820
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:16,870
I need drugs.

821
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:19,470
Real drugs. The nurse will
only give me baby aspirin.

822
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:20,830
What happened to Trevor?

823
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:23,590
Emily, we're not gonna pump you
full of medicine. You're not a cyclist.

824
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:26,590
I'm not asking for steroids.
I need cough syrup, something.

825
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,559
Wait, Dad! How was your interview?

826
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:30,390
It was not a good fit.

827
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:32,600
But, you know? We'll see what happens.

828
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:33,790
It was fine.

829
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:34,870
Try again next time.

830
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:35,950
- Hello.
- Hi, Mr. Brand.

831
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:38,310
I know she's not 100%, but...

832
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:40,550
as they say, the show must go on.

833
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:42,630
So, if you could get her back here
by 3:00 for hair and makeup...

834
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:43,711
that would be tremendous.

835
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,230
Em, you look terrible.

836
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:47,630
Maybe you should have
your understudy do it?

837
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:51,157
No! Nobody wears
those tights but me. Pharmacy, pronto!

838
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:53,760
Nobody wears the tights but her.

839
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:02,750
<i>Any available cashier to register two.</i>

840
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:04,390
Extra strength or regular?

841
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:06,030
What do you think?

842
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,710
Excuse me. Do you have
a Bumble Bee pacifier?

843
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:09,150
Does it have to be Bumble Bee?

844
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:10,270
It has to be the Bumble Bee.

845
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:11,670
Yes, because this ain't gonna last.

846
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:12,990
Thank you.

847
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:14,350
Hey, how'd the reading go?

848
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:15,990
<i>It could've gone better.</i>

849
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:17,910
<i>Honey, I'm sure it was great.</i>

850
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:19,071
Well...

851
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:23,391
<i>Well, you know what,
I'm sure it was not that bad, really.</i>

852
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:27,350
That girl with the awful hair, I think.

853
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:31,030
No, no. I thought, maybe... No, it's bad.

854
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:32,390
<i>It was bad. It was lose-my-job bad.</i>

855
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:33,830
Really?

856
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:36,750
Anthony, come on! No, please. Stop it.

857
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:38,230
- No, I'm just...
- Stop it!

858
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:39,950
What are you doing?
Why is Anthony with you?

859
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:41,475
He was suspended from school...

860
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:43,035
<i>for destroying school property.</i>

861
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:45,230
- What? What happened?
- It's fine.

862
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:46,670
It was an accident.
I'll tell you about it later.

863
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:49,190
Okay, so, Em is getting her cough syrup.

864
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:50,870
I'm taking Anthony to his driver's test.

865
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:52,590
And, good news!

866
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:54,910
50 kids are coming over tonight.
The party is on!

867
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:55,991
<i>Boy, this is...</i>

868
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:58,750
- Maybe I should meet you. I'm not far.
<i>- It's</i> fine!

869
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:01,550
Hon, I'm totally... Hold on.

870
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:03,430
No, we don't have one.

871
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:05,353
Daddy wishes he could swear right now.

872
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:07,197
Hey, question.

873
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:09,190
Permanent marker,
do you know if it's poisonous?

874
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:10,710
Because he might have ingested some.

875
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:11,950
What?

876
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:13,550
<i>- Ben!</i>
- Honey, honey...

877
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:14,830
- I'm coming!
- No, no, no! I'm good.

878
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:16,275
Tell Trevor Mama's on her way!

879
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:23,190
Nobody's home.

880
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:24,396
Call 'em, dude.

881
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:32,830
Anthony, are you sure
you're up for this today?

882
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:35,070
Dad, it's now or never.
I promised Celia.

883
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:38,510
All right. Well, anything worth
doing is worth doing well.

884
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:40,470
Try not to kill anybody.

885
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:44,315
Hello. Yeah.

886
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:48,470
I'm not gonna be back
for a while, so, the gate's open.

887
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:50,150
Just go in, start setting everything up.

888
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:51,510
<i>Are you sure you guys can handle this?</i>

889
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:53,310
Yeah, yeah, no problem.
We'll be ready to party.

890
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:54,390
<i>Okay-</i>

891
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:55,710
- Okay, great.
- See you later.

892
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:56,831
Thanks.

893
00:40:57,350 --> 00:40:59,670
- Let's do this.
- Yeah.

894
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:01,710
Emily, just the recommended
dosage, please.

895
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:02,870
That stuff's pretty strong.

896
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:04,710
Hi, guys.

897
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:05,990
Hey, there's Mama.

898
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:07,150
Why is my baby green?

899
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:08,510
Well, things went a little awry today.

900
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:09,590
Honey.

901
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:10,630
- Look who it is.
- Ben, he's green.

902
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:11,710
- I know.
- What is this?

903
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:14,830
It's marker. It's fine.
How did it go? How was the reading?

904
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:17,710
It was awful. I think I pretty much
flushed my career down the potty.

905
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:18,830
Why, what happened?

906
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:20,594
Never mind. Can I have the wipes?

907
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:24,390
- Dad!
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

908
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:26,350
I told you this day was cursed.

909
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:27,430
Sorry.

910
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:29,750
Cooper. Anthony Cooper.

911
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:30,910
- All right, wish me luck.
- Good luck, baby.

912
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:33,072
<i>- Here you go.
- Anthony Cooper.</i>

913
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:34,271
Wait, Anthony!

914
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:36,670
Please don't do it today.
You're gonna fail.

915
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:37,830
Alexander...

916
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:39,190
give your brother some space, please.

917
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:41,510
Yeah, the next time you see this face,
it's gonna be on my driver's license.

918
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:42,670
It's not coming off.

919
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,030
Just hurry up! I need to get to my play.

920
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:45,110
What kind of a person...

921
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:46,237
It's not poisonous.

922
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:49,040
I don't think it's poisonous.

923
00:41:58,470 --> 00:41:59,550
Hi, I'm Anthony. I'm really excited...

924
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:01,230
There are only two things
you need to know.

925
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:04,230
My name is Ms. Suggs
and I'll be your driving examiner.

926
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:07,190
Now, you may be
the big man on campus out there...

927
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:09,590
but in this minivan, I'm the B.M.O.C.

928
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:11,070
You get me?

929
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:15,075
Now put your hands at 10 and 2,
and show me what you can do.

930
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:17,678
Hi, Mom, how you doing?

931
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:21,230
How's your day going so far?

932
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:23,230
- Okay, I'm just gonna...
- What?

933
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:25,390
Just make this little call.

934
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:26,551
Okay.

935
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:31,235
Yeah, it's...

936
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:35,710
Cooper! Where are you?

937
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:37,910
<i>My family had a little situation, so...</i>

938
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:39,750
Really? That's funny.

939
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:42,790
Because we're having
a little bit of a situation here!

940
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:45,470
<i>The phones are going crazy.</i>

941
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:47,154
What happened at that reading?

942
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:49,150
Well, it was a really good crowd.

943
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:50,870
It was a big, big crowd. Big turnout.

944
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:54,990
And the parents seemed
to have a lot to say.

945
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:57,270
- They responded.
<i>- Did they?</i>

946
00:42:57,350 --> 00:43:01,030
Did they respond
to Dick Van Dyke asking their toddlers...

947
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:03,078
if they could take a dump like a dog?

948
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:05,638
<i>I thought I could count on you.</i>

949
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,354
We'll discuss this later.

950
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:10,198
I look forward to...
I look forward to that.

951
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:21,155
Tell me something, Anthony.
Are you a senior citizen?

952
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:23,161
No, ma'am.

953
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:25,830
Well, then why are you driving
15 miles an hour in a 25 mile zone?

954
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:26,911
Come on, speed it up.

955
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:31,911
That's right. That is right. Boy.

956
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:35,712
Change lanes.

957
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:44,270
Now, I want you to take a right up here.

958
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:52,512
All right. Okay.

959
00:43:58,350 --> 00:43:59,875
Celia's calling.

960
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:03,390
It's my girlfriend.
Probably wants to talk prom plans.

961
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:07,236
Tonight's the prom.
Well, I'll just ignore that.

962
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:10,760
It seems like
she's very anxious to talk to you.

963
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:13,230
No. No, no. I'm driving.

964
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:15,392
I would never answer
the phone when I'm driving.

965
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:16,630
No.

966
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:17,790
No matter what circumstance.

967
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:20,310
But, you know,
proms don't happen every day.

968
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:21,437
That's true.

969
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:24,710
You sure?
It'll just be super quick. It's not...

970
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:28,033
What's important to you
is important to me.

971
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:29,551
Right?

972
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:34,270
Hey, Celia.
I can't really talk right now, but...

973
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:37,190
- Put the phone down!
- What?

974
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:39,670
Put the mobile device down now!

975
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:40,831
Hey, eyes on the road!

976
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:43,241
No, no!

977
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:47,601
You're gonna kill us!

978
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:55,797
What is wrong with you?

979
00:44:57,990 --> 00:44:59,190
What are you doing?

980
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:03,400
What are you...
What are you doing? You fool!

981
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:09,275
You tricked me!

982
00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:10,756
Get outta this car.

983
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:13,030
- You get out of this car.
- You're evil!

984
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:14,441
You prom creep!

985
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:16,590
- I don't think he passed.
- Get out!

986
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:17,671
Get out!

987
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:39,436
This is your fault.

988
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:41,550
If you hadn't caused a fight
between me and Celia...

989
00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:42,630
I would've never picked up that call...

990
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:43,750
- and failed my test.
- No, no, no.

991
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:46,110
Anthony, you are
not passing the blame on this one.

992
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:48,590
I told you today might not be a good day
to take the test.

993
00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:49,950
Dad, I had to take the test today.

994
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:51,150
No, you didn't have
to take the test today.

995
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:52,710
It is all Alexander's fault.

996
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:54,790
If he hadn't dropped Trevor's
paci down the disposal...

997
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:57,521
I never would have
rehearsed in a cold car and gotten sick.

998
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:58,590
That's also your fault.

999
00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:00,550
If you hadn't
left the battery on in my car all night...

1000
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:01,590
I wouldn't have been late to work...

1001
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:03,270
and Dick Van Dyke
wouldn't be mad at me.

1002
00:46:03,350 --> 00:46:05,750
Chim Chiminey wants to kill me!
Can you imagine?

1003
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:08,750
Mom, Trevor was crying!
Where was I supposed to rehearse?

1004
00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:12,152
How were you able
to hit every parking meter on that street?

1005
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:13,870
When I was in the bathroom
this morning, Mom saw me naked!

1006
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:15,870
I don't think you left a speck of paint!

1007
00:46:15,950 --> 00:46:18,270
Her fault!
She's an evil woman.

1008
00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:20,921
Boom, boom, boom,
one right after the other.

1009
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:22,361
Stop, you guys!

1010
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:24,601
Okay, stop!

1011
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:27,630
It was my fault.

1012
00:46:27,710 --> 00:46:30,950
I'm to blame for all of it. For everything.

1013
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:32,430
Yeah, see? I told you.

1014
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:34,110
No, hold on, hold on.

1015
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:36,430
Alexander, what are you saying?

1016
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:37,470
Okay, look.

1017
00:46:37,550 --> 00:46:39,950
Last night I made
myself a birthday sundae

1018
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:41,590
and I made a wish on a candle...

1019
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:44,950
and I think I cursed this day
for all of you.

1020
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:46,630
- You did what?
- I'm sorry.

1021
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:47,950
I just wanted you guys
to know what it was like...

1022
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:50,830
to have a massively
horrible, terrible day.

1023
00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:52,710
So I wished it...

1024
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:54,394
and now you're all having one.

1025
00:46:55,510 --> 00:46:56,470
Alexander,
as incredible as it would be...

1026
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:58,630
for you to have
that kind of supernatural ability...

1027
00:46:58,710 --> 00:46:59,910
I don't think you can
actually curse a day, buddy.

1028
00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:02,150
Yeah, sweetie,
this isn't your fault.

1029
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:03,470
We just bit off
more than we could chew today...

1030
00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:04,670
and it isn't going our way.

1031
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:06,470
No, look, I did curse the day.

1032
00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:08,990
I don't know how,
but I did, and it worked.

1033
00:47:09,070 --> 00:47:10,670
And now Emily's gonna miss her play...

1034
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:13,401
and Anthony's not gonna be
able to drive Celia to the prom.

1035
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:16,670
He's been waiting all year to make out
with her in the back of the van.

1036
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:18,470
Okay, we don't need to hear that.

1037
00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:20,154
Okay, I'm sorry.

1038
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:22,554
I'm really sorry.

1039
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:25,870
Just forget my party.

1040
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:27,873
It'll be a disaster anyway.

1041
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:31,280
Apology not accepted.

1042
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:33,591
Look...

1043
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:39,550
this day is not ruined,
because this day is not over yet.

1044
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:40,995
Dad, you're so right.

1045
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:44,230
I may be sick, but there's no way
I'm missing opening night.

1046
00:47:44,310 --> 00:47:45,550
I may have wrecked the van...

1047
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:48,470
but I'm not missing prom
with Celia. I can't.

1048
00:47:48,550 --> 00:47:52,475
Look, we are not
going to let this day get the better of us.

1049
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:56,390
It's like last week at Target
when Dad lost Trevor for 45 minutes.

1050
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:57,550
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1051
00:47:57,630 --> 00:47:59,350
And the store manager
wanted to call the cops...

1052
00:47:59,430 --> 00:48:01,390
but Dad said, "No!"

1053
00:48:01,470 --> 00:48:03,110
- We found him.
- "We are gonna keep looking."

1054
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:04,190
We will keep looking for my baby?

1055
00:48:04,270 --> 00:48:05,430
"We will find my baby."

1056
00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:06,750
They sealed the doors. It was fine.

1057
00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:08,750
- What's wrong with you?
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1058
00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:09,950
Okay, guys, okay.

1059
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:11,910
It's past 3:00, so if we're gonna go,
we gotta do this now.

1060
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:13,150
Are we ready, Coopers?

1061
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:15,470
All right! Clap those hands
if you believe in fairies!

1062
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:17,120
Emily, are you okay?

1063
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:20,390
Mom! Positivism. Let's do this thing.

1064
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:21,870
Get in there, get in there.

1065
00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:23,839
- Buckle, buckle!
- Buckle, buckle!

1066
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:26,801
Go, go, go, go, go!

1067
00:48:27,870 --> 00:48:30,390
It seems we may
have accidentally given your tux away.

1068
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:31,550
Well, get it back.

1069
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:33,590
Sir, I cannot un-tux a client.

1070
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:35,790
My sister's Peter Pan
and we've got 10 minutes till curtain.

1071
00:48:35,870 --> 00:48:37,634
You better un-tux something.

1072
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:42,356
There is one option.
You might be able to pull it off.

1073
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:45,030
All right, fire up. Come on, let's go.

1074
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:01,356
Coopers on the move!

1075
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:02,511
We got it.

1076
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:04,394
All right. Anthony, find a seat.

1077
00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:06,671
Break a leg, Em.

1078
00:49:06,830 --> 00:49:07,877
I'm here!

1079
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:09,070
Get some more of this.

1080
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:10,151
Honey? Hon, hon.

1081
00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:14,432
Em. Em. Sweetie,
I think you've had plenty of that.

1082
00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:16,790
It's okay, honey.

1083
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:18,710
- Peter Pan is here, everybody!
- Excuse me, people.

1084
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:21,030
- Everybody, Peter's here!
- Excuse us, excuse us.

1085
00:49:21,110 --> 00:49:22,110
- You look so pretty.
- Superstar coming through.

1086
00:49:22,190 --> 00:49:23,150
Superstar

1087
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:24,670
Excuse me, everyone.

1088
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:25,751
All right.

1089
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:30,360
I love your outfit.

1090
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:31,951
Okay.

1091
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:35,150
I said 3:00.

1092
00:49:35,230 --> 00:49:37,710
You have no idea
the kind of day we are having.

1093
00:49:37,790 --> 00:49:38,790
It's a miracle we're here.

1094
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:40,950
Well, you're late,
which is not professional behavior.

1095
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:42,670
No! And it's not professional...

1096
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:44,710
because this is an eighth grade
production of <i>Peter</i> Pan.

1097
00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:47,590
And if you could take
one look at our minivan...

1098
00:49:47,670 --> 00:49:49,430
Mr. Brand, I am not somebody

1099
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:51,478
that you wanna mess with right now.

1100
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:54,110
So grab her some green tights
and a harness...

1101
00:49:54,190 --> 00:49:55,430
and fire up her Tinker Bell!

1102
00:49:55,510 --> 00:49:57,310
As soon as you
have your costumes on...

1103
00:49:57,390 --> 00:49:58,590
go for your hair.

1104
00:49:58,670 --> 00:49:59,830
Way to go, Daddy-O!

1105
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:01,430
- Break a leg, sweetie.
- Good luck!

1106
00:50:01,510 --> 00:50:04,030
Show's about to start, Emily.
We've got to get you going.

1107
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:15,070
Everything's under control.
Yeah. You okay?

1108
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:16,436
Yeah.

1109
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:23,470
- I'm excited about this.
- Yeah.

1110
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:24,590
It's gonna be great.

1111
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:25,671
Yeah, I think so.

1112
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:33,110
Good night, Mother.
Good night, Father.

1113
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:36,190
Now, you two be quiet
and I'll tell you a story.

1114
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:37,910
What sort of story?

1115
00:50:37,990 --> 00:50:39,350
The best sort.

1116
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:42,870
One filled with
magic and fairies and savage pirates...

1117
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:44,230
called Never Never Land.

1118
00:50:44,310 --> 00:50:45,755
Hi, hello!

1119
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:48,276
No!

1120
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:50,832
I'm a little boy
named Peter Pan!

1121
00:50:51,990 --> 00:50:53,630
- Hello! How are you?
- What's wrong with her?

1122
00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:54,790
It must be the cough syrup.

1123
00:50:54,870 --> 00:50:56,474
So good to see you.

1124
00:50:57,830 --> 00:50:59,798
Peter Pan is in the house!

1125
00:51:01,550 --> 00:51:02,790
<i>Think of</i> a <i>wonderful thought</i>

1126
00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:04,110
Get the hook and get her down!

1127
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:05,430
<i>Any merry little thought</i>

1128
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:07,550
- Oh, no!
- Hook her down! Hook her!

1129
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:08,750
I'm floating. I'm floating.

1130
00:51:08,830 --> 00:51:09,831
Get her!

1131
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:14,797
<i>Reindeer in the sky</i>

1132
00:51:15,310 --> 00:51:16,994
<i>Let go!</i>

1133
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:18,874
- Get her down!
- Let go of me!

1134
00:51:19,390 --> 00:51:20,630
Let go of me right now!

1135
00:51:21,390 --> 00:51:22,391
<i>Let go!</i>

1136
00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:25,831
<i>Everybody, fly!</i>

1137
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:35,350
She's okay. She's all right. There she is.

1138
00:51:36,190 --> 00:51:37,430
Ta-da!

1139
00:51:37,990 --> 00:51:40,270
Thank you, everybody. Thank you.

1140
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:42,790
Oh, my God, Josephine, hi!

1141
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:44,430
Daniel, hi!

1142
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:47,992
Hi! Hello, everybody.
Take some pixie dust!

1143
00:51:48,670 --> 00:51:51,355
Thank you, thank you!

1144
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:56,150
How much cough syrup did she have?

1145
00:51:56,230 --> 00:51:58,150
Clearly, way too much.

1146
00:51:58,230 --> 00:51:59,516
There she is.

1147
00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:02,360
- Hi!
- Hey, honey.

1148
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:11,560
Well, that was
an incredible thing to watch.

1149
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:15,350
I think I broke Captain Hook's nose.

1150
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:17,637
Sweetie, it's not your fault.

1151
00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:20,430
We shouldn't have let
you go out there today.

1152
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:22,710
No, you can't fool around
with medicine, hon.

1153
00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:23,830
Emily. Emily.

1154
00:52:23,910 --> 00:52:25,910
Dude, you crushed it!

1155
00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:27,958
I gotta change into my tux.

1156
00:52:28,830 --> 00:52:30,798
- Mr. Brand?
- Not now.

1157
00:52:31,670 --> 00:52:32,910
Can't speak.

1158
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:39,396
Honey, it's all going
to be okay. Trust me.

1159
00:52:40,910 --> 00:52:41,911
Love you, Dad.

1160
00:52:42,670 --> 00:52:43,910
Love you, too.

1161
00:52:48,590 --> 00:52:53,278
Okay, sweetie.
Okay, honey. That felt good.

1162
00:52:54,270 --> 00:52:55,390
You get that out.

1163
00:52:55,470 --> 00:52:56,550
Let's go outside and get you some air.

1164
00:52:56,630 --> 00:52:57,990
I'm sorry.

1165
00:52:58,070 --> 00:52:59,670
No, honey, it's fine.

1166
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:01,240
- Okay.
- It's fine.

1167
00:53:04,830 --> 00:53:06,992
When did she start eating carrots?

1168
00:53:08,590 --> 00:53:12,197
Your sister has excellent aim.

1169
00:53:13,310 --> 00:53:14,311
Can I have another towel?

1170
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:16,320
Thanks. Oh, man.

1171
00:53:20,190 --> 00:53:21,430
Hello?

1172
00:53:22,350 --> 00:53:23,636
Hey, Greg.

1173
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:26,794
No, now's a fine time.

1174
00:53:27,790 --> 00:53:29,030
You did?

1175
00:53:29,870 --> 00:53:32,794
No, I'm not surprised.
I thought it was a killer interview also.

1176
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:39,430
You wanna meet? Okay.

1177
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:41,430
Well, now actually
isn't a really good time.

1178
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:43,390
No. No, no, no.

1179
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:44,870
- Go, go, go!
- Drinks at Nagamaki?

1180
00:53:44,950 --> 00:53:46,550
- Go!
- Could you hold on a second, Greg?

1181
00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:48,590
Alexander, I appreciate
what you're trying to do...

1182
00:53:48,670 --> 00:53:50,230
but our plate is full.

1183
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:52,390
We got too much
going on tonight, kiddo.

1184
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:54,590
Dad, curse or no curse...

1185
00:53:54,670 --> 00:53:56,195
just go for it!

1186
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:02,110
Greg, we're gonna go for it.

1187
00:54:02,190 --> 00:54:04,630
Yeah, I will see you
at Nagamaki later, okay?

1188
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:09,230
Okay. Good. I look forward to it.
Thanks. Bye-bye.

1189
00:54:09,310 --> 00:54:10,270
Awesome!

1190
00:54:10,350 --> 00:54:12,790
Okay. I reek.

1191
00:54:12,870 --> 00:54:15,910
You do. Oh, look. Wait.

1192
00:54:15,990 --> 00:54:17,401
This looks like your size.

1193
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:20,590
I'm not going to wear a pirate blouse.

1194
00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:23,435
Pirate or puke, your choice.

1195
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:31,840
It's okay, Em.

1196
00:54:32,710 --> 00:54:36,510
It took a lot of courage
to fly out on that stage tonight.

1197
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:41,841
Do you have any idea
how proud we are of you?

1198
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:45,352
You've always just
put yourself out there.

1199
00:54:45,510 --> 00:54:47,274
You are fearless.

1200
00:54:48,030 --> 00:54:50,110
You're willing
to show the world who you really are.

1201
00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:52,033
That's amazing.

1202
00:54:54,350 --> 00:54:56,430
But if you're ever
about to take the stage on Broadway...

1203
00:54:56,510 --> 00:54:59,630
and you decide to drink
a bottle of cough syrup, give me a call.

1204
00:54:59,710 --> 00:55:01,041
Let me talk you out of it.

1205
00:55:01,350 --> 00:55:04,559
Ladies, care to do some pillaging?

1206
00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:10,954
Okay. All right.

1207
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:39,470
All right, how did I end up blue?

1208
00:55:39,550 --> 00:55:40,830
Celia's gonna love it.

1209
00:55:40,910 --> 00:55:42,310
It's totally retro.

1210
00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:43,391
Just own it, kiddo.

1211
00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:46,275
You look ridiculous.

1212
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:51,073
Go get your Duchess, Duke.

1213
00:55:55,270 --> 00:55:56,760
My little boy...

1214
00:55:57,750 --> 00:55:59,479
in a tuxedo, going to prom...

1215
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:02,274
in sneakers.

1216
00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:15,157
You look amazing.

1217
00:56:15,590 --> 00:56:18,799
What are you wearing?
You look like Willy Wonka.

1218
00:56:19,670 --> 00:56:21,081
I'm trying something different.

1219
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:27,481
What's going on?

1220
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:32,677
Yeah, I kind of failed my driver's test.

1221
00:56:34,470 --> 00:56:35,471
Oops.

1222
00:56:52,590 --> 00:56:54,001
You look beautiful, Celia.

1223
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:56,070
'Course I do.

1224
00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:57,356
Yeah, that's a sick dress.

1225
00:56:58,270 --> 00:57:00,630
I hope this isn't
too much wind for you, Celia.

1226
00:57:00,710 --> 00:57:03,031
It's actually helping
with the vomit smell.

1227
00:57:09,150 --> 00:57:10,590
So is everybody hungry?

1228
00:57:10,670 --> 00:57:12,430
- I am.
- I am.

1229
00:57:12,510 --> 00:57:13,590
They're coming to dinner?

1230
00:57:13,670 --> 00:57:15,672
Don't worry.
They're not gonna sit at our table.

1231
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:18,795
- How about some music?
- Yes. Yes.

1232
00:57:22,190 --> 00:57:24,477
No surprise, the radio's broken.

1233
00:57:57,710 --> 00:58:00,554
This is just something
that we do for fun sometimes.

1234
00:58:04,190 --> 00:58:05,874
Figured it'd make you laugh.

1235
00:58:11,390 --> 00:58:12,990
We're going to Nagamaki!

1236
00:58:13,070 --> 00:58:14,830
What? Are you kidding me?

1237
00:58:14,910 --> 00:58:16,870
- Nagamaki!
- They cook it on the table.

1238
00:58:16,950 --> 00:58:18,470
They cook it right on the table.

1239
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:20,075
Like a fondue, but not.

1240
00:58:20,870 --> 00:58:23,191
Supposed to be
a very authentic Japanese restaurant.

1241
00:58:35,230 --> 00:58:36,510
- Be careful.
- Yes, sir.

1242
00:58:36,590 --> 00:58:37,751
Thank you.

1243
00:58:39,150 --> 00:58:41,430
Konnichiwa. Welcome to Nagamaki!

1244
00:58:41,510 --> 00:58:42,590
Table for two, please.

1245
00:58:42,670 --> 00:58:43,751
Right this way.

1246
00:58:45,710 --> 00:58:46,711
There they are.

1247
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:49,151
You okay?

1248
00:58:49,430 --> 00:58:50,431
Yeah.

1249
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:54,510
Honey, come on.
Ben, you're the smartest guy I know.

1250
00:58:54,590 --> 00:58:57,116
You're literally a rocket scientist.
You've got these guys.

1251
00:58:58,430 --> 00:59:00,080
Is it better tucked in?

1252
00:59:01,950 --> 00:59:03,710
You hesitated. Here we go.

1253
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:05,230
- Go get them, buccaneer.
- Thanks. Bye.

1254
00:59:05,310 --> 00:59:07,677
- Good luck.
- Good luck, good luck.

1255
00:59:10,790 --> 00:59:11,791
Hey, fellas.

1256
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:16,479
Is that a pirate's blouse?

1257
00:59:18,590 --> 00:59:19,591
Yaar!

1258
00:59:23,470 --> 00:59:25,030
Yes, it be!

1259
00:59:25,110 --> 00:59:26,271
Yaar-some!

1260
00:59:26,670 --> 00:59:28,479
Climb aboard, matey!

1261
00:59:29,310 --> 00:59:30,390
How's he doing?

1262
00:59:30,470 --> 00:59:31,830
He looks like he's having fun.

1263
00:59:31,910 --> 00:59:32,870
He does?

1264
00:59:32,950 --> 00:59:34,230
They look impressed.

1265
00:59:34,310 --> 00:59:35,470
Oh, good.

1266
00:59:35,550 --> 00:59:38,793
That is exactly what I am talking about.
You have multi-players...

1267
00:59:38,910 --> 00:59:40,390
<i>Survivor-style.</i>

1268
00:59:40,470 --> 00:59:41,910
It's Survivor on a space station.

1269
00:59:41,990 --> 00:59:43,230
That's so cool. Multi-player.
What do you think?

1270
00:59:43,310 --> 00:59:44,750
- Yoshi's gonna flip.
- It would be sick.

1271
00:59:44,830 --> 00:59:45,991
To Ben.

1272
00:59:46,510 --> 00:59:47,710
The space pirates.

1273
00:59:47,790 --> 00:59:49,030
- Space pirates.
- Space pirate.

1274
00:59:56,470 --> 00:59:58,518
Are you sure you're not adopted?

1275
00:59:59,830 --> 01:00:01,950
You should try a shrimp.
They're really good.

1276
01:00:02,030 --> 01:00:03,191
I'm allergic to shrimp.

1277
01:00:03,990 --> 01:00:06,152
You should know
what your girlfriend's allergic to.

1278
01:00:07,350 --> 01:00:08,476
Yeah, sorry.

1279
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:11,036
X-O-X-O?

1280
01:00:12,390 --> 01:00:15,630
Anthony, I just can't believe, on the most
important night of our lives...

1281
01:00:15,710 --> 01:00:18,030
you brought me to a place
where I have to watch my food...

1282
01:00:18,110 --> 01:00:19,590
get cooked in front of me.

1283
01:00:19,670 --> 01:00:21,320
Who goes to Nagamaki
before the prom?

1284
01:00:22,230 --> 01:00:23,720
It's so amazing, okay?

1285
01:00:23,830 --> 01:00:26,190
Look! It's Hope and Dale
and Heather and Dave!

1286
01:00:26,270 --> 01:00:28,230
Hey, guys-.

1287
01:00:28,310 --> 01:00:30,074
Hey, Celia. What's up, Anthony?

1288
01:00:31,630 --> 01:00:33,190
O-M-G! You look beautiful.

1289
01:00:33,270 --> 01:00:34,750
- Love it.
- Thanks.

1290
01:00:34,830 --> 01:00:36,550
Don't you guys just love this place?

1291
01:00:36,630 --> 01:00:37,916
Totally. I die for it.

1292
01:00:38,350 --> 01:00:41,190
Oh, my God, me too.
I'll catch you guys later?

1293
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:42,351
Okay.

1294
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:47,751
Space pirate!
Space pirate! Space pirate!

1295
01:00:54,630 --> 01:00:56,519
Sake bomb!

1296
01:00:57,990 --> 01:00:59,754
It sounds like it couldn't be going better.

1297
01:01:01,230 --> 01:01:03,517
Chef Ananda! Shrimp me.

1298
01:01:08,510 --> 01:01:09,470
You ready?

1299
01:01:09,550 --> 01:01:10,756
Yeah, I'm ready.

1300
01:01:14,950 --> 01:01:16,156
One! That was one.

1301
01:01:16,830 --> 01:01:17,910
Yeah!

1302
01:01:17,990 --> 01:01:18,991
Fire it up!

1303
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:20,711
Three!

1304
01:01:21,230 --> 01:01:22,230
Four!

1305
01:01:22,310 --> 01:01:23,311
Keep it going.

1306
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:24,911
Five!

1307
01:01:25,630 --> 01:01:26,711
Six!

1308
01:01:27,870 --> 01:01:28,951
Seven!

1309
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:30,911
Eight!

1310
01:01:31,950 --> 01:01:33,236
Nine!

1311
01:01:34,270 --> 01:01:35,271
Ten!

1312
01:01:48,310 --> 01:01:49,510
Mom, Dad's on fire!

1313
01:01:49,590 --> 01:01:50,550
<i>I</i> hope so!

1314
01:01:50,630 --> 01:01:52,234
No, no, no. He's really on fire!

1315
01:01:54,470 --> 01:01:56,040
Drop and roll, Ben. Drop and roll.

1316
01:01:56,310 --> 01:01:57,311
Drop and roll!

1317
01:01:58,070 --> 01:01:59,150
Stop, drop and roll, honey.

1318
01:01:59,230 --> 01:02:00,231
Dad?

1319
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:20,795
I still have me arms!

1320
01:02:35,470 --> 01:02:36,881
Thank you for your time.

1321
01:02:42,110 --> 01:02:46,750
Nice job, you really nailed it.
Really nailed it, Ben!

1322
01:02:46,830 --> 01:02:50,391
You know who you are?
You're the flaming pirate of Nagamaki!

1323
01:02:52,150 --> 01:02:53,800
Thank you!

1324
01:02:54,190 --> 01:02:55,874
- Dad!
- Hey, guys.

1325
01:02:56,510 --> 01:02:57,591
Are you okay?

1326
01:02:57,910 --> 01:03:00,595
Yeah! I'm good.

1327
01:03:01,190 --> 01:03:02,840
I'm fine.

1328
01:03:06,270 --> 01:03:07,431
It's all good.

1329
01:03:09,390 --> 01:03:10,391
It's all good.

1330
01:03:13,270 --> 01:03:14,310
Dad...

1331
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:17,830
you don't always
have to steer your ship with positivity!

1332
01:03:17,910 --> 01:03:20,270
You keep us up
and we really appreciate it.

1333
01:03:20,350 --> 01:03:22,637
But some days are just bad.

1334
01:03:23,710 --> 01:03:25,075
Nothing can fix it.

1335
01:03:26,190 --> 01:03:27,191
Trust me.

1336
01:03:27,950 --> 01:03:28,997
I would know.

1337
01:03:29,990 --> 01:03:31,640
At least we're all together now.

1338
01:03:35,950 --> 01:03:37,634
It's my job to take care of you guys.

1339
01:03:40,310 --> 01:03:42,074
And, make sure
you don't have bad days.

1340
01:03:42,630 --> 01:03:45,281
- And when you do, it's on me!
- Ben.

1341
01:03:45,870 --> 01:03:46,951
I think that you just...

1342
01:03:47,270 --> 01:03:51,719
got to have the bad days so you can
love the good days even more.

1343
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:56,558
This day has been terrible!

1344
01:03:57,750 --> 01:03:58,911
Terrible day.

1345
01:03:59,750 --> 01:04:01,400
Yeah! A horrible day!

1346
01:04:02,670 --> 01:04:03,956
A no-good...

1347
01:04:05,390 --> 01:04:06,676
Very bad day!

1348
01:04:12,510 --> 01:04:14,035
You know what I think?

1349
01:04:14,870 --> 01:04:17,510
I think this day sucks!

1350
01:04:17,590 --> 01:04:18,630
Yes! It does.

1351
01:04:18,710 --> 01:04:19,711
Thank you!

1352
01:04:21,590 --> 01:04:23,190
I love you guys.

1353
01:04:23,270 --> 01:04:24,271
Come here.

1354
01:04:28,270 --> 01:04:29,476
Can't breathe!

1355
01:04:29,830 --> 01:04:31,510
- You sure?
- Yeah, totally. Come with us.

1356
01:04:31,590 --> 01:04:34,710
Okay, cool. All right, so, good news.
They have room...

1357
01:04:34,790 --> 01:04:36,230
and they said we could go with them.

1358
01:04:40,110 --> 01:04:41,191
I don't know.

1359
01:04:42,470 --> 01:04:43,790
What do you mean, you don't know?

1360
01:04:44,310 --> 01:04:47,519
We're not going in some busted-up
minivan with your crazy family.

1361
01:04:50,150 --> 01:04:51,390
You know what, go without me.

1362
01:04:52,630 --> 01:04:53,711
Excuse me?

1363
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:56,357
You want me to go
to the prom without you?

1364
01:04:56,870 --> 01:04:58,838
Yes. That's what I want.

1365
01:04:59,470 --> 01:05:00,995
I'm sticking with my family tonight.

1366
01:05:01,670 --> 01:05:03,957
You're choosing them over me?

1367
01:05:05,350 --> 01:05:07,190
Yes, Celia. I am.

1368
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:08,430
Because they're my family.

1369
01:05:08,510 --> 01:05:10,791
And if they're crazy,
then I guess it makes me crazy, too.

1370
01:05:12,030 --> 01:05:13,680
Have fun at the prom, Duchess.

1371
01:05:15,310 --> 01:05:16,641
What are you doing?

1372
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:19,720
Forget it.

1373
01:05:20,870 --> 01:05:22,201
So, what? No prom?

1374
01:05:22,950 --> 01:05:25,271
It's junior prom. The real one's next year.

1375
01:05:25,790 --> 01:05:27,280
What about Celia?

1376
01:05:28,150 --> 01:05:30,801
I realized there's
more important things than Celia.

1377
01:05:31,990 --> 01:05:33,992
- You sure?
- Very.

1378
01:05:34,270 --> 01:05:35,430
Good to have you on board.

1379
01:05:35,510 --> 01:05:36,511
Thanks, Dad.

1380
01:05:39,710 --> 01:05:40,757
What was that for?

1381
01:05:41,190 --> 01:05:42,670
I didn't wish you happy birthday yet.

1382
01:05:55,190 --> 01:05:57,950
<i>When there's</i>
a <i>smile in your heart</i>

1383
01:05:58,030 --> 01:06:00,950
<i>There's no better way to start</i>

1384
01:06:01,030 --> 01:06:04,790
<i>Think of all the joy you'll find</i>

1385
01:06:04,870 --> 01:06:07,191
<i>When you leave your past behind</i>

1386
01:06:35,550 --> 01:06:36,670
How did he get in there?

1387
01:06:36,750 --> 01:06:38,036
It's okay.

1388
01:06:41,150 --> 01:06:42,390
Dad, be careful.

1389
01:06:48,430 --> 01:06:50,000
There it goes.

1390
01:06:50,430 --> 01:06:51,556
It's okay.

1391
01:06:52,510 --> 01:06:53,716
Stay behind me.

1392
01:07:05,670 --> 01:07:07,479
Guys, there is a kangaroo out there.

1393
01:07:09,310 --> 01:07:10,471
And an emu.

1394
01:07:10,750 --> 01:07:12,434
And a cockatoo.

1395
01:07:12,830 --> 01:07:14,514
And a wallaby.

1396
01:07:15,190 --> 01:07:17,030
You really know your animals.

1397
01:07:17,110 --> 01:07:19,350
Yeah, they're all Australian.
What's going on?

1398
01:07:19,430 --> 01:07:22,030
I don't think they were
meant to be presented in quite this way.

1399
01:07:22,110 --> 01:07:23,316
- No.
- Hi!

1400
01:07:23,950 --> 01:07:25,236
You must be the Coopers.

1401
01:07:25,630 --> 01:07:28,750
Hey, yeah!
This was supposed to be a petting zoo?

1402
01:07:28,830 --> 01:07:31,037
A confined Australian petting zoo.

1403
01:07:31,470 --> 01:07:33,990
Yeah, it is. One of the pens was
open and the kangaroo got out.

1404
01:07:34,070 --> 01:07:35,710
Oh, yeah, the kangaroo.

1405
01:07:35,790 --> 01:07:37,838
There was also a crocodile
in our entry hall.

1406
01:07:38,790 --> 01:07:40,390
So sorry about that.

1407
01:07:40,470 --> 01:07:42,550
We had him in the pool,
and we got distracted.

1408
01:07:42,630 --> 01:07:44,910
You don't have to worry about it.
I'll put him back in the pen.

1409
01:07:44,990 --> 01:07:46,430
Okay, you got him from here on out?

1410
01:07:46,510 --> 01:07:48,270
- Yeah!
- Okay, great. Thanks.

1411
01:07:48,350 --> 01:07:49,476
We got you, Mr. Cooper.

1412
01:07:49,990 --> 01:07:51,350
- It'll be fine, right?
- Yeah.

1413
01:07:51,430 --> 01:07:52,790
- I don't think he's gonna get out again.
- No.

1414
01:07:52,870 --> 01:07:54,634
You guys did all of this for me?

1415
01:07:55,150 --> 01:07:58,677
Yeah! Your mom and I thought you
might enjoy a night in the Outback.

1416
01:08:02,830 --> 01:08:04,161
You can pet him if you want.

1417
01:08:04,510 --> 01:08:05,557
His name's Winston.

1418
01:08:06,270 --> 01:08:07,271
Hello, Winston.

1419
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:16,001
This is amazing.

1420
01:08:16,750 --> 01:08:19,470
Okay, guys?
We've got guests coming any minute.

1421
01:08:19,550 --> 01:08:21,030
So here's what we have to do.

1422
01:08:21,110 --> 01:08:23,750
Emily, you're on music.
Anthony, fire up the barbie.

1423
01:08:23,830 --> 01:08:25,550
Mom, snacks.

1424
01:08:25,630 --> 01:08:27,070
Alexander, why don't
you help Mom keep

1425
01:08:27,150 --> 01:08:28,750
Trevor away from
anything that will eat him?

1426
01:08:28,830 --> 01:08:30,750
Baby safety. 10-4.

1427
01:08:30,830 --> 01:08:32,310
I think we're all good now.

1428
01:08:32,390 --> 01:08:33,470
Super Coopers!

1429
01:08:33,550 --> 01:08:34,550
Super Coopers!

1430
01:08:34,630 --> 01:08:36,350
Lenny! Get back here.

1431
01:08:36,430 --> 01:08:37,636
Lenny! Someone get him!

1432
01:08:38,150 --> 01:08:39,710
- I am on it!
- Ben!

1433
01:08:39,790 --> 01:08:41,150
Lenny!

1434
01:08:41,230 --> 01:08:42,310
- Ben!
- Dad?

1435
01:08:42,390 --> 01:08:43,491
Lenny!

1436
01:08:53,230 --> 01:08:54,231
Okay!

1437
01:09:06,030 --> 01:09:07,395
That was pretty good!

1438
01:09:13,590 --> 01:09:14,876
Where are you?

1439
01:09:16,910 --> 01:09:18,116
Where are you?

1440
01:09:30,110 --> 01:09:31,236
Hey!

1441
01:09:31,910 --> 01:09:33,241
Hey there...

1442
01:09:33,550 --> 01:09:34,915
Party kangaroo.

1443
01:09:35,950 --> 01:09:36,951
I'm Ben...

1444
01:09:37,390 --> 01:09:40,830
and I want you to join me...

1445
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:42,116
back at the party.

1446
01:09:46,630 --> 01:09:47,670
Yeah!

1447
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:49,110
Nice work, Mr. Cooper.

1448
01:09:49,190 --> 01:09:50,190
Thank you, Dwayne.

1449
01:09:50,270 --> 01:09:52,079
Come here, Lenny. Here we go.

1450
01:09:57,470 --> 01:09:58,801
What's up, man?

1451
01:10:01,430 --> 01:10:02,670
Pretty cool, huh?

1452
01:10:02,750 --> 01:10:04,479
This party's gonna be killer, dude.

1453
01:10:04,790 --> 01:10:05,791
Hey, guys!

1454
01:10:06,590 --> 01:10:08,240
Your dad is hardcore!

1455
01:10:30,470 --> 01:10:31,835
Dude, did you see that?

1456
01:10:36,950 --> 01:10:38,550
- Hey! Hey!
- G'day.

1457
01:10:38,630 --> 01:10:40,390
You must be my Australian cowboys.

1458
01:10:40,470 --> 01:10:42,230
- We sure are.
- Awesome!

1459
01:10:42,310 --> 01:10:45,041
You guys are in good shape.

1460
01:10:53,950 --> 01:10:55,156
Hey, Nina, how are you?

1461
01:10:57,030 --> 01:10:58,475
It's the video game guys!

1462
01:11:01,110 --> 01:11:02,590
- Yeah.
- No, it's a great time to talk.

1463
01:11:02,670 --> 01:11:05,630
No. Just a little bit of the hair
was singed.

1464
01:11:05,710 --> 01:11:08,310
- Really?
- I know.

1465
01:11:08,390 --> 01:11:09,835
I know that was a lot of shrimp!

1466
01:11:12,910 --> 01:11:13,911
Dude!

1467
01:11:18,390 --> 01:11:19,391
Hey, you came!

1468
01:11:20,150 --> 01:11:21,390
Happy birthday!

1469
01:11:23,710 --> 01:11:24,871
This looks amazing!

1470
01:11:24,990 --> 01:11:26,640
Yeah, thanks.

1471
01:11:28,910 --> 01:11:31,481
Look, this has been
a really, really crazy day.

1472
01:11:32,390 --> 01:11:34,199
Looks like it turned out
pretty good to me.

1473
01:11:34,550 --> 01:11:35,551
Yeah.

1474
01:11:37,390 --> 01:11:38,790
Have a good weekend, Nina...

1475
01:11:38,870 --> 01:11:40,070
Have a good weekend, Greg.

1476
01:11:40,150 --> 01:11:41,910
- And thank you for everything.
- Thank you for your call.

1477
01:11:41,990 --> 01:11:42,991
Thanks.

1478
01:11:46,630 --> 01:11:48,155
How are you? How was that call?

1479
01:11:49,030 --> 01:11:50,680
It was great. I got the job!

1480
01:11:51,350 --> 01:11:52,636
- You got the job?
- Yeah.

1481
01:11:53,190 --> 01:11:54,470
It's fantastic!

1482
01:11:54,550 --> 01:11:56,430
They thought I was fun!

1483
01:11:56,510 --> 01:11:57,470
Even after you singed your arms...

1484
01:11:57,550 --> 01:11:59,150
Even after the thing and the thing.

1485
01:11:59,230 --> 01:12:00,470
"I still have me arms"?

1486
01:12:00,550 --> 01:12:02,712
I was a fiery pirate! They loved it!

1487
01:12:05,830 --> 01:12:07,320
You know what the best thing is?

1488
01:12:07,710 --> 01:12:09,470
As long as I'm getting the work done...

1489
01:12:09,550 --> 01:12:11,270
I can make my own hours.

1490
01:12:11,350 --> 01:12:14,240
I'll be able to still do carpool
and see the kids all the time.

1491
01:12:15,030 --> 01:12:17,110
I am so happy for you.

1492
01:12:17,190 --> 01:12:20,150
What about you?
What about your call? How did it go?

1493
01:12:20,230 --> 01:12:22,430
Dick Van Dyke's reading went viral.

1494
01:12:22,510 --> 01:12:24,035
500,000 hits today.

1495
01:12:24,390 --> 01:12:25,710
You're kidding me.

1496
01:12:25,790 --> 01:12:27,630
Nina says the book
is gonna be huge.

1497
01:12:27,710 --> 01:12:29,030
That is fantastic, sweetie!

1498
01:12:29,110 --> 01:12:30,110
Yeah...

1499
01:12:30,190 --> 01:12:31,351
it's great!

1500
01:12:42,110 --> 01:12:44,761
I cannot believe
we pulled this party off.

1501
01:12:45,390 --> 01:12:47,279
We really turned this day around.

1502
01:12:55,070 --> 01:12:56,151
What's that?

1503
01:13:02,510 --> 01:13:03,511
What are they doing?

1504
01:13:07,390 --> 01:13:09,150
That's the Thunder from Down Under.

1505
01:13:09,230 --> 01:13:11,070
They're supposed to be
authentic Australian cowboys.

1506
01:13:11,150 --> 01:13:12,151
They're not.

1507
01:13:12,590 --> 01:13:13,637
No, no, no!

1508
01:13:13,950 --> 01:13:15,710
Guys? Guys, PG!

1509
01:13:15,790 --> 01:13:17,121
PG! Keep it PG!

1510
01:13:17,470 --> 01:13:18,710
Please!

1511
01:13:19,910 --> 01:13:21,480
Oh, no.

1512
01:13:53,150 --> 01:13:56,996
Go, Alex!
Go, Alex! Go, Alex! Go, Alex!

1513
01:14:04,350 --> 01:14:10,430
<i>Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you</i>

1514
01:14:10,510 --> 01:14:12,430
<i>After today, I know that...</i>

1515
01:14:12,510 --> 01:14:14,510
<i>even terrible days aren't so bad</i>

1516
01:14:14,590 --> 01:14:16,513
<i>when you're surrounded
by the people you love.</i>

1517
01:14:16,990 --> 01:14:18,110
Make a wish, kiddo.

1518
01:14:18,190 --> 01:14:19,310
<i>Because it turns out...</i>

1519
01:14:19,390 --> 01:14:20,830
<i>the worse things</i> are...

1520
01:14:20,910 --> 01:14:22,560
<i>the better this family gets.</i>

1521
01:14:23,030 --> 01:14:24,316
To more days like this.

1522
01:14:24,510 --> 01:14:25,470
No!

1523
01:14:25,550 --> 01:14:27,430
- What are you talking about?
- Okay, okay.

1524
01:14:27,510 --> 01:14:29,630
<i>For us, this bad</i> day...

1525
01:14:29,710 --> 01:14:31,155
<i>was the best day ever!</i>
