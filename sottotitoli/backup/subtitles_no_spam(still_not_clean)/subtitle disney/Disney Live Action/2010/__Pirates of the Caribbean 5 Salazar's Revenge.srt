1
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,680
FATHER'S CURSE.

2
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,770
DEAD or ALIVE.

3
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,720
THE FLYING DUTCHMAN.

4
00:03:34,622 --> 00:03:38,459
- Father.
- Henry. What've you done?

5
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:42,463
- I said I'd find you.
- Look at me, son.

6
00:03:45,468 --> 00:03:46,468
I don't care.

7
00:03:46,469 --> 00:03:49,095
There's no place for
you on the Dutchman.

8
00:03:53,016 --> 00:03:56,185
They know you're here...
Get home to your mother.

9
00:03:56,227 --> 00:03:57,228
No.

10
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:01,024
- Leave now, before it's too late.
- I won't.

11
00:04:01,357 --> 00:04:04,235
I'll never stop... And
if you throw me over,

12
00:04:04,569 --> 00:04:06,362
I'll come straight back.

13
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:09,657
Don't you see, I'm
cursed to this ship?

14
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:10,825
That's why I'm here.

15
00:04:10,992 --> 00:04:12,911
I think I know a way
to break your curse.

16
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:14,329
To free you from the Dutchman.

17
00:04:14,412 --> 00:04:16,956
- Henry, no.
- I've read about a treasure.

18
00:04:16,998 --> 00:04:19,417
A treasure that holds all
the power of the sea,

19
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,543
The Trident of Poseidon

20
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:22,253
can break your curse.

21
00:04:25,381 --> 00:04:26,591
Henry.

22
00:04:27,717 --> 00:04:29,719
The Trident can never be found.

23
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,804
I found you.

24
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,516
- It's just a tale.
- Like the tales of you.

25
00:04:35,558 --> 00:04:37,060
And Captain Jack Sparrow?

26
00:04:37,101 --> 00:04:38,770
He will help me find the Trident.

27
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:40,355
You stay away from Jack.

28
00:04:40,939 --> 00:04:43,983
Leave the sea forever. You
have to stop acting like a...

29
00:04:44,025 --> 00:04:46,527
A pirate. I won't stop.

30
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,988
I want you to come home.

31
00:04:56,287 --> 00:04:57,413
Henry.

32
00:04:58,373 --> 00:04:59,624
I'm sorry.

33
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:03,336
My curse will never be broken.

34
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:07,423
This is my fate.

35
00:05:08,216 --> 00:05:10,093
You must let me go.

36
00:05:16,933 --> 00:05:18,309
I love you son.

37
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:48,298
Captain Jack Sparrow.

38
00:05:52,093 --> 00:05:56,598
Nine years later.

39
00:06:13,031 --> 00:06:17,202
Faster, you pathetic bilge
rats, you'll pump the bilge,

40
00:06:17,285 --> 00:06:18,828
and fill the scuppers.

41
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:21,164
We're chasing down pirates.

42
00:06:21,206 --> 00:06:24,792
Henry get back here. You don't
wanna get kicked off another ship.

43
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:28,296
It's a Dutch barque. Probably
stolen by the Pirate Bonet.

44
00:06:37,513 --> 00:06:38,848
My God.

45
00:06:39,349 --> 00:06:41,226
I warned you of leaving
your post, boy.

46
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:42,434
I need to speak with the captain.

47
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:43,853
- What did you say?
- Move.

48
00:06:44,553 --> 00:06:45,553
Turner.

49
00:06:52,237 --> 00:06:53,696
She's going in, sir.

50
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:56,574
Chase her down.

51
00:07:00,411 --> 00:07:02,038
No, don't do it.

52
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:04,289
Don't do it.

53
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,793
You will not address
a Captain, boy.

54
00:07:06,834 --> 00:07:08,919
Sir, look at your charts. I
believe you're sailing us,

55
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,296
in to the Devil's Triangle.

56
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,422
Do you hear this man?

57
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:14,467
This landsman, believes
an old sailor's myth.

58
00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:15,510
Sir.

59
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:17,803
With all due respect I have
spent my life studying,

60
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:20,306
the myths of the sea. I know
every legend and every curse.

61
00:07:20,765 --> 00:07:22,474
And I know, ships that
sail into the triangle

62
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:23,517
do not necessarily sail out.

63
00:07:23,518 --> 00:07:24,519
Don't worry sir.

64
00:07:25,562 --> 00:07:28,523
- This one is clearly disturbed.
- Sir, trust in what I say.

65
00:07:28,565 --> 00:07:29,565
Change your course.

66
00:07:29,566 --> 00:07:32,026
You dare to give me orders, boy?

67
00:07:32,068 --> 00:07:33,069
Arrest him.

68
00:07:33,945 --> 00:07:34,946
Turner.

69
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:36,823
I'll not let you kill us all.

70
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,742
Come on.

71
00:07:55,133 --> 00:07:56,301
This is treason.

72
00:07:59,387 --> 00:08:00,387
Lock him up.

73
00:08:00,388 --> 00:08:01,639
- No.
- We're going in.

74
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:10,315
This was your last chance, Turner.

75
00:08:12,984 --> 00:08:15,695
If it were up to me, I'd
string you from the yard arm.

76
00:08:16,446 --> 00:08:17,530
On deck.

77
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:27,957
Jack Sparrow.

78
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,001
He's dead.

79
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:33,379
Buried in an unmarked grave
on the isle of St. Martin.

80
00:09:05,286 --> 00:09:07,497
Sir, there's something
in the water.

81
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:10,458
Ship to starboard.

82
00:09:12,961 --> 00:09:15,755
That's no ship, sir.
It's a shipwreck.

83
00:09:26,474 --> 00:09:27,475
No.

84
00:09:28,351 --> 00:09:29,978
She's sailing straight towards us.

85
00:09:30,395 --> 00:09:32,522
Open fire.

86
00:10:51,768 --> 00:10:53,561
What are you?

87
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:00,652
Death.

88
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,710
WANTED. JACK SPARROW.

89
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:04,090
Do you know this pirate?

90
00:12:05,675 --> 00:12:08,720
- Only by name.
- You're looking for him?

91
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:19,063
- Is that a yes?
- Yes.

92
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:23,276
For too many years the
Triangle has cursed us.

93
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:26,279
Condemned us to
this Hell on Earth.

94
00:12:26,863 --> 00:12:28,615
The key to our escape.

95
00:12:28,698 --> 00:12:32,827
Is Jack Sparrow and the
compass, which he holds.

96
00:12:33,328 --> 00:12:35,496
No, no. No need to fear me boy.

97
00:12:35,538 --> 00:12:37,665
I always leave one man alive

98
00:12:37,707 --> 00:12:38,833
to tell the tale.

99
00:12:39,667 --> 00:12:44,005
Find Sparrow for me
and relay a message.

100
00:12:44,047 --> 00:12:45,882
From Capitan Salazar.

101
00:12:46,216 --> 00:12:47,675
Salazar.

102
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:52,972
Tell him I'll behold
the daylight again.

103
00:12:53,514 --> 00:12:55,058
And on that day.

104
00:13:00,396 --> 00:13:01,731
Death.

105
00:13:03,107 --> 00:13:05,944
Death... will come
straight for him.

106
00:13:07,111 --> 00:13:09,781
Would you say that to him? Please?

107
00:13:09,906 --> 00:13:10,906
Yes.

108
00:13:10,907 --> 00:13:12,659
I wish I could do
it myself, but...

109
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,246
Dead men tell no tales.

110
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,860
Carina Smyth.

111
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:48,611
You're an orphan,
born of the devil.

112
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,947
Accused of practising witchcraft.

113
00:13:51,614 --> 00:13:53,116
Before you die.

114
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,952
Do you have anything to confess?

115
00:13:58,121 --> 00:14:02,959
I confess that I am not a witch.
That I am a woman of science.

116
00:14:03,293 --> 00:14:07,380
I confess that I have survived on
my own, with nothing but a diary

117
00:14:07,422 --> 00:14:08,798
from a father I never knew.

118
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:12,218
And a quest for the
truth of who I am.

119
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:16,139
I confess that I will die
before I give up the search.

120
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:17,765
And I confess.

121
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:21,769
That while we've been
talking. I picked this lock.

122
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:34,157
Today we dedicate The
Royal Bank of St. Martin.

123
00:14:39,037 --> 00:14:43,750
The most secure banking
institution in the Caribbean.

124
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:53,259
Our new vault.

125
00:14:53,301 --> 00:14:55,511
Is 5 inches thick.

126
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:58,097
And weighs an imperial tonne.

127
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:00,350
I've got her.

128
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,600
Get her.

129
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:02,894
Don't let her get away.

130
00:15:02,936 --> 00:15:04,145
Stop that witch.

131
00:15:13,154 --> 00:15:16,866
With this bank, the
town of St. Martin,

132
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:19,452
enters the modern world.

133
00:15:25,542 --> 00:15:27,669
- I'm so sorry, sir.
- The witch escaped her chains.

134
00:15:29,087 --> 00:15:30,797
Find that wicked lass.

135
00:15:30,838 --> 00:15:32,632
Or you swing in her place.

136
00:15:33,091 --> 00:15:34,634
- Sir.
- Sir.

137
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:39,681
No man. Nor army.

138
00:15:39,722 --> 00:15:43,560
Can ever rob the gold
from St. Martin.

139
00:15:44,394 --> 00:15:46,062
Open the vault.

140
00:16:01,035 --> 00:16:02,245
Pirate.

141
00:16:03,538 --> 00:16:04,664
Pirate?

142
00:16:05,623 --> 00:16:06,624
Pirates.

143
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:26,519
This may seem a peculiar question.
Could someone explain to me.

144
00:16:27,228 --> 00:16:29,105
To why I'm here?

145
00:16:38,114 --> 00:16:39,115
How long?

146
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,701
No, no no, wait,
it's coming to me.

147
00:16:42,035 --> 00:16:44,245
Need just a moment
to clear my head.

148
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:47,207
Make ready.

149
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:55,632
Hold your fire. There's a
woman with him in the vault.

150
00:16:59,521 --> 00:17:01,521
Never mind about that trollop.

151
00:17:01,721 --> 00:17:05,683
Sir, I believe...
that's your wife.

152
00:17:11,105 --> 00:17:12,440
Francis?

153
00:17:14,484 --> 00:17:15,902
Oh, I've got it.

154
00:17:17,612 --> 00:17:19,989
I've got it. I'm robbing the bank.

155
00:17:20,031 --> 00:17:21,658
Shoot him.

156
00:18:07,745 --> 00:18:09,497
That was not part of the plan.

157
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:13,960
After him. Don't let him get away.

158
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:56,810
NO DOGS, NO WOMEN.

159
00:19:12,852 --> 00:19:15,688
No woman's ever
handled my Herschel.

160
00:19:23,947 --> 00:19:25,490
Clear a path.

161
00:19:26,658 --> 00:19:28,284
No, no, no, no.

162
00:19:31,037 --> 00:19:32,455
Stop, stop... stop.

163
00:19:45,426 --> 00:19:47,053
Hard to starboard.

164
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:07,031
Sir, your celestial fix was off.

165
00:20:07,115 --> 00:20:08,968
I've adjusted two
degrees north. Your

166
00:20:08,969 --> 00:20:10,577
map will no longer be imprecise.

167
00:20:10,827 --> 00:20:12,911
Although you will have
to start again with it.

168
00:20:12,912 --> 00:20:13,913
You're a witch.

169
00:20:13,997 --> 00:20:16,875
No, I'm not. Am I a witch
for having catalogued.

170
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,377
- Over 200 stars?
- Witch.

171
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:23,089
There is a blood moon coming.

172
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:25,091
I simply need to purchase...

173
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,093
A chronometer.

174
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:29,971
I'll pay you double for
selling to a woman.

175
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:31,139
Help.

176
00:20:33,892 --> 00:20:37,312
Help. Help. There's
a witch in my shop.

177
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,648
And a pirate.

178
00:20:40,815 --> 00:20:42,942
There is a witch and
a pirate in my shop.

179
00:20:42,984 --> 00:20:44,444
Well this is your lucky day.

180
00:20:45,278 --> 00:20:47,697
Have either of the four
of you seen my bank?

181
00:20:51,075 --> 00:20:52,243
Found it.

182
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:58,833
- Were you part of the plan?
- I'm not looking for trouble.

183
00:20:59,042 --> 00:21:00,668
What a horrible way to live.

184
00:21:08,843 --> 00:21:11,638
- Stop that witch. Get her.
- We're trapped.

185
00:21:11,971 --> 00:21:12,972
What do we do?

186
00:21:16,059 --> 00:21:17,810
You need to scream.

187
00:21:20,563 --> 00:21:22,482
Over there. Secure that woman.

188
00:21:24,484 --> 00:21:27,946
- You filthy pirate.
- No need for name calling.

189
00:22:04,732 --> 00:22:06,860
Jack.

190
00:22:11,364 --> 00:22:12,574
Bridge?

191
00:22:47,275 --> 00:22:48,276
It's empty.

192
00:22:49,611 --> 00:22:50,653
Where is the dash?

193
00:22:50,695 --> 00:22:52,739
Do you think that
robbing a bank is easy?

194
00:22:53,198 --> 00:22:55,574
You gaggle of gutless.
You's are the ones.

195
00:22:55,575 --> 00:22:56,761
Guilty of putting me in this

196
00:22:56,762 --> 00:22:58,328
dreadful pickle in
the first place.

197
00:22:58,995 --> 00:23:01,414
Now line up. And
offer me a tribute.

198
00:23:02,415 --> 00:23:04,042
Do you want us to pay you?

199
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,127
Am I not the captain of this ship?

200
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:09,339
You call this a ship?

201
00:23:09,631 --> 00:23:13,091
- Where's the treasure?
- All of us are starving.

202
00:23:13,092 --> 00:23:15,428
We'll no longer follow a
captain without a ship.

203
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,721
I have a ship.

204
00:23:18,598 --> 00:23:21,267
Black Pearl has
never left me side.

205
00:23:21,643 --> 00:23:24,354
The pirate Barbossa
rules these seas now.

206
00:23:24,771 --> 00:23:27,357
Has 10 ships. Guns full.

207
00:23:27,899 --> 00:23:31,236
Not to mention his canon balls.
18 pounds each they say.

208
00:23:31,277 --> 00:23:33,363
One legged man with
18 pound balls?

209
00:23:33,988 --> 00:23:35,490
That's why he walks funny.

210
00:23:35,949 --> 00:23:37,534
Oh come, come mates?

211
00:23:37,575 --> 00:23:39,786
Did we not find the treasure
of Macedonia together?

212
00:23:39,869 --> 00:23:41,579
It was a troll of rotten wood.

213
00:23:41,621 --> 00:23:44,123
- Gold of King Midas.
- A pile of donkey dung.

214
00:23:44,624 --> 00:23:47,042
Face it Jack. Bad luck dogs you,

215
00:23:47,043 --> 00:23:48,043
day & night.

216
00:23:48,044 --> 00:23:50,630
Now that is a blatant fabrication.

217
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:58,388
- You've lost your luck.
- You've lost your ship.

218
00:23:58,638 --> 00:24:01,182
Now... you've lost your crew.

219
00:24:01,683 --> 00:24:04,519
Jack Sparrow is no
longer our captain.

220
00:24:08,731 --> 00:24:13,069
I'm sorry Jack. But we've
reached the end of the horizon.

221
00:24:24,169 --> 00:24:25,169
Right then.

222
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:28,001
You're all dismissed.

223
00:24:29,168 --> 00:24:31,212
All of ya. Dismissed.

224
00:24:32,171 --> 00:24:34,424
Never sail with Captain
Jack Sparrow again.

225
00:24:34,507 --> 00:24:35,675
Tell you that.

226
00:25:23,181 --> 00:25:24,974
The whole town speaks of you.

227
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:28,394
The only survivor of the
Monarch. A boy who paddled

228
00:25:28,478 --> 00:25:30,396
all the way to St.
Martin, against the tide

229
00:25:30,438 --> 00:25:31,981
on a piece of driftwood.

230
00:25:32,232 --> 00:25:35,151
Now jabbering about pirates.

231
00:25:35,527 --> 00:25:37,237
And Tridents.

232
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:39,364
Please sir, let me
go of these chains.

233
00:25:39,405 --> 00:25:42,617
My job is to protect this
island and these waters.

234
00:25:43,451 --> 00:25:48,540
And your sleeves have been
ripped. The mark of treason.

235
00:25:48,665 --> 00:25:49,665
We were attacked by the dead.

236
00:25:49,666 --> 00:25:51,584
You're a coward who
ran from battle.

237
00:25:52,335 --> 00:25:54,254
And that is how you die.

238
00:26:06,182 --> 00:26:09,936
- I don't believe you're a coward.
- Please leave me sister.

239
00:26:09,978 --> 00:26:11,563
I've risked my life to come here.

240
00:26:12,021 --> 00:26:13,690
To see if the rumours are true.

241
00:26:14,023 --> 00:26:17,485
- You speak of the Trident?
- Who are you?

242
00:26:17,527 --> 00:26:20,530
Tell me why you seek the Trident?

243
00:26:20,531 --> 00:26:22,615
The Trident can break,

244
00:26:22,657 --> 00:26:24,117
any curse at sea.

245
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:27,537
My father is trapped
by such a curse.

246
00:26:27,579 --> 00:26:29,706
You're aware that curses are
not supported by science.

247
00:26:29,956 --> 00:26:32,959
- Neither are ghosts.
- So you have gone mad?

248
00:26:33,126 --> 00:26:35,587
- I should never have come here.
- Then why did you come here?

249
00:26:36,045 --> 00:26:37,839
Because I need to get
off this island.

250
00:26:37,964 --> 00:26:39,048
To solve the map.

251
00:26:39,132 --> 00:26:40,300
"No man can read".

252
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,468
Left by Poseidon himself.

253
00:26:44,721 --> 00:26:46,291
You've read the ancient text?

254
00:26:46,292 --> 00:26:48,266
In each language
they were written.

255
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:52,562
But this map has never
been seen or read,

256
00:26:52,604 --> 00:26:53,771
by any man.

257
00:26:54,564 --> 00:26:56,107
Luckily I'm a woman.

258
00:26:59,944 --> 00:27:02,572
This is the diary
of Galileo Galilei.

259
00:27:02,906 --> 00:27:05,241
He's spent his life
searching for the Trident,

260
00:27:05,283 --> 00:27:07,619
It's why he invented the spyglass.

261
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:10,663
Why astronomers have spent their
lives staring in to the sky.

262
00:27:11,706 --> 00:27:13,875
So you're saying the
map no man can read,

263
00:27:14,292 --> 00:27:15,627
Is hidden in the stars?

264
00:27:15,668 --> 00:27:18,963
It was left to me by my father.
He believed I could find.

265
00:27:19,047 --> 00:27:21,216
What no man has ever found.

266
00:27:21,257 --> 00:27:22,717
I will not let him down.

267
00:27:23,551 --> 00:27:25,970
Soon, there will be a blood moon.

268
00:27:26,012 --> 00:27:28,014
Only then can the map be read.

269
00:27:28,848 --> 00:27:31,935
- And the Trident found.
- Who are you?

270
00:27:32,101 --> 00:27:35,271
- Carina Smyth.
- If you wish to save your father,

271
00:27:35,313 --> 00:27:38,066
you'll have to save
me. Find us a ship.

272
00:27:38,107 --> 00:27:39,484
And the Trident will be ours.

273
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:42,570
Come to me witch.

274
00:27:46,824 --> 00:27:48,159
Oh.

275
00:27:55,041 --> 00:27:56,209
He's gone.

276
00:27:57,252 --> 00:27:58,503
He's gone sir.

277
00:28:01,172 --> 00:28:02,840
Find that coward.

278
00:28:03,341 --> 00:28:05,301
He'll hang with the witch.

279
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:09,889
Think Captain Jack's washed up?

280
00:28:10,807 --> 00:28:13,393
I have not had a wash in years.

281
00:28:17,605 --> 00:28:19,023
Check the alley down there.

282
00:28:19,357 --> 00:28:22,151
You two, check the church.
The rest of you, with me.

283
00:28:29,242 --> 00:28:30,410
Bugger.

284
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,759
JACK SPARROW
THE NOTORIOUS PIRATE

285
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,600
DEAD OR ALIVE
GOD SAVE THE KING

286
00:28:49,804 --> 00:28:52,556
May I please have a drink, please?

287
00:28:52,557 --> 00:28:54,267
Show me your silver.

288
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,351
Silver?

289
00:29:02,358 --> 00:29:03,985
How about a trade?

290
00:29:06,863 --> 00:29:08,156
Give me the bottle.

291
00:30:03,503 --> 00:30:04,629
Capitan.

292
00:30:05,588 --> 00:30:06,965
What's happening?

293
00:30:11,261 --> 00:30:15,265
Jack Sparrow, Jack Sparrow
has given away the compass.

294
00:30:27,652 --> 00:30:29,946
Daylight. Daylight.

295
00:30:46,629 --> 00:30:48,298
We're free.

296
00:30:56,014 --> 00:30:59,976
Now, now, it's time,
to hunt a pirate.

297
00:31:07,609 --> 00:31:09,194
Pirate's life.

298
00:31:18,828 --> 00:31:20,205
Come to daddy.

299
00:31:21,331 --> 00:31:23,333
Just the man we've
been looking for.

300
00:31:23,416 --> 00:31:25,376
Why? Why am I looked for?

301
00:31:25,543 --> 00:31:27,962
Let it be known that the
pirate Jack Sparrow.

302
00:31:28,004 --> 00:31:30,173
Will be executed at dawn.

303
00:31:30,215 --> 00:31:31,424
Executed?

304
00:31:31,716 --> 00:31:36,346
I will never set foot in this town
again, sir. You mark my words.

305
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:41,146
I do mean it, you know. I shall
never be back here again.

306
00:33:22,785 --> 00:33:25,163
To release the power of the sea.

307
00:33:25,663 --> 00:33:27,332
One must divide.

308
00:33:31,461 --> 00:33:34,839
It's an island. The stars
lead to an island.

309
00:33:45,339 --> 00:33:46,839
Goodbye there sir.

310
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:49,539
Very good. Make the
rest of the sails.

311
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:54,505
I'm looking for a
pirate, Jack Sparrow.

312
00:33:54,506 --> 00:33:55,506
Bugger off.

313
00:33:59,489 --> 00:34:00,823
I need to speak with you.

314
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:09,832
- Hand me your sword.
- I don't have a sword.

315
00:34:09,874 --> 00:34:11,738
What kind of soldier
has no weapon?

316
00:34:11,739 --> 00:34:13,503
I'm currently wanted for treason.

317
00:34:14,754 --> 00:34:16,297
So, not the very good kind, then.

318
00:34:16,339 --> 00:34:19,008
I'm looking for a pirate,
Captain Jack Sparrow?

319
00:34:20,218 --> 00:34:24,514
Well, today is your lucky day.
Because I just happen to be.

320
00:34:24,764 --> 00:34:27,934
Captain Jack Sparrow.

321
00:34:32,856 --> 00:34:34,399
No, it can't be.

322
00:34:34,691 --> 00:34:37,694
I've spent years
searching for. This?

323
00:34:38,069 --> 00:34:40,613
The great Jack Sparrow is
not some drunk in a cell.

324
00:34:41,114 --> 00:34:43,533
Do you even have a ship? A crew?

325
00:34:45,285 --> 00:34:46,411
Pants.

326
00:34:47,203 --> 00:34:49,956
A great pirate does not
require such intricacies.

327
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:52,165
Do you know how long I've
been waiting for this moment?

328
00:34:52,166 --> 00:34:54,252
The risks I've taken to be here?

329
00:34:54,335 --> 00:34:56,421
Are you sure you're
the Jack Sparrow?

330
00:34:56,422 --> 00:34:57,672
The real question is.

331
00:34:57,922 --> 00:35:00,300
- Who are you?
- My name is Henry Turner.

332
00:35:00,633 --> 00:35:02,635
Son of Will Turner
and Elisabeth Swann.

333
00:35:03,678 --> 00:35:05,555
You're the evil spawn of them two?

334
00:35:06,723 --> 00:35:09,058
Does mummy ever ask about me?

335
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,100
No.

336
00:35:10,101 --> 00:35:13,312
Go on. She call my
name in her sleep?

337
00:35:13,313 --> 00:35:14,772
She never spoke of you.

338
00:35:16,024 --> 00:35:17,942
Are you sure we're talking
about the same people?

339
00:35:18,234 --> 00:35:19,903
He's a cursed eunuch.

340
00:35:20,111 --> 00:35:22,655
She's golden haired, stubborn,

341
00:35:22,697 --> 00:35:25,783
pouty lips. Neck like a giraffe.

342
00:35:25,867 --> 00:35:27,711
And two of the those wonderful...

343
00:35:27,712 --> 00:35:28,786
Yes Yes, it's her.

344
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,122
I need you to listen Jack.

345
00:35:32,123 --> 00:35:34,000
Because at the moment
you're all I've got.

346
00:35:34,375 --> 00:35:36,106
I found a way to save
my father. There

347
00:35:36,107 --> 00:35:37,837
is one thing that can
break his curse,

348
00:35:37,962 --> 00:35:39,631
and free him from the Dutchmen.

349
00:35:41,966 --> 00:35:43,593
The Trident of Poseidon.

350
00:35:45,637 --> 00:35:47,931
The treasure to be found with...

351
00:35:47,972 --> 00:35:50,225
the map that no man can read.

352
00:35:53,144 --> 00:35:54,562
Never heard of it.

353
00:35:55,605 --> 00:35:57,482
There is a girl inside
this prison, Jack,

354
00:35:57,524 --> 00:35:58,608
who holds that map.

355
00:35:58,983 --> 00:36:01,694
The moon has turned to blood,
the Trident will be found.

356
00:36:01,819 --> 00:36:03,738
And you could be the
one who holds the sea.

357
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,823
And with it become all
that you once were.

358
00:36:05,865 --> 00:36:06,866
The great.

359
00:36:08,743 --> 00:36:09,744
Jack.

360
00:36:10,745 --> 00:36:12,997
Oh, I'm so sorry. Were
you still talking?

361
00:36:13,197 --> 00:36:14,597
I believe I nodded off a bit.

362
00:36:15,667 --> 00:36:16,918
One more thing.

363
00:36:17,293 --> 00:36:20,338
A message from someone you
know, named Captain Salazar.

364
00:36:23,383 --> 00:36:25,635
I once knew a Spaniard named...

365
00:36:26,636 --> 00:36:28,096
Something in Spanish.

366
00:36:28,638 --> 00:36:31,641
El Matador Del Mar. The
butcher of the sea.

367
00:36:31,933 --> 00:36:35,645
Him? No, no, no. Quite
happily he's dead.

368
00:36:35,687 --> 00:36:38,147
Very, very dead. Ship went down.

369
00:36:38,189 --> 00:36:39,482
Inside the triangle.

370
00:36:40,441 --> 00:36:42,402
He's coming for you
Jack, to seek revenge.

371
00:36:42,443 --> 00:36:43,987
As the dead man's tale is told.

372
00:36:44,195 --> 00:36:45,655
I don't believe you.

373
00:36:48,366 --> 00:36:49,450
What did he say?

374
00:36:49,492 --> 00:36:51,077
He said your compass was the key,

375
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:53,079
to his escape. An army of dead,

376
00:36:53,121 --> 00:36:54,747
are coming straight for you, Jack.

377
00:36:54,956 --> 00:36:57,417
The Trident of Poseidon
is your only hope.

378
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,920
Do we have an accord?

379
00:37:09,554 --> 00:37:11,767
I'm not going in
there to tell him.

380
00:37:11,768 --> 00:37:12,932
It was your idea.

381
00:37:12,974 --> 00:37:16,019
No, it was my idea
for you to tell him.

382
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,770
He likes you more than me.

383
00:37:17,812 --> 00:37:19,564
He doesn't like anybody.

384
00:37:42,462 --> 00:37:45,464
Sorry sir. We know you
said never to disturb you.

385
00:37:45,465 --> 00:37:47,466
Or to come in without good cause.

386
00:37:47,467 --> 00:37:49,302
Or to speak without first...

387
00:37:50,637 --> 00:37:52,638
asking ourselves whether our,

388
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:55,141
thoughts were
absolutely necessary.

389
00:37:55,308 --> 00:37:57,393
Like the time the
ship was on fire.

390
00:37:57,435 --> 00:37:59,520
That being an example
of necessary thought.

391
00:37:59,521 --> 00:38:02,732
So again, we do apologise
for starting that fire.

392
00:38:09,614 --> 00:38:10,657
Speak.

393
00:38:11,115 --> 00:38:14,786
It's the ships, sir. They're
being attacked by an enemy.

394
00:38:14,827 --> 00:38:18,497
- That takes no riches.
- Kills without provocation.

395
00:38:18,498 --> 00:38:21,334
The ships? Not possible.

396
00:38:21,376 --> 00:38:23,503
Three have already been sunk, sir.

397
00:38:23,711 --> 00:38:26,422
They've been sunk by a
captain called Salamander.

398
00:38:26,589 --> 00:38:27,966
Sandoval.

399
00:38:29,551 --> 00:38:30,718
Salazar.

400
00:38:30,927 --> 00:38:34,513
That's it, your sireness. He
leaves one man from each vessel.

401
00:38:34,514 --> 00:38:38,768
To tell the tale. The
entire fleet is being sunk.

402
00:38:39,143 --> 00:38:41,813
And we'll soon be dead.

403
00:38:42,647 --> 00:38:45,191
And quite possibly
out of business.

404
00:38:51,447 --> 00:38:53,867
I'll be needing some
time with your witch.

405
00:39:08,882 --> 00:39:13,887
I've been expecting you Captain.
Perhaps you'd like some tea.

406
00:39:17,557 --> 00:39:19,893
I shall pass, thank you kindly.

407
00:39:21,227 --> 00:39:24,564
The price of crossing my
door is blood, Captain.

408
00:39:25,481 --> 00:39:28,151
That explains why
you're not so busy.

409
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:31,154
Everyone pays, eventually.

410
00:39:32,572 --> 00:39:35,241
Shansa, you and I
made a bond long ago.

411
00:39:35,533 --> 00:39:37,035
I saved you from the gallows.

412
00:39:37,202 --> 00:39:38,202
Remember?

413
00:39:38,203 --> 00:39:40,371
And I cursed your enemies.

414
00:39:40,496 --> 00:39:42,999
But now you come to me in fear.

415
00:39:43,041 --> 00:39:46,294
As the dead have taken
command over the sea.

416
00:39:46,336 --> 00:39:49,589
And what would the dead
be wanting with me?

417
00:39:49,631 --> 00:39:51,758
Not you, Captain.

418
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:55,803
- They're searching for a Sparrow.
- Jack?

419
00:39:58,723 --> 00:40:04,854
Jack will sail for the Trident.
With a girl and a Pearl.

420
00:40:05,563 --> 00:40:08,525
The Trident can never be found.

421
00:40:11,861 --> 00:40:14,656
The Trident is Jack's only hope.

422
00:40:14,781 --> 00:40:16,616
The dead are conquering the sea,

423
00:40:16,658 --> 00:40:19,077
unable to step on dry land.

424
00:40:21,996 --> 00:40:24,999
Maybe you should retire
to the countryside.

425
00:40:27,293 --> 00:40:28,962
Do you mean grass?

426
00:40:29,837 --> 00:40:31,172
On a farm?

427
00:40:31,923 --> 00:40:34,509
Milking a cow, making cheese.

428
00:40:35,134 --> 00:40:40,306
- While they sink me treasure?
- Ask yourself this, Captain.

429
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:43,778
Is this treasure worth dying for?

430
00:40:43,779 --> 00:40:45,061
I'm a pirate.

431
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:49,023
Always will be. So how do I save,

432
00:40:49,065 --> 00:40:51,818
- what be mine.
- Jack held a compass.

433
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:54,612
Which points you to the
thing you desire most.

434
00:40:54,696 --> 00:40:56,781
But betray the compass...

435
00:40:57,031 --> 00:40:59,450
And it releases
your greatest fear.

436
00:40:59,492 --> 00:41:03,079
And a pirate's greatest fear
will be Salazar, is it?

437
00:41:06,624 --> 00:41:09,752
- How did you get this?
- I have my ways.

438
00:41:09,961 --> 00:41:12,922
Lead them to Jack before
he finds the Trident.

439
00:41:13,172 --> 00:41:16,801
And all your treasure
will come back to you.

440
00:41:18,303 --> 00:41:20,847
Time to make a deal with the dead.

441
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,852
Come on, pirate.

442
00:41:32,859 --> 00:41:34,235
Hold on, stop.

443
00:41:34,335 --> 00:41:35,335
Dad?

444
00:41:39,449 --> 00:41:43,328
- Uncle Jack.
- Jackie boy, how's it going?

445
00:41:43,369 --> 00:41:45,163
Can't complain really. You?

446
00:41:45,205 --> 00:41:47,582
I've been waiting all morning
in here, for a beating.

447
00:41:47,707 --> 00:41:50,585
- But the service is terrible.
- Shameful.

448
00:41:51,085 --> 00:41:52,128
Jack.

449
00:41:54,005 --> 00:41:56,299
The oceans have turned to blood.

450
00:41:56,341 --> 00:41:59,260
Best to stay on dry
land, where it's safe.

451
00:41:59,844 --> 00:42:02,972
I'm about to be
executed on dry land.

452
00:42:03,014 --> 00:42:04,014
Good point.

453
00:42:04,015 --> 00:42:06,184
Did I ever told you the
one about the skeleton?

454
00:42:06,309 --> 00:42:07,602
Yes you have, many times.

455
00:42:07,644 --> 00:42:10,355
Skeleton goes into a
bar, orders a beer.

456
00:42:10,522 --> 00:42:11,773
And a mop.

457
00:42:13,942 --> 00:42:15,151
Funny as ever.

458
00:42:15,652 --> 00:42:16,778
Come on let's go.

459
00:42:17,946 --> 00:42:20,342
If they disembowel you, ask for

460
00:42:20,343 --> 00:42:23,201
Viktor. He's got
the softest hands.

461
00:42:23,284 --> 00:42:24,284
Thank you.

462
00:42:24,285 --> 00:42:27,080
And mention my name, they
won't cut your feet off.

463
00:42:47,517 --> 00:42:49,978
Come on. You're first.

464
00:42:52,939 --> 00:42:55,275
And how would you
like to die pirate?

465
00:42:55,316 --> 00:42:59,237
Hanging, firing squad
or a new invention.

466
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,573
- The guillotine.
- Guillotine?

467
00:43:02,156 --> 00:43:04,199
Sounds French. I love the French.

468
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,202
Did you know that they
invented mayonnaise?

469
00:43:06,327 --> 00:43:08,580
How bad could it be?
It's French, right?

470
00:43:12,333 --> 00:43:14,794
Oh, my bad. I changed me mind.

471
00:43:20,925 --> 00:43:24,137
No, please have mercy upon
me. I'm a bet wetter.

472
00:43:41,321 --> 00:43:42,530
Oh, come on.

473
00:43:42,572 --> 00:43:45,158
I mean I have to walk
upstairs as well for this?

474
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,745
- Bring the basket.
- Basket... why?

475
00:43:50,455 --> 00:43:51,539
Strap him down.

476
00:43:59,464 --> 00:44:01,841
Here's an idea.

477
00:44:01,966 --> 00:44:03,947
Why don't we try a
good old fashioned

478
00:44:03,948 --> 00:44:06,137
stoning? I'd kill to
be stoned right now.

479
00:44:06,387 --> 00:44:08,181
Gets the crowd
involved, doesn't it?

480
00:44:08,473 --> 00:44:10,474
I should like to speak to
Victor in disembowelment.

481
00:44:10,475 --> 00:44:11,684
I should like to speak to Vic.

482
00:44:13,353 --> 00:44:15,355
I'm not one to complain normally,

483
00:44:15,522 --> 00:44:17,565
but this basket's full of heads.

484
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:30,537
Final words of
Carina Smyth. Quiet.

485
00:44:35,208 --> 00:44:37,168
The final words of Carina Smyth.

486
00:44:37,627 --> 00:44:39,963
Good sirs. I'm not a witch.

487
00:44:40,004 --> 00:44:43,383
But I forgive your common dim
wittedness and feeble brains.

488
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:45,676
In short, most of you
have the mind of a goat.

489
00:44:45,677 --> 00:44:47,804
Pardon me sir. Is it
not common practise...

490
00:44:47,845 --> 00:44:49,639
for those about to be executed

491
00:44:49,681 --> 00:44:52,308
to be granted a last, I don't
know, something or another...?

492
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:55,103
I believe I was making a point.
If you could just be patient.

493
00:44:55,395 --> 00:44:56,521
No.

494
00:44:56,688 --> 00:44:59,607
My head's about to be lopped
off. Hence the urgency.

495
00:44:59,649 --> 00:45:01,109
And my neck is to be broken.

496
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:03,862
Did you know that on occasion,
the neck doesn't actually break.

497
00:45:03,903 --> 00:45:05,822
- It just hurts.
- What?

498
00:45:05,864 --> 00:45:06,865
Oh yes.

499
00:45:07,156 --> 00:45:08,741
I've seen men swing for hours.

500
00:45:08,783 --> 00:45:10,285
Eyes bulging, tongues swelling.

501
00:45:10,368 --> 00:45:12,412
- Revolting gurgling sound.
- May I finish?

502
00:45:12,453 --> 00:45:13,997
No. You're lucky.

503
00:45:14,205 --> 00:45:15,540
Wish I was hung.

504
00:45:16,457 --> 00:45:18,053
Kill the filthy pirate, I'll wait.

505
00:45:18,054 --> 00:45:19,054
The witch is first.

506
00:45:19,085 --> 00:45:21,045
I'm not a witch. Did
you not listen?

507
00:45:21,087 --> 00:45:23,214
Quite hard to listen when you
have the mind of a goat.

508
00:45:23,256 --> 00:45:25,008
Enough. Kill them both.

509
00:45:25,049 --> 00:45:26,467
Yes.

510
00:45:46,821 --> 00:45:50,658
There's another noose. Did you
think you could defeat us boy?

511
00:45:50,825 --> 00:45:53,244
No sir, I'm just a diversion.

512
00:45:54,078 --> 00:45:55,663
Fire.

513
00:46:21,523 --> 00:46:23,233
I'd still rather be stoned.

514
00:46:28,404 --> 00:46:29,864
Reload.

515
00:46:49,759 --> 00:46:50,802
Thank you.

516
00:47:00,728 --> 00:47:03,147
Come here. You pirate scum.

517
00:47:03,189 --> 00:47:04,190
Hey.

518
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:15,285
What're you doing? No, no, no, no.

519
00:47:15,485 --> 00:47:16,485
Careful.

520
00:47:25,879 --> 00:47:27,046
Horses?

521
00:47:45,481 --> 00:47:47,734
- Thank you.
- You're welcome milady.

522
00:47:49,569 --> 00:47:50,612
Got you.

523
00:47:56,534 --> 00:47:58,286
Knew you'd come
crawling back, traitor.

524
00:47:58,328 --> 00:47:59,621
The Turner boy gave us.

525
00:47:59,704 --> 00:48:02,081
10 silver pieces
to save your neck.

526
00:48:09,088 --> 00:48:10,840
From this moment on
we are to be allies.

527
00:48:10,882 --> 00:48:12,342
Considering where
your left hand is,

528
00:48:12,383 --> 00:48:14,635
- I'd say we're more than that.
- We find the Trident together.

529
00:48:14,636 --> 00:48:15,636
Do I have your word?

530
00:48:15,637 --> 00:48:17,347
You're holding
everything but my word.

531
00:48:17,597 --> 00:48:19,933
Then I bestow upon you
the honour of saving me.

532
00:48:19,974 --> 00:48:21,100
For a small donation.

533
00:48:21,267 --> 00:48:23,645
You expect us to pay
you to save you?

534
00:48:25,104 --> 00:48:26,105
Yes.

535
00:48:27,857 --> 00:48:29,442
For a mere 10 pieces.

536
00:48:35,698 --> 00:48:36,866
Madness.

537
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,577
- We won't pay more than 5.
- Well, then.

538
00:48:39,702 --> 00:48:40,995
8 it is.

539
00:48:41,287 --> 00:48:42,621
Perhaps we could
discuss this later,

540
00:48:42,622 --> 00:48:44,457
as I'm having trouble
hoisting your porch.

541
00:48:44,499 --> 00:48:46,764
You're far from port.
That is my stern.

542
00:48:46,765 --> 00:48:47,765
Are you sure?

543
00:48:47,766 --> 00:48:50,588
- Positive.
- Well, look at this.

544
00:48:51,381 --> 00:48:54,133
If I kill the coward,
the witch hangs.

545
00:48:54,175 --> 00:48:57,135
- Two for the price of one.
- Please don't let go of me.

546
00:48:57,136 --> 00:48:58,930
It might be difficult
once he kills me.

547
00:49:04,519 --> 00:49:07,896
Gentlemen, these two
prisoners will lead us,

548
00:49:07,897 --> 00:49:09,315
to the Trident.

549
00:49:11,317 --> 00:49:15,405
Captain. Do you really think
we can find the Trident?

550
00:49:15,446 --> 00:49:16,781
Master Gibbs, you old worrywart.

551
00:49:16,865 --> 00:49:19,367
There's nothing to be
concerned about at all.

552
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:24,585
What could possibly
go wrong, right?

553
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:26,165
So this was your plan?

554
00:49:26,207 --> 00:49:27,709
To be tortured and
killed by pirates?

555
00:49:27,792 --> 00:49:29,084
You said you needed a ship.

556
00:49:29,085 --> 00:49:31,504
- You call this a ship?
- Cut the shard.

557
00:49:40,138 --> 00:49:42,098
Prepare to drown.

558
00:49:58,489 --> 00:50:00,742
My dear beloved crew. Finally...

559
00:50:00,783 --> 00:50:01,783
Today is.

560
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,100
DYING GULL.

561
00:50:12,962 --> 00:50:14,047
Something's gone wrong.

562
00:50:33,566 --> 00:50:35,109
She floats.

563
00:50:38,988 --> 00:50:40,990
Ship dead ahead.

564
00:50:48,456 --> 00:50:49,457
Sir.

565
00:50:51,084 --> 00:50:54,837
We would never question
your reason as a captain.

566
00:50:54,879 --> 00:50:56,047
But, however.

567
00:50:56,881 --> 00:50:59,592
Is there a reason as
captain, you've chosen.

568
00:50:59,634 --> 00:51:01,469
To sail in this
unreasonable direction?

569
00:51:02,387 --> 00:51:04,514
Tell the men to prepare
to be boarded.

570
00:51:04,556 --> 00:51:05,640
To stand their ground.

571
00:51:05,682 --> 00:51:07,350
And show no fear.

572
00:51:13,022 --> 00:51:16,609
Capitan. A ship sails towards us.

573
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:46,347
Captain Salazar. I hear you've
been looking for Jack Sparrow.

574
00:52:09,996 --> 00:52:11,748
Hold point.

575
00:52:14,626 --> 00:52:16,211
And await orders.

576
00:52:37,065 --> 00:52:40,818
My name is Captain Barbossa.
And I stand before you,

577
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:44,197
- with cordial intent.
- Ay, ay heh, cordial intent.

578
00:52:44,405 --> 00:52:48,368
Do you hear that? This
pirate wishes to be cordial.

579
00:52:48,493 --> 00:52:52,247
So let me show you what
my cordiality is, hombre.

580
00:52:52,288 --> 00:52:54,499
Every time I tap my sword.

581
00:52:54,999 --> 00:52:58,294
One of your men will die, So
I suggest you speak quickly.

582
00:53:02,423 --> 00:53:04,759
Might want to go a
bit faster capitan.

583
00:53:08,429 --> 00:53:12,559
- Where's Jack Sparrow?
- Jack be sailing for the Trident.

584
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:16,020
- No. The sea belongs to the dead.
- The Trident controls the seas.

585
00:53:16,145 --> 00:53:19,732
No, no. There's no treasure.

586
00:53:19,774 --> 00:53:21,192
There's no treasure...

587
00:53:21,234 --> 00:53:24,070
that can save him. He
will die with you.

588
00:53:24,112 --> 00:53:26,364
I be the only one that
can lead you to him.

589
00:53:27,991 --> 00:53:31,244
I declare you shall have Jack's
life by sunrise on the morrow.

590
00:53:31,286 --> 00:53:34,622
Or you can take me own then.
Do we have an accord?

591
00:53:41,546 --> 00:53:45,091
Take me to him, and you
will live to tell the tale.

592
00:53:45,508 --> 00:53:47,343
You have my word.

593
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:50,847
I thank you on behalf of me crew.

594
00:53:55,185 --> 00:53:59,856
Ole. You can take what's left of
them. The living come aboard.

595
00:54:08,198 --> 00:54:10,408
Carina, we haven't got much time,

596
00:54:10,450 --> 00:54:11,993
the dead are sailing
straight for us.

597
00:54:12,035 --> 00:54:14,245
- Is that so?
- Yes, I've spoken to them.

598
00:54:14,329 --> 00:54:15,330
You spoken to them?

599
00:54:15,371 --> 00:54:17,582
Have you spoken to krakens
and mermaids as well?

600
00:54:17,874 --> 00:54:19,208
Krakens don't speak,
everyone knows that.

601
00:54:19,209 --> 00:54:21,920
Of course, I never
should have saved you.

602
00:54:22,503 --> 00:54:25,256
Last night there was a blood
moon, just as you described.

603
00:54:25,298 --> 00:54:26,507
Tell me what it revealed.

604
00:54:26,549 --> 00:54:27,967
And why should I trust you?

605
00:54:28,134 --> 00:54:30,094
You trusted me to hold
your porch, remember?

606
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:31,220
It was my stern.

607
00:54:31,221 --> 00:54:33,056
Clearly you need to
spend more time at sea.

608
00:54:33,097 --> 00:54:35,308
Tell me what you found and
I promise to help you.

609
00:54:35,350 --> 00:54:36,350
I don't need any help.

610
00:54:36,351 --> 00:54:37,977
Then why did come to me Carina?

611
00:54:38,394 --> 00:54:40,145
Why are we tied together
in the middle of the sea.

612
00:54:40,146 --> 00:54:41,523
Chasing the same treasure?

613
00:54:44,526 --> 00:54:46,236
The moon revealed a clue.

614
00:54:46,528 --> 00:54:48,613
To release the power of the sea.

615
00:54:49,197 --> 00:54:52,283
- One must divide.
- Divide?

616
00:54:52,450 --> 00:54:56,162
- What does it mean?
- I'm not sure yet.

617
00:54:58,081 --> 00:54:59,541
Then we'll find out.

618
00:55:01,459 --> 00:55:04,504
- There is no map in this map.
- Give me my diary.

619
00:55:06,256 --> 00:55:07,891
Give me the map no man can read.

620
00:55:07,932 --> 00:55:08,932
If you could read it,

621
00:55:08,967 --> 00:55:10,634
then it wouldn't be called
the map no man can read.

622
00:55:10,635 --> 00:55:12,595
I beg you please,
don't argue with her.

623
00:55:12,971 --> 00:55:15,098
Most of the men on
this ship can't read.

624
00:55:15,849 --> 00:55:17,600
Which makes all maps

625
00:55:17,642 --> 00:55:19,602
the maps that no man can read.

626
00:55:19,686 --> 00:55:22,397
Well if you can't read it, then
you have no use for it, or me.

627
00:55:23,606 --> 00:55:26,651
Let me start again.
Show me the map.

628
00:55:27,443 --> 00:55:29,612
I can't. It doesn't yet exist.

629
00:55:30,196 --> 00:55:32,866
- She's a witch.
- I'm an astronomer.

630
00:55:34,075 --> 00:55:37,370
- She breeds donkeys.
- What? No.

631
00:55:37,412 --> 00:55:39,843
An astronomer
contemplates the sky.

632
00:55:39,844 --> 00:55:41,123
Yay, on a donkey.

633
00:55:41,124 --> 00:55:44,794
- No, there's no donkey.
- Well then how do you breed then?

634
00:55:45,169 --> 00:55:49,299
Allows me to simplify this
equation. Give me the map.

635
00:55:51,009 --> 00:55:56,514
Or I will kill...
him. I'll kill him.

636
00:55:58,850 --> 00:56:01,644
Go on then. You're bluffing.

637
00:56:02,937 --> 00:56:04,522
And you're blushing.

638
00:56:06,316 --> 00:56:07,567
Throw him over.

639
00:56:12,071 --> 00:56:14,115
We call this keel hauling.

640
00:56:14,949 --> 00:56:17,327
Young Henry will be tossed over.

641
00:56:18,786 --> 00:56:21,289
And he will be dragged
under the ship.

642
00:56:21,497 --> 00:56:22,540
Alright.

643
00:56:23,041 --> 00:56:25,460
- What're you waiting for?
- He doesn't appear to be bluff...

644
00:56:26,711 --> 00:56:29,339
No. Not bluffing, me. He's
trying to say something.

645
00:56:29,589 --> 00:56:32,217
No, no, we don't have
any food aboard. Sorry.

646
00:56:33,343 --> 00:56:35,178
If he's lucky, he'll drown,

647
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:37,680
before the barnacles
shred him to ribbons.

648
00:56:37,847 --> 00:56:40,099
- Barnacles.
- Like a thousands knives,

649
00:56:40,141 --> 00:56:43,144
across your back. And of course,
the blood attracts sharks.

650
00:56:43,186 --> 00:56:44,186
Sharks?

651
00:56:44,187 --> 00:56:46,356
- Shark of the bow.
- Where?

652
00:56:46,481 --> 00:56:49,692
I would say that swimming is
no longer his primary concern.

653
00:56:50,193 --> 00:56:51,361
The map is there.

654
00:56:51,903 --> 00:56:53,988
- Where?
- On the tip of your finger?

655
00:56:54,030 --> 00:56:56,366
No. In the heavens.

656
00:56:56,658 --> 00:56:58,367
That diary will lead me to a map,

657
00:56:58,368 --> 00:56:59,410
hidden in the stars.

658
00:56:59,536 --> 00:57:02,038
Let him up, I'll find it tonight.

659
00:57:02,163 --> 00:57:03,831
Sorry, can't bring him up.

660
00:57:03,873 --> 00:57:05,208
Look for yourself.

661
00:57:08,419 --> 00:57:11,089
As I said. Blushing.

662
00:57:17,387 --> 00:57:18,847
Filthy pirate.

663
00:57:23,476 --> 00:57:26,938
The sea has turned to blood,
a sailor washed ashore.

664
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:30,525
Talking about the Trident. He
was looking for Jack Sparrow.

665
00:57:30,692 --> 00:57:33,486
The same pirate who saved
a witch from the gallows.

666
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:36,906
- She's no witch.
- But you are.

667
00:57:38,157 --> 00:57:42,203
- And you're going to help us.
- You're afraid, Lieutenant.

668
00:57:42,871 --> 00:57:44,914
As ships burn in the
night, you want

669
00:57:44,915 --> 00:57:46,791
to know if you can save your own.

670
00:57:47,834 --> 00:57:49,935
If the Trident is real?

671
00:57:49,936 --> 00:57:53,464
You're going to read
that wall for me.

672
00:57:53,673 --> 00:57:56,342
Or you will die. The
British Empire will have.

673
00:57:56,384 --> 00:57:58,519
The Trident and rule
the sea. I want

674
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:00,597
to know where that
pirate is going,

675
00:58:00,638 --> 00:58:01,973
with that witch.

676
00:58:03,141 --> 00:58:07,645
Your destiny is in these
stars. I will set your course.

677
00:58:33,254 --> 00:58:34,839
Bwa. Spaghetti walls.

678
00:58:36,007 --> 00:58:37,550
Why did I bother coming to you?

679
00:58:37,675 --> 00:58:39,969
The dead are hunting us
down and you do nothing.

680
00:58:40,386 --> 00:58:41,920
Nothing, You call this nothing?

681
00:58:41,921 --> 00:58:43,640
You're drunk and you're sleeping.

682
00:58:43,723 --> 00:58:47,602
My point exactly, I am
doing two things at once.

683
00:58:47,894 --> 00:58:50,355
You can't save the unsavable mate.

684
00:58:51,814 --> 00:58:53,775
Like it or not Jack,
you're going to help me.

685
00:58:53,816 --> 00:58:55,777
I will break my father's curse.

686
00:58:58,321 --> 00:59:00,490
Next time you raise a sword, boy.

687
00:59:01,449 --> 00:59:03,535
Be the last to die.

688
00:59:15,435 --> 00:59:16,435
Ooh.

689
00:59:19,759 --> 00:59:23,638
Might I suggest you entice
her with a bit of flattery.

690
00:59:24,848 --> 00:59:26,683
I'm here for my
father, nothing more.

691
00:59:27,517 --> 00:59:30,395
I knew it, absolutely
smitten with her.

692
00:59:31,062 --> 00:59:34,566
Now, a bit of discretion
when courting a brunette.

693
00:59:34,607 --> 00:59:36,484
Never pursue her sister.

694
00:59:36,526 --> 00:59:39,946
But if you cannot avoid
the charming sister,

695
00:59:40,446 --> 00:59:42,532
kill the brother, savvy?

696
00:59:44,367 --> 00:59:46,077
No, I do not savvy.

697
00:59:48,121 --> 00:59:52,375
Who hurt you? By the way that
little sliver of knowledge...

698
00:59:52,458 --> 00:59:56,129
will cost you five pieces.
I'm not paying you for that.

699
00:59:56,170 --> 00:59:57,922
Never say that to a woman.

700
01:00:13,021 --> 01:00:14,751
Just because you
can't see something

701
01:00:14,752 --> 01:00:16,107
doesn't mean it's not there.

702
01:00:17,525 --> 01:00:18,693
Like the map?

703
01:00:20,862 --> 01:00:22,238
We have to find it.

704
01:00:23,448 --> 01:00:25,241
It's the only link to who I am.

705
01:00:25,992 --> 01:00:27,660
Who my father was.

706
01:00:29,037 --> 01:00:30,371
So we've both spent our lives,

707
01:00:30,413 --> 01:00:31,789
searching for our fathers.

708
01:00:33,291 --> 01:00:35,293
Perhaps you and I are
closer than you think.

709
01:00:52,185 --> 01:00:54,646
The sun is up. And
so is your time.

710
01:00:57,524 --> 01:00:59,984
And not to disagree, but the
precision of our accord,

711
01:01:00,109 --> 01:01:01,361
ends at sunrise.

712
01:01:01,402 --> 01:01:04,613
This be but first light, far
from a fully rising sun.

713
01:01:04,614 --> 01:01:06,553
And I know you to
be a man of honour.

714
01:01:06,554 --> 01:01:08,201
Honour, you know nothing of me.

715
01:01:08,243 --> 01:01:10,703
I know what it likes to be
bested by Jack Sparrow.

716
01:01:10,745 --> 01:01:14,082
- He's an enemy to us both.
- You don't know who I am.

717
01:01:15,708 --> 01:01:17,751
I've heard stories of a mighty

718
01:01:17,752 --> 01:01:20,338
Spanish captain. El
Matador Del Mar.

719
01:01:20,505 --> 01:01:24,591
A man who scourged the sea. Hunted
and killed thousands of men.

720
01:01:24,592 --> 01:01:25,927
No, no, no. Men, no, no.

721
01:01:25,969 --> 01:01:26,970
No.

722
01:01:27,637 --> 01:01:29,389
Pirates?

723
01:01:31,724 --> 01:01:33,017
Pirates.

724
01:01:38,439 --> 01:01:41,776
Pirates had infected the
seas for generations.

725
01:01:41,818 --> 01:01:45,071
Taken the life of my father
and his father before.

726
01:01:45,363 --> 01:01:48,783
So I vowed to end this
plague once and for all.

727
01:01:48,825 --> 01:01:52,245
And that's what I did, I
destroyed dozens of ships.

728
01:01:58,167 --> 01:02:02,297
The last ones joined together
to try and defeat me.

729
01:02:02,797 --> 01:02:05,383
But they soon realised
it was hopeless.

730
01:02:17,061 --> 01:02:19,689
Nothing could stop
the Silent Mary.

731
01:02:20,732 --> 01:02:22,567
Hit them below the water line.

732
01:02:22,609 --> 01:02:23,776
Vamo, vamo.

733
01:02:26,821 --> 01:02:29,157
Hang on tight.

734
01:02:37,790 --> 01:02:41,377
The sea was finally... pure.

735
01:02:42,295 --> 01:02:45,840
Their wretched flags would
no longer stain the sea.

736
01:02:54,390 --> 01:02:55,975
They are begging for mercy.

737
01:02:57,185 --> 01:02:59,854
Mercy? Mercy.

738
01:03:01,272 --> 01:03:02,690
There's no mercy.

739
01:03:08,947 --> 01:03:10,156
Make ready.

740
01:03:16,746 --> 01:03:18,873
- Adios.
- Fire.

741
01:03:28,007 --> 01:03:30,218
It's up to you now, Jack.

742
01:03:32,345 --> 01:03:36,516
This compass... points
towards what you want most.

743
01:03:38,643 --> 01:03:41,521
Never betray it.

744
01:04:12,677 --> 01:04:15,013
The Devil's Triangle.

745
01:04:16,389 --> 01:04:21,060
The last of their ships were
burning before my eyes.

746
01:04:22,604 --> 01:04:26,733
And in that moment of... victory.

747
01:04:27,192 --> 01:04:28,985
It's when I heard it.

748
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:30,361
Hey.

749
01:04:30,695 --> 01:04:32,822
Hold on, Capitan.

750
01:04:33,156 --> 01:04:36,326
One ship was trying to
escape through the smoke.

751
01:04:36,492 --> 01:04:38,912
It's a lovely day
for a sail, innit?

752
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:40,246
And there.

753
01:04:40,705 --> 01:04:45,668
In the crow's nest, there
was this young pirate boy.

754
01:04:45,710 --> 01:04:48,004
The way I see it, it's
just the two of us left.

755
01:04:48,796 --> 01:04:51,257
If you surrender to me now,
I'll let you live, simple.

756
01:04:51,299 --> 01:04:54,594
He stood there, looking
like... Like a little bird.

757
01:04:55,470 --> 01:04:58,181
And from that day he earned
himself a name that would...

758
01:04:58,389 --> 01:05:00,725
haunt me for the rest of my days.

759
01:05:02,602 --> 01:05:03,978
Jack de "Sparrow".

760
01:05:04,437 --> 01:05:08,233
Right then, you surrender to
me now, and I'll let you live.

761
01:05:09,567 --> 01:05:11,778
I shall let you live.

762
01:05:17,951 --> 01:05:19,244
This boy.

763
01:05:19,494 --> 01:05:21,829
This boy was mocking my power.

764
01:05:21,871 --> 01:05:24,999
So I chased him. Knowing
that I would run.

765
01:05:25,041 --> 01:05:27,497
My knife along his
neck, and when he

766
01:05:27,498 --> 01:05:29,754
was dead, I would finish finally.

767
01:05:29,796 --> 01:05:31,339
With pirates's life.

768
01:05:36,386 --> 01:05:37,512
Follow him men.

769
01:05:38,847 --> 01:05:41,432
To the gunnels. Grab some lines.

770
01:05:43,852 --> 01:05:45,395
Prepare the boot leg.

771
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:46,563
Port side.

772
01:05:48,773 --> 01:05:49,899
Throw it now.

773
01:06:12,088 --> 01:06:13,214
Boot leg turn.

774
01:07:23,034 --> 01:07:24,202
What's all this?

775
01:07:27,705 --> 01:07:30,208
Tribute... Sir.

776
01:08:00,113 --> 01:08:01,948
He took everything from me.

777
01:08:02,699 --> 01:08:05,702
And filled me with... rage.

778
01:08:08,454 --> 01:08:09,747
And pain.

779
01:08:11,749 --> 01:08:14,252
And here is where the tale ends.

780
01:08:16,838 --> 01:08:18,756
Not yet Capitan, there.

781
01:08:19,674 --> 01:08:21,384
Found as promised.

782
01:08:45,783 --> 01:08:47,535
So she's saying she's got the map,

783
01:08:47,577 --> 01:08:49,119
but she's the only one
who can follow it?

784
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:51,539
- So we should shoot her?
- Leave her be.

785
01:08:51,581 --> 01:08:52,841
She will take us to the Trident.

786
01:08:52,842 --> 01:08:54,249
You've been saying that for hours.

787
01:08:54,250 --> 01:08:57,795
Two things we know are true,
the stars don't shine by day.

788
01:08:57,962 --> 01:08:59,714
And she, forgot the donkey.

789
01:09:00,131 --> 01:09:04,260
How can we go to a spot, where
no land exists on any map?

790
01:09:05,845 --> 01:09:08,515
This chronometer keeps the
exact time in London.

791
01:09:08,848 --> 01:09:10,599
I'm using it to make an
altitude measurement.

792
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:12,101
To determine longitude.

793
01:09:12,685 --> 01:09:15,188
Only then will we find
our exact spot at sea.

794
01:09:15,230 --> 01:09:17,774
So you expect to find the
Trident with a timepiece?

795
01:09:17,857 --> 01:09:18,900
Yes.

796
01:09:19,651 --> 01:09:21,736
My calculations are
precise and true.

797
01:09:22,028 --> 01:09:23,404
I'm not only an astronomer.

798
01:09:23,446 --> 01:09:24,948
I am also a horologist.

799
01:09:30,411 --> 01:09:31,788
No shame in that dear.

800
01:09:32,038 --> 01:09:35,250
We'll all have to earn a living?

801
01:09:36,834 --> 01:09:39,795
No, I'm a horologist.

802
01:09:39,796 --> 01:09:42,757
So was my mum. But she didn't
crow about it as bad as you.

803
01:09:42,966 --> 01:09:45,343
You're saying your mother
was academically inclined?

804
01:09:45,385 --> 01:09:49,806
More like, err,
horizontally, reclined.

805
01:09:50,807 --> 01:09:53,142
Horology is the study of time.

806
01:09:53,184 --> 01:09:55,353
And she was always
looking at her watch.

807
01:09:55,603 --> 01:09:56,813
I can vouch for that.

808
01:09:58,648 --> 01:10:02,110
So no one can find the
X, but you, right?

809
01:10:02,402 --> 01:10:03,402
No.

810
01:10:03,403 --> 01:10:05,321
- And the donkey?
- Ship to the aft.

811
01:10:07,866 --> 01:10:08,867
Salazar.

812
01:10:13,162 --> 01:10:15,790
Jack, the dead will not rest
until they get their revenge.

813
01:10:15,832 --> 01:10:16,833
Dead?

814
01:10:16,875 --> 01:10:17,875
No, no, the dead

815
01:10:17,876 --> 01:10:20,461
- were never part of this deal.
- We should've never followed

816
01:10:20,503 --> 01:10:22,714
a luckless pirate
and a witch to sea.

817
01:10:22,755 --> 01:10:24,549
Right, that's it. Kill them all.

818
01:10:25,466 --> 01:10:28,428
Kill me and, and. I'll be dead.

819
01:10:28,928 --> 01:10:32,932
And then the other dead won't
be able to have their revenge.

820
01:10:33,933 --> 01:10:35,310
Against me,

821
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:37,145
- Being dead.
- What?

822
01:10:37,228 --> 01:10:39,147
- Which will anger them even more.
- He's right.

823
01:10:39,189 --> 01:10:40,189
That's right.

824
01:10:40,190 --> 01:10:41,940
Are all pirates this stupid?

825
01:10:41,941 --> 01:10:43,943
Yes.

826
01:10:44,027 --> 01:10:45,653
What are we going to do?

827
01:10:46,446 --> 01:10:47,614
As Captain.

828
01:10:48,907 --> 01:10:50,491
Might I suggest.

829
01:10:55,079 --> 01:10:57,165
Mutiny? You had to
suggest a mutiny?

830
01:10:57,207 --> 01:10:58,708
Carina, the dead are coming.

831
01:10:58,791 --> 01:11:02,170
Well. I choose not to believe
in supernatural nonsense.

832
01:11:02,212 --> 01:11:03,880
Do you not see what's behind us?

833
01:11:17,852 --> 01:11:19,687
- Drop them.
- Si.

834
01:11:19,729 --> 01:11:20,980
Drop them.

835
01:11:28,071 --> 01:11:29,071
What are you doing?

836
01:11:29,072 --> 01:11:30,614
Men on that ship are
looking for Jack.

837
01:11:30,615 --> 01:11:31,866
And Jack is on this boat.

838
01:11:31,908 --> 01:11:33,117
I'm going to swim for it.

839
01:11:33,201 --> 01:11:36,037
How dare you do exactly what
I would do if I were you?

840
01:11:36,162 --> 01:11:38,748
- Carina stop.
- No, no, no, don't stop.

841
01:11:38,998 --> 01:11:41,251
- This has gone far enough.
- No, it has not.

842
01:11:41,793 --> 01:11:44,712
Listen not to him,
carry on, carry on.

843
01:11:51,010 --> 01:11:54,389
- Ayy, she was almost finished.
- I saw her ankles.

844
01:11:54,472 --> 01:11:57,016
You'd have seen a lot more, if
you'd kept your cakehole shut.

845
01:12:15,159 --> 01:12:16,828
Kill the Sparrow.

846
01:12:33,678 --> 01:12:35,471
That's not good, is it?

847
01:12:36,306 --> 01:12:39,017
Keep rowing man. Faster. Faster.

848
01:12:39,184 --> 01:12:41,019
No, that's it.

849
01:12:42,145 --> 01:12:43,479
I'm going with her.

850
01:12:44,314 --> 01:12:47,609
You would leave me for some
horologist in her knickers?

851
01:12:47,650 --> 01:12:48,651
Yes.

852
01:12:50,153 --> 01:12:51,821
You men are all alike.

853
01:13:01,998 --> 01:13:02,999
Shark.

854
01:13:28,066 --> 01:13:29,150
Henry.

855
01:13:51,506 --> 01:13:52,881
Doesn't seem to be working.

856
01:13:52,882 --> 01:13:55,009
No, we'll be fine, we'll be fine.

857
01:14:01,509 --> 01:14:02,909
Vamos.

858
01:14:14,821 --> 01:14:16,906
- How do they do that?
- We have to swim for it.

859
01:14:17,115 --> 01:14:19,242
I'll distract them.

860
01:14:24,747 --> 01:14:25,748
Now.

861
01:15:06,372 --> 01:15:08,041
Henry.

862
01:15:58,716 --> 01:16:01,511
Hai. Jack Sparrow.

863
01:16:03,555 --> 01:16:05,265
Jack Sparrow.

864
01:16:05,306 --> 01:16:06,391
Spanish?

865
01:16:14,023 --> 01:16:15,567
- Ghosts.
- Ah-ow.

866
01:16:16,359 --> 01:16:18,444
They're unable to step on land.

867
01:16:19,195 --> 01:16:21,072
- I knew that though.
- Ghosts.

868
01:16:24,702 --> 01:16:25,702
Carina.

869
01:16:25,703 --> 01:16:28,204
You will soon pay for
what you did to me.

870
01:16:28,246 --> 01:16:30,665
No, no, no. There's no
need to bother really.

871
01:16:30,707 --> 01:16:32,417
- Carina.
- I have no time to chat.

872
01:16:32,458 --> 01:16:36,254
- Because me map's just run away.
- I will be waiting... for you.

873
01:16:36,796 --> 01:16:39,841
Why would you be waiting for me?
Why would he be waiting for me?

874
01:16:56,649 --> 01:16:57,817
Pirates.

875
01:17:12,582 --> 01:17:13,583
Scrum.

876
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Captain?

877
01:17:15,001 --> 01:17:16,427
Jack always told me
that if anything

878
01:17:16,428 --> 01:17:17,544
should ever happen to him...

879
01:17:17,545 --> 01:17:19,243
He wanted you to be captain.

880
01:17:19,244 --> 01:17:21,508
Yes, but the men
voted for you, yes?

881
01:17:21,549 --> 01:17:23,009
Well, you've got a captain's hat.

882
01:17:23,051 --> 01:17:25,386
"Be that as it may"
them were his wishes.

883
01:17:25,428 --> 01:17:27,597
So be a good lad and
take the wheel.

884
01:17:27,639 --> 01:17:28,765
And... you,

885
01:17:29,974 --> 01:17:31,921
Take the captain's hat.

886
01:17:31,922 --> 01:17:35,271
This is the proudest
moment of my li...

887
01:17:38,316 --> 01:17:40,108
We will beat your captain to death

888
01:17:40,109 --> 01:17:42,070
until he reveals where
they're heading.

889
01:17:44,614 --> 01:17:47,867
- Carina.
- I know what's ailing you boy.

890
01:17:47,909 --> 01:17:50,036
You've got the unscratchable itch.

891
01:17:50,370 --> 01:17:52,997
Carina is the only one who can
help us find the Trident.

892
01:17:53,122 --> 01:17:55,291
- And I'm not in love with her.
- Love?

893
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:57,668
Who said anything about love,
what are you talking about?

894
01:17:57,669 --> 01:17:58,711
The unscratchable itch.

895
01:17:59,045 --> 01:18:01,130
Scabies, I'm talking
about scabies.

896
01:18:01,172 --> 01:18:03,424
Small mites that
burrow under the skin.

897
01:18:03,675 --> 01:18:05,677
Certainly ailing me,
has done for years.

898
01:18:05,718 --> 01:18:06,845
Oh, no.

899
01:18:07,730 --> 01:18:09,070
Hangman's Bay,
STRANGERS NOT WELCOME.

900
01:18:09,514 --> 01:18:10,682
Help.

901
01:18:11,683 --> 01:18:14,060
- Help me. Help.
- Carina.

902
01:18:15,144 --> 01:18:17,689
- Henry, help me.
- Help her.

903
01:18:19,190 --> 01:18:20,650
By rule of the King,

904
01:18:20,692 --> 01:18:22,777
I sentence you all to death.

905
01:18:23,570 --> 01:18:28,156
I think we should tell each other
where our treasures are buried.

906
01:18:28,157 --> 01:18:30,159
Just in case one of us survives.

907
01:18:30,201 --> 01:18:31,452
Oh, good idea.

908
01:18:31,953 --> 01:18:35,123
- You go first.
- My treasure is buried.

909
01:18:35,164 --> 01:18:37,625
Between two crossed palm trees
in an unmarked grave in Aruba.

910
01:18:37,667 --> 01:18:40,003
What about yours?

911
01:18:41,171 --> 01:18:42,547
I haven't got any.

912
01:18:42,589 --> 01:18:44,299
You promised me Jack's blood.

913
01:18:44,340 --> 01:18:45,717
But Jack be trapped.

914
01:18:46,176 --> 01:18:49,470
- He can never escape that island.
- He's on land.

915
01:18:55,727 --> 01:18:56,728
Hello.

916
01:19:01,232 --> 01:19:02,817
I upheld our deal.

917
01:19:02,942 --> 01:19:04,736
Me men and myself will go ashore.

918
01:19:04,903 --> 01:19:06,988
The scurvy traitor will be yours.

919
01:19:07,322 --> 01:19:09,240
- On me honour.
- Honour?

920
01:19:09,824 --> 01:19:11,826
What honour, hombre? What honour?

921
01:19:11,951 --> 01:19:14,537
- You don't know what honour is.
- Spare me my life.

922
01:19:14,871 --> 01:19:17,207
And I'll fetch you the Sparrow.

923
01:19:17,384 --> 01:19:19,384
Tenemos un acuerdo...
(Do we have an accord?)

924
01:19:19,584 --> 01:19:20,960
An accord?

925
01:19:34,070 --> 01:19:37,620
Wake up Sparrow.

926
01:19:40,950 --> 01:19:43,700
Wake up Sparrow.

927
01:19:45,540 --> 01:19:47,080
Wake up, Sparrow.

928
01:19:48,738 --> 01:19:52,575
- It's time to pay your debt.
- Pig?

929
01:19:53,409 --> 01:19:54,452
Pig Kelly?

930
01:19:55,703 --> 01:19:58,665
- Me old mate.
- Mate?

931
01:19:58,998 --> 01:20:00,667
Do you hear that boys?

932
01:20:01,292 --> 01:20:04,629
This lying pirate owes
me a plunder of silver.

933
01:20:04,671 --> 01:20:07,674
And luck has brought
him to Hangman's Bay.

934
01:20:07,715 --> 01:20:10,718
Where he can settle his
debt, here and now.

935
01:20:11,636 --> 01:20:14,722
And I will, I will
Pig. Name your price.

936
01:20:14,764 --> 01:20:17,559
Her name is Beatrice.

937
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:23,064
And she's my poor widowed sister.

938
01:20:25,900 --> 01:20:27,235
What, what is that?

939
01:20:27,277 --> 01:20:29,195
She's been looking for
a respectable man.

940
01:20:30,154 --> 01:20:32,740
- But you'll have to do.
- Royce, let's get on with this.

941
01:20:32,866 --> 01:20:34,617
No why? Why...?

942
01:20:34,701 --> 01:20:37,203
To make an honest
woman of her, Jack.

943
01:20:37,287 --> 01:20:40,039
Congratulations, it's
your wedding day.

944
01:20:41,332 --> 01:20:42,332
Let us begin?

945
01:20:42,333 --> 01:20:45,128
We'll honeymoon in the barn.

946
01:20:49,507 --> 01:20:52,010
No, no, no. Now Pig.

947
01:20:52,051 --> 01:20:55,263
How can I honestly make an
honest woman out of it?

948
01:20:55,305 --> 01:20:57,182
That, her. I mean. Her.

949
01:21:00,894 --> 01:21:03,438
- What are those things?
- Our children.

950
01:21:04,063 --> 01:21:06,232
Best not look them in the eye.

951
01:21:06,316 --> 01:21:08,484
Bring the best man
and the bridesmaid.

952
01:21:09,944 --> 01:21:11,279
I looked it in the eye.

953
01:21:11,321 --> 01:21:13,573
Place your hand on the Bible.

954
01:21:14,407 --> 01:21:16,409
- I've got scabies.
- So do I.

955
01:21:17,410 --> 01:21:19,579
Place your hand on the Bible.

956
01:21:20,288 --> 01:21:21,581
I'm a bed wetter.

957
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:23,458
Say I do.

958
01:21:24,542 --> 01:21:26,237
Or I'll put a bullet
in your skull.

959
01:21:26,238 --> 01:21:27,754
Jack, they're going to kill us.

960
01:21:27,795 --> 01:21:29,380
- I don't care.
- Just say I do.

961
01:21:29,464 --> 01:21:32,175
- Last chance Jack.
- Wait. Surely.

962
01:21:32,425 --> 01:21:35,011
- This is not legal.
- This is not legal.

963
01:21:35,345 --> 01:21:36,471
He's right.

964
01:21:36,554 --> 01:21:38,973
Does any man here object
to these nuptials?

965
01:21:39,557 --> 01:21:42,185
- I do.
- Congratulations.

966
01:21:42,227 --> 01:21:43,770
You may kiss the bride.

967
01:21:56,241 --> 01:21:59,569
- Do you like seafood, do you?
- Come on.

968
01:22:02,789 --> 01:22:05,083
Jack. We meet again.

969
01:22:06,167 --> 01:22:07,293
Hector.

970
01:22:07,585 --> 01:22:10,129
This is me bestest mate
in the whole world.

971
01:22:10,171 --> 01:22:12,924
I always knew you'd
settle down, eventually.

972
01:22:12,966 --> 01:22:14,342
Did you bring me a gift?

973
01:22:16,636 --> 01:22:17,887
That'll do.

974
01:22:20,265 --> 01:22:23,810
You look marvellous. Got
quite a spring in your step.

975
01:22:24,894 --> 01:22:26,229
Has your leg grown back?

976
01:22:26,354 --> 01:22:28,690
Captain, shouldn't we be
getting back to Salazar.

977
01:22:28,982 --> 01:22:31,359
Trade Mr Sparrow's
life in for our own?

978
01:22:31,651 --> 01:22:35,697
Ay, that we could. But I've come
for the Trident of Poseidon.

979
01:22:36,656 --> 01:22:38,241
You're gonna double
cross the dead?

980
01:22:38,324 --> 01:22:39,409
You did promise.

981
01:22:39,617 --> 01:22:43,538
And with it I'll gut the dead
that stole my command of the sea.

982
01:22:43,621 --> 01:22:45,707
As much as I love this plan.

983
01:22:45,957 --> 01:22:49,627
No vessel can outrun that
wretched hull of a ship.

984
01:22:49,669 --> 01:22:51,296
But there be one, Jack.

985
01:22:51,337 --> 01:22:52,755
The fastest ship I know.

986
01:22:52,797 --> 01:22:56,676
The Pearl, trapped in that
bottle by Blackbeard.

987
01:22:56,759 --> 01:22:58,428
Five winters ago.

988
01:23:00,305 --> 01:23:03,349
By the power of that
blaggard's sovereign blade.

989
01:23:03,433 --> 01:23:08,938
I hereby release the Black Pearl,
to her former and rightful glory.

990
01:23:19,908 --> 01:23:21,201
Get rid of the.

991
01:23:23,786 --> 01:23:24,786
It's coming.

992
01:23:24,787 --> 01:23:26,706
It's coming. It's coming. Coming.

993
01:23:31,711 --> 01:23:34,130
Stand aside. Stand aside.

994
01:23:35,632 --> 01:23:37,050
It's coming.

995
01:23:52,732 --> 01:23:54,234
It's shrunken.

996
01:23:54,859 --> 01:23:56,528
Why doesn't it unshrink?

997
01:23:57,529 --> 01:23:59,113
Maybe it's cold.

998
01:23:59,239 --> 01:24:00,782
She needs the sea.

999
01:24:15,088 --> 01:24:16,714
She was a fine ship.

1000
01:24:55,295 --> 01:24:57,922
There be room for
only one captain.

1001
01:25:00,550 --> 01:25:04,137
- Filthy beast.
- Time to race the dead.

1002
01:25:10,935 --> 01:25:13,146
The only safe place is the land.

1003
01:25:13,271 --> 01:25:15,064
Why are we going
away from the land?

1004
01:25:15,523 --> 01:25:16,524
Anyone?

1005
01:25:17,066 --> 01:25:19,444
Captain, your map is incomplete.

1006
01:25:19,736 --> 01:25:22,488
I can take us to the Trident,
if you'd only trust me.

1007
01:25:23,489 --> 01:25:25,658
Did you not hear
anything I just said?

1008
01:25:26,034 --> 01:25:27,202
So you be saying that

1009
01:25:27,243 --> 01:25:29,746
that star is pretending
to be a map?

1010
01:25:29,913 --> 01:25:32,332
Sir, there is no
island, on any map,

1011
01:25:32,373 --> 01:25:34,292
to support what the woman says.

1012
01:25:34,334 --> 01:25:36,169
Captain, you don't have
to understand her.

1013
01:25:36,336 --> 01:25:37,795
Just believe her.

1014
01:25:38,922 --> 01:25:40,340
Anyone?

1015
01:25:52,435 --> 01:25:55,813
We had something sharp,
I could pick that lock.

1016
01:25:57,190 --> 01:25:59,192
You're not gonna find
anything sharp in here.

1017
01:26:05,892 --> 01:26:08,492
Keep still, ya bilge rat.

1018
01:26:09,392 --> 01:26:11,892
Captain. Oh please, I don't
wanna be Captain any more.

1019
01:26:21,589 --> 01:26:22,632
Release them.

1020
01:26:24,884 --> 01:26:29,305
Sir, you wouldn't allow a
woman to steer your ship?

1021
01:26:29,347 --> 01:26:32,559
She will follow her star.
Or we'll all die together.

1022
01:26:52,203 --> 01:26:55,206
The Black Pearl. She sails again.

1023
01:26:55,248 --> 01:26:57,083
Yeah.

1024
01:26:58,293 --> 01:27:00,920
This ship. Those ghosts.

1025
01:27:01,921 --> 01:27:03,715
There can be no
logical explanation.

1026
01:27:03,756 --> 01:27:05,800
The myths of the sea
are real, Carina.

1027
01:27:06,134 --> 01:27:08,178
I'm glad you can finally
see you were wrong.

1028
01:27:08,303 --> 01:27:09,304
Wrong?

1029
01:27:11,431 --> 01:27:12,765
Perhaps I had some doubts.

1030
01:27:12,807 --> 01:27:14,684
This is the worst apology
I've ever heard.

1031
01:27:14,767 --> 01:27:16,519
Apology? Why would I apologise?

1032
01:27:16,603 --> 01:27:18,854
Because we've been chased by
the dead, sailing on a ship,

1033
01:27:18,855 --> 01:27:21,065
raised from a bottle. Where
is your science in that?

1034
01:27:21,107 --> 01:27:23,526
Fine, I will apologise.

1035
01:27:24,194 --> 01:27:25,194
Go on, then.

1036
01:27:25,195 --> 01:27:27,154
Well then, one could argue
that you owe me an apology.

1037
01:27:27,155 --> 01:27:29,908
As my life has been threatened
by pirates and dead man.

1038
01:27:29,949 --> 01:27:32,118
Which you now believe
in, sorry to say.

1039
01:27:32,452 --> 01:27:33,703
Apology accepted.

1040
01:27:35,830 --> 01:27:37,290
I'm going to the lookout.

1041
01:27:37,874 --> 01:27:39,584
I'm glad you see it my way.

1042
01:27:45,784 --> 01:27:47,284
12 degrees to port.

1043
01:27:49,135 --> 01:27:51,846
- Ready the guns.
- Aye. Ready the guns.

1044
01:27:51,888 --> 01:27:53,973
Those pirates are going
for the Trident.

1045
01:28:08,655 --> 01:28:10,782
Where did you get that from Missy?

1046
01:28:11,449 --> 01:28:14,577
I know this book, stolen
from an Italian ship,

1047
01:28:14,619 --> 01:28:16,788
- many years ago.
- Stolen?

1048
01:28:17,163 --> 01:28:18,456
No, you're mistaken.

1049
01:28:18,498 --> 01:28:20,333
There was a ruby on the cover...

1050
01:28:20,375 --> 01:28:22,418
I would not soon forget.

1051
01:28:25,630 --> 01:28:27,549
This was given to me by my father.

1052
01:28:27,590 --> 01:28:29,717
He was clearly a man of science.

1053
01:28:31,719 --> 01:28:33,847
He was clearly a common thief.

1054
01:28:35,265 --> 01:28:37,225
The memory of my father
will not be befouled...

1055
01:28:37,267 --> 01:28:38,810
by the tongue of a pirate.

1056
01:28:39,519 --> 01:28:41,354
This diary is my birth right.

1057
01:28:41,729 --> 01:28:43,898
Left to me on the steps
of a children's home.

1058
01:28:44,482 --> 01:28:46,234
Along with a name
and nothing else.

1059
01:28:46,526 --> 01:28:48,319
Oh, so you're an orphan?

1060
01:28:49,362 --> 01:28:50,780
What be you called?

1061
01:28:52,949 --> 01:28:55,201
Brightest star in the
north gave me my name.

1062
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:05,253
- That would be Carina?
- Carina Smyth.

1063
01:29:07,130 --> 01:29:11,259
- So, you do know your stars?
- I'm a Captain.

1064
01:29:14,721 --> 01:29:17,557
I know which stars to follow home.

1065
01:30:00,683 --> 01:30:02,018
Smyth?

1066
01:30:03,019 --> 01:30:05,480
Smyth is quite an unusual name.

1067
01:30:06,689 --> 01:30:10,235
Did we not once know
someone, called Smyth?

1068
01:30:10,318 --> 01:30:11,611
Shut your trap.

1069
01:30:11,736 --> 01:30:13,238
What was her name.

1070
01:30:13,821 --> 01:30:15,615
It's right on the
tip of me tongue.

1071
01:30:15,990 --> 01:30:17,784
Do you wanna loose that tongue?

1072
01:30:17,825 --> 01:30:18,910
Margaret Smyth.

1073
01:30:20,411 --> 01:30:22,539
Aye, shall we make an accord then?

1074
01:30:22,956 --> 01:30:25,458
Or, shall I tell you know who.

1075
01:30:25,917 --> 01:30:28,044
What we both know to be true.

1076
01:30:28,086 --> 01:30:30,588
We both take the
secret to our graves.

1077
01:30:30,630 --> 01:30:32,465
You mean, it is true?
I was bluffing.

1078
01:30:32,507 --> 01:30:33,507
I'm not.

1079
01:30:33,508 --> 01:30:36,678
You kill me, you got nothing
to bargain the dead with.

1080
01:30:37,136 --> 01:30:38,930
So you need me.

1081
01:30:40,014 --> 01:30:44,769
I'll have to be frank Hector.
You are very, very ugly.

1082
01:30:44,811 --> 01:30:49,148
So how could you produce a
fetching creature such as that?

1083
01:30:49,566 --> 01:30:51,025
Margaret died.

1084
01:30:51,144 --> 01:30:52,744
I summoned as much honour

1085
01:30:52,944 --> 01:30:54,529
as a worthless
blaggard ever could.

1086
01:30:54,904 --> 01:30:58,491
I placed the infant in an
orphanage, never to see her again.

1087
01:30:58,741 --> 01:31:01,536
I thought the ruby might
afford her some easy life.

1088
01:31:01,578 --> 01:31:04,038
But I never imagined she'd
take those scribblings.

1089
01:31:04,289 --> 01:31:05,874
And make a life of her own.

1090
01:31:07,167 --> 01:31:09,294
Life that's led her back to me.

1091
01:31:12,046 --> 01:31:17,135
I'd say this puts me in a rather
favourable position, daddy.

1092
01:31:17,177 --> 01:31:19,679
- Tell me what you want.
- I want me compass.

1093
01:31:20,555 --> 01:31:25,894
216 barrels of rum. And a monkey.

1094
01:31:26,644 --> 01:31:28,687
- You want Jack?
- Dinner.

1095
01:31:28,688 --> 01:31:30,648
I want to eat him. I
want to eat that monkey.

1096
01:31:31,274 --> 01:31:34,110
No deal Jack. A clever
young woman such as that,

1097
01:31:34,152 --> 01:31:38,489
would never believe that a swine
like me could ever be her blood.

1098
01:31:41,451 --> 01:31:43,745
And the Trident will be mine.

1099
01:31:54,506 --> 01:31:55,840
Redcoats.

1100
01:31:57,133 --> 01:31:58,384
Redcoats.

1101
01:32:01,304 --> 01:32:03,473
Prepare to fire.

1102
01:32:03,515 --> 01:32:05,141
Prepare to fire.

1103
01:32:05,541 --> 01:32:06,741
Man the guns.

1104
01:32:12,148 --> 01:32:14,400
She comes starboard.

1105
01:32:14,984 --> 01:32:16,945
We shall fight to the last.

1106
01:32:17,153 --> 01:32:20,281
The Pearl will not be
taken from me again.

1107
01:32:25,078 --> 01:32:26,204
Sir.

1108
01:32:31,084 --> 01:32:34,671
Only the British Empire will
hold the power of the sea.

1109
01:33:08,955 --> 01:33:12,208
What ever happens,
stay your course.

1110
01:33:38,026 --> 01:33:42,739
Jack Sparrow? Jack Sparrow?

1111
01:33:42,780 --> 01:33:45,033
I've come with the butcher's bill.

1112
01:33:49,496 --> 01:33:50,747
Where is he?

1113
01:33:53,875 --> 01:33:58,129
Defend yourselves
men. To the death.

1114
01:33:59,964 --> 01:34:03,718
Hurry up man, what did you...
sharpen it with butter?

1115
01:34:24,656 --> 01:34:26,199
There's nowhere to hide.

1116
01:34:41,798 --> 01:34:44,551
Let's be brave, save the Pearl.

1117
01:34:53,852 --> 01:34:55,228
This has to be it.

1118
01:34:58,273 --> 01:35:00,900
- It has to be here.
- Find that land.

1119
01:35:00,984 --> 01:35:02,902
Or we'll all die.

1120
01:35:03,152 --> 01:35:04,487
We're nearly there.

1121
01:35:05,071 --> 01:35:07,031
It's here somewhere.

1122
01:36:28,279 --> 01:36:30,364
Have you found what you're
looking for yet, miss?

1123
01:36:30,365 --> 01:36:31,616
I'm trying.

1124
01:36:35,995 --> 01:36:37,580
The stars will soon be gone.

1125
01:37:07,777 --> 01:37:08,778
Carina.

1126
01:37:09,195 --> 01:37:12,448
Henry. Look, the island is there.

1127
01:37:13,032 --> 01:37:14,409
You found it.

1128
01:37:25,128 --> 01:37:26,212
The island.

1129
01:37:32,010 --> 01:37:33,094
Land.

1130
01:37:34,512 --> 01:37:35,889
Get to the midding.

1131
01:37:52,197 --> 01:37:53,489
Carina.

1132
01:38:09,589 --> 01:38:11,049
Carina.

1133
01:38:14,093 --> 01:38:15,470
Henry.

1134
01:38:29,025 --> 01:38:30,026
They took Henry.

1135
01:38:30,193 --> 01:38:32,654
The Trident be all
that can save him now.

1136
01:38:32,862 --> 01:38:34,322
Then we have to find it.

1137
01:38:54,259 --> 01:38:55,593
Where is it?

1138
01:39:00,265 --> 01:39:01,683
It has to be here.

1139
01:39:33,756 --> 01:39:35,049
Look at it Jack.

1140
01:39:35,967 --> 01:39:38,303
It's the most beautiful
thing I've ever seen.

1141
01:39:38,636 --> 01:39:40,930
This is what my father
wanted me to find.

1142
01:39:40,972 --> 01:39:41,972
The rocks?

1143
01:39:41,973 --> 01:39:45,059
No, no. Not rocks, stars.

1144
01:39:45,435 --> 01:39:47,729
This is the map no man can read.

1145
01:39:49,105 --> 01:39:53,151
This island is a perfect
reflection of the heavens.

1146
01:40:00,658 --> 01:40:03,369
One star's missing, quickly.

1147
01:40:04,496 --> 01:40:06,664
We have to find the
Trident to save Henry.

1148
01:40:06,915 --> 01:40:07,916
Hector.

1149
01:40:07,957 --> 01:40:10,001
I think you should know,
she's a horologist.

1150
01:40:38,196 --> 01:40:39,489
Why isn't it glowing?

1151
01:40:41,157 --> 01:40:42,700
Finish it, Carina.

1152
01:40:49,249 --> 01:40:50,500
The missing star.

1153
01:40:52,293 --> 01:40:53,670
For my father.

1154
01:40:55,129 --> 01:40:56,214
Aye.

1155
01:40:57,674 --> 01:40:58,800
Do it for him.

1156
01:42:30,099 --> 01:42:31,100
There.

1157
01:42:31,976 --> 01:42:35,146
- Posiedon's tomb.
- This way.

1158
01:42:38,358 --> 01:42:39,358
Capitan.

1159
01:42:39,359 --> 01:42:41,152
You know the danger. Don't do it.

1160
01:42:41,361 --> 01:42:44,239
We have no choice. Jack is on
land going for the Trident.

1161
01:42:44,280 --> 01:42:45,865
Capitan, there must
be another way.

1162
01:42:45,949 --> 01:42:47,158
Once you possess the living,

1163
01:42:47,242 --> 01:42:49,869
there is no coming back. You
will be trapped in his body.

1164
01:42:49,911 --> 01:42:50,954
Forever.

1165
01:42:50,995 --> 01:42:52,747
The Trident will set me free.

1166
01:42:55,792 --> 01:42:58,503
- Time to kill a Sparrow.
- No.

1167
01:43:12,517 --> 01:43:15,562
- Look Jack, there it is.
- The Trident.

1168
01:43:22,193 --> 01:43:23,653
Jack.

1169
01:44:01,941 --> 01:44:04,194
You cut me, you cut the boy, Jack.

1170
01:44:39,979 --> 01:44:41,898
- Henry.
- No.

1171
01:45:13,555 --> 01:45:15,682
Hola, Sparrow.

1172
01:45:16,808 --> 01:45:17,809
No.

1173
01:45:29,529 --> 01:45:32,282
Sparrow, Sparrow.

1174
01:45:33,575 --> 01:45:35,660
No.

1175
01:45:39,789 --> 01:45:43,126
Henry, you've woken
him up. Please.

1176
01:45:43,376 --> 01:45:44,544
Henry wake up.

1177
01:45:46,671 --> 01:45:48,089
Oh, piss off.

1178
01:45:57,891 --> 01:45:59,726
Henry. Wake up, he's killing Jack.

1179
01:46:10,737 --> 01:46:11,738
Henry.

1180
01:46:12,322 --> 01:46:14,115
- Power of the sea.
- What?

1181
01:46:14,782 --> 01:46:18,369
- The power of the sea.
- To release the power of the sea.

1182
01:46:18,786 --> 01:46:20,079
All must divide.

1183
01:46:26,544 --> 01:46:28,546
If the Trident holds
all the power, then...

1184
01:46:28,588 --> 01:46:30,215
Then every curse is held inside.

1185
01:46:31,216 --> 01:46:33,134
As I told you before.

1186
01:46:33,343 --> 01:46:36,346
Surrender to me now.
And I will let you...

1187
01:46:37,305 --> 01:46:40,266
- Live.
- Do you want me to surrender?

1188
01:46:42,393 --> 01:46:45,730
- Maybe.
- This is where the trail ends.

1189
01:46:48,149 --> 01:46:49,275
No.

1190
01:47:02,372 --> 01:47:03,373
Divide.

1191
01:47:03,623 --> 01:47:04,707
Henry.

1192
01:47:07,001 --> 01:47:08,253
Henry. Divide.

1193
01:47:08,294 --> 01:47:09,294
Break.

1194
01:47:09,295 --> 01:47:11,381
Break the Trident and you'll
break every curse at sea.

1195
01:47:11,464 --> 01:47:13,716
Adios, Sparrow.

1196
01:47:59,429 --> 01:48:00,972
All curses have broken.

1197
01:48:09,814 --> 01:48:11,107
Yes.

1198
01:48:41,179 --> 01:48:44,516
- The Pearl. My Pearl.
- Climb.

1199
01:48:44,766 --> 01:48:47,060
Move, fast.

1200
01:48:50,522 --> 01:48:53,441
Hold it steady boys,
don't let it slip.

1201
01:48:58,446 --> 01:48:59,989
Jack.

1202
01:49:02,867 --> 01:49:04,327
Faster.

1203
01:49:16,881 --> 01:49:19,259
Lift, anchor.

1204
01:49:19,551 --> 01:49:21,594
Get the anchor up, quick.

1205
01:49:21,636 --> 01:49:22,636
Stop, stop, bring it up.

1206
01:49:22,637 --> 01:49:24,848
Bring it up.

1207
01:49:42,282 --> 01:49:45,243
Capitan.

1208
01:50:10,476 --> 01:50:12,020
Oh, crap.

1209
01:50:33,333 --> 01:50:34,834
I've got ya.

1210
01:50:56,689 --> 01:50:58,525
Who am I to you?

1211
01:51:01,236 --> 01:51:02,779
Treasure.

1212
01:51:13,456 --> 01:51:14,541
Hold on.

1213
01:51:18,378 --> 01:51:19,504
Hector.

1214
01:52:34,913 --> 01:52:36,539
More to starboard.

1215
01:53:02,398 --> 01:53:04,359
Pirate's life, Hector.

1216
01:53:40,645 --> 01:53:41,688
You were right.

1217
01:53:43,398 --> 01:53:44,482
I don't know.

1218
01:53:45,108 --> 01:53:47,360
For a moment I had
everything, Henry.

1219
01:53:49,612 --> 01:53:51,281
Now it's all gone again.

1220
01:53:51,489 --> 01:53:54,033
It's not all gone, Smyth.

1221
01:54:07,422 --> 01:54:11,926
Barbossa... My name is Barbossa.

1222
01:54:53,927 --> 01:54:56,930
- Maybe Jack was right.
- About what?

1223
01:54:57,680 --> 01:54:59,474
The unscratchable itch.

1224
01:55:03,144 --> 01:55:04,521
Why did you do that for?

1225
01:55:04,604 --> 01:55:06,356
Just checking it's truly you.

1226
01:55:06,606 --> 01:55:08,233
That you're not still a ghost.

1227
01:55:09,150 --> 01:55:11,569
- It's me.
- Then I was.

1228
01:55:11,611 --> 01:55:13,988
- Wrong.
- Slightly in error.

1229
01:55:14,447 --> 01:55:15,573
Although one...

1230
01:55:22,121 --> 01:55:23,623
Apology accepted.

1231
01:55:37,262 --> 01:55:38,721
The Dutchman.

1232
01:56:14,174 --> 01:56:17,343
- Henry?
- Yes father.

1233
01:56:26,186 --> 01:56:28,146
Oh, look at you son.

1234
01:56:32,609 --> 01:56:33,902
How did you do it?

1235
01:56:35,945 --> 01:56:38,698
- How did you break the curse?
- Let me tell you a tale.

1236
01:56:39,407 --> 01:56:41,868
The tale of the greatest
treasure known to man.

1237
