1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,074

2
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:13,577
James and Cynthia Green?

3
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:15,455
- Yes.
- Right this way, please.

4
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:35,471
Okay.
James and Cynthia Green.

5
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:37,602
Thirteen Oak Lane Road, Stanleyville.

6
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:38,773
Yeah.

7
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:43,362
Wait. You didn't answer
what makes you qualified.

8
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:46,448
Oh, we know.
There wasn't much space.

9
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,025
We had so much to say.

10
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,406
Also here on page four.

11
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:52,529
In response to,

12
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:53,910
"What experience or experiences

13
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:55,536
"have best prepared you,"

14
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:58,744
you only wrote "Timothy."

15
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,462
Yes.

16
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,965
The only chance
you two have is

17
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:09,888
if you put it all on the table.

18
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,180
We agree.

19
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:15,098
That's why we want
to use our time to tell you our story.

20
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:17,729
Okay.

21
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,186
There's just one thing.

22
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,393
You're going to find it hard to believe.

23
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,907
This all began last September.

24
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:30,697
We'd been trying for a number of years,

25
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:32,995
and Dr. Hunt finally gave us the news.

26
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:37,579
First of all, you couldn't
have tried harder.

27
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:39,418
Or done more.

28
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:45,083
We have explored every medical option
at a great cost to you.

29
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,460
But there comes a point when you...

30
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,716
You have to accept...

31
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,933
I am so sorry.

32
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:58,186
Hold it!

33
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:03,484
Come on, honey. Come on. Come on.

34
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:08,689
Oh! Can you push the button for me?
Push it right there.

35
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:11,616
Good job! What would I do without you?

36
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:12,784
High-five!

37
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:23,204
So we drove back home.

38
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:34,010
We went back to work
and on with our day.

39
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,936
We'll get 8 puppy.

40
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:48,479
I don't want a puppy!

41
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:47,795
- Bye.
- Bye.

42
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:10,818
Hey, Tommy.

43
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:13,317
Here you go. I'll see you inside.

44
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,241
Good job.

45
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,167
Like all good stories,

46
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:27,370
the Stanleyville pencil factory,

47
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:31,294
this museum and
this town begins with a dream.

48
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,008
Stanley Crudstaff, our patron.

49
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:36,212
This is his original desk over here.
Please follow me.

50
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:17,677
You hungry?

51
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:26,936
Hey, sis!

52
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:29,231
Uh, just checking in to make sure
you're still up for tomorrow.

53
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:31,229
We'd be willing to host.

54
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:33,902
The kids just bought Bart a new grill.
You wouldn't believe it.

55
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,490
Hi, this is Allen Rust
with the Sisters of Mercy Hospital.

56
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:42,365
Please call me back about
an outstanding balance. Thank you.

57
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:11,185
Honey.

58
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:24,786
We're moving on.

59
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,222
You can see we've
got some dirt here.

60
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,298
But in order to
make good growing soil...

61
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:48,886
...and a good growing bed
for your garden,

62
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,939
you've got to get down
a good 12 to 18 inches.

63
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:55,058
I can't do it. I can't move on.

64
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:58,278
Then move out of the way.

65
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:04,401
For years, we've been thinking about

66
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,486
what our kid would have been like.

67
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:07,783
Don't.

68
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,079
We can move on tomorrow.

69
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,283
Just for tonight,

70
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,832
can we have a kid?

71
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,834
You heard what the doctor said.

72
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,210
Give it up! Give it up.

73
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:21,384
There we go. Never give up!

74
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:26,924
Our kid

75
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:30,848
would never give up.

76
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:36,100
You know what else I think?

77
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,567
- I can't.
- Our kid

78
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,358
would have your good heart.

79
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:43,941
This isn't funny, Jim.

80
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,321
But our kid would be funny.

81
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:49,909
Not make fun of other people funny,

82
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:52,115
or burp and fart funny,

83
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,792
but funny like...

84
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:58,004
Funny like Uncle Bub.

85
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,461
Funny like Uncle Bub.

86
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,225
You know that, uh,

87
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:22,066
that kind of kid that you always believe.

88
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:24,193
Someone honest.
You want a truth-teller.

89
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,239
Yeah, I do. I want one like that.

90
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:26,407
But our kid can't be perfect.

91
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:27,860
I don't want one of
those annoying perfect kids.

92
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:28,943
How about this?

93
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:30,529
Honest to a fault.

94
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:32,330
- Yes! We have a winner.
- Yes! Yes!

95
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,913
- Would our kid be musical?
- Definitely.

96
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,915
Clarinet like me, drums like you, or...

97
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,962
I don't know what kind of instrument.

98
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:42,291
All I know is our kid...

99
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:44,375
Our kid would rock!

100
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,052
- Ah! We so agree.
- Our kid would rock!

101
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:47,174
Write that.

102
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:49,764
Artistically.

103
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,182
Picasso with a pencil.

104
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,383
Yes.

105
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:55,346
A glass half-full person.

106
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,480
Love and be loved.

107
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,726
How great an athlete are you picturing?

108
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:02,193
You were terrible at soccer.

109
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,565
That's not true.

110
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,067
Not true.

111
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,443
I was a big klutz.

112
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,408
All right.
How about this? How about this?

113
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:11,953
Just once, our kid,

114
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,621
amazing kid.

115
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:16,412
Got to score the winning goal.

116
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:26,384
Touchdown! Go, Green!

117
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,257
Yes! That's our kid!

118
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,555
Now what?

119
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,732
We got some rain.

120
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:18,533
Everything is going to be fine.

121
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:21,619
Honey, did you say something?

122
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,322
I said we...

123
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:27,291
What?

124
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:59,282
I think it's gone.

125
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:02,614
Jim.

126
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,954
Wait. Wait.

127
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:33,815
Oh!

128
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:49,828
Hi.

129
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,542
- Hi.
- Hi.

130
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:56,547
I'm Timothy.

131
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,262
That's a common name.

132
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,805
Well, can we get you cleaned up?

133
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:12,392
Yeah, um, do you have a towel?

134
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:14,732
- Yeah, we do.
- Yeah.

135
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,197
This feels about right.

136
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:27,328
911.
State your emergency.

137
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,371
Yeah, I'd like to report a missing...

138
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:31,950
This is Jim Green. 13 Oak Lane Road.

139
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,623
Hey, Jim. It's Marty from the factory.

140
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,545
I'm just picking up a few extra hours.

141
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:37,918
Oh, Marty.

142
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,838
We have in our possession a...

143
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:44,387
Ah, God, I don't know how to say this.

144
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:48,216
Has anybody reported a missing...

145
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:55,766
Jim? Jim, are you there?

146
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:58,442
I ran away from home once.

147
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:00,861
I can't remember why.

148
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,689
And I didn't get very far.

149
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:06,446
What about you?

150
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:09,863
Did you run away?

151
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:11,660
No.

152
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:14,584
Come on.

153
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:16,661
I bet your parents are worried and

154
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,335
wondering.

155
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:25,962
Cindy!

156
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:27,672
Honey!

157
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:30,342
There's something you need to see.

158
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,472
Actually there's something
you need to see.

159
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:37,978
Hi.

160
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:41,231
Well, look who cleaned up good.

161
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:43,479
Er...

162
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:45,982
Mmm.

163
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:48,776
Hmm!

164
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:50,319
Hmm?

165
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:51,404
Hmm.

166
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,338
- Are those...
- Yes. Mmm-hmm.

167
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,503
Please don't ask about my leaves.

168
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:07,924
- Okay.
- No.

169
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:09,380
But you can look at them.

170
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:11,678
If you want.

171
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:32,370
Not everybody has these.

172
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:34,788
Yep.

173
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,416
Do you mind

174
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:38,663
if I...

175
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:45,003
Sorry.

176
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:53,971
Now my mind is racing
with even more questions.

177
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,553
Honey, you need to go look out back.

178
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,403
I'll just be right outside.

179
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:14,533
Hi.

180
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:16,618
Hi.

181
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:57,537
on.

182
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:29,812
Oh.

183
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:31,947
Oh, hey! Donnie!

184
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,653
False alarm!

185
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:35,901
We thought we had a burglar.

186
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,618
It was just a raccoon family

187
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:41,745
that we, we...
I chased it away, so everything's...

188
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:43,663
- Everything's fine.
- You sure?

189
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:46,583
Yeah, we're sure. Everything's good.

190
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,498
Jim, is there something
you're not telling us'?

191
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:49,582
Yeah.

192
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:50,837
Uh. no. Why?

193
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:56,131
Come on, Jim. We're on
strict water rationing.

194
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,098
Turn in your sprinkler,
and we'll let this one slide.

195
00:20:58,674 --> 00:20:59,766
But it rained.

196
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:03,228
No, it didn't.

197
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,182
Unless it only rained in your yard.

198
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,112
What do you know?

199
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:13,856
Amazing, huh?

200
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,992
Well, Green, it's your lucky day.

201
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:20,161
Yes, it is.

202
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:23,908
There you go. You had the right idea.

203
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:26,835
Back in there, back in there. All right.

204
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:29,872
Thank you.

205
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:31,707
You're welcome.

206
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:38,093
We really like to eat fresh, healthy food
here. A lot of vegetables

207
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:39,799
from our own garden.

208
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:41,555
I guess I'm known primarily
for my tomatoes.

209
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:42,806
I do a lot of canning.

210
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:45,809
But I'm also a firm believer
in the late-night snack.

211
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:47,640
Hey, how is it going?

212
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:48,895
Good.

213
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:51,944
This is Jim, and I'm Cindy.

214
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:55,732
Yeah, feel free to call us...

215
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,154
- Cindy and Jim.
- Cindy and Jim.

216
00:21:58,234 --> 00:21:59,406
Why would I?

217
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:02,913
That's no problem. You can...

218
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:05,328
- Call us Mr. and Mrs. Green.
- Mr. Green.

219
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:06,624
Not many people do, but...

220
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,873
Mom, really?

221
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:10,588
Dad.

222
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:21,974
Can I talk to you, Jim?

223
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,852
- He called me "Mom."
- Yes, he did.

224
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:31,650
- He called you "Dad."
- I know. I know.

225
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,236
Fifty-four girl names on the list,

226
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:36,063
and there was one boy, and it was...

227
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,739
Timothy.

228
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,279
Is he for us?

229
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:45,618
I'm getting that feeling.

230
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:18,151
-Be careful.
- Yeah.

231
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,372
Careful, careful.

232
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:40,715
There you go.

233
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:03,985
It was as if, all of a sudden,

234
00:24:04,068 --> 00:24:05,320
everything had changed.

235
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:06,779
There he was, leaves and all.

236
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,114
Didn't matter where he came from.

237
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:10,074
-He was ours.
-Yeah, we were his.

238
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:11,784
-And we were a family.
-We were a family.

239
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:16,000
Have we lost you? Are you still with us?

240
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:18,041
It's kind of crazy, right?

241
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,046
I've heard crazier.

242
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:22,294
- Really?
- No.

243
00:24:23,504 --> 00:24:26,508
That said, it's your time
to use as you choose.

244
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:28,843
I just have two words for you.

245
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:30,928
Tick tock.

246
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,143
-Oh, right.
-Oh.

247
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:34,394
Okay.

248
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:35,975
So...

249
00:24:53,117 --> 00:24:54,414
I think she forgot.

250
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:56,166
Ah, you're always early.

251
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:00,298
Hello!

252
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:03,339
Hi.

253
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:05,463
Hello there.

254
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:10,760
I'm Timothy.

255
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:11,893
Nice to meet you, Timothy.

256
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:13,061
Jim!

257
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:17,309
I got here last night.
I came from the garden.

258
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:19,731
Oh.

259
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:20,982
That's unusual.

260
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:22,779
Hi, sis! Okay, good.

261
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:24,232
Well, I'm glad you guys met. Jim?

262
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:25,361
Yeah!

263
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:26,784
I'm coming. Hey. Hi, Brenda.

264
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,364
Who was that?

265
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:30,371
- Oh!
- Are we early?

266
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:32,119
Oh, gosh.

267
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:33,949
I didn't think so.

268
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,247
Jim?

269
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:39,254
There we go.

270
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:41,881
- Jim!
- I'm on it!

271
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:44,839
Okay, kiddo,
you ready to meet some people?

272
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:47,888
- Mmm-hmm.
- Good, because we're not.

273
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,007
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good.

274
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,262
-Okay.
-Okay.

275
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,553
Now, all the kids
you're going to meet today,

276
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,396
they come from their moms' tummies.

277
00:25:57,139 --> 00:25:58,265
Whereas you come from...

278
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:00,066
- The garden.
- Yes!

279
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:02,986
I don't know about you,
but I have a tendency to over-share.

280
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:06,361
So maybe we just keep
some things between us for now.

281
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,159
Like the garden or your leaves.

282
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:10,828
Why?

283
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:16,162
Because they may not understand.

284
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:20,125
Can you understand
that they may not understand?

285
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:22,081
- I think so.
- Yes?

286
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:24,379
- Mmm-hmm.
- Good!

287
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,335
Let's go get ready to meet some people.

288
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:28,136
Okay.

289
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:30,472
Hold the corner down. Thank you.

290
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,887
Hey. Hey, everybody.

291
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,143
Here's what's happening.

292
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:39,102
It's no secret that
we've been trying to have a family

293
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,934
and we got some good news.

294
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:43,944
I know it's all of a sudden.

295
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:46,025
His name is Timothy.

296
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:50,534
And please don't ask
too many questions.

297
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:52,994
When were
you going to tell me,

298
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:55,619
and how old is he,
and where did he come from?

299
00:26:57,032 --> 00:27:00,502
It was all very sudden
and kind of miraculous.

300
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:01,920
Huh.

301
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,833
I mean, I thought
you were trying to have a real kid.

302
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:07,634
I mean, you know, one of your own.

303
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:11,927
He felt like mine
from the first time I saw him.

304
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:13,131
I'm sorry.

305
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:16,017
These are the coals.
I'm going to put that down for a second.

306
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:19,563
Well, with a little heads-up, I could've
helped with the clothes at least.

307
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:23,396
Hey, guys-

308
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:24,856
- Hey.
- Hi.

309
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:27,029
- How's it going?
- Yeah, good. You know.

310
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,321
- Is it going?
- Yeah.

311
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:29,899
How's everything going over there?

312
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:32,484
Who invited him?

313
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:37,581
I didn't think he would come.

314
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:39,912
Hi.

315
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:42,120
- Oh, hello.
- Hey, Timothy.

316
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:43,203
Hey.

317
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,046
This is my dad.

318
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:46,248
Hi, Grandpa.

319
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:48,425
Uh...

320
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:51,094
Call me Big Jim.

321
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,263
Okay, bye!

322
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:54,389
Okay.

323
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:55,932
Timothy, come here.

324
00:27:57,426 --> 00:27:58,552
Grandpa?

325
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:02,606
This is my Aunt Mel and my Uncle Bub.

326
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,600
They practically raised me.

327
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:07,361
- Hello, Timothy.
- Hi.

328
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:08,608
Hello, young man.

329
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:10,523
Hello, old boy.

330
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:13,408
Did you know I invented

331
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:16,157
the peanut butter and jelly sandwich?

332
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:18,539
Did you know I'm a big fan of your work?

333
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:22,242
Well, goodbye.

334
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,329
- Hi, I'm Timothy.
- Hi.

335
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,456
Hi. Hi.

336
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:29,458
Hi.

337
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,168
- Hi.
- Hey.

338
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:34,346
So you all came from
your mom's tummy?

339
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:38,141
How was that?

340
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:42,558
This all you got?

341
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:43,810
I know.

342
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:46,558
Who wants to play?

343
00:28:47,017 --> 00:28:50,146
The object, boys and girls,
is to dodge,

344
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:51,697
so how about we start with you?

345
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:52,773
Oh!

346
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:55,071
Out! You're out!

347
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,367
You got to move!

348
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,662
You got to dodge the ball, Timothy.

349
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:01,578
Come on!
Gotta move, gotta move, gotta move.

350
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:02,954
Into prison. You're out.

351
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:04,034
You have to coach him

352
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:05,994
because he clearly doesn't understand.

353
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:07,705
Timothy, Timothy. Timothy, Timothy.

354
00:29:07,788 --> 00:29:09,131
Look, it's just down to five kids.

355
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:11,129
Move your feet. Move around.
Keep an eye on the ball.

356
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:13,176
You're going down.

357
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:16,263
Stick and move,
stick and move! Come on!

358
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:17,339
Oh!

359
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,015
Get in there. Go. Help him out.

360
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,175
Oh!

361
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:23,053
Ahh!

362
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:25,101
Let's just call this...

363
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,898
I don't think this is a good idea.

364
00:29:26,974 --> 00:29:28,191
You're not going
to spoil all the fun, are you?

365
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:30,611
- No, but... Could you just...
- Go, go, go, go.

366
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:33,314
Okay. Hey. Here we go,
here we go, here we go!

367
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:34,819
You got to dodge the ball.
Move your feet.

368
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:37,614
Take it easy, Big Jim.
This is not the Olympics.

369
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:38,694
The thing about these kids is

370
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,029
you never know what you're getting.

371
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:43,036
They have issues sometimes. Medical or

372
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:44,666
otherwise.

373
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,209
And if he has any issues,
we'll deal with them.

374
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,912
- Like any normal kid.
- Okay.

375
00:29:58,213 --> 00:29:59,590
I mean, that's not normal.

376
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:53,352
Hey!

377
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:54,436
Oh, my...

378
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,771
Hey. What did you do that for?

379
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:58,152
Out! You are... Uh-oh!

380
00:30:58,231 --> 00:31:00,529
- Come on. It's dodgeball.
- Big Jim, honestly.

381
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:02,737
I can't believe
I'm about to say this,

382
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:05,572
but what did you say to your father

383
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:08,204
after he bonked the boy
with leaves in the head?

384
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,503
Hmm. It's complicated.

385
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:13,205
- I didn't say anything.
- Mmm-hmm.

386
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,706
Really?

387
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:15,757
But I made a vow

388
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:17,709
that I would do things
differently than my dad.

389
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:18,885
I would be much better...

390
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,964
Jim decided that
he would be the father he never had.

391
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:25,725
What about you?

392
00:31:26,093 --> 00:31:27,265
I decided that

393
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:30,563
our son would not be
seen as different or weird.

394
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,479
He'd be treated like a normal kid.

395
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:34,605
Yeah.

396
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:36,027
Because that's what he was going to be.

397
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:39,197
Just a... A normal kid.

398
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,817
Incredible.

399
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,829
Good color, strong veins.

400
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,249
Yeah. They're beautiful, aren't they?

401
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:50,667
Most unusual.

402
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:54,670
Can you cut them off?

403
00:31:55,372 --> 00:31:57,591
But they're perfectly healthy.
Why would you...

404
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:00,336
Oh, right.

405
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:05,341
Timothy, Reggie and I go way back.

406
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,260
He's amazing with plants,

407
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:10,892
and if there's anyone
who can do this, he's the guy.

408
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:14,437
You know, when I was your age,

409
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:15,859
I had a wart on my thumb.

410
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:18,437
The other kids,
they used to call me "The Warthog."

411
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,897
Kids can be so cruel.

412
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:23,199
You know, my dad,
he had a doctor burn that puppy off,

413
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:26,820
and after that,
nobody made fun of me at all.

414
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:29,076
We don't want anyone
to make fun of you.

415
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,617
That's what this is about.
What do you think?

416
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:34,836
Okay. Go for it.

417
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:37,880
Okay.

418
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:44,967
Okay. You may feel a slight pinch.

419
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:46,674
Okay. Take a deep breath.

420
00:32:48,258 --> 00:32:49,430
We're here, pal.

421
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:02,402
This isn't going to work, is it?

422
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,278
No.

423
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:07,827
You take them
to the doctor, right?

424
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:10,163
You give them medicine
that doesn't taste good,

425
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,740
they get shots that hurt.

426
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:13,746
That's the job.

427
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:16,002
We thought we were doing our job.

428
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:21,792
What did you put in there?
He's about to fall over.

429
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:23,843
Anything he might need.
Notebooks, pencils.

430
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,217
There's a box of tissues
on the bottom and some Band-Aids.

431
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:28,719
There's a whole first aid kit
actually, just in case...

432
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:30,596
Variety of healthy snacks,

433
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,473
treats and Graham Crackers.
I know you like them.

434
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:34,930
And then a flashlight
and some batteries.

435
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,936
Mom, I think I can handle it from here.

436
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,692
Oh, there's an extra pair of socks!

437
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:43,609
- Have a great day!
- Okay, bye!

438
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:44,860
That's too much pressure.

439
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,487
Have the day you have.

440
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:56,493
This morning you were late for work,

441
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:57,998
there's a jelly stain on your sweater.

442
00:33:58,078 --> 00:34:00,547
And frankly you seem
inappropriately cheerful.

443
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:01,919
I know, but there is good reason.

444
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:03,420
We've had a young boy come to stay...

445
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,877
ls there something about my expression

446
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,837
that suggests I'm
the least bit interested?

447
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,467
No, ma'am, nothing
about your expression is...

448
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:10,470
And you continue to talk because...

449
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,637
I'm sorry.

450
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:22,985
Hello?

451
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:27,153
Best-case scenario, reduced hours.

452
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:30,026
Limited layoffs. Limited.

453
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:33,075
Like you lose your job
and you lose your job.

454
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:35,327
Not you specifically, but some of you.

455
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:38,038
Worst-case scenario,

456
00:34:38,118 --> 00:34:41,088
my aunt and my father will have
no choice but to close the factory.

457
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:43,669
I know.

458
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,421
I don't want that to happen.

459
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,592
Hello?

460
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,053
And I'm not saying that that's...

461
00:34:48,128 --> 00:34:49,596
I'm sorry, Green?

462
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:50,885
Are we disturbing you?

463
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:53,174
Hi, honey.

464
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:54,760
Jim, the school called.

465
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:56,641
- What's the matter?
- How fast can you get here?

466
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,732
Thank you so much
for coming so quickly.

467
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:03,435
We take these matters very seriously.

468
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:05,361
- Thank you.
- Come. Come. He's here.

469
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:06,771
Timothy!

470
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:09,357
No!

471
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:11,322
Hey, who did this to you?

472
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,487
He won't give us the names of the kids.

473
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:18,162
What happened?

474
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:20,160
Art project.

475
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:23,375
Art project?

476
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,084
Let's get this art project cleaned up.

477
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,585
Just let me.

478
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:08,375
- Jim...
- Timothy.

479
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:12,136
This kind of thing happened to me
when I was your age.

480
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:13,425
Yeah.

481
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:15,507
And all I wanted
was for my dad to have my back,

482
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,841
and he didn't.

483
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:19,428
So here's what we're going to do.

484
00:36:20,637 --> 00:36:21,638
You're going to tell me the names

485
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:23,189
of the boys that did this to you.

486
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:24,770
Okay?

487
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:27,268
And I will handle it.

488
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:46,962
Hey, boss.

489
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:49,715
Green.

490
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:52,715
I guess
you heard what happened.

491
00:36:52,794 --> 00:36:53,966
Yeah, they called me home.

492
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,259
Yeah, me, too.

493
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:56,806
What's going on?

494
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,263
Your father's handling this.

495
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,477
I didn't really mind.

496
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:02,979
Your kid ratted my boys out.

497
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,940
He didn't rat them out.
That was my fault.

498
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:07,559
So you ratted my boys out.

499
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:10,612
You can't let people
treat you like this. Come on.

500
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:13,782
How long you been
at this parenting thing?

501
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:16,743
Are you really going to
fight all his battles for him?

502
00:37:16,818 --> 00:37:18,741
You think that's wise?

503
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:20,326
Hi!

504
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:23,329
It was really important to Jim
that the Crudstaff boys

505
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:25,410
take responsibility for
what they did to Timothy.

506
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,495
- Yeah.
- And did they?

507
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:29,918
We were having fun.

508
00:37:30,457 --> 00:37:32,835
He didn't fight back.
He didn't even cry.

509
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:34,506
It wasn't any fun.

510
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:35,883
I think what the boys

511
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:37,805
are trying to say is next Saturday

512
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:39,849
we're having a birthday party pool bash,

513
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,018
and we'd love it if Timothy would come.

514
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:43,686
Yes!

515
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,813
Oh, please. Don't tell me

516
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:49,438
you took him back
to the house of the boys who bullied him.

517
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:52,733
He really, really wanted to go.

518
00:37:53,146 --> 00:37:55,069
So you let him decide what was best.

519
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:59,365
I thought it was time
he learned to fight his own battles.

520
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:01,412
We just forgot to ask if he could swim.

521
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:10,539
Nice socks, Green!

522
00:39:26,823 --> 00:39:30,703
# Happy birthday to you

523
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:36,003
# Happy birthday to you

524
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:41,922
# Happy birthday dear Bobby

525
00:39:42,672 --> 00:39:48,725
# Happy birthday to you

526
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:39,896
So was it fun?

527
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:41,276
- How did it go?
- Were they nice?

528
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:42,573
Were you the man?

529
00:40:42,649 --> 00:40:44,447
I kicked a girl in the head.

530
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:45,864
- What?
- Why'?

531
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:47,946
Well, she tried to pull down my socks.

532
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:50,282
What? Did she see you?

533
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:51,491
I don't think so.

534
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,543
Maybe.

535
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:56,003
I'm sure she didn't see him.

536
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:59,299
You cannot let anybody
see your leaves, honey.

537
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:01,126
I know, but

538
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:04,088
what do I do about the girl
I kicked in the head?

539
00:41:04,754 --> 00:41:05,755
Jim?

540
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:09,809
Well, if you see her coming,
just run the other way.

541
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:12,811
- Okay.
- Yeah. Yeah.

542
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:32,907
You know I saw.

543
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:35,039
Look.

544
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:36,790
Look.

545
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:37,870
No.

546
00:41:37,954 --> 00:41:39,046
Just look.

547
00:41:39,122 --> 00:41:40,214
Why?

548
00:41:40,957 --> 00:41:42,004
You'll see.

549
00:41:46,087 --> 00:41:47,179
Wow.

550
00:41:47,964 --> 00:41:49,807
You're not the only one with a secret.

551
00:41:58,141 --> 00:41:59,643
You coming?

552
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:01,273
Okay.

553
00:42:16,284 --> 00:42:17,831
It's perfect.

554
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:21,247
Whoo!

555
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:22,961
Look at that nest!

556
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:26,215
I get inspired from this street, you know,

557
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:27,887
for my sculptures and my art.

558
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:29,096
Yeah.

559
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:31,174
I always get inspired by nature.

560
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:41,438
I almost forgot.

561
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:44,691
Compliments of the Crudstaffs.

562
00:42:44,771 --> 00:42:46,899
And, please, tell your friends.

563
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:49,109
Thanks.

564
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:02,121
We're all working hard.

565
00:43:02,205 --> 00:43:04,173
I know. It's going to be fine.

566
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:06,000
- Jim.
- Hey, honey.

567
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:07,256
It's not really a good time.

568
00:43:07,335 --> 00:43:09,053
Look out your window.

569
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:13,933
Remember when he said
he kicked a girl in the head?

570
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:15,635
<i>- Yeah.
- Is that her?</i>

571
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:17,937
Because this is too soon.
He's too young.

572
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:19,889
You told him to run the other way when he saw her and...

573
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:22,851
he's not running...

574
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:51,754
Whoa!

575
00:43:57,218 --> 00:43:58,390
See you.

576
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:00,767
Yeah. See you.

577
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:09,359
Yes! Yes! Yes!

578
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:41,311
Timothy?

579
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:43,230
Timothy!

580
00:44:44,182 --> 00:44:46,810
That night,
our plan was to sit Timothy down,

581
00:44:46,893 --> 00:44:49,021
just as parents. Go right at it.

582
00:44:49,437 --> 00:44:50,529
Right at what?

583
00:44:50,605 --> 00:44:52,482
Well, we were going to have...

584
00:44:52,565 --> 00:44:53,566
"The talk"

585
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:55,948
...that you have that we

586
00:44:56,027 --> 00:44:57,404
didn't really know how to have.

587
00:44:57,486 --> 00:44:59,830
That was the plan.
The talk, that night.

588
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:02,283
-Hey, buddy.
-But then...

589
00:45:05,286 --> 00:45:06,754
What is it?

590
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:09,290
Sweetie, it's your Uncle Bub.

591
00:45:11,918 --> 00:45:13,591
We got to go. Come on.

592
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:25,685
- Are we too late?
- No, no.

593
00:45:25,765 --> 00:45:27,642
Bubbles is still with us.

594
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:31,399
I brought your favorite cookies.

595
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:33,823
If I can get them past the police,
I'll leave you one.

596
00:45:33,898 --> 00:45:35,491
At least it's not ice cream.

597
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:39,825
Remember the year
that you started to lose your hair

598
00:45:39,904 --> 00:45:42,407
and you convinced Brenda and me

599
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:44,993
that if we gave you ice cream at night,
it would grow back?

600
00:45:48,955 --> 00:45:51,504
Cinderella, do you remember
that painting you made?

601
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:53,918
No. What painting?

602
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:57,596
You know, when your mom was your age

603
00:45:57,672 --> 00:45:59,015
she was quite an artiste.

604
00:45:59,507 --> 00:46:01,134
Not really. I was not.

605
00:46:01,217 --> 00:46:02,935
Oh, she was never happier

606
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,853
than when she had
a paintbrush in her hand.

607
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:06,351
That's right.

608
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:10,435
She worked on this
one painting for days.

609
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:13,488
Wouldn't let anybody see it.
Had to get it right.

610
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:15,360
You remember that?

611
00:46:15,982 --> 00:46:17,029
No.

612
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:19,611
It was a self-portrait.

613
00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:25,500
We didn't get it.
It was ahead of its time.

614
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:28,043
We all laughed.

615
00:46:29,245 --> 00:46:30,963
Boy, did you cry.

616
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:33,048
You ran away,

617
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:36,799
and when you came back,
the picture was gone.

618
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:39,130
You'd thrown it away.

619
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:40,214
Oh!

620
00:46:40,298 --> 00:46:42,221
I always felt so bad about that.

621
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,392
No!

622
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:44,468
Oh, Bub!

623
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,138
We're going to
take a little break.

624
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:49,349
Bubbles, you're going to
have a little rest.

625
00:46:51,267 --> 00:46:53,235
Let Timothy stay, huh?

626
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:55,696
Okay. You okay?

627
00:46:56,314 --> 00:46:57,566
It's okay, Mom.

628
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:58,695
Okay.

629
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:00,576
We're right here.

630
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:05,656
Hey.

631
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:09,168
Something you want to ask me?

632
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:13,214
Is it true you also invented the BLT?

633
00:47:17,418 --> 00:47:20,012
I mean, I would have
brought my kids if I'd known.

634
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:22,389
- Shouldn't he be resting?
- Maybe you should get him.

635
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:24,892
- I'm on it.
- No, let them be.

636
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:50,952
I never thought I'd hear that laugh again.

637
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,132
Next.

638
00:49:21,584 --> 00:49:25,384
After that, we needed to
get Timothy back to just...

639
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:27,222
- Hi.
-...being a kid.

640
00:49:29,717 --> 00:49:31,594
Coach Cal doesn't see it.

641
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,057
Next.

642
00:49:34,555 --> 00:49:36,557
Help us out here, Coach.

643
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:38,355
This would be really good for him.

644
00:49:38,434 --> 00:49:40,687
This is the best possible way for him
to make some friends.

645
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:50,079
Go! Go! Go! Go!

646
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:51,497
Come on, Green. Let's see what you got.

647
00:49:51,572 --> 00:49:53,040
That's right.
Let's see what you got!

648
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:54,332
Eye on the ball.

649
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,298
Oh, my gosh!

650
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:04,339
Take the smiles off your faces.

651
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:05,715
Is your ankle all right?

652
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:07,467
He's good.

653
00:50:08,172 --> 00:50:09,264
Come on, Green!

654
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:13,014
Eyes on the ball!

655
00:50:20,226 --> 00:50:21,728
Oh, dear God.

656
00:50:24,522 --> 00:50:25,694
Why are you smiling?

657
00:50:26,232 --> 00:50:27,449
I can only get better.

658
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:32,864
Erasers, run it out!
Come on. Hustle up!

659
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:34,531
- Green.
- Nice job.

660
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:36,454
Run, run, run!

661
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:39,287
Don't cut any corners.

662
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:41,171
Excuse me, Coach, I just want to say

663
00:50:41,247 --> 00:50:42,419
that I'll be working with him

664
00:50:42,498 --> 00:50:43,795
around the clock if necessary

665
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:45,126
just to get him to the next level.

666
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:47,553
Oh, tell me you're not
those kind of parents.

667
00:50:47,628 --> 00:50:49,722
The type that get
over-involved, over-invested.

668
00:50:49,797 --> 00:50:51,845
We are definitely
not those kind of parents.

669
00:50:51,924 --> 00:50:54,143
Then we won't have a problem.

670
00:50:54,218 --> 00:50:56,312
- Jim.
- Come on! Run it out!

671
00:50:56,637 --> 00:50:59,356
Come on, Timothy.
Come on, run faster. Yes, yes, yes!

672
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:00,523
Run it out, Erasers!

673
00:51:01,267 --> 00:51:02,234
What is she doing here?

674
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:03,310
I don't know.

675
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:05,362
There are so many girls.

676
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:07,235
Yeah, okay.

677
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:09,112
Which means it's possible
to find the right girl.

678
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:10,659
Use your feet. Your feet.

679
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:12,828
What your dad wants to say but isn't

680
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:17,875
is that it would be a mistake
to focus on just one fish

681
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:20,411
-when there are so many...
- Fish?

682
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:21,666
Keep your eyes on the ball.

683
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:23,463
Use the inside of your foot. All right?

684
00:51:23,539 --> 00:51:24,961
Jim! Could you...

685
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:29,006
What your mom is trying to say...

686
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:30,087
Right.

687
00:51:32,131 --> 00:51:33,178
Well...

688
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,222
-Uh!
- Okay

689
00:51:36,844 --> 00:51:37,845
Come on.

690
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:41,686
Listen. I know the feeling.

691
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:42,937
You do?

692
00:51:43,017 --> 00:51:45,190
When I was about your age, I met a girl.

693
00:51:45,269 --> 00:51:47,271
She was an original.

694
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:49,356
Creative, artsy type.

695
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,694
So... I know the pull.

696
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:55,620
Jim? Where you going with this?

697
00:51:55,696 --> 00:51:57,243
What happened with the girl?

698
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:01,911
I married her. Right.

699
00:52:01,994 --> 00:52:03,337
Not what I had in mind, but...

700
00:52:03,412 --> 00:52:04,413
It's true.

701
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:06,590
Okay! Keep your eye on the ball,

702
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:08,963
inside of the foot, stay on your feet! Go!

703
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:12,421
- Wow!
- Oh! Perfect!

704
00:52:12,504 --> 00:52:14,802
- Perfect, perfect, perfect!
- Look at that!

705
00:52:14,882 --> 00:52:16,634
It's not that
we wanted him to be perfect.

706
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:17,764
That's what we're looking for!

707
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:20,016
- We wanted it to be perfect.
- Let's go again.

708
00:52:20,763 --> 00:52:22,390
His childhood.

709
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:26,356
And just when we started to
get the hang of it at home...

710
00:52:26,435 --> 00:52:28,938
Things got
complicated at the factory.

711
00:52:29,021 --> 00:52:30,568
Looking good, Brian.

712
00:52:31,065 --> 00:52:33,534
Boss wants to see you. In his office.

713
00:52:33,609 --> 00:52:34,906
- Now?
- Now.

714
00:52:38,781 --> 00:52:40,499
You want to see me?

715
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:41,575
Sit.

716
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:47,043
Heard your kid joined the Erasers.

717
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:49,508
Yes. Yes, he did.

718
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:51,836
Is he good? Hope he's good.

719
00:52:51,919 --> 00:52:53,136
Well...

720
00:52:56,757 --> 00:53:00,728
That's a confidential list.
First round of layoffs.

721
00:53:00,803 --> 00:53:01,850
Of course, my aunt and my father

722
00:53:01,929 --> 00:53:04,432
might decide that that's not enough.

723
00:53:07,101 --> 00:53:10,776
But these are all good,
hard-working people.

724
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:13,232
Green, you don't decide who we let go.

725
00:53:14,942 --> 00:53:16,944
You'll just be the one to tell them.

726
00:53:26,412 --> 00:53:27,664
Night, guys.

727
00:53:30,374 --> 00:53:32,376
Oh, why couldn't
the skeleton cross the road?

728
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:37,301
Why, sweetie?

729
00:53:37,381 --> 00:53:38,849
Because it had no guts.

730
00:53:41,844 --> 00:53:43,562
Ooh! I got another one.

731
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:44,638
Buddy.

732
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:46,474
Not tonight.

733
00:53:48,976 --> 00:53:50,603
If you will excuse me.

734
00:54:05,534 --> 00:54:06,535
Dad?

735
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:13,421
That Halloween,
your mom went as a pencil.

736
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,093
- A blue pencil.
- Mmm-hmm.

737
00:54:15,836 --> 00:54:16,837
Hmm.

738
00:54:17,421 --> 00:54:19,139
- It was a good costume.
- It was.

739
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:20,841
My head was the eraser.

740
00:54:23,177 --> 00:54:24,679
I had seen a lot of pencils,

741
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:27,439
but I had never seen
one quite like your mom.

742
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:28,515
Breathtaking.

743
00:54:29,183 --> 00:54:31,857
But I was too scared to even talk to her,

744
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:34,188
so I wrote her a note.

745
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:35,985
Yeah.

746
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:38,658
- What did it say?
- It said...

747
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:43,163
"it feels to me that with a pencil

748
00:54:44,448 --> 00:54:45,870
"anything is possible."

749
00:54:46,867 --> 00:54:48,585
That is so true.

750
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:52,130
Hey. Pass me that book. Yeah.

751
00:54:53,499 --> 00:54:54,546
All of these...

752
00:54:56,043 --> 00:54:58,592
All of these notebooks from that day,

753
00:55:00,214 --> 00:55:02,558
I just filled them with ideas

754
00:55:03,926 --> 00:55:05,928
of things that I wanted to make.

755
00:55:06,887 --> 00:55:11,518
Because I thought
to be a part of making something,

756
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,602
that was a great feeling.

757
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:20,363
God, to think that
we may not be making these anymore.

758
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:24,580
Why not make a new kind of pencil?

759
00:55:28,367 --> 00:55:30,586
- That's easier said than done.
- Yeah.

760
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:34,255
Well, you can design it

761
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:37,547
and you can draw it.

762
00:55:38,085 --> 00:55:39,928
Then you guys can both build it.

763
00:55:41,088 --> 00:55:42,806
I want to write a note to Joni.

764
00:55:44,091 --> 00:55:45,388
Good night.

765
00:55:48,846 --> 00:55:50,894
How do you tell your child
something's not possible?

766
00:55:51,171 --> 00:55:52,423
That it can't be done.

767
00:55:52,505 --> 00:55:54,758
When they believe in you like that.

768
00:55:54,841 --> 00:55:55,967
We didn't want to disappoint him.

769
00:55:56,051 --> 00:55:57,268
No. We got busy.

770
00:55:57,343 --> 00:55:59,186
Not that we thought
that we could do it.

771
00:55:59,262 --> 00:56:00,809
At least Timothy
would know that we tried.

772
00:56:00,889 --> 00:56:02,106
Yeah. We stayed up
all that first night.

773
00:56:02,182 --> 00:56:04,230
We stayed up
several nights after that.

774
00:56:04,309 --> 00:56:05,435
Cindy started making sketches.

775
00:56:05,518 --> 00:56:06,770
<i>Jim started carving</i>

776
00:56:07,479 --> 00:56:10,653
It turns out we weren't
the only ones making something.

777
00:56:11,608 --> 00:56:14,828
Yeah. We both came up
with the idea to use leaves.

778
00:56:14,903 --> 00:56:15,904
Leaves.

779
00:56:19,157 --> 00:56:22,252
See? Now just wind it.
The other way. Yeah. You got it.

780
00:56:26,289 --> 00:56:28,007
Just a little more.

781
00:56:28,249 --> 00:56:30,217
Yeah, see?
Just put it right through.

782
00:56:30,293 --> 00:56:32,170
- Like this?
- That's good.

783
00:56:34,089 --> 00:56:35,966
So we've got
our leaf slurry pretty much ready.

784
00:56:36,091 --> 00:56:38,310
Okay. Right on in.

785
00:56:40,345 --> 00:56:41,847
- Perfect.
- That should do it.

786
00:56:42,097 --> 00:56:44,850
Let's see. Help it...
Help it push it down.

787
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:47,273
Okay.

788
00:56:47,352 --> 00:56:48,774
Oh, yeah!

789
00:56:52,649 --> 00:56:53,696
Okay.

790
00:56:54,442 --> 00:56:56,319
Ta-da!

791
00:56:56,402 --> 00:56:59,656
Oh, my gosh!
This is the pencil. You really did it.

792
00:56:59,739 --> 00:57:01,116
- We did.
- You made it.

793
00:57:01,199 --> 00:57:04,624
So we're to believe
that you made a pencil out of leaves?

794
00:57:05,036 --> 00:57:07,164
- Mmm-hmm.
- Well, it was a prototype.

795
00:57:07,247 --> 00:57:10,171
You do realize if any part of
your story doesn't check out,

796
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:11,672
we are done here.

797
00:57:11,751 --> 00:57:14,300
And we will be
checking it out. Thoroughly.

798
00:57:14,379 --> 00:57:15,505
- And you should.
- Well, good.

799
00:57:15,588 --> 00:57:19,809
Anyway, that Monday
was take your kid to work day.

800
00:57:20,552 --> 00:57:21,553
He started with me.

801
00:57:22,345 --> 00:57:25,098
It was kind of
a celebratory day at work and...

802
00:57:27,809 --> 00:57:29,356
Timothy wanted to be in on it.

803
00:57:29,435 --> 00:57:30,903
Something's missing.

804
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:33,523
Oh, nonsense. It's you. So...

805
00:57:34,065 --> 00:57:35,237
Very you.

806
00:57:35,567 --> 00:57:36,864
Gentlemen.

807
00:57:38,945 --> 00:57:41,039
And as soon
as he met my boss,

808
00:57:41,156 --> 00:57:43,124
he didn't know to be intimidated by her,

809
00:57:43,199 --> 00:57:44,746
and the next thing you know...

810
00:57:44,868 --> 00:57:46,870
Little man, what do you think of that?

811
00:57:47,495 --> 00:57:48,747
Not much.

812
00:57:48,830 --> 00:57:50,628
Well, that's honest.

813
00:57:50,707 --> 00:57:51,754
Timothy's very honest, ma'am.

814
00:57:51,833 --> 00:57:56,009
That was done by a renowned artist
at great expense.

815
00:57:56,087 --> 00:57:57,760
I would have done it for free.

816
00:57:59,090 --> 00:58:01,263
Are you suggesting
you could do it better?

817
00:58:01,968 --> 00:58:03,140
I can try.

818
00:58:04,512 --> 00:58:06,514
Well, let's find out.

819
00:58:08,057 --> 00:58:10,901
May I just remind you,
ma'am, as his parent,

820
00:58:10,977 --> 00:58:12,024
that he is only ten years old, and...

821
00:58:12,103 --> 00:58:13,446
Don't you have somewhere to be?

822
00:58:13,521 --> 00:58:14,818
Of course I do, but...

823
00:58:15,773 --> 00:58:16,945
- Shoo.
- Okay.

824
00:59:31,683 --> 00:59:32,684
Oh!

825
00:59:35,061 --> 00:59:36,859
Oh, sweetie.

826
00:59:37,772 --> 00:59:40,616
Oh, it's beautiful. It's amazing.

827
00:59:40,733 --> 00:59:42,030
It's amazing.

828
00:59:44,028 --> 00:59:46,076
Oh, no, no, no.
Erase that.

829
00:59:46,322 --> 00:59:47,665
Why?

830
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:53,831
It turns out, Timothy
was Picasso with a pencil.

831
00:59:53,913 --> 00:59:56,211
So he had
all the qualities you imagined?

832
00:59:56,374 --> 00:59:57,375
Oh, yes.

833
00:59:57,625 --> 01:00:00,754
Yeah, well,
including honest to a fault.

834
01:00:13,057 --> 01:00:15,310
He couldn't help
but draw her exactly as he saw her.

835
01:00:15,393 --> 01:00:16,485
Yeah.

836
01:00:16,978 --> 01:00:19,822
It included an unfortunate
thatch of chin hair.

837
01:00:19,897 --> 01:00:20,898
Mmm.

838
01:00:27,155 --> 01:00:30,625
So, what else aren't you telling me?

839
01:00:32,869 --> 01:00:33,916
Tell her.

840
01:00:34,329 --> 01:00:35,706
Hmm?

841
01:00:35,913 --> 01:00:37,039
I'm waiting.

842
01:00:37,707 --> 01:00:40,005
Sometimes you wear
plaids and stripes that clash.

843
01:00:40,752 --> 01:00:42,095
Hmm.

844
01:00:42,295 --> 01:00:45,048
Your one joke that
you always tell, it's not funny.

845
01:00:46,341 --> 01:00:48,844
No one can appreciate the art in here

846
01:00:48,926 --> 01:00:50,644
because everything
that is special and beautiful,

847
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:52,222
no one can see
because the curtains are so thick

848
01:00:52,305 --> 01:00:54,307
that the light can't get in.

849
01:00:54,390 --> 01:00:56,813
Not to mention, if someone has a child

850
01:00:56,893 --> 01:00:59,863
who just is born or appears,

851
01:01:00,229 --> 01:01:02,277
say congratulations with a smile.

852
01:01:02,398 --> 01:01:04,275
Say something nice.

853
01:01:04,942 --> 01:01:06,194
I wanted to love you,

854
01:01:06,277 --> 01:01:07,870
and I have tried so hard to like you.

855
01:01:07,945 --> 01:01:10,789
But if someone asked me to be
a pallbearer at your funeral,

856
01:01:10,865 --> 01:01:14,290
I would tell them not by
the hair of my chinny-chin-chin.

857
01:01:14,827 --> 01:01:15,953
And furthermore...

858
01:01:16,037 --> 01:01:18,085
- Cindy lost her job.
- I lost my job.

859
01:01:20,958 --> 01:01:23,802
I didn't regret most of what I said.

860
01:01:24,879 --> 01:01:26,176
But you lost your job.

861
01:01:28,174 --> 01:01:29,721
Make sure all the pencils are good.

862
01:01:29,801 --> 01:01:31,678
So things were going to get harder.

863
01:01:31,761 --> 01:01:33,479
But at least I still had my job.

864
01:01:33,721 --> 01:01:34,938
Yes, he did.

865
01:01:35,431 --> 01:01:38,150
They go in this box.
They go on a little pencil vacation.

866
01:01:38,226 --> 01:01:39,273
And what did you say about

867
01:01:39,352 --> 01:01:41,070
having Timothy with you that day?

868
01:01:41,145 --> 01:01:42,988
- Oh, right.
- That's a lot of trees.

869
01:01:43,731 --> 01:01:45,028
I couldn't help but feel...

870
01:01:45,108 --> 01:01:46,155
Mind if I have one?

871
01:01:46,317 --> 01:01:47,443
...anything was possible.

872
01:01:47,777 --> 01:01:49,154
You want another one?
You want a yellow one?

873
01:01:49,237 --> 01:01:51,114
We got this... You see, we got a whole...

874
01:01:51,197 --> 01:01:53,120
- Right back.
- Good luck, Dad.

875
01:01:53,491 --> 01:01:55,789
So Jim gave it his best shot.

876
01:01:55,910 --> 01:01:57,787
Sir? How you doing?

877
01:01:59,414 --> 01:02:00,791
- Huh?
- Do you have a minute?

878
01:02:01,165 --> 01:02:02,166
No.

879
01:02:04,001 --> 01:02:07,175
Oh, hell. Why not?
Turns out we may all get the axe.

880
01:02:08,339 --> 01:02:09,340
What?

881
01:02:09,424 --> 01:02:11,347
Then I think we got nothing to lose.

882
01:02:11,426 --> 01:02:14,270
What if we made a new kind of pencil?

883
01:02:46,419 --> 01:02:49,298
Come on, Erasers!
Come on! Come on!

884
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:51,974
Push up the field! Push up the field!

885
01:02:52,049 --> 01:02:55,428
Don't pass it!
How do you score if you pass it!

886
01:02:56,220 --> 01:02:58,564
Kick it! Kick the ball!

887
01:02:59,557 --> 01:03:00,979
- Mom! I'm so thirsty.
- What are you doing?

888
01:03:01,142 --> 01:03:03,520
No, no, no. Get back on D. Back on D!

889
01:03:06,939 --> 01:03:08,031
Come on!

890
01:03:09,442 --> 01:03:12,946
I saw your car.
Didn't know the kid was a player.

891
01:03:13,029 --> 01:03:14,326
What position? Striker?

892
01:03:14,405 --> 01:03:15,452
Uh...

893
01:03:15,531 --> 01:03:18,375
Well, he's taking a break right now.

894
01:03:18,451 --> 01:03:20,920
Oh, well, I got time.

895
01:03:21,913 --> 01:03:23,165
It might be a while.

896
01:03:25,166 --> 01:03:26,884
You know, I'm impressed, Dad.

897
01:03:27,502 --> 01:03:29,095
You never really came to my games.

898
01:03:29,253 --> 01:03:33,099
No. I came.
You were always on the bench.

899
01:03:33,925 --> 01:03:37,395
Come on, Luke.
Find your man. Find your man!

900
01:03:37,595 --> 01:03:38,938
You got to want it!

901
01:03:39,013 --> 01:03:40,139
Oh, here we go.

902
01:03:40,264 --> 01:03:42,016
Come on, I want to see some fight!

903
01:03:42,141 --> 01:03:43,518
To keep you hydrated, sir.

904
01:03:44,977 --> 01:03:46,069
Thank you.

905
01:03:48,356 --> 01:03:49,824
He's a water boy.

906
01:03:51,025 --> 01:03:52,151
No. Dad,

907
01:03:52,235 --> 01:03:55,239
actually, I'm working
on all aspects of his game right now.

908
01:03:57,114 --> 01:03:58,286
And you know what...

909
01:03:58,449 --> 01:04:01,077
Come on, Erasers.
Keep your head in the game.

910
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:02,286
Let's go, Bobby! Let's go!

911
01:04:02,370 --> 01:04:03,872
Good pass. Good pass.

912
01:04:07,291 --> 01:04:09,214
- All right.
- Yeah. Yeah.

913
01:04:09,961 --> 01:04:11,304
Good eye! Good eye!

914
01:04:11,379 --> 01:04:12,631
Talk to each other!

915
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:15,383
Erasers, talk to each other!

916
01:04:15,466 --> 01:04:17,889
That's your house, Philip!

917
01:04:17,969 --> 01:04:19,596
Don't let nothing in there!
That's your house!

918
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:20,596
That's your house!

919
01:04:27,436 --> 01:04:29,484
All this time, it felt like

920
01:04:29,564 --> 01:04:32,158
there was something
Timothy wasn't telling us.

921
01:04:41,284 --> 01:04:44,083
And he was spending
far too much time with that girl.

922
01:04:44,161 --> 01:04:45,913
Was it a problem for you?

923
01:04:47,665 --> 01:04:49,383
Well,
they were up to something,

924
01:04:49,458 --> 01:04:50,425
and we didn't know what.

925
01:04:52,295 --> 01:04:54,263
Can you teach me to do that thing?

926
01:04:54,338 --> 01:04:55,931
You know, that you do with your arms

927
01:04:56,007 --> 01:04:57,600
and you put your head up in the sun.

928
01:04:57,675 --> 01:04:59,018
Well, first, find the light, all right?

929
01:04:59,093 --> 01:05:00,094
Okay.

930
01:05:00,177 --> 01:05:04,933
Just absorb it.
Just soak it in. Think "tree."

931
01:05:06,434 --> 01:05:08,232
- Do you feel it?
- Yeah, I feel it.

932
01:05:09,353 --> 01:05:10,445
Nice.

933
01:05:11,981 --> 01:05:13,574
Maybe you should show your birthmark,

934
01:05:13,649 --> 01:05:15,242
because people might like it.

935
01:05:15,318 --> 01:05:16,319
I don't know.

936
01:05:16,402 --> 01:05:19,201
We didn't know
what he was doing with the girl.

937
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:20,873
It was fine if he wanted to have a secret

938
01:05:20,948 --> 01:05:23,042
as long as he shared it with us.

939
01:05:25,328 --> 01:05:27,501
So Cindy did
what she thought was best.

940
01:05:36,881 --> 01:05:37,882
Hey!

941
01:05:38,633 --> 01:05:39,930
Hey!

942
01:05:43,971 --> 01:05:45,063
We need to talk.

943
01:05:45,139 --> 01:05:46,436
Okay, let's talk.

944
01:05:47,558 --> 01:05:48,684
Well, can you wait?

945
01:05:50,227 --> 01:05:51,353
Fine.

946
01:05:54,565 --> 01:05:58,741
I don't think that
you're the best influence on my son,

947
01:05:58,986 --> 01:06:00,988
And I want you to tell me what you know about him

948
01:06:01,072 --> 01:06:02,244
I know a lot.

949
01:06:02,323 --> 01:06:03,449
I thought so.

950
01:06:04,241 --> 01:06:05,663
So you know that he's got...

951
01:06:07,662 --> 01:06:09,209
You know that he's different.

952
01:06:09,330 --> 01:06:11,674
Yeah. It's what I like about him.

953
01:06:13,459 --> 01:06:15,257
Well, it's a hard world
to be different in.

954
01:06:16,379 --> 01:06:17,756
And I don't want him to be hurt.

955
01:06:18,214 --> 01:06:20,216
By you or anyone.
I won't let it happen.

956
01:06:20,341 --> 01:06:21,433
That's good.

957
01:06:23,678 --> 01:06:25,146
What is this?

958
01:06:26,389 --> 01:06:28,266
He's going to be misunderstood.

959
01:06:29,725 --> 01:06:31,727
Lots of people hate anything different.

960
01:06:33,646 --> 01:06:35,319
I wish it wasn't this way, but

961
01:06:36,148 --> 01:06:38,571
I wish a lot of things. I wish...

962
01:06:52,707 --> 01:06:56,632
It took my breath away,
this world they created.

963
01:06:59,588 --> 01:07:01,056
I was wrong

964
01:07:01,590 --> 01:07:04,560
about this, this girl.

965
01:07:16,147 --> 01:07:17,444
You did this?

966
01:07:17,565 --> 01:07:20,284
Yeah. Timothy and I did it together.

967
01:07:21,318 --> 01:07:22,410
I had made a mistake.

968
01:07:22,486 --> 01:07:23,578
We made lots of mistakes.

969
01:07:23,654 --> 01:07:26,658
Yeah, we made mistakes
trying to fix our mistakes.

970
01:07:26,741 --> 01:07:28,493
Isn't that how you know you're a parent?

971
01:07:32,329 --> 01:07:34,377
You seem to forget
what the object is here.

972
01:07:34,498 --> 01:07:36,296
You need to persuade us.

973
01:07:36,375 --> 01:07:38,673
Tell me, what would you do differently?

974
01:07:40,421 --> 01:07:41,843
We'd make better mistakes?

975
01:07:42,089 --> 01:07:43,511
- Better?
- Different. New.

976
01:07:43,591 --> 01:07:44,717
New mistakes.

977
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:47,098
That's... That's what we'd do.

978
01:07:47,178 --> 01:07:48,270
Yeah.

979
01:07:49,430 --> 01:07:51,683
Put your heart into it, Erasers!

980
01:07:52,850 --> 01:07:54,272
Smarten up out there.

981
01:07:54,351 --> 01:07:55,523
Bobby.

982
01:07:57,354 --> 01:07:58,571
The most amazing thing happened.

983
01:07:58,647 --> 01:08:00,775
I woke up this morning
and I started to draw again.

984
01:08:00,858 --> 01:08:03,452
Oh, God! It must be so nice to
have time to waste.

985
01:08:03,527 --> 01:08:04,528
It was like coming home.

986
01:08:04,612 --> 01:08:07,115
My three are so busy with
their second languages,

987
01:08:07,198 --> 01:08:08,199
their public service work...

988
01:08:08,282 --> 01:08:09,829
Oh, and their upcoming music recital.

989
01:08:09,909 --> 01:08:11,627
Your presence is expected.

990
01:08:11,702 --> 01:08:14,797
Let's go, Erasers! Come on!

991
01:08:17,792 --> 01:08:19,510
Brenda's freaking me out.

992
01:08:21,629 --> 01:08:22,881
What's wrong?

993
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:26,551
If you're on the bench now,

994
01:08:26,926 --> 01:08:29,349
you'll be on the bench of life later on.

995
01:08:29,428 --> 01:08:31,351
Jim, that is your father talking.

996
01:08:31,472 --> 01:08:32,849
Coach. Coach!

997
01:08:33,349 --> 01:08:34,817
Put Green in!

998
01:08:35,518 --> 01:08:36,644
Come on.

999
01:08:36,727 --> 01:08:38,354
Good, Coach. Thank you.

1000
01:08:38,437 --> 01:08:39,654
What are you doing? No, no, no. Jim...

1001
01:08:39,730 --> 01:08:40,777
Put...

1002
01:08:42,566 --> 01:08:43,738
What's going on?

1003
01:08:44,735 --> 01:08:46,829
Oh, great.
Now he's going to do that again.

1004
01:08:46,904 --> 01:08:48,326
What?

1005
01:08:48,405 --> 01:08:51,158
He's going to uncross his arms,
crack his knuckles,

1006
01:08:51,242 --> 01:08:52,368
then he will turn and go.

1007
01:08:52,451 --> 01:08:53,498
Yep.

1008
01:08:53,577 --> 01:08:55,295
It's fine that he did that to me,

1009
01:08:55,371 --> 01:08:56,748
but now he's doing it to Timothy.

1010
01:08:57,289 --> 01:08:58,415
Hey, Jim...

1011
01:08:58,582 --> 01:09:00,380
Look. Look.

1012
01:09:03,504 --> 01:09:04,676
Here, Grandpa Jim.

1013
01:09:05,756 --> 01:09:07,679
You know what I feel
really good about?

1014
01:09:07,758 --> 01:09:09,726
Bart and I are just grateful
that our kids' school

1015
01:09:09,802 --> 01:09:11,600
has a gifted and talented program.

1016
01:09:12,471 --> 01:09:13,848
Did you know Timothy is gifted?

1017
01:09:13,931 --> 01:09:15,274
How so?

1018
01:09:15,766 --> 01:09:16,813
Well...

1019
01:09:17,935 --> 01:09:19,937
He always finds the bright side.

1020
01:09:20,271 --> 01:09:22,774
He never gives up
and he has a good heart.

1021
01:09:22,940 --> 01:09:24,817
That will get you into college.

1022
01:09:27,528 --> 01:09:29,496
- He's a great artist.
- Look where that got you.

1023
01:09:29,572 --> 01:09:30,664
Get open!

1024
01:09:30,781 --> 01:09:33,534
Brenda, I have to say, lam...

1025
01:09:33,617 --> 01:09:34,914
What? I'm listening.

1026
01:09:35,870 --> 01:09:36,962
He's musical.

1027
01:09:38,789 --> 01:09:40,291
- Really?
- Yeah.

1028
01:09:41,458 --> 01:09:42,835
What instruments does he play?

1029
01:09:45,921 --> 01:09:48,470
"He's musical?"
What possessed you to even say that?

1030
01:09:48,632 --> 01:09:50,555
She just kept bragging
about how her kids could do this,

1031
01:09:50,634 --> 01:09:51,681
her kids could do that.

1032
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:54,730
So Cindy's sister
has this yearly family concert

1033
01:09:54,805 --> 01:09:56,307
that we never seem to miss.

1034
01:09:56,390 --> 01:09:58,563
If I'd known
what she was going to pull that day,

1035
01:09:58,642 --> 01:09:59,643
we never would have shown up.

1036
01:10:14,992 --> 01:10:17,495
Thank you. Thank you.

1037
01:10:18,329 --> 01:10:19,376
Brilliant.

1038
01:10:19,496 --> 01:10:22,796
Thank you. This year
we are going to dispense

1039
01:10:22,875 --> 01:10:24,752
with our traditional encore.

1040
01:10:24,835 --> 01:10:25,882
Oh!

1041
01:10:26,003 --> 01:10:29,724
Because we have a very special treat.

1042
01:10:29,798 --> 01:10:35,020
Sit back and enjoy
the musical stylings of Timothy Green!

1043
01:10:35,721 --> 01:10:37,849
You know what'?
We're running late to something.

1044
01:10:37,932 --> 01:10:39,354
Go ahead and do the encore because...

1045
01:10:39,475 --> 01:10:41,694
No, Mom, it's okay. It's fine, Mom.

1046
01:10:42,978 --> 01:10:43,979
Um, Timothy?

1047
01:10:44,063 --> 01:10:45,406
- Hey, pal.
- Hey.

1048
01:10:45,481 --> 01:10:46,528
It's okay.

1049
01:11:02,665 --> 01:11:04,633
Just get him, baby. Just go.

1050
01:11:05,501 --> 01:11:06,798
Just get him. Get him.

1051
01:11:08,545 --> 01:11:09,671
Just go get him.

1052
01:11:09,755 --> 01:11:11,052
Hey, pal?

1053
01:11:34,738 --> 01:11:38,834
All my friends know the low rider

1054
01:11:41,745 --> 01:11:45,750
The low rider is a little higher

1055
01:12:09,773 --> 01:12:10,945
Yeah!

1056
01:12:21,994 --> 01:12:22,995
Yeah!

1057
01:12:23,412 --> 01:12:24,709
Can we go back and do it again?

1058
01:12:24,788 --> 01:12:25,914
No.

1059
01:12:25,998 --> 01:12:27,545
I don't think we'll be invited back.

1060
01:12:27,624 --> 01:12:29,718
But it doesn't matter
because you were great.

1061
01:12:29,793 --> 01:12:30,885
You rock, buddy.

1062
01:12:30,961 --> 01:12:32,713
It felt great to rock.

1063
01:12:32,796 --> 01:12:34,798
It felt great to have a kid who rocked.

1064
01:12:35,883 --> 01:12:37,100
- Good night.
- Good night.

1065
01:12:37,885 --> 01:12:39,182
It was all you.

1066
01:12:39,470 --> 01:12:40,847
And us, but mostly you.

1067
01:12:40,971 --> 01:12:42,018
Hey.

1068
01:12:44,808 --> 01:12:46,606
- We were proud of you.
- Mmm-hmm.

1069
01:12:46,894 --> 01:12:49,647
Turn the lights off in five, okay?

1070
01:12:50,481 --> 01:12:51,698
Good night!

1071
01:12:56,653 --> 01:12:57,654
We rocked!

1072
01:12:57,780 --> 01:12:58,747
We did.

1073
01:12:58,822 --> 01:12:59,823
We rocked!

1074
01:12:59,907 --> 01:13:01,033
You know what this means?

1075
01:13:01,116 --> 01:13:02,584
I think I do!

1076
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:05,629
This Sunday at the championship game

1077
01:13:05,704 --> 01:13:09,459
our son is going to
score the winning goal.

1078
01:13:34,024 --> 01:13:35,526
Whoo! Let's go!

1079
01:13:37,236 --> 01:13:39,955
Ha! Yeah! Let's go!

1080
01:13:44,118 --> 01:13:45,210
All right, way to go, Coach!

1081
01:13:48,330 --> 01:13:49,377
No! No!

1082
01:13:49,456 --> 01:13:52,050
No, no, no. No, you don't! Not this time!

1083
01:13:52,501 --> 01:13:54,503
- You are staying for this one!
- I can't stay.

1084
01:13:54,586 --> 01:13:56,133
- You're staying.
- I got lots, I got a lot...

1085
01:13:56,213 --> 01:13:57,760
You will not be sorry!

1086
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:01,052
I promise you.

1087
01:14:03,220 --> 01:14:04,972
- Okay.
- All right. Come on! Come on!

1088
01:14:05,973 --> 01:14:07,065
Yes!

1089
01:14:10,561 --> 01:14:12,984
Hey, Jim, how's he going to
score the winning goal

1090
01:14:13,063 --> 01:14:14,815
if he's never in the game?

1091
01:14:14,898 --> 01:14:16,024
Good point.

1092
01:14:17,776 --> 01:14:20,825
Hey, Coach. Coach, I just want
to give you the heads-up.

1093
01:14:20,904 --> 01:14:23,623
Timothy Green is
your difference-maker today.

1094
01:14:23,699 --> 01:14:25,121
That is your game-changer right there.

1095
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:26,793
You're kidding, right?

1096
01:14:26,869 --> 01:14:28,212
Do I look like I'm kidding?

1097
01:14:28,287 --> 01:14:29,834
If I put your son in the game,

1098
01:14:29,913 --> 01:14:31,506
he wouldn't live to see
his next birthday.

1099
01:14:31,582 --> 01:14:33,175
If you don't mind,
we got a game to win.

1100
01:14:33,250 --> 01:14:35,878
Erasers, this is our time.
This is our time.

1101
01:14:35,961 --> 01:14:37,713
Warm him up, Coach!

1102
01:14:37,796 --> 01:14:39,798
Come on, Timothy!
Let's see you run some drills.

1103
01:14:39,882 --> 01:14:41,759
How about he runs some drills, Coach?

1104
01:14:42,801 --> 01:14:44,098
You better stretch, baby!

1105
01:14:44,636 --> 01:14:45,979
What did he say?

1106
01:14:46,096 --> 01:14:48,565
- He's going to play.
- Is he going to do it?

1107
01:14:51,852 --> 01:14:53,946
Get open! Get open!
That's yours right there!

1108
01:14:54,021 --> 01:14:56,570
There you go, son. There you go, son.

1109
01:14:59,276 --> 01:15:02,951
All right, Erasers!
Bring the championship home!

1110
01:15:10,162 --> 01:15:11,630
Spread out!

1111
01:15:33,310 --> 01:15:34,812
"Yes!
-om

1112
01:15:34,895 --> 01:15:35,987
- No! Jim!
- No!

1113
01:15:36,897 --> 01:15:38,149
Is he okay?

1114
01:15:38,982 --> 01:15:40,279
I hope he's okay.

1115
01:15:41,318 --> 01:15:42,661
Oh, no!

1116
01:15:43,111 --> 01:15:44,283
Time! Time!

1117
01:15:45,989 --> 01:15:47,286
It's going to be okay.

1118
01:15:48,825 --> 01:15:50,577
-Who's that?
-I have no idea.

1119
01:15:50,661 --> 01:15:52,163
- Is that the Henderson kid?
- Maybe.

1120
01:15:52,871 --> 01:15:53,963
He's not that good.

1121
01:15:55,874 --> 01:15:56,875
He's okay!

1122
01:15:57,167 --> 01:15:59,716
He's okay! It's okay.

1123
01:16:03,674 --> 01:16:05,142
I can get you some water.

1124
01:16:05,968 --> 01:16:07,811
- Way to go.
- Okay.

1125
01:16:11,181 --> 01:16:12,728
- Watch this.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1126
01:16:12,808 --> 01:16:13,855
This is what we've been waiting for.

1127
01:16:13,934 --> 01:16:14,935
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1128
01:16:15,018 --> 01:16:17,066
- He's coming in.
- We're going with ten.

1129
01:16:17,271 --> 01:16:18,773
- Okay, Coach.
- What?

1130
01:16:18,855 --> 01:16:20,698
No, no. Ref, come here.

1131
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:23,118
They've only got ten kids on the field.

1132
01:16:23,193 --> 01:16:24,991
What about zero?
Why isn't zero playing?

1133
01:16:25,070 --> 01:16:26,413
- I thought he was a mascot.
- No.

1134
01:16:26,613 --> 01:16:28,081
No, he's on the team.

1135
01:16:29,074 --> 01:16:30,792
There's got to be a rule.

1136
01:16:31,660 --> 01:16:34,288
Get the book.
Hundred fifty-four rule or whatever.

1137
01:16:34,413 --> 01:16:35,881
Jim, is there a rule?

1138
01:16:37,874 --> 01:16:38,921
Coach, you need 11 players on the field.

1139
01:16:39,001 --> 01:16:39,968
He doesn't play.

1140
01:16:40,043 --> 01:16:41,044
Is he on your team?

1141
01:16:41,128 --> 01:16:42,129
Yeah, he's on the team, but...

1142
01:16:42,212 --> 01:16:44,055
Then he plays. Let's go, Coach.

1143
01:16:51,054 --> 01:16:53,352
Okay, Green, come on. Come on.

1144
01:17:00,981 --> 01:17:03,075
Our son's going to
score the winning goal.

1145
01:17:05,152 --> 01:17:08,406
I want you to plant your feet
right here, son. Okay?

1146
01:17:09,114 --> 01:17:11,208
And whatever you do,
don't move from this spot.

1147
01:17:11,283 --> 01:17:12,284
You're safe here, okay?

1148
01:17:12,367 --> 01:17:13,914
- Got it, Coach.
- All right. There you go.

1149
01:17:13,994 --> 01:17:15,120
Coach, let's go.

1150
01:17:15,203 --> 01:17:16,796
All right, buddy. This is what it's about!

1151
01:17:17,789 --> 01:17:19,462
This is where you find out who you are.

1152
01:17:21,710 --> 01:17:23,804
No more bench of life.

1153
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:25,388
Oh, hit me with a stick.

1154
01:17:25,464 --> 01:17:27,011
They're not putting that boy in!

1155
01:17:27,090 --> 01:17:30,139
Actually, they are. It's good. Trust me.

1156
01:17:30,427 --> 01:17:32,100
Laugh if you want.

1157
01:17:32,179 --> 01:17:34,102
My kid is going to
score the winning goal.

1158
01:17:36,016 --> 01:17:37,768
Two minutes left in the game.

1159
01:17:37,851 --> 01:17:39,103
Who's your daddy?

1160
01:17:40,062 --> 01:17:41,154
Has he been drinking?

1161
01:17:41,229 --> 01:17:43,323
No, no. He just knows what's coming.

1162
01:17:44,316 --> 01:17:45,738
No more bench of life.

1163
01:17:46,151 --> 01:17:47,994
Do that thing you're going to do!

1164
01:17:49,446 --> 01:17:50,789
This is it. Come on!

1165
01:17:51,448 --> 01:17:52,950
Come on,
Erasers, let's go!

1166
01:17:53,033 --> 01:17:54,831
You can do it! You can do it!

1167
01:17:54,951 --> 01:17:57,170
Let's go! Let me see
some fight, Erasers!

1168
01:17:57,788 --> 01:17:59,210
Put some heart into it!

1169
01:18:01,083 --> 01:18:02,460
That's what I'm talking about, Green.

1170
01:18:02,793 --> 01:18:04,795
That's what
I'm talking about. Keep that up.

1171
01:18:05,003 --> 01:18:06,129
Timothy. Timothy.

1172
01:18:07,297 --> 01:18:08,423
You got to move your feet. Come on.

1173
01:18:09,257 --> 01:18:10,850
No. Stay right there, son.

1174
01:18:10,967 --> 01:18:12,844
- Stay right there.
- Don't listen to Coach Cal!

1175
01:18:12,969 --> 01:18:14,266
Don't listen to your father!

1176
01:18:14,346 --> 01:18:16,223
Timothy, Timothy.
Look at me. Don't listen to Coach Cal.

1177
01:18:16,306 --> 01:18:17,899
Move your feet. Move around!

1178
01:18:18,100 --> 01:18:20,523
Green, Green. Stay right there.
You're doing great!

1179
01:18:20,811 --> 01:18:21,858
Feel it out, Timothy!

1180
01:18:21,978 --> 01:18:23,321
Come on, move around!

1181
01:18:23,438 --> 01:18:25,816
Chase the ball! Come on!

1182
01:18:27,150 --> 01:18:29,824
Way to go. Way to go.
Way to go, Tim.

1183
01:18:53,260 --> 01:18:54,477
God, he's doing that thing again.

1184
01:18:54,553 --> 01:18:57,102
No, no. Put your arms down.
Arms down.

1185
01:18:57,180 --> 01:18:58,306
Get your head in the game, baby!

1186
01:18:58,390 --> 01:18:59,391
Get your head in the game.

1187
01:18:59,474 --> 01:19:01,067
Get in the game!

1188
01:19:01,143 --> 01:19:03,237
Like we worked it, come on!

1189
01:19:25,584 --> 01:19:27,461
There you go, Erasers,
there you go!

1190
01:19:27,586 --> 01:19:28,929
Yes! Yes!

1191
01:19:29,004 --> 01:19:30,551
There it is! There it is!

1192
01:19:30,839 --> 01:19:32,136
Get back in! Get back in!

1193
01:19:34,050 --> 01:19:35,552
No, no. Put your arms down. Arms down.

1194
01:19:36,178 --> 01:19:37,555
No, no, no! Don't do that!

1195
01:19:38,138 --> 01:19:40,436
Do something with it! Do something!

1196
01:19:43,894 --> 01:19:45,066
- Yes! Yes!
- Come on!

1197
01:19:45,395 --> 01:19:46,396
Yes!

1198
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:47,857
That's what we're talking about.

1199
01:19:51,151 --> 01:19:54,155
All right, Green!
Come on! That's your house!

1200
01:19:56,907 --> 01:19:58,454
Just like we practiced!

1201
01:19:59,451 --> 01:20:01,044
Look at his little legs!

1202
01:20:01,119 --> 01:20:02,211
I don't believe it.

1203
01:20:02,287 --> 01:20:03,584
Oh, believe it, sister.

1204
01:20:03,872 --> 01:20:06,546
For years I've been listening to
how perfect your kids are!

1205
01:20:06,625 --> 01:20:09,128
Well, look at that! That kid is mine!

1206
01:20:10,170 --> 01:20:11,968
I am the mom of that!

1207
01:20:13,340 --> 01:20:15,434
Get that kid! Put him on the ground!

1208
01:20:16,218 --> 01:20:18,516
Take his knees out!
Put him on the ground!

1209
01:20:21,014 --> 01:20:23,358
See? See?

1210
01:20:23,433 --> 01:20:25,435
See what happens
when you're there for your kid!

1211
01:20:25,519 --> 01:20:27,317
Huh? See what happens
when you believe in him! Huh?

1212
01:20:27,395 --> 01:20:30,990
I could have been like that,
because I had skills, but no.

1213
01:20:31,066 --> 01:20:33,535
Come on, Timothy! Go! Go!

1214
01:20:33,610 --> 01:20:35,032
Go, Timothy! Go!

1215
01:20:52,963 --> 01:20:54,055
No!

1216
01:20:57,300 --> 01:20:58,643
That's the wrong goal!

1217
01:20:58,927 --> 01:21:00,144
Game Bone Crushers!

1218
01:21:01,972 --> 01:21:03,064
Oh!

1219
01:21:06,434 --> 01:21:07,481
Oh!

1220
01:21:12,524 --> 01:21:13,616
But he...

1221
01:21:37,007 --> 01:21:38,259
Just like you practiced it, huh?

1222
01:22:03,366 --> 01:22:05,460
When we're dreaming up the kid that
we never thought we would get,

1223
01:22:05,535 --> 01:22:06,957
I should have said,
"The winning goal for his team!"

1224
01:22:07,037 --> 01:22:08,380
- That's not what I'm saying!
- What are you saying?

1225
01:22:08,455 --> 01:22:09,456
Shut Up!

1226
01:22:09,539 --> 01:22:10,665
It was a failure of my imagination!

1227
01:22:10,749 --> 01:22:12,422
Your mistake was simple!

1228
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:14,969
Oh, my mistake?
So, you think it was my fault?

1229
01:22:15,045 --> 01:22:17,218
You needed him to
score for you to make you...

1230
01:22:18,173 --> 01:22:20,221
Tell me you didn't love

1231
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:22,302
the idea of rubbing it in Brenda's face.

1232
01:22:22,427 --> 01:22:23,474
Oh, please!

1233
01:22:23,553 --> 01:22:25,601
You think you're better than your sister,
and you're not.

1234
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:27,728
You are worse than your father!

1235
01:22:29,643 --> 01:22:30,735
What?

1236
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:38,572
No.

1237
01:22:40,195 --> 01:22:41,321
No, no, no.

1238
01:22:41,404 --> 01:22:42,701
Stop it!

1239
01:22:44,199 --> 01:22:47,043
I am not the only bad parent
in this house!

1240
01:22:47,118 --> 01:22:48,461
Look, it's not a competition

1241
01:22:48,536 --> 01:22:50,163
to see who can be the worst parent!

1242
01:22:50,246 --> 01:22:52,123
No, I am saying
we're both terrible at this!

1243
01:22:52,207 --> 01:22:54,005
We are! We don't know anything!

1244
01:22:54,084 --> 01:22:55,381
You're right! We know nothing!

1245
01:22:55,460 --> 01:22:57,554
We were monsters out there today.

1246
01:22:57,629 --> 01:22:59,506
Stop! Stop fighting!

1247
01:22:59,589 --> 01:23:00,715
Oh, God.

1248
01:23:04,094 --> 01:23:05,220
I need to tell you something.

1249
01:23:05,303 --> 01:23:07,271
Buddy, we want to tell you something.

1250
01:23:07,347 --> 01:23:08,473
- No!
- You deserve better.

1251
01:23:08,556 --> 01:23:10,558
We will be better parents.
We will do better.

1252
01:23:10,642 --> 01:23:12,019
- I promise.
- Please...

1253
01:23:12,102 --> 01:23:13,194
Stop.

1254
01:23:15,605 --> 01:23:17,073
Your time is up.

1255
01:23:17,190 --> 01:23:18,282
- No, it can't be.
- No.

1256
01:23:18,358 --> 01:23:19,450
Actually, you ran over.

1257
01:23:19,526 --> 01:23:21,403
- By three minutes.
- You have to let us finish.

1258
01:23:21,486 --> 01:23:23,705
You have to hear the whole thing.
You have to.

1259
01:23:23,780 --> 01:23:26,158
Excuse me.
With all due respect, we're not leaving.

1260
01:23:34,165 --> 01:23:35,212
Okay.

1261
01:23:37,252 --> 01:23:40,131
Tots, Timbo? There you go.

1262
01:23:43,466 --> 01:23:44,763
Get them next year.

1263
01:23:46,636 --> 01:23:48,138
- Want some?
- No, thank you.

1264
01:23:52,475 --> 01:23:54,477
Boys, come on.
We're going home.

1265
01:23:55,145 --> 01:23:56,522
We're going home! What did I say?

1266
01:23:56,604 --> 01:23:58,606
No, that's somebody's job.
Let's go.

1267
01:24:01,151 --> 01:24:02,403
Mom and Dad?

1268
01:24:04,446 --> 01:24:07,416
This is Joni,
the coolest girl you ever hope to meet.

1269
01:24:09,325 --> 01:24:10,372
Wow. Hi.

1270
01:24:10,827 --> 01:24:12,670
Nice to see you again.

1271
01:24:12,746 --> 01:24:13,838
Hi.

1272
01:24:14,706 --> 01:24:17,459
Well, okay, bye.

1273
01:24:21,671 --> 01:24:22,718
There it is.

1274
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:25,342
Love and be loved.

1275
01:24:30,263 --> 01:24:32,766
-Where are they going?
-I don't know.

1276
01:24:33,850 --> 01:24:35,568
Let them go. Let them go.

1277
01:24:43,818 --> 01:24:44,865
Yeah.

1278
01:24:46,488 --> 01:24:48,365
I know we've
had a great time together.

1279
01:24:48,448 --> 01:24:49,540
Me, too.

1280
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:52,623
I didn't tell my parents because

1281
01:24:52,869 --> 01:24:55,088
they couldn't have
done anything about it.

1282
01:24:58,291 --> 01:25:00,134
There's something
you need to know about me.

1283
01:25:00,210 --> 01:25:01,211
What is it?

1284
01:25:14,891 --> 01:25:16,893
There's nothing I can do about it.

1285
01:25:18,394 --> 01:25:20,067
Everything's going to be okay.

1286
01:25:28,071 --> 01:25:29,163
Good night.

1287
01:25:29,239 --> 01:25:30,411
Oh, good night.

1288
01:25:30,490 --> 01:25:31,582
Timothy!

1289
01:25:38,081 --> 01:25:40,083
Oh, I am so confused.

1290
01:26:02,105 --> 01:26:03,152
Guys?

1291
01:26:04,399 --> 01:26:05,491
Oh, hey!

1292
01:26:07,443 --> 01:26:08,490
We were spying-

1293
01:26:08,570 --> 01:26:09,867
Yeah, we couldn't help ourselves.

1294
01:26:09,946 --> 01:26:11,539
- Oh, she's lovely.
- Yeah.

1295
01:26:12,115 --> 01:26:13,913
We really like her.

1296
01:26:13,992 --> 01:26:14,993
Yeah.

1297
01:26:15,118 --> 01:26:16,335
I more than like her.

1298
01:26:16,411 --> 01:26:17,879
Well, of course.

1299
01:26:17,954 --> 01:26:19,331
Oh, I am so confused.

1300
01:26:19,414 --> 01:26:21,212
But it looks like
you just broke up with her.

1301
01:26:21,416 --> 01:26:24,215
No. I let her go.

1302
01:26:25,128 --> 01:26:26,471
Why would you do that?

1303
01:26:26,546 --> 01:26:27,547
Especially if you more than like her.

1304
01:26:27,630 --> 01:26:28,631
Yeah.

1305
01:26:29,632 --> 01:26:31,259
You don't get it.

1306
01:26:35,638 --> 01:26:37,015
He was right.

1307
01:26:38,099 --> 01:26:39,351
We didn't get it.

1308
01:26:40,977 --> 01:26:42,479
But we were about to.

1309
01:26:43,438 --> 01:26:44,610
We just want to work!

1310
01:26:44,689 --> 01:26:45,611
Yeah, we want to work.

1311
01:26:46,357 --> 01:26:47,574
My grandfather worked for you.

1312
01:26:47,984 --> 01:26:50,078
My father did. My brothers.

1313
01:26:50,153 --> 01:26:52,576
24 years! He's given you 24 years!

1314
01:26:52,655 --> 01:26:53,747
The meeting was about

1315
01:26:53,823 --> 01:26:55,416
whether the factory was going to close.

1316
01:26:55,491 --> 01:26:57,459
He was right.

1317
01:26:57,994 --> 01:26:59,746
Good evening.
I know you're all upset,

1318
01:26:59,996 --> 01:27:01,373
but if you could just
give me a few minutes.

1319
01:27:02,123 --> 01:27:03,750
You've heard the rumors

1320
01:27:03,833 --> 01:27:05,380
that our factory here in Stanleyville

1321
01:27:05,460 --> 01:27:06,677
is going to close.

1322
01:27:07,045 --> 01:27:10,015
That's what we thought.
As it turned out...

1323
01:27:10,131 --> 01:27:15,012
But... But something
unexpected happened.

1324
01:27:15,428 --> 01:27:19,274
A little miracle. And here it is.

1325
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:22,443
This is a new kind of pencil

1326
01:27:22,518 --> 01:27:25,442
made almost entirely out of leaves.

1327
01:27:25,521 --> 01:27:26,522
A new kind of pencil.

1328
01:27:28,149 --> 01:27:30,117
The pencil that Timothy
had asked us to make.

1329
01:27:30,318 --> 01:27:34,494
It will not only save trees,
but will save our factory.

1330
01:27:40,536 --> 01:27:41,708
Don't thank me.

1331
01:27:41,788 --> 01:27:43,131
I did not have the vision

1332
01:27:43,206 --> 01:27:44,799
to come up with this revolutionary idea.

1333
01:27:45,208 --> 01:27:48,178
But allow me to
introduce you to who did.

1334
01:27:49,671 --> 01:27:53,141
My son, Franklin Crudstaff.

1335
01:27:58,388 --> 01:28:03,110
I can't begin to
describe the feeling of pride I have.

1336
01:28:03,559 --> 01:28:05,061
Quite frankly, Franklin,

1337
01:28:05,144 --> 01:28:07,238
I didn't think you had it in you.

1338
01:28:07,522 --> 01:28:08,569
He didn't.

1339
01:28:09,732 --> 01:28:11,325
He didn't have it in him.

1340
01:28:11,401 --> 01:28:13,199
The new pencil
was thought up by my parents,

1341
01:28:13,277 --> 01:28:14,403
Jim and Cindy Green.

1342
01:28:16,072 --> 01:28:17,039
Oh, look here.

1343
01:28:17,115 --> 01:28:18,207
It's the boy who kicked the winning goal

1344
01:28:18,282 --> 01:28:19,659
for the other team.

1345
01:28:21,035 --> 01:28:22,833
Hey, hey, stop, Franklin.

1346
01:28:22,912 --> 01:28:25,210
Well, he's obviously confused again.

1347
01:28:25,289 --> 01:28:27,212
He shoots. He scores. We lose.

1348
01:28:27,333 --> 01:28:31,304
Hey! Enough. Do not pick on my son.

1349
01:28:33,297 --> 01:28:34,469
The truth is,

1350
01:28:34,549 --> 01:28:37,769
the only reason that
Cindy and I came up

1351
01:28:37,844 --> 01:28:39,517
with the idea for the leaf pencil

1352
01:28:39,595 --> 01:28:42,348
is because he believed
that we could. He's the reason.

1353
01:28:43,266 --> 01:28:44,518
And if you call him a liar,

1354
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:47,319
if you ever so much as
even look at him funny,

1355
01:28:47,395 --> 01:28:49,068
you will have to deal with me.

1356
01:28:49,147 --> 01:28:50,239
And me.

1357
01:28:56,821 --> 01:28:58,164
How touching.

1358
01:29:01,284 --> 01:29:04,788
Tell me, how did you
come up with this idea

1359
01:29:04,871 --> 01:29:07,624
to make a pencil out of leaves.

1360
01:29:08,166 --> 01:29:09,292
Franklin?

1361
01:29:13,337 --> 01:29:15,760
Well, it seems kind of obvious, really.

1362
01:29:16,466 --> 01:29:19,686
Uh, leaves are everywhere. And, uh...

1363
01:29:21,637 --> 01:29:23,264
-...pencil.
- How about you?

1364
01:29:25,892 --> 01:29:29,396
Ever since Timothy came to us,
leaves have been a big,

1365
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:31,823
a big part of our lives.

1366
01:29:32,190 --> 01:29:33,487
Why?

1367
01:29:35,651 --> 01:29:36,652
Well?

1368
01:29:37,653 --> 01:29:39,405
Because I have leaves on my legs.

1369
01:29:42,325 --> 01:29:43,793
Leaves on your legs.

1370
01:29:45,161 --> 01:29:49,507
Yes. Our son, Timothy,
has leaves on his legs.

1371
01:29:53,211 --> 01:29:55,680
And we didn't tell
you guys because we were afraid.

1372
01:29:57,840 --> 01:29:59,342
And kind of ashamed.

1373
01:30:01,385 --> 01:30:03,183
I even tried to cut his leaves off.

1374
01:30:03,304 --> 01:30:05,602
Surely you don't
expect us to believe that...

1375
01:30:05,681 --> 01:30:07,183
I've seen the leaves.

1376
01:30:08,267 --> 01:30:09,393
They're spectacular.

1377
01:30:10,645 --> 01:30:13,444
And it's okay to be different.
A little weird, even.

1378
01:30:15,858 --> 01:30:16,859
Thank you.

1379
01:30:19,737 --> 01:30:21,410
It doesn't matter if
you believe us or not.

1380
01:30:21,489 --> 01:30:23,207
I'd like to see the leaves.

1381
01:30:30,498 --> 01:30:32,500
It is up to you. You don't have to.

1382
01:30:32,583 --> 01:30:35,211
It's okay. It's time.

1383
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:53,567
Oops.

1384
01:31:06,576 --> 01:31:08,670
Now that's amazing.

1385
01:31:10,872 --> 01:31:12,419
I used to have more.

1386
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,549
If this boy can
have a leaf on his ankle,

1387
01:31:16,627 --> 01:31:18,846
then we can make
a pencil out of leaves.

1388
01:31:19,505 --> 01:31:20,973
Let's all go to work!

1389
01:31:31,309 --> 01:31:33,482
Wow!
You guys were incredible.

1390
01:31:33,603 --> 01:31:36,482
Timothy, what happened to your leaves?

1391
01:31:37,523 --> 01:31:38,945
Oh, you know.

1392
01:31:39,692 --> 01:31:42,286
No. We don't know.

1393
01:31:42,904 --> 01:31:44,372
He wouldn't tell us.

1394
01:31:44,447 --> 01:31:45,699
No. He was quiet.

1395
01:31:59,962 --> 01:32:02,761
We were in
the middle of something.

1396
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:04,592
We didn't know what.

1397
01:32:08,638 --> 01:32:11,642
But Timothy knew. He stayed calm.

1398
01:32:12,391 --> 01:32:14,940
He knew, and he was okay with it.

1399
01:32:24,362 --> 01:32:25,659
It was beautiful.

1400
01:32:26,614 --> 01:32:27,911
It was really beautiful.

1401
01:32:30,326 --> 01:32:31,498
Timothy.

1402
01:32:32,703 --> 01:32:34,000
What aren't you telling us?

1403
01:32:35,748 --> 01:32:37,000
We should get inside.

1404
01:32:37,750 --> 01:32:39,047
- Get inside.
- Come on.

1405
01:32:48,970 --> 01:32:49,937
I didn't tell you before

1406
01:32:50,012 --> 01:32:51,855
because there's nothing
you could have done.

1407
01:32:55,518 --> 01:32:56,940
About my leaves...

1408
01:32:57,937 --> 01:32:59,029
What about them?

1409
01:33:00,690 --> 01:33:01,737
Please, please tell us.

1410
01:33:03,859 --> 01:33:05,327
When my leaves go...

1411
01:33:08,406 --> 01:33:09,908
You go, too, don't you?

1412
01:33:14,870 --> 01:33:16,372
When?

1413
01:33:24,463 --> 01:33:25,464
Now.

1414
01:33:25,673 --> 01:33:26,970
No, no.

1415
01:33:27,550 --> 01:33:29,894
No, sweetie. You can't.

1416
01:33:30,052 --> 01:33:33,056
It's nothing you did.
It's how it's supposed to be.

1417
01:33:33,639 --> 01:33:35,061
There's only so much time.

1418
01:33:36,392 --> 01:33:38,645
Other kids grow up and move away.

1419
01:33:39,562 --> 01:33:41,530
I lose my leaves and move on.

1420
01:33:41,647 --> 01:33:42,773
Oh, sweetie, you can't.

1421
01:33:43,441 --> 01:33:45,569
There is so much that
we have left to do.

1422
01:33:45,651 --> 01:33:47,699
We're just starting
to get good at this.

1423
01:33:47,778 --> 01:33:49,405
You're ready.

1424
01:33:50,031 --> 01:33:51,783
- You were always ready.
- Oh, baby.

1425
01:33:56,287 --> 01:33:57,459
Never give up.

1426
01:34:06,547 --> 01:34:07,548
Timothy?

1427
01:34:08,090 --> 01:34:09,512
- Timothy?
- Jim.

1428
01:34:15,931 --> 01:34:17,023
Oh!

1429
01:34:22,563 --> 01:34:23,815
- Jim.
- Yeah?

1430
01:34:54,095 --> 01:34:55,096
Oh, Jim.

1431
01:34:57,056 --> 01:34:58,729
Here, here, here, here.

1432
01:35:32,758 --> 01:35:34,010
What was in the box?

1433
01:35:45,646 --> 01:35:46,863
This.

1434
01:36:10,838 --> 01:36:13,557
Thank you. I think that's
all we'll need.

1435
01:36:16,218 --> 01:36:17,561
That's it?

1436
01:36:18,220 --> 01:36:19,221
That...

1437
01:36:19,513 --> 01:36:20,639
Thank you.

1438
01:36:20,973 --> 01:36:22,065
Thank you.

1439
01:36:32,568 --> 01:36:34,036
Dear Mom and Dad.

1440
01:36:36,780 --> 01:36:40,580
About my leaves,
I gave them all away.

1441
01:36:42,661 --> 01:36:44,254
It's what you do with gifts.

1442
01:36:47,124 --> 01:36:49,001
I gave one to Aunt Brenda

1443
01:36:50,252 --> 01:36:52,050
so now she can rock.

1444
01:36:56,759 --> 01:36:58,807
I wanted Uncle Bub to have one.

1445
01:37:01,263 --> 01:37:02,640
And Miss Crudstaff.

1446
01:37:04,767 --> 01:37:08,897
Coach Cal got one.
He said it was my best kick ever.

1447
01:37:10,898 --> 01:37:14,198
I gave one to Reggie,
because he really liked them.

1448
01:37:18,572 --> 01:37:22,827
<i>I left one for Grandpa Jim
where I know he'll find it.</i>

1449
01:37:31,168 --> 01:37:34,138
And Joni, she got two.

1450
01:37:36,799 --> 01:37:40,975
And for you guys, here's what I know.

1451
01:37:43,639 --> 01:37:45,641
If you came to me and said,

1452
01:37:46,141 --> 01:37:48,235
"There are two people in the world

1453
01:37:48,310 --> 01:37:50,153
"who want you more than anything."

1454
01:37:50,229 --> 01:37:51,321
Jim!

1455
01:37:52,147 --> 01:37:56,197
"They'll do their best.
They'll make some mistakes.

1456
01:37:57,319 --> 01:38:00,038
"And you'll only get them
for a short time.

1457
01:38:01,699 --> 01:38:04,669
"But they will love you
more than you can ever imagine. "

1458
01:38:08,747 --> 01:38:12,342
Well, when that's true, I'd say,

1459
01:38:14,336 --> 01:38:16,338
"So much is possible. "

1460
01:38:36,191 --> 01:38:37,283
Hi.

1461
01:38:38,611 --> 01:38:39,703
Hi.

1462
01:38:40,070 --> 01:38:41,196
Hi.

1463
01:38:42,239 --> 01:38:43,331
I'm Cindy.

1464
01:38:43,741 --> 01:38:44,867
I'm Jim.

1465
01:38:49,204 --> 01:38:50,251
And you can call us...

1466
01:38:50,331 --> 01:38:51,833
Whatever you want.

1467
01:38:53,042 --> 01:38:54,294
I'm Lily.

1468
01:38:58,631 --> 01:39:00,008
You want to come inside?

1469
01:40:11,870 --> 01:40:15,124
# This gift will last forever

1470
01:40:15,207 --> 01:40:18,461
# This gift will never let you down

1471
01:40:18,544 --> 01:40:22,094
# Some things are made
from better stuff

1472
01:40:22,172 --> 01:40:25,267
# This gift is waiting to be found

1473
01:40:25,342 --> 01:40:28,642
# Your heart's in wide receiving

1474
01:40:28,721 --> 01:40:32,146
# Been too long buried in the sand

1475
01:40:32,224 --> 01:40:35,569
# Some things require leaving

1476
01:40:35,644 --> 01:40:42,368
# This gift will fall right in your hand

1477
01:40:43,444 --> 01:40:47,665
# Just try to understand

1478
01:40:51,034 --> 01:40:56,382
# If you long enough

1479
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:02,881
# And you don't give up

1480
01:41:04,715 --> 01:41:09,846
# If you're strong enough

1481
01:41:11,346 --> 01:41:16,318
# And you don't give up

1482
01:41:18,270 --> 01:41:23,026
# And you'll be no harbor

1483
01:41:24,693 --> 01:41:28,539
# To the sorrow

1484
01:41:31,325 --> 01:41:32,326
# Just let it go

1485
01:42:13,200 --> 01:42:16,204
# Don't hang your head in sorrow

1486
01:42:16,286 --> 01:42:19,631
# Don't give up just before you win

1487
01:42:19,706 --> 01:42:22,926
# Don't wait around for tomorrow

1488
01:42:23,001 --> 01:42:26,221
# Open up your arms and let it in

1489
01:42:26,296 --> 01:42:29,550
# This gift will last forever

1490
01:42:29,633 --> 01:42:32,933
# This gift will never let you down

# This gift is ready to be found

1493
01:42:44,273 --> 01:42:50,952

1504
01:43:38,368 --> 01:43:44,967
