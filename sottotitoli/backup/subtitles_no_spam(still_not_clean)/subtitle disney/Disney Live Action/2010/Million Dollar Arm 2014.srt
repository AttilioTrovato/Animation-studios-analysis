00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,363
<i>performance from Alastair Cook...</i>

173
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,890
(VOCALIZING)

174
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,970
Hey. How fast do they pitch in cricket?

175
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,810
Fine, bowl.
How fast do they bowl in cricket?

176
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,850
You know what?
Get me a meeting with Chang this week.

177
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,368
I think I cracked this.

178
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,605
They don't play baseball in India.

179
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,728
That's right. They don't.
They play cricket.

180
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:12,005
But we think that we can convert
a cricket bowler into a baseball pitcher.

181
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:16,560
Look, India is the last
great untapped market.

182
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,570
We find new fans there
for American baseball,

183
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,921
the financial opportunities are endless.

184
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,049
Mr. Chang, if we can deliver
to Major League Baseball

185
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,771
its first Indian ballplayer,

186
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,649
that's a billion new fans.

187
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,644
What do a billion new fans need?

188
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,121
A billion hats. A billion T-shirts.

189
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,965
And you wanna set this up
like it's a talent contest?

190
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,201
Exactly.

191
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:43,126
That will ensure
maximum exposure of talent to press.

192
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,565
See, once we go over there
and find these guys,

193
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,325
we bring them back here,
we train them in LA,

194
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,607
and then we get them signed
with a professional franchise.

195
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,521
- What's your timeline?
- Two years.

196
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,491
Can you do it in one?

197
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,321
Sure.

198
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,887
Really? A year? Because
I thought we said two.

199
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,961
I had to hook him.

200
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,805
Okay, we can't find
and train two nobodies in a year.

201
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,001
It can't be done.

202
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,485
Well, without this deal, we're done.

203
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,801
So I just saved our business, Aash.
You should be thanking me.

204
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,286
Oh, I would thank you
if the deal wasn't insane.

205
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,290
- Well, apparently Chang didn't think so.
- Chang is rich.

206
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,765
You know what rich people can do?

207
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,808
They can be insane. We can't, okay?

208
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,161
We can't find somebody
who has never picked up a baseball

209
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,004
and teach them how to pitch.

210
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,765
You're right, we can't.
But I know someone who can.

211
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,044
Cross it over.

212
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,485
Bend it deep.

213
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,204
Pre-set your fanny.

214
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,809
Lift and plant hard.

215
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,560
Thank you.

216
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,770
That's our guy. Tom House.

217
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,921
Glove out front.

218
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,001
PhD in psychology-

219
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,883
Thirty years in the big leagues
as a player and a coach.

220
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,246
Don't move your head.

221
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,527
JB: Half of baseball thinks
he's absolutely crazy,

222
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,006
but you can't argue with his results.

223
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,964
Ball on wall. Glove on wall. Knee on wall.

224
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,605
If anybody can do it, he can.

225
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,523
It can't be done.

226
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,730
Cricket and baseball are two
completely different throwing motions.

227
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,211
The biomechanics,
the timing, the sequencing,

228
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,930
it's just not the same at all.

229
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,051
I mean, even if you found me
a couple of kids,

230
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,560
there's no way they'd be ready
for a pro tryout,

231
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,880
not in a year.

232
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,605
So you're saying it's impossible?

233
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,569
I'm not saying it's impossible.

234
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,764
I'm just saying it's...
It's highly improbable.

235
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,085
Why don't you consider it
a highly improbable challenge?

236
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,641
Think about it.
If it doesn't work, who cares?

237
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,767
No harm, no foul.

238
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,169
But if it does work

239
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,083
and you take two kids
from the middle of India

240
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,969
who've never picked up
a baseball in their lives

241
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,442
and turn them into
Major League prospects in one year...

242
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,040
Well, I can't think of a better plug

243
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,969
for your methods than that, can you?

244
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,968
You certainly don't need any
help with your pitching, do you?

245
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,008
AASH <i>ON PHONE: JB,
I've been through the entire list.</i>

246
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,923
I cannot find a single
Major League scout

247
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,367
that's willing to travel around India
for three months.

248
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,442
I can't be there
without a scout of some kind.

249
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,567
<i>Yeah, no kidding.</i>

250
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,251
I need someone that's gonna be there
in a month for the start of qualifiers.

251

<i>- I know that.
- Hold on. Hold on.</i>

Hi. Are you leaving?

00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,050
- Yeah, I have to go.
- Don't go.

254
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,168
I have to. Don't forget about me.

<i>AB: I will not forget about you.
I'll miss you.</i>

00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,129
Okay. Bring me something.

257
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,441
- I will bring you something.
- You better.

Yeah, well, if you saw her,
you would understand.

261
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,284

- No, I'm not sending you...

265
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,406
My washing machine's broken again.
This time I think it's dead.

266
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,489
- Why?
- Yeah, well, it's smoking.

267
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,325
Literally, from the back.
And it's making this really loud noise.

268
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,482
It's similar to ker-chug,
ker-chug, ker-chug.

269
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,488
Okay, okay, Okay-

I'm leaving for India today.

Oh, that's cool.

272
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,409
So I don't really have time
to deal with this.

273
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,450
And I also really don't
have the money right now.

274
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,403
So could you do me a favor

275
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,131
and could you,
while I'm gone, just use mine?

276
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,002
Could you throw in free detergent
and the use of your barbecue?

277
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,807
- Okay, deal.
- All right, deal. Thanks, man.

278
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,842
- You're welcome.
- Gracias.

Yes, but that is tomorrow.

No, Vivek, today.

That's why I'm standing here.

I was certain that it was tomorrow, JB sir.

- JB.
- No "sir."

- So this is our office?
- Yes, JB.

333
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,127
They are at the warehouse.

334
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,328
We are trying to get them, too.

335
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,323
Okay, but the equipment
that we sent over,

336
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,807
the batting cages, balls, bats,
that's all here?

337
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:48,044
I'm happy to confirm that
they all are here in India.

338
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,810
But you don't have them here?

339
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,883
No. They are at the customs.

340
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,605
I think we should be working on that.

341
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:01,402

What do you ask?

You would say,
"How far did you get with Ms. Brenda?"

it is impossible. Maybe you're right,

and pulling two kids out of the sticks

1705
01:37:40,280 --> 01:37:42,282
and turning them
into baseball players. So, I don't know.

Gotta go to bed.

it will ruin our relationship

the future of our investment.

I have to do this, Mr. Chang.

you do it without my support

And listen to me, guys,
no matter what happens,

I want you to know
that you could never, ever

- We should eat.
- We should. Beautiful food.

01:47:39,720 --> 01:47:42,200
Ms. Brenda, would you mind if
they joined us on our date?

1883

I wouldn't have it any other way.

1884

- Get some chairs, guys.
- No, no, no...
