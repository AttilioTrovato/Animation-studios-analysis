1
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:16,969

2
00:00:23,427 --> 00:00:27,389
Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!

3
00:00:36,482 --> 00:00:37,900
<i>When I was little girl,</i>

4
00:00:37,983 --> 00:00:40,486
<i>Christmas Eve was my favorite night
of the year.</i>

5
00:00:52,248 --> 00:00:54,542
<i>I'd wait up with my brother for Santa.</i>

6
00:00:55,167 --> 00:00:59,004
<i>Sometimes we would fall asleep,
but I'd be dreaming of presents.</i>

7
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,340
<i>I really love presents.</i>

8
00:01:08,931 --> 00:01:10,683
- Nick, he's here.
- Stop.

9
00:01:10,766 --> 00:01:12,393
Come on. Wake up.

10
00:01:12,476 --> 00:01:14,603
- No.
- Come on, come on, come on.

11
00:02:06,906 --> 00:02:09,575
What a jolly card.

12
00:02:09,658 --> 00:02:12,828
I wonder which child made this?

13
00:02:12,912 --> 00:02:15,456
Over here! Right here! I caught you.

14
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,166
You did.

15
00:02:17,249 --> 00:02:19,043
But let's keep it between us,

16
00:02:19,126 --> 00:02:22,213
because my job depends
on not getting caught.

17
00:02:22,296 --> 00:02:23,839
Totally get it.

18
00:02:23,923 --> 00:02:26,842
So, I see you have some presents...

19
00:02:26,926 --> 00:02:29,011
Oh, I do. Um...

20
00:02:29,595 --> 00:02:32,556
Have you been naughty or nice this year?

21
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,518
In my personal opinion, very nice.

22
00:02:35,601 --> 00:02:37,812
Well, let me check my list.

23
00:02:40,356 --> 00:02:41,732
Oh! Oh!

24
00:02:41,816 --> 00:02:43,859
Um, checking it twice.

25
00:02:46,028 --> 00:02:48,531
Dad!

26
00:02:48,614 --> 00:02:50,115
You know I'm nice.

27
00:02:50,574 --> 00:02:53,118
Give me a hug.

28
00:02:53,202 --> 00:02:55,162
Dad! You're home!

29
00:02:55,246 --> 00:02:56,539
Come here, my boy!

30
00:02:58,165 --> 00:03:01,126
Oh! Welcome home, Santa.

31
00:03:02,169 --> 00:03:05,756
I see Mommy kissing Santa Claus.

32
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,800
How was your night, dear?

33
00:03:07,883 --> 00:03:11,011
Jolly. The presents were all delivered.

34
00:03:11,095 --> 00:03:12,638
Except for two.

35
00:03:23,399 --> 00:03:26,360
Oh, my garland. This is amazing!

36
00:03:27,778 --> 00:03:29,029
What'd you get, Nick?

37
00:03:34,326 --> 00:03:35,369
Dad?

38
00:03:35,452 --> 00:03:40,666
Congratulations, my boy.
It's time to start your Santa training.

39
00:03:41,792 --> 00:03:43,043
Try it on.

40
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,220
I'm not sure this fits.

41
00:03:53,304 --> 00:03:56,015
It will fit you when you fit it.

42
00:04:02,021 --> 00:04:04,899
There you go. That looks jolly, Nick.

43
00:04:04,982 --> 00:04:07,151
And red is totally your color.

44
00:04:07,693 --> 00:04:09,195
Oh!

45
00:04:09,278 --> 00:04:12,156
That must be the elves
to welcome you home!

46
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,867
No, no. Wait, wait, wait.
Jackets, everyone.

47
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:18,454
Pole weather report,
snow and eight degrees.

48
00:04:18,996 --> 00:04:20,498
Forever.

49
00:04:20,581 --> 00:04:22,791
That's cold. Come on, honey.

50
00:04:24,543 --> 00:04:25,669
Thank you, Santa.

51
00:04:26,712 --> 00:04:29,507
- Merry Christmas, Polly.
- Dad?

52
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:34,261
- Uh-huh?
- I was just wondering, Mom is Mrs. Claus,

53
00:04:34,345 --> 00:04:35,721
Polly is our nanny,

54
00:04:35,804 --> 00:04:38,182
someday Nick will be Santa.

55
00:04:38,766 --> 00:04:39,892
What do I do?

56
00:04:39,975 --> 00:04:42,478
Well, what do you want to do?

57
00:04:43,187 --> 00:04:44,897
I would like to do what you do.

58
00:04:45,606 --> 00:04:47,441
You mean, be Santa?

59
00:04:47,525 --> 00:04:49,360
No, Nick is Santa.

60
00:04:49,443 --> 00:04:51,946
But I would like to help decide
what toys to make,

61
00:04:52,029 --> 00:04:54,698
and fly the sleigh,
and do something really important.

62
00:04:56,116 --> 00:04:57,451
You do, Noelle.

63
00:04:57,535 --> 00:05:01,455
You make everyone jolly with your cards
and your Christmas cheer,

64
00:05:01,539 --> 00:05:04,875
and you know how much your brother
depends on you. So you can help him,

65
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:08,546
and always keep his Christmas spirit up.

66
00:05:12,842 --> 00:05:15,845
Sure. I can do that.

67
00:05:16,428 --> 00:05:17,638
I'm counting on you.

68
00:05:20,683 --> 00:05:23,227
Merry Christmas, Noelle.

69
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:26,355
Merry Christmas, Dad.

70
00:05:28,065 --> 00:05:31,402
<i>Now that I'm grown up, Christmas
is still my favorite time of the year.</i>

71
00:05:32,111 --> 00:05:34,613
<i>Although, this Christmas is a sad one.</i>

72
00:05:35,489 --> 00:05:39,785
<i>Dad passed away five months ago,
and I miss him every day.</i>

73
00:05:42,204 --> 00:05:44,790
<i>But Dad always told us
that Christmas must go on,</i>

74
00:05:44,874 --> 00:05:46,500
<i>especially for us Kringles,</i>

75
00:05:46,584 --> 00:05:48,169
<i>because for 2,000 years,</i>

76
00:05:48,252 --> 00:05:53,215
<i>our ancestors have been the Santas that
bring joy to children all over the world.</i>

77
00:05:53,299 --> 00:05:55,092
<i>And now it's my big brother's turn,</i>

78
00:05:55,176 --> 00:05:58,345
<i>as Nick becomes the 23rd Kringle
to wear the red hat.</i>

79
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:06,103
<i>He's been practicing
his sleigh flying here in the Pole.</i>

80
00:06:06,187 --> 00:06:08,314
Am I supposed to land on the house?

81
00:06:10,566 --> 00:06:12,651
Slow down! Slow down! No, no, no!

82
00:06:17,573 --> 00:06:19,033
We can work with that, right?

83
00:06:21,494 --> 00:06:24,622
<i>Believe it or not,
that's actually an improvement.</i>

84
00:06:27,374 --> 00:06:30,211
<i>Everyone's been working super hard
to help him get ready,</i>

85
00:06:31,587 --> 00:06:34,131
- <i>including Mother.</i>
- Well, dear, that was, um...

86
00:06:34,215 --> 00:06:35,591
Well, you know.

87
00:06:35,674 --> 00:06:37,927
<i>And Santa's Helpers are singing...</i>

88
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:39,678
<i>Crashing all the way
Ha, ha, ha!</i>

89
00:06:39,762 --> 00:06:43,265
<i>My geeky cousin, Gabe,
and his Tech Elves are doing something.</i>

90
00:06:43,349 --> 00:06:44,350
<i>I don't know.</i>

91
00:06:44,433 --> 00:06:47,394
- <i>They're really excited about it.</i>
- Oh, my God! We did it!

92
00:06:48,103 --> 00:06:51,690
<i>And as for me, I'm still making
my cards and spreading Christmas cheer,</i>

93
00:06:51,774 --> 00:06:53,442
<i>just like Dad told me to.</i>

94
00:06:53,526 --> 00:06:56,821
<i>I don't know what everyone
would do without me.</i>

95
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:25,975
Yo! Snowcone! Dude!

96
00:07:29,645 --> 00:07:30,646
Oh!

97
00:07:30,729 --> 00:07:34,567
Yes, who's my hyperactive little reindeer?
You are! Oh! You got it.

98
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:37,611
What do we think?

99
00:07:38,612 --> 00:07:42,241
"Merry Christmas.
What are you getting this year?"

100
00:07:44,368 --> 00:07:48,747
I know, it totally captures the essence
of Christmas, getting the perfect present.

101
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,626
- Noelle!
- Mmm.

102
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,088
Morning, princess.

103
00:07:56,172 --> 00:07:57,882
Thank you, but I don't want breakfast.

104
00:07:57,965 --> 00:07:59,383
- Yes, you do.
- I'm very busy.

105
00:07:59,466 --> 00:08:04,221
I have been out in the forest,
chopping firewood, carting it on my back,

106
00:08:04,305 --> 00:08:07,391
so that I could heat up the cottage
and make your breakfast waffles,

107
00:08:07,474 --> 00:08:11,061
while I picked up all the dirty clothes,
but none of that's really been a problem.

108
00:08:12,271 --> 00:08:14,857
I don't need you to do
any of that stuff. Honestly.

109
00:08:15,441 --> 00:08:17,902
You would starve and die
if it weren't for me.

110
00:08:17,985 --> 00:08:20,863
That's what you think.
Oh, my garland. This is delicious.

111
00:08:22,323 --> 00:08:24,492
Oh, my partridge-in-a-pear-tree underwear
needs washing.

112
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:27,328
Oh, well, then my Christmas wish
has been granted.

113
00:08:35,503 --> 00:08:36,504
Hmm.

114
00:08:44,261 --> 00:08:46,013
Come on, Snowy. I'll race you.

115
00:08:46,472 --> 00:08:47,473
Whoo!

116
00:09:04,406 --> 00:09:06,617
Puffins, scatter!

117
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,827
Sorry, guys!

118
00:09:22,591 --> 00:09:25,219
Noelle! Elf Carol. <i>Daily Carol.</i>

119
00:09:25,302 --> 00:09:28,305
- Can I ask you a few questions?
- I'm all earmuffs. Fire away.

120
00:09:28,889 --> 00:09:31,725
We know it's been a whirlwind preparation
since your father,

121
00:09:31,809 --> 00:09:34,812
and our dearly beloved Santa Nicholas,
passed away.

122
00:09:34,895 --> 00:09:36,272
How is your brother doing?

123
00:09:36,355 --> 00:09:38,649
So jolly. We're all very proud of him.

124
00:09:38,732 --> 00:09:42,278
And the big question is:
will he be ready by Christmas?

125
00:09:42,361 --> 00:09:44,488
Of course! He's a Kringle.

126
00:09:45,114 --> 00:09:46,657
- Under. Under.
- Ah! Okay.

127
00:09:47,241 --> 00:09:50,161
Under your tongue.
All right. There you go. Ooh!

128
00:09:50,744 --> 00:09:53,706
Santa, I got you a new scarf.

129
00:09:53,789 --> 00:09:56,458
And check this out.
<i>Three Weeks To A Jelly Belly...</i>

130
00:09:56,542 --> 00:09:58,043
What happened? Mother!

131
00:09:58,127 --> 00:09:59,128
Santa, I thought

132
00:09:59,211 --> 00:10:00,880
you were at sleigh practice.

133
00:10:01,297 --> 00:10:03,507
<i>Santa tried to land again</i>

134
00:10:03,591 --> 00:10:05,801
<i>Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la</i>

135
00:10:05,885 --> 00:10:08,554
<i>He missed the roof and hit the den</i>

136
00:10:08,637 --> 00:10:10,931
<i>Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la</i>

137
00:10:11,015 --> 00:10:13,184
Thank you, Santa's Helpers.

138
00:10:13,267 --> 00:10:16,479
It was a horrible example of what can
go wrong when you're using, well,

139
00:10:16,562 --> 00:10:18,022
outdated technology.

140
00:10:18,105 --> 00:10:20,357
- After Cousin Nick crashed, the...
- Oh!

141
00:10:20,441 --> 00:10:23,235
I'm sorry. Did you just refer to him
as Cousin Nick?

142
00:10:23,819 --> 00:10:26,113
Shouldn't you be
calling my big brother "Santa"?

143
00:10:26,197 --> 00:10:29,575
Oh, I'm sorry. I just thought
that since we were all family, that...

144
00:10:29,658 --> 00:10:32,453
Well, he's Santa to you,
he's Santa to everyone.

145
00:10:32,536 --> 00:10:34,038
He's even Santa to himself.

146
00:10:34,121 --> 00:10:36,624
Well, actually, I'm pretty informal
when I'm alone.

147
00:10:36,707 --> 00:10:38,042
I'm just Nick.

148
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,670
Alone. That's a jolly idea.

149
00:10:41,754 --> 00:10:45,758
Why don't we all just give Santa a moment.

150
00:10:48,427 --> 00:10:49,637
Okay.

151
00:10:50,304 --> 00:10:51,388
Excuse me, Gabe.

152
00:10:53,474 --> 00:10:56,977
This is not going well at all, dear.

153
00:10:58,062 --> 00:10:59,980
Dasher nearly broke an antler.

154
00:11:00,064 --> 00:11:04,485
And we're way, way behind schedule
at the workshop.

155
00:11:04,568 --> 00:11:07,947
You need to do your job and give
your brother some Christmas spirit,

156
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:10,741
or else we're not gonna be ready
for Christmas.

157
00:11:16,205 --> 00:11:17,498
Oh, this is heavy.

158
00:11:18,123 --> 00:11:20,668
<i>The Book of Santa.</i>
I've read it. I've memorized it.

159
00:11:20,751 --> 00:11:23,212
I've listened to it on tape.
I just don't get it.

160
00:11:23,295 --> 00:11:26,966
Okay. Well, we are gonna read it together
and we're gonna figure this out.

161
00:11:27,508 --> 00:11:28,717
Let's start at the top.

162
00:11:28,801 --> 00:11:31,971
The top is chimney access,
that's funny.

163
00:11:32,054 --> 00:11:36,141
"The chimney will expand when you tap
three times with the magical candy cane

164
00:11:36,225 --> 00:11:38,644
"and sing the first line
of <i>We Wish You A Merry Christmas,</i>

165
00:11:38,727 --> 00:11:40,312
"assuming that you stay in key."

166
00:11:40,396 --> 00:11:41,772
- Hold your reindeer.
- Yeah.

167
00:11:41,856 --> 00:11:46,610
How am I supposed to know which is
the right present to give each child?

168
00:11:46,694 --> 00:11:48,988
If I haven't determined
who's naughty or nice,

169
00:11:49,071 --> 00:11:50,614
how can I pick their present?

170
00:11:51,448 --> 00:11:53,409
You see, it's kind of a vicious circle.

171
00:11:54,869 --> 00:11:55,870
Okay.

172
00:11:55,953 --> 00:11:59,498
This is the list. It's filled with names.
Some are nice and some are naughty.

173
00:11:59,582 --> 00:12:01,500
Some of the names
haven't been filled in yet,

174
00:12:01,584 --> 00:12:03,460
and that's gonna be your job, okay?

175
00:12:03,544 --> 00:12:06,088
Dad said, "It's not about
what the kid looks like.

176
00:12:06,172 --> 00:12:07,965
"It's what's on the inside
that's important.

177
00:12:08,048 --> 00:12:09,800
"You need to connect with their heart."

178
00:12:10,384 --> 00:12:13,304
Oh, I love that.
How's that done?

179
00:12:13,387 --> 00:12:15,806
I have no idea.
Just focus really hard, I guess?

180
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:17,766
Okay.

181
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:20,269
Uh... Nice.

182
00:12:20,853 --> 00:12:23,355
She cheated on every math test
she ever took.

183
00:12:25,232 --> 00:12:28,152
That's a... stocking full of coal
if ever I've seen one.

184
00:12:28,235 --> 00:12:30,112
Yeah. He saved a kitten from a tree,

185
00:12:30,196 --> 00:12:32,823
after visiting his grandmother
in the nursing home.

186
00:12:32,907 --> 00:12:34,200
So, nice?

187
00:12:34,783 --> 00:12:38,078
Okay, we need to figure out what people
want for Christmas. Here we go.

188
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:42,208
- Football tickets.
- iPad.

189
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:44,877
Really think about this next one.
Take your time.

190
00:12:46,545 --> 00:12:48,547
She looks like
she likes playing guitar,

191
00:12:49,131 --> 00:12:51,175
and that looks like, uh, an old guitar.

192
00:12:51,258 --> 00:12:52,760
So, I'm gonna say, um...

193
00:12:56,138 --> 00:12:58,349
- New guitar?
- iPad.

194
00:13:00,017 --> 00:13:01,185
You can do this.

195
00:13:01,268 --> 00:13:02,978
- iPad?
- Polly!

196
00:13:03,062 --> 00:13:05,439
- Okay, let's say I'm in Germany.
- Yeah.

197
00:13:05,523 --> 00:13:08,526
A child wakes up, wants to talk to me,
I don't speak their language.

198
00:13:08,609 --> 00:13:11,570
Yeah, but, um,
Santa understands all languages.

199
00:13:11,654 --> 00:13:14,740
And so do you.
I saw you speaking Arabic to Elf Tippy.

200
00:13:14,824 --> 00:13:16,867
Yeah, but that's because Gabe showed me

201
00:13:16,951 --> 00:13:19,411
how to use this thing
called Google Translate.

202
00:13:22,081 --> 00:13:25,334
Okay, Nick, I know
you're scared of the reindeer,

203
00:13:25,417 --> 00:13:28,796
but you need to Santa up.
You've gotta show them who's boss.

204
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:31,924
"Grip the reins with both hands
while firmly saying 'On Dasher!'"

205
00:13:36,512 --> 00:13:38,597
Grip, command.

206
00:13:38,681 --> 00:13:40,516
Can't treat them like your cuddly pets.

207
00:13:40,599 --> 00:13:42,434
You're almost in.
Look how good you're doing!

208
00:13:42,518 --> 00:13:43,686
I don't wanna do this. No!

209
00:13:43,769 --> 00:13:45,688
- This is great! Let it happen!
- No!

210
00:13:45,771 --> 00:13:48,983
No!

211
00:13:49,066 --> 00:13:51,318
Great job, buddy. That looked great.

212
00:13:51,402 --> 00:13:52,987
- You okay?
- No!

213
00:13:55,739 --> 00:13:57,950
Ugh.

214
00:14:01,203 --> 00:14:02,496
All right.

215
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:06,125
- Two double hot chocolates.
- Great.

216
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:08,711
One with extra whipped cream.

217
00:14:11,005 --> 00:14:13,382
And... peppermint.

218
00:14:14,884 --> 00:14:17,553
Thank garland for hot chocolate
and peppermint.

219
00:14:18,262 --> 00:14:19,722
Mmm.

220
00:14:20,556 --> 00:14:23,642
I feel like I've been shivering
my whole life, you know?

221
00:14:24,351 --> 00:14:28,105
Sometimes, I... I dream about getting out
and finding someplace warm,

222
00:14:28,189 --> 00:14:31,442
where I can stretch and relax
and just breathe, you know?

223
00:14:31,525 --> 00:14:33,235
- Then you should.
- How?

224
00:14:33,819 --> 00:14:37,406
I'm Santa. I don't get a vacation.
I don't even get Christmas off.

225
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:39,992
You can't be Santa
if you're having a nervous breakdown.

226
00:14:40,075 --> 00:14:42,912
Nobody wants you sliding into
their fireplace crying and weeping.

227
00:14:42,995 --> 00:14:44,163
Nothing merry about that.

228
00:14:44,246 --> 00:14:46,373
Can't go down chimneys.
I'm claustrophobic.

229
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:49,502
You remember those magazines
Dad used to bring me on Christmas?

230
00:14:49,585 --> 00:14:52,379
Yeah, like <i>People?</i> That's how I found out
Jennifer Aniston's nice.

231
00:14:52,463 --> 00:14:55,633
Yeah.
<i>Travel And Leisure</i> had those sections

232
00:14:55,716 --> 00:14:57,343
about the perfect Christmas getaway.

233
00:14:57,426 --> 00:14:59,970
Warm weather, swimming pools,
sun-kissed mountains.

234
00:15:00,596 --> 00:15:05,017
You need to look in that magazine,
pick a place, get away for the weekend.

235
00:15:05,643 --> 00:15:07,728
Bring me back some issues
while you're down there.

236
00:15:16,487 --> 00:15:18,614
Ah! Cousin Gabe.

237
00:15:19,824 --> 00:15:20,825
Hello.

238
00:15:21,408 --> 00:15:24,495
I wanted to install GPS
and USB-C portals on the sleigh,

239
00:15:24,578 --> 00:15:28,582
and was wondering if you knew
where Cousin... Santa, you know, was.

240
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:32,336
I think he probably took the sleigh
for a practice flight.

241
00:15:32,878 --> 00:15:36,173
Well, the sleigh came back,
and all the reindeer are here,

242
00:15:36,715 --> 00:15:38,050
but there's no Santa.

243
00:15:40,177 --> 00:15:44,181
Well, it's not like him to just leave.

244
00:15:44,265 --> 00:15:46,475
What's with all these magazines?

245
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:51,230
<i>"InStyle, Travel and Leisure,
Martha Stewart's Living."</i>

246
00:15:53,607 --> 00:15:56,110
Um, I was helping Santa train,

247
00:15:56,193 --> 00:15:59,405
and he seemed a little overwhelmed.
So I mentioned, almost as a joke...

248
00:15:59,488 --> 00:16:01,073
Ho, ho, ho.

249
00:16:01,157 --> 00:16:03,576
That he should go somewhere
and relax for the weekend.

250
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:07,997
And maybe bring back some new magazines.
That's probably what that's about.

251
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,915
But they're for all of us to enjoy.

252
00:16:10,624 --> 00:16:11,709
It's not just for me.

253
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:16,463
But you guys seem mad.

254
00:16:16,547 --> 00:16:19,341
I hope he's okay!

255
00:16:20,134 --> 00:16:21,135
Where is he?

256
00:16:23,846 --> 00:16:25,347
When was the last time you saw him?

257
00:16:25,431 --> 00:16:26,724
Seven days and counting.

258
00:16:28,434 --> 00:16:29,518
It's Noelle's fault.

259
00:16:29,602 --> 00:16:31,270
What's gonna happen with Christmas?

260
00:16:31,353 --> 00:16:33,481
- I hope it's okay.
- What happened to him?

261
00:16:33,564 --> 00:16:35,316
This never happened before.

262
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:37,318
- Quiet.
- Where is he?

263
00:16:38,736 --> 00:16:41,197
Quiet!

264
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:44,116
Silent night.

265
00:16:49,246 --> 00:16:51,999
For the first time in 2,000 years,

266
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:55,211
a Santa has disappeared.

267
00:16:55,294 --> 00:16:57,129
At the urging of his sister, Noelle.

268
00:16:57,213 --> 00:16:58,964
I just said he should take
the weekend off.

269
00:16:59,048 --> 00:17:01,550
You put Christmas in jeopardy, young lady.

270
00:17:01,634 --> 00:17:03,802
- She did.
- That's so naughty.

271
00:17:04,386 --> 00:17:06,347
Rest ye, merry gentlemen.

272
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:11,602
As Christmas is just six days away,
we must have a new Santa.

273
00:17:11,685 --> 00:17:14,438
Wait. What about a rescue mission?

274
00:17:14,522 --> 00:17:17,817
My brother could be hurt.
He might've fallen out of the sleigh.

275
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,902
No one but Santa has ever left the Pole.

276
00:17:19,985 --> 00:17:22,112
And we have no idea where Santa is.

277
00:17:22,196 --> 00:17:25,366
We could lose the sleigh or the reindeer.
Then there'd be no Christmas.

278
00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:29,119
- No Christmas?
- A rescue attempt is far too dangerous.

279
00:17:30,204 --> 00:17:33,916
Leaving me no choice but to call upon...

280
00:17:35,042 --> 00:17:36,210
Gabriel Kringle.

281
00:17:36,293 --> 00:17:38,128
- Gabriel?
- Me?

282
00:17:38,212 --> 00:17:39,964
Please, approach the council.

283
00:17:40,714 --> 00:17:44,051
But I'm in the Tech department.
And loving it.

284
00:17:44,134 --> 00:17:45,594
Nevertheless, you must approach

285
00:17:45,678 --> 00:17:48,389
because we must select
the next adult male Kringle

286
00:17:48,472 --> 00:17:50,224
as specified by the Christmas covenant.

287
00:17:50,307 --> 00:17:52,852
That's not exactly what it says...

288
00:17:52,935 --> 00:17:54,186
They're elder elves.

289
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,689
- They know what they're talking about.
- Please.

290
00:18:08,784 --> 00:18:09,785
Gabe.

291
00:18:10,911 --> 00:18:16,792
By order of the council,
the pom-pom now rests upon your head.

292
00:18:17,751 --> 00:18:19,420
- Really?
- Seriously?

293
00:18:19,503 --> 00:18:21,297
I don't know about this guy.

294
00:18:34,477 --> 00:18:36,854
Noelle, why did you
tell your brother to leave?

295
00:18:36,937 --> 00:18:38,564
I thought he would come back.

296
00:18:38,647 --> 00:18:41,233
You didn't think about
how he listens to you,

297
00:18:41,317 --> 00:18:46,280
and how your advice affected Christmas
and all of the children in the world.

298
00:18:46,363 --> 00:18:48,199
I just said, "Take the weekend."

299
00:18:48,282 --> 00:18:50,951
- She had one job.
- To look after her brother.

300
00:18:51,035 --> 00:18:54,038
What a princess.

301
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:57,917
I just said, go for the weekend.

302
00:19:15,935 --> 00:19:18,938
Oh, Serge, hot chocolate,
double whip cream, and peppermint,

303
00:19:19,021 --> 00:19:20,189
in honor of my brother?

304
00:19:20,856 --> 00:19:25,069
We're all booked up.
Maybe try back in... July.

305
00:19:26,362 --> 00:19:28,239
Oh, okay.

306
00:19:32,284 --> 00:19:35,788
It can't possibly be that much.
What about my Kringle discount?

307
00:19:36,372 --> 00:19:39,375
That's only for Santa's immediate family,
not cousins.

308
00:20:01,856 --> 00:20:03,399
I want it shut.

309
00:20:03,482 --> 00:20:07,945
It's been shut, which is why
this room smells like old stockings.

310
00:20:08,445 --> 00:20:09,697
Uh...

311
00:20:10,281 --> 00:20:15,411
Mother's furious, and everybody hates me
because I've ruined Christmas.

312
00:20:15,494 --> 00:20:17,538
And I don't know if my brother's okay.

313
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:19,582
What do you want from me?

314
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:22,793
Stockings, sheets, and pillow cases.

315
00:20:22,877 --> 00:20:24,211
Ho, ho... Ow!

316
00:20:25,504 --> 00:20:28,007
Princess, for once in your life,

317
00:20:28,591 --> 00:20:30,384
try cleaning up your own mess.

318
00:20:30,467 --> 00:20:31,927
How do you suggest I do that?

319
00:20:34,763 --> 00:20:38,100
"Take a journey to a better you."

320
00:20:38,893 --> 00:20:41,437
Ugh. Glitter all over the floor.

321
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,814
And stop eating waffles in bed.

322
00:20:55,451 --> 00:20:57,161
Hot chocolate and peppermint.

323
00:20:58,412 --> 00:20:59,622
Nick.

324
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:06,086
Maui and San Juan.
What's between Maui and San Juan?

325
00:21:11,383 --> 00:21:12,635
"Phoenix."

326
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:15,846
Phoenix, Arizona.

327
00:21:34,698 --> 00:21:37,910
Princess, do you mind telling me
what you're doing?

328
00:21:38,744 --> 00:21:41,455
I'm going to get my brother,
and you're coming with me.

329
00:21:42,832 --> 00:21:44,708
No, I'm not.

330
00:21:45,292 --> 00:21:49,505
Your mother will not be jolly with this,
and it is my job to keep you safe.

331
00:21:49,588 --> 00:21:51,298
I left her a card explaining everything,

332
00:21:51,382 --> 00:21:54,301
and you can't keep me safe
if you're here and I'm in Phoenix.

333
00:21:54,385 --> 00:21:57,096
Phoenix? That sounds horrible.

334
00:22:00,516 --> 00:22:02,017
Oh, hey, little guy.

335
00:22:02,101 --> 00:22:03,936
Uh, I've gotta go away.

336
00:22:06,438 --> 00:22:09,024
I know you wanna be on the team,
you're just not ready yet.

337
00:22:09,108 --> 00:22:10,609
So keep practicing, okay?

338
00:22:13,237 --> 00:22:15,072
Okay.

339
00:22:18,284 --> 00:22:20,619
Yes, I know. I'm going to get him.

340
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:23,831
- Princess, get out of here.
- No.

341
00:22:23,914 --> 00:22:26,542
Listen, you've never been
out of the North Pole.

342
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:29,211
- Polly.
- You do not know how to fly this sleigh.

343
00:22:29,295 --> 00:22:31,130
Fine. Then it'll all be on Dasher.

344
00:22:57,948 --> 00:22:59,241
Turn this thing around.

345
00:22:59,325 --> 00:23:02,828
No. Not going back without my brother.
And it's your job to help me.

346
00:23:05,581 --> 00:23:07,458
<i>Destination, Phoenix, Arizona.</i>

347
00:24:16,944 --> 00:24:20,072
I guess this is their village.
Where is everybody?

348
00:24:22,324 --> 00:24:25,161
- What do you think you doin'?
- Hi. I'm Noelle.

349
00:24:25,244 --> 00:24:26,662
Stay right where you are.

350
00:24:27,246 --> 00:24:29,081
We are looking for Santa Claus.

351
00:24:30,457 --> 00:24:32,084
<i>You've got presents.</i>

352
00:24:32,626 --> 00:24:34,503
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>

353
00:24:34,587 --> 00:24:35,796
Feliz Navidad!

354
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:41,093
How are you planning on having Christmas
without the reindeer and the sleigh?

355
00:24:41,177 --> 00:24:43,053
- Noelle took the reindeer?
- Mmm-hmm.

356
00:24:43,137 --> 00:24:44,889
- And the sleigh?
- Mmm-hmm.

357
00:24:45,806 --> 00:24:46,807
Huh...

358
00:24:47,391 --> 00:24:48,976
That's so interesting.

359
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:53,522
What if not having the sleigh
or the reindeer is a blessing in disguise?

360
00:24:53,606 --> 00:24:54,690
I don't think so.

361
00:24:54,773 --> 00:24:58,903
This could be the perfect time
to start an online delivery platform.

362
00:24:58,986 --> 00:25:01,947
- I don't think so.
- What if the reindeer have Lyme disease?

363
00:25:02,031 --> 00:25:04,200
What if an asteroid
crashes into the sleigh?

364
00:25:04,283 --> 00:25:06,577
These are real concerns,
statistically speaking,

365
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,412
and I think our customers deserve better.

366
00:25:08,496 --> 00:25:11,624
We don't have customers.

367
00:25:11,707 --> 00:25:18,130
We have children who need the magic
of a Santa coming down the chimney

368
00:25:18,214 --> 00:25:23,511
and arranging each present
with love and care under the tree.

369
00:25:24,094 --> 00:25:25,804
Okay, well, now you sound
like a crazy person.

370
00:25:26,388 --> 00:25:32,144
Gabe, aren't you even worried about
your cousins, Nick and Noelle, and Polly?

371
00:25:32,228 --> 00:25:35,314
Who knows what terrible things
have happened to them?

372
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,160
Uh, hi, thank you, yes, I...
My name is Helen Rojas,

373
00:25:48,244 --> 00:25:50,204
I'm the manager
of the Desert Ridge Marketplace.

374
00:25:50,287 --> 00:25:51,872
- Oh, it's nice to meet you.
- Yes.

375
00:25:51,956 --> 00:25:55,751
Uh, you cannot perform or solicit here
on these grounds without a permit.

376
00:25:55,835 --> 00:25:58,337
Can you stop, please? Or I will have to
have you arrested.

377
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,547
Can you... This is my desk.

378
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:01,799
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Thank you, thank you.

379
00:26:01,882 --> 00:26:02,883
- Here, I have a...
- Oh!

380
00:26:02,967 --> 00:26:04,468
Yes, thank you. Mmm-hmm.

381
00:26:05,052 --> 00:26:07,596
Okay, now, uh...

382
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,431
Where were we? Um, arrested.

383
00:26:09,515 --> 00:26:12,434
Okay, that sounds bad, but can you
just tell me, have you seen this man?

384
00:26:13,352 --> 00:26:14,395
- Santa?
- Yeah.

385
00:26:14,478 --> 00:26:16,564
He looks nice and polite,
so I haven't dated him.

386
00:26:16,647 --> 00:26:17,648
Listen, miss,

387
00:26:17,731 --> 00:26:21,402
this isn't the first time someone's tried
this kind of promotional stunt.

388
00:26:21,485 --> 00:26:24,363
About two months ago, we had a guy
with a sleigh and a reindeer

389
00:26:24,446 --> 00:26:26,991
- show up outside of Chase Field...
- That's him!

390
00:26:27,074 --> 00:26:28,993
That's who I'm looking for.
Where did he go?

391
00:26:29,076 --> 00:26:30,077
The North Pole.

392
00:26:30,161 --> 00:26:33,205
Now, vacate the premises
or I'll have to call the police...

393
00:26:33,289 --> 00:26:34,707
- Hey, Helen.
- Oh, yes.

394
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:37,418
Was it your idea to bring that sleigh
and reindeer in here?

395
00:26:37,501 --> 00:26:39,503
Uh, yes, Dan. I'm dealing with it...

396
00:26:39,587 --> 00:26:42,715
People are rushing into my Petco
trying to find reindeer food.

397
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:45,009
We don't have any,
so I just relabeled the birdseed.

398
00:26:45,092 --> 00:26:46,594
They love birdseed.

399
00:26:46,677 --> 00:26:48,762
This is going to be
our best Christmas yet.

400
00:26:48,846 --> 00:26:50,139
You'll probably get a raise.

401
00:26:50,222 --> 00:26:52,308
You might finally get to
take that trip to Hawaii.

402
00:26:53,058 --> 00:26:55,519
Gosh, I'd love to go myself one day.

403
00:27:00,774 --> 00:27:02,193
I've never tried this before,

404
00:27:02,276 --> 00:27:04,236
so I don't know
if I'm gonna do it right, but...

405
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,197
Ooh.

406
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:09,074
Can you not do that, please? Thank you.

407
00:27:09,158 --> 00:27:10,576
Did I do it wrong?

408
00:27:10,659 --> 00:27:14,246
This release form protects
Desert Ridge Marketplace

409
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:17,583
from any liabilities
as a result of your presence.

410
00:27:20,294 --> 00:27:21,670
Thank you.

411
00:27:21,754 --> 00:27:24,507
Oh, Helen, which way is Phoenix?

412
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:28,427
Okay. Let's go find my brother.

413
00:27:28,511 --> 00:27:29,637
Hold on.

414
00:27:30,262 --> 00:27:33,432
Someone has to stay
and keep an eye on Dasher and company.

415
00:27:33,516 --> 00:27:37,186
They're used to a strict regimen
of North Pole hay and training.

416
00:27:37,269 --> 00:27:40,731
So, who knows what will happen
when they're faced with temptation?

417
00:27:41,398 --> 00:27:44,026
So, you want me to go out there alone?

418
00:27:44,109 --> 00:27:47,822
Noelle, you go out there and you be merry,

419
00:27:48,489 --> 00:27:53,077
and you don't tell anybody who you are
or where you came from.

420
00:27:53,619 --> 00:27:56,539
And always be ready to run away.

421
00:28:18,602 --> 00:28:21,147
- I hate you.
- No! I am done talking with you about...

422
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:25,401
Every frickin' time. I'm gonna lose it.

423
00:28:26,485 --> 00:28:27,486
Oh!

424
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,488
Thank you.

425
00:28:30,239 --> 00:28:32,074
Ah! Mmm!

426
00:28:35,578 --> 00:28:37,329
There's something wrong with that.

427
00:28:38,372 --> 00:28:40,833
Don't drink that. That's awful.

428
00:28:57,433 --> 00:28:58,434
Nick?

429
00:28:59,727 --> 00:29:01,228
Nick.

430
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:09,278
Fifty percent off everything.
More you buy, the merrier you are.

431
00:29:09,361 --> 00:29:12,281
Sir, it's a privilege to wear that suit.

432
00:29:12,865 --> 00:29:13,949
Put some pants on.

433
00:29:17,411 --> 00:29:18,829
So naughty.

434
00:29:23,834 --> 00:29:25,503
<i>Have you seen this man?</i>

435
00:29:25,586 --> 00:29:26,879
Mmm-mmm.

436
00:29:27,463 --> 00:29:28,839
Definitely not one of ours.

437
00:29:29,423 --> 00:29:31,425
Cheap suit, no one's gonna believe that.

438
00:29:39,475 --> 00:29:41,393
Sorry I'm late, dude.
Forgot my pants.

439
00:29:56,617 --> 00:30:00,538
You know, Mr. Ortega, I think it's better
you know the truth about your brother

440
00:30:00,621 --> 00:30:03,249
stealing all of your money
than to live in a fantasy.

441
00:30:04,208 --> 00:30:05,626
I disagree.

442
00:30:10,923 --> 00:30:11,966
Um...

443
00:30:12,049 --> 00:30:15,177
Merry Christmas. Noelle Kringle. Jake?

444
00:30:15,261 --> 00:30:16,846
Saw your name on the sign.

445
00:30:16,929 --> 00:30:18,931
Why are you so red?

446
00:30:19,515 --> 00:30:22,601
And why are you wearing a winter hat
and mittens in Phoenix?

447
00:30:22,685 --> 00:30:23,978
Because it's an ensemble.

448
00:30:24,728 --> 00:30:26,730
But I'm here
'cause I'm looking for my brother.

449
00:30:26,814 --> 00:30:28,941
I'm worried something
might have happened to him.

450
00:30:29,024 --> 00:30:30,109
Like what?

451
00:30:31,652 --> 00:30:35,823
Well, my father ran a business,

452
00:30:35,906 --> 00:30:38,325
and after he passed,
my brother was supposed to take over,

453
00:30:38,409 --> 00:30:39,869
but he left and came to Phoenix,

454
00:30:39,952 --> 00:30:43,455
'cause he said he needed to breathe
and stretch and relax.

455
00:30:43,539 --> 00:30:45,499
But we have to find him because I know,

456
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,627
in his heart, he wants to
run the family business.

457
00:30:48,711 --> 00:30:51,589
I find most people, they don't know
what's in their own hearts.

458
00:30:51,672 --> 00:30:52,882
Let alone anyone else's.

459
00:30:52,965 --> 00:30:56,051
That's if they even have a heart
in the first place.

460
00:30:56,552 --> 00:30:57,553
Oh!

461
00:30:57,636 --> 00:30:59,597
That's pretty stocking half empty.

462
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,515
Yeah, well, I'm a private detective.

463
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:03,392
You get "stocking half empty"
pretty quick.

464
00:31:03,476 --> 00:31:07,980
- Do you have a picture of this brother?
- Yes. His name is Nick Kringle.

465
00:31:08,063 --> 00:31:09,773
- Nick Kringle?
- Mmm-hmm.

466
00:31:10,691 --> 00:31:12,485
- You're Noelle Kringle?
- That's me.

467
00:31:13,068 --> 00:31:15,946
- You're pretty deep into Christmas.
- Best day of the year, right?

468
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:18,699
Yeah, well, it's definitely
a day of the year.

469
00:31:18,782 --> 00:31:21,911
I'm on the way out, but I'll see
what I can do for $150 a day.

470
00:31:22,578 --> 00:31:25,789
Money, yes. You cannot put a price
on what this is worth to me.

471
00:31:27,291 --> 00:31:28,334
- Up front.
- Okay.

472
00:31:34,757 --> 00:31:36,091
"In Santa We Trust"?

473
00:31:36,175 --> 00:31:39,803
That's real gold on the outside.
And chocolate in the middle.

474
00:31:39,887 --> 00:31:43,307
Look, lady, um, with all due respect...

475
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:46,101
Get some sunblock fast.

476
00:31:49,688 --> 00:31:50,940
Uh...

477
00:31:51,023 --> 00:31:54,151
- Jake, you don't understand, see...
- My phone died. Can I borrow yours?

478
00:31:54,235 --> 00:31:55,611
I don't have a phone.

479
00:31:55,694 --> 00:31:58,489
Oh, of course, probably hard to dial
with mittens on.

480
00:31:58,572 --> 00:32:01,408
Only get two days with him before
Christmas, and now I'm late.

481
00:32:01,492 --> 00:32:02,910
- With who?
- My son, my boy,

482
00:32:02,993 --> 00:32:04,870
I'm supposed to take him
to a basketball game

483
00:32:04,954 --> 00:32:06,747
and now my ex-wife's...

484
00:32:06,831 --> 00:32:09,416
Let's find you a phone.
I'm sure somebody will let us...

485
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,919
No, people don't just let people
borrow phones.

486
00:32:12,002 --> 00:32:13,796
- It doesn't work that way.
- It's Christmas.

487
00:32:13,879 --> 00:32:15,381
Oh, I forgot it's Christmas.

488
00:32:15,464 --> 00:32:18,634
Okay, excuse me, ma'am,
may I please borrow your phone?

489
00:32:18,717 --> 00:32:20,010
Like I want your germs.

490
00:32:20,928 --> 00:32:22,388
- Okay.
- See what I mean?

491
00:32:22,471 --> 00:32:24,890
Excuse me, sir,
may I please borrow your...

492
00:32:24,974 --> 00:32:25,975
Um...

493
00:32:26,392 --> 00:32:28,602
See what I mean? Kringle?

494
00:32:30,312 --> 00:32:31,313
Kringle?

495
00:32:34,233 --> 00:32:35,234
Kringle?

496
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:40,531
Ask him.

497
00:32:41,157 --> 00:32:43,284
- Who?
- That man, he's nice.

498
00:32:43,367 --> 00:32:44,827
- He's nice?
- Yeah.

499
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:45,911
How do you know?

500
00:32:46,912 --> 00:32:48,539
I don't know, I just know.

501
00:32:49,415 --> 00:32:50,416
Excuse me.

502
00:32:52,501 --> 00:32:54,211
- Sir, hi.
- Hi.

503
00:32:54,295 --> 00:32:56,714
My friend has an important call
to make, his phone died.

504
00:32:56,797 --> 00:32:58,591
Is there any way he could borrow yours?

505
00:32:59,175 --> 00:33:00,843
Sure, no problem.

506
00:33:01,844 --> 00:33:02,970
Oh.

507
00:33:04,096 --> 00:33:05,639
- Oh, thanks.
- It's okay.

508
00:33:05,723 --> 00:33:07,308
- Thanks a lot.
- No problem.

509
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:12,438
Noelle Kringle. I hope you get
what you want for Christmas.

510
00:33:12,521 --> 00:33:15,357
- Matt Bautista. I'm actually a Buddhist.
- Oh, jolly!

511
00:33:15,441 --> 00:33:17,526
My dad always said,
"Christmas is like sushi,

512
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:19,862
"the Japanese invented it,
but now everybody loves it."

513
00:33:20,696 --> 00:33:22,031
Well, I do love sushi.

514
00:33:23,782 --> 00:33:25,367
Thank you, I really appreciate that.

515
00:33:25,451 --> 00:33:27,661
My pleasure. You guys have a great day.

516
00:33:27,745 --> 00:33:29,079
- Bye, Matt.
- Bye.

517
00:33:30,372 --> 00:33:33,209
Thank you, Kringle. Uh, I gotta run.

518
00:33:39,298 --> 00:33:41,175
Give me that picture of your brother.

519
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:46,013
Come by the office tomorrow at 9:00.
Bring non-edible money.

520
00:33:46,096 --> 00:33:48,265
Do they make that?
I'm kidding. I know they do.

521
00:33:48,349 --> 00:33:50,768
And I'll find some. I will bring some.

522
00:33:50,851 --> 00:33:53,270
Thank you for helping me,
you're being so nice.

523
00:33:53,896 --> 00:33:55,356
It's a big day for nice.

524
00:33:56,398 --> 00:33:58,692
Yeah. Big day for nice.

525
00:34:01,654 --> 00:34:05,574
<i>Merry Christmas,
Elf-folk, it's Santa. Santa Gabe.</i>

526
00:34:06,283 --> 00:34:09,245
<i>As you may know, my cousin Nick,
the ex-Santa,</i>

527
00:34:09,328 --> 00:34:12,706
<i>never completed the Nice or Naughty list,
but that's jolly.</i>

528
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:14,834
<i>Because it allowed us to develop...</i>

529
00:34:14,917 --> 00:34:16,252
<i>FALALA.</i>

530
00:34:16,335 --> 00:34:20,589
<i>Forensic Algorithm for Lateral Analysis
of Latent Altruism.</i>

531
00:34:20,673 --> 00:34:22,091
<i>It's a digitized metric</i>

532
00:34:22,174 --> 00:34:25,344
<i>which allows us to determine
a child's Nice or Naughty quotient.</i>

533
00:34:25,427 --> 00:34:26,554
<i>For instance...</i>

534
00:34:26,637 --> 00:34:28,180
Holy night.

535
00:34:28,264 --> 00:34:30,432
<i>This is Kali from Brooklyn.</i>

536
00:34:30,516 --> 00:34:32,518
<i>Using his internet activity,
school records,</i>

537
00:34:32,601 --> 00:34:34,061
<i>and satellite surveillance,</i>

538
00:34:34,145 --> 00:34:38,232
<i>FALALA was able to ascertain that
he is Nice. And he wants a PlayStation.</i>

539
00:34:39,108 --> 00:34:42,653
<i>We're now standardizing
all packages in green, red,</i>

540
00:34:42,736 --> 00:34:45,489
<i>or the best of both, swirl.</i>

541
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:09,555
- Oh, what's this?
- Uh, guacamole?

542
00:35:09,638 --> 00:35:12,433
- Guaca-what? Gua...
- Guacamole?

543
00:35:12,516 --> 00:35:14,435
Guacamole? What is it made from?

544
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:16,729
Hi, Helen.

545
00:35:16,812 --> 00:35:19,064
Can I have $150 a day, please?

546
00:35:19,648 --> 00:35:22,318
Hey, Helen. We're all out of bird food.

547
00:35:22,401 --> 00:35:25,070
They seem to
really be enjoying the churros.

548
00:35:25,154 --> 00:35:27,865
Uh, you could buy some churros,
cut them into little pieces

549
00:35:27,948 --> 00:35:30,367
and sell them as reindeer treats,
like you said, Helen?

550
00:35:30,451 --> 00:35:33,913
Um, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, well...

551
00:35:33,996 --> 00:35:36,790
Don't keep these little nuggets
of brilliance all to yourself.

552
00:35:36,874 --> 00:35:38,918
How many great ideas
have you been sitting on?

553
00:35:40,377 --> 00:35:41,587
Three.

554
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:45,090
Let's get together. I'd love to hear
anything else you have to say.

555
00:35:45,674 --> 00:35:47,968
You're full of surprises. Mmm.

556
00:35:49,803 --> 00:35:51,514
Oh.

557
00:35:51,597 --> 00:35:52,598
Mmm-hmm.

558
00:35:52,681 --> 00:35:53,974
- You're the best.
- Oh, yeah.

559
00:35:56,936 --> 00:35:58,854
- Helen.
- Yes.

560
00:36:00,314 --> 00:36:01,565
I wouldn't... Um...

561
00:36:01,649 --> 00:36:05,653
I can't give you $150 in cash.

562
00:36:05,736 --> 00:36:08,906
But I can give you $150
in retail merchandise.

563
00:36:08,989 --> 00:36:12,618
What would you like?
Bath Bar, Cinnabon, Chrysler Pacifica?

564
00:36:12,701 --> 00:36:15,704
I don't know what those things are,
but I will take all of them.

565
00:36:15,788 --> 00:36:17,373
Also, can we stay here tonight?

566
00:36:23,796 --> 00:36:26,131
Come on. It's a Secret Santa party.

567
00:36:49,697 --> 00:36:50,698
Huh.

568
00:36:51,407 --> 00:36:53,033
Matt Bautista is nice.

569
00:36:55,786 --> 00:36:57,997
Santa, we're still not clear

570
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:03,169
how you plan to deliver billions
of presents with no sleigh or reindeer.

571
00:37:03,252 --> 00:37:07,298
First of all, there aren't actually
billions of presents, Elder Elf Abe.

572
00:37:07,381 --> 00:37:09,300
Our research indicates

573
00:37:09,383 --> 00:37:15,347
that there are only 2,837 nice children
in the world.

574
00:37:16,682 --> 00:37:17,850
What?

575
00:37:17,933 --> 00:37:20,519
Gabe, how is that possible?

576
00:37:20,603 --> 00:37:23,230
Nearly every child fibbed,

577
00:37:24,106 --> 00:37:26,025
refused to eat their vegetables,

578
00:37:26,108 --> 00:37:30,029
or failed to practice
proper dental hygiene.

579
00:37:30,112 --> 00:37:34,825
<i>Joy to the world
Except for you</i>

580
00:37:34,909 --> 00:37:39,497
<i>'Cause you forgot to floss</i>

581
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:43,918
Oh, no, you can't measure
a child like that.

582
00:37:44,001 --> 00:37:46,420
Everyone makes mistakes.

583
00:37:46,504 --> 00:37:52,009
Which is why each naughty child
will be receiving an evaluation notice

584
00:37:52,092 --> 00:37:53,677
explaining the decision

585
00:37:53,761 --> 00:37:56,263
and encouraging them
to do better next year.

586
00:37:56,347 --> 00:37:57,681
No!

587
00:38:01,143 --> 00:38:02,812
Kringle, come in.

588
00:38:02,895 --> 00:38:04,855
Was just lookin' at your case.

589
00:38:04,939 --> 00:38:05,940
Oh.

590
00:38:12,363 --> 00:38:14,198
Oh, hi! Who are you?

591
00:38:14,281 --> 00:38:16,408
Oh, this is my son. Alex, this is Noelle.

592
00:38:16,492 --> 00:38:17,618
- Hi.
- Hi!

593
00:38:17,701 --> 00:38:19,537
Oh, I totally see the resemblance.

594
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:22,873
I couldn't find any money,
but I did bring all this stuff.

595
00:38:24,041 --> 00:38:27,002
- Did you steal this stuff?
- Of course not. Stealing's naughty.

596
00:38:28,963 --> 00:38:31,882
- Is that the new <i>Madden?</i>
- I don't know, maybe.

597
00:38:31,966 --> 00:38:35,719
And also, I had all these
extra Christmas decorations

598
00:38:35,803 --> 00:38:39,765
in the sleeve... of my jacket.

599
00:38:39,849 --> 00:38:42,393
And I thought they might
brighten the place up a little.

600
00:38:42,476 --> 00:38:45,479
Oh, thanks, that's kind. I haven't
come up with much on your brother.

601
00:38:45,563 --> 00:38:49,650
I'm gonna need some more time, not today,
'cause Alex and I are going to laser tag.

602
00:38:49,733 --> 00:38:52,194
- I'd rather go to work with you, Dad.
- Me too!

603
00:38:52,278 --> 00:38:54,989
I never get to go to work.
Unless it's at the workshop.

604
00:38:55,072 --> 00:38:57,992
But we're not going to a workshop. Are we?

605
00:38:58,075 --> 00:39:01,203
I never get to see what you do.
It'll be interesting.

606
00:39:01,287 --> 00:39:02,705
So interesting.

607
00:39:02,788 --> 00:39:03,789
Um...

608
00:39:04,331 --> 00:39:08,419
I don't know about that. But, uh...
Sure, if that's what you want to do.

609
00:39:08,502 --> 00:39:10,129
Let me get your other file, Kringle.

610
00:39:13,132 --> 00:39:17,011
So, Alex, are you excited about Christmas?

611
00:39:17,094 --> 00:39:19,430
I have mixed feelings, honestly.

612
00:39:19,513 --> 00:39:22,057
About Christmas? How's that possible?

613
00:39:22,641 --> 00:39:23,893
It's complicated.

614
00:39:23,976 --> 00:39:25,811
Maybe you're just not eating enough.

615
00:39:26,353 --> 00:39:28,355
I can't. It's terrible.

616
00:39:28,439 --> 00:39:29,815
The eggs are rubbery,

617
00:39:29,899 --> 00:39:32,568
the bacon is burnt on the outside,
and raw in the middle.

618
00:39:32,651 --> 00:39:36,322
Pancakes bounce, I don't even know
what that is, and there's no seasoning.

619
00:39:36,405 --> 00:39:37,740
Would you like a candy cane?

620
00:39:37,823 --> 00:39:40,201
No, I have to eat this.

621
00:39:40,284 --> 00:39:42,828
I don't wanna hurt my dad's feelings,
he worked hard on it.

622
00:39:42,912 --> 00:39:45,915
Oh, well, maybe I can help.

623
00:39:45,998 --> 00:39:48,167
Just get a couple pancake...

624
00:39:49,251 --> 00:39:50,628
- Oh!
- Kringle!

625
00:39:52,421 --> 00:39:55,007
Hey! Good appetite.

626
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:58,010
That is how you grow up
strong and healthy.

627
00:39:58,594 --> 00:40:00,971
So, Kringle, I called the police,
the hospitals,

628
00:40:01,055 --> 00:40:02,848
the morgue,
the bureau of records, nothing.

629
00:40:02,932 --> 00:40:04,683
Only place left to check are the shelters.

630
00:40:05,267 --> 00:40:06,519
Shelters like igloos?

631
00:40:13,108 --> 00:40:15,027
Good morning,
welcome to Phoenix shelter.

632
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:16,153
How can I help you?

633
00:40:16,237 --> 00:40:20,407
Morning, my name's Jake Hapman.
I'm a licensed private detective.

634
00:40:20,491 --> 00:40:22,201
We're looking for a Nick Kringle.

635
00:40:22,284 --> 00:40:23,410
A Nick Kringle?

636
00:40:23,494 --> 00:40:26,372
He's about 6'2",
he's dressed in a red suit,

637
00:40:26,455 --> 00:40:28,916
he's got a beard, pom-pom.

638
00:40:28,999 --> 00:40:30,000
I have a picture.

639
00:40:30,084 --> 00:40:32,628
And, yes. I know how strange that sounds.

640
00:40:34,588 --> 00:40:36,757
- That's so beautiful.
- She can't hear you.

641
00:40:36,841 --> 00:40:38,843
- Oh. That's...
- She's deaf.

642
00:40:39,844 --> 00:40:40,845
Sorry.

643
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:45,140
It's really a lovely picture, though.

644
00:40:55,484 --> 00:40:58,988
My daughter says thank you,
and she wants to know what your name is.

645
00:40:59,071 --> 00:41:01,782
My name is Noelle.

646
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:05,411
Do you know sign?

647
00:41:07,204 --> 00:41:10,291
No. Not that I'm aware of, no.

648
00:41:15,588 --> 00:41:19,175
It's nice to meet you too, Michelle.
What do you want for Christmas?

649
00:41:30,811 --> 00:41:33,606
I need to go get her lunch,
but it was nice to meet you.

650
00:41:37,151 --> 00:41:39,403
An iPad. You got it.

651
00:41:42,406 --> 00:41:43,991
How did you just do that?

652
00:41:44,867 --> 00:41:47,745
I don't know. I don't.

653
00:41:47,828 --> 00:41:50,372
- Did you study it in school?
- No, I majored in calligraphy,

654
00:41:50,456 --> 00:41:52,458
I had a minor in popcorn stringing.

655
00:41:52,541 --> 00:41:54,543
And I...
None of this make sense.

656
00:41:54,627 --> 00:41:56,921
What kind of world is this? This is awful.

657
00:41:57,004 --> 00:42:00,925
You have people without homes
and food, and I'm so hot. God!

658
00:42:01,008 --> 00:42:03,385
Uh, do you have any ice in this town?

659
00:42:12,394 --> 00:42:14,855
Kringle, two minutes.

660
00:42:20,945 --> 00:42:22,822
Hello. Merry Christmas.

661
00:42:23,823 --> 00:42:25,825
- Can I get some fruit pops?
- Sure.

662
00:42:25,908 --> 00:42:27,868
Ooh, fruit pops. There you go.

663
00:42:27,952 --> 00:42:30,120
Do you want anything else?
Any gelato or...

664
00:42:30,204 --> 00:42:32,248
No, I think I'm good. Thanks.

665
00:42:32,331 --> 00:42:34,333
I like your pants, they're jolly.

666
00:42:34,416 --> 00:42:37,878
Yeah. They're yoga pants. Like yours.

667
00:42:38,629 --> 00:42:41,715
Yes. And these are my yogurt pants.

668
00:42:42,383 --> 00:42:46,554
No. Yoga... pants.

669
00:42:46,637 --> 00:42:50,266
Oh, yeah. I love yogurt pants.

670
00:42:52,101 --> 00:42:55,187
- Never mind.
- Okay. Bye.

671
00:42:55,271 --> 00:42:56,689
She was weird, right?

672
00:42:57,481 --> 00:42:58,774
Where are you from?

673
00:42:58,858 --> 00:43:00,359
A little town up north.

674
00:43:00,985 --> 00:43:03,195
- You mean Canada?
- Canada wishes.

675
00:43:04,113 --> 00:43:06,907
Mmm, instant hot chocolate?
Is this for real?

676
00:43:06,991 --> 00:43:10,661
It's a powder. You pour hot water in it
and it becomes hot chocolate, instantly.

677
00:43:10,744 --> 00:43:12,454
Mmm, sounds naughty.

678
00:43:12,538 --> 00:43:15,249
It's way better when you make it
with real melted chocolate.

679
00:43:15,833 --> 00:43:17,042
Yeah, I agree.

680
00:43:17,126 --> 00:43:19,837
- That's how we used to make it.
- With your mom and dad?

681
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,214
We tried to keep my dad
out of the kitchen,

682
00:43:22,298 --> 00:43:24,383
but he was in charge of
putting lights in the tree

683
00:43:24,466 --> 00:43:25,676
and we'd hang stockings together.

684
00:43:25,759 --> 00:43:27,511
This toy is messy.

685
00:43:27,595 --> 00:43:30,431
I don't think
we're gonna be doing that this year.

686
00:43:31,515 --> 00:43:32,725
'Cause it's complicated?

687
00:43:34,226 --> 00:43:36,896
Yeah. Well, it's still Christmas,
you know?

688
00:43:36,979 --> 00:43:38,647
And you still get a present from Santa.

689
00:43:39,273 --> 00:43:40,316
Oh...

690
00:43:40,399 --> 00:43:41,567
It's kind of offensive.

691
00:43:42,151 --> 00:43:45,070
- I don't think I still believe in Santa.
- Santa's real.

692
00:43:45,154 --> 00:43:47,698
He's under a lot of pressure right now,
but he's very real.

693
00:43:47,781 --> 00:43:51,118
In fact, if you tell me what you want,
put in a good word for ya. Hmm?

694
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:54,288
Come on, give me a shot.

695
00:43:54,955 --> 00:43:56,207
Try me, come on.

696
00:43:57,541 --> 00:44:00,377
- Okay. I think I want...
- Hey, Kringle.

697
00:44:00,461 --> 00:44:02,338
- I found your brother.
- What?

698
00:44:02,421 --> 00:44:03,631
- Yep.
- How?

699
00:44:03,714 --> 00:44:04,840
The yoga pants.

700
00:44:04,924 --> 00:44:06,842
- Why do people keep saying that to me?
- Yoga.

701
00:44:06,926 --> 00:44:10,095
You said Nick wanted to breathe,
stretch and relax? I did some googling,

702
00:44:10,179 --> 00:44:13,974
and I found a Christmas Yoga Class
taught by a Nick K.

703
00:44:14,058 --> 00:44:16,519
Nick K? Nick K! That's him! Ah!

704
00:44:16,602 --> 00:44:20,189
Let's go find him.
Ready, and one, two, three...

705
00:44:20,272 --> 00:44:22,483
- I'm gonna drop Alex at my sister's...
- Okay.

706
00:44:22,566 --> 00:44:24,443
- ...and I'll drive you up there.
- Um, sir...

707
00:44:25,152 --> 00:44:26,862
This says Santy Claus.

708
00:44:26,946 --> 00:44:29,490
You know it's Santa Claus. I...

709
00:44:29,573 --> 00:44:33,160
These'll just get sent back if you
don't fix that. Okay, thank you, bye.

710
00:44:35,913 --> 00:44:40,125
You know what you need to do? You need to
get Alex the perfect Christmas present.

711
00:44:40,209 --> 00:44:45,047
What about a cheese grater for Alex.
Or a George Foreman Grill?

712
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:46,465
Alex doesn't cook.

713
00:44:47,007 --> 00:44:48,008
Oh.

714
00:44:48,092 --> 00:44:49,718
Are you sure?

715
00:44:49,802 --> 00:44:53,180
He analyzed the breakfast you gave him
this morning in great detail.

716
00:44:53,264 --> 00:44:54,640
He really warmed up to you.

717
00:44:55,975 --> 00:44:58,811
- He's a great kid, isn't he?
- Yeah. Oh, steak knives.

718
00:44:58,894 --> 00:45:04,859
Sometimes, I feel like a hyped-up
camp counselor when he's around.

719
00:45:04,942 --> 00:45:07,486
I have to make sure
he's havin' a good time

720
00:45:07,570 --> 00:45:09,905
since we don't get to
see each other as much.

721
00:45:09,989 --> 00:45:12,074
And I feel guilty and...

722
00:45:12,158 --> 00:45:14,076
And then I overcompensate and...

723
00:45:15,870 --> 00:45:17,037
I don't know.

724
00:45:18,956 --> 00:45:20,040
That must be hard.

725
00:45:22,543 --> 00:45:25,796
Anyway, here we are.

726
00:45:32,178 --> 00:45:33,470
Oh, hey, there it is.

727
00:45:34,221 --> 00:45:35,723
Okay.

728
00:45:35,806 --> 00:45:39,727
You were so great with Alex,
I wanted to give you this.

729
00:45:40,895 --> 00:45:43,397
This, thank you.

730
00:45:43,481 --> 00:45:45,816
Wow. Um, it's, uh...

731
00:45:46,358 --> 00:45:47,860
Oh, mmm...

732
00:45:47,943 --> 00:45:50,070
Yeah, it's... Oh, okay.

733
00:45:51,822 --> 00:45:54,658
Oh, my gosh, it's magical. Look at that.

734
00:45:56,452 --> 00:45:58,078
- Uh...
- Ugh.

735
00:45:59,497 --> 00:46:01,123
Stuffed chimneys!

736
00:46:01,207 --> 00:46:04,001
It smells like it should taste good,
but it doesn't.

737
00:46:04,084 --> 00:46:07,546
You're supposed to put in on your face.
Haven't you ever used sunblock before?

738
00:46:08,088 --> 00:46:10,257
Yeah, sunblock. No, I love sunblock.

739
00:46:10,341 --> 00:46:13,761
It's for blocking the sun.
It's great. Is that good?

740
00:46:13,844 --> 00:46:15,638
You might wanna spread it around.

741
00:46:15,721 --> 00:46:18,724
Oh, no, yeah, I forgot to
spread it around. Just like that.

742
00:46:18,807 --> 00:46:20,518
It's burning. Oh, my God, it's in my eye.

743
00:46:20,601 --> 00:46:22,102
- Well, you wanna...
- It's in my eye.

744
00:46:22,186 --> 00:46:24,730
- What do you like about this product?
- Stay still. Let me...

745
00:46:24,814 --> 00:46:26,774
- Stop. Just gotta rub it in.
- Okay, yep!

746
00:46:26,857 --> 00:46:30,402
- Just stay still.
- Worse than getting hit with a slush ball.

747
00:46:30,486 --> 00:46:34,073
Just gotta... You got a couple of
extra coats, but...

748
00:46:36,534 --> 00:46:39,620
Never know when you're gonna need
an extra coat. It is winter.

749
00:46:41,372 --> 00:46:43,332
- Thanks!
- No problem.

750
00:46:43,415 --> 00:46:45,000
All right. Good luck in there.

751
00:46:46,001 --> 00:46:47,545
Say hello to your brother for me.

752
00:46:47,628 --> 00:46:49,797
Will do. Merry Christmas.

753
00:46:58,264 --> 00:47:02,268
Breathe in through your nose,
out your mouth.

754
00:47:03,310 --> 00:47:07,481
Now assume... downward facing reindeer.

755
00:47:11,235 --> 00:47:14,363
Very good, Cindy. Pete?

756
00:47:14,947 --> 00:47:17,074
Ow!

757
00:47:17,158 --> 00:47:20,327
Hey, hey!

758
00:47:20,411 --> 00:47:23,539
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

759
00:47:23,622 --> 00:47:26,584
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here? This is crazy.

760
00:47:26,667 --> 00:47:30,129
- What's on your face?
- Oh! Oh, it's sunblock.

761
00:47:30,212 --> 00:47:31,755
Yeah, the heat here, right?

762
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:35,467
It's like being locked in the cookie
cottage during toll-house season, right?

763
00:47:35,551 --> 00:47:37,553
- Oh, by the way... You scared me so much.
- Shh!

764
00:47:37,636 --> 00:47:39,221
- Come on.
- Yoga voice.

765
00:47:39,305 --> 00:47:41,307
- You had me worried sick.
- Yoga voice.

766
00:47:41,390 --> 00:47:44,560
- Mom's been beside herself.
- Yoga voice. Stop. Wait. Ellie, I'm sorry.

767
00:47:44,643 --> 00:47:47,480
I'm sorry, okay. Just hold on.
Can't let anybody hear.

768
00:47:49,231 --> 00:47:52,401
Listen, I like it here. Okay?

769
00:47:52,485 --> 00:47:56,906
I like the weather. I like yoga, I mean,
I donated all my thermals to charity.

770
00:47:56,989 --> 00:47:59,200
Weird, you can tell me about it
in the sleigh.

771
00:47:59,283 --> 00:48:00,868
No, listen. I'm...

772
00:48:02,745 --> 00:48:03,829
I'm not going back.

773
00:48:04,497 --> 00:48:07,458
I'm sorry, I must have
cotton candy in my ears.

774
00:48:07,541 --> 00:48:12,588
I know. I can't pretend to be
someone I'm not anymore.

775
00:48:12,671 --> 00:48:16,050
I could, but I start to break out
in a rash, and my hair starts to...

776
00:48:16,133 --> 00:48:18,177
Okay, Nick, I understand.

777
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:21,472
You're under a lot of pressure and I know
what it's like to be a Kringle,

778
00:48:21,555 --> 00:48:24,308
- this family legacy we have to live up to.
- Not the same thing.

779
00:48:24,391 --> 00:48:26,227
Well, I am Santa's daughter, so...

780
00:48:26,310 --> 00:48:28,979
Well, no one's ever expected anything
of you, Noelle.

781
00:48:30,898 --> 00:48:34,026
I mean, I've been training
to be Santa my whole life.

782
00:48:34,109 --> 00:48:36,487
While you've been... What?
Cutting ribbon,

783
00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:39,448
and making your silly cards?

784
00:48:39,532 --> 00:48:41,909
- Thought you liked my cards.
- I do.

785
00:48:41,992 --> 00:48:43,828
I'm sorry I said that.
I do like your cards.

786
00:48:43,911 --> 00:48:46,121
They're very creative.
I admire your <i>shakti.</i>

787
00:48:46,205 --> 00:48:48,499
- My what?
- Your female energy.

788
00:48:48,582 --> 00:48:51,710
Besides, you're the one
that told me to go.

789
00:48:51,794 --> 00:48:54,755
You said, you, you said,
"Go! Take some time."

790
00:48:54,839 --> 00:48:57,967
I said take the weekend.
Nobody listens to me.

791
00:48:58,050 --> 00:48:59,510
You know how hard this has been?

792
00:48:59,593 --> 00:49:01,595
Everybody at home is blaming me,
yelling at me,

793
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:03,931
and nobody's giving me
my Kringle discount anymore.

794
00:49:04,014 --> 00:49:06,141
So it doesn't matter
that I'm finally happy

795
00:49:06,225 --> 00:49:09,770
or that me leaving the Pole was the
best thing I could've done for Christmas.

796
00:49:09,854 --> 00:49:11,647
All that matters
is what's happening to you.

797
00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:14,441
Oh, you better not pout,
you better not cry.

798
00:49:14,525 --> 00:49:16,360
All I have ever done is try to help you.

799
00:49:16,443 --> 00:49:19,488
You're a coward who's too afraid
to be Santa Claus!

800
00:49:19,572 --> 00:49:23,367
Exactly! Bingo! Partridge in a pear tree!
That's what I've been trying to tell you!

801
00:49:23,450 --> 00:49:27,037
- Then I guess, that's all there is to say.
- Wait, where are you going?

802
00:49:27,121 --> 00:49:30,207
I'm going to the North Pole
where nobody expects anything from me.

803
00:49:30,291 --> 00:49:32,251
Do you know what?
If I wasn't so enlightened,

804
00:49:32,334 --> 00:49:33,752
I'd be seething with anger right now.

805
00:49:33,836 --> 00:49:34,920
- Oh, ho, ho!
- Yeah!

806
00:49:35,004 --> 00:49:36,881
- So now you don't like my <i>shakti?</i>
- No!

807
00:49:36,964 --> 00:49:38,340
You don't like my female energy?

808
00:49:38,424 --> 00:49:39,967
- Is this too much for you?
- Relax.

809
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:41,552
Oh, I'll give you female energy.

810
00:49:42,261 --> 00:49:43,345
Oh!

811
00:49:43,429 --> 00:49:45,097
Get ready, 'cause I...

812
00:49:46,015 --> 00:49:47,558
Don't do that. Please.

813
00:49:49,310 --> 00:49:51,312
Wow! That's a big deal in here.

814
00:49:53,689 --> 00:49:55,065
Merry Christmas!

815
00:49:58,444 --> 00:50:01,447
<i>Come see
and play with Santa's reindeer,</i>

816
00:50:01,530 --> 00:50:03,782
<i>only at Desert Ridge Marketplace.</i>

817
00:50:03,866 --> 00:50:04,950
Ooh!

818
00:50:05,034 --> 00:50:06,577
Look at the reindeer!

819
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:09,163
Nick's happy here.
Yeah, he wants to stay.

820
00:50:09,246 --> 00:50:12,333
You know what? Maybe it'll be fine.
Maybe Gabe will be a great Santa.

821
00:50:12,416 --> 00:50:15,127
- Hey, Noelle.
- What are you guys doing here?

822
00:50:15,211 --> 00:50:17,546
We heard about these amazing reindeer
at the mall.

823
00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:18,797
Are you a part of this?

824
00:50:18,881 --> 00:50:22,051
Well, yes, I know these reindeer.

825
00:50:25,137 --> 00:50:26,305
Who are these people?

826
00:50:26,388 --> 00:50:28,474
Oh, Jake, Alex. This is Elf...

827
00:50:29,225 --> 00:50:32,686
This is my aunt, Polly.
She plays an elf in the show.

828
00:50:32,770 --> 00:50:34,480
A grumpy, bitter, miserable elf.

829
00:50:34,563 --> 00:50:36,649
I thought elves were
supposed to be like, uh...

830
00:50:36,732 --> 00:50:39,985
Cute? That's a common misconception.

831
00:50:41,195 --> 00:50:43,447
Now wait a minute.
I wanna show you something.

832
00:50:44,490 --> 00:50:47,034
See this? What do you think it does?

833
00:50:47,827 --> 00:50:50,663
Nothing. It's just for show. Try those.

834
00:50:50,746 --> 00:50:52,665
So, how'd it go with your brother?

835
00:50:52,748 --> 00:50:55,292
Oh, not great. Yeah, we got in
a big argument. So...

836
00:50:55,918 --> 00:50:57,837
- The holidays can be tough.
- Mmm.

837
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,340
Alex is spending Christmas
with his step-dad and my ex, Jessie.

838
00:51:01,423 --> 00:51:03,425
This is the first holiday
since the divorce.

839
00:51:03,509 --> 00:51:05,302
So he's havin' a rough time.

840
00:51:05,386 --> 00:51:07,555
She's invited me over
for Christmas morning.

841
00:51:07,638 --> 00:51:10,057
That's amazing!
Oh, Alex would love that so much.

842
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:12,893
- You're gonna go, right?
- I think she just feels obligated.

843
00:51:12,977 --> 00:51:15,896
It'll probably be awkward,
I don't wanna ruin Christmas for Alex.

844
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:18,315
I'm gonna stay at home,
put a frozen pizza in the oven

845
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:21,360
and watch some basketball.
Like a total loser.

846
00:51:21,443 --> 00:51:23,654
Dad! The sleigh is amazing.

847
00:51:23,737 --> 00:51:24,989
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

848
00:51:25,072 --> 00:51:28,242
I don't wanna be a party pooper,
but I think it's time we get goin'.

849
00:51:29,535 --> 00:51:31,370
When are we gonna see
Noelle and Polly again?

850
00:51:31,453 --> 00:51:33,956
- Probably never.
- Polly! That...

851
00:51:34,999 --> 00:51:38,294
Well, I do have somewhere
I need to be for Christmas.

852
00:51:38,377 --> 00:51:42,173
But you're gonna get your wish and spend
Christmas with your whole family.

853
00:51:42,256 --> 00:51:44,633
Because you're nice. I mean, officially.

854
00:51:47,344 --> 00:51:50,014
Come on. Thanks, guys. It was...

855
00:51:50,097 --> 00:51:51,182
It was jolly.

856
00:51:53,726 --> 00:51:56,103
Oh, I hope their Christmas works out.

857
00:51:56,687 --> 00:51:58,898
Oh, well, look at you.

858
00:51:58,981 --> 00:52:02,193
Worrying about someone else's Christmas
and not your own.

859
00:52:02,276 --> 00:52:04,195
Now that is very mature.

860
00:52:05,279 --> 00:52:06,697
Thank you, Polly.

861
00:52:07,865 --> 00:52:09,825
Oh! Snowcone!

862
00:52:11,952 --> 00:52:13,954
What are you doing here?

863
00:52:14,038 --> 00:52:15,831
How did you get here?

864
00:52:15,915 --> 00:52:17,791
Did you fly here all by yourself?

865
00:52:18,584 --> 00:52:20,586
Polly! Look who it is.

866
00:52:21,504 --> 00:52:25,299
You're so brave. You must have picked up
my scent from all the people in Phoenix.

867
00:52:25,382 --> 00:52:27,968
How many people
wear gingerbread deodorant?`

868
00:52:29,136 --> 00:52:32,181
Oh. What have you got? It's from Mother.

869
00:52:32,765 --> 00:52:36,227
"Noelle, I know I was angry,
but even though you acted selfishly

870
00:52:36,310 --> 00:52:38,270
"and foolishly and immaturely, and..."

871
00:52:38,354 --> 00:52:40,940
Right, I'm gonna skip ahead.

872
00:52:41,524 --> 00:52:43,442
"Disrespectfully, childishly.

873
00:52:43,526 --> 00:52:46,237
"You must find your brother
and bring him home because...

874
00:52:47,196 --> 00:52:51,784
"Gabe says there are
only 2,837 nice children,

875
00:52:51,867 --> 00:52:56,330
"and wants to deliver their presents by
drone or something called Amazon Prime.

876
00:52:56,914 --> 00:52:58,749
"As Kringles, for 2,000 years,

877
00:52:58,833 --> 00:53:02,294
"we've dedicated ourselves to bringing
the joy and happiness that is Christmas

878
00:53:02,378 --> 00:53:04,797
"to the world and we must make sure
nothing changes that.

879
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:09,093
"So I sent you the last flying reindeer in
the Pole to help you rescue your brother."

880
00:53:27,444 --> 00:53:28,696
<i>Okay, Snowy,</i>

881
00:53:28,779 --> 00:53:31,365
you found me, so I know
you can find Santa, okay?

882
00:53:31,448 --> 00:53:34,660
He smells like hot chocolate and
peppermint, now it's mixed with incense.

883
00:53:34,743 --> 00:53:36,287
He's on a whole journey.

884
00:53:36,370 --> 00:53:38,205
But I need you to track him. Okay?

885
00:53:38,289 --> 00:53:39,874
But we can't take you out
looking like this.

886
00:53:54,722 --> 00:53:57,433
Just walkin' my dog, you know.

887
00:53:57,516 --> 00:54:00,519
His name is Rover. Which is a dog's name.

888
00:54:00,603 --> 00:54:03,314
That's why I named him that.
It's a very rare breed.

889
00:54:03,397 --> 00:54:05,858
He's a white Polar Poodle.

890
00:54:05,941 --> 00:54:08,027
You smell something? What do you smell?

891
00:54:08,110 --> 00:54:10,029
Whoa! Rover!

892
00:54:12,114 --> 00:54:14,116
- Merry Christmas, everybody.
- Rover!

893
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:15,659
Please make a donation.

894
00:54:19,914 --> 00:54:22,041
What do you smell, boy? Was Santa here?

895
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,086
Yeah? What do you smell?
Where'd he go? Did he go this way?

896
00:54:26,629 --> 00:54:27,630
He go this way?

897
00:54:31,509 --> 00:54:33,260
I don't understand.
It's very professional,

898
00:54:33,344 --> 00:54:36,180
you look very Dasher junior.
We gotta find Santa.

899
00:54:41,852 --> 00:54:44,647
Next stop, Desert Botanical Gardens.
Yoga retreat.

900
00:54:47,274 --> 00:54:48,275
Okay!

901
00:54:49,735 --> 00:54:51,111
After you.

902
00:55:23,352 --> 00:55:27,481
Oh, okay. Great job, little guy.
Wish me luck.

903
00:55:45,249 --> 00:55:46,250
Nick.

904
00:55:47,459 --> 00:55:49,044
Hi, I know you're mad at me.

905
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:50,588
Um...

906
00:55:50,671 --> 00:55:56,260
There's things going on at home
that... only Santa can fix.

907
00:55:58,762 --> 00:56:00,764
Really. See for yourself.

908
00:56:05,436 --> 00:56:10,900
Okay. I realize I wasn't seeing things
from your point of view.

909
00:56:10,983 --> 00:56:12,902
Nobody asked you
if you wanted to wear the hat.

910
00:56:12,985 --> 00:56:15,446
We all expected you to take the reins
and that's not fair.

911
00:56:15,529 --> 00:56:18,866
And... I'm sorry.

912
00:56:21,619 --> 00:56:22,995
But we really need you.

913
00:56:26,207 --> 00:56:27,791
Nick, won't you even speak to me?

914
00:56:31,754 --> 00:56:32,838
Silent for how long?

915
00:56:34,006 --> 00:56:36,133
When the flowers, yeah, when...

916
00:56:36,217 --> 00:56:38,093
It's the... Is this a...

917
00:56:38,177 --> 00:56:40,471
And a... A hand comes in.

918
00:56:40,554 --> 00:56:42,973
Is that a bird landing?

919
00:56:43,057 --> 00:56:45,559
You were always bad at charades.
This will take forever.

920
00:56:45,643 --> 00:56:47,144
Two words? Two words.

921
00:56:47,228 --> 00:56:49,605
Two words. First word, me.

922
00:56:49,688 --> 00:56:50,940
Until sunrise.

923
00:56:51,023 --> 00:56:52,399
Shh!

924
00:56:53,108 --> 00:56:55,694
Okay. Well, I can wait till sunrise.

925
00:56:55,778 --> 00:56:57,822
- No!
- Talk at sunrise. Yeah.

926
00:56:57,905 --> 00:56:59,824
- I'll wait until sunrise.
- You gotta go.

927
00:56:59,907 --> 00:57:03,118
- I'll be quiet as a mouse.
- You've never been quiet. Get outta here.

928
00:57:03,202 --> 00:57:05,579
- I'm quiet all the time.
- One, two, three, be quiet.

929
00:57:06,831 --> 00:57:08,582
I was only...

930
00:57:08,666 --> 00:57:11,919
- I was talking 'cause you were talking.
- See! You can't do it.

931
00:57:12,002 --> 00:57:16,090
Noelle, I'm sorry, you gotta go.

932
00:57:17,091 --> 00:57:18,133
Okay.

933
00:57:20,010 --> 00:57:23,097
I'm just gonna leave this.
You don't have to read it.

934
00:57:23,639 --> 00:57:24,890
Just, if you want to.

935
00:57:26,725 --> 00:57:27,810
I love you.

936
00:57:29,311 --> 00:57:30,437
Whatever you wanna do.

937
00:57:44,785 --> 00:57:45,953
Relax.

938
00:57:48,372 --> 00:57:49,665
<i>Team tracks for Texas.</i>

939
00:57:49,748 --> 00:57:51,625
<i>He drives down the court,
it's an easy lay-up.</i>

940
00:57:51,709 --> 00:57:55,004
- It helps if you put salt on it.
- No one has that much salt, Dad.

941
00:57:56,338 --> 00:57:57,339
Oh.

942
00:57:58,132 --> 00:57:59,466
What did I do wrong?

943
00:57:59,550 --> 00:58:01,886
You can make the pan hotter
before you put the meat in.

944
00:58:01,969 --> 00:58:03,596
Don't press the patties down so hard.

945
00:58:03,679 --> 00:58:06,599
It loses the juices and gets dried out.
And if you toast the bun,

946
00:58:06,682 --> 00:58:09,560
and put some butter on it, it gives it
this crunchy texture each bite.

947
00:58:09,643 --> 00:58:12,688
Oh, why didn't you tell me
you were into cooking?

948
00:58:13,272 --> 00:58:15,316
I thought maybe you wouldn't like it.

949
00:58:15,399 --> 00:58:18,569
Hey, man, I like everything you do.

950
00:58:19,403 --> 00:58:21,530
Hey, maybe you could give me some lessons.

951
00:58:24,867 --> 00:58:27,703
<i>Guess who's coming
to the marketplace. Santa!</i>

952
00:58:27,786 --> 00:58:29,705
<i>Hope you've been nice this year.</i>

953
00:58:29,788 --> 00:58:31,290
Let's go over there.

954
00:58:39,548 --> 00:58:41,717
Supercuts. How do I look?

955
00:58:42,343 --> 00:58:43,469
Like Prancer.

956
00:58:44,053 --> 00:58:46,972
More like Vixen,
with that tuft of hair up there.

957
00:58:49,183 --> 00:58:50,935
Santa!

958
00:58:51,018 --> 00:58:52,603
- Nick. Hey!
- Hey.

959
00:58:52,686 --> 00:58:54,730
I'm so sorry.

960
00:58:54,814 --> 00:58:58,901
Look. What's happening at the Pole
is very naughty.

961
00:58:59,735 --> 00:59:01,028
But I can't be Santa.

962
00:59:01,111 --> 00:59:03,155
The Santa that they hired isn't here yet.

963
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:05,658
Sit with a couple of kids,
you'll feel The Twinkle.

964
00:59:05,741 --> 00:59:09,578
And if you don't, no more pressure.
I will leave you alone. I almost promise.

965
00:59:10,412 --> 00:59:12,206
- I can't, Ellie.
- Nick Kringle,

966
00:59:12,289 --> 00:59:15,668
this is in your blood. It's in your stars.

967
00:59:15,751 --> 00:59:17,169
It's in your destiny.

968
00:59:17,253 --> 00:59:19,672
I left the suit in the North Pole.

969
00:59:19,755 --> 00:59:21,757
That's a problem, Nick. Come on.

970
00:59:22,383 --> 00:59:24,009
This costume is ridiculous.

971
00:59:24,093 --> 00:59:26,303
I don't see any difference
from what you usually wear.

972
00:59:26,387 --> 00:59:27,847
- Excuse me?
- Or...

973
00:59:27,972 --> 00:59:29,682
You think I look like this all the time?

974
00:59:29,765 --> 00:59:32,434
Worst thing anyone's ever said to me.
You, gather the reindeer.

975
00:59:32,518 --> 00:59:35,646
- We're doing this and going home.
- Well, how is it different?

976
00:59:35,729 --> 00:59:37,940
Little lower and to the right, please.

977
00:59:39,441 --> 00:59:41,485
I just don't think
it's that great of an idea.

978
00:59:41,569 --> 00:59:42,570
Santa!

979
00:59:42,653 --> 00:59:44,405
- It'll be great.
- There's a lot of them.

980
00:59:44,488 --> 00:59:46,282
- I don't know...
- You're gonna be great.

981
00:59:46,365 --> 00:59:48,742
Santa is so excited to meet you guys.

982
00:59:51,954 --> 00:59:54,206
You got this. Come on up.

983
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:55,708
Go ahead. Go on.

984
00:59:55,791 --> 00:59:58,335
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! Hi!

985
00:59:59,795 --> 01:00:01,505
Merry Christmas. What's your name?

986
01:00:06,969 --> 01:00:08,304
Right back at you.

987
01:00:16,979 --> 01:00:20,399
- His name's Ajeet. He's from India.
- Wait, how do you know that?

988
01:00:20,774 --> 01:00:22,401
I don't know. You pick stuff up.

989
01:00:22,985 --> 01:00:25,404
For Christmas, he wants his cousin
to come live with him

990
01:00:25,488 --> 01:00:27,156
- in Phoenix, Arizona.
- Okay.

991
01:00:29,992 --> 01:00:31,702
- And an iPad.
- An iPad. I got that.

992
01:00:32,286 --> 01:00:34,497
That was fun, right? Merry Christmas.

993
01:00:35,164 --> 01:00:37,666
- Do we break for lunch now or is that...
- No!

994
01:00:40,461 --> 01:00:43,964
- Hello!
- Let's not make a meal out of this.

995
01:00:44,048 --> 01:00:48,552
I'm only doing it so my parents
can practice using Snapchat.

996
01:00:50,346 --> 01:00:54,391
Got it. So, Merry Christmas.
What's your name?

997
01:00:54,475 --> 01:00:57,061
Tonya. Tonya Cooperman.

998
01:00:57,478 --> 01:01:01,065
Tonya Cooperman.
And have you been a good girl?

999
01:01:01,148 --> 01:01:03,734
I really don't see
how that's your business.

1000
01:01:03,818 --> 01:01:05,069
You're right. I'm sorry.

1001
01:01:05,152 --> 01:01:07,154
That was over the line, um...

1002
01:01:07,947 --> 01:01:10,449
Let's say you were a good girl,

1003
01:01:11,534 --> 01:01:13,118
what do you want for Christmas?

1004
01:01:13,202 --> 01:01:15,329
Why? You're gonna get it for me?

1005
01:01:15,412 --> 01:01:18,249
A pathetic mall Santa?

1006
01:01:18,332 --> 01:01:21,043
You're right.
He's not gonna get it for you.

1007
01:01:21,126 --> 01:01:24,213
Because you were so mean to Jennie Stalts
just 'cause she has a lisp.

1008
01:01:24,296 --> 01:01:26,549
Tonya, Jennie is your best friend.

1009
01:01:26,632 --> 01:01:27,883
Get over here.

1010
01:01:28,926 --> 01:01:30,511
How'd you know about Jennie Stalts?

1011
01:01:30,594 --> 01:01:32,721
She had a Jennie Stalts vibe,
I don't know.

1012
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:37,017
Usually, it takes people years of yoga
to get that kind of awareness.

1013
01:01:39,645 --> 01:01:41,105
Oh, I see my friend. I'll be back.

1014
01:01:41,188 --> 01:01:42,857
- Wait, no!
- You're doing great!

1015
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:46,235
No, I'm not. Please,
I don't know what I'm doing.

1016
01:01:47,695 --> 01:01:48,696
Next.

1017
01:01:50,823 --> 01:01:52,992
Hi, Merry Christmas. What's your name?

1018
01:01:53,075 --> 01:01:55,286
Why did you write this to me, Santa?

1019
01:01:56,829 --> 01:01:59,999
"Dear Roberto, due to your
continuous failure to make your bed,

1020
01:02:00,082 --> 01:02:02,626
"you will not be receiving
a present this year.

1021
01:02:02,710 --> 01:02:04,712
"We invite you
to correct this naughty flaw

1022
01:02:04,795 --> 01:02:07,339
"and reapply for present status
next Christmas."

1023
01:02:07,423 --> 01:02:08,799
Yeah, I didn't write that.

1024
01:02:09,675 --> 01:02:12,678
"Best wishes, Santa." Hmm. Right there.

1025
01:02:12,761 --> 01:02:14,430
- I got one too.
- I got one too.

1026
01:02:14,513 --> 01:02:16,599
- I got one.
- I got one too.

1027
01:02:17,224 --> 01:02:20,519
Hey! Oh, my God! I'm so jolly you're here.

1028
01:02:21,479 --> 01:02:25,107
Did you tell Alex that I would spend
Christmas with him and my ex-wife?

1029
01:02:25,566 --> 01:02:28,944
Yeah. It's his Christmas wish
to go to that Chinese restaurant

1030
01:02:29,028 --> 01:02:31,655
you guys always go to
on Christmas day, Sun Ming,

1031
01:02:31,739 --> 01:02:33,949
and have the red and green egg rolls.

1032
01:02:34,033 --> 01:02:35,993
But I told you,
Jessie and I don't get along.

1033
01:02:36,076 --> 01:02:40,039
She has a new life with her husband
and Alex, and I can't go over there.

1034
01:02:40,122 --> 01:02:43,417
Yeah. But if you use Christmas
to open up and talk about it...

1035
01:02:43,501 --> 01:02:46,086
Me? Open up?

1036
01:02:46,504 --> 01:02:48,297
Kringle, you're the one who omits things.

1037
01:02:48,380 --> 01:02:51,926
Like how you can speak sign language,
or chocolate money.

1038
01:02:53,427 --> 01:02:56,847
No. That's fair, um, yeah.

1039
01:03:02,686 --> 01:03:06,315
My dad was Santa Claus, he was great.

1040
01:03:06,649 --> 01:03:08,859
Every Christmas Eve,
he would slide down the chimney.

1041
01:03:08,943 --> 01:03:12,321
Could've come in the front door, but he
wanted to give us the full treatment.

1042
01:03:12,404 --> 01:03:16,325
Nick and I would peek out from our rooms,
I'd say I saw Mommy kissing Santa Claus.

1043
01:03:16,408 --> 01:03:18,160
And then Dad would sit with us

1044
01:03:18,244 --> 01:03:21,747
and tell us about his night,
and that was my favorite present.

1045
01:03:21,831 --> 01:03:26,043
And then, Elf Polly, now Aunt Polly,

1046
01:03:26,126 --> 01:03:27,753
um, she would take us to bed.

1047
01:03:28,796 --> 01:03:31,215
Six months ago, Dad died,

1048
01:03:31,298 --> 01:03:33,801
so, Nick became Santa
and he was feeling overwhelmed,

1049
01:03:33,884 --> 01:03:36,637
so I told him that he should
take some time off,

1050
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:38,681
get away for a while and he wound up here,

1051
01:03:38,764 --> 01:03:40,766
and now he wants to stay and do yoga,

1052
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:43,519
and, um, everybody in the North Pole
is really mad at me.

1053
01:03:43,602 --> 01:03:47,148
So, I took the sleigh and the reindeer
to bring him back.

1054
01:03:52,945 --> 01:03:55,406
All right, thank you
for being so nice to Alex.

1055
01:03:56,157 --> 01:03:58,909
Good luck, Kringle. Merry Christmas.

1056
01:04:03,289 --> 01:04:05,374
Look, there's another Santa!

1057
01:04:05,457 --> 01:04:08,085
What're you doing?
This is my gig. Time to move.

1058
01:04:08,169 --> 01:04:09,420
Can I just say one thing?

1059
01:04:09,503 --> 01:04:10,796
- I'm certified.
- Sorry.

1060
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:13,382
I have a diploma
from the Phoenix Santa school.

1061
01:04:13,465 --> 01:04:15,593
Sit back down.
This is where you belong.

1062
01:04:15,676 --> 01:04:18,888
- I belong in that chair.
- Excuse me. You sit down.

1063
01:04:18,971 --> 01:04:21,765
You are not even a real Santa.
I need you to show some respect.

1064
01:04:21,849 --> 01:04:24,560
- He's the real Santa.
- Let's discuss this over here.

1065
01:04:24,643 --> 01:04:26,020
Hey! You...

1066
01:04:27,688 --> 01:04:29,231
- You're coming with me.
- Oh, sorry!

1067
01:04:29,315 --> 01:04:31,358
- Leave her alone.
- This is unnecessary.

1068
01:04:31,442 --> 01:04:33,569
- Noelle!
- Nick, stay where you are.

1069
01:04:33,652 --> 01:04:35,779
- Sorry!
- These kids need to meet the real Santa.

1070
01:04:35,863 --> 01:04:37,865
- I'll give you a free yoga class.
- Uh...

1071
01:04:37,948 --> 01:04:41,619
Ho, ho, ho! Who is next? You, come on.

1072
01:04:46,081 --> 01:04:48,792
Look, my sister didn't mean any harm,
okay? She just...

1073
01:04:48,876 --> 01:04:50,878
She used to beat me up
for fun all the time.

1074
01:04:50,961 --> 01:04:53,631
She's just having fun, okay?
She's fun-loving.

1075
01:04:53,714 --> 01:04:55,716
I guess that's why she assaulted a cop.

1076
01:04:55,799 --> 01:04:58,511
She's talkin' about crazy things
like the North Pole and elves.

1077
01:04:58,594 --> 01:05:00,012
What's so crazy about elves?

1078
01:05:00,095 --> 01:05:02,640
They're holding her
for psychiatric evaluation.

1079
01:05:02,723 --> 01:05:04,934
Wait, tomorrow is Christmas Eve, though.

1080
01:05:05,017 --> 01:05:07,061
Thanks for the reminder.
I still gotta shop.

1081
01:05:07,144 --> 01:05:11,607
You still need to shop? Well, you know,
I can get you whatever you want.

1082
01:05:12,608 --> 01:05:15,069
You know? Straight from the workshop.

1083
01:05:16,028 --> 01:05:20,991
You want a My Little Pony Explore
Equestria Crystal Empire Castle playset?

1084
01:05:21,075 --> 01:05:22,284
Done.

1085
01:05:23,077 --> 01:05:25,663
I'll get it for you. With accessories.

1086
01:05:26,038 --> 01:05:27,456
I don't have any kids.

1087
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:28,791
What a shock.

1088
01:05:32,711 --> 01:05:35,339
There's only two days
till Christmas.

1089
01:05:37,132 --> 01:05:39,635
Why don't you just eat
the whole gavel, Elder Elf Abe?

1090
01:05:39,718 --> 01:05:44,265
Now, I say we take all 2,837 presents,

1091
01:05:44,348 --> 01:05:48,644
put them on a motorized ice floe
with GPS coordinates and...

1092
01:05:48,727 --> 01:05:50,646
He can't do it!

1093
01:05:50,729 --> 01:05:52,815
GPS coordinates!

1094
01:05:53,357 --> 01:05:56,485
Gabe, for the last time,

1095
01:05:56,569 --> 01:06:02,324
there're more than 2,837 nice children.

1096
01:06:02,408 --> 01:06:03,409
Yeah!

1097
01:06:03,492 --> 01:06:07,621
However many presents there are,
we have no way to deliver them.

1098
01:06:07,705 --> 01:06:09,999
No, listen to me. I can do this.

1099
01:06:10,082 --> 01:06:13,836
We just need to do a reboot or maybe
get an appointment at the Genius bar.

1100
01:06:13,919 --> 01:06:16,130
Please, I can do it!

1101
01:06:19,216 --> 01:06:21,802
<i>Reports are filing in
from all over Phoenix</i>

1102
01:06:21,886 --> 01:06:26,932
<i>of emails denying children presents
and signed by Santa Claus.</i>

1103
01:06:27,016 --> 01:06:31,395
<i>Young Evelyn Ramirez received one
because she bites her fingernails.</i>

1104
01:06:31,479 --> 01:06:35,941
<i>Another boy was rejected
because of his failure to floss.</i>

1105
01:06:36,025 --> 01:06:39,403
<i>It seems like there's a real shortage
of Christmas spirit this year.</i>

1106
01:06:40,362 --> 01:06:43,657
<i>Hopefully, we'll have some more
cheerful stories for you soon.</i>

1107
01:06:44,575 --> 01:06:51,540
<i>Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho,
Merry Christmas!</i>

1108
01:06:58,005 --> 01:06:59,840
<i>There was a disturbing scene</i>

1109
01:06:59,924 --> 01:07:02,593
<i>at the Desert Ridge Marketplace today.</i>

1110
01:07:02,676 --> 01:07:04,762
<i>A hysterical woman...</i>

1111
01:07:26,909 --> 01:07:30,204
Listen, I know we can't hang
this Christmas,

1112
01:07:30,287 --> 01:07:32,289
but I got you something.

1113
01:07:39,588 --> 01:07:42,091
Thanks, Dad. This is great.

1114
01:07:42,591 --> 01:07:44,593
I know you told Noelle
you wanted me to come over

1115
01:07:44,677 --> 01:07:48,347
and do our traditional Sun Ming
red and green eggroll thing, but I just...

1116
01:07:48,430 --> 01:07:50,349
Dad, I never told Noelle that.

1117
01:07:50,850 --> 01:07:52,351
Well, then, how did she know?

1118
01:07:52,434 --> 01:07:55,354
She said I'd get what I wanted
for Christmas, but I never told her.

1119
01:07:55,437 --> 01:07:58,440
- Come on, Alex. That's ridiculous.
- Dad, it's true!

1120
01:08:09,785 --> 01:08:12,371
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1121
01:08:12,454 --> 01:08:13,914
Can I come in?

1122
01:08:13,998 --> 01:08:15,291
Sure, Aunt Polly.

1123
01:08:15,875 --> 01:08:16,876
Thank you.

1124
01:08:16,959 --> 01:08:19,420
Or should I say... Elf Polly?

1125
01:08:22,590 --> 01:08:23,799
Sit.

1126
01:08:34,101 --> 01:08:37,313
Now, I see she told you,

1127
01:08:37,396 --> 01:08:39,315
and I see that you don't believe her.

1128
01:08:39,398 --> 01:08:40,900
That she lives in the North Pole?

1129
01:08:42,234 --> 01:08:46,071
No. I tend to believe what I can see.

1130
01:08:47,114 --> 01:08:48,574
Well, if that's the only problem.

1131
01:08:49,450 --> 01:08:50,451
Oh!

1132
01:08:51,076 --> 01:08:52,620
You should get that looked at.

1133
01:08:54,788 --> 01:08:57,625
Let me ask you a question, Detective.

1134
01:08:57,708 --> 01:08:59,335
Can you see love?

1135
01:09:01,337 --> 01:09:03,047
Can you see sorrow?

1136
01:09:05,841 --> 01:09:07,551
Can you see joy?

1137
01:09:09,595 --> 01:09:12,056
Is there anything realer than that?

1138
01:09:13,057 --> 01:09:15,100
Like what you feel for your boy?

1139
01:09:35,788 --> 01:09:36,789
How can I help?

1140
01:09:37,665 --> 01:09:40,918
Get her out of that hospital,
and I will take care of the rest.

1141
01:09:43,379 --> 01:09:45,798
Why do you think
you're here today, Noelle?

1142
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:49,885
Because I kicked a policeman,

1143
01:09:49,969 --> 01:09:53,472
which isn't illegal where I'm from.
Because we don't have policeman.

1144
01:09:54,014 --> 01:09:55,099
I see.

1145
01:09:56,016 --> 01:09:57,476
And where are you from?

1146
01:09:59,478 --> 01:10:02,815
The North Pole, and my dad is Santa Claus,

1147
01:10:02,898 --> 01:10:06,026
and now my brother is Santa Claus.
You can start laughing now.

1148
01:10:06,819 --> 01:10:09,280
I'm not gonna laugh, Noelle.

1149
01:10:09,363 --> 01:10:12,449
I've dealt with many patients
who have unusual identities.

1150
01:10:12,825 --> 01:10:15,369
I treat a man who believes
he's the tooth fairy.

1151
01:10:17,163 --> 01:10:18,539
Well, that's ridiculous.

1152
01:10:18,831 --> 01:10:21,375
And a woman who's certain
she's Mother Nature.

1153
01:10:22,209 --> 01:10:24,879
Wow. Some real nuts out there.

1154
01:10:24,962 --> 01:10:28,716
And I have another patient who's convinced
he's Frosty the Snowman.

1155
01:10:28,924 --> 01:10:30,050
Frosty's here?

1156
01:10:31,218 --> 01:10:35,514
No, no. Come on. Nice try.
Frosty couldn't survive in Phoenix.

1157
01:10:35,598 --> 01:10:37,433
At home, he doesn't even go indoors.

1158
01:10:37,516 --> 01:10:39,518
He's terrified of fireplaces.

1159
01:10:40,060 --> 01:10:42,021
Drama queen. Miss that guy.

1160
01:10:45,149 --> 01:10:46,650
You know, the thing is,

1161
01:10:47,443 --> 01:10:50,696
I just thought this was my chance
to do something right.

1162
01:10:50,779 --> 01:10:54,533
You know? I wanted to prove
I'm not some spoiled princess

1163
01:10:54,617 --> 01:10:58,120
who just thinks about herself and writes
her silly cards all day, you know?

1164
01:10:59,663 --> 01:11:04,251
I always thought, eventually,
I'd do something important.

1165
01:11:07,796 --> 01:11:10,174
- Yes?
- Sorry to interrupt, Dr. Sussman,

1166
01:11:10,257 --> 01:11:13,511
but I need Miss Kringle
on official police business for a second.

1167
01:11:14,803 --> 01:11:15,888
That's fine.

1168
01:11:21,936 --> 01:11:24,647
Right outside if you need me,
Jake. You got two minutes.

1169
01:11:32,738 --> 01:11:36,408
Look, I don't know how you knew
about me and Alex,

1170
01:11:36,492 --> 01:11:39,578
- and our red and green eggroll tradition.
- I shouldn't have interfered.

1171
01:11:39,662 --> 01:11:42,581
You know, but you made him happy.
And you made me...

1172
01:11:42,665 --> 01:11:44,083
Deliriously joyful.

1173
01:11:45,376 --> 01:11:47,628
Laugh... mostly at you.

1174
01:11:48,379 --> 01:11:50,756
Which still makes it my best Christmas
in a long time.

1175
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:53,884
So, when Polly came to see me
about getting you out of here...

1176
01:11:53,968 --> 01:11:55,886
Wait, so you believe what I told you?

1177
01:11:56,512 --> 01:11:59,390
I believe that you believe.

1178
01:12:00,099 --> 01:12:02,560
But to get out of here,
stop talking about the North Pole,

1179
01:12:02,643 --> 01:12:03,894
and Santa Claus.

1180
01:12:03,978 --> 01:12:05,479
- Yeah. And sleighs.
- And sleighs.

1181
01:12:05,563 --> 01:12:06,730
Oh!

1182
01:12:07,648 --> 01:12:08,941
What? What?

1183
01:12:11,110 --> 01:12:14,405
Oh, the sleigh. You've seen it before.
You saw it at the mall.

1184
01:12:14,488 --> 01:12:17,992
You haven't seen it hovering
11 stories up, that's the only difference.

1185
01:12:20,619 --> 01:12:21,704
You okay?

1186
01:12:22,037 --> 01:12:25,624
Miss Kringle, I think that
we should resume and... Oh!

1187
01:12:25,708 --> 01:12:27,501
- Hi.
- Hi.

1188
01:12:27,585 --> 01:12:29,503
That's unusual.

1189
01:12:35,885 --> 01:12:39,013
Jake? It's Clara. Open up.

1190
01:12:39,096 --> 01:12:40,347
Quick, get in your...

1191
01:12:40,431 --> 01:12:41,599
- Sleigh, yeah.
- Sleigh.

1192
01:12:43,017 --> 01:12:45,769
You're not a total loser.
You're a nice person.

1193
01:12:45,853 --> 01:12:47,354
And a wonderful dad.

1194
01:12:47,730 --> 01:12:49,440
And you're very generous with sunblock.

1195
01:12:49,857 --> 01:12:51,317
Jake? Open up.

1196
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:52,735
- Just go!
- Yeah.

1197
01:12:54,361 --> 01:12:55,362
Come on.

1198
01:12:55,779 --> 01:12:56,947
Careful.

1199
01:12:57,031 --> 01:12:58,199
- Oh, boy.
- Okay.

1200
01:12:58,282 --> 01:13:00,451
- Bye.
- Okay, let's go.

1201
01:13:01,660 --> 01:13:04,914
- Whoa! I'm not good at this!
- Yes, yes you are.

1202
01:13:10,628 --> 01:13:17,593
<i>I'll have a Blue Christmas without you</i>

1203
01:13:18,302 --> 01:13:19,512
We miss you, Santa.

1204
01:13:19,595 --> 01:13:26,352
<i>I'll be so blue
just thinking about you</i>

1205
01:13:26,435 --> 01:13:28,813
Candy just doesn't taste the same
without you, Santa.

1206
01:13:28,896 --> 01:13:33,484
<i>Decorations of red</i>

1207
01:13:33,567 --> 01:13:38,030
<i>On a green Christmas tree</i>

1208
01:13:38,531 --> 01:13:42,201
<i>Won't be the same, dear</i>

1209
01:13:42,284 --> 01:13:44,745
<i>If you're not here with me</i>

1210
01:13:44,829 --> 01:13:47,581
Just come back, we got
the milk and cookies for you, Santa.

1211
01:13:47,665 --> 01:13:52,211
<i>And when those blue memories start calling</i>

1212
01:13:52,294 --> 01:13:54,630
Snowball fights, the Coco. All the fun.

1213
01:13:54,713 --> 01:13:56,298
<i>You'll be...</i>

1214
01:13:56,382 --> 01:13:58,217
Santa's back!

1215
01:13:59,677 --> 01:14:00,678
Ooh!

1216
01:14:01,929 --> 01:14:05,099
My children are home!

1217
01:14:06,642 --> 01:14:10,104
I missed you! Oh, my goodness!

1218
01:14:10,187 --> 01:14:13,149
You did it, Noelle. Polly!

1219
01:14:13,691 --> 01:14:15,025
Uh...

1220
01:14:16,193 --> 01:14:21,448
I... I know I let you all down,

1221
01:14:22,825 --> 01:14:25,286
but while I was away, I...

1222
01:14:26,370 --> 01:14:28,539
I learned what it takes to be Santa.

1223
01:14:29,081 --> 01:14:31,667
It's about understanding people,
and, uh...

1224
01:14:33,002 --> 01:14:36,422
and really listening
to what they have to say.

1225
01:14:36,505 --> 01:14:37,506
And, um...

1226
01:14:39,758 --> 01:14:41,886
And just making everyone feel jolly.

1227
01:14:43,637 --> 01:14:48,184
Which is why I know that we have
a real Santa right here in the Pole.

1228
01:14:48,267 --> 01:14:49,268
Yes!

1229
01:14:52,646 --> 01:14:54,356
My sister, Noelle.

1230
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:56,025
- What?
- What did he say?

1231
01:14:56,108 --> 01:14:57,276
Did he say "Noelle?"

1232
01:15:01,197 --> 01:15:03,949
Nick. I appreciate the gesture,
but what are you doing?

1233
01:15:04,033 --> 01:15:05,701
That's why I came home, you know.

1234
01:15:05,784 --> 01:15:07,745
The minute I saw you with those kids,
I knew.

1235
01:15:07,828 --> 01:15:10,831
No. Okay. Maybe I inherited a couple
of Dad's powers,

1236
01:15:10,915 --> 01:15:13,000
- but what...
- You have The Twinkle, Ellie.

1237
01:15:13,083 --> 01:15:15,836
A girl? Santa's not a girl!

1238
01:15:16,712 --> 01:15:17,713
Whoa!

1239
01:15:21,926 --> 01:15:25,554
Silent... night!

1240
01:15:31,894 --> 01:15:34,146
I rechecked the Christmas covenant.

1241
01:15:34,730 --> 01:15:39,026
And it turns out there's nothing there
that says a woman can't be Santa.

1242
01:15:39,652 --> 01:15:40,778
See?

1243
01:15:41,278 --> 01:15:45,658
It's just a tradition we've been
blindly following for thousands of years.

1244
01:15:45,991 --> 01:15:48,494
- These things happen.
- Oh, man!

1245
01:15:48,577 --> 01:15:52,998
The question is,
what really makes a Santa?

1246
01:15:53,082 --> 01:15:58,796
Ultimately, the one thing all Santas share
is the ability to inspire us

1247
01:15:58,879 --> 01:16:00,756
with the Christmas spirit.

1248
01:16:02,466 --> 01:16:05,511
Noelle, can you inspire us?

1249
01:16:05,970 --> 01:16:07,763
What does Christmas mean to you?

1250
01:16:26,407 --> 01:16:29,285
I used to think Christmas
was the best day of the year.

1251
01:16:29,368 --> 01:16:31,287
Presents and caroling.

1252
01:16:33,247 --> 01:16:36,000
But I met people for whom
it isn't the best day

1253
01:16:36,083 --> 01:16:41,505
because it reminds them they don't have
enough food to eat or a place to live.

1254
01:16:41,881 --> 01:16:43,841
Or maybe even someone
to share the day with.

1255
01:16:45,301 --> 01:16:47,219
And it got me thinking.

1256
01:16:48,262 --> 01:16:51,182
For thousands of years,
we've jingled bells and delivered toys,

1257
01:16:51,265 --> 01:16:55,394
and the world just gets more awful
and miserable. So what's the point?

1258
01:16:58,105 --> 01:17:03,152
But I also met a girl at a shelter
who drew these beautiful pictures,

1259
01:17:03,235 --> 01:17:06,113
and her Christmas wish wasn't for herself.

1260
01:17:06,197 --> 01:17:09,950
It was for her mother
to be able to find a job.

1261
01:17:10,743 --> 01:17:12,828
And I met a woman at a marketplace

1262
01:17:12,912 --> 01:17:16,290
who worked so hard to fill Christmas
with fun and music,

1263
01:17:16,373 --> 01:17:19,126
even though she knew she might not have
anyone to spend it with.

1264
01:17:21,212 --> 01:17:25,966
And I met this sweet, wonderful boy
who has this big heart.

1265
01:17:26,050 --> 01:17:27,468
And his father

1266
01:17:27,551 --> 01:17:30,930
who doesn't even believe in Christmas,
but made sure we could be home for it.

1267
01:17:34,141 --> 01:17:39,563
We have this list of nice people
from Hong Kong to Houston

1268
01:17:39,647 --> 01:17:41,607
doing wonderful, selfless things.

1269
01:17:44,485 --> 01:17:47,404
And I know Christmas
can't solve all our problems.

1270
01:17:49,573 --> 01:17:50,699
But it gives us hope.

1271
01:17:52,368 --> 01:17:54,286
It inspires us to be nice.

1272
01:17:54,912 --> 01:17:56,831
That might not seem like much, but...

1273
01:17:58,833 --> 01:18:01,544
when someone's sad or just lonely,

1274
01:18:02,294 --> 01:18:04,129
it can be the biggest thing in the world.

1275
01:18:05,673 --> 01:18:08,217
And presents are part of it.

1276
01:18:08,634 --> 01:18:10,761
I like presents as much as anybody.

1277
01:18:13,472 --> 01:18:14,473
Okay, more.

1278
01:18:16,100 --> 01:18:17,351
Oh, yeah, that's true.

1279
01:18:18,519 --> 01:18:22,106
But now, I think it's not just about
the presents we get.

1280
01:18:22,189 --> 01:18:24,233
It's about the presents we give.

1281
01:18:25,442 --> 01:18:27,570
The presents of love and understanding.

1282
01:18:36,954 --> 01:18:38,122
And also, iPads.

1283
01:18:43,210 --> 01:18:44,336
My little girl.

1284
01:18:46,088 --> 01:18:47,923
Looks like we got a Santa, guys!

1285
01:18:48,007 --> 01:18:50,009
Yeah, finally!

1286
01:18:58,893 --> 01:19:02,771
Ho, ho, ho.

1287
01:19:03,105 --> 01:19:07,151
If a child wakes up, try to coax them
gently back to sleep.

1288
01:19:26,420 --> 01:19:30,925
I want everyone
to double-check everything.

1289
01:19:31,467 --> 01:19:32,468
Mother.

1290
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:35,721
Um...

1291
01:19:36,472 --> 01:19:38,432
I'm not sure about this.

1292
01:19:39,934 --> 01:19:43,604
You know how it works.
It fits you when you fit it.

1293
01:19:46,065 --> 01:19:48,651
Sweetie, you have nothing
to be nervous about.

1294
01:19:48,734 --> 01:19:51,487
Um, son,
why don't we go check the reindeer?

1295
01:19:51,570 --> 01:19:52,863
The reindeer? They have ticks.

1296
01:19:52,947 --> 01:19:54,114
- That's... Come on.
- It's not...

1297
01:19:54,198 --> 01:19:55,199
- Let's just go.
- No.

1298
01:19:55,282 --> 01:19:56,283
Come on. Go.

1299
01:20:01,038 --> 01:20:04,875
What're you doing? You know
Santa has to fly solo on Christmas Eve.

1300
01:20:05,292 --> 01:20:08,671
Force of habit.
Once a nanny, always a nanny.

1301
01:20:08,754 --> 01:20:10,172
Elf Polly.

1302
01:20:10,714 --> 01:20:11,715
Yes?

1303
01:20:12,925 --> 01:20:14,593
I don't know if I'm ready, Polly.

1304
01:20:16,637 --> 01:20:19,932
You know what I'm really scared of?
Some kid's gonna wake up, look at me,

1305
01:20:20,015 --> 01:20:23,185
and say, "You're not Santa."

1306
01:20:25,187 --> 01:20:28,357
From the first moment
that I held you in my arms,

1307
01:20:29,191 --> 01:20:32,862
I could see something in your eyes,
and I said to myself,

1308
01:20:33,737 --> 01:20:35,865
"This girl has The Twinkle."

1309
01:20:39,535 --> 01:20:40,786
You're ready.

1310
01:20:42,621 --> 01:20:43,622
Oh!

1311
01:20:44,957 --> 01:20:46,542
Pull yourself together.

1312
01:21:04,226 --> 01:21:06,145
Wait. Someone's missing.

1313
01:21:17,072 --> 01:21:19,533
Dude, this is supposed to be our song,
come on!

1314
01:21:28,209 --> 01:21:30,544
Okay, Snowy.
I need all the help I can get.

1315
01:21:31,003 --> 01:21:32,338
You're my guy, right?

1316
01:21:34,131 --> 01:21:35,132
Fly straight?

1317
01:21:46,852 --> 01:21:48,354
You're facing the wrong way.

1318
01:21:50,564 --> 01:21:52,233
I'm really glad it's not me.

1319
01:22:04,328 --> 01:22:05,329
On Snowcone!

1320
01:22:34,775 --> 01:22:36,277
Puffins, scatter!

1321
01:22:59,633 --> 01:23:02,344
No! Snowy! Snow...

1322
01:23:08,726 --> 01:23:09,894
All right.

1323
01:23:14,064 --> 01:23:16,150
<i>We wish you a merry Christmas
We...</i>

1324
01:23:58,859 --> 01:23:59,944
Did we miss Greece?

1325
01:24:33,394 --> 01:24:34,812
We're Jewish.

1326
01:24:55,749 --> 01:24:57,042
I'm sorry, Dad.

1327
01:26:02,817 --> 01:26:06,195
No, no, no, no.
Sorry, sorry, sorry. Go back to sleep.

1328
01:26:06,737 --> 01:26:08,197
- Seriously. Go back to... Oh!
- Ow!

1329
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:10,407
Ma'am, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1330
01:26:10,491 --> 01:26:13,619
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
No. Go back to sleep!

1331
01:26:20,751 --> 01:26:21,752
Hi.

1332
01:26:25,464 --> 01:26:29,218
She says, "Merry Christmas, Santa."

1333
01:26:31,095 --> 01:26:32,179
Santa?

1334
01:26:36,183 --> 01:26:37,601
Thank you, Michelle.

1335
01:26:38,853 --> 01:26:40,187
I needed that.

1336
01:26:41,105 --> 01:26:44,108
Now you go to sleep. Okay?

1337
01:26:50,322 --> 01:26:52,908
- Merry Christmas, Santa.
- Merry Christmas.

1338
01:26:52,992 --> 01:26:54,577
Merry Christmas, Santa.

1339
01:26:55,119 --> 01:26:56,453
Merry Christmas.

1340
01:26:57,288 --> 01:26:58,998
Merry Christmas.

1341
01:26:59,081 --> 01:27:01,208
Go to sleep. You go to sleep.

1342
01:27:31,614 --> 01:27:34,325
<i>Sometimes, all you need
is a nice word from a friend</i>

1343
01:27:34,408 --> 01:27:36,744
<i>to make you feel comfortable
in your own boots.</i>

1344
01:27:37,536 --> 01:27:40,414
<i>But once that happened,
I was ready to go to work.</i>

1345
01:27:41,665 --> 01:27:42,833
<i>I went back to Greece,</i>

1346
01:27:43,417 --> 01:27:46,170
<i>and visited a few other places I'd missed,</i>

1347
01:27:46,253 --> 01:27:49,924
<i>and then I made sure to keep a promise
I'd made to Alex.</i>

1348
01:27:55,095 --> 01:27:56,680
Oh, wow.

1349
01:27:57,765 --> 01:27:58,891
Your stop, I believe.

1350
01:27:58,974 --> 01:28:02,645
Yeah. Aren't you supposed to bring Alex
a Christmas present or something?

1351
01:28:03,312 --> 01:28:06,023
I did. He's sitting right next to me.

1352
01:28:06,941 --> 01:28:08,567
I don't know if this is a great idea.

1353
01:28:08,651 --> 01:28:10,820
I don't want my ex
and her husband to feel weird.

1354
01:28:11,737 --> 01:28:14,615
Traditions change. Right?

1355
01:28:17,076 --> 01:28:18,327
The new ones are scary.

1356
01:28:19,745 --> 01:28:20,955
But they might be great.

1357
01:28:21,664 --> 01:28:23,833
And if you know
what Christmas means to you,

1358
01:28:24,458 --> 01:28:26,252
the tradition's just the wrapping.

1359
01:28:28,003 --> 01:28:30,256
Christmas means spending time with Alex.

1360
01:28:32,091 --> 01:28:33,592
There you go.

1361
01:28:33,676 --> 01:28:35,928
That's jolly! Okay! Now get in there.

1362
01:28:36,011 --> 01:28:37,805
I'm serious. You get one ride. Get out.

1363
01:28:37,888 --> 01:28:39,014
- Go.
- Okay.

1364
01:28:39,098 --> 01:28:41,433
- Very busy. Very busy woman.
- Pushy Santa.

1365
01:28:41,851 --> 01:28:43,435
So, will I see you again?

1366
01:28:45,020 --> 01:28:46,605
Every December 24th.

1367
01:28:49,233 --> 01:28:50,568
I don't know what that is.

1368
01:28:50,651 --> 01:28:52,903
It's what you do when you think
someone's awesome.

1369
01:28:53,195 --> 01:28:55,573
Aw. Well...

1370
01:28:58,325 --> 01:28:59,827
- All right.
- Oh, right.

1371
01:29:00,327 --> 01:29:01,495
Got it.

1372
01:29:01,996 --> 01:29:03,038
Okay.

1373
01:29:03,539 --> 01:29:05,416
On Snowcone!

1374
01:29:07,668 --> 01:29:10,462
Merry Christmas!

1375
01:29:10,546 --> 01:29:12,173
Man, that's fun to say!

1376
01:29:12,631 --> 01:29:15,759
<i>I was so happy that Jake
got to see Alex for Christmas.</i>

1377
01:29:15,843 --> 01:29:17,261
- Merry Christmas!
- Dad!

1378
01:29:20,306 --> 01:29:21,307
I knew you'd come.

1379
01:29:22,933 --> 01:29:24,894
<i>And Helen finally got her vacation.</i>

1380
01:29:30,774 --> 01:29:32,234
<i>And when Michelle and her mom</i>

1381
01:29:32,318 --> 01:29:34,904
<i>woke up the next morning,
they found a present under the tree</i>

1382
01:29:34,987 --> 01:29:36,947
<i>with a job listing
at a school for the deaf.</i>

1383
01:29:37,031 --> 01:29:39,116
<i>Oh, and an iPad. Obviously.</i>

1384
01:29:42,203 --> 01:29:45,915
<i>Dad always said you never forget
your first Christmas as Santa.</i>

1385
01:29:45,998 --> 01:29:47,249
<i>Okay, he said it to Nick,</i>

1386
01:29:47,333 --> 01:29:50,002
<i>but I overheard it,
and oh, my garland, was he right!</i>

1387
01:29:50,628 --> 01:29:52,463
<i>I hoped he'd be proud of me.</i>

1388
01:29:52,546 --> 01:29:57,218
<i>And I hoped everyone at home had
come around to the idea of a girl Santa.</i>

1389
01:30:01,347 --> 01:30:03,057
Look, Santa's back!

1390
01:30:03,224 --> 01:30:05,392
<i>Turns out, I didn't have to worry.</i>

1391
01:30:05,476 --> 01:30:06,602
Santa Noelle!

1392
01:30:06,685 --> 01:30:09,063
Merry Christmas, Santa Noelle!

1393
01:30:13,442 --> 01:30:16,237
Well, guess who came to town!

1394
01:30:18,656 --> 01:30:21,283
- <i>Namaste,</i> sis.
- Um, <i>Namaste.</i>

1395
01:30:22,076 --> 01:30:23,577
Congratulations, Santa.

1396
01:30:23,994 --> 01:30:27,039
<i>Now that I was the 24th Kringle
to wear the red hat,</i>

1397
01:30:28,290 --> 01:30:31,001
<i>I had a couple small changes
I wanted to make.</i>

1398
01:30:32,545 --> 01:30:34,755
<i>We opened the first yoga studio
in the Pole.</i>

1399
01:30:34,839 --> 01:30:36,799
Sorry.

1400
01:30:36,882 --> 01:30:38,926
<i>I made Polly the first female elder elf.</i>

1401
01:30:39,009 --> 01:30:42,972
Hey! Get out of my garden, now! Go!

1402
01:30:43,055 --> 01:30:44,431
<i>Which I slightly regret.</i>

1403
01:30:44,515 --> 01:30:47,143
These are high-intensity
infrared Santa goggles

1404
01:30:47,226 --> 01:30:49,812
which allow you to detect any lasers
between you and a tree.

1405
01:30:49,895 --> 01:30:53,315
Very impressive. Have we come up with
anything to deal with big, mean dogs?

1406
01:30:53,399 --> 01:30:54,650
Just this bone.

1407
01:30:54,733 --> 01:30:56,026
Okay. Keep working.

1408
01:30:56,110 --> 01:31:00,114
<i>And as for me,
I mean, I'm Santa. It's great!</i>

1409
01:31:00,489 --> 01:31:02,158
- Keep it coming.
- Thanks, Santa.

1410
01:31:02,241 --> 01:31:03,742
Thank you very much.

1411
01:31:03,826 --> 01:31:05,953
Okay, a letter from
Jake and Alex, everybody.

1412
01:31:06,036 --> 01:31:08,038
Alex is into music now,

1413
01:31:08,122 --> 01:31:10,374
so a slow cooker is out
and drum kit is in.

1414
01:31:10,457 --> 01:31:13,377
And throw in a pair of noise-cancelling
headphones for dad. Great.

1415
01:31:17,548 --> 01:31:18,966
<i>When I was a little girl,</i>

1416
01:31:19,049 --> 01:31:21,260
<i>Christmas Eve was always
the best night of the year.</i>

1417
01:31:22,887 --> 01:31:25,264
<i>But this time, it was better than ever.</i>

1418
01:31:26,599 --> 01:31:28,809
<i>Because instead of getting the presents,</i>

1419
01:31:29,393 --> 01:31:31,061
<i>I was giving them.</i>

1420
01:31:37,030 --> 01:31:42,030
