the thumb and the finger one at a time.

00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:01,542
But don't get any wrong ideas.

353
00:25:01,584 --> 00:25:03,424
They may be girls, but they're rugged.

354
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:05,546
For space flight, they had to be.

355
00:25:06,756 --> 00:25:10,086
Space flight? You mean, these poor
little things were sent up in rockets?

356
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:13,636
Don't get excited. They lost their jobs
before they ever made it.

357
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:16,353
The Air Force is
sending up men nowadays.

358
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:19,016
I'm happy for that.

359
00:25:23,773 --> 00:25:25,273
You will keep them here, <i>monsieur?</i>

360
00:25:25,316 --> 00:25:26,356
Yeah. That's the idea.

361
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:28,072
May I help you with them?

362
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,610
Oh, no, No.

363
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:31,025
Thanks. We'll do fine.

364
00:25:31,322 --> 00:25:33,952
Please, <i>monsieur.</i>
I will be like a mother to them.

365
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:35,238
You'd just spoil 'em.

366
00:25:35,368 --> 00:25:37,748
Look. You see how
she takes to me already?

367
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:40,891
Give 'em too much affection,
they'll walk all over you.

368
00:25:40,915 --> 00:25:43,785
But no one ever has
too much love, <i>monsieur.</i>

369
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:45,586
Well, that's true.

370
00:25:45,628 --> 00:25:48,968
Wait a minute, now look, I have put a lot
of time and effort into their education.

371
00:25:49,632 --> 00:25:51,182
I'm not about to goof it up.

372
00:25:51,842 --> 00:25:54,762
But <i>monsieur,</i> I would
make them the cutest little outfits...

373
00:25:54,804 --> 00:25:58,104
Now, that is exactly
the kind of help I don't want.

374
00:25:58,391 --> 00:26:01,941
These are not dolls you play with.
They're chimpanzees.

375
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:04,771
As such, they have dignity
and they have rights.

376
00:26:04,814 --> 00:26:07,125
I'm not about to let somebody come in
and turn them into clowns,

377
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:09,795
or glamour girls, or anything except
plain, simple, hard working chimps,

378
00:26:09,819 --> 00:26:10,859
you understand?

379
00:26:10,945 --> 00:26:12,605
<i>- Oui, monsieur.</i>
- All right.

380
00:26:12,655 --> 00:26:15,485
But, I was just thinking, you know,
the sun is very hot,

381
00:26:15,825 --> 00:26:17,655
and if they had little bonnets

382
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,590
when I take them walking in the village...

383
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,620
Stop right there.

384
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:23,998
The village is absolutely
out of bounds. Absolutely.

385
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,173
But why?

386
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:28,169
Come here.

387
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:41,927
- Can you keep a secret?
- Oh, but of course.

388
00:26:42,018 --> 00:26:43,745
All right, you're the only one
who knows about 'em.

389
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:45,059
- I am?
- Yeah, yeah.

390
00:26:45,146 --> 00:26:46,356
So I'm sort of in your power.

391
00:26:46,397 --> 00:26:47,397
You are what?

392
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:49,818
Uh, never mind. Look...

393
00:26:50,401 --> 00:26:53,361
I am going to teach these monkeys
how to pick olives.

394
00:26:53,696 --> 00:26:55,446
- To pick olives?
- Yes.

395
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:57,451
- How clever, <i>monsieur.</i>
- Yeah, yeah.

396
00:26:58,576 --> 00:27:01,496
Now look, if I let you
help me with the training,

397
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:03,037
will you promise not to tell anybody?

398
00:27:03,414 --> 00:27:05,714
- Oh, yes. I will not tell a soul.
- Okay.

399
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,840
But why must I not tell a soul?

400
00:27:08,044 --> 00:27:11,014
Well, I don't want kids
and sightseers coming up here

401
00:27:11,047 --> 00:27:13,066
and fouling up discipline and training.
You understand?

402
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:14,090
<i>Oui, monsieur.</i>

403
00:27:14,175 --> 00:27:15,736
All right. Now don't even
tell your own family.

404
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,220
Not even Mama will I tell.

405
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:18,845
Okay.

406
00:27:19,055 --> 00:27:21,765
It's just yours and mine... Our secret.

407
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:23,229
You and me, huh?

408
00:27:27,605 --> 00:27:30,225
I'd better be going now.

409
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:34,985
Oh, <i>monsieur,</i>
I've started working again,

410
00:27:35,071 --> 00:27:36,821
at the perfume factory, in Grasse.

411
00:27:36,906 --> 00:27:39,946
So I can only come to help you
in the evenings, and on weekends.

412
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:41,294
Will that be all right?

413
00:27:41,369 --> 00:27:44,579
Only evenings... It'll be fine, yes.

414
00:27:44,622 --> 00:27:45,622
<i>Au revoir, monsieur.</i>

415
00:27:45,706 --> 00:27:48,496
<i>Au revoir</i>. And remember. Shh.

416
00:27:49,085 --> 00:27:50,085
Shh.

417
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:08,401
<i>Merci beaucoup, monsieur.</i>

418
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:09,479
You're welcome.

419
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,230
<i>Monsieur</i> Terradouren.

420
00:28:52,606 --> 00:28:55,476
That is the second stalk of bananas
the American has bought this week.

421
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:56,648
<i>Oui.</i>

422
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:58,607
What does he do with
all those bananas?

423
00:28:58,654 --> 00:29:01,034
What does he do?
He eats them. What else?

424
00:29:01,115 --> 00:29:03,275
For one man, that is a lot of fruit.

425
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:05,037
Perhaps he is a vegetarian.

426
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:09,039
Whatever he is, it is good for business.

427
00:29:15,171 --> 00:29:16,841
A strange man, huh?

428
00:29:16,881 --> 00:29:19,051
<i>Oui</i>. Even for an American.

429
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:21,796
You're certain he's married?

430
00:29:21,844 --> 00:29:23,474
Ah, I did not say that.

431
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:25,852
But you did speak of a room for children.

432
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:29,140
I see. You are worried about Maria.

433
00:29:29,602 --> 00:29:31,812
Yes. She's young and innocent.

434
00:29:32,313 --> 00:29:34,443
Her head could be turned
by this foreigner.

435
00:29:34,857 --> 00:29:35,897

436
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:38,566
Something is funny?

437
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:41,282
No, no, no. I was just thinking.

438
00:29:41,822 --> 00:29:45,792
A big red-blooded butcher like you,
afraid of a vegetarian.

439
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:46,948
(LAUGHS)

440
00:29:47,036 --> 00:29:51,326
That is a funny thing.
That is a very, very funny thing.

442
00:29:56,962 --> 00:30:00,762
Maria. Hey, come on. Time's a wastin'.

443
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:02,680
Here we are.

444
00:30:03,803 --> 00:30:05,143
Oh, no.

445
00:30:05,638 --> 00:30:06,968
Aren't they sweet?

446
00:30:07,515 --> 00:30:09,095
No. They look ridiculous.

447
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:14,057
Maria, didn't I tell you
they were working chimps?

448
00:30:14,104 --> 00:30:16,574
<i>Oui, monsieur,</i> but they are girls,
and they have feelings.

449
00:30:17,525 --> 00:30:19,855
To a girl appearance is most important.

450
00:30:19,944 --> 00:30:21,404
Especially chimpanzees.

451
00:30:21,654 --> 00:30:23,574
Well, we'll just see about that.
Come on girls...

452
00:30:23,614 --> 00:30:26,084
We're gonna take up the lesson
where we left off yesterday.

453
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,700
Keep in mind rule number one,
we do not eat the olives.

454
00:30:35,918 --> 00:30:37,458
Okay, Monique, you're first.

455
00:30:39,255 --> 00:30:41,835
Okay. Pick 'em up.

456
00:30:43,259 --> 00:30:44,259
Good.

457
00:30:44,885 --> 00:30:47,595
Nice going, Monique,
you haven't forgotten a thing,

458
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,270
in spite of the silly work clothes.

459
00:30:54,395 --> 00:30:56,855
Here, Monique.
This is for being a good girl.

Simply marvelous.

Now I know what is meant
by "American enterprise."

Do you realize they could revolutionize
the entire olive industry?

490
00:32:58,352 --> 00:33:02,232
Can you not see these little ladies
in every orchard in Provence?

a corner on the olive market. Eh?

it is not because of their nightgowns.

599

Without causes,
they have no need for slogans.

man has been using animals
to ease his burden.

626
00:40:02,818 --> 00:40:05,528
Yeah, that's right. Like the horse
and the chicken and the cow.

for tasks he cannot do himself.

The Bible says God
created the animals for...

Don't try to confuse us with theology.

634
00:40:23,672 --> 00:40:27,262
When you train monkeys to do
a man's work you create unemployment.

What will become of us
when your monkey army takes over?

- Answer me that!
- Monkey...

By that time,
you'll be hanging in the deep freeze

638
00:40:34,808 --> 00:40:37,098
and pigs'll be running this butcher shop.

639
00:40:37,561 --> 00:40:38,981
That's a stupid statement.

640
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:43,017

a horse pull a cart because a man can't.

That's not stupid, that's a fact!

642
00:40:45,068 --> 00:40:48,908
A-ha! Then a horse
is putting six men out of work,

643
00:40:48,989 --> 00:40:52,279

very easily pull a wagon. Ha ha.

00:56:47,238 --> 00:56:49,618
Anyone would be an idiot
to turn down such a deal.

879
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:52,660
I have 250 trees
and I will go with Dussard.

880
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:56,370
<i>Oui, oui!</i> And I have 100 trees!

Gregoire. Tartarin. Maindou.

882
00:57:00,042 --> 00:57:01,502
- It worked!
- Thank you, Father.

883
00:57:01,544 --> 00:57:02,634
Oh, good.

884
00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:06,920
Are you blind to reason? Do you think
you'll see even one franc of profit?

885
00:57:07,425 --> 00:57:08,625
This is a fraud!

886
00:57:08,676 --> 00:57:10,296
A shameless exploitation!

887
00:57:11,303 --> 00:57:14,563
As your chairman I forbid you
to use monkey labor!

888
00:57:15,099 --> 00:57:17,519
Listen to your leaders
before it is too late!

889
00:57:17,852 --> 00:57:20,812
Before the American robs you
of everything you own.

890
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:36,870
Relax.

891
00:57:37,621 --> 00:57:39,461
Uh, everything's going to be okay.

892
00:57:39,582 --> 00:57:41,542
<i>Merci, monsieur. Merci.</i>

893
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:42,955
So long.

894
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:47,880
Hello, <i>monsieur.</i>

895
00:57:48,716 --> 00:57:49,716
Oh, hi.

896
00:57:50,718 --> 00:57:52,758
That was a wonderful thing to do,
<i>monsieur.</i>

897
00:57:52,845 --> 00:57:53,845
Mmm?

898
00:57:54,472 --> 00:57:56,722
Offering your monkeys to pick olives.

899
00:57:56,891 --> 00:57:59,311
Oh. Oh, yeah! That.

900
00:57:59,393 --> 00:58:01,563
It was a very patriotic thing, <i>monsieur.</i>

901
00:58:01,645 --> 00:58:02,706
Yeah, well, I lost my head.

902
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:04,374
You know, I could have probably
rented those monkeys out

903
00:58:04,398 --> 00:58:05,728
and made a small fortune.

904
00:58:06,066 --> 00:58:07,106
That's just what I mean.

905
00:58:07,193 --> 00:58:09,153
It was a most unselfish gesture.

906
00:58:10,321 --> 00:58:11,571
How are the monkeys?

907
00:58:11,739 --> 00:58:12,739
Oh, fine. Fine.

908
00:58:13,657 --> 00:58:14,737
You know, I've missed them.

909
00:58:16,535 --> 00:58:18,495
Well they've, uh, missed you, too.

910
00:58:19,622 --> 00:58:21,252
Did you leave them home alone?

911
00:58:21,707 --> 00:58:23,037
Yeah, the door's locked.

912
00:58:23,083 --> 00:58:24,883
Prowlers can't get in.
They can't get out.

913
00:58:25,377 --> 00:58:27,337
Well, I'm sure <i>monsieur</i> knows best.

914
00:58:28,214 --> 00:58:29,224
Hank.

915
00:58:29,673 --> 00:58:30,673

917
00:58:36,096 --> 00:58:37,596
Would you not like to dance?

918
00:58:37,932 --> 00:58:39,272
Yeah, why not.

920
00:59:22,101 --> 00:59:23,141

<i>Bonsoir,</i> Henri.

922
00:59:24,728 --> 00:59:27,148
<i>- Bonsoir,</i> Father.
- Enjoy yourself.

923
00:59:27,565 --> 00:59:29,775
- It's past my bedtime, now.
- Sleep well.

924
00:59:29,817 --> 00:59:31,317
- Good night.
- Good night.

925
00:59:40,661 --> 00:59:41,661
<i>Bonsoir,</i> Marcel.

926
00:59:41,912 --> 00:59:43,912
- Where have you been?
- To Cannes.

927
00:59:43,998 --> 00:59:45,328
The world falls apart

928
00:59:45,374 --> 00:59:47,644
and you are enjoying yourself
in the playground of the rich.

929
00:59:47,668 --> 00:59:50,418
I was in Cannes for business, Marcel.

930
00:59:51,171 --> 00:59:54,301
Now calm yourself
and tell me what's wrong.

931
00:59:54,883 --> 00:59:56,303
Piastillio betrayed us.

932
00:59:56,594 --> 00:59:57,974
He made a deal with the monkeys.

933
00:59:58,012 --> 01:00:00,932
Ah, then it was too bad that I was away!

934
01:00:01,015 --> 01:00:03,925
Even you couldn't have prevailed
against five francs a measure.

935
01:00:04,768 --> 01:00:07,558
Now, now, my friend.
All is not yet lost.

936
01:00:07,938 --> 01:00:10,858
While you were letting
things get out of hand,

937
01:00:11,025 --> 01:00:13,815
I was making certain arrangements.

938
01:00:14,028 --> 01:00:17,698
Certain legal arrangements
that will pluck this American

939
01:00:17,781 --> 01:00:20,201
from our beloved soil from the roots

940
01:00:20,409 --> 01:00:22,409
and destroy him forever.

941
01:00:53,233 --> 01:00:54,233
Is something wrong?

942
01:00:54,693 --> 01:00:55,693
My lights are on.

943
01:00:56,445 --> 01:00:57,765
Could've sworn I turned them off.

944
01:00:58,906 --> 01:01:00,196
Let's go see the monkeys.

945
01:01:00,616 --> 01:01:02,406
Oh, no, no. It's too late.

946
01:01:03,702 --> 01:01:05,252
Hey, come back here!

947
01:01:05,829 --> 01:01:07,549
- Where are you going?
- To see the monkeys!

948
01:01:07,581 --> 01:01:09,171
Oh, no you're not!

949
01:01:09,458 --> 01:01:11,394
Look, your mother will be worried,
it's after midnight.

950
01:01:11,418 --> 01:01:13,418
Mama is asleep,
so how can she worry? Come on.

951
01:01:13,462 --> 01:01:14,462
No!

952
01:01:16,215 --> 01:01:17,215
Please?

953
01:01:19,093 --> 01:01:20,263
I said no!

954
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:31,230
Why did you kiss me?

955
01:01:33,941 --> 01:01:35,401
When a man kisses a woman,

956
01:01:35,567 --> 01:01:36,857
does it not mean something?

957
01:01:37,569 --> 01:01:38,569
Yeah.

958
01:01:39,613 --> 01:01:41,243
I'm a man and you're a woman.

959
01:01:43,158 --> 01:01:44,278
Is that all it means to you?

960
01:01:46,787 --> 01:01:48,367
Oh,

961
01:01:48,622 --> 01:01:49,622
that.

962
01:01:50,874 --> 01:01:51,964
You do not like me?

963
01:01:52,835 --> 01:01:53,915
That's my trouble, Maria.

964
01:01:54,461 --> 01:01:55,461
I like you too much.

Hank, <i>cheri!</i>

966
01:01:59,174 --> 01:02:00,304
Now hold on... Hold on.

967
01:02:00,384 --> 01:02:02,144
I frighten you, yes?

968
01:02:02,219 --> 01:02:03,799
Yes, in a way you do.

969
01:02:03,971 --> 01:02:05,240
Now, wait. Maria, wait a minute.

970
01:02:05,264 --> 01:02:06,814
Now, wait, wait. Listen to me.

971
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:08,929
We can't go running into things,

972
01:02:08,976 --> 01:02:09,976
- you know?
- No!

973
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:12,810
(STAMMERING) No,
I mean this takes thought and plans.

974
01:02:13,063 --> 01:02:15,323
You are so thoughtful and so intelligent.

975
01:02:16,024 --> 01:02:17,034
Yeah.

976
01:02:19,069 --> 01:02:21,909
Maria, a couple like us
has got to be awful darn sure.

977
01:02:21,989 --> 01:02:24,029
You know,
I don't care what Father Sylvain says.

978
01:02:26,326 --> 01:02:27,536
Father Sylvain?

979
01:02:27,786 --> 01:02:29,222
Yeah, you know.
How he's always talking,

980
01:02:29,246 --> 01:02:31,166
not good for a man to be alone,
things like that.

981
01:02:31,665 --> 01:02:33,017
Well, it's just not for me right now.

982
01:02:33,041 --> 01:02:34,881
You understand, don't you, Maria?

983
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,210
I'm trying to, <i>monsieur.</i>

984
01:02:38,672 --> 01:02:40,552
Look, Maria, you're a beautiful girl.

985
01:02:41,341 --> 01:02:43,221
You're fun to be with...

986
01:02:46,764 --> 01:02:48,524
Marriage is just not for me. Not...

987
01:02:48,849 --> 01:02:49,849
Right now.

988
01:02:51,685 --> 01:02:54,555
That's very considerate of you
to be so honest with me, <i>monsieur.</i>

989
01:02:57,566 --> 01:03:00,186
Well, I think it's only fair, that, uh...

990
01:03:01,737 --> 01:03:04,697
A guy lets a know where she stands...
I mean where he stands.

991
01:03:05,908 --> 01:03:08,288
Forgive me if I've been
forcing myself upon you.

992
01:03:08,368 --> 01:03:10,158
- Maria!
<i>- Bonsoir, monsieur.</i>

993
01:03:10,204 --> 01:03:12,874
Look, wait a minute.
I didn't mean to say anything wrong.

994
01:03:12,956 --> 01:03:14,366
It's of no importance.

995
01:03:14,875 --> 01:03:17,665
Look, Maria, why is it that we end up
this way all of the time?

996
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:22,380
Why do you always have to talk
so much and be so... Honest?

997
01:03:23,675 --> 01:03:24,715
Maria!

998
01:04:05,801 --> 01:04:06,931
Hello.

01:04:08,595 --> 01:04:10,055
You are Henri Dussard?

01:04:10,097 --> 01:04:11,267
Yeah.

1001
01:04:11,515 --> 01:04:14,135
I am Yolande Angelli, your cousin.

01:04:25,571 --> 01:04:26,781
Would you mind if I join you?

1007
01:04:27,239 --> 01:04:28,239
Please.

1008
01:04:29,825 --> 01:04:30,825
You will need it.

1009
01:04:32,744 --> 01:04:34,874
- I will?
- I'm going to live here with you.

Your Uncle Antan
was also my Uncle Antan.

1012
01:04:43,338 --> 01:04:47,088
So, half of this property is mine.

1013
01:04:47,426 --> 01:04:48,796
What did you say your name was?

1014
01:04:49,094 --> 01:04:50,554
Yolande Angelli.

1015
01:04:50,804 --> 01:04:52,564
I don't remember
any Angelli's in the family.

1016
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:54,980
Nevertheless I am your cousin,

1017
01:04:55,058 --> 01:04:56,228
on your mother's side.

1018
01:04:56,602 --> 01:04:59,442
And the law of France says that, uh...

1019
01:04:59,563 --> 01:05:02,113
Read it for yourself, <i>monsieur.</i>

1020
01:05:06,653 --> 01:05:08,573
Oh, Emile Paraulis, huh?

1021
01:05:08,947 --> 01:05:10,817
- You know him?
- Yes, slightly.

1022
01:05:11,783 --> 01:05:12,783
This his doing?

1023
01:05:13,243 --> 01:05:14,243
You might say that.

1024
01:05:14,953 --> 01:05:17,003
As a friend,
he's looking out for my interests.

1025
01:05:18,498 --> 01:05:21,788
- Oh.
- (YAWNS) Where do I sleep?

1026
01:05:22,169 --> 01:05:23,299
Sleep?

1027
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:24,710
Yes, where is my room?

1028
01:05:27,341 --> 01:05:29,721
Uh, take my bedroom.

1029
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:31,430
Where will you sleep?

1030
01:05:31,553 --> 01:05:32,553
I'm not sleepy.

1031
01:05:33,263 --> 01:05:36,183
I mean I'm going to
stay out here and think.

1032
01:05:36,808 --> 01:05:38,808
I do not wish to put <i>monsieur</i> out.

1033
01:05:39,186 --> 01:05:41,266
Perhaps I could use that room
off the kitchen.

1034
01:05:41,355 --> 01:05:44,515
No! I mean, no, no, you can't use
that room, it's an old store room.

1035
01:05:44,608 --> 01:05:45,608
Wouldn't do at all.

1036
01:05:46,026 --> 01:05:47,856
You are lying, <i>monsieur.</i>

1037
01:05:48,862 --> 01:05:49,862
What?

1038
01:05:50,822 --> 01:05:52,872
Something is in there.

1039
01:05:52,950 --> 01:05:55,120
That's what I said. It's a store room.

1040
01:05:55,577 --> 01:05:56,747
A store room for what?

1041
01:05:56,828 --> 01:05:59,618
Well for... Things, what else?

1042
01:05:59,873 --> 01:06:00,923
I've heard noises.

1043
01:06:01,208 --> 01:06:03,628
- No.
- People moving around, whispering.

1044
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:05,000
- Go on.
- Are those your slaves?

1045
01:06:05,212 --> 01:06:06,212
My slaves?

1046
01:06:06,338 --> 01:06:08,838
<i>Monsieur</i> Paraulis said you were
keeping slaves like animals,

1047
01:06:08,882 --> 01:06:11,222
or animals like slaves, or something.

1048
01:06:11,301 --> 01:06:13,011
As your cousin,
I have a right to know.

1049
01:06:13,261 --> 01:06:15,641
Now look, you're all mixed up.
I do not keep slaves!

1050
01:06:15,847 --> 01:06:17,927
You are not living here alone, <i>monsieur.</i>

1051
01:06:18,016 --> 01:06:20,346
Be honest with me.
Who is locked up in there?

1052
01:06:20,727 --> 01:06:22,347
There is nobody locked up in there!

in the house, you and me.

1054
01:06:24,272 --> 01:06:25,982
Don't talk to me about honesty.

1055
01:06:26,233 --> 01:06:27,733
I'm honest to a fault.

1056
01:06:27,776 --> 01:06:29,003
I lose all my friends that way.

1057
01:06:29,027 --> 01:06:30,067
Now shut up and go to bed.

1058
01:06:37,995 --> 01:06:39,865
<i>Bonsoir, monsieur.</i>

1059
01:06:47,921 --> 01:06:48,921
Oh, boy.

1060
01:07:10,110 --> 01:07:11,110
(DOOR OPENS)

1061
01:07:13,613 --> 01:07:14,663
Hank...

1062
01:07:16,074 --> 01:07:18,374
I'm sorry.
I had no right to lose my temper.

1063
01:07:19,244 --> 01:07:22,584
Father Sylvain says it's not good
to let the sun go down upon your...

1064
01:07:22,873 --> 01:07:23,873
(DOOR OPENS)

1065
01:07:27,544 --> 01:07:28,884
Your anger.

1066
01:07:29,337 --> 01:07:30,337
Who is this?

1067
01:07:31,131 --> 01:07:33,761
Um... This is my neighbor.

1068
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:37,550
Neighbor, Maria, meet, uh... My cousin.

1069
01:07:41,475 --> 01:07:43,805
Look, I know what you're thinking
and you're wrong!

1070
01:07:43,977 --> 01:07:47,187
You don't have to explain it to me,
<i>monsieur</i>. I do not care.

1071
01:07:47,397 --> 01:07:48,624
- Tell her.
- YOLANDE: Tell her what?

1072
01:07:48,648 --> 01:07:50,460
Tell her who you are
and what you're doing here.

1073
01:07:50,484 --> 01:07:51,904
Oh, that!

1074
01:07:52,277 --> 01:07:54,317
Dry your tears, <i>cherie.</i>

1075
01:07:54,571 --> 01:07:57,411
As cousin, half of this property is mine!

1076
01:07:57,657 --> 01:07:58,987
So, here I am!

1077
01:08:00,035 --> 01:08:01,035
Is it true?

1078
01:08:01,787 --> 01:08:03,867
Well, you heard her,
it's all spelled out right here.

1079
01:08:04,164 --> 01:08:06,464
I am sorry about this, <i>cherie,</i>
but of course

1080
01:08:06,583 --> 01:08:09,753
it is always better
to know the truth before marriage.

1081
01:08:10,170 --> 01:08:11,510
Is it not so?

1082
01:08:12,422 --> 01:08:14,262
- I'll walk you home.
- You needn't bother.

1083
01:08:14,341 --> 01:08:16,801
Now let's not start that again,
I'm walking you home.

1084
01:08:17,177 --> 01:08:18,177
Here, hold this.

1085
01:08:18,762 --> 01:08:19,812
Maria...

1086
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:21,180
Maria!

1087
01:08:21,431 --> 01:08:23,231
Wait a minute. I need your help.

1088
01:08:23,308 --> 01:08:24,660
Why don't you ask
your cousin to help you?

1089
01:08:24,684 --> 01:08:25,984
Now, you listen to me.

1090
01:08:26,353 --> 01:08:27,853
I didn't invite her here.

1091
01:08:28,313 --> 01:08:29,733
She was sent by Paraulis.

1092
01:08:30,482 --> 01:08:32,862
Don't you see it's another scheme
to stop my monkeys?

1093
01:08:32,901 --> 01:08:36,201
- But then she's not your cousin.
- I don't know who she is.

1094
01:08:37,906 --> 01:08:38,906
Believe me.

1095
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:42,235
I believe you, Hank.

1096
01:08:43,411 --> 01:08:44,411
Good.

1097
01:08:49,292 --> 01:08:51,382
Right now I'm worried
about the monkeys.

1098
01:08:51,711 --> 01:08:53,801
The olives are ripe,
the big wind's due any day...

1099
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:56,050
If Paraulis can legally tie up my estate,

1100
01:08:56,133 --> 01:08:58,643
I may never get anybody's olives
picked, including my own.

1101
01:08:59,636 --> 01:09:00,636
It could wipe me out.

1102
01:09:00,762 --> 01:09:02,222
Does she know about the monkeys?

1103
01:09:02,597 --> 01:09:03,927
No, I don't think so.

1104
01:09:04,432 --> 01:09:07,062
Then we better get them out of
the house before she does see them!

1105
01:09:07,227 --> 01:09:09,147
Yeah, I know.
The problem is where to keep them.

1106
01:09:09,396 --> 01:09:11,016
We have a big, empty barn.

1107
01:09:11,231 --> 01:09:12,231
That's good.

1108
01:09:12,732 --> 01:09:14,072
No, wait a minute!

1109
01:09:15,068 --> 01:09:17,568
(WHISPERING) Let's wait
til she's asleep, come here.

1110
01:09:27,747 --> 01:09:28,747
(SHUSHING)

1111
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:39,175
Hank...

1112
01:09:45,432 --> 01:09:46,932
(CHITTERING)

1113
01:09:47,893 --> 01:09:48,893
Come on.

1114
01:10:29,809 --> 01:10:31,139
(GASPS)

1115
01:10:49,955 --> 01:10:51,675
Oh, wait a moment,
I will light the lantern.

1116
01:10:52,666 --> 01:10:53,666
At ease.

1117
01:10:58,755 --> 01:10:59,755
Come on.

1118
01:11:04,344 --> 01:11:05,724
Hey, come back here!

1119
01:11:06,012 --> 01:11:07,012
Oh, let them play.

1120
01:11:07,514 --> 01:11:08,814
Enjoy their new home.

1121
01:11:09,307 --> 01:11:10,887

chickens... Madeline!

- (GROANING)

1125
01:11:28,618 --> 01:11:30,448
Are you sure...

1126
01:11:31,329 --> 01:11:33,569
Are you sure your mother won't
mind us keeping them here?

1127
01:11:33,748 --> 01:11:35,828
Oh, but of course not.
Mama loves animals.

1128
01:11:35,875 --> 01:11:38,375
Yeah, uh-huh. I'm glad to hear that.

1129
01:11:40,171 --> 01:11:42,171
(CHITTERING)

1130
01:11:42,716 --> 01:11:44,336
Oh, God!

1131
01:11:44,843 --> 01:11:48,313
Okay. That does it! Everybody up
in the hay loft and stay put!

1132
01:11:49,431 --> 01:11:50,431
Come on!

1133
01:11:51,433 --> 01:11:53,023
Come on. Come on.

1134
01:11:54,394 --> 01:11:56,404
All right. You too, Celeste. Go on.

1135
01:11:58,189 --> 01:12:00,069
All right, settle down up
there and go to sleep!

1136
01:12:03,111 --> 01:12:04,111
You see they like it.

1137
01:12:04,446 --> 01:12:06,026
They will be happy here.

1138
01:12:06,072 --> 01:12:08,532
Yeah, but first we've got to get rid
of these lethal weapons.

1139
01:12:09,534 --> 01:12:10,544
Oh, Maria...

1140
01:12:11,411 --> 01:12:12,751
I appreciate you doing this.

1141
01:12:13,288 --> 01:12:15,458
Anything to save
the monkeys, <i>monsieur.</i>

1142
01:12:16,750 --> 01:12:17,880
Hank.

1143
01:12:18,918 --> 01:12:19,918
Hank.

(LAUGHING)

1146
01:12:34,017 --> 01:12:35,017
What in...

1147
01:13:01,169 --> 01:13:02,169
<i>Bonjour, mademoiselle.</i>

1148
01:13:02,462 --> 01:13:04,342
<i>Bonjour,</i> looking for Dussard?

1149
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:07,470
<i>- Oui.</i>
- He left before I got up.

1150
01:13:07,842 --> 01:13:09,142
Shall I tell him you called?

1151
01:13:09,469 --> 01:13:11,639
No, <i>merci</i>. It's of no importance.

1152
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:13,809
<i>Cherie,</i> come in.

1153
01:13:14,307 --> 01:13:16,427
Please, I would like to talk to you.

1154
01:13:16,810 --> 01:13:18,940
All right, but I cannot stay long.

1155
01:13:24,609 --> 01:13:26,689
Please. Would you like some coffee?

1156
01:13:26,778 --> 01:13:27,778
No, <i>merci.</i>

1157
01:13:31,116 --> 01:13:33,786
You are the fiance of
<i>Monsieur</i> Dussard, yes?

1158
01:13:34,077 --> 01:13:35,537
I am his fiance, no.

1159
01:13:35,620 --> 01:13:38,830
Oh. Then you can speak frankly.

1160
01:13:39,833 --> 01:13:42,673
What kind of man is this Dussard?

1161
01:13:42,836 --> 01:13:44,046
What kind of man?

1162
01:13:44,337 --> 01:13:46,417
Is there not something
strange about him?

1163
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:49,680
He is a bachelor and he lives by himself.

1164
01:13:49,843 --> 01:13:50,893
That is strange?

1165
01:13:51,136 --> 01:13:54,506
He may be a bachelor, <i>cherie,</i>
but he does not live by himself.

1166
01:13:54,806 --> 01:13:55,806
No?

1167
01:13:56,266 --> 01:13:58,556
What of the room with
the bars in the window?

1168
01:14:00,019 --> 01:14:01,019
Oh, that...

1169
01:14:02,313 --> 01:14:03,693
That is not for me to say.

1170
01:14:04,023 --> 01:14:05,023
It is bad?

1171
01:14:05,358 --> 01:14:06,358
Bad, <i>mademoiselle?</i>

1172
01:14:06,609 --> 01:14:07,899
I heard sounds last night.

1173
01:14:07,986 --> 01:14:12,156
Like whispering and thumping
and the patter of feet...

1174
01:14:12,615 --> 01:14:15,025
I got up to look... Poof! Nothing!

1175
01:14:15,535 --> 01:14:16,655
So?

1176
01:14:17,203 --> 01:14:18,543
Is this place haunted?

1177
01:14:20,498 --> 01:14:21,708
Do you believe in ghosts?

1178
01:14:22,208 --> 01:14:23,628
Certainly not.

1179
01:14:24,043 --> 01:14:26,463
But... Why do you ask?

1180
01:14:27,130 --> 01:14:28,130
Mmm-hmm...

1181
01:14:28,256 --> 01:14:29,916
What's this "Mmm-hmm?"

1182
01:14:30,550 --> 01:14:32,890
You do not know
about your uncle Antan?

1183
01:14:34,262 --> 01:14:35,562
What about him?

1184
01:14:35,638 --> 01:14:37,518
But you are family,
you must have heard!

1185
01:14:38,475 --> 01:14:41,185
We were never a very close family.

1186
01:14:41,603 --> 01:14:42,853
What is it I should know?

1187
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:46,110
Well... You will promise
not to tell who told you?

1188
01:14:46,191 --> 01:14:47,611
I will swear to it.

1189
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:51,700
(WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY)

1190
01:14:53,448 --> 01:14:57,698
<i>Monsieur</i> Paraulis
has secured very clever legal advice.

1191
01:14:58,077 --> 01:14:59,763
All I know is that
if she gets half of my property,

1192
01:14:59,787 --> 01:15:01,207
I might as well quit right now.

1193
01:15:01,331 --> 01:15:04,211
No, no, no, Henri.
Let us not be hasty.

1194
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:05,880
After all, you still have your monkeys.

1195
01:15:05,919 --> 01:15:08,669
Well, not according to this... I don't.

1196
01:15:08,755 --> 01:15:09,915
She gets half of everything!

1197
01:15:10,215 --> 01:15:11,715
- Is it true?
<i>- Oui, mon pere.</i>

1198
01:15:11,966 --> 01:15:15,176
Unless the <i>monsieur</i> can prove
he did not use inherited property

1199
01:15:15,261 --> 01:15:17,761
with which to buy his monkeys.
Can you, <i>monsieur?</i>

1200
01:15:18,181 --> 01:15:21,601
No, of course I can't.
That's exactly how I bought 'em.

1201
01:15:22,018 --> 01:15:23,728
I mortgaged the property.

1202
01:15:24,354 --> 01:15:26,444
This is possibly a complete fraud.

1203
01:15:26,523 --> 01:15:29,573
I suggest you retain a lawyer and fight it.

1204
01:15:30,109 --> 01:15:33,199
And pay him with what?
Half a failing farm?

1205
01:15:33,905 --> 01:15:36,445
Mr. Mayor, it's been nice knowing you.

1206
01:15:37,158 --> 01:15:38,158
Father...

1207
01:15:38,284 --> 01:15:39,834
No, you're not leaving.

1208
01:15:39,953 --> 01:15:41,663
Yup. I don't belong here.

01:15:43,498 --> 01:15:44,998
You cannot leave us now.

1211
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:46,708
Sorry, Father.

1212
01:15:47,919 --> 01:15:49,669
Henri, wait. Henri. Henri!

1213
01:15:55,468 --> 01:15:56,588
Henri, you...

1214
01:15:57,053 --> 01:15:58,303
You should reconsider.

1215
01:15:59,097 --> 01:16:00,517
Father, I know when I'm beat.

1216
01:16:01,182 --> 01:16:03,352
Oh, Maria. I'm glad you've come.

1217
01:16:03,851 --> 01:16:06,351

We're going to join the circus
and see the world.

1222
01:16:18,575 --> 01:16:20,865
I tried to reason with him,
but it's of no use.

1223
01:16:20,952 --> 01:16:22,202
You can't leave us now!

1224
01:16:23,413 --> 01:16:24,663

1225
01:16:26,082 --> 01:16:27,082
I...

1226
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:30,420
