1
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:06,687
Come on, Tasha.

2
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,287
Come on! That's the idea.
Come on! Come on! Come on, Tasha.

3
00:02:10,364 --> 00:02:14,232
Come on back. Come get the apple.
Come on, boy. Come on.

4
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:18,033
Come on. Keep on comin'.
Come on. That's a good boy.

5
00:02:18,105 --> 00:02:22,099
Come on. Come on. Keep on comin'.
That's the idea.

6
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:27,011
Come on. Come and get it.
That's a good boy...

7
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:30,674
Stay. That's a'way, Tasha.

8
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:36,014
That's a good boy, Tasha.
That's a'way.

9
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,971
Smith!

10
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:13,791
Smith! Smith!

11
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:18,624
Where ya been for three days, Smith?
Ma's fit to be tied.

12
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:22,158
I've been up in the higher range
tracking down this scrawny beef.

13
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:24,932
- Ma been inquirin' about me?
- Inquiring?

14
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:27,099
She says when she
gets her hands on you...

15
00:03:27,174 --> 00:03:29,336
She's been inquirin'...

16
00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:33,875
"Three days he's gone," she says.
And the two of us here all alone.

17
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:34,971
What's for supper?

18
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:38,507
"We could be murdered in our beds
for all your father cares,” she said.

19
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:40,053
Chicken stew for supper.

20
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,112
What's this about who
being murdered in who's bed?

21
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:46,626
I dunno. But she's been walking
around the house with your shotgun

22
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:48,855
like there's gonna be a massacre.

23
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:52,627
Well, sometimes your ma gets
carried away by the pioneer spirit.

24
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:54,189
Huh.

25
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:10,077
Smith, remember
what we were talkin' about?

26
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,175
Three days ago before you took off?

27
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:16,189
Hope it isn't rooster stew for supper
considering the caliber of our chickens.

28
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:20,022
We were talking about Tashie.
And you said the day after Christmas

29
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,562
that you'd break 'em for me
so I could ride him.

30
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:24,791
Well, you got my solemn word, son.

31
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:29,393
- You didn't in January and February...
- And March and April and May...

32
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:33,235
Lemme tell you somethin', there's
only one way to break an Appaloosa.

33
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:36,833
That's the good old-fashioned
Indian talk way.

34
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:41,347
Eh, now I made a deal with OI' Antoine,
in fact it was the day after Christmas.

35
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:43,815
I'm sure he'll get
around to it sometime.

36
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:46,046
- Pretty soon now, huh?
- OK, Smith.

37
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:49,521
- Just thought I'd mention it.
- Well, I'm glad you did, son.

38
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:52,487
- I'll speak to Antoine. All right?
- All right. OK.

39
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:57,558
All right, Charlie.
Get 'em in the pen there, boy.

40
00:04:58,064 --> 00:04:59,498
Come on, boy. Let's go.

41
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:28,621
"All right. Where you been and how come
you run off without telling me?"

42
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:32,464
Miss me? Hmm?

43
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:37,994
Oh, cut it out, will ya, Smith?

44
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:46,805
There's something going on in that old
shack on the other side of the meadow.

45
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,544
- Oh, really?
- Antoine's over there.

46
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:55,012
Oh, that's good. He's finally come
to break the Appaloosa for Albie.

47
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:57,284
There's someone in there with him!

48
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:02,527
Oh, now, Norah...

49
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:06,593
OI' Antoine must be
at least 97 years old.

50
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,327
- Smith, stop it!
- Wait a minute!

51
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:12,201
- That's the end of romance...
- Oh, stop it!

52
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:23,116
- All right, so who's with OI' Antoine?
- I think it's Gabriel Jimmyboy.

53
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:26,643
Smith, you've gotta
get him out of there.

54
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:30,115
- Norah...
- He's wanted for murder.

55
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:34,855
Please get him off our land.
I've been scared witless every night.

56
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:38,457
I don't know this Jimmyboy very well,

57
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:42,991
- but if he's a friend of Antoine...
- The police are after him!

58
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,503
Smith, he's got a gun!

59
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:48,839
How do you know he's got a gun?

60
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:52,209
I saw him. He and Antoine
went through the meadow

61
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:54,646
- heading for our old shack.
- Smith!

62
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:00,611
OI' Antoine's here! He wants
some kerosene for his lamp.

63
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:04,181
Can we make him stay for dinner, Ma?
Chicken stew's his favorite.

64
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,419
Can he, Ma? Make him stay.

65
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,832
Hello, this place!

66
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:21,535
Hello, Antoine.

67
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:24,443
- Conesta.
- Conesta.

68
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,714
Well, look who dropped by
to borrow a little kerosene.

69
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:33,117
Uh, Norah, maybe we could
talk him into staying for supper?

70
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:36,587
- Hello. Good evening.
- Hello. Good evening, OI' Antoine.

71
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:41,756
- Smith...
- Shh... Now listen.

72
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:44,058
He's only gonna
stay a little while.

73
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,472
Eat, OI' Antoine.

74
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,247
Here. Hmm?

75
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:04,847
- Oh, yeah. Go ahead.
- Antoine?

76
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:07,148
Smith says you're gonna
break my Appaloosa.

77
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,188
Could you do it
pretty soon, Antoine?

78
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:14,758
Will he do it, Smith?

79
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:18,488
I don't think he's talkin'
about your Appaloosa, Albie. He's...

80
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:23,502
He's comparing this stew
to the great famine of '78.

81
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,531
Yeah.

82
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,473
Antoine...

83
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:34,809
Who is in that old shack with you
on the other side of the hay meadow?

84
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:38,383
- Cut it out, will ya, Norah?
- We have a right to know.

85
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:40,818
How can we sleep
with a murderer on the loose?

86
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:42,150
Norah!

87
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,415
Antoine, listen to me.

88
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:47,783
Who...

89
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:54,464
- Hello, this place!
- It's Peterpaul!

90
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:58,095
Can I go out and play till it gets dark?
I'll stay close to the house.

91
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:04,104
- Norah...
- Antoine...

92
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:07,112
I'm gonna ask you once more.

93
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:17,655
Now see what you've done?

94
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:20,759
Antoine, I tell you what.

95
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:24,525
Come by for breakfast and then you and
I'll go hunting in the hills, all right?

96
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:29,091
Might be that chicken.
No she chicken.

97
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:33,138
Might be he chicken, I think.

98
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:42,838
Indian very funny.

99
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:48,977
Oh, he didn't mean anything
disrespectful, Norah. He...

100
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:52,890
- You know OI' Antoine...
- Sure I know.

101
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,485
Blood brother.
Taught you everything you know...

102
00:09:55,562 --> 00:09:57,496
As a matter of fact, he did.

103
00:09:57,564 --> 00:10:00,090
Ever since I could climb on
a horse and throw a rope.

104
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,965
All right, all right.
We buy OI' Antoine,

105
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:07,530
but what about the rest of them? They
sleep on our land. They eat our food.

106
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,338
They get into trouble
and you bail them out of jail.

107
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:14,313
And you give them our hay when we don't
even have enough for our own stock.

108
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:15,739
And...

109
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:20,417
I'm so fed up with Indians.

110
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:32,965
Norah, now you listen to me.

111
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:37,136
Somebody has to take care of them
or else they get pushed around.

112
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:41,867
But why does it
always have to be you?

113
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:45,872
Why do they always come here
when their sky falls down?

114
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,214
Where else would they go?

115
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:59,256
All right, I'll go up to the cabin
and I'll get rid of Gabriel Jimmyboy.

116
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,420
You just keep my coffee hot.

117
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,690
All right?

118
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:15,274
- Oh, Smith?
- Yeah?

119
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:19,371
- Here.
- What's that for?

120
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:23,006
- But he's a murderer.
- Well, I'm not.

121
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:28,681
- Tots alla.
- Tots alla, yourself.

122
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,749
- Oh, hi, Smith.
- Hi, Vince.

123
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:03,652
Smith, have you seen an Indian named,
uh, Gabriel Jimmyboy on your place?

124
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:08,455
- Jimmy who?
- Boy. Jimmyboy.

125
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:10,724
No. What's he look like?

126
00:12:10,797 --> 00:12:13,095
Looks like a blasted Indian. What else?

127
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,897
What's the matter with those dogs?
Can't they track Indians?

128
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:19,064
Eh... they've been trackin' all day.

129
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:22,371
They went and lost the trail
down there by Bear Creek.

130
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:27,243
Well, why don't you all go one back
to jail and kinda sleep it off, huh?

131
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:34,586
Look, Smith, somebody told the sheriff
they seen an Indian on your place.

132
00:12:34,654 --> 00:12:40,491
Have you
seen an Indian named Gabriel Jimmyboy?

133
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,688
No... No.

134
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:49,935
Well, I think I'll just get down to
the old shack of yours and look myself.

135
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:53,897
Hey, Vince. You got a warrant?

136
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:58,309
- This Indian murdered a man.
- Are you sure?

137
00:12:58,411 --> 00:13:01,005
Well, now what do you want,
a personal affidavit?

138
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:03,675
He's an Indian, ain't he?
And he was drunk, wasn't he?

139
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,481
Money's gone and Sam Hardy's dead.
What else do you need?

140
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:10,283
I don't think the sheriff would
want you poking around that shack

141
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:11,824
without a search warrant.

142
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:15,350
- I don't need no warrant for no Indian!
- But you need your job.

143
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:18,557
Now don't do anything bull-headed.
You might lose it.

144
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,657
Hello, this place. It's me, Smith.

145
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:11,443
What's your friend holdin' a gun for?

146
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,349
I mean, it's only Smith.

147
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:16,514
He's scared, this place only one door.

148
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:23,360
Well, uh... yeah.

149
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:28,128
Uh... suppose we sit down here
and have a smoke, huh?

150
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:32,468
Never mind smoke. Tell him.

151
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,837
- Smith...
- What?

152
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:38,343
Me and Gabriel, we talk.

153
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:45,183
I tell him maybe you help,
so they don't kill him on that rope.

154
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:47,379
What kind of help, Antoine?

155
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:52,487
The sheriff, they look for Gabriel.
With them dogs.

156
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:56,290
They better not come this place.
I shoot.

157
00:14:56,362 --> 00:15:01,596
Gabriel, he wants to go away.
He go with you, Smith.

158
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:05,069
Hide him in that truck.
You take him to Canada.

159
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:09,808
- What?
- It's the best way, Smith.

160
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:14,773
Oh, now wait a minute.
No, that isn't the best way.

161
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:19,614
You gotta have him turn himself in
and stand trial. That's the best way.

162
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:30,730
T hd hide, bocause they ! find va.

163
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:34,825
And they'll bring ya back to trial.

164
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,600
- Why do you say that?
- They kill me in that rope.

165
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:48,571
Maybe Smith right.
You go to court, Gabriel.

166
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:53,551
- No.
- You go, Gabriel. I speak for you.

167
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,850
OI' Antoine speak for Gabriel Jimmyboy.

168
00:15:56,923 --> 00:15:59,017
Wait, you'll speak for him?

169
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,924
Is there something you know?
I mean, about what happened?

170
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:06,058
I know that day very well.

171
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:22,973
Antoine, why do you talk of the past?

172
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:25,416
That has nothing to do with Gabriel.

173
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:30,685
Oh, he know it's old man's talk.

174
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:35,853
...the General Howard.

175
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:39,990
What are you talking about General
Howard for? That was 90 years ago.

176
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:43,696
Now, Antoine...

177
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:45,533
We wait now.

178
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:58,711
Well, I guess the best thing we can do
is smoke a peace pipe. Here.

179
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:30,410
Smith isn't gonna like this, Ma.

180
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:34,420
It's been more than three hours. He
may be lying in a pool of blood by now.

181
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:37,354
You lock that door and don't
let anybody in. Do you hear me?

182
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:40,051
- OK, Ma.
- OK.

183
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:54,535
The policemen,
they pay $500 anybody find Gabriel.

184
00:17:56,042 --> 00:18:01,879
I bring Gabriel to this court,
take $500 and get good lawyer.

185
00:18:01,948 --> 00:18:06,181
No.

186
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:12,783
Hey, hold it! Just wait a minute.
We don't need money for a lawyer.

187
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:16,294
The Indian Bureau will get
a lawyer for Gabriel Jimmyboy.

188
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:20,431
- You trust Indian Bureau?
- Well, sure.

189
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:24,163
Sure. You not Indian.

190
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:55,329
That's just Norah, my wife.
She's come to tell me how late it is.

191
00:18:56,869 --> 00:19:01,773
Gabriel, she's not mad at you.
She's just gettin' set to bawl me out.

192
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:15,815
So long, Antoine. Bye, Gabriel.

193
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:21,552
You think over what I said. Hmm?

194
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:38,633
Are you all right?

195
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,708
Norah, it isn't often that I get mad.

196
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:46,150
Please don't get mad now, Smith.

197
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:49,552
- Well, you oughta know better.
- I couldn't help it.

198
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:53,923
I got to thinking of you up there
all alone with that crazy murderer.

199
00:19:53,993 --> 00:19:57,361
- He could've killed you.
- You could've got us both killed.

200
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,455
Aw, Smith.

201
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:03,126
- Smith, Smith.
- All right.

202
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:08,470
I'm sorry. It's just that
I've been so churned up lately.

203
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:12,307
- Smith?
- What?

204
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:15,245
What about Gabriel Jimmyboy?

205
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:21,186
I told him to give himself up, but the
guy's scared they're gonna hang him.

206
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:24,549
Rightfully he should give himself up,
shouldn't he?

207
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:27,356
I don't know about "rightfully."

208
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:31,886
There's only one thing worse than being
a cow rancher: That's being an Indian.

209
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:47,470
- Did you ever see him?
- Sure. Lotsa times.

210
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:52,677
Does he look like...
he killed somebody?

211
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,846
Look like Indian.

212
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:57,981
You're a great help.

213
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:45,763
- Hold still.
- I'm trying to.

214
00:21:45,838 --> 00:21:48,307
Shh...

215
00:21:48,374 --> 00:21:51,105
- Charlie, cut it out.
- Shh...

216
00:21:51,177 --> 00:21:53,305
Charlie, go away.

217
00:21:53,379 --> 00:21:57,247
Run! He's got a gun!

218
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:09,893
- I see him. He have gun.
- You didn't see anything.

219
00:22:09,962 --> 00:22:13,421
- There wasn't anybody in there.
- You sure?

220
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:17,561
Sure, I'm sure.
You got too much imagination.

221
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:22,096
- Sound like somebody with gun.
- Go back and look for yourself.

222
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,006
I take your word.

223
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,473
Maybe we oughta get out of here anyway.

224
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:30,015
Yeah.

225
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:33,818
Let's go to the Topin Ridge and play.

226
00:22:53,606 --> 00:22:57,133
Charlie, stay!

227
00:23:02,982 --> 00:23:07,920
Come on, Charlie. There's probably
rattlers in there. Come on.

228
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:14,988
It's him. It's Jimmyboy.
He kill Sam Hardy.

229
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,553
I no kill him. Somehow they cheat me.

230
00:23:18,631 --> 00:23:23,068
I tell him he cheat. We fight. No kill.

231
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:30,571
- You a Smith boy?
- Yes, sir.

232
00:23:30,643 --> 00:23:34,341
Smith good man.
You see OI' Antoine?

233
00:23:35,848 --> 00:23:38,909
No.

234
00:23:39,952 --> 00:23:45,288
He say he come here. Plenty to eat.

235
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:49,260
He too old man.
He forget, I think.

236
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:57,702
- You hungry, Mr. Jimmyboy?
- No eat long time.

237
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:01,335
Listen, Mr. Jimmyboy,
we'll bring you food every day.

238
00:24:01,407 --> 00:24:04,934
- And we'll have a signal.
- Eh? You tell.

239
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:07,445
No, no. I swear.

240
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:14,545
You go. If you tell...

241
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:17,582
Don't worry.

242
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:24,252
Hey! Listen, when we
come back, we'll whistle.

243
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:28,096
Come on, Peterpaul.
Come on, Charlie.

244
00:24:43,015 --> 00:24:46,110
- Hello, Smith!
- Hello, Walter Charlie.

245
00:24:50,923 --> 00:24:53,790
You get the barn
ready to bring hay crop, I see.

246
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:57,386
Yeah, I'm getting' the barn ready.
What's on your mind?

247
00:24:57,463 --> 00:24:59,864
I've come to talk to OI' Antoine.

248
00:24:59,932 --> 00:25:02,560
OI' Antoine break your
Appaloosa someday, huh?

249
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:04,796
Well, I haven't seen OI' Antoine.

250
00:25:05,471 --> 00:25:07,405
I know.

251
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:11,533
Ol' Antoine,
he's someplace with Gabriel Jimmyboy.

252
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:16,479
- By and by, he come to this place.
- Well, so?

253
00:25:17,783 --> 00:25:20,878
I know a policeman give $500
for Gabriel Jimmyboy.

254
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:26,058
Well, suppose you find Gabriel.
You'll be a rich man.

255
00:25:26,792 --> 00:25:30,854
I can't do. Too official.

256
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:36,131
Are you gonna be the
court interpreter again this year?

257
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,363
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, boy.

258
00:25:39,238 --> 00:25:42,833
It's no good for official
to collect reward money.

259
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:45,511
You get $500.

260
00:25:47,446 --> 00:25:50,143
We split. You keep $100.

261
00:25:50,349 --> 00:25:52,841
I'm taking up a lot
of your valuable time, Walter.

262
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:56,354
- Hop on that bike and pedal off.
- OK, Smith.

263
00:25:56,422 --> 00:25:58,356
I make good bargain.

264
00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:02,525
1 give you $150. No more.

265
00:26:05,264 --> 00:26:06,925
Doggone it.
Look what you did!

266
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:10,458
That's all right, Smith.
I give you plenty time to think it over.

267
00:26:10,536 --> 00:26:15,201
- Yeah, sure I know.
- What did Walter Charlie want?

268
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:19,608
Ah, he wanted to give me $150
if I turn in Gabriel Jimmyboy.

269
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:25,047
- Cash?
- Oh, now white lady very funny.

270
00:26:27,553 --> 00:26:30,818
Come on. Quit worrying, Norah.
We're gonna make it this year.

271
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:32,914
No, we're not, Smith.

272
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:36,427
Look at that hay crop. It's full
of weeds and we're down to 78 head

273
00:26:36,495 --> 00:26:39,760
on the breeding stock. The bank
said even a hundred cow ranch

274
00:26:39,832 --> 00:26:43,166
- can't make the grade anymore.
- You're absolutely right.

275
00:26:43,235 --> 00:26:45,829
- It's all your fault.
- Oh, Smith!

276
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:49,932
Come on, it isn't that bad. We get that
hay cut, everything's gonna be fine.

277
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:54,275
If it gets cut. If McDonald Lasheway
comes with his mowers,

278
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:58,874
and if McDonald's Indians
feel like mowing and...!

279
00:27:00,486 --> 00:27:02,853
Oh, Smith!

280
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:37,850
- That sounds like the sheriff's dogs.
- Yeah. It does.

281
00:27:37,923 --> 00:27:41,120
Well, I guess Gabriel Jimmyboy
decided not to give himself up.

282
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:05,408
Well, that's another
dead-end for those old hound dogs.

283
00:28:07,653 --> 00:28:08,950
Smith?

284
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,659
- Smith?
- Yeah?

285
00:28:13,926 --> 00:28:16,486
If you made a promise to someone...

286
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:21,292
I mean, if you know the
whereabouts of a certain person...

287
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,960
Come on, Rufus, you find him now.
You find him.

288
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:27,097
Come on, Rufus. You find him. Yeah.

289
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:29,197
Hello, Vince. Any luck?

290
00:28:30,409 --> 00:28:32,935
I wasted two whole days
gettin' a search warrant.

291
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:35,776
I oughta run you in for harboring
a fugitive from justice.

292
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:40,318
- Oh, I wouldn't try that.
- You see this rag?

293
00:28:40,686 --> 00:28:43,712
Well, it's got Gabriel Jimmyboy's
scent all over it.

294
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:46,555
All right, now where you hiding him?

295
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:53,623
Well, I'll tell ya, I'm hiding him...

296
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:57,936
...in an old copper mine.

297
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:02,634
All right, get those stupid dogs goin'.

298
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:13,378
I'll even odds Gabriel's
a hundred miles away from here by now.

299
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:17,154
No, he isn't, Smith.

300
00:29:17,456 --> 00:29:20,482
You were right.
He is in the old copper mine.

301
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,857
Ah, doesn't matter. Those dogs...

302
00:29:29,668 --> 00:29:30,726
He's where?

303
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:33,635
In the old copper mine
at the Tokin Ridge.

304
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:35,605
Me and Peterpaul brought him food.

305
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:40,802
Albie, in ten years I haven't
laid one single hand on you.

306
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:43,246
He's awful nice, Smith.

307
00:29:43,315 --> 00:29:44,840
He couldn't"a done it.

308
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:50,353
If Vince gets there first,
there's gonna be shootin'.

309
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:07,856
Yeah, we got 'em now, eh?

310
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:16,802
Gabriel Jimmyboy?

311
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:21,369
This is a police officer.
Come out with your hands up.

312
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:25,912
I'll give you just five seconds.

313
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:28,885
And if you don't come out,
we'll come in and get ya.

314
00:31:29,521 --> 00:31:33,788
One...! Two...!

315
00:31:33,859 --> 00:31:37,989
Three...! Four...!

316
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:40,364
Five!

317
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:45,092
All right, let 'em go.

318
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:55,142
We got 'em now.

319
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,642
Well, get those dogs!

320
00:32:10,562 --> 00:32:13,657
I guess Mr. Jimmyboy wasn't in there.

321
00:32:13,732 --> 00:32:16,997
Yeah, it's lucky for Vince he wasn't.

322
00:32:19,838 --> 00:32:23,468
Smith, what will they do with
Gabriel Jimmyboy when they catch him?

323
00:32:27,813 --> 00:32:31,215
Well, I wouldn't worry about that.
They haven't caught him yet.

324
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:54,003
- Hey, did you find that Indian?
- What does it look like?

325
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:58,675
Let those idiots go!

326
00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:03,779
Would you do what I tell ya?

327
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:43,744
Vince, put that gun away.

328
00:33:43,822 --> 00:33:46,621
Sheriff, I've been
trailing him ever since Bear Creek.

329
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:51,128
You never trail nothing. OI' Antoine
brought him in here a half hour ago.

330
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:54,359
Get them fool dogs outta here.

331
00:34:00,939 --> 00:34:04,933
- Make your mark, Antoine.
- Wait a minute, Chief. What is this?

332
00:34:06,745 --> 00:34:12,047
Antoine bring in Gabriel Jimmyboy.
Get $500.

333
00:34:12,117 --> 00:34:14,552
You're not gonna let him
get away with that, are ya?

334
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:17,247
Antoine, you go sit at my desk.

335
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:20,284
- Lock up the prisoner, Vince.
- Just a minute, chief.

336
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:22,452
I've been working on this case
night and day.

337
00:34:22,928 --> 00:34:24,919
Will you do like I tell ya?

338
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:33,963
Now just put your mark on there,
Antoine. We'll see you get your money.

339
00:34:57,495 --> 00:35:00,157
Soda pop.

340
00:35:09,341 --> 00:35:10,900
Smith...?

341
00:35:11,977 --> 00:35:13,945
Vince is just pulling up.

342
00:35:14,813 --> 00:35:18,943
Look, Gabriel, you just gotta
sorta take things easy 'cause...

343
00:35:19,017 --> 00:35:21,611
...everything's gonna
turn out all right.

344
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:23,347
I don't know, Smith.

345
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:28,883
Maybe was better to go to Canada.

346
00:35:30,095 --> 00:35:33,429
- Maybe now they kill me in that rope.
- Nobody's gonna kill ya.

347
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:35,933
You're gonna get a fair trial.

348
00:35:36,201 --> 00:35:38,761
Now you just... you must...

349
00:35:38,837 --> 00:35:41,306
You just must believe that.

350
00:35:43,575 --> 00:35:45,634
Not easy to believe, Smith.

351
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:48,304
Now you listen with your head.

352
00:35:49,681 --> 00:35:52,582
You stop thinkin' about that rope.

353
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:56,747
You just... just stop.

354
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:02,452
- OK, Smith.
- Smith!

355
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:03,719
OK.

356
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,589
Smith...

357
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,296
You believe I don't do this thing?

358
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:17,273
Well, why do you think I came here?

359
00:36:19,144 --> 00:36:21,044
All right, Smith. Look out.

360
00:36:24,616 --> 00:36:28,075
Smith, you don't have to come back.
I'm takin' him to Williamstown.

361
00:36:28,153 --> 00:36:30,918
They'll keep him down there
till the trial starts.

362
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:34,254
- OK.
- Oh, and Smith?

363
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:38,687
They're gonna convict that Indian
as sure as you're standing there.

364
00:36:44,169 --> 00:36:48,072
Now you're... You're just brimmin' over
with humanity, aren't ya?

365
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:51,769
You can afford all
that humanity stuff, I can't.

366
00:36:51,843 --> 00:36:54,835
After all, I gotta risk my neck
with these people.

367
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:57,539
That's no reason to wanna
hang that boy in there.

368
00:36:57,649 --> 00:37:00,550
Well, he killed Sam Hardy, didn't he?

369
00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:06,285
Way I figure, he...

370
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:08,883
He hit Sam when Sam
pulled that knife of his on 'em.

371
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,191
- Just once too often.
- Well, it killed him. That's enough.

372
00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:15,198
Sam ran up against trouble
he brought on himself.

373
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:18,725
- Aw, Smith...
- Oh, come on. Get off it, will ya?

374
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:22,873
Sam was selling those Indians liquor.
And takin' their money

375
00:37:22,941 --> 00:37:25,137
in that phony card game of his.

376
00:37:29,881 --> 00:37:31,610
Hey, Vince.

377
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:35,385
You coulda moved in there
and stopped it.

378
00:37:36,955 --> 00:37:38,946
Why didn't you?

379
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:44,360
Well, maybe there was a little
money in it on the side for you.

380
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:29,463
That's all right, Joe.
You don't break anything, I think.

381
00:38:31,776 --> 00:38:34,177
Walter Charlie, whose car is this?

382
00:38:35,547 --> 00:38:40,041
My car. I buy this car
to take OI' Antoine to Williamstown

383
00:38:40,118 --> 00:38:42,678
when they have
this trial for Gabriel Jimmyboy.

384
00:38:42,754 --> 00:38:48,557
Now don't tell me where you got
the $499.95 because I know!

385
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:54,327
Hey, Joe, you got a six pack of root
beer for OI' Antoine? He's thirsty.

386
00:38:54,399 --> 00:38:55,958
He no used to automobile.

387
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:11,009
Why'd ya give him the whole $500?

388
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:14,541
He interpret good this trial.

389
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:16,882
Well, what happened to the lawyer?

390
00:39:16,955 --> 00:39:21,483
Walter Charlie, he get lawyer
appoint by Indian Bureau.

391
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:23,389
No charge.

392
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,226
You're a cheap chiseler.

393
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:35,535
- OI' Antoine, he like that car.
- It's not his car. It's your car.

394
00:39:35,607 --> 00:39:38,542
Well, the old man, he no can drive.
What for he want car?

395
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:48,881
Antoine...

396
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:54,152
Just tryin' to be with the buffalo.

397
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:57,954
He's right, Smith.
This car like big wagon.

398
00:39:58,029 --> 00:40:00,623
Go across prairie when
white man hunt buffalo.

399
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:10,001
Oh, boy.

400
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:29,060
Hey, Smith!

401
00:40:29,127 --> 00:40:33,064
Truck no good. Put it away.

402
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:37,060
Walter!

403
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:30,146
- You all right, Antoine?
- Yeah.

404
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:35,020
Come on.

405
00:41:38,863 --> 00:41:41,127
Why you wave me to pass, Smith?

406
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,700
You pretty bum driver, I think.

407
00:41:46,037 --> 00:41:50,372
Hey, Smith! What am I going
to do with this car now?

408
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:52,808
Well, I'll tell you what, Walter.

409
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:56,575
You go get yourself a paddle. You'll
have yourself a nice four wheel canoe.

410
00:42:08,393 --> 00:42:12,489
And six makes a total of $2,300

411
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:14,827
after we sell the beef off.

412
00:42:15,166 --> 00:42:17,157
- Smith?
- Yeah?

413
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:20,460
If we could borrow $500 at the bank...

414
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:23,166
Say, do you think
he'd like a can of sardines?

415
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:24,664
Huh?

416
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:28,736
This package I'm making for Gabriel
Jimmyboy. You think he'd sardines?

417
00:42:28,813 --> 00:42:30,941
You're the one
who thinks like an Indian.

418
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:33,814
I think I'm gonna
put in two cans of sardines...

419
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:35,546
- Smith!
- What?

420
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:38,851
If you'd send for that bulletin
from the Department of Agriculture

421
00:42:38,923 --> 00:42:41,984
- on feed grains...
- How about some of that jam you made?

422
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:45,428
If you would send for that bulletin,
they could tell us how

423
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:48,056
to fatten up the stock quicker
and use less acreage.

424
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:51,124
There's no point in botherin'
the Department of Agriculture.

425
00:42:51,202 --> 00:42:54,866
Besides, I'm running this place
only half as well as I know how.

426
00:42:56,441 --> 00:43:00,776
Well, of course I've got $79
in my disaster fund.

427
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:06,612
But some day,
some distant wonderful day...

428
00:43:07,018 --> 00:43:09,783
...we're all going to take
a fabulous trip.

429
00:43:09,854 --> 00:43:15,657
Smith! Smith! The hay crew
is here! Come on! Come on!

430
00:43:17,028 --> 00:43:20,965
Norah! Will you wrap these up?
I'll mail it this afternoon.

431
00:43:21,032 --> 00:43:24,263
Oh... We're gonna make hay, Norah.

432
00:43:24,635 --> 00:43:29,334
The best feed crop in three years.
They can't stop us now, huh?

433
00:43:55,733 --> 00:43:57,360
Hiya, McDonald!

434
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:01,162
- Where are the tractors?
- Tractors come by and by.

435
00:44:01,239 --> 00:44:04,800
- Your men all ready to go?
- Yeah, sure.

436
00:44:04,876 --> 00:44:07,402
- All right, let's get hoppin' then!
- Yeah, sure.

437
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:10,971
We cut the hay up quick.
We're not gone very long, I think.

438
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:16,911
Gone where?

439
00:44:16,988 --> 00:44:19,787
We go see that trial they got
for Gabriel Jimmyboy.

440
00:44:20,858 --> 00:44:25,557
- You... You... You what?
- We go see that trial. All mens go.

441
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:28,395
OI' Antoine, he go,
Walter Charlie go, everybody go.

442
00:44:28,966 --> 00:44:32,425
- Now you got a hay contract with me.
- Why you don't go, Smith?

443
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,767
- We come back real quick.
- You can't do that.

444
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:38,070
What if the weather breaks and it rains?
I'll lose my whole crop.

445
00:44:38,142 --> 00:44:41,908
It stay hot, Smith. Don't worry.

446
00:44:56,394 --> 00:44:59,659
- Well how about that?
- You can't go, Smith.

447
00:44:59,764 --> 00:45:04,702
I know I can't go.
What am I gonna say to your mother?

448
00:45:05,136 --> 00:45:06,865
Oh, boy.

449
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:11,641
It's not what you're
gonna say to her, Smith.

450
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:14,770
It's what she's gonna
say to you's what matters.

451
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:21,542
Norah?

452
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:25,114
Norah, you can't sleep in the barn.

453
00:45:25,189 --> 00:45:27,283
I'm not sleeping. I'm thinking.

454
00:45:27,358 --> 00:45:29,292
Oh... well.

455
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:32,352
And I don't need
any help from you, Smith.

456
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:37,099
All right. I admit it. I'm...

457
00:45:37,168 --> 00:45:40,399
I'm a terrible rancher always
getting mixed up with the Indians,

458
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:44,635
and I disappear for days
and nobody can find me. And ...

459
00:45:44,709 --> 00:45:48,236
I don't even send for one lousy
Department of Agriculture bulletin

460
00:45:48,312 --> 00:45:51,282
even though they just cost a quarter.
You know. You said it.

461
00:45:51,349 --> 00:45:53,875
Just like you said.

462
00:45:55,019 --> 00:45:56,919
Aw, come on in the house, huh, Norah?

463
00:45:56,988 --> 00:46:00,049
- You left something out.
- What?

464
00:46:00,858 --> 00:46:03,327
You wanna go to that trial
of Gabriel Jimmyboy.

465
00:46:03,394 --> 00:46:06,056
Did I say I wanted to go to any trial?

466
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:09,691
- Why...
- You don't have to. I know you.

467
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:13,965
- Oh, you know me?
- You bet I know you.

468
00:46:15,673 --> 00:46:19,007
- You do, huh?
- Yes, I do, huh.

469
00:46:22,113 --> 00:46:25,845
Come here. Come here...

470
00:46:26,017 --> 00:46:28,042
That's not going to get you anyplace.

471
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:29,177
It used to.

472
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:31,847
Well, we're not
talking about "used to."

473
00:46:33,257 --> 00:46:35,658
Make up your mind.
Wanna go back to your mother

474
00:46:35,726 --> 00:46:37,421
or you wanna go back to the house?

475
00:46:37,495 --> 00:46:41,261
I mean, your mother lives
1,785 miles away from here.

476
00:46:41,332 --> 00:46:43,858
She's already told you
it was a mistake to marry me.

477
00:46:43,934 --> 00:46:49,100
- I should have listened to her.
- Why didn't ya?

478
00:46:49,173 --> 00:46:52,507
She said, "Those good-looking ones,
they haven't got any sense."

479
00:46:52,576 --> 00:46:56,706
They'll sweet-talk you for the rest of
your life, you'll end up with nothing.

480
00:46:56,881 --> 00:47:01,751
I always did admire your mother.
Yeah, I sure did.

481
00:47:02,687 --> 00:47:06,351
- Aw, you're not good for much, Smith.
- Mmm...

482
00:47:06,424 --> 00:47:09,325
- Are you listening?
- Yes, of course.

483
00:47:09,393 --> 00:47:13,489
And all those female idiots in
the village tell me how lucky I am.

484
00:47:13,564 --> 00:47:15,328
Mmm...

485
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:22,171
Oh, Smith...
why did I ever get stuck with you?

486
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:25,332
I don't know.

487
00:47:32,049 --> 00:47:33,312
You get anything yet?

488
00:47:36,587 --> 00:47:39,887
There won't be anything on the radio.
The trial isn't that big.

489
00:47:39,957 --> 00:47:44,485
Yeah, I guess you're right. I'll finish
this up and then get on with the hay.

490
00:47:44,562 --> 00:47:46,724
Oh...

491
00:47:46,797 --> 00:47:49,289
Look what's happening to us.

492
00:47:49,467 --> 00:47:51,799
It's Young Alexander!

493
00:47:54,839 --> 00:47:57,740
Now look, Smith. We've got
an entire hay crop to bring in.

494
00:47:57,842 --> 00:48:00,277
Let's not get bogged down
with an Indian powwow.

495
00:48:00,311 --> 00:48:01,972
Probably just coming to say hello.

496
00:48:04,849 --> 00:48:08,217
- Hello, Young Alexander.
- Oh, conesta!

497
00:48:10,354 --> 00:48:12,618
- Hello, this place.
- Now you see?

498
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:19,753
- Conesta.
- Conesta, Young Alexander.

499
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:23,494
- How goes it?
- Don't go good, Smith.

500
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:26,229
Ol' Antoine,
he send me to talk to you.

501
00:48:26,971 --> 00:48:29,338
He's up at Williamstown,
at the trial, isn't he?

502
00:48:29,407 --> 00:48:33,605
Yeah. Yeah, he go there.
That trial, she start yesterday.

503
00:48:36,447 --> 00:48:39,075
He's gonna speak for
Gabriel Jimmyboy, isn't he?

504
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:43,815
Maybe. Maybe not.
That old man in jail.

505
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:46,352
In jail?

506
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:51,959
Very bad, I think.

507
00:49:12,516 --> 00:49:16,953
What happened? Did Walter Charlie
get Antoine into some kind of trouble?

508
00:49:25,362 --> 00:49:29,731
No. Walter Charlie wait
for OI' Antoine in court.

509
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,735
OI' Antoine go to wrong court.

510
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:37,707
- He go inside, look for Walter Charlie.
- The wrong court?

511
00:49:38,542 --> 00:49:41,375
Somebody call for
Indian named "Abraham."

512
00:49:41,445 --> 00:49:45,313
- Yeah?
- OI' Antoine, he say, "Yes!"

513
00:49:45,683 --> 00:49:50,348
That judge, he call OI' Antoine
up and speak with him.

514
00:49:51,255 --> 00:49:57,058
"Abraham," he say, "These policemen
tell me you get drunk last night."

515
00:49:57,461 --> 00:49:59,054
Oh, dear.

516
00:50:00,397 --> 00:50:06,166
OI' Antoine, he forget speak English.
All he say is, "Yes."

517
00:50:06,737 --> 00:50:09,707
That judge, he got
OI' Antoine in jail for five days.

518
00:50:09,773 --> 00:50:12,071
Well, somebody's gotta
get him outta there.

519
00:50:12,142 --> 00:50:14,907
He's gotta speak
for Gabriel Jimmyboy.

520
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:20,679
What I think, Smith. You pay $10,
OI' Antoine get out of jail.

521
00:50:20,751 --> 00:50:21,741
Me?

522
00:50:21,819 --> 00:50:24,311
Everybody know
he break that horse for you.

523
00:50:24,388 --> 00:50:27,016
You supposed to pay him $20.

524
00:50:27,091 --> 00:50:29,719
Ten and I've already given it to him.

525
00:50:38,669 --> 00:50:41,934
What for you don't pay him
all that money, Smith?

526
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:48,238
<i>Q! Antoine, he shamed.
He ain't never been in jail before.</i>

527
00:50:55,452 --> 00:50:58,444
- What about Gabriel's lawyer?
- Lawyer, he little squirt.

528
00:50:58,556 --> 00:51:01,491
He never try case in big court before.

529
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:07,095
OI' Antoine say, "Go find Smith."

530
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:22,536
- Smith, you can't go.
- I know I can't go.

531
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:27,314
- But you're going.
- Who said I was going?

532
00:51:27,785 --> 00:51:29,583
You'll go.

533
00:51:29,954 --> 00:51:33,219
Ah, stop talking like that!
I got my hay crop to get in.

534
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:35,418
You'll go anyway.

535
00:51:35,693 --> 00:51:38,560
All Indians say, "Find Smith."

536
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:42,888
OI' Antoine has to speak for Gabriel.

537
00:51:44,602 --> 00:51:49,233
- Gabriel's life depends on it.
- All right, go!

538
00:51:50,441 --> 00:51:52,967
Go and don't come back!

539
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:57,574
I'll cut every single
stalk of hay myself...

540
00:51:58,382 --> 00:52:00,146
...with the scissors!

541
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:44,218
- What's this?
- My disaster fund.

542
00:52:44,662 --> 00:52:49,725
Seventy-nine... and change!

543
00:52:51,568 --> 00:52:54,503
Norah, listen, this is
the money for your trip.

544
00:52:54,571 --> 00:52:58,474
It's going for a trip.
You're going to Williamstown,

545
00:52:58,575 --> 00:53:02,512
and you're gonna get OI' Antoine
out of jail and stay for the trial.

546
00:53:03,814 --> 00:53:09,253
Take it, Smith,
before I blow my top.

547
00:53:19,263 --> 00:53:24,201
Smith, if you say something nice,
so help me, I'm going to clock you.

548
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,304
Thanks, Norah.

549
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:36,177
Well, somebody has to take care
of those... those children.

550
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:39,542
Guess we're just gonna have to take
our chances with the hay?

551
00:53:39,616 --> 00:53:43,246
- She stay very hot Smith. Don't worry.
- Well, I won't be gone long.

552
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:45,687
Besides, Albie'll be here
to watch out for ya.

553
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:50,723
No. Albie'll watch out for you.

554
00:53:51,195 --> 00:53:52,287
What?

555
00:53:52,463 --> 00:53:57,264
It's time that he saw how
the world moves. Take him along.

556
00:54:04,842 --> 00:54:07,868
Hey, Albie!

557
00:54:07,945 --> 00:54:10,437
Come on, get dressed!
We're goin' to Williamstown.

558
00:54:26,363 --> 00:54:32,063
Gabriel, a lawyer-client relationship
is strictly confidential.

559
00:54:32,136 --> 00:54:35,470
You can say anything you want.
Anything!

560
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:40,333
- OI' Antoine speak for Gabriel.
- OI' Antoine, yeah.

561
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:43,311
That's just the point.
Who is OI' Antoine?

562
00:54:43,981 --> 00:54:46,473
Why wasn't he in court today?

563
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:50,350
- Oh...
- He come this place by and by.

564
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:52,988
By and by? Huh.

565
00:54:53,257 --> 00:54:55,316
They're gonna convict you before...

566
00:54:58,262 --> 00:55:00,629
Oh, I'm sorry, Gabriel.

567
00:55:02,065 --> 00:55:03,863
I'm sorry.

568
00:55:03,934 --> 00:55:06,096
You're chicken, huh?

569
00:55:07,437 --> 00:55:08,962
What?

570
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:11,440
You don't talk good
to that judge, I think.

571
00:55:12,609 --> 00:55:15,704
Gabriel, that judge
doesn't like it when this lawyer

572
00:55:15,779 --> 00:55:17,679
has to keep asking for an adjournment

573
00:55:17,748 --> 00:55:20,774
because his principle witness
hasn't shown up.

574
00:55:20,851 --> 00:55:25,618
- Don't you understand that?
- Sure. You're chicken.

575
00:55:25,689 --> 00:55:30,388
Well, you're not even telling me
what Antoine knows!

576
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:32,690
I mean, did he see the fight?

577
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:35,763
Was he in that room with you
that night or what?

578
00:55:36,366 --> 00:55:40,633
- He don't tell me what he know.
- You heard the principle witnesses.

579
00:55:40,704 --> 00:55:45,665
They saw Sam Hardy lying on the floor,
dead. And you climbin' out the window.

580
00:55:45,742 --> 00:55:49,406
- Now, isn't that the truth?
- How I know the truth?

581
00:55:49,913 --> 00:55:54,942
Sam give me house bottle of whiskey.
How am I gonna remember all that?

582
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:58,245
Well, Gabriel.

583
00:55:58,488 --> 00:56:04,359
You and I had better pray...
that your OI' Antoine shows up.

584
00:56:04,428 --> 00:56:10,390
'Cause I don't know
how to ask for another adjournment.

585
00:56:10,467 --> 00:56:12,367
I just don't know.

586
00:56:14,304 --> 00:56:17,399
Well, you talk pretty good here.

587
00:56:17,641 --> 00:56:20,576
Why you go to that court
and talk chicken?

588
00:56:39,129 --> 00:56:41,291
- Albie...
- Hmm?

589
00:56:42,499 --> 00:56:46,595
- Now what'd I tell ya, huh?
- Don't do any good, Smith.

590
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:50,664
The closer we get to Williamstown,
the more I get to thinkin' about it.

591
00:56:51,108 --> 00:56:53,805
Will they let
Gabriel Jimmyboy go, Smith?

592
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:56,235
Well, that's up to the jury.

593
00:56:56,914 --> 00:57:01,545
Antoine'll speak for Gabriel.
Antoine'll tell 'em how it happened.

594
00:57:01,618 --> 00:57:04,349
Well, you gotta remember
that Antoine's an old man,

595
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:06,719
and he gets things
kinda mixed up sometimes.

596
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:09,225
- But Sam Hardy went for Gabriel first.
- 1 know.

597
00:57:09,293 --> 00:57:12,160
- Everybody knows that.
- I know. I know, Albie.

598
00:57:12,229 --> 00:57:15,096
They just gotta let Gabriel go, Smith.

599
00:57:15,165 --> 00:57:18,965
Well, they might not. I mean,
there's a lotta people that...

600
00:57:19,036 --> 00:57:21,664
- They just don't like Indians.
- Why?

601
00:57:23,874 --> 00:57:25,865
- Why?
- Indians any different?

602
00:57:26,143 --> 00:57:28,373
- No...
- Peterpaul's my best friend.

603
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:30,573
- I know that.
- Antoine's your best friend.

604
00:57:30,647 --> 00:57:33,309
- So why doesn't anybody like them?
-l

605
00:57:33,884 --> 00:57:37,411
I don't know why.

606
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:43,852
The jury'll believe OI' Antoine, Smith.
They just got to!

607
00:57:45,362 --> 00:57:48,161
I'm sure they will.

608
00:57:48,231 --> 00:57:50,859
You're just saying that, aren't you?

609
00:57:54,104 --> 00:57:55,902
Mmm-hmm.

610
00:57:58,842 --> 00:58:00,742
- Smith?
- Yeah?

611
00:58:00,811 --> 00:58:03,212
I'm glad you always tell me the truth.

612
00:58:07,184 --> 00:58:10,176
Wanna steer some more? Come on.

613
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:15,724
Whoa! Whoa!

614
00:58:38,448 --> 00:58:40,473
- Hey, look, Smith.
- What?

615
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:42,382
What's Vince Heber doing here?

616
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:49,491
Oh, he's a withess for the State.

617
00:58:51,094 --> 00:58:53,825
You mean he saw what happened
on the night in question?

618
00:58:53,897 --> 00:58:57,663
That's what they say in court, I read.

619
00:58:57,768 --> 00:59:00,829
No, he didn't see what happened
on the night in question.

620
00:59:00,871 --> 00:59:03,272
He's gonna tell them
why they arrested Gabriel.

621
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:04,933
- Oh.
- All right?

622
00:59:17,054 --> 00:59:19,682
Right here, Albie. You mind?

623
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:24,216
- Oh.
- Hello, Smith.

624
00:59:24,294 --> 00:59:26,126
Hello, Walter Charlie.

625
00:59:26,196 --> 00:59:28,528
- You come for trial, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

626
00:59:28,765 --> 00:59:31,962
Well, you might as well go home.
Nobody can find OI' Antoine.

627
00:59:32,269 --> 00:59:34,328
Gabriel Jimmyboy guilty for sure now.

628
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:37,772
Oh, we'll find OI' Antoine.
He's in jail.

629
00:59:38,742 --> 00:59:39,937
- Jail?
- Mm-hmm.

630
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:43,207
- Who put him in jail?
- Uh, right.

631
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:45,374
We'll have
two orange juices, please.

632
00:59:45,449 --> 00:59:48,885
- Why nobody tell me about this jail?
- It's a long story, Walter.

633
00:59:48,952 --> 00:59:51,387
And then we'll have
the two eggs with the ham.

634
00:59:51,455 --> 00:59:53,753
Crazy old man!
He no can do this to me!

635
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:57,659
- To you?
- Coffee, tea or milk?

636
00:59:57,727 --> 01:00:00,662
After all the things I did for him?
I buy him an automobile.

637
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:03,256
- I buy him root beer.
- With his own money.

638
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:06,667
- Coffee, tea or milk?
- How come he tell you he in jail?

639
01:00:06,736 --> 01:00:10,536
He no tell me he in jail!
He make me look no good in that court.

640
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:12,632
Oh, I'm sure you'll turn out all right.

641
01:00:12,709 --> 01:00:15,235
Coffee, tea or milk?

642
01:00:15,312 --> 01:00:16,677
- Hmm? Oh.
- Smith!

643
01:00:16,746 --> 01:00:19,977
Excuse me. Uh...
one coffee and one milk.

644
01:00:20,050 --> 01:00:23,645
- Two coffees.
- I said one coffee and one milk.

645
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:26,951
Smith, Ma says I can see
how the world moves.

646
01:00:27,023 --> 01:00:30,391
What Indian people gonna
think about Walter Charlie now?

647
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:33,521
- Two coffees.
- He let OI' Antoine go to jail.

648
01:00:33,597 --> 01:00:37,295
- He no smart fella.
- Don't undersell yourself, Walter.

649
01:00:39,269 --> 01:00:40,896
Why OI' Antoine come to you?

650
01:00:40,971 --> 01:00:45,408
Well, because I'm putting up
$10 to get him out.

651
01:00:46,243 --> 01:00:48,234
Are you willing to put up $107?

652
01:00:53,917 --> 01:00:57,148
Someday, OI' Antoine find out
all the things I do for him.

653
01:00:57,254 --> 01:00:59,416
Oh, yes, I'm sure.

654
01:01:04,294 --> 01:01:07,821
That's OK, Smith. You bring
OI' Antoine to this court.

655
01:01:08,465 --> 01:01:10,661
Maybe I interpret
for him good anyway.

656
01:01:10,734 --> 01:01:12,793
Well, thanks a lot.

657
01:01:14,938 --> 01:01:17,635
I sure hope he interprets
good for OI' Antoine.

658
01:01:17,707 --> 01:01:20,267
Well, it's a rare
Indian you can't trust, Albie.

659
01:01:20,443 --> 01:01:23,105
Is that something I should
remember, Smith?

660
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:26,013
Yeah, I think that's
something you should remember.

661
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:32,714
What's so funny, Geronimo?

662
01:01:34,024 --> 01:01:35,719
You looking for trouble?

663
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:39,618
Oh, no...

664
01:01:41,965 --> 01:01:44,627
You got something to say,
you say it in English.

665
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:47,671
Hey, fella. When he
gets scared he talks his language.

666
01:01:47,737 --> 01:01:50,604
- He apologized to you.
- How am I supposed to know that?

667
01:01:50,674 --> 01:01:53,700
Harry, there's a guy outside
gonna beat up Walter Charlie.

668
01:01:53,777 --> 01:01:57,111
They don't understand.
You gotta get out of here.

669
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:59,740
You leave that man alone
or I'll smash your face in!

670
01:01:59,849 --> 01:02:01,647
- What?
- I'm sick and tired

671
01:02:01,685 --> 01:02:03,619
of you guys picking on these Indians.

672
01:02:03,687 --> 01:02:06,748
Oh, now just a minute...

673
01:02:06,856 --> 01:02:10,383
Hey, Harry!
This guy's the Indian's friend!

674
01:02:12,062 --> 01:02:15,088
Cool it! Now listen to me!

675
01:02:16,233 --> 01:02:19,168
Listen!
The guy's the Indian's friend!

676
01:02:28,178 --> 01:02:33,708
Hey, you should have told me
you were a friend of Walter Charlie's.

677
01:02:33,783 --> 01:02:37,151
- Hey, I'm sorry, pal.
- No hard feelings, all right?

678
01:02:39,456 --> 01:02:40,753
Yeah.

679
01:02:52,002 --> 01:02:54,733
Good thing you didn't
lose your temper, Smith.

680
01:02:54,804 --> 01:02:57,136
You might've hurt that guy.

681
01:03:05,749 --> 01:03:08,377
I got something else
for you to remember, Albie.

682
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:09,577
What's that?

683
01:03:09,653 --> 01:03:12,554
There's only two times
you get in trouble with Indians:

684
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:15,216
The first time is
when you try to hurt them...

685
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:18,651
Second time is
when you try to help them.

686
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:27,133
The Superior Court
for the State of Idaho

687
01:03:27,203 --> 01:03:29,797
for the county of Clearwater
is now called to order.

688
01:03:29,873 --> 01:03:32,706
The Honorable Judge
James C. Brown presiding.

689
01:03:33,543 --> 01:03:35,705
Remain seated, please.

690
01:03:38,148 --> 01:03:41,778
Mr. Maxwell.

691
01:03:43,086 --> 01:03:45,487
Your Honor, I...

692
01:03:46,389 --> 01:03:48,881
...find myself in a most
difficult position.

693
01:03:48,958 --> 01:03:51,188
Again, Mr. Maxwell?

694
01:03:51,261 --> 01:03:55,255
Well, I'm sorry, Your Honor, but there
are circumstances beyond my control.

695
01:03:55,332 --> 01:03:57,824
Chicken.

696
01:03:57,934 --> 01:04:00,369
Does the defendant wish
to address the court?

697
01:04:00,403 --> 01:04:04,362
No, Your Honor. He's merely trying
to explain himself in his native tongue.

698
01:04:04,441 --> 01:04:08,605
Sounded to me like he said "chicken.”

699
01:04:10,013 --> 01:04:14,644
Your Honor, may we make a statement of
the prosecution's position at this time?

700
01:04:14,718 --> 01:04:17,688
- Yes, Mr. Edwards.
- Your Honor,

701
01:04:17,754 --> 01:04:21,884
the jury has endured
numerous postponements

702
01:04:21,958 --> 01:04:25,326
while we wait for the defendant's
principal witness...

703
01:04:25,762 --> 01:04:28,754
..., uh, perhaps, mythical entity,

704
01:04:28,832 --> 01:04:32,234
referred to only as "Antoine."

705
01:04:33,436 --> 01:04:35,803
OI' Antoine can't talk
for me this place.

706
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:39,570
Your Honor, the government
has presented its principal witnesses:

707
01:04:39,642 --> 01:04:42,771
Mr. Thomas and Mr. Gilbert,
who were present at the pool room

708
01:04:42,846 --> 01:04:44,177
on the night in question.

709
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:50,179
Mr. Heber, who gave evidence
of identity, and Dr. Rhodes,

710
01:04:50,253 --> 01:04:54,019
who testified as to the nature
of the blow that killed Sam Hardy.

711
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:58,687
I object, Your Honor! It has not been
established that the cause of death

712
01:04:58,795 --> 01:05:01,025
was a blow on the head
or an accidental fall.

713
01:05:01,064 --> 01:05:02,088
Sustained.

714
01:05:04,467 --> 01:05:08,495
Your Honor,
we see no reason for further delay.

715
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:11,666
Many of these jurymen are ranchers!

716
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:13,266
And this is haying time.

717
01:05:13,343 --> 01:05:16,938
Mr. Edwards, a man's
on trial here for his life.

718
01:05:17,013 --> 01:05:19,573
We're not concerned
with bringing in a hay crop.

719
01:05:21,618 --> 01:05:22,642
Yes, Your Honor.

720
01:05:32,896 --> 01:05:34,830
I'm sorry, Mac.
No more spectators.

721
01:05:34,898 --> 01:05:36,593
We're not spectators, Sergeant.

722
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:39,966
The judge said don't let nobody in
until there's a recess.

723
01:05:40,103 --> 01:05:42,663
We got too many Indians now,
so why don't you and...

724
01:05:43,306 --> 01:05:45,934
- Hey! Hey, you!
- OI' Antoine come now.

725
01:05:46,009 --> 01:05:48,205
Speak for Gabriel.

726
01:05:48,278 --> 01:05:50,975
I'm, uh, sorry, Your Honor.
He slipped right by me.

727
01:05:51,047 --> 01:05:55,883
Well, Sergeant, that's all right.
Bring him up here to the bench.

728
01:06:08,331 --> 01:06:09,628
Are you Antoine?

729
01:06:13,336 --> 01:06:16,772
Sergeant, I think we'll require
the court interpreter.

730
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:18,899
Let the witness wait
at the counsel table.

731
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:20,340
Yes, Your Honor.

732
01:06:27,350 --> 01:06:29,819
Mr. Maxwell, you wish
to confer with the witness?

733
01:06:29,886 --> 01:06:34,016
Yes, Your Honor, I think I'd better.

734
01:06:37,527 --> 01:06:41,555
All right, Gabriel, have Antoine
tell me everything he knows.

735
01:06:52,275 --> 01:06:53,436
What'd he say?

736
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:56,172
He say they give him no good
breakfast in that jail.

737
01:06:56,246 --> 01:06:57,839
He no eat.

738
01:06:58,481 --> 01:07:01,007
We're sorry about that.

739
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:06,748
Gabriel, ask him to
please tell me everything he knows,

740
01:07:06,823 --> 01:07:10,657
exactly what happened on the night
that Sam Hardy was killed.

741
01:07:16,165 --> 01:07:17,189
What'd he say?

742
01:07:17,267 --> 01:07:22,569
He say, food like that, he glad
he no has to stay in that jail too long.

743
01:07:27,744 --> 01:07:30,577
Mr. Maxwell,
ready to swear in the witness?

744
01:07:34,684 --> 01:07:37,153
I'm afraid so, Your Honor.

745
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:41,054
Will the court interpreter ask the
witness to take the stand, please?

746
01:07:44,761 --> 01:07:47,662
Ol' Antoine?

747
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:07,507
Do you swear to tell the truth, the
whole truth, and nothing but the truth,

748
01:08:07,584 --> 01:08:10,815
50 help you God?

749
01:08:16,359 --> 01:08:18,555
Uh-huh.

750
01:08:22,165 --> 01:08:25,533
He say OK.

751
01:08:41,651 --> 01:08:43,915
Now, Antoine...

752
01:08:43,987 --> 01:08:47,685
You do understand
why you're here today, don't you?

753
01:08:59,402 --> 01:09:03,964
He say, "I speak for all Indian people.”

754
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:08,841
Yes, of course.
You talk to the Indian people,

755
01:09:08,911 --> 01:09:11,608
but you will also talk to His Honor

756
01:09:11,681 --> 01:09:15,584
and to these gentlemen
on the jury, Antoine.

757
01:09:24,894 --> 01:09:27,829
Good. Now, Antoine...

758
01:09:29,365 --> 01:09:32,824
Take your time
and please tell this court

759
01:09:32,902 --> 01:09:38,170
all that you know about what happened
on the night of August the 14th.

760
01:10:09,605 --> 01:10:12,939
He say he's going to speak
of the time when he was a young man

761
01:10:13,009 --> 01:10:17,378
with Chief Joseph and they fought
the white savage in Montana.

762
01:10:22,418 --> 01:10:26,514
Your Honor, I don't see how
an anecdote that goes back 90 years

763
01:10:26,589 --> 01:10:31,755
to the battles of an Indian chief,
however famous, is relevant here.

764
01:10:31,828 --> 01:10:37,733
Mr. Maxwell... see if your witness
can be more responsive to the question.

765
01:10:38,468 --> 01:10:40,527
I'll try, Your Honor.

766
01:10:41,571 --> 01:10:44,268
Antoine...

767
01:10:44,607 --> 01:10:49,374
I'm sure that these people are
interested in hearing about Chief Joseph

768
01:10:49,445 --> 01:10:52,676
and white savages...

769
01:10:59,455 --> 01:11:05,451
But we're concerned, today,
with the trial of Gabriel Jimmyboy.

770
01:11:05,661 --> 01:11:07,891
Now, he's accused of murder.

771
01:11:09,465 --> 01:11:13,959
Antoine, could you please,
in your own way,

772
01:11:15,438 --> 01:11:21,070
tell this court about what
you know on August the 14th?

773
01:11:45,201 --> 01:11:47,602
Well, what'd he say there,
Mr. Walter Charlie?

774
01:11:51,574 --> 01:11:54,009
He... He said...

775
01:11:55,645 --> 01:12:00,139
He remembered the time Chief Joseph
spoke to him. He remembered very well.

776
01:12:00,249 --> 01:12:03,048
Why don't you speak up?
Just speak up! We can't hear you.

777
01:12:04,821 --> 01:12:08,655
He said he remembered the time
Chief Joseph spoke to him, and...

778
01:12:22,305 --> 01:12:23,864
- Hey, Vince?
- Yeah?

779
01:12:24,407 --> 01:12:25,966
Why don't you give
the old man a break?

780
01:12:26,042 --> 01:12:27,874
Yeah.

781
01:12:28,077 --> 01:12:31,240
When does he start his war dance?

782
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:35,473
- You think that's funny, huh?
- Sure it is.

783
01:12:35,551 --> 01:12:37,918
The old man's out of his mind!

784
01:12:38,321 --> 01:12:40,449
Let's you and I step outside right now.

785
01:12:40,523 --> 01:12:43,424
Corporal, corporal,
bring that man to the bench.

786
01:12:49,098 --> 01:12:51,965
All right. All right...

787
01:12:56,105 --> 01:12:58,164
Why don't you do your job?

788
01:12:59,242 --> 01:13:02,337
- Who's this cowboy, corporal?
- He's a rancher, Your Honor...

789
01:13:02,411 --> 01:13:05,403
Just a minute. That's right,
I'm a rancher. My name is Smith,

790
01:13:05,481 --> 01:13:07,745
and I'm a friend
of this gentleman here.

791
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:10,311
He has a right
to say his piece.

792
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:12,878
Say "Your Honor" when
you're addressing the court.

793
01:13:12,955 --> 01:13:16,619
You aware it's a serious offense to
interrupt the business of this court?

794
01:13:16,692 --> 01:13:18,820
Yes, I'm very much aware.

795
01:13:18,895 --> 01:13:23,332
But I don't see why these people keep
laughing at him, laughing and laughing!

796
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:25,424
- Why...
- Any more laughter,

797
01:13:25,501 --> 01:13:29,301
I'll clear the court, Mr. Smith.
Go on back to your seat now.

798
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:32,898
- Thank you.
- Smith?

799
01:13:36,512 --> 01:13:40,005
He wants to speak to me, Your Honor.

800
01:13:41,684 --> 01:13:45,177
Well, Mr. Maxwell, it's your witness.

801
01:13:46,789 --> 01:13:51,283
- I have no objection, Your Honor.
- All right?

802
01:14:04,373 --> 01:14:08,401
He wants Smith to interpret for him!

803
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:15,648
Well, what else did he say?

804
01:14:16,652 --> 01:14:20,885
He said... Smith is like his own son.

805
01:14:22,658 --> 01:14:24,524
He speaks his heart.

806
01:14:28,030 --> 01:14:29,964
I'll do my best.

807
01:14:30,032 --> 01:14:32,967
Smith friend to Indian people.
He interpret for OI' Antoine.

808
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:37,601
- We want Smith!
- Sit down...

809
01:14:40,076 --> 01:14:43,410
Mr. Maxwell, you may ask
for a recess, if you wish.

810
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:48,578
If it please the court, we'll, uh,
we'll accept Mr. Smith as interpreter.

811
01:14:48,651 --> 01:14:52,110
Mr. Edwards, this, uh,
agreeable with the prosecution?

812
01:14:53,356 --> 01:14:58,192
Well, we will agree, Your Honor,
if the first interpreter remains

813
01:14:58,294 --> 01:15:00,092
in the courtroom for verification.

814
01:15:00,129 --> 01:15:05,124
Mr. Walter Charlie,
remain and listen to the testimony.

815
01:15:14,443 --> 01:15:17,435
Swear in Mr. Smith as the interpreter.

816
01:15:23,185 --> 01:15:26,246
Do you swear you'll make a true
interpretation in the language

817
01:15:26,322 --> 01:15:30,088
the witness understands and interpret
his answers correctly in English?

818
01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:31,558
I do.

819
01:15:33,696 --> 01:15:36,427
Mr. Maxwell, may I make a suggestion?

820
01:15:36,899 --> 01:15:40,529
Why don't you let the old gentleman
tell his story in his own way,

821
01:15:40,603 --> 01:15:43,334
and I'll stop him
if there's anything improper?

822
01:15:43,406 --> 01:15:46,341
Yes, sir.
I'd like nothing better.

823
01:15:49,278 --> 01:15:53,715
Now, Antoine... you must tell us

824
01:15:53,783 --> 01:15:56,809
all that you know about this case.

825
01:15:57,486 --> 01:16:00,353
This is the law, Antoine.

826
01:16:03,692 --> 01:16:07,959
. law.

827
01:16:15,438 --> 01:16:18,100
He says the law is a very hard thing.

828
01:16:27,383 --> 01:16:32,844
The law is a very cold thing.
We cannot understand the law.

829
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:36,422
Antoine...

830
01:16:37,493 --> 01:16:41,555
...you must tell us all that
you know about Gabriel Jimmyboy.

831
01:16:42,631 --> 01:16:47,569
...Jimmyboy.

832
01:16:54,977 --> 01:16:57,446
"I remember that day very well."

833
01:16:58,080 --> 01:16:59,605
Yeah...

834
01:17:02,952 --> 01:17:05,819
"Yes, I remember that day very well "

835
01:17:19,068 --> 01:17:22,527
"I was in Bearpaw country,
in that place, Montana.

836
01:17:23,939 --> 01:17:26,704
All around us in the
snow hills are the white soldiers."

837
01:17:34,283 --> 01:17:36,843
"We came to that place
to hear Chief Joseph.

838
01:17:36,919 --> 01:17:39,411
He waits for us on saddlehorse."

839
01:17:53,569 --> 01:17:55,435
"Hear me, my chiefs!"

840
01:18:07,816 --> 01:18:12,515
"Once again the white savage
has broken his promise to us.

841
01:18:12,588 --> 01:18:15,580
He has driven us from the valley
that was said to be ours."

842
01:18:29,171 --> 01:18:31,640
"We have marched
a thousand miles...

843
01:18:31,707 --> 01:18:35,541
The chiefs, the braves,
the women and the children."

844
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:54,593
"We have fought the soldiers
four times our number.

845
01:18:55,230 --> 01:18:58,495
A thousand miles of killing
lays behind us."

846
01:19:24,026 --> 01:19:26,961
"I am tired of fighting.

847
01:19:27,029 --> 01:19:32,866
All the old men have
been killed by the white savages.

848
01:19:34,003 --> 01:19:39,100
The chief who led the young men is dead.
Tuhutset is dead.

849
01:19:39,975 --> 01:19:41,943
Looking Glass is dead."

850
01:19:59,695 --> 01:20:01,322
"We can fight no more.

851
01:20:02,264 --> 01:20:06,223
Our people are cold
and there's no blankets.

852
01:20:06,969 --> 01:20:10,166
Our people are hungry
and there is no meat."

853
01:20:20,616 --> 01:20:24,314
"I want to ride off
into the snow hills...

854
01:20:24,386 --> 01:20:27,014
...to look for my children."

855
01:20:35,297 --> 01:20:38,164
"Maybe I will find them dead.”

856
01:21:15,371 --> 01:21:20,434
"Hear me, my chiefs. I am tired.

857
01:21:21,243 --> 01:21:24,873
My heart is sick and sad.

858
01:21:25,514 --> 01:21:28,279
From where the sun now stands,

859
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:33,120
we will fight no more, forever."

860
01:22:01,817 --> 01:22:04,514
An... Antoine...

861
01:22:06,121 --> 01:22:08,283
Thank you for coming here,

862
01:22:08,357 --> 01:22:14,319
and thank you for talking
for your friend, Gabriel Jimmyboy.

863
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:20,835
No cross-examination, Your Honor.

864
01:22:23,806 --> 01:22:27,208
Antoine, you may go now.

865
01:22:49,565 --> 01:22:52,967
You old fool.
He ought to be put away.

866
01:22:58,941 --> 01:23:00,739
What did you say?

867
01:23:01,844 --> 01:23:05,644
How long did it take you
to figure out that routine, huh?

868
01:23:06,048 --> 01:23:08,676
You and Chief Joseph...

869
01:23:14,323 --> 01:23:19,022
How.
We ain't no more gonna fight nobody.

870
01:23:37,846 --> 01:23:39,575
Sergeant, clear the court!

871
01:23:39,648 --> 01:23:41,173
All right, clear the court!

872
01:23:41,250 --> 01:23:43,446
Clear the court!

873
01:23:43,519 --> 01:23:47,080
Corporal, bring Mr. Smith
to my chambers.

874
01:23:47,756 --> 01:23:50,225
- All right, move along!
- Albie!

875
01:23:50,292 --> 01:23:52,852
Albie, you stay with McDonald, there.

876
01:23:52,928 --> 01:23:54,225
Come on, move along!

877
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:04,931
McDonald, what are
they gonna do to Smith?

878
01:24:05,007 --> 01:24:08,307
I don't know.
We'll wait a little bit outside.

879
01:24:08,377 --> 01:24:09,811
Somebody tell us.

880
01:24:10,879 --> 01:24:14,315
Ma's gonna blow her top
when she hears about this one.

881
01:24:16,885 --> 01:24:22,255
Mr. Smith, for contempt of court,
you are fined $50,

882
01:24:22,324 --> 01:24:25,191
or, in default,
30 days' imprisonment.

883
01:24:25,494 --> 01:24:27,895
- $50, huh?
- That's all.

884
01:24:27,963 --> 01:24:31,058
Well, it's a lot
of money, but it was...

885
01:24:31,133 --> 01:24:32,532
It was sure worth it.

886
01:24:32,601 --> 01:24:33,932
- Where do I pay?
- Here...

887
01:24:34,002 --> 01:24:36,664
Just a moment, Corporal,
just a moment.

888
01:24:36,872 --> 01:24:39,637
I beg your pardon, Mr. Smith,
did you say it was "worth it?"

889
01:24:40,275 --> 01:24:43,176
Yeah. Well, I mean,
in a manner of speaking.

890
01:24:43,445 --> 01:24:46,210
'Course my wife's
not gonna like it at all, but...

891
01:24:46,515 --> 01:24:50,543
I sure got my money's worth.

892
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:57,425
In other words, you consider
the fine as a rental fee for staging

893
01:24:57,526 --> 01:25:02,157
- a violent altercation in my court?
- No, I wouldn't say that. I mean...

894
01:25:02,197 --> 01:25:03,722
It...

895
01:25:03,799 --> 01:25:07,292
For further contempt of court,
there'll be an additional penalty of

896
01:25:07,369 --> 01:25:10,498
30 days imprisonment,
without option of fine.

897
01:25:17,479 --> 01:25:20,676
Thirty days, at haying time?

898
01:25:20,749 --> 01:25:23,616
Oh, man, that's really rough,
Your Honor.

899
01:25:23,685 --> 01:25:26,814
- Take the prisoner away.
- No, wait a minute. I...

900
01:25:27,923 --> 01:25:32,952
Listen, I got, yeah, I got $13 left.
Couldn't we make some sort of a deal?

901
01:25:34,730 --> 01:25:39,031
Perhaps you'd like to rent my court
for another quick go at the sheriff?

902
01:25:40,936 --> 01:25:42,267
I---

903
01:25:43,038 --> 01:25:47,168
Man, I just
gotta get that hay crop in. I...

904
01:25:47,376 --> 01:25:52,371
I'm sorry, Mr. Smith. Now, you brought
this on yourself, definitely.

905
01:25:52,948 --> 01:25:54,780
Take the prisoner away, corporal.

906
01:26:07,629 --> 01:26:10,326
Smith!

907
01:26:14,469 --> 01:26:15,698
Uh...

908
01:26:16,471 --> 01:26:20,704
Albie, I'm gonna be tied up here
in Williamstown for about 30 days.

909
01:26:20,776 --> 01:26:23,211
- Thirty days? At haying time?
- Yeah.

910
01:26:23,278 --> 01:26:26,976
Uh, yeah. Well, that's
what I told the judge, but...

911
01:26:27,049 --> 01:26:30,986
Mind taking my truck and asking
your boy if he'd drive Albie home?

912
01:26:31,053 --> 01:26:33,078
- OK, Smith.
- Fine.

913
01:26:33,155 --> 01:26:36,614
Now, you tell your mom not to worry
about a thing, because...

914
01:26:36,692 --> 01:26:40,094
Oh, here's the money I have left.
I've got...

915
01:26:40,162 --> 01:26:41,527
Right here. Now...

916
01:26:41,596 --> 01:26:44,429
Oh, come on, now.
Don't look so sad here.

917
01:26:44,499 --> 01:26:48,436
Soon as I get home, me and OI' Antoine,
we'll break the Appaloosa for ya.

918
01:26:48,570 --> 01:26:49,799
OK?

919
01:26:51,773 --> 01:26:52,865
Yeah.

920
01:26:53,475 --> 01:26:56,809
- Take care of him, huh?
- Come on, Smith.

921
01:26:59,114 --> 01:27:03,051
Don't worry, Smith. When that trial
over, we go back and cut your hay.

922
01:27:03,118 --> 01:27:05,951
She stay hot, Smith. Don't worry.

923
01:27:11,660 --> 01:27:13,822
Where did you get that Indian?

924
01:27:14,763 --> 01:27:17,061
Uh...

925
01:27:17,799 --> 01:27:20,894
Well...
I'd like to take credit for him,

926
01:27:20,969 --> 01:27:24,132
but I think in the final analysis,
he found me.

927
01:27:25,373 --> 01:27:26,738
Well...

928
01:27:28,477 --> 01:27:32,141
- Congratulations, anyhow.
- Isn't it a little early for that?

929
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:35,739
When you've been around as long
as I have, you know when you've lost.

930
01:27:35,817 --> 01:27:39,515
I must say it's the first time
in about four years.

931
01:27:40,655 --> 01:27:42,714
Oh, you're putting me on!

932
01:27:42,791 --> 01:27:45,260
You haven't even made
your final summation yet.

933
01:27:45,327 --> 01:27:47,318
Oh, but you've made yours.

934
01:27:49,097 --> 01:27:52,294
That was the best plea
for self-defense I ever heard.

935
01:27:54,069 --> 01:27:56,663
Come on, I'll let you buy me lunch...

936
01:27:59,941 --> 01:28:02,376
It's the least you can do.

937
01:28:03,145 --> 01:28:04,306
Oh.

938
01:28:38,113 --> 01:28:43,142
Too bad Smith isn't here. He'd like to
hear them singing for Gabriel Jimmyboy.

939
01:28:44,019 --> 01:28:47,114
I don't know what Mom's gonna
think when I get home without him.

940
01:28:47,189 --> 01:28:49,783
You tell her OI' Antoine
make big speech.

941
01:28:49,858 --> 01:28:52,725
- Judge let Gabriel Jimmyboy go.
- Uh-uh.

942
01:28:52,794 --> 01:28:55,126
Not the judge, the jury.

943
01:28:55,330 --> 01:28:59,096
They let him go on account of
self-defense on the night in question.

944
01:29:03,471 --> 01:29:05,769
I guess I gotta go home now.

945
01:29:14,683 --> 01:29:18,847
- How long are they gonna keep singin'?
- Long as everybody happy.

946
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:21,651
What about Smith's hay crop?

947
01:29:21,723 --> 01:29:24,283
Don't worry.
They only happy little while.

948
01:29:24,359 --> 01:29:27,488
OK.

949
01:29:27,562 --> 01:29:29,189
Likewise!

950
01:29:41,176 --> 01:29:43,611
Mr. Maxwell,
state your request.

951
01:29:43,678 --> 01:29:47,308
Your Honor, we would like to ask for
a re-hearing in the case of Mr. Smith.

952
01:29:48,149 --> 01:29:49,412
Yes.

953
01:29:49,484 --> 01:29:53,512
Corporal, do I understand that Antoine
has been sitting on the courthouse steps

954
01:29:53,588 --> 01:29:56,558
- for the last two days and nights?
- That's right, Your Honor.

955
01:29:56,625 --> 01:29:59,686
And he says he's gonna stay there
until Mr. Smith is released.

956
01:30:01,596 --> 01:30:03,291
Smith good man.

957
01:30:04,933 --> 01:30:08,198
Longtime friend of Indian people.

958
01:30:09,938 --> 01:30:12,532
He speaks English, Mr. Maxwell.

959
01:30:12,607 --> 01:30:17,135
Antoine, uh... You speak English?

960
01:30:18,079 --> 01:30:21,379
Uh, yes, Your Honor.
Off and on. More or less.

961
01:30:22,918 --> 01:30:28,584
It's against the law for you to sit on
the courthouse steps for 30 days?

962
01:30:33,595 --> 01:30:38,533
- What does that mean?
- Courthouse steps very hard, judge.

963
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:40,398
I sit on the grass.

964
01:30:42,003 --> 01:30:44,631
Uh, Mr. Maxwell...

965
01:30:44,706 --> 01:30:48,836
...will you vouch for the good behavior
of Mr. Smith henceforth?

966
01:30:49,010 --> 01:30:52,344
From my discussion with him,
I certainly will, Your Honor.

967
01:30:54,149 --> 01:30:57,813
- I'll consider a re-hearing.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

968
01:30:59,688 --> 01:31:03,784
Now, will you gentlemen excuse me?
I'd like to talk to Antoine.

969
01:31:03,858 --> 01:31:05,792
Yes, sir.

970
01:31:05,860 --> 01:31:07,350
Thank you.

971
01:31:11,066 --> 01:31:14,400
Antoine, now tell me,

972
01:31:14,469 --> 01:31:17,564
were you really there
with Chief Joseph?

973
01:31:22,844 --> 01:31:27,145
Yes, yes, Antoine.
Well, let me put it this way...

974
01:31:28,249 --> 01:31:30,843
Now, if I were to release Mr. Smith,

975
01:31:30,919 --> 01:31:33,911
could you and I possibly manage
to talk in English?

976
01:31:34,889 --> 01:31:38,655
You let Smith go, we talk plenty.

977
01:31:57,078 --> 01:32:00,241
Whoa!

978
01:32:01,149 --> 01:32:06,178
Oh, Albie, it sounded like such
a good idea last night, didn't it?

979
01:32:06,254 --> 01:32:07,813
We'll make it, Ma.

980
01:32:07,889 --> 01:32:11,052
We can cut the rest
of this section before dark.

981
01:32:11,126 --> 01:32:14,653
Oh, why did they have
to put Smith in the pokey?

982
01:32:15,163 --> 01:32:17,860
You're gonna miss him, huh?

983
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:21,599
Yeah, me, too,
but we'll surprise him.

984
01:32:22,437 --> 01:32:25,805
Aw, no. We'll never get this field
in before the weather breaks.

985
01:32:25,874 --> 01:32:28,502
Something will happen.
The mower will give up

986
01:32:28,576 --> 01:32:30,840
or the horse will go lame or...

987
01:32:30,912 --> 01:32:33,847
The rain will come down out
of a clear blue sky.

988
01:32:39,621 --> 01:32:42,784
It's Smith! Smith!

989
01:32:47,695 --> 01:32:49,720
Smith! Smith!

990
01:32:54,803 --> 01:32:57,135
- What happened, Smith?
- I got a re-hearing.

991
01:32:57,205 --> 01:32:59,196
The judge let me off!

992
01:33:06,648 --> 01:33:10,107
He got a re-hearing,
Ma, and the judge let him off!

993
01:33:10,185 --> 01:33:13,086
Get down off there, woman.
I'm taking over.

994
01:33:13,154 --> 01:33:15,714
You stay away from me,
you jailbird!

995
01:33:15,790 --> 01:33:17,986
I started this field
and I'm gonna finish it!

996
01:33:18,059 --> 01:33:22,189
- Ma, you missed Smith!
- Be quiet, Albie!

997
01:33:22,864 --> 01:33:25,595
Get away from those horses!
I've got work to do!

998
01:33:25,667 --> 01:33:29,604
When I was sitting in jail, I did some
thinking. Know what we're gonna do?

999
01:33:29,671 --> 01:33:34,700
Oh, Smith! Everything that we own
is riding on this hay crop!

1000
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:36,600
I know.

1001
01:33:36,678 --> 01:33:39,170
And I can't trust you
to even finish the mowing!

1002
01:33:39,247 --> 01:33:42,239
- That's right, I'm irresponsible.
- You are!

1003
01:33:42,317 --> 01:33:46,515
- You get into fights, You run off...
- Yeah. Yeah.

1004
01:33:46,588 --> 01:33:49,285
You work yourself
into a lather over the Indians!

1005
01:33:49,357 --> 01:33:51,052
Right, right, right.

1006
01:33:52,961 --> 01:33:58,127
Oh, Smith. I did miss you.

1007
01:33:59,734 --> 01:34:02,396
Of course you did. Now, come on.

1008
01:34:10,411 --> 01:34:15,008
Ma! Smith! Look!

1009
01:34:15,083 --> 01:34:18,917
- What in the...?
- Indians.

1010
01:34:18,987 --> 01:34:24,721
- I don't believe it.
- Indians with beautiful hay mowers!

1011
01:34:27,996 --> 01:34:30,465
Smith, can me and Peterpaul
help with our mower?

1012
01:34:30,532 --> 01:34:33,729
- Yes.
- Peterpaul!

1013
01:34:39,774 --> 01:34:43,039
- Come on, let's cut the hay!
- Giddyap!

1014
01:34:46,481 --> 01:34:52,045
Move it, Young Alexander!
We almost got ya!

1015
01:34:58,359 --> 01:35:01,260
- McDonald!
- We're gonna cut your hay, Smith.

1016
01:35:01,329 --> 01:35:04,993
We're gonna get it all finished.
You have supper for hungry people?

1017
01:35:05,066 --> 01:35:08,468
Oh, you can eat the place bare!
I'll get everything ready!

1018
01:35:11,406 --> 01:35:12,840
Smith?

1019
01:35:13,808 --> 01:35:15,572
I think we're gonna make it this year.

1020
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:50,071
Now you see, Smith?
No good to worry about hay.

1021
01:35:51,312 --> 01:35:54,407
McDonald, he come cut,
just like he tell you.

1022
01:35:55,850 --> 01:36:00,117
I stay here and
break that horse for the boy.

1023
01:36:00,221 --> 01:36:05,284
- You mean today? Now?
- Sure.

1024
01:36:05,627 --> 01:36:07,152
Smith...

1025
01:36:08,429 --> 01:36:10,796
...is good friend of Indian people.

1026
01:36:14,369 --> 01:36:16,497
All Indian people say,

1027
01:36:16,571 --> 01:36:21,805
"Smith is like big tree

1028
01:36:21,876 --> 01:36:27,280
out in the grass
when the sun is very hot."

1029
01:36:31,319 --> 01:36:33,310
Is that what they say?

1030
01:36:35,857 --> 01:36:36,847
Yeah.

1031
01:36:41,396 --> 01:36:47,096
Gonna be good day tomorrow, Smith.
That hay dry pretty quick, I think.

1032
01:36:47,835 --> 01:36:51,294
You're right, OI' Antoine. It certainly
looks like a good day tomorrow.
