1
00:00:12,662 --> 00:00:16,582
there's a hound dog
out in Texas

2
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:20,319
he says he belongs to me

3
00:00:20,386 --> 00:00:24,323
when he's on the trail
I can follow his tail

4
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,160
through the land
of the wild country

5
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:32,364
he was born to roam
the mountains

6
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:35,868
the prairie land so free

7
00:00:35,936 --> 00:00:40,089
he can go anywhere
run the fat from a bear

8
00:00:40,156 --> 00:00:44,560
chase a bobcat
to his mountain lair

9
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:48,397
or run him up a tree

10
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:51,901
in the land
of the wild country

11
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:55,638
I call my hound dog
Savage Sam

12
00:00:55,705 --> 00:00:59,792
he runs so wild and free

13
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:03,896
and if he don't know
where I am

14
00:01:03,964 --> 00:01:07,366
he takes after me

15
00:01:07,433 --> 00:01:11,236
through the land
of the wild country

16
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:15,107
we were born
to love the country

17
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:19,094
old Savage Sam and me

18
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:23,082
we were born in the west
in the land that's best

19
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,919
but folks out here
never get much rest

20
00:01:26,987 --> 00:01:30,656
with dogs
and boys like me

21
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:34,427
in the land
of the wild country

22
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:39,164
I call my hound dog
Savage Sam

23
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:43,435
he runs so wild
and free

24
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:47,106
and if he don't know
where I am

25
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:51,126
he takes after me

26
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:54,429
through the land
of the wild country

27
00:01:54,497 --> 00:01:58,133
we were born
to love the country

28
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:02,104
old Savage Sam and me

29
00:02:02,172 --> 00:02:06,425
we were born in the west
in the land that's best

30
00:02:06,492 --> 00:02:09,995
but folks out here
never get much rest

31
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:13,065
with dogs
and boys like me

32
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:19,955
in the land
of the wild country

33
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:32,761
Sam, you thievin' rascal,

34
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:34,897
You better
let me have that.

35
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,934
A little savage, ain't ya?

36
00:03:39,002 --> 00:03:41,236
Old Savage Sam.

37
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:43,738
All right, keep it.

38
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:47,142
But I tell you, if Travis catches
you with that side of meat,

39
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:51,080
He's just liable to knock you
Sky west and crooked.

40
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:18,156
Dang your hide, Jumper!
Get out of there!

41
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:21,227
How many times do I gotta tell
you to quit eatin' the sweet corn?

42
00:04:23,213 --> 00:04:25,064
Now git!

43
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,461
Bit off more
than you could chew, huh?

44
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:47,853
What's for breakfast?

45
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,123
Bacon and mush. And milk,
after you finish the milkin'.

46
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:54,093
Bacon and mush.
Bacon and mush.

47
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,129
Every mornin' in the world
it's bacon and mush.

48
00:04:57,197 --> 00:04:59,114
Why don't you cook something
different once in a while...

49
00:04:59,182 --> 00:05:01,049
Than bacon and mush
like Mama does?

50
00:05:01,117 --> 00:05:03,118
'cause I'm not Mama,
that's why.

51
00:05:03,186 --> 00:05:05,987
Now you better
go milk that cow.

52
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:08,090
Milk the dang cow.
If you get an early start,

53
00:05:08,158 --> 00:05:11,160
Maybe we can finish scrubbing
that new patch of ground by night.

54
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:14,430
How much longer will Mama
and Papa be in San Antone?

55
00:05:14,497 --> 00:05:16,432
Oh, could be
a couple of weeks yet.

56
00:05:16,499 --> 00:05:18,434
Till Grandma dies?

57
00:05:18,501 --> 00:05:20,436
Now who said
she's gonna die?

58
00:05:20,503 --> 00:05:24,089
You know, Grandma won't
like it up there in Heaven.

59
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:27,459
There's nothing to do all day
but squat around on a cloud,

60
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:29,862
Trying to pick
one of them old guitars.

61
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:32,547
Harps, not guitars.

62
00:05:32,615 --> 00:05:35,150
Harps, guitars...
it's all the same difference.

63
00:05:35,218 --> 00:05:38,420
Grandma don't know
how to play neither one.

64
00:05:38,488 --> 00:05:41,323
Grandma's been sick before,
and she's got well.

65
00:05:41,391 --> 00:05:44,025
<i>Of course, maybe they'll
teach her how to play.</i>

66
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:47,128
I don't suppose them angels
has got much else to do.

67
00:05:47,196 --> 00:05:49,014
What's all this talk
about dying?

68
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:52,751
I was just thinking,
if Grandma dies,

69
00:05:52,818 --> 00:05:55,220
Mama's gonna be mighty sad.

70
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:58,023
It'll mean she'll have to
wait around until she dies...

71
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,526
Before she gets to
see Grandma again.

72
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:02,995
Then we'll all be
tore up 'cause we

73
00:06:02,996 --> 00:06:05,397
won't get to see Mama
again till we die.

74
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:07,732
I don't like it.

75
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,951
Well, don't worry about it
and maybe you'll live longer.

76
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:13,622
Me, I ain't never gonna die.
I'm gonna live forever.

77
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:17,342
Why don't you milk that cow so you
have something to live on? Now git.

78
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:21,546
Milk the cow.
Grub the brush.

79
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:24,015
Bacon and mush.

80
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:26,318
Arliss.
What?

81
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:30,689
You know, I was just thinkin'
we could use some fresh meat.

82
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:34,426
And if we get through with the
work in time, we might go huntin'.

83
00:06:34,493 --> 00:06:36,428
Huntin'?
You mean it?

84
00:06:36,495 --> 00:06:38,430
That's if we get through
with the work,

85
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:41,099
Which won't be likely
if you don't get to the milkin'.

86
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:43,427
I'll have that old
cow dry as a sunflower

87
00:06:43,428 --> 00:06:45,687
pod afore the
bacon's half fried.

88
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:56,248
old Dan Tucker
was a mighty man

89
00:06:56,316 --> 00:06:59,084
he washed his face
in a frying pan

90
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:01,620
combed his hair
with a wagon wheel

91
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:04,422
and he died of a toothache
on his heel

92
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,909
so get out the way
for old Dan Tucker

93
00:07:07,977 --> 00:07:10,361
get out the way
for old Dan Tucker

94
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:13,165
<i>get out the way
for old Dan Tucker</i>

95
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:16,501
he's too lazy
to come to supper

96
00:08:23,553 --> 00:08:25,620
Get him, Sam!

97
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,542
Fire right back, Sam!
Fire right back, boy!

98
00:08:36,365 --> 00:08:39,601
Out fancy her, boy!

99
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:44,073
Go on, in and out. She'll
never lay a horn to ya!

100
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:53,615
What on earth?

101
00:08:58,421 --> 00:09:00,522
<i>yee-haw!</i>

102
00:09:04,661 --> 00:09:07,212
Arliss, get that dog
outta here!

103
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:13,318
Dang you, Sam.
Now git!

104
00:09:13,385 --> 00:09:15,420
Travis,
you quit taking sides!

105
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:17,422
Go on!
Get outta here!

106
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:21,409
It's all right, Sam. You
had her beat. Get outta here!

107
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:25,213
I sent you out here to milk, not
start a stampede. I was milkin'.

108
00:09:25,281 --> 00:09:29,350
<i>easy, girl, easy.
Easy, girl. Easy, girl.</i>

109
00:09:29,418 --> 00:09:30,827
Actin' like a six
year old. I oughta

110
00:09:30,828 --> 00:09:32,237
cut me a sprout and
thrash your britches.

111
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:34,706
Guess you think you're
the boss, big as Papa, huh?

112
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:38,076
Well, Papa left me in charge and
said for you to do what I said!

113
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:41,012
Now go calm that cow down
and finish milkin'!

114
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:44,633
All right.

115
00:09:47,002 --> 00:09:49,204
Make me!

116
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:54,176
I'll bash you
with this bucket!

117
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:00,365
Wait till I get
my hands on you.

118
00:10:01,784 --> 00:10:04,052
Arliss!

119
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:08,106
Ow! Arliss!

120
00:10:09,492 --> 00:10:11,593
Ow! You quit chuckin' me,
you hear?

121
00:10:11,661 --> 00:10:13,528
I hear!

122
00:10:22,072 --> 00:10:24,706
Arliss, you quit that, or these
chickens won't lay for a month.

123
00:10:33,282 --> 00:10:36,851
<i>Sic him, Sam. Grab him!
-Arliss!</i>

124
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,242
I'll learn you
to boss me around.

125
00:10:46,028 --> 00:10:49,097
Stay with him, Sam!
Arliss! Sam, quit that.

126
00:10:54,704 --> 00:10:58,490
<i>you quit hittin' my dog!</i>

127
00:11:12,722 --> 00:11:15,390
When I get outta here, I'll
wear your tail end to a frazzle.

128
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:20,245
Arliss!
Uncle Beck!

129
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:22,247
Say, what's going on?

130
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:25,717
I could hear you hollering
on the next ridge.

131
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:29,020
Oh, what'd you got treed
there, a panther?

132
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:32,407
No, sir. Just Travis.

133
00:11:32,475 --> 00:11:36,578
Travis? You mean your
brother Travis? Yes, sir.

134
00:11:36,646 --> 00:11:38,880
Well, I'll be doggoned.
What you rockin' him for?

135
00:11:38,947 --> 00:11:41,649
Well, dang it, he's getting
too big for his britches!

136
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:43,735
He's always
bossing me around.

137
00:11:43,887 --> 00:11:47,923
Oh. Tellin' you what you can
do and what you can't, huh?

138
00:11:47,991 --> 00:11:51,126
Yes, sir. He never lets me
have a say about nothin'.

139
00:11:51,194 --> 00:11:53,779
and he works me
like a slave.

140
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:56,981
<i>Tsk, tsk, tsk. Well, I don't
blame you for rockin' him then.</i>

141
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,867
You don't?
No, sir.

142
00:11:58,935 --> 00:12:01,169
If it was me, I wouldn't
stand for it one minute.

143
00:12:01,237 --> 00:12:03,772
'cause I know what you're going
through, Arliss, 'cause your Papa...

144
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:07,175
Used to treat me exactly the
same way when I was little.

145
00:12:07,243 --> 00:12:10,045
Every minute of the day,
something like this,

146
00:12:10,112 --> 00:12:12,047
"Beck, you go chop
the wood.

147
00:12:12,114 --> 00:12:15,784
"Beck, go fetch the horses.
Beck, go slop the hogs.

148
00:12:15,852 --> 00:12:17,786
Beck, go milk the cow."

149
00:12:17,854 --> 00:12:22,640
That's why I wanted to kill
him a thousand times. Who, Papa?

150
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:25,743
You betcha. Anything
makes me killin' mad...

151
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:28,046
Is some great big, lazy,
overgrown boy...

152
00:12:28,113 --> 00:12:30,382
Workin' his poor little brother
half to death.

153
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:36,954
Let's get some brush. We'll set
fire to it and burn him out of there.

154
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:38,956
Burn him out?
Sure.

155
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:40,958
Like smokin' a possum
out of a hollow log.

156
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:43,712
You mean,
do that to Travis?

157
00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:46,881
Well, no,
that wouldn't do neither, no.

158
00:12:46,949 --> 00:12:51,285
Dang fire's liable to spread
and burn the whole place down.

159
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:53,988
Well, here you go.
Use this.

160
00:12:54,056 --> 00:12:56,124
Blast him outta there
with that.

161
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:59,093
Now, it'll make some holes in that
door you could pitch a dog through.

162
00:12:59,161 --> 00:13:01,095
But that's Travis
in there.

163
00:13:01,163 --> 00:13:04,032
I know that, Arliss.
That's what you been telling me.

164
00:13:04,099 --> 00:13:07,318
Now keep that arm steady,
boy. Steady.

165
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:10,505
see, now get
that front side down.

166
00:13:10,573 --> 00:13:13,708
Make her set right there
in the middle of that groove.

167
00:13:13,776 --> 00:13:16,461
Remember, you gotta squeeze
that trigger.

168
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:19,431
Aim a foot below the top of that
door, and you're gonna catch him...

169
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:21,766
Right smack between the eyes
on the first shot.

170
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:24,669
You crazy or something? You
think I wanna kill my own brother?

171
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:26,638
Well, Arliss, that's the
general idea I got from

172
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,540
the way you was whammin'
them rocks in there.

173
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:31,376
Well, I didn't aim
to kill him.

174
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:35,680
Oh. But you kill squirrels
with rocks, don't you?

175
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:41,102
And you killed that big
turkey gobbler with a rock.

176
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:43,104
Didn't you?

177
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:50,395
Now, I believe if it was me, I'd just
go wash the dirt out of that bucket...

178
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:52,597
And finish milkin' up
the cow.

179
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,366
Yes, sir.

180
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:57,736
Ah, ahem.

181
00:13:57,804 --> 00:14:01,590
I reckon she'll give you the milk
without you holdin' my gun on her.

182
00:14:01,657 --> 00:14:04,009
Huh?

183
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:06,811
Oh.

184
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:08,696
I reckon she will.

185
00:14:27,984 --> 00:14:30,051
I don't see how you do it,
Uncle Beck.

186
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:35,023
Now, any way I try to manage him, it's
like pokin' a stick in a hornet's nest.

187
00:14:35,091 --> 00:14:38,493
Well, that's generally the case
with being the older brother, Travis.

188
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:42,430
Maybe what you gotta do
is learn to out figure him.

189
00:14:43,699 --> 00:14:47,969
hey, smells like
something's afire.

190
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:51,522
It's the bacon!

191
00:15:14,697 --> 00:15:17,715
Dang that Arliss!

192
00:15:23,972 --> 00:15:25,773
Can't even milk a cow.

193
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:31,313
Hey, I picked... whee... I
picked this up in town for you.

194
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,815
A letter. Yep,
San Antone it says.

195
00:15:33,882 --> 00:15:35,951
It must be
from your Mama and Papa.

196
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:44,976
Mama says the doctor had
Grandma figured for a goner,

197
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:46,961
<i>But she fooled them.</i>

198
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,963
That don't surprise me none.

199
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,899
Crowd you to kill that little
ol' lady with a choppin' axe.

200
00:15:51,967 --> 00:15:53,901
That's about the way
Mama puts it.

201
00:15:53,969 --> 00:15:57,272
She says, "it will be a while
before Grandma is back on her feet.

202
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,974
But she's
just doing fine."

203
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,909
Well, I bet on it too.

204
00:16:04,012 --> 00:16:08,115
I never will forget that
little old lady back in Sedalia.

205
00:16:08,184 --> 00:16:10,251
When me and your Papa was
nothin' but tow-shirted kids,

206
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:13,888
We couldn't swipe a peach,
turpentine a cat,

207
00:16:13,955 --> 00:16:15,890
Ride the old milk calf,
nothin',

208
00:16:15,957 --> 00:16:19,427
Without Grandma Bailey swarmin'
all over us, three times a day.

209
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:23,781
Burnt the breakfast,
didn't you?

210
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:26,835
I got another batch started.

211
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:29,137
Mama never let
the breakfast get burnt.

212
00:16:29,205 --> 00:16:31,139
<i>Always had it
ready for me to eat,</i>

213
00:16:31,207 --> 00:16:33,241
The minute
I finished milkin'.

214
00:16:33,309 --> 00:16:35,594
Now, maybe your
Mama didn't have to

215
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:37,879
spend so much time
duckin' rocks neither.

216
00:16:37,946 --> 00:16:41,599
I best be movin' on. Oh,
you don't aim to eat with us?

217
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,468
No thanks.

218
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:45,470
I don't blame you...
bacon and mush.

219
00:16:45,538 --> 00:16:47,939
I ate early. I got to
hunt up a missing heifer.

220
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:51,276
Probably hold up in some thicket
with a new calf. New calf!

221
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,895
Golly, maybe I better
go help you hunt her.

222
00:16:53,962 --> 00:16:55,697
Now you better help
your brother finish the

223
00:16:55,698 --> 00:16:57,432
grubbin' because your
Papa wants to sow...

224
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,835
That new ground of winter
wheat, quick as he gets home.

225
00:17:00,903 --> 00:17:03,037
Aw, heck!

226
00:17:06,124 --> 00:17:08,543
You need any help,
you let me know, hear?

227
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:10,679
I'll be looking in on you
every now and then.

228
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:18,186
You remember what I said now.
You got to learn to outfigure him.

229
00:17:18,254 --> 00:17:20,855
Outfigure who?

230
00:17:20,923 --> 00:17:23,191
Outfigure who?
Oh...

231
00:17:23,259 --> 00:17:25,493
nobody.

232
00:17:25,561 --> 00:17:27,696
Nobody particular.

233
00:17:27,763 --> 00:17:31,633
Well, holler when the bacon's
fried. I'm near starved.

234
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,152
Where you going?

235
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,356
While you're cookin' up the grub,
I'll go harness up Old Jumper.

236
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:41,042
He can pack in the deer we
shoot when we go huntin'.

237
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:43,303
I said we might go when
we get the work done.

238
00:17:43,304 --> 00:17:45,496
There's plenty of
time to get Old Jumper.

239
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:48,666
I need him, anyhow,
to ride to work on.

240
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,702
Ride? That field
ain't a quarter mile off.

241
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:56,624
If you think I'm gonna do all that
walkin', then work too, you're crazy.

242
00:17:56,691 --> 00:17:59,377
Be too plumb wore out
to hit a lick.

243
00:17:59,444 --> 00:18:02,813
Now, confound it, Arliss, if
you're figurin' out some new...

244
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:05,049
figurin' out what?

245
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:10,789
Figurin' out some new way
to make work easier,

246
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:12,924
Why, that's fine.

247
00:18:12,992 --> 00:18:14,842
And takin' Old Jumper
to drag that brush,

248
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:17,445
I don't know why
I didn't think of that myself.

249
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:21,833
Well, come on, Arliss.
Go get 'em.

250
00:18:21,984 --> 00:18:24,585
All right.

251
00:18:24,653 --> 00:18:28,256
I'll bring along an extra rope
to clear away the brush with.

252
00:18:28,324 --> 00:18:31,492
Good idea. That's right
smart thinking, Arliss.

253
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:02,957
Atta boy, Sam.
Warm up that scent, boy.

254
00:19:03,025 --> 00:19:06,294
Sam's fixin' to pick up
a varmint trail.

255
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,947
<i>Go get him, boy!</i>

256
00:19:16,372 --> 00:19:18,322
nudge him out, boy.

257
00:19:23,111 --> 00:19:25,479
He's in there someplace.

258
00:19:25,547 --> 00:19:28,716
All right, Arliss,
she's tied.

259
00:19:28,783 --> 00:19:30,718
<i>Tote her down.</i>

260
00:19:30,786 --> 00:19:33,120
Stay with it, Sam.
You'll get him directly.

261
00:19:33,188 --> 00:19:35,606
All right, Jumper, giddap.

262
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:38,859
Come on, Jumper, giddap.

263
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,470
Whoa, Jumper!

264
00:19:51,673 --> 00:19:53,791
Whoa, Jumper!

265
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:58,012
Dang you, whoa!

266
00:20:00,198 --> 00:20:02,333
Arliss!

267
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,420
You and Jumper sure made
a mess out of that.

268
00:20:06,488 --> 00:20:09,156
What do you mean? He piled the
brush right where you wanted it.

269
00:20:12,394 --> 00:20:14,495
It sounds like
Sam struck a hot one.

270
00:20:14,563 --> 00:20:17,364
Yee-hoo!
Lookie yonder!

271
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:22,086
Yee-hoo! Go get him, Sam!

272
00:20:22,153 --> 00:20:25,523
Man, oh, man, ain't he makin'
that ol' cat get high behind?

273
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,391
One thing you can say
for old Sam, anytime

274
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,193
he takes to a trail,
he'll hang with it,

275
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:31,546
Better than any dog
I ever heard tell of.

276
00:20:31,614 --> 00:20:34,415
Come on, Travis. We'll mount up,
and we'll jump her and follow her.

277
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,283
We got work to do,
remember?

278
00:20:36,351 --> 00:20:39,320
But that ol' cat's been raiding the
chicken roost. We gotta catch him.

279
00:20:39,387 --> 00:20:42,790
Sure we do. And when Sam trees
him, we'll go right out and get him.

280
00:20:42,858 --> 00:20:45,893
But, meanwhile, we'll just
keep grubbing brush, right?

281
00:20:56,505 --> 00:21:00,975
Who ever heard tell of workin'
when you could chase a bobcat?

282
00:21:01,042 --> 00:21:03,244
Now, Arliss,
come on back here.

283
00:21:09,151 --> 00:21:12,353
I'll set your britches
to smokin', you hear me?

284
00:21:21,463 --> 00:21:23,932
Travis!

285
00:21:23,999 --> 00:21:27,635
<i>Travis Coates!
Mr. Searcy.</i>

286
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:38,062
Injuns! Injuns raiding
all over the place!

287
00:21:38,129 --> 00:21:41,449
Get your gun, boy. Get some bullets.
Break out a fresh keg of powder!

288
00:21:41,517 --> 00:21:43,867
Injuns?
Where, at salt licks?

289
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:46,387
Could be. By now, they're liable to
have wiped out the whole settlement.

290
00:21:46,454 --> 00:21:48,464
Burnin', killin'
scalpin'. Draggin' poor

291
00:21:48,465 --> 00:21:50,474
screamin' women off to
a fate worse than death.

292
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:52,627
Lisbeth, honey,
would you mind slippin' down?

293
00:21:52,694 --> 00:21:55,896
This poor old pony is gettin'
a mite winded. Yes, Papa.

294
00:21:55,964 --> 00:21:59,149
Well, who saw the Indians,
Mr. Searcy?

295
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:01,185
Well, I don't know.
Best I could learn...

296
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:03,787
Is they struck
at loyal valley last night.

297
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:08,593
Old Wiley crup, he come up with 16
head of horses missin' this mornin'.

298
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:12,396
What's that I smell
cookin', boy, frijole beans?

299
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:14,598
But, Mr. Searcy, missing horses
don't have to mean Indians.

300
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,734
Horses can stray.
Not them horses.

301
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:19,603
Crup says Injuns got 'em.
Told Todd McDougal they did.

302
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,605
But he didn't
set eyes on 'em.

303
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,674
Wiley said it sounded
like Injuns to him,

304
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,676
and you know Wiley
wouldn't tell a lie,

305
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:27,678
'less maybe there's
a little money involved.

306
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:30,347
them beans just about done,
ain't they, boy?

307
00:22:33,569 --> 00:22:35,870
What's that dog after,
Injuns?

308
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:37,872
No. Sam and Arliss
are trailin' a bobcat.

309
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:41,743
Thunder-ration, boy. Don't
you know no better than that?

310
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:43,553
Lettin' a helpless
youngun run footloose

311
00:22:43,554 --> 00:22:45,296
through them hills just
swarmin' with savages.

312
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:48,800
<i>Them red devils are liable to haul
off and scalp that boy any minute.</i>

313
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,802
Eat that dog too,
if you ain't watchin'.

314
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:53,737
<i>Injuns are partial
to dog eatin'.</i>

315
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:56,223
If I was you,
I'd go get him,

316
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:59,159
Before we even bother to set
a foot under that dinner table.

317
00:22:59,227 --> 00:23:01,829
Oh, well, it might not hurt
to go get him.

318
00:23:01,897 --> 00:23:04,398
Yeah, well, you just do that.
You just do that.

319
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:07,484
Lisbeth, honey, you might ought
to water this poor old pony.

320
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:09,486
Shuck him out
a few ears of corn too.

321
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:11,488
Build back his strength
a little. Yes, Papa.

322
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,490
And while you're out there
roundin' up the youngun,

323
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:16,727
I'll just be neighborly like and
go and look at them beans of yours.

324
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:19,596
Be a cryin' shame
if they was left to burn.

325
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:38,249
Tarnation,
them beans is hot!

326
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:51,495
You know, about them Indians, that's
mostly just scare talk, wasn't it?

327
00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:56,917
Well, you know Papa, always trying
to make things bigger than they are.

328
00:23:56,985 --> 00:24:02,390
Sometimes I wish he wouldn't,
well, you know, go on so much.

329
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:04,576
Oh, that ain't your
fault. Did you happen

330
00:24:04,577 --> 00:24:06,694
to hear just what
Tom McDougal did say?

331
00:24:06,762 --> 00:24:08,996
Well, now, yes.

332
00:24:09,063 --> 00:24:13,634
What he told Papa was that what Mr.
Crup said if it were ten years ago,

333
00:24:13,701 --> 00:24:16,637
He'd just bet it was Indians
who stole those horses.

334
00:24:16,704 --> 00:24:18,639
Yeah, that's about
what I figured.

335
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:21,175
It's been a long time
since Apaches come

336
00:24:21,176 --> 00:24:23,644
out of those high
mountains on a raid.

337
00:24:23,711 --> 00:24:25,646
Well.

338
00:24:27,615 --> 00:24:30,684
Still need to
round up Arliss, though.

339
00:24:30,752 --> 00:24:33,187
I'm gonna finish that grubbin'
before sundown.

340
00:24:37,743 --> 00:24:42,346
Um, would... would you care
for a mite of company?

341
00:24:43,699 --> 00:24:45,633
I ain't seen a bobcat
in some time.

342
00:24:45,701 --> 00:24:47,969
Close up, that is.

343
00:24:49,304 --> 00:24:52,507
Well, yeah, sure.
Sure.

344
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:12,276
Wouldn't hurt none
to hang on to my belt.

345
00:25:12,343 --> 00:25:14,511
Make more sense
than falling off.

346
00:25:37,152 --> 00:25:39,453
Did you hear about Betsy
Miller and George Floyd?

347
00:25:39,521 --> 00:25:42,890
No. What about 'em? Got
married last Thursday.

348
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:47,227
Got married? I didn't
know they was old enough.

349
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:50,865
Oh, yes. Betsy's eight
months older than me.

350
00:25:50,933 --> 00:25:54,669
And George, well, he's at least
a few months older than you.

351
00:25:54,736 --> 00:25:57,872
That's more than old enough.
Wouldn't you figure?

352
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,874
Yeah, sounds like.

353
00:25:59,942 --> 00:26:03,978
My Mama and Papa were even
younger when they got married.

354
00:26:04,046 --> 00:26:06,681
is that so?
Oh, yes.

355
00:26:06,748 --> 00:26:09,617
Mama says, "getting
married is the best way...

356
00:26:09,684 --> 00:26:12,353
For two folks to really
get to know each other."

357
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:15,489
listen.
I think I hear Sam.

358
00:26:15,557 --> 00:26:17,625
He's right over yonder.

359
00:26:30,238 --> 00:26:33,024
Well, I don't hear him now.
Me neither.

360
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:36,794
Be real quiet.
I wanna listen.

361
00:26:36,862 --> 00:26:39,964
that's Jumper.

362
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:50,324
There he is.

363
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:56,347
<i>go get him, Sam!</i>

364
00:27:03,505 --> 00:27:05,739
Arliss,
you come outta there.

365
00:27:05,807 --> 00:27:08,909
Not till we get
this old bobcat, I ain't.

366
00:27:12,614 --> 00:27:14,524
You leave that bobcat
alone. You keep messin'

367
00:27:14,525 --> 00:27:16,434
with him, he's liable
to eat you alive.

368
00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:18,786
He can't. I'm holdin'
him off with a stick.

369
00:27:18,854 --> 00:27:21,321
Listen to him squall
when I poke him.

370
00:27:28,547 --> 00:27:30,897
Pesky Arliss.
Tryin' to reason with him...

371
00:27:30,965 --> 00:27:35,402
<i>Is like buttin' your head up
against a stoop and pole stoke.</i>

372
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:37,404
I'd better go in
and get him.

373
00:27:46,932 --> 00:27:50,183
Sic him, Sam!
Just kill him!

374
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:53,070
That'll teach him
to leave our chickens alone.

375
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:55,106
Arliss,
you get outta there.

376
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:58,242
Travis, you leave go of me.
Not till I get you out of here.

377
00:27:58,309 --> 00:28:00,911
I ain't comin' out till
I'm darn good and ready.

378
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:03,214
Well, you get good and ready
'cause you're comin' out.

379
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:05,616
Oh, no, I ain't!

380
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:14,125
Ow!
You let go!

381
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:17,461
Quit kicking me!

382
00:28:26,405 --> 00:28:28,339
Dang you, Travis,
let go!

383
00:28:28,407 --> 00:28:30,541
Come on!

384
00:28:32,677 --> 00:28:34,478
Arliss.

385
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,813
I'll learn you,
Travis Coates.

386
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:39,367
Ow! Now cut it out!

387
00:28:39,434 --> 00:28:41,635
You stop rockin' Travis,
you hear?

388
00:28:41,703 --> 00:28:44,037
Ow!

389
00:28:44,105 --> 00:28:46,507
Hang on to him.

390
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:53,314
All right, Arliss. You asked
for it, and you're gonna get it.

391
00:28:53,382 --> 00:28:56,717
Dang you, Travis Coates, when I
get big, I'm gonna fix you good.

392
00:28:56,785 --> 00:28:59,620
<i>Hold it. Hold it!</i>

393
00:30:11,259 --> 00:30:13,493
We better make
a run for it.

394
00:30:21,937 --> 00:30:23,887
Travis!

395
00:30:43,224 --> 00:30:45,392
You leave my brother alone!

396
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,934
Get him, Sam!

397
00:31:38,045 --> 00:31:40,914
Chew on him, Sam.

398
00:31:46,955 --> 00:31:49,122
Murderer!

399
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,530
Uncle Beck!

400
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:02,322
Yah!

401
00:34:06,678 --> 00:34:09,946
Yah! Yah!

402
00:36:00,274 --> 00:36:02,208
Aah!

403
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:33,573
Travis!
It's all right.

404
00:36:33,641 --> 00:36:35,575
It's all right. They're
just having fun with him.

405
00:37:42,376 --> 00:37:45,228
Arliss, you gotta quit
fightin' 'em.

406
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:48,281
That little varmint bothers
me again and I'll kill him.

407
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:51,217
And get us all killed before we
get a chance to escape. Look out!

408
00:37:55,807 --> 00:37:59,543
You come back here with my hat,
you yellow-bellied coward!

409
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:02,746
Arliss, quit rilin' him. Next time
he'll be lifting more than your hat.

410
00:38:02,813 --> 00:38:05,482
So wild to get a scalp,
he'd even take it from a baby.

411
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:08,668
Who you callin' a baby?
-Arliss!

412
00:38:08,736 --> 00:38:11,404
You've got to quit fighting
back, do you hear me?

413
00:38:11,472 --> 00:38:14,207
Yeah, I hear.

414
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:08,361
That's the one
that killed Sam.

415
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:11,832
The one what stole
my hat. Killed Sam?

416
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:14,735
Chopped him down with a chunk of
wood while you were unconscious.

417
00:39:14,802 --> 00:39:16,803
I tell you,
he'll pay for that.

418
00:39:16,871 --> 00:39:19,014
Listen, don't start
anything. You're gonna

419
00:39:19,015 --> 00:39:21,158
mess up any chance we
got of gettin' away.

420
00:39:21,225 --> 00:39:24,061
All right,
but I'll get him.

421
00:39:26,881 --> 00:39:31,234
Travis, what's to happen to us
if we don't escape?

422
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:33,236
Don't fret, Lisbeth,
we'll get away.

423
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:35,689
But supposin' we don't,
what then?

424
00:39:35,757 --> 00:39:38,057
Well, it's kinda hard
to figure.

425
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:41,194
They'll probably make me into one
of their slaves, more than likely.

426
00:39:41,262 --> 00:39:44,731
Oh, no! Only reason I can figure
for them not killing me right off.

427
00:39:44,798 --> 00:39:47,534
Well, I ain't gonna be no
slave, and I'll swear to that.

428
00:39:47,602 --> 00:39:50,870
No, being a youngun, they'll
probably make you an Indian.

429
00:39:50,938 --> 00:39:53,473
I'd like to see 'em try.
I'd just like to see 'em.

430
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:57,961
You just simmer down. They ain't
gonna make no injun out of me.

431
00:39:58,029 --> 00:40:00,964
Travis?
Yes.

432
00:40:01,032 --> 00:40:03,300
What do you reckon
they figure to do with me?

433
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:09,339
I ain't really give that
proper thought.

434
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,875
They'll make me some
Indian's squaw, won't they?

435
00:40:11,942 --> 00:40:13,960
Lisbeth.
That one.

436
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:18,614
He's as much as claimed me,
hasn't he?

437
00:40:18,683 --> 00:40:21,417
Say, maybe that's
the way to do it.

438
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:24,470
Do what?
Get away.

439
00:40:24,538 --> 00:40:27,557
Let's get some other injun
and that one into a fight...

440
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:30,393
Over who gets Lisbeth
for his squaw.

441
00:40:30,461 --> 00:40:34,014
<i>And in the fuss, you and me
could make a run for it. Arliss!</i>

442
00:40:34,081 --> 00:40:36,141
Then we can hightail
it outta here and bring

443
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:38,201
back help. Maybe she
won't be married yet.

444
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,786
Travis!
Hush up!

445
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:42,471
If they're gonna make her a
squaw anyway, what's the harm?

446
00:40:42,539 --> 00:40:45,208
Arliss, be quiet!

447
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:49,479
Listen, Lisbeth. Nobody's
gonna touch you. I promise.

448
00:40:49,546 --> 00:40:53,016
But if you try to fight them,
they'll kill you.

449
00:40:53,084 --> 00:40:56,819
I'd rather be dead than see
one of them lay a hand on you.

450
00:41:00,408 --> 00:41:02,558
Mush.

451
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:23,963
That one your Uncle Beck shot, he's
different from the others, isn't he?

452
00:41:24,031 --> 00:41:28,535
Yeah, he's Comanche. You can tell
by his hair. Others are Apache.

453
00:41:28,602 --> 00:41:32,104
Why does he run instead
of ridin'? Is he crazy?

454
00:41:32,172 --> 00:41:34,307
No, it's easier to run.

455
00:41:34,375 --> 00:41:37,544
Jouncin' around that horse
hurts his wounded leg.

456
00:41:37,611 --> 00:41:41,581
Well, I hope that bullet
wound bleeds him to death.

457
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:59,199
Look at 'em,
stuffin' their bellies.

458
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:50,300
This meat tastes funny.

459
00:42:50,367 --> 00:42:52,502
Wonder what it is.

460
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,704
Horse meat,
more than likely.

461
00:42:56,673 --> 00:42:59,225
Horse meat?

462
00:42:59,293 --> 00:43:03,246
Where's Old Jumper?
Probably with the horses.

463
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,784
No, he ain't.
He ain't with the horses.

464
00:43:07,852 --> 00:43:10,720
Travis, they've killed him! They
went and butchered Old Jumper.

465
00:43:10,788 --> 00:43:14,524
Now how do you know?
-I can't see him nowheres.

466
00:43:14,591 --> 00:43:17,961
I can't eat none of Old
Jumper. I tell you, I can't.

467
00:43:18,029 --> 00:43:19,963
You don't know
it's Jumper.

468
00:43:20,031 --> 00:43:21,965
If it ain't him,
where's he at?

469
00:43:22,033 --> 00:43:24,067
Well, he could have
gotten away.

470
00:43:24,135 --> 00:43:26,937
I didn't see him get away. -You
didn't see him get butchered neither.

471
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:28,838
Now, Arliss, sit there
and eat 'cause you

472
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:30,673
don't know when you're
gonna get another chance.

473
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:33,509
But what if it is
Old Jumper?

474
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:37,780
If it is Old Jumper,
he won't mind.

475
00:43:37,849 --> 00:43:39,782
Jumper will know
you gotta eat.

476
00:43:39,851 --> 00:43:41,784
Sure.

477
00:44:04,008 --> 00:44:05,942
You know,

478
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:08,111
Jumper was a good ol' mule.

479
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:12,999
<i>Plowed our corn,
packed in our meat.</i>

480
00:44:14,468 --> 00:44:16,936
Hauled our crops.

481
00:44:17,004 --> 00:44:20,606
Drug up the logs
for the cabin, Papa said.

482
00:44:20,674 --> 00:44:23,777
And now he's keeping us
from starving to death.

483
00:44:36,623 --> 00:44:40,526
Do you remember the time the hogs
cut up you and Old Yeller so bad...

484
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:43,196
And Jumper had to
bring you in home?

485
00:44:46,733 --> 00:44:49,468
Arliss, could you just
hush up about Old Jumper?

486
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:55,608
Remember how we used to have
to tie a drag log to his foot...

487
00:44:55,676 --> 00:44:58,411
To keep him from jumpin'
into the corn?

488
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:02,682
Sure was a good old mule.

489
00:45:10,057 --> 00:45:12,725
Dang their
stinkin' hides.

490
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:16,162
Somebody's gonna pay
for killin' Old Jumper.

491
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:19,632
And I know just who.

492
00:45:31,345 --> 00:45:34,697
That oughta teach you something
about butcherin' Old Jumper.

493
00:46:15,188 --> 00:46:17,123
Put me down!

494
00:46:21,194 --> 00:46:23,296
Gimme back my shirt!

495
00:46:33,206 --> 00:46:35,157
What are they doing
to him?

496
00:46:35,225 --> 00:46:37,694
They admire his spirit. Gonna
make an Indian out of him.

497
00:47:34,818 --> 00:47:37,404
Lisbeth.

498
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:39,406
Lisbeth.

499
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:45,011
Get my knife
out of my back pocket.

500
00:47:51,752 --> 00:47:53,853
How will
I ever open it?

501
00:47:53,921 --> 00:47:56,423
Bring it up to my mouth.

502
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:14,874
Shh.

503
00:48:27,922 --> 00:48:30,423
Arliss.

504
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:32,475
Arliss!

505
00:48:32,543 --> 00:48:36,512
Shh. Be real quiet now.
I'm cutting you loose.

506
00:49:31,552 --> 00:49:33,486
Arliss,
you gone crazy?

507
00:49:33,554 --> 00:49:36,656
I wasn't leavin' without
my pants. Let's git.

508
00:49:44,965 --> 00:49:47,433
Travis, that's Sam.
Sam!

509
00:49:51,605 --> 00:49:53,273
Sam's alive!

510
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:55,808
Come on.
Look out!

511
00:50:08,455 --> 00:50:12,525
let me go!

512
00:50:20,033 --> 00:50:22,502
You leave him alone!

513
00:50:25,806 --> 00:50:27,807
No!

514
00:50:56,236 --> 00:50:58,704
no! No!

515
00:51:14,387 --> 00:51:17,489
Travis, that's Sam again!

516
00:51:17,558 --> 00:51:21,060
<i>Aah!
-He's on the trail.</i>

517
00:51:21,127 --> 00:51:23,930
Come on, Sam.
Bring Uncle Beck!

518
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:27,441
Troops, ho!

519
00:52:38,771 --> 00:52:41,289
Travis, look!

520
00:52:46,429 --> 00:52:49,897
Forward, ho!

521
00:53:18,961 --> 00:53:22,830
Wait! Wait!

522
00:54:05,074 --> 00:54:07,842
That's a really
scared bunch of Indians.

523
00:54:07,910 --> 00:54:10,412
Apaches from what
I could see through the dust.

524
00:54:10,479 --> 00:54:13,981
Yeah. Well, there's no use
chasing 'em any farther.

525
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:16,251
I wonder what devilry
they've been up to.

526
00:54:16,318 --> 00:54:18,719
Horse stealin'
it looks like.

527
00:54:18,787 --> 00:54:21,222
Left by twos. Ho.

528
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:39,790
Wait!

529
00:54:41,193 --> 00:54:44,462
Wait!

530
00:56:00,923 --> 00:56:02,857
Easy, boy.

531
00:56:04,292 --> 00:56:07,379
Whoa, now.

532
00:56:07,446 --> 00:56:09,797
I won't hurt you now.

533
00:56:11,166 --> 00:56:13,351
Whoa, now.

534
00:56:20,526 --> 00:56:23,895
Hold it now.
Hold it, boy.

535
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:25,797
Easy.

536
00:57:07,772 --> 00:57:09,707
Sam.

537
00:57:11,510 --> 00:57:14,445
Hey. What's
the matter, Sam?

538
00:57:14,513 --> 00:57:16,680
It's me, Travis.

539
00:57:16,748 --> 00:57:19,434
hey.

540
00:57:21,504 --> 00:57:23,421
Come here,
you old hound, you.

541
00:57:23,489 --> 00:57:25,957
Sure am glad
to see you, boy.

542
00:57:33,115 --> 00:57:35,850
Listen, Sam.

543
00:57:35,918 --> 00:57:39,387
If anything's gonna be done
for Lisbeth and Arliss,

544
00:57:39,455 --> 00:57:42,056
Looks like we gotta do it.

545
00:57:45,394 --> 00:57:48,496
Come on, boy.
Let's pick up that trail.

546
00:57:49,715 --> 00:57:52,217
Hey!
Sam, come here.

547
00:57:52,284 --> 00:57:54,919
Come here, Sam.
Come here.

548
00:57:54,986 --> 00:57:57,321
Sam, now listen.

549
00:57:57,389 --> 00:58:00,124
You gotta hold back
or you'll outrun me.

550
00:58:00,192 --> 00:58:03,795
We gotta work together on this
or we don't stand a chance.

551
00:58:05,764 --> 00:58:08,232
All right,
let's try again.

552
00:58:54,830 --> 00:58:57,665
Sam! Sam! Sam.

553
00:58:57,733 --> 00:59:01,201
Sam, wait.
Sam.

554
00:59:01,269 --> 00:59:03,121
Come back.

555
00:59:31,050 --> 00:59:32,750
Get him off of me!

556
00:59:32,818 --> 00:59:35,987
Travis! Travis.

557
00:59:36,055 --> 00:59:38,489
Quit that. Quit that, boy.

558
00:59:38,557 --> 00:59:40,658
Travis!
Take it easy now.

559
00:59:40,726 --> 00:59:42,760
Easy. Easy, Travis.
You settle down now.

560
00:59:42,828 --> 00:59:44,929
Take it easy.
Settle down now.

561
00:59:44,996 --> 00:59:47,031
Travis. Travis.

562
00:59:48,967 --> 00:59:51,252
Uncle Beck.

563
00:59:52,104 --> 00:59:54,455
Easy now.
Easy, Travis.

564
00:59:54,523 --> 00:59:56,524
We're with you now.

565
00:59:56,592 --> 01:00:00,344
Gosh doggone it. Tried...
tried to choke a man to death.

566
01:00:00,412 --> 01:00:02,880
well, get him
some water, crup.

567
01:00:02,948 --> 01:00:05,533
Lisbeth, my baby girl,
is she all right?

568
01:00:05,601 --> 01:00:08,235
What about Arliss?

569
01:00:08,303 --> 01:00:11,939
Back's bad sunburned.
Them bruises look ugly too.

570
01:00:12,007 --> 01:00:15,710
Best grease 'em. Todd, get that bacon
rind out of my saddlebag. Here, son.

571
01:00:15,777 --> 01:00:18,045
I have a clean shirt
in my saddlebag.

572
01:00:19,982 --> 01:00:23,383
Here. Easy. Easy now. -You kill
any of them cutthroat savages?

573
01:00:25,321 --> 01:00:27,588
<i>they still got my horses?</i>

574
01:00:27,656 --> 01:00:32,193
Them thievin' devils.
-Sam. We gotta get Sam!

575
01:00:32,261 --> 01:00:36,814
Sam? He got a hot
trail on them Indians.

576
01:00:36,882 --> 01:00:38,649
We gotta catch up
with that dog before

577
01:00:38,650 --> 01:00:40,417
it gets dark. You
think you can make it?

578
01:00:40,485 --> 01:00:41,944
He's gotta make it.
I tell you, them red

579
01:00:41,945 --> 01:00:43,404
devils so much as
touch my little girl...

580
01:00:43,472 --> 01:00:48,058
Of course I can make it. -Let's go
then. You can eat while we're riding.

581
01:00:48,126 --> 01:00:53,114
Now hold on a minute, Beck.
We got a little problem here.

582
01:00:53,182 --> 01:00:56,184
Seven men
and six horses.

583
01:00:56,251 --> 01:00:58,552
Ride double.

584
01:00:58,620 --> 01:01:02,673
Why, it's gonna be tough enough of
keepin' up with that dog ridin' single.

585
01:01:02,741 --> 01:01:06,544
And I say let's leave the boy here
and we'll pick him up on the way back.

586
01:01:06,612 --> 01:01:09,413
I'm goin'.
Now lookie here, boy.

587
01:01:09,481 --> 01:01:12,349
I won't hold nobody up.
I'll take it afoot. Afoot?

588
01:01:12,417 --> 01:01:16,788
Sure, I'll run alongside and hang onto
somebody's saddle, like the Comanche.

589
01:01:16,855 --> 01:01:19,924
Comanche? I thought
you said them was Apaches.

590
01:01:19,992 --> 01:01:22,102
They are Apache,
all but one. -Whoever

591
01:01:22,103 --> 01:01:24,212
heard of a Comanche
runnin' with Apache?

592
01:01:24,279 --> 01:01:26,997
What difference does it make? Our
job's to find 'em. Beck's right.

593
01:01:27,065 --> 01:01:30,218
Find 'em and kill 'em.

594
01:01:30,285 --> 01:01:32,770
You say that Comanche kept up
hanging on the saddle? Yes, sir.

595
01:01:32,837 --> 01:01:34,972
Well, if he can do it,
so can we.

596
01:01:35,039 --> 01:01:38,476
Get up on that horse and finish
eatin'. I'll take the first turn.

597
01:01:38,543 --> 01:01:40,578
If we don't catch up
with them before they get

598
01:01:40,579 --> 01:01:42,613
to the mountains we're
never gonna find 'em.

599
01:01:53,408 --> 01:01:56,844
Wiley, uh, I could use
a chaw myself.

600
01:02:01,183 --> 01:02:03,133
Come on.

601
01:02:37,586 --> 01:02:39,620
all right, who's next?

602
01:02:41,690 --> 01:02:45,359
<i>I believe I am, Beck.
no, you ain't.</i>

603
01:02:45,427 --> 01:02:49,947
Yeah, it's your turn. Bud Searcy
here's the only one that ain't run yet.

604
01:02:50,015 --> 01:02:51,949
Well, is that a fact?

605
01:02:52,017 --> 01:02:55,619
I reckon I lost count.
You mind totin' this for me?

606
01:03:00,692 --> 01:03:03,477
This old gun ain't
no good, Searcy. An

607
01:03:03,478 --> 01:03:06,263
old pony'd get swayback
just a packin' it.

608
01:03:06,331 --> 01:03:10,284
No good? Did I ever tell about the time
I blew a hole through two savages...

609
01:03:10,351 --> 01:03:13,120
Ridin' side by side
a thousand yards away?

610
01:03:13,187 --> 01:03:16,374
never did see two more
surprised Injuns, till today.

611
01:03:16,441 --> 01:03:19,126
Not to mention the buffalo
a-runnin' alongside 'em.

612
01:03:19,193 --> 01:03:22,113
Come on, bud.
-Beck, he's too old to run.

613
01:03:22,180 --> 01:03:26,116
Who's too old? Happen to know I'm
eight year younger than pack underwood.

614
01:03:26,184 --> 01:03:29,854
Yeah. Eight years younger
and a hundred pounds heavier.

615
01:03:29,921 --> 01:03:34,992
Why, 50 yards on foot and your eyeballs
would be a-stickin' out on their stems.

616
01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:38,362
Crup, if he wants to run,
let him run. Now let's git.

617
01:03:38,429 --> 01:03:42,116
Too old. Did I ever tell you about
the time I run a deer down on foot?

618
01:03:42,183 --> 01:03:45,235
Save your wind, Searcy.

619
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:04,288
Look at that.

620
01:04:06,341 --> 01:04:08,976
Could be Sam.

621
01:04:29,814 --> 01:04:33,834
<i>Uncle Beck, it's Sam! -All right,
hold it. Hold it. No shootin'.</i>

622
01:04:33,901 --> 01:04:36,870
Beat 'em off
with your ropes.

623
01:04:44,596 --> 01:04:46,764
Hyah! Hyah!

624
01:04:46,831 --> 01:04:50,067
Get out of here! Hyah!
Hyah! Get out of there!

625
01:04:50,135 --> 01:04:54,521
Hyah! Hyah! Go
on! Get up! Get up!

626
01:04:54,589 --> 01:04:57,558
Hyah! Hyah!
Go on! Get out of here!

627
01:04:57,626 --> 01:05:00,294
Get! Get up there!
Get up!

628
01:05:05,784 --> 01:05:09,053
Easy, boy.
Good old Sam.

629
01:05:09,121 --> 01:05:11,789
Let me see what
they did to you.

630
01:05:11,857 --> 01:05:14,458
Cut him up much?

631
01:05:14,525 --> 01:05:17,527
Well, they chewed up
his paw pretty bad. Oh.

632
01:05:17,595 --> 01:05:20,131
Think he can
take the trail?

633
01:05:21,733 --> 01:05:23,667
I don't know.

634
01:05:26,138 --> 01:05:28,438
Try him.

635
01:05:31,977 --> 01:05:35,512
All right, Sam.
Come here, boy.

636
01:05:38,549 --> 01:05:41,285
Come here, boy.
Come to me.

637
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:47,491
Come on, Sam.

638
01:05:53,498 --> 01:05:55,549
What are we gonna
do now, Beck?

639
01:05:55,617 --> 01:05:57,885
I say leave him here
and let's get to ridin'.

640
01:05:57,953 --> 01:06:01,488
The trail's gonna be tougher to follow
from here on, especially at night.

641
01:06:01,556 --> 01:06:03,991
Without that dog
we ain't got a prayer.

642
01:06:05,326 --> 01:06:08,029
But that hound
can't even walk.

643
01:06:08,096 --> 01:06:10,264
Hand him up here, Travis.

644
01:06:10,331 --> 01:06:13,483
Wiley crup, you done
that on purpose.

645
01:06:13,551 --> 01:06:16,754
Ah, quit your "bellerin'." Searcy,
a good bath never hurt you none.

646
01:06:24,629 --> 01:06:27,298
Man, now I guess
I seen everything.

647
01:06:27,366 --> 01:06:32,203
Blowhards and pot hounds allowed to
ride while good men are left afoot.

648
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:38,826
All right, who runs now?
-Reckon I do.

649
01:06:40,678 --> 01:06:43,447
You reckon you can?
-Sure.

650
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:49,170
Let's git.

651
01:07:20,485 --> 01:07:23,087
Travis.
Yes, sir?

652
01:07:24,722 --> 01:07:27,858
Take Sam down and see
if he can pick up the trail.

653
01:07:28,994 --> 01:07:32,662
Supposin' he can't?
He will.

654
01:07:47,112 --> 01:07:49,113
Go, Sam.

655
01:08:08,716 --> 01:08:10,650
Please, Sam.

656
01:08:12,453 --> 01:08:14,722
Arliss, Sam.

657
01:08:14,789 --> 01:08:16,807
Go find Arliss.

658
01:08:23,348 --> 01:08:25,916
Come on, Sam.

659
01:08:38,046 --> 01:08:41,014
That's it, Sam!
-Stick with it, Sam.

660
01:08:42,901 --> 01:08:45,252
Travis, go on,
pick him up.

661
01:08:46,821 --> 01:08:48,856
We're on the right trail.

662
01:08:48,924 --> 01:08:52,225
What'd I tell ya?

663
01:08:52,293 --> 01:08:56,931
still say we're puttin' a heap
of Faith in a lame dog.

664
01:08:56,998 --> 01:08:59,600
Right now a lame dog's
all we got.

665
01:09:08,910 --> 01:09:11,645
Don't tell me
about right and wrong.

666
01:09:11,713 --> 01:09:14,098
I'm not trying to
tell you anything, pack.

667
01:09:14,166 --> 01:09:16,366
Then don't argue with me
about injun killing.

668
01:09:16,434 --> 01:09:19,352
I wasn't arguing. I merely said the
reason the Indians fight so hard...

669
01:09:19,421 --> 01:09:22,389
Is the white man's crowding
in, killing off the buffalo.

670
01:09:22,457 --> 01:09:26,259
That's all. Them Injuns don't own
the land, they don't own the buffalo.

671
01:09:26,327 --> 01:09:28,462
Maybe not, but after
thousands of years

672
01:09:28,463 --> 01:09:30,597
they feel as though
they have a right to it.

673
01:09:30,665 --> 01:09:33,066
They're gonna learn different.

674
01:09:33,135 --> 01:09:35,736
And I learn 'em.

675
01:09:37,906 --> 01:09:40,908
Sometimes hard to tell
who the savages are.

676
01:09:40,976 --> 01:09:43,010
Dirty injun lover!

677
01:09:46,598 --> 01:09:49,316
Quit that!
Quit it out, I said!

678
01:09:49,383 --> 01:09:51,652
Quit that! He can't
talk to me that way!

679
01:09:51,719 --> 01:09:54,054
I said, quit it. We
go fightin' amongst

680
01:09:54,055 --> 01:09:56,389
ourselves, we're never
gonna catch no Injuns.

681
01:10:03,097 --> 01:10:06,450
Travis, you spell
crup a while.

682
01:10:06,517 --> 01:10:10,821
It's about time. My feets wore
off clean up to the hipbone.

683
01:10:14,759 --> 01:10:17,127
I didn't mean
to get him so upset.

684
01:10:18,630 --> 01:10:20,964
I know that.

685
01:10:21,032 --> 01:10:23,783
I never saw a man
so full of hate.

686
01:10:23,851 --> 01:10:27,370
Well, there's things that can
sometimes breed hate in a man.

687
01:10:27,438 --> 01:10:29,540
Not like that.

688
01:10:31,109 --> 01:10:33,376
You're new out here, white.

689
01:10:33,444 --> 01:10:36,780
You're gonna find
this is a hard country.

690
01:10:36,848 --> 01:10:41,785
You go to fightin' it, and it fights
you right back every inch of the way.

691
01:10:41,853 --> 01:10:44,405
Ain't Virginia.
I realize that, Beck.

692
01:10:45,490 --> 01:10:47,424
I mean, out here...

693
01:10:47,492 --> 01:10:50,761
A man puts in
a crop of corn and...

694
01:10:50,829 --> 01:10:53,730
You bust your back
watering it and hoeing it,

695
01:10:53,798 --> 01:10:56,901
And just before harvest
it gets set on by hoppers.

696
01:10:56,968 --> 01:10:59,302
They hate the land.

697
01:10:59,370 --> 01:11:02,405
And you got about 50 head
of cattle ready for market.

698
01:11:02,474 --> 01:11:04,875
Then blight comes
along and kills 'em

699
01:11:04,876 --> 01:11:07,277
all off. You get so
you hate everythin'.

700
01:11:07,345 --> 01:11:09,612
But not other people
the way he does.

701
01:11:12,333 --> 01:11:15,702
Look, a couple of years ago,
pack come home...

702
01:11:15,770 --> 01:11:19,172
He come one day and he found
his cabin burnt to the ground...

703
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:21,108
And his wife
and three kids was killed.

704
01:11:21,176 --> 01:11:23,844
All of 'em was scalped.

705
01:11:24,562 --> 01:11:27,648
And he about went crazy
grievin'.

706
01:11:27,716 --> 01:11:30,016
That can turn into hate
real easy.

707
01:11:34,305 --> 01:11:36,506
Come on, Sam.

708
01:11:36,574 --> 01:11:38,575
That's a boy.

709
01:11:41,212 --> 01:11:45,282
I just thought you
ought to know. Come on.

710
01:11:45,349 --> 01:11:47,751
all right, let's go.

711
01:12:25,473 --> 01:12:27,841
Look it.

712
01:12:27,908 --> 01:12:31,028
They buried that fire and let out
in a hurry. -How long do you figure?

713
01:12:31,096 --> 01:12:33,463
It couldn't be long.
The sand's still warm.

714
01:12:33,531 --> 01:12:36,817
If we're that close behind them red
devils, now's the time to crowd in.

715
01:12:36,884 --> 01:12:39,686
That's what we're gonna do.
Travis, go get Sam.

716
01:12:39,753 --> 01:12:41,705
Come here, Sam.

717
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:47,227
<i>Whose turn is it to run?
-It's mine, Beck.</i>

718
01:13:02,677 --> 01:13:07,013
Notice how many snakes and
spiders are movin' about? Yeah.

719
01:13:07,081 --> 01:13:08,898
Come on. Let's go.

720
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:34,925
If it wasn't the
middle of the day, I'd

721
01:13:34,926 --> 01:13:37,210
say those birds are
heading for their roost.

722
01:13:37,278 --> 01:13:39,345
They are.
It's fixin' to rain.

723
01:13:40,648 --> 01:13:44,250
Are you sure?
Look it there.

724
01:13:44,318 --> 01:13:47,921
Any time you see one of them
old boys on the prowl...

725
01:13:47,988 --> 01:13:51,124
This far from water,
you can bet it's gonna rain.

726
01:13:51,192 --> 01:13:55,562
Well, if it rains,
what happens to the trail?

727
01:13:55,630 --> 01:13:57,898
We'll worry about that
when it rains.

728
01:15:01,062 --> 01:15:03,846
That's hail!
Crop 'em up behind Todd.

729
01:15:05,533 --> 01:15:07,684
Head for them rocks!

730
01:15:29,140 --> 01:15:31,441
Head for that cave!

731
01:15:54,515 --> 01:15:58,251
This ain't the safest place in the
world, but it's better than nothin'.

732
01:15:58,319 --> 01:16:01,021
Not much. If a ten-foot
head of water come

733
01:16:01,022 --> 01:16:03,723
a boilin' down out
of them hills yonder,

734
01:16:03,791 --> 01:16:05,859
It'll drown every
last one of us afore

735
01:16:05,860 --> 01:16:07,927
we get a chance to
turn around and spit.

736
01:16:07,996 --> 01:16:12,299
Wiley, if you knows of a better
place, why don't you go crawl into it?

737
01:16:54,808 --> 01:16:57,344
We ain't through yet,
Travis.

738
01:16:57,412 --> 01:17:00,246
How could Lisbeth and
Arliss live through all this?

739
01:17:00,314 --> 01:17:04,851
Ah, them Indians can find shelter, you
can bet on that. That's right, Travis.

740
01:17:04,919 --> 01:17:07,654
They're a lot wilder, know
more about the country than us.

741
01:17:07,722 --> 01:17:11,090
Sure. But the trail will
be completely wiped out.

742
01:17:11,158 --> 01:17:13,626
We know they're
headed right for them

743
01:17:13,627 --> 01:17:16,095
mountains, and Sam can
pick up the trail again.

744
01:17:16,163 --> 01:17:18,214
Man alive, Coates.
Pickin' up a trail

745
01:17:18,215 --> 01:17:20,266
after a Storm like
that might take days.

746
01:17:20,334 --> 01:17:22,944
I'll worry about that,
crup. -How long you

747
01:17:22,945 --> 01:17:25,555
figure these old wore-out
horses gonna last?

748
01:17:25,623 --> 01:17:28,408
Till they go down.
Then what?

749
01:17:28,476 --> 01:17:30,944
Then we're gonna
take out afoot.

750
01:17:31,011 --> 01:17:33,380
Afoot?
-That's what I said.

751
01:17:33,448 --> 01:17:35,915
Well, if that's your plan
you can count me out.

752
01:17:40,371 --> 01:17:42,772
Figure on goin' home,
you can walk.

753
01:17:44,458 --> 01:17:48,661
Try and take my horse? -I
wouldn't try it. I'd just take it.

754
01:17:48,729 --> 01:17:52,032
Coates,

755
01:17:52,099 --> 01:17:54,734
I rode in here
on my horse.

756
01:17:54,802 --> 01:17:58,271
I aim to ride out on him
anytime I please.

757
01:17:59,340 --> 01:18:02,008
So don't nobody
try and stop me.

758
01:18:03,244 --> 01:18:06,379
Wiley, you damn move
a hair...

759
01:18:06,447 --> 01:18:09,715
And I'll be obliged to blow a
hole clean through your backbone.

760
01:18:09,783 --> 01:18:12,302
And this close
that ain't no brag.

761
01:18:17,508 --> 01:18:19,509
You ain't got the gall.

762
01:18:19,576 --> 01:18:24,014
Gentlemen, would you kindly
step out from behind Mr. Crup?

763
01:18:26,150 --> 01:18:28,851
Thank you, gentlemen.

764
01:18:28,919 --> 01:18:32,655
Now, Wiley, would you care
to test my gall?

765
01:18:40,915 --> 01:18:42,983
That's better.

766
01:18:46,821 --> 01:18:50,090
It stopped!
-Well, let's get movin'.

767
01:18:50,158 --> 01:18:52,625
What are we gonna do
about crup? Nothin'.

768
01:18:52,693 --> 01:18:56,763
Aren't we gonna take his guns? He
can't fight Indians without a gun.

769
01:18:58,833 --> 01:19:01,434
You old jackass, you.

770
01:19:09,961 --> 01:19:12,562
Wiley, I could use a chaw.

771
01:19:14,799 --> 01:19:18,001
Wiley, I'm askin' you
to do me a favor.

772
01:19:18,069 --> 01:19:21,004
I want you to loan me
a chaw of tobacco.

773
01:19:23,641 --> 01:19:26,109
thanks.

774
01:20:23,517 --> 01:20:26,102
Uncle Beck,
wait!

775
01:20:26,169 --> 01:20:29,789
go get 'em, Sam.
Hunt it out, boy.

776
01:20:29,857 --> 01:20:32,859
<i>It's all up to you now.</i>

777
01:20:32,927 --> 01:20:34,978
Do you think he's got
it? -I know he's got it.

778
01:20:34,979 --> 01:20:37,030
Stay with it, boy.
Stay with it.

779
01:20:37,098 --> 01:20:39,499
<i>come on in. He's got it!</i>

780
01:20:59,119 --> 01:21:01,087
Uncle Beck.

781
01:21:04,324 --> 01:21:06,626
Uncle Beck,
we're gettin' close.

782
01:21:06,693 --> 01:21:09,495
You sure? Yes,
sir. I'm real sure.

783
01:21:09,563 --> 01:21:12,782
<i>Sam. Sam.
Here, boy. Sam!</i>

784
01:21:12,850 --> 01:21:16,235
He's liable to run right into
them Injuns. Y'all wait here.

785
01:21:17,672 --> 01:21:20,490
Wait? I came to kill Injuns,
not to wait.

786
01:21:20,558 --> 01:21:24,828
Beck said to wait.
Now I reckon we best do it.

787
01:21:27,782 --> 01:21:29,565
Sam!

788
01:21:41,846 --> 01:21:44,664
Here, Sam. Sam.
Come here.

789
01:21:44,731 --> 01:21:48,234
Come here, Sam. Come here,
you. Hold it. Hold it.

790
01:21:48,302 --> 01:21:51,371
Now quit that.
Quit it, Sam.

791
01:21:51,438 --> 01:21:54,357
You bite me, I'm gonna
bite you right back, you fool.

792
01:21:54,425 --> 01:21:57,711
okay.

793
01:21:57,778 --> 01:21:59,946
You get your mind set
on one thing, you're

794
01:21:59,947 --> 01:22:02,115
stubborn as a one-eyed
mule, ain't ya?

795
01:22:02,182 --> 01:22:06,620
All right. Let's see what's
on the other side of that hill.

796
01:23:04,961 --> 01:23:06,662
Travis.

797
01:23:08,765 --> 01:23:11,701
You'll be needin'
some extra cartridges.

798
01:23:13,871 --> 01:23:15,805
Thank you.

799
01:23:23,848 --> 01:23:26,433
Did you see 'em? In the
draw, back of that hill.

800
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:29,835
Well, let's go. Now
wait. Now just wait!

801
01:23:32,723 --> 01:23:34,740
You wait and listen.

802
01:23:38,679 --> 01:23:40,946
They're fixin' to split up.

803
01:23:41,014 --> 01:23:44,734
The only chance we got is to keep
'em from gettin' to their horses.

804
01:23:44,802 --> 01:23:48,555
So I'm gonna ride in and
try and stampede their herd.

805
01:23:48,623 --> 01:23:52,008
Y'all cover me.
Ya understand? Travis.

806
01:23:52,076 --> 01:23:56,212
You take Sam and tie him up. Put a
muzzle on him so he can't give us away.

807
01:23:56,280 --> 01:23:58,665
Yes, sir.

808
01:23:58,732 --> 01:24:02,485
White, you and Todd
circle that ridge.

809
01:24:02,552 --> 01:24:04,971
<i>Come up behind 'em.</i>

810
01:24:05,038 --> 01:24:06,681
Now, I'm countin'
on the two of you to

811
01:24:06,682 --> 01:24:08,324
keep 'em from gettin'
up to them mountains.

812
01:24:08,392 --> 01:24:10,710
Hold your fire until
you see me come into

813
01:24:10,711 --> 01:24:13,029
that valley because
we got to surprise 'em.

814
01:24:13,096 --> 01:24:18,251
Crup, you and bud take cover
down at the mouth of that draw.

815
01:24:18,318 --> 01:24:20,986
That way you can keep 'em from gettin'
out into the open country again.

816
01:24:21,054 --> 01:24:24,023
Once the shootin' starts, we'll
catch 'em in a cross fire. Now, go on.

817
01:24:24,090 --> 01:24:26,025
Come on, Bud.
Let's go.

818
01:24:26,092 --> 01:24:28,494
And where do I go?

819
01:24:29,646 --> 01:24:31,580
You stick with me, pack.

820
01:24:35,335 --> 01:24:37,270
Get up here.

821
01:24:44,678 --> 01:24:46,779
Boy, Sam sure hates
bein' left out.

822
01:24:50,083 --> 01:24:52,168
Well, he done his part.

823
01:24:52,236 --> 01:24:56,105
The rest of it's
up to us now. Come on.

824
01:25:12,890 --> 01:25:15,324
We'll belly crawl from here.

825
01:25:22,015 --> 01:25:26,919
Now, look, Travis. When this
thing opens up, it's gonna go fast.

826
01:25:26,987 --> 01:25:31,574
So you gotta be ready for anything and
everything. Ya understand? Yes, sir.

827
01:25:31,641 --> 01:25:36,195
Now, remember one thing. We're out
here to get Arliss and Lisbeth back.

828
01:25:36,263 --> 01:25:39,732
If we got to kill some Indians to
do it, that's the way it's gonna be.

829
01:25:44,338 --> 01:25:50,043
Now, when you go into a fight, there
ain't but one thing you can bet on.

830
01:25:50,111 --> 01:25:53,145
That's you're gonna be scared.

831
01:25:53,214 --> 01:25:55,448
You feel that way too?

832
01:25:57,067 --> 01:26:00,269
Man and boy,
it's all the same.

833
01:26:44,180 --> 01:26:46,733
They're fightin'
over Lisbeth.

834
01:26:55,909 --> 01:26:59,762
Dirty red savages. Hold
it. Hold, hold it, pack.

835
01:26:59,830 --> 01:27:02,231
Let 'em get good and caught up
in their fightin'.

836
01:27:02,298 --> 01:27:04,767
It'll give me a better chance
to stampede their horses.

837
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:25,004
Stick 'im!
Stick 'im!

838
01:27:41,855 --> 01:27:44,123
There's my little girl.

839
01:27:44,191 --> 01:27:47,993
Hold it! Hold it! You heard what
Beck said. What you waitin' for?

840
01:27:57,720 --> 01:28:01,424
I'm gonna ride in now.
Y'all give me cover.

841
01:28:08,465 --> 01:28:11,400
You dirty,
murderin' savages.

842
01:28:13,070 --> 01:28:15,671
You dirty, murderin'
savages! No!

843
01:28:50,824 --> 01:28:53,009
Travis!

844
01:29:45,012 --> 01:29:47,279
Look out!

845
01:29:58,208 --> 01:30:01,510
Hyah!

846
01:30:28,855 --> 01:30:30,790
Uncle Beck!

847
01:30:46,123 --> 01:30:49,241
I got him, Uncle Beck!
I got him!

848
01:31:12,282 --> 01:31:16,118
You yellow-bellied varmint,
I'll fix you!

849
01:31:18,021 --> 01:31:21,690
Who's gonna help you now,
you skinny little Apache?

850
01:31:32,018 --> 01:31:34,219
Get him, Sam!

851
01:31:41,811 --> 01:31:44,913
Lisbeth!
-Papa!

852
01:31:49,636 --> 01:31:53,372
Shoot him.
Shoot him.

853
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:55,908
Shoot him.
Shoot him!

854
01:32:23,470 --> 01:32:26,472
He's out of our range, but
that old cannon might reach him.

855
01:32:26,539 --> 01:32:28,891
Give me it!
Let go.

856
01:32:28,958 --> 01:32:30,993
Give me it!
Let go!

857
01:32:40,203 --> 01:32:43,622
Shoot. Shoot.

858
01:32:50,747 --> 01:32:54,350
Ya did it. Ya did it!

859
01:32:54,417 --> 01:32:57,085
Man alive, what a shot!

860
01:32:59,272 --> 01:33:02,991
Yeah. We'll never hear
the end of this.

861
01:33:21,711 --> 01:33:23,645
Oh, Travis!

862
01:34:11,978 --> 01:34:14,897
Chase him clean
out of Texas, Sam!

863
01:34:24,507 --> 01:34:27,476
Arliss!
Uncle Beck!

864
01:34:27,543 --> 01:34:29,578
Sam!

865
01:34:29,645 --> 01:34:31,463
Here, Sam!

866
01:34:33,266 --> 01:34:35,200
Come on, boy.

867
01:34:42,275 --> 01:34:45,944
Did you see us fightin', me
and that old injun? I sure did.

868
01:34:46,012 --> 01:34:47,996
Boy, we done that injun
under, didn't we?

869
01:34:48,064 --> 01:34:50,799
Well, you had a lot
of practice on your brother.

870
01:34:50,867 --> 01:34:53,619
We sure cleaned
his plows good.

871
01:34:55,655 --> 01:34:57,540
All the time I was
worryin' about you, I

872
01:34:57,541 --> 01:34:59,425
should've been worryin'
about them Injuns.

873
01:34:59,492 --> 01:35:02,228
Come on up here.

874
01:35:07,401 --> 01:35:09,335
Come on, Sam.

875
01:35:15,709 --> 01:35:17,759
Papa?

876
01:35:17,827 --> 01:35:21,230
Papa, please open up
your eyes. G. Searcy?

877
01:35:23,149 --> 01:35:26,819
<i>What's the matter with Bud?
-Mr. Crup, the water, please.</i>

878
01:35:26,887 --> 01:35:30,322
It's a-comin'.
It's a-comin'.

879
01:35:33,426 --> 01:35:37,012
What's wrong with him?
Dead, most likely.

880
01:35:37,079 --> 01:35:39,031
Arliss.
Papa, please wake up.

881
01:35:39,098 --> 01:35:43,869
His pulse seems all right. -Ah,
they ain't nothin' wrong with him.

882
01:35:44,888 --> 01:35:47,523
Mr. Crup!
What happened?

883
01:35:47,591 --> 01:35:52,360
You made that brag shot, and then
you keeled over, you old fake.

884
01:35:52,428 --> 01:35:54,947
From hunger.

885
01:35:55,015 --> 01:35:58,817
Weren't nice of you pourin'
that water on me, crup.

886
01:35:58,885 --> 01:36:03,288
Boy, you'll never live this
down. Two baths in one year.

887
01:36:03,356 --> 01:36:06,041
Papa, are you all right?

888
01:36:06,109 --> 01:36:08,911
A mite feverish.
Tell you what, honey.

889
01:36:08,979 --> 01:36:13,649
Why don't you start up a fire and
cook your Papa up some hot grub?

890
01:36:13,716 --> 01:36:15,401
Bud, we ain't got
time for that. We gotta

891
01:36:15,402 --> 01:36:17,086
round up them horses
and get on home.

892
01:36:17,154 --> 01:36:18,887
come on, Sam.

893
01:36:21,458 --> 01:36:25,411
What about the rest of them hostiles
out there playin' dead in the grass?

894
01:36:25,478 --> 01:36:28,514
Pack, we got Arliss and Lisbeth.
That's all we come out here for.

895
01:36:28,582 --> 01:36:31,883
I ain't leavin' till I make sure
every one of them savages is dead.

896
01:36:31,951 --> 01:36:34,837
Well, you're gonna have to
kill 'em all by yourself,

897
01:36:34,905 --> 01:36:37,072
'cause the rest of us
goin' home.

898
01:36:58,545 --> 01:37:02,814
Anytime you feel strong enough to
ride by yourself, you just say so.

899
01:37:02,882 --> 01:37:07,286
Oh, yes, Travis. Just as soon as I
feel strong enough, I'll let you know.

900
01:37:10,857 --> 01:37:14,243
Crup, did you see how
steady-handed I was...

901
01:37:14,310 --> 01:37:16,278
When I lifted
my trusty old 55 and...

902
01:37:16,346 --> 01:37:20,549
Bud, I seen how lucky you was, and
I don't wanna hear no more about it.

903
01:37:22,318 --> 01:37:24,253
Mr. White.

904
01:37:27,808 --> 01:37:30,042
Mr. White, I bet down
in Virginia,

905
01:37:30,109 --> 01:37:32,812
You never did see a shot like
the one I put through that injun.

906
01:37:32,879 --> 01:37:36,615
'course it weren't nothin'
unusual. There were a time once I...

907
01:37:36,683 --> 01:37:39,952
Excuse me, Mr. Searcy.
I believe Beck needs me.

908
01:37:49,295 --> 01:37:52,764
Hello, little Arliss.
Well, hi, Mr. Searcy.

909
01:37:52,832 --> 01:37:57,102
Well, boy, I guess you must be
powerful grateful to me.

910
01:37:57,169 --> 01:38:01,273
I run halfway across Texas on foot
just to save you and my little girl.

911
01:38:01,340 --> 01:38:05,945
Oh. G. Searcy, did you see me and
old Sam when we took on that injun?

912
01:38:06,012 --> 01:38:09,414
No, I didn't. But I don't reckon you
was watchin' when I made that shot?

913
01:38:09,482 --> 01:38:12,284
Well, no, I wasn't.
But let me tell you.

914
01:38:12,352 --> 01:38:16,288
I busted him with some rocks,
and then Sam, he nailed him good.

915
01:38:16,356 --> 01:38:18,924
And afore we got through
with that poor old injun,

916
01:38:18,992 --> 01:38:22,478
I'll bet he wishes he never even
thought of runnin' off with me.

917
01:38:22,545 --> 01:38:26,948
Now look, Arliss. It don't seem
proper for a boy to brag on hisself.

918
01:38:27,016 --> 01:38:29,184
Why, this ain't no brag,
Mr. Searcy.

919
01:38:29,252 --> 01:38:32,488
Every word I'm about to
tell you is the gospel truth.

920
01:38:32,555 --> 01:38:36,525
You see, the day we was caught,
Travis and Lisbeth was scared,

921
01:38:36,593 --> 01:38:38,510
And Sam, he was hurt.

922
01:38:38,578 --> 01:38:42,080
So I had to start out fightin'
them Injuns all by myself.

923
01:38:42,148 --> 01:38:46,768
There was one injun took a particular
dislikin' to me right from the start,

924
01:38:46,836 --> 01:38:49,671
So I knew I had to
fix him proper.

925
01:38:49,739 --> 01:38:53,242
See, I had this little plan
right up here in my head,

926
01:38:53,309 --> 01:38:55,544
And one day
when he wasn't lookin',

927
01:38:55,612 --> 01:38:59,147
Why, I got me a club and I
busted it right over his head.

928
01:38:59,215 --> 01:39:01,583
Then dang them, they
threw me right in a

929
01:39:01,584 --> 01:39:03,952
pond, but I fought
'em off just the same.

930
01:39:04,020 --> 01:39:07,289
You know, I never will forget the
day they killed and ate Old Jumper.

931
01:39:07,357 --> 01:39:09,492
I picked me up a tree
branch and clubbed the

932
01:39:09,493 --> 01:39:11,627
injun right over the
head and laid him low.

933
01:39:11,695 --> 01:39:14,797
Then danged if I didn't have to
fight off half a dozen of 'em.

934
01:39:14,864 --> 01:39:17,465
I'd have licked 'em too
if one of them hadn't...

935
01:39:17,533 --> 01:39:19,851
Sure you don't wanna come
to the ranch and get some grub?

936
01:39:19,919 --> 01:39:23,588
Nope, I'll just be helpin' crup
drive those horses back to his place.

937
01:39:23,656 --> 01:39:27,559
Then I'll be for wantin'
to get back home. I reckon.

938
01:39:28,828 --> 01:39:32,797
Well, uh, you tell the rest
of 'em I'm beholden.

939
01:39:32,865 --> 01:39:35,484
It was just somethin'
that had to be done.

940
01:39:56,039 --> 01:39:58,474
It was then and there
they decided to make

941
01:39:58,475 --> 01:40:00,909
an injun out of me,
'cause of my bravery.

942
01:40:00,977 --> 01:40:05,080
And I'll tell you somethin' else, Mr.
Searcy... I can't wait to hear it, boy.

943
01:40:05,148 --> 01:40:08,250
I was just gettin' ready to escape
when Uncle Beck come down that hill...

944
01:40:08,318 --> 01:40:10,602
Just a rippin'
and a tearin'.

945
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:17,726
Thought we'd never see this place
again. It looks good, don't it?

946
01:40:17,793 --> 01:40:20,662
Well, bud, you wanna come in
and have a little bite to eat?

947
01:40:20,730 --> 01:40:24,466
I think I better. I'm hungry,
and my ears plumb wore out.

948
01:40:24,534 --> 01:40:27,335
I'll finish my story
later, Mr. Searcy.

949
01:40:27,404 --> 01:40:31,673
It do got a finish, don't it? Yes, sir.
I was savin' the best part for last.

950
01:40:36,729 --> 01:40:38,797
Jumper!

951
01:40:43,719 --> 01:40:46,454
Jumper, you're alive!
We didn't eat you after all.

952
01:40:48,708 --> 01:40:50,992
I'm so glad.

953
01:40:51,061 --> 01:40:55,264
You don't know how I missed ya
or how happy I am to see ya.

954
01:40:57,900 --> 01:41:02,137
How many times do I gotta tell you
to keep out of this here corn patch?

955
01:41:02,205 --> 01:41:05,406
Now get, you ornery mule!

956
01:41:11,464 --> 01:41:13,782
Dang mule!

957
01:41:16,686 --> 01:41:18,703
let me help you down.

958
01:41:20,690 --> 01:41:22,758
Thank you.

959
01:41:27,213 --> 01:41:30,616
Well, I guess I better
go fix some grub.

960
01:41:32,318 --> 01:41:34,786
No, Travis.
Cookin' is woman's work.

961
01:41:34,854 --> 01:41:37,089
You go fetch some wood.

962
01:41:41,677 --> 01:41:44,379
He's clean hooked, Bud. She's
planted his corn for good.

963
01:41:44,447 --> 01:41:46,381
Yeah. Funny thing,

964
01:41:46,449 --> 01:41:49,551
I never could learn for sure what
my little Lisbeth liked in him.

965
01:41:49,618 --> 01:41:52,187
Must've asked her a thousand
times. She never let me know.

966
01:41:52,255 --> 01:41:56,224
But now I can see for myself. He
must put her in mind of me. You?

967
01:41:56,292 --> 01:41:58,226
When I was his age.
Oh.

968
01:41:58,294 --> 01:42:00,662
'course I've never been "tooken" by
them Injuns. Much too smart for that.

969
01:42:00,729 --> 01:42:04,099
You was better lookin' too?
Well, not much. Maybe a mite.

970
01:42:04,167 --> 01:42:06,201
But I was a much better
horseman and marksman

971
01:42:06,202 --> 01:42:08,236
as you can plainly see
from that shot I made.

972
01:42:08,304 --> 01:42:10,522
<i>Yeah, that was dandy.</i>

973
01:42:15,695 --> 01:42:18,246
Stay with him, boy!

974
01:42:19,699 --> 01:42:22,785
Arliss. Arliss!

975
01:42:25,071 --> 01:42:27,773
Arliss. Arliss!

976
01:42:31,945 --> 01:42:34,413
He's quite a boy.

977
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:38,583
Yep. Kind of reminds me
of me when I was a boy.

978
01:42:44,290 --> 01:42:48,677
Sam! Go get him, Sam!
Nail him, boy. You got him!

979
01:42:53,682 --> 01:42:56,234
Go get him, Sam!
Eat him up!

980
01:42:58,337 --> 01:43:00,622
Get him, Sam!
Eat him up, boy!

981
01:43:09,265 --> 01:43:13,351
we were born in the west
in the land that's best

982
01:43:13,419 --> 01:43:17,155
but folks out here
never get much rest

983
01:43:17,222 --> 01:43:20,659
with dogs
and boys like me

984
01:43:20,726 --> 01:43:22,644
in the land

985
01:43:22,712 --> 01:43:28,183
of the wild country

986
01:43:34,418 --> 01:43:36,183
{{{ the end }}}
