00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:11,311
<i>If the love's on skids
Treat your folks like kids</i>

2
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:14,151
<i>Or your family tree's gonna snap!</i>

3
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:18,197
<i>So, to make 'em dig
First you gotta rig</i>

4
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,952
<i>What-do-ya gotta rig?</i>

00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:21,488
<i>The Parent Trap</i>

6
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:48,144
<i>If they lose that zing
And theyjust won't swing</i>

7
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:51,060
<i>Then the problem falls in your lap</i>

8
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:54,942
<i>When your folks are square
Then you must prepare</i>

9
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:56,773
<i>What-do-ya gotta prepare?</i>

10
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,191
<i>The Parent Trap</i>

11
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:24,851
<i>To set the bait
Recreate the date</i>

12
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,811
<i>The first time Cupid shot 'em</i>

13
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:31,479
<i>Get 'em under the moon
Play their favorite tune</i>

14
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:35,403
- John!
- Marcia!

15
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:37,938
<i>We got 'em!</i>

16
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:14,900
<i>Lead 'em back to love
With the velvet glove</i>

17
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,687
<i>As they're much too old for the strap</i>

18
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:21,691
<i>Straighten up their mess with togetherness</i>

19
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:24,820
<i>Togetherness!
The Parent Trap</i>

20
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:30,704
John, they're playing our song.

21
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:34,253
Marcia, what fools we've been.

22
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:39,008
<i>Straighten up their mess
With togetherness</i>

23
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:40,760
<i>Togetherness</i>

24
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,715
<i>Straighten up their mess
With togetherness</i>

25
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:47,345
<i>Togetherness!</i>

26
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,186
<i>The Parent Trap</i>

27
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:18,919
Now, now, that pole. Now, now.
A to Ks over here.

28
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,843
A to K's... No, dear, you're an R.
Over there with the P to S's.

29
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:24,174
- Thank you.
- That's a good girl.

30
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,506
Have we any X, Y, Z's here?

31
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,174
Now, here are your allergy pills.

32
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:30,594
Your grandmother said to remind you
"one, three times a day".

33
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:34,306
And your insect repellent
and your poetry book.

34
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,516
- Thank you, Staimes.
- Have a good summer, Miss.

35
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:44,403
- Name?
- McKendrick, Sharon.

36
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,988
- Eighteen Belgrave Square, Boston?
- Yes.

37
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,454
And my grandmother said to see
that my tent was properly ventilated.

38
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,458
Don't worry, McKendrick.
You'll be ventilated.

39
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,706
Next girl.

40
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:02,459
No candy wrappers, no chewing gum
wrappers lying on the ground, always tidy.

41
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:06,095
Latrines over there.
Mess hall up the hill.

42
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:10,391
McKendrick, you're in Arapahoe.
Follow me. Girls, wait here for me.

43
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:17,899
Come, McKendrick.
New arrival, girls. Name's McKendrick.

44
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,396
- Hi.
- Hello.

45
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,526
The girls here will brief you
on anything you need to know.

46
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,399
Sure you'll be very happy here, hm.

47
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:25,443
See you after lunch.

48
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:32,831
- My name is Betsy. This is Ursula.
- How do you do? I'm Sharon McKendrick.

49
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:39,162
Say, you're in a good tent.

50
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:42,795
Betsy's mother sends her all kinds
of candy bars and chocolates every week.

51
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,464
- I'm not allowed to eat candy.
- Why not?

52
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,882
My grandmother thinks it ruins my teeth.

53
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:50,965
Oh, hi, Mary...

54
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,433
Well, come on, let's go. I'm starved.

55
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:04,191
Oh, yeah, just found there
are three places.

56
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:06,947
Oh, is there? Oh!

57
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,029
The nerve of her!

58
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:13,287
- Coming here with your face.
- What are you gonna do about it?

59
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,865
Do? What in heaven's name can I do, silly?

60
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,747
I'd bite off her nose,
then she wouldn't look like you!

61
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,578
Who's she?

62
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:22,587
I never saw her before in my life.

63
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:26,505
Now... at this time,

64
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:31,552
I want to say welcome
to all our new arrivals.

65
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,434
Welcome to Camp Inch, new arrivals.

66
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:40,894
I am your supreme commander here
and my name is...

67
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,396
Miss Inch.

68
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,525
Uh, yes. Miss Inch.

69
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:54,576
I'd like, at this time, to introduce
a visitor from the next hilltop over,

70
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:57,456
From the Thunderhead Boys' Camp,

71
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,118
Chief Eaglewood.

72
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,338
Welcome...

73
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:11,341
Thank you, Miss Inch,
and hello there out there to all of you.

74
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:16,342
Uh, looks like a crackerjack troop
of girls there. Hm?

75
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:22,765
Now, why am I here?
Well, that's our little surprise.

76
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:27,278
Trooper Stafford, ten-shun!
Stand up, boy.

77
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,239
What a dream!

78
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,279
Little surprise for you, young ladies.

79
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:36,704
Saturday night,
we're going to have a dance.

80
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,867
Now, quiet, girls, quiet.

81
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:47,674
And we've asked the Thunderhead Boys'
Camp to come over for the occasion.

82
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,668
Camp Thunderhead accepts
your invitation and thanks you.

83
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:58,013
A word of warning. Watch your demerits.

84
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:01,554
Untidy little girls won't go to the dance.

85
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:07,060
So, keep those tents clean,
your uniforms spanking fresh,

86
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:11,865
and we'll all be one big happy family.

87
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,076
Oh, no.

88
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,966
What are you staring at?

89
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:36,218
Excuse me, but haven't you noticed?
We look like each other.

90
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:39,801
Hey, wait a minute.
Turn your head. Let me see that profile.

91
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:44,851
That's who it is. Look at that profile.
She's the spitting image of you-know-who.

92
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,851
- Who?
- Frankenstein.

93
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:52,067
Not wanted.

94
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:02,054
Those monsters! They gopher-trapped us!

95
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,851
- Morning, Miss Inch.
- Morning, Miss Grunecker.

96
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:14,688
- Where would you like to start?
- Well, why not start with tent Arapahoe?

97
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,697
I'm sure you'll find everything shipshape.

98
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,739
Oh!

99
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:35,090
<i>Think about what we could share</i>

100
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,461
<i>Let's get together every day</i>

101
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,005
<i>Every way and every where</i>

102
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:46,891
<i>And though we haven't got a lot
We could be sharing all we've got</i>

103
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:51,357
<i>Together
Oh...</i>

104
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:54,106
What if we got some ants
and when she comes by the window,

105
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,612
- we dump them down her dress?
- Impractical.

106
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:59,273
Where you gonna find ants
at night, stupid?

107
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:03,820
The three of them.
I'm so mad I could just spit.

108
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,863
<i>Together
Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

109
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,327
<i>Two is twice as nice as one</i>

110
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,953
<i>Let's get together, right away</i>

111
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:14,380
<i>We'll be having twice the fun</i>

112
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,498
<i>And you can always count on me...</i>

113
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:20,337
Hey. I got an idea. Come on.

114
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,299
<i>Let's get together, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

115
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,816
- How do you like camp?
- Oh, it's OK, I guess.

116
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:41,236
I'm not coming back to this one though.
They're so juvenile.

117
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,867
They won't let you wear
lipstick or perfume.

118
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:46,570
I feel absolutely naked
without my lipstick.

119
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:47,954
Oh.

120
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:52,994
- Where are you from?
- Uh, Monterey, California.

121
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:01,385
- That's great.
- Oh, you'd love California.

122
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,590
At least, I do.

123
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:05,639
It's so sort of, I don't know,
marvelous, actually.

124
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:08,301
- It sounds great.
- Mm-hm.

125
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:11,687
Oh, it's absolute fun
living in California.

126
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:16,483
Every year when I get from camp,
Dad takes me on a trek into the mountains.

127
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,568
- Gee, that's great.
- Mm-hm.

128
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,772
Your mother just lets you go up
in the mountains like that?

129
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:24,776
Oh, I don't have a mother.
Just Dad and me. He's wonderful.

130
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:30,198
Besides, I know most everything
about trails and camping and wood lore.

131
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,788
We have a ball.
Just Daddy and me and Hecky.

132
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:37,162
- Oh! It's hot out here.
- Who's Hecky?

133
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:41,125
Our ranch foreman.
He tells sensational stories.

134
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,464
He used to be
a rodeo rider, actually.

135
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:47,180
Oh, they've started the music again.

136
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:51,010
- I guess we oughta, huh?
- Mm-hm. I love dancing.

137
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:54,680
I could just dance all night,
especially with you, Wilfred.

138
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,268
- Oh!
- Where were you?

139
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,767
- Where could she have done it?
- Oh, I don't know. I wasn't anywhere.

140
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,103
I just went out...

141
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,193
Serves you right.
Stay out of our tent from now on.

142
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:48,154
You vicious little wretch!

143
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:54,073
Stop it! Sharon, let go!

144
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:05,835
Stop that! Ladies, please...

145
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,511
Stop it! Girls! Stop!

146
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:10,259
Stop, stop, please, let's just stop...

147
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:16,928
Hey!

148
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:21,191
I've got a cake in my hands! Now stop it.

149
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:29,942
You little wretches!

150
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:37,450
Congratulations.

151
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:42,459
In the history of our camp,
that was the most infamous,

152
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:49,462
the most revolting, the most disgusting
display of hooliganism we have ever had.

153
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,927
Brawling like hooligans
in front of our guests.

154
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:58,145
And worst of all, two sisters
who should be setting a good example.

155
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:03,063
- We're not sisters.
- I've never seen her before in my life.

156
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:08,398
- They are, aren't they?
- No, ma'am. Just lookalikes.

157
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:12,197
An amazing resemblance.

158
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:24,338
I gather that you two girls don't
get along together.

159
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:31,087
Hm. Well, have you ever heard
of Gilbert and Sullivan?

160
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:32,587
Yes, ma'am.

161
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,427
They were composers.

162
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:44,692
They wrote a memorable song called
"Let the Punishment Fit the Crime".

163
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,895
Let the punishment fit the crime.

164
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:55,490
Sharon McKendrick, we are waiting.

165
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,837
All right, girls, follow me.

166
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:06,273
Now, girls, that's enough of this
nonsense. Go back to your activities.

167
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:08,351
All right, young ladies.

168
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:18,410
In here...

169
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:29,079
Yes...

170
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:31,669
Yes...

171
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:37,345
Four weeks left at camp
and you'll spend them all together.

172
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,849
Room together, eat together,
play together.

173
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:45,475
Either you'll find a way
to live with each other,

174
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:50,936
or you'll punish yourselves far better
than I ever could. Goodbye, girls.

175
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:20,802
It drives her crazy.
I completely ignore her.

176
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:23,638
- Give it to her good!
- The old Coventry treatment.

177
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:27,267
Pretty soon the silence will drive
her absolutely out of her mind.

178
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,924
- Oh, my gosh!
- Oh, my goodness! Hurry! Quick!

179
00:18:56,177 --> 00:19:00,137
I've got it! Hook it.
Turn it down over there. Tight.

180
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:04,675
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

181
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:09,938
Oh, gosh! Look at this mess!

182
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,904
- Are any of them spoiled?
- Well, it didn't do them any good.

183
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:22,113
Oh, dirty darn!
Look at this one. Just ruined.

184
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:25,530
Oh, that's a shame. Who is he?

185
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:28,991
Are you kidding? Ricky Nelson.

186
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:32,331
Oh. Your boyfriend?

187
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:36,040
I wish he was!
You mean you never heard of him?

188
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:40,134
Where do you come from? Outer space?

189
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:43,885
No. I'm from Boston.

190
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,934
Oh. Boston.

191
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:55,518
- Where's your home?
- California.

192
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:59,609
Oh, I've seen movies of California.
Is it a nice place to live?

193
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,824
Sensational. We got a ranch out in Carmel.

194
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:05,820
I got a picture. You wanna see it?

195
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:13,915
There. That's the house.
Then the stables go off down there.

196
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:17,248
- How lovely.
- Oh, I got my own horse and everything.

197
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:19,500
We've got a lake.

198
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:22,294
You know, you can practically fall
right out of the front door.

199
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:24,300
and go swimming anytime you want.

200
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:33,977
- Who is this?
- That's my dad. Isn't he dreamy?

201
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:37,817
He's very handsome.

202
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:43,073
- Is it cold in here?
- I'm hot.

203
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,032
Want a Fig Newton?

204
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,196
What's your pop like?

205
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:53,409
I mean, is he a friend you could talk
to or one of those busy types?

206
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:56,586
Well, I don't have a father, actually.

207
00:20:57,298 --> 00:21:00,757
Mummy and Daddy separated years ago.
She never mentions him now.

208
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:05,925
You know, it's scary the way nobody
stays together anymore these days.

209
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:09,342
Pretty soon there's gonna be
more divorces than marriages.

210
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,013
Isn't it the truth?

211
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,310
- How old are you?
- 13.

212
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:19,477
So am I. I can't wait till I'm 18.

213
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:23,272
I'll get my own car
and stay out dancing till midnight.

214
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:28,911
- I'll be 14 November 12.
- No kidding? That's my birthday, too.

215
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,821
Isn't that peculiar?

216
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,742
- November 12?
- Mm-hm.

217
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:38,287
Funny, isn't it? Uh-oh.

218
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,087
This one's full.

219
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:44,588
Hey, what do you know,
it's stopped raining.

220
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:08,776
- What is your mother like?
- I can't remember her.

221
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:11,950
- Did she die?
- Nope.

222
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:15,912
Busted up with Dad when I was young.
But she was fabulous.

223
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:19,494
- Absolutely fabulous.
- How do you know?

224
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:21,667
There used to be a picture of her
at Daddy's desk.

225
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:25,004
But he once caught me looking at it
and it's never been around since.

226
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:33,808
Hey, do you want to come to the commissary
and get a popsicle with me?

227
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:36,978
Can you only think about your stomach
at a time like this?

228
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:38,938
At a time like what?

229
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:46,772
Don't you feel it?
Don't you know what's happening?

230
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:51,701
Don't you find it peculiar
that we both look so much alike

231
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:53,657
and have the same birthday?

232
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:57,411
It's just one of those things, isn't it?

233
00:23:00,254 --> 00:23:03,292
Will you come inside a minute, please?

234
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:16,343
Mother always says I'm psychic.

235
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:20,852
You know, that I can sense things
when something odd is going to happen.

236
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:24,230
I always get goose bumps. Look.

237
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:26,311
So what?

238
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,539
I don't understand.

239
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:47,749
What are you doing with her picture?

240
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:51,712
It's my mother.

241
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:57,600
But it's my mother, too.

242
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,570
Uh... Lunch.

243
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:15,035
You go. I'm not hungry.

244
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,831
Why are you a chicken about...

245
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:05,294
- I didn't know what to say.
- I know. I didn't either.

246
00:25:06,797 --> 00:25:09,289
Golly! Sisters!

247
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:23,678
You know what probably happened?

248
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,727
They must have quarreled and parted,

249
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:31,395
and just sort of bisected us,
each taking one of us.

250
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:35,820
- Why do you suppose they separated?
- I don't know.

251
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:40,412
I can't imagine anyone not loving Mother.
She's absolutely divine.

252
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:43,873
Well, what about Dad?
He's a sensational person.

253
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:45,867
I mean, as a friend and all.

254
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:50,546
The thing is that neither of them
got married again.

255
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:53,921
- You see what that means?
- Not really.

256
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,878
Secretly, in their innermost hearts,

257
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:59,464
they must still be
in love with each other.

258
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:02,968
Then why have they stayed separated
all of these years?

259
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:06,479
'Cause that's how true love creates
its beautiful agony.

260
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:10,316
All splendid lovers have
just dreadful times.

261
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:14,904
Uh, Pelleas and Melisande,
Daphnis and Chloe.

262
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:19,321
History's just jammed with stories
of lovers parted by some silly thing.

263
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:24,368
Uh-oh. Oh...

264
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:28,493
Oh...

265
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:31,125
Oh, my goodness.

266
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:35,668
Oh, boy! Oh, my gosh! Oh!

267
00:26:36,053 --> 00:26:37,134
What's the matter?

268
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:41,840
You want to meet Father
and I'm just dying to know Mother.

269
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,891
Well, what if...

270
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:49,018
Oh, my gosh, this is simply so scary,
that we might be able to pull it off.

271
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:50,389
Pull what off?

272
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:56,737
- Switch places.
- Switch?

273
00:26:56,907 --> 00:27:00,696
We could do it. We're twins, aren't we?
Oh, I want to know Mother.

274
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:03,570
Look! Now I'm getting goose bumps.

275
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:09,246
Me too... You know something?

276
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:11,832
There's more to it
than just switching places

277
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:15,082
- I believe fate brought us together.
- How so?

278
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:18,631
If we switched, sooner or later
they'd have to unswitch us.

279
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:21,671
And Mother would bring me
to California to unmix us.

280
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:24,508
- And they'd have to meet again.
- Face to face.

281
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:29,554
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- Exactly.

282
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:30,812
Let's get to work.

283
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:53,916
- Hm?
- It's amazing.

284
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:58,921
Now, I think you should wear
this one when you go to meet Dad.

285
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:01,465
Oh! This is gorgeous!

286
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:05,511
I'm going to wear this one
when I go to Boston. Oh, I adore it!

287
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:07,850
Now, Susan, will you pay attention?

288
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,978
Now, the music room and library are
on the first floor.

289
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:14,604
Now, your room is the second door
on the second floor on the left.

290
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,935
- All right?
- Now, the horse's name is

291
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:19,066
Schotzli and the dog is Andromeda.

292
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:21,906
Verbena collects the dirty laundry
every Monday...

293
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:24,112
Sharon, will you pay attention?

294
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:27,241
Now, except for the dirty socks.
Those are Thursday.

295
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:31,040
And... Oh, yeah.
My favorite food is chili beans.

296
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:33,455
Oh, and you gotta chew gum
'cause I always chew gum.

297
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:36,458
Um, flat A's.
You must summon up all your A's as flat.

298
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,800
Uh, talk fast, you know,
'cause, see, everybody talks fast. Um...

299
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:43,260
But I never bite my nails!

300
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:48,426
Sharon, you gotta. I always chew mine.
Anyhow, Dad'll know.

301
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:50,555
Go on, bite 'em!

302
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:59,022
Can't. Shan't. Aunt. Hm?

303
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:02,280
No, no.
Can't. Shan't. Aunt.

304
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:04,982
Can't. Shan't. Aunt.

305
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:08,161
Oh, I can't wait till camp is over.

306
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:11,748
- Can't wait.
- OK. I can't wait.

307
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:19,793
- But, Daddy, that's...
- You're not going to take it home,

308
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:20,999
- and that's it!
- Oh, honey...

309
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,667
- She's not gonna take it home.
- Daddy, you big meanie!

310
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:24,843
- What difference does it make?
- Well, she's not taking it home.

311
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:28,973
It took so much time to get him.
Oh, baby.

312
00:29:32,062 --> 00:29:33,928
It's got to be done methodically.

313
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:36,564
Remember the key.
Recollection and memory.

314
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,812
Get her talking about how she
and Daddy first met.

315
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:41,940
And their first date.
Find out about that first date.

316
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:44,363
- Sharon!
- That's you now.

317
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:48,197
- Oh, yes, coming.
- Now look. The most important thing.

318
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:52,702
You must bring Mother to California.
Boston is no place to rekindle a romance.

319
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:55,534
Sharon McKendrick!

320
00:29:56,044 --> 00:30:01,130
Goodbye, girls. Sharon McKendrick!
Your chauffeur's waiting for you, dear.

321
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:04,425
Now hurry.
Oh, Sharon...

322
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,088
The punishment was harsh, I know,
putting you two girls together

323
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:11,299
but you've survived it and I hope
you've both learned something

324
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:14,594
- from the experience.
- Oh, boy. You'd be surprised, Miss Inch.

325
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:19,308
Oh, yes. Well, goodbye, Sharon.
See you next summer.

326
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:20,562
Goodbye, Miss Inch.

327
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:26,736
Oh, I can't tell you how very much
I've enjoyed my stay.

328
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:31,236
I shan't tell my aunt
about the aunts... ants,

329
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:35,623
nor the debutantes, shall I? Bye.

330
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:43,665
- What did you do to your hair?
- Oh, I cut it. It was too hot long.

331
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:45,587
You wait till your grandmother
sees what you've done.

332
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:50,671
Bye.

333
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:04,319
Miss Lockness, Bettina.
Upstairs. Third door to the left.

334
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:07,647
Ugh... What's her name? Miss...

335
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:26,499
Well, here goes nothin'.

336
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:28,918
What?

337
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:38,227
...with the white wine, the massou
and with the meat...

338
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,517
Do we have any more
of the Louis St. George?

339
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:44,434
I think we'd better have cloakroom tickets
for the ladies' wraps as well.

340
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:47,228
Oh, Rosa, I want all the gilt chairs
in the music room.

341
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:49,446
And do see that they're well-dusted.

342
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:52,282
Miss McKendrick,
you asked me to remind you. Clinking.

343
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:54,656
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes,
and do see that the maids keep

344
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:56,737
absolutely quiet during the music.

345
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:59,495
And if they must empty the ashtrays,
tell them to do it without clinking.

346
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,746
- I'll see to it.
- I want both the Steinways

347
00:32:01,962 --> 00:32:04,705
at the north end of the music room.
Have you checked about delivery?

348
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:06,835
- Oh, I'll see about it right now.
- I'll tell you what...

349
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:10,961
- Well, you're home from camp, are you?
- Hello, Miss Lockness.

350
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,136
Did you bring home all your underwear
and personal things?

351
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:16,303
- Yes, it's in my luggage. Staimes has it.
- Probably full of germs.

352
00:32:17,144 --> 00:32:20,057
- What have you done to your hair?
- Do you like it?

353
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,063
Wait till your grandmother
sees what you've done.

354
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:29,404
Who's that I hear out there?
Is that my little girl?

355
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:33,532
- That tall, gangly thing?
- Hi, Grandfather.

356
00:32:33,827 --> 00:32:36,410
Hello, sweetheart. Oh, my, my, my.

357
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:41,332
Oh, well, well, well.
Let me look at you. Have you had...

358
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:45,378
- What's the matter, dear?
- I'm just happy to see you.

359
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:47,546
Oh, and I'm happy to see you too.

360
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:50,876
I tell you, your grandpa missed you
around here, you know.

361
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:55,968
It was an awful... Wait a minute.
Wait, wait, wait. What are you doing?

362
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:59,141
- Making a memory.
- Making a memory?

363
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:02,770
Mm-hm, all my life, years from now,
when I'm quite grown up,

364
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:06,308
I'll remember my grandfather
and how he always smelt of...

365
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:11,480
- tobacco and peppermint.
- "Smelled of tobacco and peppermint!"

366
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:15,821
Well, I tell you what.
I use the peppermint for my indigestion.

367
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:19,783
And the tobacco
to make your grandmother mad.

368
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:23,332
Sharon!

369
00:33:24,461 --> 00:33:25,668
Sharon!

370
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:28,253
Welcome home, darling.

371
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:37,221
- Mother!
- Darling. It's so good to have you home.

372
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:38,843
Let me take a look at you...

373
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:42,435
What on earth have you done to your hair?

374
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:46,021
- Cut it.
- Well, that's certainly obvious.

375
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:48,691
I thought there was something different.

376
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:52,812
Well, what's done is done.
At least it'll grow again.

377
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:58,823
What's the matter, Sharon?
Are those tears I see?

378
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:02,572
I can't help it, Mother.

379
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:06,125
- If only you knew.
- Knew what?

380
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:09,749
Why, Sharon! When did you get back?

381
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:11,960
She just arrived.
Doesn't she look wonderful?

382
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:16,252
Yes... My dear child,
what have you done to your hair?

383
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:19,218
- She cut it.
- Well, I had to because, when it...

384
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:22,717
If my opinion means anything
in this house, which I doubt,

385
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,601
I like it short, the way it is.

386
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:28,185
- Charles, stop burbling.
- I haven't burbled in years.

387
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:30,603
Go down to your office
and read your newspaper.

388
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:35,605
- See you at dinner.
- Bye.

389
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:38,574
Oh, now really, Mother.
It doesn't look so bad.

390
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:44,239
It's hoydenish. Are you a boy or a girl?
Make up your mind. What's that?

391
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:48,417
Oh, it's a present I brought for you.
We made it... I mean, I made it

392
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:51,083
- especially for you.
- Thank you, dear. What is it?

393
00:34:51,548 --> 00:34:53,710
It's a birdcage made
out of popsicle sticks.

394
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:57,426
Oh, come on upstairs with me
while I finish getting dressed.

395
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:58,753
See you later.

396
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:07,181
Did you make some nice friends at camp?

397
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,267
Oh, yes. One girl in particular.

398
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:11,857
- Who is she?
- Oh, just a girl.

399
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:15,603
- From Boston?
- No. Just a girl from someplace.

400
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,569
My goodness, you're beautiful.

401
00:35:21,995 --> 00:35:23,156
What's the matter?

402
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:26,580
You're staring at me as if
you've never seen me before.

403
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,710
Oh, I don't know.
I'm just happy you're here.

404
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,286
And that you're you.

405
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,582
Well, I'm happy that you're here
and you're you.

406
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:37,963
Now be a good girl. Fasten me up.

407
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:44,098
- Did you miss me?
- Mm-hm. Did you miss me?

408
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,137
You'll never know.

409
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:49,471
Margaret, don't forget
the Red Cross meeting at 2:30.

410
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:52,018
I'll see you at the Somerset Club
after my garden club meeting.

411
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:54,062
Oh, stand up, child. Don't slouch.

412
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:57,778
I hope you haven't picked up bad habits
at that camp of yours.

413
00:35:57,947 --> 00:35:59,108
Keep your shoulders straight.

414
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:01,069
- See you at the Somerset, Margaret.
- Yes, Mother.

415
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:04,152
What's the frown for?

416
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:07,947
I've just got back and you've got
all those meetings and things.

417
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,283
Well, I thought we could
spend the day together and talk.

418
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,292
Oh, we have the whole weekend to talk,

419
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:15,288
and you know very well
that I cannot cancel the Red Cross.

420
00:36:27,394 --> 00:36:29,681
Well, what I have to say can wait.

421
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,393
- Yes, dear?
- I just wanted to have

422
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:37,355
a little woman-to-woman talk with you
about Stafford.

423
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,732
Stafford? Who's Stafford?

424
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:44,901
Oh, this boy I met at camp.
I just wanted your advice on something.

425
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:47,362
Yes? On what?

426
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:54,874
Well, uh, I wanted you to tell me how long
you waited before you got married.

427
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:01,925
Sharon?

428
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:13,012
- Oh, Lockness?
- Yes, Miss Margaret.

429
00:37:13,273 --> 00:37:15,356
Please tell my mother
that I won't be able to meet her

430
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:17,809
and cancel all of my appointments
for today.

431
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:21,020
- Cancel them?
- Yes. Something important has come up.

432
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:22,817
Yes, Miss Margaret.

433
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:32,366
Sharon, what I'm trying to say is
that the decision to marry is

434
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:35,452
something best considered
after you've lived a bit longer.

435
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:39,748
Mother, you're perfectly right.
Stafford was much too juvenile for me.

436
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,292
Well, thank goodness for that.

437
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:46,716
To be perfectly frank with you,
the old zing just wasn't there.

438
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:49,048
- Zing?
- Yes. You know...

439
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:51,054
The charge that shoots up your spine

440
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:54,853
when you meet the one man you want
to marry. Like when you met Daddy.

441
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,482
What was Daddy like?

442
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:04,401
Well, I don't know
how we got around to him.

443
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,408
Is it terribly painful for you
to talk about Daddy?

444
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:10,695
No. Why should it be?

445
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,197
I don't know.

446
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:16,917
Well, I thought maybe when you've been
in love with somebody once...

447
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:22,632
well, the recollection and memory might be
bitterly painful.

448
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:26,840
Oh, Sharon, that was many,
many years ago. Don't dramatize it.

449
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,047
Where did he take you
on your very first date?

450
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:32,804
He... he took me to dinner.

451
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:36,346
It was an Italian restaurant, one of those
down in those old basements in New York.

452
00:38:36,523 --> 00:38:40,312
- It was called Martinelli's.
- Martinelli's?

453
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:42,772
- Yes.
- Hm.

454
00:38:44,781 --> 00:38:48,115
You said there was music.
What song did they play?

455
00:38:48,785 --> 00:38:51,619
- Song?
- Oh, there must have been a song.

456
00:38:52,205 --> 00:38:55,323
You know, the old
"they're playing our song" type of thing.

457
00:38:55,792 --> 00:38:58,330
Oh, well, if there was,
I wouldn't remember it.

458
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:01,328
- It was much too long ago.
- Oh.

459
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:10,759
<i>La dee dum bah dee</i>

460
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:14,967
<i>La dee dum bah dee</i>

461
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:19,598
<i>La dee
La dee dum</i>

462
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:23,984
<i>La dah</i>

463
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:28,651
<i>Though time may tatter</i>

464
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:33,410
<i>Our first sweet thrill</i>

465
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:37,038
<i>It doesn't matter</i>

466
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:39,617
<i>It never will</i>

467
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:45,706
<i>La dee dum lah dee</i>

468
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:49,210
<i>La dee dum la dum</i>

469
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:52,634
<i>La dee la dee dum</i>

470
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:55,549
<i>La dah</i>

471
00:40:50,657 --> 00:40:51,898
Susie!

472
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:56,615
- Hi, Peanut.
- Hi, Dad.

473
00:40:57,705 --> 00:41:00,118
- Well, how was the camp?
- Fine.

474
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,162
No broken bones or anything? No?

475
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:04,705
Come on, let's get the bags.

476
00:41:10,927 --> 00:41:14,921
- Here's my baggage check.
- Oh, boy. Are you still biting your nails?

477
00:41:15,348 --> 00:41:18,432
Oh, you noticed. She told me that you...

478
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:22,011
- What?
- Nothing.

479
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:28,017
Well, I certainly did enjoy all those
nice, long newsy letters. Yes, sir.

480
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,902
Oh, that. Well, we meant to write,

481
00:41:31,114 --> 00:41:35,609
but we just got so tied up with plans
and things, you know, that, well, we...

482
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:38,240
- Who's we?
- Uh, uh...

483
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:44,497
Us. I mean, I... Oh, us, yes!
There was a very nice girl there.

484
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:46,247
We became quite good friends.

485
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:50,088
Oh, that's mine. That's mine. There.

486
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:02,810
- Glad to be home, huh?
- It's wonderful.

487
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:06,229
Were you lonely while I was gone?

488
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:09,771
Well, I cried myself to sleep every night
about the first week...

489
00:42:09,986 --> 00:42:11,193
No, no. Seriously.

490
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:14,856
Well, seriously, I got to play golf
every day, I played poker at night,

491
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:17,571
and I wish I could find one of these camps
where they keep you all winter, too.

492
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:19,868
- Ho, ho.
- Ho, ho.

493
00:42:20,747 --> 00:42:22,113
It's good to have you home, goofy.

494
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:29,211
Ah, Susie, there's been a lot of things
happening since you left

495
00:42:29,422 --> 00:42:32,085
and I think we ought to have
a little quiet talk sometime.

496
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:35,384
Oh, sure, I have some things
I want to talk over with you, too.

497
00:42:35,595 --> 00:42:36,836
- Oh, you have, huh?
- Mm-hm.

498
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:38,387
- But not now.
- OK.

499
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:42,641
Now I just want to think about getting
home and being with my father.

500
00:42:44,437 --> 00:42:47,601
- My very own father.
- Own "fatha"?

501
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:50,690
- Father.
- Father.

502
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,487
Oh, Daddy, it's beautiful!

503
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:04,951
Well, it's just about the same.

504
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:06,449
You didn't think it was gonna change,
did you?

505
00:43:06,626 --> 00:43:08,242
- Hecky!
- Ho!

506
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:09,869
Look!

507
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:13,505
Oh, Sue-Sue! What have you got there
with you, Mitch?

508
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:15,750
- Hi, Hecky.
- Hiya, darlin'.

509
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:22,135
What'd you have to bring this kid
back for? I thought we'd got rid of her.

510
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:23,552
Oh, she was hanging around the airport.

511
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:25,384
I thought I might as well get
her out of there.

512
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,933
- Uh-huh. How was camp?
- Oh, swell.

513
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:31,273
For heaven's sake, it's about time.
We've been waiting for you all day!

514
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:33,187
Hi, Verbena.

515
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:35,940
Never mind that "hi."
You just give me a hug.

516
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:39,197
Hello, honey. Let me get a look at you.

517
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:43,490
You know, there...
there's a change in you.

518
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:48,498
- Just the same as I always was.
- No. No, you're not.

519
00:43:48,918 --> 00:43:50,875
I'm not quite sure what it is.

520
00:43:51,963 --> 00:43:53,079
Hi, Andromeda.

521
00:43:54,841 --> 00:43:58,005
Stop that, Andromeda.
What's wrong with you?

522
00:43:58,678 --> 00:44:01,261
You crazy dog. It's Susan, you silly.

523
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,974
Oh, it's almost as if
your own dog didn't know you.

524
00:44:05,393 --> 00:44:09,808
Funny, isn't it?
Dogs are funny things.

525
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:13,440
Well, I guess I'll go up to my room
and put...

526
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:36,622
Come on, we'll get you unpacked
while you tell me about camp.

527
00:44:36,883 --> 00:44:37,873
Coming.

528
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:44,884
I want you to tell me
about all the things you did at that camp.

529
00:44:45,141 --> 00:44:46,848
I want that laundry of yours too.

530
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:49,551
Come down when you get through, honey.
There's somebody I want you to meet.

531
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:51,428
Yeah, all right then.
We'll be down in a minute.

532
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:55,103
Hello, darling. Oh, Mitch.
I was wondering when you'd get back.

533
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:57,692
I was beginning to get so bored
sitting here.

534
00:44:58,863 --> 00:45:01,150
Well? Did you tell her anything about us?

535
00:45:12,752 --> 00:45:14,960
- Good to be home again?
- Sure is.

536
00:45:16,297 --> 00:45:19,916
Verbena, there's a woman downstairs.

537
00:45:20,301 --> 00:45:22,634
Mm-hm. There is indeed.

538
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:26,926
Well, who is she? What is she doing here?

539
00:45:28,226 --> 00:45:31,719
I'm not saying a word.
I mind my own business.

540
00:45:33,356 --> 00:45:36,770
Except if he wants to make a ninny
of himself, that's his affair.

541
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:38,100
I don't say a word.

542
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:41,986
- Well, how did she get here?
- It's none of my never-mind.

543
00:45:42,198 --> 00:45:43,655
I don't say a word.

544
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:51,284
Except a man like your father
with a grown daughter going on 14...

545
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:55,080
He's not what you'd call
one of those charm fellows

546
00:45:55,211 --> 00:45:59,046
with the big teethy grin
and a lot of artistic clever talk,

547
00:45:59,215 --> 00:46:01,298
so what does a young girl like her
see in him?

548
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:02,503
I don't know.

549
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:06,253
I'll give you a million reasons
and he's got 'em right in the bank.

550
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:11,179
- Oh, it was always thus.
- What was always thus?

551
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:14,057
I'm not saying a word.

552
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:18,186
I'm not one to talk about anybody
behind their back.

553
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:25,902
But she's good. She's awful good.

554
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:30,486
Those cool blue eyes
looking right through you. Calm, that one.

555
00:46:30,955 --> 00:46:34,414
Go riding together, swimming together,
out to dinner every night.

556
00:46:34,667 --> 00:46:37,910
But it's none of my business, understand,
so that's why I'm not saying a word.

557
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:39,495
Not one single word.

558
00:46:39,714 --> 00:46:41,751
Besides, I don't think
you oughta talk about people...

559
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:58,392
Hi, Susie. We were just talking about you.

560
00:46:59,108 --> 00:47:01,475
- Uh, this is Miss Robinson.
- How do you do?

561
00:47:01,694 --> 00:47:05,358
Hello, darling, I've been looking forward
to meeting you for just weeks now.

562
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:10,150
From the way your father talked I expected
a little girl. You're practically a woman.

563
00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:14,580
- I'm nearly 14.
- I think I'll make a couple of Martinis.

564
00:47:14,749 --> 00:47:16,115
- You want one?
- I'd love one.

565
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,332
How about you, honey?
You want root beer, ginger ale

566
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:19,913
- or something?
- Can I have a ginger ale?

567
00:47:20,129 --> 00:47:22,496
Sure. You go on and get acquainted.
I'll be just a minute.

568
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:26,208
Your father tells me you were
away at camp, dear. Was it fun?

569
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:28,301
Yes, it was lovely, thank you.

570
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:32,347
You know, ever since I met your father,
it's been Susan this and Susan that.

571
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:36,184
You're obviously very good friends,
and I think that's just wonderful.

572
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:39,847
I can tell you something else too
if you can keep a secret?

573
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:42,975
- From whom?
- From your father.

574
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:45,985
Oh. Then you'd better not tell me.

575
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:49,189
Daddy and I don't keep secrets
from one another.

576
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:51,650
We tell each other everything.

577
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:56,367
Oh, well, no, dear.
It wasn't that kind of a secret.

578
00:47:57,041 --> 00:48:00,159
I just wanted to confide in you
that I find him a very special,

579
00:48:00,336 --> 00:48:01,668
wonderful kind of person.

580
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:07,917
Well, just between us,
he's not too brilliant or clever

581
00:48:08,094 --> 00:48:09,130
with what he says.

582
00:48:09,637 --> 00:48:13,176
You know, like the charm fellows
we all adore so.

583
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:17,475
We were riding the other day.
Your father let me ride Schotzli.

584
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:23,390
I understand she's your horse.
I hope you don't mind my riding her.

585
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:28,733
Oh, no, Schotzli and I are
used to strange women riding her.

586
00:48:29,782 --> 00:48:30,818
What?

587
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:34,909
You know Daddy.
He's always playing the field.

588
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:38,698
- No, I didn't know.
- Oh, yes.

589
00:48:39,375 --> 00:48:42,163
Every week, mostly,
he has some different dame up here.

590
00:48:43,087 --> 00:48:48,424
One week, I'll never forget,
he had five different women up here.

591
00:48:48,801 --> 00:48:52,420
- You don't say.
- Course, it's none of my business

592
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:55,597
if he wants to make a ninny of himself
with all those women.

593
00:48:56,308 --> 00:49:00,222
That's why I'm not saying a word.
Not one single word.

594
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:05,854
Here you are.
Now, did you two get to know each other?

595
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:07,313
Yes.

596
00:49:08,404 --> 00:49:10,441
We had a lovely little talk.

597
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:53,654
- Hello?
- Miss Susan Evers?

598
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:56,111
- Yes, this is her.
- Go ahead, please.

599
00:49:56,702 --> 00:50:00,662
- Sue? It's Sharon. How's everything?
- Oh, Mother's the absolute living end!

600
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:02,947
She's gorgeous, just breathtaking.

601
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:07,461
I got her talking about their first date
today. Italian dinner, drippy candles,

602
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:09,295
<i>- checkered table cloths and...</i>
- Susan, will you listen!

603
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:11,039
Oh, I got their song. It goes like this.

604
00:50:11,467 --> 00:50:12,628
<i>For now, for always...</i>

605
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:16,215
Susan, I've got something to tell you.

606
00:50:17,056 --> 00:50:18,092
<i>- Susan!</i>
- What?

607
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:20,803
We're in trouble, you'll have to bring
Mother out here immediately.

608
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:23,677
No! Holy smokes.
I just had one day with her.

609
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:25,140
I hardly got to know her at all!

610
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:27,431
Susan, it's an emergency.
There's a woman out here.

611
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:29,892
<i>- Huh?</i>
- Her name's Vicky and she's beautiful.

612
00:50:30,236 --> 00:50:33,070
Oh, is that all? Don't be silly.
Dad'd never get serious.

613
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:35,355
But he's serious about this one.

614
00:50:35,533 --> 00:50:37,775
He's trying to get Vicky and me
to be friends. She dangerous.

615
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:39,822
Well, bust it up, for heaven's sakes.

616
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:42,321
Follow him wherever he goes
and submarine her.

617
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:44,657
You've got to tell Mother
and come out here to help.

618
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,912
I want some more time with her.

619
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:48,493
You've had her for 13 years

620
00:50:48,671 --> 00:50:50,378
- and I just got here... I won't!
- Susan!

621
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:52,956
Do the best you can for a couple
of days and stay on Daddy's tail.

622
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:54,791
- That's all.
- Susan, please!

623
00:50:54,969 --> 00:50:58,087
I won't give up Mother this soon
and that's final. Goodbye.

624
00:50:59,098 --> 00:51:00,259
Susan!

625
00:51:09,692 --> 00:51:12,981
I'm glad you've come along today, honey,
'cause there's something I wanted to talk

626
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:14,394
to you about. It's kind of important.

627
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:17,776
- Well, what is it?
- You know the girl you met at the house?

628
00:51:17,992 --> 00:51:19,073
- Vicky?
- Mm-hm?

629
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:23,536
Well, I thought that we ought to be alone
a little while so we could talk.

630
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:27,120
Well, I wanted to talk to you
about something, too, Dad.

631
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:29,075
Oh? OK. Go ahead.

632
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:33,330
All those weeks at camp,
I've been wondering about my mother.

633
00:51:33,966 --> 00:51:35,002
What?

634
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:37,714
What do you want to start wondering
about something like that for?

635
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:41,672
Why, it's a perfectly natural thing
for a girl to do. Where is she?

636
00:51:42,141 --> 00:51:43,973
I don't know where she is.
How should I know?

637
00:51:44,143 --> 00:51:46,635
Last thing I heard she went to Spain
and married some drunk.

638
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:49,012
Daddy, that's not true. Now, stop it.

639
00:51:49,315 --> 00:51:51,807
All right, I lost track of her.
You wouldn't like her anyway, honey.

640
00:51:51,984 --> 00:51:58,106
She had these big staring eyes, red frizzy
hair and, besides she was fat, really fat.

641
00:51:58,616 --> 00:52:00,232
Then why did you fall in love with her?

642
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:05,575
Well, you know, you lose your head
sometimes. Besides, I...

643
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:06,904
Wait just a minute.

644
00:52:09,418 --> 00:52:13,332
Hey, Fletcher? Play on through.
I'll pick you up at the bar.

645
00:52:16,634 --> 00:52:18,091
Well, sit down.

646
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:23,801
Now, honey, you don't want to start
thinking about your mother

647
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:25,719
all of a sudden. There's...

648
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:27,675
Well, there's no need for that.

649
00:52:27,895 --> 00:52:30,308
You can always come and talk to me
about anything. You always have.

650
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:32,305
Well, it's not the same.

651
00:52:32,775 --> 00:52:37,861
Well, father and daughter is OK,
but when a girl gets to a certain age,

652
00:52:38,322 --> 00:52:40,484
that's when she really misses a mother.

653
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:44,701
Why? I mean...

654
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:50,957
- You mean to talk about certain things?
- Yeah.

655
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:52,534
That?

656
00:52:54,672 --> 00:52:57,881
I guess we never have just sat down
and talked about that, have we?

657
00:52:58,509 --> 00:53:02,128
Well, this is kind of an odd place,
but I guess it's as good as any.

658
00:53:02,805 --> 00:53:05,548
Um, well, we might as well
get it over with.

659
00:53:07,393 --> 00:53:11,103
- How much do you know now already?
- About what?

660
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:15,439
- About what you were just talking about.
- Oh, nothing. Absolutely nothing.

661
00:53:15,651 --> 00:53:16,641
Nothing?

662
00:53:16,819 --> 00:53:19,653
Well, you never brought up the subject
and I wondered why.

663
00:53:21,365 --> 00:53:24,733
Well, honey... All right.

664
00:53:24,952 --> 00:53:28,866
We oughta get straight on one thing first.
That's little boys.

665
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:35,499
I know how they are because, being a man,
I used to be a little boy once, so I know.

666
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:37,996
- I don't know what...
- Take my word for it

667
00:53:38,132 --> 00:53:40,249
because I used to be
a little boy at one time, and I know.

668
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:45,588
- I know about it.
- Daddy, you're too funny for words.

669
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:47,213
What do you mean "funny"?

670
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:51,138
Well, I've known about all that
for simply years.

671
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:55,017
Well, what the heck
were you just talking about then?

672
00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:59,693
- Well, what were you talking about?
- Well...

673
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:07,783
I'd better go and putt out.

674
00:54:12,458 --> 00:54:13,915
There's the little beast now.

675
00:54:20,007 --> 00:54:22,090
Why, she's nothing but a child.

676
00:54:22,885 --> 00:54:25,844
She's a conniving, vicious
little two-faced brat.

677
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:27,637
Just smile, pet.

678
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:35,061
Think of California and that wonderful
community property law, and just smile.

679
00:54:35,731 --> 00:54:38,018
- Hi.
- Hello, Mitch, darling.

680
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:43,149
- Hi, Edna.
- Who is this ecstatic, bright-eyed child?

681
00:54:43,572 --> 00:54:45,905
- Oh, Mitch, this couldn't be...
- Sure. That's Susie.

682
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:48,153
Honey, this is Vicky's mother,
Mrs. Robinson.

683
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:50,781
- How do you do?
- This angelic girl?

684
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:55,366
- This is the one you call Peanut Face?
- Oh, Daddy, really!

685
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:58,876
Now you come right over here
to your Auntie Edna

686
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:01,704
and you and I are gonna
get to know one another.

687
00:55:02,591 --> 00:55:06,050
Come on, I want to hear all about you.
Down you go.

688
00:55:07,054 --> 00:55:08,886
- Hi.
- Did you tell her?

689
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:12,758
Well, I started to,
then I don't know what happened.

690
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:13,966
Oh, Mitch. For...

691
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:17,137
All right, just let me do it
in my own way. All right?

692
00:55:17,356 --> 00:55:19,268
Now, it's all settled.

693
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:23,731
Susan and I have decided we're all gonna
have a jolly lunch right here.

694
00:55:24,822 --> 00:55:27,030
Oh, Edna, I'm sorry,
I don't think we can today.

695
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:29,111
See, I promised to spend
the whole day with Susie

696
00:55:29,368 --> 00:55:30,984
and we've got some stuff planned,
you know?

697
00:55:31,537 --> 00:55:36,202
- Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
- Oh, that's all right. Another time, dear.

698
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:39,124
You're an adorable thing.

699
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:41,877
Come on, Susie, we'll get the horses.
We're gonna take a ride down the beach.

700
00:55:42,089 --> 00:55:43,921
- Have fun.
- Bye, darling.

701
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:47,083
First change I make in that household,

702
00:55:47,261 --> 00:55:50,095
off she goes to a boarding school
in Switzerland.

703
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:21,079
Honey, listen, I've been meaning
to ask you. What do you think of Vicky?

704
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:23,745
Uh, in what respect?

705
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:28,712
Well... it's just an ordinary question.

706
00:56:29,011 --> 00:56:32,630
No, it's not.
You asked me what I think of Vicky.

707
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:35,264
Well, what do I think of Vicky as what?

708
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:39,678
I mean, if you asked me what
do I think of her as a fashion model

709
00:56:39,897 --> 00:56:42,355
or a famous aviatrix or something

710
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:46,894
then maybe I can express
some sort of opinion, but just to ask...

711
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:53,109
All right.
What do you think of Vicky as a person?

712
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:56,786
Well, Daddy,
I really couldn't say.

713
00:56:57,623 --> 00:56:59,535
She's a perfect stranger to me.

714
00:57:00,292 --> 00:57:02,875
- Race you back to the house!
- Wait a minute, Susie. Susie!

715
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:04,918
Hey! I'm not through talking to you!

716
00:57:23,315 --> 00:57:24,681
Hi, darling.

717
00:57:25,484 --> 00:57:26,941
- Hi.
- Hello, sweetie.

718
00:57:33,533 --> 00:57:35,069
He can't. He just can't.

719
00:57:36,078 --> 00:57:37,694
Oh, it makes me so mad.

720
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:40,446
A man of his age.

721
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:43,453
All our work and our plans.

722
00:57:47,965 --> 00:57:49,081
Hi.

723
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:58,555
You used to confide in me.

724
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:03,469
Anything you want to talk over with me?

725
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:05,308
No.

726
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:09,938
You wouldn't like to tell me why
Andromeda never comes near you?

727
00:58:12,531 --> 00:58:15,274
Or why suddenly your appetite's changed?

728
00:58:16,994 --> 00:58:19,156
Dear Verbena, you are a mystic.

729
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:22,155
Mystic? I'm no mystic.

730
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:25,663
Well, asking me all these crazy questions.

731
00:58:26,086 --> 00:58:27,702
Gee, I don't know what you're getting at.

732
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:34,041
You know what I'm talking about.

733
00:58:35,303 --> 00:58:37,920
There's something very strange about you.

734
00:58:39,266 --> 00:58:41,929
Are you sure there isn't anything
you want to tell me?

735
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:45,598
What do you want me to tell you?

736
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:49,849
I don't know.
It's almost as if you were...

737
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:55,355
- Oh, that's impossible.
- Almost as if I were who, Verbena?

738
00:58:56,575 --> 00:58:58,567
Oh, forget it, honey. Never mind.

739
00:59:00,328 --> 00:59:01,364
You mean Sharon?

740
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:13,039
Where did you hear about her?

741
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:17,051
Oh, Verbena.

742
00:59:19,473 --> 00:59:23,467
I've got to tell someone, but you've got
to swear never to tell Daddy.

743
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:25,308
Promise?

744
00:59:26,146 --> 00:59:28,638
- Now, darling, try to be diplomatic...
- Honey, I know how to talk

745
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:30,056
- to my own daughter.
- ...Handle her calmly.

746
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:32,858
She's 14 years old.
She's not exactly insensitive.

747
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:34,151
Good luck...

748
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:38,401
Susan?

749
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:43,119
Oh, hi, Dad. Just getting back?

750
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:45,788
Uh-huh. Just a minute.
I want to talk to you.

751
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:47,956
Didn't know what a good thing you had
when you had it.

752
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:51,118
Susie!

753
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:57,424
Well, why did you go running off

754
00:59:57,636 --> 00:59:59,548
like that?
I told you I want to talk to you

755
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:01,257
- about something.
- I'm listening.

756
01:00:04,476 --> 01:00:07,685
- Get comfortable.
- I am comfortable.

757
01:00:08,188 --> 01:00:09,349
What do you want?

758
01:00:10,899 --> 01:00:13,562
Well, first of all, honey, about me.
Now...

759
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:17,900
Well, you probably think of me as being
just your father and to you

760
01:00:18,073 --> 01:00:20,156
I probably seem ancient and old...

761
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:23,283
- Not ancient, Daddy.
- Well, certainly not.

762
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:24,660
I'm in my best years.

763
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:26,863
OK.

764
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:29,498
- Don't get nervous.
- Well, I'm not nervous.

765
01:00:30,669 --> 01:00:34,083
Now see, what seems old to you now
isn't really old when you get old...

766
01:00:34,548 --> 01:00:36,039
I mean, when you get older.

767
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:39,258
That is when you get to be my age
it won't seem old to you at all

768
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:40,960
and you'll probably...

769
01:00:42,556 --> 01:00:44,513
Where did you learn
how to play the piano?

770
01:00:45,976 --> 01:00:47,057
Oh.

771
01:00:47,269 --> 01:00:51,809
- They taught us at camp.
- Gee. That's awfully good in five weeks.

772
01:00:53,775 --> 01:00:55,937
Could you stop now for just a minute,
please?

773
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:58,106
- Yeah, sure.
- Pay attention.

774
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:02,402
See, I've been wanting
to have this little talk with you about...

775
01:01:04,035 --> 01:01:08,871
What would you think about our making
Vicky, part of our family?

776
01:01:09,958 --> 01:01:11,369
- Part of our family?
- Uh-huh.

777
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:12,829
Um...

778
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:15,787
- Oh, I think that's a wonderful idea.
- You do?

779
01:01:16,006 --> 01:01:19,590
Well, I most certainly do.
I've always wanted to have a sister.

780
01:01:21,428 --> 01:01:24,216
No, no, honey.
See, you're missing the whole point.

781
01:01:24,431 --> 01:01:26,889
And how sweet of you
to want to adopt Vicky.

782
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:30,343
No, baby. I don't want to adopt her.

783
01:01:31,062 --> 01:01:32,348
I want to marry her.

784
01:01:33,398 --> 01:01:36,732
Marry her? Oh, Dad!

785
01:01:37,277 --> 01:01:39,143
You've just got to be kidding!

786
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:44,736
You can't marry her. She's just a child.

787
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:46,237
She's not a child, she's a woman!

788
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:48,448
Will you please stop referring
to her as a child?

789
01:01:48,622 --> 01:01:50,784
It's all relative, Dad. Don't you see?

790
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:54,617
- Compared to her, you're an old man.
- I am not an old man!

791
01:01:54,836 --> 01:01:57,874
- You are too! It's absolutely revolting!
- Revolting!

792
01:01:58,048 --> 01:01:59,914
It's the most revolting thing
I ever heard of!

793
01:02:00,008 --> 01:02:02,000
- I'm not at your age...
- I'm not even gonna discuss it with you

794
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:03,842
- if you don't stop shouting.
- But Dad, you just said...

795
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:05,006
Just stop it.

796
01:02:09,476 --> 01:02:12,719
All right. I'm not screaming.

797
01:02:14,105 --> 01:02:18,270
I will talk about this
perfectly calmly and rationally.

798
01:02:19,319 --> 01:02:21,857
You can't get married!
You'll ruin everything!

799
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:24,652
All the plans we've made!
The work and the...

800
01:02:24,824 --> 01:02:26,406
- What are you talking about?
- ...and the diagrams.

801
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:29,819
And my hair! Look at my hair!
I cut it just for you.

802
01:02:30,205 --> 01:02:33,039
And my fingernails, I've bitten them
all off just because of you!

803
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:35,165
Of all the pig-headed fathers!

804
01:02:36,294 --> 01:02:40,880
All those days and weeks and weeks,
nothing but work... and...

805
01:02:41,174 --> 01:02:43,666
And voice and names and hair... Oh!

806
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:46,551
I dunno what's the matter with her.
I tried to talk to her.

807
01:02:46,638 --> 01:02:48,971
And she gets hysterical.
She's not even making any sense now.

808
01:02:49,516 --> 01:02:52,475
Let me speak to her for a minute, darling.
Women understand these things better.

809
01:02:52,727 --> 01:02:54,138
Make yourself scarce.

810
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:05,775
Hello, darling.

811
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:08,903
He's making an absolute ninny of himself.

812
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:11,785
Oh, it came as quite a shock to you
the way he told you, didn't it?

813
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:14,280
Men put things so badly.

814
01:03:16,126 --> 01:03:19,460
Can't you and I discuss this calmly
and rationally together like

815
01:03:19,879 --> 01:03:21,165
like grown-up women?

816
01:03:21,381 --> 01:03:22,997
Oh, I'm sure we can.

817
01:03:24,134 --> 01:03:26,376
You're not afraid to come over here
and talk to me, are you?

818
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:28,423
I'm not afraid to talk to anybody.

819
01:03:32,726 --> 01:03:34,137
You're a big girl now, Susan.

820
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:36,810
You're old enough to understand
that wonderful, delicate mystery

821
01:03:37,022 --> 01:03:39,139
that happens sometimes
between a man and woman.

822
01:03:39,441 --> 01:03:42,434
I know what wonderful, delicate mystery
Daddy sees in you...

823
01:03:44,279 --> 01:03:48,319
and I can't say I blame him there either.
You're very nicely put together.

824
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:54,612
Your father underestimates you, I think.

825
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:57,706
I'm sure you won't, will you, Vicky?

826
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:04,881
Susan, dear, you've had him
to yourself all this time

827
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:07,424
and I can understand that suddenly
to have another woman around,

828
01:04:08,178 --> 01:04:10,010
well, it's a tremendous intrusion.

829
01:04:10,430 --> 01:04:14,515
But all my life it seemed, I've hoped
and waited for someone like him,

830
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:18,803
someone gentle and mature,
rough-edged, but quick to laugh,

831
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:21,559
someone understanding and wise.

832
01:04:22,317 --> 01:04:24,730
All the things that I've come
to love and cherish in him.

833
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:28,904
- Well, that's very refreshing.
- Why, dear?

834
01:04:30,033 --> 01:04:33,242
Most girls just run after Daddy
because he's so wealthy.

835
01:04:37,499 --> 01:04:39,707
Are you inferring that I'd marry
your father for his money?

836
01:04:40,085 --> 01:04:41,747
If the shoe fits, wear it.

837
01:04:44,839 --> 01:04:45,829
Look, pet.

838
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:48,749
I've tried to be friendly,
but I'm going to marry your father,

839
01:04:48,968 --> 01:04:50,800
so, you get used to the idea.

840
01:04:51,179 --> 01:04:52,260
You wanna bet?

841
01:04:54,307 --> 01:04:57,050
Oh, honey, don't you play
with the big girls.

842
01:04:57,268 --> 01:04:59,055
You'll be in way over your head.

843
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:16,277
<i>Operator.</i>

844
01:05:16,871 --> 01:05:18,578
Get me Western Union, please.

845
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:25,870
For Sharon?
A child of her age getting a telegram?

846
01:05:26,131 --> 01:05:29,044
Well, don't stand there, daughter.
Let her read it. It belongs to her.

847
01:05:29,342 --> 01:05:32,176
But who would possibly
be sending her a telegram?

848
01:05:52,198 --> 01:05:53,188
Sharon?

849
01:05:58,496 --> 01:06:02,456
"Alexander Graham. 3 a.m."

850
01:06:03,668 --> 01:06:04,749
California.

851
01:06:05,753 --> 01:06:08,336
Who could she possibly know
in California?

852
01:06:09,466 --> 01:06:14,131
Uh, Bertha Waterbury.
This girl I met at camp. Sensational girl.

853
01:06:14,929 --> 01:06:17,888
It's a rather cryptic message.
What does it mean?

854
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:23,727
Well, she's crazy about this boy,
Alexander.

855
01:06:24,856 --> 01:06:27,690
And he took her
on a very important date till 3 a.m.

856
01:06:28,485 --> 01:06:31,569
I've never heard of such a thing.
A child of that age!

857
01:06:31,779 --> 01:06:34,772
- Now, Mother, please don't make an issue.
- We're living in the modern age.

858
01:06:42,957 --> 01:06:44,493
Hello?

859
01:06:44,709 --> 01:06:46,666
<i>- Miss Susan Evers?</i>
- Yes, speaking.

860
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:49,078
<i>- Go ahead, please.</i>
- It's me again.

861
01:06:49,297 --> 01:06:53,086
I know, boy, did I have a time explaining
your telegram, cuckoo pig.

862
01:06:53,426 --> 01:06:55,884
Grandmother went into a five-minute
lecture on raising children.

863
01:06:56,429 --> 01:06:59,843
What's wrong now?
Look I told you what you ought to do.

864
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:02,174
You've got to believe me,
it's an emergency.

865
01:07:02,352 --> 01:07:05,641
- I'm in just horrible trouble out here.
- Now, don't dramatize it.

866
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:07,346
I'm not, stupid. This time it's serious.

867
01:07:07,649 --> 01:07:09,060
<i>It's the worst thing
that could happen.</i>

868
01:07:09,192 --> 01:07:10,308
<i>You mean it's gone that far?</i>

869
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:12,435
And at a time like this
I think Mother ought to be here.

870
01:07:12,612 --> 01:07:15,571
OK. Tomorrow morning I'll break the bomb.
See you soon.

871
01:07:15,823 --> 01:07:17,030
- How's Mother?
- Fine.

872
01:07:17,492 --> 01:07:19,700
- Kiss her for me, and Grandpa.
- OK. Bye.

873
01:07:35,301 --> 01:07:36,337
Oh!

874
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:40,304
- Hi, Grandpa.
- Hi, Susan.

875
01:07:42,016 --> 01:07:44,099
- Susan?
- Yes.

876
01:07:44,811 --> 01:07:46,222
Sit down. Sit down.

877
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:52,141
I think you and I ought to have
a little chat, don't you?

878
01:07:57,365 --> 01:08:01,200
Oh, we've got the Picasso exhibition
at four o'clock, Margaret.

879
01:08:01,327 --> 01:08:02,659
- We don't want to miss that.
- I know.

880
01:08:02,829 --> 01:08:04,946
- Are you coming, Charles?
- No, thank you.

881
01:08:05,206 --> 01:08:07,448
Then we should get out
in time for Mrs. Saunders' tea.

882
01:08:07,667 --> 01:08:09,875
- Oh, Caroline's daughter's coming.
- Oh, really?

883
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:13,830
Oh, now, Sharon, you've got
your dancing lesson at 10:30.

884
01:08:14,173 --> 01:08:16,916
Then you can go straight on
to the musical appreciation

885
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:18,209
at the Leonardo Hall.

886
01:08:18,803 --> 01:08:21,090
Oh, Staimes could drive her in your car,
Charles?

887
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:22,713
Yes. Yes. That'd be...

888
01:08:23,016 --> 01:08:24,678
- Do it now.
- Now, at three o'clock...

889
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:26,884
I don't think I'll be able
to do any of those today.

890
01:08:27,687 --> 01:08:29,019
What did you say?

891
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:31,893
Sharon. You interrupted your grandmother.

892
01:08:32,191 --> 01:08:34,353
Well, I have something important
to tell you.

893
01:08:35,194 --> 01:08:39,689
Mother, Mother, I think what you
and Daddy did to us children is lousy!

894
01:08:40,033 --> 01:08:43,276
- In fact, I think it stinks!
- Sharon!

895
01:08:44,078 --> 01:08:46,821
And let's get this straight.
I'm not Sharon, I'm Susan.

896
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:49,998
Sharon, your Sharon, is
out in California with Daddy.

897
01:08:50,251 --> 01:08:52,618
- But it's impossible.
- You can't be Susan.

898
01:08:52,837 --> 01:08:55,830
But I am Susan!
Sharon and I met at camp.

899
01:08:56,299 --> 01:08:57,961
So we decided to switch places.

900
01:08:58,343 --> 01:09:01,962
She bit off her fingernails and I cut
her hair, and now she's out in California

901
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:05,427
with Dad, swimming and riding my horse,
and having a keen time,

902
01:09:05,725 --> 01:09:09,014
and I'm stuck here with these
lousy music lessons, and I hate them!

903
01:09:10,021 --> 01:09:11,137
Susan.

904
01:09:13,274 --> 01:09:14,731
I'm sorry, Mother.

905
01:09:16,694 --> 01:09:20,734
But I wanted to see you,
and I miss not having a mother.

906
01:09:22,825 --> 01:09:28,662
I love you very much and I wondered...
if you could love me as me

907
01:09:28,873 --> 01:09:31,991
and not as Sharon, please?

908
01:09:33,461 --> 01:09:35,077
Oh, Susan.

909
01:09:39,467 --> 01:09:42,881
Oh, my darling.
Why didn't you let me know?

910
01:09:43,638 --> 01:09:46,130
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I couldn't help it.

911
01:09:46,933 --> 01:09:49,801
I wanted to be near you
and to know what it was like

912
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:51,555
to have a mother and everything.

913
01:09:53,731 --> 01:09:55,017
Oh, my baby.

914
01:09:56,609 --> 01:10:01,229
Susan, darling! Oh, dear.
Let me look at you.

915
01:10:01,447 --> 01:10:03,655
- She's exactly like Sharon.
- I know. I can't believe it.

916
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:05,482
- Oh, baby, all these years...
- Louise?

917
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:07,276
- What is it?
- Isn't it wonderful?

918
01:10:07,537 --> 01:10:09,403
- Oh, darling.
- You know we talked about this

919
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:11,204
- Louise.
- ...at camp and we decided it'd be

920
01:10:11,374 --> 01:10:12,990
- the best thing.
- What is it, Charles?

921
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:14,575
It's most important.

922
01:10:19,424 --> 01:10:21,666
Well? What is it?

923
01:10:21,801 --> 01:10:24,293
I just thought they ought to be alone
for a minute, that's all.

924
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:26,507
- Is that all?
- She's Margaret's child.

925
01:10:26,681 --> 01:10:28,764
She hasn't seen her
since she was one year old.

926
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:31,012
But I'm her grandmother!
I have a right to...

927
01:10:31,185 --> 01:10:34,269
Louise, for once I'm putting my foot down.

928
01:10:35,022 --> 01:10:37,059
Let them alone.

929
01:10:38,985 --> 01:10:42,569
I've tried, Mother, honestly I have,
but I just don't understand.

930
01:10:43,573 --> 01:10:46,236
Darling, it doesn't mean your father
and I didn't love each other,

931
01:10:46,617 --> 01:10:49,576
but sometimes even when people think
a lot about each other,

932
01:10:49,746 --> 01:10:51,954
they sometimes just don't get on together.

933
01:10:52,623 --> 01:10:54,615
So you're gonna have
to switch us back again, huh?

934
01:10:55,293 --> 01:11:00,004
Well, legally, you belong to your father
and Sharon belongs to me.

935
01:11:01,174 --> 01:11:05,009
His and hers.
Makes me feel like a bathroom towel.

936
01:11:06,971 --> 01:11:08,337
It's lousy, isn't it?

937
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:11,223
But don't worry. We'll find a way.

938
01:11:12,435 --> 01:11:14,927
Six months split.
That's how it's going to end up.

939
01:11:15,146 --> 01:11:16,182
What?

940
01:11:16,397 --> 01:11:19,105
Oh, a lot of kids in camp have
that problem too.

941
01:11:19,358 --> 01:11:23,898
Six months with one parent, six months
with the other like a yo-yo.

942
01:11:24,322 --> 01:11:26,780
I don't like it any more
than you do, darling.

943
01:11:27,825 --> 01:11:31,284
But don't worry,
I'm not going to lose you now.

944
01:11:34,457 --> 01:11:37,666
- Bettina, would you put this in your case?
- Yes, ma'am.

945
01:11:37,835 --> 01:11:39,497
- May I come in?
- Of course, Dad.

946
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:43,505
- I have you and Susan on the noon plane.
- That doesn't give us very much time.

947
01:11:43,758 --> 01:11:46,671
- Well, best I can do on short notice.
- Well, thank you.

948
01:11:47,011 --> 01:11:48,627
Traffic's pretty heavy these days.

949
01:11:50,181 --> 01:11:54,846
Are you, uh... are you wearing
that dress on the trip, are you?

950
01:11:55,102 --> 01:11:57,685
- What's wrong with it?
- Oh, it's very nice. Very nice.

951
01:11:58,898 --> 01:12:00,730
Give my best to Mitch
when you see him, will you.

952
01:12:01,734 --> 01:12:05,648
- I wonder what kind of a wife he has now.
- Who said he's married?

953
01:12:05,863 --> 01:12:11,234
Well, a vital, romantic fellow like Mitch,
it's a cinch he'd find a nice young wife.

954
01:12:11,452 --> 01:12:14,365
Well, I certainly hope that she likes
to sleep in the great outdoors

955
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:17,243
- and scale fish.
- Now, no sour grapes now.

956
01:12:17,542 --> 01:12:20,330
Oh, Bettina, would you see
if you can find my blue skirt?

957
01:12:20,503 --> 01:12:21,584
Yes, ma'am.

958
01:12:21,921 --> 01:12:24,755
You know, Margaret, I've got to hand
it to you for one thing.

959
01:12:24,924 --> 01:12:26,335
I've got to give you credit.

960
01:12:26,676 --> 01:12:29,009
It certainly shows strength of character

961
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:32,304
not to go with the new fashion trends
in clothes.

962
01:12:32,807 --> 01:12:35,550
All right, Dad.
Now, what are you trying to get at?

963
01:12:35,768 --> 01:12:38,101
No, no. I'm just... You know,
I'm just saying that...

964
01:12:38,813 --> 01:12:41,271
- You take your hairstyle, for instance...
- What's wrong with my hair?

965
01:12:41,482 --> 01:12:42,723
That's what I mean.

966
01:12:42,942 --> 01:12:45,150
Women nowadays, they're wearing
their hair a little differently.

967
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:47,148
That's all.
You know, a little fuller, maybe.

968
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:49,104
All right, Dad.
Are you looking for a fight?

969
01:12:49,323 --> 01:12:51,531
With my favorite daughter?
Not on your life.

970
01:12:51,742 --> 01:12:54,450
Now, don't get me wrong.
My goodness.

971
01:12:54,871 --> 01:12:57,079
Well, you know, you are what you are.

972
01:12:57,498 --> 01:13:00,241
And I, God love you.
I wouldn't wanna change you for the world.

973
01:13:00,459 --> 01:13:02,371
- Not for the world.
- Who said anything about changing?

974
01:13:02,587 --> 01:13:04,749
That's what I say. Stay the way you are.

975
01:13:04,964 --> 01:13:06,375
Well, I certainly intend to.

976
01:13:06,591 --> 01:13:10,005
A nice, reliable, settled,
comfortable woman,

977
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:13,678
who accepts the coming of age
with grace and dignity.

978
01:13:14,098 --> 01:13:18,138
Why, that's the most horrible thing
that anybody could possibly say!

979
01:13:18,352 --> 01:13:20,218
There you are, you see?
You're flying off the handle.

980
01:13:20,521 --> 01:13:24,356
And all I came in here for was to kiss you
goodbye and wish you good luck.

981
01:13:26,777 --> 01:13:28,234
Goodbye, daughter.

982
01:13:28,821 --> 01:13:30,062
Goodbye.

983
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:31,988
Give my regards to Mitch, huh?

984
01:13:32,992 --> 01:13:36,360
You know, come to think of it,
that dress seems just perfect for you.

985
01:13:50,384 --> 01:13:53,252
Hi, Mother. I'm all packed.
What time do we go?

986
01:13:53,471 --> 01:13:55,588
On the noon plane,
and we haven't got very much time.

987
01:13:55,806 --> 01:13:57,593
Have you got everything
in that we wanted for Sharon?

988
01:13:57,808 --> 01:14:00,642
- Mm-hm.
- Um...

989
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:03,637
How would you like to stop over
in New York for a few days?

990
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:05,806
Oh, yeah! Why?

991
01:14:06,025 --> 01:14:09,143
I thought that we might do some
shopping before we head west.

992
01:14:13,032 --> 01:14:15,319
Hey, we got a nice little calf there,
Mitch.

993
01:14:23,334 --> 01:14:24,666
What's eating you?

994
01:14:26,003 --> 01:14:28,495
You ever get that funny feeling
like something's gonna happen?

995
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:30,622
Like a storm brewing?

996
01:14:32,426 --> 01:14:33,712
No. Come on.

997
01:14:46,148 --> 01:14:47,184
Verbena!

998
01:14:48,567 --> 01:14:51,150
Verbena, we're here! Sharon!

999
01:14:52,613 --> 01:14:54,980
Verbena, we're here!

1000
01:14:55,658 --> 01:14:57,399
Come on, Mother.
Shall I help you with your...

1001
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:00,573
- Oh, darling!
- Verbena.

1002
01:15:02,123 --> 01:15:07,118
Mrs. Evers! You just look wonderful.
Let me take your things.

1003
01:15:07,378 --> 01:15:11,964
- I'll take them inside. Hello, darling!
- Verbena. How are you?

1004
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:15,633
- I'm fine, but, oh, we've missed you.
- How's Andromeda and Schotzli?

1005
01:15:17,013 --> 01:15:19,756
- Thank you very much. Keep the change.
- Thank you.

1006
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:23,224
Oh, I can't wait to get you
inside and show you how lovely

1007
01:15:23,436 --> 01:15:24,677
everything is here now.

1008
01:15:26,564 --> 01:15:28,521
- Oh, it was just wonderful.
- All's well, fine.

1009
01:15:28,691 --> 01:15:32,184
- Absolutely... Sharon!
- Mother! I'm so glad you came!

1010
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:36,438
Oh, you look wonderful!
What did you do to yourself?

1011
01:15:37,116 --> 01:15:39,199
- Do you like it?
- Oh, I love it.

1012
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:41,151
Oh, darling.

1013
01:15:41,579 --> 01:15:43,195
Oh...

1014
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:46,783
Finally, both of you together at last.

1015
01:15:47,835 --> 01:15:49,952
- What do you think of each other?
- Fine.

1016
01:15:50,504 --> 01:15:51,961
We love each other.

1017
01:15:52,298 --> 01:15:53,914
- Hi, Sue.
- Hi.

1018
01:15:56,594 --> 01:16:02,465
- Oh and just look at you. That short hair.
- I cut it, Mother.

1019
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:06,684
- You know, I like it!
- Oh and I love yours, Mother.

1020
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:10,223
- Where's your father?
- Oh, he's out somewhere on a horse.

1021
01:16:11,192 --> 01:16:13,559
- Are we in time?
- Time?

1022
01:16:14,361 --> 01:16:15,351
Didn't you tell her?

1023
01:16:17,448 --> 01:16:19,940
- Tell me what?
- Well...

1024
01:16:22,203 --> 01:16:23,569
Dad's getting married.

1025
01:16:26,707 --> 01:16:28,073
Well...

1026
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:33,954
- When is all this taking place?
- Saturday, supposedly.

1027
01:16:38,427 --> 01:16:43,218
She just sort of infiltrated, Mother,
and before you knew it, Dad was hooked.

1028
01:16:43,641 --> 01:16:47,055
If you ask me, Mr. Evers is slipping
into his second childhood.

1029
01:16:47,228 --> 01:16:49,686
Oh, your father is old enough
to know what he's doing.

1030
01:16:50,356 --> 01:16:51,722
Shall we go upstairs and get unpacked?

1031
01:16:51,899 --> 01:16:55,313
I'm just dying to get into a hot shower
after that long train trip.

1032
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:03,817
- You want a beer?
- Yeah. I'll be in in a minute.

1033
01:17:04,745 --> 01:17:08,034
You know I don't say a word,
not a single word,

1034
01:17:08,207 --> 01:17:11,075
but the things
that Vicky woman has been up to...

1035
01:17:11,252 --> 01:17:13,164
- Really?
- Oh, well...

1036
01:17:14,004 --> 01:17:17,463
- Hi, Dad.
- Oh. Well, hi.

1037
01:17:18,134 --> 01:17:21,468
- Look who's talking to me.
- Why shouldn't I talk to you?

1038
01:17:22,012 --> 01:17:26,256
Oh, come on, I can get married anytime
I want to, you got that?

1039
01:17:26,976 --> 01:17:28,217
- Yeah.
- Now, don't stand there and pretend

1040
01:17:28,394 --> 01:17:30,386
you don't know what I'm talking about
after you've been walking around

1041
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:31,845
the house like a mummy for two days.

1042
01:17:32,439 --> 01:17:34,396
Yes. You, me, two days. Nothing!

1043
01:17:35,609 --> 01:17:36,770
- Oh.
- Remember?

1044
01:17:38,112 --> 01:17:39,569
Oh, yeah. You were...

1045
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:44,073
I guess I have been acting
sort of sulky lately.

1046
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:48,279
Sulky? Ha.
That's the understatement of the year.

1047
01:17:49,999 --> 01:17:52,662
Sulky? You haven't been sulky,
you've been plain impossible.

1048
01:17:52,877 --> 01:17:55,870
You've been monstrous!
Now, pouting is childish.

1049
01:17:56,046 --> 01:17:58,208
You're much too old for that
and not speaking to someone

1050
01:17:58,465 --> 01:18:01,583
because you're mad at them
is just plain... It's...

1051
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:04,503
- Feminine.
- Yes. Feminine, and she's absolutely right

1052
01:18:04,805 --> 01:18:06,797
and it's the worst part
of being feminine too.

1053
01:18:09,935 --> 01:18:11,551
The doorbell's ringing.

1054
01:18:13,105 --> 01:18:16,143
Oh, listen now.
That's the minister and Miss Robinson.

1055
01:18:16,358 --> 01:18:17,974
And you're to be polite to them,
you understand?

1056
01:18:18,402 --> 01:18:19,563
Here. Here.

1057
01:18:20,571 --> 01:18:21,778
Come here.

1058
01:18:30,748 --> 01:18:33,081
- Well, hello.
- Hello, Mitch darling.

1059
01:18:34,251 --> 01:18:36,243
Mitchell, I want you
to meet Dr. Mosby.

1060
01:18:36,462 --> 01:18:39,330
- Dr. Mosby, Mitchell Evers, the groom.
- How do you do, sir?

1061
01:18:39,632 --> 01:18:45,094
Oh, how beautiful! Isn't this lovely?
So masculine.

1062
01:18:45,262 --> 01:18:48,096
- Mitch, it needs a woman's touch.
- Sure.

1063
01:18:48,515 --> 01:18:51,679
There's that angelic creature again.

1064
01:18:51,936 --> 01:18:55,896
- Hello, Susan. How are you today?
- Fine, thank you.

1065
01:18:56,523 --> 01:18:57,764
This is the Reverend Mosby, dear.

1066
01:18:57,983 --> 01:18:59,724
He's going to conduct
the marriage ceremony.

1067
01:19:00,110 --> 01:19:02,397
- How do you do?
- How do you do, my dear?

1068
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:03,862
Listen, I've gotta go up and change.

1069
01:19:03,989 --> 01:19:05,355
Will you excuse me for just
a minute, please?

1070
01:19:05,574 --> 01:19:06,815
Oh, certainly.

1071
01:19:07,868 --> 01:19:10,906
Say, how'd you like to be hostess
for a few minutes, huh?

1072
01:19:12,122 --> 01:19:13,579
And be polite.

1073
01:19:30,391 --> 01:19:32,132
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, honey.

1074
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:33,933
There are some people downstairs.
Did you know?

1075
01:19:34,144 --> 01:19:36,181
Yeah, I know.

1076
01:20:29,742 --> 01:20:33,736
Your grandfather sends his love.
Your grandmother does too, and she's fine.

1077
01:20:33,954 --> 01:20:35,820
- She's downstairs. Do you wanna see her?
- Who, Vicky?

1078
01:20:36,457 --> 01:20:39,541
- No, thanks. I've seen her.
- Well, I haven't.

1079
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:51,378
- Susie...
- Did you want something, Daddy?

1080
01:20:53,766 --> 01:20:55,473
No, honey. Never mind.

1081
01:21:02,733 --> 01:21:04,770
Mother, this is my wedding.
You've had four.

1082
01:21:04,985 --> 01:21:07,102
- Why didn't you mix some drinks, Vicky?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1083
01:21:07,279 --> 01:21:08,520
- We were waiting for you.
- Oh, that's silly.

1084
01:21:08,697 --> 01:21:11,280
- Let's have a little something. Good.
- Oh, anything you have.

1085
01:21:11,492 --> 01:21:15,202
- The usual, darling.
- Reverend, I don't suppose you indulge?

1086
01:21:15,621 --> 01:21:20,332
Oh, well, perhaps a little something
by way of a nuptial toast.

1087
01:21:20,584 --> 01:21:21,995
Good.

1088
01:21:22,878 --> 01:21:25,962
Bourbon, double, on the rocks.

1089
01:21:28,592 --> 01:21:29,708
Yes, sir.

1090
01:21:29,927 --> 01:21:31,919
Vicky, I know this is your wedding,

1091
01:21:32,179 --> 01:21:35,843
but think how an outdoor ceremony
will look in the newspapers.

1092
01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:38,763
I'm inclined to agree with you,
Mrs. Robinson.

1093
01:21:39,019 --> 01:21:44,185
You know, the Marco-Dennisons had
their wedding under a striped awning tent.

1094
01:21:44,691 --> 01:21:49,186
Last month it was and the atmosphere was
ideally apropos,

1095
01:21:49,822 --> 01:21:54,442
there in God's natural setting
under the trees. Thank you.

1096
01:22:08,549 --> 01:22:09,756
Thank you.

1097
01:22:18,976 --> 01:22:22,765
- Oh, Mitch!
- Upsidaisy, darling.

1098
01:22:29,069 --> 01:22:31,777
Edna, listen, I think your idea
about having the wedding

1099
01:22:31,947 --> 01:22:34,314
outside is wonderful.

1100
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:40,111
Sure, I'd like to start
from the house.

1101
01:22:40,706 --> 01:22:42,242
Vicky can come down the walk...

1102
01:22:42,458 --> 01:22:45,701
Now, Dr. Mosby and I could be right here.
We could put lights out on the lake.

1103
01:22:46,253 --> 01:22:48,085
- Mother, please.
- Nothing could be more...

1104
01:22:48,297 --> 01:22:50,380
We'll put the marquees over here.

1105
01:22:51,091 --> 01:22:54,675
- Look at all those trees...
- ...under the trees over there...

1106
01:22:59,725 --> 01:23:02,809
- It's all right, I've got him.
- Grab hold of him! Grab him!

1107
01:23:04,605 --> 01:23:06,016
Here, give me your hand, quick.

1108
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:10,729
- Mitch darling!
- Yes. I'm all right.

1109
01:23:10,903 --> 01:23:12,439
How did you fall in?
Did you hurt yourself?

1110
01:23:12,613 --> 01:23:14,024
Yes, I'm all right!

1111
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:16,231
- I'll be back in just a minute.
- You don't need to shout.

1112
01:23:16,408 --> 01:23:18,866
I was hoping to get out of these clothes.
Wait...

1113
01:23:44,144 --> 01:23:46,386
- Mitch.
- Maggie.

1114
01:23:47,940 --> 01:23:50,899
- How are you?
- Fine, thanks. How are you?

1115
01:23:51,401 --> 01:23:54,644
I'm fine. Gee, you look...

1116
01:23:55,489 --> 01:23:57,105
Look, I've got a flock of people
out there!

1117
01:23:57,366 --> 01:23:58,948
Don't start yelling.
Just let me explain.

1118
01:23:59,034 --> 01:24:00,866
- ...what you're doing here in...
- Keep quiet for one...

1119
01:24:02,412 --> 01:24:05,746
- If you just keep quiet, I'll tell you!
- You turn up... What are you doing here?

1120
01:24:05,999 --> 01:24:08,742
If you'll just stop screaming at her,
she'll explain, Dad.

1121
01:24:13,590 --> 01:24:14,876
Surprise.

1122
01:24:16,510 --> 01:24:18,422
That's what I was trying to tell you.

1123
01:24:21,306 --> 01:24:22,888
- Both of them?
- Mm-hm.

1124
01:24:36,863 --> 01:24:41,198
The two of them together. I can't...
Maggie, how did it happen?

1125
01:24:41,451 --> 01:24:44,944
We met at camp and then
the whole thing just sort of came out.

1126
01:24:47,249 --> 01:24:49,832
- They switched places on us.
- They what?

1127
01:24:50,877 --> 01:24:53,210
Sue came to Boston to be with me.

1128
01:24:55,924 --> 01:24:58,007
- You mean this is Sharon?
- Uh-huh.

1129
01:24:58,427 --> 01:25:02,216
I had Sharon all this time?
You're Sharon?

1130
01:25:02,973 --> 01:25:07,013
I wanted to know what you were like
and Susan wanted to meet Mother.

1131
01:25:09,229 --> 01:25:10,765
You are Sharon.

1132
01:25:14,359 --> 01:25:18,399
- You were only a tiny little baby...
- You're not mad, are you, Daddy?

1133
01:25:18,572 --> 01:25:21,690
No, no, sweetheart.
I just can't believe it's you, that's all.

1134
01:25:23,118 --> 01:25:25,360
Oh, my gosh.
The trouble I had burping you.

1135
01:25:25,537 --> 01:25:27,119
Oh, Daddy, really!

1136
01:25:27,581 --> 01:25:31,825
No, I mean it... I spent most of my nights
walking the floor up and down with you.

1137
01:25:32,044 --> 01:25:34,411
- Two o'clock feedings...
- And where was I?

1138
01:25:35,505 --> 01:25:37,417
Well, it was half and half.

1139
01:25:37,883 --> 01:25:40,717
Oh, you used up more diapers
than nearly ten kids.

1140
01:25:41,303 --> 01:25:43,966
- Daddy, diapers!
- Yes, diapers.

1141
01:25:44,765 --> 01:25:49,100
- Look at you now. Look at her.
- Quite grown up.

1142
01:25:52,230 --> 01:25:55,348
- And quite without a father.
- Aw, honey...

1143
01:25:56,026 --> 01:25:58,439
- And I'm quite without a mother.
- Sh.

1144
01:25:59,404 --> 01:26:04,365
Now, girls, we'll discuss this later on.
I want to talk to your father now.

1145
01:26:06,078 --> 01:26:08,161
Come on, Sharon. They want to be alone.

1146
01:26:13,627 --> 01:26:16,836
Daddy...
Daddy, please don't marry that woman.

1147
01:26:18,090 --> 01:26:20,582
All right, Sharon. Run along now.

1148
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:31,309
Will you look at that? I can't believe it.

1149
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:33,762
You know, the last time I saw them
together, they were that big

1150
01:26:33,897 --> 01:26:35,854
and you had them in that thing
and you were pushing them

1151
01:26:35,941 --> 01:26:37,682
through the park.

1152
01:26:38,568 --> 01:26:42,653
Oh, what a time for you to show up!
Just when I'm going to get married!

1153
01:26:42,906 --> 01:26:45,774
I didn't know, Mitch, honest.
Sharon told me when I got here.

1154
01:26:45,992 --> 01:26:50,783
- That girl is my fiancé.
- I know. I saw her.

1155
01:26:53,166 --> 01:26:55,874
All right. Let's have it.

1156
01:26:56,545 --> 01:27:00,710
- I think she's adorable.
- Sure you do.

1157
01:27:01,967 --> 01:27:05,802
- Except for what?
- I think she's a perfect dream.

1158
01:27:06,972 --> 01:27:10,932
Of course, her eyes are a little too close
together, but if you don't mind that.

1159
01:27:11,184 --> 01:27:14,768
Maggie, don't try those old, worn-out
tricks on me. They don't work anymore.

1160
01:27:15,063 --> 01:27:18,682
Now will you just go on upstairs
and put on something decent?

1161
01:27:19,151 --> 01:27:20,813
I'm perfectly decent.

1162
01:27:21,111 --> 01:27:23,194
Oh, sure. Running around in my bathrobe!

1163
01:27:23,822 --> 01:27:26,280
That looks great but she's liable to come
in here and see you in that thing.

1164
01:27:26,491 --> 01:27:28,198
- It looks like we just...
- Like we what?

1165
01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:31,903
You just go on upstairs
and put on some clothes, that's all!

1166
01:27:32,122 --> 01:27:35,160
Don't use that tone of voice with me.
We're not married anymore, remember?

1167
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:39,210
This is my house and you're not gonna go
running around dressed up in that thing...

1168
01:27:39,379 --> 01:27:42,622
I'll do anything that I darn well please,
and don't start ordering me around!

1169
01:27:42,841 --> 01:27:46,801
Maggie, I'm warning you for the last time.
Go on upstairs and put on some clothes...

1170
01:27:47,012 --> 01:27:51,473
Don't try force on me.
I lammed you once and I can do it...

1171
01:27:52,392 --> 01:27:54,099
- Now stand back.
- Maggie.

1172
01:27:54,895 --> 01:27:57,137
Don't... don't start that, will you?
Come on.

1173
01:27:57,522 --> 01:28:01,141
Mitch, take your hands off me.
Let me alone. I'm warning you.

1174
01:28:02,819 --> 01:28:04,355
- Oh... Oh...
- Ow!

1175
01:28:05,113 --> 01:28:08,948
- Did you have to do that?
- Oh, Mitch. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

1176
01:28:09,451 --> 01:28:11,534
Why do you have to get so physical?

1177
01:28:12,954 --> 01:28:16,368
I can't even talk to you about anything.
You always wind up belting me

1178
01:28:16,541 --> 01:28:18,703
with something.
That's the most vicious thing I ever...

1179
01:28:18,919 --> 01:28:22,583
- Oh, Mitch. It can't be that bad.
- It is too that bad. It hurts.

1180
01:28:22,839 --> 01:28:24,705
Let me see it.
Come on, now, I have to see it.

1181
01:28:24,925 --> 01:28:27,963
- Just leave it alone. You've done enough.
- Come on, help me. Open up. Let me see.

1182
01:28:28,303 --> 01:28:30,761
- Look, don't... Ow!
- Just a little bit.

1183
01:28:31,515 --> 01:28:35,805
Oh, Mitch, stop acting like a big baby.
I didn't get a good look at it. Come on.

1184
01:28:36,102 --> 01:28:38,014
- I want a doctor to look at it.
- Oh, don't be ridiculous.

1185
01:28:38,230 --> 01:28:40,187
- You're worse than the twins.
- Mr. Evers?

1186
01:28:40,524 --> 01:28:43,517
Mr. Evers, the ladies
were wondering... Excuse me.

1187
01:28:45,570 --> 01:28:47,186
- Oh.
- Reverend?

1188
01:28:49,241 --> 01:28:52,279
Wait just a minute, sir.
There's nothing wrong here.

1189
01:28:55,121 --> 01:28:57,784
There's nothing wrong at all.
It's not anything like you would think.

1190
01:28:57,958 --> 01:29:00,041
It's very easy to explain. You see, sir...

1191
01:29:00,502 --> 01:29:01,868
This is my wife.

1192
01:29:03,797 --> 01:29:04,913
Hello.

1193
01:29:05,090 --> 01:29:07,878
- How do you do, madam?
- How do you do?

1194
01:29:10,887 --> 01:29:14,255
- But what about...
- Oh, no. Ex-wife.

1195
01:29:15,016 --> 01:29:17,929
She came out here all of a sudden,
very unexpectedly.

1196
01:29:18,103 --> 01:29:20,937
to discuss some little mix-up
that we had about the children,

1197
01:29:21,147 --> 01:29:23,514
and while we were discussing it
I merely suggested

1198
01:29:23,692 --> 01:29:26,651
that she go upstairs and put
on something decent because you...

1199
01:29:27,279 --> 01:29:29,737
What am I telling you all this for?
It's none of your darn business.

1200
01:29:29,948 --> 01:29:32,281
Don't snap at him so.
He didn't ask for an explanation.

1201
01:29:32,450 --> 01:29:36,740
You're the one who's babbling on
as if there were something to hide.

1202
01:29:37,706 --> 01:29:41,245
Dr. Mosby isn't at all shocked
at seeing me like this, are you?

1203
01:29:41,459 --> 01:29:42,745
Of course he's shocked.
What do you expect?

1204
01:29:42,961 --> 01:29:44,827
He walks in here, you're running around
in that get-up...

1205
01:29:45,046 --> 01:29:47,538
On the contrary, Mr. Evers,
I'm not at all shocked.

1206
01:29:47,716 --> 01:29:49,833
I see nothing wrong
with your wife's attire.

1207
01:29:50,135 --> 01:29:52,752
- Ex-wife.
- She's very beautiful, in fact.

1208
01:29:53,805 --> 01:29:54,966
Oh.

1209
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:58,553
You see, I knew I liked you.

1210
01:29:58,727 --> 01:30:01,970
Also, Mr. Evers, you'll find that
I'm not without a sense of humor.

1211
01:30:02,355 --> 01:30:05,063
I find this situation fraught with humor.

1212
01:30:05,817 --> 01:30:08,025
Quite out of the everyday, as we say.

1213
01:30:09,863 --> 01:30:12,571
Could you excuse us for just a moment,
Dr. Mosby?

1214
01:30:13,575 --> 01:30:15,817
Listen, Maggie, will you for once
in your life try to be

1215
01:30:15,994 --> 01:30:18,828
a little understanding, please?
I've got to go outside there

1216
01:30:19,039 --> 01:30:23,204
- and explain why you're here.
- That's not going to be easy.

1217
01:30:23,501 --> 01:30:27,165
- And I suppose they'll want to meet me.
- Well, I suppose that's natural.

1218
01:30:27,380 --> 01:30:29,963
Besides, I want to keep this thing
honest and above board.

1219
01:30:30,216 --> 01:30:32,333
Very well, then.
I'll just run upstairs

1220
01:30:32,510 --> 01:30:36,845
- and slip into something more comfortable.
- Ha-ha. Very funny.

1221
01:30:39,809 --> 01:30:43,143
- Oh, Dr. Mosby, don't you run away now.
- I'll be here.

1222
01:30:43,521 --> 01:30:46,184
- I'll be back in just a few minutes.
- I'll look forward to that.

1223
01:30:47,901 --> 01:30:50,985
A delightful woman, Mr. Evers.
However did you let her

1224
01:30:51,154 --> 01:30:54,443
slip away from you?
She's simply delightful.

1225
01:30:59,287 --> 01:31:01,279
Why couldn't she have
checked into a hotel?

1226
01:31:01,498 --> 01:31:03,160
I told you. I didn't invite her.

1227
01:31:03,375 --> 01:31:05,867
- I knew something would go wrong.
- Nothing has gone wrong.

1228
01:31:06,086 --> 01:31:08,499
- Nothing's gone wrong?
- She was home. She'd unpacked.

1229
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:11,460
- She's going to spend the night?
- Mitch, I won't have that!

1230
01:31:11,675 --> 01:31:13,712
Now, wait a minute.
You're reading implications into...

1231
01:31:22,102 --> 01:31:24,094
Wouldn't you like
to go out and look at the garden?

1232
01:31:24,312 --> 01:31:26,929
No, no, indeed.
I'm enjoying this immensely.

1233
01:31:27,148 --> 01:31:29,356
- You are?
- Very interesting situation.

1234
01:31:29,859 --> 01:31:31,896
Quite out of the everyday, you know.

1235
01:31:33,613 --> 01:31:34,854
Yes. It sure is.

1236
01:31:35,490 --> 01:31:39,234
Edna, listen, I guarantee you
by tomorrow morning, she'll be...

1237
01:31:39,369 --> 01:31:41,326
Mitch, I will not have her spending
the night in this house.

1238
01:31:41,454 --> 01:31:43,696
- You get rid of her. Do you hear me?
- Vicky, will you try to be

1239
01:31:43,915 --> 01:31:46,658
a little understanding?
She is not that kind of a woman.

1240
01:31:47,460 --> 01:31:49,577
She's a woman, that's enough.

1241
01:31:49,963 --> 01:31:54,003
Edna, she's not what you think at all.
In the first place, she's from Boston.

1242
01:31:55,051 --> 01:31:58,465
She's older, she's more mature.
She's had two children.

1243
01:31:58,638 --> 01:32:01,130
She's really the, you know,
motherly type.

1244
01:32:01,349 --> 01:32:04,467
Vicky, I swear to you on a stack
of bibles, you've got nothing to...

1245
01:32:04,686 --> 01:32:08,350
Hello, everybody, sorry to keep you
waiting. I'm Margaret McKendrick.

1246
01:32:08,648 --> 01:32:11,982
- Hello, hello, hello.
- Oh, hello, again.

1247
01:32:12,652 --> 01:32:15,486
And this must be Vicky.

1248
01:32:15,739 --> 01:32:17,150
Oh, you are adorable.

1249
01:32:17,323 --> 01:32:19,360
I'd know you anywhere
from Mitch's description.

1250
01:32:21,411 --> 01:32:24,279
- I'm Mrs. Robinson.
- Whoops.

1251
01:32:25,415 --> 01:32:28,704
- Sorry, Mitch.
- It could happen to anybody.

1252
01:32:29,878 --> 01:32:31,164
Vicky?

1253
01:32:32,255 --> 01:32:34,872
Oh, you are divine.

1254
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:37,633
Oh, Mitch. She's simply breathtaking.

1255
01:32:37,886 --> 01:32:40,503
I was just thinking the same thing
about you, dear.

1256
01:32:40,805 --> 01:32:42,296
At my age?

1257
01:32:43,475 --> 01:32:46,013
Oh, you are a sweet child.

1258
01:32:46,895 --> 01:32:49,057
Mitch described you somewhat differently.

1259
01:32:49,397 --> 01:32:50,729
He certainly did.

1260
01:32:54,527 --> 01:32:55,563
Excuse me.

1261
01:32:55,779 --> 01:32:58,863
Of course, you know
what husbands think about ex-wives.

1262
01:32:59,282 --> 01:33:02,866
like an old comfortable worn-out shoe
cast in the closet.

1263
01:33:03,244 --> 01:33:07,284
Well, off with the old
and on with the new, eh?

1264
01:33:08,291 --> 01:33:10,203
I must say, you are young.

1265
01:33:11,586 --> 01:33:15,079
- Isn't that lucky for Mitch?
- Yes.

1266
01:33:15,507 --> 01:33:18,124
I was so thrilled when I heard that
you were going to take the plunge

1267
01:33:18,343 --> 01:33:21,757
with old Mitch.
We really must celebrate this occasion.

1268
01:33:22,013 --> 01:33:25,222
Mitch, darling, be a good boy and run
along and open up some champagne.

1269
01:33:25,475 --> 01:33:27,717
Now, tell me all about yourself.

1270
01:33:28,019 --> 01:33:29,885
We really must get to be
very good friends.

1271
01:33:30,146 --> 01:33:34,641
No! I don't want you to get to be
very good friends. That's not the idea.

1272
01:33:35,693 --> 01:33:39,528
- We have to be running anyway.
- Perhaps you'd better...

1273
01:33:39,989 --> 01:33:42,732
All good things have to come to an end,
you know.

1274
01:33:42,992 --> 01:33:45,655
Oh, dear, what a pity,
just as we were getting

1275
01:33:45,870 --> 01:33:47,236
to know each other.

1276
01:33:47,914 --> 01:33:49,496
So nice to have met you.

1277
01:33:51,251 --> 01:33:53,368
I know you won't be coming
to the wedding,

1278
01:33:53,545 --> 01:33:55,878
but you'll see it in the society columns
if you look.

1279
01:33:56,047 --> 01:33:58,289
- I never read them.
- Really? What a shame.

1280
01:33:58,591 --> 01:33:59,832
You miss so much.

1281
01:34:00,927 --> 01:34:04,841
Actually, I never go to funerals
or weddings. I prefer elopements.

1282
01:34:05,390 --> 01:34:06,926
They're much more romantic.

1283
01:34:07,267 --> 01:34:09,884
What a shame you can't stay
and have dinner with Mitch and me.

1284
01:34:10,186 --> 01:34:12,223
- And the children.'
- Yes, Vicky and I have

1285
01:34:12,438 --> 01:34:13,849
a million things to do,

1286
01:34:14,023 --> 01:34:16,640
You know, fittings and odds
and ends to buy.

1287
01:34:17,277 --> 01:34:19,985
Well, just charge it to good old Mitch.
He's loaded.

1288
01:34:20,321 --> 01:34:24,190
- Oh? I didn't really know.
- Oh, didn't you?

1289
01:34:24,951 --> 01:34:27,443
Well, goodbye,
it was so nice to have met you.

1290
01:34:27,745 --> 01:34:31,034
Goodbye, Vicky, darling.
You're just as cute as you can be.

1291
01:34:34,002 --> 01:34:35,334
Bye.

1292
01:34:40,008 --> 01:34:41,795
Delightful, charming woman.

1293
01:34:42,010 --> 01:34:44,673
It's amazing how he ever let
her slip away from him.

1294
01:34:50,977 --> 01:34:54,220
You want me to lose my job?
Your pa will fire me for sure.

1295
01:34:54,355 --> 01:34:56,221
Aw, go on, Hecky. Please.

1296
01:34:56,399 --> 01:34:59,563
We're leaving tomorrow
and I've only got tonight. Please.

1297
01:35:00,195 --> 01:35:03,233
No, I won't be any part
of a conspiracy like this.

1298
01:35:04,199 --> 01:35:08,239
He'll do it, or else he'll cook
his own meals for the next month.

1299
01:35:12,248 --> 01:35:13,659
A gypsy?

1300
01:35:34,395 --> 01:35:36,682
Hey... What happened to dinner?

1301
01:35:36,898 --> 01:35:39,106
Oh, dinner's being served
on the patio tonight.

1302
01:35:39,734 --> 01:35:41,100
Whose idea's that?

1303
01:35:41,361 --> 01:35:44,195
Oh, it's none of my never-mind.
I don't say a word.

1304
01:35:44,447 --> 01:35:46,439
- I know. You never say a word to anyone.
- People talk too much.

1305
01:35:46,532 --> 01:35:48,865
So, I just don't say anything.
I mind my own business.

1306
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:52,119
I've been doing that for years and that's
the way I intend to keep on doing it.

1307
01:35:52,372 --> 01:35:53,863
Hey, Verbena! What the heck's all this?

1308
01:35:54,123 --> 01:35:57,082
Don't ask questions, Daddy.
Go sit down. You want to ruin everything?

1309
01:35:57,293 --> 01:36:01,333
- Ruin what? You gonna tell fortunes?
- Go and sit down. Dinner's ready to serve.

1310
01:36:25,738 --> 01:36:28,651
Well! What's all this?

1311
01:36:29,659 --> 01:36:32,777
I don't know. Don't ask me.
I just got here. It's just my house.

1312
01:36:32,996 --> 01:36:35,488
Nobody ever tells me anything
about what's going on.

1313
01:36:35,748 --> 01:36:39,583
And dinner on the patio.
Was this your idea, Mitch?

1314
01:36:39,961 --> 01:36:43,500
No, it was not my idea.
What are you looking at?

1315
01:36:44,007 --> 01:36:46,841
Oh, Mitch, that eye, it just looks
dreadful.

1316
01:36:47,051 --> 01:36:49,134
Now, really, you must put something on it.

1317
01:36:49,345 --> 01:36:53,055
- Don't you concern yourself.
- What did you do, step on a rake?

1318
01:36:53,308 --> 01:36:58,599
No, actually, a very well-bred, ladylike,
Bostonian matron pinned it on me

1319
01:36:58,771 --> 01:37:00,979
if you want
the Associated Press release on it.

1320
01:37:01,316 --> 01:37:04,309
Anybody I know? Oh, Verbena.

1321
01:37:04,986 --> 01:37:07,478
So, it's special for tonight.
I think you'll like it.

1322
01:37:08,197 --> 01:37:09,779
It smells delicious.

1323
01:37:09,991 --> 01:37:12,734
- Now, what do you call that?
- Veal parmigian.

1324
01:37:12,952 --> 01:37:14,068
Veal?

1325
01:37:14,787 --> 01:37:17,621
I hate that kind of stuff.
She knows that.

1326
01:37:24,297 --> 01:37:27,165
- What do you think you're doing?
- Mitch, please.

1327
01:37:27,342 --> 01:37:29,379
I may go out and kill myself.
I dunno...

1328
01:37:29,635 --> 01:37:31,376
Hecky. Come on, it's time!

1329
01:37:32,263 --> 01:37:35,427
Excuse me, Mitch. All right!

1330
01:37:48,071 --> 01:37:51,815
- Mitch, please don't laugh at this.
- What's the matter with you?

1331
01:37:52,116 --> 01:37:54,403
- Well, don't you see...
- Ladies and gentlemen,

1332
01:37:54,994 --> 01:37:58,078
the management here has gotten together
some entertainment for you.

1333
01:37:58,706 --> 01:38:02,996
Well, without further ado,
ladies and gentlemen,

1334
01:38:03,378 --> 01:38:06,416
I'd like to introduce, direct from Boston,

1335
01:38:06,714 --> 01:38:12,301
playing Beethoven's "Fifth Symphony"
on the piano, Miss Sharon McKendrick.

1336
01:38:50,258 --> 01:38:51,624
Hey, what's all this noise?

1337
01:38:52,093 --> 01:38:55,803
Would you kindly get off the stage?
I'm in the middle of a concert.

1338
01:38:56,097 --> 01:38:57,554
A concert?

1339
01:38:58,015 --> 01:39:01,304
Honey, you're gonna put the paying
customers to sleep with all this jazz.

1340
01:39:01,519 --> 01:39:03,055
You gotta get the new sound.

1341
01:39:09,152 --> 01:39:12,771
Come on now, let's compromise.
You give a little, I'll give a little.

1342
01:39:13,156 --> 01:39:14,522
Come on, let's get together.

1343
01:39:16,659 --> 01:39:17,695
That's it!

1344
01:39:21,289 --> 01:39:23,781
<i>Let's get together,
Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

1345
01:39:24,333 --> 01:39:26,575
<i>Why don't you and I combine?</i>

1346
01:39:27,170 --> 01:39:32,507
<i>Let's get together, what do you say?
We can have a swinging time</i>

1347
01:39:32,758 --> 01:39:35,216
<i>We'd be a crazy team</i>

1348
01:39:35,761 --> 01:39:38,299
<i>Why don't we make the scene?</i>

1349
01:39:39,098 --> 01:39:40,680
<i>Together</i>

1350
01:39:40,933 --> 01:39:44,677
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh
Let's get together, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

1351
01:39:45,229 --> 01:39:47,596
<i>Think of all that we could share</i>

1352
01:39:48,274 --> 01:39:53,235
<i>Let's get together every day
Every way and everywhere</i>

1353
01:39:53,779 --> 01:39:56,146
<i>And though we haven't got a lot</i>

1354
01:39:56,741 --> 01:39:59,279
<i>We could be sharing all we've got</i>

1355
01:40:00,161 --> 01:40:01,572
<i>Together</i>

1356
01:40:03,122 --> 01:40:05,614
<i>Oh, I really think you're swell</i>

1357
01:40:06,042 --> 01:40:08,785
<i>Uh-huh, we really ring the bell</i>

1358
01:40:09,086 --> 01:40:11,669
<i>Oo-wee, and if you stick with me</i>

1359
01:40:12,215 --> 01:40:14,923
<i>Nothing could be greater
Say hey, alligator!</i>

1360
01:40:15,593 --> 01:40:17,710
<i>Let's get together, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

1361
01:40:18,346 --> 01:40:20,588
<i>Two is twice as nice as one</i>

1362
01:40:21,349 --> 01:40:26,344
<i>Let's get together right away
We'll be having twice the fun</i>

1363
01:40:26,854 --> 01:40:29,437
<i>And you can always count on me</i>

1364
01:40:29,815 --> 01:40:32,307
<i>A gruesome twosome we will be</i>

1365
01:40:32,777 --> 01:40:35,895
<i>Let's get together, yeah, yeah, yeah!</i>

1366
01:40:38,407 --> 01:40:40,194
That was wonderful, girls!

1367
01:40:41,953 --> 01:40:44,115
- Great!
- Oh, girls. Marvelous!

1368
01:40:44,497 --> 01:40:47,331
- Come on down and have dinner.
- Yeah, come on, we got spaghetti,

1369
01:40:47,542 --> 01:40:50,125
- all kinds of glop.
- Oh, no, it's all right, thank you.

1370
01:40:50,419 --> 01:40:52,331
We've already had
dinner in the kitchen, haven't we?

1371
01:40:52,547 --> 01:40:55,631
Yes. You go ahead and enjoy yourselves.
We're going to bed.

1372
01:40:55,967 --> 01:40:57,754
Good night, Mom. Good night, Dad.

1373
01:40:57,969 --> 01:41:01,838
Mm-hm. Good night, Mom. Have fun.

1374
01:41:03,349 --> 01:41:05,557
- Good night, girls.
- Night, kids.

1375
01:41:06,602 --> 01:41:08,434
How about those two little monkeys?

1376
01:41:08,980 --> 01:41:10,346
Imagine them putting together
a thing like that?

1377
01:41:10,606 --> 01:41:13,189
Oh, they've put much more
than that together, Mitch.

1378
01:41:13,484 --> 01:41:16,397
- What do you mean?
- Don't you understand?

1379
01:41:16,737 --> 01:41:20,651
The drippy candles, the violin music,
the veal parmigiana.

1380
01:41:22,159 --> 01:41:24,276
Martinelli's. Don't you remember?

1381
01:41:25,371 --> 01:41:28,785
Our first date. They tried to recreate it.

1382
01:41:30,918 --> 01:41:32,625
Crazy, sweet kids.

1383
01:41:36,424 --> 01:41:37,665
What?

1384
01:41:39,427 --> 01:41:40,668
Nothing.

1385
01:41:45,725 --> 01:41:48,342
Well, what are we going to do about them?

1386
01:41:48,894 --> 01:41:51,728
Now that they've met we certainly
can't keep them apart.

1387
01:41:52,898 --> 01:41:54,764
No, we sure can't do that, can we?

1388
01:41:56,944 --> 01:42:02,406
Well, I guess the only logical thing
we can do is, try to share them.

1389
01:42:04,577 --> 01:42:06,193
I mean, you could
take them both for six months,

1390
01:42:06,370 --> 01:42:08,157
then I could have them
for the rest of the year.

1391
01:42:09,248 --> 01:42:11,035
That way at least they'd be together.

1392
01:42:12,543 --> 01:42:16,958
- I think that's the best way. Don't you?
- Yes, I guess it is.

1393
01:42:19,091 --> 01:42:21,754
"Six months' split".
That's what Susan calls it.

1394
01:42:22,011 --> 01:42:23,218
Yeah...

1395
01:42:24,805 --> 01:42:26,421
That's about all we can do.

1396
01:42:28,559 --> 01:42:32,599
You know, Mitch,
all of a sudden, I'm very depressed.

1397
01:42:33,981 --> 01:42:36,689
Oh, Maggie, it would have been worse
if we'd stayed together. You know that.

1398
01:42:36,901 --> 01:42:39,564
All the fighting and squabbling.
You with that Irish temper of yours.

1399
01:42:39,820 --> 01:42:41,982
You were just as difficult
and hard to get along with.

1400
01:42:42,156 --> 01:42:45,615
Oh, sure. I know. I admit it.
It was a mistake in the beginning.

1401
01:42:48,037 --> 01:42:50,871
- Was it, Mitch?
- Well, it's pretty obvious, isn't it?

1402
01:42:51,791 --> 01:42:56,377
You know, you haven't changed much.
The years have been good to you, Mitch.

1403
01:42:57,129 --> 01:42:58,461
Yeah.

1404
01:43:00,716 --> 01:43:04,175
Well, aren't you going to return
the compliment?

1405
01:43:04,970 --> 01:43:09,340
Oh, yeah, you know, as a matter of fact,
Maggie, you look... pretty good.

1406
01:43:09,975 --> 01:43:13,844
Oh, don't stumble over the words.
You know, you don't have to say them!

1407
01:43:13,979 --> 01:43:18,189
No, really, I mean it.
What did you do to yourself anyway?

1408
01:43:18,943 --> 01:43:20,400
Do to myself?

1409
01:43:22,154 --> 01:43:25,693
Sixteen plastic surgeons
and a major reconstruction job on my face

1410
01:43:25,866 --> 01:43:28,153
- just so that I could be presentable!
- Oh, Maggie...

1411
01:43:28,327 --> 01:43:32,071
Well, who do you think I am, some troll
who crawled out of the woods

1412
01:43:32,331 --> 01:43:34,368
- to come calling on you?
- Honey, all I wanted to...

1413
01:43:34,667 --> 01:43:38,502
Oh, I admit I'm not as young as that
simpering baby-faced, platinum doll

1414
01:43:38,671 --> 01:43:40,663
- who's got her hooks in you.
- Don't get started on Vicky.

1415
01:43:41,006 --> 01:43:44,750
Oh, that's right, don't say anything
about that dear, sweet, precious Vicky!

1416
01:43:44,969 --> 01:43:48,258
That plotz-faced child bride
and her electric hips!

1417
01:43:58,733 --> 01:44:02,443
- I'm sorry, Mitch.
- It always happens, doesn't it?

1418
01:44:03,320 --> 01:44:04,527
Yeah.

1419
01:44:05,030 --> 01:44:07,647
Well, it won't happen anymore.

1420
01:44:08,868 --> 01:44:10,825
I'm leaving in the morning with Sharon.

1421
01:44:13,456 --> 01:44:15,413
I really do mean this, Mitch.

1422
01:44:16,125 --> 01:44:18,833
I wish you the best
of everything with Vicky.

1423
01:44:28,262 --> 01:44:32,723
Holy smokes!
What a lousy mess they made of that.

1424
01:44:33,642 --> 01:44:37,852
All our plans...
and Mother and I will be leaving tomorrow.

1425
01:44:39,482 --> 01:44:43,101
Well, don't give up.
We've got all night to think of something.

1426
01:44:43,903 --> 01:44:45,269
Like what?

1427
01:44:47,782 --> 01:44:49,148
I don't know.

1428
01:44:52,953 --> 01:44:54,410
But something.

1429
01:44:58,375 --> 01:45:01,959
- Sharon! Taxi's waiting.
- I'm coming.

1430
01:45:02,588 --> 01:45:06,002
Susan, aren't you coming down
to say goodbye to me?

1431
01:45:06,217 --> 01:45:07,833
Be right there, Mother!

1432
01:45:22,900 --> 01:45:24,983
Sharon! Susan!

1433
01:45:28,113 --> 01:45:30,446
I'll send Susan back for Christmas.

1434
01:45:32,660 --> 01:45:36,244
I'll see that Sharon comes
out here for Easter.

1435
01:45:37,206 --> 01:45:38,947
Well, I suppose that's the best way.

1436
01:45:42,545 --> 01:45:43,786
I suppose so.

1437
01:45:53,305 --> 01:45:55,171
What are you doing in those clothes?

1438
01:45:56,475 --> 01:45:57,932
Sharon, what is this?

1439
01:45:58,227 --> 01:46:00,264
Well, I'll tell you.
We've thought it over.

1440
01:46:00,437 --> 01:46:01,894
And we've come to a decision.

1441
01:46:02,398 --> 01:46:06,017
- Yep. We decided we were getting gypped.
- Yeah, gypped.

1442
01:46:06,402 --> 01:46:07,813
- What?
- Now, what do you mean, "gypped"?

1443
01:46:08,445 --> 01:46:13,406
Well, we decided that we wanted
to spend our camp-out together.

1444
01:46:14,076 --> 01:46:17,240
- So whichever one of us is Sharon...
- And we won't tell.

1445
01:46:17,872 --> 01:46:20,910
Whichever one of us is Sharon,
we're not going to Boston.

1446
01:46:22,418 --> 01:46:24,410
Now, don't get smart with me, girls.

1447
01:46:25,546 --> 01:46:28,584
Sharon, go right upstairs
and put your suit on. Now, go on.

1448
01:46:28,757 --> 01:46:32,125
- Are you sure she's Sharon?
- Of course, she is.

1449
01:46:34,430 --> 01:46:35,466
Aren't you?

1450
01:46:37,224 --> 01:46:39,591
- Tough to tell, ain't it?
- Ain't it?

1451
01:46:39,894 --> 01:46:42,602
Isn't it!
Now, stop all of this foolishness.

1452
01:46:42,771 --> 01:46:45,354
- We're going to miss the plane.
- That's the whole idea.

1453
01:46:47,693 --> 01:46:50,356
- Mitch, do something!
- Susan...

1454
01:46:50,529 --> 01:46:51,940
- Yes, Daddy?
- Yes, Daddy?

1455
01:46:52,531 --> 01:46:55,274
- That's not funny.
- That's not funny.

1456
01:46:55,492 --> 01:46:58,985
- That's not funny.
- This one is Susan, the smart-alec here.

1457
01:46:59,496 --> 01:47:00,577
Are you sure?

1458
01:47:00,789 --> 01:47:02,826
Of course, I'm sure.
I know my own daughter, don't I?

1459
01:47:03,626 --> 01:47:05,709
You're not really sure, are you, Daddy?

1460
01:47:11,008 --> 01:47:14,172
- You know, I'm not.
- I think they're ready to listen.

1461
01:47:14,762 --> 01:47:16,845
Right. Here's the deal.

1462
01:47:17,222 --> 01:47:20,636
We leave for the camp-out immediately.
All of us.

1463
01:47:21,560 --> 01:47:23,472
And when you bring us back on Friday,

1464
01:47:23,938 --> 01:47:26,897
then we'll tell you
who's Sharon and who's Susan.

1465
01:47:27,149 --> 01:47:29,937
That's the deal. Take it or leave it.

1466
01:47:36,533 --> 01:47:37,899
What am I supposed to do for three days

1467
01:47:38,118 --> 01:47:40,531
while you're off on some crazy trip
into the woods? Stay home and knit?

1468
01:47:40,788 --> 01:47:42,871
It's not my fault.
Now, I can't tell them apart.

1469
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:44,156
What do you want me to do?

1470
01:47:44,333 --> 01:47:46,290
Give them a good spanking
and make them tell!

1471
01:47:46,543 --> 01:47:49,877
Oh, you don't spank 13-year-olds,
especially for something like this.

1472
01:47:50,130 --> 01:47:51,416
- Don't you understand?
- Is she coming along?

1473
01:47:51,674 --> 01:47:53,961
- That's part of the deal. Don't ask...
- Mitch, I will not have it.

1474
01:47:54,301 --> 01:47:55,667
Good morning, Vicky.

1475
01:47:56,303 --> 01:47:58,636
I will not sit here while you're off
prowling through the woods with her.

1476
01:47:58,806 --> 01:48:01,549
- You're absolutely right.
- Maggie, will you keep out of this.

1477
01:48:01,767 --> 01:48:06,011
Oh, Mitch, you just can't go off and leave
your fiancé alone for three whole days.

1478
01:48:06,230 --> 01:48:07,596
What on earth would people say?

1479
01:48:07,773 --> 01:48:10,857
Sure, all right, group activity leader,
what do you suggest, huh?

1480
01:48:11,068 --> 01:48:15,187
- I think you ought to come along with us.
- Maybe I just will.

1481
01:48:15,406 --> 01:48:17,068
- It's the only decent thing to do.
- Sure...

1482
01:48:17,366 --> 01:48:19,198
Of course, we're gonna have to get you
another outfit.

1483
01:48:19,368 --> 01:48:22,861
But I know where Mitch keeps
his old shirts and we can find you

1484
01:48:23,080 --> 01:48:26,073
some boots, and very quickly
we'll have you all fixed up...

1485
01:48:29,169 --> 01:48:33,379
- Are they all coming with us?
- Yup.

1486
01:48:35,968 --> 01:48:39,302
- Hecky, here's some more stuff.
- All right, keep your shirt on, girl.

1487
01:48:39,471 --> 01:48:40,712
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi.

1488
01:48:44,309 --> 01:48:46,926
Everything's almost packed.
Why don't we get going?

1489
01:48:47,104 --> 01:48:48,345
You got enough?

1490
01:48:48,647 --> 01:48:51,230
- Just fasten the belt a bit tighter.
- Yes.

1491
01:48:51,692 --> 01:48:54,810
- Where does she think she's going?
- She's gonna come along, honey.

1492
01:48:55,154 --> 01:48:56,816
- Are you kidding?
- Nope.

1493
01:48:57,031 --> 01:48:58,693
- And besides it's waterproof.
- Peachy, yeah.

1494
01:48:58,991 --> 01:49:00,607
Wonderful. Oh, here we are, Mitch.

1495
01:49:00,826 --> 01:49:03,569
- All ready to go.
- But she can't come along!

1496
01:49:04,163 --> 01:49:05,870
Now, girls, don't be rude.

1497
01:49:06,415 --> 01:49:09,783
We decided that your
father couldn't possibly leave Vicky alone

1498
01:49:09,918 --> 01:49:11,204
for three whole days.

1499
01:49:11,795 --> 01:49:13,457
Well, let's get the show
on the road, huh?

1500
01:49:14,089 --> 01:49:15,921
You first, Vicky.
You'll want to sit beside Mitch.

1501
01:49:16,133 --> 01:49:17,624
- Won't you?
- If you don't mind.

1502
01:49:17,926 --> 01:49:20,589
My pleasure.
You know, the way things have worked out,

1503
01:49:20,804 --> 01:49:23,296
I think you and Vicky ought to be
up there alone.

1504
01:49:23,515 --> 01:49:24,756
What are you saying?

1505
01:49:26,769 --> 01:49:30,388
- Maggie, in or out? Come on, will you?
- If you're not going, I...

1506
01:49:30,731 --> 01:49:33,644
Now, now, Vicky. Don't worry
your pretty little head about me.

1507
01:49:33,859 --> 01:49:36,897
I'll just lie around the lake
and soak up plenty of sun.

1508
01:49:38,238 --> 01:49:40,651
Besides, it'll give you a chance
to get to know the girls.

1509
01:49:40,908 --> 01:49:44,777
You're going to have them for six months
out of the year. Bye, Vicky.

1510
01:49:45,245 --> 01:49:47,077
- Watch out for snakes.
- Thanks a lot!

1511
01:49:47,206 --> 01:49:49,448
Bye, girls. Have a good time. Bye!

1512
01:50:08,102 --> 01:50:09,092
Oh...

1513
01:50:09,269 --> 01:50:12,728
- You all right?
- Oh, I'm just dandy. Some fun.

1514
01:50:13,232 --> 01:50:16,396
- What's the matter?
- Vicky's not used to this, honey.

1515
01:50:17,027 --> 01:50:18,268
We'll rest a minute, huh?

1516
01:50:20,697 --> 01:50:22,984
The lake's not far now.
Just about another hour, is all.

1517
01:50:23,951 --> 01:50:26,284
Look. I'll put it on, yes?

1518
01:50:29,414 --> 01:50:31,906
- Gee, is it hot?
- What of it?

1519
01:50:33,168 --> 01:50:35,751
Well, I just thought maybe you'd like
some of my water.

1520
01:50:40,092 --> 01:50:41,253
Thanks a lot.

1521
01:50:42,010 --> 01:50:43,751
Oh, no, there's a thing on there!

1522
01:50:44,096 --> 01:50:46,679
Oh, there's a thing on there!

1523
01:50:46,932 --> 01:50:50,346
- What is it?
- It's only a little old tree lizard.

1524
01:50:50,769 --> 01:50:52,931
Look, Daddy.
It wouldn't hurt anybody. Look.

1525
01:50:53,105 --> 01:50:56,644
- Get that thing away from me! Get it away!
- Cut that out!

1526
01:50:56,900 --> 01:50:58,266
- It's OK, come on.
- No... no...

1527
01:50:58,610 --> 01:51:01,694
Oh, get that away from me.
I hate them. They're just miserable.

1528
01:51:03,991 --> 01:51:06,278
Now you two stay here and help Vicky,
understand?

1529
01:51:06,618 --> 01:51:08,200
Yeah, sure we'll help her, Dad.

1530
01:51:12,749 --> 01:51:15,617
Sure you'll help me.
Right over a cliff you'll help me.

1531
01:51:17,379 --> 01:51:18,415
What did we do?

1532
01:51:21,049 --> 01:51:24,884
Never you mind those angelic faces.
I know vixen when I see 'em.

1533
01:51:26,305 --> 01:51:27,512
Just remember this.

1534
01:51:27,723 --> 01:51:32,343
You start anything and I'll make your
lives just miserable for you later on.

1535
01:51:32,728 --> 01:51:34,185
You get me, pets?

1536
01:51:50,370 --> 01:51:53,113
See that? Cougar tracks.

1537
01:51:53,665 --> 01:51:57,124
- It's a form of mountain lion.
- No kidding? Lions?

1538
01:51:57,336 --> 01:52:01,671
Sure. There are hundreds of 'em up here.
They'll really mess you up.

1539
01:52:01,924 --> 01:52:04,587
They'll grab at your eyes.
They'll eat you, you know.

1540
01:52:05,552 --> 01:52:09,341
But there's a trick
an old Indian guide showed me.

1541
01:52:10,682 --> 01:52:12,969
See? You hit two sticks together like this

1542
01:52:13,185 --> 01:52:14,801
and the noise frightens them
and they won't eat you.

1543
01:52:15,687 --> 01:52:18,145
- Like that?
- Yeah. That'll keep them away.

1544
01:52:19,399 --> 01:52:20,731
Come on.

1545
01:52:34,873 --> 01:52:36,614
Quick.

1546
01:52:44,716 --> 01:52:45,832
Hey!

1547
01:52:46,510 --> 01:52:49,753
- Enjoying yourself?
- Perfectly wonderful time.

1548
01:52:51,306 --> 01:52:52,968
My feet are killing me.

1549
01:52:53,392 --> 01:52:56,510
Oh, why don't you go down and soak them
in the lake. That'll cool them off.

1550
01:52:56,812 --> 01:52:58,519
- You think?
- Oh, sure. Go on.

1551
01:52:58,689 --> 01:53:00,021
I'll try anything.

1552
01:53:15,664 --> 01:53:18,327
- Come on in. It's not deep.
- Are you sure?

1553
01:53:18,583 --> 01:53:21,041
Sure I'm sure. Look, I'm standing.

1554
01:53:28,802 --> 01:53:30,009
Oh!

1555
01:53:31,221 --> 01:53:32,462
Mitch, come on!

1556
01:53:42,941 --> 01:53:44,773
Hecky, you really did yourself proud.

1557
01:53:45,235 --> 01:53:49,605
Thanks, Mitch.
You sure you won't change your mind, Miss?

1558
01:53:49,781 --> 01:53:52,649
I detest trout!
How many times do I have to tell you?

1559
01:53:52,951 --> 01:53:54,988
I'll wait and eat in the morning.

1560
01:53:55,787 --> 01:53:59,076
- What are we having for breakfast?
- Trout.

1561
01:54:00,834 --> 01:54:02,917
We don't catch fish
just to throw 'em away.

1562
01:54:03,211 --> 01:54:05,828
We always eat off the trail up here.
That's part of the fun of it.

1563
01:54:06,048 --> 01:54:07,835
Only part of the fun? Swell.

1564
01:54:08,008 --> 01:54:10,295
What do you do on Saturday nights?
Go down and throw rocks in the lake?

1565
01:54:10,552 --> 01:54:12,134
Look, you insisted on coming.

1566
01:54:12,304 --> 01:54:14,170
Now, the least you can do is
make the best of it.

1567
01:54:14,431 --> 01:54:16,844
I was tricked into coming. She tricked me.

1568
01:54:17,267 --> 01:54:20,635
She sure did, didn't she?

1569
01:54:22,814 --> 01:54:25,477
If you wanna go back,
Hecky can always take you down.

1570
01:54:26,193 --> 01:54:27,479
Why, sure, Miss.

1571
01:54:27,778 --> 01:54:29,610
I'd be happy to walk you
down to the truck.

1572
01:54:33,200 --> 01:54:35,032
I'll stick it out, thanks.

1573
01:54:36,953 --> 01:54:41,288
Oh, do they think I'm running a free
blood bank? I think they like this stuff.

1574
01:54:41,750 --> 01:54:44,117
- What have you got?
- Oh, mosquito repellent.

1575
01:54:46,004 --> 01:54:47,711
It doesn't even smell like anything.

1576
01:54:49,549 --> 01:54:52,041
For Pete's sake,
that's nothing but sugar and water.

1577
01:54:53,553 --> 01:54:54,794
- What?
- Sure.

1578
01:54:55,013 --> 01:54:57,926
That'll bring every mosquito for 50 miles
around. Where did you get that?

1579
01:55:00,268 --> 01:55:04,979
An old Indian scout gave it to me.
Said it would keep the mosquitoes away.

1580
01:55:09,277 --> 01:55:12,270
Hecky, I think I'll have some more
of that wonderful trout.

1581
01:55:13,073 --> 01:55:14,189
Oh, yeah.

1582
01:55:15,242 --> 01:55:16,574
I'm turning in.

1583
01:55:17,577 --> 01:55:19,239
- Good night.
- Good night.

1584
01:55:19,871 --> 01:55:21,703
- Good night, Vicky.
- Good night, Vicky.

1585
01:55:36,888 --> 01:55:37,969
Vicky?

1586
01:55:43,311 --> 01:55:44,847
Honey, what are you doing with the sticks?

1587
01:55:45,564 --> 01:55:48,648
What do you think I'm doing?
I'm keeping the mountain lions away.

1588
01:55:48,900 --> 01:55:51,688
- Mountain lions?
- Yeah. The noise...

1589
01:55:54,364 --> 01:55:56,902
The noise doesn't
frighten mountain lions away.

1590
01:55:57,117 --> 01:55:58,324
Not a bit.

1591
01:55:59,327 --> 01:56:00,568
Good night.

1592
01:56:10,547 --> 01:56:13,585
- Now, just why did you do that to Vicky?
- Daddy, I swear that...

1593
01:56:13,925 --> 01:56:18,920
Never mind.
It's a terrible thing to do. Isn't it?

1594
01:56:21,308 --> 01:56:23,049
- Just terrible.
- Sure.

1595
01:56:24,603 --> 01:56:27,721
Now, I don't want any more of that
from either of you. You understand?

1596
01:56:27,981 --> 01:56:29,973
- Yes, Daddy.
- Both of you?

1597
01:56:30,317 --> 01:56:32,934
- Yes, Daddy.
- All right.

1598
01:57:44,224 --> 01:57:46,887
Let me out of here!
Let me out of here!

1599
01:57:47,143 --> 01:57:48,554
Let me out!

1600
01:57:49,980 --> 01:57:52,893
Let me out of here! Get them away from me!
Get those wild animals out!

1601
01:57:53,316 --> 01:57:55,683
Get them away! I hate them!

1602
01:57:56,695 --> 01:57:58,652
Get them out!
Get them away from me!

1603
01:57:58,863 --> 01:58:00,229
Get them away from me!

1604
01:58:00,448 --> 01:58:04,158
I hate this place.
I hate this filthy, stinking, dirty place!

1605
01:58:04,452 --> 01:58:07,991
What are you yelling about, Miss?
It's just litty-bitty old bear cubs.

1606
01:58:08,206 --> 01:58:09,572
They wouldn't hurt a fly.

1607
01:58:10,584 --> 01:58:13,418
You shut up and get me my boots!

1608
01:58:14,879 --> 01:58:15,915
Yes, ma'am.

1609
01:58:16,256 --> 01:58:19,795
I hate this place!
This may be somebody's idea of fun!

1610
01:58:20,010 --> 01:58:23,754
But it's not mine! I hate the fish!
I hate the lake! I hate the bees!

1611
01:58:23,972 --> 01:58:26,385
I hate the filthy bugs!
I can't stand this place!

1612
01:58:26,641 --> 01:58:28,507
What the heck are you doing
with the food?

1613
01:58:29,894 --> 01:58:33,808
- What's the matter? What's happening?
- Ya big overgrown jerk! It's not worth it!

1614
01:58:36,192 --> 01:58:37,933
Do you want your clothes, Vicky?

1615
01:58:40,739 --> 01:58:44,824
Thanks a heap. You, you're twins.
Do you share everything?

1616
01:58:44,993 --> 01:58:46,484
- Everything.
- Everything.

1617
01:58:46,786 --> 01:58:49,324
Well, you give your sister
her half of this!

1618
01:58:50,749 --> 01:58:53,992
Wait a minute. There's no cause for that.
They didn't do anything to you.

1619
01:58:54,377 --> 01:58:57,996
You'll never know what they did to me,
you big goon!

1620
01:58:58,798 --> 01:59:00,755
Get me out of this stinking fresh air!

1621
01:59:11,645 --> 01:59:14,513
- Mother, where are you?
- Hi!

1622
01:59:16,483 --> 01:59:20,193
- You're back early. Which one are you?
- Sharon.

1623
01:59:20,445 --> 01:59:23,483
- Did you have a good time?
- Oh, sensational! But...

1624
01:59:24,282 --> 01:59:26,865
Well, at least we did,
but I don't think Vicky did.

1625
01:59:27,077 --> 01:59:29,034
- Well, what happened?
- Hi, Mom.

1626
01:59:29,496 --> 01:59:31,328
- Hi.
- How are you?

1627
01:59:31,581 --> 01:59:33,538
- Wonderful.
- Hello, there.

1628
01:59:33,917 --> 01:59:34,998
Good evening.

1629
01:59:35,919 --> 01:59:38,411
- Have you had your dinner?
- Oh, we're not hungry.

1630
01:59:38,880 --> 01:59:40,837
Then I think you'd better go upstairs
and have your baths.

1631
01:59:40,924 --> 01:59:43,587
- You both look pretty filthy to me.
- OK, then we'll tell you

1632
01:59:43,677 --> 01:59:46,010
about Vicky, but not while he's there, OK?

1633
01:59:46,096 --> 01:59:47,303
Sh... OK.

1634
01:59:51,851 --> 01:59:54,810
So you had a wonderful time.
What happened?

1635
01:59:55,355 --> 01:59:58,063
Oh, now, don't you give me that
with the big eyes, "What happened?"

1636
01:59:58,149 --> 02:00:00,061
You knew darn well
what was going to happen.

1637
02:00:00,402 --> 02:00:01,893
Well, what happened?

1638
02:00:02,153 --> 02:00:05,066
All right. You name it and it happened.
The whole thing was a shambles.

1639
02:00:05,156 --> 02:00:06,488
- Now, are you happy?
- Tsk, tsk, tsk.

1640
02:00:06,574 --> 02:00:09,567
It's the last time I'm gonna take a woman
to the mountains, that's all I got to say.

1641
02:00:09,869 --> 02:00:12,737
Oh, uh, where's, um, what's-her-name?

1642
02:00:13,456 --> 02:00:15,789
- Vicky? Yeah...
- Yeah, Vicky.

1643
02:00:16,376 --> 02:00:18,208
Well, she took off like a pelican,

1644
02:00:18,294 --> 02:00:21,037
and she's probably at Park Avenue
and 57th Street by now,

1645
02:00:21,548 --> 02:00:23,084
and good luck to her.

1646
02:00:31,474 --> 02:00:32,760
Well?

1647
02:00:33,685 --> 02:00:35,267
We've been talking.

1648
02:00:36,354 --> 02:00:38,562
And we feel that we owe you an apology.

1649
02:00:39,816 --> 02:00:43,400
Well, I mean we feel sort of guilty
about what we did to Vicky.

1650
02:00:44,654 --> 02:00:47,488
- What did you do to her?
- Well...

1651
02:00:49,826 --> 02:00:51,613
I guess you could say we submarined her.

1652
02:00:54,414 --> 02:00:58,749
Well, it's none of our business who
you wanna marry, and we ruined it for you.

1653
02:00:59,169 --> 02:01:04,585
Well, it's done with now
so we won't talk about it anymore.

1654
02:01:05,633 --> 02:01:08,000
We're really sorry, Dad.
Will you forgive us?

1655
02:01:09,095 --> 02:01:11,087
Oh, go on to bed, you monsters.

1656
02:01:17,937 --> 02:01:19,428
What are you gonna do, huh?

1657
02:01:22,567 --> 02:01:26,231
- Do you want something to eat?
- Well then, you sure you've got enough?

1658
02:01:26,780 --> 02:01:30,820
Oh, sure, I cooked enough for you
and Susan for dinner tomorrow night.

1659
02:01:31,618 --> 02:01:34,156
Remember, Sharon and I are leaving
in the morning.

1660
02:01:34,704 --> 02:01:37,663
- Oh, yeah.
- Wash your hands.

1661
02:01:38,500 --> 02:01:39,911
Oh, yeah. I'd better.

1662
02:02:00,605 --> 02:02:02,847
Where's Verbena anyway?

1663
02:02:03,399 --> 02:02:05,265
I wasn't expecting you back.

1664
02:02:05,485 --> 02:02:08,694
It didn't make sense for her to stay
around here just for me,

1665
02:02:08,947 --> 02:02:10,859
so I gave her the night off.

1666
02:02:15,203 --> 02:02:17,661
Say, you know,
I think I'll just go upstairs and wash up.

1667
02:02:17,872 --> 02:02:19,613
I'll be right back. I'll just be a minute.

1668
02:02:32,387 --> 02:02:33,594
I don't know what he saw in her.

1669
02:02:33,805 --> 02:02:37,139
She had a horrid taste in clothes
and absolutely no personality at all.

1670
02:02:37,392 --> 02:02:39,349
Wow.

1671
02:02:39,727 --> 02:02:41,263
Where are you going to? A party?

1672
02:02:41,855 --> 02:02:46,350
That is none of your business.
Good night, ladies. Sleep tight.

1673
02:02:56,744 --> 02:02:57,734
Hi.

1674
02:02:58,037 --> 02:03:01,405
Well... I thought you were just
going to "wash your hands".

1675
02:03:01,624 --> 02:03:04,458
Oh, well, I got started, I thought I might
as well do a good job of it.

1676
02:03:04,752 --> 02:03:05,913
- Sh.
- What?

1677
02:03:06,254 --> 02:03:07,540
Do you hear music?

1678
02:03:08,089 --> 02:03:11,582
Are those children looking at television
when I told them to take a bath?

1679
02:03:11,843 --> 02:03:12,833
Oh, that's the hi-fi.

1680
02:03:13,011 --> 02:03:15,173
I just snapped it on
when I was coming downstairs.

1681
02:03:15,388 --> 02:03:17,471
I thought a little music would be nice
with dinner.

1682
02:03:24,147 --> 02:03:27,766
Also, I thought a little red wine might be
good with the stew, huh?

1683
02:03:28,109 --> 02:03:31,318
Oh...

1684
02:03:32,405 --> 02:03:37,742
To the mother of my children and the most
beautiful mother any two kids ever had.

1685
02:03:38,161 --> 02:03:40,778
Oh, Mitch, you can be
the most exasperating man.

1686
02:03:40,955 --> 02:03:42,116
What did I say? What's the matter?

1687
02:03:42,332 --> 02:03:46,076
Waiting until we're here in the kitchen
eating stew and me in my bare feet.

1688
02:03:46,294 --> 02:03:50,914
- I like you in bare feet.
- Well, it puts a woman at a disadvantage.

1689
02:03:51,215 --> 02:03:53,081
Good. Here's to your disadvantage.

1690
02:04:01,559 --> 02:04:04,643
- Here. Sit down and eat your stew.
- Yes, ma'am.

1691
02:04:04,854 --> 02:04:05,970
Don't spill it now.

1692
02:04:13,071 --> 02:04:15,028
- Oh, darn!
- What's the matter?

1693
02:04:15,281 --> 02:04:18,649
I've got a wet dishcloth on
and I put some knots in it.

1694
02:04:18,826 --> 02:04:19,942
Open it for me.

1695
02:04:22,872 --> 02:04:26,081
Maggie, as long as
everybody's apologizing,

1696
02:04:26,292 --> 02:04:28,204
I think maybe I'd better do mine too.

1697
02:04:28,503 --> 02:04:32,873
I mean, about the other night.
I didn't mean for it to sound like that.

1698
02:04:33,925 --> 02:04:35,962
I guess I'm not very good
with a compliment,

1699
02:04:36,219 --> 02:04:37,960
what with growing up
out here with the cows.

1700
02:04:38,346 --> 02:04:41,930
Oh, now, don't give me that old
growing-up-with-the-cows routine.

1701
02:04:42,141 --> 02:04:43,507
You handed me that years ago.

1702
02:04:43,685 --> 02:04:45,392
- I did not.
- You certainly did.

1703
02:04:46,896 --> 02:04:49,934
Well, it worked, didn't it? You liked it.

1704
02:05:06,874 --> 02:05:08,581
Oh, Maggie, you're so beautiful.

1705
02:05:10,628 --> 02:05:11,618
No. I mean it.

1706
02:05:12,338 --> 02:05:15,627
I know I don't say things
like you want to hear 'em,

1707
02:05:17,427 --> 02:05:18,884
but I've been thinking a lot about you.

1708
02:05:20,596 --> 02:05:22,588
And us, and the way things used to be.

1709
02:05:25,810 --> 02:05:28,928
This might sound funny to you,
but do you know what I miss most of all?

1710
02:05:29,188 --> 02:05:30,645
- Mitch?
- Hm?

1711
02:05:32,025 --> 02:05:34,108
You've got stew all over you.

1712
02:05:36,654 --> 02:05:39,567
- I don't care.
- Go and wash it off.

1713
02:05:50,334 --> 02:05:51,700
What do you miss?

1714
02:05:53,463 --> 02:05:54,749
Well...

1715
02:05:57,633 --> 02:05:59,545
I don't care if it does sound silly.

1716
02:06:00,803 --> 02:06:04,171
I miss those wet stockings you used
to have hanging around the bathroom.

1717
02:06:06,350 --> 02:06:09,388
And I miss my razor being dull
because you used it

1718
02:06:09,604 --> 02:06:10,970
to shave your legs with.

1719
02:06:15,568 --> 02:06:18,982
I miss the hairpins mixed up
with the fish hooks in my tackle box.

1720
02:06:22,283 --> 02:06:24,821
It's no fun having
a clothes closet all to myself.

1721
02:06:27,371 --> 02:06:29,237
And it's no fun swearing, because...

1722
02:06:30,083 --> 02:06:33,702
you're not around
to make believe you're shocked by it.

1723
02:06:38,007 --> 02:06:40,966
Nothing's any good without you, Maggie.
I miss a lot of things.

1724
02:06:42,512 --> 02:06:44,174
I guess I just miss you.

1725
02:06:47,809 --> 02:06:50,051
Why did you take so long to tell me?

1726
02:06:51,646 --> 02:06:52,932
I don't know.

1727
02:06:56,025 --> 02:06:57,266
Well, because...

1728
02:06:59,695 --> 02:07:02,608
'Cause I guess I was hoping
that you'd come back sometime.

1729
02:07:04,700 --> 02:07:09,491
Maggie, I've been the prize chump
of the world. We've both been.

1730
02:07:12,208 --> 02:07:16,043
We're going to grow
into a couple of old lonely people

1731
02:07:16,254 --> 02:07:17,586
if we don't do something about it.

1732
02:07:18,297 --> 02:07:20,755
- I know.
- You don't want that, do you?

1733
02:07:21,843 --> 02:07:23,050
No, Mitch.

1734
02:07:38,109 --> 02:07:39,566
Oh, Mitch.

1735
02:07:39,944 --> 02:07:43,779
It's been so long. So very long.

1736
02:07:46,576 --> 02:07:47,783
Don't cry.

1737
02:07:47,952 --> 02:07:51,696
Listen, you can slug me in the eye
anytime you want.

1738
02:07:52,498 --> 02:07:53,955
OK.

1739
02:07:59,380 --> 02:08:01,042
Oh...

1740
02:08:03,926 --> 02:08:05,133
What's the matter?

1741
02:08:05,428 --> 02:08:08,216
Oh, my gosh.
I just had the craziest dream.

1742
02:08:08,556 --> 02:08:11,139
- Oh, my goodness.
- What is it?

1743
02:08:11,851 --> 02:08:17,063
You and I were marching along real slow,
sort of funny-like, in organdie dresses.

1744
02:08:17,815 --> 02:08:19,898
And there was music coming from someplace,

1745
02:08:20,401 --> 02:08:22,563
<i>and there were flowers and people.</i>
