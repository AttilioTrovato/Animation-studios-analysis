1
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,327
[man] Toby!

2
00:00:17,428 --> 00:00:19,793
Toby Tyler!

3
00:00:23,563 --> 00:00:25,562
Toby.

4
00:00:27,598 --> 00:00:30,197
Where are you?

5
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:34,998
Toby.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,500
Toby Tyler.

7
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,921
[brass band playing]

8
00:01:25,778 --> 00:01:28,038
[crowd cheering]

9
00:01:37,475 --> 00:01:40,124
[roaring]

10
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,980
[monkeys screeching]

11
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,255
Stand back, please.
Make way for the elephants.

12
00:02:00,357 --> 00:02:04,325
Make way for the elephants.
Look out there.
This is dangerous.

13
00:02:04,427 --> 00:02:07,028
- Stand back.
Stand back, please.
- [laughing]

14
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:09,899
Make way for the elephants.

15
00:03:04,553 --> 00:03:06,921
[roaring]

16
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:35,081
[calliope playing]

17
00:04:07,545 --> 00:04:12,350
[man] Here you are, ladies and
gents. Get a cane, get a whip.

18
00:04:12,451 --> 00:04:17,322
One cent, and here's
a balloon for you.
Just a penny, a copper penny.

19
00:04:17,422 --> 00:04:21,326
Balloons here.
One penny. One copper penny.

20
00:04:21,426 --> 00:04:24,496
- Balloons here...
- [man] Get your tickets
for the show.

21
00:04:24,596 --> 00:04:27,197
My balloon.
I want to get another balloon.

22
00:04:27,299 --> 00:04:30,735
[man] Balloons here,
all kinds, all colors...

23
00:04:32,604 --> 00:04:34,505
Step right in
and enjoy the show.

24
00:04:34,606 --> 00:04:36,741
Hurry, now. Step in
and enjoy the show.

25
00:04:36,842 --> 00:04:40,011
Hurry, hurry, hurry.
Are you going in?

26
00:04:40,112 --> 00:04:41,778
No, sir.

27
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,981
Step in and enjoy
the show, gentlemen.

28
00:04:44,082 --> 00:04:47,484
[man] There you are,
little lady, and thank you,
madam, very much.

29
00:04:47,585 --> 00:04:50,520
Ladies and gentlemen, step right
up. Fresh-roasted peanuts.

30
00:04:50,621 --> 00:04:55,392
Peanuts, popcorn,
candied apples and taffy,
all fresh and delicious.

31
00:04:55,493 --> 00:04:57,594
All right, folks,
step right up here.

32
00:04:57,695 --> 00:05:02,133
The peanuts are grown
on the plantation and roasted
here on the premises.

33
00:05:03,701 --> 00:05:05,569
Are you a looker
or a buyer?

34
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:08,672
About how many peanuts would you
say I could get for a penny?

35
00:05:08,772 --> 00:05:12,375
In the normal course
of business, I don't
sell them by the penny.

36
00:05:12,476 --> 00:05:14,544
- [sighing] Oh.
- However,

37
00:05:14,645 --> 00:05:17,747
seeing as you're a handsome
young rooster with cash in hand,

38
00:05:17,848 --> 00:05:20,050
I devise I might
part with, say,

39
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:23,019
oh, six genuine plantation-grown
Georgie goobers.

40
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,286
Six?

41
00:05:24,388 --> 00:05:26,722
It's more than
if you bought them by the bag.

42
00:05:26,823 --> 00:05:29,525
That's a solemn fact.

43
00:05:30,193 --> 00:05:32,360
Here.

44
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:46,575
Folks, step up.
It's all fresh and
it's all refreshing.

45
00:05:46,676 --> 00:05:49,745
Nice and cold and refreshing.
Plantation peanuts.

46
00:05:49,845 --> 00:05:51,747
Do you swap the ones
that are bad?

47
00:05:51,847 --> 00:05:55,883
Bad? I don't vend bad peanuts
in my establishment, boy.

48
00:05:55,985 --> 00:06:01,190
Maybe a little underbred,
perhaps timeworn,
but not really bad.

49
00:06:02,124 --> 00:06:04,458
Tastes bad.

50
00:06:04,559 --> 00:06:07,561
Here's two more. Run along,
or you'll miss the best part.

51
00:06:07,662 --> 00:06:10,164
- Oh, I'm not going.
- Not going?

52
00:06:10,266 --> 00:06:12,499
Ah, you lack
the price of a ticket.

53
00:06:12,601 --> 00:06:13,968
Yes, sir.

54
00:06:14,068 --> 00:06:17,138
I suppose your parents
are bringing you tonight.

55
00:06:17,239 --> 00:06:19,573
No, sir, I don't
have any parents.

56
00:06:23,477 --> 00:06:25,847
Orphan boy, eh?

57
00:06:25,948 --> 00:06:29,482
Well, have you ever thought
of joining the circus, lad?

58
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,218
Me?

59
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:35,155
Imagine, being a part of
the glorious confraternity
of the big top.

60
00:06:35,256 --> 00:06:36,824
That company of artistes

61
00:06:36,924 --> 00:06:39,725
who travel
the length and breadth
of this great land of ours.

62
00:06:39,828 --> 00:06:43,463
- How would you like that?
- But what could I do?

63
00:06:43,564 --> 00:06:46,800
You could become...

64
00:06:48,602 --> 00:06:50,170
...a concessionaire.

65
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,939
I could?

66
00:06:54,374 --> 00:06:56,643
- A con...
- ...cessionaire.

67
00:06:56,744 --> 00:06:59,980
Rolls out on the tongue
mighty important, don't it, boy?

68
00:07:00,081 --> 00:07:02,547
- Yes, sir.
- Free transportation,

69
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:06,218
snug place to sleep,
all you can eat,
see the performance anytime,

70
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,353
rub shoulders with the great
and near great.

71
00:07:08,455 --> 00:07:11,923
And if that weren't enough,
each and every Saturday night

72
00:07:12,025 --> 00:07:14,193
yours truly, Harry Tupper,

73
00:07:14,294 --> 00:07:16,461
will present you...

74
00:07:17,429 --> 00:07:18,831
...with one of these.

75
00:07:18,932 --> 00:07:21,167
What do you say, lad?
Is it a bargain?

76
00:07:21,268 --> 00:07:26,272
I'd like that better
than anything else
in the whole world.

77
00:07:26,372 --> 00:07:28,873
You would, eh?

78
00:07:28,975 --> 00:07:32,978
The only trouble is Uncle Daniel
and Aunt Olive need me.

79
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:37,116
Aunt and uncle?

80
00:07:37,217 --> 00:07:41,552
They're awful poor,
and there's lots of work
for me around the farm.

81
00:07:41,653 --> 00:07:44,055
I understand.
It does you credit.

82
00:07:44,156 --> 00:07:47,024
I'm a loyal man myself,
and I love to see it in others.

83
00:07:47,127 --> 00:07:49,660
- I could ask them.
- Don't give it another thought.

84
00:07:49,762 --> 00:07:51,896
I'll just pick up a boy
in the next town.

85
00:07:51,997 --> 00:07:54,464
Plenty would be glad
for such an opportunity.

86
00:07:54,566 --> 00:07:57,236
Yes, sir.
Anyway, thank you.

87
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:01,973
Wait a minute.
Come here.

88
00:08:04,508 --> 00:08:07,712
Just so's you and I part
the best of friends,

89
00:08:07,812 --> 00:08:10,647
here's a free pass
for tonight's performance.

90
00:08:10,749 --> 00:08:13,851
- But Mr. Tupper...
- Bring a friend
and enjoy yourself.

91
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:17,421
Courtesy of yours truly,
Harry Tupper.

92
00:08:17,521 --> 00:08:20,090
- Mr. Tupper...
- Farewell. Ice-cold lemonade.

93
00:08:20,191 --> 00:08:22,125
It's pink, it's cold,
it's refreshing.

94
00:08:22,227 --> 00:08:27,196
[Tupper] Ice-cold lemonade.
Pink and refreshing.
Ice-cold lemonade.

95
00:08:38,442 --> 00:08:41,344
Hey, Red.
Red, look at what I've got here.

96
00:08:41,444 --> 00:08:42,879
Look, Red.

97
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:44,481
Guess what this is.

98
00:08:44,581 --> 00:08:48,485
A genuine free pass
to the circus. Look.

99
00:08:48,585 --> 00:08:51,487
- [whinnies]
- Yahoo!

100
00:08:59,129 --> 00:09:01,264
Where have you been?

101
00:09:02,565 --> 00:09:06,468
I said where have you been?

102
00:09:06,569 --> 00:09:08,604
Answer me.

103
00:09:08,705 --> 00:09:10,538
I'm sorry, Uncle Daniel.

104
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,710
I meant to come right back,
but there was a parade.

105
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:17,779
And then I happened to go
by the circus grounds,

106
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,680
and a man gave me a free pass.

107
00:09:19,782 --> 00:09:22,184
- Look.
- Circus?

108
00:09:22,285 --> 00:09:24,419
Did you know the hogs
broke the fence down

109
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:28,124
because you didn't feed them
and rooted up the turnip field?

110
00:09:28,224 --> 00:09:30,557
Toby, we'd counted on
selling that crop.

111
00:09:30,659 --> 00:09:32,961
You know how we need money
in the house.

112
00:09:33,061 --> 00:09:36,965
- You're a shiftless,
ungrateful boy.
- Don't be hard on him.

113
00:09:37,065 --> 00:09:39,934
Boys get skittish
when a circus comes to town.

114
00:09:40,035 --> 00:09:42,803
He don't have a right
to behave like other boys.

115
00:09:42,905 --> 00:09:44,571
He's got no rights at all.

116
00:09:44,673 --> 00:09:47,141
- And he knows why.
- Don't say that to him.

117
00:09:47,243 --> 00:09:50,378
I'm a poor man, yet I took you
in out of decency's sake

118
00:09:50,478 --> 00:09:53,579
- when no one else
would have you.
- Daniel.

119
00:09:53,682 --> 00:09:58,552
I don't see why we didn't
send you to the county home
in the first place.

120
00:09:58,653 --> 00:10:02,522
You're no kin to us.
You're nothing to us.

121
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:06,026
Nothin' but a millstone
around our necks.

122
00:10:06,126 --> 00:10:08,862
You don't mean that, Daniel.

123
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:12,266
You just go up to bed
and stay there.

124
00:10:12,367 --> 00:10:15,534
There'll be no place
at supper for you.

125
00:10:35,922 --> 00:10:38,357
Those were cruel things to say.

126
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:40,926
Get on with the supper, Olive.

127
00:10:42,963 --> 00:10:44,830
[man] Hurry it up, Tupper.

128
00:10:44,931 --> 00:10:49,901
- This wagon's already loaded.
- [man #2] Gangway.
Horses coming through.

129
00:10:50,004 --> 00:10:53,805
- [man] Giddyup.
- [man #2] Move those
stringers out.

130
00:10:55,408 --> 00:10:57,143
Guy out over here.

131
00:10:57,243 --> 00:11:00,878
Men, guy out!
Over here!

132
00:11:00,981 --> 00:11:02,680
[Toby] Mr. Tupper?

133
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,319
Mr. Tupper?

134
00:11:07,419 --> 00:11:10,755
- Here I am, Mr. Tupper.
- Well, what of it?

135
00:11:10,855 --> 00:11:13,457
Don't you remember me,
Mr. Tupper?

136
00:11:14,494 --> 00:11:17,262
- You said I could work for you.
- So?

137
00:11:18,597 --> 00:11:22,100
- I'm ready.
- [man] Move it, move it!

138
00:11:22,201 --> 00:11:24,502
What about
that aunt and uncle?

139
00:11:24,603 --> 00:11:28,439
Well, it's all right.
They don't want me.

140
00:11:28,539 --> 00:11:31,542
They said I was a millstone
around their necks.

141
00:11:33,512 --> 00:11:35,612
All right,
you got the job.

142
00:11:35,713 --> 00:11:39,350
- Fifty cents a week.
- Today you said a dollar.

143
00:11:39,451 --> 00:11:41,984
If Harry Tupper said a dollar,
he meant a dollar.

144
00:11:42,087 --> 00:11:46,223
But don't let me catch you
running away once I teach you
the business.

145
00:11:46,324 --> 00:11:48,959
- It takes a lot out of me, boy.
- No, sir.

146
00:11:51,062 --> 00:11:54,331
Gentlemen's agreement.

147
00:11:54,433 --> 00:11:57,301
It's one of the most solemn
things there is. Understand?

148
00:11:57,401 --> 00:12:00,470
- Yes, sir.
- You stay here and
stay out of trouble.

149
00:12:00,571 --> 00:12:02,306
I'll be right back.

150
00:12:02,407 --> 00:12:04,140
- Mr. Tupper?
- Yes?

151
00:12:04,241 --> 00:12:06,310
- I'm hungry.
- So?

152
00:12:06,411 --> 00:12:10,347
I didn't have anything
to eat for supper.

153
00:12:10,448 --> 00:12:13,916
[sighing]
All right.

154
00:12:14,017 --> 00:12:17,652
[man]
Throw a blanket over the him!
He's coming down with a cold!

155
00:12:17,754 --> 00:12:20,890
There you are, my boy.
Nutritional gold
from the Indies.

156
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:24,561
- See that it lasts you
till morning.
- Yes, sir.

157
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:27,197
- [man] Give us
a hand, will you?
- [man #2] Up.

158
00:12:27,297 --> 00:12:28,664
[man] Olie!

159
00:12:28,764 --> 00:12:31,700
- [man #2] Chuck wagon ready.
- [man #3] Pull that back.

160
00:12:31,801 --> 00:12:34,769
[man #3] Get some of this stuff
back in there.

161
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:37,706
- [man] We're leavin', boys.
- [man #2] Lift it up.

162
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:42,744
- [man shouting]
- Steady up, boys. Steady.

163
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,647
Steady!

164
00:12:45,748 --> 00:12:48,283
[horse whinnying]

165
00:12:49,318 --> 00:12:51,720
[man]
Clear that... [indistinct]

166
00:12:53,255 --> 00:12:54,990
Hey!

167
00:12:58,327 --> 00:12:59,994
What are you doing?

168
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:08,570
- Give that back, you thief!
- [screeching]

169
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:14,808
[monkey screeching]

170
00:13:14,908 --> 00:13:17,646
What's going on?
What did you do to that chimp?

171
00:13:17,746 --> 00:13:21,581
Me? I didn't do a thing.
He stole my banana.

172
00:13:21,684 --> 00:13:24,185
[screeching]

173
00:13:25,586 --> 00:13:28,456
All right, troublemaker.
Settle down.

174
00:13:28,556 --> 00:13:32,259
Now, as for you,
you'd better get home.

175
00:13:33,127 --> 00:13:35,196
I told you
to stay out of trouble.

176
00:13:35,297 --> 00:13:37,664
He stole my banana.

177
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:43,036
- What's wrong here?
- I-I-I... Nothing, Colonel,
nothing at all.

178
00:13:43,136 --> 00:13:45,239
The chimp just got
a little excited.

179
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:48,475
- Who's this?
- This is my new helper, sir.

180
00:13:48,575 --> 00:13:51,911
- Picking them small,
aren't you?
- Well, sir...

181
00:13:53,481 --> 00:13:55,214
He has no folks,
the poor lad,

182
00:13:55,317 --> 00:13:58,851
and I thought I'd take him
under my wing and give him
a helping hand.

183
00:13:58,952 --> 00:14:01,353
Spare me your
kind intentions, Tupper.

184
00:14:01,455 --> 00:14:04,690
Get these wagons moving.
The boy can ride
up top with Ben.

185
00:14:04,792 --> 00:14:06,592
Thunderation, Colonel.

186
00:14:06,693 --> 00:14:09,395
Why pick me to wet-nurse
Tupper's sniveling brats?

187
00:14:09,497 --> 00:14:12,899
Trim your wagon, Ben.
We're moving.

188
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,734
Olie, get these sideboards up.

189
00:14:18,737 --> 00:14:21,507
- Mr. Tupper?
- Hmm?

190
00:14:21,608 --> 00:14:23,609
I kind of changed my mind.

191
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:26,345
Oh, now, lad.

192
00:14:26,446 --> 00:14:30,248
Listen. Don't you worry none
about our rough ways. No, sir.

193
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:33,819
We don't mean a thing by it.
Not a blessed thing. No, no.

194
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,589
Here, look. Look what
Mr. Tupper has here for you.

195
00:14:36,689 --> 00:14:40,092
There's a bag for you
of peppermint jaws.

196
00:14:40,192 --> 00:14:42,426
That should last you
till morning.

197
00:14:47,966 --> 00:14:51,068
All right, now, lad.
Right up this ladder here.

198
00:14:51,169 --> 00:14:54,272
I'll take that for you.
You'll be snug
as a mouse up there.

199
00:14:54,372 --> 00:14:56,841
Mr. Cotter will
take good care of you.

200
00:15:02,281 --> 00:15:05,815
[man] All right, keep them cats
covered when you move 'em!

201
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:11,921
Colonel Castle says you ride
with me, you ride.

202
00:15:12,022 --> 00:15:15,091
Get a tight tailhold
on yourself, sonny.

203
00:15:15,192 --> 00:15:18,229
Bess, Will, ha!

204
00:15:19,564 --> 00:15:21,732
Get. Giddap.

205
00:15:29,006 --> 00:15:30,741
Let's get
one thing straight.

206
00:15:30,841 --> 00:15:32,608
Me, I don't like kids.

207
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:36,747
Especially runaways.
They're a weak-livered lot.

208
00:15:36,846 --> 00:15:41,684
Kid has a good home.
First time something
goes wrong, he runs away.

209
00:15:41,786 --> 00:15:44,587
Then he finds things
don't suit him just right.

210
00:15:44,688 --> 00:15:47,222
He wants to run
back home again.

211
00:15:52,228 --> 00:15:55,129
Go ahead. Jump.
Nobody'll miss you.

212
00:15:55,231 --> 00:15:57,966
I doubt you're worth missing.

213
00:15:58,067 --> 00:16:00,102
Jump. Don't be scared.

214
00:16:00,203 --> 00:16:03,272
I'm not scared.

215
00:16:04,408 --> 00:16:06,875
And I'm not scared
of you either.

216
00:16:07,977 --> 00:16:10,244
Fair enough, sonny.

217
00:16:10,347 --> 00:16:13,648
My name isn't Sonny.
It's Toby Tyler.

218
00:16:13,749 --> 00:16:16,618
All right, sonny.
We'll call you Toby.

219
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,688
Now, it's none
of my business, Toby,

220
00:16:19,789 --> 00:16:21,923
but maybe you better
catch some sleep.

221
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:23,792
Morning comes early
with this outfit.

222
00:16:23,891 --> 00:16:26,894
- I'm not sleepy.
- Suit yourself.

223
00:16:29,097 --> 00:16:34,569

00:16:58,493 --> 00:17:00,960
Ho there.
Get up, get up.

00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:02,428
<i> Not too sad </i>

232
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:06,366

<i> It's better not knowin'

235
00:17:43,136 --> 00:17:48,341
You better be up and doin',
before Harry Tupper
comes for you.

236
00:17:48,441 --> 00:17:50,775
Thanks for taking care of me
last night, Ben.

237
00:17:50,877 --> 00:17:54,480
- I guess I fell asleep.
- Don't mean nothin' to me.

238
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:57,782
I didn't want you fallin' off
the wagon and me getting blamed.

239
00:17:57,885 --> 00:17:59,952
Anyway, thanks.

240
00:18:00,052 --> 00:18:02,153
I won't bother you anymore.

241
00:18:02,254 --> 00:18:05,091
I'm sure glad to hear that.

242
00:18:06,993 --> 00:18:08,927
[spitting]

243
00:18:09,028 --> 00:18:12,463
[screeching]

244
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,642
[man] Get Mrs. Connor
and a couple of girls
to look at this canvas.

245
00:18:40,992 --> 00:18:43,827
For a big fella he sure throws
a puny shadow, don't he?

246
00:18:43,928 --> 00:18:46,630
- He sure does.
- Reckon I ought to tell him

247
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:48,899
his apron strings
is draggin'?

248
00:18:56,408 --> 00:18:58,241
I didn't say nothin'.

249
00:19:05,615 --> 00:19:08,717
[man] Hey, Dots,
you seen our stake wagon?

250
00:19:11,756 --> 00:19:15,491
- Should I wash up here?
- That's water, ain't it?

251
00:19:15,591 --> 00:19:17,794
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

252
00:19:17,894 --> 00:19:21,529
Now you do me a favor
and keep out of my way.

253
00:19:34,778 --> 00:19:38,480
- What's the matter?
- You sure got
a bad temper, mister.

254
00:19:38,581 --> 00:19:41,583
Don't let that bother you.
You're working for Harry Tupper.

255
00:19:41,684 --> 00:19:45,087
- A real fine fellow.
- At least he's friendly.

256
00:19:45,187 --> 00:19:47,356
Oh, sure.

257
00:19:51,327 --> 00:19:55,663
And just by happenstance,
here's Mr. Friendly himself,

258
00:19:55,763 --> 00:19:57,431
come looking for you.

259
00:20:01,604 --> 00:20:04,338
What's the idea of making me
chase all over for you?

260
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,574
Morning, Mr. Tupper.
I was just washing up.

261
00:20:07,676 --> 00:20:11,612
Not on my time, you aren't.
Come on.

262
00:20:11,713 --> 00:20:15,282
Come on.
Move along, move along.

263
00:20:15,384 --> 00:20:17,985
Come on.
Step it along.

264
00:20:18,852 --> 00:20:21,721
[sighing]

265
00:20:23,724 --> 00:20:26,459
Look. We don't want to be
wool-gathering all over camp

266
00:20:26,561 --> 00:20:28,928
when there's work
to be done, do we?

267
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,867
Now, let's move along, boy.
Let's...

268
00:20:35,436 --> 00:20:38,771
- Put me down!
- No, Ben, it was my fault.

269
00:20:38,872 --> 00:20:42,342
You keep out of this, boy.
It's got nothin' to do with you.

270
00:20:42,443 --> 00:20:45,011
Take your dirty hands
off of me.

271
00:20:45,112 --> 00:20:48,881
Oh, I aim to, Mr. Tupper.
I aim to.

272
00:20:48,982 --> 00:20:52,252
Now, I don't believe
in coddling, Mr. Tupper,

273
00:20:52,353 --> 00:20:56,123
but I got my fill of you
mistreating your helpers.

274
00:20:56,223 --> 00:20:58,524
It just don't
sit well with me.

275
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:01,494
That boy works for me, and
I'll do what I want with him.

276
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:04,729
Sure, Mr. Tupper.
You just tell him
what you want him to do.

277
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,167
If he don't do it,
you can fire him.

278
00:21:07,268 --> 00:21:10,703
But if I ever catch you
mistreating him again,

279
00:21:10,803 --> 00:21:14,606
well, I'm just liable
to do something like this.

280
00:21:14,707 --> 00:21:16,741
No, Ben, no!

281
00:21:27,553 --> 00:21:29,755
As for you,
you listen to Mr. Tupper.

282
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:33,691
Work hard and do your job right.
He's your employer.
You be respectful.

283
00:21:33,794 --> 00:21:35,526
Yes, sir.

284
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:39,431
You can work soon as
you've had breakfast.
Cookhouse is down there.

285
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:42,800
Well?

286
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:50,008
Why, Mr. Tupper,
you're all wet.

287
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:52,243
Here.

288
00:21:53,379 --> 00:21:57,416
<i> A biddle-dee-dee
and a biddle-dee-do </i>

289
00:21:57,516 --> 00:22:01,586
<i>[humming]
 Away I go </i>

290
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:07,725
- There you are.
- Thanks.

291
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:21,071
[Jeanette]
Why don't you sit here?

292
00:22:22,406 --> 00:22:25,542
Oh, thank you.

293
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:39,122
- You're new around here,
aren't you?
- Yes, ma'am.

294
00:22:54,237 --> 00:22:57,640
- Who's that?
- I was just trying to find out.

295
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:01,075
You're not supposed to be here.
This is a performer's table.

296
00:23:01,178 --> 00:23:03,379
Stop it, Ajax.
I asked him to sit down.

297
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:07,849
Did you hear what I said?
And look at me
when I talk to you!

298
00:23:07,949 --> 00:23:10,085
[Jeanette] Oh, Ajax,
let him alone.

299
00:23:10,186 --> 00:23:12,687
[Ajax] He's not supposed
to be at our table.

300
00:23:13,622 --> 00:23:15,423
Go on. Get away.

301
00:23:19,127 --> 00:23:21,263
Well, well,
there you are, my boy.

302
00:23:21,363 --> 00:23:24,499
Colonel Castle 'specially
asked me to look out for you.

303
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,735
- Me?
- Are you taking a professional
nom de plume this season,

304
00:23:28,837 --> 00:23:31,172
or do you plan
to use your own name?

305
00:23:31,272 --> 00:23:33,641
- I guess I'll use my own name.
- Which is?

306
00:23:33,742 --> 00:23:36,477
- Toby Tyler.
- Of course. Wonderful name.

307
00:23:36,579 --> 00:23:38,479
I've always liked it.

308
00:23:38,581 --> 00:23:42,016
May I present Mademoiselle
Jeanette and Monsieur Ajax?

309
00:23:42,116 --> 00:23:45,119
You're heard
of Toby Tyler, of course.

310
00:23:45,221 --> 00:23:48,154
Well, gosh,
I didn't know who he was.

311
00:23:48,256 --> 00:23:50,925
It's a little late
for apologies.

312
00:23:51,025 --> 00:23:53,860
Will you have breakfast
with my family and me?

313
00:23:53,962 --> 00:23:56,263
- Yes, sir.
- Fine. Right this way.

314
00:24:01,168 --> 00:24:05,071
Allow me to introduce myself.
I'm Sam Treat, circus clown.

315
00:24:05,172 --> 00:24:08,609
- A clown!
- At your service.

316
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:10,143
Ow.

317
00:24:12,513 --> 00:24:15,848
[with accent]
What is it that you do
with the circus, Mr. Tyler?

318
00:24:15,949 --> 00:24:20,153
Oh, I'm a con...
con-stash-in-aire.

319
00:24:20,255 --> 00:24:23,523
A con-stash-in-aire?
[laughing]

320
00:24:23,625 --> 00:24:27,826
Papa Schultz used to say,
"What would a circus be
without a con-stash-inaire?"

321
00:24:27,927 --> 00:24:30,129
[chuckling]

322
00:24:30,231 --> 00:24:34,234
Come on. The kids are sure
gonna be glad to meet you.

323
00:24:34,334 --> 00:24:37,103
- How big of a family
do you have?
- It depends.

324
00:24:37,203 --> 00:24:40,938
Most of the time I'd say
somewhere between four and five.

325
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:44,075
- Sit down.
- Thanks.

326
00:24:52,251 --> 00:24:55,321
All right, kids.
Breakfast.

327
00:25:10,269 --> 00:25:13,704
Gosh, when you said you had
a family, I thought that you...

328
00:25:13,806 --> 00:25:16,941
It's all right.
They're family to me.

329
00:25:17,041 --> 00:25:18,743
Not what you're used to,
I suppose.

330
00:25:18,844 --> 00:25:22,513
To tell you the truth, I don't
have a regular family either.

331
00:25:22,614 --> 00:25:25,115
That's why I joined the circus.

332
00:25:25,216 --> 00:25:28,251
- That so?
- I ran away, you know.

333
00:25:28,354 --> 00:25:32,556
- I never would have guessed.
- It wasn't because
they didn't want me,

334
00:25:32,657 --> 00:25:36,394
but they're awful poor,
and I was a millstone
around their necks.

335
00:25:36,494 --> 00:25:38,562
Millstone, huh?
That's pretty bad.

336
00:25:38,663 --> 00:25:40,531
Sure is.

337
00:25:40,632 --> 00:25:43,366
You, uh, you figure
you'll ever go back?

338
00:25:43,468 --> 00:25:45,436
I guess not.

339
00:25:45,537 --> 00:25:48,439
Not till I can earn
enough money to bring home,

340
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,773
to show them I'm not
what they said I was.

341
00:25:50,874 --> 00:25:55,145
You know,
Papa Schultz used to say,

342
00:25:55,245 --> 00:25:57,748
[with accent] "Happiness
you should spend around,

343
00:25:57,848 --> 00:26:00,249
<i>und it will come back
even more so.</i>

344
00:26:00,351 --> 00:26:03,919
Money you should
save in something."

345
00:26:05,255 --> 00:26:08,991
- Who was Papa Schultz?
- An old clown I used to know.

346
00:26:09,092 --> 00:26:11,793
I always wanted to make
people happy, the way he did.

347
00:26:11,895 --> 00:26:15,297
- That's why I ran away
with the circus.
- You ran away too?

348
00:26:17,199 --> 00:26:19,501
Papa gave me this pouch
to save money in.

349
00:26:19,603 --> 00:26:24,874
<i>He said, "The circus is
for elephants und Papa Schultz.</i>

350
00:26:24,974 --> 00:26:27,577
Everybody else should
take their money and go home."

351
00:26:27,678 --> 00:26:29,310
But you didn't.

352
00:26:31,481 --> 00:26:33,482
There you are, Toby.

353
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:38,420
Save your money.
Don't wait till it's too late.

354
00:26:38,521 --> 00:26:40,122
Thank you, Mr. Treat.

355
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:42,457
I'll save all my money
and work hard

356
00:26:42,558 --> 00:26:45,494
and do everything
Mr. Tupper tells me, and...

357
00:26:45,595 --> 00:26:48,128
- Oh, my gosh!
- What's the matter?

358
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:50,965
I forgot.
Mr. Tupper's waiting for me.

359
00:26:51,834 --> 00:26:53,602
Bye. Bye.

360
00:26:53,703 --> 00:26:55,937
Bye. Come back again.

361
00:26:57,006 --> 00:26:59,139
[whistle blows]

362
00:27:02,445 --> 00:27:06,448
- Peanuts, popcorn,
candied apples.
- [crowd gasping]

363
00:27:13,121 --> 00:27:14,789
[Tupper] Peanuts!

364
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:18,224
Peanuts, popcorn,
candied apples.

365
00:27:18,326 --> 00:27:22,396
Peanuts, popcorn,
candied apples.

366
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:26,634
All right, folks.
Right here, ice-cold lemonade.
It's refreshing.

367
00:27:32,473 --> 00:27:36,710
Candied apples,
peanuts, popcorn.

368
00:27:39,379 --> 00:27:41,781
[crowd gasping]

369
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:30,863
- [cymbals crash]
- [horn toots]

370
00:29:08,433 --> 00:29:11,636
Peanuts, popcorn,
candied apples.

371
00:29:13,872 --> 00:29:18,074
- [drumroll]
- And now, ladies and gentlemen,

372
00:29:18,175 --> 00:29:20,777
you are about to witness

373
00:29:20,878 --> 00:29:24,681
those youthful
equestrians extraordinaire,

374
00:29:24,782 --> 00:29:28,919
with their famous
educated steeds.

375
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,853
Mademoiselle Jeanette

376
00:29:30,955 --> 00:29:33,189
and Monsieur Ajax.

377
00:29:50,107 --> 00:29:53,175
Peanuts, popcorn,
candied apples.

378
00:29:53,276 --> 00:29:55,511
Peanuts...

379
00:29:55,612 --> 00:29:57,746
Hey, sit down, boy,
will you?

380
00:29:57,847 --> 00:30:00,215
Oh, thank you, sir.

381
00:30:29,945 --> 00:30:32,814
[whistle blowing]

382
00:30:50,698 --> 00:30:54,268
Ice-cold lemonade.
It's pink, cold and refreshing.

383
00:31:17,724 --> 00:31:21,528
- Great show, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.

384
00:31:27,233 --> 00:31:30,002
Peanuts, popcorn,
candied apples.

385
00:31:30,103 --> 00:31:33,739
Ice-cold lemonade here.
It's pink, it's cold.

386
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,408
A dollar, thirty,
thirty-five, forty,

387
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:38,177
sixty, sixty-five...

388
00:31:38,979 --> 00:31:40,780
What's that?

389
00:31:41,648 --> 00:31:43,783
Why, you blithering
greenhorn.

390
00:31:43,884 --> 00:31:46,652
Don't you know any better
than to take a lead slug?

391
00:31:46,753 --> 00:31:50,989
I'm sorry, Mr. Tupper.
I don't know that much
about money.

392
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:53,725
Oh, you don't?
Oh, then, I'll teach you.

393
00:31:53,827 --> 00:31:55,459
Here is lesson number one.

394
00:31:55,562 --> 00:31:59,363
I'm going to replace
this slug with a nickel
from your first week's pay.

395
00:31:59,464 --> 00:32:01,499
Yes, sir.

396
00:32:01,601 --> 00:32:04,170
What do I do with these?

397
00:32:04,269 --> 00:32:07,037
- Where did you get them?
- They were left over.

398
00:32:07,139 --> 00:32:11,109
When I tried to give them back,
they said, "Keep the change."

399
00:32:14,478 --> 00:32:18,683
That, my lad, is what is known
in circus parlance as "a tip."

400
00:32:18,784 --> 00:32:20,351
- Understand?
- No.

401
00:32:20,451 --> 00:32:22,220
Good.

402
00:32:22,321 --> 00:32:24,554
There's an old circus custom

403
00:32:24,656 --> 00:32:27,759
that all tips belong
to the head concessionaire.

404
00:32:27,859 --> 00:32:29,960
- That's me.
- Yes, sir.

405
00:32:30,061 --> 00:32:33,130
However, if you report
all your tips,

406
00:32:33,232 --> 00:32:34,899
I will split them
with you.

407
00:32:34,999 --> 00:32:38,501
Thus, a dime for me
and a nickel for you.

408
00:32:38,603 --> 00:32:40,037
Thank you, sir.

409
00:32:40,137 --> 00:32:45,109
But you must promise to keep
our little arrangement a secret.

410
00:32:47,879 --> 00:32:51,749
You see, in the circus world,
one must pretend to have
a hard nature.

411
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:55,119
I wouldn't want folks
to think that I was a softie.

412
00:32:57,687 --> 00:32:59,890
Now, get busy
and clean up that mess.

413
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:49,662
[screeching]

414
00:34:56,736 --> 00:35:00,006
[jabbering]

415
00:35:01,342 --> 00:35:03,943
Why, you little...

416
00:35:04,044 --> 00:35:07,012
Mr. Tupper'll
skin me alive.

417
00:35:08,982 --> 00:35:11,250
I hope you get sick!

418
00:35:13,586 --> 00:35:17,089
I hope you get so sick
that you turn green.

419
00:35:17,191 --> 00:35:19,425
[screeching]

420
00:35:24,197 --> 00:35:26,599
[yowling]

421
00:35:28,301 --> 00:35:30,835
[whimpering]

422
00:35:30,936 --> 00:35:35,172
- He's awful sick, isn't he?
- It don't look too good,
that's a fact.

423
00:35:35,274 --> 00:35:37,241
It's all my fault.

424
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:39,378
I didn't want him
to get that sick.

425
00:35:39,477 --> 00:35:43,381
This fellow'll eat anything.
Sometimes I think
he's part ostrich.

426
00:35:44,383 --> 00:35:46,517
Let's see here.

427
00:35:51,123 --> 00:35:53,091
A trunk key.

428
00:35:57,862 --> 00:35:59,830
A button hook.

429
00:36:07,471 --> 00:36:09,673
A hairbrush?

430
00:36:18,916 --> 00:36:22,285
- A piece of clothesline.
- You sure scared me.

431
00:36:22,386 --> 00:36:25,256
Don't worry about this fellow.
You couldn't hurt him...

432
00:36:25,356 --> 00:36:29,624
He is almost indestruct...
Indestructible.

433
00:36:29,726 --> 00:36:33,430
- You couldn't do it.
- Do you think
you can fix him up?

434
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:36,032
I always have.

435
00:36:36,834 --> 00:36:39,701
Old reliable.
Castor oil.

436
00:36:48,912 --> 00:36:51,448
Get a good grip on him,
and I'll give him some.

437
00:36:51,548 --> 00:36:53,748
Gosh, I wanted to
make friends with him.

438
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:55,884
He'll never
forgive me for this.

439
00:36:55,986 --> 00:36:59,054
Hang on tight.
Don't let him bite.

440
00:37:01,224 --> 00:37:04,093
- There we are.
- [screeching]

441
00:37:04,194 --> 00:37:07,261
- Hold still.
- [screeching]

442
00:37:07,363 --> 00:37:10,933
- [screeching]
- Easy, easy.

443
00:37:11,034 --> 00:37:13,334
Hold him tight.

444
00:37:17,773 --> 00:37:21,043
I sure hate to put him back
in that old monkey cage.

445
00:37:21,144 --> 00:37:24,078
It might be a good idea
to keep him warm tonight.

446
00:37:24,179 --> 00:37:26,647
Here. Wrap him in this.

447
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:32,253
Maybe he can sleep
with me tonight.

448
00:37:32,353 --> 00:37:35,157
You better ask Ben. The monks
are his responsibility.

449
00:37:35,257 --> 00:37:37,691
Thanks, Mr. Treat.

450
00:37:37,791 --> 00:37:39,727
Good night.

451
00:37:43,197 --> 00:37:46,667
We're gonna be
real good friends now,
aren't we, Mr. Stubbs?

452
00:37:46,768 --> 00:37:48,968
Stubbs?
Why Mr. Stubbs?

453
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:52,372
He reminds me
of old Mr. Stubbs.

454
00:37:52,473 --> 00:37:56,210
He runs the general store
back home.

455
00:37:56,310 --> 00:38:00,380
Yes, sir, real good friends.
That's gonna be us, Mr. Stubbs.

456
00:38:00,481 --> 00:38:04,616
How I ever let you sweet-talk me
into this, I don't know.

457
00:38:04,718 --> 00:38:07,054
Colonel Castle's
number one rule is:

458
00:38:07,155 --> 00:38:09,889
"Animals ride in the cages
where they belong."

459
00:38:11,625 --> 00:38:13,992
Don't you think
he's looking better?

460
00:38:14,094 --> 00:38:18,398
- He'll be his old self
in the morning.
- That'll be real nice.

461
00:38:18,499 --> 00:38:20,333
Giddap! Ha!

462
00:38:39,486 --> 00:38:41,353
Wake up, Toby.
Wake up.

463
00:38:41,455 --> 00:38:45,458
- What time is it?
- Late. Canvas wagon
had a breakdown.

464
00:38:45,559 --> 00:38:47,593
Maybe I ought
to find Mr. Tupper.

465
00:38:47,693 --> 00:38:49,627
- He'll be lookin' for me.
- Hold on.

466
00:38:49,728 --> 00:38:52,598
We're gonna parade
into Woodvale.
We'll set canvas after.

467
00:38:52,699 --> 00:38:55,501
- You mean I get
to ride in a parade?
- Yeah.

468
00:38:55,601 --> 00:38:58,236
Here.
You want to be circus?

469
00:38:58,337 --> 00:39:00,406
Look circus.

470
00:39:00,506 --> 00:39:04,110
- How about a hat
for Mr. Stubbs?
- Never mind about that.

471
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:06,044
Whatever you do,
hang onto that chimp.

472
00:39:06,145 --> 00:39:08,746
Don't you think
he's looking better, Ben?

473
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:10,181
Yeah.

474
00:39:10,282 --> 00:39:12,917
- [popping]
- Hey, I almost forgot.

475
00:39:13,018 --> 00:39:16,154
It's the Fourth of July.
That means firecrackers.

476
00:39:16,255 --> 00:39:19,423
Uh-huh. The big cats
are sure gonna love them.

477
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:22,159
Ha. Giddyup.

478
00:39:22,261 --> 00:39:25,295
[brass band playing]

479
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:32,869
[roaring]

480
00:39:40,512 --> 00:39:42,912
[Ben]
Bess, Will, steady now!

481
00:39:53,056 --> 00:39:56,860
Hold up!
Bess, Will, whoa!

482
00:39:58,763 --> 00:40:00,764
Stop, you consarn...

483
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:02,998
Jump, Toby, jump!

484
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:06,803
[screaming]

485
00:40:06,903 --> 00:40:09,238
[man] There's a kid
under that wagon.

486
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,507
Get that kid out of there.
Look out!

487
00:40:11,608 --> 00:40:13,942
Look out! Look out!

488
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:16,678
Call an ambulance, someone!

489
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:27,155
- Toby, you all right?
- Yeah, sure.

490
00:40:27,256 --> 00:40:29,559
Thanks, boys.

491
00:40:31,427 --> 00:40:33,528
- How did this happen?
- Chimp was loose,

492
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:35,497
got scared
and riled the horses.

493
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:40,336
- How'd the chimp get loose?
- My fault. He was
up top with me.

494
00:40:40,437 --> 00:40:42,537
You know the rules, Ben.
You're through.

495
00:40:42,638 --> 00:40:44,872
See me after the show.

496
00:40:44,973 --> 00:40:46,774
[Colonel] The monkeys!

497
00:40:46,875 --> 00:40:51,279
Olie, Omaha, get after
those monks before they
tear this town apart.

498
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:54,450
Mr. Stubbs. He's loose.

499
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:57,285
Keep those wagons moving.
Close it up.

500
00:40:57,385 --> 00:41:00,054
- [brass band playing]
- Mr. Stubbs!

501
00:41:13,768 --> 00:41:17,539
[gunshots]

502
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:19,106
Take cover!

503
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:52,171
[gunshot]

504
00:41:55,642 --> 00:42:01,080
[jabbering, screeching]

505
00:42:02,816 --> 00:42:05,617
Hey, son, get down.
That chimp in there's
got my .45.

506
00:42:05,719 --> 00:42:07,987
Mr. Stubbs!

507
00:42:08,087 --> 00:42:10,389
Get back down there.

508
00:42:18,299 --> 00:42:20,399
He's got
just one more shot.

509
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,100
[gunshot]

510
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:27,972
Rest easy, folks.
That's the last bullet.

511
00:42:35,114 --> 00:42:37,349
[gunshot]

512
00:42:43,923 --> 00:42:46,156
Sheriff.

513
00:42:50,094 --> 00:42:52,129
- Wait!
- Get back!

514
00:42:52,229 --> 00:42:55,132
Hate to do this, but I'll get
him before he shoots someone.

515
00:42:55,233 --> 00:42:58,402
- No!
- Hey, come back here!

516
00:43:01,973 --> 00:43:04,742
Oh, hi, Mr. Stubbs.

517
00:43:07,245 --> 00:43:09,814
It's me, Toby.

518
00:43:09,913 --> 00:43:12,382
Look out, boy.
Don't rile him.

519
00:43:12,483 --> 00:43:15,418
- [gunshot]
- Oh, horrible!

520
00:43:20,991 --> 00:43:24,293
We're friends,
Mr. Stubbs, remember?

521
00:43:26,831 --> 00:43:29,098
Careful with that gun.

522
00:43:35,172 --> 00:43:38,708
Good old boy.
Easy.

523
00:43:38,809 --> 00:43:43,246
Easy, Mr. Stubbs.
Good old boy.

524
00:43:44,714 --> 00:43:47,717
Good old Mr. Stubbs.

525
00:43:47,818 --> 00:43:50,018
Easy.

526
00:43:53,890 --> 00:43:56,859
Give it to me. Please?

527
00:44:01,431 --> 00:44:04,266
No, Mr. Stubbs! No!

528
00:44:05,802 --> 00:44:08,570
Mr. Stubbs!

529
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:12,072
Too late to be sorry now.
Come on.

530
00:44:19,883 --> 00:44:22,717
He didn't know
it was loaded.

531
00:44:22,819 --> 00:44:25,421
That chimp's pretty good
with a shooting iron.

532
00:44:25,521 --> 00:44:29,056
- Yeah, maybe you ought
to deputize him.
- [laughing]

533
00:44:41,937 --> 00:44:44,038
- Where are you going?
- Taking a walk.

534
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:45,673
Free country.

535
00:44:45,773 --> 00:44:47,841
- Where are you going?
- Leaving.

536
00:44:47,943 --> 00:44:51,878
Planning on buying
that livery stable
you've been thinking about?

537
00:44:51,979 --> 00:44:53,880
Might.

538
00:44:55,016 --> 00:44:57,416
Well, good luck.

539
00:44:57,519 --> 00:44:59,587
[Colonel]
Come in, come in.

540
00:45:03,625 --> 00:45:06,726
Why doesn't Ben just
tell him it was my fault?

541
00:45:07,563 --> 00:45:09,796
You know why Ben's so big?

542
00:45:11,098 --> 00:45:14,200
He's just plain stuffed
with mulehead pride.

543
00:45:14,301 --> 00:45:18,236
Well, Ben,
it's been quite a day.

544
00:45:18,339 --> 00:45:23,176
Those runaway monks fiascoed us
into the best business
we've done all season.

545
00:45:23,277 --> 00:45:25,311
Telegraph from our man
in Kingsville

546
00:45:25,411 --> 00:45:28,748
says they're sold out of "blues"
for the performance tomorrow.

547
00:45:28,849 --> 00:45:31,048
And listen to this.

548
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,654
"Monkeys capture Woodvale.

549
00:45:34,754 --> 00:45:37,590
Boy disarms
gun-toting chimpanzee.

550
00:45:37,691 --> 00:45:41,125
Animals celebrate
Independence Day
by making break for freedom."

551
00:45:41,228 --> 00:45:45,264
That busted wagon was the best
thing that ever happened to us.

552
00:45:46,666 --> 00:45:49,201
Why the getup?
You trying to scare the animals?

553
00:45:49,302 --> 00:45:51,436
I come by
to pick up my pay, Colonel.

554
00:45:51,538 --> 00:45:54,706
- Your pay? What for?
- You fired me today.

555
00:45:54,808 --> 00:45:57,442
Oh, now, Ben.
You know me.

556
00:45:57,544 --> 00:45:59,711
I was just letting out
a little steam.

557
00:45:59,813 --> 00:46:01,713
What's the sense
of running my show

558
00:46:01,815 --> 00:46:03,816
if I can't get sore
at people?

559
00:46:03,916 --> 00:46:05,884
If you'll pay me
the money that's due.

560
00:46:05,985 --> 00:46:09,086
Stop whimpering
about your money.
Where's that boy, Tyler?

561
00:46:09,187 --> 00:46:12,023
Toby? He's outside.

562
00:46:12,123 --> 00:46:15,627
- What's he got to do with this?
- Toby?

563
00:46:15,728 --> 00:46:17,996
Toby Tyler, come in here.

564
00:46:23,636 --> 00:46:26,737
Now, Toby, I want you
and the chimpanzee

565
00:46:26,838 --> 00:46:29,239
to ride up
on the monkey cage tomorrow.

566
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:32,544
Folks in Kingsville
want to look you over
after those stories.

567
00:46:32,644 --> 00:46:35,311
A chimp up on the seat?
Are you out of your mind?

568
00:46:35,414 --> 00:46:36,980
That's what started the fracas.

569
00:46:37,081 --> 00:46:39,782
With you in charge,
I'm not worried about a thing.

570
00:46:39,884 --> 00:46:43,620
Oh, no. No, sir. You don't
get around me that way.

571
00:46:43,721 --> 00:46:47,123
Toby, I'd like
to thank you for saving
that chimp's life today.

572
00:46:47,224 --> 00:46:49,259
He's kind of
a pet of mine.

573
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:51,428
I've got a weakness
for troublemakers.

574
00:46:51,529 --> 00:46:54,665
- That's why I like
old Ben here.
- Colonel...

575
00:46:54,766 --> 00:46:56,933
Seems like you handle
that chimp pretty well.

576
00:46:57,035 --> 00:47:01,572
How'd you like
to take care of him?
Keep him out of mischief?

577
00:47:01,673 --> 00:47:05,042
- You mean it, sir?
- He's your responsibility.

578
00:47:05,141 --> 00:47:06,943
Now, run along.

579
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:10,079
Thank you, sir.

580
00:47:10,181 --> 00:47:12,848
Look, Colonel, I don't
think this is gonna work.

581
00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:15,384
What are you standing
around here for?

582
00:47:15,485 --> 00:47:18,153
Climb out of that suit
and get those wagons moving.

583
00:47:18,254 --> 00:47:20,723
It's a long haul
to Kingsville.

584
00:47:26,862 --> 00:47:29,097
Welcome home, Ben.

585
00:47:39,776 --> 00:47:41,744
- Where have you been?
- I was...

586
00:47:41,845 --> 00:47:44,545
I don't care what Colonel Castle
says about that chimp.

587
00:47:44,647 --> 00:47:47,883
You just be sure he doesn't
interfere with your work.

588
00:47:47,984 --> 00:47:50,785
I have to go into town
on some business.

589
00:47:50,886 --> 00:47:53,255
- You remember
everything I told you?
- Yes, sir.

590
00:47:53,355 --> 00:47:56,357
See that all the stock
is locked in the green box,

591
00:47:56,457 --> 00:47:58,759
fetch enough water
for all the jars,

592
00:47:58,861 --> 00:48:01,997
and it's Saturday.

593
00:48:02,098 --> 00:48:05,366
- Saturday?
- Yes, sir. The day you pay me.

594
00:48:12,641 --> 00:48:15,443
And what, young Croesus,
are you doing with the money

595
00:48:15,544 --> 00:48:18,679
I've been showering down on you
the past couple of weeks?

596
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:20,949
Oh, I save it, sir.

597
00:48:22,350 --> 00:48:25,085
That's a slug,
Mr. Tupper.

598
00:48:30,959 --> 00:48:35,227
So it is. Just wanted to see
if you were on your toes.

599
00:48:36,130 --> 00:48:38,097
Here you are.

600
00:48:38,198 --> 00:48:41,934
You make sure that chimp
stays out of my stock box.

601
00:48:43,336 --> 00:48:45,437
I won't be gone long,

602
00:48:45,539 --> 00:48:48,940
and I want you to carry on
with your work.

603
00:48:49,043 --> 00:48:50,877
Yes, sir.

604
00:48:53,114 --> 00:48:56,749
You ever see so much money
in your life, Mr. Stubbs?

605
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:59,185
Three dollars and 47 cents.

606
00:48:59,286 --> 00:49:01,452
I'm pretty near rich.

607
00:49:01,555 --> 00:49:05,324
Won't Uncle Daniel
be surprised when I bring
all this money home.

608
00:49:05,425 --> 00:49:07,426
Come on.
I better tie you up.

609
00:49:07,526 --> 00:49:10,328
Let's go.
I've got to go tie you up.

610
00:49:11,364 --> 00:49:13,932
Stay there.
Now, don't move.

611
00:49:14,768 --> 00:49:16,703
Here we go.

612
00:49:16,804 --> 00:49:19,270
Come on.
Here we go.

613
00:49:21,074 --> 00:49:23,875
Sit down.

614
00:49:23,975 --> 00:49:28,045
I got a lot of chores to do.
I'd better get started.

615
00:49:55,741 --> 00:49:57,541
Hello. Come in.

616
00:50:01,848 --> 00:50:03,513
Come on in.

617
00:50:11,522 --> 00:50:14,224
Well, if it isn't
the great peanut salesman.

618
00:50:14,324 --> 00:50:17,860
The death-defying daredevil
of the lemonade stand.

619
00:50:17,963 --> 00:50:21,398
Stop it, Ajax. We haven't
seen you around lately.

620
00:50:21,499 --> 00:50:24,134
Well, Mr. Tupper
kind of keeps me going.

621
00:50:24,235 --> 00:50:27,003
Oh, sure.
He's got an important job.

622
00:50:27,104 --> 00:50:30,941
- Chasing flies away
from the lemonade.
- Don't mind him, Toby.

623
00:50:31,041 --> 00:50:35,578
Oh, I don't. Next to Mr. Tupper,
he's kind of friendly.

624
00:50:35,679 --> 00:50:38,848
- That sure is a pretty horse.
- You like horses?

625
00:50:38,949 --> 00:50:41,550
What would a peanut seller
know about horses?

626
00:50:41,652 --> 00:50:44,587
- Hey, Jeanette, watch this.
- Oh.

627
00:50:44,687 --> 00:50:47,389
I do so know something
about horses.

628
00:50:47,490 --> 00:50:49,892
It so happens
I have a horse of my own.

629
00:50:49,993 --> 00:50:52,895
- Toby, really?
- His name's Old Red.

630
00:50:52,996 --> 00:50:56,165
Of course, he isn't really old.
That's just his name.

631
00:50:56,266 --> 00:50:59,068
- Is he a gaited horse?
- Gaited?

632
00:50:59,170 --> 00:51:01,770
You know, what gait
does he favor most?

633
00:51:01,871 --> 00:51:05,874
Oh, I guess he favors most
the gate that leads down
to the pasture.

634
00:51:05,975 --> 00:51:10,813
- Lots of sweet clover
down there.
- Toby, you're joking.

635
00:51:10,913 --> 00:51:14,115
Hey, Jeanette.
Look at me.

636
00:51:16,152 --> 00:51:18,854
- That's pretty good.
- Don't look at him.

637
00:51:18,954 --> 00:51:23,225
He thinks whenever he's
in that ring the whole world
has to stop and watch.

638
00:51:28,096 --> 00:51:30,865
Tell me some more
about Old Red. Can he jump?

639
00:51:30,966 --> 00:51:32,867
Hey, Jeanette!

640
00:51:32,968 --> 00:51:36,738
Ajax, you know
what the colonel said about
practicing without the belt.

641
00:51:36,839 --> 00:51:39,640
Who cares?
Just keep watching.

642
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:41,475
Ajax.

643
00:51:44,847 --> 00:51:46,881
[screaming]

644
00:51:48,817 --> 00:51:51,117
- Ajax.
- Get away from me.

645
00:52:00,362 --> 00:52:04,365
- It's pretty bad.
- Get him to his tent. Move.

646
00:52:04,466 --> 00:52:06,967
Careful of that leg.
Both hands under it.

647
00:52:07,068 --> 00:52:10,971
Easy, easy.
Get the doctor, quick.

648
00:52:11,072 --> 00:52:14,840
Who's responsible for this?
Who let him practice
without the belt?

649
00:52:14,942 --> 00:52:16,910
- Where were you?
- I was out...

650
00:52:17,011 --> 00:52:19,611
Never mind.
Don't bother me
with it now.

651
00:52:19,712 --> 00:52:21,313
Now what?

652
00:52:21,414 --> 00:52:25,885
Here we are, going into
our peak time, and a top act
goes up the chimney.

653
00:52:25,987 --> 00:52:28,354
Well, what do we
do about it?

654
00:52:28,453 --> 00:52:30,522
- Colonel?
- What?

655
00:52:30,624 --> 00:52:32,524
- Toby Tyler can ride.
- Who?

656
00:52:32,626 --> 00:52:34,393
- Who?
- [Jeanette] It's true.

657
00:52:34,494 --> 00:52:38,429
Toby's been riding
since he was little.
He has his own horse at home.

658
00:52:38,531 --> 00:52:41,866
You. Toby.

659
00:52:41,967 --> 00:52:46,039
Sorry, sir. I'll get right back
to the lemonade stand.

660
00:52:46,139 --> 00:52:48,840
- Can you ride?
- Me?

661
00:52:48,942 --> 00:52:51,409
Well, sir, it was just
around the farm, kind of.

662
00:52:51,511 --> 00:52:54,512
Never mind. You have experience.
I'll take care of the rest.

663
00:52:54,614 --> 00:52:58,150
- But I don't think...
- That's good. Don't think.

664
00:52:58,251 --> 00:53:00,619
Jeanette, come stand
over here next to Toby.

665
00:53:02,388 --> 00:53:04,890
Let's see
what we've got here.

666
00:53:10,495 --> 00:53:14,333
Sure. Sure. They jive together
like ham and beans.

667
00:53:14,433 --> 00:53:16,367
- What do you think?
- Hold on, Colonel.

668
00:53:16,468 --> 00:53:20,004
Yes, sir, we may
have something here,
if we work it right.

669
00:53:20,104 --> 00:53:23,473
- Right, Sam?
- I think it's
a great idea, Colonel.

670
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:28,912
Now, you listen to me, Toby.
Let's get this straight.

671
00:53:29,013 --> 00:53:31,950
We're gonna make
a rosinback rider out of you.

672
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:36,153
It won't be easy, but by
the Eternal, that's exactly
what's gonna happen.

673
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:39,089
But, sir, I gotta work
for Mr. Tupper.

674
00:53:39,189 --> 00:53:43,493
- We've got
a gentleman's agreement.
- I'll take care of Tupper.

675
00:53:44,895 --> 00:53:47,064
All right,
start first thing tomorrow.

676
00:53:47,164 --> 00:53:48,999
We'll be in Waterford
in two weeks.

677
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:52,502
I want this boy riding by then.
Now, take over.

678
00:53:52,602 --> 00:53:55,672
- He's all yours.
- But, Colonel, two weeks.

679
00:53:55,772 --> 00:53:59,509
<i>Well, I gotta be going.
I'll zee you later.</i>

680
00:54:06,484 --> 00:54:10,187
- I'll see you now.
- You heard the colonel.
He's all ours.

681
00:54:11,654 --> 00:54:13,189
Sure.

682
00:54:14,459 --> 00:54:16,493
Well, it just
isn't fair, Colonel.

683
00:54:16,593 --> 00:54:20,862
Toby Tyler is the best boy
I ever had. You can't
take him away from me.

684
00:54:20,965 --> 00:54:23,332
Will you stop whimpering
and get out of here?

685
00:54:23,432 --> 00:54:26,568
- Find yourself another boy.
- I don't want another boy.

686
00:54:26,669 --> 00:54:28,737
Customers like him.
He brings in tips.

687
00:54:28,837 --> 00:54:31,207
- I mean, money.
- Listen, Tupper, if you...

688
00:54:31,308 --> 00:54:33,575
Now, Colonel,
don't you go boiling up.

689
00:54:33,675 --> 00:54:37,612
I know you're a hard man.
People say a lot
of things about you.

690
00:54:37,713 --> 00:54:40,815
But I never heard
no one say that you
weren't fair and honest.

691
00:54:40,916 --> 00:54:44,252
Now, don't you try
to bear-grease me.

692
00:54:44,353 --> 00:54:48,256
Well, it... It's just that I
feel responsible for that boy.

693
00:54:48,357 --> 00:54:50,791
He's liable to get hurt
around them horses.

694
00:54:50,893 --> 00:54:53,593
Ben'll take good care of him.
You know that.

695
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:59,167
Yeah. Well, it just don't
rest easy on my conscience.

696
00:54:59,267 --> 00:55:05,272
Just how much do you think
it would take to soothe
that conscience of yours down?

697
00:55:05,373 --> 00:55:10,044
Well, I don't like to put it
in terms of money.

698
00:55:10,145 --> 00:55:13,947
But how about
40 dollars a week?

699
00:55:14,049 --> 00:55:16,983
I think of the going rate on
your conscience lower than that.

700
00:55:17,085 --> 00:55:20,186
- Let's make it ten.
- How does 30 sound to you?

701
00:55:20,289 --> 00:55:24,723
- It sounds like 15.
- Uh, Colonel, uh...

702
00:55:24,825 --> 00:55:27,327
I want to help you.
I'll tell you what.

703
00:55:27,429 --> 00:55:30,163
No, Mr. Tupper.
I'll tell you what I'll do.

704
00:55:30,265 --> 00:55:33,934
I'll give you 20 dollars
a week finder's fee.
If you say another word...

705
00:55:34,035 --> 00:55:37,371
That's a fair proposition.
I'll just draw up
a piece of paper.

706
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:39,705
- What?
- A gentlemen's agreement.

707
00:55:39,807 --> 00:55:43,676
If you and I can't trust
one another, what kind
of world would this be?

708
00:55:43,777 --> 00:55:46,012
- Get out of here!
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

709
00:55:54,238 --> 00:55:57,273
- Ben?
- Yeah?

710
00:55:57,374 --> 00:56:01,809
- You ever tell a lie?
- Same as anyone else.

711
00:56:01,912 --> 00:56:05,114
Finally gave it up, though.
Too much trouble.

712
00:56:05,214 --> 00:56:08,017
Any lamebrain
can lie himself into something.

713
00:56:08,118 --> 00:56:11,620
Then there's all that trouble
of working yourself
back out of it.

714
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:13,688
It's not worth it.

715
00:56:14,556 --> 00:56:17,792
Ben, I told one of those lies.

716
00:56:17,894 --> 00:56:21,129
- You don't say.
- I can't ride.

717
00:56:21,230 --> 00:56:23,430
Not hardly at all.

718
00:56:23,533 --> 00:56:25,200
I know it.

719
00:56:25,301 --> 00:56:28,669
- When you figure on leavin'?
- How'd you know?

720
00:56:28,771 --> 00:56:32,473
Ought to be a pretty good
pile of coins in that pouch now.

721
00:56:32,574 --> 00:56:35,576
I surmise you can buy a ticket
home and have money left over

722
00:56:35,677 --> 00:56:37,978
to give your Uncle Daniel.

723
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:41,883
Would you look after Mr. Stubbs?
He don't know I'm going.

724
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:43,718
He won't starve.

725
00:56:43,819 --> 00:56:47,454
I'll come back someday
and buy him from Col. Castle.

726
00:56:47,555 --> 00:56:50,291
Sure. Why don't you
get some sleep?

727
00:56:57,866 --> 00:57:00,167
Ben?

728
00:57:00,268 --> 00:57:05,038
Next to Mr. Stubbs, you and Sam
are the best friends I got.

729
00:57:05,139 --> 00:57:07,275
I'll sure hate to say goodbye.

730
00:57:07,375 --> 00:57:11,144
Don't get all wrought-up.
A few weeks, you'll forget
what I look like.

731
00:57:11,246 --> 00:57:13,913
I'll never forget you, Ben.

732
00:57:20,154 --> 00:57:22,289
Go to sleep.

733
00:57:27,561 --> 00:57:31,530
<i> A dee da da dum
Dum duh dee da da dum </i>

734
00:57:31,631 --> 00:57:34,901
<i> Duh duh dee da
Da dee da dum </i>

735
00:57:35,002 --> 00:57:38,636
<i> Da da da dee da
Da dee da dee </i>

736
00:57:38,737 --> 00:57:42,475
<i> Da dee da da dee da
Da dee dum dum </i>

737
00:58:32,023 --> 00:58:33,658
Toby.

738
00:58:35,894 --> 00:58:37,561
Toby.

739
00:58:39,197 --> 00:58:41,633
Better get up.
You've got a big day
ahead of you.

740
00:58:41,733 --> 00:58:43,966
Yes, sir.

741
00:58:59,116 --> 00:59:01,951
Mr. Stubbs.
My money. Where is it?

742
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:06,622
Where's my money?
What'd you do with it?

743
00:59:06,724 --> 00:59:08,891
- Tell me!
- [screeching]

744
00:59:08,992 --> 00:59:11,961
Tell me!
Tell me, Mr. Stubbs!

745
00:59:12,063 --> 00:59:15,030
What'd you do with my money?
Tell me!

746
00:59:15,131 --> 00:59:16,866
Tell me, Mr. Stubbs, tell me!

747
00:59:16,967 --> 00:59:20,636
- What's the trouble?
- Ben, Mr. Stubbs
threw my money away.

748
00:59:20,736 --> 00:59:23,506
And I looked
all over for it.

749
00:59:23,606 --> 00:59:26,309
Why, the ornery,
thieving little chimp.

750
00:59:26,409 --> 00:59:30,080
Why'd you do it, Mr. Stubbs?

751
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:32,614
- Take it easy, Toby.
- That's what I get

752
00:59:32,715 --> 00:59:35,452
for making a friend out of him.

753
00:59:35,552 --> 00:59:38,320
Colonel Castle said
he was your responsibility.

754
00:59:38,421 --> 00:59:41,623
You took him on, didn't you?
Nobody made you do it.

755
00:59:41,724 --> 00:59:44,894
- No.
- Then don't go
blaming the chimp.

756
00:59:44,994 --> 00:59:48,762
But, Ben, all my money,
my savings, it's gone.

757
00:59:48,864 --> 00:59:51,733
You think money
is your only problem?

758
00:59:51,833 --> 00:59:56,238
Ha! That's easy.
Here. Take what I've got.

759
00:59:56,339 --> 00:59:59,975
There's enough to get you home
and some left over.

760
01:00:00,075 --> 01:00:04,044
Go on. Take it and
get out of here before
you get in any deeper.

761
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:08,915
You mean you don't
want to run away?

762
01:00:09,018 --> 01:00:12,753
You want to go on taking care
of this ungrateful little chimp?

763
01:00:17,692 --> 01:00:20,861
You want to go in the ring and
work off some of that trouble

764
01:00:20,961 --> 01:00:23,029
you've lied yourself into?

765
01:00:23,132 --> 01:00:25,333
All right.

766
01:00:25,433 --> 01:00:28,603
See you're in that ring
at 11:00 sharp this morning.

767
01:00:28,703 --> 01:00:31,972
And don't think
it's gonna be fun.

768
01:00:45,553 --> 01:00:48,621
[Ben] That's a great trick,
but let's learn to stand first.

769
01:00:48,722 --> 01:00:51,558
Get back. Back.

770
01:00:51,658 --> 01:00:54,761
No, no. You go the same
direction as the horse.

771
01:01:02,736 --> 01:01:06,439
Keep a leg on each side
and your mind in the middle.

772
01:01:08,708 --> 01:01:11,243
Keep your body limber.
That's right.

773
01:01:11,344 --> 01:01:14,012
Steady.
Steady.

774
01:01:14,113 --> 01:01:18,249
Hup, up, up.
Carry your weight low.

775
01:01:18,352 --> 01:01:20,819
Now, feel his motion
through your feet.

776
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:23,755
Go with it.
Don't fight it.

777
01:01:23,857 --> 01:01:25,757
Whoa!

778
01:01:33,933 --> 01:01:36,068
On your knees now.

779
01:01:44,510 --> 01:01:46,645
Stand up. Stand up!

780
01:01:52,518 --> 01:01:54,485
Whoa.

781
01:01:56,721 --> 01:01:59,691
- [screaming]
- [Ben] Wait for the horse.

782
01:01:59,791 --> 01:02:02,159
Hang on.

783
01:02:02,261 --> 01:02:05,530
No, you're supposed to ride him,
not kiss him.

784
01:02:13,938 --> 01:02:16,973
No, no, no.
Let go of his ears.

785
01:02:17,075 --> 01:02:18,907
Whoa.

786
01:02:30,187 --> 01:02:32,723
Stand up.

787
01:02:34,825 --> 01:02:38,228
- Hang on.
- It's no use. I can't do it.

788
01:02:38,328 --> 01:02:42,565
- That's just what Ajax said.
- He did, did he?

789
01:02:42,666 --> 01:02:45,935
He said you'd put your tail
between your legs and quit.

790
01:02:46,035 --> 01:02:48,739
- Oh, yeah? I'll show him.
- Now let go of the rope.

791
01:02:48,838 --> 01:02:50,673
Let go.

792
01:02:50,775 --> 01:02:55,379
That's better.
It's not good, but it's better.

793
01:02:55,479 --> 01:02:57,446
Get off that horse now.
Get off.

794
01:03:01,285 --> 01:03:04,720
- Now get ready
for the fork jump.
- Now?

795
01:03:04,821 --> 01:03:08,123
Yeah, now. And this time,
watch your timing.

796
01:03:08,223 --> 01:03:10,558
Get ready. Set.

797
01:03:10,660 --> 01:03:12,828
Go.

798
01:03:16,933 --> 01:03:19,167
[grunting]

799
01:03:21,804 --> 01:03:24,805
I missed.

800
01:03:24,907 --> 01:03:26,874
It's not bad for a beginning.

801
01:03:26,976 --> 01:03:29,744
We'll work on
the stand-ups after lunch.

802
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:32,914
Olie Madden.

803
01:03:33,016 --> 01:03:35,550
Madame Tenzinne.
Two for you.

804
01:03:35,650 --> 01:03:38,586
Greta Nielson.
Toby Tyler.

805
01:03:41,457 --> 01:03:46,027
- Harris Tilford.
- Toby's busy now.
I'll take that for him.

806
01:03:46,128 --> 01:03:49,831
Frank Vernon.
Harry Birch.

807
01:03:50,765 --> 01:03:52,667
Rufus Rakin.

808
01:04:13,388 --> 01:04:14,987
"Dear Toby,

809
01:04:15,089 --> 01:04:18,391
We've had a very bad time.

810
01:04:18,492 --> 01:04:22,162
I'm afraid your Uncle Daniel
is not well.

811
01:04:22,263 --> 01:04:26,932
Without your help,
the work around the farm
is just too much for him.

812
01:04:27,033 --> 01:04:30,635
- We need you, Toby..."
- [Toby] Mr. Tupper!

813
01:04:32,606 --> 01:04:36,275
- You dropped something.
- Yes. Thank you. Thank you.

814
01:04:36,377 --> 01:04:41,146
Well, uh, how's
our star performer getting on?

815
01:04:41,248 --> 01:04:44,450
Awful, but Ben says
to come back after lunch.

816
01:04:44,551 --> 01:04:47,586
My boy, I have
complete faith in you.

817
01:04:47,687 --> 01:04:51,490
And just to prove
Harry Tupper is not just
sounding off his bazoo,

818
01:04:51,591 --> 01:04:54,726
look what I have for you.

819
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,936
The best secondhand
riding shoes money can buy.

820
01:05:08,474 --> 01:05:11,809
Now, I ask you, is Mr. Tupper
your friend, or is he?

821
01:05:11,911 --> 01:05:15,112
- Well...
- There's no need
to thank me, boy.

822
01:05:15,213 --> 01:05:20,151
You forget your chores here.
Run along and meet
your friend, Mr. Stubbs.

823
01:05:22,654 --> 01:05:24,221
- Mr. Tupper?
- Mmm?

824
01:05:24,322 --> 01:05:26,657
I don't know how to say this,

825
01:05:26,758 --> 01:05:30,327
but I want to take back some of
the things I thought about you.

826
01:05:31,996 --> 01:05:36,567
Yes. Well, there's no need
to mention it.

827
01:05:36,668 --> 01:05:39,436
I'll admit I'm not the most
patient man in the world.

828
01:05:39,538 --> 01:05:42,839
But it's how we behave
when the chips are down
that really counts.

829
01:05:42,941 --> 01:05:45,075
Am I right?

830
01:05:54,785 --> 01:05:57,386
[humming]

831
01:05:59,657 --> 01:06:02,258
[Toby] Ben?

832
01:06:02,359 --> 01:06:06,563
Think I could tell
my aunt and uncle I'm
gonna be a bareback rider?

833
01:06:06,665 --> 01:06:08,798
I don't see why not.

834
01:06:09,934 --> 01:06:12,802
Think I'll ever
ride real good?

835
01:06:12,903 --> 01:06:15,404
Well, you ain't
no Pawnee Bill,

836
01:06:15,506 --> 01:06:18,140
but by the time we open,
you will look professional,

837
01:06:18,241 --> 01:06:20,844
or my name
ain't Benjamin Obadiah Cotter.

838
01:06:36,125 --> 01:06:39,528
Ben? How do you spell "uncle"?

839
01:06:39,629 --> 01:06:44,232
Uncle?
Well, now... that depends.

840
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:47,903
In some parts you spell it
one way, other parts
spell it the other.

841
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:49,470
What part are we in?

842
01:06:49,571 --> 01:06:52,340
It's not the spellin'
of a letter that's important.

843
01:06:52,441 --> 01:06:54,174
It's what you say in it.

844
01:06:54,275 --> 01:06:57,645
Now, did you tell the folks
you missed them?

845
01:06:57,746 --> 01:07:01,817
- Not exactly.
- Well, then, did you
say you love them?

846
01:07:01,918 --> 01:07:05,086
Folks put an awful lot of store
in things like that.

847
01:07:09,290 --> 01:07:12,393
I love you very much.

848
01:07:12,495 --> 01:07:15,062
Cordially...

849
01:07:18,265 --> 01:07:21,602
Ben, how do you spell
"cordially"?

850
01:07:23,137 --> 01:07:27,474
Why don't you just sign it
"Your friend, Toby Tyler,"
and stop bothering me.

851
01:07:30,111 --> 01:07:32,513
[audience applauding]

852
01:07:56,737 --> 01:08:01,107
You'd be scared too,
if you had to go out
in front of all those people.

853
01:08:02,542 --> 01:08:04,209
Well, how are we
getting along?

854
01:08:04,311 --> 01:08:06,545
It doesn't seem
to fit too well.

855
01:08:06,647 --> 01:08:10,449
[with accent] Let's see.
Let's see can we do something
about that there.

856
01:08:10,550 --> 01:08:14,252
Stay right there
for a minute. Let's see.

857
01:08:14,353 --> 01:08:17,322
If we take up the slack
in the back here,

858
01:08:17,423 --> 01:08:21,460
I think maybe that the front...
The front would be, uh...

859
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:24,495
The front is...
Turn around this way once,

860
01:08:24,598 --> 01:08:26,163
because across here...

861
01:08:26,265 --> 01:08:27,832
Ooh, ooh,

862
01:08:27,934 --> 01:08:33,537
<i>If we did a sleeve,
und this doesn't look too...</i>

863
01:08:33,639 --> 01:08:36,008
- It's awful, isn't it?
- I think so.

864
01:08:36,108 --> 01:08:38,376
I don't think
even magic could help it.

865
01:08:38,477 --> 01:08:40,377
There's all kinds
of magic, you know.

866
01:08:40,479 --> 01:08:43,214
The magic where you got the hat
and you take the rabbit...

867
01:08:43,315 --> 01:08:46,751
But this is no good for...
Oh, ho, ho.

868
01:08:46,853 --> 01:08:49,821
I got the magic.
I got the right kind of magic.

869
01:08:49,922 --> 01:08:51,522
Close the eyes.

870
01:08:51,624 --> 01:08:54,592
<i>Und keep them closed tight.</i>

871
01:08:57,596 --> 01:08:59,496
Now, then,
how does it go again?

872
01:08:59,598 --> 01:09:03,067
Oh, yes. "Needles and pins,
needles and pins.

873
01:09:03,168 --> 01:09:06,737
When you presto the change-o,
the magic commences."

874
01:09:09,708 --> 01:09:11,943
Open the eyes.

875
01:09:13,811 --> 01:09:16,713
- Surprise.
- [all] Good luck, Toby.

876
01:09:16,814 --> 01:09:22,052
Monsieur Toby, in a few moments
you will make your debut
as a featured performer

877
01:09:22,153 --> 01:09:23,887
in Colonel Castle's
Great American Circus.

878
01:09:23,989 --> 01:09:28,091
- But I...
- Shh. And we,
your fellow performers,

879
01:09:28,192 --> 01:09:31,761
not wishing to see
the luster of this occasion
dimmed in any way,

880
01:09:31,863 --> 01:09:35,265
- from a sartorial
point of view...
- What?

881
01:09:35,366 --> 01:09:38,769
Or as Papa Schultz might say,
"When you go in front
of the people,

882
01:09:38,869 --> 01:09:44,473
you should never wear
this ridiculous, awful...
the baggy pants...

883
01:09:44,574 --> 01:09:47,610
- You shouldn't do it."
- [all chuckling]

884
01:09:47,711 --> 01:09:49,978
- Good luck, Toby.
- Thanks.

885
01:09:53,817 --> 01:09:57,385
Here's the rest of it, Toby.

886
01:09:59,989 --> 01:10:03,893
You have just about
three minutes to get dressed,
Monsieur Toby.

887

<i>[ band plays The Blue Danube]</i>

888
01:10:37,459 --> 01:10:41,595
Mr. Stubbs,
have you seen my shoes?

889
01:10:41,696 --> 01:10:45,533
Good night. I left them over
at the lemonade stand.

890
01:10:46,701 --> 01:10:49,503
- Where's Toby?
- Still dressing, I guess.

891
01:11:09,256 --> 01:11:12,860
Mr. Stubbs,
how'd you get loose?

892
01:11:27,274 --> 01:11:29,175
Toby?

893
01:11:33,613 --> 01:11:35,948
No, Mr. Stubbs!

894
01:11:46,093 --> 01:11:48,459
"Master Toby Tyler"?

895
01:11:51,298 --> 01:11:54,032
They're all for me.
They're from Aunt Olive.

896
01:11:54,134 --> 01:11:56,501
Mr. Stubbs,
they did write!

897
01:11:56,602 --> 01:11:58,303
What the devil
are you doing here?

898
01:11:58,404 --> 01:12:02,073
- Look, Ben, they did write.
- You haven't got time now.
Hurry.

899
01:12:02,176 --> 01:12:04,574
I'll take care of the chimp.

900
01:12:19,025 --> 01:12:21,926
[drumroll]

901
01:12:22,027 --> 01:12:24,594
Now, ladies and gentlemen,

902
01:12:24,696 --> 01:12:27,631
we present
for your kind approval

903
01:12:27,732 --> 01:12:31,068

904

Mademoiselle Jeanette
and Monsieur Toby.

905
01:12:34,974 --> 01:12:38,443
- Jeanette and Toby.

Lemonade. Here we are.
It's pink, cold, refreshing.

It's ice-cold... lemonade...
It's made...

- Toby, you rode like a champ.
- You were just great.

914
01:15:35,814 --> 01:15:38,716
Excuse me.
I got to read my letters.

<i>and, with the rest of the work,
it's too much for him.</i>

921
01:16:07,611 --> 01:16:12,517
They want me to come home,
Mr. Stubbs. They need me.

922
01:16:14,252 --> 01:16:17,421
I've got to go
before they try and stop me.

923

[fanfare]

924
01:16:58,361 --> 01:17:02,064
I can't take you with me,
you know, Mr. Stubbs.

925
01:17:02,165 --> 01:17:06,302
You don't belong to me.
They'd say I stole you.

926
01:17:06,403 --> 01:17:08,736
- You understand, don't you?
- Mm-hmm.

927
01:17:08,837 --> 01:17:11,406
I'll come back
and get you someday.

928
01:17:11,507 --> 01:17:13,809
Honest I will.

929
01:18:17,171 --> 01:18:18,771
Toby?

930
01:18:18,872 --> 01:18:20,541
Toby!

931
01:18:27,781 --> 01:18:29,782
"Dear Ben and Sam,

932
01:18:29,884 --> 01:18:33,319
I'm sorry to tell you this,
but I am leaving the circus..."

933
01:18:35,923 --> 01:18:38,290
That ungrateful little whelp.

934
01:18:38,391 --> 01:18:40,593
After all I've done for him.

935
01:18:57,710 --> 01:19:00,212
Good morning, gentlemen.
You got a phone?

936
01:19:07,820 --> 01:19:11,455
Operator, get me the sheriff
over to Bartonsville.

937
01:19:11,558 --> 01:19:13,658
Yeah, it's important.

938
01:19:14,893 --> 01:19:16,928
Sheriff?
This is Harry Tupper,

939
01:19:17,028 --> 01:19:19,363
representing Castle's
Great American Circus.

940
01:19:19,464 --> 01:19:24,336
Yeah. I want you to keep
your eye open for a small boy,
about 11 years old.

941
01:19:24,437 --> 01:19:29,106
Calls himself Toby Tyler.
I figure he's going
in your direction.

942
01:19:30,242 --> 01:19:32,075
He ran away from the circus.

943
01:19:32,176 --> 01:19:37,080
Took along a valuable animal
belonging to Colonel Castle,
a chimpanzee.

944
01:19:37,182 --> 01:19:39,283
Thanks, Sheriff.
Say, Sheriff,

945
01:19:39,384 --> 01:19:42,519
you find the boy, we'll be glad
to express our appreciation.

946
01:19:42,621 --> 01:19:44,987
Know what I mean?
All right.

947
01:19:46,558 --> 01:19:49,960
Say, I don't suppose either
of you have glimpsed the lad.

948
01:19:50,061 --> 01:19:51,026
No.

949
01:19:51,128 --> 01:19:53,430
- Oh, a hunter, eh?
- Mm-hmm.

950
01:19:53,530 --> 01:19:56,833
I suppose you know these parts
around here pretty well.

951
01:19:56,934 --> 01:19:58,802
- Some.
- Tell you what.

952
01:19:58,903 --> 01:20:03,806
You find that boy,
and there's a reward of, say,
ten dollars in it for you.

953
01:20:03,907 --> 01:20:06,843
Sorry, I'm not much
on tracking small boys.

954
01:20:06,943 --> 01:20:09,912
Bobcat's about
fearsome enough for me.

955
01:20:11,148 --> 01:20:13,949
Yeah. Suit yourself.

I'm sorry.
Believe me, I'm sorry.

996
01:25:31,758 --> 01:25:34,359
Get away from us.

997
01:25:34,461 --> 01:25:37,496
[crying]

998
01:25:37,598 --> 01:25:39,599
What's this?
What? Huh?

999
01:25:39,699 --> 01:25:44,403
Oh, Mr. Stubbs.
Don't leave me, Mr. Stubbs.

1000
01:25:50,077 --> 01:25:54,146
Well, now, Toby, that's too bad.
That's really too bad.

1001
01:25:55,715 --> 01:25:57,148
You see, Toby.

1002
01:25:57,249 --> 01:26:00,685
If you hadn't run away,
this wouldn't have happened.

1003
01:26:00,785 --> 01:26:02,154
It's your fault.

1004
01:26:02,254 --> 01:26:06,257
- My fault?
- Surely you see that.

1005
01:26:06,358 --> 01:26:10,495
Mr. Stubbs would be alive
and well if you hadn't run off.

1006
01:26:10,596 --> 01:26:15,100
- Come on. Let's go back.
- I want Mr. Stubbs.

1007
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:16,935
Now, look!

1008
01:26:18,870 --> 01:26:21,840
Now, look, Toby.
Mr. Stubbs is dead.

1009
01:26:21,941 --> 01:26:25,676
And there's nothing you can do
to change that. So, come on.

1010
01:26:25,778 --> 01:26:28,311
Maybe the colonel
will give you another pet.

1011
01:26:28,412 --> 01:26:31,649
- No! I won't leave him.
- Come on.

1012
01:26:31,750 --> 01:26:34,251
It wasn't the boy's fault.
It was mine.

1013
01:26:34,352 --> 01:26:36,452
It's all right.
Accidents will happen.

1014
01:26:36,555 --> 01:26:39,456
The important thing is
we found the lad safe and sound.

1015
01:26:57,475 --> 01:26:59,475
Hey! Hey, wait a minute!

1016
01:27:12,389 --> 01:27:13,923
Wait!

1017
01:27:14,023 --> 01:27:16,826
Wait a minute.
I'll tell him! Stop!

1018
01:27:28,571 --> 01:27:32,908
Colonel Castle, I ran away,
and Mr. Stubbs followed me.

1019
01:27:33,009 --> 01:27:35,510
I didn't want it to happen.
Honest I didn't.

1020
01:27:35,611 --> 01:27:39,014
Toby... Toby, there is
someone here to see you.

1021
01:27:44,821 --> 01:27:47,288
[Olive] Toby.

1022
01:27:49,391 --> 01:27:52,194
Toby, will you
forgive me?

1023
01:28:08,576 --> 01:28:10,510
You lily-livered skunk.

1024
01:28:10,612 --> 01:28:12,880
I found out what you did
with Toby's letters.

1025
01:28:12,982 --> 01:28:15,850
Now, Ben, I...
I didn't want to upset the lad.

1026
01:28:15,951 --> 01:28:19,352
Tampering with the mails.
That calls for a jail sentence.

1027
01:28:19,453 --> 01:28:20,921
Just a little tamper.

1028
01:28:21,022 --> 01:28:25,259
I'm gonna make you one of
those gentlemen's agreements
you're fond of.

1029
01:28:25,359 --> 01:28:28,262
Fine, fine. I'd like that
just fine. Anything you say.

1030
01:28:28,363 --> 01:28:33,332
I want you to give up
that share of Toby's money
you've been getting.

1031
01:28:33,433 --> 01:28:37,603
Ben, let's talk this over.
You don't know
what you're saying.

1032
01:28:38,673 --> 01:28:41,108
I want you to stay away
from that boy.

1033
01:28:41,209 --> 01:28:43,077
Yes. Absolutely, yes.

1034
01:28:43,178 --> 01:28:45,780
And I want you to behave
real nice and pretty.

1035
01:28:45,880 --> 01:28:47,513
Depend on it. Oh, yes, sir.

1036
01:28:47,614 --> 01:28:51,484
Because if you don't,
I'm liable to do
something like this.

1037
01:28:51,584 --> 01:28:55,222
Yes, Ben, yes.
No, Ben, no!

1038
01:29:12,273 --> 01:29:14,740
- Happy to see you back, Toby.
- Thank you.

1039
01:29:14,842 --> 01:29:18,278
Hi. Looks like a full house
tonight. Do your best now.

1040
01:29:18,377 --> 01:29:19,978
- I'll sure try.
- Good.

1041
01:29:20,079 --> 01:29:22,747
You've made a lot
of good friends, Toby.

1042
01:29:22,850 --> 01:29:25,550
I just wish you
could've met Mr. Stubbs.

1043
01:29:25,651 --> 01:29:28,686
Colonel Castle
told us about him.

1044
01:29:28,788 --> 01:29:30,754
This was his wagon.

1045
01:29:30,858 --> 01:29:33,859
He was my best friend.

1046
01:29:36,061 --> 01:29:38,997
Well, I see you're showing
the folks around, eh, Toby?

1047
01:29:39,098 --> 01:29:41,299
- Uh-huh.
- Would you do me a big favor

1048
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:44,902
and go and tell Sam Treat to
meet me behind the stock tent?

1049
01:29:45,004 --> 01:29:46,704
Sure.

1050
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:49,773
Come on.

1051
01:29:50,175 --> 01:29:52,810
Sam!

1052
01:29:54,379 --> 01:29:57,781
What are you doing here?

1053
01:30:12,363 --> 01:30:14,797
Mr. Stubbs!

1054
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:18,902
Oh, Mr. Stubbs.
Is he all right?

1055
01:30:19,004 --> 01:30:21,538
Bullet only ventilated
his hide a little.

1056
01:30:26,377 --> 01:30:28,778
Mr. Stubbs.

1057
01:30:32,316 --> 01:30:35,285
Mr. Stubbs. Mr. Stubbs.

1058
01:30:35,385 --> 01:30:37,720
[whistle blowing]

1059
01:30:47,562 --> 01:30:52,201
Popcorn,
candied... apples...

1060
01:31:08,751 --> 01:31:11,619
- Peanuts?
- Yes, sir.

1061
01:31:13,022 --> 01:31:16,792
Peanuts, popcorn,
candied apples.

1062
01:32:17,818 --> 01:32:21,787
And now, may I direct
your attention

1063
01:32:21,889 --> 01:32:25,391
to a feat of horsemanship
and balance

1064
01:32:25,492 --> 01:32:28,761
seldom witnessed
in the sawdust ring.

1065
01:32:28,862 --> 01:32:31,298
Ladies and gentlemen,

1066
01:32:31,398 --> 01:32:35,001
- Monsieur Toby.
- [applause]

1067
01:32:35,102 --> 01:32:38,304
[band plays fanfare]

1068
01:33:01,460 --> 01:33:04,729
[applause]

1069
01:33:34,292 --> 01:33:35,960
[Toby] Whoa!

1070
01:33:36,062 --> 01:33:39,163
[audience laughing]

1071
01:33:41,899 --> 01:33:45,669
[laughing continues]

1072
01:33:45,769 --> 01:33:49,373
[cheering, applause]

1073
01:33:52,042 --> 01:33:56,513
Ice-cold lemonade here.
It's pink, it's cold,
it's refreshing.

1074
01:34:01,686 --> 01:34:04,521
[audience laughing]

1075
01:34:07,757 --> 01:34:09,925
That little boy.
Isn't he wonderful?

1076
01:34:10,026 --> 01:34:12,795
[both] He's our boy.

1077
01:34:21,205 --> 01:34:24,640
[cheering, applause]

1078
01:34:28,811 --> 01:34:32,148
- Ben.
- Colonel, I'm sorry about this.

1079
01:34:32,248 --> 01:34:36,652
This is the greatest yet.
Why didn't you tell me?

1080
01:34:36,753 --> 01:34:39,255
- I didn't know.
- Congratulations, Ben.

1081
01:34:39,356 --> 01:34:44,193
Congratulations.
We'll bill him
as "Monsieur Stubbs."

1082
01:34:51,234 --> 01:34:53,268
[applause]

1083
01:35:04,280 --> 01:35:09,350
- [fanfare]
- [cheering]

1084
01:35:12,086 --> 01:35:15,022
Peanuts, popcorn, lemonade.

1085
01:35:15,123 --> 01:35:18,459
It's pink,
it's refreshing...

1086
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:20,328
It's cold.
