(MEN SINGING)

2
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,960
Out of the night
When the full moon is bright

3
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:34,480
Comes a horseman known as Zorro

4
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:39,880
This bold renegade
carves a "Z" with his blade

5
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,120
A "Z" that stands for Zorro

6
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,440
Zorro

7
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,680
Zorro

8
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,720
The fox so cunning and free

9
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,000
Zorro

10
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,280
Zorro

11
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,200
Who makes the sign of the "Z"

12
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,440
Zorro

13
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,640
Zorro

14

Zorro

17
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,040
Who makes the sign of the "Z"

18
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,720
-Zorro...
-Zorro...

(BOTH GRUNTING)

20
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,800
Well done, SeÃ±or de la Vega.

21
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,560
(BOTH PANTING)

22
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,640
I shall miss these daily bouts.

23
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,520
I too, sir. They have made
the long voyage most enjoyable.

24
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,640
Your agility with a sword, sir,
should serve you well in California.

25
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,880
Why do you say that?

26
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,320
How long have you been away?

27
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,560
Three years.

28
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,760
(EXHALES) I am afraid
you're going to find conditions

29
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,960
quite changed when you reach Los Angeles.

30
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,600
Haven't you finished packing yet?
We'll be going ashore soon.

31
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,560
Yes, California is beautiful.

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,360
Where did you put my father's letters?

33
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,960
I want to read the last one again.

34
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,520
"My dear son,
it is with a heavy heart

35
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,960
"that I ask you to give up
your studies and come home.

36
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,400
"Certain matters have arisen
which I can no longer face alone."

37
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,000
You know how puzzled
I have been over this?

38
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,600
Well, now I know
what he was trying to tell us.

39
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,520
We're heading for trouble, Bernardo.

40
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,560
No, no, not Indians. PolÃ­ticos.

41
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,680
I have just learned that our pueblo
is under the heel of a dictator.

42
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,320
We're certain to be searched on arrival.
Burn this.

43
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,280
No one must suspect that my
father has summoned me home.

44
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,840
We must find a way
to deal with this tyrant.

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,280
Ah, the direct approach? No, Bernardo.

46
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,760
When dealing with a powerful enemy,
we must play another game.

47
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,200
You know the old proverb...

48
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,320
"When you cannot clothe yourself
in the skin of a lion,

49
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,600
"put on that of the fox."

50
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,640
I must convince the new comandante
that I am perfectly harmless.

51
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,720
But how?

52
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,960
Ah! An excellent idea!

53
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,480
Instead of a man of action,
I shall become a man of letters,

54
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,320
an innocent scholar interested
only in arts and sciences.

55
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,720

57
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,640
Well, as for these
fencing medals and trophies...

58
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,520
They are no longer part of my life.
Throw them overboard.

59
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,800
Oh.

60
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,880
No, Bernardo. Get rid of them.

61
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,040
Here. This, too. Go.

62
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,400
Bernardo, this is no time for sentiment.
Throw them out.

63
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,480
(WATER SPLASHING)

64
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,000
Now, get me my fanciest jacket,

65
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,320
the one with the gold braid,
and my walking stick.

66
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,240
It shall be part of my new character.

67
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,600
You also...

68
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,680
You also want to be something you are not.

69
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,840
Very well, you shall play the fool.

70
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,520
(LAUGHING)

71
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,600
You want to pretend you cannot hear?
Even better!

72
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,720
You shall be the eyes and ears
behind my back.

73
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,360
From now on, you not only cannot speak,
you hear nothing.

74
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,520
Bravo, Bernardo.

75
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,320
Cochero, why are we stopping here?

76
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,400
All vehicles passing through Los Angeles
must be inspected, patron.

77
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,560
But this is an imposition.

78
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,120
We have already gone through customs!

79
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,600
All baggage to be opened!

80
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,040
Passengers have
their identity papers ready.

81
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,440
Don Diego de la Vega.

82
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,360
I thought you were still in Spain.

83
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,000
Obviously, I have returned, Sergeant.

84
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,200
Uh, what is this nonsense
about another inspection?

85
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,400
For you, Don Diego, a mere formality.

86
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,480
Oh, then my luggage does not
have to be opened again?

87
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,640
Forgive me, please,
but CapitÃ¡n Monastario,

88
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,200
he allows no exceptions.

89
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,920
Is he the new comandante?

90
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,000
Ah, for over a year now.

91
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,840
Please, SeÃ±or, he makes the orders.
I only carry them out.

92
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,800
Very well, then, Sergeant.
Get on with it.

93
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,120
SÃ­.

94
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,840
(STAMMERS)

95
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,440
What is this?

96
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,520
Oh, I am instructing my mozo
to remove the luggage.

97
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,960
-He is deaf and dumb?
-Since childhood.

98
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,400
Would you mind helping my manservant
with the luggage, please?

99
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,600
SÃ­, Don Diego. SÃ­.

100
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,880
I don't like it.

101
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,960
Why has the son returned so unexpectedly?

102
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,960
What difference does it make, Licenciado?

103
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,720
The de la Vegas
are the most important family

104
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,040
in Southern California.

105
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,160
Do you think Don Alejandro
called him back?

106
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,440
Even if he did, there is
nothing to worry about.

107
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,640
If he is a troublemaker,

108
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,920
I shall handle him
as I did all the others.

109
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,520
Nothing shall stop me
from being the richest man

110
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,520
in all of California.

111
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,240
Out of the way! Clear the street!

112
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,160
Sergeant Garcia, that is
my neighbor, Nacho Torres.

113
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,600
Why is he being brought in?

114
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,120
The Comandante ordered his arrest.

115
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,920
MAN: One moment!

116
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,160
Why have you taken this man prisoner?

117
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,400
Help me, SeÃ±or Alcalde. I am innocent.

118
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,720
What are the charges
against you, Don Nacho?

119
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,840
They accuse me of treason,
but it is a lie.

120
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,320
I dared to speak out against injustice.

121
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,640
It is forbidden to speak to this prisoner.

122
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,440
Take him inside and lock him up.

123
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,600
Are you Diego de la Vega?

124
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,160
At your service, Comandante.

125
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,320
CapitÃ¡n Enrique Sanches Monastario.

126
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,880
I'm sorry to inconvenience you.

127
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,680
Not at all, Comandante.

128
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,840
As a matter of fact,

129
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,800
it gave me the opportunity
to finish this last chapter...

130
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,480
"The effects of moorish culture
on Spanish poetry."

131
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,880
Have you read it?

132
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,960
No, I have not.

133
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,120
Oh, then I must lend it to you
when I finish.

134
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,760
Thank you. Some other time.

135
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,440
Would you please make yourself comfortable
in my quarters?

136
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,280
I shall not detain you long.

137
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,560
(CHUCKLES)

138
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,920
-Did he say why he has returned?
-I shall find out.

139
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,600
But, certainly, we have nothing to fear
from that fastidious seÃ±orito.

140
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,240
Get back to the inn.
We should not be seen together.

141
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,000
What are you doing up there?

142
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,000
You... Come down here.

143
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,240
I'll teach you to spy on me!
Come down, I say...

144
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,000
-CapitÃ¡n, your pardon.
-What are you doing? You, speak.

145
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,840
But this man, he cannot answer you.

146
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,600
-He is deaf and dumb.
-Who is he?

147
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,440
Don Diego's servant.
He brought him from Spain.

148
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,840
Get on with the inspection, Sergeant.

149
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,360
-(GUNSHOT)
-(SCREAMS)

150
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,280
Carry on, Sargento.

151
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,920
I know you are anxious
to be on your way home.

152
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,880
Yes, it's been a most fatiguing day.

153
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,760
Please fill out this brief declaration,
if you don't mind.

154
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,520
Your return is rather unexpected,
is it not?

155
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,000
Your father gave the impression

156
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,520
that you would be at
the university another year.

157
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,880
Well, I decided to forgo it.

158
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,400
There was an overemphasis
on gymnastics, swordsmanship...

159
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,760
You know, there were even duels
among some of the students.

160
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,960
-Really?
-Yes.

161
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,760
(GRUNTS) How this Toledo blade sings!

162
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,160
A thousand pardons, Don Diego.

163
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,320
Your father would never forgive me
if anything happened to you.

164
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,240
Welcome home, Don Diego.

165
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,240
Juan, it's good to see you.

166
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,040
Is this pepito?

167
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,760
How is my father?
Have you taken good care of him?

168
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,760
-We have tried, Don Diego.
-(LAUGHS)

169
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,280
Juan, this is Bernardo.

170
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,200
He cannot speak nor hear,
but he would die for me if necessary.

171
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,400
Show him where my room is.

172
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,520
SÃ­, patrÃ³n.

173
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,920
-Father.
-My son.

174
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,520
It fills my heart to see you again.

175
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,360
I send a boy to Spain,
and a man returns.

176
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,280
Diego, I have many things to tell you,

177
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,680
but they can wait until you have changed

178
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,840
and we have had supper.

179
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,640
Come. Your old room is waiting for you.

180
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,800
(PLAYING PIANO)

181
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,560
The vaqueros used to sing this
as they rode home from work.

182
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,520
You know, this piano needs tuning.

183
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,680
Are you not interested at all
in what I have been telling you?

184
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,040
Extremely so, Father.

185
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,920
I'm sorry to find
the situation so unpleasant.

186
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,480
Unpleasant? It is intolerable!

187
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,680
The rancheros are being taxed
out of existence.

188
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,040
Those who cannot pay are
flogged and thrown into prison.

189
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,160
The Indians are torn from their families
and forced into slave labor,

190
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,120
all for the benefit of one man...
CapitÃ¡n Monastario.

191
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,080
I have met the gentleman.

192
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,520
Gentleman? (SCOFFS)

193
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,640
He is a black-hearted scoundrel.

194
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,760
If he remains in power,
our country faces ruin.

195
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,440
We must get rid of him, Diego.
That's why I have called you home.

196
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,920
Someone must do something!

197
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,720
You're right, Father.

198
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,280
I am going to sit down

199
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,480
and write a detailed letter of complaint
to the Governor.

200
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,760
It would never reach him.

201
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,720
Monastario's guards intercept
all mail into Monterey.

202
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,880
Our neighbor, Nacho Torres,
dared to protest,

203
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,440
and this morning
he was arrested for treason.

204
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,800
Well, have you... Have you appealed
to the civil authorities?

205
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,920
-Certainly, we have rights under the law.
-Monastario is the law!

206
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,560
He brought in
a crooked lawyer from Mexico City

207
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,760
to make his crimes appear legal.

208
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,240
Then I fail to see what we can do.

209
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,000
We can stand up to him! Fight him!

210
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,560
Calm yourself, Father.

211
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,480
The use of force
should be our last resort.

212
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,000
I hardly expected such discretion
from a son of mine.

213
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,760
You are tired, my boy.

214
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,840
Go to your room and sleep on it.
We shall discuss it tomorrow.

215
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,800
With your permission.

216
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,920
Bernardo, I've just had to do
something I'm not very proud of.

217
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,400
I've convinced my father
that I'm a spineless weakling.

218
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,200
But if I were to take open action,
as he wants to do,

219
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,960
his life would be in danger.

220
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,000
Now I'm free to act alone.

221
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,080
You remember what I said this morning?

222
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,640
"If you cannot clothe yourself
in the skin of a lion,

223
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,400
"put on that of the fox."

224
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,120
Well, from now on,
I shall be Zorro the Fox.

225
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,680
I brought you out here
to meet a third member.

226
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,880
An ally. (WHISTLES)

227
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,560
(NEIGHING)

228
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,600
(WHISTLES)

229
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,240
His name is Tornado.

230
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,880
An old shepherd
has been keeping him for me.

231
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,440
He was a colt when I left.

232
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,120
(TORNADO NEIGHING)

233
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,120
Tornado.

234
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,640
Carrot.

235
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,920
Here, I have a carrot for you.

236
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,480
Here, boy. There.

237
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,960
All right, it's been
such a long time, huh?

238
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,760
Hey, have you forgotten
the tricks I taught you?

239
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,000
Oh, you think you can kneel?

240
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,880
Come on. Let's see if you can kneel.

241
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,040
Kneel, Tornado, kneel.

242
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,480
Kneel. Kneel. (LAUGHS)

243
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,280
Good boy.

244
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,480
That's a horse, eh?

245
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,000
Well, Bernardo,
our second mission is accomplished.

246
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,480
Even my father wouldn't
recognize this horse.

247
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,840
Tornado, you and I are
going for a long ride tonight.

248
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,000
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

249
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,280
You went to town today.

250
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,360
Someone was hanged?

251
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,320
Someone is going to be hanged.

252
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,840
Nacho Torres.

253
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,240
In all California, Bernardo,

254
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,880
there is no greater patriot
than Nacho Torres.

255
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,320
Such a man hanged for treason
by a ruthless comandante...

256
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,400
No, Bernardo, it cannot be.

257
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,720
This shall be the disguise
of El Zorro the Fox.

258
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,160
I will not go out that way.

259
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,920
These old haciendas
have many secrets, Bernardo.

260
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,160
I will show you one I discovered
by accident many years ago.

261
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,360
Come.

262
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,440
Light the other lantern, Bernardo.

263
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,560
This will be our fortress,
guarding all of our secrets.

264
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,440
Over there, you will find a staircase

265
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,080
leading down to a secret cave
where I've hidden Tornado.

266
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,480
It will be his home.

267
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,000
We are now ready for the first assignment
of El Zorro, to rescue Nacho Torres.

268
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,160
After that, we'll see what we can do

269
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,120
about ridding Los Angeles
of the treacherous CapitÃ¡n Monastario.

270
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,680
You can wait in my room.

271
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,000
AdiÃ³s.

272
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,600
(CHUCKLES)

273
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,960
(NEIGHING)

274
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:41,720
10:00 on a warm, silent night!

275
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,880
All is well!

276
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,680
Sergeant Garcia!

277
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,080
At your orders, mi CapitÃ¡n.

278
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,240
Bar the gate, dismiss the guard.

279
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,800
Leave one patrol saddled.

280
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,880
After final inspection, report to me.

281
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,280
Very good, SeÃ±or Comandante.

282
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,320
Bar the gate!

283
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,000
How long must we wait?

284
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,960
Half an hour or so.
By then everyone would be asleep.

285
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,200
Suppose something goes wrong?

286
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,160
Oh, you are more of an old woman
than you are a lawyer.

287
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,560
What can go wrong? And stop pacing about.

288
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,840
You will make me nervous.

289
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,680
Better still, wait in my quarters

290
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,520
until the Sergeant reports,
and don't worry!

291
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,120
All present and accounted for, mi CapitÃ¡n.

292
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,440
Is the prisoner, Torres, secure?

293
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,680
He is a dangerous man,
Sergeant, full of much cunning.

294
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,000
I myself have just examined his cell.

295
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,640
Excelente!

296
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,040
I will mention you in this report, Garcia.

297
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,560
Gracias, SeÃ±or Comandante.

298
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,560
You may go to bed now, Sergeant,

299
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,080
and leave your keys on the desk.

300
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,920
Gracias, CapitÃ¡n!

301
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,600
SeÃ±or Torres.

302
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,160
Who are you?

303
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,000
A friend. I've come to help you.

304
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,400
God love you, friend.

305
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,840
But how can you help me?

306
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,160
I am chained like an animal.

307
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,280
Who has the keys?

308
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,600
Sergeant Garcia.

309
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,280
Then I will relieve him of them.

310
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,080
Now, in a little while, you will take
the keys and release the prisoner.

311
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,440
But won't he suspect something?

312
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,800
Oh, you are a lawyer.

313
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,440
You will tell him
you have reviewed his case

314
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,760
and there has been a mistake.

315
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,560
When he crosses the courtyard,
you will give the alarm.

316
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,440
I will be waiting right here.

317
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,280
It is already in my report.

318
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,200
"Fugitive shot while
attempting to escape."

319
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,200
(VOCALIZING)

320
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,160
(GRUNTS AND CONTINUES VOCALIZING)

321
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,200
The slightest sound will be your last.

322
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,320
What do you want from me?

323
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,600
-The keys...
-The keys?

324
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,600
...to the cell door
and the prisoner's chains.

325
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,000
The Comandante has the keys.

326
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,120
I just gave them to him.

327
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,240
Get up.

328
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,800
Go to that corner.

329
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,920
GARCIA: You're not going
to kill me, are you?

330
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,200
Not unless you move.
I'll be standing right behind you.

331
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,240
I have good news for you, SeÃ±or Torres.

332
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,920
I have come to set you free.

333
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,920
Why are you releasing me now?

334
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,240
You are the lawyer who
signed the accusation papers.

335
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,280
I have just discovered
that the charges against you were false.

336
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,320
Thank you, Licenciado.

337
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,080
You have most kindly solved
the problem for us.

338
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,240
I advise you to make no outcry.

339
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,280
SeÃ±or Torres, I do not trust this lawyer.
Chain him to the bars.

340
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,280
Now, I suggest we take our leave over
the wall. There's a horse by the tree.

341
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,240
SeÃ±or, who are you?

342
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,600
A friend of the people. El Zorro.

343
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,520
Escape while you can!

344
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,440
Sergeant Garcia!

345
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,720
Garcia!

346
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,680
Yeah!

347
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,280
Sergeant Garcia!

348
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,880
-(GRUNTS)
-(LAUGHS)

349
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,440
Beautiful coupÃ© to the wall.

350
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,800
You must show me that again, Comandante.

351
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,680
Now, will you please get inside the cell?

352
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,440

I must prepare myself for
some legal advice, no doubt.

For what it's worth,
I advise you to listen.

We tell the people we are on their side
against the landowners.

I'm worried about is Zorro.

the sooner Zorro must ride to save them.

to SeÃ±ora and SeÃ±orita Torres.

who have been our friends and neighbors.

What do we propose to do about?

430
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,920
What would Don Alejandro suggest?

431
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,760
I suggest the only decent
and honorable thing we can do.

432
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,880
Let us go forth and demand the release
of those two gentlewomen here and now.

433
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,240
Let us back the demand
with force if necessary!

435
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,360
You speak of force.

436
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,000
But what force do you have against
the bulwark of the cuartel

437
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,080
and the soldiers manning it?

438
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,160
When the gauntlet is flung into your face,

439
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,000
you do not stop to appraise your weapons.

440
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,000

00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,880
I agree with Don Alejandro.
The time has come for action.

444
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,080
The time for talk is past.

445
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,640
But I also agree with Don Diego.

446
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,200
Of what use is it to go and chop at the
gates of the cuartel with our swords,

447
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,880
to march like lambs to the slaughter?

448
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,000
Let us formulate a plan.

449
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,680
Let us use wisdom as well as courage.

450
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:28,240
It is not so easy to get
within the gates of the cuartel,

451
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,720
now that the Comandante has closed them.

452
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,200
Nor is it so difficult.

453
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,000

once more for Don Alejandro.

456
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,960
I was standing at the window
and I heard them plot it all, mi CapitÃ¡n.

457
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,080
I heard every word of it.

458
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,400
Stupid fool! Why did you not remain there

459
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,720
to be sure you had the names
of all who attended?

460
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,800
There were two you did not recognize?

461
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,800
I dared not expose myself.

462
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,840
Uh, very well, it is no consequence.

463
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,560
I will have a trap all set
for them when they arrive.

00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,640
Yes, CapitÃ¡n.

466
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,240
Sound the alarm. Prepare for a surprise
attack on the cuartel.

467
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:12,480
CapitÃ¡n, would it be out of order
to ask who is going to attack us?

468
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,400
What difference does it make?
Do as you are told!

469
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,600
SÃ­, Comandante.

470
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,920
Father, I implore you,
please, do not do such a foolish thing.

471
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,800
I cannot stand here and debate with you.

472
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,400
They are depending upon me
to open the gates of the cuartel.

473
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,160
Do you ride with me or do I ride alone?

474
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,840
But won't you listen to reason?

475
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:36,160
You're not only going to your own death,
but those who ride with you will die, too.

476
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,120
Do you choose to remain here?

have rushed inside the gates

have been closed behind them.

00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,880
You seem so much...

527
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,120
Like someone I know.

528
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,400
I am a foolish old man
with foolish dreams.

529
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:19,600
So often have I dreamed that my son
would come back from Spain

530
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,320
and he would be like you.

531
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,920
Now that you are so close,

532
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,880
it is so much like my dreams.

533
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,600
I feel almost
that I could pull aside the mask,

534
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,160
and there would be the face
of my son, Diego.

535
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,520
(CHUCKLES WEAKLY)

536
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,360
I would not pull away the mask.

537
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,360
I would not have the courage.

538
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,400
An old man must cling to his dreams

539
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,480
as desperately as he clings to life.

540
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:01,840
You will have many years left, my father,
to live and dream.

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

542
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,000
Thank you.

543
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,320
It... It is a bad wound, SeÃ±or Zorro?

544
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,440
The bullet is still in there.

545
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,280
I do not have the means to remove it.

546
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,040
I will get word to your son, Diego.

547
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,240
He will come and take care of you.

-(GRUNTS)
-No, no, no. No, don't move.

549
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,040
It would only aggravate the wound.

550
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:00,760
Look, Comandante! That is the jacket
Don Alejandro was wearing when he escaped.

551
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,600
SÃ­, there is blood on it.

552
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,080

553
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,720

00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,760
I must destroy him...

557
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,040
Before he destroys us.

558
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,480
Bernardo, my father's been wounded.

559
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,000
Get what medications you can
and the implements to remove the shot.

560
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,400
He'll be all right
if he gets the care he needs.

561
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,040
I will sneak out of the cave and draw
the lancers away from here. Go quickly!

Look at him. There is the pig that tried
to raise the rancheros against me.

00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,920
Here, give me that.

No, SeÃ±or Zorro.

This is Sergeant Espinosa, under orders
from the Governor of Monterey.

588
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,600
He has guaranteed my safety.

589

Then you'll be good enough
to look after SeÃ±or de la Vega.

You are Zorro, the outlaw?

00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,120
He is my friend.
He saved me from Monastario.

I am CapitÃ¡n Monastario,
Comandante de pueblo de Los Angeles.

597
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,960
I will take charge
of all three of these prisoners.

598
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,360
I'm sorry. SeÃ±or Torres is under the
protection of the Governor of Monterey.

599
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,120
If he chooses to give safe conduct
to this gentleman, we will guard him also.

Do you, a mere sergeant, defy my orders?

I am merely obeying orders.

602
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,800
It is good to find someone
who can obey orders.

603
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,600
Perhaps, at last, justice
has come to California.

604
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,960
Does His Excellency, the Governor
also protect the outlaw, Zorro?

605
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:15,160
From what I have heard,
SeÃ±or Zorro does not need protection.

606
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,920
My orders are to provide
an escort, not to chase outlaws.

is your business.

not have treated us better.

that they were merely held as hostages
until my return.

for worry, my son.

to the Governor, I told him the truth.

631

He sent me back here under arrest

632
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,640
with orders to Monastario
that I was to be tried on the 14th,

that the Chief Magistrate of Monterey,

will arrive to preside at the trial...

Do we dare go through with it?
The Governor himself gave the order.

651
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,200
There were two communications.

652
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:53,680
One, an order to try Torres
and his fellow conspirators on the 14th,

653
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:56,920
the other, a notice that Judge Vasca would
arrive on the 14th,

654
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,600
and to cooperate with him fully.

655

But the chief judge must preside
at a trial if he is in the area.

656
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,680
Exactly. But Judge Vasca
will not be in the area.

And by the time he arrives,
the trial will have been concluded

and the bodies of Torres
and Alejandro de la Vega

659
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,080
will be evidence
that justice has been done.

660
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,520
But will Sergeant Garcia be
a party to such a thing?

661
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,840
Sergeant Garcia knows nothing.

662
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,240
You heard what I told him,

663
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,000
that we need more time to prepare
a welcome for Judge Vasca,

664
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,000
and to delay him until noon tomorrow.

665

Will he not put together
the trial and delaying the judge?

666

Ah, Sergeant Garcia could not put together
two pieces of bread to make a sandwich.

Well, Sergeant. Off in pursuit

His fame has spread even to Monterey.

773

He is a blackguard and a bandit.

Then why don't you put him
in your filthy cell instead of me?

775

Or can't you catch him?

776

I have not been able to catch him yet

777
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,000
because the people are protecting him.

778

They regard this scoundrel
as their friend.

who are their friend, eh?

780

I would choose for myself.

804
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:22,280
You will rob my guests,
even the poor ones,

805
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:24,440
and make it a point
to mistreat the servants.

806
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,680

807
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:28,480
or shall I cut off an ear or two?

808
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:29,840
Anything that pleases you.

809
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,960
We must discredit Zorro
with all classes.

810
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,960
Then they will cease to protect him,
and I will easily capture him.

811
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:38,000
After I have thoroughly proved
what a monster this Zorro is,

812
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:39,200
I am allowed to escape?

813
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,080
You will vanish in the night, a free man.

It is simple.

objects to being robbed?

defend your honor.

01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:47,160
(STAMMERS) No. No, thanks.
I think I should go now.

1049
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:48,600
Look!

1050
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:52,680
Why, it's a diamond.

1051
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:54,000
TAVERN MANAGER: Hey!

1052
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:56,400
Oh, there is no doubt at all.

1053
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:58,920
These must be some of the gems
stolen from the Mission.

1054
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:02,080
Zorro, the man who took them,

1055
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:04,080
could be somebody in this room.

1056
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:05,840
If you'll excuse me, SeÃ±or,

1057
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:07,560
I just remembered
I forgot something.

1058
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:22,160
First the ruby,
and then I looked down,

1059
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:24,240
and I saw the diamond
on the wench's tray!

1060
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:25,800
I do not understand it.

1061
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:27,480
I told you not to trust Martinez!

1062
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:29,520
Obviously he has not
followed my instructions,

1063
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:31,080
and this he will regret.

1064
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:32,880
You are looking for me, CapitÃ¡n?

1065
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:35,040
This part of the plan
you did not explain.

1066
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:37,520
You come to murder me
and take the gems for yourself.

1067
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:45,440
I am sure that man is Martinez.

1068
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:48,680
No, Bernardo,
he is very much alive.

If I did not value
my own life so highly,

1072
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:07,600
I would take time
to relieve you of yours.

1073
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:08,880
I make you a gift of it.

1074
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:15,200
I cannot allow Martinez to escape,

1075
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:16,880
even though the Comandante
is a witness.

1076
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:18,040
Wait here.

1077
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:26,480
What are you doing here,
de la Vega?

1078
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:27,960
Apparently, I am seeing a ghost.

1079
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:30,600
Do not try and stop him.
He will kill you with a single thrust!

1080
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:32,760
I believe that's the man who robbed
the Mission dressed as Zorro.

1081
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:34,280
I know my duty!

1082
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:44,080
Out of my way
or I'll cut you down!

1083
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:45,800
No. I'm going to see this through.

1084
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:47,600
Now, if you want to surrender,
give me your weapon.

1085
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:18,920
(CHUCKLES) My hat.

1086
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,680
You are about to lose your life!

1087
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:23,400
You are the luckiest swordsman alive.

1088
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:25,840
I have never seen a man so awkward
who lived so long.

1089
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:27,320
Awkward?

1091
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:42,360
You see, SeÃ±or, luck is not enough.

(GRUNTS)

1093
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:15,440
Why did you have to kill him?

1094
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:17,160
He was a dangerous criminal.

1095
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:19,320
Perhaps it would have been embarrassing

1096
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:21,560
to have had him captured
and questioned, eh?

1097
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:26,880
Why, it's the crown of jewels.

1098
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:29,680

1099
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:31,960
On, no. Nothing is wrong.

1100
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:34,160
I shall return this to Padre Felipe.

1101
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:37,000
And you would of course explain
that it was not Zorro who did this.

1102
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:38,960
Naturally.

1103
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:40,560
The people will owe a debt of gratitude

1104
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:41,840
to their comandante.

1105
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:43,680
Uh, just one moment.

1106
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:45,640
Would you permit me one question?

1107
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:49,680
How is it possible for Martinez
to have robbed the Mission

1108
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:52,200
when you already officially buried him?

1109
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:54,680
It was Sergeant Garcia
who made out that report.

1110
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:56,960
I will see that
he is properly disciplined.

1111
01:11:57,440 --> 01:12:00,480
Uh, and now permit me one question.

1112
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:02,160
How is it possible

1113
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:04,720
that the most inept swordsman
in all of California

1114
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:07,920
was able to defeat Martinez,
one of the best?

1115
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:11,240
Well, perhaps SeÃ±or Martinez was right

1116
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:13,800
when he said I am
the luckiest swordsman alive.

Enter.

Don Diego de la Vega,
as ordered, Comandante.

1121
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:25,080
If the Comandante is busy,
perhaps the Sergeant

1122
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:27,040
could arrest me at a more convenient time.

1123
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:28,640
Sergeant, close the door.

1124
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:31,120
-With me outside?
-With you inside.

1125
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:33,200
What I have to say
is of great interest, Sergeant.

1126
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:36,080
Everything the Comandante
has to say is of great interest.

1127
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:37,400
Sit down.

1128
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:40,760
I have here a list of Zorro's offenses.

1129
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:42,960
It's a rather long list, Comandante.

1130
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:44,440
I think you must have been working nights.

1131
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:46,840
One very interesting fact
has occurred to me

1132
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:48,320
about this list, de la Vega...

1133
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:52,160
Whenever Zorro struck,
you were always close at hand,

1134
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:54,680
yet, whenever Zorro actually appeared,

1135
01:12:54,760 --> 01:12:56,560
you were never seen.

1136
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:58,800
How do you account for that?

1137
01:12:58,880 --> 01:12:59,880
Well, I...

1138
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:01,120
Diego de la Vega,

1139
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:03,720
I arrest you in the name of the King.

1140
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:06,240
But I am already under arrest.

1141
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:08,320
You are Zorro!

1143
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:14,080
What are you laughing about, idiot?

1144
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:15,800
Your pardon, SeÃ±or Comandante,

1145
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:18,440
but in all of Los Angeles...
In the whole of California,

1146
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:20,760
there is no one less likely
to be Zorro than Don Diego.

1147
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:24,520
Precisely. Your disguise is too good.

1148
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:26,440

Sergeant, draw your saber.

1152
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:40,080
Now, keep it pointed at de la Vega.

1153
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:41,840
If he makes any move to escape,

1154
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:43,360
-run him through.
-But, Comandante...

1155
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:44,720

1164
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:03,720
but why here?

1165
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:06,120
Perhaps he just wants
to meet you, Comandante.

01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:08,800
-That is all.
-SÃ­, Comandante.

01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:17,760
It is my political enemies
spreading lies about me.

1169
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:20,040
Now, what possible lies
could they spread about you?

1170
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:23,120
That I am incompetent and...
Never mind about the lies!

1171
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:25,000
It is all your fault, SeÃ±or Zorro.

1172
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:28,920
Yes. You are here at an opportune time.

1173
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,680
I will publicly clean up
the only blot on my rule here.

1174
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:35,120
Sergeant, I want a joyous reception
for the Viceroy.

1175
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:36,720
Joyous, CapitÃ¡n?

Empty? The jail is packed
like a keg full of dried fish.

1180
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:45,360
Then empty it.

1181
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:48,040
I declare an amnesty in honor
of the Viceroy's visit.

1182

All will receive free wine at the tavern,

1183

and they are to appear
cheerful and prosperous.

1184
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:54,840
When the Viceroy arrives,
they are to cheer spontaneously.

1185
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:56,200
Is that clear, Sergeant?

1186
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:58,080
Clear, Comandante.
But how do you force the people

1187
01:14:58,160 --> 01:14:59,400
to be cheerful against their will?

1188
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:00,960
MONASTARIO: That is
your responsibility, Sergeant.

1189
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:04,320
But I want them cheerful,
even if you have to shoot them.

1190
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:06,800
The Viceroy will find this a model pueblo.

1191
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:08,400
Quickly. You have very little time.

1192
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:11,160

In fact, we are about a year too late.

1193
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:14,720
And as for you, SeÃ±or Zorro,

1194
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:17,480
you will remain here

I see we have gallantry
at even the most remote outposts.

I've been reading reports
on this pueblo, CapitÃ¡n.

about the contented people.

than I had anticipated.

01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:36,920
If only we'd been given
warning of your arrival,

1220
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:40,200
we could have prepared a proper reception
with flowers and display.

1221
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:42,960
The flowers CapitÃ¡n Monastario
omitted at our reception

1222
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:44,160
blossom on his tongue.

1223
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:46,320
Here, Your Excellency, is our prison.

1224
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:48,720
But the reports and the records I read...

1225
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:50,560
I do not deny that
there was a great deal of crime

1226
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:51,840
when I took over the pueblo.

1227
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:54,240
But, possibly, the reports were written
by those who were in command

1228
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:55,840
before I was appointed comandante.

1229
01:16:56,160 --> 01:16:59,040
I am certainly glad
I decided to make this trip myself.

1230
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:00,720
I, too, Your Excellency.

1231
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:02,480
I shall look more carefully
into the reports.

1232
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:05,160
They spoke of problems
amounting almost to rebellion.

1233
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:08,640
And what of this outlaw...
What is his name? Zorro, the fox?

1234
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:10,520
Is he as false as the rest of the charges?

1235
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:12,440
Uh, no, Your Excellency.

1236
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:14,960
The lesser forms of crime
were easy to stamp out,

1237
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:17,600
but Zorro is as clever
as the very devil himself.

1238
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:19,960
But I will have more to say
on that subject later.

1239
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:21,680
Please pardon me while I make arrangements

1240
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:24,080
for a suitable suite
and servants for you at the inn.

1241
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:25,160
(SPEAKS SPANISH)

1242
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:29,520
How does our comandante strike you?

1243
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:31,240
As a pompous fool.

1244
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:33,360
He seemed very attracted to you.

1245
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:35,080
Yes, unfortunately.

1246
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:38,040
(FLAMENCO MUSIC PLAYING)

1247
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:17,720
ALL: OlÃ©, olÃ©!

1248
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:22,960
OlÃ©, olÃ©, olÃ©!

1249
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:25,120
Quite accomplished. Very attractive.

1250
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:27,160
Yes, but contrasted with real beauty,

1251
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:29,720
oh, it is difficult to concentrate
on anything else.

1252
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:31,120
Oh, I trust I give no offense.

1253
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:33,320
After such an excellent meal,
and such gallantry,

1254
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:34,960
who could take offense?

1255
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:36,760
Caballeros, a toast.

1256
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:40,880
Excellency, Godspeed
and good journey tomorrow,

1257
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:42,800
and I trust the rest
of your tour of inspection

1258
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:45,640
will bring you as much happiness
as your visit has brought us.

1259
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:47,480
Thank you.

1260
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:49,880
It has been an extremely
instructive evening, CapitÃ¡n.

1261
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,080
Most enlightening.

1262
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:54,000
But now that the hour is growing late,
and we must rise early,

1263
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:56,640
I want to thank you for the entertainment
and bid you all good night.

1264
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:57,840
Gentlemen.

1265
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:00,320
Sergeant...

1266
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:02,400
Bring in de la Vega. Quickly.

1267
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:09,800
Thank you, SeÃ±or. A delightful evening.

1268
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:11,760
Excellency, you have been so patient.

1269
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:13,920
I beg you grant me a few moments more.

1270
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,760
I have been saving a surprise for you.

1271
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:18,240
The comandante
is full of surprises, Father.

1272
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:21,120
When I told you that I had stamped out
all crime in Los Angeles,

1273
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:22,360
it was only partly true.

1274
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:23,840
Indeed. Only partly?

1275
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:26,480
But, Your Excellency,
I have the honor to announce that,

1276
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:29,400
at this very moment, Zorro is my prisoner.

1277
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:30,720
You have actually captured Zorro?

1278
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:33,320
I have just sent for him.
So that you may all see him unmasked.

1279
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:34,560
This should prove to be exciting.

1280
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:36,640
I thought you said this fox
outwitted your soldiers.

1281
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:39,840
But my soldiers, Excellency,
represent only military force.

1282
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:42,840
But you do not catch a fox
by brute strength, but by cunning.

1283
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:46,320
As you'll see, Your Excellency,

1284
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:48,320
I have brought a fox to Earth.

1285
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:49,920
Come with me, Sergeant.

1286
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:54,600
Stand here.

1287
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:56,680
Your Excellency, I will not trouble you

1288
01:19:56,760 --> 01:19:58,920
with a list of this man's
crimes against the crown.

1289
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,720
You know them from the official reports.

1290
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,600
Enough to hang him a dozen times over.

1291
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:03,960
We need but one hanging,

1292
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:07,000
and I propose we celebrate that tonight
in Your Excellency's presence.

1293
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:08,720
You say that this man is a turncoat?

1294
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:11,040
Of the worst sort, Your Excellency.

1295
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:13,920
A man who held a respected
position in this community.

1296
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,480
With your permission...

1297
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:20,000
MAN 1: De la Vega!
MAN 2: Don Diego.

1298
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:21,840
Father, it's Diego!

1299
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:25,200
Oh, no, no, no.
There must be some mistake!

1300
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:26,880
Actually, I'm very flattered.

1301
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:29,600
But I'm afraid the Comandante
is suffering from a delusion.

1302
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:31,480
It is a pleasure to see you both again.

1303
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:35,560
(STAMMERS) You...
You know this man, Your Excellency?

1304
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:37,040
Why, of course we do.

1305
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:39,560
Diego and my son
went to the same university in Spain.

1306
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:41,080
We are very good friends.

1307
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:43,920
CapitÃ¡n Monastario, is this accusation
your idea of a joke?

1308
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:46,320
(STAMMERING) No, Your Excellency.

1309
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:48,280
It is no joke.

1310
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:51,400
Diego de la Vega
is the infamous outlaw Zorro.

1311
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:53,840
But what reason would Diego
have to turn outlaw?

1312
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:56,480
The de la Vegas are the wealthiest
landowners in California.

1313
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:59,400
If to turn outlaw
means to fight his tyranny,

1314
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:00,480
there is reason enough.

1315
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:02,200
Zorro has all of my sympathy.

1316
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:05,520
Unfortunately, I...
Well, I do not share his abilities.

1317
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:09,960
SeÃ±or Alcalde, you have been witness
to Zorro's misdeeds against the crown?

1318
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:12,120
-SÃ­.
-You've had a good look at him?

1319
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:14,000
-SÃ­.
-Is this man not Zorro?

1320
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:18,320
I... I am not sure.

1321
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:21,080
In this costume, he looks like him.

1322
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:23,840
Sergeant, you have my permission
to speak freely.

1323
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:27,080
De la Vega submitted without protest
when you arrested, did he not?

1324
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:28,840
SÃ­, Comandante, but...

1325
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:31,200
You, Licenciado Pina,

1326
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:33,200
you have seen this bandit at close range.

1327
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:36,160
Can you not identify
this prisoner as Zorro?

1328
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:37,680
Yes.

1329
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:41,240
I am positive, Your Excellency,
this man, without a doubt, is Zorro!

1330
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:45,880
Don Esteban,
would you permit me one favor, please?

1331
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:46,960
What is it?

1332
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:48,240
Send the comandante out

1333
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:51,400
to, uh, cool his befuddled head
while I have a word with you.

1334
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:53,920
Whatever the prisoner has to say
can be said in my presence.

1335
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,440
Do not worry, Comandante,
I will not try to escape.

1336
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:58,240
It seems to be a reasonable request.

1337
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:02,080
Will you be responsible for him?

1338
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:03,480
Yes, I will.

1339
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:06,960
Very well, I...
I bow to your wishes, Excellency.

1340
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:08,840
Come with me, Sergeant.

1341
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:15,880
Guard the windows
and watch the roof and balcony.

1342
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:17,840
If he makes a run for it, cut him down.

1343
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:19,120
Has Zorro escaped already?

1344
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:20,560
No, boboso.

1345
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:23,480
It is such a pleasure
to call someone else that.

1346
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:26,080
I wonder what lies de la Vega
is telling the Viceroy.

1347
01:22:26,160 --> 01:22:28,520
The evidence against him is overwhelming.

1348
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:31,080
Certainly, the Viceroy
must realize he is guilty.

1349
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:34,080
The seÃ±orita seemed quite
anxious about him, CapitÃ¡n.

1350
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:35,400
Hardly anxious.

1351
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:37,880
It is merely difficult
for her to believe the facts.

1352
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:41,920
Besides, you must have noticed that
the seÃ±orita seems quite smitten with me.

1353
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,560
Ah, you think so?

1354
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:46,040
Well, is this so difficult to understand?

1355
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:49,680
Look at me, Sergeant.
You find me... Attractive?

1356
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:51,040
No.

1357
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:53,520
No, you idiot, I mean, if...
If you were a woman!

1358
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:57,200
If I was a woman and fat like this,
I wouldn't be particular.

1359
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:58,360
Oh.

1360
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:00,440
Marriage between
the Viceroy's daughter and I

1361
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:03,360
would be mutually advantageous,
don't you think so?

1362
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:06,320
It would certainly be
a quick way of becoming a colonel.

1363
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:08,080
Get inside and see what is going on.

1364
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:09,840
SÃ­, CapitÃ¡n.

1365
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:17,880
Everything seems quiet, Comandante.

1366
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:19,040
Eh, too quiet.

1367
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:21,000
His Excellency wishes you to return.

1368
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:22,120
Oh.

1369
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:29,920
CapitÃ¡n Monastario, I have no doubt
as to your earnest intentions.

1370
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Thank you, Your Excellency.

1371
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:34,360
However, Diego tells me
that you provided him with this disguise.

1372
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:36,920
It is identical
with the costume Zorro always wears.

1373
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,360
In all fairness to my young friend,

1374
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:40,320
I ask you to look
very carefully at this disguise

1375
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:42,360
and tell me if you could not be mistaken.

1376
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:44,400
No, Your Excellency, I'm not mistaken.

1377
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:47,520
But any man wearing this cloak and mask
might be mistaken for Zorro.

1378
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:50,400
You've already heard a positive
identification that this man is Zorro.

1379
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:53,800
That is true, but this disguise
does conceal most of his features.

1380
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:56,560
Another man might have
the same build as de la Vega,

1381
01:23:56,640 --> 01:23:58,320
another man might be the same height,

1382
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:00,840
another man might even wear
a mustache such as his.

1383
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:03,400
But it is too much to expect
all of these qualifications

1384
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:04,480
in the same person.

1385
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:07,840
No, Your Excellency.
Without a doubt, this man is Zorro.

1386
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:10,040
No one could ask

1387
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:12,120
for a more positive
identification than that.

1388
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:22,760
CapitÃ¡n, this lancer put on
the costume on my orders.

1389
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:24,640
No harm is to come to him.

1390
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:26,240
But de la Vega is Zorro!

1391
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:27,720
This is another one of his tricks!

1392
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:28,800
You were just as positive

1393
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:30,800
when you identified this soldier
a few moments ago.

1394
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:35,800
But I know de la Vega is guilty.

1395
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:39,720
He poses as a poet,
a weakling, an inept swordsman.

1396
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:41,800
Yet, the other day
I saw him duel an expert

1397
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:44,080
and vanquish him when he
thought he was unobserved.

1398
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:46,400
The Comandante is more
confused than I'd imagined.

1399
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:48,880
Why, this is becoming
an obsession with him.

1400
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:50,640
The Comandante has not been well.

1401
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:52,560
This matter of Zorro...
He has hardly slept.

1402
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:55,960
Shut up, you idiot.

1403
01:24:56,040 --> 01:24:58,040
I do not need your advice or help.

1404
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:02,360
You have made a fool of me once too often.

1405
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:04,320
You give me too much credit, Comandante.

1406
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:06,680
It takes no skill at all
to make a fool of you.

1407
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:10,080
If I cannot appeal
to the Viceroy's reasoning,

1408
01:25:10,160 --> 01:25:12,920
then I will appeal
to the de la Vega honor.

1409
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:16,720
I demand satisfaction.

1410
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:20,040
Very well.

1411
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:21,520
Sword, please.

1412
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:26,560
Gloves.

1413
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:29,360
MONASTARIO: Innkeeper! Clear the room.

1414
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:32,040
SeÃ±or Comandante,
if you must fight, please fight outside.

1415
01:25:32,120 --> 01:25:34,440
Idiot. Lancers, get the table
and chairs out of here.

1416
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:35,520
Quickly.

1417
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:46,680
And now we shall show His Excellency
your ability with the blade.

1418
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:49,680
Fight well, for I am going to kill you!

1419
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:57,840
(LAUGHS MALICIOUSLY)

1420
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:14,600
(GRUNTS)

1421
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:20,280
Father, you must stop them!

1422
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:22,280
No, no, no. Diego knows what he's doing.

1423
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:24,600
(BOTH GRUNTING)

1424
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:36,560
I shall force you to reveal yourself.

1425
01:26:36,640 --> 01:26:38,240
What, as a poor swordsman?

1426
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:39,640
Everyone knows that.

1427
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:49,840
(YELPS)

1428
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:58,640
(YELPS)

1429
01:27:04,760 --> 01:27:05,760
(SCREAMS)

1430
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:13,640
(GRUNTS)

1431
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:16,800
(GRUNTS)

1432
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:29,680
(GRUNTS)

1433
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:44,680
Diego, that is enough! Stop!

1434
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:48,200
Now, admit you are Zorro,

1435
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:50,960
or your throat will never
utter another sound.

1436
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:53,400
I give you one last chance.

1437
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,080
GUARD: It's Zorro! Lancers, to arms!

1438
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:27,480
"Sorry to have missed your fiesta. Zorro."

1439
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:48,520
You put on a very convincing show,
CapitÃ¡n Monastario.

1440
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:49,920
But I had all the evidence I needed

1441
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,320
against you and Licenciado Pina
before I came here.

1442
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:53,920
You take the word of my enemies?

1443
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,400
It seems that nearly everyone
in California is your enemy.

1444
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:58,520
You're both under arrest. Take them away.

1445
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:01,720
Diego, I knew you could not be this Zorro.

1446
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:03,480
Oh, thank you, sir.

1447
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:05,720
-Sergeant Garcia.
-Yes, sir.

1448
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:07,080
You will take over
command of this garrison

1449
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:08,320
until a new officer is appointed.

1450
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:09,400
Yes, Excellency.

1451
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:14,560
Yes, sir, Your Excellency!

1452
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:17,160
Your Excellency, you will find

1453
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:20,200
you have not made a mistake
appointing me comandante.

1454
01:29:20,280 --> 01:29:21,520
DON ESTEBAN: It's a pleasure.

1455
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:26,360
Comandante, your hat.

1456
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:28,920
Gracias, Don Diego! (LAUGHS)

1457
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,680
And now,
what is your first order of the day?

1458
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:33,080
My first order...

1459
01:29:34,160 --> 01:29:37,400
I declare a holiday
in honor of my promotion.

1460
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:39,320
(LAUGHS) Bravo!

1461
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:40,920
(ALL LAUGHING)
