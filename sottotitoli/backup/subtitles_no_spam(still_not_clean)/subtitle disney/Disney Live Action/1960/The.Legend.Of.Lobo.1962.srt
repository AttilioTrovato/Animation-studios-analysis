like everything else,

20
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:17,331
a good legend's got
to have a good beginning.

21
00:03:17,365 --> 00:03:19,600
The right bloodline,
you might say.

22
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:22,703
This one began
even before lobo's time...

23
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:25,939
With a wolf famous
in his own right.

24
00:03:25,973 --> 00:03:30,544
He was a big, rangy fella.
He used to roam a wide piece of the territory...

25
00:03:30,578 --> 00:03:35,716
Back when it was still empty
and mighty fine to look at.

26
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:38,852
Around the neighborhood,
he was known as the fierce one.

27
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:42,356
In the local Spanish, El feroz.

28
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:45,293
The vaqueros had a great deal
of respect for him too.

29
00:03:45,326 --> 00:03:48,462
Fact is, it amounted
to a kind of a superstition.

30
00:03:48,496 --> 00:03:52,366
Some of 'em claimin'
he was a spirit wolf.

31
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,636
Well, this El feroz
was lobo's father.

32
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:59,773
So for breed and blood,
lobo came from a good line.

33
00:03:59,807 --> 00:04:02,776
It was in the spring of '89
he was born,

34
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:06,347
a litter of five pups,
two brothers and a couple of sisters.

35
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:10,351
That's about
the usual family for wolves.

36
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:17,291
Now, these young 'uns are off to a good start on a number of counts.

37
00:04:17,325 --> 00:04:21,629
For one thing,
they were lucky just havin' El feroz for their dad.

38
00:04:21,662 --> 00:04:26,900
It's a common thing in nature for the male animal to kill his offspring,

39
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:28,902
if he can get to 'em.

40
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:32,906
But the wolf's different.
He's about the best parent there is,

41
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,377
because he's gentle
with his young.

42
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:42,650
The wolf's loyal too.

43
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:46,454
Somethin' most folks don't realize is that wolves mate for life.

44
00:04:46,487 --> 00:04:48,722
It's for all time.

45
00:04:48,756 --> 00:04:53,694
The male and the female both being
devoted to each other and the family.

46
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:56,630
For a real fine
domestic arrangement,

47
00:04:56,664 --> 00:05:00,901
there's probably not another one
like it anywhere in nature.

48
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:07,841
At six weeks of age,
lobo wasn't much of a legend,

49
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:10,378
not yet anyway.

50
00:05:10,411 --> 00:05:12,646
He was bright-eyed
and full of mischief,

51
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,783
but he looked exactly
like his brothers and sisters.

52
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:20,354
And at this stage of the game,
nobody would have bet on him as a future king of the range.

53
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:26,894
About the only thing
different maybe,

54
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:29,897
he was a little more curious
than the rest of the litter.

55
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:33,434
He sort of liked
to follow his nose,

56
00:05:33,467 --> 00:05:36,737
find out what is goin' on
around the neighborhood.

57
00:05:38,806 --> 00:05:43,544
But bein' a little new at this,
he sometimes followed it too far.

58
00:05:57,024 --> 00:06:00,861
Well, if you're gonna leave your common
sense at home when you go travelin',

59
00:06:00,894 --> 00:06:03,531
you're bound to land in trouble.

60
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:16,176
Still, the school of hard knocks isn't a bad place to start an education,

61
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:19,747
and lobo caught on fast.

62
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:24,051
The truth was, all of his life,
he'd be one to learn from experience...

63
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:28,422
And, what's more important,
store it up and remember it.

64
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:33,994
By now it was plain that
the pups were growin' fast...

65
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:36,797
And about ready
for good red meat.

66
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:41,435
So El feroz checked over his boneyard to see what was left.

67
00:07:07,495 --> 00:07:10,531
The bone he finally dug up
was the last one.

68
00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:14,635
Pretty slim pickin's
for a hungry family.

69
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:18,939
About all it was good for
was a tug-of-war.

70
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:22,543
There wasn't enough nourishment in this old soup bone to feed a canary.

71
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:30,584
El feroz knew it was time
to go huntin' again.

72
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:42,195
♪ He'll feed
his hungry young ones ♪

73
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:48,168

Pronghorn antelope,

80
00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:40,253
♪ His family would be fed

81
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:53,567
An antelope's faster than
a jackrabbit on the takeoff,

82
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:56,937
but he can't keep it up forever.

83
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,673
The wolf, on the other hand,
is a stayer.

84
00:08:59,707 --> 00:09:03,010
He can hold the pace for hours
on end when he wants to.

85
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:05,813
He can even outlast
a good strong horse.

86
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:09,082
So this is how it was.

87
00:09:09,116 --> 00:09:13,821
El feroz was countin' on
one of the herd fallin' behind.

88
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:38,846
Sure enough,
a big pronghorn buck pulled up winded and heavin',

89
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:41,982
too tired to go another step.

90
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:50,691
Now the chase was over.
The rest would be easy,

91
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:55,362
except that El feroz wasn't in a hurry to move in for the kill.

92
00:09:57,798 --> 00:10:01,101
He began to work this antelope
like a good cuttin' horse,

93
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:04,304
headin' it back in the direction
they had come.

94
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:06,774
This was an old, old trick.

95
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:10,377
If a wolf chased his prey miles away from where he wanted it...

96
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:13,714
Say, a half day's journey
from a hungry family...

97
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:17,718
He didn't end things too soon.

98
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:21,288
Instead, he'd send it along home
under its own power.

99
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:34,167
Back at the den,
these little young 'uns were bein' as patient as they could,

100
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:39,239
exceptin' it wasn't natural for pups to
be very patient when they were hungry.

101
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:42,342
They growled a little,
grumbled a little,

102
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:47,047
chewed on things and generally
felt sorry for themselves.

103
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,851
If they'd only known it,
they really had somethin' to complain about.

104
00:10:50,884 --> 00:10:53,854
A cougar was pokin' around
in their vicinity.

105
00:10:53,887 --> 00:10:56,456
And if he found 'em,
it could mean trouble.

106
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,026
Real bad trouble.

107
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:06,433
When one of these big cats was circulatin',
nothin' was safe.

108
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:11,972
Stealthy, tricky,

109
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:15,943
he'd sneak up soft and silent,
never betrayin' his presence,

110
00:11:15,976 --> 00:11:18,011
never givin' a warning either.

111
00:11:48,275 --> 00:11:51,812
Seemed like right about now,
the wolves had been dealt a losing hand.

112
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:57,517
Then at the last minute,
a wild card turned up.

113
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:17,971
There was somethin' about
cougars that just naturally...

114
00:12:18,005 --> 00:12:20,841
Brought out hatred
in cowpunchers.

115
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:24,477
Of course,
the big cats were death on horses and other livestock,

116
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:27,114
but the resentment
seemed more than that almost.

117
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:32,252
It was kind of unreasoning,
and it generally took the form of a rifle bullet.

118
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:35,188
Now, this went for wolves too.

119
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:38,458
And right at this moment,
little lobo couldn't know how close he was...

120
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:41,428
To gettin' a lead slug
of his own.

121
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:55,342
About that time, El feroz
came home with part of his kill.

122
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:58,778
Right off, he knew
somethin' was wrong.

123
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:12,492
It didn't take him long
to unravel the mystery.

124
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:15,996
He could have figured it out
by the scent alone...

125
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:21,001
And catchin' sight of the riders
only confirmed his conclusions.

126
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:23,971
Humans had been here,
and they'd probably be back.

127
00:13:24,004 --> 00:13:27,975
It was time to pull up stakes
and move on.

128
00:13:28,008 --> 00:13:32,379
When the whereabouts of a wolf's den isn't secret anymore,

129
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:35,215
he'll find himself a new one,

130
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:39,052
'cause the one thing
he's got to have is privacy.

131
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:46,026
Of course, when that day comes,
father just acts as guide.

132
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:49,897
It's mother who does
all the totin' and carryin'.

133
00:13:56,303 --> 00:13:59,306
All right, dear. Get a move on.
Let's get goin'.

134
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:26,033
Since there was only room
for one passenger at a time,

135
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:28,902
each of the pups
had to wait his turn,

136
00:14:28,936 --> 00:14:32,405
but lobo wasn't
in the mood for waitin'.

137
00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:36,676
Like a stray on the tail end of the herd,
he came taggin' along behind,

138
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:40,580
doin' his best to keep up.

139
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:32,532
It was gettin' plainer every minute that he wasn't any mountain goat.

140
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:37,204
But if he wanted it this way,
his mother seemed willing to let him work it out.

141
00:15:42,142 --> 00:15:44,644
He wasn't a quitter.
No, sir.

142
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:49,316
He stayed with it, and in the end,
he came out on top.

143
00:15:53,753 --> 00:15:57,257
Now, once on the trail,
the parents moved along at a steady lope.

144
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,426
It was a little tough
on the pups,

145
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:03,430
bein' short coupled with
short legs tryin' to keep up.

146
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:07,267
Now, there was no time
for the sights,

147
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,436
no time to fool around
with strangers.

148
00:16:17,744 --> 00:16:22,482
Bein' the curious one,
lobo stopped to say howdy.

149
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,431
The tortoise wasn't much
on hospitality.

150
00:16:38,465 --> 00:16:41,701
He just wanted to mind
his own business.

151
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:45,338
Trouble was, he was gettin'
a lot of unwanted help.

152
00:16:47,307 --> 00:16:50,143
Finally figurin'
to sidetrack his escort,

153
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:55,048
the old slowpoke
veered off the trail.

154
00:16:55,082 --> 00:16:58,017
The sashayin' was over,
but the pup was a little late gettin' the point.

155
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:13,800
By now lobo had forgotten all about his parents.
It was sort of mutual.

156
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:18,305
Being concerned with house hunting,
they had their minds on other things too.

157
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:24,444
The pup, meanwhile, had
taken up with a new sidekick,

158
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:28,448
another funny-looking critter
in a suit of armor.

159
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:30,450
Seemed like everybody
around here wore it.

160
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:34,287
Maybe this is what made 'em
all so standoffish.

161
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,669
Well, in a matter
of bein' friendly,

162
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:53,406
lobo decided it was up to him
to make the first move.

163
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,176
Now, an armadillo's
got tender ears,

164
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:59,346
about the only thing on him
that's unprotected.

165
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:03,850
Hurt his ears and you've
hurt his feelings, for sure.

166
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:25,405
All this time the family had been coverin' more and more ground,

167
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,874
gettin' farther
and farther away,

168
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:30,710
and still they
hadn't missed lobo.

169
00:18:32,512 --> 00:18:36,149
So at a rather young age,
he was left playin' lone wolf...

170
00:18:36,183 --> 00:18:37,750
And findin' it a bit tedious.

171
00:18:40,887 --> 00:18:44,191
He was hot, tired and thirsty.

172
00:18:44,224 --> 00:18:48,728
To make matters worse,
his feet hurt.

173
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,599
It kind of dawned on him
along about this point...

174
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:55,302
That he was
travelin' in circles.

175
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:59,872
He was lost, just about
as lost as they come.

176
00:18:59,906 --> 00:19:04,877
Purely by accident,
he stumbled onto a catch basin of rainwater.

177
00:19:04,911 --> 00:19:09,216
Just enough left for a quick drink and a soothing cooling bath...

178
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:11,218
For his achin' feet.

179
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:24,331
His wet tracks would have been
easy to follow...

180
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:28,335
If anybody'd come along in time,
but that wasn't likely.

181
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:33,240
The family was a couple of canyons away
before they hauled up to count noses.

182
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:36,743
Now, wolves don't excite easy.

183
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:39,879
The fact that a pup
was missin' didn't mean much.

184
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:43,350
They figured he was still
bringin' up the rear as usual,

185
00:19:43,383 --> 00:19:46,586
and he'd be along
in his own good time.

186
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:53,993
In makin' his rounds,
El feroz had had his eye for quite a spell...

187
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,629
On a deserted badger hole.

188
00:19:56,663 --> 00:19:59,866
With a little fixin',
it'd do just fine for a den,

189
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:02,635
so he took possession.

190
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:08,275
[Animal snarling,
feroz growling]

191
00:20:08,308 --> 00:20:10,843
It appeared the place
wasn't vacant, after all.

192
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:14,947
Tenant was livin' here,

193
00:20:14,981 --> 00:20:18,918
and he wasn't figurin' to move.

194
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:26,459
Badger's a tough critter
to handle, even for a wolf,

195
00:20:26,493 --> 00:20:28,761
and this one wasn't
gonna budge for anybody.

196
00:20:45,044 --> 00:20:48,615
He might be small,
but he was fast on his feet...

197
00:20:48,648 --> 00:20:51,351
And dead game.

198
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:54,020
Fact is, it turned out
to be quite a dance.

199
00:20:54,053 --> 00:20:58,257
Heel-and-toe and do-si-do
all around the hall.

200
00:21:53,746 --> 00:21:56,516
Finally, El feroz
decided to call it quits.

201
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:59,519
He wasn't gettin' anywhere
in this game.

202
00:21:59,552 --> 00:22:01,854
Besides, he had a lost pup
to worry about,

203
00:22:01,888 --> 00:22:05,458
and it was time
he went lookin' for him.

204
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:08,094
The first move was
to try to pick up his trail.

205
00:22:09,962 --> 00:22:12,899
It would still be fresh enough to follow if the parents could find it,

206
00:22:12,932 --> 00:22:15,935
but that was the big "if."

207
00:22:25,545 --> 00:22:29,616
They tried callin' to him
the old pack rallyin' cry,

208
00:22:29,649 --> 00:22:32,018
hopin' he'd hear it
and know enough to answer it.

209
00:22:36,489 --> 00:22:41,394
There wasn't even an echo,
nothin' but silence.

210
00:22:43,963 --> 00:22:47,800
One thing was certain.
They'd better catch up with him soon,

211
00:22:47,834 --> 00:22:49,736
'cause lobo
was courtin' disaster.

212
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:56,643
A rattler has a built-in warning system
for those who know what it means.

213
00:22:56,676 --> 00:23:01,380
But bein' a greenhorn,
lobo didn't get the message.

214
00:23:16,028 --> 00:23:19,766
Sensing he was in danger,
he began to call for help.

215
00:23:24,837 --> 00:23:28,541
Lucky for him,
his parents were within earshot.

216
00:23:38,184 --> 00:23:42,054
It didn't take long to size up
the situation.

217
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:44,190
They knew exactly what to do.

218
00:23:44,223 --> 00:23:46,626
Draw the snake's attention
to themselves.

219
00:23:55,034 --> 00:23:58,471
If they could just
keep the rattler busy,

220
00:23:58,505 --> 00:24:01,808
the pup might
slip out of the danger zone.

221
00:24:01,841 --> 00:24:06,078
Trouble with this plan,
the way out was squeezed a little narrow.

222
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:08,681
Besides, would the pup know
when to come?

223
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:21,260
From the sidelines, El feroz
could see it was a standoff,

224
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:24,697
and he decided
it needed a quick ending.

225
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:36,075
Once the rattler was rooted out,
his play was over.

226
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:39,512
Now lobo could
rejoin his family,

227
00:24:39,546 --> 00:24:42,214
sore-footed and
tuckered out maybe,

228
00:24:42,248 --> 00:24:45,585
but glad to be back
where he belonged.

229
00:24:51,057 --> 00:24:55,762
As the weeks went by,
lobo branched out more and more on his own,

230
00:24:55,795 --> 00:25:00,667
traipsing around
exploring the countryside.

231
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,169
One fine mornin',
he was amblin' along...

232
00:25:03,202 --> 00:25:05,538
Not doin' much of anything,

233
00:25:05,572 --> 00:25:07,812
when he came upon a sight
that stopped him in his tracks.

234
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:23,590
A young antelope
was feelin' his oats.

235
00:25:25,091 --> 00:25:27,760
He didn't seem to mind
where he was goin'...

236
00:25:27,794 --> 00:25:30,196
Just so long as
he got there in a jiffy.

237
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,807
He was a kind of
a crazy little cuss,

238
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,343
rambunctious
and full of the old vinegar.

239
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,946
To watch him
knock this pup around,

240
00:25:46,979 --> 00:25:49,816
you'd think he'd never heard
of wolves eatin' antelopes.

241
00:25:49,849 --> 00:25:51,684
Well, like as not at his age,
he hadn't.

242
00:26:19,111 --> 00:26:23,282
These two weren't old enough to know
they were supposed to be enemies,

243
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:26,619
so an unusual friendship
developed,

244
00:26:26,653 --> 00:26:30,823
one of those things that
sometimes happens in nature.

245
00:26:30,857 --> 00:26:34,961
In the weeks that followed,
they sort of grew up together.

246
00:26:34,994 --> 00:26:40,232
And when they were three months old,
they were still goin' around as pals.

247
00:26:43,002 --> 00:26:46,706
Often as not, their trail
led to their favorite hangout,

248
00:26:46,739 --> 00:26:49,709
a little creek runnin'
through the neighborhood.

249
00:26:49,742 --> 00:26:54,246
It was a real inviting spot for a couple of dry country young 'uns.

250
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:57,083
And they didn't need to be told
what a swimmin' hole was for.

251
00:27:23,409 --> 00:27:27,379
Naturally, the pup
favored the dog paddle.

252
00:27:27,413 --> 00:27:30,983
The other fella's style
wasn't as neat maybe,

253
00:27:31,017 --> 00:27:34,987
but it got him where
he was goin' just the same.

254
00:27:35,021 --> 00:27:37,690
While all this was goin' on,

255
00:27:37,724 --> 00:27:40,226
they were being spied on
by a non-too-friendly raccoon.

256
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:44,396
She kind of took the attitude that water belonged to water critters...

257
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:48,034
And not to landlubbers
like these.

258
00:28:11,357 --> 00:28:14,493
The raccoon had a family
to worry about, too,

259
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:17,864
and that tended to make her
leery of strangers.

260
00:28:17,897 --> 00:28:20,833
Nups are like that though.

261
00:28:20,867 --> 00:28:23,870
The kids couldn't see anything
wrong with the visitors.

262
00:28:23,903 --> 00:28:28,174
If it was to be a swimmin' party,
they'd join in right now.

263
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,947
Three of 'em would anyway.

264
00:28:34,981 --> 00:28:39,418
The fourth one... well,
it took him a little longer to make the plunge.

265
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,856
Whenever you get a passel
of small fry together,

266
00:29:16,889 --> 00:29:20,259
it's about the same in nature
as with humans.

267
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:24,530
After a while,
their animal energy is apt to bust out in a squabble.

268
00:29:46,052 --> 00:29:50,256
So the party ended,
and wolf and antelope moved on.

269
00:29:52,024 --> 00:29:56,495
Something else had ended too:
Their unusual friendship.

270
00:29:56,528 --> 00:30:00,332
It's just not natural for enemies to prolong an acquaintance.

271
00:30:00,366 --> 00:30:03,535
And as it had
to be in such things,

272
00:30:03,569 --> 00:30:06,272
these two came to the fork
in the trail.

273
00:30:10,276 --> 00:30:12,478
By the time
he was six months old,

274
00:30:12,511 --> 00:30:15,915
lobo was ready to run
with the family pack.

275
00:30:17,917 --> 00:30:22,955
He was bigger now, heavier,
more like his dad in every way.

276
00:30:22,989 --> 00:30:28,194
Every way except one,
he wasn't much help yet with the hunting.

277
00:30:29,595 --> 00:30:32,298
To El feroz, meantime,

278
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:37,103
it seemed the hungrier his family got,
the scarcer the game got.

279
00:30:37,136 --> 00:30:40,372
More and more civilization
was pushing into the parts,

280
00:30:40,406 --> 00:30:43,910
killing off his prey
or crowdin' it out.

281
00:31:03,062 --> 00:31:07,266

289
00:32:05,024 --> 00:32:08,260
Makin' a kill wasn't
exactly easy though.

290
00:32:08,294 --> 00:32:11,998
It was a tricky business,
even downright dangerous.

291
00:32:12,031 --> 00:32:17,036
If the timing was off,
a wolf could get himself kicked senseless.

292
00:32:17,069 --> 00:32:20,639
And if the set-to was a challenge for El feroz,
the old master,

293
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:22,641
it was somethin'
more than that for his pups.

294
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:27,446
Just when lobo thought
he had the thing down pat,

295
00:32:27,479 --> 00:32:32,651
he found himself with a bull by the tail and afraid to let go.

296
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:36,022
What in blazes do ya do now?

297
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:49,701
About that time the calf had sense enough to join the rest of 'em.

298
00:32:49,735 --> 00:32:53,705
And now it had protection
that was gonna be hard to beat.

299
00:32:53,739 --> 00:32:59,045
El feroz kept dancin' around,
keepin' his eye on the calf.

300
00:32:59,078 --> 00:33:01,313
For one thing,
it was nearer his size,

301
00:33:01,347 --> 00:33:06,452
and he was figurin' there might be a
way to slicker the guards out of position.

302
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:08,687
Of course, he wasn't
foolin' anybody really.

303
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,191
The steers were wise to him
and quick to match his move.

304
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:24,263
There'd be another chance.

305
00:34:24,296 --> 00:34:28,734
Put wolves and cattle together and sooner or later there will be a killin'.

306
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:32,538
When the buffalo were wiped out,

307
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:36,208
it left cattle as the wolves'
only hope for survival.

308
00:34:36,242 --> 00:34:39,711
So El feroz took what seemed
his rightful share,

309
00:34:39,745 --> 00:34:43,549
but the cattlemen
weren't sharin' with anybody.

310
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:45,751
And from the very beginning,
it was open warfare.

311
00:35:30,362 --> 00:35:33,199
Along about that point,
the cowboys got lucky.

312
00:35:33,232 --> 00:35:35,234
The mother was knocked down.

313
00:35:37,303 --> 00:35:40,339
She got right up and went on,

314
00:35:40,372 --> 00:35:43,375
but she wasn't in any shape
for a long grindin' chase now.

315
00:35:58,924 --> 00:36:02,428
El feroz lagged back
from time to time,

316
00:36:02,461 --> 00:36:05,631
encouragin' her,
hopin' she'd catch up.

317
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:09,468
But he had the young ones to think of, too,
and he had to go on.

318
00:36:12,438 --> 00:36:15,474
The female was gettin'
near the end of her rope.

319
00:36:19,778 --> 00:36:22,948
A wounded animal knows
when it's reached its limit.

320
00:36:22,981 --> 00:36:26,352
And typical-like, she went off
to find a resting place.

321
00:36:26,385 --> 00:36:29,588
Maybe the riders
would miss the turnoff...

322
00:36:29,621 --> 00:36:32,658
And give her
a much needed breathing spell.

323
00:36:34,893 --> 00:36:36,762
But that's not the way
it was to be.

333
00:39:06,878 --> 00:39:10,582
Never again would lobo
forget the smell of gunpowder.

334
00:39:10,616 --> 00:39:13,051
He got to know rifles by sight,

335
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:17,022
and he wouldn't let man nor horse come within a thousand yards of him.

336
00:39:21,427 --> 00:39:25,397
Yet all the time,
he and the family pack kept takin' more and more cattle.

337
00:39:37,776 --> 00:39:41,913
Before long,
the cattlemen's battle seemed to be a losin' one.

338
00:39:41,947 --> 00:39:44,716
The enemy was almost too smart.

339
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:48,520
Maybe it was a war
calling for more than guns.

340
00:39:53,559 --> 00:39:58,063
To catch a wolf in those days,
the cowman had to learn to think like one.

341
00:40:00,499 --> 00:40:04,135
The trick was to make him
outsmart himself.

342
00:40:04,169 --> 00:40:06,805
A wolf's an intelligent critter.

343
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:11,477
Fact is,
there's not many to match him when it comes to figurin' things out.

344
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:16,114
So if a trap was gonna fool him,
it had to be rigged up with some extra special trimmings.

345
00:40:19,818 --> 00:40:23,188
A little dogie was about
the most delectable come-on.

346
00:40:23,221 --> 00:40:28,426
There was something about young veal that was well-nigh irresistible.

347
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,669
Once the decoy was staked out,

348
00:40:37,703 --> 00:40:42,207
the next thing was to plant the trap where the wolf would have to pass.

349
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,043
The trap could be
most any standard make.

350
00:40:45,076 --> 00:40:49,815
It had to be strong though,
like, say, a well-made number 4.

351
00:40:49,848 --> 00:40:53,018
Not big as a bear trap maybe,
but big enough...

352
00:40:53,051 --> 00:40:56,221
And smooth workin'
with a fast action.

353
00:41:11,837 --> 00:41:14,640
Well, these preparations
had been pretty thorough.

354
00:41:14,673 --> 00:41:17,876
You might say they had
a touch of genius about 'em,

355
00:41:17,909 --> 00:41:21,547
'cause next morning it looked like nature herself was in on the deal,

356
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:24,182
playin' it on
the cattlemen's side.

357
00:41:28,954 --> 00:41:31,289
El feroz came on in the lead.

358
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,825
He was still headin' up
the family pack.

359
00:41:33,859 --> 00:41:37,128
And quick as a wink,
he spotted the calf.

360
00:41:40,799 --> 00:41:42,934
Naturally, he was tempted,
and why not?

361
00:41:42,968 --> 00:41:46,137
A free meal like this.

362
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:51,509
But before he made any move hasty-like,
he sniffed around a bit just checkin' on things.

363
00:42:14,733 --> 00:42:17,569
This all seemed
a little too good to be true.

364
00:42:17,603 --> 00:42:20,839
Might be that was
what was wrong with it.

365
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:26,144
Maybe he'd better back off
and size things up again.

366
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:34,285
Like an unexpected gunshot,
the trap sent the young wolves a-scatterin'.

367
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:37,923
They ducked out of sight
quick, all except lobo.

368
00:42:37,956 --> 00:42:42,127
He sensed something
wasn't right.

369
00:42:50,736 --> 00:42:55,707
There wasn't much he could do for El feroz
except lend him the comfort of his company.

370
00:42:55,741 --> 00:42:58,376
Still, there's a kind
of nobleness in the wolf.

371
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:01,980
In the unexplained way
of the breed, he stayed by,

372
00:43:02,013 --> 00:43:05,917
prepared to keep watch
to the end.

373
00:43:05,951 --> 00:43:09,054
Then the riders came back.

374
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:13,892
Lobo knew he'd have to leave.
He had no choice.

375
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:18,830
For all wild animals,
there comes the moment when they must go their own road.

376
00:43:18,864 --> 00:43:22,067
And for lobo
that moment was now.

377
00:43:24,135 --> 00:43:29,808
♪ The time had come for lobo

378
00:43:29,841 --> 00:43:35,080

♪ He must be wise or die

385
00:44:19,357 --> 00:44:23,328
by the next spring, lobo had
been a loner about long enough.

386
00:44:23,361 --> 00:44:26,197
It was time to start
lookin' for a mate,

387
00:44:26,231 --> 00:44:30,969
and his wanderings took him far from his old haunts into new territory.

388
00:44:34,873 --> 00:44:39,811
One fine morning he met up with some wolves he'd never seen before.

389
00:44:45,851 --> 00:44:49,354
He was of a mind to join 'em.

390
00:44:49,387 --> 00:44:53,725
According to pack law, he might
be accepted and he might not.

391
00:44:53,759 --> 00:44:57,295
It sort of depended
on whether they wanted him.

392
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:05,236
As it worked out,
they were kind of hankering for a new face too.

393
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:09,240
Right off,
lobo was made welcome.

394
00:45:11,943 --> 00:45:15,046
In the midst
of all the jubilation,

395
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,315
he caught sight of
a dark beauty on the sidelines,

396
00:45:17,348 --> 00:45:21,152
and he knew
his searching was over.

397
00:45:23,388 --> 00:45:27,325
The black female
seemed charmed with lobo too.

398
00:45:27,358 --> 00:45:31,262
Before long,
an old-fashioned courtship was underway.

399
00:45:39,037 --> 00:45:42,540
Takin' himself a mate wasn't gonna be quite this simple though.

400
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,509
There was a kind
of a catch to it.

401
00:45:44,542 --> 00:45:47,278
The one who really had the say
was the pack leader,

402
00:45:47,312 --> 00:45:51,082
surly old brute who right away
took a dislikin'...

403
00:45:51,116 --> 00:45:53,384
To the young fella
from out of the hills.

404
00:46:30,188 --> 00:46:32,991
The pack leader could see
he wasn't winnin'.

405
00:46:33,024 --> 00:46:36,862
And when you're not winnin',
you might as well do your losin' the easiest way possible.

406
00:46:39,564 --> 00:46:44,335
No sense gettin' yourself
killed just for show.

407
00:46:44,369 --> 00:46:49,975
He just tucked his tail between his legs and gave up,
simple as that.

408
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:59,417
And so the lobo legend
began to get a little bigger.

409
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:03,621
From that time on, lobo
ran at the head of the pack...

410
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:06,024
With his mate at his heels...

411
00:47:06,057 --> 00:47:10,595
And a following of the biggest,
strongest wolves in the vicinity.

412
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:25,276
When the mating season came on,
the pack split up for a while,

413
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:28,479
each pair of wolves
goin' off by itself.

414
00:47:28,513 --> 00:47:32,150
Some of 'em had dens
left over from last year.

415
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:35,120
But lobo and his mate,
bein' new at this,

416
00:47:35,153 --> 00:47:37,923
had to set up housekeeping
somewhere brand new.

417
00:47:43,661 --> 00:47:48,233
One day in their scouting,
they made a mighty interesting discovery.

418
00:47:48,266 --> 00:47:51,436
Across the canyon was
an old Indian cliff dwelling.

419
00:47:51,469 --> 00:47:54,639
Looked like it would
just about fill the bill.

420
00:47:54,672 --> 00:47:59,544
Only drawback was,
there didn't seem to be any way of gettin' over to it.

421
00:48:04,149 --> 00:48:07,685
Well, where there's a will,
there's generally a way.

422
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:12,690
And it turned out,
there was a sort of a crossing.

423
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:17,428
It was one of those
"as the crow flies" things,

424
00:48:17,462 --> 00:48:22,167
and a wolf wantin' to use it was gonna have
to be mighty eager to get on the other side.

425
00:48:25,536 --> 00:48:30,408
This didn't seem
to bother lobo though.

426
00:48:30,441 --> 00:48:35,080
After lookin' it over good,
he undertook to give it a try.

427
00:48:41,186 --> 00:48:45,423
The wolf's a surefooted critter with strong nerves and a steady eye,

428
00:48:45,456 --> 00:48:50,295
and lobo had all
the confidence of the breed.

429
00:49:06,411 --> 00:49:09,380
His mate, meanwhile, hung back.

430
00:49:09,414 --> 00:49:12,317
She wasn't near
so sure of herself.

431
00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:15,953
Bein' the female,
maybe she wasn't so foolhardy.

432
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:31,369
Finally, after lobo
had showed it could be done,

433
00:49:31,402 --> 00:49:35,373
she got up nerve enough
to follow him.

434
00:49:35,406 --> 00:49:38,443
Once underway, it wasn't so bad.

435
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:44,049
Fact is, in time,
these wolves would come to use this bridge practically every day.

436
00:49:44,082 --> 00:49:47,752
It came to be a part
of the lobo legend.

437
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:05,703
The cliff dwelling, when they
got to it, looked real inviting.

438
00:50:05,736 --> 00:50:09,407
The scent of man was long gone.

439
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:13,311
Besides, to these two,
it wasn't a house but a cave...

440
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:15,813
With all the proper
advantages of same.

441
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:20,785
Dry floor,
sheltering walls and a good roof against the rain.

442
00:50:20,818 --> 00:50:23,454
This was it, their new den.

443
00:50:26,091 --> 00:50:28,526
The both of 'em were
pleased with their find...

444
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:30,561
And, what's more important,
with each other.

445
00:50:32,197 --> 00:50:34,599
These two had mated for life,

446
00:50:34,632 --> 00:50:38,369
and right about now
the life ahead looked good.

447
00:50:45,143 --> 00:50:49,714
The next few weeks were pleasant ones,
and the days passed quickly.

448
00:50:49,747 --> 00:50:54,285
Then the time came when lobo's mate didn't hunt with him anymore.

449
00:50:56,487 --> 00:51:00,191
One morning when he got home from makin' his rounds,
he found out why.

450
00:51:10,168 --> 00:51:13,138
Sure was a handsome litter.

451
00:51:13,171 --> 00:51:16,107
Lobo was as proud
as a new daddy could be.

a thousand dollars,
a darn sight more than most human outlaws were worth.

471
00:52:33,518 --> 00:52:35,753
Lobo was a legend for sure,

472
00:52:35,786 --> 00:52:39,657
the most notorious name
in the whole southwest.

473
00:52:48,866 --> 00:52:54,605
One day a professional hunter from Texas rode into the territory,

474
00:52:54,639 --> 00:52:58,509
hopin' to take the famous wolf
that nobody else could catch.

475
00:53:00,445 --> 00:53:03,281
Bounty hunting
was his full-time trade,

476
00:53:03,314 --> 00:53:05,750
and he came equipped for it.

477
00:53:05,783 --> 00:53:09,887
He had a killer wolfhound so mean it had to be kept muzzled.

478
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,623
This was his hole card.

479
00:53:12,657 --> 00:53:15,493
But first, a wolf
had to be brought to bay.

480
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:20,465
And for this job,
he had a pack of the finest trackin' hounds ever gathered together.

481
00:53:26,804 --> 00:53:31,409
If anybody could bring in lobo,
looked like this was the man.

482
00:55:53,951 --> 00:55:58,389
It didn't take the hunter long
to see he'd been outsmarted.

483
00:55:58,423 --> 00:56:01,091
This lobo was a lot wiser
than he'd figured.

484
00:56:03,961 --> 00:56:06,931
The truth was, he had a kind
of a begrudging admiration...

485
00:56:06,964 --> 00:56:09,366
For a wolf that could think up
a strategy like this.

486
00:56:13,838 --> 00:56:18,443
Well, if the dogs couldn't bring this fella in,
there were other tricks to be tried.

487
00:56:20,511 --> 00:56:24,449
In lookin' over the situation,
he'd noticed somethin' important,

488
00:56:24,482 --> 00:56:29,687
a clue about lobo's habits that
just might prove his downfall.

489
00:56:41,065 --> 00:56:43,801
To anybody
who could read the signs,

490
00:56:43,834 --> 00:56:47,204
the giveaway was printed
on the ground beside the log.

491
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:51,876
The wolf tracks here
told their own story.

492
00:56:51,909 --> 00:56:54,645
It was plain as anything...

493
00:56:54,679 --> 00:56:57,915
The wolves always
came off the log at this spot.

494
00:56:57,948 --> 00:57:00,585
This was the place for a trap.

495
00:57:10,227 --> 00:57:13,898
The hunter took a lot of care
in settin' this one.

496
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:18,035
He picked an extra strong trap
with a hair-trigger action.

497
00:57:22,573 --> 00:57:26,176
Used a special trick to keep
the dirt from cloggin' it.

498
00:57:40,124 --> 00:57:43,060
Now it was
just a matter of time.

499
00:57:46,631 --> 00:57:50,801
It so happened lobo didn't
make his usual rounds that day.

500
00:57:50,835 --> 00:57:54,605
He'd stayed home with the family
sort of takin' things easy.

501
00:57:54,639 --> 00:57:58,075
His pups were about
three months old now,

502
00:57:58,108 --> 00:58:00,878
gettin' more active
every minute.

503
00:58:00,911 --> 00:58:03,814
One of 'em was lobo's
particular pride and joy,

504
00:58:03,848 --> 00:58:09,086
the dark little female who was
a dead ringer for her mother.

505
00:58:14,258 --> 00:58:19,697
With a family to raise,
lobo was apt to be watchin' his step pretty carefully.

506
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:23,033
The only thing was,
this time the man who was out to get him...

507
00:58:23,067 --> 00:58:25,536
Was the best in the business.

508
00:58:31,108 --> 00:58:34,679
When the hunter came back,
the trap was gone.

509
00:58:34,712 --> 00:58:37,648
Just as he figured,
lobo had come passin' by...

510
00:58:37,682 --> 00:58:41,218
And had stepped down
right where he thought he would.

511
00:58:41,251 --> 00:58:45,556
The fact that he wasn't in sight
was no cause for worry.

512
00:58:45,590 --> 00:58:50,060
He couldn't have got far 'cause the trap was chained to a heavy drag.

513
00:58:50,094 --> 00:58:55,099
It was leavin' a well-marked trail that would be no trouble at all to follow.

514
00:59:13,350 --> 00:59:17,822
It was a wolf, all right,
but the wrong one,

515
00:59:17,855 --> 00:59:22,092
lobo's mate,
not the old outlaw himself.

516
00:59:27,698 --> 00:59:30,300
Well, since exterminatin'
was his business,

517
00:59:30,334 --> 00:59:34,571
he might as well exterminate her
on general principles.

518
00:59:41,979 --> 00:59:44,715
Then a better idea hit him.

519
00:59:44,749 --> 00:59:49,119
If it was lobo he wanted,
maybe here was a golden opportunity.

520
00:59:51,856 --> 00:59:56,794
Taken alive, this female was
a sure way of gettin' at lobo.

521
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:04,769
When his mate didn't come home,
lobo began to get restless.

522
01:00:04,802 --> 01:00:07,772
He sensed somethin' was wrong.

523
01:00:07,805 --> 01:00:11,008
It wasn't like her to stay away
from her pups like this.

524
01:00:13,377 --> 01:00:18,115
He set out to find her, just as
the hunter reckoned he would.

525
01:00:36,867 --> 01:00:40,671
At the other end of the bridge,
lobo picked up the trail.

526
01:00:40,705 --> 01:00:44,241
His nose told him
his mate had been in trouble.

527
01:00:44,274 --> 01:00:48,378
Mixed with her scent was
another one, hated and bitter,

528
01:00:48,412 --> 01:00:51,281
a taint in the air
he wouldn't ever forget.
