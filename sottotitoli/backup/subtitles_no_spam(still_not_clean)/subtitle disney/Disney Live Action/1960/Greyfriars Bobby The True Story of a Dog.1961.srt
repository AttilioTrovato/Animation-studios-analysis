1
00:00:04,871 --> 00:00:09,050
This is the true story of a dog
who lived almost a century ago.

2
00:00:09,127 --> 00:00:13,346
His monument stands in Scotland's
capital city of Edinburgh to this day.

3
00:00:13,422 --> 00:00:16,491
Commemorating his devotion
to an old man whom he loved in life

4
00:00:16,568 --> 00:00:20,594
and guarded for 14 years
after death had parted them.

5
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:25,273
He made happier the lives of a whole
generation of children who knew him.

6
00:00:25,349 --> 00:00:27,458
This is his story.

7
00:02:50,312 --> 00:02:54,646
Jock, where's Bobby?
Will you listen to his barking?

8
00:02:54,722 --> 00:02:57,023
- Good morning to you, Master.
- Morning, Jock.

9
00:02:57,061 --> 00:02:59,708
Bobby's in the barn hunting rats, Elsie.

10
00:03:02,929 --> 00:03:04,884
Go and get him, Elsie,
and tale him into the house.

11
00:03:04,961 --> 00:03:07,454
He'll not come for anybody
but Old Jock, Father.

12
00:03:07,493 --> 00:03:09,563
Aye, he'll come for me.

13
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,057
Bobby!

14
00:03:16,658 --> 00:03:18,883
Down, Bobby.

15
00:03:20,647 --> 00:03:24,597
Aye, ye come to me as if ye belong to me.

16
00:03:24,636 --> 00:03:28,892
But he'll Now well he's yours, Elsie,
if you tale a wee bit of trouble with him.

17
00:03:28,968 --> 00:03:32,190
Ah, Bobby boy.
Shall I give you some breakfast, eh?

18
00:03:32,267 --> 00:03:34,913
Aye, do that, lassie.

19
00:03:37,022 --> 00:03:41,586
- Well, Jock, are you ready to go now?
- Aye. I have my things.

20
00:03:43,004 --> 00:03:46,380
It wasn't a bad year for the lambing,
Master. I can say that.

21
00:03:46,456 --> 00:03:47,568
No.

22
00:03:47,645 --> 00:03:50,752
And young Master Wattie
has learned the way of it now.

23
00:03:50,828 --> 00:03:53,934
Aye, you taught him well enough.

24
00:03:53,973 --> 00:03:57,080
Elsie, tale Bobby into the house, will ye?
Jock and me are away to Edinburgh.

25
00:03:57,156 --> 00:03:59,073
To the market.

26
00:04:01,106 --> 00:04:04,059
Whist, laddie!
You're not coming this time.

27
00:04:04,136 --> 00:04:06,973
Go with your mistress and hold your noise.

28
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,239
Get up there.
Wattie! Open up the gate, will ye?

29
00:04:21,316 --> 00:04:23,234
Come on, boy. Up.

30
00:04:34,202 --> 00:04:36,120
Come on, boy. Up.

31
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,931
Elsie, put him in Jock’s old seat
in the corner.

32
00:04:48,007 --> 00:04:51,766
Maybe he'll sleep quiet there
and stop his grieving.

33
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:59,091
Mother? Why did Old Jock no' tale Bobby
to the market with him?

34
00:05:02,274 --> 00:05:04,767
Give him a bowl of broth.
Keep him quiet.

35
00:05:09,599 --> 00:05:12,897
Is Bobby really my own dog now,
to do what I like with?

36
00:05:12,973 --> 00:05:16,119
- Aye. He's yours.
- And Old Jock will not mind it?

37
00:05:18,726 --> 00:05:21,333
Bobby! Come back!

38
00:05:21,372 --> 00:05:24,632
Bobby, where are you going?
Bobby, come back!

39
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:27,316
Bobby, Bobby! Come back!

40
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:30,998
Bobby, Bobby! Wattie, stop him!

41
00:05:31,075 --> 00:05:33,299
Stop him, Wattie!

42
00:05:34,603 --> 00:05:38,706
Bobby, come back. Bobby!
You naughty dog! Come back!

43
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:59,031
Jock, I'm no' happy about you
going from Cauldbrae. You Now that.

44
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:02,598
Aye. I'm not happy myself, Master.

45
00:06:02,675 --> 00:06:06,548
Well... well, times are very hard, Jock.
I just can nae afford ye, that's all.

46
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,888
I'm no' blaming' ye, Master.

47
00:06:08,965 --> 00:06:12,070
I've been a shepherd now for 60 years.

48
00:06:12,109 --> 00:06:14,602
It willna be so hard to find another place.

49
00:06:14,679 --> 00:06:18,091
I did nae tell the bairns
you would nae be coming home with me.

50
00:06:18,168 --> 00:06:20,815
- I could nae tell them.
- No.

51
00:06:22,579 --> 00:06:24,764
It would serve no purpose.

52
00:06:25,876 --> 00:06:27,794
Get up, boy.

53
00:06:51,072 --> 00:06:52,990
Hello there!

54
00:07:01,082 --> 00:07:03,881
Steady, boy.

55
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,914
I'm a minute slow by gun time.

56
00:07:05,991 --> 00:07:08,215
How do you foll here
ever get used to the crack of it?

57
00:07:08,253 --> 00:07:09,864
My head nearly jumped off my neck.

58
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:12,165
I'd like to pay you for two weeks, Jock.

59
00:07:12,242 --> 00:07:15,233
I'll not tale a shilling I haven't earned.

60
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,227
Well, if you want.

61
00:07:20,104 --> 00:07:23,363
There's no more to be said. Thank you.

62
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,933
- I'll be going' on my way.
- Aye.

63
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:28,809
Goodbye then, Jock.

64
00:07:30,112 --> 00:07:32,031
Good luck to you.

65
00:07:51,359 --> 00:07:53,199
Get up.

66
00:07:55,385 --> 00:07:57,763
Come on, you silly boy.

67
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:35,499
You little imp!
Go on, get down there. Get down!

68
00:08:35,576 --> 00:08:37,916
Get out of here!

69
00:08:50,686 --> 00:08:52,872
You dinna have to glare at me, Mr. Traill.

70
00:08:52,948 --> 00:08:57,052
Glare at the dog, jumpin' on my lap
and howling like a banshee.

71
00:08:57,129 --> 00:09:01,040
You're in his master's usual place
for dinner on market day.

72
00:09:01,078 --> 00:09:05,949
What's wrong, Bobby? You're usually here
bang on time with the 1:00 gun.

73
00:09:06,026 --> 00:09:09,708
And you're all muddy and panting, laddie.
Where's Old Jock?

74
00:09:09,746 --> 00:09:12,775
No, Old Jock’s not here, Bobby.

75
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:15,384
Go find him.

76
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:19,371
I'd tale my hand to the wee dog
for dirtying me like that.

77
00:09:21,788 --> 00:09:24,971
If I put my hand to everyone
that dirties up the place,

78
00:09:25,009 --> 00:09:27,885
I'd have my work cut out, I'm thinning'.

79
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:33,676
Have you seen, any of you, the old
shepherd body from Cauldbrae, Old Jock,

80
00:09:33,714 --> 00:09:37,741
- in the market today?
- Aye, just after time gun,

81
00:09:37,818 --> 00:09:39,812
but I have nae seen him since.

82
00:09:39,888 --> 00:09:43,609
It's the first time in years
he hasna come to me for his dinner.

83
00:09:43,686 --> 00:09:45,219
Yet his wee dog was here.

84
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:49,630
Give it back!

85
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,391
Get away!

86
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:55,497
Ach! Gang away home!

87
00:10:26,676 --> 00:10:29,092
Bobby!

88
00:10:29,168 --> 00:10:31,584
How did you get here?

89
00:10:31,661 --> 00:10:34,154
You shouldna be with me.

90
00:10:34,231 --> 00:10:37,260
You should be home.

91
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:40,980
You should be home at Cauldbrae, laddie.

92
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:44,470
You'll have the wee Elsie grieving' for you.

93
00:10:53,598 --> 00:10:57,547
Have a wee drink.
Come on. At least have a drink.

94
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,749
That sounds like Bobby.

95
00:11:19,867 --> 00:11:22,091
Aye, I'm coming.

96
00:11:22,168 --> 00:11:25,351
I'm not staying in the lirlyard yet.

97
00:11:25,428 --> 00:11:27,882
Just give me a chance to get my breath.

98
00:11:30,374 --> 00:11:33,788
You're as great a scold
as the wife I never had.

99
00:11:35,207 --> 00:11:38,237
Is that you, Bobby?

100
00:11:38,774 --> 00:11:41,305
Here. What is it, Bobby? Did you find...

101
00:11:43,222 --> 00:11:45,830
So you found him.
All right, laddie, I'm coming.

102
00:11:51,276 --> 00:11:54,152
Jock! Jock, man, what ails ye?

103
00:11:54,228 --> 00:11:57,565
Man, you're sick.
And you're wet through. Here.

104
00:11:57,642 --> 00:12:00,480
Come on. Come over to my place.
Give me your arm.

105
00:12:02,857 --> 00:12:07,574
Come on, Jock. Tale off your coat
and plaid, and sit down here by the fire.

106
00:12:07,613 --> 00:12:09,568
Here. Give me the bag.

107
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:10,949
Here.

108
00:12:11,026 --> 00:12:13,403
Aye, I'm wet.

109
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,934
- It's a misty night.
- Misty?

110
00:12:16,011 --> 00:12:19,309
It's raining like a torrent.
And you call it misty!

111
00:12:19,386 --> 00:12:22,070
I'm telling' ye,
if Noah himself had been a Lowland Scot,

112
00:12:22,147 --> 00:12:25,522
he'd have said the Deluge
flooding the world was just...

113
00:12:25,599 --> 00:12:27,478
just fair wet.

114
00:12:27,516 --> 00:12:30,930
And wasna the Deluge fair wet, Mr. Traill?

115
00:12:32,157 --> 00:12:34,611
- Have you had your supper yet, man?
- No, no' yet.

116
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:37,027
But don't bother yourself, Mr. Traill.

117
00:12:37,104 --> 00:12:40,747
I'm bothered as it is,
so dinna male it worse by arguing.

118
00:12:40,785 --> 00:12:44,582
And you, Bobby, stop that. I'm no'
in need of a shower in the house, thanl ye.

119
00:12:44,659 --> 00:12:46,729
Nor yet a pattern of dirty feet.

120
00:12:48,071 --> 00:12:50,373
Aye, he's tallin' to you.

121
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:52,482
Here now, eat.

122
00:12:58,158 --> 00:13:01,571
You were always
a hospitable man, Mr. Traill.

123
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:05,636
And pray, how many market days
have you spent your sixpence eating here?

124
00:13:05,713 --> 00:13:08,703
I'm thinking of nothing more than to warm
you up, so you'll be coming here again.

125
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,967
Now, din nae thanl me for that.

126
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:14,494
You're fortunate that
that's a very intelligent wee dog you have.

127
00:13:14,571 --> 00:13:16,949
He was here at the time gun
searching for you.

128
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,244
Man, you're ill.

129
00:13:23,661 --> 00:13:25,578
You're very ill.

130
00:13:25,655 --> 00:13:28,531
Now, you stay here and eat your food.
I'll go and get a doctor for ye.

131
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:33,861
- No! I'll not see a doctor.
- Man, you're in need of a dose of physic

132
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:36,316
and a bed in the infirmary for a day
or two, until you're right again.

133
00:13:36,355 --> 00:13:38,233
No!

134
00:13:38,272 --> 00:13:41,724
The infirmary's for poor people
that are dying.

135
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,986
No man leaves the infirmary alive.

136
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:46,747
Jock, that's no' true.

137
00:13:46,823 --> 00:13:49,240
I go there myself
if I so much as cut my finger.

138
00:13:49,317 --> 00:13:51,464
Let any student laddie bind it up for me.

139
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:54,301
That only proves you're soft.
But not me!

140
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:57,370
All right, all right.
Now, calm yourself.

141
00:13:58,597 --> 00:14:01,589
Nobody's gonna male you do
what you don't wish.

142
00:14:02,586 --> 00:14:05,232
Now, eat your broth.

143
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:08,338
Bobby. Bobby, come here.

144
00:14:08,377 --> 00:14:10,562
Bobby! Where are ye?

145
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,515
Och! He's over at my library
in the corner there.

146
00:14:13,592 --> 00:14:17,810
- Is he so smart he likes to read?
- No, he can't read, Mr. Traill.

147
00:14:18,309 --> 00:14:20,264
I can't read myself.

148
00:14:20,342 --> 00:14:23,601
That's a lot of books
you've got there, Mr. Traill.

149
00:14:23,678 --> 00:14:25,979
You must be a very serious man.

150
00:14:26,055 --> 00:14:29,546
Aye. I am that.
And books are wife and bairns to me

151
00:14:29,622 --> 00:14:32,997
and as good company
as that wee beast is to yourself.

152
00:14:33,073 --> 00:14:37,637
Here, Bobby. I'm thinning' you've not had
very much to eat today yourself, laddie.

153
00:14:37,714 --> 00:14:40,054
Here. There.

154
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:44,578
He's a good wee beast, this Bobby of
yours. You must be very proud of him.

155
00:14:44,655 --> 00:14:48,529
Aye, but he's not my own dog.
He's not mine at all.

156
00:14:48,606 --> 00:14:52,210
Man, he's fair fond of you.
And a dog chooses his own master.

157
00:14:52,287 --> 00:14:55,854
Aye, but he can't choose.
He's got to go home.

158
00:14:56,429 --> 00:15:00,494
I can't say that it won't be sad parting,
but he's got to go.

159
00:15:00,571 --> 00:15:04,444
I must get word to Cauldbrae,

160
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:08,701
so they can come and tale him home.

161
00:15:10,311 --> 00:15:13,456
Bobby, now you lie still there
and mind Old Jock.

162
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:16,371
I have to fetch the doctor to him.

163
00:15:16,447 --> 00:15:19,554
I'm all right. I'm quite well.

164
00:15:20,321 --> 00:15:23,580
Don't let a doctor see me.

165
00:15:23,619 --> 00:15:27,032
You're very sick, Jock.
It's the only thing.

166
00:15:27,646 --> 00:15:29,563
Now, you stay here.

167
00:15:38,652 --> 00:15:42,334
They'll not tale me to their infirmary.

168
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:44,404
Come on, Bobby.

169
00:16:26,091 --> 00:16:30,155
What am I to do with you, laddie?

170
00:16:30,233 --> 00:16:33,339
I can get a lodging in here,

171
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:36,714
but the old woman that runs it
will not tale a dog.

172
00:16:37,366 --> 00:16:39,743
What's that you're saying?

173
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:43,809
Aye, you're a canny wee dog.
You're right.

174
00:16:43,886 --> 00:16:48,103
I've carried newborn lambs in the pocket
of my plaid, so why not you, eh?

175
00:16:48,142 --> 00:16:51,057
Very well. In you go, laddie.

176
00:17:10,347 --> 00:17:12,993
I want a bed for the night
if you have one free.

177
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:16,445
- Free, is it?
- No, no, I didn't mean it that way.

178
00:17:16,521 --> 00:17:19,167
- Ahh.
- I've been here before, you Now.

179
00:17:19,244 --> 00:17:22,351
So you have, so you have.

180
00:17:22,427 --> 00:17:26,645
I mind you.
You're the one they call Old Jock.

181
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:29,752
Here's the money for my bed.

182
00:17:31,171 --> 00:17:33,203
And the farthing for the light.

183
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,390
All right.

184
00:17:38,419 --> 00:17:41,563
Has the front room at the very top
of the stairs got anybody in it?

185
00:17:41,641 --> 00:17:43,903
No, no. Nobody there.

186
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:47,277
That cough you have.

187
00:17:47,354 --> 00:17:51,189
If you waken your neighbors with it,
you'll need to fight it out for yourself.

188
00:17:51,266 --> 00:17:53,758
I Now all about that.

189
00:18:49,635 --> 00:18:54,007
Wait now, laddie.
Ye may well smell rats in here, but...

190
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:56,307
whisht!

191
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:02,482
We're above the old city smell up here.

192
00:19:03,249 --> 00:19:06,202
It was worth the climb, eh, Bobby?

193
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:09,615
I left a wee something here
a few months back.

194
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:13,757
Aye! It's here yet.

195
00:19:14,831 --> 00:19:17,591
A posy of heather, laddie.

196
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:19,548
And not dead.

197
00:19:20,852 --> 00:19:23,727
You can almost smell the moors in it.

198
00:19:24,648 --> 00:19:27,218
Can you not?

199
00:19:28,905 --> 00:19:32,318
What do you say, Bobby?
Will we pretend we're out there now?

200
00:19:35,233 --> 00:19:38,032
Come on, then.
Beg for your supper.

201
00:19:38,108 --> 00:19:40,372
That's it. Good laddie.

202
00:19:40,448 --> 00:19:42,404
Ho. Down now, down.

203
00:19:44,321 --> 00:19:46,124
Up, boy.

204
00:19:46,201 --> 00:19:47,811
Good, good.

205
00:19:47,888 --> 00:19:50,956
Die for your country.
Die for your country now.

206
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:54,101
Ah, that's a good laddie.

207
00:19:58,205 --> 00:20:00,429
Hoo! Jump!

208
00:20:03,688 --> 00:20:06,986
Loup! Loup!

209
00:20:07,945 --> 00:20:10,207
Who's that dog in there?

210
00:20:10,284 --> 00:20:13,736
Who's making' all that noise?

211
00:20:14,925 --> 00:20:16,803
Shh, laddie.

212
00:20:16,842 --> 00:20:18,568
What's all the noise about?

213
00:20:18,645 --> 00:20:19,872
Shh.

214
00:20:19,949 --> 00:20:22,671
I thought I heard a dog myself!

215
00:20:22,748 --> 00:20:25,049
Quiet, laddie, or they'll throw you out.

216
00:20:29,536 --> 00:20:33,141
In the devil's name, hold your row,
or I'll fetch the constable to you!

217
00:20:33,218 --> 00:20:35,978
I'll no' have you fighting' in my house.
Hold your row!

218
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:48,289
You see what an old fool Old Jock is?

219
00:20:49,593 --> 00:20:53,198
I have a Bible for my comfort,
and I cannot read.

220
00:20:54,463 --> 00:20:58,260
My father gave it to me
when he lay dying' in his croft.

221
00:20:59,487 --> 00:21:02,478
It's the only thing I've got.

222
00:21:02,555 --> 00:21:04,473
A book I cannot read.

223
00:21:04,511 --> 00:21:08,499
And a fool dog that's not my own.

224
00:21:09,689 --> 00:21:12,028
I must get to sleep now.

225
00:21:13,753 --> 00:21:16,170
And you too, laddie.

226
00:21:16,822 --> 00:21:19,276
Lie quiet now.

227
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:42,478
- Good day, Mr. Traill.
- Good day to you.

228
00:21:42,516 --> 00:21:44,970
Did any of you find anything out
about that old shepherd yet?

229
00:21:45,047 --> 00:21:48,230
He has nae been found and taken
to the infirmary or to the lockup.

230
00:21:48,306 --> 00:21:50,723
- I Now for certain.
- Well, I din nae understand it.

231
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,174
He can nae have gone far,
and I'm fair worried about him.

232
00:21:54,251 --> 00:21:57,741
But I tell ye, if ye see a wee bit
of a Skye terrier running loose,

233
00:21:57,818 --> 00:22:00,003
the old man will no' be far away,
so sleep your eyes open.

234
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:02,803
- Ach, I've got better things to do.
- Aye, and so have I!

235
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,408
And I pay my taxes where your wages
come from, so mind your manners!

236
00:22:06,484 --> 00:22:09,093
- Ach, ye si...
- Morning, Mr. Traill.

237
00:22:09,169 --> 00:22:12,007
Good morning, laddie.
Here, just a minute.

238
00:22:12,045 --> 00:22:14,654
If you see a wee Skye terrier,
a wee gray dog,

239
00:22:14,692 --> 00:22:15,996
anywhere near Cowgate or the market,

240
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:18,335
come and tell me,
and I'll give ye both a penny.

241
00:22:18,373 --> 00:22:21,633
- A penny? A whole penny?
- Each?

242
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:25,851
Aye. But off you go. Away with you.
See what you can find.

243
00:22:42,649 --> 00:22:45,064
Here, how many more is there up there?

244
00:22:46,906 --> 00:22:49,820
Is there one of you still
skulking up there?

245
00:22:49,897 --> 00:22:53,962
Dinna forget I can charge ye the whole day
if you're still there at the time gun!

246
00:22:59,637 --> 00:23:01,095
Do you no' hear me?

247
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:10,184
Are you in there?

248
00:23:11,372 --> 00:23:12,293
Old Jock?

249
00:23:13,904 --> 00:23:15,783
Old Jock!

250
00:23:17,202 --> 00:23:19,311
Can you no' hear me?

251
00:23:19,388 --> 00:23:21,497
Were ye that sick?

252
00:23:36,683 --> 00:23:40,250
Hey, some of ye down there! Any of ye!
Go and get the police.

253
00:23:40,327 --> 00:23:43,778
Run, will ye? Run! Go on, run!

254
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:03,528
He died of pneumonia,
and of being old and just plain worn-out.

255
00:24:03,605 --> 00:24:06,328
You see?
The old man dies a natural death.

256
00:24:06,367 --> 00:24:08,552
Nobody's harmed him.
He's not even been robbed.

257
00:24:08,629 --> 00:24:11,506
- Hold your noise, woman.
- Ahh.

258
00:24:11,966 --> 00:24:16,337
It's something strange to find a decent
old country body in a foul place like this.

259
00:24:16,414 --> 00:24:18,485
This is a clean, respectable house.

260
00:24:18,562 --> 00:24:22,856
- Who was he?
- Old Jock. He'd no name but that.

261
00:24:22,933 --> 00:24:25,848
His name was John Gray.

262
00:24:25,925 --> 00:24:28,264
Well, there's enough here
to give him a decent burial.

263
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:30,488
He'll no' have a pauper's grave.

264
00:24:30,526 --> 00:24:34,285
Right. I'll see to it. There's no' enough
to hire a carriage, or even a cart,

265
00:24:34,362 --> 00:24:36,432
so he'll have to rest in
the lirlyard that is nearest.

266
00:24:36,471 --> 00:24:40,728
Now clear out this room, all of you.
Not you, Campbell.

267
00:24:40,766 --> 00:24:43,028
What's that dog doin' here?

268
00:24:44,295 --> 00:24:47,171
Whose dog is it? The old man's?

269
00:24:47,247 --> 00:24:50,546
- No, no. He did nae have any dog.
- Aye, he did so.

270
00:24:50,623 --> 00:24:52,655
- Ach...
- I heard the dog barking' in the night.

271
00:24:52,731 --> 00:24:55,799
Aye, that's true.
There was a dog barking.

272
00:24:55,876 --> 00:24:58,369
Then it's my duty to tale him
to the police station.

273
00:24:58,446 --> 00:25:02,664
He's got no collar,
and for all I Now, no license.

274
00:25:02,702 --> 00:25:04,620
Come here now, my laddie.

275
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,329
"'I am the resurrection and the life'
saith the Lord."

276
00:26:44,406 --> 00:26:49,123
"'He that believeth in me,
though he were dead, yet shall he live."'

277
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,188
"'Whosoever liveth and believeth in me
shall never die."'

278
00:26:53,265 --> 00:26:55,911
"We therefore commit his body
to the ground."

279
00:26:55,950 --> 00:27:00,514
"Earth to earth, ashes to ashes,
dust to dust."

280
00:27:00,974 --> 00:27:03,850
"Which thy well-beloved son
shall then pronounce"

281
00:27:03,888 --> 00:27:05,997
on all that love and fear thee, saying:

282
00:27:06,073 --> 00:27:07,953
'Come, ye blessed of my father,

283
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:11,519
inherit the kingdom prepared for you
from the foundation of the world."'

284
00:27:11,596 --> 00:27:13,898
"Grant this, we beseech thee,
O merciful Fa..."

285
00:27:16,505 --> 00:27:20,072
"Through Jesus Christ,
our mediator and redeemer. Amen."

286
00:27:20,149 --> 00:27:22,143
Amen.

287
00:27:28,049 --> 00:27:29,352
- Good night to ye both.
- Good night.

288
00:27:30,541 --> 00:27:32,459
It's past time for locking' up.

289
00:27:41,011 --> 00:27:44,692
What are you doin' there?
Be off wi' you! Away home.

290
00:27:44,769 --> 00:27:46,188
Away!

291
00:27:46,265 --> 00:27:48,489
A lirlyard's no place for a dog.

292
00:27:55,085 --> 00:27:58,153
There now. Away wi' you.
Away home. Out of here!

293
00:27:58,805 --> 00:28:00,109
Dogs in the lirlyard.

294
00:28:00,186 --> 00:28:02,870
Go on! Away wi' you!

295
00:28:49,388 --> 00:28:51,268
Ailie! Ailie!

296
00:28:52,073 --> 00:28:55,179
- What is it?
- There's the dog Mr. Traill's looking for.

297
00:28:55,256 --> 00:28:56,291
- Where?
- There!

298
00:28:58,171 --> 00:29:00,740
Come on and catch him,
and we'll get a penny.

299
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:20,413
There he is, Ailie. Run!
Dinna lose him now, Ailie. Run!

300
00:29:23,329 --> 00:29:25,169
- Thanl you.
- Hope you enjoyed it.

301
00:29:25,246 --> 00:29:27,930
- Aye.
- Thanl you.

302
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,916
- What do you think you're doing?
- Och, out of my way.

303
00:29:32,992 --> 00:29:34,526
Mr. Traill.

304
00:29:34,603 --> 00:29:36,444
Mr. Traill, we found the wee dog.

305
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:40,700
Where have ye been, Bobby?
Did the time gun bring you for your dinner?

306
00:29:40,739 --> 00:29:43,309
Where's Old Jock, laddie?

307
00:29:43,386 --> 00:29:44,958
What have ye done wi' him?

308
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:53,203
Whisht, Bobby, whisht.

309
00:29:53,241 --> 00:29:56,885
What is it then? Is it Old Jock?
Well, where is he?

310
00:29:56,923 --> 00:29:58,955
Oh, Mr. Traill, do we no' get the penny?

311
00:29:59,032 --> 00:30:00,987
Later, child, later.
Dinna bother me now.

312
00:30:01,064 --> 00:30:02,982
What's a dog doin' in here, anyway?

313
00:30:03,059 --> 00:30:05,206
Throw him out.
He's shaking' with a sickness.

314
00:30:05,283 --> 00:30:08,773
No, man, he's hungry,
and an old customer.

315
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:10,844
Which is more than ye are yourself.

316
00:30:10,921 --> 00:30:13,221
Out you go.
Come on, now. Get out.

317
00:30:13,336 --> 00:30:15,561
Here, Bobby. Come on, now.

318
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:17,325
What about eating, eh?

319
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:22,426
- Did you get the penny, Ailie?
- No. No penny.

320
00:30:24,036 --> 00:30:27,756
I wish I Knew where ye came from,
Bobby, and where ye left your master.

321
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:40,258
Now then, Bobby,

322
00:30:40,334 --> 00:30:44,131
be a good dog,
and let's go and find Old Jock, eh, laddie?

323
00:30:45,857 --> 00:30:47,775
Here, Bobby! Wait! Here!

324
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:57,324
You want to lead me
through the old lirlyard, laddie?

325
00:30:58,436 --> 00:30:59,893
Wait.

326
00:30:59,969 --> 00:31:02,961
The gate's no' locked yet.
It's only latched.

327
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,758
Who's that at the gate?

328
00:31:13,546 --> 00:31:17,764
Mr. Traill. What in the world are you
doing prowling about the lirlyard?

329
00:31:17,841 --> 00:31:19,797
It's time for locking' up.

330
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:22,673
- I followed a wee dog here, Mr. Brown.
- Dog?

331
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:25,626
There's no dog here.
It isna permitted.

332
00:31:26,585 --> 00:31:28,387
I just let him in myself.

333
00:31:28,464 --> 00:31:30,803
- You let a dog in the lirlyard?
- Aye.

334
00:31:30,841 --> 00:31:33,296
Then I'll have the law on ye!

335
00:31:33,335 --> 00:31:35,520
You're supposed to be
such a learned man.

336
00:31:35,597 --> 00:31:38,051
Can you no' read the regulations?

337
00:31:38,128 --> 00:31:42,193
Those regulations are no' the law of the
land, James Brown, and well ye Now it.

338
00:31:42,232 --> 00:31:44,302
You made up those rules yourself.

339
00:31:44,379 --> 00:31:47,486
I'll have no dog in Greyfriars Schoolyard.

340
00:31:47,562 --> 00:31:51,435
- You Now that! Yours or anybody else's!
- The dog isna mine.

341
00:31:52,625 --> 00:31:54,542
But I'll male a bargain wi' ye.

342
00:31:54,619 --> 00:31:56,881
I'll tale him home wi' me,

343
00:31:56,958 --> 00:32:00,141
and you can sleep your regulations.

344
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:02,480
Uh-huh. And I will, too.

345
00:32:02,557 --> 00:32:06,086
I caught and put out one dog last night,
and he's no' been back.

346
00:32:06,162 --> 00:32:08,425
And I'll catch this one, too, mind ye.

347
00:32:08,501 --> 00:32:10,380
Come on.

348
00:32:10,418 --> 00:32:13,640
Now then, you go that
way, and I'll go here.

349
00:32:13,717 --> 00:32:15,442
Here, dog. Here.

350
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,666
Where are ye? Dog!

351
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:22,154
Here, dog. Here. Here now.

352
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:24,071
Bobby.

353
00:32:25,644 --> 00:32:27,715
Ailie!

354
00:32:27,791 --> 00:32:29,900
- Who's there?
- Whisht!

355
00:32:29,977 --> 00:32:31,473
Mr. Traill, it's you.

356
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:34,579
- The wee dog that was at my place.
- Aye.

357
00:32:34,656 --> 00:32:37,493
And Tammy and me chased him there,
and you didn't give us our penny.

358
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:40,293
Whisht, Ailie!
Now listen to me a minute.

359
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:44,397
- For a penny I'll listen.
- For a silver shilling, listen.

360
00:32:44,474 --> 00:32:48,922
- A shilling?
- If you see the wee dog again...

361
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,604
and he's no' far away, I'm thinning' -
call him "Bobby" and fetch him to me.

362
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,559
- You or any of you bairns.
- Aye.

363
00:32:54,598 --> 00:32:58,088
And the one that brings him
will get a silver shilling.

364
00:32:58,165 --> 00:33:00,772
Have ye taken leave of your senses?

365
00:33:00,849 --> 00:33:04,339
I'll have every bairn in the neighborhood
climbing all over my lirlyard.

366
00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:06,601
And half of them
are like wild beasties as it is.

367
00:33:06,678 --> 00:33:09,784
- No' with me, they're not.
- No, because you're soft wi' 'em.

368
00:33:09,861 --> 00:33:13,082
I'm no' soft wi' any living thing.

369
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:14,846
A bairn's like a dog in many ways.

370
00:33:14,923 --> 00:33:17,953
You tale a stick to one or the other
and he'll misbehave the worse.

371
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:22,209
The bairns around here are poor
and neglected. But they're no' vicious.

372
00:33:22,286 --> 00:33:25,776
You get on the right side of them, man,
and you'll live easier.

373
00:33:28,384 --> 00:33:31,376
Wait a minute.
You say there was a dog here yesterday?

374
00:33:31,414 --> 00:33:35,555
Aye, wi' a funeral,
and creeping about here afterwards.

375
00:33:35,632 --> 00:33:38,739
- Whose funeral?
- An old man named John Gray.

376
00:33:38,815 --> 00:33:41,921
Dead of pneumonia
in a lodging house at Cowgate.

377
00:33:41,998 --> 00:33:45,220
Pneumonia? Aye, that'd be it.

378
00:33:45,296 --> 00:33:48,977
Aye, and carried here by such a bunch
of gaolbirds as you never did see.

379
00:33:49,055 --> 00:33:50,896
And no mourners.

380
00:33:50,972 --> 00:33:53,963
John Gray, you say his name was.

381
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,035
I Knew him as Old Jock.

382
00:33:56,111 --> 00:34:00,483
And if the wee dog was with him,
he had a mourner, all right.

383
00:34:01,863 --> 00:34:03,973
Poor old man.
I drove him to his death.

384
00:34:04,011 --> 00:34:07,117
- What are ye saying, man?
- He came to me sick.

385
00:34:07,194 --> 00:34:10,109
I told him he should be in the infirmary
and went for a doctor to male him go.

386
00:34:10,186 --> 00:34:13,637
But he went away.
An old sick man in the rain.

387
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:16,974
- Where's he buried?
- Over here.

388
00:34:22,074 --> 00:34:24,950
That's where they laid him down.

389
00:34:29,476 --> 00:34:31,240
What's that?

390
00:34:31,316 --> 00:34:33,502
- Here now. Come! Come!
- Bobby.

391
00:34:33,579 --> 00:34:35,880
Here, laddie. Come here.

392
00:34:35,957 --> 00:34:37,836
Ahh. There.

393
00:34:37,912 --> 00:34:41,748
Come out now. I'll fi...

394
00:34:41,824 --> 00:34:43,933
Ah, you have him, huh?

395
00:34:47,654 --> 00:34:49,418
That's the dog I put out before.

396
00:34:49,494 --> 00:34:52,945
Aye. The old man was his master.

397
00:34:53,022 --> 00:34:56,704
Be that as it may,
the dog's no' staying in my lirlyard.

398
00:34:56,781 --> 00:34:59,503
And might I remind you
it's past time for lockin' up?

399
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,114
Can he no' bide here till he's claimed?

400
00:35:01,191 --> 00:35:04,029
No, he cannot.
It's against the regulations.

401
00:35:04,105 --> 00:35:08,823
Then you put him out.
You and your regulations.

402
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:11,737
For I can nae.

403
00:35:11,813 --> 00:35:14,000
Good night to ye, Mr. Brown.

404
00:35:27,729 --> 00:35:29,646
There. Now he's out.

405
00:35:34,555 --> 00:35:37,700
And good night and good riddance
to the pair of ye.

406
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,515
Jamie, what on earth were ye doin'
out there in the dark, man?

407
00:35:48,553 --> 00:35:50,585
- Administering the law.
- Oh.

408
00:35:50,662 --> 00:35:54,191
And what James Brown says
in Greyfriars Schoolyard is the law.

409
00:35:54,842 --> 00:35:58,217
Now what are we gonna do, laddie?
Ye can nae get in there now. It's locked.

410
00:35:58,293 --> 00:36:01,093
You might as well face up to the fact.
You can nae get in.

411
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:04,813
Why don't you come home with me,
laddie? I'm not a bad man to live with.

412
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:06,156
Will you no' come?

413
00:36:14,899 --> 00:36:17,200
What's all the disturbance about?

414
00:36:17,277 --> 00:36:19,578
- Quiet! Quiet!
- Whisht, Bobby, whisht!

415
00:36:19,617 --> 00:36:22,723
Mr. Traill, have ye taken to a dog
at your time of life?

416
00:36:22,799 --> 00:36:26,558
- I would if he'd only tale to me.
- Then sleep him in order.

417
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:32,962
How do ye expect my, uh, customers to
read enough to satisfy their examiners...

418
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:35,608
- if they're disturbed by all this barking?
- Whisht.

419
00:36:35,685 --> 00:36:39,290
You'll stop that dog's noise
or I'll send for the police.

420
00:36:39,367 --> 00:36:42,204
Geordie Ross!

421
00:36:42,281 --> 00:36:46,500
- Yes, Mr. Traill?
- Geordie, I have a problem.

422
00:36:46,576 --> 00:36:48,570
Would you like to earn a sixpence?

423
00:36:48,647 --> 00:36:52,406
- A sixpence? Aye, I would.
- Then it's yours...

424
00:36:52,444 --> 00:36:55,397
if ye Now a way to smuggle this wee dog
into the lirlyard yonder.

425
00:36:55,473 --> 00:36:59,999
- And never mind why.
- Well, there might be a way.

426
00:37:00,076 --> 00:37:02,836
- And you're the man who Knows how.
- Aye.

427
00:37:03,565 --> 00:37:05,483
Give me the sixpence.

428
00:37:08,742 --> 00:37:10,084
Aye.

429
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:12,578
Ye like me now
you're gettin' your way, don't ye?

430
00:37:12,654 --> 00:37:14,265
Here.

431
00:37:14,342 --> 00:37:19,557
And Geordie, if ye say a word about this
to anyone, I'll give you a good licking'.

432
00:37:19,634 --> 00:37:23,853
Och, I willna tell, Mr. Traill.
I'll be very discreet.

433
00:37:49,931 --> 00:37:53,382
- And that's the whole story.
- There.

434
00:37:53,458 --> 00:37:56,143
Nae dog will be permitted
in Greyfriars Schoolyard

435
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,792
as long as I'm caretaker here.

436
00:38:19,613 --> 00:38:22,451
Well, good afternoon, mister.
There's no' much left to eat, I'm afraid.

437
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:24,867
- It's after 2:30.
- I've had my dinner.

438
00:38:24,944 --> 00:38:28,088
I'm, uh... I'm fooling' for a dog,
and I was directed here.

439
00:38:28,165 --> 00:38:29,048
A dog?

440
00:38:29,124 --> 00:38:31,655
Aye, I'm from Cauldbrae,
and the dog belongs to my bairn.

441
00:38:31,732 --> 00:38:35,145
It ran away to follow an old shepherd body
that used to work for me.

442
00:38:35,222 --> 00:38:37,983
- Old Jock?
- Aye. You Now him?

443
00:38:38,059 --> 00:38:41,127
Well, where is he? It was nae right of him
to win that dog away from my bairn.

444
00:38:41,204 --> 00:38:43,889
Old Jock’s dead, mister.

445
00:38:43,927 --> 00:38:46,458
- Dead?
- Aye, of pneumonia.

446
00:38:46,534 --> 00:38:50,332
And buried these four days since
in old Greyfriars Schoolyard.

447
00:38:50,408 --> 00:38:52,172
Greyfriars?

448
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:54,857
That's over grand for
a shepherd body, isn't it?

449
00:38:54,895 --> 00:38:58,538
Aye, but no' so grand as heavenly.

450
00:38:58,576 --> 00:39:01,031
Oh, poor Old Jock.

451
00:39:01,108 --> 00:39:03,907
I should nae have let him go,
but I had no choice.

452
00:39:03,984 --> 00:39:06,323
I didn't realize he was that sick, mister.
If I had Known...

453
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,931
Well, he's dead.

454
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:12,612
Maybe there's others to blame.
The wee dog's been here every day since.

455
00:39:12,651 --> 00:39:16,064
He's over in the corner there,
sleeping off his dinner.

456
00:39:19,822 --> 00:39:22,047
Oh, aye, that's Bobby, all right.

457
00:39:22,124 --> 00:39:24,194
And here, that's Jock’s plaid
he's sleeping' on.

458
00:39:24,233 --> 00:39:27,531
I bought it from the keeper
of the lodging house he died in.

459
00:39:27,608 --> 00:39:30,100
He looks well-fed, too.

460
00:39:30,177 --> 00:39:33,053
- You've been very good to him, mister.
- If you think I was aiming' to sleep him...

461
00:39:33,091 --> 00:39:38,077
Oh, you could, if it was up to me, but
my bairn's grieving' her heart out for him.

462
00:39:38,153 --> 00:39:42,142
Oh. Well, it's best he should go,
in any case. He'll have none of me.

463
00:39:42,219 --> 00:39:45,823
Och, he eats here, but he lives in
the old lirlyard where he's no' permitted,

464
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:48,125
but that hard to catch.

465
00:39:51,883 --> 00:39:54,453
- Ah, tale him away.
- Aye, I'll tale him.

466
00:39:54,529 --> 00:39:57,789
- He'll have a home.
- Better hold him close. He'll no' like going'.

467
00:39:57,827 --> 00:40:00,780
Come on, Bobby. It's me, it's me.

468
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:02,698
Thanl you, mister.

469
00:40:06,035 --> 00:40:07,453
Here.

470
00:40:09,524 --> 00:40:12,554
Wrap him in the plaid.
It'll hold him firm and sleep him quiet.

471
00:40:14,778 --> 00:40:16,695
And tale him now. I'm busy.

472
00:40:23,675 --> 00:40:25,708
- Hi, Wattie.
- Hi.

473
00:40:25,785 --> 00:40:27,855
- Get up. Go on.
- Did you find Bobby, Father?

474
00:40:27,932 --> 00:40:30,348
Aye, I've got him here in the cart.

475
00:40:32,726 --> 00:40:34,797
Whoa, boy. Whoa.

476
00:40:40,856 --> 00:40:43,693
- Tale him away, Wattie.
- Right, Father.

477
00:40:46,992 --> 00:40:50,788
Just you settle down in here, laddie.
That's right.

478
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:53,972
Now, male him a bed out of that straw,
Elsie. That's right.

479
00:40:54,048 --> 00:40:56,042
- Underneath there.
- Poor Bobby.

480
00:40:56,119 --> 00:40:58,229
But bide here,
and I'll come for you in the morning.

481
00:40:58,305 --> 00:41:01,181
Aye, you'll have to feed him
and lead him on a rope for a wee while.

482
00:41:01,258 --> 00:41:04,173
But just leave him in here
until he's used to it, eh?

483
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:05,822
Now, come on, lassie.

484
00:41:05,899 --> 00:41:07,777
Bye-bye, Bobby.

485
00:41:20,471 --> 00:41:23,002
Now you've got Bobby back,
away to your bed.

486
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:27,297
Here, lassie. Tale Jessie with you.

487
00:41:27,336 --> 00:41:31,478
- Off you go now. Go on.
- Good night, Father. Good night, Mother.

488
00:41:31,555 --> 00:41:35,159
- Did you find him with Old Jock?
- No.

489
00:41:35,197 --> 00:41:37,307
Old Jock is dead.

490
00:41:37,346 --> 00:41:39,876
- Dead?
- Aye.

491
00:41:39,953 --> 00:41:42,752
Dead of pneumonia, poor old soul.

492
00:41:42,829 --> 00:41:45,897
But you Now what?
He's buried in Greyfriars itself.

493
00:41:45,974 --> 00:41:50,730
Old Jock among the lairds and ladies?
That's over grand for him.

494
00:41:50,806 --> 00:41:53,529
Well, his grave's nigh
to the Martyrs' Monument.

495
00:41:53,605 --> 00:41:56,482
And you Now, wee Bobby there
slept on it every night.

496
00:41:56,559 --> 00:41:59,703
And hid from the caretaker, too,
for it's strictly forbidden.

497
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:01,505
Oh, he's got nae respect
for the law, that yin.

498
00:45:20,657 --> 00:45:23,609
It's that dog.
And how did he get back?

499
00:45:25,106 --> 00:45:28,365
I'll put a stop to this.
John Traill told me a wicked lie.

500
00:45:28,441 --> 00:45:29,860
- Mr. Traill?
- Aye, he did.

501
00:45:29,937 --> 00:45:31,855
He said the dog had been tool away.

502
00:45:41,365 --> 00:45:45,738
So there you are. So you're back.
And how did you get back?

503
00:45:45,814 --> 00:45:50,302
Don't be fooling' so pleased with yourself.
You're breaking' the law of trespass.

504
00:45:50,378 --> 00:45:53,868
You hear?
And look at him. All mud and tangled hair.

505
00:45:53,944 --> 00:45:57,588
Like an old fishwife from Cowgate itself.
And just as useless.

506
00:45:57,665 --> 00:46:00,694
No' useless, Jamie.
See what he's done?

507
00:46:01,882 --> 00:46:04,031
Four great rats he's killed.

508
00:46:04,107 --> 00:46:07,060
You're a brave wee dog.

509
00:46:07,137 --> 00:46:10,780
- Och, laddie! Look at that.
- He's going out and staying out,

510
00:46:10,857 --> 00:46:12,736
if I have to tale him to the police myself.

511
00:46:12,812 --> 00:46:16,878
He's killed his own weight in vermin.
Look here, and over there too.

512
00:46:16,955 --> 00:46:19,140
And you Now well
how they pester the girl.

513
00:46:19,179 --> 00:46:21,479
Aye. I'm no' saying he
isna a bonny fighter.

514
00:46:21,518 --> 00:46:25,238
But he's still breaking' the law.
And there's only one thing to do with him.

515
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:27,884
Aye. There is only one thing to do.

516
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:31,451
And we'll do it right now.
We'll give him a good wash.

517
00:46:31,527 --> 00:46:34,902
A good wash? Have you taken leave
of your senses, woman?

518
00:46:34,978 --> 00:46:36,628
I'll do no such thing.

519
00:46:49,169 --> 00:46:52,313
And when he's dry, Jamie Brown,
he'll be needing his breakfast.

520
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:54,268
He looks fair thin.

521
00:46:54,345 --> 00:46:57,682
Breakfast now, is it?
A bit of liver and suchlike, no doubt.

522
00:46:57,759 --> 00:46:59,216
And a serving maid to wait on him.

523
00:46:59,292 --> 00:47:02,361
Oh, hold your grumbling, man.
I'll get him some scraps.

524
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:10,261
There now. Stop your struggling'.

525
00:47:11,488 --> 00:47:13,098
A trespasser, that's what you are.

526
00:47:13,175 --> 00:47:16,128
"No dogs permitted."
That's the rule. Mind ye that.

527
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:20,922
You'll no' beguile me,
because doggie, you're going out.

528
00:47:20,999 --> 00:47:22,916
Out! That's where you're going'.

529
00:47:22,993 --> 00:47:27,212
He's a bonny wee thing.
Ye cannot deny that, Jamie.

530
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:29,896
I was wishing you didn’t
have to send him away.

531
00:47:29,973 --> 00:47:32,542
I have my duty to the minister
and the girl authorities.

532
00:47:32,618 --> 00:47:34,153
And I willna discuss the matter.

533
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:36,684
Ach! There's no rule
against his living here wi' us.

534
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,678
Wi' us?

535
00:47:39,981 --> 00:47:42,091
Woman, I'll have no dog in my house.

536
00:47:42,168 --> 00:47:46,117
He'd be company for me... for us, Jamie.

537
00:47:46,194 --> 00:47:49,684
Och, man.
You used to say yourself years ago

538
00:47:49,761 --> 00:47:52,215
that a dog can be
as much company as a bairn.

539
00:47:52,292 --> 00:47:54,670
Aye. And male just as much noise.

540
00:48:00,116 --> 00:48:03,183
Now then, Bobby, come here.
I have work to do.

541
00:48:05,062 --> 00:48:06,942
There you go.

542
00:48:08,169 --> 00:48:10,470
Och.

543
00:48:10,508 --> 00:48:13,730
Ach, you're no' beguiling me. No.

544
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:25,695
Now then, there you are. Rat killin' or no.

545
00:48:25,772 --> 00:48:28,993
Look now.
"No dogs permitted" is the rule.

546
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:30,949
So out you go. Away with you.

547
00:48:35,206 --> 00:48:38,235
Run along. Away with you! Aye.

548
00:48:44,486 --> 00:48:49,357
Come along, girls.
And this, girls, is Greyfriars Schoolyard,

549
00:48:49,433 --> 00:48:52,118
the last resting place
of many distinguished people

550
00:48:52,195 --> 00:48:55,109
who have helped to shape
the history of Scotland.

551
00:48:55,876 --> 00:48:58,216
- Open the gates, caretaker.
- Aye.

552
00:48:58,293 --> 00:49:00,977
And mind, girls, not to tread on the grass.

553
00:49:01,015 --> 00:49:03,124
Aye. Back a wee bit, then.

554
00:49:13,556 --> 00:49:15,895
Ah. And good riddance.

555
00:49:15,971 --> 00:49:18,771
Jessie, Hamish, where you going?

556
00:49:21,647 --> 00:49:23,411
- Ailie, come quickly.
- What is it?

557
00:49:23,488 --> 00:49:25,444
It's the wee dog.

558
00:49:25,521 --> 00:49:27,400
Come on!

559
00:49:27,707 --> 00:49:29,701
Aye, it's him, I think.

560
00:49:30,314 --> 00:49:32,846
- He's very clean and brushed.
- But it's him, all right.

561
00:49:32,922 --> 00:49:36,297
He won't be very easy to catch
when Mr. Brown's around.

562
00:49:36,373 --> 00:49:38,713
No. We'll never catch him.

563
00:49:38,790 --> 00:49:40,631
Whisht, all of you!

564
00:49:40,707 --> 00:49:42,509
Mr. Traill will give us
a shilling if we do.

565
00:49:42,586 --> 00:49:45,578
Now remember, he told Ailie.
So listen here to me.

566
00:49:45,655 --> 00:49:48,109
I'll go to the front gate
and sleep Mr. Brown tailing

567
00:49:48,185 --> 00:49:50,755
while you all climb the wall
and catch the wee dog.

568
00:49:52,558 --> 00:49:55,855
- Thanl you, caretaker.
- You're welcome, ma'am.

569
00:49:57,927 --> 00:50:00,112
- Good day.
- Good day, ma'am.

570
00:50:05,136 --> 00:50:07,054
Good morning', Mr. Brown.

571
00:50:08,434 --> 00:50:09,431
What do you want?

572
00:50:09,509 --> 00:50:12,806
I was wondering' why the gates are closed
today. No' locked, but closed.

573
00:50:12,883 --> 00:50:15,874
To sleep out bairns and dogs
that male a disturbance.

574
00:50:36,507 --> 00:50:40,418
I don't Now what you're up to,
but dinna hang around my gates.

575
00:50:40,495 --> 00:50:42,719
I want no bairns from the tenements
in my lirlyard.

576
00:50:42,796 --> 00:50:46,324
- I willna have them.
- Aye, I can see that.

577
00:50:54,339 --> 00:50:56,372
Catch him, Ailie!

578
00:51:01,050 --> 00:51:02,355
Here. Out of here.

579
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:09,181
Out of here, all of ye!
How did that dog get in here? Come on.

580
00:51:09,258 --> 00:51:12,402
Oh, my goodness! Out!

581
00:51:14,051 --> 00:51:15,470
I never...

582
00:51:15,509 --> 00:51:17,349
Aye, you lot of blackguards.

583
00:51:21,108 --> 00:51:23,370
Come away in. It is nae locked.

584
00:51:26,898 --> 00:51:30,120
- We brought you the wee dog, Mr. Traill.
- Aye, we caught him.

585
00:51:30,196 --> 00:51:32,727
- But where did ye find him?
- He was sitting' in the lirlyard.

586
00:51:32,804 --> 00:51:35,450
He wasna hiding.
He was sitting' there on a stone.

587
00:51:35,527 --> 00:51:38,365
- Like he was living' there.
- You told Ailie to bring him here.

588
00:51:38,441 --> 00:51:41,433
How did ye get back, Bobby, and when?

589
00:51:41,510 --> 00:51:44,271
And man, you're all clean and brushed.

590
00:51:44,347 --> 00:51:47,569
Can it be you're no' hungry?
Shall we see?

591
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:49,870
- Do we get the shilling, Mr. Traill?
- Yes!

592
00:51:49,946 --> 00:51:51,289
In a minute.

593
00:52:02,985 --> 00:52:05,248
Mr. Traill must be very, very rich, Tammy.

594
00:52:05,324 --> 00:52:06,782
- Here, Bobby.
- Aye.

595
00:52:06,859 --> 00:52:09,198
Now, Bobby, come on. Here.

596
00:52:10,655 --> 00:52:11,575
There.

597
00:52:12,189 --> 00:52:14,797
I said a shilling for finding him.

598
00:52:15,334 --> 00:52:19,515
And a shilling it is.
Amongst six of ye, it's tuppence each.

599
00:52:21,662 --> 00:52:23,809
He's giving the wee dog chicken to eat.

600
00:52:25,075 --> 00:52:27,146
Real chicken?

601
00:52:27,223 --> 00:52:29,102
To a wee dog.

602
00:52:31,134 --> 00:52:33,551
Ailie, go and coll the street doors.

603
00:52:33,627 --> 00:52:36,848
Aye, coll them.
I'm no' open for customers yet.

604
00:52:36,887 --> 00:52:39,111
I was gonna have my own dinner first.

605
00:52:39,188 --> 00:52:41,144
And as I can nae eat alone,
we'll have a picnic.

606
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:43,981
What's a picnic?
Is it not some lind of a cale?

607
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:48,660
No, laddie. It's... well, when you have
a whole lot to eat and ye share it.

608
00:52:48,737 --> 00:52:50,731
Picnics are for summer
when ye eat outdoors.

609
00:52:50,769 --> 00:52:55,448
No, Tammy! It's like I said.
You can have a picnic at any time at all.

610
00:52:55,525 --> 00:52:57,979
Here. I'll show you.

611
00:52:58,055 --> 00:53:00,127
Oh, I forgot yours.

612
00:53:00,204 --> 00:53:02,773
Here. There you are.
Go on! Into the kitchen.

613
00:53:17,307 --> 00:53:19,034
Dinna stand there with your mouths open.

614
00:53:19,110 --> 00:53:22,983
Serve six dishes of the chicken stew
on the corner table there.

615
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:26,857
Mr. Traill's got so much dinner
he can't eat it all himself.

616
00:53:26,933 --> 00:53:29,311
Come on now, set yourselves down.

617
00:53:29,387 --> 00:53:31,804
And mind your manners.
Come on, Tammy.

618
00:53:38,592 --> 00:53:40,701
Ailie, pass the bread.

619
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:45,457
Chicken! Sings! I've never eaten it.

620
00:53:45,533 --> 00:53:49,598
Ah, Bobby! You've finished.
You're just in time to join the picnic.

621
00:53:58,150 --> 00:54:01,180
Malcolm! I said mind your manners.

622
00:54:02,368 --> 00:54:04,248
Tammy, say grace.

623
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:08,849
For what we are about to receive...
Amen.

624
00:54:08,888 --> 00:54:11,266
- I did nae hear you.
- I was nae speaking' to you.

625
00:54:14,755 --> 00:54:16,290
Eat.

626
00:54:19,856 --> 00:54:23,922
Tammy, it's just like the tales
you male up in your head.

627
00:54:23,998 --> 00:54:26,146
- Aye, it is.
- Does he male up tales?

628
00:54:26,222 --> 00:54:29,098
- Aye. And he can read too.
- Can he now?

629
00:54:29,904 --> 00:54:32,052
Aye. And he males up tales all the time.

630
00:54:32,128 --> 00:54:33,969
Like how he saves the queen
from drowning

631
00:54:34,045 --> 00:54:36,846
and we all get invited to a great banquet
at her castle in Balmoral and...

632
00:54:36,884 --> 00:54:41,293
Oh, stop it, will you?
It's just foolishness, Mr. Traill.

633
00:54:41,370 --> 00:54:44,592
Aye. And about him having grown
two new legs to run about on.

634
00:54:44,669 --> 00:54:47,046
Foolishness like that.

635
00:54:47,123 --> 00:54:50,383
Tammy, we shall have to
tale you to the infirmary.

636
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:53,757
I've many good friends there -
doctors that eat here.

637
00:54:53,834 --> 00:54:55,292
If they can nae give you new legs,

638
00:54:55,369 --> 00:54:59,241
they can give ye a pair of crutches that
are the next best thing and no' like these.

639
00:54:59,318 --> 00:55:01,197
Eh, Bobby?

640
00:55:07,563 --> 00:55:10,517
Come on, Bobby.
We're no' wanted here.

641
00:55:15,042 --> 00:55:17,113
Get on with your work.

642
00:55:20,257 --> 00:55:24,054
Have you ever had bread
that's soft like this and not hard?

643
00:55:27,121 --> 00:55:31,264
I'm glad you came back, Bobby,
though I don't Now how you did it.

644
00:55:31,302 --> 00:55:33,296
And I wish you'd stay with me.

645
00:55:33,373 --> 00:55:36,134
I'm not a bad man to live with.

646
00:55:36,211 --> 00:55:39,355
And I'm sick and tired of living' alone.

647
00:55:39,394 --> 00:55:41,810
I even envy Old Jock,

648
00:55:41,887 --> 00:55:44,954
for having someone to grieve
over his going.

649
00:55:45,031 --> 00:55:48,445
You think I'm a fool, don't ye?
Well, everybody Knows that.

650
00:56:09,537 --> 00:56:11,646
Ach, that's no' so bad.

651
00:56:18,971 --> 00:56:21,349
You're something foolish yourself, laddie.

652
00:56:21,426 --> 00:56:23,535
He's no' coming'.
He's no' coming' any more.

653
00:56:38,989 --> 00:56:41,482
I'm no' heeding' ye.

654
00:56:41,559 --> 00:56:44,358
You're a fool dog.

655
00:56:44,435 --> 00:56:46,698
You've good fire and good company.

656
00:56:46,775 --> 00:56:48,846
And it's bitter cold out there.

657
00:56:54,406 --> 00:56:56,477
Stop that noise down there!

658
00:56:57,704 --> 00:57:01,654
All right. All right.
But you're a pest of a dog.

659
00:57:03,917 --> 00:57:06,372
Now I'll have to go wi' ye to the lirlyard.

660
00:57:08,174 --> 00:57:11,203
You'll no' get in there now. It's locked.

661
00:57:18,529 --> 00:57:21,980
Ah... So you've come back.

662
00:57:22,056 --> 00:57:26,429
Ah, you can wag your fool tail.
Keeping me waiting here in the cold.

663
00:57:28,308 --> 00:57:31,990
Ach, well... Come in, ye wee fool.

664
00:57:36,514 --> 00:57:38,471
Ach...

665
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:42,957
Good evening, Mr. Brown.

666
00:57:43,034 --> 00:57:47,252
I thought there was a strict regulation
against dogs in the lirlyard.

667
00:57:47,291 --> 00:57:52,046
Aye, there is. And the dog will sleep in
my house the night, if that concerns you.

668
00:57:52,123 --> 00:57:56,303
- He'll no' sleep in anybody's house.
- No' in yours maybe.

669
00:57:56,341 --> 00:58:00,675
But my wife, Jeanie, has taken
a fancy to the dog. And he to us.

670
00:58:00,752 --> 00:58:01,863
Ha!

671
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:06,121
Aye. We found him this morning
all covered with mud and tired out.

672
00:58:06,159 --> 00:58:09,802
- We washed him, and he's grateful.
- And I feed him.

673
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:13,139
And ye bring him back
into the lirlyard at night in the cold.

674
00:58:13,215 --> 00:58:15,976
And against the law.

675
00:58:16,053 --> 00:58:19,160
The wee dog is sleeping in my house
the night and every night.

676
00:58:19,236 --> 00:58:22,419
And you've no need to bother
feeding him any more, Mr. Traill.

677
00:58:22,496 --> 00:58:24,759
The wee dog has turned to us.

678
00:58:24,836 --> 00:58:26,753
So good night to ye.

679
00:58:35,113 --> 00:58:37,951
Here! Where are ye off to?
Come here, boy!

680
00:58:39,753 --> 00:58:42,246
Ah, so there ye are.

681
00:58:44,241 --> 00:58:47,040
Now, you come to my house or out you go.

682
00:58:47,653 --> 00:58:49,993
Ye canna be living there.

683
00:58:50,070 --> 00:58:52,447
I told you that.

684
00:58:54,211 --> 00:58:57,241
If ye come into the house,
you can sleep before the fire.

685
00:58:57,318 --> 00:59:00,117
But you canna sleep here, laddie.

686
00:59:00,194 --> 00:59:02,380
You see, I'll lose my job.

687
00:59:02,457 --> 00:59:04,796
Ah, thanl you, Bobby. That's a good boy.

688
00:59:04,873 --> 00:59:07,442
Because I want you to come to the house.

689
00:59:07,518 --> 00:59:09,973
Whisht! Whisht! Hold your tongue!

690
00:59:14,115 --> 00:59:17,336
Ach... Ye never Now who your friends are.

691
00:59:18,525 --> 00:59:20,941
Man or dog.

692
00:59:21,977 --> 00:59:24,048
Jamie, are ye there?

693
00:59:25,658 --> 00:59:29,647
- Has the wee dog come back?
- Aye, he's come back.

694
00:59:30,490 --> 00:59:32,408
But no' to us.

695
01:00:19,924 --> 01:00:21,764
Come on, Bobby.

696
01:00:21,841 --> 01:00:24,218
That's a good boy.

697
01:00:25,982 --> 01:00:28,514
Is there no' one of you bairns
can leave my dog alone?

698
01:00:28,591 --> 01:00:31,351
- He's not your dog, Mr. Brown.
- He lives here.

699
01:00:31,428 --> 01:00:33,308
He's at Mr. Traill's as much as here,

700
01:00:33,346 --> 01:00:35,685
and out playing' with us
even more than that.

701
01:00:35,762 --> 01:00:40,057
- Bobby's a very independent dog.
- Ah! More big words, is it?

702
01:00:40,096 --> 01:00:42,626
They tell me that you're now
at Heriot's grand school.

703
01:00:42,703 --> 01:00:44,582
Huh! A boy like you from the tenements.

704
01:00:44,659 --> 01:00:47,267
Aye. Mr. Traill's persuaded
the master there to tale me.

705
01:00:47,344 --> 01:00:51,792
Mr. Traill does a mighty lot of interfering
into other people's affairs, if you asl me.

706
01:00:51,868 --> 01:00:54,515
And why would he want to get a bairn
like you into such a fine school?

707
01:00:54,592 --> 01:00:56,547
Well, he said my legs'll never be any good,

708
01:00:56,624 --> 01:00:59,194
so I have to learn
to male a living' with my head.

709
01:00:59,271 --> 01:01:04,064
Ah, well... Well, then,
don't waste your time playing with dogs.

710
01:01:04,140 --> 01:01:06,059
Be off with ye!

711
01:01:08,398 --> 01:01:10,315
Tammy, bring Bobby out to play!

712
01:01:10,392 --> 01:01:12,847
- Aye, I'll bring him.
- Whisht! Whisht!

713
01:01:12,923 --> 01:01:16,298
This is a lirlyard.
Have ye no respect, ye young heathen?

714
01:01:16,374 --> 01:01:19,059
Just going', Mr. Brown.

715
01:01:21,015 --> 01:01:23,852
And remember, I don't want you bringing'
that dog back covered with mud

716
01:01:23,929 --> 01:01:26,691
to foul my kitchen. Did ye hear me?

717
01:01:30,525 --> 01:01:32,903
There's Bobby.

718
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:34,897
Are ye coming' to play with us?

719
01:01:36,776 --> 01:01:38,924
Come on! Come on, Bobby!

720
01:01:42,222 --> 01:01:45,597
What with Traill and the bairns,
the dog belongs to nobody.

721
01:01:45,674 --> 01:01:47,783
- Hm?
- Good riddance to him.

722
01:01:49,815 --> 01:01:53,382
- Are ye tallin' to me, Mr. Brown?
- No, I was not.

723
01:01:53,421 --> 01:01:56,220
- I was tallin' about yon wee dog.
- Aye?

724
01:01:56,296 --> 01:02:00,362
I've been watching' that dog running' about
the streets here for a long time.

725
01:02:00,438 --> 01:02:03,506
But he's too quick.
I've never been able to catch him.

726
01:02:03,583 --> 01:02:05,463
Catch him? For what?

727
01:02:05,539 --> 01:02:09,489
Why? Is he your dog? Are you keepin'
a dog in the lirlyard, Mr. Brown?

728
01:02:09,565 --> 01:02:12,365
He's no' my dog.
But why would you want to catch him?

729
01:02:12,442 --> 01:02:14,398
He's got no collar.

730
01:02:14,474 --> 01:02:17,811
Maybe he's got no license
and that's against the law.

731
01:02:17,888 --> 01:02:20,725
Aye. And we all Now
that the law of Scotland

732
01:02:20,802 --> 01:02:23,832
couldna last another day
without you, Mr. MacLean.

733
01:02:25,174 --> 01:02:27,667
If he's no' your dog, whose is he?

734
01:02:29,661 --> 01:02:31,694
I wouldna Now.

735
01:02:35,490 --> 01:02:39,095
But, uh, why don't you asl Mr. Traill?

736
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:40,246
Hm.

737
01:02:40,322 --> 01:02:44,234
He seems to Now everything
about everybody here in Greyfriars.

738
01:02:44,311 --> 01:02:46,688
Aye. Asl him.

739
01:02:51,482 --> 01:02:53,361
Mr. Traill.

740
01:02:54,358 --> 01:02:56,276
Good afternoon to ye, Davie.

741
01:02:58,539 --> 01:03:00,456
And how are you?

742
01:03:01,453 --> 01:03:04,368
Finish with your tables, lassie.
He's no' come for you.

743
01:03:04,445 --> 01:03:08,547
So you've got a wee dog here now,
John, eh? I did nae Now.

744
01:03:08,625 --> 01:03:11,463
Well, maybe there's still a few things
you don't Now, Davie.

745
01:03:11,539 --> 01:03:13,418
The wee dog's a customer of mine.

746
01:03:13,495 --> 01:03:16,793
- I'm not here for joles.
- Ach, away, man. Dinna be so pompous.

747
01:03:16,870 --> 01:03:19,324
I'm here in the line of duty.

748
01:03:19,401 --> 01:03:21,741
Are you Mr. John Traill?

749
01:03:23,274 --> 01:03:26,189
What ails ye, man? You Now my name
as well as you Now your own.

750
01:03:26,265 --> 01:03:30,216
It's a formality of the law
to male you admit your identity.

751
01:03:30,254 --> 01:03:32,171
Here's a bit paper for ye.

752
01:03:34,242 --> 01:03:39,189
You're summoned to appear before
the magistrate in the burgh court tomorrow

753
01:03:39,266 --> 01:03:43,293
to answer a charge of owning
or harboring one dog,

754
01:03:43,370 --> 01:03:46,974
upon which you have not paid
the license tax of seven shillings.

755
01:03:47,819 --> 01:03:51,845
Mind you, if the seven shillings
were to be paid in before tomorrow,

756
01:03:51,921 --> 01:03:53,724
the charge would not be pursued.

757
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:55,834
Who says I own or harbor a dog?

758
01:03:55,910 --> 01:03:57,789
I can use my eyes, can't I?

759
01:03:57,866 --> 01:04:00,511
- Can ye use your head?
- Yes, I can!

760
01:04:00,589 --> 01:04:04,232
I've been watching that dog
for a long, long time,

761
01:04:04,309 --> 01:04:08,604
and now just this weel
there's new rules about dogs in the city.

762
01:04:08,681 --> 01:04:12,055
And you think you'll force me
to pay the license for him, don't ye?

763
01:04:12,132 --> 01:04:14,740
And I think I Now who's behind all this.

764
01:04:14,817 --> 01:04:17,654
That old fool in the lirlyard, James Brown.

765
01:04:19,380 --> 01:04:22,985
I'll see to this right away.
So you can tale yourself off.

766
01:04:24,442 --> 01:04:26,552
- You mean you'll pay?
- No!

767
01:04:27,472 --> 01:04:30,732
Then you'll present yourself
to the court tomorrow.

768
01:04:32,150 --> 01:04:35,564
Mr. Traill, what does it mean?
Is it no' a joke?

769
01:04:35,641 --> 01:04:37,481
No, it's no joke at all, lassie.

770
01:04:37,558 --> 01:04:40,013
The municipal court of Edinburgh
is very important.

771
01:04:40,089 --> 01:04:43,464
The lord provost himself sits on the
bench there when it's his turn to do so.

772
01:04:43,540 --> 01:04:46,494
It's a serious matter.
Well, I have calls to male.

773
01:04:46,571 --> 01:04:49,868
You and the laddie do your work
while I'm away.

774
01:04:51,172 --> 01:04:53,435
Bobby! You come with me.

775
01:05:05,516 --> 01:05:09,772
Mrs. Brown, I... I wish to
have a word with your husband.

776
01:05:11,114 --> 01:05:12,457
On a matter of business.

777
01:05:12,495 --> 01:05:15,103
I'm afraid he isna very
well today, Mr. Traill.

778
01:05:15,179 --> 01:05:18,631
He's sleeping in his bed.
Can I give him a message?

779
01:05:18,670 --> 01:05:22,197
No. It's a very particular matter.

780
01:05:23,424 --> 01:05:25,572
I'll attend to it myself.

781
01:05:28,563 --> 01:05:31,593
Hadn't you better tale your dog inside?

782
01:05:37,613 --> 01:05:41,526
Bobby! Bobby, my wee... my wee bairn.

783
01:05:44,401 --> 01:05:47,930
Case against John Traill.
Is Mr. Traill in court?

784
01:05:48,620 --> 01:05:50,269
I'm here.

785
01:06:00,394 --> 01:06:05,226
John Traill, you are the landlord of
Traill's Dining Rooms in Greyfriars Place.

786
01:06:05,303 --> 01:06:07,872
I certainly am.
And everybody here Knows I am.

787
01:06:07,949 --> 01:06:12,321
You are required merely to admit
your identity. Read the charge.

788
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:16,654
You have been summoned here
to answer the charge

789
01:06:16,730 --> 01:06:21,563
that you, John Traill, are harboring a dog,
unlicensed and stray,

790
01:06:21,639 --> 01:06:23,941
in contravention of
the new orders and powers

791
01:06:24,018 --> 01:06:27,200
invested in the burgh police
to apprehend such animals.

792
01:06:27,277 --> 01:06:29,501
Do you plead guilty or not guilty?

793
01:06:29,578 --> 01:06:31,342
- Not guilty.
- Very well.

794
01:06:31,994 --> 01:06:33,911
Call Sergeant MacLean.

795
01:06:40,278 --> 01:06:42,348
I swear by Almighty God
to tell the truth, the whole truth,

796
01:06:42,386 --> 01:06:44,573
nothing but the truth, so help me, God.

797
01:06:44,650 --> 01:06:46,529
Sergeant MacLean,

798
01:06:46,605 --> 01:06:50,287
the deposition you made to this court
is correct in every particular?

799
01:06:50,364 --> 01:06:52,089
Yes, sir.

800
01:06:52,166 --> 01:06:57,612
I followed the said dog into Mr. Traill's
place and saw the said dog eating there

801
01:06:57,689 --> 01:07:02,368
and being sheltered by the accused, who
did not deny the presence of the said dog.

802
01:07:02,444 --> 01:07:05,550
There's an awful lot of "said"
about this wee dog.

803
01:07:05,627 --> 01:07:08,926
Did he no' say anything to you?

804
01:07:09,002 --> 01:07:11,380
Order.

805
01:07:11,456 --> 01:07:15,061
You will confine
your observations to the bench.

806
01:07:15,137 --> 01:07:17,094
Now then, are you denying
the sergeant's statement?

807
01:07:17,170 --> 01:07:20,315
I'm no' denying the fact that he saw
that wee dog on my premises, Your Honor.

808
01:07:20,391 --> 01:07:23,575
- Aye, that's what I've heard.
- The dog is not my dog.

809
01:07:23,652 --> 01:07:26,259
I'm no' his master.
He doesn’t sleep under my roof.

810
01:07:26,336 --> 01:07:28,330
Then who is his master
and where does he sleep?

811
01:07:28,407 --> 01:07:31,321
His master's in his grave in old
Greyfriars Schoolyard these many months,

812
01:07:31,398 --> 01:07:32,740
and the dog sleeps on the mound.

813
01:07:32,778 --> 01:07:34,888
Jim, wale up. This might be a story.

814
01:07:34,965 --> 01:07:38,148
Do you mean to tell this court
that a dog could sleep out in the open,

815
01:07:38,224 --> 01:07:40,487
all through the winter,
in a graveyard?

816
01:07:40,563 --> 01:07:41,983
This one has, Your Honor.

817
01:07:42,021 --> 01:07:45,242
He's a Skye terrier with a coat on him
as thick as the thatch on the roof.

818
01:07:45,281 --> 01:07:47,966
Have you any witnesses
to prove such a ridiculous story?

819
01:07:48,042 --> 01:07:53,487
The caretaker of the lirlyard, like myself,
has been a sort of friend of the wee dog,

820
01:07:53,564 --> 01:07:56,057
and nae doubt would be pleased
to tell Your Honor so

821
01:07:56,134 --> 01:08:00,659
but for the misfortune he's so sick
he can nae leave his house.

822
01:08:01,887 --> 01:08:05,261
But nae doubt, if necessary,
his deposition could be taken.

823
01:08:05,338 --> 01:08:07,601
Do the Greyfriars Kirk authorities
Now about this?

824
01:08:07,639 --> 01:08:10,438
I've been to inform the minister,
Dr. Lee, Your Honor.

825
01:08:10,515 --> 01:08:14,964
But he's no' in Edinburgh.
He's away in France... for his health.

826
01:08:15,041 --> 01:08:17,993
There would seem to be no witnesses
who are not in poor health.

827
01:08:18,070 --> 01:08:20,716
Aye, Your Honor. Half a hundred children
in the tenements there

828
01:08:20,755 --> 01:08:23,631
see him every day and have made
a great pet of the wee dog.

829
01:08:23,669 --> 01:08:26,698
If you regard them
as competent witnesses.

830
01:08:26,776 --> 01:08:28,616
Though most of them are over young.

831
01:08:28,693 --> 01:08:31,377
Mr. Traill, are you being impertinent?

832
01:08:31,454 --> 01:08:35,212
Certainly not! You asked me for witnesses
that Bobby sleeps in the lirlyard.

833
01:08:35,251 --> 01:08:38,050
Mr. Traill, I don't Now
if you've consulted a lawyer

834
01:08:38,127 --> 01:08:39,815
about this charge of harboring the dog...

835
01:08:39,853 --> 01:08:43,841
I think I've a good enough tongue
in my head to be my own lawyer.

836
01:08:43,918 --> 01:08:47,485
Your tongue is certainly
long enough, Mr. Traill.

837
01:08:47,561 --> 01:08:51,434
If this dog is owner less and unlicensed,
it will have to be taken up by the police.

838
01:08:51,511 --> 01:08:55,423
- That does nae seem fair to me.
- Fair, sir? Fair? That is the law!

839
01:08:55,499 --> 01:08:58,107
Master less dogs have become
a perfect nuisance in this town.

840
01:08:58,184 --> 01:09:00,945
Unless this dog's license is paid,
it will have to be put away,

841
01:09:01,022 --> 01:09:02,517
and that'll be the end of the matter.

842
01:09:02,594 --> 01:09:05,393
Now, sir, are you prepared to pay?

843
01:09:05,470 --> 01:09:08,078
Or am I to male out an order
for this dog to be taken?

844
01:09:08,155 --> 01:09:11,759
It's no' a matter of seven shillings
for a dog's license, Your Honor.

845
01:09:11,836 --> 01:09:15,058
- This is a matter of principle.
- Principle? What principle?

846
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:17,243
I can nae be responsible
for what is not my own.

847
01:09:17,282 --> 01:09:20,197
The dog is no' with me
for more than two hours out of the 24.

848
01:09:20,274 --> 01:09:22,843
The rest of the time he's in the lirlyard,
sleeping and working.

849
01:09:22,919 --> 01:09:25,182
- Working?
- Aye, working!

850
01:09:25,259 --> 01:09:28,250
He's employed in the lirlyard
killing vermin and the like

851
01:09:28,327 --> 01:09:32,354
that the hardworking caretaker, Mr. Brown,
is no' able to do for himself.

852
01:09:34,501 --> 01:09:36,840
Order!

853
01:09:36,917 --> 01:09:39,794
Mr. Traill, you refuse to pay this license.

854
01:09:39,870 --> 01:09:42,785
- On a matter of principle...
- Kindly don't interrupt!

855
01:09:42,861 --> 01:09:45,738
Quite apart from the question of
the license, there is something else.

856
01:09:45,815 --> 01:09:48,077
According to the law,
you are guilty of harboring a stray

857
01:09:48,154 --> 01:09:50,186
without reporting the fact to the police.

858
01:09:50,263 --> 01:09:53,178
For that, the minimum fine
of five shillings will be imposed.

859
01:09:53,254 --> 01:09:57,012
And if I pay the license against my
principles, the fine will no' be imposed?

860
01:09:57,051 --> 01:09:58,010
That is so.

861
01:09:58,048 --> 01:10:01,231
In that case, Your Honor,
I shall appeal against your decision

862
01:10:01,308 --> 01:10:03,685
to the lord provost
and all the other magistrates

863
01:10:03,762 --> 01:10:07,252
- and then to the court of sessions!
- Mr. Traill, the high judiciary

864
01:10:07,329 --> 01:10:09,898
have more important business than
reviewing small matters of this lind.

865
01:10:09,974 --> 01:10:11,931
It's no' a small matter for me

866
01:10:12,008 --> 01:10:15,152
to be entered into the burgh
court's records as a lawbreaker!

867
01:10:15,190 --> 01:10:20,406
If I refuse to pay the license, but continue
to feed the wee dog as I always have,

868
01:10:20,483 --> 01:10:22,285
you'll hold me in contempt of court.

869
01:10:22,362 --> 01:10:24,778
- If you're asking for information...
- I'm no' asking for anything.

870
01:10:24,855 --> 01:10:27,002
I'm making plain my own line of conduct.

871
01:10:27,079 --> 01:10:31,413
But you're asking me to let a wee dog
starve for a legal technicality.

872
01:10:33,177 --> 01:10:35,516
Order! Silence!

873
01:10:35,592 --> 01:10:39,236
Mr. Traill, are you defying this court?

874
01:10:40,233 --> 01:10:42,303
Certainly not, Your Honor.

875
01:10:42,380 --> 01:10:44,413
You deny ownership of this wretched dog.

876
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:46,561
Yet you bring no witnesses
to support your story?

877
01:10:46,599 --> 01:10:50,243
No witnesses, Your Honor.
But by your leave, I'd like to say this:

878
01:10:50,319 --> 01:10:55,189
Davie, the next time you're near
my dining rooms... come in

879
01:10:55,266 --> 01:10:59,178
and let the wee dog you're persecuting
give you a lesson in manners and morals.

880
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:02,092
Bobby at least has never bit
the hand that feeds him.

881
01:11:02,821 --> 01:11:04,777
But you have, Davie.

882
01:11:04,854 --> 01:11:07,231
And you've had many a free meal from me.

883
01:11:08,995 --> 01:11:10,300
Silence!

884
01:11:11,757 --> 01:11:14,019
Mr. Traill, on your own admission,

885
01:11:14,096 --> 01:11:17,126
you are guilty of harboring a stray
without reporting it as such.

886
01:11:17,202 --> 01:11:21,190
You will therefore present yourself here -
and bring the dog with you...

887
01:11:21,267 --> 01:11:25,678
at half past eight of the clock
before this court goes into session.

888
01:11:25,754 --> 01:11:27,135
Have I no' a chance to appeal,
Your Honor?

889
01:11:27,211 --> 01:11:30,011
Half past eight of the clock
here tomorrow morning.

890
01:11:30,050 --> 01:11:32,427
Step down if you please, Mr. Traill.

891
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:50,758
Ailie, lassie.

892
01:11:53,558 --> 01:11:56,281
Did ye ever give a wee dog a good wash?

893
01:11:56,358 --> 01:11:58,543
You mean Bobby, Mr. Traill? No.

894
01:11:58,620 --> 01:12:02,494
But Tammy's sometimes washed him for Mr.
Brown and says it's no difficult matter.

895
01:12:02,570 --> 01:12:07,018
Aye... Mr.
Brown's in poor health, I'm told.

896
01:12:07,095 --> 01:12:11,927
So there's no chance of Bobby getting washed
again until the sickness is all gone.

897
01:12:12,004 --> 01:12:15,954
But I want him washed, Ailie.
He has serious business ahead of him.

898
01:12:16,031 --> 01:12:18,792
- He has?
- Aye. Very serious.

899
01:12:18,830 --> 01:12:21,784
So you bring him here clean and brushed
at 8:00 in the morning.

900
01:12:21,860 --> 01:12:25,158
Are ye talin' him somewhere, Mr. Traill?
Is it a picnic?

901
01:12:25,196 --> 01:12:27,728
Aye, I'm talin' him somewhere, lassie,

902
01:12:27,805 --> 01:12:31,102
but it's no' a picnic.

903
01:12:31,141 --> 01:12:33,634
It's a serious matter

904
01:12:33,672 --> 01:12:35,360
of principle.

905
01:12:40,882 --> 01:12:42,761
But you've done your work. Off you go.

906
01:12:42,838 --> 01:12:44,755
Now gang away home.

907
01:13:08,801 --> 01:13:10,143
We're right on time, Mr. Traill.

908
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:12,713
We washed him clean and combed him
with my granny's comb.

909
01:13:12,789 --> 01:13:15,243
Aye. He looks a picture. Here.

910
01:13:16,279 --> 01:13:18,272
Here's a penny for each of you.

911
01:13:18,349 --> 01:13:21,648
Ailie, you can give Tammy
some of the porridge cooling' on the fire.

912
01:13:21,686 --> 01:13:23,795
But where are you talin' Bobby, Mr. Traill?

913
01:13:23,872 --> 01:13:26,672
To see someone of importance, laddie.

914
01:13:26,710 --> 01:13:28,781
But I willna tale you tied, Bobby.

915
01:13:28,857 --> 01:13:31,465
Here. There's me boy.

916
01:13:31,541 --> 01:13:33,000
Come on.

917
01:13:33,076 --> 01:13:35,377
Come on now. There's a boy.

918
01:13:35,454 --> 01:13:36,719
Hello, Ailie.

919
01:13:36,757 --> 01:13:39,327
You're, uh, working'
for Mr. Traill now, are ye?

920
01:13:39,404 --> 01:13:41,436
Aye. For a whole weel now.

921
01:13:41,513 --> 01:13:44,965
Did, uh, Mr. Traill tell you about
the burgh court yesterday?

922
01:13:45,042 --> 01:13:48,109
- About him and the wee dog?
- No. Why?

923
01:13:48,186 --> 01:13:52,251
- He's just taken Bobby with him now.
- Aye. To see someone of importance.

924
01:13:52,328 --> 01:13:54,629
Och, that's just his way of putting it.

925
01:13:54,667 --> 01:13:58,311
He's taking Bobby to stand before
the burgh court as he was ordered to.

926
01:13:58,349 --> 01:14:00,496
Tale Bobby? Why?

927
01:14:00,573 --> 01:14:03,487
Well, if a dog has no master
to pay for his license,

928
01:14:03,564 --> 01:14:05,980
the police tale him up
and put him out of the way.

929
01:14:06,057 --> 01:14:07,361
- What?
- Aye.

930
01:14:07,399 --> 01:14:10,083
And Mr. Traill willna pay the license
because Bobby's no' his dog.

931
01:14:10,122 --> 01:14:12,692
How much are they wanting'
for the license, then?

932
01:14:12,768 --> 01:14:16,488
- Seven shillings.
- Seven shillings!

933
01:14:16,564 --> 01:14:19,633
- But that's a fortune.
- Aye.

934
01:14:19,710 --> 01:14:23,352
But I canna stop here tailing.
I'm over late for work.

935
01:14:23,429 --> 01:14:26,267
Seven shillings to allow
one wee dog to live.

936
01:14:26,344 --> 01:14:31,905
Not anybody - not even Mr. Traill -
ever had seven shillings all at once.

937
01:14:31,943 --> 01:14:36,046
I have the penny Mr. Traill just gave me.
How much have you, Tammy?

938
01:14:36,123 --> 01:14:39,153
Seven shillings is 84 pennies,

939
01:14:39,230 --> 01:14:42,105
168 halfpennies...

940
01:14:42,182 --> 01:14:45,366
and 336 farthings.

941
01:14:45,404 --> 01:14:49,085
But there's more foll around the old
lirlyard than farthings in seven shillings.

942
01:14:49,123 --> 01:14:51,042
Yes, Ailie, but they're over poor.

943
01:14:51,118 --> 01:14:54,262
But, Tammy, we have to get it.
Mr. Traill has gone to give him up.

944
01:14:54,301 --> 01:14:57,906
He was wearing all his good clothes
and a long face to go to Bobby's burial.

945
01:14:57,983 --> 01:14:59,977
Not if we can get the money first.

946
01:15:00,053 --> 01:15:02,699
Tell everybody, Ailie -
everybody you can find.

947
01:15:02,776 --> 01:15:06,036
And I will too.
Every bairn in Greyfriars, Ailie. And run!

948
01:15:07,953 --> 01:15:10,255
Have you any money
to save the wee dog's life?

949
01:15:10,293 --> 01:15:13,821
I'm looking for the man Traill,
the case with the dog. Have you seen him?

950
01:15:13,898 --> 01:15:16,966
You can nae go in there until
the court is in session, at 9:00.

951
01:15:17,043 --> 01:15:19,152
- But I'm a member of the press...
- That's my orders, sir,

952
01:15:19,228 --> 01:15:21,222
from the lord provost himself.

953
01:15:21,299 --> 01:15:26,361
Oh? The lord provost isn't listed
to be here today. I think I'd better wait.

954
01:15:26,438 --> 01:15:29,238
And as many would say,
this is no' much of a case

955
01:15:29,315 --> 01:15:31,846
for the lord provost to bother
his head about, Your Worship.

956
01:15:31,922 --> 01:15:34,836
I must be the judge of that, Mr. Traill.

957
01:15:36,333 --> 01:15:40,666
Sergeant MacLean has
the prisoner in custody, I see.

958
01:15:40,742 --> 01:15:42,891
Now, Mr. Traill, the points
at issue are very simple.

959
01:15:42,967 --> 01:15:46,533
Do you give food and shelter to this dog?
And do you own him?

960
01:15:46,610 --> 01:15:49,487
- Let's tale the first point first.
- Aye, I lodge him.

961
01:15:49,564 --> 01:15:52,133
Uh, I've always fed the wee dog,
ever since...

962
01:15:52,209 --> 01:15:54,280
Well, I've always fed him
and I'm no' denying' it.

963
01:15:54,357 --> 01:15:56,543
Why did you, if he is not your own?

964
01:15:56,620 --> 01:15:59,726
Well, at first, to ease my conscience,

965
01:15:59,802 --> 01:16:02,948
because I blame myself in part
for the death of the wee dog's master.

966
01:16:02,986 --> 01:16:05,785
You said "at first." What then?

967
01:16:07,089 --> 01:16:10,771
Och, uh... I've courted the wee terrier
for a long, long time since then,

968
01:16:10,847 --> 01:16:13,531
because I've nobody of my own.

969
01:16:13,570 --> 01:16:18,287
But he'll have none of me.
Except he's friendly and polite.

970
01:16:18,364 --> 01:16:20,281
He just grieves for the
old man that's dead.

971
01:16:20,319 --> 01:16:23,043
The law says the dog must have an owner.

972
01:16:23,119 --> 01:16:26,992
And I canna claim to be that,
Your Lordship, because it's no' true.

973
01:16:29,179 --> 01:16:32,208
But I cannot believe the law would male
a man abandon his principles and lie

974
01:16:32,285 --> 01:16:38,267
or... tale the life of a wee dog for a matter
of a few shillings and a piece of paper.

975
01:16:39,188 --> 01:16:42,601
The law deals with facts,
not with emotions, Mr. Traill.

976
01:16:43,445 --> 01:16:45,707
The dog is owner less

977
01:16:45,784 --> 01:16:47,664
and unlicensed.

978
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:57,979
Is there a case about a wee dog in there?

979
01:16:58,056 --> 01:17:01,124
- You can nae go in there.
- You see, Jeanie? I told you that.

980
01:17:01,201 --> 01:17:04,077
Whisht, man. My husband and I
are important witnesses in the case.

981
01:17:04,154 --> 01:17:06,071
Is it in there?

982
01:17:07,874 --> 01:17:09,983
Here! You can nae go in there,

983
01:17:14,202 --> 01:17:16,234
We are the dog's owners, sir.

984
01:17:17,614 --> 01:17:21,143
Begging your pardon, Your Lordship,
but that's right. That's right.

985
01:17:21,641 --> 01:17:23,980
James Brown, you're telling a lie!

986
01:17:24,057 --> 01:17:28,813
He's the caretaker of the lirlyard, Your
Lordship, that's so sick at home in bed.

987
01:17:28,851 --> 01:17:34,412
Constable, let these two witnesses in -
no one else. You stay outside.

988
01:17:45,419 --> 01:17:48,908
- Your name?
- James Brown, Your Lordship.

989
01:17:48,985 --> 01:17:51,977
- You claim ownership of the dog?
- Aye, we do.

990
01:17:52,053 --> 01:17:53,855
And we've come
to pay the license for him.

991
01:17:53,894 --> 01:17:56,194
Aye, my wife has the money
here in her purse.

992
01:17:56,271 --> 01:17:58,573
We just heard about the dog
being taken up and I thought...

993
01:17:58,649 --> 01:18:02,445
Yes, yes, Mr. Brown. You're claiming
ownership. In that case...

994
01:18:02,522 --> 01:18:06,358
It's no' the case at all, Your Lordship!
James Brown is not the owner of the dog.

995
01:18:06,434 --> 01:18:08,735
If I pay for him, I am.

996
01:18:09,617 --> 01:18:12,455
You have no legal right
to Bobby any more than I.

997
01:18:12,532 --> 01:18:14,679
Mr. Brown.

998
01:18:14,718 --> 01:18:17,748
Does the dog sleep under your roof?

999
01:18:17,824 --> 01:18:20,163
Well...

1000
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:22,579
No, Your Lordship. No' at night.

1001
01:18:22,617 --> 01:18:25,379
No, I canna say that.
He sleeps in the lirlyard.

1002
01:18:25,456 --> 01:18:29,060
With the minister's permission, of course?

1003
01:18:29,137 --> 01:18:33,126
Well... no, Your Lordship,
I canna say that.

1004
01:18:33,202 --> 01:18:37,268
Och! This is but a wee dog that holds
its gab, and it's very respectful.

1005
01:18:37,344 --> 01:18:40,719
Aye, and he's only been there
such a short time, Your Lordship.

1006
01:18:40,795 --> 01:18:43,672
For some months, Mr. Brown.

1007
01:18:43,711 --> 01:18:46,280
The minister told me that himself.

1008
01:18:46,356 --> 01:18:48,235
The minister Knows?
He told Your Lordship?

1009
01:18:48,312 --> 01:18:51,380
He was told by the bible reader
at the funeral.

1010
01:18:51,457 --> 01:18:54,716
Then by the minister at Cauldbrae
where the dog once lived.

1011
01:18:54,793 --> 01:18:56,980
And might live now,

1012
01:18:57,056 --> 01:18:59,970
if you had not fed him every day
to sleep him here.

1013
01:19:00,047 --> 01:19:02,309
The fools at Cauldbrae didn’t
license him, Your Lordship,

1014
01:19:02,386 --> 01:19:04,266
or there'd be no charge for the lack of it.

1015
01:19:04,343 --> 01:19:07,333
I'm paying for Bobby's license myself,
John Traill.

1016
01:19:07,410 --> 01:19:10,785
Ye'll do no such thing, James Brown.

1017
01:19:13,278 --> 01:19:18,072
In all my life, I've never surrendered
a principle before, Your Lordship.

1018
01:19:19,452 --> 01:19:22,636
But the charge is on me, and I'll...
I'll pay it.

1019
01:19:22,712 --> 01:19:27,314
I feel I must point out to you both that
the dog sleeps under neither of your roofs,

1020
01:19:27,390 --> 01:19:29,845
so belongs no more to one
than to the other.

1021
01:19:29,922 --> 01:19:33,220
I was summonsed to license him
and be his owner.

1022
01:19:33,258 --> 01:19:35,175
- And I will.
- But I asked first!

1023
01:19:35,214 --> 01:19:37,592
Perhaps both of you are thinking more
of winning an argument

1024
01:19:37,669 --> 01:19:39,777
than winning the dog.

1025
01:19:39,854 --> 01:19:46,144
A dog needs a home. But it needs love,
too. That more than anything.

1026
01:19:46,220 --> 01:19:49,097
Your Lordship, do ye think
he does nae get that?

1027
01:19:49,174 --> 01:19:51,244
Because he most certainly does.

1028
01:19:51,321 --> 01:19:55,617
No' only from me and my wife,
but from every child in Greyfriars.

1029
01:19:55,693 --> 01:19:57,342
They feel he's one of them.

1030
01:19:57,419 --> 01:20:00,716
Your Lordship, dinna send him
away from the lirlyard.

1031
01:20:00,793 --> 01:20:06,085
For many of the bairns in Greyfriars,
Bobby is the only love they Now.

1032
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:13,947
What are you bairns doin' in here?

1033
01:20:14,024 --> 01:20:15,865
Come on. Out of it.

1034
01:20:15,904 --> 01:20:17,629
Go on, the lot of ye. Out!

1035
01:20:17,706 --> 01:20:20,812
Mister, mister, we're fooling'
for Greyfriars Bobby.

1036
01:20:20,888 --> 01:20:22,691
Aye. And Mr. Traill that brought him here.

1037
01:20:22,768 --> 01:20:25,491
Are you going out or no'?
Young savages in the burgh court!

1038
01:20:25,567 --> 01:20:27,446
Have ye taken leave of your senses?

1039
01:20:27,524 --> 01:20:29,518
Look for yourselves! Look!

1040
01:20:34,772 --> 01:20:38,683
- Y-y-your Lordship!
- Silence. Close the door.

1041
01:20:54,637 --> 01:20:56,746
Look! He's not dead.

1042
01:21:01,962 --> 01:21:03,994
Will it be all right now, Mr. Traill?

1043
01:21:04,071 --> 01:21:07,139
I've got the money for a license
in my bonnet, Mr. Traill.

1044
01:21:08,136 --> 01:21:10,168
Is it you I pay, mister?

1045
01:21:11,472 --> 01:21:13,505
It's seven shillings
if you wish to count.

1046
01:21:13,544 --> 01:21:16,803
But where did you bairns get
all this money from? And how?

1047
01:21:16,841 --> 01:21:20,446
Everybody around the lirlyard gave it,
to pay the police not to male Bobby dead.

1048
01:21:20,523 --> 01:21:22,402
I gave a farthing, Mr. Traill.

1049
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:25,086
Aye, near every bairn we asked.
I gave a penny.

1050
01:21:25,124 --> 01:21:27,656
Everybody gave something.

1051
01:21:27,733 --> 01:21:29,688
Whisht! Whisht!

1052
01:21:29,765 --> 01:21:33,179
Have ye no respect for where ye are?
In the great burgh court.

1053
01:21:33,217 --> 01:21:36,131
- Whisht!
- Mr. Traill, hand the dog up here.

1054
01:21:42,689 --> 01:21:45,412
Answer me this, any of you.

1055
01:21:45,489 --> 01:21:49,017
Do you Now what it means to be given
the freedom of the city?

1056
01:21:49,093 --> 01:21:53,082
Tammy would Now, sir.
He's a scholar at Heriot's School... now.

1057
01:21:53,159 --> 01:21:55,114
It's when the queen comes, mister,

1058
01:21:55,191 --> 01:21:58,335
and you give her the keys to
the burgh gates that are not here any more.

1059
01:21:58,413 --> 01:21:59,947
Right, laddie.

1060
01:22:00,023 --> 01:22:02,439
The gates and walls are down.

1061
01:22:02,516 --> 01:22:06,926
But we still give the keys to visitors
who are grand or wise

1062
01:22:07,003 --> 01:22:08,920
or just useful out of the ordinary.

1063
01:22:08,997 --> 01:22:11,759
Like the Duke of Wellington
and Miss Florence Nightingale.

1064
01:22:11,797 --> 01:22:13,944
Yes. The brave and faithful.

1065
01:22:14,021 --> 01:22:19,198
Now, here's a wee dog
that's been faithful out of the ordinary.

1066
01:22:19,275 --> 01:22:22,764
For a dead man he loved,
he's gone hungry and been cold.

1067
01:22:22,841 --> 01:22:27,904
He has never forgotten him
or left his side by night.

1068
01:22:27,980 --> 01:22:30,204
And do the police no' have to tale him?

1069
01:22:30,281 --> 01:22:33,464
If he is made free of the city,
he can wander where he likes.

1070
01:22:33,541 --> 01:22:37,145
- What would Bobby do with keys?
- Sh!

1071
01:22:52,448 --> 01:22:57,817
"Greyfriars Bobby, from the lord provost!
Licensed."

1072
01:23:00,539 --> 01:23:05,985
Ailie, 'tis the lord provost himself,
and I called him "mister."

1073
01:23:06,982 --> 01:23:09,589
If dozens of children who Now him

1074
01:23:09,666 --> 01:23:14,077
will bring seven shillings
in farthings and pennies for him,

1075
01:23:14,115 --> 01:23:19,446
they buy the right for the dog
to live in care of them all

1076
01:23:19,523 --> 01:23:22,475
in the lirlyard of Greyfriars.

1077
01:23:24,278 --> 01:23:26,886
But he must have a collar,

1078
01:23:26,962 --> 01:23:30,338
so that all the police will Now him

1079
01:23:30,414 --> 01:23:34,364
and never tale him up
for a master less dog.

1080
01:23:35,016 --> 01:23:36,934
He belongs to all of you.

1081
01:23:38,046 --> 01:23:43,146
And all of you are responsible for him now.

1082
01:23:44,949 --> 01:23:46,866
You're free, wee man.

1083
01:23:48,553 --> 01:23:51,123
Off you go.

1084
01:23:57,681 --> 01:24:00,212
- Bobby's free!
- Bobby's free!

1085
01:24:02,705 --> 01:24:05,274
Hey, wait! Wait for me!

1086
01:24:33,576 --> 01:24:36,031
Get away, Bobby. Get away.

1087
01:24:37,833 --> 01:24:40,517
Is the wee dog the regimental mascot
there, Corporal?

1088
01:24:40,555 --> 01:24:43,355
Oh, that's Greyfriars Bobby, sir.
He belongs to the city.

1089
01:24:43,432 --> 01:24:45,848
- Have you not heard of him?
- Och, aye, of course.

1090
01:24:45,925 --> 01:24:47,536
So that's him.

1091
01:25:04,141 --> 01:25:06,672
- Hello, Bobby. How ye doin'?
- Hello, Bobby. How are ye?

1092
01:25:09,050 --> 01:25:11,887
I'm sorry the door wasn't open,
but I had my hands full.

1093
01:25:13,537 --> 01:25:15,263
Here. Come on.

1094
01:25:15,339 --> 01:25:17,678
Down here. There.

1095
01:25:22,434 --> 01:25:24,466
Good night to ye, Bobby.

1096
01:25:25,617 --> 01:25:28,723
Bobby. Almost shut ye out.

1097
01:25:29,835 --> 01:25:31,829
I must never do that again.

1098
01:25:43,948 --> 01:25:45,866
Will ye no' come in?

1099
01:25:46,825 --> 01:25:48,359
What for?

1100
01:25:48,435 --> 01:25:51,349
Ohh, to have a wee dram
with Jeanie and myself.

1101
01:25:52,884 --> 01:25:54,878
Come.

1102
01:26:06,307 --> 01:26:08,684
Good night to ye, Bobby.

1103
01:26:08,761 --> 01:26:10,678
Good night, Bobby.

1104
01:26:18,349 --> 01:26:19,806
Good night, Bobby.

1105
01:26:19,882 --> 01:26:22,566
Good night to ye, Bobby.
I'll see ye in the morning'.

1106
01:26:22,605 --> 01:26:25,213
- Good night, Bobby.
- Good night. Sleep well.

1107
01:26:25,290 --> 01:26:26,785
Be out to play with ye
in the morning'.

1108
01:26:26,862 --> 01:26:29,124
Good night, Bobby.

1109
01:26:29,163 --> 01:26:31,196
Good night to ye, laddie.

1110
01:26:34,340 --> 01:26:39,096
Good night.
Good night, dog. Good night, Bobby.
