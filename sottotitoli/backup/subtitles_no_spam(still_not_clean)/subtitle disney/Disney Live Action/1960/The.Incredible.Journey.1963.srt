1
00:02:40,424 --> 00:02:44,491
<i>It was in that time of year
called Indian summer,</i>

2
00:02:44,493 --> 00:02:47,460
<i>That season when the Canadian wilderness...</i>

3
00:02:47,462 --> 00:02:50,095
<i>Is touched with Autumn's mystery.</i>

4
00:02:50,097 --> 00:02:53,131
<i>It's a time when change is in the air,</i>

5
00:02:53,133 --> 00:02:55,233
<i>When migration is in the blood...</i>

6
00:02:55,235 --> 00:02:58,302
<i>And the homing instinct
is strong in the heart.</i>

7
00:02:58,304 --> 00:03:01,204
<i>It's a time of busy comings and goings,</i>

8
00:03:01,206 --> 00:03:05,007
<i>Of constant commotion
and unexplained restlessness.</i>

9
00:03:05,009 --> 00:03:09,111
<i>Yet, as each day ends, nature sleeps again,</i>

10
00:03:09,113 --> 00:03:12,413
<i>And the night brings a peaceful calm.</i>

11
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:16,349
<i>It was in this uncertain season,</i>

12
00:03:16,351 --> 00:03:19,352
<i>In this same wild section of Canada,</i>

13
00:03:19,354 --> 00:03:21,654
<i>That this story had its beginnings.</i>

14
00:03:23,624 --> 00:03:26,358
<i>One evening, a man named John Longridge...</i>

15
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,294
<i>Was passing the time with some old friends.</i>

16
00:03:29,296 --> 00:03:32,230
<i>They were good company, these three.</i>

17
00:03:32,232 --> 00:03:35,466
<i>For a bachelor, almost like
having a family around.</i>

18
00:03:42,641 --> 00:03:46,008
Washing will be done on the floor.

19
00:03:48,912 --> 00:03:51,579
<i>Yet, things weren't
as perfect as they seemed.</i>

20
00:03:51,581 --> 00:03:55,949
<i>It so happened, this wasn't
the animals' true home.</i>

21
00:03:55,951 --> 00:03:59,085
<i>And this man, for all
his hospitality and kindness,</i>

22
00:03:59,087 --> 00:04:01,454
<i>Wasn't their real master.</i>

23
00:04:01,456 --> 00:04:04,223
<i>And that accounted for the lonely look...</i>

24
00:04:04,225 --> 00:04:06,424
<i>In the young retriever's eyes.</i>

25
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,300
Hello.

26
00:04:19,636 --> 00:04:23,070
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.
Mrs. Oakes?

27
00:04:23,072 --> 00:04:25,639
Yes, it's me, Mr. Longridge.
Can you hear me?

28
00:04:27,175 --> 00:04:29,141
I hear you.

29
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:33,345
<i>I wanted to know what time
you'd be leaving in the morning.</i>

30
00:04:33,347 --> 00:04:35,013
<i>About seven.</i>

31
00:04:35,015 --> 00:04:38,282
<i>Trouble is, I can't make it by then.</i>

32
00:04:38,284 --> 00:04:42,285
<i>Sorry, Mrs. Oakes,
I've lost you again.</i>

33
00:04:42,287 --> 00:04:44,253
<i>I think it's somebody else on the line.</i>

34
00:04:45,589 --> 00:04:48,389
If that's you, Winifred,
you get off this minute.

35
00:04:48,391 --> 00:04:50,457
Do you hear me?

36
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:52,325
Winifred?

37
00:04:52,327 --> 00:04:55,027
<i>- You're still there.
- I can tell.</i>

38
00:04:55,029 --> 00:04:58,030
What I was trying to
tell you, Mr. Longridge,

39
00:04:58,032 --> 00:05:00,098
I can't get there until nine o'clock.

40
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,266
That's quite all right.

41
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:04,935
You're sure now?
Nine o'clock...

42
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:06,636
<i>Is all right?</i>

43
00:05:06,638 --> 00:05:09,238
Of course, and before
you get here I'll take...

44
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,573
<i>The 2 dogs and the cat...</i>

45
00:05:11,575 --> 00:05:13,341
Hello?

46
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:15,076
Hello?

47
00:05:15,078 --> 00:05:16,610
Hello?

48
00:05:16,612 --> 00:05:18,378
Mr. Longridge?

49
00:05:21,215 --> 00:05:23,848
The joys of living in the country.

50
00:05:24,517 --> 00:05:26,583
Well, that was your friend,

51
00:05:26,585 --> 00:05:28,585
<i>Mrs. Oakes.</i>

52
00:05:28,587 --> 00:05:31,854
Now, how about a run?

53
00:05:35,326 --> 00:05:37,359
Come on, you two.

54
00:05:37,361 --> 00:05:39,894
<i>For a man who'd never kept pets,</i>

55
00:05:39,896 --> 00:05:41,896
<i>Longridge had learned the ropes quickly.</i>

56
00:05:41,898 --> 00:05:44,531
<i>He knew the animals expected and enjoyed...</i>

57
00:05:44,533 --> 00:05:46,566
<i>Their nightly romp outdoors.</i>

58
00:05:56,243 --> 00:05:58,876
<i>He'd learned not to worry about them.</i>

59
00:05:58,878 --> 00:06:01,912
<i>They'd be back in their own good time.</i>

60
00:06:10,355 --> 00:06:13,222
"Dear Mrs. Oakes,"

61
00:06:13,224 --> 00:06:18,059
"we are out of coffee."

62
00:06:18,061 --> 00:06:22,062
"Please order more."

63
00:06:22,064 --> 00:06:25,432
"I'll be taking dogs..."

64
00:06:25,434 --> 00:06:29,102
"and Tao, too, of course,"

65
00:06:32,173 --> 00:06:34,173
"out for a morning run...

66
00:06:34,175 --> 00:06:36,875
"before I leave.

67
00:06:36,877 --> 00:06:41,478
"Don't worry yourself too much over them.

68
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,180
I know they
will be fine."

69
00:07:11,407 --> 00:07:13,407
No bears out tonight?

70
00:07:13,409 --> 00:07:16,376
Rabbits? Skunks?
No other cats?

71
00:07:18,446 --> 00:07:21,513
Come on, Luath.
You're letting in the cold.

72
00:07:22,616 --> 00:07:24,949
<i>At bedtime every night,</i>

73
00:07:24,951 --> 00:07:27,551
<i>The retriever liked to get off by himself,</i>

74
00:07:27,553 --> 00:07:30,253
<i>So he slept in the kitchen.</i>

75
00:07:30,255 --> 00:07:33,122
<i>The comfort-loving siamese
chose the hearth...</i>

76
00:07:33,124 --> 00:07:35,090
<i>In front of the fire.</i>

77
00:07:39,561 --> 00:07:40,826
<i>But the bull terrier wouldn't
settle for anything less...</i>

78
00:07:40,828 --> 00:07:42,894
<i>Than the master bedroom.</i>

79
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:56,440
<i>Old Bodger had his own basket,
his own blanket,</i>

80
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:59,276
<i>And his own sly plans.</i>

81
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:01,911
<i>The moment the man dropped off to sleep,</i>

82
00:08:01,913 --> 00:08:04,280
<i>The dog would sneak out of his own bed...</i>

83
00:08:04,282 --> 00:08:06,215
<i>And then climb into the big one.</i>

84
00:08:06,217 --> 00:08:09,151
<i>He practically never missed his chance.</i>

85
00:08:19,362 --> 00:08:22,162
<i>But tonight for some reason,
the man stayed awake.</i>

86
00:08:22,164 --> 00:08:24,430
<i>He was calling to mind again,</i>

87
00:08:24,432 --> 00:08:27,833
<i>How he'd come to have
3 remarkable animals...</i>

88
00:08:27,835 --> 00:08:29,901
<i>Belonging to somebody else.</i>

89
00:08:34,873 --> 00:08:38,074
<i>It was one weekend at
professor Hunter's house.</i>

90
00:08:38,076 --> 00:08:40,876
<i>The Hunters were his closest friends.</i>

91
00:08:40,878 --> 00:08:43,111
<i>He was godfather to the daughter,</i>

92
00:08:43,113 --> 00:08:45,813
<i>And sort of an unofficial uncle to the son.</i>

93
00:08:47,283 --> 00:08:50,417
<i>This, somehow, gave him a
special interest in their pets.</i>

94
00:08:50,419 --> 00:08:52,585
<i>Come on, Bodger, jump!</i>

95
00:08:53,421 --> 00:08:55,487
Get the ball!

96
00:09:01,027 --> 00:09:03,927
<i>On this Sunday, as usual,
he was invited to dinner,</i>

97
00:09:03,929 --> 00:09:07,830
<i>And this happened to be the day
the exciting telegram came.</i>

98
00:09:07,832 --> 00:09:10,833
I've been offered a visiting
fellowship at Oxford.

99
00:09:10,835 --> 00:09:12,868
Here's what they say.

100
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:21,509
"A series of 12 lectures.

101
00:09:21,511 --> 00:09:24,912
Lodging for family available.
Hope you will accept."

102
00:09:24,914 --> 00:09:27,214
It's wonderful news!

103
00:09:27,216 --> 00:09:28,915
You are going to accept?

104
00:09:28,917 --> 00:09:32,285
Well, it does mean a lot to my career...

105
00:09:32,287 --> 00:09:34,287
And Nancy's willing.

106
00:09:34,289 --> 00:09:36,555
<i>Nancy was more than willing.</i>

107
00:09:36,557 --> 00:09:40,158
<i>In fact, everybody was thrilled,</i>

108
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,427
And in their excitement had
forgotten something important.

109
00:09:43,429 --> 00:09:46,797
What will we do about Tao while we're away?

110
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:49,933
Hey, that's right.
What about Bodger?

111
00:09:49,935 --> 00:09:53,102
I must confess, this is
a problem I'd overlooked.

112
00:09:53,104 --> 00:09:57,138
Don't worry, we'll find a
good kennel and board them out.

113
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:00,341
But mother, not Tao.

114
00:10:00,343 --> 00:10:03,310
<i>You know how he hates to be cooped up.</i>

115
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:06,046
<i>He wouldn't be that cooped up.
He'd be with other cats.</i>

116
00:10:06,048 --> 00:10:08,815
<i>But he hates other cats.</i>

117
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:10,583
<i>Might do him good.</i>

118
00:10:10,584 --> 00:10:12,350
<i>Sometimes, I think, he thinks he's a dog.</i>

119
00:10:12,353 --> 00:10:14,486
Well, suppose we settle this later.

120
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:16,988
No need to bother John with the problem.

121
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:19,323
Ah, but I have the answer.

122
00:10:19,325 --> 00:10:22,959
There I am rattling around
that big house of mine, right?

123
00:10:22,961 --> 00:10:25,995
I know the animals.
The animals know me.

124
00:10:25,997 --> 00:10:28,263
So there's no need to board them out.

125
00:10:28,265 --> 00:10:31,032
<i>They will stay with me.</i>

126
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,127
<i>About the time everyone else was in bed,</i>

127
00:11:00,129 --> 00:11:03,196
<i>It was the cat's habit
to wake up and go prowling.</i>

128
00:11:05,033 --> 00:11:08,034
<i>A shadow, a moth, a beam of moonlight,</i>

129
00:11:08,036 --> 00:11:10,536
<i>His curiosity took him everywhere.</i>

130
00:11:10,538 --> 00:11:13,539
<i>On this particular night, his exploring...</i>

131
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:15,874
<i>Would sort of miscarry.</i>

132
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:19,344
<i>Without his knowing it,
he had opened the door...</i>

133
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:21,412
<i>For the incredible journey.</i>

134
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:27,784
<i>Next morning, as he'd planned,</i>

135
00:11:27,786 --> 00:11:30,287
<i>John Longridge got off to an early start.</i>

136
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:32,322
<i>For as long as he could remember,</i>

137
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:35,558
<i>He'd never missed
the opening day of duck season.</i>

138
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,626
<i>Here it was, that time of year again.</i>

139
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,499
Luath,

140
00:11:45,501 --> 00:11:47,667
<i>Young fella,</i>

141
00:11:47,669 --> 00:11:50,503
You'd like to come along,
but I'm afraid it wouldn't do.

142
00:11:50,505 --> 00:11:52,538
You couldn't leave your friends,

143
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,640
Now, could you?

144
00:11:54,642 --> 00:11:56,942
Why, Luath.

145
00:11:56,944 --> 00:11:59,945
This is the first time.

146
00:11:59,947 --> 00:12:02,213
You charmer, you.

147
00:12:06,185 --> 00:12:08,518
Well, young fella, you're the steady one,

148
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,620
So you'll look after the other two.

149
00:12:10,622 --> 00:12:12,455
<i>Won't you?</i>

150
00:12:12,457 --> 00:12:14,557
Au revoir.

151
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:41,283
<i>Now, the animals were alone,</i>

152
00:12:41,285 --> 00:12:43,952
<i>And for all they knew, completely deserted.</i>

153
00:12:43,954 --> 00:12:46,654
<i>Silence fell upon the scene,</i>

154
00:12:46,656 --> 00:12:50,357
<i>Silence that seemed to stretch
away to the ends of the earth.</i>

155
00:12:54,096 --> 00:12:56,096
<i>Then voices spoke.</i>

156
00:12:56,098 --> 00:12:58,398
<i>Wild geese called,</i>

157
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,900
<i>Wild geese going home.</i>

158
00:13:10,277 --> 00:13:14,945
<i>Somehow, this was an urge
the young dog could understand.</i>

159
00:13:14,947 --> 00:13:18,014
<i>For in him, the homing
instinct was strong, too.</i>

160
00:13:49,914 --> 00:13:54,182
<i>Among these three, the bond
of friendship was binding.</i>

161
00:13:54,184 --> 00:13:57,551
<i>Wherever one would go,
the others would follow.</i>

162
00:13:59,621 --> 00:14:01,887
<i>So it was,</i>

163
00:14:01,889 --> 00:14:04,289
<i>The animals set out for home.</i>

164
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:07,959
<i>They couldn't know it was 200 miles away.</i>

165
00:14:07,961 --> 00:14:10,895
<i>They only knew that it was
somewhere off to the west,</i>

166
00:14:10,897 --> 00:14:13,597
<i>So they would follow the sun.</i>

167
00:14:13,599 --> 00:14:16,199
<i>The incredible journey had begun.</i>

168
00:14:35,019 --> 00:14:37,352
That's funny.
I don't see the animals.

169
00:14:37,354 --> 00:14:39,954
They're always out to welcome us.

170
00:14:39,956 --> 00:14:42,489
Probably Mr. Longridge
left them inside...

171
00:14:42,491 --> 00:14:45,592
<i>Knowing you was coming.</i> I s'pose so.

172
00:14:45,594 --> 00:14:48,194
Bring the vacuum cleaner,

173
00:14:48,196 --> 00:14:50,429
<i>Will ya, Bert?</i>

174
00:14:57,604 --> 00:15:00,571
Now, where do you s'pose they've gone to?

175
00:15:00,573 --> 00:15:03,306
Bodger, Luath?

176
00:15:04,942 --> 00:15:06,975
Where could those rascals be?

177
00:15:08,211 --> 00:15:11,345
Probably gone up to the school.

178
00:15:11,347 --> 00:15:13,480
There's no note at all.

179
00:15:13,482 --> 00:15:16,216
He goes up there sometimes
to play with the kids.

180
00:15:16,218 --> 00:15:19,985
Where's the cat?
He wouldn't go up there.

181
00:15:20,454 --> 00:15:22,954
Luath, Tao?

182
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:25,056
Here puss, puss, puss.

183
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:27,624
Bodger?

184
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:29,892
Here, boy.
Here, boy!

185
00:15:31,295 --> 00:15:34,296
Luath? Tao?

186
00:15:34,298 --> 00:15:36,364
Bodger?

187
00:15:44,873 --> 00:15:47,106
They're not outside.

188
00:15:47,108 --> 00:15:49,341
Probably hunting.

189
00:15:49,343 --> 00:15:52,377
The cat, maybe. I never saw
such an animal for hunting.

190
00:15:52,379 --> 00:15:55,179
But the dogs, they wouldn't go off.

191
00:15:55,181 --> 00:15:57,481
Quit stewing.
They'll show up.

192
00:15:57,483 --> 00:15:59,449
Where do you want this plugged in?

193
00:15:59,451 --> 00:16:01,918
Right there, in front of your nose.

194
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,321
Oh, for heaven's sakes.

195
00:16:05,323 --> 00:16:09,591
Here's a note from
Mr. Longridge, after all.

196
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:11,292
That's funny.

197
00:16:11,294 --> 00:16:15,462
"I'll be taking the dogs
and Tao too, of course."

198
00:16:15,464 --> 00:16:17,997
Now what do you s'pose he means by that?

199
00:16:17,999 --> 00:16:20,899
Just what it says.
He's got the animals.

200
00:16:20,901 --> 00:16:23,034
Why didn't he say so on the phone?

201
00:16:23,036 --> 00:16:24,602
Don't ask me.

202
00:16:24,604 --> 00:16:26,570
Wait a minute.
I remember now.

203
00:16:26,572 --> 00:16:29,272
Last night when the phone went dead,

204
00:16:29,274 --> 00:16:32,308
Mr. Longridge was just about
to tell me something.

205
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:35,577
Then, don't worry. He's got
the dogs and the cat, too.

206
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:38,179
You've got nothing to fuss about.

207
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,050
Well, all I can say is that...

208
00:16:44,052 --> 00:16:47,919
It sure beats me how some people
can change their minds.

209
00:16:49,589 --> 00:16:52,189
<i>As it turned out,
not a single person concerned...</i>

210
00:16:52,191 --> 00:16:54,391
<i>Would know of the secret departure.</i>

211
00:16:54,393 --> 00:16:58,261
<i>By this time, the animals
were well on their way.</i>

212
00:17:08,906 --> 00:17:10,906
<i>From the very start,</i>

213
00:17:10,908 --> 00:17:14,042
<i>The travelers had adopted
a certain marching order.</i>

214
00:17:14,044 --> 00:17:16,511
<i>The young dog became the natural leader,</i>

215
00:17:16,513 --> 00:17:19,514
<i>For he was the one driven
by the desire to get home.</i>

216
00:17:22,886 --> 00:17:25,086
<i>The old dog was more of a follower,</i>

217
00:17:25,088 --> 00:17:28,355
<i>Quite satisfied to
let someone else show the way.</i>

218
00:17:28,357 --> 00:17:30,390
<i>He wasn't too sure he could make it,</i>

219
00:17:30,392 --> 00:17:33,159
<i>But he'd try for his friends' sake.</i>

220
00:17:33,161 --> 00:17:35,261
<i>The cat, meanwhile, was everywhere;</i>

221
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:38,530
<i>Sometimes in front, sometimes far behind,</i>

222
00:17:38,532 --> 00:17:42,033
<i>Sometimes off on side trips of his own.</i>

223
00:18:40,926 --> 00:18:43,192
<i>As the little procession went along,</i>

224
00:18:43,194 --> 00:18:45,394
<i>The dogs were the dedicated ones,</i>

225
00:18:45,396 --> 00:18:47,462
<i>And the cat
the happy-go-lucky one...</i>

226
00:18:47,464 --> 00:18:50,097
<i>Ready for anything, especially hunting.</i>

227
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:19,057
<i>Along about mid-afternoon
of that first day,</i>

228
00:19:19,059 --> 00:19:21,893
<i>The animals were getting a little tired...</i>

229
00:19:21,895 --> 00:19:23,975
<i>And beginning to feel
the effects of their long walk.</i>

230
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:31,334
<i>They put their heads together a moment,</i>

231
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:34,036
<i>And even the ambitious
young leader seemed to agree...</i>

232
00:19:34,038 --> 00:19:36,104
<i>It was time to stop.</i>

233
00:20:13,275 --> 00:20:16,376
<i>When he'd had his fill,
the retriever led off again.</i>

234
00:20:16,378 --> 00:20:19,078
<i>He took it for granted that
the rest periods would be short,</i>

235
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,347
<i>That they'd immediately push on.</i>

236
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,382
<i>It seemed, though,</i>

237
00:20:25,384 --> 00:20:28,050
<i>That his partners weren't of the same mind.</i>

238
00:20:29,286 --> 00:20:31,552
<i>Old Bodger's feet hurt.</i>

239
00:20:40,929 --> 00:20:43,162
<i>The truth of the matter was,</i>

240
00:20:43,164 --> 00:20:45,164
<i>This was almost too much for an old dog...</i>

241
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:48,133
<i>No longer in his prime.</i>

242
00:20:48,135 --> 00:20:51,369
<i>The others would just have to
wait while he took a moment out.</i>

243
00:20:51,371 --> 00:20:53,337
<i>The cat was agreeable.</i>

244
00:20:53,339 --> 00:20:55,939
<i>Especially since
he'd stumbled onto something...</i>

245
00:20:55,941 --> 00:20:58,141
<i>Well worth waiting around for.</i>

246
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:50,224
<i>Car coming!</i>

247
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:54,160
<i>Might be someone who would
recognize them, and this was...</i>

248
00:21:54,162 --> 00:21:56,896
<i>The last thing they wanted.</i>

249
00:22:18,983 --> 00:22:22,217
<i>The scare over,
it was time to get going again.</i>

250
00:22:22,219 --> 00:22:26,020
<i>If the old terrier
had been alone at this moment,</i>

251
00:22:26,022 --> 00:22:28,155
<i>He probably wouldn't have bothered.</i>

252
00:22:28,157 --> 00:22:32,859
<i>He was stiff in every joint, and
definitely feeling his years.</i>

253
00:22:32,861 --> 00:22:35,461
<i>Much more of this and he'd be through.</i>

254
00:22:40,868 --> 00:22:42,901
<i>By morning of the second day,</i>

255
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:46,437
<i>Bodger was definitely
beginning to slow down.</i>

256
00:22:46,439 --> 00:22:49,373
<i>It was becoming more and more apparent...</i>

257
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:51,808
<i>He'd soon have to rest.</i>

258
00:22:58,249 --> 00:23:02,250
<i>But the young leader
couldn't bring himself to stop,</i>

259
00:23:02,252 --> 00:23:05,186
<i>Not this early in the game,</i>

260
00:23:05,188 --> 00:23:08,222
<i>And he kept urging his friends to push on.</i>

261
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:11,424
<i>As the leader,</i>

262
00:23:11,426 --> 00:23:13,859
<i>It was the retriever's job
to choose the way.</i>

263
00:23:13,861 --> 00:23:15,894
<i>He seemed to have an uncanny knack...</i>

264
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:18,129
<i>Of always knowing where west was.</i>

265
00:23:28,941 --> 00:23:31,942
<i>So far as he was concerned,</i>

266
00:23:31,944 --> 00:23:35,512
<i>There'd be no such thing as obstacles.</i>

267
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:38,515
<i>He would keep going in a straight line.</i>

268
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:41,484
<i>It was up to the others to follow.</i>

269
00:23:55,266 --> 00:23:58,901
<i>For Bodger, it wasn't quite that simple.</i>

270
00:23:58,903 --> 00:24:02,271
<i>His sore feet were beginning
to give him real trouble,</i>

271
00:24:02,273 --> 00:24:05,474
<i>And his pace was getting slower and slower.</i>

272
00:24:35,973 --> 00:24:38,039
<i>Many miles farther on,</i>

273
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:41,042
<i>Near mid-afternoon
of the second day,</i>

274
00:24:41,044 --> 00:24:44,545
<i>The weary old terrier had
just about reached his limit.</i>

275
00:24:57,226 --> 00:25:00,493
<i>The collapse, when it came, was total.</i>

276
00:25:00,495 --> 00:25:04,063
<i>His legs simply folded up under him.</i>

277
00:25:25,552 --> 00:25:28,953
<i>The young dog hated to stop,
yet he knew he had to.</i>

278
00:25:28,955 --> 00:25:31,655
<i>He couldn't leave his friend.
There was nothing else to do...</i>

279
00:25:31,657 --> 00:25:35,325
<i>But wait until Bodger
could get his second wind.</i>

280
00:25:35,327 --> 00:25:38,895
<i>And if possible, somewhere,
somehow, something to eat.</i>

281
00:25:38,897 --> 00:25:40,963
<i>In fact, all of them were getting hungry,</i>

282
00:25:40,965 --> 00:25:42,965
<i>And before much longer,</i>

283
00:25:42,967 --> 00:25:46,101
<i>Would need something
more to go on, than water.</i>

284
00:25:47,237 --> 00:25:49,937
<i>If food was to be found,</i>

285
00:25:49,939 --> 00:25:52,606
<i>It was likely the cat
would be the first to find it.</i>

286
00:25:52,608 --> 00:25:56,142
<i>Suddenly, the chance popped up
right in front of him.</i>

287
00:26:21,268 --> 00:26:25,903
<i>Old Bodger stayed put,
glad for the chance to rest.</i>

288
00:26:25,905 --> 00:26:30,340
<i>As yet, he wasn't aware that
he was a celebrity of sorts.</i>

289
00:26:31,943 --> 00:26:34,944
<i>Somehow the news had got around about him,</i>

290
00:26:34,946 --> 00:26:37,212
<i>And now the curious came to look him over.</i>

291
00:26:55,098 --> 00:26:58,966
<i>These two decided not
to be standoffish about it,</i>

292
00:26:58,968 --> 00:27:02,069
<i>But to give him their greeting in person.</i>

293
00:27:07,976 --> 00:27:10,009
<i>Bodger, perhaps,</i>

294
00:27:10,011 --> 00:27:13,612
<i>Could have done with a little
less of the personal touch,</i>

295
00:27:13,614 --> 00:27:16,615
<i>But he was much too tired to object.</i>

296
00:27:42,142 --> 00:27:44,509
<i>Pretty soon the cubs had had enough, too.</i>

297
00:27:44,511 --> 00:27:47,111
<i>To their way of thinking,</i>

298
00:27:47,113 --> 00:27:50,013
<i>This dull stranger wasn't much for fun.</i>

299
00:27:50,949 --> 00:27:52,982
<i>In another moment,</i>

300
00:27:52,984 --> 00:27:56,485
<i>They'd invented a game
with a lot more action in it,</i>

301
00:27:56,487 --> 00:27:58,520
<i>Action...
And noise.</i>

302
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,127
<i>From a distance, it sounded
like a really vicious fight.</i>

303
00:28:10,598 --> 00:28:12,497
<i>Alarming enough to raise a mother's fears,</i>

304
00:28:12,499 --> 00:28:15,166
<i>And make her come a runnin'.</i>

305
00:28:22,207 --> 00:28:25,241
<i>Thoroughly aroused,</i>

306
00:28:25,243 --> 00:28:28,410
<i>The she-bear needed a target.
Somebody'd been hurtin' her cubs,</i>

307
00:28:28,412 --> 00:28:31,079
<i>And somebody would have
to suffer the consequences.</i>

308
00:29:44,281 --> 00:29:46,547
<i>It had been a near thing for Bodger,</i>

309
00:29:46,549 --> 00:29:49,950
<i>Weak as he was and almost helpless.</i>

310
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:52,319
<i>But now the cat would cheer him up.</i>

311
00:29:52,321 --> 00:29:55,322
<i>He would bring the meal so badly needed.</i>

312
00:30:26,588 --> 00:30:29,155
<i>Within a few minutes...</i>

313
00:30:29,157 --> 00:30:31,357
<i>The old dog was quite himself again,</i>

314
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:34,526
<i>Revived and refreshed,
and ready for the road.</i>

315
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:53,311
<i>By the end of the first week,</i>

316
00:30:53,313 --> 00:30:56,180
<i>The animals had learned
to travel after sundown.</i>

317
00:30:56,182 --> 00:30:59,149
<i>For then, they stood
less chance of being seen.</i>

318
00:30:59,151 --> 00:31:01,951
<i>Generally, they steered around settlements,</i>

319
00:31:01,953 --> 00:31:05,454
<i>But one night they decided
to break their rule.</i>

320
00:31:05,456 --> 00:31:09,157
<i>An old sawmill looked
deserted enough to risk it,</i>

321
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:11,325
<i>And they chose the shortcut.</i>

322
00:31:34,583 --> 00:31:38,184
<i>Everything went along all right...</i>

323
00:31:38,186 --> 00:31:41,987
<i>Until Bodger got wind of the cook house.</i>

324
00:32:22,458 --> 00:32:26,226
<i>Being shot at was something new
for the old terrier.</i>

325
00:32:26,228 --> 00:32:28,394
<i>It sort of shook his faith in human nature.</i>

326
00:32:28,396 --> 00:32:30,396
<i>But worse than that,</i>

327
00:32:30,398 --> 00:32:33,532
<i>It made him look foolish
in front of his friends.</i>

328
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:39,904
<i>He could sense it in their accusing looks.</i>

329
00:32:57,056 --> 00:33:00,157
<i>After 10 days on the trail,</i>

330
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:02,092
<i>The animals were weak with hunger,</i>

331
00:33:02,094 --> 00:33:04,327
<i>And had begun to get discouraged.</i>

332
00:33:04,329 --> 00:33:06,862
<i>Even the determined young leader.</i>

333
00:33:10,567 --> 00:33:12,166
<i>By now,</i>

334
00:33:12,168 --> 00:33:14,601
<i>They were ready to stalk
any wild game they could find.</i>

335
00:33:14,603 --> 00:33:18,304
<i>The cat, of course, was a natural hunter,</i>

336
00:33:18,306 --> 00:33:21,073
<i>But the dogs were ready to try, too,</i>

337
00:33:21,075 --> 00:33:23,408
<i>Though neither of them
was a true hunting breed.</i>

338
00:34:12,225 --> 00:34:16,060
<i>Chasing rabbits was a bit
strenuous for the old terrier,</i>

339
00:34:16,062 --> 00:34:18,128
<i>And instead, he rested.</i>

340
00:34:19,131 --> 00:34:22,198
<i>Then, suddenly, he heard singing.</i>

341
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,501
<i>It was old Jeremy, the hermit,</i>

342
00:34:25,503 --> 00:34:27,536
<i>Recluse, and philosopher.</i>

343
00:34:27,538 --> 00:34:30,205
<i>Slightly odd, people said,</i>

344
00:34:30,207 --> 00:34:32,173
<i>But kindly, and very friendly to animals.</i>

345
00:34:53,028 --> 00:34:56,162
Oh, ho!
Good day to you.

346
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,833
<i>Old Jeremy lived close to nature...</i>

347
00:35:01,835 --> 00:35:03,968
<i>In a world of his own.</i>

348
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:06,270
<i>His friends, the wild
creatures of the forest.</i>

349
00:35:06,272 --> 00:35:09,006
<i>Instinctively,</i>

350
00:35:09,008 --> 00:35:10,940
<i>Bodger felt this was a man
who might help them.</i>

351
00:35:25,486 --> 00:35:27,919
<i>When the retriever returned
and fell in step,</i>

352
00:35:27,921 --> 00:35:30,421
<i>He was sort of lukewarm about it.</i>

353
00:35:30,423 --> 00:35:33,891
<i>This was all against his better judgment.</i>

354
00:35:33,893 --> 00:35:36,326
<i>He wasn't sure...</i>

355
00:35:36,328 --> 00:35:39,028
<i>They wanted to get
mixed-up with people.</i>

356
00:35:56,546 --> 00:35:59,446
<i>At the hermit's cabin
the young dog hung back,</i>

357
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:02,248
<i>Still not convinced this was a good idea.</i>

358
00:36:20,501 --> 00:36:24,002
Come in, my dear, around this way.

359
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:34,045
Presently, maud, presently.

360
00:36:44,489 --> 00:36:47,156
<i>It was the appetizing smell of the stew...</i>

361
00:36:47,158 --> 00:36:49,091
<i>That finally won the dog over.</i>

362
00:36:49,093 --> 00:36:51,059
<i>However, he would put his rabbit...</i>

363
00:36:51,061 --> 00:36:53,227
<i>Where he could find it later.</i>

364
00:37:09,244 --> 00:37:12,377
Oh, come in, old chap.
Glad to have you aboard.

365
00:37:13,847 --> 00:37:16,380
<i>So the retriever joined his friends,</i>

366
00:37:16,382 --> 00:37:19,082
<i>Prepared to accept
the old man's hospitality.</i>

367
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:23,385
<i>Now, their host went about
setting the table.</i>

368
00:37:27,423 --> 00:37:30,123
<i>From long habit, he got out only one plate.</i>

369
00:37:30,125 --> 00:37:31,824
<i>But wait,</i>

370
00:37:31,826 --> 00:37:35,093
<i>Today there would be places for 3 more.</i>

371
00:37:40,365 --> 00:37:44,166
Oh, Maud, you must learn
to control yourself.

372
00:37:57,413 --> 00:38:00,147
<i>At last,
the half-starved animals...</i>

373
00:38:00,149 --> 00:38:03,316
<i>Were about to enjoy
a home-cooked meal.</i>

374
00:38:03,318 --> 00:38:07,453
<i>How lucky that Bodger had
spied this friendly old hermit,</i>

375
00:38:07,455 --> 00:38:12,090
<i>And how kind of him to bring
them to his bountiful table.</i>

376
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:30,173
For what we are about to receive,

377
00:38:30,175 --> 00:38:34,343
May the lord make us
truly thankful. Amen.

378
00:38:41,918 --> 00:38:43,951
Do sit down.

379
00:38:43,953 --> 00:38:46,553
<i>At the familiar command, the animals sat...</i>

380
00:38:46,555 --> 00:38:48,154
<i>On the floor,</i>

381
00:38:48,156 --> 00:38:50,489
<i>Where most pets have been trained to sit.</i>

382
00:38:50,491 --> 00:38:52,891
<i>All except cats.</i>

383
00:38:52,893 --> 00:38:56,194
<i>Cats, of course, will sit where they please.</i>

384
00:39:38,401 --> 00:39:40,334
Oh, not hungry?

385
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:41,935
<i>Oh, picky.</i>

386
00:39:48,242 --> 00:39:50,208
<i>His own plate finished,</i>

387
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:53,344
<i>The old man moved to the
next chair and the next serving.</i>

388
00:39:53,346 --> 00:39:56,213
<i>Since no one was eating it,</i>

389
00:39:56,215 --> 00:39:58,615
<i>This seemed the most logical thing to do.</i>

390
00:40:16,934 --> 00:40:19,567
<i>Gradually, it began to dawn on the dogs...</i>

391
00:40:19,569 --> 00:40:22,436
<i>That they might be about to
lose out on a good thing.</i>

392
00:40:29,945 --> 00:40:32,378
<i>The last chair, the last plate,</i>

393
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:34,546
<i>Their last chance.</i>

394
00:40:48,393 --> 00:40:50,559
<i>In the end, it was the crow...</i>

395
00:40:50,561 --> 00:40:53,161
<i>That roused the old man
from his daydreaming.</i>

396
00:40:53,163 --> 00:40:55,596
Oh, Maud,

397
00:40:55,598 --> 00:40:57,397
Time for our nap, is it?

398
00:40:59,467 --> 00:41:03,201
Good-bye, old chap.
Nice you could come to dine.

399
00:41:04,337 --> 00:41:08,138
Remember me most kindly to your mother.

400
00:41:09,207 --> 00:41:11,373
<i>Disappointed, but too polite to show it,</i>

401
00:41:11,375 --> 00:41:14,376
<i>The animals carried out
their part of the make-believe,</i>

402
00:41:14,378 --> 00:41:17,011
<i>And took themselves off,</i>

403
00:41:17,013 --> 00:41:19,013
<i>Like the well-behaved
guests they were.</i>

404
00:41:30,057 --> 00:41:32,957
Delightful people, eh, Maud?

405
00:41:32,959 --> 00:41:35,526
We must have them over again very soon.

406
00:41:35,528 --> 00:41:37,261
Yes.

407
00:41:46,205 --> 00:41:49,072
<i>As it worked out, their luck wasn't all bad.</i>

408
00:41:49,074 --> 00:41:51,074
<i>This rabbit
wasn't make-believe,</i>

409
00:41:51,076 --> 00:41:53,543
<i>So they wouldn't starve.</i>

410
00:42:34,485 --> 00:42:37,185
<i>It was to be expected
that the wilderness, itself,</i>

411
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:39,320
<i>Would give them a problem or two.</i>

412
00:42:39,322 --> 00:42:41,622
<i>Now they had one.</i>

413
00:42:47,228 --> 00:42:49,228
<i>At moments like this,</i>

414
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:53,231
<i>The retriever had a decided
advantage over his friends.</i>

415
00:42:56,069 --> 00:42:59,003
<i>For him, being an
out-and-out water dog,</i>

416
00:42:59,005 --> 00:43:01,271
<i>Crossing a river was nothing.</i>

417
00:43:01,273 --> 00:43:03,539
<i>In fact, he sort of enjoyed a nice swim.</i>

418
00:43:14,952 --> 00:43:18,987
<i>The bull terrier didn't
take to it quite so naturally.</i>

419
00:43:27,963 --> 00:43:29,963
<i>Still, once he got over his fear,</i>

420
00:43:29,965 --> 00:43:31,998
<i>He turned out to be...</i>

421
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,367
<i>A pretty good water dog, too.</i>

422
00:43:38,539 --> 00:43:42,541
<i>But when it came the cat's turn,
it was a different proposition.</i>

423
00:43:48,281 --> 00:43:50,314
<i>For the first time on the trip,</i>

424
00:43:50,316 --> 00:43:53,016
<i>He got his back up.
He wouldn't even dip his toe in.</i>

425
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:01,490
<i>He could face a bear, maybe,</i>

426
00:44:01,492 --> 00:44:03,925
<i>But he couldn't bring
himself to face a river.</i>

427
00:44:03,927 --> 00:44:05,893
<i>This was asking too much.</i>

428
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:37,320
<i>As it turned out,</i>

429
00:44:37,322 --> 00:44:39,922
<i>The cat wouldn't have to
get his feet wet, after all.</i>

430
00:44:39,924 --> 00:44:42,391
<i>There was a bridge the beavers had built.</i>

431
00:44:47,564 --> 00:44:49,564
<i>It had a stick or two missing,</i>

432
00:44:49,566 --> 00:44:52,466
<i>But not so much but what
the cat couldn't jump over.</i>

433
00:44:52,468 --> 00:44:54,935
<i>He'd crossed many a creek wider than this,</i>

434
00:44:54,937 --> 00:44:58,538
<i>And the dogs were confident he could do it.</i>

435
00:46:58,085 --> 00:47:00,485
<i>The cat was gone, no two ways about it.</i>

436
00:47:00,487 --> 00:47:03,154
<i>Their friend had disappeared.</i>

437
00:47:03,156 --> 00:47:06,423
<i>Instinctively, the dogs
knew a sense of loss.</i>

438
00:47:06,425 --> 00:47:09,826
<i>They missed their partner,
missed him very much.</i>

439
00:47:09,828 --> 00:47:13,496
<i>They tried to console each other
in their common sorrow.</i>

440
00:47:15,266 --> 00:47:17,532
<i>For hours afterward, they stood by...</i>

441
00:47:17,534 --> 00:47:19,834
<i>Refusing to leave.</i>

442
00:47:19,836 --> 00:47:23,103
<i>They seemed to feel that
somehow, by hook or crook,</i>

443
00:47:23,105 --> 00:47:26,506
<i>The clever cat would find a way to get back.</i>

444
00:47:26,508 --> 00:47:28,508
<i>If they'd stay just a little longer,</i>

445
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:30,510
<i>They'd see him comin' along...</i>

446
00:47:30,512 --> 00:47:32,979
<i>As sleek and spry as ever.</i>

447
00:47:40,387 --> 00:47:43,087
<i>But it was a forlorn hope,</i>

448
00:47:43,089 --> 00:47:45,255
<i>And finally, they seemed to understand that.</i>

449
00:47:46,558 --> 00:47:49,959
<i>Now they'd have to forget
their best friend and provider,</i>

450
00:47:49,961 --> 00:47:53,095
<i>And push on, just the two of them.</i>

451
00:47:58,568 --> 00:48:03,136
<i>Miles downstream, pure chance
would play a part in things.</i>

452
00:48:03,138 --> 00:48:05,171
<i>For in the cat's moment of greatest need,</i>

453
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:08,307
<i>A helping hand happened to be near.</i>

454
00:48:13,313 --> 00:48:15,246
Papa!

455
00:48:19,051 --> 00:48:20,984
Come and see.

456
00:48:20,986 --> 00:48:23,119
<i>There's a funny looking animal.</i>

457
00:48:34,264 --> 00:48:36,297
See, papa?

458
00:48:36,299 --> 00:48:38,232
<i>Is it a weasel?</i>

459
00:48:41,570 --> 00:48:44,404
No, I don't think so.

460
00:48:56,217 --> 00:48:58,250
No, it's a cat.

461
00:48:58,252 --> 00:49:01,386
Or...
It was a cat.

462
00:49:09,895 --> 00:49:12,362
It's moving.
It's still alive.

463
00:49:12,364 --> 00:49:14,197
Poor thing.

464
00:49:14,199 --> 00:49:16,332
What can we do?

465
00:49:16,334 --> 00:49:18,300
I don't know.

466
00:49:18,302 --> 00:49:20,335
Helvi, you run and get a dry towel,

467
00:49:20,337 --> 00:49:22,403
And I'll heat some milk.

468
00:49:23,272 --> 00:49:25,905
Put some brandy in it, too.

469
00:49:27,508 --> 00:49:30,909
Be careful.
Don't squeeze too hard.

470
00:49:30,911 --> 00:49:32,911
He swallowed half the river.

471
00:49:32,913 --> 00:49:35,280
That poor thing won't
need a drink for weeks.

472
00:49:35,282 --> 00:49:38,383
Olga, see if he'll take
a little milk and brandy.

473
00:49:43,256 --> 00:49:46,223
Oh, look.
He's moving.

474
00:49:49,794 --> 00:49:52,961
Keep him warm and quiet for awhile.

475
00:49:52,963 --> 00:49:55,330
I've got chores to do.

476
00:49:56,499 --> 00:49:58,866
Will he be all right, papa?

477
00:49:58,868 --> 00:50:02,903
Maybe, maybe not.
Hard to tell just yet.

478
00:50:07,909 --> 00:50:11,143
<i>And so it was,
that a half-starved cat...</i>

479
00:50:11,145 --> 00:50:13,545
<i>And a lonely little girl
struck up an acquaintance...</i>

480
00:50:13,547 --> 00:50:16,915
<i>That brought comfort
and companionship to both.</i>

481
00:50:43,309 --> 00:50:45,309
Good night, mama.

482
00:50:45,311 --> 00:50:48,078
Sleep well.
You, too.

483
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:50,580
Papa, one little song...

484
00:50:50,582 --> 00:50:53,149

<i>As though to tell her something.</i>

495
00:51:55,672 --> 00:51:58,439
<i>He was trying
to say good-bye.</i>

496
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:08,047
<i>Something out there was calling him,</i>

497
00:52:08,049 --> 00:52:09,982
<i>And he knew what it was.</i>

498
00:52:09,984 --> 00:52:13,185
<i>He knew he must find the 2 dogs.</i>

499
00:52:26,065 --> 00:52:28,465
<i>Next morning, the cat located the place...</i>

500
00:52:28,467 --> 00:52:31,067
<i>Where the dogs had waited,</i>

501
00:52:31,069 --> 00:52:33,969
<i>And soon had picked up their trail.</i>

502
00:52:35,639 --> 00:52:38,072
<i>Now that he was alone, he could travel...</i>

503
00:52:38,074 --> 00:52:40,140
<i>At his own pace, in his own way,</i>

504
00:52:40,142 --> 00:52:43,509
<i>His natural stealth his protection.</i>

505
00:52:44,979 --> 00:52:47,546
<i>He was almost as much
at home in the wilderness...</i>

506
00:52:47,548 --> 00:52:49,648
<i>As the creatures of the wild themselves,</i>

507
00:52:49,650 --> 00:52:51,983
<i>And often watched them pass...</i>

508
00:52:51,985 --> 00:52:54,452
<i>Without their knowing he was anywhere near.</i>

509
00:53:23,881 --> 00:53:26,982
<i>As he went deeper and deeper
into the forest,</i>

510
00:53:26,984 --> 00:53:30,251
<i>The cat began to get uneasy.
He had a strange feeling...</i>

511
00:53:30,253 --> 00:53:32,319
<i>He was being followed.</i>

512
00:53:32,321 --> 00:53:34,321
<i>There was nothing in sight,</i>

513
00:53:34,323 --> 00:53:38,157
<i>Yet his senses told him
there was something back there,</i>

514
00:53:38,159 --> 00:53:40,192
<i>Something evil.</i>

515
00:53:48,634 --> 00:53:53,002
<i>Evil it was, for it was the lynx,</i>

516
00:53:53,004 --> 00:53:55,270
<i>A wild and wanton killer.</i>

517
00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:17,450
<i>Suddenly, another hunter appeared.</i>

518
00:55:17,452 --> 00:55:20,986
<i>Not as savage as the lynx, perhaps,</i>

519
00:55:20,988 --> 00:55:23,521
<i>But equipped to deal out death,
just the same.</i>

520
00:55:43,109 --> 00:55:45,609
<i>When all seemed quiet, the cat went on.</i>

521
00:55:45,611 --> 00:55:49,079
<i>Faster now, to make up
for the time he'd lost.</i>

522
00:55:54,919 --> 00:55:57,352
<i>One morning, not long after,</i>

523
00:55:57,354 --> 00:56:00,088
<i>The dogs heard a peculiar call.</i>

524
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:04,124
<i>It was a cry to stop them in their tracks,</i>

525
00:56:04,126 --> 00:56:07,360
<i>For it sounded like a siamese cat.</i>

526
00:56:37,221 --> 00:56:41,355
<i>The young dog let Bodger
be the first to greet the cat.</i>

527
00:56:41,357 --> 00:56:43,357
<i>He understood that there was...</i>

528
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:45,625
<i>Something special about this friendship.</i>

529
00:56:48,629 --> 00:56:51,396
<i>Then both dogs offered the cat
their affection.</i>

530
00:56:51,398 --> 00:56:55,266
<i>They seemed to want to tell him
how much they'd missed him.</i>

531
00:57:07,513 --> 00:57:10,447
<i>Every step of the way,
the animals had known hunger,</i>

532
00:57:10,449 --> 00:57:13,283
<i>And by the end of the third week...</i>

533
00:57:13,285 --> 00:57:17,319
<i>Were desperate for food.</i>

534
00:57:17,321 --> 00:57:19,888
<i>By this time, they'd taught themselves...</i>

535
00:57:19,890 --> 00:57:21,990
<i>To chase anything that moved.</i>

536
00:57:21,992 --> 00:57:25,927
<i>Especially if it looked
fat and easy to catch.</i>

537
00:57:27,964 --> 00:57:30,597
<i>Now, a porcupine could only mean trouble,</i>

538
00:57:30,599 --> 00:57:34,500
<i>But the dogs weren't
experienced enough to know that.</i>

539
00:58:00,892 --> 00:58:04,059
<i>The retriever was struck...</i>

540
00:58:04,061 --> 00:58:06,861
<i>Before he quite knew what had happened.</i>

541
00:58:10,533 --> 00:58:12,533
<i>Something else he didn't know...</i>

542
00:58:12,535 --> 00:58:15,435
<i>Was that the sharp quills
were barbed like fishhooks,</i>

543
00:58:15,437 --> 00:58:17,570
<i>And would work their way in deeper.</i>

544
00:58:27,514 --> 00:58:30,248
<i>Instinctively,</i>

545
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:33,517
<i>The retriever turned to
his friends for help,</i>

546
00:58:33,519 --> 00:58:36,253
<i>But Bodger, not knowing what to do,</i>

547
00:58:36,255 --> 00:58:39,221
<i>Only succeeded in making things worse.</i>

548
00:58:41,024 --> 00:58:43,224
<i>When the pain started,</i>

549
00:58:43,226 --> 00:58:45,960
<i>The dog went to water
to cool his burning face.</i>

550
00:58:45,962 --> 00:58:49,063
<i>It wasn't a cure, but it was a relief.</i>

551
00:58:49,065 --> 00:58:52,099
<i>It was the only thing he knew to do.</i>

552
00:58:59,207 --> 00:59:00,906
<i>Every few hours,</i>

553
00:59:00,908 --> 00:59:03,541
<i>He found it necessary
to repeat the treatment.</i>

554
00:59:03,543 --> 00:59:07,411
<i>And so it was, that he happened
to be at a nearby lake...</i>

555
00:59:07,413 --> 00:59:09,446
<i>When the first flight of mallards came in.</i>

556
00:59:28,399 --> 00:59:32,567
<i>Surprised though he was,
the hunter was interested, too,</i>

557
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:36,370
<i>For he could see that the
retriever had been well trained.</i>

558
00:59:39,108 --> 00:59:43,409
<i>He was james mackenzie,
fancier of fine hunting dogs...</i>

559
00:59:43,411 --> 00:59:46,511
<i>And a man to admire one when he saw it.</i>

560
00:59:47,981 --> 00:59:50,982
Good dog!
Well done.

561
00:59:50,984 --> 00:59:53,050
Now bring it to me.

562
01:00:04,362 --> 01:00:05,928
Poor laddie.

563
01:00:05,930 --> 01:00:08,530
You've got mixed-up with
a porcupine someplace.

564
01:00:09,866 --> 01:00:13,099
Where's your master?
Ahoy!

565
01:00:15,236 --> 01:00:17,169
Or don't you have one?

566
01:00:22,041 --> 01:00:25,409
<i>Whose ever dog it was,
Mackenzie's mind was made up.</i>

567
01:00:25,411 --> 01:00:28,578
<i>The animal must have immediate attention.</i>

568
01:00:28,580 --> 01:00:32,048
<i>The retriever went along without protest.</i>

569
01:00:32,050 --> 01:00:34,050
<i>He seemed to realize...</i>

570
01:00:34,052 --> 01:00:36,018
<i>He needed help,</i>

571
01:00:36,020 --> 01:00:39,420
<i>And must return to the world
of humans to find it.</i>

572
01:00:42,024 --> 01:00:44,924
<i>And so, the kindly man led the dog home.</i>

573
01:00:44,926 --> 01:00:48,327
<i>He couldn't know there were
others of the party around,</i>

574
01:00:48,329 --> 01:00:50,962
<i>That he might even have touched one...</i>

575
01:00:50,964 --> 01:00:52,996
<i>If he'd known he was there.</i>

576
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:58,366
Nell, look what I found.

577
01:01:00,203 --> 01:01:02,769
And look what I found.

578
01:01:05,573 --> 01:01:07,839
Another one.

579
01:01:09,075 --> 01:01:11,341
This poor dog's nearly starving.

580
01:01:11,343 --> 01:01:14,243
Aye, so is this one.

581
01:01:14,245 --> 01:01:17,379
<i>Worse than that, he's hurt.</i> Hurt?

582
01:01:17,381 --> 01:01:19,848
Porcupine quills.

583
01:01:20,584 --> 01:01:24,085
You can see for yourself.

584
01:01:24,087 --> 01:01:26,487
Will he let you touch him? I think so.

585
01:01:26,489 --> 01:01:29,389
That is if his partner, here, will let me.

586
01:01:29,391 --> 01:01:32,525
Funny, how they seem to know each other.

587
01:01:32,527 --> 01:01:35,227
It's more than that. I think
they're traveling together.

588
01:01:35,229 --> 01:01:37,963
Where do you suppose they came from?

589
01:01:37,965 --> 01:01:40,432
I don't know.

590
01:01:40,434 --> 01:01:43,001
Lost from a car
traveling cross-country,

591
01:01:43,003 --> 01:01:46,104
It's hard to say.
The main thing is...

592
01:01:46,106 --> 01:01:50,174
This retriever needs help.
When did you find Whitey?

593
01:01:50,176 --> 01:01:52,576
Oh, he found me.

594
01:01:52,578 --> 01:01:54,077
I guess he smelled the bacon cooking.

595
01:01:54,079 --> 01:01:56,212
<i>He came to the door
like an old hobo, begging,</i>

596
01:01:56,214 --> 01:01:58,247
And I really mean begging.

597
01:01:58,249 --> 01:02:01,483
I heard this scratching,
and there he was carrying on...

598
01:02:01,485 --> 01:02:03,852
<i>Just like he's doing now.</i>

599
01:02:07,324 --> 01:02:09,490
You old clown.

600
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:21,068
Now, laddie, hold still.

601
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:23,637
I know this hurts.

602
01:02:23,639 --> 01:02:26,640
<i>Unfortunately, it's got to be done.</i>

603
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:36,347
There, there, laddie.
It's not as bad as all that.

604
01:02:36,349 --> 01:02:39,049
See if you can get him on the porch.

605
01:02:39,051 --> 01:02:41,985
How?
Food, food.

606
01:02:48,426 --> 01:02:52,127
Your intentions are good,
but you're getting in the way.

607
01:03:21,054 --> 01:03:23,054
Shall I go out there with him?

608
01:03:23,056 --> 01:03:25,122
No.

609
01:03:46,144 --> 01:03:48,944
There, I'm through.

610
01:03:48,946 --> 01:03:51,012
Let the other one in.

611
01:03:55,384 --> 01:03:58,551
I can't get over
the affection these two show.

612
01:03:58,553 --> 01:04:01,186
Do you think we can find who they belong to?

613
01:04:01,188 --> 01:04:03,454
When I drive into deepwater in the morning,

614
01:04:03,456 --> 01:04:06,222
I'll inquire around,
maybe put an ad in the paper.

615
01:04:07,892 --> 01:04:09,892
<i>Meanwhile,</i>

616
01:04:09,894 --> 01:04:13,228
<i>The one person who should have
been the first to know,</i>

617
01:04:13,230 --> 01:04:15,196
<i>Would be the last to hear...</i>

618
01:04:15,198 --> 01:04:18,966
<i>Of the events of the past several weeks.</i>

619
01:04:21,070 --> 01:04:23,136
Welcome back,
Mr. Longridge.

620
01:04:23,138 --> 01:04:24,904
Thank you.

621
01:04:24,906 --> 01:04:27,306
I've been watching out for you all morning.

622
01:04:27,308 --> 01:04:30,475
This came the first of the week.
The hunter family...

623
01:04:30,477 --> 01:04:34,111
Will be flying back the day
after tomorrow. So I see.

624
01:04:34,113 --> 01:04:36,113
Was it a good trip? Yes, marvelous.

625
01:04:36,115 --> 01:04:39,182
And the animals, did they have a good time?

626
01:04:39,184 --> 01:04:41,450
The animals?

627
01:04:41,452 --> 01:04:44,453
Why Bodger, and the cat and Luath.

628
01:04:44,455 --> 01:04:46,455
You mean, all this time...

629
01:04:46,457 --> 01:04:48,490
They haven't been with you?

630
01:04:48,492 --> 01:04:51,059
Of course not. I left them here.
But they're not here!

631
01:04:51,061 --> 01:04:53,194
I haven't seen them in 3 weeks.

632
01:04:53,196 --> 01:04:55,162
3 weeks?

633
01:04:55,164 --> 01:04:57,998
When I came, the morning you left,

634
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,233
The animals were nowhere in sight.

635
01:05:00,235 --> 01:05:02,235
And then, I found this note,

636
01:05:02,237 --> 01:05:05,036
Saying that you were taking them with you.

637
01:05:06,539 --> 01:05:09,139
But this is only half of it!

638
01:05:19,217 --> 01:05:22,384
That's all there was,
Mr. Longridge.

639
01:05:22,386 --> 01:05:25,286
Do you suppose they could
have been hit by a car?

640
01:05:25,288 --> 01:05:28,222
Or poisoned?
Or stolen?

641
01:05:28,224 --> 01:05:30,591
One of them, maybe,

642
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:34,094
But not all 3 together.

643
01:05:34,096 --> 01:05:37,263
Yet, they couldn't just vanish.

644
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:42,000
The retriever,

645
01:05:42,002 --> 01:05:45,069
I keep remembering the look in his eyes.

646
01:05:45,071 --> 01:05:48,205
You know,

647
01:05:48,207 --> 01:05:50,373
On the morning I left,

648
01:05:50,375 --> 01:05:53,943
For the very first time,
he offered me his paw.

649
01:05:57,081 --> 01:05:59,481
Mrs. Oakes,
they've gone home.

650
01:05:59,483 --> 01:06:01,282
Home?
Home!

651
01:06:01,284 --> 01:06:03,417
The retriever has taken them home.

652
01:06:03,419 --> 01:06:05,485
He was the unhappy one,

653
01:06:05,487 --> 01:06:07,487
So he's simply gone back home.

654
01:06:07,489 --> 01:06:11,224
Someone would have seen them.
Not necessarily.

655
01:06:11,226 --> 01:06:14,460
They wouldn't be where
anyone would see them.

656
01:06:14,462 --> 01:06:16,628
You see, traveling by instinct,

657
01:06:16,630 --> 01:06:18,630
They'd simply go west,

658
01:06:18,632 --> 01:06:20,632
Straight across country...

659
01:06:20,634 --> 01:06:23,067
And over the Ironmouth Range.

660
01:06:23,069 --> 01:06:25,069
Over the Ironmouth!

661
01:06:25,071 --> 01:06:28,405
Then there's no use hoping anymore.

662
01:06:28,407 --> 01:06:30,607
Don't let's fool ourselves.

663
01:06:30,609 --> 01:06:34,477
You know old Bodger couldn't
last more than 10 miles.

664
01:06:34,479 --> 01:06:37,345
I wouldn't give much for
the cat's chances, either.

665
01:06:39,615 --> 01:06:41,081
Operator?

666
01:06:41,083 --> 01:06:43,550
If they did make for home,
there's a good chance...

667
01:06:43,552 --> 01:06:46,085
That the big powerful dog,
like the retriever,

668
01:06:46,087 --> 01:06:47,352
<i>Would get there.</i>

669
01:06:47,354 --> 01:06:49,954
But it's a long way,
Mr. Longridge.

670
01:06:49,956 --> 01:06:53,290
Yes, I know.

671
01:06:53,292 --> 01:06:56,960
Operator, would you please
get me the chief ranger...

672
01:06:56,962 --> 01:07:00,330
Of lands and forests
up at the Ironmouth station?

673
01:07:04,068 --> 01:07:06,134
Glad to,
Mr. Longridge.

674
01:07:06,136 --> 01:07:09,837
I'll pass the word on to
the game wardens tomorrow.

675
01:07:09,839 --> 01:07:11,338
Yes, sir.

676
01:07:11,340 --> 01:07:15,041
No trouble at all,
Mr. Longridge,

677
01:07:15,043 --> 01:07:17,410
But the reporter that knows that area...

678
01:07:17,412 --> 01:07:21,380
Is up at Windigo covering a plowing contest.

679
01:07:21,382 --> 01:07:25,383
But he'll be in tomorrow,
and I'll have him call you.

680
01:07:25,385 --> 01:07:27,251
Yes, Mr. Longridge,

681
01:07:27,253 --> 01:07:29,486
I have maintenance crews
all through that country.

682
01:07:29,488 --> 01:07:32,222
I'll be in touch with them in the morning.

683
01:07:32,224 --> 01:07:35,991
Tomorrow, tomorrow.

684
01:07:35,993 --> 01:07:38,259
I gotta know today.

685
01:07:38,261 --> 01:07:40,261
How do you find a dog...

686
01:07:40,263 --> 01:07:43,297
In 200 miles of backwoods country?

687
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:46,532
<i>That same evening,</i>

688
01:07:46,534 --> 01:07:49,468
<i>James Mackenzie was providing
bed-and-board for his guests.</i>

689
01:07:49,470 --> 01:07:52,137
<i>He'd decided to keep the dogs
locked up until he could...</i>

690
01:07:52,139 --> 01:07:55,406
<i>Inquire around and find out
who they belonged to.</i>

691
01:08:01,413 --> 01:08:03,312
There you are, now.

692
01:08:03,314 --> 01:08:06,281
Spend a quiet night.

693
01:08:29,005 --> 01:08:32,039
<i>The third member of the party,</i>

694
01:08:32,041 --> 01:08:34,074
<i>Whose presence Mackenzie
was still unaware of,</i>

695
01:08:34,076 --> 01:08:36,943
<i>Had watched these goings-on
with great interest.</i>

696
01:08:36,945 --> 01:08:39,011
<i>He now knew where the dogs were.</i>

697
01:08:39,013 --> 01:08:41,179
<i>He knew they were all alone.</i>

698
01:08:41,181 --> 01:08:43,614
<i>This was his chance to join them.</i>

699
01:09:18,951 --> 01:09:22,852
<i>Neither latch nor lock could
keep him from his friends.</i>

700
01:09:26,824 --> 01:09:29,357
The worst thing is,
we haven't got a single clue.

701
01:09:33,561 --> 01:09:35,027
Hello.

702
01:09:35,029 --> 01:09:37,929
Yes, this is John Longridge.

703
01:09:39,065 --> 01:09:41,398
Yes!
Yes, that's right.

704
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:44,467
<i>2 dogs and a siamese cat.</i>

705
01:09:44,469 --> 01:09:47,436
It's the operator at Lintola.

706
01:09:47,438 --> 01:09:49,538
<i>She says a little girl
rescued a siamese cat.</i>

707
01:09:49,540 --> 01:09:53,107
Oh, it disappeared.

708
01:09:55,244 --> 01:09:57,978
2 weeks ago.
Get me the map.

709
01:09:57,980 --> 01:10:00,880
<i>No sign of the dogs?</i>

710
01:10:02,149 --> 01:10:04,516
Well, thank you very much for calling.

711
01:10:04,518 --> 01:10:07,151
Please let me know
if you hear anything more.

712
01:10:07,153 --> 01:10:11,822
Good night.
It's not much to go on,

713
01:10:11,824 --> 01:10:14,558
But apparently the cat
got as far as Lintola.

714
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:17,060
<i>It's about 100 miles from here.</i>

715
01:10:17,062 --> 01:10:19,462
100 miles? There it is, right there.

716
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:24,399
Lintola.

717
01:10:24,401 --> 01:10:26,968
How could the cat get that far,

718
01:10:26,970 --> 01:10:28,970
And nobody's seen the dogs?

719
01:10:28,972 --> 01:10:30,972
If it was our cat.

720
01:10:32,008 --> 01:10:34,908
What could have happened to those dogs?

721
01:10:37,012 --> 01:10:39,812
Poor old Bodger.

722
01:10:41,515 --> 01:10:44,949
I don't think we're going to
solve anything more tonight.

723
01:10:44,951 --> 01:10:47,451
Come on, mother.
We'd better get home,

724
01:10:47,453 --> 01:10:49,820
And let Mr. Longridge
get some sleep.

725
01:10:49,822 --> 01:10:51,588
He's gotta be on that plane in the morning.

726
01:10:51,590 --> 01:10:54,958
Yes.

727
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:57,093
When the hunters get home,
I've got to be there.

728
01:10:57,095 --> 01:10:59,895
That's the least I can do.

729
01:10:59,897 --> 01:11:03,832
But I don't know how I'm going
to face up to the children.

730
01:11:09,005 --> 01:11:10,904
<i>At sun-up
the next morning,</i>

731
01:11:10,906 --> 01:11:13,373
<i>The retriever was eager to be up and doing.</i>

732
01:11:13,375 --> 01:11:16,409
<i>The old restlessness had returned.</i>

733
01:11:16,411 --> 01:11:19,345
<i>It was time to press on.</i>

734
01:11:27,988 --> 01:11:29,954
<i>For a moment,</i>

735
01:11:29,956 --> 01:11:32,456
<i>His determination seemed to weaken.</i>

736
01:11:32,458 --> 01:11:36,359
<i>He was grateful for the kind
treatment he had received.</i>

737
01:11:36,361 --> 01:11:39,995
<i>Yet, the homing call
was stronger than gratitude,</i>

738
01:11:39,997 --> 01:11:42,130
<i>And he knew he must answer it.</i>

739
01:11:52,241 --> 01:11:54,574
<i>Ahead lay the Ironmouth Range,</i>

740
01:11:54,576 --> 01:11:57,411
<i>Rugged, forbidding, and uninhabited.</i>

741
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:04,017
<i>Now, the animals were beyond all human help.</i>

742
01:12:04,019 --> 01:12:06,085
<i>And worst of all,</i>

743
01:12:06,087 --> 01:12:09,020
<i>A biting edge of cold
could be felt in the air.</i>

744
01:12:11,157 --> 01:12:14,591
<i>Already ice had begun to form in the stream.</i>

745
01:12:14,593 --> 01:12:18,894
<i>Before many more days, the
river's voice would be still,</i>

746
01:12:18,896 --> 01:12:22,530
<i>And this land frozen under winter snows.</i>

747
01:13:29,397 --> 01:13:32,131
<i>At the hunter's house, meanwhile,</i>

748
01:13:32,133 --> 01:13:35,534
<i>The telephone had been
kept busy day and night.</i>

749
01:13:35,536 --> 01:13:38,904
Thank you for calling.
Good night.

750
01:13:38,906 --> 01:13:41,139
That's the best bet, yet.

751
01:13:41,141 --> 01:13:44,175
A man named Mackenzie, who lives in Conrad,

752
01:13:44,177 --> 01:13:47,511
Says he actually had
the dogs only 3 days ago.

753
01:13:47,513 --> 01:13:49,379
<i>Had</i> the dogs?

754
01:13:49,381 --> 01:13:51,381
Yeah. He didn't
know about the cat,

755
01:13:51,383 --> 01:13:53,416
But the dogs answer our description.

756
01:13:53,418 --> 01:13:55,418
Why didn't he keep them?

757
01:13:55,420 --> 01:13:57,653
He must have known
they belonged to somebody.

758
01:13:57,655 --> 01:14:00,055
He did. He locked
them in his barn,

759
01:14:00,057 --> 01:14:02,057
But they managed to get away.

760
01:14:02,059 --> 01:14:05,126
He figures they're headed through here.

761
01:14:07,263 --> 01:14:09,963
Through the primitive area.

762
01:14:09,965 --> 01:14:11,965
Then there's no hope.

763
01:14:11,967 --> 01:14:15,268
There might be, jim.
They made it this far.

764
01:14:15,270 --> 01:14:17,236
It's only 40 miles more.

765
01:14:17,238 --> 01:14:20,038
But 40 miles of what?

766
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:22,173
The worst kind of country!

767
01:14:23,009 --> 01:14:26,343
Nancy, as you can guess,

768
01:14:26,345 --> 01:14:29,579
I've regretted that day when I
offered to take the animals.

769
01:14:29,581 --> 01:14:31,180
Nonsense, John.

770
01:14:31,182 --> 01:14:34,216
None of that.
It wasn't your fault.

771
01:14:34,218 --> 01:14:35,517
Oh, sure.

772
01:14:35,519 --> 01:14:38,152
But try to tell the youngsters that.

773
01:14:38,154 --> 01:14:41,221
They'll get over it, in time.

774
01:14:42,657 --> 01:14:45,224
Peter doesn't say much.

775
01:14:45,226 --> 01:14:47,226
I think he knew from the beginning...

776
01:14:47,228 --> 01:14:50,462
That an old dog wouldn't stand a chance.

777
01:14:50,464 --> 01:14:54,265
I think he's accepted the fact
that poor old Bodger's gone.

778
01:14:54,267 --> 01:14:56,200
And Elizabeth?

779
01:14:56,202 --> 01:15:00,904
Elizabeth's a strange one.
She's just the opposite.

780
01:15:00,906 --> 01:15:03,339
Firmly convinced in her own mind...

781
01:15:03,341 --> 01:15:05,541
That her cat's going to show up.

782
01:15:05,543 --> 01:15:09,244
Just has faith that her old
Tao cat will come walking in...

783
01:15:09,246 --> 01:15:13,147
As sassy and independent as ever.

784
01:15:13,149 --> 01:15:16,617
<i>The grownups wished they could
share the child's belief,</i>

785
01:15:16,619 --> 01:15:19,553
<i>But they knew it was too much to hope for.</i>

786
01:15:19,555 --> 01:15:22,155
<i>It was better to forget what had happened...</i>

787
01:15:22,157 --> 01:15:24,223
<i>And look forward to happier occasions.</i>

788
01:15:24,225 --> 01:15:28,493
♪ Happy birthday, dear Peter ♪

789
01:15:28,495 --> 01:15:31,496
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪♪

790
01:15:31,498 --> 01:15:33,097
Bravo!

791
01:15:33,099 --> 01:15:34,565
Blow them out.

792
01:15:37,870 --> 01:15:39,970
Did you make a wish?

793
01:15:39,972 --> 01:15:42,973
I don't feel much like it, really.

794
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:45,408
Not the wish I'd like to wish.

795
01:15:45,410 --> 01:15:48,444
Peter, I was going to wait
until you opened your presents,

796
01:15:48,446 --> 01:15:51,613
But I think this is the right
time for you to have this.

797
01:15:51,615 --> 01:15:53,147
Happy birthday.

798
01:15:53,149 --> 01:15:56,416
What is it?

799
01:15:56,418 --> 01:15:59,118
Registration papers
from the Kenmore Kennels.

800
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:01,553
They're holding a puppy in your name.

801
01:16:01,555 --> 01:16:04,455
Well, Peter.
Another bull terrier.

802
01:16:04,457 --> 01:16:07,324
How nice of you, John. What's his name?

803
01:16:07,326 --> 01:16:10,560
He's properly named, as tradition says,

804
01:16:10,562 --> 01:16:12,562
Starting with a "b."

805
01:16:12,564 --> 01:16:15,131
<i>Champion Birmingham...</i>

806
01:16:15,133 --> 01:16:16,999
Brigadier of Brocton.

807
01:16:17,001 --> 01:16:19,234
What's his color?

808
01:16:19,236 --> 01:16:21,169
White, of course.

809
01:16:21,171 --> 01:16:24,138
And so much like Bodger,
I just couldn't believe it!

810
01:16:25,207 --> 01:16:28,074
Peter, darling, can't you say thank you?

811
01:16:28,076 --> 01:16:30,843
Thank you, Uncle John.

812
01:16:30,845 --> 01:16:33,278
Suppose we serve the cake now, hmm?

813
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:35,847
Elizabeth, would you
get the ice cream, please?

814
01:16:35,849 --> 01:16:38,883
All right. Very nice of you, John.

815
01:16:41,187 --> 01:16:42,419
Listen.

816
01:16:42,421 --> 01:16:44,220
Listen, everybody!

817
01:16:44,222 --> 01:16:45,888
What is it?

818
01:16:45,890 --> 01:16:48,023
I hear a dog barking.

819
01:16:48,025 --> 01:16:50,025
I don't hear anything.

820
01:16:50,027 --> 01:16:51,292
I do.

821
01:16:51,294 --> 01:16:53,494
Daddy, it's Luath!

822
01:16:53,496 --> 01:16:56,029
Oh, Liz, please don't.

823
01:16:56,031 --> 01:16:57,630
But I'm sure of it.

824
01:16:57,632 --> 01:16:59,298
I know his bark.

825
01:16:59,300 --> 01:17:01,433
I think I hear it, too,

826
01:17:01,435 --> 01:17:02,901
Up on the hill.

827
01:17:04,471 --> 01:17:08,105
It's probably just somebody out hunting.

828
01:17:08,107 --> 01:17:11,942
You know, James, Luath might
have been able to make it.

829
01:17:11,944 --> 01:17:16,379
It could be Luath, dad.
Try calling him.

830
01:17:16,381 --> 01:17:17,980
<i>For a magic moment,</i>

831
01:17:17,982 --> 01:17:20,382
<i>James Hunter was as a child again,</i>

832
01:17:20,384 --> 01:17:22,350
<i>Hoping against hope.</i>

833
01:17:30,190 --> 01:17:32,190
It is!

834
01:17:33,426 --> 01:17:35,225
It is Luath!

835
01:17:36,962 --> 01:17:38,995
Look at him come!

836
01:17:44,268 --> 01:17:46,001
Come on, Luath!

837
01:17:46,003 --> 01:17:47,469
Come on, boy!

838
01:17:49,206 --> 01:17:50,572
Good boy, Luath.

839
01:17:50,574 --> 01:17:52,540
<i>I can't believe it.
Luath!</i>

840
01:17:52,542 --> 01:17:55,609
<i>In the general excitement,
everything else was forgotten,</i>

841
01:17:55,611 --> 01:17:59,145
<i>Peter, Bodger, and the cat.</i>

842
01:17:59,147 --> 01:18:01,380
<i>Quite ignored until Elizabeth...</i>

843
01:18:01,382 --> 01:18:03,215
<i>Heard a familiar voice.</i>

844
01:18:05,352 --> 01:18:08,986
Mother, it's Tao!
He's back!

845
01:18:10,456 --> 01:18:12,122
Tao!

846
01:18:13,125 --> 01:18:15,091
I can't believe it.
I know it's true,

847
01:18:15,093 --> 01:18:18,427
But I can't believe it!
I'd never have bet on it.

848
01:18:18,429 --> 01:18:22,163
<i>It was hard to believe, yet there he was...</i>

849
01:18:22,165 --> 01:18:24,865
<i>Safe in Elizabeth's arms.</i>

850
01:18:24,867 --> 01:18:26,466
<i>Her cat was home.</i>

851
01:18:26,468 --> 01:18:29,035
Peter, I'm sorry.

852
01:18:29,037 --> 01:18:33,238
Oh, it's all right.

853
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:35,973
Hi there, Luath.

854
01:18:37,042 --> 01:18:39,008
I'm glad he's back, dad.

855
01:18:39,010 --> 01:18:41,043
<i>And Tao cat, too.</i>

856
01:18:42,446 --> 01:18:45,947
I knew all along Bodger wouldn't make it.

857
01:18:45,949 --> 01:18:47,281
<i>He was just too old.</i>

858
01:18:47,283 --> 01:18:50,483
But Peter, you're not old,
and he's the same age.

859
01:18:52,186 --> 01:18:54,386
I feel old.

860
01:18:54,388 --> 01:18:57,322
And with dogs it's different.

861
01:18:59,492 --> 01:19:00,891
Look!

862
01:19:01,860 --> 01:19:03,793
<i>Bodger!</i>

863
01:19:04,495 --> 01:19:05,861
Bodger!

864
01:19:06,897 --> 01:19:08,029
Bodger!

865
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:10,898
<i>Miraculous as it seemed, it was Bodger.</i>

866
01:19:10,900 --> 01:19:13,433
<i>Champion Buracastle Brigadier of Doon,</i>

867
01:19:13,435 --> 01:19:15,834
<i>Coming as fast as he could.</i>

868
01:19:17,871 --> 01:19:19,270
Come on, boy.

869
01:19:19,272 --> 01:19:20,938
<i>Hurry!</i>

870
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:23,372
It is you!

871
01:19:23,374 --> 01:19:24,873
<i>Come on!</i>

872
01:19:25,876 --> 01:19:27,574
Oh, Bodger!

873
01:19:30,178 --> 01:19:32,211
It is you, you silly dog.

874
01:19:32,213 --> 01:19:34,246
Cut it out, Bodger.

875
01:19:39,820 --> 01:19:41,886
Bodger, stop it.

876
01:19:59,304 --> 01:20:01,337
<i>And so it was,</i>

877
01:20:01,339 --> 01:20:04,139
<i>3 devoted friends came marching home,</i>

878
01:20:04,141 --> 01:20:06,141
<i>Together as always,</i>

879
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:09,210
<i>They came to the end of
their incredible journey.</i>
