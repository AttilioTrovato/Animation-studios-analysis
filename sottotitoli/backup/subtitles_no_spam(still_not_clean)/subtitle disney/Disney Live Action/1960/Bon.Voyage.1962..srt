- SO WHAT?

75
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:42,356

THAT I'VE WATCHED YOU DREAM

76
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,024
ABOUT THIS TRIP
SINCE I WAS A BABY?

77
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,660
- HAS IT REALLY BEEN THAT LONG?

78
00:03:46,694 --> 00:03:48,028
- ARE YOU KIDDING, MOM?

79
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,096
THE FIRST THING
I CAN EVER REMEMBER

80
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:52,633
IS PLAYING WITH YOUR COLLECTION
OF TRAVEL FOLDERS.

81
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:53,934
- YOU KNOW WHY
WE HAD TO POSTPONE IT.

82

00:03:55,936 --> 00:03:59,307
- MM-HMM, SUCH AS ME FIRST
AND THEN ELLIOTT.

- I THOUGHT WE REALLY
HAD IT MADE AFTER THE WAR.

EVERYTHING WAS ALL SET,
AND THEN...

00:04:03,811 --> 00:04:05,879
- OKAY, OKAY, I KNOW.

87
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:08,549

YOU WERE THE NICEST SURPRISE

88
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:11,519

NOW, SKIPPER, YOU COUNT
THE BAGS, RIGHT?

97
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:35,075
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME, POP.

98
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,945
JUST MAKE SURE SOMEBODY ELSE
DOESN'T GOOF OFF.

99
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:41,649
- OH, ELLIOTT.
DON'T WANDER.

100
00:04:41,682 --> 00:04:43,817
WELL, NOW, THEN, UH,
LET'S DOUBLE-CHECK EVERYTHING,

101
00:04:43,851 --> 00:04:45,686

IT'S RIGHT HERE IN MY PURSE.

106
00:04:54,562 --> 00:04:56,364
YOU LEFT IT
ON THE HOTEL BUREAU.

107
00:04:56,397 --> 00:04:58,432

[laughs]

108
00:04:58,466 --> 00:04:59,567
WELL, LET'S ALL
STAY TOGETHER NOW

109
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,968

110
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:02,970
- HARRY, WHAT DID YOU DO
WITH MY MAKEUP KIT?

111
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:04,037
- I THOUGHT YOU HAD IT.

112
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:05,406
- YOU JUST TOOK IT FROM ME.

113
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:06,407

- THERE YOU ARE.

120
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:21,589
- BUD, WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
TO YOU FROM HERE ON,

121
00:05:21,622 --> 00:05:23,991
I WOULDN'T GO THROUGH
FOR A MILLION DOLLARS.

122
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:26,360
- OH, WE'LL BE ALL RIGHT
AS SOON AS WE GET ON BOARD

123
00:05:26,394 --> 00:05:28,529
AND GET SETTLED DOWN.
HERE YOU ARE.

- DON'T YOU THINK
YOU'D BETTER FIND SKIPPER?

128
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:37,905
- OH, I THOUGHT--
I THOUGHT YOU HAD HIM.

129
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:39,973
- NO, NO, HE WENT IN THAT DOOR
DOWN THERE, DARLING.

130
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:43,711
- SKIPPER!
SKIPPER!

- GREAT START, POP.
PARDON ME.

135
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:06,867
- DON'T CLOSE THE DOOR, PLEASE.
WOULD YOU LET HIM OUT, PLEASE?

136
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,901
- EXCUSE ME, EXCUSE ME.

137
00:06:07,935 --> 00:06:09,670
EXCUSE ME.

138
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:16,577
- THERE'S NO EXCUSE FOR ANY
OF US TO FALL APART HERE.

139
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:20,814
- OH.

140
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:24,818
- NOW, YOU WAIT FOR ME, KATIE.
DON'T GO RUNNING OFF.

141
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:52,713
- HARRY!
HARRY, OVER HERE, DEAR.

142
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:06,527
- KATIE, I'D APPRECIATE IT
IF WE'D JUST STAY TOGETHER.

143
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,861
- YES, DEAR.
UH, WE GO OVER THERE.

144
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:09,863
- OH.

145
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,469
BOY, I CAN'T WAIT
UNTIL WE GET ON BOARD

146
00:07:15,503 --> 00:07:16,737
SO WE CAN SETTLE DOWN
AND RELAX.

147
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,906
- MM-HMM.

148
00:07:20,007 --> 00:07:22,476
- HEY, HEY, HEY!

149
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,712
- THANK GOODNESS WE DON'T KNOW
ANYBODY IN NEW YORK,

150
00:07:24,745 --> 00:07:26,714
SO WE WON'T HAVE ONE OF THOSE
BON VOYAGE PARTIES.

151
00:07:26,747 --> 00:07:29,583
- MM-HMM.

152
00:07:29,617 --> 00:07:30,651
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"MM-HMM"?

153
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:33,854
- WELL, I WAS JUST THINKING
THAT THERE MIGHT BE

154
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,888
SOME WELL-MEANING RELATIVES
WHO MIGHT--

155
00:07:34,922 --> 00:07:37,057
- KATIE, I THOUGHT--
I THOUGHT YOU PARENTS SAID

156
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,992
THEY COULDN'T BE HERE?
- YES, THEY DID.

157
00:07:39,026 --> 00:07:41,194
BUT BOSTON ISN'T
THAT FAR AWAY.

158
00:07:41,228 --> 00:07:43,731
HARRY, WOULD YOU DO ME
A FAVOR?

159
00:07:43,764 --> 00:07:45,232
WILL YOU LOOK PLEASANT
WHEN YOU GO INTO THE STATEROOM?

160
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:46,834
- OH, KATIE, YOU KNOW
I DON'T LIKE PARTIES.

161
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:47,801
I'M JUST NO GOOD AT DRINKING.

162
00:07:47,835 --> 00:07:50,838
- YOU'RE ALWAYS COMPLAINING
ABOUT PARTIES.

163
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:53,006
AND THEN IT'S YOU THAT WINDS UP
HAVING ALL THE FUN.

164
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,843
- NEXT.

165
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:57,210
- UH, W-WHERE'S AMY?

166
00:07:57,244 --> 00:07:58,746
SHE'S GOT THE PASSPORT,
HASN'T SHE?

167
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:00,147
- UH, SHE'S OVER THERE
TALKING TO THAT YOUNG MAN.

168
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,083
- WHERE THE DEVIL
DID SHE MEET THAT FELLOW?

169
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:04,284
- PROBABLY IN THE ELEVATOR.

170
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,853
- HOW COULD SHE POSSIBLY
MEET SOMEONE

171
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:07,821
DURING A TEN-SECOND
ELEVATOR RIDE?

172
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:09,089
I'VE BEEN RIDING IN ELEVATORS
ALL MY LIFE.

173
00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:10,591
I NEVER MET ANYONE.

174
00:08:10,624 --> 00:08:12,025
- HE LOOKS RATHER NICE.

175
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:12,893
- THAT'S PROBABLY
WHAT HE DOES--

176
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:14,862
HANGS AROUND ELEVATORS
ALL THE TIME.

177
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:16,129
THEY HAVE A NAME
FOR HIS KIND--

178
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:17,598
ELEVATOR LURKERS.

179
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:18,732
- OH, DON'T BE SILLY, HARRY.

180
00:08:18,766 --> 00:08:20,067
HE'S ONE OF THE PASSENGERS.

181
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,602
- KATIE, SOMETIMES
I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU.

182
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:23,003
HERE A FELLOW
PICKS UP YOUR DAUGHTER

183
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:25,005
RIGHT UNDER YOUR NOSE,
AND YOU'RE VERY CALM ABOUT IT.

184
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:27,140
- WELL, BOYS
HAVE TO MEET GIRLS.

185
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:28,842
THAT'S THE WAY
THE WHOLE THING WORKS.

186
00:08:28,876 --> 00:08:30,578
- WELL, MAYBE THAT'S THE WAY
THE WHOLE THING WORKS,

187
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:31,612
BUT I DON'T LIKE IT.

188
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:33,013
- OH, YOU'VE BEEN
A NERVOUS WRECK

189
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:34,815
EVER SINCE AMY TURNED 14.

190
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:37,084
AND I THINK SHE TAKES CARE
OF HERSELF BEAUTIFULLY.

191
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:39,620
- YOU CALL THAT TAKING CARE
OF HERSELF BEAUTIFULLY?

192
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:41,021
WE TURN OUR BACKS
FOR ONE SPLIT SECOND,

193
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:42,890
AND HERE'S SOME YOUNG SPOOK
MASSAGING HER ARM,

194
00:08:42,923 --> 00:08:45,158
AND AMY LOOKING UP AT HIM
AS IF HE WERE--

195
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:47,595
- SHH.
THEY'RE COMING OVER.

196
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:52,299
- MOM, DAD, I WANT YOU
TO MEET NICK O'MARA.

197
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:53,967
HE'S GOING OVER
ON THE SHIP WITH US.

198
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:54,802
- HOW DO YOU DO?

199
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:55,803
- HOW DO YOU DO?
HOW DO YOU DO, SIR?

200
00:08:55,836 --> 00:08:58,138
I MUST APOLOGIZE
FOR SPEAKING TO YOUR DAUGHTER,

201
00:08:58,171 --> 00:08:59,873
BUT AFTER ALL,
SHIPBOARD INFORMALITY

202
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:01,141
IS TRADITIONAL, ISN'T IT?

203
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:03,010
- UH, A TRADITION
OF THE SEA, DADDY.

204
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,011
- AND FOR ALL
PRACTICAL PURPOSES,

205
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,614
WE ARE ALMOST ABOARD SHIP NOW,
DON'T YOU AGREE?

206
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:08,882
- YES, FOR ALL
PRACTICAL PURPOSES.

207
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:09,983
- NEXT.

208
00:09:10,017 --> 00:09:12,019
- OH, UH, AMY, COULD I HAVE
THE PASSPORT, PLEASE?

209
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,053
- OH, YES.

210
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:17,891
- THANK YOU.

211
00:09:17,925 --> 00:09:19,727
- AMY.
- OH.

212
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,029
- UH, FAMILY PASSPORT, HUH?

213
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:25,232
FINE.

214
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:26,233
WHERE ARE THE OTHERS?

215
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:28,836
- OH, THE TWO BOYS
WILL BE HERE IN A MINUTE.

216
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:32,740
- SORRY, YOU'LL HAVE
TO STAND ASIDE.

217
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:35,643
I HAVE TO FIT THE FACES
TO THE PASSPORT.

218
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:38,145
- OH.
- NEXT.

219
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:40,013
- I KNOW THE CHIEF PURSER
RATHER WELL.

220
00:09:40,047 --> 00:09:42,883
IF THERE'S ANYTHING I CAN DO--
- YEAH, WOULD YOU HOLD THIS?

221
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,018
I'LL GO AND SEE IF I CAN FIND
THE TWO MISSING FACES.

222
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:48,822
AND, MOTHER, YOU AND AMY
STAY HERE, PLEASE?

223
00:09:48,856 --> 00:09:51,191
- UH, I'LL GO LOOK
FOR THE PURSER.

224
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,663
- ELLIOTT.
WAIT A MINUTE.

225
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,033
DID YOU FIND HIM?
- NO.

226
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:01,168
- NOW, LOOK,
THE PASSPORT DESK

227
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:02,235
IS RIGHT AT THE TOP
OF THOSE STAIRS.

228
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:03,203
YOUR MOTHER AND AMY
ARE UP THERE.

229
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:05,138
NOW YOU GO UP AND JOIN THEM.
AND STAY THERE.

230
00:10:05,172 --> 00:10:07,908
- OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT.

231
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,855
SKIPPER.

232
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:24,958
SKIPPER, GET OFF OF THERE.

233
00:10:24,992 --> 00:10:26,393
- HI, POP.
ANYTHING WRONG?

234
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:27,695
- NO, NO.
- I GOT IT RIGHT HERE.

235
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:30,130
HEY!
- WAIT, WAIT, HOLD IT!

236
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:32,032
WAIT, WHOA.
- HEY, THIS IS NEAT.

237
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:34,434
- WELL, YEAH,
YOU JUST HANG ON, THAT'S--

238
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,969
- WE'VE GOT TO DO IT
BY THE RULES.

239
00:10:36,003 --> 00:10:39,206
- RULES AND REGULATIONS.
I ONLY SEE--

240
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,049
- THAT'S FOUR AND FIVE.

241
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:51,919
ALL FACES PRESENT
AND ACCOUNTED FOR, CORRECT?

242
00:11:04,765 --> 00:11:06,867
- OKAY.

243
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,703
MRS. WILLARD.

244
00:11:09,737 --> 00:11:11,739
- THANK YOU.

245
00:11:14,742 --> 00:11:17,811
- GREAT START, POP.

246
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,123
- WHOOPS.
[laughs]

247
00:11:30,157 --> 00:11:32,325
SORRY.

248
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:37,064
[indistinct singing
in the distance]

249
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:40,768
[indistinct chatter]

250
00:12:15,102 --> 00:12:17,204
- HARRY, YOU OLD RASCAL.
- WELL.

251
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,306
- I WONDERED IF MY SON-IN-LAW
WAS EVER GOING TO SHOW UP.

252
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:21,208
- HOW ARE YOU, MR. BIDWELL--
UH, HORACE--

253
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,877
I MEAN, DAD?

254
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:25,012
- WELL, HOW DO YOU
LIKE IT, HUH?

255
00:12:25,045 --> 00:12:26,179
YOU DIDN'T THINK
I WAS GOING TO LET

256
00:12:26,213 --> 00:12:27,314
MY LITTLE DAUGHTER
GO OFF TO PARIS

257
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:29,049
WITHOUT A PARTY,
DID YOU?

258
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:32,052
- NO, NO, I GUESS
DEEP DOWN IN MY HEART, I DIDN'T.

259
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,120
- I JUST TOLD HER MOTHER

260
00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:35,055
I'LL GATHER UP SOME
OF KATIE'S OLD SCHOOL CHUMS,

261
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,857
A HALF A DOZEN OR SO
OF HER OLD SUITORS,

262
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:39,059
AND WE'LL LET KATIE KNOW
WE HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN HER.

263
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,028
[laughs]

264
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:43,864
- [chuckles] WELL, IT'S--
IT'S VERY NICE OF YOU, DAD--

265
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:46,133
HO-HO-HORACE--
I MEAN, MR. BIDWELL.

266
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,334
- YOU KNOW, HARRY,

267
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:50,037
I GUESS NONE OF US
WILL EVER FORGIVE YOU

268
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,138
FOR STEALING OUR LITTLE GIRL
AND TAKING HER OUT

269
00:12:51,171 --> 00:12:54,041
TO THAT, UH, TERRE HAUTE
OR WHATEVER IT IS OUT THERE.

270
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:55,475
- IT'S, UH, TERRE HAUTE, SIR.

271
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:56,676
AND IT REALLY ISN'T TOO BAD.

272
00:12:56,709 --> 00:13:00,147
WE, UH, HAVE THE INDIANS PRETTY
WELL UNDER CONTROL BY NOW.

273
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,282
- [laughs]
- AND WE HAVE TELEVISION.

274
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:04,818
AND WE GET UP TO CHICAGO
FOR A WEEKEND NOW AND THEN,

275
00:13:04,852 --> 00:13:08,188
SO, UH...
- CHICAGO.

276
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:11,058
WELL, WHY NOT?

277
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:16,496
- OH.

278
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:21,935
[indistinct chatter]

279
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,076
- GREAT GIRL, THAT KATHERINE.

280
00:13:29,109 --> 00:13:31,211
- YEAH, SHE'S A GREAT GIRL,
ALL RIGHT.

281
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:32,612
- HAVE YOU KNOWN HER LONG?

282
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,581
- UH, A FEW YEARS.

283
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:39,086
- I TOOK KATHERINE
ON HER VERY FIRST DATE.

284
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:40,954
DO YOU BELIEVE IT?
- WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT?

285
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:44,157
I'VE HAD A FEW DATES
WITH KATHERINE MYSELF.

286
00:13:44,191 --> 00:13:47,327
- KATHERINE WAS NEVER
A RAVING BEAUTY, BY ANY MEANS,

287
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,430
BUT SHE WAS HANDSOME.

288
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:54,367
YES, UH, THAT'S THE WORD
FOR KATHERINE--HANDSOME.

289
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:59,606
- I'D SAY SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL.

290
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:03,143
- YOU'RE NOT FROM BOSTON,
ARE YOU?

291
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,344
- NO, NO, I'M NOT.

292
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:07,147
- I THOUGHT I'D NEVER
SEEN YOU AROUND.

293
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,349
- MY NAME'S WILLARD.
HARRY WILLARD.

294
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:12,953
- YOU DON'T SAY.

295
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:15,055
- WILLARD?

296
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:17,324
SO YOU'RE THE ONE!

297
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:20,961
- YES, I'M THE ONE.

298
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:24,631
- WELL.

299
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:28,168
WELL.

300
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,070
- MAVIS, DON'T TELL ME
YOU DIDN'T KNOW.

301
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:32,439
SHE MARRIED A PLUMBER
OR A PLUMBING CONTRACTOR

302
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:34,141
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
OUT WEST.

303
00:14:34,174 --> 00:14:35,275
- OH, CAN YOU IMAGINE?

304
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:38,045
A GIRL LIKE THAT WITH HER
EDUCATION AND BACKGROUND.

305
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:40,948
OH, I'D GIVE ANYTHING TO KNOW
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.

306
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:42,015
- WOULD YOU REALLY?

307
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:43,016
WELL, I'D JUST LOVE
TO TELL YOU,

308
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,152
BECAUSE I JUST HAPPEN TO KNOW
THE WHOLE STORY.

309
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:47,454
- YOU DO?
- YES, I DO.

310
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:50,290
ACTUALLY, IT SEEMS THAT ONE
SUMMER KATHERINE WENT

311
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:51,424
OUT TO THIS TERRE HAUTE PLACE

312
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:54,361
TO VISIT A COLLEGE FRIEND
OF HERS, HARRIET FEDLING.

313
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:57,931
AND THIS WILLARD FELLOW, WELL,
HE'S IN PLUMBING, YOU KNOW.

314
00:14:57,965 --> 00:14:59,566
- YES, WE KNOW.

315
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:00,667
- OH, YOU KNOW THAT.

316
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:04,237
WELL, ANYWAY HE MET KATHERINE
AT THE FEDLING HOME,

317
00:15:04,271 --> 00:15:07,240
AND, UH, WELL, HE JUST FELL
FOR HER LIKE A TON OF BRICKS.

318
00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:09,642
BUT SHE COULDN'T SEE HIM
FOR DUST.

319
00:15:09,676 --> 00:15:12,479
WELL, ONE EVENING
THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE

320
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:15,215
ONE OF THOSE WIENER ROASTS,
YOU KNOW HOW THEY DO?

321
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,084
I GUESS THERE JUST ISN'T
TOO MUCH TO DO

322
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:19,219
AROUND A PLACE
LIKE TERRE HAUTE.

323
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,321
AND HE FINALLY MANAGED
TO TALK KATHERINE

324
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:23,223
INTO GOING WITH HIM.

325
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:25,959
WELL, OF COURSE, KATHERINE
CALLED IT A WIENER ROAST,

326
00:15:25,993 --> 00:15:28,295
AND HE CALLED IT
A WIENIE ROAST.

327
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:29,296
[laughs]

328
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:31,098
[both laugh]

329
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:32,632
WELL, THEY GOT INTO
A BIG ARGUMENT ABOUT THAT,

330
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:36,169
AND, UH, SO TO SHUT HER UP,
I KISSED HER,

331
00:15:36,203 --> 00:15:37,737
AND SHE KISSED ME BACK,
AND WE GOT MARRIED.

332
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,173
THAT'S ABOUT THE WHOLE STORY
IN A NUTSHELL.

333
00:15:40,207 --> 00:15:43,510
CHEERS.
[laughs]

334
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:45,412
- [whispering indistinctly]

335
00:15:47,214 --> 00:15:48,581
- WHOOPS!
[laughs]

336
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:52,219
SORRY.

337
00:15:54,787 --> 00:16:00,093
[singing indistinctly]

338
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:01,628
WHOOPS!
HA HA, SORRY.

339
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:03,496
*

340
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,198
- POP!

341
00:16:05,232 --> 00:16:08,035
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING,
BUT IT LOOKS VERY SILLY.

342
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:10,237
- WELL, ELLIOTT,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING

343
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,638
SITTING OUT HERE
ALL BY YOURSELF?

344
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:13,773
NOTHING WRONG IN THERE.
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

345
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,343
GO BACK TO YOUR PARTY.
DRINK.

346
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:17,344
BE HAPPY.

347
00:16:17,377 --> 00:16:18,445
I'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

348
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:19,712
- OH, COME ON, NOW, ELLIOTT.

349
00:16:19,746 --> 00:16:20,780
SNAP OUT OF IT.

350
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,382
THIS IS OUR TRIP.
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE HAVING FUN.

351
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:26,086
- FUN?
OH, THAT'S IRONIC.

352
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:28,221
IT'S TRULY IRONIC.
- WHAT'S WRONG, SON?

353
00:16:28,255 --> 00:16:29,656
YOU CAN TELL ME.

354
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:32,059
- DAD, LET'S NOT DO THE
MAN-TO-MAN-TALK BIT NOW, OKAY?

355
00:16:32,092 --> 00:16:33,126
I-I COULDN'T TAKE IT.

356
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,462
- OH, LOOK, THE SHIP'S CRAWLING
WITH PRETTY GIRLS.

357
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:38,098
GO AND FIND YOURSELF A GIRL.
- YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, POP.

358
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:39,766
YOU JUST DON'T
UNDERSTAND ANYTHING.

359
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:42,502
- I WISH YOU'D STOP TALKING
LIKE I'M FROM MARS OR SOMETHING.

360
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:44,071
WHAT DON'T I UNDERSTAND?

361
00:16:44,104 --> 00:16:47,107
- SIMPLY THIS--I'M NOT
INTERESTED IN OTHER GIRLS.

362
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:50,077
I'M DEEPLY, BEAUTIFULLY IN LOVE
WITH A VERY FINE PERSON.

363
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,711
TOGETHER, WE MIGHT HAVE HAD
A CHANCE FOR HAPPINESS.

364
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:53,113
TOGETHER, WE--
- WAIT A MINUTE.

365
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:54,381
ELLIOTT, ARE YOU TALKING

366
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:56,383
ABOUT THAT SCRAWNY HAMILTON KID
BACK HOME?

367
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,585
THE ONE WITH THE FLOPPY BANGS
THAT CALLS ME "CHUM"?

368
00:16:58,618 --> 00:17:01,521
- DAD, IF WE CAN'T DISCUSS RUTH

369
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:03,090
WITH THE RESPECT
TO WHICH SHE IS ENTITLED,

370
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:04,524
I'D RATHER WE DIDN'T
DISCUSS IT AT ALL.

371
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:05,525
- OH, NOW, ELLIOTT.

372
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:08,128
- MAY I HAVE A SIP
OF YOUR CHAMPAGNE, PLEASE?

373
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:10,263
- WELL.
- THANKS.

374
00:17:10,297 --> 00:17:11,598
- NOW, LOOK, ELLIOTT.

375
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:13,066
I DON'T WANT TO GET ANGRY
WITH YOU ON THIS TRIP.

376
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,401
I WANT TO BE PATIENT.

377
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:17,204
- I KNOW YOU'RE TRYING, POP.
- WELL, THANK YOU.

378
00:17:17,237 --> 00:17:18,438
NOW, LET'S PUT IT THIS WAY.

379
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:20,240
IF I'D HAD A CHANCE
TO TAKE A TRIP TO EUROPE

380
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:22,375
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE,
I'D HAVE BEEN OVERCOME WITH JOY.

381
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:25,245
- IS THERE STILL TIME FOR ME
TO GET OFF THE BOAT?

382
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:27,580
- ALL RIGHT, SUPPOSE I SAID,
"GO AHEAD, GET OFF THE BOAT."

383
00:17:27,614 --> 00:17:28,848
WHERE WOULD YOU GO?
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

384
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,583
- I'D HOP THE FIRST TRAIN
BACK HOME.

385
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:33,753
- OH, NOW.
- DO YOU MEAN I CAN?

386
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:36,123
- ELLIOTT,
NOW YOU LISTEN TO ME.

387
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:37,757
NOTHING OR NOBODY
IS GOING TO SPOIL THIS TRIP

388
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,092
FOR YOUR MOTHER.

389
00:17:39,126 --> 00:17:40,193
SO IF YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO CHEER UP,

390
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:41,261
YOU'D BETTER
GET OFF THIS SHIP,

391
00:17:41,294 --> 00:17:42,595
AND YOU'D BETTER
GET OFF RIGHT NOW,

392
00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:44,731
BECAUSE IF YOU PULL
THIS LONG-FACE HOCUS-POCUS

393
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:46,699
AFTER WE SAIL, I'M GOING
TO THROW YOU OVERBOARD.

394
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:53,873
- ALL VISITORS ASHORE, PLEASE.
ALL VISITORS ASHORE.

395
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,109
ALL VISITORS ASHORE, PLEASE.

396
00:17:56,143 --> 00:17:59,179
[air horn blows]

397
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:06,619
- YAHOO!

398
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:20,900
YIPPEE!

399
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:24,337
WE'RE ON OUR WAY, POP.

400
00:18:24,371 --> 00:18:26,139
YAY!

401
00:18:26,173 --> 00:18:28,175
- HANG ON.
- YAHOO!

402
00:18:58,238 --> 00:19:00,807
- LIBERTY--
GIVEN BY THE PEOPLE OF FRANCE

403
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,509
IN FRIENDSHIP AND BROTHERHOOD
TO THE PEOPLE

404
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:06,379
OF THE UNITED STATES
IN THE YEAR 1884.

405
00:19:06,413 --> 00:19:08,481
FUNNY, ALL THE THINGS
I'VE READ ABOUT THAT STATUE,

406
00:19:08,515 --> 00:19:09,949
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
I'VE SEEN HER...

407
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,918
IN, UH, PERSON, THAT IS.

408
00:19:11,951 --> 00:19:13,286
WELL, MOTHER, WHAT DO YOU SAY

409
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,621
WE TAKE A LITTLE STROLL
AROUND THE DECK?

410
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:17,657
HOW ABOUT, UH, AFT?
- ALL RIGHT.

411
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:18,958
- OH.

412
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,261
- THAT'S, UH, QUITE A SIGHT,
ISN'T IT?

413
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:22,729
- YOU KNOW, ALL THE TIMES
I'VE BEEN ACROSS,

414
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:24,397
I STILL GET A CHARGE
OUT OF THE OLD GIRL.

415
00:19:24,431 --> 00:19:26,733
- I GUESS YOU'VE BEEN
BACK AND FORTH QUITE A LOT.

416
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:27,700
- IT'S HIS 13TH CROSSING.

417
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:31,404
AND ALREADY NICK SAYS
IT'S HIS LUCKY ONE.

418
00:19:31,438 --> 00:19:34,507
HIS MOTHER LIVES IN PARIS.
SHE'S A CONTESSA, IMAGINE.

419
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,543
AND HE WENT TO SCHOOL THERE
PART OF THE TIME.

420
00:19:36,576 --> 00:19:39,646
HIS FATHER--HIS REAL FATHER,
THAT IS, LIVES IN NEW YORK

421
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,948
AND IS MARRIED
TO A FAMOUS PAINTER.

422
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:44,417
- YOU MUST LEAD QUITE
AN INTERESTING LIFE, MR. O'HARA.

423
00:19:44,451 --> 00:19:47,487
- O'MARA, FATHER--
NICHOLAS O'MARA.

424
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,689
HE'S AN ARCHITECT.
- OH.

425
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:50,623
- WELL, NOT EXACTLY.

426
00:19:50,657 --> 00:19:51,624
I JUST FINISHED
MY GRADUATE WORK AT YALE.

427
00:19:51,658 --> 00:19:54,961
- OH, WITH HONORS
AND OFFERS FROM ALL SIDES.

428
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:58,231
AND HIS SKETCHES WON SOME VERY
IMPORTANT PRIZE IN NEW YORK.

429
00:19:58,265 --> 00:19:59,566
HE'S GOING OVER
TO VISIT HIS MOTHER NOW,

430
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:01,368
BUT IF EUROPE LOOKS
AT ALL INTERESTING THIS SEASON,

431
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:05,405
HE MAY DO SOME FIELD STUDIES
OVER THERE.

432
00:20:05,438 --> 00:20:06,806
- MY, WE CERTAINLY KNOW
A LOT ABOUT YOU,

433
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:08,608
DON'T WE, MR. O'MARA?

434
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:11,278
- IF YOU DON'T MIND, I'D LIKE
TO SHOW AMY AROUND THE SHIP.

435
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:15,014
- WELL, UH...

436
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,949
HE DID SAY YALE, DIDN'T HE?

437
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:20,487
- HARRY, SOME OF THE SWEETEST
BOYS I KNEW WENT TO YALE.

438
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,255
I HOPE SKIPPER ISN'T GETTING
INTO ANY TROUBLE.

439
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:25,658
- OH, FORGET SKIPPER.
THE ONE I'M WORRIED ABOUT IS--

440
00:20:30,697 --> 00:20:33,966
- YOUR CHIN IS HANGING, HARRY.

441
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,503
WELL, THERE'S ONE GIRL
WHO WON'T CALL YOU CHUM...

442
00:20:36,536 --> 00:20:38,638
CHUM.

443
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:39,706
- HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT?

444
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,308
AND I WAS FEELING
SORRY FOR HIM.

445
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:43,776
- [chuckles]
ELLIOTT ENJOYS SUFFERING.

446
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:44,744
WHY DON'T YOU RELAX?

447
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:46,913
- [chuckles]
ALL RIGHT.

448
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:49,549
AS THE TRAVEL FOLDERS SAY,
WHEN YOU STEP ABOARD

449
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,551
THIS MAGNIFICENT
LUXURY LINER,

450
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,553
DULL CARE
WILL MAGICALLY VANISH.

451
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:55,288
ANXIETIES DISAPPEAR.

452
00:20:55,322 --> 00:20:58,658
YOU WILL LIVE FIVE, LOVELY,
LAZY, CAREFREE DAYS AFLOAT.

453
00:20:58,691 --> 00:20:59,926
[both chuckle]

454
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:01,828
I'M SORRY YOU HAD
TO WAIT SO LONG, KATIE.

455
00:21:01,861 --> 00:21:03,630
- OH, DARLING, THIS IS ONE

456
00:21:03,663 --> 00:21:06,999
OF THE ABSOLUTELY PERFECT
MOMENTS OF MY LIFE.

457
00:21:16,676 --> 00:21:18,978
- YOU KNOW THE MOST WONDERFUL
THING ABOUT THIS TRIP?

458
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:20,680
IT'S GOING TO GIVE ME A CHANCE
TO GET REACQUAINTED

459
00:21:20,713 --> 00:21:21,948
WITH MY FAMILY.

460
00:21:21,981 --> 00:21:23,082
WHAT WITH WORK AND ALL,
I HAD THE FEELING

461
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,183
I WAS NEGLECTING YOU ALL.

462
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:27,086
- NONSENSE, DARLING.
YOU'VE BEEN A WONDERFUL FATHER.

463
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,955
- I FIGURED OUT A FEW THINGS
THAT MIGHT BE FUN

464
00:21:28,988 --> 00:21:30,056
FOR ALL OF US
TO DO THIS MORNING.

465
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:32,625
- OH, I'M AFRAID YOU'LL HAVE
TO COUNT ME OUT, DADDY.

466
00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:34,093
I'VE GOT A DATE WITH NICK
AT 9:30.

467
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,495
- OH.
- BYE, MOM.

468
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:36,896
- BYE-BYE.

469
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:38,698
- WELL, I GUESS--
- THAT REMINDS ME.

470
00:21:38,731 --> 00:21:41,668
I BETTER CRANK UP
AND FIND THAT EAST INDIAN GIRL.

471
00:21:41,701 --> 00:21:43,636
I WANT TO GET IN SOLID WITH HER
BEFORE SOME SHARP OPERATOR

472
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:44,637
GETS A HOLD OF HER.

473
00:21:44,671 --> 00:21:45,572
- SHE'S VERY LOVELY, ELLIOTT.

474
00:21:45,605 --> 00:21:49,041
- YEAH, KIND OF MYSTERIOUS
AND SPIRITUAL.

475
00:21:49,075 --> 00:21:50,577
THAT STUFF
DOES SOMETHING TO ME.

476
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,412
HEY, DAD,
YOU MAY BE RIGHT

477
00:21:52,445 --> 00:21:54,046
ABOUT THAT RUTH HAMILTON,
AFTER ALL.

478
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,950
NEXT TO THIS GIRL,
SHE DOES SEEM KIND OF CLUNKY.

479
00:21:57,984 --> 00:21:59,452
- AS YOU CAN SEE ALREADY,

480
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:01,854
TRAVEL IS BEGINNING TO BROADEN
ELLIOTT'S OUTLOOK.

481
00:22:01,888 --> 00:22:03,923
- YES.
- [laughs]

482
00:22:03,956 --> 00:22:05,057
- WELL, MOTHER,
WHAT DO WE DO THIS MORNING?

483
00:22:05,091 --> 00:22:06,659
I'M NOT GOING TO NEGLECT YOU.
- OF COURSE YOU'RE NOT.

484
00:22:06,693 --> 00:22:07,660
I WON'T LET YOU.

485
00:22:07,694 --> 00:22:08,895
I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT
TO GET MY HAIR WASHED.

486
00:22:08,928 --> 00:22:10,096
- OH, YOU KNOW,
WAIT A MINUTE.

487
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:11,531
YOU'RE ALL GOING TO RUN OFF
AND LEAVE ME?

488
00:22:11,564 --> 00:22:12,565
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

489
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:13,800
- WELL, THERE'S ALWAYS SKIPPER.

490
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,802
YOU SAID YOU WANTED TIME
TO KNOW HIM BETTER.

491
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:18,438
THAT'S RIGHT, FATHER AND SON
SHOULD BE BETTER PALS.

492
00:22:18,471 --> 00:22:19,372
WHERE IS SKIPPER?

493
00:22:19,406 --> 00:22:21,541
- WELL, HE MUST BE SOMEPLACE
ON THE SHIP.

494
00:22:21,574 --> 00:22:22,842
WOULD YOU LIKE TO WALK ME
TO THE BEAUTY SHOP?

495
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:23,843
- SURE, YOU KNOW WHERE IT IS?
- NO.

496
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:25,111
- WELL, I'LL SHOW YOU.

497
00:22:25,144 --> 00:22:26,946
GOT A LAYOUT OF THE SHIP
RIGHT HERE.

498
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:33,986
- OKAY, POP.

499
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,455
- OH, ALL SET, BOY?

500
00:22:35,488 --> 00:22:36,989
OKAY.

501
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:37,890
ALL RIGHT, NOW,
DON'T BE AFRAID.

502
00:22:37,924 --> 00:22:39,926
JUST TRY TO HIT ME
AS HARD AS YOU CAN.

503
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:42,462
COME ON.

504
00:22:42,495 --> 00:22:46,466
[groans]

505
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:48,468
- GEE, I DIDN'T HURT YOU,
DID I, POP?

506
00:22:48,501 --> 00:22:50,637
- NO, DON'T--DON'T BE
SILLY, SKIPPER.

507
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:51,938
HOW COULD A LITTLE FELLOW
LIKE YOU

508
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:54,941
HURT A BIG FELLOW
LIKE ME?

509
00:22:54,974 --> 00:22:56,876
[laughter]

510
00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:02,682
THERE, THAT'S--
THAT'S A VERY GOOD JAB.

511
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:03,850
GOOD.
GOOD, SKIPPER.

512
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:05,418
THERE YOU GO.
CATCH IT.

513
00:23:05,452 --> 00:23:06,586
- NICE CATCH.

514
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:08,821
- ALL RIGHT, GET THAT ONE.
HERE.

515
00:23:08,855 --> 00:23:09,922
- GET THIS ONE.

516
00:23:09,956 --> 00:23:13,826
- OH, WHOA.
[laughs]

517
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,963
[breathing heavily]

518
00:23:19,165 --> 00:23:20,132
OH, OH.

519
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:22,769
[sighs]

520
00:23:24,637 --> 00:23:28,007
[laughs]

521
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,977
- [laughs]
SILLY.

522
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:32,945
OH, WE'RE NOT GOING
TO ENGLAND.

523
00:23:32,979 --> 00:23:35,448
FIRST PARIS
AND THEN THE RIVIERA.

524
00:23:35,482 --> 00:23:37,049
- WAIT TILL YOU GET TO PARIS.
YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE IT THERE.

525
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:39,552
YOU REALLY ARE.

526
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:40,553
HEY.

527
00:23:40,587 --> 00:23:42,589
THERE YOU ARE.

528
00:23:42,622 --> 00:23:43,690
- THANKS.

529
00:23:43,723 --> 00:23:44,591
- IN CANNES,
THE BEACH IS BEAUTIFUL.

530
00:23:44,624 --> 00:23:49,095
YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE IT.

531
00:23:50,997 --> 00:23:52,532
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THAT FELLOW O'MARA?

532
00:23:52,565 --> 00:23:54,934
[both laughing]

533
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:56,135
- SEARCH ME.

534
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:57,937
HE'S NO DIFFERENT
FROM THE OTHER CREEPS

535
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:00,640
AMY GOES WITH BACK HOME.
READY?

536
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:04,110
GET THIS ONE!
- OH.

537
00:24:04,143 --> 00:24:06,045
[laughs]
A LITTLE HIGH!

538
00:24:13,853 --> 00:24:16,155
- COME ON, LET'S GO!

539
00:24:25,832 --> 00:24:27,834
- OH!

540
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:45,618
ALL RIGHT, COME ON.
LET IT GO.

541
00:24:45,652 --> 00:24:46,819
- OKAY.

542
00:24:46,853 --> 00:24:48,020
- ATTA BOY.

543
00:24:48,054 --> 00:24:49,589
OH, OH.

544
00:24:49,622 --> 00:24:50,990
I'LL GET IT.

545
00:24:51,023 --> 00:24:51,991
[cracking]

546
00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:55,962
OOH!

547
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:57,830
OH, THAT'S NICE.
EASY.

548
00:24:57,864 --> 00:24:59,065
OH, JUST TAKE IT EASY.
OH.

549
00:24:59,098 --> 00:25:01,601
OH!

550
00:25:01,634 --> 00:25:03,269
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

551
00:25:03,302 --> 00:25:04,837
THANKS, FELLOWS.

552
00:25:04,871 --> 00:25:06,806
IT'S AN OLD FOOTBALL INJURY.

553
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,941
I GOT IT IN THE PURDUE GAME.

554
00:25:08,975 --> 00:25:10,943
- SKIPPER, YOU WANT TO GO
FOR A SWIM?

555
00:25:10,977 --> 00:25:13,279
THEY GOT A PRETTY GOOD POOL
IN THIS TUB.

556
00:25:13,312 --> 00:25:14,881
- YEAH, SKIP, WHY DON'T YOU?

557
00:25:14,914 --> 00:25:17,216
- NO, THANKS, FELLOWS.
I GOT TO PLAY WITH MY POP.

558
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:20,887
- OKAY.
SO LONG.

559
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:24,657
- SO LONG, FELLOWS.

560
00:25:33,633 --> 00:25:35,902
- NOW, YOU TAKE
THIS MODERN GENERATION,

561
00:25:35,935 --> 00:25:38,004
THE SO-CALLED
YOUTH OF AMERICA...

562
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:39,338
- ONE SPADE.

563
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:40,873
- PASS.

564
00:25:40,907 --> 00:25:44,143
WHERE MODERN PARENTS GO WRONG
IS THEY'VE FORGOTTEN

565
00:25:44,176 --> 00:25:45,945
THE GOOD
OLD-FASHIONED PRECEPT,

566
00:25:45,978 --> 00:25:48,881
"SPARE THE ROD
AND SPOIL THE CHILD."

567
00:25:48,915 --> 00:25:50,282
- JUDGE.

568
00:25:50,316 --> 00:25:53,285
- [mumbling]

569
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:54,721
TWO CLUBS.

570
00:25:54,754 --> 00:25:59,191
- THREE HEARTS,
JUDGE HENDERSON.

571
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:06,032
- THREE SPADES.

572
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:08,067
- HARRY.

573
00:26:19,111 --> 00:26:22,615
HARRY?
- OH, IT'S MY BID, ISN'T IT?

574
00:26:22,649 --> 00:26:24,250
I PASS.

575
00:26:24,283 --> 00:26:25,618
- PASS.

576
00:26:25,652 --> 00:26:28,721
- THREE NO-TRUMP.

577
00:26:28,755 --> 00:26:32,124
- AS I WAS SAYING,
IN ALL THE 32 YEARS

578
00:26:32,158 --> 00:26:34,994
I SPENT ON THE BENCH,
THERE NEVER WAS

579
00:26:35,027 --> 00:26:37,129
A WAYWARD BOY OR GIRL
BROUGHT BEFORE ME

580
00:26:37,163 --> 00:26:39,999
THAT I COULDN'T
TRACK THE CAUSE

581
00:26:40,032 --> 00:26:44,837
TO SOME MISERABLE, INEPT,
SLACK-HANDED PARENTS.

582
00:26:44,871 --> 00:26:48,407
HOW SAY YOU, WILLARD?

583
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,910
- UH, GUILTY.
[laughs]

584
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:54,013
I MEAN, UH, I-I PASS.

585
00:26:54,046 --> 00:26:55,915
- HOW MANY CHILDREN
DID YOU SAY YOU HAVE, JUDGE?

586
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:59,051
- I'M SORRY TO SAY,
MRS. WILLARD,

587
00:26:59,085 --> 00:27:02,755
WE HAVE NEITHER
CHICK NOR CHILD.

588
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:03,756
DOUBLE.

589
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,958
- RE-DOUBLE.

590
00:27:05,992 --> 00:27:09,962
- I THINK I'LL GO OUT
AND STRETCH MY LEGS.

591
00:27:09,996 --> 00:27:14,200
I'M A LITTLE TWINGEY
FROM THAT WORKOUT TODAY.

592
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:17,970
- YOU KNOW WHAT THE TROUBLE
WITH MOST PEOPLE IS?

593
00:27:18,004 --> 00:27:20,172
THEY CAN'T DISTINGUISH
BETWEEN SHIPBOARD ROMANCE

594
00:27:20,206 --> 00:27:21,874
AND THE REAL THING.

595
00:27:21,908 --> 00:27:23,910
NOW, AS FOR MYSELF...

596
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,983
- MRS. WILLARD.

597
00:27:31,017 --> 00:27:33,085
- OH.
OH, YES.

598
00:28:15,094 --> 00:28:17,463
- 200 FOR DOUBLED.
YOU RE-DOUBLED.

599
00:28:17,496 --> 00:28:18,931
- RE-DOUBLED.
- KATIE.

600
00:28:18,965 --> 00:28:20,066
- OH, HARRY,
WE WON RE-DOUBLED.

601
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:21,400
- FINE, NOW LET'S TURN IN.

602
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:22,401
- WELL, WHAT'S THE HURRY?
IT'S SO EARLY.

603
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:23,369
- KATIE, WE'RE GOING.

604
00:28:23,402 --> 00:28:25,137
GOOD NIGHT, JUDGE HENDERSON,
MRS. HENDERSON.

605
00:28:25,171 --> 00:28:28,040
- GOOD NIGHT.
- GOOD NIGHT.

606
00:28:28,074 --> 00:28:30,276
- FORCEFUL DEVIL.

607
00:28:32,011 --> 00:28:33,980
- WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?

608
00:28:34,013 --> 00:28:36,448
WHAT IN THE WORLD'S
COME OVER YOU?

609
00:28:36,482 --> 00:28:39,986
- KATIE, WHAT HAVE YOU TOLD
AMY ABOUT THINGS?

610
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:41,120
- THINGS?

611
00:28:41,153 --> 00:28:43,022
- YES, YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT--

612
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:44,891
THINGS.

613
00:28:44,924 --> 00:28:45,958
- OH.

614
00:28:45,992 --> 00:28:48,160
WELL, I'VE ALWAYS ANSWERED
EVERY QUESTION HONESTLY,

615
00:28:48,194 --> 00:28:49,762
OR AS HONESTLY
AS I COULD.

616
00:28:49,796 --> 00:28:51,998
- BUT WHAT HAS SHE ASKED YOU?

617
00:28:52,031 --> 00:28:56,068
- OH, SHE'S ASKED ME...

618
00:28:56,102 --> 00:28:59,038
- WHAT HAS SHE ASKED YOU?

619
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:00,206
- SKIPPER'S STILL AWAKE,

620
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:02,775
AND HE'S GOT EARS
LIKE A FOX, YOU KNOW.

621
00:29:02,809 --> 00:29:05,878
- KATIE, WILL YOU PLEASE
STOP STALLING?

622
00:29:05,912 --> 00:29:08,314
- OH, I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE GETTING AT.

623
00:29:08,347 --> 00:29:10,416
INCIDENTALLY, HAVE YOU DISCUSSED
THINGS WITH ELLIOTT?

624
00:29:10,449 --> 00:29:13,152
- ELLIOTT IS ANOTHER SUB--
- SHH!

625
00:29:13,185 --> 00:29:14,520
- HE'S ANOTHER
SUBJECT ENTIRELY.

626
00:29:14,553 --> 00:29:16,022
- WELL, IF YOU ASK ME
ELLIOTT NEEDS

627
00:29:16,055 --> 00:29:17,990
A LOT MORE HELP
THAN AMY.

628
00:29:18,024 --> 00:29:20,927
DID YOU SEE HIM TONIGHT?

629
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,795
- OH.

630
00:29:22,829 --> 00:29:24,931
THERE'S JUST SOMETHING
ABOUT THAT NICK O'MARA

631
00:29:24,964 --> 00:29:27,199
THAT RAISES MY HACKLES.

632
00:29:27,233 --> 00:29:29,335
HE ADMITS HE WENT TO YALE.

633
00:29:29,368 --> 00:29:30,937
- NOW, HARRY.
- I KNOW.

634
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:34,006
SOME OF THE SWEETEST BOYS
YOU KNEW WENT TO YALE.

635
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,342
- AMY CAN TAKE CARE OF HERSELF.
- YEAH.

636
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:38,177
AND I THOUGHT THE ONLY THING
WE HAD TO WORRY ABOUT

637
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:42,148
ON THIS TRIP WAS TO MAKE SURE
EVERYBODY DRANK BOTTLED WATER.

638
00:29:42,181 --> 00:29:44,150
- WELL, IF YOU PROMISE
NOT TO MENTION IT AGAIN,

639
00:29:44,183 --> 00:29:45,818
I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING
THAT AMY TOLD ME

640
00:29:45,852 --> 00:29:47,453
NOT THREE MONTHS AGO.

641
00:29:47,486 --> 00:29:48,454
- WHAT DID SHE TELL YOU?

642
00:29:48,487 --> 00:29:50,422
- SHE SAID THAT
SHE HAD NEVER MET A YOUNG MAN

643
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:53,059
WHO STIRRED HER UP.
- WELL, IS THAT BAD?

644
00:29:53,092 --> 00:29:55,061
- WELL, I WAS BEGINNING
TO WORRY ABOUT IT.

645
00:29:55,094 --> 00:29:56,262
- TO WORRY?

646
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:58,030
- YOU DON'T THINK WE'VE BEEN
TOO STRICT WITH HER, DO YOU?

647
00:29:58,064 --> 00:29:59,598
- I DO NOT.
- WILL YOU STOP BARKING?

648
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:00,833
- I'M SORRY.

649
00:30:00,867 --> 00:30:03,202
- I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU HAVE
TO START PICKING ON POOR AMY.

650
00:30:03,235 --> 00:30:07,940
I COULD UNDERSTAND
YOUR CONCERN ABOUT ELLIOTT.

651
00:30:07,974 --> 00:30:10,442
DARLING, YOU'RE GETTING
ALL WORKED UP OVER NOTHING.

652
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:12,044
- OVER NOTHING?

653
00:30:12,078 --> 00:30:13,145
- I THINK YOU'RE
A TEENY BIT TIRED

654
00:30:13,179 --> 00:30:15,147
FROM ALL THE THINGS
YOU'VE BEEN DOING WITH SKIPPER.

655
00:30:15,181 --> 00:30:16,482
- A TEENY BIT TIRED?

656
00:30:16,515 --> 00:30:18,084
A TEENY BIT TIRED!

657
00:30:18,117 --> 00:30:20,019
KATIE, I DON'T KNOW WHY I SHOULD
TRY TO HIDE IT FROM YOU.

658
00:30:20,052 --> 00:30:22,154
I HAVE NEVER BEEN
SO EXHAUSTED IN MY LIFE.

659
00:30:22,188 --> 00:30:23,956
I ACHE IN EVERY BONE
IN MY BODY,

660
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:26,225
FROM THE SCALP OF MY HEAD
TO THE SOLES OF MY FEET.

661
00:30:26,258 --> 00:30:28,027
- WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU
SAY SO IN THE FIRST PLACE?

662
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:31,597
COME ON.
- HMM?

663
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:36,035
OH.

664
00:30:36,068 --> 00:30:38,304
THANK YOU.

665
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:42,875
OH, THAT'S GOOD.

666
00:30:42,909 --> 00:30:45,044
KATIE.
- HMM?

667
00:30:45,077 --> 00:30:46,879
- DID YOU EVER READ
STATE FAIR,

668
00:30:46,913 --> 00:30:48,214
YOU KNOW, THE BOOK?

669
00:30:48,247 --> 00:30:50,549
- YOU JUST RELAX.

670
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:53,085
- IT'S ABOUT A FAMILY.

671
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:55,354
ALL THEY DID WAS GO
TO A STATE FAIR.

672
00:30:55,387 --> 00:30:58,958
THE KIDS GOT ALL TANGLED UP
IN LOVE AFFAIRS.

673
00:30:58,991 --> 00:31:00,492
- NOW DON'T START
IMAGINING THINGS.

674
00:31:00,526 --> 00:31:06,966
- THAT WAS JUST A PLAIN,
ORDINARY IOWA STATE FAIR.

675
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:11,603
HERE WE ARE ON OUR WAY
TO EUROPE.

676
00:31:11,637 --> 00:31:14,941
BOY, OH, BOY,
OH, BOY, OH, BOY.

677
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,612
- HARRY, I LOVE YOU.

678
00:31:20,646 --> 00:31:23,950
SOMETIMES I THINK
IT'S A MIRACLE, YOU AND I.

679
00:31:23,983 --> 00:31:25,217
I HONESTLY DO.

680
00:31:47,974 --> 00:31:50,509
HARRY.
- [snores]

681
00:31:50,542 --> 00:31:54,646
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
WHAT?

682
00:31:59,385 --> 00:32:01,220
- HI, MOM!
- SHH!

683
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:03,489
- WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH POP?
- NOTHING, DARLING.

684
00:32:03,522 --> 00:32:05,091
BUT IT'S OUR LAST
FULL DAY OUT.

685
00:32:05,124 --> 00:32:06,325
MAYBE WE OUGHT TO LET
HIM RELAX.

686
00:32:06,358 --> 00:32:09,428
- YOU MEAN I DON'T HAVE TO PLAY
WITH HIM TODAY?

687
00:32:09,461 --> 00:32:11,964
- NO.
- YIPPEE!

688
00:32:11,998 --> 00:32:13,032
YIPPEE!

689
00:32:13,065 --> 00:32:14,566
LET'S GO!

690
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,502
- OH, I M-MUST HAVE DOZED OFF.

691
00:32:16,535 --> 00:32:17,736
I'VE GOT TO GO
AND PLAY WITH SKIPPER.

692
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:18,837
- WELL, HARRY,
SKIPPER DIDN'T WANT ME

693
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:21,307
TO TELL YOU THIS, BUT YOU'VE
WORN HIM OUT COMPLETELY

694
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,508
THE LAST FEW DAYS.

695
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:23,575
- WHAT?

696
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:25,577
- WELL, YOU SEEMED TO BE HAVING
SUCH A GOOD TIME,

697
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:27,079
HE DIDN'T WANT
TO SPOIL YOUR FUN.

698
00:32:27,113 --> 00:32:28,514
- [chuckles]
THAT'S GREAT.

699
00:32:28,547 --> 00:32:31,050
I DIDN'T STOP BECAUSE
I DIDN'T WANT TO SPOIL HIS FUN.

700
00:32:31,083 --> 00:32:33,119
- SKIPPER MUST LOVE YOU
VERY MUCH

701
00:32:33,152 --> 00:32:34,720
TO LET YOU RUN HIM AROUND
LIKE THAT.

702
00:32:34,753 --> 00:32:38,324
- [chuckles]
OH!

703
00:32:38,357 --> 00:32:40,159
WELL?

704
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:42,161
- WELL, I HAVEN'T GOTTEN
TO THAT PART YET.

705
00:32:42,194 --> 00:32:45,531
- AH, YOU WILL.

706
00:32:52,738 --> 00:32:54,173
- OH, GOOD MORNING, SIR.

707
00:32:54,206 --> 00:32:55,241
- OH, GOOD MORNING.

708
00:32:55,274 --> 00:32:56,375
- MAY I HELP YOU?

709
00:32:56,408 --> 00:32:57,376
- UH, I'D LIKE SOMETHING
IN THE WAY

710
00:32:57,409 --> 00:32:58,744
OF A MYSTERY, I GUESS.

711
00:32:58,777 --> 00:33:00,246
I'D LIKE TO READ ABOUT
SOMEBODY ELSE'S TROUBLES

712
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:01,380
FOR A CHANGE.
- [chuckles]

713
00:33:01,413 --> 00:33:02,581
VERY GOOD, SIR.

714
00:33:02,614 --> 00:33:04,183
WE HAVE ANY NUMBER
OF STIMULATING ITEMS

715
00:33:04,216 --> 00:33:05,317
IN THAT CATEGORY.

716
00:33:05,351 --> 00:33:09,388
I RATHER LEAN TOWARD THE
INTELLECTUAL-TYPE CRIME, MYSELF.

717
00:33:09,421 --> 00:33:10,722
NOW, IF YOU'LL ALLOW ME
TO SUGGEST--

718
00:33:10,756 --> 00:33:13,125
- WELL, I'LL FIND SOMETHING.
THANKS VERY MUCH.

719
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:15,061
- WELL, JUST AS YOU SAY, SIR.

720
00:33:15,094 --> 00:33:17,363
OH, AND, UH, GOOD HUNTING.
- THANK YOU.

721
00:33:20,532 --> 00:33:22,634
- OH, GOOD MORNING, DADDY.

722
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:25,437
- WELL, HI, SWEETHEART.

723
00:33:25,471 --> 00:33:26,638
WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
STUDYING?

724
00:33:26,672 --> 00:33:30,309
- MM-MM.
- OH.

725
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:32,744
YOU'RE, UH, SUDDENLY INTERESTED
IN ARCHITECTURE, HMM?

726
00:33:32,778 --> 00:33:34,380
- MM-HMM.

727
00:33:34,413 --> 00:33:36,382
YOU KNOW, DADDY,
YOU'VE GOT A LOT IN COMMON,

728
00:33:36,415 --> 00:33:37,716
YOU AND NICK.

729
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:39,051
- HOW DO YOU MEAN?

730
00:33:39,085 --> 00:33:40,719
- WELL, NICK'S BEING
AN ARCHITECT,

731
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:44,523
AND YOUR BEING, WELL,
SORT OF A BUILDER.

732
00:33:44,556 --> 00:33:46,725
- HONEY,
I'M A PLUMBING CONTRACTOR.

733
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:48,660
- WELL, YOU WORK
WITH ARCHITECTS.

734
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:51,797
- WELL, THAT'S TRUE.

735
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:54,133
- DADDY, SIT DOWN.

736
00:33:55,834 --> 00:33:58,470
WHAT DO YOU REALLY THINK
OF NICK?

737
00:33:58,504 --> 00:34:01,107
- WELL--
- YOU LIKE HIM, DON'T YOU?

738
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,642
- WELL, YES.
- YOU DO?

739
00:34:03,675 --> 00:34:06,178
I WISH I COULD SAY
THE SAME FOR NICK.

740
00:34:06,212 --> 00:34:08,714
HE DOESN'T LIKE YOU AT ALL.

741
00:34:08,747 --> 00:34:09,648
- WELL, WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

742
00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:12,618
- OH, OH, NOT YOU
SPECIFICALLY, I GUESS,

743
00:34:12,651 --> 00:34:13,852
ONLY PEOPLE LIKE YOU--

744
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:17,089
SORT OF DULL, RESPECTABLE PEOPLE
WITH FAMILIES AND SO FORTH.

745
00:34:17,123 --> 00:34:20,759
- OH, I SEE.
- HE SAYS THAT--LET IT RIDE.

746
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:23,229
- NO, GO ON,
I'M SLIGHTLY INTERESTED.

747
00:34:23,262 --> 00:34:26,865
- WELL, NICK SAYS THAT EITHER
PEOPLE ARE HYPOCRITES,

748
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,867
JUST PRETENDING TO BE HAPPY
AND ALL THAT,

749
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,237
OR ELSE, NICK SAYS,
THEY'RE DELUDING THEMSELVES,

750
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:33,272
AND THAT'S EVEN WORSE.

751
00:34:33,305 --> 00:34:36,508
- WELL, HE'S CERTAINLY
A SUNNY CHARACTER.

752
00:34:36,542 --> 00:34:39,478
- YOU HAVE TO KNOW NICK
TO UNDERSTAND HIM.

753
00:34:39,511 --> 00:34:42,114
- NO, THANKS.

754
00:34:42,148 --> 00:34:43,782
- I KNEW IT.

755
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:45,117
I KNEW YOU HATED HIM.

756
00:34:45,151 --> 00:34:46,452
- I DIDN'T SAY--

757
00:34:46,485 --> 00:34:48,254
- YOU JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND,
THAT'S ALL.

758
00:34:48,287 --> 00:34:49,888
HIS FATHER JUST
GIVES HIM MONEY

759
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:52,858
AND THEN PUSHES HIM OFF,
AND HIS MOTHER'S EVEN WORSE--

760
00:34:52,891 --> 00:34:55,394
DIVORCED TWICE
AND MARRIED THREE TIMES.

761
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:59,231
AND YET NICK WON'T SAY A WORD
AGAINST EITHER OF THEM.

762
00:34:59,265 --> 00:35:01,467
- BUT HE DOES ADMIT
HE'S NOT CRAZY ABOUT ME.

763
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:04,503
- NICK'S A LONELY BOY, POP,

764
00:35:04,536 --> 00:35:06,205
EVEN IF
YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT,

765
00:35:06,238 --> 00:35:09,908
SINCE WE'VE ALL BEEN SO LUCKY
IN OUR FAMILY.

766
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:13,345
SOMETIMES NICK
JUST BREAKS MY HEART.

767
00:35:13,379 --> 00:35:14,813
I WISH I'D NEVER MET HIM.

768
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:18,784
AND THAT'S TRUE.

769
00:35:18,817 --> 00:35:22,254
- DID YOU FIND
YOUR MYSTERY, SIR?

770
00:35:22,288 --> 00:35:24,623
- YES.

771
00:35:24,656 --> 00:35:26,458
IT'S CALLED "THE CASE
OF THE PUZZLED PARENT

772
00:35:26,492 --> 00:35:27,626
"WHO CAN'T UNDERSTAND
WHY HIS CHILDREN

773
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:32,264
KEEP SAYING
HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND."

774
00:35:32,298 --> 00:35:34,766
- HMM.

775
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,768
THAT'S AN ODD-ISH TITLE.

776
00:35:46,245 --> 00:35:47,313
- HEY.

777
00:35:47,346 --> 00:35:49,515
- DID YOU PAY ENOUGH RANSOM
TO GET US OFF THE SHIP?

778
00:35:49,548 --> 00:35:50,949
- WELL, I TIPPED
THE ROOM STEWARD,

779
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:51,883
THE DINING-ROOM STEWARD,
THE DECK STEWARD,

780
00:35:51,917 --> 00:35:53,519
THE GYM INSTRUCTOR,
AND SEVERAL OTHERS.

781
00:35:53,552 --> 00:35:55,687
IF ANYONE SMILED AT ME,
I-I HANDED THEM MONEY.

782
00:35:55,721 --> 00:35:57,423
- [laughs]
BUT IT WAS WORTH IT.

783
00:35:57,456 --> 00:35:59,391
[speaking French]

784
00:35:59,425 --> 00:36:01,227
NOT A PICTURE
IN A GIRDLE AD,

785
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,694
NOT A MOVIE
IN GLORIOUS TECHNICOLOR,

786
00:36:02,728 --> 00:36:06,532
BUT THE REAL GENUINE ARTICLE.

787
00:36:06,565 --> 00:36:09,235
- AND WHO IS THAT
LONE, TRAGIC FIGURE?

788
00:36:10,302 --> 00:36:11,737
- ELLIOTT ISN'T HAPPY
THIS MORNING.

789
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:13,472
- SHARMA'S BEEN LOCKED
IN HER CABIN BY HER FATHER.

790
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:14,773
HE COULDN'T EVEN
SAY GOOD-BYE TO HER.

791
00:36:14,806 --> 00:36:16,208
- WELL, THAT'S NOT
A BAD WAY TO HANDLE

792
00:36:16,242 --> 00:36:17,743
A GIRL THAT AGE, EITHER.

793
00:36:17,776 --> 00:36:20,812
STILL, IN ALL, I DON'T THINK
IT WOULD WORK WITH AMY, DO YOU?

794
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:23,949
- WELL, I'D LIKE
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT AMY.

795
00:36:23,982 --> 00:36:24,783
- WELL, I'M LISTENING.

796
00:36:24,816 --> 00:36:26,685
- WE PROMISED
WE'D TELL EACH OTHER

797
00:36:26,718 --> 00:36:27,919
EVERYTHING
ABOUT THE CHILDREN, RIGHT?

798
00:36:27,953 --> 00:36:29,488
- THAT'S RIGHT.

799
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:31,390
- WELL, THIS IS
THE KIND OF A THING

800
00:36:31,423 --> 00:36:32,824
A GIRL REALLY COULDN'T TELL
HER FATHER.

801
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:34,360
IT'S SOMETHING THAT SHE
WOULD HAVE TO DISCUSS

802
00:36:34,393 --> 00:36:35,427
WITH ANOTHER WOMAN.

803
00:36:35,461 --> 00:36:37,929
- OH.
WELL, GO ON.

804
00:36:37,963 --> 00:36:39,431
- WELL, YOU PROMISE
NOT TO GET ALL WROUGHT UP?

805
00:36:39,465 --> 00:36:42,834
- I WILL NOT
GET ALL WROUGHT UP.

806
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:43,835
- OKAY.

807
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:44,803
- KATIE, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE,

808
00:36:44,836 --> 00:36:47,005
IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING
TO TELL ME, TELL ME.

809
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:50,676
- HEY, POP!

810
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:51,910
THE BOAT'S GOING TO DOCK SOON!

811
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:53,945
- YES, WELL,
RUN ALONG FOR A FEW MINUTES,

812
00:36:53,979 --> 00:36:54,946
WILL YOU, SKIPPER?

813
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,782
YOUR MOTHER AND I
ARE DISCUSSING SOMETHING.

814
00:36:56,815 --> 00:36:59,518
- WELL, HURRY UP, HUH?
- YES, WE WILL.

815
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:00,619
WELL, KATIE?

816
00:37:00,652 --> 00:37:02,754
- WELL, SKIPPER'S RIGHT.
THIS COULD WAIT UNTIL LATER.

817
00:37:02,788 --> 00:37:04,490
- KATIE, I AM NOT STIRRING
FROM THIS SPOT

818
00:37:04,523 --> 00:37:06,692
UNTIL YOU TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED.

819
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:09,895
- WELL, AMY TOLD ME
SHE DISCOVERED

820
00:37:09,928 --> 00:37:11,897
SHE HAD A WARM-BLOODED NATURE
AFTER ALL.

821
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:13,965
- WELL, WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

822
00:37:13,999 --> 00:37:15,834
AND WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"AFTER ALL"?

823
00:37:15,867 --> 00:37:18,704
- I DIDN'T KNOW THIS,
BUT ALL THIS TIME,

824
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:20,672
WHEN AMY WAS GOING AROUND
WITH THOSE BOYS BACK HOME,

825
00:37:20,706 --> 00:37:23,575
SHE--I'M AFRAID
SHE HAD THE REPUTATION

826
00:37:23,609 --> 00:37:25,311
OF BEING SORT OF A COLD FISH.

827
00:37:25,344 --> 00:37:26,612
- NOW, LOOK HERE, KATIE--

828
00:37:26,645 --> 00:37:27,679
- WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS

829
00:37:27,713 --> 00:37:29,481
AMY FOUND OUT,
TO RESPOND TO A BOY,

830
00:37:29,515 --> 00:37:32,284
SHE HAD TO HAVE
SOME GENUINE FEELING FOR HIM,

831
00:37:32,318 --> 00:37:34,286
LIKE NICK O'MARA.

832
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,921
WELL, I THINK THAT'S QUITE
AN ACCOMPLISHMENT,

833
00:37:35,954 --> 00:37:37,356
FINDING OUT SOMETHING
LIKE THAT.

834
00:37:37,389 --> 00:37:38,957
- SURE, IT'S QUITE
AN ACCOMPLISHMENT

835
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:40,025
FOR THAT PUNK O'MARA.

836
00:37:40,058 --> 00:37:41,827
I'M GOING TO FIND HIM AND--
- HARRY.

837
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,629
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
- NOW, DON'T YOU START.

838
00:37:43,662 --> 00:37:44,896
- BUT DON'T YOU SEE
IT'S IMPORTANT

839
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:46,432
THAT AMY'S FOUND OUT
SHE'S A VITAL,

840
00:37:46,465 --> 00:37:47,966
WARM-BLOODED YOUNG WOMAN?

841
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:49,435
AREN'T YOU GLAD?

842
00:37:49,468 --> 00:37:50,969
- GLAD?

843
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:52,704
- BUT I THINK THE BOY
HAS HER A LITTLE PUZZLED.

844
00:37:52,738 --> 00:37:54,039
- WELL, I'LL TELL YOU
ONE THING.

845
00:37:54,072 --> 00:37:57,709
HE DOESN'T HAVE ME PUZZLED.
- WELL, NOW, WAIT.

846
00:38:03,349 --> 00:38:05,384
- I THINK I'LL HAVE
A LITTLE TALK WITH MR. O'MARA.

847
00:38:05,417 --> 00:38:06,718
- HARRY WILLARD,
YOU LISTEN TO ME.

848
00:38:06,752 --> 00:38:07,953
NOW, DON'T YOU GO JUMPING IN

849
00:38:07,986 --> 00:38:09,555
WITH YOUR
TWO BIG GALUMPHING FEET

850
00:38:09,588 --> 00:38:10,956
AND DRAMATIZE THE SITUATION.

851
00:38:10,989 --> 00:38:12,057
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

852
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:13,559
- WELL, WE HAVE TO TRUST AMY.

853
00:38:13,592 --> 00:38:14,760
AMY WOULDN'T LET
ANYTHING HAPPEN,

854
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:16,895
AND SHE DIDN'T THINK NICK WANTED
ANYTHING TO HAPPEN EITHER.

855
00:38:16,928 --> 00:38:18,530
- OH, HE DIDN'T, HUH?

856
00:38:18,564 --> 00:38:19,931
- WELL, THAT'S WHY
THEY'VE BEEN SO QUIET TODAY--

857
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:22,568
JUST WALKING AROUND
NOT SAYING A WORD.

858
00:38:22,601 --> 00:38:23,969
IT'S KIND OF SAD AND TOUCHING.

859
00:38:24,002 --> 00:38:26,071
- TOUCHING?
- CERTAINLY.

860
00:38:26,104 --> 00:38:27,973
AMY TOLD ME THAT THE BOY
IS SO MIXED UP,

861
00:38:28,006 --> 00:38:29,975
HE DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT HE WANTS OUT OF LIFE.

862
00:38:30,008 --> 00:38:32,043
HE DOESN'T BELIEVE IN MARRIAGE,
FOR ONE THING.

863
00:38:32,077 --> 00:38:33,111
- OH, SOME SURPRISE.

864
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,846
- OH, I FEEL
KIND OF SORRY FOR HIM.

865
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,682
AND SO DOES AMY.
- OH.

866
00:38:36,715 --> 00:38:38,517
- MAYBE THAT'S WHAT THE WHOLE
THING AMOUNTS TO--PITY.

867
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:39,718
- OH, SURE.

868
00:38:39,751 --> 00:38:40,819
- WELL, THEY'RE SAYING
GOOD-BYE NOW,

869
00:38:40,852 --> 00:38:42,521
AND THAT'LL BE
THE END OF IT.

870
00:38:42,554 --> 00:38:43,655
- THE END OF IT?

871
00:38:43,689 --> 00:38:44,856
- YES, NICK'S GOING
ON TO LONDON.

872
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:45,991
- TO LONDON?

873
00:38:46,024 --> 00:38:46,958
WELL, FOR PETE'S SAKE, KATIE.

874
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:48,827
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

875
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:49,761
WHAT ARE WE WORRYING ABOUT?

876
00:38:49,795 --> 00:38:51,963
AMY WILL SNAP OUT OF IT
ONCE WE HIT PARIS.

877
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:54,065
COME ON, LET'S GET OFF THIS.

878
00:39:38,444 --> 00:39:40,979
- OH, WHAT A BEAUTIFUL CITY.

879
00:39:41,012 --> 00:39:44,082
- YOU MEAN WHAT A BEAUTIFUL
TOMATO PATCH.

880
00:39:46,752 --> 00:39:51,823
I HAVE A FEELING THAT MY LIFE
IS JUST ABOUT TO BEGIN.

881
00:39:51,857 --> 00:39:53,124
[whistle blows]

882
00:39:53,158 --> 00:39:56,862
[tires screech]

883
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:58,830
- GOLLY...

884
00:39:58,864 --> 00:40:00,065
YOU MISSED HIM.

885
00:40:00,098 --> 00:40:01,667
- DON'T WORRY
ABOUT THE TRAFFIC, DARLING.

886
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,934
JUST PRETEND
YOU'RE ON THE ROLLER COASTER

887
00:40:02,968 --> 00:40:03,869
BACK HOME
AT INDIAN LAKE.

888
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:04,936
HAVE FUN.

889
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:09,007
- OKAY, I'M HAVING FUN.

890
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,477
DRIVER, YOU'VE GOT A BEAUTIFUL
CITY HERE, ALL RIGHT.

891
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:13,078
- MM-HMM.

892
00:40:13,111 --> 00:40:15,581
- IT'S JUST AN IDEA, BUT MAYBE
IF YOU SLOWED DOWN A LITTLE,

893
00:40:15,614 --> 00:40:16,715
WE COULD SEE IT BETTER.

894
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:19,651
- [speaking French]

895
00:40:19,685 --> 00:40:21,987
- WHAT'S THE FRENCH WORD
FOR "SLOW DOWN"?

896
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:22,854
- HARRY, LOOK AT IT NOW.

897
00:40:22,888 --> 00:40:25,090
ISN'T IT MAGNIFICENT?

898
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:37,869
[horn honks, tires screech]

899
00:40:37,903 --> 00:40:39,070
- I GOT TO HAND IT TO YOU.

900
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:42,007
YOU SURE HANDLE
THIS LITTLE, UH, THING.

901
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,543
[horn honks]
LOOK OUT!

902
00:40:44,576 --> 00:40:46,945
[tires screeching]

903
00:40:46,978 --> 00:40:49,881
LOOK, LET'S TAKE IT
A LITTLE EASY, COULD WE?

904
00:40:49,915 --> 00:40:51,883
- [speaking French]

905
00:40:51,917 --> 00:40:54,986
- OUI, OUI, OUI, OUI.
WHAT DID HE SAY?

906
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:57,222
- HE'S SAYING SOMETHING
ABOUT DON'T POINT,

907
00:40:57,255 --> 00:40:58,056
IT MAKES HIM NERVOUS.

908
00:40:58,089 --> 00:41:01,126
- OH, IT MAKES HIM NERVOUS?

909
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:04,863
HEY, THERE'S SOME PEOPLE.

910
00:41:04,896 --> 00:41:06,598
LOOK OUT!
[horn honking]

911
00:41:06,632 --> 00:41:08,767
[tires screech]

912
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:20,679
[tires screech]

913
00:41:20,712 --> 00:41:23,014
- VOILA, MONSIEUR.

914
00:41:37,896 --> 00:41:39,931
- [speaking French]

915
00:41:39,965 --> 00:41:41,867
- OUI, MADAME.

916
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,201
- THANKS, POP.

917
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:45,070
- AMY, YOU SHOULD LOOK
AFTER YOUR LUGGAGE, DEAR.

918
00:41:45,103 --> 00:41:46,004
- I DON'T KNOW WHY
YOU KIDS COULDN'T WAIT

919
00:41:46,037 --> 00:41:47,873
FOR YOUR ALLOWANCE
UNTIL WE'VE AT LEAST HAD

920
00:41:47,906 --> 00:41:49,140
A LOOK AROUND HERE.

921
00:41:49,174 --> 00:41:50,609
THERE YOU ARE, SKIPPER.

922
00:41:50,642 --> 00:41:52,010
- WHAT'S THIS?

923
00:41:52,043 --> 00:41:52,978
- WELL, THAT'S TEN FRANCS.

924
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:55,013
THAT'S, UH, TWO DOLLARS
IN OUR MONEY, OKAY?

925
00:41:55,046 --> 00:41:57,082
- OH, THANKS, POP.
- NEXT.

926
00:41:57,115 --> 00:41:59,017
- WHAT A SWEET
OLD-FASHIONED HOTEL.

927
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:00,151
DON'T YOU LOVE IT?

928
00:42:00,185 --> 00:42:01,887
WELL, AS SOON
AS WE GET SETTLED

929
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,622
AND I GET A GOOD HOT BATH,
I'M GOING TO LOVE EVERYTHING.

930
00:42:03,655 --> 00:42:06,758
- IT SMELLS LIKE SOMEONE'S BEEN
SHOEING A HORSE IN HERE.

931
00:42:10,128 --> 00:42:11,697
- THAT'S AGE, DARLING.

932
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:13,699
IT'S WHAT THE ARTISTS
CALL PATINA--

933
00:42:13,732 --> 00:42:15,967
OLD WOOD, OLD DRAPES,
OLD CARPETS,

934
00:42:16,001 --> 00:42:18,003
AND WONDERFUL OLD
ROMANTIC GHOSTS.

935
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:19,605
- I THINK IT'S GREAT,

936
00:42:19,638 --> 00:42:20,538
WHICH INCIDENTALLY,
IT SHOULD BE,

937
00:42:20,572 --> 00:42:22,841
BECAUSE THE RATES ARE MURDER.
- [laughs]

938
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:24,876
[water whooshing loudly]
- HEY!

939
00:42:26,712 --> 00:42:27,478
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

940
00:42:27,512 --> 00:42:29,080
- THAT THING IN THERE--
IT GOT ME!

941
00:42:29,114 --> 00:42:30,181
- WHAT THING?

942
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:32,350
- HOW COME THERE ARE TWO JOHNS
IN THE JOHN, ANYWAY?

943
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:33,985
- WHAT?

944
00:42:34,019 --> 00:42:35,887
- THERE'S TWO--
- NEVER MIND, SKIPPER.

945
00:42:35,921 --> 00:42:37,856
YOUR FATHER WILL EXPLAIN IT
TO YOU SOME OTHER TIME.

946
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:39,758
NOW GO GET YOUR SHIRT CHANGED.
- EXPLAIN WHAT?

947
00:42:39,791 --> 00:42:41,226
- IF THEY BUILT THOSE THINGS
FOR FELLOWS,

948
00:42:41,259 --> 00:42:42,994
SOMEBODY SURE DON'T KNOW
WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

949
00:42:43,028 --> 00:42:44,029
- MOM!

950
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:45,631
YOU'VE GOT TO SEE
MY BEDROOM.

951
00:42:45,664 --> 00:42:48,166
IT'S JUST FABULOUS.
- HEY!

952
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:51,002
OH.

953
00:42:51,036 --> 00:42:52,904
THERE YOU ARE.
- MERCI.

954
00:42:52,938 --> 00:42:54,139
MERCI BEAUCOUP, MONSIEUR
- THANK YOU.

955
00:42:54,172 --> 00:42:57,108
- OH, NO.

956
00:42:57,142 --> 00:42:59,778
- WELL, SUNSHINE,
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU NOW?

957
00:42:59,811 --> 00:43:01,112
- IT'S THIS HOTEL.

958
00:43:01,146 --> 00:43:03,148
- NOW, ELLIOTT, I DON'T WANT
TO HEAR ANY MORE ABOUT--

959
00:43:03,181 --> 00:43:05,817
- POP, YOU'VE MADE
A TERRIBLE MISTAKE.

960
00:43:05,851 --> 00:43:07,018
YOU KNOW, WE'RE OVER HERE
ON THE RIGHT BANK.

961
00:43:07,052 --> 00:43:07,886
- THE RIGHT BANK?

962
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:09,988
- WE OUGHT TO BE OVER
ON THE LEFT BANK

963
00:43:10,021 --> 00:43:11,022
WHERE ALL
THE INTERESTING PEOPLE ARE.

964
00:43:11,056 --> 00:43:12,257
THAT'S WHERE THE ACTION IS.

965
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:14,960
- RIGHT BANK OR LEFT BANK--WHAT
DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE, EL?

966
00:43:14,993 --> 00:43:17,295
- OH, DON'T YOU
UNDERSTAND, DAD?

967
00:43:17,328 --> 00:43:19,030
WELL, YOU'VE GOT US HERE
WITH A BUNCH OF TOURISTS.

968
00:43:19,064 --> 00:43:20,632
NEXT THING YOU KNOW,

969
00:43:20,666 --> 00:43:22,634
YOU'RE GOING TO BE DRAGGING US
OFF TO THE EIFFEL TOWER

970
00:43:22,668 --> 00:43:25,170
OR SOME CORNFLAKE ROUTINE
LIKE THAT.

971
00:43:25,203 --> 00:43:26,905
[sighs]

972
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:27,873
- LOOK, SON...

973
00:43:27,906 --> 00:43:31,409
LET'S GET SOMETHING
STRAIGHT AROUND HERE.

974
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,111
WE ARE TOURISTS.

975
00:43:33,144 --> 00:43:35,013
WE'RE NOT PLAYBOYS
OR BUSINESS TYCOONS

976
00:43:35,046 --> 00:43:37,783
OR INTERNATIONAL SPIES
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

977
00:43:37,816 --> 00:43:40,051
WE'RE JUST PLAIN TOURISTS
FROM TERRE HAUTE, INDIANA.

978
00:43:40,085 --> 00:43:41,119
- POP.

979
00:43:41,152 --> 00:43:42,053
- NOW, FOR A START,
IT MIGHT HELP

980
00:43:42,087 --> 00:43:42,988
IF WE STOP SHOWBOATING
ALL OVER THE PLACE

981
00:43:43,021 --> 00:43:45,023
AND PRETENDING WE'RE
SOMETHING WE'RE NOT.

982
00:43:45,056 --> 00:43:46,892
THEN MAYBE "TOURIST" WON'T BE
SUCH A DIRTY WORD ANYMORE.

983
00:43:46,925 --> 00:43:49,728
- WHAT GOT YOU SO WOUND--
- ELLIOTT, I--

984
00:43:49,761 --> 00:43:51,763
- LET'S TELL YOUR FATHER
AND ELLIOTT ABOUT IT.

985
00:43:51,797 --> 00:43:53,164
- HARRY, GET YOUR COAT
BACK ON.

986
00:43:53,198 --> 00:43:55,433
I'VE GOT A SENSATIONAL IDEA.

987
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:56,735
IS THERE ANYTHING WRONG?

988
00:43:56,768 --> 00:43:58,904
- NO, NO, ELLIOTT AND I
WERE JUST SAYING

989
00:43:58,937 --> 00:44:02,407
HOW MUCH WE LIKE THE HOTEL,
WEREN'T WE, ELLIOTT?

990
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:05,911
- OH, GOSH, MOM,
HOW--HOW GREAT CAN A PLACE BE?

991
00:44:05,944 --> 00:44:07,713
- FORGET ABOUT UNPACKING.
FORGET ABOUT EVERYTHING.

992
00:44:07,746 --> 00:44:09,380
THE WHOLE FAMILY IS GOING
TO THE EIFFEL TOWER,

993
00:44:09,414 --> 00:44:11,016
WHERE WE GET OUR FIRST
REAL LOOK AT PARIS.

994
00:44:11,049 --> 00:44:13,384
HOW DOES THAT SOUND?
- GREAT.

995
00:44:13,418 --> 00:44:15,854
DOESN'T IT
SOUND GREAT, ELLIOTT?

996
00:44:15,887 --> 00:44:18,189
IT OUGHT TO BE A BLAST.

997
00:44:35,206 --> 00:44:38,443
- WHAT A PERFECTLY BEAUTIFUL,
EXCITING CITY.

998
00:44:38,476 --> 00:44:41,046
- IT SURE AIN'T INDIANAPOLIS.

999
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:44,115
- OH, IT JUST GIVES ME
DUCK BUMPS.

1000
00:44:44,149 --> 00:44:46,718
LOOK, THE PALACE WHERE THE KINGS
AND QUEENS OF FRANCE

1001
00:44:46,752 --> 00:44:48,186
USED TO LIVE

1002
00:44:48,219 --> 00:44:53,158
AND THE HOTEL ON VILLE DE--
THE TOMB OF NAPOLEON.

1003
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:54,459
IT'S TOO BAD YOU'RE NOT
OLD ENOUGH TO APPRECIATE

1004
00:44:54,492 --> 00:44:55,393
ALL OF THIS.

1005
00:44:55,426 --> 00:44:58,930
- ARE YOU KIDDING?
I KNOW WHO NAPOLEON IS.

1006
00:44:58,964 --> 00:45:01,032
HE'S THE GUY WHO HAD THE SAME
TROUBLE WITH THE ENGLISH

1007
00:45:01,066 --> 00:45:03,001
THAT CUSTER DID
WITH THE INDIANS.

1008
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:05,503
- HOW HIGH
DO YOU SUPPOSE WE ARE?

1009
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:07,272
- THINK WE COULD PROMOTE POP
FOR SOMETHING TO EAT?

1010
00:45:07,305 --> 00:45:09,274
I'M STARVING.

1011
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:15,180
- TELL THE FOLKS I'LL MEET THEM
BACK AT THE HOTEL.

1012
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:19,050
- HEY, WHERE YOU GOING?

1013
00:45:19,084 --> 00:45:21,286
- WELL, MOTHER,
WE FINALLY MADE IT--

1014
00:45:21,319 --> 00:45:23,054
PARIS.

1015
00:45:23,088 --> 00:45:26,057
WE'RE ONLY ABOUT 20 YEARS
BEHIND SCHEDULE, THAT'S ALL.

1016
00:45:26,091 --> 00:45:28,526
- 20 YEARS?
WHERE DID IT GO SO FAST?

1017
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,295
- I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S HARD TO TELL.

1018
00:45:30,328 --> 00:45:32,530
THERE'S THAT FIRST
NUMBING SENSATION

1019
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,032
WHEN YOU GET MARRIED,
AND WHEN YOU COME OUT OF THAT,

1020
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:35,333
YOU NOTICE
SOME FAMILIAR-LOOKING KIDS

1021
00:45:35,366 --> 00:45:39,337
ASKING YOU
FOR THE KEYS TO THE CAR.

1022
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:42,140
- HAVE I CHANGED MUCH
IN 20 YEARS?

1023
00:45:42,173 --> 00:45:46,011
- YEAH, YOU'RE ABOUT
TWICE AS BEAUTIFUL NOW.

1024
00:45:46,044 --> 00:45:48,046
- TURN YOUR SHOULDER
A LITTLE MORE TO THE RIGHT.

1025
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,147
- ELLIOTT!

1026
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:50,916
- OKAY, NOW MOVE YOUR RIGHT
SHOULDER A LITTLE MORE.

1027
00:45:50,949 --> 00:45:52,017
NOW LIFT YOUR CHIN UP.

1028
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:53,318
YEAH, THAT'S PERFECT.

1029
00:45:53,351 --> 00:45:54,986
NOW HOLD IT JUST LIKE THAT.
DON'T MOVE AN INCH.

1030
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:56,021
- ELLIOTT!

1031
00:45:56,054 --> 00:45:58,123
ELLIOTT!
GET DOWN FROM THERE!

1032
00:45:58,156 --> 00:46:01,526
- RIGHT, DAD.
SOON AS I FINISH THIS SHOT.

1033
00:46:01,559 --> 00:46:04,062
- WELL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
UP THERE, ANYWAY?

1034
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:05,296
- I'VE GOT
A GREAT ANGLE, DAD.

1035
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:07,899
- WOULD YOU GET DOWN
FROM THERE?

1036
00:46:07,933 --> 00:46:09,334
- WILL YOU FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE
BE CAREFUL?

1037
00:46:09,367 --> 00:46:10,568
YOU CAN BREAK YOUR LEGS.

1038
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:12,437
- DON'T WORRY, MOM.
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

1039
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:15,140
- WELL, JUST DON'T DROP
THE CAMERA, THAT'S ALL.

1040
00:46:15,173 --> 00:46:16,875
DO YOU WANT TO END UP
IN THE FRENCH CLINK?

1041
00:46:16,908 --> 00:46:20,045
- DAD'S A GOOD SORT,
BUT HE DOESN'T APPROVE

1042
00:46:20,078 --> 00:46:22,013
OF THE HAZARDS I FACE
IN MY CAMERA WORK.

1043
00:46:22,047 --> 00:46:24,049
- NOW, LOOK, ELLIOTT.
- DAD, MOM...

1044
00:46:24,082 --> 00:46:26,051
I'D LIKE TO PRESENT
MISS PENELOPE--

1045
00:46:26,084 --> 00:46:28,153
- WALTHORNE.
- WALTHORNE.

1046
00:46:28,186 --> 00:46:30,055
FROM BRIGHTON, ENGLAND,
AND SHE'LL BE GRACING

1047
00:46:30,088 --> 00:46:31,156
THIS FAIR CITY
FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS.

1048
00:46:31,189 --> 00:46:33,058
- HOW DO YOU DO?

1049
00:46:33,091 --> 00:46:34,993
- HOW DO YOU DO?
- PLEASED TO MEET YOU.

1050
00:46:35,026 --> 00:46:38,529
I CONSIDER MYSELF EVER SO LUCKY
TO MEET YOUR SON.

1051
00:46:38,563 --> 00:46:40,932
- YOU DO?

1052
00:46:40,966 --> 00:46:42,267
- WELL, I'M HERE
ON A CULTURE TOUR,

1053
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:45,203
AND I WANT TO LEARN
EVERYTHING I CAN.

1054
00:46:45,236 --> 00:46:46,938
- WELL, ACTUALLY,
WE'RE ALL LEARNING.

1055
00:46:46,972 --> 00:46:51,276
- AND ELLIOTT--I MEAN,
MR. WILLARD KNOWS PARIS SO WELL.

1056
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:53,344
HE'S OFFERED TO SHOW ME
SOME NICE OUT-OF-THE-WAY PLACES

1057
00:46:53,378 --> 00:46:55,080
THE TOURISTS DON'T KNOW ABOUT.

1058
00:46:55,113 --> 00:46:56,214
- ELLIOTT KNOWS PARIS?

1059
00:46:56,247 --> 00:46:59,284
- WELL, I SUPPOSE NO ONE
EVER REALLY KNOWS PARIS, DAD,

1060
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:00,485
NOT IN THE COMPLETE SENSE.

1061
00:47:00,518 --> 00:47:02,053
- NO, I DON'T SUPPOSE
THEY EVER DO.

1062
00:47:02,087 --> 00:47:04,289
SON, I'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU.
- HARRY.

1063
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:06,424
I REALLY THINK
WE SHOULD LEAVE.

1064
00:47:06,457 --> 00:47:08,426
WE HAVE TO UNPACK
BEFORE DINNER.

1065
00:47:08,459 --> 00:47:10,095
- OH.

1066
00:47:10,128 --> 00:47:11,930
WELL, MAYBE ELLIOTT
CAN USE HIS INFLUENCE

1067
00:47:11,963 --> 00:47:14,032
TO GET US INTO ONE
OF THOSE CHARMING LITTLE BISTROS

1068
00:47:14,065 --> 00:47:15,934
OVER ON THE LEFT BANK
WHERE THEY DON'T ALLOW TOURISTS.

1069
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:17,535
DO YOU THINK YOU MIGHT BE ABLE
TO ARRANGE THAT, ELLIOTT?

1070
00:47:17,568 --> 00:47:19,237
- HEY, POP, COME HERE.

1071
00:47:26,077 --> 00:47:28,146
HAVE A LOOK.
- WHERE, SKIPPER?

1072
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:32,583
- RIGHT THERE.

1073
00:47:32,617 --> 00:47:37,088
- HEY, THAT'S AMY.
WHAT'S SHE DOING DOWN THERE?

1074
00:47:37,122 --> 00:47:39,357
NO.

1075
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:43,194
NOT THAT, NOT HIM.

1076
00:47:43,228 --> 00:47:46,364
KATIE!

1077
00:47:47,966 --> 00:47:49,968
- THE SILLIEST THING
I EVER HEARD OF--

1078
00:47:50,001 --> 00:47:51,502
CANCELING HIS TRIP
TO LONDON

1079
00:47:51,536 --> 00:47:53,004
AND THEN HIDING
ON THE BOAT TRAIN

1080
00:47:53,038 --> 00:47:55,606
ALL THE WAY TO PARIS,
SPYING ON ME!

1081
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:57,142
NOW, WHAT DID HE THINK
I WAS GOING TO DO--

1082
00:47:57,175 --> 00:48:00,078
TAKE UP WITH ANOTHER BOY
RIGHT OFF THE BAT?

1083
00:48:00,111 --> 00:48:01,446
OH, HE MAKES ME FURIOUS.

1084
00:48:01,479 --> 00:48:03,081
- WELL, NOW THAT YOU
SPEAK OF IT,

1085
00:48:03,114 --> 00:48:05,083
HE DOES HAVE AN IRRITATING
WAY ABOUT HIM.

1086
00:48:05,116 --> 00:48:07,552
IF YOU ASK ME--
- THE GREAT NICK O'MARA...

1087
00:48:07,585 --> 00:48:09,354
WHO DOES HE THINK HE IS?
- SHH.

1088
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:11,356
- WELL, WHO DOES
HE THINK HE IS?

1089
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:13,091
IF HE CAN'T START
AT THE TOP--

1090
00:48:13,124 --> 00:48:14,359
THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS
TO DO, YOU KNOW--

1091
00:48:14,392 --> 00:48:16,194
START RIGHT AT THE TOP.

1092
00:48:16,227 --> 00:48:17,963
I TOLD HIM WHY DIDN'T HE DO
LIKE OTHER BOYS

1093
00:48:17,996 --> 00:48:19,464
WHO'D JUST GRADUATED
FROM COLLEGE

1094
00:48:19,497 --> 00:48:21,166
AND GET A JOB
IN AN ARCHITECT'S OFFICE

1095
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:24,102
AND LEARN
THE PRACTICAL SIDE TOO.

1096
00:48:24,135 --> 00:48:25,236
YOU CAN'T BE AN ARCHITECT

1097
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:27,172
JUST BECAUSE
YOU CAN DRAW AND DESIGN.

1098
00:48:27,205 --> 00:48:28,473
THERE'S MORE TO IT THAN THAT,
ISN'T THAT SO?

1099
00:48:28,506 --> 00:48:29,474
- OH, OF COURSE.

1100
00:48:29,507 --> 00:48:31,609
UH, WOULD YOU GIVE ME
THE SUGAR, AMY, PLEASE?

1101
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:32,677
NOW, WHEN I FIRST GOT
INTERESTED IN PLUMBING--

1102
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:35,346
- DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE HAD
THE NERVE TO SAY TO ME?

1103
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:38,083
HE SAID, DID I EXPECT HIM
TO GET A JOB

1104
00:48:38,116 --> 00:48:39,450
SO THAT HE WOULD
HAVE TO SETTLE DOWN

1105
00:48:39,484 --> 00:48:42,020
AND BECOME AN ANONYMOUS
EIGHT-HOUR-A-DAY VEGETABLE

1106
00:48:42,053 --> 00:48:43,955
LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE?

1107
00:48:43,989 --> 00:48:45,356
BUT I TOLD HIM....

1108
00:48:45,390 --> 00:48:48,159
I SAID THAT I DIDN'T GIVE A HOOT
IF HE EVER GOT A JOB.

1109
00:48:48,193 --> 00:48:50,695
THAT ALL THAT I KNEW
WAS IF HE SAT AROUND WAITING

1110
00:48:50,728 --> 00:48:51,762
FOR PEOPLE TO COME
TO ASK HIM

1111
00:48:51,796 --> 00:48:56,067
TO BUILD THEM A HOUSE
OR AN OFFICE OR A DOGHOUSE

1112
00:48:56,101 --> 00:48:57,702
OR SOMETHING
THAT HE'D WAIT ALL HIS LIFE.

1113
00:48:57,735 --> 00:48:59,637
- OF COURSE, THAT'S THE WAY
IT IS IN ANY BUSINESS.

1114
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:00,471
NOW, YOU TAKE PLUMBING--

1115
00:49:00,505 --> 00:49:02,473
- I SAID, AS FAR
AS I WAS CONCERNED,

1116
00:49:02,507 --> 00:49:04,175
HE MIGHT AS WELL
JUST STOP MAKING

1117
00:49:04,209 --> 00:49:05,310
ALL THOSE HANDSOME DRAWINGS
OF HIS

1118
00:49:05,343 --> 00:49:07,578
AND LIVE OFF OF HIS RICH MOTHER
FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE

1119
00:49:07,612 --> 00:49:09,247
AND FORGET ABOUT BEING
ANYTHING ELSE,

1120
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,117
BECAUSE HE WAS JUST
TOO WEAK, WEAK, WEAK.

1121
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:14,319
AND I TOLD HIM ON THE BOAT TOO
THAT I DIDN'T WANT TO SEE HIM

1122
00:49:14,352 --> 00:49:16,121
IN PARIS
OR ANYWHERE ELSE.

1123
00:49:16,154 --> 00:49:19,624
AND HERE HE IS,
15 MINUTES LATE.

1124
00:49:19,657 --> 00:49:21,726
- AMY, WHERE A GIRL,

1125
00:49:21,759 --> 00:49:23,728
OR A GROWN WOMAN
FOR THAT MATTER,

1126
00:49:23,761 --> 00:49:26,231
MAKES A MISTAKE IN A THING
LIKE THIS IS WHEN SHE--

1127
00:49:26,264 --> 00:49:27,565
- OH, POP, I HATE MYSELF

1128
00:49:27,598 --> 00:49:30,101
FOR SAYING ALL THOSE
TERRIBLE THINGS ABOUT NICK.

1129
00:49:30,135 --> 00:49:32,737
HE'S REALLY NOT
LIKE THAT AT ALL.

1130
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:36,107
HE'S REALLY--WELL, HE'S
VERY GENTLE AND CONSIDERATE.

1131
00:49:36,141 --> 00:49:38,309
AND I DON'T MEAN
POLITE-CONSIDERATE EITHER.

1132
00:49:38,343 --> 00:49:40,511
I MEAN, HONESTLY CONSIDERATE.

1133
00:49:40,545 --> 00:49:42,080
AND HE'S SO ALONE.

1134
00:49:42,113 --> 00:49:43,348
- WELL, THAT'S ALL
FINE AND GOOD,

1135
00:49:43,381 --> 00:49:47,052
BUT JUST BECAUSE HE'S ALONE--
- OH, NO, IT'S NOT THAT, POP.

1136
00:49:47,085 --> 00:49:48,219
IT'S NOT PITY.

1137
00:49:48,253 --> 00:49:51,456
I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT.

1138
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:55,660
I GUESS I'M JUST
TOO SELFISH FOR THAT.

1139
00:49:55,693 --> 00:49:56,761
IT'S WHAT HE DOES TO ME.

1140
00:49:56,794 --> 00:50:00,065
- OH, YOU MEAN, UH...

1141
00:50:00,098 --> 00:50:02,167
HE--HE STIRS YOU UP.

1142
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,569
UH, YOUR MOTHER TOLD ME
ABOUT THAT.

1143
00:50:04,602 --> 00:50:07,205
- DID SHE?

1144
00:50:08,406 --> 00:50:12,510
I TOLD HER NOT TO,
BUT I GUESS I KNEW SHE WOULD.

1145
00:50:12,543 --> 00:50:15,446
YOU TWO TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING,
DON'T YOU?

1146
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,615
I MEAN, EVERYTHING.

1147
00:50:17,648 --> 00:50:18,649
THAT'S MARVELOUS.

1148
00:50:18,683 --> 00:50:22,187
THAT'S THE WAY
IT SHOULD BE.

1149
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:25,223
BUT NICK COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND
ANYTHING LIKE THAT,

1150
00:50:25,256 --> 00:50:27,225
THAT POOR-RICH-TRASH WAY
HE'S BEEN BROUGHT UP.

1151
00:50:27,258 --> 00:50:30,061
- WELL, I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT,
BUT THERE'S NO NEED--

1152
00:50:30,095 --> 00:50:32,130
- WHAT KIND OF GIRLS DO YOU
THINK HE'S KNOWN, ANYWAY?

1153
00:50:32,163 --> 00:50:34,799
THAT'S WHAT MAKES
ME SO FURIOUS.

1154
00:50:34,832 --> 00:50:39,704
HE CAN'T BELIEVE
IN ANYTHING OR ANYBODY.

1155
00:50:39,737 --> 00:50:42,373
- AMY, THIS IS JUST A THOUGHT,

1156
00:50:42,407 --> 00:50:45,376
BUT WHAT ABOUT
THE FELLOWS BACK HOME?

1157
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:47,778
YOU KNOW, BOB WHELAN
AND TIM BRADLEY.

1158
00:50:47,812 --> 00:50:49,847
THEY'RE--THEY'RE NICE KIDS.
YOU LIKE THEM.

1159
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,849
MAYBE THEY'RE--
THEY'RE NO WORLD SHAKERS,

1160
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:54,852
BUT THEY'RE NICE KIDS.
- OH, POP, DON'T RUIN IT.

1161
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:58,156
DON'T 100% PROVE
THAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

1162
00:51:00,391 --> 00:51:04,195
- I, UH--
I'M SORRY.

1163
00:51:04,229 --> 00:51:06,264
- I'M SORRY TOO.

1164
00:51:06,297 --> 00:51:07,598
I GUESS IT'S JUST SOMETHING

1165
00:51:07,632 --> 00:51:09,400
THAT I'M GOING TO HAVE
TO FIGHT THROUGH

1166
00:51:09,434 --> 00:51:12,270
BY MYSELF AND GET OVER,

1167
00:51:12,303 --> 00:51:14,605
BECAUSE THAT'S JUST
WHAT I INTEND TO DO, POP--

1168
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:15,673
GET OVER IT.

1169
00:51:15,706 --> 00:51:17,408
- GOOD.

1170
00:51:17,442 --> 00:51:19,277
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,
WHY DON'T WE START THIS MORNING?

1171
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:21,279
WE'LL ALL GO TO THE LOUVRE,
THE WHOLE FAMILY--

1172
00:51:21,312 --> 00:51:22,313
- OH, I CAN'T DO THAT, POP.

1173
00:51:22,347 --> 00:51:24,115
NICK HAS MADE
SOME RESERVATIONS

1174
00:51:24,149 --> 00:51:25,250
AT A WONDERFUL
LITTLE RESTAURANT

1175
00:51:25,283 --> 00:51:27,618
OUT NEAR VERSAILLES.

1176
00:51:27,652 --> 00:51:28,886
- OH.

1177
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:31,122
- BUT I'M NOT FALLING
IN LOVE WITH HIM, POP,

1178
00:51:31,156 --> 00:51:33,758
IF THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING.

1179
00:51:33,791 --> 00:51:36,194
I COULDN'T FALL IN LOVE
WITH A MIXED-UP TYPE LIKE THAT.

1180
00:51:36,227 --> 00:51:39,397
I'D--I'D BE ASHAMED
OF MYSELF FOR LIFE.

1181
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:42,333

1182
00:51:42,367 --> 00:51:45,536
- [speaking French]

1183
00:51:45,570 --> 00:51:48,206
MADEMOISELLE WILLARD.

1184
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:52,243
- I'LL--I'LL GET IT, AMY.

1185
00:51:52,277 --> 00:51:53,744
- [speaking French]

1186
00:51:53,778 --> 00:51:55,680
- YES?

1187
00:51:55,713 --> 00:51:57,682
YES, NICK.

1188
00:51:57,715 --> 00:52:01,686
OH, YOU'RE OUT
IN THE LOBBY.

1189
00:52:01,719 --> 00:52:04,522
NO, UH, DON'T COME IN HERE.

1190
00:52:04,555 --> 00:52:07,158
SHE'LL BE RIGHT OUT.

1191
00:52:10,661 --> 00:52:12,197
- OH, WHY'D YOU DO THAT, POP?

1192
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:13,898
- WELL, AMY, ALL YOUR LIFE,
YOUR MOTHER AND I

1193
00:52:13,931 --> 00:52:17,468
HAVE BEEN WORKING TO MAKE YOU
INTO THE KIND OF A GIRL YOU ARE.

1194
00:52:17,502 --> 00:52:18,936
I GUESS MAYBE NOW'S THE TIME
TO LEAVE YOU ALONE

1195
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:21,206
ON THE BATTLEFIELD
AND SEE HOW IT TURNS OUT.

1196
00:52:21,239 --> 00:52:22,873
- THANK YOU
FOR THE VOTE OF CONFIDENCE.

1197
00:52:22,907 --> 00:52:23,908
I'M GOING TO NEED ALL I CAN GET

1198
00:52:23,941 --> 00:52:27,545
WITH THE SESSION COMING UP
WITH THIS CHARACTER.

1199
00:52:27,578 --> 00:52:29,314
OH!

1200
00:52:33,251 --> 00:52:35,786
- HARRY, I'M SO EXCITED.
LINDSEY WELLS JUST PHONED.

1201
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:36,954
SHE'S LIVING IN PARIS NOW.
- WELL.

1202
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:38,789
- AND SHE'S JUST WIRED
TWO INVITATIONS

1203
00:52:38,823 --> 00:52:39,924
FOR THE SHOWING
OF THE NEW YORK COLLECTION.

1204
00:52:39,957 --> 00:52:41,692
- OH, WONDERFUL.
COME ON, HAVE BREAKFAST.

1205
00:52:41,726 --> 00:52:42,927
- NO, DARLING, I HAVE TO RUSH.
- YOU MEAN YOU'RE GOING TODAY?

1206
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,429
- YES, SO YOU SIT DOWN
AND HAVE YOUR BREAKFAST.

1207
00:52:44,462 --> 00:52:45,596
- WHAT ABOUT OUR PLANS
TO GO TO THE LOUVRE?

1208
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:46,797
- BUT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

1209
00:52:46,831 --> 00:52:48,266
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO GET
AN INVITATION TO THAT SHOWING.

1210
00:52:48,299 --> 00:52:49,467
- WELL, YEAH--

1211
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:50,601
- IT'S LIKE GETTING
INTO BUCKINGHAM PALACE.

1212
00:52:50,635 --> 00:52:51,736
- I SUPPOSE IT IS, BUT--

1213
00:52:51,769 --> 00:52:52,937
- I'LL SEE YOU
AT DINNERTIME, HUH?

1214
00:52:52,970 --> 00:52:55,240
- BYE-BYE, ELLIOTT.
- BYE-BYE, MOM.

1215
00:52:55,273 --> 00:52:56,241
- SKIPPER, BE A GOOD BOY.

1216
00:52:56,274 --> 00:52:59,410
- BYE, MOM.

1217
00:52:59,444 --> 00:53:00,945
- UH, ELLIOTT.

1218
00:53:00,978 --> 00:53:02,880
- GEE, DAD, I'D LIKE TO,
BUT I'M TAKING

1219
00:53:02,913 --> 00:53:04,815
THIS LITTLE ENGLISH NUMBER
OVER TO THE STUDENT QUARTER

1220
00:53:04,849 --> 00:53:08,286
AROUND SAINT-GERMAIN-DES-PRES
IN THE LEFT BANK.

1221
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:10,288
- OH, UH, OVER WHERE
THE ACTION IS.

1222
00:53:10,321 --> 00:53:11,689
- YEAH, WE'RE JUST GOING
TO KLUTZ AROUND

1223
00:53:11,722 --> 00:53:12,990
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

1224
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:16,494
THEN WE'RE GOING TO HAVE LUNCH
AT THE CAFE DE DEUX MAGOT.

1225
00:53:16,527 --> 00:53:17,828
- "DO MAGO"?

1226
00:53:17,862 --> 00:53:19,830
- YEAH, IN ENGLISH,
THAT MEANS CAFE--

1227
00:53:19,864 --> 00:53:22,400
- DON'T TELL ME.
I CAN GUESS.

1228
00:53:22,433 --> 00:53:23,834
AREN'T YOU GOING TO HAVE
BREAKFAST?

1229
00:53:23,868 --> 00:53:25,503
- OH, I'VE HAD IT.
ARE YOU KIDDING?

1230
00:53:25,536 --> 00:53:27,938
I WAS UP AT DAWN.
DAD, I SAW THE SUNRISE.

1231
00:53:27,972 --> 00:53:29,874
AND I SAW THE BOATS
COMING DOWN THE RIVER

1232
00:53:29,907 --> 00:53:33,411
AND THE MEN
WATERING DOWN THE STREETS.

1233
00:53:33,444 --> 00:53:34,945
OH, DAD, IF YOU COULD
JUST GET OFF

1234
00:53:34,979 --> 00:53:37,948
THIS TOURIST BEAT OF YOURS
AND GET TO KNOW THE REAL PARIS--

1235
00:53:37,982 --> 00:53:40,685
- GOOD-BYE, ELLIOTT.

1236
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:44,255
- OKAY, DAD.
I'M SORRY FOR YOU.

1237
00:53:47,325 --> 00:53:50,661
- SAY, UH, SKIPPER,
WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS FOR TODAY?

1238
00:53:50,695 --> 00:53:53,764
- WELL, I'M WITH YOU, POP.
ANYTHING YOU SAY.

1239
00:53:53,798 --> 00:53:55,533
- GOOD.
I'LL TELL YOU.

1240
00:53:55,566 --> 00:53:56,967
WHY DON'T WE GO TO THE LOUVRE?

1241
00:53:57,001 --> 00:53:59,637
- YOU'RE THE BOSS, POP.

1242
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:02,607
THEY GOT ANYTHING
FIT TO EAT IN THIS TOWN?

1243
00:54:04,709 --> 00:54:07,278
- WELL, THERE IT IS, SKIPPER--
THE LOUVRE.

1244
00:54:08,913 --> 00:54:11,916
THE MOST FAMOUS COLLECTION
OF ART TREASURES IN THE WORLD.

1245
00:54:11,949 --> 00:54:14,285
YOU KNOW, SKIPPER,
MOST PEOPLE THINK THE LOUVRE

1246
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:15,620
IS JUST FOR GROWN-UPS.

1247
00:54:15,653 --> 00:54:17,822
BUT YOU KNOW THAT PAINTING
OF CUSTER'S LAST STAND

1248
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:19,657
YOU'RE SO CRAZY ABOUT?
[laughs]

1249
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:20,825
WAIT TILL YOU GET A LOAD
OF SOME OF THE BATTLE SCENES

1250
00:54:20,858 --> 00:54:22,293
THEY'VE GOT IN THERE.

1251
00:54:22,327 --> 00:54:23,794
- OF COURSE,
THE WAY YOU TALK ABOUT IT,

1252
00:54:23,828 --> 00:54:25,763
I'M JUST DYING
TO SEE THE LOUVRE.

1253
00:54:25,796 --> 00:54:26,731
- SO?

1254
00:54:26,764 --> 00:54:29,834
- SO I'M JUST AFRAID
YOU'LL MISS THE SEWERS.

1255
00:54:29,867 --> 00:54:32,036
- SEWERS?

1256
00:54:32,069 --> 00:54:33,838
- SURE, THEY'RE FAMOUS TOO,
YOU KNOW?

1257
00:54:33,871 --> 00:54:35,573
- WELL, OF COURSE
THEY ARE SKIPPER, BUT--

1258
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:36,974
- REMEMBER THAT MOVIE
WE SAW ON TV

1259
00:54:37,007 --> 00:54:38,709
ABOUT THE FELLOW
WITH THE BEARD,

1260
00:54:38,743 --> 00:54:41,312
AND THE POLICE WERE CHASING HIM
THROUGH THE SEWERS OF PARIS

1261
00:54:41,346 --> 00:54:42,680
AND ALL THAT?

1262
00:54:42,713 --> 00:54:44,782
THAT WAS TERRIFIC, WASN'T IT?
- WELL, SURE, BUT--

1263
00:54:44,815 --> 00:54:46,951
WELL, YOU JUST COULDN'T GO DOWN
THERE AND WANDER AROUND, SON.

1264
00:54:46,984 --> 00:54:48,586
THE POLICE WOULDN'T LET YOU.

1265
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:49,720
- SURE THEY WILL.

1266
00:54:49,754 --> 00:54:51,789
THE FELLOW IN THE HOTEL--
HE EVEN SAID

1267
00:54:51,822 --> 00:54:53,624
THAT THEY HAVE A TOUR
THAT GOES DOWN THERE,

1268
00:54:53,658 --> 00:54:55,025
ONLY ONCE A WEEK, THOUGH.

1269
00:54:55,059 --> 00:54:57,795
YOU SEE?

1270
00:54:57,828 --> 00:54:59,797
AND THEY'RE LEAVING
IN TEN MINUTES!

1271
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:01,699
COME ON, POP.
- OH, BUT NOW, SKIPPER, WE--

1272
00:55:01,732 --> 00:55:03,968
- I'LL EVEN TREAT YOU.

1273
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:21,986
- AS YOU SEE,
THEY'VE LOCATED ONLY

1274
00:55:22,019 --> 00:55:24,054
THE FAMOUS PARIS
SYSTEM OF SEWERS.

1275
00:55:24,088 --> 00:55:26,457
THERE ARE ALSO SUCH
USEFUL PUBLIC NEEDS

1276
00:55:26,491 --> 00:55:30,861
AS WATER MAINS, TELEPHONE LINES,
AND ELECTRIC CABLES.

1277
00:55:30,895 --> 00:55:32,930
- THIS IS REALLY
INTERESTING, SKIPPER.

1278
00:55:32,963 --> 00:55:35,566
I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT ME
DOWN HERE.

1279
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:38,002
[loud hissing]

1280
00:55:40,938 --> 00:55:44,709
- THIS PIPE IS
A PNEUMATIC SYSTEM

1281
00:55:44,742 --> 00:55:47,445
WHICH DELIVERS
CERTAIN ITEMS OF MAIL

1282
00:55:47,478 --> 00:55:52,349
FROM THE CENTRAL POST OFFICE
TO VARIOUS PARTS OF THE CITY.

1283
00:55:57,488 --> 00:56:02,460
HEY, MONSIEUR,
WATCH YOUR HEAD.

1284
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:13,638
- THEY DID PRETTY NICE WORK
IN THOSE DAYS.

1285
00:56:13,671 --> 00:56:16,407
- POP.
- HMM?

1286
00:56:16,441 --> 00:56:18,709
- I HAVE TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM.

1287
00:56:18,743 --> 00:56:19,977
- WHAT--WHAT WAS WRONG
WITH THE HOTEL?

1288
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:22,413
- I DIDN'T HAVE TO THEN!

1289
00:56:22,447 --> 00:56:25,049
- OH, WELL, I'M AFRAID YOU'LL
JUST HAVE TO WAIT, SKIPPER.

1290
00:56:25,082 --> 00:56:28,686
- YOU DON'T THINK
THEY'D MIND DOWN HERE, DO YOU?

1291
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:30,455
- I'LL TELL YOU.
WE'LL ASK THE GUY.

1292
00:56:30,488 --> 00:56:32,122
NOW, COME ON,
THEY'RE GETTING AHEAD OF US.

1293
00:56:32,156 --> 00:56:34,158
COME ON.

1294
00:56:44,101 --> 00:56:47,738
- AS YOU SEE DEMONSTRATION,
CERTAIN AREAS

1295
00:56:47,772 --> 00:56:53,043
ARE MARKED WITH SIGNS
EXACTLY AS THE STREETS ABOVE.

1296
00:56:57,882 --> 00:57:01,852
THIS IS NECESSARY,
BECAUSE EVEN SEWER WORKERS

1297
00:57:01,886 --> 00:57:05,556
WITH MANY YEARS EXPERIENCE
BECOME EASILY LOST

1298
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:08,225
IN THE VAST
LABYRINTH OF TUNNELS

1299
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:09,627
BENEATH THE SURFACE.

1300
00:57:15,032 --> 00:57:17,735
- COME ON, SKIPPER,
MAYBE WE CAN ASK--

1301
00:57:17,768 --> 00:57:19,604
SKIPPER?
- LET'S GO.

1302
00:57:19,637 --> 00:57:21,939
- SKIPPER?

1303
00:57:21,972 --> 00:57:25,075
SKIPPER!

1304
00:57:25,109 --> 00:57:26,811
SKIPPER.

1305
00:57:26,844 --> 00:57:28,112
SKIPPER?

1306
00:57:28,145 --> 00:57:30,080
- MONSIEUR, I MUST ASK YOU
TO STAY WITH THE REST OF--

1307
00:57:30,114 --> 00:57:32,016
- MY BOY'S BACK HERE SOMEPLACE.
HE MIGHT BE LOST.

1308
00:57:32,049 --> 00:57:34,852
SKIPPER?
- LOOK, SKIPPER.

1309
00:57:34,885 --> 00:57:36,621
SKIPPER!
- SKIPPER!

1310
00:57:36,654 --> 00:57:38,122
- MONSIEUR, NO, JUST A MOMENT.

1311
00:57:38,155 --> 00:57:39,724
SKIPPER!

1312
00:57:39,757 --> 00:57:43,594
[all shouting]

1313
00:57:43,628 --> 00:57:45,830
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.
GO BACK, GO BACK.

1314
00:57:47,031 --> 00:57:51,001
- SKIPPER?

1315
00:57:51,035 --> 00:57:54,639
SKIPPER.

1316
00:57:57,041 --> 00:57:59,276
- OH, THERE YOU ARE, BOY.

1317
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:02,079
DO NOT REMOVE YOURSELF
AGAIN, HUH?

1318
00:58:02,112 --> 00:58:05,616
NO, NO, NO, NO.
YOU STAY RIGHT HERE WITH US.

1319
00:58:05,650 --> 00:58:06,884
[laughs]
COME ON.

1320
00:58:06,917 --> 00:58:11,021
MONSIEUR, YOUR SON
IS SAFE WITH US.

1321
00:58:11,055 --> 00:58:15,092
LET'S GO.
[speaking French]

1322
00:58:15,125 --> 00:58:18,796
- SKIPPER?

1323
00:58:21,899 --> 00:58:25,736
SKIPPER!

1324
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:33,243
SKIPPER?

1325
00:58:36,914 --> 00:58:40,551
SKIPPER?

1326

SKIPPER?

1327
00:58:47,191 --> 00:58:49,927
SKIPPER!

1328
00:58:53,864 --> 00:58:55,232
SKIPPER?

1329
00:58:55,265 --> 00:58:58,268
SKIPPER.

1330
00:59:00,004 --> 00:59:02,072
SKIPPER.

1331
00:59:02,973 --> 00:59:05,009
HELP.

1332
00:59:22,793 --> 00:59:26,063
HELP, HELP!

1333
00:59:41,045 --> 00:59:43,981

AU SECOURS!

1335
00:59:46,183 --> 00:59:49,319
JE SUIS LOST!

1336
00:59:56,326 --> 00:59:59,329
[loud hissing]

1337
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:12,076
AU SECOURS!

1338
01:00:15,212 --> 01:00:17,214
WHAT DOES THAT SAY?

1339
01:00:23,353 --> 01:00:26,691
OH.

1340
01:00:26,724 --> 01:00:28,025
SIGNS.

1341
01:00:28,058 --> 01:00:31,996
SIGNS, SIGNS,
PAGES ONE THROUGH NINE.

1342
01:00:34,064 --> 01:00:37,401
[speaking French]

1343
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:44,975
YEAH, YEAH.

1344
01:00:45,009 --> 01:00:49,413
DANGER--GAS.
NO OPEN FLAME.

1345
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:52,016
OH!

1346
01:01:09,033 --> 01:01:12,036

1351
01:01:52,076 --> 01:01:55,112
- THE OLDER GENERATION
ADMITTEDLY HAS PRETTY MUCH

1352
01:01:55,145 --> 01:01:58,048
FOULED THE WORLD UP,
AND IT'S, UH...

1353
01:01:58,082 --> 01:02:00,818
IT'S UP TO, UH...
IT'S UP TO US TO, UH...

1354
01:02:04,088 --> 01:02:06,056
SEE THAT?

1355
01:02:06,090 --> 01:02:10,027
LOOK AT THAT.

GENDARME?

1359
01:02:21,405 --> 01:02:24,942
PARDON, MONSIEUR,
I KNOW THIS IS PROBABLY

1360
01:02:24,975 --> 01:02:27,812
NONE OF MY BUSINESS,
NONE OF MY--

1361
01:02:27,845 --> 01:02:31,115
BUT--BUT HAVE YOU SEEN THAT?

1362
01:02:31,148 --> 01:02:33,217
THAT?

1363
01:02:39,957 --> 01:02:42,259
JUST THOUGHT
I'D MENTION IT.

1364
01:02:42,292 --> 01:02:44,862
THERE'S PROBABLY SOME POOR SOUL
IN TROUBLE DOWN THERE.

1365
01:02:44,895 --> 01:02:48,098
TROUBLE.

1366
01:02:58,075 --> 01:02:59,944
- IT'S ELLIOTT.

1367
01:02:59,977 --> 01:03:01,311
ELLIOTT!

1368
01:03:01,345 --> 01:03:05,149
ELLIOTT, IT'S DAD!

1369
01:03:05,182 --> 01:03:08,052
ELLIOTT, SON!

1370
01:03:08,085 --> 01:03:10,087
LOOK, IT'S DAD!

1371
01:03:14,491 --> 01:03:15,993
ELLIOTT!

1372
01:03:16,026 --> 01:03:17,461
OH, YOU.

- OH-OH!

1379
01:04:23,127 --> 01:04:25,029
- HI, POP.
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

1380
01:04:25,062 --> 01:04:26,931
- DON'T YOU TALK
TO ME, ELLIOTT--

1381
01:04:26,964 --> 01:04:29,033
A BIG HELP YOU ARE
STANDING UP THERE DOING NOTHING.

1382
01:04:29,066 --> 01:04:31,135
- STANDING UP WHERE?
- NEVER MIND, JUST NEVER MIND.

1383
01:04:55,993 --> 01:04:58,162
- WHEN ARE WE GOING TO EAT, MOM?
I'M STARVING.

1384
01:04:58,195 --> 01:05:02,499
- IN A LITTLE WHILE, DARLING.
[doorbell buzzes]

1385
01:05:07,004 --> 01:05:07,904
HARRY, WHAT KEPT YOU?

1386
01:05:07,938 --> 01:05:09,106
IT'S BEEN OVER AN HOUR
SINCE YOU PHONED.

1387
01:05:09,139 --> 01:05:11,508
- I KNOW, I THOUGHT THE FRESH
AIR MIGHT DO ME SOME GOOD.

1388
01:05:11,541 --> 01:05:15,212
- MY, YOU'RE A MESS.
- I KNOW, KATIE.

1389
01:05:15,245 --> 01:05:17,714
- HI, POP.

1390
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:21,051
- "HI, POP," HE SAYS.

1391
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:26,723
- I'M SORRY, BUT THAT GUIDE
HAD ME RIGHT BY THE HAND,

1392
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:28,625
AND WE ALL THOUGHT
YOU WERE RIGHT BEHIND US.

1393
01:05:28,658 --> 01:05:30,027
- OH, YOU DID, HUH?

1394
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:33,097
WELL, LISTEN,
JUST DROP THE WHOLE THING.

1395
01:05:33,130 --> 01:05:37,201
- HEY, POP, YOU KNOW,
YOU WERE RIGHT ABOUT THE LOUVRE.

1396
01:05:37,234 --> 01:05:40,604
- DO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME
YOU WENT TO THE LOUVRE--

1397
01:05:40,637 --> 01:05:41,438
I MEAN, LOUVRE?

1398
01:05:41,471 --> 01:05:44,074
- YEAH, I DROPPED IN
ON THE WAY HOME.

1399
01:05:44,108 --> 01:05:45,175
IT WAS TERRIFIC.

1400
01:05:45,209 --> 01:05:48,045
YOU OUGHT TO GO THERE
SOMETIME, POP.

1401
01:05:48,078 --> 01:05:52,082
LOOK, I BROUGHT YOU
SOME POSTCARDS.

1402
01:05:52,116 --> 01:05:53,250
- THANK YOU.

1403
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:56,386
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

1404
01:05:57,421 --> 01:05:58,455
SKIPPER!

1405
01:05:58,488 --> 01:05:59,689
COME ON BACK HERE.

1406
01:05:59,723 --> 01:06:01,358
STAND NEXT TO YOUR MOTHER, NOW.

1407
01:06:01,391 --> 01:06:03,227
COME ON, THAT A BOY.
THERE.

1408
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:06,530
OKAY, SMILE, AMY.

1409
01:06:32,256 --> 01:06:35,125
WELL, THERE'S
OUR FRIEND AGAIN.

1410
01:06:35,159 --> 01:06:37,794
- HARRY.

1411
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:40,064
I'M BEGINNING TO AGREE WITH YOU
ABOUT THIS BOY.

1412
01:06:40,097 --> 01:06:41,498
AMY COULD GET HURT.

1413
01:06:41,531 --> 01:06:43,100
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

1414
01:06:43,133 --> 01:06:44,368
- WELL, HER EYES WERE RED
FROM CRYING THIS MORNING,

1415
01:06:44,401 --> 01:06:46,236
SO I DECIDED TO ASK HER WHY.

1416
01:06:46,270 --> 01:06:47,771
SHE AND NICK HAD
AN ARGUMENT YESTERDAY.

1417
01:06:47,804 --> 01:06:49,706
- OH?
WHAT ABOUT?

1418
01:06:49,739 --> 01:06:52,642
- WELL, NICK SAID THAT
HE DIDN'T BELIEVE IN MARRIAGE

1419
01:06:52,676 --> 01:06:54,744
OR ANYTHING IDIOTIC LIKE THAT,

1420
01:06:54,778 --> 01:06:58,382
AND IF SHE WANTED TO HAVE FUN
OR A FRIENDLY ARRANGEMENT

1421
01:06:58,415 --> 01:07:00,717
OR WHATEVER THEY CALL IT THESE
DAYS, THAT WAS FINE WITH HIM.

1422
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:02,752
- THAT'S BIG OF HIM.

1423
01:07:02,786 --> 01:07:04,121
- WELL, SHE SIZZLED
AND TOLD HIM OFF.

1424
01:07:04,154 --> 01:07:05,789
I THOUGHT THAT
WOULD BE THE END OF IT.

1425
01:07:05,822 --> 01:07:08,625
- EVIDENTLY IT WASN'T.

1426
01:07:13,430 --> 01:07:14,731
- HARRY, I DON'T LIKE
WHAT'S HAPPENING.

1427
01:07:14,764 --> 01:07:16,800
I THINK WE SHOULD ASK HER
NOT TO SEE HIM ANYMORE.

1428
01:07:16,833 --> 01:07:18,802
- NO, I DON'T THINK SO, KATIE.

1429
01:07:18,835 --> 01:07:21,205
- YOU DON'T THINK SO?
WELL, THAT'S A CHANGE.

1430
01:07:21,238 --> 01:07:23,073
- WELL, IF AMY'S ANYTHING
LIKE YOU ARE,

1431
01:07:23,107 --> 01:07:25,509
WHICH SHE IS, SHE'S NOT GOING
TO LIKE OUR BUTTING IN.

1432
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:26,776
REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED
WHEN YOUR FATHER TOLD YOU

1433
01:07:26,810 --> 01:07:28,212
TO COME BACK FROM INDIANA
OR ELSE?

1434
01:07:28,245 --> 01:07:29,179
- OH, THAT WAS DIFFERENT.

1435
01:07:29,213 --> 01:07:31,348
- NO, NO, NO, THE POINT IS,
AMY'S GOT A LOT

1436
01:07:31,381 --> 01:07:33,517
OF GOOD COMMON SENSE, RIGHT?
- WELL, CERTAINLY.

1437
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:35,219
BUT WHEN A GIRL'S EMOTIONS
ARE INVOLVED,

1438
01:07:35,252 --> 01:07:37,254
SHE'S OUT OF TOUCH WITH LITTLE
THINGS LIKE COMMON SENSE.

1439
01:07:37,287 --> 01:07:40,324
- NOW, LISTEN, THIS
NICK O'MARA'S A SPOILED BRAT.

1440
01:07:40,357 --> 01:07:41,791
HE'S ARROGANT,
AND HE'S SELFISH.

1441
01:07:41,825 --> 01:07:42,792
AND THE MORE
WE THROW THEM TOGETHER,

1442
01:07:42,826 --> 01:07:45,529
THE SOONER AMY'S
GOING TO FIND THAT OUT, RIGHT?

1443
01:07:45,562 --> 01:07:46,730
- OH, I DON'T--

1444
01:07:46,763 --> 01:07:47,731
- WHY SHOULD WE MAKE
THIS CLOWN LOOK GOOD

1445
01:07:47,764 --> 01:07:48,865
BY TRYING TO KEEP THEM APART?

1446
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:51,768
BELIEVE ME, IF WE JUST
DON'T MAKE A MARTYR OUT OF HIM,

1447
01:07:51,801 --> 01:07:54,504
HE'LL FALL FLAT
ON HIS FACE.

1448
01:07:54,538 --> 01:07:56,240
- HARRY, YOU SURPRISE ME.

1449
01:07:56,273 --> 01:07:59,243
YOU'RE MORE DEVIOUS
THAN I GAVE YOU CREDIT FOR.

1450
01:07:59,276 --> 01:08:02,112
- WELL, I, UH, HAVE GIVEN
THE MATTER SOME THOUGHT.

1451
01:08:02,146 --> 01:08:04,881
- ALL RIGHT,
YOU HOOSIER MACHIAVELLI.

1452
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:05,949
WHERE'S YOUR FIRST MOVE?

1453
01:08:05,982 --> 01:08:09,085
- WELL, AS WE SAY HERE
IN PARIS, "REGARDE."

1454
01:08:18,628 --> 01:08:21,898
- THEY CALL NOTRE DAME
THE HEART OF FRANCE.

1455
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:24,668
EVERY ROAD IN FRANCE HAS
ITS GEOGRAPHICAL STARTING POINT

1456
01:08:24,701 --> 01:08:27,137
FROM A SPOT
IN FRONT OF THE CATHEDRAL.

1457
01:08:27,171 --> 01:08:29,539
CONSTRUCTION WAS BEGUN
IN 1163.

1458
01:08:29,573 --> 01:08:32,742
THAT'S OVER 300 YEARS
BEFORE AMERICA WAS DISCOVERED.

1459
01:08:32,776 --> 01:08:36,146
YET, FOR MY MONEY,
THE FLYING BUTTRESSES

1460
01:08:36,180 --> 01:08:38,882
AND, UH, OTHER ARCHITECTURAL
FEATURES IN THERE ARE AS MODERN

1461
01:08:38,915 --> 01:08:40,650
AS MOST OF THE STUFF
THAT THEY'RE BUILDING TODAY.

1462
01:08:40,684 --> 01:08:41,885
- 1163, HUH?

1463
01:08:41,918 --> 01:08:44,921
- WELL, IT'S VERY KIND OF YOU
TO SHOW US AROUND THIS WAY.

1464
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:48,392
- I, UH, HOPE THIS ISN'T
TOO BORING FOR YOU.

1465
01:08:48,425 --> 01:08:50,727
I MEAN, UH, BEING OUT
ON A FAMILY OUTING LIKE THIS.

1466
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:52,662
- OH, NO, NO,
NOT AT ALL.

1467
01:08:52,696 --> 01:08:54,764
I'M ENJOYING IT VERY MUCH,
MR. WILLARD.

1468
01:08:54,798 --> 01:08:58,268
IT'S VERY KIND OF YOU
TO INVITE ME ALONG.

1469
01:09:04,408 --> 01:09:07,544
IN CONTRAST TO NOTRE DAME,
WHICH IS GOTHIC,

1470
01:09:07,577 --> 01:09:09,813
SACRE COEUR THERE
IS BYZANTINE.

1471
01:09:09,846 --> 01:09:10,947
IT DOMINATES
THE HILL OF MONTMARTRE,

1472
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:13,817
WHICH NOT TOO LONG AGO WAS JUST
A LITTLE COUNTRY VILLAGE

1473
01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:15,785
OVERLOOKING THE CITY OF PARIS.

1474
01:09:15,819 --> 01:09:17,221
- DID YOU KNOW THAT, DADDY?

1475
01:09:17,254 --> 01:09:19,256
- WELL, TO TELL YOU
TO TRUTH, I DIDN'T.

1476
01:09:22,326 --> 01:09:24,828
- OH, DADDY, I'M HAVING
SUCH A GOOD TIME TODAY.

1477
01:09:24,861 --> 01:09:25,962
THANK YOU.

1478
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:27,531
DON'T YOU THINK
NICK'S WONDERFUL?

1479
01:09:27,564 --> 01:09:30,300
YOU CAN SEE THAT NOW,
CAN'T YOU?

1480
01:09:45,715 --> 01:09:48,585
- HEY, POP.
LOOK WHAT'S COMING.

1481
01:10:39,969 --> 01:10:41,971
- AMY.

1482
01:10:46,343 --> 01:10:47,944
- WHAT IS YOUR DAUGHTER,
CRAZY OR SOMETHING?

1483
01:10:47,977 --> 01:10:50,480
- IT'S POSSIBLE.

1484
01:10:50,514 --> 01:10:52,949
- SHE'S GOT ME SO BOILED UP,
I DON'T KNOW WHICH END'S UP.

1485
01:10:52,982 --> 01:10:54,918
YOU WOULDN'T LIKE TO EXPLAIN
HER TO ME, WOULD YOU?

1486
01:10:54,951 --> 01:10:55,885
- I'M NOT SURE I COULD.

1487
01:10:55,919 --> 01:10:57,921
IF I COULD EXPLAIN AMY
OR ANY OTHER MEMBER

1488
01:10:57,954 --> 01:10:59,656
OF MY FAMILY,
ALL THE FUN WOULD BE GONE.

1489
01:10:59,689 --> 01:11:01,425
- I GET THE FEELING
IF I BRIBED HER

1490
01:11:01,458 --> 01:11:02,492
WITH AN ENGAGEMENT RING,
SHE'D FEEL DIFFERENT.

1491
01:11:02,526 --> 01:11:04,694
- WELL, I CAN TELL YOU THIS.

1492
01:11:04,728 --> 01:11:05,929
YOU'RE WRONG THERE.

1493
01:11:05,962 --> 01:11:08,365
- SHE PUTS A PRICE ON HERSELF
AND A PRETTY HIGH PRICE TOO.

1494
01:11:08,398 --> 01:11:10,834
- NOW, LISTEN, YOUNG FELLOW,
YOU KEEP TALKING LIKE THAT,

1495
01:11:10,867 --> 01:11:13,670
AND I'M GOING TO KICK YOUR CAN
ALL THE WAY AROUND THE BLOCK.

1496
01:11:13,703 --> 01:11:15,805
AMY ISN'T FOR SALE,
AT ANY PRICE.

1497
01:11:15,839 --> 01:11:17,674
BUT IF YOU THINK SHE IS,
YOU GET THAT ENGAGEMENT RING

1498
01:11:17,707 --> 01:11:18,842
AND TRY IT
AND SEE WHERE YOU END UP.

1499
01:11:18,875 --> 01:11:20,944
- I MIGHT JUST DO THAT.
- YOU GO AHEAD.

1500
01:11:20,977 --> 01:11:23,046
I'D JUST LIKE
TO BE AROUND.

1501
01:11:23,079 --> 01:11:25,715
- YOU WILL BE.
YOU ALWAYS ARE.

1502
01:11:25,749 --> 01:11:27,917
- NOW, YOU LISTEN TO ME.
- YOU LISTEN TO ME, MR. WILLARD.

1503
01:11:27,951 --> 01:11:29,553
I'M JUST TRYING TO BE HONEST.

1504
01:11:29,586 --> 01:11:31,421
NOW, I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN MARRYING ANYBODY.

1505
01:11:31,455 --> 01:11:33,089
I TOLD AMY THAT.

1506
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:35,959
BECAUSE I DON'T HAPPEN TO
BELIEVE IN MARRIAGE, THAT'S WHY.

1507
01:11:35,992 --> 01:11:38,094
IT STARTS OUT FINE,
BUT IT'S A FAKE.

1508
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:39,829
AFTER A WHILE,
THE PEOPLE STOP LOVING.

1509
01:11:39,863 --> 01:11:42,031
THEY JUST GO ON MAKING BELIEVE,
OR THEY FIND SOMEBODY ELSE,

1510
01:11:42,065 --> 01:11:44,434
AND THEY GET A DIVORCE,
AND THE WHOLE IDIOTIC THING

1511
01:11:44,468 --> 01:11:45,969
STARTS ALL OVER AGAIN.

1512
01:11:46,002 --> 01:11:47,537
EITHER WAY, IT'S A TRAP.

1513
01:11:47,571 --> 01:11:49,038
- SON, YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

1514
01:11:49,072 --> 01:11:50,006
- [chuckles sarcastically]

1515
01:11:50,039 --> 01:11:51,841
I JUST HAPPEN TO LOOK
A LITTLE MORE DEEPLY

1516
01:11:51,875 --> 01:11:53,677
THAN MOST PEOPLE,
THAT'S ALL.

1517
01:11:53,710 --> 01:11:56,112
I DON'T LET ANYBODY TELL ME
WHAT TO BELIEVE OR THINK EITHER.

1518
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:57,847
I MAKE UP MY OWN MIND.

1519
01:11:57,881 --> 01:12:00,450
AND IF YOUR DAUGHTER THINKS
SHE'S GOING TO CHANGE IT--

1520
01:12:00,484 --> 01:12:01,718
- WHO SAID SHE WANTS
TO CHANGE IT?

1521
01:12:01,751 --> 01:12:02,919
- WELL, SHE THINKS
SHE'S GOING TO CHANGE IT

1522
01:12:02,952 --> 01:12:04,053
BY PLAYING HARD TO GET,
AND THEN GETTING ME

1523
01:12:04,087 --> 01:12:05,455
ALL BOILED UP,
AND IF YOU THINK

1524
01:12:05,489 --> 01:12:06,690
YOU'RE GOING TO ARGUE ME
INTO BELIEVING--

1525
01:12:06,723 --> 01:12:07,657
- I'M NOT TRYING
TO ARGUE YOU INTO ANYTHING.

1526
01:12:07,691 --> 01:12:08,992
- WELL, IF YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING TO ARGUE ME

1527
01:12:09,025 --> 01:12:10,927
INTO ANYTHING,
YOU'RE AS WRONG AS AMY.

1528
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:13,129
IF YOU CAME ABROAD TO GET
A HUSBAND FOR YOUR DAUGHTER--

1529
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:14,698
- WELL, THAT LAST THING I WANT
FOR MY DAUGHTER--

1530
01:12:14,731 --> 01:12:17,434
- IF THAT'S WHAT YOU
CAME ABROAD FOR, COUNT ME OUT.

1531
01:12:17,467 --> 01:12:19,636
I KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE ME.
- THAT'S FOR SURE.

1532
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:21,037
- BUT THAT MEANS
LESS THAN NOTHING TO ME.

1533
01:12:21,070 --> 01:12:22,839
LET ME TELL YOU,
I DON'T PLAY UP TO ANYBODY.

1534
01:12:22,872 --> 01:12:24,708
THE ONLY REASON
I STARTED TALKING TO YOU

1535
01:12:24,741 --> 01:12:27,444
WAS BECAUSE I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN AMY.

1536
01:12:27,477 --> 01:12:28,912
BUT I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN,
YOU DON'T KNOW THE FIRST THING

1537
01:12:28,945 --> 01:12:30,580
ABOUT ANYBODY IN YOUR FAMILY,

1538
01:12:30,614 --> 01:12:33,383
'CAUSE THAT'S THE SAFEST
WAY TO BE--DEAF, DUMB AND BLIND.

1539
01:12:33,417 --> 01:12:35,819
- LOOK, SON, I DON'T CLAIM
TO KNOW EVERYTHING, BECAUSE--

1540
01:12:35,852 --> 01:12:37,654
- THAT WAY YOU DON'T HAVE
TO REALIZE ANYTHING AROUND YOU,

1541
01:12:37,687 --> 01:12:39,689
AND YOU JUST GO ON PRETENDING
THAT YOU LOVE THEM ALL,

1542
01:12:39,723 --> 01:12:40,924
BECAUSE IT'S A NICE, SAFE HABIT.

1543
01:12:40,957 --> 01:12:42,058
- BECAUSE IF I KNEW EVERYTHING,
I'D BE LIKE YOU,

1544
01:12:42,091 --> 01:12:43,192
AND FROM WHAT I CAN SEE--

1545
01:12:43,226 --> 01:12:45,529
- IT GIVES YOU THAT PHONY
FEELING OF SELF-IMPORTANCE

1546
01:12:45,562 --> 01:12:46,930
TO THINK THAT THEY ALL
LOVE YOU BACK.

1547
01:12:46,963 --> 01:12:48,064
THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS,
NONE OF YOU KNOW

1548
01:12:48,097 --> 01:12:49,733
THE FIRST DAMN THING
ABOUT LOVE!

1549
01:12:49,766 --> 01:12:51,701
NONE OF YOU!

1550
01:13:25,735 --> 01:13:27,003
- BUT OF COURSE, MADEMOISELLE.

1551
01:13:27,036 --> 01:13:29,138
MONEY ISN'T EVERYTHING.

1552
01:13:29,172 --> 01:13:31,675
HAS IT BROUGHT ME HAPPINESS?

1553
01:13:31,708 --> 01:13:34,978
ONE ASKS THESE THINGS
OF ONESELF WHEN...

1554
01:13:35,011 --> 01:13:36,580
- GOOD MORNING, ELLIOTT.

1555
01:13:36,613 --> 01:13:39,449
MAY I SEE THAT, PLEASE?

1556
01:13:39,483 --> 01:13:42,786
OH, I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU'D ROBBED
A BANK OR SOMETHING.

1557
01:13:42,819 --> 01:13:44,053
- WELL, IT'S FOR
APPEARANCE'S SAKE, POP.

1558
01:13:44,087 --> 01:13:45,855
I MAY BE THE POOREST AMERICAN
IN PARIS,

1559
01:13:45,889 --> 01:13:46,956
BUT THERE'S NO POINT
IN ADVERTISING.

1560
01:13:46,990 --> 01:13:47,891
- I SEE.

1561
01:13:47,924 --> 01:13:49,726
- AND INCIDENTALLY,
SPEAKING OF MONEY--

1562
01:13:49,759 --> 01:13:51,060
- ELLIOTT, I AM
IN GOOD SPIRITS THIS MORNING,

1563
01:13:51,094 --> 01:13:52,829
AND I'M NOT GOING TO START
THE DAY OFF ARGUING

1564
01:13:52,862 --> 01:13:53,863
ABOUT YOUR ALLOWANCE.

1565
01:13:53,897 --> 01:13:54,998
HAS YOUR MOTHER GONE OUT?
- YEP.

1566
01:13:55,031 --> 01:13:57,567
- HOW ABOUT SKIPPER?
- YEP.

1567
01:13:57,601 --> 01:13:58,668
- AND WHERE'S AMY?

1568
01:13:58,702 --> 01:14:00,604
- SEARCH ME.

1569
01:14:00,637 --> 01:14:03,072
- ELLIOTT?

1570
01:14:03,106 --> 01:14:05,609
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO TO
THE LOUVRE WITH ME THIS MORNING?

1571
01:14:05,642 --> 01:14:06,876
- OH, IT'S TOO NICE
A DAY, POP.

1572
01:14:06,910 --> 01:14:09,879
CHECK ME NEXT TIME IT RAINS.

1573
01:14:09,913 --> 01:14:13,550
- OKAY, THEN I'LL GO
BY MYSELF.

1574
01:14:13,583 --> 01:14:14,884
HMM.

1575
01:14:49,919 --> 01:14:51,020
- BONJOUR, MONSIEUR.

1576
01:14:51,054 --> 01:14:52,556
- OH, BONJOUR.

1577
01:14:52,589 --> 01:14:54,257
SAY, THE LOUVRE.

1578
01:14:54,290 --> 01:14:56,893
THAT OPENS AT 10:00,
N'EST-CE PAS?

1579
01:14:56,926 --> 01:14:57,961
- THAT IS CORRECT, MONSIEUR.

1580
01:14:57,994 --> 01:14:59,295
- BON.

1581
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:01,931
THEN I THINK I'LL HAVE
A LITTLE PETIT DEJEUNER.

1582
01:15:01,965 --> 01:15:03,867
- MM.
- AVEC A--

1583
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:07,003
I MEAN, UH,
AVES VOUS, UH, HAM AND EGGS?

1584
01:15:07,036 --> 01:15:10,006
- HAM AND EGGS,
AMERICAN STYLE.

1585
01:15:10,039 --> 01:15:13,142
- OUI.
CAFE NOIR.

1586
01:15:13,176 --> 01:15:14,578
- AND BLACK COFFEE.

1587
01:15:14,611 --> 01:15:15,745
- GOOD.

1588
01:15:15,779 --> 01:15:17,881
WOULD YOU BRING THAT
TOUT DE SUITE?

1589
01:15:17,914 --> 01:15:19,148
- RIGHT AWAY, MONSIEUR.

1590
01:15:19,182 --> 01:15:22,051
- GOOD.
I MEAN, BON.

1591
01:15:41,337 --> 01:15:42,872
- WOULD YOU CARE
FOR A CIGARETTE?

1592
01:15:42,906 --> 01:15:45,141
- OH, NO, THANK YOU.
I DON'T SMOKE BEFORE BREAKFAST.

1593
01:15:45,174 --> 01:15:47,944
I, UH--
THANKS VERY MUCH.

1594
01:15:47,977 --> 01:15:52,081
- MAY I JOIN YOU?

1595
01:15:52,115 --> 01:15:53,717
- CERTAINLY.

1596
01:15:56,653 --> 01:15:58,988
- MONSIEUR?
- OH, MERCI.

1597
01:15:59,022 --> 01:16:00,824
UH?
- OH, THANK YOU.

1598
01:16:00,857 --> 01:16:04,994
[speaking French]
- [speaking French]

1599
01:16:05,028 --> 01:16:06,129
- YOU'RE AMERICAN?

1600
01:16:06,162 --> 01:16:08,898
- YES, I GUESS IT SHOWS, HUH?

1601
01:16:08,932 --> 01:16:11,100
- RICH, OF COURSE.

1602
01:16:11,134 --> 01:16:12,268
- NO, NO, NO,
I'M AFRAID NOT.

1603
01:16:12,301 --> 01:16:16,372
I'M A PLUMBING CONTRACTOR,
BUT I GUESS EVERYBODY THINKS

1604
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:20,176
ANYONE WHO HAS ANYTHING
TO DO WITH PLUMBING IS RICH.

1605
01:16:20,209 --> 01:16:21,778
- SO NOW YOU HAVE COME
TO FRANCE.

1606
01:16:21,811 --> 01:16:23,279
WHY?

1607
01:16:23,312 --> 01:16:25,882
- WELL, I GUESS,
WAY DOWN, EVERY AMERICAN

1608
01:16:25,915 --> 01:16:28,351
IS SORT OF IN LOVE WITH FRANCE,
AND SOONER OR LATER,

1609
01:16:28,384 --> 01:16:29,819
IF HE GETS THE CHANCE,
HE COMES OVER HERE

1610
01:16:29,853 --> 01:16:33,623
TO FIND OUT WHY.

1611
01:16:33,657 --> 01:16:34,624
- OH.

1612
01:16:34,658 --> 01:16:36,025
MERCI.

1613
01:16:36,059 --> 01:16:39,863
THERE ARE MANY
BEAUTIFUL THINGS HERE--

1614
01:16:39,896 --> 01:16:43,399
THE COUNTRYSIDE, THE ARTS,
THE RESTAURANTS.

1615
01:16:43,432 --> 01:16:45,769
- YES, I'M REALLY
ENJOYING IT.

1616
01:16:45,802 --> 01:16:49,806
- ALSO, THERE IS ROMANCE.

1617
01:16:56,345 --> 01:16:58,081
- OH.

1618
01:16:59,816 --> 01:17:02,318
WELL, YOU'RE
A VERY ATTRACTIVE WOMAN.

1619
01:17:02,351 --> 01:17:04,053
- THANK YOU.

1620
01:17:04,087 --> 01:17:07,957
- BUT I, UH--
I HAVE A PROBLEM.

1621
01:17:07,991 --> 01:17:09,425
- OH, HOW DO YOU SAY IT?

1622
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:11,094
YOU'RE NOT UNDERSTOOD AT HOME,
AND YOUR WIFE IS--

1623
01:17:11,127 --> 01:17:12,228
- NO, NO, NO, NO.

1624
01:17:12,261 --> 01:17:14,363
IT'S JUST THE OPPOSITE.
MY WIFE KNOWS ME LIKE A BOOK.

1625
01:17:14,397 --> 01:17:19,235
THE THING IS, UH,
I LOVE MY WIFE VERY MUCH.

1626
01:17:19,268 --> 01:17:21,738
SHE'S THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
WOMAN IN THE WORLD,

1627
01:17:21,771 --> 01:17:23,439
AT LEAST TO ME SHE IS.

1628
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:25,775
AND WE HAVE THREE KIDS,
AND THEY'RE ALL KIND OF NUTTY

1629
01:17:25,809 --> 01:17:27,176
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER,

1630
01:17:27,210 --> 01:17:31,080
BUT I'M CRAZY
ABOUT THEM TOO, SO, UH...

1631
01:17:34,183 --> 01:17:36,185
- [speaking French]

1632
01:17:36,219 --> 01:17:37,320
- I BEG YOUR PARDON?

1633
01:17:37,353 --> 01:17:39,022
- OH, I'M SORRY.

1634
01:17:39,055 --> 01:17:43,192
I SAID, "I BELIEVE YOU TRULY
ARE A RICH AMERICAN."

1635
01:17:43,226 --> 01:17:44,694
- OH.

1636
01:17:51,067 --> 01:17:53,036
I HOPE YOU'LL ENJOY
YOUR STAY IN FRANCE.

1637
01:17:53,069 --> 01:17:55,304
- I'M SURE I WILL.

1638
01:17:55,338 --> 01:17:57,273
- IT WAS VERY PLEASANT
TO MEET YOU.

1639
01:17:57,306 --> 01:17:59,442
- THANK YOU.

1640
01:17:59,475 --> 01:18:00,443
- AU REVOIR.

1641
01:18:00,476 --> 01:18:03,146
- GOOD-BYE.

1642
01:18:09,953 --> 01:18:10,920
- YOUR HAM AND EGGS, MONSIEUR.

1643
01:18:10,954 --> 01:18:13,723
- OH.

1644
01:18:13,757 --> 01:18:14,791
- GARCON?
- MONSIEUR?

1645
01:18:14,824 --> 01:18:16,926
- I THINK I'D LIKE
A SMALL BOTTLE OF WINE, PLEASE.

1646
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:19,462
- OUI, MONSIEUR.

1647
01:18:19,495 --> 01:18:20,463
WHAT KIND?

1648
01:18:20,496 --> 01:18:23,767
- OH, UH, WHATEVER KIND
GOES WITH HAM AND EGGS.

1649
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:25,134
[chuckles]

1650
01:18:25,168 --> 01:18:27,436
- OF COURSE.

1651
01:18:42,218 --> 01:18:45,188
[horn honking]

1652
01:18:45,221 --> 01:18:48,792
[Elliott laughing]

1653
01:18:48,825 --> 01:18:50,026
[speaking French]

1654
01:18:50,059 --> 01:18:53,296
OR SHOULD I SAY,
[speaking French]?

1655
01:18:53,329 --> 01:18:54,330
I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING,
YOU KNOW,

1656
01:18:54,363 --> 01:18:55,464
MONEY IS VERY DECEPTIVE.

1657
01:18:55,498 --> 01:18:56,399
I MEAN, IT'S INTERESTING,
YOU KNOW?

1658
01:18:56,432 --> 01:18:57,901
YOU TAKE MONEY--
WELL, JUST TO LOOK AT ME.

1659
01:18:57,934 --> 01:18:59,068
THE ORDINARY PERSON
WOULDN'T KNOW

1660
01:18:59,102 --> 01:19:00,469
THAT I HAD MONEY,
WOULD THEY?

1661
01:19:00,503 --> 01:19:03,339
SEE, I DON'T THINK MONEY
SHOULD BE AN OSTENTATIOUS THING.

1662
01:19:03,372 --> 01:19:06,275
I THINK IT SHOULD BE SORT OF
A BASIC FEELING WITHIN YOU

1663
01:19:06,309 --> 01:19:08,077
THAT YOU KNOW
HOW TO HANDLE YOURSELF

1664
01:19:08,111 --> 01:19:09,012
IN SITUATIONS THAT--

1665
01:19:09,045 --> 01:19:12,448
OOH.
OH, HELLO, POP.

1666
01:19:12,481 --> 01:19:14,050
UH, I'M GLAD YOU STOPPED BY.

1667
01:19:14,083 --> 01:19:15,384
I WANT YOU TO MEET
A VERY GOOD FRIEND OF MINE.

1668
01:19:15,418 --> 01:19:18,054
SHE'S, UH, VERY SOCIAL.
WONDERFUL FAMILY.

1669
01:19:18,087 --> 01:19:21,891
SHE'S BEEN TELLING ME ABOUT
HER STUDIES AT THE SORBONNE.

1670
01:19:21,925 --> 01:19:24,060
- IS THIS ONE OF THEM?

1671
01:19:24,093 --> 01:19:25,028
- YES.

1672
01:19:25,061 --> 01:19:28,031
- COME ON, ELLIOTT.
- WHY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

1673
01:19:28,064 --> 01:19:29,465
- GOOD-BYE, MY FRIEND.

1674
01:19:29,498 --> 01:19:31,467
- HEY, WHAT'S HAPPENING?
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

1675
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:33,469
- GO WITH YOUR FATHER, PLEASE.

1676
01:19:33,502 --> 01:19:35,038
- ELLIOTT.

1677
01:19:42,445 --> 01:19:45,481
- UH, MADEMOISELLE,
I'M TERRIBLY SORRY

1678
01:19:45,514 --> 01:19:46,950
WE TOOK UP
SO MUCH OF YOUR TIME.

1679
01:19:46,983 --> 01:19:50,219
- IT'S PERFECTLY ALL RIGHT.

1680
01:19:50,253 --> 01:19:52,055
MONSIEUR.

1681
01:19:52,088 --> 01:19:54,590
- DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER SONS
ABROAD IN PARIS?

1682
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:57,060
- YES, I HAVE ONE.

1683
01:19:57,093 --> 01:19:59,062
HE'S JUST 12 YEARS OLD.

1684
01:20:01,064 --> 01:20:03,332
- THANK YOU.

1685
01:20:06,569 --> 01:20:08,471
- NOW, WAIT A MINUTE, POP.
LISTEN, LET ME EXPLAIN THIS.

1686
01:20:08,504 --> 01:20:10,874
SHE CAME TO THE--
WELL, LOOK, I'LL SHOW YOU.

1687
01:20:10,907 --> 01:20:12,275
I WAS SITTING HERE,
MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS,

1688
01:20:12,308 --> 01:20:13,943
AND SHE CAME TO ME.
POP, THAT'S THE TRUTH.

1689
01:20:13,977 --> 01:20:15,044
SHE SAID, "WOULD YOU LIKE
TO HAVE A DRINK?"

1690
01:20:15,078 --> 01:20:17,146
- AND I SAID, "YES,
I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A DRINK."

1691
01:20:17,180 --> 01:20:18,481
AND THE NEXT THING I KNEW,
SHE SAT DOWN,

1692
01:20:18,514 --> 01:20:20,950
AND WE HAD A DRINK,
AND THEN YOU CAME UP.

1693
01:20:20,984 --> 01:20:23,086
I DIDN'T KNOW
HOW MUCH TIME HAD GONE BY.

1694
01:20:27,991 --> 01:20:28,824
- HI, MOM!
- HELLO, SKIPPER.

1695
01:20:28,858 --> 01:20:30,326
PUT THOSE IN MY ROOM,
HUH, DARLING?

1696
01:20:30,359 --> 01:20:32,896
- UH-HUH.

1697
01:20:32,929 --> 01:20:34,030
- WELL, HARRY.
- HI, KATIE.

1698
01:20:34,063 --> 01:20:36,065
- YOU'RE BACK
FROM THE LOUVRE ALREADY?

1699
01:20:36,099 --> 01:20:37,333
HOW WAS IT?

1700
01:20:37,366 --> 01:20:38,935
- WELL, I DIDN'T GET THERE.

1701
01:20:38,968 --> 01:20:40,203
IT SEEMS THAT EVERY TIME
I TRY TO GET TO THE LOUVRE,

1702
01:20:40,236 --> 01:20:41,204
SOMETHING HAPPENS.

1703
01:20:41,237 --> 01:20:44,073
LIKE THIS MORNING,
I WAS...

1704
01:20:44,107 --> 01:20:45,074
- YOU LIKE IT?

1705
01:20:45,108 --> 01:20:47,010
- YOUR HAIR?

1706
01:20:47,043 --> 01:20:48,211
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO IT?

1707
01:20:48,244 --> 01:20:49,545
- WELL, IT'S THE LATEST THING
OVER HERE.

1708
01:20:49,578 --> 01:20:51,047
THEY MADE IT SOUND
SO EXCITING.

1709
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:52,315
THEY SAID IT WOULD CHANGE
MY WHOLE PERSONALITY.

1710
01:20:52,348 --> 01:20:53,549
- OH?

1711
01:20:53,582 --> 01:20:55,318
- AS SOON AS I SAW IT,
I COULD SEE YOUR FACE

1712
01:20:55,351 --> 01:20:57,153
JUST THE WAY
IT LOOKS RIGHT NOW.

1713
01:20:57,186 --> 01:20:59,155
- OH, WELL...

1714
01:20:59,188 --> 01:21:01,057
HMM.

1715
01:21:01,090 --> 01:21:02,091
YOU DON'T LIKE IT?

1716
01:21:02,125 --> 01:21:05,561
- YEAH, YES, IT'S CUTE.

1717
01:21:05,594 --> 01:21:07,496
- YOU'D NEVER USE THAT WORD
UNLESS YOU LOATHED IT.

1718
01:21:07,530 --> 01:21:10,033
- WELL, I DIDN'T MEAN CUTE.
I MEAN, IT'S, UH...

1719
01:21:10,066 --> 01:21:11,300
WELL, IT'S PRETTY.

1720
01:21:11,334 --> 01:21:13,369
- HARRY, THERE'S NOTHING
THAT MAKES ME ANGRIER

1721
01:21:13,402 --> 01:21:15,238
THAN HAVING YOU AGREE WITH ME
WHEN YOU DON'T MEAN IT.

1722
01:21:15,271 --> 01:21:18,207
- I DO MEAN IT, KATIE.
I-IT'S REAL SNAZZY.

1723
01:21:18,241 --> 01:21:20,076
IT'S JUST THAT--WELL, YOU
KIND OR SURPRISED ME,

1724
01:21:20,109 --> 01:21:21,010
THAT'S ALL.
- IT'LL GROW OUT.

1725
01:21:21,044 --> 01:21:23,079
MY HAIR GROWS VERY FAST.
- OH, NOW, KATIE.

1726
01:21:23,112 --> 01:21:24,948
- WOW, NEAT-O.

1727
01:21:24,981 --> 01:21:26,549
WHO'S YOUR NEW GIRLFRIEND, POP?

1728
01:21:26,582 --> 01:21:28,952
- THANK YOU, SKIPPER.

1729
01:21:28,985 --> 01:21:31,587
- AND WHAT DO YOU
HAVE TO SAY, ELLIOTT?

1730
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:33,923
- HMM...

1731
01:21:33,957 --> 01:21:35,959
WELL, IT DOES MAKE YOU
LOOK YOUNGER,

1732
01:21:35,992 --> 01:21:37,226
IF THAT'S YOUR POINT,

1733
01:21:37,260 --> 01:21:39,695
BUT I'D ALWAYS THOUGHT
OF YOU AS OLDER.

1734
01:21:39,728 --> 01:21:42,231
[doorbell buzzes]
- WELL, THANKS A LOT.

1735
01:21:42,265 --> 01:21:43,967
THAT'S WHAT YOUR FATHER
THINKS TOO.

1736
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,935
- OH, NOW, WAIT A MINUTE, KATIE.
I DON'T THINK ANY SUCH THING.

1737
01:21:45,969 --> 01:21:47,070
- I WOULDN'T GO IN THERE
IF I WERE YOU.

1738
01:21:47,103 --> 01:21:48,337
POP HATES MOM'S NEW HAIRDO.

1739
01:21:48,371 --> 01:21:49,538
- I DO NOT HATE IT.

1740
01:21:49,572 --> 01:21:51,975
ALL I SAID TO YOUR MOTHER
WAS, "WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO IT?"

1741
01:21:52,008 --> 01:21:53,442
I DIDN'T MEAN--
- OH, MOTHER.

1742
01:21:53,476 --> 01:21:56,645
IT'S THE MOST STUNNING THING
I'VE EVER SEEN--

1743
01:21:56,679 --> 01:21:58,214
ABSOLUTELY DIVINE.

1744
01:21:58,247 --> 01:21:59,315
- IS THAT SO, DEAR?

1745
01:21:59,348 --> 01:22:01,417
- I REALLY LIKE IT, KATIE.

1746
01:22:01,450 --> 01:22:03,452
- MOTHER, YOU'RE GOING TO DRIVE
ALL THE MEN IN PARIS

1747
01:22:03,486 --> 01:22:04,687
OUT OF THEIR MINDS.

1748
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:06,689
WAIT TILL THEY SEE YOU
AT THE PARTY TONIGHT.

1749
01:22:06,722 --> 01:22:08,091
- PARTY?

1750
01:22:08,124 --> 01:22:11,227
- YES, AND DO YOU KNOW
WHO'S INVITED US?

1751
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:13,229
THE COMTESSE.
THE COMTESSE DUFRESNE.

1752
01:22:13,262 --> 01:22:14,597
- WHO'S THAT?

1753
01:22:14,630 --> 01:22:16,599
- THE COMTESSE,
NICK'S MOTHER.

1754
01:22:16,632 --> 01:22:18,234
- NICK'S MOTHER?

1755
01:22:18,267 --> 01:22:20,970
- YES, SHE HAS THIS FAMOUS
HOUSE IN AUTET.

1756
01:22:21,004 --> 01:22:23,106
ABSOLUTELY EVERYBODY
IN PARIS WILL BE THERE,

1757
01:22:23,139 --> 01:22:25,174
BECAUSE SHE'S INTRODUCING
HER NEW PROTEGE--

1758
01:22:25,208 --> 01:22:27,510
A YOUNG ARGENTINE
CONCERT PIANIST,

1759
01:22:27,543 --> 01:22:29,712
HER THIRD PROTEGE
IN SIX MONTHS.

1760
01:22:29,745 --> 01:22:32,381
- BUT I, UH--I THOUGHT
AFTER WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY,

1761
01:22:32,415 --> 01:22:33,182
YOU AND NICK WERE ALL-

1762
01:22:33,216 --> 01:22:36,085
- OH, DADDY,
THAT WAS YESTERDAY.

1763
01:22:36,119 --> 01:22:37,086
- OH.

1764
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:39,055
- WELL, ANYWAY,
SHE FOUND OUT ABOUT NICK AND ME,

1765
01:22:39,088 --> 01:22:40,489
SO NOTHING WOULD DO,
BUT SHE HAD TO HAVE

1766
01:22:40,523 --> 01:22:42,091
US ALL OUT THERE
TO LOOK US OVER.

1767
01:22:42,125 --> 01:22:43,559
- TO LOOK US OVER?

1768
01:22:43,592 --> 01:22:45,061
- WELL, CERTAINLY.

1769
01:22:45,094 --> 01:22:47,163
SHE'S PROBABLY
VERY JEALOUS ABOUT NICK,

1770
01:22:47,196 --> 01:22:48,164
BUT I WANT TO KEEP
AN OPEN MIND ABOUT HER.

1771
01:22:48,197 --> 01:22:49,632
- OH, OF COURSE.

1772
01:22:49,665 --> 01:22:52,035
- COME ON, MOTHER, WE'VE GOT
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO WEAR.

1773
01:22:52,068 --> 01:22:54,103
- KATIE, I DON'T THINK
WE OUGHT TO GET MIXED UP--

1774
01:22:54,137 --> 01:22:56,105
- OH, HARRY, THIS IS PARIS,
DARLING, REMEMBER?

1775
01:22:56,139 --> 01:22:58,074
WORST COMES TO WORST,
WE'LL HAVE A MARVELOUS TIME

1776
01:22:58,107 --> 01:23:00,076
SEEING ALL THESE PEOPLE.
- YEAH.

1777
01:23:00,109 --> 01:23:02,245
- AMY, DO YOU THINK MY
BLACK SHEATH IS DRESSY ENOUGH?

1778
01:23:02,278 --> 01:23:05,148
- KATIE, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE ON MY SIDE.

1779
01:23:18,161 --> 01:23:22,131
[indistinct chatter]

1780
01:23:31,674 --> 01:23:34,243
- IF MY LUCK HOLDS OUT,
SHE WON'T BE HERE TONIGHT.

1781
01:23:34,277 --> 01:23:35,344
- EXCUSE ME.
- YES, DEAR.

1782
01:23:35,378 --> 01:23:36,712
- MOTHER, THE WILLARDS
HAVE ARRIVED.

1783
01:23:36,745 --> 01:23:38,381
- OH.

1784
01:23:38,414 --> 01:23:43,219
HOLD THAT FOR ME, PLEASE.
COME ALONG, DARLING.

1785
01:23:46,355 --> 01:23:47,490
BARON.

1786
01:23:47,523 --> 01:23:51,727
[speaking German]

1787
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:54,363
DARLINGS, DARLINGS,
DARLINGS, NO, NO, NO, NO.

1788
01:23:54,397 --> 01:23:56,765
DON'T TELL ME WHO YOU ARE.
YOU'RE THE WILLARDS.

1789
01:23:56,799 --> 01:23:59,402
AREN'T YOUR PRECIOUS,
MRS. WILLARD?

1790
01:23:59,435 --> 01:24:03,672
ADORABLE, MR. WILLARD--
SO TALL AND HANDSOME.

1791
01:24:03,706 --> 01:24:05,774
ISN'T HE THE LONGEST THING?

1792
01:24:05,808 --> 01:24:09,112
AND YOU MUST BE AMY.

1793
01:24:09,145 --> 01:24:11,780
WHY, YOU'RE A RAVING BEAUTY.

1794
01:24:11,814 --> 01:24:14,117
WHY, AMY, YOU CHARMER.

1795
01:24:14,150 --> 01:24:17,120
NO WONDER YOU'VE DRIVEN
MY DARLING NICKY-POO

1796
01:24:17,153 --> 01:24:18,487
TO DISTRACTION.

1797
01:24:18,521 --> 01:24:19,655
- THIS IS MY MOTHER.

1798
01:24:19,688 --> 01:24:21,090
- COME ALONG, DEARS,
COME ALONG.

1799
01:24:21,124 --> 01:24:24,127
[gasps] SUCH A GHASTLY PARTY,
DARLINGS--

1800
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:26,129
ONE OF MY VERY WORST.

1801
01:24:26,162 --> 01:24:28,197
BUT ALL THE MOST AMUSING PEOPLE
ARE IN THE COTE D'AZUR

1802
01:24:28,231 --> 01:24:29,498
THIS TIME OF YEAR.

1803
01:24:29,532 --> 01:24:31,100
NO ONE HERE
BUT THE SWEEPINGS, THE DREGS,

1804
01:24:31,134 --> 01:24:34,403
THE ABSOLUTE DREGS OF PARIS.
[laughs]

1805
01:24:34,437 --> 01:24:35,871
BUT I JUST COULDN'T WAIT
ANOTHER MINUTE

1806
01:24:35,904 --> 01:24:37,873
TO SHOW OFF
MY DARLING CARLOS.

1807
01:24:37,906 --> 01:24:39,508
THERE HE IS OVER THERE
AT THE PIANO.

1808
01:24:45,181 --> 01:24:49,118
WHAT A DELICIOUSLY EVIL FACE
HE HAS, DON'T YOU THINK?

1809
01:24:49,152 --> 01:24:50,586
IF THERE'S ONE THING
I CAN'T STAND

1810
01:24:50,619 --> 01:24:51,887
IT'S A CLEAN-CUT MAN.

1811
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:54,123
WHAT DID YOU SAY
YOUR NAME WAS, DEAR?

1812
01:24:54,157 --> 01:24:56,459
- OH, KATIE.
- KATE--KATIE?

1813
01:24:56,492 --> 01:24:59,795
OH, HOW CHARMING,
HOW HONEST AND TRUE,

1814
01:24:59,828 --> 01:25:02,898
HOW AMERICAN, MOON SHINING
OVER THE BACK FENCE.

1815
01:25:02,931 --> 01:25:04,333
HOW IN SWEET HADES, KATIE,
DO YOU MANAGE

1816
01:25:04,367 --> 01:25:05,468
TO KEEP YOUR LOOKS--

1817
01:25:05,501 --> 01:25:06,902
I MEAN, GROWN-UP CHILDREN
AND ALL?

1818
01:25:06,935 --> 01:25:10,273
EVERY MAN IN THIS ROOM IS DYING
TO GET HIS HANDS ON YOU.

1819
01:25:10,306 --> 01:25:12,341
COME ON, DARLINGS.
COME ON, DEARS, COME ALONG.

1820
01:25:12,375 --> 01:25:15,411
- OH, HARRY,
THAT'S SO SILLY.

1821
01:25:15,444 --> 01:25:19,148
- OH, KATIE, DARLING.

1822
01:25:19,182 --> 01:25:21,384
COME ALONG.

1823
01:25:21,417 --> 01:25:23,819
- HARRY, I--

1824
01:25:23,852 --> 01:25:26,389
- I WANT YOU TO MEET
THE MOST DIVINE MAN.

1825
01:25:26,422 --> 01:25:28,724
HE HASN'T TAKEN HIS EYES OFF YOU
SINCE YOU CAME IN.

1826
01:25:35,831 --> 01:25:38,234
- MONSIEUR.
- UH, NO, NO, THANKS.

1827
01:25:38,267 --> 01:25:40,936
UH, WAIT A MINUTE, MAYBE THIS
LITTLE THING RIGHT HERE.

1828
01:25:40,969 --> 01:25:43,806
WHAT DO YOU CALL THIS?

1829
01:25:43,839 --> 01:25:45,774
OH, YOU DON'T SPEAK
ENGLISH, HUH?

1830
01:25:45,808 --> 01:25:47,876
- [speaking French]

1831
01:25:47,910 --> 01:25:50,213
IT LIFTS OFF
THE INHIBITIONS, MONSIEUR.

1832
01:25:50,246 --> 01:25:52,781
ALLOWS ONE TO GAZE
AT ONE'S INNER BEING.

1833
01:25:52,815 --> 01:25:54,883
- WELL.
- TRES DESIRABLE, NO?

1834
01:25:54,917 --> 01:25:59,955
- WELL, YEAH, I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT DOING THAT VERY THING.

1835
01:25:59,988 --> 01:26:01,524
HEY, THAT'S VERY TASTY.

1836
01:26:01,557 --> 01:26:03,259
YOU MEAN THAT'S REAL LIQUOR?

1837
01:26:03,292 --> 01:26:05,561
IT KIND OF TASTES LIKE
LICORICE WATER.

1838
01:26:05,594 --> 01:26:07,430
- OOH, OOH, OOH,
SIP IT SLOWLY, MONSIEUR.

1839
01:26:07,463 --> 01:26:10,399
SUCH A DRINK DOES NOT
MAKE FRIENDS IN A HURRY.

1840
01:26:10,433 --> 01:26:14,169
- WELL, THANKS VERY MUCH.

1841
01:26:23,512 --> 01:26:25,814
- [laughs]
MY DARLINGS.

1842
01:26:25,848 --> 01:26:27,950
THE MOST AMUSING THING--

1843
01:26:27,983 --> 01:26:32,221
MY DEAREST NICKY,
SO CHARMING AND HANDSOME,

1844
01:26:32,255 --> 01:26:35,224
WANTS TO GO TO WORK.

1845
01:26:35,258 --> 01:26:36,292
- NICKY?
[speaking French]

1846
01:26:36,325 --> 01:26:37,760
- STARTING AS A LITTLE MOUSE

1847
01:26:37,793 --> 01:26:41,930
IN SOME DREARY ARCHITECT'S
OFFICE BACK IN THE STATES.

1848
01:26:41,964 --> 01:26:44,233
CAN YOU IMAGINE
OUR NICHOLAS

1849
01:26:44,267 --> 01:26:47,236
SHARPENING PENCILS,
BUYING SANDWICHES,

1850
01:26:47,270 --> 01:26:49,638
RUNNING ERRANDS?
[laughter]

1851
01:26:49,672 --> 01:26:51,006
- CUT IT OUT, MOTHER.
- NICKY, DARLING.

1852
01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:53,409
IF YOU DON'T LIKE MY MONEY
AND YOU WANT TO EARN

1853
01:26:53,442 --> 01:26:55,678
A BIT OF YOUR OWN,
I'LL SPEAK TO SOME

1854
01:26:55,711 --> 01:26:58,414
OF MY DEAR, DULL FRIENDS,
AND YOU CAN HAVE

1855
01:26:58,447 --> 01:27:00,349
ALL THE COMMISSIONS
YOU WANT,

1856
01:27:00,383 --> 01:27:05,821
BUILDING LOVELY BUILDINGS
ALL OVER EUROPE.

1857
01:27:05,854 --> 01:27:07,623
AND HE CAN HAVE
HIS OWN LITTLE PEOPLE

1858
01:27:07,656 --> 01:27:09,825
TO RUN ERRANDS
AND SHARPEN PENCILS.

1859
01:27:09,858 --> 01:27:14,497
NOW, WHY ARE YOU GLARING
AT ME THAT WAY, NICKY DARLING?

1860
01:27:14,530 --> 01:27:15,864
EVERYTHING'S SO RIDICULOUS.

1861
01:27:21,737 --> 01:27:23,972
- LOVELY WOMAN.

1862
01:27:24,006 --> 01:27:26,342
- OH. OH.

1863
01:27:29,745 --> 01:27:32,381
YES, THAT HAPPENS TO BE--

1864
01:27:32,415 --> 01:27:34,016
- POOR CREATURE COMES
INNOCENTLY TO PARIS

1865
01:27:34,049 --> 01:27:36,018
AND RUNS DEAD-ON INTO THE LEADER
OF THE WOLF PACK.

1866
01:27:36,051 --> 01:27:36,919
- WHO?

1867
01:27:36,952 --> 01:27:39,021
- THE DEVIL HIMSELF,
RUDOLPH HUNSCHAK.

1868
01:27:39,054 --> 01:27:40,956
- OH.

1869
01:27:40,989 --> 01:27:42,958
- ARE YOU GOING TO SAY
YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF HIM?

1870
01:27:42,991 --> 01:27:44,560
- NO, I'M SORRY,
I HAVEN'T.

1871
01:27:44,593 --> 01:27:46,762
- HUNSCHAK IS THE MOST
DANGEROUS MAN IN EUROPE.

1872
01:27:46,795 --> 01:27:49,832
- FOR WOMEN?
- FOR HUSBANDS.

1873
01:27:49,865 --> 01:27:52,368
RUDOLPH'S ONLY INTERESTED
IN A WOMAN IF SHE'S MARRIED.

1874
01:27:52,401 --> 01:27:54,837
IT'S HIS SPECIALITY.
- OH.

1875
01:27:54,870 --> 01:27:56,038
WELL, I'M AFRAID
HE'S GOING TO HAVE

1876
01:27:56,071 --> 01:27:57,973
A LITTLE PROBLEM
THIS TIME.

1877
01:27:58,006 --> 01:27:59,942
- AFRAID YOU DON'T KNOW
YOUR MAN, OLD CHAP.

1878
01:27:59,975 --> 01:28:02,911
RUDOLPH NEVER GIVES UP
UNTIL HE WINS.

1879
01:28:02,945 --> 01:28:06,715
- I'M AFRAID YOU DON'T KNOW
YOUR WOMAN, OLD CHAP.

1880
01:28:06,749 --> 01:28:10,319
- YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY
THAT YOU'RE THE--

1881
01:28:10,353 --> 01:28:15,324
I SAY, OLD MAN,
I'M MOST TERRIBLY SORRY I...

1882
01:28:23,599 --> 01:28:25,701
- VERY GOOD.

1883
01:28:25,734 --> 01:28:29,037
SAY, IF YOU DON'T MIND,
I, UH, FEEL KIND OF SILLY

1884
01:28:29,071 --> 01:28:33,709
WALKING AROUND WITH
THIS LITTLE EYEDROPPER, SO...

1885
01:28:33,742 --> 01:28:35,811
I BET YOU IT'LL SAVE YOU
A FEW STEPS.

1886
01:28:35,844 --> 01:28:36,979
OH, I'M SORRY.

1887
01:28:37,012 --> 01:28:38,714
I KEEP FORGETTING
YOU DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH.

1888
01:28:38,747 --> 01:28:40,015
MERCI.

1889
01:29:02,805 --> 01:29:04,573
- I'M SORRY, NICK.

1890
01:29:04,607 --> 01:29:05,974
- WHO DOES SHE THINK
SHE'S KIDDING?

1891
01:29:06,008 --> 01:29:09,545
SHE'S NOT ABOUT
TO TURN ME LOOSE, NOT HER.

1892
01:29:09,578 --> 01:29:10,979
OH, SHE MIGHT GO
FOR A WEDDING, ALL RIGHT.

1893
01:29:11,013 --> 01:29:14,116
GIVE HER A CHANCE TO PLAY
THE DOTING MOTHER FOR A WHILE.

1894
01:29:14,149 --> 01:29:15,718
BUT AFTERWARD, HONEY,
SHE'D SABOTAGE YOU

1895
01:29:15,751 --> 01:29:16,985
IN THREE DAYS FLAT.

1896
01:29:17,019 --> 01:29:18,954
- NICK, FORGET
ABOUT YOU AND ME.

1897
01:29:18,987 --> 01:29:20,656
THAT'S DONE WITH.

1898
01:29:20,689 --> 01:29:22,991
BUT HONESTLY, DON'T YOU THINK
YOU OUGHT TO GET AWAY FROM HERE,

1899
01:29:23,025 --> 01:29:24,860
GET A JOB,
FIND A PLACE FOR YOURSELF--

1900
01:29:24,893 --> 01:29:26,462
- AMY.

1901
01:29:26,495 --> 01:29:29,131
MOTHER'S A BIZARRE OLD GIRL,
BUT SHE'S SMART.

1902
01:29:29,164 --> 01:29:30,866
SHE KNOWS ME BETTER
THAN I DO MYSELF.

1903
01:29:30,899 --> 01:29:32,568
SHE KNOWS I COULDN'T MAKE IT
IN A LOUSY JOB

1904
01:29:32,601 --> 01:29:34,069
BACK IN NEW YORK.
- NICK, YOU'RE NOT--

1905
01:29:34,102 --> 01:29:35,471
- SO DO YOURSELF A FAVOR.
JUST STAY OUT OF THIS.

1906
01:29:35,504 --> 01:29:37,105
- YOU'RE NOT BEING
FAIR TO YOURSELF.

1907
01:29:37,139 --> 01:29:40,175
- [speaking French]

1908
01:29:40,208 --> 01:29:42,711
- I'M SORRY,
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

1909
01:29:42,745 --> 01:29:45,714
- SHE SAID, WOULD YOU BE ANGRY
IF SHE DANCED WITH ME?

1910
01:29:45,748 --> 01:29:48,183
- [speaking French]

1911
01:29:48,216 --> 01:29:50,185
MADEMOISELLE AMY...
[speaking French]

1912
01:29:50,218 --> 01:29:51,854
- MERCI.

1913
01:29:51,887 --> 01:29:53,722
- NICK.

1914
01:29:53,756 --> 01:29:55,458
- LOOK, AMY.

1915
01:29:55,491 --> 01:29:58,126
ELOISA'S PERFECTLY SATISFIED
WITH ME THE WAY I AM.

1916
01:29:58,160 --> 01:30:02,130
SHE ISN'T TRYING
TO CHANGE ME.

1917
01:30:11,173 --> 01:30:12,741
- HARRY.

1918
01:30:12,775 --> 01:30:14,577
- OH, THERE YOU ARE, KATIE.

1919
01:30:14,610 --> 01:30:16,879
- I'D LIKE TO GO HOME NOW.
- GO HOME?

1920
01:30:16,912 --> 01:30:18,881
HOME'S THOUSANDS
OF MILES AWAY, KATIE.

1921
01:30:18,914 --> 01:30:20,849
WE'RE IN PARIS.
ENJOY YOURSELF, HAVE FUN.

1922
01:30:20,883 --> 01:30:22,451
ISN'T THAT WHAT
WE'RE HERE FOR?

1923
01:30:22,485 --> 01:30:24,119
HEY, WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE BOYFRIEND?

1924
01:30:24,152 --> 01:30:25,688
- YOU STOP THAT.

1925
01:30:25,721 --> 01:30:27,189
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?
STOP IT, YOU HEAR ME?

1926
01:30:27,222 --> 01:30:28,991
- HOW CAN I HEAR YOU, KATIE,
WITH ALL THIS

1927
01:30:29,024 --> 01:30:30,593
GAY PARISIAN GAIETY
GOING ON?

1928
01:30:30,626 --> 01:30:31,927
- WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?

1929
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:32,861
I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU
LIKE THIS BEFORE.

1930
01:30:32,895 --> 01:30:34,830
- I'VE NEVER BEEN
LIKE THIS BEFORE, KATIE.

1931
01:30:34,863 --> 01:30:35,964
I'M AWAKE.
I'M ALIVE.

1932
01:30:35,998 --> 01:30:37,866
FOR THE FIRST TIME,
I SEE MY WIFE

1933
01:30:37,900 --> 01:30:39,968
AS SHE REALLY IS--
A FEMME FATALE.

1934
01:30:40,002 --> 01:30:41,870
MEN FALLING ALL OVER THEMSELVES
TRYING TO GET NEAR YOU,

1935
01:30:41,904 --> 01:30:43,872
KISSING YOUR HAND...
- OH, HARRY, NOW, THAT'S--

1936
01:30:43,906 --> 01:30:45,541
- MAKING LOVE TO YOU
WITH THEIR EYES.

1937
01:30:45,574 --> 01:30:46,542
OOH, HERE HE COMES NOW.

1938
01:30:46,575 --> 01:30:48,477
- HERE YOU ARE, MADAME.

1939
01:30:48,511 --> 01:30:50,078
- THANK YOU.

1940
01:30:50,112 --> 01:30:51,747
- YOU ARE UNDOUBTEDLY
THE HUSBAND.

1941
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:53,482
- OUI.
- I'M RUDOLPH HUNSCHAK.

1942
01:30:53,516 --> 01:30:55,150
I'VE BEEN ENJOYING YOUR WIFE--

1943
01:30:55,183 --> 01:30:58,153
SO SPARKLING, SO CHARMING,
SO FRESH.

1944
01:30:58,186 --> 01:31:00,889
- YOU'RE A LITTLE FRESH
YOURSELF, RUDOLPH.

1945
01:31:00,923 --> 01:31:02,057
I'VE HEARD ABOUT YOU.

1946
01:31:02,090 --> 01:31:03,325
THEY TELL ME
YOU'RE QUITE A CHARACTER.

1947
01:31:03,358 --> 01:31:06,261
BUT THAT'S OKAY, JUST AS LONG
AS KATIE'S HAVING A GOOD TIME.

1948
01:31:06,294 --> 01:31:08,564
- IT'S GETTING VERY LATE.

1949
01:31:08,597 --> 01:31:11,199
- SUCH LOVELY HAIR,
SO DISTINCT.

1950
01:31:11,233 --> 01:31:13,201
WHO BUT SOMEONE
WITH A FACE LIKE MADAME

1951
01:31:13,235 --> 01:31:16,271
CAN MAKE THIS STYLE
A PERSONAL TRIUMPH?

1952
01:31:16,304 --> 01:31:17,740
- OH, REALLY?

1953
01:31:17,773 --> 01:31:20,576
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT
THE OLD WAY.

1954
01:31:20,609 --> 01:31:22,711
- IT'S GETTING VERY LATE.

1955
01:31:22,745 --> 01:31:24,880
- NOW, KATIE, IT'S JUST
THE SHANK OF THE EVENING.

1956
01:31:24,913 --> 01:31:25,881
- OH, NO, MR. WILLARD.

1957
01:31:25,914 --> 01:31:28,216
BETTER YOU TAKE
THE LOVELY MADAME SAFELY AWAY.

1958
01:31:28,250 --> 01:31:31,153
WITH MANY MEN AROUND HERE,
IT'S NOT SAFE.

1959
01:31:31,186 --> 01:31:33,288
- KATIE?
[laughs]

1960
01:31:33,321 --> 01:31:36,291
MY WIFE WOULD BE
SAFE ANYPLACE.

1961
01:31:36,324 --> 01:31:38,561
OH, NOW, KATIE,
I DIDN'T MEAN IT QUITE THAT WAY.

1962
01:31:38,594 --> 01:31:41,163
- I WOULD LIKE TO GO HOME.

1963
01:31:41,196 --> 01:31:42,297
- MADAME WILLARD
HAS BEEN DISCUSSING YOU.

1964
01:31:42,330 --> 01:31:43,165
SHE WILL SPEAK
OF LITTLE ELSE.

1965
01:31:43,198 --> 01:31:46,869
SHE WARNED ME
OF YOUR VIOLENT TEMPER.

1966
01:31:46,902 --> 01:31:50,138
BUT NOW THAT I MEET YOU,
I SEE THAT SHE EXAGGERATES.

1967
01:31:50,172 --> 01:31:52,741
- AH, PARDON ME, SWEETHEART.

1968
01:31:52,775 --> 01:31:54,843
DID SHE ALSO HAPPEN TO MENTION
THAT I WAS ONCE

1969
01:31:54,877 --> 01:31:56,745
A PROFESSIONAL WRESTLER?
- WRESTLER?

1970
01:31:56,779 --> 01:31:59,081
WHAT IS THIS--OH.

1971
01:31:59,114 --> 01:32:00,583
I SEE THAT
YOU'RE PULLING MY LEG.

1972
01:32:00,616 --> 01:32:03,018
- [laughing]
BROTHER, WHEN I PULL YOUR LEG,

1973
01:32:03,051 --> 01:32:05,020
YOU'RE GOING TO KNOW IT.

1974
01:32:05,053 --> 01:32:06,889
[laughs]
TAKE IT EASY, KATIE.

1975
01:32:06,922 --> 01:32:10,125
WE'RE JUST HAVING A LITTLE
FRIENDLY DISCUSSION, THAT'S ALL.

1976
01:32:10,158 --> 01:32:11,694
OH.

1977
01:32:11,727 --> 01:32:13,629
OH...

1978
01:32:23,872 --> 01:32:26,141
BOY, YOU DO GET AROUND,
DON'T YOU?

1979
01:32:26,174 --> 01:32:31,046
OH, DON'T GO AWAY.
DON'T GO AWAY.

1980
01:32:36,919 --> 01:32:40,255
MERCI.

1981
01:32:57,673 --> 01:32:59,842
HI, BABY.

1982
01:32:59,875 --> 01:33:03,912
WHY AREN'T YOU IN THERE
"FOLDEROLLING" AROUND?

1983
01:33:03,946 --> 01:33:06,248
- NICHOLAS O'MARA, ESQUIRE.

1984
01:33:06,281 --> 01:33:10,118
BOY, I GUESS I KNOW HIM
FOR WHAT HE REALLY IS NOW.

1985
01:33:10,152 --> 01:33:12,621
"GET A JOB," I SAID.

1986
01:33:12,655 --> 01:33:14,122
THAT'S FUNNY.

1987
01:33:14,156 --> 01:33:18,627
HE'S THE ORIGINAL HOLLOW REED,
THAT'S WHAT HE IS.

1988
01:33:18,661 --> 01:33:21,997
- WELL, NOW, I THINK MAYBE
THAT'S ABOUT ENOUGH OF THAT.

1989
01:33:22,030 --> 01:33:25,768
NOT THAT I'M JEALOUS--
I DON'T GET JEALOUS.

1990
01:33:25,801 --> 01:33:30,806
I DON'T LIKE IT--
THAT'S WHAT IT BOILS DOWN TO.

1991
01:33:33,441 --> 01:33:37,112
- WITHOUT HIS LOVING MOTHER
TO BACK HIM UP,

1992
01:33:37,145 --> 01:33:40,148
HE COULDN'T GET A JOB
POURING WATER OUT OF A BOOT.

1993
01:33:45,087 --> 01:33:48,857
- SOME HUSBANDS WOULD BE
JEALOUS, BUT NOT ME.

1994
01:33:48,891 --> 01:33:52,160
BUT I CAN GET ANNOYED.

1995
01:34:04,740 --> 01:34:06,909
- DADDY, I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT
TO SPOIL MOTHER'S FUN,

1996
01:34:06,942 --> 01:34:09,244
BUT I FEEL LIKE A PERFECT FOOL
STAYING AROUND HERE.

1997
01:34:09,277 --> 01:34:12,147
WILL YOU TAKE ME
BACK TO THE HOTEL?

1998
01:34:12,180 --> 01:34:14,449
- YOU KNOW THAT LITTLE FELLOW
WITH THE BEARD WAS RIGHT.

1999
01:34:14,482 --> 01:34:19,087
THIS STUFF REALLY LOOSENS
UP YOUR INHIBITIONS.

2000
01:34:23,959 --> 01:34:28,330
NOW, THIS ISN'T A SUDDEN IMPULSE
ON MY PART, MIND YOU.

2001
01:34:28,363 --> 01:34:30,232
I THOUGHT OF IT WAY BACK--
WELL, SHORTLY AFTER

2002
01:34:30,265 --> 01:34:32,034
I SAT DOWN HERE.

2003
01:34:32,067 --> 01:34:35,237
I REASONED THE WHOLE THING OUT
VERY "CALCULATALY"--

2004
01:34:35,270 --> 01:34:38,106
UH, VERY CAREFULLY.

2005
01:34:38,140 --> 01:34:39,908
- DADDY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

2006
01:34:39,942 --> 01:34:42,044
- NO REASON IN THE WORLD
WHY I SHOULDN'T DO IT.

2007
01:34:42,077 --> 01:34:43,411
OF COURSE
THERE MIGHT BE A COUPLE,

2008
01:34:43,445 --> 01:34:44,913
BUT WE'LL JUST IGNORE THEM.

2009
01:34:44,947 --> 01:34:46,248
- DO WHAT?

2010
01:34:46,281 --> 01:34:49,051
- HANG ONE NICE BIG SHANDY
ON RUDOLPH,

2011
01:34:49,084 --> 01:34:53,789
THE RED-NOSED HUNGARIAN.

2012
01:34:53,822 --> 01:34:55,090
NOW...

2013
01:34:59,327 --> 01:35:01,229
- DADDY.

2014
01:35:14,042 --> 01:35:18,313
DADDY?
- OH.

2015
01:35:18,346 --> 01:35:21,917
HI, BABY.

2016
01:35:21,950 --> 01:35:24,319
OH, BOY.

2017
01:35:24,352 --> 01:35:26,054
DID I HIT HIM
OR VICE VERSA?

2018
01:35:26,088 --> 01:35:29,257
- NO, I'M AFRAID
WHAT YOU WERE DRINKING

2019
01:35:29,291 --> 01:35:31,293
GOT YOU FIRST.

2020
01:35:31,326 --> 01:35:34,196
- THAT'S TOO BAD.

2021
01:35:34,229 --> 01:35:36,431
IT WAS THAT GREEN-LIQUOR STUFF.

2022
01:35:36,464 --> 01:35:38,066
I REMEMBER
WHEN I WAS A KID ONCE,

2023
01:35:38,100 --> 01:35:41,136
I GOT SICK FROM EATING
TOO MUCH LICORICE.

2024
01:35:41,169 --> 01:35:42,037
- HERE, DADDY, DRINK THIS.
- NO, NO.

2025
01:35:42,070 --> 01:35:43,171
I DON'T THINK I'D BETTER.

2026
01:35:43,205 --> 01:35:44,907
- COME ON, IT'LL BE
GOOD FOR YOU.

2027
01:35:44,940 --> 01:35:47,075
- WELL, OKAY.

2028
01:35:47,109 --> 01:35:50,813
I-I-I CAN SIT UP, I-I THINK.

2029
01:35:50,846 --> 01:35:52,848
YEAH.

2030
01:35:57,085 --> 01:36:00,022
THAT'S ENOUGH.

2031
01:36:00,055 --> 01:36:03,058
[sighs]

2032
01:36:03,091 --> 01:36:03,992
OH, YOU POOR KID.

2033
01:36:04,026 --> 01:36:05,861
YOU LEFT THE PARTY
ON ACCOUNT OF ME, HUH?

2034
01:36:05,894 --> 01:36:08,864
WHERE'S YOUR MOTHER?
HAS SHE GONE TO BED?

2035
01:36:08,897 --> 01:36:10,432
- OH, NO,
SHE'S STILL AT THE PARTY.

2036
01:36:10,465 --> 01:36:12,901
- STILL AT THE PARTY?

2037
01:36:12,935 --> 01:36:14,937
OH, SHE DOESN'T KNOW, HUH?

2038
01:36:14,970 --> 01:36:16,939
- OH, DADDY,
I DIDN'T WANT TO UPSET HER.

2039
01:36:16,972 --> 01:36:18,406
YOU WERE ABSOLUTELY GREEN.

2040
01:36:18,440 --> 01:36:19,942
- I-I...

2041
01:36:19,975 --> 01:36:21,476
- BESIDES, A NICE CAB DRIVER
HELPED ME GET YOU

2042
01:36:21,509 --> 01:36:23,078
OUT THROUGH THE TERRACE
AND BACK TO THE HOTEL.

2043
01:36:23,111 --> 01:36:25,080
- THAT WAS NICE OF HIM.
- HERE, FINISH THIS.

2044
01:36:25,113 --> 01:36:27,215
- NO, NO, NO, NO,
NO, THANKS.

2045
01:36:27,249 --> 01:36:29,818
HEY, I'VE GOT TO GO
AND RESCUE YOUR MOTHER

2046
01:36:29,852 --> 01:36:31,486
FROM THAT HUNGARIAN
WOLFHOUND.

2047
01:36:31,519 --> 01:36:33,155
- OOH, DADDY.
HADN'T YOU BETTER REST?

2048
01:36:33,188 --> 01:36:34,156
- NO, NO, NO.

2049
01:36:34,189 --> 01:36:36,458
THERE'S A TIME FOR REST
AND A TIME FOR ACTION.

2050
01:36:36,491 --> 01:36:38,060
WHERE--WHERE'S MY COAT?

2051
01:36:38,093 --> 01:36:39,461
- UH, IT'S OVER THERE.
- ALL RIGHT.

2052
01:36:39,494 --> 01:36:41,930
NOW, YOU BETTER
GO TO BED NOW.

2053
01:36:41,964 --> 01:36:44,499
THANKS FOR TAKING CARE OF ME.
GOOD NIGHT.

2054
01:38:06,248 --> 01:38:07,349
- HARRY?
- HMM?

2055
01:38:07,382 --> 01:38:09,084
OH, HI, THERE.
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

2056
01:38:09,117 --> 01:38:10,318
- ALL RIGHT?

2057
01:38:10,352 --> 01:38:13,221
WHAT COULD HAPPEN TO ME?
OF COURSE I'M ALL RIGHT.

2058
01:38:13,255 --> 01:38:15,057
- WELL, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

2059
01:38:15,090 --> 01:38:16,191
- OH, OUT ON THE TOWN.

2060
01:38:16,224 --> 01:38:19,627
YOU KNOW, THE WAY YOU'RE
SUPPOSED TO BE IN GAY OLD PARIS.

2061
01:38:19,661 --> 01:38:20,963
- YOU'RE UPSET, AREN'T YOU?

2062
01:38:20,996 --> 01:38:24,066
- UPSET? ME?
[laughs]

2063
01:38:24,099 --> 01:38:25,968
- WELL, THAT'S HILARIOUS.
- OH, SURE, THAT'S ME.

2064
01:38:26,001 --> 01:38:27,936
GOOD OLD HILARIOUS HARRY--

2065
01:38:27,970 --> 01:38:30,472
ALWAYS THERE TO COME HOME TO.

2066
01:38:30,505 --> 01:38:34,642
- HARRY, I WANT YOU
TO LISTEN TO ME.

2067
01:38:34,676 --> 01:38:36,611
ARE YOU LISTENING?
- MM.

2068
01:38:36,644 --> 01:38:38,046
- WELL, NOW, WHY DIDN'T YOU--

2069
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:39,982
WILL YOU LISTEN TO ME?

2070
01:38:40,015 --> 01:38:41,349
- OH, IF YOU THINK
IT'S IMPORTANT, I'LL LISTEN.

2071
01:38:41,383 --> 01:38:42,350
GO AHEAD.
- WE'LL YOU'D BETTER.

2072
01:38:42,384 --> 01:38:43,685
YOU JUST BETTER.

2073
01:38:43,718 --> 01:38:45,087
NOW WHY DIDN'T YOU
LEND A HELPING HAND

2074
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:46,254
BACK AT THE PARTY?

2075
01:38:46,288 --> 01:38:48,957
YOU COULD SEE I NEEDED HELP
TO GET RID OF THAT LEECH.

2076
01:38:48,991 --> 01:38:50,092
- OH, NOW, KATIE,
IS THAT ANY WAY TO TALK

2077
01:38:50,125 --> 01:38:53,295
ABOUT A DASHING HUNGARIAN ROMEO
WHO'S JUST TAKEN YOU OUT

2078
01:38:53,328 --> 01:38:54,629
FOR A BEAUTIFUL EVENING?

2079
01:38:54,662 --> 01:38:56,598
- NOW GET OFF
YOUR HIGH HORSE.

2080
01:38:56,631 --> 01:38:57,732
- YOU KNOW, HON, I'M HUNGRY.

2081
01:38:57,765 --> 01:38:59,467
I THINK I'LL HAVE
SOMETHING SENT UP.

2082
01:38:59,501 --> 01:39:01,503
YOU DON'T MIND
IF I EAT WHILE YOU TALK, DO YOU?

2083
01:39:01,536 --> 01:39:02,304
MAYBE YOU'D LIKE TO JOIN ME.

2084
01:39:02,337 --> 01:39:04,973
HOW ABOUT SOME
HUNGARIAN GOULASH?

2085
01:39:05,007 --> 01:39:07,642
- HARRY WILLARD, NOW YOU SHUT UP
AND LISTEN TO ME.

2086
01:39:07,675 --> 01:39:09,711
YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL
ABOUT OTHER MEN,

2087
01:39:09,744 --> 01:39:11,513
ALL OTHER MEN,

2088
01:39:11,546 --> 01:39:13,315
AND ESPECIALLY THOSE
UNATTACHED HANDSOME JOES

2089
01:39:13,348 --> 01:39:15,617
THAT GO AROUND MAKING A PASS
AT EVERYONE WOMAN THEY MEET.

2090
01:39:15,650 --> 01:39:17,219
- OH, YOU THINK
HE'S HANDSOME, DO YOU?

2091
01:39:17,252 --> 01:39:19,254
AND WHEN DID HE MAKE THE PASS--
IN THE TAXI?

2092
01:39:19,287 --> 01:39:21,256
- RUDOLPH DIDN'T EXACTLY--
- YOU CALL HIM RUDOLPH NOW.

2093
01:39:21,289 --> 01:39:22,190
WHY NOT "RUDY?"

2094
01:39:22,224 --> 01:39:24,226
I COULDN'T HELP
KNOWING HIS NAME, COULD I?

2095
01:39:24,259 --> 01:39:26,061
I'VE BEEN WITH THE MAN
FOR FOUR HOURS.

2096
01:39:26,094 --> 01:39:27,295
- DID I ASK YOU
WHERE YOU'VE BEEN?

2097
01:39:27,329 --> 01:39:30,098
DID I ASK YOU ONCE?
- WELL, I'M TELLING YOU.

2098
01:39:30,132 --> 01:39:32,100
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
SO CHARGED UP ABOUT, KATIE.

2099
01:39:32,134 --> 01:39:33,568
I THINK I'M BEING
A PERFECT GENTLEMAN,

2100
01:39:33,601 --> 01:39:35,237
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

2101
01:39:35,270 --> 01:39:36,338
- WELL, WHAT ABOUT
THE CIRCUMSTANCES

2102
01:39:36,371 --> 01:39:38,173
OF YOU GETTING STONED
AND LEAVING ME

2103
01:39:38,206 --> 01:39:39,774
HIGH AND DRY
AT THE PARTY?

2104
01:39:39,807 --> 01:39:41,709
I'M NOT SAYING ANYTHING
ABOUT THE FACT

2105
01:39:41,743 --> 01:39:43,645
THAT RUDOLPH THOUGHT HE GLIMPSED
YOU LEAVING THE PARTY

2106
01:39:43,678 --> 01:39:45,247
WITH A YOUNG GIRL,

2107
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:47,215
BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE IT--
NOT YOU.

2108
01:39:47,249 --> 01:39:49,784
- OH, YOU KNOW ME BACKWARD
AND FORWARDS, DON'T YOU?

2109
01:39:49,817 --> 01:39:52,087
I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU THOUGHT
TO CALL THE HOTEL HERE.

2110
01:39:52,120 --> 01:39:55,057
- I DID!
WELL, RATHER, RUDOLPH DID.

2111
01:39:55,090 --> 01:39:56,658
HE CALLED TWICE
AND SAID NO ONE ANSWERED.

2112
01:39:56,691 --> 01:39:58,526
- OH, THAT'S WHAT HE SAID, HUH?
- YES, HE DID.

2113
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:00,662
AND HE ALSO SAID HE KNEW
EVERY BAR IN PARIS

2114
01:40:00,695 --> 01:40:02,797
WHERE AMERICANS WANDER INTO
WHEN THEY'VE HAD TOO MANY.

2115
01:40:02,830 --> 01:40:05,633
- OH.
- SO HE VOLUNTEERED TO HELP.

2116
01:40:05,667 --> 01:40:08,103
- I BET HE JUST COULDN'T
WAIT TO FIND ME.

2117
01:40:08,136 --> 01:40:09,371
- HARRY, IF YOU'RE GOING
TO BE JEALOUS,

2118
01:40:09,404 --> 01:40:11,239
I'D RATHER YOU STOP
PUSSYFOOTING AROUND

2119
01:40:11,273 --> 01:40:12,774
AND COME RIGHT OUT
AND BE JEALOUS.

2120
01:40:12,807 --> 01:40:15,243
DON'T BUILD IT
INTO SOMETHING ELSE.

2121
01:40:15,277 --> 01:40:17,345
- OH, YOU MEAN
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE?

2122
01:40:17,379 --> 01:40:20,182
- IF YOU DON'T STOP THIS,
I'M GOING TO THROW SOMETHING.

2123
01:40:20,215 --> 01:40:21,516
- ALL RIGHT,
HOW ABOUT SOMETHING HEAVY?

2124
01:40:21,549 --> 01:40:23,185
HOW ABOUT THIS?

2125
01:40:23,218 --> 01:40:25,253
- OH, HARRY, SIT DOWN,
AND LET'S BE CALM.

2126
01:40:25,287 --> 01:40:28,656
- I'M CALM.
- WELL, SIT DOWN, ANYWAY.

2127
01:40:28,690 --> 01:40:31,126
I COULDN'T HELP IT.

2128
01:40:31,159 --> 01:40:32,227
I KNOW RUDOLPH PULLED
A FAST ONE.

2129
01:40:32,260 --> 01:40:34,462
HE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE YOU WERE,
AND HE DIDN'T CARE.

2130
01:40:34,496 --> 01:40:35,663
HE WANTED TO BE ALONE WITH ME.

2131
01:40:35,697 --> 01:40:37,132
- AHA, THEN YOU DO ADMIT THAT.

2132
01:40:37,165 --> 01:40:39,667
- DAMNATION, HARRY,
DAMNATION.

2133
01:40:39,701 --> 01:40:41,269
- SHH, WE HAVE NEIGHBORS,
YOU KNOW.

2134
01:40:41,303 --> 01:40:42,670
- DAMNATION
TO THE NEIGHBORS TOO.

2135
01:40:42,704 --> 01:40:44,206
I HAVE SOMETHING
I WANT TO TELL YOU.

2136
01:40:44,239 --> 01:40:45,640
- ALL RIGHT, GO AHEAD.

2137
01:40:45,673 --> 01:40:47,342
- WELL, WHEN I CAME OUT
OF THE LAST BAR,

2138
01:40:47,375 --> 01:40:50,112
LOOKING FOR YOU,
I CALLED A TAXI.

2139
01:40:50,145 --> 01:40:52,480
WELL, FRIEND RUDOLPH
HOPPED INTO THE TAXI WITH ME.

2140
01:40:52,514 --> 01:40:54,116
AND THEN DRIVING
THROUGH THE PARK--

2141
01:40:54,149 --> 01:40:55,783
- THROUGH THE PARK?
- YES, THROUGH THE PARK.

2142
01:40:55,817 --> 01:40:57,585
HOW DO I KNOW
WHAT HE TOLD THE DRIVER?

2143
01:40:57,619 --> 01:40:59,254
HE KISSED ME.

2144
01:40:59,287 --> 01:41:00,655
- HE KISSED YOU?
- YES.

2145
01:41:00,688 --> 01:41:02,390
NOW, YOU SEE,
I'M TELLING YOU EVERYTHING.

2146
01:41:02,424 --> 01:41:05,127
AND I SLAPPED HIM HARD
AND DID THAT FEEL GOOD.

2147
01:41:05,160 --> 01:41:06,461
- THE KISS?
- THE SLAP!

2148
01:41:06,494 --> 01:41:07,795
- OH.

2149
01:41:07,829 --> 01:41:11,333
- THEN I TOLD THE TAXI DRIVER
TO BRING ME HERE TOUT SUITE.

2150
01:41:11,366 --> 01:41:13,135
AND I COME IN HERE TO THIS,

2151
01:41:13,168 --> 01:41:15,803
TO YOU, ACTING LIKE THIS,
WHEN IT WAS ALL YOUR FAULT

2152
01:41:15,837 --> 01:41:17,272
TO BEGIN WITH.

2153
01:41:17,305 --> 01:41:20,142
AND A LOT
OF APPRECIATION I GET,

2154
01:41:20,175 --> 01:41:22,677
TRAIPSING ALL OVER TOWN
LOOKING FOR YOU.

2155
01:41:22,710 --> 01:41:24,412
AND IF YOU DON'T TAKE
THAT EXPRESSION OFF YOUR FACE,

2156
01:41:24,446 --> 01:41:25,547
I'M GOING TO SLAP IT.

2157
01:41:25,580 --> 01:41:28,250
- ALL I KNOW IS
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT

2158
01:41:28,283 --> 01:41:30,652
TO KISS A GIRL WHEN SHE
DOESN'T WANT TO BE KISSED.

2159
01:41:30,685 --> 01:41:33,121
- WHY, YOU--

2160
01:41:33,155 --> 01:41:35,123
NOW I HOPE YOU'RE SATISFIED.

2161
01:41:35,157 --> 01:41:36,891
- DO YOU WANT TO GET US
TOSSED OUT OF HERE?

2162
01:41:36,924 --> 01:41:40,362
YOU MIGHT HAVE HIT
SOMEBODY DOWN THERE.

2163
01:41:42,930 --> 01:41:44,299
KATIE.

2164
01:41:46,168 --> 01:41:48,503
KATIE.

2165
01:42:20,535 --> 01:42:22,270
- YOU OUGHT TO COME
BACK IN, POP.

2166
01:42:22,304 --> 01:42:25,240
THE WATER'S GREAT.
[laughter]

2167
01:42:25,273 --> 01:42:27,475
- MY FRENCH IS PRETTY BAD.

2168
01:42:27,509 --> 01:42:30,212
I WANT TO ASK YOU,
WHAT'S THE WORD FOR THIS?

2169
01:42:30,245 --> 01:42:31,946

2171
01:42:34,382 --> 01:42:35,683

2172
01:42:35,717 --> 01:42:37,819
NOW--NOW, WHAT'S THE WORD

2173
01:42:37,852 --> 01:42:40,255

2181
01:42:59,807 --> 01:43:01,476
- WELL, ONE THING YOU'VE GOT
TO SAY ABOUT THAT KID.

2182
01:43:01,509 --> 01:43:03,778
HE KNOWS HOW TO MAKE AN ASSET
OUT OF A LANGUAGE BARRIER.

2183
01:43:03,811 --> 01:43:07,249
- HOW DO YOU LIKE
ELLIOTT'S MUSTACHE, POP?

2184
01:43:07,282 --> 01:43:10,752
- I THINK I LIKE THE ONE
ON THE GIRL'S MOTHER BETTER.

2185
01:43:10,785 --> 01:43:13,688
- SHE SURE IS KEEPING
A CLOSE WATCH ON HIM.

2186
01:43:13,721 --> 01:43:15,957
- PERSONALLY,
I DON'T BLAME HER.

2187
01:43:15,990 --> 01:43:18,926
- ONE THING--THEY SURE GOT
A LOT OF GIRLS AROUND HERE.

2188
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:22,830
- YEAH, THAT ONE-TRACK MIND
OF ELLIOTT'S IS LIABLE TO CRACK

2189
01:43:22,864 --> 01:43:25,667
UNDER THE WHOLE
WONDERFUL STRAIN.

2190
01:43:25,700 --> 01:43:27,769
- HOLA, MONSIEUR.

2191
01:43:27,802 --> 01:43:29,437
- MERCI, MONSIEUR.

2192
01:43:29,471 --> 01:43:31,239
[speaking French]

2193
01:43:31,273 --> 01:43:34,342
S'IL VOUS PLAIT.

2194
01:43:48,055 --> 01:43:50,758
- OH, NO, MONSIEUR.
KEEP THE CHANGE.

2195
01:43:50,792 --> 01:43:53,328
- MERCI BEAUCOUP, MONSIEUR.

2196
01:43:55,563 --> 01:43:59,567
- YOU KNOW, MONEY'S LIKE A BIRD.
IT COMES, AND IT GOES.

2197
01:44:14,982 --> 01:44:17,919
[knock at door]

2198
01:44:17,952 --> 01:44:18,786
- OH.

2199
01:44:18,820 --> 01:44:22,290
- MADAME WILLARD.
- OH, MERCI.

2200
01:44:35,069 --> 01:44:37,705
- WHY, HARRY...

2201
01:44:37,739 --> 01:44:40,074
YOU'RE A DARLING.
THANK YOU.

2202
01:44:40,107 --> 01:44:41,909
- UH, KATIE.
- YOU DIDN'T NEED TO APOLOGIZE.

2203
01:44:41,943 --> 01:44:43,077
IT WAS JUST AS MUCH
MY FAULT IN PARIS

2204
01:44:43,110 --> 01:44:44,779
AS IT WAS YOURS.
- NOW, LOOK, KATIE.

2205
01:44:44,812 --> 01:44:45,780
- YOU ALWAYS SEND ME FLOWERS
WHEN YOU FEEL GUILTY

2206
01:44:45,813 --> 01:44:46,648
ABOUT SOMETHING.

2207
01:44:46,681 --> 01:44:47,982
- I DON'T FEEL GUILTY
ABOUT ANYTHING,

2208
01:44:48,015 --> 01:44:49,050
AND I DIDN'T SEND YOU
THE FLOWERS.

2209
01:44:49,083 --> 01:44:51,853
IF ANYBODY SHOULD
FEEL GUILT ABOUT SOMETHING...

2210
01:44:51,886 --> 01:44:55,457
"DEAR MADAME WILLARD"--
I SUPPOSE IT SHOULD BE WILL-ARD.

2211
01:44:55,490 --> 01:44:57,091
"IS IT NOT
A BEAUTIFUL COINCIDENCE

2212
01:44:57,124 --> 01:44:59,093
"THAT I HAPPENED TO ARRIVE
ON BUSINESS?

2213
01:44:59,126 --> 01:45:01,529

2216
01:45:05,066 --> 01:45:06,701
OH, I'LL BET.

2217
01:45:06,734 --> 01:45:10,505
"WITH DEEP ADMIRATION,
RUDOLPH."

2218
01:45:10,538 --> 01:45:11,939
- WELL, ISN'T THAT ODD?

2219
01:45:11,973 --> 01:45:13,708
- YES, IT IS ODD.

2220
01:45:13,741 --> 01:45:16,077
HOW DID HE FIND OUT
WE WERE HERE?

2221
01:45:16,110 --> 01:45:17,979
- WELL, I DON'T
REALLY KNOW, DEAR.

2222
01:45:18,012 --> 01:45:19,714
UH, IT COULD HAVE COME OUT
OF A CONVERSATION

2223
01:45:19,747 --> 01:45:20,848
AT THE CONTESSA'S.

2224
01:45:20,882 --> 01:45:24,085
- OH.

2225
01:45:24,118 --> 01:45:25,953
- BUT THEY ARE LOVELY,
AREN'T THEY?

2226
01:45:25,987 --> 01:45:29,757
- YEAH, I GUESS,
IF YOU HAPPEN TO LIKE FLOWERS.

2227
01:45:36,163 --> 01:45:37,599
[sighs]

2228
01:45:37,632 --> 01:45:39,667
- HAVING A GOOD TIME, POP?
- [chuckles]

2229
01:45:39,701 --> 01:45:40,735
YOU KNOW, SKIPPER,

2230
01:45:40,768 --> 01:45:43,538
RIGHT NOW IS PRACTICALLY
THE FIRST MOMENT OF PEACE

2231
01:45:43,571 --> 01:45:45,607
I'VE HAD
SINCE WE LEFT TERRE HAUTE.

2232
01:45:49,577 --> 01:45:50,545
- POP?
- HMM?

2233
01:45:50,578 --> 01:45:51,779
- IT'S AMY.

2234
01:45:51,813 --> 01:45:53,080
- UH, WHERE'S SHE
BEEN KEEPING HERSELF?

2235
01:45:53,114 --> 01:45:55,850
I'VE HARDLY SEEN THE GIRL
SINCE WE GOT DOWN HERE.

2236
01:45:55,883 --> 01:45:56,984
- POP, YOU BETTER
TAKE A LOOK.

2237
01:45:57,018 --> 01:45:59,554
- NOT NOW.
- POP!

2238
01:45:59,587 --> 01:46:00,655
- ALL RIGHT, WHERE?

2239
01:46:00,688 --> 01:46:01,989
- YOU CAN'T MISS HER.

2240
01:46:02,023 --> 01:46:04,058
IT'S THAT LEOPARD DEAL
COMING DOWN THE BOARDWALK.

2241
01:46:04,091 --> 01:46:05,527
- OH, YOU MUST BE
MISTAKEN, SKIPPER.

2242
01:46:05,560 --> 01:46:08,362
THAT COULDN'T BE AMY.

2243
01:46:13,968 --> 01:46:15,403
NO...

2244
01:46:15,437 --> 01:46:17,371
NOT MY LITTLE GIRL.

2245
01:46:19,474 --> 01:46:21,676
[barking]

2246
01:46:21,709 --> 01:46:24,546
[men whistling]

2247
01:46:27,081 --> 01:46:28,983
- JUST WHAT DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE DOING?

2248
01:46:29,016 --> 01:46:30,585
- WELL, MR. O'MARA,

2249
01:46:30,618 --> 01:46:33,721
WON'T THE GIRLS IN PARIS
BE LONELY WITH YOU HERE?

2250
01:46:33,755 --> 01:46:34,989
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN THAT CREEPY SUIT?

2251
01:46:35,022 --> 01:46:37,592
- WILL YOU PLEASE
LET ME ALONE?

2252
01:46:37,625 --> 01:46:38,993
- I SUGGEST YOU DO
AS MADEMOISELLE WISHES.

2253
01:46:39,026 --> 01:46:40,662
- NOW, WHAT'S THE IDEA
EXPOSING YOURSELF

2254
01:46:40,695 --> 01:46:41,863
TO EVERYONE LIKE THAT?

2255
01:46:41,896 --> 01:46:43,197
- STRANGE--

2256
01:46:43,230 --> 01:46:46,601
I THOUGHT YOU LIKED YOUR GIRLS
EASY AND BREEZY.

2257
01:46:46,634 --> 01:46:48,135
WELL, MAYBE I'M JUST
A LITTLE BIT TIRED

2258
01:46:48,169 --> 01:46:51,439
OF BEING SWEET, SQUARE AMY
FROM TERRE HAUTE.

2259
01:46:51,473 --> 01:46:54,208
- SHUT UP AND GET
BACK TO THE HOTEL...

2260
01:46:54,241 --> 01:46:56,478
RIGHT NOW, AND PUT ON
SOMETHING DECENT.

2261
01:46:56,511 --> 01:46:57,979
- MONSIEUR, YOU ARE BECOMING
A NUISANCE.

2262
01:46:58,012 --> 01:46:59,847
- PLEASE, NICK.
- I SAID, PUT SOME CLOTHES ON,

2263
01:46:59,881 --> 01:47:02,917
AND I MEAN IT.

2264
01:47:02,950 --> 01:47:04,986
- WILL YOU LET ME GO?
- AMY!

2265
01:47:05,019 --> 01:47:07,722
HEY, FELLOWS, NOW--

2266
01:47:07,755 --> 01:47:09,991
AMY!

2267
01:47:10,024 --> 01:47:11,025
AMY.

2268
01:47:23,170 --> 01:47:25,039
AMY, YOU COME BACK HERE!

2269
01:47:28,175 --> 01:47:29,877
AMY!

2270
01:47:29,911 --> 01:47:32,179
AMY.

2271
01:47:38,052 --> 01:47:40,588
- THANKS.

2272
01:47:40,622 --> 01:47:42,890
HEY!

2273
01:47:42,924 --> 01:47:44,626
HEY.

2274

2276
01:48:28,035 --> 01:48:31,172
[engine turning]

2277
01:49:10,978 --> 01:49:13,981
- [crying]

2278
01:49:19,754 --> 01:49:22,790
- I'M SORRY, BABY,
SO VERY SORRY.

2279
01:49:24,792 --> 01:49:29,597
- I GUESS I'M JUST NOT
AS GROWN-UP AS I THOUGHT I WAS.

2280
01:49:29,631 --> 01:49:33,034
- I DON'T LIKE SEEING THINGS
LIKE THIS HAPPEN TO YOU.

2281
01:49:33,067 --> 01:49:36,771
I FEEL SO HELPLESS.

2282
01:49:36,804 --> 01:49:38,239
WHEN YOU WERE A LITTLE GIRL,
I ALWAYS KNEW WHAT TO DO,

2283
01:49:38,272 --> 01:49:41,108
BUT NOW I--

2284
01:49:41,142 --> 01:49:45,647
- ONLY ONE PERSON CAN HELP ME
NOW, DADDY, AND THAT'S ME.

2285
01:49:45,680 --> 01:49:48,049
I'M NEVER GOING
TO SEE NICK AGAIN.

2286
01:49:48,082 --> 01:49:50,017
YOU WERE RIGHT
ABOUT HIM ALL ALONG.

2287
01:49:50,051 --> 01:49:52,219
- I DON'T WANT
TO BE RIGHT, AMY.

2288
01:49:52,253 --> 01:49:53,988
I JUST WANT YOU
TO BE HAPPY.

2289
01:49:54,021 --> 01:49:57,158
I KNOW NOTHING I COULD SAY
RIGHT NOW COULD HELP.

2290
01:49:57,191 --> 01:50:00,227
ONLY ONE MORE DAY, BABY,
AND WE'LL BE LEAVING FOR HOME,

2291
01:50:00,261 --> 01:50:02,029
WHERE WE REALLY BELONG.

2292
01:50:02,063 --> 01:50:04,231
MAYBE WHEN WE GET BACK THERE,
ALL THIS WON'T SEEM

2293
01:50:04,265 --> 01:50:08,035
SO IMPORTANT, HMM?

2294
01:50:08,069 --> 01:50:10,938
- [crying]

2295
01:50:15,076 --> 01:50:17,111
- SO TOMORROW
WE'RE LEAVING FOR HOME.

2296
01:50:17,144 --> 01:50:20,147
[speaking French]

2297
01:50:22,083 --> 01:50:24,018
- OUI.

2298
01:50:24,051 --> 01:50:26,053
- BUT FIRST, MY WIFE--
MY FEMME AND I

2299
01:50:26,087 --> 01:50:28,322
ARE GOING TO HELP YOU FRANCAIS
CELEBRATE BASTILLE DAY.

2300
01:50:28,355 --> 01:50:30,024
TONIGHT WE'RE GOING
OUT ON THE TOWN.

2301
01:50:30,057 --> 01:50:32,126
UH, SUR LA VIE.
- OUI.

UH, WE'RE GOING TO SHOOT

2304
01:50:36,263 --> 01:50:38,766
[laughing] I DON'T KNOW
THE FRENCH FOR THAT.

2305
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:41,435
UNE PLUS GRANDE SOIREE.
- OUI, MONSIEUR.

2306
01:50:41,468 --> 01:50:43,104
- IT SURE IS A SHAME
I HAVE TO LEAVE FRANCE

2307
01:50:43,137 --> 01:50:44,772
JUST WHEN I'M GETTING
SO I CAN HANDLE THE LANGUAGE.

2308
01:50:44,806 --> 01:50:46,908
NE PAS?
JUST PUT IT THERE.

2309
01:50:46,941 --> 01:50:48,843
S'IL VOUS PLAIT.
- HI, POP.

2310
01:50:48,876 --> 01:50:51,412
- OH, BONJOUR, ELLIOTT.
WHAT'S NEW WITH YOU TODAY?

2311
01:50:51,445 --> 01:50:54,782
WELL, UH,
BONJOUR, MADEMOISELLE.

2312
01:50:54,816 --> 01:50:56,784
- DAD, YOU REMEMBER FLORELLE.

2313
01:50:56,818 --> 01:50:59,787
- NO.
- FROM THE BEACH.

2314
01:50:59,821 --> 01:51:01,388
- OH.

2315
01:51:01,422 --> 01:51:05,026
I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE HER
WITH HER--I MEAN, SHE--

2316
01:51:05,059 --> 01:51:06,794
WELL, HOW ARE
THE, UH, FRENCH LESSONS COMING?

2317
01:51:06,828 --> 01:51:10,364
- [sobbing]

2318
01:51:12,934 --> 01:51:15,737
- AND THIS IS HER MOTHER, DAD--
MADAME CLEBERT.

2319
01:51:15,770 --> 01:51:20,107
- YES, BONJOUR.

2320
01:51:20,141 --> 01:51:22,143
- YOUR SON, MONSIEUR,
WILL INFORM YOU

2321
01:51:22,176 --> 01:51:24,178
THAT WE ARE HERE
ON A MISSION.

2322
01:51:24,211 --> 01:51:27,048
- OH?
WHAT MISSION IS THAT?

2323
01:51:27,081 --> 01:51:29,917
- DAD, I--

2324
01:51:29,951 --> 01:51:31,052
- VERY WELL, MONSIEUR.

2325
01:51:31,085 --> 01:51:33,921
THEN IT IS MY DUTY TO SPEAK.

2326
01:51:33,955 --> 01:51:35,289
IT CANNOT BE DONE.

2327
01:51:35,322 --> 01:51:38,760
THE RICH AMERICAN CANNOT DO
THIS THING.

2328
01:51:38,793 --> 01:51:42,129
- WHAT CAN HE NOT DO?

2329
01:51:42,163 --> 01:51:45,199
- IT MAY SEEM NOTHING
IN YOUR COUNTRY, MONSIEUR.

2330
01:51:45,232 --> 01:51:47,735
BUT YOU WILL FIND
IT IS A COSTLY BUSINESS HERE.

2331
01:51:47,769 --> 01:51:49,937
- BUT WHAT IS?

2332
01:51:49,971 --> 01:51:51,272
- AH...
[chuckles]

2333
01:51:51,305 --> 01:51:53,074
HE SMILES.

2334
01:51:53,107 --> 01:51:55,409
HE MAKES AMERICAN JOKE.

2335
01:51:55,442 --> 01:51:59,280
IT IS NOT AMUSING, MONSIEUR,
YOU WILL FIND.

2336
01:51:59,313 --> 01:52:02,449
THE POLICE TAKE INTEREST
IN PROTECTING THE VIRTUE

2337
01:52:02,483 --> 01:52:04,051
OF MY DAUGHTER.
- POP, I--

2338
01:52:04,085 --> 01:52:05,787
- WOULD YOU SHUT UP,
RICH AMERICAN?

2339
01:52:05,820 --> 01:52:06,788
- BELIEVE ME, DAD,
I DIDN'T--

2340
01:52:06,821 --> 01:52:09,290
- WILL YOU PIPE DOWN, PLEASE?

2341
01:52:09,323 --> 01:52:11,158
GO ON, MADAME.

2342
01:52:11,192 --> 01:52:14,195
- [speaking French]

2343
01:52:17,098 --> 01:52:19,466
IF YOU WISH THE SCANDAL,

2344
01:52:19,500 --> 01:52:22,436
YOU MAY HAVE THE SCANDAL.

2345
01:52:22,469 --> 01:52:26,808
BUT YOU WISH TO CLOSE THE MATTER
WITHOUT A SCANDAL,

2346
01:52:26,841 --> 01:52:30,945
WE CAN DO SO WITH QUICKNESS.

2347
01:52:30,978 --> 01:52:33,815
- I SEE.

2348
01:52:33,848 --> 01:52:37,184
MADAME, UH, HOW CAN WE POSSIBLY
COMPENSATE YOU

2349
01:52:37,218 --> 01:52:41,789
FOR THE VIRTUE
OF YOUR DAUGHTER?

2350
01:52:41,823 --> 01:52:43,457
- DAD, IF I COULD JUST
SAY SOMETHING--

2351
01:52:43,490 --> 01:52:45,860
- HOW MUCH, MADAME?

2352
01:52:45,893 --> 01:52:47,328
- MONSIEUR COMPREND, YES.

2353
01:52:47,361 --> 01:52:50,264
HE DOES NOT GO WILD
IN THE EYE.

2354
01:52:50,297 --> 01:52:54,035
OH, MONSIEUR--
INTELLIGENT MAN.

2355
01:52:54,068 --> 01:52:56,303
- THANK YOU.

2356
01:52:56,337 --> 01:52:58,906
HOW MUCH?

2357
01:52:58,940 --> 01:53:01,208
- OUT OF THE WISDOM
OF HIS UNDERSTANDING,

2358
01:53:01,242 --> 01:53:03,444
WHICH I SEE DEMONSTRATION,

2359
01:53:03,477 --> 01:53:06,280
MY DAUGHTER AND MYSELF

2360
01:53:06,313 --> 01:53:11,185
LEAVE THIS MATTER IN THE HAND
OF THE SO INTELLIGENT...

2361
01:53:11,218 --> 01:53:13,087
[speaking French]

2362
01:53:13,120 --> 01:53:14,288
MONSIEUR.

2363
01:53:14,321 --> 01:53:17,591
- OH, WELL, FINE.

2364
01:53:17,624 --> 01:53:19,326
BECAUSE STRANGELY ENOUGH,
I FEEL THERE'S GOING TO BE

2365
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:23,164
A HAPPY ENDING
FOR BOTH FLORELLE AND MY SON.

2366
01:53:23,197 --> 01:53:24,165
- MONSIEUR?

2367
01:53:24,198 --> 01:53:26,567
- SIT DOWN, ELLIOTT.

2368
01:53:26,600 --> 01:53:29,937
MADAME, YOU HAVE MADE ME
A VERY HAPPY MAN.

2369
01:53:29,971 --> 01:53:32,073
MY SON WILL MARRY
YOUR DAUGHTER.

2370
01:53:32,106 --> 01:53:35,042
- MARRY?

2371
01:53:35,076 --> 01:53:36,243
- HEY, POP!
- YOU SHUT YOUR YAP.

2372
01:53:36,277 --> 01:53:39,146
THAT'S THE WAY WE DO THINGS
BACK IN TERRE HAUTE, MADAME.

2373
01:53:39,180 --> 01:53:40,547
YOU KNOW, FOR A WHILE THERE,
I WAS AFRAID

2374
01:53:40,581 --> 01:53:42,583
WE'D NEVER FIND A WIFE
FOR THIS BOY.

2375
01:53:42,616 --> 01:53:46,387
BUT YOUR LOVELY DAUGHTER IS
AN ANSWER TO A FATHER'S PRAYER.

2376
01:53:47,955 --> 01:53:52,093
- OH, MONSIEUR MAKES THE JOKES.
[laughs]

2377
01:53:52,126 --> 01:53:54,228
- NO, MONSIEUR DOES NOT
MAKE THE JOKE.

2378
01:53:54,261 --> 01:53:56,964
SIT DOWN, MADAME.
TAKE A LOAD OFF YOUR FEET.

2379
01:53:56,998 --> 01:53:58,432
MY WIFE SHOULD BE
HERE ANY MINUTE.

2380
01:53:58,465 --> 01:54:00,067
AS LONG AS YOU'RE GOING TO BE
IN THE FAMILY,

2381
01:54:00,101 --> 01:54:01,936
YOU MIGHT AS WELL
MEET US ALL, HUH?

2382
01:54:01,969 --> 01:54:04,271
- MAMA, HE SPEAKS
OF THE MARRIAGE?

2383
01:54:04,305 --> 01:54:07,942
- YES, THAT'S WHAT
HE SPEAKS OF.

2384
01:54:07,975 --> 01:54:09,610
- MONSIEUR IS...

2385
01:54:09,643 --> 01:54:13,147
HOW YOU SAY, COMICAL MAN?

2386
01:54:13,180 --> 01:54:15,182
HMM?
[laughs]

2387
01:54:15,216 --> 01:54:17,084
MONSIEUR MAKES THE JOKES.

2388
01:54:17,118 --> 01:54:21,088
- [chuckles nervously]

2389
01:54:21,122 --> 01:54:22,589
- NO, HE DOES NOT
MAKE THE JOKE.

2390
01:54:22,623 --> 01:54:24,225
MONSIEUR IS VERY SERIOUS.

2391
01:54:24,258 --> 01:54:25,559
- POP, I HATE
TO INTERRUPT YOU--

2392
01:54:25,592 --> 01:54:27,194
- WELL, THEN DON'T.

2393
01:54:27,228 --> 01:54:28,095
NOW, LET'S SEE, MADAME.

2394
01:54:28,129 --> 01:54:32,066
HOW OLD DID YOU SAY
YOUR DAUGHTER WAS?

2395
01:54:32,099 --> 01:54:34,235
WELL, SHE'S NOT AS YOUNG
AS SHE LOOKS, IS SHE?

2396
01:54:34,268 --> 01:54:36,370
BUT THAT'S ALL RIGHT,
AS LONG AS SHE'S A GOOD WORKER.

2397
01:54:36,403 --> 01:54:38,239
IS SHE STRONG?
- STRONG?

2398
01:54:38,272 --> 01:54:39,173
- YES, FOR THE FARM.

2399
01:54:39,206 --> 01:54:40,507
SHE'S GOING TO HAVE TO WORK
ON THE FARM.

2400
01:54:40,541 --> 01:54:42,176
- FARM?
- OH, YES, YES.

2401
01:54:42,209 --> 01:54:44,211
YOU SEE, MADAME, YOU'VE GOT
THE WRONG IDEA ABOUT AMERICANS.

2402
01:54:44,245 --> 01:54:45,679
THEY'RE NOT ALL RICH,
YOU KNOW?

2403
01:54:45,712 --> 01:54:48,049
NOW YOU TAKE US--WE'VE JUST GOT
THIS LITTLE ROCKY OLD FARM

2404
01:54:48,082 --> 01:54:49,283
BACK IN INDIANA.

2405
01:54:49,316 --> 01:54:51,953
NOW, OF COURSE, ON OUR FARM,
THE WOMEN DO MOST OF THE WORK.

2406
01:54:51,986 --> 01:54:54,188
LIKE, MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER WORK
FROM WAY BEFORE SUNUP

2407
01:54:54,221 --> 01:54:55,456
TO WAY AFTER SUNDOWN.

2408
01:54:55,489 --> 01:54:58,092
WE CAN SURE USE ANOTHER HAND.
NOW, HOW IS FLORELLE WITH COWS?

2409
01:54:58,125 --> 01:55:00,294
- COWS?

2410
01:55:00,327 --> 01:55:01,963
- WELL, HOW ABOUT SHEEP, THEN?

2411
01:55:01,996 --> 01:55:03,330
- SHEEP?
[speaking French]

2412
01:55:03,364 --> 01:55:05,967
WE JUST ESCAPED THE SHEEP.

2413
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,102
THAT IS WHY WE LEFT NORMANDY,
TO ESCAPE THE SHEEP.

2414
01:55:08,135 --> 01:55:10,704
- OH, WELL, THAT JUST SHOWS YOU
HOW LIFE GOES ROUND AND ROUND,

2415
01:55:10,737 --> 01:55:12,106
DOESN'T IT?

2416
01:55:12,139 --> 01:55:13,474
I'LL TELL YOU--
MAYBE WE'LL JUST PUT HER

2417
01:55:13,507 --> 01:55:15,076
IN CHARGE OF SLOPPING
THE HOGS, HUH?

2418
01:55:15,109 --> 01:55:16,177
- MAMA.

2419
01:55:16,210 --> 01:55:17,611
- I THINK THIS WHOLE
HAPPY OCCASION

2420
01:55:17,644 --> 01:55:19,080
CALLS FOR A CELEBRATION,
MADAME, HUH?

2421
01:55:19,113 --> 01:55:20,514
COME ON, NOW,
WE'LL HAVE SOME CHAMPAGNE.

2422
01:55:20,547 --> 01:55:22,716
COME RIGHT ALONG.

2423
01:55:22,749 --> 01:55:25,219
THIS IS THE WAY WE OPEN IT
OUT IN THE WILD WEST.

2424
01:55:25,252 --> 01:55:27,221
I HOPE THIS IS A GOOD YEAR.

2425
01:55:27,254 --> 01:55:29,056
I KNOW HOW FUSSY YOU FRENCH ARE
ABOUT YOUR CHAMPAGNE.

2426
01:55:29,090 --> 01:55:30,724
- OH, MONSIEUR.
- I BEG YOUR PARDON.

2427
01:55:30,757 --> 01:55:32,093
- [speaking French]

2428
01:55:32,126 --> 01:55:33,094
- WELL, FOU TO YOU
TOO, MADAME.

2429
01:55:33,127 --> 01:55:34,095
- [speaking French]

2430
01:55:34,128 --> 01:55:37,464
- OH, DON'T LEAVE.
THE PARTY'S JUST STARTED.

2431
01:55:44,338 --> 01:55:46,107
- YOU KNOW, I GOT TO HAND IT
TO YOU, POP.

2432
01:55:46,140 --> 01:55:47,708
SHE REALLY THOUGHT
YOU WERE FOU.

2433
01:55:47,741 --> 01:55:48,775
YOU KNOW WHAT FOU IS?

2434
01:55:48,809 --> 01:55:51,245
FOU IS THE FRENCH WORD
FOR CRAZY, POP.

2435
01:55:51,278 --> 01:55:52,980
- ELLIOTT--
- NO, POP!

2436
01:55:53,014 --> 01:55:54,515
NO!

2437
01:56:15,369 --> 01:56:17,171
- HELLO, DARLING.
- OH, HI, KATIE.

2438
01:56:17,204 --> 01:56:18,372
- DID YOU HAVE A NICE DAY?

2439
01:56:18,405 --> 01:56:19,773
- OH, JUST ROUTINE.

2440
01:56:19,806 --> 01:56:21,208
- OH, HARRY, I'M SO EXCITED.
THIS IS OUR NIGHT,

2441
01:56:21,242 --> 01:56:22,476
JUST THE TWO OF US--

2442
01:56:22,509 --> 01:56:24,645
ABSOLUTELY NO CHILDREN.

2443
01:56:24,678 --> 01:56:27,448
HARRY, IT'S GOING TO BE
THE MOST PERFECT EVENING....

2444
01:56:27,481 --> 01:56:31,052
WITHOUT ONE JARRING NOTE
TO SPOIL IT, NOT ONE.

2445
01:56:31,085 --> 01:56:33,287
- KATIE, I, UH--

2446
01:56:36,357 --> 01:56:39,126
- AND THAT INCLUDES RUDOLPH
AND HIS STUPID FLOWERS.

2447
01:56:39,160 --> 01:56:41,428
- BUT THOSE WERE--

2448
01:56:44,231 --> 01:56:46,233
MY FLOWERS.

2449
01:56:47,334 --> 01:56:50,337
[indistinct chatter]

2450
01:57:17,131 --> 01:57:19,433
WELL...

2451
01:57:23,170 --> 01:57:25,539
- HARRY, I MEANT WHAT I SAID.

2452
01:57:25,572 --> 01:57:27,108
I WANT THIS TO BE
A WONDERFUL EVENING,

2453
01:57:27,141 --> 01:57:29,076
AND IF YOU DO
ONE SINGLE THING TO SPOIL IT...

2454
01:57:29,110 --> 01:57:31,145
- I'M NOT GOING
TO SPOIL ANYTHING.

2455
01:57:44,125 --> 01:57:45,192
HEY, YOU'RE WINNING.

2456
01:57:45,226 --> 01:57:47,128
- YES, HOW'D YOU DO?
- I LOST IT ALL.

2457
01:57:47,161 --> 01:57:48,262
- OH, HERE.

2458
01:57:48,295 --> 01:57:50,264
- OH, THANK YOU, I'LL GIVE YOU
AN I.O.U. LATER, OKAY?

2459
01:57:50,297 --> 01:57:52,566
I THINK I'LL TRY A LITTLE
CHEMIN DE FER.

2460
01:58:45,452 --> 01:58:49,456
- AH, THE HUSBAND, AS USUAL.

2461
01:58:52,226 --> 01:58:55,796
I WOULDN'T TRY ANYTHING VIOLENT
IF I WERE YOU, MR. WILLARD.

2462
01:58:55,829 --> 01:58:58,165
I'M A MASTER OF KARATE.

2463
01:59:01,502 --> 01:59:03,537
[all screaming]

2464
01:59:30,731 --> 01:59:32,699
- I CAN FIND MY OWN WAY OUT.

2465
01:59:39,540 --> 01:59:40,674
WELL, OUT THE BACK DOOR, HUH?

2466
01:59:40,707 --> 01:59:43,410
WELL, THANKS
VERY MUCH, FELLOWS.

2467
01:59:43,444 --> 01:59:45,346
WELL, GOOD EVENING.

2468
01:59:45,379 --> 01:59:47,748
TELL ME, DO EITHER
OF YOU FELLOWS SPEAK ENGLISH?

2469
01:59:47,781 --> 01:59:49,250
I MEAN, UH--

2470
01:59:49,283 --> 01:59:52,519
WELL, YOU DON'T.

2471
01:59:52,553 --> 01:59:53,954
YOU KNOW, I DON'T BELIEVE
I'VE EVER BEEN

2472
01:59:53,987 --> 01:59:55,689
IN THIS PART
OF TOWN BEFORE.

2473
01:59:55,722 --> 01:59:58,559
IT'S AWFULLY NICE OF YOU
TO SHOW ME AROUND LIKE THIS.

2474
01:59:58,592 --> 02:00:00,761
YOU SHOULDN'T GO
TO ALL THIS TROUBLE.

2475
02:00:00,794 --> 02:00:03,597
MY, THIS IS CERTAINLY
A WONDERFUL PLACE, ISN'T IT?

2476
02:00:09,603 --> 02:00:11,238
OH, I'LL TELL YOU.
WELL--

2477
02:00:11,272 --> 02:00:14,308
WELL, YOU COULD JUST DROP ME
ANYPLACE ALONG HERE, FELLOWS.

2478
02:00:14,341 --> 02:00:16,377
AFTER ALL, THIS IS--
THANKS VERY MUCH, FELLOWS.

2479
02:00:16,410 --> 02:00:18,579
WELL, WAIT A MINUTE.

2480
02:00:30,056 --> 02:00:33,994
- [speaking French]

2481
02:00:39,333 --> 02:00:41,302
IT'S ALL RIGHT, MR. WILLARD.
HE SAID YOU COULD COME WITH ME.

2482
02:00:41,335 --> 02:00:43,270
- WELL, THANKS.

2483
02:00:43,304 --> 02:00:44,971
- THEY, UH, DON'T LIKE
UNFAVORABLE PUBLICITY

2484
02:00:45,005 --> 02:00:47,974
AT THE CASINO, SO THEY TURN
UNDESIRABLE CHARACTERS

2485
02:00:48,008 --> 02:00:49,443
OVER TO THE FRENCH POLICE
THIS WAY.

2486
02:00:49,476 --> 02:00:50,544
- HOW DO YOU MEAN?

2487
02:00:50,577 --> 02:00:53,580
WELL, THAT LITTLE CAFE THERE
IS SMACK ON THE BORDER.

2488
02:00:53,614 --> 02:00:56,650
THE FRONT DOOR'S IN MONACO,
AND THE BACK DOOR'S RIGHT HERE

2489
02:00:56,683 --> 02:00:58,051
ON THE BORDER OF FRANCE.
IT'S DONE ALL THE TIME.

2490
02:00:58,084 --> 02:00:59,620
- YEAH.

2491
02:00:59,653 --> 02:01:00,954
WELL, I'VE GOT TO LET
MY WIFE KNOW

2492
02:01:00,987 --> 02:01:01,888
WHAT HAPPENED
TO ME SOME WAY.

2493
02:01:01,922 --> 02:01:04,958
- I SENT HER BACK
TO THE HOTEL IN A TAXI.

2494
02:01:04,991 --> 02:01:06,960
- WELL, I APPRECIATE THAT.

2495
02:01:06,993 --> 02:01:10,030
I'M SORRY TO HAVE CAUSED
YOU SO MUCH TROUBLE.

2496
02:01:10,063 --> 02:01:13,467
- HOP IN. I'LL DRIVE YOU BACK
TO THE HOTEL.

2497
02:01:24,411 --> 02:01:26,913
I GOT A FEW QUESTIONS
I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU, SIR.

2498
02:01:26,947 --> 02:01:28,849
- ALL RIGHT, NICK.

2499
02:01:28,882 --> 02:01:32,453
MAYBE THERE ARE A COUPLE
I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU TOO.

2500
02:01:32,486 --> 02:01:33,654
- WHY'D YOU SOCK HIM?

2501
02:01:33,687 --> 02:01:34,988

THAT'S EASY.

2502
02:01:35,021 --> 02:01:36,990
HE HAD IT COMING.

2503
02:01:37,023 --> 02:01:38,659
- YOU DID IT BECAUSE
YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH YOUR WIFE,

2504
02:01:38,692 --> 02:01:39,660
DIDN'T YOU?

2505
02:01:39,693 --> 02:01:42,028
- YEAH.

2506
02:01:42,062 --> 02:01:43,530

- HONEST...

2509
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,403
22 YEARS.

2510
02:01:49,436 --> 02:01:52,706
THE SAME WOMAN--
YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH HER.

2511
02:01:52,739 --> 02:01:54,441
I MEAN, YOU DON'T JUST LOVE HER,
NOT JUST THAT.

2512
02:01:54,475 --> 02:01:55,909
YOU ARE IN LOVE WITH HER.

2513
02:01:55,942 --> 02:01:56,977
- THAT'S RIGHT.

2514
02:01:57,010 --> 02:01:58,845
- THAT'S WHY
YOU SOCKED HIM, HUH?

2515
02:01:58,879 --> 02:02:01,648
- SURE.
AND I'D DO IT AGAIN.

2516
02:02:01,682 --> 02:02:03,116
YOU WANT TO TURN AROUND
AND GO BACK, I'LL SHOW YOU.

2517
02:02:03,149 --> 02:02:07,854
- [chuckles]

2518
02:02:07,888 --> 02:02:10,090
- CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION NOW?

2519
02:02:10,123 --> 02:02:11,858
- SHOOT.

2520
02:02:11,892 --> 02:02:14,060
- TELL ME...

2521
02:02:14,094 --> 02:02:16,129
WHAT'S GOING ON
BETWEEN YOU AND AMY?

2522
02:02:16,162 --> 02:02:17,731
I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU
THAT BUSINESS

2523
02:02:17,764 --> 02:02:20,901
ABOUT "A FATHER HAS A RIGHT,"
BUT I'D LIKE TO KNOW.

2524
02:02:20,934 --> 02:02:22,569
- I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN.

2525
02:02:22,603 --> 02:02:23,570
- TRY.

2526
02:02:23,604 --> 02:02:26,440
- WELL, IT GOES
A LONG WAY BACK.

2527
02:02:26,473 --> 02:02:30,043
I'M JUST GETTING IT
STRAIGHT MYSELF.

2528
02:02:30,076 --> 02:02:32,679
YOU SEE, I NEVER MET ANYONE
LIKE YOU BEFORE,

2529
02:02:32,713 --> 02:02:35,816
LIKE AMY EITHER.

2530
02:02:35,849 --> 02:02:39,085
WHEN SHE LEFT PARIS,
MY WORLD FELL APART.

2531
02:02:39,119 --> 02:02:41,588
I BEGAN TO THINK I WAS
REALLY IN LOVE, MR. WILLARD,

2532
02:02:41,622 --> 02:02:44,825
I MEAN, REALLY IN LOVE.

2533
02:02:44,858 --> 02:02:46,427
BUT I KNEW THAT WAS
A PHONY IDEA.

2534
02:02:46,460 --> 02:02:47,528
AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT
I KEPT TELLING MYSELF,

2535
02:02:47,561 --> 02:02:49,129
'CAUSE I KNEW BETTER.

2536
02:02:49,162 --> 02:02:51,064
YOU FOLLOW ME?

2537
02:02:51,097 --> 02:02:52,466
- GO ON.

2538
02:02:52,499 --> 02:02:54,701
- WELL, I FOLLOWED AMY
DOWN FROM PARIS.

2539
02:02:54,735 --> 02:02:56,069
AND YOU SAW
WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

2540
02:02:56,102 --> 02:02:58,004
SHE BOUGHT THAT
STUPID BATHING SUIT

2541
02:02:58,038 --> 02:03:01,074
'CAUSE SHE THOUGHT IT MADE HER
INTO THE KIND OF GIRL I WANTED.

2542
02:03:01,107 --> 02:03:03,076
I DON'T KNOW WHAT CAME OVER ME.

2543
02:03:03,109 --> 02:03:04,144
GOT HER OUT IN THAT BOAT.

2544
02:03:04,177 --> 02:03:06,647
I TOLD HER SHE WAS NOTHING
BUT A POOR LITTLE HICK,

2545
02:03:06,680 --> 02:03:08,715
THAT YOU WERE ALL HICKS,
WHO DIDN'T KNOW

2546
02:03:08,749 --> 02:03:10,551
THE FIRST THING ABOUT REALITIES,
THAT YOU WERE ALL

2547
02:03:10,584 --> 02:03:11,985
RUINING HER LIFE, AND SHE
COULD CHOOSE RIGHT THEN

2548
02:03:12,018 --> 02:03:14,187
BETWEEN YOU AND ME.

2549
02:03:14,220 --> 02:03:16,590
YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED THEN.

2550
02:03:31,772 --> 02:03:34,875
I'M THE WORLD'S WORST,
MR. WILLARD.

2551
02:03:34,908 --> 02:03:36,677
YOU HAD ME PEGGED
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING,

2552
02:03:36,710 --> 02:03:38,479
DIDN'T YOU?

2553
02:03:38,512 --> 02:03:39,713
- WELL, I--

2554
02:03:39,746 --> 02:03:41,147
- AFTER 22 YEARS,
YOU'RE STILL IN LOVE

2555
02:03:41,181 --> 02:03:43,049
WITH YOUR WIFE, AREN'T YOU?

2556
02:03:45,218 --> 02:03:47,954
I WOULDN'T HAVE BELIEVED
THAT WAS POSSIBLE.

2557
02:03:47,988 --> 02:03:51,858
- NICK, WHY DON'T YOU COME IN
AND TALK TO AMY?

2558
02:03:55,762 --> 02:04:00,066
ANYTHING YOU WANT ME
TO TELL HER?

2559
02:04:00,100 --> 02:04:02,736
- NO.

2560
02:04:02,769 --> 02:04:04,671
I'M, UH, GOING
BACK TO NEW YORK.

2561
02:04:04,705 --> 02:04:07,007
I'M GOING TO TAKE
THAT LOUSY JOB.

2562
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:10,877
WHO KNOWS? MAYBE I CAN MAKE
SOMETHING OUT OF MYSELF.

2563
02:04:22,923 --> 02:04:24,024
- GOOD-BYE, NICK.

2564
02:04:24,057 --> 02:04:27,561
- TAKE CARE OF AMY,
MR. WILLARD.

2565
02:04:27,594 --> 02:04:29,863
SEE THAT SHE'S, UH...

2566
02:04:29,896 --> 02:04:32,599
WELL, YOU KNOW,
JUST TAKE CARE OF HER, HUH?

2567
02:04:32,633 --> 02:04:34,000
- I WILL, NICK.

2568
02:04:37,237 --> 02:04:40,607
- WHY COULDN'T I HAVE HAD
AN OLD MAN LIKE YOU?

2569
02:04:52,118 --> 02:04:53,820
- DADDY?

2570
02:04:53,854 --> 02:04:54,888
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

2571
02:04:54,921 --> 02:04:56,590
WE'VE BEEN SO WORRIED
ABOUT YOU.

2572
02:04:56,623 --> 02:04:57,991
- OH, YEAH, I'M ALL RIGHT.

2573
02:04:58,024 --> 02:05:01,995
DIDN'T YOU SEE WHO THAT WAS?

2574
02:05:02,028 --> 02:05:04,030
HE SAID HE WAS GOING
TO NEW YORK.

2575
02:05:04,064 --> 02:05:07,133
HE SAID SOMETHING
ABOUT TAKING THAT LOUSY JOB.

2576
02:05:07,167 --> 02:05:10,571
- WELL,
FOR GOODNESS SAKES, DADDY,

2577
02:05:10,604 --> 02:05:14,140
STOP LOOKING AT ME LIKE THAT.

2578
02:05:14,174 --> 02:05:16,710
- WELL, DOESN'T THAT MEAN
ANYTHING TO YOU?

2579
02:05:16,743 --> 02:05:19,546
- OH, OF COURSE IT DOES.

2580
02:05:19,580 --> 02:05:23,950
WELL, WHAT DO YOU EXPECT
ME TO DO, FALL APART?

2581
02:05:23,984 --> 02:05:27,020
GIVE YOURSELF
A LITTLE CREDIT, DADDY.

2582
02:05:27,053 --> 02:05:31,992
YOU RAISED A GIRL
WITH SOME GUMPTION.

2583
02:05:32,025 --> 02:05:35,128
- WELL, AMY, I--
- HEY, POP!

WE HEARD ABOUT
THE BIG RHUBARB--WHAM!

2585
02:05:37,197 --> 02:05:38,164

2586
02:05:38,198 --> 02:05:40,000
THEY SAID YOU PRACTICALLY
WRECKED THE CASINO

2587
02:05:40,033 --> 02:05:41,902
WITH ONE PUNCH.
- YEAH!

2588
02:05:41,935 --> 02:05:45,606
- WELL, NOT THE WHOLE CASINO,
BUT NEVER MIND THAT.

- SHE'S OVER THERE.

2591

- I THINK I'M IN TROUBLE.

2592
02:05:57,250 --> 02:05:58,752
- OH, UH, AMY?

2593
02:05:58,785 --> 02:06:00,587
- OH, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT ME, POP.

2594

I'M GOING OUT
WITH MY TWO BROTHERS TONIGHT.

OF YOUR OWN PROBLEMS.

- I DIDN'T MEAN
TO SPOIL YOUR EVENING.

2600

IT'S STILL BY ALL ODDS,
ON ALL COUNTS

2602
