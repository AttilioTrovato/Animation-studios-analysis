1
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:49,024
Help! Help!

2
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:52,194
Somebody, help!

3
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:02,814
Help! Help!

4
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:06,901
- Help! Help!
- Help! Get us out of here!

5
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:09,279
- We're trapped!
- Francis?

6
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,448
Help! Help!

7
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:13,507
- Help! Help!
- Help!

8
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:18,095
- Help! Help!
- Somebody get us out!

9
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:33,569
What happened?

10
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,239
She's hit something.

11
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:39,783
Have mercy!

12
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,940
I can't get it open. It's jammed.

13
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,781
You first, Fritz.

14
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,259
Ernst, help your mother.

15
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,682
Captain Wilhelm?

16
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,977
Anybody here?

17
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,924
Anyone there, Fritz?

18
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,926
If anybody was here,

19
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,970
they'd have heard us long before this.

20
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,805
It's just as I was telling you.

21
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,224
If they've abandoned the ship,
they've got no right to claim it.

22
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:04,060
It's ours by maritime law.

23
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,563
I can't believe that they'd go off
and leave us here.

24
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,690
Something must've happened.

25
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,775
Something's happened, all right.

26
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,027
They thought the ship
was gonna sink in the storm.

27
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:14,696
It was every man for himself.

28
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,239
It was carrying too much sail.

29
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,241
I heard the captain and mate arguing
down below.

30
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,285
If I'd been captain,
I'd have fought the pirates,

31
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,412
instead of running into the storm.

32
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:23,887
All right, Mother.

33
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,676
What a mess.

34
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:44,700
At least we're not too far from land.

35
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:47,577
Then there's hope.

36
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,566
Maybe when we get to shore
we can get some help,

37
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:52,874
make her sail again.

38
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:56,044
She'll never sail again.

39
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:01,451
Maybe we could build a raft.
We've got enough wood.

40
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,244
Fritz is right.

41
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:05,246
The sooner we get ashore, the better.

42
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:07,723
Hey! Look what I found.

43
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:18,134
Look!

44
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:20,136
Oh, those poor things.

45
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:23,905
They must have had a worse time of it
than we did.

46
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,439
How's it look?
Are we solid on the rocks?

47
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:35,235
I don't know. No, I'd say we're...

48
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:39,447
Well, we're here at least
until the turning of the tide.

49
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:43,201
Help me, somebody, help! Help!

50
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,039
No!

51
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:51,960
Look what I found! The captain's dogs!

52
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,837
And are they glad to see me! Whoa!

53
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:57,882
- He's all right.
- Duke, Turk, get off me.

54
00:05:57,982 --> 00:05:59,441
Better make a start. Come on.

55
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,946
Come on, give me a hand.

56
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:12,021
Now suppose it's a deserted island.

57
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:15,817
Now I can work out right where we are
soon as I learn how to use this.

58
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:17,943
All right, take it along.

59
00:06:19,642 --> 00:06:21,129
It still works.

60
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,241
There's no time for that now.

61
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,456
Why don't we put up a distress flag?

62
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:33,376
Don't you think
we look distressed enough?

63
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:36,713
Ernst, anyone who sees
a ship stuck on the rocks,

64
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,189
might possibly guess it's in trouble.

65
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:54,162
Now you look after them, Turk.
You too, Duke.

66
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:02,613
But I don't see how
we can take all these animals.

67
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:03,990
We're not taking them.

68
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,034
But we can't leave them here,
Father, they'll die.

69
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,661
When your mother and brothers
are safe on land,

70
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:12,055
then you can talk to me
about the animals, not before.

71
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,084
Francis, get them out of there.

72
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:17,712
- We don't want this one or that.
- Wait a minute!

73
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:18,838
Or that.

74
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,215
Wait a minute, they wanna go too.

75
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:23,733
We don't want any of them.

76
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:33,144
All right, Fritz.

77
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:36,105
Put it over your head. That's it.

78
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,690
All right, I'm fine.

79
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,025
Just hold tight. Grip the rope here.

80
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,459
Ernst.

81
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,283
- All right.
- Come on, Mother.

82
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:49,259
Now, Mother, don't worry.
We'll take care of you.

83
00:07:49,359 --> 00:07:52,929
- Right, Mother, now don't worry.
- Right, Fritz.

84
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:55,098
- Come on.
- Now.

85
00:08:07,369 --> 00:08:10,322
- Sorry, Mother.
- You all right?

86
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,230
Hey, Fritz! The dogs!

87
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,023
He forgot the dogs!

88
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:20,691
They're not coming with us.

89
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:24,237
- Cast off, Fritz.
- They're my dogs! I found 'em.

90
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,405
Francis, sit down.

91
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,589
They weigh more than any of us.
We'd sink in no time at all.

92
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:32,286
- All right, Fritz?
- All right.

93
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:34,679
All right. Watch that wreckage!

94
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:03,333
Here comes the dogs, going to swim it.

95
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,702
Come on, Duke! Come on, Turk!

96
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:15,872
You can make it!
Come on, boys! Keep swimming!

97
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:20,042
Straight between those rocks.
That side, Ernst, that side!

98
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:22,644
Never mind that side!
Come on. Help me push over here!

99
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:38,186
Come on, boys!
You can make it! Keep swimming!

100
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:41,105
Look out, Ernst! Watch those rocks!

101
00:09:42,295 --> 00:09:45,224
- Your side, Ernst!
- Push off!

102
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:49,588
Come on, Turk! Come on, Duke!

103
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:56,052
Look out! Look out!

104
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:06,229
Do something! They'll drown!

105
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:10,025
We can't take any more chances.

106
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:12,485
Look!

107
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,590
Come on, boys! Come on!

108
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,338
Good boy, Turk! Well done.

109
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:50,258
Keep them in the middle.

110
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,051
That's right, in the center.

111
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:55,096
You see, they didn't sink us.

112
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,764
Let's get to shore.

113
00:10:56,864 --> 00:11:00,351
I wouldn't dare pray for any
more miracles, not in one day.

114
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:02,619
Fritz, the wave in the front there.

115
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:30,548
Hey, Turk, Duke! Wait for me!

116
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:35,011
I'm coming too! Hey! Wait for me!

117
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,306
Francis, come back! Stay in your tub.

118
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:39,950
I'm coming! Hey!

119
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:43,978
I'm coming! I'm coming, Duke!

120
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,855
Francis, come back here!

121
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,857
Tie it around the tree stump.

122
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:51,360
- Come on, let's go.
- Francis!

123
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,821
Francis, come back here!

124
00:11:59,137 --> 00:12:01,343
See ya later.

125
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:07,251
First thing we've got to do is
to unload the raft.

126
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:08,977
Then...

127
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:12,605
put up some sort of shelter
for the night.

128
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:15,859
Not the first thing.

129
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,235
Fritz. Hold it, Fritz.

130
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:36,030
We are not making any progress.

131
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,948
I know it, Father.

132
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:41,369
It's got to hang down even
on both sides.

133
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:42,912
Aren't very good.

134
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,872
We're lucky to have them.

135
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,681
Pull your side down.

136
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:49,001
Right, I've got my side.

137
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,269
- Hold it down, Fritz.
- Right.

138
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:56,357
Come on.

139
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,487
You're very lucky to have them,
you know.

140
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,872
Fritz, I think tomorrow,

141
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:29,583
if the ship's still there,

142
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,919
you and I and maybe Ernst
ought to go out

143
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:34,171
and try and bring in the animals
if we can,

144
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:37,633
anything else we might need.

145
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,567
How long do you think
we'll have to stay here?

146
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,362
Well, I don't know, Mother. I just...

147
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,658
I just think we ought to
do everything we can.

148
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,360
What's going on?

149
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,030
Powder was wet.

150
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:07,280
Aren't you coming to bed?

151
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,002
You have to have some sleep.

152
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:23,796
Besides it's going to rain.

153
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,382
No, I'm all right.

154
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:42,758
No one can ever go back

155
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:46,095
and undo what's already done but...

156
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,180
Well, I...

157
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,031
I want you to know that...

158
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:53,034
Well, I'm sorry things didn't work out.

159
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:56,704
Not the way I wanted them to.

160
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,652
I know.

161
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:05,463
It would have been so much better
if we'd just stayed in Bern.

162
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,703
I'm not so sure of it,

163
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:14,555
not with Napoleon Bonaparte
trying to grab up more and more.

164
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:19,060
Fritz and Ernst might both be in a war,

165
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,271
maybe even you.

166
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:26,218
No, it would have been better
to stay and face things

167
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,345
rather than just...

168
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:30,071
running away.

169
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:35,436
Is it running away
to try to find a new life

170
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,161
in a new colony?

171
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:41,358
To try to give our sons
a chance to live,

172
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,485
a chance to be free?

173
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:45,253
Is that running away?

174
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:49,491
I keep thinking about all the men

175
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:53,287
who work in those other
offices along the Marktgasse.

176
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:56,540
They go on working at the same old jobs

177
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,294
and manage to find opportunities
for their families

178
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:03,521
without running off
to the other side of the world.

179
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:08,776
I thought we settled all this
before we left home.

180
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:12,363
It was a good thing we set out to do.

181
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:14,949
We were right.

182
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:18,911
All that hasn't changed just
because we were shipwrecked.

183
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,259
You're always right, aren't you?

184
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:36,705
We'll get there, I'm sure of it.

185
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,139
I'm sure of it!

186
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,392
Sooner or later,
there's bound to be a ship.

187
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,980
I'll pray for it
with every breath I take.

188
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:50,443
It's... It's a big land, New Guinea.

189
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:55,391
For hundreds of years,
there've been new colonies,

190
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,366
a great new world to build.

191
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,328
No limit to what a man can do.

192
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,899
Just because we're
a couple of months late

193
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:05,708
getting there won't matter.

194
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:09,363
We're not too badly off, are we?

195
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:12,282
We've got each other.
We've got the family.

196
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:15,077
- Food to eat.
- And even a tent to keep the rain off...

197
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,678
If we had sense enough to use it.

198
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,599
Oh, the dogs.

199
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:25,504
- Here, Duke!
- Try to keep covered up.

200
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:28,757
Now, don't worry.
Try to go back to sleep.

201
00:18:31,463 --> 00:18:33,280
I'm soaked!

202
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:55,883
Having trouble?

203
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,245
Oh, I'll get it down,

204
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,012
but it may take a while.

205
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:09,048
Easy.

206
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:14,318
- Easy.
- Fritz, wait a minute.

207
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:18,140
Hold him. Hold him.

208
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,991
Easy!

209
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:29,417
I keep trying to tell her
it's for her own good.

210
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:31,695
- A ship!
- What?

211
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:33,322
- There's a ship!
- Come on!

212
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,991
Ahoy! Ahoy there!

213
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:38,035
I think they've seen us. Ahoy!

214
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:41,497
Ahoy! Ahoy!

215
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,916
Ahoy! Ahoy!

216
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,725
Ahoy!

217
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,487
Take a look, Fritz.

218
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,768
There's something
on the sail. I can't...

219
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:07,147
I knew it. It's the pirate ship
that chased us into the storm.

220
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:09,358
Get down. Ernst, get down!

221
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,043
And I deliberately tried
to get their attention.

222
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:16,073
At least this time we have something
to fight back with.

223
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,867
- Do you know how to fire it?
- I think so.

224
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:21,010
Let's pull it back.

225
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:28,210
I'll get a keg of powder.

226
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:31,270
See if you can find some rags
we can use for wadding.

227
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,358
I know. I'll be right back.

228
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:00,117
We only have one shot.

229
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,843
Let's wait till we can't possibly miss.

230
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,984
What's happening?

231
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:36,168
They're leaving. They're going away.

232
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:40,548
Do you think they saw us loading
the cannon and got scared off?

233
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:45,037
Pirates scared off
by one cannon and three people?

234
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,221
Do you know what they're up to, Father?

235
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:54,963
- What's that?
- That? Oh, that's a quarantine flag,

236
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:57,049
warning that there's black death aboard.

237
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,384
How did you know that?

238
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:01,637
Well, I do a bit
of reading too, you know.

239
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,362
Come on, Fritz.

240
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:14,608
- Pull those new lines tight, Ernst.
- Right.

241
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,110
There, that's it. There.

242
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:38,689
Oh, no. What's the matter with you?

243
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:46,405
Not that way, stupid, this way.

244
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:54,982
Maybe we tried too much for one trip.

245
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,415
We had to try.

246
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:10,262
Sharks. Sharks!

247
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:25,486
- You got one!
- Watch that one coming in!

248
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:29,558
- There's another one!
- I'll get it!

249
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,727
I hit it!

250
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,577
Here comes another one!

251
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:46,841
Get out of here.

252
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:49,176
Got them.

253
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,850
Look out, Ernst! There's another!

254
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,396
No, it isn't. It's a turtle.

255
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,232
Probably disturbed him with our shots.

256
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:12,366
I think we scared them away.

257
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:28,215
He's pulling us.

258
00:24:42,033 --> 00:24:46,066
It's better to use your head
than break your back, I always say.

259
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:52,239
Francis, see if you can find the...

260
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:57,328
Francis, where are you?

261
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:02,526
Here, Duke, Turk. Here, boys!

262
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,254
Francis?

263
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:12,259
Where's Francis? Go find him.

264
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,515
Now, you wait just one minute

265
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:20,601
and I'll have some sugarcane for you.

266
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:25,564
Now, come on, little fella,
I won't hurt you.

267
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:34,698
Now just let me fix this.

268
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:42,540
Here, little elephant. Come here.

269
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:46,403
That's right.

270
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:50,464
Come on, little elephant.
I wouldn't hurt you.

271
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,910
Come on, little fella.

272
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:56,011
I wouldn't hurt you.

273
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:01,418
I have some nice fresh
sugarcane for you.

274
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:03,978
Come on, come on.

275
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:12,971
Come on. Come on.

276
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:15,390
Just a little closer.

277
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:17,783
That's right.

278
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:24,832
Come on, little fella.

279
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:29,529
Francis, where are you? Francis?

280
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:33,549
Now you just put your foot right there.

281
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:40,347
Come on, little elephant,
a little closer.

282
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:44,419
Just a little bit closer.

283
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:46,353
Right...

284
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:55,029
Now, stop pulling!

285
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:01,619
What's the ma...

286
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,663
Francis! Francis!

287
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:16,842
You, get outta here!

288
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:21,930
Francis!

289
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,672
Francis, where are you?

290
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:30,882
You get away from my elephant!

291
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:32,801
Get out, he's my elephant!

292
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:12,841
Duke! Turk! Come on!

293
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,900
You beat him enough.

294
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:22,601
- Oh, good old Duke.
- Good boy.

295
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:25,270
Did I tell you
you could leave the beach?

296
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,439
Don't you know you
might have been eaten

297
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,940
wandering off that way?

298
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,318
Well, what do you have
to say for yourself?

299
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:33,966
I'm sorry, but...

300
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:36,171
But what?

301
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,050
Can I keep the baby elephant anyhow?

302
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,307
Now, I'll keep ya.

303
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:57,025
Come on, Rocky, get going.

304
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:07,202
All right, Francis, hold it.

305
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:10,330
Slack off a bit.

306
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:16,545
Come on, Rocky, back up.
Good fella, back up.

307
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:18,464
Right.

308
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:20,591
Hold it.

309
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:24,970
- That was a good idea of yours, Ernst.
- Thanks, Fritz.

310
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:31,685
Come on, boy.

311
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:35,423
Come on. Come on.

312
00:29:36,238 --> 00:29:37,783
Here.

313
00:29:38,952 --> 00:29:42,305
Fritz, no more full planks,
just some odds and ends.

314
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:44,448
I think we got enough here, Father.

315
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:50,579
Well, what do you think of it?

316
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:56,903
I'd like it a lot better if I knew
tigers couldn't climb trees.

317
00:29:57,003 --> 00:30:00,365
They won't climb this one
by the time we're finished with it.

318
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:03,759
You've probably never seen
such a house as this is going to be.

319
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:06,011
I'm sure of that.

320
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:13,294
The world is full of nice,
ordinary little people,

321
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:16,297
who live in nice, ordinary little houses

322
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:17,882
on the ground.

323
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:20,844
But didn't you ever dream of
having a house up in a treetop?

324
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:24,238
No, mostly I dream of having
a house in New Guinea.

325
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:31,771
You must think we're going to be here
for quite a long time.

326
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:33,773
This I have no way of knowing.

327
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:37,152
But we can't sit on the beach
just waiting for a ship to come by.

328
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:38,919
But there could be a ship.

329
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:41,255
Of course.

330
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:46,161
Then I think we ought to try
to light the signal fire.

331
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:50,373
Just forget about the pirates?

332
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:53,752
Maybe they won't come back.
Maybe we could get away with it.

333
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,337
We can't take that chance.

334
00:30:56,437 --> 00:31:00,607
Right now being alive is more
important than being found.

335
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:16,524
Don't look down.

336
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:18,610
All right, Mother, I've got you.

337
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,695
Well, what do you think?

338
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:23,031
Fritz, can I sleep with you tonight?

339
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:24,657
What an idea.

340
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:26,743
It isn't exactly built for two, Francis.

341
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:28,995
- But I'll give you a swing.
- Oh, good!

342
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:31,873
Fritz, be careful. Take this rope...

343
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:33,792
And tie it around his waist!

344
00:31:35,208 --> 00:31:36,643
Mother!

345
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:43,551
- Getting on, aren't we?
- Yes.

346
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:46,054
Oh, no, Fritz, you let me out.
No, Fritz. No.

347
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:48,348
Here, I want to show you something.

348
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:51,392
Oh, faster, faster.

349
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:55,021
Look, this is our room.

350
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:57,106
You're not going to get me
to go up there

351
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:59,067
unless you make some sort of railing.

352
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,653
But you don't understand.
It's going to be like a real house.

353
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:05,114
You know, enclosed.
This is your own circular stairway.

354
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:08,383
Let's go back down before
someone falls off the edge.

355
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:14,123
- Come on, Francis.
- He'll be all right, Mother.

356
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:16,084
Let me go first.

357
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:37,021
Come on, little fella,
I wouldn't hurt you.

358
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:39,482
I just want to pet you.

359
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:41,708
Come on, come on.

360
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:44,419
Francis!

361
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:50,451
Francis! Hold him, Ernst!

362
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:52,344
I've got him!

363
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,840
- He caught it!
- You all right, Francis?

364
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:07,218
- Yes, he's my new pet.
- Aw, look at him.

365
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:10,138
- Don't let him go.
- Hey, you should feel his heart beating.

366
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:12,807
Mine could match his beat for beat.

367
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:15,143
Supposing I hadn't just
happened to insist

368
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:17,979
that he have this rope
tied around his waist?

369
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:20,732
Until you get some sort of railing
put up or something

370
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:24,918
I don't want Francis back up here and
I assure you I won't be up here either.

371
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:29,949
I'm sorry, dear.
I don't blame you for being upset.

372
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:33,786
You don't seem to understand
what we have in mind.

373
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:36,998
- No, but won't you trust us?
- Do what you like about this place.

374
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:41,169
Just see that Francis is on the ground
and I assure you I won't be back up here.

375
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,838
All right, all right, we'll do that.

376
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:47,425
You stay back in camp.
And when we've got everything fixed up

377
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:48,927
just the way we want it,

378
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:51,528
then we'll bring you back,
see how you feel about it.

379
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:58,201
Don't you think
you can talk to me like that.

380
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,191
But how much further do we have to go?

381
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,485
Hurry, Mother.
You're gonna love this new house.

382
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:09,405
Now this way, Mother,
wait'll you see what we've done.

383
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:11,532
I really think you're gonna like it.

384
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:15,594
You just wait.

385
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:17,872
We must be there now.

386
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:19,290
Wait till you see this, Mother.

387
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,542
- I can't wait.
- Take off the blindfold.

388
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:23,143
I can hardly wait.

389
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:25,812
Oh!

390
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:35,306
Oh. Just a moment, please,
old Swiss custom.

391
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:39,668
- Carry the bride across the threshold.
- Father.

392
00:34:40,628 --> 00:34:43,269
Duke, Turk, get outta my way.

393
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:54,049
How's this?

394
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,708
All the latest innovations,
running water,

395
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:04,768
genuine imported tortoise shell.

396
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:15,695
And not forgetting the cooler.

397
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:28,985
This is Ernst's contribution.
He invented it. He and Fritz built it.

398
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:33,614
See how it works, Mother. Look,
big wheel turns the little wheel up there.

399
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:37,452
The cup pours the water into the shell.
It runs down the bamboo,

400
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:40,178
and feeds the sink and the cooler.

401
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:44,891
I... I can't believe it.

402
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:53,567
Darling, thank you.

403
00:35:57,613 --> 00:36:00,198
I'm second. I go after Mother.

404
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:04,744
Hey.

405
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:10,417
- Thank you.
- Up you go.

406
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,631
Up there's the boys' room.

407
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:33,440
And look.

408
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,261
This is something I worked out.

409
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:40,306
When you're in for the night,
turn the wheel.

410
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:43,450
Pull up your stairs.

411
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:48,272
Not only keeps out wild animals,

412
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:50,858
but any neighbors who might
become a nuisance, you know,

413
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:52,527
always wanting to borrow.

414
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:55,363
We'll be troubled so much by them.

415
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,297
Hey, get me down.

416
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,677
Oh.

417
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:10,310
Remember this? I built it for us.

418
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:45,746
Don't tell me you,

419
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:47,748
you pull this to ring for the butler!

420
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:51,768
Here, I'll show you.

421
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,700
Now, you can lie here
and look at the stars.

422
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:17,377
Don't you remember?

423
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,714
That summer we went to Interlaken?

424
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:27,288
You said that someday
if you could have your wish,

425
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:30,390
you would sleep each night
so you could see the stars.

426
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:38,189
What is it? What's wrong?

427
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,151
These curtains don't belong in here.

428
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:45,431
Well, they're from the captain's cabin.

429
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:47,157
We thought you'd like them.

430
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,733
It's so wonderful. I don't deserve it.

431
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:58,335
I can't believe it.

432
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:03,824
Don't worry about the curtains.

433
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:05,409
If you don't like them,

434
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:07,411
I know a woman who can fix anything.

435
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:09,054
Oh.

436
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:16,420
My heart was an island

437
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:21,509
On a stormy sea

438
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:25,972
'Til my golden ship

439
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:30,685
Of dreams came to me

440
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,520
La, la

441
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:35,314
La, la, la

442
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:37,400
La, la

443
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,111
La, la

444
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:44,031
Filled with the wildest dreams

445
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:46,049
Of love...

446
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:57,003
Here it is. "Tiger.

447
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:59,547
"Panthera Tigris. Native of Asia.

448
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:02,216
"Ranges north to Siberia

449
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:06,053
"and south to India
and the Malay peninsula."

450
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:08,139
That can only mean one thing,
a land bridge.

451
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,850
That's how there came to be
so many different kinds of animals

452
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,075
on one island.

453
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:15,578
Well, how do you know it's an island?

454
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:18,623
Why couldn't it be a peninsula?

455
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:23,863
Well, why don't you let us
try and sail around it?

456
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:26,256
You know how your mother
feels about that.

457
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:29,076
Well, it's just as I was telling Fritz.

458
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:32,455
Now, I think there used to be
a land bridge between here and Asia,

459
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:33,831
and this is all that's left of it.

460
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:36,000
Now that would explain
how so many different types of animals

461
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,252
came to be trapped here.

462
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:41,339
What do you think, Fritz? Do you agree?

463
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:44,816
Well, I suppose there could have
been one a long time ago.

464
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:48,012
There's only one way to find out.

465
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:50,222
Why don't you ask Mother again, Father?

466
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:51,599
Maybe she'll change her mind.

467
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:54,602
After all, mother wants to get to
New Guinea as much as we do.

468
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,437
There might be something there,

469
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:59,774
a village or an outpost,
someplace where ships come in.

470
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:04,612
Well, if the occasion presents itself,
I might possibly bring it up again.

471
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:07,156
What's this, spelling competition?

472
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:10,034
"Tiger, bear, elephant."

473
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:12,912
That's the list of animals
we've identified so far.

474
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:16,064
"Hyena, monkey, lizard."

475
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:22,520
Ostrich.

476
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:25,091
Help!

477
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:29,762
Help!

478
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:32,056
- Francis!
- Help!

479
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:33,724
Francis, let go!

480
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:37,603
I can't let go or he'll get away!

481
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:40,038
Let him go anyway. We'll catch him.

482
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:44,083
Francis!

483
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:47,420
Head her over this way!

484
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:50,616
- Are you all right, Francis?
- Yes, I'm all right.

485
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:52,410
Are you all right, Francis?

486
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,636
Not a mark on him that won't wash off.

487
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:59,083
- Grab his neck!
- We can learn to ride him.

488
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,768
Ride him? Let me try,
somebody help me up.

489
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:05,131
I think we'd better
get him trained a bit first.

490
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:08,259
- Let me try it then.
- All right, all right.

491
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:12,570
I get to try next.

492
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:16,142
I got him. I got him. Hold on!

493
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:18,826
Hold on! Hold on!

494
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:21,371
Oh, you sillies.

495
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:42,267
Here I go! Whee!

496
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:45,103
Watch out for that rock.

497
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:47,467
Yeah!

498
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:53,152
No fair stopping.
You gotta keep swinging.

499
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:02,537
Francis, come on.
Come on, everybody. Follow the leader.

500
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:13,339
Fritz.

501
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:17,453
Come on, I'll race you down.

502
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:24,801
Mother, look at me!

503
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:29,715
Go ahead, Father. You can do it.

504
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:31,482
Me? Well, of course, I can.

505
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:34,694
Whoa!

506
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:40,450
Here I come!

507
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:43,437
Where're we going, Ernst?

508
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:45,371
Wait and see.

509
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:48,317
Come on!

510
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:52,947
Hey, look at the monkeys, look!

511
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:55,840
- What?
- Oh, yeah. Look at 'em swinging.

512
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,787
Look at that one.

513
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:01,413
Well, I can do that.

514
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:02,998
- I bet you can't.
- Well, let's see you try.

515
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:04,891
Anyone can change hands.

516
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:09,479
- Now steady, Fritz.
- Go on, Fritz.

517
00:44:16,036 --> 00:44:18,071
He's done it!

518
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:22,017
- My turn next.
- No, no, it's my turn.

519
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:24,035
After me, after me.

520
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:39,550
Are you all right?

521
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:46,917
Never better. See what I mean?

522
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:54,383
You really are very graceful.

523
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:56,526
Thank you very much, Mother.

524
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:05,686
Don't you sometimes feel

525
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:08,121
that this is the kind of life
we were meant to live on this earth?

526
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:09,690
Ya-hoo!

527
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:11,567
Everything we need,

528
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:13,876
everything's right here,
right at our fingertips.

529
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:15,795
You know,

530
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:18,073
if only people could

531
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:20,993
have all this and be satisfied,

532
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:24,095
I don't think there'd be any
real problems in the world.

533
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:27,765
Or any future generations.

534
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,963
There isn't everything we need
right at our fingertips.

535
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:34,673
Now what are you talking about?

536
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:38,135
This, it's wonderful for today, I know,

537
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:39,928
but what about tomorrow?

538
00:45:40,028 --> 00:45:42,222
What about our sons?

539
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:44,224
What future is there here for them?

540
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:46,644
Now don't worry about tomorrow.
It'll take care of itself.

541
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:48,520
Suppose we should
never get away from here.

542
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:51,164
They'd never know what
it was like to... To be married.

543
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:56,153
Yes, it... Yes, that's right.

544
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:57,571
Now you come to mention it,

545
00:45:57,671 --> 00:45:59,505
there aren't many girls around here,
are they?

546
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:02,743
It's not anything to joke about.

547
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:06,512
Suppose they never have a chance
to know what it's like to have a family.

548
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:09,541
What you're trying to say is,

549
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:12,586
we ought to make every possible effort
to get away from here.

550
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:15,188
- Exactly.
- Right.

551
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:18,926
Then I'll tell the boys we've decided
to let them sail around the coast.

552
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:22,195
- See what they can find.
- That's not what I said at all.

553
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:26,199
Sooner or later,
we're going to have to face it.

554
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:30,938
But what do they know about
sailing and outrigging and...

555
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:32,455
Do you think it's safe?

556
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:35,750
We can't hold onto them forever.

557
00:46:45,093 --> 00:46:48,288
Come on, Rocky, you can pull it faster.
Come on, pull!

558
00:46:48,388 --> 00:46:50,943
- Straight ahead. Straight ahead.
- Pull. Come on.

559
00:46:51,043 --> 00:46:53,810
Fritz, grab ahold. That's it.

560
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:02,720
We'll be back soon and
maybe we'll find a ship to take us away.

561
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,513
- Oh.
- Don't worry, Mother.

562
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:06,948
Oh, be careful, Fritz.

563
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:12,479
Drop it, Ernst.

564
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:14,288
Francis, get Rocky clear.

565
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:18,459
Back up, back up.

566
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:23,949
Well, it's gonna be up to you, Fritz.

567
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:28,537
If you run into a storm
or trouble of any kind,

568
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:32,458
I'm relying on your judgment,
your good sense.

569
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:34,725
Make sure you both get safely back.

570
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:37,838
Come on, come on, Rocky, let's go.

571
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:39,840
- Good-bye, Ernst.
- Good-bye, Mother.

572
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:43,177
- You got nothing to worry about.
- Remember to use your head.

573
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:44,845
Yippee!

574
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:51,534
Ya-hoo!

575
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:58,791
Good luck.

576
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:08,509
Don't worry.
They'll be back before you know it.

577
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:12,631
I hope we are doing the right thing.

578
00:48:12,731 --> 00:48:15,626
- Letting them go.
- I'm sure we are.

579
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:17,878
Perhaps we ought to have
let 'em go sooner.

580
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:20,130
We might have been
in New Guinea by this time.

581
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:22,549
Bye, Fritz. Bring me back a crocodile.

582
00:48:22,649 --> 00:48:25,067
- Good-bye.
- Bye.

583
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:29,048
Oh, Fritz, I wish Mother could see
this place. She'd love it.

584
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:31,493
You know what I'd like?

585
00:49:31,593 --> 00:49:34,496
I'd like to see some
real mountains once again.

586
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:36,081
Walk the Oberland.

587
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:39,058
Stand looking up at Jungfrau
when a storm moves in.

588
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:42,421
Remember how you could
sort of smell the snow in the air?

589
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:46,633
Yeah. Fritz, do you ever
think about where you'd be,

590
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:49,068
what you'd be doing
if you'd have stayed in Bern?

591
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:51,805
Sometimes.

592
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:54,224
I think about Herr Kobel. What he said.

593
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:56,393
That I should attend the academy.

594
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:58,327
Fine chance you would have had.

595
00:49:59,037 --> 00:50:01,288
Well, you can't tell.
It might have worked out.

596
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:04,484
I'll tell you
where I'd really like to be.

597
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:08,822
Walking down the Nydeggasse
like on a Sunday after church...

598
00:50:08,922 --> 00:50:12,383
And all the girls stroll past
all dressed up.

599
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:14,969
Any one in particular?

600
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:17,513
No, nobody special.

601
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,418
Maybe you don't even know them,
maybe you don't speak.

602
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:24,630
But you look and they look
and you just know they're there.

603
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:27,716
Fritz, listen, do you think
when we get to New Guinea,

604
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:29,984
if we ever do,
there'll be any girls our age?

605
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:34,014
By the time we get to New Guinea,
we won't care what age they are!

606
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:55,926
Ernst, get the sail down quick!

607
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:02,626
Keep down!

608
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:05,337
What's the matter, Fritz?
What happened?

609
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:07,897
Quick, give me the glass.

610
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:11,650
There's something moving
over there, on the beach.

611
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:16,822
Pirates!

612
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:24,815
I'm sure it's the same one we scared off
with the quarantine flag.

613
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:27,359
- Let's try to sneak in a little closer.
- Oh, yeah!

614
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:30,461
If we stay behind the rocks,
they won't be able to see us.

615
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:52,900
- Ernst, bring the bow around.
- I'm trying!

616
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:36,136
That chest they just opened,

617
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:39,238
it belonged to my first officer,
God rest his soul.

618
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:42,074
I wish they'd fight
and kill each other off.

619
00:52:48,181 --> 00:52:50,682
You let me do any talking.

620
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:59,076
No, no. No, no, leave him!
Put him down!

621
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:02,579
Kuala, listen to me. Kuala?

622
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:06,249
You, boy? You born how long?

623
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:07,871
He is 14 years.

624
00:53:17,402 --> 00:53:21,181
Leave him alone. Leave the boy alone.

625
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:22,823
Kuala, wait!

626
00:53:23,375 --> 00:53:27,995
You will want me to write a ransom note.

627
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:29,788
I write.

628
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:35,753
My people send money if you let me go.

629
00:53:37,505 --> 00:53:40,325
You send plenty money.

630
00:53:40,425 --> 00:53:41,993
Then you go.

631
00:53:42,093 --> 00:53:45,622
Wait! Leave the boy with me

632
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:48,208
or I not write ransom note.

633
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:50,851
No boy, no note.

634
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:12,164
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Bertie.

635
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:15,292
Sorry to have gotten you into this.

636
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:20,073
We'll... We'll get out of...

637
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:22,826
Out of this somehow.

638
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:26,345
Now keep as still as you can.
You'll only make things worse.

639
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:36,897
Now they'll have to decide which crew
is going to take us.

640
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:39,467
Ernst,

641
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:42,304
I think we could sneak in there
and free the old man and the boy

642
00:54:42,404 --> 00:54:44,571
before the others knew
what was happening.

643
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:47,199
All right.

644
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:50,520
It's now or never.

645
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:52,371
Come on!

646
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:56,693
At least I think
they'll keep us together.

647
00:55:09,731 --> 00:55:12,209
Don't make any noise.

648
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:13,418
Who are you?

649
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:26,306
Who are you?

650
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:29,100
We've come to help you.
If only we had a knife.

651
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:32,536
Quick, don't bother with me.
Get the boy free first.

652
00:55:33,621 --> 00:55:35,205
Well, go on!

653
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:39,527
They won't harm me.
I'm valuable for ransom.

654
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:40,753
Get Bertie free.

655
00:56:02,233 --> 00:56:03,969
Get away if you can.

656
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:07,222
If they ransom me,
I'll get a ship and come back for you.

657
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:08,765
I won't leave without you.

658
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:13,994
Get away quickly.
Don't waste time on me. Go on!

659
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:21,877
- Run!
- Run, Ernst! Run!

660
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:24,364
No, I won't go!

661
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:28,467
Go on, leave me! Leave me!

662
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:00,999
Come on!

663
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:04,878
I can't go on another step.

664
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:29,486
In here.

665
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:57,806
Pirates took your ship?

666
00:57:59,267 --> 00:58:01,628
What were you, cabin boy?

667
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:20,829
You mean the old gentleman back there
is your grandfather?

668
00:58:26,252 --> 00:58:27,987
Come on.

669
00:58:28,087 --> 00:58:31,324
Who are you anyway?
Where did you come from?

670
00:58:31,624 --> 00:58:34,003
We were shipwrecked...

671
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:15,910
Ernst? Ernst!

672
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:25,978
Run, run!

673
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:42,411
- Come on.
- Come on!

674
01:00:26,247 --> 01:00:28,233
They're leaving. They're going away!

675
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:31,209
It could be a trick
to get us to come back...

676
01:00:32,086 --> 01:00:34,588
You know, like the Greeks
and the Trojan horse.

677
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:38,175
I think we'll stay here until daylight.

678
01:00:41,262 --> 01:00:43,581
Probably save a lot of time
cutting across the island

679
01:00:43,681 --> 01:00:45,599
instead of going back around the beach.

680
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:48,211
There's no question about it now.
This is an island.

681
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:52,465
What about me? What am I going to do?

682
01:00:52,565 --> 01:00:54,441
I guess you'll come with us.

683
01:00:55,193 --> 01:00:57,736
Right about that direction
should take us home.

684
01:00:58,696 --> 01:00:59,931
But my grandfather?

685
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:02,892
If they release him, he's bound
to come back here to look for me.

686
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:05,603
Well, don't worry about it.
He knows you're with us.

687
01:01:05,703 --> 01:01:08,189
If we're not here,
he'll just sail around the island.

688
01:01:08,289 --> 01:01:12,860
He couldn't get a ship past our place
unseen even if he wanted to.

689
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:15,295
Come on, Bertie.
You can have the middle.

690
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:17,422
Come on.

691
01:01:19,884 --> 01:01:22,803
I'll just sit up. Not sleepy.

692
01:01:43,450 --> 01:01:46,611
Fritz? Fritz!

693
01:01:46,711 --> 01:01:50,481
Do you imagine we've changed a lot
since we first landed here?

694
01:01:50,581 --> 01:01:52,483
- In what way?
- Well, lots of ways!

695
01:01:52,583 --> 01:01:55,028
Like getting stronger,
more sure of ourselves, things like that.

696
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:56,362
I suppose so.

697
01:01:56,462 --> 01:01:58,823
Remember the first night we came here?

698
01:01:58,923 --> 01:02:02,050
Everything scared us...
All those strange noises.

699
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:04,370
How could I forget.

700
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:06,471
We must've been helpless.

701
01:02:06,597 --> 01:02:08,374
That I'd have to agree with.

702
01:02:08,474 --> 01:02:12,978
Fritz, listen. You don't think
we were something like him?

703
01:02:15,481 --> 01:02:16,982
I don't think so.

704
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:21,804
- Did you get a good look at his hands?
- I'll bet he's never done anything.

705
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:24,223
A wealthy family,
probably an only child.

706
01:02:24,323 --> 01:02:25,892
Sometime,
get a look at the way he walks.

707
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:26,976
I did.

708
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:30,328
And back home, we used to call
Jean Monteau a sissy.

709
01:02:30,455 --> 01:02:33,524
Do you remember the other afternoon we
were wishing we could see some girls?

710
01:02:33,624 --> 01:02:34,609
Yeah?

711
01:02:34,709 --> 01:02:37,153
I don't think we could have
come much closer to getting our wish

712
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:38,780
and still miss it completely.

713
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:14,232
That direction!
That's the way we've gotta go, Fritz.

714
01:03:14,332 --> 01:03:16,109
Right. We'll cross here.

715
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:17,944
Doesn't look as though
it'll be over our heads.

716
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:20,295
Do we have to cross just here?

717
01:03:21,881 --> 01:03:23,491
It's easy. Take off your clothes.

718
01:03:23,591 --> 01:03:25,509
Carry them over your head.

719
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:28,220
It's better than walking around
for hours in wet clothes.

720
01:03:28,346 --> 01:03:30,555
It's just until we get across
the deep part here.

721
01:03:31,557 --> 01:03:32,682
I can't swim.

722
01:03:34,769 --> 01:03:36,295
I don't think you'll have to.

723
01:03:36,395 --> 01:03:37,604
Now come on, get started.

724
01:03:57,667 --> 01:04:00,403
I'm going back to the beach
to wait for my grandfather.

725
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:01,795
Don't come any closer!

726
01:04:03,214 --> 01:04:05,032
- Are you out of your mind?
- Stay back!

727
01:04:05,132 --> 01:04:07,744
That's my gun!
You've got no right to take it.

728
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:11,330
I'm sorry, Ernst, but I have
more need of it than you have.

729
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:14,099
I'll see my grandfather
makes it all right with you.

730
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:17,712
Wait!

731
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:20,272
You keep his attention.
I'll slip around behind him.

732
01:04:20,898 --> 01:04:22,315
I'll keep his attention!

733
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:28,347
You, Bertie!

734
01:04:28,447 --> 01:04:30,782
Put that down or I'll let this go!

735
01:04:33,244 --> 01:04:34,494
Drop it!

736
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:41,293
Don't do that, Ernst. I'll shoot!

737
01:04:49,468 --> 01:04:52,413
I don't want to shoot you, Ernst.
Now put that down!

738
01:05:01,063 --> 01:05:02,314
Let go of me!

739
01:05:06,819 --> 01:05:08,194
Stop it!

740
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:16,661
Let me take him on, Fritz!
I'll teach him to shoot at me.

741
01:05:17,663 --> 01:05:20,066
It was my fault the gun went off.
She didn't mean to fire.

742
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:21,692
I don't care. I could've been...

743
01:05:21,792 --> 01:05:24,711
What did you say? "She didn't..."

744
01:05:28,215 --> 01:05:29,799
It's a girl!

745
01:05:30,676 --> 01:05:33,162
Why would a girl dress up like that?

746
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:35,931
It was because of the pirates.

747
01:05:38,643 --> 01:05:42,687
My grandfather made me cut my hair
and dress like this because...

748
01:05:44,899 --> 01:05:46,566
Because he didn't want them to know.

749
01:05:50,696 --> 01:05:53,365
At least now you can wash your face.

750
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:58,354
Well, it will be nice
to be called Roberta again.

751
01:05:58,454 --> 01:06:02,567
I'm... I'm sorry, but if we would've known
you were a girl, I mean,

752
01:06:02,667 --> 01:06:06,279
- we wouldn't have...
- We'll try to make it easy for you.

753
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:08,171
As much as possible.

754
01:06:12,718 --> 01:06:14,662
Careful.

755
01:06:14,762 --> 01:06:17,180
- Give me your hand.
- Thank you.

756
01:06:18,724 --> 01:06:21,518
- Careful... Roberta.
- Watch your step.

757
01:06:22,853 --> 01:06:23,853
Oh.

758
01:06:28,192 --> 01:06:29,651
Thank you, Fritz.

759
01:06:46,627 --> 01:06:49,363
Variations and deviations
are two completely different things.

760
01:06:50,548 --> 01:06:52,116
Well, like here, Roberta.

761
01:06:52,216 --> 01:06:55,661
You see, variations can be
compensated for mathematically.

762
01:06:55,761 --> 01:06:59,305
But deviations, you never know
when they're going to happen.

763
01:07:00,307 --> 01:07:02,209
Wait till my grandfather
gets to know you.

764
01:07:02,309 --> 01:07:04,728
He'll put you to work
navigating one of his ships.

765
01:07:06,647 --> 01:07:08,174
Would you like that?

766
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:10,108
Maybe. Someday.

767
01:07:10,943 --> 01:07:13,012
I'd like to finish school first, though.

768
01:07:13,112 --> 01:07:14,612
Do you like the sea, Fritz?

769
01:07:17,116 --> 01:07:18,768
I like things you can depend on.

770
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:20,645
The sea? You can never be sure of it.

771
01:07:20,745 --> 01:07:23,038
Well, that's the fun of it,
not being sure of things.

772
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,778
"The winds aloud howl o'er the masts.

773
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:31,280
"And sing through every shroud.

774
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:34,116
"Pale, trembling, tired,

775
01:07:34,216 --> 01:07:37,078
"the sailors freeze with fears.

776
01:07:37,178 --> 01:07:40,305
"And instant death
on every wave appears."

777
01:07:41,557 --> 01:07:42,807
Homer's Iliad.

778
01:07:44,435 --> 01:07:47,004
Oh, I think that's one of the most
beautiful things ever written.

779
01:07:47,104 --> 01:07:48,923
The first night,
when we were caught in the storm,

780
01:07:49,023 --> 01:07:51,316
I was thinking of those lines
over and over.

781
01:07:52,193 --> 01:07:53,651
Do you read a lot, Fritz?

782
01:07:54,361 --> 01:07:55,554
Who? Him?

783
01:07:55,654 --> 01:07:58,299
He practically doesn't even read at all.

784
01:07:58,899 --> 01:08:02,994
Never really needed to. Sooner or later
Ernst tells me everything he knows.

785
01:08:24,266 --> 01:08:27,253
I think we're getting off course, Fritz.

786
01:08:27,353 --> 01:08:30,605
We should bear more to the right.

787
01:08:37,196 --> 01:08:39,030
It's all right. He won't hurt you.

788
01:08:49,041 --> 01:08:50,443
It's gone.

789
01:08:50,543 --> 01:08:51,543
- Oh.
- Come on.

790
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:57,423
Stay close to me.

791
01:09:59,945 --> 01:10:01,112
Get out of it quick!

792
01:10:08,621 --> 01:10:10,231
Ernst, do something!

793
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:13,651
The knife! Get the knife!

794
01:10:13,751 --> 01:10:15,919
Ernst, the knife! The knife!

795
01:10:26,388 --> 01:10:27,513
Ernst, hurry.

796
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:34,854
Hurry, Ernst!

797
01:10:49,161 --> 01:10:50,396
Hit the head!

798
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:52,163
I can't find it!

799
01:10:57,503 --> 01:10:59,337
Here, here, here!

800
01:11:00,339 --> 01:11:02,173
Here. I'm holding it.

801
01:11:30,536 --> 01:11:31,953
Now!

802
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:46,592
I'm sorry I took so long to find it.

803
01:11:57,771 --> 01:11:59,272
It was horrible.

804
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:04,777
Let's go back.

805
01:12:05,738 --> 01:12:07,405
Please let's go back!

806
01:12:08,824 --> 01:12:12,368
It keeps getting worse and worse.

807
01:12:16,582 --> 01:12:18,583
I think the worst is behind us now.

808
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:23,838
Here, give me your hand.

809
01:12:28,427 --> 01:12:31,387
Oh, no! My compass, it's gone!

810
01:12:34,391 --> 01:12:36,142
I don't even know where to look!

811
01:12:43,025 --> 01:12:45,443
I guess we'll have
to get along without it.

812
01:12:46,278 --> 01:12:47,513
Get along without it?

813
01:12:47,613 --> 01:12:50,156
We wouldn't have a chance.
We need that compass.

814
01:12:50,949 --> 01:12:53,018
We don't necessarily need a compass.

815
01:12:53,118 --> 01:12:55,521
I think I can do
just about as well without it.

816
01:12:55,621 --> 01:12:58,190
You think?
You could be wrong, you know?

817
01:12:58,290 --> 01:13:00,609
All right, I don't think it. I know it.

818
01:13:00,709 --> 01:13:04,363
And from now on, Ernst, you're
just going to have to trust my judgment.

819
01:13:04,463 --> 01:13:05,797
Come on.

820
01:13:39,748 --> 01:13:41,582
How's it feel now, Roberta?

821
01:13:43,335 --> 01:13:44,836
I don't care what he says.

822
01:13:46,296 --> 01:13:48,172
I can't go on day after day.

823
01:13:50,008 --> 01:13:52,135
We have to go on.
We've got no other choice.

824
01:13:53,470 --> 01:13:55,414
We're lost, Fritz, and you know it.

825
01:13:55,514 --> 01:13:57,291
We're not lost. We're not going to be.

826
01:13:57,391 --> 01:14:00,502
Fritz, if you want to go on, go ahead.

827
01:14:00,602 --> 01:14:02,353
Ernst and I have decided not to.

828
01:14:03,230 --> 01:14:04,439
You've what?

829
01:14:05,524 --> 01:14:08,276
Well, we can find the river
and follow it back to the coast.

830
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:11,513
Anyway, it's two against one.

831
01:14:11,613 --> 01:14:13,766
I wouldn't care
if it were ten against one.

832
01:14:13,866 --> 01:14:16,435
I'm the one who's got to get us back
and I'm going to.

833
01:14:16,535 --> 01:14:19,537
Look, just because you're older
doesn't mean you're always right.

834
01:14:25,711 --> 01:14:26,945
What are you doing?

835
01:14:27,045 --> 01:14:28,906
I'll just take charge
of the pistol for a while.

836
01:14:29,006 --> 01:14:30,532
I seem to remember
it being appropriated

837
01:14:30,632 --> 01:14:33,452
once before when somebody wanted
to go back to the beach.

838
01:14:33,552 --> 01:14:35,178
You give me back my pistol!

839
01:14:39,391 --> 01:14:40,766
Watch yourself!

840
01:14:43,979 --> 01:14:45,271
Oh, Fritz, Ernst, stop it!

841
01:14:51,236 --> 01:14:53,321
All right,
you can have your pistol back.

842
01:14:54,698 --> 01:14:56,407
But you know
you only have a few shots left.

843
01:14:57,201 --> 01:14:59,243
How far do you think you'd get?

844
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,318
There isn't any decision to make.

845
01:15:06,418 --> 01:15:07,960
We've got to keep going.

846
01:15:10,214 --> 01:15:11,990
I suppose we'd better go with him.

847
01:15:12,090 --> 01:15:13,341
Do you think you can?

848
01:15:14,384 --> 01:15:15,426
I'll try.

849
01:16:11,483 --> 01:16:13,484
Hey! Hey, hey!

850
01:16:15,612 --> 01:16:17,196
Run! Get out! Hey!

851
01:16:18,198 --> 01:16:19,308
Get away!

852
01:16:20,659 --> 01:16:22,493
Go on! Go away, go away!

853
01:16:25,872 --> 01:16:28,332
Go away! Go on!

854
01:16:32,170 --> 01:16:34,005
Get away! Go on!

855
01:16:40,887 --> 01:16:43,347
You really got yourself into a mess.

856
01:16:45,851 --> 01:16:47,602
All right, boy. I won't hurt you.

857
01:16:49,187 --> 01:16:52,106
Easy, boy, easy. We'll get you out.

858
01:17:00,532 --> 01:17:03,101
- Oh!
- If we can get him out of here,

859
01:17:03,201 --> 01:17:05,286
maybe you won't have to walk
all the way.

860
01:17:10,667 --> 01:17:12,668
Not that way. You'll never get him out.

861
01:17:22,721 --> 01:17:25,264
I'll get some more branches,
make a path for him.

862
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:36,385
Now, at a time like this,
you gotta use your head.

863
01:17:36,485 --> 01:17:38,903
- Come on.
- Here you are.

864
01:17:44,410 --> 01:17:48,438
Oh, Christmas tree
Oh, Christmas tree

865
01:17:48,538 --> 01:17:51,942
Thy leaves are so unchanging

866
01:17:52,042 --> 01:17:55,988
Oh, Christmas tree
Oh, Christmas tree

867
01:17:56,088 --> 01:18:00,284
Thy leaves are so unchanging

868
01:18:00,384 --> 01:18:04,246
Not only green when summer's here

869
01:18:04,346 --> 01:18:08,792
But also when 'tis cold and drear

870
01:18:08,892 --> 01:18:12,754
Oh, Christmas tree
Oh, Christmas tree

871
01:18:12,854 --> 01:18:14,464
Thy leaves are so...

872
01:18:20,353 --> 01:18:22,938
Must've got wet coming over.

873
01:18:23,690 --> 01:18:26,435
I don't see how you ever
managed to get it ashore.

874
01:18:26,535 --> 01:18:30,079
Well, I couldn't have done it alone.
Fritz and Ernst helped. I...

875
01:18:37,963 --> 01:18:40,157
Merry Christmas.

876
01:18:40,257 --> 01:18:41,966
Merry Christmas.

877
01:18:46,930 --> 01:18:49,640
Are we ever gonna open up
these other packages?

878
01:18:50,767 --> 01:18:52,351
Those are for Fritz and Ernst.

879
01:18:53,395 --> 01:18:55,646
But suppose they don't come back?

880
01:18:56,940 --> 01:18:58,383
Suppose they got "et" up?

881
01:18:58,483 --> 01:19:03,180
Francis, it's been a long day
and it's past your bedtime.

882
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:05,990
But it's Christmas.

883
01:19:12,330 --> 01:19:13,956
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

884
01:19:15,083 --> 01:19:17,877
- I'll come up and say good night.
- All right.

885
01:19:46,573 --> 01:19:49,617
How often has the Christmas tree

886
01:19:50,911 --> 01:19:55,148
Afforded me the greatest glee

887
01:19:55,248 --> 01:19:58,944
Oh, Christmas tree
Oh, Christmas tree

888
01:19:59,044 --> 01:20:02,447
Much pleasure thou canst give me

889
01:20:02,547 --> 01:20:04,423
It's Fritz and Ernst!

890
01:20:05,342 --> 01:20:07,176
What've you got there?

891
01:20:08,094 --> 01:20:10,763
But also when it's cold and drear

892
01:20:10,889 --> 01:20:12,124
Did you bring my crocodile?

893
01:20:12,224 --> 01:20:15,961
Oh, Christmas tree
Oh, Christmas tree

894
01:20:16,061 --> 01:20:19,673
Thy leaves are so unchanging

895
01:20:19,773 --> 01:20:21,800
What've you got there?

896
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:24,469
We thought you got "et" up
or something!

897
01:20:24,569 --> 01:20:26,471
- Hey!
- Merry Christmas!

898
01:20:26,571 --> 01:20:28,432
Merry Christmas!

899
01:20:28,532 --> 01:20:30,809
- Francis.
- Merry Christmas.

900
01:20:30,909 --> 01:20:33,103
- What is it?
- A zebra.

901
01:20:33,203 --> 01:20:37,315
- Merry Christmas!
- Ernst, happy Christmas.

902
01:20:37,415 --> 01:20:39,985
Mother! Merry Christmas!

903
01:20:40,085 --> 01:20:41,653
Fritz! Happy Christmas.

904
01:20:41,753 --> 01:20:43,530
Oh, Christmas tree
Oh, Christmas tree

905
01:20:43,630 --> 01:20:46,324
Thy leaves are so unchanging

906
01:20:46,424 --> 01:20:47,576
A zebra!

907
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:49,244
Oh, Christmas tree
Oh, Christmas tree

908
01:20:49,344 --> 01:20:51,679
Thy leaves are so unchanging

909
01:20:55,839 --> 01:20:57,928
I think I need that razor after you.

910
01:20:58,028 --> 01:20:59,353
Let's see, Ernst.

911
01:21:00,397 --> 01:21:02,424
Yes... Got it!

912
01:21:04,943 --> 01:21:07,721
Well, it's a good thing
you boys have done,

913
01:21:07,821 --> 01:21:09,890
a very good thing.

914
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:12,366
And I'm gonna try and
make sure it's not wasted.

915
01:21:13,118 --> 01:21:14,227
How do you mean, Father?

916
01:21:14,327 --> 01:21:16,938
The pirates know
you took their prisoner.

917
01:21:17,038 --> 01:21:19,524
They also know
you're somewhere on this island.

918
01:21:19,624 --> 01:21:21,417
Do you think they're likely
to forget about that?

919
01:21:22,127 --> 01:21:23,862
Well, they didn't know she was a girl.

920
01:21:23,962 --> 01:21:25,864
They thought she was a cabin boy
on the old captain's ship.

921
01:21:25,964 --> 01:21:28,007
They wouldn't come here after us.
What've we got?

922
01:21:28,842 --> 01:21:30,744
We've got their prisoner here.

923
01:21:30,844 --> 01:21:34,305
Pirates?
If they come here, I'll shoot them.

924
01:21:36,182 --> 01:21:38,475
I'm afraid it'll take more
than a crossbow.

925
01:21:40,395 --> 01:21:43,173
The cannon. We can bring the cannon
back from the ship.

926
01:21:43,273 --> 01:21:45,441
It's useless, Ernst.
It's rusted right over.

927
01:21:46,818 --> 01:21:48,094
It's my fault.
I should've covered it up.

928
01:21:48,194 --> 01:21:51,223
Now let's not waste time
looking backwards.

929
01:21:51,323 --> 01:21:52,891
Thank you, Father.

930
01:21:52,991 --> 01:21:56,019
First thing tomorrow morning,
we'll go out to the ship,

931
01:21:56,119 --> 01:21:59,189
take off everything else
we might possibly need

932
01:21:59,289 --> 01:22:00,440
and then blow her up.

933
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:02,943
You mean with gunpowder?

934
01:22:03,043 --> 01:22:05,127
Well, what for?
They already know it's there.

935
01:22:06,004 --> 01:22:09,741
I'm hoping that with hundreds of islands
and thousands of reefs,

936
01:22:09,841 --> 01:22:12,009
they won't remember
exactly where we are.

937
01:22:12,969 --> 01:22:14,996
Father's right,
we'll have to blow it up.

938
01:22:15,096 --> 01:22:17,624
We're ready to fight,
but not too proud to hide?

939
01:22:20,769 --> 01:22:22,186
Just a sip now.

940
01:22:24,522 --> 01:22:25,898
That's enough.

941
01:22:29,486 --> 01:22:33,390
It must've taken great courage
to pack off and set off for a new colony

942
01:22:33,490 --> 01:22:36,059
and leave your whole world behind you.

943
01:22:36,159 --> 01:22:37,602
With my husband and my three sons,

944
01:22:37,702 --> 01:22:40,272
I wasn't leaving
my entire world behind me.

945
01:22:40,372 --> 01:22:43,108
Well, you couldn't know
what you were getting into.

946
01:22:43,208 --> 01:22:45,902
There might have been
all kinds of hardships.

947
01:22:46,002 --> 01:22:48,754
I mean, think of the things
you might have had to do without.

948
01:22:52,926 --> 01:22:54,468
Take a look.

949
01:23:03,061 --> 01:23:04,129
It's beautiful.

950
01:23:04,229 --> 01:23:06,923
I've always wanted a daughter,

951
01:23:07,023 --> 01:23:10,135
someone I could dress up
and make clothes for.

952
01:23:10,235 --> 01:23:12,277
I just didn't expect her for Christmas.

953
01:23:13,738 --> 01:23:14,764
Thank you.

954
01:23:14,864 --> 01:23:18,476
How about this? We get some trees,
bend them down, make some snares.

955
01:23:18,576 --> 01:23:21,396
The pirates step in the snares,
they trip the mechanism

956
01:23:21,496 --> 01:23:23,231
and whoosh, they're caught.

957
01:23:23,331 --> 01:23:25,165
But how can we defend this place?

958
01:23:26,751 --> 01:23:30,796
I think what we need is a hill
so they have to come up to us.

959
01:23:31,798 --> 01:23:33,867
- I got an idea.
- What is it, Francis?

960
01:23:33,967 --> 01:23:38,330
Well, we could dig some big pits.

961
01:23:38,430 --> 01:23:41,499
And then we could put some lions
and tigers and snakes

962
01:23:41,599 --> 01:23:43,668
and all sorts of animals in there.

963
01:23:43,768 --> 01:23:46,478
Then when the pirates
come along, they fall in.

964
01:23:47,939 --> 01:23:51,635
Well, I don't know whether we could
manage the lions and tigers,

965
01:23:51,735 --> 01:23:54,095
but I think a few pits

966
01:23:54,195 --> 01:23:56,348
might be a very good idea.

967
01:23:56,448 --> 01:23:57,614
Nyaah!

968
01:24:10,128 --> 01:24:12,197
You look very beautiful, my dear.

969
01:24:12,297 --> 01:24:13,964
Come and join the family.

970
01:24:15,467 --> 01:24:17,259
Allow me, Roberta.

971
01:24:22,932 --> 01:24:26,268
Well... May I have the pleasure
of the first dance?

972
01:24:57,509 --> 01:24:58,592
Whee!

973
01:25:15,777 --> 01:25:17,887
There you are. What did I tell you?

974
01:25:17,987 --> 01:25:21,240
Anything we really need,
the island will produce it, even a girl.

975
01:25:21,366 --> 01:25:24,535
A girl? But we have three sons.

976
01:25:39,926 --> 01:25:41,552
Excuse me, Fritz.

977
01:25:44,055 --> 01:25:45,606
Hey!

978
01:25:52,897 --> 01:25:54,398
I'll dance with you, Fritz.

979
01:25:55,191 --> 01:25:57,442
I'll rest a while, if you don't mind.

980
01:26:04,492 --> 01:26:06,311
What's the matter?

981
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:07,911
I was just thinkin'.

982
01:26:09,289 --> 01:26:12,567
We gotta have those lions and tigers...

983
01:26:12,667 --> 01:26:16,253
Or else... Well, that's the whole idea.

984
01:26:17,922 --> 01:26:19,991
Well, I guess
we'll just have to have them then.

985
01:26:20,091 --> 01:26:21,300
Yeah.

986
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:49,562
Since you have a partner,
I'm sure you won't mind.

987
01:26:59,964 --> 01:27:01,366
It might have been simpler

988
01:27:01,466 --> 01:27:04,577
if I'd left the dress
in the bottom of the chest.

989
01:27:04,677 --> 01:27:05,802
Keep playing.

990
01:27:07,096 --> 01:27:08,847
Oh, thank you.

991
01:27:12,143 --> 01:27:15,479
Come on, Francis.
May I have the pleasure?

992
01:27:18,483 --> 01:27:19,733
Yippee!

993
01:27:21,653 --> 01:27:23,070
Yippee!

994
01:27:26,658 --> 01:27:28,575
Yippee!

995
01:27:48,221 --> 01:27:50,874
Something must've
gone wrong with the fuse.

996
01:27:50,974 --> 01:27:52,959
Well, we're not going back to find out.

997
01:27:53,059 --> 01:27:56,045
We'll have to pick up
every scrap of lumber.

998
01:27:56,145 --> 01:27:57,854
We can't leave any evidence.

999
01:27:59,774 --> 01:28:01,275
Must be getting close.

1000
01:28:08,533 --> 01:28:09,783
Kaboom!

1001
01:28:10,535 --> 01:28:13,287
Kaboom! Kaboom!

1002
01:28:15,123 --> 01:28:17,942
I used to dream that somehow

1003
01:28:18,042 --> 01:28:20,085
we'd find a way to make her sail again.

1004
01:28:21,296 --> 01:28:22,921
Now...

1005
01:28:40,273 --> 01:28:42,941
Well, we can be sure of one thing.

1006
01:28:44,110 --> 01:28:46,179
If the pirates do come,

1007
01:28:46,279 --> 01:28:49,031
we're going to be outnumbered
maybe ten to one.

1008
01:28:50,700 --> 01:28:54,479
But up here if we prepare
everything in advance,

1009
01:28:54,579 --> 01:28:57,815
I think we'll be able to give
a very good account of ourselves.

1010
01:28:57,915 --> 01:29:01,084
We'll be just like medieval knights
defending the castle.

1011
01:29:02,128 --> 01:29:07,033
We'll keep the muskets
for our final defense.

1012
01:29:07,133 --> 01:29:09,535
And I'll give the order
when to use them.

1013
01:29:09,635 --> 01:29:12,705
Of course,
if anything should happen to me,

1014
01:29:12,805 --> 01:29:15,974
then Fritz will take charge, then Ernst.

1015
01:29:16,100 --> 01:29:17,934
And then me.

1016
01:29:19,062 --> 01:29:21,297
Yes, then you, Francis.

1017
01:29:21,397 --> 01:29:23,383
We've only got a small army.

1018
01:29:23,483 --> 01:29:25,150
We can only afford one general.

1019
01:29:26,486 --> 01:29:28,429
Now, that's our weak point.

1020
01:29:28,529 --> 01:29:30,598
And this is where
they'll try to come up.

1021
01:29:30,698 --> 01:29:32,350
This is where we could've
used the cannon.

1022
01:29:32,450 --> 01:29:34,686
Well, we'll have to do the best we can
without it.

1023
01:29:34,786 --> 01:29:36,771
Now down there, we'll put our pits

1024
01:29:36,871 --> 01:29:39,790
and then our snares
and our entanglements.

1025
01:29:41,125 --> 01:29:45,613
Maybe we could plant some gunpowder
and touch it off with fuses from the top.

1026
01:29:45,713 --> 01:29:47,740
You know, anything we can think of
to hold them up.

1027
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:50,675
You can rely on me, Roberta.
I've got it all worked out.

1028
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:54,831
And I take care of the lions and tigers
and things.

1029
01:29:54,931 --> 01:29:56,040
Right, Francis.

1030
01:29:56,140 --> 01:29:57,808
- You're in charge of the tigers.
- Oh, good.

1031
01:30:04,816 --> 01:30:07,927
Now the thing about me is that
I'd like to be something in the world.

1032
01:30:08,027 --> 01:30:09,846
That's why I want to go to school.

1033
01:30:09,946 --> 01:30:11,931
You'd love it in London anyway.

1034
01:30:12,031 --> 01:30:15,393
There are concerts, parties, dances,

1035
01:30:15,493 --> 01:30:19,246
ladies in beautiful gowns,
elegant men in tall hats.

1036
01:30:20,790 --> 01:30:22,066
Did you ever own a tall hat?

1037
01:30:23,088 --> 01:30:26,571
- No.
- I can't wait to see you in one.

1038
01:30:26,671 --> 01:30:28,955
You'll be quite handsome.

1039
01:30:31,008 --> 01:30:34,761
I think that's what I miss most of all,
the color and the excitement.

1040
01:30:37,932 --> 01:30:41,351
I know I'd especially like it
if you were there.

1041
01:30:43,688 --> 01:30:45,021
I'll be there.

1042
01:30:46,315 --> 01:30:49,594
As long as I live, I don't think
I shall travel any further from home

1043
01:30:49,694 --> 01:30:51,486
than an occasional trip to the seaside.

1044
01:30:52,780 --> 01:30:54,364
Thank you, Roberta.

1045
01:30:55,867 --> 01:30:59,395
There must be something
my grandfather can do for all of you.

1046
01:30:59,495 --> 01:31:00,772
Herr Kobel used to say,

1047
01:31:00,872 --> 01:31:03,566
"For some boys, school is a punishment,

1048
01:31:03,666 --> 01:31:05,083
"for others, a reward."

1049
01:31:07,044 --> 01:31:09,838
There must be something, though,
my grandfather can do.

1050
01:31:17,555 --> 01:31:19,139
Francis, don't!

1051
01:31:20,475 --> 01:31:23,127
If you drop that,
you could blow us all to pieces.

1052
01:31:23,227 --> 01:31:26,964
Oh, that wouldn't set it off, just to
drop it. You'd have to light the fuse.

1053
01:31:27,064 --> 01:31:29,175
Even then I'm not so sure.

1054
01:31:29,275 --> 01:31:30,802
You don't think they'll work?

1055
01:31:30,902 --> 01:31:33,346
Well, they may make noise,
keep the pirates confused.

1056
01:31:33,446 --> 01:31:34,639
That's about all they're good for.

1057
01:31:34,739 --> 01:31:37,616
Just because Papa thought
of them instead of you!

1058
01:31:39,911 --> 01:31:42,688
Hey, what's all this?
More pirate alarms?

1059
01:31:42,788 --> 01:31:44,857
Yes, for over there on the steep side.

1060
01:31:44,957 --> 01:31:46,917
You and your pirate alarm. Ha!

1061
01:31:50,087 --> 01:31:52,782
What about your tiger?
Have you caught him yet?

1062
01:31:52,882 --> 01:31:55,326
No, because until Fritz
and Ernst dig the pits,

1063
01:31:55,426 --> 01:31:57,245
I don't have any place to keep him.

1064
01:31:57,345 --> 01:31:58,704
Ernst, Roberta!

1065
01:31:58,804 --> 01:32:00,540
One of you give me a hand, will you?

1066
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:03,225
- Oh, it's all right. I'll go.
- Don't bother.

1067
01:32:06,395 --> 01:32:09,356
Up there, pull the knot
as tight as you can.

1068
01:32:11,943 --> 01:32:13,777
Francis, put that down!

1069
01:32:22,537 --> 01:32:23,703
Is that all right?

1070
01:32:26,916 --> 01:32:28,250
Good.

1071
01:32:51,983 --> 01:32:53,468
There we are.

1072
01:32:53,568 --> 01:32:55,360
What are you doing?

1073
01:32:55,486 --> 01:32:57,737
He was just showing me how it will work.

1074
01:33:01,951 --> 01:33:04,770
I feel sorry for any pirates
who come creeping around here.

1075
01:33:04,870 --> 01:33:07,231
Well, it was my idea, don't forget.

1076
01:33:07,331 --> 01:33:09,874
If you'd like,
I'll show you what else I had in mind.

1077
01:33:49,957 --> 01:33:52,068
Pirates. They're here.

1078
01:33:52,168 --> 01:33:54,711
Into the fort, everybody.
Come on, Mother, quick.

1079
01:33:56,505 --> 01:33:59,049
- What is it?
- Francis? Where is he?

1080
01:34:00,426 --> 01:34:02,328
You know those coconut bombs?

1081
01:34:02,428 --> 01:34:05,456
You don't have to worry about them.
They work right well.

1082
01:34:05,556 --> 01:34:06,541
Come down here.

1083
01:34:06,641 --> 01:34:08,334
Don't you know
you might have been killed?

1084
01:34:08,434 --> 01:34:10,711
If you had stayed
where you were supposed to, Ernst,

1085
01:34:10,811 --> 01:34:12,046
this wouldn't have happened.

1086
01:34:12,146 --> 01:34:13,673
You can't tell me
what I'm supposed to do.

1087
01:34:13,773 --> 01:34:16,509
- I just did.
- That's enough.

1088
01:34:16,609 --> 01:34:17,802
I don't care.

1089
01:34:17,902 --> 01:34:20,388
He thinks he can just give orders
and get anyone to slave for him.

1090
01:34:20,488 --> 01:34:22,697
Ernst, I said that's enough!

1091
01:34:24,075 --> 01:34:27,118
This incident's closed.
Now let's get back to work.

1092
01:34:30,414 --> 01:34:32,749
And I don't want to hear
another word about it.

1093
01:34:47,473 --> 01:34:51,502
If you really don't want to go to school,
and your mind is made up,

1094
01:34:51,602 --> 01:34:54,714
maybe my grandfather
could give you a job.

1095
01:34:54,814 --> 01:34:57,049
It'll be a good job, Fritz,

1096
01:34:57,149 --> 01:34:59,510
perhaps in the counting house.

1097
01:34:59,610 --> 01:35:03,222
What if he doesn't get back here
for one reason or another?

1098
01:35:03,322 --> 01:35:06,851
What if we have to stay on this island
for 10 or 20 years?

1099
01:35:06,951 --> 01:35:09,312
He will come back, I know it.

1100
01:35:09,412 --> 01:35:11,564
He's probably out there now

1101
01:35:11,664 --> 01:35:14,207
headed this way
in one of his fastest ships.

1102
01:35:17,294 --> 01:35:19,754
You'll take the job if he offered it
to you, wouldn't you?

1103
01:35:22,216 --> 01:35:24,201
It's not that I wouldn't appreciate it,

1104
01:35:24,301 --> 01:35:26,287
but it's just not for me,

1105
01:35:26,387 --> 01:35:29,540
cooped in an office
counting somebody else's money,

1106
01:35:29,640 --> 01:35:31,500
doing the same thing day after day.

1107
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:33,268
What would you like to do?

1108
01:35:35,187 --> 01:35:36,922
Well, if we get off this island,

1109
01:35:37,022 --> 01:35:39,008
I'd like to do
what we started out to do,

1110
01:35:39,108 --> 01:35:41,776
go on to New Guinea
and become part of the new colony.

1111
01:35:43,070 --> 01:35:45,029
Maybe take up some land in my own name.

1112
01:35:47,324 --> 01:35:48,616
Why?

1113
01:35:49,702 --> 01:35:51,035
Why?

1114
01:35:52,538 --> 01:35:55,066
Well, because it's a good thing.

1115
01:35:55,166 --> 01:35:58,110
You've got a chance to build
with your own two hands.

1116
01:35:58,210 --> 01:36:00,128
It's the beginning of a new country.

1117
01:36:01,255 --> 01:36:02,756
That's what I like about it.

1118
01:36:04,925 --> 01:36:06,342
Well, I'm going to London.

1119
01:36:08,971 --> 01:36:10,764
Ernst was very flattering.

1120
01:36:11,891 --> 01:36:13,975
He said he'd like to be there if I was.

1121
01:36:17,438 --> 01:36:19,647
Well, wouldn't you like
to see me in London?

1122
01:36:22,067 --> 01:36:24,486
I don't know
that I'll ever be in London.

1123
01:36:35,039 --> 01:36:37,665
I don't see how anybody
can shoot a thing like this.

1124
01:36:41,378 --> 01:36:44,547
Fritz, why don't you teach me
how to shoot?

1125
01:36:46,967 --> 01:36:49,469
It might be important
if there's a battle.

1126
01:36:51,388 --> 01:36:53,097
All right. Come on.

1127
01:36:57,186 --> 01:36:59,630
Well, first,

1128
01:36:59,730 --> 01:37:02,550
you pull the gun
tight into your shoulder, like this.

1129
01:37:02,650 --> 01:37:04,400
And...

1130
01:37:06,237 --> 01:37:10,307
Well, here. Tight into your shoulder.

1131
01:37:10,407 --> 01:37:12,810
And,

1132
01:37:12,910 --> 01:37:14,478
well, right hand near the trigger.

1133
01:37:14,578 --> 01:37:16,355
No, no. Here.

1134
01:37:16,455 --> 01:37:19,984
Left hand out to support it.
A little more. Right.

1135
01:37:20,084 --> 01:37:24,572
No. No, no.
You have to use this hand to support it.

1136
01:37:25,672 --> 01:37:28,633
Now you sight along the barrel here.

1137
01:37:29,552 --> 01:37:30,828
I hope you don't mind.

1138
01:37:30,928 --> 01:37:33,429
Why do you think
I wanted you to teach me?

1139
01:37:43,524 --> 01:37:46,594
Roberta, where are you?

1140
01:37:46,694 --> 01:37:48,194
I'm over here.

1141
01:37:50,781 --> 01:37:52,615
May I have this next dance, milady?

1142
01:37:56,078 --> 01:37:58,189
You said that's what
you missed most of all.

1143
01:37:58,289 --> 01:38:00,524
I thought maybe I could
make you feel at home.

1144
01:38:00,624 --> 01:38:01,859
Wherever did you get that, Ernst?

1145
01:38:01,959 --> 01:38:04,195
You wish the name of my tailor,
my good man?

1146
01:38:04,295 --> 01:38:06,697
Go two blocks past the town square,
take the first street to the left.

1147
01:38:08,424 --> 01:38:10,868
I thought you were supposed
to be covering the pits.

1148
01:38:10,968 --> 01:38:14,246
Yes. And I thought you were supposed
to be working on the bridge.

1149
01:38:14,346 --> 01:38:17,307
He was teaching me how to shoot.
I asked him to.

1150
01:38:17,433 --> 01:38:18,474
Fritz?

1151
01:38:20,144 --> 01:38:22,604
Come here a minute.
I wanna show you something.

1152
01:38:27,151 --> 01:38:31,347
If you'd like to learn how to shoot,
Roberta, I'd be happy to teach you.

1153
01:38:31,447 --> 01:38:33,406
I think I have the general idea.

1154
01:38:44,793 --> 01:38:47,571
You know, Fritz, the ol' tiger,

1155
01:38:47,671 --> 01:38:51,667
he'll come along here like this at night
after the pit's been all covered up.

1156
01:38:51,767 --> 01:38:55,079
And he'll sniff the meat,

1157
01:38:55,179 --> 01:38:57,122
and he'll start to circle the pit.

1158
01:39:01,977 --> 01:39:04,797
And he'll come around here like this.

1159
01:39:05,707 --> 01:39:07,424
And he'll think,

1160
01:39:07,524 --> 01:39:10,970
"I think I just might grab
that big hunk of meat."

1161
01:39:11,070 --> 01:39:13,430
So he gets down like this...

1162
01:39:13,530 --> 01:39:17,033
And he gets like this and then...

1163
01:39:19,119 --> 01:39:21,605
I think you better just tell me, Francis,
not show me.

1164
01:39:21,705 --> 01:39:24,441
Otherwise you'll be in there
before that tiger of yours.

1165
01:39:24,541 --> 01:39:27,278
Well, anyhow, he'll jump for the bait...

1166
01:39:27,378 --> 01:39:30,531
- And that's how I'll catch my tiger.
- Ha!

1167
01:39:30,631 --> 01:39:33,617
Do you honestly think a tiger's
going to fall for something like this?

1168
01:39:33,717 --> 01:39:35,551
You're wasting your time.

1169
01:39:37,846 --> 01:39:40,124
You talk about wasting time, Ernst.

1170
01:39:40,224 --> 01:39:43,294
How many hours did you spend
making that silly hat?

1171
01:39:43,394 --> 01:39:45,546
That's none of your business.
You're not my boss.

1172
01:39:45,646 --> 01:39:49,091
No. Now look, Ernst, we've got more
important things to do

1173
01:39:49,191 --> 01:39:50,926
than try to amuse Roberta.

1174
01:39:51,026 --> 01:39:52,428
The trouble with you is you're jealous.

1175
01:39:52,528 --> 01:39:56,656
Jealous? Of what?
Why don't you grow up?

1176
01:40:00,786 --> 01:40:02,328
That's enough, Ernst.

1177
01:40:11,380 --> 01:40:14,450
Fight, fight! Now you hit him, Fritz!

1178
01:40:17,469 --> 01:40:19,079
Come on, Fritz, get him!

1179
01:40:19,179 --> 01:40:20,289
Get him, Fritz!

1180
01:40:20,389 --> 01:40:21,764
Fight, fight!

1181
01:40:24,893 --> 01:40:26,837
Come on, Ernst, you can get him!

1182
01:40:26,937 --> 01:40:30,106
Fight, fight! Get him, Ernst! Come on!

1183
01:40:30,232 --> 01:40:32,275
Get him, Ernst, get him!

1184
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:34,861
Oh, what a beauty!

1185
01:40:36,071 --> 01:40:37,181
Now your turn, Fritz.

1186
01:40:37,281 --> 01:40:39,407
Come on, Fritz, get him. Your turn.

1187
01:40:43,120 --> 01:40:44,120
Come on.

1188
01:40:44,705 --> 01:40:46,065
Fight, fight!

1189
01:40:46,165 --> 01:40:49,042
Are you afraid of him, Ernst?
Poke him one!

1190
01:40:50,335 --> 01:40:51,862
Come on, Fritz.
Get him, Ernst. Come on!

1191
01:40:51,962 --> 01:40:53,546
Fritz! Ernst!

1192
01:40:55,132 --> 01:40:56,299
What's this all about?

1193
01:40:58,802 --> 01:40:59,802
Nothing.

1194
01:41:02,473 --> 01:41:03,973
Who started it?

1195
01:41:15,819 --> 01:41:17,930
You know...

1196
01:41:18,030 --> 01:41:21,141
I think this is probably my fault.

1197
01:41:21,241 --> 01:41:23,868
I think I've been pushing everybody
just a bit too hard.

1198
01:41:25,204 --> 01:41:27,497
It might do us a lot of good
to relax for a change.

1199
01:41:28,373 --> 01:41:29,999
So here's what we're gonna do.

1200
01:41:31,085 --> 01:41:34,071
Tomorrow we are going to observe...

1201
01:41:34,171 --> 01:41:37,507
The first national holiday
in the history of New Switzerland.

1202
01:41:38,842 --> 01:41:40,786
A holiday?

1203
01:41:40,886 --> 01:41:43,414
You mean like Christmas?

1204
01:41:43,514 --> 01:41:46,583
Now let's get on with the work.
Get ready for it?

1205
01:41:46,683 --> 01:41:47,793
Yippee!

1206
01:41:47,893 --> 01:41:51,813
A holiday!
We're gonna have a holiday, Roberta!

1207
01:42:09,039 --> 01:42:10,774
Where did we get these flags?

1208
01:42:10,874 --> 01:42:13,084
I got 'em off the ship.

1209
01:42:16,797 --> 01:42:18,615
Allow me.

1210
01:42:18,715 --> 01:42:20,550
Thank you.

1211
01:42:44,032 --> 01:42:47,394
How do you like this
for the winner of the race?

1212
01:42:47,494 --> 01:42:49,453
I better try it on for size?

1213
01:42:51,331 --> 01:42:54,584
Not going to argue?
Just conceding that I'll win?

1214
01:42:56,587 --> 01:42:58,739
Fritz, about this afternoon...

1215
01:42:58,839 --> 01:43:01,575
I know why you and Ernst were fighting.
It was my fault and I'm sorry.

1216
01:43:01,675 --> 01:43:03,285
It wasn't your fault, Roberta.

1217
01:43:03,385 --> 01:43:04,703
Everything that's happened here lately

1218
01:43:04,803 --> 01:43:06,580
is because you brought me
back with you,

1219
01:43:06,680 --> 01:43:09,333
even the danger we're in
from the pirates.

1220
01:43:09,433 --> 01:43:12,086
I don't recall your asking
to be brought back here.

1221
01:43:12,186 --> 01:43:13,462
As a matter of fact, it seems to me

1222
01:43:13,562 --> 01:43:16,022
you had quite different ideas,
remember?

1223
01:43:18,317 --> 01:43:20,219
Poor Ernst.

1224
01:43:20,319 --> 01:43:23,321
The hours he must have spent
making that silly hat.

1225
01:43:24,656 --> 01:43:26,517
He didn't mean to neglect his work.

1226
01:43:26,617 --> 01:43:28,784
He was just trying to be nice to me,
that's all.

1227
01:43:29,828 --> 01:43:31,647
I know that.

1228
01:43:31,747 --> 01:43:33,372
I never dreamed he'd do that.

1229
01:43:34,666 --> 01:43:36,735
I did hope I could repay your family
in some way.

1230
01:43:36,835 --> 01:43:39,113
And all I've achieved so far
is to cause trouble between you.

1231
01:43:39,213 --> 01:43:41,198
I didn't want to do that.

1232
01:43:41,298 --> 01:43:42,632
Don't.

1233
01:43:44,509 --> 01:43:48,539
Roberta... I'm not much at saying
things, you know, but...

1234
01:43:48,639 --> 01:43:49,680
It's no good.

1235
01:43:50,474 --> 01:43:51,682
Fritz, when we leave here,

1236
01:43:52,517 --> 01:43:55,311
you're going on
and I have to go back to London.

1237
01:43:56,313 --> 01:43:57,855
Let's not make it difficult.

1238
01:44:00,317 --> 01:44:02,094
Well, you talk about when we leave here.

1239
01:44:02,194 --> 01:44:04,221
How do you know
we're ever going to leave?

1240
01:44:04,321 --> 01:44:05,696
We might be here...

1241
01:44:10,535 --> 01:44:13,188
My tiger! I bet I got him!

1242
01:44:13,288 --> 01:44:15,816
Francis, come back here! Francis!

1243
01:44:16,693 --> 01:44:18,414
Come on.

1244
01:44:18,710 --> 01:44:20,211
Look out, Ernst. Look out.

1245
01:44:24,883 --> 01:44:26,076
He might be anywhere.

1246
01:44:26,176 --> 01:44:27,202
Let me go.

1247
01:44:27,302 --> 01:44:29,413
Francis, wait till we get there.
Wait a minute.

1248
01:44:29,513 --> 01:44:32,473
- Francis, wait!
- It's my tiger. Let me go!

1249
01:44:34,434 --> 01:44:36,545
Mind the pit.

1250
01:44:36,645 --> 01:44:37,728
Where is he?

1251
01:44:48,365 --> 01:44:51,643
Well, I never believed it!
Well done, Francis.

1252
01:44:51,743 --> 01:44:55,439
Let's hurry and cover it up
with palm leaves

1253
01:44:55,539 --> 01:44:58,901
so he'll go to sleep
and the pirates won't know he's there.

1254
01:44:59,001 --> 01:45:00,068
No, you better run off
and tell your mother.

1255
01:45:00,168 --> 01:45:01,210
We'll cover up the pit.

1256
01:45:02,379 --> 01:45:03,713
Oh, yes.

1257
01:45:05,048 --> 01:45:09,051
You don't have to worry anymore.
I got my tiger.

1258
01:45:10,721 --> 01:45:12,305
He's got his tiger.

1259
01:45:32,784 --> 01:45:35,646
Everybody back behind the starting mark.

1260
01:45:35,746 --> 01:45:37,147
Everybody out of my way!

1261
01:45:37,247 --> 01:45:38,372
Stay back.

1262
01:45:39,082 --> 01:45:41,959
Come on! Come on, Rocky, turn around.

1263
01:45:42,085 --> 01:45:43,586
Hang on. Hang on.

1264
01:45:45,505 --> 01:45:48,257
Mother, you hold Duke, will you?

1265
01:45:49,426 --> 01:45:51,787
Now remember,
you go around the first pylon

1266
01:45:51,887 --> 01:45:53,038
and then over to that one,

1267
01:45:53,138 --> 01:45:56,750
then back and forth three times
and here to the finish.

1268
01:45:56,850 --> 01:45:59,086
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
to the winner...

1269
01:45:59,186 --> 01:46:00,170
Good.

1270
01:46:00,270 --> 01:46:03,048
This gorgeous culinary creation,
which all of us will eat.

1271
01:46:03,148 --> 01:46:04,174
Bravo!

1272
01:46:04,274 --> 01:46:08,720
Quiet. And serving as our official starter,
the loveliest lady of the canton.

1273
01:46:08,820 --> 01:46:11,530
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Wait!

1274
01:46:12,324 --> 01:46:14,226
- Quick, Mother, fire.
- Wait for me.

1275
01:46:19,581 --> 01:46:22,166
- Come on!
- We're winning!

1276
01:46:24,336 --> 01:46:25,336
Faster!

1277
01:46:30,300 --> 01:46:32,202
Come on! Come on, Rocky. Get goin'!

1278
01:46:32,302 --> 01:46:34,261
Come on, Duchess. Round you go!

1279
01:46:37,265 --> 01:46:39,418
- Wait!
- That way. Come on, Rocky!

1280
01:46:40,158 --> 01:46:43,062
Let me get on. Give me a chance.

1281
01:46:44,731 --> 01:46:45,966
Now we're off.

1282
01:46:46,066 --> 01:46:49,052
No, Turk, get out of here.
You're ruining everything!

1283
01:46:49,152 --> 01:46:51,529
Get out. No, Turk, the other way!

1284
01:46:52,489 --> 01:46:55,533
Look out! Look out!
Wait a minute, Ernst.

1285
01:46:57,244 --> 01:47:00,272
Oh. Oh. Oh, no, not that way.

1286
01:47:00,372 --> 01:47:02,691
Hold it, Clementine. Hold it.
What's the matter with you?

1287
01:47:02,791 --> 01:47:04,166
Try to jump on.

1288
01:47:05,544 --> 01:47:08,003
Come on, boy! Go. Good boy, Lightning!

1289
01:47:08,839 --> 01:47:10,407
Hey!

1290
01:47:11,800 --> 01:47:13,910
You're going the wrong way, Roberta.

1291
01:47:14,010 --> 01:47:15,177
Come on, Rocky!

1292
01:47:17,139 --> 01:47:18,389
Stand still!

1293
01:47:25,439 --> 01:47:27,148
Come on.

1294
01:47:29,693 --> 01:47:31,417
Now we're gonna win!

1295
01:47:33,196 --> 01:47:36,892
It's not good
if you can't stay on him, Fritz.

1296
01:47:41,590 --> 01:47:43,956
Turk! Get away, Turk!

1297
01:47:45,625 --> 01:47:49,212
No fair, Ernst. You have to ride him.
Come on, Rocky. We're gonna win.

1298
01:47:49,312 --> 01:47:51,365
Come on, Lightning.

1299
01:47:52,549 --> 01:47:55,551
Straight, Clementine.
Oh, no, not that way. The other way.

1300
01:47:55,677 --> 01:47:57,094
No, the other way!

1301
01:47:58,430 --> 01:48:03,001
Come on! Get away! Now.

1302
01:48:03,101 --> 01:48:04,503
Come on!

1303
01:48:04,603 --> 01:48:06,588
Turk, get out of here.

1304
01:48:06,688 --> 01:48:07,923
Run, run, run!

1305
01:48:08,023 --> 01:48:11,525
Oh, I give up. Come on, Clementine.

1306
01:48:13,403 --> 01:48:14,862
Whoa! Whoa!

1307
01:48:17,428 --> 01:48:19,267
Come on! Don't just walk!

1308
01:48:25,081 --> 01:48:27,416
- Out of my way!
- Keep out of the way, Clementine.

1309
01:48:28,460 --> 01:48:29,528
Come on.

1310
01:48:29,628 --> 01:48:33,448
I'm gonna ride you
if it's the last thing I do.

1311
01:48:35,175 --> 01:48:37,077
Quick, the tape! The tape.

1312
01:48:37,177 --> 01:48:38,636
Quick!

1313
01:48:41,556 --> 01:48:45,001
Turk, mind now. That's not the way
you're supposed to go.

1314
01:48:45,101 --> 01:48:48,187
Wrong way, Roberta. Come back.

1315
01:48:49,105 --> 01:48:51,815
Roberta, come back here!

1316
01:49:24,057 --> 01:49:26,209
Come on, Clementine.

1317
01:49:26,309 --> 01:49:27,878
Wrong side.

1318
01:49:27,978 --> 01:49:29,754
Hurry, Rocky. Come on, Rocky.

1319
01:49:29,854 --> 01:49:32,716
Come on, Rocky, we're winning. Come on.

1320
01:49:32,816 --> 01:49:36,011
- Francis, come on!
- No fair, Roberta. I was winning.

1321
01:49:36,111 --> 01:49:37,486
You're not hurt?

1322
01:49:38,989 --> 01:49:40,474
- Pirates on the beach.
- What?

1323
01:49:41,783 --> 01:49:43,810
There's pirates right here on our beach.

1324
01:49:43,910 --> 01:49:46,396
- Up the hill, everybody. Quick.
- I'll get the muskets.

1325
01:49:46,496 --> 01:49:49,331
Come on, quick, quick.
Come on, Roberta. Come on.

1326
01:49:50,667 --> 01:49:51,902
- Remember your orders?
- Yes, sir.

1327
01:49:52,002 --> 01:49:53,669
- Well, get started.
- Yes, sir.

1328
01:50:20,238 --> 01:50:23,407
Come on. Come on, Francis.

1329
01:50:25,785 --> 01:50:27,870
Duke, Turk, come back!

1330
01:50:29,539 --> 01:50:31,457
No time now. They'll be all right.

1331
01:50:34,753 --> 01:50:36,378
Come along, Mother.

1332
01:50:38,214 --> 01:50:39,882
Come on, Francis.

1333
01:50:44,429 --> 01:50:46,665
You just stay quiet.

1334
01:50:47,365 --> 01:50:49,399
Quick, quick.

1335
01:51:02,906 --> 01:51:04,073
Francis!

1336
01:51:10,246 --> 01:51:11,481
They see us.

1337
01:51:13,583 --> 01:51:16,585
They've seen us.
Fritz, Ernst, the bridge, quick!

1338
01:51:18,421 --> 01:51:19,672
All right, Mother?

1339
01:51:27,097 --> 01:51:28,806
Here, Duke. Here, Turk.

1340
01:51:33,186 --> 01:51:34,645
Good boy. Good boy.

1341
01:51:40,193 --> 01:51:41,735
- Ready, Ernst?
- Ready.

1342
01:51:53,998 --> 01:51:55,040
Now!

1343
01:52:07,637 --> 01:52:09,138
Fritz, Ernst, come up.

1344
01:52:17,814 --> 01:52:18,981
Come up, Fritz.

1345
01:52:46,634 --> 01:52:48,745
They must be getting near it now.

1346
01:52:48,845 --> 01:52:50,179
Over this way a bit.

1347
01:53:00,857 --> 01:53:02,634
My tiger. He got 'em!

1348
01:53:34,974 --> 01:53:36,292
Number three.

1349
01:53:36,392 --> 01:53:38,060
Don't light it till I tell you.

1350
01:53:42,482 --> 01:53:43,774
Now!

1351
01:53:46,903 --> 01:53:48,805
The idea, my boy, is to judge it

1352
01:53:48,905 --> 01:53:52,157
so that the flame reaches the powder
at the same time as the pirates.

1353
01:53:56,329 --> 01:53:58,622
See what I mean? Give me the torch.

1354
01:54:03,670 --> 01:54:04,753
Bull's-eye!

1355
01:54:28,444 --> 01:54:31,029
Look at 'em running!

1356
01:54:36,536 --> 01:54:39,037
- Now the coconut bombs.
- No, no, no. Not yet. Not yet.

1357
01:54:43,793 --> 01:54:46,044
- They're coming around this way.
- Don't fire yet.

1358
01:54:47,964 --> 01:54:49,214
Get back. Get back.

1359
01:55:02,145 --> 01:55:03,645
We've got 'em on the run!

1360
01:55:17,327 --> 01:55:18,853
Right. The coconut bombs.

1361
01:55:18,953 --> 01:55:20,495
Oh, good!

1362
01:55:30,506 --> 01:55:31,965
Nah.

1363
01:55:33,176 --> 01:55:34,343
Kaboom!

1364
01:55:36,137 --> 01:55:37,763
That's it.

1365
01:55:58,284 --> 01:55:59,826
- Keep throwing.
- We did it!

1366
01:56:06,876 --> 01:56:08,251
We haven't stopped them.

1367
01:56:10,129 --> 01:56:12,448
Use the rifles.
Try and pick off the leaders.

1368
01:56:12,548 --> 01:56:14,925
Where you going, Father?

1369
01:56:25,478 --> 01:56:28,256
- Hurray!
- It worked!

1370
01:56:28,356 --> 01:56:30,524
Watch those logs mow 'em down.

1371
01:56:32,568 --> 01:56:33,803
Look at 'em!

1372
01:56:33,903 --> 01:56:36,279
Hurray! There's a man getting squashed.

1373
01:57:02,849 --> 01:57:06,044
- We're saved! We're saved!
- Yippee! Hurray!

1374
01:57:06,144 --> 01:57:07,629
Hurray!

1375
01:57:43,723 --> 01:57:46,767
Kuala make talk.

1376
01:57:48,394 --> 01:57:50,145
You hear?

1377
01:57:51,522 --> 01:57:52,647
We hear you.

1378
01:57:53,608 --> 01:57:57,387
You take boy belong Kuala.

1379
01:57:57,487 --> 01:58:01,808
Give us boy. No more fight.

1380
01:58:01,908 --> 01:58:03,533
You hear?

1381
01:58:04,827 --> 01:58:07,647
You want the boy, you come and get him.

1382
01:58:07,747 --> 01:58:10,817
We're ready for you.
And you can put away your white flag.

1383
01:58:10,917 --> 01:58:12,986
Maybe it would be better to agree.

1384
01:58:13,086 --> 01:58:17,031
Don't worry. He wouldn't bargain with us
if he thought he could beat us.

1385
01:58:17,131 --> 01:58:21,536
Send the boy down the hill.

1386
01:58:21,636 --> 01:58:23,246
Kuala take boy.

1387
01:58:23,346 --> 01:58:25,764
Get plenty money.

1388
01:58:26,933 --> 01:58:30,852
Nobody hurt. You hear?

1389
01:58:33,439 --> 01:58:37,010
You make Kuala fight long time!

1390
01:58:37,110 --> 01:58:40,362
Then you die...

1391
01:58:41,906 --> 01:58:45,617
And Kuala take boy all the same.

1392
01:58:48,538 --> 01:58:52,984
It's true. You can't possibly
hold them off forever.

1393
01:58:53,084 --> 01:58:55,153
You don't look like
a boy anymore, Roberta.

1394
01:58:55,253 --> 01:58:57,780
You know what will happen
if you give yourself up now?

1395
01:58:57,880 --> 01:59:00,616
Do you know what might happen
to all of you if I don't?

1396
01:59:00,716 --> 01:59:02,785
Nothing's going to happen to anybody.

1397
01:59:02,885 --> 01:59:06,789
He must think we're mad.
Roberta, don't listen to such nonsense.

1398
01:59:08,110 --> 01:59:09,667
My pirate alarm!

1399
01:59:09,767 --> 01:59:13,645
My pirate alarm!
They're comin' up that way!

1400
01:59:28,828 --> 01:59:31,746
- Quick!
- Down! Down!

1401
01:59:44,010 --> 01:59:46,469
- Look out, Ernst!
- Father, look out!

1402
01:59:58,357 --> 01:59:59,649
Ernst, look!

1403
02:00:07,408 --> 02:00:09,784
Roberta, stay back.

1404
02:00:55,414 --> 02:00:56,498
Get down, Roberta!

1405
02:01:06,968 --> 02:01:09,203
- How many rounds have we got left?
- Five.

1406
02:01:09,303 --> 02:01:10,303
Five.

1407
02:01:17,853 --> 02:01:19,187
Not getting very close.

1408
02:01:28,289 --> 02:01:30,548
They're running away.

1409
02:01:32,076 --> 02:01:34,075
They're running away!

1410
02:01:51,887 --> 02:01:53,789
It's a ship, a merchantman!

1411
02:01:53,889 --> 02:01:55,416
They're firing on the pirates!

1412
02:01:55,516 --> 02:01:57,934
It looks like
one of my grandfather's ships.

1413
02:02:03,566 --> 02:02:05,108
I knew he'd come for us.

1414
02:02:11,365 --> 02:02:13,643
Yippee! Here we are, up here!

1415
02:02:19,457 --> 02:02:21,234
Can I see your hat, please?

1416
02:02:21,334 --> 02:02:23,835
- This? Of course, my boy.
- Thank you.

1417
02:02:28,382 --> 02:02:30,660
No, no more, thank you, no.
That was delicious.

1418
02:02:30,760 --> 02:02:32,411
Well, there's nothing to it, my boy.

1419
02:02:32,511 --> 02:02:35,305
I've been making donations
to that college for years.

1420
02:02:35,431 --> 02:02:37,182
About time I asked for something.

1421
02:02:38,351 --> 02:02:40,393
Well, Roberta and I
have talked about school,

1422
02:02:41,437 --> 02:02:43,923
but a university... I never dreamed!

1423
02:02:44,023 --> 02:02:45,940
I'm going to a university!

1424
02:02:47,234 --> 02:02:50,137
And as for the rest of you,
I won't try to influence you.

1425
02:02:50,237 --> 02:02:52,181
But if you'd like to return to Europe,

1426
02:02:52,281 --> 02:02:55,434
well, I think I could make things
interesting for you

1427
02:02:55,534 --> 02:02:56,769
and give you a fresh start.

1428
02:02:56,869 --> 02:02:59,355
But if you still want to go on
to New Guinea,

1429
02:02:59,455 --> 02:03:00,622
I'll be happy to take you there.

1430
02:03:05,795 --> 02:03:09,255
I think that since
we have to decide forever,

1431
02:03:10,800 --> 02:03:14,469
that my husband and I would...
Rather stay here.

1432
02:03:20,643 --> 02:03:22,420
Are you sure that's what you want?

1433
02:03:25,123 --> 02:03:27,850
It's been a good life for us here.

1434
02:03:27,950 --> 02:03:29,218
Of course, as Roberta says,

1435
02:03:29,318 --> 02:03:31,387
there are some few things
you have to do without.

1436
02:03:31,487 --> 02:03:33,347
But it's surprising
how unimportant they seem

1437
02:03:33,447 --> 02:03:35,975
when you don't have people
stopping by feeling sorry for you.

1438
02:03:36,075 --> 02:03:38,894
You mean I don't have to go?

1439
02:03:38,994 --> 02:03:42,857
- Yippee!
- Fritz and Ernst will go with you.

1440
02:03:42,957 --> 02:03:45,834
I think we should keep Francis here
for a few years.

1441
02:03:47,503 --> 02:03:48,837
I'll be back.

1442
02:03:49,713 --> 02:03:52,116
Of course you won't be
without neighbors, you realize.

1443
02:03:52,216 --> 02:03:55,244
This is a new island.
There'll be a new colony,

1444
02:03:55,344 --> 02:03:56,662
a new governor.

1445
02:03:56,762 --> 02:03:58,847
They might make you governor, Father!

1446
02:04:00,182 --> 02:04:02,517
More than likely, I should say.

1447
02:04:16,991 --> 02:04:18,658
- Hello.
- Oh.

1448
02:04:24,248 --> 02:04:25,316
It's funny, isn't it,

1449
02:04:25,416 --> 02:04:28,444
how you can change your mind
about what's important.

1450
02:04:28,544 --> 02:04:30,044
What it is you really want.

1451
02:04:31,797 --> 02:04:33,866
Take your parents.

1452
02:04:33,966 --> 02:04:36,926
All of this time they've been wanting
to get to New Guinea.

1453
02:04:37,887 --> 02:04:39,413
And now when they really
have their chance,

1454
02:04:39,513 --> 02:04:41,457
they find out everything they want
is right here.

1455
02:04:41,557 --> 02:04:43,266
You mean they're not going?

1456
02:04:45,060 --> 02:04:46,853
I can understand how they feel.

1457
02:04:48,147 --> 02:04:49,606
I do too.

1458
02:04:52,860 --> 02:04:54,944
Two people, if they have each other...

1459
02:04:56,405 --> 02:04:58,156
What more could they want?

1460
02:05:02,953 --> 02:05:04,871
I guess... Just to be alone.

1461
02:05:21,931 --> 02:05:23,097
Fritz? Roberta?

1462
02:05:23,933 --> 02:05:25,167
It's time to go now.

1463
02:05:25,267 --> 02:05:28,102
- The captain wants to sail with the tide.
- Just coming.

1464
02:05:35,653 --> 02:05:38,347
Well, surely you'll want to go
and see him off.

1465
02:05:38,447 --> 02:05:40,865
Anyway, I'll have to
explain to my grandfather.

1466
02:05:47,581 --> 02:05:49,859
- Bye, Ernst.
- Bye, Ernst.

1467
02:05:49,959 --> 02:05:51,986
Come back next year. Good-bye!

1468
02:05:52,086 --> 02:05:55,239
Good-bye, Mother. Good-bye, Father.
Good-bye, Fritz. Good-bye, Roberta.

1469
02:05:55,339 --> 02:05:57,924
- Good-bye, everybody.
- Good-bye, Ernst.

1470
02:06:00,302 --> 02:06:01,579
God be with you.

1471
02:06:01,679 --> 02:06:05,207
Hey, wait for me. Duchess, Clementine!

1472
02:06:05,307 --> 02:06:06,825
Turk!

1473
02:06:08,727 --> 02:06:10,270
Duke, wait for me!
