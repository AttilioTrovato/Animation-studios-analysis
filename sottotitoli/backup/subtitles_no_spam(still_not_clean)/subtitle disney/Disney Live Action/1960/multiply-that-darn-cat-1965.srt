1
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:54,772
While the city sleeps

2
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:56,975
Every night he creeps

3
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:00,383
Just surveyin' his domain

4
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:05,680
He roams around
like he owns the town

5
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:09,159
He's the king
He makes that plain

6
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:14,963
He knows every trick
Doesn't miss a lick

7
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:18,197
When it comes to keepin' fat

8
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:23,765
Some city slicker
No one is quicker

9
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:25,868
Than

10
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:27,708
That darn cat

11
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,918
Every nook and cranny

12
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:43,292
And garbage can he inspects

13
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,923
So thoroughly

14
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,593
When he's on his rounds

15
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,795
Nothin's out of bounds

16
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:54,306
To his curiosity

17
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,803
He can smile and purr

18
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:00,072
At a pretty her

19
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:02,876
Till she don't know
where she's at

20
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:06,949
Nose like a Geiger

21
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,456
Oh, what a tiger is

22
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:13,048
That darn cat

23
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:15,993
He's a sly old codger

24
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:18,155
An artful dodger

25
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:21,496
A scrounger unsurpassed

26
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:24,963
A ball of fire

27
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,131
A nine-live wire

28
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:31,041
Who just can't be outclassed

29
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,635
Yeah, this midnight rover

30
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,647
He lives in clover

31
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:39,310
It's an art he's got down pat

32
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,913
Never was a greater

33
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:46,152
Smooth operator than that

34
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:52,254
Darn

35
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:56,629
That darn cat

36
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:02,907
That darn cat

37
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:06,377
That darn cat

38
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,879
That darn cat

39
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:16,920
That darn cat

40
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:54,093
Hey, what do you say, fella?

41
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,788
Hey, you're taking my food, huh?

42
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:34,656
Iggy.

43
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,931
- What kept you?
- The lousy buses.

44
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:44,340
- Where'd you leave the car?
- Outside of Fresno, Route 99.

45
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,344
All right. Okay. They found it.

46
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:49,040
- The scan came in on the radio.
- What'd I tell you?

47
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:52,278
The fuzz'll fall for the whole deal,
hook, line and sinker.

48
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:55,014
Maybe. We've got
the federal fuzz on us this time.

49
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:57,454
So what? Who cares?

50
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:00,856
Wait till they pick up them hot 20s
I've been dropping off

51
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:04,021
all the way up the valley.
They're gonna lose their minds.

52
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:06,122
Look at us,
livin' in this solid pad,

53
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,327
a block and a half away
from where we pulled the job.

54
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:11,802
What about them headlines?
We're big news.

55
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,771
Front page,
every one of them...

56
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,434
- Shut up, will you?
- Shut up? Sure.

57
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:19,876
"Two bank robbers
stage daring, daylight holdup."

58
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:23,245
Hey, how about that, huh?
"Daring... daring."

59
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:25,580
"Two armed men
wearing Halloween masks

60
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:28,051
robbed the North Valley bank
early today...

61
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:30,248
- I gotta look.
...seizing a teller,

62
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:32,951
Miss Margaret Miller,
to shield their getaway."

63
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:37,293
Wow. Does this turn you on, huh?

64
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:41,593
Two hundred and fifty
thousand dollars.

65
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:45,533
- Iggy.
- Wow.

66
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:50,133
Iggy, we don't get 250,000
like the papers say.

67
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:53,042
We get 160 grand.

68
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:56,475
A hundred and six...

69
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:01,148
- Are you tryin' to snow me?
- Get your hands off me, meatball.

70
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,585
Get 'em off.

71
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:08,384
Don't you do that again.

72
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,787
A hundred and sixty.

73
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:14,895
How come the papers
don't say that?

74
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:17,993
- Do you believe the papers or me?
- What do I know?

75
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,834
I've been out risking my neck,
laying phony leads.

76
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:23,671
You've been in here,
sitting on the glue.

77
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:26,143
Well, why don't you ask
Miss America there?

78
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:28,305
She's the money lady.

79
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:32,580
Hey, it was a quarter million,
wasn't it?

80
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:35,951
Two hundred grand?

81
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:39,457
One lousy hundred sixty...

82
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,318
Don't do it, Iggy.

83
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:45,694
What I want to know is,
how come it don't bother you, huh?

84
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,066
Two of you wouldn't
have cooked this up?

85
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:52,571
Oh, come on, Iggy.
You're more of a drag than she is.

86
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:55,004
All right,
what are we gonna do about her?

87
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:59,204
To tell you the truth,
she's been a pretty good girl.

88
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:03,180
No hysteriaville, no gas.
No struggling.

89
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:05,717
She's got consideration
for other people.

90
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:07,980
I say we ought to
turn her off right now.

91
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:10,249
Is that another one
of your big ideas?

92
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,117
You see this?

93
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:16,355
Everyone in town is gonna be lookin'
at our girl's picture.

94
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:20,092
They dig her now,
all those helpful little citizens.

95
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:24,603
And that one little old man,
Eyewitness Charlie, with 20l20 vision.

96
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,070
Who always happens
to be looking out a window

97
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:29,073
when you're dragging out a body.

98
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:33,475
- What's the action then?
- We cool it, cool it, all of us.

99
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,505
- Cool it.
- Mother, I'm gonna take this gag off.

100
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:40,176
You got any ideas about noise?

101
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:44,082
All right. That's good...

102
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:47,648
...because I've got sensitive ears,

103
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:50,389
and when someone yells,
I do things.

104
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:53,330
Things like make me hate myself
in the morning.

105
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:56,964
Now, Mother, here's the picture.

106
00:08:57,036 --> 00:09:00,369
We hole up here a few days.
We're stuck with you.

107
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:03,931
Now, we don't want you getting sick
or scared or finking out.

108
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:07,446
That's no good.
Not for us. Not for you.

109
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:11,148
What are you
gonna do with me?

110
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:14,642
Well, first you've got
to believe one thing.

111
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,621
One killing, more or less,
won't make any difference.

112
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,089
We've got nothin' to lose.

113
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:24,221
Anybody we knock off from here on in,
is just a little more gravy, see?

114
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:27,630
- I understand.
- That's solid, Moms.

115
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,725
Come on.
Let's make with the cookin'.

116
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:31,929
Iggy brought groceries. Come on.

117
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:39,509
We got steaks, we got salmon.
What's it gonna be?

118
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,376
Steak. I'll have mine rare.

119
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:44,109
Make mine well.
I can't stand the sight of blood.

120
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:46,879
Some desperate character
I got for a partner, huh?

121
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,973
All right, fleabag,
get out of here.

122
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,942
- Let him stay a while, Dan.
- What for?

123
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:14,309
- I like cats.
- You like cats?

124
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,975
Yeah. I ever tell you about
Acey-Deucy, my old cat?

125
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:22,180
- No, and you ain't going to.
- As long as he was alive, I was lucky.

126
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:25,485
- He was a real friend.
- You're breaking my heart.

127
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:27,822
Come on, I want to talk to you.

128
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:32,853
Don't stand there flapping your ears.
Make with the cooking.

129
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:35,764
I like the cat.

130
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,596
Don't forget, I'm watching you.

131
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:42,230
I don't trust that dame.
I don't trust her.

132
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:44,839
I don't want you to trust her.

133
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:49,303
The thing is,
she might play along

134
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:52,317
if we con her into thinking
we might turn her loose.

135
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:58,218
- You wouldn't, would you?
- Are you out of your mind?

136
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,537
Nah, you're kidding.

137
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:31,685
What's holding you up?
Move it, will you?

138
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:34,191
I think my watch stopped.

139
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,387
What do I care?
What's with the watch?

140
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:39,863
- I wanted to time the steaks.
- That's a clock, ain't it?

141
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:41,832
Move it, will you?

142
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:02,644
What do you think you're doing?

143
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,190
Not that way, Dan,
somebody will hear.

144
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:08,283
He wanted to go out.

145
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,760
I... I didn't make a break.

146
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,924
I... I wouldn't do it. I wouldn't.

147
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:17,631
Okay.

148
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:21,739
Okay.

149
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:25,376
Because I got friends.

150
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:28,870
Ten little lead-nosed friends in here.

151
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:32,212
And they all run faster
than you do, Moms.

152
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:36,387
I know.

153
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:38,650
Now, let's get one thing straight.

154
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:41,655
Don't touch that door again.

155
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:44,423
Not that door,
or any window in there.

156
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:46,829
- You got that straight?
- Got it?

157
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:52,799
- Yes.
- You just used up all your luck, lady.

158
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:54,840
Now, don't try me again.

159
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:26,000
How about Thursday night
at the drive-in?

160
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:28,972
- What's playing?
- Night of the Surfer.

161
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,805
- What was that we saw tonight?
- Surfer Beach Party.

162
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:35,210
- And the night before last?
- Son of Surf and Sinbad the Surfer.

163
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:37,772
- Double feature.
- Canoe...

164
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,943
Do you ever get a spooky feeling

165
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,920
that we keep seeing
the same movie over and over?

166
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,388
And all they do
is change the titles a little?

167
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:47,721
Yeah, it's terrific stuff, isn't it?

168
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:52,389
Couldn't we, just once,
see a nice quiet movie,

169
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:54,694
where boy meets girl,
they have problems

170
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:58,362
which aren't weird, they fall in love,
and live happily ever after?

171
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:01,372
Why would you want
to see unhealthy stuff like that?

172
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,204
Oh, I don't know. Maybe once
I'd like to go to a movie

173
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:05,903
where I don't get seasick.

174
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:08,913
I'll make you a deal.
You go with me Thursday night,

175
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:13,111
next time I'll take you to one of those
happily ever after clambakes. Deal?

176
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:16,052
- I guess.
- Where's the thing playing?

177
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:20,292
Oh, who knows? Maybe they don't
make movies like that anymore.

178
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,088
Well, sure.
You wanna know why?

179
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:25,324
Because people don't want to
be depressed by all that slop.

180
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:31,335
Ha! That Henderson boy went
right into the house with her.

181
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:37,471
Right into the house.

182
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,205
She and the Henderson boy,
the two of them.

183
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,008
Why shouldn't he go
in the house?

184
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:45,539
He's been hanging around
since he was old enough to wave bye-bye.

185
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:48,018
Nevertheless,
they happen to represent

186
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:51,454
two separate and distinct
members of the opposite sex.

187
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:54,686
- Alone, in that house.
- You tell them, kid.

188
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,728
With their parents all over Europe,

189
00:14:56,795 --> 00:14:59,263
someone's got to keep an eye
on those girls.

190
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:00,662
Meantime,

191
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:04,635
by authority of
the Federal Communications Commission,

192
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,933
and the grace of
a kindly Providence,

193
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:10,305
which gave me the power of
not having to listen to people,

194
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:12,640
I am now going off the air.

195
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:16,112
Don't you dare take that thing off!
I haven't finished talking.

196
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:19,173
Good night, old woman.
I can't hear what you're sayin',

197
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:23,950
but whatever it is,
I disagree with you 100 percent.

198
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:35,460
You're out of peanut butter.
How come there aren't any olives?

199
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:38,401
- Put them on the shopping list.
- Okay.

200
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,301
Hi, DC.

201
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:45,003
You know, Patti,
sometimes you worry me.

202
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:47,375
You don't eat enough
to keep a bird alive.

203
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:50,745
Canoe. This is just a wild idea,
but has it ever occurred to you

204
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:53,284
there's more to life
than surfing and eating?

205
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:55,616
- Like what?
- Forget it.

206
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:59,149
I just realized
I was talking to myself.

207
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:02,125
- Hey, your folks are in Venice.
- I know.

208
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:06,153
Your father got indigestion
from a clam sauce, but feels better now.

209
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:07,789
Huh.

210
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:11,862
Bills, bills, bills.
Look at this, nothing but bills.

211
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:17,540
Surf news should be
comin' up about now.

212
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:20,578
You listen. I'm gonna straighten up
and go off to bed.

213
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,443
- Okay.
- Hi, DC.

214
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:30,746
Watch the crumbs, will you, fellas?

215
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,757
Pass the word. Watch the crumbs.

216
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,225
According to authorities,

217
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:38,320
the desperados and their victim
may have traveled north

218
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:40,763
in an effort to escape this area.

219
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,996
- Their car was discovered on...
- That's Miss Miller.

220
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:45,696
...outside of Fresno.
- Who?

221
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:49,969
Miss Miller, the Christmas Club window
at the bank.

222
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:53,876
- I've known her for years.
- Oh, yeah, so have I.

223
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:55,971
She goes to our Laundromat.

224
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:58,448
Kind of creepy, isn't it?

225
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:02,453
All this happening in your
own neighborhood, to people you know.

226
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:05,422
Want me to stick around
until your sister comes home?

227
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:08,016
- You know, the protecting bit.
- No, thanks.

228
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,457
All right.

229
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:13,498
And now, surfers,
here's the word for tomorrow.

230
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:18,093
This is your Weather Gremmie with
the beach news for the a.m.

231
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:22,106
Goleta to Zuma,
sea conditions light to moderate.

232
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:26,634
Malibu, moderate in the early morning,
with some real heavies expected.

233
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,681
Hey, Pat, surf's up tomorrow at Malibu.
You want to go?

234
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:31,545
Yeah, sure.
Good night.

235
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:33,414
Good night.

236
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:36,716
That's all for tonight, surfers.
The word is "go."

237
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:39,189
See you at the beach.

238
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:42,489
Mmm. Come on, here. Come on.

239
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,862
That's a good boy.
Good one.

240
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:53,536
Wow. 11:15?
Man, I gotta get some sleep.

241
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:34,303
- I thought we'd almost had it there.
- Sorry, one of Patti's friends.

242
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:36,244
Oh.

243
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:39,244
- Is it a date, then?
- Mm-hm.

244
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:42,719
You won't regret it, I'm sure.
Mother is an extremely fine cook.

245
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,882
- I'm sure she is, Gregory.
- Mother cooks the best duck.

246
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:49,359
And as for the duck,
did I tell you it was a Gadwall?

247
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:51,958
No, I don't believe you did.

248
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:55,727
I, uh, stood all day
in a duck blind to get it.

249
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,599
In the pouring rain.
I almost got pneumonia.

250
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:02,970
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- No. It's all right. It was worth it.

251
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,703
Well worth it.
It's a beautiful creature.

252
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:08,837
Perfectly beautiful. Superb eating.

253
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:12,612
Mother... Mother prepares duck

254
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:16,176
in the classic, old-fashioned way.

255
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:18,689
She hangs it out
on the screen porch

256
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:21,624
for 48 hours before cooking.

257
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:23,888
It makes all the difference
in the world.

258
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:27,193
- All the difference in the world.
- I, um...

259
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:29,666
I'm looking forward
to meeting your mother.

260
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:31,259
I've heard so much about her.

261
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:34,828
I know you two are gonna be
the very best of friends.

262
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,509
And now, uh...

263
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:40,568
- Good night.
- Good night.

264
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,215
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Mm-hm.

265
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:46,979
- Same time as usual?
- Hmm.

266
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:39,029
Quiet, Blitzy.

267
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:44,666
Good night,
my little beauties.

268
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:14,630
Oh!

269
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:39,820
Okay, where's the duck?

270
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,793
- I beg your pardon.
- I want my duck!

271
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:46,030
Your duck?

272
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:48,072
If you please.

273
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,074
I'm sorry,
I really don't know...

274
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:53,305
Where is that sneaky,
miserable guttersnipe?

275
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:56,310
- He's got my duck.
- What duck?

276
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:58,975
Don't you dare pretend with me.

277
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:01,849
- I saw him come in here with it.
- You saw who come in?

278
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,354
Patricia Randall,
I have had all I can take.

279
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:08,018
That rotten cat of yours,
he molests my prize albino fantails,

280
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:11,392
crawls all over my car every time
I wash it with his muddy paws.

281
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:12,953
He digs up Mother's bulbs.

282
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:15,795
He's driven my dog to the brink
of a nervous breakdown.

283
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:17,391
You mean DC?

284
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:20,461
Well, I'm sorry,
but actually, he isn't my cat.

285
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:22,131
He isn't anybody's cat.

286
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:25,506
What are you talking about?
He lives here, doesn't he?

287
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:28,978
Of course, but don't you see?
You don't own someone like DC.

288
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:30,947
He's family.

289
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:34,747
Oh,
but what am I gonna do?

290
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:38,150
Shoot. I spent all day
in a duck blind.

291
00:22:38,223 --> 00:22:39,986
Humph! Pouring rain.

292
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:42,117
And I get one duck.

293
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:45,186
One single Gadwall.

294
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:49,222
And that flea-raddled fiend
had to go and steal it.

295
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:53,067
I know you're upset,
but be honest. It was dark, wasn't it?

296
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:56,164
It could have been that nasty cat
from across the street.

297
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:59,005
The one who does everything
that DC gets blamed for.

298
00:22:59,077 --> 00:23:01,409
Now, do you think...

299
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,608
Oh, DC, how could you?

300
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:08,308
Hold this.

301
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:11,151
DC, give that to me this instant.

302
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:15,691
I want you to know
I'm very, very disappointed in you.

303
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,431
Oh.

304
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:33,110
Oh, Gregory, I am sorry.

305
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:35,578
I can't think what
could have come over him.

306
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:39,344
Bad, bad cat. Ah!

307
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,750
"Bad, bad cat"?

308
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:44,853
You're a menace
to the whole neighborhood.

309
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:47,084
Mark you, if I had my way,

310
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:49,457
the authorities would
do away with you.

311
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:51,325
Now, wait a minute, Gregory.

312
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:53,762
DC's a cat.
He can't help his instincts.

313
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:55,857
He's a hunter, just like you are,

314
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:59,392
only he's not stupid enough
to sit out in the pouring rain all day.

315
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:00,768
Well!

316
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:04,832
Just let me make myself quite clear.
You better keep him locked up at night.

317
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:09,540
The next time I find him at our place,
I'll give him a pantsful of buckshot.

318
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:11,946
Nine times, if necessary.

319
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:19,321
I know.
I don't care for him much, either.

320
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,893
But he does have a point,
don't you think?

321
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:26,797
Was that Gregory
I heard down there?

322
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:29,231
- Correct.
- He sounded angry.

323
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,599
Yeah, I believe he was.

324
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:35,106
- What goes on around here, anyway?
- Nothing, nothing at all.

325
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:38,472
DC just happened to take a duck
off Gregory's back porch.

326
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:42,739
- "Happened" to take a duck?
- Yes.

327
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:46,079
Gregory came stamping and banging
over here to find it.

328
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:50,315
Furious. Made a perfect fool of himself.
I don't think he's a stable person.

329
00:24:50,388 --> 00:24:53,084
- There goes my duck dinner.
- Your what?

330
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:57,094
He invited me to his house for dinner.
His mother was gonna fix the duck.

331
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,590
Fix the...

332
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:03,600
Ingrid, don't you see?
You're walking into a trap.

333
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:07,627
For goodness sakes, Gregory drives me
to work in the morning.

334
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:10,174
At night he picks me up
and he takes me home.

335
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:12,176
If he wants to go
to all that trouble,

336
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:15,213
the least I can do
is be courteous if he asks me to dinner.

337
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,510
How can you be so blind?

338
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:20,176
It began with
the old car pool routine, right?

339
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:24,188
Why shouldn't it? His law office
happens to be next door to where I work.

340
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:27,419
But the point is, there used to be
five people in that car,

341
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:31,053
then Gregory traded in his sedan
for a two-seater sports car.

342
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:34,496
And Mr. Burke,
Miss Patters and Miss Mosely

343
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:39,230
were ruthlessly squeezed out
to find other transportation, correct?

344
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:42,432
- Now, listen...
- Creeping matrimony, that's what it is.

345
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:46,708
The car pool, the duck dinner,
a movie here and there.

346
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:50,578
Inky, you're taking the gas
and you don't even know it.

347
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:52,844
Thank you, dear,
I'm sure you mean well,

348
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:55,386
but I think I can handle
the Gregory situation

349
00:25:55,453 --> 00:25:57,751
in my own bumbling way.

350
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:02,051
I'm sorry, but I suppose at your age,

351
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:05,255
when that important person
hasn't come into your life,

352
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:08,094
- well...
- Well, what?

353
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,164
Well, I suppose a tinge,

354
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:16,037
just the faintest tinge, of desperation,
begins to blow your judgment.

355
00:26:17,008 --> 00:26:18,703
Good night.

356
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:23,009
I can assure you, there is no tinge
of desperation in my outlook.

357
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,914
- And my vision is exceptionally clear.
- Good.

358
00:26:25,984 --> 00:26:28,646
Which, I might add,
brings us to your friends.

359
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,210
- My friends?
- Yes, dear.

360
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:32,950
The one we've been tripping over
all these years.

361
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:35,652
Canoe? That's very unfair.

362
00:26:36,194 --> 00:26:39,686
Canoe is...
well, he's just defenseless.

363
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:41,925
He's very sweet and young, and...

364
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,197
...needs help.
- I certainly agree he needs something.

365
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,864
Doesn't he do anything
but mope around in shorts

366
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:51,602
- and eat us out of house and home?
- Just shows how little you know him.

367
00:26:51,676 --> 00:26:54,338
- Canoe has plenty of ambition.
- What?

368
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:57,472
To be the first 50-year-old surfer
at Santa Monica?

369
00:26:57,549 --> 00:27:00,575
If you ask me, he's...
What's the matter?

370
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:03,052
DC's wearing a wristwatch.

371
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:06,852
Well, what will that dear, sweet,
innocent cat be bringing home next?

372
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:09,985
The Hope Diamond, I imagine.

373
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:12,529
- Where do you suppose he got it?
- I don't know.

374
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:16,465
Probably some child slipped it on,
or some teenager put it on for a joke.

375
00:27:16,534 --> 00:27:20,231
Good night. Check with lost and found
in the morning.

376
00:27:29,914 --> 00:27:31,745
Ingrid?

377
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:36,820
Look. Someone started to scratch
something on the casing.

378
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:40,824
See? "H-E,"
and that looks like part of an L.

379
00:27:40,892 --> 00:27:44,055
H-E-L...

380
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:48,065
I'll bet somebody was trying to write
"help" and they were interrupted.

381
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:49,930
Somebody's in trouble.

382
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:52,595
What cooks in that wild
little head of yours now?

383
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:55,231
Somebody's in trouble.
I feel it in my bones.

384
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:58,867
You bet. Now get out and let me
go to sleep. I'm a working girl.

385
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:02,010
Don't you think
we ought to do something?

386
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,173
Good night.

387
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,496
Come on, DC, give.

388
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:20,622
Someone does need help, don't they?

389
00:28:23,768 --> 00:28:27,260
I know you could find a way to tell me
if you really wanted to.

390
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,902
A smart cat like you.

391
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:37,146
You can be such a rat sometimes.

392
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:50,928
Don't say anything,
just point me towards the coffee.

393
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:52,895
What's wrong with you?

394
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:55,364
I didn't close my eyes once last night.

395
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:59,733
Oh, I've got huge dark circles
under my eyes.

396
00:28:59,804 --> 00:29:02,773
- And me so young.
- What's bothering you?

397
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:06,975
I just couldn't stop thinking
about this watch.

398
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:10,173
Especially that pitiful
cry for help on the back.

399
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:12,876
Oh, you're not going to start that,
so help me...

400
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:16,045
You know, I thought
and thought and thought,

401
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:18,555
and I think I finally know the answer.

402
00:29:18,623 --> 00:29:21,114
The watch belongs to her.

403
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:22,989
- The kidnapped woman?
- Yeah.

404
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:25,962
Come off it. How far out can you get?
Does it have a name?

405
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:28,726
No, but it's exactly the sort of watch

406
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,768
a woman like that would wear:

407
00:29:30,835 --> 00:29:34,862
Feminine, yet...
bank tellerish, if you see what I mean.

408
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:38,204
Patti, you are absolutely impossible.

409
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:40,210
Have a nice day at the office, Inky.

410
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:44,681
You've got that terrible

411
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:47,479
butter-won't-melt-in-your-mouth
expression.

412
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:49,816
I know what's going on
in your little mind,

413
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:52,083
- and I forbid it.
- What do you mean?

414
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:55,957
You're not going to over dramatize this,
like you do everything else.

415
00:29:56,027 --> 00:29:58,825
I absolutely forbid you to get
the police stirred up

416
00:29:58,897 --> 00:30:02,355
with another of your hallucinations
about people in trouble.

417
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:04,993
You're not to go near
the police with that watch.

418
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:06,730
- Certainly.
- Bye.

419
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,797
- Good morning, Ingrid.
- Good morning.

420
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,775
Naturally, I wouldn't go to the police.

421
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,711
This is a job for the FBI.

422
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:38,766
May I help you?

423
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:42,739
- Yes, I'd like to see a, uh...
- We call them agents here.

424
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:45,571
- Yes, I'd like to see an agent.
- May I ask what about?

425
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:48,043
I have information
about one of your crimes.

426
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:51,548
- Thank you. Would you wait over there?
- Yes.

427
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:59,285
- These are for you, Mr. Hart.
- Thank you.

428
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,257
- I'm back at 11:00.
- Yes, sir.

429
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:03,920
- Morning, Hart.
- Good morning, Mr. Kelso.

430
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:06,293
- Hi, Vicky, anything for me?
- No, sir.

431
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:09,891
If Mr. Paul calls about
the bank records, put him through.

432
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:11,458
See you around.

433
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,467
- Is he an agent?
- Yes, he is.

434
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:20,010
- Nice face, hasn't he?
- Why, yes.

435
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:28,178
Yes, Mr. Ellender?
The messenger hasn't arrived yet.

436
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:32,088
I can put a tracer on it.

437
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:36,256
We haven't heard
from Denver all morning.

438
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:40,127
I'll connect you with Agent Morrow.
He's got the reports on that case.

439
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:19,236
Well, we've got 22 Howards
in Los Angeles County.

440
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:20,965
Better start right at the top.

441
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:27,407
Mr. Kelso, I have something to report
on one of your cases.

442
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:29,878
It's a family cat.
He's called DC.

443
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,075
That means "Darn Cat."
Daddy named him,

444
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:35,381
he called him something worse,
Mother won't let us use that.

445
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:38,547
Excuse me.
First, what is your name?

446
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:41,023
Patricia Randall,
808 Pendleton Avenue.

447
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:47,060
Uh-huh, and what is
this information you have, Miss Randall?

448
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,758
It's DC, our cat.

449
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:52,599
He likes to prowl around at night,
as cats do. Nothing wrong with that.

450
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:56,606
And he likes people, as a general rule,
if they're nice and give him food.

451
00:32:56,674 --> 00:32:58,073
He goes back.

452
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:00,610
I think he has a regular route
to pick out food,

453
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:02,578
sort of like a milkman in reverse.

454
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:06,310
- And this relates to one of our cases?
- Yes. Yes, it does.

455
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:09,182
Last night
DC was out roaming around,

456
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:11,813
and stole a duck from Mr. Benson
down the street.

457
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:14,585
Ah, Miss, um, Randall...

458
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,923
I'm afraid that
that's a police matter.

459
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:20,988
You see, our jurisdiction is limited
to certain fields of investigation.

460
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:23,898
At the present time,
duck stealing is not one of them.

461
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:26,698
How about bank robbery
and kidnapping?

462
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:34,209
Maybe I'd better hear
the rest of your story.

463
00:33:35,113 --> 00:33:37,138
Thank you.

464
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:41,845
Well, last night DC came home
wearing a wristwatch.

465
00:33:43,254 --> 00:33:45,814
- Wearing a wristwatch?
- Yes.

466
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:48,723
- Instead of his collar.
- Oh.

467
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:53,787
And I couldn't help thinking what
I would do if I were poor Miss Miller,

468
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,698
held prisoner by two hoodlums,

469
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:59,498
- and a stray cat came wandering in.
- Mm-hm.

470
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:04,834
Don't you see? I'd try to put
something of mine on the cat as a clue.

471
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:08,208
Like a wristwatch, maybe even
try to scratch something on it.

472
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:09,940
Do you have this wristwatch?

473
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:14,007
Mr. Kelso, I knew you'd understand.
That's why I selected you personally.

474
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:16,619
Here.

475
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,082
You see, of course, on the back,

476
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:23,650
where she started to scratch
the word "help,"

477
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,491
- and was interrupted.
- Uh-huh.

478
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:29,363
"H-E..."
And that squiggle could be an "L."

479
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:32,995
Well, that doesn't quite
spell "help," does it?

480
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:36,165
She was wearing a wristwatch
at the time of her abduction.

481
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,640
We have only a superficial description.

482
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:42,975
- This may or may not be the watch.
- But wouldn't it be enough to start on?

483
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:47,216
I wonder if you could wait here
for just a few moments?

484
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:50,220
Of course. My entire day
is at your disposal.

485
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,987
Thank you, Miss Randall.

486
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:58,395
- It's a goofy idea.
- That's what I thought too, sir.

487
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:01,330
- The only thing is, I like it.
- You do, sir?

488
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:04,300
I don't like this paper chase
someone's leading us on.

489
00:35:04,368 --> 00:35:07,394
Those 20-dollar bills from the bank
we've been picking up

490
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:11,568
- at convenient towns up the valley.
- They went in another direction?

491
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:15,134
Or stayed here in the city.
This watch lead ties in with that.

492
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,178
- How's your workload, Kelso?
- Me, sir?

493
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:21,616
Uh, well, I'm going over
old bank records on Johnny the Cooch.

494
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:24,484
- We're ready to trip him up.
- The Cooch can wait.

495
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:26,318
Kidnapping takes priority.

496
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:29,223
I want you to set up surveillance
and tail this cat.

497
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:31,818
- Tail the cat?
- He may take us to the criminals.

498
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,029
That's all.

499
00:35:34,098 --> 00:35:37,067
Actually, I don't have
any experience in tailing cats.

500
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,296
For that matter, who does?

501
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:44,407
Sorry, sir. You wish me to set up
a surveillance on this informant,

502
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:47,035
exactly as if we thought of him
as a person?

503
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:51,878
Unless, of course, it works out better
to think of him as a cat.

504
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:58,848
Sir, I think it's only fair to tell you,
I don't get on well with cats.

505
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:01,323
There's a kind of an antagonism
between us.

506
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:03,860
- Is that so?
- Yes, and I have a slight allergy.

507
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:08,092
Allergy? I know the medical records
of every man in this office.

508
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,361
Have you been keeping
something from me?

509
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:12,595
It's a very small allergy, sir.

510
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,695
- Hardly worth mentioning.
- Don't.

511
00:36:14,772 --> 00:36:17,832
Stay in touch. I'm available
on this case 24 hours a day.

512
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:20,800
Yes, sir.

513
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:26,082
Sir, it's just that every time
I'm around c...

514
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:28,141
C...

515
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:30,483
Gesundheit, and good luck.

516
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:34,451
Thank you, sir.

517
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:43,891
Yes, a lot of people
are gonna be sorry

518
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:46,334
for the things they said about DC.

519
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:50,340
Wait till they find out
he's working with the FBI.

520
00:36:50,408 --> 00:36:52,399
I don't think we should expose

521
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:55,206
your cat's relationship with us
at this time.

522
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:57,907
I'd like to remain
as inconspicuous as possible.

523
00:36:57,982 --> 00:37:01,418
You don't want everyone in the
neighborhood to know who you are?

524
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:04,079
Exactly. People tend
to become over stimulated

525
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:06,851
when they discover an FBI man
in the neighborhood.

526
00:37:06,924 --> 00:37:10,451
It interferes with the quiet,
orderly process of investigation.

527
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,428
- Hmm.
- Especially kidnap cases.

528
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:14,987
See, this places the life
of the kidnap victim

529
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:17,034
into additional jeopardy.

530
00:37:17,101 --> 00:37:19,228
We've gotta not
generate too much heat?

531
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:21,999
The kidnappers'll chicken out,
kill Miss Miller,

532
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:24,098
dispose of the remains
and take off?

533
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:27,076
Uh, that's one way to put it, yes.

534
00:37:27,144 --> 00:37:28,133
Oh.

535
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:36,083
You go first.

536
00:37:36,153 --> 00:37:39,384
Remember, everything
quiet, calm, inconspicuous.

537
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:41,983
Quiet, calm, inconspicuous.

538
00:38:17,028 --> 00:38:20,794
That brazen creature.
Right in broad daylight!

539
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:22,958
What are you cackling about now?

540
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:26,997
A strange man just went
into the house with Patti.

541
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:30,563
- So what?
- He was carrying a bag.

542
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:33,132
Don't get yourself up
in a sweat, old woman.

543
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:36,611
- It's probably the plumber.
- It was not the plumber!

544
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:40,617
- This man was nicely dressed.
- That's the way plumbers dress now.

545
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:42,550
The prices they charge these days,

546
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:45,282
I'm surprised he wasn't
wearing a tuxedo.

547
00:38:49,226 --> 00:38:52,957
Do you have any friends?
People who are in and out all the time?

548
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:55,225
I'm afraid so.
Father always complained

549
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:59,065
we were running a rehabilitation center
for punch-drunk juveniles.

550
00:38:59,136 --> 00:39:03,197
Uh-huh. I'd prefer a room
on the second floor, actually.

551
00:39:03,274 --> 00:39:06,801
To reduce the chance of somebody
coming in and finding me at work.

552
00:39:06,877 --> 00:39:09,311
- This your room?
- Ingrid's. My sister.

553
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,644
- Oh. Would she mind?
- No, not at all.

554
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:14,150
- She'd be only too happy to help.
- Good.

555
00:39:14,218 --> 00:39:16,413
That's the side door
from the kitchen?

556
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:20,617
Yes, that's the exit DC uses when
he goes out for an evening on the town.

557
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:24,127
Uh-huh. Tonight, we'll set up
our communications unit in here.

558
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,753
Whatever you like.

559
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:29,891
All right. And now, I suppose
I'd better meet the c... c...

560
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:34,604
Bless you. What did you say?

561
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:39,567
I said I...

562
00:39:39,643 --> 00:39:41,736
...suppose I...

563
00:39:41,812 --> 00:39:44,975
...better meet the...
- Oh.

564
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:49,417
Ah, DC. He's probably goofing around
under the bed or something.

565
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:51,421
That's his favorite spot.

566
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:54,219
Ah, your sins have caught up with you.

567
00:39:54,992 --> 00:39:57,392
This is your FBI.

568
00:39:57,461 --> 00:40:00,897
Well. This is the...

569
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:03,864
...informant, as we say
down at the office.

570
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:06,960
Hear that, DC?
You're the informant now.

571
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:13,072
Nice little kitty cat.
Good, good kitty cat.

572
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:15,135
- Is he friendly?
- Mm-hm.

573
00:40:16,213 --> 00:40:17,976
He almost got me that time.

574
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:20,539
He's all right.
Don't make any sudden moves

575
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:23,519
because it tends
to set off his reflexes or something.

576
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:27,148
Uh-huh. Oh, yeah.
Doesn't seem to like me, does he?

577
00:40:27,224 --> 00:40:29,556
I guess that's a bad sign,
the kind of people

578
00:40:29,627 --> 00:40:32,528
- that animals don't like?
- It doesn't mean a thing.

579
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:34,928
DC and Daddy loathe one another,

580
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:36,967
and Daddy's
the Lamb of the Year.

581
00:40:37,034 --> 00:40:40,435
Say, I wonder if you would excuse me

582
00:40:40,504 --> 00:40:43,871
for just one minute. I think we better
get this show on the road.

583
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:46,933
- What are you going to do?
- I have some work to do with DC

584
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:49,809
before we start our surveillance.
Photos and so on.

585
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:53,816
- Oh, for the papers, you mean?
- No, for our own people to study.

586
00:40:53,884 --> 00:40:57,513
See, there's finger... paw prints,
plaster impressions...

587
00:40:57,588 --> 00:41:01,024
...samples of his fur...

588
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:03,959
Bless you.
You're catching a terrible cold.

589
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:07,361
DC, pull yourself together.
You want me to get you something?

590
00:41:07,431 --> 00:41:11,299
No, no. I'm fine. It's just
a slight allergy I have around c... c...

591
00:41:11,368 --> 00:41:13,393
- Around, uh...
- Oh.

592
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:16,804
Wonder if you'd put him on the bed
and let me get a picture of him?

593
00:41:19,276 --> 00:41:22,143
- There you go.
- Could you get him to stand up?

594
00:41:22,213 --> 00:41:25,011
- I'll get a full-figure shot.
- Oh, yes.

595
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:26,981
Uh...

596
00:41:28,385 --> 00:41:31,843
There we go.
Come on, DC, cooperate.

597
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:39,195
Come on, DC, you're working
for the FBI now. There.

598
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:41,595
There.

599
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:47,134
Uh, that's not any good.
We can't see him properly.

600
00:41:47,204 --> 00:41:49,672
Wait a minute.
Here's what he likes.

601
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,230
Here.

602
00:41:57,147 --> 00:41:58,876
Where'd he go?

603
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:02,149
Back under the bed.

604
00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:05,782
I should've taken the paw prints first.

605
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:08,256
You're right.
He's not about to come out.

606
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:11,294
Can't we just get a hold of him there
and drag him out?

607
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:14,354
Sure, if you want to lose a hand.

608
00:42:16,233 --> 00:42:19,498
The Bureau has spent $19,800
of the taxpayers' money

609
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:23,233
training me for emergencies.
They expect something for their cash.

610
00:42:23,307 --> 00:42:26,401
I have no intention of being
intimidated by this c... c...

611
00:42:27,811 --> 00:42:29,369
...animal.

612
00:42:29,446 --> 00:42:32,506
- Well, you are a very brave man.
- Thank you.

613
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:36,349
All right, when I count three,
we'll both grab him at the same time.

614
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,887
- But move fast.
- Let's go.

615
00:42:37,955 --> 00:42:39,513
- You ready?
- Let's go. Yeah.

616
00:42:39,957 --> 00:42:43,154
One, two, three.

617
00:42:50,935 --> 00:42:54,393
Oh, DC. You're bleeding.

618
00:42:54,471 --> 00:42:56,871
No, it's nothing.
Probably just an artery.

619
00:42:56,941 --> 00:42:59,409
Say, would you get him
down for me, please?

620
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:01,273
You're not going ahead with this?

621
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:03,540
I'm afraid you underestimate me.

622
00:43:03,614 --> 00:43:05,878
We shall proceed
with the paw printing.

623
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,051
All right.

624
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:12,489
Come on now, DC,
don't be difficult.

625
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:16,021
- What's that?
- It's ink.

626
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:18,926
Ink? Can't we do that
in the bathroom?

627
00:43:18,996 --> 00:43:21,556
Ingrid will murder me
if we get ink on the rug.

628
00:43:21,632 --> 00:43:23,224
Oh, sure. Let's go.

629
00:43:24,468 --> 00:43:27,767
Don't make such a fuss, DC.

630
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:30,136
You should be ashamed of yourself.

631
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:34,642
Sorry about the washing.
Girl's bathroom, you know.

632
00:43:34,712 --> 00:43:37,146
- It's okay.
- DC!

633
00:43:37,214 --> 00:43:40,012
- Come on.
- Good old kitty cat.

634
00:43:40,084 --> 00:43:43,019
Nice, nice kitty cat.

635
00:43:47,024 --> 00:43:49,356
Spread this out over there.

636
00:43:51,095 --> 00:43:55,088
Let's see. I guess I'll put the paw print
in the space for the thumb.

637
00:43:55,165 --> 00:43:58,100
Oh, hurry.
I can't hold him any longer.

638
00:43:58,168 --> 00:44:00,329
Oh, all right.

639
00:44:00,404 --> 00:44:03,771
Here we go, now.
Just relax there.

640
00:44:03,841 --> 00:44:06,537
Take it easy, there, now.
It won't hurt a bit.

641
00:44:08,512 --> 00:44:10,605
Oh, Canoe.

642
00:44:10,681 --> 00:44:13,275
- Can I what?
- No, he's a friend of mine.

643
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:16,046
- I promised to go to the beach.
- That's not so good.

644
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,179
Is he one of the kids
that hangs around?

645
00:44:18,255 --> 00:44:21,884
Yes, and he has kitchen privileges,
and he's as easy to get rid of...

646
00:44:21,959 --> 00:44:23,950
Try to get rid of him.
It's important.

647
00:44:24,028 --> 00:44:26,929
- What do I say?
- Anything. Just keep him away.

648
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:28,726
All right.

649
00:44:30,067 --> 00:44:32,126
Hurry back,
for the love of heaven.

650
00:44:35,472 --> 00:44:37,770
Okay, tiger,
it's either you or me.

651
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:53,522
- Patti?
- Yes?

652
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:55,990
What kind of a get-up is that
to go surfing in?

653
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:58,460
Want the crowd
to think you're an eccentric?

654
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:02,761
Please go on without me.
I don't think I can make it today.

655
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:07,130
Well, Patti, are you all right?
I've never seen you like this before.

656
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:10,037
- Can I help?
- It's all right.

657
00:45:10,107 --> 00:45:13,804
I just feel terribly, terribly weak.

658
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:17,608
If you're so weak,
how come I can't get through the door?

659
00:45:17,681 --> 00:45:19,581
Please go, Canoe.

660
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:21,982
I can't bear you
to see me looking like this.

661
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:27,156
What was that?

662
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:29,886
- What was what?
- That bloodcurdling scream.

663
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,485
Canoe, will you please go?

664
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:35,532
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
I was butting in on a murder.

665
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:39,126
Oh, don't be silly.

666
00:45:39,203 --> 00:45:42,695
You know how DC hates water.
He's having a bath.

667
00:45:42,773 --> 00:45:44,866
By himself?

668
00:45:44,942 --> 00:45:49,276
All right. If you won't go to the beach,
I'll make myself a sandwich.

669
00:45:49,346 --> 00:45:52,645
Kitchen privileges
are temporarily withdrawn.

670
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:07,760
He's gone.

671
00:46:08,298 --> 00:46:10,391
Paw prints everywhere!

672
00:46:10,467 --> 00:46:12,731
Yeah, except on the card.

673
00:46:12,803 --> 00:46:14,794
Oh, I'm sorry.

674
00:46:22,713 --> 00:46:25,273
Aha. The best paw print I ever made.

675
00:46:27,718 --> 00:46:30,881
The first point I wish to make
is that time is not on our side.

676
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:32,854
The word is move,
and move swiftly.

677
00:46:32,923 --> 00:46:37,121
We're gonna follow an informant whose
information may or may not be reliable.

678
00:46:37,194 --> 00:46:40,061
However, he could lead us
to the Miller kidnappers.

679
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:43,531
Okay, here's the physical.
- DC Randall.

680
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,864
- Siamese.
- Male.

681
00:46:45,936 --> 00:46:48,427
- Blue.
- 17 pounds.

682
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:52,533
- Seventeen pounds?
- Exactly.

683
00:46:54,545 --> 00:46:57,946
Hair, or in this case, fur:
Black streaked with tan and white.

684
00:46:58,015 --> 00:47:00,210
- You did say "fur"?
- Correct.

685
00:47:03,353 --> 00:47:06,379
- You want us to follow a cat?
- That's the assignment.

686
00:47:06,456 --> 00:47:08,890
How do you follow a cat?

687
00:47:08,959 --> 00:47:12,759
They go through fences and culverts.
They climb trees and phone poles.

688
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:15,663
Wither he goest, you will go.

689
00:47:20,037 --> 00:47:23,803
- You have a question, Graham?
- I've got an old dog

690
00:47:23,874 --> 00:47:26,468
who's a lot better
at tracking cats than I am.

691
00:47:26,543 --> 00:47:28,340
We don't have time for comments.

692
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:32,041
I'd like to remind you,
a woman's life is involved here.

693
00:47:32,115 --> 00:47:34,276
- Sorry.
- Okay.

694
00:47:34,618 --> 00:47:37,382
Now, tonight you'll take up
your initial positions

695
00:47:37,454 --> 00:47:40,890
in the area surrounding
the Randall house, here.

696
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:44,792
When the informant leaves,
it'll be our job to contain him loosely,

697
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:47,456
within a moving, fluid perimeter.

698
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:49,999
It's important he doesn't
become aware of us

699
00:47:50,067 --> 00:47:53,230
as this might alter
his regular nocturnal behavior.

700
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,148
Hold it.
Who do you think you're kidding?

701
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:08,684
- What do you mean?
- You think I don't know

702
00:48:08,752 --> 00:48:11,016
- what's going on upstairs?
- You do?

703
00:48:11,088 --> 00:48:14,182
I didn't come in from Stupidsville
on last night's bus.

704
00:48:14,258 --> 00:48:17,989
- You've got a woman in that apartment.
- Hold it. What does that mean?

705
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:21,030
Don't double-talk me.
I've got ears, haven't I?

706
00:48:21,098 --> 00:48:23,089
Uh, it's Dan's mother.

707
00:48:23,166 --> 00:48:26,693
She come in unexpected, sudden-like.
We didn't know. That's all.

708
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:29,000
I don't care if it's Pocahontas.

709
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:34,009
You got three people living there,
and that'll cost you another 20 dollars.

710
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:36,341
- I'll bring it right down.
- Don't bother.

711
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:38,973
I'll come up and get it.
I like to know my tenants.

712
00:48:39,049 --> 00:48:41,449
- Can't. She's sick.
- What's wrong with her?

713
00:48:41,518 --> 00:48:44,351
- Nothing catching, is it?
- It's her nervous system.

714
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:47,879
It's all fouled up.
She can't stand visitors.

715
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:53,457
Iggy.

716
00:48:57,334 --> 00:48:59,962
- We gotta leave, gotta get out of here.
- What for?

717
00:49:00,037 --> 00:49:02,437
The old battle-ax knows
we got a dame up here.

718
00:49:02,506 --> 00:49:05,407
She heard her talking.
I told her it was your mother.

719
00:49:05,475 --> 00:49:07,409
Why didn't you tell her
it was the TV?

720
00:49:07,477 --> 00:49:11,311
I told you a million times, the TV.

721
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:14,350
- I gotta talk to you. Private.
- Why private?

722
00:49:14,418 --> 00:49:18,320
- We got no secrets from Moms.
- Come on, will you? Please.

723
00:49:18,388 --> 00:49:20,754
All right, all right.

724
00:49:20,824 --> 00:49:23,019
Go in the kitchen
and get a glass of water.

725
00:49:23,093 --> 00:49:25,254
And stand by the sink,
where I can see you.

726
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:27,729
Okay, fill me in.

727
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:30,062
Well, I found a place.

728
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:31,657
Where?

729
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:35,364
I got a big bin I spotted
in an alley two blocks away.

730
00:49:35,439 --> 00:49:37,498
Back of a store,
where they dump trash.

731
00:49:37,574 --> 00:49:39,804
Not so good. It's too close.

732
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:44,645
Anyway, I don't like bodies.
They always turn up at the wrong times.

733
00:49:44,715 --> 00:49:48,674
We gotta unload her. The lady downstairs
is gonna start nosing around.

734
00:49:48,752 --> 00:49:51,687
I say we got it made,
just as long as we sit tight.

735
00:49:51,755 --> 00:49:55,213
- I say we make a move.
- We sweat it out right here.

736
00:49:55,292 --> 00:49:57,419
Listen, Dan...

737
00:49:57,494 --> 00:50:00,395
...anything else I play it your way,
right?

738
00:50:00,464 --> 00:50:03,331
- Just one condition.
- Who says you make conditions?

739
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:06,233
- Just one.
- Such as?

740
00:50:06,303 --> 00:50:07,964
She goes.

741
00:50:09,106 --> 00:50:12,906
All right. But not until later.

742
00:50:12,976 --> 00:50:15,308
And not in the trash bin.

743
00:50:15,379 --> 00:50:18,837
See if you can't lose the car somewhere,
get her out of the city.

744
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:22,844
You sure your sister
won't mind us using her room?

745
00:50:22,919 --> 00:50:25,410
No, not a bit. I told you,
she'd be happy to help.

746
00:50:25,489 --> 00:50:26,922
Good.

747
00:50:35,298 --> 00:50:37,459
Spires, this is Control.
Do you read me?

748
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:39,729
Sweet and clear. You reading me?

749
00:50:39,803 --> 00:50:42,670
Affirmative. Excuse me.
What's your exact position?

750
00:50:42,739 --> 00:50:46,675
In the alley, about 30 feet
from the Randall back gate.

751
00:50:46,743 --> 00:50:50,338
You're the only one who can see
the informant when he hits the alley.

752
00:50:50,414 --> 00:50:54,407
Let me know which way he turns.
Cahill, what's your field of vision?

753
00:50:54,484 --> 00:50:57,749
West of Whittier,
east of the bend in Wetherby Drive.

754
00:50:57,821 --> 00:51:02,019
- Stand by. About three minutes to go.
- You're young to be doing this work.

755
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:05,391
- I mean, it's terribly responsible.
- I'm really not that...

756
00:51:05,462 --> 00:51:07,930
...not that young.
Kelly, are you settled in?

757
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:12,367
Affirmative. South side of Maple,
50 feet from the junction with Wetherby.

758
00:51:12,436 --> 00:51:13,698
Got it.

759
00:51:16,373 --> 00:51:19,240
You're very athletic looking.
Do you surf?

760
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:21,573
Uh, no, not anymore.

761
00:51:21,645 --> 00:51:24,546
My legs always looked ridiculous
in those shorts.

762
00:51:24,614 --> 00:51:27,014
Besides, I was scared to death
half the time.

763
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:28,278
I don't believe that.

764
00:51:28,351 --> 00:51:32,151
Look at the brave, wonderful things
you FBI people do in your job.

765
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:34,417
Maybe we could
chat some other time, huh?

766
00:51:34,491 --> 00:51:38,655
As you very properly pointed out today,
a woman's life may depend on what we do.

767
00:51:38,728 --> 00:51:41,390
I'm sorry.
Do you want me to leave?

768
00:51:41,465 --> 00:51:43,831
Maybe that would be best, yes.

769
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:45,834
Oh, all right.

770
00:51:48,238 --> 00:51:52,504
I only thought if DC happened to wake up
and find a strange man in the bedroom...

771
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:56,409
I just don't know
how he's gonna take it.

772
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:59,107
Uh, you've got a point there.

773
00:52:00,317 --> 00:52:03,775
- Graham, are you settled in?
- Opposite the west end of the alley.

774
00:52:03,854 --> 00:52:06,322
If the informant goes west,
you've got him.

775
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:09,825
If he goes the other way, stand by.
I'll give you a new position.

776
00:52:10,894 --> 00:52:13,226
- Who's the square red one?
- The informant.

777
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:15,287
- The informant?
- Yeah.

778
00:52:15,365 --> 00:52:17,765
Oh, DC. Oh.

779
00:52:17,834 --> 00:52:20,667
Say, are you sure he
always goes out at 9:00?

780
00:52:20,737 --> 00:52:22,398
Oh, yes.

781
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:25,464
Unless, of course,
it's one of his contrary nights.

782
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:01,743
All agents now stand by.

783
00:53:05,148 --> 00:53:07,878
- For goodness sake, act casual.
- What?

784
00:53:07,951 --> 00:53:11,409
Don't let him suspect
anything's going on.

785
00:53:12,055 --> 00:53:14,046
Oh, oh.

786
00:53:15,625 --> 00:53:17,991
Nice kitty cat.

787
00:53:18,061 --> 00:53:20,495
Good old kitty cat.

788
00:53:20,564 --> 00:53:23,829
You can save the hypocrisy.

789
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:27,336
- He knows you don't like him.
- Oh.

790
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:09,306
You're all tensed up.
He's getting the idea something's wrong.

791
00:54:09,379 --> 00:54:11,847
Can't you act casual?

792
00:54:14,384 --> 00:54:17,319
Well, certainly nice weather
we're having, isn't it?

793
00:54:17,387 --> 00:54:20,015
And there's a bit of a wind
coming up from the east.

794
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:23,116
That's terrible.
Can't you do any better?

795
00:54:23,193 --> 00:54:26,492
- Well...
- And be careful what you say.

796
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:33,964
He can't understand
what I'm saying, can he?

797
00:54:34,037 --> 00:54:37,268
Not everything, of course.
He's just a cat.

798
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:39,604
But mostly everything.

799
00:54:45,382 --> 00:54:48,180
I told you before,
let my stuff alone.

800
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:52,944
And come on
in the house, snoopy.

801
00:54:55,225 --> 00:54:57,819
- I thought he's supposed to go out.
- Shh.

802
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,285
Spires, he's on his way.

803
00:55:32,595 --> 00:55:34,654
I have the informant in sight.

804
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:38,634
He's turning west on the alley,
toward Whittier Drive.

805
00:55:38,702 --> 00:55:42,331
Graham, he's coming your way.
Can you pick him up?

806
00:55:45,075 --> 00:55:46,702
I've got him.

807
00:55:50,246 --> 00:55:53,340
He's in the backyard of the
next-to-last house on Maple.

808
00:55:53,416 --> 00:55:54,849
I'm going to investigate.

809
00:55:58,221 --> 00:56:00,917
Spires and Cahill,
the informant is moving north.

810
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:02,719
Stand by for new positions.

811
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:09,863
He's looking up
at the side windows of the house.

812
00:56:09,933 --> 00:56:11,798
- Who lives here?
- The Hendersons.

813
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:15,360
- They moved in last winter.
- Forget it. He's moving to the street.

814
00:56:15,438 --> 00:56:18,737
Kelly, next-to-last house on Maple,
informant coming through.

815
00:56:18,808 --> 00:56:21,504
I make him, Control.
He's on Maple Street,

816
00:56:21,578 --> 00:56:23,739
bearing toward the business area.

817
00:56:24,647 --> 00:56:27,810
All right, Kelly,
leave the car and follow on foot.

818
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:31,183
Spires, move to the junction
of Whittier and College.

819
00:56:31,254 --> 00:56:35,247
The informant is approaching
the junction of Whittier and State.

820
00:56:36,593 --> 00:56:40,825
Okay, Graham,
move to Seventh and State.

821
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:42,660
Junction Seventh and State.

822
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:45,633
The informant has now
turned west onto State Street.

823
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:50,566
Cahill, move to Eighth Street,
about a half block south of Main.

824
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:54,667
The informant is moving down the alley
leading from State Street to Main.

825
00:57:14,998 --> 00:57:18,593
The informant is stopped on Main Street
in front of a delicatessen.

826
00:57:18,668 --> 00:57:20,602
That's Mr. Bartel's delicatessen.

827
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:24,162
DC always hangs around there and
it drives Mr. Bartel out of his mind.

828
00:57:29,379 --> 00:57:31,677
Get out of here.

829
00:57:33,383 --> 00:57:36,819
Informant's moving, crossing
to the south side of the street.

830
00:57:36,886 --> 00:57:40,322
Stay put for a minute, Kelly.
Graham, move to Seventh and Main.

831
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:42,654
Cahill, had a visual
on the informant yet?

832
00:57:42,725 --> 00:57:46,024
Have him, Control.
He's approaching my position.

833
00:58:03,213 --> 00:58:07,343
Informant passed my position, proceeding
toward the middle of the block.

834
00:58:14,757 --> 00:58:18,659
Informant has gone into the side yard
of an apartment building.

835
00:58:18,728 --> 00:58:20,127
Stick with him.

836
00:58:22,932 --> 00:58:26,026
- Does DC know anybody on Eighth?
- Who knows?

837
00:58:37,814 --> 00:58:42,308
He's still in the yard. He's interested
in something on the second floor.

838
00:58:42,385 --> 00:58:45,115
Let's start
pulling in our perimeter.

839
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:49,318
Kelly, move down Eighth to the building.
Cahill, stay with the informant.

840
00:58:49,392 --> 00:58:52,919
Graham, cut through the backyards
and come behind the apartment.

841
00:58:52,996 --> 00:58:55,487
- DC won't be hurt?
- I have to ask you to be quiet.

842
00:58:55,565 --> 00:58:59,831
Spires, start your car and move towards
the location with your lights off.

843
00:59:09,445 --> 00:59:11,037
Back away from that window.

844
00:59:11,114 --> 00:59:15,278
Why don't you let her stick her head out
the window and yell for help, meathead!

845
00:59:15,351 --> 00:59:16,340
What'd I do?

846
00:59:22,458 --> 00:59:25,154
Hold everything.
Informant's on the move again.

847
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:28,686
He's proceeding north on Eighth Street
the way he came in.

848
00:59:28,765 --> 00:59:30,824
Oh, no.

849
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:34,392
Cahill, stay with the informant.
Others return to positions.

850
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:36,529
I thought we had something there.
