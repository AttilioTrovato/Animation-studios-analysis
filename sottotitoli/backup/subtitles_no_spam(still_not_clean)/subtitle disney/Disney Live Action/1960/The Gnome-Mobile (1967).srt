00:11:18,045 --> 00:11:19,778

171
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,813
NO PEACE AT ALL.
NO PEACE AT ALL.

172
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:32,424
MY MIND'S MADE UP.

OH, YOU DIDN'T.

176
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:43,001

TO SEE A GNOME.

177
00:11:43,003 --> 00:11:46,004
OH, NOT REALLY.
I WAS JUST THINKING

178
00:11:46,006 --> 00:11:49,140
WHAT A LOVELY PLACE
THIS IS FOR GNOMES.

179
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:51,376
ARE THERE MANY OF YOU
LIVING HERE?

180
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:53,211
WELL,
THAT'S MY PROBLEM.

181
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,746
IF IT WEREN'T FOR THAT,

182
00:11:54,748 --> 00:11:57,382
I WOULDN'T BE SHOWIN' MYSELF
TO A DOO-DEEN.

183

THAT'S WHAT WE CALL
YOU BIG PEOPLE.

00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:04,489
AM I THE FIRST DOO-DEEN
YOU'VE EVER SPOKEN TO?

186
00:12:04,491 --> 00:12:06,091
YEAH, YEAH.

ADVISED AGAINST IT,

188
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:10,762
BUT I HAD TO TALK
TO<i> SOMEONE!</i>

189
00:12:10,764 --> 00:12:13,231
IF I'M THE FIRST DOO-DEEN
YOU'VE EVER SPOKEN TO,

190
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,300
HOW SHOULD YOU SPEAK
SUCH GOOD ENGLISH?

YOU DON'T REALLY BELIEVE
IN THAT SILLY STUFF,

201
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:44,162
DO YOU, GRANDFATHER?

202
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:46,064
THERE'S STILL
NO PEANUT BUTTER.

203
00:12:46,066 --> 00:12:48,233
OH, THEY PROBABLY
GOT THE LABELS MIXED.

204
00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:51,269
GRANDFATHER, COME QUICKLY!
I PROMISED HIM WE'D BE BACK!

205
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:52,504

TO TALK TO YOU!

212
00:13:05,152 --> 00:13:07,385
BUT WHY ME?
BECAUSE I TOLD HIM

213
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:11,122

WITH HIS PROBLEM, IT WAS YOU!

215
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:14,559
WELL, COME ON, RODNEY.

216
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:17,228

AND BUCKLES ON HIS SHOES?

I DIDN'T<i> SAY</i>
HE WAS A LEPRECHAUN!

225

HE SAID HE WAS A GNOME!

226
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:37,115
OH, A GNOME!
WELL, THAT'S DIFFERENT!

227
00:13:37,117 --> 00:13:41,386
THAT'S THE PLACE!
I'M HERE -- I'VE BROUGHT HIM!

228

00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:03,208
BUT HOW ABOUT HIM?

240
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:08,546
YOU EVER SEEN
A FIERCER-LOOKIN' CRITTER?

ABOUT THE EYES.

JASPER! JASPER!

244
00:14:14,487 --> 00:14:16,554
MAYBE THIS IS
THE WRONG PLACE.

I<i> DIDN'T</i> IMAGINE HIM!
I<i> DID</i> SEE HIM!

A GNOME, DARLING,

They're makin' her into a fool,
and all on account of me!
