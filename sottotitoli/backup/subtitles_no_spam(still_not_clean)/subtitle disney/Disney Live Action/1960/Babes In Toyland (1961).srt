00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:49,590
Hello, everybody.

2
00:01:49,658 --> 00:01:53,261
My name is Sylvester, Sylvester J. Goose.

3
00:01:53,329 --> 00:01:57,099
My friends call me Syl, or sometimes Silly.

4
00:01:58,836 --> 00:02:02,205
At this time, it is with unmitigated pleasure...

5
00:02:02,273 --> 00:02:03,841
Sylvester, talk faster.

6
00:02:03,909 --> 00:02:05,342
Talk faster?

7
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:08,046
You're lucky to find a goose who can talk at all.

8
00:02:08,113 --> 00:02:12,316
As I was saying, it is my pleasure to present

9
00:02:12,384 --> 00:02:17,023
your hostess for this occasion, weighing 189 pounds...

10
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:18,491
Sylvester!

11
00:02:19,794 --> 00:02:23,730
I present the one and only Mother Goose.

12
00:02:27,903 --> 00:02:29,638
Thank you, Sylvester.

13
00:02:29,706 --> 00:02:31,941
Blabbermouth.

14
00:02:32,008 --> 00:02:35,946
I'm here to invite you to a celebration in our village.

15
00:02:36,013 --> 00:02:39,349
Tomorrow is the wedding of Tom and Mary.

16
00:02:39,417 --> 00:02:41,185
2 of my closest friends.

17
00:02:41,253 --> 00:02:42,553
I know.

18
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:47,492
So put on your best smile, set free your imagination,

19
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,962
and come with us to Mother Goose Village.

20
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,332

Fah!

82
00:09:17,686 --> 00:09:22,057
You see, unbeknownst to Mary, she inherits scads of money

83
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:23,342
when she marries.

84
00:09:23,409 --> 00:09:26,914
Thus it carries, that if I'm to get my hands on Mary's money,

85
00:09:26,981 --> 00:09:30,566
the person Mary marries must be me.
Not Tom, me.

86
00:09:30,634 --> 00:09:33,237
I must do away with Tom.

87
00:09:33,305 --> 00:09:34,689
Gonzorgo!

88
00:09:34,757 --> 00:09:36,190
Rodrigo!

89
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:38,928
Come, let us plot.

90
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:41,013
Ow!

91
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,282
Idiots!

92
00:10:02,673 --> 00:10:06,677
Now, gentlemen, it is said you'll do anything for money.

93
00:10:06,745 --> 00:10:09,312
You see, your infamous reputation is widespread.

94
00:10:09,314 --> 00:10:11,132
Oh, thank you, Mr. Barnaby.

95
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,269
Now make note while I plan this little caper.

96
00:10:16,539 --> 00:10:17,706
Mark this down.

97
00:10:17,774 --> 00:10:19,374
Mark this down.

98
00:10:19,442 --> 00:10:23,146
Item one... item one... Kidnap Tom.

99
00:10:23,214 --> 00:10:26,049
Kidnap Tom.

100
00:10:26,117 --> 00:10:29,720
No, no, kidnap him.

101
00:10:29,788 --> 00:10:32,925
Item 2... Item 2...

102
00:10:34,327 --> 00:10:35,727
Throw him in the sea.

103
00:10:35,795 --> 00:10:38,264
Throw him in the sea.

104
00:10:38,332 --> 00:10:41,600
No, no, just throw him in the sea.

105
00:10:41,668 --> 00:10:47,574
Item 3... item 3... Mary's sheep. Hmm.

106
00:10:47,642 --> 00:10:49,144
These sheep support her.

107
00:10:49,212 --> 00:10:51,213
Somehow I must thwart her.

108
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,181
She's much too independent with them.

109
00:10:53,249 --> 00:10:55,017
Therefore, she must be without them.

110
00:10:58,438 --> 00:11:00,106
Steal the sheep.

111
00:11:00,174 --> 00:11:01,875
Steal the sheep.

112
00:11:06,482 --> 00:11:09,183
No, steal them.

113
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:12,321
A-a-anything else, Mr. Barnaby?

114
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:14,256
That's all for now, gentlemen, and, uh,

115
00:11:14,324 --> 00:11:18,961
when this deed is through, this tidy stipend is for you.

116
00:11:20,431 --> 00:11:22,633
A pittance. Preposterous.

117
00:11:22,701 --> 00:11:24,769
This experience should make us wiser.

118
00:11:24,836 --> 00:11:27,104
We do not do business with a miser.

119
00:11:32,345 --> 00:11:33,646
Come, Rodrigo.

120
00:11:33,714 --> 00:11:35,581
We are wasting our time.

121
00:11:59,644 --> 00:12:02,246
Behold, my mercenary friends.

122
00:12:02,314 --> 00:12:04,349
Does this satisfy your greed?

123
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:05,916
Oh, indeed it does.

124
00:12:05,986 --> 00:12:07,752
Indeed it does.

125
00:12:12,943 --> 00:12:16,913

235

I've heard it said that gypsies buy babies.

236
00:21:29,366 --> 00:21:30,850
I wonder if they'd be interested

237
00:21:30,917 --> 00:21:32,819

Rodrigo, I have an idea.

239
00:21:41,063 --> 00:21:42,931
Why don't we sell Tom to the gypsies,

240
00:21:42,999 --> 00:21:45,701
and that way, collect for him twice, understand?

241
00:21:48,773 --> 00:21:52,408
Listen, Barnaby is paying us to get rid of Tom.

242
00:21:52,476 --> 00:21:55,012
But if, instead of throwing Tom into the sea,

243
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,348
we sell him to the gypsies, we'll be paid for him again.

244

Once by Barnaby and once by the gypsies.

Oh, now Mary, don't be funny.

263
00:23:10,302 --> 00:23:11,903
Well, it could happen, you know.

264
00:23:11,971 --> 00:23:14,472
A friend of mine was get... Hush, Sylvester.

265
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,974
I hadn't finished.

266
00:23:16,042 --> 00:23:17,176
Sorry.

267
00:23:17,244 --> 00:23:18,744
Hand me a pin, Sylvester.

268
00:23:21,881 --> 00:23:23,450
Thank you.

269
00:23:23,517 --> 00:23:25,785
Now, let's see.

270
00:23:25,853 --> 00:23:29,057
There's something borrowed, something blue.

271
00:23:29,124 --> 00:23:30,058
Uh-oh.

272
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:32,760
Good day, friends.

273
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:35,197
And here's something old and ugly, too.

274
00:23:35,265 --> 00:23:38,969
Ah, what a charming bride.

275
00:23:39,036 --> 00:23:41,771
The sweetest and the loveliest I have ever seen.

276
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:45,276
Why, that oily... Hush, Sylvester.

277
00:23:45,344 --> 00:23:47,345
Thank you, Mr. Barnaby.

278
00:23:47,412 --> 00:23:49,413
May I offer you my best wishes

279
00:23:49,481 --> 00:23:51,249
for your future happiness and joy?

280
00:23:51,317 --> 00:23:53,685
You miserable, miserly... Sylvester, no.

281
00:23:56,656 --> 00:23:59,993
For lunch, I had roast goose!

282
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:00,960
Aah!

283
00:24:02,998 --> 00:24:05,132
That's the way we lost mother.

284
00:24:08,871 --> 00:24:10,472
Would you please excuse us?

285
00:24:10,539 --> 00:24:12,073
We have so much to do.

286
00:24:12,141 --> 00:24:13,376
Ah, yes, of course.

287
00:24:13,443 --> 00:24:16,612
The preparations for the wedding, and... Oh, what's that?

288
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:18,515
Come on!

289
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,384
Some small excitement.

290
00:24:27,792 --> 00:24:29,861
This is Mary's cottage, sir.

291
00:24:29,896 --> 00:24:32,163
Oh, thank you, my dear fellow.

292
00:24:32,232 --> 00:24:34,684
Rodrigo, take care of this lad.

293
00:24:37,471 --> 00:24:41,342
No, no, don't hit him, tip him.

294
00:24:45,882 --> 00:24:47,498
Oh, thank you.

295
00:24:50,886 --> 00:24:53,489
My word, 2 shipwrecked sailors.

296
00:24:53,557 --> 00:24:55,224
Sailors?

297
00:24:55,292 --> 00:24:57,728
Whatever are they doing here?

298
00:24:57,796 --> 00:25:00,664
I... I can't imagine.

299
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:02,333
Now remember, we are sup...

300
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:11,727
My friend and I would like to know,

301
00:25:11,778 --> 00:25:14,414
are you Miss Mary quite contrary?

302
00:25:14,482 --> 00:25:16,516
Yes, sir, I am she.

303
00:25:16,584 --> 00:25:17,951
Well, uh...

304
00:25:19,955 --> 00:25:23,624
We don't know how to tell you this, Miss Mary.

305
00:25:23,692 --> 00:25:27,846
No, we don't know how to tell you this at all.

306
00:25:27,913 --> 00:25:30,216
We were 20 leagues at sea.

307
00:25:30,283 --> 00:25:33,886
It was calm as it could be, when out of the north,

308
00:25:33,954 --> 00:25:35,505
there came a sudden squall.

309
00:25:36,808 --> 00:25:40,061
He was standing at the wheel, he was, Miss Mary,

310
00:25:40,128 --> 00:25:44,382
and across the deck, the mighty ocean roared.

311
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:48,420
Then the mizzen broke and fell, and we heard the fellow yell

312
00:25:48,488 --> 00:25:52,626

and in his hat we found this soggy note.

332
00:26:51,796 --> 00:26:56,050
Though the salty ocean spray somehow washed the words away,

333
00:26:56,118 --> 00:26:58,971
I'll see if I can't decipher what he wrote.

334
00:27:00,439 --> 00:27:04,477
"Darling Mary", he begins, or is that "dearest"?

335

Yes, that's the term he uses, we agree.

Come, children, in the house.

367
00:29:00,865 --> 00:29:03,234
There's something fishy about this!

368
00:29:03,301 --> 00:29:04,502
Hush, Sylvester.

369
00:29:04,569 --> 00:29:06,571
Well, I wouldn't trust either one of them.

370
00:29:06,639 --> 00:29:08,473
The fat one or the idiot.

371
00:29:08,541 --> 00:29:09,907
Well done, boys.

372
00:29:09,975 --> 00:29:11,744
Now for item 3.

373
00:29:11,811 --> 00:29:13,546
Item 3, steal the sheep.

374
00:29:13,614 --> 00:29:15,148
On your way.

375
00:29:21,155 --> 00:29:25,160
Gentle Mary, so grief-stricken and remorseful.

376
00:29:25,227 --> 00:29:28,280
Oh, to see you thus is more than I can bear.

377
00:29:28,348 --> 00:29:30,232
Erase your sorrow now.

378
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,885
Be resourceful for yourself

379
00:29:32,952 --> 00:29:35,154
and those poor children in your care.

380
00:29:36,323 --> 00:29:39,293
Take advantage, my dear, of my infatuation!

381
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:43,748
May I point out you are deeply in my debt?

382
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:47,052
I could seize your home through legal confiscation!

383
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,739
Oh, I do hope you don't take that as a threat.

384
00:29:50,807 --> 00:29:54,143
Feast your eyes upon my mansion, tall and stately,

385
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:57,347
and imagine it a castle, dear, in Spain.

386
00:29:57,415 --> 00:29:59,316
Come, my love.

387
00:29:59,384 --> 00:30:01,285
For I'd admire it greatly

388
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:05,056

You do?

00:37:22,706 --> 00:37:24,323

Mary! Mary!

762
00:57:00,794 --> 00:57:02,429
Thank goodness you're safe!

763
00:57:02,497 --> 00:57:05,265
We were so worried about you.

764
00:57:05,333 --> 00:57:07,268
And look who's here.

765
00:57:07,336 --> 00:57:08,519
Tom!

766
00:57:08,587 --> 00:57:10,020
Hello, Willie.

767
00:57:10,088 --> 00:57:11,657
Tom, you're back!

768
00:57:11,725 --> 00:57:14,292
Tom! Tom, you're back!

769
00:57:14,361 --> 00:57:16,628
Tom, you didn't drown!

770
00:57:16,696 --> 00:57:18,631
No, no, I'm fine, just fine.

771
00:57:18,699 --> 00:57:20,533
But how are you? Are you all right?

772
00:57:20,601 --> 00:57:22,470
Yes, we're all right.

773
00:57:22,537 --> 00:57:24,304
But we didn't find the sheep.

774
00:57:24,373 --> 00:57:26,206
We'll find the sheep later.

775
00:57:26,274 --> 00:57:29,143
But right now we're going to take you home.

776
00:57:29,211 --> 00:57:32,381
No, Mary, I think it's too dark to travel any more tonight.

777
00:57:32,448 --> 00:57:34,717
I think we should settle down right here for the evening,

778
00:57:34,785 --> 00:57:37,520
till morning, anyway, then we'll look for the sheep.

779
00:57:37,588 --> 00:57:39,723
Oh, we can't leave anyway. We're captured.

780
00:57:41,092 --> 00:57:42,626
You're what?

781
00:57:42,694 --> 00:57:43,727
We're captured.

782
00:57:43,795 --> 00:57:44,729
Yeah.

783
00:57:44,797 --> 00:57:46,230
The trees captured us.

784
00:57:46,298 --> 00:57:47,999
The trees captured you?

785
00:57:48,066 --> 00:57:49,267
What trees?

786
00:57:49,334 --> 00:57:50,903
All these trees.

787
00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:53,773
Oh, they're all right. They're just a little tired.

788
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:56,009
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

789
00:57:56,076 --> 00:57:58,445
The trees captured you.

790
00:57:58,513 --> 00:58:00,947
All right. Let's look for a nice spot to settle down

791
00:58:01,015 --> 00:58:03,084

Yes, look.

890
01:03:25,381 --> 01:03:26,799
"Closed for alterations."

891
01:03:27,951 --> 01:03:29,285

01:03:29,370 --> 01:03:30,487
Come on!

01:03:35,276 --> 01:03:37,511

01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:44,052
Hmm. Looks like Toyland has been deserted.

895
01:03:44,119 --> 01:03:45,454
Mr. Toy Maker.

896
01:03:45,522 --> 01:03:46,889
It came from over there.

897
01:03:46,957 --> 01:03:49,792
Oh, Mr. Toy Maker, it's all ready, sir.

898
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:52,462
For goodness sake, Grumio, you know I'm busy!

899
01:03:52,530 --> 01:03:53,797
But there's something I...

900
01:03:53,865 --> 01:03:55,933
Listen, I'm working on a new invention.

901
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,436
This is fantastic.

902
01:04:01,206 --> 01:04:02,557
What... what is it?

903
01:04:02,625 --> 01:04:04,460
What is it?

904
01:04:04,527 --> 01:04:06,261
I'll tell you what it is.

905
01:04:06,329 --> 01:04:10,467
What is the first thing a boy does when he gets a new toy?

906
01:04:10,534 --> 01:04:11,701
Well, I... I'll tell ya.

907
01:04:11,768 --> 01:04:13,770
He takes it apart to see how it works.

908
01:04:13,838 --> 01:04:16,007
But with my invention, he doesn't have to do that.

909
01:04:16,074 --> 01:04:17,475
The toy is already broken.

910
01:04:17,542 --> 01:04:20,812
I made that up myself, you know, in the other room there.

911
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:23,465
Mr. Toy Maker... Oh, was there something you wanted?

912
01:04:23,533 --> 01:04:25,468
Yes, there's something I want to show you, sir.

913
01:04:25,536 --> 01:04:27,069
Please, please come with me. Please.

914
01:04:33,361 --> 01:04:35,463
This is my new invention.

915
01:04:50,732 --> 01:04:52,166

916
01:04:52,234 --> 01:04:53,968
Yes, sir.

917
01:04:58,424 --> 01:05:00,342
How do you like it, sir?

918
01:05:00,410 --> 01:05:02,344
Oh, fine, fine. It's awful nice.

919
01:05:02,412 --> 01:05:04,947
Very nice. You do very good work, Grumio.

920
01:05:05,015 --> 01:05:06,549
Very good. Beautiful.

921
01:05:06,617 --> 01:05:07,950
Oh, just a minute, sir.

922
01:05:08,018 --> 01:05:09,953
Don't you want to see how it works?

923
01:05:10,021 --> 01:05:11,389
How what works?

924
01:05:11,456 --> 01:05:12,956
My invention!

925
01:05:13,024 --> 01:05:14,459
This does something?

926
01:05:14,527 --> 01:05:16,645
Oh, yes, sir. It certainly does!

927
01:05:16,696 --> 01:05:18,013
It makes toys.

928
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:19,398
It does?

929
01:05:19,466 --> 01:05:21,134
This is my new toy making machine.

930
01:05:21,202 --> 01:05:23,419
You'll never ever need these hand tools again, sir.

931
01:05:23,487 --> 01:05:25,973
This is the latest concept in automation!

932
01:05:26,041 --> 01:05:27,842
Here, let me explain.

933
01:05:27,909 --> 01:05:29,676
Let's say we wanna make a doll.

934
01:05:29,744 --> 01:05:31,479
Let's.

935
01:05:31,547 --> 01:05:33,565
Now, first we have to diagram the problem

936
01:05:33,632 --> 01:05:36,685
for the machine on the occiligraph, you understand?

937
01:05:36,753 --> 01:05:38,420
Just make a doll. That's all.

938
01:05:38,488 --> 01:05:40,039
Make a doll. Yes, sir.

939
01:05:40,106 --> 01:05:41,708
Now we select the ingredients.

940
01:05:41,776 --> 01:05:47,532
Uh... blue eyes, blonde hair, smiling lips.

941
01:05:47,583 --> 01:05:50,601
Oh, and suppose you want to make it a girl doll...

942
01:05:50,669 --> 01:05:54,923
Um... sugar... and spice... Everything nice.

943
01:05:56,859 --> 01:06:01,214
One doll, demonstration purposes at slow speed.

944
01:06:01,282 --> 01:06:03,383
And now, automation takes over!

945
01:06:03,450 --> 01:06:05,219
Is that so?

946
01:06:05,287 --> 01:06:06,270
Look!

947
01:06:06,388 --> 01:06:08,488
Oh, that's wonderful!

948
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:34,036
This is astonishing!

949
01:06:34,104 --> 01:06:36,506
Simply astonishing!

950
01:06:36,573 --> 01:06:38,759
A real doll!

951
01:06:38,826 --> 01:06:41,744
Grumio, this is amazing!

952
01:06:41,813 --> 01:06:44,748
Oh... thank you, sir.

953
01:06:44,817 --> 01:06:46,750
Can this machine make a toy boat, too?

954
01:06:46,819 --> 01:06:48,620
Toy boat coming up, sir.

955
01:06:50,974 --> 01:06:53,392
Now I'll make a boat.

956
01:06:55,046 --> 01:07:00,868
Uh... hull, decks, smoke stacks, lifeboats...

957
01:07:03,121 --> 01:07:06,542
And we'll need, uh... There's a mast and a poop deck...

958
01:07:06,576 --> 01:07:07,709
Stop mumbling.

959
01:07:07,794 --> 01:07:09,227
Make the boat. Make the boat.

960
01:07:09,295 --> 01:07:12,348
We'll run this one at, uh... medium speed,

961
01:07:12,416 --> 01:07:15,485
and once more, automation reigns supreme!

962
01:07:35,276 --> 01:07:37,727
This is overwhelming!

963
01:07:37,796 --> 01:07:39,597
A doll! A boat!

964
01:07:39,664 --> 01:07:41,916
Oh, my machine can make anything, sir!

965
01:07:41,983 --> 01:07:44,753
Grumio... You are a genius.

966
01:07:44,821 --> 01:07:46,922
Thank you, sir.

967
01:07:46,989 --> 01:07:49,258
And now, to work.

968
01:07:51,779 --> 01:07:53,880
And now, as we have a deadline to meet,

969
01:07:53,947 --> 01:07:56,333
I will start the machine at full production.

970
01:07:56,401 --> 01:07:57,685
Uh, just a moment, Grumio.

971
01:07:57,752 --> 01:07:58,952
You'll start the machine?

972
01:07:59,021 --> 01:08:00,455
Oh, no, you won't.

973
01:08:00,523 --> 01:08:02,524
I'm the head toy maker here.

974
01:08:02,592 --> 01:08:04,375
I'll start the machine in full production.

975
01:08:04,444 --> 01:08:06,195
You're just my assistant.

976
01:08:06,263 --> 01:08:07,730
Will you please step aside?

977
01:08:07,781 --> 01:08:09,732
If I need any help, I'll call you.

978
01:08:09,783 --> 01:08:11,401
Here. Hold these, please.

979
01:08:11,469 --> 01:08:13,470
If I want you, I'll call you, Grumio,

980
01:08:13,537 --> 01:08:15,088
or I'll call you assistant.

981
01:08:15,156 --> 01:08:17,375
It depends entirely on the mood I'm in.

982
01:08:17,442 --> 01:08:19,377
Now, let me see. We need some wagons,

983
01:08:19,444 --> 01:08:20,895
we need marbles, we need dolls.

984
01:08:20,963 --> 01:08:22,414
We could use some roller skates.

985
01:08:22,482 --> 01:08:24,065
Children love roller skates, you know.

986
01:08:24,133 --> 01:08:28,222
Some parcheesi sets... I think you're overloading it, sir.

987
01:08:28,289 --> 01:08:30,990
I think about 4 million each to start with.

988
01:08:31,058 --> 01:08:32,792
4 million?!

989
01:08:32,860 --> 01:08:35,129
And I think we'll start at super speed!

990
01:08:37,182 --> 01:08:38,382
Pick that up, assistant.

991
01:08:38,450 --> 01:08:40,235
Hoo hoo hoo!

992
01:08:40,303 --> 01:08:42,154
Oh, that's just remarkable!

993
01:08:42,221 --> 01:08:44,590
Ho ho ho, hoo hoo! My!

994
01:08:48,228 --> 01:08:49,395
Oh, my!

995
01:08:49,463 --> 01:08:50,681
What's this thing here?

996
01:08:50,748 --> 01:08:54,501
No, Mr. Toy Maker, please, get out of there, sir, please!

997
01:08:54,569 --> 01:08:55,971
Really remarkable.

998
01:08:56,038 --> 01:08:57,738
You're making it very difficult, sir.

999
01:08:57,806 --> 01:08:59,657
Please don't touch anything else!

1000
01:08:59,725 --> 01:09:01,593
Oh! This is wonderful!

1001
01:09:01,661 --> 01:09:05,064
Hoo hoo hoo! Hoo hoo... Stop that, Grumio!

1002
01:09:10,689 --> 01:09:12,440
It's real!

1003
01:09:12,508 --> 01:09:14,759
Oh! Hoo hoo hoo!

1004
01:09:16,345 --> 01:09:18,247
Oh, Grumio! This one's broken!

1005
01:09:18,315 --> 01:09:20,933
Get a little glue.

1006
01:09:21,001 --> 01:09:22,702
Hurry up! Oh...

1007
01:09:34,316 --> 01:09:36,768
There's something wrong, Grumio!

1008
01:09:36,836 --> 01:09:37,819
Grumio!

1009
01:09:39,722 --> 01:09:41,724
Do something fast!

1010
01:09:41,792 --> 01:09:44,110
There's something wrong here, Grumio.

1011
01:09:44,177 --> 01:09:46,113
Look!

1012
01:09:58,295 --> 01:09:59,912
I think something's wrong!

1013
01:10:04,385 --> 01:10:06,503
Stop that thing! Grumio!

1014
01:10:06,570 --> 01:10:08,022
Grumio, come here!

1015
01:10:08,089 --> 01:10:10,091
Grumio, look out!

1016
01:10:10,159 --> 01:10:11,492
Look out, Grumio!

1017
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:13,462
Look ooooout!

1018
01:10:18,117 --> 01:10:19,819
You know something?

1019
01:10:19,887 --> 01:10:21,754
I think we should go to lunch.

1020
01:10:50,807 --> 01:10:53,142
This is catastrophic!

1021
01:10:53,210 --> 01:10:54,811
My goodness!

1022
01:10:59,968 --> 01:11:01,851
I'm ruined!

1023
01:11:01,919 --> 01:11:03,721
Absolutely ruined!

1024
01:11:05,624 --> 01:11:06,858
Grumio.

1025
01:11:06,925 --> 01:11:08,309
Grumio!

1026
01:11:08,377 --> 01:11:10,245
Grumio!

1027
01:11:10,313 --> 01:11:12,865
Grumio!

1028
01:11:12,882 --> 01:11:17,337
Oh, there you are. You are alone responsible for everything...

1029
01:11:17,405 --> 01:11:19,556
Just you and you alone!

1030
01:11:19,608 --> 01:11:21,559
Did you say that your invention

1031
01:11:21,610 --> 01:11:24,912
was to make toys or to make noise?

1032
01:11:24,980 --> 01:11:27,098
Go! Get outta here!

1033
01:11:27,166 --> 01:11:29,117
Go on! Go to your room

1034
01:11:29,184 --> 01:11:31,487
and invent something to destroy yourself!

1035
01:11:31,554 --> 01:11:33,707
This is horrible!

1036
01:11:41,082 --> 01:11:43,852
I'll never make that Christmas deadline now.

1037
01:12:01,423 --> 01:12:04,910
My, my, this is... This is terrible!

1038
01:12:04,978 --> 01:12:06,311
Just awful.

1039
01:12:06,379 --> 01:12:08,280
I, uh, I beg your pardon, sir.

1040
01:12:08,347 --> 01:12:10,500
Why, who are you?

1041
01:12:12,503 --> 01:12:15,773
Well, my name's Tom Piper, and... What are you doing here?

1042
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:17,341
We came to see you.

1043
01:12:22,231 --> 01:12:23,581
Who are you?

1044
01:12:23,649 --> 01:12:25,100
She's my sister.

1045
01:12:26,820 --> 01:12:28,437
Well, you shouldn't be here!

1046
01:12:28,505 --> 01:12:30,272
Don't you know that it isn't right

1047
01:12:30,340 --> 01:12:33,727
for children to see these toys until Christmas day?

1048
01:12:33,795 --> 01:12:38,566
These... we... well, we... We had a lot of toys around here.

1049
01:12:38,634 --> 01:12:42,420
But you can see... Well...

1050
01:12:47,594 --> 01:12:52,633
This is the only toy in the whole factory that isn't broken.

1051
01:12:55,521 --> 01:12:57,972
We're really very sorry, Mr. Toy Maker.

1052
01:12:58,023 --> 01:12:59,808
Yeah, thank you.

1053
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:02,127
But what are you doing here?

1054
01:13:02,194 --> 01:13:04,229
We're arrested!

1055
01:13:04,296 --> 01:13:07,234
The trees said for us to report to you.

1056
01:13:07,301 --> 01:13:10,103
Well, naturally, you have to report to me.

1057
01:13:10,170 --> 01:13:14,742
I'm not only the head toy maker, I'm also the Mayor of Toyland

1058
01:13:14,809 --> 01:13:16,745
and the chief of police.

1059
01:13:16,812 --> 01:13:19,414
We noticed you have quite a problem, sir.

1060
01:13:22,052 --> 01:13:23,569
Yes. Quite a problem. Yes.

1061
01:13:23,637 --> 01:13:26,406
Well, is there anything we can do to help?

1062
01:13:36,585 --> 01:13:38,687
Half-past October.

1063
01:13:38,755 --> 01:13:40,589
The deadline near.

1064
01:13:40,657 --> 01:13:42,925
The children will have no Merry Christmas.

1065
01:13:42,993 --> 01:13:46,096
Mr. Toy Maker, we're strong, and we're willing to work.

1066
01:13:46,164 --> 01:13:48,098
I think we'd make a fine assembly line.

1067
01:13:48,166 --> 01:13:50,618
And we'd work day and night, wouldn't we, children?

1068
01:13:50,686 --> 01:13:51,552
Yes! Yes, sure!

1069
01:13:51,620 --> 01:13:54,121
Please, please let us help you.

1070
01:13:54,189 --> 01:13:56,342
You wanna work?

1071
01:13:56,409 --> 01:13:58,443
Nobody wants to work these days.

1072
01:13:58,511 --> 01:14:02,832
It's not automation, sir, but we've got our hands to use.

1073
01:14:02,899 --> 01:14:06,754
Well... Maybe I could try it. Ha.

1074
01:14:06,838 --> 01:14:09,106
What have I got to lose?

1075
01:14:09,224 --> 01:14:11,593
All right, folks. I'll put you to work.

1076
01:14:11,644 --> 01:14:13,911
I've been such a dope.

1077
01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:18,317
As long as there are people, we should never give up hope!

1078
01:14:18,385 --> 01:14:19,736
Yay! Yay!

1079
01:14:19,787 --> 01:14:22,673
First we have to clean up that assembly room.

1080
01:14:22,740 --> 01:14:25,225

Magnificent.

01:16:51,332 --> 01:16:53,950
Let's all wash up, and we'll have supper.

1137
01:16:54,018 --> 01:16:56,237
Then early to bed, kids, so we'll be

Thanks to you children.

I like making toys.

1155

You can make them, but you mustn't keep them.

Mr. Toymaker! Where's Mr. Toymaker?!

1197
01:21:07,317 --> 01:21:08,651
He's in his room asleep.

1198
01:21:08,718 --> 01:21:09,885
I've got to show him something.

1199
01:21:09,953 --> 01:21:12,688
I've got to show him my new invention!

1200
01:21:17,078 --> 01:21:19,780
Mr. Toymaker, Mr. Toymaker, please, wake up, sir.

1201
01:21:21,984 --> 01:21:23,684
Don't shoot me! Don't shoot me!

1202
01:21:23,752 --> 01:21:25,387
Just a minute, sir. Please, wake up.

1203
01:21:25,455 --> 01:21:27,023
This is my new invention.

1204
01:21:27,090 --> 01:21:28,124
What?

1205
01:21:28,191 --> 01:21:30,093
My new invention.

1206
01:21:30,161 --> 01:21:32,695
This is another one of your inventions?

1207
01:21:32,763 --> 01:21:34,264
Yes. Shoot me.

1208
01:21:34,332 --> 01:21:35,899
Oh, please, sir. Wait a minute.

1209
01:21:35,967 --> 01:21:38,136
This is my... this is a scientific triumph.

1210
01:21:38,203 --> 01:21:39,720
It's a biochemical breakthrough.

1211
01:21:39,788 --> 01:21:41,990
Sir, please, my new formula for toy-making

1212
01:21:42,058 --> 01:21:43,758
is even better than automation!

1213
01:21:43,826 --> 01:21:45,427
It's better? Yes.

1214
01:21:45,495 --> 01:21:46,529
Good night.

1215
01:21:46,597 --> 01:21:47,830
Oh, please, sir, please, please.

1216
01:21:47,898 --> 01:21:49,732
Let me demonstrate this. This really works.

1217
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:52,169
Get back, get back. Please, get back.

1218
01:21:52,237 --> 01:21:54,171
This is very, very dangerous.

1219
01:21:54,239 --> 01:21:55,639
Watch closely, sir.

1220
01:21:55,707 --> 01:21:57,676
Big chair...

1221
01:22:07,521 --> 01:22:08,522
Toy chair.

1222
01:22:10,291 --> 01:22:11,992
Poof. Just like that?

1223
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:13,560
Just like that.

1224
01:22:16,031 --> 01:22:17,431
A big table...

1225
01:22:26,727 --> 01:22:27,727
Toy table.

1226
01:22:27,762 --> 01:22:30,029
This is provocative! Give me that thing.

1227
01:22:30,097 --> 01:22:32,633
Oh, careful, sir. This is a very dangerous compound.

1228
01:22:32,701 --> 01:22:37,289
2 molecular discharges will result in complete obliteration.

1229
01:22:37,357 --> 01:22:38,907
Observe.

1230
01:22:46,767 --> 01:22:49,403
Very interesting.

1231
01:22:49,471 --> 01:22:50,737
Oh, I see.

1232
01:22:50,805 --> 01:22:52,574
Poof, but not poof poof.

1233
01:22:52,642 --> 01:22:53,708
That's correct.

1234
01:22:53,776 --> 01:22:55,243
Let me poof that thing.

1235
01:22:55,311 --> 01:22:57,345
Oh, no, sir, no, no, you mustn't, sir.

1236
01:22:57,413 --> 01:23:00,083
One thing you must and should remember:

1237
01:23:00,150 --> 01:23:01,784
I am the head Toymaker.

1238
01:23:01,852 --> 01:23:03,286
You're just my assistant.

1239
01:23:03,353 --> 01:23:04,754
Mr. Toymaker, maybe you shouldn't.

1240
01:23:04,822 --> 01:23:07,324
That's a very dangerous... Have you seen our new invention?

1241
01:23:07,392 --> 01:23:08,659
Don't aim it at them, sir.

1242
01:23:08,726 --> 01:23:10,095
Oh, wait'll you see it make toys.

1243
01:23:10,162 --> 01:23:11,963
It makes wonderful... But it's very dangerous.

1244
01:23:12,031 --> 01:23:14,332
You'll have to stand back, please. Stand back there.

1245
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:15,902
Stand back a little.

1246
01:23:15,969 --> 01:23:17,636
Big desk...

1247
01:23:23,511 --> 01:23:24,711
Toy desk.

1248
01:23:25,881 --> 01:23:28,882
Now I'm gonna show you... Oh, please, don't point that, sir.

1249
01:23:28,950 --> 01:23:31,319
Well, wait till you see what I'm gonna do now.

1250
01:23:31,387 --> 01:23:32,921
Big bed...

1251
01:23:37,194 --> 01:23:38,261
Toy bed.

1252
01:23:38,329 --> 01:23:39,829
Oh!

1253
01:23:39,897 --> 01:23:42,181
This is simply wonderful!

1254
01:23:42,249 --> 01:23:45,586
Now I can make thousands of toys at one time.

1255
01:23:45,654 --> 01:23:49,274
Grumio, you are a genius.

1256
01:23:49,342 --> 01:23:50,925
Tommy!

1257
01:23:50,993 --> 01:23:53,730
Mr. Toymaker... Listen to me, Tommy.

1258
01:23:53,797 --> 01:23:55,765
Isn't this a wonderful way to make toys?

1259
01:23:55,833 --> 01:23:56,899
Yes, sir, it is.

1260
01:23:56,967 --> 01:23:59,336
It's a wonderful invention, sir, but...

1261
01:23:59,403 --> 01:24:02,272
Where are you going to get the big things

1262
01:24:02,340 --> 01:24:04,591
to reduce to small things?

1263
01:24:10,917 --> 01:24:13,151
Where are we gonna get the big things

1264
01:24:13,219 --> 01:24:15,371
to reduce to small things?

1265
01:24:15,438 --> 01:24:16,573
Good question, sir.

1266
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:17,674
I think so.

1267
01:24:17,725 --> 01:24:20,026
Well, I think we could always, uh...

1268
01:24:24,716 --> 01:24:26,484
I don't know.

1269
01:24:26,551 --> 01:24:29,488
You are a nutwit.

1270
01:24:29,555 --> 01:24:31,423
You and your stupid inventions.

1271
01:24:31,491 --> 01:24:33,943
Go! Go to your room!

1272
01:24:34,011 --> 01:24:35,561
Instantly!

1273
01:24:40,218 --> 01:24:42,052
Silly invention.

1274
01:24:42,087 --> 01:24:44,539
I knew it wouldn't be any good the moment I saw it.

1275
01:24:44,607 --> 01:24:47,992
Whoever called you a genius?

1276
01:24:48,060 --> 01:24:49,895
Poof on this poof gun!

1277
01:24:52,466 --> 01:24:55,019
I think I can use this poof gun.

1278
01:25:00,226 --> 01:25:02,794
You and your nutty ideas.

1279
01:25:02,862 --> 01:25:04,896
Waking me up in the middle of the night

1280
01:25:04,964 --> 01:25:06,799
when all I wanted was a little sleep.

1281
01:25:10,704 --> 01:25:12,673
My goodness.

1282
01:25:12,740 --> 01:25:15,341
This is only good if my foot's asleep.

1283
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:26,087
What happened here?

1284
01:25:26,156 --> 01:25:28,307
I'll show you what happened.

1285
01:25:42,958 --> 01:25:44,827
Must be me.

1286
01:25:44,894 --> 01:25:48,614
That grumio's got me so confused.

1287
01:25:48,681 --> 01:25:49,798
It's terrible.

1288
01:25:49,866 --> 01:25:52,035
I need sleep so much.

1289
01:25:52,103 --> 01:25:54,971
My goodness. Grumio.

1290
01:26:05,918 --> 01:26:06,986
Who are you?!

1291
01:26:09,423 --> 01:26:11,390
Tom! Mary!

1292
01:26:11,458 --> 01:26:13,310
Who are you?!

1293
01:26:13,361 --> 01:26:14,529
Get out of here!

1294
01:26:14,596 --> 01:26:17,014
Come, little one.

1295
01:26:17,082 --> 01:26:21,436
Do you realize that gun has reduced a human being?

1296
01:26:21,504 --> 01:26:23,656
Tom! Mary!

1297
01:26:23,724 --> 01:26:25,007
Get out of here!

1298
01:26:25,075 --> 01:26:27,026
What's going on here?! Put me down!

1299
01:26:27,094 --> 01:26:29,563
Let me down, you monster, you ogre!

1300
01:26:29,631 --> 01:26:31,098
There, there, little fellow.

1301
01:26:31,165 --> 01:26:32,766
No harm will befall you.

1302
01:26:32,834 --> 01:26:35,971
Fact is, I'm going to need you.

1303
01:26:36,038 --> 01:26:37,806
I want to go to sleep!

1304
01:26:37,873 --> 01:26:40,226
What's going on here? Let me down!

1305
01:26:40,294 --> 01:26:43,012
Put me down, you monster, you ogre!

1306
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:45,181
I just want to go to sleep!

1307
01:26:45,248 --> 01:26:49,052
Ah, yes.

1308
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:51,388
There, little fella.

1309
01:26:51,456 --> 01:26:54,158
There's a safe place to keep you till I need you.

1310
01:26:54,226 --> 01:26:57,462
This gun will make our job much easier.

1311
01:26:57,531 --> 01:27:00,465
Now for our next victim... Tom.

1312
01:27:00,533 --> 01:27:02,068
Follow me, boys.

1313
01:27:04,939 --> 01:27:08,459
Please, please, don't let him do that to Tom.

1314
01:27:17,136 --> 01:27:18,487
Stop!

1315
01:27:18,554 --> 01:27:19,605
I beg your pardon?

1316
01:27:21,992 --> 01:27:24,244
After talking things over, we have decided

1317
01:27:24,312 --> 01:27:26,863
not to take part in your diabolical plan.

1318
01:27:26,931 --> 01:27:29,115
Consider us no longer in cahoots.

1319
01:27:29,183 --> 01:27:32,837
Furthermore, we are going to expose you to everybody.

1320
01:27:35,726 --> 01:27:37,910
Won't you reconsider?

1321
01:27:37,978 --> 01:27:39,462
Not a chance.

1322
01:27:39,529 --> 01:27:40,981
Gentlemen.

1323
01:27:41,049 --> 01:27:42,949
Now, there's no use in talking about it.

1324
01:27:43,017 --> 01:27:45,085
We want nothing more to do with...

1325
01:27:45,136 --> 01:27:48,089
Ohh, Mr. Barnaby! Please, Mr. Barnaby!

1326
01:27:48,156 --> 01:27:49,957
You wouldn't shoot us, would you?

1327
01:27:50,025 --> 01:27:51,175
Oh, Mr. Barnaby! Please, sir!

1328
01:28:01,055 --> 01:28:02,488
Peekaboo.

1329
01:28:33,026 --> 01:28:35,861
Please, please, go away, Mr. Barnaby!

1330
01:28:35,929 --> 01:28:37,230
Go away!

1331
01:28:37,298 --> 01:28:39,966
Please, leave us alone!

1332
01:28:40,034 --> 01:28:43,538
Good evening.

1333
01:28:43,572 --> 01:28:45,840
Mr. Barnaby.

1334
01:28:45,908 --> 01:28:47,659
What are you doing here?

1335
01:28:47,727 --> 01:28:50,062
I've come for you, my dear.

1336
01:28:50,129 --> 01:28:53,166
How dare you come into my room?

1337
01:28:53,233 --> 01:28:55,334
Tom! Tom!

1338
01:28:55,402 --> 01:28:57,070
No need to scream.

1339
01:28:57,138 --> 01:29:01,375
Your little Tom is quite close-by,

1340
01:29:01,442 --> 01:29:04,846
and I do mean your very little Tom.

1341
01:29:08,217 --> 01:29:09,351
Oh, no.

1342
01:29:09,418 --> 01:29:10,820
No.

1343
01:29:10,887 --> 01:29:14,874
I will now at last have your hand in marriage.

1344
01:29:14,942 --> 01:29:16,710
Never. Never!

1345
01:29:16,777 --> 01:29:18,262
Never!

1346
01:29:18,329 --> 01:29:20,748
May I remind you that just a little overdose of this...

1347
01:29:20,816 --> 01:29:23,634
Stop, stop!

1348
01:29:23,702 --> 01:29:25,403
I'll do anything you say.

1349
01:29:27,540 --> 01:29:29,991
Of course you will.

1350
01:29:30,059 --> 01:29:32,179
Come, my dear.

1351
01:29:41,790 --> 01:29:44,359
Now, if you folks are ready.

1352
01:29:44,427 --> 01:29:46,995
Are you ready, dear?

1353
01:29:51,402 --> 01:29:54,070
Are the witnesses ready?

1354
01:29:54,138 --> 01:29:57,307
And the best man?

1355
01:30:01,347 --> 01:30:05,651
Now, by the power vested in you as the Mayor of Toyland,

1356
01:30:05,719 --> 01:30:08,453
proceed with the marriage ceremony.

1357
01:30:08,521 --> 01:30:11,975
We are gathered here to witness this young lady

1358
01:30:12,043 --> 01:30:15,829
making her first step toward unhappiness.

1359
01:30:15,897 --> 01:30:17,348
She's gonna marry you.

1360
01:30:17,416 --> 01:30:19,417
What?

1361
01:30:19,484 --> 01:30:22,687
I was just trying to liven things up with a little humor.

1362
01:30:22,755 --> 01:30:25,624
Never mind the humor. Perform the ceremony.

1363
01:30:28,179 --> 01:30:31,981
We are gathered here to unite this man

1364
01:30:32,049 --> 01:30:36,336
with this poor, unfortunate girl n marriage.

1365
01:30:36,404 --> 01:30:40,541
Do you, Barnaby, take Mary to be your wedded wife,

1366
01:30:40,609 --> 01:30:46,582
to keep her in sickness, in adversity, in poverty, in tragedy,

1367
01:30:46,667 --> 01:30:49,285
in disaster... What are you doing?

1368
01:30:49,353 --> 01:30:51,688
Well, I was just trying to talk you out of it.

1369
01:30:51,756 --> 01:30:53,457
I'm warning you.

1370
01:30:53,525 --> 01:30:56,694
Do you, Barnaby, take Mary to be your wedded wife?

1371
01:30:56,762 --> 01:30:57,929
I do.

1372
01:30:57,997 --> 01:31:00,215
Are you sure you don't want to think this over?

1373
01:31:00,282 --> 01:31:01,867
I do not!

1374
01:31:01,885 --> 01:31:04,070
No, I can see that you don't.

1375
01:31:04,137 --> 01:31:06,840
Now, do you, uh, uh...

1376
01:31:13,149 --> 01:31:17,903
Do you, Mary, take this man to be your wedded husband?

1377
01:31:21,974 --> 01:31:23,743
I do.

1378
01:31:23,810 --> 01:31:26,295
That's funny, I take him to be your grandfather.

1379
01:31:27,347 --> 01:31:29,517
Would you stop this infernal stalling?

1380
01:31:29,584 --> 01:31:31,551
On with it! On with it!

1381
01:31:31,619 --> 01:31:34,923
Oh, for heaven's sake. Such a dreadful temper.

1382
01:31:34,991 --> 01:31:37,242
I'm glad I'm not marrying you.

1383
01:31:37,310 --> 01:31:40,146
Oh, I am marrying you, but I'm marrying you to her.

1384
01:31:40,181 --> 01:31:42,015
Now, where was I?

1385
01:31:42,082 --> 01:31:43,599
will you hurry up?

1386
01:31:43,666 --> 01:31:45,668
I want to get married.

1387
01:31:45,736 --> 01:31:48,255
All right, all right.

1388
01:31:48,323 --> 01:31:50,976
Now, uh, let me see now.

1389
01:31:51,027 --> 01:31:52,777
Yes, there it is.

1390
01:31:52,845 --> 01:31:56,132
Will you please tell me what the trouble is now?!

1391
01:31:56,200 --> 01:31:58,284
Oh, all right. Just a minute.

1392
01:31:58,351 --> 01:31:59,418
It won't be a minute.

1393
01:32:06,010 --> 01:32:09,513
Uh, we are gathered here...

1394
01:32:47,777 --> 01:32:49,043
Come on!

1395
01:32:54,184 --> 01:32:55,884
Drummers, forward!

1396
01:33:56,056 --> 01:34:00,477
Now, let me see... Where was I?

1397
01:34:00,512 --> 01:34:02,146
You were right here!

1398
01:34:02,213 --> 01:34:04,149
Oh, oh, heh, yes. Thank you.

1399
01:34:04,184 --> 01:34:06,118
Thank you very much. Thank you.

1400
01:34:06,186 --> 01:34:09,188
What's that?

1401
01:34:09,256 --> 01:34:11,608
They're playing the wrong music.

1402
01:34:11,675 --> 01:34:13,860
Well, get on with it anyway.

1403
01:34:13,927 --> 01:34:15,045
On with it!

1404
01:34:15,113 --> 01:34:16,480
All right.

1405
01:34:22,054 --> 01:34:24,923
Forward march!

1406
01:35:07,924 --> 01:35:10,310
Eyes right!

1407
01:35:44,285 --> 01:35:45,952
Where are my glasses?

1408
01:35:46,020 --> 01:35:48,305
They are on your head!

1409
01:35:48,307 --> 01:35:50,874
Oh, so they are.

1410
01:35:50,942 --> 01:35:53,010
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1411
01:35:53,077 --> 01:35:56,781
And let's have no more of these delays.

1412
01:35:56,816 --> 01:35:59,051
Now take her hand.

1413
01:36:05,427 --> 01:36:08,011
Now comes the good part.

1414
01:36:08,079 --> 01:36:10,614
If there is anyone... Any man,

1415
01:36:10,682 --> 01:36:12,651
or any woman, for that matter...

1416
01:36:12,718 --> 01:36:15,337
Who has good reason why this marriage

1417
01:36:15,371 --> 01:36:17,039
should not take place,

1418
01:36:17,107 --> 01:36:21,995
let him... or her if, you know... Whichever it is,

1419
01:36:22,062 --> 01:36:26,433
let them speak or... Stop!

1420
01:36:26,500 --> 01:36:29,019
Barnaby, you scoundrel, unhand that girl!

1421
01:36:29,087 --> 01:36:33,124
Look. Look who's run away to become a toy soldier.

1422
01:36:33,192 --> 01:36:34,059
Take cover, Mary.

1423
01:36:36,162 --> 01:36:37,262
Buglers!

1424
01:36:42,086 --> 01:36:44,053
Fire!

1425
01:36:47,759 --> 01:36:49,343
Fire!

1426
01:36:56,970 --> 01:36:58,338
All right!

1427
01:37:01,826 --> 01:37:03,143
Fire!

1428
01:37:04,979 --> 01:37:07,315
Fire!

1429
01:37:14,741 --> 01:37:16,341
Fire!

1430
01:37:22,483 --> 01:37:24,586
Give 'em a broadside!

1431
01:37:32,345 --> 01:37:33,962
Fire!

1432
01:37:36,984 --> 01:37:38,984
Fire!

1433
01:37:39,052 --> 01:37:40,738
Ohh!

1434
01:38:06,318 --> 01:38:07,870
Sound the charge!

1435
01:38:10,606 --> 01:38:11,489
Fire!

1436
01:38:15,012 --> 01:38:16,779
Infantry, attack!

1437
01:38:24,340 --> 01:38:25,691
Give 'im a broadside!

1438
01:38:36,888 --> 01:38:38,255
Fire!

1439
01:39:12,597 --> 01:39:13,998
Oh, my toys!

1440
01:39:14,065 --> 01:39:15,416
My toys!

1441
01:39:19,906 --> 01:39:21,356
Now for the toy general.

1442
01:39:21,391 --> 01:39:23,591
Watch out, Tom!

1443
01:39:28,632 --> 01:39:30,066
Fire!

1444
01:39:32,386 --> 01:39:33,453
Oh!

1445
01:39:37,025 --> 01:39:38,526
Bombs away!

1446
01:39:55,130 --> 01:39:57,715
That's enough of this horseplay.

1447
01:39:59,652 --> 01:40:02,270
Tom, look out!

1448
01:40:02,355 --> 01:40:03,940
This is better.

1449
01:40:10,966 --> 01:40:13,250
Mr. Barnaby!

1450
01:40:21,662 --> 01:40:23,196
Stop him!

1451
01:40:23,263 --> 01:40:24,814
Don't let him get away!

1452
01:40:24,882 --> 01:40:26,300
Barnaby!

1453
01:41:02,509 --> 01:41:04,995
Come on, Barnaby. Fight like a man.

1454
01:41:34,998 --> 01:41:36,765
Look out, Tom!

1455
01:41:45,377 --> 01:41:47,411
Tom!

1456
01:42:29,463 --> 01:42:31,397
I've got it! Oh, I've got it!

1457
01:42:31,465 --> 01:42:32,565
Mr. Toymaker!

1458
01:42:32,632 --> 01:42:33,767
Here I am.

1459
01:42:33,834 --> 01:42:35,769
Grumio, I'm down here!

1460
01:42:35,836 --> 01:42:38,104
Well, sir, it appears that you need a shot

1461
01:42:38,172 --> 01:42:40,441
of my new invention, my restoring formula.

1462
01:42:47,967 --> 01:42:49,367
Grumio.

1463
01:42:49,435 --> 01:42:50,537
Yes, sir?

1464
01:42:50,604 --> 01:42:52,271
You are a genius.

1465
01:42:52,340 --> 01:42:54,240
Oh, thank you, sir.

1466
01:42:54,308 --> 01:42:55,876
Hey, Grumio!

1467
01:42:55,944 --> 01:42:57,912
How about us?

1468
01:42:57,979 --> 01:43:00,330
Take care of my friends.

1469
01:43:10,260 --> 01:43:12,296
My friend and I would like to thank you.

1470
01:43:12,414 --> 01:43:15,315
Grumio, please, help Tom.

1471
01:43:15,417 --> 01:43:17,584
Anything you say, Mary. Where is he?

1472
01:43:17,651 --> 01:43:19,153
Here I am.

1473
01:43:23,025 --> 01:43:27,262
You can't seem to get it through your thick skull that I...

1474
01:43:27,330 --> 01:43:31,401
Am the head toymaker, and you are just my assistant.

1475
01:43:31,469 --> 01:43:33,403
Now you got it. Heh heh.

1476
01:43:33,471 --> 01:43:35,139
Step aside.

1477
01:43:35,207 --> 01:43:36,924
Allow me.

1478
01:43:48,655 --> 01:43:50,823
Darling, you were so brave.

1479
01:43:50,891 --> 01:43:53,059
I'm so proud of you.

1480
01:43:53,127 --> 01:43:54,611
What's going on?

1481
01:43:54,679 --> 01:43:56,614
What's all the noise?

1482
01:43:56,682 --> 01:43:59,867
Oh, you've been playing with the toys.

1483
01:43:59,935 --> 01:44:01,202
That's right, children.

1484
01:44:01,253 --> 01:44:02,971
We've been playing with the toys.

1485
01:44:03,039 --> 01:44:04,123
That's right.

1486
01:44:04,190 --> 01:44:05,941
We were just playing with the toys.
