- YEAH. ALL RIGHT.

1081
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:58,140
WHERE DOES FATHER
USUALLY LAND HIS CANOES?

1082
01:13:00,175 --> 01:13:02,511
- ALWAYS HERE.

1083
01:13:02,511 --> 01:13:05,647
ALWAYS TAKE THIS PATH
TO KABUNA HERE.

1084
01:13:05,647 --> 01:13:07,416
- WHAT DOES FATHER DO

1085
01:13:07,416 --> 01:13:10,085

01:13:12,354 --> 01:13:13,889
FATHER SAY...

1088
01:13:13,889 --> 01:13:15,657
[deep voice]
"I, TANAMASHU, HERE.

1089
01:13:15,657 --> 01:13:18,594
WHAT GREAT GOD KABUNA
GOT TO SAY?"

1090
01:13:18,594 --> 01:13:21,096
AND KABUNA SAY,

1091
01:13:21,096 --> 01:13:23,365
"YOU GOOD CHIEF,
TANAMASHU.

1092
01:13:23,365 --> 01:13:25,134
"KABUNA LIKE YOU PLENTY.

1093
01:13:25,134 --> 01:13:27,903

01:13:34,510 --> 01:13:38,013
- SOUNDS A LITTLE FISHY
TO ME.

1098
01:13:38,013 --> 01:13:40,315
YOU MEAN,
PEOPLE HEAR KABUNA SAY THIS?

1099
01:13:40,315 --> 01:13:41,316
- OH, NOT PEOPLE.

1100
01:13:41,316 --> 01:13:42,985
PEOPLE NOT HEAR.

1101
01:13:42,985 --> 01:13:45,654
KABUNA SPEAK ONLY TO FATHER.
ONLY FATHER HEAR.

1102
01:13:45,654 --> 01:13:48,690

I THINK I KNOW THAT BIT.

1105
01:13:54,129 --> 01:13:56,698
- WHAT'S
THE MATTER, "BIT"?

1106
01:13:59,067 --> 01:14:03,672
- I MAY JUST VISIT KABUNA
MYSELF.

1107
01:14:03,672 --> 01:14:05,340
