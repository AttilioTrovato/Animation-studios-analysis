00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,135
and the United States army.

182
00:09:36,143 --> 00:09:38,033
Since then, for eight years,

183
00:09:38,027 --> 00:09:39,907
I've been blowing a saxophone
and studying law on the side.

184
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:42,883
Now I've decided I'd like
to settle down someplace,

185
00:09:42,883 --> 00:09:45,853
and, uh,
well, I think this is it.

186
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:47,822
I could be
a crackerjack salesman,

187
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:49,791
or I could sweep
the place out.

188
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:55,786
- You can work up
to salesman later.

189
00:09:55,796 --> 00:09:57,826
- Thank you.

190
00:09:57,831 --> 00:09:59,661
- How about money?

191
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,696
- Oh, you name it, sir.

192
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:03,741
- $25 and a free go
at the candy counter.

193
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:05,297
- You've got a deal,
mister, uh...

194
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:06,365
- Uh, Hughes.

195
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:08,843
- Okay, Mr. Hughes,
I'm your boy.

196
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:10,882
- All right.
Stand right there.

197
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:13,707
Come on, Arthur.

198
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:15,784
- Well,
I guess that takes care

199
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,852
of the moon and Virgo
squared with Jupiter.

200
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:23,724
- Four, five, six bananas...

201
00:10:23,724 --> 00:10:28,164
And, uh,
two licorice whips.

202
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:29,731
- Thanks a lot.
- Thanks, Lem.

203
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,800
Don't forget, you're
in the ball game at lunch, Lem.

204
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,218
- I'll be there, hoodoo.

205
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:34,626
- Hi, Mrs. seibert.
- Hello, boys.

206
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:36,765
- Good morning, Hetty.
- Good morning, John.

207
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:37,940
- Good morning,
Mrs. seibert.

208
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:40,268
- Oh, good morning...
Lemuel?

209
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:41,273
- That's right.

210
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:42,914
- Oh. Isn't that
remarkable?

211
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:44,809
I remembered his name.

212
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:47,181
Are you getting settled
in hickory, lemuel?

213
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,910
- Oh, he's found
Artie's pool parlor

214
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,776
and has joined
the methodist church.

215
00:10:51,785 --> 00:10:52,715
- Fine...

216
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:54,249
About the church, I mean.

217
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:56,794
But don't drink any
of Artie's bootlegged whiskey.

218
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,760
- [Chuckles] Never touch
the stuff, Mrs. seibert.

219
00:10:58,759 --> 00:10:59,889
- Good.

220
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:02,293
Now, what did
I come in here for?

221
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:04,295
I know I'm in here
for some reason.

222
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:05,897
- Maybe I can help you,
Mrs. seibert.

223
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:07,729
Uh, was it something
in notions?

224
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:09,934
We're having a special
on assorted buttons and needles.

225
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:11,396
- Well, it wasn't notions,

226
00:11:11,405 --> 00:11:13,235
but I'll take
half a dozen packets.

227
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,440
- Fine.

228
00:11:14,441 --> 00:11:16,681
Uh, was it something
in yard goods?

229
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:17,837
- No.

230
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,814
- Thread maybe?
-Mm-mm.

231
00:11:19,813 --> 00:11:21,913
- Mrs. seibert, maybe you
came in for a dress pattern.

232
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:23,825
It's the latest thing.

233
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:25,753
It, uh, puts milady in style
for any social function.

234
00:11:25,752 --> 00:11:27,322
- That's it.

235
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,690
- Oh, good.

236
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:30,219
- Social function.

237
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:32,793
John, the most terrible thing's
happened to me.

238
00:11:32,793 --> 00:11:35,063
They've elected me president
of the civic club.

239
00:11:35,062 --> 00:11:36,702
Now, where is it?

240
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:37,897
- What, the civic club?

241
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:40,928
- No! No.
Here it is.

242
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:44,344
John, will you post this
in a conspicuous place?

243
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:46,737
It's a notice
of our Friday meeting

244
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,770
in the school auditorium.

245
00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:49,344
- Why, certainly, Hetty.

246
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:51,742
- I'm sure I'll be
a perfectly terrible president.

247
00:11:51,745 --> 00:11:54,775
They only elected me
because I have a lot of money.

248
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:56,481
I'll expect you both
at the meeting.

249
00:11:56,483 --> 00:11:58,753
- Oh, why, Hetty,
we wouldn't miss it.

250
00:11:58,752 --> 00:12:01,492
- Well, I would,
if I weren't president.

251
00:12:01,488 --> 00:12:03,818
- Oh, Mrs. seibert, uh,
do you still want these things?

252
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:05,124
- Oh, yes, thank you.

253
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:06,424
And will you charge it
to my account?

254
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:08,206
- Yes, I will.

255
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:09,990
- Now, where was I to go
from here?

256
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:11,456
- Uh, the bank?

257
00:12:11,465 --> 00:12:12,425
The butcher's?

258
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:14,132
The grocer?

259
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:15,833
- Never mind. I'll find out
when I get there.

260
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:16,936
Good-bye, John.

261
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:17,937
Good-bye...

262
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:18,968
- Lemuel.

263
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:19,972
- Lemuel.

264
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:22,873
- Good-bye, Mrs. seibert.

265
00:12:22,876 --> 00:12:25,376
[Bell jingles]

266
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:28,408
She, uh, is
a little forgetful, isn't she?

267
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:30,845
- About some things, yes.

268
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:33,851
Put that in a conspicuous spot,
will you, Lem?

269
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:35,794
I'll be in the office.
- Okay.

270
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:38,289
"Civic club meeting,
high school--

271
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,461
come and bring a friend."

272
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,870
9-3-4, please.

273
00:12:52,873 --> 00:12:54,973
I'd like to speak
to miss downey, please.

274
00:12:54,975 --> 00:12:59,505
[Line trilling]

275
00:12:59,513 --> 00:13:00,883
- Miss downey speaking.

276
00:13:00,881 --> 00:13:02,951
- Miss downey,
this is, uh, Lem siddons.

277
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:04,879
I'm calling you
from across the street.

278
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:06,115
Hi.

279
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:10,394
- Mr. siddons, if you're calling
in reference to your statement,

280
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,520
the bookkeeper--

281
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:12,885
- no, I'm calling
in reference to you.

282
00:13:12,893 --> 00:13:15,163
Uh, can you see this?

283
00:13:15,162 --> 00:13:18,862
- Mr. siddons, I am
terribly busy at the moment.

284
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:20,425
- I-I know you can't read it
from there,

285
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:23,073
but, uh, well, it says
there's gonna be big doings

286
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:25,039
at the civic club
on Friday night

287
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:26,568
and, uh, to come
and bring a friend.

288
00:13:26,573 --> 00:13:28,543
- I'm sorry, Mr. siddons. I--

289
00:13:28,542 --> 00:13:30,912
- looks like it's gonna be
a pretty exciting night.

290
00:13:30,911 --> 00:13:32,981
Mayor plummer's gonna
talk about the sewer problem,

291
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,509
uh, look into the future.

292
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:36,304
- Mr. siddons!

293
00:13:36,304 --> 00:13:38,094
- And there's gonna be
a group discussion

294
00:13:38,094 --> 00:13:39,884
on our youth today,
followed by refreshments.

295
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:40,916
Do you think
maybe you could make it?

296
00:13:40,921 --> 00:13:43,371
- Mr. siddons!

297
00:13:43,373 --> 00:13:45,823
I suppose the antics
of our small town amuse you.

298
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:46,826
- Oh, now,
I was only kidding. I--

299
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:48,487
- we must seem
terribly crude

300
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:50,595
to one who has traveled
so widely.

301
00:13:50,597 --> 00:13:51,927
- Anything wrong,
miss downey?

302
00:13:51,932 --> 00:13:53,202
- Oh, no.

303
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,570
- Look, miss downey,
I'm crazy about this town.

304
00:13:55,569 --> 00:13:59,869
Mr. Hastings, I was talking
to miss downey.

305
00:13:59,873 --> 00:14:01,973
Mr. Hastings!

306
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:03,205
- Yes, Mr. siddons?

307
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,040
- I was talking
to miss downey.

308
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:06,605
- I'm sorry.

309
00:14:06,613 --> 00:14:08,883
No personal calls
during banking hours.

310
00:14:08,882 --> 00:14:09,952
- Now--

311
00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:31,595
- now, if you will permit me,

312
00:14:31,605 --> 00:14:33,435
fellow civic clubbers,

313
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,940
I will conclude
my very small remarks

314
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:40,653
with a line from
that immortal English poet--

315
00:14:40,647 --> 00:14:42,077
a...

316
00:14:42,082 --> 00:14:45,122
A thing of beauty

317
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:47,648
is a joy forever.

318
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:50,924
[Applause]

319
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,187
- Thank you,
Cora Anderson,

320
00:14:56,196 --> 00:14:59,096
for that splendid talk on...

321
00:14:59,099 --> 00:15:01,069
Oh, dear, what was
your subject, Cora?

322
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,527
[Laughter]
- The town square.

323
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:05,935
- Oh, the town square,
of course.

324
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:08,509
Uh, were you for it
or against it?

325
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:11,138
- I wanted
to plant peonies.

326
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:12,684
- Oh, well,
bless you, dear.

327
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:14,209
Go right ahead
and do it.

328
00:15:14,214 --> 00:15:16,924
[Laughter]

329
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:18,147
And now...

330
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:22,991
And now a word about our youth
from the chair.

331
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:27,685
The chair--
that must be me.

332
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:31,234
Well, I warned you I'd be
a perfectly terrible president.

333
00:15:31,231 --> 00:15:33,561
[Applause]

334
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:37,036
Well, a word
about our youth,

335
00:15:37,037 --> 00:15:38,637
especially boys.

336
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:42,938
Frankly, I think boys
are splendid.

337
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:45,643
Granted, they steal
a few apples

338
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:48,575
and play ball
in the town square,

339
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:52,151
spill a few garbage pails,
and...

340
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:54,692
Put tin cans on cats,

341
00:15:54,688 --> 00:15:56,718
which isn't very nice.

342
00:15:56,723 --> 00:15:59,723
But perhaps the fault
lies with us.

343
00:15:59,726 --> 00:16:02,726
Perhaps we could buy them
a playing field

344
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:06,729
or something constructive.

345
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:10,503
Well, I can't think
of anything else.

346
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:13,243
I think Mr. hi plummer,
our mayor,

347
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:15,339
should conduct the balance
of this meeting.

348
00:16:15,342 --> 00:16:18,982
[Applause]

349
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:26,145
- Well, there isn't very much
to conduct, folks.

350
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:29,622
I think our boys
should be kept off the streets,

351
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:31,862
but how?

352
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:34,087
I'd like to hear
some suggestions.

353
00:16:34,094 --> 00:16:37,164
- Uh, Mr. mayor?

354
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:38,763
I have a suggestion.

355
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:41,025
Mr. mayor,
I'm new here in town,

356
00:16:41,034 --> 00:16:42,634
so, uh, maybe
I shouldn't even speak up,

357
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:44,765
but, uh,
well, it seems to me

358
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:46,741
that the solution
to this problem

359
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,170
would be to have
some sort of organized activity

360
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:51,135
for the boys, like, uh...

361
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:54,354
Well, like
the, uh, boy scouts.

362
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,107
Well, good evening,
miss downey,

363
00:16:56,116 --> 00:16:57,346
Mr. Hastings.

364
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:00,020
- I was going to suggest
that very thing.

365
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,620
- Newer.
- Look.

366
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:03,791
- Well, that idea
comes up every year, Lem,

367
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,660
but nothing ever seems
to come of it.

368
00:17:05,658 --> 00:17:07,128
- Well, then I think

369
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:08,787
you ought make something
come of it.

370
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:11,125
- There's always
one trouble.

371
00:17:11,131 --> 00:17:13,801
Nobody ever wants
to be scoutmaster.

372
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,670
- You could do that, Ralph.

373
00:17:15,668 --> 00:17:16,968
- No, no,
I'm too busy, vida.

374
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:18,269
- It wouldn't take
very much of your time.

375
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:19,671
- Absolutely not.

376
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:21,672
- I thank you
for your suggestion, Lem,

377
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:24,114
but I'm afraid that's one job
that will go a-begging.

378
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:26,380
- Well, Mr. mayor, uh...

379
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,379
I might have to take
the job myself.

380
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,381
[Crowd gasping positively]

381
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:32,823
- Are you volunteering?
- I guess I am.

382

[Applause]

383
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:40,160
- Come up here, young man.
I want to shake your hand.

384
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:46,757
- Hup, two, three, four.

Hup, two--
no, wait, wait, fellas.

398
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:12,322
Hoodoo!

399
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:13,825
Where you going?

400
00:18:13,827 --> 00:18:15,227
- But you said
to the right.

401
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:16,758
- Well, you--
you turned left, hoodoo.

402
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,633
[Applause]

403
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:19,731

Hup, two, three, four.

412
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:35,884
- What you trying to do
with them poor kids, Lem?

413
00:18:35,882 --> 00:18:37,752
- Just keeping them
out of the pool halls, Artie.

414
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,680
Hup, two, three, four.

415

[Rock thumps]

422
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:21,160
- Hey, what's the matter?
Are you wise or something?

423
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:23,331
- Go ahead, beefy,
mobilize him.

424
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,459
- Yeah!

425
00:19:24,464 --> 00:19:26,204
[Boys shouting]

426
00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:27,799
- Beefy!

427
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,870
Never mind the mobilizing.

428
00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:30,168
Get back in line.
Come on.

429
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,900
All of you.

430
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:40,775
- This is
private property, mister.

431
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,510
Stay off.

432
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:44,245
I'm warning you, mister.

433
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,820
- Look, son--

434
00:19:45,818 --> 00:19:47,518
- [irish accent]
What's going on here, huh?

435
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:51,486
- Hello, ed.

436
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,230
- I know you,
don't I, yeah?

437
00:19:56,229 --> 00:19:58,829
Yeah. You're Lem--
Lem siddons

438
00:19:58,831 --> 00:20:00,231
from Artie's place,
right?

439
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:02,373
- That's right.
- Yeah.

440
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:04,838
Well, what--what seems
to be the trouble here?

441
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:05,967
- Oh, no trouble, ed.

442
00:20:05,972 --> 00:20:08,512
We're, uh, starting
a scout troop.

443
00:20:08,508 --> 00:20:10,338
I thought maybe your boy
would like to join up.

444
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:11,343
- Sure, whitey.

445
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:12,844
You go along
with them, huh?

446
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:15,245
- I don't go picking daisies
with a bunch of mama's boys.

447
00:20:15,248 --> 00:20:17,578
- Oh, now, how often
have I told you not to--

448
00:20:17,584 --> 00:20:20,324
- that's all right, ed.

449
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,520
Maybe some other time.

450
00:20:23,523 --> 00:20:25,363

let's get back in line now.

being a roughneck, huh?

[Sighs]

457
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:50,282

You'll feel better.

- Yes, I guess I will.

459

the, uh, serious stuff,

to learn as much as you do.

to make this

will be proud of, huh?

make it, Lem.

Now, when we start off again,

495
00:22:24,326 --> 00:22:25,976
why don't we see if we can't
sort of shape up, huh?

- What do you mean
by shape up?

we march in time,

that'll help maybe,

of a marching song.

of a marching song is that?

- That's good.
- Sing it, Lem.

539
00:23:41,654 --> 00:23:43,054
- Well, it's something
our old outfit

540
00:23:43,055 --> 00:23:44,955
used to sing
over in France.

541
00:23:44,957 --> 00:23:46,657
We made it up
about this sergeant we had,

542
00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:48,059
sergeant Riley.

543
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,690
Ha! He was always hollering,
"follow me."

544
00:23:49,695 --> 00:23:51,525
- Well, then sing it, Lem.

545
00:23:51,531 --> 00:23:53,431
- Let's see now.

546
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:55,533
How'd the verse go?

547
00:23:55,535 --> 00:23:59,795
¶ Sergeant Riley said
there's a fight to win ¶

548

¶ and it won't be done
till we all pitch in ¶

551

Pick them up!

Hup, two, three, four!

Hup, two, three, four!

585
00:25:09,742 --> 00:25:11,782
We're doing pretty good
for three weeks, huh, Lem?

586
00:25:11,777 --> 00:25:13,257
- We sure are, hoodoo.

587
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:14,741
Just about the whole troop
can count up to four.

588
00:25:14,747 --> 00:25:16,147
- Sure can.

589
00:25:16,148 --> 00:25:17,778
Hup, two, three, four.

[Car horn honks]

Car's coming, Lem.

592
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:22,085
Hey, you guys,
there's a car coming!

593
00:25:22,088 --> 00:25:24,218
[Horn honking]

[Boys complaining]

595
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:30,789
- Ralph! That was
uncalled for.

596
00:25:30,796 --> 00:25:32,796
- This is a road
for motor vehicles,

597
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:34,228
not a marching trail.

598
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:36,303
- Just because he's
the vice President of the bank!

599
00:25:36,302 --> 00:25:38,642
- I'd like to give him
a good turn.

600
00:25:38,638 --> 00:25:40,168
- All right,
knock it off, fellas.

601
00:25:40,172 --> 00:25:41,772
Knock it off.
Forget it, now, will you?

602
00:25:41,774 --> 00:25:43,644
Now, let's see, uh,

603
00:25:43,643 --> 00:25:45,743
according to this gadget,
we've hiked about two Miles.

604
00:25:45,745 --> 00:25:47,775
How about the, uh,
tracking game now, huh?

605
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,480
All: Yeah!

606
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:51,181
- I ain't gonna be
the raccoon again.

607
00:25:51,183 --> 00:25:53,623
Last time, them guys tried
to step on my tail.

608
00:25:53,619 --> 00:25:54,749
- Oh, yeah?
But it's your turn.

609
00:25:54,754 --> 00:25:56,324
- Yeah!
It's your turn!

610
00:25:56,322 --> 00:25:57,792
- Look, I'll be the raccoon
this time.

611
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,220
You fellas
be the hound dogs, huh?

612
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:00,785
[All howling]
Wait a minute.

613
00:26:00,793 --> 00:26:02,793
Now, the hound dogs
count up to 50

614
00:26:02,795 --> 00:26:03,855
to give the raccoon
a start, okay?

615
00:26:03,863 --> 00:26:05,233
- [Quickly]
One, two, three, four--

616
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:07,131
- now, wait a minute, hoodoo,
slow, slow.

617
00:26:07,133 --> 00:26:09,573
One...Two...Three...

618
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:10,729
I'll see you later,
fellas.

619
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:13,766
- Five, six, seven, eight,

All: 13, 14, 15, 16, 17...

623
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:46,137
- Hi.

624
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:47,708
- [Gasps]

625
00:26:47,707 --> 00:26:49,107
Oh, hello.

626
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:50,238
- Say, you haven't seen

627
00:26:50,242 --> 00:26:51,882
my boy scout troop around,
have you?

628
00:26:51,877 --> 00:26:53,277
They're supposed to be
tracking a raccoon.

629
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,679
I'm the raccoon.

630
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,200
- [Laughs]

631
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:57,718
- Well, what seems
to be the trouble here?

632
00:26:57,717 --> 00:26:59,777
- I don't know.
I guess it's my fault.

633
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:01,085
I wanted to go
on a picnic,

634
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:02,386
and the car
doesn't like picnics.

635
00:27:02,388 --> 00:27:05,118
- Oh.

636
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:07,863
- Mr. Hastings just went
to get a tow truck.

637
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:08,960
- Well, I could try
to fix it for you,

638
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:11,361
but, uh,
I'd gum it up.

639
00:27:11,364 --> 00:27:12,364
- Really?

640
00:27:12,365 --> 00:27:13,725
- Yeah, I'm all thumbs.

641
00:27:13,733 --> 00:27:15,703
- I've never met a man
who admitted

642
00:27:15,701 --> 00:27:16,831
he couldn't fix
an automobile.

643
00:27:16,836 --> 00:27:18,336
- Well, that's me.
[Laughs]

644
00:27:18,337 --> 00:27:19,867
Hey, you know,
it's kind of a hot day

645
00:27:19,872 --> 00:27:21,062
to be a raccoon.

646
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,236
You don't mind
if I just stay here

647
00:27:22,241 --> 00:27:23,641
and wait for the hounds,
do you?

648
00:27:23,643 --> 00:27:24,913
- Oh, no,
of course not.

649
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,740
Uh, as a matter of fact--

650
00:27:26,746 --> 00:27:28,206
- miss downey, you, uh,

651
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:29,683
have a little smudge
on your nose there.

652
00:27:30,716 --> 00:27:31,946
- Oh.

653
00:27:36,956 --> 00:27:39,186
As a matter of fact,
I wanted to tell you

654
00:27:39,191 --> 00:27:40,721
how pleased I was
that you mentioned

655
00:27:40,726 --> 00:27:42,686
the boy scouts
at the civic club meeting.

656
00:27:42,695 --> 00:27:43,855
- Oh!

657
00:27:43,863 --> 00:27:45,733
- I was going to suggest
the same thing.

658
00:27:45,731 --> 00:27:47,201
- Were you really?
- Yes.

659
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:48,429
- Well, isn't that remarkable?

660
00:27:48,434 --> 00:27:50,874
Well, why don't we sit down
and discuss it?

661
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:52,240
Now, uh--
oh, I'm sorry.

662
00:27:52,238 --> 00:27:53,438
Would you care
for a drink?

663
00:27:53,439 --> 00:27:54,739
- No, I'm not thirsty.

664
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:55,940
- Well, now,
about the scouts.

665
00:27:55,941 --> 00:27:59,341
The way I look at it--
[Boys howling]

666
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:01,875
- What does that
sound like to you?

667
00:28:01,881 --> 00:28:03,781
- Like a raccoon
is about to be treed.

668
00:28:03,783 --> 00:28:04,783
- Yeah.

669
00:28:04,784 --> 00:28:06,824
[All howling]

670
00:28:06,819 --> 00:28:08,789
Okay, okay, okay!

671
00:28:08,788 --> 00:28:10,018
I'm treed! I'm treed!

672
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:11,722
Okay, guys, you got me!

673
00:28:11,724 --> 00:28:12,924
I'm treed! I'm treed!

674
00:28:12,925 --> 00:28:14,215
[Laughing]

675
00:28:14,226 --> 00:28:15,886
- What do we do now, Lem?

676
00:28:15,895 --> 00:28:19,825
- Oh. Well, uh...

677
00:28:19,832 --> 00:28:21,832
We're going to do
what all good scouts do--

678
00:28:21,834 --> 00:28:23,434
lend a helping hand.

679
00:28:23,436 --> 00:28:26,396
Miss downey, would you
get in the car, please?

680
00:28:26,405 --> 00:28:27,435
Troop one will show you

681
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,470
how scouts do
a good turn daily.

682
00:28:29,475 --> 00:28:31,475
Now, you bigger fellas
get behind the car,

683
00:28:31,477 --> 00:28:33,477
and you other fellas
get on each side, okay?

684
00:28:33,479 --> 00:28:35,409
Miss downey, just slide
back of the wheel, huh?

685
00:28:36,982 --> 00:28:41,022
[Overlapping chatter]

686
00:28:50,362 --> 00:28:51,762
- Aren't you tired?

687
00:28:51,764 --> 00:28:52,964
- Practically dead.

688
00:28:52,965 --> 00:28:54,465
Got just about
enough strength left

689
00:28:54,467 --> 00:28:56,897
to ask you to go
to the movies with me tonight.

690
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:58,502
- Oh, I'm sorry, Mr.--

691
00:28:58,504 --> 00:28:59,804
- feel free
to call me Lem, huh?

692
00:28:59,805 --> 00:29:00,865
- Mr. siddons--

693
00:29:00,873 --> 00:29:02,073
- I'm named
after my Uncle lemuel,

694
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:03,874
who never amounted
to anything.

695
00:29:03,876 --> 00:29:05,106
- I'm busy tonight,
Mr. siddons.

696
00:29:05,111 --> 00:29:06,511
- Oh. You know
the first thing

697
00:29:06,512 --> 00:29:07,852
I noticed about you,
miss downey?

698
00:29:07,847 --> 00:29:08,977
Your eyes--blue eyes.

699
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:10,111
That means honesty.

700
00:29:10,116 --> 00:29:11,816
- I really am sorry.

701
00:29:11,817 --> 00:29:12,947
- Now, honestly,
wouldn't you rather see

702
00:29:12,952 --> 00:29:14,422
Ronald Coleman
and Carole lombard

703
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,050
in the soul-searching drama
of--hey!

704
00:29:16,055 --> 00:29:17,855
Hey, wait!
Look out, guys!

705
00:29:17,857 --> 00:29:19,987
Put on--
put on the brake!

706
00:29:19,992 --> 00:29:22,092
- Oh!
I'm sorry!

707
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:23,894
The hill was on me
before I knew it.

708
00:29:23,896 --> 00:29:25,796
- Oh, that's all right.
I didn't see it, either.

709
00:29:25,798 --> 00:29:27,868
Fellas, pile on, and
we'll coast down the hill, huh?

710
00:29:27,867 --> 00:29:29,477
- Aw, neat.

711
00:29:29,484 --> 00:29:31,104
- Miss downey, uh,
put on your emergency brake.

712
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:33,443
Move over
and let me drive.

713
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:34,869
I'll, uh, put it in gear.

714
00:29:34,874 --> 00:29:36,544
Maybe we can start
the motor.

715
00:29:36,542 --> 00:29:38,142
Everybody in?

716
00:29:38,144 --> 00:29:39,484
All: Yeah!

717
00:29:39,478 --> 00:29:41,008
- Okay, now, hang on!

718
00:29:41,013 --> 00:29:43,853
[Boys shouting]

719
00:29:48,554 --> 00:29:49,924
[Car backfires]

720
00:29:49,922 --> 00:29:52,392
[Boys shouting]

721
00:29:56,162 --> 00:29:58,832
[Horn honking]

722
00:29:58,831 --> 00:30:01,931
- [Coughing]

723
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:13,813
Thank you
for almost running me down.

724
00:30:13,813 --> 00:30:15,413
- Well, we were just doing
our good turn.

725
00:30:15,414 --> 00:30:16,584
We got your motor going.

726
00:30:16,582 --> 00:30:18,182
- All right,
out of there, all of you.

727
00:30:18,184 --> 00:30:20,054
This car wasn't built to hold
every hoodlum in town.

728
00:30:20,052 --> 00:30:21,452
- Ralph!

729
00:30:21,453 --> 00:30:23,153
- That's all right,
miss downey.

730
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:25,185
All right, you, uh, hoodlums,
pile out of there.

731
00:30:25,191 --> 00:30:26,861
We've got a hike to finish.
Come on.

732
00:30:26,859 --> 00:30:27,929
- Aw, we'd rather ride.

733
00:30:27,927 --> 00:30:29,457
- Oh, Mr. Hastings,

734
00:30:29,461 --> 00:30:33,401
from now on, I'm the only one
who calls them that, right?

735
00:30:33,399 --> 00:30:34,899
Where's the can--
oh, thanks.

736
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,900
All right,
now line up by twos.

737
00:30:37,903 --> 00:30:41,413
- Come on.
- Let's go.

738
00:30:41,407 --> 00:30:43,007
- Frankie,
you get them started.

739
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:45,178
- Hup, two, three, four.

740
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:47,077
All:
Hup, two, three, four.

741
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:49,479
Hup! Pick them up,
put them down.

742
00:30:49,481 --> 00:30:50,581
Pick them up.

743
00:30:50,583 --> 00:30:51,883
¶ Follow me, boys ¶

744
00:30:51,884 --> 00:30:53,854
- that was
unnecessarily rude, Ralph.

745
00:30:53,853 --> 00:30:55,353
- Get in the car, vida.

746
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:56,854
- They were just trying
to help with the car.

747
00:30:56,856 --> 00:30:59,086
- Vida, will you please
get in the car?

748
00:30:59,091 --> 00:31:02,631
- ¶ Follow me, boys,

749
00:31:02,628 --> 00:31:04,458

- Mr. siddons!
- ¶ follow me, boys ¶

753
00:31:08,634 --> 00:31:10,174
Mr. siddons!
- Vida, come back here!

754
00:31:10,169 --> 00:31:12,569
- ¶ When you think
you're really beat ¶

- ¶ Follow me ¶

[horn honks]

762
00:31:25,885 --> 00:31:27,915
- Lovely movie.

763
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,220
- Yes.

764
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:31,221
Hello, Mr. Lee.

765
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:33,023
Yes, I'm glad
she finally realized

766
00:31:33,025 --> 00:31:35,185
that, uh,
money isn't everything.

767
00:31:35,194 --> 00:31:36,664
- Well, when a girl
has Ronald Coleman,

768
00:31:36,662 --> 00:31:37,662
she doesn't need money.

769
00:31:37,663 --> 00:31:38,963
- [Laughs]

770
00:31:38,964 --> 00:31:40,264
Oh, uh, would you like
a soda

771
00:31:40,266 --> 00:31:41,666
or a banana split
or something?

772
00:31:41,667 --> 00:31:43,097
- I don't think so.

773
00:31:43,102 --> 00:31:44,602
- You sure?
- Sure.

774
00:31:44,603 --> 00:31:46,973
- Well...

775
00:31:46,972 --> 00:31:48,972
[Horn honks]

776
00:31:50,609 --> 00:31:53,579
Tell me.
Was he sore?

777
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:54,909
- Ronald Coleman?

778
00:31:54,914 --> 00:31:57,114
- No, Mr. Hastings, Ralph.

779
00:31:57,116 --> 00:31:59,016
I mean, because you broke
your date with him

780
00:31:59,018 --> 00:32:00,478
and went to the movies
with me.

781
00:32:00,486 --> 00:32:02,246
- You're a somewhat
blunt fellow, aren't you?

782
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:04,254
- Well, when I want to know
something, I ask.

783
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:07,016
- Well, we like more reserve
here in hickory.

784
00:32:07,026 --> 00:32:09,026
- [Chuckles]
Okay, so he got sore.

785
00:32:09,028 --> 00:32:10,988
Vida...

786
00:32:10,996 --> 00:32:12,556
What are you doing
tomorrow night?

787
00:32:12,564 --> 00:32:14,264
- Well, Lem, I--
- and Monday night?

788
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:15,666
- Lem.
- And Tuesday night?

789
00:32:15,668 --> 00:32:16,668
- Oh, Lem.
- And--

790
00:32:16,669 --> 00:32:18,039
[dog barking]

791
00:32:18,037 --> 00:32:19,967
[Whining]

792
00:32:24,543 --> 00:32:26,513
Uh, wait a minute.

793
00:32:29,715 --> 00:32:32,015
[Dog whining]

794
00:32:52,104 --> 00:32:53,204

[Whining]

796
00:32:55,207 --> 00:32:56,737
- Beat it, Dutch!

797
00:32:58,043 --> 00:32:59,583
- Are you hurt?

798
00:32:59,578 --> 00:33:00,928
- No, I'm all right.

799
00:33:00,929 --> 00:33:02,279
- Well, then get up
on your feet.

800
00:33:02,281 --> 00:33:03,311
- [Groans]

801
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:04,575
- He is hurt, Lem.

802
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:07,023
- The ankle, huh?
- It's okay.

803
00:33:07,019 --> 00:33:08,719
- Vida, get me
a first-aid kit

804
00:33:08,721 --> 00:33:10,121
out of the scout section,
will you?

805
00:33:10,122 --> 00:33:11,662
Come over here
and sit down,

806
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:12,757
so I can take a look
at that ankle.

807
00:33:12,758 --> 00:33:14,058
- I'm all right,
I tell you!

808
00:33:14,059 --> 00:33:15,229
- Come over here
and sit down.

809
00:33:15,227 --> 00:33:17,557
- Ooh!

810
00:33:22,234 --> 00:33:24,674
[Dog whines]

811
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,640
- "Over the shoe
and tie firmly,

812
00:33:26,638 --> 00:33:28,268
"because once you take
the shoe off,

813
00:33:28,273 --> 00:33:31,113
you can't get it
back on with the swelling."

814
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:32,740
- Well,
that makes sense, huh?

815
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:40,183
All right, now try
to walk on it.

816
00:33:51,063 --> 00:33:52,303
Does that feel better?

817
00:33:52,297 --> 00:33:54,797
- Yeah, it's okay.

818
00:34:05,778 --> 00:34:08,608
That's a pretty good trick.

819
00:34:08,614 --> 00:34:11,114
- Yeah, there are
a lot of good tricks in here.

820
00:34:11,116 --> 00:34:14,246
- Aw, I don't go
for that scout stuff.

821
00:34:14,253 --> 00:34:16,053
- Well, you better
get going.

822
00:34:18,757 --> 00:34:19,787
- Get going?

823
00:34:19,792 --> 00:34:22,762
- Yeah.

824
00:34:22,761 --> 00:34:24,331
And put some cold towels
on that ankle

825
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:27,299
when you get home.

826
00:34:27,299 --> 00:34:29,069
- Okay.

827
00:34:32,805 --> 00:34:35,605
Come on, Dutch.

828
00:34:35,607 --> 00:34:37,667
- Uh, why don't we
just leave this?

829
00:34:37,676 --> 00:34:39,176
I'll come in early
in the morning

830
00:34:39,178 --> 00:34:41,708
and clean it up.

831
00:34:41,713 --> 00:34:43,183
- Think you should
have done that?

832
00:34:43,182 --> 00:34:45,082
Let him go, I mean.

833
00:34:45,084 --> 00:34:46,454
- I don't know.

834
00:34:48,687 --> 00:34:50,687
- He was stealing,
you know?

835
00:34:50,689 --> 00:34:54,219
- Yeah.

836
00:34:54,226 --> 00:34:57,686
You know, I was just like that
when I was his age,

837
00:34:57,696 --> 00:34:59,656
sore at the world,
picking fights,

838
00:34:59,665 --> 00:35:02,395
trying to act tough.

839
00:35:02,401 --> 00:35:03,871
But then, uh...

840
00:35:03,869 --> 00:35:06,699
Well, there was this fella,
he was a young lawyer,

841
00:35:06,705 --> 00:35:08,235
sort of took me
under his wing.

842
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,310
I guess he felt sorry
for this kid

843
00:35:10,309 --> 00:35:11,879
who was trying to lick
half of South Chicago

844
00:35:11,877 --> 00:35:13,707
and couldn't.

845
00:35:13,712 --> 00:35:14,782
Anyway, he, uh...

846
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,450
He finally
straightened me out,

847
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:18,818
got me thinking right.

848
00:35:18,817 --> 00:35:21,717
If it hadn't been
for him, I, uh...

849
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,220
I'd have ended up in some kind
of serious trouble for sure.

850
00:35:24,223 --> 00:35:26,363
I guess
it's about that time

851
00:35:26,358 --> 00:35:29,828
I got the idea
I wanted to be a lawyer someday.

852
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:33,657
No, I don't think
turning whitey in

853
00:35:33,665 --> 00:35:35,895
would help anything.

854
00:35:35,901 --> 00:35:37,731
You just got to
take a chance.

855
00:35:45,844 --> 00:35:47,844
Well, we'd better go, huh?

856
00:35:50,782 --> 00:35:51,852
- Lem?

857
00:36:16,208 --> 00:36:20,208
- Now, beefy and quong.

858
00:36:20,212 --> 00:36:22,412
- That's for
your second-class cooking test?

859
00:36:22,414 --> 00:36:24,514
- Beefy, uh,
could you indentify

860
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:25,846
that interesting object?

861
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:28,191
- Well, it started out
as eight biscuits, Lem,

862
00:36:28,187 --> 00:36:29,817
but it ended up one.

863
00:36:29,821 --> 00:36:30,891
- Oh.

864
00:36:30,889 --> 00:36:32,489
- Do we pass?

865
00:36:32,491 --> 00:36:35,331
- I, uh, think you better
try again, fellas.

866
00:36:35,327 --> 00:36:36,957
Why don't you
start out with one?

867
00:36:36,962 --> 00:36:39,462
Maybe it'll end up eight.

868
00:36:39,464 --> 00:36:40,834
[Hammer tapping]

869
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,302
How you coming, Dave?

870
00:36:42,301 --> 00:36:43,871
- Well, not finished yet.

871
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:45,769
- Carrick bend, huh?
Good.

872
00:36:45,771 --> 00:36:47,841
- When we get finished,
can we take her out?

873
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:49,769
- Of course
we can't take her out.

874
00:36:49,775 --> 00:36:50,765
The patch isn't dry.

875
00:36:50,776 --> 00:36:52,806
- What would happen?

876
00:36:52,811 --> 00:36:54,831
- She'd sink.

877
00:36:54,829 --> 00:36:56,849
- That wouldn't help for
a canoe merit badge, would it?

878
00:36:56,848 --> 00:36:59,578
- Hoodoo, one thing
I got to give you credit for.

879
00:36:59,585 --> 00:37:00,975
You think quick.

880
00:37:00,986 --> 00:37:02,986
- Yeah, I know.

881
00:37:02,988 --> 00:37:06,288
[Truck rumbling]

882
00:37:06,291 --> 00:37:07,961
- Hey, look who's here.

883
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,430
What do you suppose
miss downey's here for?

884
00:37:17,436 --> 00:37:18,566
- Lem.

885
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:21,910
- Like I said, hoodoo,
you think quick.

886
00:37:25,877 --> 00:37:27,077
- Hi.

887
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,278
- I was, uh,
invited out here

888
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,880
to see scouting
in action, remember?

889
00:37:29,881 --> 00:37:32,551
- Well, you can see
Lem in action later.

890
00:37:32,551 --> 00:37:33,621
And you're just in time

891
00:37:33,619 --> 00:37:34,819
for the second-class
cooking test.

892
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:36,420
- I thought I might be.

893
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:38,291
You know, ever since
you invited me out here,

894
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:40,360
I got to thinking
about those poor boys out here,

895
00:37:40,359 --> 00:37:41,889
eating their own cooking.

896
00:37:41,893 --> 00:37:43,293
I got so emotional,
I went home

897
00:37:43,295 --> 00:37:44,995
and fried up six chickens,

898
00:37:44,997 --> 00:37:46,497
made four pounds
of potato salad.

899
00:37:46,498 --> 00:37:47,898
- Uh, vida?

900
00:37:47,899 --> 00:37:49,899
- I even iced
a three-layer chocolate cake.

901
00:37:49,901 --> 00:37:52,541
- Vida, maybe I gave you
a bum steer,

902
00:37:52,537 --> 00:37:53,897
but the boys
are taking tests

903
00:37:53,905 --> 00:37:54,895
so that when
they get in the woods,

904
00:37:54,906 --> 00:37:56,366
they'll be self-reliant.

905
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:57,865
- Well, they'll be
twice as self-reliant

906
00:37:57,876 --> 00:37:59,336
on full stomachs.

907
00:37:59,343 --> 00:38:00,813
- [Chuckles] I...
I appreciate your interest

908
00:38:00,812 --> 00:38:02,512
in scout stomachs,
but, uh,

909
00:38:02,514 --> 00:38:06,324
I think you better take
the chicken back to the truck.

910
00:38:06,318 --> 00:38:07,478
- Is that an order?

911
00:38:07,486 --> 00:38:09,586
- No, it's
just a suggestion.

912
00:38:09,588 --> 00:38:11,888
- In other words,
you forbid me?

913
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:13,620
- No, I don't forbid you
exactly.

914
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:16,025
- Good.
- Now, wait a minute.

915
00:38:16,028 --> 00:38:17,528
- All right, I, uh...

916
00:38:17,529 --> 00:38:19,429
I forbid you.

917
00:38:19,431 --> 00:38:21,901
- Well, now you sound
like Ralph Hastings.

918
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:22,900
- Oh, now...

919
00:38:22,901 --> 00:38:24,671
- Anyone eat fried chicken?

920
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:26,540
- Fred chicken? Yeah!

921
00:38:26,538 --> 00:38:28,408
- Vida, what do you think
you're doing?

922
00:38:28,407 --> 00:38:29,867
- I'm feeding
hungry boys.

923
00:38:29,875 --> 00:38:31,535
- Well, that's exactly
what you're not doing.

924
00:38:31,543 --> 00:38:33,413
- Chicken!
- Now, wait a minute, fellas!

925
00:38:33,412 --> 00:38:34,682
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute, now!

926
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,610
Put that chicken back.

927
00:38:35,614 --> 00:38:37,414
I'm sorry,
but no chicken.

928
00:38:37,416 --> 00:38:39,416
One of the reasons you're out
here is to learn how to cook,

929
00:38:39,418 --> 00:38:40,878
and you have to eat
what you cooked.

930
00:38:40,886 --> 00:38:42,486
[Boys groan]
- You second-class candidates

931
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:44,047
get back to your fires.

932
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:45,615
You pup-tent guys
get back to your pup tents.

933
00:38:45,624 --> 00:38:47,324
Everybody get back
to whatever you're doing.

934
00:38:47,326 --> 00:38:48,556
Now, go on.
Hurry up.

935
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,630
- Oh, man!

936
00:38:49,628 --> 00:38:53,658
[Boys complaining]

937
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:55,095
- No chicken!

938
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:03,712
- That was
a lovely exhibition.

939
00:39:03,709 --> 00:39:05,629
- Now, vida, listen--

940
00:39:05,627 --> 00:39:07,537
- a 100% domineering,
"I forbid you,

941
00:39:07,546 --> 00:39:09,106
let's keep them
in their places,"

942
00:39:09,114 --> 00:39:10,684
male performance.
- Male nothing.

943
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:12,722
- You're all alike,
every last one of you--

944
00:39:12,718 --> 00:39:14,918
puffed up,
lords of the universe,

945
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,590
egotistical know-it-alls.

946
00:39:16,588 --> 00:39:17,988
And I thought
you were different!

947
00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:19,659
- Different?
Vida, all I did

948
00:39:19,658 --> 00:39:21,388
was ask you to get rid
of the chicken.

949
00:39:21,393 --> 00:39:22,663
- No, you didn't.

950
00:39:22,661 --> 00:39:26,631
You said, "I forbid you."

951
00:39:26,631 --> 00:39:29,071
- Vida, where you going?

952
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:31,497
Vida, what are you
gonna do?

953
00:39:31,503 --> 00:39:33,673
- I'm obeying military orders.

954
00:39:33,672 --> 00:39:36,512
I'm getting rid
of the chicken.

955
00:39:36,508 --> 00:39:38,438
- Oh, not in the lake.
Vida--

956
00:39:38,443 --> 00:39:40,443
- typical egotistical male.

957
00:39:40,445 --> 00:39:42,675
- Oh, now, don't do that.

958
00:39:42,681 --> 00:39:43,711
Vida.

959
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:45,115
- "I forbid you," he says.

960
00:39:45,117 --> 00:39:47,717
Master of the universe.

961
00:39:49,621 --> 00:39:51,451
- No, no, now, not that.

962
00:39:51,456 --> 00:39:52,656
Not in the lake, vida.

963
00:39:52,657 --> 00:39:54,657
No, no, vida,
don't do it.

964
00:39:54,659 --> 00:39:56,759
- Are you
forbidding me again?

965
00:39:56,762 --> 00:39:59,632
- Well...No, no.

966
00:39:59,631 --> 00:40:00,761
- Good.

967
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:06,970
- Vida.

968
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:08,771
Vida, will you listen
to me, please?

969
00:40:08,774 --> 00:40:10,774
- Will you kindly
get out of my way?

970
00:40:10,776 --> 00:40:12,006
- No, I want
to talk to you.

971
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:13,480
[Pots clatter]
- Oh!

972
00:40:13,478 --> 00:40:14,778
Vida, wait.

973
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:17,510
Where are you going?

974
00:40:17,516 --> 00:40:18,646
- Anywhere where you're not!

975
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:21,050
- Uh, fellas, get back
to your cooking.

976
00:40:21,052 --> 00:40:24,692
Vida, will you cut out
this nonsense?

977
00:40:24,689 --> 00:40:26,159
Now where you going?

978
00:40:26,158 --> 00:40:28,558
- I'm trying to avoid you,
and this seems to be

979
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,790
the only logical way
to do it.

980
00:40:29,795 --> 00:40:34,055
- Well, if that's logical,
I'll go with you.

981
00:40:34,065 --> 00:40:36,625
Vida, you've got
to listen to me.

982
00:40:36,635 --> 00:40:38,145
I'm sorry you got upset

983
00:40:38,152 --> 00:40:39,672
about my not giving
the boys the chicken, but--

984
00:40:39,671 --> 00:40:41,171
- I'm not upset.

985
00:40:41,173 --> 00:40:42,623
Who's upset?

986
00:40:42,618 --> 00:40:44,058
- Well, if you'd just
said something,

987
00:40:44,063 --> 00:40:45,513
I mean, if you told me
you were bringing it, I...

988
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:47,510
- Leo, do you think
the patch is dry yet?

989
00:40:47,512 --> 00:40:48,752
- Will you stop paddling
and listen?

990
00:40:48,747 --> 00:40:50,207
- Uh-uh.

991
00:40:50,215 --> 00:40:51,475
- What do we do?

992
00:40:51,483 --> 00:40:52,723
- If you'd
only said something.

993
00:40:52,717 --> 00:40:53,777
- Watch, I guess.

994
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:55,585
- That's the whole idea.

995
00:40:55,587 --> 00:40:57,687
When they get out in the woods,
they're supposed to know--

996
00:40:57,689 --> 00:40:58,689
hey!
- [Gasps]

997
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:00,690
- Hey, we sprung a leak!

998
00:41:00,692 --> 00:41:02,092
- Aah!

999
00:41:02,093 --> 00:41:04,493
- I thought the boys
we're gonna patch this!

1000
00:41:04,496 --> 00:41:05,596
- Aah!

1001
00:41:05,597 --> 00:41:07,227
- Um...

1002
00:41:07,232 --> 00:41:10,732
- Aah.
- Uh...

1003
00:41:10,735 --> 00:41:12,835
- Aah! Aah!

1004
00:41:31,056 --> 00:41:32,756

1006

- [Laughing]

1007

[Laughing]

1008
00:41:51,276 --> 00:41:53,676
- Oh! Oh!

1009
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:56,778
Oh! I surrender!

1010
00:41:56,781 --> 00:41:57,881
Oh!

1011
00:42:01,152 --> 00:42:05,262
[Cheering]

1012
00:42:10,795 --> 00:42:12,295
- Hold it!

[Door opens and closes]

1014

- Ah, everything's
out of the car.

- [Laughing]

1016
00:42:42,761 --> 00:42:44,161
- What's so funny?

1017
00:42:44,162 --> 00:42:47,202
- Oh, this silly picture.

1018
00:42:47,198 --> 00:42:50,728
- You never looked
lovelier.

1019
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:52,335
- Um, Lem?

1020
00:42:52,337 --> 00:42:54,137
- Okay, we've got
work to do.

1021
00:42:54,139 --> 00:42:55,669
Uh, what's next?

1022
00:42:55,674 --> 00:42:57,814
- Well, let's get these
empty suitcases out of here.

1023
00:42:57,809 --> 00:42:59,339
- Where you want them,
under the bed?

1024
00:42:59,344 --> 00:43:02,714
- No. In the hall closet,
I guess.

1025
00:43:04,716 --> 00:43:06,816
- Boy.
Here, let me do that.

1026
00:43:06,818 --> 00:43:10,348
- No, it's okay,
just set them down.

1027
00:43:10,355 --> 00:43:11,745
- Well, I'll find someplace

1028
00:43:11,756 --> 00:43:13,616
for this stuff of mine
in the morning.

1029
00:43:13,625 --> 00:43:15,355
- Oh, I've already
got a place.

1030
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:17,960
- Oh?
- Right in here.

1031
00:43:17,963 --> 00:43:20,133
- I thought that was supposed
to be the sewing room.

1032
00:43:20,131 --> 00:43:21,361
- Gonna be your study.

1033
00:43:21,366 --> 00:43:23,266
I'm gonna fix it up.

1034
00:43:23,268 --> 00:43:24,868
You're going to have
to build some shelves

1035
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:26,339
for all those law books.

1036
00:43:26,338 --> 00:43:27,518
- Vi?

1037
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:28,712
- And I think
we should splurge

1038
00:43:28,707 --> 00:43:30,667
and get you
a really nice desk.

1039
00:43:30,675 --> 00:43:32,235
- Vi, I guess I forgot
to tell you.

1040
00:43:32,243 --> 00:43:34,783
They're, uh, having
the bar exams next week.

1041
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:35,779
- Really?

1042
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,750
- Yeah, but I'm, uh...

1043
00:43:37,749 --> 00:43:39,749
I'm not going to take it.

1044
00:43:39,751 --> 00:43:40,981
- Oh.

1045
00:43:40,985 --> 00:43:42,215
- It's just that
I'm not ready for it.

1046
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:44,720
I haven't looked
at one of these books in months.

1047
00:43:44,723 --> 00:43:46,723
I've been so busy
with the scouts and the store

1048
00:43:46,725 --> 00:43:49,725
and, uh, other things.

1049
00:43:49,728 --> 00:43:51,158
- Meaning me.

1050
00:43:51,162 --> 00:43:53,302
- Yeah.

1051
00:43:53,298 --> 00:43:54,958
Meaning you.

1052
00:43:59,371 --> 00:44:01,801
Next year the troop
will be organized,

1053
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:04,406
and they can get somebody else
to take over.

1054
00:44:04,409 --> 00:44:06,409
Next year, I promise,
I'll...

1055
00:44:06,411 --> 00:44:07,881
I'll really settle down
to business.

1056
00:44:07,879 --> 00:44:09,179
- Scout's honor?

1057
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:11,010
- Scout's honor.

1058
00:44:11,016 --> 00:44:15,016
[Cornet haltingly playing
 let me call you sweetheart]

We tied knots.

- Isn't this big enough?

on top of the cabin?

where you won't lose it.

1233
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:33,690
- Whitey.

1234
00:51:33,691 --> 00:51:35,691
What's the scout law?

1235
00:51:35,692 --> 00:51:37,692
- A scout is trustworthy,
loyal, helpful, fr--

1236
00:51:40,765 --> 00:51:42,625
aw, forget it.

1237
00:51:42,633 --> 00:51:44,733
- Whitey, why don't you
knock off this tough-guy act?

1238
00:51:44,735 --> 00:51:46,165
The boys all want you.

1239
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:47,840
All you have to do
is come halfway.

1240
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:50,409
- Yeah, I'll bet.

1241
00:51:50,408 --> 00:51:52,368
- You got guts enough
to find out?

1242
00:51:52,376 --> 00:51:54,436
- Hey, Lem!
We're ready!

1243
00:52:10,828 --> 00:52:13,198
- Atten-tion!

1244
00:52:13,197 --> 00:52:14,897
One-gun salute!

1245
00:52:14,899 --> 00:52:16,369
Fire!

1246
00:52:16,367 --> 00:52:18,167
[Bang]

1247
00:52:27,178 --> 00:52:29,308
- Now, Lem, you're
gonna be the first one

1248
00:52:29,313 --> 00:52:30,713
through the front door.

1249
00:52:30,715 --> 00:52:33,315
- Yeah, come on.

1250
00:52:33,317 --> 00:52:34,717
- Look what's inside, man.

1251
00:52:34,719 --> 00:52:36,819
- All you have to do
is give the secret knock,

1252
00:52:36,821 --> 00:52:39,761
like this.

1253
00:52:39,757 --> 00:52:41,157
- Okay.

1254
00:52:41,159 --> 00:52:42,929
[Boards crashing]

1255
00:52:42,927 --> 00:52:44,227
Look out, fellas!

1256
00:52:44,228 --> 00:52:45,528
Get back!

1257
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:46,900
- The whole thing's
coming down!

1258
00:53:02,446 --> 00:53:04,806
[Creaking]

1259
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:13,460
[Sign squeaking]

1260
00:53:22,967 --> 00:53:24,827
- [Chuckles]

1261
00:53:24,835 --> 00:53:28,565
[Laughing]

1262
00:53:30,308 --> 00:53:32,878
[All laughing hysterically]

1263
00:53:40,451 --> 00:53:42,851
I guess one of your knots
must have slipped, huh?

1264
00:53:42,853 --> 00:53:44,553
- Yeah.

1265
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:46,254
- Well, guys, that was
a pretty good practice cabin.

1266
00:53:46,257 --> 00:53:47,887
Now what do you say
we build a real one, huh?

1267
00:53:47,892 --> 00:53:49,432
All: Yeah!

1268
00:53:49,426 --> 00:53:50,956
- All right, let's clear
all that junk out of there.

1269
00:53:50,962 --> 00:53:52,802
Beefy, you take charge
of the clean-up squad.

1270
00:53:52,797 --> 00:53:53,997
Mickey, go over
to the truck

1271
00:53:53,998 --> 00:53:55,998
and get my tools out,
will you?

1272
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,840
Whitey, uh, why don't you
start working on that pump?

1273
00:54:00,838 --> 00:54:01,998
Get everything out of there

1274
00:54:02,006 --> 00:54:03,806
and take it over
to the junk pile, huh?

1275
00:54:05,409 --> 00:54:06,839
Well, I guess, uh,

1276
00:54:06,844 --> 00:54:08,814
everything's gonna
work out all right, Frankie.

1277
00:54:13,784 --> 00:54:16,324
[Laughter and shouting]

1278
00:54:23,628 --> 00:54:25,628
- Hey, whitey,
how long you gonna be?

1279
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:27,030
- I'll be right out.

1280
00:54:27,031 --> 00:54:28,901
She's sewing
my first-class badge on.

1281
00:54:28,899 --> 00:54:30,329
- In the meantime,
I don't have a horse

1282
00:54:30,334 --> 00:54:31,404
for horse and rider.

1283
00:54:31,402 --> 00:54:33,302
- Just a couple of minutes.

1284
00:54:39,844 --> 00:54:41,614
I sure do appreciate this,
Mrs. siddons.

1285
00:54:41,612 --> 00:54:46,322
You know, next year,
I'm going for my merit badges.

1286
00:54:46,317 --> 00:54:47,877
First aid,
that's going on top.

1287
00:54:53,057 --> 00:54:54,457
Thanks.

1288
00:54:55,626 --> 00:54:57,886
My Uncle sid
was a vet,

1289
00:54:57,895 --> 00:54:59,655
but I'm figuring to be
a regular doctor of medicine.

1290
00:55:01,365 --> 00:55:03,465
- [Choked up] I'm sure
you'll be a good one, whitey.

1291
00:55:06,037 --> 00:55:08,597
- You feeling okay,
Mrs. siddons?

1292
00:55:08,606 --> 00:55:10,936
- Yes, I'm fine.

1293
00:55:16,981 --> 00:55:18,051
- How's it look?

1294
00:55:21,619 --> 00:55:23,019
- Looks just grand.

1295
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:25,590
- And after
first-aid merit badge,

1296
00:55:25,589 --> 00:55:27,459
then I'm going
to carpentry.

1297
00:55:27,458 --> 00:55:28,988
- See you later, fellas.

1298
00:55:28,993 --> 00:55:31,333
- Hey, Lem!

1299
00:55:33,331 --> 00:55:34,461
Look!

1300
00:55:34,465 --> 00:55:36,525
- That's fine, whitey.

1301
00:55:40,604 --> 00:55:42,474
Hi, honey.

1302
00:55:44,942 --> 00:55:47,712
- Well, I...Guess the guys
are waiting for me.

1303
00:55:47,712 --> 00:55:49,682
- Oh, whitey?

1304
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,780
- Yes, sir?

1305
00:55:51,781 --> 00:55:53,881
- Your dad came
into the store today.

1306
00:55:53,884 --> 00:55:55,424
I told him I was sorry

1307
00:55:55,419 --> 00:55:56,919
that he, uh, couldn't come
to father's night

1308
00:55:56,921 --> 00:55:57,991
out at the cabin.

1309
00:56:00,358 --> 00:56:01,558
Whitey?

1310
00:56:03,594 --> 00:56:06,084
- Yes, sir?

1311
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:08,559
- You didn't ask him
to come, did you?

1312
00:56:08,566 --> 00:56:10,466
You told me you did
and that he couldn't make it,

1313
00:56:10,468 --> 00:56:13,138
right?

1314
00:56:13,137 --> 00:56:15,037
Whitey?

1315
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:22,712
- Yes, sir.

1316
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:26,383
- Okay.
Run along, whitey.

1317
00:56:27,985 --> 00:56:30,045
Oh, whitey?

1318
00:56:31,922 --> 00:56:34,092
I invited your dad myself.

1319
00:56:34,091 --> 00:56:36,021
He said he'd be there.

1320
00:56:44,635 --> 00:56:46,025
- Well...

1321
00:56:46,036 --> 00:56:48,436
- Lem, you shouldn't
have done that.

1322
00:56:48,439 --> 00:56:50,639
He doesn't want his father
at that meeting.

1323
00:56:50,641 --> 00:56:52,671
- Well, he could have come
and told me, couldn't he?

1324
00:56:52,676 --> 00:56:54,536
- No, he couldn't.

1325
00:56:54,545 --> 00:56:56,055
He's crazy about his father,

1326
00:56:56,062 --> 00:56:57,582
and he's ashamed of him
at the same time.

1327
00:56:57,581 --> 00:56:59,051
Everyone knows
ed is a drunk.

1328
00:56:59,049 --> 00:57:00,549
[Crying]

1329
00:57:00,551 --> 00:57:03,451
- Vi...

1330
00:57:03,454 --> 00:57:04,654
Vi, what's wrong?

1331
00:57:04,655 --> 00:57:06,655
- Well, you just can't expect
a little boy

1332
00:57:06,657 --> 00:57:09,057
to make a laughingstock
out of someone he loves.

1333
00:57:09,059 --> 00:57:10,729
- Honey, I'm not talking
about whitey.

1334
00:57:10,728 --> 00:57:12,878
It's you.

1335
00:57:12,879 --> 00:57:15,029
You've been taking things
so hard these last few weeks.

1336
00:57:15,032 --> 00:57:16,282
I guess that medicine

1337
00:57:16,283 --> 00:57:17,533
Dr. Ferris gave you
for your nerves

1338
00:57:17,535 --> 00:57:19,695
isn't helping much, huh?

1339
00:57:19,703 --> 00:57:21,603
Did you see him today?

1340
00:57:24,742 --> 00:57:25,712
- Yes.

1341
00:57:25,709 --> 00:57:28,779
- Well, what did he say?

1342
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:31,749
- It isn't my nerves.

1343
00:57:31,749 --> 00:57:34,479
Never was.

1344
00:57:34,485 --> 00:57:36,645
I just told you that.

1345
00:57:36,654 --> 00:57:39,724
I lied too.

1346
00:57:39,723 --> 00:57:41,593
- Oh?

1347
00:57:47,064 --> 00:57:49,634
- He's been giving me
a series of tests.

1348
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:57,610
I can't have any children...

1349
00:57:57,608 --> 00:57:59,068
Now or ever.

1350
00:58:02,246 --> 00:58:04,176
- Is he, uh...

1351
00:58:04,181 --> 00:58:05,251
Is he sure?

1352
00:58:08,586 --> 00:58:10,046
- The tests were very thorough.

1353
00:58:16,794 --> 00:58:19,264
- Did he, uh,
just tell you today?

1354
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:21,263
- An hour ago.

1355
00:58:24,535 --> 00:58:26,865
[Crying]
I'm so terribly sorry, Lem.

1356
00:58:26,871 --> 00:58:28,201
I'm so sorry.

1357
00:58:28,205 --> 00:58:32,765
If I'd known
before we were...

1358
00:58:32,776 --> 00:58:34,736
- Honey, you, uh...

1359
00:58:34,745 --> 00:58:36,675
You can just tell
Dr. Ferris that he's wrong.

1360
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:37,850
- Oh, no, Lem, he isn't.

1361
00:58:37,848 --> 00:58:39,278
- Yeah, he's dead wrong.

1362
00:58:39,283 --> 00:58:40,753
[Boys shouting outside]

1363
00:58:40,751 --> 00:58:42,621
- Vida, we can have kids.

1364
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:44,820
Come here.

1365
00:58:46,757 --> 00:58:50,627
We've already got 15 boys.

1366
00:58:50,628 --> 00:58:53,828
That's a pretty good start
when you come to think of it.

1367
00:58:59,770 --> 00:59:03,270
[Shouting]

1368
00:59:08,646 --> 00:59:12,916
[Applause and cheering]

1369
00:59:12,917 --> 00:59:14,717
- Dead heat--
two minutes on the nose.

1370
00:59:14,718 --> 00:59:17,818
That's good, guys.

1371
00:59:17,821 --> 00:59:19,691
Now, uh, the knot-tying.

1372
00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:22,320
I, uh, guess a lot of people
have the idea

1373
00:59:22,326 --> 00:59:25,656
that about the only thing
scouts do is, uh, tie knots.

1374
00:59:25,663 --> 00:59:27,763
Uh, Leo, uh...

1375
00:59:27,765 --> 00:59:28,855
- Come on, Leo!

1376
00:59:28,866 --> 00:59:30,796
[Boys kidding Leo]

1377
00:59:30,801 --> 00:59:32,771
- I'll, uh--I'll
kind of start things off here

1378
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:34,600
by tying a sheepshank.

1379
00:59:34,605 --> 00:59:36,635
Now, a sheepshank is used

1380
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:39,310
if you want to shorten
a piece of rope.

1381
00:59:39,310 --> 00:59:42,740
Now, let's see here, uh...

1382
00:59:42,746 --> 00:59:43,746
No, no.

1383
00:59:43,747 --> 00:59:45,877
[Laughter]

1384
00:59:48,752 --> 00:59:50,952
Uh, well, so much
for the sheepshank.

1385
00:59:50,955 --> 00:59:52,345
[Laughter]

1386
00:59:52,356 --> 00:59:53,816
You know, I never could tie
one of these things

1387
00:59:53,824 --> 00:59:55,324
to save my neck.

1388
00:59:55,326 --> 00:59:57,856
We'll just let Leo demonstrate
the knots, I guess.

1389
00:59:57,861 --> 00:59:59,361
Go ahead, Leo.

1390
00:59:59,363 --> 01:00:00,963
- Slipknot.

1391
01:00:05,636 --> 01:00:06,736
- Hello, Lem.

1392
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:10,740
- Ed.

1393
01:00:10,741 --> 01:00:13,381
- It's all right.
G-go right ahead.

1394
01:00:13,377 --> 01:00:15,737
I-I, uh...

1395
01:00:15,746 --> 01:00:17,776
Just brought the boys
a little ice cream.

1396
01:00:27,825 --> 01:00:29,185
Nothing that kids

1397
01:00:29,193 --> 01:00:31,693
like better than
a little ice cream.

1398
01:00:31,695 --> 01:00:33,295
Oh! Oh!

1399
01:00:34,398 --> 01:00:35,858
Right, Mr. Lee?

1400
01:00:35,866 --> 01:00:36,866
Uh...Uh...

1401
01:00:36,867 --> 01:00:38,727
Don't let me
interrupt, Lem.

1402
01:00:38,736 --> 01:00:42,266
Go--go right ahead.

1403
01:00:42,272 --> 01:00:45,712
Right good old scoutmaster,
lemmy boy, right?

1404
01:00:45,709 --> 01:00:49,749
- Uh, Leo, you were
going to tie a slipknot.

1405
01:00:49,747 --> 01:00:51,227
- Slipknot.

1406
01:00:51,231 --> 01:00:52,711
- Uh...Uh, hold it.
Hold it a second.

1407
01:00:52,716 --> 01:00:54,846
I-I-I think we sprung
a little leak here.

1408
01:00:54,852 --> 01:00:56,752
Yeah. Don't--

1409
01:00:56,754 --> 01:00:58,294
don't you worry, fellas.

1410
01:00:58,288 --> 01:01:01,718
Don't you worry.
We got a reliable plumber here.

1411
01:01:01,725 --> 01:01:03,685
Hey, that's--that's
kind of joke, isn't it?

1412
01:01:03,694 --> 01:01:05,294
Call for a plumber.

1413
01:01:05,295 --> 01:01:06,895
We've sprung
and ice cream leak, huh?

1414
01:01:06,897 --> 01:01:08,297
Right, huh?
Ha ha!

1415
01:01:08,298 --> 01:01:10,428
Oh!
[Loud thud]

1416
01:01:10,434 --> 01:01:13,904
- Get your hands off him!
Let him be!

1417
01:01:15,906 --> 01:01:19,876
- I just brought the boys
a little ice cream. I...

1418
01:01:19,877 --> 01:01:21,777
- I know, pa.

1419
01:01:21,779 --> 01:01:22,909
Come on.

1420
01:01:22,913 --> 01:01:25,353
- Well, where
are we going, whitey?

1421
01:01:25,349 --> 01:01:27,679
Uh, meeting
is just starting, ain't it?

1422
01:01:27,685 --> 01:01:28,675
Huh?

1423
01:01:28,686 --> 01:01:30,046
- I know, pa.
I know.

1424
01:01:34,324 --> 01:01:35,724
- Frankie, take over,
will you?

1425
01:01:35,726 --> 01:01:36,786
Uh, keep things going?

1426
01:01:36,794 --> 01:01:38,364
- Sure.

1427
01:01:41,699 --> 01:01:43,029
- Ah, whitey, whitey.

1428
01:01:43,033 --> 01:01:44,403
Your father's a...

1429
01:01:44,401 --> 01:01:45,471
Your father's a bum.

1430
01:01:45,469 --> 01:01:48,739
Real, no-good bum.

1431
01:01:48,739 --> 01:01:51,009
Right?

1432
01:01:59,817 --> 01:02:01,477
Right.

1433
01:02:01,485 --> 01:02:03,285
- Forget it, pa.

1434
01:02:04,722 --> 01:02:05,792
- Whitey.

1435
01:02:07,357 --> 01:02:08,957
I'll drive you home.

1436
01:02:08,959 --> 01:02:10,429
- You leave us alone.

1437
01:02:10,427 --> 01:02:12,727
It was your idea,
bringing him out to the meeting.

1438
01:02:12,730 --> 01:02:13,500
- I know, whitey.

1439
01:02:13,497 --> 01:02:15,257
I'm sorry.
I was wrong.

1440
01:02:15,265 --> 01:02:16,425
- All right, all right,
you were wrong!

1441
01:02:16,433 --> 01:02:18,503
I'm wrong! He's wrong!
Everybody's wrong!

1442
01:02:18,502 --> 01:02:20,402
- Easy, whitey.
Easy.

1443
01:02:20,404 --> 01:02:23,274
Respect your elders,
remember?

1444
01:02:23,273 --> 01:02:24,873
He's just a little upset.

1445
01:02:24,875 --> 01:02:25,865
- Come on, pa.

1446
01:02:25,876 --> 01:02:28,276
Let's go home.

1447
01:02:28,278 --> 01:02:29,308
- Good night, Lem.

1448
01:02:29,313 --> 01:02:31,053
- Good night, ed.

1449
01:02:32,516 --> 01:02:33,846
I can walk, whitey.

1450
01:02:33,851 --> 01:02:35,781
I can walk real fine.

1451
01:02:59,543 --> 01:03:02,883
- I really messed the whole
thing up good, didn't I?

1452
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:06,410
And I thought
I knew so much.

1453
01:03:06,416 --> 01:03:08,546
- Come to bed, Lem.

1454
01:03:08,552 --> 01:03:10,552
- Well, I'm gonna call
the troop committee.

1455
01:03:10,554 --> 01:03:12,524
They can get somebody else.

1456
01:03:12,523 --> 01:03:14,563
Somebody who'll do
a better job than I've done.

1457
01:03:14,558 --> 01:03:16,118
- Oh, now,
that's nonsense, Lem.

1458
01:03:16,126 --> 01:03:18,426
Every boy in that troop
thinks the sun rises with you,

1459
01:03:18,428 --> 01:03:19,858
including whitey.

1460
01:03:19,863 --> 01:03:21,433
- Yeah, well, I'm gonna
give the whole thing up,

1461
01:03:21,431 --> 01:03:22,461
get back to my law books.

1462
01:03:22,466 --> 01:03:24,826
- Mrs. siddons!
Mrs. siddons!

1463
01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:28,400
Mrs. siddons, there's
something the matter with pa!

1464
01:03:28,405 --> 01:03:30,405
He fell on the floor,
and he can't get up!

1465
01:03:30,407 --> 01:03:31,657
Please, Mrs. siddons,

1466
01:03:31,658 --> 01:03:32,908
I got to use your phone
for the doctor!

1467
01:03:32,910 --> 01:03:35,810
- I'll come right down
and open the door.

1468
01:04:11,982 --> 01:04:14,122
- We'll wait
for the ambulance,

1469
01:04:14,117 --> 01:04:17,187
but I don't think
it's gonna do any good.

1470
01:04:17,187 --> 01:04:18,887
All that booze--

1471
01:04:18,889 --> 01:04:22,089
I warned him a year ago
about his heart.

1472
01:04:22,092 --> 01:04:23,462
- What about the boy?

1473
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:24,930
- Now, that's
gonna be a problem.

1474
01:04:24,928 --> 01:04:27,428
- We'll take him in
with us tonight.

1475
01:04:27,431 --> 01:04:29,131
- Nobody's taking me anyplace!

1476
01:04:29,132 --> 01:04:31,902
Pa's gonna be all right!

1477
01:04:31,902 --> 01:04:33,542
- [Strained]
Whitey.

1478
01:04:47,017 --> 01:04:49,887
[Siren wailing]

1479
01:04:49,887 --> 01:04:51,147
- [Crying]

1480
01:04:56,593 --> 01:05:00,063
[Siren slows and stops]

1481
01:05:09,139 --> 01:05:12,539
- Vi?

1482
01:05:12,542 --> 01:05:15,282
Why don't we decide
right now?

1483
01:05:15,279 --> 01:05:17,179
After all, we've got
16 kids already.

1484
01:05:17,180 --> 01:05:20,620
The only difference is
this one would sleep in.

1485
01:05:20,617 --> 01:05:22,577
- Are you sure
you really want him, Lem?

1486
01:05:22,586 --> 01:05:23,946
- I'm sure.

1487
01:05:23,954 --> 01:05:25,154
How about you?

1488
01:05:25,155 --> 01:05:26,685
- I'm sure.

1489
01:05:26,690 --> 01:05:28,620
- Okay,
then it's all settled.

1490
01:05:32,562 --> 01:05:34,162
- Will you tell him?

1491
01:05:34,164 --> 01:05:35,604
- Yeah, I'll tell him.

1492
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:39,100
Hey, uh, coffee
for a kid his age?

1493
01:05:39,102 --> 01:05:40,602
- Just for tonight.

1494
01:05:46,576 --> 01:05:48,936
Come have
a bite to eat.

1495
01:05:48,946 --> 01:05:50,546
- I'm not hungry.

1496
01:06:00,624 --> 01:06:01,694
- Whitey...

1497
01:06:03,193 --> 01:06:06,703
There's something we'd like
to talk to you about.

1498
01:06:06,697 --> 01:06:08,627
How would you like
to live here with us?

1499
01:06:08,632 --> 01:06:10,202
- I don't want to be
any charity case!

1500
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:12,180
- Whitey.

1501
01:06:12,185 --> 01:06:14,165
- I ain't gonna live here,
and you can't make me!

1502
01:06:14,171 --> 01:06:16,241
- Whitey, sit down, hmm?

1503
01:06:16,239 --> 01:06:17,609
- You're just doing
your boy scout duty.

1504
01:06:17,607 --> 01:06:19,507
Well, I don't need
that kind of stuff.

1505
01:06:19,509 --> 01:06:20,929
I can earn my own living.

1506
01:06:20,927 --> 01:06:22,337
I don't need you!
I don't need anybody!

1507
01:06:22,346 --> 01:06:23,606
- Whitey, now, you sit down,

1508
01:06:23,613 --> 01:06:24,983
or I'm gonna have to
clout you one.

1509
01:06:24,982 --> 01:06:26,552
- Oh, Lem, don't talk
to him like that.

1510
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:27,980
- Vi, I'll handle it.
- Come on, Dutch!

1511
01:06:27,985 --> 01:06:29,545
- Whitey, now,
you listen to me.

1512
01:06:29,553 --> 01:06:32,023
We want you
to live here with us.

1513
01:06:32,022 --> 01:06:34,292
No duty,
no boy scout stuff.

1514
01:06:34,291 --> 01:06:36,661
We don't have a kid of our own,
and we want one.

1515
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:38,230
Sometimes
you're no great shakes,

1516
01:06:38,228 --> 01:06:40,628
but we both love you, whitey,

1517
01:06:40,630 --> 01:06:42,760
and we need you,

1518
01:06:42,766 --> 01:06:45,626
and you need us.

1519
01:06:45,635 --> 01:06:48,665
Can you get that through
that thick head of yours?

1520
01:06:52,676 --> 01:06:55,106
- We have a room
for you, whitey.

1521
01:06:55,112 --> 01:06:56,782
Won't you come
look at it?

1522
01:07:35,619 --> 01:07:37,689
- We'll, uh, clear
all my stuff out of here

1523
01:07:37,687 --> 01:07:39,817
over the weekend.

1524
01:07:39,823 --> 01:07:42,293
Uh, I'll leave
my old saxophone here

1525
01:07:42,292 --> 01:07:44,392
just in case you might
want to blow it sometime.

1526
01:07:44,394 --> 01:07:47,434
We'll make that
part of the deal, huh?

1527
01:07:51,835 --> 01:07:53,695
You'll have to sleep
on the couch a night or two

1528
01:07:53,703 --> 01:07:56,243
until we get
a bed in here.

1529
01:07:58,075 --> 01:08:00,235
It'll be
your room, whitey.

1530
01:08:00,243 --> 01:08:02,083
If you want to be alone,
you just shut the door,

1531
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:04,649
and nobody'll bother you.

1532
01:08:07,317 --> 01:08:09,077
Um...

1533
01:08:09,086 --> 01:08:11,446
I'll go get a pillow
and some blankets.

1534
01:08:26,236 --> 01:08:28,696
- Won't you give us
a chance, whitey?

1535
01:08:56,233 --> 01:08:57,673
- I wouldn't knock on it
too hard.

1536
01:08:57,667 --> 01:09:01,467
The whole thing's
liable to come down on you.

1537
01:09:01,471 --> 01:09:03,471
- Does aunt Hetty know
about all of this?

1538
01:09:03,473 --> 01:09:04,773
- Oh, yeah, she knows.

1539
01:09:04,774 --> 01:09:06,174
She was out here Sunday.

1540
01:09:06,176 --> 01:09:07,376
As a matter of fact,

1541
01:09:07,377 --> 01:09:09,477
she, uh, wanted to know
if it'd be all right

1542
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:10,749
if she just sat here
on the steps

1543
01:09:10,747 --> 01:09:12,407
and looked out at the lake
for a while.

1544
01:09:12,415 --> 01:09:15,215
- Sometimes I worry
about aunt Hetty.

1545
01:09:15,218 --> 01:09:17,348
She has
some very peculiar notions

1546
01:09:17,354 --> 01:09:20,864
about this place.

1547
01:09:20,857 --> 01:09:25,157
Lem, do you know how much
this lake property is worth?

1548
01:09:25,162 --> 01:09:28,802
- Well, I guess I never, uh,
thought of it in terms of money.

1549
01:09:28,798 --> 01:09:32,168
- Properly developed,
at least half a million.

1550
01:09:32,169 --> 01:09:33,769
- Half a million, huh?

1551
01:09:33,770 --> 01:09:37,240
- At least.

1552
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:40,880
Yes, a valuable piece
of property, Lem.

1553
01:09:40,877 --> 01:09:43,507
- We'll try to take good care
of it for you, Ralph.

1554
01:09:43,513 --> 01:09:45,713
- For me?

1555
01:09:45,715 --> 01:09:47,945
- I imagine it will be yours
someday, won't it?

1556
01:09:47,951 --> 01:09:50,751
- Oh, I imagine it will...

1557
01:09:50,754 --> 01:09:51,824
Someday.

1558
01:09:53,723 --> 01:09:56,363
Well, I'd better be
getting back.

1559
01:09:56,359 --> 01:09:57,829
By the way, Lem,
I, uh...

1560
01:09:57,827 --> 01:09:59,287
I thought you'd be off
hiking this morning.

1561
01:09:59,296 --> 01:10:01,826
- I thought I'd leave
the hiking to the boys today.

1562
01:10:01,831 --> 01:10:03,301
Whitey and a couple
of the fellas

1563
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:04,900
are taking the tenderfoot patrol
up the Mountain.

1564
01:10:04,901 --> 01:10:05,901
- Whitey?

1565
01:10:05,902 --> 01:10:07,202
- Yeah.

1566
01:10:07,204 --> 01:10:08,974
He just made patrol leader.

1567
01:10:08,972 --> 01:10:10,642
- With his background,

1568
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:12,310
I'd hardly have thought
he was the caliber to--

1569
01:10:12,309 --> 01:10:15,739
- Ralph, whitey
is loaded with caliber.

1570
01:10:15,745 --> 01:10:19,575
- Well, I just hope
he never disappoints you, Lem.

1571
01:10:25,422 --> 01:10:27,492
- Easy.
Easy, now.

1572
01:10:27,490 --> 01:10:28,560
[Grunts]

1573
01:10:31,895 --> 01:10:33,555
- Hurry up, whitey!

1574
01:10:33,563 --> 01:10:35,263
I'm scared!

1575
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:44,570
- Hold it there!
- Hold it!

1576
01:10:46,509 --> 01:10:47,779
- What are you doing?

1577
01:10:47,777 --> 01:10:49,277
- I just kicked
some dirt loose.

1578
01:10:49,279 --> 01:10:50,879
Now, you're gonna be
all right.

1579
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,950
I'm coming after you.

1580
01:10:52,949 --> 01:10:53,949
Just don't panic.

1581
01:10:53,950 --> 01:10:55,380
- Hurry up, whitey.

1582
01:10:55,385 --> 01:10:57,985
- I'm coming, Ronnie!
I'm coming!

1583
01:10:57,988 --> 01:10:59,018
Let it out easy!

1584
01:10:59,022 --> 01:11:00,562
- Let it out easy,
hoodoo!

1585
01:11:00,557 --> 01:11:02,017
Nice and easy.

1586
01:11:02,025 --> 01:11:03,455
- Yeah, come on, you guys.

1587
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:04,790
Let it out easy.

1588
01:11:04,794 --> 01:11:06,394
- [Whines]

1589
01:11:10,533 --> 01:11:11,873
- Is whitey all right?

1590
01:11:11,868 --> 01:11:13,418
- Yeah.

1591
01:11:13,419 --> 01:11:14,969
Boy, if we get that goof-off
Ronnie out of there,

1592
01:11:14,971 --> 01:11:16,301
I'm gonna break his neck.

1593
01:11:16,306 --> 01:11:17,466
- Big show-off.

1594
01:11:17,474 --> 01:11:19,514
Had to go waltzing
on the edge.

1595
01:11:19,509 --> 01:11:22,379
Whitey told him
a dozen times.

1596
01:11:22,379 --> 01:11:23,439
- Easy, hoodoo!

1597
01:11:23,446 --> 01:11:24,606
Let it out easy.

1598
01:11:24,614 --> 01:11:25,914
You okay, whitey?

1599
01:11:25,915 --> 01:11:28,475
- Yeah! Just a couple
of feet more!

1600
01:11:28,485 --> 01:11:30,285
- Just a couple more feet.

1601
01:11:34,924 --> 01:11:35,964
- Okay! Hold it there!

1602
01:11:35,959 --> 01:11:36,959
- Hold it!

1603
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:38,490
- Get back!

1604
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:40,655
I'm gonna try
to swing over!

1605
01:11:40,664 --> 01:11:41,864
- Closer!

1606
01:11:41,865 --> 01:11:43,925
- Get back, ya dope!
Give me room!

1607
01:11:43,933 --> 01:11:46,333
Give me room!

1608
01:11:46,336 --> 01:11:47,536
- No! No!

1609
01:11:47,537 --> 01:11:48,867
- No, Ronnie, let go!

1610
01:11:48,872 --> 01:11:50,442
Let go!

1611
01:11:51,474 --> 01:11:54,384
[Dog barking]

1612
01:11:56,079 --> 01:11:58,549
[Whitey straining]

1613
01:11:58,548 --> 01:11:59,978
- Come on, whitey.

1614
01:11:59,983 --> 01:12:01,983
[Dog barking]

1615
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:05,520
Slack off!
Slack off!

1616
01:12:05,522 --> 01:12:07,462
- Give him slack, quick!

1617
01:12:09,893 --> 01:12:11,033
He made it!

1618
01:12:11,027 --> 01:12:14,627
- [Panting]

1619
01:12:22,339 --> 01:12:24,509
Okay.

1620
01:12:24,507 --> 01:12:27,007
Everything's okay, Ronnie.

1621
01:12:27,010 --> 01:12:28,510
Just let me tie this
around your waist.

1622
01:12:28,511 --> 01:12:29,981
- No!

1623
01:12:29,979 --> 01:12:31,979
- Ronnie, get up.

1624
01:12:31,981 --> 01:12:34,581
- I can't!
I'm scared!

1625
01:12:34,584 --> 01:12:37,124
- Come on, Ronnie!

1626
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:38,650
Now stand up!

1627
01:12:46,596 --> 01:12:49,596
You're gonna be
all right, Ronnie.

1628
01:12:49,599 --> 01:12:50,999
You're safe now.

1629
01:12:53,737 --> 01:12:56,037
The guys'll have you up
on top in no time,

1630
01:12:56,039 --> 01:12:57,509
honest.

1631
01:12:57,507 --> 01:12:59,067
[Dog whines]

1632
01:13:01,945 --> 01:13:03,605
- Okay, guys, get ready
to pull him up!

1633
01:13:03,613 --> 01:13:05,953
- Okay, get ready
to pull him up.

1634
01:13:05,949 --> 01:13:08,379
- Now just hold on tight,

1635
01:13:08,385 --> 01:13:09,545
don't look down.

1636
01:13:12,422 --> 01:13:14,062
Don't look down!

1637
01:13:16,693 --> 01:13:18,563
Okay.

1638
01:13:18,561 --> 01:13:19,561
Pull him up.

1639
01:13:19,562 --> 01:13:21,132
- Pull, guys!
Pull!

1640
01:13:21,131 --> 01:13:22,561
Pull, hoodoo!

1641
01:13:25,135 --> 01:13:26,595
Pull.

1642
01:13:30,106 --> 01:13:31,566
Pull!

1643
01:13:32,609 --> 01:13:34,639
- Come on, you guys!
Pull hard! Pull!

1644
01:13:35,612 --> 01:13:37,952
- Pull, guys!
Pull!

1645
01:13:37,947 --> 01:13:39,747
- You're gonna be
all right, Ronnie!

1646
01:13:39,749 --> 01:13:41,119
Don't look down!

1647
01:13:41,116 --> 01:13:42,476
- As soon as we get him
up here, whitey,

1648
01:13:42,485 --> 01:13:44,585
we'll drop the rope
for you!

1649
01:13:44,587 --> 01:13:45,987
- Yeah.

1650
01:13:49,192 --> 01:13:50,632
You do that.

1651
01:13:52,695 --> 01:13:55,525
- You're quite right,
Mrs. Larsen.

1652
01:13:55,532 --> 01:13:58,432
In my opin--

1653
01:13:58,435 --> 01:14:00,695
exactly, Mrs. Larsen.

1654
01:14:00,703 --> 01:14:03,143
I quite agree with you.

1655
01:14:03,139 --> 01:14:05,069
We certainly will,
Mrs. Larsen.

1656
01:14:05,074 --> 01:14:07,614
We'll get
to the bottom of it,

1657
01:14:07,610 --> 01:14:09,660
and, uh...

1658
01:14:09,661 --> 01:14:11,711
I hope that Ronnie
feels better today.

1659
01:14:11,714 --> 01:14:13,114
Good-bye.

1660
01:14:13,116 --> 01:14:15,516
Good morning, aunt Hetty.
That was Mrs. Larsen.

1661
01:14:15,518 --> 01:14:17,148
I suppose you've heard
about Ronnie.

1662
01:14:17,153 --> 01:14:18,523
- Of course I've heard.

1663
01:14:18,521 --> 01:14:20,191
The whole thing's a disgrace.

1664
01:14:20,190 --> 01:14:21,820
The boy wasn't hurt.

1665
01:14:21,825 --> 01:14:23,515
He was just frightened.

1666
01:14:23,526 --> 01:14:24,726
- Aunt Hetty,
everyone can hear you.

1667
01:14:24,727 --> 01:14:26,757
- Well, let them.

1668
01:14:26,762 --> 01:14:28,802
It's outrageous the way
this town is gossiping.

1669
01:14:28,798 --> 01:14:31,168
I don't want to sit down.
Aren't you taking me to lunch?

1670
01:14:31,167 --> 01:14:33,097
- Yes, of course,
aunt Hetty.

1671
01:14:33,102 --> 01:14:37,102
But I would hardly
call it gossip.

1672
01:14:37,106 --> 01:14:39,136
Lem did give the patrol
to a boy

1673
01:14:39,142 --> 01:14:40,682
whose record
as a delinquent--

1674
01:14:40,677 --> 01:14:42,607
- well, if it hadn't been
for that delinquent

1675
01:14:42,612 --> 01:14:44,682
keeping his head
in an emergency

1676
01:14:44,681 --> 01:14:46,051
and risking his own life,

1677
01:14:46,049 --> 01:14:47,779
there might have been
real trouble.

1678
01:14:47,784 --> 01:14:49,084
- Yes, aunt Hetty.

1679
01:14:49,085 --> 01:14:51,585
Where would you like
to have lunch?

1680
01:14:51,588 --> 01:14:53,088
- I've decided to eat alone.

1681
01:14:53,089 --> 01:14:55,619
- Aunt Hetty!

1682
01:14:55,625 --> 01:14:58,125
- Gossip, that's all
anyone ever does--

1683
01:14:58,127 --> 01:15:00,087
gossip.

1684
01:15:09,873 --> 01:15:12,843
- Here, you better take this.

1685
01:15:12,842 --> 01:15:15,142
- It's your new compass.
You crazy?

1686
01:15:15,144 --> 01:15:16,644
- Well, suppose
you're somewhere,

1687
01:15:16,646 --> 01:15:18,146
you want to know
where it is.

1688
01:15:18,147 --> 01:15:19,647
You'll need it.
- Leo.

1689
01:15:19,649 --> 01:15:23,749
- Don't be a dolt.
Take it.

1690
01:15:23,753 --> 01:15:26,123
- Okay.

1691
01:15:26,122 --> 01:15:28,122
Thanks, Leo.

1692
01:15:28,124 --> 01:15:29,894
- You'll need a pup tent.

1693
01:15:29,893 --> 01:15:31,563
- Pick mine up
out at the cabin.

1694
01:15:31,561 --> 01:15:33,861
- Well, what about money?

1695
01:15:33,863 --> 01:15:36,733
- I'll get a job,
plumber's helper or something.

1696
01:15:36,733 --> 01:15:38,833
I used to work with pa.

1697
01:15:52,682 --> 01:15:55,182
- Whitey.
- Yeah?

1698
01:15:55,184 --> 01:15:57,004
- I'd go with you,

1699
01:15:57,002 --> 01:15:58,822
only I got an appointment
with the eye doctor Monday.

1700
01:15:58,821 --> 01:16:02,621
- That's okay.

1701
01:16:02,625 --> 01:16:05,555
Thanks anyway.

1702
01:16:05,562 --> 01:16:07,802
- I'll go with you, whitey.
I got no appointments.

1703
01:16:07,797 --> 01:16:09,797
- Take over the patrol, Leo.

1704
01:16:09,799 --> 01:16:12,269
See these guys shape up,
you hear?

1705
01:16:19,309 --> 01:16:23,139
Well, Leo, see you.

1706
01:16:23,146 --> 01:16:25,846
- See you.

1707
01:16:25,848 --> 01:16:27,278
- Hoodoo.

1708
01:16:27,283 --> 01:16:28,723
- Yeah.

1709
01:16:28,718 --> 01:16:30,618
- Now don't you go bawling.

1710
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:32,250
- Bawling?
Why would I go bawling?

1711
01:16:32,255 --> 01:16:35,185
I'm 13 years old.

1712
01:16:35,191 --> 01:16:37,261
- Yeah.

1713
01:16:45,802 --> 01:16:47,232
- You on the roof okay, whitey?

1714
01:16:47,236 --> 01:16:49,366
- Yeah.

1715
01:16:49,372 --> 01:16:51,272
Here, Dutch.

1716
01:17:21,237 --> 01:17:22,697
- That you, Lem?

1717
01:17:22,705 --> 01:17:24,705
- Yeah, it's me.

1718
01:17:24,707 --> 01:17:26,867
Oh, hi, fellas.

1719
01:17:26,876 --> 01:17:29,406
Were you up with whitey?

1720
01:17:29,412 --> 01:17:30,882
- Uh...

1721
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:33,680
- Yeah, Lem.
We were up there with him.

1722
01:17:33,683 --> 01:17:35,823
Come on, hoodoo.

1723
01:17:44,293 --> 01:17:46,363
- Hi.
- Hello.

1724
01:17:48,731 --> 01:17:51,301
- We're having cold supper.
Be in ten minutes.

1725
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:54,700
- Fine.

1726
01:17:54,704 --> 01:17:56,304
- The whole town still talking?

1727
01:17:56,305 --> 01:17:58,905
- No, they've stopped talking.
Now they're acting.

1728
01:17:58,908 --> 01:18:00,738
Two ladies
came in the store today

1729
01:18:00,743 --> 01:18:02,683
and decided that Mr. Hughes
could wait on them

1730
01:18:02,679 --> 01:18:04,309
a lot better than I could.

1731
01:18:04,313 --> 01:18:06,353
- Well, this
is a small town, Lem.

1732
01:18:06,349 --> 01:18:07,949
These gossip storms pass.

1733
01:18:07,950 --> 01:18:09,780
- But what right have they got
to stand in corners

1734
01:18:09,786 --> 01:18:11,746
and whisper
about that boy?

1735
01:18:11,754 --> 01:18:13,794
Well, I've had enough.

1736
01:18:13,790 --> 01:18:16,320
So his old man was a drunk.
What's that got to--

1737
01:18:16,325 --> 01:18:17,855
378, please.

1738
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:19,730
- This will all blow over,
believe me.

1739
01:18:19,729 --> 01:18:21,329
- Vida, I'm not waiting
for it to blow over.

1740
01:18:21,330 --> 01:18:23,900
I'm calling hi plummer,
and I'm going--

1741
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:25,430
hello, hi.
This is Lem siddons.

1742
01:18:25,435 --> 01:18:26,725
I'm calling to tell you

1743
01:18:26,736 --> 01:18:28,336
there won't be
a scout meeting tonight.

1744
01:18:28,337 --> 01:18:30,397
I'm resigning.
- Lem, you can't do that.

1745
01:18:30,406 --> 01:18:32,236
- That's what my wife
just said, hi.

1746
01:18:32,241 --> 01:18:34,441
But you're both wrong.
I can, and I do.

1747
01:18:34,444 --> 01:18:36,244
And you'll have it in writing
first thing in the morning.

1748
01:18:36,245 --> 01:18:37,805
- Lem, please don't.

1749
01:18:37,814 --> 01:18:39,854
- I'm sorry, hi.
There's nothing to talk over.

1750
01:18:39,849 --> 01:18:42,049
I'll see you tomorrow.

1751
01:18:42,051 --> 01:18:43,481
The boy isn't going
to take a beating

1752
01:18:43,486 --> 01:18:45,716
from brainless gossip
if I can help it.

1753
01:18:45,722 --> 01:18:47,892

with whitey.

Where do you think
you're going?

1756
01:19:10,747 --> 01:19:12,007
- How'd you know
I was here?

1757
01:19:12,014 --> 01:19:13,984
- Well, it wasn't hard.

1758
01:19:13,983 --> 01:19:15,383
I figured
if you were taking off,

1759
01:19:15,384 --> 01:19:16,884
you might want
some of your camping stuff.

1760
01:19:26,529 --> 01:19:28,399
You were just going to leave

1761
01:19:28,397 --> 01:19:30,827
without a word
to vida and me?

1762
01:19:33,770 --> 01:19:36,770
Oh, whitey.

1763
01:19:36,773 --> 01:19:39,113
You want to know something?

1764
01:19:39,108 --> 01:19:41,278
This is just the same
kind of bullheaded stunt

1765
01:19:41,277 --> 01:19:42,877
I used to pull
when I was a kid--

1766
01:19:42,879 --> 01:19:44,509
take off, run away.

1767
01:19:44,514 --> 01:19:47,784
Thought that
would solve everything.

1768
01:19:47,784 --> 01:19:49,354
I can tell you
it never does, whitey.

1769
01:19:53,322 --> 01:19:55,992
You've got responsibilities.

1770
01:19:55,992 --> 01:19:59,562
You've got a couple of people
who need you very much.

1771
01:20:03,065 --> 01:20:05,065
This whole thing
will blow over.

1772
01:20:05,067 --> 01:20:06,427
I gave them my resignation.

1773
01:20:06,435 --> 01:20:09,795
That's all
the town wants, really.

1774
01:20:09,806 --> 01:20:11,566
- You can't quit, Lem.

1775
01:20:11,574 --> 01:20:13,444
- Why not?

1776
01:20:13,442 --> 01:20:16,912
- Well, because like you said,
it wouldn't solve anything.

1777
01:20:16,913 --> 01:20:18,813
- Well, now just a second.
It's different with me.

1778
01:20:18,815 --> 01:20:20,105
- How?

1779

- Well, it's just different,
that's all.

1780

you got worse.

around here?

- Lem, you can't quit!

1785

There wouldn't even be
a scout troop without you.

- Whitey.

1787
01:20:38,067 --> 01:20:39,567
- You just can't quit,
that's all.

1788
01:20:39,569 --> 01:20:41,039
- Now, just take it easy, huh?

1789

1800

- Well, sir, I called in
some reinforcements

to get you
to change your mind.

you're a little late, hi.

- Oh, come on, now, Lem.
Don't say that.

1806

- Well, you see,
whitey and I decided

1807
01:21:35,925 --> 01:21:38,255
just a couple of minutes ago
that I'd withdraw

01:23:04,613 --> 01:23:06,253
- hi, Lem.
Time for reveille?

1825
01:23:06,248 --> 01:23:08,118
- Shh.
 Reveille, tiger?

1826
01:23:08,117 --> 01:23:10,147
They only saw the taps
about ten minutes ago.

1827

- Well, I got to be ready
for reveille

1828
01:23:11,721 --> 01:23:13,721
so I can fire the Cannon
when they raise the flag.

1829
01:23:13,723 --> 01:23:15,223
That's my job, 6:00.

1830

- I know, tiger.

01:23:16,625 --> 01:23:18,555
Right now your job
is to get some sleep.

1832

You got to be tired.

1833
01:23:19,962 --> 01:23:21,362
After all, you guys hiked
all the way from seibert lake

That's almost 12 Miles.

- And you didn't have
to carry me once.

- No, not once, tiger.

I'll be a good soldier,

in the medical corps.

- When I'm old enough
to enlist...

1844
01:23:36,112 --> 01:23:37,242
- Well, you're never going
to be old enough

1845
01:23:37,246 --> 01:23:38,606
if you don't get some sleep.

1846
01:23:38,614 --> 01:23:39,654
Now, come on,
lie down there.

on my hand grenades.

- Some transportation.

hears about this.

- Hey, sergeant,
if we're in the blue zone,

1863
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:46,350
that means the games
have started already, huh?

1864
01:24:46,348 --> 01:24:49,318
- Games! Oh, goody,
we're gonna play games.

1865

- This ain't no game, soldier.

when they meet the enemy.

1869
01:24:56,258 --> 01:24:58,088
We're gonna simulate war.

- What's simulate?

1871
01:25:00,196 --> 01:25:03,156
- Sort of making out,
like with play-acting.

1872
01:25:03,165 --> 01:25:04,355
We make out like
we're shooting the enemy

our heads blown off.

and smoke bombs like that.

Everything's fake.
That right, sarge?

01:27:54,403 --> 01:27:55,943
I'm a civilian,
and this whole thing

1924
01:27:55,938 --> 01:27:57,438
is one big cockeyed mistake.

1925
01:27:57,439 --> 01:27:58,569
- Where was he taken?

1926
01:27:58,574 --> 01:28:00,444
- Behind our lines, sir.

1927
01:28:00,442 --> 01:28:02,312
- Lieutenant, I can explain
this whole thing very simply.

1928
01:28:02,311 --> 01:28:04,381
I was down at the creek,
and I was starting to shave--

1929
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:06,310
- we removed these
from the prisoner

1930
01:28:06,315 --> 01:28:09,045
when we searched him, sir--
compass, signaling device.

1931
01:28:09,051 --> 01:28:10,651
- Signal--
that's my shaving mirror.

1932
01:28:10,653 --> 01:28:12,053
- Tactical map.

1933
01:28:12,054 --> 01:28:13,494
- That's a topographical map.

1934
01:28:13,489 --> 01:28:15,059
My scouts haven't been
in this area before,

1935
01:28:15,057 --> 01:28:17,517
and that is an official
boy scout compass.

1936
01:28:17,526 --> 01:28:19,386
And those binoculars,
believe it or not,

1937
01:28:19,395 --> 01:28:21,455
are for watching birds.

1938
01:28:21,463 --> 01:28:24,003
- For watching birds?

1939
01:28:23,999 --> 01:28:25,929
- That's right.

1940
01:28:25,934 --> 01:28:28,974
- Very clever.

1941
01:28:28,971 --> 01:28:30,941
And you're a scoutmaster?

1942
01:28:30,939 --> 01:28:32,469
- That's right!

1943
01:28:40,949 --> 01:28:43,349
- Tie a sheepshank.

1944
01:28:43,352 --> 01:28:45,092
- A sheepshank.

1945
01:28:45,087 --> 01:28:47,587
- Sheepshank.

1946
01:28:47,589 --> 01:28:49,019
- Lieutenant,
I'll level with you.

1947
01:28:49,024 --> 01:28:50,494
The sheepshank is one knot
I've never been able

1948
01:28:50,492 --> 01:28:51,992
to tie very well.

1949
01:28:51,994 --> 01:28:53,464
Would you settle
for a square knot

1950
01:28:53,462 --> 01:28:54,962
or maybe a bowline?

1951
01:28:54,963 --> 01:28:56,463
- Prepare this prisoner
for tactical interrogation.

1952
01:28:56,465 --> 01:28:57,955
- Tactical interrogation?

1953
01:28:57,966 --> 01:29:00,426
Lieutenant, this may be
some kind of war game

1954
01:29:00,436 --> 01:29:02,596
with you fellas, but I've got
a scout troop out there.

1955
01:29:02,604 --> 01:29:04,674
- Process this man
and transfer him to command

1956
01:29:04,673 --> 01:29:06,443
along with
the other prisoners.

1957
01:29:06,442 --> 01:29:08,482
- We haven't taken
any other prisoners, sir.

1958
01:29:08,477 --> 01:29:10,707
- That's an order, sergeant.

1959
01:29:10,713 --> 01:29:13,883
- Yes, sir.

1960
01:29:13,882 --> 01:29:15,952
- Uh...

1961
01:29:18,120 --> 01:29:20,650
- Carry on, men.

1962
01:29:22,624 --> 01:29:25,434
- Shouldn't we wait for Lem?
- Has anybody seen him?

1963
01:29:25,427 --> 01:29:26,927
- He's probably down
by the creek washing up,

1964
01:29:26,929 --> 01:29:29,659
but he'd want us to go ahead
right on time.

1965
01:29:29,665 --> 01:29:31,095
- So raise the flag.
I'm hungry.

1966
01:29:31,100 --> 01:29:32,670
- Not until 6:00.

1967
01:29:32,668 --> 01:29:35,468
- Very technical.

1968
01:29:35,471 --> 01:29:37,141
- Okay, it's 6:00.

doing up there?

down there?

from Mexico.

1988

- Or down from Canada.

1989
01:30:39,568 --> 01:30:40,598

like flour to me.

Tastes like
something poisonous.

2008

- What does this mean, Ollie?

2101
01:36:41,496 --> 01:36:42,956
- How should I know?

2102
01:36:42,964 --> 01:36:44,434
You ask me, I think
we should surrender.

2103
01:36:44,432 --> 01:36:45,872
- It's got to be something.

2104
01:36:59,548 --> 01:37:00,908
- Did I do that?

2105
01:37:03,451 --> 01:37:07,051
- Hey! What's the matter
with you guys in there, huh?

2106
01:37:07,055 --> 01:37:09,155
What are you, crazy?

2107
01:37:15,463 --> 01:37:17,933
- Okay, tag them all prisoners.

2108
01:37:17,933 --> 01:37:19,933
Tactically captured
by counterattack

2109
01:37:19,935 --> 01:37:21,495
in this bunker here.
- Captured?

2110
01:37:21,503 --> 01:37:24,173
Hey, we knocked out
this position an hour ago.

2111
01:37:24,172 --> 01:37:28,072
- Are you arguing with
the decision of an umpire, sir?

2112
01:37:28,076 --> 01:37:30,476
- I'm not arguing!
I'm telling!

2113
01:37:30,478 --> 01:37:32,078
This bunker's
been neutralized.

2114
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:33,510
You're gonna have
to change your decision.

2115
01:37:33,515 --> 01:37:35,545
- I don't change nothing, sir.

2116
01:37:35,550 --> 01:37:37,300
- You giving me lip, sergeant?

2117
01:37:37,301 --> 01:37:39,051
- Knock if off, sir, or I'll
throw you out of the game.

2118
01:37:39,054 --> 01:37:40,424
- Throw me out?
- Yeah!

2119
01:37:40,422 --> 01:37:41,622
- Kill the umpire.
- Who said that?

2120
01:37:41,623 --> 01:37:43,123
I'll throw out
the whole bunch of you.

2121
01:37:43,124 --> 01:37:44,864
- Atta boy, sarge.
- Who's gonna throw who out?

2122
01:37:44,860 --> 01:37:46,190
- You shut up.
You're dead.

2123
01:37:46,194 --> 01:37:48,034
The decision
of the umpire stands.

2124
01:37:48,029 --> 01:37:49,099
- Oh, come on, now!

2125
01:37:49,097 --> 01:37:52,497
- It stands.

2126
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:54,630
Okay, all personnel
in the bunker,

2127
01:37:54,636 --> 01:37:56,166
come on out.

2128
01:37:56,171 --> 01:37:58,941
You've captured
this tank here.

2129
01:38:06,615 --> 01:38:09,615
- Boy scouts?

2130
01:38:09,618 --> 01:38:12,188
- Did he say
we captured that tank?

2131
01:38:12,187 --> 01:38:14,587
- That's what he said.

2132
01:38:14,589 --> 01:38:15,889
[All cheering]

2133
01:38:19,995 --> 01:38:21,655
- Hey, mister,
do we get to keep the tank

2134
01:38:21,663 --> 01:38:25,433
or do we have to give it back
after the war?

2135
01:38:25,433 --> 01:38:28,133
- All right, what's
your decision now, ump?

2136
01:38:28,136 --> 01:38:31,536
- Boy scouts, girl scouts,
my decision still stands.

2137
01:38:31,539 --> 01:38:33,569
You're captured.
That's it.

2138
01:38:36,611 --> 01:38:39,251
Boys: ¶ follow me, boys,
follow me ¶

2139

- hey, sergeant, come out here
and take a look.

2144
01:38:51,059 --> 01:38:52,689
- What?

2145
01:38:52,694 --> 01:38:54,564
Where do you think
you're going?

2146
01:38:54,562 --> 01:38:56,162
[Singing continues]

2147
01:38:56,164 --> 01:38:57,304
- What's that?

2148
01:38:57,299 --> 01:39:00,199
Boys:
¶ follow me, boys ¶

2149
01:39:00,201 --> 01:39:02,001
- my boy scouts.

2150
01:39:02,003 --> 01:39:04,073
- What's that?

2151
01:39:04,072 --> 01:39:05,312
- That's his boy scouts.

2152
01:39:05,307 --> 01:39:07,167
- Boy scouts?

2153
01:39:07,175 --> 01:39:09,935
Boys:
¶ and follow me ¶

2154
01:39:09,945 --> 01:39:12,305
¶ follow me, boys,

- boy scouts.

2156
01:39:13,931 --> 01:39:15,551
- That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

2157
01:39:15,550 --> 01:39:18,550
- What do we do with him now,
lieutenant?

2158
01:39:18,553 --> 01:39:21,253
- Show him how to tie
a sheepshank and let him go.

2159
01:39:21,256 --> 01:39:22,516
- Let me out of here,
sergeant.

Boys: ¶ put them down
and follow me ¶

2162
01:39:27,629 --> 01:39:28,699
- hi, Lem!

2163
01:39:28,697 --> 01:39:30,057
- Hi, guys!

2164
01:39:30,065 --> 01:39:31,625
Boy, am I glad to see you.

2165
01:39:31,633 --> 01:39:34,103
What are you doing up there?

2166
01:39:34,102 --> 01:39:35,602
- And I did it, Lem.

2167
01:39:35,603 --> 01:39:37,673
I started the whole war.
I pulled the string.

2168
01:39:37,672 --> 01:39:39,742
[Overlapping chatter]

2169
01:39:56,624 --> 01:39:58,764
- What is it, Lem?
What happened?

2170
01:39:58,760 --> 01:40:00,130
- Oh, what--

2171
01:40:00,128 --> 01:40:01,558
- I don't know, guys.

2172
01:40:01,563 --> 01:40:03,333
- Well, what about
all our stuff in the cabin?

2173
01:40:03,331 --> 01:40:05,601
[Overlapping talking]

2174
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:07,630
- Don't worry about it.
It will be all right.

2175
01:40:07,635 --> 01:40:09,295
- You think this could be
on the count of us

2176
01:40:09,304 --> 01:40:10,704
capturing that tank, Lem?

2177
01:40:10,705 --> 01:40:12,065
- Don't be a dork.

2178
01:40:12,073 --> 01:40:13,713
Somebody legal
wants us out of here.

2179
01:40:13,708 --> 01:40:15,108
Isn't that right, Lem?

2180
01:40:15,110 --> 01:40:16,580
- That's the way it looks,
Harry, yeah.

2181
01:40:16,578 --> 01:40:17,928
- Yeah, but why, Lem?

2182
01:40:17,928 --> 01:40:19,278
- I just don't know, Duke.

2183
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:20,650
[All chattering]

2184
01:40:20,648 --> 01:40:22,718
[Car horn honks]

2185
01:40:34,629 --> 01:40:35,699
Mrs. seibert.

2186
01:40:35,697 --> 01:40:37,297
- Lemuel.
Boys.

2187
01:40:37,298 --> 01:40:39,268
Boys:
Hello, Mrs. seibert.

2188
01:40:39,267 --> 01:40:42,637
- I couldn't believe it.

2189
01:40:42,637 --> 01:40:44,237
Ralph said
he was going to do it,

2190
01:40:44,239 --> 01:40:46,739
but I just
didn't believe him.

2191
01:40:46,741 --> 01:40:49,641
You're Charlie Davis' boy.
Oliver, isn't it?

2192
01:40:49,644 --> 01:40:51,414
- Yes, ma'am.

2193
01:40:51,413 --> 01:40:53,383
- And you're Duke.
- Yes, ma'am.

2194
01:40:53,381 --> 01:40:55,821
- Jimmy.
- Yes, ma'am.

2195
01:40:55,817 --> 01:40:57,277
- And you're--

2196
01:40:57,285 --> 01:40:59,785
- Virgil Higgins, ma'am.
But my name is tiger.

2197
01:40:59,788 --> 01:41:04,158
- Oh, I wanted it
to be a surprise.

2198
01:41:04,159 --> 01:41:06,289
- You wanted what to be
a surprise, Mrs. seibert?

2199
01:41:06,294 --> 01:41:09,204
- I was going to give you
this lake.

2200
01:41:09,197 --> 01:41:11,157
- Give it to us?

2201
01:41:11,166 --> 01:41:14,666
- Lemuel, do you think
I'm mentally unbalanced?

2202
01:41:14,669 --> 01:41:16,399
- You?

2203
01:41:16,404 --> 01:41:18,144
Why, certainly not.

2204
01:41:18,139 --> 01:41:19,709
- Well, my nephew says I am

2205
01:41:19,707 --> 01:41:22,407
just because I want
to give away my own property.

2206
01:41:22,410 --> 01:41:24,840
He's asked the court
to appoint a guardian

2207
01:41:24,846 --> 01:41:27,646
to manage
my financial affairs.

2208
01:41:27,649 --> 01:41:29,379
There's to be a hearing
in two weeks

2209
01:41:29,384 --> 01:41:31,784
on my mental competency.

2210
01:41:31,786 --> 01:41:34,386
Now, what would you do
if you were me?

2211
01:41:34,389 --> 01:41:37,189
- Well, the first thing I'd do
is punch him in the nose.

2212
01:41:37,192 --> 01:41:38,832
But if I were you,
Mrs. seibert,

2213
01:41:38,827 --> 01:41:41,327
I'd fight him legally
all the way.

2214
01:41:41,329 --> 01:41:44,359
- That's just what
I'm going to do.

2215
01:41:49,737 --> 01:41:52,207
Oh, lemuel,
will you help me?

2216
01:41:52,207 --> 01:41:54,367
- Any way I can.

2217
01:41:54,375 --> 01:41:55,705
- Thank you.

2218
01:41:55,710 --> 01:41:57,280
Good-bye, lemuel.

2219
01:41:57,278 --> 01:41:58,878
- Good-bye, Mrs. seibert.
- Good-bye, boys.

2220
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:00,380
Boys:
Bye, Mrs. seibert.

2221
01:42:00,381 --> 01:42:02,451
- Thank you.

2222
01:42:11,359 --> 01:42:14,659
- She was gonna give us
the whole lake.

2223
01:42:14,662 --> 01:42:17,502
Guess that would sound
kind of wacky, wouldn't it?

2224
01:42:21,169 --> 01:42:22,399
- And it is our further
contention, your honor,

2225
01:42:22,403 --> 01:42:24,373
that the increasing
burden of years

2226
01:42:24,372 --> 01:42:26,212
has visibly affected
Mrs. seibert's judgment

2227
01:42:26,207 --> 01:42:28,237
and financial responsibility,

2228
01:42:28,243 --> 01:42:31,143
that the management
of her not unsizable fortune

2229
01:42:31,146 --> 01:42:32,406
has become
increasingly clouded

2230
01:42:32,413 --> 01:42:34,153
with her
eccentric decisions...

2231
01:42:34,149 --> 01:42:35,449
- What's going on?

2232
01:42:35,450 --> 01:42:37,400
- Hasty formulations,

2233
01:42:37,401 --> 01:42:39,351
and inconsiderate
financial commitments.

2234
01:42:39,354 --> 01:42:41,494
Now, in support of these
contentions, your honor,

2235
01:42:41,489 --> 01:42:43,389
we have heard witnesses
who have observed

2236
01:42:43,391 --> 01:42:45,891
Mrs. seibert's behavior
over a long period of years.

2237
01:42:45,894 --> 01:42:48,334
- Ralph, stop biting
your fingernails.

2238
01:42:48,329 --> 01:42:50,409
[Laughter]

2239
01:42:50,414 --> 01:42:52,504
My sister used to put mustard
on his nails when he was little.

2240
01:42:52,500 --> 01:42:54,270
- Your honor.

2241
01:42:54,269 --> 01:42:58,539
- Mrs. seibert,
may we let counsel sum up?

2242
01:42:58,540 --> 01:43:01,770
- Oh, of course.
Go right ahead, young man.

2243
01:43:01,776 --> 01:43:04,276
- Thank you.

2244
01:43:04,279 --> 01:43:05,879
We have heard
from Mrs. Collins,

2245
01:43:05,880 --> 01:43:08,450
who testified that
as far back as 1926

2246
01:43:08,449 --> 01:43:09,779
she visited the lake

2247
01:43:09,784 --> 01:43:12,294
and was invited
into a nonexistent kitchen.

2248
01:43:12,287 --> 01:43:14,317
- He bit me once
when he was seven.

2249
01:43:14,322 --> 01:43:16,922
[Laughter]

2250
01:43:16,925 --> 01:43:19,855
- And Mr. Johnson,
who testified that he was hired

2251
01:43:19,861 --> 01:43:22,331
to remove a tree
because it blocked the view

2252
01:43:22,330 --> 01:43:25,460
from a nonexistent veranda.

2253
01:43:25,466 --> 01:43:28,326
Now, your honor,
as much as my client regrets it,

2254
01:43:28,336 --> 01:43:31,936
we must submit that Mrs. seibert
suffers from hallucinations,

2255
01:43:31,940 --> 01:43:34,510
that she is not able
to determine financial values

2256
01:43:34,509 --> 01:43:37,379
as manifested
by her capricious decision

2257
01:43:37,378 --> 01:43:38,908
to give
a half-a-million-dollar property

2258
01:43:38,913 --> 01:43:40,253
to a few dozen boy scouts.

2259
01:43:40,248 --> 01:43:42,478
- Hallucinations?

2260
01:43:42,483 --> 01:43:43,853
- For her own good,
your honor,

2261
01:43:43,851 --> 01:43:45,521
we ask that a guardian
be appointed

2262
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:48,290
to manage the affairs
of Hetty cutler seibert.

2263
01:43:48,289 --> 01:43:50,459
[Crowd murmuring]

2264
01:43:50,458 --> 01:43:52,458
- Young man,
you are a popinjay.

2265
01:43:52,460 --> 01:43:54,560
- Aunt Hetty.

2266
01:43:54,562 --> 01:43:57,262
- And you are an employer
of popinjays.

2267
01:43:57,265 --> 01:43:58,495
[Laughter]

2268
01:43:58,499 --> 01:44:00,229
[Gavel bangs]

2269
01:44:02,503 --> 01:44:04,843
- Your honor.
- Yes, Mr. siddons?

2270
01:44:04,839 --> 01:44:07,569
- Things have been moving
along here pretty fast,

2271
01:44:07,575 --> 01:44:09,375
and nobody has heard
Mrs. seibert

2272
01:44:09,377 --> 01:44:10,877
in her own defense.

2273
01:44:10,878 --> 01:44:13,348
Now, as a prospective trustee
of the lake property

2274
01:44:13,348 --> 01:44:15,878
and an interested party
to this action,

2275
01:44:15,883 --> 01:44:18,283
I'd like to ask
a few questions,

2276
01:44:18,286 --> 01:44:19,816
if our counsel will permit.

2277
01:44:19,821 --> 01:44:21,551
- I have no objections,
your honor.

2278
01:44:21,556 --> 01:44:23,016
- Well, I have, your honor.

2279
01:44:23,023 --> 01:44:24,493
If it please the court,
this is highly improper.

2280
01:44:24,492 --> 01:44:26,962
- This is not a trial,
Mr. Cooper.

2281
01:44:26,961 --> 01:44:29,561
I see no reason
why Mr. siddons' questions

2282
01:44:29,564 --> 01:44:32,004
would topple
the pillars of justice.

2283
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:35,400
Mrs. seibert, would you please
take the stand

2284
01:44:35,403 --> 01:44:37,443
and be sworn in?

2285
01:44:37,438 --> 01:44:39,968
- Isn't Lem just wonderful?

2286
01:44:39,974 --> 01:44:41,874
- He hasn't said anything yet.

2287
01:44:41,876 --> 01:44:44,576
- Shh.

2288
01:44:44,579 --> 01:44:48,049
- Do you solemnly swear
that the testimony you may give

2289
01:44:48,049 --> 01:44:50,479
in the cause now pending
before this court

2290
01:44:50,485 --> 01:44:52,285
shall be the truth,
the whole truth,

2291
01:44:52,287 --> 01:44:53,487
and nothing but the truth?

2292
01:44:53,488 --> 01:44:54,648
- Of course I do.

2293
01:44:54,656 --> 01:44:55,986
- State your name, please.

2294
01:44:55,990 --> 01:44:58,390
- Now, Charlie.
- Just for the record.

2295
01:44:58,393 --> 01:45:00,833
- Hetty cutler seibert.

2296
01:45:00,828 --> 01:45:04,458
- Thank you.

2297
01:45:04,465 --> 01:45:06,925
- All right,
Mr. siddons, proceed.

2298
01:45:06,934 --> 01:45:09,874
- Thank you, your honor.

2299
01:45:09,871 --> 01:45:14,371
Mrs. seibert, do you know
what an hallucination is?

2300
01:45:14,375 --> 01:45:16,635
- Anybody knows that.

2301
01:45:16,644 --> 01:45:20,554
It's a psychotic condition
marked by delusion

2302
01:45:20,548 --> 01:45:23,548
and loss of contact
with reality.

2303
01:45:23,551 --> 01:45:24,551
Isn't that correct?

2304
01:45:24,552 --> 01:45:25,892
- Oh, yes, yes.

2305
01:45:25,887 --> 01:45:27,517
I'd say that was
a reasonable description.

2306
01:45:27,522 --> 01:45:29,522
Now, Mrs. seibert,

2307
01:45:29,524 --> 01:45:31,594
Mrs. Collins and others
have testified

2308
01:45:31,592 --> 01:45:34,632
that you often sat alone
out at the lake,

2309
01:45:34,629 --> 01:45:36,529
usually on the steps
of the cottage.

2310
01:45:36,531 --> 01:45:38,861
- No one is ever alone

2311
01:45:38,866 --> 01:45:40,866
who has something good
to remember.

2312
01:45:40,868 --> 01:45:42,028
- No, of course not.

2313
01:45:42,036 --> 01:45:43,866
Now, Mrs. seibert,

2314
01:45:43,871 --> 01:45:46,871
I'm going to ask you
a blunt question.

2315
01:45:46,874 --> 01:45:49,914
Do you believe that a cottage
now exists at the lake?

2316
01:45:52,413 --> 01:45:56,083
Mrs. seibert?

2317
01:45:56,084 --> 01:45:58,924
- Only in my memory, lemuel.

2318
01:46:00,922 --> 01:46:03,692
- Mrs. seibert,

2319
01:46:03,691 --> 01:46:07,091
if a cottage does not now
exist at the lake,

2320
01:46:07,095 --> 01:46:09,625
what happened to it?

2321
01:46:13,501 --> 01:46:15,701
- It burned to the ground...

2322
01:46:15,703 --> 01:46:19,473
September 26,

2323
01:46:19,474 --> 01:46:23,084
1918.

2324
01:46:23,077 --> 01:46:25,747
Two days...

2325
01:46:27,915 --> 01:46:29,945
- Two days after you learned
that both your sons

2326
01:46:29,951 --> 01:46:32,081
had been killed in action
in France.

2327
01:46:34,389 --> 01:46:35,589
- Yes.

2328
01:46:35,590 --> 01:46:37,720
- Your honor,
he's leading the witness.

2329
01:46:37,725 --> 01:46:39,525
- Quite skillfully too.

2330
01:46:39,527 --> 01:46:42,157
Mr. siddons,
please do not lead the witness.

2331
01:46:42,163 --> 01:46:44,063
- Of course not, your honor.

2332
01:46:44,065 --> 01:46:46,525
Now, Mrs. seibert,

2333
01:46:46,534 --> 01:46:49,074
the cottage was
a very special place.

2334
01:46:49,070 --> 01:46:51,970
I mean, it meant a great deal
to your boys, didn't it?

2335
01:46:54,942 --> 01:46:56,542
- Yes.

2336
01:46:56,544 --> 01:47:01,154
My boys played there
many years.

2337
01:47:01,149 --> 01:47:06,449
That's why when you brought
the scouts to the lake,

2338
01:47:06,454 --> 01:47:10,694
I could see my boys
playing again.

2339
01:47:10,691 --> 01:47:13,691
Oh, I wanted that
more than anything--

2340
01:47:13,694 --> 01:47:17,464
a place where boys could play

2341
01:47:17,465 --> 01:47:19,495
just as my boys did.

2342
01:47:19,500 --> 01:47:22,170
- Your honor, I do not think
this is relevant.

2343
01:47:22,170 --> 01:47:24,770
- Well, then why don't
we make it relevant?

2344
01:47:24,772 --> 01:47:27,512
Why don't we direct
our attention to Mrs. seibert's

2345
01:47:27,508 --> 01:47:30,078
inability to determine
financial values.

2346
01:47:30,077 --> 01:47:33,077
Mrs. seibert, you are aware,
are you not,

2347
01:47:33,080 --> 01:47:34,650
of the real reason
for this hearing?

2348
01:47:34,649 --> 01:47:36,179
- Of course.

2349
01:47:36,184 --> 01:47:38,654
Ralph wants to keep the lake
in the family and develop it.

2350
01:47:38,653 --> 01:47:41,093
- Your honor,
I must protest.

2351
01:47:41,088 --> 01:47:43,558
- I suppose you must.

2352
01:47:43,558 --> 01:47:45,158
But I wish you wouldn't.

2353
01:47:48,596 --> 01:47:51,056
- Now, Mrs. seibert,

2354
01:47:51,065 --> 01:47:52,795
the development
of this property

2355
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:55,770
was planned as a benefit
to the community, of course?

2356
01:47:55,770 --> 01:47:59,040
- Well, more or less
as a benefit to Ralph,

2357
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:01,140
I should say--
a tax shelter.

2358
01:48:01,142 --> 01:48:02,142
[Crowd murmuring]

2359
01:48:02,143 --> 01:48:05,043
- A what?
- A tax shelter.

2360
01:48:05,046 --> 01:48:06,546
- Your honor, I cannot see

2361
01:48:06,547 --> 01:48:08,077
where this line
of questioning is taking us.

2362
01:48:08,082 --> 01:48:09,722
- Neither do I.

2363
01:48:09,717 --> 01:48:13,117
Certainly sounds interesting.
Go ahead.

2364
01:48:13,120 --> 01:48:15,120
- Mrs. seibert,
could you explain

2365
01:48:15,122 --> 01:48:16,822
this tax shelter
to his honor?

2366
01:48:16,824 --> 01:48:18,824
- Of course.

2367
01:48:18,826 --> 01:48:22,086
It's simply a question
of accelerated depreciation

2368
01:48:22,096 --> 01:48:24,126
on development housing,

2369
01:48:24,131 --> 01:48:27,501
assuming a straight-line
depreciation rate

2370
01:48:27,502 --> 01:48:29,672
and subsequent sale
at book value,

2371
01:48:29,670 --> 01:48:33,740
which would create
a capital-gains situation,

2372
01:48:33,741 --> 01:48:38,541
thereby avoiding
75% of normal taxes.

2373
01:48:38,546 --> 01:48:43,176
Permitted under section 1201
of the internal revenue code.

2374
01:48:45,620 --> 01:48:48,890
- Was that clear, your honor?

2375
01:48:48,890 --> 01:48:51,660
- I never heard
anything like it.

2376
01:48:51,659 --> 01:48:53,159
- Well, I guess those
are all the questions

2377
01:48:53,160 --> 01:48:55,440
I wanted to ask, your honor.

2378
01:48:55,445 --> 01:48:57,725
- Mr. Cooper, you don't
have any questions, do you?

2379
01:48:57,732 --> 01:49:00,632
- No, your honor.

2380
01:49:00,635 --> 01:49:02,635
- Good.

2381
01:49:02,637 --> 01:49:04,567
- Mrs. seibert,
thank you very much.

2382
01:49:04,572 --> 01:49:06,172
You may step down.

2383
01:49:06,173 --> 01:49:09,813
- Would it help if I'd quote
from section 1201 of the code?

2384
01:49:09,810 --> 01:49:13,310
[Applause]

2385
01:49:13,314 --> 01:49:15,554
- Lem did it.
He did it.

2386
01:49:15,550 --> 01:49:18,750
- That's the prettiest
thing I ever saw.

2387
01:49:18,753 --> 01:49:20,693
[Gavel bangs]

2388
01:49:20,688 --> 01:49:23,288
- Order.
Order, please.

2389
01:49:25,927 --> 01:49:28,187
Mr. Hastings, I am going
to be charitable

2390
01:49:28,195 --> 01:49:30,325
and give you permission
to withdraw your request

2391
01:49:30,331 --> 01:49:34,571
for appointment of a guardian
for your aunt, Mrs. seibert.

2392
01:49:34,569 --> 01:49:36,169
Do you wish to make
such a withdrawal?

2393
01:49:36,170 --> 01:49:40,670
- Yes, your honor, I do.

2394
01:49:40,675 --> 01:49:44,805
- Petition for appointment
of a guardian for Mrs. seibert

2395
01:49:44,812 --> 01:49:46,352
is hereby denied.

2396
01:49:46,347 --> 01:49:47,647
Hearing adjourned.

2397
01:49:47,648 --> 01:49:49,718
[Applause]

2398
01:49:53,588 --> 01:49:55,318
- Way to go, Lem.

2399
01:49:55,323 --> 01:49:57,693
You showed them, Lem.

2400
01:50:04,665 --> 01:50:07,325
- [Playing saxophone]

2401
01:50:07,335 --> 01:50:10,165
- ¶ Happy Birthday to you ¶

2402
01:50:10,171 --> 01:50:13,311
¶ Happy Birthday to you ¶

2403
01:50:13,307 --> 01:50:16,777
¶ Happy Birthday, dear John ¶

2404
01:50:16,777 --> 01:50:20,247
¶ Happy Birthday to you ¶

2405
01:50:20,247 --> 01:50:21,807
- [continues playing]

2406
01:50:21,816 --> 01:50:24,146
[Both chuckle]

2407
01:50:24,151 --> 01:50:25,991
- Oh, vida,

2408
01:50:25,987 --> 01:50:28,987
didn't I tell you last year
no more birthdays?

2409
01:50:28,990 --> 01:50:30,720
- Mm-hmm, you tell me that
every year.

2410
01:50:30,725 --> 01:50:32,185
Happy Birthday, dear.

2411
01:50:32,193 --> 01:50:33,393
- Thank you.
- Happy Birthday, John.

2412
01:50:33,394 --> 01:50:35,384
- All right, Lem.

2413
01:50:35,379 --> 01:50:37,359
- Now, make a wish
and blow out the candle.

2414
01:50:37,365 --> 01:50:39,765
- Make a wish.
Well...

2415
01:50:39,767 --> 01:50:42,367
[Inhales deeply]

2416
01:50:42,370 --> 01:50:44,000
Say, how old am I?

2417
01:50:44,005 --> 01:50:45,665
Darned if I remember.

2418
01:50:45,673 --> 01:50:47,743
- And I refuse to tell you.

2419
01:50:47,742 --> 01:50:50,212
- You're the same age you were
that morning you hired me

2420
01:50:50,211 --> 01:50:51,641
and not a day older.

2421
01:50:51,646 --> 01:50:54,346
- Oh, good lord,
do you remember that morning?

2422
01:50:54,348 --> 01:50:56,178
- Aren't you going
to make a wish?

2423
01:50:56,183 --> 01:50:58,753
- You know, I figured you
for a regular whippersnapper

2424
01:50:58,753 --> 01:50:59,773
that morning.

2425
01:50:59,770 --> 01:51:00,790
Yeah, but I liked your gall.

2426
01:51:00,788 --> 01:51:02,858
- John.
- Yeah?

2427
01:51:02,857 --> 01:51:04,187
I know, make a wish.

2428
01:51:04,191 --> 01:51:06,431
All right.

2429
01:51:06,427 --> 01:51:09,957
Maybe I ought to wish
that Lem flunks his bar exam

2430
01:51:09,964 --> 01:51:11,834
next month, hmm?

2431
01:51:11,832 --> 01:51:14,002
The store won't be the same
without you, Lem.

2432
01:51:14,001 --> 01:51:17,241
- Well, John, I wouldn't--

2433
01:51:17,238 --> 01:51:19,408
I wouldn't plan
on replacing me right away.

2434
01:51:19,407 --> 01:51:21,437
When whitey comes home,

2435
01:51:21,442 --> 01:51:23,742
there'll be one professional
man in the family,

2436
01:51:23,744 --> 01:51:26,054
and I, uh--
I think maybe that's enough.

2437
01:51:26,047 --> 01:51:28,007
- Lem.

2438
01:51:28,015 --> 01:51:30,715
- Vi, I've had my day in court.

2439
01:51:30,718 --> 01:51:32,248
We both know that.

2440
01:51:32,253 --> 01:51:35,023
- Oh, speaking of whitey,

2441
01:51:35,022 --> 01:51:38,692
you haven't seen
the latest, John.

2442
01:51:38,693 --> 01:51:40,793
This was taken
on leave in Paris.

2443
01:51:40,795 --> 01:51:42,695

to be the cautious years.

If you don't stop
overdoing it,

2620

might be real trouble.

I'll make a deal with you.

Who's gonna coordinate

Be quiet and listen to him.

You'd never quit
on your own,

You've got to give up
the scouts.

We voted on it a month ago,

After 20 years, kicked out.

2662

doing it for your own good.

2663

- And nobody's trying
to kick you out.

- Of course not.

2665
02:01:33,320 --> 02:01:34,920
You'll still be
a part of the troop.

02:01:34,921 --> 02:01:37,821
We'll always need
your advice and experience.

2667

It's just that you won't
have to do anything.

As a special tribute to you,

we're gonna create the title
scoutmaster emeritus.

eagle scout, didn't he?

Scoutmaster what?

2682

emeritus mean?

02:07:54,768 --> 02:07:56,898
"that's so I can be
a lawyer someday."

2792
02:07:56,903 --> 02:08:01,443
Well, because of all the time
that Lem gave to all of us,

2793
02:08:01,441 --> 02:08:04,311
that "someday" had to be
postponed indefinitely,

2794
02:08:04,310 --> 02:08:06,740
but not forever.

2795
02:08:11,718 --> 02:08:13,278
And now, by the authority
vested in me

2796
02:08:13,286 --> 02:08:16,446
through the state regents
and the university,

2797
02:08:16,456 --> 02:08:18,816
I hereby confer on you,
lemuel siddons,

2798
02:08:18,825 --> 02:08:21,455
the honorary degree,
doctor of laws.

2799
02:08:21,461 --> 02:08:24,931
[Cheers and applause]

2801

¶ ¶

2802
02:08:35,875 --> 02:08:38,335
- okay, counselor,
you're on.

2803
02:08:38,344 --> 02:08:41,414
[Cheers and applause]

2804
02:08:50,490 --> 02:08:52,860
- There are so many things
I'd like to say,

2805
02:08:52,859 --> 02:08:54,759
but it's--

2806
02:08:54,761 --> 02:08:58,101
it's a little hard
to talk right now.

2807
02:08:58,098 --> 02:09:02,068
All I can say is thank you...

2808
02:09:02,068 --> 02:09:04,798
For everything.

2809
02:09:04,804 --> 02:09:07,844
I want to thank you, hoodoo,

2810
02:09:07,841 --> 02:09:09,911
and, whitey...

2811
02:09:12,112 --> 02:09:15,382
And, quong,

2812
02:09:15,381 --> 02:09:17,951
and, beefy,

2813
02:09:17,951 --> 02:09:21,121
and, Frankie,
and, Mickey,

2814
02:09:21,121 --> 02:09:25,861
all the guys
down through the years.

2815
02:09:25,859 --> 02:09:28,759
And I want to thank my wife.

2816
02:09:30,930 --> 02:09:33,000
All of you who've made my life

2817
02:09:32,999 --> 02:09:37,469
the happiest life
a man could have.

2818
02:09:37,470 --> 02:09:40,000
And, Mrs. seibert,

2819
02:09:40,006 --> 02:09:42,436
a very special thanks to you

2820
02:09:42,442 --> 02:09:47,082
for making all this possible.

2821
02:09:47,080 --> 02:09:50,920
Well, I, uh--
I guess that's all.

2822
02:09:50,917 --> 02:09:53,917
[Marching band plays

2823
02:09:53,920 --> 02:10:00,420
¶ ¶

2824
02:10:00,426 --> 02:10:02,526
- these were made special, Lem.

2825
02:10:02,529 --> 02:10:05,959
- Well, all I can say
is they ought to do the job.

2826
02:10:05,965 --> 02:10:08,425
[Laughter]

2827
02:10:12,872 --> 02:10:15,372
[Cheers and applause]

2828
02:10:17,811 --> 02:10:20,081
Well, what do I say now?

2829
02:10:20,079 --> 02:10:22,949
- What you always say, dear.

2830
02:10:22,949 --> 02:10:26,119
- Oh.

2831
02:10:26,119 --> 02:10:30,189
All right, guys,
now let's shape it up in there.

2832
02:10:30,190 --> 02:10:31,920
Fall in

2833
