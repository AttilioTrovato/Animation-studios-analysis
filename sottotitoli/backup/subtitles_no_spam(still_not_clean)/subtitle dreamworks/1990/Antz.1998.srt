1
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,150
<i>All my life, I've lived and worked
in the big city,</i>

2
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,234
<i>which...</i>

3
00:01:21,635 --> 00:01:23,680
<i>never I think of it,
is kind of a problems,</i>

4
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,860
<i>since I always feel
uncomfortable around crowds.</i>

5
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,930
<i>I mean it. I.. I have this fear
of enclosed spaces.</i>

6
00:01:29,931 --> 00:01:32,620
<i>I.. I.. I.. I everything makes me
feel trapped all the time.</i>

7
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:34,877
<i>I mean, I.. I always tell myself,</i>

8
00:01:34,878 --> 00:01:37,081
<i>there is gotta be something
better out there but...</i>

9
00:01:37,155 --> 00:01:39,054
<i>maybe, maybe,
maybe I think too much, yeah.</i>

10
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,780
<i>I.. I.. I think everything
must go back to the fact,</i>

11
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,780
<i>that I had a very anxious childhood.</i>

12
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,050
You know, my mother
never had time for me.

13
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:51,000
You know, when you're the middle child
in a family of 5 million,

14
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,040
you don't get any attention.

15
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,640
I mean, how is it possible?

16
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,347
And I've always had these...

17
00:01:56,348 --> 00:01:59,054
these abandonment issues
which plague me.

18
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,170
My father was, was basically a drone,
like I've said.

19
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,810
And you know the guy flew away
when I was just a larva.

20
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,090
And...

21
00:02:06,691 --> 00:02:07,785
my job...

22
00:02:08,286 --> 00:02:10,120
don't get me started on because I...

23
00:02:10,121 --> 00:02:11,330
it really annoys me.

24
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:14,330
I.. I was not cut out to be a worker,
I'll tell you right now.

25
00:02:14,554 --> 00:02:17,190
I.. I.. I feel physically inadequate.

26
00:02:17,191 --> 00:02:19,364
I.. I.. My whole life, I've never,

27
00:02:19,365 --> 00:02:22,690
I've never been able to lift more than
10 times my own body weight.

28
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:27,180
And, and when you get down to it,
handling dirt is, you know...

29
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,690
is not my idea of a rewarding career.

30
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:31,499
It's this whole...

31
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,778
gung ho, super organism thing that, that...

32
00:02:34,903 --> 00:02:36,791
that you know, I can't get.

33
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:39,388
I try, but I don't, I don't get it.
I mean, you know...

34
00:02:40,013 --> 00:02:42,145
What is it? I'm supposed to
do everything for the colony.

35
00:02:42,469 --> 00:02:45,141
And.. And what about my needs?
What about me?

36
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,530
I mean, I've gotta believe there is someplace
out there that's better than this.

37
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,590
Otherwise, I would just curl up
in a larval position and weep.

38
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:56,060
The whole system makes me feel...

39
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,330
insignificant.

40
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:00,810
Excellent.

41
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,460
You've made a real breakthrough.
I have?

42
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:04,539
Yes, Z.

43
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,560
You are insignificant.

44
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,870
I am?

45
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,550
Ground floor.

46
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,440
Worker.

47
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,050
Soldier.

48
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,080
Worker.

49
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,630
Let's try it again.

50
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:10,893
Firm grip.

51
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:11,918
Swing hard.

52
00:04:11,943 --> 00:04:13,163
Back straight.

53
00:04:13,288 --> 00:04:14,512
Concentrate.

54
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,880
Follow through.

55
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:44,630
Ok. I've got to keep a positive attitude.

56
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,720
A good attitude, even no one,
I'm utterly insignificant.

57
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,800
I'm.. I'm insignificant, but with attitude.

58
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:55,000
Sorry, Z.

59
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:56,852
I didn't see ya.

60
00:04:56,853 --> 00:04:57,930
Great, Azteca.

61
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:00,770
It's working already.
I'm.. I'm so meaningless, I'm invisible.

62
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,240
Now, you're getting it.

63
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:06,483
After all,

64
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:08,934
it's not about you.

65
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,926
It's about us,

66
00:05:11,151 --> 00:05:12,234
the team.

67
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,695
It's about...

68
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,264
this.

69
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,630
A giant hole in the ground?

70
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,860
Ok, people. Are we feeling good?

71
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,110
Yeah.
Great.

72
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:28,156
Now, R-1734 through Z-7829,

73
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,787
you guys are on wrecking ball.

74
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,869
You got it.

75
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:31,930
Swell.

76
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,369
You got it. Alright.

77
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,180
Swing time.

78
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,130
Let's get physical.
I love this job.

79
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,980
Now, remember Azteca, be the ball.

80
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,090
That's the main thing.
Remember that.

81
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,240
You know, gotta be one with the ball.

82
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,230
Would you cut it out already?

83
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,341
Jeez. I love my work.

84
00:05:47,342 --> 00:05:48,580
And you well...

85
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,580
You think too much.

86
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,497
Come on, Z.

87
00:05:52,498 --> 00:05:55,220
Help us build a bigger, better colony.

88
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,830
And for crying out loud,
try to be happy about it.

89
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,130
Sure, you know.
I mean, why...

90
00:06:00,131 --> 00:06:02,970
How could I possibly be unhappy being
a piece of construction equipment?

91
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:04,782
Ok workers, remember.

92
00:06:05,107 --> 00:06:06,170
Here it comes.

93
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,870
Be the ball.

94
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,600
Let the energy flow through you.

95
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:17,560
Grin and bear it.
This is.. This is for the colony.

96
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,370
This is...

97
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,420
This is just a lawsuit waiting to happen.

98
00:06:24,421 --> 00:06:26,530
Hang on. Here we go.
Faster. Harder.

99
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:29,023
Did I happen to mention,

100
00:06:29,024 --> 00:06:30,789
that heights make me nauseous?

101
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:31,390
No.

102
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,650
This is a ball.

103
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:45,529
Oh, Z.

104
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,614
Yes. Yes. Yes. I understand.

105
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:48,740
I dropped the ball.

106
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:53,334
Workers.

107
00:06:53,459 --> 00:06:54,714
They're weak.

108
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:56,547
They lack discipline.

109
00:06:56,872 --> 00:06:58,264
They lack commitment.

110
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:01,760
General, I know there is been a glitch
or two.

111
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,086
But...

112
00:07:03,087 --> 00:07:05,660
everybody is working full tilt as it is and...

113
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,195
You can't help it,

114
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,804
it's your nature.

115
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,930
But in spite of your limitations,

116
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,930
you are going to finish
this tunnel, on schedule.

117
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,730
Come hell or high water.

118
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:21,160
From now anyone who falls behind is going to have
personally to explain themselves to Colonel Cutter.

119
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,896
And let me assure you,

120
00:07:22,897 --> 00:07:25,380
the colonel is not as understanding
as I am.

121
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,000
Dismissed.

122
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,256
Four more days, Cutter.

123
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:33,190
Four more days.

124
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:37,230
Then we can bid final farewell
to their kind of incompetence.

125
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,530
Yes, sir.

126
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,140
A fresh start.

127
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:41,926
Imagine it!

128
00:07:42,251 --> 00:07:43,674
A strong colony, sir.

129
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,150
A colony, we can be proud of.

130
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,610
Yes, but we're not there yet.

131
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:49,790
Cutter,

132
00:07:50,115 --> 00:07:53,514
we just got word that a termite
army has mobilized against us.

133
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:54,770
Against us?

134
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:57,540
We'll have to send troops
deep into hostile territory,

135
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,150
to attack their colony.

136
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,550
Attack a termite colony, sir?

137
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:02,926
That is suicide.

138
00:08:02,927 --> 00:08:03,840
Exactly.

139
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,667
Do you have the list I asked for?

140
00:08:06,051 --> 00:08:07,280
Yes, General.

141
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:11,180
These are the units loyal to the queen.

142
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,860
Then they're the ones we'll be sending.

143
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:19,110
It's a shame.
There is some fine officers here.

144
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,137
Don't we need the queen's approval,

145
00:08:22,562 --> 00:08:23,650
to declare war?

146
00:08:23,651 --> 00:08:25,290
Our very next stop, Cutter.

147
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:30,580
General, we've been at peace
with that colony for years.

148
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,683
Why would they attack us?

149
00:08:32,684 --> 00:08:33,810
They want our land.

150
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,570
They're desperate
for more foraging territory.

151
00:08:36,594 --> 00:08:39,190
Perhaps they think we've
grown soft or weak.

152
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,575
Why don't we dispatch an ambassador,

153
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,454
negotiate a new treaty?

154
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,416
Certainly we don't need to send soldiers.

155
00:08:46,417 --> 00:08:47,300
Believe me.

156
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:50,310
Every ant in this colony
is so precious to me.

157
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,610
That's why we must strike now.

158
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,280
We have the element of surprise.

159
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:58,938
If the termite shock
troops enter our colony,

160
00:08:59,063 --> 00:08:59,781
well...

161
00:08:59,782 --> 00:09:00,994
Yes General,

162
00:09:01,719 --> 00:09:03,634
I know what they can do to us.

163
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,150
Very well.

164
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,864
You've made a wise decision.

165
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,320
In fact, you've insured
the future of this colony.

166
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,040
Hello General.

167
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:19,473
Princess Bala.

168
00:09:19,598 --> 00:09:21,080
Oh what a nice surprise.

169
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:23,230
You look lovelier each time I see you.

170
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,055
Thanks.

171
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:27,954
I hope you're not just here on business.

172
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,479
Oh, of course...

173
00:09:29,904 --> 00:09:30,960
of course not.

174
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:32,453
Because...

175
00:09:32,778 --> 00:09:34,782
it might be nice if we had...

176
00:09:35,507 --> 00:09:36,786
a conversation,

177
00:09:37,151 --> 00:09:38,974
once before we get married.

178
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,350
You're absolutely right.

179
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:43,151
Cutter, schedule some private
time for me and Princess Bala.

180
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:47,830
In fact sir, there is time right now,
for a personal moment.

181
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,050
We're, a few seconds ahead of schedule.

182
00:09:50,074 --> 00:09:51,074
Excellent.

183
00:09:51,372 --> 00:09:52,372
Princess.

184
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:53,530
Well,

185
00:09:53,835 --> 00:09:56,410
a few seconds isn't much but...

186
00:09:57,335 --> 00:09:59,384
I guess if it's quality time.

187
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,566
So...

188
00:10:02,267 --> 00:10:03,350
how was your day?

189
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,268
Anything interesting happen?

190
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:06,420
We declared war.

191
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,260
Declared war?

192
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:10,721
Boy...

193
00:10:10,722 --> 00:10:12,100
talk about a rough day.

194
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:15,880
Sir, I hate to interrupt but,
time stands still for no ant.

195
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,290
Princess.

196
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:24,570
Mom,

197
00:10:24,615 --> 00:10:25,908
could you remind me,

198
00:10:26,433 --> 00:10:28,098
why am I marrying this guy?

199
00:10:28,122 --> 00:10:30,800
Bala, do we have to argue
about this again?

200
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:33,574
We don't seem to have anything in common.

201
00:10:33,575 --> 00:10:35,220
The guy is a stiff.

202
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:39,019
Yes darling, I know the general
may be a little gruff and...

203
00:10:39,444 --> 00:10:41,815
somewhat overbearing at times but...

204
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,684
I know that he cares about you.

205
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,370
He is just not particularly good
at showing it.

206
00:10:47,871 --> 00:10:51,870
But you should've seen how persistently
he asked for your hand in marriage.

207
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,420
But why me?

208
00:10:53,491 --> 00:10:56,040
Because you're the one
who has to continue my work.

209
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,870
It's your place, dear.

210
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,997
What if I don't like my place?

211
00:11:01,022 --> 00:11:03,034
Everyone has their place, Bala.

212
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,228
You,

213
00:11:04,229 --> 00:11:05,970
the soldiers, the workers.

214
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,050
Now, it's not all that bad
being princess, is it?

215
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:12,120
Would you prefer to be
carting around dirt all day?

216
00:11:12,244 --> 00:11:14,180
Oh mother, don't be so dramatic.

217
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,780
At least they seem to have
some fun every now and then.

218
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,355
Two aphid beers.

219
00:11:25,656 --> 00:11:27,590
Why'd I have to be born a worker?

220
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,470
You soldiers get all the glory,

221
00:11:30,471 --> 00:11:31,970
plus you get to go out in the world.

222
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,430
You know you meet interesting insects,
you get to kill them.

223
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,630
Yeah. But you get to spend
all day with those...

224
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:41,020
beautiful worker girls.

225
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:43,196
Weaver, they're career girls.

226
00:11:43,197 --> 00:11:44,960
They're obsessed with digging.

227
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:49,590
I really don't think I'm ever
gonna meet the right girl for me.

228
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,240
Who said a girl for you?
I was talking about a girl for me.

229
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:55,370
Don't you want your aphid beer?

230
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:56,870
Call me crazy but...

231
00:11:57,194 --> 00:11:59,876
I have a thing about drinking from
the anus of another creature. Ok?

232
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,660
Suit yourself.

233
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:06,420
Me, I'm cutting loose.

234
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:08,560
We got royal inspection coming up.

235
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,734
Inspection?

236
00:12:09,735 --> 00:12:13,550
Meaning you're gonna stand around like an idiot
while a bunch of blue bloods smirk at you.

237
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:15,650
I don't know how
you put up with it, Weaver.

238
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:16,585
Z,

239
00:12:17,086 --> 00:12:18,810
I've known you for a long time. Right?

240
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:21,190
Definitely.
You were born two seconds after me.

241
00:12:21,191 --> 00:12:24,180
Yeah. And ever since we were little,
I've been listening to you complain.

242
00:12:24,181 --> 00:12:26,360
What are you bitching about?

243
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,870
In case you haven't noticed,
we ants are running the show.

244
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,770
We're the lords of the Earth.

245
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:33,500
Hey. Don't talk to me about earth, ok?

246
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:35,630
Because I just spent all day
hauling it around.

247
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,050
There is just gotta be a better place.

248
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,147
There is.

249
00:12:42,372 --> 00:12:43,824
I've been there.

250
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,810
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Were you talking to me?

251
00:12:46,811 --> 00:12:48,667
There is a better place...

252
00:12:50,092 --> 00:12:51,610
Insectopia.

253
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,601
Really.

254
00:12:53,926 --> 00:12:56,064
Lunatic at 3:00.

255
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:00,400
You can't understand
till you go there and see it yourself.

256
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:03,080
You can be your own ant there.

257
00:13:03,604 --> 00:13:05,840
The streets are paved with food.

258
00:13:05,964 --> 00:13:08,270
Nobody telling you what to do.

259
00:13:08,494 --> 00:13:09,740
No wars.

260
00:13:10,141 --> 00:13:11,260
No colony.

261
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:14,859
I shoulda never left.

262
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,460
Yeah. Fascinating.

263
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,420
We were on a long range recon.
I got cut off from my unit.

264
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:24,200
Nothing like post-traumatic stress
disorder to make your day complete.

265
00:13:24,224 --> 00:13:25,311
Then I saw it...

266
00:13:25,736 --> 00:13:27,020
Insectopia!

267
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,820
You head towards the monolith.

268
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,600
Ten clicks past the great canyons
to the land of red and white.

269
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:33,630
Hey, gramps.

270
00:13:33,819 --> 00:13:35,460
You've had enough for one night.

271
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,630
Come on.
Before you get in trouble.

272
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,152
Head for the monolith.

273
00:13:39,353 --> 00:13:40,353
Listen to me!

274
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:41,600
The monolith!

275
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,700
That guy is got a screw loose.

276
00:13:44,701 --> 00:13:46,400
Cross the lake!
Insectopia.

277
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:49,280
Wouldn't it be great if it were that easy?

278
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:50,850
Yeah.

279
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:53,681
Dream on, Z.
Cross the lake.

280
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,050
Look for the land of red and white.

281
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:00,272
This is so...

282
00:14:01,497 --> 00:14:02,497
gritty.

283
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,620
Ten minutes and we're out of here.
Right? I mean this place is off limits.

284
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:08,470
Just blame it on me.
Say it was all my idea.

285
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,077
It is all your idea.

286
00:14:10,301 --> 00:14:13,540
Besides, no one is gonna recognize us.

287
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:16,300
Come on, girls.
What do you say?

288
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:19,220
Let's take a walk on the wild side.

289
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:23,460
<i>Ok, everybody. 6:15. Time to dance.</i>

290
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,986
Time to cut a rug, Z.

291
00:14:26,411 --> 00:14:28,144
Oh, no. That's ok.
I'm gonna...

292
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,420
I'm gonna leave the rug
just the way it is, Weaver.

293
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,940
Step back, ladies.

294
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:47,570
I'm gonna ask one of these
workers to dance with me.

295
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,270
What a bunch of losers.

296
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,150
Mindless zombies capitulating
to an oppressive system.

297
00:14:57,151 --> 00:14:59,077
Hi. Want to dance?

298
00:14:59,802 --> 00:15:01,504
Absolutely.

299
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:03,610
Follow me.

300
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:08,290
So, how come I haven't seen you
around here before?

301
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:10,310
I don't get out much.

302
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:13,010
I... I work over at the palace.

303
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:14,393
The palace?

304
00:15:14,518 --> 00:15:16,304
I bet those royals really live it up.

305
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:18,565
Of course they're all a little...

306
00:15:18,566 --> 00:15:19,710
you know from inbreeding.

307
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:20,940
What?

308
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,500
What on earth are you doing?

309
00:15:38,501 --> 00:15:40,518
Well, actually, to tell you the truth,

310
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:42,430
I'm.. I'm sort of making it up.

311
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,140
Really?

312
00:15:44,264 --> 00:15:46,464
You know, why does everybody
have to dance the same way?

313
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:47,902
You know, that's completely boring.

314
00:15:48,126 --> 00:15:49,714
You know, it's monotonous.

315
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:52,000
It's no fun.

316
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,900
Watch your step, worker.

317
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:26,850
You watch yours, buddy,
or you'll be in big trouble.

318
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:28,230
That's. That's ok. I'll...

319
00:16:28,231 --> 00:16:29,940
I'm gonna let him off this time.

320
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:33,080
Are you crazy?
This guy is built like a pebble.

321
00:16:33,081 --> 00:16:35,050
Aren't you even gonna defend yourself?

322
00:16:35,074 --> 00:16:36,670
Hey, buddy. Get back in place.

323
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,140
Me?

324
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,064
What if he doesn't want to?

325
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,990
Yeah. Wha.. What if I don't like my place?

326
00:16:46,014 --> 00:16:48,300
What's he talking about?
We got us a troublemaker.

327
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:49,680
Buckle up, Spanky.

328
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:53,640
This one goes out
to all the lazy workers.

329
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,270
You ought to watch that
aggressive behavior, buddy.

330
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,740
He is just a worker.

331
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:23,880
Princess Bala! Princess Bala!
The guards are coming.

332
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,430
Let's get outta here.

333
00:17:26,955 --> 00:17:27,974
Wait!

334
00:17:30,473 --> 00:17:31,473
Princess?

335
00:17:31,497 --> 00:17:32,644
You're a princess?

336
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:34,970
I gotta go.

337
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:36,584
When can I see you again?

338
00:17:36,908 --> 00:17:38,122
Let me think.

339
00:17:39,247 --> 00:17:40,314
Never.

340
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,280
Bye.
No. Wait.

No.

349
00:18:39,698 --> 00:18:40,764
Thanks I...

350
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:44,084
I think I'm gonna go.
Yeah, I don't blame you.

351
00:18:44,285 --> 00:18:47,550
It's always slow in here the night
before one of those royal reviews.

352
00:18:48,174 --> 00:18:51,020
I guess the soldiers need their
shut-eye before they meet the queen.

353
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:53,230
I don't blame ya.
That's it!

354
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,433
You know I was once...

355
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:57,458
See ya.

356
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,250
Weaver.

357
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,759
I figured it out.

358
00:19:08,984 --> 00:19:10,589
Weaver. Weaver.

359
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:11,660
What? What?

360
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:13,600
I got a great idea.

361
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,476
You gotta switch places with me.

362
00:19:15,701 --> 00:19:17,804
Let me go to the
inspection instead of you.

363
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:19,046
What time is it?

364
00:19:19,071 --> 00:19:22,010
Weaver.
The royal family will be there.

365
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:24,040
This is the only way I can see her.

366
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:25,443
See who?

367
00:19:25,768 --> 00:19:27,414
Princess Bala.

368
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:28,800
Are you nuts?

369
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:31,350
You want me to switch places with you?

370
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,160
Do you know how much trouble
you can get into

371
00:19:34,161 --> 00:19:36,630
for even talking about
impersonating a soldier?

372
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,030
You can get in trouble just for listening

373
00:19:39,031 --> 00:19:41,590
to someone talking about
impersonating a soldier.

374
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,990
You have to help me.

375
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:47,860
If I can't see her again,
my life is not worth living.

376
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,800
Plea.. Plea.. Please Weaver. Please.

377
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:54,950
Switch jobs with me.
Just for a day.

378
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:58,020
Th.. Think. Think of all the things
that I've done for you.

379
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,920
I can't think of any.

380
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:04,590
Ok. So, think of all the things
that I'm gonna do for you.

381
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,190
Would I meet some worker girls?

382
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:12,390
Are you kidding?
They always go after the new guy.

383
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,130
It's like a sport for them.

384
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:19,070
And.. And believe me, they will definitely go
for an adorable little insect like you.

385
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,437
Weaver, I...

386
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:23,934
I have to see her again.

387
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,270
Z, what kind of chance
do you have with a princess?

388
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,540
I mean, she probably
won't even remember you.

389
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:35,766
I.. I know it sounds nuts,

390
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,484
but I have to try.

391
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,560
Oh, boy.

392
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,470
Princess, fancy meeting you here.

393
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:48,340
What do you say we lose this crowd?

394
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,129
Oh, me? You know, I...

395
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:53,750
I wear many hats.

396
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:56,120
I guess you'd have to call me
a Renaissance ant.

397
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:58,060
Eyes right!

398
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:04,970
Beautiful! Just beautiful!

399
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,900
The precision. The order.

400
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,940
Princess Bala! Princess Bala!

401
00:21:11,941 --> 00:21:13,470
Hey. Hey it's me.

402
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,550
Remember Z from the bar?

403
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,060
Princess Bala!
Princess Bala! Princess...

404
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:21,310
Bala, you must encourage the troops.

405
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,250
Wave.

406
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:27,640
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Guys. I..I..I.. Sorry.

407
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,150
I just got a better offer.
Could you excu...

408
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:31,620
Company halt!
Excu...

409
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,300
Princess Bala!

410
00:21:38,161 --> 00:21:39,361
Princess Bala.

411
00:21:39,362 --> 00:21:40,800
Quiet there!
Get back in rank.

412
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,122
You new, kid?

413
00:21:43,647 --> 00:21:45,157
Yeah, yes, yes, but...

414
00:21:45,158 --> 00:21:46,534
You know, I'm getting out soon I...

415
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,300
I got a trial membership.

416
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,536
Trial membership.

417
00:21:50,061 --> 00:21:51,074
That's a good one!

418
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:53,460
Name is Barbatus.

419
00:21:53,684 --> 00:21:54,584
Z.

420
00:21:54,585 --> 00:21:55,585
Right face!

421
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:05,793
Sacrifice.

422
00:22:06,218 --> 00:22:09,344
To some, it is just a word.

423
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,180
To others, it is a code.

424
00:22:12,281 --> 00:22:14,570
Jeez. I'm really bad at word games.

425
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:18,150
A soldier knows that the life
of an individual ant doesn't matter.

426
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,590
What matters is the colony.

427
00:22:21,014 --> 00:22:22,763
He is willing to live for the colony,

428
00:22:23,088 --> 00:22:24,344
to fight for the colony,

429
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,130
to die for the colony.

430
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,923
This guy is crazy.

431
00:22:28,748 --> 00:22:29,804
I hear ya.

432
00:22:29,805 --> 00:22:31,206
At 0800 hours,

433
00:22:31,331 --> 00:22:34,540
we received word that the
termite enemy has mobilized.

434
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:35,908
We have no choice,

435
00:22:35,909 --> 00:22:38,170
but to launch a preemptive strike.

436
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,740
You are the queen's finest.

437
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:43,320
I know you will all do you duty.

438
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:46,890
I am proud, to send you into battle.

439
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:47,905
Into...

440
00:22:48,006 --> 00:22:49,560
I'm sor... I'm sorry. Into battle?

441
00:22:49,561 --> 00:22:51,174
Dismissed.
Left face.

442
00:22:52,199 --> 00:22:53,494
Forward march.

443
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,830
You know, I think
there is been a terrible mistake.

444
00:22:57,054 --> 00:23:00,070
You know, the truth is I just...
I just came for the speech.

445
00:23:00,194 --> 00:23:02,800
Don't worry, kid.
I'll watch out for ya.

446
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,730
Sound off.
One! Two!

447
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:13,680
Sound off.
Three!

448
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:16,180
Sound off.
Five!

449
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:17,350
Six!
Seven!

450
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,600
Eight!

451

Ten!
Eleven!

452
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,230
Twelve!
Thirteen!

453
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:26,090
<i>♪ We ants go marching one by one.
Hurrah, hurrah. ♪</i>

454
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,870
<i>♪ We slaughter termites just for fun.
Hurrah, hurrah. ♪</i>

455
00:23:30,871 --> 00:23:32,870
So, these.. These termites,
they're.. they're...

456
00:23:32,894 --> 00:23:35,129
These guys aren't gonna put up much
of a fight, right? I mean...

457
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:36,570
We're talking pushovers, right?

458
00:23:36,571 --> 00:23:39,290
Not really, kid.
They're five times our size.

459
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,160
And they shoot acid from their foreheads.

460
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:44,460
Hey. Keep it moving, shorty.

461
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:47,780
<i>♪ We ants go marching two by two.
Hurrah, hurrah. ♪</i>

462

Hurrah, hurrah. ♪</i>

463
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,140
He say, what exactly,
what does our platoon do?

464
00:23:56,341 --> 00:23:59,282
I mean, you know, will we be
serving beverages or...

465
00:23:59,283 --> 00:24:00,643
or processing paperwork?

466
00:24:00,644 --> 00:24:02,757
Our platoon has the best assignment of all.

467
00:24:02,822 --> 00:24:04,414
We're the first into battle!

468
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:08,382

471
00:24:15,411 --> 00:24:18,260
Hey. Wait a minute. Let's not get
we're being too hasty here.

472
00:24:18,284 --> 00:24:20,670
These. These guys, sound like bruisers.

473
00:24:20,671 --> 00:24:23,750
What... Just... Just how were you
figuring on beating them?

474
00:24:23,751 --> 00:24:25,517
Superior numbers, kid.

475
00:24:25,642 --> 00:24:28,520
Overwhelm their defenses
and kill their queen.

476
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:32,500
Hey, fellas. That's.
You're being a little extreme, I feel.

477
00:24:32,524 --> 00:24:35,390
Why.. Why don't.. Why don't we try
and influence their political process,

478
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:37,400
with campaign contributions?

479
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,236
I like you, kid.

480
00:24:39,361 --> 00:24:40,940
You got a sense of humor.

481
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:42,770
Forward!
Come on.

482
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,970
Let's kick some termite butt.

483
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:20,940
Where is everyone?
Something is not right.

484
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:24,400
Don't be scared, kid.

485
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,190
Attack!

486
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,300
Come on.

487
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:19,860
Barbatus, you saved my life.

488
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,870
Don't get all sappy about it.

489
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,580
Hey, guys. Look out behind you!

490
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,690
Hey. Hey, guys.

491
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,550
Can somebody help me here?
Can anybody. Hey.

492
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:00,350
Yeah.

493
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:05,049
Ok, mama.

494
00:27:05,474 --> 00:27:06,474
Yeah.

495
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,510
Oh, yeah.
Big guy coming through.

496
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:15,510
I love it.

497
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:23,990
Hey. Hey. Hey.
Take it easy, muscles.

498
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,530
You're making the rest of us look bad.

499
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:30,480
What happened to Z?

500
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:34,910
He is taking a personal day,
so I'm filling in.

501
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:37,680
You fill in any more and you'll explode.

502
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,350
You got a problem?

503
00:27:44,774 --> 00:27:45,774
No...

504
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:49,692
Nobody told me digging was
so much fun you know you...

505
00:27:50,117 --> 00:27:51,320
pick the dirt up.

506
00:27:51,721 --> 00:27:52,721
You move it.

507
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:55,771
You pick it up again.
You move it again.

508
00:27:56,096 --> 00:27:56,922
Lots of reps.

509
00:27:56,923 --> 00:27:59,630
You exercise the arms and the thorax.

510
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,580
Yes, I... I see what you mean.

511
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,040
Yeah. That is fascinating.
Sorry, sir.

512
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:06,740
I was just having
a little chat with my friend, sir.

513
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:10,670
You know, I just had a little chat
with General Mandible.

514
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:15,080
Anybody who doesn't meet his quota
is going to be downsized.

515
00:28:15,504 --> 00:28:16,865
Come on. Cut him a break.

516
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:19,550
He is new.

517
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,680
Hey.

518
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,939
What do you say we help,
your attitude a little bit by...

519
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:28,260
taking away your rations for the day.

520
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:30,660
Thanks for your time.

521
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:34,540
I don't know what came over me.

522
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:36,190
Talking back like that.

523
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:38,630
I must be losing it.

524
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,744
Sorry I got you in trouble
but listen you can...

525
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:44,040
share my rations.

526
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,770
If you want.

527
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,760
Are you asking me out to dinner?

528
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,520
No. I...

529
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:53,267
Well...

530
00:28:53,668 --> 00:28:56,220
if you don't have anything else planned.

531
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,230
I'll check my calendar.

532
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:00,930
You know,

533
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:04,330
I'm kinda glad Z is taking a breather.

534
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:37,730
Kid!

535
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:39,930
Kid, over here.

536
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:43,500
Barbatus.

537
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,617
Be honest, kid.

538
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:47,694
Am I hurt bad?

539
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:50,467
N.. No. Not. Not at all.
You. You're...

540
00:29:50,992 --> 00:29:52,624
Actually, you're looking terrific.

541
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:55,760
You got, you know,
swell color in your cheeks.

542
00:29:56,284 --> 00:29:59,350
No. I can see it in your eyes.

543
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:01,950
I'm a goner.

544
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:04,730
Help me up Z.

545
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:11,200
I can't feel my legs.

546
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:12,849
You gotta hang in there, buddy.

547
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:16,050
You.. You, you know.
I.. I know you're gonna make it.

548
00:30:16,051 --> 00:30:18,850
Just, take, take, take deep breaths.

549
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:22,150
Because I'm, I'm.. I'm.. I'm gonna try
and find your body, its...

550
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:25,680
It's bound to be out there somewhere.

551
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:36,250
Barbatus, han.. hang.. hang on.

552
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,590
Barbatus.
Don't make my mistake, kid.

553
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,200
Don't follow orders your whole life.

554
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:48,370
Think for yourself.

555
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,310
Barbatus.

556
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:11,290
We're on schedule.

557
00:31:11,591 --> 00:31:14,300
Work is completed on A section, sir.

558
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:16,780
We're clearing a path
through D section now.

559
00:31:16,781 --> 00:31:18,292
We need to push harder, Cutter.

560
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:20,110
I want double shifts around the clock.

561
00:31:20,134 --> 00:31:21,930
We can't afford to let up.
Is that clear?

562
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,480
Crystal, sir.
Good.

563
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,178
What about section...

564
00:31:25,479 --> 00:31:26,480
Excuse me, sir.

565
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,630
This had better be important.

566
00:31:28,654 --> 00:31:30,620
Well, it's about the termite battle, sir.

567
00:31:30,844 --> 00:31:32,409
The enemy was destroyed,

568
00:31:32,634 --> 00:31:35,864
but I am afraid it was a disaster
for our troops, as well.

569
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:38,195
Well, that's terrible.

570
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:39,270
Terrible.

571
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:41,148
There is good news, sir.

572
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:42,880
One soldier did make it back.

573
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:44,850
No kidding.
What did you say?

574
00:31:44,851 --> 00:31:46,800
Word is spreading through the colony sir.

575
00:31:46,801 --> 00:31:49,410
And the queen requested a meeting
with the war hero.

576
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,440
Damn!

577
00:31:50,505 --> 00:31:52,200
Good. Damn good.

578
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,100
I'll handle this.

579
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,650
Congratulations, soldier.

580
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:05,090
Well, you're a little short
for a war hero, aren't you?

581
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:06,740
A war hero?

582
00:32:07,165 --> 00:32:11,414
Sir, I... I don't actually
think that I'm a hero.

583
00:32:11,415 --> 00:32:12,151
Good.

584
00:32:12,452 --> 00:32:13,500
I don't like heroes.

585
00:32:13,501 --> 00:32:15,540
But, sir. You don't understand. I...

586
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:25,550
I... I didn't do anything.

587
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:30,040
I mean, it was all horrible.
It was just, just a massacre.

588
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:32,490
A massacre upon a massacre.

589
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:34,540
That's good, soldier.
Now, wave.

590
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:44,320
There was nothing you could do, Weaver.

591
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:46,840
You didn't know they were going to war.

592
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:49,220
I just feel horrible.

593
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:51,120
Poor Z.

594
00:32:51,121 --> 00:32:53,270
I should have never let him go.

595
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:54,950
Wait a minute.

596
00:32:54,951 --> 00:32:57,510
That's no soldier. That's Z!

597
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,090
Z?

598
00:32:59,491 --> 00:33:01,260
The little guy made it!

599
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:07,170
Let's go, soldier.

600
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,606
As I was saying son,

601
00:33:18,607 --> 00:33:20,910
you are an ant after my own heart.

602
00:33:20,934 --> 00:33:24,180
An ant that looks death
in the face and laughs.

603
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:27,483
Actually, the truth is, I... I...

604
00:33:27,508 --> 00:33:29,764
generally just make belittling
comments and...

605
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,740
snicker behind death is back.

606
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,500
General Mandible.

607
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:39,354
Keep your comments to yourself.

608
00:33:39,655 --> 00:33:41,130
Let me do the talking.

609
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,930
May I present.
Her Majesty the Queen.

610
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:54,540
Charmed. Charmed.

611
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,630
And the Royal Princess, Bala.

612
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,210
Welcome home, soldier.

613
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:04,600
We cannot begin to express
our gratitude for your heroic efforts.

614
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:07,880
The private has asked me
to convey his most humble appreciation.

615
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:11,120
Please. Please.
It was nothing really just...

616
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,680
your average run of the mill valor...

617
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:16,420
and extraordinary courageousness,
you know.

618
00:34:16,544 --> 00:34:20,080
In the heat of battle, there is very
little time to think you know.

619
00:34:20,081 --> 00:34:22,880
One must attack! Attack! Attack!

620
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:25,260
Well, indeed.

621
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,988
As you can see, Your Highness,

622
00:34:27,413 --> 00:34:29,594
the battlefield is still
fresh in his mind, so...

623
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:34,310
begging your pardon, but this is
the perfect time to debrief the private.

624
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,099
Please, General.

625
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,810
Not on our first date.

626
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,390
Not on our first date.

627
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:42,510
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?

628
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:46,020
Well, maybe.
Then again, maybe not.

629
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:47,920
And then, then again.

630
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:50,662
That's it!

631
00:34:50,687 --> 00:34:52,500
You're the guy from the bar.

632
00:34:52,624 --> 00:34:53,624
Don't...

633
00:34:53,727 --> 00:34:55,304
Bar? What bar?

634
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:58,600
I danced with this guy at the bar
the other night.

635
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:00,640
He was just a worker then.

636
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:04,310
What were you doing at a bar?
Precisely what I want to know.

637
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:06,350
No. This isn't about me.

638
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:09,610
I mean, look at this worker.
Look what He is done.

639
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:13,070
I think you're thinking of someone else.
After all, I am a soldier.

640
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,180
Exactly.

641
00:35:14,205 --> 00:35:16,054
You were a worker.

642
00:35:16,055 --> 00:35:17,840
But now, you're a war hero.

643
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,452
He is a worker?

644
00:35:20,477 --> 00:35:23,224
A worker danced with my fiancee?

645
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,830
Fi... Fiancee?

646
00:35:25,255 --> 00:35:26,954
Wait. Wait... Wait a minute.

647
00:35:26,978 --> 00:35:29,380
This is not.. This is not how it looks.
I can explain this.

648
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:30,453
This. Hey.

649
00:35:30,454 --> 00:35:32,240
She was the one making all the moves.

650
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:33,840
Arrest him.

651
00:35:34,164 --> 00:35:35,385
Hey. Hey. Hey wait a minute.

652
00:35:35,509 --> 00:35:37,200
Take it easy.
Can't we discuss this?

653
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:38,343
What are you doing?

654
00:35:38,468 --> 00:35:39,774
Let go of my daughter.

655
00:35:39,798 --> 00:35:41,120
He is taking her hostage!

656
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,685
No. No. I'm not. I m.. I mean, yes.

657
00:35:44,686 --> 00:35:45,700
Yes I am.

658
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,490
One more step and then
the princess gets it.

659
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:50,970
Let go of me!

660
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,890
Don't make me hurt her.

661
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:14,270
What are you doing, you creep?

662
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:17,140
Are you out of your puny little mind?

663
00:36:17,141 --> 00:36:18,820
There they are down there! Let's go.

664
00:36:18,821 --> 00:36:20,480
Move. Move. Move. Move. Move.

665
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:22,140
Good.

666
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:24,380
Here they come to rescue me,

667
00:36:24,981 --> 00:36:26,060
and kill you.

668
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:27,060
Kill?

669
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:28,306
Hey, you guys.

670
00:36:28,307 --> 00:36:28,960
Stop it. Stop it.

671
00:36:29,184 --> 00:36:31,060
What are you trying to do?
Get off me, you little twerp!

672
00:36:31,061 --> 00:36:32,061
Wait a minute.
What?

673
00:36:32,062 --> 00:36:33,990
What do you want to do?
Throw away everything we've got?

674
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:37,250
What're you waiting for?

675
00:36:37,674 --> 00:36:39,890
Hello. Guys.

676
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,530
What is it?

677
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:55,470
It's beautiful.

678
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,550
Ridgeway, get out of there!

679
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:42,640
Don't worry. I'm ok.
You?

680
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,591
You're ok?

681
00:37:44,892 --> 00:37:46,710
Hey. Who cares about you?

682
00:37:46,934 --> 00:37:49,110
I almost died here.
Will you please calm down?

683
00:37:49,111 --> 00:37:52,900
You're not gonna let a little near-death
experience ruin your mood, are you?

684
00:37:52,901 --> 00:37:55,219
Hey. This is not a mood. Ok!

685
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:57,064
You're not listening to me.

686
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,040
Where am I?

687
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:05,608
Look, what's your name. Just...

688
00:38:05,633 --> 00:38:08,774
climb up that tree,
and find out where I am.

689
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:11,671
Look, the trick is not to panic.

690
00:38:11,672 --> 00:38:12,210
You know...

691
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,480
you, who panics is lost.

692
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:17,360
What am I saying?
We are lost.

693
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:31,390
I've been kidnapped by the village idiot.

694
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:33,470
Who is the bigger idiot,

695
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:35,950
the idiot or the idiot
who gets kidnapped by the idiot?

696
00:38:36,184 --> 00:38:38,480
What'd you do,
talk those termites to death?

697
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:41,910
I can't believe you tried
to pass yourself off as a soldier.

698
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:44,970
Why are you stalking me?

699
00:38:45,224 --> 00:38:48,590
Don't you realize
that I'm out of your league?

700
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:51,850
You're the one who was cruising the
worker bar looking for a little action.

701
00:38:51,974 --> 00:38:54,030
And you just happened to find it...

702
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:56,067
the swarthy, earthy,

703
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:58,320
sensual worker.

704
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:00,063
Please.

705
00:39:00,188 --> 00:39:01,794
I was slumming it.

706
00:39:02,118 --> 00:39:03,470
Don't you get it?

707
00:39:03,754 --> 00:39:07,690
I chose you because you were the most
pathetic little bug in the joint.

708
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:12,130
You know, I was gonna let you become
part of my most erotic fantasies.

709
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:15,762
But now, you can just forget that.
Write it off, you know.

710
00:39:15,803 --> 00:39:18,603
I.. I guess what you prefer
is Old Blood and Guts.

711
00:39:18,739 --> 00:39:22,980
This guy is idea of a romantic night out
is two seats at a public execution.

712
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:26,360
Boy. You really chose the right husband.

713
00:39:26,384 --> 00:39:31,120
For your information,
the general and I, are deeply,

714
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:33,544
deeply, in...

715
00:39:33,945 --> 00:39:35,200
engaged.

716
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:38,180
You come right back down here
this instant.

717
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:41,760
We are marching straight back
to the colony so that I...

718
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,210
The monolith.

719
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,040
Absolutely. Wonderful. That's an appealing offer.

720
00:39:53,041 --> 00:39:53,760
But...

721
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:56,760
considering the options,
you go back. Ok?

722
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,760
Because I'm going to Insectopia.

723
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,360
Come on. Insectopia?

724
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:04,760
You're crazier than I thought.

725
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:09,020
Yeah. Well, I happen to have it
on a very reliable source.

726
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,670
Or. Or should I say...

727
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:14,210
a drunk-raving source, but...

728
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:17,970
the point is, I'm convinced
the place definitely exists.

729
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:19,178
Stop!

730
00:40:19,479 --> 00:40:22,270
I order you to stop, worker!

731
00:40:22,394 --> 00:40:24,754
Hey. I got a name. Ok?

732
00:40:24,778 --> 00:40:25,865
It's Z.

733
00:40:25,989 --> 00:40:28,631
And out here, you can't order me around.

734
00:40:28,755 --> 00:40:31,570
Alright. Fine. No problem.

735
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:50,630
Worker! Worker!
Where are you?

736
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:52,010
Z?

737
00:40:52,596 --> 00:40:53,596
Z?

738
00:40:53,645 --> 00:40:55,317
Wait for me.

739
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:58,281
No more excuses, General.

740
00:40:58,282 --> 00:40:59,910
I want my daughter back.

741
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,910
Frankly, I'm beginning to doubt
your ability to handle this.

742
00:41:03,934 --> 00:41:05,072
Believe me, Your Highness,

743
00:41:05,073 --> 00:41:07,380
we will spare no effort to bring her back.

744
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:12,300
Princess Bala is essential
to all our plans for the future.

745
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,580
So he kills himself a hundred termites,

746
00:41:16,804 --> 00:41:19,733
gets a few medals,
then bada-bing, bada-bip,

747
00:41:19,858 --> 00:41:21,650
bags himself the princess.

748
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,760
He looks him dead in the eye...
And says, Bite me.

749
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,940
He said that to General Mandible?

750
00:41:26,164 --> 00:41:26,964
Buddy.

751
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:28,580
Hey, hey, buddy.

752
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:30,051
You heard about the war hero,

753
00:41:30,252 --> 00:41:31,400
named Z?

754
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:33,600
Runs off with the princess, right?

755
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:38,330
When they sent the guards after him,
he just looks at them and boom!

756
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,021
They burst into flames.
Z?

757
00:41:40,646 --> 00:41:42,500
You talking about Z?

758
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:44,765
Hey, I know the guy.
He is a friend of mine.

759
00:41:44,766 --> 00:41:46,000
I think your information...

760
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,970
You know Z?
Yeah.

761
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:50,220
He is a worker.
He used to dig around here.

762
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:51,290
A worker?

763
00:41:51,433 --> 00:41:52,738
That's impossible.

764
00:41:52,863 --> 00:41:54,808
A worker can't do anything, except work.

765
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,970
Yeah. It's not like we got a choice.

766
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,683
We do have a choice.

767
00:41:58,684 --> 00:42:00,210
I mean, look at Z.

768
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:02,730
He decided he wanted something,
and he went for it.

769
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,898
He is not alone.

770
00:42:04,123 --> 00:42:05,669
I used to be a soldier,

771
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:07,191
and I switched places with him.

772
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,106
Wait a second.

773
00:42:08,107 --> 00:42:09,222
You're telling me.

774
00:42:09,523 --> 00:42:10,700
I don't have to be here?

775
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:12,110
We've got a choice?

776
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:15,488
The authorities don't want you
to know pal,

777
00:42:15,489 --> 00:42:17,120
but we don't have to work
on the tunnel anymore.

778
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:19,520
It's the workers who control
the means of production.

779
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,730
If Z don't dig, I don't dig.

780
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:23,980
People, what is this?
An encounter group?

781
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:26,108
Let's get back to work.

782
00:42:26,733 --> 00:42:27,733
Why?

783
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:29,163
On the tunnel anymore!

784
00:42:29,288 --> 00:42:30,212
This guy Z.

785
00:42:30,213 --> 00:42:31,620
He is leading the revolution!

786
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:33,950
I'll get back to you.

787
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,383
Think about it Z.

788
00:42:44,684 --> 00:42:45,850
Two ants.

789
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:48,458
Who ever heard of two ants?

790
00:42:48,783 --> 00:42:50,648
Two million ants, maybe.

791
00:42:50,649 --> 00:42:51,424
But two?

792
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:53,971
Look.

793
00:42:54,272 --> 00:42:55,426
I'm hungry.

794
00:42:55,727 --> 00:42:57,080
I'm thirsty.

795
00:42:57,610 --> 00:43:00,170
And this whole desert thing.

796
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,871
It just doesn't work for me.

797
00:43:04,096 --> 00:43:06,400
I think it's about time
for you to take me back.

798
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:08,050
Take yourself back.

799
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:10,565
Excuse me.

800
00:43:10,566 --> 00:43:13,000
You kidnapped me, remember?

801
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,550
That means you have
certain responsibilities.

802
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:19,560
You can't just abandon me
here in the wilderness.

803
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:22,130
Yeah, well, it's better than
being back at the colony.

804
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:23,992
You're not serious, are you?

805
00:43:23,993 --> 00:43:25,440
Maybe you were living the high life,

806
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:27,510
but personally this beats digging.

807
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:30,650
If you'd ever done a day is labor
you'd know what I was talking about.

808
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:34,013
Labor?

809
00:43:34,314 --> 00:43:35,860
What do you know about labor?

810
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:38,380
How would you feel if you
were expected to give birth,

811
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,340
every ten seconds
for the rest of your life?

812
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:42,610
Gee.

813
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:44,620
Water!

814
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:51,760
All you think about is yourself.

815
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,510
Yeah. Well, nobody else
ever thought about me.

816
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:57,470
So as far as I'm concerned,
I don't need anybody else.

817
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:01,770
Help! Help me, Bala!

818
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:06,007
Help!

819
00:44:06,008 --> 00:44:07,180
B-B-Ba-B-Bala!

820
00:44:07,181 --> 00:44:08,049
Ba-B-Ba-Bal!

821
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:08,849
Bala!

822
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:10,440
Hold on. I'll get you out.
Hold on.

823
00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:13,260
Help, Ba-Bal-Ba.

824
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:35,710
Thanks.

825
00:44:35,791 --> 00:44:37,384
Don't mention it.

826
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:41,410
Now, maybe we can put
this fantasy behind us...

827
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:43,920
and head back to the colon...

828
00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:46,128
Oh, Z!

829
00:44:46,129 --> 00:44:47,620
What are you doing?

830
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:49,775
We've gotta cross the lake.

831
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:51,794
Am I missing something here?

832
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:54,230
Didn't we just get out of the water?

833
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,910
Bala, look, what have you got to lose?

834
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,607
I mean, think about it.

835
00:45:00,832 --> 00:45:04,464
Do you really want to be Mrs.
Raving Lunatic?

836
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:09,380
There is a better place.

837
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:12,710
Z, please.

838
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:14,773
Just...

839
00:45:14,774 --> 00:45:16,160
Give me one chance.

840
00:45:16,330 --> 00:45:18,260
If we don't find Insectopia soon,

841
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:21,220
I promise I'll take you back
to the colony.

842
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:38,840
I hope you know what you're doing.

843
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:40,540
Yeah, me too.

844
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:52,710
We want Z! We want Z!

845
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:54,340
People, come on.

846
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:57,420
I know some ants who aren't
gonna make their quota.

847
00:45:57,750 --> 00:46:00,060
Buzz off, pawn of the oppressor.

848
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:04,250
We want Z! We want Z!

849
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:08,547
Sorry, sir.
I came as soon as I heard.

850
00:46:08,772 --> 00:46:10,464
I was debriefing the trackers.

851
00:46:10,510 --> 00:46:11,804
And what's the report?

852
00:46:12,329 --> 00:46:14,044
Well, this Z, sir...

853
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,070
He is one slippery character.

854
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:17,875
They lost Bala's trail,

855
00:46:18,376 --> 00:46:19,770
at the edge of the lake.

856
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:20,840
The lake?

857
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:24,620
<i>♪ All we are saying ♪</i>

858
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:28,120
<i>♪ Is give Z a chance ♪</i>

859
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,660
What's that soldier doing there?

860
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:33,233
It appears He is holding hands, sir...

861
00:46:33,858 --> 00:46:34,994
with a worker.

862
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:37,730
I don't like the way
things are going, Cutter.

863
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:40,770
I'm counting on you for results.

864
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:42,802
Now, can I depend on you or not?

865
00:46:42,903 --> 00:46:43,910
Yes, sir.

866
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:45,890
Alright, then.
Let's wrap this up.

867
00:46:45,891 --> 00:46:51,869
We want Z! We want Z! We want Z!
We want Z! We want Z! We want Z!

868
00:46:51,870 --> 00:46:54,410
I've heard a lot about this Z.

869
00:46:56,470 --> 00:46:58,090
I even had the pleasure,

870
00:46:58,791 --> 00:47:00,440
of meeting him once.

871
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:03,460
But where is he now?

872
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:06,240
Can anyone point him out?

873
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:11,320
I mean, if this Z
cares so much about us,

874
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:13,900
then why isn't he here?

875
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:16,889
I'll tell you why.

876
00:47:17,114 --> 00:47:20,374
Because Z doesn't give
a damn about us.

877
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:24,734
That's why he kidnapped our princess.

878
00:47:25,059 --> 00:47:26,574
That's why he ran away.

879
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:29,701
Z is no hero.

880
00:47:30,102 --> 00:47:31,620
We are the heroes.

881
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:36,120
We are the ones ensuring
the future of our great colony.

882
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:40,500
And when we've completed
this magnificent structure,

883
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:42,790
we will reap the benefits.

884
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:46,270
More food and less work for everyone.

885
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:50,610
And as further reward
for your heroic efforts,

886
00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:53,540
each and every one of you
will get the day off,

887
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:57,561
so you can be the guests of honor,

888
00:47:57,762 --> 00:48:00,910
at the Mega Tunnel
dedication ceremonies!

889
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,220
Mandible! Mandible!

890
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:17,469
Mandible! Mandible! Mandible! Mandible!

891
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:19,620
Now bring me that soldier.

892
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,731
Oh, my God!

893
00:49:03,032 --> 00:49:04,730
Z! Come here!

894
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:21,300
It's Insectopia!

895
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:27,940
You were right.
It really is here.

896
00:49:41,590 --> 00:49:43,600
Alright. Alright!

897
00:49:43,970 --> 00:49:45,740
You're a genius.
Let's eat.

898
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,663
Well.

899
00:49:59,664 --> 00:50:01,080
What's the problem?

900
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:02,870
There is some kind of force field.

901
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:08,528
Ex.. Exc.. Excuse me.

902
00:50:09,053 --> 00:50:09,939
Excuse me.

903
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:11,704
Ho.. How.. How do you get in?

904
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:17,920
Yeah, well, I'm, I'm afraid
this is a private function.

905
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:20,294
Who are your friends, dear?

906
00:50:20,519 --> 00:50:22,794
Crawling insects, poopsie.

907
00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:25,240
The poor dears.

908
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:29,600
Good morning.

909
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,250
Darling, really.

910
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:35,890
Greeting every insect
that emerges out of the grass?

911
00:50:36,030 --> 00:50:37,125
Pardon me.

912
00:50:37,450 --> 00:50:40,334
I guess you don't recognize me.

913
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:45,948
I've been traveling and I'm all...

914
00:50:45,949 --> 00:50:47,200
schlumpy.

915
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:49,510
I'm Princess Bala.

916
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:52,639
It's even worse.

917
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:54,270
They're Eurotrash.

918
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:56,222
Darling, they're poor.

919
00:50:56,223 --> 00:50:58,490
They're dirty. They're smelly.

920
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,620
We have to help them.

921
00:51:01,450 --> 00:51:05,260
If you'll just wait right here,
we'll fetch you a little something.

922
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:08,920
Please, Muffy.
Not another crusade.

923
00:51:09,090 --> 00:51:13,100
Chippie, we have a social obligation
to the less fortunate.

924
00:51:14,230 --> 00:51:18,580
I know you laugh at my hobbies,
but this is important to me!

925
00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:21,580
You have such a big heart.

926
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:24,760
That's why you're
my little cuddly-widdles.

927
00:51:25,730 --> 00:51:29,850
My big strong pheromone factory.

928
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:34,632
Oh, brother.

929
00:51:34,733 --> 00:51:36,590
Suddenly I've lost my appetite.

930
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,430
You know...

931
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,080
I guess I had imagined Insectopia...

932
00:51:42,590 --> 00:51:44,300
I don't know, a little differently.

933
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:51,960
Muffy!

934
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:52,798
No!

935
00:51:53,799 --> 00:51:54,810
No.

936
00:51:58,230 --> 00:51:59,130
Look out!

937
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:04,775
Z, help me!

938
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:06,800
Z!

939
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:09,770
Don't let me...
Don't let me go, Z.

940
00:52:14,330 --> 00:52:17,300
Get me out of here!

941
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:22,810
Bala!

942
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:32,490
This is not good.

943
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:28,170
Hi.

944
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:36,750
Z?

945
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:37,930
Yes?

946
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:39,350
It looks like this is it,

947
00:53:39,651 --> 00:53:40,693
just when...

948
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:43,124
I was starting to like you.

949
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:55,280
Who the hell is that?

950
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,640
That's enough.

951
00:54:11,070 --> 00:54:13,790
I ain't telling you nothing.

952
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:15,046
Soldier,

953
00:54:15,647 --> 00:54:19,200
the princess is vital,
to the future of this colony.

954
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:22,590
She must be returned
to take her proper place as queen.

955
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,930
We already have a queen.

956
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:28,620
As for your friend Z,
why should I hurt him?

957
00:54:29,690 --> 00:54:30,990
He is not important.

958
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,010
Now soldier,

959
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:37,480
we all know that one individual ant
doesn't matter.

960
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:40,100
You...

961
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:42,300
not Cutter...

962
00:54:44,270 --> 00:54:45,440
Not even her.

963
00:54:45,870 --> 00:54:46,930
Azteca!

964
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:50,370
Don't tell that tight-ass
anything, Weaver!

965
00:54:51,550 --> 00:54:53,080
Where is Z?

966
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:54,760
I don't know where he is!

967
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:57,640
That's too bad.

968
00:55:05,790 --> 00:55:06,790
Wait!

969
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:08,870
Insectopia.

970
00:55:09,810 --> 00:55:11,318
I know it sounds crazy,

971
00:55:11,319 --> 00:55:12,770
but that's where he'd be going.

972
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:15,327
Soldier, you think this is a game?

973
00:55:15,551 --> 00:55:18,220
Insectopia does not exist.

974
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:19,556
As a matter of fact...

975
00:55:20,681 --> 00:55:21,681
it does.

976
00:55:22,064 --> 00:55:23,064
Sir?

977
00:55:23,088 --> 00:55:24,845
I'll brief you on the coordinates.

978
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,750
You're gonna bring the princess back.

979
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:28,790
And as for Z...

980
00:55:29,415 --> 00:55:30,415
kill him.

981
00:55:31,450 --> 00:55:34,260
But you said he didn't matter.

982
00:55:34,284 --> 00:55:35,760
It's for the good of the colony.

983
00:55:36,485 --> 00:55:38,024
You made the right decision.

984
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,087
Gentlemen,

985
00:55:41,512 --> 00:55:45,640
now you can see how dangerous
individualism can be.

986
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:47,758
It makes us...

987
00:55:48,059 --> 00:55:49,330
vulnerable.

988
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:51,910
Let's go.

989
00:55:54,890 --> 00:55:56,481
Take him back to the Mega Tunnel.

990
00:55:57,106 --> 00:55:58,564
Put him on the front line.

991
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:01,540
Dismissed.

992
00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:12,728
Jeez, what was I thinking?

993
00:56:12,829 --> 00:56:14,840
I almost got you killed.

994
00:56:15,070 --> 00:56:16,968
Z, you know,

995
00:56:16,969 --> 00:56:18,960
you really shouldn't be so hard on...

996
00:56:19,030 --> 00:56:20,035
That's it.

997
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:22,974
I'm taking you back to the colony.

998
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:29,720
Insectopia. You know, I..
I must've been crazy.

999
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:30,551
Z.

1000
00:56:30,552 --> 00:56:31,537
But you know what?

1001
00:56:31,562 --> 00:56:33,084
I can admit it when I'm wrong.
Z.

1002
00:56:33,130 --> 00:56:37,350
And this time, I gotta tell ya,
I was.. I was absolutely, 100 %...

1003
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:39,720
correct.

1004
00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:41,994
Have...

1005
00:56:42,695 --> 00:56:44,121
Have you ever seen anything...

1006
00:56:44,422 --> 00:56:46,730
more beautiful in your life?

1007
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:48,991
It's... Insect...

1008
00:56:49,316 --> 00:56:50,573
Don't jinx it.

1009
00:56:50,874 --> 00:56:51,874
Come on!

1010
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:22,260
Pardon us.

1011
00:58:16,290 --> 00:58:17,480
Alright, everybody.

1012
00:58:17,604 --> 00:58:19,200
I want all teams in place,

1013
00:58:19,530 --> 00:58:21,330
fully prepared, ready to seal the doors,

1014
00:58:21,597 --> 00:58:23,134
here and here.

1015
00:58:24,290 --> 00:58:27,408
Make certain the digging crew stays
on schedule for breakthrough,

1016
00:58:27,532 --> 00:58:29,344
midway in the dedication ceremony.

1017
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,290
Now all we need is the princess.

1018
00:59:01,650 --> 00:59:03,597
This stuff tastes like crap.

1019
00:59:03,621 --> 00:59:05,814
Really? Let me try some.

1020
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:09,176
Hey, it is crap.

1021
00:59:09,901 --> 00:59:10,901
Not bad.

1022
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:14,004
Somebody needs to feed that fire.

1023
00:59:14,015 --> 00:59:16,410
Dude, I did it last time.

1024
00:59:16,550 --> 00:59:17,932
I'm not gonna get it.

1025
00:59:17,933 --> 00:59:19,250
It's not my job.

1026
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:21,252
What about the new guy?

1027
00:59:21,353 --> 00:59:23,260
He hasn't contributed yet.

1028
00:59:24,090 --> 00:59:24,890
And...

1029
00:59:25,430 --> 00:59:28,174
you know he just died
in my arms like that, I...

1030
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:30,414
I.. You know, I.. I...

1031
00:59:30,415 --> 00:59:32,770
I don't think he ever, once in his life...

1032
00:59:33,150 --> 00:59:34,550
made his own choice.

1033
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:37,980
I never knew it was like that.

1034
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:40,360
I mean up in the palace.

1035
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:42,011
Well,

1036
00:59:42,512 --> 00:59:45,260
I guess we just let the general
make all the decisions.

1037
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:49,120
Let me ask you something.

1038
00:59:49,545 --> 00:59:52,220
What made you come
to the bar that night?

1039
00:59:53,350 --> 00:59:55,730
I guess I was looking for a little trouble.

1040
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:56,953
Well...

1041
00:59:56,954 --> 00:59:58,580
trouble is my middle name.

1042
00:59:59,250 --> 01:00:01,230
Actually, my middle name is Marion but...

1043
01:00:02,510 --> 01:00:05,090
I don't want you to spread that around.
You're pretty strange.

1044
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:07,206
You do know that, don't you?

1045
01:00:07,207 --> 01:00:07,720
Well...

1046
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:11,110
strange is not exactly the word
I would use, you know.

1047
01:00:11,230 --> 01:00:12,161
I like it.

1048
01:00:12,562 --> 01:00:14,450
You're not like anyone else.

1049
01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:16,796
Actually, now that you mention it, I...

1050
01:00:16,797 --> 01:00:19,863
There is a certain strangeness to me.
I mean it's...

1051
01:00:19,964 --> 01:00:24,030
it's... you know, kind of a bizarre quality.
Some have said... freak.

1052
01:00:24,150 --> 01:00:25,511
But, but it's...

1053
01:00:25,812 --> 01:00:26,870
you know complimentary.

1054
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:32,304
Hey new guy.

1055
01:00:33,069 --> 01:00:34,444
We need more wood.

1056
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:37,958
I'll be right back.

1057
01:00:37,959 --> 01:00:39,950
Just hold that thought,

1058
01:00:40,030 --> 01:00:41,790
Whatever, whatever it is you were thinking.

1059
01:00:43,470 --> 01:00:46,130
Hey, you ever wonder why
they call you guys, pests?

1060
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:51,030
What if, like, we're just these
tiny little things...

1061
01:00:51,310 --> 01:00:55,150
and we're just, like part of
this whole other huge universe...

1062
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:59,330
that's, like so big,
we don't even know it exists?

1063
01:00:59,610 --> 01:01:02,690
Man, that is so deep.

1064
01:01:03,030 --> 01:01:06,080
Perfect. Nothing like a little manual labor...

1065
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:08,210
on the most romantic night of my life.

1066
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:14,998
Hi.

1067
01:01:15,399 --> 01:01:18,740
I was in the neighborhood
and I thought I'd drop in.

1068
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:21,044
This is...

1069
01:01:22,069 --> 01:01:23,350
very bohemian.

1070
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:25,720
Aloha, dude. Welcome to Insec...

1071
01:01:28,550 --> 01:01:30,940
Sorry, for interrupting.

1072
01:01:32,510 --> 01:01:35,570
You see, our princess has...

1073
01:01:35,795 --> 01:01:37,524
gone missing and,

1074
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:39,630
we're just sick about it.

1075
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:42,784
SHe is about yea tall,

1076
01:01:42,785 --> 01:01:44,940
fairly easy on the eyes.

1077
01:01:45,110 --> 01:01:47,076
Anybody seen her?

1078
01:01:47,377 --> 01:01:48,460
That's her.

1079
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:52,012
Don't worry, Princess,

1080
01:01:52,013 --> 01:01:53,780
you'll be back home soon.

1081
01:01:53,950 --> 01:01:55,700
Listen Cutter, I'm...

1082
01:01:56,101 --> 01:01:57,180
I'm not going back.

1083
01:01:57,410 --> 01:01:59,334
The thing is, Princess,

1084
01:01:59,659 --> 01:02:00,950
I got orders.

1085
01:02:01,090 --> 01:02:02,145
Orders?

1086
01:02:02,170 --> 01:02:05,134
Can't you just once think for yourself?

1087
01:02:06,770 --> 01:02:09,287
Well, that was very impressive.

1088
01:02:09,612 --> 01:02:10,824
Wher.. Where is Z?

1089
01:02:11,850 --> 01:02:14,030
Z? He is... He is...
Dead.

1090
01:02:15,460 --> 01:02:16,680
Z is dead.

1091
01:02:17,005 --> 01:02:19,040
You don't need to worry about him.

1092
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:20,375
Z is dead?

1093
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:23,514
He was an ant with ideas.

1094
01:02:24,370 --> 01:02:25,570
Too bad for him.

1095
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,800
Princess, your colony needs you.

1096
01:02:29,970 --> 01:02:31,330
Cutter!

1097
01:02:31,410 --> 01:02:34,250
Stop right now! Let go of me!
Bala!

1098
01:02:34,790 --> 01:02:35,941
Stop, you...

1099
01:02:36,866 --> 01:02:37,880
Oh, no.

1100
01:02:38,810 --> 01:02:40,260
What am I gonna do?

1101
01:02:41,330 --> 01:02:44,360
Alright, look. look.
Let's.. Let's be rational about this.

1102
01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:46,204
You know, Bala and I,

1103
01:02:46,205 --> 01:02:48,371
you know, sHe is a princess and I'm...

1104
01:02:48,372 --> 01:02:51,140
I'm a soil-relocation engineer.

1105
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:52,370
So wha... You're no...

1106
01:02:53,390 --> 01:02:54,463
In the other hand...

1107
01:02:55,488 --> 01:02:57,514
I've gotta go back for her.

1108
01:02:57,770 --> 01:03:00,300
I'll... I'll give you a lift.

1109
01:03:04,110 --> 01:03:06,010
It's the least I can do.

1110
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:07,621
Besides,

1111
01:03:08,422 --> 01:03:12,100
it's what my waddly-kiddles would want.

1112
01:03:14,830 --> 01:03:15,830
Look...

1113
01:03:15,998 --> 01:03:17,924
How.. how about a cup of joe first?

1114
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:19,502
Well old boy.
Ok. You know. I...

1115
01:03:19,503 --> 01:03:21,530
I think I saw a puddle of coffee over there.
Saddle up.

1116
01:03:30,260 --> 01:03:31,390
Look out!

1117
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:37,260
Princess.

1118
01:03:37,430 --> 01:03:38,383
You're just in time.

1119
01:03:38,384 --> 01:03:40,110
Take your hands off me.

1120
01:03:40,940 --> 01:03:43,700
General, what exactly is going on here?

1121
01:03:43,770 --> 01:03:47,640
I demand an explanation.
I'll explain everything, afterwards.

1122
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:49,950
Is the southeast entrance secure?
Yes, sir.

1123
01:03:50,820 --> 01:03:53,000
Not afterwards. Now.

1124
01:03:56,710 --> 01:03:58,461
I don't like the way you think,

1125
01:03:58,462 --> 01:04:00,810
and I don't like the way you run
this colony.

1126
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:02,705
And I don't like you.

1127
01:04:02,706 --> 01:04:04,070
The wedding is off.

1128
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:06,580
Things are going to change around here.

1129
01:04:07,205 --> 01:04:08,514
You're right, Princess.

1130
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:10,589
Things are going to change.

1131
01:04:10,914 --> 01:04:12,784
Why don't we make her
more comfortable?

1132
01:04:13,130 --> 01:04:15,140
She'll be here for a while.

1133
01:04:16,810 --> 01:04:18,427
What do you think you're doing?

1134
01:04:18,751 --> 01:04:20,834
My mother will have your head.

1135
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:22,088
I doubt that.

1136
01:04:23,713 --> 01:04:26,135
You've got a fighter spirit, Bala.

1137
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:29,200
And that's just what we need
to start our new colony.

1138
01:04:29,730 --> 01:04:32,370
We will rinse away
all the filth from our gutters.

1139
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:33,584
We'll start a new,

1140
01:04:33,885 --> 01:04:36,070
with you by my side as my queen.

1141
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:38,130
You're crazy.

1142
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:42,820
I believe history will see things differently.

1143
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:46,420
Alright, gentlemen.
Time to take your positions.

1144
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:48,079
Someday.

1145
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:49,930
Someday you'll thank me.

1146
01:05:00,020 --> 01:05:01,020
Pull up!

1147
01:05:02,489 --> 01:05:03,524
There it is!

1148
01:05:08,110 --> 01:05:09,023
Well then,

1149
01:05:09,224 --> 01:05:11,270
go get the woman you love, Z.

1150
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:13,615
So long, Chip.

1151
01:05:13,916 --> 01:05:14,970
And thanks.

1152
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:21,396
You there?

1153
01:05:21,397 --> 01:05:22,790
Where do you think you're going?

1154
01:05:22,914 --> 01:05:24,874
Me? Oh, no, I was just...

1155
01:05:25,099 --> 01:05:27,490
You know, I...
You're not supposed to be out here.

1156
01:05:28,170 --> 01:05:31,200
All workers are to report to
the tunnel-opening ceremonies.

1157
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:34,400
Yes, yes, of course.
The tunnel-opening ceremonies.

1158
01:05:34,424 --> 01:05:37,098
I... Well, I.. I should get going then.

1159
01:05:37,099 --> 01:05:39,085
I... You know, the, the...

1160
01:05:40,210 --> 01:05:41,010
Hey!

1161
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:44,400
Tunnel... I'm going to the tunnel
opening ceremonies.

1162
01:05:44,624 --> 01:05:46,140
Get moving.
I'd better get going.

1163
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:49,160
I'm going to the...
The tunnel-opening ceremonies. I...

1164
01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:54,450
Excuse me, please.
Tunnel-opening ceremonies.

1165
01:05:54,490 --> 01:05:56,329
Hey, worker!
Opening the tunnel.

1166
01:05:56,330 --> 01:05:57,330
They need me.

1167
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:58,747
I'm the key man.

1168
01:05:58,748 --> 01:06:01,060
Where do you think you're going?
Tunnel-opening ceremonies.

1169
01:06:03,950 --> 01:06:06,502
Hey, come on!

1170
01:06:06,703 --> 01:06:08,320
Let me outta here!

1171
01:06:08,490 --> 01:06:09,490
Hey!

1172
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:19,820
Gosh, this-this day just keeps
getting better and better.

1173
01:06:20,090 --> 01:06:22,500
I mean big trouble!

1174
01:06:23,970 --> 01:06:26,400
Are you listening to me out there?

1175
01:06:26,401 --> 01:06:28,040
I'm the princess!

1176
01:06:28,310 --> 01:06:29,340
Damn it!

1177
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:35,816
Your manners haven't improved much.

1178
01:06:35,817 --> 01:06:36,510
Z.

1179
01:06:39,990 --> 01:06:40,990
It's you.

1180
01:06:41,338 --> 01:06:42,870
You came back for me.

1181
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,448
Well, yeah, I came back for you.
You know I...

1182
01:06:45,449 --> 01:06:47,970
Have strong feelings for you.

1183
01:06:48,050 --> 01:06:49,794
Let's face it, you're, you're...

1184
01:06:49,795 --> 01:06:51,280
you're beautiful. I...

1185
01:06:51,910 --> 01:06:52,368
A little...

1186
01:06:52,369 --> 01:06:54,351
combative at times, but...

1187
01:06:54,652 --> 01:06:56,360
I think we can work on that.

1188
01:06:56,361 --> 01:06:57,560
You talk too much.

1189
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:04,710
Gee, I think I'm about to become
the strong, silent type.

1190
01:07:06,380 --> 01:07:07,307
Come on.

1191
01:07:07,408 --> 01:07:08,713
The city is deserted.

1192
01:07:09,014 --> 01:07:10,290
We'd better get outta here.

1193
01:07:10,414 --> 01:07:11,214
Z.

1194
01:07:12,212 --> 01:07:13,413
We can't go.

1195
01:07:13,414 --> 01:07:15,200
Mandible is insane. He...

1196
01:07:15,701 --> 01:07:17,124
He keeps talking about...

1197
01:07:17,580 --> 01:07:19,424
washing away the filth and,

1198
01:07:19,425 --> 01:07:21,030
and changing history and...

1199
01:07:21,860 --> 01:07:23,930
And I think He is going to try
to kill my mother.

1200
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:26,110
Not just your mother,

1201
01:07:26,711 --> 01:07:27,760
everyone.

1202
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:28,772
What's going on?

1203
01:07:28,773 --> 01:07:29,560
Look.

1204
01:07:30,330 --> 01:07:32,050
Here we are, safe in the city.

1205
01:07:32,274 --> 01:07:34,620
But they're gonna seal everybody
off in the Mega Tunnel.

1206
01:07:35,090 --> 01:07:35,533
And...

1207
01:07:36,134 --> 01:07:37,260
here is the lake.

1208
01:07:38,190 --> 01:07:39,280
You're right.

1209
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:41,490
We can't leave now.

1210
01:07:43,220 --> 01:07:44,630
Come on.
We gotta get down there.

1211
01:07:45,260 --> 01:07:48,470
Today is the realization, of a dream.

1212
01:07:49,394 --> 01:07:51,200
A dream of a proud colony.

1213
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:53,069
A pure colony.

1214
01:07:53,794 --> 01:07:55,944
A colony, reborn.

1215
01:08:00,470 --> 01:08:01,699
Moments from now,

1216
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:03,610
this tunnel will open.

1217
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:06,587
The past will be washed away,

1218
01:08:06,888 --> 01:08:08,440
and a new day will dawn.

1219
01:08:10,510 --> 01:08:12,510
A stirring speech, General.

1220
01:08:13,580 --> 01:08:15,830
I only wish my daughter
were here to appreciate it.

1221
01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:18,910
Your Majesty, I know
how concerned you are about Bala.

1222
01:08:19,380 --> 01:08:22,570
But my scouts are on her trail
and it's only a matter of time before...

1223
01:08:22,594 --> 01:08:24,350
General, I don't want to discuss it.

1224
01:08:24,651 --> 01:08:25,710
Just find her.

1225
01:08:26,230 --> 01:08:27,530
I will, Your Highness.

1226
01:08:29,010 --> 01:08:30,180
Good-bye.

1227
01:08:46,530 --> 01:08:47,920
Seal up the doors.

1228
01:08:48,644 --> 01:08:50,310
Cutter, did you hear me?

1229
01:08:50,735 --> 01:08:53,074
Sir, I've been thinking.

1230
01:08:54,020 --> 01:08:55,477
Do we need to go through with this?

1231
01:08:55,901 --> 01:08:57,994
Look at what these workers have done.

1232
01:08:58,218 --> 01:08:59,776
They got the right stuff.

1233
01:09:00,301 --> 01:09:02,294
Isn't there any other way?

1234
01:09:02,550 --> 01:09:04,104
Cutter, you're a fine officer.

1235
01:09:04,128 --> 01:09:06,834
You have discipline, courage, ability.

1236
01:09:07,390 --> 01:09:11,410
But you seem to have a weakness for
the lower orders that I find disturbing.

1237
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:13,827
Now, are you with me?
Sir.

1238
01:09:14,552 --> 01:09:15,944
I apologize.

1239
01:09:16,168 --> 01:09:17,334
Alright, then.

1240
01:09:17,335 --> 01:09:19,390
Seal it up.
Yes, sir.

1241
01:09:32,490 --> 01:09:35,040
As I look out
on this magnificent tunnel,

1242
01:09:35,410 --> 01:09:38,180
I am filled with pride.

1243
01:09:38,210 --> 01:09:38,918
Jump!

1244
01:09:39,119 --> 01:09:40,880
In these difficult times,

1245
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:44,750
it is a great solace to know
that you, our workers...

1246
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:46,850
Mom! Wait!

1247
01:09:47,230 --> 01:09:49,135
Every worker in the colony is here.

1248
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:51,764
Hey, wait a minute.
That guy owes me money.

1249
01:09:51,810 --> 01:09:55,410
This tremendous accomplishment
is a testimony to the strength...

1250
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:57,350
Put your backs into it!
Go warn your mother.

1251
01:09:57,474 --> 01:09:59,644
I gotta get to those diggers
before they break through.

1252
01:09:59,768 --> 01:10:01,194
There is not enough time.

1253
01:10:01,218 --> 01:10:03,740
Hey, leave the pessimism to me, ok?

1254
01:10:08,580 --> 01:10:09,580
Excuse me!

1255
01:10:09,755 --> 01:10:11,204
Sorry about that. Excuse me.

1256
01:10:11,250 --> 01:10:14,510
In a few moments when our expert diggers
break through to the surface,

1257
01:10:14,590 --> 01:10:15,226
Mom!

1258
01:10:15,227 --> 01:10:17,100
The sun will pour into this...
Mom, stop.

1259
01:10:17,670 --> 01:10:20,060
Bala! Where've you been?
Are you alright?

1260
01:10:20,130 --> 01:10:21,130
I'm fine.

1261
01:10:21,877 --> 01:10:23,095
What happened?

1262
01:10:23,096 --> 01:10:25,380
Mother, we're in terrible danger.

1263
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:39,150
Put your backs into it, people.

1264
01:10:39,820 --> 01:10:42,420
Wait! Hold...
Hey, stop digging!

1265
01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:45,340
Z? Is that you?
We must stop!

1266
01:10:45,370 --> 01:10:46,980
Z! You're back!

1267
01:10:47,450 --> 01:10:48,810
Oh, Z!
Weaver!

1268
01:10:49,750 --> 01:10:50,373
Z!

1269
01:10:51,074 --> 01:10:52,270
What's the matter?

1270
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:54,594
Ho.. Hol.. Hold up, everyone.

1271
01:10:54,595 --> 01:10:56,390
Stop. Stop digging.

1272
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:57,547
On whose authority?

1273
01:10:57,548 --> 01:10:59,020
On your own authority.

1274
01:10:59,260 --> 01:11:01,480
If you break through that wall,
we're all gonna...

1275
01:11:01,550 --> 01:11:02,208
Drown.

1276
01:11:02,209 --> 01:11:03,980
This tunnel is going to flood.

1277
01:11:04,150 --> 01:11:06,210
So we've got to get
everyone out of here.

1278
01:11:08,470 --> 01:11:10,380
Look, I got orders,

1279
01:11:10,581 --> 01:11:12,050
and those orders say dig.

1280
01:11:12,051 --> 01:11:14,240
What if someone ordered you
to jump off a bridge?

1281
01:11:15,860 --> 01:11:17,873
Oh, brother, I'm asking
the wrong guy here.

1282
01:11:18,398 --> 01:11:20,414
Look, think for yourselves!

1283
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:21,963
Give me that!

1284
01:11:21,964 --> 01:11:23,330
I've had enough out of you.

1285
01:11:23,910 --> 01:11:25,340
Get back to work.

1286
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:27,340
What's that noise?

1287
01:11:31,330 --> 01:11:32,950
Let's get outta here!
Run!

1288
01:11:35,670 --> 01:11:37,350
Run! Keep going!

1289
01:11:38,090 --> 01:11:39,763
Everyone, listen to me.

1290
01:11:40,064 --> 01:11:41,590
We've all been deceived.

1291
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:46,100
We need to calmly head toward the exits.

1292
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:48,077
Run for your lives! It's gonna flood!

1293
01:11:48,078 --> 01:11:49,690
No. Don't panic.

1294
01:11:49,770 --> 01:11:50,766
Don't panic!

1295
01:11:51,367 --> 01:11:53,110
Every ant for himself!

1296
01:12:02,190 --> 01:12:04,520
All the exits are blocked!
We're trapped!

1297
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:31,720
What are we going to do?
There is nothing we can do!

1298
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:39,876
Yes, there is.

1299
01:12:40,077 --> 01:12:41,430
Weaver, give me a leg up.

1300
01:12:41,860 --> 01:12:44,650
Everyone, listen to me!

1301
01:12:44,990 --> 01:12:46,431
Who the heck are you?

1302
01:12:46,655 --> 01:12:47,655
He is Z!

1303
01:12:47,956 --> 01:12:51,159
He is Z. He is Z. He is Z.

1304
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:55,589
Listen, we gotta help each other
get outta here, before we all drown.

1305
01:12:55,590 --> 01:12:57,780
How?
By making a ladder.

1306
01:12:57,960 --> 01:12:58,980
A ladder!
Hey.

1307
01:12:59,050 --> 01:13:01,500
If we built this, we can do anything.

1308
01:13:02,170 --> 01:13:03,961
Ok, let's move it!
I'm on it.

1309
01:13:03,986 --> 01:13:05,520
All of you, gather round.

1310
01:13:05,550 --> 01:13:07,090
You, start climbing.

1311
01:13:08,260 --> 01:13:10,990
Grab my arm.
Alright. Here I go.
Come on.

1312
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:13,100
Go, go, go!
Right!

1313
01:13:15,850 --> 01:13:17,430
Excuse me, Your Majesty.

1314
01:13:19,610 --> 01:13:22,130
Z, I've gotta help my Mom.

1315
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:25,810
Don't worry. I know almost
exactly what I'm doing.

1316
01:13:28,820 --> 01:13:30,220
I'll see you at the top.

1317
01:13:34,190 --> 01:13:36,880
Gentlemen, there comes a time,

1318
01:13:37,460 --> 01:13:39,990
in the evolution of a perfect colony,

1319
01:13:40,670 --> 01:13:43,680
when the strong are meant
to rise above the weak.

1320
01:13:45,170 --> 01:13:47,170
Now is that time.

1321
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:49,940
Below us right now,

1322
01:13:50,010 --> 01:13:52,710
the weak elements of the colony,

1323
01:13:53,020 --> 01:13:54,580
are being washed away.

1324
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:59,820
Oh, my God, we're not gonna make it!

1325
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:01,025
We need more ants.

1326
01:14:01,326 --> 01:14:02,950
You two better get up there.

1327
01:14:03,070 --> 01:14:05,210
Weaver, you can't hold it alone.

1328
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:06,910
Get going.

1329
01:14:07,990 --> 01:14:09,410
Hang in there, buddy.

1330
01:14:24,170 --> 01:14:26,670
Got it!
Hurry up! Go, go, go, go!

1331
01:14:30,550 --> 01:14:32,283
Our princess is secured,

1332
01:14:32,284 --> 01:14:34,480
and our glorious future is at hand.

1333
01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:36,610
We can all stand proud.

1334
01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:40,010
It is time for a new beginning.

1335
01:14:52,270 --> 01:14:53,770
What the hell is that?

1336
01:14:54,140 --> 01:14:56,210
I think that's the weak element, sir.

1337
01:14:56,290 --> 01:14:58,012
Give me. Give me a hand!

1338
01:14:58,013 --> 01:14:58,856
Z.

1339
01:14:58,957 --> 01:14:59,870
You!

1340
01:15:00,340 --> 01:15:01,341
Let go!

1341
01:15:02,442 --> 01:15:03,683
Don't you understand?

1342
01:15:03,884 --> 01:15:05,250
It's for the good of the colony.

1343
01:15:05,330 --> 01:15:06,595
What.. What are you saying?

1344
01:15:06,896 --> 01:15:08,280
We are the colony!

1345
01:15:12,432 --> 01:15:13,432
Cutter!

1346
01:15:14,056 --> 01:15:16,551
What are you doing?
Something I should've done,

1347
01:15:16,552 --> 01:15:18,130
a long time ago.

1348
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:21,250
This is for the good of the colony, sir.

1349
01:15:23,690 --> 01:15:25,870
You useless, ungrateful maggot!

1350
01:15:25,940 --> 01:15:27,453
I am the colony!

1351
01:15:27,678 --> 01:15:28,854
Look out!

1352
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:41,040
Z!

1353
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:44,116
Men, let's move it!

1354
01:15:44,517 --> 01:15:46,060
Get these ants up here.

1355
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:52,200
Keep it moving.
Thank goodness we made it.

1356
01:15:57,890 --> 01:15:58,960
Wait here.

1357
01:16:08,570 --> 01:16:10,540
Ok.
Thank you.

1358
01:16:10,570 --> 01:16:11,700
Weaver.

1359
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:14,410
Where is Z?

1360
01:16:22,910 --> 01:16:24,008
Oh, no.

1361
01:16:25,033 --> 01:16:26,825
Back up, everybody, back up!

1362
01:16:27,180 --> 01:16:29,060
Give him some air. Back up.

1363
01:16:29,061 --> 01:16:30,061
Z.
Back up everybody.

1364
01:16:30,362 --> 01:16:31,262
Z.

1365
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:36,860
Please wake up.

1366
01:16:40,370 --> 01:16:40,830
No!

1367
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:00,055
You know Weaver,

1368
01:17:00,456 --> 01:17:02,300
you still owe me that dinner.

1369
01:17:03,380 --> 01:17:04,390
Babylove.

1370
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:07,584
We made it, Z!

1371
01:17:07,809 --> 01:17:08,900
You da ant!

1372
01:17:09,930 --> 01:17:11,680
You did it.

1373
01:17:12,050 --> 01:17:13,060
We did it.

1374
01:17:14,890 --> 01:17:16,570
Fellas! Fellas, please!

1375
01:17:16,740 --> 01:17:18,770
This is very embarrassing for me, I...

1376
01:17:18,850 --> 01:17:20,429
On.. On the other hand I...

1377
01:17:20,730 --> 01:17:23,370
probably could, could get used to this.

1378
01:17:26,570 --> 01:17:28,910
<i>There you have it.
Your average boy meets girl,</i>

1379
01:17:28,950 --> 01:17:33,190
<i>boy likes girl, boy changes
underlying social order story.</i>

1380
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:35,690
<i>So, what else can I tell you?</i>

1381
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:38,840
<i>We rebuilt the colony.
It's even better than before.</i>

1382
01:17:39,020 --> 01:17:42,420
<i>You know, because now it has
a very large indoor swimming pool.</i>

1383
01:17:42,750 --> 01:17:46,110
<i>Bala and I, incidentally,
are thinking of starting a family,</i>

1384
01:17:46,380 --> 01:17:48,309
<i>you know, just a few kids...</i>

1385
01:17:48,310 --> 01:17:50,590
<i>Maybe a million or two to begin with.</i>

1386
01:17:50,930 --> 01:17:53,540
<i>And I'm wor..
I'm working with a new therapist,</i>

1387
01:17:53,541 --> 01:17:55,798
<i>you know, terrific,
absolutely terrific he is.</i>

1388
01:17:56,199 --> 01:17:58,340
<i>He is been putting me in touch
with my inner maggot,</i>

1389
01:17:58,780 --> 01:18:00,350
<i>which is helping me a great deal.</i>

1390
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:03,940
<i>And you know I finally feel
like I've found my place.</i>

1391
01:18:04,070 --> 01:18:06,130
<i>And you know what?
It's right back where I started.</i>

1392
01:18:06,610 --> 01:18:07,987
<i>But the difference is,</i>

1393
01:18:07,988 --> 01:18:10,080
<i>this time I chose it.</i>
