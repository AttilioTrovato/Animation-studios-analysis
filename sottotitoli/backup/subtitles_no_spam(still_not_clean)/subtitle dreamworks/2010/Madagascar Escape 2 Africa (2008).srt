00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:21,957
Thanks to palashshanu for the Subs.

2
00:00:24,957 --> 00:00:29,724
Well done, boys.Looks like ice-cold sushi for breakfast.

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,074

4
00:00:48,914 --> 00:00:51,707
No, no, son.
Over here.

5
00:00:52,584 --> 00:00:55,314
See the lion?
Look at the lion and get the lion.

6
00:01:00,092 --> 00:01:01,821
Now, son, if you're gonna grow up

7
00:01:01,893 --> 00:01:05,260
and be like your daddy someday,
you gotta learn how to fight.

8
00:01:05,597 --> 00:01:06,928
Da-da.

9
00:01:08,267 --> 00:01:12,207
Now, Alakay, let me show
you something, OK?

10
00:01:12,437 --> 00:01:14,098
You see this mark?

11
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,601
You and me are the same.

12
00:01:16,942 --> 00:01:20,173
When you're bigger,
you'll be Alpha Lion, just like me.

13
00:01:20,312 --> 00:01:23,008
Now let me see you fight. Ready?

14
00:01:23,448 --> 00:01:25,780
No, Alakay. No dancing!

15
00:01:26,285 --> 00:01:28,719
You just amuse yourself, don't you?

16
00:01:28,787 --> 00:01:33,554
You're a strange kid.
You're a strange one. I'm...

17
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:35,889
Now, come on, let's try it again.

18
00:01:35,961 --> 00:01:37,861
No, Alakay.

19
00:01:37,929 --> 00:01:40,397
Stop that right now. Doggone it!

20
00:01:40,465 --> 00:01:43,901
It's so disappointing when they
don't grow up the way you want.

21
00:01:43,969 --> 00:01:47,370
Makunga. You're not
challenging me again, are you?

22
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,842
Look on the bright side. After I defeat
you and become alpha lion,

23
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:55,038
you'll have more time
to spend with your pathetic son.

24
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:00,414
Before I kick your butt, let me ask you:

25
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:03,079
Why do you want
to become the alpha lion?

26
00:02:03,121 --> 00:02:06,420
I'm better looking, I have better hair,
I'm deceivingly smart...

27
00:02:06,491 --> 00:02:08,823
...and I want everyone else
to do what I say.

28
00:02:10,329 --> 00:02:13,162
We fight on three. One...

29
00:02:13,498 --> 00:02:17,332
Pay attention, Alakay.
Daddy will show you how it's done.

30
00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:19,000
Two, three!

31
00:02:41,626 --> 00:02:43,958
- Who's the alpha lion?
- You are.

32
00:02:44,363 --> 00:02:46,024
Don't you forget it.

33
00:02:46,298 --> 00:02:49,199
And that, Alakay, is how you attack...

34
00:02:50,535 --> 00:02:51,661
Alakay?

35
00:02:56,541 --> 00:03:00,534
That's it. Here, kitty, kitty.

36
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,441
This one's a beauty.

37
00:03:04,216 --> 00:03:05,774
He'll be worth a few bucks.

38
00:03:06,885 --> 00:03:09,046
It just gets easier and easier.

39
00:03:11,056 --> 00:03:12,318
Daddy!

40
00:03:12,391 --> 00:03:14,382
Alakay! Alakay!

41
00:03:14,893 --> 00:03:16,793
Alakay!

42
00:03:19,331 --> 00:03:21,390
Da-da!

43
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,891
No! No! No!

44
00:03:27,005 --> 00:03:28,063
Alakay!

45
00:03:38,784 --> 00:03:41,810
- Daddy!
- Daddy's got you! Hold on!

46
00:03:46,258 --> 00:03:48,249
Da-da!

47
00:04:02,941 --> 00:04:04,932
Alakay!

48
00:04:11,116 --> 00:04:13,448
Daddy!

49
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:37,366
I've been around the world
in the pouring rain

50
00:04:37,442 --> 00:04:40,809
Feeling out of place
and feeling strange

51
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:43,871
Take me to a place
where they know my name

52
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:47,248
'Cause I ain't met nobody
that looks the same

53
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:50,413
I'm a fish out of water
Lion out of the jungle

54
00:04:50,489 --> 00:04:54,118
He's a fish out of water
Lion out of the jungle

55
00:04:54,192 --> 00:04:57,320
I'm a fish out of water
Lion out of the jungle

56
00:04:57,395 --> 00:05:00,489
He's a fish out of water
Lion out of the jungle

57
00:05:00,599 --> 00:05:03,932
I need my peoples, my peoples
Take me to my peoples

58
00:05:03,969 --> 00:05:07,735
Play that jungle fever
Show 'em some love

59
00:05:07,806 --> 00:05:09,831
Show love

60
00:05:09,908 --> 00:05:12,342
Just gotta have someone
Gotta have someone

61
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:15,004
To relate to, to relate to

62
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,843
I'm feeling right at home

63
00:05:16,915 --> 00:05:20,180
Feeling right at home
Feeling right at home

64
00:05:20,252 --> 00:05:23,688
Feeling right at home
I'm feeling right at home

65
00:05:23,755 --> 00:05:27,122
See I been traveling
Been traveling forever...

66
00:05:27,192 --> 00:05:30,525
- I don't like the looks of this guy.
- He's kind of cute.

67
00:05:30,595 --> 00:05:32,790
He's kind of a showoff.

68
00:05:32,864 --> 00:05:35,196
You think he's cute?

69
00:05:47,712 --> 00:05:49,543
Roar!!

70
00:05:50,549 --> 00:05:53,211
The King of New York City...

71
00:05:53,552 --> 00:05:56,385
...Alex the Lion!

72
00:05:56,955 --> 00:05:59,617
I still think he's kind of a showoff.

73
00:05:59,891 --> 00:06:01,756
The guy's an animal.

74
00:06:01,826 --> 00:06:05,819
Maybe he should take a break.
You know, we could all use a vacation.

75
00:06:05,897 --> 00:06:07,888
Come on, where would we go on vacation?

76
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:11,499
I don't know about you,
but I want to go to Connecticut!

77
00:06:11,736 --> 00:06:15,763
On the loose, several animals, including
the world famous Alex the Lion,

78
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,934
escaped from
the Central Park Zoo tonight.

79
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:22,241
The escapees were cornered
in Grand Central Station.

80
00:06:22,581 --> 00:06:25,414
He was a very bad kitty.

81
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,446
Animal rights activists,
who convinced zoo officials

82
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,784
to have the animals sent to Africa,

83
00:06:30,855 --> 00:06:34,188
were stunned to learn
that the freighter carrying the animals

84
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:35,851
was reported missing today.

85
00:06:36,428 --> 00:06:40,023
Tonight, hundreds of New Yorkers
have gathered at the zoo

86
00:06:40,098 --> 00:06:42,692
to mourn the loss
of their beloved zoo animals.

87
00:06:42,767 --> 00:06:46,726
The question on everyone's mind,
where are they now?

88
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:29,310
I like to move it, move it

89
00:07:29,381 --> 00:07:31,246
He likes to move it, move it

90
00:07:31,316 --> 00:07:33,250
She likes to move it, move it

91
00:07:33,318 --> 00:07:36,014
- We like to
- Move it!

92
00:07:36,087 --> 00:07:40,581
Come on! Y'all know this one!
It never gets stale!

93
00:07:40,725 --> 00:07:42,317
- We like to
- Move it!

94
00:07:42,394 --> 00:07:45,852
We'll miss you little fuzz buckets!
You've been a great crowd!

95
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:48,330
Glad we could introduce
you to the toilet.

96
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,494
If you ever come look us up in
Manhattan, feel free to call first.

97
00:07:54,005 --> 00:07:56,166
Seriously though, call. OK?

98
00:07:56,508 --> 00:07:59,272
Settle down, everybody. Be quiet!

99
00:07:59,377 --> 00:08:01,368
You can't leave without this!

100
00:08:01,613 --> 00:08:03,740
Surprise, freaks!

101
00:08:04,516 --> 00:08:06,507
Shake it! Shake it.

102
00:08:07,285 --> 00:08:10,413
Look, I'm a lady! I'm a lady, everyone!

103
00:08:10,689 --> 00:08:14,853
I'm a lady! Not really!
It's me, King Julien!

104
00:08:15,193 --> 00:08:19,095
Which of you is attracted to me?
Hands up!

105
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:27,194
Hey, freaks! You will be very glad
to hear that I am coming with you.

106
00:08:28,373 --> 00:08:29,863
Oh, no, thank you.

107
00:08:30,775 --> 00:08:33,209
Yes, thank you. It's my plane!

108
00:08:33,545 --> 00:08:38,209
Until I return with the spoils
from the new country...

109
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:41,383
...Stevie will be in charge!

110
00:08:45,557 --> 00:08:48,219
I don't think they like that idea.

111
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,551
What are you saying, Stevie?

112
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,488
No.

113
00:08:53,565 --> 00:08:58,002
Could we? No, you didn't say that!
How is that even possible?

114
00:08:58,069 --> 00:09:01,937
Naughty little thing! Stevie says...

115
00:09:02,073 --> 00:09:04,007
Let them eat cake!

116
00:09:04,075 --> 00:09:07,010
King Julien, wait for me!

117
00:09:07,078 --> 00:09:10,343
I'm all packed! I have
a whole itinerary planned!

118
00:09:10,749 --> 00:09:13,411
Oh, no! It's Mort! He's so annoying!

119
00:09:13,685 --> 00:09:15,653
Don't let him on. Stop that thing!

120
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,746
He's carrying scissors and hand cream!

121
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,753
Everybody in! Quickly, get in, get in!
Get in quick!

122
00:09:25,964 --> 00:09:27,295
- Struts.
- Check.

123
00:09:27,465 --> 00:09:28,454
- Flaps.
- Check.

124
00:09:28,633 --> 00:09:30,123
- Engine. Coffee maker.
- Check.

125
00:09:30,602 --> 00:09:32,263
You guys!

126
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,769
Oopsie-daisy!

127
00:09:38,443 --> 00:09:41,776
That has to be the second biggest
slingshot I've ever seen.

128
00:09:42,113 --> 00:09:44,274
But it'll have to do. Attention.

129
00:09:44,516 --> 00:09:45,949
This is your captain speaking.

130
00:09:46,184 --> 00:09:49,176
In the event of an emergency,
place the vest over your head

131
00:09:49,454 --> 00:09:51,115
then kiss your... good-bye.

132
00:09:51,523 --> 00:09:53,388
New York City, here we come!

133
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:56,188
Pray to your personal God
this hunk of junk flies.

134
00:09:56,461 --> 00:09:58,395
Personal God, hunk? What?

135
00:09:59,297 --> 00:10:00,787
We are go, sir.

136
00:10:01,065 --> 00:10:03,966
Open the door! I'm outside!

137
00:10:04,302 --> 00:10:05,963
If cabin pressure is lost,

138
00:10:06,204 --> 00:10:09,731
place the mask over your face
to hide your terrified expression.

139
00:10:09,974 --> 00:10:13,967
Miss, aren't these supposed
to be attached to my seat?

140
00:10:14,179 --> 00:10:16,477
- No, sir.
- OK, boys, launch!

141
00:10:17,816 --> 00:10:19,113
Launch!

142
00:10:19,184 --> 00:10:20,310
- Launch!
- Launch!

143
00:11:01,526 --> 00:11:02,686
Gremlin!

144
00:11:06,197 --> 00:11:07,528
Hey, Mort.

145
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,792
Hi!

146
00:11:13,938 --> 00:11:14,927
That was weird.

147
00:11:15,139 --> 00:11:18,267
- Somebody's dreaming.
- I think I saw Mort on the plane wing.

148
00:11:18,543 --> 00:11:20,374
You got Madagascar on the brain.

149
00:11:20,612 --> 00:11:21,977
I know I'm gonna miss it.

150
00:11:22,046 --> 00:11:26,415
It was incredible. I think it'll seem
more fun the further we are from it.

151
00:11:26,484 --> 00:11:28,145
Like when you bit me on the butt?

152
00:11:28,219 --> 00:11:32,656
I'm gonna take that thing you're
holding onto and use it onstage.

153
00:11:32,724 --> 00:11:36,490
It's all part of my little actor's salad
bar of emotional tidbits.

154
00:11:36,728 --> 00:11:39,390
Are the butts next to the croutons?

155
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:42,662
You don't need to be sarcastic.

156
00:11:42,734 --> 00:11:47,171
When we get back, I might sign up
for the breeding program.

157
00:11:47,238 --> 00:11:48,296
Breeding program?

158
00:11:48,373 --> 00:11:51,501
We reach a point when we
want to meet somebody.

159
00:11:51,576 --> 00:11:54,010
Settle down, have a relationship.

160
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:55,204
I can see that.

161
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,545
What? Like dating?

162
00:11:58,616 --> 00:12:00,174
Yeah, dating.

163
00:12:00,285 --> 00:12:02,776
Other... other guys?

164
00:12:03,421 --> 00:12:06,083
What do you mean, other guys?

165
00:12:09,594 --> 00:12:10,925
Darn it!

166
00:12:11,596 --> 00:12:15,088
What is holding up
that beverage service?!

167
00:12:15,433 --> 00:12:17,264
I'm gonna go check.

168
00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:20,795
You all keep talking.
I'm gonna catch a few winks.

169
00:12:20,872 --> 00:12:22,772
It's so funny!

170
00:12:23,942 --> 00:12:27,810
I like laughing!
It's such a nice experience!

171
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:29,107
To laugh!

172
00:12:33,451 --> 00:12:35,942
Do you mind going back?
This is first class.

173
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:40,821
It's nothing personal. We're just better
than you. Maurice, I'm open! Hit me!

174
00:12:40,892 --> 00:12:43,258
- He shoots, he scores!
- Is that Vivaldi?

175
00:12:43,328 --> 00:12:46,058
- In-flight slave.
- Can I help you, Mr. Mankiewicz?

176
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:48,826
Bring my nuts on a silver platter.

177
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,027
We were checking on our drink order.

178
00:12:51,302 --> 00:12:53,293
Sorry. Been a little backed up.

179
00:12:53,638 --> 00:12:55,936
- I guess I'll go back...
- Where's your body?

180
00:12:56,074 --> 00:13:00,511
You're freaking me out!
Can you please go over there, please?

181
00:13:00,611 --> 00:13:03,774
What happened to
the separation of the classes?

182
00:13:03,815 --> 00:13:06,648
I'm sure this democracy thing
is just a fad.

183
00:13:07,819 --> 00:13:11,152
We'll go out for pineapple,
my bobbly-headed boobily-boo.

184
00:13:11,389 --> 00:13:12,720
Skipper, look.

185
00:13:13,324 --> 00:13:14,518
Analysis.

186
00:13:14,592 --> 00:13:18,756
Looks like a small bulb used to indicate
something unusual, like a malfunction.

187
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:21,025
I find it pretty and somewhat hypnotic.

188
00:13:21,099 --> 00:13:22,088
That too, sir.

189
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:23,497
Right! Rico?

190
00:13:23,735 --> 00:13:24,724
Manual!

191
00:13:27,005 --> 00:13:28,597
Problemo solved.

192
00:13:28,673 --> 00:13:31,005
- We may be out of fuel.
- Why do you think so?

193
00:13:31,275 --> 00:13:32,742
We've lost engine one...

194
00:13:34,345 --> 00:13:36,506
...and engine two is no longer on fire.

195
00:13:36,748 --> 00:13:38,340
Buckle up, boys.

196
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,943
Don't look, doll. This might get hairy.

197
00:13:41,185 --> 00:13:43,517
Attention! This is your captain.

198
00:13:43,755 --> 00:13:47,282
I have good and bad news. The good
news is, we're landing immediately.

199
00:13:47,525 --> 00:13:50,517
The bad news is, we're crash-landing.

200
00:13:52,697 --> 00:13:56,463
When it comes to air travel,
we know you have no choice.

201
00:13:56,534 --> 00:13:58,525
But thanks for choosing Air Penguin.

202
00:14:10,048 --> 00:14:14,382
Raise your arms, Maurice!
It's more fun when you raise your arms!

203
00:14:17,722 --> 00:14:19,053
I can fly!

204
00:14:19,323 --> 00:14:23,987
This could be it, Marty! I want you to
know you are a one-in-a-million friend!

205
00:14:24,062 --> 00:14:27,122
Thanks, buddy! You're the best ever!

206
00:14:27,398 --> 00:14:30,765
- And you won't mind when I tell you...
- Tell me anything!

207
00:14:30,835 --> 00:14:32,632
I broke your iPod!

208
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:35,399
The buttons were so small!
It made me mad!

209
00:14:35,473 --> 00:14:37,737
- The horror!
- I'm sorry!

210
00:14:38,009 --> 00:14:39,670
- I'll kill you, butt-biter!
- It was an accident!

211
00:14:39,911 --> 00:14:41,469
- An accident!
- Butt-biter!

212
00:14:41,746 --> 00:14:44,579
I love you, Gloria! I always have!

213
00:14:51,756 --> 00:14:56,750
Like you love the beach.
Or a good book. Or the beach.

214
00:15:07,939 --> 00:15:10,430
Goodness, doll,
you're shaking like a leaf.

215
00:15:10,775 --> 00:15:12,436
Rico, you've had your fun.

216
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:13,768
Pull up.

217
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,369
Gear down.

218
00:15:19,183 --> 00:15:21,515
Gently. You just want
to kiss the ground.

219
00:15:21,786 --> 00:15:24,448
Just a peck, a smooch,
like you'd kiss your sister.

220
00:15:26,591 --> 00:15:27,580
I said, kiss it!

221
00:15:32,797 --> 00:15:35,732
Now just a little brake. Just a touch.

222
00:15:36,067 --> 00:15:38,467
I believe that's checkmate.

223
00:15:45,643 --> 00:15:49,135
Commence emergency landing procedure.
Flaps up! Deploy!

224
00:16:05,363 --> 00:16:07,194
Oh, we're here.

225
00:16:07,865 --> 00:16:10,026
What in the world?

226
00:16:11,369 --> 00:16:14,805
What happened to the plane?
What did y'all do to the plane?

227
00:16:14,872 --> 00:16:17,306
I'm OK. I'm alive.

228
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:21,402
I can't even sleep for a minute.
This is not JFK.

229
00:16:21,479 --> 00:16:23,504
Kowalski, casualty report.

230
00:16:23,648 --> 00:16:25,548
Two passengers unaccounted for.

231
00:16:25,816 --> 00:16:28,546
That's a number I can live with.
Good landing, boys.

232
00:16:28,819 --> 00:16:31,219
Who says a penguin can't fly?

233
00:16:31,622 --> 00:16:36,286
Hey, happy slappers! Is there some
reason to celebrate? Look at the plane!

234
00:16:36,561 --> 00:16:38,995
- We'll fix it.
- How are you gonna fix this?

235
00:16:39,063 --> 00:16:41,896
Grit, spit and a whole lot of duct tape.

236
00:16:42,233 --> 00:16:45,930
We should be up and running
in, say, six to nine months.

237
00:16:46,003 --> 00:16:48,938
- Sixty-nine months?!
- No, six to nine months.

238
00:16:49,006 --> 00:16:51,736
Kowalski, I say we use
this setback to our advantage.

239
00:16:51,976 --> 00:16:56,072
- Where'd you get that number?
- I want you to reconfigure the design.

240
00:16:56,314 --> 00:16:57,838
How do you estimate that?

241
00:16:58,082 --> 00:17:01,483
Pretty boy! Why don't
you and your friends dig a latrine.

242
00:17:01,586 --> 00:17:04,714
Hold on. Who made you king
of the plane wreck?

243
00:17:04,755 --> 00:17:09,192
Excuse me? Fine. You can be in charge.
You fix the plane.

244
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,626
Who gives you the authority
to put me in charge?

245
00:17:11,696 --> 00:17:13,755
OK, then I'll remain in charge.

246
00:17:13,998 --> 00:17:15,693
Yeah, you will remain in charge.

247
00:17:15,766 --> 00:17:18,428
You and your hippie friends
stay out of our hair.

248
00:17:18,502 --> 00:17:21,335
Correcto-mundo. Because I decided to.

249
00:17:21,405 --> 00:17:25,273
- Good for you.
- Well, this discussion isn't over.

250
00:17:25,776 --> 00:17:27,676
Higher mammals! Stay with us.

251
00:17:27,745 --> 00:17:30,771
We could use your front cortexes
and opposable thumbs.

252
00:17:31,115 --> 00:17:34,778
Phil! I should wash
your hands out with soap.

253
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:38,555
How in the hell-o
will they fix this plane?!

254
00:17:38,623 --> 00:17:41,615
You know, grit and spit and spit.

255
00:17:41,692 --> 00:17:44,559
A lot of spit and grit and
stick-to-it-iveness.

256
00:17:44,629 --> 00:17:46,893
That don't sound too promising.

257
00:17:46,964 --> 00:17:49,489
You're right. We're stuck here.

258
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:53,560
As long as we're together, we'll be OK.

259
00:17:53,638 --> 00:17:56,903
Yeah, but love ain't gonna get us home.

260
00:17:56,974 --> 00:17:59,306
Behold! The lion!

261
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:02,004
- People!
- There is much to see. Moving on.

262
00:18:02,046 --> 00:18:04,480
Wait, wait, wait! People!

263
00:18:06,484 --> 00:18:08,315
- They'll help us!
- Wait up!

264
00:18:08,653 --> 00:18:11,144
- People! Stop!
- Help us!

265
00:18:12,156 --> 00:18:14,818
If you stop, I'll autograph those!

266
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:17,423
I know you!

267
00:18:17,495 --> 00:18:18,553
You.

268
00:18:18,629 --> 00:18:20,654
It's the bad kitty.

269
00:18:29,073 --> 00:18:30,665
How do you like some of that?!

270
00:18:50,194 --> 00:18:51,855
Come in, Tokyo!

271
00:18:58,703 --> 00:19:00,034
Right in the batteries.

272
00:19:00,304 --> 00:19:02,966
You think an old lady
can't take care of herself?

273
00:19:03,374 --> 00:19:06,309
Next time, I won't go so easy on you!

274
00:19:07,111 --> 00:19:08,772
Thank you, dear.

275
00:19:09,046 --> 00:19:10,377
Moving on!

276
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:16,884
Are you out of your mind?
We need help and you harass old ladies?!

277
00:19:17,121 --> 00:19:19,112
Out of my mind?

278
00:19:19,557 --> 00:19:22,048
Who's out of my mind now?

279
00:19:22,126 --> 00:19:24,492
- See if you can get an operator.
- No problem.

280
00:19:24,562 --> 00:19:27,895
Out of my mind. We're going home.

281
00:19:38,909 --> 00:19:40,570
Message E-4.

282
00:19:40,811 --> 00:19:44,474
The service user has roamed
outside the coverage area.

283
00:19:44,749 --> 00:19:47,081
Please try again later.

284
00:19:51,756 --> 00:19:53,087
Am I trippin'?

285
00:19:53,758 --> 00:19:56,591
All those zebras... like me.

286
00:19:57,595 --> 00:20:00,257
- Where are we?
- San Diego.

287
00:20:00,598 --> 00:20:02,930
This time I'm 40 percent sure.

288
00:20:03,267 --> 00:20:05,599
- I know this place.
- I think it's Africa.

289
00:20:05,836 --> 00:20:06,825
Africa?

290
00:20:07,104 --> 00:20:08,435
It's got to be.

291
00:20:08,773 --> 00:20:11,264
Our ancestral crib.

292
00:20:11,509 --> 00:20:13,704
It's in our blood. I can feel it!

293
00:20:13,944 --> 00:20:16,435
No, it's more than that. It's like...

294
00:20:16,781 --> 00:20:19,614
...déjà vu, like I've been here before.

295
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:21,442
It's like Roots!

296
00:20:21,719 --> 00:20:23,186
No, it's like...

297
00:20:23,454 --> 00:20:26,617
...déjà vu, like I've been here before.

298
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:28,956
How!

299
00:20:31,796 --> 00:20:33,127
How!

300
00:20:36,967 --> 00:20:38,628
Me Alex!

301
00:20:38,969 --> 00:20:42,132
Me and me friends fly,

302
00:20:42,473 --> 00:20:45,465
fly in great metal bird.

303
00:20:46,977 --> 00:20:49,138
Then plummet!

304
00:20:50,147 --> 00:20:51,478
Smash ground!

305
00:20:52,216 --> 00:20:53,979
Go boom!

306
00:20:54,819 --> 00:20:58,311
Then here we emerge.

307
00:20:58,656 --> 00:21:01,682
We offer only happiness

308
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:03,420
and good greetings.

309
00:21:04,161 --> 00:21:06,823
Is he dancing about a plane crash?

310
00:21:07,498 --> 00:21:09,329
Yeah. We just... yeah.

311
00:21:09,667 --> 00:21:11,328
I thought... Sorry.

312
00:21:11,402 --> 00:21:13,563
You came from off the reserve?

313
00:21:13,838 --> 00:21:16,671
Way off. From the Central Park Zoo,
actually.

314
00:21:24,515 --> 00:21:26,005
Don't strain yourself.

315
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,445
What's going on here?

316
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:31,283
They say they're from off the reserve.

317
00:21:31,355 --> 00:21:34,722
That's impossible. Only people
come from off the reserve.

318
00:21:34,792 --> 00:21:36,953
You look familiar. Do I know you?

319
00:21:37,027 --> 00:21:39,552
How could you survive the hunters?

320
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:41,962
We didn't see any hunters.

321
00:21:42,032 --> 00:21:43,897
- What are you looking at?
- Me? Nothing.

322
00:21:43,968 --> 00:21:47,131
This watering hole doesn't need
any more mouths to feed.

323
00:21:47,371 --> 00:21:49,703
So skedaddle back
to where you came from.

324
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:52,135
Is there a manager we could talk to?

325
00:21:52,376 --> 00:21:55,277
I see. You're here to challenge me!

326
00:21:55,546 --> 00:21:57,036
What? No! No.

327
00:21:57,281 --> 00:21:58,942
That's what it looks like to me!

328
00:21:59,216 --> 00:22:00,547
Zuba! Wait.

329
00:22:00,818 --> 00:22:02,547
I'm trying to take care of business...

330
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:05,282
Yeah, yeah, Zuba. Hold on.

331
00:22:05,956 --> 00:22:07,287
Alakay?

332
00:22:08,058 --> 00:22:09,389
Is that you?

333
00:22:09,627 --> 00:22:12,960
No, it's Alex. lx. Like New York Knicks.

334
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:15,323
Zuba, look!

335
00:22:15,399 --> 00:22:18,391
I've always had that.
The vet checked it out.

336
00:22:18,736 --> 00:22:20,727
It's kind of a beauty spot, really.

337
00:22:20,804 --> 00:22:22,499
A mark.

338
00:22:23,407 --> 00:22:26,069
All right, this is a little weird.

339
00:22:26,644 --> 00:22:29,238
Honey, he's come home.

340
00:22:29,647 --> 00:22:31,274
What?

341
00:22:31,415 --> 00:22:33,246
You've come home.

342
00:22:41,592 --> 00:22:42,650
Son.

343
00:22:48,933 --> 00:22:49,922
Dad.

344
00:22:52,102 --> 00:22:55,037
Mom and Dad? Mom and Dad!

345
00:22:55,105 --> 00:22:58,438
Mom and Dad! It's my mom and dad!

346
00:22:59,343 --> 00:23:01,004
I got a mom and dad!

347
00:23:01,278 --> 00:23:02,609
My baby's alive!

348
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,211
Dad!

349
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:06,109
My son!

350
00:23:06,784 --> 00:23:09,446
My son is home!

351
00:23:11,355 --> 00:23:14,449
Alakay! Alakay has come home!

352
00:23:18,295 --> 00:23:22,959
Alakay! Yeah! The prodigal son returns.
This is perfect!

353
00:23:23,367 --> 00:23:25,460
I thought you hated Zuba.

354
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:30,236
No, I do. I do. I do.
I hate him. Oh, I do.

355
00:23:30,307 --> 00:23:32,832
And I'm going to use Alakay, yes.

356
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:36,471
I'm going to use him
to get rid of Zuba once and for all!

357
00:23:36,714 --> 00:23:38,306
Giddy-up, feathered horse!

358
00:23:38,382 --> 00:23:41,249
Make way!
Move out of the way! Stand aside!

359
00:23:41,318 --> 00:23:42,979
New York!

360
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:47,256
It's a bit of a dump.
Are you sure we're not in New Jersey?

361
00:23:47,324 --> 00:23:50,589
Hello, New Yorkers!
Your new king is here!

362
00:23:50,661 --> 00:23:52,925
This calls for a celebration!

363
00:23:52,997 --> 00:23:54,862
Maurice, I think they like me.

364
00:23:54,932 --> 00:23:57,492
You've got to love
a non-hostile takeover!

365
00:23:59,336 --> 00:24:00,826
Chukka-chukka what?

366
00:24:07,277 --> 00:24:11,407
Excuse me. I'm Marty.
I'm kind of new around here.

367
00:24:12,282 --> 00:24:13,943
Hey, Marty!

368
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:20,420
You're a good-looking group!
You like to run?

369
00:24:20,758 --> 00:24:23,192
Yeah. Running is crack-a-lackin'.

370
00:24:23,527 --> 00:24:25,961
That's right! Crack-a-lackin'.

371
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:29,056
You guys speak
my crack-a-lackin' language.

372
00:24:29,133 --> 00:24:31,567
What? You don't have doctors here?

373
00:24:31,635 --> 00:24:33,125
Not anymore.

374
00:24:33,203 --> 00:24:35,694
Well, what if you catch a cold?

375
00:24:35,773 --> 00:24:38,867
We go over to the dying holes
and we die.

376
00:24:41,311 --> 00:24:43,609
You guys really need a doctor.

377
00:24:43,681 --> 00:24:46,878
- We have an opening.
- Would you be interested?

378
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:49,441
Me? A doctor?

379
00:24:53,991 --> 00:24:57,722
It's raining men. Hallelujah!
You all got it going on.

380
00:24:57,795 --> 00:25:00,821
Why don't you have a man? You got worms?

381
00:25:00,931 --> 00:25:03,422
Oh, I got rid of those. Listen, girls.

382
00:25:03,467 --> 00:25:06,595
Manhattan is short on two things,
parking and hippos.

383
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:09,798
Hey, everybody!
I just found out that my son

384
00:25:09,873 --> 00:25:13,809
is a doggone king!
The King of New York!

385
00:25:15,813 --> 00:25:18,611
Show me some of your moves, son.
Don't be bashful.

386
00:25:18,682 --> 00:25:21,344
All right. This one
always knocks 'em dead.

387
00:25:21,685 --> 00:25:23,277
Roar!

388
00:25:23,353 --> 00:25:27,414
Look out. The King is mad.
The King is mad!

389
00:25:27,491 --> 00:25:32,360
Let's welcome him back
into the pride with open arms!

390
00:25:36,033 --> 00:25:37,864
Welcome to the herd, Marty!

391
00:25:37,935 --> 00:25:41,302
Me? I've always wanted
to be part of a herd!

392
00:25:41,371 --> 00:25:44,704
- It's one for all...
- [all] And all for all, y'all!

393
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:47,841
How do I look?

394
00:25:48,112 --> 00:25:53,106
Technically, a traditional witch doctor
has a bone through his nose.

395
00:25:53,383 --> 00:25:55,783
Don't worry... it's just a clip-on.

396
00:25:56,286 --> 00:25:58,516
Voilà! He's a witch doctor!

397
00:25:58,856 --> 00:26:01,188
My mother will be so happy.

398
00:26:05,062 --> 00:26:09,192
Look out! I think Moto Moto likes you.

399
00:26:11,635 --> 00:26:12,966
Here he comes.

400
00:26:16,206 --> 00:26:17,537
I like 'em big

401
00:26:18,075 --> 00:26:19,975
I like 'em chunky

402
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:24,144
I like 'em big
I like 'em plumpy

403
00:26:24,214 --> 00:26:27,911
I like 'em round
With somethin' somethin'

404
00:26:27,985 --> 00:26:31,216
They like my sound
They think I'm funky

405
00:26:31,288 --> 00:26:33,654
Goodness, girl... you huge.

406
00:26:33,891 --> 00:26:35,984
Who's your friend? Or is that your butt?

407
00:26:37,427 --> 00:26:39,418
You as quick as you are hefty.

408
00:26:39,663 --> 00:26:42,063
So you're Moto Moto?

409
00:26:42,132 --> 00:26:44,327
The name's so nice, you say it twice.

410
00:26:44,568 --> 00:26:46,229
I kind of like it, fatso.

411
00:26:46,303 --> 00:26:50,501
I'll see you around, girl. It won't
be hard, because you so... plumpy.

412
00:26:57,848 --> 00:26:58,906
Oops!

413
00:27:00,918 --> 00:27:03,250
I hate to be a party pooper, Zuba,

414
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,786
but some of the lions were wondering
when you plan to banish your son.

415
00:27:08,025 --> 00:27:11,290
- What are you talking about?
- It's nothing, really.

416
00:27:11,361 --> 00:27:13,989
They're griping that Alakay
never went through

417
00:27:14,064 --> 00:27:16,157
the rite of passage,
blah, blah, blah,

418
00:27:16,233 --> 00:27:21,637
so technically speaking, he can't be
a member of the pride. It's nonsense.

419
00:27:21,705 --> 00:27:24,003
I forgot about the rite of passage.

420
00:27:24,074 --> 00:27:26,338
What is it? What's this rite of passage?

421
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:28,935
A traditional coming-of-age ceremony.

422
00:27:29,213 --> 00:27:32,740
Young lions earn their manes
by demonstrating their skills.

423
00:27:32,816 --> 00:27:36,547
- A show-of-skill talent show deal?
- Yeah. Strutting their stuff.

424
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:39,748
A performance!
I think that's up my alley.

425
00:27:39,823 --> 00:27:43,657
If it's tradition, I want to do it.
Strut my stuff. Earn my mane.

426
00:27:43,727 --> 00:27:45,490
I want to be Alaki.

427
00:27:45,562 --> 00:27:47,894
- Alakay.
- Alakay! Even better.

428
00:27:47,965 --> 00:27:50,559
We will hold the rite
of passage in the morning!

429
00:27:50,634 --> 00:27:53,330
That's wonderful! Good luck, Alakay.

430
00:27:53,403 --> 00:27:55,667
Where I'm from, we say, "Break a leg."

431
00:27:55,739 --> 00:27:57,900
That's my boy!

432
00:28:04,314 --> 00:28:07,112
I'm a private dancer

433
00:28:07,184 --> 00:28:09,652
A dancer for money

434
00:28:17,094 --> 00:28:19,585
Any old music will do

435
00:28:22,432 --> 00:28:24,263
Beautiful, isn't it?

436
00:28:24,334 --> 00:28:26,325
It's amazing.

437
00:28:27,204 --> 00:28:28,535
Guys...

438
00:28:29,273 --> 00:28:31,264
...this is where we belong.

439
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:35,342
Operation Tourist Trap is a go.

440
00:28:35,612 --> 00:28:37,477
Oh, I like that one.

441
00:28:37,547 --> 00:28:39,276
It works on many levels.

442
00:28:39,349 --> 00:28:41,146
You guys are a bunch of suck-ups.

443
00:28:41,218 --> 00:28:42,708
- That, too.
- Absolutely.

444
00:28:42,786 --> 00:28:44,617
Stations.

445
00:28:44,688 --> 00:28:46,679
Stage one. Go!

446
00:29:00,704 --> 00:29:03,229
Oh, no! What have I done?

447
00:29:03,473 --> 00:29:04,804
Come on, take the bait.

448
00:29:04,875 --> 00:29:07,503
- What happened?
- Oh, look at the poor little guy.

449
00:29:07,577 --> 00:29:09,135
Is it dead?

450
00:29:10,314 --> 00:29:12,373
Stage two! Go, go, go!

451
00:29:19,923 --> 00:29:22,585
I will give him the kiss of life.

452
00:29:24,261 --> 00:29:25,250
Rico!

453
00:29:28,565 --> 00:29:30,294
Rico!

454
00:29:32,502 --> 00:29:33,867
Reverse!

455
00:29:33,937 --> 00:29:34,926
Gas!

456
00:29:35,005 --> 00:29:36,267
Music!

457
00:29:37,607 --> 00:29:39,666
No! Stop! Stop!

458
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:42,609
Stop!

459
00:29:42,846 --> 00:29:44,177
Come back!

460
00:29:46,283 --> 00:29:48,945
What is all this rock'n'roll racket?!

461
00:29:54,958 --> 00:29:56,289
Is she dead?

462
00:29:57,094 --> 00:29:58,083
No!

463
00:30:06,203 --> 00:30:08,103
You hoodlums!

464
00:30:10,107 --> 00:30:11,972
Good heavens! Are you OK?

465
00:30:12,042 --> 00:30:15,239
Lady, I found your pocketbook.

466
00:30:15,312 --> 00:30:19,043
My handbag. Such a good boy.

467
00:30:19,116 --> 00:30:21,311
Nana can't survive without it.

468
00:30:21,551 --> 00:30:23,542
You are one tough cookie.

469
00:30:23,787 --> 00:30:26,620
Brownies Troop 416, Yonkers.

470
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:30,490
OK, nobody panic! The best thing
we can do is stay together.

471
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:34,155
We'll wait for another tour jeep.
It may take hours, but...

472
00:30:34,231 --> 00:30:35,323
Where are you going?

473
00:30:36,233 --> 00:30:40,795
I'm not staying here to be attacked
by more animals! I'm too old to die.

474
00:30:42,139 --> 00:30:45,666
I'm going with her. Old lady, wait up!

475
00:30:46,076 --> 00:30:48,476
Please! We need to stay...

476
00:30:49,012 --> 00:30:50,343
...together.

477
00:30:51,481 --> 00:30:53,472
Fine! We'll go that way!

478
00:30:53,817 --> 00:30:56,149
Does anyone want a hard candy?

479
00:31:00,157 --> 00:31:02,352
- Easy now.
- Watch your step.

480
00:31:03,026 --> 00:31:06,826
And right here... OK, are you ready?

481
00:31:08,832 --> 00:31:11,096
This is where you always slept.

482
00:31:11,168 --> 00:31:12,829
Oh, man!

483
00:31:16,706 --> 00:31:20,164
- Was this mine?
- Look at you. Look at him.

484
00:31:20,944 --> 00:31:23,606
Oh, this thing. Look, look!

485
00:31:24,181 --> 00:31:26,513
- I remember this!
- He remembers.

486
00:31:27,517 --> 00:31:28,506
A little harder than...

487
00:31:28,785 --> 00:31:32,516
You never slept on the right end.
You always slept on the bottom end.

488
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:34,516
Is that?

489
00:31:34,858 --> 00:31:36,189
Is that my?

490
00:31:38,195 --> 00:31:39,526
Is that me?

491
00:31:40,063 --> 00:31:42,293
You had the cutest little paws.

492
00:31:42,532 --> 00:31:44,864
Little, little bitty ol' paws.

493
00:31:45,202 --> 00:31:47,864
You did that the day we lost you.

494
00:31:49,206 --> 00:31:51,868
Wow. I was so young.

495
00:31:52,542 --> 00:31:53,907
What happened to me?

496
00:31:54,878 --> 00:31:58,405
It was all my fault.
I turned my back and...

497
00:31:58,482 --> 00:32:00,473
It was not your fault.

498
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:05,744
Your father did everything he could.
He tracked those hunters for weeks.

499
00:32:06,089 --> 00:32:07,420
Far off the reserve.

500
00:32:07,657 --> 00:32:10,751
Finally, I had to assume the hunters...

501
00:32:11,228 --> 00:32:12,217
...well...

502
00:32:12,562 --> 00:32:15,895
We thought they'd killed you.

503
00:32:16,233 --> 00:32:20,567
But my son fought them off!
Don't mess with the King of New York!

504
00:32:20,837 --> 00:32:22,327
- That's right!
- Keep your chin in.

505
00:32:22,572 --> 00:32:26,770
You boys be careful!
Watch out before you break something.

506
00:32:28,245 --> 00:32:31,043
You used to call this "foofie."

507
00:32:31,114 --> 00:32:32,604
"Foofie"?

508
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:34,849
Foofie.

509
00:32:34,918 --> 00:32:36,442
He doesn't want that.

510
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,112
This is my foofie!

511
00:32:41,091 --> 00:32:43,116
Zuba, you better give him his foofie.

512
00:32:43,193 --> 00:32:47,459
I mean, no, thank you,
thank you. It's perfect.

513
00:32:47,797 --> 00:32:51,130
Son, you get your rest.
You have a big day tomorrow.

514
00:32:51,468 --> 00:32:53,629
You'll need all your strength.

515
00:32:53,703 --> 00:32:56,137
I will bring the house down for you.

516
00:32:56,606 --> 00:33:00,201
I hope so. Otherwise,
your father will have to banish you.

517
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:02,277
Jeez, Mom, really?

518
00:33:02,546 --> 00:33:05,538
I know you'll do us proud. You know why?

519
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:09,482
You were born with it.

520
00:33:10,954 --> 00:33:12,478
Good night, Alakay.

521
00:33:12,822 --> 00:33:15,484
My boy. My own boy.

522
00:33:17,961 --> 00:33:19,826
My son's a king.

523
00:33:20,964 --> 00:33:22,829
My son's a king.

524
00:33:32,976 --> 00:33:34,500
Good night, Mom.

525
00:33:35,512 --> 00:33:37,503
Good night, Alakay.

526
00:33:44,187 --> 00:33:45,654
Foofie.

527
00:33:46,189 --> 00:33:48,521
Look at foofie! My foofie!

528
00:33:50,126 --> 00:33:52,754
Foofie, foofie, foofie. My foofie!

529
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:58,331
No sign of civilization.
Everybody appears very tired.

530
00:33:58,668 --> 00:34:00,659
I think we're lost.

531
00:34:00,937 --> 00:34:03,531
Nana, do you know where you're going?

532
00:34:03,607 --> 00:34:08,271
No, but I'm going with a skip
in my step and a smile on my face.

533
00:34:08,345 --> 00:34:10,677
Sure, right, OK. Yeah, all right.

534
00:34:13,016 --> 00:34:15,883
- It's people.
- How did you get here?

535
00:34:15,952 --> 00:34:18,614
- Can you help us? We're lost.
- We're lost too.

536
00:34:18,688 --> 00:34:23,352
It was awful. A flash of black and white
and they were gone. They took the jeep!

537
00:34:23,426 --> 00:34:26,190
- That happened to our jeep too!
- What do we do?

538
00:34:26,263 --> 00:34:27,628
How will we all survive?

539
00:34:27,697 --> 00:34:31,690
No food, no water, no shelter.
What are we gonna do?!

540
00:34:33,703 --> 00:34:36,638
You can let nature
get the best of you,

541
00:34:36,706 --> 00:34:39,140
or you can get the best of nature.

542
00:34:41,645 --> 00:34:45,445
Gather 'round, children.
We're New Yorkers, right?

543
00:34:45,515 --> 00:34:46,777
Yeah.

544
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:50,308
We survive the concrete jungle!

545
00:34:50,387 --> 00:34:53,823
When we need food, we hunt
for a decent hot dog stand.

546
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:55,551
- Am I right?
- She's right.

547
00:34:55,625 --> 00:34:59,061
When we need shelter,
we build skyscrapers.

548
00:34:59,162 --> 00:35:03,622
- Exactly!
- When we need water, we build a dam.

549
00:35:03,667 --> 00:35:05,862
We're New Yorkers, for crying out loud!

550
00:35:05,935 --> 00:35:08,335
If we can make it there,

551
00:35:08,405 --> 00:35:10,930
we can make it anywhere!

552
00:35:27,123 --> 00:35:29,284
I'm coming, King Julien!

553
00:35:35,799 --> 00:35:38,131
Bad fishy! Bad fishy!

554
00:35:39,803 --> 00:35:42,135
No, shark, no! Sit!

555
00:35:44,474 --> 00:35:46,305
Why am I laughing?

556
00:35:49,879 --> 00:35:54,248
We have all the parts we need,
but we're slightly behind schedule.

557
00:35:54,317 --> 00:35:56,683
- How slightly?
- Six to nine years.

558
00:35:56,753 --> 00:35:59,984
- Sixty-nine years?
- No, six to nine years.

559
00:36:00,423 --> 00:36:02,789
Private! What happened to our thumbs?

560
00:36:02,859 --> 00:36:04,918
Haven't seen them since yesterday.

561
00:36:04,994 --> 00:36:06,825
Darn you, Darwin!

562
00:36:06,896 --> 00:36:11,833
Nobody goes AWOL on my watch.
Private! You're coming with me.

563
00:36:12,502 --> 00:36:14,834
Rico! You're coming with me!

564
00:36:15,505 --> 00:36:19,498
- We'll bring them in for court martial.
- That won't be necessary!

565
00:36:19,576 --> 00:36:23,171
We've recruited
a few extra thumbs for you, Skipper.

566
00:36:29,686 --> 00:36:31,517
Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle.

567
00:36:31,855 --> 00:36:33,686
Oh, I doubt that.

568
00:36:40,196 --> 00:36:42,357
Enough lollygagging. Let's get to work.

569
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:46,467
There'll be three groups. Group Alpha
will do sheet metal fabrication.

570
00:36:46,603 --> 00:36:50,767
Group Bronson handles assembly.
Group George Peppard, craft services.

571
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,205
Any questions?

572
00:36:52,542 --> 00:36:55,033
Good! Let's get to work.

573
00:37:02,385 --> 00:37:05,218
I'd like to kiss you, monkey man.

574
00:37:05,555 --> 00:37:09,047
All right, but you're so darn ugly.

575
00:37:15,231 --> 00:37:19,634
Remember, little cub scouts, a great
dance performance comes from the heart.

576
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:23,061
Straight from the heart,
you'll never go wrong.

577
00:37:24,908 --> 00:37:26,000
Sure, mister.

578
00:37:26,075 --> 00:37:30,102
Hey, Alakay, I just happened to walk by,
I thought I'd wish you luck.

579
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:33,672
- You're not nervous, are you?
- Nah, it's my thing.

580
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:37,516
In my opinion, the key to this
is choosing the right competitor.

581
00:37:37,587 --> 00:37:40,852
You mean, this is like
a dance battle sort of thing?

582
00:37:40,924 --> 00:37:42,983
- Like a dance-off?
- Sure.

583
00:37:43,259 --> 00:37:45,420
Great. I love that. Freestyle.

584
00:37:45,762 --> 00:37:49,596
Who'd be a good match for me?
Just to keep things interesting.

585
00:37:50,433 --> 00:37:52,594
Well, I wish I could help,

586
00:37:52,869 --> 00:37:56,430
but that's strictly against our ancient
tradition and all we hold sacred.

587
00:37:56,673 --> 00:38:00,200
But if it was me out there...
I'd choose Teetsi.

588
00:38:00,944 --> 00:38:04,380
Teetsi. OK. Sounds interesting.

589
00:38:04,447 --> 00:38:05,937
Makunga, right? Thank you.

590
00:38:06,216 --> 00:38:08,684
Anything for Zuba's boy.
Go get 'em, tiger.

591
00:38:08,952 --> 00:38:10,283
Shake it out.

592
00:38:10,954 --> 00:38:12,785
A five, six, seven, eight.

593
00:38:13,122 --> 00:38:15,454
Let's go, let's do this.

594
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:36,301
Let us begin
the rite of passage ceremony.

595
00:38:36,379 --> 00:38:39,712
- Come on, baby! Make Mama proud!
- Woman, I'm trying to take...

596
00:38:39,782 --> 00:38:40,976
On it, Mom!

597
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:42,813
Who will be the first participant?

598
00:38:42,886 --> 00:38:45,480
Me! Oh! Me, me, me!
Me! Me! Me! Me, me! Please, me?

599
00:38:45,822 --> 00:38:48,154
How about you? The tall, handsome one.

600
00:38:48,391 --> 00:38:50,154
Yeah. Choose your opponent.

601
00:38:50,827 --> 00:38:52,488
Let me see.

602
00:38:53,663 --> 00:38:56,154
I guess I'll pick...

603
00:38:59,269 --> 00:39:00,258
...Teetsi?

604
00:39:02,272 --> 00:39:04,740
Teetsi? Why did he pick Teetsi?

605
00:39:05,008 --> 00:39:08,341
That's my boy!
He's got some gumption there!

606
00:39:09,178 --> 00:39:11,009
Somebody, wake him up!

607
00:39:24,627 --> 00:39:27,460
All right, so, Teetsi, come on.
Let's do this, huh?

608
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:32,024
Come on, little tsetse fly.
Let's see your stuff. Bring it.

609
00:39:32,302 --> 00:39:34,270
- Let's dance!
- OK.

610
00:39:34,337 --> 00:39:37,101
But let me warn you
that I am a protégé of...

611
00:39:37,373 --> 00:39:40,035
...Fosse and Robbins!

612
00:39:40,376 --> 00:39:42,867
Not "dance" dance! Fight!

613
00:39:43,713 --> 00:39:46,045
Dance fight! You got it.

614
00:39:52,789 --> 00:39:54,654
- Is he dancing?
- What's he doing?

615
00:39:54,724 --> 00:39:57,056
I know that boy is not dancing.

616
00:39:57,727 --> 00:39:59,888
This is even better than I thought.

617
00:40:02,732 --> 00:40:04,222
Alakay, turn around!

618
00:40:04,467 --> 00:40:08,665
No, Pop, it's hop, shuffle,
ball change, hip swish, turn around.

619
00:40:18,414 --> 00:40:20,075
Oh, no.

620
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:23,411
Alakay! Are you hurt?

621
00:40:23,753 --> 00:40:25,414
Yeah, I am.

622
00:40:25,688 --> 00:40:27,485
Did I... did I win?

623
00:40:27,557 --> 00:40:28,888
No, son.

624
00:40:28,958 --> 00:40:31,017
How could this happen?

625
00:40:31,094 --> 00:40:35,155
You told us you were a king.
A king does not get beat.

626
00:40:35,231 --> 00:40:39,258
I am a king. I'm the King of New York.

627
00:40:39,769 --> 00:40:43,728
It's my stage name.
Like for when I perform.

628
00:40:43,806 --> 00:40:44,966
Perform?

629
00:40:45,041 --> 00:40:49,375
Oh, no, this is horrible!
Alakay has failed the test!

630
00:40:49,946 --> 00:40:54,610
Who would have ever imagined
that today Zuba would have to banish...

631
00:40:55,284 --> 00:40:56,876
...his own son?

632
00:40:56,953 --> 00:40:59,012
Zuba, no.

633
00:40:59,122 --> 00:41:00,987
Zuba, yes.

634
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:05,124
Sadly, the alpha lion
must cast out all failures.

635
00:41:17,807 --> 00:41:20,207
Then I'm no longer the alpha lion.

636
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:22,971
Dad, what are you doing?

637
00:41:23,312 --> 00:41:26,145
Dad, no! You can't do this.

638
00:41:28,418 --> 00:41:30,886
Who could possibly take Zuba's place?

639
00:41:31,988 --> 00:41:33,148
Anyone?

640
00:41:33,489 --> 00:41:35,320
Someone? No one?

641
00:41:36,225 --> 00:41:37,749
You, sir!

642
00:41:37,827 --> 00:41:39,419
I guess not.

643
00:41:39,495 --> 00:41:42,487
Well, I... this is all very awkward,

644
00:41:42,832 --> 00:41:46,324
but I suppose I could carry
this tremendous burden.

645
00:41:48,004 --> 00:41:50,336
Teetsi! Get the hat.

646
00:41:52,008 --> 00:41:55,842
As your new leader,
I hereby banish Alakay!

647
00:41:56,179 --> 00:41:58,170
He shall wear this Hat of Shame...

648
00:41:58,448 --> 00:42:01,178
...and leave the watering hole

649
00:42:01,517 --> 00:42:04,008
for a thousand years, or life!

650
00:42:05,354 --> 00:42:07,015
Whichever comes last.

651
00:42:09,926 --> 00:42:12,861
Shoo, shoo! Get out of here!

652
00:42:13,196 --> 00:42:17,360
You should have told us
you weren't a real king, son!

653
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,000
You never told me
I'd have to fight anybody!

654
00:42:20,069 --> 00:42:21,366
What did you expect?!

655
00:42:21,437 --> 00:42:25,999
I don't know! Maybe a little fatherly
advice like, "Hey, son, it's a fight!"

656
00:42:26,075 --> 00:42:28,873
- You're a lion!
- But I never fought another lion!

657
00:42:28,945 --> 00:42:30,845
No, I guess not. You dance!

658
00:42:30,913 --> 00:42:34,974
And other stuff! Your pal, Makunga,
set me up back there!

659
00:42:35,051 --> 00:42:37,815
- None of this would have happened...
- If you were a real lion.

660
00:42:37,887 --> 00:42:39,616
- Zuba!
- Yeah, I said it!

661
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:43,051
A real lion.

662
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:45,391
Thanks.

663
00:42:48,731 --> 00:42:50,221
Thanks a lot.

664
00:43:00,176 --> 00:43:01,404
Saw.

665
00:43:02,745 --> 00:43:04,076
Suture.

666
00:43:05,915 --> 00:43:07,246
Swab.

667
00:43:07,517 --> 00:43:08,848
You're in my light, Stephen.

668
00:43:09,085 --> 00:43:11,747
You have a brown spot on your shoulder.

669
00:43:11,988 --> 00:43:16,516
That's very observant, Stephen. As you
can see, I'm covered in brown spots.

670
00:43:16,759 --> 00:43:20,251
OK! That bone will be good
as new in a few weeks.

671
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:22,657
So I don't have
to pick out a dying hole?

672
00:43:22,865 --> 00:43:25,197
No, you got
your whole life ahead of you.

673
00:43:25,268 --> 00:43:27,702
- Really?
- Go out and grab it by the horns.

674
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:31,433
- Thank you, Dr. Mankiewicz!
- Break a leg! Sweet kid.

675
00:43:31,674 --> 00:43:34,541
This spot looks
like Witch Doctor's Disease.

676
00:43:35,111 --> 00:43:39,946
Witch Doctor's Disease? That's the most
ridiculous disease I've ever heard of.

677
00:43:40,783 --> 00:43:43,115
- Don't ask.
- Someone's been knotty.

678
00:43:44,887 --> 00:43:45,876
This won't hurt a bit.

679
00:43:46,122 --> 00:43:50,388
Joe, our last witch doctor,
had a spot just like that.

680
00:43:50,459 --> 00:43:54,623
- And?
- Monday, Joe. Wednesday, no Joe.

681
00:43:55,364 --> 00:43:56,695
Wednesday, no Joe?

682
00:43:56,899 --> 00:43:59,231
I can breathe! Thanks, doc!

683
00:43:59,468 --> 00:44:03,370
So this Witch Doctor's Disease
is a real thing?

684
00:44:03,706 --> 00:44:07,233
You'll find a cure.
You've got at least 48 hours!

685
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:09,403
But I've never heard of it.

686
00:44:09,478 --> 00:44:12,743
I mean... I don't have any penicillin.

687
00:44:12,815 --> 00:44:15,249
I'll need a CAT scan
just to get started!

688
00:44:15,318 --> 00:44:18,651
Have a lion look you over.
They'd be happy to.

689
00:44:29,365 --> 00:44:30,354
Ta-da!!

690
00:44:30,666 --> 00:44:33,260
- He has talent.
- Stupendous and tremendous.

691
00:44:33,336 --> 00:44:34,860
Hollah!

692
00:44:34,937 --> 00:44:39,101
Bet you've never seen that one!
Knocked 'em dead in New York!

693
00:44:39,175 --> 00:44:41,166
- Let's all give it a try!
- Let's do it!

694
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:43,910
Well, you can try all you want to,

695
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:46,005
but it takes years of practice.

696
00:44:46,082 --> 00:44:48,107
You'll never get a tight stream

697
00:44:48,184 --> 00:44:52,644
until you build up your lip muscles
to the point where you can

698
00:44:52,722 --> 00:44:54,883
purse your lips like this.
You got it?

699
00:45:08,704 --> 00:45:09,864
Ta-da!

700
00:45:13,709 --> 00:45:16,940
How did you? You guys got it
right out of the box!

701
00:45:17,013 --> 00:45:18,810
- If you can do it...
...we can do it.

702
00:45:18,881 --> 00:45:20,109
It's in our blood!

703
00:45:20,383 --> 00:45:23,113
I always thought I was a bit unique.

704
00:45:23,185 --> 00:45:24,379
We are unique!

705
00:45:24,654 --> 00:45:26,451
We are like a force of nature!

706
00:45:26,722 --> 00:45:29,384
- A million points of light!
- And dark stripes!

707
00:45:29,458 --> 00:45:31,653
Exactly the same!

708
00:45:32,561 --> 00:45:35,052
Exactly the same.

709
00:45:36,465 --> 00:45:40,060
Looks impressive,
Kowalski, but will it fly?

710
00:45:40,403 --> 00:45:43,895
Yes. If we fold it here, here and here.

711
00:45:46,075 --> 00:45:47,064
Nice.

712
00:45:59,588 --> 00:46:03,581
Oh, man. My dad thinks
I'm a total loser.

713
00:46:03,826 --> 00:46:05,589
I've ruined my parents' lives.

714
00:46:05,828 --> 00:46:07,762
That is definitely not crack-a-lackin'.

715
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:12,494
It is lackin' in the crackin',
my friend. I've gotta fix this.

716
00:46:12,768 --> 00:46:13,928
So...

717
00:46:14,937 --> 00:46:18,429
...there's...
There's something I gotta tell you.

718
00:46:18,607 --> 00:46:19,596
Hey, guys.

719
00:46:20,609 --> 00:46:22,509
Is this place great or what?!

720
00:46:22,845 --> 00:46:24,540
I'd go with "or what."

721
00:46:24,613 --> 00:46:28,276
Well, I'll tell you what.
You're not gonna believe it, but...

722
00:46:28,784 --> 00:46:31,275
...I got a date with Moto Moto.

723
00:46:32,121 --> 00:46:33,611
Who's Moto Moto?

724
00:46:33,689 --> 00:46:37,284
Oh, he's so big and handsome and big!

725
00:46:37,626 --> 00:46:39,958
- Know what "Moto Moto" means?
- Twins?

726
00:46:40,196 --> 00:46:41,959
It means, "Hot Hot."

727
00:46:42,164 --> 00:46:43,256
"Hot Hot"?

728
00:46:43,466 --> 00:46:46,128
When did you start parlez-ing African?

729
00:46:46,402 --> 00:46:47,391
It's in my blood.

730
00:46:47,636 --> 00:46:51,265
Don't worry, you can flirt around
with Mr. Hot Pants after I'm gone.

731
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:54,207
Melman, why am I the parade
and you're the rain?

732
00:46:54,276 --> 00:46:56,437
Why are you driving
your parade under my rain?

733
00:46:56,512 --> 00:46:59,208
Maybe I'll parade
in another part of town!

734
00:46:59,315 --> 00:47:00,680
Whoa, guys.

735
00:47:00,883 --> 00:47:02,373
Main Street's mine!

736
00:47:02,451 --> 00:47:04,612
Well, you can have it!

737
00:47:04,687 --> 00:47:08,817
And you can take your hotee-tot float
and Mr. Hotee Moto Moto...

738
00:47:09,091 --> 00:47:11,082
- What are you talking about?
- What are we talking about?

739
00:47:11,327 --> 00:47:12,658
Melman, just tell her.

740
00:47:12,995 --> 00:47:16,658
What? What are you...
I don't know what you're talking about.

741
00:47:16,899 --> 00:47:18,298
I guess I'll go, then.

742
00:47:18,367 --> 00:47:19,766
Don't bother.

743
00:47:19,835 --> 00:47:23,430
- Don't get up on my account.
- Melman! Gloria!

744
00:47:23,506 --> 00:47:27,840
- I thought you guys were friends!
- Marty's absolutely right.

745
00:47:27,910 --> 00:47:29,673
- Marty?
- Marty?

746
00:47:29,845 --> 00:47:30,903
Marty?

747
00:47:31,847 --> 00:47:33,508
What the heck is going on?

748
00:47:33,783 --> 00:47:38,777
You're not? Oh! He was... I thought
he... You're not him. He's... Oh.

749
00:47:38,854 --> 00:47:41,618
You thought that guy...

750
00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:42,952
...was me?

751
00:47:43,025 --> 00:47:45,789
No. I mean, yes, you... Guys, come on.

752
00:47:45,861 --> 00:47:48,022
You thought I was him?

753
00:47:48,364 --> 00:47:50,355
You guys kind of do look a little...

754
00:47:50,433 --> 00:47:53,095
You look a lot alike.
Marty, you look a lot alike.

755
00:47:53,169 --> 00:47:57,037
You laugh alike. Talk alike.
He has the same speech pattern.

756
00:47:57,106 --> 00:48:00,166
It's a little weird, really.
I mean, come on. Marty.

757
00:48:00,276 --> 00:48:03,404
So you're saying there's
nothing unique about me.

758
00:48:03,612 --> 00:48:05,705
I'm just like any other zebra.

759
00:48:05,781 --> 00:48:07,373
No. Of course you're different!

760
00:48:07,716 --> 00:48:09,047
How?

761
00:48:10,719 --> 00:48:12,880
OK, I can't tell you apart.

762
00:48:13,222 --> 00:48:16,020
Maybe you could wear
a bell or something.

763
00:48:16,092 --> 00:48:18,720
- A bell?!
- OK, not a bell. Bell's a bad idea.

764
00:48:19,061 --> 00:48:21,723
How about a T-shirt that says,
"I'm with stupid"?

765
00:48:21,964 --> 00:48:24,489
- I'm not stupid!
- Not you, stupid! Him, stupid!

766
00:48:24,733 --> 00:48:28,066
You know, while you've been doing
the prancing pony with your new posse,

767
00:48:28,304 --> 00:48:31,569
I've been having
the worst day of my life.

768
00:48:32,908 --> 00:48:35,240
It's always about you, isn't it?

769
00:48:35,578 --> 00:48:38,843
My problems are just
a little bit bigger than yours.

770
00:48:38,914 --> 00:48:41,747
I couldn't tell you apart. So what?!

771
00:48:42,418 --> 00:48:45,080
Yeah, fine. Run away, Marty! Run away!

772
00:48:45,321 --> 00:48:48,415
That's what you do best!
Just like back in New York!

773
00:48:48,657 --> 00:48:51,922
I'm right here.
But you can't tell that, right?

774
00:48:54,196 --> 00:48:57,461
Your one-of-a-million friend
hopes you enjoy

775
00:48:57,533 --> 00:49:00,366
your bigger-than-anyone-else's
problems alone!

776
00:49:00,469 --> 00:49:04,064
Good, leave! I don't need you
to help me solve my problems!

777
00:49:04,106 --> 00:49:07,269
You're a dime a dozen!
I can't tell which one's Marty!

778
00:49:07,343 --> 00:49:10,369
Which one's Marty? Wait a minute.
Oh, yeah, I don't care!

779
00:49:10,446 --> 00:49:13,108
Nice hat, you showoff!

780
00:49:18,621 --> 00:49:19,952
Marty...

781
00:49:20,956 --> 00:49:22,446
...don't go.

782
00:49:22,791 --> 00:49:23,159
Giddy-up, giddy-up!

783
00:49:23,159 --> 00:49:24,456
Giddy-up, giddy-up!

784
00:49:27,463 --> 00:49:28,794
Look, Maurice!

785
00:49:29,031 --> 00:49:31,363
The perfect spot for my summer palace!

786
00:49:31,634 --> 00:49:35,468
Please fill in all these holes
and relocate the riff-raff.

787
00:49:36,572 --> 00:49:39,803
- Who'd leave a perfectly good head?
- What a waste.

788
00:49:40,142 --> 00:49:43,134
Tell me about it. I'm in my prime here.

789
00:49:43,479 --> 00:49:45,709
I'm terminal, you know?

790
00:49:46,715 --> 00:49:50,242
I probably only have
another two days left to live.

791
00:49:50,486 --> 00:49:52,647
That's a bummer, man.

792
00:49:52,988 --> 00:49:55,650
If I, King Julien... that's my name...

793
00:49:55,991 --> 00:49:58,152
...only had two days left to live,

794
00:49:58,494 --> 00:49:59,927
I would do all the things

795
00:49:59,995 --> 00:50:02,486
- I've ever dreamed of doing.
- Like what?

796
00:50:02,565 --> 00:50:05,591
I'd love to become
a professional whistler.

797
00:50:05,668 --> 00:50:09,934
I'm pretty amazing at it now,
but I want to get even better,

798
00:50:10,005 --> 00:50:11,996
make my living out of it.

799
00:50:20,349 --> 00:50:25,616
You know what else I would do?
I would invade a neighboring country

800
00:50:25,688 --> 00:50:29,624
and impose my own ideology,
even if they didn't want it!

801
00:50:29,692 --> 00:50:31,626
Easy for you to say. You're a king.

802
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:35,853
Yes. And you are
only just a sad little head.

803
00:50:36,098 --> 00:50:39,966
There must be something
you want to do before you die!

804
00:50:40,035 --> 00:50:43,971
- There is this one thing.
- What? Tell me.

805
00:50:44,039 --> 00:50:47,031
- No, I couldn't.
- What is it?

806
00:50:47,109 --> 00:50:49,703
I never told Gloria
how I feel about her.

807
00:50:49,778 --> 00:50:51,643
What is it? Please tell me!

808
00:50:51,714 --> 00:50:55,480
I never had the guts
to tell Gloria how I feel about her.

809
00:50:55,551 --> 00:50:57,143
How I've always felt about her.

810
00:50:57,219 --> 00:50:59,050
Fine. Don't tell me!

811
00:51:00,222 --> 00:51:04,318
Is it a woman?
You didn't tell me it's a woman.

812
00:51:04,393 --> 00:51:08,727
What are you afraid of?
You're a dead man anyway.

813
00:51:09,064 --> 00:51:10,998
Yeah. Yeah.

814
00:51:11,066 --> 00:51:13,000
You're right.

815
00:51:13,068 --> 00:51:16,333
You've got to march
right up to this woman.

816
00:51:16,405 --> 00:51:19,738
Look her right in the eye. Lean forward.

817
00:51:20,075 --> 00:51:22,566
Just a little, or almost all the way.

818
00:51:22,911 --> 00:51:26,847
Then you let her lean forward
a little until you're...

819
00:51:26,915 --> 00:51:30,351
...just lips' distance
away from each other.

820
00:51:30,419 --> 00:51:34,082
Then you tell her how much you hate her.

821
00:51:34,423 --> 00:51:38,655
Actually, it's more like love her.

822
00:51:38,727 --> 00:51:41,594
Oh, you sly dog! Woof, woof!

823
00:51:41,930 --> 00:51:45,263
You're a real player. Now listen to me.

824
00:51:45,501 --> 00:51:48,163
You got to rise up. You hearing me?

825
00:51:48,437 --> 00:51:49,836
- He didn't hear you.
- I can't hear you!

826
00:51:50,506 --> 00:51:52,940
- You got to rise up!
- Rising up!

827
00:51:53,509 --> 00:51:56,501
- Get out of the hole!
- I'm rising out of the ground!

828
00:51:56,779 --> 00:51:58,610
- He's rising, Maurice.
- I'm rising, Maurice!

829
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:01,611
- Rising!
- You go right up to this woman!

830
00:52:02,518 --> 00:52:03,507
Do you feel it?

831
00:52:03,952 --> 00:52:06,284
- Go up to her face!
- Tell the truth!

832
00:52:06,622 --> 00:52:11,525
- I'm going to tell her!
- Then you say, "Baby, I dig you!"

833
00:52:11,794 --> 00:52:14,786
Yeah! I'm going to do it!
I'm going to do it!

834
00:52:15,130 --> 00:52:17,394
I love that happy little head.

835
00:52:18,067 --> 00:52:19,625
She love

836
00:52:19,868 --> 00:52:21,529
Moto Moto

837
00:52:22,204 --> 00:52:23,728
She love

838
00:52:23,972 --> 00:52:25,303
Moto Moto

839
00:52:25,541 --> 00:52:28,977
She loves me
She loves my eyes

840
00:52:29,645 --> 00:52:32,978
She loves me
She loves my thighs

841
00:52:33,315 --> 00:52:35,146
She loves my roundness

842
00:52:35,484 --> 00:52:39,318
She love that I'm chunky
She love that I'm plumpy

843
00:52:39,655 --> 00:52:43,489
She love my heftiness
She love my zestiness

844
00:52:43,826 --> 00:52:47,660
She love me restlessly
She love me forever

845
00:52:47,996 --> 00:52:49,691
She love me...

846
00:52:49,832 --> 00:52:51,424
...'cause she love me

847
00:52:51,667 --> 00:52:52,998
Moto Moto...

848
00:52:53,502 --> 00:52:56,665
...before things get too serious, well,

849
00:52:57,005 --> 00:53:00,998
I was wondering,
if I were to, for example, stay here...

850
00:53:01,343 --> 00:53:02,674
...I'd like to ask you...

851
00:53:03,011 --> 00:53:07,345
Let your candied lips be
the messengers to my... ear canal.

852
00:53:07,916 --> 00:53:09,781
I have so many questions.

853
00:53:10,018 --> 00:53:13,454
I promise the answer will always be yes.

854
00:53:13,522 --> 00:53:16,184
Unless no is required.

855
00:53:16,258 --> 00:53:20,524
So what is it about me
that you find so interesting?

856
00:53:21,263 --> 00:53:24,130
You're the most plumpenest girl
I've ever met.

857
00:53:24,199 --> 00:53:26,133
OK. Other than that.

858
00:53:26,201 --> 00:53:27,862
Let's see.

859
00:53:27,936 --> 00:53:30,928
Yeah, well, you know... you chunky.

860
00:53:31,874 --> 00:53:33,205
Right.

861
00:53:35,210 --> 00:53:37,542
My gosh, girl, you huge.

862
00:53:37,813 --> 00:53:38,802
You said that.

863
00:53:39,047 --> 00:53:41,038
Yeah, that's right.

864
00:53:41,884 --> 00:53:43,715
We don't have to talk no more.

865
00:53:43,952 --> 00:53:45,146
Gloria!

866
00:53:46,388 --> 00:53:47,480
Gloria.

867
00:53:47,723 --> 00:53:48,883
Melman.

868
00:53:50,392 --> 00:53:54,726
Melman, I want you to meet Moto Moto.

869
00:53:55,731 --> 00:53:59,895
Moto Moto. Yeah, nice to meet you.

870
00:54:00,235 --> 00:54:03,864
- I guess I...
- It's OK, Melman.

871
00:54:03,939 --> 00:54:05,463
Apology accepted.

872
00:54:05,541 --> 00:54:10,240
Oh. Yeah, right, that.
That's why I... Good.

873
00:54:11,246 --> 00:54:13,714
OK. Well, that's it, then.

874
00:54:13,782 --> 00:54:16,910
Good. We're kind of busy here, man.

875
00:54:17,252 --> 00:54:19,743
No. No, that's not it.

876
00:54:21,256 --> 00:54:24,248
Listen, Mototo, you better treat
this lady like a queen.

877
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:28,093
Because you, my friend,
you found yourself the perfect woman.

878
00:54:28,330 --> 00:54:30,855
If I was ever so lucky
to find the perfect woman,

879
00:54:30,933 --> 00:54:34,699
I'd give her flowers every day.
And not just any flowers. OK?

880
00:54:34,770 --> 00:54:38,706
Her favorites are orchids.
White. And breakfast in bed.

881
00:54:38,774 --> 00:54:41,140
Six loaves of wheat toast,
butter on both sides.

882
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:42,871
No crust, the way she likes it.

883
00:54:43,111 --> 00:54:46,444
I'd be her shoulder to cry on
and her best friend.

884
00:54:46,682 --> 00:54:50,209
I'd spend every day thinking
of how to make her laugh.

885
00:54:50,285 --> 00:54:53,948
She has the most amazing laugh.

886
00:54:57,292 --> 00:55:00,284
That's what I would do if I were you.

887
00:55:00,629 --> 00:55:02,961
But I'm not, so you do it.

888
00:55:04,299 --> 00:55:05,960
OK.

889
00:55:06,969 --> 00:55:08,300
What?

890
00:55:08,971 --> 00:55:11,804
That was beautiful.

891
00:55:12,474 --> 00:55:15,307
Anyways, where were we?

892
00:55:15,811 --> 00:55:17,142
I'm "huge"?

893
00:55:18,981 --> 00:55:20,608
Surprised to see me, Makunga?

894
00:55:20,682 --> 00:55:23,913
Well, I'm here to set things straight,
like a real lion!

895
00:55:23,986 --> 00:55:28,320
Is this real enough for you? How
about this? This is for setting me up!

896
00:55:28,390 --> 00:55:32,383
This is for stealing my dad's job!
This is for humiliating my family!

897
00:55:32,461 --> 00:55:34,929
And making me look like a fool!

898
00:55:52,014 --> 00:55:54,676
Had enough? Sure, fly away!

899
00:55:55,017 --> 00:55:56,348
Coward.

900
00:56:07,529 --> 00:56:09,861
The water. It's gone.

901
00:56:10,198 --> 00:56:12,029
It's never gone dry before.

902
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:14,967
- We'll need a lot more dying holes.
- How could this happen?

903
00:56:15,037 --> 00:56:18,302
Out of my way! What is going on here?!

904
00:56:18,373 --> 00:56:21,240
The watering hole is dry!
There's barely water for one of us!

905
00:56:21,310 --> 00:56:23,642
- Good observation, Shirley.
- I'm Bobby.

906
00:56:23,712 --> 00:56:25,202
Makunga, what do we do?

907
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:26,770
Quiet!

908
00:56:27,215 --> 00:56:32,209
Listen up! I'm afraid there is only
one solution to this horrible crisis:

909
00:56:33,221 --> 00:56:34,950
We'll all have to fight for it.

910
00:56:35,023 --> 00:56:37,548
- We can't fight for it.
- That's crazy.

911
00:56:39,061 --> 00:56:40,551
That's not fair. You'd win!

912
00:56:40,729 --> 00:56:42,060
Exactly, Shirley.

913
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:43,219
I'm Bob...

914
00:56:43,799 --> 00:56:47,132
Sorry, folks, but life isn't fair.
I'm in charge now,

915
00:56:47,402 --> 00:56:50,394
thanks to Alakay, the dancing lion.

916
00:56:50,672 --> 00:56:54,199
Please, Makunga, this is
the only water on the reserve.

917
00:56:54,276 --> 00:56:58,235
If you're thirsty, you'll have to look
for water off the reserve.

918
00:56:58,580 --> 00:57:00,844
- Off the reserve?
- It's too dangerous!

919
00:57:00,949 --> 00:57:02,382
Hunters would shoot us!

920
00:57:02,417 --> 00:57:04,351
No one leaves the reserve and survives!

921
00:57:04,419 --> 00:57:06,250
I left the reserve!

922
00:57:06,755 --> 00:57:08,416
And survived.

923
00:57:09,758 --> 00:57:11,692
I can do something about this.

924
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:16,094
Looks like a clogged pipe, like we
get in New York. I'll travel upriver...

925
00:57:16,164 --> 00:57:18,291
- Upriver?
- Off the reserve?

926
00:57:18,367 --> 00:57:19,493
You?

927
00:57:20,435 --> 00:57:23,563
Yeah. I'll unclog the pipe
and bring back your water.

928
00:57:23,639 --> 00:57:28,770
Great! I'd help you pack, but by the
looks of that hat, I see you're all set!

929
00:57:29,778 --> 00:57:34,442
Fine. Go ahead, laugh. Laugh
your mane off. I'll prove you wrong.

930
00:57:35,050 --> 00:57:37,610
Maybe you should try
a little rain dance.

931
00:57:43,525 --> 00:57:44,856
Zuba would know what to do.

932
00:57:45,127 --> 00:57:46,958
- Where's Zuba?
- You don't care about us.

933
00:57:47,195 --> 00:57:49,288
Zuba should be in charge, not you.

934
00:57:53,969 --> 00:57:55,527
All right, fine!

935
00:57:55,804 --> 00:57:59,296
As an added measure,
I will consult with Zuba!

936
00:58:05,814 --> 00:58:07,145
Marty?

937
00:58:16,158 --> 00:58:17,989
Hey! Marty!

938
00:58:22,831 --> 00:58:24,321
Marty?

939
00:58:27,169 --> 00:58:28,761
Marty.

940
00:58:28,904 --> 00:58:30,496
Where'd you get the fruity hat?

941
00:58:30,839 --> 00:58:33,000
Excuse me! Excuse me!

942
00:58:33,341 --> 00:58:36,333
Hi. Is Marty in there?

943
00:58:37,012 --> 00:58:39,173
Anyone seen Marty?

944
00:58:41,450 --> 00:58:43,350
Which one of us is Marty?

945
00:58:43,852 --> 00:58:46,514
All right. Well, if you see him,

946
00:58:46,588 --> 00:58:49,022
tell him his friend Alex
came to say goodbye.

947
00:58:49,091 --> 00:58:51,855
Goodbye? Don't go. Where are you going?

948
00:58:51,927 --> 00:58:55,294
- Can we come?
- No. I have to do this alone.

949
00:58:55,363 --> 00:58:57,524
You can't leave the reserve!

950
00:59:08,944 --> 00:59:10,275
What are you doing?

951
00:59:10,545 --> 00:59:12,706
- They'll get your hat.
- Hunters are everywhere!

952
00:59:13,715 --> 00:59:15,205
Could you leave the hat?

953
00:59:15,283 --> 00:59:16,944
Marty! I know you're in there.

954
00:59:18,053 --> 00:59:21,045
Before I go, I got something
I want to say.

955
00:59:22,057 --> 00:59:24,321
You've been a great friend.

956
00:59:24,392 --> 00:59:27,884
You've helped me so often
to see the bright side of my problems

957
00:59:27,963 --> 00:59:29,828
that I never think of you having any.

958
00:59:31,233 --> 00:59:33,724
I wasn't there for you
when you needed me.

959
00:59:34,236 --> 00:59:36,067
Just like back at the zoo.

960
00:59:36,972 --> 00:59:41,238
What kind of friend does that make me?
A pretty lousy friend, I guess.

961
00:59:42,077 --> 00:59:43,738
I just want you to know that I...

962
00:59:44,746 --> 00:59:46,577
You're one in a million.

963
00:59:47,082 --> 00:59:48,913
This is touching.

964
00:59:48,984 --> 00:59:50,417
It is touching.

965
00:59:50,752 --> 00:59:54,244
So could you turn around
so I can tell you to your face?

966
00:59:54,923 --> 00:59:56,914
That's right. Gotcha!

967
00:59:57,259 --> 00:59:59,853
I see you in there! Yeah, you.

968
00:59:59,928 --> 01:00:01,862
You, right there.

969
01:00:01,930 --> 01:00:06,196
Twelfth row, two hundred
and third from the left.

970
01:00:06,268 --> 01:00:07,667
That's you, Marty.

971
01:00:08,103 --> 01:00:09,764
I know it's you.

972
01:00:11,606 --> 01:00:13,665
Know what makes you special?

973
01:00:14,009 --> 01:00:18,446
These guys are white with black stripes.
You're black with white stripes.

974
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:20,341
You're a dreamer, Marty.

975
01:00:20,615 --> 01:00:24,278
Always have been.
You have great taste in music

976
01:00:24,619 --> 01:00:26,951
and horrible taste in friends.

977
01:00:27,289 --> 01:00:30,452
Well, not Melman and Gloria, but me.

978
01:00:32,794 --> 01:00:34,227
OK, I'm in.

979
01:00:34,296 --> 01:00:36,628
Marty, you can't come with me.

980
01:00:36,698 --> 01:00:38,461
You don't have a choice.

981
01:00:43,305 --> 01:00:45,967
- People are out there!
- You're crazy! Come back!

982
01:00:46,308 --> 01:00:47,969
The people will get you!

983
01:00:48,310 --> 01:00:50,369
Don't lose the hat!

984
01:00:51,246 --> 01:00:52,577
Bye, hat!

985
01:00:56,151 --> 01:00:57,243
Any water?

986
01:00:58,153 --> 01:01:00,986
No, just more diamonds and gold.

987
01:01:06,261 --> 01:01:07,660
Don't give up hope.

988
01:01:07,729 --> 01:01:10,630
Listen up! I will help you!

989
01:01:10,699 --> 01:01:13,827
There's only one way
to get your precious water.

990
01:01:14,402 --> 01:01:17,166
I, your beloved King Julien

991
01:01:17,672 --> 01:01:22,336
must simply make a small sacrifice
to my good friends, the water gods,

992
01:01:22,677 --> 01:01:25,510
in the volcano!

993
01:01:29,017 --> 01:01:30,177
What does that do?

994
01:01:30,418 --> 01:01:33,080
What does that do? Excellent question.

995
01:01:33,355 --> 01:01:36,449
My sacrifice goes in the volcano.

996
01:01:36,524 --> 01:01:40,517
The friendly gods eat up my sacrifice.

997
01:01:40,862 --> 01:01:43,023
"Thank you for the sacrifice."

998
01:01:43,098 --> 01:01:45,965
"Here, have another."
"No, I've had enough."

999
01:01:46,034 --> 01:01:48,400
"I'll be insulted
unless you have another."

1000
01:01:48,470 --> 01:01:50,904
"I don't want another sacrifice!"

1001
01:01:50,972 --> 01:01:54,032
"Look at you! You're skinny!"
"No! I've had enough!"

1002
01:01:56,544 --> 01:01:59,638
The gods eat the sacrifice.
They are grateful.

1003
01:01:59,748 --> 01:02:03,582
They give me some water,
and then I give it to you.

1004
01:02:03,618 --> 01:02:04,880
What?

1005
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:06,446
Does it work?

1006
01:02:06,888 --> 01:02:09,220
No! I mean, yes.

1007
01:02:09,724 --> 01:02:11,214
Well, Maurice?

1008
01:02:11,559 --> 01:02:13,891
Ah, it's fifty-fifty.

1009
01:02:14,896 --> 01:02:16,727
We'll do it!

1010
01:02:17,732 --> 01:02:19,063
Excellent!

1011
01:02:19,734 --> 01:02:23,602
Now all I need is someone
who would like to go into the volcano

1012
01:02:23,672 --> 01:02:25,663
and get eaten by gods.

1013
01:02:26,408 --> 01:02:28,968
Any hands! Hands, anybody!

1014
01:02:29,044 --> 01:02:32,571
I need someone, perhaps
who has never found love,

1015
01:02:32,914 --> 01:02:37,817
who could look death straight
in the eyeball. A real, genuine hero.

1016
01:02:37,886 --> 01:02:39,911
- I'll do it.
- Melman?

1017
01:02:49,431 --> 01:02:53,094
Hurry up! Before we all
come to our senses!

1018
01:02:54,169 --> 01:02:56,160
Melman, what is wrong with you?

1019
01:02:56,438 --> 01:03:01,102
I'm dying anyway. If there's a chance
it'll get you water, it's worth it.

1020
01:03:01,443 --> 01:03:03,206
Are you nuts?

1021
01:03:03,278 --> 01:03:05,974
I want you to know, back at the zoo,

1022
01:03:06,047 --> 01:03:09,380
it was never the doctors
or prescriptions that kept me going.

1023
01:03:09,617 --> 01:03:11,710
It was always you.

1024
01:03:11,786 --> 01:03:14,220
Seeing you every day.

1025
01:03:14,289 --> 01:03:16,450
That's what kept me going.

1026
01:03:20,128 --> 01:03:22,119
Melman! Wait!

1027
01:03:23,198 --> 01:03:27,862
Melman! Melman! Melman!

1028
01:03:30,638 --> 01:03:33,129
You going to mope like this all day?

1029
01:03:33,975 --> 01:03:35,465
Don't "hmph" me.

1030
01:03:35,744 --> 01:03:39,407
Listen, Zuba. A miracle happened.

1031
01:03:39,481 --> 01:03:44,350
Our son came back to us. How come
that is not good enough for you?

1032
01:03:44,419 --> 01:03:46,546
What are you saying, woman?

1033
01:03:47,489 --> 01:03:51,653
We lost him once, Zuba.
Let's not lose him again.

1034
01:04:01,002 --> 01:04:02,333
Zuba!

1035
01:04:03,338 --> 01:04:04,999
- Zuba!
- Get out of here!

1036
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:06,901
What do you want?

1037
01:04:06,975 --> 01:04:08,169
It's awful.

1038
01:04:08,843 --> 01:04:10,572
The watering hole is dried up.

1039
01:04:10,645 --> 01:04:13,580
Dried up? That's impossible!

1040
01:04:13,648 --> 01:04:15,513
There's nothing left!

1041
01:04:15,583 --> 01:04:19,349
You're alpha lion, Makunga.
What are you gonna do about it?

1042
01:04:19,421 --> 01:04:23,653
Your son, Alakay, he said he
could fix it. He's gone upriver.

1043
01:04:23,725 --> 01:04:25,317
- Off the reserve?!
- No!

1044
01:04:25,393 --> 01:04:28,123
I tried to stop him.
I told him it was suicide.

1045
01:04:28,196 --> 01:04:30,460
He was determined
to prove himself to you.

1046
01:04:31,699 --> 01:04:34,600
You stay here, in case he comes back!

1047
01:04:37,205 --> 01:04:38,866
Hurry, Zuba!

1048
01:04:42,143 --> 01:04:43,804
I'm so parched.

1049
01:04:49,384 --> 01:04:52,547
Is this place starting to freak you out?

1050
01:04:52,620 --> 01:04:57,148
We'll slip in, find the problem.
Hunters will never know we were here.

1051
01:04:57,225 --> 01:04:58,954
Why are we doing this?

1052
01:04:59,227 --> 01:05:02,560
Maybe my dad will think I'm...

1053
01:05:03,064 --> 01:05:05,430
I want to show him I'm a real lion.

1054
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:08,663
As opposed to a chocolate lion.

1055
01:05:08,736 --> 01:05:14,174
I know this may sound hard to believe,
but apparently, lions don't dance.

1056
01:05:14,242 --> 01:05:15,402
What?!

1057
01:05:16,311 --> 01:05:18,176
As far as my dad is concerned.

1058
01:05:18,246 --> 01:05:20,840
As far as people are concerned,
you're a hit.

1059
01:05:21,082 --> 01:05:24,245
In New York. This is Africa...
much tougher crowd.

1060
01:05:24,319 --> 01:05:26,310
Marty, this is it!

1061
01:05:27,422 --> 01:05:29,913
This is the clog! Come on.

1062
01:05:36,931 --> 01:05:39,092
Well, there's the water.

1063
01:05:41,269 --> 01:05:43,760
Stay down. Look at that.

1064
01:05:44,105 --> 01:05:46,437
Knit one, purl two.

1065
01:05:46,508 --> 01:05:47,600
It's her.

1066
01:05:47,675 --> 01:05:49,370
- Is this right?
- Very good.

1067
01:05:49,444 --> 01:05:51,378
Nana, slow down.

1068
01:05:51,446 --> 01:05:54,210
You're a little tangled, aren't you?

1069
01:05:54,282 --> 01:05:56,614
No, don't pull. I'll do it.

1070
01:05:57,552 --> 01:05:59,019
We need dynamite. Got any?

1071
01:05:59,287 --> 01:06:03,280
Oh, snap! I just used
my last stick this morning!

1072
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:07,289
- Savages!
- Evasive maneuvers!

1073
01:06:07,562 --> 01:06:09,928
- Serpentine, serpentine!
- Squiggly squid maneuver!

1074
01:06:09,998 --> 01:06:12,796
Zag, zig-zag, zig ziggy zag!

1075
01:06:13,134 --> 01:06:15,466
No, no! Squiggly squid!

1076
01:06:15,803 --> 01:06:16,895
Etch A Sketch!

1077
01:06:17,138 --> 01:06:20,130
That's too complex! Octopus, octopus!

1078
01:06:22,310 --> 01:06:25,643
- Run, Marty!
- I can't leave you here!

1079
01:06:26,381 --> 01:06:29,714
Go get help! Squiggly squid maneuver!
Go! Go! Squiggly squid!

1080
01:06:29,984 --> 01:06:32,919
Etch A Sketch! Etch A Sketch!

1081
01:06:34,189 --> 01:06:37,249
Save us
We love you

1082
01:06:37,325 --> 01:06:38,656
OK.

1083
01:06:38,993 --> 01:06:41,655
OK, OK, OK.

1084
01:06:48,603 --> 01:06:50,366
- Save us
- Melman

1085
01:06:50,438 --> 01:06:52,167
- We love you
- Melman

1086
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:53,229
Save us

1087
01:06:53,308 --> 01:06:55,742
OK, here we go. OK, OK.

1088
01:06:55,810 --> 01:06:57,801
- Melman
- We love you

1089
01:06:57,879 --> 01:06:59,437
- Melman
- Save us

1090
01:06:59,547 --> 01:07:02,209
Here we go! Here we go!

1091
01:07:02,951 --> 01:07:05,283
- What's all the hoopla about?
- Joe?

1092
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:08,011
Joe the Witch Doctor?
We thought you were dead!

1093
01:07:08,289 --> 01:07:11,747
So did I. Then I realized
I'm covered in brown spots.

1094
01:07:12,026 --> 01:07:14,859
So Melman's not dying!

1095
01:07:15,363 --> 01:07:18,025
- Melman's not dying!
- Oh, no!

1096
01:07:18,366 --> 01:07:19,355
Melman!

1097
01:07:19,634 --> 01:07:20,965
Move!

1098
01:07:21,202 --> 01:07:24,968
Don't do this! Julien,
stop this! This is crazy!

1099
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:29,908
Oh, suddenly throwing a giraffe
into a volcano to make water is crazy!

1100
01:07:29,978 --> 01:07:30,967
Yes!

1101
01:07:33,548 --> 01:07:37,507
- Please, Melman! Stop!
- Gloria?

1102
01:07:37,585 --> 01:07:39,644
- You can't do this!
- Why not?

1103
01:07:39,887 --> 01:07:41,218
Because...

1104
01:08:00,475 --> 01:08:02,136
You can't do this, Melman.

1105
01:08:02,410 --> 01:08:04,071
First, that hurts.

1106
01:08:04,345 --> 01:08:07,473
Second, I've only got
18 hours to live, anyway.

1107
01:08:07,548 --> 01:08:10,073
Melman, I gotta know...

1108
01:08:11,252 --> 01:08:13,743
...did you mean those things
you said about me?

1109
01:08:14,756 --> 01:08:16,155
Of course I did.

1110
01:08:16,491 --> 01:08:18,584
- That's crazy.
- It is?

1111
01:08:21,262 --> 01:08:25,255
It's crazy to think I had to go
halfway around the world...

1112
01:08:25,833 --> 01:08:28,597
...to find out the perfect guy for me

1113
01:08:28,936 --> 01:08:30,597
lived right next door.

1114
01:08:31,606 --> 01:08:33,938
Then it's you and me, neighbor.

1115
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:36,837
You and me for the next 18 hours.

1116
01:08:37,111 --> 01:08:39,272
I'll take whatever you got.

1117
01:08:43,618 --> 01:08:46,883
- Maurice, what happened?
- I believe the fat lady has sung.

1118
01:08:46,954 --> 01:08:49,787
- What's going on here?
- Marty!

1119
01:08:50,058 --> 01:08:53,789
Alex is in big trouble!
We got to get upriver fast!

1120
01:08:54,062 --> 01:08:56,292
- What about the plane?
- Perfect! Come on!

1121
01:08:59,067 --> 01:09:02,867
The plane won't be fixed
until the suits meet our demands.

1122
01:09:02,937 --> 01:09:04,632
Now, maternity leave.

1123
01:09:04,706 --> 01:09:08,198
Maternity leave? You're all males.

1124
01:09:08,276 --> 01:09:10,767
We need that plane for a rescue mission.

1125
01:09:10,845 --> 01:09:13,780
There's nothing I can do
until we bust up this union.

1126
01:09:13,848 --> 01:09:17,215
I'll bust up all of you
if you don't get this plane going.

1127
01:09:17,285 --> 01:09:21,619
Can't you see these commies have
my hands tied? No maternity leave.

1128
01:09:24,192 --> 01:09:29,186
Maybe a certain someone wouldn't want
these blowing around on the savanna.

1129
01:09:38,306 --> 01:09:40,968
All right. You get your maternity leave.

1130
01:09:42,377 --> 01:09:43,708
Finally.

1131
01:09:48,383 --> 01:09:51,648
Where we headed?
What's going on? Where are we going?

1132
01:09:51,719 --> 01:09:55,382
Oh, no! Please! Don't put me there! No!

1133
01:09:55,723 --> 01:09:57,384
This is wrong.

1134
01:09:57,458 --> 01:10:01,019
You see? You are survivors.

1135
01:10:01,095 --> 01:10:04,895
Now, how about a nice lion casserole?

1136
01:10:05,333 --> 01:10:06,857
You can't eat a lion.

1137
01:10:06,934 --> 01:10:08,868
Don't worry, it tastes like chicken.

1138
01:10:08,936 --> 01:10:11,234
No, no, no. Don't listen to her.

1139
01:10:12,073 --> 01:10:14,234
She's out of her mind, people!

1140
01:10:16,377 --> 01:10:18,072
I'm from New York City!

1141
01:10:18,346 --> 01:10:20,814
It's me, Alex the lion!
From Central Park!

1142
01:10:28,423 --> 01:10:29,412
Dad!

1143
01:10:30,358 --> 01:10:34,590
What were you thinking, son?
You got no business being out here!

1144
01:10:36,597 --> 01:10:38,428
Stay behind me.

1145
01:10:38,499 --> 01:10:41,696
They're New Yorkers.
They're just rude and frightened people.

1146
01:10:41,936 --> 01:10:43,267
Stay back!

1147
01:10:43,604 --> 01:10:45,595
You'd let your dinner get away?

1148
01:10:51,946 --> 01:10:55,279
- What are you doing?
- The only thing I know how to do.

1149
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:00,509
What the heck?

1150
01:11:05,626 --> 01:11:07,958
Hey, I know those moves.

1151
01:11:08,396 --> 01:11:09,454
Alex?

1152
01:11:12,967 --> 01:11:15,197
- It's Alex the lion!
- From Central Park!

1153
01:11:15,536 --> 01:11:16,901
It is Alex!

1154
01:11:16,971 --> 01:11:19,633
Only one lion can move like that!

1155
01:11:24,979 --> 01:11:26,310
He's beautiful.

1156
01:11:26,547 --> 01:11:27,536
I can't believe it.

1157
01:11:34,322 --> 01:11:36,483
How does he do that?

1158
01:11:49,504 --> 01:11:50,562
What are you doing?

1159
01:11:50,838 --> 01:11:53,500
I'm dancing with my son! I think.

1160
01:11:53,841 --> 01:11:55,331
Don't think, Dad. Feel!

1161
01:11:56,344 --> 01:11:58,005
Butterfly!

1162
01:12:00,681 --> 01:12:02,512
I'm feeling it! I'm feeling it!

1163
01:12:14,362 --> 01:12:16,353
Roar!

1164
01:12:26,374 --> 01:12:29,366
That was beautiful. Now let's eat!

1165
01:12:29,710 --> 01:12:30,938
Dad, look out!

1166
01:12:33,047 --> 01:12:34,207
What the...

1167
01:12:34,482 --> 01:12:36,040
Alex! Get in!

1168
01:12:36,284 --> 01:12:39,879
She's got a gun! Get out while we can!

1169
01:12:40,154 --> 01:12:41,746
- What?
- She's got a gun!

1170
01:12:41,889 --> 01:12:44,221
Get out while we can! Pass it on!

1171
01:12:47,895 --> 01:12:52,389
He said let's have some fun
and take out the dam. Basset hound.

1172
01:12:52,633 --> 01:12:55,727
Skipper! Alex wants to take out the dam.

1173
01:12:55,970 --> 01:12:58,302
All right! But it's his funeral.

1174
01:12:59,407 --> 01:13:02,240
- Hard to port!
- Aye-aye, Skippy!

1175
01:13:02,577 --> 01:13:05,068
Bring it on! Bring it on!

1176
01:13:11,419 --> 01:13:13,751
Come back! That's my dinner!

1177
01:13:13,988 --> 01:13:15,649
Kowalski, full throttle.

1178
01:13:18,259 --> 01:13:19,248
Music!

1179
01:13:20,328 --> 01:13:22,853
- I like this song.
- It never gets old.

1180
01:13:23,097 --> 01:13:26,999
It does have a catchy hook.
Come about! Bring her in low!

1181
01:13:27,768 --> 01:13:31,260
Hold onto your skirts!
It's dam-busting time!

1182
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:35,603
Hold on tight, baby! Here we go!

1183
01:13:36,777 --> 01:13:39,439
Tell them no! Pull up! They'll kill us!

1184
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:42,672
There's got to be another way!
Pass it on!

1185
01:13:45,886 --> 01:13:50,118
They say no pull up. Kill us.
There's no other way. Basset hound.

1186
01:13:50,358 --> 01:13:51,689
Are you sure?

1187
01:13:51,959 --> 01:13:56,453
Men, there is no sacrifice greater
than someone else's.

1188
01:13:56,797 --> 01:13:58,128
No! Medic!

1189
01:14:02,803 --> 01:14:03,963
Ramming speed!

1190
01:14:08,709 --> 01:14:09,801
Bring it on!

1191
01:14:12,146 --> 01:14:13,977
Bad kitties.

1192
01:14:21,656 --> 01:14:24,648
I don't know
why the sacrifice didn't work.

1193
01:14:24,992 --> 01:14:27,324
The science seemed so solid.

1194
01:14:27,728 --> 01:14:32,495
I'd jump right in that volcano
if I wasn't so good at whistling.

1195
01:14:42,176 --> 01:14:44,167
It's you! I found you!

1196
01:14:44,412 --> 01:14:45,401
Mort?

1197
01:14:48,182 --> 01:14:49,843
Bad fishy!

1198
01:14:59,860 --> 01:15:01,760
I wonder if the gods like seafood.

1199
01:15:02,096 --> 01:15:03,688
Let's find out.

1200
01:15:05,199 --> 01:15:06,530
Look, Maurice.

1201
01:15:08,969 --> 01:15:10,698
- That was quick.
- I did it!

1202
01:15:11,038 --> 01:15:13,529
I did it! I did it!

1203
01:15:14,875 --> 01:15:15,864
OK, you did it!

1204
01:15:16,110 --> 01:15:17,873
Oh, yes!!

1205
01:15:44,004 --> 01:15:44,993
Look!

1206
01:15:45,573 --> 01:15:47,404
- It's Alakay!
- It's Zuba!

1207
01:15:48,576 --> 01:15:49,907
You did it!

1208
01:15:50,411 --> 01:15:52,402
Alakay, Zuba, you did it!

1209
01:15:58,753 --> 01:16:00,744
Zuba! Alakay!

1210
01:16:01,355 --> 01:16:02,344
You're back!

1211
01:16:04,158 --> 01:16:06,149
I'm so glad you're safe!

1212
01:16:07,094 --> 01:16:08,755
Out of my way.

1213
01:16:09,430 --> 01:16:11,762
Well, well, well.

1214
01:16:12,767 --> 01:16:17,261
You know, Zuba, if I remember correctly,
you quit the pride.

1215
01:16:17,605 --> 01:16:19,436
And you were kicked out.

1216
01:16:19,707 --> 01:16:23,438
So don't think that this
changes anything.

1217
01:16:23,711 --> 01:16:28,512
You're right. In fact, we humbly present
you with this token of appreciation.

1218
01:16:28,783 --> 01:16:31,047
A man bag. Very popular where I'm from.

1219
01:16:31,118 --> 01:16:33,484
- Don't know what to say.
- Still be tough and carry your stuff.

1220
01:16:33,554 --> 01:16:38,719
Does the strap adjust? This will go
very nicely for me when I go out hiking.

1221
01:16:38,959 --> 01:16:40,950
But you're still banished.

1222
01:16:41,195 --> 01:16:42,958
We figured you'd say that.

1223
01:16:45,132 --> 01:16:47,293
My handbag!

1224
01:16:48,068 --> 01:16:49,535
You bad kitty!

1225
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:54,998
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1226
01:17:05,553 --> 01:17:07,544
You deserve this, son.

1227
01:17:08,656 --> 01:17:10,817
Welcome to the pride.

1228
01:17:15,429 --> 01:17:18,330
Thanks, Dad. But this belongs to you.

1229
01:17:18,666 --> 01:17:21,157
No, son. To us!

1230
01:17:26,340 --> 01:17:30,504
My son! The King of New York!

1231
01:17:32,179 --> 01:17:34,170
That's my baby!

1232
01:17:41,522 --> 01:17:44,514
Love transcends all differences.

1233
01:17:45,192 --> 01:17:49,526
We are gathered here today
to celebrate such a love.

1234
01:17:50,364 --> 01:17:53,697
Do you take each other,
for better or for worse?

1235
01:17:57,271 --> 01:17:58,465
For better, please.

1236
01:17:59,874 --> 01:18:02,365
What a beautiful, weird couple!

1237
01:18:02,710 --> 01:18:04,541
That's not going to last.

1238
01:18:05,713 --> 01:18:07,613
Can I kiss the bride?

1239
01:18:07,948 --> 01:18:09,540
No! Music!

1240
01:18:10,284 --> 01:18:11,376
- Struts.
- Check.

1241
01:18:11,719 --> 01:18:12,708
- Flaps!
- Check.

1242
01:18:12,953 --> 01:18:14,716
- Diamonds and gold.
- Check.

1243
01:18:17,224 --> 01:18:18,885
- Bye-bye!
- We'll miss you!

1244
01:18:18,959 --> 01:18:20,153
See you later!

1245
01:18:20,227 --> 01:18:23,162
We'll be back after the honeymoon
in Monte Carlo,

1246
01:18:23,230 --> 01:18:25,061
or whenever the gold runs out.

1247
01:18:25,299 --> 01:18:26,493
Come back soon!

1248
01:18:26,634 --> 01:18:31,662
Mom, let them take their time. New York
isn't going anywhere, right, guys?

1249
01:18:31,739 --> 01:18:33,764
You're right about that!

1250
01:18:33,841 --> 01:18:35,775
As long as I'm with her...

1251
01:18:35,843 --> 01:18:39,643
...and you two, I don't care
where we are.

1252
01:18:39,914 --> 01:18:42,405
She has the most amazing laugh.

1253
01:18:45,252 --> 01:18:47,584
Love has no boundaries!

1254
01:18:48,522 --> 01:18:50,854
Looks like you're stuck
with us for a while.

1255
01:18:53,928 --> 01:18:56,362
Dad? What's wrong?

1256
01:18:56,430 --> 01:18:59,092
I just thought we
could hang out a bit and...

1257
01:19:01,535 --> 01:19:03,662
- You got me!
- I got you, son!

1258
01:19:03,938 --> 01:19:07,339
You got me with my thing.
You brought it back around on me.

1259
01:19:10,277 --> 01:19:11,938
I got you, son!

1260
01:19:12,546 --> 01:19:14,878
The old man's not too bad, eh, Marty?

1261
01:19:14,949 --> 01:19:17,383
- Marty? Who's Marty?
- Come on.

1262
01:19:17,451 --> 01:19:20,716
- I don't know no Marty.
- You can't fool me.

1263
01:19:20,788 --> 01:19:22,983
Ain't no Marty here.

1264
01:19:23,057 --> 01:19:27,494
Marty! I can look into your eyes,
and I know it's you.

1265
01:19:27,561 --> 01:19:30,826
See, I've been traveling
Been traveling forever

1266
01:19:30,898 --> 01:19:34,163
But now that I found a home
feels like I'm in heaven

1267
01:19:34,234 --> 01:19:37,499
See, I've been traveling
Been traveling forever

1268
01:19:37,571 --> 01:19:39,402
But now that I'm home

1269
01:19:39,473 --> 01:19:43,136
Hey! Shake the hot things!
Shake the hot things!

1270
01:19:43,644 --> 01:19:46,807
Shake 'em! Shake 'em! Shake 'em!

1271
01:24:46,808 --> 01:24:47,809

1272
01:24:48,305 --> 01:24:54,769
