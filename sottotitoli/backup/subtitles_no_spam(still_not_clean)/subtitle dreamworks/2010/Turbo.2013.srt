1
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,679
And we're
back at the final stretch

2
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,489
of the Indianapolis 500.

3
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,564
Guy Gagné is
gaining on the pack.

4
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,331
The young French Canadian
is making quite an impression

5
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,687
in his debut
here at the Motor Speedway.

6
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,999
In all my years of racing,

7
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,844
I've never seen a driver
with this much raw talent.

8
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,079
But what's this?

9
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,686
Out of nowhere, a dark horse
is challenging Gagné.

10
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,080
He's gaining on the pack.

11
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,799
And down the front stretch.

12
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,804
Moving into fourth position.
Third. Now, second!

13
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,769
Going to the outside
as they cross the bricks!

14
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,764
And it looks like
the winner is Turbo!

15
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,163
Amazing! Unbelievable!

16
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,608
Instant replay.
Again, in super slo-mo.

17
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,441
Welcome back, race fans.

18
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,967
We're here with Indy's
brightest new star, Guy Gagné.

19
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,044
Tell us, Guy, what inspired
you to become a race driver?

20
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,240
You know, Dan, everybody's got that
one thing that makes them happy.

21
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,607
And for me, it's terrifying,
terrifying blazing speed.

22
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,959
Guy!

23
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,884
- One at a time, please.
- Theo!

24
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,963
Yes, the handsome
fellow in the back.

25
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,890
What are you doing?

26
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,771
What I've always done. Stay
focused, try to run my race.

27
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,127
That's all any driver can do.
Next question.

28
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,681
Can you please go to sleep?

29
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,285
We've got work tomorrow.

30
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,487
Sleep? Are you kidding me?

31
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,642
It takes hours to come down
after a big race like this.

32
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,529
Yeah, I bet. Okay.

33
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,569
They are the fuel
that keeps me running!

34
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,161
Guy, when you were just a rookie
starting out in the Indy Lights,

35
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,687
did you ever dream that you'd
be standing here today?

36
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,083
Well, as my dear father
always told me.

37
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:50,290
No dream is too big,
and no dreamer...

38
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,481
- Too small.
- Too small.

39
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,799
Sleep!

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,367
Head in the game.
Head in the game.

41
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,690
Yes! Seventeen minutes!
That's a new record!

42
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,445
Theo!

43
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,121
Good morning.

44
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,650
Let's go, people!
Pick it up!

45
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,806
Turbo, ready to make his move.

46
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,999
Did you see that?
She cut me off!

47
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,004
Ah! The joys of racing.

48
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,845
How could anyone not see the appeal
of watching a bunch of cars,

49
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,526
drive around in circles
for hours on end?

50
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,688
Left turn!
Left turn! Left turn!

51
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,683
Your ignorance
saddens me to no end.

52
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,359
Left turn!
What do I do here?

53
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,203
Oh, no, wait a minute.
Left turn!

54
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,681
Morning, Chet!

55
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,841
How's it going, Sally?

56
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,639
- Morning, Chet.
- Morning, Phil.

57
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,564
Well, that's a shame.

58
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:28,807
And so begins another wonderful
work week at the plant.

59
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,727
All right, people, we got a lot
of tomatoes to harvest today.

60
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,163
We got to pick them, we got to
sort them, we got to eat them.

61
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,164
But most importantly,
we got to be...

62
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,321
Safe.

63
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,051
Yes! Music to my ears.

64
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,164
Look at her.

65
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,599
Nice curves.

66
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:57,208
Oh! You are one giant,
juicy temptress.

67
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,041
Big Red.

68
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,489
Any day now.

69
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,570
Any day now.

70
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,686
Overripe!

71
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,251
Overripe!

72
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,806
Overripe!

73
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,359
Oh, no.

74
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,246
Here we go.

75
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,246
Bring it on.

76
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,962
Not this time.

77
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,399
And the cars are
at the starting line.

78
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,970
Gagné's in
the top pole position,

79
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,561
driving his trademark
number one overripe tomato.

80
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,087
Next to him is that feisty
young upstart, Turbo.

81
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,403
Gentlemen, start your engines.

82
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,445
Gagné rolls into the lead
around the first turn

83
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,001
with Turbo hot on his tail
into the straightaway.

84
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,083
Hey, there he goes again.

85
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,239
And down the homestretch,
the crowd goes wild!

86
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,359
Go, Turbo!

87
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,443
They're neck and neck!
Gagné, Turbo! Turbo, Gagné!

88
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,042
- And it looks like the winner is...
- Turbo!

89
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,919
Oh! So close!

90
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,281
It's a photo finish!

91
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,639
Overripe!

92
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,207
All right, all right,
knock it off.

93
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,890
Talk to your brother, Chet.
Or I will.

94
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,166
I'm on it, Carl.

95
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,924
This will not happen again.

96
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,929
Heard that before.

97
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,519
Okay.

98
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,565
That's lunch!

99
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,167
You do this to yourself,
you know.

100
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,730
I mean, look at you.

101
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,402
How could they
not make fun of you?

102
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,722
It's like you're
almost forcing them.

103
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,763
If you'd just quit it
with the speed stuff...

104
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,126
I can't help it.

105
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,721
It's in me.

106
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,291
Mmm, no.
It is not in you.

107
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,519
Says who?

108
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,399
Nature. Mother Nature.

109
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,447
Maybe you've heard of her?

110
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,729
We all have
our limitations, Theo.

111
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,359
And the sooner
you accept the dull,

112
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,931
miserable reality
of your existence,

113
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,282
the happier you'll be.

114
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:38,441
Aren't you just a
little ray of sunshine?

115
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,564
Heads up! Shell
crusher, two o' clock!

116
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,442
All right, people,
you know the drill.

117
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,090
Tuck and roll!

118
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,531
Can't tuck.
I can't tuck!

119
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,569
Theo, tuck and roll!

120
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,519
We've been over this.
I don't tuck and roll.

121
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,000
You have a shell
for a reason. Use it.

122
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,491
You use it.

123
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,563
I mean, come on, he's not
even looking this way.

124
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,001
Hey, Juice Box, nice tricycle!

125
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,241
You see what I'm saying?

126
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,171
All right, good hustle.

127
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,288
Good hustle, everybody!

128
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,528
Almost everybody.

129
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,607
Quitting time!

130
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,761
Good night, Jim!
Night, Sally!

131
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,399
Night, Steve!
I don't know your name.

132
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,050
I'm out of here! Bye!

133
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,245
You're watching Fast!

134
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,205
Sponsored by Adrenalode!

135
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,885
Adrenalode, not legal
in Utah and South Dakota.

136
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,199
Do not exceed more than two cans
of Adrenalode in a 24-hour period.

137
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,559
Do not expose Adrenalode to
flame, or to water, or to sand.

138
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,686
Yes!

139
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,441
That tastes awesome.

140
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,481
Welcome back to
The Road to Indianapolis.

141
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:57,122
I'm here with five-time Indy
champ, the legendary Guy Gagné!

142
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,399
I love you, Guy!

143
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,639
Tell us, Guy, do you have any advice
for the future racers out there

144
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,919
who might be watching
at home right now?

145
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,410
Oh, my gosh.
That's me, that's me.

146
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,001
Well, there comes a time
in every race

147
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,722
when a driver is forced to make that
one, key, split-second decision.

148
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,159
Fall behind, or push ahead.

149
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,321
Push ahead!

150
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,239
To take a chance
and risk it all,

151
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,846
or play it safe
and suffer defeat.

152
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,206
Risk it all, Guy!

153
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,886
But what really separates the
racers from the champions...

154
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,047
Yes!

155
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,999
That one thing
that separates

156
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,923
the ordinary from
the extraordinary...

157
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,286
What is it?

158
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,371
That one thing is...

159
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,367
No!

160
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,247
No, you didn't!

161
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,488
No! No! No! No! No!

162
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,959
Come back to me, TV!

163
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,007
- Only you have your finger on the...
- It's working!

164
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,399
- Morning, Bob.
- Morning, Sally.

165
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,481
Morning, Steve.

166
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,721
Morning...

167
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,249
You know, this is good.

168
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,481
Yes, this is good.

169
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,001
I daresay we've had
a breakthrough here.

170
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,767
With that TV gone, you can
finally get out of that garage

171
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,402
and put all that racing
nonsense behind you.

172
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,721
And do what?

173
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,484
Start living your life.

174
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,879
I have a life?

175
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,321
Big Red?

176
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,726
Big Red!

177
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,530
I can't tuck.
I can't tuck!

178
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,931
- Yes!
- Finally!

179
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,079
All right, let's chow down!

180
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,606
Hit the brakes, people.

181
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,444
It's Gardener Day.

182
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,202
You're quitting?
Just like that?

183
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,364
Hey, nothing ventured,
nothing gained.

184
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,801
That's a bad thing.

185
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,079
There comes a time
in every race

186
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,159
when a driver is forced
to make

187
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,811
that one, key,
split-second decision.

188
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,286
What did he just say?

189
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,599
Take a chance and risk it all,

190
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,080
or play it safe
and suffer defeat.

191
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,881
Okay, enough
with the crazy talk, Theo.

192
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,964
Just step away from the
grass and get back to work.

193
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,201
Theo!

194
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,323
And the cars are
at the starting line.

195
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,961
Gentlemen, start your engines.

196
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,201
And once again,
it's Turbo out front.

197
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,687
No dream is too big.

198
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,728
In the high lane!
At the stripe!

199
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,882
And it looks like
the winner is...

200
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,851
Tuck and roll, Theo!
Tuck and roll!

201
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,527
No!

202
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,125
Are you insane?

203
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,004
You could've
gotten yourself killed!

204
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,924
Theo, what were you thinking?

205
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,723
I thought I could get there.

206
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,643
When are you gonna wake up?

207
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,605
I wish...

208
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,639
I wish I was...

209
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,839
That was close.

210
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,247
Oh, no.

211
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,724
Yeah!

212
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,441
No, no, no!
Come on! Faster!

213
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,730
No, no, no!

214
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,407
What happened?

215
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,169
Hey, hey, hey!
Get out of here!

216
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,971
Not dead! Not dead!

217
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,808
It reeks in here.

218
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,521
It's like wearing a hat
made out of feet.

219
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,330
Home.

220
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,845
All right.

221
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,600
I'm okay.

222
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,410
That's peculiar.

223
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,439
Okay, what's happening to me?

224
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,284
Oh! What? That's me!

225
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,719
Oh, come on! Stop it!

226
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,405
Quiet, quiet!

227
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:39,087
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

228
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,719
Welcome, everyone, to this
monthly safety meeting.

229
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,011
Well, there goes Jerry.

230
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,762
I'm going to hand things
over to Chet, now,

231
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:58,129
who has some important
new policies to go over.

232
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,802
Thank you very much, Carl.
Good afternoon, everyone.

233
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:06,879
I'm happy to "poli-see"
you all here today.

234
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:13,848
Okay. I would like to begin
with some very exciting news.

235
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,411
The latest figures are in.

236
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,803
Accidental smushes
were down 15 percent.

237
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,159
Well done, team.

238
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,399
<i>It's tricky to rock a rhyme</i>

239
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,399
<i>To rock a rhyme
that's right, on time</i>

240
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:31,079
<i>It's tricky,
tricky, tricky</i>

241
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,319
Yo, yo!
You're listening to 98.6

242
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,130
where hip-hop beats.

243
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,076
<i>What's new pussycat?</i>

244
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,365
<i>Drop it like it's hot</i>

245
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,954
<i>Drop it like it's hot</i>

246
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,726
Finally.

247
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,609
What in the...

248
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,286
Help!

249
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,161
Stop! Stop, stop!

250
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,609
Mom!

251
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,924
Yeah!

252
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,879
Oh, no!

253
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,119
And so, in preparation
for Crow Awareness Week,

254
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,249
I'd just like to say...

255
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,559
Tuck and roll!

256
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,679
No, I'm not kidding!
Tuck and roll!

257
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,321
Look out!

258
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,246
Granted, yes,

259
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:03,043
I admit that there's been a wee
bit of damage to inventory, here,

260
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,611
but if you'd just
let me explain...

261
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,926
You're fired!

262
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,323
Whoa, okay, Carl, if you just
give him one more chance,

263
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,767
I promise that this
will never, ever...

264
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,730
You don't understand.
You're fired.

265
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,761
You, plural. Youse.
Y'all. Both of you!

266
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,683
Chet. I'm so sorry.

267
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,444
You have to believe me,
I didn't mean for this to...

268
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,887
All my life.

269
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,286
All my life, I've defended
you, covered for you,

270
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,279
stood up for you,
apologized for you,

271
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,442
and this is what
I get in return.

272
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,604
Dragged down with you
on your sinking ship.

273
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:53,407
A nice, comfy deck chair
on the S.S. Theo!

274
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,279
Ave-aye, Captain!

275
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,359
I'm really sorry.

276
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,124
What is wrong with you?

277
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,487
I don't know.
All I know is, the other night,

278
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,881
I'm standing above the 101,
and all of a sudden...

279
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,999
It was a rhetorical question!

280
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,167
Chet!

281
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,965
Help! The world is moving!

282
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,647
Coming through!

283
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,761
Okay, I'm gonna
wake up any minute now.

284
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,160
Wake up! Wake up!

285
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,365
Chet?

286
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:09,444
Easy now, fellas. You
really don't wanna do this.

287
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,166
Chet!

288
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:45,927
Am I dead?
Is this heaven?

289
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,242
I pictured it cleaner.

290
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,731
Come on, get up.

291
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,925
Theo. Whoa.
The crows got you too.

292
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,319
What? No, Chet, it wasn't the crows.
It was...

293
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,405
Look at this place.

294
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,365
- Broken glass, rusty nails.
- Breathe.

295
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,801
- Discarded salt packets!
- A few, yeah.

296
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,167
It's like a minefield out here.

297
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:12,325
Oh, no. I've got tetanus.
I've got tetanus.

298
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,051
My jaw is locking up.

299
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:19,440
Chet, will you calm down?
There is no reason to panic.

300
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,439
Everything's
gonna be just fine.

301
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:29,003
Well, well, well. Buenas noches,
little amigos.

302
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,807
This must be my lucky day.

303
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,286
Hola. It's Tito.

304
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,159
Hey, tell everyone
I'm bringing it.

305
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,170
What is this place?

306
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,607
Well, well, well.

307
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,239
Somebody better call the cops,

308
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,447
because I'm about to
make a killing.

309
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,801
Killing?

310
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,361
What'd he drag in this time?

311
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:36,130
Ha! Whiplash is
going to eat them up.

312
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,601
It's gonna be a slaughter.

313
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,679
Dead meat.

314
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,530
We're gonna die.
We're gonna die.

315
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,920
Come on, come on.
Now, hurry up.

316
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,367
A little far from home
aren't you, garden snail?

317
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:05,166
Hey, I think
we got a crier here.

318
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,285
Let's do this!

319
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,759
- I got this one!
- Oh, I got this one!

320
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,841
Yeah. Yeah, yeah!

321
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,961
Come on! This is me!

322
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,849
Time to go, Theo.

323
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,721
Ready...

324
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,439
Set...

325
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,639
Go!

326
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,685
Look. He dead.

327
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,564
Taco Man found dead snail.

328
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,367
What?

329
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,486
Run!

330
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,324
Santa Maria!

331
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,444
What did you say
your name was again?

332
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,331
My name is Turbo.

333
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,599
I wish I could
rename myself.

334
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,759
Where did you find him?

335
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,799
How did he do that?

336
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,879
Where did you come from?

337
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,689
Hey, how'd you do that?

338
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,251
Theo. A word, please.

339
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,224
Okay, that was...

340
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,761
Amazing, right?

341
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,719
If you think that's something,
check this out.

342
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,039
Turn it off!

343
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,361
Sorry. High beams. Sorry.

344
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,159
Ooh, that's a new one.

345
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,323
It's okay, it's okay, Theo.
Just hang in there.

346
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,847
As soon as we get home,
we're gonna get you fixed.

347
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,168
What? I don't need to be fixed.

348
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,367
There's nothing
wrong with me, Chet.

349
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:02,127
Nothing wrong with you?
Well, you're...

350
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,611
You're a freak of nature.

351
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,564
I know, I know!
Isn't it great?

352
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,719
Theo!

353
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,688
You know what?
I prefer Turbo.

354
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,771
I don't know what crazy
lab you escaped from

355
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:16,561
but you're amazing,
Little Amigo. Amazing!

356
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,839
Tito!

357
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,964
One second, please.

358
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,090
Do you see that sign?
What does it say?

359
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,559
Angelo...

360
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,961
It says,
Dos Bros Tacos.

361
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,845
Dos Bros, Tito.
Not Uno Bro.

362
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,651
You're supposed to be out
there, selling tacos,

363
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,086
not racing snails.

364
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,686
I know, but this little
guy is something special.

365
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,086
I'm telling you, Angelo,

366
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:42,130
the customers are gonna be
lining up around the block.

367
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,884
I can see it already.

368
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:48,967
Come for the snail racing, stay
for the chimichangas. Huh?

369
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,359
Get your head out
of the clouds, Tito.

370
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,931
It's enough with
your crazy schemes.

371
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,526
No! You're a taco
genius, Angelo.

372
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:02,242
And it is my mission in life to
share your gift with the world.

373
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,042
Great. Then first
thing in the morning,

374
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:09,529
get in that truck
and go sell some tacos.

375
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,404
Tito.

376
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,246
You sure you had enough to eat?
Are you tired?

377
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,563
Here, I made up your bed.

378
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,563
Now, it might get
a little chilly tonight.

379
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,171
So, I warmed up your blanket.

380
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,326
There you go.
All comfy and cozy.

381
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:41,285
Sweet dreams, Little Amigo.
I'll see you in the morning.

382
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,571
Did he really just
kiss you goodnight?

383
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,643
He did. Jealous?

384
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,122
Question. What gives
with the super-speed?

385
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,645
Hey, hey, you a robot?

386
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,006
Are you radioactive, homie?

387
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,319
Is it contagious?

388
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,448
Give the kid some space.

389
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,082
I'm Whiplash and
this here is my crew.

390
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,811
I'm Skidmark!

391
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,083
Yeah!

392
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:14,722
And I'm Burn.
Sizzle, sizzle, uh-uh.

393
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,850
The name is Smoove Move. I set
the tone around here, you dig?

394
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,411
Now check this.
Right about now,

395
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:23,759
I'm moving so fast, the whole
world's going in slow motion, baby.

396
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,041
Here one second, gone the next.

397
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,288
They call me the White Shadow!

398
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:34,240
Because I'm so fast,
all you see is my shadow.

399
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,161
I don't get it.

400
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,007
I'm fast, like a shadow!

401
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,604
Yeah, but shadows,
they're not inherently fast.

402
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,481
White Shadow...

403
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,687
I can still see you.

404
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,639
Listen, garden snail,
you clearly

405
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,529
got the skills
to pay the bills.

406
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,281
If snails had to
pay bills, that is.

407
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,965
You would be able to pay them.

408
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,610
Yeah, bills.

409
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,171
Paid in full, son.

410
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:02,039
So, I'm here to invite
you to join our crew.

411
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,686
Join your crew?

412
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,607
Did I say something humorous?

413
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,650
I'm sorry. It's just that
you guys are, you know,

414
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,239
kind of slow-ish.

415
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,163
Oh! Really? To our faces?

416
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,163
Theo, what are you doing?

417
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:21,882
Now, I'm gonna pretend I didn't
hear what I clearly just heard.

418
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,401
Heard what?
I didn't hear anything.

419
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,289
Nothing out of order,
did you, Theo?

420
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,519
Oh, I meant what I said.

421
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,919
Then you better put your
money where your mouth is.

422
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,285
Snails don't have money.

423
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,284
Otherwise, we'd be able to
pay the bills. Remember?

424
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,602
Your trash talk is
needlessly complicated.

425
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:41,288
Is it? Or is it that your
unpaid bills are overdue?

426
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:45,485
Enough talk.
It's time for action.

427
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:50,490
It's simple. First one to the
top of that shooting star

428
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,730
wins.

429
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,043
You guys? Way up there, huh?
Awesome.

430
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,239
Let me get my calendar
so I can time you.

431
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,049
Oh, you got jokes, rookie?

432
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,407
Laugh it up, garden snail.

433
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,039
On your mark...

434
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,004
Get yourself set...

435
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:10,369
Prepare to be White Shadowed!

436
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,921
Yeah!

437
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,605
Yeah! Bam!

438
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,079
Coming through!

439
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,764
Oh! Those guys
are crazy!

440
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,684
Those guys are awesome.

441
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,006
Hey, player!
The party up here!

442
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,761
How do I get up there?

443
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,886
Later!

444
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,921
Coming through!

445
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,921
Yeah!

446
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:18,967
Who's slow-ish now, garden snail?

447
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,284
Today, everything changes!

448
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,961
Tito, what are you doing?

449
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,009
Planning a taco-volution!

450
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:36,846
It's a little concept that I came up with.
When you combine the words...

451
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,765
Taco and revolution.
I get it.

452
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,491
But how is that supposed
to help us sell tacos?

453
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:47,079
Patience, bro. Taco-volutions
don't happen in a day.

454
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,199
<i>Tacos, I say</i>

455
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,919
<i>Talking about a taco-volution</i>

456
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,888
<i>Sauce and chips...</i>

457
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,759
And next up
on our tour is the L.A. River.

458
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,610
Famous for its appearance...

459
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,928
Get! Get out!

460
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,845
Sorry, Paz. Can
you throw that up here?

461
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,487
Coming to getcha!
I'm coming to getcha!

462
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,681
Bye.

463
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,719
Hey!

464
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:26,371
Valley Hobby, this is
Bobby, how can I help you?

465
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,727
No, you got the wrong number.
Yeah, okay.

466
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,362
That's what I'm talking about!

467
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,882
You want Jackson Five on your feet?
One Jackson per toe.

468
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,884
Sure, knock yourself out.

469
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,321
Can't get no better.

470
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,923
Okay. So,
what's your plan, huh?

471
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:34,249
Stay here in this
rundown strip mall?

472
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,762
With a bunch of lunatic snails,

473
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,602
and a nutso taco man who is
using you to sell Mexican food?

474
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:46,283
Because if that's your plan, then
whoopty-skippy-do, sign me up!

475
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:50,889
My ears are burning. I hope
you're not talking about me.

476
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:54,450
You two seem to have a special
connection, Little Amigo,

477
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:58,491
and Snail Who Seems To Be
Friends With Little Amigo.

478
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,839
Is this your mother?

479
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,127
Your sister?

480
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,964
Oh! Say no more.
It's your girlfriend.

481
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,128
Ah, she's a cutie.

482
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,319
Women.

483
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,170
I have to admit,

484
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:26,767
I was kind of hoping the taco-volution
would've started by now.

485
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,125
It doesn't make sense.

486
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,760
With my brains and your speed,

487
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,924
we should be destined
for greatness, right?

488
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,962
We need to think big,
Little Amigo.

489
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:47,205
I'm talking commercials,
talk shows, county fairs.

490
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:51,364
Flea markets. No, farmers' markets.
No, supermarkets.

491
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,443
We'll cover all the markets.

492
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,844
Quinceañeras,
confirmations, graduations.

493
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,367
The Indy 500.

494
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,407
Ooh, I got it. We can have
our very own telenovela!

495
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,164
What? No.

496
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,924
This is it, Chet. I knew we
ended up here for a reason.

497
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,969
Will you just
slow down for a second?

498
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,240
Slow down? Are you kidding?
I'm never going slow again!

499
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,004
Theo, stop.

500
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,529
What are you trying to say?

501
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,081
I wanna enter him
in the Indy 500.

502
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,891
The Indy 500?
What are you talking about?

503
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,280
What is he talking about?

504
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,046
Now, look, I know it may
sound a little crazy...

505
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,771
No, no, no, Tito,
that doesn't sound crazy.

506
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,521
Dos Bros Tacos and Sushi.
That was crazy.

507
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,324
What? People love sushi.

508
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:59,281
Dos Bros Tacos and Monkey Petting Zoo.
That was crazy.

509
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,847
The babies were cute.
The adults were just so mean.

510
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,561
Taco Man and his sidekick,
the Churro.

511
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,959
Oh, that was
off-the-hook crazy!

512
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,530
Crazy awesome.

513
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:14,607
But this, Tito? This is in
a category all by itself.

514
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,921
Angelo, please.

515
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,122
Come on, Chet.
Just hear me out.

516
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:22,080
Theo, a snail cannot race in a
competition meant for cars.

517
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,685
There are rules.

518
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,644
Actually, I've been doing
a lot of research,

519
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,439
and there's
nothing in the rules

520
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,960
that says a snail
can't enter the race.

521
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,731
There's nothing that says this
sponge can't enter the race either,

522
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,201
but that doesn't mean
it's ever gonna happen.

523
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,567
Millions of people watch
that race.

524
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,370
This could put us
on the map, bro.

525
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,959
Trying to work here.

526
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,291
Oh, come on, Angelo.

527
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,959
All we have to do is raise the
$20,000 registration fee.

528
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,079
What?

529
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,048
- I figured, once we sell the truck...
- Sell the...

530
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,521
Are you even listening
to yourself, Tito?

531
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:54,846
You want to invest our entire
life savings in a snail!

532
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,482
I'm telling you, this snail crawled
into our lives for a reason.

533
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,210
I think he could be
our little shooting star.

534
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,522
Did you hear that, Chet?
This guy believes in me.

535
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,682
That guy is as
crazy as you are.

536
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,450
They'll never let
you into that race.

537
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,126
And even if they did,
you wouldn't survive one lap.

538
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,691
- Yeah, but...
- Angelo, listen...

539
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,841
- Tito!
- Theo!

540
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,606
Not every dream is
meant to come true.

541
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,604
Yeah, what he said.

542
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:25,089
A snail in the Indy 500.

543
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,446
What will you think of next?

544
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:39,439
Don't worry, Little Amigo.
We'll get that entrance fee somehow.

545
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,279
Now, I know some people may say

546
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,408
$20,000 sounds
like a lot of money.

547
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,721
It is a lot of money.

548
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,089
And I know some people
may say I'm crazy.

549
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:00,643
But I say, when a snail crawls into
your life at 200 miles an hour,

550
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,406
then you'd have to be crazy
not to grab onto that shell,

551
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,523
and take a ride of a lifetime.

552
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,928
Now, in case you're
still not convinced...

553
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:12,129
Boom! Check out my well-designed
endorsement poster.

554
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:18,010
<i>We are the champions,
my friends...</i>

555
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,204
What's your point, Tito?

556
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,961
My point is, we got a chance to
change our lives for the better.

557
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:31,205
To make Starlight Plaza the great
place we all know it could be.

558
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,407
Now, come on.

559
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:37,009
Who's ready to sponsor
the next Indy 500 champion?

560
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,170
Sorry, Tito, but
I've got work to do.

561
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,123
No, you don't.
None of you do.

562
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,847
I don't get it.
That poster was awesome.

563
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:57,080
Oh, well, good try, you did your best.
Time to go home, Theo.

564
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:00,370
Oh, we're going
to Indianapolis, Chet.

565
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:03,444
Don't you worry your chubby
little face about that.

566
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,606
All right, team.

567
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,009
Snail up!

568
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,051
And next up
on our tour is the L.A. River.

569
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,999
Famous for its appearance
in such movies as...

570
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,959
You've just been
White Shadowed!

571
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,279
Next stop is
the Starlight Plaza.

572
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,641
Yes!

573
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,282
Burn. Let's get
this party started.

574
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,771
You know it.

575
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,047
Snailed it.

576
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,924
Skidmark. You bringing
the beverages?

577
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,687
Oh, I got a beverage for you.
And a beverage for you.

578
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:56,644
Light her up, Turbo.
Do your thing, baby.

579
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:06,050
Hey, Angelo!
We got customers.

580
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,730
Okay, you ready?

581
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,159
Go!

582
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:29,124
All right.
You're good to go.

583
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,521
Okay, everybody.
Back on the bus.

584
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,643
Oh, Mama, you look good!

585
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:36,810
Bye. Come again. I do
weddings, bar mitzvahs.

586
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,405
Thank you.
Come back soon.

587
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,722
Tomorrow, later on today.
I'll be here.

588
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,530
Good luck with
that snail of yours.

589
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,165
Thank you, my friend.

590
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,845
I gotta hand it to you, Tito.

591
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,731
For once, one of your
crazy schemes worked.

592
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:49,959
I know!

593
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,327
And, hey, if we did better
because of that billboard,

594
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,966
just imagine what
the Indy 500 could do.

595
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:57,327
Hey, don't go crazy on me.

596
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:00,927
We had a good day.
We sold a few extra tacos.

597
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,321
It's good enough.

598
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:23,006
You better not mess
this up, Tito.

599
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,681
Oh, no.

600
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:29,923
Oh, yes. We're going to
Indianapolis, Chet!

601
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:34,639
I to the N to the Dizzy
to the Wizzah. You dig?

602
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,085
Yes, sir.

603
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,924
One breakfast burrito, please.

604
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:48,481
That's it. I'm sorry, honey.
Today is the day.

605
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,124
Tito!

606
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,001
Are you ready, big man?

607
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,766
On three. One, two...

608
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,645
Indy, baby!

609
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,767
I got it! Fasty!

610
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:32,331
Are you kidding me?

611
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,171
Turbo!

612
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:45,446
All right, as the kids say,
time to plump your ride.

613
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,683
Oh, heck, no!

614
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,484
Let's do this.

615
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,921
Now, that's more like it.

616
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,879
No twitching. Voilà!

617
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:12,244
Suited and booted, gooted and
looted, dipped and whipped!

618
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,607
We've got a contender, baby!

619
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,887
Oh, look at him go!

620
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:40,881
Fresh air, baby.

621
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,439
We ain't in Van Nuys no more.

622
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:55,767
Hi, Chet.

623
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:57,805
You're gonna be my boyfriend!

624
00:46:58,360 --> 00:46:59,646
I'm gonna
call you boo.

625
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,371
Boo? What does
that even mean?

626
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,599
Sure beats the view
from the garden, huh?

627
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,207
I can't believe
you're doing this.

628
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:15,886
We. We are doing this.

629
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:18,566
You. I'm just a hostage.

630
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:23,639
Theo, what happens
if you wake up tomorrow,

631
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:26,325
and your powers are gone, hmm?

632
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:29,367
What then?

633
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,571
Then I better make
the most of today.

634
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,571
This is even bigger
than Hobby-Con.

635
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:26,726
Now, that's a car.

636
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,526
Shiny.

637
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:57,841
Gagné.

638
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,122
And Guy Gagné wins the pole,

639
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:27,410
with a four-lap average
of 230 miles per hour.

640
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,762
That's Gagné's best time yet.

641
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:32,003
Turbo has never gone that fast.

642
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,491
I mean, yet.

643
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:37,247
So, you got a plan, Taco Man?

644
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:39,368
Of course I do.

645
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:43,843
Please tell me those phony
glasses are not your plan.

646
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:47,527
Uh, no.
That would be ridiculous.

647
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:50,087
Come on, phony
glasses, do your thing.

648
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:56,964
Oh, this great. I'm gonna
go have heart attack.

649
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:07,210
Qué pasa, my friend?

650
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:11,043
I have a driver that I'd
like to enter into the race.

651
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,123
What team does
your driver race for?

652
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,926
Dos Bros Tacos and Company.

653
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:19,769
Has he passed the rookie test?

654
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:24,490
Hey, come here. Let's
cut to the chase, okay?

655
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:27,371
You have glasses,
I have glasses.

656
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,602
What do we gotta do
to get this done, bro?

657
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,366
Hey, let go.
Come on, man, let go!

658
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:36,320
This is no way to treat a guy with glasses.
I have astigmatism and stuff.

659
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,479
Yeah, yeah.

660
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,439
Guy, how do you do it,

661
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:46,959
shattering your own
records year after year?

662
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,681
Well, when a cheetah
chases after a gazelle,

663
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:54,208
does he ever stop to think, maybe
I've caught enough gazelles.

664
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,324
Maybe I should just settle
down, try the vegan thing.

665
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:00,723
No! He keeps running as long
as his legs will carry him.

666
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,407
I am like the cheetah.
I never give up.

667
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:06,559
Next question.

668
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:12,000
All right, give me the keys.
I'll drive the first shift home.

669
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:13,926
What gives?

670
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:20,720
No, no, no!

671
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:25,883
Can I help you, monsieur?

672
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:28,244
One second, please.

673
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,641
What are you doing? Are you
trying to get me arrested?

674
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:39,768
Sorry! So sorry. We'll
have this under control...

675
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,604
Ladies and gentlemen!

676
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:46,402
I give you the next
Indy 500 champion!

677
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,770
Is that a snail?

678
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,447
Your driver is a snail?

679
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:04,283
What kind of welcome is that?

680
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:07,649
I'd say an appropriate
welcome, given the situation.

681
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,245
All right.
Game over, nut job.

682
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,599
Let's go.

683
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:12,568
Have a nice flight, Chet.

684
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,290
- Hit it!
- White Shadow!

685
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:17,011
Bonzai!

686
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:18,919
Get off!

687
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:20,160
Pedal to the metal, Turbo.

688
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:22,961
Go!

689
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:41,641
Yeah!

690
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,766
That snail is fast!

691
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:10,169
What did I miss?
What did I miss?

692
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:18,766
226! That's fast enough
to qualify!

693
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:25,687
That's what I'm talking about!

694
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:32,319
That snail is fast!

695
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:35,290
Oh, man, wait until
people see this!

696
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:43,488
- That snail is fast!
- What? Are you seeing this?

697
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:47,568
- Hello?
- Have you heard?

698
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:49,165
Yes, I've heard.

699
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:50,890
That snail is fast.

700
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:53,731
Forget about it. This
will blow over by noon.

701
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:56,359
That snail is fast!

702
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,126
- Hello?
- Have you seen it?

703
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,169
Yes, I've seen it!

704
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,127
That snail is fast!

705
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:08,361
What?

706
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:11,162
Snail is fast!

707
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:12,799
<i>You see the snail moving fast</i>

708
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,165
<i>You slow, you gonna get passed</i>

709
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:16,004
<i>You see him
gaining position for first</i>

710
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:17,161
<i>He won't be last</i>

711
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:18,845
<i>He's ready to make a dash</i>

712
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,604
<i>Snail quicker
than a lightning flash</i>

713
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:22,199
<i>His engine's roaring,
he's flooring</i>

714
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,599
<i>He won't run out of gas</i>

715
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:26,330
<i>That snail is fast!</i>

716
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:29,370
<i>That snail is fast,
fast, fast, fast, fast</i>

717
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:32,687
Are you seeing this?

718
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:36,281
You cannot have
a snail in the Indy 500.

719
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,329
It's a miracle of nature!

720
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,801
Will the snail
be crushed by the giant race cars?

721
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:45,832
<i>That snail is fast,
fast, fast, fast, fast</i>

722
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,530
That snail is fast.

723
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,079
We've just received
word that the CEO

724
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:59,003
of IndyCar is about
to make a statement.

725
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:10,010
And so, after careful
consideration and...

726
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,750
<i>That snail is fast</i>

727
00:55:11,751 --> 00:55:13,235
<i>That snail is fast</i>

728
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:15,044
Sorry. My bad.

729
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:18,605
I've decided...

730
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:20,091
Please, say yes.
Please, say yes.

731
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:21,651
Please, say no.
Please, say no.

732
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:23,689
White Shadow.

733
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:29,489
I've decided that I simply cannot
permit a snail to enter...

734
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:32,079
Please, sir,
give my snail a shot,

735
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:34,321
and I swear,
you won't regret it.

736
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:39,568
Mr. Lopez, while I appreciate your
enthusiasm, my decision is...

737
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:41,085
Let him race!

738
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:42,605
Let him race!

739
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,000
Let him race!

740
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:47,289
Let him race! Let him race!
Let him race!

741
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,966
Now, now. Order.

742
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:53,571
Sir, if I may.

743
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:55,927
You might want to
get a two-shot here.

744
00:55:56,120 --> 00:56:01,729
I, like this passionate gentleman
here, came from humble beginnings.

745
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:04,730
In the words of my dear father.

746
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:10,370
No dream is too big,
and no dreamer, too small.

747
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,889
And that is why I, for one,

748
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:17,364
believe that if the Indy 500 isn't
going to put a limit on speed,

749
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:21,121
then it shouldn't
put a limit on spirit!

750
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:24,248
Give the people what they want.

751
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:26,010
Let him race!

752
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:30,768
Let him race! Let him race!
Let him race!

753
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:32,251
Just me.

754
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,051
Whole frame, my face.

755
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:38,766
All right!

756
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:42,763
All right, what?

757
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:47,291
Your snail can compete
in the Indianapolis 500.

758
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:50,481
Yeah!

759
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:54,043
Has the world lost its mind?

760
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:04,999
To Turbo!

761
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,082
Starlight Plaza! Hey!

762
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:08,605
He ain't slow no more.

763
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:09,839
That's for sure.

764
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:10,959
Shut the door.

765
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,724
Get on the floor.

766
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:14,723
Barbeque sauce!

767
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:17,804
And we're back
with more from Indianapolis.

768
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:19,689
Check it out.
We're on TV.

769
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,519
Mr. Lopez,
how do you feel about

770
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,090
getting to compete
in the Indy 500?

771
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:25,322
I'm just so happy.

772
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:27,399
And we'd all be
happy to see you

773
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:29,243
come on down to
the Starlight Plaza.

774
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:32,449
Just north of the 101
in Van Nuys, California.

775
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:36,366
Kim Ly Nail Salon. Where we
put the nail in snail.

776
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:40,603
Taco Man cried in front of
millions of people.

777
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:04,648
Here you go, Paz.
Nice and warm.

778
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:05,847
Goodnight, Tito.

779
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:07,644
- You comfy enough, Bobby?
- Uh... No.

780
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:09,325
Okay, let me know
if you need anything.

781
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:11,403
Hey! No touching!

782
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:16,003
Smooth, smooth, smooth.

783
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:21,323
Sleep tight, Little Amigo.
We got a big day tomorrow.

784
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,290
Yep.

785
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:27,242
Big day, indeed.

786
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:30,443
Hmm, I'm detecting a refreshing
note of disapproval.

787
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:33,649
I'm worried.
And you should be too.

788
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,079
I'll be fine.

789
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:38,439
You are delusional,
you know that?

790
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:41,125
It's Big Red all over again.

791
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,967
Only this time, instead
of one lawn mower,

792
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:48,609
it'll be 32 giant,
fire-breathing cars!

793
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:51,489
And I won't be
able to save you.

794
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:55,008
You won't have to, because
this time, I have speed.

795
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:58,289
You're not a car.
You're a snail.

796
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:03,010
I got a shot here, Chet.
I can do this. You'll see.

797
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:04,571
No, I won't.

798
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:08,885
I will not stand by and watch
the only brother I've got

799
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:13,364
risk his life chasing
some impossible dream.

800
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:15,689
I'm sorry, Theo.

801
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:21,800
All of these people,
they believe in me.

802
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:25,603
Guy Gagne believes in me.

803
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:28,248
Why won't you?

804
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:32,166
And by the way,
my name is Turbo.

805
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:02,407
All right.
Tout suite, let's go.

806
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,484
2.2-liter turbo V6.

807
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:20,611
24-valve
quad-overhead cam.

808
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:24,399
Fastest open-wheel, single-seat
machine on the planet.

809
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:27,210
I think I'm in love.

810
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:30,724
No way.

811
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:42,410
You're not trying to steal
my trophy from me, are you?

812
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:49,610
Because if you want one for
yourself, you may have a long wait.

813
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:50,841
Espresso?

814
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:56,044
So, you are my
little competition, eh?

815
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:58,567
The underdog
versus the champion.

816
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:01,803
The world loves the
underdogs, you know.

817
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:04,850
The dreamers out there,
they need them.

818
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,399
Need to believe
that one day, maybe

819
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:09,687
they could achieve
the impossible too.

820
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:17,008
Well, the sad truth is,
underdogs seldom win.

821
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:19,925
And dreamers?

822
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:23,129
Let's just say, eventually,
they have to wake up.

823
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:31,331
I've never talked to a snail before.
So small, so amusing.

824
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:33,801
No wonder they want
to see you race, eh?

825
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:38,523
Look at him go.

826
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:40,489
Thank you, plucky snail.

827
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:45,487
Because of you, the whole world
will be watching this race.

828
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:50,891
And when the checkered flag drops,
they'll be watching me win.

829
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:57,761
Crawl home, garden snail,

830
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,802
while you still can.

831
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:08,043
Good afternoon, race fans,

832
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:12,484
and welcome to this year's
running of the Indianapolis 500.

833
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:14,847
Televised in over 200 countries

834
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:17,122
and aired in
33 different languages,

835
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:18,964
this is no longer just a race,

836
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:22,249
this is the day you'll be telling
your grandchildren about.

837
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:29,249
Where were you the day they let
a snail race in the Indy 500?

838
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:32,968
Okay, time to go.
You ready?

839
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:43,681
All right, team meeting.
Bring it in.

840
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:48,164
This is it, Little Amigo.
This is our moment. Our time.

841
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:50,846
Today is the day
we make our mark.

842
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:56,011
Everybody in!
It's go time!

843
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:06,644
Oh, Theo.
Be careful out there.

844
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:09,722
Hey, little snail.
Are you lost?

845
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:10,959
No.

846
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:13,279
Are you a boy, or a girl?

847
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:16,682
Why is this confusing?
I'm not a girl!

848
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:20,926
And there they are, folks. Some of
the biggest names in motorsport.

849
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:24,402
Shelby Stone, hot
off her win in Sao Paulo.

850
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:27,929
Oh, and there's Claudio Cruz, a.k.a.
The Brazilian Butcher.

851
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:31,084
He actually was a butcher before
he got into race car driving.

852
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:37,085
Gagné! Gagné! Gagné!

853
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:38,399
Hey!

854
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:42,199
And here he comes,
folks, le man, le myth, le legend...

855
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:43,919
le if I could choose
anybody in the world

856
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:46,082
to be my best friend
it would be...

857
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,049
Guy Gagné!

858
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:52,530
Yes, yes. Gagné, Gagné!

859
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:05,331
You know, food trucks are
actually very popular these days.

860
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:08,484
And I tell you what,
I do love a good torta.

861
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:18,931
Yeah!

862
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:22,480
And would you
look at those t-shirts?

863
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:25,888
It is amazing what you can
do on your printer at home.

864
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:30,045
Ay, Tito, you better
know what you're doing.

865
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:33,682
Here you go, little snail. Now you've
got the best seat in the house.

866
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:41,008
Oh, no. Nope.
This isn't happening.

867
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:42,685
I gotta get out of here.

868
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:45,009
Stay here.
I'll be right back.

869
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:48,439
Help! Let me out.
Let me out!

870
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,365
Breathe.

871
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:53,962
Good afternoon and welcome

872
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:58,768
to what has become the most
anticipated and unprecedented

873
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:01,730
running of
the Indianapolis 500.

874
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:04,167
So, without further ado,

875
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:09,281
ladies and gentlemen,
and snail,

876
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:12,842
start your engines!

877
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:25,201
It's like an earthquake!

878
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:27,164
I love it. Is it weird
that I love it?

879
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:29,249
Everyone,
off the track, please.

880
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:31,408
See you in the winner's
circle, garden snail.

881
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:33,244
Easy to the peasy, baby.

882
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:36,250
Everything's gonna be fine, okay?
We can do this, right?

883
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:39,721
Oh, I wish I was tiny,
so I can give you a hug.

884
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:40,881
Get off the track!

885
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:44,641
Okay, okay, I'm going!
Good luck out there, Turbo!

886
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,009
Did anybody bring earplugs?

887
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:08,207
What?

888
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:10,528
Oh, I can't watch this.

889
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:13,411
The pace car is off and the
parade laps are underway.

890
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:16,399
Only moments until
the green flag drops,

891
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:19,768
and history is made
here at Indianapolis.

892
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:49,325
Let's do this.

893
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:51,409
And the race is on!

894
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:53,604
You go, Turbo!

895
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:17,889
Turbo, struggling out there.

896
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:21,089
Looks like the party is over
for the motoring mollusk.

897
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:27,725
He's getting killed out there.

898
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:30,167
What have we done?

899
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:36,928
That snail is history.

900
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:39,487
Oh! I think
I'm gonna be sick.

901
01:07:57,360 --> 01:08:00,250
Come on, garden snail.
Get your head in the game!

902
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:22,969
Go, go, go!

903
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:28,406
All right, go, go, go!

904
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:34,359
Come on! We're supposed
to be a team here!

905
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:35,479
We're trying.

906
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:38,563
It's a snail. There's
not that much to do.

907
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:42,526
That's it. This pit crew is
officially under new management.

908
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:47,081
Now, this is how it's done.
Air jack.

909
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:48,844
Jack-tivate.

910
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,359
- Lube.
- Applied liberally.

911
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:51,407
Detailing.

912
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:52,845
Wax on, wax off.

913
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:54,599
- Fuel!
- Down the hatch.

914
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:55,759
Chug! Chug! Chug!

915
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:56,879
Foot massage.

916
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:58,599
You know it.

917
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:00,090
Relaxing vibes.

918
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:02,442
Own it, brother.

919
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:05,001
Now, de-lax those vibes!

920
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:06,366
Are you crazy?

921
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:08,847
Ow! Yeah, I'm crazy! What
made you think I was sane?

922
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:10,279
I don't know how to...

923
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:12,045
- Are you a car?
- No.

924
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:13,759
Are you a car?

925
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:14,841
No!

926
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:17,281
Then stop driving like one!

927
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:20,801
Now get out there.
Snail up, baby!

928
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:22,999
Go, T-boogie, go!

929
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:30,889
Gagné with
a commanding lead now.

930
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:34,647
Followed by Claudio Cruz,
Shelby Stone and Takao Noguchi.

931
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:41,128
Go! Come on.

932
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:51,450
Snail up.

933
01:09:57,640 --> 01:09:59,005
Snail up!

934
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:05,521
Yes!

935
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:09,399
I don't believe it!
Turbo just went under a car!

936
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:11,368
Did you see that?

937
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:22,127
Despite a rocky start, it looks like
Turbo is gaining some ground.

938
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:24,482
Yeah! Now we're talking!

939
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:32,085
Where is he?
Where is he?

940
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:49,569
He passed another one!

941
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:50,966
Yeah!

942
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:54,604
That's my brother, right there.
That's the back of his head!

943
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:10,402
Go, go, go!
Left turn! Left turn!

944
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:12,847
Yeah! Left turn!

945
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:30,087
Turbo maneuvers past
Shelby Stone and into second place!

946
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:32,208
He is hot on Gagné's heels!

947
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:34,249
The snail's not
going away, Guy.

948
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:36,971
All right, I know, I know!

949
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:49,080
These racers better
watch it coming into turn four.

950
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:52,244
This late in the race, that
outside edge is full of marbles.

951
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:54,801
And you don't want to play
with these marbles, kids.

952
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:56,719
That rubber
peeling off the tires

953
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:58,688
can be a minefield
for these drivers.

954
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:02,005
Here we go.

955
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:26,927
Turbo!

956
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:29,006
Oh, no.

957
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,525
Oh, man.

958
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:38,644
What are we gonna do? If he takes
another hit like that last one...

959
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:41,724
You gotta pull him, Tito.

960
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:47,885
I'm sorry, Little Amigo.
It's over.

961
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:58,007
Hey.

962
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:02,126
We got this far.
It's good enough.

963
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:06,844
No, it's not.

964
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:11,319
With the green
flag about to be waved,

965
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:13,322
it looks like a mere
formality at this point.

966
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:16,768
Gagné, just five laps
away from victory.

967
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:20,322
Wait a minute! Turbo is
still in this thing!

968
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:34,479
What?

969
01:13:34,980 --> 01:13:36,399
What happened there?

970
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:41,319
Come on, come on!

971
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:49,207
No!

972
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:51,322
Theo!

973
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:57,170
No!

974
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:02,126
- Not this time.
- Come on!

975
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:11,045
Come on, Turbo.
Come on, Turbo.

976
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:17,489
Come on, just hold in
there a little longer.

977
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:27,287
No!

978
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:37,999
No!

979
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:41,890
Farewell, little snail.

980
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:58,479
Unbelievable!
Turbo takes the lead.

981
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:01,244
Snail-style, baby!

982
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:03,479
Bad idea. Bad idea.

983
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:09,449
And the white flag is in the air as
we enter the 200th and final lap.

984
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:12,801
Turbo weaving between
lapped cars like a snail possessed.

985
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:16,606
He is determined to
hold onto his lead.

986
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:28,767
No!

987
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:32,966
I will not lose to a snail!

988
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:36,124
Gagné is in the marbles!

989
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:39,605
Guy, what are you doing?

990
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:02,327
Theo!

991
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:08,806
Turbo!

992
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:14,489
The track is backed up
all the way down the front straight.

993
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:17,689
It's complete
gridlock down there.

994
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:22,047
I can't see him.
I can't see him.

995
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:23,850
Guy, are you okay?

996
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:30,045
Where am I?

997
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:38,959
There he is.

998
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:39,999
Theo.

999
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,684
Let's finish this.

1000
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:01,611
Oh, no.

1001
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:03,884
Turbo.

1002
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:22,409
No, no, no. Theo, what are you doing?
Don't give up.

1003
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:37,087
Hey! Where are you going?

1004
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:38,359
No, no!

1005
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:40,283
Get back here! No, wait!

1006
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:45,764
No! Little snail!

1007
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:47,160
Theo!

1008
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:49,091
Is that Chet?

1009
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:59,007
Now, I'm gonna pretend I didn't
hear what I clearly just heard.

1010
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:04,487
Salt!

1011
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:12,447
Crows?
Are you kidding me?

1012
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:15,841
Long time no see, Chet!

1013
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:20,890
Hey!
Don't test me, crow.

1014
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:23,601
White Shadow!

1015
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:28,479
Nice moves back there, boo.

1016
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:36,442
Is this really necessary?

1017
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:39,119
No, man.
But it's fun.

1018
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:44,727
Theo!

1019
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:47,206
Theo!

1020
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:57,319
Chet?

1021
01:18:57,320 --> 01:18:58,685
Finish this!

1022
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:01,286
I can't.

1023
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:03,647
Oh, yes, you can.

1024
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:05,365
You're right, you know.

1025
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:09,411
It is in you.
It's always been in you.

1026
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:14,402
Now, I did not just face every
fear known to snail-kind

1027
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:18,127
to come down here and watch
you hide in your shell.

1028
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:21,279
I'm sitting on a crow,
for crying out loud!

1029
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:24,608
Don't even think about it.

1030
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:29,689
And my little brother
never gives up.

1031
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:32,924
That's the best
thing about you.

1032
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:37,162
So, you get out there
and you win this...

1033
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:39,360
Turbo.

1034
01:19:58,160 --> 01:19:59,525
He's still going.

1035
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:11,168
Son of a gun.

1036
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:26,605
Come on, come on!

1037
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:47,769
Unbelievable!
The race is back on!

1038
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:50,483
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

1039
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:53,080
Little Amigo!

1040
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:59,729
Hey, snail! He's gradually
gaining on you!

1041
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:26,051
Come on! Come on!

1042
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:40,600
Turbo! Tuck and roll!

1043
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,480
And Turbo wins it by a shell!

1044
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:09,005
That's what I'm talking about!

1045
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:13,563
Chet! Chet!

1046
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:15,087
Turbo!

1047
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:16,361
Chet!

1048
01:22:16,720 --> 01:22:18,768
We won, right?
We just won?

1049
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:20,724
We won.

1050
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:26,370
Hey, everybody! My brother
won the Indy 5,000!

1051
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:29,967
That's so romantic.

1052
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:33,571
Hey, Angelo. We did it!

1053
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:37,003
We did it. We did it!

1054
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:40,369
Free tacos for everybody!

1055
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:43,364
Snail power, baby!

1056
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:48,121
Mom.

1057
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:51,245
Hey, Gagné! Why don't you pick
on someone your own size?

1058
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:53,209
- You big bad boy!
- Security!

1059
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:55,243
I step on you!
Do you like that?

1060
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:56,600
- Sleeper hold!
- All right.

1061
01:22:56,760 --> 01:22:59,411
Let go of me!
I'm just an old lady!

1062
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:03,245
Kim Ly Nail Salon!

1063
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:11,242
That's our snail!

1064
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:18,087
It's like I always said,
Little Amigo, you are amazing!

1065
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:21,526
Okay, wait.

1066
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:23,722
Just keep your eyes closed
until I say so, okay?

1067
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:26,087
Tito, this is stupid.

1068
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:31,162
Hello, Angelo.
Let's get cooking.

1069
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:36,001
The stove talks, bro.

1070
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:39,284
No, honey, soonest available
three months from now, 6:00 a.m.

1071
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:42,205
Brenda, that daisy really
brings out your foot!

1072
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:47,761
Hey, I'm not paying you guys
to sit around and look pretty.

1073
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:50,284
Now, that's more like it.

1074
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:51,759
Check it out.

1075
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:52,959
This guy is good.

1076
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:55,611
And last, but not least,
Sanitation.

1077
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:57,802
Nice choice, young man.

1078
01:23:57,960 --> 01:24:01,442
Come on, boys. It's time
to take out the trash.

1079
01:24:06,380 --> 01:24:08,286
Take a look at this place.

1080
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:12,724
Like I said, your skills
have truly paid the bills.

1081
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:14,803
Yeah, bills.

1082
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:26,405
What you saying, bro?

1083
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:37,610
All racers to
the starting line.

1084
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:38,839
Hey, T.

1085
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:41,810
You gonna be okay without those
fancy magic superpowers?

1086
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:45,248
Sure, it never stopped
any of you.

1087
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:51,681
Yeah!

1088
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:55,967
Qué pasa, my friend?

1089
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,321
You see that?
All these people?

1090
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:06,007
You did that, Little Amigo.
You put this place on the map.

1091
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:09,810
You really are
my little shooting star.

1092
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:13,122
Oh, I almost forgot.
I got you something.

1093
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:17,124
You won't be missing this.

1094
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:19,886
What? You're all better.

1095
01:25:24,140 --> 01:25:25,719
Oh, that's nice.

1096
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:31,327
Okay, listen up. Let's
have a nice, safe race out there today.

1097
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:33,124
Don't want any accidents.

1098
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:34,850
That being said,

1099
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,809
blow them off the track, bro.

1100
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:42,119
Mmm, I love a man
in uniform. For real!

1101
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:46,722
Simmer down, boo.
I'm on duty, here.

1102
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:48,086
On your mark.

1103
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:51,528
All right, so, you got
a new shell.

1104
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:54,160
But can yours do this?
Hit it, Burn!

1105
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:13,368
Get set.

1106
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:23,848
Go.

1107
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:33,159
- Come on! Let's do it!
- Yeah!

1108
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:38,281
Hello!

1109
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:48,881
Yes, sir.

1110
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:11,287
What'd I say?
What'd I say?

1111
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:25,289
Oh, yeah!

1112
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:39,968
White Shadow!

1113
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:24,211
I can tuck.
I can tuck.

1114
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:26,050
Okay, baby, here we go.

1115
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:27,964
Come on.

1116
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:34,439
I did it!
I tucked! I tucked!

1117
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:38,564
I can't get out.

1118
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:50,066
<i>That snail is fast!</i>

1119
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:52,605
<i>That snail is fast!</i>

1120
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:54,279
<i>What?</i>

1121
01:28:54,280 --> 01:28:56,123
<i>That snail is fast!</i>

1122
01:28:58,920 --> 01:29:00,365
<i>Turbo!</i>

1123
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:02,159
<i>That snail is fast!</i>

1124
01:29:05,080 --> 01:29:06,719
<i>Turbo!</i>

1125
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:08,519
<i>That snail is fast!</i>

1126
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:11,439
<i>That snail is fast!</i>

1127
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:12,919
<i>Think that snail's really fast</i>

1128
01:29:12,920 --> 01:29:14,559
<i>When they race, he won't crash</i>

1129
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:16,039
<i>On your mark, ready, set, go!</i>

1130
01:29:16,040 --> 01:29:17,639
<i>Watch that snail
doing that dash</i>

1131
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:19,119
<i>Want to be number one</i>

1132
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:20,679
<i>He definitely races fast</i>

1133
01:29:20,680 --> 01:29:22,279
<i>Got that pedal to the metal</i>

1134
01:29:22,280 --> 01:29:23,759
<i>Vroom, vroom!
Flooring that gas</i>

1135
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:26,639
<i>Got a need for speed
that's all the people see</i>

1136
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:28,239
<i>You watch him move so fast</i>

1137
01:29:28,240 --> 01:29:29,679
<i>Man, it's hard to believe</i>

1138
01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:31,519
<i>But guess who did it,
yeah, he did it</i>

1139
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:33,279
<i>He would never quit it</i>

1140
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:36,199
<i>To all his friends and fans,
look at him crossing the finish</i>

1141
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:38,279
<i>Turbo!
You see this snail moving fast</i>

1142
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:39,919
<i>You slow, you gonna get passed</i>

1143
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:41,919
<i>You see him
gaining position for first</i>

1144
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:43,039
<i>He won't be last</i>

1145
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:44,371
<i>He's ready to make a dash</i>

1146
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:46,079
<i>Snail quicker than
a lighting flash</i>

1147
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:47,105
<i>His engine's roaring</i>

1148
01:29:47,106 --> 01:29:48,559
<i>He's flooring,
he won't run out of gas</i>

1149
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:50,639
<i>Turbo!
The snail is fast</i>

<i>The snail is fast,
fast, fast, fast, fast</i>

1155
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:04,079
<i>Don't think this snail can race
or even be a winner either?</i>

1156
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:05,639
<i>When he get behind the wheel</i>

1157
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:07,479
<i>In the race,
he'll be the leader</i>

1158
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:10,399
<i>He'll be numero uno,
call him Turbo, Mr. Snail</i>

1159
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:12,159
<i>On the race track</i>

1160
01:30:12,160 --> 01:30:13,479
<i>Hit the gas and never fail</i>

1161
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:15,359
<i>Love the speed, going fast</i>

1162
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:17,999
<i>Headed right past you,
winner of the race</i>

1163
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,159
<i>Turbo snail, yup, that's who</i>

1164
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:22,279
<i>So buckle up, do your thing</i>

1165
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:25,119
<i>No one on the track
ever raced past him to win</i>

1166
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:26,360
<i>Look at him, Turbo!</i>

1167
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:27,839
