1
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,235
Stairs.

2
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,630
I don't think I can...

3
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,280
You guys,
just start without me.

4
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,792
I'll catch up!

5
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,832
Sweet.

6
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,593
Inner peace.

7
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,836
Itchy nose.

8
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,317
Finally, inner peace.

9
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,360
Now what?

10
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,590
Kai, old friend.

11
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,588
Master Oogway.

12
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,917
Our battle ended
500 years ago!

13
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,675
Well, now I'm ready
for a rematch.

14
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,876
Took you long enough!

15
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,756
You've grown stronger.

16
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,830
500 years in the Spirit Realm,
you pick up a thing or two.

17
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,919
I have taken the chi
of every master here.

18
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,318
And soon I will have
your power, too.

19
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,391
When will you realize?

20
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,914
The more you take,
the less you have.

21
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,029
With your chi,

22
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,715
I will finally be able
to return to the mortal world.

23
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,913
And this time,
you won't be there to stop me.

24
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,753
It was never my destiny
to stop you.

25
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,992
I have set another
on that path.

26
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,276
Then I will find him,

27
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,040
and take his chi, too.

28
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,239
Justice is about to be served!

29
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,078
We'll have two Justice Platters,
please.

30
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,160
Three.

31
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,240
And a few tofu buns.

32
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,469
The spicy noodle
soup for Tigress.

33
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,754
Did you want extra
sauce with that?

34
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,840
She wants it
on the side.

35
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,312
Go, Dragon
Warrior! You can do it!

36
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,715
Defend the Valley!

37
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,190
You guys aren't doing
the Dramatic Pose, are you?

38
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,590
Do we have to strike a pose
every time we land?

39
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,598
You guys, never underestimate

40
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,159
the power
of a Dramatic Entrance.

41
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,912
I've heard about some masters
who can win a fight

42
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,672
just by throwing open a door.

43
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,628
Dramatic Entrance?

44
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,920
Master Shifu.

45
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,831
The Dragon Warrior is correct.

46
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,716
I am.

47
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,792
Before the battle of the fist
comes the battle of the mind.

48
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,520
Hence, the Dramatic Entrance.

49
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,877
Nice Dramatic Entrance.
What's the occasion?

50
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,713
Today will be
my final class.

51
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,399
Your final... Wait.

52
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,039
I didn't even know
you were sick!

53
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,230
Although you have been looking
a little... I'm not sick.

54
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,390
A little healthy. A lot, actually.

55
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,990
My final class,
because from now on,

56
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,310
your training will be
in the hands

57
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,152
of the Dragon Warrior.

58
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,160
What?

59
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,871
Me, teach?
I mean, why not, Tigress?

60
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,234
She's always telling
everyone what to do.

61
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,320
Be quiet, Po.

62
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,549
You see what I mean?

63
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,312
Tigress is not
the Dragon Warrior.

64
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,800
You are.

65
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,438
Come on,
they're the Five.

66
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,158
What could I teach them?

67
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,949
There is always something more
to learn, even for a master.

68
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,235
For instance,

69
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,436
let me show you
another move,

70
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,916
the Dramatic Exit.

71
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,232
What's that?

72
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,637
Are you kidding me?

73
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,756
Where'd he go?

74
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,797
He's gone, guys.
It's cool.

75
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,235
We await your
instruction, Master.

76
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,113
All you have to lose
is our respect.

77
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,278
I mean, seriously,
how bad can it be?

78
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,316
Very bad!

79
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,277
Okay, okay.
Let's switch it up.

80
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,237
Monkey!
Immovable Mountain Stance!

81
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,594
Yes, Master!

82
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,036
Tigress,
Tornado Back Flip!

83
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,235
Yes, Master.

84
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,319
Fire!

85
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,400
- Fire!
- Stop!

86
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,118
Sorry! My fault.

87
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,557
Crane, go high.
I mean low!

88
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,918
Viper and Tigress, do,

89
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,992
a Totem Pole
Poison Technique!

90
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,231
You two,
do a Swarming Insect Bite

91
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,671
with a Yellow Tail,
Yellow Jacket, Spicy Tuna...

92
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,193
I'm sorry.

93
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,789
Good job, Po.

94
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,755
Did you at least learn
a little something?

95
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,989
Yes.

96
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,798
That you can't teach.

97
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,235
And Tigress is flammable,
it turns out.

98
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,874
Yeah, that was
a complete disaster.

99
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,917
I'm glad
we're not Po right now.

100
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,115
What a loser!

101
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,514
What was Shifu thinking?

102
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,040
What was Oogway thinking?

103
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,790
I think he heard us.

104
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,632
I didn't hear
anything.

105
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,717
He said
you're a loser.

106
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,071
I'm sorry, Oogway.

107
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,589
Would you stop
doing that?

108
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,318
How was your
first day teaching?

109
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,833
Humiliating.

110
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,920
I heard.

111
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,433
Who told you?
Did Tigress tell you?

112
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,670
I heard from Monkey,
and Crane, and Mantis,

113
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,912
and your dad,
and Mrs. Chao from the gift shop,

114
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,672
and those ducks
you just passed,

115
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,280
and Tigress told me.

116
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,277
Yeah, well, did she also tell you
that it'll never happen again?

117
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,429
Because I'm done.

118
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,590
Teaching or being humiliated?

119
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,513
Both! I don't know why you ever
thought I could teach that class.

120
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,319
I knew you couldn't.

121
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,438
What? You set me
up to fail? Why?

122
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,556
If you only do
what you can do,

123
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,393
you will never be
more than you are now.

124
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,308
I don't wanna be more!
I like who I am.

125
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,153
You don't even know
who you are.

126
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,719
Of course I do.

127
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,438
I'm the Dragon Warrior.

128
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,353
And what exactly does
that mean, Dragon Warrior?

129
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,156
It means, you know,
just going around

130
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,559
and punching and kicking.

131
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,314
Defending the Valley!
And stuff.

132
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,919
Punching and kicking?

133
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,229
You think that is what

134
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,356
the great Master Oogway
saw for you?

135
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,309
A 500-year
prophecy fulfilled

136
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,960
so you could spend
your days kicking butt

137
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,839
and running through town
high-fiving bunnies?

138
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,873
Yes?
No!

139
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,634
Oogway saw greatness
in you, Po.

140
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,711
Against my better judgment.

141
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,678
More than you can see
in yourself.

142
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,553
Incredible power awaits you.

143
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,919
Power beyond anything
you can imagine.

144
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,516
What was that?

145
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,954
That was chi.

146
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,800
What's chi?

147
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:45,636
The energy that flows
through all living things.

148
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,870
So you're saying
if I teach,

149
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,194
I'll be able to do
cool stuff like that?

150
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,476
No. I'm saying
if you teach,

151
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,471
I'll be able to do
cool stuff like that.

152
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,155
Mastering chi requires
mastery of self.

153
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,197
Oogway sat alone in a cave

154
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,955
for 30 years
asking one question.

155
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,913
"Who am I?"

156
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,752
I'm lucky if
I get five minutes

157
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,200
before you interrupt...

158
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,715
So now I have to sit alone
in a cave for 30 years?

159
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,840
Eventually.

160
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,512
After you master teaching.

161
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,831
Teaching? There's no way
I'm ever gonna be like you.

162
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,956
I'm not trying
to turn you into me.

163
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,312
I'm trying to
turn you into you.

164
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,273
Turn me into me?

165
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,560
Wait a second,
that makes no...

166
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,755
Almost there, Shifu.

167
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,117
Just a little more confusing
and you'll be the next Oogway.

168
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,918
Sorry, no offense,
Master Oogway.

169
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,840
I'll let you get back
to your eternal peace.

170
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,872
What is this place?

171
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,917
My brother's farm?

172
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,872
If I stepped on you,
would you die?

173
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,160
Yes.

174
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,756
The mortal realm.

175
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,955
You hear that, Oogway?
I'm back.

176
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,433
Kai has returned!

177
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,715
Who?

178
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,838
Kai. General Kai.

179
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,158
Supreme Warlord of all China.

180
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,391
The Jade Slayer.
Master of Pain.

181
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,349
You may know me as
the Beast of Vengeance.

182
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,277
Maker of Widows?

183
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,998
Okay, I used to
work with Oogway.

184
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,669
Now, he was a great warrior.

185
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,994
We've heard of
Master Oogway.

186
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,276
Okay, okay,
enough. Silence!

187
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,278
Find Oogway's students,
and bring them to me.

188
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,992
By the time I am done
with them, Oogway,

189
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,711
there will be no one left who
will even remember your name.

190
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,793
Kai is coming!

191
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,959
I am ready

192
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,554
to teach you a lesson.

193
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,029
Teach me?
It's the Dragon Teacher!

194
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,633
Yeah, he's so handsome!

195
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,960
Thank you for the compliment.

196
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,991
No! Please don't
teach me to death!

197
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,311
Dad.
What's up?

198
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,079
I was just,
stopping by for a little soak.

199
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,069
Okay. What's wrong?

200
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,160
Nothing.

201
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,878
Nothing? I come home

202
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,598
to find you taking
a bath with your dolls...

203
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,680
Action figures.

204
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,916
And instead of adding
bath salts to the water,

205
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,718
you just added
Szechuan peppercorns.

206
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,880
Szechuan...

207
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,079
Okay, yes,
something's wrong.

208
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,389
There, there, son.

209
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,272
You tell your daddy
all about it.

210
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,595
Lift your arm.

211
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,398
Shifu says I don't
know what it means

212
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,879
to be the Dragon Warrior.

213
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,190
Now I have to be a teacher?

214
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,799
I thought I finally
knew who I was.

215
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,190
If I'm not the Dragon Warrior,
then who am I?

216
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,715
A teacher?
Teaching kung fu?

217
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,870
Po, that's a promotion!

218
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,195
Take the job, son!

219
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,680
And, someday when
you're in charge

220
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,795
of the whole Jade Palace,

221
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,912
I can sell noodles
in the lobby!

222
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,440
Why are you still here
taking a bath like a baby?

223
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,635
Get out! Get up!

224
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,798
Franchise expansion awaits us!

225
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,040
But what about the Dragon
Warrior look-alike contest?

226
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,838
Mrs. Chow
always wins that.

227
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,799
Skadoosh.

228
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,190
And the Dragon Warrior
dumpling-eating contest?

229
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,349
I have to defend my title.

230
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,120
No one's gonna beat your
dumpling-eating record.

231
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,320
Someone's about to beat your
dumpling-eating record!

232
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,311
Go! Go!

233
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,799
Who's eating my dumplings?

234
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,234
And who's paying
for them?

235
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,229
101! 102!

236
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,196
103!

237
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,233
Yeah!

238
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,833
Is that a new record?

239
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,719
Who are you?

240
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,871
I am Li Shan.

241
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,040
What?

242
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,871
I'm looking for my son.

243
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,199
You lost your son?

244
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,594
Yes.

245
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,876
Many years ago.

246
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,033
I lost my father.

247
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,198
I'm very sorry.

248
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,555
Thank you.

249
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,834
Well, good luck to you.

250
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,913
You, too.

251
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,752
I hope you find your son.

252
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,589
And I hope you find
your father.

253
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,836
My gosh, it is you!

254
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,435
Well, don't just stand there.
Give your old man a hug!

255
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,596
I can't believe
you're alive!

256
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,869
I thought I lost
you forever, Little Lotus.

257
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,758
Okay. This is
very embarrassing,

258
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,949
but I think you've
got me confused

259
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,115
with a panda named Lotus.

260
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,315
My name is Po.

261
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,710
Right,
you wouldn't know.

262
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,672
See, Little Lotus

263
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,836
was the name you
were given at birth.

264
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,600
I can't believe it!

265
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,477
After all these years,
you're really here?

266
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,113
This is amazing!

267
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,271
Come! Say hi to, um...

268
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,908
I don't know what
I'm supposed to call you.

269
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,911
I'm pretty sure
he said his name is Li.

270
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,439
Come here.

271
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,358
Thank you, thank you

272
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,755
for taking such
good care of my son.

273
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:40,117
Your son?
Now, hold on just a minute.

274
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,989
How do we know this stranger
is even related to you?

275
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,479
Look at that.

276
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,949
Our bellies could be brothers!
That is so cool.

277
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,951
Son, let me teach you
how to belly gong.

278
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,000
- All right. Belly gong.
- They jiggle the same!

279
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,877
It's like looking
in a fat mirror.

280
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,389
I can't believe we're
taking a picture together.

281
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,471
But I still
don't understand.

282
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,551
I thought Po
was the only panda left.

283
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,518
There's a whole bunch of us.

284
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,999
Where?

285
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,469
A secret panda
village in the mountains.

286
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,709
A secret panda...

287
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,478
But how did you know
where I was?

288
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,473
I received a message
that led me here.

289
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,392
How could you
receive a message

290
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,829
if no one
could find you?

291
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,268
Sounds suspicious to me.

292
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,994
No, it was a message
from the universe.

293
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,320
Rats!

294
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,557
Now, what's all
this about a Dragon Warrior?

295
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,637
How did you know
I was a Dragon Warrior?

296
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,312
Did the universe
tell you that, too?

297
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,669
No, the poster did.

298
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,875
And the gift shop.

299
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,673
I bought a tiny cup.

300
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,434
Of course!

301
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,438
You have no idea.
There's so much to show you.

302
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,960
You're gonna be
so awesomely proud.

303
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,758
Come on, come on!

304
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,358
I'm already
awesomely proud.

305
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,716
- Couple more steps.
- Give me a minute.

306
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,280
Feeling the burn.

307
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,955
Do you have
panda asthma, too?

308
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,792
Does that run
in the family?

309
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,514
Dad, you're
gonna love this.

310
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,398
It's, like,
the coolest thing ever.

311
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,914
This is the Hall of Heroes.

312
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,229
Home of the most priceless

313
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,918
kung fu artifacts
in all of China!

314
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,038
This place is...

315
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,360
Awesome?
Were you gonna say...

316
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,312
You were gonna say "awesome,"
right? Because it totally is!

317
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,516
Totally!
But be super careful.

318
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,635
Everything's very
fragile here.

319
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,512
Like the Urn
of Whispering Warriors.

320
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,113
Someone broke that once.

321
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,799
Who?
Some idiot.

322
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,596
This is Master Flying
Rhino's battle armor!

323
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,115
I wonder if
I could fit in that.

324
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,475
Get out of my head, Dad!
I've wondered the same thing!

325
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,640
If I could fit in it?

326
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,199
If you could?
No, if I could fit.

327
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,077
Dad, check it out!

328
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,995
Master Ram's crossbow,
the infamous Gate Smasher.

329
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,160
Dad, look at this!

330
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,912
The battle helmets
of Master Rat's army.

331
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,319
They're so tiny!

332
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,512
Master Dolphin's
waterproof armor!

333
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,749
This is my favorite.

334
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,353
Check it out.
It's the legendary

335
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,953
battle rickshaw
of Emperor Hawk.

336
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,913
Sweet ride.

337
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,240
Dad, what are
you doing?

338
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,720
We're not supposed
to touch anything!

339
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,473
Should I put it back?

340
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,358
Yeah, you probably should.

341
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,476
You look so cool, though.

342
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,079
How does it feel?

343
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,430
Do the hinges hinge?
Does it smell like rhino?

344
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,272
Does it feel like
you're impenetrable?

345
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,640
Does it feel like you could
take on a thousand warriors,

346
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,320
and emerge unscathed?

347
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,313
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

348
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,751
I wonder what this does.
I should pull it.

349
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,712
I think I just peed a little.

350
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,315
Anything else
we should try in here, son?

351
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,669
Charge!

352
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,310
Faster!

353
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,674
Thumb war!

354
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,193
Reinforcements!

355
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,918
No fair.

356
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,832
This is so much fu...

357
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,879
Here we go!

358
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,678
Awesome!
Faster.

359
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,353
There, there.

360
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,919
I'm fine.

361
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,514
There you go.

362
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,756
Dolphin-Style Attack!

363
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,075
You got me.
Dolphin-Style Retreat!

364
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,158
Go long, son!

365
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,391
I wasn't ready!

366
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,192
Coming back at you.
I got it.

367
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,753
I'm going high!
There you go.

368
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,920
Come on, throw it!

369
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,553
I'm coming for you.

370
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,559
Bring it on, Master Rhino.

371
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,680
Here I come!

372
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,717
I am gonna get you!

373
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,990
I'm gonna get you!

374
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,950
Who's gonna get you?

375
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,793
Master Rhino.

376
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,111
What? What's wrong?

377
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,236
You're never gonna guess
who just showed up.

378
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,197
Not in a million years.

379
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,280
You just try.

380
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,714
Your father!

381
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,472
How did you
just guess that?

382
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,629
Wait a second.
Yeah, of course.

383
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,760
We look exactly the same.

384
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,638
Dad, say hi
to my friends.

385
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,110
Mantis, Tigress,
Monkey, Crane, and Viper.

386
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,315
Viper, was it?

387
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,400
Monkey, sir.

388
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,795
They're kind of my best friends.
And this...

389
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,110
This is Master Shifu. Legend.

390
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,431
It is an honor to
meet you, Master Panda.

391
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,431
Perhaps your father
would care to join us

392
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,635
in the training hall.

393
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,677
Your son will be
teaching the class.

394
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,473
I'm sure he's tired.

395
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,437
I'm sure you're tired.
He's tired.

396
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,794
I'm gonna show him
to the Chrysanthemum Suite.

397
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,871
What, tired?
No, I'm fine.

398
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,439
I would love
to watch you teach.

399
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,953
Trust me, it'll be more
fun just to watch me...

400
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,638
Fight!

401
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,800
What is that?

402
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,359
The Valley's under attack.

403
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,198
Son? Under attack?

404
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,360
This is perfect!

405
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,034
Now you can see what being the
Dragon Warrior's all about!

406
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,200
Follow me!

407
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,950
Enemies of justice,
prepare for war!

408
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,678
Are you kidding me?

409
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,952
What's the deal
with the green guys?

410
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,948
Some kind of jade zombies.

411
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,553
Jade zombies?

412
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,312
Jombies! Jinx!

413
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,873
Lotus, be careful!

414
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,474
It's okay, Dad,
I do this every day!

415
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,358
I recognize
these guys.

416
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,873
The Master Badger Twins,

417
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,712
with their Crushing
Double-Gong technique!

418
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,678
Yeah, that's the one!

419
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,955
And that guy is...

420
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,031
No! Master Porcupine!

421
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,351
I thought he died
a hundred years ago.

422
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,317
These guys are legend!

423
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,711
Get a quick sketch of us.

424
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,233
Did you get it?
Did you get it?

425
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,039
I blinked.

426
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,800
Can we get another one?

427
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,669
I'm being choked
by Master Porcupine.

428
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,829
This is so cool.

429
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,398
It's you!

430
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,278
Po, focus!

431
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,079
"Message from the universe."

432
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,555
I'll give you a message
from the universe.

433
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,073
Stay away from my son!

434
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,600
Sorry, Dad.
I'll clean up later.

435
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,193
Not my good pan!

436
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,395
Take this one.

437
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,074
Lotus! Watch out!

438
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,192
Dad, check out
my Dumplings of Doom.

439
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,760
Gotcha.

440
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,153
I see you.

441
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,474
<i>Your chi will soon be mine.</i>

442
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,675
Is he talking to me?
Which one?

443
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,795
They're all talking.

444
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,110
You're right.
That's so scary.

445
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,271
We should try that, too.
Maybe it'd be scary back at them.

446
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,953
Okay, but we gotta plan
what we're gonna say first.

447
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,633
Otherwise, it won't be scary.
It'll just be stupid.

448
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,149
<i>It's not them talking,
you idiots!</i>

449
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,833
<i>It's me talking
through them. Kai!</i>

450
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,280
Who?

451
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,431
Enough.

452
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,040
Did you see that?
What just happened?

453
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,509
The green smoke, just poof!
And then poof!

454
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,159
Shifu, what was that?

455
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,318
Kai... Kai... Kai...

456
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,318
Nope, never heard of him.

457
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,800
Where is it?

458
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,040
There's so much wisdom in here,
I can't find anything.

459
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,195
Yes!

460
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,198
Behold.

461
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,754
All the answers
will be found within.

462
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,110
What? It's blank?

463
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,633
Are you kidding me?
Not again.

464
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,037
Wait, wait, hold on. Sorry.

465
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,634
Okay. Here we go.

466
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,880
It is written
in Oogway's hand.

467
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,395
"Long ago, I had a brother..."

468
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,953
Oogway had a brother?

469
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,476
"In arms. In arms." Sorry.
He says, "Brother-in-arms."

470
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,471
Maybe you should just
unroll it all at once?

471
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:44,070
"I was an ambitious young
warrior leading a great army."

472
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,839
<i>And fighting
by my side was Kai,</i>

473
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,996
<i>my closest friend.</i>

474
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,758
<i>One day, we were ambushed.</i>

475
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,876
<i>I was badly wounded.</i>

476
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:04,352
<i>My friend carried me for days,
looking for help,</i>

477
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,553
<i>until we came
to a secret village,</i>

478
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,676
<i>high in the mountains.</i>

479
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,593
<i>An ancient place of healing.</i>

480
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,638
<i>A village of pandas.</i>

481
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,358
Pandas?

482
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,511
<i>Yes, pandas.</i>

483
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:23,673
<i>Pandas who used
the power of chi to heal me.</i>

484
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:30,198
<i>They taught me
how to give chi.</i>

485
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:39,430
<i>But Kai wanted
the power all to himself.</i>

486
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:44,878
<i>He saw that what could be
given could also be taken.</i>

487
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,909
<i>I had to stop him.</i>

488
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,273
<i>Our battle shook the earth,</i>

489
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,271
<i>until, finally,</i>

490
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,750
<i>I banished Kai
to the Spirit Realm.</i>

491
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,559
<i>Should he ever return
to the mortal realm,</i>

492
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,918
<i>he can only be stopped
by a true master of chi.</i>

493
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,633
"True master of chi"?

494
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,800
Like you!

495
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,718
Me? I can barely
make a flower bloom.

496
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,434
I need at least
30 more years, and a cave.

497
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,720
We need a chi master.

498
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,512
He will
continue stealing

499
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,480
the chi of masters
until he has consumed it all.

500
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,828
We have to think
of a way to stop him!

501
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,274
He'll get more
and more powerful

502
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,958
with every master he defeats.

503
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,600
There is
no choice. We fight.

504
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,392
I can teach you, son.

505
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,790
You can do this?

506
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,793
Of course. I'm a panda.

507
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,788
That must be why
the universe sent you here!

508
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,591
Okay, so what do I
have to do?

509
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,591
You have to
come home with me.

510
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,760
What?

511
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,319
To the secret village?

512
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,480
Yes, son.

513
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,030
You must rediscover
what it is to be a panda.

514
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,395
You have to learn
to live like a panda,

515
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,993
sleep like a panda,

516
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,037
eat like a panda.

517
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,234
Those 103 dumplings?

518
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,276
I was just warming up.

519
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,192
I've always felt like
I wasn't eating up

520
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,673
to my full potential.

521
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,834
No, you can't take Po
away from me. No.

522
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,194
I want a second opinion.

523
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,715
Shifu, open another
scroll or something.

524
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,639
I think he should go.

525
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,279
Fine, a third opinion.

526
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,550
Monkey? Viper? Tigress?

527
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,393
Dad, you heard what
Shifu said Oogway said.

528
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:26,233
This guy can only be stopped
by a master of chi.

529
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,631
And I can only master chi
by knowing who I really am.

530
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,390
Well, I'm a panda.

531
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,516
I'll pack you a lunch
for the road.

532
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,873
Do you really think
Po can master chi in time?

533
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,712
Doesn't matter
what I think.

534
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,717
It only matters
what the universe thinks.

535
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,757
So, that's a "no"?

536
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,558
Master, what are
we going to do?

537
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,676
You are going to find
out where Kai is.

538
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,440
Follow the trail
of those jade creatures.

539
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,154
But do not engage,

540
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,716
for with every foe he faces,
Kai becomes stronger.

541
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,871
Why me? Is it
because I asked?

542
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,554
No. It is because
you can fly. Go!

543
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,556
Should have kept
your beak shut.

544
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,835
And take Mantis.

545
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,355
Lunch break.

546
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,999
You don't need
to ask me twice.

547
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,075
What are you doing here?

548
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,708
What am I doing?
Getting a backache.

549
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,791
Did you have to step
on every rock?

550
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,752
No, I mean,
why are you here?

551
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,473
What was I supposed
to do?

552
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,716
What if the pandas
don't have food you like?

553
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,717
You're never gonna be able
to save the world

554
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,432
on an empty stomach.

555
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,114
I consider my presence
mission critical.

556
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,633
Yes, about that...

557
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:15,634
We can't share the location of
the village with others. So...

558
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,792
Well, you think I can't
keep a secret?

559
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,951
I raised Po for 20 years

560
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,196
before I finally
told him he was adopted.

561
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,157
Seriously?
Yeah.

562
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,432
Okay. I guess it would be
cruel to make you fly back.

563
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,758
You can fly?

564
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,273
I'm a bird, Po.

565
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,160
We're here.

566
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,672
Sure looks like a long
ways up there.

567
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,671
And my son hates stairs.

568
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,273
So, let's go home.

569
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,948
We're pandas.
We don't do stairs.

570
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,031
I've waited my whole life
to hear those words.

571
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,195
Rats.

572
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,880
This is the secret
panda village?

573
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,076
No wonder
you keep it a secret.

574
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,038
If I lived here,
I wouldn't tell anyone either.

575
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,392
Now you can "Whoa."

576
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,560
Let's go!

577
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,760
Over here! Come on!

578
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,232
Look over there!

579
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,351
My turn!
Come on, faster, faster!

580
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,240
Li?

581
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,072
Everyone! Li's back!

582
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,310
They're both back!
He found his son!

583
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,475
He made it!
They're back!

584
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,238
Li?
He found his son!

585
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,038
Everyone! Li's back!

586
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,151
Hang on, we're coming!

587
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,117
He made it!

588
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,952
They made it!
Why are we running?

589
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,991
- Here we come!
- He's back!

590
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,752
They made it!

591
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,076
Li Shan is back!

592
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,155
Everyone!

593
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,635
Everyone, gather around!
This is my son!

594
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,915
Hello.
He's here!

595
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,479
You're here!
Triplets!

596
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,959
I'm Ku Ku!

597
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,109
I'm Meng Meng.
I'm Shuai Shuai.

598
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,918
Your fur is soft.
He smells like cookies.

599
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:13,629
He's so handsome,
just like his father.

600
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,800
Thank you.

601
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,951
Son, these are
your cousins.

602
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,758
Dim and Sum.

603
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,840
I have cousins!

604
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,960
Welcome!

605
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,639
Buns on a string.

606
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,835
We call it a snacklace.

607
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,320
That's right.

608
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,352
We'll make
you another one.

609
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,675
It's you!

610
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,474
That's nice. Yeah!

611
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,471
I don't know who you are.

612
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,995
Stripy Baby. So beautiful.

613
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,280
Okay, careful with that.
That's my action figure.

614
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,436
Can I keep her? No...

615
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,269
Problem. Of course.

616
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,640
Yeah.
That's why I brought her.

617
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,789
Take good care of her.

618
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,269
Yes! Stripy Baby.

619
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:55,155
You look just like me,
but a baby.

620
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,792
You're like me, but old.

621
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,838
You're like me, but fatter!

622
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,797
You're like me, but

623
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,229
with a hat.

624
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,198
He does wear a hat!

625
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,032
You all look like me.

626
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,040
Let's feast in
my son's honor.

627
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,989
Pandas don't walk. We roll!

628
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,435
Have you ever seen anyone
look so ridiculous?

629
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,077
Po, what are
you doing?

630
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,876
You're right,
that is better than walking.

631
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,988
Yeah, that's the good stuff.

632
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,160
Have some dumplings.

633
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,509
What kind of panda
doesn't know how to roll?

634
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,194
Well, I'm kind of new at this
whole "being a panda" thing.

635
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,839
What kind
of panda are you?

636
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,399
You have a funny neck.

637
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,555
I'm not a panda at all.

638
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,919
What's that? What's that?
My hat. My beak.

639
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,040
What's that?
My wing.

640
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,718
What's that?
My dumplings.

641
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,916
No more questions!
Go away, kid.

642
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,718
Here, son. I packed
your chopsticks.

643
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,800
- Thanks, Dad.

644
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,080
What?

645
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,755
What are those for?

646
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,000
These? These
are chopsticks.

647
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,069
They're for picking
up dumplings.

648
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,959
You mean you only eat
one at a time?

649
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,915
Yummy.

650
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,954
I knew I wasn't eating
up to my potential!

651
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,915
I am Mei Mei.

652
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:54,516
She's amazing.
She's so beautiful.

653
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,908
That's sweet, Po.

654
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,469
But please, try to save
all other compliments

655
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,477
until after the performance.

656
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,432
Shut it.

657
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,158
After the performance.

658
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,311
Has it
started yet?

659
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:16,755
Best ribbon dancer
in the world!

660
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,279
At least,
that's what she said.

661
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,998
Look away. Look away.

662
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,310
No. You can't, can you?

663
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,994
Dad, why does she
keep staring at me like

664
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,120
that!

665
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,160
Try to keep up.

666
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,872
I don't really know
how to dance!

667
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,112
Of course you do.
All pandas dance.

668
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,195
I know what you were thinking.
You do?

669
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,550
"How can one
panda be so beautiful?"

670
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,316
For me?

671
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,156
Help me, Dads.
Yeah, no, you're on your own.

672
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,548
You're doing
great, son.

673
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,028
Your turn.

674
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,555
Don't worry.
You'll get the hang of it.

675
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,992
I have so much to learn.

676
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,676
Wings of Surveillance!

677
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,398
Why do you do that?
Do what?

678
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,198
Just because you say
"Wings of" before something,

679
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,998
it doesn't mean that you're
doing a special move.

680
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,395
It's like me saying
"Antenna of Power"

681
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,717
or "Thorax of
Making Sandwiches."

682
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,194
Wings of Disagreement.

683
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,315
Master Bear,
Master Chicken, Master Croc!

684
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,594
What are you doing out here?

685
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,438
Jade creatures
attacked our villages.

686
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,709
We've tracked them here.

687
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,393
Stop!

688
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,070
They must be in there.

689
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,198
Master Shifu strongly
advised us

690
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,788
not to engage.

691
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,473
We've gotta get in there.
But Master Shifu said...

692
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,709
You're seriously afraid?

693
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,758
Even Master Chicken's going
in there! And he's a chicken.

694
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,116
That's it.
I'm going in.

695
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,310
Mantis! We have orders not to...
They need our help!

696
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,351
Come on.
I'll go high, you go low.

697
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,475
No, wait.

698
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,639
Fear the bug!

699
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,319
All right, you little...

700
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,675
Hold on, buddy. I'm coming!

701
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,229
Antenna of Power!
It didn't work!

702
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,435
Mantis!

703
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,631
Your chi is strong.

704
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,639
Just like your friend,

705
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,789
the bug.

706
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,793
Mantis.

707
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,038
Don't worry, little birdie.

708
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,035
I'll put your chi
to good use,

709
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:23,037
destroying the Jade Palace
and everyone in it.

710
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,351
Wings of Regret!

711
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,839
First day of panda training!

712
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,598
All right, flower.

713
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,069
I'm gonna make you bloom.

714
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,355
What? What? What is it?

715
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,280
I'm ready for my first day
of panda training.

716
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,469
What?
You know, learn to be

717
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,516
a panda, master chi,
save the world!

718
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,836
Pandas sleep
till past noon.

719
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,833
So lesson
number one is, "Go back to bed."

720
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,231
Of course!

721
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,876
Nobody said this was
gonna be easy.

722
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,033
Did I oversleep?

723
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,240
You sure did.

724
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,560
Yeah! Show him, kids!

725
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,517
Can you do this?
Can you do that?

726
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,880
How about this?
How about that?

727
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,758
Am I doing it?
Is this good?

728
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,518
I got it!

729
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,760
Grandma Panda, heads up!

730
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,191
We better roll.

731
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,510
Po, lunch time.

732
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,635
You gotta let the hill
tell you where to roll.

733
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,113
Rookie mistake.

734
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:51,636
Dim, Sum, let's show him
how we go uphill!

735
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:54,913
It's beautiful.

736
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,274
Snack time. Po!

737
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,113
You can fly?

738
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,554
I'm coming in hot!

739
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,111
Get them while
they're cold.

740
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,469
What are you doing there?

741
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,232
That food is for Po!

742
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,320
Throw it in!

743
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:15,753
There, there. That's it.

744
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,956
Feeling relaxed?
Totally.

745
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,275
Just let yourself
fall into it.

746
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,440
Got it.

747
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,519
I'm fine.

748
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:30,074
There we go.
Just let it all out.

749
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,639
That's my boy.

750
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,840
Get out of there!

751
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,674
My noodles!

752
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,074
Leave my noodles alone.

753
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,912
Subtle, Po. Very subtle.

754
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,473
Let me get some of that.

755
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,879
Leave my hat alone!

756
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,837
We love noodles!

757
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,035
More noodles!

758
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,679
Just like my Po.

759
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,880
What are you guys looking at?

760
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,712
That's how we roll!
Cannonball!

761
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,673
Here, bring it up here.

762
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,193
Mom, look it!

763
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,194
How was that?

764
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:48,037
Now, you try again.
But don't try so hard.

765
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,269
Okay. Okay.

766
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,551
Much better.

767
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,549
Thanks, Dad.

768
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,229
For what?

769
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,311
You know, just for,
you know,

770
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,231
showing me
what it feels like

771
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:13,519
to be a panda.

772
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,670
So, when do you think
I'll be ready? Ready?

773
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,392
You know, to learn
how to master chi.

774
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,071
Soon. Real soon.

775
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,160
Come on, I wanna
show you something else.

776
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:25,349
Come on.

777
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:32,230
Sorry about the mess.
I don't usually get visitors.

778
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,633
Is this my mom?

779
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:54,551
I had this done
on your 100th day.

780
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,230
Your momma couldn't
hold you still.

781
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,439
You nearly ate
the paper.

782
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,429
It's true.

783
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:05,828
What was she like?

784
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,957
She was the total package.

785
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,276
Smart, beautiful,

786
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:16,595
tremendous appetite.

787
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,631
She was the love
of my life.

788
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:25,199
And then, just when I thought
I couldn't get any luckier,

789
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:26,909
along you came.

790
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,634
My Little Lotus.

791
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,677
I really had it all,

792
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:39,478
until that one moment,

793
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:47,152
when I lost everything.

794
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:29,032
You don't have to worry about
losing me ever again.

795
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,878
Let me get
some of that.

796
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:53,555
It's from
the Eastern Province!

797
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:59,914
Master Lizard, Master Ox,
Master Eagle. All of them.

798
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,597
In every village
from the sea to here,

799
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:05,558
every master in China,

800
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:06,760
has vanished.

801
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,154
Maybe they are
all at a party.

802
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,275
Monkey.

803
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:10,549
I didn't get
invited either.

804
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:12,751
Kai has taken their chi.

805
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:15,388
We are all that stand
between him,

806
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:19,434
and the knowledge
Oogway left in our care.

807
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,552
The villagers, evacuated?

808
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:22,720
Done, Master.

809
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,080
Crane, Mantis?

810
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:25,120
Still nothing.

811
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:26,639
Wait. It's them!

812
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:47,440
Kai.

813
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:53,634
Nice.

814
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,389
Very tacky.

815
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,074
How dare you set foot
on these grounds!

816
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:01,629
Look at you pathetic fools.

817
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:05,839
Groveling at the feet
of Oogway the Magnificent.

818
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,150
You are not fit
to speak his name.

819
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:10,954
I am not fit, little kitten?

820
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,950
I fought by his side.

821
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,948
I loved him like a brother.

822
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:21,789
And he betrayed me.

823
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,834
Now I will destroy
everything he has created!

824
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:31,320
Go!

825
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,233
How's that
for a little kitten?

826
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:13,717
I will not let you
destroy Oogway's memory.

827
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:16,235
Why not? He destroyed mine.

828
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:17,589
Mantis.

829
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,711
It is me, your bestie!

830
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:26,308
Sorry, Tigress!

831
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:45,075
Shifu.

832
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:46,714
Bring them to me.

833
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,515
You must warn Po.

834
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:00,640
Master, please.

835
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:12,759
I will show you the true
power of chi, brother.

836
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:16,115
No.

837
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:55,351
Oogway, forgive me.

838
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:58,752
What do
you say, Oogway?

839
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,592
Do you forgive him?

840
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:03,749
You may have destroyed
the Jade Palace,

841
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,639
but you will never succeed.

842
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:10,634
There will always
be someone to stop you.

843
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,631
Who? The panda?

844
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:14,831
His chi is strong,

845
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:16,635
but it won't be enough.

846
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:21,633
He will meet
the same fate as you.

847
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,158
And so will every panda
in that village.

848
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:33,793
Yes.

849
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:40,675
Po, I hope
you're ready.

850
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,278
Dance, Lotus. Dance.

851
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:50,032
He's so handsome.

852
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:54,753
That's a panda hug!

853
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:40,400
Tigress?

854
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:44,879
Who's she?

855
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:46,189
Who is that?

856
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:49,359
Big Stripy Baby!

857
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:52,080
What are you
doing here?

858
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,912
Kai attacked the Valley.

859
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:55,433
He's taken every
master in China,

860
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:56,760
including Shifu
and the others.

861
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:59,752
It's all gone, Po.
Everything. Everyone.

862
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:00,920
Everyone?

863
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:02,080
Everyone.

864
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,431
How's my restaurant?

865
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,279
We'll talk later.

866
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:08,759
And now he's on his way here.

867
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,433
He's after you, Po.

868
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:13,355
He's after all pandas.

869
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,668
How long do we have?

870
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:15,760
Not long.

871
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,876
Please, tell me
you've mastered chi.

872
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:19,360
Here, take the baby.
Dad! Dad!

873
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:20,600
Okay, who belongs
to this one?

874
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,680
You need to teach me
the secret chi technique now!

875
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:24,910
No, I'm afraid
you need more time.

876
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,238
Everyone, go get your things!
Let me help you with that.

877
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,072
I don't have more time.
I need to learn it now!

878
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:31,071
Sorry, you're not ready.

879
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:32,389
Okay, pack everything!

880
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,079
- I am ready.
- Not quite.

881
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:36,630
What are you talking about?
I've done everything you've asked.

882
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,273
I've mastered napping,
sleeping in,

883
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:39,714
hammocks, hot tubs.

884
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:41,791
I am totally at one
with my panda parts.

885
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:42,955
Now why won't
you show me?

886
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:45,236
Because I don't know it!

887
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:49,480
You what?

888
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,869
I don't know it, okay?
No one does.

889
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:53,149
Maybe we used to.

890
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:55,473
But not anymore.

891
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:56,995
You lied?

892
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,473
Yes.

893
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:03,631
Why?

894
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,398
To save your life!

895
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:08,996
I find out some blade-swinging
maniac is coming for you.

896
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:12,232
What am I supposed to do?
Just let that happen?

897
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:16,837
Yes! I'm the Dragon Warrior.
Facing maniacs, that's my job!

898
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,356
But because of you,
I left the Valley unprotected.

899
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:22,238
I left my friends unprotected!

900
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:23,793
And now they're all...

901
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:25,360
They're all...

902
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:27,277
And you would have been, too.

903
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:30,750
I lost you once.

904
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:33,309
I am not going
to lose you again.

905
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,111
I can't.

906
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:43,359
You just did.

907
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,199
Mom! Pick me!

908
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:05,118
Po, I'm so worried for you

909
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:07,834
that I can't even enjoy
being right about everything.

910
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,798
Now run, run, run, as fast
as those chubby legs can go!

911
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,359
Run? There's
nowhere to run.

912
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:14,158
But what are
you going to do?

913
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:17,073
I'm gonna stay,
and fight that monster.

914
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:20,516
Po, he may be a monster,
but he's still your father.

915
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,193
Not him. Kai!

916
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:10,229
Hungry?

917
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,436
No, not really.

918
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,792
Well, maybe just one.

919
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:19,553
You know, you weren't
the only one who was lying.

920
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:22,034
I didn't really come along

921
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:25,192
because I was worried Po
would go hungry.

922
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:26,872
I was worried about you.

923
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:28,799
Worried that I'd go hungry?

924
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,109
No.

925
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,709
I was worried
you'd steal Po from me.

926
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:33,800
I'd what?

927
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:36,599
I know. That was crazy.

928
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:39,470
But I realize having you

929
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:42,910
in Po's life doesn't
mean less for me.

930
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:45,310
It means more for Po.

931
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,837
Well, I'm not in his life.

932
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,228
Not anymore.

933
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:54,834
Your son got mad at you.

934
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,319
Welcome to parenthood.

935
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:59,517
You don't understand.
I lied to him.

936
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:01,473
He'll never forgive me.

937
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:03,915
I lied to him for 20 years.

938
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:06,150
He still thinks
he came from an egg.

939
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:11,516
Sometimes, we do the wrong
things for the right reasons.

940
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:20,640
Look.

941
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:22,352
He's hurt.

942
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:24,033
He's confused.

943
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:27,758
And he still has
to save the world.

944
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:30,838
He needs both his dads.

945
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:50,793
This isn't going to work.

946
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:51,960
It has to.

947
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:53,109
You're not
thinking straight.

948
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:54,514
I am!
You're not.

949
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:55,680
I am!
No.

950
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:56,840
Yes, I am.
No.

951
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,718
I've seen Kai.

952
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,518
I've seen what he can do.

953
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:02,796
But he hasn't seen
what I can do.

954
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,199
The Wuxi Finger Hold?

955
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:09,920
It's my best move.

956
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:11,399
I just have to get to Kai,

957
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:12,840
grab his finger
and then skadoosh!

958
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:14,478
Back to the Spirit Realm.

959
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:16,357
He has an army
of jade warriors.

960
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:18,317
Everything they see,
he sees.

961
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:19,913
So there's no
sneaking up on him.

962
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:21,080
You will never get

963
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:22,832
close enough.
It's gonna work!

964
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:27,833
He can only be stopped
by a master of chi.

965
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:30,120
You sound just like Shifu
with the, "Chi, chi, chi."

966
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:34,350
I'm not a master
of chi, okay?

967
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:35,839
I don't know if I'm
the Dragon Warrior.

968
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,433
I don't even know
if I'm a panda!

969
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:39,033
I don't know who I am!

970
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:42,840
You're right.

971
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:45,070
There's no way I can
stop him and his army.

972
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,954
Unless you had
an army of your own.

973
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,280
You?

974
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:58,392
Not just me.

975
00:58:58,560 --> 00:58:59,959
Us.

976
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:01,394
All of us.

977
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:14,553
I finally found my son,
after all these years.

978
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:17,748
It's going to take a lot more
than the end of the world

979
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:18,955
to keep us apart.

980
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:21,076
But you don't
even know kung fu.

981
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:23,555
Then you will teach us.

982
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:26,314
What? I can't
teach you kung fu.

983
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:31,554
I couldn't even teach Tigress.
And she already knows kung fu!

984
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:37,075
Po, I know I'm the last guy
you wanna trust right now.

985
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,319
But you gotta believe me.

986
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:41,118
We can do this.

987
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:43,236
We can learn kung fu.

988
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:45,994
We can be just like you!

989
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,080
What did you just say?

990
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:50,679
"We can do this"?
No!

991
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:52,833
"We can learn kung fu"?
After that!

992
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:54,473
"We can be just like you"?

993
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:55,959
Yes!
We can?

994
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:57,678
No! You can't!

995
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:00,513
But you don't have to be!

996
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:03,119
That's what Shifu meant.

997
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:04,838
I don't have to
turn you into me.

998
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:06,353
I have to turn you into you!

999
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,112
That doesn't
make any sense.

1000
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:11,111
I know!

1001
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:12,594
Thanks, Dads.

1002
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:14,034
You're welcome?

1003
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:17,158
I'm gonna do something I never
thought I'd be able to do.

1004
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:19,515
I'm gonna teach kung fu.

1005
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:24,034
You guys, your real strength
comes from being

1006
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,200
the best "you" you can be.

1007
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:26,554
So who are you?

1008
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:28,039
<i>What are you good at?</i>

1009
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:29,553
<i>What do you love?</i>

1010
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:30,789
<i>What makes you, "you"?</i>

1011
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:36,630
Yes, good. Good. Again.

1012
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:40,868
Good. Again.

1013
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:43,392
Good, good, good. Again.

1014
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:47,190
Stripy Baby! Stripy Baby!

1015
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,994
Faster, faster!
Twirl those ribbons!

1016
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:52,388
Hug that log, you!

1017
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:54,152
Hug that log
like it's the last time

1018
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:56,071
you're ever gonna hug it
goodbye forever.

1019
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:57,912
Higher! And a little more
to the left this time.

1020
01:00:58,040 --> 01:00:59,040
You can do it!

1021
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,674
I don't wanna see any of
these hit the ground!

1022
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:17,996
Wait, wait, Stripy Baby!

1023
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:20,555
Good! Try it with this.

1024
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:24,749
Now try it with these!

1025
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:30,910
Good! Now try
it with these.

1026
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:07,039
They are ready.

1027
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,193
What?

1028
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:13,795
Okay, pay attention because
I'm only gonna go over this

1029
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:15,148
10 more times.

1030
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:18,073
The only entrance
to the village is here.

1031
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:20,549
The dumpling squadron
will take position here,

1032
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:23,234
while the cookie squadron
will take position here.

1033
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:25,834
Now, on my signal,
the two squadrons will...

1034
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:29,759
Right, okay.

1035
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:31,672
The noodle squadron will...

1036
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:38,990
Okay. Anyway,
the important thing to remember

1037
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:40,513
is that this
is the spot where...

1038
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:45,158
Okay, I saw that coming.

1039
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:46,839
If you only remember
one thing,

1040
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:48,313
it's distract the jombies

1041
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:51,313
until I get close enough to
put a Wuxi Finger Hold on Kai.

1042
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:52,993
- You got it?
- Yeah!

1043
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:56,350
Pandas on three!
One, two three, Pan...

1044
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:59,956
You guys... Never mind,
I'll teach you that later.

1045
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:38,392
I wish I could have
taught you this, son.

1046
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:40,312
It's okay, Dad. I'm...

1047
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,558
He's here.

1048
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:17,589
That's what I call
a Dramatic Entrance!

1049
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:24,554
You must be
the Dragon Warrior.

1050
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:27,359
And you must be Kai!

1051
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:29,954
Beast of Vengeance,
Maker of Widows!

1052
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:34,430
Yes! Finally! Thank you!

1053
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:36,437
Almost makes me wanna
spare your life.

1054
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:37,959
You wanna spare me?

1055
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:40,270
How about you spare me
the chit-chat?

1056
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:42,231
All right? Let's do this.

1057
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:44,396
I'm going to take your chi,

1058
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:47,199
then the chi
of every panda in the...

1059
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:48,469
Chit-chat!

1060
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:50,073
In this...
Chitty-chitty chat-chat.

1061
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:51,554
In...
Chat, chat, chat.

1062
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:53,548
In the...
Chit-chat!

1063
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:56,313
You pudgy little...

1064
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:02,597
Round them all up.

1065
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:18,316
It's true.

1066
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:20,436
You guys have all been
turned green!

1067
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:23,518
Except for you, Mantis.
You were already green.

1068
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:26,794
Now?
Wait for the signal.

1069
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:30,595
Here we go!

1070
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:42,635
Dumpling Squad!

1071
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:44,518
Ready?
Go time!

1072
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:46,352
Belly!
Gong!

1073
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:51,040
Seriously?

1074
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:52,360
We did it!

1075
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:54,588
Sorry, Crane.

1076
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:05,200
Spring Roll Squad!
Time for some takeout!

1077
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:15,553
Over here, Mr. Jombie!

1078
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:23,197
I don't know who
you are, either.

1079
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:24,560
Noodle Squad!

1080
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:29,798
Get ready to dance

1081
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,479
with danger!

1082
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:36,754
Sweet!

1083
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:49,749
Stripy Baby!

1084
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:57,038
Do it.
You're mean!

1085
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:04,194
Fire!

1086
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:10,955
Fire in the hole!

1087
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:13,509
Yes!

1088
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:15,272
All right, kids!

1089
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:16,793
You got it, guys!

1090
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:24,720
I can't hit Shifu!

1091
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:27,955
I can!

1092
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:29,792
And so can I.

1093
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:33,113
Double-Dad Defense!

1094
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:34,549
Left, Dad!
Right, Dad!

1095
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:35,720
Thanks, Dad!

1096
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:37,074
Back at you, Dad.

1097
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:38,793
We've got this, son!

1098
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:40,709
Go, Dads!

1099
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:47,989
We got them now.

1100
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:50,992
Stop! Enough!

1101
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:54,275
Get out...

1102
01:07:58,400 --> 01:07:59,799
Let's finish this.

1103
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:02,920
That's our boy!

1104
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:21,512
Sorry, buddy. Gotta send you
back to the Spirit Realm.

1105
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:22,749
Skadoosh!

1106
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:27,752
Okay, that didn't work.
Let me try one more time.

1107
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:31,515
Skadoosh! Skadoosh. Skadoosh.
Skadoo... What the...

1108
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:33,591
Hold on, wait!
It's working.

1109
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:42,596
No, it's not.

1110
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:44,438
Did Oogway teach you
that little trick?

1111
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:46,314
Too bad.

1112
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:48,550
It only works on mortals.

1113
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:52,474
And I am a Spirit Warrior.

1114
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:53,629
Come!

1115
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:45,554
I was wrong.

1116
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:48,188
I'm sorry. Run.

1117
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:02,233
So, Oogway,

1118
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:06,188
this was the one
destined to stop me?

1119
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:08,510
I will have his chi,

1120
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:11,269
and then all of theirs!

1121
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:29,154
And you...

1122
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:34,234
You really thought you could send
me back to the Spirit Realm?

1123
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:42,396
You are just a stupid mortal.

1124
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:45,631
It only works on mortals.

1125
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:50,236
You're right.
I can't send you there.

1126
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:52,994
But I can take you there.

1127
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:54,720
What's that?

1128
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:57,229
What?

1129
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:01,119
Skadoosh.

1130
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:27,714
What happened?

1131
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:28,880
Where's Po?

1132
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:32,636
He took Kai away.
He saved us.

1133
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:38,717
He saved us,
but who's saving him?

1134
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,995
The Spirit Realm. It worked!

1135
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:49,360
Get off me, you...

1136
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:52,394
You brought me back?

1137
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:55,474
Don't blame me. I tried to finish
this in the regular realm.

1138
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:57,710
Then we'll finish it here!

1139
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:34,631
Come on, son. Fight!

1140
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:43,278
We have to help him.

1141
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,069
We have to help him!

1142
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:46,400
Okay. Everyone gather around.

1143
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:48,635
That's it. Come in close.
Come on.

1144
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:50,478
We can do this.

1145
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:02,951
You taught us who
we were meant to be.

1146
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:08,710
A father.

1147
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:13,839
A friend.

1148
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:15,634
A dumpling kicker.

1149
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:17,358
A lethal fighting machine.

1150
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:18,748
A hugger.

1151
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:22,597
A nunchuck chick.

1152
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:24,916
Stripy Baby.

1153
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:27,439
A family.

1154
01:13:57,280 --> 01:13:58,474
Sweet!

1155
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:15,434
Who are you?

1156
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:17,989
I've been asking
the same question.

1157
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:24,278
Am I the son of a panda?

1158
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:26,198
The son of a goose?

1159
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:27,429
A student?

1160
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:29,594
A teacher?

1161
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:32,279
Turns out,

1162
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,115
I'm all of them.

1163
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:46,475
I am the Dragon Warrior.

1164
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:49,595
Get it? See the giant dragon?

1165
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:53,311
Get ready to feel the thunder.

1166
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:55,558
This is awesome!

1167
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:22,640
Belly Gong.

1168
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:25,514
Butt Slap.

1169
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:29,715
Perhaps a bit of lunch.

1170
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:30,989
Because I'm starving.

1171
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:51,840
Let's do this!

1172
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:57,560
Heads up!

1173
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:16,479
It took me 500 years
to take Oogway's chi.

1174
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:20,076
I will have yours
if it takes me 500 more.

1175
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:21,355
Chitty-chitty chat-chat.

1176
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:35,911
You want my chi so bad,

1177
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:37,469
then take it.

1178
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:45,839
Yes.

1179
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,594
The power is mine.

1180
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:53,628
Wait. No. It's too much.

1181
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:56,030
That's too much! No!

1182
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:15,158
Where did he go?

1183
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:24,272
We're back!

1184
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:25,360
Bestie!

1185
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:27,032
I'm still green!
It didn't work!

1186
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:29,037
Wait.
That's my normal green.

1187
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:30,519
Greeny Baby!

1188
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:32,796
Not a baby.
Not a baby!

1189
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,228
Antenna of Fear!

1190
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:36,079
What about Po?

1191
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:37,160
Have you seen Po?

1192
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:38,918
No. He's not here?

1193
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:44,037
Why isn't he back?

1194
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:56,271
Dragon Warrior.

1195
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:58,596
Oogway?

1196
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:03,112
I can't believe it.

1197
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:06,233
You are extra shiny.

1198
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:07,400
As are you.

1199
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:09,357
I know, right?
It's like the best cape ever.

1200
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:11,670
When I run with it,
then it looks really cool.

1201
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:14,035
It suits you.
You've grown.

1202
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:16,111
I gotta lay off
the panda buffet.

1203
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:18,350
Grown up,

1204
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:20,553
as I hoped you would

1205
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:23,279
when I sent the message
to your father.

1206
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:26,591
You sent
the universe mail.

1207
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:27,800
Yes.

1208
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:30,993
Because the universe
needed you.

1209
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:33,037
Me?

1210
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:37,877
You finally became the panda
you were always meant to be.

1211
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:40,076
But, how'd you know I could?

1212
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:42,549
On the first day we met,

1213
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:46,030
I saw the future of kung fu.

1214
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:50,511
<i>And the past.</i>

1215
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:56,749
<i>I saw the panda
who could unite them both.</i>

1216
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:59,749
<i>That is why I chose you, Po.</i>

1217
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:03,477
Both sides of a Yin and Yang.

1218
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:08,474
And my true successor.

1219
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:13,120
Me? I can't take that.

1220
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:14,713
Just take it.

1221
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:16,358
I have a bigger one.

1222
01:19:18,240 --> 01:19:21,550
I mean, you're enlightened
and everything. I'm just...

1223
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:25,040
Really?

1224
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:26,599
Yes.

1225
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:38,233
Now what do we do?

1226
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:40,510
You tell me.

1227
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:43,431
No. Oogway, don't go!

1228
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:47,070
I'm not going anywhere.
I live here.

1229
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:48,559
Right.

1230
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:53,633
It's you who must decide
whether to stay or go.

1231
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:55,677
Wait. I can go back?

1232
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:58,832
Who knows?
I've never tried.

1233
01:20:27,680 --> 01:20:29,511
You can fly!

1234
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:45,078
Don't you go disappearing
in petals ever again.

1235
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:46,832
We thought we lost you.

1236
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:48,917
No, you saved me.

1237
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:50,840
You all did.

1238
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:54,957
Now, come on over here!

1239
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:56,838
Hugs!

1240
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:01,799
Master Shifu!

1241
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:05,118
The student has
truly become the tea...

1242
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:06,519
Wait. Where did
you get that?

1243
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:09,831
This. Oogway gave it
to me in the Spirit Realm.

1244
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:12,151
Of course he did.

1245
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:14,276
I think I mastered chi.

1246
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:18,112
Of course you did.

1247
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:21,470
Can you teach me?

1248
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:25,754
Ready!

1249
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:55,678
Monkey, help me!

1250
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:57,273
Greeny Baby!

1251
01:21:57,440 --> 01:21:58,440
Get 'em off me!

1252
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:18,668
Skadoosh.

1253
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:28,237
Panda asthma.

1254
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:20,955
<i>Everybody was kung fu fighting.</i>

1255
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:25,872
<i>Our chi is what we're finding.</i>

1256
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:29,993
<i>I know it's
a little bit frightening.</i>

1257
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:34,317
<i>But it's so enlightening.</i>

1258
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:39,959
<i>Before the battle of the fist
comes the battle of the mind.</i>
