1
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,278
<i>Antarctica.</i>

2
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,639
<i>An inhospitable wasteland.</i>

3
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,516
<i>But even here,
on the earth's frozen bottom...</i>

4
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,671
<i>we find life.</i>

5
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,833
<i>And not just any life.</i>

6
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,992
<i>Penguins!</i>

7
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,194
<i>Joyous, frolicking, waddling,
cute and cuddly life.</i>

8
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,040
<i>Look at them...</i>

9
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,476
<i>tumbling onto their chubby bum-bums.</i>

10
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,280
<i>Who could take these
frisky little snow clowns...</i>

11
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,635
Seriously?

12
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,076
Does anyone even know
where we're marching to?

13
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,197
- Who cares?
- I question nothing.

14
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,350
- Me, too.
- Me, too!

15
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,316
Well, fine!

16
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:43,279
We'll just fly to the front of the line
and see for ourselves.

17
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,512
Kowalski! Rico!
Engage aerial surveillance.

18
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,198
Here we go! Doing it! Come on!

19
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,397
Skipper, we appear to be flightless.

20
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,834
Well, what's the point of these?

21
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,873
I like it! Hey, this could be our thing!

22
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,470
What are we gonna call it?
Let's call it the "high one."

23
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,630
Hey, did anybody see that?
That's an egg!

24
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,870
Is someone gonna go get it?

25
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,189
We can't do that.

26
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,156
Why not?

27
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,950
Well, it's a dangerous world out there,
and we're just penguins.

28
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,191
You know, nothing but cute and cuddly.

29
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,796
Yeah! Why do you think there are always
documentary crews filming us?

30
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,114
Well, sorry, kid.
We lose a few eggs every year.

31
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,315
It's just nature.

32
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,357
Oh, right. Nature.

33
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,511
I guess that makes sense...

34
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:41,759
but something deep down in my gut
tells me that it makes no sense at all.

35
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,389
You know what? I reject nature!

36
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,072
Who's with me?

37
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,158
The old ship.
No one's ever returned from there alive.

38
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,589
Relax, Kowalski.
There's a bird down there now.

39
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,989
Look, he's fine.

40
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,920
Leopard seals. Nature's snakes.

41
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,832
Aren't snakes "nature's snakes"?

42
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,719
How should I know?
I live on the flipping frozen tundra!

43
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,234
They're going for the egg!
Give me a way down there, ASAP!

44
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,153
All one would have to do
is collect 300 feet of kelp...

45
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:02,078
Tiny and helpless,
the baby penguins are frozen with fear.

46
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,757
They know if they fall from this cliff,
they will surely die.

47
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,435
Gunter, give them a shove.

48
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,240
...harnessing the jellyfish we've trained
to obey simple voice commands.

49
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,914
Now, that's more like it!

50
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,549
That-a-boy, Rico!

51
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,119
Don't let them have it!

52
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,277
Okay! I guess that works.

53
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,719
Get to high ground!

54
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,595
BOOyah!

55
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,875
Success!

56
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,194
I'd recommend firing it now!

57
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,316
Nope. Hold on.

58
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,550
We really should fire it!

59
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,711
Not till we see the white of its eyes.

60
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,951
They're mostly pupil.
Very little white! Almost none!

61
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,713
They got to have a little bit of white,
right?

62
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,597
None whatsoever!

63
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,877
What if they look really far
to the left?

64
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,029
Fire in the hole!

65
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,554
Kowalski, analysis?

66
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,238
We are really awesome at this!

67
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,469
Boys, we did it! Mission accomplished.

68
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,359
Hey, we could do our thing!
High one!

69
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,395
Yes!

70
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,550
My bad!

71
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,710
Look, it's the miracle of birth!

72
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,760
A moment of extraordinary beauty.

73
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,679
That's disgusting!
I think I have amniotic sac in my mouth!

74
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,079
Hello! Are you my family?

75
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,435
You don't have a family,
and we're all going to die. Sorry.

76
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,431
What?

77
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,794
What? I thought that was what
we were all nodding about.

78
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,758
No one's gonna die!

79
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,955
Know what you've got, kid?

80
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,434
You've got us.

81
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,273
We've got each other.

82
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,718
If that ain't a family,
I don't know what is.

83
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,638
So adorable.

84
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,916
Kowalski, what's our trajectory?

85
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,037
95% certain we're still doomed.

86
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,952
And the other 5%?

87
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,636
Adventure and glory
like no penguins have ever seen before.

88
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,154
I'll take that action.

89
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,549
But where are we going?

90
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,399
The future, boys.

91
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,514
The glorious future.

92
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,509
That song!

93
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,115
I swear, it's gonna make me
lose my salmon.

94
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,714
Singing getting louder, Skipper.

95
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,156
Then move faster!

96
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,675
And somebody get that wig off Private!

97
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,319
Kowalski, status report!

98
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,312
I am really getting tired of this song.

99
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,357
Well, the best part
of owning a circus...

100
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,392
ls you can transport a cannon
over state lines.

101
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,314
Ten years ago, on this very day,
a tiny egg hatched...

102
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,040
and our world got a little bit cuter.

103
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,474
So, tonight, Private,
we celebrate your birthday...

104
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,678
by infiltrating
the United States gold depository...

105
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,429
at Fort Knox!

106
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,556
Splendid!

107
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,950
- What?
- There she is, boys!

108
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,430
The object of our unholy desire...

109
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,874
the butter on our biscuit...

110
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,155
-the royal flush...
- Skipper?

111
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,914
Private, what's our rule
about interrupting analogies?

112
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,354
Sorry. Please continue.

113
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,636
The moment's gone. Private ruined it.

114
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,234
Sir, we're approaching our target.

115
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,076
But, Skipper, I really don't--

116
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,151
Are you questioning
my leadership, Private?

117
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,072
- No, sir.
- Too bad.

118
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,190
Because I respect a soldier
with some moxie.

119
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,549
Really? Then I really think we should--

120
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:40,315
Whoa, whoa!
Dial back the moxie, sass-mouth!

121
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,916
Look at you. Still so adorable.

122
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,590
Fire in the hole!

123
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,990
<i>Eight o'clock. Night-night time!</i>

124
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,275
What?

125
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,473
Private, come on!

126
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,354
<i>Please enter passcode.</i>

127
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,715
Kowalski, you're up.

128
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,549
<i>Please enter passcode.</i>

129
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,439
Rico, sonic incursion device.

130
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,039
Oh, come on. You're kidding, right?

131
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,431
Kentucky, Skipper.
They do love their Flatt and Scruggs.

132
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,234
<i>Y'all come in now, you hear?
Have yourself an ice tea.</i>

133
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,834
Private, if you could have anything
you wanted in the whole wide world...

134
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,115
what would it be?

135
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,076
Well, gee, Skipper.

136
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,959
I think to be a meaningful
and valued member of this team.

137
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,633
Oh, well, we got you something else.

138
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,316
A vending machine?

139
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,278
Not just any vending machine, Private.

140
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,751
The last remaining home
in America's nanny state...

141
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:07,596
for those succulent, but chemically
hazardous bits of puffed heaven called--

142
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,313
Cheezy Dibbles!

143
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,598
Happy ding-dong birthday,
you little scamp.

144
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,074
Thank you!

145
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,871
You mess with the bull,
you're gonna get the horns, Private.

146
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,600
Now hit that machine
and get your present.

147
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:35,238
We just broke into the most secure facility
in North America.

148
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,515
You know what that means?

149
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,194
We're wanted criminals who'll be on the I am
the rest of our lives...

150
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,158
always feeling the hot breath
of Johnny Law on our necks?

151
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:46,396
No! It means, as elite units go,
we're the elitist of the elite.

152
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,633
Top shelf in the bureau.
The penultimate, plus one.

153
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,914
Where'd Private go?

154
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,873
There he is. D-3.

155
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,872
Oh, Private. How much is he?

156
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,713
He's $3.50, sir.

157
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,440
That's outrageous. Even for Private.

158
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,830
Sir, the machine is alive!

159
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,758
I don't think I like your attitude,
vending machine.

160
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,069
Or your prices!

161
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,355
Release them!

162
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,076
What the--?

163
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,030
Kowalski, analysis!

164
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,350
All evidence indicates...

165
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,391
late too many Cheezy Dibbles.

166
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,792
We're behind enemy lines
and incredibly thirsty.

167
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,679
Rico, bust us out
of this delicious prison.

168
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,751
Nice work, Rico!

169
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,316
You are a meaningful
and valued member of this team.

170
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,957
Private, quit lollygagging.
And regular gagging.

171
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,478
Dark and ominous.

172
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,029
Two of my least favorite traits
in a room.

173
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,310
Look! A button.

174
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,550
Private, don't!

175
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,279
Now, what have I told you about--

176
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,510
Sorry, what?

177
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,871
It looks like some sort of giant laser
sent to kill us all, sir.

178
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:23,952
Another one!

179
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,071
No!

180
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:28,991
What the--?

181
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,434
Naughty, naughty!

182
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,755
Pretty birds belong in their cages.

183
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,594
Now, that's just hurtful.

184
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,637
And I was so happy to see you again.

185
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:02,311
Skipper, Kowalski, Rico...

186
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,835
and sweet little Private.

187
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,274
Who are you?

188
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,637
The humans know me
as Doctor Octavius Brine...

189
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,714
renowned geneticist,
cheese enthusiast...

190
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,430
and frequent donor to NPR pledge drives.

191
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,754
But you know me by a different,
much older name.

192
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,914
A name perhaps you'd hoped
you'd never hear again.

193
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,195
A phantom!

194
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,399
A shadow of a former life.

195
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,670
I...

196
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,636
am...

197
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,191
Dave!

198
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,196
Kowalski?

199
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,919
Sorry, sir. No clue.

200
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,993
Dave!

201
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,275
Dave!

202
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,351
- Dave!
- Dave?

203
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,635
Dave!

204
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,710
Dave.

205
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,995
Dave!

206
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,349
Sorry.

207
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,558
Wait, wait. I live this way.

208
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,520
Go ahead, Dan. Continue.

209
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,240
You seriously don't remember me?

210
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,709
Dave! Dave! Right! Oh, yeah, long time!

211
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,715
How's the wife?

212
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,871
I've never been married!

213
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,391
You may not remember me

214
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,120
but I could never forget you.

215
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,115
Let's shake up some old memories.

216
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,916
New York City.

217
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,674
<i>The Central Park Zoo. Life was good.</i>

218
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,195
<i>Roomy tank...</i>

219
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,039
<i>great location...</i>

220
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,750
<i>monkey-house views.</i>

221
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,475
<i>And, of course...</i>

222
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,236
<i>my adoring legion of fans!</i>

223
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,231
Cool!

224
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,390
<i>Dave!</i>

225
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,598
<i>The octopus of a thousand tricks.</i>

226
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,556
Awesome!

227
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,631
<i>I was the total package.</i>

228
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,551
Wow!

229
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,278
Hey. kids!

230
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,511
You got to see this! Get up here, quick!

231
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,678
<i>And then, you arrived.</i>

232
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,951
They're so adorable!

233
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,238
Just smile and wave, boys.
Smile and wave.

234
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,994
<i>And took everything from me.</i>

235
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,512
- They are so adorable.
- Have you ever seen anything cuter?

236
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,714
<i>Four adorable baby penguins.</i>

237
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,950
<i>With you around...</i>

238
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,238
<i>no one wanted an old octopus anymore.</i>

239
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,836
<i>"Out you go, Dave!"</i>

240
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,514
<i>And so it went, over and over...</i>

241
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,955
<i>at zoo after aquarium.</i>

242
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,633
I can't see the penguins, man!

243
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,950
<i>Adorable penguins stole the show.</i>

244
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,198
<i>While I was shunned.</i>

245
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,999
<i>Forgotten.</i>

246
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,159
<i>Unwanted.</i>

247
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,433
Alone.

248
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,836
That sounds awful!

249
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,116
Oh, it was.

250
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:15,077
I came to realize, some creatures
are born to get all the love.

251
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,800
The rest of us get nothing.

252
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,793
The only thing that has kept me going
all these years...

253
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:25,193
is my burning thirst for revenge!

254
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,360
And my precious
souvenir snow globe collection.

255
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,838
What is wrong with you?

256
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,437
Daryl, Daryl, Daryl, you can't blame us
for what happened to you.

257
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:47,553
Can!
That's how this whole revenge thing works!

258
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:52,476
And with this,
I finally have the power to destroy you!

259
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,789
Crikey!

260
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,670
Nicolas, cage them.

261
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,715
I've got some bad news for you, Dennis.

262
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,518
You messed with the wrong birds.

263
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,798
Because we are an elite unit,
the best of the best.

264
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,917
The cream of the corn on a platinum cob!

265
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,916
And we're gonna take your deadly green
goop and sashay right out the exit hatch.

266
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,913
And just how are you going to do that?

267
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,072
Deploy secret weapon!

268
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,599
The cheese, it burns!

269
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,429
Roll out!

270
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,634
After them!

271
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,834
All right, boys, it's just like Cuba!

272
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,718
Taxi!

273
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,789
How about some music? Something chase-y!

274
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,556
Here they come!

275
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,515
Let's move!

276
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,798
Stroke! Stroke! Stroke again!
Stroke some more!

277
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,597
Stroke! Stroke! Stroke!

278
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,512
Sorry!

279
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,479
We've got baddies, six o'clock!

280
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,751
Kowalski, battle formation!

281
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,955
So, you squeegees
wanna do the gondola mambo?

282
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,836
Let's dance!

283
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,120
Mother of pearl, that stings!
I've lost visual!

284
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,480
Kowalski, be my eyes!

285
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,357
Left!

286
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,352
Right, right! Up!

287
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,955
Duck!

288
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:38,836
I think I got them.

289
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,235
They are down, sir.

290
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,720
<i>Excelente!</i>

291
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,477
Skipper!

292
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,075
They're back up,
and we are running out of canal!

293
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,833
<i>Parker Pusey! Go all-terrain.</i>

294
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,760
Will you marry-- What?

295
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,869
We've lost Engine One!

296
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,234
And Two and Three!

297
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:11,958
Four!

298
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,874
Switch to emergency power!

299
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,360
AVE-Bye, Skipper!

300
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,357
We've got melons! Dead ahead!

301
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,474
I can see! Rico, the glowy thing!

302
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,035
Venetian blinded again!

303
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,271
We've been boarded!

304
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,669
Initiate self-destruct sequence!

305
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:51,797
Nice!

306
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,270
Frankly, I'm surprised
we had a self-destruct sequence.

307
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,029
All right, boys, battle stance!

308
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,191
We're in battle stance, sir.

309
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:13,154
Okay, good. Now, we spring our trap.

310
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,469
I'm not sure they're the ones
that are trapped, sir.

311
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,474
Kowalski, remember our little talk about
true, but unhelpful, comments?

312
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,471
Yes, sir.

313
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,596
Sometimes we just have to wing it!

314
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,556
Wow.

315
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,794
Sorry for underestimating
the plan, Skipper.

316
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,112
It's okay, Kowalski.
Just don't ever doubt me again.

317
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,953
Now what the heck is going on?

318
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,954
Remain calm, penguins.

319
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,310
You are now under the protection
of the North Wind.

320
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,199
You're welcome.

321
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,599
Oh. my gosh!

322
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,957
You guys are so cute!

323
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,554
You're just so cute!

324
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,917
And cuddly!

325
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,356
Hey. get away! No more hugs!

326
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,909
It's like being licked
by a basket full of puppy dogs.

327
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,596
Corporal!

328
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:26,151
Corporal! Chart a course
back to North Wind headquarters.

329
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,596
Eva, inform them
that we're bringing in witnesses.

330
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,671
Private, Dibble me.

331
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,789
We're not going anywhere with you.

332
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,236
We don't even know who the heck you are!

333
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,471

339

Dedicated to helping--

340
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,871
Dedicated to helping animals who can't
help themselves.

341
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,474
Like penguins.

342
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,159
Really? And you are?

343
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,316
My name is classified.

344
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,154
"Classified," eh? What is that, Dutch?

345
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,390
Can't really hear the accent.

346
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,880
- Excuse me?
- There's the accent!

347
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,360
My name isn't "Classified."

348
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,150
My name is classified,
because I am the leader of this strike team.

349
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,709
The seal is Short Fuse,
weapons and explosives.

350
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,837
The bear is Corporal, he's our muscle.

351
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,799
And the owl is Eva,
intelligence and analysis.

352
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,874
Well, Agent Classified,
we happen to be an elite unit, too.

353
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,917
<i>Self-destruct sequence activated.</i>

354
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,832
You know,
you should really label these things.

355
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,718
<i>In three... two... one--</i>

356
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,636
The name's Skipper. I run this outfit.

357
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,029
Back there is Kowalski.

358
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,952
He's the brains of our operation.

359
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,440
Say something smart, Kowalski.

360
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,109
See?
He's working on a whole other level.

361
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,190
And Rico.

362
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,794
He's our demolition expert.

363
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,073
He destroyed that chair
for the sheer fun of it.

364
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,389
No reason at all.

365
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,358
And then there's Private.

366
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,351
He's sort of our, you know...

367
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,431
<i>secretary/mascot.</i>

368
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,757
- Cute.
- And cuddly.

369
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,720
Oh, sorry.

370
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,440
Well, let's see how well
"cute and cuddly" handles this next bit.

371
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,192
Nice doggy door.

372
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,393
Wow!

373
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,474
Look at this!

374
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,278
Well, well, well.

375
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,000
Not a bad place
you got here, Classified.

376
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,992
Thank you. That's not my name.

377
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,430
<i>Arrival, Pad 17.</i>

378
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,791
All right, tiny penguins.

379
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,669
The best way for the North Wind
to protect helpless animals like yourselves...

380
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,319
is to bring Dr. Brine to justice.

381
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,550
Now, you were inside his sub...

382
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,677
so I need to know everything you know.

383
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,471
Hey!

384
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,314
Just tell me everything you know.

385
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,390
All right.

386
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,436
<i>Numero uno.</i>

387
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,838
Never trust a Dutchman in a tulip fight.

388
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,070
"Tulip fight."

389
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,151
Canada is secretly training
an army of sasquatch.

390
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:17,957
"Sasquatch."

391
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:21,158
Hot dogs are, in fact,
only 17% actual dog.

392
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,030
Not "everything" everything!

393
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,830
Just everything regarding your abduction
by Dr. Octavius Brine.

394
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,599
- Why didn't you say so?
- What?

395
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,354
My team has uncovered
that Dr. Octavius Brine...

396
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,160
is actually an individual
known as Derek!

397
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,596
-"Dave".
- As Dave, the octopus.

398
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,034
An octopus?

399
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,794
No, Dr. Brine is not an octopus.
He is--

400
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,837
An octopus. Precisely.

401
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,879
That's exactly what our intel indicated.

402
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,156
Release the sheep.

403
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,789
What you, of course,
could not know...

404
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:58,397
is that Dr. Brine's laboratory in Venice
is secretly developing a doomsday weapon...

405
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,518
called the "Medusa Serum."

406
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,400
But what you don't know...

407
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,675
-is that Dirk...
-"Dave."

408
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,070
...Dave won't be using his
Bazooka Serum...

409
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,470
-"Medusa Serum."
-...Medusa Serum on anybody.

410
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,550
That part is accurate.

411
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,199
Show him, Rico!

412
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,391
You stole the Medusa Serum?

413
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,757
Well, "Stole the serum,"
"Saved the day," "Did your job for you."

414
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,399
Call it what you will.

415
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:25,837
Debbie!

416
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,399
-"Dave."
- Dave!

417
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,120
He hacked into our system.

418
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,635
Where's the sound?

419
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,635
Dave!

420
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,473
- Your microphone, it's not on.
- I can't hear anything.

421
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,119
Click on the button
with the picture of the microphone.

422
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,078
Every time a villain calls in,
this happens.

423
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,435
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

424
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,432
Now we can hear you,
but we cannot see you.

425
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,396
Every time!

426
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,630
It's like talking to my parents.

427
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,069
<i>How about now?</i>

428
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,109
Yes, we've got you.

429
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,953
<i>Excellent. Now where was I?</i>

430
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,674
Dave!

431
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,153
<i>Greetings, North Wind.</i>

432
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,709
<i>I see you've met my old zoo-mates.</i>

433
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,759
We were never "mates."
There was no mating.

434
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,354
Turn yourself in, David.

435
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,399
You're powerless now that I've stolen
your precious Medusa Serum.

436
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,550
You? You didn't steal that!

437
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,676
It's over.

438
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,239
<i>It's over?</i>

439
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,597
<i>Then why did I call you?</i>

440
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,909
<i>Weird.</i>

441
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:18,277
<i>Oh! Maybe it was to show you this!</i>

442
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,434
That is a lot of serum
for four penguins.

443
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,276
<i>Oh, you thought
this was just about you four?</i>

444
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,511
<i>No! No, no, no.</i>

445
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,830
<i>We're just getting started.</i>

446
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:35,596
<i>Now, if you'll excuse me,
[have to go do some shopping...</i>

447
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,558
<i>for revenge!</i>

448
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,592
<i>Wait. How do you...7</i>

449
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,510
<i>What do I push?</i>

450
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,793
<i>Is it the red, or...</i>

451
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,078
<i>I thought it was the... It's not this--</i>

452
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,596
Incoming alert!

453
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,591
Put it on the screen.

454
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,710
The Berlin Zoo. 15 penguins missing.

455
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,439
Dave is kidnapping other penguins!

456
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,477
No doubt cute and cuddly!

457
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,596
We have to move!

458
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,352
What?

459
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,999
- Time for our A-game!
- Everybody, huddle up!

460
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,275
Corporal, ready the jet.

461
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,193
I'm initiating
North Wind Protocol "Zeta

462
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,278
Twelve more penguins
taken from London Zoo.

463
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,477
Okay, boys, this is it.

464
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:16,553
The mission we've been preparing for
our entire lives.

465
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,280
We're gonna take down Dave,
or die trying!

466
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,113
- Kowalski, cancel our lmprov class!
- Yes, sir.

467
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,475
Rico, equip"?!

468
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,199
Private, do that little thing I like.

469
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,830
It's still funny.

470
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,149
Skipper! Good news!

471
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,152
I got them to credit our class!

472
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,719
Sir, the jet is ready.

473
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,394
Oh, yeah, baby!
Just like Super Bowl XIX!

474
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,880
They're stealing my stuff!

475
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:40,070
No! This mission has no place
for a pathetic waddle of useless penguins.

476
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,196
Who are you calling "pathetic"?

477
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,156
Enough!

478
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:48,198
See, Rico?
That's why you can't have nice things.

479
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:53,510
You know,
I'm pretty good with computers myself.

480
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,829
Put on your jammies, penguin.

481
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,352
They are even cute when they're asleep.

482
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,316
Not to me!

483
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,792
I want these butterballs out of my way,
and out of my mission.

484
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,519
Ship them to one of our safe-houses.

485
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,718
The most remote place on the planet.

486
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,638
Where the heck are we?

487
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,155
Oxygen content is low.

488
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,277
I suggest we limit our breathing.

489
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:32,996
Private!

490
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,157
Sorry! I get gassy when I fly.

491
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,355
Toot sweet! He does!

492
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,874
We must be on a plane!

493
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,270
What did North Wind do to us?

494
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,558
They gave us badges!

495
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,318
Not badges, tranquilizer darts!

496
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,879
Classified!

497
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:56,112
That low-down dirty dog
is trying to kick us off the mission!

498
00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:00,114
He thinks we can't save the penguins,
because we're just "penguins."

499
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:03,477
Well, penguins are our flesh and feathers!
They're us!

500
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,677
And if anyone's gonna save us...

501
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,671
it's us.

502
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,400
But, Skipper,
we've got to be five miles up.

503
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,119
That pretty much limits our options.

504
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,237
I make my own options.

505
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,634
Brilliant move, Skipper.

506
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,757
But now we seem to be outside the plane.

507
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,991
I kind of got caught up in the moment!

508
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,117
Well, hindsight's 20/20.

509
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:30,432
Okay, Kowalski,
your turn to pick up the slack.

510
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,555
Oh! Why don't we catch that plane?

511
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,799
Bird strike, log it.

512
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,356
We've got another target, at 12 o'clock.

513
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,954
Good, it's only 11:30.

514
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:45,158
Follow me, boys, we're going in hot!

515
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,798
Hot, hot!

516
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,792
No one likes a showoff, Private.

517
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,359
Aim for first class!

518
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,750
I'm okay!

519
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,351
Kowalski, where does this aircraft go?

520
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,592
From the odd shape of this bagel,
I'd say we're headed for Paris.

521
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,320
France? Forget .
Not with their tax laws!

522
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,278
Then I would suggest a mid-air transfer.

523
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,316
Affirmative!

524
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,153
Peanuts! Peanuts! Peanuts!

525
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,435
We're out of peanuts, Skipper!

526
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,715
Try pretzels, Private.

527
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,835
Bingo!

528
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,479
There's our ride, boys.

529
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,153
Can't stay, doll.

530
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,357
Danger is my mistress.

531
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,029
Rico, more height!

532
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,677
Pretzels, pretzels, pretzels!

533
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,750
We're out of pretzels!

534
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,912
Then we're leaving just in time,
because these folks are gonna freak!

535
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,833
Deploy "BPS!

536
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,235
Stay on target!

537
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,917
We're gonna catch it!
We're gonna catch it!

538
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,637
Crikey! We're not gonna catch it!

539
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,791
Wait a minute. Where's Skipper?

540
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,837
Time to get creative.
Start grabbing boxes, boys!

541
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,999
Going long!

542
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,034
Private, stop playing
with those backpacks.

543
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,918
Find something useful!

544
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,195
Now we're talking! Let's get to work.

545
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,839
400 meters.

546
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:03,956
300 meters.

547
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,191
Speak American, Kowalski!

548
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,078
Sorry, sir. 218 yards.

549
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,435
109 yards.

550
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,149
Okay, then.

551
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,038
It's clear what we need to do next.

552
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,995
That feels right!

553
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,239
Impressive bouncing, boys.

554
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,630
Now, then, back to civilization.

555
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,473
If we're gonna take Dexter down...

556
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,393
we need to know
where he's gonna strike next.

557
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,879
Goal!

558
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:58,357
Elijah, would you please take them away?

559
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,038
Penguin footprints, still warm.

560
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,595
We just missed Dave.

561
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,080
Blast it! He's gone!

562
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,595
So many penguins!

563
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,075
Boss! He's stress-eating again!

564
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:20,798
Corporal!

565
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,756
There, there.

566
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,479
Rub the angry out of the tummy.

567
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,232
Corporal!

568
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,320
Focus!

569
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,790
We are going to save
those helpless penguins...

570
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,430
because we are the North Wind...

571
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,829
and no one...

572
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,356
no one breaks the Wind.

573
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,630
No one breaks the Wind.

574
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,229
There's a good Corporal.

575
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,074
Now, we rescued those four penguins
already, didn't we?

576
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,914
Shipped them off, all cozy and snug,
to a Madagascar safe--

577
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:48,876
How come there's beeping?

578
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,156
Sir, those penguins...

579
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,958
they never made it to Madagascar.

580
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,314
What? Well, where the dickens are they?

581
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,158
Kowalski, what are our coordinates?

582
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:06,314
From my calculations, we've arrived
in the center of Dublin, Ireland.

583
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,911
All right, soldiers, we got to blend in.
Riverdance!

584
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,070
But no time
to kiss the Blarney Stone, boys.

585
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,390
We need to find intel
on Dave's location.

586
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,516
Pronto!

587
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,396
All right, you! Where's Dave?
Give us the goods!

588
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,120
Spit it out!
Don't make me use me shillelagh!

589
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,794
Sir, that's a baby squid.

590
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,594
Sorry, laddie.

591
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:47,196
Stranded on the Emerald Isle
without a single clue.

592
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,431
Well, so much for the luck o' the Irish.

593
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,476
Skipper, look!

594
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,995
Begorrah!

595
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,389
Does anyone speak Gaelic?

596
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,910
No, but it looks like Dave's been busy.

597
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,390
He's stolen penguins from Guadalajara!

598
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,154
- Madrid!
- Paris!

599
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,430
Athens!

600
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,590
Bangalore!

601
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,310
Dusseldorf!

602
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,276
Osaka!

603
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,236
Rio de Janeiro!

604
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,959
- Nairobi!
Amsterdam!

605
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,474
Baton Rouge!

606
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,917
Dave's snow-globe collection!

607
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:19,311
It's every zoo and aquarium
he got kicked out of!

608
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,153
Don't tell me where he has been.

609
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,789
Tell me where
he will have has been next.

610
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,196
Wait, what is it, Rico?

611
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,553
It's a book! It's a film! It's a play!

612
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:28,757
First word.

613
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,797
Two syllables. Sounds like...

614
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,630
Sounds like...

615
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,676
Sounds like...

616
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,794
What starts with...?

617
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,679
Shanghai.

618
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,078
Dave hasn't been there yet, Skipper.

619
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,072
If we hurry, we can still stop him.

620
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,799
Nice work, Rico!

621
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,954
Pack your bagpipes, boys.
It's time to blow this potato stand!

622
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,795
So, this is it.

623
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:11,157
Shanghai's famous
Little Dublin district.

624
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,510
Skipper, look!

625
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,478
I see you, Private.

626
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,916
Who's the big boy
standing on his tippy-toes?

627
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,071
- No, I mean--
- I just wanna eat you up!

628
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,913
Skipper, look! Above Private!

629
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:24,630
Dave's next target.
Shanghai's famous Mermaid Penguins.

630
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,029
Good eye, Kowalski!

631
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,076
And once again...

632
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:30,756
you've proved that you are a meaningful
and valued member of this team.

633
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,554
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

634
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,360
<i>Shanghai Marine World
is pleased to present...</i>

635
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:41,036
<i>our world famous Mermaid Penguins!</i>

636
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,997
<i>Tonight, our mermaids
dedicate their performance...</i>

637
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:48,676
<i>to all of the missing penguins
around the world.</i>

638
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,354
<i>Stay safe, little guys,
wherever you are.</i>

639
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,591
<i>And we hope you come home real soon.</i>

640
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,553
Now, keep those eyes roving, boys.

641
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,030
Dave is a master of disguise.

642
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,476
He could be a small child,
a house plant.

643
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,358
Maybe even you, or me!

644
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,158
Is it you, Kowalski?

645
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,390
Hey, hold on.

646
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,116
Wait a minute.

647
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,670
Bingg!

648
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,671
Nice try, Dave.

649
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,434
Operation "Flash, Splash, and Crash"
is a go.

650
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,271
Splendid!

651
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,919
Take positions.

652
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:29,198
<i>Penguin feeding time
will begin in two minutes.</i>

653
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,358
Target, 30 yards and closing.

654
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,511
In position, Skipper.

655
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,109
<i>Rico, report.</i>

656
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,674
In position.

657
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,750
And for you, Private.

658
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:47,716
YES. Skipper!

659
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,791
- Here's your mermaid costume.
- What?

660
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,155
We need a diversion.

661
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,834
And, frankly, you're the only one
who can pull off that look.

662
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,913
But I can do more, Skipper.
I want to help the team.

663
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,559
Really help the team!

664
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,711
If you think I'm ready, which I am!

665
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,080
Assuming you agree, and perhaps even...

666
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,675
if you don't.

667
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,597
I like the moxie, soldier...

668
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:13,277
but right now, I need a tail on that tush
and the cutest smile you've got.

669
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,158
You trust me, soldier?

670
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,273
AVE-Bye, Skipper.

671
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,113
Hey, it's feeding time!

672
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,631
Target, 10 yards from flashpoint.

673
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,120
Private, you're up.

674
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,871
You just mermaid my day!

675
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,429
"Flash" is a go!

676
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,511
Look! They let one of the mermaids
out of the tank!

677
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,670
Oh, she's so cute!

678
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,989
It's the cutest thing I've ever seen!

679
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,114
Shields up!

680
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,956
Target is stunned.
Rico, bring the "Splash."

681
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,875
Yeah, yeah!

682
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,317
What are you doing out here, cutie?

683
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,959
Come on, back in your tank.

684
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,673
Secure the mermaids, and find me--

685
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,719
David, the octopus.

686
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,078
A little late, North Wind.

687
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,393
Mission accomplished.

688
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,550
High one!

689
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,279
Corporal, take our prisoner...

690
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:41,080
the one that belongs to us,
into custody.

691
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:41,957
What?

692
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,555
You melted him? You birds are sick!

693
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,957
He's going in through the pipes!

694
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:53,757
Skipper!

695
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,353
Private? Private!

696
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,478
You got to get out of there!

697
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,952
No, no, no! No, no, no!
Private!

698
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,030
Skipper!

699
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,432
Private!

700
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,509
'Help!
"No!

701
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,440
Here we go!

702
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,359
Move, move, move!

703
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,915
He's got Private!

704
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,753
He's getting away! He's getting away!

705
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,433
Skipper! The North Wind's plane!

706
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,238
Sweet chariot of the gods!

707
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,549
But can you fly it, man?

708
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,155
There's only way to find out.

709
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,109
No...

710
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,515
I still can't read.

711
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,639
Then we're going off book.

712
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,959
No! No, no, no!

713
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,949
Too much, too much, too much!

714
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,793
I'm getting the hang of this, Skipper.

715
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,876
Good! We're coming for you, Private!

716
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:04,470
Those ludicrous butterballs
are letting David escape!

717
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,710
Eva, secure transport.

718
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,791
Short Fuse, Corporal, hitch us a ride!

719
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,155
Fire!

720
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,953
Go, fetch!

721
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,480
Hold her steady!

722
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,870
Sir, Dave is pulling ahead.
We are too heavy.

723
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,675
Curse our heavily cheese-dibbled diet!

724
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,911
Rico, give me a West Helsinki fire sale!

725
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,515
- Yeah, yeah!
- Everything must go!

726
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,680
Huh? What the--?

727
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:03,597
That's everything, sir.

728
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,034
Have you purged the chemical toilet?

729
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,713
But Rico was in there for 15 minutes!

730
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:07,597
Just do it!

731
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,713
<i>Self-destruct sequence, in five...</i>

732
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:25,790
Private!

733
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,280
- Stay strong, soldier!
-...four...

734
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,033
<i>...three... two...</i>

735
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:30,831
<i>...one.</i>

736
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,470
Skipper's log.

737
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:53,556
Private has been kidnapped by Dave...

738
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:58,194
while we have been cast adrift
for what seems like days.

739
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:00,670
No rations, fresh water...

740
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,918
or land in sight.

741
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,953
Kowalski's sick as a dog...

742
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,674
and Rico...

743
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,070
keeps trying to eat him.

744
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,791
Just, please, just cut it out!

745
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,593
Not sure how long we can hold on.

746
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:23,000
This may be my final entry.

747
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:23,877
Ow!

748
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,670
<i>7.004, Grand Cm.
Hints oi pear , white peaches.</i>

749
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,074
This salmon is delicious.

750
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:32,915
I've never been
more hydrated in my life!

751
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,514
Let me cut you a piece of the salmon.

752
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:35,476
No, thank you.

753
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:36,994
It's the most delicious thing
on the boat.

754
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,514
I have to loosen my utility belt.

755
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:41,149
No, I'm full. Just dump it in the ocean.

756
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:45,718
You know,
we're all in the same boat, here.

757
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,269
Actually, we're not.

758
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,875
And perhaps you could express
a little more concern...

759
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,713
over the fact that you stole
and destroyed...

760
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:54,440
a $19 million vehicle!

761
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,594
Bill me!

762
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,031
Corporal?

763
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:58,917
Corporal!

764
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:01,310
We're picking up a signal, sir.

765
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,395
It's five klicks southwest...

766
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,995
but it stopped at that remote island.

767
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,116
Land?

768
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:12,270
Good on you!
You've tracked down some land.

769
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,874
No, silly willy.

770
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:17,032
We've been tracking
your little secretary/mascot.

771
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,111
What? You put a homing device
on Private?

772
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,759
All of you, actually...

773
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,354
when I "darted" you.

774
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,719
You low-down...

775
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,952
dirty, mangy, filthy...

776
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:31,636
flea-bitten, bum-sniffing
toilet-drinker!

777
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:34,435
But...

778
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:35,636
Good!

779
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:38,156
See? I told you.

780
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,880
You should've left this
to the professionals.

781
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:19,476
892... 893...

782
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:21,153
894...

783
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,399
Ahoy, there!

784
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,757
Penguins!

785
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,669
I bet you're all just dying to know
why I brought you here.

786
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:36,672
He's gonna kill us all!

787
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:39,116
What? No.

788
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:43,113
My Medusa Serum doesn't kill anyone.

789
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,714
Where's the fun in that?

790
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,837
So, what does it do?

791
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:50,438
Something much, much worse.

792
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:55,271
Right! But, like, what specifically?

793
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:59,630
Well, that's exactly
what I came up here to show you.

794
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,632
All I need is a test subject.

795
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,038
Hello, little buggy-boo!

796
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:05,793
Is this about the chirping?
Because I could--

797
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:14,354
Behold, as I unleash the full power
of the Medusa Serum!

798
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:16,551
Fire!

799
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,953
Yes! It works!

800
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:31,113
I made a monster! I made a monster!

801
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:34,473
And all you adorable penguins are next!

802
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,278
Crikey!

803
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,075
Who said that?

804
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:40,951
No.

805
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,320
No.

806
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:44,311
No.

807
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:49,236
Yes!

808
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:52,440
Gentlemen, you remember Private.

809
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:53,829
Hey, Private.

810
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,630
You'll never get away with this, Dave.

811
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:57,995
My brothers are coming.

812
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:01,835
And, together, we'll take a wrecking ball
to your whole rotten operation.

813
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,310
Call off the hunt, everyone.

814
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:09,236
Turns out the elite unit
will be coming to us.

815
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:19,795
<i>Eva.</i>

816
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:22,318
<i>What do you see?</i>

817
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,830
My count is 30 hostiles.

818
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:27,274
31.

819
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:31,560
Those two are very close... together.

820
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:34,280
I mean, "intertwined."

821
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:35,475
Physically.

822
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,519
But not in a...

823
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,478
lx-nay on the irt-flay, Kowalski.

824
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,555
Poor Private.

825
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:45,669
Alone! Helpless in the belly
of that beast.

826
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:48,116
We've faced some long odds
before, Skipper.

827
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:51,955
But these look like the longest.
And oddest.

828
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:55,795
If we're going to pull this off,
we'll need a diversion.

829
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,032
<i>Deactivating jungle camouflage.</i>

830
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,235
Will you be quiet?

831
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,390
Listen, Classified...

832
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,995
Short Fuse, you were supposed
to handcuff them to the raft!

833
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:04,276
Don't you hologram me!

834
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:07,080
I tried, but they don't have hands.
They just have flippers, boss.

835
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:10,279
And I have flippers,
so it's flipping useless!

836
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:13,479
All right, pooch.
If you won't work with us...

837
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,399
you better work for us.

838
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:17,312
Our plan requires a diversion.

839
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:18,550
I give the orders around here.

840
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,838
As much as it pains me,
I need you to act as our diversion...

841
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,673
for our operation. Understood?

842
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:27,117
No! This is our plan, and it
requires you to cause a diversion.

843
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,190
-"Dye"-version.
-"Di"-version.

844
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:29,031
-"Dye.
-"Di."

845
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,874
“Dye! Dye! Dye!"
-"Di! Di! Di!"

846
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:35,396
Gentlemen, there is only one way
to resolve this.

847
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:37,039
- We should kiss.
- Plan-off.

848
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:41,393
Yup, "plan-off."
That's what I was gonna say.

849
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:42,755
"Plan-off."

850
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,473
Here's Dave's sub.

851
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,798
And this young, helpless,
vulnerable rock...

852
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,473
is Private.

853
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:53,869
And here's Dave.

854
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:58,311
While you four blowhards
divert the octopi...

855
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,710
we strike fast, and strike hard!

856
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,149
Get on in here, boys!

857
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:04,640
Slap him silly, Rico! Come on!

858
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,998
Kowalski, free the hostages!

859
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,515
Now, that's what I'm talking about,
big fella!

860
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:15,231
With Private freshly liberated,
we celebrate with a well-earned high one...

861
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,630
and feast off Dave's sweet remains.

862
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:18,756
Any questions?

863
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:22,879
Whoa! Hey, now!

864
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,600
Wow. I mean, truly impressive.

865
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:29,469
Especially the bit
where you slap the fruit.

866
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:33,078
Corporal, dim the lights.
Short Fuse, glasses.

867
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,193
My apologies. I had to rush a bit.

868
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:43,920
The schematic is a little crude.

869
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:45,514
Where is that music coming from?

870
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:49,550
All right.
At 21:50, Skipper, Kowalski and...

871
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:50,869
Richard, was it?

872
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:54,317
...divert the octopi
away from their posts.

873
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,989
At 22:00,
Short Fuse breaches the hull...

874
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:00,278
with a swarm of self-guided,
underwater nano-charges.

875
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,475
I call them "wet kabooms.

876
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,039
- Please, don't.
- Okay, sorry.

877
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,953
- At 22:02, knock-knock.
- Who's there?

878
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,236
- The North Wind.
-"The North Wind" who?

879
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,152
The North Wind who doesn't have time
for knock-knock jokes...

880
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:14,278
because we're too busy taking down Dave!

881
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,232
Personal hover tank? Check.

882
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,550
Auto-targeting wing mounts? Why not?

883
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,040
At 22:09...

884
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,431
.mission accomplished.

885
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,113
See that? I don't even look back.

886
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:29,594
There's a huge explosion,
and I just keep walking.

887
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:33,594
Way to go, boss!
That's North Wind, sucker!

888
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:34,750
Nicely done.

889
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,954
Blah-di-blah-blah-blah.

890
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:45,511
A good plan is about more than
effect-y stuff...

891
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:46,715
and vocabulary words.

892
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:50,557
And you certainly know a good plan.

893
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:54,395
Your operation in Shanghai
allowed Dave to escape...

894
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:55,880
with your boy.

895
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:01,353
I've never lost a member of my team.
It must feel...

896
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:02,636
awful!

897
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,710
God, imagine the guilt. The regret.

898
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:09,116
The feeling that, I don't know...

899
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:11,832
that it should have been you.

900
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:20,718
All for penguin plan.

901
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:25,150
All for North Wind plan.

902
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,356
His...

903
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:33,754
His is better.

904
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:34,917
What?

905
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:40,991
I'm sorry, boys.
But I can't lead you this time.

906
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:42,116
But...

907
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,159
we're a team.

908
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:47,197
And you're our skipper, Skipper.

909
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:49,476
We don't need these guys.

910
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:52,712
No, Kowalski, but Private does.

911
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,239
I think...

912
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,630
this time,
we leave it to the professionals.

913
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:59,393
- But, sir...
- It's settled.

914
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:01,995
We take our orders
from Agent Classified now.

915
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:04,953
That's an order, Rico!

916
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,551
All right, Classified...

917
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:17,350
what's the diversion?

918
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:28,435
We take this shame to our graves.

919
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:29,431
Agreed.

920
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:53,958
Hey!

921
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,558
- Time?
-22:00 hours.

922
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:07,472
Time to take down Dave.

923
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:31,673
David, the octopus...

924
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:33,918
show me your tentacles.

925
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,030
All of them.

926
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,035
We lost them, Skipper.

927
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:02,751
Not a moment too soon.
These <i>hosen</i> are ridin' up my bundesliga.

928
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:06,276
All right, boys, grab your coconuts
and hold them tight.

929
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:10,115
Classified should be walking away
from a huge explosion...

930
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:13,910
with Private on his shoulder
in three, two...

931
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:15,559
Give him a welcome home, Rico!

932
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:20,278
Yes! In your face, Dave!

933
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,074
The Private is back!

934
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:22,911
Welcome home, Private!

935
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:24,354
Yeah, all right!

936
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:26,591
Here we go. All right.

937
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,831
Sir, the sub didn't explode...

938
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,038
and I fear the fireworks...

939
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:35,192
may have been a tactical mistake.

940
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:44,470
Stay calm!

941
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,278
Do not panic!

942
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:47,794
We will still win!

943
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:49,792
Be full of love! Don't hate!

944
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:50,916
Follow your dreams.

945
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:52,991
Love yourself. Love other people.

946
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:54,912
Pick and choose your battles in life!

947
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:56,832
Don't let anyone tell you what to do.

948
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,195
Ignore the haters.

949
00:54:58,440 --> 00:54:59,874
Love the one you're with.

950
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:01,151
Eva !

951
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,752
I know!

952
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:15,029
Welcome, Skipper, Kowalski,
and rootin'-tootin' Rico!

953
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:17,476
The gang's all here!
The mood is electric!

954
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:20,519
Is this really, finally everybody?

955
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,591
All right, Dave,
just what have you done with...

956
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:23,511
Private!

957
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:24,955
Guys!

958
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:26,754
You're in for it now, Dave!

959
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:28,035
Really?

960
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,634
Anyway, great catching up.

961
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:33,475
Now, who's ready to move on
to live penguin testing?

962
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:36,359
You point that death ray
away from Private, right now!

963
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:37,954
It's not a death ray, Skipper.

964
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:40,191
He's gonna turn us into monsters!

965
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:41,509
Yepper-doo!

966
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,717
And what comes next, Dave?

967
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:44,995
Invasion!

968
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:49,916
Horrible mutant penguins,
unleashed on the streets of New York City!

969
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,718
You're the monster!

970
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:52,517
Yes!

971
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:53,795
I'm the monster.

972
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:58,955
Everyone made that clear to me
every day of my entire life.

973
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:03,355
But let's see how much everyone loves you
when you're the monster!

974
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:04,078
Skipper!

975
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:05,639
You can't take away Private's cuteness!

976
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:08,155
He's the cute one. That's his thing!

977
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:08,991
What?

978
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:10,594
It's all the little guy's got!

979
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:13,154
You are super cute.

980
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:14,879
We better crank this up.

981
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,156
Drew, Barry, more power.

982
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:19,391
- Ready?
- Negotiations have broken down!

983
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:21,437
Rico, the paperclip!
Bust us out of here!

984
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,515
We need that paperclip!

985
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:24,670
Chop-chop, soldier!

986
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,554
Where's the paperclip?

987
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:33,317
Private!

988
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:41,317
No!

989
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:48,193
- Private.
- Oh, no.

990
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:53,199
I disintegrated him.

991
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:55,397
That wasn't supposed to happen.

992
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:57,312
You maniac!

993
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:58,800
You blew him up!

994
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:00,476
No.

995
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:01,791
Oh, well!

996
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,997
This is why we test things, people!

997
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:07,273
I'll have to lower the power
for the others.

998
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:10,074
Full speed ahead, gentlemen.

999
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:13,631
The monsters are due in Manhattan.

1000
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:40,350
Sorry!

1001
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:53,156
Crikey!

1002
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:56,398
All right, all right, octopus.

1003
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:59,234
Whatever Dave's paying you,
I'll double it.

1004
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:02,631
Is that a yes?
Does anyone speak octopus?

1005
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:04,074
- Sorry.
- Not a clue.

1006
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:04,877
Blast it!

1007
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:09,151
You free us...

1008
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:10,958
we give you...

1009
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,793
many fishes!

1010
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,150
What is that?

1011
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:25,596
Oh, great.

1012
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:26,716
Oh, no! This is it!

1013
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:29,315
I don't want to die all squishy!

1014
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:33,675
We're dead. Dead!

1015
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,673
Dead. Dead!

1016
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:37,990
Oh, no, we're dead!

1017
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:39,430
Dead!

1018
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,799
Dead!

1019
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:46,310
I pushed a button!

1020
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:48,877
Super. Well done, Private!

1021
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:50,439
<i>Good work, malinki.</i>

1022
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:52,716
Yes. Yes.

1023
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:55,191
Excellent button-pushing.

1024
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:56,395
Compliment, praise, etcetera.

1025
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:58,155
All right, agents...

1026
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:00,038
we are back In business.

1027
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,352
Wait! Skipper, Kowalski, Rico...

1028
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:06,430
all those penguins...

1029
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:07,749
They're this way!

1030
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,354
So is a massive army of octopi

1031
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:11,352
And as soon as we return
to the North Wind Headquarters...

1032
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:12,635
grab fresh equipment...

1033
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:14,154
and work up a smashing new plan...

1034
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:17,199
we'll come speeding back,
and take down Dave.

1035
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:20,352
But the penguins are in danger!
We have to go now!

1036
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:22,796
Again, "Huge army of octopi."

1037
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:25,520
So, because you failed once,
you're just running away?

1038
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:28,957
We did not fail.
And we are not running away.

1039
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:30,952
We're just very sensibly regrouping.

1040
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:32,235
Skipper wouldn't care!

1041
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:35,233
Plan or no, fancy equipment or no...

1042
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:37,677
he'd never leave a man behind!

1043
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:41,278
Well, I suppose we can't all be penguins,
can we?

1044
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:48,076
No.

1045
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:51,549
But maybe you should be.

1046
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,154
Come on.

1047
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:12,236
Showtime, everyone!
Big smiles for the Big Apple!

1048
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:13,959
Listen up, Doris!

1049
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:16,839
You turn us into freaks, and then what?

1050
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,913
You think that's gonna
make everybody love you?

1051
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:22,710
No, but they'll despise you.

1052
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:29,830
And I'm sure going to love that!

1053
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:41,157
Breaking news!
The missing penguins have been found!

1054
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:42,594
Okay. According to my notes...

1055
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:45,434
genetic researcher, Dr. Octavius Brine
has found the penguins...

1056
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,511
and is bringing them here
to New York's Battery Park.

1057
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:49,353
The penguins are coming back!

1058
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:50,749
Oh, my gosh! Look!

1059
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:19,271
<i>Penguin lovers of the world!</i>

1060
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,034
<i>Guess who I found.</i>

1061
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:22,952
Penguins! Penguins!

1062
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:24,519
<i>It wasn't easy...</i>

1063
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:27,513
<i>but seeing the penguins
get what they deserve...</i>

1064
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:29,751
<i>will make it all worthwhile.</i>

1065
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:32,389
What a weird thing to say.
I'm so excited!

1066
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:34,431
Do it.

1067
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:48,477
Skipper! Skipper! Skipper!

1068
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:49,789
Rico! Kowalski!

1069
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:53,591
It's like I can still hear
his little voice calling to us!

1070
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:56,400
You have to get out of there! Move!

1071
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:59,678
"You have a great otter, there. Moo."

1072
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:00,955
Why would he moo?

1073
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:04,670
What are you asking me for?
I'm not Private's little ghost.

1074
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:08,076
Uh-oh.

1075
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:11,755
No!

1076
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:16,797
Are you ready?

1077
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:17,836
Yeah!

1078
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:22,398
<i>Yaw.!</i>

1079
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:28,072
Your new...

1080
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:29,914
and improved...

1081
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:32,233
Penguins!

1082
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:36,233
Penguins! Penguins!

1083
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:39,358
Penguins! Penguins! Penguins!

1084
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:55,313
The people love you.
Just go give them a hug!

1085
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:05,910
Don't let them touch you!

1086
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:16,671
Oh, no. What's happening?

1087
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,439
Nobody likes you anymore?

1088
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:20,756
Well, the fun and games
are just beginning.

1089
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:22,194
Watch this, penguins!

1090
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:23,430
Somebody call...

1091
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:25,034
the exterminators!

1092
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:36,075
And when the exterminators
take you away...

1093
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:38,629
you never come back!

1094
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:03,270
Oh, dear.

1095
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:05,313
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!

1096
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:06,914
What do I do? What do I do?

1097
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:08,877
Crikey!

1098
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:17,198
Come on, then, you wanna go?
You want some argy-bargy?

1099
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:43,194
Uh-oh, missed one!

1100
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:46,797
What a wonderful day in the park!

1101
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:47,911
Skipper!

1102
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:54,469
Wait!

1103
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:58,077
Hold on! What are you doing?

1104
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:01,871
Skipper!

1105
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:04,471
Don't eat that!

1106
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:09,351
Skipper, listen! It's me, Private.

1107
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:11,670
I've got a plan, but I need your help.

1108
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:13,797
I need my Skipper.

1109
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:35,875
Private?

1110
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:37,439
Yes! That's it!

1111
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,477
Private, you're alive!

1112
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:42,753
Oh, God!

1113
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:57,552
Kowalski! You've got to get a grip!

1114
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:01,589
Kowalski! Eva is worried about you!

1115
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:03,030
She is?

1116
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:04,156
What did she say?

1117
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:05,799
Did she say my name, specifically?

1118
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:09,396
I mean, were there tears?
Details! Come on, tell me!

1119
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:12,359
Private! You're alive! Come here.

1120
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:14,158
This feels a little awkward...

1121
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:15,310
but I'm happy-

1122
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:21,152
Rico! You need to listen to us.

1123
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:24,474
I guess you're kind of the same
either way.

1124
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:27,356
Heads up!

1125
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:32,560
Looks like we're back in business, boys.

1126
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:35,519
And our business is saving penguin-kind.

1127
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:37,189
Who's with me?

1128
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:38,395
Count me in.

1129
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:39,516
Let's do this!

1130
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:42,311
Let's create and feel momentum!

1131
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:49,435
Sir, how long do we stand here
like this?

1132
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:52,877
Until we've reached maximum coolness.

1133
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:56,680
There it is.

1134
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:58,234
Now all we need is a plan.

1135
01:06:58,400 --> 01:06:59,470
I've got one!

1136
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:05,311
You stole Dave's ray?

1137
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:08,757
Well, I figured if we could
reverse the ray...

1138
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:11,036
we could turn everyone back to normal.

1139
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:12,430
Reverse the ray?

1140
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:13,670
That's brilliant!

1141
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:15,638
But it's impossible.

1142
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:18,553
In order to reverse the ray, we would need
to replace the Medusa Serum...

1143
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:21,917
with a power source
of almost immeasurable cuteness.

1144
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:23,798
"Immeasurable cuteness

1145
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:25,871
Where the heck
are we supposed to get that?

1146
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:38,079
No, wait, Private! No!

1147
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:39,833
We don't know what that will do to you!

1148
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:43,556
All right!

1149
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:45,393
The ray! It works!

1150
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:46,356
It works!

1151
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:48,033
Private! Are you okay?

1152
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:49,236
Yes!

1153
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:51,474
Whoa! Butt-hand!

1154
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:54,029
There's a hand attached to his butt.

1155
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:55,190
That was not there before.

1156
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:57,078
Get out of there! That's an order!

1157
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:58,196
Permission to defy order.

1158
01:07:58,360 --> 01:07:59,191
Permission denied!

1159
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:00,589
Then I deny your denial.

1160
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:01,795
It's too risky, Private!

1161
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:03,871
It already made you sprout a butt-hand!

1162
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:06,190
I know it has to be me this time.

1163
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:10,273
And I think you know it, too.

1164
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:25,470
I'm the secret weapon!

1165
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:38,675
I'm happy! And Vet--

1166
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:43,630
now that I have my revenge,
I feel empty.

1167
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:47,953
As if what I needed all along was...

1168
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:49,549
more revenge!

1169
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:51,472
In fact, Robin, write this down.

1170
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:53,756
Tomorrow, we move on to kittens!

1171
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:56,275
Then, puppies! Bunnies! Pandas!

1172
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:00,274
Charlize, they're on the ray!

1173
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:03,479
<i>Helen, hunt them down!</i>

1174
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:04,960
<i>William, hurt them.</i>

1175
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:06,349
<i>Halle, bury them!</i>

1176
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:08,716
<i>Hugh, Jack, man the battle stations!</i>

1177
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:10,234
<i>Kevin, bake on!</i>

1178
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:12,835
<i>We're still gonna need
that victory cake!</i>

1179
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:22,670
We're only gonna get
one shot at this, boys.

1180
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:24,558
How we doing on those snow globes?

1181
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:26,837
Beam-splitter ready!

1182
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,229
Fire at will!

1183
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:30,475
Do it, Skipper!

1184
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:43,635
Dead batteries?

1185
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:45,560
Game over, Skipper.

1186
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:48,151
No!

1187
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:51,119
Rico, batteries!

1188
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:53,749
Skipper, Kowalski,
hold off those octopi!

1189
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:55,752
We're doing this now!

1190
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:59,110
You heard Private! Deploy!

1191
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:19,120
Get back, you aquatic savages!

1192
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:21,874
Behind you! Beside you!
Six o'clock! Twelve o'clock!

1193
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:27,469
They're coming from every direction!

1194
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:29,711
There's just too many of them!

1195
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:50,351
Whoa!

1196
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:51,476
You came back!

1197
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:03,317
Oh! That's why you look back
at the explosion.

1198
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:18,675
Fallback positions!

1199
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:21,395
Stay away from Private!

1200
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:28,030
Suck it up, Kowalski!

1201
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:31,396
No!

1202
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:33,392
It's over, Skipper.

1203
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:35,233
Over? That's weird.

1204
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:38,518
Then why is Rico
throwing me a fresh pair of double-As?

1205
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:43,956
No!

1206
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:45,191
The remote!

1207
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:54,150
Rico! Dibble me!

1208
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:50,870
It worked!

1209
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:52,070
Private!

1210
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:54,672
Excuse me! Emergency! Coming through.

1211
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:56,677
Make a hole! Make a hole!

1212
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:01,471
Oh, no!

1213
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:03,233
Don't worry!

1214
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:07,280
A chrysalis is just forming around you.
That's perfectly normal.

1215
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:20,079
Private.

1216
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:30,156
Private?

1217
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:36,431
Oh, look at that. Majestic!

1218
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:37,829
Hello!

1219
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:40,634
- Oh! Hey!
- What's wrong?

1220
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:42,710
Have I got something...?

1221
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,439
Cover your eyes. Don't turn your head!

1222
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:47,309
So...

1223
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:49,030
How do I look?

1224
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:51,714
You're hideously disfigured...

1225
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:54,349
and will probably be hunted for sport.

1226
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:55,191
What?

1227
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:56,596
What?

1228
01:13:57,200 --> 01:14:02,149
If there's anything we've learned
from this delightful adventure, Kowalski...

1229
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:04,470
it's that looks don't matter.

1230
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:07,390
It's what you do that counts.

1231
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:10,990
And look at what you did.

1232
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:32,398
Yes, sir.

1233
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:37,236
You are the most meaningful
and valued member of this team.

1234
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:55,634
Way to go, Private!

1235
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:57,714
Atta boy!

1236
01:14:58,080 --> 01:14:59,354
Nicely done.

1237
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:02,755
Way to go, Private. You did it!

1238
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:04,672
We're so proud of you!

1239
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,274
You saved us!

1240
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:08,397
We love you, Private!

1241
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:10,312
Yeah, we love you!

1242
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:12,073
You the penguin!

1243
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:31,676
Ramirez!

1244
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:33,353
-"Dave."
- Dave!

1245
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:41,873
What? Are you kidding me?

1246
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:45,273
Dave! Oh, look at you.

1247
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:48,876
You think this is over?
I'm just getting started!

1248
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:51,072
What do we do with him now?

1249
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:53,399
Open this right now!

1250
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:54,914
Here you go, kid.

1251
01:15:57,400 --> 01:15:58,993
Cool!

1252
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:06,751
I hope you find happiness, Dave.

1253
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:10,117
It's snowing!
It's snowing! It's snowing!

1254
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:13,073
It's snowing! It's snowing!
It's snowing! It's snowing!

1255
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:15,230
Right. Now, then...

1256
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:18,073
This is difficult for me to say--

1257
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:19,878
Is it "osteoporosis"?

1258
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:21,235
You just got to lean into the vowel.

1259
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:22,629
Os-tee-oh-...

1260
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:24,958
No, no.

1261
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:29,193
I want to say, you four are
the bravest agents I have ever known.

1262
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:31,591
The point is...

1263
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:33,393
I was wrong about you.

1264
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:37,269
And I hope there is some way
I can make it right.

1265
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:38,874
- Give us jetpacks?
- We should kiss.

1266
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:42,797
Did you just say...?

1267
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:49,159
Well, that feels right!

1268
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:51,351
I think I'd actually
prefer a jetpack, please.

1269
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:55,199
I think we should go with
Private's idea.

1270
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:01,677
Kowalski, what's our trajectory?

1271
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:06,516
95% certain this will end in massive,
flaming disaster.

1272
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:07,909
And the other 5%?

1273
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:11,072
Irrelevant, sir. Jetpacks are awesome!

1274
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:12,230
Agreed.

1275
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,957
Who says penguins can't fly?

1276
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:30,310
Booyah!

1277
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:08,356
<i>Skipper, we are going to turn me
back to normal, right?</i>

1278
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:09,874
<i>Absolutely. First thing, Monday.</i>

1279
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:15,678
I'm in a rocket ship!

1280
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:17,319
I want to push the button.

1281
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:18,436
Give me that.

1282
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:19,790
Stealer!

1283
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:21,399
Let's do this! I'm ready!

1284
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:22,994
Okay, on three. One, three, go!

1285
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:25,956
I'm just going to do
a little practice push.

1286
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:27,834
Okay, I'm not going to press it--

1287
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,594
Why are you smacking my hand?
Hey, look over there!

1288
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:32,673
I'm a laser show!

1289
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:35,116
Julien!

1290
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:37,316
Hey!

1291
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:39,989
That's the Private we know and love.
High one!

1292
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:42,518
Immeasurable cuteness, right there.

1293
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:43,909
Good to be back.

1294
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:46,954
I feel like a french fry.

1295
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:49,398
I'm okay!

1296
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:51,039
And with cuteness to spare.

1297
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:54,431
Come on!
Frosty mugs of herring juice, all around.

1298
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:55,556
- Private's buying.
- What?

1299
01:18:55,720 --> 01:18:58,792
You know, if I'm being honest,
I expected a little more...

1300
01:18:59,000 --> 01:18:59,751
Dizzazz!

1301
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:03,791
Yes! Now, that's pizzazz!
