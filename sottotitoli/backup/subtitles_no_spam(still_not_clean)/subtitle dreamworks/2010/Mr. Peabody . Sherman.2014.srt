1
00:01:01,591 --> 00:01:03,759
 Our story begins
high over New York City...

2
00:01:03,927 --> 00:01:05,511
in the luxurious
penthouse apartment...

3
00:01:05,679 --> 00:01:09,056
of perhaps
the most unlikely genius
the world has ever known.

4
00:01:10,684 --> 00:01:12,852
Oh. Sorry. You caught me
doing my yoga.

5
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:14,019
You were expecting

6
00:01:14,104 --> 00:01:15,855
downward dog,
perhaps? 

7
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,525
My name is Mr. Peabody.

8
00:01:19,693 --> 00:01:21,694
And since we're going to be
spending some time together...

9
00:01:21,862 --> 00:01:23,904
I'd like to tell you
a little bit about myself.

10
00:01:24,072 --> 00:01:25,239
You see,
ever since I was a pup...

11
00:01:25,407 --> 00:01:27,241
it was clear that
I was different.

12
00:01:29,286 --> 00:01:30,744
I tried
to fit in...

13
00:01:30,829 --> 00:01:31,871
No, thank you.

14
00:01:31,955 --> 00:01:33,581
...but never could.

15
00:01:34,124 --> 00:01:36,375
As I grew,
I saw more and more
of my littermates...

16
00:01:36,751 --> 00:01:39,420
being chosen by
their new families.

17
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:43,048
But for some reason,
I never was.

18
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,052
Come on, boy!
Fetch the stick!

19
00:01:47,554 --> 00:01:49,597
But why? Won't you
just throw it again?

20
00:01:49,764 --> 00:01:52,057
It's an exercise in futility.

21
00:01:52,225 --> 00:01:54,727
I don't want this one,
Mommy. He's sarcastic.

22
00:01:54,895 --> 00:01:56,896
Wait, wait!
Come back!
Throw the stick.

23
00:01:57,063 --> 00:01:59,773
I'll stay, I'll heel,
I'll even shake hands.

24
00:01:59,941 --> 00:02:01,484
Bark, bark?

25
00:02:01,651 --> 00:02:04,820
So, without
a family of my own...

26
00:02:04,988 --> 00:02:07,448
I dedicated myself to
the pursuit of knowledge...

27
00:02:07,741 --> 00:02:10,075
culture, and athletics.

28
00:02:11,912 --> 00:02:13,787
I received my
degree at Harvard.

29
00:02:13,955 --> 00:02:15,789
Vale-dog-torian, of course.

30
00:02:15,874 --> 00:02:16,916
 Yay!

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,919
And then,
I devoted myself
to helping mankind.

32
00:02:20,086 --> 00:02:22,755
I pioneered new techniques
in alternative energy.

33
00:02:24,925 --> 00:02:26,091
 Yay!

34
00:02:26,301 --> 00:02:28,761
Resolved
geopolitical conflicts
around the globe.

35
00:02:32,098 --> 00:02:33,182
And in my spare time...

36
00:02:33,266 --> 00:02:35,851
I invented
the fist bump, planking,
tearaway pants...

37
00:02:35,936 --> 00:02:37,019
Auto-Tune...

38
00:02:37,103 --> 00:02:38,312
the backside ollie...

39
00:02:38,396 --> 00:02:39,480
and Zumba.

40
00:02:39,564 --> 00:02:41,106
Now go

41
00:02:41,525 --> 00:02:42,691
Stop

42
00:02:43,193 --> 00:02:44,235
Drop

43
00:02:45,111 --> 00:02:46,237
Pause

44
00:02:46,863 --> 00:02:50,533
But what I'm most proud of
is my son, Sherman.

45
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,785
Hi, Mr. Peabody.

46
00:02:52,869 --> 00:02:56,330
Oh! Have you
told them about the WABAC?

47
00:02:56,706 --> 00:02:58,791
 I was
just getting to that.

48
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,294
When I adopted Sherman,
I vowed to be
the best father I could be.

49
00:03:02,462 --> 00:03:04,755
To prepare him for all
the wonders of the world,

50
00:03:04,839 --> 00:03:06,465
present and past.

51
00:03:06,633 --> 00:03:10,970
And so, Sherman
inspired the greatest
invention of my life...

52
00:03:11,555 --> 00:03:13,973
a time machine.

53
00:03:20,146 --> 00:03:23,899
Of course, time travel
can be a bit unpredictable.

54
00:03:24,067 --> 00:03:26,735
There are bound to be
a few mishaps along the way.

55
00:03:26,903 --> 00:03:28,320
Let's just say,
the Leaning Tower of Pisa

56
00:03:28,405 --> 00:03:30,239
wasn't always leaning.

57
00:03:30,407 --> 00:03:31,532
 But there's
nothing like learning

58
00:03:31,658 --> 00:03:32,783
the lessons of
history firsthand.

59
00:03:32,867 --> 00:03:33,909
Right, Sherman?

60
00:03:33,994 --> 00:03:35,869
Where are we going
today, Mr. Peabody?

61
00:03:36,037 --> 00:03:37,496
Not "where," Sherman.

62
00:03:37,664 --> 00:03:39,498
"When."

63
00:03:52,429 --> 00:03:55,431
 Whoa! This is
the biggest house
I've ever seen!

64
00:03:55,682 --> 00:03:58,559
 It's the Palace
of Versailles, home
of Marie Antoinette.

65
00:03:58,727 --> 00:04:01,186
You know,
she was mostly
famous for one thing.

66
00:04:01,354 --> 00:04:02,563
Cake!

67
00:04:02,731 --> 00:04:06,025
I love cake so much.

68
00:04:10,113 --> 00:04:12,906
Marie Antoinette
sure likes cake,
Mr. Peabody.

69
00:04:13,074 --> 00:04:14,199
 Oh!
Indeed she does.

70
00:04:14,367 --> 00:04:16,201
Marie was a woman
with a prodigious
appetite...

71
00:04:16,369 --> 00:04:18,370
for all things
covered with frosting.

72
00:04:18,538 --> 00:04:21,707
But her expensive tastes
made her the target
of much criticism.

73
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:23,542
Why?
Because, Sherman...

74
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,210
during Marie's reign,
the common people

75
00:04:25,378 --> 00:04:26,879
of France were
exceedingly poor.

76
00:04:27,881 --> 00:04:28,881
You've got any bread?

77
00:04:29,049 --> 00:04:31,884
No! I'm exceedingly poor.

78
00:04:32,469 --> 00:04:33,886
Now, can we
have some cake?

79
00:04:34,054 --> 00:04:35,054
Mais, oui.

80
00:04:35,221 --> 00:04:37,723
Oh, yeah, sorry.

81
00:04:37,891 --> 00:04:39,391
"May we" have some cake?

82
00:04:39,559 --> 00:04:40,726
Mais, oui!

83
00:04:41,227 --> 00:04:42,728
Maybe she can't hear me
through the hair.

84
00:04:42,896 --> 00:04:45,105
Sherman, what
the queen means is...

85
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:48,192
Ah! 
Let them eat cake!

86
00:04:51,237 --> 00:04:54,406
When the queen
heard the poor of Paris
could not even buy bread...

87
00:04:54,574 --> 00:04:56,909
she said,
"Let them eat cake."

88
00:04:56,993 --> 00:04:57,868
No!

89
00:04:57,952 --> 00:04:59,161
I heard it myself.

90
00:04:59,287 --> 00:05:00,537
It's a scandal!
It's an outrage!

91
00:05:00,622 --> 00:05:01,747
Down with the queen!

92
00:05:01,831 --> 00:05:02,831
Down with the monarchy!

93
00:05:03,249 --> 00:05:04,291
Wait!

94
00:05:04,459 --> 00:05:06,085
What kind of cake?

95
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,803
Smashing party,
Your Majesty.

96
00:05:16,179 --> 00:05:18,681
But now, I'm afraid
Sherman and I must be...

97
00:05:18,848 --> 00:05:21,100
Sherman? Sherman?

98
00:05:21,267 --> 00:05:22,976
Sherman!

99
00:05:24,938 --> 00:05:26,605
Sherman?

100
00:05:28,817 --> 00:05:31,443
Sherman! Here,
Sherman. 

101
00:05:31,986 --> 00:05:33,278
Hey, Mr. Peabody.

102
00:05:33,446 --> 00:05:35,155
What are you doing in here?

103
00:05:35,323 --> 00:05:36,532
Trying these other cakes.

104
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:41,036
There's one in here
with whipped cream and
strawberries that's...

105
00:05:41,538 --> 00:05:42,705
pretty fantastic!

106
00:05:42,831 --> 00:05:43,956
Sherman...

107
00:05:44,124 --> 00:05:45,958
don't you remember
why I told you to stay

108
00:05:46,126 --> 00:05:47,960
close to me during
the French Revolution?

109
00:05:48,128 --> 00:05:49,837
Because after
the French Revolution...

110
00:05:50,004 --> 00:05:51,630
it was gonna rain?
Close.

111
00:05:51,798 --> 00:05:54,133
I said, "After the
French Revolution comes...

112
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,427
the Reign of Terror!"

113
00:06:01,975 --> 00:06:04,810
Round up the aristocrats.

114
00:06:19,325 --> 00:06:22,244
The queen and her
aristocratic cronies...

115
00:06:22,412 --> 00:06:25,164
must pay the price
for their gluttony.

116
00:06:25,331 --> 00:06:28,250
We will slaughter them
like the dogs they are.

117
00:06:28,418 --> 00:06:30,335
Starting with this one!

118
00:06:30,837 --> 00:06:31,837
 Mr. Peabody!

119
00:06:32,672 --> 00:06:34,006
What should I do?

120
00:06:34,174 --> 00:06:37,009
Nothing, Sherman.
Just stay right there.

121
00:06:37,177 --> 00:06:38,343
But, Mr. Peabody!

122
00:06:38,511 --> 00:06:40,345
Everything is going
to be fine, Sherman.

123
00:06:40,513 --> 00:06:43,182
Just stay right there.

124
00:06:49,564 --> 00:06:51,398
Off with his head!

125
00:06:53,943 --> 00:06:56,487
Mr. Peabody!

126
00:07:02,035 --> 00:07:03,535
A cantaloupe?

127
00:07:03,703 --> 00:07:05,454
The lowest of the fruits.

128
00:07:05,622 --> 00:07:09,041
Who dares to insult me
with this melon?

129
00:07:12,921 --> 00:07:15,589
Get that dog!

130
00:07:16,216 --> 00:07:18,550
 Mr. Peabody,
how did you escape?

131
00:07:18,718 --> 00:07:19,843
It's simple, Sherman.

132
00:07:19,928 --> 00:07:21,637
I noticed the distance
between the sewer lids...

133
00:07:21,805 --> 00:07:23,055
reasoned that
there must be one

134
00:07:23,223 --> 00:07:24,431
directly under
the guillotine platform...

135
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:26,058
noted the loose board
under the basket...

136
00:07:26,226 --> 00:07:27,267
computed the angle at
which the setting sun

137
00:07:27,393 --> 00:07:28,477
would bounce off
your glasses...

138
00:07:28,645 --> 00:07:30,437
momentarily blinding
the executioner...

139
00:07:30,605 --> 00:07:32,439
and chose that moment
to swipe
the executioner's melon...

140
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:35,609
giving me the added weight
to tip the boards,
facilitating my exit.

141
00:07:35,777 --> 00:07:36,944
That's amazing!

142
00:07:37,111 --> 00:07:38,111
It's not amazing.

143
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:40,572
It was just a matter
of keeping my head.

144
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,491
"Keeping your head."

145
00:07:43,076 --> 00:07:44,159
I don't get it.

146
00:07:44,327 --> 00:07:46,578
There he is!
After them!

147
00:07:46,746 --> 00:07:48,413
Come, Sherman, quick!

148
00:07:52,085 --> 00:07:54,127
 Oh, this
water tastes terrible.

149
00:07:54,462 --> 00:07:56,088
Interestingly,
that's not water.

150
00:07:59,717 --> 00:08:01,301
Ha-ha!

151
00:08:01,761 --> 00:08:02,845
I've got you now.

152
00:08:05,306 --> 00:08:07,516
Indeed you have,
Monsieur Robespierre.

153
00:08:07,684 --> 00:08:10,477
And what a master
of the chase you are.

154
00:08:10,562 --> 00:08:11,687
Oh, you noticed?

155
00:08:11,771 --> 00:08:12,813
Of course.

156
00:08:12,897 --> 00:08:14,356
Doubling back on me
like that.

157
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,524
That was genius.

158
00:08:15,692 --> 00:08:16,692
Thank you.

159
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,777
I just hope you don't take
my little confederate, here.

160
00:08:18,945 --> 00:08:20,445
I depend on him
so completely.

161
00:08:20,613 --> 00:08:21,697
Get over here, you.

162
00:08:21,865 --> 00:08:23,448
Drats!
You're devilishly clever.

163
00:08:23,616 --> 00:08:25,993
I know.
And much quicker
than you as well.

164
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,744
But are you quick
enough for this?

165
00:08:27,829 --> 00:08:29,121
Ha-ha! See? Quick!

166
00:08:29,455 --> 00:08:31,456
Quick, yes,
but not too smart.

167
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:33,834
Oh! Another cantaloupe!

168
00:08:34,294 --> 00:08:35,294
Your sword!

169
00:08:35,795 --> 00:08:37,629
All right, Sherman,
looks like it's time

170
00:08:37,755 --> 00:08:39,506
for a little pop quiz
in the art of fencing.

171
00:08:39,674 --> 00:08:40,799
Go!

172
00:08:40,967 --> 00:08:43,343
Attack! Parry!
Thrust! Repeat!

173
00:08:43,511 --> 00:08:45,137
No.
Remise!

174
00:08:45,221 --> 00:08:46,513
 Good boy!

175
00:08:56,941 --> 00:08:58,483
Oh!

176
00:09:00,403 --> 00:09:01,904
Huh?

177
00:09:02,196 --> 00:09:03,488
Ha-ha! You missed!

178
00:09:03,656 --> 00:09:04,698
I never miss.

179
00:09:09,037 --> 00:09:10,913
 Hop on!

180
00:09:11,331 --> 00:09:12,831
 Whoa!

181
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:15,083
Whoa! Whoa!

182
00:09:15,168 --> 00:09:18,045
Yeah! Whoa!

183
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,590
Yeah!

184
00:09:21,758 --> 00:09:23,133
Do you smell that, Sherman?

185
00:09:23,259 --> 00:09:24,676
It wasn't me, Mr. Peabody.

186
00:09:24,761 --> 00:09:25,761
I know it wasn't you.

187
00:09:25,845 --> 00:09:27,512
It's the methane gas
in the sewer system.

188
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,682
And given
the fact that it ignites
at 306 degrees Fahrenheit...

189
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:31,850
we're about to use it...

190
00:09:32,018 --> 00:09:33,352
to blast out of here!

191
00:09:34,103 --> 00:09:35,687
Hang on!

192
00:09:41,361 --> 00:09:42,861
 Whoo!

193
00:09:45,949 --> 00:09:48,367
Wow!

194
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,209
Nice landing, eh, Sherman?
Oof!

195
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:01,755
So, what did you
learn today, Sherman?

196
00:10:01,923 --> 00:10:04,174
That French Revolution
was crazy.

197
00:10:04,258 --> 00:10:05,342
How so?

198
00:10:05,426 --> 00:10:07,636
All those guys
getting their
heads chopped off...

199
00:10:07,804 --> 00:10:10,389
and nobody standing up
and saying it wasn't right.

200
00:10:10,556 --> 00:10:13,058
And think, Marie Antoinette
could have avoided
the whole revolution...

201
00:10:13,226 --> 00:10:14,726
if she'd simply
issued an edict

202
00:10:14,852 --> 00:10:16,395
to distribute
bread amongst the poor.

203
00:10:16,562 --> 00:10:18,230
But then,
she couldn't have
had her dessert.

204
00:10:18,398 --> 00:10:19,731
Why not, Mr. Peabody?

205
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:21,817
Because, Sherman,
you can't have

206
00:10:21,901 --> 00:10:24,277
your cake and edict, too.

207
00:10:26,072 --> 00:10:27,072
I don't get it.

208
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:39,626
Where are we
gonna go tomorrow,
Mr. Peabody?

209
00:10:39,794 --> 00:10:42,796
Ancient Rome?
The Wild West? 1492?

210
00:10:42,964 --> 00:10:46,508
No, Sherman,
tomorrow we won't be going
to any of those places.

211
00:10:46,592 --> 00:10:47,718
Oh. Why not?

212
00:10:47,802 --> 00:10:48,927
Because
tomorrow's adventure...

213
00:10:49,095 --> 00:10:51,930
is one that you're
going to be taking
all on your own.

214
00:10:52,098 --> 00:10:53,473
What do you mean,
Mr. Peabody?

215
00:10:53,641 --> 00:10:54,641
Don't you remember?

216
00:10:54,809 --> 00:10:56,059
It's your first
day of school.

217
00:10:56,185 --> 00:10:58,311
Oh. Can I drive?
Of course not.

218
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:12,617
PEABODY: Remember, Sherman,
"i" before "e,"
except after "c."

219
00:11:12,785 --> 00:11:14,453
I know, Mr. Peabody!

220
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,538
And don't forget about
the commutative principle.

221
00:11:16,706 --> 00:11:18,206
Two plus three
equals three plus two.

222
00:11:18,374 --> 00:11:20,042
I know, Mr. Peabody!

223
00:11:20,209 --> 00:11:21,209
And if you have to
go to the bathroom...

224
00:11:21,377 --> 00:11:23,670
just raise your hand proudly
and say, "I have to go."

225
00:11:23,838 --> 00:11:25,505
I will, Mr. Peabody.

226
00:11:25,673 --> 00:11:28,383
And remember,
the No. 2 pencil is
standard for most uses...

227
00:11:28,551 --> 00:11:30,802
but there are times
when a No. 1 comes in handy.

228
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:32,387
I left a little pencil chart
in your backpack...

229
00:11:32,555 --> 00:11:35,140
which you can consult
if it ever
becomes a judgment call.

230
00:11:35,308 --> 00:11:38,351
 I think
I'll be okay!

231
00:11:41,147 --> 00:11:42,147
Okay, bye, Mr. Peabody.

232
00:11:42,231 --> 00:11:43,273
 Wait.

233
00:11:43,357 --> 00:11:44,524
See you after school.
Sherman!

234
00:11:44,692 --> 00:11:47,652
I gotta go. I gotta
sign up for the clubs.

235
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,571
No one is more in
favor of participation

236
00:11:49,697 --> 00:11:51,490
in fraternal
organizations than I.

237
00:11:51,657 --> 00:11:54,868
But before you go,
I want you to have this.

238
00:11:55,328 --> 00:11:56,870
Thanks. What is it?

239
00:11:57,038 --> 00:11:58,705
A dog whistle.

240
00:12:03,503 --> 00:12:06,004
It doesn't work,
Mr. Peabody.

241
00:12:06,172 --> 00:12:09,382
 It works
fine, Sherman.

242
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:12,052
It's just a frequency
only dogs can hear.

243
00:12:12,678 --> 00:12:13,762
Oh, cool.

244
00:12:13,846 --> 00:12:16,389
Let that little keepsake
be a reminder to you...

245
00:12:16,557 --> 00:12:18,683
that no matter what
challenges you face,

246
00:12:18,851 --> 00:12:20,936
no matter how far
away I might seem...

247
00:12:21,104 --> 00:12:23,355
Bye, Mr. Peabody!

248
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,777
...I'm with you.

249
00:12:36,244 --> 00:12:37,953
 George Washington.

250
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,206
Who can tell me who he is?

251
00:12:41,374 --> 00:12:43,250
Oh, me! I can! I can!

252
00:12:43,334 --> 00:12:45,418
Uh... Sherman.

253
00:12:45,586 --> 00:12:48,380
The first president
of the United
States of America.

254
00:12:48,548 --> 00:12:49,714
 Good job.

255
00:12:49,882 --> 00:12:52,759
And when President Washington
was a little boy...

256
00:12:52,927 --> 00:12:55,762
what kind of tree
did he cut down?

257
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:57,055
Ooh! Ooh, me! Me! Me!

258
00:12:57,223 --> 00:12:59,099
 Penny?
A cherry tree.

259
00:12:59,267 --> 00:13:00,350
Apocryphal.

260
00:13:00,476 --> 00:13:01,560
What kind of
tree is that?

261
00:13:01,727 --> 00:13:03,979
It's not a tree.
It's a word.
"Apocryphal."

262
00:13:04,147 --> 00:13:05,814
It means that
story is not true.

263
00:13:05,982 --> 00:13:07,566
Really?
Yeah.

264
00:13:07,733 --> 00:13:09,651
George Washington
never cut down
a cherry tree...

265
00:13:09,819 --> 00:13:11,403
and he never said
he couldn't lie.

266
00:13:11,571 --> 00:13:14,406
People made those
stories up to teach kids
a lesson about lying...

267
00:13:14,574 --> 00:13:15,532
but they're not true.

268
00:13:15,616 --> 00:13:16,867
He did cross
the Delaware River,

269
00:13:16,951 --> 00:13:19,578
Christmas night,
1776, though.

270
00:13:19,912 --> 00:13:22,164
My dad took me
there this summer.
We crossed it, too.

271
00:13:22,331 --> 00:13:24,332
I fell in.

272
00:13:25,501 --> 00:13:29,629
Looks like someone
really knows their
history, huh, Penny?

273
00:13:36,095 --> 00:13:37,470
 It's really great
meeting you guys.

274
00:13:37,597 --> 00:13:39,514
Maybe you can come over
to my house sometime.

275
00:13:39,682 --> 00:13:42,475
I could bring my new model.
It's a hydrogen atom.

276
00:13:42,643 --> 00:13:44,269
You've only got one, huh?

277
00:13:44,437 --> 00:13:46,229
Guess we'll
have to split it.

278
00:13:47,481 --> 00:13:48,481
 Good one!

279
00:13:50,526 --> 00:13:51,943
Check it, guys.

280
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,198
What do you got there,
Sherman?

281
00:13:56,365 --> 00:13:57,657
Kibbles or bits?

282
00:13:57,825 --> 00:13:59,993
Actually,
I've got baby carrots,

283
00:14:00,119 --> 00:14:02,287
organic apple juice,
and a tuna sandwich.

284
00:14:03,331 --> 00:14:05,874
It's super-high
in omega-3s.

285
00:14:06,042 --> 00:14:08,627
So, you eat
human food, huh?

286
00:14:08,794 --> 00:14:10,295
Yeah. Why wouldn't I?

287
00:14:10,463 --> 00:14:11,546
Because you're a dog.

288
00:14:11,714 --> 00:14:12,797
No, I'm not.

289
00:14:12,965 --> 00:14:16,134
Sure you are.
Your dad is a dog,
so you're a dog, too.

290
00:14:16,302 --> 00:14:18,637
I think you're confused.
It's an adoptive
relationship.

291
00:14:18,804 --> 00:14:20,305
Zip it, Carl.
Okay.

292
00:14:20,473 --> 00:14:22,641
Here, I'll show you.
Fetch!

293
00:14:25,144 --> 00:14:27,229
Go on, doggy.
Go get your lunch.

294
00:14:27,313 --> 00:14:28,313
Go on.

295
00:14:28,397 --> 00:14:29,397
Go get it.

296
00:14:31,067 --> 00:14:33,151
Ugh. The humiliation.

297
00:14:33,319 --> 00:14:35,987
 Sherman,
go get your food.

298
00:14:36,155 --> 00:14:38,031
Make like
a good little doggy.

299
00:14:45,665 --> 00:14:47,374
What's this?
It's mine!

300
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:49,000
Give it back!

301
00:14:49,126 --> 00:14:51,169
What is it? A whistle?

302
00:14:52,338 --> 00:14:54,464
Ugh! Stupid thing
doesn't even work.

303
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,091
It's a dog
whistle, Penny.

304
00:14:56,259 --> 00:14:58,677
It operates at a frequency
that only dogs can hear.

305
00:14:58,844 --> 00:15:00,428
Back up, Carl.
Okay.

306
00:15:00,596 --> 00:15:02,889
Penny, that whistle
is my private property.

307
00:15:03,057 --> 00:15:05,016
Give it back!
Jump, doggy,
jump. 

308
00:15:05,184 --> 00:15:06,351
I am not a dog.

309
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:07,519
Come on, Sherman!

310
00:15:07,687 --> 00:15:10,355
Just admit it.
You're a dog. Say it.

311
00:15:10,523 --> 00:15:11,564
 Let me go!

312
00:15:11,732 --> 00:15:14,192
Not until you beg like a dog.

313
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,111
Come on, Sherman. Beg!

314
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:18,863
Fight, fight, fight!

315
00:15:20,533 --> 00:15:24,369
Mr. Peabody,
thank you for coming in
on such short notice...

316
00:15:24,537 --> 00:15:26,705
to discuss
the problem with Sherman.

317
00:15:26,872 --> 00:15:28,707
Oh, it's not a problem
at all, Principal Purdy.

318
00:15:28,874 --> 00:15:30,041
I fully expected this.

319
00:15:30,209 --> 00:15:31,209
You did?
Yes.

320
00:15:31,377 --> 00:15:33,670
And, as with all
things Sherman-related,
I prepared for it.

321
00:15:33,838 --> 00:15:35,171
Here's a curriculum
that takes Sherman's

322
00:15:35,298 --> 00:15:36,673
advanced preparation
into account...

323
00:15:36,841 --> 00:15:38,508
but won't require you
to have him skip
one or more grades.

324
00:15:38,592 --> 00:15:39,592
Mr. Peabody...

325
00:15:39,677 --> 00:15:42,053
Here are some
pre-algebra worksheets,
an advanced reading list...

326
00:15:42,221 --> 00:15:43,972
and a link to
a website I created

327
00:15:44,098 --> 00:15:45,849
so he can start
studying Mandarin Chinese.

328
00:15:46,017 --> 00:15:47,559
It is, after all,
the language of the future.

329
00:15:47,727 --> 00:15:48,727
Mr. Peabody!

330
00:15:48,811 --> 00:15:50,812
I'm not saying he
shouldn't study French,
too, Principal Purdy.

331
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,063
I'm saying
have him do both.

332
00:15:52,231 --> 00:15:53,231
Mr. Peabody!

333
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:55,066
What? Not enough? Swahili?

334
00:15:57,069 --> 00:15:58,820
Sherman got
into a fight today.

335
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:00,739
Oh, dear.

336
00:16:01,574 --> 00:16:02,907
Pictures were taken...

337
00:16:03,075 --> 00:16:05,243
for insurance purposes.

338
00:16:12,585 --> 00:16:14,336
 He bit her.

339
00:16:15,212 --> 00:16:19,591
I must say,
it doesn't look good
for you, Mr. Peabody.

340
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,844
After all, you are a dog.

341
00:16:23,012 --> 00:16:24,846
Who, may I ask, are you?

342
00:16:25,014 --> 00:16:28,516
I am Ms. Grunion from
the Bureau of Child
Safety and Protection.

343
00:16:28,684 --> 00:16:32,437
We're required by
law to contact them
whenever there's an...

344
00:16:33,439 --> 00:16:34,439
incident.

345
00:16:35,107 --> 00:16:37,609
Sherman has never done
anything like this before.

346
00:16:37,777 --> 00:16:39,277
I'm sure he must
have had a reason.

347
00:16:39,445 --> 00:16:41,237
Well, the girl was being
a bit of a bully...

348
00:16:41,405 --> 00:16:42,614
 Quiet, Purdy!

349
00:16:42,782 --> 00:16:45,033
It's normal for
children to tease.

350
00:16:45,201 --> 00:16:47,702
It's not normal
for them to bite.

351
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:50,538
Clearly, it's because of
how he's being raised.

352
00:16:50,706 --> 00:16:53,375
In my opinion,
a dog can never be

353
00:16:53,501 --> 00:16:56,211
a suitable parent
to a little boy.

354
00:16:56,379 --> 00:16:57,629
I must point out,
Ms. Grunion...

355
00:16:57,797 --> 00:16:59,547
that I won
the right to adopt Sherman

356
00:16:59,632 --> 00:17:00,799
in a court of law.

357
00:17:00,966 --> 00:17:03,718
And the court can
take it away from you.

358
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:08,306
I'll be coming to your
home tomorrow evening
to conduct an investigation.

359
00:17:08,474 --> 00:17:12,102
If I discover that
you are, in any way,
an unfit parent...

360
00:17:12,269 --> 00:17:15,980
I will see to it
Sherman is removed
from your custody.

361
00:17:21,278 --> 00:17:22,779
Permanently.

362
00:17:23,322 --> 00:17:26,616
I hope I've made
myself clear.

363
00:17:30,246 --> 00:17:31,413
Crystal.

364
00:17:33,499 --> 00:17:36,126
 I'm sorry
I bit her, Mr. Peabody.

365
00:17:36,293 --> 00:17:37,669
I won't do it again.

366
00:17:37,837 --> 00:17:39,295
You're darn tooting
you won't do it again.

367
00:17:39,463 --> 00:17:42,340
This kind of wanton violence
is totally unacceptable.

368
00:17:42,508 --> 00:17:45,760
And rather uncharacteristic,
given how you feel
about Mr. Gandhi.

369
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:48,304
What on earth provoked it?

370
00:17:51,976 --> 00:17:54,644
 She called me
a dog.

371
00:18:01,861 --> 00:18:04,154
Well, all right then.

372
00:18:06,282 --> 00:18:07,949
Thank you for telling me.

373
00:18:09,034 --> 00:18:10,869
Try and get some sleep.

374
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,500
I love you, Mr. Peabody.

375
00:18:18,878 --> 00:18:21,838
I have a deep regard
for you as well, Sherman.

376
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,282
Close your eyes

377
00:18:52,328 --> 00:18:54,204
Have no fear

378
00:18:56,123 --> 00:18:59,918
The master's gone
He's on the run

379
00:19:00,002 --> 00:19:02,337
And your daddy's here

380
00:19:05,049 --> 00:19:08,843
Beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful, beautiful boy

381
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,946
Say a little prayer

382
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:34,452
Every day,
in every way

383
00:19:34,578 --> 00:19:37,372
It's getting
better and better

384
00:19:39,542 --> 00:19:44,754
Beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful, beautiful boy

385
00:19:48,676 --> 00:19:53,471
Beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful, beautiful boy

386
00:19:57,226 --> 00:19:59,561
A hard road to hoe

387
00:20:00,187 --> 00:20:03,606
Yes, it's a long way to go

388
00:20:04,066 --> 00:20:06,776
But in the meantime

389
00:20:13,867 --> 00:20:15,994
Take my hand

390
00:20:19,915 --> 00:20:24,002
Life is what happens
to you while you're busy
making other plans

391
00:20:26,714 --> 00:20:32,176
Beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful, beautiful boy

392
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:40,685
Beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful, beautiful boy

393
00:20:43,147 --> 00:20:44,272
Mr. Peabody...

394
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,482
you are
a Nobel Prize-winning
scientist.

395
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:48,192
An advisor to
heads of state.

396
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,111
A captain of industry.

397
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:52,780
Why would you
want to adopt a boy?

398
00:20:52,948 --> 00:20:54,449
Because, Your Honor...

399
00:20:54,617 --> 00:21:00,204
when I found Sherman,
it reminded me of how
I started out in life.

400
00:21:00,372 --> 00:21:04,208
And now, I want to give him
the one thing I always wanted.

401
00:21:04,376 --> 00:21:05,627
A home.

402
00:21:05,794 --> 00:21:08,379
And you're sure you're
capable of meeting
all the challenges...

403
00:21:08,547 --> 00:21:10,340
of raising a human boy?

404
00:21:10,549 --> 00:21:13,718
With all due respect,
how hard could it be?

405
00:21:15,721 --> 00:21:16,888
Very well, then.

406
00:21:17,056 --> 00:21:19,057
If a boy can adopt a dog...

407
00:21:19,224 --> 00:21:22,894
I see no reason
why a dog cannot adopt a boy.

408
00:21:27,066 --> 00:21:28,566
Da-da!

409
00:21:28,734 --> 00:21:30,193
No, Sherman, not "Da-da."

410
00:21:30,361 --> 00:21:32,570
You shall call me
"Mr. Peabody."

411
00:21:32,738 --> 00:21:35,406
Or, in less formal moments,
simply "Peabody."

412
00:21:36,909 --> 00:21:38,076
That's right.

413
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:39,911
"Mr. Pea-baba."

414
00:21:40,663 --> 00:21:45,291
Beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful, beautiful boy

415
00:22:22,454 --> 00:22:23,538
What's cooking, Mr. Peabody?

416
00:22:23,664 --> 00:22:24,789
Oh, nothing much.

417
00:22:24,957 --> 00:22:28,126
Just a little Dungeness
crab with a passion-fruit
basil concassé.

418
00:22:28,293 --> 00:22:30,253
Some truffled quails
in a juniper-berry reduction.

419
00:22:30,421 --> 00:22:32,255
And Baked Alaska.

420
00:22:32,423 --> 00:22:35,049
Wow! Is today some
kind of special occasion?

421
00:22:35,134 --> 00:22:36,134
You could say.

422
00:22:36,218 --> 00:22:37,510
It's not my birthday.

423
00:22:37,636 --> 00:22:38,928
No, it isn't.

424
00:22:39,096 --> 00:22:40,179
It's not your birthday.

425
00:22:40,305 --> 00:22:41,472
Right again.

426
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,641
It's not Father's Day.
Is it?

427
00:22:43,809 --> 00:22:46,144
Nope. It's not Father's Day.

428
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:48,604
Is the president
coming to dinner again?

429
00:22:48,772 --> 00:22:50,565
No.
Oh.

430
00:22:50,941 --> 00:22:52,275
So, who's coming
to dinner?

431
00:22:52,443 --> 00:22:54,819
Let's just say,
if the evening
is a success...

432
00:22:54,987 --> 00:22:57,655
we can put this whole
"biting" business behind us.

433
00:23:04,747 --> 00:23:07,415
The Petersons! Welcome.

434
00:23:07,583 --> 00:23:08,666
So, he's
literally a dog.

435
00:23:08,834 --> 00:23:09,917
Paul!

436
00:23:10,085 --> 00:23:11,085
No, that's all right.

437
00:23:11,253 --> 00:23:13,963
Although,
I prefer "literate dog."

438
00:23:14,047 --> 00:23:15,256
 That's funny.

439
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,674
Isn't that funny, Paul?

440
00:23:17,968 --> 00:23:19,886
 He's not
a big laugher.

441
00:23:20,429 --> 00:23:22,638
We're so delighted
you could make it
on such short notice.

442
00:23:22,806 --> 00:23:26,851
Aren't we, Sherman?

443
00:23:27,019 --> 00:23:30,354
Yeah, we're interested
in what's going on,
that's for sure.

444
00:23:30,522 --> 00:23:32,356
Say hello to
Penny, Sherman.

445
00:23:32,524 --> 00:23:33,983
Hi, Penny.

446
00:23:34,276 --> 00:23:35,651
Hello, Sherman.

447
00:23:35,819 --> 00:23:37,361
Now, why don't
you go show Penny

448
00:23:37,529 --> 00:23:39,113
your mineral collection,
Sherman?

449
00:23:39,281 --> 00:23:40,823
I'm sure she'll find
those new geodes

450
00:23:40,908 --> 00:23:42,533
of yours fascinating.

451
00:23:43,285 --> 00:23:44,619
Come on.

452
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,707
I am so glad you
accepted my invitation.

453
00:23:49,875 --> 00:23:53,211
Now, the kids can
resolve their differences
before Ms. Grunion arrives.

454
00:23:53,378 --> 00:23:55,630
You're barking up
the wrong tree, mister.
In fact...

455
00:23:55,798 --> 00:23:58,049
if it weren't for Patty,
I would have pressed
charges already.

456
00:23:58,217 --> 00:23:59,509
And I have to
tell you, Peabody...

457
00:23:59,676 --> 00:24:01,135
where my daughter
is concerned,

458
00:24:01,261 --> 00:24:02,720
nothing is more
important than...

459
00:24:02,888 --> 00:24:05,348
Hello. Sure,
I'll take a survey.

460
00:24:14,358 --> 00:24:15,983
Everything going
swimmingly?

461
00:24:16,068 --> 00:24:17,235
Ugh.

462
00:24:17,569 --> 00:24:19,987
Why didn't you tell me
she was coming over here?

463
00:24:20,155 --> 00:24:22,240
Because I didn't
want you to worry.

464
00:24:22,407 --> 00:24:24,575
Okay, because I
didn't want to listen
to your bellyaching.

465
00:24:24,743 --> 00:24:27,203
Thank you for your honesty.

466
00:24:27,371 --> 00:24:28,329
You're welcome.

467
00:24:28,413 --> 00:24:31,082
I don't know what you
think we're supposed to
do in here anyway.

468
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,667
She hates me.

469
00:24:32,835 --> 00:24:34,877
Share your interests.
Tell a witty anecdote.

470
00:24:35,045 --> 00:24:36,087
Mr. Peabody...

471
00:24:36,255 --> 00:24:37,672
I hate her.

472
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,715
Sherman,
every great relationship...

473
00:24:39,883 --> 00:24:41,259
starts from
a place of conflict,

474
00:24:41,385 --> 00:24:42,760
and evolves into
something richer.

475
00:24:44,513 --> 00:24:45,847
Bonne chance.

476
00:24:47,057 --> 00:24:48,349
Make it work.

477
00:24:49,017 --> 00:24:50,601
But don't tell her
about the WABAC.

478
00:24:54,356 --> 00:24:57,441
 Don't even
think about it.

479
00:24:57,943 --> 00:24:59,443
Ah.

480
00:25:11,623 --> 00:25:13,541
 Peabody,
that was amazing!

481
00:25:13,792 --> 00:25:15,626
Paul, wasn't that amazing?

482
00:25:15,794 --> 00:25:17,086
I'm more into
rock-'n'-roll.

483
00:25:23,093 --> 00:25:24,468
I meant flamenco.

484
00:25:31,435 --> 00:25:32,435
Bagpipes?

485
00:25:33,437 --> 00:25:34,729
Uh, didgeridoo.

486
00:25:38,317 --> 00:25:39,317
Sitar.

487
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:40,776
Steel drums.

488
00:25:40,944 --> 00:25:41,986
Trombone.

489
00:25:42,154 --> 00:25:43,446
Xylophone.

490
00:25:43,614 --> 00:25:44,614
Djembe?

491
00:25:44,781 --> 00:25:45,823
Calliope.

492
00:25:45,991 --> 00:25:47,450
Oboe. Piccolo.

493
00:25:47,618 --> 00:25:49,076
Tuba. Dobro.

494
00:25:49,244 --> 00:25:50,411
Slide whistle. Yodeling.

495
00:25:50,579 --> 00:25:51,621
Hurdy-gurdy. Ocarina.

496
00:25:51,788 --> 00:25:52,997
Harmonium. Musical saw.

497
00:25:53,165 --> 00:25:54,999
You know what?
This has been great...

498
00:25:55,167 --> 00:25:57,251
but a complete
waste of time.

499
00:25:57,419 --> 00:26:00,004
Now, let's get Penny
and go home!

500
00:26:00,172 --> 00:26:01,255
Are you all right, Paul?

501
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,966
I'm... fine.

502
00:26:04,134 --> 00:26:05,593
 This happens
whenever he's tense.

503
00:26:05,761 --> 00:26:06,761
Paul, if I might...

504
00:26:06,845 --> 00:26:07,970
Stay away
from me, Peabody!

505
00:26:08,138 --> 00:26:10,514
Just get back!
I need traction.

506
00:26:10,682 --> 00:26:13,768
You can trust me, Paul.
I'm a licensed chiropractor.

507
00:26:13,852 --> 00:26:15,269
Ow! Huh.

508
00:26:23,195 --> 00:26:25,446
Ooh...

509
00:26:26,448 --> 00:26:27,949
Ah...

510
00:26:28,367 --> 00:26:29,700
Peabody...

511
00:26:29,868 --> 00:26:31,160
I feel great.

512
00:26:31,244 --> 00:26:33,955
I... 
I really feel great!

513
00:26:34,206 --> 00:26:36,457
 Peabody,
you're a miracle worker.

514
00:26:37,709 --> 00:26:39,710
Ha-ha! Look at me!

515
00:26:39,836 --> 00:26:41,379
I'm dancing!

516
00:26:43,548 --> 00:26:44,632
You know, Penny...

517
00:26:44,716 --> 00:26:47,176
Sigmund Freud says
if you don't like a person...

518
00:26:47,344 --> 00:26:51,013
it's because they remind
you of something you
don't like about yourself.

519
00:26:51,181 --> 00:26:52,974
What do you know
about Sigmund Freud?

520
00:26:53,141 --> 00:26:54,225
More than you think.

521
00:26:54,393 --> 00:26:56,852
Sure.
Just like you know
all that stuff...

522
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:00,564
about George Washington
not really cutting
down the cherry tree.

523
00:27:00,732 --> 00:27:01,899
Ugh. What a crock.

524
00:27:02,067 --> 00:27:03,067
But it's true!

525
00:27:03,235 --> 00:27:04,860
How do you know?
I just know!

526
00:27:05,028 --> 00:27:06,404
Did you read it in a book?
No!

527
00:27:06,571 --> 00:27:07,697
See it in a movie?
No!

528
00:27:07,864 --> 00:27:08,864
Did your brainiac
dad tell you?

529
00:27:08,991 --> 00:27:09,991
No!

530
00:27:10,158 --> 00:27:11,200
So, how do
you know, Sherman?

531
00:27:11,368 --> 00:27:12,660
How do you know?

532
00:27:12,744 --> 00:27:13,911
He told me.

533
00:27:13,996 --> 00:27:15,037
Who told you?

534
00:27:15,122 --> 00:27:16,664
George Washington.

535
00:27:18,417 --> 00:27:19,834
George Washington?

536
00:27:21,253 --> 00:27:22,503
Yeah.

537
00:27:22,921 --> 00:27:24,088
Ugh! Liar.

538
00:27:27,592 --> 00:27:29,427
But don't tell
her about the WABAC.

539
00:27:30,595 --> 00:27:32,179
He calls it the "WABAC."

540
00:27:32,347 --> 00:27:34,098
So, where have
you gone in it?

541
00:27:34,266 --> 00:27:36,726
Not "where," Penny, "when."

542
00:27:36,893 --> 00:27:39,395
Okay, smart guy, when?

543
00:27:39,563 --> 00:27:44,233
Oh, 1965, 1776, 1620...

544
00:27:44,401 --> 00:27:48,112
1492, 1215, 4.

545
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,239
Can it go back to an hour ago?
Why?

546
00:27:50,407 --> 00:27:52,742
Because I could take it home,
pretend to be sick...

547
00:27:52,909 --> 00:27:54,785
and not come to
this lame dinner party.

548
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:57,830
Ha-ha. Mr. Peabody says
you should never
use the WABAC...

549
00:27:58,081 --> 00:28:00,124
to travel to
a time when you existed.

550
00:28:00,292 --> 00:28:01,333
How come?

551
00:28:01,418 --> 00:28:02,376
There would be two of you.

552
00:28:02,461 --> 00:28:04,295
Oh, yeah.

553
00:28:04,463 --> 00:28:06,213
I guess the world's
not ready for that.

554
00:28:09,968 --> 00:28:11,385
Wow.

555
00:28:12,304 --> 00:28:15,347
Um, well, now that
we've seen it, maybe
we should go back.

556
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:18,642
Are you kidding?
Where should we go first?

557
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:22,480
 Mr. Peabody says
I'm not allowed to
drive it till I'm older.

558
00:28:22,647 --> 00:28:24,899
Do you do everything
Mr. Peabody says?

559
00:28:25,067 --> 00:28:26,150
Yeah.

560
00:28:26,318 --> 00:28:28,110
You know what that
makes you, Sherman.

561
00:28:28,278 --> 00:28:30,112
An obedient son?

562
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,405
Nope.

563
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:32,782
A dog.

564
00:28:46,004 --> 00:28:47,838
Ooh!
Nice control.

565
00:28:48,673 --> 00:28:50,299
Look at him go!
Take it, Patty!

566
00:28:51,468 --> 00:28:52,676
 Heads up, Paul!
Whoa!

567
00:28:52,969 --> 00:28:55,262
Here you go. Zing!

568
00:28:59,518 --> 00:29:01,268
Oh, yeah.

569
00:29:02,104 --> 00:29:03,687
Oh! 
Hey, look at that.

570
00:29:03,855 --> 00:29:05,439
This is fun!

571
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:11,320
This is a little
homespun concoction
I like to call...

572
00:29:12,697 --> 00:29:14,198
"Einstein on the Beach."

573
00:29:14,366 --> 00:29:15,616
 Yummy.

574
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,203
To the kids.

575
00:29:19,371 --> 00:29:21,163
 To the kids!

576
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,541
Mr. Peabody.

577
00:29:23,792 --> 00:29:25,000
Sherman?

578
00:29:25,127 --> 00:29:26,293
Can I talk to
you a second?

579
00:29:26,378 --> 00:29:27,545
Of course.

580
00:29:27,629 --> 00:29:29,004
Excuse me.

581
00:29:33,468 --> 00:29:35,136
I've really hit it off
with Penny's parents.

582
00:29:35,303 --> 00:29:38,347
I think we can file this night
under "Unqualified Success."

583
00:29:38,515 --> 00:29:41,225
Uh, I would hold off
filing it just yet.

584
00:29:41,393 --> 00:29:43,727
What do you mean?
Where's Penny?

585
00:29:43,895 --> 00:29:45,855
Uh... Ancient Egypt.

586
00:29:45,981 --> 00:29:48,232
 You used the WABAC?

587
00:29:49,568 --> 00:29:51,861
 What's happening,
big guy? We're running low.

588
00:29:54,698 --> 00:29:56,699
I'll be right there, Paul.

589
00:29:56,867 --> 00:29:58,033
How could you do
such a thing?

590
00:29:58,118 --> 00:29:59,243
She called me a liar...

591
00:29:59,327 --> 00:30:00,452
for saying
George Washington

592
00:30:00,537 --> 00:30:02,329
never cut down
a cherry tree.

593
00:30:02,497 --> 00:30:04,748
So, you took her
to see George Washington?

594
00:30:04,916 --> 00:30:06,917
Yeah. She was into it.

595
00:30:07,085 --> 00:30:08,586
 Hey, Pea-buddy.

596
00:30:08,753 --> 00:30:09,753
Hey.

597
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,838
Where's Penny?

598
00:30:10,922 --> 00:30:12,381
Playing hide-and-seek.
Pooping.

599
00:30:12,549 --> 00:30:14,383
Pooping.
Playing hide and seek.

600
00:30:16,052 --> 00:30:17,845
Well, which is it?
Uh...

601
00:30:18,597 --> 00:30:19,889
Hey, what's going on here?

602
00:30:20,056 --> 00:30:21,724
Yeah. What's going on here?

603
00:30:21,892 --> 00:30:23,184
What have you done with Penny?
Penny?

604
00:30:23,351 --> 00:30:24,852
Penny? Penny!

605
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,937
Oh, my gosh!
Where's our daughter?

606
00:30:27,189 --> 00:30:29,648
It's hard to say, Paul.

607
00:30:29,858 --> 00:30:34,778
She could be here, or here,
or here, or here...

608
00:30:34,946 --> 00:30:36,155
or here.

609
00:30:38,074 --> 00:30:39,366
That will hold them.

610
00:30:39,534 --> 00:30:40,784
I learned that
trick from a swami

611
00:30:40,952 --> 00:30:42,203
at the Begawan Giri
in Ubud, Bali.

612
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:43,704
Let's go!

613
00:30:57,761 --> 00:31:00,721
 Ancient Egypt.
Land of the Pharaohs.

614
00:31:00,805 --> 00:31:03,641
A beacon of progress
on the horizon of humanity...

615
00:31:03,808 --> 00:31:07,478
but a cruel and
barbarous civilization
just the same.

616
00:31:07,646 --> 00:31:10,648
I just hope
Penny isn't suffering
too badly.

617
00:31:22,494 --> 00:31:23,827
 I got it.

618
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:25,287
What are you doing here?

619
00:31:25,455 --> 00:31:27,331
We have come
to take you home.

620
00:31:27,999 --> 00:31:30,167
Ugh! What's the Egyptian word
for "tattletale"?

621
00:31:31,586 --> 00:31:34,296
But that's beside the point.
Get your clothes on,
we're going home.

622
00:31:34,464 --> 00:31:36,507
Who died and
made you Pharaoh?

623
00:31:36,675 --> 00:31:38,592
Now, bring on
the mani-pedi.

624
00:31:39,135 --> 00:31:41,804
See, Mr. Peabody?
Lmpossible!

625
00:31:41,972 --> 00:31:43,681
Indeed,
but watch what happens...

626
00:31:43,848 --> 00:31:47,101
when an immovable object
meets an irresistible force.

627
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,602
Penny...

628
00:31:48,687 --> 00:31:50,813
come here, right now.
Penny, come!

629
00:31:50,981 --> 00:31:52,690
I'm not Penny anymore.

630
00:31:52,857 --> 00:31:57,361
Now, I'm Princess Hatsheput,
precious flower of the Nile.

631
00:31:57,529 --> 00:31:58,612
"Precious," perhaps,
but if you think

632
00:31:58,738 --> 00:31:59,863
"we're going to
leave you here...

633
00:32:00,031 --> 00:32:02,283
you are most
definitely in "de-Nile."

634
00:32:03,952 --> 00:32:05,119
I don't get it.

635
00:32:05,203 --> 00:32:06,203
Now, come along.

636
00:32:06,371 --> 00:32:07,663
 Unhand her!

637
00:32:08,832 --> 00:32:11,333
What's the matter,
my sweet little
desert blossom?

638
00:32:11,501 --> 00:32:13,711
Are these barbarians
bothering you?

639
00:32:13,878 --> 00:32:16,463
As a matter of
fact, they are.

640
00:32:16,631 --> 00:32:18,048
Bow, barbarians.

641
00:32:18,216 --> 00:32:20,217
As you wish, Your Highness.

642
00:32:20,385 --> 00:32:22,219
Who's that, Mr. Peabody?

643
00:32:22,387 --> 00:32:24,805
That, Sherman, is
the living image of Amun...

644
00:32:24,973 --> 00:32:28,058
son of Akhenaten,
lord of the 18th Dynasty
of the New Kingdom...

645
00:32:28,226 --> 00:32:29,351
King Tutankhamun.

646
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,312
Otherwise known
as "King Tut."

647
00:32:31,396 --> 00:32:32,521
My boyfriend.

648
00:32:32,564 --> 00:32:35,316
King Tut is
your boyfriend?
Mmm-hmm.

649
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,735
Would you like me
to have them skinned,
covered with honey...

650
00:32:37,902 --> 00:32:40,195
and laid in
a pit of fire ants?

651
00:32:40,905 --> 00:32:42,323
You would do that for me?

652
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:45,576
Anything, my desert flower.
Consider it a wedding gift.

653
00:32:45,744 --> 00:32:48,203
What? You can't
marry this guy!

654
00:32:48,288 --> 00:32:49,330
Why not?

655
00:32:49,414 --> 00:32:52,207
Well, for one,
his name rhymes
with "butt."

656
00:32:52,375 --> 00:32:55,336
I don't care.
I'm gonna have a big,
fat, Egyptian wedding.

657
00:32:55,503 --> 00:32:57,755
Spoiler alert,
King Tut dies young.

658
00:32:57,922 --> 00:32:59,757
Are you sure you've
thought this through?

659
00:32:59,924 --> 00:33:02,259
Oh, trust me,
I've thought it through.
I'm getting everything.

660
00:33:02,427 --> 00:33:04,178
The royal astronomers
have decreed...

661
00:33:04,554 --> 00:33:07,473
the wedding must take
place tomorrow at dawn.

662
00:33:07,557 --> 00:33:08,599
Who is he?

663
00:33:08,683 --> 00:33:09,892
He is Ay.
He is you?

664
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:12,895
I am Ay. The Grand Vizier.

665
00:33:13,271 --> 00:33:15,105
Yeah, that's his name.
Oh.

666
00:33:15,357 --> 00:33:18,400
Oh, Grand Vizier,
would you mind telling
the precious princess, here...

667
00:33:18,568 --> 00:33:21,111
precisely what it means
to marry the young Pharaoh.

668
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:22,279
Gladly.

669
00:33:22,447 --> 00:33:25,616
It means she
will be bound to him
in eternity...

670
00:33:25,784 --> 00:33:27,451
through the sacred
ceremonies

671
00:33:27,535 --> 00:33:30,454
of disembowelment
and mummification...

672
00:33:30,789 --> 00:33:32,748
as described in
the holy texts.

673
00:33:33,124 --> 00:33:34,458
Um, hold up a second.

674
00:33:34,626 --> 00:33:36,293
Can you walk me
through that, somebody?

675
00:33:36,461 --> 00:33:39,546
What he means, Penny,
is that when I die
they'll kill you, too.

676
00:33:39,714 --> 00:33:42,383
And then they'll rip out
your organs, stuff them
in canopic jars...

677
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:44,093
and then mummify
whatever is left.

678
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,302
Okay, I'm seeing this now.

679
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:48,263
Thank you.
I'm going to go with them.

680
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:51,308
There's no turning back now.

681
00:33:51,601 --> 00:33:52,601
To the palace!

682
00:33:52,769 --> 00:33:54,603
Let the wedding
preparations begin!

683
00:33:55,105 --> 00:33:57,231
Mr. Peabody! Sherman!

684
00:33:57,399 --> 00:33:58,399
Do something!

685
00:33:58,566 --> 00:33:59,566
Don't worry, Penny!

686
00:33:59,734 --> 00:34:00,901
We'll save you!

687
00:34:05,407 --> 00:34:06,990
Hey, wait! You can't just...

688
00:34:08,201 --> 00:34:09,868
Leave us here.

689
00:34:10,328 --> 00:34:11,495
Mr. Peabody?

690
00:34:11,663 --> 00:34:12,704
Yes, Sherman?

691
00:34:12,872 --> 00:34:13,997
 Can
I hold your hand?

692
00:34:14,165 --> 00:34:15,874
 Of course you can.

693
00:34:16,042 --> 00:34:18,502
Boy, your hand
is cold, Mr. Peabody.

694
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:20,170
Sherman?
Yeah?

695
00:34:21,673 --> 00:34:22,673
That's not my hand.

696
00:34:29,055 --> 00:34:30,681
That's disarming.

697
00:34:30,849 --> 00:34:33,767
Now, to find
a way out of here.

698
00:34:33,852 --> 00:34:34,935
Yuck!

699
00:34:35,019 --> 00:34:36,353
Look around, Sherman.

700
00:34:36,521 --> 00:34:38,689
These tombs
are lined with
hieroglyphics...

701
00:34:38,857 --> 00:34:40,983
designed to assist
the pharaohs' souls

702
00:34:41,109 --> 00:34:43,235
in their journey
to the afterlife.

703
00:34:43,403 --> 00:34:46,530
And they may
assist us as well.

704
00:34:48,533 --> 00:34:50,117
Oh, this depicts
the god Anubis

705
00:34:50,201 --> 00:34:52,286
sailing the boat of Ra
to the underworld.

706
00:34:52,454 --> 00:34:55,914
It appears the boats of Ra
are the key to our escape.

707
00:34:56,082 --> 00:34:58,208
We must find them in time
to stop the wedding.

708
00:34:58,376 --> 00:35:00,919
Well, if you ask me,
we should let her
marry that guy.

709
00:35:01,087 --> 00:35:02,254
They deserve each other.

710
00:35:02,422 --> 00:35:03,589
What's that, Sherman?

711
00:35:03,756 --> 00:35:05,215
Tut? Give me a break.

712
00:35:05,383 --> 00:35:08,594
Bald, wears a skirt,
and makeup.

713
00:35:08,761 --> 00:35:11,305
If I didn't know
any better, Sherman,
I would say you were jealous.

714
00:35:11,473 --> 00:35:13,265
Jealous? Of what?

715
00:35:13,433 --> 00:35:15,225
Tut's affection
for Penny, of course.

716
00:35:15,393 --> 00:35:16,810
You think I like Penny?

717
00:35:17,061 --> 00:35:18,228
Mmm-hmm.

718
00:35:18,438 --> 00:35:19,563
Give me a break!

719
00:35:19,731 --> 00:35:24,401
It's not like I
want to hold her hand,
or go to the park...

720
00:35:24,569 --> 00:35:27,404
or watch her while
she's brushing her hair.

721
00:35:30,325 --> 00:35:31,742
Or anything.

722
00:35:32,118 --> 00:35:33,243
Hmm.

723
00:35:34,537 --> 00:35:35,996
A-ha!

724
00:35:38,625 --> 00:35:40,167
Quickly, Sherman.

725
00:35:43,463 --> 00:35:45,756
Ah, ah, ah!
Careful, Sherman.

726
00:35:46,007 --> 00:35:47,591
It's a booby trap.

727
00:35:47,717 --> 00:35:49,968
What's so funny?

728
00:35:50,053 --> 00:35:51,428
You said "booby."

729
00:35:53,515 --> 00:35:56,016
One wrong step
and we're done for.

730
00:35:57,769 --> 00:35:58,852
"The boat...

731
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:01,522
"of Ra sails straight...

732
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:02,940
"to day.

733
00:36:03,107 --> 00:36:06,652
"Take the wrong boat...

734
00:36:06,819 --> 00:36:08,111
man will pay."

735
00:36:08,279 --> 00:36:09,530
All right, Sherman,
now it's your turn.

736
00:36:09,822 --> 00:36:12,366
Do the puzzle
exactly as I did.

737
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:13,492
Huh?

738
00:36:13,576 --> 00:36:15,202
Think it through,
one step at a time.

739
00:36:19,707 --> 00:36:21,500
The boat of Ra
sails straight...

740
00:36:21,668 --> 00:36:22,668
 play.

741
00:36:23,628 --> 00:36:24,711
Uh, I mean, "pay."

742
00:36:24,879 --> 00:36:25,963
Oh, my.

743
00:36:29,467 --> 00:36:30,676
Uh-oh.

744
00:36:33,346 --> 00:36:34,388
 Run!

745
00:36:39,852 --> 00:36:41,395
The boats of Ra!

746
00:36:41,563 --> 00:36:43,480
One boat is the way out,
the other will send us...

747
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:45,232
plunging into darkness
and certain death.

748
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,733
What?

749
00:36:46,901 --> 00:36:47,901
Sherman, get in the boat.

750
00:36:48,069 --> 00:36:50,988
As soon as I move
these blocks together,
it's going to move very fast.

751
00:36:51,155 --> 00:36:52,239
Which boat, Mr. Peabody?

752
00:36:52,365 --> 00:36:53,407
What?

753
00:36:53,575 --> 00:36:56,159
Which boat
is the "not-certain-
death-plunge" boat?

754
00:36:56,327 --> 00:36:57,494
That one!

755
00:37:11,175 --> 00:37:12,342
We did it, Sherman!

756
00:37:12,427 --> 00:37:13,510
Sherman?

757
00:37:13,595 --> 00:37:15,262
Mr. Peabody!

758
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:16,722
What are you
doing over there?

759
00:37:16,889 --> 00:37:19,099
I thought you
pointed to this one!

760
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:30,360
Ahhh!

761
00:37:44,542 --> 00:37:46,585
Sherman? Sherman?

762
00:37:46,753 --> 00:37:48,211
Are you all right?

763
00:37:48,921 --> 00:37:50,547
 I'm good.

764
00:38:03,478 --> 00:38:05,228
The sun god, Ra...

765
00:38:05,396 --> 00:38:09,983
commands us to begin
the sacred ceremony!

766
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:23,747
Bring forth the blade
for the blood oath.

767
00:38:27,919 --> 00:38:32,673
Where blade meets flesh
in this sacred rite...

768
00:38:35,301 --> 00:38:36,593
We pay tribute...

769
00:38:36,761 --> 00:38:38,929
to the sun god, Ra!

770
00:38:39,681 --> 00:38:40,931
 Wait!

771
00:38:42,642 --> 00:38:43,684
 Anubis!

772
00:38:43,768 --> 00:38:44,935
The god of death!

773
00:38:45,103 --> 00:38:47,270
 The wedding
must not continue.

774
00:38:47,438 --> 00:38:49,314
Why, Anubis, why?

775
00:38:49,482 --> 00:38:51,983
Plagues. Plagues!

776
00:38:52,318 --> 00:38:54,486
If this marriage
pact is sealed...

777
00:38:54,654 --> 00:38:58,490
I will shower
down upon the land
uncountable plagues.

778
00:38:58,658 --> 00:39:00,158
Oy, again
with the plagues!

779
00:39:00,326 --> 00:39:02,327
Why did I ever
move to Egypt?

780
00:39:02,495 --> 00:39:05,622
But, Anubis,
the sun god, Ra,
has decreed...

781
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:08,458
that this girl
is to be
the boy-king's wife.

782
00:39:08,835 --> 00:39:10,293
That's so funny.

783
00:39:10,461 --> 00:39:13,672
I was talking to
the sun god, Ra,
just the other day...

784
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,466
and he told me
he changed his mind.

785
00:39:16,551 --> 00:39:17,551
Really?

786
00:39:17,635 --> 00:39:21,555
Old "Flip-Flop Ra,"
we call him here
in the underworld.

787
00:39:21,723 --> 00:39:24,891
But it's too late.
We've already paid
for the catering.

788
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:29,855
Too bad!
You're going to
lose your deposit.

789
00:39:32,358 --> 00:39:35,819
More smoke, Sherman.
This canine
subterfuge is working.

790
00:39:35,987 --> 00:39:37,154
Deliver the girl...

791
00:39:37,321 --> 00:39:40,198
to the gates of the city,
and leave her there...

792
00:39:40,366 --> 00:39:43,493
where the gods
will retrieve her forthwith.

793
00:39:43,661 --> 00:39:47,664
Only in this
manner may the plagues
upon this land be avoided.

794
00:39:47,832 --> 00:39:49,833
 The girl must go!

795
00:39:51,294 --> 00:39:52,335
Ow!

796
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:54,171
Anubis has spoken!

797
00:39:54,338 --> 00:39:56,548
Take this girl to the gates!

798
00:39:56,674 --> 00:39:57,841
Ow.

799
00:40:03,181 --> 00:40:05,724
Anubis, you sound unwell.

800
00:40:05,892 --> 00:40:08,393
Well, I have been feeling
a little under the weather...

801
00:40:08,561 --> 00:40:11,188
but I'm feeling
much better now.

802
00:40:11,898 --> 00:40:13,106
Thank you.

803
00:40:15,109 --> 00:40:16,777
Phew! Huh?

804
00:40:24,368 --> 00:40:26,161
Penny, Sherman, quickly.

805
00:40:26,245 --> 00:40:27,329
Come on, Penny.

806
00:40:27,413 --> 00:40:28,580
Sherman!

807
00:40:30,374 --> 00:40:31,833
Ah!

808
00:40:34,378 --> 00:40:35,754
Runaway bride!

809
00:40:35,922 --> 00:40:37,464
Stop them, you fools!

810
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:41,510
Ah!

811
00:40:57,443 --> 00:40:59,569
Penny, Sherman,
climb aboard.

812
00:41:00,738 --> 00:41:02,197
Whoo-hoo!

813
00:41:09,914 --> 00:41:11,915
They're getting away!

814
00:41:12,583 --> 00:41:13,583
Ah!

815
00:41:22,718 --> 00:41:24,386
Whoa!

816
00:41:27,598 --> 00:41:29,307
I got it.

817
00:41:31,561 --> 00:41:33,186
Whoo-hoo! We made it.

818
00:41:33,312 --> 00:41:35,146
 Where do we
go next, Mr. Peabody?
Home.

819
00:41:35,314 --> 00:41:36,940
We've got to get back
to the dinner party...

820
00:41:37,108 --> 00:41:38,984
before Penny's parents
realize she's missing.

821
00:41:39,151 --> 00:41:41,486
We don't have to
mention the whole...

822
00:41:41,654 --> 00:41:43,530
uh, King Tut
wedding thing, right?

823
00:41:43,614 --> 00:41:44,865
Certainly not.

824
00:41:44,949 --> 00:41:46,658
Anyway,
as far as I'm concerned,

825
00:41:46,784 --> 00:41:48,493
they get married too
young in Ancient Egypt.

826
00:41:48,661 --> 00:41:51,538
Or, perhaps,
I'm just some old "Giza."

827
00:41:53,416 --> 00:41:54,624
Huh?

828
00:41:55,793 --> 00:41:56,835
 Warning.

829
00:41:57,336 --> 00:41:59,462
WABAC power
supply insufficient.

830
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:02,048
Charge now. Warning.

831
00:42:02,216 --> 00:42:03,800
Uh, what's the matter,
Mr. Peabody?

832
00:42:03,968 --> 00:42:06,678
All this zipping about
the cosmos has drained
our power supply.

833
00:42:06,846 --> 00:42:08,972
We're going to have to
make an unscheduled stop.

834
00:42:09,265 --> 00:42:10,390
As luck would have it...

835
00:42:10,474 --> 00:42:12,559
we have just enough
power to make it
to the Renaissance.

836
00:42:25,656 --> 00:42:29,159
I can't even
tell my left brain
from my right anymore!

837
00:42:29,327 --> 00:42:31,328
How many times
I got to tell you,
Mona Lisa?

838
00:42:31,495 --> 00:42:32,454
Mona Lisa?

839
00:42:32,538 --> 00:42:34,664
 I can't
paint the picture...

840
00:42:34,832 --> 00:42:36,750
until you smile!

841
00:42:36,918 --> 00:42:40,503
Leonardo, tell me one thing
I have to smile about.

842
00:42:40,671 --> 00:42:42,422
The sunshine, the pasta.

843
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:46,426
All the things that make
Italy such a popular
tourist destination!

844
00:42:46,594 --> 00:42:49,387
But I have not
seen any of them,
Leonardo!

845
00:42:49,555 --> 00:42:52,849
Because I'm
sitting here all day
on my abbondanza!

846
00:42:53,684 --> 00:42:56,436
I don't think
that means
"chair" in Italian.

847
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:59,689
Ah, Peabody, my old friend.

848
00:42:59,857 --> 00:43:02,275
What a welcome
interruption!

849
00:43:02,443 --> 00:43:06,029
Believe you me,
this woman is
making me nuts.

850
00:43:06,197 --> 00:43:07,781
So, how you been?

851
00:43:07,949 --> 00:43:09,741
Good to see you.
What do you want?

852
00:43:09,909 --> 00:43:11,701
We're in a desperate
hurry to get home,

853
00:43:11,827 --> 00:43:13,578
but the WABAC
needs a jump start...

854
00:43:13,746 --> 00:43:16,039
and we thought,
who better than

855
00:43:16,165 --> 00:43:18,375
Leonardo da Vinci to
help us on our way?

856
00:43:18,542 --> 00:43:20,961
Peabody,
I would love to help you,

857
00:43:21,087 --> 00:43:23,463
but you come at
a very bad time.

858
00:43:23,631 --> 00:43:26,716
I don't know
what I'm going to do
with this crazy woman.

859
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:29,302
You see what I mean?

860
00:43:29,428 --> 00:43:30,470
What seems to be the problem?

861
00:43:30,638 --> 00:43:31,972
"What is the problem?"

862
00:43:32,139 --> 00:43:34,724
I am halfway done
with the painting,
she won't even smile.

863
00:43:34,892 --> 00:43:37,769
Fine. I smile.

864
00:43:40,231 --> 00:43:42,565
No! That's a fake smile!

865
00:43:42,733 --> 00:43:44,067
Everybody knows that!

866
00:43:44,235 --> 00:43:46,486
Why don't you
make it a real smile?

867
00:43:46,654 --> 00:43:48,113
Why don't you say
something funny?

868
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:49,739
I paint the paintings.

869
00:43:49,907 --> 00:43:51,741
I make the machines.

870
00:43:51,909 --> 00:43:54,661
I don't tell the jokes!

871
00:43:54,829 --> 00:43:57,414
Perhaps, I can be
of assistance. You see...

872
00:43:57,581 --> 00:43:59,624
humor is not immune
to the laws of science.

873
00:43:59,792 --> 00:44:01,584
Using algorithms,
we can extrapolate

874
00:44:01,711 --> 00:44:03,461
what is universally
considered "funny"...

875
00:44:03,629 --> 00:44:05,755
thus producing
a formula that is

876
00:44:05,881 --> 00:44:07,924
scientifically
certain to cause laughter.

877
00:44:08,342 --> 00:44:10,927
Case in point,
the pratfall.

878
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:18,977
Is everyone amused?

879
00:44:20,938 --> 00:44:22,188
Hmm.

880
00:44:22,273 --> 00:44:23,857
The data
was so clear. Ooh!

881
00:44:24,025 --> 00:44:25,316
Don't worry, Mr. Peabody.

882
00:44:25,484 --> 00:44:26,818
I got it!
Sherman... Ahh!

883
00:44:26,902 --> 00:44:29,070
Oh!

884
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:43,793
Hold that smile!

885
00:44:43,961 --> 00:44:45,962
Hold it right there!
No move! No move!

886
00:44:54,013 --> 00:44:56,723
 Well, Leo, if my
calculations are correct...

887
00:44:56,891 --> 00:44:59,517
this machine of
ours should generate
enough centrifugal force...

888
00:44:59,685 --> 00:45:00,894
to send us home.

889
00:45:01,062 --> 00:45:03,480
I got one last piece
I gotta pound in place.

890
00:45:03,647 --> 00:45:06,816
Sherman, why don't
you fetch the hammer
for Mr. Da Vinci?

891
00:45:06,984 --> 00:45:08,818
Okay, Mr. Peabody.

892
00:45:13,491 --> 00:45:14,616
Mr. Peabody!

893
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:15,825
Well done, Sherman.

894
00:45:15,993 --> 00:45:16,993
But, Mr. Peabody!

895
00:45:17,161 --> 00:45:18,495
Very helpful.

896
00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:34,177
Sherman!

897
00:45:34,678 --> 00:45:36,179
Yes, Mr. Peabody?

898
00:45:36,889 --> 00:45:38,098
The hammer.

899
00:45:38,599 --> 00:45:39,766
Da Vinci.

900
00:45:39,892 --> 00:45:42,310
Oh. Okay, Mr. Peabody.

901
00:45:43,687 --> 00:45:45,355
Oh!

902
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:47,607
Here you go, Mr. Da Vinci.
Ahh!

903
00:45:47,775 --> 00:45:48,858
Do you need any help?

904
00:45:49,026 --> 00:45:50,860
No, no.
That's quite all right.

905
00:45:51,028 --> 00:45:52,529
Thank you.

906
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,280
Psst! Sherman.

907
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:57,033
Huh?
Let's go. Let's go explore.

908
00:45:57,701 --> 00:45:59,744
Uh, well, I'm supposed
to be having

909
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:01,913
father-son time
with Mr. Peabody.

910
00:46:02,081 --> 00:46:03,748
Wouldn't you rather
have fun with me?

911
00:46:03,916 --> 00:46:05,083
Uh...

912
00:46:05,292 --> 00:46:06,334
Okay.

913
00:46:06,418 --> 00:46:07,460
Sherman...

914
00:46:07,628 --> 00:46:08,711
where are you going?

915
00:46:08,879 --> 00:46:09,963
Exploring.

916
00:46:10,131 --> 00:46:11,256
But we need your help.

917
00:46:11,423 --> 00:46:13,925
No, we don't!
I mean, we can manage.

918
00:46:14,093 --> 00:46:15,218
 Somehow.

919
00:46:15,803 --> 00:46:17,095
He's a boy, Peabody.

920
00:46:17,263 --> 00:46:19,889
Let him have his fun.
Let him go.

921
00:46:20,057 --> 00:46:21,724
Thanks, Mr. Peabody!

922
00:46:25,312 --> 00:46:27,438
He's growing up, Peabody.

923
00:46:27,606 --> 00:46:30,650
Like a baby bird
leaving the nest.

924
00:46:30,901 --> 00:46:33,236
Isn't it wonderful?

925
00:46:40,244 --> 00:46:42,412
It's like a museum.

926
00:46:43,247 --> 00:46:45,748
It's like a toy store.

927
00:46:50,588 --> 00:46:52,255
Wow.

928
00:46:56,093 --> 00:46:57,260
 Check this out.

929
00:46:57,428 --> 00:46:59,929
It's the world's
biggest model airplane.

930
00:47:00,097 --> 00:47:02,765
It's not a model, Penny.
It's a prototype.

931
00:47:02,933 --> 00:47:05,935
And we should probably
just leave that alone.

932
00:47:06,061 --> 00:47:07,020
Okay.

933
00:47:07,104 --> 00:47:09,189
But wouldn't it be cool
if we could fly it?

934
00:47:09,356 --> 00:47:11,357
I don't think
Mr. Peabody would like that.

935
00:47:11,525 --> 00:47:13,610
Well, Mr. Peabody
isn't here.

936
00:47:13,777 --> 00:47:15,320
Just tell me how it works.

937
00:47:15,487 --> 00:47:16,696
Please?

938
00:47:16,947 --> 00:47:18,156
For learning.

939
00:47:18,282 --> 00:47:19,991
Oh. Okay.

940
00:47:20,784 --> 00:47:23,953
The thrust comes from
this kind of crossbow
doohickey here.

941
00:47:24,121 --> 00:47:28,124
Then it shoots along
the track until the wind
catches the wings.

942
00:47:28,292 --> 00:47:30,043
But how does it go?
Huh?

943
00:47:30,211 --> 00:47:31,628
How do you take off?

944
00:47:31,795 --> 00:47:33,880
Oh, you just
pull down that lever.

945
00:47:35,132 --> 00:47:36,382
This one?

946
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:37,675
Oh, boy.

947
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,302
 Ah!

948
00:47:41,722 --> 00:47:44,766
Wow! Whoo-hoo!

949
00:47:46,352 --> 00:47:47,977
 This is crazy!

950
00:47:48,145 --> 00:47:50,396
No, it's not Sherman.
It's fun!

951
00:47:50,564 --> 00:47:51,856
We're gonna die!

952
00:47:52,024 --> 00:47:54,817
Oh, stop being
such a party pooper and
enjoy it! (LAUGHING)

953
00:48:00,157 --> 00:48:01,407
Ah...

954
00:48:01,492 --> 00:48:04,327
Nothing is as beautiful
as an elegant equation...

955
00:48:04,495 --> 00:48:07,163
translated into
perfect engineering.

956
00:48:07,331 --> 00:48:09,332
Why can't children
be so simple?

957
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:12,502
Because children
are not machines, Peabody.

958
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:15,880
Believe me,
I tried to build one.

959
00:48:16,048 --> 00:48:18,174
Oh! It was creepy.

960
00:48:20,594 --> 00:48:22,220
Here, Sherman!
You fly it!

961
00:48:22,388 --> 00:48:23,680
But I don't want to fly!

962
00:48:23,847 --> 00:48:25,682
Sure you do. It'll be fun!

963
00:48:25,849 --> 00:48:28,434
No, seriously, Penny,
I don't want to!

964
00:48:28,602 --> 00:48:30,353
I'm letting go. One...

965
00:48:30,521 --> 00:48:31,562
Don't let go!

966
00:48:31,689 --> 00:48:32,689
Two...

967
00:48:32,773 --> 00:48:34,274
No!
Three!

968
00:48:37,528 --> 00:48:38,695
Penny, fly the plane!

969
00:48:39,196 --> 00:48:40,321
No, Sherman!

970
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:41,531
You're going to
have to save us!

971
00:48:41,699 --> 00:48:42,740
But I can't do it!

972
00:48:43,284 --> 00:48:46,119
I'm serious, Penny.
I don't know how to fly!

973
00:48:46,287 --> 00:48:48,037
You can do it!
I know you can!

974
00:48:48,205 --> 00:48:49,247
Come on, Sherman.

975
00:48:49,415 --> 00:48:50,415
Fly!

976
00:48:57,214 --> 00:48:58,631
Ah!

977
00:49:03,554 --> 00:49:05,138
Phew!

978
00:49:16,567 --> 00:49:18,568
See? You got this,
Sherman.

979
00:49:18,736 --> 00:49:21,446
You're right.
I have got this.

980
00:49:22,031 --> 00:49:23,906
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

981
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:31,497
Da Vinci's at it again!

982
00:49:31,665 --> 00:49:33,249
You ever see
that child he made?

983
00:49:33,417 --> 00:49:34,751
So creepy.

984
00:49:34,918 --> 00:49:36,461
Papa. Mama.
(BOTH SHUDDERING)

985
00:49:37,671 --> 00:49:39,130
Papa. Mama.

986
00:50:06,116 --> 00:50:07,533
All done up here, Leonardo.

987
00:50:07,701 --> 00:50:09,869
And I am all done
down here.

988
00:50:10,037 --> 00:50:11,788
It is beautiful, isn't it?

989
00:50:11,955 --> 00:50:16,125
Every piece in its place
doing precisely what
it's supposed to do.

990
00:50:16,293 --> 00:50:17,710
Look, Peabody!

991
00:50:17,878 --> 00:50:19,796
It's my flying mach...

992
00:50:19,963 --> 00:50:21,297
My flying machine?

993
00:50:21,548 --> 00:50:22,548
Sherman.

994
00:50:22,633 --> 00:50:23,633
Sherman?

995
00:50:23,801 --> 00:50:26,052
Sherman, what are
you doing up there?

996
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:27,637
I'm flying!

997
00:50:27,805 --> 00:50:30,431
But, Sherman,
you don't know how to fly!

998
00:50:30,516 --> 00:50:31,557
I don't?

999
00:50:31,642 --> 00:50:32,642
No!

1000
00:50:39,149 --> 00:50:40,233
Turn!

1001
00:50:40,317 --> 00:50:41,317
Turn, Sherman!

1002
00:50:41,402 --> 00:50:43,528
Lean!

1003
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:48,825
Oh, no!

1004
00:50:57,668 --> 00:50:59,877
Sherman! Are you okay?

1005
00:51:00,045 --> 00:51:02,713
That was pretty fantastic!

1006
00:51:03,841 --> 00:51:06,050
Oh! I can't believe it!

1007
00:51:07,010 --> 00:51:09,262
My flying machine!
It's work!

1008
00:51:09,638 --> 00:51:13,808
 Sherman!
You are the first flying man!

1009
00:51:14,017 --> 00:51:15,893
Oh, you should be
very proud, Peabody.

1010
00:51:16,061 --> 00:51:17,728
Very, very proud!

1011
00:51:17,896 --> 00:51:20,022
"Proud" doesn't
begin to describe it.

1012
00:51:21,859 --> 00:51:24,360
Leonardo, will you please
fire up the mechanism?

1013
00:51:43,046 --> 00:51:46,632
Papa. Mama.

1014
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,593
Mona!

1015
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:51,220
Papa. Mama.

1016
00:51:51,305 --> 00:51:52,305
The kid!

1017
00:52:18,832 --> 00:52:21,417
I'm sorry I broke
the plane, Mr. Peabody.

1018
00:52:21,585 --> 00:52:24,128
Well, you should be.
You could have been killed.

1019
00:52:24,296 --> 00:52:25,630
What are you
talking about?

1020
00:52:25,797 --> 00:52:28,466
Sherman flew a plane.
He was amazing!

1021
00:52:28,634 --> 00:52:32,053
Sherman destroyed
a priceless
historical artifact.

1022
00:52:32,221 --> 00:52:34,388
Whatever. You
should be happy.

1023
00:52:34,556 --> 00:52:37,099
It turns out Sherman
is not a complete and
total loser, after all.

1024
00:52:37,267 --> 00:52:38,476
Yeah, Mr. Peabody.

1025
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:41,229
It turns out I'm not
a complete and
total loser, after all.

1026
00:52:42,981 --> 00:52:44,023
Ms. Peterson...

1027
00:52:44,107 --> 00:52:46,651
stop turning my son
into a hooligan.

1028
00:52:46,777 --> 00:52:48,069
It's not my fault
he's a hooligan.

1029
00:52:48,237 --> 00:52:50,738
Yeah, it's not her
fault I'm a hooligan.

1030
00:52:50,906 --> 00:52:52,281
Well, it's certainly
not my fault!

1031
00:52:52,449 --> 00:52:53,866
I've spent
the last seven years

1032
00:52:53,992 --> 00:52:55,409
teaching Sherman
good judgment.

1033
00:52:55,577 --> 00:52:56,619
If you're such
a great parent...

1034
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:59,288
why is Ms. Grunion
trying to take
Sherman away from you?

1035
00:53:02,334 --> 00:53:03,834
Is that true?

1036
00:53:04,002 --> 00:53:06,087
Is someone gonna
take me away from you?

1037
00:53:06,255 --> 00:53:08,589
No, Sherman,
I'll never let that happen.

1038
00:53:08,757 --> 00:53:10,341
You just need to trust me.

1039
00:53:10,509 --> 00:53:12,843
Oh, dear, a black hole!

1040
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:19,934
What's happening?

1041
00:53:20,102 --> 00:53:21,352
If I can't pull
us out of here...

1042
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:24,480
we're going to be
smashed to smithereens
on the event horizon.

1043
00:53:29,570 --> 00:53:32,280
There's not enough
power to resist
the gravitational pull!

1044
00:53:32,698 --> 00:53:35,283
I've got to divert everything
to the reverse thrusters.

1045
00:53:35,450 --> 00:53:36,450
Why didn't you tell me?

1046
00:53:36,618 --> 00:53:37,618
Tell you what?

1047
00:53:37,703 --> 00:53:39,161
Why didn't you
tell me Ms. Grunion

1048
00:53:39,329 --> 00:53:40,746
was trying to take
me away from you?

1049
00:53:41,081 --> 00:53:42,832
It's not your job to
worry about these things.

1050
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,542
You just didn't
think I could handle it.

1051
00:53:44,710 --> 00:53:46,794
We'll discuss it later.
Now, sit down.

1052
00:53:46,962 --> 00:53:48,838
I don't want to
discuss it later!

1053
00:53:49,006 --> 00:53:50,339
Sherman, sit!

1054
00:53:50,507 --> 00:53:52,425
You can't talk
to me like that.

1055
00:53:52,593 --> 00:53:53,843
I'm not a dog.

1056
00:53:54,011 --> 00:53:55,219
What did you say?

1057
00:53:55,387 --> 00:53:57,805
I said, I'm not a dog!

1058
00:53:58,265 --> 00:54:00,474
You're right,
Sherman, you're not.

1059
00:54:00,642 --> 00:54:02,935
You're just a very bad boy!

1060
00:54:03,353 --> 00:54:05,313
 T-minus 10...

1061
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:07,440
Nine, eight...

1062
00:54:07,524 --> 00:54:08,608
Seven...

1063
00:54:08,692 --> 00:54:09,650
Six...

1064
00:54:09,735 --> 00:54:10,943
Five...

1065
00:54:11,028 --> 00:54:12,820
Four, three...

1066
00:54:13,655 --> 00:54:14,363
Two...

1067
00:54:14,531 --> 00:54:15,448
One.

1068
00:54:30,088 --> 00:54:31,172
Sherman?

1069
00:54:31,673 --> 00:54:32,632
Penny?

1070
00:54:33,050 --> 00:54:34,800
Sherman, are you okay?

1071
00:54:38,138 --> 00:54:39,597
Sherman?

1072
00:54:47,022 --> 00:54:48,689
He's gone.

1073
00:54:48,857 --> 00:54:50,733
Where are we, anyway?

1074
00:54:52,069 --> 00:54:53,402
 Oh, no.

1075
00:54:54,154 --> 00:54:56,864
We're on the brink
of one of history's
most ferocious conflicts...

1076
00:55:12,631 --> 00:55:13,964
 Delivery.

1077
00:55:21,682 --> 00:55:24,058
How are we doing,
heroes of Greece?

1078
00:55:24,226 --> 00:55:25,476
Feeling good?

1079
00:55:25,644 --> 00:55:27,478
Feeling strong?

1080
00:55:28,647 --> 00:55:30,231
Okay, let's get warmed up!

1081
00:55:30,399 --> 00:55:32,066
We don't want to pull
something out there.

1082
00:55:32,234 --> 00:55:34,068
Remember what
happened to Achilles.

1083
00:55:34,236 --> 00:55:36,195
That whole thing
with his heel.

1084
00:55:38,115 --> 00:55:40,199
Looking good, Diomedes.

1085
00:55:40,492 --> 00:55:42,284
Menelaus, my man!

1086
00:55:42,494 --> 00:55:43,703
My man.

1087
00:55:43,870 --> 00:55:46,122
Are you ready
to get on the field,
Shermanus?

1088
00:55:49,876 --> 00:55:50,876
That's cute.

1089
00:55:52,421 --> 00:55:54,130
Shh.

1090
00:55:56,049 --> 00:55:59,051
Odysseus,
what news do you bring?

1091
00:55:59,594 --> 00:56:01,345
Someone left this for us.

1092
00:56:01,513 --> 00:56:02,763
A present. Nice.

1093
00:56:02,931 --> 00:56:05,182
It looks just like our horse.

1094
00:56:06,393 --> 00:56:08,060
Should I bring it inside?

1095
00:56:09,438 --> 00:56:10,771
It would be rude not to.

1096
00:56:16,153 --> 00:56:17,987
I did not see that coming!

1097
00:56:18,488 --> 00:56:21,824
Ugh! Jeez Louise,
what is that smell?

1098
00:56:22,033 --> 00:56:23,909
 Oh!

1099
00:56:23,994 --> 00:56:26,078
Ooh. That is
the smell of victory.

1100
00:56:26,163 --> 00:56:28,456
Yeah! Victory!

1101
00:56:28,623 --> 00:56:31,375
Greetings, men of
Athens, Sparta and Thebes.

1102
00:56:31,543 --> 00:56:32,793
Peabody, here.

1103
00:56:32,961 --> 00:56:34,545
I've come for Sherman.

1104
00:56:34,713 --> 00:56:36,547
Do you know this guy?
I thought I did...

1105
00:56:36,715 --> 00:56:38,174
but now I'm not so sure.

1106
00:56:38,341 --> 00:56:40,468
Then he must be a spy.
Kill him!

1107
00:56:40,635 --> 00:56:42,553
No! No!

1108
00:56:43,221 --> 00:56:45,514
He's my dad.

1109
00:56:45,682 --> 00:56:46,932
Your dad?
Huh?

1110
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:49,143
It's an adoptive
relationship.

1111
00:56:49,895 --> 00:56:51,312
Aw!

1112
00:56:51,438 --> 00:56:54,398
Thank you for
taking such good care
of my son, Agamemnon...

1113
00:56:54,566 --> 00:56:56,942
but it's time for
him to come home.

1114
00:56:57,110 --> 00:56:59,779
Sorry, Mr. Peabody,
I've joined the Greek army.

1115
00:56:59,946 --> 00:57:01,238
Shermanus is one of us now.

1116
00:57:01,406 --> 00:57:02,531
He's a brother.
I'm his brother.

1117
00:57:02,699 --> 00:57:03,699
He's my son.

1118
00:57:03,784 --> 00:57:05,034
He took an oath.
I took an oath.

1119
00:57:05,202 --> 00:57:05,910
He's seven!

1120
00:57:06,495 --> 00:57:07,995
And a half!

1121
00:57:08,330 --> 00:57:11,707
All sons must
prove themselves
to their fathers.

1122
00:57:11,875 --> 00:57:12,541
Today...

1123
00:57:12,834 --> 00:57:17,129
Shermanus will prove himself
on the field of battle.

1124
00:57:17,297 --> 00:57:18,130
But he's only a child.

1125
00:57:18,298 --> 00:57:21,342
Your dad may not think
you're ready to
become a man, Shermanus...

1126
00:57:21,510 --> 00:57:22,551
but we do.

1127
00:57:22,719 --> 00:57:23,636
 Yeah!

1128
00:57:23,762 --> 00:57:24,720
Yeah, Mr. Peabody.

1129
00:57:24,888 --> 00:57:26,680
Now, I'll show you
what I can handle.

1130
00:57:26,848 --> 00:57:29,183
FYI, a lot of heroes
have father issues.

1131
00:57:29,351 --> 00:57:30,768
My old man is a minotaur.

1132
00:57:30,936 --> 00:57:34,063
Half man,
half bull, all judgment.

1133
00:57:34,231 --> 00:57:36,357
Ajax, here, strongest
guy in the world...

1134
00:57:36,525 --> 00:57:40,069
but his father never
accepted that his real
dream was to sing.

1135
00:57:40,237 --> 00:57:41,987
I wanted to be
in the Greek chorus.

1136
00:57:42,155 --> 00:57:44,198
Uh, yeah, and
don't even get me
started about Oedipus.

1137
00:57:44,366 --> 00:57:46,200
Let's just say
that you do not want

1138
00:57:46,326 --> 00:57:48,160
to be at his house
over the holidays.

1139
00:57:48,328 --> 00:57:49,537
It's awkward.

1140
00:57:50,121 --> 00:57:51,831
Sherman, I'm concerned
you haven't
thought this through.

1141
00:57:51,998 --> 00:57:55,251
This is war.
Do you realize
what's about to happen?

1142
00:57:55,544 --> 00:57:57,002
I'll tell you
what's gonna happen.

1143
00:57:57,170 --> 00:57:59,380
We're gonna
destroy their houses!

1144
00:57:59,548 --> 00:58:00,881
Pull down their temples!

1145
00:58:01,049 --> 00:58:04,093
And make the streets
of the city run red...

1146
00:58:04,427 --> 00:58:06,262
with Trojan blood!

1147
00:58:06,429 --> 00:58:07,513
 Yeah!

1148
00:58:07,931 --> 00:58:12,142
 Blood!
Blood! Blood!

1149
00:58:21,278 --> 00:58:22,987
Zeus on three! One!

1150
00:58:23,154 --> 00:58:25,823
Sherman, I absolutely
forbid you to fight
in the Trojan War.

1151
00:58:25,991 --> 00:58:28,784
It's not fair! All my
friends are fighting
in the Trojan War.

1152
00:58:28,952 --> 00:58:30,536
Two!
Sherman, it's dangerous.

1153
00:58:30,704 --> 00:58:31,745
I'm wearing a helmet.

1154
00:58:31,913 --> 00:58:33,247
Three!
You're not going!

1155
00:58:33,415 --> 00:58:34,498
Oh, yes, I am.

1156
00:58:34,583 --> 00:58:36,292
Zeus!

1157
00:58:37,002 --> 00:58:39,044
 Zeus! Zeus!

1158
00:58:41,548 --> 00:58:44,800
Eat my bronze,
you Trojan dogs!

1159
00:58:46,845 --> 00:58:48,971
Eat my bronze,
you Trojan dog!

1160
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:52,474
Ahh!

1161
00:59:02,277 --> 00:59:03,861
Well, that's
cutting it close.

1162
00:59:06,072 --> 00:59:08,449
This is why I ask you
to obey me, Sherman.

1163
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:13,704
Because I'm your father,
and it's my job
to keep you safe.

1164
00:59:14,998 --> 00:59:17,958
But are you sure
Ms. Grunion won't
take me away?

1165
00:59:19,711 --> 00:59:21,587
Not as long
as I'm around.

1166
00:59:33,850 --> 00:59:34,934
 Mr. Peabody!

1167
00:59:35,101 --> 00:59:36,602
Help me!

1168
00:59:37,437 --> 00:59:38,437
Penny!

1169
00:59:45,987 --> 00:59:47,780
Smell my victory!

1170
00:59:47,948 --> 00:59:49,406
Smell it!

1171
00:59:49,574 --> 00:59:51,951
Hey! That's my ride!

1172
00:59:58,875 --> 00:59:59,792
Mr. Peabody...

1173
00:59:59,876 --> 01:00:01,126
hurry!

1174
01:00:04,047 --> 01:00:05,005
I'll take that.

1175
01:00:53,054 --> 01:00:54,722
You did it, Sherman!

1176
01:00:54,889 --> 01:00:55,973
Mr. Peabody helped.

1177
01:00:56,141 --> 01:00:57,683
Now, let's get to
the WABAC, go home,

1178
01:00:57,809 --> 01:00:59,393
un-hypnotize
Penny's parents...

1179
01:00:59,561 --> 01:01:00,769
finish that dinner party,
eat my Baked Alaska...

1180
01:01:00,937 --> 01:01:02,146
charm the pants
off Ms. Grunion...

1181
01:01:02,313 --> 01:01:04,648
and make sure none
of this ever happens
in the first place.

1182
01:01:04,816 --> 01:01:06,608
Sounds good.

1183
01:01:06,776 --> 01:01:07,776
I'm in.

1184
01:01:08,111 --> 01:01:09,278
Ah!

1185
01:01:11,781 --> 01:01:12,573
Sherman!

1186
01:01:13,241 --> 01:01:14,950
 Penny!
Sherman, no!

1187
01:01:25,378 --> 01:01:26,795
Whoa!

1188
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:35,262
 Mr. Peabody...

1189
01:01:36,097 --> 01:01:37,973
Mr. Peabody?

1190
01:01:39,059 --> 01:01:44,354
Mr. Peabody!

1191
01:01:46,066 --> 01:01:47,357
Dad!

1192
01:01:57,786 --> 01:02:01,747
Oh, Mr. Peabody!
What should I do?
What should I do?

1193
01:02:05,085 --> 01:02:07,461
There's nothing
you can do, Sherman.

1194
01:02:10,548 --> 01:02:12,549
I just want to go home.

1195
01:02:14,761 --> 01:02:15,886
Home. 

1196
01:02:17,138 --> 01:02:18,514
That's it.

1197
01:02:19,015 --> 01:02:20,766
I got an idea.

1198
01:02:21,059 --> 01:02:22,601
Come on!

1199
01:02:24,354 --> 01:02:25,479
Where are we gonna go?

1200
01:02:25,647 --> 01:02:26,814
We're going home.

1201
01:02:26,981 --> 01:02:28,899
There's only one person
who can help us...

1202
01:02:29,067 --> 01:02:30,609
and that's Mr. Peabody.

1203
01:02:30,777 --> 01:02:33,362
What are you talking about?
How is that even possible?

1204
01:02:33,530 --> 01:02:34,780
We've got a time machine,
Penny!

1205
01:02:34,948 --> 01:02:36,740
I can set it so
that we'll get home

1206
01:02:36,866 --> 01:02:38,700
when Mr. Peabody
is still there.

1207
01:02:39,077 --> 01:02:40,327
But I thought
you're not supposed

1208
01:02:40,453 --> 01:02:41,662
to go back to a time
when you existed.

1209
01:02:41,830 --> 01:02:43,330
What choice do we have?

1210
01:02:43,998 --> 01:02:48,460
 Error.
You are attempting to travel
to an era in which you exist.

1211
01:02:48,628 --> 01:02:50,212
This could alter
the fabric of space-time.

1212
01:02:51,881 --> 01:02:54,758
Error. Error.

1213
01:02:55,135 --> 01:02:56,635
Hang on!

1214
01:03:04,477 --> 01:03:05,978
This is fun!

1215
01:03:08,857 --> 01:03:12,151
This is a little
homespun concoction
I like to call...

1216
01:03:12,902 --> 01:03:14,736
"Einstein on the Beach."

1217
01:03:14,904 --> 01:03:16,238
 Yummy.

1218
01:03:18,533 --> 01:03:19,658
To the kids.

1219
01:03:19,826 --> 01:03:21,618
 To the kids!

1220
01:03:22,537 --> 01:03:24,037
 Mr. Peabody.

1221
01:03:24,205 --> 01:03:25,622
Sherman? Penny?

1222
01:03:25,790 --> 01:03:27,124
Can we talk to
you a second?

1223
01:03:27,292 --> 01:03:28,083
Of course.

1224
01:03:28,251 --> 01:03:29,543
Excuse me.

1225
01:03:32,213 --> 01:03:34,131
I've really hit it off
with your parents.

1226
01:03:34,299 --> 01:03:37,467
I think we can file
this night under
"Unqualified Success."

1227
01:03:37,635 --> 01:03:40,053
 I'd hold off
filing it just yet.

1228
01:03:40,221 --> 01:03:41,013
What do you mean?

1229
01:03:41,181 --> 01:03:43,515
Why are you two dressed
like ancient Greeks?

1230
01:03:43,683 --> 01:03:45,184
You used the WABAC!
I did.

1231
01:03:45,351 --> 01:03:46,977
I know, it's terrible!

1232
01:03:47,145 --> 01:03:48,020
But why?

1233
01:03:48,188 --> 01:03:50,230
Penny and I got
into an argument
about George Washington.

1234
01:03:50,398 --> 01:03:51,648
So, I made him
show me the WABAC.

1235
01:03:51,816 --> 01:03:52,983
And I lost her
in ancient Egypt.

1236
01:03:53,109 --> 01:03:54,318
And I got engaged
to King Tut.

1237
01:03:54,485 --> 01:03:56,153
So, I came back
and got you.
Then we ran out of gas.

1238
01:03:56,321 --> 01:03:57,946
In Florence.
Went into a black hole.

1239
01:03:58,114 --> 01:03:59,698
And then you died
in ancient Troy.

1240
01:03:59,866 --> 01:04:02,117
Died? I have a hard
time believing that.

1241
01:04:02,285 --> 01:04:03,118
 It's true!

1242
01:04:03,286 --> 01:04:05,746
But now you're here,
and everything's
gonna be okay.

1243
01:04:05,914 --> 01:04:07,915
I told you never to come back
to a time when you existed...

1244
01:04:08,082 --> 01:04:09,458
because there
would be two of you!

1245
01:04:09,626 --> 01:04:12,085
Yeah, but the other one
of me is in ancient Egypt.

1246
01:04:14,839 --> 01:04:16,965
 Ahh!

1247
01:04:17,091 --> 01:04:18,091
Who are you?

1248
01:04:18,259 --> 01:04:19,927
He's you, but
from another timeline.

1249
01:04:20,094 --> 01:04:23,180
But I thought you said
never to come back to
a time when you existed.

1250
01:04:23,348 --> 01:04:25,015
Exactly!
I know.

1251
01:04:25,767 --> 01:04:29,269
But what was I supposed
to do? Mr. Peabody
died in ancient Troy.

1252
01:04:29,437 --> 01:04:30,187
Died?

1253
01:04:30,355 --> 01:04:31,897
I have a hard time
believing that.

1254
01:04:32,065 --> 01:04:33,023
Thank you.

1255
01:04:33,191 --> 01:04:34,483
What are we going to do?

1256
01:04:34,776 --> 01:04:36,944
Well, for starters,
both Shermans
can't stay here.

1257
01:04:37,111 --> 01:04:38,445
Why? We could
get bunk beds.

1258
01:04:38,613 --> 01:04:39,696
I was thinking
the same thing.

1259
01:04:39,822 --> 01:04:41,448
That's so weird.
It's like we're twins!

1260
01:04:41,532 --> 01:04:42,532
I was thinking that, too!

1261
01:04:42,951 --> 01:04:44,034
 Ow!

1262
01:04:44,118 --> 01:04:46,995
You see? We can't
have two Shermans in
the same timeline.

1263
01:04:47,163 --> 01:04:50,582
It puts too much strain
on the space-time continuum.

1264
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:52,584
What to do?
The Petersons

1265
01:04:52,669 --> 01:04:54,044
can't know any of this.

1266
01:04:54,212 --> 01:04:55,629
 Hey, Pea-buddy.

1267
01:04:56,339 --> 01:04:57,297
Hey.

1268
01:04:57,465 --> 01:04:58,465
How's it going?

1269
01:04:58,633 --> 01:05:01,218
Patty and I are
working up an appetite.

1270
01:05:01,761 --> 01:05:03,804
Mmm. The smells
coming from your
kitchen are yummy!

1271
01:05:03,972 --> 01:05:06,098
Especially that
Baked Alaska.

1272
01:05:06,683 --> 01:05:08,058
So, what's going on here?

1273
01:05:08,226 --> 01:05:09,559
Yeah, what's
with the getups?

1274
01:05:10,019 --> 01:05:11,436
Toga party!

1275
01:05:11,604 --> 01:05:13,146
 Toga party?

1276
01:05:13,439 --> 01:05:16,817
Yes, it is a toga party!

1277
01:05:16,985 --> 01:05:18,235
 Well, what about dinner?

1278
01:05:18,403 --> 01:05:19,361
I'm starving.

1279
01:05:19,529 --> 01:05:20,696
Why don't we head
into the dining room...

1280
01:05:20,863 --> 01:05:22,781
and tuck into those quails
you've been yakking about?

1281
01:05:22,949 --> 01:05:23,865
No!
Why not?

1282
01:05:24,033 --> 01:05:27,828
Because it's so
fun right here!

1283
01:05:28,162 --> 01:05:30,789
Whoo-hoo! 

1284
01:05:37,922 --> 01:05:38,755
Ms. Grunion!

1285
01:05:38,923 --> 01:05:40,716
How delightful.

1286
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:42,467
We were having
such a good time...

1287
01:05:42,635 --> 01:05:43,885
I almost forgot
you were coming.
Oh!

1288
01:05:44,053 --> 01:05:45,679
Well, why don't
you join the party?

1289
01:05:45,847 --> 01:05:49,433
I'm not here for a party.
I'm here for
the investigation.

1290
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:52,853
Good. Why don't
you start investigating
over here?

1291
01:05:53,021 --> 01:05:55,981
Or here, or here,
or here...

1292
01:05:56,149 --> 01:05:57,733
Stop waving your hands around!

1293
01:06:00,695 --> 01:06:01,486
 Sherman?

1294
01:06:01,654 --> 01:06:03,322
Wait! Is that...?

1295
01:06:03,573 --> 01:06:05,115
 Sherman!

1296
01:06:05,283 --> 01:06:08,452
Dos Shermanos? What's
going on here, Peabody?

1297
01:06:08,578 --> 01:06:10,954
Oh...

1298
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:12,205
Um...

1299
01:06:12,290 --> 01:06:13,457
Nobody move!

1300
01:06:13,624 --> 01:06:16,960
Sherman, I've got to
get you out of here
before you touch yourself.

1301
01:06:18,963 --> 01:06:21,006
Mr. Peabody!
You didn't die!

1302
01:06:21,174 --> 01:06:22,632
Of course I didn't die.

1303
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:23,884
Thank you.

1304
01:06:24,093 --> 01:06:25,969
Hey. How did you get back?

1305
01:06:26,137 --> 01:06:27,763
Well, after a few
failed experiments...

1306
01:06:27,930 --> 01:06:30,140
I hit upon a combination
of bones, stone
and yak fat...

1307
01:06:30,308 --> 01:06:32,309
and constructed
a rudimentary WABAC.

1308
01:06:32,477 --> 01:06:33,435
You know what they say...

1309
01:06:33,603 --> 01:06:36,813
"If at first
you don't succeed,
Troy, Troy again."

1310
01:06:36,981 --> 01:06:39,649
This is no time for puns!
Even good ones.

1311
01:06:39,817 --> 01:06:41,276
Penny, Sherman,
quickly!

1312
01:06:41,527 --> 01:06:43,320
You're not going anywhere.

1313
01:06:43,488 --> 01:06:45,739
I've seen quite enough
to remove the boy...

1314
01:06:45,907 --> 01:06:48,325
 both boys,
from this home.

1315
01:06:48,493 --> 01:06:51,370
No, don't,
Ms. Grunion, please!

1316
01:06:51,537 --> 01:06:54,664
This is all my fault.
I started it.

1317
01:06:55,792 --> 01:06:57,376
I'm so sorry, Sherman.

1318
01:06:58,503 --> 01:07:01,254
You have nothing
to apologize for, Penny.

1319
01:07:01,422 --> 01:07:03,090
A dog should never
have been allowed

1320
01:07:03,216 --> 01:07:04,883
to adopt a boy
in the first place.

1321
01:07:05,051 --> 01:07:06,176
Now, come along.

1322
01:07:06,344 --> 01:07:07,803
Ms. Grunion,
be careful!

1323
01:07:08,262 --> 01:07:10,097
Ah! Oh!

1324
01:07:10,181 --> 01:07:11,014
What's happening?

1325
01:07:16,104 --> 01:07:18,188
 Mr. Peabody, help!

1326
01:07:18,356 --> 01:07:19,523
Sherman!
Sherman!

1327
01:07:23,653 --> 01:07:25,153
 Oh!

1328
01:07:33,246 --> 01:07:35,163
Hey! Where did
the other two go?

1329
01:07:35,581 --> 01:07:39,918
 Our cosmic doubles
combined in order to
reconcile a paradox...

1330
01:07:40,128 --> 01:07:42,712
in the space-time continuum.

1331
01:07:43,131 --> 01:07:44,631
Okay, that makes sense.

1332
01:07:45,091 --> 01:07:47,050
I don't know what
just happened here...

1333
01:07:47,218 --> 01:07:49,928
but I know it was wrong!

1334
01:07:50,096 --> 01:07:51,805
This boy is coming with me!
Mr. Peabody!

1335
01:07:52,223 --> 01:07:53,432
No, Ms. Grunion!
Ow! Let me go!

1336
01:07:53,641 --> 01:07:54,349
Get back here!

1337
01:07:55,059 --> 01:07:57,060
Ow! Ow! You're hurting me!

1338
01:08:00,064 --> 01:08:01,481
Oh! Oh!

1339
01:08:05,111 --> 01:08:07,195
He bit me!

1340
01:08:08,573 --> 01:08:10,449
He bit me!

1341
01:08:12,034 --> 01:08:13,577
Yes, hello, police.

1342
01:08:13,744 --> 01:08:15,662
I'd like to
report an assault.

1343
01:08:15,830 --> 01:08:16,830
A bite.

1344
01:08:16,998 --> 01:08:19,082
Mr. Peabody,
what are we gonna do?

1345
01:08:19,250 --> 01:08:20,667
 Get here
as soon as possible.

1346
01:08:20,835 --> 01:08:21,626
Run!

1347
01:08:22,795 --> 01:08:24,421
He's kidnapping
the children! Oh!

1348
01:08:27,592 --> 01:08:29,217
 I can't believe
you bit her, Mr. Peabody!

1349
01:08:29,385 --> 01:08:31,136
I know, Sherman,
it was wrong.

1350
01:08:31,304 --> 01:08:32,012
"Wrong"?

1351
01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:33,847
It was awesome!

1352
01:08:34,515 --> 01:08:37,434
And now, to return
to our proper timeline
and erase this mess.

1353
01:08:41,355 --> 01:08:44,858
There he is!
He's got my daughter
in that giant space apple!

1354
01:08:52,074 --> 01:08:53,909
 My face is numb.

1355
01:08:56,078 --> 01:08:57,537
Whoo-hoo!
Yes!

1356
01:08:58,831 --> 01:08:59,998
What's wrong?

1357
01:09:04,545 --> 01:09:05,921
time travel failed.

1358
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:07,172
Oh, dear.

1359
01:09:07,590 --> 01:09:09,716
 What is it,
Mr. Peabody?

1360
01:09:09,884 --> 01:09:10,842
Our cosmic
doubles colliding...

1361
01:09:11,010 --> 01:09:12,636
ripped a hole
in the space-time continuum.

1362
01:09:13,054 --> 01:09:15,096
That's why we didn't
get to the past.

1363
01:09:18,309 --> 01:09:20,310
Hey, Peabody!

1364
01:09:20,478 --> 01:09:22,437
Looks like the past
is coming to us.

1365
01:09:24,357 --> 01:09:26,525
Oof! I will get you, dog!

1366
01:09:26,984 --> 01:09:28,610
And your little boy, too!

1367
01:09:31,572 --> 01:09:32,280
Penny!

1368
01:09:32,448 --> 01:09:33,448
My bride!

1369
01:09:37,286 --> 01:09:38,203
What?

1370
01:09:40,790 --> 01:09:43,250
Oh, dear.

1371
01:09:51,509 --> 01:09:53,260
 Follow that orb!

1372
01:10:06,607 --> 01:10:07,983
Incoming!

1373
01:10:11,612 --> 01:10:13,488
What sort of
creature are you?

1374
01:10:13,656 --> 01:10:16,491
The name is Grunion!

1375
01:10:18,953 --> 01:10:20,412
I'm in love!

1376
01:10:23,457 --> 01:10:25,375
I just need to
find a wormhole.

1377
01:10:32,258 --> 01:10:34,509
Hey, Einstein,
it's a red light.

1378
01:10:34,677 --> 01:10:36,553
Hey, I'm walking, here!

1379
01:10:37,513 --> 01:10:39,180
Cake!

1380
01:10:39,265 --> 01:10:40,807
 Mmm!

1381
01:10:44,103 --> 01:10:46,271
There they go.
Don't lose them.

1382
01:10:51,861 --> 01:10:53,903
I'm trying to find
another wormhole...

1383
01:10:54,071 --> 01:10:54,946
but they all lead
back to the present!

1384
01:10:55,114 --> 01:10:56,364
 Time travel failed.

1385
01:10:57,408 --> 01:10:58,533
Time travel failed.

1386
01:11:03,956 --> 01:11:05,415
Whoo!

1387
01:11:05,583 --> 01:11:07,667
There he is. After them!

1388
01:11:07,835 --> 01:11:10,503
Penny, my queen,
I know you're in there.

1389
01:11:11,505 --> 01:11:13,548
We're coming, Shermanus!

1390
01:11:17,595 --> 01:11:18,595
 Time travel failed.

1391
01:11:18,721 --> 01:11:19,679
Mr. Peabody!

1392
01:11:19,764 --> 01:11:20,889
Look out!

1393
01:11:22,975 --> 01:11:24,392
ALL: Whoa!

1394
01:11:30,232 --> 01:11:31,608
Shermanus, hold on.

1395
01:11:31,776 --> 01:11:33,735
We shall release
you from this egg.

1396
01:11:36,906 --> 01:11:39,616
Drop the saber
and step away from
the futuristic orb.

1397
01:11:39,784 --> 01:11:41,951
I take orders from no man!

1398
01:11:48,459 --> 01:11:51,753
Don't tase me, bro.

1399
01:11:52,505 --> 01:11:54,297
Come out, Peabody,
with your paws in the air.

1400
01:11:56,842 --> 01:11:58,677
Mr. Peabody,
you're under arrest...

1401
01:11:58,844 --> 01:12:00,970
for kidnapping,
reckless endangerment...

1402
01:12:01,138 --> 01:12:04,432
And a multiplicity
of major traffic violations.

1403
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:05,475
You don't understand.

1404
01:12:05,643 --> 01:12:07,936
There's a rip
in the space-time continuum!

1405
01:12:08,104 --> 01:12:10,063
If you arrest me,
I won't be able to fix...

1406
01:12:10,231 --> 01:12:12,232
Blah, blah, blah.
For too long...

1407
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:15,276
you've bamboozled the world
with your fancy jargon...

1408
01:12:15,444 --> 01:12:16,611
and that little
red tie of yours...

1409
01:12:16,779 --> 01:12:18,113
and look what's come of it.

1410
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:19,197
Take him away!

1411
01:12:19,365 --> 01:12:20,073
Wait.

1412
01:12:21,534 --> 01:12:22,409
Mr. Peabody!

1413
01:12:22,576 --> 01:12:23,576
Sherman!

1414
01:12:25,371 --> 01:12:27,497
What's gonna happen
to Mr. Peabody?

1415
01:12:27,665 --> 01:12:30,625
Don't you know
what happens to
dogs that bite?

1416
01:12:30,793 --> 01:12:32,293
 Let me go.

1417
01:12:32,461 --> 01:12:33,712
You don't know
what you're doing.

1418
01:12:33,879 --> 01:12:35,880
Please, before
it's too late.

1419
01:12:36,006 --> 01:12:37,465
 Wait!

1420
01:12:38,008 --> 01:12:39,467
Give him another chance.

1421
01:12:39,635 --> 01:12:43,388
He's through with chances.
Now, he has to pay
for his mistakes.

1422
01:12:43,681 --> 01:12:45,348
But I'm the one
who made all
the mistakes.

1423
01:12:45,516 --> 01:12:48,268
I'm the one
who used the WABAC
without permission.

1424
01:12:48,436 --> 01:12:51,312
The only mistake
Mr. Peabody ever made...

1425
01:12:52,356 --> 01:12:53,648
was me.

1426
01:12:54,859 --> 01:12:56,234
Sherman.

1427
01:12:56,777 --> 01:12:58,987
You're absolutely
right, Sherman.

1428
01:12:59,155 --> 01:13:03,283
What kind of a father
could this dog
ever be to a boy?

1429
01:13:06,245 --> 01:13:07,871
Maybe you're right,
Ms. Grunion.

1430
01:13:08,038 --> 01:13:10,248
But there's one thing
you haven't considered.

1431
01:13:10,416 --> 01:13:11,499
What's that?

1432
01:13:13,043 --> 01:13:15,044
I'm a dog, too!

1433
01:13:17,047 --> 01:13:19,674
If being a dog
means you're like
Mr. Peabody...

1434
01:13:19,842 --> 01:13:21,634
who never turns
his back on you...

1435
01:13:21,802 --> 01:13:24,679
and who's always there
to pick you up
when you fall...

1436
01:13:24,847 --> 01:13:28,975
and loves you no matter
how many times you mess up...

1437
01:13:29,143 --> 01:13:31,436
if that's what it
means to be a dog...

1438
01:13:31,604 --> 01:13:34,814
then, yeah,
I'm a dog, too!

1439
01:13:36,734 --> 01:13:41,613
I'm a dog, too.

1440
01:13:41,781 --> 01:13:44,574
I'm a dog, too!

1441
01:13:44,742 --> 01:13:45,992
I'm a dog as well!

1442
01:13:46,368 --> 01:13:47,619
A poodle dog!

1443
01:13:47,787 --> 01:13:49,704
I am a dog, too.

1444
01:13:49,872 --> 01:13:51,372
Ditto on that dog thing!

1445
01:13:51,540 --> 01:13:56,044
I'm a dog, too.

1446
01:13:56,712 --> 01:13:57,712
I am a dog as well.

1447
01:13:57,880 --> 01:13:59,005
I'm a dog, too.

1448
01:13:59,131 --> 01:14:00,256
 I'm a dog, too.

1449
01:14:09,475 --> 01:14:11,226
I'm a dog, too.

1450
01:14:18,359 --> 01:14:20,485
I'm Spartacus!

1451
01:14:20,945 --> 01:14:24,864
All right, fine,
you're all dogs, but
you can't change the law.

1452
01:14:25,032 --> 01:14:26,908
I know someone who can.

1453
01:14:28,828 --> 01:14:30,286
George Washington.

1454
01:14:31,872 --> 01:14:35,166
We hold these truths
to be self-evident...

1455
01:14:35,334 --> 01:14:40,964
that all men, and some dogs,
are created equal.

1456
01:14:41,298 --> 01:14:46,052
I hereby award Mr. Peabody
a presidential pardon.

1457
01:14:46,220 --> 01:14:47,303
Me, too.

1458
01:14:47,471 --> 01:14:48,763
I've done worse.

1459
01:14:57,106 --> 01:14:58,773
Huh?

1460
01:15:03,153 --> 01:15:04,487
Uh, Mr. Peabody, look!

1461
01:15:10,119 --> 01:15:11,536
Ahh!

1462
01:15:12,621 --> 01:15:14,205
Ooh!

1463
01:15:17,543 --> 01:15:18,960
It's getting closer!

1464
01:15:19,128 --> 01:15:20,420
What are
we going to do?

1465
01:15:20,796 --> 01:15:22,964
This is the greatest
collection of geniuses
ever assembled!

1466
01:15:23,132 --> 01:15:26,009
Surely we can come
up with another way
of getting to the past.

1467
01:15:26,468 --> 01:15:27,802
I can build a catapult.

1468
01:15:27,970 --> 01:15:29,429
We go very fast.

1469
01:15:29,597 --> 01:15:32,682
But, remember,
as you approach
the speed of light...

1470
01:15:32,850 --> 01:15:34,976
gravity will get too strong.

1471
01:15:35,144 --> 01:15:38,479
Oh, indeed. "For every
action, there is an equal
and opposite reaction."

1472
01:15:38,647 --> 01:15:42,275
How about we just punch
that big hole in the face?

1473
01:15:51,327 --> 01:15:52,952
I have an idea.

1474
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:56,080
Hey, everybody,
I have an idea!

1475
01:15:56,248 --> 01:15:57,373
Yes, what
is it, Sherman?

1476
01:15:58,584 --> 01:16:00,460
Why not go to the future?

1477
01:16:00,878 --> 01:16:01,961
The future?

1478
01:16:02,129 --> 01:16:06,507
I've never been there
before, so it's probably
not as messed up.

1479
01:16:07,593 --> 01:16:08,843
Sherman, that's it!

1480
01:16:08,928 --> 01:16:10,678
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

1481
01:16:10,846 --> 01:16:12,055
Not usually.

1482
01:16:12,222 --> 01:16:14,515
It's exactly what
you all just said...

1483
01:16:14,934 --> 01:16:16,935
except the total opposite!

1484
01:16:18,270 --> 01:16:21,064
If we set
the WABAC for the future,
and go very, very fast...

1485
01:16:21,231 --> 01:16:23,441
we'll create our own
gravitational field...

1486
01:16:23,609 --> 01:16:25,401
that's equal and opposite...

1487
01:16:25,569 --> 01:16:28,863
to the rip in
the space-time continuum!

1488
01:16:30,115 --> 01:16:31,783
 Oh, my...

1489
01:16:31,951 --> 01:16:33,326
I don't get it.

1490
01:16:33,494 --> 01:16:37,080
We're gonna fly up there
and punch that big
hole in the face!

1491
01:16:37,498 --> 01:16:38,289
Yes!

1492
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,169
Sherman, you're a genius.

1493
01:16:44,713 --> 01:16:45,797
But, Peabody...

1494
01:16:45,881 --> 01:16:48,591
how far into
the future must you go?

1495
01:16:48,759 --> 01:16:50,551
Just a few seconds
ought to do it,

1496
01:16:50,678 --> 01:16:52,428
and then we'll
slingshot right back.

1497
01:16:52,596 --> 01:16:54,472
Are you sure this
is going to work?

1498
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:56,099
Don't worry, Penny.

1499
01:16:56,642 --> 01:16:58,351
Just remember,
I'm a... 

1500
01:16:59,770 --> 01:17:01,145
Genius!

1501
01:17:01,730 --> 01:17:02,438
Sherman...

1502
01:17:02,523 --> 01:17:04,357
I need to reprogram
the WABAC.

1503
01:17:04,525 --> 01:17:05,608
All right, Mr. Peabody.

1504
01:17:05,776 --> 01:17:07,819
That means you have to drive.

1505
01:17:36,932 --> 01:17:38,599
In order to make the leap
into the future...

1506
01:17:38,767 --> 01:17:40,560
the WABAC will
have to go very fast.

1507
01:17:40,728 --> 01:17:42,520
Faster than it's
ever gone before!

1508
01:17:43,689 --> 01:17:45,606
Are you ready, Sherman?

1509
01:17:46,108 --> 01:17:47,025
I'm ready.

1510
01:17:51,363 --> 01:17:53,364
Come on, Sherman,
you can do it.

1511
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:05,793
Now, Mr. Peabody?

1512
01:18:05,961 --> 01:18:07,712
Sherman, we need more speed.

1513
01:18:11,008 --> 01:18:12,175
Now?

1514
01:18:12,342 --> 01:18:13,968
Just a little more!

1515
01:18:14,219 --> 01:18:15,636
(SHUDDERS)

1516
01:18:16,305 --> 01:18:17,930
Not yet, Sherman.

1517
01:18:18,098 --> 01:18:18,973
Not yet.

1518
01:18:20,184 --> 01:18:20,975
Now!

1519
01:18:56,678 --> 01:18:58,054
Whoa! Whoa!

1520
01:18:58,472 --> 01:18:59,806
Farewell!

1521
01:19:08,273 --> 01:19:09,440
Ooh!

1522
01:19:09,525 --> 01:19:11,776
You haven't seen
the last of me,
Peabody.

1523
01:19:11,944 --> 01:19:15,154
You'll make
a mistake eventually,
and when you do...

1524
01:19:15,322 --> 01:19:17,490
I'll be there!

1525
01:19:17,658 --> 01:19:19,283
The Grunion is mine!
Ooh!

1526
01:19:40,013 --> 01:19:43,141
Come on, Sherman. Come on!

1527
01:20:05,622 --> 01:20:07,748
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

1528
01:20:32,816 --> 01:20:34,609
 If you want
to watch television
before I get home...

1529
01:20:34,776 --> 01:20:36,777
simply press
"input" three times...

1530
01:20:36,945 --> 01:20:38,154
and then use
the remote control
as usual.

1531
01:20:38,322 --> 01:20:39,322
Yes, Sherman.

1532
01:20:39,489 --> 01:20:41,824
And if you're worried
about making friends
at the PTA meeting...

1533
01:20:41,992 --> 01:20:43,576
consider bringing
snacks for everyone.

1534
01:20:43,744 --> 01:20:45,411
Bagels are always
appreciated.

1535
01:20:45,579 --> 01:20:46,913
Yes, Sherman.

1536
01:20:48,123 --> 01:20:49,624
And remember,
Mr. Peabody...

1537
01:20:49,791 --> 01:20:52,710
I have robotics club
after school today.

1538
01:20:53,420 --> 01:20:55,254
Sherman, wait.

1539
01:20:55,422 --> 01:20:57,173
Yes, Mr. Peabody?

1540
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:00,218
I...

1541
01:21:01,595 --> 01:21:03,846
I love you, Sherman.

1542
01:21:07,392 --> 01:21:10,811
I have a deep regard
for you as well,
Mr. Peabody.

1543
01:21:22,366 --> 01:21:23,574
Hey, Mr. Peabody!

1544
01:21:23,742 --> 01:21:24,825
Hey, Sherman!

1545
01:21:24,993 --> 01:21:26,202
Wait up!

1546
01:21:29,122 --> 01:21:30,539
No doubt about it.

1547
01:21:30,707 --> 01:21:33,209
Every dog should have a boy.

1548
01:21:54,773 --> 01:21:56,232
Oh!

1549
01:21:59,194 --> 01:22:01,529
 Ooh!

1550
01:22:01,613 --> 01:22:03,364
 Ah!

1551
01:22:05,784 --> 01:22:07,243
A-ha!

1552
01:22:21,008 --> 01:22:24,593
I now pronounce
you husband and wife.

1553
01:22:24,761 --> 01:22:26,971
You may kiss the Grunion.

1554
01:22:28,557 --> 01:22:30,516
Come here, soldier.

1555
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:48,034
There's always time for living

1556
01:22:48,910 --> 01:22:51,412
Can we just do it again?

1557
01:22:52,581 --> 01:22:58,419
One more time
like it once was
way back when

1558
01:23:00,005 --> 01:23:02,673
You gave me
something to believe in

1559
01:23:03,675 --> 01:23:06,302
We were the best of friends

1560
01:23:07,596 --> 01:23:13,225
Well, I remember
the good times
way back when

1561
01:23:20,067 --> 01:23:24,695
Memories will fade
if you wanted me
to let you go

1562
01:23:27,491 --> 01:23:31,702
I've got you on your way
I feel it for you,
don't you know

1563
01:23:31,787 --> 01:23:34,413
We're superheroes and villains

1564
01:23:35,374 --> 01:23:37,708
When we used to pretend

1565
01:23:38,794 --> 01:23:44,882
We'd go wherever our minds
would take us way back when

1566
01:23:49,679 --> 01:23:53,808
Memories will fade
if you wanted me
to let you go

1567
01:23:56,978 --> 01:24:01,148
I've got you on your way
I feel it for you,
don't you know

1568
01:24:04,111 --> 01:24:08,572
It's a promise that I made
Never be afraid

1569
01:24:11,827 --> 01:24:16,163
I know we'll be okay
This luck we have,
it cannot go

1570
01:24:17,165 --> 01:24:19,291
'Cause you're on your own

1571
01:24:20,836 --> 01:24:23,170
You're not alone

1572
01:24:24,506 --> 01:24:30,136
I know I'll see you again
Again

1573
01:24:31,930 --> 01:24:34,432
And if all these things

1574
01:24:35,225 --> 01:24:38,144
Come to an end

1575
01:24:38,895 --> 01:24:43,691
We'll always have
a way back when

1576
01:24:50,740 --> 01:24:54,785
Memories will fade
if you wanted me
to let you go

1577
01:24:58,039 --> 01:25:02,376
I've got you on your way
I feel it for you,
don't you know

1578
01:25:05,255 --> 01:25:09,258
It's a promise that I made
Never be afraid

1579
01:25:12,637 --> 01:25:17,600
I know we'll be okay
This luck we have,
it cannot go
