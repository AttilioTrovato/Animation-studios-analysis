1
00:00:51,135 --> 00:00:52,136
<i>Once upon a time...</i>

2
00:00:52,303 --> 00:00:55,139
<i>in a happy forest,
in the happiest tree...</i>

3
00:00:56,057 --> 00:00:58,810
<i>lived the happiest creatures
the world has ever known.</i>

4
00:00:58,893 --> 00:00:59,811
<i>The Trolls.</i>

5
00:01:01,813 --> 00:01:05,900
<i>They loved nothing more
than to sing, and dance, and hug.</i>

6
00:01:06,067 --> 00:01:09,821
<i>Dance, and hug, and sing, and dance,
and sing, and hug, and dance...</i>

7
00:01:09,988 --> 00:01:11,823
<i>and hug, and dance, and sing, and hug,
and dance, and hug...</i>

8
00:01:14,325 --> 00:01:17,495
<i>But then one day,
the Trolls were discovered by...</i>

9
00:01:17,662 --> 00:01:19,080
a <i>Bergen!</i>

10
00:01:20,498 --> 00:01:22,250
<i>The Bergens didn't know how to sing...</i>

11
00:01:23,001 --> 00:01:24,419
<i>or dance...</i>

12
00:01:24,502 --> 00:01:26,004
<i>or even hug.</i>

13
00:01:26,087 --> 00:01:29,007
<i>They were the most
miserable creatures in all the land.</i>

14
00:01:29,924 --> 00:01:32,176
<i>And once they saw
how happy the Trolls were...</i>

15
00:01:32,343 --> 00:01:34,929
<i>they wanted some of that happiness
for themselves.</i>

16
00:01:38,683 --> 00:01:39,809
Oh, my God!

17
00:01:40,226 --> 00:01:43,021
<i>Eating a Troll made them feel so happy...</i>

18
00:01:43,187 --> 00:01:45,064
<i>they started a tradition.</i>

19
00:01:45,231 --> 00:01:47,358
<i>Once a year, every year...</i>

20
00:01:47,525 --> 00:01:49,861
<i>the Bergens would gather
around the Troll Tree...</i>

21
00:01:50,028 --> 00:01:51,863
<i>to taste happiness...</i>

22
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:55,033
<i>on a holiday they called...</i>

23
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:56,367
<i>Trollstice.</i>

24
00:02:14,052 --> 00:02:15,637
Good morning, Daddy!

25
00:02:16,387 --> 00:02:17,388
Daddy, wake up!

26
00:02:17,555 --> 00:02:20,308
Daddy, wake up!
Wake up! Wake up, Daddy!

27
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,311
Wake up, Daddy.

28
00:02:23,478 --> 00:02:25,647
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

29
00:02:25,855 --> 00:02:27,148
Daddy, wake up!

30
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:30,401
Gristle! What time is it?

31
00:02:30,735 --> 00:02:33,946
It's Trollstice!

32
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,076
Trollstice! Our one day to be happy.

33
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:39,118
Yeah!

34
00:02:39,285 --> 00:02:41,663
Trolls! Trolls! Trolls!

35
00:02:43,289 --> 00:02:45,124
Trolls! Trolls! Trolls!

36
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:53,174
Please give it up
for your Keeper of the Trolls...

37
00:02:53,341 --> 00:02:55,468
your Minister of Happiness...

38
00:02:55,635 --> 00:02:57,095
your Royal Chef...

39
00:02:58,262 --> 00:02:59,263
Me.

40
00:03:07,522 --> 00:03:10,441
This is a very special Trollstice...

41
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:14,153
as there is one amongst us
who has never tasted a Troll.

42
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,656
Me! She is talking about me!

43
00:03:16,823 --> 00:03:17,990
Prince Gristle...

44
00:03:18,783 --> 00:03:20,618
the time has come.

45
00:03:20,785 --> 00:03:21,786
It's okay, son.

46
00:03:21,953 --> 00:03:25,289
I remember being nervous
my first time.

47
00:03:25,456 --> 00:03:26,499
Okay.

48
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:28,668
That's my boy.

49
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,214
It is my sacred duty...

50
00:03:33,381 --> 00:03:37,343
to initiate you
in the ways of true happiness.

51
00:03:40,555 --> 00:03:44,642
I have chosen an extra-special Troll,
just for you.

52
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,396
The happiest, the most positive...

53
00:03:49,147 --> 00:03:50,815
sweetest Troll of all.

54
00:03:50,982 --> 00:03:53,818
And because every prince
deserves a princess...

55
00:03:53,985 --> 00:03:57,864
I give you the one
they call Princess Poppy.

56
00:03:58,656 --> 00:04:00,658
Please make me happy, Princess Poppy.

57
00:04:01,826 --> 00:04:02,869
What are you feeling?

58
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,914
That one's rotten!

59
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,042
It's fake?

60
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:11,002
Fake?

61
00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:12,170
Fake?

62
00:04:14,172 --> 00:04:15,339
They're gone?

63
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:17,383
Where are they?

64
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,844
Don't worry, sire. We'll find them.

65
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:23,181
I think I hear something!

66
00:04:24,849 --> 00:04:26,184
Go! Go!

67
00:04:26,893 --> 00:04:27,894
We got Poppy!

68
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,353
- Pass her to me!
- Here comes Poppy!

69
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,688
Here she is!

70
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:32,857
There's my princess.

71
00:04:33,024 --> 00:04:34,025
Da-da.

72
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:36,903
King Peppy, some of the others
can't keep up.

73
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:39,447
No Troll left behind!

74
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,367
Thank you, King Peppy!

75
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:45,870
- Thank you, King Peppy!
- Thank you!

76
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:48,372
Thank you, King Peppy.

77
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:51,709
No Troll left behind!

78
00:04:54,712 --> 00:04:56,214
Daddy, where are they?

79
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:59,425
Don't just stand there!
Make my son happy!

80
00:04:59,592 --> 00:05:01,594
He will be happy!

81
00:05:23,241 --> 00:05:24,450
Where is he?

82
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:31,582
I don't think King Peppy made it.

83
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:38,965
When I say no Troll left behind...

84
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:45,096
I mean, no Troll left behind!

85
00:05:47,807 --> 00:05:50,518
King Peppy, where's Princess Poppy?

86
00:05:50,685 --> 00:05:52,812
Don't worry. She's safe.

87
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:55,439
No Troll left behind!

88
00:05:56,941 --> 00:05:58,943
But we'll be a lot safer
the further we get from Bergen Town.

89
00:05:59,277 --> 00:06:01,153
Go, go! Hurry!

90
00:06:02,697 --> 00:06:05,366
<i>That's right! Take her away!</i>

91
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:07,159
Get her out of my sight!

92
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:12,123
She is hereby banished
from Bergen Town forever.

93
00:06:13,332 --> 00:06:14,834
We can all be happy again.

94
00:06:15,001 --> 00:06:16,878
I'll find the Trolls!

95
00:06:18,671 --> 00:06:22,758
And shove them down
your ungrateful throats.

96
00:06:30,391 --> 00:06:32,310
But, Daddy...

97
00:06:32,852 --> 00:06:35,313
I never got to eat a Troll.

98
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:38,858
What's gonna make me happy now?

99
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,070
Come here, son.

100
00:06:45,823 --> 00:06:46,991
Nothing.

101
00:06:47,158 --> 00:06:50,161
Absolutely nothing.

102
00:06:50,328 --> 00:06:54,665
You will never, ever, ever,
ever be happy.

103
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:56,500
Never?

104
00:06:57,335 --> 00:06:58,336
Even

105
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:13,517
Here! Right here!

106
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:17,521
This is where we will
rebuild our civilization.

107
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:21,525
It has everything we need.

108
00:07:21,692 --> 00:07:24,111
Fresh air, clean water...

109
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:26,697
and sweet acoustics.

110
00:07:33,037 --> 00:07:36,457
<i>Ba de ya
Say do you remember</i>

111
00:07:36,624 --> 00:07:40,378
<i>Ba de ya
Dancing in September</i>

112
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:44,882
<i>Ba de ya
Never was a cloudy day</i>

113
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:51,430
Twenty years ago today,
King Peppy made us safe...

114
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:54,642
and now every Troll is free
to be happy and live in perfect...

115
00:07:54,976 --> 00:07:55,601
<i>Harmony</i>

116
00:07:55,768 --> 00:07:56,560
<i>Harmony</i>

117
00:07:56,727 --> 00:07:58,062
<i>Harmony</i>

118
00:07:58,229 --> 00:08:00,398
And that's why we hug every hour.

119
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:01,315
Yep.

120
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:03,275
I wish it was every half hour.

121
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:04,443
So do I.

122
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:07,154
But that wouldn't leave much time
for singing and dancing, now would it?

123
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:10,491
Princess Poppy, do the Bergens
still want to eat us?

124
00:08:10,658 --> 00:08:11,492
You bet!

125
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:15,246
But just because it's the only way
they'll ever be happy.

126
00:08:15,955 --> 00:08:18,290
Oh, no. I do taste delicious.

127
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:21,585
Isn't there anything else
to make them happy?

128
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:23,462
What about having birthday parties?

129
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:24,964
Or slumber parties?

130
00:08:25,131 --> 00:08:28,300
Or staring at your parents
while they sleep.

131
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:31,095
But I don't want to be food.

132
00:08:31,262 --> 00:08:33,973
Don't worry. No Troll ever will be.

133
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:37,768
And that's why we're celebrating
with the biggest party ever.

134
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:39,854
Everybody's gonna be there.

135
00:08:40,021 --> 00:08:41,814
Everybody?

136
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:43,482
Everybody.

137
00:08:48,446 --> 00:08:52,950
<i>Everybody, move your hair and feel united</i>

138
00:08:56,454 --> 00:09:00,875
<i>Everybody, shake your hair and feel united</i>

139
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:07,715
<i>Yeah
Everybody's coming to the celebration</i>

140
00:09:07,882 --> 00:09:11,844
<i>I 'ma hook you up with the invitation
Let your hair swing and party with me</i>

141
00:09:12,011 --> 00:09:13,637
<i>No bad vibes
Just love, you'll see</i>

142
00:09:14,138 --> 00:09:17,850
<i>Do the D-A-N-C-E
One-two-three-four fight</i>

143
00:09:18,017 --> 00:09:20,811
<i>Stick to the B-E-A-T
Get ready to</i>

144
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:21,979
<i>Ignite</i>

145
00:09:22,146 --> 00:09:26,025
<i>You are such a P-Y-T
Catching all the lights</i>

146
00:09:26,192 --> 00:09:29,820
<i>Just easy as A-B-C
That's how you make it right</i>

147
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:31,822
<i>It ain't hard out here
When you're doing it right</i>

148
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:34,325
<i>Put a smile on blast
That's the Troll life</i>

149
00:09:34,492 --> 00:09:38,496
<i>And I'm here to help you through it
Come on, Smidge, I know you can do it</i>

150
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:41,165
Your confidence gives me strength.

151
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:50,341
Okay, Mr. Dinkles.

152
00:09:50,508 --> 00:09:52,176
Say, leaves!

153
00:09:55,096 --> 00:09:56,430
Something's missing.

154
00:09:59,934 --> 00:10:00,893
That's it!

155
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:04,396
<i>Don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop the beat</i>

156
00:10:04,563 --> 00:10:06,357
<i>I can't stop, can't stop
Can't stop the beat</i>

157
00:10:06,524 --> 00:10:08,234
<i>I won't stop, won't stop
Won't stop the beat</i>

158
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,443
<i>Go!</i>

159
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:15,866
<i>Everybody, shake your hair and feel united</i>

160
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:21,705
<i>Sunshine day, everybody's singing</i>

161
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:23,207
<i>Sunshine day</i>

162
00:10:23,374 --> 00:10:28,170
<i>Everybody, move your hair and feel united</i>

163
00:10:37,096 --> 00:10:38,180
Yeah!

164
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:47,898
Unbelievable, guys.

165
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:49,942
Really, really great. Good job.

166
00:10:50,109 --> 00:10:52,069
I could hear you from a mile away!

167
00:10:52,236 --> 00:10:54,321
Good. I was worried we weren't
projecting enough.

168
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:58,409
Poppy, if I can hear you,
so can the Bergens.

169
00:10:58,576 --> 00:10:59,493
Oh, boy.

170
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,995
- Here we go again.
- Oh, Branch...

171
00:11:01,162 --> 00:11:02,413
You always ruin everything.

172
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,998
Warning us about the Bergens.

173
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,374
No, I don't.

174
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:07,960
The Bergens are coming!

175
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:11,130
The Bergens are coming!

176
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:14,049
The Bergens are coming!

177
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:18,053
Come on! We haven't seen a Bergen
in 20 years.

178
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,388
They're not gonna find us.

179
00:11:19,555 --> 00:11:23,100
No, they're not going to find me,
because I'll be in my highly camouflaged...

180
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:25,936
heavily fortified,
Bergen-proof survival bunker.

181
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:27,771
You mean you're not coming
to the party tonight?

182
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:29,523
But it's going to be the biggest...

183
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:30,482
The loudest...

184
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:32,484
The craziest party ever!

185
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:35,779
Big? Loud?

186
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:36,906
Crazy?

187
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:39,200
You're just gonna lead the Bergens
right to us!

188
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:43,037
Are you sure you wanna invite
this party pooper to poop on your party?

189
00:11:43,204 --> 00:11:45,915
Yes. I think everyone deserves
to be happy.

190
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:47,374
I don't do happy-

191
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:50,211
Branch, I know you have happiness
inside you.

192
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,463
You just need our help to find it.

193
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:58,135
<i>Celebrate freedom from
The Bergens</i>

194
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,897
What do you say, Branch?

195
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:14,652
Oh, my God.

196
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:17,154
I wouldn't be caught dead at your party,
but you will be.

197
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:18,781
Caught and dead.

198
00:12:18,948 --> 00:12:20,032
Whoa, whoa.

199
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:22,159
Easy, Branch. Easy.

200
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,081
Thank you for providing
safe passage, brother.

201
00:12:27,248 --> 00:12:28,666
Namaste.

202
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:33,462
Okay, first of all, mate, thanks for sharing
your unique perspective on things.

203
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:34,630
Again.

204
00:12:34,797 --> 00:12:38,759
But, just for now, why don't you try on
some positivity, eh?

205
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:41,595
A little positivity might go with that vest.

206
00:12:41,804 --> 00:12:42,972
Okay, fine.

207
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:46,141
I'm positive
you all are going to get eaten.

208
00:12:47,685 --> 00:12:49,561
- Hug time!
- It is hug time.

209
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:51,647
Hug time!

210
00:12:51,814 --> 00:12:53,732
- That feels good.
- Our hearts are synchronizing!

211
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:56,151
<i>I can squeeze you forever</i>

212
00:12:58,654 --> 00:13:00,739
Someday, when the Bergens find us...

213
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:03,450
and the survival of every Troll
is in your hands...

214
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:06,078
I sure hope the answer
is singing, dancing, and hugging...

215
00:13:06,245 --> 00:13:07,830
because that's all you know how to do.

216
00:13:07,997 --> 00:13:11,166
That is not true!
Poppy can also scrapbook.

217
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:14,086
I can't believe
you're gonna be queen one day.

218
00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:20,551
Tune out his negative vibrations, Poppy.
They're toxic.

219
00:13:20,718 --> 00:13:23,804
Some folks just don't want to be happy.

220
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:25,097
I guess.

221
00:13:25,264 --> 00:13:26,432
You guessed right.

222
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:27,850
Boop.

223
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,105
Yeah!

224
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:40,404
I love you so much!

225
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:47,453
Yeah!

226
00:13:48,287 --> 00:13:49,830
Whoo! Glitter!

227
00:13:55,169 --> 00:13:56,837
YOLO!

228
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:14,229
More glitter!

229
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:19,318
Turn it up!

230
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:40,547
I can't hear you!

231
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,428
Trolls.

232
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,263
Okay, everyone.

233
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,432
I just want to take a moment...

234
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:52,184
and get a little real.

235
00:14:52,351 --> 00:14:53,310
Poppy!

236
00:14:53,477 --> 00:14:55,104
She's my friend! I know her!

237
00:14:57,815 --> 00:15:02,486
I'd like to take a second
to celebrate our king...

238
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:03,529
my father...

239
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,782
who, 20 years ago this night...

240
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:09,701
saved all of us from those dreaded...

241
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,459
Bergens.

242
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:23,841
Gotcha.

243
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,764
Cupcake?

244
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,269
Run!

245
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:37,521
Run! Run!

246
00:15:38,564 --> 00:15:39,273
PQppy, help!

247
00:15:39,982 --> 00:15:41,024
Mr. Dinkles?

248
00:15:41,191 --> 00:15:43,110
Has anybody seen Mr. Dinkles?

249
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:45,028
Biggie!

250
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:48,198
Blend in! Blend in! Blend in!

251
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:49,491
Poppy!

252
00:15:50,451 --> 00:15:51,577
Run!

253
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,622
Run, Smidge!

254
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:56,665
Oh, my God!

255
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,836
PQppy, help!

256
00:16:01,003 --> 00:16:01,962
Hurry!

257
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:04,006
Go! Go! Go!

258
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:06,758
Cooper!

259
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:08,719
Everyone, minimize your auras!

260
00:16:08,886 --> 00:16:10,387
- Creek!
- No! Poppy!

261
00:16:12,431 --> 00:16:13,682
- Hold on.
4300M!

262
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,393
- No!
- Creek!

263
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:23,192
Bad Bergen! Bad, bad Bergen.

264
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:26,028
Bad, bad Bergen!

265
00:16:26,195 --> 00:16:26,987
Dad!

266
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:48,467
Thanks for throwing the biggest...

267
00:16:48,634 --> 00:16:50,594
the loudest...

268
00:16:50,761 --> 00:16:52,846
The craziest party ever.

269
00:17:35,973 --> 00:17:37,849
Is it coming back?

270
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:40,143
What are we gonna do now?

271
00:17:40,644 --> 00:17:43,188
We have to find a new home.
Everyone, hurry.

272
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:45,524
We have to leave
before the Bergens come back.

273
00:17:45,691 --> 00:17:46,817
We have to rescue them.

274
00:17:46,984 --> 00:17:50,153
No, Poppy, we have to run.
Now, let's go, everyone. Come on!

275
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,532
What about "No Troll left behind"?

276
00:17:54,825 --> 00:17:55,867
I'm sorry, POPPY-

277
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:59,913
That was a long time ago.
And I'm not the king I once was.

278
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:03,166
Then I'll go.

279
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,835
I'll go and save them.

280
00:18:05,002 --> 00:18:07,504
No, Poppy. It's too dangerous.

281
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:09,089
I have to at least try.

282
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:12,175
No. You can't go to Bergen Town
by yourself.

283
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:13,760
It's impossible.

284
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:22,519
<i>Celebrate freedom from
the Bergens</i>

285
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:28,483
<i>Celebrate freedom from
the Bergens</i>

286
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:41,038
<i>Branch, you're invited!</i>

287
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:42,414
No!No!No!

288
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,710
Branch! Branch! Branch!

289
00:18:46,877 --> 00:18:48,378
Branch, are you in there?

290
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:50,130
I'm not going to your party.

291
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:52,966
The party's over.
We just got attacked by a Bergen.

292
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:54,301
I knew it.

293
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:07,230
Branch!

294
00:19:07,731 --> 00:19:09,149
I have to tell you something.

295
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:10,817
I was just gonna...

296
00:19:14,446 --> 00:19:15,405
What?

297
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:18,659
What could be so important that it's
worth leading the Bergen right to us?

298
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:19,743
The Bergen's gone!

299
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,787
You don't know that.
It could still be out there.

300
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:22,913
Watching.

301
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,081
Waiting.

302
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:25,832
Listening.

303
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:27,417
No. It left!

304
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:30,087
It took Cooper, and Smidge,
and Fuzzbert...

305
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:34,091
and Satin, and Chenille, and Biggie,
and Guy Diamond, and Creek!

306
00:19:34,633 --> 00:19:36,802
Which is why I have to ask you.

307
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:39,763
Will you go to Bergen Town with me
and save everyone?

308
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:41,139
What? No.

309
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:43,308
Branch, you can't say no.
They're your friends.

310
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:45,102
They're your friends.

311
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:47,020
I'm staying right here
in my bunker where it's safe.

312
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:48,271
That's great.

313
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:50,357
You're the one guy who knows
more about Bergens than anyone...

314
00:19:50,524 --> 00:19:53,110
but when we finally need you,
you just want to hide here forever?

315
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:55,779
Forever? No.

316
00:19:57,698 --> 00:19:58,532
Yeah...

317
00:19:58,699 --> 00:20:02,035
I really only have enough supplies
down here to last me 10 years...

318
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:04,788
11 if I'm willing to store
and drink my own sweat.

319
00:20:04,955 --> 00:20:06,456
Which I am.

320
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:08,208
You all said I was crazy, huh?

321
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,293
Well, who's crazy now?

322
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:13,004
Me. Crazy prepared.

323
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:15,799
I'm sorry.
I should have listened to you.

324
00:20:15,966 --> 00:20:19,136
You told me not to throw the party,
and I threw it anyway.

325
00:20:19,302 --> 00:20:20,637
And it's my fault they were taken.

326
00:20:20,804 --> 00:20:22,305
And now I don't know what to do.

327
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:24,975
Why don't you try
scrapbooking them to freedom?

328
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:27,352
Solid burn, Branch.

329
00:20:29,146 --> 00:20:31,481
Well, thanks anyway.

330
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:33,817
Hey, anytime, Poppy.
See you in 10 years.

331
00:20:51,752 --> 00:20:53,003
Oh, hey, Branch?

332
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:55,338
Just wondering
if I could borrow something.

333
00:20:55,505 --> 00:20:56,339
What?

334
00:20:56,506 --> 00:20:57,883
- Your bunker.
- What?

335
00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:00,177
Okay, everybody. Come on in!

336
00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:02,512
Hi, Branch!

337
00:21:03,513 --> 00:21:05,056
No!No!No!

338
00:21:05,223 --> 00:21:07,184
Whoa, wait!
Poppy, what are you doing?

339
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:10,187
You said you have enough provisions
to last 10 years, right?

340
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:12,522
Yes, to last me 10 years. Me!

341
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:13,857
It'll last them two weeks!

342
00:21:14,024 --> 00:21:15,567
Then I guess I better hurry.

343
00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:16,693
Wait, wait, wait!

344
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,361
You won't last a day out there.

345
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:20,489
And you won't last a day in here.

346
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:22,991
Chug, Chug, chug!

347
00:21:26,536 --> 00:21:28,872
Solid burn, returned.

348
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,665
Sorry, Branch!

349
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:32,542
Poppy, wait.

350
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:35,420
Please be careful.

351
00:21:35,587 --> 00:21:38,673
Don't worry, Dad. I can do this.

352
00:21:39,883 --> 00:21:41,885
I love you, POPPY-

353
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:44,596
I love you too, Dad.

354
00:21:49,226 --> 00:21:51,603
They grow up so fast.

355
00:21:52,062 --> 00:21:53,855
Bye, everybody! See you soon!

356
00:21:54,022 --> 00:21:56,233
Good luck, Princess Poppy!

357
00:21:57,776 --> 00:22:01,071
And three, two, one.

358
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:04,574
Hug time!

359
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:05,909
No.

360
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:07,410
Hug time! Hug time! Hug time!

361
00:22:07,577 --> 00:22:09,579
No! No!

362
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:14,960
<i>With her friends safely hidden...</i>

363
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:17,754
<i>Princess Poppy set off
to rescue her other friends...</i>

364
00:22:17,921 --> 00:22:21,091
<i>confident she'd make it
to Bergen Town on her own.</i>

365
00:22:24,219 --> 00:22:26,429
<i>Convinced she'd make it to Bergen Town.</i>

366
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:36,439
Totally sure she'd make it
to Bergen Town.

367
00:22:47,617 --> 00:22:50,120
<i>I really hope I can do it</i>

368
00:22:50,287 --> 00:22:52,956
<i>'Cause they're all depending on me</i>

369
00:22:53,623 --> 00:22:58,169
<i>I know that I must leave
the only home I've ever known</i>

370
00:22:58,336 --> 00:23:03,341
<i>And brave the dangers of the forest
Saving them before they're eaten</i>

371
00:23:04,092 --> 00:23:09,472
<i>I mean, how hard can that be?</i>

372
00:23:18,982 --> 00:23:23,194
<i>Looking up at a sunny sky
So shiny and blue and there's a butterfly</i>

373
00:23:23,361 --> 00:23:26,156
<i>Well, isn't that a super fantastic sign?</i>

374
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:37,500
<i>It's gonna be a fantastic day</i>

375
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:39,628
<i>Such marvelousness it's gonna bring</i>

376
00:23:39,794 --> 00:23:42,005
<i>Got a pocket full of songs
that I'm gonna sing</i>

377
00:23:42,172 --> 00:23:44,966
<i>And I'm ready to take on anything</i>

378
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:46,635
<i>Hooray!</i>

379
00:23:46,801 --> 00:23:51,306
<i>Some super fun surprise
around each corner</i>

380
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,351
<i>Just riding on a rainbow</i>

381
00:23:54,517 --> 00:23:56,811
<i>I'm gonna be okay</i>

382
00:23:56,978 --> 00:23:59,397
<i>Hey! I'm not giving up today</i>

383
00:24:00,357 --> 00:24:02,150
<i>There's nothing getting in my way</i>

384
00:24:02,567 --> 00:24:04,194
<i>And if you knock, knock me over</i>

385
00:24:04,361 --> 00:24:06,863
<i>I will get back up again</i>

386
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:09,908
<i>Oh! If something goes a little wrong</i>

387
00:24:10,075 --> 00:24:12,160
<i>Well you can go ahead and bring it on</i>

388
00:24:12,327 --> 00:24:13,745
<i>'Cause if you knock, knock me over</i>

389
00:24:13,912 --> 00:24:16,706
<i>I will get back up again</i>

390
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:20,877
<i>Get back up again</i>

391
00:24:26,174 --> 00:24:28,176
<i>I'm marching along
I've got confidence</i>

392
00:24:28,343 --> 00:24:30,428
<i>I'm cooler than a pack of peppermints</i>

393
00:24:30,595 --> 00:24:33,056
<i>And I haven't been this excited</i>

394
00:24:33,223 --> 00:24:35,558
<i>since I can't remember when</i>

395
00:24:35,725 --> 00:24:40,188
<i>I'm off on this remarkable adventure</i>

396
00:24:40,355 --> 00:24:42,857
<i>Just riding on a rainbow</i>

397
00:24:43,024 --> 00:24:45,235
<i>But what if it's all a big mistake?</i>

398
00:24:45,402 --> 00:24:47,904
<i>What if it's more than I can take?</i>

399
00:24:48,071 --> 00:24:49,698
<i>No, I can't think that way</i>

400
00:24:49,864 --> 00:24:53,910
<i>'Cause I know that
I'm really, really, really gonna be okay</i>

401
00:24:54,077 --> 00:24:57,205
<i>Hey! I'm not giving up today</i>

402
00:24:57,372 --> 00:24:59,749
<i>There's nothing getting in my way</i>

403
00:24:59,916 --> 00:25:00,917
<i>And if you knock, knock me over</i>

404
00:25:01,084 --> 00:25:04,087
<i>I will get back up again</i>

405
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:09,092
<i>If something goes a little wrong
Well you can go ahead and bring it on</i>

406
00:25:09,259 --> 00:25:10,927
<i>'Cause if you knock, knock me over</i>

407
00:25:11,094 --> 00:25:14,055
<i>I will get back up again</i>

408
00:25:16,891 --> 00:25:18,268
<i>Get back up again</i>

409
00:25:22,605 --> 00:25:24,441
I'm okay!

410
00:25:27,902 --> 00:25:30,405
<i>And if you knock, knock me over
You knock, knock me over</i>

411
00:25:30,572 --> 00:25:35,118
<i>I will get back up again</i>

412
00:26:27,504 --> 00:26:28,630
Get back!

413
00:26:44,562 --> 00:26:46,231
Oh no! Poppy?

414
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:48,525
Hang on!

415
00:26:54,906 --> 00:26:56,825
<i>Get back up again</i>

416
00:26:56,991 --> 00:26:58,201
Branch, my man!

417
00:26:58,368 --> 00:26:59,369
You are right on time.

418
00:26:59,536 --> 00:27:01,538
Oh, right.
Like you knew I was coming.

419
00:27:01,704 --> 00:27:03,164
Yes! I figured after the third
hug time...

420
00:27:03,331 --> 00:27:04,999
getting eaten by a Bergen
wouldn't seem so bad.

421
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:07,877
And I figured there was no way
you could do this by yourself.

422
00:27:08,044 --> 00:27:09,087
Guess we were both right.

423
00:27:10,046 --> 00:27:11,381
All right. Let's do this!

424
00:27:11,548 --> 00:27:14,008
Sooner we get to Bergen Town,
sooner we can rescue everybody...

425
00:27:14,175 --> 00:27:15,218
and make it home safely.

426
00:27:15,385 --> 00:27:17,262
Wait, wait, wait. What's your plan?

427
00:27:17,428 --> 00:27:19,722
I just told you. To rescue everyone
and make it home safely.

428
00:27:19,889 --> 00:27:22,267
Okay. That's not a plan.
That's a wish list.

429
00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:24,519
Oh! I suppose you have a plan.

430
00:27:25,854 --> 00:27:27,105
First...

431
00:27:27,689 --> 00:27:30,441
<i>we get to the edge of Bergen Town
without being spotted.</i>

432
00:27:30,608 --> 00:27:33,194
<i>Then, we get inside by sneaking
through the old escape tunnels...</i>

433
00:27:33,361 --> 00:27:35,280
<i>which will then lead us
to the Troll Tree...</i>

434
00:27:35,446 --> 00:27:38,032
<i>right before we get caught,
and suffer a miserable death...</i>

435
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:40,785
<i>at the hands of a horrible,
bloodthirsty Bergen!</i>

436
00:27:40,952 --> 00:27:43,246
Hold on a second,
are you scrapbooking my plan?

437
00:27:43,413 --> 00:27:45,748
Yeah. Almost...

438
00:27:45,915 --> 00:27:46,916
done!

439
00:27:47,709 --> 00:27:49,127
<i>We did it!</i>

440
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:58,261
There will be no more...

441
00:28:00,221 --> 00:28:01,472
scrapbooking.

442
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:05,935
Do you have to sing?

443
00:28:06,102 --> 00:28:07,645
I always sing when I'm in a good mood.

444
00:28:07,812 --> 00:28:09,272
Do you have to be in a good mood?

445
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:10,440
Why wouldn't I be?

446
00:28:10,607 --> 00:28:13,109
By this time tomorrow,
I'll be with all my friends!

447
00:28:13,276 --> 00:28:15,445
I wonder what they're doing right now.

448
00:28:15,612 --> 00:28:16,988
Probably being digested.

449
00:28:17,155 --> 00:28:18,948
They're alive, Branch. I know it!

450
00:28:19,115 --> 00:28:20,491
You don't know anything, Poppy.

451
00:28:20,658 --> 00:28:22,285
And I can't wait
to see the look on your face...

452
00:28:22,452 --> 00:28:25,288
when you realize the world
isn't all cupcakes and rainbows.

453
00:28:25,455 --> 00:28:26,331
'Cause it isn't.

454
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:28,333
Bad things happen...

455
00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:30,960
and there's nothing you can do about it.

456
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,672
Hey, I know it's not
all cupcakes and rainbows.

457
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:37,133
But I'd rather go through life
thinking that it mostly is...

458
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,593
instead of being like you.

459
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,261
You don't sing, you don't dance.

460
00:28:40,428 --> 00:28:43,306
So grey all the time!
What happened to you?

461
00:28:45,183 --> 00:28:46,309
A Bergen?

462
00:28:46,851 --> 00:28:47,977
Maybe.

463
00:28:51,981 --> 00:28:53,483
There's no Bergen, is there?

464
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,944
You just said that so I'd stop talking.

465
00:28:56,611 --> 00:28:57,612
Maybe.

466
00:29:20,802 --> 00:29:22,679
So special.

467
00:29:24,347 --> 00:29:25,556
Goodnight, Cooper.

468
00:29:26,015 --> 00:29:28,685
Good night, Smidge.
Good night, Fuzzbert.

469
00:29:28,851 --> 00:29:30,895
Good night, Satin. Good night, Chenille.

470
00:29:31,062 --> 00:29:33,564
Good night, Biggie. Good night, DJ.

471
00:29:33,731 --> 00:29:35,066
Good night, Guy Diamond.

472
00:29:35,858 --> 00:29:37,026
Good night, Creek.

473
00:29:37,527 --> 00:29:38,528
Boop.

474
00:29:38,695 --> 00:29:40,029
And good night, Poppy.

475
00:29:48,663 --> 00:29:51,708
Don't even think about it.

476
00:30:02,385 --> 00:30:06,389
<i>Stars shining bright above you</i>

477
00:30:06,556 --> 00:30:08,558
Really? Seriously? More singing?

478
00:30:08,725 --> 00:30:11,561
Yes, seriously! Singing helps me relax.

479
00:30:11,728 --> 00:30:13,021
Maybe you ought to try it.

480
00:30:13,187 --> 00:30:17,400
I don't sing, and I don't relax.
This is the way I am, and I like it.

481
00:30:17,567 --> 00:30:19,777
I also like a little silence.

482
00:30:29,037 --> 00:30:32,415
<i>Hello Darkness, my old friend</i>

483
00:30:33,249 --> 00:30:35,626
<i>I've come to talk with you again</i>

484
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,754
Hello.

485
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:41,424
<i>Because a vision softly creeping</i>

486
00:30:42,592 --> 00:30:47,221
<i>Left its seeds while I was sleeping</i>

487
00:30:47,388 --> 00:30:52,935
<i>And the vision that was planted in my brain</i>

488
00:30:54,062 --> 00:30:56,481
<i>Still remains</i>

489
00:30:57,231 --> 00:31:01,110
<i>Within the sound...</i>

490
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:05,031
<i>of silence</i>

491
00:31:10,703 --> 00:31:11,954
May I?

492
00:31:23,966 --> 00:31:26,219
So one of these tunnels
leads to the Troll Tree.

493
00:31:26,386 --> 00:31:27,220
That's right.

494
00:31:27,387 --> 00:31:28,971
There's so many of them.

495
00:31:29,305 --> 00:31:30,556
I wonder which one.

496
00:31:30,723 --> 00:31:32,183
I don't know.

497
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:35,520
Choose a hole wisely!

498
00:31:35,686 --> 00:31:38,815
For one will lead to Bergen Town...

499
00:31:38,981 --> 00:31:41,984
and the others, to certain death.

500
00:31:42,151 --> 00:31:43,152
Who said that?

501
00:31:43,653 --> 00:31:45,822
It was...

502
00:31:46,656 --> 00:31:47,532
me.

503
00:31:47,698 --> 00:31:50,910
Hey, guys, how's it going?
Welcome to the root tunnels.

504
00:31:51,077 --> 00:31:52,203
I just wanted to warn you.

505
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:54,497
One of these tunnels leads
to the Troll Tree...

506
00:31:54,664 --> 00:31:58,000
and the others to certain death,
death, death, death...

507
00:32:00,002 --> 00:32:02,171
Do you think you can tell us
which is the right one?

508
00:32:02,338 --> 00:32:03,256
You bet!

509
00:32:03,423 --> 00:32:05,425
- Great!
- No, that's okay. We're fine, thanks!

510
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:06,551
Branch.

511
00:32:06,717 --> 00:32:07,844
He's trying to help us.

512
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:09,512
I don't like the looks of him.

513
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,848
I mean, who wears socks with no shoes?

514
00:32:13,224 --> 00:32:15,393
He seems to know what he's talking about.

515
00:32:16,352 --> 00:32:18,229
Okay, fine.

516
00:32:18,604 --> 00:32:19,939
Which way do we go?

517
00:32:20,106 --> 00:32:22,859
First, you have to give me a high five.
Then I'll tell you.

518
00:32:23,025 --> 00:32:25,027
- What?
- I love high fives. I'll do it.

519
00:32:25,194 --> 00:32:26,529
Oh, I know you'll do it.

520
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,281
But will he?

521
00:32:28,698 --> 00:32:30,575
All right, dumpy diapers, up high!

522
00:32:30,741 --> 00:32:32,034
Nope, I don't do high fives.

523
00:32:32,201 --> 00:32:33,619
- Slap it, boss.
- Not gonna happen.

524
00:32:33,786 --> 00:32:35,413
- Party on the top floor.
- Nope.

525
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,873
Little slappy. Make daddy happy.

526
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,040
That's weird.

527
00:32:38,207 --> 00:32:39,709
Come on, just one little high five.

528
00:32:39,876 --> 00:32:41,586
No, thanks. I'm good.

529
00:32:41,752 --> 00:32:42,879
Here, just do this...

530
00:32:43,379 --> 00:32:44,547
But with your hand.

531
00:32:44,714 --> 00:32:45,882
Thank you for that demonstration.

532
00:32:46,048 --> 00:32:48,092
Really cleared up
exactly what I will not be doing.

533
00:32:48,259 --> 00:32:50,094
Branch, it's a high five.

534
00:32:50,261 --> 00:32:53,306
The others lead to certain death.
Get perspective.

535
00:32:57,101 --> 00:33:00,104
One high five and then you'll tell us
which tunnel to take, right?

536
00:33:00,271 --> 00:33:01,397
So easy.

537
00:33:01,981 --> 00:33:02,899
Okay, fine!

538
00:33:03,441 --> 00:33:04,233
Too slow.

539
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,568
Too slow?

540
00:33:08,154 --> 00:33:09,071
Classic.

541
00:33:09,614 --> 00:33:11,240
No, no. All right.

542
00:33:11,407 --> 00:33:13,576
I'm gonna let you slide
with a fist bump.

543
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:15,995
Shark attack!
Nom-nom-nom-nom. Jellyfish!

544
00:33:16,162 --> 00:33:19,248
Hand sandwich. Turkey. Snowman. Dolphin.
Helicopter. Last Supper. Monkey in a zoo.

545
00:33:19,415 --> 00:33:20,583
- What?
- Gear shift

546
00:33:30,009 --> 00:33:32,303
Okay, okay, okay.
Now I'm thinking we hug.

547
00:33:36,265 --> 00:33:38,935
- That's right. You better run, Cloud!
- Wait!

548
00:33:39,101 --> 00:33:40,353
I'm gonna tear your little cloud arms...

549
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:43,272
off your cloud body,
and high five your face with them!

550
00:33:43,856 --> 00:33:45,608
He's just a cloud!

551
00:33:45,775 --> 00:33:47,610
- Get back here!
- Branch! He can help us!

552
00:33:47,777 --> 00:33:48,819
Come back!

553
00:33:48,986 --> 00:33:49,946
Run, Cloud Guy!

554
00:33:50,112 --> 00:33:51,113
I'm gonna kill you!

555
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,865
Ta-da! We're here!

556
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,285
You guys are a lot of fun.
You know, I gotta go.

557
00:33:56,452 --> 00:33:59,872
Got some cloud stuff to take care of.
Catch you on the way back?

558
00:33:59,956 --> 00:34:00,957
Unless...

559
00:34:01,457 --> 00:34:03,084
you die.

560
00:34:04,961 --> 00:34:06,629
The Troll Tree.

561
00:34:06,796 --> 00:34:08,464
Bergen Town.

562
00:34:23,479 --> 00:34:25,731
<i>I ain't happy
I'm feeling glad</i>

563
00:34:25,898 --> 00:34:30,278
<i>I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless</i>

564
00:34:30,444 --> 00:34:34,323
<i>But not for long
The future is coming on</i>

565
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:37,326
<i>I ain't happy
I'm feeling glad</i>

566
00:34:37,493 --> 00:34:42,164
<i>I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless</i>

567
00:34:42,331 --> 00:34:45,918
<i>But not for long
The future is coming on</i>

568
00:34:46,085 --> 00:34:49,005
<i>Is coming on
Is coming on</i>

569
00:34:49,171 --> 00:34:51,507
<i>Coming on
Is coming on</i>

570
00:34:51,674 --> 00:34:53,593
<i>Is coming on
Is coming on</i>

571
00:34:54,427 --> 00:34:57,346
Wow! They're as miserable as you.

572
00:34:58,014 --> 00:35:01,559
Which means
they haven't eaten a Troll yet.

573
00:35:01,726 --> 00:35:03,686
Now, come on. Let's go save our friends.

574
00:35:03,853 --> 00:35:04,687
Your friends.

575
00:35:04,854 --> 00:35:07,023
Our friends. Don't fight it.

576
00:35:15,281 --> 00:35:16,157
Oh, Barnabus.

577
00:35:17,033 --> 00:35:20,244
You're my only friend
in this whole miserable world.

578
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:23,331
Dad was right.

579
00:35:25,124 --> 00:35:28,919
I'll never ever,
never ever, never be happy.

580
00:35:30,171 --> 00:35:31,213
Never.

581
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:35,551
Never say never.

582
00:35:47,104 --> 00:35:48,939
Chad. Todd.

583
00:35:51,484 --> 00:35:53,152
Chef, where did you come from?

584
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:56,072
My father banished you 20 years ago.

585
00:35:56,238 --> 00:35:58,366
Have you been standing
behind that plant this whole time?

586
00:35:58,532 --> 00:36:00,326
If only, sire.

587
00:36:00,493 --> 00:36:02,286
No. I've been out in the wilderness...

588
00:36:02,453 --> 00:36:05,539
thinking of nothing
but how I let you down.

589
00:36:07,041 --> 00:36:09,919
If only there was some way
I could make you feel better.

590
00:36:10,127 --> 00:36:11,128
Well, fat chance!

591
00:36:11,295 --> 00:36:13,839
The only way I'll ever be happy
is by eating a Troll...

592
00:36:14,006 --> 00:36:15,841
and that ain't gonna happen,
thanks to you.

593
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:19,303
But it just might. Thanks to me.

594
00:36:29,772 --> 00:36:31,774
You found the Trolls.

595
00:36:34,485 --> 00:36:38,572
So this means
I might actually get to be happy!

596
00:36:38,739 --> 00:36:39,657
That's right.

597
00:36:41,575 --> 00:36:45,204
Of course, everyone else in Bergen Town
will still be miserable...

598
00:36:45,371 --> 00:36:47,498
but that's not your concern.

599
00:36:47,665 --> 00:36:50,751
I am their king, so maybe it kinda is.

600
00:36:50,918 --> 00:36:53,170
What exactly are you proposing?

601
00:36:53,337 --> 00:36:56,382
Bringing back Trollstice? For everyone?

602
00:36:57,883 --> 00:37:00,177
Yes! That's exactly what I'm proposing.

603
00:37:00,344 --> 00:37:04,014
Great idea, sire. Absolutely brilliant.
Aren't you smart?

604
00:37:04,181 --> 00:37:05,182
I guess I am.

605
00:37:05,349 --> 00:37:08,519
And I, your loyal Chef,
will be right behind you.

606
00:37:08,686 --> 00:37:09,603
Holding a knife.

607
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:10,521
What's that?

608
00:37:10,688 --> 00:37:12,398
Holding a knife, a spoon, a ladle.

609
00:37:12,565 --> 00:37:14,316
I'm your chef, after all!

610
00:37:14,483 --> 00:37:16,110
Yeah, you sure are!

611
00:37:19,196 --> 00:37:21,240
I'm back!

612
00:37:21,574 --> 00:37:23,284
You, scullery maid, what's your name?

613
00:37:23,451 --> 00:37:24,452
Bfldget

614
00:37:24,618 --> 00:37:26,370
Congratulations, ldget.
You work for me now.

615
00:37:26,537 --> 00:37:29,248
So you take those dishes downstairs
and you start scrubbing.

616
00:37:29,415 --> 00:37:31,417
Yes, Chef. Thank you, Chef.

617
00:37:38,674 --> 00:37:39,967
Don't cry, Mr. Dinkles.

618
00:37:40,676 --> 00:37:43,345
Guys, Mr. Dinkles is really freaking out!

619
00:37:45,097 --> 00:37:49,477
Whoa, whoa! Everyone, we must all remain calm.

620
00:37:49,685 --> 00:37:51,771
<i>Comb</i>

621
00:37:51,937 --> 00:37:55,566
That's right.
A calm Troll is a tasty Troll.

622
00:37:56,692 --> 00:38:00,279
And you are a key ingredient
in my recipe for success.

623
00:38:00,446 --> 00:38:01,405
You see...

624
00:38:01,572 --> 00:38:04,408
he who controls the Trolls
controls the Kingdom.

625
00:38:04,575 --> 00:38:07,286
And I am that "he!"

626
00:38:07,453 --> 00:38:08,329
You're a dude?

627
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:17,129
By this time tomorrow, I'll be queen...

628
00:38:17,296 --> 00:38:20,466
and all of Bergen Town will get
exactly what they deserve.

629
00:38:20,633 --> 00:38:23,385
True happiness!

630
00:38:33,771 --> 00:38:35,272
- Chad.
- Todd.

631
00:38:48,035 --> 00:38:49,787
So where do you think our friends are?

632
00:38:49,954 --> 00:38:53,332
If I had to guess,
I'd say in a Bergen's stomach.

633
00:38:53,791 --> 00:38:55,334
Could you try to be positive?

634
00:38:55,501 --> 00:38:57,378
Just once. You might like it.

635
00:38:57,586 --> 00:38:59,713
Okay. I'm sure they're not only alive...

636
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,925
but about to be delivered
to us on a silver platter.

637
00:39:03,092 --> 00:39:05,386
Thank you.
That wasn't so hard, was it?

638
00:39:08,055 --> 00:39:08,848
Branch!

639
00:39:09,014 --> 00:39:10,641
Hug time? Seriously?

640
00:39:10,808 --> 00:39:11,976
Listen.

641
00:39:17,314 --> 00:39:21,318
This is gonna be the best Trollstice ever!
Such a great idea I had.

642
00:39:22,069 --> 00:39:25,197
Yes. Tomorrow is Trollstice, everyone.
And it must be perfect!

643
00:39:25,364 --> 00:39:26,240
Yes, Chef!

644
00:39:26,407 --> 00:39:29,743
Feels great to be ordering
everyone around again.

645
00:39:29,994 --> 00:39:31,036
Branch, look!

646
00:39:31,203 --> 00:39:32,204
They're alive?

647
00:39:32,371 --> 00:39:34,874
And on a silver platter, too.
We were both right.

648
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,167
And to mark the occasion,
Your Highness, look.

649
00:39:37,334 --> 00:39:39,753
I found your old Troll bib.

650
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,463
Wow! I bet you still fit.

651
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,677
Like a glove!

652
00:39:50,681 --> 00:39:51,849
You think that's funny?

653
00:39:52,016 --> 00:39:54,685
We'll see who's laughing
when I bite your yummy head off.

654
00:39:54,852 --> 00:39:56,979
When I bite all y'alls yummy heads off.

655
00:39:58,731 --> 00:39:59,565
Wait a minute.

656
00:39:59,732 --> 00:40:03,319
Chef, this isn't enough yummy heads
to feed all of Bergen Town.

657
00:40:04,153 --> 00:40:07,448
How are we supposed to have Trollstice
if there's not enough Trolls?

658
00:40:07,615 --> 00:40:09,658
There's plenty more
where that came from, sire.

659
00:40:09,825 --> 00:40:11,118
Are you sure?

660
00:40:11,285 --> 00:40:13,621
- Because I promised everyone a Troll.
- No, no, no, sire!

661
00:40:13,787 --> 00:40:15,164
Everything will be fine.

662
00:40:15,331 --> 00:40:16,874
If I were truly worried...

663
00:40:17,041 --> 00:40:19,126
would I be willing to do this?

664
00:40:19,293 --> 00:40:20,336
Creek!

665
00:40:23,923 --> 00:40:25,174
My first Troll!

666
00:40:25,341 --> 00:40:27,509
Go on, eat, King Gristle.

667
00:40:27,676 --> 00:40:30,638
Enjoy a taste of true happiness.

668
00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:38,812
Shouldn't we wait for Trollstice?

669
00:40:40,064 --> 00:40:43,359
Sire, every day is Trollstice
when you have Trolls.

670
00:40:47,613 --> 00:40:49,031
Yeah, I guess.

671
00:40:52,201 --> 00:40:54,370
But my dad said
the first time should be special.

672
00:40:56,956 --> 00:40:58,582
Well, you're the king now.

673
00:40:58,749 --> 00:41:00,668
Yeah, I am the king.

674
00:41:03,545 --> 00:41:06,674
But I think I should share this moment
with all the kingdom.

675
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,800
Eat it!

676
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,844
0h' my GOdl
- No! '

677
00:41:11,011 --> 00:41:11,971
Yes!

678
00:41:18,185 --> 00:41:22,731
Idget, lock these Trolls in your room
and guard them with your life.

679
00:41:24,274 --> 00:41:25,275
Yes, Chef.

680
00:41:26,318 --> 00:41:27,528
Yes. Yes, I know.

681
00:41:27,695 --> 00:41:28,821
Branch, we have to save him!

682
00:41:28,988 --> 00:41:30,698
Save him from what? His stomach?

683
00:41:30,864 --> 00:41:32,282
We didn't see him chew.
We didn't see him swallow!

684
00:41:32,449 --> 00:41:34,910
Face it, Poppy. Sometimes people
go into other people's mouths...

685
00:41:35,077 --> 00:41:36,036
and they don't come out.

686
00:41:36,203 --> 00:41:38,998
If we go after Creek now,
we're going to get eaten.

687
00:41:39,456 --> 00:41:40,582
I'm sorry...

688
00:41:40,749 --> 00:41:42,167
but it's too late for him.

689
00:41:50,092 --> 00:41:50,926
Poppy!

690
00:42:19,163 --> 00:42:21,123
Scullery maid!

691
00:42:23,917 --> 00:42:26,587
Wash these pots and pans for Trollstice.

692
00:42:26,754 --> 00:42:28,589
The king's inviting everyone.

693
00:42:28,756 --> 00:42:30,132
Except you.

694
00:42:51,779 --> 00:42:57,034
<i>I've been alone with you inside my mind</i>

695
00:42:59,578 --> 00:43:03,207
<i>And in my dreams I've kissed your lips</i>

696
00:43:03,999 --> 00:43:06,710
<i>A thousand times</i>

697
00:43:07,503 --> 00:43:13,008
<i>I sometimes see you pass outside my door</i>

698
00:43:15,177 --> 00:43:16,261
<i>Hello</i>

699
00:43:18,597 --> 00:43:22,518
<i>Is it me you're looking for?</i>

700
00:43:23,227 --> 00:43:26,605
<i>I can see it in your eyes</i>

701
00:43:26,772 --> 00:43:29,942
<i>I can see it in your smile</i>

702
00:43:31,276 --> 00:43:33,946
<i>You're all I've ever wanted</i>

703
00:43:34,863 --> 00:43:38,575
<i>And my arms are open wide</i>

704
00:43:38,742 --> 00:43:40,536
<i>'Cause you know just what to say</i>

705
00:43:40,702 --> 00:43:42,746
You're all the idiots!
I have to do everything myself.

706
00:43:42,955 --> 00:43:44,790
<i>And you know just what to do</i>

707
00:43:44,957 --> 00:43:47,042
I have to get out of bed, I'm supposed to put
my own clothes on, tie my own shoes.

708
00:43:47,209 --> 00:43:50,462
<i>And I want to tell you so much</i>

709
00:43:52,297 --> 00:43:54,049
<i>I love you</i>

710
00:44:07,062 --> 00:44:08,647
She's in love with the king.

711
00:44:08,814 --> 00:44:11,650
What are you talking about?
Bergens don't have feelings.

712
00:44:11,817 --> 00:44:13,819
Maybe you don't know everything
about the Bergens.

713
00:44:13,986 --> 00:44:15,404
Now let's go.

714
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:23,662
- Guys!
- Poppy!

715
00:44:23,829 --> 00:44:27,082
<i>Celebrate good times, come on</i>

716
00:44:27,249 --> 00:44:29,334
<i>It's a celebration</i>

717
00:44:31,253 --> 00:44:33,755
<i>There's a party going on right here</i>

718
00:44:33,922 --> 00:44:36,758
No! There is not a party
going on right here.

719
00:44:39,261 --> 00:44:40,929
The sooner we get you guys out of here...

720
00:44:41,096 --> 00:44:42,598
The sooner we can save Creek!

721
00:44:42,764 --> 00:44:43,599
What?

722
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:45,475
Hello?

723
00:44:47,144 --> 00:44:49,188
Is it me you're looking for?

724
00:44:51,356 --> 00:44:53,483
I know you're looking for the cupcakes
and rainbows here...

725
00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:55,194
but let's face it, Creek's been eaten.

726
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,695
They put him in a taco!

727
00:44:56,862 --> 00:44:58,155
It was horrible.

728
00:44:58,322 --> 00:45:00,157
Sorry, Poppy. Creek's gone.

729
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:05,454
Poppy, how could you possibly
think Creek's still alive?

730
00:45:05,621 --> 00:45:09,666
I don't think he's alive.
I hope he's alive, and that's enough.

731
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:12,169
How do you always look
on the bright side?

732
00:45:12,336 --> 00:45:14,004
There is no bright side here. None!

733
00:45:14,171 --> 00:45:15,547
There's always a bright side.

734
00:45:15,714 --> 00:45:17,841
Hey! Where do you think you're going?

735
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:23,972
Glitter! No! Get back in your cage!

736
00:45:26,642 --> 00:45:28,560
Chef's gonna be so mad!

737
00:45:29,353 --> 00:45:30,145
No!

738
00:45:32,981 --> 00:45:34,566
Bridget, stop!

739
00:45:35,567 --> 00:45:37,319
You're in love with King Gristle.

740
00:45:38,654 --> 00:45:40,405
I don't know what you're talking about.

741
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:45,494
Excuse me!

742
00:45:46,161 --> 00:45:47,704
That's not mine.

743
00:45:52,542 --> 00:45:54,002
What does it matter?

744
00:45:54,169 --> 00:45:56,421
It's not like he even knows I'm alive.

745
00:45:56,588 --> 00:45:58,924
Bridget, I can help you!

746
00:45:59,091 --> 00:46:01,677
What if there was a way
we could both get what we want?

747
00:46:02,219 --> 00:46:03,845
You love Gristle, too?

748
00:46:04,012 --> 00:46:07,015
You'd better back off, girlfriend!

749
00:46:09,768 --> 00:46:11,353
No. Bridget, no.

750
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:15,315
That Troll King Gristle put in his mouth,
that's Creek.

751
00:46:15,482 --> 00:46:17,818
And I would do anything to save him.

752
00:46:18,485 --> 00:46:19,736
<i>The only problem is...</i>

753
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:22,489
<i>we can't get anywhere near the king
without him eating us.</i>

754
00:46:27,035 --> 00:46:27,869
But...

755
00:46:28,078 --> 00:46:29,454
you can.

756
00:46:29,913 --> 00:46:32,916
You can walk right up to him
and tell him how you feel.

757
00:46:33,583 --> 00:46:34,626
As if.

758
00:46:34,793 --> 00:46:36,878
I can't just walk right up to the king.

759
00:46:37,045 --> 00:46:41,383
His Royal Awesomeness would never
talk to a scullery maid like me.

760
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:43,885
What if he didn't know
you were a scullery maid?

761
00:46:44,052 --> 00:46:46,471
What if he thought
you were this total babe?

762
00:46:46,972 --> 00:46:50,559
What kind of total babe
would be dressed like a scullery maid?

763
00:46:50,726 --> 00:46:51,810
I smell like gravy.

764
00:46:51,977 --> 00:46:54,563
- What if we made you a new outfit?
- I'm thinking...

765
00:46:54,730 --> 00:46:55,731
Jumpsuit!

766
00:46:55,897 --> 00:46:58,817
What's the point of a jumping suit
if I still have this hair?

767
00:46:58,984 --> 00:46:59,985
We can fix that.

768
00:47:00,152 --> 00:47:02,612
What's the point of a new outfit
and new hair...

769
00:47:02,779 --> 00:47:05,324
if I don't even know what a total babe
would ever say?

770
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:06,616
We can help with that too!

771
00:47:06,992 --> 00:47:07,909
Really?

772
00:47:08,076 --> 00:47:09,161
What do you say, Bridget?

773
00:47:09,328 --> 00:47:12,914
You get us Creek,
and we'll get you a date with the king.

774
00:47:17,169 --> 00:47:18,128
Let's do it?

775
00:47:18,295 --> 00:47:19,838
A 5, 6, 7, 8...

776
00:47:20,005 --> 00:47:22,591
<i>When you look in the mirror
Let it disappear</i>

777
00:47:22,758 --> 00:47:24,926
<i>All your insecurities</i>

778
00:47:25,093 --> 00:47:25,802
Wait!

779
00:47:26,261 --> 00:47:27,804
Why isn't this one singing?

780
00:47:28,138 --> 00:47:29,181
Come on, Branch.

781
00:47:29,348 --> 00:47:30,474
Sing with us!

782
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,601
Yeah, Branch, sing with us!

783
00:47:32,768 --> 00:47:33,810
No. That's okay.

784
00:47:33,977 --> 00:47:35,604
You don't think this will work?

785
00:47:35,812 --> 00:47:37,773
No, no. It's not that. I just don't sing.

786
00:47:37,939 --> 00:47:39,441
- Branch!
- No.

787
00:47:39,608 --> 00:47:41,860
He's right. This idea is stupid.

788
00:47:42,027 --> 00:47:44,279
King Gristle will never love me.

789
00:47:44,821 --> 00:47:46,823
Come on. Hey, hey.
What's all this?

790
00:47:48,033 --> 00:47:50,285
That's right, Bridget.
Just let it all out.

791
00:47:50,452 --> 00:47:52,871
Bridget, let it go.
Just have a good cry.

792
00:47:53,038 --> 00:47:53,955
Go, girl!

793
00:47:55,791 --> 00:47:57,667
Okay, now bring it back in.

794
00:47:57,834 --> 00:47:58,835
Reel it in.

795
00:48:00,337 --> 00:48:01,838
Branch, what are you doing?

796
00:48:02,005 --> 00:48:04,508
- You have to sing!
- I told you, I don't sing.

797
00:48:04,674 --> 00:48:06,676
- You have to!
- I'm sorry. I can't.

798
00:48:06,843 --> 00:48:08,678
- No, you can. You just won't.
- Fine. I just won't.

799
00:48:08,845 --> 00:48:09,846
- You have to!
- No!

800
00:48:10,013 --> 00:48:10,847
'Yes!
“No!

801
00:48:11,014 --> 00:48:12,474
Why not? Why won't you sing?

802
00:48:12,641 --> 00:48:14,476
Because singing killed my grandma, okay?

803
00:48:16,144 --> 00:48:18,063
Now, leave me alone.

804
00:48:21,149 --> 00:48:24,194
My uncle broke his neck
tap dancing once.

805
00:48:28,573 --> 00:48:31,827
How did singing kill your grandma?

806
00:48:33,328 --> 00:48:34,746
What song was she singing?

807
00:48:35,914 --> 00:48:37,499
I was the one singing.

808
00:48:39,501 --> 00:48:43,004
<i>And I need you now tonight</i>

809
00:48:43,171 --> 00:48:46,425
<i>And I need you more than ever</i>

810
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:50,178
<i>That day, I was so lost in song...</i>

811
00:48:50,345 --> 00:48:52,347
<i>I didn't hear my grandma
trying to warn me.</i>

812
00:48:52,514 --> 00:48:54,015
Branch! Watch out!

813
00:48:54,182 --> 00:48:57,519
<i>And we'll only be making it right</i>

814
00:48:57,686 --> 00:48:59,521
Watch out, Branch!

815
00:49:08,405 --> 00:49:10,365
Grandma!

816
00:49:19,624 --> 00:49:23,044
<i>Once upon a time
there was light in his life</i>

817
00:49:23,211 --> 00:49:26,631
<i>But now there's only love in the dark</i>

818
00:49:26,798 --> 00:49:28,800
<i>Nothing he can say</i>

819
00:49:29,134 --> 00:49:34,139
<i>A total eclipse of the heart</i>

820
00:49:37,309 --> 00:49:39,227
I haven't sung a note since.

821
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:44,232
I'm so sorry, Branch. I had no idea.

822
00:49:44,399 --> 00:49:47,235
I just assumed you had a terrible voice.

823
00:49:47,402 --> 00:49:51,072
No, no, it was like an angel's.

824
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:54,451
At least, that's what Grandma used to say.

825
00:49:59,915 --> 00:50:02,959
Whoa, whoa.
What are you doing? It's not hug time.

826
00:50:03,126 --> 00:50:05,587
I just thought you could use one.

827
00:50:13,512 --> 00:50:15,931
Okay. Okay, I'll help.

828
00:50:16,097 --> 00:50:18,183
But I'm still not singing.

829
00:50:18,808 --> 00:50:21,937
Okay, people. Hair we go!

830
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:27,108
<i>You</i>

831
00:50:28,527 --> 00:50:32,489
<i>You gotta let it show</i>

832
00:50:34,991 --> 00:50:36,284
<i>I'm comin'</i>

833
00:50:36,451 --> 00:50:39,287
<i>I'm comin'</i>

834
00:50:39,454 --> 00:50:40,330
<i>All right</i>

835
00:50:40,497 --> 00:50:41,289
<i>Out</i>

836
00:50:43,458 --> 00:50:45,001
<i>I'm comin'</i>

837
00:50:45,168 --> 00:50:48,129
<i>I'm comin'</i>

838
00:50:49,047 --> 00:50:50,298
<i>Out</i>

839
00:50:51,883 --> 00:50:52,801
<i>I'm comin'</i>

840
00:50:52,968 --> 00:50:55,512
<i>Yo! I'm coming out
like the sun after rain</i>

841
00:50:55,679 --> 00:50:57,847
<i>Ready to shine no time to be playin'
Feelin' good</i>

842
00:50:58,014 --> 00:51:00,850
<i>Gonna get get what I, what I want
Gonna show every-everybody</i>

843
00:51:01,017 --> 00:51:02,018
<i>How I, how I flaunt</i>

844
00:51:02,185 --> 00:51:04,479
<i>Look at me now, my confidence is soaring</i>

845
00:51:04,646 --> 00:51:06,314
<i>Dudes be impressed
with the points I'm scoring like</i>

846
00:51:06,481 --> 00:51:07,482
<i>That ain't boring</i>

847
00:51:07,649 --> 00:51:09,150
<i>And it just don't quit
Watch the king drop his jaw</i>

848
00:51:09,317 --> 00:51:10,569
<i>When I'm shaking my hips
I'm saying</i>

849
00:51:10,735 --> 00:51:11,861
<i>She's coming out</i>

850
00:51:12,028 --> 00:51:13,029
<i>She's comin'</i>

851
00:51:13,196 --> 00:51:14,990
<i>It's time to take a stand</i>

852
00:51:15,156 --> 00:51:20,078
<i>- And show the world that I'm comin' out
- She's comin' out</i>

853
00:51:24,833 --> 00:51:26,918
No, no, no! It's all wrong!

854
00:51:27,252 --> 00:51:28,920
I'm the king who's
bringing back Trollstice.

855
00:51:29,087 --> 00:51:30,547
I need a bib to match.

856
00:51:30,714 --> 00:51:31,673
Yes, sire.

857
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:33,341
- I look like a child in this one.
- Oh, sire!

858
00:51:33,508 --> 00:51:35,427
I need something elegant, sophisticated.

859
00:51:35,677 --> 00:51:37,846
You know, a man's bib.

860
00:51:38,013 --> 00:51:39,764
Oh, he's so beautiful.

861
00:51:39,931 --> 00:51:41,516
And so are you.

862
00:51:42,058 --> 00:51:44,227
- He'll know that I'm just a scullery maid.
- No, no, no!

863
00:51:44,394 --> 00:51:45,770
I got to get out of here.

864
00:51:45,937 --> 00:51:48,940
I'll be right here for you, Bridget.
We all will.

865
00:51:49,107 --> 00:51:51,693
- You'll tell me what to say, right?
- Of course, I will.

866
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:53,194
Of course, I will.

867
00:51:53,361 --> 00:51:54,696
Just wait until we get inside.

868
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:57,866
Sire! I believe I have the perfect bib!

869
00:51:58,033 --> 00:52:00,702
It better be!
Trollstice is tomorrow night.

870
00:52:00,869 --> 00:52:03,413
I mean, I look good.
But I have to look great.

871
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:04,623
Right.

872
00:52:06,374 --> 00:52:08,209
It's got a wing-dingle on it!

873
00:52:08,627 --> 00:52:11,129
Your Majesty! Look at you!
Such a big, big boy.

874
00:52:11,296 --> 00:52:12,589
I love it!

875
00:52:13,381 --> 00:52:15,550
I think you look fat.

876
00:52:15,717 --> 00:52:17,093
What?

877
00:52:18,053 --> 00:52:20,221
P-H, phat. Then strike that pose.

878
00:52:20,388 --> 00:52:21,890
P-h, Phat!

879
00:52:23,725 --> 00:52:25,602
Hot lunch!

880
00:52:25,769 --> 00:52:28,980
Total honesty from a total babe.

881
00:52:30,815 --> 00:52:32,651
And who might you be?

882
00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:35,320
Your name is...

883
00:52:36,071 --> 00:52:37,072
- Lady!
- Glitter?

884
00:52:37,238 --> 00:52:38,740
- Sparkles!
- Seriously?

885
00:52:38,907 --> 00:52:41,910
My name is Lady Glittersparkles,
seriously.

886
00:52:42,494 --> 00:52:44,788
Well, my lady Glittersparkles.

887
00:52:45,497 --> 00:52:47,457
Would you care to join me
for an evening...

888
00:52:47,624 --> 00:52:50,126
at Captain Starfunkle's
Roller Rink and Arcade?

889
00:52:50,293 --> 00:52:51,586
Would I!

890
00:52:51,753 --> 00:52:52,629
Would I?

891
00:52:52,796 --> 00:52:54,422
Yes! You'd be delighted.

892
00:52:54,589 --> 00:52:56,591
Yes! You'd be delighted.

893
00:52:57,342 --> 00:52:58,760
Indeed, I would.

894
00:52:58,927 --> 00:53:00,762
When are you gonna ask him about Creek?

895
00:53:00,929 --> 00:53:03,765
We have to warm him up first.
Don't you know anything about romance?

896
00:53:03,932 --> 00:53:05,934
Of course! I'm passionate about it.

897
00:53:06,101 --> 00:53:06,851
Really?

898
00:53:07,018 --> 00:53:08,770
Don't you know anything about sarcasm?

899
00:53:08,937 --> 00:53:11,147
I think I had a sarcasm once.

900
00:53:11,314 --> 00:53:13,358
And I'll take one of everything, Bibbly.

901
00:53:13,525 --> 00:53:16,486
Things are gonna get messy.

902
00:53:18,113 --> 00:53:21,282
Enjoy your pizza.
Here's your tokens.

903
00:53:24,119 --> 00:53:26,246
So fancy.

904
00:53:26,413 --> 00:53:29,082
Good thing I brought my appetite.

905
00:53:42,971 --> 00:53:44,639
You are fantastic!

906
00:53:45,306 --> 00:53:47,267
Bridget! Compliment him back!

907
00:53:47,434 --> 00:53:48,601
I like your back.

908
00:53:48,768 --> 00:53:51,104
No! I meant say something nice about him.

909
00:53:51,271 --> 00:53:52,647
But I do like his back.

910
00:53:55,108 --> 00:53:56,818
POPPY, help her.

911
00:53:57,610 --> 00:53:58,319
Your eyes...

912
00:53:59,779 --> 00:54:00,530
They're...

913
00:54:01,322 --> 00:54:02,157
Ooh!

914
00:54:02,323 --> 00:54:03,825
Your ears...

915
00:54:03,992 --> 00:54:05,118
Your eyes...

916
00:54:05,285 --> 00:54:06,661
-ears...
- Nose!

917
00:54:06,828 --> 00:54:07,662
- Skin!
- Neck!

918
00:54:07,829 --> 00:54:08,997
Skin, neck, ears...

919
00:54:09,164 --> 00:54:10,623
-nose, face, back of your head.
- Are you okay?

920
00:54:10,790 --> 00:54:12,041
<i>Your teeth</i>

921
00:54:12,208 --> 00:54:13,376
Teeth.

922
00:54:13,543 --> 00:54:15,628
What's going on?
Are you making fun of me?

923
00:54:15,795 --> 00:54:16,880
Your eyes!

924
00:54:18,006 --> 00:54:18,965
They're like...

925
00:54:19,132 --> 00:54:21,301
two pools, so deep...

926
00:54:21,634 --> 00:54:25,013
I fear if I dive in...

927
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:27,515
I might never come up for air.

928
00:54:28,224 --> 00:54:30,477
I might never come up for air.

929
00:54:32,228 --> 00:54:33,855
And your smile...

930
00:54:34,022 --> 00:54:36,024
The sun itself turns jealous...

931
00:54:36,191 --> 00:54:38,818
and refuses to come out
from behind the clouds...

932
00:54:38,985 --> 00:54:42,405
Knowing it cannot shine half as bright.

933
00:54:42,572 --> 00:54:45,867
I kinda do have a nice smile, don't I?

934
00:54:46,367 --> 00:54:48,411
Yes, you do.

935
00:54:52,081 --> 00:54:54,417
I can't believe I'm about to say this...

936
00:54:54,584 --> 00:54:56,002
GUYS, She's going rogue!

937
00:54:56,169 --> 00:54:59,005
But being here with you today...

938
00:54:59,172 --> 00:55:03,176
makes me realize
that true happiness is possible.

939
00:55:04,385 --> 00:55:05,678
Whoa.

940
00:55:05,845 --> 00:55:06,888
It is!

941
00:55:07,055 --> 00:55:10,683
True happiness is a lot closer
than you think.

942
00:55:11,684 --> 00:55:13,728
It's right here.

943
00:55:15,230 --> 00:55:16,731
That's pretty, I guess.

944
00:55:16,898 --> 00:55:18,441
What do you think now?

945
00:55:19,734 --> 00:55:20,401
Creek?

946
00:55:20,568 --> 00:55:22,111
I knew he was alive!

947
00:55:22,403 --> 00:55:23,905
Mr. Dinkles, he's alive!

948
00:55:24,405 --> 00:55:25,907
Oh, snap!

949
00:55:27,909 --> 00:55:29,244
You just talked!

950
00:55:31,371 --> 00:55:33,706
- I've been savoring this little guy.
- Help!

951
00:55:34,541 --> 00:55:35,375
Mercy!

952
00:55:35,542 --> 00:55:38,795
Tell me, my lady, will I be seeing you
at the Trollstice feast?

953
00:55:38,962 --> 00:55:41,464
Well, duh. I'll be working.

954
00:55:41,881 --> 00:55:42,757
It!

955
00:55:42,924 --> 00:55:45,426
It. Working it. You know...

956
00:55:45,844 --> 00:55:47,428
workin' it.

957
00:55:48,221 --> 00:55:49,931
Yeah! You're not kidding, you will.

958
00:55:50,098 --> 00:55:52,141
Because you're gonna be there
as my plus one.

959
00:55:52,308 --> 00:55:54,435
A -Really?

960
00:55:54,602 --> 00:55:55,895
'Yes!
'Yes!

961
00:55:56,062 --> 00:55:56,813
Yes!

962
00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:59,941
Meantimes, maybe we should find
some other way to...

963
00:56:00,108 --> 00:56:01,609
work up an appetite.

964
00:56:01,776 --> 00:56:04,779
Oh, yeah? What did you have in mind?

965
00:56:09,993 --> 00:56:10,994
Whoo!

966
00:56:22,505 --> 00:56:23,506
Whoo!

967
00:56:23,798 --> 00:56:24,799
Whoo!

968
00:56:56,873 --> 00:56:58,333
Your Majesty.

969
00:57:00,209 --> 00:57:01,961
You seem to be having...

970
00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:04,047
fun.

971
00:57:04,213 --> 00:57:05,131
I am!

972
00:57:05,298 --> 00:57:08,343
Meet the lovely Lady Glittersparkles.

973
00:57:12,513 --> 00:57:15,516
You remind me of someone.

974
00:57:18,061 --> 00:57:20,980
She's gonna be my plus one.

975
00:57:21,147 --> 00:57:22,482
Oh, I see.

976
00:57:22,649 --> 00:57:26,986
For a moment there I was concerned
you were changing the plan.

977
00:57:30,031 --> 00:57:32,325
Well, this won't be a problem at all,
Your Highness.

978
00:57:32,492 --> 00:57:34,661
I'll just get my worthless
scullery maid to get...

979
00:57:34,827 --> 00:57:36,704
another place setting ready
for the lovely...

980
00:57:36,871 --> 00:57:40,041
Lady Glittersparkles.

981
00:57:40,208 --> 00:57:41,709
Put her place setting next to mine.

982
00:57:41,876 --> 00:57:44,170
I want her right by my side...

983
00:57:44,337 --> 00:57:46,881
Hey! Lady Glittersparkles?

984
00:57:47,715 --> 00:57:49,384
Lady Glittersparkles!

985
00:57:51,511 --> 00:57:53,596
I'll see you at Trollstice, yeah?

986
00:58:01,229 --> 00:58:03,189
I miss you already.

987
00:58:03,773 --> 00:58:04,607
Ow!

988
00:58:10,238 --> 00:58:11,906
I think the king really likes us.

989
00:58:12,073 --> 00:58:13,408
I know, right?

990
00:58:13,574 --> 00:58:15,868
That was the greatest day of my life!

991
00:58:16,452 --> 00:58:17,453
Thanks, Poppy.

992
00:58:18,579 --> 00:58:20,123
Thanks to all of you!

993
00:58:20,289 --> 00:58:21,582
Even you, I guess.

994
00:58:22,917 --> 00:58:25,044
I just never thought something like that
could happen to me.

995
00:58:25,211 --> 00:58:26,796
And it just did!

996
00:58:26,963 --> 00:58:29,257
I'm so excited I could just scream.

997
00:58:32,301 --> 00:58:34,929
I could scream too! Creek is alive!

998
00:58:44,105 --> 00:58:45,273
Branch, what's wrong?

999
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:47,608
Nothing. I thought we were celebrating.

1000
00:58:47,775 --> 00:58:49,110
That's your happy shout?

1001
00:58:49,277 --> 00:58:50,653
It's been a while.

1002
00:58:50,987 --> 00:58:53,948
Well, you're gonna have plenty of practice,
because we're gonna save Creek...

1003
00:58:54,115 --> 00:58:56,409
and life will be all
cupcakes and rainbows again.

1004
00:58:56,576 --> 00:58:57,577
Up top!

1005
00:58:57,744 --> 00:58:58,786
Too slow.

1006
00:58:58,953 --> 00:59:00,288
- Yes!
- I knew it!

1007
00:59:00,455 --> 00:59:01,456
Okay, everybody...

1008
00:59:01,622 --> 00:59:04,125
let's go save Creek.

1009
00:59:04,625 --> 00:59:06,169
No! No! You can't leave.

1010
00:59:06,335 --> 00:59:09,172
Lady Glittersparkles is gonna be
the king's plus one at dinner.

1011
00:59:09,338 --> 00:59:10,631
The dinner where they're serving Troll?

1012
00:59:10,798 --> 00:59:12,759
Yeah, I think we're gonna
have to skip that one.

1013
00:59:12,925 --> 00:59:15,678
No! No, you have to help me
be Lady Glittersparkles.

1014
00:59:15,845 --> 00:59:16,804
I need you.

1015
00:59:16,971 --> 00:59:19,307
You don't wanna pretend to be
someone you're not forever!

1016
00:59:19,474 --> 00:59:21,517
Then how about just for tomorrow?

1017
00:59:21,684 --> 00:59:23,186
Bridget, you don't need us anymore.

1018
00:59:23,352 --> 00:59:25,646
You and the king
can make each other happy!

1019
00:59:25,813 --> 00:59:28,983
That's impossible!
Only eating a Troll can make you happy.

1020
00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:30,777
Everyone knows that!

1021
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:33,488
I wish I'd never
gone on this stupid date!

1022
00:59:35,823 --> 00:59:36,699
Bfldgetu

1023
00:59:36,866 --> 00:59:40,286
Just go! Get out of my room.
Leave me alone.

1024
00:59:40,453 --> 00:59:41,287
Please, listen.

1025
00:59:41,454 --> 00:59:42,830
Bridget!

1026
00:59:42,997 --> 00:59:44,165
- We've gotta go.
- Bridget...

1027
00:59:44,332 --> 00:59:45,833
What's going on down there?

1028
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,669
Bridget, scrub that dish!

1029
00:59:48,836 --> 00:59:51,506
The king's bringing a plus one.

1030
00:59:51,672 --> 00:59:52,673
Yes, Chef.

1031
01:00:01,349 --> 01:00:03,142
We can do this, Barnabus.

1032
01:00:03,309 --> 01:00:06,854
I just have to lose 30 pounds
in the next eight hours.

1033
01:00:24,372 --> 01:00:25,581
There it is!

1034
01:00:28,751 --> 01:00:30,753
<i>I feel good
I feel good</i>

1035
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:32,380
<i>I feel good
I feel good</i>

1036
01:00:32,547 --> 01:00:35,591
<i>I feel good</i>

1037
01:00:36,384 --> 01:00:38,219
Creek, we'll have you
out of there in a second.

1038
01:00:38,386 --> 01:00:40,179
- Hurry!
- It's stuck!

1039
01:00:42,056 --> 01:00:42,890
Run!

1040
01:00:46,561 --> 01:00:50,857
<i>I feel love</i>

1041
01:00:54,110 --> 01:00:56,237
Hey, guys! Over here!

1042
01:00:57,613 --> 01:00:58,614
- Everyone, get in!
- Let's go.

1043
01:00:58,781 --> 01:00:59,907
- Branch, give him to me.
- Go!

1044
01:01:00,074 --> 01:01:01,576
Just g0!

1045
01:01:01,993 --> 01:01:03,077
Everybody hold on!

1046
01:01:06,747 --> 01:01:08,583
Hold it steady, guys.

1047
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:12,712
Satin, Chenille, sharp right!

1048
01:01:12,879 --> 01:01:13,796
Let's do it!

1049
01:01:18,593 --> 01:01:20,052
Guy Diamond, glitter him!

1050
01:01:20,219 --> 01:01:22,096
Eat glitter!

1051
01:01:26,392 --> 01:01:27,560
Look!

1052
01:01:28,686 --> 01:01:29,437
Hold on!

1053
01:01:33,733 --> 01:01:34,859
Creek!

1054
01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:44,118
Branch!

1055
01:01:48,122 --> 01:01:49,081
We 9011 you!

1056
01:02:01,969 --> 01:02:03,095
Gotcha!

1057
01:02:08,643 --> 01:02:09,977
No!

1058
01:02:10,144 --> 01:02:12,063
He can't be gone.

1059
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:14,482
I'm sorry, Poppy. We're too late.

1060
01:02:14,649 --> 01:02:15,483
Actually...

1061
01:02:15,650 --> 01:02:18,569
your timing is perfect.

1062
01:02:23,658 --> 01:02:27,620
Sorry, but I can't have you leaving
before tomorrow's dinner.

1063
01:02:27,787 --> 01:02:29,830
A dinner to which you are all invited.

1064
01:02:30,331 --> 01:02:31,666
And when I say all...

1065
01:02:31,832 --> 01:02:34,835
I mean every Troll in Troll Village.

1066
01:02:35,002 --> 01:02:37,338
You'll never find them.
Not where they're hiding.

1067
01:02:38,839 --> 01:02:41,509
You're right. I couldn't find them.

1068
01:02:41,676 --> 01:02:44,470
But I could with someone they know.

1069
01:02:45,012 --> 01:02:46,806
Someone they trust.

1070
01:02:48,349 --> 01:02:49,350
Someone...

1071
01:02:50,476 --> 01:02:51,811
like this guy.

1072
01:02:51,978 --> 01:02:53,938
Creek! You're alive!

1073
01:02:54,105 --> 01:02:55,147
He's so cool.

1074
01:02:55,314 --> 01:02:56,315
Yes!

1075
01:02:57,817 --> 01:02:59,443
He's selling us out!

1076
01:02:59,610 --> 01:03:00,695
Branch! Wait!

1077
01:03:00,861 --> 01:03:04,365
I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation.
At least give him a chance.

1078
01:03:04,657 --> 01:03:06,033
Thank you, POPPY-

1079
01:03:06,867 --> 01:03:08,452
I'm selling you out.

1080
01:03:10,705 --> 01:03:12,373
No, stop! No, wait!

1081
01:03:14,875 --> 01:03:16,877
You better explain yourself, Creek!

1082
01:03:17,795 --> 01:03:20,381
As I was about to accept my fate...

1083
01:03:20,548 --> 01:03:23,384
I had, what I can only describe as...

1084
01:03:23,551 --> 01:03:26,053
a spiritual awakening.

1085
01:03:26,554 --> 01:03:27,722
I don't wanna die!

1086
01:03:28,347 --> 01:03:29,473
Don't eat me.

1087
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:33,394
Eat someone else. Anyone else.
Everyone else. But not me!

1088
01:03:33,561 --> 01:03:35,730
But the king wants to be happy now.

1089
01:03:35,896 --> 01:03:38,983
Wait! Wait! There must be some other way.

1090
01:03:39,150 --> 01:03:41,569
<i>I'll</i> do anything.

1091
01:03:45,406 --> 01:03:49,410
No! Creek, please don't do this.

1092
01:03:49,577 --> 01:03:50,661
Believe me...

1093
01:03:50,828 --> 01:03:55,374
I wish there was some other
me-not-getting-eaten way.

1094
01:03:55,541 --> 01:03:57,251
But there isn't.

1095
01:03:57,835 --> 01:04:01,255
And now I have to live with this
for the rest of my life.

1096
01:04:01,422 --> 01:04:04,592
At least you get to die
with a clear conscience.

1097
01:04:05,176 --> 01:04:06,761
So, in a way...

1098
01:04:07,428 --> 01:04:09,263
you could say...

1099
01:04:09,430 --> 01:04:11,265
I'm doing this for you.

1100
01:04:15,686 --> 01:04:16,771
<i>Boom!</i>

1101
01:04:24,612 --> 01:04:28,282
Listen. It's Poppy's cowbell!

1102
01:04:28,532 --> 01:04:30,242
My baby did it!

1103
01:04:30,409 --> 01:04:32,119
Poppy did it!

1104
01:04:35,414 --> 01:04:36,707
Creek?

1105
01:04:43,631 --> 01:04:44,799
Uh-oh.

1106
01:04:52,306 --> 01:04:55,309
Trollstice! Trollstice! Trollstice!

1107
01:05:06,737 --> 01:05:08,823
Now let's prepare the main course.

1108
01:05:10,324 --> 01:05:12,576
The Trolls!

1109
01:05:22,795 --> 01:05:24,505
Poppy?

1110
01:05:25,005 --> 01:05:28,801
Poppy! Thank goodness you're all right.

1111
01:05:28,968 --> 01:05:30,761
I'm doing great.

1112
01:05:30,928 --> 01:05:34,348
I got everybody I love thrown in a pot.
Thanks for asking.

1113
01:05:36,851 --> 01:05:39,270
PQPDV? Are you being...

1114
01:05:40,271 --> 01:05:41,981
sarcastic?

1115
01:05:42,356 --> 01:05:43,441
Yes!

1116
01:05:44,483 --> 01:05:45,693
Oh, my God!

1117
01:05:46,277 --> 01:05:47,820
I'm sorry.

1118
01:05:47,987 --> 01:05:50,114
I don't know why
I thought I could save you.

1119
01:05:53,033 --> 01:05:57,037
All I wanted to do was keep everyone safe,
like you did, Dad.

1120
01:05:57,204 --> 01:05:58,789
But I couldn't.

1121
01:05:59,415 --> 01:06:00,708
Poppy-

1122
01:06:03,043 --> 01:06:05,379
I let everyone down.

1123
01:06:09,675 --> 01:06:11,302
But, Poppy...

1124
01:06:11,927 --> 01:06:13,762
You were right, Branch.

1125
01:06:14,388 --> 01:06:17,224
The world isn't all cupcakes and rainbows.

1126
01:06:29,612 --> 01:06:30,821
Poppy-

1127
01:08:07,084 --> 01:08:10,754
<i>You with the sad eyes</i>

1128
01:08:19,888 --> 01:08:23,267
<i>Don't be discouraged</i>

1129
01:08:40,784 --> 01:08:43,495
<i>Oh, I realize</i>

1130
01:08:44,830 --> 01:08:47,583
<i>It's hard to take courage</i>

1131
01:08:48,459 --> 01:08:51,670
<i>In a world full of people</i>

1132
01:08:51,837 --> 01:08:54,923
<i>You can lose sight of it all</i>

1133
01:08:55,090 --> 01:08:57,343
<i>The darkness inside you</i>

1134
01:08:57,509 --> 01:09:01,055
<i>Can make you feel so small</i>

1135
01:09:26,955 --> 01:09:28,874
What are you doing? The king is waiting.

1136
01:09:29,041 --> 01:09:30,084
Get those Trolls out there!

1137
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:31,251
Sorry, Chef.

1138
01:09:31,418 --> 01:09:32,753
Oh, you are sorry.

1139
01:09:40,302 --> 01:09:44,890
<i>Show me a smile then</i>

1140
01:09:45,057 --> 01:09:49,937
<i>Don't be unhappy, can't remember when</i>

1141
01:09:51,772 --> 01:09:54,775
<i>I last saw you laughing</i>

1142
01:09:54,942 --> 01:09:57,778
<i>This world makes you crazy</i>

1143
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:01,448
<i>And you've taken all you can bear</i>

1144
01:10:01,615 --> 01:10:04,284
<i>Just call me up</i>

1145
01:10:04,451 --> 01:10:07,371
<i>'Cause I will always be there</i>

1146
01:10:07,538 --> 01:10:11,542
<i>And I see your true colors</i>

1147
01:10:11,709 --> 01:10:14,461
<i>Shining through</i>

1148
01:10:14,628 --> 01:10:18,674
<i>I see your true colors</i>

1149
01:10:18,841 --> 01:10:23,053
<i>And that's why I love you</i>

1150
01:10:26,974 --> 01:10:30,144
<i>So don't be afraid</i>

1151
01:10:30,310 --> 01:10:33,147
<i>To let them show</i>

1152
01:10:33,313 --> 01:10:36,817
<i>Your true colors</i>

1153
01:10:36,984 --> 01:10:42,030
<i>True colors are beautiful</i>

1154
01:10:45,743 --> 01:10:49,413
<i>I see your true colors</i>

1155
01:10:49,580 --> 01:10:51,665
<i>- Shining through
- True colors</i>

1156
01:10:51,999 --> 01:10:56,336
<i>I see your true colors</i>

1157
01:10:56,503 --> 01:10:59,339
<i>That's why I love you</i>

1158
01:10:59,506 --> 01:11:02,176
<i>So don't be afraid</i>

1159
01:11:02,342 --> 01:11:05,512
<i>To let them show</i>

1160
01:11:05,679 --> 01:11:09,183
<i>Your true colors</i>

1161
01:11:09,349 --> 01:11:12,186
<i>True colors</i>

1162
01:11:12,352 --> 01:11:16,940
<i>Are beautiful</i>

1163
01:11:18,358 --> 01:11:22,362
<i>Like a rainbow</i>

1164
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:29,244
<i>Like a rainbow</i>

1165
01:11:50,808 --> 01:11:51,892
Thank you!

1166
01:11:52,392 --> 01:11:54,478
No. Thank you.

1167
01:11:54,645 --> 01:11:55,729
For what?

1168
01:11:55,896 --> 01:11:58,607
For showing me how to be happy.

1169
01:11:58,774 --> 01:12:01,401
Really? You're finally happy?

1170
01:12:02,069 --> 01:12:02,986
Now?

1171
01:12:03,278 --> 01:12:05,072
I think so.

1172
01:12:05,239 --> 01:12:07,783
Happiness is inside of all of us, right?

1173
01:12:07,950 --> 01:12:11,078
Sometimes, you just need someone
to help you find it.

1174
01:12:13,539 --> 01:12:16,458
What's gonna happen now, Princess Poppy?

1175
01:12:16,625 --> 01:12:17,709
I don't know.

1176
01:12:18,085 --> 01:12:20,921
But I know we're not giving up.

1177
01:12:27,094 --> 01:12:27,886
No.

1178
01:12:28,053 --> 01:12:29,888
This is it, Mr. Dinkles. This is it.

1179
01:12:37,312 --> 01:12:38,230
Poppy!

1180
01:12:38,397 --> 01:12:39,314
Bridget?

1181
01:12:39,481 --> 01:12:40,774
Trolls! Trolls! Trolls!

1182
01:12:40,941 --> 01:12:42,609
What are you doing?

1183
01:12:42,776 --> 01:12:43,944
I can't let them eat you.

1184
01:12:44,111 --> 01:12:45,237
- But...
- Come on!

1185
01:12:45,404 --> 01:12:46,655
You gotta go!

1186
01:12:46,822 --> 01:12:48,949
Hurry! Go, go, go!
Get out of here!

1187
01:12:49,116 --> 01:12:52,286
No! Bridget, if you go in there without us,
you know what they'll do.

1188
01:12:52,452 --> 01:12:53,453
I know.

1189
01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:54,580
But, Bridget...

1190
01:12:54,913 --> 01:12:55,831
It's okay.

1191
01:12:57,457 --> 01:12:59,126
It's okay, POPPY-

1192
01:13:00,627 --> 01:13:03,505
You showed me what it feels like
to be happy.

1193
01:13:04,506 --> 01:13:07,843
I never would have known
if it wasn't for you.

1194
01:13:09,761 --> 01:13:12,306
And I love you for that.

1195
01:13:12,973 --> 01:13:14,641
I love you too, Bridget.

1196
01:13:15,809 --> 01:13:17,144
Bridget!

1197
01:13:19,438 --> 01:13:21,481
Go on, now. You have to hurry!

1198
01:13:21,648 --> 01:13:22,608
Come with us.

1199
01:13:22,774 --> 01:13:24,443
And make it easier for them to find you?

1200
01:13:24,610 --> 01:13:26,987
No way! You have to go. Now!

1201
01:13:27,154 --> 01:13:28,322
Bridget!

1202
01:13:43,629 --> 01:13:45,005
Bye, POPPY-

1203
01:13:50,677 --> 01:13:54,473
Trolls! Trolls! Trolls!

1204
01:13:59,811 --> 01:14:00,687
Wait!

1205
01:14:00,854 --> 01:14:04,149
Chef, shouldn't we
wait for Lady Glittersparkles?

1206
01:14:06,026 --> 01:14:07,319
You are absolutely right.

1207
01:14:07,486 --> 01:14:10,364
Now, everyone, there will be
no Trolls until...

1208
01:14:10,530 --> 01:14:12,699
the king's plus one has arrived.

1209
01:14:12,866 --> 01:14:14,201
Boo!

1210
01:14:14,826 --> 01:14:16,703
We've waited long enough!

1211
01:14:16,870 --> 01:14:17,913
Unless...

1212
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:19,331
Unless, what?

1213
01:14:19,498 --> 01:14:22,209
Well, unless she doesn't come at all.

1214
01:14:22,376 --> 01:14:25,921
But that's crazy talk.
Who wouldn't wanna be with you?

1215
01:14:32,886 --> 01:14:33,887
Yeah.

1216
01:14:34,721 --> 01:14:35,889
Maybe we should start.

1217
01:14:36,056 --> 01:14:37,933
Trolls! Trolls! Trolls!

1218
01:14:38,183 --> 01:14:39,685
Trolls! Trolls! Trolls!

1219
01:14:41,395 --> 01:14:44,398
Trolls! Trolls! Trolls! Yeah!

1220
01:14:44,564 --> 01:14:46,525
Go! Come on. Hurry!

1221
01:14:46,858 --> 01:14:47,901
Come on. Everybody, let's go.

1222
01:14:48,068 --> 01:14:49,861
No Troll left behind!

1223
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:51,905
Watch your step.

1224
01:14:59,663 --> 01:15:00,872
Poppy?

1225
01:15:03,083 --> 01:15:06,044
Bridgetjust ruined her life to save ours.
It's not right!

1226
01:15:06,211 --> 01:15:08,714
She deserves to be happy
as much as we do.

1227
01:15:10,590 --> 01:15:12,092
They all do!

1228
01:15:13,927 --> 01:15:18,432
All right, everybody.
Who's ready to eat Trolls?

1229
01:15:19,266 --> 01:15:20,600
King Gristle...

1230
01:15:20,767 --> 01:15:23,729
there is only one thing
that will ever make you happy...

1231
01:15:23,895 --> 01:15:26,732
and only one Bergen who can provide it.

1232
01:15:27,607 --> 01:15:29,109
<i>Bon appétit!</i>

1233
01:15:31,028 --> 01:15:31,945
They're gone!

1234
01:15:32,112 --> 01:15:33,113
Gone?

1235
01:15:33,405 --> 01:15:34,364
They're gone?

1236
01:15:34,531 --> 01:15:35,365
Idget“

1237
01:15:35,532 --> 01:15:36,616
what did you do?

1238
01:15:36,783 --> 01:15:37,951
You ate them!

1239
01:15:38,285 --> 01:15:40,787
You greedy, greedy pig.

1240
01:15:40,954 --> 01:15:42,080
No! I...

1241
01:15:42,247 --> 01:15:43,290
She ruined Trollstice!

1242
01:15:44,374 --> 01:15:46,376
Guards, lock her up!

1243
01:15:48,754 --> 01:15:50,213
Let's get her!

1244
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,418
Lady Glittersparkles?

1245
01:16:30,003 --> 01:16:30,921
What?

1246
01:16:34,299 --> 01:16:36,134
But how? Why?

1247
01:16:36,301 --> 01:16:37,761
Why did you do this?

1248
01:16:38,345 --> 01:16:41,515
Because she didn't think you would
want someone like her.

1249
01:16:41,681 --> 01:16:43,141
I mean, hello?

1250
01:16:43,308 --> 01:16:45,519
Is it me you're looking for?

1251
01:16:45,685 --> 01:16:47,687
I don't think so.

1252
01:16:48,772 --> 01:16:50,816
Guards, finish her!

1253
01:16:51,983 --> 01:16:52,859
No.

1254
01:16:53,693 --> 01:16:54,528
Wait!

1255
01:16:54,694 --> 01:16:58,365
King Gristle, when you were with Bridget,
you were feeling something, weren't you?

1256
01:16:58,532 --> 01:17:01,493
Yeah, I was.
I just thought it was too much pizza.

1257
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:02,828
Me, too.

1258
01:17:02,994 --> 01:17:06,289
That feeling? That was happiness.

1259
01:17:06,456 --> 01:17:07,374
What?

1260
01:17:07,541 --> 01:17:10,043
But you have to eat a Troll to be happy.

1261
01:17:10,210 --> 01:17:11,795
Everyone knows that!

1262
01:17:11,962 --> 01:17:12,796
Don't you?

1263
01:17:12,963 --> 01:17:16,049
But King Gristle's never eaten
a Troll in his life, right?

1264
01:17:16,216 --> 01:17:18,009
No, I haven't.

1265
01:17:18,385 --> 01:17:20,470
Yet, here I am.

1266
01:17:21,304 --> 01:17:22,806
My belly empty...

1267
01:17:23,473 --> 01:17:25,475
and my heart full.

1268
01:17:28,395 --> 01:17:29,396
Don't listen to her!

1269
01:17:29,813 --> 01:17:31,565
There's only one way to be happy.

1270
01:17:31,731 --> 01:17:32,816
My Way!

1271
01:17:32,983 --> 01:17:33,733
No!

1272
01:17:33,900 --> 01:17:35,068
With me in charge...

1273
01:17:36,153 --> 01:17:39,322
I'll serve you Troll
every day of the year.

1274
01:17:40,490 --> 01:17:42,409
With me as queen...

1275
01:17:42,576 --> 01:17:45,745
all of life will be a never-ending
feast of happiness!

1276
01:17:46,580 --> 01:17:47,747
Come on, eat!

1277
01:17:47,914 --> 01:17:49,082
Eat!

1278
01:17:51,251 --> 01:17:52,085
No!

1279
01:17:54,004 --> 01:17:56,423
Happiness isn't something
you put inside.

1280
01:17:56,590 --> 01:17:58,341
It's already there.

1281
01:17:58,508 --> 01:18:02,053
Sometimes you just need someone
to help you find it.

1282
01:18:02,220 --> 01:18:03,513
Can I really be happy?

1283
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:05,432
- I want to be happy!
- And me!

1284
01:18:05,599 --> 01:18:06,683
And what about me?

1285
01:18:08,602 --> 01:18:10,437
Do you really think I can be happy?

1286
01:18:10,812 --> 01:18:11,605
Of course!

1287
01:18:11,771 --> 01:18:14,441
It's inside you!
It's inside of all of us!

1288
01:18:14,608 --> 01:18:16,526
And I don't think it.

1289
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:18,320
I feel it!

1290
01:18:19,321 --> 01:18:23,325
<i>I got this feeling inside my bones</i>

1291
01:18:23,491 --> 01:18:27,037
<i>It goes electric wavy when I turn it on</i>

1292
01:18:28,413 --> 01:18:31,499
<i>And if you want it inside your soul</i>

1293
01:18:32,083 --> 01:18:35,629
<i>Just open up your heart
Let music take control</i>

1294
01:18:35,795 --> 01:18:38,506
<i>I've got that sunshine in my pocket</i>

1295
01:18:38,673 --> 01:18:41,134
<i>Got that good soul in my feet</i>

1296
01:18:41,301 --> 01:18:44,262
<i>I feel that hot blood in my body
When it drops</i>

1297
01:18:45,096 --> 01:18:49,351
<i>I can't take my eyes up off it
Moving so phenomenally</i>

1298
01:18:49,517 --> 01:18:51,186
<i>The room on lock
The way we rock it</i>

1299
01:18:51,353 --> 01:18:52,896
<i>So don't stop</i>

1300
01:18:53,063 --> 01:18:57,317
<i>Under the lights, when everything goes</i>

1301
01:18:57,484 --> 01:19:00,528
<i>Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close</i>

1302
01:19:00,695 --> 01:19:01,696
<i>Can't stop, won't stop</i>

1303
01:19:01,863 --> 01:19:04,991
<i>When we move well you already know</i>

1304
01:19:05,158 --> 01:19:06,284
<i>Let's go, let's work</i>

1305
01:19:06,451 --> 01:19:10,664
<i>So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine</i>

1306
01:19:11,164 --> 01:19:14,834
<i>Nothing I can see but you
when you dance, dance, dance</i>

1307
01:19:15,001 --> 01:19:19,089
<i>Feel the good-good creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on</i>

1308
01:19:19,631 --> 01:19:23,593
<i>All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance</i>

1309
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:27,597
<i>And ain't nobody leaving soon
So keep dancing</i>

1310
01:19:27,764 --> 01:19:29,391
<i>I can't stop the feeling</i>

1311
01:19:29,891 --> 01:19:31,518
<i>So just dance, dance, dance</i>

1312
01:19:31,685 --> 01:19:33,937
<i>I can't stop the feeling</i>

1313
01:19:34,104 --> 01:19:35,689
<i>So just dance, dance, dance</i>

1314
01:19:35,855 --> 01:19:38,108
<i>I can't stop the feeling</i>

1315
01:19:38,275 --> 01:19:39,776
<i>So just dance, dance, dance</i>

1316
01:19:39,943 --> 01:19:41,319
<i>I can't stop the feeling</i>

1317
01:19:42,362 --> 01:19:44,948
<i>So keep dancing, come on</i>

1318
01:19:51,538 --> 01:19:53,707
<i>Yeah
I can't stop the...</i>

1319
01:19:55,458 --> 01:19:56,584
My eyes!

1320
01:19:56,751 --> 01:19:57,502
Let's do it!

1321
01:19:57,669 --> 01:19:58,628
<i>I can't stop the</i>

1322
01:20:01,256 --> 01:20:02,966
<i>I can't stop the</i>

1323
01:20:05,927 --> 01:20:07,721
<i>I can't stop the</i>

1324
01:20:09,889 --> 01:20:10,890
<i>I can't stop the
I can't stop the</i>

1325
01:20:11,850 --> 01:20:13,351
<i>I can't stop the feeling</i>

1326
01:20:13,518 --> 01:20:15,729
<i>Nothing I can see but you
when you dance, dance, dance</i>

1327
01:20:16,229 --> 01:20:17,230
<i>I can't stop the feeling</i>

1328
01:20:17,397 --> 01:20:20,191
<i>Feel the good creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance</i>

1329
01:20:20,358 --> 01:20:21,568
<i>I can't stop the feeling</i>

1330
01:20:21,735 --> 01:20:24,487
<i>All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance</i>

1331
01:20:24,654 --> 01:20:25,697
<i>I can't stop the feeling</i>

1332
01:20:25,864 --> 01:20:29,034
<i>And ain't nobody leaving soon
So keep dancing</i>

1333
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:30,410
<i>I can't stop the feeling</i>

1334
01:20:30,577 --> 01:20:32,954
<i>Got this feeling in my body</i>

1335
01:20:33,121 --> 01:20:34,414
<i>I can't stop the feeling</i>

1336
01:20:34,581 --> 01:20:37,375
<i>Got this feeling in my body</i>

1337
01:20:37,542 --> 01:20:38,918
<i>I can't stop the feeling</i>

1338
01:20:39,085 --> 01:20:41,379
<i>Wanna see you move your body</i>

1339
01:20:41,546 --> 01:20:42,630
<i>I can't stop the feeling</i>

1340
01:20:43,131 --> 01:20:46,217
<i>Got this feeling in my body, come on</i>

1341
01:20:46,926 --> 01:20:49,888
Our new queen!

1342
01:20:54,309 --> 01:20:55,810
430, Queen Poppy!
- Way to go, Poppy!

1343
01:20:55,977 --> 01:20:57,312
You did it!

1344
01:20:57,854 --> 01:20:59,356
Alright, Queen Poppy!

1345
01:20:59,522 --> 01:21:01,107
She's my friend! I know her!

1346
01:21:01,274 --> 01:21:02,859
<i>So just dance, dance, dance</i>

1347
01:21:03,026 --> 01:21:04,569
<i>I can't stop the feeling</i>

1348
01:21:05,570 --> 01:21:07,447
<i>So just dance, dance, dance</i>

1349
01:21:07,614 --> 01:21:09,824
<i>I can't stop the feeling</i>

1350
01:21:09,991 --> 01:21:12,452
<i>So keep dancing, come on</i>

1351
01:21:13,078 --> 01:21:17,123
I know it's not officially hug time yet,
but...

1352
01:21:17,665 --> 01:21:22,045
Now that I am queen,
I decree that hug time is all the time.

1353
01:21:24,297 --> 01:21:25,715
<i>I can't stop the</i>

1354
01:21:28,468 --> 01:21:29,469
<i>I can't stop the</i>

1355
01:21:29,636 --> 01:21:30,637
Up high!

1356
01:21:32,430 --> 01:21:33,181
<i>I can't stop the feeling</i>

1357
01:21:33,473 --> 01:21:34,391
Yeah! Yeah!

1358
01:21:34,557 --> 01:21:36,559
<i>Got this feeling in my body</i>

1359
01:21:36,726 --> 01:21:38,019
<i>I can't stop the feeling</i>

1360
01:21:38,186 --> 01:21:42,273
<i>Got this feeling in my body, come on</i>

1361
01:21:52,117 --> 01:21:54,035
<i>Do you remember</i>

1362
01:21:54,411 --> 01:21:57,247
<i>The 21st night of September</i>

1363
01:21:57,914 --> 01:22:01,376
<i>Love was changing the minds of pretenders</i>

1364
01:22:01,918 --> 01:22:05,672
<i>While chasing the clouds away</i>

1365
01:22:07,173 --> 01:22:09,217
<i>Our hearts were ringing</i>

1366
01:22:09,384 --> 01:22:12,470
<i>In the key that our souls were singing</i>

1367
01:22:13,096 --> 01:22:14,889
<i>As we danced in the night</i>

1368
01:22:15,140 --> 01:22:20,562
<i>Remember how the stars stole the night away</i>

1369
01:22:53,470 --> 01:22:57,056
<i>The bell was ringing, oh</i>

1370
01:22:57,557 --> 01:23:00,935
<i>And our souls were singing</i>

1371
01:23:01,102 --> 01:23:06,816
<i>Do you remember
Never was a cloudy day, oh</i>

1372
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:39,349
<i>Break it down for me</i>

1373
01:23:40,475 --> 01:23:42,769
<i>Say do you remember</i>

1374
01:23:43,645 --> 01:23:46,898
<i>Ooh dancing in September</i>

1375
01:23:56,824 --> 01:23:58,618
<i>Do you remember</i>

1376
01:24:00,286 --> 01:24:02,872
<i>Dancing in September</i>

1377
01:24:03,039 --> 01:24:07,377
<i>And it never was a cloudy day</i>

1378
01:24:12,382 --> 01:24:13,508
<i>Come on</i>

1379
01:24:15,426 --> 01:24:18,179
<i>We're dancing in September</i>

1380
01:24:34,237 --> 01:24:35,947
But wait, wait, wait.
