1
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:49,381
Today is best day ever.

2
00:00:50,132 --> 00:00:51,550
Moving Day!

3
00:00:52,134 --> 00:00:53,260
For who?

4
00:00:53,427 --> 00:00:55,804
Answer: The Boov.

5
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:57,139
Who are the Boov?

6
00:00:57,306 --> 00:01:01,476
Answer: Best species ever at running away.

7
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:04,938
All Boov settlers, please report
to your assigned transport.

8
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:06,398
You are allowed one carry-on.

9
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,401
Excusing me. Sorries.

10
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,820
Excusing me.
Pardon the me, friend.

11
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:12,488
Boov do not friend.

12
00:01:13,072 --> 00:01:13,614
Owpain!

13
00:01:13,781 --> 00:01:14,782
Uh-oh. Sorries.

14
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:17,618
Who am I?
I am Oh.

15
00:01:17,785 --> 00:01:20,954
I has been given this name
by my many, many friends.

16
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:23,457
- Good morning!
- Oh.

17
00:01:23,624 --> 00:01:24,750
- Hi, guys.
- Oh.

18
00:01:24,917 --> 00:01:25,917
- Hello.
- Oh.

19
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:33,843
I am very excitement
to make a new fresh start!

20
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:38,305
We are all moving to best planet ever
for to hiding.

21
00:01:38,764 --> 00:01:40,599
Our new home!

22
00:01:52,361 --> 00:01:54,196
Captain Smek!

23
00:01:56,198 --> 00:01:58,867
My fellow Boov!

24
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:00,786
I has saved us again.

25
00:02:02,371 --> 00:02:03,371
A bit lower.

26
00:02:03,497 --> 00:02:04,539
No, stop!

27
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:05,708
Up a bit. Up a bit.

28
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:08,127
Perfect. Walk away. Walk away.

29
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,545
My fellow...

30
00:02:10,546 --> 00:02:11,547
My...

31
00:02:12,381 --> 00:02:13,382
fellow...

32
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:16,177
Boov.

33
00:02:18,804 --> 00:02:19,805
Good news!

34
00:02:20,556 --> 00:02:22,558
Thanks to my leadership skills...

35
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:25,561
cowering, running
and pulling a skedaddle...

36
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:27,396
we are safe from our enemy...

37
00:02:27,563 --> 00:02:28,897
the Gorg.

38
00:02:32,693 --> 00:02:33,819
Nasty.

39
00:02:37,573 --> 00:02:40,158
Give Daddy some sugar!

40
00:02:40,576 --> 00:02:42,828
Captain Smek has saved us again!

41
00:02:42,995 --> 00:02:47,495
We are now arrived at the best
hiding place yet in the Milky Way.

42
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:50,419
And the Gorg are lactose intolerant.

43
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:52,254
Genius!

44
00:02:52,421 --> 00:02:54,756
They will never find us here.

45
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:56,258
Thank you!

46
00:02:57,593 --> 00:02:58,760
Best of yet...

47
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:01,263
this planet is full of great stuff.

48
00:03:02,431 --> 00:03:05,100
Look at these delicious fruits!

49
00:03:08,562 --> 00:03:10,522
That makes me feel so good.

50
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:13,358
What fun at a party!

51
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:14,944
Boov do not party.

52
00:03:15,277 --> 00:03:17,362
Also, this planet is inhabited.

53
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,697
But do not worry.

54
00:03:18,864 --> 00:03:22,284
The native savages are
simple and backwards.

55
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:28,081
They are so ugly, they are cute!

56
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:32,044
Everything you need to know about them
can be found...

57
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:34,213
in these comprehensive pamphlets.

58
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,799
Comprehensive pamphlet.
Comprehensive pamphlet.

59
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:39,301
They are lucky the Boov have come.

60
00:03:39,468 --> 00:03:42,137
All right, Boov. Invade on three.

61
00:03:42,304 --> 00:03:43,388
One, two, three.

62
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:54,650
Rejoice, humanspeople!
The Boov are arrived!

63
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:57,444
Now we are turning off
your gravity temporarily...

64
00:03:57,611 --> 00:04:01,072
so as to make your mandatory
relocation easier.

65
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,741
And more fun!

66
00:04:02,908 --> 00:04:04,618
So, what is up?

67
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:06,203
You are!

68
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:22,553
You'll never catch me!

69
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,891
Enjoy you the frozen, sweetened
bovine secretion...

70
00:04:28,058 --> 00:04:31,061
as we take this short flight
to Happy Humanstown.

71
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:50,247
This is so cool! Come on!

72
00:04:53,834 --> 00:04:54,918
Fa-da!

73
00:04:55,085 --> 00:04:59,585
Humanspersons are happiness and joy forever
in Happy Humanstown.

74
00:05:00,549 --> 00:05:01,967
Welcome to your new home.

75
00:05:02,134 --> 00:05:04,052
- Wait, what? No!
- New home?

76
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,805
And rest of planet is for Boov.

77
00:05:06,972 --> 00:05:08,139
Win-win!

78
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:14,563
Welcome, Boov settlers.

79
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,815
All humans have been relocated.

80
00:05:16,982 --> 00:05:18,608
Your homes are now ready.

81
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:20,110
Thanking you!

82
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,700
This planet may be
a bit of a fixing-it-upper...

83
00:05:26,867 --> 00:05:28,118
but that is okay.

84
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:31,830
Boov are best at deciding what is useful.

85
00:05:31,997 --> 00:05:33,248
And what is not.

86
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:35,667
Owpain.

87
00:05:36,001 --> 00:05:38,003
Step aside. Clean-up crew.

88
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,296
Useless.

89
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,599
Today, I starts a new life.

90
00:05:50,766 --> 00:05:53,977
With new friends. In a new home.

91
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:58,440
Residents may now enter sector 179.

92
00:05:58,607 --> 00:05:59,608
That is me!

93
00:05:59,775 --> 00:06:04,154
And that is why today is best day ever!

94
00:06:24,174 --> 00:06:26,342
Welcome home, neighbors!

95
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,470
Boov do not have "neighbors."

96
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:32,724
That is owing to the size
and topography of our former planet.

97
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:37,145
Hey! Can I borrowing a cup of sugar?

98
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,524
What?

99
00:06:41,108 --> 00:06:44,945
But now, our closer proximity
can leads to friendship.

100
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:46,947
You are all invited...

101
00:06:47,114 --> 00:06:49,241
to my warming of house party.

102
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:52,494
Say, 5200?

103
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:53,913
Sure.

104
00:06:54,663 --> 00:06:55,663
Yes!

105
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:03,023
Hey, Pig! Be careful up there!

106
00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:05,149
I'm sorry, Pig.

107
00:08:05,484 --> 00:08:06,776
Mom's not here.

108
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:08,070
It's just a video.

109
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:10,948
Hey, Mom.
I think Pig wants to join us.

110
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,075
It's not funny!

111
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:14,784
Tip!

112
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,786
Come on, Mom. It's just snow.

113
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:18,413
I don't know anything about snow.

114
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:21,082
We're from Barbados!
We don't have snow!

115
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:24,961
Are you okay?

116
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:27,755
I 'm sending this to everyone.

117
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:46,358
Sector 195 is ready for occupation.

118
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,279
We can't wait for Mom, Pig.
We gotta go.

119
00:08:50,946 --> 00:08:51,946
Right now!

120
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:22,810
Oh, no!

121
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,237
Prepare for your dance attack!

122
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:55,010
Okay, let's go find Mom.

123
00:10:28,627 --> 00:10:30,045
Neighbors, hello!

124
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:33,965
Please come in and...

125
00:10:38,178 --> 00:10:39,846
Hello.

126
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:44,392
Hello?

127
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,973
And right. And left. Other left.

128
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,224
Kyle!

129
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:26,976
Right. No, left.

130
00:11:27,102 --> 00:11:28,812
Hello, friend Kyle.

131
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,273
I am not your friend.

132
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,484
Of course you are.
We have had many enjoyable talks.

133
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:37,821
No, we talk only because
I'm not allowed to move.

134
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:40,323
You are always saying the funny things.

135
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:44,285
Perhaps you can say them
at my warming of house party tonight.

136
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:48,707
I will not. Parties are useless
and take up valuable Boov time.

137
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,626
Since you are at your busyness,
I shall send an e-vite to you...

138
00:11:51,793 --> 00:11:54,003
so you can join later
during your leisure minute.

139
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:56,298
Please do not send.
I enjoy my leisure minute.

140
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:59,468
Fa-da! I have sent directions
to my living space.

141
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:03,180
Fa-da! I have sent directions
to my living space.

142
00:12:04,848 --> 00:12:07,725
You sent directions to everyone?

143
00:12:08,143 --> 00:12:10,186
What?
It is not my fault.

144
00:12:10,812 --> 00:12:14,273
Whyfor put "send" button
right next to "send all"?

145
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:15,942
This is just bad design.

146
00:12:16,109 --> 00:12:20,154
Your invite has been sent
to entire galaxy!

147
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:21,656
Uh-oh.

148
00:12:21,698 --> 00:12:23,408
"Uh-oh" is right!

149
00:12:23,575 --> 00:12:26,035
Our enemy, the Gorg, will receive it...

150
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:28,788
and can use directions for to find us!

151
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:30,248
The Gorg?

152
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:39,215
Fa-da!

153
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:43,803
You have doomed our species!

154
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:45,764
No, please.

155
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,099
I did not mean to. I am sorries!

156
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,810
You are arresting!

157
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,144
No!

158
00:12:51,311 --> 00:12:52,979
I was just trying to invite you to my...

159
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:57,984
Security has been compromised.

160
00:12:58,151 --> 00:12:59,861
Arrest that Boov!

161
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:03,365
Autopilot, I needs help!

162
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:06,868
Help is available in Paris
at Boov Headquarters.

163
00:13:07,035 --> 00:13:09,370
No, Autopilot!
Any place but Paris!

164
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:11,873
You must takes me to a place
with no Boovs.

165
00:13:12,207 --> 00:13:15,877
The only remaining spot on planet
with no Boov is Antarctica.

166
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:18,963
Group hug!

167
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,885
Yes! Antarctica is perfect!
Take me there now!

168
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,847
I am sorry. You are fugitive Boov.

169
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,516
Initiating Self-Destruct.

170
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,351
No! Do not initiate!

171
00:13:31,518 --> 00:13:32,810
I am not a fugitive!

172
00:13:48,243 --> 00:13:49,243
No!

173
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,684
Oh, no.

174
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,513
Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha!

175
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,266
Whatfor are you did this?

176
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:38,520
I am Boov, beloved by all humans.

177
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,188
I know what you are.

178
00:15:40,355 --> 00:15:42,857
Excellent! Can I come into the out now?

179
00:15:43,024 --> 00:15:45,443
No, you cannot "come into the out" now.

180
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:47,987
You can never come into the out,
ever again!

181
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:50,156
But I can!

182
00:15:50,323 --> 00:15:53,200
You are just having
to take away the piece of wood.

183
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,872
Then I will have to...

184
00:15:57,038 --> 00:16:01,208
I will shoot forth the lasers
from my eyeballs!

185
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,628
You can do that?

186
00:16:04,963 --> 00:16:06,506
Yes.

187
00:16:09,968 --> 00:16:13,721
If you shoot your eye lasers,
then I'll have no choice...

188
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,390
but to explode your head!

189
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:18,309
- You humans cannot to explode...
- We can too!

190
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,811
We just don't much.

191
00:16:19,978 --> 00:16:21,187
It's considered rude.

192
00:16:23,398 --> 00:16:25,316
Then I am granting you a truce.

193
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,486
You are not to exploding heads...

194
00:16:27,652 --> 00:16:30,571
and I will not do my
devastating eye lasers.

195
00:16:33,658 --> 00:16:35,701
Okay. Truce.

196
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:37,579
- So, can I come into the out now?
- No!

197
00:16:37,996 --> 00:16:41,666
This is what you get
for stealing planets and abducting people.

198
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,417
You are thinking a mistake.

199
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:45,878
Boov do not steal and abduct.

200
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:48,882
No, Boov liberate and befriend.

201
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,427
Guess who made this one!

202
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:55,346
This is so beautiful!

203
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,184
Mom! What's happening?

204
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:00,435
I don't know, honey.

205
00:17:03,104 --> 00:17:04,104
Tip!

206
00:17:05,106 --> 00:17:06,440
It will be okay.

207
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:12,739
Lifeform detected. Not human.
Move along.

208
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:15,617
Enjoy you the frozen, sweetened
bovine secretion...

209
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:18,119
as we take this short flight
to Happy Humanstown.

210
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:19,954
Mom!

211
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,418
It's all your fault.

212
00:17:25,585 --> 00:17:27,753
You stole my mom!

213
00:17:28,463 --> 00:17:30,631
Smell ya later, Boov.

214
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,425
Wait! Smell me now!

215
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:35,970
I can to fixing your car.
I seen you has broken it.

216
00:17:36,137 --> 00:17:38,806
I didn't break it.
I'm a very good driver.

217
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:41,434
It's supposed to leak like that.

218
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,784
Can I come into the out now?

219
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:03,832
I know the fugitive Boov has made
yet another in a series of horrible...

220
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:07,168
yet unintentionally humorous mistakes.

221
00:18:07,335 --> 00:18:10,588
But let me reassure you,
the signal he broadcast...

222
00:18:10,755 --> 00:18:11,964
is being handled.

223
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:15,510
We are definitely not doomed.

224
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,805
- And we're out.
- We are doomed!

225
00:18:18,888 --> 00:18:21,140
The Gorg are going to find us again!

226
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:23,518
The maniac Boov has ruined everything.

227
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:25,770
This is bad.

228
00:18:29,357 --> 00:18:31,150
And I really love this planet.

229
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:33,570
Look at all the great stuff they've got.

230
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:36,990
Like this! A headband!

231
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:40,201
And for evening wear, you slide it down...

232
00:18:40,368 --> 00:18:42,078
you got a beautiful spare tire.

233
00:18:42,245 --> 00:18:43,245
I love it!

234
00:18:43,371 --> 00:18:44,538
Very nice!

235
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:47,333
Who would wanna leave this behind?
I have got to fix this.

236
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:48,835
I know!

237
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:51,004
Summon the Big Brain Boovs.

238
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:53,339
The smarty-pants
of all smarty panty Booviness.

239
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:55,425
Gentleboov...

240
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:57,385
I want ideas.

241
00:18:59,804 --> 00:19:02,431
We could create an alternate reality
with no Gorg in it...

242
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,350
then go live there.

243
00:19:04,517 --> 00:19:06,727
Yes! I love it!

244
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,146
How long would that take?

245
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,315
Based on our current technology...

246
00:19:12,233 --> 00:19:13,859
1.7 million years.

247
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:16,779
That's a lot of years, Toni.
Moving on!

248
00:19:16,946 --> 00:19:18,989
- We could lay on the ground...
- Yes!

249
00:19:19,157 --> 00:19:22,326
And make the Gorg think we are dead.

250
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:26,581
Next!

251
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,667
What if we logged into
the fugitive Boov's email...

252
00:19:29,834 --> 00:19:31,126
and cancelled his e-vite...

253
00:19:31,294 --> 00:19:34,755
Shush! Or we could log into
the fugitive Boov's email...

254
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:37,634
and cancel his invitation, and...

255
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:38,885
What was that?

256
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:40,595
So the Gorg never receive it.

257
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,097
So the Gorg never receive it!

258
00:19:43,264 --> 00:19:47,226
Now, type in the password
and cancel that message.

259
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:50,855
It was a good idea of me
to make all passwords "password."

260
00:19:51,022 --> 00:19:52,106
It's so easy to remember.

261
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:57,362
It did not work! His password is unique.

262
00:19:57,987 --> 00:19:58,779
No!

263
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:02,325
Unique?
Boov are not unique!

264
00:20:03,743 --> 00:20:04,994
Fetch me my inhaler.

265
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:12,877
Boy, that works.

266
00:20:13,044 --> 00:20:15,296
His mistaking is leading the Gorg
right to us.

267
00:20:15,463 --> 00:20:16,630
Show me his invite.

268
00:20:18,007 --> 00:20:20,259
You are all invited to a party!

269
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:21,594
Just head to the Milky Way.

270
00:20:21,761 --> 00:20:23,012
Turn right at the Big Dipper.

271
00:20:23,179 --> 00:20:24,471
Third planet from the Sun.

272
00:20:24,639 --> 00:20:26,974
Look for my balloons!
Party!

273
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,769
Come if you like to have fun!

274
00:20:29,936 --> 00:20:31,771
My best friend Kyle will be there!

275
00:20:31,938 --> 00:20:33,648
Kyle, Kyle, Kyle!

276
00:20:34,065 --> 00:20:35,065
Come party!

277
00:20:36,317 --> 00:20:37,359
Kyle!

278
00:20:37,777 --> 00:20:39,570
He is not my friend.

279
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,865
The internet does not lie!

280
00:20:42,031 --> 00:20:43,741
You know him, you can find him.

281
00:20:43,908 --> 00:20:45,409
I am putting you in charge!

282
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:48,217
But, Captain, it is not my job.
I am only a mid-level traffic Boov.

283
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,540
- I admire your cowardice, Officer.
- Thank you.

284
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:55,002
But I want every Boovcop on Planet Smekland
searching this city.

285
00:20:55,211 --> 00:20:56,754
We need his password...

286
00:20:56,921 --> 00:21:00,132
or we will all be destroyed by the Gorg!

287
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,300
Find him!

288
00:21:01,342 --> 00:21:05,471
That Boov has made his final mistake.

289
00:21:05,805 --> 00:21:06,806
Fa-da!

290
00:21:06,973 --> 00:21:08,724
You were supposed to fix it!

291
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:10,018
What is this?

292
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:10,268
I calls it "Slushious."

293
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,270
I calls it "Slushious."

294
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:33,916
"Slushious"?

295
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:35,292
It makes excellent fuel...

296
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,086
and comes in fun-to-say flavors.

297
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:38,504
"Grape Escape."

298
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:39,755
"Tangerine Twist."

299
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:41,174
"Busta Lime"!

300
00:21:42,258 --> 00:21:43,509
Mom's gonna kill me.

301
00:21:43,676 --> 00:21:48,176
Now I am prepared to accept one of your
traditional gestures of human gratitude.

302
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:52,143
Actually, our tradition is to punch you
in the nose. Hold still.

303
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:54,520
No! Your gratitude is implied.

304
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:58,274
You can drives first.

305
00:21:58,441 --> 00:21:59,817
Then I can...

306
00:21:59,984 --> 00:22:01,151
You're not coming.

307
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:03,821
I'm trying to hide from the Boov.
I'm not bringing one with me.

308
00:22:03,988 --> 00:22:05,197
You'll just turn me in.

309
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:07,408
No! I just needs a ride!

310
00:22:07,575 --> 00:22:10,744
I haves official Boov business
out of in town.

311
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:11,912
Me, too.

312
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:14,081
But I fixes your car!

313
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:16,459
So? I let you out of the freezer.
We're even.

314
00:22:30,139 --> 00:22:32,599
- What did you do to my car?
- What doos you mean?

315
00:22:32,767 --> 00:22:34,226
It should to hover much better now.

316
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:37,230
It's a car. It didn't hover at all before.

317
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:39,941
How do you stop this thing?

318
00:22:51,786 --> 00:22:56,286
Oops. I have apparently reversing
the proceed and anti-proceed controls.

319
00:22:56,457 --> 00:22:58,834
Yeah, I noticed.
Stop is go.

320
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:00,795
- Go is stop.
- Wait!

321
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:04,131
Whyfor you do this?
Boovs and humans are friends!

322
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:06,718
We're not friends.
You kidnapped my mom!

323
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:11,973
Who is Mimom?

324
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,224
No, "my" mom!

325
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:14,725
What did I say?

326
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,315
- I knows how to find her.
- How?

327
00:23:21,482 --> 00:23:24,026
That information is at
Boov Central Command.

328
00:23:24,193 --> 00:23:25,861
- At the Great Antenna.
- What?

329
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:28,281
In Paris! Now let me to inside!

330
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:29,574
Paris.

331
00:23:31,242 --> 00:23:32,743
- Then promise.
- What?

332
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:35,496
Promise you'll help me find her
or I'm leaving your Boov butt.

333
00:23:37,498 --> 00:23:41,251
I promise! But if you do not wish
to be capturing, it must be now!

334
00:23:45,673 --> 00:23:47,007
Fine. Get in.

335
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:08,905
Oui, oui, Pig!
Paris, here we come.

336
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:11,741
We're gonna find out
where they put Mom.

337
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:34,050
Okay. I shall set the GPS
to take us straight to the Paris.

338
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:39,227
Destination entered: Antarctica.

339
00:24:39,727 --> 00:24:40,978
Hey, what are you doing?

340
00:24:41,437 --> 00:24:43,105
How did that happen?

341
00:24:43,272 --> 00:24:45,941
Keep your Boov paws off my car!

342
00:24:47,568 --> 00:24:48,610
Whoa!

343
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:52,365
Your vehicle is infested.

344
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:55,451
It's not infested. He's my pet.

345
00:24:55,618 --> 00:24:57,953
His name is Pig. Don't touch him.

346
00:24:58,121 --> 00:24:59,622
Now he is vibrating.

347
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:01,373
Is he going to explode?

348
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:03,543
No! He's just purring.

349
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,002
Why do you haves this thing?

350
00:25:05,169 --> 00:25:08,297
Is it useful? Does it give meat or milk?

351
00:25:08,464 --> 00:25:10,132
What? No!

352
00:25:10,299 --> 00:25:13,635
You just have pets for fun
and companionship.

353
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:16,388
You has me for companion on the ship.

354
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:18,683
Yeah, well, Pig is better.

355
00:25:20,768 --> 00:25:24,313
If cat is "Pig," what is your name?

356
00:25:36,367 --> 00:25:39,161
Gratuity Tucci.
But my friends call me "Tip."

357
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:42,164
- Tip.
- I said "my friends."

358
00:25:42,331 --> 00:25:45,334
But we are friends.
All humans and Boov.

359
00:25:45,501 --> 00:25:47,002
Captain Smek has decided.

360
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,254
Captain Smek is an idiot.

361
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:50,172
Untrue!

362
00:25:50,339 --> 00:25:54,217
Captain Smek is genius
and best at running away.

363
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:58,014
Have you not heard
the legend of the Shusher?

364
00:25:58,931 --> 00:26:02,434
Long ago, our enemy, the Gorg...

365
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:05,271
invited the Boov to a peace meeting.

366
00:26:11,527 --> 00:26:14,488
But Smek wisely fled in terror.

367
00:26:14,655 --> 00:26:17,491
And he took a great trophy: the Shusher.

368
00:26:17,658 --> 00:26:18,867
Run away!

369
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:22,830
Why is it called the "Shusher"?

370
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:24,623
Shush!

371
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:26,834
Whatever.

372
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,833
Seriously?

373
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,720
You guys had to ruin the Statue Of Liberty?

374
00:27:09,877 --> 00:27:10,877
"Statue of Smek."

375
00:27:11,003 --> 00:27:12,838
You will not get away with this.

376
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:14,256
Boov Patrol!

377
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:15,549
They are looking for you!

378
00:27:15,716 --> 00:27:16,716
Oh, no.

379
00:27:32,066 --> 00:27:33,066
Oh, no!

380
00:27:34,735 --> 00:27:35,819
What's that?

381
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:40,700
Hey!

382
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:43,327
Don't distract the driver!

383
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:54,421
Aha! Busta Lime.

384
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:57,300
"Busta Lime."

385
00:28:02,388 --> 00:28:03,555
Owpain!

386
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:04,765
Owpain.

387
00:28:20,531 --> 00:28:21,657
Okay. Pee break.

388
00:28:21,824 --> 00:28:23,200
I, too, has to break pee.

389
00:28:23,367 --> 00:28:24,951
Or, as you calls it, the "number one."

390
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:27,121
- We also has the "number two."
- Okay.

391
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:29,164
- And the "number three."
- Okay!

392
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:31,518
It is a good thing I doos not
have to go the number three.

393
00:28:31,542 --> 00:28:33,168
It would not be safe for you.

394
00:28:34,086 --> 00:28:35,712
We only doos it once a year.

395
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,256
I would not call it a holiday...

396
00:28:37,423 --> 00:28:39,883
- but you doos need to take the day off.
- That's enough!

397
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:44,972
You can't come in here.
This is the girls' room.

398
00:28:54,732 --> 00:28:56,400
Do not eat the blue mints!

399
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:01,739
Thankfully, there is a
large bowl of lemonade.

400
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,452
Do not drink the lemonade!

401
00:29:08,871 --> 00:29:10,247
Be out in a second.

402
00:29:10,414 --> 00:29:12,999
We're going to Paris!

403
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:15,794
Going to see my mom!

404
00:29:18,881 --> 00:29:20,340
Takes your time!

405
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:27,848
Ant-arc-tica.

406
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:30,184
Here I come!

407
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:31,351
Fugitive Boov.

408
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:33,854
Hold still for arresting!

409
00:29:34,021 --> 00:29:35,522
Best friend Kyle!

410
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,024
I am not your friend!

411
00:29:37,191 --> 00:29:39,735
But I will be a hero Boov
for getting your password.

412
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:44,823
Yes! You has in nick-time saved us!

413
00:29:47,326 --> 00:29:48,994
What is the purpose of your face?

414
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:50,454
Owpain.

415
00:29:50,621 --> 00:29:52,039
You were gonna ditch me?

416
00:29:52,206 --> 00:29:53,206
- No!
- Liar!

417
00:29:53,332 --> 00:29:54,708
I never lie!

418
00:29:54,875 --> 00:29:55,875
Yes, you do!

419
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,336
And you know how I know?

420
00:29:57,503 --> 00:30:00,881
Because every time you lie,
you turn green!

421
00:30:01,048 --> 00:30:02,549
I doos not. I...

422
00:30:03,217 --> 00:30:04,217
Poomp.

423
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:11,179
Open the door, you lying,
frog-faced squishy toy!

424
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:13,144
Stop! I need your...

425
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:17,147
You promised to help me find my mom!

426
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:18,816
Then I un-promise!

427
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,526
That's not how it works!

428
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:23,279
You have to help me get to Paris.

429
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:25,281
I will not!

430
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:28,784
Stop! I need your...

431
00:30:33,956 --> 00:30:34,998
I must hide!

432
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:38,127
I am speaking the English at you.
Whyfor do you not understands me?

433
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:41,422
I "understands." I just don't care.

434
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:43,299
- Freezing!
- Look out!

435
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:52,891
Come on!

436
00:30:55,102 --> 00:30:58,688
Stop! I need your password.

437
00:31:01,942 --> 00:31:02,609
No!

438
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:03,777
Go!

439
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:24,673
All I wanted was his password.

440
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:32,222
This is not a sustainable friendship model.

441
00:31:57,873 --> 00:31:59,207
So...

442
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:03,875
I assume by now
we have apprehended the fugitive.

443
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:06,006
Anybody?

444
00:32:06,173 --> 00:32:08,091
You. The purple one.

445
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:12,843
Not that purple. The other purple.
The other purple.

446
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,224
That one.

447
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:16,391
Yes, you!

448
00:32:16,767 --> 00:32:18,351
So, where is he?

449
00:32:18,727 --> 00:32:20,019
We do not know, sir.

450
00:32:20,187 --> 00:32:22,522
What? This is number one disaster!

451
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:25,025
His message must not reach the Gorg.

452
00:32:25,192 --> 00:32:28,737
This planet was hard to find,
and I will not abandon it!

453
00:32:28,904 --> 00:32:32,157
Someone fetch me my stress blankie.

454
00:32:36,787 --> 00:32:38,747
So soothing.

455
00:32:42,042 --> 00:32:43,752
Aha! Officer Kyle!

456
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,880
Now here is a Boov
who knows how to do his job.

457
00:32:47,047 --> 00:32:49,257
Tell me, you have found the fugitive?

458
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:50,592
Yes.

459
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:52,635
Joyful exclamation!

460
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:56,765
And where is he?

461
00:32:58,267 --> 00:33:00,310
There is a tiny problem.

462
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:06,316
"Tiny." As long as it's tiny, who cares?

463
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:09,611
Well, before I got the password...

464
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:12,406
I erased him.

465
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:19,413
Come party. Come party. Come party.

466
00:33:23,667 --> 00:33:25,293
- Quit it!
- Sorry.

467
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:27,588
Look, Paris is danger for both of us.

468
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:29,798
It crawls with Boov.

469
00:33:29,965 --> 00:33:33,009
Doos you have a plan
for once we are get there?

470
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:36,263
Not really. But I have hope.

471
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:38,599
You are bad at math.

472
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:39,516
Excuse me?

473
00:33:39,683 --> 00:33:41,434
I got an "A" in geometry.

474
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:42,936
I am only saying...

475
00:33:43,103 --> 00:33:45,605
Boov are superior in this way.

476
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:49,944
If probability for success
falls below 50%...

477
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:54,156
Boov give up. You do not.

478
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:55,323
Exactly!

479
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,659
Enough with the ripping!

480
00:33:57,826 --> 00:33:59,118
Okay, okay.

481
00:33:59,286 --> 00:34:01,162
Tell you what. Let's have some tuneage.

482
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:10,214
What is that?

483
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:12,132
Boov song.

484
00:34:12,299 --> 00:34:14,301
It is called "Motionless and Obedient."

485
00:34:14,468 --> 00:34:15,302
Very big hit.

486
00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:17,804
No, no, no! Not in my car.

487
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:19,348
Driver gets to pick.

488
00:34:23,185 --> 00:34:25,979
This is not even music.
This is just noise.

489
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:37,991
Involuntary physical response.

490
00:34:38,158 --> 00:34:41,578
You have tricked me into listening
to a debilitating sonic weapon.

491
00:34:41,745 --> 00:34:44,706
If you want humans to not hate you...

492
00:34:44,873 --> 00:34:47,250
you could start by liking
some of our stuff.

493
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:54,883
Confusion. What is happening to my body?

494
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:56,426
It's called dancing!

495
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:58,512
Boov do not dancing!

496
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:01,181
I can tell.
But you're getting the hang of it!

497
00:35:01,348 --> 00:35:03,183
How long before this kills me?

498
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:05,935
I am not in control of my own extremities!

499
00:35:06,103 --> 00:35:08,230
That's it. Work it!

500
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:09,689
I do not want it to work!

501
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:10,857
You know what?

502
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,193
"Boov" rhymes with "groove."

503
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,278
Shake your Boov thang.

504
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:18,031
It is shaking in a most undignified way!

505
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:22,369
Oh, no! My hands are in the air
like I just do not care!

506
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:24,621
This is not how a Boov behaves!

507
00:35:24,788 --> 00:35:26,414
I am overheated with shame!

508
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:28,375
- I must cool my core!
- Wait!

509
00:35:28,542 --> 00:35:30,961
- What are you doing?
- I will returning!

510
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,921
We were having fun!

511
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:34,715
Oh!

512
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:41,430
Oh?

513
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:53,734
Come on, Mom. It's just snow!

514
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:55,819
I don't know anything about snow.

515
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:58,155
Our first snow!

516
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,575
Are you okay?

517
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:03,910
I'm sending this to...

518
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,955
My temperature is back to happiness.

519
00:36:07,122 --> 00:36:10,416
And to show I do not hold against you
any grudge-ment...

520
00:36:10,584 --> 00:36:13,169
I have brought you delicious snacking.

521
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:15,422
Fa-da! Chewy plastic rings!

522
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:20,636
I really do not enjoy
your human gratitude customs.

523
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:21,929
Where have you been?

524
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:23,263
You were gone forever!

525
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:25,098
That is not accurate. "Forever" is...

526
00:36:25,265 --> 00:36:27,475
I thought you were dead! Or hurt!

527
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:29,603
Or I don't know!

528
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:32,522
But you cannot just leave
someone alone like that!

529
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,650
Put yourself in my shoes!

530
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:36,527
How could I wears your shoes?

531
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:37,986
My pods are too small.

532
00:36:38,153 --> 00:36:39,362
It's an expression!

533
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:42,783
It means try to feel how
someone else feels.

534
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:46,870
I'm just a kid. I'm not supposed to be
by myself all the time.

535
00:36:47,037 --> 00:36:50,790
This is child endangerment.
Which is a crime, by the way.

536
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:53,460
But when I founded you,
you were already alone...

537
00:36:53,627 --> 00:36:55,378
so I thinks it is normal for you.

538
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:58,048
When Boov are young,
we are kept in the warming oven.

539
00:37:04,471 --> 00:37:06,806
Is this normal for humanspersons?

540
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:11,474
Usually, we don't cross the Atlantic
by ourselves until we're 16.

541
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:14,314
No, none of this is normal!

542
00:37:14,481 --> 00:37:17,358
Don't you get it? You ruined everything!

543
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:21,738
I was finally happy here...
There, where I lived.

544
00:37:21,905 --> 00:37:23,239
With my mom.

545
00:37:23,657 --> 00:37:26,034
Do you know how hard it was
for me to fit in?

546
00:37:26,201 --> 00:37:27,660
How long that took?

547
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:29,996
7th-grade girls are mean!

548
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:32,332
Yes, I sees that! I did not realize!

549
00:37:32,499 --> 00:37:35,835
We will resume the finding of Mimom.

550
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:37,713
Stop saying that!

551
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,257
She's just "my" mom.

552
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:42,509
Not yours. Mine.

553
00:37:42,676 --> 00:37:45,095
How do you not understand this?

554
00:37:45,262 --> 00:37:48,765
How would you feel if some horrible aliens
took your mother from you?

555
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:51,852
That could not to happen.

556
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:54,021
Boov are not having mimoms.

557
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:57,899
Boov don't have families.

558
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:02,029
No wonder you take things
and don't care about anybody else.

559
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:09,870
So, your mimom...

560
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:12,873
is a very important humansperson to you.

561
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,709
More important than others.

562
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:19,921
To not belong with her
causes you being sad.

563
00:38:23,717 --> 00:38:27,220
But recent moments ago,
you are kicking on me and yelling.

564
00:38:27,387 --> 00:38:31,391
Which is seeming more to be
mad than sad.

565
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:35,604
Well, sometimes it's both.

566
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:40,191
So, you are sad-mad.

567
00:38:52,746 --> 00:38:56,124
Humans are more complicated
than it said in the pamphlet.

568
00:39:03,465 --> 00:39:05,300
I vacuumed here as fast as I could.

569
00:39:06,426 --> 00:39:09,095
Whatfor is your plan for figuring out
the dumb Boov's password?

570
00:39:09,429 --> 00:39:10,596
I got nothing!

571
00:39:11,765 --> 00:39:13,892
Please, come on!
I need ideas!

572
00:39:14,059 --> 00:39:16,061
You! The purple one.

573
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:20,607
Oh, come on!

574
00:39:21,775 --> 00:39:22,776
So?

575
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:27,443
We could type in random
numbers and letters?

576
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:30,117
I like it!

577
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:33,954
Get those big brains
plugged in and working.

578
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:35,288
Away!

579
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:38,667
You know what the Gorg will do
if they find us.

580
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:39,918
Chomp, chomp, chomp.

581
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:46,591
And that is why we keep running away.

582
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:48,134
Whoa.

583
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,178
Why do these Gorg hate you so much?

584
00:39:50,345 --> 00:39:51,596
Because they are Gorg.

585
00:39:51,763 --> 00:39:54,098
We calls Gorg the "takers"...

586
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:57,477
because if you has something,
they takes it.

587
00:39:57,644 --> 00:39:59,437
Like, if you has a sandwich.

588
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:00,772
Or a planet.

589
00:40:00,939 --> 00:40:02,774
No, no. I get it.

590
00:40:02,941 --> 00:40:04,817
But they're not coming
to this planet, right?

591
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:06,528
Oh, no, no. Not to worry.

592
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:09,989
The Big Brain Boov will to fix my mistake.

593
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:11,992
But I will still be very punished.

594
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,785
We has a rule.

595
00:40:13,952 --> 00:40:16,371
Nine mistakes and you are out.

596
00:40:16,538 --> 00:40:18,331
How many mistakes do you have?

597
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:20,292
62.

598
00:40:24,671 --> 00:40:28,132
When I'm stressed out,
my mom tells me jokes.

599
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:31,011
Boov do not do telling jokes.

600
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:32,971
It's not that hard. I'll teach you.

601
00:40:33,138 --> 00:40:34,138
Knock, knock.

602
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:37,350
You would say, "Who's there?"

603
00:40:39,686 --> 00:40:40,853
You are there.

604
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:42,522
No, just ask me.

605
00:40:42,689 --> 00:40:43,523
Who is there?

606
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:46,317
Now I say, "The interrupting cow."

607
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:49,362
Now you say, "The interrupting cow, who?"

608
00:40:49,529 --> 00:40:50,530
Let's just do it.

609
00:40:50,697 --> 00:40:52,990
- Knock, knock.
- Who is there?

610
00:40:53,158 --> 00:40:54,909
The interrupting cow.

611
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:57,496
- The interrupting cow...
- Moo!

612
00:40:57,663 --> 00:40:59,706
You did not let me finish my response.

613
00:40:59,873 --> 00:41:02,876
- I was to say, "The interrupting co..."
- Moo!

614
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:04,586
You did it again.

615
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,548
That is the joke.

616
00:41:08,715 --> 00:41:11,551
The cow is to being an interrupting cow...

617
00:41:11,718 --> 00:41:13,720
and therefore interrupts me!

618
00:41:13,887 --> 00:41:16,180
- I know. That's why it's funny.
- Moo!

619
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:17,932
- Let me fi...
- Moo!

620
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,820
- That's enough.
- I'm the interrupting cow.

621
00:41:19,851 --> 00:41:21,394
- Knock it off!
- Moo!

622
00:41:21,561 --> 00:41:23,604
- Don't make me get out more tape!
- Moo!

623
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:34,449
So many Boovs!

624
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,576
I said this was dumbness.

625
00:41:36,743 --> 00:41:39,370
I said I am doomed.
But doos you listen? No!

626
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:40,538
Oh, that's enough!

627
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:42,415
You are driving me to the crazy!

628
00:41:42,582 --> 00:41:45,793
It is never too late to run away.
That is the Boov motto.

629
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,755
Yes, but we're not doing that.
I have a plan.

630
00:41:48,922 --> 00:41:51,925
Is your plan to run away?
Because other-way-wise, it is stupid!

631
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:53,885
All we have to do
is sneak into the city...

632
00:41:54,052 --> 00:41:56,888
get into the Great Antenna,
use it to find my mom...

633
00:41:57,055 --> 00:41:59,098
and then sneak out again. See?

634
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:02,310
But it still will not work
because my face is known.

635
00:42:02,477 --> 00:42:06,939
If I am seen by any Boov,
I am 100% popular for being arrested.

636
00:42:08,608 --> 00:42:10,276
What if I could fix that?

637
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:26,501
Hold still.

638
00:42:28,086 --> 00:42:30,630
First, a little beauty mark.

639
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:32,966
Letting me see.

640
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:35,373
- Not yet. Give me that mirror.
- Give to me, give to me!

641
00:42:37,971 --> 00:42:40,974
It is like looking at a completed stranger!

642
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:43,101
No, I'm not done. It's not even...

643
00:42:43,268 --> 00:42:46,312
You are a worker of
miraculous transformation!

644
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,939
Who is this Boov?

645
00:42:48,106 --> 00:42:49,524
I do not know!

646
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:51,859
All right, Oh.

647
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:55,322
Owpain.

648
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:16,510
Express elevator departing.

649
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:31,190
Whoa!

650
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:33,360
This is uber freaky.

651
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:36,029
These are the smartest Boov you have?

652
00:43:36,738 --> 00:43:38,740
You must be very quiet.

653
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:40,627
You do not want to break their concentra...

654
00:43:43,495 --> 00:43:44,579
Come party. Come party.

655
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:47,415
Oh! What is it?

656
00:43:47,582 --> 00:43:50,585
I thought the Big Brain Boovs
would have stopped my invitation by now.

657
00:43:50,752 --> 00:43:52,672
But they have still not
figured out my password.

658
00:43:52,712 --> 00:43:54,272
- How is this possible?
- Wait a minute.

659
00:43:54,422 --> 00:43:57,341
Does this mean those horrible monster
Gorg thingies will come to Earth?

660
00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:58,927
To Smekland, yes!

661
00:43:59,094 --> 00:44:00,345
And what happens then?

662
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:04,850
There will be no finding of Mimom!

663
00:44:05,767 --> 00:44:07,226
Then you've gotta fix this!

664
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:08,686
Yes.

665
00:44:10,063 --> 00:44:11,189
Hurry!

666
00:44:11,356 --> 00:44:13,107
By to the way, is your skull flexible?

667
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:14,067
- What?
- Never mind.

668
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:15,674
It will be probably okay.
Hold still.

669
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:29,957
Wow!

670
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:35,588
30 seconds to doom.

671
00:44:35,755 --> 00:44:37,631
I shall input my password. It is...

672
00:44:37,799 --> 00:44:42,299
"My name is Oh and Captain Smek is great and
anyone who does not think that is a poomp 1."

673
00:44:42,762 --> 00:44:44,263
I wonder why no one guessed that.

674
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:45,557
I do not know.

675
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:48,810
- It didn't work?
- Impossible!

676
00:44:48,977 --> 00:44:49,977
That is password!

677
00:44:50,061 --> 00:44:52,229
That is...
Oh, no! Caps Lock.

678
00:44:59,613 --> 00:45:00,631
Come on, come on, come on!

679
00:45:00,655 --> 00:45:02,948
Come party. Come party.
Come party. Come party.

680
00:45:05,785 --> 00:45:07,244
Come party. Come party.

681
00:45:19,799 --> 00:45:20,800
Yes!

682
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:29,476
Fa-da! It has worked.

683
00:45:29,643 --> 00:45:30,935
It worked!

684
00:45:31,102 --> 00:45:32,311
You did it, Oh!

685
00:45:35,815 --> 00:45:37,107
That was closeness.

686
00:45:37,275 --> 00:45:38,275
On your feet.

687
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:40,153
You still have to find my mom.

688
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:43,364
That is simplicity.
We shall now searching on...

689
00:45:43,531 --> 00:45:45,157
Lucy Tucci.

690
00:45:45,325 --> 00:45:47,285
"Lucy Tucci."

691
00:45:49,162 --> 00:45:50,872
Australia.

692
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:56,169
Observe Mimom.

693
00:45:57,879 --> 00:45:59,171
That's not funny.

694
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:00,715
This is not your mimom?

695
00:46:00,882 --> 00:46:01,882
Are you kidding?

696
00:46:02,467 --> 00:46:04,343
That's not her!

697
00:46:04,803 --> 00:46:05,887
Sure?

698
00:46:06,888 --> 00:46:08,222
I know, I know. Okay?

699
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:09,910
You've been saying that for two weeks.

700
00:46:10,058 --> 00:46:11,059
Please!

701
00:46:11,226 --> 00:46:14,729
She has big green eyes
and beautiful brown skin.

702
00:46:14,896 --> 00:46:16,022
Mom.

703
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:18,816
So tell me where she is.

704
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:20,902
Or find me a Boov who can.

705
00:46:23,321 --> 00:46:24,322
Please.

706
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:28,576
Gratuity Tucci looks just like tiny Mimom.

707
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:32,372
Gratuity Tucci? Whyfor...

708
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:35,500
Thank you! Thank you,
thank you, thank you, thank you!

709
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:44,050
I can't believe it!
My mom's in Australia!

710
00:46:44,217 --> 00:46:46,594
And I has cancelled my e-vite!

711
00:46:46,761 --> 00:46:48,763
I can finally come out of the hiding.

712
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:49,931
Yes!

713
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:03,110
Well, well, well.

714
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:06,531
Hello?

715
00:47:07,365 --> 00:47:08,366
Hold my crown.

716
00:47:08,533 --> 00:47:10,535
And be very careful.
It's the only one.

717
00:47:11,244 --> 00:47:12,870
Well, well, well.

718
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:15,957
Did you really think you could escape?

719
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:19,460
Escape? No, no, no.

720
00:47:19,627 --> 00:47:21,105
You see, I was just coming to tell you...

721
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:23,381
Despite your elaborate disguise...

722
00:47:23,923 --> 00:47:26,592
the computer recognized you as...

723
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,095
the fugitive Boov!

724
00:47:33,308 --> 00:47:34,726
But he's a hero Boov now!

725
00:47:34,893 --> 00:47:37,478
Yes! I has fixed my mistake!

726
00:47:37,645 --> 00:47:40,272
Yes, but before that,
you has made your mistake.

727
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,650
And many mistakes before that.

728
00:47:42,817 --> 00:47:46,111
- Wait, I have not...
- Many, many, many, many!

729
00:47:46,279 --> 00:47:47,113
Actually...

730
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,615
Many mistakes before that.

731
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:52,285
- So, I still has to erase you.
- Why?

732
00:47:52,452 --> 00:47:54,652
You cannot guarantee
you would not make a mistake again.

733
00:47:54,788 --> 00:47:56,414
- But I would not.
- But you might.

734
00:47:56,581 --> 00:47:57,767
- But I would not.
- But you might.

735
00:47:57,791 --> 00:47:58,583
But I would not.

736
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,311
We could go round and round.
Let's do it again!

737
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:01,604
- But I would not.
- But you might.

738
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:03,421
- But I would not.
- I love this!

739
00:48:04,964 --> 00:48:07,591
- But I would not!
- Bored now.

740
00:48:07,759 --> 00:48:08,801
- But I would...
- Shush!

741
00:48:08,968 --> 00:48:09,968
Erase him!

742
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:14,640
Drop the bubble guns!

743
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:17,143
Or I will mess with this...

744
00:48:17,602 --> 00:48:19,437
gravity thingy.

745
00:48:19,604 --> 00:48:20,855
She is bluffing.

746
00:48:21,147 --> 00:48:23,941
She could not possibly reach
the gravity thingy.

747
00:48:24,984 --> 00:48:27,194
Curse you and your tippy-toe tallness!

748
00:48:28,154 --> 00:48:29,155
But no problem.

749
00:48:29,322 --> 00:48:33,822
Boov technology is far too complicated
for simple humansgirl to figure out.

750
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:36,162
Excuse me?

751
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:40,834
This humansgirl got an "A" in geometry.

752
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:47,298
She figured it out!
Run for my life!

753
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:51,010
Out of my way! I am captain!

754
00:49:06,192 --> 00:49:07,193
Grab on!

755
00:49:08,153 --> 00:49:09,404
Oh, no! I can't hold you!

756
00:49:10,155 --> 00:49:11,906
You weigh, like, a thousand pounds!

757
00:49:13,032 --> 00:49:13,699
Let go.

758
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:15,702
- What?
- Trust me.

759
00:49:22,333 --> 00:49:24,376
Sorry. It is my duty to run away first.

760
00:49:26,212 --> 00:49:26,879
Poomp.

761
00:49:27,046 --> 00:49:28,881
- What are you waiting for?
- I cannot touch.

762
00:49:29,048 --> 00:49:30,549
It will not work if I drive it.

763
00:49:31,384 --> 00:49:32,843
Fine. I'll drive.

764
00:49:38,516 --> 00:49:39,516
Owpain.

765
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:45,147
You are terrible driver.

766
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:12,342
Come on.

767
00:50:13,384 --> 00:50:14,718
Come on. Come on.

768
00:50:15,553 --> 00:50:16,095
Bon appétit.

769
00:50:16,221 --> 00:50:17,388
Oh, no, you don't!

770
00:50:17,555 --> 00:50:19,056
I am not paying for that.

771
00:50:37,408 --> 00:50:39,284
Come on, you stupid horse!

772
00:50:47,418 --> 00:50:48,752
Whoo, that was cl...

773
00:50:59,305 --> 00:51:00,306
This time I got you...

774
00:51:00,473 --> 00:51:02,141
and you cannot escape.

775
00:51:02,892 --> 00:51:03,976
Fugitive Boov detected.

776
00:51:04,143 --> 00:51:05,143
I was wrong.

777
00:51:10,316 --> 00:51:11,316
Jump!

778
00:51:11,442 --> 00:51:12,443
Oh, no!

779
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:26,415
Look! I has found our car.

780
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:27,584
Pig!

781
00:51:36,926 --> 00:51:39,178
I do not know whyfor you brought that.

782
00:51:39,345 --> 00:51:41,013
We already hads food in the car.

783
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:43,182
It's not food, it's art.

784
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:45,685
Then it is bad.

785
00:51:45,852 --> 00:51:47,979
Stars do not look like that.

786
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:49,522
It's not about how they look.

787
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:51,816
It's about how they feel.

788
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:53,775
They feel hot.

789
00:51:54,944 --> 00:51:58,030
Okay, math whiz, how long
till we get to Australia?

790
00:51:58,197 --> 00:52:00,365
17.9348 hours.

791
00:52:00,867 --> 00:52:02,535
And then, Gratuity Tucci...

792
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:04,161
will see Mimom.

793
00:52:06,789 --> 00:52:07,873
You hear that, Pig?

794
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:10,710
I can't wait to tell Mom
I actually went to Paris...

795
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:13,045
which you know she always wanted to do.

796
00:52:13,212 --> 00:52:15,214
Maybe we could both come back here.

797
00:52:15,381 --> 00:52:17,299
We do have a flying car now.

798
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:20,052
How do you say "cat" in French?

799
00:52:20,553 --> 00:52:22,346
I think it's "chat."

800
00:52:32,523 --> 00:52:34,650
What is the purpose of your face?

801
00:52:38,363 --> 00:52:40,198
I has confusion.

802
00:52:41,866 --> 00:52:44,410
I do not wish to be erased.

803
00:52:45,244 --> 00:52:47,746
But maybe Captain Smek is right.

804
00:52:48,247 --> 00:52:52,542
It is possible I will continue
making hilarious mistakes.

805
00:52:53,086 --> 00:52:54,087
Probably.

806
00:52:54,253 --> 00:52:56,255
That is not making me feel better.

807
00:52:56,422 --> 00:52:58,090
Nobody's perfect.

808
00:52:58,257 --> 00:53:02,594
My mom says your mistakes
are what make you human.

809
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:05,055
That is not what makes you Boov.

810
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:09,936
Gratuity Tucci...

811
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:12,105
before we came...

812
00:53:12,271 --> 00:53:15,983
Captain Smek telled us
that the humans needed us.

813
00:53:16,484 --> 00:53:19,320
That the humans were
just like the animals...

814
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:21,780
and that we could to make them better...

815
00:53:21,948 --> 00:53:23,699
teach to them.

816
00:53:23,866 --> 00:53:28,366
We were told the humans
were simple and backwards.

817
00:53:30,623 --> 00:53:32,916
It is what we thought.

818
00:53:33,292 --> 00:53:34,459
But I am thinking now...

819
00:53:35,837 --> 00:53:38,297
that we were thinking wrong.

820
00:53:38,464 --> 00:53:41,383
And that Captain Smek is the wrongest.

821
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:45,930
I am thinking the Boov
should never have come to Smekland.

822
00:53:46,097 --> 00:53:48,432
To Earthland.

823
00:53:48,933 --> 00:53:52,853
So I am saying
the sorry to you...

824
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:54,646
Gratuity Tucci.

825
00:54:03,656 --> 00:54:05,783
Call me Tip.

826
00:54:11,164 --> 00:54:15,084
It was a new home, a new country.

827
00:54:15,251 --> 00:54:16,961
I tried to make friends at school...

828
00:54:17,128 --> 00:54:20,965
but I was this nerd from Barbados.

829
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:24,176
But you dids to get
an "A" in geometry.

830
00:54:24,343 --> 00:54:25,886
Yeah, I did.

831
00:54:26,512 --> 00:54:29,348
I know when the other Boovs said "Oh"...

832
00:54:29,515 --> 00:54:32,059
they were not happy to see me.

833
00:54:33,644 --> 00:54:36,730
The true is, among Boov,
I do not fit in.

834
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:39,066
I fit out.

835
00:54:41,986 --> 00:54:44,154
She is so amazing.

836
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:46,449
She saved up everything she had...

837
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:49,577
so we could move
and things would be better for us.

838
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:52,788
I cannot wait to meet Mimom.

839
00:54:57,752 --> 00:55:00,588
"My name is Captain Smek.
Shush, shush, shush."

840
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:05,255
"Boov technology is far too complicated
for simple humansgirl to figure out."

841
00:56:33,806 --> 00:56:34,890
How did they find us?

842
00:56:35,057 --> 00:56:36,308
I do not know!

843
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:45,025
Wait. They're not attacking.

844
00:56:45,192 --> 00:56:47,235
Because they are running away.

845
00:56:48,404 --> 00:56:49,822
Why are they running away?

846
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:51,740
There can only be one reason.

847
00:57:04,962 --> 00:57:05,962
Gorg.

848
00:57:06,464 --> 00:57:09,300
This makes no sense.
I stopped the message.

849
00:57:10,259 --> 00:57:11,635
Gorg cannot to finding us.

850
00:57:12,345 --> 00:57:13,637
Then how did they?

851
00:57:13,804 --> 00:57:16,014
There must be some other reason!

852
00:57:20,436 --> 00:57:21,937
Oh, behind us!

853
00:57:22,104 --> 00:57:23,855
Engage weapons system.

854
00:57:24,023 --> 00:57:25,524
We have a weapons system?

855
00:57:30,321 --> 00:57:32,573
Go, Burrito Torpedo!

856
00:57:35,159 --> 00:57:36,159
Yes!

857
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:40,831
We've been hit!
We're losing Grape Escape!

858
00:57:40,998 --> 00:57:42,416
We lost Tangerine Twist!

859
00:57:42,583 --> 00:57:45,627
If we lose Busta Lime, I cannot control!

860
00:57:45,836 --> 00:57:47,587
Click and ticket.
We are to crash!

861
00:57:47,755 --> 00:57:48,755
Oh!

862
00:58:06,565 --> 00:58:07,565
No, no, no.

863
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:09,234
Slushious! No!

864
00:58:11,612 --> 00:58:13,196
Don't just stand there! Help!

865
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:16,408
Come on, come on, come on!

866
00:58:16,575 --> 00:58:18,910
Slushious! No!

867
00:58:26,210 --> 00:58:26,960
She's gone.

868
00:58:27,128 --> 00:58:28,129
We are doomed.

869
00:58:28,295 --> 00:58:28,336
Now I'll never make it to Australia.

870
00:58:28,337 --> 00:58:29,796
Now I'll never make it to Australia.

871
00:58:29,964 --> 00:58:32,091
I will now sing the Boov Death Song.

872
00:58:40,933 --> 00:58:41,975
A Gorg ship!

873
00:58:42,143 --> 00:58:43,703
It is rude to interrupt the Death Song.

874
00:58:43,769 --> 00:58:46,730
Maybe you could take the
parts from it to fix our car.

875
00:58:46,981 --> 00:58:49,817
I cannot. Those are Gorg parts.
They are metric.

876
00:58:49,984 --> 00:58:52,486
We're not getting this close
and giving up.

877
00:58:52,653 --> 00:58:53,737
- Come on.
- No!

878
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:56,216
Always with the running towards danger.

879
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:59,493
Stop being such a Boov.
It's our only chance. Come on.

880
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:05,165
This has low probability of success!

881
00:59:12,089 --> 00:59:13,632
- Let's go.
- Wait!

882
00:59:13,924 --> 00:59:14,966
For what?

883
00:59:15,426 --> 00:59:17,094
For you to change your mind.

884
00:59:17,428 --> 00:59:18,429
Come on.

885
00:59:34,987 --> 00:59:35,988
There's no pilot.

886
00:59:36,155 --> 00:59:37,781
It is just a drone.

887
00:59:41,368 --> 00:59:42,869
That could have been badness.

888
00:59:43,037 --> 00:59:44,538
But we are not safety.

889
00:59:44,705 --> 00:59:47,124
Gorg mothership will be here
soon enough.

890
00:59:49,376 --> 00:59:50,668
Can you use any of this?

891
00:59:50,836 --> 00:59:52,045
Broken.

892
00:59:52,213 --> 00:59:53,339
Useless.

893
00:59:53,506 --> 00:59:55,508
Likely to cause thermonuclear fission.

894
00:59:58,469 --> 00:59:59,845
What is it?

895
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:01,305
It is Gorg super-chip!

896
01:00:03,516 --> 01:00:05,351
Why is it called a super-chip?

897
01:00:05,518 --> 01:00:06,685
It is mostly marketing.

898
01:00:06,852 --> 01:00:08,520
But it is key...

899
01:00:08,687 --> 01:00:12,357
for the Gorg are having machines
that are stronger and better at everything.

900
01:00:12,525 --> 01:00:14,527
So we can never fight them with equaltude.

901
01:00:14,693 --> 01:00:16,194
Can we use it to fix Slushious?

902
01:00:16,362 --> 01:00:18,655
Yes, yes! The Slushious will fly again.

903
01:00:18,823 --> 01:00:19,865
Yes!

904
01:00:28,916 --> 01:00:31,585
It was low probability of success.

905
01:00:31,752 --> 01:00:33,712
Some Boov you are.

906
01:00:35,506 --> 01:00:36,506
Quickly.

907
01:00:36,590 --> 01:00:38,508
We must fix the Slushious
and find Mimom.

908
01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:39,718
"My" mom.

909
01:00:39,885 --> 01:00:41,052
That is the thing I said.

910
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:43,513
I knew this would all work out!

911
01:00:46,892 --> 01:00:48,602
You were awesome!

912
01:00:48,769 --> 01:00:49,895
We're gonna find my mom...

913
01:00:50,062 --> 01:00:52,898
you're gonna show everybody
the super-chip and be a big hero...

914
01:00:53,065 --> 01:00:55,442
and even Captain Smek will have to...

915
01:00:58,529 --> 01:01:00,572
That's a lot of people.

916
01:01:06,871 --> 01:01:08,205
- Bye, Boov!
- Get lost!

917
01:01:21,218 --> 01:01:24,638
Wow. You guys really are good
at running away.

918
01:01:24,805 --> 01:01:25,806
Yes.

919
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:27,933
Yes, we are.

920
01:01:36,442 --> 01:01:37,442
Look, over there!

921
01:01:37,484 --> 01:01:39,110
That's where we saw my mom!

922
01:01:48,621 --> 01:01:50,164
Hurry up, it is the last ship!

923
01:01:53,959 --> 01:01:56,294
It's okay, Pig.
I'll be back with Mom.

924
01:02:00,174 --> 01:02:01,008
We're almost there!

925
01:02:01,175 --> 01:02:02,009
Over here.

926
01:02:02,176 --> 01:02:03,260
- What?
- Hurry!

927
01:02:10,434 --> 01:02:13,019
I don't understand.
She's in there?

928
01:02:15,648 --> 01:02:16,648
Yes.

929
01:02:18,609 --> 01:02:19,693
Tell me the truth.

930
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:21,194
There is no time.

931
01:02:21,362 --> 01:02:22,988
You can come with me.

932
01:02:23,155 --> 01:02:25,448
You will be safety.

933
01:02:27,368 --> 01:02:30,287
My mom's not on that ship, is she?

934
01:02:32,289 --> 01:02:35,333
You promised to help me find her,
and you're leaving?

935
01:02:36,877 --> 01:02:38,712
- You lied to me.
- No!

936
01:02:38,879 --> 01:02:40,964
A lie is a bad thing.

937
01:02:41,131 --> 01:02:43,216
I did a thing so you can live.

938
01:02:43,384 --> 01:02:45,844
I'm not going. My mom is here.

939
01:02:46,011 --> 01:02:47,345
You will never find her.

940
01:02:47,513 --> 01:02:48,889
It is 100%.

941
01:02:49,056 --> 01:02:51,516
Staying now does not make hope.

942
01:02:51,684 --> 01:02:53,727
Gorg mothership will be here soon.

943
01:02:54,687 --> 01:02:56,021
It destroys planets.

944
01:02:56,855 --> 01:02:58,815
- We must run away now!
- No!

945
01:02:58,983 --> 01:03:00,234
It is true.

946
01:03:00,401 --> 01:03:03,862
Humanspersons cannot even understand
simple, simple things.

947
01:03:04,029 --> 01:03:06,573
I am saving you!
I am being your friend.

948
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:09,200
No, you're just running away.

949
01:03:09,368 --> 01:03:11,661
You don't leave your family.

950
01:03:11,829 --> 01:03:13,109
But you can't understand that...

951
01:03:13,205 --> 01:03:15,373
because you're just a Boov!

952
01:03:16,583 --> 01:03:19,419
You've never been my friend.

953
01:03:27,219 --> 01:03:28,219
Wait!

954
01:03:28,345 --> 01:03:30,513
Final escape pod departing.

955
01:04:12,806 --> 01:04:15,975
I hate upon the Gorg!
They are always finding us!

956
01:04:16,143 --> 01:04:17,561
The Gorg mothership!

957
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:35,912
We are doomed!

958
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:37,080
Run away!

959
01:04:37,122 --> 01:04:38,790
Make a path, I'm holding a baby.

960
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:48,758
It is the fugitive Boov!

961
01:04:48,926 --> 01:04:50,969
He is running towards the danger!

962
01:04:51,303 --> 01:04:52,304
Stop him!

963
01:05:04,274 --> 01:05:05,483
Undo!

964
01:05:24,503 --> 01:05:27,339
Captain, we are achieving
new highest speeds!

965
01:05:28,632 --> 01:05:31,468
What has you done?
What is that thing?

966
01:05:32,010 --> 01:05:33,803
It is Gorg super-chip.

967
01:05:34,304 --> 01:05:35,304
What?

968
01:05:35,389 --> 01:05:36,556
Gorg drone crashed...

969
01:05:36,723 --> 01:05:39,016
and I ran to it
and I found the chip.

970
01:05:39,184 --> 01:05:39,851
Enough.

971
01:05:40,018 --> 01:05:41,853
You ran to a Gorg?

972
01:05:43,355 --> 01:05:45,190
He runs towards the danger?

973
01:05:45,357 --> 01:05:46,691
What kind of Boov is he?

974
01:05:46,859 --> 01:05:49,820
He is like a Super Boov.

975
01:05:49,987 --> 01:05:52,030
No, no, no.

976
01:05:52,197 --> 01:05:53,823
He is not a Super Boov.

977
01:05:53,991 --> 01:05:57,828
There is only one Super Boov
on this ship, and you know who it is.

978
01:05:57,995 --> 01:05:59,371
You're looking at him.

979
01:05:59,538 --> 01:06:01,540
I invented running away.

980
01:06:01,707 --> 01:06:05,001
And look at this.
I have the Shusher.

981
01:06:05,252 --> 01:06:07,379
I am your captain.

982
01:06:07,546 --> 01:06:09,047
But you are not good captain.

983
01:06:09,214 --> 01:06:10,256
What?

984
01:06:10,424 --> 01:06:13,760
You telled us these things,
and we all believed them.

985
01:06:14,219 --> 01:06:15,720
I believed them.

986
01:06:16,513 --> 01:06:19,390
But then I met a humansperson.

987
01:06:20,225 --> 01:06:22,393
And she is not like you said.

988
01:06:24,188 --> 01:06:26,857
She is brave and smart...

989
01:06:27,024 --> 01:06:30,402
and cares about other humanspersons.

990
01:06:30,569 --> 01:06:34,739
In a way that we Boov
do not even care about each other.

991
01:06:36,783 --> 01:06:38,910
She even cares about me.

992
01:06:39,536 --> 01:06:42,080
And I've done very little to earn that.

993
01:06:43,081 --> 01:06:45,958
The Boov may be superior in many ways...

994
01:06:46,251 --> 01:06:47,085
Yeah.

995
01:06:47,252 --> 01:06:50,463
But not in the ways that I now thinks
are most important.

996
01:06:54,927 --> 01:06:56,136
Big deal!

997
01:06:56,303 --> 01:06:57,554
I have had enough. Shush!

998
01:07:00,474 --> 01:07:03,643
That is enough shushing.

999
01:07:03,810 --> 01:07:05,645
How dare you shush a shushing!

1000
01:07:05,812 --> 01:07:08,606
Oh is right.
We need a new captain.

1001
01:07:09,066 --> 01:07:11,902
I thinks it should be Oh!

1002
01:07:12,444 --> 01:07:14,112
Me? No.

1003
01:07:14,279 --> 01:07:15,738
No! He cannot be captain.

1004
01:07:15,906 --> 01:07:18,158
I have the Shusher. I am captain!

1005
01:07:18,325 --> 01:07:19,325
Not anymore!

1006
01:07:21,453 --> 01:07:23,079
He will not know how to operate it!

1007
01:07:23,247 --> 01:07:24,790
It is very complicated.

1008
01:07:24,957 --> 01:07:26,434
Heavy on one end, light on the other.

1009
01:07:26,458 --> 01:07:27,459
Shush!

1010
01:07:28,460 --> 01:07:29,627
Booyah!

1011
01:07:30,128 --> 01:07:32,630
No, I am not a Leader Boov.

1012
01:07:32,798 --> 01:07:34,132
I makes far too many mistakes.

1013
01:07:34,591 --> 01:07:37,427
You are not the only Boov
who makes mistakes.

1014
01:07:38,136 --> 01:07:39,595
For examples...

1015
01:07:39,763 --> 01:07:43,308
my mistake is not being your friend.

1016
01:07:50,357 --> 01:07:52,484
All hail Captain Oh!

1017
01:07:55,153 --> 01:07:56,279
I saw who did that!

1018
01:07:56,446 --> 01:07:57,989
I hold grudges, you know!

1019
01:08:06,123 --> 01:08:07,457
Oh, you're the best!

1020
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,127
Want me to host party, Oh?

1021
01:09:47,683 --> 01:09:49,518
Go away.

1022
01:09:49,935 --> 01:09:53,355
No, you are supposed to be saying
"Who is there?"

1023
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:54,856
Then I am to be saying...

1024
01:09:55,023 --> 01:09:56,232
"Moo!"

1025
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:57,400
Oh!

1026
01:09:59,444 --> 01:10:01,737
I can't believe it!

1027
01:10:02,197 --> 01:10:03,948
But I saw your ship leave!

1028
01:10:06,785 --> 01:10:09,954
But you came back!
What are you doing here?

1029
01:10:10,122 --> 01:10:11,623
It is where I belongs.

1030
01:10:11,790 --> 01:10:14,584
You and Pigcat are my friends.

1031
01:10:15,419 --> 01:10:16,920
And alsos, too...

1032
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:18,963
I gave you a promise.

1033
01:11:41,004 --> 01:11:42,213
He's my friend.

1034
01:11:45,634 --> 01:11:46,718
Thank you.

1035
01:11:50,639 --> 01:11:51,806
Mom.

1036
01:11:55,852 --> 01:11:57,395
Tippy. My beautiful girl.

1037
01:11:57,562 --> 01:12:00,231
I've been looking everywhere, Mom.

1038
01:12:00,398 --> 01:12:03,025
I was so scared we'd never
see each other again.

1039
01:12:03,193 --> 01:12:06,321
Mom, I never would have stopped looking
until I found you.

1040
01:12:10,492 --> 01:12:12,410
They are still looking.

1041
01:12:29,052 --> 01:12:30,928
Gorg are not the takers.

1042
01:12:31,763 --> 01:12:33,264
Boov are.

1043
01:12:37,644 --> 01:12:40,146
We must demonstrate our affections later.

1044
01:12:40,313 --> 01:12:42,148
There is still one problem.

1045
01:12:42,315 --> 01:12:44,108
Excuse me, what is that?

1046
01:12:44,276 --> 01:12:47,112
That is Gorg mothership.
It is here to destroy the planet.

1047
01:12:52,367 --> 01:12:53,687
It's going to destroy the planet?

1048
01:12:53,827 --> 01:12:56,329
Yes. But I haves a plan.

1049
01:13:10,802 --> 01:13:11,928
Oh?

1050
01:13:15,015 --> 01:13:16,182
What are you doing?

1051
01:13:16,349 --> 01:13:17,850
I am sorry.

1052
01:13:18,018 --> 01:13:20,687
Tip cannot come into the out now.

1053
01:13:20,854 --> 01:13:22,814
I am fixing my mistake.

1054
01:13:23,315 --> 01:13:26,526
Oh! You can't do this on your own!

1055
01:13:26,693 --> 01:13:28,403
Maybe not.

1056
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:30,613
But I haves hope.

1057
01:13:33,909 --> 01:13:34,618
No!

1058
01:13:34,784 --> 01:13:35,910
Stop, no!

1059
01:13:36,995 --> 01:13:38,496
Please don't do this by yourself!

1060
01:13:44,711 --> 01:13:45,753
No! Don't!

1061
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:48,172
Oh!

1062
01:14:07,567 --> 01:14:10,069
Stop!

1063
01:14:13,615 --> 01:14:15,366
Look!

1064
01:14:21,581 --> 01:14:22,832
Hey!

1065
01:14:30,256 --> 01:14:31,966
Gorg!

1066
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:34,802
It is useless to yell.

1067
01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:36,304
Gorg!

1068
01:14:45,647 --> 01:14:47,065
They're not gonna see him.

1069
01:14:47,232 --> 01:14:48,399
It's not gonna work!

1070
01:14:49,275 --> 01:14:50,317
Merry Christmas.

1071
01:14:50,485 --> 01:14:51,944
- Now?
- Just open it.

1072
01:14:54,948 --> 01:14:56,950
Thank you, sweetheart, but what...

1073
01:14:57,617 --> 01:14:58,367
What are you doing?

1074
01:14:58,535 --> 01:15:00,620
Distracting the driver.

1075
01:15:35,196 --> 01:15:37,406
It worked! The ship's stopping!

1076
01:15:44,956 --> 01:15:46,374
It's not gonna stop in time!

1077
01:15:54,215 --> 01:15:55,799
Stop faster!

1078
01:15:55,967 --> 01:15:57,843
He's gotta get out of there!

1079
01:15:59,012 --> 01:16:01,514
Mom, help me with this thing!

1080
01:16:10,315 --> 01:16:11,316
Oh!

1081
01:16:11,816 --> 01:16:12,816
Oh!

1082
01:16:12,901 --> 01:16:14,319
Run!

1083
01:16:14,611 --> 01:16:15,278
Tip!

1084
01:16:15,445 --> 01:16:16,487
Stop!

1085
01:16:16,654 --> 01:16:17,905
Tip!

1086
01:17:20,885 --> 01:17:21,886
Mom!

1087
01:17:53,418 --> 01:17:54,502
Oh!

1088
01:18:00,258 --> 01:18:01,425
You're alive.

1089
01:18:01,593 --> 01:18:03,928
But you scared me so bad!

1090
01:18:04,095 --> 01:18:05,596
You were scared?

1091
01:18:05,763 --> 01:18:07,848
I almost made a number three.

1092
01:18:08,016 --> 01:18:09,016
Not too hard!

1093
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:11,602
It is still a possibility.

1094
01:20:20,940 --> 01:20:23,067
What was all that?

1095
01:20:23,234 --> 01:20:26,862
Not all Gorg-speak has humans words.

1096
01:20:27,030 --> 01:20:31,530
But, it turns out, Gorg was not here
because of my invitation...

1097
01:20:31,743 --> 01:20:34,036
though Gorg would have been happy
to attend.

1098
01:20:35,079 --> 01:20:39,249
Gorg was here
because Gorg was tracking the rock.

1099
01:20:39,417 --> 01:20:40,918
What was in that thing?

1100
01:20:41,085 --> 01:20:42,211
Gorg family.

1101
01:20:42,795 --> 01:20:45,631
It is entire next generation.

1102
01:20:45,923 --> 01:20:47,257
All of them?

1103
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:49,259
All of them.

1104
01:20:59,729 --> 01:21:01,897
No wonder they've been chasing you.

1105
01:21:02,607 --> 01:21:05,109
Not "they," "he."

1106
01:21:05,276 --> 01:21:09,113
Apparently, that Gorg is last Gorg.

1107
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:11,282
That is why rock was so important.

1108
01:21:11,449 --> 01:21:13,451
Without it, he was alonely...

1109
01:21:13,618 --> 01:21:16,037
and would someday be extinctly...

1110
01:21:16,204 --> 01:21:19,248
which made Gorg cranky and irrational...

1111
01:21:19,415 --> 01:21:21,625
and physically violent.

1112
01:21:21,793 --> 01:21:23,753
He was just like humansgirl.

1113
01:21:25,213 --> 01:21:28,799
He was sad-mad.

1114
01:21:36,808 --> 01:21:37,975
Thanking you.

1115
01:21:38,476 --> 01:21:40,811
Thanking you!
High hand touching.

1116
01:21:40,978 --> 01:21:42,646
Yeah, give it here. High hand touching.

1117
01:21:42,814 --> 01:21:45,149
Up high! You are too slow.

1118
01:21:46,317 --> 01:21:48,944
High hand touching! That hurt.

1119
01:22:14,512 --> 01:22:15,513
Pigcat!

1120
01:22:17,181 --> 01:22:18,182
Hey, Oh!

1121
01:22:20,101 --> 01:22:21,352
Hello, friend Kyle.

1122
01:22:21,519 --> 01:22:23,437
I have that same color.

1123
01:22:23,604 --> 01:22:25,480
- Hi, Mimom.
- Hi, Oh.

1124
01:22:25,648 --> 01:22:26,940
Awesome party, Oh!

1125
01:22:27,108 --> 01:22:29,944
Parties are so much more fun
when other people show up.

1126
01:22:30,611 --> 01:22:32,279
Is it time to pick it up a level?

1127
01:22:32,447 --> 01:22:33,447
Yes!

1128
01:22:34,365 --> 01:22:35,991
This is gonna be sweet!

1129
01:22:36,159 --> 01:22:38,161
Drop it like it has a high temperature!

1130
01:22:53,217 --> 01:22:54,384
Oh, no!

1131
01:22:57,555 --> 01:22:59,390
What is happening to my body?

1132
01:23:04,729 --> 01:23:06,731
Shake your Boov thang!

1133
01:23:07,315 --> 01:23:10,234
My hands are in the air
like I just do not care!

1134
01:23:14,405 --> 01:23:18,905
I has a new start in a new home
with new friends.

1135
01:23:19,410 --> 01:23:23,539
And now, every day is best day ever!

1136
01:23:44,769 --> 01:23:47,354
You are all invited
to a party, party, party.

1137
01:23:47,522 --> 01:23:50,066
Just head to the Milky Way.
Turn right at the Big Dipper.

1138
01:23:50,233 --> 01:23:51,692
Third planet from the Sun.

1139
01:23:51,859 --> 01:23:53,235
Look for my balloons!

1140
01:23:53,402 --> 01:23:54,694
Come party!

1141
01:23:56,197 --> 01:23:57,781
Everybody, smile!
