1
00:02:42,226 --> 00:02:44,351
I'm stuck!

2
00:02:53,267 --> 00:02:55,849
Get back.

3
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:05,471
Hmm!

4
00:03:40,256 --> 00:03:42,636
- Mr. Tweedy.
- Eh?

5
00:03:42,673 --> 00:03:46,504
What is that chicken
doing outside the fence?

6
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:49,668
Oh! I don't know, love. L...

7
00:03:49,704 --> 00:03:52,795
Just deal with it. Now!

8
00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:03,667
I'll teach you to make a fool out of me.

9
00:04:08,249 --> 00:04:11,602
Now let that be a
lesson to the lot of ya!

10
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:14,957
No chicken escapes from Tweedy's farm!

11
00:05:54,352 --> 00:05:58,308
Oh!

12
00:07:33,456 --> 00:07:37,080
Morning, Ginger. Back from holiday?

13
00:07:37,117 --> 00:07:39,181
I wasn't on holiday, Babs.

14
00:07:39,218 --> 00:07:41,210
I was in solitary confinement.

15
00:07:41,247 --> 00:07:44,328
Oh, it's nice to get a bit
of time to yourself, isn't it?

16
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:51,578
Roll call!

17
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,666
Come along now. You'll
be late for parade.

18
00:07:53,702 --> 00:07:57,123
Pip, pip. Quick march.
Left, right, left, right!

19
00:07:57,159 --> 00:08:00,658
- Come on. Smarten up.
- Ooh!

20
00:08:00,695 --> 00:08:02,622
Discipline! Order!

21
00:08:02,658 --> 00:08:06,575
Back in my R.A.F. Days when the
senior officer called for a scramble,

22
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:07,885
You'd hop in the old crate and tallyho.

23
00:08:08,303 --> 00:08:09,161
Chocks away!

24
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:13,155
Give over, you old fool.
They just want to count us.

25
00:08:13,614 --> 00:08:16,494
Oh, how dare you talk back
to a senior ranking officer.

26
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:20,487
- Why, back in my R.A.F. Days...
- Fowler, they're coming. Back in line.

27
00:08:20,524 --> 00:08:24,117
- Oh, right, right.
- Oh!

28
00:08:24,153 --> 00:08:28,070
There will be a stern reprimand
for you, lad. You're grounded.

29
00:08:29,278 --> 00:08:33,193
Attention!

30
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,357
Welcome back, hen. Is there a new plan?

31
00:08:56,146 --> 00:08:59,604
I thought we tried goin' under.

32
00:08:59,641 --> 00:09:03,521
Ah! Over. Right.

33
00:09:13,433 --> 00:09:15,397
How's the egg count?

34
00:09:15,433 --> 00:09:18,454
I've laid five eggs this morning. Five!

35
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:21,475
- Well-Chuffed with that, I was...
- Shush!

36
00:09:28,391 --> 00:09:32,306
Oh, no. Edwina.

37
00:09:33,764 --> 00:09:36,435
Bunty, why didn't you
give her some of yours?

38
00:09:36,472 --> 00:09:40,429
I would have. She didn't tell
me. She didn't tell anyone.

39
00:09:49,969 --> 00:09:53,925
Oh, is Edwina off on holiday?

40
00:10:50,622 --> 00:10:54,079
We've got to get out of here.

41
00:10:54,116 --> 00:10:57,201
Ginger! Are we still on?

42
00:10:57,237 --> 00:11:00,250
Oh, we're on, all right.

43
00:11:00,286 --> 00:11:04,203
Spread the word, Mac.
Meeting tonight in hut 17.

44
00:11:25,074 --> 00:11:29,031
Oh!

45
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,576
You called? Nick and...

46
00:11:33,612 --> 00:11:36,529
- Fetcher.
- At your service.

47
00:11:40,611 --> 00:11:44,568
Over here.

48
00:11:45,653 --> 00:11:47,444
We need some more things.

49
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,094
Right you are, miss.

50
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:51,348
How about this quality
handcrafted tea set?

51
00:11:51,349 --> 00:11:51,796
Uh, no.

52
00:11:51,832 --> 00:11:53,906
- Or this lovely necklace and pendant?
- It's love...

53
00:11:53,943 --> 00:11:55,504
Or this beautiful little number,

54
00:11:55,505 --> 00:11:58,525
All the rage in the fashionable
chicken coops of Paris.

55
00:11:59,107 --> 00:12:01,196
Simply pop it on like so,

56
00:12:01,232 --> 00:12:03,440
And as the French hens say, "Voila!"

57
00:12:03,476 --> 00:12:04,695
That's French.

58
00:12:04,731 --> 00:12:08,647
That's two hats in one, miss.
For parties, for weddings.

59
00:12:09,126 --> 00:12:13,397
Oh, but madame, this makes you
look like a vision, like a dream.

60
00:12:13,562 --> 00:12:15,983
- Like a duck.
- No, thank you.

61
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:20,144
We're making this. We need
these things. Can you get them?

62
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:23,981
Oh, oh, oh, this is a big job, miss.

63
00:12:23,185 --> 00:12:26,560
Oh, bigger than the others.
No, no. This is gonna cost.

64
00:12:26,597 --> 00:12:29,523
Same as always. One bag of seed.

65
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:31,933
- You call this pay?
- It's chicken feed.

66
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:34,308
- What else could we give you?
- Eggs.

67
00:12:34,345 --> 00:12:36,271
- Eggs?
- Eggs.

68
00:12:36,307 --> 00:12:38,286
We can't give you our
eggs. They're too valuable.

69
00:12:38,392 --> 00:12:40,266
And so are we.

70
00:12:42,641 --> 00:12:46,056
After you, Fetcher.

71
00:12:46,093 --> 00:12:48,177
After I what?

72
00:12:48,214 --> 00:12:50,264
- Move!
- Ooh!

73
00:12:57,178 --> 00:12:59,974
Hmm.

74
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:02,225
Twenty-Two and nine.

75
00:13:02,261 --> 00:13:05,385
Fourteen shillings and threepence.

76
00:13:05,422 --> 00:13:08,509
Seven and sixpence times three.

77
00:13:08,546 --> 00:13:10,556
Two and nine.

78
00:13:10,593 --> 00:13:13,889
Fourpence halfpenny.

79
00:13:13,925 --> 00:13:17,472
D
- Oh! Stupid, worthless creatures!

80
00:13:17,508 --> 00:13:21,466
I'm sick and tired of
making minuscule profits.

81
00:13:32,422 --> 00:13:36,379
Hmm.

82
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,898
Hmm!

83
00:13:42,934 --> 00:13:45,340
Oh, yes.

84
00:13:45,376 --> 00:13:47,669
Those chickens are up to something.

85
00:13:47,705 --> 00:13:50,352
Quiet. I'm onto something.

86
00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:52,962
They're organized. I know it.

87
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,416
- I said, quiet.
- That ginger one.

88
00:13:55,452 --> 00:13:57,415
I reckon she's their leader.

89
00:13:57,451 --> 00:13:59,587
- Mr. Tweedy!

90
00:13:59,624 --> 00:14:03,415
I may finally have found a way to
make us some real money around here,

91
00:14:03,451 --> 00:14:05,419
And what are you on about?

92
00:14:05,455 --> 00:14:07,419
Ridiculous notions of escaping chickens.

93
00:14:07,455 --> 00:14:11,412
- But... But...
- It's all in your head, Mr. Tweedy. Say it!

94
00:14:12,539 --> 00:14:15,121
It's all in me head.
It's all in me head.

95
00:14:15,157 --> 00:14:18,374
Now, you keep telling yourself that,

96
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:21,245
Because I don't want to
hear another word about it.

97
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,907
- Is that clear?
- Yes, love.

98
00:14:23,944 --> 00:14:26,718
But you know that ginger one...

99
00:14:26,754 --> 00:14:29,455
They're chickens, you dolt!

100
00:14:29,492 --> 00:14:33,346
Apart from you, they're the most
stupid creatures on this planet.

101
00:14:33,382 --> 00:14:37,199
They don't plot, they don't
scheme, and they are not organized!

102
00:14:38,616 --> 00:14:42,578
- Order! Order!

103
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:46,572
- Quiet, everyone. Settle down.

104
00:14:46,989 --> 00:14:50,946
I would like to call to order...
Please, if you could just settle...

105
00:14:51,904 --> 00:14:54,362
Let's have some discipline
in the ranks! What, what!

106
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,617
- Thank you, Fowler.
- In my R.A.F. Days,

107
00:14:56,653 --> 00:14:59,610
We were never allowed to waste
time with unnecessary chitchat.

108
00:14:59,647 --> 00:15:02,026
Yes, thank you, Fowler.

109
00:15:02,062 --> 00:15:05,944
I...

110
00:15:06,067 --> 00:15:10,025
Right!

111
00:15:11,109 --> 00:15:14,945
Carry on.

112
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:18,941
Now, I know our last escape
attempt was a bit of a fiasco,

113
00:15:19,148 --> 00:15:21,257
But Mac and I have come
up with a brand-New plan.

114
00:15:21,294 --> 00:15:22,023
- Show 'em, Mac.
- Right.

115
00:15:23,065 --> 00:15:23,793
We tried going under the
wire and that didn't work.

116
00:15:26,689 --> 00:15:30,603
So, the plan is, we go over it.

117
00:15:31,104 --> 00:15:33,667
- This is us, right?

118
00:15:33,703 --> 00:15:36,193
We get in like this.

119
00:15:36,229 --> 00:15:40,143
Wind her up and... let her go!

120
00:15:44,518 --> 00:15:48,475
Good grief! The turnip's bought it!

121
00:15:50,267 --> 00:15:54,225
Farmer's coming!

122
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:01,847
Operation Cover-Up!

123
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:05,326
Whee!

124
00:16:05,362 --> 00:16:08,514
Ouch!

125
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:15,844
Hmm.

126
00:16:18,261 --> 00:16:22,094
Huh?

127
00:16:26,468 --> 00:16:30,222
- Mr. Tweedy!
- Ooh. Ouch.

128
00:16:30,258 --> 00:16:34,217
- Where are you?
- Ooh. It's all in your head.

129
00:16:34,299 --> 00:16:38,256
It's all in your head.
It's all in your head.

130
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:43,339
Think, everyone, think.
What haven't we tried yet?

131
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:45,301
Uh...

132
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,879
We haven't tried not trying to escape.

133
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:50,209
Hmm. That might work.

134
00:16:50,246 --> 00:16:52,467
What about Edwina?

135
00:16:52,503 --> 00:16:56,382
How many more empty nests will it take?

136
00:16:56,419 --> 00:17:00,377
Perhaps it wouldn't be empty if she'd spent
more time layin' and less time escapin'.

137
00:17:01,543 --> 00:17:03,590
So laying eggs all your life...

138
00:17:03,626 --> 00:17:06,209
And then getting plucked, stuffed
and roasted is good enough for you?

139
00:17:06,246 --> 00:17:08,379
It's a livin'.

140
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:11,255
You know what the problem is?

141
00:17:11,292 --> 00:17:15,249
The fences aren't just round the
farm. They're up here in your heads.

142
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:19,957
There's a better place out
there somewhere beyond that hill,

143
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:24,164
And it has wide open
spaces and lots of trees...

144
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:27,251
And grass.

145
00:17:27,287 --> 00:17:31,246
Can you imagine that? Cool, green grass.

146
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:35,500
- Who feeds us?
- We feed ourselves.

147
00:17:35,536 --> 00:17:37,832
- Well, where's the farm?
- There is no farm.

148
00:17:37,869 --> 00:17:41,618
- Then where does the farmer live?
- There is no farmer, Babs.

149
00:17:41,654 --> 00:17:45,367
- Is he on holiday?
- He isn't anywhere. Don't you get it?

150
00:17:45,575 --> 00:17:49,449
There's no morning head count, no
farmers, no dogs and coops and keys...

151
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:52,497
And no fences.

152
00:17:52,533 --> 00:17:56,491
In all my life I've never
heard such a fantastic...

153
00:17:57,531 --> 00:18:00,868
Load of tripe!

154
00:18:00,904 --> 00:18:03,035
Oh, face the facts, ducks.

155
00:18:03,072 --> 00:18:07,029
The chances of us gettin' out
of here are a million to one.

156
00:18:07,321 --> 00:18:11,277
Then there's still a chance.

157
00:18:31,732 --> 00:18:35,320
Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no. What am I doing?

158
00:18:35,356 --> 00:18:39,313
Who are you trying to fool?
You can't lead this bunch of...

159
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:43,938
Oh, heaven help us.

160
00:18:53,935 --> 00:18:57,519
Freedom!

161
00:18:57,555 --> 00:19:01,101
Huh?

162
00:19:13,807 --> 00:19:15,311
Whoa!

163
00:19:15,348 --> 00:19:19,305
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
You've been a wonderful audience.

164
00:19:20,138 --> 00:19:24,055
- Ouch!
- Oh, yes.

165
00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:39,138
That's it.

166
00:19:39,175 --> 00:19:41,676
Get him inside quickly.

167
00:19:48,257 --> 00:19:50,840
This is our way out of here.

168
00:19:50,876 --> 00:19:52,678
We'll make posters?

169
00:19:52,715 --> 00:19:56,672
No. What's on the poster, Babs.
What's on the poster. We'll fly out!

170
00:19:57,965 --> 00:20:01,923
He must be very important to have his
picture taken. What do you suppose he does?

171
00:20:02,088 --> 00:20:04,942
Isn't it obvious? He's a
professional flying rooster.

172
00:20:04,978 --> 00:20:07,795
He flies from farm to
farm, giving demonstrations.

173
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:10,508
- Do you suppose?
- Oh, absolutely.

174
00:20:10,545 --> 00:20:12,835
Not in the dark, no.
No, not in there. No.

175
00:20:12,872 --> 00:20:15,543
Get out. Good. Gotta get...

176
00:20:20,293 --> 00:20:23,541
Who are you? Where
am I? What's goin' on?

177
00:20:23,577 --> 00:20:25,747
Ouch! What happened to my wing?

178
00:20:25,783 --> 00:20:27,879
You took a rather nasty fall.

179
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:30,499
And sprained the anterior tendon
connecting your radius to your humerus.

180
00:20:30,535 --> 00:20:32,461
I gave it a wee bit of a tweak,
Jimmy, and wrapped her up.

181
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:34,123
Was that English?

182
00:20:34,124 --> 00:20:35,747
She said you sprained
your wing. She fixed it.

183
00:20:35,783 --> 00:20:39,663
- I made the bandage.
- I-I carried you in.

184
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,543
- Whoa. Whoa. Whoa! Whoa.

185
00:20:42,579 --> 00:20:46,496
Let's back up and start
from the top. Where am I?

186
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:49,870
You're right. How rude of
us. We're just very excit...

187
00:20:49,906 --> 00:20:51,949
This is a chicken farm.

188
00:20:51,985 --> 00:20:53,957
And we're the chickens.

189
00:20:53,994 --> 00:20:56,790
Yeah, with you so far.
Chicken farm, chickens...

190
00:20:56,826 --> 00:21:00,575
I don't like the look of this one.
His eyes are too close together.

191
00:21:00,611 --> 00:21:03,247
- Father, please.
- And he's a Yank!

192
00:21:03,283 --> 00:21:05,950
Easy, Pops. Cockfighting's
illegal where I come from.

193
00:21:05,986 --> 00:21:07,953
And where is that exactly?

194
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:11,031
Just a little place I call the land
of the free and the home of the brave.

195
00:21:11,068 --> 00:21:14,156
- Scotland!
- No! America.

196
00:21:14,193 --> 00:21:16,784
Oh! America.

197
00:21:16,821 --> 00:21:20,779
Poppycock. Pushy Americans. Always
showing up late for every war.

198
00:21:22,196 --> 00:21:26,153
Overpaid, oversexed and over here!

199
00:21:26,862 --> 00:21:28,699
What's eatin' Grandpa?

200
00:21:28,735 --> 00:21:31,157
Oh, don't mind him, Mister... Mister?

201
00:21:31,194 --> 00:21:34,944
The name's Rocky. Rocky the Rhode
Island Red. Rhodes for short.

202
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:38,734
- Rocky Rhodes?
- Catchy, ain't it?

203
00:21:38,771 --> 00:21:41,733
Um, Mr. Rhodes, is this you?

204
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:45,613
Uh, who wants to know?

205
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:47,779
A group of rather desperate chickens.

206
00:21:47,816 --> 00:21:51,774
You see, if it is you, then you just
might be the answer to our prayers.

207
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:59,104
Well, then, call me a miracle,
doll face, 'cause that's me.

208
00:22:01,062 --> 00:22:03,817
And what brings you
to England, Mr. Rhodes?

209
00:22:03,853 --> 00:22:07,354
Why, all the beautiful
English chicks, of course.

210
00:22:07,391 --> 00:22:10,441
Give over!

211
00:22:10,477 --> 00:22:12,816
You see, I'm a traveler by nature.

212
00:22:12,852 --> 00:22:16,809
I did that whole barnyard thing for a
while, but I couldn't really get into it.

213
00:22:17,017 --> 00:22:20,273
Hi. How are you? Nope.

214
00:22:20,309 --> 00:22:22,354
The open road. That's more my style.

215
00:22:22,391 --> 00:22:26,307
Yep, just give me a pack on my back
and point me where the wind blows.

216
00:22:26,682 --> 00:22:30,223
In fact, you know what
they call me back home?

217
00:22:30,259 --> 00:22:33,763
You're gonna love this.
The Lone Free Ranger.

218
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,644
- Ooh!
- Isn't that great?

219
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,387
- I knew it was possible.
- Oh, it's possible, all right.

220
00:22:39,424 --> 00:22:41,309
- I knew the answer would come.
- Amen!

221
00:22:41,346 --> 00:22:45,303
We're all going to fly over that fence, and
Mr. Rhodes is going to show us how, right?

222
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:50,219
That's... What? Did you say "fly"?

223
00:22:50,594 --> 00:22:52,865
- You can teach us.
- No, I can't.

224
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:56,931
Listen. Shh...
You hear that?

225
00:22:56,968 --> 00:23:00,926
That's the open road calling my name,
and I was born to answer that call. Bye.

226
00:23:01,633 --> 00:23:04,929
He must have very good hearing.

227
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:08,924
Okay, okay, where's
the exit? Ah, this way.

228
00:23:09,341 --> 00:23:13,298
Mr. Rhodes, um, perhaps I didn't
explain our situation properly.

229
00:23:13,548 --> 00:23:15,885
We lay eggs day in and day out,

230
00:23:15,922 --> 00:23:18,509
And when we can't lay
any more, they kill us.

231
00:23:18,546 --> 00:23:22,504
It's a cruel world, doll face.
You might as well get used to it.

232
00:23:22,835 --> 00:23:26,335
Which part of "they kill
us" do you not understand?

233
00:23:26,372 --> 00:23:28,425
I got my own set of
problems to worry about.

234
00:23:28,461 --> 00:23:30,709
Besides, this birdcage can't
be that hard to bust out of.

235
00:23:30,746 --> 00:23:33,257
In fact, watch me.

236
00:23:33,294 --> 00:23:37,251
It's not so hard to get one
chicken out of here or even two,

237
00:23:37,793 --> 00:23:40,422
But this is about all of us.

238
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:44,332
- All of you?
- That's what I've been trying to tell you.

239
00:23:44,369 --> 00:23:46,296
Wait a minute. Let me get this straight.

240
00:23:46,332 --> 00:23:49,915
You want to get every chicken in this
place out of here at the same time?

241
00:23:49,951 --> 00:23:53,419
- Of course.
- You're certifiable.

242
00:23:53,455 --> 00:23:55,912
You can't pull off a stunt
like that. That's suicide.

243
00:23:55,949 --> 00:23:57,502
Where there's a will, there's a way.

244
00:23:57,538 --> 00:23:59,496
Couldn't agree more. I
will be leaving that way.

245
00:23:59,497 --> 00:24:01,454
But...

246
00:24:01,621 --> 00:24:03,249
- Mr. Rhodes, please...
- I'm the type of guy

247
00:24:03,285 --> 00:24:07,243
That likes to roam
around I'm never in one...

248
00:24:25,782 --> 00:24:29,405
So that's it. You're from the circus.

249
00:24:29,442 --> 00:24:31,368
Shh!

250
00:24:31,404 --> 00:24:33,404
You're on the run, aren't you?

251
00:24:33,441 --> 00:24:35,451
You wanna keep it down?

252
00:24:35,487 --> 00:24:38,383
I'm trying to lay low here.

253
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:41,242
I should turn you in right now.

254
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:45,152
- You wouldn't. Would you?
- Give me one reason why I shouldn't.

255
00:24:45,188 --> 00:24:48,610
Because I'm... cute?

256
00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:54,197
Hey, hey, hey! What kind
of crazy chick are you?

257
00:24:54,233 --> 00:24:57,442
- Do you know what'll happen if he finds me?
- It's a cruel world.

258
00:24:57,478 --> 00:24:59,447
I just decided. I don't like you.

259
00:24:59,483 --> 00:25:02,317
I just decided. I don't
care. Now, show us how to fly.

260
00:25:02,353 --> 00:25:05,106
- With this wing?
- Teach us then.

261
00:25:05,143 --> 00:25:06,445
No!

262
00:25:06,481 --> 00:25:09,459
He's valuable, you say?

263
00:25:09,496 --> 00:25:12,401
- Sure.
- Get the torch.

264
00:25:12,437 --> 00:25:15,772
Now you listen here, sister.
I'm not going back to that life.

265
00:25:15,808 --> 00:25:18,604
I'm a Lone Free Ranger.
Emphasis on free!

266
00:25:18,641 --> 00:25:21,520
And that's what we want. Freedom!

267
00:25:24,269 --> 00:25:27,144
Fancy that.
They're coming this way.

268
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,497
Oh, oh, no. No. Oh,
no. They're on to me.

269
00:25:29,533 --> 00:25:32,143
Teach us to fly and we'll hide you.

270
00:25:31,761 --> 00:25:34,085
And if I don't?

271
00:25:34,122 --> 00:25:37,600
Was your father by any chance a vulture?

272
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:41,556
Do we have a deal?

273
00:25:59,095 --> 00:26:01,053
Time to make good on that deal, doll...

274
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:04,011
The name is Ginger.

275
00:26:20,758 --> 00:26:23,179
- Comfortable?
- Not really.

276
00:26:23,216 --> 00:26:27,173
- Maybe this will help.
- Nice hideout.

277
00:26:28,256 --> 00:26:30,509
Ouch. I had more room in my egg.

278
00:26:30,546 --> 00:26:34,213
We've held up our end of the
deal. Tomorrow you hold up yours.

279
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:36,218
- What deal?
- The flying!

280
00:26:36,254 --> 00:26:38,336
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right,
right, right. Don't worry.

281
00:26:38,373 --> 00:26:40,336
I'll teach you everything I know.

282
00:26:40,373 --> 00:26:43,461
Now, which bunk is mine?

283
00:26:46,251 --> 00:26:49,797
Absolutely outrageous!

284
00:26:49,833 --> 00:26:52,834
Asking a senior officer
to share his quarters...

285
00:26:52,871 --> 00:26:55,497
And with a noncommissioned
Yank, no less.

286
00:26:55,533 --> 00:26:58,641
- Why, back in my day, I'd never...
- Hey!

287
00:26:58,677 --> 00:27:01,712
You weren't exactly
my first choice either.

288
00:27:01,749 --> 00:27:04,044
And scoot over. Your wing's
on my side of the bunk.

289
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,038
Your side of the bunk? The whole
bunk is my side of the bunk!

290
00:27:08,706 --> 00:27:12,662
Just... What's that
smell? Is that your breath?

291
00:27:13,288 --> 00:27:17,245
It's absolutely outrageous.

292
00:27:22,035 --> 00:27:25,417
So you wanna fly, huh?

293
00:27:25,453 --> 00:27:29,409
Well, it ain't gonna be easy, and it
ain't gonna happen overnight either.

294
00:27:29,446 --> 00:27:31,451
You see, flying takes three things.

295
00:27:31,487 --> 00:27:35,408
Hard work, perseverance and...

296
00:27:35,741 --> 00:27:38,871
- Hard work.
- You said hard work twice!

297
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:42,823
That's because it takes twice
as much work as perseverance.

298
00:27:43,781 --> 00:27:47,738
Codswallop!

299
00:27:48,905 --> 00:27:52,821
Now, the most important thing
is we have to work as a team,

300
00:27:54,112 --> 00:27:58,070
Which means... you do
everything I tell you.

301
00:28:00,195 --> 00:28:04,152
Right! Let's rock and roll.

302
00:28:11,192 --> 00:28:14,275
- Oh. Oh, oh.
- Oh. Oh, oh.

303
00:28:42,269 --> 00:28:46,226
Mrs. Tweedy! The chickens are...

304
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:49,897
Pecking?

305
00:28:49,933 --> 00:28:53,892
And left, two, three.
And right, two, three.

306
00:28:54,892 --> 00:28:58,807
And... stop right there. Oh, yeah, down.

307
00:28:59,057 --> 00:29:02,766
Down. Yeah, yeah, make little
circles. That's it. Faster.

308
00:29:02,802 --> 00:29:06,723
Faster. Oh, yes. Perfect.

309
00:29:07,887 --> 00:29:11,845
Oh, that's the spot.

310
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:24,009
I thought you were going
to teach us how to fly.

311
00:29:24,046 --> 00:29:26,640
That's what I'm doing.

312
00:29:26,676 --> 00:29:29,799
Isn't there usually
some flapping involved?

313
00:29:29,835 --> 00:29:33,132
Hey, do I tell you how to lay eggs?

314
00:29:33,169 --> 00:29:35,679
Relax. We're making progress.

315
00:29:35,716 --> 00:29:39,673
Really? I can't help feeling
we're going around in circles.

316
00:29:41,048 --> 00:29:45,005
What the... Hey! Cut it
out! You're making me dizzy.

317
00:29:45,173 --> 00:29:47,884
I think they're ready to fly now.

318
00:29:47,921 --> 00:29:51,879
Good, because they
certainly can't walk anymore.

319
00:29:53,045 --> 00:29:56,960
Up and at 'em, gals. Let's flap.

320
00:30:00,709 --> 00:30:04,667
Watch, Fetcher. Let's see if old
Attila the Hen has come to her senses.

321
00:30:12,042 --> 00:30:15,999
It's raining hen!

322
00:30:19,205 --> 00:30:21,913
- What's this caper, love?
- We're flying.

323
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:23,877
Obviously.

324
00:30:23,913 --> 00:30:27,872
- Flippin' hell. Look at this, Fetch.
- They're gonna kill themselves.

325
00:30:29,121 --> 00:30:33,078
- Wanna watch?
- Yeah, all right.

326
00:30:37,452 --> 00:30:39,909
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

327
00:30:39,946 --> 00:30:42,330
- Ahh!
- Ahh!

328
00:30:42,367 --> 00:30:46,325
Hey! Careful of those eggs!

329
00:30:50,824 --> 00:30:54,781
Sunny-Side up.

330
00:30:55,824 --> 00:30:59,741
Now they're over easy!

331
00:30:59,865 --> 00:31:03,697
Definitely scrambled.

332
00:31:03,733 --> 00:31:05,659
Go! Go! Go!

333
00:31:05,696 --> 00:31:08,529
Go, go, go, go! Go!

334
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:11,361
Poultry in motion!

335
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,692
Birds of a feather flop together.

336
00:31:33,482 --> 00:31:35,486
Great work, ladies. Great work!

337
00:31:35,523 --> 00:31:38,230
The pain you're feeling
is a good thing. It's good.

338
00:31:38,267 --> 00:31:40,902
Pain is your friend, okay?
It's a positive thing.

339
00:31:40,938 --> 00:31:44,688
Just keep the faith there, uh... What
was your name? Agnes! You'll get there.

340
00:31:44,725 --> 00:31:46,651
Ducky, I think you flew four feet today.

341
00:31:46,687 --> 00:31:50,604
Right, four feet! From
the roof to the ground.

342
00:31:50,895 --> 00:31:53,478
It's all part of the process,
ladies. Nothing to worry about.

343
00:31:53,515 --> 00:31:55,769
Ya cheese-Eating little...

344
00:31:56,847 --> 00:31:58,731
Whoa!

345
00:31:58,768 --> 00:32:01,606
That doesn't sound good. Ha, ha, ha.

346
00:32:01,643 --> 00:32:04,434
Okay, the ground's
shaking. Are we worried?

347
00:32:04,471 --> 00:32:08,349
Are we worried?

348
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:16,474
The circus. Quick. Hide me.

349
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:18,561
- Hide me.
- Come on.

350
00:32:18,598 --> 00:32:22,513
One isn't awarded a medal like this
for flapping about like a lunatic, what.

351
00:32:23,722 --> 00:32:26,975
Now, see here! This is
an officer's quarters.

352
00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:29,553
- Quick. In here.
- Get out of here immediately, sir!

353
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:31,808
Give it a rest, Pops.

354
00:32:31,845 --> 00:32:35,802
Out of here! I shall have you
on a charge within the week.

355
00:33:13,835 --> 00:33:16,001
Cheers, mate.

356
00:33:21,001 --> 00:33:24,958
It's all in your head.
It's all in your head.

357
00:33:25,332 --> 00:33:29,249
It's all in your head.

358
00:33:30,832 --> 00:33:33,628
Ooh!

359
00:33:33,665 --> 00:33:37,330
What... What... What's all this then?

360
00:33:37,367 --> 00:33:39,585
This is our future, Mr. Tweedy.

361
00:33:39,622 --> 00:33:43,580
No more wasting time with petty egg
collection and minuscule profits.

362
00:33:43,872 --> 00:33:47,829
No more eggs? But we've
always been egg farmers.

363
00:33:47,953 --> 00:33:51,327
Me father and his father and all
their fathers. They was always...

364
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:54,220
Poor! Worthless. Nothings.

365
00:33:54,256 --> 00:33:57,040
But all that's about to change.

366
00:33:57,076 --> 00:34:00,658
This will take Tweedy's
farm out of the dark ages...

367
00:34:00,695 --> 00:34:04,572
And into full-Scale
automated production.

368
00:34:04,608 --> 00:34:08,450
- Melisha Tweedy will
be poor no longer.

369
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:12,079
Ooh!

370
00:34:12,116 --> 00:34:16,073
I'll put it together then, shall I?

371
00:34:21,029 --> 00:34:23,285
This isn't good, Mac.

372
00:34:23,322 --> 00:34:27,279
Whatever's in those boxes is for us,
and I don't think it's softer hay.

373
00:34:27,446 --> 00:34:29,907
Aye, hen. And I hate
to be the voice of doom,

374
00:34:29,944 --> 00:34:33,860
But I've been calculating my figures, and
I just don't think we're built for flyin'.

375
00:34:34,526 --> 00:34:38,318
But I saw him. He flew
in over that fence.

376
00:34:38,354 --> 00:34:40,281
Aye, aye, I believe you,

377
00:34:40,318 --> 00:34:44,275
But if we could just see it for
ourselves, that may answer some questions.

378
00:34:44,692 --> 00:34:46,947
You're right. I'm sorry.

379
00:34:46,983 --> 00:34:49,486
We've been at this all week,
and we're getting nowhere.

380
00:34:49,523 --> 00:34:53,480
If his wing were better, he could...
Oh! I'll have a word with him.

381
00:35:00,813 --> 00:35:02,608
Where is he?

382
00:35:02,645 --> 00:35:06,644
They didn't give me this
medal for being a Yank nanny.

383
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,978
A simple "I don't know" would suffice.

384
00:35:09,015 --> 00:35:12,266
Beware of that one, young Ginger.

385
00:35:12,302 --> 00:35:15,481
That Yank is not to be trusted.

386
00:35:15,518 --> 00:35:19,475
That Yank is our ticket out of here.

387
00:35:19,808 --> 00:35:23,766
And the pig says to the horse,
"Hey, fella, why the long face?"

388
00:35:25,725 --> 00:35:28,765
Oh, oh, look, look.

389
00:35:28,801 --> 00:35:31,866
Oh. Cocktail!

390
00:35:31,902 --> 00:35:34,930
Give over!

391
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:41,847
So, um, anyway...

392
00:35:42,928 --> 00:35:46,886
Remember those flying tips
tomorrow. They're very important.

393
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:49,927
Keep thinking those flighty thoughts.

394
00:35:49,963 --> 00:35:52,307
Oh, yeah.

395
00:35:52,344 --> 00:35:54,306
They're swell chicks. They really are.

396
00:35:54,343 --> 00:35:58,301
Look at what Babs made me. A beak
warmer. Isn't that the cutest?

397
00:35:59,383 --> 00:36:03,049
And that Bunty. She
really packs a punch.

398
00:36:03,085 --> 00:36:05,596
Is there a problem here?

399
00:36:05,632 --> 00:36:07,761
- Have we flown over that fence?
- Not quite.

400
00:36:07,798 --> 00:36:09,548
Then there's a problem.

401
00:36:09,549 --> 00:36:11,298
Good things come to
those who wait, doll face.

402
00:36:11,334 --> 00:36:15,254
Ginger!

403
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:22,899
Okay, how long did it take you?

404
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,254
To do what?

405
00:36:24,291 --> 00:36:26,218
To learn how to fly.

406
00:36:26,254 --> 00:36:29,253
Apples and oranges, baby
doll. I'm gifted. They're not.

407
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:31,756
You can't compare the two, okay?

408
00:36:31,793 --> 00:36:33,959
The point is, these things take time.

409
00:36:33,996 --> 00:36:36,090
Which we are rapidly running out of.

410
00:36:36,126 --> 00:36:37,191
We haven't even lifted
off the ground. Why?

411
00:36:37,192 --> 00:36:38,256
Thrust.

412
00:36:38,293 --> 00:36:42,250
I went over my calculations, and I figured
the key element we're missing is thrust.

413
00:36:46,207 --> 00:36:48,253
L
- I didn't get a word of that.

414
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:50,248
Thrust! Other birds
like ducks and geese,

415
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:52,205
When they take off, what
do they have? Thrust.

416
00:36:52,705 --> 00:36:55,584
I swear she ain't usin' real words.

417
00:36:55,621 --> 00:36:58,584
- She said we need more thrust.
- Oh, thrust.

418
00:36:58,621 --> 00:37:00,599
Well, of course, we need thrust.
Thrust and flying are like this.

419
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,579
That's flying and that's thrust.

420
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:07,224
- Would you excuse us?
- Aye.

421
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:10,291
Ah, the wing, the wing, the wing.

422
00:37:10,327 --> 00:37:13,701
If we don't see some results by tomorrow,
the deal is off, and you're on your own.

423
00:37:13,737 --> 00:37:17,076
No more hiding. The farmers will find
you, and it's back to the circus, flyboy.

424
00:37:17,783 --> 00:37:21,741
You're the first chick I ever
met with the shell still on.

425
00:37:23,242 --> 00:37:27,198
Sleep tight, angel face.
The Rock's on the case.

426
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:31,614
Ginger!

427
00:37:31,651 --> 00:37:34,952
Whew!

428
00:37:34,988 --> 00:37:38,946
Cock-A-Doodle-Doo!
What, what.

429
00:37:41,611 --> 00:37:45,116
- Oh, it was a beaut, guv'nor.
- Hmm?

430
00:37:45,152 --> 00:37:48,573
A fine piece of work,
if I do say so meself.

431
00:37:48,609 --> 00:37:51,422
- I say so meself too.
- I wish I could have seen it.

432
00:37:51,458 --> 00:37:54,234
We slipped into the farmer's
room, all quiet like.

433
00:37:54,271 --> 00:37:57,793
- Like a fish.
- Yeah, and we...

434
00:37:57,829 --> 00:38:01,316
"Like a fish"? You stupid Norbert.

435
00:38:01,774 --> 00:38:04,072
Anyway, guv, here it is.

436
00:38:04,108 --> 00:38:07,028
- El merchandiso.
- That's Spanish.

437
00:38:07,064 --> 00:38:11,023
- What are these two crooks doing here?
- So, you know each other.

438
00:38:11,106 --> 00:38:13,360
She don't think we're valuable.

439
00:38:13,397 --> 00:38:16,110
Guys, you are without
a doubt the sneakiest,

440
00:38:16,147 --> 00:38:19,437
Most light-Fingered thieving
parasites I've ever met.

441
00:38:19,474 --> 00:38:22,729
- Oh, don't, don't. Stop it.
- I've gone bright red.

442
00:38:23,185 --> 00:38:25,148
So, uh, how about them eggs?

443
00:38:25,184 --> 00:38:27,227
- Eggs? Don't tell me you promised them...
- Yep!

444
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:30,744
Promised them every
egg I lay this month.

445
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:33,355
And when can we expect
the first installment?

446
00:38:33,392 --> 00:38:37,349
I'm brewing one up as we speak,
guys. I'll keep you posted.

447
00:38:38,307 --> 00:38:41,017
Pleasure doing business with you, sir.

448
00:38:41,053 --> 00:38:44,729
Sucker.

449
00:38:44,766 --> 00:38:47,020
- What?
- You've lied to them.

450
00:38:47,056 --> 00:38:51,014
I didn't lie, doll face. I
just... omitted certain truths.

451
00:38:51,222 --> 00:38:53,185
I'll give them exactly what I promised.

452
00:38:53,221 --> 00:38:55,972
- Which is nothing.
- Which is what I'll give them.

453
00:38:56,008 --> 00:38:59,137
And what will you give us?

454
00:38:59,174 --> 00:39:03,094
Thrust!

455
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:07,177
You okay, sweetheart? Good, good.

456
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,181
Now this is just a little helper.

457
00:39:10,218 --> 00:39:13,133
Something to get you going.
It's a thrust exercise.

458
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:16,049
- The tension's killing me.
- It's gonna kill her!

459
00:39:16,085 --> 00:39:19,966
- Release!
- Whoa!

460
00:39:22,923 --> 00:39:26,880
Come on! Flap!

461
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:32,213
You can do it. Flap, flap, flap!

462
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:39,086
Yes, yes, yes!

463
00:39:40,004 --> 00:39:43,253
Is that your first offense?

464
00:39:53,458 --> 00:39:57,417
Oops.

465
00:39:58,416 --> 00:40:01,956
Roll call! I haven't laid any eggs.

466
00:40:02,038 --> 00:40:04,671
- Hide me.
- Three days and not one.

467
00:40:04,707 --> 00:40:05,935
Oh, no!

468
00:40:05,936 --> 00:40:07,164
- Why didn't you tell us, Babs?
- Hide me!

469
00:40:07,201 --> 00:40:09,289
We've been so busy with the flying...

470
00:40:09,326 --> 00:40:11,162
- They're coming!
- Hide me!

471
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:13,746
Hide yourself!

472
00:40:21,411 --> 00:40:25,369
Oh!

473
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:17,899
Double their food rations, Mr. Tweedy.

474
00:41:17,935 --> 00:41:20,898
I want them all as fat as this one.

475
00:41:21,274 --> 00:41:24,860
Oh!

476
00:41:24,897 --> 00:41:28,855
All of me life flashed before me eyes!

477
00:41:29,063 --> 00:41:33,026
It was really borin'.

478
00:41:33,062 --> 00:41:37,020
Chicken feed. My favorite!

479
00:41:37,311 --> 00:41:39,186
Wait. Wait.

480
00:41:42,853 --> 00:41:45,816
Ooh!

481
00:41:45,852 --> 00:41:49,768
No. Wait!

482
00:41:50,892 --> 00:41:54,850
Babs, please! Bunty! Stop it! Wait!

483
00:41:55,057 --> 00:41:59,014
Stop!

484
00:42:01,931 --> 00:42:05,727
Stop it!

485
00:42:05,763 --> 00:42:09,721
Something is wrong
here. Can't you see that?

486
00:42:10,555 --> 00:42:12,518
Strange boxes arrive in the barn.

487
00:42:12,554 --> 00:42:14,846
Babs stops laying, but they
don't take her to the chop,

488
00:42:14,882 --> 00:42:17,182
And now they're giving us extra food.

489
00:42:17,219 --> 00:42:20,802
Don't you see what's happening?
They're fattening us up.

490
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:24,552
- They're going to kill us all.

491
00:42:24,588 --> 00:42:28,509
Whoa, whoa! Heavy alert.

492
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,218
- She didn't mean that, gals.
- Do you mind?

493
00:42:31,254 --> 00:42:33,388
Keep eating. Save some for me.

494
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:36,845
What are you doing? How
dare you! Let go of me!

495
00:42:36,881 --> 00:42:40,799
Listen. I've met some hard-Boiled eggs in
my day, but I'd say you're about 20 minutes.

496
00:42:42,131 --> 00:42:45,213
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means you got to lighten up.

497
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:47,219
Over in America, we have this rule.

498
00:42:47,255 --> 00:42:50,692
If you want to motivate
someone, don't mention death.

499
00:42:50,728 --> 00:42:53,845
Funny. Over here, the rule
is: Always tell the truth.

500
00:42:53,881 --> 00:42:56,926
That's been working like
a real charm, hasn't it?

501
00:42:56,962 --> 00:43:00,585
Here's some free advice. You want them to
perform? Tell them what they wanna hear.

502
00:43:00,622 --> 00:43:03,131
You mean lie.

503
00:43:03,168 --> 00:43:06,918
Here we go again. You
know what your problem is?

504
00:43:06,954 --> 00:43:09,005
You're... difficult.

505
00:43:09,042 --> 00:43:12,958
Why? Because I'm honest? I
care about what happens to them,

506
00:43:13,208 --> 00:43:16,749
Something I wouldn't expect a lone
free ranger to know anything about.

507
00:43:16,785 --> 00:43:19,373
If this is the way you show it,
I hope you never care about me.

508
00:43:19,409 --> 00:43:23,330
- I can assure you, I
never will. - Good! - Fine!

509
00:44:11,445 --> 00:44:13,408
What's all this?

510
00:44:13,445 --> 00:44:17,403
Well, here she is. Ask
and you shall receive.

511
00:44:17,861 --> 00:44:21,527
- That's biblical.
- That's real craftsmanship is what it is.

512
00:44:21,563 --> 00:44:24,460
- Solid as a rock.
- Ooh!

513
00:44:24,497 --> 00:44:27,322
- It's supposed to do that.

514
00:44:27,358 --> 00:44:31,316
- It's perfect, guys.
- And how's that egg coming?

515
00:44:31,899 --> 00:44:35,232
This is a double yolker.

516
00:44:43,354 --> 00:44:45,813
I don't see what
this has to do with...

517
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:48,151
You will.

518
00:44:48,187 --> 00:44:50,275
We've been workin' too hard.

519
00:44:50,311 --> 00:44:53,020
Time to kick back a bit,
shake those tail feathers.

520
00:44:53,056 --> 00:44:56,810
Look at him. Nellypodging
around like a...

521
00:44:56,847 --> 00:44:59,148
Oh, good heavens. What's happenin'?

522
00:44:59,184 --> 00:45:03,143
That's called a beat, sister.
Feel it pulsing through your body?

523
00:45:03,809 --> 00:45:07,121
Oh, yes. Pulsing. Fancy that.

524
00:45:07,157 --> 00:45:10,774
Hey, well, then go with it, baby.

525
00:45:10,810 --> 00:45:14,391
Oh, my. Look! I'm going with it!

526
00:45:15,182 --> 00:45:17,977
Bunty, what's got into you?

527
00:45:18,013 --> 00:45:20,180
Same thing that's got
into you apparently.

528
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:22,811
Flip, flop, fly

529
00:45:22,848 --> 00:45:25,137
- I don't care if I die
- Just go with the flow, gal!

530
00:45:25,174 --> 00:45:27,513
- Flip, flop, fly
- Let it go!

531
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:30,142
I don't care if I die

532
00:45:30,178 --> 00:45:33,350
Don't ever leave me
Don't ever say good-Bye

533
00:45:33,386 --> 00:45:36,759
Now, see here. I don't
recall authorizing a hop.

534
00:45:36,796 --> 00:45:38,845
Oh, shut up and dance.

535
00:45:38,881 --> 00:45:42,759
Oh! Oh!

536
00:45:44,467 --> 00:45:48,424
What are you sobbing about,
you nancy?

537
00:45:49,466 --> 00:45:53,423
Little moments like this, mate. It's
what makes the job all worthwhile.

538
00:45:58,463 --> 00:46:02,380
Wanna dance?

539
00:46:02,506 --> 00:46:04,469
Yeah, all right.

540
00:46:04,505 --> 00:46:08,046
Now, give me one more kiss
Hold it a long, long time

541
00:46:08,082 --> 00:46:09,758
Huh?

542
00:46:09,795 --> 00:46:13,710
Give me one more kiss
Hold it a long, long time

543
00:46:15,086 --> 00:46:17,544
Love me, baby, till the
feelin' hits my head like wine

544
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:19,669
So fine So glad you're mine

545
00:46:19,705 --> 00:46:21,923
Flip, flop, fly

546
00:46:21,959 --> 00:46:24,755
I don't care if I die

547
00:46:24,792 --> 00:46:28,749
Flip, flop, fly I don't care if I die

548
00:46:29,041 --> 00:46:32,998
Don't ever leave me
Don't ever say good-Bye

549
00:46:33,873 --> 00:46:37,628
Don't ever leave me
Don't ever say good-Bye

550
00:46:37,664 --> 00:46:41,622
Yeah, don't ever leave
me Don't ever say good-Bye

551
00:46:41,912 --> 00:46:44,830
- Yeah

552
00:46:47,703 --> 00:46:51,661
Did ya see that? I flew!

553
00:46:52,495 --> 00:46:54,957
Attagirl, Babsy. Attagirl.

554
00:46:54,994 --> 00:46:58,659
- Oh! Your wing. It's better.
- Well...

555
00:46:58,696 --> 00:47:01,260
- How about that?
- Fantastic.

556
00:47:01,297 --> 00:47:04,395
You can fly for us tomorrow.

557
00:47:04,431 --> 00:47:07,492
Uh, uh, yeah, so it seems.

558
00:47:07,528 --> 00:47:09,121
I flew! I flew!

559
00:47:09,157 --> 00:47:12,995
Looks like I owe you an apology.

560
00:47:13,031 --> 00:47:16,614
I didn't think you cared
about us, but after all this...

561
00:47:16,651 --> 00:47:19,402
Well, it seems I was wrong.

562
00:47:19,438 --> 00:47:22,118
Hey, easy, Miss Hard-Boiled.

563
00:47:22,154 --> 00:47:24,612
I might think you're turning soft.

564
00:47:29,071 --> 00:47:33,028
Uh, listen, there's
something I got to tell ya.

565
00:47:33,653 --> 00:47:35,860
I...

566
00:47:41,401 --> 00:47:42,858
No. You'd better wait here.

567
00:48:07,145 --> 00:48:11,103
Ooh, that's champion,
that is. What is it?

568
00:48:11,478 --> 00:48:14,310
It's a pie machine, you idiot.

569
00:48:14,346 --> 00:48:17,143
Chickens go in, pies come out.

570
00:48:17,179 --> 00:48:19,597
Ooh! What kind of pies?

571
00:48:19,633 --> 00:48:21,980
- Apple.
- My favorite!

572
00:48:22,017 --> 00:48:25,975
Chicken pies, you great
lummox! Imagine it.

573
00:48:27,307 --> 00:48:30,391
In less than a fortnight,
every grocers' in the county...

574
00:48:30,427 --> 00:48:33,470
Will be stocked with box upon box...

575
00:48:33,506 --> 00:48:36,513
Of Mrs. Tweedy's Homemade Chicken Pies.

576
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:38,186
Just Missus?

577
00:48:38,223 --> 00:48:41,346
Woman's touch. Makes the
public feel more comfortable.

578
00:48:41,382 --> 00:48:44,768
Oh, right. How does it work?

579
00:48:44,804 --> 00:48:48,719
Get me a chicken and I'll show you.

580
00:48:49,011 --> 00:48:51,635
I know just the one.

581
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:58,676
I've got a score to settle with you.

582
00:48:58,801 --> 00:49:02,759
Bloomin' heck! They've got Ginger!

583
00:49:06,007 --> 00:49:09,966
We mustn't panic.
We mustn't panic!

584
00:49:10,423 --> 00:49:12,385
Quiet there!

585
00:49:12,422 --> 00:49:16,380
Quiet, I say! Let's have
some discipline, what, what.

586
00:49:16,588 --> 00:49:20,379
The enemy has taken a prisoner.
This calls for retaliation!

587
00:49:20,416 --> 00:49:23,758
- Retaliation!
- What's going on? What's happening?

588
00:49:23,795 --> 00:49:27,752
They got Ginger, Mr. Rhodes.
They're taking her to the chop!

589
00:49:28,002 --> 00:49:31,960
Well, what are you waiting for,
laddie? Fly over there. Save her!

590
00:49:32,334 --> 00:49:36,292
Of course... No, no! No,
that's just what they'd expect.

591
00:49:36,543 --> 00:49:39,084
But I say we give them the
old element of surprise.

592
00:49:39,121 --> 00:49:41,851
And catch Jerry with his trousers down.

593
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:44,582
I like the sound of
that. What's the plan?

594
00:49:44,619 --> 00:49:46,871
The plan... The plan.

595
00:49:46,907 --> 00:49:49,085
The plan... Uh, Babs!

596
00:49:49,122 --> 00:49:53,080
Give me that thing.
Bunty, give me a boost.

597
00:50:03,996 --> 00:50:05,958
Whoa.

598
00:50:05,995 --> 00:50:08,536
Look at the size of that thing.

599
00:50:12,284 --> 00:50:15,248
Oh, no!

600
00:50:15,284 --> 00:50:18,471
Chickens go in,

601
00:50:18,507 --> 00:50:21,658
Pies come out.

602
00:50:23,116 --> 00:50:25,037
Chicken pies.

603
00:50:25,074 --> 00:50:27,032
Not... Not apple pies.

604
00:50:27,069 --> 00:50:30,988
Chicken!

605
00:50:35,988 --> 00:50:38,300
Oh, great. Brilliant!

606
00:50:38,336 --> 00:50:40,910
- Yo, baby doll!
- Rocky!

607
00:50:40,947 --> 00:50:43,450
- I'm coming!
- Hurry!

608
00:50:43,486 --> 00:50:46,158
- I'm still coming!
- Come on!

609
00:50:46,195 --> 00:50:50,152
- Stop this thing!
- I'm gettin' there!

610
00:50:52,110 --> 00:50:54,276
Oh, shoot!

611
00:50:54,312 --> 00:50:56,406
Rocky!

612
00:50:56,443 --> 00:50:59,400
I'll be down before you can say...

613
00:50:59,436 --> 00:51:01,107
Mixed vegetables!

614
00:51:01,144 --> 00:51:03,689
Aaaah!

615
00:51:05,732 --> 00:51:08,273
Aaah! Ohh!

616
00:51:10,689 --> 00:51:14,604
Whoa-Ohh-Ohh-Ohh!

617
00:51:20,521 --> 00:51:22,457
Whoa-Ohh-Ohh!

618
00:51:22,494 --> 00:51:24,358
D
- Oh! Get it?

619
00:51:24,395 --> 00:51:27,081
- Dough!
- I'm stuck!

620
00:51:27,118 --> 00:51:29,768
Nothing to it. Oops.

621
00:51:38,266 --> 00:51:42,224
Ohh! Oh!

622
00:51:45,139 --> 00:51:49,098
Hang on!

623
00:51:51,348 --> 00:51:55,347
Look out!

624
00:51:57,554 --> 00:52:01,512
Whoa!

625
00:52:08,219 --> 00:52:12,176
Hey! Aha!

626
00:52:16,342 --> 00:52:20,257
Yes!

627
00:52:25,674 --> 00:52:27,673
Oh, it's like an oven in here.

628
00:52:36,754 --> 00:52:38,552
Come on!

629
00:52:38,588 --> 00:52:42,087
Wait up! I'm com...

630
00:52:42,124 --> 00:52:44,854
Don't leave...

631
00:52:44,891 --> 00:52:47,585
Get over to the...

632
00:52:56,625 --> 00:53:00,582
The door! Come on!

633
00:53:22,495 --> 00:53:25,702
She's gonna blow! Run!

634
00:53:27,408 --> 00:53:30,248
Huh?

635
00:53:30,284 --> 00:53:32,742
What did you do, you great pudding?

636
00:53:32,778 --> 00:53:36,699
I didn't do 'owt!

637
00:53:43,241 --> 00:53:47,198
- Turn it off!
- It won't turn off!

638
00:54:10,276 --> 00:54:13,567
- Ouch!
- We've got to show the others. Come on.

639
00:54:22,231 --> 00:54:24,563
Look! I fixed it!

640
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:26,397
Huh?

641
00:54:29,146 --> 00:54:32,195
- Chicken pies?
- Ohh! - Oh, no!

642
00:54:32,231 --> 00:54:35,230
- Yes, but...
- I don't want to be a pie.

643
00:54:35,267 --> 00:54:38,442
I don't like gravy.

644
00:54:38,478 --> 00:54:41,894
Ladies, please. Let's
not lose our heads.

645
00:54:41,930 --> 00:54:45,851
Lose our heads?

646
00:54:51,809 --> 00:54:55,808
What I meant to say was, Rocky sabotaged
the machine and bought us more time.

647
00:54:55,845 --> 00:54:57,771
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

648
00:54:57,807 --> 00:55:01,014
And better still, he's
going to fly for us tomorrow.

649
00:55:01,051 --> 00:55:04,223
And once we've seen
how's it done, we'll get it.

650
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:06,185
So don't worry,

651
00:55:06,222 --> 00:55:10,137
Because tomorrow everything's
going to go much, much smoother.

652
00:55:19,345 --> 00:55:22,677
All right, Pops, what did I do now?

653
00:55:22,713 --> 00:55:26,009
A very brave and honorable deed, sir.

654
00:55:26,510 --> 00:55:30,181
In the light of your
action this evening, I...

655
00:55:30,218 --> 00:55:34,174
I dutifully admit that I
have misjudged your character.

656
00:55:35,592 --> 00:55:39,548
So I present you with
this medal for bravery.

657
00:55:39,964 --> 00:55:41,928
And...

658
00:55:41,964 --> 00:55:45,880
I salute you.

659
00:55:46,546 --> 00:55:48,302
In honor of the occasion,

660
00:55:48,338 --> 00:55:51,921
I surrender the bunk entirely.

661
00:55:51,957 --> 00:55:55,503
I shall sleep under the stars.

662
00:55:56,796 --> 00:56:00,711
Oh, uh, I await tomorrow's
flying demonstration...

663
00:56:00,877 --> 00:56:04,834
With great anticipation.

664
00:56:06,043 --> 00:56:10,001
You and me both, Pops.

665
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:19,378
- Oh!
- I'm sorry. Were you...

666
00:56:19,414 --> 00:56:21,961
- Is this your... I'll get down.
- No, no, it's just...

667
00:56:21,998 --> 00:56:24,163
- Since you're here...
- No, I'm glad you're here, because...

668
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:26,163
- I'm sorry. You go first.
- You go ahead. I'll...

669
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:30,709
Um, I just wanted to say...

670
00:56:30,746 --> 00:56:33,704
I may have been a bit harsh at first.

671
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:37,078
Well, what I really mean is,

672
00:56:37,114 --> 00:56:39,042
Thank you...

673
00:56:39,078 --> 00:56:41,744
For saving my life.

674
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:44,409
For saving our lives.

675
00:56:44,446 --> 00:56:46,663
You know,

676
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:48,663
I come up here every night...

677
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:52,658
And look out to that hill and just imagine
what it must be like on the other side.

678
00:56:52,865 --> 00:56:55,287
It's funny, I've...

679
00:56:55,324 --> 00:56:58,948
I've never actually felt
grass beneath my feet.

680
00:56:58,984 --> 00:57:00,911
I'm sorry.

681
00:57:00,948 --> 00:57:04,280
Here I am rambling on about hills and
grass, and you had something to say.

682
00:57:04,317 --> 00:57:06,202
Uh,
y-Y-Yeah.

683
00:57:06,238 --> 00:57:10,197
Um, it's just that, y
- You know,

684
00:57:10,363 --> 00:57:14,321
Life as I've experienced
it, you know, out there,

685
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:17,548
Lone free rangin' and stuff, it's, uh,

686
00:57:17,584 --> 00:57:20,240
It's full of disappointments and, uh...

687
00:57:20,277 --> 00:57:23,194
What, you mean grass isn't
all it's cracked up to be?

688
00:57:23,230 --> 00:57:25,156
Grass! Exactly. Grass.

689
00:57:25,193 --> 00:57:28,155
It's always greener on the other side.

690
00:57:28,192 --> 00:57:32,149
And then you get there
and it's brown and prickly.

691
00:57:32,899 --> 00:57:36,857
You see what I'm tryin' to say?

692
00:57:38,065 --> 00:57:42,023
What I'm trying to say is,

693
00:57:43,356 --> 00:57:46,938
You're welcome.

694
00:57:46,975 --> 00:57:48,943
You know,

695
00:57:48,979 --> 00:57:52,895
That hill is looking closer
tonight than it ever has before.

696
00:57:55,354 --> 00:57:57,649
Oh!

697
00:57:57,685 --> 00:58:01,644
Well, good night... Rocky.

698
00:58:03,352 --> 00:58:07,309
Good night... Ginger.

699
00:58:29,846 --> 00:58:33,636
Company, attention!

700
00:58:38,551 --> 00:58:41,426
Well, today's the day,
girls. We're going to fly!

701
00:58:41,462 --> 00:58:44,056
I can feel it!

702
00:58:44,093 --> 00:58:47,551
Finally, we get to see a
real professional in action.

703
00:58:47,587 --> 00:58:50,550
Better start warming
up. I'll go and get him.

704
00:58:50,586 --> 00:58:52,929
- Rocky. Knock
-Knock.

705
00:58:52,965 --> 00:58:56,924
Everyone's waiting, so I told them to...

706
00:59:00,714 --> 00:59:04,671
R
- Rocky?

707
01:00:45,817 --> 01:00:48,447
Oh, a cannon.

708
01:00:48,483 --> 01:00:50,586
Aye, that would give you thrust.

709
01:00:50,622 --> 01:00:52,653
I knew he was fake all along.

710
01:00:52,689 --> 01:00:56,647
In fact, I'm not even
certain he was American.

711
01:00:56,813 --> 01:00:59,646
So, what's the next plan, hen?

712
01:00:59,682 --> 01:01:01,609
Let's face it.

713
01:01:01,646 --> 01:01:04,645
The only way out of here
is wrapped in pastry.

714
01:01:06,396 --> 01:01:08,650
Perhaps he just went on holiday.

715
01:01:08,686 --> 01:01:11,977
Perhaps he just went to get
away from your infernal knitting!

716
01:01:12,013 --> 01:01:14,940
Ohh! Ohh!

717
01:01:14,977 --> 01:01:18,477
You were the one that was always
hitting him. See how you like it.

718
01:01:18,513 --> 01:01:21,392
Don't push me, four-Eyes!

719
01:01:23,303 --> 01:01:24,493
Quiet there!

720
01:01:24,737 --> 01:01:26,480
Quiet, I say!

721
01:01:26,517 --> 01:01:30,307
Dissension in the ranks. Precisely
what Jerry would have wanted.

722
01:01:30,344 --> 01:01:31,894
The old divide and conquer.

723
01:01:31,930 --> 01:01:35,889
A proper squadron work together,
like we did in my R.A.F. Days.

724
01:01:36,305 --> 01:01:39,034
Jocko at the stick, Flappy at the map...

725
01:01:39,071 --> 01:01:41,726
And old Whizzbang at
the tail-End Charlie.

726
01:01:41,762 --> 01:01:45,012
WingCo would give the call, hop
in the old crate, chocks away!

727
01:01:45,049 --> 01:01:48,433
Wizard show it was.
That's how you get medals.

728
01:01:48,470 --> 01:01:52,427
Will you shut up about
your stupid blooming medals!

729
01:01:52,635 --> 01:01:56,593
Ooh!

730
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:59,599
Ohh!

731
01:01:59,635 --> 01:02:01,723
How dare you!

732
01:02:01,759 --> 01:02:04,221
Madam, forgive me.

733
01:02:04,257 --> 01:02:06,342
A-As an officer, I offer my most...

734
01:02:22,712 --> 01:02:25,795
Fowler?

735
01:02:27,795 --> 01:02:30,336
Everyone, shut up!

736
01:02:31,711 --> 01:02:35,669
Eh?

737
01:02:39,001 --> 01:02:41,548
Fowler.

738
01:02:41,584 --> 01:02:44,021
What exactly is the R.A.F.?

739
01:02:44,057 --> 01:02:46,528
What do you mean, what is it?

740
01:02:46,564 --> 01:02:49,760
The Royal Air Force is what.

741
01:02:49,797 --> 01:02:52,956
Then what's the "old crate"?

742
01:02:54,288 --> 01:02:58,246
Ahh! There she is.

743
01:02:58,914 --> 01:03:00,793
Gorgeous, isn't she?

744
01:03:00,829 --> 01:03:03,793
You mean, you flew in one of these?

745
01:03:03,829 --> 01:03:07,453
Beautifully built. In fact, there's
a bit of a story to that as well.

746
01:03:07,489 --> 01:03:09,415
We were out on a "recce," you see.

747
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:12,410
Ops had given the go-Ahead,
but the weather duffed up.

748
01:03:12,447 --> 01:03:15,290
Yes. Of course.

749
01:03:15,327 --> 01:03:18,330
We might actually be
able to pull this off.

750
01:03:18,367 --> 01:03:21,742
- We're still going to fly out of here.
- What, what?

751
01:03:21,778 --> 01:03:23,700
Fowler's provided the answer.

752
01:03:23,736 --> 01:03:25,662
I have?

753
01:03:25,699 --> 01:03:28,657
Uh, yes, yes, yes. Of course I have.

754
01:03:28,694 --> 01:03:30,674
Uh, how have I?

755
01:03:30,710 --> 01:03:32,656
We'll make...

756
01:03:32,693 --> 01:03:34,619
A crate.

757
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:38,529
Mac, you'll handle the engineering.

758
01:03:38,565 --> 01:03:40,369
Babs, manufacturing.

759
01:03:40,405 --> 01:03:42,612
Fowler will be chief aviation advisor.

760
01:03:42,649 --> 01:03:44,297
Bunty, eggs.

761
01:03:44,333 --> 01:03:45,907
- Eggs?
- Eggs.

762
01:03:45,944 --> 01:03:49,278
Right, just like the ones
that rooster was gonna lay.

763
01:03:49,314 --> 01:03:52,240
Only roosters don't lay eggs, do they?

764
01:03:52,277 --> 01:03:55,276
- Don't they?
- No, it's a lady thing, apparently.

765
01:03:55,312 --> 01:03:57,239
Ask your mum.

766
01:03:57,276 --> 01:04:00,650
One egg for every item on the
list. First payment in advance.

767
01:04:00,686 --> 01:04:02,815
Right! When do we start?

768
01:04:02,852 --> 01:04:05,333
Come on!

769
01:04:05,370 --> 01:04:08,571
Hey.

770
01:04:08,607 --> 01:04:11,772
Oh!

771
01:04:13,564 --> 01:04:16,277
Huh?

772
01:04:16,313 --> 01:04:19,958
What the dickens?

773
01:04:19,995 --> 01:04:23,603
Oh, gnomes now.

774
01:04:27,144 --> 01:04:30,330
Voila!

775
01:04:30,367 --> 01:04:33,518
Give me.

776
01:04:43,265 --> 01:04:46,514
Hmm?

777
01:04:46,551 --> 01:04:49,765
Aah!

778
01:05:01,261 --> 01:05:05,178
- Ohh!
- All right, here.

779
01:05:14,134 --> 01:05:17,217
Eggs from heaven!

780
01:05:17,253 --> 01:05:20,300
No! From her bum!

781
01:05:46,753 --> 01:05:50,549
Mmm?

782
01:05:50,585 --> 01:05:54,168
- Idiot!
- That was close.

783
01:05:54,204 --> 01:05:56,213
Too close.

784
01:05:56,250 --> 01:05:59,168
We can't stop now. Come
on, everyone! Go for it!

785
01:05:59,204 --> 01:06:03,125
Really go for it! Go, go, go, go!

786
01:06:04,498 --> 01:06:07,082
- Mac, we need those
calculations quickly. - Uh-Huh.

787
01:06:07,119 --> 01:06:10,224
Agnes, that has to be really secure.

788
01:06:10,260 --> 01:06:13,330
- Careful up there, Fowler!
- Roger!

789
01:06:13,367 --> 01:06:15,294
Bunty, give him a hand.

790
01:06:15,330 --> 01:06:17,246
Well done, Babs. Keep it up.

791
01:06:17,282 --> 01:06:21,202
No problem, doll face.

792
01:06:34,451 --> 01:06:36,990
Oh, I'm the type of guy

793
01:06:37,027 --> 01:06:39,301
That likes to roam around

794
01:06:39,337 --> 01:06:41,872
I'm never in one place

795
01:06:41,908 --> 01:06:44,370
I roam from town to town

796
01:06:44,406 --> 01:06:48,073
And when I found myself
fallin' for some girl

797
01:06:48,109 --> 01:06:50,089
I'd hop right in that car...

798
01:06:50,126 --> 01:06:52,072
And travel 'round the world

799
01:06:52,108 --> 01:06:54,404
'Cause I'm a wanderer

800
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:56,326
Yeah A wanderer

801
01:06:56,362 --> 01:06:58,946
I roam around and
'round Around and 'round

802
01:07:00,945 --> 01:07:02,361
'Cause I'm a wanderer

803
01:07:02,398 --> 01:07:04,028
Yeah, a wanderer

804
01:07:04,064 --> 01:07:05,407
Oh, boy.

805
01:07:05,444 --> 01:07:11,568
I roam around and 'round
Around and 'round, around

806
01:07:11,604 --> 01:07:13,442
Come on.

807
01:07:15,901 --> 01:07:17,900
Please.

808
01:07:21,149 --> 01:07:25,064
Oh, no. He's fixed it.

809
01:07:29,147 --> 01:07:32,897
Get the chickens.

810
01:07:32,933 --> 01:07:36,164
Which ones?

811
01:07:36,201 --> 01:07:39,396
All of them.

812
01:07:44,144 --> 01:07:46,940
Me tools!

813
01:07:46,977 --> 01:07:49,893
Why, you thieving little buggers!

814
01:07:49,929 --> 01:07:53,808
What's the plan?

815
01:07:55,683 --> 01:07:57,557
- Attack!
- Huh?

816
01:07:59,432 --> 01:08:02,869
Nice plan.

817
01:08:02,905 --> 01:08:06,306
Mrs. Tweedy!

818
01:08:07,098 --> 01:08:10,226
Aaaah! Mrs. Tweedy!

819
01:08:10,262 --> 01:08:13,179
The chickens are revolting!

820
01:08:13,215 --> 01:08:16,096
Finally, something we agree on.

821
01:08:16,132 --> 01:08:17,970
Help! Mrs...

822
01:08:20,928 --> 01:08:22,739
Mmm... Mmm?

823
01:08:22,776 --> 01:08:25,623
Under the hut.

824
01:08:25,659 --> 01:08:28,469
Come on!

825
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:35,258
- What have we done?
- This is it, everyone.

826
01:08:35,295 --> 01:08:37,222
We're escaping.

827
01:08:37,258 --> 01:08:39,596
- What, now?
- Now!

828
01:08:39,632 --> 01:08:42,839
- But, Ginger, she's not ready.
- Listen.

829
01:08:42,876 --> 01:08:46,048
We'll either die free
chickens or die trying.

830
01:08:48,213 --> 01:08:51,337
Are those the only choices?

831
01:08:51,374 --> 01:08:54,463
- Let's do it.
- Scramble!

832
01:09:06,377 --> 01:09:10,334
This way!

833
01:09:41,702 --> 01:09:45,659
Mrs. Tweedy!

834
01:09:45,827 --> 01:09:48,789
The exits are located here and here.

835
01:09:48,826 --> 01:09:51,305
In the quite likely
event of an emergency,

836
01:09:51,342 --> 01:09:53,783
Put your head between your knees and...

837
01:09:53,820 --> 01:09:55,870
Kiss your bum good-Bye.

838
01:09:55,906 --> 01:09:58,115
All right, Fowler, ready for takeoff.

839
01:09:58,152 --> 01:10:02,072
Behind you all the way.

840
01:10:02,364 --> 01:10:04,947
But you're supposed to be up there.

841
01:10:04,983 --> 01:10:06,661
You're the pilot.

842
01:10:06,698 --> 01:10:10,654
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
I can't fly this contraption.

843
01:10:11,030 --> 01:10:14,154
Back in your day...
the Royal Air Force...

844
01:10:14,190 --> 01:10:17,070
6-4-4 Squadron,
poultry division.

845
01:10:17,106 --> 01:10:19,033
We were the mascots.

846
01:10:19,070 --> 01:10:21,818
You mean you never
actually flew the plane?

847
01:10:21,854 --> 01:10:24,044
Good heavens, no.

848
01:10:23,872 --> 01:10:26,198
I'm a chicken.

849
01:10:26,234 --> 01:10:30,190
The Royal Air Force doesn't let chickens
behind the controls of a complex aircraft.

850
01:10:31,775 --> 01:10:33,946
We're all gonna die!

851
01:10:33,565 --> 01:10:35,947
Fowler, you have to fly it.

852
01:10:35,983 --> 01:10:39,898
You're always talking about back in
your day. Well, today is your day.

853
01:10:41,773 --> 01:10:45,688
You can do it, you old sausage.

854
01:10:46,730 --> 01:10:48,979
Wing Commander T.I. Fowler...

855
01:10:49,015 --> 01:10:50,980
Reporting for duty.

856
01:10:53,395 --> 01:10:56,317
Well, come on. What are you waiting for?

857
01:10:56,353 --> 01:11:00,269
We haven't got all day. Let's
get this crate off the ground.

858
01:11:00,305 --> 01:11:02,264
Fowler! Now!

859
01:11:02,301 --> 01:11:04,226
Roger! Contact!

860
01:11:16,182 --> 01:11:20,140
Cleared for takeoff!

861
01:11:24,929 --> 01:11:29,054
Chocks away!

862
01:11:29,090 --> 01:11:33,013
Whoa!

863
01:11:36,344 --> 01:11:40,302
- Full throttle!
- Full throttle!

864
01:12:01,173 --> 01:12:03,635
We need more power!

865
01:12:03,672 --> 01:12:07,629
I cannot work miracles, Cap'n!
We're givin' her all she's got!

866
01:12:17,003 --> 01:12:20,960
- Gotcha!
- Hard right!

867
01:12:22,167 --> 01:12:24,835
Oh, mother!

868
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,833
Turn her around. I'll get the ramp.

869
01:12:40,623 --> 01:12:44,581
Aaah!

870
01:12:45,559 --> 01:12:49,204
Put the ramp down.

871
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:53,495
You are going to be a pie!

872
01:12:57,120 --> 01:13:01,076
Ginger!

873
01:13:01,494 --> 01:13:05,450
Rocky!

874
01:13:11,490 --> 01:13:15,448
Heads up!

875
01:13:26,716 --> 01:13:28,534
Look out!

876
01:13:28,571 --> 01:13:32,486
- Aah!
- Clear the runway!

877
01:13:51,150 --> 01:13:55,106
Ginger! Let's go!

878
01:13:57,897 --> 01:14:01,813
We're flying!

879
01:14:12,478 --> 01:14:15,145
- Aah!
- That's for leaving.

880
01:14:15,181 --> 01:14:16,649
Eew.

881
01:14:16,685 --> 01:14:20,643
And this is for coming back.

882
01:14:21,476 --> 01:14:23,439
- Whoa!
- Uhh!

883
01:14:23,476 --> 01:14:26,605
Great Scot! What was that?

884
01:14:26,641 --> 01:14:30,599
A cling-On, Cap'n! And
the engines can't take it!

885
01:14:34,889 --> 01:14:37,680
Oh, goodness.

886
01:14:37,716 --> 01:14:40,471
Babs! Scissors!

887
01:14:40,507 --> 01:14:41,851
Bingo.

888
01:14:41,887 --> 01:14:43,602
Lower me down.

889
01:14:43,638 --> 01:14:45,387
- But, Ginger, I...
- Just do it.

890
01:14:45,424 --> 01:14:47,768
Increase velocity!

891
01:14:47,804 --> 01:14:51,720
- What does that mean?
- It means pedal your flippin' giblets out!

892
01:15:04,466 --> 01:15:08,425
- Lower!
- I'm trying!

893
01:15:10,965 --> 01:15:14,173
- Aah!
- Aaah!

894
01:15:14,209 --> 01:15:17,380
- Fowler, look out!

895
01:15:23,630 --> 01:15:27,546
- Whoa!
- Oh! Ginger!

896
01:15:35,794 --> 01:15:39,750
Fire! Fire!

897
01:15:40,126 --> 01:15:44,083
Me eggs.

898
01:15:44,418 --> 01:15:46,922
No!

899
01:15:46,958 --> 01:15:50,873
Blea-Aah!

900
01:15:51,498 --> 01:15:53,378
More ammo! Hurry!

901
01:15:53,414 --> 01:15:55,663
- We got no more eggs!
- Ginger!

902
01:15:55,700 --> 01:15:58,413
Look out!

903
01:16:05,579 --> 01:16:09,537
No!

904
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:23,512
- Huh? -
Bye-Bye.

905
01:16:23,549 --> 01:16:26,449
- Aaah!
- Bombs away!

906
01:16:26,485 --> 01:16:29,329
Mr. Tweedy!

907
01:16:29,365 --> 01:16:33,282
Oh, that was good. That was good!

908
01:16:34,239 --> 01:16:37,343
The old bird bought it!

909
01:16:37,379 --> 01:16:40,446
Mrs. Tweedy! Mrs. Twee...

910
01:16:58,441 --> 01:17:02,401
Whoa!

911
01:17:12,564 --> 01:17:16,522
I told you they was organized.

912
01:17:26,770 --> 01:17:28,769
We did it, everyone!

913
01:17:41,393 --> 01:17:45,350
Ha, ha, ha, ha...

914
01:17:48,264 --> 01:17:50,244
Aww!

915
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:52,185
Whoa!

916
01:17:52,222 --> 01:17:56,138
Keep peddling! We're not there yet!

917
01:17:58,805 --> 01:18:02,762
You can't see paradise
if you don't pedal!

918
01:18:04,803 --> 01:18:11,265
Put your drumsticks into it!

919
01:18:11,302 --> 01:18:13,723
That's what I told him, what, what.

920
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:17,591
We were losing altitude, you see,
and heading for a fearful prang.

921
01:18:17,628 --> 01:18:19,921
This is a lovely holiday.

922
01:18:19,957 --> 01:18:22,179
I'll be sad to go back.

923
01:18:22,215 --> 01:18:25,173
Safety at all times is imperative.

924
01:18:25,209 --> 01:18:27,190
Now, wind 'er up and...

925
01:18:27,227 --> 01:18:29,172
- Whee!
- Let 'er go!

926
01:18:30,041 --> 01:18:31,221
So...

927
01:18:31,257 --> 01:18:33,256
Is it as good as you imagined?

928
01:18:33,293 --> 01:18:35,386
No.

929
01:18:35,735 --> 01:18:38,593
It's better.

930
01:18:39,358 --> 01:18:42,586
Come on. I'll show
you how to play cricket.

931
01:18:45,836 --> 01:18:48,050
'Ey, 'ey, here's a thought.

932
01:18:48,086 --> 01:18:51,377
Why don't we get an egg and
start our own chicken farm?

933
01:18:51,413 --> 01:18:54,376
That way we'll have all
the eggs we could eat.

934
01:18:54,412 --> 01:18:57,000
Right. We'll need a chicken then.

935
01:18:57,036 --> 01:18:58,881
No. No, we'll need an egg.

936
01:18:58,918 --> 01:19:02,296
You have the egg first. That's
where you get the chicken from.

937
01:19:02,332 --> 01:19:05,374
No, that's cobblers. If you don't have
a chicken, where you gonna get an egg?

938
01:19:05,410 --> 01:19:08,337
From the chicken that
comes from the egg.

939
01:19:08,374 --> 01:19:11,336
Yeah, but you have to have
an egg to have a chicken.

940
01:19:11,373 --> 01:19:13,330
Yeah, but you gotta get the
chicken first to get the egg,

941
01:19:13,366 --> 01:19:17,329
And then the egg...
you get the chicken out.

942
01:19:17,365 --> 01:19:21,286
Hang on. Let's go over this again.

943
01:19:28,909 --> 01:19:31,827
<i># All right. #</i>

944
01:19:31,863 --> 01:19:33,957

959

960
01:21:07,458 --> 01:21:12,000

01:21:12,250 --> 01:21:17,040

962
01:21:17,290 --> 01:21:19,582

963
01:21:19,832 --> 01:21:21,332

01:21:21,582 --> 01:21:25,164
<i># Don't ever leave me,

965
01:21:25,414 --> 01:21:29,123
<i># Yeah! Bye-bye #</i>

966
01:22:47,744 --> 01:22:49,748
The egg, obviously.

967
01:22:49,784 --> 01:22:51,748
Rollin' along, happy as Larry.

968
01:22:51,784 --> 01:22:54,804
Then, crack! Hatches
into the first chicken.

969
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:57,498
Yeah, but where'd the
egg come from, then?

970
01:22:57,534 --> 01:22:59,116
What do you mean, where'd it come from?

971
01:22:59,153 --> 01:23:01,602
Egg comes rollin' along, happy as Larry.

972
01:23:01,638 --> 01:23:04,952
It's wonderin'
where'd it come from?

973
01:23:04,988 --> 01:23:08,176
Without a chicken, you get
no egg to come rollin' along.

974
01:23:08,629 --> 01:23:11,118
Well, conversely, without an
egg to hatch into the chicken,

975
01:23:11,154 --> 01:23:14,153
Then there will be no chicken to lay the
other egg that hatches into the chicken...

976
01:23:14,189 --> 01:23:15,972
That lays the egg I
mentioned in the first place.

977
01:23:16,007 --> 01:23:17,299
So we got two eggs now?

978
01:23:17,300 --> 01:23:20,049
No, we're still talking
about the very first egg.

979
01:23:20,085 --> 01:23:21,982
What happened about
the very first chicken?

980
01:23:21,775 --> 01:23:23,777
It's in the very first egg!

981
01:23:22,980 --> 01:23:26,776
- Don't you listenin'?
- Uh, guys, guys?

982
01:23:27,021 --> 01:23:29,063
Tryin' to enjoy paradise over here.

983
01:23:29,516 --> 01:23:31,316
- Oh, sorry, guv.
- Beg your pardon.

984
01:23:31,561 --> 01:23:34,483
- Won't happen again.
- Thanks.

985
01:23:34,936 --> 01:23:36,903
- Gitface.
- Pillock.

986
01:23:37,148 --> 01:23:40,356
Thinks he's such a big shot 'cause
he's got his name on a poster.

987
01:23:40,601 --> 01:23:42,861
These show biz folk are all the same.

988
01:23:42,377 --> 01:23:45,860
- Yeah, the rats are the stars, actually.
- Yeah, of course they are.

989
01:23:46,105 --> 01:23:47,605
- We do all the work,
- But he does get all the birds.

990
01:23:47,606 --> 01:23:48,439
He gets all the credit.

991
01:23:48,933 --> 01:23:51,021
- He gets everything.
- Yes, he does. Everything.

992
01:23:51,057 --> 01:23:54,978
- You said it, mate.
- I know.
