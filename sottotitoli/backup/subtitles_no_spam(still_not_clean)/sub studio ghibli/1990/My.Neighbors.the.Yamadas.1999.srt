00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000

1
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:19,946
This is the sun, this is the moon,

2
00:00:20,556 --> 00:00:23,386
this mountain is really the earth,

3
00:00:26,966 --> 00:00:30,026
and this is grandma.

4
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:54,016
My how splendid...

5
00:00:55,156 --> 00:00:57,286
Hello, Mrs. Yamada.

6
00:00:57,656 --> 00:01:01,426
I've never seen such a magnificent...

7
00:01:01,526 --> 00:01:04,496
Yup, they're my little babies.

8
00:01:04,596 --> 00:01:06,086
What species?

9
00:01:06,206 --> 00:01:09,036
This is a Mino Chrysanthemum, this is...

10
00:01:09,136 --> 00:01:11,236
No, I mean the caterpillar.

11
00:01:15,416 --> 00:01:16,676
No idea.

12
00:01:17,576 --> 00:01:21,376
Grow into a butterfly just as gaudy as that flower.

13
00:01:24,956 --> 00:01:26,856
Mother!

14
00:01:27,886 --> 00:01:30,326
That's our grandma.

15
00:01:40,306 --> 00:01:44,266
And my mother and me, Nonoko.

16
00:01:45,346 --> 00:01:48,406
What am I going to make for dinner tonight...

17
00:01:51,776 --> 00:01:55,446
I know, I'll go for it! Something really special!

18
00:01:55,556 --> 00:01:56,846
What are we having?

19
00:01:57,186 --> 00:01:59,716
We had curry last week. Curry two days ago.

20
00:01:59,856 --> 00:02:02,116
Tonight... Curry!!

21
00:02:02,226 --> 00:02:03,286
What...

22
00:02:14,836 --> 00:02:18,066
And this is my father and my older brother.

23
00:02:18,236 --> 00:02:21,766
What's the use of all this studying, Dad?

24
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:24,436
Listen, Noboru.

25
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:29,146
Studying is not about what's useful or not.

26
00:02:29,356 --> 00:02:32,916
The studying that seems useless may turn out to be useful.

27
00:02:33,026 --> 00:02:35,486
On the other hand, it might be that

28
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:39,386
studying that doesn't seem not useful may not be,

29
00:02:39,766 --> 00:02:42,926
but then studying that seems useless may then be useful.

30
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:47,126
But when you really need it,
it's not about useful or useless...

31
00:02:47,566 --> 00:02:50,296
What are you going on about?

32
00:02:53,576 --> 00:02:55,636
So I still have to study.

33
00:03:06,256 --> 00:03:06,286
MY NEIGHBORS THE YAMADAS

34
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:14,256
MY NEIGHBORS THE YAMADAS

35
00:03:26,146 --> 00:03:27,576
I get it...

36
00:03:28,946 --> 00:03:32,076
If my father had been smart and really cool,

37
00:03:32,346 --> 00:03:36,186
and my mother had been gorgeous and a great cook,

38
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:42,356
and our family had been rich, my whole life would've been different.

39
00:03:46,066 --> 00:03:48,586
If at least one of them...

40
00:03:48,696 --> 00:03:51,066
Don't be ridiculous.

41
00:03:51,336 --> 00:03:55,296
If we hadn't married, there'd be no you, and no Nonoko.

42
00:03:55,576 --> 00:03:58,696
Without the two of us, you wouldn't be here.

43
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,206
No, that's wrong.

44
00:04:01,476 --> 00:04:05,706
If I had cooler parents, I'd just be their kid.

45
00:04:05,816 --> 00:04:07,216
How stupid.

46
00:04:07,316 --> 00:04:11,116
Don't you know about stamens and pistils?

47
00:04:11,216 --> 00:04:12,206
You tell him.

48
00:04:12,326 --> 00:04:14,016
You can't choose your parents.

49
00:04:14,126 --> 00:04:18,616
No, I can't accept that. Something's not right.

50
00:04:18,766 --> 00:04:22,896
Because I'm me, Dad's Dad and Mom's Mom.

51
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:26,096
What is that supposed to mean?

52
00:04:27,736 --> 00:04:29,256
Who am I?

53
00:04:30,176 --> 00:04:32,336
Where did I come from?

54
00:04:33,476 --> 00:04:34,876
Where am I?

55
00:04:35,816 --> 00:04:37,366
Who am I?

56
00:04:39,086 --> 00:04:40,576
I get it...

57
00:04:41,286 --> 00:04:45,486
So, there was a time when Dad and Mom weren't married.

58
00:05:09,646 --> 00:05:14,416
Takashi and Matsuko are off to a great start in their new life.

59
00:05:14,516 --> 00:05:17,146
Let's give them a warm send-off.

60
00:05:19,556 --> 00:05:23,186
Congratulations, Takashi and Matsuko.

61
00:05:23,796 --> 00:05:29,426
I also offer warm wishes to their parents and relatives.

62
00:05:37,776 --> 00:05:40,466
Now, your prospects are boundless,

63
00:05:40,576 --> 00:05:45,676
and you're embarking for the wide open world, under billowing sails.

64
00:05:59,596 --> 00:06:02,586
Life, as they say, has its ups and downs.

65
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:07,936
At times, the waves may taunt you, tossing you in their swells.

66
00:06:08,366 --> 00:06:10,426
But take heart.

67
00:06:10,776 --> 00:06:15,106
It's hard to stick with it and make it on your own,

68
00:06:15,746 --> 00:06:21,076
but even a couple of losers
can survive most things if they're together.

69
00:06:24,786 --> 00:06:30,386
So listen, take my advice
and have children as soon as you can.

70
00:06:31,226 --> 00:06:36,896
Children are the best reason for riding out life's storms.

71
00:07:46,536 --> 00:07:51,436
Nowadays people say child-rearing
is challenging and difficult,

72
00:07:51,536 --> 00:07:54,236
but we've done it from time immemorial.

73
00:07:54,876 --> 00:07:57,706
Children grow even without parents.

74
00:07:58,016 --> 00:08:04,716
So hold them close to your heart as they crawl,
then walk. They'll be fine.

75
00:08:15,466 --> 00:08:18,596
Children make you appreciate your own parents.

76
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:22,396
Parents may seem to do nothing but order you around,

77
00:08:22,506 --> 00:08:26,636
but they'll baby-sit your kids
and sometimes give them toys.

78
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:29,806
Nowadays young people

79
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:35,436
turn that saying about appreciating parents
to their own advantage.

80
00:08:35,886 --> 00:08:38,816
But I guess that's part of it too.

81
00:08:39,856 --> 00:08:44,756
If things work out, you even get the real estate.

82
00:08:47,566 --> 00:08:50,296
So Matsuko and Takashi,

83
00:08:50,636 --> 00:08:53,496
start looking after your folks!

84
00:08:53,836 --> 00:08:57,066
I hope you know the land is in my name.

85
00:08:57,176 --> 00:09:00,576
Excuse me, mother, but I built this house.

86
00:09:00,676 --> 00:09:03,076
Without land, there's no house.

87
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:06,166
And we are grateful to you,

88
00:09:06,286 --> 00:09:08,616
but I've worked hard, too.

89
00:09:08,716 --> 00:09:11,416
Your room gets the best light.

90
00:09:11,516 --> 00:09:13,116
Thanks for nothing.

91
00:09:13,226 --> 00:09:17,246
Of course it does. It's on my land.

92
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:21,626
Besides, why do you always insist
you built it by yourself.

93
00:09:21,726 --> 00:09:25,026
I hate to contradict you, but I definitely built...

94
00:09:25,136 --> 00:09:27,366
That's enough!

95
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:28,936
Both of you.

96
00:09:29,036 --> 00:09:32,696
That's right! What's the point of all this bickering!

97
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:34,336
Listen to Noboru.

98
00:09:34,446 --> 00:09:36,536
In the end, it'll all be mine.

99
00:10:01,266 --> 00:10:05,896
And what should you fear most on this lifelong voyage?

100
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:08,776
Wild storms and rip tides?

101
00:10:16,686 --> 00:10:21,176
No. Beware the calm waters,
when there's hardly a ripple in sight.

102
00:10:21,726 --> 00:10:26,056
As long as a family holds each other tight, they can somehow

103
00:10:26,266 --> 00:10:28,426
weather the wildest seas.

104
00:10:28,626 --> 00:10:30,726
But calm waters are another story.

105
00:10:30,836 --> 00:10:37,296
The wind dies down, you sigh and relax, loosening your clasp.

106
00:10:37,976 --> 00:10:40,776
But take care, Matsuko and Takashi!

107
00:10:42,306 --> 00:10:48,616
If in the calm you selfishly please only yourselves,
you may lose each other.

108
00:10:52,586 --> 00:10:57,046
You'll never see the sharks gathering around you.

109
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:05,726
And how will you guide your ship?

110
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:10,196
Without a wind, or even a course?

111
00:11:10,406 --> 00:11:13,736
If you row blindly, right, no, left,

112
00:11:13,846 --> 00:11:18,676
no, right after all, you'll never agree.

113
00:11:18,976 --> 00:11:23,606
You may even wonder why you're stuck on the same boat at all.

114
00:11:24,456 --> 00:11:26,946
Your family's about to fall apart.

115
00:11:27,786 --> 00:11:28,886
Turn right there!

116
00:11:28,986 --> 00:11:29,926
You sure?

117
00:11:30,196 --> 00:11:31,126
Turn left!

118
00:11:31,226 --> 00:11:33,286
Right, right! No, left, left!

119
00:11:33,396 --> 00:11:34,386
Which way!

120
00:11:34,566 --> 00:11:36,056
Oh dear, maybe right.

121
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:37,686
Which is it!!??

122
00:11:46,446 --> 00:11:48,376
We came so close...

123
00:11:48,476 --> 00:11:49,566
Our turn!

124
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:51,966
A Family Crisis

125
00:11:58,816 --> 00:12:01,516
Oh, no, this isn't the way.

126
00:12:01,626 --> 00:12:03,086
You should've turned!

127
00:12:03,196 --> 00:12:04,586
No, no, go straight!

128
00:12:04,696 --> 00:12:06,996
No, it's that way, are you crazy?

129
00:12:07,096 --> 00:12:08,726
It's this way, Dad!

130
00:12:08,926 --> 00:12:11,266
Quiet! All of you.

131
00:12:12,336 --> 00:12:14,736
Nonoko's the only one who's quiet.

132
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:17,866
Hm...she's not here.

133
00:12:19,846 --> 00:12:20,936
What?

134
00:12:21,446 --> 00:12:22,846
Where is she?

135
00:12:22,946 --> 00:12:24,876
Stop the car.

136
00:12:29,586 --> 00:12:31,886
Where did we lose her?

137
00:12:32,086 --> 00:12:35,386
Noboru, weren't you with her?

138
00:12:35,626 --> 00:12:39,026
Yeah, while Dad and I were waiting for you.

139
00:12:39,366 --> 00:12:42,096
Maybe she got bored and wandered off.

140
00:12:42,196 --> 00:12:44,686
No, I remember her on the bench.

141
00:12:50,906 --> 00:12:52,806
I'm so sorry.

142
00:12:54,576 --> 00:12:56,706
What took you so long?

143
00:12:56,816 --> 00:12:59,646
Sorry, I didn't mean to.

144
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:02,076
I could have done some shopping, too.

145
00:13:02,186 --> 00:13:05,046
I wanted to look at baseball bats.

146
00:13:09,056 --> 00:13:12,656
I'm sure she's still there.

147
00:13:19,506 --> 00:13:23,336
It's all because you kept yelling about how late we were.

148
00:13:23,436 --> 00:13:26,666
Don't blame me. You're the ones who were late.

149
00:13:26,776 --> 00:13:32,176
You all got so excited, you just left poor Nonoko behind.

150
00:13:32,276 --> 00:13:35,576
Like you weren't there yourself, grandma.

151
00:13:35,686 --> 00:13:38,816
We were looking for your flannel underwear!

152
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:41,946
The store'll close. I'll never make it.

153
00:13:42,056 --> 00:13:44,426
Stop thinking about yourself.

154
00:13:44,526 --> 00:13:47,616
What if something terrible happens to Nonoko?

155
00:13:48,196 --> 00:13:49,686
Something terrible?

156
00:13:50,866 --> 00:13:53,126
You don't mean...kidnapped!

157
00:13:55,466 --> 00:13:58,136
She's so adorable, just like me.

158
00:14:00,276 --> 00:14:02,266
This is no time for jokes!

159
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:06,666
If only that would work now.

160
00:14:06,786 --> 00:14:08,046
What do you mean, that?

161
00:14:08,146 --> 00:14:09,876
The PTA mantra.

162
00:14:10,786 --> 00:14:14,276
'Don't talk to strangers.'

163
00:14:14,626 --> 00:14:17,386
That's what you teach children?

164
00:14:17,496 --> 00:14:20,986
It's like saying all strangers are thieves.

165
00:14:21,096 --> 00:14:23,566
Nonoko's fine. Those teeth!

166
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:27,536
Hey, cake! Gimmee some!

167
00:14:28,006 --> 00:14:29,666
Just one bite.

168
00:14:29,836 --> 00:14:30,896
OK!

169
00:14:32,806 --> 00:14:34,366
One chomp of those teeth!

170
00:14:34,476 --> 00:14:35,536
Enough!

171
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:43,746
Please move, our daughter may have been kidnapped!

172
00:14:47,756 --> 00:14:49,126
We can't even call.

173
00:14:49,226 --> 00:14:51,886
We should've called before.

174
00:14:51,996 --> 00:14:53,556
I told you to buy a cell phone.

175
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:55,426
You keep quiet!

176
00:14:57,266 --> 00:15:00,426
Oh, Nonoko!

177
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:28,356
Are you lost?

178
00:15:29,966 --> 00:15:33,196
Huh, so you're waiting for someone?

179
00:15:41,246 --> 00:15:42,836
Who are you waiting for?

180
00:15:44,646 --> 00:15:46,376
Can't you talk?

181
00:15:47,286 --> 00:15:49,546
Then why don't you say anything?

182
00:15:49,956 --> 00:15:55,186
I'm not s'pposed to people I don't know.

183
00:15:55,486 --> 00:16:01,356
I know,'Don't talk to strangers.'

184
00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:08,766
You're very grown-up, because you're careful.
You can talk now.

185
00:16:09,336 --> 00:16:11,166
You should hear my story.

186
00:16:11,636 --> 00:16:16,336
My father and mother and grandma and brother all got lost.

187
00:16:16,776 --> 00:16:18,646
Did you lose someone?

188
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:21,646
My mommy.

189
00:16:21,886 --> 00:16:23,286
Your mommy?

190
00:16:23,456 --> 00:16:27,386
My mommy went away...

191
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:31,686
I know...there've been a lot of missing parents lately...

192
00:16:32,296 --> 00:16:35,926
But it's only your mom, you'll find her.

193
00:16:41,406 --> 00:16:44,736
Excuse me, this is Toshio Kimura.

194
00:16:44,836 --> 00:16:46,936
Can you please call his mom?

195
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:48,036
Oh, he's lost?

196
00:16:48,146 --> 00:16:50,546
No he's not, they were separated.

197
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:52,816
Right.

198
00:16:54,386 --> 00:16:57,316
And your first name, Mr. Kimura?

199
00:16:57,486 --> 00:16:58,546
- Toshio. - Toshio.

200
00:16:58,716 --> 00:17:00,116
Toshio, then.

201
00:17:00,726 --> 00:17:03,416
Wait here a minute, OK?

202
00:17:05,926 --> 00:17:08,556
And you? Are you his sister?

203
00:17:08,926 --> 00:17:10,416
No, no relation.

204
00:17:10,536 --> 00:17:13,556
My whole family's lost.

205
00:17:26,986 --> 00:17:32,176
Poor little, poor little, lost pussy cat...

206
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:42,856
Stop crying, we're here.

207
00:18:11,526 --> 00:18:13,756
What! She went with her mother!?!

208
00:18:13,866 --> 00:18:15,956
I'm her mother!

209
00:18:16,066 --> 00:18:17,696
Oh, is that so?

210
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:20,856
How dare you give her to a stranger!

211
00:18:21,136 --> 00:18:24,596
It may not have been her mother, but she was no stranger.

212
00:18:24,836 --> 00:18:27,176
No stranger? Who could it be?

213
00:18:27,276 --> 00:18:28,836
I don't know anyone...

214
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,376
Someone pretending to be friendly...

215
00:18:33,716 --> 00:18:37,516
No, she recognized Nonoko.

216
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:38,646
That wasn't her mother!

217
00:18:38,756 --> 00:18:40,946
Calm down! And then?

218
00:18:42,556 --> 00:18:44,086
I'm terribly sorry.

219
00:18:44,196 --> 00:18:50,396
Nonoko went off happily with someone
who seemed like her mother.

220
00:18:51,136 --> 00:18:53,656
Oh no... Who can it be...

221
00:18:54,206 --> 00:18:56,136
Will you please page Nonoko?

222
00:18:56,306 --> 00:18:59,796
Actually...they went out that exit together.

223
00:18:59,906 --> 00:19:00,736
Not here.

224
00:19:00,846 --> 00:19:01,706
Come on!

225
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:09,476
That's some family...

226
00:19:18,356 --> 00:19:21,196
Dad, where are you racing off to?

227
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,456
We're chasing it!

228
00:19:22,566 --> 00:19:23,256
What?

229
00:19:23,366 --> 00:19:25,766
The car Nonoko's in!

230
00:19:25,866 --> 00:19:27,196
What kind of car?

231
00:19:32,876 --> 00:19:36,466
We don't even know which way it went!

232
00:19:37,346 --> 00:19:40,436
She'll be fine. Nonoko knew the lady, right?

233
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:42,576
I bet she took her home.

234
00:19:43,256 --> 00:19:45,486
I'm sure Noboru's right.

235
00:19:46,556 --> 00:19:49,216
Sure, that must be it.

236
00:19:49,326 --> 00:19:52,516
Don't be so sure. You can't trust anyone these days.

237
00:19:52,626 --> 00:19:53,856
Mother!

238
00:19:53,966 --> 00:19:57,366
Don't you think you should notify the police?

239
00:19:57,466 --> 00:19:58,526
The police!

240
00:19:58,636 --> 00:20:00,466
How would we explain?

241
00:20:00,836 --> 00:20:02,926
Make a full confession.

242
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:03,936
Confession!

243
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:09,106
That four grown people
neglected and abandoned a young girl.

244
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:12,676
Say, does Nonoko have a key?

245
00:20:13,986 --> 00:20:15,036
Let's go home!

246
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:47,876
Nonoko!

247
00:20:49,146 --> 00:20:52,886
Nonoko!

248
00:20:53,286 --> 00:20:54,376
Nonoko!

249
00:20:58,226 --> 00:20:59,246
Nonoko!

250
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:03,856
Not here.

251
00:21:04,366 --> 00:21:06,836
Of course not, it was locked.

252
00:21:10,976 --> 00:21:13,236
Hello.

253
00:21:15,106 --> 00:21:17,476
Oh, thank goodness!

254
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:20,946
Thank you! Thank you so much!

255
00:21:22,346 --> 00:21:26,046
Thank you! We were looking everywhere for her.

256
00:21:26,316 --> 00:21:28,716
I'm so sorry for all this...

257
00:21:29,056 --> 00:21:34,396
Yes, we'll be right over.

258
00:21:35,226 --> 00:21:37,896
You even made her dinner...

259
00:21:38,396 --> 00:21:44,096
You're so very kind, how can we possibly thank you...

260
00:21:49,006 --> 00:21:52,106
They finally got home.

261
00:21:52,246 --> 00:21:54,806
They're coming right over.

262
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:56,476
I'm sorry, auntie.

263
00:21:57,016 --> 00:21:58,886
Oh, it's nothing.

264
00:21:58,986 --> 00:22:03,886
I can't wait to hear their side of the story.

265
00:22:22,546 --> 00:22:27,106
Look up and see, the blue skies,

266
00:22:27,216 --> 00:22:30,946
the white clouds

267
00:22:31,386 --> 00:22:37,056
One of these days, it'll all work out

268
00:22:59,216 --> 00:23:02,146
- Next stop Luncheon Court.

269
00:23:12,826 --> 00:23:15,526
What did you call this stop?

270
00:23:16,166 --> 00:23:18,256
Can you stand back, ma'am?

271
00:23:22,436 --> 00:23:24,406
Home Economics Wizard

272
00:23:24,836 --> 00:23:27,396
Oh, dear, it started raining.

273
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:35,816
The laundry!

274
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:42,046
Huh?

275
00:23:48,266 --> 00:23:49,626
What's the fuss?

276
00:23:55,266 --> 00:23:57,466
That's right! I'd already brought it in.

277
00:23:57,576 --> 00:23:59,626
You never even hung it up!

278
00:24:01,346 --> 00:24:04,576
I'm going out. Can I get you anything?

279
00:24:04,916 --> 00:24:07,276
Oh! There was something...

280
00:24:08,086 --> 00:24:12,386
What was it... Um...um...

281
00:24:14,086 --> 00:24:16,216
OK, then, I'm going.

282
00:24:19,026 --> 00:24:22,426
It's just that, oh, what was it...

283
00:24:34,176 --> 00:24:35,766
Wait, wait, wait, wait...

284
00:24:35,876 --> 00:24:37,576
What is it!

285
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:43,316
Um, that is, um...

286
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:46,016
Why don't you just give up!

287
00:24:47,956 --> 00:24:49,716
Oh, bread!

288
00:24:53,296 --> 00:24:55,266
Get it yourself!

289
00:24:55,966 --> 00:24:57,586
Mom!

290
00:24:59,036 --> 00:25:00,596
Money, money.

291
00:25:02,106 --> 00:25:03,396
I'm home.

292
00:25:05,236 --> 00:25:07,636
I guess Mom's not here.

293
00:25:09,806 --> 00:25:11,246
Wow, noodles.

294
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:13,606
And the water's boiling.

295
00:25:14,016 --> 00:25:16,946
Great, I'll go ahead and eat'em.

296
00:25:23,356 --> 00:25:25,486
Oh, you're home.

297
00:25:35,636 --> 00:25:37,266
You were hiding!

298
00:25:42,246 --> 00:25:43,146
Say.

299
00:25:45,016 --> 00:25:46,606
The bulb's out.

300
00:25:47,216 --> 00:25:49,776
That's no good. Better change it.

301
00:25:51,186 --> 00:25:54,246
Oh, darn...no spares.

302
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:57,516
Just switch it with one you don't use.

303
00:25:59,556 --> 00:26:00,996
Up we go.

304
00:26:04,466 --> 00:26:06,056
I'm just borrowing it...

305
00:26:06,166 --> 00:26:07,926
Ouch, it's hot.

306
00:26:11,936 --> 00:26:13,236
Tea.

307
00:26:13,336 --> 00:26:14,436
Me, too.

308
00:26:14,546 --> 00:26:15,506
Me, too.

309
00:26:15,876 --> 00:26:19,646
I'm busy washing the dishes.
Get in here one of you!

310
00:26:22,386 --> 00:26:24,476
paper scissors rock

311
00:26:27,186 --> 00:26:29,786
Get your cup out.

312
00:26:35,696 --> 00:26:38,356
The dishes are all yours.

313
00:26:38,666 --> 00:26:39,896
What!

314
00:26:41,106 --> 00:26:43,266
Mr. Tanaka says he's coming over.

315
00:26:43,366 --> 00:26:45,536
What! Oh, no.

316
00:26:48,946 --> 00:26:50,916
Better tidy up a little.

317
00:26:56,386 --> 00:26:57,286
Ouch.

318
00:27:09,896 --> 00:27:11,456
Hey, what are you doing?

319
00:27:11,566 --> 00:27:13,866
I'll say we're spring cleaning!

320
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:22,976
Marriage Yamada Style

321
00:27:26,776 --> 00:27:28,976
It's on the kitchen table.

322
00:27:31,056 --> 00:27:32,486
No, it's not.

323
00:27:32,956 --> 00:27:35,186
Are you sure? I know I left it.

324
00:27:35,286 --> 00:27:37,056
It isn't here.

325
00:27:37,626 --> 00:27:39,356
Where did you look?

326
00:27:39,456 --> 00:27:42,586
It's a manila envelope that says OKK in red.

327
00:27:43,066 --> 00:27:44,726
Is this it, sir?

328
00:27:46,866 --> 00:27:49,336
Oh, uh...OK. Well,

329
00:27:50,936 --> 00:27:53,136
if it's gone, it's gone.

330
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:55,406
Hey.

331
00:27:55,706 --> 00:27:56,676
Here.

332
00:27:56,776 --> 00:27:59,266
That's 20 years of marriage for you.

333
00:27:59,576 --> 00:28:00,676
Gimme the paper.

334
00:28:00,786 --> 00:28:02,476
When I'm done.

335
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:05,916
Impressive.

336
00:28:14,126 --> 00:28:16,186
Can you pick up a few things?

337
00:28:16,296 --> 00:28:17,166
Sure.

338
00:28:17,436 --> 00:28:22,236
Lettuce, cucumber, ham, light bulbs and garbage bags.

339
00:28:22,606 --> 00:28:23,936
I'll make a list.

340
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:25,336
No, I've got it.

341
00:28:29,576 --> 00:28:32,276
Lettuce, cucumber, ham,

342
00:28:32,846 --> 00:28:34,976
light bulbs and garbage bags, right?

343
00:28:35,316 --> 00:28:36,406
I told you.

344
00:28:36,516 --> 00:28:39,116
It's not exactly like I forgot.

345
00:28:41,656 --> 00:28:43,986
Lettuce...cucumber...

346
00:28:49,396 --> 00:28:51,726
Let's see...

347
00:28:53,806 --> 00:28:54,966
Make up your mind.

348
00:28:55,306 --> 00:28:57,706
Have you decided?

349
00:28:58,006 --> 00:28:59,976
Just hurry up.

350
00:29:03,406 --> 00:29:05,346
I'll take the Shanghai Special.

351
00:29:05,516 --> 00:29:06,676
Me too.

352
00:29:07,546 --> 00:29:09,076
Two Shanghai Specials.

353
00:29:14,956 --> 00:29:17,356
Oh, you're still here?

354
00:29:17,456 --> 00:29:19,046
What do you mean,'still'?

355
00:29:19,156 --> 00:29:21,926
Can't I rest on my day off?

356
00:29:22,166 --> 00:29:24,926
Usually, you're off at Pachinko.

357
00:29:25,366 --> 00:29:28,736
Nope, I'm giving it a rest. How about some tea?

358
00:29:29,606 --> 00:29:31,836
And noodles for lunch.

359
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:33,336
Yes, dear.

360
00:29:35,276 --> 00:29:38,436
Actually, make that coffee, not tea!

361
00:29:42,286 --> 00:29:45,716
And the bathroom's a wreck.

362
00:29:46,186 --> 00:29:47,586
Clean it up.

363
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:51,516
And when you go shopping I need cigarettes.

364
00:29:51,626 --> 00:29:54,526
What a pain in the neck!

365
00:29:58,096 --> 00:30:00,796
Honey, honey...

366
00:30:03,236 --> 00:30:04,996
Where's your mother?

367
00:30:05,176 --> 00:30:06,836
Out playing Pachinko.

368
00:30:32,166 --> 00:30:34,996
It's just about to start.

369
00:30:45,076 --> 00:30:46,046
It's not over.

370
00:30:46,146 --> 00:30:48,636
But I was looking forward to it.

371
00:30:48,946 --> 00:30:49,846
No.

372
00:30:49,986 --> 00:30:51,476
It's a movie!

373
00:31:24,486 --> 00:31:26,646
Now nobody can watch.

374
00:31:26,856 --> 00:31:28,916
This is much more fun.

375
00:31:44,876 --> 00:31:46,466
I win!

376
00:32:43,766 --> 00:32:44,956
Hey, Noboru.

377
00:32:45,966 --> 00:32:47,266
Wanna play catch?

378
00:32:48,406 --> 00:32:49,266
Yeah.

379
00:32:49,366 --> 00:32:50,766
Male Bonding

380
00:32:50,876 --> 00:32:52,366
No Trespassing

381
00:32:57,106 --> 00:33:00,846
Wait, the dad's supposed to be the catcher.

382
00:33:01,246 --> 00:33:02,736
Give me a break.

383
00:33:05,486 --> 00:33:09,616
OK, this signal for a curve ball, this for a fastball,

384
00:33:09,856 --> 00:33:11,616
and this for a slider.

385
00:33:11,896 --> 00:33:13,726
Give me a break.

386
00:33:14,026 --> 00:33:16,856
Two outs, bases loaded, you're the relief pitcher.

387
00:33:16,966 --> 00:33:19,726
I'm the starting pitcher type.

388
00:33:19,836 --> 00:33:21,456
Give me a break!

389
00:33:21,636 --> 00:33:23,266
Are you nuts?

390
00:33:23,366 --> 00:33:25,866
The team never even lets you pitch.

391
00:33:25,976 --> 00:33:28,836
That's why I want to start now.

392
00:33:29,946 --> 00:33:33,246
I see. OK, let's see this starting pitcher pitch.

393
00:33:34,286 --> 00:33:37,046
It's still two outs, bases loaded.

394
00:33:37,146 --> 00:33:38,246
What!

395
00:33:55,036 --> 00:33:56,296
OK, pitch.

396
00:34:01,646 --> 00:34:03,046
God damn it!

397
00:34:07,146 --> 00:34:08,906
What are you listening to?

398
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:14,986
Listening over and over will improve my English.

399
00:34:18,596 --> 00:34:20,356
It's not that easy.

400
00:34:20,496 --> 00:34:22,186
In my experience...

401
00:34:22,296 --> 00:34:23,316
Study!

402
00:34:24,466 --> 00:34:25,196
Study!

403
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:28,756
Study!

404
00:34:49,656 --> 00:34:51,526
It just doesn't work for me.

405
00:34:51,626 --> 00:34:52,856
I'm not you.

406
00:34:58,936 --> 00:35:00,866
How'bout a drop of sake?

407
00:35:00,966 --> 00:35:01,626
Sure.

408
00:35:01,736 --> 00:35:03,256
But, dear.

409
00:35:11,616 --> 00:35:13,136
Pretty awful, huh?

410
00:35:15,716 --> 00:35:17,046
A little dry.

411
00:35:18,286 --> 00:35:19,276
What did you say!

412
00:35:19,416 --> 00:35:20,286
Have you been...

413
00:35:24,756 --> 00:35:25,686
Noboru!

414
00:35:25,796 --> 00:35:27,256
Noboru!

415
00:35:36,306 --> 00:35:39,136
Hey, Noboru, let's play catch.

416
00:35:40,846 --> 00:35:41,936
Why?

417
00:35:43,076 --> 00:35:47,346
Why...? It's a form of parent-child bonding.

418
00:35:48,516 --> 00:35:50,746
Then it doesn't have to be catch.

419
00:35:51,086 --> 00:35:53,276
I get your point, but...

420
00:35:54,586 --> 00:35:57,856
It's a matter of setting the right stage.

421
00:35:58,696 --> 00:36:00,716
Forget it. Can't be bothered.

422
00:36:15,576 --> 00:36:18,566
Kids these days...

423
00:36:24,816 --> 00:36:27,516
A serious generation gap...

424
00:36:31,526 --> 00:36:33,496
Paternal Supremacy Restored

425
00:36:36,966 --> 00:36:39,026
Don't mix your rice into the soup.

426
00:36:39,136 --> 00:36:40,686
Listen to your father.

427
00:36:41,606 --> 00:36:43,626
Pour the soup over the rice.

428
00:36:46,376 --> 00:36:48,276
Excuse me, father...

429
00:36:49,546 --> 00:36:51,006
What? Got a problem with that?

430
00:36:51,746 --> 00:36:53,376
Oh, suit yourself.

431
00:36:59,156 --> 00:37:02,126
See, the water after the cement.

432
00:37:02,526 --> 00:37:04,546
Um...

433
00:37:06,126 --> 00:37:07,356
Hmmm...

434
00:37:07,466 --> 00:37:09,726
Control those chopsticks. It's rude.

435
00:37:11,066 --> 00:37:13,656
Use your chopsticks with purpose.

436
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:17,156
That's my plate.

437
00:37:17,336 --> 00:37:18,666
Excuse me.

438
00:37:19,536 --> 00:37:21,936
You bit it, it's yours.

439
00:37:27,616 --> 00:37:30,586
Help me think of an independent study topic.

440
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:32,146
Think for yourself.

441
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:35,006
It's independent, free choice.

442
00:37:35,356 --> 00:37:38,756
I know, but I'm coming up blank.

443
00:37:39,826 --> 00:37:42,026
You're free to do anything?

444
00:37:42,126 --> 00:37:43,566
Right, free.

445
00:37:43,666 --> 00:37:44,856
But...

446
00:37:45,796 --> 00:37:50,736
Total freedom makes it tough, doesn't it?

447
00:37:50,836 --> 00:37:52,596
Exactly.

448
00:37:54,446 --> 00:37:55,936
Freedom, huh...

449
00:38:06,116 --> 00:38:09,386
Absolute freedom of choice...

450
00:38:14,996 --> 00:38:19,366
Glorious freedom... I dream of freedom...

451
00:38:19,736 --> 00:38:22,926
But when it comes on a silver platter...

452
00:38:27,746 --> 00:38:30,076
I haven't got a clue what to do...

453
00:38:35,546 --> 00:38:37,676
Now he's a philosopher.

454
00:38:37,986 --> 00:38:41,186
He's probably worrying about his own retirement.

455
00:38:42,226 --> 00:38:44,216
Father as Role Model

456
00:38:56,966 --> 00:38:58,526
The first snow!

457
00:39:11,186 --> 00:39:13,156
Let's take a picture in it!

458
00:39:13,916 --> 00:39:15,476
Why?

459
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:17,386
You're hardly children anymore.

460
00:39:17,486 --> 00:39:19,486
Shut the door. It's cold.

461
00:39:46,656 --> 00:39:47,986
Where's the camera?

462
00:39:48,526 --> 00:39:51,426
In the top drawer.

463
00:39:57,866 --> 00:39:58,836
Is not!

464
00:40:03,566 --> 00:40:05,696
You should know where it is.

465
00:40:07,846 --> 00:40:09,836
This is the best part...

466
00:41:11,276 --> 00:41:14,336
A lone figure Back turned

467
00:41:20,516 --> 00:41:22,486
Yamada Family Chronicles

468
00:41:26,086 --> 00:41:28,346
Happy New Year

469
00:41:28,826 --> 00:41:30,416
New Year's Cards

470
00:41:33,826 --> 00:41:34,816
Ready!

471
00:41:35,926 --> 00:41:36,756
Go!

472
00:41:36,866 --> 00:41:37,596
Mine, mine,

473
00:41:37,696 --> 00:41:38,756
Mother's, Matsuko's, Nonoko's...

474
00:41:55,686 --> 00:41:58,046
31 seconds! A new record.

475
00:41:59,656 --> 00:42:00,876
Not bad.

476
00:42:04,996 --> 00:42:06,756
The Thick of Winter

477
00:42:12,796 --> 00:42:14,066
Time to get up.

478
00:42:14,166 --> 00:42:15,656
Dad, can you get me some cake?

479
00:42:15,766 --> 00:42:16,736
Coke for me.

480
00:42:16,836 --> 00:42:17,696
The tangerines, too.

481
00:42:17,806 --> 00:42:20,136
And the stove needs kerosene.

482
00:42:22,846 --> 00:42:25,246
Thank you!

483
00:42:36,486 --> 00:42:38,316
Spring Showers

484
00:42:39,656 --> 00:42:41,646
Can you bring my umbrella?

485
00:42:41,766 --> 00:42:45,056
Your father needs his umbrella at the station.

486
00:42:45,336 --> 00:42:48,326
Why me? I'm studying.

487
00:42:48,436 --> 00:42:51,896
You should go. Walk in the rain with your man.

488
00:42:52,006 --> 00:42:54,476
I just don't have the energy today.

489
00:42:54,576 --> 00:42:55,476
But...

490
00:42:55,576 --> 00:42:58,876
Noboru! You go, please.

491
00:42:58,976 --> 00:43:00,306
Make Nonoko go.

492
00:43:00,416 --> 00:43:02,716
Forget it! I'll buy one.

493
00:43:02,816 --> 00:43:05,016
Pick up some pork, too?

494
00:43:05,356 --> 00:43:06,246
No Way!

495
00:44:36,606 --> 00:44:39,806
Strange... Where's Noboru's sock...

496
00:44:39,916 --> 00:44:43,176
Nonoko's pajamas and Dad's towel?

497
00:44:43,816 --> 00:44:45,446
Pajamas? Socks?

498
00:44:45,556 --> 00:44:47,146
And his towel.

499
00:44:50,926 --> 00:44:52,446
Hey, wait...

500
00:44:54,256 --> 00:44:56,056
This means...

501
00:45:02,466 --> 00:45:04,696
I knew it!

502
00:45:04,836 --> 00:45:06,736
The Black Hole!

503
00:45:07,306 --> 00:45:09,296
The Perfect Combo

504
00:45:10,546 --> 00:45:13,706
Maybe we'll order sushi in for dinner...

505
00:45:15,086 --> 00:45:19,676
Oh, what a waste of money! I'll make the sushi.

506
00:45:20,056 --> 00:45:21,886
Just as I hoped...

507
00:45:26,496 --> 00:45:28,616
Say, mother...

508
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:32,626
Sushi's not interesting. I thought I'd go gourmet.

509
00:45:33,166 --> 00:45:37,396
I see...So what is it?

510
00:45:37,506 --> 00:45:40,336
Beef Stroganoga...

511
00:45:40,436 --> 00:45:42,606
Don't cook what you can't spell.

512
00:45:42,706 --> 00:45:44,106
Well, excuse me!

513
00:45:45,816 --> 00:45:49,046
It's Beef Stroganoff, right?

514
00:45:49,316 --> 00:45:51,076
You knew all along.

515
00:45:51,616 --> 00:45:53,086
I know very well.

516
00:45:53,456 --> 00:45:58,016
Beef Stroganoga is just the Strogaffgaff of beef.

517
00:45:58,126 --> 00:46:00,596
Whatever, just make it.

518
00:46:01,896 --> 00:46:05,196
Darn. I was really counting on sushi.

519
00:46:20,216 --> 00:46:23,976
No good. I screwed it up. Order the sushi.

520
00:46:24,546 --> 00:46:26,546
Breakfast of Champions

521
00:46:30,186 --> 00:46:33,056
Wow, miso soup, fried egg and seaweed.

522
00:46:34,196 --> 00:46:36,526
A real Japanese breakfast.

523
00:46:36,626 --> 00:46:38,686
Well, actually...

524
00:46:41,336 --> 00:46:42,806
Nonoko's leftovers?

525
00:46:44,906 --> 00:46:45,926
Yesterday's soup?

526
00:46:47,506 --> 00:46:48,876
Extra seaweed from lunch?

527
00:46:50,076 --> 00:46:51,736
Precisely!

528
00:46:52,916 --> 00:46:55,206
Today's your lucky day.

529
00:46:55,316 --> 00:46:56,616
Hardly!

530
00:46:59,286 --> 00:47:00,756
Take care.

531
00:47:03,186 --> 00:47:04,516
Matsuko...

532
00:47:13,696 --> 00:47:16,396
When's lunch, Matsuko?

533
00:47:18,306 --> 00:47:22,936
What are you talking about? We just ate.

534
00:47:23,406 --> 00:47:25,676
You're too young to be senile.

535
00:47:26,116 --> 00:47:27,406
You sure...?

536
00:47:27,516 --> 00:47:31,476
The noodles, a few... Oops!

537
00:47:34,756 --> 00:47:36,886
I ate them all myself...

538
00:47:36,986 --> 00:47:37,956
Hey!

539
00:47:45,666 --> 00:47:47,066
What's for dinner?

540
00:47:47,496 --> 00:47:48,726
Shabu shabu.

541
00:47:50,966 --> 00:47:53,306
We have it all the time.

542
00:47:53,406 --> 00:47:55,966
Shabu shabu's perfect for winter.

543
00:47:59,846 --> 00:48:01,936
OK, help yourselves.

544
00:48:02,746 --> 00:48:05,446
This way, she doesn't have to cook.

545
00:48:06,286 --> 00:48:06,316
Cold noodles for lunch again?

546
00:48:06,316 --> 00:48:08,806
Cold noodles for lunch again?

547
00:48:08,926 --> 00:48:10,686
That's what we had yesterday!

548
00:48:10,786 --> 00:48:13,086
And the day before.

549
00:48:13,196 --> 00:48:14,786
That doesn't make sense!

550
00:48:16,126 --> 00:48:18,396
And again tomorrow!?

551
00:48:18,566 --> 00:48:22,026
Noodles! What else?

552
00:48:22,936 --> 00:48:25,866
Lots of free ginger in the garden to go with it.

553
00:48:27,306 --> 00:48:29,296
Ginger Morning

554
00:48:31,776 --> 00:48:34,646
The ginger's good in miso soup.

555
00:48:34,746 --> 00:48:39,516
Yes, though they do say it makes you forgetful.

556
00:48:40,286 --> 00:48:42,816
Oh dear. He left his bag.

557
00:48:43,656 --> 00:48:46,816
He's bound to notice. He can't be that dumb.

558
00:48:47,396 --> 00:48:48,226
Right.

559
00:48:48,326 --> 00:48:49,886
Oh, no, I forgot...

560
00:48:59,706 --> 00:49:01,766
...to take of my pajamas!

561
00:49:06,446 --> 00:49:07,306
I'm off.

562
00:49:07,416 --> 00:49:08,476
OK.

563
00:49:10,886 --> 00:49:12,346
Have a nice day.

564
00:49:17,056 --> 00:49:18,316
I'm off.

565
00:49:21,496 --> 00:49:22,726
My shoes!

566
00:49:27,136 --> 00:49:28,496
Mom, look!

567
00:49:29,866 --> 00:49:30,896
Dad!

568
00:49:31,236 --> 00:49:32,936
What's all the fuss!

569
00:49:33,676 --> 00:49:34,366
My train!

570
00:49:34,476 --> 00:49:35,706
I'll be late!

571
00:49:36,446 --> 00:49:38,136
Be careful.

572
00:49:41,646 --> 00:49:43,476
I'm off to school.

573
00:49:43,916 --> 00:49:45,886
Off you go...

574
00:49:46,986 --> 00:49:50,946
Can't even close the door behind them.

575
00:50:00,496 --> 00:50:01,836
What's this?

576
00:50:01,936 --> 00:50:04,696
Oh, Nonoko forgot her lunch.

577
00:50:04,806 --> 00:50:06,326
She needs it by noon?

578
00:50:06,436 --> 00:50:08,166
Sure, but...

579
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:12,066
Fine, I'll take it to her when I go shopping.

580
00:50:12,176 --> 00:50:14,666
That'll really be a help.

581
00:50:19,556 --> 00:50:20,886
I'm off.

582
00:50:20,986 --> 00:50:23,426
OK. Thank you.

583
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:30,186
What's this?

584
00:50:33,166 --> 00:50:36,656
Oh, no, she's forgotten her purse and everything.

585
00:50:40,276 --> 00:50:41,706
She'll be back.

586
00:50:46,516 --> 00:50:48,576
Watch the house, OK?

587
00:50:53,316 --> 00:50:56,216
Oh no! I left the kettle on.

588
00:51:00,926 --> 00:51:03,896
Mrs. Yamada, delivery!

589
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:07,426
Are they out?

590
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:12,196
No, they're in.

591
00:51:13,076 --> 00:51:14,626
Oh, Mrs. Yamada.

592
00:51:19,276 --> 00:51:21,906
Oh, I did turn it off.

593
00:51:22,586 --> 00:51:24,646
Were you robbed?

594
00:51:35,766 --> 00:51:37,286
Here's your package.

595
00:51:38,766 --> 00:51:40,666
Oh, thank you.

596
00:51:41,496 --> 00:51:42,326
Your seal...?

597
00:51:42,436 --> 00:51:43,906
Oh, sorry.

598
00:51:44,306 --> 00:51:48,206
Let's see... Where do I keep it?

599
00:51:48,306 --> 00:51:51,866
It's in the back of the second drawer.

600
00:51:51,976 --> 00:51:53,806
Oh, goodness...

601
00:51:55,746 --> 00:51:57,276
Always a pleasure.

602
00:51:57,386 --> 00:51:58,616
Thank you.

603
00:52:02,086 --> 00:52:04,786
I delivered Nonoko's lunch.

604
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:09,296
Why mother, I thought you were going shopping.

605
00:52:09,566 --> 00:52:12,296
Oops, I forgot.

606
00:52:15,166 --> 00:52:17,936
Too much ginger...!

607
00:52:19,476 --> 00:52:22,446
Regret

608
00:52:36,786 --> 00:52:37,756
Say...

609
00:52:41,696 --> 00:52:43,526
Is it Mahler...

610
00:52:45,796 --> 00:52:50,326
I didn't know she was a classical music fan...

611
00:53:09,256 --> 00:53:12,746
Art is Brief Life is Long

612
00:53:18,126 --> 00:53:20,256
They're in full bloom.

613
00:53:24,836 --> 00:53:29,036
I wonder how many more times I'll see the cherry blossoms.

614
00:53:29,946 --> 00:53:34,646
Don't be silly, mother. You're only 70.

615
00:53:35,516 --> 00:53:38,146
Maybe 30 more...

616
00:53:50,493 --> 00:53:53,193
Mom, will you go pay the taxes?

617
00:53:53,293 --> 00:53:54,523
Leave it to me.

618
00:53:56,903 --> 00:53:59,063
You hand it to the clerk, got that?

619
00:53:59,173 --> 00:54:02,263
I know. Don't treat me like a child.

620
00:54:07,073 --> 00:54:11,103
Oh, dear, what a terrible calamity...

621
00:54:12,253 --> 00:54:14,483
I'm really going senile.

622
00:54:15,583 --> 00:54:16,953
Nice to see you.

623
00:54:17,053 --> 00:54:19,353
Take care, bye.

624
00:54:23,723 --> 00:54:26,023
I put it in the mail box!

625
00:54:32,633 --> 00:54:37,193
Why, Shige... Thanks for coming to visit.

626
00:54:37,473 --> 00:54:40,913
Well, I heard you were suddenly hospitalized.

627
00:54:41,113 --> 00:54:44,173
You'll never believe it...

628
00:54:44,543 --> 00:54:46,343
Have a seat.

629
00:54:54,623 --> 00:54:55,653
You see...

630
00:54:55,763 --> 00:54:56,783
Yes.

631
00:54:58,363 --> 00:54:59,423
Look.

632
00:55:00,363 --> 00:55:03,563
See the guy visiting that patient over there?

633
00:55:04,003 --> 00:55:07,463
I'm sure they're having an affair.

634
00:55:07,573 --> 00:55:08,933
What!

635
00:55:11,943 --> 00:55:13,573
Are you...?

636
00:55:13,843 --> 00:55:18,643
They definitely look suspicious to me!

637
00:55:22,123 --> 00:55:24,213
Suspicious, right?

638
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:30,753
This is a special room.

639
00:55:30,863 --> 00:55:35,353
That notorious city councilman
accused of corruption is in there now.

640
00:55:39,533 --> 00:55:43,493
I occasionally come up here for a breath of fresh air.

641
00:55:50,543 --> 00:55:53,643
These noodles are pretty good, right?

642
00:55:54,583 --> 00:55:55,783
They are.

643
00:56:00,293 --> 00:56:05,193
But the coffee's really lousy here.

644
00:56:06,893 --> 00:56:11,133
By the way, why are you in the hospital?

645
00:56:18,143 --> 00:56:19,703
Oh, Shige...!

646
00:56:25,883 --> 00:56:31,153
No sign of death's approach
In the ciccada's voices - Basho

647
00:56:36,963 --> 00:56:38,793
Why, mother.

648
00:56:41,433 --> 00:56:42,793
Turn on the light.

649
00:56:43,703 --> 00:56:47,463
Oh, I hadn't noticed it getting dark.

650
00:56:58,753 --> 00:57:02,273
Noboru! Turn off your light.

651
00:57:02,383 --> 00:57:03,713
I'm not asleep!

652
00:57:05,923 --> 00:57:08,893
Age Comes More Easily Than Wisdom

653
00:57:09,923 --> 00:57:13,693
Five problems left. I'm so sleepy.

654
00:57:15,933 --> 00:57:18,923
A hot bath will wake you up.

655
00:57:35,153 --> 00:57:36,123
In you go.

656
00:57:43,763 --> 00:57:44,693
Feel better?

657
00:57:44,863 --> 00:57:46,853
Yup! I'm wide awake.

658
00:57:49,703 --> 00:57:53,363
OK, here goes!

659
00:57:54,033 --> 00:57:57,263
Here goes, here goes...

660
00:57:58,243 --> 00:57:59,863
Here...goes...

661
00:58:09,783 --> 00:58:13,723
You're as limp as a noodle.

662
00:58:15,153 --> 00:58:17,423
Don't give up.

663
00:58:17,593 --> 00:58:22,463
In a fire, the first 5 minutes count.
In a test, it's the last 5 minutes.

664
00:58:29,843 --> 00:58:33,703
Time's up. Turn in your papers.

665
00:58:37,813 --> 00:58:39,003
Ma'm!

666
00:58:39,483 --> 00:58:42,883
Tanaka felt sick and had to go to the nurse's office!

667
00:58:43,323 --> 00:58:44,413
Yes...

668
00:58:44,623 --> 00:58:46,783
We deserve make-up time!

669
00:58:47,793 --> 00:58:48,913
Forget it.

670
00:58:54,493 --> 00:58:56,933
Put them in the upstairs closet?

671
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:57,893
Sure.

672
00:59:26,263 --> 00:59:28,893
Noboru's studying like a demon.

673
00:59:29,803 --> 00:59:33,163
But the exams are over.

674
00:59:33,273 --> 00:59:35,033
He did miserably.

675
00:59:46,813 --> 00:59:49,683
About Noboru's tutor.

676
00:59:50,183 --> 00:59:51,673
He really needs one?

677
00:59:52,123 --> 00:59:54,053
He's my son, after all.

678
00:59:54,153 --> 00:59:55,553
You've got a point.

679
00:59:58,693 --> 01:00:02,493
But isn't it expensive?

680
01:00:02,903 --> 01:00:06,703
$300 for 2 sessions with a university student.

681
01:00:06,803 --> 01:00:08,273
What!

682
01:00:09,103 --> 01:00:11,373
For $300, I'll teach him.

683
01:00:11,473 --> 01:00:14,173
I'll teach him for $200.

684
01:00:15,643 --> 01:00:18,083
Pay me $100 and I'll work harder!

685
01:00:21,253 --> 01:00:24,553
This is getting us nowhere...

686
01:00:30,223 --> 01:00:37,633
Fleeting dreams An octopus making its home
in a trap A summer moon - Basho

687
01:00:44,943 --> 01:00:46,063
I'm home!

688
01:00:53,183 --> 01:00:54,743
Look, chocolates!

689
01:00:56,923 --> 01:01:02,123
Mommy! Noboru bought chocolates!

690
01:01:02,363 --> 01:01:04,983
They were a Valentine's Day present!

691
01:01:06,233 --> 01:01:08,223
Adolescence

692
01:01:08,863 --> 01:01:09,733
Gone!

693
01:01:10,303 --> 01:01:11,893
Gone, gone, gone!

694
01:01:12,003 --> 01:01:13,233
I'm home!

695
01:01:14,433 --> 01:01:16,903
Where are those cookies, Nonoko!

696
01:01:17,043 --> 01:01:18,093
I ate them.

697
01:01:18,303 --> 01:01:21,643
What! I got them for a girl!

698
01:01:21,743 --> 01:01:22,943
But...

699
01:01:23,043 --> 01:01:24,573
No ifs ands or buts!

700
01:01:24,883 --> 01:01:27,743
Mommy already ate half.

701
01:01:27,853 --> 01:01:29,343
Mother...?

702
01:01:39,933 --> 01:01:42,863
Damn...I forgot my umbrella.

703
01:01:43,163 --> 01:01:44,533
Hey, Yamada!

704
01:01:45,503 --> 01:01:46,993
Use my umbrella.

705
01:01:47,373 --> 01:01:48,533
How'bout you?

706
01:01:48,633 --> 01:01:49,863
I'll be fine.

707
01:01:51,773 --> 01:01:54,873
Say, Tanaka, I forgot my umbrella!

708
01:01:55,683 --> 01:01:58,143
Too bad. Don't catch cold.

709
01:02:06,953 --> 01:02:08,423
Rejected.

710
01:02:10,163 --> 01:02:11,053
No!

711
01:02:13,063 --> 01:02:14,083
Give it back!

712
01:02:14,193 --> 01:02:15,253
Not after that.

713
01:02:15,363 --> 01:02:16,493
But it's mine.

714
01:02:16,603 --> 01:02:17,593
Thanks for the favor.

715
01:02:17,703 --> 01:02:18,823
Give it back!

716
01:02:19,433 --> 01:02:21,133
Guess it's a rain date.

717
01:02:25,943 --> 01:02:27,503
Hey, Nakamura.

718
01:02:27,713 --> 01:02:29,543
Back to sock the teacher?

719
01:02:29,813 --> 01:02:33,543
Don't be stupid. I came to tell him I got into college.

720
01:02:34,113 --> 01:02:35,983
Wow, you made it!

721
01:02:41,993 --> 01:02:43,013
Sir...?

722
01:02:43,123 --> 01:02:44,323
No need to run...

723
01:02:44,693 --> 01:02:45,823
from Nakamura.

724
01:02:45,933 --> 01:02:48,693
Idiot! Don't believe the rumors.

725
01:02:50,633 --> 01:02:52,433
Hey, Yamada, Yamashita,

726
01:02:53,103 --> 01:02:54,933
let's buy some dirty books.

727
01:03:07,983 --> 01:03:08,913
Hey!

728
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:10,653
Shoot!

729
01:03:12,723 --> 01:03:13,983
What a coincidence.

730
01:03:18,023 --> 01:03:22,093
Tragedy in Bosnia...! You've got serious taste.

731
01:03:22,193 --> 01:03:25,433
Well, Japan's part of a bigger world.

732
01:03:27,403 --> 01:03:29,333
Can I borrow it later?

733
01:03:32,143 --> 01:03:33,873
A real tragedy...

734
01:03:37,183 --> 01:03:38,343
I'm home.

735
01:03:40,913 --> 01:03:41,883
Noboru,

736
01:03:43,383 --> 01:03:44,753
the textbook?

737
01:03:44,853 --> 01:03:45,753
This?

738
01:03:46,193 --> 01:03:48,313
I gave you $10 for it.

739
01:03:48,593 --> 01:03:49,953
I want to see it.

740
01:04:07,773 --> 01:04:09,303
'F-1 Racing for Students'

741
01:04:09,413 --> 01:04:11,003
What is this!

742
01:04:12,213 --> 01:04:14,943
'Formula-1 Racing for Students'?

743
01:04:15,053 --> 01:04:18,383
It'll help my English and my geography.

744
01:04:20,253 --> 01:04:21,183
You idiot!

745
01:04:21,923 --> 01:04:23,683
You're the one who gave me

746
01:04:23,793 --> 01:04:27,423
'The Power Ranger's ABC' when I was 3!

747
01:04:28,233 --> 01:04:31,493
Noboru, there's a girl on the phone.

748
01:04:31,603 --> 01:04:32,833
What!

749
01:04:39,513 --> 01:04:40,603
Oh, hello...

750
01:04:41,643 --> 01:04:43,073
Oh, yeah, it's me...

751
01:04:54,323 --> 01:04:55,983
Go away!

752
01:04:58,963 --> 01:05:01,653
Oh, no, nothing.

753
01:05:03,403 --> 01:05:07,063
Yeah, yeah, OK.

754
01:05:10,473 --> 01:05:12,493
A girlfriend...with his looks?

755
01:05:12,613 --> 01:05:13,803
A real girlfriend?

756
01:05:13,913 --> 01:05:15,243
His face is red.

757
01:05:15,783 --> 01:05:17,443
Yeah, OK.

758
01:05:17,813 --> 01:05:19,643
Bye, then.

759
01:05:31,793 --> 01:05:33,623
It's pounding away!

760
01:05:33,733 --> 01:05:34,923
An irregular heartbeat?

761
01:05:35,033 --> 01:05:36,263
Let's see.

762
01:05:47,473 --> 01:05:48,963
Do you think he's upset?

763
01:05:49,073 --> 01:05:51,873
You insulted him, mother.

764
01:05:51,983 --> 01:05:55,313
This, from the paragon of motherhood?

765
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:49,863
The scent of plums On a mountain path
Suddenly dawn - Basho

766
01:06:50,203 --> 01:06:52,173
Yamada Family Chronicles

767
01:06:54,613 --> 01:06:56,043
I'm home...

768
01:06:56,183 --> 01:06:57,803
Welcome back.

769
01:07:00,253 --> 01:07:02,083
An Autumn Night

770
01:07:08,793 --> 01:07:10,023
I'm hungry.

771
01:07:12,193 --> 01:07:13,393
Anything to eat?

772
01:07:13,993 --> 01:07:15,153
Coming right up.

773
01:07:22,903 --> 01:07:24,963
Red bean cake or banana.

774
01:07:28,273 --> 01:07:32,843
Who the hell would want to come home to bean cakes

775
01:07:33,383 --> 01:07:35,683
after working hard all day!

776
01:07:37,283 --> 01:07:38,843
OK, a banana.

777
01:07:39,393 --> 01:07:43,193
What a jerk! Who wants a banana!

778
01:09:32,873 --> 01:09:39,573
Turn towards me I'm lonely too The autumn dusk - Basho

779
01:09:41,713 --> 01:09:45,443
Mom's down with a cold. We'll get take-out tonight.

780
01:09:45,543 --> 01:09:46,203
Seaweed-rice special.

781
01:09:46,313 --> 01:09:47,403
Me too!

782
01:09:47,513 --> 01:09:48,743
I'll have the salmon-rice.

783
01:09:49,583 --> 01:09:51,073
How'bout you, mother?

784
01:09:51,453 --> 01:09:52,973
The combination special.

785
01:09:54,923 --> 01:09:56,153
I'll go get it!

786
01:09:56,263 --> 01:09:57,923
Not so fast!

787
01:10:01,763 --> 01:10:04,163
Tempura-rice for me!

788
01:10:04,263 --> 01:10:06,163
Going My Way

789
01:10:06,303 --> 01:10:09,273
Croquet Tournament

790
01:10:09,773 --> 01:10:11,203
That's good.

791
01:10:13,473 --> 01:10:15,463
Hey, hey, lady...

792
01:10:17,143 --> 01:10:18,773
You can't do that!

793
01:10:19,313 --> 01:10:21,783
What? But this is...

794
01:10:22,653 --> 01:10:26,683
It's empty now, but someone may put a poster up.
There's an election.

795
01:10:26,793 --> 01:10:28,913
But, mister...

796
01:10:31,563 --> 01:10:33,893
This was the only thing underneath.

797
01:10:41,703 --> 01:10:44,403
If it isn't old Saburo...

798
01:10:46,443 --> 01:10:48,873
This is my territory.

799
01:10:49,113 --> 01:10:51,773
Oh, it's you, Shige.

800
01:10:52,043 --> 01:10:55,143
We might as well work together, we're volunteers.

801
01:11:00,553 --> 01:11:03,423
You're on that side, I'm on this.

802
01:11:04,893 --> 01:11:06,483
Don't cross over.

803
01:11:06,763 --> 01:11:11,063
Oh, boy, she hasn't changed a bit in 60 years.

804
01:11:13,573 --> 01:11:16,933
Oh, no, I forgot to take out the garbage...

805
01:11:20,013 --> 01:11:22,063
Oh, well, I'll have to sort it!

806
01:11:22,173 --> 01:11:25,703
Why sort burnables?

807
01:11:26,913 --> 01:11:28,743
Trash can at the station,

808
01:11:28,853 --> 01:11:31,873
Nonoko does the park, Noboru does the store.

809
01:11:32,683 --> 01:11:33,843
You can't do that!

810
01:11:33,953 --> 01:11:36,443
Why not? It's a great plan.

811
01:11:36,793 --> 01:11:37,453
Off we go.

812
01:11:37,563 --> 01:11:39,083
See you later.

813
01:11:41,193 --> 01:11:41,993
Ouch!

814
01:11:42,233 --> 01:11:46,633
Here I volunteer cleaning up the park
and you dump trash there!

815
01:11:46,733 --> 01:11:49,963
I'm not dumping, just using the public trash cans.

816
01:11:50,273 --> 01:11:51,903
That's the problem!

817
01:11:52,003 --> 01:11:54,003
Mom...

818
01:12:08,753 --> 01:12:10,753
The Fight for Justice

819
01:12:11,293 --> 01:12:12,523
Excuse us!

820
01:12:15,563 --> 01:12:17,363
Our ball fell in...

821
01:12:21,703 --> 01:12:26,503
This new one or this rubber ball?

822
01:12:28,543 --> 01:12:30,033
The rubber ball!

823
01:12:40,423 --> 01:12:43,823
Honesty's the best policy. Don't ever lie.

824
01:12:44,593 --> 01:12:45,563
OK.

825
01:12:46,263 --> 01:12:47,893
Take this one too.

826
01:12:49,063 --> 01:12:50,363
Wow! Thanks!

827
01:12:58,243 --> 01:13:01,503
Excuse me... Our ball fell in yesterday...

828
01:13:01,613 --> 01:13:02,973
But you weren't here.

829
01:13:03,083 --> 01:13:05,543
Didn't see any.

830
01:13:06,553 --> 01:13:07,843
I see...

831
01:13:09,153 --> 01:13:11,983
I'm sure this was the house.

832
01:13:17,093 --> 01:13:22,253
I beg you, please tell those boys
to give him his new ball back.

833
01:13:28,873 --> 01:13:31,033
Oh, poor things.

834
01:13:31,143 --> 01:13:34,973
You're right, they're all wilted.

835
01:13:35,573 --> 01:13:38,413
Not the flowers! The accident!

836
01:13:38,643 --> 01:13:40,043
Oh, I see.

837
01:13:40,713 --> 01:13:42,773
It was a motor cycle gang.

838
01:13:44,083 --> 01:13:46,983
The poor guard rail.

839
01:13:47,093 --> 01:13:48,143
Mother!

840
01:13:48,253 --> 01:13:52,383
It was the poor child's parents who suffered...

841
01:14:26,263 --> 01:14:29,233
They're so loud, has to be a motorcycle gang.

842
01:14:29,593 --> 01:14:31,153
They're by the park.

843
01:14:31,633 --> 01:14:34,463
They're the litterbugs!

844
01:14:34,573 --> 01:14:35,933
I'll go scold them.

845
01:14:36,033 --> 01:14:37,833
That's dangerous, mother!

846
01:14:37,943 --> 01:14:40,633
Someone was recently murdered for that.

847
01:14:40,743 --> 01:14:42,733
Senior Citizen Murdered

848
01:14:43,183 --> 01:14:45,233
Hmm, I know.

849
01:14:53,993 --> 01:14:55,723
That's worse!

850
01:15:03,933 --> 01:15:07,063
Mm...mother! Why the get up?

851
01:15:07,333 --> 01:15:10,103
Says she's scolding the motorcycle gang.

852
01:15:10,203 --> 01:15:12,433
Won't you stop her, please.

853
01:15:13,013 --> 01:15:18,943
You can't wear that hard-hat.
It's a momento from when we built the house.

854
01:15:19,413 --> 01:15:22,443
Oh. Well that's too bad.

855
01:15:22,653 --> 01:15:25,583
I'm sorry, but you can't.

856
01:15:25,983 --> 01:15:27,143
In that case,

857
01:15:27,253 --> 01:15:29,653
you wear it and go.

858
01:15:29,823 --> 01:15:31,313
I go!?

859
01:15:32,123 --> 01:15:36,823
They're not vicious. They'll go home eventually.

860
01:15:37,033 --> 01:15:39,793
Then you have nothing to fear.

861
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:43,463
Give them a manly scolding. You're older.

862
01:15:44,003 --> 01:15:44,993
Manly...?

863
01:15:45,103 --> 01:15:46,873
But mother...

864
01:15:46,973 --> 01:15:49,343
I know, let's report them to 911.

865
01:15:49,443 --> 01:15:53,843
The poor kids. They don't deserve
a criminal record for making noise.

866
01:15:54,153 --> 01:15:55,373
A record!

867
01:16:12,233 --> 01:16:13,823
See, they're gone.

868
01:16:14,903 --> 01:16:16,273
You think?

869
01:16:26,513 --> 01:16:27,773
What did I tell you?

870
01:16:30,853 --> 01:16:32,753
We're relying on you.

871
01:16:36,493 --> 01:16:38,723
All right, I'll just go look.

872
01:16:41,193 --> 01:16:43,593
Be careful, dear!

873
01:17:31,683 --> 01:17:33,773
Um, excuse me...

874
01:17:34,213 --> 01:17:35,613
What do you want?

875
01:17:35,713 --> 01:17:38,483
It's awfully late.

876
01:17:38,823 --> 01:17:40,153
Yeah? So what?

877
01:17:43,423 --> 01:17:45,053
Got a problem?

878
01:17:45,163 --> 01:17:48,923
N, no, we can work this out. I don't have a problem...

879
01:17:49,263 --> 01:17:54,323
I don't have a problem, but I do have a request.

880
01:17:54,573 --> 01:17:55,563
Spit it out.

881
01:17:57,373 --> 01:17:59,173
Ask away, old man.

882
01:18:00,073 --> 01:18:02,803
Would you mind turning off your headlight.

883
01:18:03,043 --> 01:18:05,813
So that's your request, then?

884
01:18:06,883 --> 01:18:07,783
Um, n, no.

885
01:18:07,883 --> 01:18:09,873
Whaddya want then?

886
01:18:14,853 --> 01:18:20,353
Come, come fireflies,
this water's bitter, this water's sweet

887
01:18:20,463 --> 01:18:21,693
What is that!

888
01:18:33,473 --> 01:18:34,903
That old bag's nuts.

889
01:18:35,513 --> 01:18:37,203
Mother, are you all right!?

890
01:18:40,953 --> 01:18:42,543
An old bag, huh?

891
01:18:42,783 --> 01:18:46,913
At least turn down that putt-putt.
You're a neighborhood nuisance.

892
01:18:47,123 --> 01:18:49,483
M, mother, you can't talk to these low-lifes.

893
01:18:49,593 --> 01:18:51,353
Who you calling low-life!

894
01:18:51,463 --> 01:18:53,953
How exciting!

895
01:18:54,063 --> 01:18:56,693
What a great voice, you have.

896
01:18:56,803 --> 01:18:58,233
Mother!

897
01:18:58,403 --> 01:19:02,063
And a fine face and physique to go with it.

898
01:19:02,173 --> 01:19:05,333
I bet people shut up when you talk.

899
01:19:05,673 --> 01:19:06,733
Get to the point!

900
01:19:07,373 --> 01:19:11,573
Really scary. You sure shut this guy up in a hurry.

901
01:19:11,683 --> 01:19:12,573
A cinch.

902
01:19:12,683 --> 01:19:18,013
When you yell at people,
it reminds me of a snake staring down a frog.

903
01:19:19,993 --> 01:19:25,823
It sure must be fun shutting people up
and ordering them around.

904
01:19:26,023 --> 01:19:26,753
It's OK.

905
01:19:26,863 --> 01:19:32,523
I know, why don't you employ your venom
in the cause of justice?

906
01:19:33,033 --> 01:19:34,023
What?

907
01:19:34,333 --> 01:19:38,273
Don't you like fighting for justice,
that Masked Rider stuff?

908
01:19:40,043 --> 01:19:41,513
Way old, granny.

909
01:19:41,613 --> 01:19:45,803
Of course, it's not exactly cool, is it? Nowadays,

910
01:19:45,983 --> 01:19:49,613
we turn a blind eye to every kind of misdeed.

911
01:19:49,713 --> 01:19:53,623
But I know you could do it. Because you're fearless.

912
01:19:55,423 --> 01:19:59,363
Someone tosses a cigarette butt or can from their car,

913
01:19:59,463 --> 01:20:03,153
you use that voice of yours, make'em pick it up.

914
01:20:04,263 --> 01:20:07,753
You see a kid causing trouble on the subway,

915
01:20:07,873 --> 01:20:10,703
you gently tap him on the shoulder.

916
01:20:11,303 --> 01:20:14,833
I'm sure anyone will do whatever you say.

917
01:20:14,943 --> 01:20:19,933
We'll all be so happy, we'll cheer you on.

918
01:20:22,853 --> 01:20:26,843
It's nice to be appreciated.

919
01:20:27,253 --> 01:20:29,743
While you're at it, scare off thugs,

920
01:20:29,853 --> 01:20:33,763
and take the bad guys' money.

921
01:20:35,233 --> 01:20:40,063
What do you say, will you heed an old bag's plea
and fight for justice?

922
01:20:40,233 --> 01:20:44,933
It'll be a whole lot better
than listening to me rant and rave.

923
01:20:47,143 --> 01:20:49,663
I think this old lady's nuts.

924
01:20:50,643 --> 01:20:52,373
No go?

925
01:20:52,613 --> 01:20:57,343
What a shame, with your godly attributes.

926
01:21:00,453 --> 01:21:01,443
Outta here!

927
01:21:09,093 --> 01:21:11,593
Think about fighting for justice!

928
01:21:17,343 --> 01:21:18,703
Hey, you forgot this.

929
01:21:30,823 --> 01:21:32,153
Did he get it?

930
01:21:32,253 --> 01:21:34,053
Mother!

931
01:21:47,773 --> 01:21:51,333
Noboru! Nonoko!

932
01:21:51,573 --> 01:21:53,333
Mother!

933
01:22:47,333 --> 01:22:50,233
It's the Masked Rider!

934
01:23:30,373 --> 01:23:32,463
The Masked Rider!

935
01:24:16,213 --> 01:24:18,383
Help...

936
01:24:28,193 --> 01:24:29,563
Mother!

937
01:24:30,193 --> 01:24:31,593
Noboru!

938
01:24:33,203 --> 01:24:34,963
Nonoko...

939
01:24:48,083 --> 01:24:51,383
Thank you, Masked Rider!

940
01:25:39,433 --> 01:25:45,103
How cruel A grasshopper
trapped Under a warrior's helmet - Basho

941
01:25:52,943 --> 01:25:54,043
I'm home.

942
01:25:54,253 --> 01:25:56,483
Did you bring your umbrella home?

943
01:25:57,383 --> 01:26:01,253
Your husband's home from work, exhausted, and

944
01:26:01,353 --> 01:26:05,583
all you can ask is'did you bring your umbrella home!'

945
01:26:05,693 --> 01:26:08,453
OK, OK. Welcome home. Have a hard day?

946
01:26:09,033 --> 01:26:10,493
Where's your umbrella?

947
01:26:11,403 --> 01:26:12,763
I forgot it.

948
01:26:18,573 --> 01:26:19,703
Welcome home.

949
01:26:19,803 --> 01:26:24,643
Look, I remembered to bring it home, so there, ha!

950
01:26:28,753 --> 01:26:31,723
What? Got a problem?

951
01:26:32,923 --> 01:26:36,653
But you didn't take an umbrella today.

952
01:26:38,763 --> 01:26:39,653
See?

953
01:26:40,793 --> 01:26:42,783
Section Chief Yamada

954
01:26:43,063 --> 01:26:44,393
I bought a cake.

955
01:26:44,503 --> 01:26:45,483
Really?

956
01:26:46,963 --> 01:26:49,403
Once in a blue moon...

957
01:26:50,203 --> 01:26:52,673
Guilty conscience?

958
01:26:52,773 --> 01:26:53,503
What was that!

959
01:26:53,603 --> 01:26:57,773
That's going too far.
Here Takashi's thoughtfully gone and...

960
01:26:57,883 --> 01:26:59,473
I even bought custard.

961
01:27:01,783 --> 01:27:03,513
Now that's suspicious.

962
01:27:07,253 --> 01:27:12,693
Nonoko! Noboru! Your father got cake!

963
01:27:19,663 --> 01:27:20,893
Where's Dad?

964
01:27:21,103 --> 01:27:23,003
On a business trip.

965
01:27:23,673 --> 01:27:25,103
But his briefcase...

966
01:27:26,503 --> 01:27:29,473
Oh no, he must've forgotten it.

967
01:27:29,613 --> 01:27:31,303
And his scarf and train pass.

968
01:27:32,983 --> 01:27:34,073
What? Oh, no!

969
01:27:34,613 --> 01:27:37,583
He was supposed to leave early.

970
01:27:37,683 --> 01:27:39,123
Father!

971
01:27:40,593 --> 01:27:41,883
Dear!

972
01:27:47,963 --> 01:27:48,933
Section Chief Yamada

973
01:27:49,493 --> 01:27:51,123
Mom must've overslept.

974
01:27:52,433 --> 01:27:56,423
She woke up late and thought Dad had already left.

975
01:27:56,573 --> 01:27:58,093
Oh, I see.

976
01:28:05,783 --> 01:28:08,013
B...b...briefcase!

977
01:28:08,453 --> 01:28:10,073
H...h...here!

978
01:28:10,783 --> 01:28:11,713
I'm off!

979
01:28:11,983 --> 01:28:13,953
Have a nice trip!

980
01:28:17,923 --> 01:28:19,953
Be careful!

981
01:28:24,003 --> 01:28:25,463
I can still make it.

982
01:28:53,393 --> 01:28:54,953
Are you OK?

983
01:29:07,273 --> 01:29:08,433
Phone, phone...

984
01:29:19,423 --> 01:29:21,783
I suddenly feel terrible...

985
01:29:25,393 --> 01:29:27,623
I can hardly breathe...

986
01:29:27,933 --> 01:29:30,923
Yes, yes, I'll get there.

987
01:29:31,703 --> 01:29:33,863
I'll crawl there if I have to...

988
01:29:34,333 --> 01:29:36,033
Please tell the client...

989
01:29:36,233 --> 01:29:39,903
Yes, yes, I'm terribly sorry...

990
01:29:44,743 --> 01:29:46,303
A slight fever.

991
01:29:47,353 --> 01:29:48,643
You should stay home.

992
01:29:49,883 --> 01:29:51,913
Before it gets worse.

993
01:29:52,023 --> 01:29:54,813
The company won't take care o you.

994
01:29:56,893 --> 01:30:00,353
You know, maybe I will. Make a long weekend of it.

995
01:30:00,463 --> 01:30:02,653
You should, you should.

996
01:30:02,763 --> 01:30:06,293
It's good to relax and enjoy some time at home.

997
01:30:22,613 --> 01:30:24,483
...What is it?

998
01:30:26,823 --> 01:30:30,513
I started feeling better,
the minute I decided to stay home.

999
01:30:31,023 --> 01:30:33,583
I guess I'll go in after all.

1000
01:30:47,673 --> 01:30:49,333
Take care, dear.

1001
01:31:57,073 --> 01:32:00,573
Next, Mr. Yamada will offer his congratulations.

1002
01:32:01,153 --> 01:32:03,613
Your notes, dear.

1003
01:32:09,923 --> 01:32:12,083
He's wound tight as a spring!

1004
01:32:19,803 --> 01:32:25,033
Um... This is a fine, auspicious day...

1005
01:32:29,473 --> 01:32:32,973
Cucumber, garbage bags, light bulbs

1006
01:32:46,363 --> 01:32:48,793
Life is full of surprises...

1007
01:32:54,673 --> 01:32:57,363
Now...that is, up until now...

1008
01:32:58,103 --> 01:33:00,903
things seemed to be just fine...

1009
01:33:02,343 --> 01:33:05,403
then suddenly, you're shoved off a cliff!

1010
01:33:05,583 --> 01:33:08,603
By...your trusted spouse,

1011
01:33:08,913 --> 01:33:11,913
of all people!

1012
01:33:12,983 --> 01:33:14,423
He means you.

1013
01:33:16,293 --> 01:33:19,623
But Ichiro and Kazuko...

1014
01:33:19,993 --> 01:33:24,323
You have to accept life as it comes.

1015
01:33:26,963 --> 01:33:30,463
Acceptance is the key to surviving

1016
01:33:30,573 --> 01:33:36,203
the worst situations,
without losing heart or breaking up.

1017
01:33:36,613 --> 01:33:38,473
Breaking up?!

1018
01:33:40,543 --> 01:33:42,573
Even the worst behavior...

1019
01:33:43,113 --> 01:33:48,073
can be accepted and forgiven if there is no malice.

1020
01:33:48,193 --> 01:33:51,213
In fact, must be forgiven so one can go on with life!

1021
01:33:51,693 --> 01:33:53,713
Gutsy speech!

1022
01:33:54,163 --> 01:33:59,463
It's not necessarily bad
to resign yourself to a situation.

1023
01:33:59,663 --> 01:34:01,963
In fact, it's essential.

1024
01:34:02,303 --> 01:34:05,063
A must for a happy family.

1025
01:34:05,173 --> 01:34:08,373
A must for facing life and getting on with it.

1026
01:34:10,143 --> 01:34:13,843
Though it may sound negative,

1027
01:34:14,383 --> 01:34:17,473
'acceptance'

1028
01:34:17,683 --> 01:34:22,383
is the only way out of totally unacceptable situations.

1029
01:34:25,363 --> 01:34:29,793
I didn't know he had it in him... What a man.

1030
01:34:37,803 --> 01:34:41,463
Um, well, that is, I mean.

1031
01:34:45,543 --> 01:34:48,643
So, my dear Ichiro and Kazuko,

1032
01:34:48,983 --> 01:34:51,973
congratulations on your wedding.

1033
01:34:53,523 --> 01:34:59,483
May you be a tough, harmonious couple.

1034
01:35:10,203 --> 01:35:18,173
When I grew up and fell in love
I asked my sweetheart, what lies ahead?

1035
01:35:19,513 --> 01:35:26,283
Will we have rainbows day after day?
Here's what my sweetheart said

1036
01:35:27,083 --> 01:35:33,513
Que sera sera, whatever will be, will be

1037
01:35:34,563 --> 01:35:44,873
the future's not ours to see
qu ser ser, qu ser ser

1038
01:35:47,243 --> 01:35:50,703
A skinhead cut would disguise your baldness.

1039
01:35:52,083 --> 01:35:53,133
Who asked you!

1040
01:35:53,843 --> 01:35:56,143
Don't you need dentures, mother?

1041
01:35:56,253 --> 01:35:57,083
Who asked you!

1042
01:35:57,183 --> 01:35:59,413
Cut it out! Both of you!

1043
01:35:59,523 --> 01:36:02,953
You're starting to look like a sumo wrestler.

1044
01:36:03,053 --> 01:36:03,713
You tell her!

1045
01:36:03,823 --> 01:36:04,913
How dare you!

1046
01:36:07,423 --> 01:36:11,453
You're setting a terrible example!
In front of the children.

1047
01:36:11,633 --> 01:36:14,333
I can't hear the TV!

1048
01:36:17,973 --> 01:36:20,443
I know why we're so peaceful.

1049
01:36:21,813 --> 01:36:24,833
Because all three of you are nuts.

1050
01:36:25,113 --> 01:36:25,843
How dare you!

1051
01:36:26,083 --> 01:36:27,443
How dare you!

1052
01:36:28,313 --> 01:36:31,013
If even one of you were normal,

1053
01:36:31,683 --> 01:36:33,623
it'd throw off the balance.

1054
01:36:52,343 --> 01:36:54,363
What's your motto?

1055
01:36:54,473 --> 01:36:55,603
Getting married?

1056
01:36:55,713 --> 01:36:56,933
Change jobs?

1057
01:36:58,583 --> 01:37:00,203
Be quiet...

1058
01:37:06,753 --> 01:37:07,983
This.

1059
01:37:10,123 --> 01:37:14,023
DON'T OVERDO IT

1060
01:38:27,703 --> 01:38:30,293
Hey, everybody's in the picture!

1061
01:38:30,403 --> 01:38:31,663
Let's see.

1062
01:38:31,773 --> 01:38:33,033
Everyone's so tiny.

1063
01:38:33,143 --> 01:38:34,603
It's a stick-on picture.

1064
01:38:37,513 --> 01:38:39,603
Time to get some dinner...

1065
01:38:39,713 --> 01:38:40,773
Let's have pork cutlets.

1066
01:38:40,883 --> 01:38:41,853
I want pizza!

1067
01:38:41,953 --> 01:38:42,743
Tempura.

1068
01:38:42,853 --> 01:38:43,403
Spaghetti!

1069
01:38:43,613 --> 01:38:45,453
Quiet! I decide!

1070
01:43:35,952 --> 01:43:39,663

1071
01:43:40,663 --> 01:43:50,663
