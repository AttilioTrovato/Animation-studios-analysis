1
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:00,610
Here it is.

2
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,820
May I borrow it?

3
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,330
It's in English.

4
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:10,830
I have a dictionary.

5
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,340
Very good. Give it a go.

6
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,350
Thank you.

7
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,760
Knock it off.

8
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,300
Butt out!

9
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,810
Better get going.

10
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:37,520
Jiro...

11
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,170
No more bullying, okay?

12
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,380
You look quite the hero.

13
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,750
I slipped and fell.

14
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,420
Fighting is never justified.

15
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,260
I know.

16
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,510
Go have your snack.

17
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,240
Thank you.

18
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:15,410
Big brother, you're back!

19
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,590
I was waiting for you.

20
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,880
Let's pick bamboo grass.

21
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,860
Big brother!

22
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,430
I want to pick bamboo grass.

23
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,750
You promised to go with me.

24
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,000
I've got homework.

25
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,340
That's not homework.

26
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,760
It's an English magazine.

27
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,760
What a stupid moustache.

28
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:55,770
He's a famous Italian
aircraft designer.

29
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,920
His name is Caproni.

30
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,770
It says he's a count.

31
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:02,770
Your face is scratched.

32
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:03,900
Leave it alone.

33
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,860
I better put some iodine on it.

34
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,200
Would you be quiet?

35
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,160
Big brother, what are you doing?

36
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,960
You're not allowed up here.

37
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,590
You're not wearing glasses.

38
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:27,410
Focusing on the stars.

39
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:29,990
It should improve my eyesight.

40
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,150
Mother will scold you.

41
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,970
A shooting star!

42
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:37,740
There's another one.

43
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,680
They're so pretty.

44
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,350
See? Like that.

45
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,840
There's so many of them.

46
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:25,020
I'm a Japanese boy.

47
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:33,200
I think this is my dream.

48
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,580
This is my dream, you know.

49
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,340
It's mine too.

50
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,050
Your dream?

51
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:57,530
Listen, Japanese boy.

52
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:00,600
You think we're sharing this dream?

53
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,060
It's strange.

54
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,720
You're Count Caproni, aren't you?

55
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,480
I'm very glad to meet you.

56
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,880
Interesting.

57
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,740
Yes, this is a dream.

58
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,110
This world is a dream.

59
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,200
Welcome to my kingdom.

60
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,760
I'm honored.

61
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,120
Look at them.

62
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:26,260
They will bomb the enemy city.

63
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,040
Most of them won't return.

64
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:37,280
But the war will soon be over.

65
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,480
Climb up, Japanese boy.

66
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,190
This is my dream.

67
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:54,860
When the war is over,
I will build this.

68
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,760
Magnificent, isn't she?

69
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,800
Let's fly.

70
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,560
Instead of bombs,
she'll carry passengers.

71
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,670
Of course we can't climb up here...

72
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,090
but dreams are convenient.

73
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,680
One can go anywhere.

74
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,320
Come, join me.

75
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,900
You can walk along the spar.

76
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:40,180
Take a look.

77
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,280
She's beautiful, no?

78
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,150
Yes, incredible.

79
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:27,490
She'll carry a hundred people
across the Atlantic.

80
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,510
Mr. Caproni?

81
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,750
I have a question.

82
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,250
Do you think I could
design airplanes?

83
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:41,760
I'll never be a pilot.
I'm too nearsighted.

84
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,590
Listen, Japanese boy.

85
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:48,930
I'm not a pilot.
I don't even know how to fly.

86
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,940
To fly airplanes is simple.

87
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,020
But I am a creator of airplanes.

88
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,670
An aeronautical engineer!

89
00:11:58,210 --> 00:11:59,190
Yes!

90
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:01,770
Listen to me, Japanese boy.

91
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:03,910
Airplanes are not tools for war.

92
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:06,080
They are not for making money.

93
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:08,910
Airplanes are beautiful dreams.

94
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:12,080
Engineers turn dreams into reality.

95
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,790
Yes!

96
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,690
Arrivederci. We'll meet again.

97
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:34,020
Jiro, you should go to bed.

98
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,930
You startled me.

99
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:39,780
I heard you talking to someone.

100
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:43,280
Mother, I'm going to be
an aeronautical engineer.

101
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,280
Really? That's a wonderful dream.

102
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:50,280
Airplanes are beautiful dreams.
That's what he told me.

103
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,660
I want to design beautiful airplanes.

104
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:24,110
You, there.
Come, take my seat.

105
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,320
Pardon me.

106
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,430
Please.

107
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,710
The wind feels wonderful.

108
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,780
Miss, you'll lose your hat.

109
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,910
Don't worry, Kinu.

110
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:18,900
Watch out!

111
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:18,900
Sweetie!

112
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:23,450
Are you all right?

113
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:25,030
Safe!

114
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:26,860
Nice play.

115
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,970
Thank you.

116
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,240
"Le vent se lève."

117
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,140
"Il faut tenter de vivre."

118
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,230
"Le vent se lève.
Il faut tenter de vivre."

119
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:07,610
"The wind is rising.
We must try to live."

120
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,100
An earthquake.

121
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,070
The boiler's going to blow!

122
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,290
What's wrong?

123
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:08,340
Her leg.

124
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,750
Show me.

125
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,220
It hurts.

126
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,630
Kinu, be brave.

127
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:15,930
It's broken.

128
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:17,300
She can't walk like this.

129
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,700
Miss, the boiler.

130
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,680
Please save yourself.

131
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,020
That's nonsense.

132
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,870
Nothing's going to explode.

133
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:29,380
My suitcase.

134
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:38,090
Now, try to relax.

135
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,180
She can't walk.

136
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,000
Where do you live?

137
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,220
In Ueno.

138
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,560
I'll get you there.

139
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,120
Fire.

140
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,310
Let's go.

141
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,240
What about your luggage?

142
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,370
It's not important.

143
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,510
I'm so sorry.

144
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,790
Hang on!

145
00:18:58,090 --> 00:18:59,340
We'd better hurry.

146
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,690
One of my shirts.
It's brand new.

147
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:48,370
You must be thirsty.

148
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,170
The well's almost dry.
What about you?

149
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:56,400
Thank you.

150
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:04,720
The fire hasn't reached Ueno.

151
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,430
I'm heading for the university.
What about you?

152
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:09,430
I'll bring someone from home.

153
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,770
I'll go with you.

154
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,100
Look after this, Kinu.

155
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:14,690
I will.

156
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:16,080
We'll be back soon.

157
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,150
Don't worry.

158
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,510
Watch my suitcase.

159
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,100
Thank you.

160
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,890
I'll leave her to you.

161
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:45,650
But what's your name?

162
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:51,530
That was some guy.

163
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:52,950
Don't you think, Kinu?

164
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,840
Jiro! You picked a great day
to come back.

165
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,550
How bad is it, Honjo?

166
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:18,040
The whole east side is burning.

167
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:22,610
That's everything we could carry.

168
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:24,010
Got a smoke?

169
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:30,700
That's just great.

170
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,260
A flying door.

171
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,690
The fire's unstoppable now.

172
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:35,350
Tokyo's finished.

173
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,880
He really built it.

174
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,890
Caproni has giant dreams.

175
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:56,620
Stop the camera!

176
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:05,910
The wind's shifting.

177
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:07,280
It's coming this way.

178
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:12,730
Is the wind still rising,

179
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:14,260
Japanese boy?

180
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:17,180
Yes, it's a gale.

181
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,180
Then you must live.

182
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,390
"Le vent se lève."

183
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:23,960
"Il faut tenter de vivre."

184
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,960
Hey, Jiro. Ready?

185
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:31,130
All the new buildings
are old-fashioned.

186
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:33,540
The streets are wider.

187
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,760
Even the airplanes
haven't changed.

188
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:39,370
Welcome!

189
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:46,100
Mackerel again?

190
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,650
It's great.

191
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:49,140
Every day's the same.

192
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,650
Same lunch, same lectures.

193
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:52,040
Can I get an egg?

194
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:52,690
Sure!

195
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:56,050
The Western powers are
building all-metal aircraft.

196
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:58,700
Try the pork sometime.

197
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,700
We're more than
ten years behind.

198
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:04,320
What?

199
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,620
Beautiful, isn't it?

200
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,630
Look at that wonderful curve.

201
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:11,610
You eat mackerel
to look at the bones?

202
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:13,880
Come on, finish up.

203
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,630
We're going for coffee.

204
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,600
Jiro sure is working hard.

205
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,250
Fish bones.

206
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,140
Is Mr. Horikoshi
back from lunch?

207
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,150
Jiro!

208
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,840
Honjo, listen to this.

209
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:42,110
The NACA has a standard
curve just like this bone.

210
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,870
Do Americans
eat mackerel too?

211
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:46,160
Jiro, package for you.

212
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:51,000
A lady brought this for you, sir.

213
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,460
You were out,
so she left it with me.

214
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,940
I see. Thank you.

215
00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:00,290
Present from your sweetheart?

216
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:01,960
Got a smoke?

217
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,120
Gimme one.

218
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,570
Jiro!

219
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:21,570
Let him go.

220
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,520
Hello, Mr. Horikoshi.

221
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,590
Back from school.

222
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:51,090
Your guest is waiting.

223
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:52,770
A young lady.

224
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:54,500
Oh, right.

225
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:05,580
Honestly, where were you?

226
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,080
Kayo, I'm sorry.

227
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:10,460
I completely forgot.

228
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,050
Really!

229
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:12,930
Where's Mother?

230
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:14,580
At Uncle's.

231
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,930
Is she staying there?

232
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:17,070
Just for one night.

233
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:20,460
You've grown, Kayo.

234
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,840
And gotten very pretty, too.

235
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,190
You're so mean.

236
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:26,350
You never ever come home.

237
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:32,810
Oh, it's almost sunset already.

238
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:35,680
I'll tell them I kept you.

239
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,210
Let's take the
penny steamer.

240
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:42,100
She must really like you.

241
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,700
Come on,
it's been two years.

242
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:47,660
Didn't you try to
see her again?

243
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:50,290
Of course.
I went back once.

244
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,160
The fire stopped
at her street.

245
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,330
I see...

246
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:06,680
Look, there's the dock.

247
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,190
Are you cold?

248
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:22,460
I'm fine.

249
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:25,320
I never dreamed
Tokyo would recover so quickly.

250
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,270
Can I stay with you, Jiro?

251
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:35,830
Father won't let me
live here by myself.

252
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:39,830
I'll probably be in Nagoya
by the time you come.

253
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:41,070
With an airplane company?

254
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:41,840
Yes.

255
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:44,110
Men have it so good.

256
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:47,590
I want to study medicine in Tokyo.

257
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,470
A doctor?

258
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:51,100
I think you might be
a good one.

259
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:53,100
I think so, too!

260
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:56,140
I'll talk to Father
next time I'm home.

261
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,280
Thanks.

262
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,600
I'm counting on you.

263
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:05,760
Jiro!

264
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,640
There you are.

265
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,350
You made it.

266
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:11,250
Finally.

267
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:12,110
We're on our way.

268
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:13,740
Yes, we are.

269
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,490
They must've been
heading for the city.

270
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:37,160
There were hundreds of them.

271
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,210
There's no work
in the countryside.

272
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:44,960
Another bank failure.

273
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,940
Which one is it this time?

274
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,660
Are those the customers?

275
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:54,850
Looks like it.

276
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:56,750
There were rumors.

277
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:59,680
The economy's in the tank.

278
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,020
So is our new employer.

279
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:18,910
Mitsubishi Internal
Combustion Engine Co.

280
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,380
We've been waiting for you.

281
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:24,580
What took you so long?

282
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:27,550
I was told to come
anytime in April.

283
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:29,970
Then you should've
come in March!

284
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:32,990
I've got an assignment for you.

285
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,030
It's the design for
the wing strut fitting.

286
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,980
I need it right away.

287
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,530
We're behind
schedule already.

288
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:46,810
In here.

289
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:50,720
The data's ready.

290
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,630
This way.

291
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,410
This is your desk.

292
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:04,580
It's imported,
but no one likes it.

293
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,760
Data here, hat goes there.

294
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:08,750
Listen up!

295
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:10,800
The Falcon Project
has a new engineer.

296
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,800
He's the genius we've all
been hearing about.

297
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:16,270
Introduce yourself.

298
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:18,370
Jiro Horikoshi. I look forward to
working with you all.

299
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:19,690
Now get to work.

300
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:59,380
Jiro, come on.

301
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:02,260
It's lunchtime. Let's go.

302
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:05,730
The assembly plant?

303
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:08,040
Yes, I'd like to take a look.

304
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:13,950
Asking a green engineer to design
that fitting is practically hazing.

305
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:15,170
Two.

306
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:16,960
Excuse me.

307
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,170
Could we ask a favor?

308
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:21,800
Look, it's really coming along.

309
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:25,050
Sorry to bother you on your break.

310
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:29,020
Not at all. You young engineers
should visit us more often.

311
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,610
Honjo, the strut's already installed.

312
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:34,230
I knew it.

313
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:36,300
Kurokawa's just hazing you.

314
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,240
Is his fitting
better than yours?

315
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,860
Mr. Kurokawa's always hard
on new employees.

316
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:44,550
Honjo, get up here
and take a look.

317
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:46,310
I need your opinion.

318
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:53,060
What do you think?

319
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,750
Looks strong enough.

320
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:56,190
This is no good.

321
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:58,090
It's just like my design.

322
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:00,010
Then it must be bad.

323
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:02,340
Foreman, lunch break's over.

324
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,840
Quiet.

325
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,650
Fascinating!

326
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:07,340
Aircraft are fascinating!

327
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:09,350
Maybe they are,
but we're late.

328
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:19,820
I'm Hattori.

329
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,200
Mr. Hattori is our chief engineer.

330
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,040
Is this his first assignment?

331
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,540
The strut fitting
for the Falcon.

332
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,730
That's no fitting.

333
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,820
Explain yourself, young man.

334
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:37,840
Yes sir. This leaf spring
will absorb stress from the wing.

335
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:41,050
The wire expands
and contracts automatically.

336
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:45,340
It runs through the strut
to an anchor on the fuselage.

337
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,100
But we'd have to
redesign the wing!

338
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,380
You're right.

339
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,100
I haven't done
the calculations yet.

340
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,790
You're wasting time!

341
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:56,360
Where's the assignment
I gave you?!

342
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,590
It's finished.

343
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:06,090
That looks like
a very clean design to me.

344
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,700
It's perfect.

345
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:11,690
Submit your work
as soon as you finish!

346
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:17,040
Hey, I'm heading out.

347
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,250
Me too.

348
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:19,450
You sure?

349
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:21,090
What about Kurokawa's homework?

350
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:22,280
Just finishing up.

351
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,600
Oxen.

352
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,890
They haul prototypes
to the airfield.

353
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:33,690
The latest aircraft,
hauled by oxen.

354
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:35,600
That's how backward we are.

355
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,400
But they're wonderful creatures.

356
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:43,900
Here she comes.

357
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,030
Get ready!

358
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,720
Approaching the mark.

359
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:00,310
Damn it!

360
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:10,800
Did you get it?

361
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,700
13.3 seconds. 145 knots.

362
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:14,450
Too slow.

363
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:16,370
We need ten more knots.

364
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:17,660
She's too low.

365
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,560
The engine's not performing.

366
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:22,560
Kurokawa!

367
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:25,320
Representatives from the Army.

368
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:27,220
An audacious design.

369
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:30,180
Your Falcon is quite impressive.

370
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:31,070
Another coup for Mitsubishi.

371
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,250
A power dive.

372
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:52,070
He's trying to break 200.

373
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:16,890
His parachute's open.

374
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:18,060
Go get him!

375
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:38,430
Mr. Kurokawa, we'll investigate
the cause when the weather clears.

376
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:39,670
What about the pilot?

377
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:40,460
He's okay.

378
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:41,640
That's good.

379
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,540
Mr. Kurokawa, let's go.

380
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:46,250
We'll build Falcon Two.

381
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:50,380
Do you think the
strut fitting failed?

382
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:56,070
No. I think the problem is
deeper and more complicated.

383
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:58,660
I'll never forget
what I saw today.

384
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,390
It's like an endless road is
opening up before my eyes.

385
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:05,960
There won't be a Falcon Two.

386
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:09,400
The Army has decided to
go with a competing design.

387
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:14,410
Today was our last chance
to change their minds.

388
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:19,420
We're going to build a bomber
with help from Junkers.

389
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:21,350
No more fighters for now.

390
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,720
This is your chance
to see Germany.

391
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,360
I've already approved it.

392
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,030
Still open?

393
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:05,460
Ah, welcome back.

394
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:08,190
You're later than usual.

395
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:09,820
Two slices of the usual.

396
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:10,900
Coming up.

397
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,520
There you are.

398
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,520
No one's
looking after them?

399
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:24,840
Their parents work late.

400
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:27,210
They wait there every night.

401
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:29,900
I feel bad closing the place up.

402
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,730
I see. Well, thanks.

403
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:33,230
Come again.

404
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:42,420
You must be hungry.

405
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:43,620
Here's something to eat.

406
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,620
It's sponge cake.
I just bought it.

407
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,620
Here, have some.

408
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,550
Come on!

409
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:20,020
You here, Jiro?

410
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:24,450
Too bad about the Falcon.

411
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:25,970
I heard they axed it.

412
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:29,520
Sponge cake?

413
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,000
You have some
strange eating habits.

414
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,330
What did you expect?

415
00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:47,770
Did you think she was going to
smile and say thank you?

416
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:49,330
Of course not.

417
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:51,570
Well...

418
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:53,000
maybe I did.

419
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:58,670
There are dozens of hungry kids
right here in this neighborhood.

420
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:04,910
The cost of one fitting would feed
that kid's family for a month.

421
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:08,410
Why is Japan so poor?

422
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:13,840
Jiro, do you know what we're paying
the Germans for their technology?

423
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:18,760
Enough to feed every kid in Japan,
with sponge cake for dessert.

424
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:22,890
Still, I plan to make the most
of this opportunity.

425
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:24,890
They're sending you too?

426
00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:26,290
They told me today.

427
00:44:26,290 --> 00:44:28,040
Really? That's great news.

428
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:31,340
Poor countries want airplanes.

429
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:34,710
So they pay us a lot
to design them. It's ironic.

430
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,920
I'm leaving for Tokyo tomorrow.

431
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,510
Getting married.

432
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:40,820
Married?

433
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:45,220
To work hard at the office,
you need a family at home. More irony.

434
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:47,020
Good night.

435
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:24,160
Tight-fisted Germans.

436
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:27,780
They're hardly
showing us anything.

437
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,890
I don't see any oxen.

438
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:32,080
The airstrip's
next to the plant.

439
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:34,290
Everything's so big.

440
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:59,480
It's the G-38.
Is this what we're buying?

441
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:01,420
For conversion to a bomber.

442
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:02,510
It's top secret.

443
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:06,280
Who's the Army planning
to bomb with this thing?

444
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,800
America, probably.
Not that they could.

445
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:13,770
Still, it's quite something.

446
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:14,870
Amazing.

447
00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:19,380
Passengers can sit in the wings.
This would be wasted as a bomber.

448
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:24,510
Who cares? We need their
all-metal airframe technology.

449
00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:31,160
You're kidding.
We can't go inside?

450
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:01,190
Beautiful.

451
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:04,760
Japanese!

452
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:07,700
Don't come closer.
You belong over there. Step back!

453
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:10,260
Stop it.
Take your hands off him.

454
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:13,010
Is this how Germans
treat their guests?

455
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:15,150
You Japanese copy everything.

456
00:47:15,150 --> 00:47:17,350
This technology
belongs to Germany.

457
00:47:17,350 --> 00:47:18,800
Oh, come on.

458
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,190
Japan has lots of
planes like this.

459
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:22,650
Honjo, let it go.

460
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:27,050
We have a license
to your technology.

461
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:30,110
We signed an agreement.

462
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:32,580
We have the right to be here.

463
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:37,540
Your bosses never said
we couldn't inspect this airplane.

464
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:41,380
I'm sure you're only
trying to do your job.

465
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:42,530
However,

466
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:44,310
we will not
tolerate this treatment.

467
00:47:44,310 --> 00:47:46,800
The agreement is between equals.

468
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:51,090
Our orders were not to
let you Japanese wander around.

469
00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:52,800
A moment, please.

470
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:11,070
That's Dr. Junkers.

471
00:48:11,070 --> 00:48:12,930
What an engineer.

472
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,080
You can go inside.

473
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:18,370
Dr. Junkers has agreed.

474
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,710
I'm surprised we got
a demonstration.

475
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:35,890
There's more vibration
than I expected.

476
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:38,890
Our bosses are getting giddy.

477
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:42,290
Let the Army officers sit here.

478
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:48,630
Just a moment.

479
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:51,300
This is truly a stupendous aircraft.

480
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,640
Look, a corridor through the wing.

481
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:59,140
This is amazing.

482
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:03,130
It's like being inside
a power plant.

483
00:49:04,370 --> 00:49:05,290
Who's there?

484
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:07,650
This area is off-limits.

485
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:08,800
Guten tag.

486
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,470
Dr. Junkers gave us permission.

487
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:13,760
Please show us your work station.

488
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,640
This is the flight
engineer's station.

489
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,850
This aircraft is marvelous.

490
00:49:17,850 --> 00:49:19,220
This is our pride!

491
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:22,770
Japanese, do not go further.

492
00:49:22,770 --> 00:49:24,230
It is too dangerous.

493
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:26,320
Of course, my friend.

494
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:27,860
This is incredible.

495
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:29,730
Yes, it's fantastic.

496
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:32,840
A triumph of German
industrial technology.

497
00:50:04,370 --> 00:50:06,200
Dr. Junkers is my hero,

498
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:08,380
but his company is sneaky.

499
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:12,230
Got a cigarette, Jiro?

500
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:14,720
Jiro!

501
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:18,310
A cigarette.

502
00:50:18,310 --> 00:50:19,420
No.

503
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:20,390
We're out.

504
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:40,410
It looks cold outside,
but this room is cozy.

505
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,140
I thought Germans used fireplaces.

506
00:50:45,010 --> 00:50:46,750
Junkers makes radiators too.

507
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:49,230
This almost looks like that plane.

508
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:50,570
It's beautiful.

509
00:50:50,570 --> 00:50:54,760
And our technology is primitive.
That's what you mean, right?

510
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:57,710
You think we'll
never figure out

511
00:50:57,710 --> 00:51:00,260
all-metal construction
on our own?

512
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:04,860
We can't learn
anything from this.

513
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:07,940
These are just
pretty equations.

514
00:51:08,890 --> 00:51:11,630
"This technology
belongs to Germany."

515
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:15,870
Maybe we don't even
need their technology.

516
00:51:15,870 --> 00:51:18,590
Wood and canvas
could be just as good as metal.

517
00:51:18,590 --> 00:51:20,600
Then we'll never make it.

518
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,950
We're already
twenty years behind.

519
00:51:28,270 --> 00:51:29,290
Let's take a walk.

520
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:32,620
My brain is boiling.

521
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:44,930
We're Achilles, chasing a tortoise
with a twenty-year lead.

522
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:50,370
If we close the gap
in five years,

523
00:51:50,370 --> 00:51:53,170
he'll be five more years
down the road.

524
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:56,380
We'll always be chasing him.

525
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:58,750
It's only a matter
of time before

526
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:01,260
we overtake him
and move ahead.

527
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:05,120
I wonder if we can
be the tortoise.

528
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:12,960
What?

529
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,230
Listen to that.

530
00:52:23,430 --> 00:52:25,210
Schubert's "Winter Journey".

531
00:52:25,210 --> 00:52:27,140
It's perfect for us.

532
00:52:36,310 --> 00:52:37,540
It's the Japanese.

533
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:38,880
Over there!

534
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:44,050
Go back to where you belong!

535
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:51,430
What was that about?

536
00:52:51,430 --> 00:52:53,830
We saw him in the hangar.

537
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:54,390
Jiro?

538
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,160
Hey, I'm done.

539
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:58,710
Go bathe.

540
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:04,420
Dead to the world...

541
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:09,080
with a face like he's carrying
the future of Japanese aviation.

542
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:14,840
There's a telegram
from headquarters.

543
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:15,630
Come in.

544
00:54:15,630 --> 00:54:16,600
Not necessary.

545
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:19,110
Some of us are
returning immediately.

546
00:54:19,110 --> 00:54:20,730
You're staying behind.

547
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:24,440
Jiro will continue west
and return to Japan.

548
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:25,350
West?

549
00:54:25,350 --> 00:54:27,370
They want him to
see the world.

550
00:54:27,370 --> 00:54:28,930
All by himself?

551
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:56,890
Mr. Caproni.

552
00:54:56,890 --> 00:54:59,060
Is the wind still rising?

553
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,690
Yes, it is.

554
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:05,440
Then I invite you to
join me on my final flight.

555
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:06,440
Come.

556
00:55:06,730 --> 00:55:08,070
You're retiring?

557
00:55:10,090 --> 00:55:11,800
It's a big jump.

558
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:17,580
Jump!

559
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:29,430
Hurry. We're taking off.

560
00:55:29,950 --> 00:55:33,430
There's a hatch under the fuselage.

561
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:34,840
Hurry!

562
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:35,430
On my way!

563
00:55:35,430 --> 00:55:36,850
Let me through.

564
00:55:36,850 --> 00:55:38,000
Up here!

565
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:47,400
Full speed ahead!

566
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,010
Fly! Fly!

567
00:55:56,310 --> 00:55:59,380
My workmen's
families and relatives.

568
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:01,080
Practically the whole village.

569
00:56:01,810 --> 00:56:03,790
We're taking a private jaunt

570
00:56:03,790 --> 00:56:07,530
before we deliver this bomber
to the Air Force.

571
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:14,650
What do you think?

572
00:56:14,650 --> 00:56:16,040
It's incredible.

573
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:19,950
It's like a building
out of ancient Rome.

574
00:56:19,950 --> 00:56:23,310
This plane is too large
to be used for war,

575
00:56:23,310 --> 00:56:25,730
but the Air Force
likes everything big.

576
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,320
Japan is poor and backward.

577
00:56:29,110 --> 00:56:32,740
We could never build
something like this.

578
00:56:33,130 --> 00:56:35,870
The important thing
for an engineer is inspiration.

579
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:38,180
Inspiration unlocks the future.

580
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:40,620
Technology will catch up.

581
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:45,060
My wife and family.

582
00:56:45,690 --> 00:56:48,110
We Italians are also poor.

583
00:56:48,110 --> 00:56:50,090
Too many mouths to feed.

584
00:56:55,530 --> 00:56:57,710
Hey, settle down.

585
00:56:57,710 --> 00:56:59,410
The bottom will fall out.

586
00:57:00,370 --> 00:57:01,410
Come.

587
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:07,070
Watch your step.

588
00:57:07,070 --> 00:57:10,260
This may be a dream,
but you can still lose your head.

589
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:24,710
Which would you choose, a world
with pyramids or one without them?

590
00:57:24,710 --> 00:57:26,170
Pyramids?

591
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:31,220
Humanity dreams of flight,
but the dream is cursed.

592
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:36,050
Aircraft are destined to become
tools for slaughter and destruction.

593
00:57:36,050 --> 00:57:37,180
I know.

594
00:57:37,490 --> 00:57:41,620
But still, I chose a world
with pyramids in it.

595
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:44,970
Which world will you choose?

596
00:57:44,970 --> 00:57:48,230
I want to create beautiful airplanes.

597
00:57:48,230 --> 00:57:49,630
Like that one?

598
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:07,420
Very graceful.

599
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:09,290
I have a long way to go.

600
00:58:09,290 --> 00:58:11,800
I don't even have the engine yet.

601
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:22,320
Bravo!

602
00:58:22,990 --> 00:58:25,160
A beautiful dream.

603
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:36,420
I'm retiring.
This is my last design.

604
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:39,920
Artists are creative
only for ten years.

605
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:42,680
We engineers are no different.

606
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:48,020
Live your ten years
to the fullest.

607
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:06,810
Jiro, we need to talk.

608
00:59:06,810 --> 00:59:07,960
I've got a meeting.

609
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:09,060
Cancel it.

610
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,240
This is a tall order.

611
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:28,830
They're always tall.

612
00:59:28,830 --> 00:59:31,400
How long have you
been with us, Jiro?

613
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:34,160
Jiro?

614
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:35,530
How long?

615
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:36,420
Five years.

616
00:59:36,950 --> 00:59:38,180
You should be ready, then.

617
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:40,340
We want you to
lead the project.

618
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:42,420
It's the Navy's design
competition for 1932.

619
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:44,170
A carrier-based fighter.

620
00:59:44,170 --> 00:59:45,430
A plum assignment.

621
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:49,940
Well, Jiro?

622
01:00:01,550 --> 01:00:03,170
What do you think?

623
01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:04,450
Leave it to me.

624
01:00:04,870 --> 01:00:06,180
Good.

625
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:08,360
I'd like Honjo on the team.

626
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:09,460
Bad idea.

627
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:11,550
You'd end up competing.

628
01:00:11,550 --> 01:00:13,270
Friendship's more important.

629
01:00:14,270 --> 01:00:15,770
Relax and
finish your coffee.

630
01:00:16,570 --> 01:00:18,280
Check, please.

631
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:21,450
We've got other plans for Honjo.

632
01:01:08,010 --> 01:01:10,100
Damn these Japanese engines!

633
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:22,990
And damn this
short flight deck.

634
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:29,290
Fresh uniforms!

635
01:01:29,290 --> 01:01:31,230
Oh, thanks.

636
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:44,970
Thanks for your help.

637
01:01:44,970 --> 01:01:46,220
Those jerseys suit you.

638
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:15,420
Close the flight deck!

639
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:09,280
Stop!

640
01:04:11,470 --> 01:04:13,110
We did it!

641
01:04:13,110 --> 01:04:14,780
She's airborne!

642
01:05:19,870 --> 01:05:21,910
Father!

643
01:06:08,090 --> 01:06:10,020
Bravo!

644
01:06:10,020 --> 01:06:11,360
Nice catch.

645
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:17,350
That was kind of you.

646
01:06:17,350 --> 01:06:18,240
Are you all right?

647
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:20,190
I'm fine. Here you are.

648
01:06:20,190 --> 01:06:21,540
Thank you.

649
01:06:21,540 --> 01:06:23,080
It belongs to the hotel.

650
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:24,480
Well, goodbye.

651
01:06:37,780 --> 01:06:41,250
Father, I'm afraid
I was rude to that man.

652
01:06:41,250 --> 01:06:43,590
Don't worry.
He's staying at our hotel.

653
01:06:43,590 --> 01:06:46,540
You'll have a chance
to say thank you.

654
01:09:31,450 --> 01:09:33,090
What is it?

655
01:09:33,090 --> 01:09:34,190
Nothing.

656
01:09:34,190 --> 01:09:36,940
Just that man
who caught the parasol.

657
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:39,980
He seems to be here by himself.

658
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:53,290
I'm sorry. I'd better go.

659
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:56,780
No, please stay.

660
01:10:56,780 --> 01:10:59,060
I was giving thanks
to the spring.

661
01:10:59,750 --> 01:11:03,400
I asked it to
bring you here, to me.

662
01:11:06,930 --> 01:11:10,080
You haven't changed at all.

663
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:11,700
You're just like
you were then.

664
01:11:12,430 --> 01:11:16,240
We were so grateful for
your help after the earthquake.

665
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:19,420
I wanted to see you again
and thank you.

666
01:11:19,420 --> 01:11:21,480
Oh, now I remember.

667
01:11:22,110 --> 01:11:24,480
My name is Nahoko Satomi.

668
01:11:25,610 --> 01:11:27,320
Jiro Horikoshi.

669
01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:50,720
Are you all right?

670
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:52,350
I'm fine.

671
01:11:53,970 --> 01:11:59,040
Kinu got married two days after
she dropped off your shirt.

672
01:11:59,980 --> 01:12:02,460
She cried for joy
when we found you.

673
01:12:02,990 --> 01:12:06,270
You were our knight
in shining armor.

674
01:12:06,270 --> 01:12:07,300
Your knight?

675
01:12:07,300 --> 01:12:10,800
You were like a knight
on a white horse that day.

676
01:12:11,490 --> 01:12:13,550
This umbrella sure does leak.

677
01:12:14,220 --> 01:12:15,310
It's all right.

678
01:12:15,310 --> 01:12:17,620
I've got to tell Kinu.

679
01:12:17,620 --> 01:12:20,620
She just had her second child.

680
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:22,810
It's such a cute baby.

681
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:28,740
Your painting is all wet.

682
01:12:28,740 --> 01:12:31,820
Yes. I'll keep it this way
in honor of today.

683
01:12:31,820 --> 01:12:34,160
Look, it's clearing up.

684
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:42,730
The rain stopped here.

685
01:12:44,740 --> 01:12:46,570
Oh, look at that.

686
01:12:54,910 --> 01:12:57,340
I'd almost forgotten
what rainbows look like.

687
01:12:57,340 --> 01:12:59,580
Life is wonderful, isn't it?

688
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:02,110
We'd better go.

689
01:13:02,110 --> 01:13:04,250
Father's probably worried sick.

690
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:10,020
There's my father.

691
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:12,590
Father!

692
01:13:13,370 --> 01:13:16,100
Come, I'll introduce you.

693
01:13:18,890 --> 01:13:20,370
You're soaking wet.

694
01:13:20,370 --> 01:13:25,540
Don't worry, Father. I'm fine.
Mr. Horikoshi saved me again.

695
01:13:25,540 --> 01:13:27,050
Jiro Horikoshi.

696
01:13:27,050 --> 01:13:28,720
Satomi.

697
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:31,590
I'm afraid my daughter has
caused you trouble again.

698
01:14:16,950 --> 01:14:18,830
May I sit here?

699
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:21,830
Certainly.

700
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:40,560
German tobacco.

701
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,950
Last one. Too bad.

702
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:44,920
I know how you feel.

703
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:48,670
The same thing happened to me.

704
01:14:48,670 --> 01:14:51,310
You visit Germany, yes?

705
01:14:51,310 --> 01:14:52,960
To Dessau.

706
01:14:54,130 --> 01:14:56,470
You must be Sherlock Holmes.

707
01:14:56,470 --> 01:14:59,130
You are an engineer.

708
01:14:59,130 --> 01:15:02,090
You read German magazines.

709
01:15:02,090 --> 01:15:03,460
Magazines about airplanes.

710
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:07,230
All Japanese engineers
visit Dessau.

711
01:15:09,890 --> 01:15:11,210
You're exactly right.

712
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:14,900
Dr. Junkers is in trouble.

713
01:15:15,730 --> 01:15:16,490
Trouble?

714
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:21,000
He fights the government.

715
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,240
He will blow up.

716
01:15:22,850 --> 01:15:24,700
Mr. Hitler's government?

717
01:15:25,350 --> 01:15:28,460
The Nazis are
a gang of hoodlums.

718
01:15:28,850 --> 01:15:31,170
This is a good place.

719
01:15:31,170 --> 01:15:32,740
No mosquitoes.

720
01:15:32,740 --> 01:15:34,020
Not hot.

721
01:15:34,020 --> 01:15:35,840
Good watercress.

722
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:38,720
A good place to
forget bad things.

723
01:15:39,250 --> 01:15:41,350
Cigarette?
I'm afraid they're Japanese.

724
01:15:41,350 --> 01:15:42,720
Thank you.

725
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:49,900
It is a nice night.

726
01:15:49,900 --> 01:15:52,360
Hier ist der Zauberberg.

727
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:54,680
"The Magic Mountain"
by Thomas Mann?

728
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:57,240
A good place for forgetting.

729
01:15:57,670 --> 01:16:01,000
Make a war in China. Forget it.

730
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,870
Make a puppet state
in Manchuria. Forget it.

731
01:16:04,390 --> 01:16:07,370
Quit the League of Nations. Forget it.

732
01:16:07,370 --> 01:16:10,120
Make the world your enemy. Forget it.

733
01:16:10,860 --> 01:16:12,770
Japan will blow up.

734
01:16:13,810 --> 01:16:15,880
Germany will blow up too.

735
01:16:16,340 --> 01:16:18,270
Will Germany go to war again?

736
01:16:18,270 --> 01:16:20,450
Yes. They must be stopped.

737
01:16:21,740 --> 01:16:24,680
I'm sorry to keep you
waiting so long.

738
01:16:25,030 --> 01:16:27,550
Nahoko has a fever.

739
01:16:27,550 --> 01:16:30,440
I'm afraid we'll have to
cancel our dinner plans.

740
01:16:30,870 --> 01:16:32,540
I'm sorry.

741
01:16:32,540 --> 01:16:34,440
Please tell her
I hope she feels better.

742
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:37,800
I must go.
The doctor will be here soon.

743
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:36,440
"Who has seen the wind?"

744
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:39,590
"Neither I nor you."

745
01:18:40,210 --> 01:18:44,400
"But when the leaves hang trembling,
the wind is passing through."

746
01:18:50,220 --> 01:18:52,600
Let the wind carry...

747
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:55,830
these wings to you.

748
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:33,370
Jiro?

749
01:19:33,690 --> 01:19:34,790
Nahoko!

750
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:56,660
Be careful!

751
01:21:56,450 --> 01:21:57,720
Nice catch.

752
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:36,470
<I>It only happens once,</I>

753
01:22:36,470 --> 01:22:38,800
<I>it doesn't happen again,</I>

754
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:43,220
<I>it might just be dreaming!</I>

755
01:22:43,470 --> 01:22:48,250
<I>It can only happen once in a lifetime,</I>

756
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:53,250
<I>tomorrow it might already be over!</I>

757
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:58,180
<I>It can only happen once in a lifetime,</I>

758
01:22:59,820 --> 01:23:06,960
<I>since every spring has only one May.</I>

759
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:14,790
Bravo!

760
01:23:14,790 --> 01:23:17,360
Is the young lady feeling better?

761
01:23:17,990 --> 01:23:19,970
Yes, she's much better.

762
01:23:19,970 --> 01:23:21,390
Congratulations.

763
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:23,890
This is the magic mountain.

764
01:23:23,890 --> 01:23:25,230
It cures everyone.

765
01:23:25,830 --> 01:23:27,350
I think you're right.

766
01:23:28,110 --> 01:23:32,470
At first, this young man
was very gloomy.

767
01:23:32,470 --> 01:23:34,360
Now he is very happy.

768
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:36,610
He has fallen in love.

769
01:23:37,510 --> 01:23:38,550
That's true.

770
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:42,660
Summer love is soon forgotten.

771
01:23:42,660 --> 01:23:44,600
You will go
down the mountain.

772
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:46,370
You will forget
what happened here.

773
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:48,620
Not me.

774
01:23:49,350 --> 01:23:51,480
This person you're
talking about...

775
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:53,500
isn't my daughter, is it?

776
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:55,740
Yes, it's Nahoko.

777
01:23:57,660 --> 01:24:00,130
Please give us your permission.

778
01:24:01,700 --> 01:24:02,850
But...

779
01:24:02,850 --> 01:24:04,080
Father!

780
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:08,140
I would like to accept.

781
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:10,600
What a beauty.

782
01:24:13,710 --> 01:24:17,200
But first, there's something
I have to tell you.

783
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:17,860
Yes?

784
01:24:18,380 --> 01:24:22,090
Two years ago,
my mother died of tuberculosis.

785
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:25,120
I contracted it too.

786
01:24:25,720 --> 01:24:29,870
I've loved you since
that day you rescued my hat.

787
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:34,500
I've loved you since the wind
brought you to me.

788
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:36,880
Please marry me.

789
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:38,010
I will.

790
01:24:38,010 --> 01:24:40,450
But I want to get well first.

791
01:24:40,450 --> 01:24:42,220
Can you wait for me?

792
01:24:42,220 --> 01:24:43,260
Of course.

793
01:24:43,630 --> 01:24:45,510
Even if it takes
a hundred years.

794
01:24:46,060 --> 01:24:47,390
Congratulations.

795
01:24:47,390 --> 01:24:49,500
He is a nice young man.

796
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:52,020
Your daughter is wonderful.

797
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:56,020
This is a good summer.

798
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:20,430
Jiro, over here!

799
01:25:20,430 --> 01:25:21,430
Honjo!

800
01:25:21,430 --> 01:25:22,330
When'd you get back?

801
01:25:22,330 --> 01:25:23,760
Two days ago.

802
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:25,320
Hot, isn't it?

803
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:29,770
Come take a look.

804
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:36,400
She's beautiful.

805
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:38,340
Good clean lines.

806
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:44,010
It's a radical design.

807
01:25:44,510 --> 01:25:45,850
They gave me free rein.

808
01:25:46,970 --> 01:25:49,180
But we won't know
until she flies.

809
01:25:49,810 --> 01:25:52,190
She'll fly all right.

810
01:25:52,190 --> 01:25:53,290
I feel the wind rising.

811
01:26:14,160 --> 01:26:16,260
You're the Japanese Achilles.

812
01:26:16,260 --> 01:26:18,210
You've closed the gap.

813
01:26:19,170 --> 01:26:21,150
My plane was just
a tin duckling.

814
01:26:21,150 --> 01:26:22,880
I have an idea for you.

815
01:26:23,650 --> 01:26:25,550
I haven't tried it yet.

816
01:26:28,180 --> 01:26:31,000
Use flathead screws
on the access hatches.

817
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,830
They'll reduce drag.

818
01:26:32,830 --> 01:26:37,790
Maintenance will be easy
with a hinge on one side.

819
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:45,510
A spring about this stiff
should be fine.

820
01:26:45,510 --> 01:26:47,560
Jiro, that's a great idea.

821
01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:49,510
It's just like
Columbus' egg.

822
01:26:49,510 --> 01:26:50,600
You should use it.

823
01:26:51,510 --> 01:26:53,270
Thanks, but not this time.

824
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:56,850
I'll keep the plans.

825
01:26:56,850 --> 01:27:00,110
After you use it,
I'll use it too.

826
01:27:01,210 --> 01:27:02,360
Okay.

827
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:04,860
Hurry up, I'll be waiting.

828
01:27:05,550 --> 01:27:07,950
Jiro! Are you here?

829
01:27:08,390 --> 01:27:11,030
Jiro, it's Mr. Kurokawa.

830
01:27:11,030 --> 01:27:12,360
It's an emergency.

831
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:13,690
See you.

832
01:27:13,690 --> 01:27:14,900
Visit the house next time.

833
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:17,270
Jiro, you pedal.

834
01:27:22,570 --> 01:27:24,460
The Special Police
are looking for you.

835
01:27:25,740 --> 01:27:28,430
The thought crime boys.

836
01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:30,220
Why me?

837
01:27:30,220 --> 01:27:32,010
I told them you were
away on business.

838
01:27:43,750 --> 01:27:45,420
Pretending to leave?

839
01:27:45,420 --> 01:27:46,890
We won't fall for that.

840
01:27:46,890 --> 01:27:48,210
You'd better work here.

841
01:27:48,210 --> 01:27:49,570
We'll bring your things.

842
01:27:49,570 --> 01:27:51,060
What's going on?

843
01:27:51,060 --> 01:27:52,490
Why are they after me?

844
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:55,950
They arrested some of my friends.

845
01:27:55,950 --> 01:27:57,980
None of them understood why.

846
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:00,580
Come in.

847
01:28:00,580 --> 01:28:01,980
Here's your stuff.

848
01:28:04,110 --> 01:28:06,080
Sorry for the bother.

849
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:07,510
Need anything else?

850
01:28:07,970 --> 01:28:09,260
Just leave it and go.

851
01:28:09,260 --> 01:28:10,380
Jiro, it's here!

852
01:28:10,380 --> 01:28:12,490
The prototype flange.

853
01:28:22,790 --> 01:28:24,440
It looks great.

854
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:26,600
Wish we'd had it last year.

855
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:28,110
Jiro, what do you think?

856
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:32,620
Our next plane will be
a full-grown duck, not a duckling.

857
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:35,950
A full metal duck.

858
01:28:35,950 --> 01:28:37,620
How about it, Mr. Kurokawa?

859
01:28:38,140 --> 01:28:42,290
Extruded aluminum alloy.
Very light. What a luxury.

860
01:28:42,290 --> 01:28:44,000
All right, back to work.

861
01:28:55,870 --> 01:28:57,230
The coast looks clear.

862
01:28:57,230 --> 01:28:58,540
Okay, Jiro.

863
01:29:00,370 --> 01:29:03,150
Better lie low
for a few days.

864
01:29:03,150 --> 01:29:05,360
We'll smooth things over.

865
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:07,190
I'll put you up.

866
01:29:07,190 --> 01:29:09,060
Let me stop by
my apartment.

867
01:29:09,060 --> 01:29:10,150
I'm expecting a letter.

868
01:29:11,050 --> 01:29:12,660
Is it something sensitive?

869
01:29:12,660 --> 01:29:14,510
Yes, very sensitive.

870
01:29:14,510 --> 01:29:16,850
The police will be
opening your mail.

871
01:29:16,850 --> 01:29:18,160
It's from my fiancée.

872
01:29:18,530 --> 01:29:21,890
Such things shouldn't happen
in a modern country.

873
01:29:23,730 --> 01:29:25,790
You're engaged?

874
01:29:26,230 --> 01:29:27,920
Jiro's human, after all.

875
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:28,550
Splendid.

876
01:29:28,550 --> 01:29:30,880
You think Japan's
a modern country?

877
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:32,300
It's not funny.

878
01:29:32,300 --> 01:29:33,750
Of course it's not funny.

879
01:29:33,750 --> 01:29:36,060
The police are waiting for you.

880
01:29:36,060 --> 01:29:38,310
Let them read
your love letters.

881
01:29:38,690 --> 01:29:41,890
The Navy's next design
competition is in your hands.

882
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:44,460
The company will protect you.

883
01:29:44,460 --> 01:29:46,920
That is, as long as you're useful.

884
01:29:47,590 --> 01:29:49,420
Just keep your mind on work.

885
01:29:49,900 --> 01:29:54,240
I miss you terribly.
And Mr. Castorp" left so suddenly.

886
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:57,600
Why are they looking for him?

887
01:30:09,940 --> 01:30:15,050
I pray that he managed to
leave Japan safely.

888
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:34,130
Jiro, telephone for you.

889
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:35,800
Coming.

890
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:37,370
The telephone is there.

891
01:30:37,370 --> 01:30:38,640
Thank you.

892
01:30:41,060 --> 01:30:42,130
Hello?

893
01:30:42,130 --> 01:30:44,540
Jiro? You have a telegram.

894
01:30:44,540 --> 01:30:45,710
What?

895
01:30:45,710 --> 01:30:48,560
Your landlord brought it.

896
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:50,150
It came two days ago.

897
01:30:50,650 --> 01:30:52,110
Please read it.

898
01:30:52,110 --> 01:30:52,750
Are you sure?

899
01:30:55,320 --> 01:31:00,050
"Nahoko...has had
a lung...hemorrhage."

900
01:31:00,050 --> 01:31:02,560
"Please come at once. Satomi"

901
01:31:09,670 --> 01:31:11,340
Hello? Are you there?

902
01:31:12,170 --> 01:31:14,320
I understand. Thank you.

903
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:15,840
Wait, hold on!

904
01:31:18,680 --> 01:31:19,680
What is it?

905
01:31:21,180 --> 01:31:23,950
What's the fastest way
to get to Tokyo?

906
01:31:23,950 --> 01:31:25,660
To Tokyo?

907
01:31:25,660 --> 01:31:28,330
I have to be there
as soon as possible.

908
01:31:28,330 --> 01:31:30,320
Let me see.

909
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:34,510
If you take the noon bus,
you can catch the express.

910
01:31:34,510 --> 01:31:37,320
I'll send someone
to hold the bus for you.

911
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:39,340
Jiya!

912
01:33:26,810 --> 01:33:27,950
Darling!

913
01:33:37,980 --> 01:33:39,990
I wish I could've
come sooner.

914
01:33:45,660 --> 01:33:47,450
You'll catch it.

915
01:33:47,450 --> 01:33:48,830
You're beautiful.

916
01:33:49,660 --> 01:33:51,000
I love you.

917
01:33:53,190 --> 01:33:55,170
Jiro? Through the garden?

918
01:34:04,840 --> 01:34:06,180
Come in.

919
01:34:08,010 --> 01:34:11,140
Father, Jiro came to see me.

920
01:34:11,140 --> 01:34:13,520
But he has to
leave right away.

921
01:34:14,020 --> 01:34:16,640
Next time,
I'll use the front door.

922
01:34:16,640 --> 01:34:18,210
Use the garden.
It's more fun.

923
01:34:18,690 --> 01:34:20,210
All right, I will.

924
01:34:20,490 --> 01:34:22,840
Take care, darling.

925
01:34:23,270 --> 01:34:24,200
You too.

926
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:27,350
Goodbye.

927
01:34:27,350 --> 01:34:28,530
I'll see you out.

928
01:34:33,870 --> 01:34:35,500
The last train?

929
01:34:35,500 --> 01:34:36,880
You'd better hurry.

930
01:34:38,750 --> 01:34:40,120
Is it that serious?

931
01:34:40,750 --> 01:34:42,840
I wish I could look after her.

932
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:46,350
The way to do that is
to focus on your work.

933
01:34:46,350 --> 01:34:47,890
Now you'd better go.

934
01:34:55,390 --> 01:34:56,900
He's gone.

935
01:34:57,900 --> 01:34:59,900
Are you crying, dear?

936
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:07,530
I'm going to the sanatorium
the doctor recommended.

937
01:35:07,530 --> 01:35:08,690
But it's so lonely.

938
01:35:08,690 --> 01:35:10,910
You'll be all by yourself.

939
01:35:11,740 --> 01:35:13,670
I want to get better.

940
01:35:13,670 --> 01:35:15,720
I want a life with Jiro.

941
01:35:21,090 --> 01:35:22,820
You're just in time.

942
01:35:22,820 --> 01:35:24,400
The board is waiting.

943
01:35:31,430 --> 01:35:33,200
So, are you ready?

944
01:35:34,100 --> 01:35:35,700
I'll do my best.

945
01:35:35,700 --> 01:35:37,410
Now the Navy.

946
01:35:37,410 --> 01:35:38,710
They're the client.

947
01:35:49,610 --> 01:35:51,220
I'll do my best.

948
01:35:51,220 --> 01:35:53,030
You weren't even listening.

949
01:35:56,460 --> 01:35:58,620
So I gave up on that idea.

950
01:36:00,630 --> 01:36:01,870
Everyone's here rather late.

951
01:36:01,870 --> 01:36:04,800
Jiro's holding a design seminar.

952
01:36:07,090 --> 01:36:10,300
The next design uses
all the latest technology.

953
01:36:10,890 --> 01:36:11,620
Take a look.

954
01:36:12,030 --> 01:36:13,580
Retractable undercarriage!

955
01:36:13,580 --> 01:36:16,120
We'll need it for 270 knots.

956
01:36:16,440 --> 01:36:18,030
270 knots?

957
01:36:18,030 --> 01:36:19,620
That's 500 kilometers an hour!

958
01:36:20,020 --> 01:36:22,380
I thought the Navy
requested 220 knots.

959
01:36:22,980 --> 01:36:25,320
We're designing for the future.

960
01:36:25,980 --> 01:36:28,490
Wing loading is 120 kilos
per square meter.

961
01:36:28,990 --> 01:36:30,880
We'll minimize drag

962
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:33,160
and push the limits of technology.

963
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:36,720
She'll have split flaps
and leading edge slats.

964
01:36:53,280 --> 01:36:55,380
We can do it!

965
01:36:55,380 --> 01:36:57,410
When do we start?

966
01:36:58,180 --> 01:37:00,410
But then weight
becomes a problem.

967
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:06,880
If we leave out the guns,
we should be okay.

968
01:37:12,760 --> 01:37:16,030
I decided to set
this idea aside for now.

969
01:37:17,200 --> 01:37:18,320
This is delightful.

970
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:19,500
Lucid and logical.

971
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:20,770
Almost had it.

972
01:37:21,370 --> 01:37:23,440
Our engines are underpowered.

973
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:26,520
To compensate, we need
a light, strong structure.

974
01:37:26,520 --> 01:37:31,030
We'll cut excess weight
and minimize drag with a smooth skin.

975
01:37:31,030 --> 01:37:32,840
An all-metal fighter

976
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:36,030
like nothing the world's ever seen
that's what we're going to build.

977
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:38,520
I have a question!

978
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:40,060
Mr. Hirayama, please.

979
01:37:41,230 --> 01:37:44,230
Mr. Hirayama is our
production engineer.

980
01:37:44,730 --> 01:37:45,540
Thank you.

981
01:37:47,860 --> 01:37:50,740
He's going to tell us
about the new rivets.

982
01:37:51,530 --> 01:37:57,050
It's technically possible to build
strong structures with flush rivets.

983
01:37:57,050 --> 01:37:58,580
What's he talking about?

984
01:37:59,080 --> 01:38:00,560
A way to cut drag.

985
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:06,230
We're going to skin
the whole aircraft with flush rivets.

986
01:38:06,230 --> 01:38:08,590
Question!

987
01:38:11,090 --> 01:38:13,570
I must say, that was interesting.

988
01:38:13,570 --> 01:38:15,090
It was inspiring.

989
01:38:35,450 --> 01:38:37,740
Today's letter, Miss Satomi.

990
01:38:37,740 --> 01:38:39,450
Thank you.

991
01:39:59,030 --> 01:40:00,830
Phone call, Chief.

992
01:40:00,830 --> 01:40:02,450
I'll call back.

993
01:40:02,450 --> 01:40:03,850
I think it's an emergency.

994
01:40:03,850 --> 01:40:07,210
Hello? Mr. Satomi?

995
01:40:07,870 --> 01:40:09,350
What?!

996
01:41:22,280 --> 01:41:24,580
Jiro! Jiro!

997
01:41:24,580 --> 01:41:25,890
Thank goodness.

998
01:41:25,890 --> 01:41:28,120
I worried I wouldn't find you.

999
01:41:29,910 --> 01:41:31,220
I'm here now.

1000
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:32,620
Can you walk?

1001
01:41:33,790 --> 01:41:34,960
Let's go.

1002
01:41:42,180 --> 01:41:45,450
I just had to see you.
I should go right back.

1003
01:41:45,450 --> 01:41:46,330
Don't go.

1004
01:41:50,140 --> 01:41:51,810
We should be together.

1005
01:42:04,490 --> 01:42:06,060
What a charming companion.

1006
01:42:06,060 --> 01:42:07,310
My name is Nahoko.

1007
01:42:07,310 --> 01:42:08,740
So you're Nahoko.

1008
01:42:08,740 --> 01:42:10,140
Jiro, is that you?

1009
01:42:10,140 --> 01:42:12,310
We've come to you
with a request.

1010
01:42:13,330 --> 01:42:15,480
Why not, dear? It'll be fine.

1011
01:42:15,480 --> 01:42:17,320
We've got plenty of room,

1012
01:42:17,320 --> 01:42:22,690
but I can hardly approve of
an unmarried couple living together.

1013
01:42:23,170 --> 01:42:24,780
We'll get married right away.

1014
01:42:24,780 --> 01:42:26,490
Mr. Kurokawa, Mrs. Kurokawa,

1015
01:42:26,490 --> 01:42:27,780
please be our witnesses.

1016
01:42:27,780 --> 01:42:29,490
Here? Tonight?

1017
01:42:29,490 --> 01:42:31,660
It sounds lovely, dear.

1018
01:42:31,660 --> 01:42:35,040
Nahoko was very brave
to leave the sanatorium.

1019
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:37,320
My father's given his permission.

1020
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:39,820
I've already told the doctor.

1021
01:42:39,820 --> 01:42:41,030
Please help us.

1022
01:42:43,820 --> 01:42:46,700
The bride and I have
preparations to make.

1023
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:48,930
Come with me, Nahoko.

1024
01:42:54,710 --> 01:42:57,560
Don't worry, he's always like that.

1025
01:43:01,380 --> 01:43:03,240
If you care about her,

1026
01:43:03,240 --> 01:43:06,320
you'll send her
back immediately.

1027
01:43:07,180 --> 01:43:11,700
I can't do that.
I'd have to give up my work.

1028
01:43:11,700 --> 01:43:15,210
Is that your heart
or your ego talking?

1029
01:43:16,060 --> 01:43:18,150
We don't have much time.

1030
01:43:18,150 --> 01:43:19,330
We've made our decision.

1031
01:43:20,570 --> 01:43:21,620
I see.

1032
01:43:22,570 --> 01:43:23,600
All right.

1033
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:25,090
We'll have a real ceremony!

1034
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:51,100
Here they come.

1035
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:53,600
She's coming!

1036
01:44:12,950 --> 01:44:14,200
Hear me!

1037
01:44:14,200 --> 01:44:18,420
This lovely maiden has
traveled far to join her beloved.

1038
01:44:18,420 --> 01:44:22,660
She's given up everything
in the world for him.

1039
01:44:22,660 --> 01:44:23,770
What say you?

1040
01:44:24,300 --> 01:44:25,290
Hear me!

1041
01:44:25,290 --> 01:44:27,450
This man is an
insensitive simpleton

1042
01:44:27,450 --> 01:44:29,780
without a home of his own.

1043
01:44:29,780 --> 01:44:33,160
If that's... uh, okay with you,
please come in.

1044
01:44:33,510 --> 01:44:36,810
Then they shall exchange
the marriage vows.

1045
01:44:59,500 --> 01:45:00,830
You look beautiful.

1046
01:45:37,540 --> 01:45:39,540
Mr. and Mrs. Kurokawa.

1047
01:45:40,040 --> 01:45:44,880
No words can express
our gratitude for your kindness.

1048
01:45:45,380 --> 01:45:47,550
We will never forget
our debt to you.

1049
01:45:50,380 --> 01:45:55,680
Come now, we're delighted that
Jiro's found such a wonderful partner.

1050
01:45:55,680 --> 01:45:56,700
Aren't we, dear?

1051
01:45:56,700 --> 01:46:00,870
Of course. This is wonderful.
You're both very courageous.

1052
01:46:16,910 --> 01:46:18,080
You must be tired.

1053
01:46:18,580 --> 01:46:20,930
I feel like I'm dreaming.

1054
01:46:20,930 --> 01:46:23,040
The room is spinning.

1055
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:25,020
Better get some rest.

1056
01:46:26,250 --> 01:46:27,150
Come here.

1057
01:46:27,740 --> 01:46:29,150
But your condition...

1058
01:46:31,090 --> 01:46:32,280
Come.

1059
01:47:14,050 --> 01:47:16,610
Do you always
get home this late?

1060
01:47:16,610 --> 01:47:18,370
Kayo, I completely forgot.

1061
01:47:18,670 --> 01:47:20,600
You're so insensitive.

1062
01:47:22,520 --> 01:47:25,040
Congratulations on becoming a doctor.

1063
01:47:25,040 --> 01:47:28,310
Congratulations on your marriage.

1064
01:47:28,310 --> 01:47:32,040
I came on behalf of the family
to thank the Kurokawas.

1065
01:47:32,040 --> 01:47:33,460
Are they still up?

1066
01:47:33,460 --> 01:47:35,210
They've gone to bed.

1067
01:47:35,210 --> 01:47:36,460
Did you meet Nahoko?

1068
01:47:36,460 --> 01:47:37,280
Yes.

1069
01:47:41,240 --> 01:47:43,760
What are you going to do?

1070
01:47:43,760 --> 01:47:46,390
She's alone in
that room all day.

1071
01:47:46,390 --> 01:47:50,230
Her condition is
much worse than you think.

1072
01:47:50,230 --> 01:47:53,400
I'm an intern.
I know something about this.

1073
01:47:53,750 --> 01:47:58,970
Did you notice she uses rouge
every morning so you won't worry?

1074
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:02,630
I really like Nahoko.

1075
01:48:02,630 --> 01:48:04,150
She's such a good person.

1076
01:48:04,150 --> 01:48:06,290
How can you do this to her?

1077
01:48:10,810 --> 01:48:13,250
Does she really
have to stay here?

1078
01:48:13,250 --> 01:48:14,320
Yes.

1079
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:19,800
Each day is very
precious to us now.

1080
01:48:21,930 --> 01:48:23,230
Get some rest.

1081
01:48:23,230 --> 01:48:25,160
I'm glad you came to visit.

1082
01:48:40,470 --> 01:48:41,780
I'm home.

1083
01:48:41,780 --> 01:48:42,890
I was waiting.

1084
01:48:42,890 --> 01:48:44,010
You should sleep.

1085
01:48:50,310 --> 01:48:51,580
Should you be up?

1086
01:48:51,580 --> 01:48:53,520
Kayo came today.

1087
01:48:54,430 --> 01:48:56,530
We're already best friends.

1088
01:48:57,830 --> 01:49:01,940
She's like the sun,
with such a bright future.

1089
01:49:01,940 --> 01:49:06,040
She said next time,
she'll come as my doctor.

1090
01:49:07,640 --> 01:49:12,620
And your mother made me
a chemise and a nightgown.

1091
01:49:12,620 --> 01:49:14,560
Look, they're so comfy.

1092
01:49:15,670 --> 01:49:16,820
Too bright?

1093
01:49:17,670 --> 01:49:18,820
It's all right.

1094
01:49:21,010 --> 01:49:23,650
I have to finish
the design by tomorrow.

1095
01:49:23,650 --> 01:49:24,890
For your mackerel bones?

1096
01:49:25,690 --> 01:49:26,720
You remembered.

1097
01:49:27,720 --> 01:49:30,390
I think it could
be a little lighter.

1098
01:49:32,690 --> 01:49:34,460
Come a little closer.

1099
01:49:43,860 --> 01:49:45,410
Give me your hand.

1100
01:49:48,810 --> 01:49:52,920
I like to look at you
while you work.

1101
01:49:53,540 --> 01:49:56,290
In a one-handed
slide rule contest,

1102
01:49:56,290 --> 01:49:58,250
I'd win first prize for sure.

1103
01:49:59,380 --> 01:50:02,690
I think I can make each rib
half an ounce lighter.

1104
01:50:02,690 --> 01:50:04,690
Really? That's good.

1105
01:50:04,690 --> 01:50:07,020
Thirty ribs makes about a pound.

1106
01:50:07,020 --> 01:50:08,410
That's too much.

1107
01:50:08,890 --> 01:50:11,410
Half a pound is enough for two.

1108
01:50:11,890 --> 01:50:16,110
I could eat a pound
of mackerel by myself.

1109
01:50:21,900 --> 01:50:24,390
I'll keep holding your hand.
You should sleep.

1110
01:50:24,390 --> 01:50:25,640
You won't let go?

1111
01:50:25,640 --> 01:50:27,620
No, I won't.

1112
01:50:30,080 --> 01:50:31,810
I need a cigarette.

1113
01:50:31,810 --> 01:50:33,720
Can I let go for a minute?

1114
01:50:33,720 --> 01:50:34,900
No.

1115
01:50:34,900 --> 01:50:36,390
Smoke it here.

1116
01:50:36,390 --> 01:50:37,590
It's not good for you.

1117
01:50:37,590 --> 01:50:38,630
I don't care.

1118
01:50:58,110 --> 01:50:59,910
Hey, Honjo.

1119
01:50:59,910 --> 01:51:00,740
Can I take a look?

1120
01:51:00,740 --> 01:51:02,800
Sure. How's your bomber?

1121
01:51:02,800 --> 01:51:04,550
Coming along fine.

1122
01:51:04,940 --> 01:51:06,920
This is avant garde.

1123
01:51:07,480 --> 01:51:08,820
You went all the way.

1124
01:51:12,120 --> 01:51:14,560
So this is flush riveting.

1125
01:51:15,460 --> 01:51:17,170
Feels pretty rough.

1126
01:51:18,430 --> 01:51:20,330
We're still
learning the technique.

1127
01:51:20,330 --> 01:51:22,530
You've left the Germans behind.

1128
01:51:22,530 --> 01:51:25,170
I'm still stuck with them.

1129
01:51:27,720 --> 01:51:30,020
This design is you...

1130
01:51:30,600 --> 01:51:31,990
right down to
the mackerel bones.

1131
01:51:34,310 --> 01:51:37,330
Jiro, let me use flush rivets too.

1132
01:51:37,330 --> 01:51:39,630
And your spring-loaded hatches.

1133
01:51:39,630 --> 01:51:41,500
Sure. Why not?

1134
01:51:41,770 --> 01:51:42,800
A redesign?

1135
01:51:42,800 --> 01:51:47,260
Yeah, but they're only letting me
modify the fuselage.

1136
01:51:47,260 --> 01:51:49,130
And leave the wings alone?

1137
01:51:49,130 --> 01:51:50,840
That's where
the fuel tanks are.

1138
01:51:50,840 --> 01:51:52,260
One hit, and boom.

1139
01:51:52,830 --> 01:51:56,640
To save weight, we aren't even
shielding the fuel tanks.

1140
01:51:56,640 --> 01:52:00,650
It's Japan's first advanced bomber.
The Navy's over the moon.

1141
01:52:02,670 --> 01:52:06,960
She's got to fly 3,000 kilometers
with a big payload.

1142
01:52:06,960 --> 01:52:09,550
More horsepower alone
won't be enough.

1143
01:52:22,770 --> 01:52:24,670
Who are they going to fight?

1144
01:52:24,670 --> 01:52:28,840
China. Russia. Britain.
The Netherlands. America.

1145
01:52:28,840 --> 01:52:30,590
Japan will blow up.

1146
01:52:31,200 --> 01:52:33,360
We're not arms merchants.

1147
01:52:33,360 --> 01:52:35,180
We just want to
build good aircraft.

1148
01:52:35,180 --> 01:52:36,180
You're right.

1149
01:52:36,180 --> 01:52:38,310
See you. Get some sleep.

1150
01:52:38,310 --> 01:52:40,120
Sure. You too.

1151
01:52:41,590 --> 01:52:43,010
I'm leaving now.

1152
01:52:43,010 --> 01:52:44,250
Good night.

1153
01:52:44,880 --> 01:52:45,860
Night.

1154
01:53:11,070 --> 01:53:12,590
Welcome home.

1155
01:53:13,020 --> 01:53:14,550
It's finished.

1156
01:53:14,550 --> 01:53:16,100
Now we'll see
how she flies.

1157
01:53:16,380 --> 01:53:18,030
Congratulations.

1158
01:53:18,030 --> 01:53:19,600
You worked so hard.

1159
01:53:20,330 --> 01:53:23,220
She's on her way to the field.

1160
01:53:23,220 --> 01:53:25,790
I'll probably spend
a few nights there.

1161
01:53:26,750 --> 01:53:28,460
You must be tired.

1162
01:53:30,760 --> 01:53:32,240
A little.

1163
01:53:32,240 --> 01:53:34,880
I'm sure it will fly beautifully.

1164
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:37,260
Yes, she'll fly.

1165
01:53:38,520 --> 01:53:40,870
I couldn't have done it
without you.

1166
01:53:41,220 --> 01:53:43,310
I love you, Jiro.

1167
01:53:43,880 --> 01:53:45,480
Nahoko...

1168
01:54:38,660 --> 01:54:39,970
I'm off.

1169
01:54:39,970 --> 01:54:41,600
Good luck.

1170
01:55:07,860 --> 01:55:09,590
Why, Nahoko. You're up.

1171
01:55:10,150 --> 01:55:12,740
I'm feeling much better today.

1172
01:55:12,740 --> 01:55:15,010
I'm going for a walk.

1173
01:55:15,010 --> 01:55:17,910
Just be careful
not to tire yourself.

1174
01:55:19,030 --> 01:55:21,460
The room's still a mess.

1175
01:55:21,460 --> 01:55:23,220
I'll straighten up
when I get back.

1176
01:55:23,750 --> 01:55:26,020
All right. Enjoy yourself.

1177
01:55:26,020 --> 01:55:28,730
Kayo's coming today.
That will be nice.

1178
01:55:29,010 --> 01:55:30,920
Yes. I'll be back soon.

1179
01:56:12,400 --> 01:56:14,460
Please come in.

1180
01:56:20,590 --> 01:56:22,470
Oh no.

1181
01:56:31,110 --> 01:56:32,890
Look, she left letters!

1182
01:56:32,890 --> 01:56:34,380
One of them's for me.

1183
01:56:40,280 --> 01:56:43,050
She's going to the sanatorium!

1184
01:56:43,050 --> 01:56:44,760
I'll bring her back.

1185
01:56:44,760 --> 01:56:46,140
No! Let her go.

1186
01:56:49,120 --> 01:56:52,670
We shouldn't do anything
until her train leaves.

1187
01:56:54,290 --> 01:56:58,010
She wants him to
remember her as she was.

1188
01:57:44,930 --> 01:57:46,530
This is wonderful.

1189
01:57:46,530 --> 01:57:48,860
Just think, that's one of ours.

1190
01:57:48,860 --> 01:57:50,870
How's her speed?

1191
01:57:51,160 --> 01:57:54,460
Sorry, the numbers are too high.
We're checking them again.

1192
01:57:54,800 --> 01:57:56,000
How fast?

1193
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:57,690
240 knots.

1194
01:57:57,690 --> 01:57:59,260
240?!

1195
01:58:34,420 --> 01:58:35,550
Fantastic!

1196
01:58:35,550 --> 01:58:37,420
What a fighter.

1197
01:58:38,730 --> 01:58:40,090
Hey, Jiro.

1198
01:58:40,520 --> 01:58:41,780
Jiro!

1199
01:58:49,740 --> 01:58:51,760
She flies like a dream.

1200
01:58:51,760 --> 01:58:52,600
Thank you.

1201
02:00:05,360 --> 02:00:08,740
We meet again, Japanese boy.

1202
02:00:09,990 --> 02:00:11,200
Mr. Caproni...

1203
02:00:14,910 --> 02:00:18,150
This is where we first met.

1204
02:00:18,150 --> 02:00:20,540
Our kingdom of dreams.

1205
02:00:21,080 --> 02:00:22,820
Or the land of the dead.

1206
02:00:22,820 --> 02:00:26,120
Not quite. In some ways, yes.

1207
02:00:26,120 --> 02:00:28,300
Those ten years in the sun,

1208
02:00:28,300 --> 02:00:30,240
did you live them
to the fullest?

1209
02:00:30,240 --> 02:00:31,120
Yes.

1210
02:00:31,120 --> 02:00:33,320
Things fell apart
toward the end, though.

1211
02:00:33,320 --> 02:00:36,000
That's what it means
to lose a war.

1212
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,560
There's your Zero fighter.

1213
02:01:16,010 --> 02:01:17,430
Beautiful.

1214
02:01:17,430 --> 02:01:19,180
A masterful design.

1215
02:01:19,180 --> 02:01:21,660
Not a single plane returned.

1216
02:01:21,660 --> 02:01:24,370
There was nothing
to come back to.

1217
02:01:24,370 --> 02:01:27,620
Airplanes are beautiful dreams.
Cursed dreams...

1218
02:01:27,620 --> 02:01:29,990
waiting for the sky
to swallow them up.

1219
02:01:31,660 --> 02:01:33,590
Someone is waiting for you.

1220
02:01:48,630 --> 02:01:49,890
Nahoko...

1221
02:01:49,890 --> 02:01:53,090
She's been waiting here
for a long time.

1222
02:01:53,590 --> 02:01:56,160
Darling, you must live.

1223
02:02:00,310 --> 02:02:01,660
You must live...

1224
02:02:23,790 --> 02:02:25,670
She is gone.

1225
02:02:27,130 --> 02:02:29,500
She was beautiful, like the wind.

1226
02:02:30,960 --> 02:02:32,340
Thank you.

1227
02:02:33,470 --> 02:02:34,780
Thank you.

1228
02:02:36,220 --> 02:02:38,610
You must live.

1229
02:02:38,610 --> 02:02:40,860
First, shall we drop by my house?

1230
02:02:40,860 --> 02:02:43,230
I have some excellent wine.

1231
02:03:04,330 --> 02:03:12,800
Voices
Miori Takimoto
Hideaki Anno

1232
02:03:14,010 --> 02:03:18,890
<I>A white sloping path</I>

1233
02:03:20,010 --> 02:03:25,690
<I>Runs up into the sky</I>

1234
02:03:25,690 --> 02:03:30,070
<I>A gently swaying, misty haze</I>

1235
02:03:30,900 --> 02:03:35,700
<I>Surrounding and holding</I>

1236
02:03:35,700 --> 02:03:41,410
<I>Unnoticed by anyone, all alone</I>

1237
02:03:42,200 --> 02:03:47,420
<I>Soaring upwards</I>

1238
02:03:47,870 --> 02:03:52,880
<I>Not afraid of anything</I>

1239
02:03:52,880 --> 02:03:58,550
<I>Dancing up</I>

1240
02:03:58,550 --> 02:04:04,060
<I>Longing to be in the sky</I>

1241
02:04:04,060 --> 02:04:10,060
<I>Speeding through the sky</I>

1242
02:04:10,060 --> 02:04:20,060
<I>A whole life, a vapor trail</I>

1243
02:04:21,070 --> 02:04:25,790
<I>Even before dying</I>

1244
02:04:26,960 --> 02:04:32,590
<I>From that window, up high</I>

1245
02:04:32,590 --> 02:04:37,130
<I>Watching the sky</I>

1246
02:04:37,920 --> 02:04:42,300
<I>Now no one understands</I>

1247
02:04:42,930 --> 02:04:48,310
<I>No one would understand</I>

1248
02:04:49,600 --> 02:04:59,600
<I>All they could think was...
Too young"</I>

1249
02:05:00,450 --> 02:05:05,790
<I>Yet... happy</I>

1250
02:05:05,790 --> 02:05:11,290
<I>Longing to be in the sky</I>

1251
