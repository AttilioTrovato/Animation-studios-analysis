00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:38,232
The pot is bubb/ring;
The rice is steaming

13
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:41,478
The cutting board :Ls standing by

14
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:45,606
The tofu is jiggly
The eggs are slippery

15
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:49,610
The natto is sticky as can be

16
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,580
Drop the eggs fin a frying pan

17
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:57,164
Stir the miso in a pot

18
00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:01,164
Pile the rice in a server

19
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:04,758
Everything :Is ready to go

20
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:08,679
Mme to wake up the house

21
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:12,508
Get everyone to the table

23
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,020

But be sure to taste every bite

28
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:39,042
Another beautiful' breakfast together

29
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:42,872
And I made :if all for you

30
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:46,546
Hurry up, dig :In now

31
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:50,262
But be sure to taste every bite

32
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:12,742
Morning!

33
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,867
Good morning.
ls Sora up yet?

34
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,914
Still in front of the mirror,

35
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,284
Morning,

36
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:25,752
Night shift again?

37
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:27,916
And tonight too,

38
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,886
Shall I save dinner for you?

39
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:32,883
Yes, thanks,

40
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:35,173
That's real service,

41
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:39,102
- The hospital's short-handed.
- I got a hole in my sock!

42
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:41,434
Leave it by the sewing machine,

43
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,932
More holes?

44
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,609
My socks keep shrinking,

45
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,193
This is for you,

46
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:50,110
Pack me a jumbo lunch,

47
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:52,741
Don't you eat enough already?

48
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,578
- Here Riku, have my fried egg.
- All right!

49
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:59,536
You need it more, Dr. Hokuto,

50
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:02,956
Who's the doctor here?

51
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,922
You drown everything in soy sauce,

52
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,008
- I like it that way.
- Me too.

53
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:16,131
Breakfast is ready, Hiro,

54
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,968
Good morning, Hana,

55
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,436
Good morning,

56
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:29,736
You can share your mother's,

57
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:30,983
Thanks,

58
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,945
Can I make you some tea?

59
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,988
No thanks, I've had some,

60
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:40,914
Good morning,

61
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:46,374
Thanks,

62
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,503
Please go ahead, everyone,

63
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:56,005
Let's eat!

64
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:00,513
You're late,

65
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,512
I can't get my hair right,

66
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,519
You look very pretty,

67
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:11,027
I'm starving,

68
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:13,947
Evening rounds again, Dr. Hokuto?

69
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,584
See you tomorrow,

70
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:16,756
Bye,

71
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:42,361
Good morning, Tomoko,

72
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,580
Need a lift?

73
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,624
- Thanks, I'll walk.
- Suit yourself.

74
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:53,456
- Can you hang the laundry?
- Of course. See you this afternoon,

75
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:54,923
Bye, then,

76
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:16,145
KONAN ACADEMY

77
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,105
There she is,

78
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,446
Look what's in the school paper,

79
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:26,072
There's a poem about you.
Who else raises flags every morning?

80
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:30,243
'Fair girl, why do you send
Your thoughts to the sky?'

81
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:33,416
'The wind carries them aloft
To mingle with the crows!

82
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,794
'Trimmed with blue,
Your flags fly again today!

83
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,758
See? It must be about you,

84
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,131
I guess,

85
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,424
So it's about you,

86
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:45,348
Try a note
in a bottle next time,

87
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:48,518
Back off Math Club creep!

88
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:51,225
He practically lives
at the clubhouse.

89
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,523
All rise!

90
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,154
- We grabbed a table.
- See you there.

91
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:10,365
Nobuko, over here!

92
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,873
- I'm famished.
- What, curry udon again?

93
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:18,374
Why not? I like it.
Anyway, you're one to talk,

94
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:19,875
So? I like bread,

95
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,051
Umi's lunches look so good,

96
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,383
You should try making your own,

97
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:28,217
I could, I just don't
have enough time,

98
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,060
What are those guys
up to now?

99
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,413
All right, drop the banners,

100
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:01,921
LATIN QUARTER
ANTI-DEMOLITION LEAGUE

101
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,427
Go,

102
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,329
Go for it!

103
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,133
Look this way, you guys,

104
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:51,474
That was cool,

105
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,600
Are you okay?

106
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:55,808
So stupid."

107
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,651
- I'm home,
- Welcome back,

108
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,237
- Thanks, Tomoko.
- My pleasure.

109
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,991
That should do it,

110
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:15,490
Today's fish was really cheap,

111
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,960
Thanks. I think I'll deep fry it.

112
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,963
I have to see Grandmother,

113
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,260
Grandmother? it's me,

114
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,932
Come in,

115
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:49,199
In the black again this month.
You're managing things beautifully,

116
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:54,079
Only because you're covering
Tomoko's wages for us.

117
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,617
It's nothing,

118
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:59,835
I'd have hired her anyway,
even without the boarders,

119
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:02,879
But isn't this
too much work for you?

120
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:06,712
I worry sometimes,

121
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:11,047
It doesn't feel so lonely
with everyone here.

122
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,177
I know. But still..,

123
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:18,228
It makes me so sad, watching you
raise those flags every day.

124
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:22,516
No one knows how much
you miss your father.

125
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,606
I hope you find
someone wonderful soon,

126
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:28,526
Then you won't need
those flags any more,

127
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:33,030
- Mrs. Matsuzaki?
- Come in.

128
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,696
I'm finished for the day,

129
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,539
Thank you, Tomoko,

130
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,537
I should get dinner going,

131
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:52,651
That was quite a stunt,

132
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:54,194
No kidding,

133
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:58,658
Some of the girls
are even starting a fan club,

134
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:00,489
What's his name?

135
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:03,458
Shun Kazama.
He's a live wire,

136
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,703
- The electrician's son?
- Hiro, you're so dense,

137
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:37,450
'Fair girl, why do you send
Your thoughts to the sky?'

138
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:57,216
Thus the Principality of Wallachia
was hemmed in...

139
00:13:57,211 --> 00:14:02,889
by the Ottoman Turks and Russia,
and its territory was coveted by both,

140
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,725
SAVE OUR CLUBHOUSE
FROM DEMOLITION

141
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:15,734
Umi!

142
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,482
Sora? What's going on?

143
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,032
I bought this for 30 yen,

144
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,749
30 yen just for that?

145
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:30,203
Isn't he cool?
I've got to have his autograph,

146
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:34,754
Please come with me.
I've never been inside the clubhouse,

147
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:37,218
Neither have I.
I'm not going in there,

148
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,053
- Please!
- No way,

149
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:44,266
Come on, just this once,

150
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,267
Come on."

151
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:52,938
DON'T DEMOLISH OUR CLUBHOUSE

152
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:04,950
Ready?

153
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,371
Excuse me?

154
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:17,968
- Today's spots are very distinct!
- And they form a straight line.

155
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:20,504
A textbook magnetic Held,

156
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:21,470
Excuse me,

157
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:22,463
What?

158
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,804
We're looking for the
school newspaper office,

159
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,644
Third floor, same room
as the Archaeology Club,

160
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,225
Thanks,

161
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:49,286
Don't they ever clean this place?

162
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,516
Hey.

163
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:14,474
Hi, we're looking for the
Archaeology Club.

164
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:18,027
Upstairs.
Look for the Lit Club sign,

165
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:19,528
Thanks,

166
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:33,000
At last, inquiring minds!

167
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,541
The Philosophy Club wants you,

168
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:40,049
New members!
How long has it been?

169
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,927
My struggle was not in vain,

170
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:48,011
We're just heading for the
Archaeology Lit Club, actually,

171
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:51,887
Now don't be shy.
Shall we discuss existentialism?

172
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:54,556
Or perhaps you prefer Nietzsche?

173
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:00,903
Chem Club! How dare you
disturb our contemplation?

174
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:04,778
Better run, you guys.
You'll be there all day,

175
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:08,403
Show some respect,
you second-rate alchemists,

176
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:12,248
At least we do experiments.
Your ideas can't even be proved,

177
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:17,875
'New poets! Draw energy
from clouds, light, storms...'

178
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:21,208
'Show us the direction
humanity should take...'

179
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:24,757
'A Copernicus for a new age,
to set us free...'

180
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,172
CQ! CQ!

181
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:29,766
This is a high school student
from Japan.

182
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:57,160
LITERATURE CLUB
LATIN QUARTER WEEKLY

183
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:58,543
This is it,

184
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:03,629
Matsuzaki,

185
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:04,967
Yamazaki."

186
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:08,137
Hey, Shun!
Couple of VIPs to see you,

187
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:17,559
Welcome to the Lit Club.
Or was it the Archaeology Club?

188
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:22,185
Don't tell me you're here
about that rag we publish,

189
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:25,233
Knock it off, Mizunuma.
Come in and close the."

190
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,573
They'll shut us down!

191
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:36,040
We're down to two members.
The Archaeology Club is doomed,

192
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:42,667
Can you sign this?

193
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,340
Do it for her, hero,

194
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,515
Thank you!

195
00:18:57,762 --> 00:18:58,729
Your hand..,

196
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:03,519
Just a cat scratch.
This isn't from the jump,

197
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,274
A cat.,.'?

198
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:10,367
Wait, could you out
some stencils for Shun?

199
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:15,447
We're all pretty busy
with the anti-demolition campaign,

200
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:16,998
You're the little sister?

201
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,367
Yes, I'm Sora Matsuzaki,

202
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:23,209
You help them, Umi.
My handwriting is terrible,

203
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:26,295
You're joking. Why should I..,

204
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,334
PHYSICS MIDTERM FORECAST!

205
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:31,383
You're a junior.
Got Suzuki for physics?

206
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:34,014
Suzuki? Yes,

207
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,967
Then you need this,

208
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:40,021
Mizunuma's exam forecasts
are usually spot on.

209
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:43,937
But not guaranteed.
Bring your own luck to the test,

210
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:47,979
See you at six,

211
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,531
Shall we go?

212
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:51,987
Oh, yes!

213
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:59,581
Miss Matsuzaki,
I'd better see you out,

214
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:02,205
Our resident philosopher
might ambush you.

215
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,748
Oh, thank you!

216
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,773
From here to the end,

217
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:40,410
We've got to do something,

218
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:44,035
Yes, for the honor of those
who went before us!

219
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,790
Meeting, Shun,

220
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:35,170
Care to join us, Matsuzaki?
It's the anti-demolition meeting,

221
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,259
ls it that late?

222
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,221
I finished.

223
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:41,096
Thanks, that really helps,

224
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,019
Meeting!

225
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:49,730
All hands on deck.
Time for today's meeting,

226
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,009
I'm home,

227
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:44,742
Hi, Umi,

228
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:48,459
I'm running late. Let's do curry.
Can you cut the vegetables?

229
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:50,085
Sure,

230
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,848
- I'm back.
- We were waiting,

231
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:15,061
Riku, I need some pork,
Can you run down for me?

232
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,404
What, right now?

233
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:19,398
Sora?

234
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:22,618
But the program just started,

235
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,408
You didn't ask Tomoko
to get some?

236
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:28,078
I used it for lunches,

237
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:37,257
Start the rice
in 10 minutes, okay?

238
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:40,302
Okay,

239
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:54,855
Shopping?

240
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,314
Sort of,

241
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,819
Hop on.
Bottom of the hill, right?

242
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:05,657
Don't worry, my hand's okay.
I can use the brake just fine.

243
00:24:21,502 --> 00:24:23,254
How was your meeting?

244
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,180
Still going strong,

245
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:27,804
But I've got curfew,

246
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:32,855
Did you finish printing the paper?

247
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:37,188
You must be kidding.
I'll do it tomorrow before school,

248
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,695
Listen, Shun.
Can I ask you something?

249
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,736
That poem in the paper."

250
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:59,090
- You were saying?
- No, it's okay.

251
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:12,724
Thanks,

252
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:17,725
400 grams of sliced pork,

253
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:19,734
Two to go,

254
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:23,405
- Here you go. 240 yen.
- Thanks.

255
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:28,744
Come again,

256
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,201
Thanks,

257
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:32,907
Dig in,

258
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,752
I need energy to get home,

259
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:39,917
Where's your house?

260
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:42,754
- By the harbor.
- Gosh, that's far,

261
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:47,508
See you,

262
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,758
Thank you!

263
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:03,646
This is nice,

264
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:26,461
Can I come in?

265
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:30,347
Don't you feel well?

266
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,728
Go on ahead, Sora,

267
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:38,806
I'm coming in,

268
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:52,740
Wow. ,,

269
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:06,168
I shouldn't paint at night.
The colors are all wrong,

270
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,010
it's beautiful,

271
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:11,676
What's this?

272
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:19,522
That tug goes by a lot.
I think it's answering your flags,

273
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:23,024
Guess you can't see
the tug from there.

274
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:27,028
Answering my message?

275
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:37,034
I need food,

276
00:27:58,844 --> 00:27:59,811
Good morning,

277
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,732
All printed up.
Your handwriting's great,

278
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,227
Thanks,

279
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:08,896
Listen."

280
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:16,412
Can I help with anything else?

281
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:17,909
Of course,

282
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:22,831
But I can't stay late,

283
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:27,252
I'll give you some stencils.
You can transfer copy at home,

284
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:33,216
There's a debate after school.
Why don't you come?

285
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:36,181
Sorry, I'm busy today,

286
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:38,516
Bye,

287
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:46,729
Umi, wait!

288
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,106
Let's get ice cream,

289
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,610
No club meeting?

290
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:52,402
It was canceled for the debate,

291
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:56,118
Sorry, Tomoko's off today.
I have to be back early.

292
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:59,284
Come on everybody,
the debate's starting,

293
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:03,618
RESOLVED: THE LATIN QUARTER
SHOULD BE PRESERVED!

294
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:05,877
Good, hold it right there,

295
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:09,960
This'll get rough,

296
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:18,891
Afternoon. Heading home?
Got some nice flounder fillets,

297
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:20,976
Okay, I'll take some,

298
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:25,806
- Your mom back yet?
- Not yet.

299
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:27,641
I'll come back later!

300
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:28,816
What's going on?

301
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:39,324
We've had peace for nearly 20 years.
The Olympics are coming soon.

302
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:45,326
It's a whole new era.
Japan is changing radically,

303
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:50,164
We must build a new society
on the ruins of the old.

304
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:54,342
Tearing down the Latin Quarter."

305
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:57,804
and building a new clubhouse
is a historical necessity.

306
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,764
And the students want it,

307
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:01,012
Umi!

308
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:02,680
What's happening?

309
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:04,599
I don't know exactly,

310
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:09,441
We surveyed the students
about the new clubhouse,

311
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:13,859
80 percent of the student body
want to rebuild.

312
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:17,946
I believe we must accept
the board's plan!

313
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,698
You're like the old men
who run this country."

314
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:26,663
just blindly following the crowd,

315
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:29,161
Silence! I have the floor,

316
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:33,879
Who cares about percentages
when you're wrong? Blockheads!

317
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:35,960
Wait your turn!

318
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:40,847
Is this the tyranny of the majority?

319
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:43,722
You can't grasp
the meaning of democracy,

320
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:55,396
Want to demolish something?
Demolish your own heads.

321
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,022
I have the floor!

322
00:30:57,022 --> 00:31:01,118
Destroy the old and you
destroy our memory of the past,

323
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,410
Don't you care about the people
who lived and died before us?

324
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:07,582
There's no future for people."

325
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:11,044
who worship the future
and forget the past.

326
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:15,416
Democracy doesn't mean
you can ignore the minority,

327
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:17,668
Throw the anarchists out!

328
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:20,587
Scrum!

329
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:22,089
Eject them!

330
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:25,638
Stand fast, men!

331
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:27,932
Get off the stage. You're history!

332
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:54,296
A white?e .flower was blooming

333
00:31:54,663 --> 00:32:01,638
That day long ago,
In my homeland far away

334
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:07,468
When at fast we parted

335
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:13,520
You looked away
And didn't 7 say a ward

336
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:17,986
I remember your long braids

337
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:23,614
And the sadness in my heart

338
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:28,827
As that white flower bloomed

339
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:34,374
And the sadness in my heart

340
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:40,342
As that white flower bloomed

341
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:47,140
So what did you think?

342
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:50,511
It was amazing,
Everybody's so passionate,

343
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,475
Debates are always like that,

344
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:55,356
Most everyone thinks
the clubhouse should go,

345
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:57,522
Mizunuma's fighting a losing battle,

346
00:32:58,018 --> 00:32:59,440
You think?

347
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:15,410
Maybe you could
clean the place up,

348
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,544
it's old, but
it's such a nice building,

349
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:24,632
Make it like new again.
Invite the girls to come see it.

350
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:28,140
- Then they'll get it.
- Maybe you're right,

351
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:32,223
But the guys think
all that dust is part of history,

352
00:33:32,469 --> 00:33:35,348
The physics midterm forecast
was a big hit.

353
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:38,392
Everybody's waiting
for the math forecast,

354
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:40,019
Me too,

355
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:50,157
Thanks. You've been a big help,

356
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:53,490
- See you soon.
- So long.

357
00:33:58,286 --> 00:33:59,583
Umi! Thanks,

358
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,849
Oh no...the fish!

359
00:34:15,262 --> 00:34:20,610
...Then everyone started singing.
The teachers were totally fooled,

360
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:29,944
It sounds like nothing's changed
since I graduated.

361
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:33,789
Your president Mizunuma
is my classmate's little brother,

362
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:39,461
- Was his brother a genius too?
- Sister. She's an astrophysicist,

363
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,461
Wow. ,,

364
00:34:40,662 --> 00:34:43,461
What's all the excitement in here?

365
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:45,959
- Great idea.
- This is the best,

366
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:47,794
I'll slice some cheese,

367
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:50,013
- Can I taste it?
- Sorry, too young,

368
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:53,634
Umi, why don't we invite
some Konan graduates."

369
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,180
to my farewell party?

370
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:56,807
Who?

371
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:59,974
You know...the guys,

372
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,310
Guys?

373
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:25,916
Hey.

374
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:32,096
H-0-K-U-T......

375
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:33,719
Hokuto,

376
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:36,468
You read signal flags?

377
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:43,604
The gate's open,

378
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:45,852
Coming,

379
00:35:57,906 --> 00:36:02,628
Why not get married
and start a practice right here?

380
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,712
We'd have to move out!

381
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:06,706
You'll be married by then,

382
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,758
I'd better start looking,

383
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:11,378
Bet you find
a real nice guy,

384
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:12,721
You're the best,

385
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:17,225
- The trustees are the problem.
- The principal's a good guy.

386
00:36:17,217 --> 00:36:20,721
- He goes where the wind blows.
- The chairman's an old fox.

387
00:36:21,054 --> 00:36:24,809
When's the principal going to quit?

388
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:28,904
I think we can handle them,
but we need a strategy.

389
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:33,901
Even with a strategy,
what can we actually do?

390
00:36:34,818 --> 00:36:36,491
We need more glasses,

391
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:39,660
I'll wash some.
Here, take this out,

392
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:45,995
The sushi's here,

393
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:47,918
Finally!

394
00:36:48,415 --> 00:36:52,921
This building is 60 years old.
It used to be a hospital.

395
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:04,931
My great-grandfather loved cats,

396
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:10,437
Compared to the clubhouse,
it looks like it was built yesterday,

397
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:13,740
You really take good care of it,

398
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:18,912
So I guess your dad
must've been a doctor too?

399
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,577
No, he was a ship captain,

400
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:28,752
From this valley
They say you are gazing

401
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:33,676
We will miss your bright eyes
And sweet smile

402
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,804
F or they say
You are [taking the sunshine

403
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,758
So your mom married a sailor,

404
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:43,220
Grandma and Grandpa
were totally against it.

405
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:44,812
They tried to stop her,

406
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:49,109
So Mom ran away and they eloped,

407
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:52,980
I bet that took guts.
I heard your mom's a professor,

408
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,319
And the signal flags".
Your dad taught you?

409
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:06,792
Yes, when I was little,

410
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:15,962
He said they helped him
find his way back to us.

411
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:18,297
So I raised them every day,

412
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:24,970
I'd raise them from the balcony
until his ship docked again.

413
00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:28,227
I never missed a day,

414
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:34,354
Then his ship sank
in the Korean War.

415
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:36,027
And that was that,

416
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:39,489
But I never stopped
raising those flags.

417
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:48,831
After I moved here,
I wouldn't stop crying,

418
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:51,496
There was nowhere
to raise Dad's flags,

419
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:54,002
So Grandpa built me
that flagpole.

420
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:10,516
I'll open the curtains,

421
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:16,609
This used to be Grandpa's office,

422
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,902
Now it's my mom's study,

423
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,033
It looks like a library,

424
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:24,370
This is your family?

425
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:25,614
Yes,

426
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:27,748
Your father?

427
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:33,542
That's Grandpa.
My dad's right there,

428
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:41,050
isn't he handsome?
That's when they got married,

429
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,724
This is the picture I really like,

430
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,236
Yuichiro Sawamura...??

431
00:39:57,604 --> 00:40:00,949
That's my dad.
Matsuzaki is my mom's name,

432
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:03,986
Come on, it's speech time,

433
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:06,909
We better go down,

434
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:58,123
I'm back,

435
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:07,636
You're late,

436
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:11,136
You'll worry your mother,

437
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:24,825
- Shun, what about dinner?
- I already ate.

438
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:34,910
He swings...Nagashima strikes out!

439
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:49,341
ONODERA SAWAMURA
TACH/BANa

440
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,517
Yuichiro Sawamura...,

441
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:18,374
Thanks for coming,

442
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:20,250
What's going on?

443
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:30,761
Welcome, volunteers,
The Latin Quarter is all yours,

444
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:35,053
You have our deepest thanks..,

445
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:38,898
for helping us to preserve
this magnificent cultural landmark.

446
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:48,950
Remember, men.
The heavy lifting is up to you,

447
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:52,828
Let's do it!

448
00:43:09,045 --> 00:43:11,218
My shrine to Reason!

449
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:14,596
- No exceptions, that's the rule.
- Okay, ready.

450
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:15,935
Here we go,

451
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,609
Be careful, will you?

452
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:39,451
Hey, watch it!

453
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:03,065
1st Year Math...2nd Year Math".
These are old exams.

454
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:05,852
We use those for forecasts,

455
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:10,486
Here's Dr. Hokuto's math final.
She got a perfect score.

456
00:44:20,283 --> 00:44:23,503
Take over for me.
We need everything moved,

457
00:44:23,995 --> 00:44:25,668
I'll give you a hand,

458
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,009
Heads up, Matsuzaki,

459
00:44:31,586 --> 00:44:36,012
Mizunuma said to pitch anything
we're not sure we need.

460
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:44,644
It's so filthy,

461
00:44:44,891 --> 00:44:46,768
Didn't you guys ever clean?

462
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:49,396
Not since I've been here,

463
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:53,028
We better bring
the badminton girls tomorrow,

464
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:55,531
Please do,

465
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:28,601
Sora, I'm going now,

466
00:45:28,893 --> 00:45:30,236
Okay,

467
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:32,731
I'll be home by dinner,

468
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:53,125
Did something happen?

469
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:56,595
Not a thing,

470
00:45:58,422 --> 00:45:59,924
See you tomorrow,

471
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:57,823
Dad, can I ask you something?

472
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:01,661
I'm working. Make it short,

473
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:07,708
Yuichiro Sawamura.
He's my real father, right?

474
00:47:12,038 --> 00:47:14,336
We've been over that,

475
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:18,886
You're my son,

476
00:47:58,376 --> 00:48:00,879
It was blowing hard
the night Sawamura brought you,

477
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:07,222
He had his Family Register with him,

478
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:22,567
We'd just lost a child
of our own.

479
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:27,405
Next thing I knew,
your mother was nursing you,

480
00:48:27,655 --> 00:48:29,407
She wouldn't let you go,

481
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:36,751
Sawamura was a good sailor,

482
00:48:36,956 --> 00:48:41,507
His supply ship sank
during a battle in the Korean War,

483
00:48:42,128 --> 00:48:44,597
Until the end,
he helped us out,

484
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:49,886
You remind me of him
more every day.

485
00:48:50,553 --> 00:48:52,521
But you're still our son,

486
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:56,942
Thanks, Dad,

487
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:23,297
Is it out there?

488
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:24,799
Not yet,

489
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:38,313
Guess it's not coming by today,

490
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:18,391
THE LATIN QUARTER REBORN!

491
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:30,865
May I...'?

492
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:32,738
Come in, Umi,

493
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:39,707
You're really leaving,

494
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:41,710
Thanks for all your help,

495
00:50:42,081 --> 00:50:46,211
- I wish I could see you off.
- Go on, I'll be fine.

496
00:50:47,378 --> 00:50:48,550
We'll miss you,

497
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:53,309
I'll drop by now and then.
You'd better get to school,

498
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,598
Good luck with Shun,

499
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:06,780
Take care,

500
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:25,754
Extra, extra!

501
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:30,717
Extra edition of
The Latin Quarter Weekly,

502
00:51:30,963 --> 00:51:32,931
We'll need your help today,

503
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:35,972
Latin Quarter gets a facelift!
Extra, extra!

504
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:39,809
I'll be there again today,

505
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:42,437
Hi. You're working hard,

506
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:45,228
Hey, see you there, okay?

507
00:51:45,436 --> 00:51:47,438
Here, Matsuzaki,

508
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:54,787
Extra, extra!
Get your Latin Quarter,

509
00:51:55,446 --> 00:51:57,744
Extra!

510
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:07,500
Next label, please,

511
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:16,133
He's so brave,

512
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:27,315
- This is great.
- Let's go look,

513
00:53:08,477 --> 00:53:10,900
If you don't like me,
just say so.

514
00:53:22,408 --> 00:53:25,582
Yuichiro Sawamura.
He's my real father.

515
00:53:27,663 --> 00:53:29,882
It's like some cheap melodrama,

516
00:53:32,835 --> 00:53:34,382
I don't understand,

517
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:38,257
Dad told me years ago.
I even checked at City Hall,

518
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:39,762
But then."

519
00:53:41,093 --> 00:53:43,266
We're brother and sister,

520
00:53:47,433 --> 00:53:49,185
What should we do?

521
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:53,276
We forget whatever it was
we felt about each other.

522
00:53:57,109 --> 00:53:59,783
We'll just be friends, like before,

523
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:27,685
Sora, did something happen
to Umi at school?

524
00:54:28,432 --> 00:54:31,686
No, at least
I don't think so,

525
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:33,695
Are you sure?

526
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:36,907
That dinner tonight
was pretty strange,

527
00:54:36,899 --> 00:54:38,822
And she was soaked,

528
00:54:39,485 --> 00:54:44,662
Something must've happened,
She's never come home that late,

529
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:55,171
Umi, the bath's ready,

530
00:54:56,335 --> 00:54:57,678
Not tonight,

531
00:54:59,171 --> 00:55:00,673
Don't you feel well?

532
00:55:47,553 --> 00:55:49,396
Umi..,

533
00:55:50,389 --> 00:55:51,561
Umi..,

534
00:55:53,392 --> 00:55:54,393
Umi..,

535
00:56:43,317 --> 00:56:46,161
Good morning, Umi.
Did you sleep well?

536
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:49,664
Mom? When did you come back?

537
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:53,794
Don't be silly.
I've been here all along,

538
00:56:55,621 --> 00:56:59,467
Umi, I'm hoisting the flags.
Come give me a hand.

539
00:57:14,473 --> 00:57:15,816
Dad...'?

540
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:20,692
I'll be home for a long time,

541
00:57:33,492 --> 00:57:35,995
You're such a big girl now,

542
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:14,639
Need more supplies?
Just ask this guy.

543
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:16,261
He's in construction,

544
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:20,562
- Come on, no more freebies.
- Why not? Business is good.

545
00:59:20,849 --> 00:59:22,601
Hope you guys win,

546
00:59:22,601 --> 00:59:24,228
Thank you,

547
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:26,150
Unbelievable,

548
00:59:26,146 --> 00:59:29,571
We owe this to Dr. Hokuto.
No, even more to Umi.

549
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:32,861
She's our goddess of good luck,

550
00:59:32,861 --> 00:59:34,408
Hi guys,

551
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:38,909
This is practically
a construction site,

552
00:59:46,625 --> 00:59:48,127
What are you doing?

553
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:51,800
Give me that for a sec,

554
00:59:52,047 --> 00:59:55,597
Let me show you
how the pros do it,

555
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:06,732
Incredible!

556
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:09,447
My dad's a plasterer,

557
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:11,449
Beautiful. .,

558
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:13,235
What's that?

559
01:00:13,235 --> 01:00:14,487
The wall, I mean,

560
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:16,113
WHAT?

561
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:23,328
Hey.

562
01:00:23,954 --> 01:00:25,797
That's it for today,

563
01:00:27,541 --> 01:00:30,966
Thanks for staying late.
You don't have to go back?

564
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:35,466
Sora's covering for me.
Can I help out with anything?

565
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:41,809
Could you do this?

566
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:48,024
Can I have two days?

567
01:00:48,353 --> 01:00:51,357
That'll really help, thanks,

568
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:53,654
- See you.
- So long,

569
01:01:21,553 --> 01:01:27,560
VISIT THE NEW LATIN QUARTER!

570
01:01:33,732 --> 01:01:39,580
MAJORITY OF GIRLS
OPPOSE DEMOLITION!

571
01:01:46,077 --> 01:01:51,584
MIDTERM RESULTS ANNOUNCED,
TEST FORECAST VINDICATED!

572
01:01:57,756 --> 01:02:03,434
MAJORITY OF ALL STUDENTS
OPPOSE DEMOLITION!

573
01:02:14,606 --> 01:02:16,779
Ready, everybody?

574
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:46,304
Umi, don't go,

575
01:02:46,972 --> 01:02:48,940
Shun, it's bad news,

576
01:02:49,266 --> 01:02:52,190
The board just voted
to tear us down.

577
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:58,320
The principal won't listen to reason,

578
01:02:58,316 --> 01:02:59,989
All our hard work!

579
01:02:59,985 --> 01:03:04,081
- They won't even come?
- Then they'd have to back down,

580
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:05,323
Right!

581
01:03:05,657 --> 01:03:08,285
Mob the principal's office!

582
01:03:08,952 --> 01:03:10,875
Let's go straight to the chairman,

583
01:03:11,663 --> 01:03:15,839
Of the Tokumaru Foundation?
He's pretty hard to see.

584
01:03:15,834 --> 01:03:19,338
You guys go see him.
Tell him how it is.

585
01:03:19,337 --> 01:03:21,339
Yes, please go,

586
01:03:22,549 --> 01:03:24,847
Mizunuma, we've got to go to Tokyo,

587
01:03:27,762 --> 01:03:28,854
Please!

588
01:03:31,683 --> 01:03:35,187
It's worth a shot,
Umi, we need you too,

589
01:03:36,855 --> 01:03:38,573
Tell him, Umi!

590
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:51,207
Umi, good luck tomorrow,

591
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:09,888
Good morning,

592
01:04:11,222 --> 01:04:12,565
Did you skip class?

593
01:04:12,891 --> 01:04:15,861
No, I told them yesterday
I'd be absent.

594
01:04:16,394 --> 01:04:19,238
Then we'd better get going,

595
01:04:33,745 --> 01:04:37,249
FOR A SUCCESSFUL OLYMPICS,
MAKE TOKYO BEAUTIFUL

596
01:05:04,943 --> 01:05:06,786
Let's give it our best shot,

597
01:05:08,363 --> 01:05:11,833
Yes, that's what they say,

598
01:05:12,784 --> 01:05:14,286
No appointment?

599
01:05:14,285 --> 01:05:16,834
We're appealing directly
to Mr. Tokumaru.

600
01:05:17,288 --> 01:05:19,632
Something about a direct appeal,

601
01:05:19,958 --> 01:05:22,802
Yes, students from Konan Academy,

602
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:24,963
Three of them,

603
01:05:25,964 --> 01:05:27,466
All right,

604
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:33,146
Take the elevator
to the fourth floor and wait there,

605
01:05:33,972 --> 01:05:35,144
Fourth floor,

606
01:05:35,473 --> 01:05:38,352
Don't forget to sign in.
One name is fine.

607
01:05:48,486 --> 01:05:50,284
Are you the Konan students?

608
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:51,827
Yes,

609
01:05:52,991 --> 01:05:54,993
The president's very busy,

610
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:58,671
I can't guarantee
he'll have time for you,

611
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:00,548
We're sorry to disturb him,

612
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:04,670
We didn't think he'd agree
to an appointment.

613
01:06:06,212 --> 01:06:10,262
You may just be
wasting your time."

614
01:06:10,258 --> 01:06:12,681
but please wait here if you like,

615
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:15,347
We'll wait!

616
01:06:16,181 --> 01:06:19,105
Oh come on,
Kimura has the best pastries,

617
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:20,852
Nakamura's hard to beat,

618
01:06:20,852 --> 01:06:24,698
I can't believe you'd say that.
You don't know your pastries,

619
01:06:30,195 --> 01:06:31,367
Thank you,

620
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:02,439
it's as plain
as the nose on your face,

621
01:07:14,572 --> 01:07:17,246
Come on in, kids,

622
01:07:22,247 --> 01:07:23,590
Excuse us,

623
01:07:29,128 --> 01:07:30,926
Have a seat,

624
01:07:30,922 --> 01:07:32,924
Be with you in a minute,

625
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:37,930
So you see how it is.
Yes, give him my regards,

626
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:47,272
Sit.

627
01:07:47,605 --> 01:07:50,449
Now, why aren't you kids
in school?

628
01:07:50,441 --> 01:07:52,443
We escaped,

629
01:07:52,443 --> 01:07:55,947
Escaped?
I did that a lot myself,

630
01:07:56,781 --> 01:07:59,785
You're here about
your clubhouse, I suppose,

631
01:07:59,784 --> 01:08:04,790
Yes, we'd like to ask you
to come and inspect it yourself,

632
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:06,632
You're welcome any time,

633
01:08:08,793 --> 01:08:10,261
What year are you?

634
01:08:10,878 --> 01:08:13,757
I'm a junior. Umi Matsuzaki,

635
01:08:13,965 --> 01:08:16,263
I help out with the school paper,

636
01:08:17,802 --> 01:08:20,351
What do you care
about that old shack?

637
01:08:21,556 --> 01:08:22,808
We all love it,

638
01:08:23,182 --> 01:08:27,653
We spent hours making it look new.
Please see for yourself,

639
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:31,816
You cleaned it up?

640
01:08:33,318 --> 01:08:34,991
What does your father do?

641
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:39,366
He was a ship captain
in the Korean War.

642
01:08:39,365 --> 01:08:41,834
His ship hit a mine,

643
01:09:14,901 --> 01:09:16,528
A supply ship?

644
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:17,866
Yes,

645
01:09:19,238 --> 01:09:20,535
I see,

646
01:09:21,449 --> 01:09:25,545
It must've been hard
for your mother, raising you alone,

647
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:28,043
She did a fine job,

648
01:09:29,374 --> 01:09:30,546
Thank you,

649
01:09:31,751 --> 01:09:34,049
All right, I'll go,

650
01:09:37,757 --> 01:09:39,225
Thank you!

651
01:09:41,386 --> 01:09:43,059
It's me,

652
01:09:43,388 --> 01:09:44,560
What's on tomorrow?

653
01:09:45,682 --> 01:09:47,730
Let's see, that's in the evening,

654
01:09:48,893 --> 01:09:50,566
Move the rest to Friday,

655
01:09:52,397 --> 01:09:54,900
It's settled.
Tomorrow afternoon,

656
01:09:54,899 --> 01:09:58,949
I'll contact your principal
and do an official inspection tour,

657
01:10:03,991 --> 01:10:07,586
- Some grownups are pretty cool.
- Don't count your chickens.

658
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:10,752
I'm glad we came,

659
01:10:13,084 --> 01:10:16,930
I have to swing by my uncle's place.
See you tomorrow.

660
01:10:53,791 --> 01:10:56,795
What are you doing
after graduation?

661
01:10:56,794 --> 01:11:00,469
I can't afford much tuition.
I'll apply to a national university,

662
01:11:01,132 --> 01:11:02,805
What about the Weekly?

663
01:11:03,468 --> 01:11:06,472
I'll find somebody to take over
after things are settled.

664
01:11:06,804 --> 01:11:08,101
What about you?

665
01:11:10,057 --> 01:11:11,650
I haven't decided,

666
01:11:12,185 --> 01:11:14,984
I'd like to be a doctor, though,

667
01:11:23,154 --> 01:11:26,624
Are you the one
who wrote that poem?

668
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:32,005
I saw you raising your flags
every morning from my dad's tug,

669
01:11:33,498 --> 01:11:36,672
I can't see the tug passing by
from the garden.

670
01:11:37,335 --> 01:11:41,511
That's why I never noticed
you were answering me.

671
01:11:53,768 --> 01:11:54,985
Shun?

672
01:11:57,605 --> 01:12:00,199
Listen, I.,,

673
01:12:02,485 --> 01:12:06,206
Those flags
were a message to my dad,

674
01:12:06,197 --> 01:12:10,577
I think he sent you to me.
That's what I want to believe,

675
01:12:15,498 --> 01:12:17,592
I'm in love with you, Shun,

676
01:12:18,042 --> 01:12:19,043
Umi..,

677
01:12:19,293 --> 01:12:22,388
Even if we're related,
even if you're my brother."

678
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:24,223
my feelings will never change,

679
01:12:33,641 --> 01:12:35,689
I feel the same about you,

680
01:12:56,122 --> 01:12:57,590
I'm back,

681
01:13:02,795 --> 01:13:04,092
Let's try it,

682
01:13:04,088 --> 01:13:05,260
Mom!

683
01:13:06,048 --> 01:13:07,641
Umi, I'm home,

684
01:13:08,134 --> 01:13:11,229
Finally! How was America?

685
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:14,099
I was busy learning every day,

686
01:13:14,724 --> 01:13:16,897
Any boyfriends yet, Sora?

687
01:13:16,893 --> 01:13:18,361
Not yet,

688
01:13:18,352 --> 01:13:20,775
This is great stuff, Mom,

689
01:13:21,063 --> 01:13:22,485
it's called jerky,

690
01:13:22,899 --> 01:13:23,946
ls it pork?

691
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:26,945
Hiro, it says beef
on the package.

692
01:13:38,289 --> 01:13:39,632
Mom?

693
01:13:42,877 --> 01:13:44,925
You're up pretty late,

694
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:51,428
I wanted to ask you something,

695
01:13:51,636 --> 01:13:53,309
Ask away, then,

696
01:13:58,768 --> 01:14:00,486
I'm wide awake,

697
01:14:00,853 --> 01:14:03,982
Sorting through these books
woke me up even more.

698
01:14:04,398 --> 01:14:07,948
There's this boy at school.
His name is Shun Kazama,

699
01:14:11,197 --> 01:14:13,495
He came for the farewell party,

700
01:14:13,491 --> 01:14:17,462
I showed him Dad's picture.
He had the same photo.

701
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:20,832
He says his real father
is Yuichiro Sawamura.

702
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:41,359
This one?

703
01:14:47,191 --> 01:14:51,537
I'm afraid this is all
a little bit complicated,

704
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:56,500
I told you about how
your father and I eloped,

705
01:14:57,660 --> 01:14:59,754
You remember, don't you?

706
01:14:59,745 --> 01:15:04,046
Our first place
was that second-floor apartment,

707
01:15:04,875 --> 01:15:07,754
Yuichiro was away a lot,

708
01:15:07,753 --> 01:15:12,884
I was pregnant with you
and working on my degree,

709
01:15:13,718 --> 01:15:18,064
I loved school so much.
I was determined to do well,

710
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:35,702
Yuichi....,,

711
01:15:36,699 --> 01:15:39,077
Yuichiro, whose baby is that?

712
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:42,584
It's Tachibana's boy.
He's ours now.

713
01:15:44,582 --> 01:15:49,088
Tachibana was killed in an accident
on a repatriation ship.

714
01:15:49,462 --> 01:15:52,887
His wife died giving birth.
The Bomb killed their relatives,

715
01:15:53,716 --> 01:15:58,096
If we don't register him as ours,
he'll end up in an orphanage.

716
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:06,112
Yuichiro registered the baby
as his son and brought him home,

717
01:16:06,437 --> 01:16:10,613
The war had just ended.
It was happening everywhere,

718
01:16:11,901 --> 01:16:16,907
But I was already pregnant.
There was no way I could raise him,

719
01:16:17,281 --> 01:16:21,912
Yuichiro's friend lost a child,
so we gave the baby up.

720
01:16:23,079 --> 01:16:25,923
Is he doing well?

721
01:16:28,793 --> 01:16:30,636
I'm so glad,

722
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:35,971
Your father was so good-hearted..
Maybe just a little impulsive.

723
01:16:36,509 --> 01:16:40,139
Without his help,
I couldn't have finished school,

724
01:16:41,222 --> 01:16:46,820
But what if Shun
was really Dad's son?

725
01:16:47,937 --> 01:16:50,156
If he was really Yuichiro's son?

726
01:16:50,773 --> 01:16:52,320
I'd like to meet him,

727
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:54,827
Does he look like this picture?

728
01:17:06,038 --> 01:17:07,335
Umi..,

729
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:43,250
See you tonight,

730
01:17:43,951 --> 01:17:45,544
Have a nice day,

731
01:18:48,807 --> 01:18:50,775
Welcome to the Latin Quarter,

732
01:19:05,908 --> 01:19:09,788
LATIN QUARTER WELCOMES
CHAIRMAN TOKUMARU

733
01:19:17,544 --> 01:19:20,514
I never realized this building
was so impressive.

734
01:19:20,506 --> 01:19:22,133
Thank you, sir,

735
01:19:23,801 --> 01:19:26,270
What are you studying?

736
01:19:26,262 --> 01:19:30,108
Sir! The Astronomy Club
has studied sunspots for 10 years,

737
01:19:30,391 --> 01:19:34,316
10 years?
And what did you discover?

738
01:19:34,895 --> 01:19:38,945
The sun is very old,
and our lifespan is short,

739
01:19:38,941 --> 01:19:40,284
No discoveries so far!

740
01:19:40,734 --> 01:19:42,782
Excellent answer,

741
01:19:49,493 --> 01:19:51,791
The Philosophy Club?

742
01:19:51,787 --> 01:19:55,087
Wouldn't you like
a brand new clubhouse?

743
01:19:56,375 --> 01:19:58,844
What about your junior members?

744
01:19:59,086 --> 01:20:03,341
Sir, we philosophers
can be content with just a barrel,

745
01:20:03,632 --> 01:20:05,509
Diogenes! Very good,

746
01:20:09,763 --> 01:20:13,358
Principal, your students
are really quite impressive,

747
01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:17,525
Shun Kazama?

748
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:26,197
Hello, Dad?

749
01:20:26,405 --> 01:20:28,874
The third man
in the photo is here,

750
01:20:29,158 --> 01:20:31,206
He can tell you
about your father,

751
01:20:32,619 --> 01:20:35,839
His ship leaves at four o'clock,

752
01:20:36,123 --> 01:20:39,377
He won't be back for months.
Get down here!

753
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:55,101
Should the world sink

754
01:20:55,642 --> 01:20:59,738
Beneath the indigo waves

755
01:20:59,730 --> 01:21:04,236
Stand fast sink not

756
01:21:04,568 --> 01:21:09,415
Beneath that horizon

757
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:14,211
Stand fast against the flood

758
01:21:14,661 --> 01:21:18,757
Like a greet range of .mountains

759
01:21:19,416 --> 01:21:23,262
With pinnacles thrust high

760
01:21:23,253 --> 01:21:27,884
Info the winds of the future

761
01:21:28,217 --> 01:21:33,269
Should the world sink

762
01:21:33,555 --> 01:21:37,310
Beneath the indigo waves

763
01:21:37,559 --> 01:21:41,780
Stand fast sink not

764
01:21:42,231 --> 01:21:46,611
Beneath that horizon

765
01:21:48,779 --> 01:21:53,080
My friends, you have shown me
the Latin Quarter's true value.

766
01:21:53,075 --> 01:21:57,125
How can we educate the young
without protecting our culture?

767
01:21:58,956 --> 01:22:03,632
I'll just find a different site
for the new building.

768
01:22:05,462 --> 01:22:08,136
All right!

769
01:22:08,674 --> 01:22:10,802
Umi, you did it,

770
01:22:11,093 --> 01:22:12,640
We all did it,

771
01:22:12,886 --> 01:22:15,480
Awesome! Magnificent!

772
01:22:21,812 --> 01:22:24,315
On to the next experiment,

773
01:22:25,524 --> 01:22:27,822
Umi, we owe this to you,

774
01:22:28,819 --> 01:22:31,322
But I didn't do anything special,

775
01:22:31,613 --> 01:22:34,241
Fixing things up was your idea,

776
01:22:34,241 --> 01:22:35,333
She's right,

777
01:22:35,325 --> 01:22:37,498
Thank you, Umi,

778
01:22:39,621 --> 01:22:41,373
Good for you, Umi,

779
01:22:42,749 --> 01:22:43,500
Umi!

780
01:22:49,256 --> 01:22:50,849
The perfect couple,

781
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:55,228
Please excuse them, sir,

782
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:58,349
Something very important
is happening to both of them,

783
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:00,392
They have to hurry,

784
01:23:01,018 --> 01:23:04,693
Escape...
it's great to be young,

785
01:23:09,151 --> 01:23:10,368
Shun!

786
01:23:10,903 --> 01:23:12,871
Give us a ride,

787
01:23:13,614 --> 01:23:15,036
Umi?

788
01:23:24,082 --> 01:23:27,712
Don't worry Umi,
I'll get you there in time,

789
01:23:39,097 --> 01:23:40,690
We'd better run,

790
01:23:40,682 --> 01:23:42,059
Thanks!

791
01:23:43,477 --> 01:23:45,400
Good luck, Umi,

792
01:23:52,819 --> 01:23:55,572
Come on, Shun. Hurry!

793
01:23:56,782 --> 01:23:57,908
Thanks,

794
01:24:27,396 --> 01:24:29,148
That's my dad's tug,

795
01:24:56,174 --> 01:24:58,302
Here they are, captain,

796
01:25:07,644 --> 01:25:09,942
Push our departure back
15 minutes.

797
01:25:14,484 --> 01:25:17,988
So you're Tachibana's boy,

798
01:25:19,448 --> 01:25:21,997
And you must be
Sawamura's daughter,

799
01:25:22,284 --> 01:25:23,661
Both fine-looking youngsters,

800
01:25:39,468 --> 01:25:41,186
it's Shun, right?

801
01:25:41,928 --> 01:25:44,681
Your father was Hiroshi Tachibana,

802
01:25:44,973 --> 01:25:47,852
Front row, fourth from the right,

803
01:25:48,393 --> 01:25:50,862
You can see Sawamura
next to him,

804
01:25:51,563 --> 01:25:54,032
We three were close friends,

805
01:25:55,233 --> 01:25:57,986
Take the seat of honor, Tachibana,

806
01:25:57,986 --> 01:25:58,987
Why me?

807
01:25:58,987 --> 01:26:01,206
You're our leader.
You belong there.

808
01:26:01,448 --> 01:26:03,871
All right, let's do it,

809
01:26:06,578 --> 01:26:09,206
Just don't die before me, okay?

810
01:26:10,082 --> 01:26:11,709
Same goes for you,

811
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:13,589
Here we go,

812
01:26:26,014 --> 01:26:30,565
I was away at sea
when your parents passed on,

813
01:26:30,852 --> 01:26:34,231
Otherwise I'd have done
exactly what Sawamura did,

814
01:26:35,524 --> 01:26:40,075
Meeting you two
is like seeing my old friends again,

815
01:26:40,362 --> 01:26:43,536
Thank you both.
I've never been so happy,

816
01:27:04,052 --> 01:27:10,651
Across the shining sea,
A ship disappears in the sunlight

817
01:27:10,976 --> 01:27:17,780
Its horn trails a note of farewell

818
01:27:18,108 --> 01:27:24,457
If walk down that gentle slope

819
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:31,339
Will I feel e breeze the color of summer?

820
01:27:31,663 --> 01:27:38,137
My love is a melody

821
01:27:38,462 --> 01:27:44,185
I sing if high and low

822
01:27:45,218 --> 01:27:51,817
My love is a seagull

823
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:57,982
That soars and swoops

824
01:27:59,024 --> 01:28:04,997
If I call out to you at twilight

825
01:28:07,699 --> 01:28:12,751
Will I see you there my sweet?

826
01:28:45,195 --> 01:28:51,874
Swaying branches along the path

827
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:58,714
Leave farewell shadows an the ground

828
01:28:59,042 --> 01:29:05,721
A weather vane rooster, an old chapel

829
01:29:06,007 --> 01:29:12,561
Will I see a city steeped in summer hues?

830
01:29:12,848 --> 01:29:19,231
Yesterday? Love is my tears

831
01:29:19,563 --> 01:29:25,241
They dry and vanish with time

832
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:33,082
Tomorrowis love is a refrain

833
01:29:33,368 --> 01:29:39,751
Words without end

834
01:29:40,208 --> 01:29:46,432
If we meet at twilight

835
01:29:47,048 --> 01:29:55,934
Will you hold me in your arms?
