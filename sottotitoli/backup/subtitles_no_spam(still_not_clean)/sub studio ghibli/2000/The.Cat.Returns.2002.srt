1
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:34,910
IF YOU FIND YOURSELF TROUBLED
BY SOMETHING MYSTERIOUS

2
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:37,079
OR A PROBLEM YOU CAN'T SOLVE,

3
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:39,665
THERE'S SOMEWHERE YOU CAN GO,

4
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,792
A PLACE WHERE...

5
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:03,397
Oh no!

6
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:06,567
-Haru, are you up?
-I am now.

7
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,164
Morning.

8
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:25,002
I mean, really.
Why bother to set your alarm?

9
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:26,503
Bye.

10
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,255
No breakfast? It's so delicious.

11
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:33,802
Oh, so delicious.

12
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:36,388
You're awful!

13
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:37,931
Bye!

14
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:01,955
My shoe!

15
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:08,420
Excuse me... Oh, come on!

16
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,927
"The Kingdom is gone...

17
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:18,430
yet the mountains and rivers remain.

18
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:21,141
And the castle is draped...

19
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:24,019
in the vivid green of spring."

20
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:25,729
Miss Yoshioka.

21
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:28,023
Nice of you to join us. Sit down.

22
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:29,191
Yes, sir.

23
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:32,653
Caught again.

24
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:08,855
I hate this.

25
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:12,109
Humiliated in front of the whole class.

26
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,236
Machida was laughing too.

27
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:15,779
I noticed that.

28
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,324
Why? What's wrong with me?

29
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,787
It must be some kind of omen.

30
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:27,124
Something even worse is going to happen.

31
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,376
Usually someone would be encouraging.

32
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:37,926
HOMEMADE CAKES

33
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:39,553
What an unusual cat.

34
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,558
What's so great about Machida?

35
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,852
He's just so cool.

36
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,771
-Then tell him.
-He's taken.

37
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:52,274
Ah, the freshman. She's pretty hot.

38
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:53,275
So you knew.

39
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:56,778
If he ignores you, I'll comfort you.

40
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,238
You're horrible!

41
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:03,243
-Tsuge is so cool.
-If he ignores you...

42
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:13,086
-He was carrying something.
-Stolen goods?

43
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,004
Who knows?

44
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:22,888
What's he doing?

45
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:26,850
Hey cat, watch out!

46
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,231
-Oh well.
-Hey, that's dangerous.

47
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:34,608
What?

48
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:42,866
What's he doing?

49
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:44,910
Haru, wait!

50
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:53,668
You've got it!

51
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,512
Hey! Stop that truck!

52
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:12,062
Are you okay, cat?

53
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:31,581
I'm grateful.
I think you just saved my life.

54
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,084
I hope you're all right.

55
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,215
I'm sorry, but I must hurry.

56
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:42,217
I will thank you properly another day.

57
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,177
Don't mention it.

58
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,015
Haru!

59
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,774
Oh, you broke it.

60
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,735
Well, a cat's life is more important.

61
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,362
Did you see that?

62
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:04,781
He bowed to me.

63
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:08,285
Haru, are you okay?

64
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,044
I'm home.

65
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,172
Watch your step.

66
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:25,510
I just can't decide which pattern to use.

67
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,846
Honey, can you make dinner?

68
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:29,806
Mom?

69
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:32,642
Can cats talk?

70
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,479
Well, let's see...

71
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:42,819
What?

72
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,780
You reminded me of something.

73
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:48,199
When you were little...

74
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:51,578
you used to say you could talk to cats.

75
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,038
I did?

76
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,873
Yes, don't you remember?

77
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:19,814
What's wrong?

78
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,527
Oh, you're hungry.

79
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,112
Do you like fish?

80
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,950
Here, have some of these.

81
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,662
You need a bath.

82
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:35,205
Taste good?

83
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:39,793
Ah, I see.

84
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,671
Want some more?

85
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,799
Here, eat them all.

86
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,599
You don't have to thank me.

87
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:57,310
-Haru?
-Mom!

88
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:02,148
-What were you doing?
-Talking to a cat.

89
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:07,696
I asked you what the cat said.

90
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:13,243
You answered,
"It's tough to survive in this world."

91
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,663
You were so serious,
I couldn't help laughing.

92
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,462
I totally forgot about that.

93
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:29,342
Anyway, better not
miss breakfast tomorrow.

94
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,807
YOSHIOKA

95
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:28,837
YOSHIOKA
AOI CITY WAKABADAI 1-5

96
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:30,922
Um... please come out.

97
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:37,804
A bit closer.

98
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,688
Allow me to introduce...

99
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:49,315
the King of the Kingdom of Cats.

100
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,151
A king among kings.

101
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:53,736
The Cat King!

102
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,033
That's me.

103
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:04,122
The cat whose life you saved...

104
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:07,292
was Prince Lune, His Majesty's son.

105
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,128
For this important service
to the Kingdom...

106
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:13,298
His Majesty wishes
to express his gratitude.

107
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,515
Thanks a bunch.

108
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:28,271
Here's your program.

109
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:35,987
Starting tomorrow...

110
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:39,657
unlimited happiness will be yours.

111
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:43,536
Thanks.

112
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:47,040
See you.

113
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,576
What a dream.

114
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:29,207
So you mean...

115
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,917
it wasn't you?

116
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:34,796
You must be joking.

117
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:37,173
Then who did this?

118
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:45,932
Haru, get down here!

119
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:49,060
What on earth is this?

120
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:52,814
Cattails?

121
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:56,275
I'm working too hard.
I better go back to bed.

122
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:10,039
STOP

123
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,416
No!

124
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:12,792
Why?

125
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:17,714
Haru, here's one
of the troublesome sticks!

126
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,507
Morning! Sorry, gotta run.

127
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,723
-What's she up to?
-Maybe she's got catnip.

128
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,641
Catnip? Why?

129
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:29,600
Who knows?

130
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,938
Hey Yoshioka, leave your cats at home.

131
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:36,107
They're not mine!

132
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:39,986
What is going on?

133
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,516
It wasn't a dream. They were serious.

134
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:13,644
Maybe I shouldn't have saved that cat.

135
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,407
-Haru.
-Wha... What now?

136
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,701
Did you lose your cat posse?

137
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:33,498
Oh, sure. No problem. The cats are gone.

138
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:35,249
That's good.

139
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,879
Listen, I really need your help.

140
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:43,966
Can you fill in for me? Tsuge has a match.

141
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,552
I'll miss it if I don't leave
right after class.

142
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:47,678
Please!

143
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:50,473
Sure, I guess.

144
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:52,725
Cleanup duty, right?

145
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:54,685
Haru, you're the best.

146
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:06,447
Go for it, Tsuge!

147
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:12,370
Tsuge wins! He's so cool.

148
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:41,065
-Watch the step.
-Thank you.

149
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,277
Ow, that hurt.

150
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:47,780
Oh no!

151
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,657
What a mess.

152
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,325
Hey, come back.

153
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:06,799
What's wrong with me, anyway?

154
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:09,427
There you are. Miss Haru! Miss Haru!

155
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:22,482
You cats!
One thing after another all morning.

156
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:24,692
You must be pleased.

157
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:25,902
I'm not!

158
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,029
I don't understand.

159
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:32,992
The whole kingdom
just wants you to be happy.

160
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:36,996
You don't get it. I don't eat mice.

161
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,499
I don't like cattails or catnip.

162
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,251
How astonishing.

163
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,295
Please pardon our ignorance...

164
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:47,340
but this is quite unexpected.

165
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:50,176
How will I tell His Majesty?

166
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:52,845
I'm sorry if I upset you.

167
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:54,639
I've said too much.

168
00:16:56,682 --> 00:17:00,102
Lots of stuff's been going on.

169
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:02,605
What kind of stuff?

170
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:05,816
Just stuff, that's all.

171
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:07,985
I see. That's too bad.

172
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:11,989
Even a beautiful lady
like yourself has problems.

173
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,660
Oh, come on.

174
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:19,288
No, I'm serious.
Your problems are our problems.

175
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,958
It's our duty to make you happy.

176
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,418
-There's more?
-Indeed.

177
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:29,549
We invite you to visit
the Kingdom of Cats.

178
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:31,300
The Kingdom of Cats?

179
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,011
It's heaven on earth.

180
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:36,973
Beautiful scenery and scrumptious food.

181
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:40,685
The whole kingdom
is ready to welcome you.

182
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:43,646
And there's more!

183
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,107
His Majesty is very eager...

184
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:49,610
to repay you for saving Prince Lune.

185
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:53,197
You and the prince shall be married!

186
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:59,287
No way. That's completely impossible.

187
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:01,289
I mean, he's a cat.

188
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:03,291
What's wrong with that?

189
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:06,794
He's not only a cat, he's cool!

190
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:09,964
He is?

191
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:22,810
Hmm...

192
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,813
It might be nice after all.

193
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,400
Just lying around all day...

194
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:30,610
Exactly!

195
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:32,194
It sounds perfect.

196
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,323
Gourmet food, then a nice nap.

197
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:38,034
Nobody bugging you.

198
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:40,703
But marrying a cat would be weird.

199
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:43,122
Even if he is a... huh?

200
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:47,376
Very good. We'll see you tonight.

201
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:51,047
What do you mean? Hey, wait!

202
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:55,092
Ouch...

203
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:58,012
That one really hurt.

204
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:00,431
I need to think.

205
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:03,267
I mean... the thing is...

206
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:06,312
What do I do? Those cats mean business.

207
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:08,147
They'll kidnap me for sure.

208
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,232
I'll be a cat's bride!

209
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:20,034
No, no, not that!

210
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,204
<i>Haru...Haru...</i>

211
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,498
Where are you?

212
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:28,417
<i>Go to the Cat Business Office.</i>

213
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:29,543
<i>They'll help you there.</i>

214
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:34,298
Who's that? Where are you?

215
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,050
What's the Cat Business Office?

216
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:38,010
<i>They're sure to help.</i>

217
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:42,014
<i>A big white cat will show you the way.</i>

218
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:44,433
A big white cat?

219
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:48,396
<i>Go to the crossroad.</i>

220
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,189
<i>He'll be waiting for you.</i>

221
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:10,710
What's a cat business office anyway?

222
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:17,633
How do I find some big white cat?

223
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:22,179
But the voice was beautiful.
Maybe the cat is too.

224
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:27,101
All this walking around is getting to me.

225
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:30,146
Time for a break.

226
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:33,774
Wait, what's going on?

227
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,445
Such a fat cat!

228
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:39,739
What are you doing there?

229
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,242
A big white cat. Is this the one?

230
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:47,413
I'm looking for the Cat Business Office.

231
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,169
I need some help.

232
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:02,970
Guess I got the wrong guy...
or the wrong cat.

233
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:04,638
Sorry I sat on you.

234
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:09,185
-Follow me.
-You!

235
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:13,814
Hey wait up, would you?

236
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:42,092
Can't we just walk on the street?

237
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,303
You're just mad at me.

238
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:46,388
Because I called you fat?

239
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,376
Huh?

240
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:11,390
What a strange place.

241
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:39,084
So, where's the Cat Business Office?

242
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:43,672
Hello?

243
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:45,424
I've got a problem.

244
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:48,469
I'll be taken to the Cat Kingdom.

245
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,570
What kind of place is this?

246
00:24:27,675 --> 00:24:29,635
Hey Baron! Got a visitor.

247
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,804
Cut the theatrics and get out here.

248
00:24:58,122 --> 00:25:00,165
Welcome to the Cat Business Office.

249
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:04,962
Cool...

250
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:09,925
Our world overlaps
with yours, but it's different.

251
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:12,344
Sometimes, when people create something...

252
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:15,222
and they put their heart into it...

253
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:18,976
their creation comes alive,
with its own soul.

254
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:21,311
Like me. Like him.

255
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,742
Oh my gosh!

256
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:37,369
This is Toto, our resident gargoyle.

257
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:41,081
Baron, you rarely have visitors.

258
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:43,625
She's rather charming, isn't she?

259
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:45,210
"Baron"?

260
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:48,922
I'm Baron Humbert von Gikkingen.

261
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:51,967
My maker named me.

262
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:53,844
So you're Baron.

263
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:55,971
I heard about you.

264
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:58,849
Trouble with cats? From the Cat Kingdom?

265
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:01,018
That's right.

266
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:03,645
I saved a cat from getting run over.

267
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:06,565
Now they want me to visit their kingdom.

268
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,443
To pay you back? It figures.

269
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,487
A goody two-shoes.

270
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,618
You shouldn't have bothered.

271
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:19,953
You're as cynical as ever, Muta.

272
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,582
Don't you understand? She saved his life.

273
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:27,211
And look what she gets.

274
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:29,296
Never mess with other people's business.

275
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:33,717
Where did you meet?

276
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:37,471
At the crossroad.
She knew about the office.

277
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:42,434
I heard a voice.

278
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,186
I didn't recognize it.

279
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:47,564
-A voice?
-And you did what it said?

280
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:49,316
That's the dumbest... Ouch!

281
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,320
-Watch it!
-Why don't you hold your tongue?

282
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:55,113
Butt out!

283
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:58,033
Please, don't fight because of me.

284
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,326
Ouch!

285
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:00,536
And your name is?

286
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:03,413
Oh, it's Haru. My name is Haru.

287
00:27:03,831 --> 00:27:05,833
Okay, Haru. Please come in.

288
00:27:07,918 --> 00:27:09,169
Don't worry about them.

289
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,338
You lousy blackbird!

290
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:13,966
I'm a crow, you stupid cat!

291
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:17,177
Where are you? It's too dark.

292
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:20,722
You're so fat you glow in the dark.

293
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:26,186
-Go get fried, chicken wings.
-Moo shu pork!

294
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:34,486
Pardon me.

295
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,032
Wow, this place is gorgeous.

296
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,994
-Come in and have a seat.
-Thanks.

297
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:45,747
Tea, with lemon or milk?

298
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:46,832
Milk, please.

299
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:58,093
I love this style.

300
00:27:59,136 --> 00:28:00,929
-Here you are.
-Thank you.

301
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:05,142
Cute.

302
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,769
My special blend.

303
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:11,189
I can't guarantee the flavor.
It's different every time.

304
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:16,820
This is good. This is really good.

305
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:18,322
You're lucky.

306
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,575
How can you drink that bitter stuff?

307
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:25,871
Too refined for you, I bet.

308
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,706
Go catch a worm, bird.

309
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:33,378
Muta, tell me
about the Kingdom of Cats again.

310
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:35,923
The whole place is fake.

311
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:39,092
It's for cats who don't know
where they belong.

312
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:40,761
Where they belong?

313
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,513
One cat told me...

314
00:28:43,597 --> 00:28:46,892
their king wants me to marry his son.

315
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:49,561
Why don't you do it?

316
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:50,562
No way.

317
00:28:50,771 --> 00:28:52,272
Might not be bad.

318
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:53,899
That's absurd!

319
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:55,776
Could be interesting.

320
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:57,194
I see.

321
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:03,200
I've always wanted to visit
the Kingdom of Cats.

322
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:04,826
Maybe it's time.

323
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:08,080
You've got guts. I'll give it a miss.

324
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:09,915
You're coming too.

325
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:12,918
Sorry, that place gives me the creeps.

326
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,921
You're not taking her, are you?

327
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:18,215
That wouldn't be wise.

328
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:21,093
But, we can't leave her here.

329
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:26,556
Don't look at me.
Do I look like a babysitter?

330
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:28,684
-Are you busy?
-Not exactly.

331
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:31,061
I'd better go home.

332
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:37,150
I'm just making trouble for everyone.

333
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:40,153
I got into this mess.

334
00:29:42,406 --> 00:29:44,449
I have to get myself out.

335
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:46,702
I see.

336
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:50,038
I'm sorry we couldn't help you.

337
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:54,960
Fine, I'll do it.

338
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,255
I'll hang out with her.

339
00:29:58,714 --> 00:29:59,840
Excellent, Muta.

340
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:01,842
Then it's settled.

341
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:03,677
Haru, take a seat.

342
00:30:04,011 --> 00:30:04,845
But...

343
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:07,806
Muta's always complaining.

344
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:09,975
But he's a good guy.

345
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:13,937
I get it.

346
00:30:14,855 --> 00:30:16,481
He's just a pussy cat.

347
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:17,607
That's right.

348
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:20,027
Oh, stop it.

349
00:30:21,028 --> 00:30:23,405
Thanks for your help, Moo-ta.

350
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,826
Moo-ta? Did you just call me a fat cow?

351
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:29,619
No, but you are fat... oops!

352
00:30:29,745 --> 00:30:31,413
I'm starting to like this girl.

353
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:33,206
I changed my mind.

354
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:37,544
Didn't we have some delicious chiffon cake
in the cupboard?

355
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:38,879
Where?

356
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:40,589
Top shelf right.

357
00:30:41,298 --> 00:30:43,216
Why didn't you say so?

358
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:45,385
Let's have a little party.

359
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:49,473
Then you'll need my special mulberries.

360
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:55,687
This is getting interesting.

361
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:57,606
Can I help out?

362
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:00,484
Haru, there's something more important.

363
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:05,155
You've got to discover
where you truly belong.

364
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:08,950
Then you'll have nothing to worry about.

365
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:13,997
Baron, give me a hand
with this whipped cream.

366
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:15,665
You're going all out.

367
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:17,125
Naturally.

368
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:23,048
It feels like something wonderful
is going to happen.

369
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:26,385
Yes? Maybe that's Toto.

370
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:34,017
Miss Haru, we've come for you.

371
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:35,852
No!

372
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:38,563
What are you doing?

373
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:40,941
Hey!

374
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:44,694
Not good.

375
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:47,614
Calm down!

376
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:50,575
You promised to help me!

377
00:31:51,118 --> 00:31:54,538
A horde of cats is headed this way.

378
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:57,249
-Now you tell us?
-After them!

379
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,006
Ouch...

380
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:08,343
-We looked everywhere for you.
-I'm going home!

381
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:12,013
Careful!

382
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:15,016
Let me go. Take me back this instant!

383
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:18,937
Don't worry, every bride gets nervous.

384
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:20,522
I'm not nervous!

385
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,154
This is completely insane.

386
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:29,322
Go away!

387
00:32:29,573 --> 00:32:31,950
Ouch! Hey, let go!

388
00:32:32,993 --> 00:32:34,327
Muta and Baron!

389
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:36,329
Let go, I'm telling you!

390
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:37,581
Toto, now!

391
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:40,041
Don't let go!

392
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:46,006
-Why did you do that?
-We had to.

393
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:48,592
Why, you...

394
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:49,843
C'mon!

395
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,471
He's too heavy!

396
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:57,434
-Toto...
-I'm there!

397
00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:17,996
Where are you going?

398
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:22,792
Hey!

399
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,045
We're losing them.

400
00:33:28,298 --> 00:33:29,883
-Climb!
-Hold tight.

401
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:41,603
Now what?

402
00:33:47,234 --> 00:33:49,361
They're riding the wind.

403
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:50,362
I'm on it!

404
00:34:01,331 --> 00:34:04,084
Ouch...

405
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:06,253
I landed on my back.

406
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:08,380
What's going on?

407
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:10,006
Where am I?

408
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:21,476
Muta? You got bigger.

409
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,396
No, you got smaller.

410
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,358
Why?

411
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:31,111
Because we're here.

412
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:44,207
In the Kingdom of Cats?

413
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:03,560
This is it.

414
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:29,878
Wow, there are cats everywhere.

415
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:33,173
It's their kingdom, you know.

416
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:34,341
Hey!

417
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:46,144
It's so nice and relaxing.

418
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:49,022
C'mon, let's blow this catnip stand.

419
00:35:49,189 --> 00:35:51,191
-Not yet.
-Listen, you...

420
00:35:51,775 --> 00:35:53,985
I mean, it feels so nice.

421
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:56,529
No! You must leave at once.

422
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,868
Please run away from here.

423
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:05,538
What a beautiful cat.

424
00:36:05,622 --> 00:36:07,624
Even the cats are prettier here.

425
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,126
Please, there's no time to lose!

426
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:12,295
This is not where you belong, Haru.

427
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:15,590
How do you know my name?

428
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,301
Miss Haru!

429
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:20,845
It's that cat again.

430
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:24,224
I'm so relieved to find you.

431
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:29,312
We dropped you on the way in.

432
00:36:29,479 --> 00:36:32,065
Your servant was over the weight limit.

433
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:34,567
Servant!

434
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:37,028
No, this is Muta.

435
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:42,784
Shall we go? The banquet is ready.
Please join us, Moo-ta.

436
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:44,786
Moo-ta?

437
00:36:45,412 --> 00:36:46,454
But I...

438
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:48,998
His Majesty is waiting.

439
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:52,001
-Where?
-In the palace. See?

440
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:55,380
-Oh, right.
-Yes indeed.

441
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,676
You're not going, are you?

442
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:03,555
I should at least greet the king.

443
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,932
Are you crazy? Let's go!

444
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:07,767
-This way.
-Just a minute.

445
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:09,936
Can she come with us?

446
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:13,606
Your name?

447
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,817
Yuki, sir. I serve at the royal table.

448
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:18,862
So, you work at the palace?

449
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:21,448
Miss Haru, she'll be at the banquet.

450
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:23,908
Okay, see you soon.

451
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:26,578
Hey!

452
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:34,169
Haru...

453
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:02,572
What are those? They look creepy.

454
00:38:09,746 --> 00:38:12,499
She's finally here...
My future daughter-in-law.

455
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:21,800
I must welcome her in person!

456
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:30,266
Where have I seen that cat before?

457
00:38:41,611 --> 00:38:44,781
You'll need to change
before you meet the King.

458
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,324
New clothes?

459
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:49,369
-Please wait outside.
-Why should I?

460
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:51,871
-Beat it!
-What's your problem?

461
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:54,958
We've prepared some refreshments.

462
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:56,125
I'll wait.

463
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:06,928
I think I like this.

464
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:11,599
The dress highlights your beauty.

465
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:14,477
Prince Lune is adored by all the ladies.

466
00:39:14,644 --> 00:39:17,313
We know you'll be very happy.

467
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:18,273
Really?

468
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:21,776
No, I mean, that's not why I'm here.

469
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:24,988
A picture of perfection.

470
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:29,701
You're the purr-fect bride
for the crown prince.

471
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:52,098
Natoru, who is that cat?

472
00:39:52,265 --> 00:39:54,142
I believe his name is Moo-ta.

473
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:55,393
Moo-ta?

474
00:39:57,312 --> 00:39:58,646
What a bizarre name.

475
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:03,985
That was just an appetizer.

476
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,118
Listen, I'm really sorry...

477
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:14,621
but I'm not ready to get married.

478
00:40:15,288 --> 00:40:18,625
But I thought you already said yes.

479
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,336
That's what I heard too.

480
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:23,755
Where's the Prince?

481
00:40:24,297 --> 00:40:27,133
He's touring the provinces.

482
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:31,971
It's just... well,
I don't really know him.

483
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:34,140
And anyway, he's a cat, right?

484
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:37,060
And of course, I'm not a cat...

485
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:44,484
I wouldn't worry about that.

486
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:46,319
Take a look!

487
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,870
Here you are.

488
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:02,001
Wow, real cat ears.

489
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:08,800
I'm a cat?

490
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:12,428
Muta, where are you?

491
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,601
What happened to him?

492
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:22,689
He wanted catnip jelly
enough to swim in it.

493
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:24,482
And as you see...

494
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:28,444
Did he have to die like this?

495
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:32,365
Muta, how could you do this?

496
00:41:32,949 --> 00:41:35,034
The banquet, Miss Haru.

497
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:36,995
I can't leave him.

498
00:41:37,704 --> 00:41:39,372
Then we'll bring him along.

499
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,553
Is that Miss Haru?

500
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:55,555
Such perfect ears.

501
00:41:55,805 --> 00:41:57,515
Such soft, attractive paws!

502
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:04,689
I was told you don't care for mice...

503
00:42:04,814 --> 00:42:08,109
so I brought you a whole fresh fish.

504
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:11,654
The bride doesn't seem pleased.

505
00:42:12,155 --> 00:42:13,573
What's our entertainment?

506
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:14,949
The usual.

507
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:46,481
Not funny enough!

508
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:57,825
Oh, my...

509
00:43:22,225 --> 00:43:23,142
Next!

510
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:54,006
Is that the best you can do?

511
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:16,195
Allow me to amuse Miss Haru.

512
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:19,532
Sire?

513
00:44:19,866 --> 00:44:21,951
Well, why not?

514
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:30,126
Would you care to dance?

515
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:36,674
I'm an awful dancer.
Oh no, I even talk like a cat!

516
00:44:38,885 --> 00:44:39,760
Trust me.

517
00:45:25,181 --> 00:45:26,933
They seem quite well-matched.

518
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:41,572
<i>What is this?</i>

519
00:45:42,949 --> 00:45:45,076
<i>I never felt like this before.</i>

520
00:45:45,952 --> 00:45:47,870
<i>Being a cat might not be so bad.</i>

521
00:45:51,374 --> 00:45:54,293
No, Haru. This world is not for you.

522
00:45:56,212 --> 00:45:58,422
It's not where you belong.

523
00:46:05,638 --> 00:46:07,640
Don't you remember what I said?

524
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:10,267
Wait, you're...

525
00:46:14,647 --> 00:46:16,899
Stop the music!

526
00:46:26,242 --> 00:46:28,703
I smell a rat.

527
00:46:28,953 --> 00:46:31,163
Just who are you?

528
00:46:32,665 --> 00:46:34,709
Allow me to introduce myself.

529
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:40,840
I'm certainly no rat.

530
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:50,141
I am Humbert von Gikkingen.

531
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:51,559
I've come for Haru!

532
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:52,685
Baron!

533
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:54,562
Does he really...

534
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:56,063
Mean it?

535
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,441
He'd better not! Seize him!

536
00:47:13,456 --> 00:47:14,540
I'm stuffed.

537
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:16,542
He's alive!

538
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:18,711
Muta, you're okay!

539
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:21,505
Uh-oh.

540
00:47:21,589 --> 00:47:24,675
Stop, you scoundrels!

541
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,802
Take His Majesty to safety.

542
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:29,346
Don't let them escape!

543
00:47:31,307 --> 00:47:34,977
This way to the emergency exits.
Please proceed quietly.

544
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:43,319
Incoming!

545
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:45,071
Muta, you're great!

546
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:47,907
Every cat for himself.

547
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:50,868
This way.

548
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:54,997
I saw you before.

549
00:47:55,623 --> 00:47:58,751
Baron, I knew you would come.

550
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:00,127
Do you know me?

551
00:48:00,795 --> 00:48:02,880
I've heard about you and your Office.

552
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:07,510
If only I'd listened to you,
this wouldn't have happened.

553
00:48:07,927 --> 00:48:11,931
If you leave before dawn,
you'll become human again.

554
00:48:12,098 --> 00:48:13,057
Really?

555
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:15,726
This leads outside the castle.

556
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:16,644
Very convenient.

557
00:48:17,103 --> 00:48:18,479
What about Muta?

558
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:30,491
He'll be all right. Let's hurry.

559
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:45,548
-A back door.
-The tower leads to your world.

560
00:48:46,132 --> 00:48:48,050
It's so tall...

561
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:52,138
You must find your way
through the maze first.

562
00:48:52,555 --> 00:48:54,223
We'll make it.

563
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:57,685
Good. Please take care of Haru.

564
00:48:58,185 --> 00:48:59,353
Wait!

565
00:49:00,396 --> 00:49:03,649
She's gone. I didn't get to thank her.

566
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:06,485
Haru, this is just a guess...

567
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:10,072
but I think she led you to me.

568
00:49:12,116 --> 00:49:14,410
<i>Haru, the Cat Business Office...</i>

569
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:18,247
You're right.
That beautiful voice was hers.

570
00:49:18,414 --> 00:49:19,582
But why help me?

571
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:35,431
Thanks to you everyone's out to get me.

572
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:37,516
Let's just hurry.

573
00:49:40,436 --> 00:49:41,854
Hey, I was talking.

574
00:49:47,276 --> 00:49:48,652
Are they in?

575
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:50,613
Yes, Your Majesty.

576
00:49:50,738 --> 00:49:51,947
Purr-fect.

577
00:49:52,448 --> 00:49:54,950
They'll never find the way.

578
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:56,952
We have ringside seats.

579
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:02,833
This is complicated.

580
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:06,587
-At least the sun's still high.
-It's always high.

581
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:08,047
Really?

582
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:11,217
It's probably past midnight back home.

583
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:13,052
Then we better hurry!

584
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,596
So, uhm... let's see...

585
00:50:16,305 --> 00:50:17,431
Where do we go?

586
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:21,435
They're completely lost.

587
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:25,940
No one escapes from the labyrinth.
Right, Your Majesty?

588
00:50:27,483 --> 00:50:29,193
Yup, no hope for them now.

589
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:31,695
-And the guards?
-Here they come.

590
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:36,242
This way.

591
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:38,577
We'll just have to try every route.

592
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:42,206
Aim for the tower. That's our goal.

593
00:50:42,623 --> 00:50:43,666
Makes sense.

594
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:45,709
Muta, that's cheating.

595
00:50:46,669 --> 00:50:48,712
No point in playing their game.

596
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:51,215
There he is.

597
00:50:52,341 --> 00:50:53,717
Go chase somebody else!

598
00:50:57,429 --> 00:50:59,640
Let's hurry while he keeps them busy.

599
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:02,601
What am I, bait?

600
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:18,284
Get back, Haru!

601
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:35,426
Nice work!

602
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:37,761
Is it bent?

603
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:40,806
I needed a new one anyway.

604
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:42,975
Unbelievable.

605
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:51,483
Nice shot!

606
00:51:57,656 --> 00:51:59,158
That's one of ours!

607
00:52:00,326 --> 00:52:02,494
Sire, how could you?

608
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:04,455
We won't count that one.

609
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:07,166
Natori, look.

610
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:09,501
The guards have scattered.

611
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:11,837
They're all lost.

612
00:52:12,004 --> 00:52:12,880
What about Haru?

613
00:52:15,007 --> 00:52:16,800
Oh! They're getting close.

614
00:52:19,011 --> 00:52:19,887
Hey!

615
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,013
Welcome back.

616
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:23,223
-Any luck?
-Dead end.

617
00:52:41,033 --> 00:52:42,785
They're falling for it.

618
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:46,705
Another dead end.

619
00:52:47,206 --> 00:52:48,415
It's getting harder.

620
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:51,335
Uhm...

621
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:54,838
Wait, there wasn't a wall here before.

622
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:56,632
Must be your imagination.

623
00:52:56,757 --> 00:52:59,134
No, I'm sure we went through here.

624
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:01,512
You mean the walls have legs?

625
00:53:06,392 --> 00:53:08,852
This is no wall. It's fake!

626
00:53:20,656 --> 00:53:21,490
See?

627
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:22,908
Good work Haru!

628
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:24,243
You gotta be kidding.

629
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:25,911
What?

630
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:29,998
How often have I told them
not to line up like that?

631
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:35,254
They're getting away!

632
00:53:35,421 --> 00:53:37,172
Your Majesty, wait!

633
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:47,808
Go ahead, I'll catch up.

634
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:54,440
Show-off.

635
00:53:55,858 --> 00:53:57,651
-Baron, it's okay.
-Don't worry!

636
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:19,423
Your Majesty, please. It's dangerous.

637
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:20,841
They won't escape!

638
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:25,179
I stationed soldiers
in the tower, just in case.

639
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:29,892
Brilliant!

640
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:39,276
That's the spirit. Get them!

641
00:54:51,497 --> 00:54:53,582
Shoddy construction, I'm afraid.

642
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:55,876
This is outrageous!

643
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:59,671
We have no choice.
Give me the secret weapon.

644
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:01,965
What? No, not that!

645
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:05,010
Your Majesty, think of your image!

646
00:55:05,177 --> 00:55:06,303
Detonator!

647
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:08,430
The cable simply won't reach.

648
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:09,848
Try the wireless unit.

649
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:16,188
Finally! The top floor.

650
00:55:16,605 --> 00:55:17,564
Almost there.

651
00:55:21,193 --> 00:55:22,110
Now!

652
00:55:28,075 --> 00:55:29,368
-What's happening?
-Hold on!

653
00:55:46,218 --> 00:55:48,387
That was quite spectacular.

654
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:50,389
Let's go!

655
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:57,145
We're back on the ground.

656
00:55:58,188 --> 00:55:59,898
Now we wait.

657
00:56:00,566 --> 00:56:01,525
We're trapped.

658
00:56:04,403 --> 00:56:06,071
Follow me, men!

659
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:12,369
Gikkingen! Splendid to see you again.

660
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:15,998
Haru, I'll have you back
in the castle in a jiffy.

661
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:19,042
A cat's life isn't so bad.

662
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:21,712
Do I have to learn to like mice?

663
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:24,840
Hold on, it's too early to give up.

664
00:56:41,273 --> 00:56:43,817
What in heaven's name happened here?

665
00:56:44,735 --> 00:56:45,819
Father!

666
00:56:47,863 --> 00:56:50,741
Lune, you're back already?

667
00:56:51,116 --> 00:56:53,243
Stand at attention for the crown prince!

668
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:54,870
The prince?

669
00:57:01,001 --> 00:57:03,754
Yuki sent word for me to return.

670
00:57:03,879 --> 00:57:05,213
What's going on here?

671
00:57:07,049 --> 00:57:08,258
Haru.

672
00:57:09,301 --> 00:57:10,385
Yuki, it's you.

673
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:12,220
Good, we're not too late.

674
00:57:12,304 --> 00:57:14,681
I was just, err, welcoming her.

675
00:57:15,474 --> 00:57:18,769
And I thought you'd be happy...

676
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:20,771
to have a girl like Haru for your bride.

677
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:23,482
You needn't have worried.

678
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:25,651
I'm going to marry Yuki.

679
00:57:28,612 --> 00:57:29,780
You're joking.

680
00:57:30,364 --> 00:57:33,158
-Surprise, surprise.
-The prince has style.

681
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:39,790
Yuki, it's for you.

682
00:57:40,499 --> 00:57:42,459
I brought it from your hometown.

683
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:51,385
My goodness, it's been so long.

684
00:57:52,094 --> 00:57:55,305
I used to love those cookies too.

685
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:56,223
I know.

686
00:57:56,890 --> 00:58:00,686
You gave them to me
when I was homeless and hungry.

687
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,897
That kitten, that was you!

688
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:07,526
You're so beautiful,
I didn't recognize you.

689
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:08,902
Yuki...

690
00:58:09,695 --> 00:58:12,406
Will you accept these as a symbol...

691
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:14,199
of our life together?

692
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:18,495
Which means...

693
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:21,373
you two are getting married?

694
00:58:23,542 --> 00:58:26,461
That's great! I'm so happy for you, Yuki.

695
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:27,629
Thank you, Haru!

696
00:58:28,714 --> 00:58:31,133
If you hadn't found me...

697
00:58:31,258 --> 00:58:33,719
I might not have survived.

698
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:36,847
And you saved me from that truck.

699
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:40,726
I never dreamed
you were the person Yuki talks about.

700
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:43,061
You saved both our lives.

701
00:58:43,562 --> 00:58:44,896
How can we thank you?

702
00:58:45,439 --> 00:58:46,940
You don't have to.

703
00:58:47,024 --> 00:58:49,026
You've made me happy already.

704
00:58:49,401 --> 00:58:52,070
I'm so glad I helped you both.

705
00:58:56,324 --> 00:58:58,702
This is very moving.

706
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:01,913
So, you already had a fiancee.

707
00:59:02,122 --> 00:59:04,708
Oh well, it can't be helped.

708
00:59:04,833 --> 00:59:07,878
But poor Haru, you must be heartbroken.

709
00:59:08,295 --> 00:59:09,296
Not me.

710
00:59:09,421 --> 00:59:11,882
Now, now. If you can't marry Lune...

711
00:59:12,007 --> 00:59:13,842
why not marry me?

712
00:59:15,177 --> 00:59:16,970
Just imagine.

713
00:59:17,054 --> 00:59:21,516
You'll have all the cookies
and fish you can eat. Well?

714
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:24,978
Just put me back the way I was.

715
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:27,689
Of course... if you say yes.

716
00:59:29,733 --> 00:59:31,568
Are you out of your mind?

717
00:59:34,029 --> 00:59:37,199
Of course I don't want to marry you...

718
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:38,700
you crazy cat!

719
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:43,121
I don't understand.

720
00:59:46,625 --> 00:59:48,627
This is great. The girl has spirit!

721
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:51,588
Marry you? Never!

722
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:54,257
I like a woman who speaks her mind.

723
00:59:55,342 --> 00:59:58,136
I'll let you in on something.

724
00:59:58,553 --> 01:00:00,847
I'm Renaldo Moon!

725
01:00:01,181 --> 01:00:02,140
Renaldo?

726
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:03,391
Renaldo Moon?

727
01:00:03,642 --> 01:00:05,268
<i>The</i> Renaldo Moon?

728
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:06,978
Now I remember!

729
01:00:07,062 --> 01:00:09,272
-What?
-Have you forgotten, Sire?

730
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:13,026
The most notorious crime
in the Kingdom's history!

731
01:00:13,527 --> 01:00:15,153
A huge cat appeared suddenly...

732
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,948
devoured all the fish
in the lake, and escaped.

733
01:00:18,073 --> 01:00:21,159
That was Renaldo Moon,
criminal of the century!

734
01:00:21,409 --> 01:00:23,578
-Unbelievable.
-He's a monster!

735
01:00:23,912 --> 01:00:26,790
Muta, that's disgraceful, even for you.

736
01:00:27,541 --> 01:00:29,960
Maybe I'll gobble up the castle this time!

737
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:33,630
Quick, get His Majesty to safety!

738
01:00:37,008 --> 01:00:38,176
No!

739
01:00:40,178 --> 01:00:42,180
-Protect Haru!
-Yes sir.

740
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:44,015
Forward!

741
01:00:48,228 --> 01:00:50,105
-How dare you!
-Your Majesty!

742
01:00:51,565 --> 01:00:53,191
I'll handle my father.

743
01:00:53,441 --> 01:00:55,193
You'd better go now.

744
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:56,987
But the tower has fallen.

745
01:00:57,112 --> 01:00:59,281
It's still connected to the other side.

746
01:01:06,037 --> 01:01:07,038
Strange...

747
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:08,540
Oh no! It's already dawn.

748
01:01:08,874 --> 01:01:11,334
-Leave it to me.
-What are you doing?

749
01:01:12,377 --> 01:01:13,837
Don't throw me!

750
01:01:16,423 --> 01:01:18,466
Run! We're right behind you.

751
01:01:18,592 --> 01:01:19,718
Take care!

752
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,185
<i>Thanks, Yuki.</i>

753
01:01:29,311 --> 01:01:31,313
<i>I guess I did right after all.</i>

754
01:01:31,897 --> 01:01:35,233
<i>Saving the two of you...</i>
<i>Feeling lost and down...</i>

755
01:01:35,984 --> 01:01:38,778
<i>That was all part of discovering</i>
<i>where I belong.</i>

756
01:01:43,617 --> 01:01:45,285
-I'll cover you.
-Thanks.

757
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:47,495
Where is Father?

758
01:01:47,913 --> 01:01:48,788
Up there.

759
01:01:49,998 --> 01:01:52,209
Father, it's dangerous. Please come down.

760
01:01:52,792 --> 01:01:54,252
He's out of his mind.

761
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:55,795
I'll bring him back.

762
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:12,979
We'll settle this with a duel!

763
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:15,732
-With pleasure.
-Baron?

764
01:02:16,483 --> 01:02:17,692
-Take care of Haru.
-Right.

765
01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:07,325
I win, Cat King.

766
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:09,577
Fiddlesticks!

767
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:24,092
I heard about the cat
in top hat and tails...

768
01:03:24,217 --> 01:03:26,344
but never dreamed you were this good.

769
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:30,557
I heard you spend your days
in some shop window.

770
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:35,562
You should have come
to my kingdom and joined me.

771
01:03:38,523 --> 01:03:41,318
I'm quite happy with life just as it is.

772
01:03:44,112 --> 01:03:48,366
Where in the world am I?

773
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:50,869
What have you done?

774
01:03:54,039 --> 01:03:55,248
I didn't do a thing.

775
01:03:56,374 --> 01:03:58,960
Now that the tower has collapsed...

776
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:02,339
who knows where the exit leads?

777
01:04:02,756 --> 01:04:03,798
I must go!

778
01:04:09,721 --> 01:04:10,847
Miss Haru...

779
01:04:11,306 --> 01:04:12,557
I should've foreseen this.

780
01:04:12,724 --> 01:04:15,393
But look, she's human again!

781
01:04:24,152 --> 01:04:25,111
Oh no...

782
01:04:26,029 --> 01:04:28,031
I think I'm going to fall.

783
01:04:29,324 --> 01:04:32,160
I can't keep my balance!

784
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:34,079
Haru!

785
01:04:42,754 --> 01:04:45,382
Muta, please don't say I'm heavy.

786
01:04:46,174 --> 01:04:49,594
Okay... but before we do this again...

787
01:04:50,095 --> 01:04:53,390
lose a little weight, will you?

788
01:05:05,193 --> 01:05:06,569
I can't hold on!

789
01:05:10,156 --> 01:05:11,825
Haru!

790
01:05:16,538 --> 01:05:18,790
We're going to die!

791
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:22,043
-We're not dead yet! Look down!
-What?

792
01:05:22,419 --> 01:05:24,879
Don't be afraid, just look down!

793
01:05:25,171 --> 01:05:27,632
I can't!

794
01:05:28,133 --> 01:05:29,968
Trust me!

795
01:05:41,312 --> 01:05:42,981
Are we still alive?

796
01:05:43,148 --> 01:05:45,150
-Yes!
-Probably...

797
01:05:57,245 --> 01:05:58,830
It just hit me.

798
01:05:58,997 --> 01:06:01,124
I think we look pretty cool!

799
01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:14,179
What's this?

800
01:06:16,764 --> 01:06:18,349
-A whole flock.
-And just in time.

801
01:06:26,733 --> 01:06:30,361
Hey, Muta! How do you like
being saved by birds?

802
01:06:30,528 --> 01:06:31,362
Toto!

803
01:06:31,446 --> 01:06:33,364
It's that lousy black bird.

804
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:35,116
Thanks, Toto.

805
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:38,661
Good thing
my friends were waiting up here.

806
01:06:39,204 --> 01:06:41,122
Doesn't it hurt to be walked on?

807
01:06:41,956 --> 01:06:43,708
You're light as a feather, Haru.

808
01:06:43,791 --> 01:06:46,044
-Really?
-I disagree.

809
01:06:46,294 --> 01:06:47,462
Look, Haru.

810
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:50,423
It's my school.

811
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:53,676
I'm home. I made it back!

812
01:06:54,135 --> 01:06:56,262
Thank you so much, everybody!

813
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:04,771
-They made it!
-Hooray for Miss Haru!

814
01:07:05,063 --> 01:07:06,147
Wonderful.

815
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:08,900
Take care, Haru.

816
01:07:10,401 --> 01:07:11,819
Your Majesty!

817
01:07:17,992 --> 01:07:22,038
Natori, I think it's time
for me to retire.

818
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:24,916
Then I shall join you, Sire.

819
01:07:34,926 --> 01:07:36,427
Toto, thank you.

820
01:07:38,096 --> 01:07:41,599
My heart is still pounding.

821
01:07:41,766 --> 01:07:42,684
That's not surprising.

822
01:07:43,017 --> 01:07:45,019
But it was fun, too.

823
01:07:45,144 --> 01:07:46,437
Yeah, right.

824
01:07:47,146 --> 01:07:50,275
Well, Haru has a school day ahead of her.

825
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:53,778
She'd better get some rest.

826
01:07:53,987 --> 01:07:55,238
That's right.

827
01:07:55,989 --> 01:07:57,824
Is this going to be goodbye?

828
01:07:58,199 --> 01:08:00,118
One more load to carry.

829
01:08:13,631 --> 01:08:17,594
Baron, I think I have a crush on you.

830
01:08:19,137 --> 01:08:22,140
I like your honesty, Haru.

831
01:08:26,686 --> 01:08:30,106
You'll find your way
to the Cat Business Office...

832
01:08:30,857 --> 01:08:34,027
if you ever really need us again.

833
01:08:35,361 --> 01:08:38,031
Until then, goodbye!

834
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:44,912
Goodbye...

835
01:08:52,837 --> 01:08:55,757
Thank you!

836
01:08:55,965 --> 01:09:00,053
Baron! Toto! You too, Muta!

837
01:09:02,889 --> 01:09:05,016
What do you mean, "you too"?

838
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:08,353
Thanks a lot!

839
01:09:41,052 --> 01:09:42,804
Oh no, better get up.

840
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:52,230
Morning.

841
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:54,982
Why are you up so early?

842
01:09:55,858 --> 01:09:57,360
It's Sunday.

843
01:09:57,610 --> 01:10:00,321
I'm going to the early show with Hiromi.

844
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:02,865
I'm off.

845
01:10:04,909 --> 01:10:06,619
There's fried eggs and salad.

846
01:10:07,412 --> 01:10:08,788
I already ate.

847
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:10,623
There's tea in the pot.

848
01:10:13,084 --> 01:10:14,043
About the tea...

849
01:10:15,002 --> 01:10:17,046
It's my special blend.

850
01:10:17,296 --> 01:10:21,217
I can't guarantee the flavor.
It's different every time.

851
01:10:23,261 --> 01:10:24,679
Is that so?

852
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:30,727
Oh, it smells nice.

853
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:36,899
Haru! I've got news
from a reliable source.

854
01:10:37,108 --> 01:10:38,609
What's the big deal?

855
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:41,320
Machida broke up!

856
01:10:46,451 --> 01:10:48,286
Oh, is that so.

857
01:10:48,453 --> 01:10:50,455
What kind of reaction is that?

858
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:51,581
What?

859
01:10:51,706 --> 01:10:53,666
Don't you have anything to say?

860
01:10:53,791 --> 01:10:54,876
No.

861
01:10:55,835 --> 01:10:57,086
It doesn't matter anymore.

862
01:11:08,723 --> 01:11:10,266
Haru, did something happen?

863
01:11:10,391 --> 01:11:11,976
-No.
-Come on!

864
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:13,561
No, honestly.

865
01:11:15,313 --> 01:11:16,481
How about you?

866
01:11:16,606 --> 01:11:17,440
What?

867
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:21,486
-How's it going with Tsuge?
-Well, it's not, actually.
