1
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:05,727
Shh!

2
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:24,694
Sosuke, come right back up, OK?

3
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:25,862
OK!

4
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:44,858
Huh?

5
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:08,006
A goldfish!

6
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:21,811
Can't get it out.

7
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,580
That was weird.

8
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,092
Ow!

9
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,930
It looks kind of dead.

10
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,936
It licked me! It's alive!

11
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,108
Sosuke, we'll be late!

12
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,860
Mom, a goldfish!

13
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,070
Sosuke!

14
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,957
This wind is crazy.

15
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,127
Sosuke, I'm starting the car now!

16
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,220
Well? Have you found my daughter?

17
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:45,979
What? She was captured by a human?

18
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:51,734
A boy! This is very bad.

19
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:19,637
Is it already dead?

20
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,314
You are alive!

21
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:42,452
Sosuke, I have a job, you know!

22
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,663
Look, Mom, I found a goldfish!

23
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:49,542
- A goldfish?
- It was right down by the rocks.

24
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:54,005
Yeah?

25
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,135
Hm?

26
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,778
I don't know who you are,

27
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:19,197
but we don't use weedkiller
around here.

28
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:24,285
Hm? What? This is not weedkiller.

29
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:26,204
This is the purest ocean water,

30
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,664
and it keeps me
from drying out on land.

31
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,875
Whatever.
As long as it's not weedkiller.

32
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,044
- Excuse us.
- Please wait.

33
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:40,009
Uh-oh.

34
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:42,345
This is bad. This is very bad.

35
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:46,391
Wow. That guy was a freak show.

36
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:50,186
But don't you call people "freak show."
We never judge others by their looks.

37
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,771
I know, Mom. I don't.

38
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:54,732
- Oh. Another experiment for school?
- Mm-hm.

39
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,859
Your teacher doesn't really like
show and tell.

40
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:58,486
I think it'll be fine.

41
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,530
Don't worry, I'll take good care of you.

42
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,615
Huh! She sure is pretty.

43
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,957
There's a ship headed for dry dock.

44
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,627
Hurry up. Eat your breakfast.

45
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:18,548
I wonder if she would eat this.

46
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,758
Want some?

47
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,595
Hey! My cut is all gone!

48
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:30,143
Mom, I think I'll call her Ponyo.

49
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,270
- Mmm?
- She came to me.

50
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,105
She might be magic.

51
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:37,859
I saved her.
She's my responsibility now.

52
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,495
Want ham instead?

53
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,888
Mom, Ponyo really likes to eat ham.

54
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,598
So she thinks she's human?

55
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:12,935
Ouch!

56
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:33,664
Whoa! Turn!

57
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,960
Humans are disgusting!

58
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,879
Come on, Lisa, hurry!

59
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:51,933
All this waste, filth.

60
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,770
Morning, Shima-san!

61
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:04,445
Ponyo, look. You can see our house.

62
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:27,844
- Ask about the fish.
- I will.

63
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,805
- Love you, Sosuke.
- Goodbye.

64
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,474
Morning! Seems like I'm always late.

65
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:35,810
- Can you get me another wheelchair?
- Sure.

66
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:53,828
- Good morning, Sosuke.
- Excuse me.

67
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,873
- I'm in a big hurry, Yoshie.
- Is that so?

68
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:00,293
- And me, Sosuke?
- Not now, Toki. I'm concentrating.

69
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,377
Ah…

70
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:10,761
Maybe the teacher will get mad.

71
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:13,764
I got it.

72
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,646
You'll be safe here, Ponyo.
I'll be back soon.

73
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:26,277
Hm. I wonder if there are
any cats around here.

74
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:39,582
That should do it, Ponyo.
Stay put. I'll be right back.

75
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:50,968
- See you later.
- Hello there, Toshi.

76
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:53,596
I'll call if her cough
gets worse, but she looks fine.

77
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,224
- You good, little sweetie?
- Oh, thank you. Good.

78
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:59,310
- Bye-bye.
- Good morning, sensei.

79
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:02,522
- Good morning, Sosuke.
- Hi, Sosuke.

80
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,612
- Sosuke!
- Kumiko!

81
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,114
Look at me!
My mother made me a new dress.

82
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,200
- Isn't it pretty?
- Hm…

83
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,410
Hey, Sosuke, let's go play.

84
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:18,287
Can't now. I'm busy.

85
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,164
You're not busy. You're five.

86
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:23,960
- I am too! I have a job.
- You're so weird.

87
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,337
Yeah. Hm!

88
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:39,892
Oh!

89
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:43,854
Ponyo?

90
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:47,858
Ponyo!

91
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:56,826
Sosuke!

92
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,328
- Oh, Kumiko.
- What is that?

93
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:01,872
There are rules about
bringing things to school for a reason.

94
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,000
I know. This isn't school.

95
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,460
These bushes are on
the senior center property.

96
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:07,837
Let me see!

97
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,214
Oh, a goldfish?

98
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:12,883
She's not just a goldfish. She's Ponyo.

99
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:15,261
Ponyo? Let's see!

100
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,013
OK, but don't tell she's here.

101
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:20,933
- I won't.
- The rules are: look but don't touch.

102
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:23,102
Look at her. Isn't she pretty?

103
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:33,821
That's the most boring goldfish
I've ever seen in my entire life.

104
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:57,511
That one was Kumiko's fault.

105
00:18:57,595 --> 00:19:00,348
You should never judge others
by their looks.

106
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:05,895
Let's get you some more water.

107
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,085
Ponyo!

108
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:37,134
Ah! That was my fault.

109
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,809
There it comes again.

110
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:48,062
I hear old Sosuke's voice.

111
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:52,274
But I know our boy
is in school right now.

112
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:55,569
So it must be only in my head.

113
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:57,863
Look, Yoshie. I'm right over here.

114
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,784
Oh, that's a relief.

115
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,245
I haven't
lost my mind quite yet.

116
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:06,497
Are you ready to see my big surprise?

117
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,458
- What is it?
- I'll show you.

118
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:12,086
But first, guess what color she is.

119
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:16,590
- Hm… She… She's red!
- Red!

120
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,300
That's right!

121
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,722
- How did you both guess that?
- Come on, show us!

122
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:24,473
OK.

123
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,979
- Well, look!
- Very pretty.

124
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,356
Her name is Ponyo. She likes to eat ham.

125
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,984
And she can do magic!

126
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,444
I got a cut on my thumb,

127
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:39,488
and it went away
because she licked it.

128
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,490
Oh!

129
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:45,411
Maybe she could use some of her magic
to fix my hips and back.

130
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:49,498
I'd let a fish lick me
if it'd get me out of this wheelchair.

131
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:52,626
Well, I don't know
about all that licking.

132
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:56,046
- I'd have to ask Ponyo…
- Let me have a look in that green pail.

133
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,423
Yes, Toki-san.

134
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,970
It has a real face on it!

135
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,558
Hurry up! Put it back in the ocean.
Don't you realize it'll cause a tsunami?

136
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:10,644
Oh, you. It's always tsunami,
day and night.

137
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:14,523
Fish with faces
who come out of the sea cause tsunamis.

138
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,650
That's what they always say.

139
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:21,864
Tsunami! Tsunami! It's here!

140
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:27,369
Ah! Oh! Sosuke, put her back
in the ocean where she belongs!

141
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:32,708
Toki, what's the matter?

142
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:35,085
I'm soaking wet. Look at my clothes!

143
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,762
Sosuke!

144
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,519
Sosuke!

145
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,981
Sosuke!

146
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,527
Sosuke!

147
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:02,321
Come back here and apologize!

148
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:15,084
Don't worry, Ponyo.
No matter what, I will protect you.

149
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,919
I promise.

150
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,295
Sosuke!

151
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,425
Sosuke!

152
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:28,806
Ponyo!

153
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,561
Ponyo. Sosuke.

154
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:38,190
Ponyo loves Sosuke!

155
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,573
I will love you, too.

156
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:50,286
Ponyo loves Sosuke!

157
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,069
Ponyo?

158
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:31,243
Ponyo!

159
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:35,289
Ponyo! Ponyo!

160
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:36,373
Ponyo!

161
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:41,086
Ah! Ponyo! Ponyo!

162
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:44,590
- Ponyo!
- Sosuke!

163
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:49,178
Ponyo! Ponyo!

164
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,013
Ponyo!

165
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:53,015
Ponyo!

166
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,060
Ponyo!

167
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:52,741
Listen, Sosuke, you know,
this could be for the best.

168
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:55,202
I know you tried, but Ponyo is a fish.

169
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:58,914
She wasn't meant to live
in a bucket. The ocean is home to her.

170
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:00,249
Anyway, let's get home.

171
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:04,628
Hopefully, that spritzing weirdo
is gone. Whoo!

172
00:25:04,712 --> 00:25:06,630
Can I have a lick?

173
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:09,591
Hurry, it's starting to melt.

174
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:14,013
Dad's favorite. Me, too!

175
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:22,438
I'm really sorry, Sosuke.
But Dad is finally coming home tonight.

176
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:25,357
You can tell him all about Ponyo.

177
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:55,888
- No more ocean today, OK?
- Mm-hm.

178
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:24,208
Sosuke?

179
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,335
Sosuke? Time to come in now.

180
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,587
Maybe if I leave the pail,

181
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:31,340
Ponyo will know where we live
when she comes back.

182
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:34,843
Do that. I think that's a lovely thing
to do for Ponyo.

183
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:36,762
Mm-hm.

184
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:50,692
Sosuke, can you get that?

185
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:53,195
It must be your dad.

186
00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:58,033
Hello? Yep. She's fine.

187
00:26:58,117 --> 00:27:00,452
- <i>Are you at the dock?</i>
<i>- I caught</i> a <i>second run,</i>

188
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:02,538
<i>so I have to take it.
I won't be home tonight.</i>

189
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:05,207
<i>I'll signal you when we pass.
Can you help me out with Mom?</i>

190
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:08,043
No, you should tell her.

191
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,713
Hi, honey. Uh-huh.

192
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:14,466
What?! Too many in a row, Koichi!

193
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,884
Let someone else take it!

194
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:19,096
Go ahead, abandon your wife
and child up here on a cliff all alone.

195
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:21,098
Oh, jerk!

196
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:28,397
Uh! Come on, Sosuke.
Let's get out of here.

197
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,316
What if Ponyo comes back?

198
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,319
Mm!

199
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:40,200
Ah!

200
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:02,639
There's Dad. Turn off the lights, Mom.

201
00:28:02,723 --> 00:28:05,517
- Don't you wanna signal him?
- Mm-mm.

202
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:30,584
Hey, my son is working
the signal all by himself!

203
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:33,795
- Can you believe that?
- Your wife must be pretty mad.

204
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:37,799
S… O… R…

205
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:40,260
…R…Y.

206
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:44,306
- Dad says he's very sorry.
- B-U-G…

207
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:46,725
- O-F-F.
- B…

208
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:51,230
<i>B-U-G O-F-F.
B-U-G O-F-F.</i>

209
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,529
Mom, Dad says he loves you.

210
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:03,116
He says, "Lots and lots."

211
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:18,590
Wow! Nice, Dad!

212
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:53,500
Don't cry, Mom.

213
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:57,129
I know Dad
breaks his promises sometimes.

214
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:59,715
But he does his best for us.

215
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:02,676
I promised Ponyo I'd take care of her.

216
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:04,678
Then I lost her.

217
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,474
I wonder if she's crying now.

218
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:15,564
- Ah!
- You are so good! Mmm!

219
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:20,068
<i>♪ Happy as can be ♪</i>

220
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:23,864
- Mm! Ah!
- Don't you worry, Sosuke.

221
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:27,784
You did your best
and Ponyo will be just fine.

222
00:30:27,868 --> 00:30:29,953
OK.

223
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:32,331
I say we start with dessert
and go backwards!

224
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:34,041
It's been a backwards kind of day.

225
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,678
It's not your fault.

226
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:50,098
I exposed you to the magic
and you're too young to understand.

227
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:54,227
I have to keep the sea in balance.
It's a great responsibility.

228
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:56,480
You must promise me something:

229
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:59,232
You will never go back
to the surface. Yes?

230
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:02,361
Come on, now. Eat, Brunhilde.

231
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:05,030
I want ham!

232
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:10,744
Ham! You ate their food.
What else did you do?

233
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:12,454
Did you taste blood, Brunhilde?

234
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:16,124
My name is not Brunhilde. It's Ponyo.

235
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:20,921
- Ponyo?
- Ponyo! Ponyo loves Sosuke!

236
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:23,924
I will be a human, too!

237
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:27,302
Human? What do you know
about humans, Brunhilde?

238
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:28,762
They spoil the sea.

239
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:32,307
They treat your home
like their empty, black souls.

240
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:36,061
I was once, long ago, a human myself.

241
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:38,313
I had to leave that all behind
to serve the Earth.

242
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:41,483
Hands! I want hands!

243
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:44,111
I don't want these flippers anymore!

244
00:31:44,194 --> 00:31:48,031
I want feet, like Sosuke!

245
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:52,077
That's enough!

246
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:59,501
Ah!

247
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,503
Oh!

248
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,347
I made hands! I made feet, too! Ha!

249
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:15,016
- Yes!
- What? No, no!

250
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,519
Don't tell me.
You have tasted human blood!

251
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,229
I'm going to Sosuke!

252
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:21,231
Enough!
You're making a terrible mistake!

253
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:24,025
Don't do it! Stop it. Stop it!
Stop changing now.

254
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:27,737
Revert. Revert. Revert! Revert!

255
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:30,198
Revert!

256
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:34,035
Stop it, stop it,
stop it, stop it, stop it!

257
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:38,206
Don't change!

258
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:41,376
I need more power!

259
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:45,922
Let me out! Let me out!

260
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:49,926
Let me out!

261
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:52,888
I want to see Sosuke! Let me go!

262
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,974
Let me out!

263
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:58,810
You can't be human and magic
at the same time, sweetheart.

264
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:01,897
Be still, be still,
be still, be still, be still.

265
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:12,991
She's already so powerful.

266
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:14,993
Just like her mother.

267
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:23,668
If you could only remain
innocent and pure forever.

268
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:47,526
I don't have the power
to hold her for very long.

269
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:49,903
I need to ask for her mother's help now.

270
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:51,029
I… What?

271
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:01,915
Huh! They're headed for my elixirs.

272
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:04,459
Shoo! Shoo!
Get out of here! Shoo!

273
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:06,962
That was too close.

274
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:10,257
I must be careful not to upset
the balance of nature.

275
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,384
Calm. I must remain calm.

276
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:15,387
When I think of leaving her again,
my heart won't stop pounding.

277
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,764
Right, then. Focus on work.

278
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:19,558
This batch should be ready.

279
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:30,485
At least there aren't leaks down here.

280
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:38,243
This door still doesn't fit right.

281
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:43,540
I'll fix that next.

282
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:53,008
If even one living creature
got in here…

283
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:19,701
Ah, yes.
I can feel the power of the ocean

284
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:22,704
in the furthest reaches of my DNA.

285
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,581
When this well is full,

286
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:27,626
then the age of the ocean
will begin again.

287
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:30,712
An explosion of life
to match the Cambrian age.

288
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:34,174
An end to the era
of those abominable humans.

289
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,847
This cursed door!

290
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:05,974
Teeth!

291
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,401
Let's find Sosuke!

292
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:27,991
I'm free!

293
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:50,388
- Waterspout!
- Captain, look over there!

294
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:57,520
- It must be a tsunami!
- Turn the ship into the wave!

295
00:39:57,604 --> 00:40:00,732
Look! What is that?

296
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:08,781
Captain, all our instruments
just went dead!

297
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:15,914
It's a little girl.
Looks like she's about Sosuke's age.

298
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:33,264
- Thanks again.
- Sure. See you tomorrow.

299
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:34,849
It's raining so hard, Sosuke.

300
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:36,893
I'll call your mother
and have her pick you up.

301
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:39,938
That's all right. I'll take
the shortcut. Goodbye, sensei.

302
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:44,150
Bye, Sosuke. Be careful out there.

303
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:28,277
Sosuke, I'm sorry.

304
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:31,239
The door didn't open, right?
The power just went out.

305
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,157
- Everything OK at school?
- Mm-hm.

306
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:36,744
Lisa, if your shift's over,
you can go home.

307
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:38,121
Sure you don't need my help?

308
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:40,915
Don't worry. We'll be fine.

309
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:43,876
A little rain storm
keeps the seniors entertained.

310
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:47,255
If I were you, I'd get out of here
while you still can.

311
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,799
Wait here, sweetie. I'll be right back.

312
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:51,426
OK.

313
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:03,855
Hi, Yoshie.

314
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:06,566
Oh, Sosuke. Is that you?

315
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:08,651
It's so dark I can barely see.

316
00:42:08,735 --> 00:42:11,571
Here, Yoshie. I made this for you.

317
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:16,492
Oh! What do we have here?

318
00:42:16,576 --> 00:42:18,286
There's one for you, too, Noriko.

319
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,079
Thank you, Sosuke.

320
00:42:20,163 --> 00:42:23,958
I can't see a thing.
I don't know why we're still here.

321
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:29,380
It's just a little rain.
I wanna go back to my own house.

322
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:34,218
There we go. That's more like it.

323
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:37,138
Let's see. Your goldfish!

324
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:41,476
I bet the lights came back on
because Sosuke's here.

325
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:44,645
<i>They're now calling the bizarre event
a micro-typhoon.</i>

326
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:47,398
<i>Ship…</i>

327
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,193
Ah, this stupid TV.

328
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:52,820
Nobody understands weather anymore.

329
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:55,448
Might as well look at shadows
and listen to crickets.

330
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:57,492
You should take your mother home now.

331
00:42:57,575 --> 00:43:00,703
With our lucky goldfish
to keep us company,

332
00:43:00,787 --> 00:43:03,664
- we'll be just fine.
- OK.

333
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:07,043
<i>…landslides,
flooding and tidal surges.</i>

334
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:10,004
<i>People trying to evacuate…</i>

335
00:43:11,631 --> 00:43:13,925
This is for you, Toki.

336
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:20,515
I can't tell. What is it? It's wrinkled.

337
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:21,599
It goes like this.

338
00:43:24,185 --> 00:43:26,354
I got it. It's a grasshopper.

339
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:28,439
<i>No, it's the Koganei Maru.</i>

340
00:43:28,523 --> 00:43:31,526
That's the name of your father's ship,
isn't it, Sosuke?

341
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:34,654
- Mm-hm.
- Now, it looks like a party hat.

342
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:37,198
Sosuke, we've gotta get on the road.

343
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:38,908
Let's hurry now and say goodbye.

344
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:43,371
OK. Ladies, good evening.

345
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:46,082
Good evening, Mr. Sosuke.

346
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:48,751
Be careful the wind
doesn't blow you away.

347
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,504
Let's go. Slide in.

348
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:58,136
They said the phones are out, too.

349
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:23,494
The ocean looks all puffed up.

350
00:44:27,707 --> 00:44:30,126
You think the storm
could sink the ships?

351
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:32,920
No. Ships can handle a storm.
They go out to sea.

352
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:34,922
That's what your father's doing
right now.

353
00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:48,769
I saw a fish! Did you see that, Mom?

354
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:50,104
Put your seatbelt on!

355
00:45:00,865 --> 00:45:03,117
Hold on, Lisa! You can't cross here!

356
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:05,953
We've just gotten word.
They're gonna evacuate this side.

357
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:07,455
It's not mandatory.

358
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,332
There are some people
up at the senior center.

359
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:10,583
You should get them out.

360
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:12,501
They're fine.
They're on the leeward side.

361
00:45:12,585 --> 00:45:14,629
You need to go back
and seek shelter there.

362
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:18,090
OK. But right now, I need to get home.

363
00:45:18,174 --> 00:45:20,843
- Well, you can't cross here.
- Take the mountain road.

364
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:25,723
- Hold on, kiddo.
- Mm!

365
00:45:27,058 --> 00:45:28,601
No! Stop! Don't do it!

366
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:29,810
Watch out! Here it comes!

367
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:38,569
Lisa, you gotta get out of here!

368
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:51,540
Hold on.

369
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:21,028
The fish are following us now!

370
00:46:21,112 --> 00:46:22,613
Turn around. Sit down.

371
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:33,499
Ah!

372
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:34,583
Ah!

373
00:46:36,002 --> 00:46:38,004
Try to hang on to something!

374
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:31,932
That wave is just after us.

375
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,487
- Mom, the little girl just fell in!
- What?

376
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:46,322
She was running on a fish and she fell!

377
00:47:51,494 --> 00:47:53,079
Where?

378
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:03,464
I've never seen the ocean like this.

379
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:05,633
Sosuke, where did you see
a little girl?

380
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:08,469
She was out there,
running on top of a huge fish!

381
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:09,762
That's impossible.

382
00:48:14,517 --> 00:48:15,726
Sosuke, we have to go!

383
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:33,828
It's OK.
There was no little girl out there.

384
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:35,079
We're almost home.

385
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:32,386
There is a little girl. Come over here!

386
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:34,555
We'll help you! Come here!

387
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:35,764
Stay there, Sosuke.

388
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:44,648
What?

389
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:04,126
Sosuke, do you know her?

390
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:29,902
- Ponyo?
- Mm-hm! It's me, Ponyo!

391
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:33,447
It is you!

392
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:38,077
Mom! Ponyo came back
and she's a little girl now!

393
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,912
Who?

394
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:50,631
I found Sosuke!

395
00:51:09,233 --> 00:51:14,655
All right. Sosuke, Ponyo,
life is mysterious and amazing.

396
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:16,448
But we have work to do now.

397
00:51:16,532 --> 00:51:19,159
And I need both of you to stay calm.

398
00:51:19,243 --> 00:51:20,911
Me, too.

399
00:51:23,581 --> 00:51:26,542
You can take off
your rain coat now, Sosuke.

400
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:29,587
I've got a job for you, Ponyo.
Will you hold the light?

401
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:36,677
- Huh?
- Stay here, and I'll go get a towel.

402
00:51:53,152 --> 00:51:56,363
Here, this way!

403
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:59,325
Smells like you in here!

404
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:04,330
- Ow!
- Ponyo!

405
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:10,169
- Oof!
- There, got ya.

406
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:12,338
Now, let's rub you down and dry you off.

407
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:19,386
Look at that pretty red hair.
It's almost dry.

408
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:21,472
- Huh!
- Huh?

409
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:23,098
And your clothes are dry.

410
00:52:23,182 --> 00:52:26,060
That's because Ponyo was a fish, Mom.

411
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:30,439
- Water can't make her wet.
- Mm-hm.

412
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:33,108
I really like this thing.

413
00:52:33,192 --> 00:52:36,612
So let's calm ourselves down
with a hot drink.

414
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:39,490
Ponyo, will you hold the light for me?

415
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:41,575
- Coming!
- OK.

416
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:44,578
- Who wants to bet the water is working?
- I do!

417
00:52:44,662 --> 00:52:45,829
I do!

418
00:52:48,624 --> 00:52:51,752
- Water!
- Water!

419
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:54,630
We have our own water tank
outside in the yard.

420
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:58,133
And who thinks the stove will light?

421
00:52:58,217 --> 00:53:00,886
And light! All right.

422
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:04,348
- All right!
- We have our own propane tank.

423
00:53:07,101 --> 00:53:10,479
- OK. Let's all sit at the table.
- OK!

424
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:13,315
Ponyo, the table's over here.

425
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:20,197
Now, sit down like this.

426
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,035
Now, put your stuff down.

427
00:53:27,246 --> 00:53:30,833
- You need to use your hands.
- No, I'll use feet!

428
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:35,546
Look at that!

429
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:40,175
Uh… what are you guys doing?

430
00:53:40,259 --> 00:53:43,345
Look at her feet.
They're just like hands.

431
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:05,075
Here you go.

432
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:06,910
It's hot.

433
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:13,625
This is the best.

434
00:54:30,184 --> 00:54:31,643
Mm!

435
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:58,462
Hm…

436
00:55:01,465 --> 00:55:04,176
That hit the spot.

437
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:07,221
So, what would the two of you
like to do now?

438
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:09,181
Ponyo wants ham!

439
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:12,518
All she thinks about is ham, Mom.

440
00:55:12,601 --> 00:55:15,270
I better make some dinner then.

441
00:55:15,354 --> 00:55:18,315
First, we should start the generator
so we can call Koichi.

442
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:23,403
That's my dad. We need power
to talk to him on the radio.

443
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:26,532
He's out at sea right now,
but he'll be fine.

444
00:55:26,615 --> 00:55:29,576
- Is he an evil wizard?
- No, of course not.

445
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:32,079
He's the captain of a ship.

446
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:34,540
So, Ponyo, what's your dad like?

447
00:55:34,623 --> 00:55:38,168
He hates humans!
He keeps me in a bubble!

448
00:55:38,252 --> 00:55:40,754
- Huh?
- So I swam away from home.

449
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:42,130
Huh?

450
00:55:42,214 --> 00:55:44,132
So, what's your mother like then?

451
00:55:44,216 --> 00:55:47,928
She's big and beautiful!

452
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:52,057
- But she can be very scary.
- Just like my mom.

453
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:58,897
Ponyo, over here, please.

454
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:14,997
Mm!

455
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,791
Looks like something must have
gone wrong with the fuel line.

456
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:21,128
- Maybe it's clogged.
- It's clogged.

457
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:23,380
It's clogged over there.

458
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:43,442
- It's on!
- It's light now! Yeah!

459
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:45,694
Ponyo, you're amazing.

460
00:57:02,753 --> 00:57:06,173
- Antenna, antenna!
- Hey, Mom.

461
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:08,258
Did all the ships out there sink?

462
00:57:09,635 --> 00:57:11,970
I don't see any lights out there.

463
00:57:16,308 --> 00:57:17,976
All right.

464
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:32,699
- Too loud!
- What's wrong?

465
00:57:32,783 --> 00:57:37,287
I can't get any reception.
That's really weird.

466
00:57:37,371 --> 00:57:41,708
Transmitting from JA4LL. JA4LL.

467
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:43,210
<i>Come in, Koichi.</i>

468
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:45,963
<i>This is Lisa, Sosuke and Ponyo.</i>

469
00:57:46,046 --> 00:57:48,715
<i>We wanted you to know
that we're all doing fine.</i>

470
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:52,469
I'm taking care of everyone, Dad!

471
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:53,762
Ham!

472
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:04,564
Got your noodles all ready?

473
00:58:04,648 --> 00:58:06,400
Be careful. It's really hot.

474
00:58:21,665 --> 00:58:23,417
You have to wait a little bit.

475
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:26,044
It takes three minutes.

476
00:58:40,017 --> 00:58:42,269
OK, close your eyes.

477
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:44,646
Keep 'em shut.

478
00:58:46,898 --> 00:58:50,152
Ponyo, uh! No peeking!

479
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:55,032
Get ready to look now.

480
00:58:55,115 --> 00:58:59,870
Abracadabra!

481
00:59:02,414 --> 00:59:03,832
Mm!

482
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:07,085
- It's ham!
- Careful, it's hot.

483
00:59:07,169 --> 00:59:10,756
Oh! Hot, hot, hot!

484
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:16,470
Mm…

485
00:59:28,023 --> 00:59:30,567
Mom, Ponyo fell asleep.

486
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:39,993
Do you think Ponyo
came from far, far away?

487
00:59:40,077 --> 00:59:42,120
Yeah, I do.

488
00:59:57,260 --> 01:00:00,555
Look outside. It looks like
the waves have calmed down.

489
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:03,350
Maybe because Ponyo fell asleep.

490
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:04,768
Do you see that light?

491
01:00:11,775 --> 01:00:15,320
It's moving. There must be
somebody still over there.

492
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:17,447
That's the senior center.

493
01:00:23,954 --> 01:00:26,581
- I don't see it now.
- Did they evacuate?

494
01:00:26,665 --> 01:00:28,792
I'm worried about the seniors.

495
01:00:30,544 --> 01:00:33,088
Sosuke, stay with Ponyo, OK?

496
01:00:44,141 --> 01:00:45,600
I've gotta go help them.

497
01:00:45,684 --> 01:00:48,103
I can get there
if I take the mountain road.

498
01:00:50,981 --> 01:00:53,400
Sosuke,
I should go to the senior center.

499
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:54,734
I'm coming, too.

500
01:00:54,818 --> 01:00:58,029
I'd feel better if you stay up here.

501
01:00:58,113 --> 01:01:01,575
But why can't I come? We'll wake up
Ponyo and take her with us.

502
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:03,827
I wanna go with you!

503
01:01:05,954 --> 01:01:09,749
Sosuke, right now,
our house is a beacon in the storm.

504
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:12,252
Our light can be seen
by the town and by the ships,

505
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:14,129
and every place else is dark.

506
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:16,047
You know I need to help the old people.

507
01:01:16,131 --> 01:01:19,259
So I'm going to leave you
here in charge.

508
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:21,761
You'll do the right thing. I know it.

509
01:01:21,845 --> 01:01:24,347
You have to be
the man of the house tonight.

510
01:01:24,431 --> 01:01:26,766
Let Ponyo sleep, wait for me.

511
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:29,436
You're only five,
but you're very smart.

512
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:32,564
Sometimes, we take a leap. Be brave.

513
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:34,357
You can do it, and I'll be back.

514
01:01:35,859 --> 01:01:36,860
Promise?

515
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:42,115
- I promise.
- You promised.

516
01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:43,783
I love you, Sosuke.

517
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:42,050
Captain, I can see the lights
of a city up ahead.

518
01:02:42,133 --> 01:02:45,220
Finally, we can get
our bearings again.

519
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:48,098
We're someplace I've never seen before.

520
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:51,142
Did the storm blow us to China?

521
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:56,606
What mountains are those?
I have no idea where we are.

522
01:03:03,405 --> 01:03:06,324
That is a huge wall of water.

523
01:03:06,408 --> 01:03:08,868
Why is the moon so close?

524
01:03:12,539 --> 01:03:13,540
Hm…

525
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:15,709
That's no mountain we're looking at.

526
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:17,544
And that's no town, either.

527
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:19,337
Those lights are ships.

528
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:31,182
The moon is so close,

529
01:03:31,266 --> 01:03:34,269
its gravity is forcing
the ocean to rise.

530
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:37,105
What's going on here?

531
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:45,405
- The engine stopped!
- Try to hold her steady.

532
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:47,991
- Arai, drop the sea anchor.
- Yes, sir.

533
01:04:01,421 --> 01:04:03,298
Something's coming this way.

534
01:04:29,783 --> 01:04:32,660
I just saw the Goddess of Mercy!

535
01:04:32,744 --> 01:04:34,037
Ah!

536
01:04:43,338 --> 01:04:45,840
- The engine's working.
- It was her.

537
01:04:45,924 --> 01:04:49,094
So you saw her, too?
I thought maybe I was hallucinating.

538
01:04:49,177 --> 01:04:52,013
Thank you for protecting us…

539
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:22,961
Higher, higher.

540
01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:29,259
Huh?!

541
01:05:34,722 --> 01:05:37,851
That has a powerful spell on it.

542
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:40,228
How has she learned
to do something like that?

543
01:05:57,162 --> 01:05:59,664
What? I can't believe it! No!

544
01:05:59,747 --> 01:06:03,585
She's turned into a human!
Whoa! Hold still!

545
01:06:03,668 --> 01:06:07,005
You… What are you doing?

546
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:12,677
Hold still!

547
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:15,388
Girls! Girls… Whoa!

548
01:06:15,472 --> 01:06:18,391
Stop, stop! Please!

549
01:06:18,475 --> 01:06:20,852
Stop now! No! Stop! Ah!

550
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:23,229
Respect your father!

551
01:06:27,775 --> 01:06:30,862
This was serious.
I'm trying to save your sister.

552
01:06:36,201 --> 01:06:39,245
At last, she has finally come.

553
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:20,328
- Fujimoto.
- It's been a long time, my love.

554
01:07:20,411 --> 01:07:22,705
Look at my ocean.

555
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:27,627
Something has changed.

556
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:31,256
It's like my ancient Devonian Sea,
full of magic and power.

557
01:07:31,339 --> 01:07:33,967
You're going to be very upset, my dear.

558
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:37,303
Ponyo got into my elixirs,
and she has tasted human blood.

559
01:07:37,387 --> 01:07:42,392
Ponyo? What a lovely name.

560
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:47,313
Hm.

561
01:07:47,397 --> 01:07:49,315
Of course, it's all my fault, really.

562
01:07:49,399 --> 01:07:51,276
She's become so powerful

563
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:54,445
that she's opened a hole
in the fabric of reality.

564
01:07:54,529 --> 01:07:57,156
She's too young to understand,
and she wouldn't listen to me.

565
01:07:57,240 --> 01:08:00,827
She's now a little girl.
And she loves a little boy.

566
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:02,954
And the whole world is out of balance.

567
01:08:03,037 --> 01:08:07,500
Please, please, remove the human
in her, or the planet is doomed.

568
01:08:07,584 --> 01:08:10,253
Huh?

569
01:08:16,134 --> 01:08:19,345
Already the Earth
is pulling satellites from the sky.

570
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:22,015
And the moon pulls the sea closer…

571
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:25,101
Be calm, dear.

572
01:08:32,025 --> 01:08:36,070
Sosuke. The boy's name is Sosuke.

573
01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:43,453
We love your sister,
and we all want her to be happy.

574
01:08:46,581 --> 01:08:50,752
Listen, my darling, why don't we
let Ponyo become human for good?

575
01:08:50,835 --> 01:08:53,880
We must test the boy.
If Sosuke's love is true,

576
01:08:53,963 --> 01:08:56,132
Ponyo will be permanently transformed

577
01:08:56,215 --> 01:08:58,217
and the balance of nature
will be restored.

578
01:08:58,301 --> 01:09:02,555
But if his love isn't real,
then Ponyo will turn into sea foam.

579
01:09:02,639 --> 01:09:06,768
True. That is where
we all originated, my darling.

580
01:09:06,851 --> 01:09:09,020
The boy is so young, so innocent.

581
01:09:09,103 --> 01:09:11,481
- What does…?
- Shh.

582
01:09:15,234 --> 01:09:17,445
Let them sleep.

583
01:09:17,528 --> 01:09:19,447
They'll need their rest.

584
01:09:31,292 --> 01:09:33,002
Sosuke!

585
01:09:34,629 --> 01:09:38,341
Sosuke!

586
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:42,762
Ponyo, you OK?

587
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:45,890
Good morning, Sosuke.

588
01:09:48,893 --> 01:09:51,437
Huh?

589
01:09:51,521 --> 01:09:54,232
Look at that. The ocean is at our door.

590
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:19,424
How come your mom's not here?

591
01:10:19,507 --> 01:10:22,844
The water's so high. She must be stuck.

592
01:10:22,927 --> 01:10:24,929
Too bad we don't have a boat.

593
01:10:27,724 --> 01:10:29,434
There's a boat, right there!

594
01:10:31,477 --> 01:10:34,605
- It's a little small.
- No, it's not.

595
01:10:41,654 --> 01:10:43,573
Ah!

596
01:10:47,326 --> 01:10:50,413
Uh! Huh?

597
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:52,165
Thank you!

598
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:56,753
Wow! You even made
the candle bigger.

599
01:10:56,836 --> 01:10:59,297
- We can fit!
- This is fantastic.

600
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:01,966
- Fantastic!
- You take that end, please.

601
01:11:02,049 --> 01:11:03,301
OK!

602
01:11:05,678 --> 01:11:08,181
- Ready?
<i>'</i> Let's

603
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:09,974
Whoa!

604
01:11:10,057 --> 01:11:13,019
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

605
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:14,979
Ah!

606
01:11:20,777 --> 01:11:24,030
It actually floats!

607
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:28,326
Doesn't look like it has any leaks.

608
01:11:28,409 --> 01:11:30,661
Now, we have to fill the boiler.

609
01:11:30,745 --> 01:11:33,831
The water gets sucked in
through this pipe.

610
01:11:33,915 --> 01:11:36,834
Then it gets heated up
here in this round thing.

611
01:12:02,485 --> 01:12:05,822
Well, that worked.

612
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:14,664
Looks like everything's shipshape.

613
01:12:14,747 --> 01:12:16,666
- Shipshape!
- Yep.

614
01:12:16,749 --> 01:12:19,085
- Shipshape!
- Shipshape.

615
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:22,588
Shipshape! Shipshape!
Shipshape! Shipshape!

616
01:12:22,672 --> 01:12:23,673
Shipshape!

617
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:47,363
What's that?

618
01:12:51,325 --> 01:12:53,369
- Ow!
- Ow!

619
01:12:57,039 --> 01:12:59,792
- Look at that!
- It's burning.

620
01:12:59,876 --> 01:13:03,212
It's hot! It's hot! It's hot! It's hot!

621
01:13:10,678 --> 01:13:13,431
- Is it working?
- Hm…

622
01:13:23,274 --> 01:13:25,443
It's working!

623
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:29,322
Sosuke, we're shipshape, right?

624
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:30,656
- Yep.
- This is a good boat.

625
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:31,741
Mm-hm.

626
01:13:35,745 --> 01:13:37,663
Ah!

627
01:13:39,165 --> 01:13:42,209
- Hey, Sosuke! Look at me!
- Mm-hm.

628
01:13:42,293 --> 01:13:45,046
- Hey, this is even more fun!
- Mm-hm.

629
01:13:45,129 --> 01:13:47,673
That thing makes my nose hot.

630
01:13:47,757 --> 01:13:50,343
Ponyo, you be the boat's lookout.

631
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:54,764
- And I'll do the steering, OK?
- Mm-hm. I'm the lookout!

632
01:14:21,332 --> 01:14:22,875
There's the road.

633
01:14:22,959 --> 01:14:25,169
That's the road my mom took last night.

634
01:14:27,630 --> 01:14:30,549
- I don't see her anywhere.
- We'll see her.

635
01:14:30,633 --> 01:14:32,969
She promised me she'd come back.

636
01:14:37,515 --> 01:14:41,185
Those are ancient fish.
They lived during the Devonian Age.

637
01:14:41,268 --> 01:14:44,814
I know that one. It's Bothriocephalus.

638
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:50,611
- And that one is…
- Dipnorhynchus.

639
01:14:50,695 --> 01:14:52,405
Dipnorhynchus!

640
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:55,199
Wow! That one's really huge!

641
01:14:55,282 --> 01:14:58,327
- That's Devonynchus!
- Devonynchus!

642
01:15:05,001 --> 01:15:07,336
Ahoy!

643
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:10,089
Ahoy!

644
01:15:10,172 --> 01:15:12,091
- Ahoy…
- Whoa, there's a boat!

645
01:15:12,842 --> 01:15:14,844
Ahoy!

646
01:15:16,137 --> 01:15:18,639
I'm gonna say that.

647
01:15:18,723 --> 01:15:20,891
Ahoy!

648
01:15:22,643 --> 01:15:24,103
Ow!

649
01:15:26,022 --> 01:15:28,107
Whoa, that's fast!

650
01:15:30,026 --> 01:15:32,528
- Hey!
- I'm getting the hang of this.

651
01:15:36,073 --> 01:15:37,867
Get ready to stop, Ponyo.

652
01:15:43,998 --> 01:15:46,125
- Hello, you two.
- Hello.

653
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:49,128
Hey, that is quite a boat you got there.

654
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:52,256
I've seen you before.
You're Lisa's little boy, aren't you?

655
01:15:52,339 --> 01:15:55,134
He's not a little boy. He's Sosuke!

656
01:15:55,217 --> 01:15:56,719
She's Ponyo.

657
01:15:57,636 --> 01:15:59,847
And I used to be a fish.

658
01:15:59,930 --> 01:16:02,475
Is that right?

659
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:04,351
I like your name, Ponyo. It's cute.

660
01:16:04,435 --> 01:16:06,562
Mm-hm.

661
01:16:06,645 --> 01:16:08,981
By the way, have you seen my mom?

662
01:16:09,065 --> 01:16:12,485
Your mother?
Why isn't your mother with you?

663
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:15,529
- She went to the senior center.
- Wow, way up there?

664
01:16:15,613 --> 01:16:17,448
My baby likes you.

665
01:16:44,975 --> 01:16:49,021
Oh, sweetheart.

666
01:16:55,611 --> 01:16:58,030
Oh, is that for us?

667
01:17:11,127 --> 01:17:13,337
Can I have the cup?

668
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:21,220
Well, thank you. It smells good.

669
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:27,017
Wow, that's good soup. Thanks.

670
01:17:27,101 --> 01:17:31,272
- My mom made it from scratch.
- The soup's for him!

671
01:17:31,355 --> 01:17:35,067
Oh, I'm sorry. He's a little too young.

672
01:17:35,151 --> 01:17:37,278
He can only drink milk at this age.

673
01:17:37,361 --> 01:17:38,988
But I could eat the soup instead,

674
01:17:39,071 --> 01:17:41,282
and it would help me
to make milk for him.

675
01:17:41,365 --> 01:17:43,200
Huh?

676
01:17:43,284 --> 01:17:45,786
Yeah, my mom made milk for me, too.

677
01:17:45,870 --> 01:17:50,416
Ponyo, what do you say?
Is it all right if I eat the soup?

678
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:52,918
- That's fine.
- Thank you, sweetheart.

679
01:17:53,002 --> 01:17:56,672
Huh?

680
01:18:10,436 --> 01:18:14,315
People from the town!
It's just like a parade!

681
01:18:14,398 --> 01:18:19,236
Ahoy! Are any of you
in need of assistance at this time?

682
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:24,450
We're all good here!
But thanks for checking on us, captain!

683
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:27,870
We are taking everyone
to the Mountain Peak Hotel!

684
01:18:27,953 --> 01:18:30,706
For your safety,
we request that you follow us!

685
01:18:30,789 --> 01:18:33,459
Aye, aye! Will do!

686
01:18:35,336 --> 01:18:36,962
Looks like
the whole town is here.

687
01:18:37,046 --> 01:18:38,130
I don't see your mom.

688
01:18:38,214 --> 01:18:41,258
- I hope she's OK.
- Ponyo, time for us to cast off.

689
01:18:41,342 --> 01:18:42,384
Hold on a second.

690
01:18:49,058 --> 01:18:53,187
- Here, have some milk.
- Oh. Uh…

691
01:18:53,270 --> 01:18:54,313
It's for milk.

692
01:18:54,396 --> 01:18:57,149
She already ate all the ham
off those sandwiches.

693
01:18:57,233 --> 01:19:00,152
Thank you.
That's very generous of you, Ponyo.

694
01:19:00,236 --> 01:19:01,987
Sosuke, here.

695
01:19:02,071 --> 01:19:04,156
I brought you the biggest candle I have.

696
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:07,243
Thanks. Ponyo will make it bigger.

697
01:19:07,326 --> 01:19:09,954
- See you later.
- Take care.

698
01:19:10,037 --> 01:19:12,122
Be careful.

699
01:19:15,626 --> 01:19:19,296
Oh! What's the matter?

700
01:19:23,509 --> 01:19:27,179
Shh, shh, shh. You have a cold.

701
01:19:44,446 --> 01:19:46,115
Ponyo!

702
01:19:58,919 --> 01:20:00,754
Hey, are you guys OK?

703
01:20:00,838 --> 01:20:02,298
Hey, Sosuke.

704
01:20:02,381 --> 01:20:05,301
- What are you doing out here?
- Sosuke, where's your mother?

705
01:20:05,384 --> 01:20:07,386
She went
to the senior center last night!

706
01:20:07,469 --> 01:20:08,679
We're on our way to find her!

707
01:20:08,762 --> 01:20:12,016
You know, I still can't believe
Lisa beat that wave.

708
01:20:12,099 --> 01:20:15,394
- That's Lisa.
- Sosuke, can I ride with you?

709
01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:18,480
I can't. I'm busy.
I have a job to do now.

710
01:20:18,564 --> 01:20:22,151
Check the park.
The seniors should be there by now.

711
01:20:22,234 --> 01:20:24,570
- Good luck, kid!
- You'll find her!

712
01:20:24,653 --> 01:20:29,199
We'll send a boat for the seniors
as soon as we drop this group off!

713
01:20:29,283 --> 01:20:33,162
Good luck, captain!

714
01:21:20,084 --> 01:21:23,712
Ponyo, our candle is just about out.

715
01:21:26,673 --> 01:21:30,719
We'll be OK.
The fisherman gave me another one.

716
01:21:30,803 --> 01:21:34,139
Ow! It's still pretty hot.

717
01:21:38,727 --> 01:21:41,647
Bye-bye.

718
01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:44,900
Here, Ponyo. Can you make this bigger?

719
01:21:45,943 --> 01:21:47,861
All right.

720
01:21:52,991 --> 01:21:55,869
Hey, are you OK?

721
01:21:55,953 --> 01:21:57,746
Hm?

722
01:22:02,751 --> 01:22:05,504
- Ponyo.
- Hm?

723
01:22:20,269 --> 01:22:21,895
Ponyo. Ponyo!

724
01:23:19,328 --> 01:23:22,164
Oh, good. I can walk from here.

725
01:23:48,815 --> 01:23:50,275
There's the road.

726
01:24:01,537 --> 01:24:04,706
It's shrinking!

727
01:24:05,707 --> 01:24:07,042
Ponyo!

728
01:24:26,687 --> 01:24:28,063
Ponyo!

729
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:31,191
Ponyo, wake up!

730
01:24:33,443 --> 01:24:36,071
Sosuke.

731
01:24:41,535 --> 01:24:43,120
You scared me.

732
01:24:43,203 --> 01:24:46,248
Don't turn into a fish again.
I'd miss you.

733
01:24:58,468 --> 01:25:02,097
My mom's car! Ponyo, come on!
She might be there!

734
01:25:05,934 --> 01:25:08,520
Hey, Mom! Mom!

735
01:25:11,106 --> 01:25:12,107
Mommy!

736
01:25:16,278 --> 01:25:18,530
Mommy!

737
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:22,367
Mom!

738
01:25:26,288 --> 01:25:27,789
Mommy!

739
01:25:30,292 --> 01:25:32,336
Mom!

740
01:25:34,921 --> 01:25:36,632
Mom!

741
01:26:05,035 --> 01:26:07,746
Here, I've got your boat.

742
01:26:07,829 --> 01:26:10,540
There's water coming from your eyes.

743
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:20,467
- Let's go find your mom.
- Mm-hm.

744
01:27:06,513 --> 01:27:09,433
- It's so beautiful!
- You forgot your cane!

745
01:27:09,516 --> 01:27:11,977
Look, here comes a whale again!

746
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:13,645
I think he sees us.

747
01:27:13,729 --> 01:27:15,689
The other side is nice, isn't it?

748
01:27:15,772 --> 01:27:18,734
- And my knees don't hurt.
- This is the other side?

749
01:27:18,817 --> 01:27:22,195
Where do you think we are, Las Vegas?

750
01:27:22,279 --> 01:27:27,451
- It's like a dream.
- Ladies, can we gather around, please?

751
01:27:27,534 --> 01:27:30,996
- Coming!
- Why don't we run?

752
01:27:31,079 --> 01:27:32,831
Come on!

753
01:27:32,914 --> 01:27:36,793
- It's so nice to run.
- Beat you there!

754
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:43,383
Winner!

755
01:27:47,262 --> 01:27:49,181
Everyone, quiet, please.

756
01:27:49,264 --> 01:27:52,309
The time has come
for you to bear witness

757
01:27:52,392 --> 01:27:55,187
to a sacred test of love.

758
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:58,732
- Oh, how exciting!
- Are they too young for this?

759
01:27:58,815 --> 01:28:00,942
- Are we too old?
- When are they coming?

760
01:28:02,277 --> 01:28:04,905
Please, ladies,
the children are coming now.

761
01:28:04,988 --> 01:28:07,908
And remember,
this is a very important moment.

762
01:28:07,991 --> 01:28:10,285
A crucial moment.

763
01:28:10,368 --> 01:28:14,706
Fujimoto, you won't let any harm
come to Sosuke or Ponyo, will you?

764
01:28:14,790 --> 01:28:17,584
It's not in his nature.

765
01:28:17,667 --> 01:28:20,337
Of course I wouldn't.

766
01:28:20,420 --> 01:28:23,799
My hope is Ponyo will stay asleep.
Excuse me.

767
01:28:32,599 --> 01:28:34,935
Do you think we can trust him?

768
01:28:35,018 --> 01:28:37,437
I wonder what Lisa is thinking.

769
01:28:37,521 --> 01:28:38,897
She's with that woman,

770
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:42,359
and they've been talking
all night and day.

771
01:28:50,367 --> 01:28:52,953
Poor Lisa. Must be hard on her.

772
01:28:53,036 --> 01:28:55,914
I wish we could hear
what they're talking about.

773
01:28:55,997 --> 01:28:58,458
Oh, why don't we just ask. Lisa!

774
01:28:58,542 --> 01:29:01,878
Lisa!

775
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:08,593
Lisa!

776
01:29:08,677 --> 01:29:11,388
We wanna know
what you're talking about!

777
01:29:11,471 --> 01:29:12,764
Come tell us!

778
01:29:27,362 --> 01:29:29,072
- My dear!
- Lisa!

779
01:29:29,155 --> 01:29:30,240
What's going on?

780
01:29:30,323 --> 01:29:32,701
Lisa, are you sure
you can trust that man?

781
01:29:32,784 --> 01:29:33,952
It's so exciting.

782
01:29:34,035 --> 01:29:36,037
Tell us what's going to happen next.

783
01:29:36,121 --> 01:29:38,832
Whatever happens,
I'm just glad you're all here for this.

784
01:29:38,915 --> 01:29:41,877
It's going to be fine.

785
01:30:06,067 --> 01:30:08,320
I think I've been here before.

786
01:30:08,403 --> 01:30:10,947
Ponyo?

787
01:30:11,031 --> 01:30:13,199
Don't like this place.

788
01:30:17,078 --> 01:30:19,456
Don't let go of my hand.

789
01:30:19,539 --> 01:30:21,166
Mm…

790
01:30:57,077 --> 01:30:59,037
Ponyo!

791
01:31:17,555 --> 01:31:18,556
Ponyo!

792
01:31:26,731 --> 01:31:27,816
Ponyo!

793
01:31:49,671 --> 01:31:52,090
Ponyo! Please don't die!

794
01:31:52,173 --> 01:31:54,759
Ponyo!

795
01:31:54,843 --> 01:31:58,596
- Ponyo, wake up!
- Shh.

796
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:00,765
Be careful not to wake her.

797
01:32:00,849 --> 01:32:04,978
It's good to meet you, Sosuke.
We've all been waiting for you.

798
01:32:05,061 --> 01:32:08,773
- The old ladies, your mother…
- My mother?

799
01:32:08,857 --> 01:32:12,402
Won't you come with me
and join them, Sosuke? Ponyo, too.

800
01:32:12,485 --> 01:32:14,446
Come with me.

801
01:32:14,529 --> 01:32:17,657
I promise I'm not
going to take Ponyo away from you.

802
01:32:17,741 --> 01:32:20,452
- We have to go now.
- Sosuke!

803
01:32:20,535 --> 01:32:23,455
Sosuke, don't listen to that wacko!

804
01:32:23,538 --> 01:32:26,124
He tricked all the others
into going with him,

805
01:32:26,207 --> 01:32:28,334
- but he couldn't fool me!
- Toki!

806
01:32:28,418 --> 01:32:30,336
Did you hear me? Nobody fools me!

807
01:32:30,420 --> 01:32:34,632
There is so little time!
My choice has to be made!

808
01:32:34,716 --> 01:32:37,802
If the moon comes any closer…
Can't you see it?

809
01:32:37,886 --> 01:32:40,346
The world is out of balance!
We will all be underwater!

810
01:32:40,430 --> 01:32:43,725
That's the best excuse you can
come up with? A falling moon?

811
01:32:43,808 --> 01:32:46,644
- Humans!
- Sosuke, come to me!

812
01:32:46,728 --> 01:32:48,772
Sosuke, please listen.
You have to trust me.

813
01:32:48,855 --> 01:32:52,400
You're the only one who can
save the planet. Do it now. Do it!

814
01:32:53,359 --> 01:32:55,236
Ponyo!

815
01:32:56,905 --> 01:32:59,240
Brunhilde, respect your father!

816
01:33:05,622 --> 01:33:07,290
Ponyo!

817
01:33:07,373 --> 01:33:10,126
Sosuke, come on!

818
01:33:10,210 --> 01:33:12,212
Bring them to me!

819
01:33:17,383 --> 01:33:19,177
Faster!

820
01:33:21,221 --> 01:33:22,639
Jump for it!

821
01:34:02,303 --> 01:34:03,304
Now what?

822
01:34:58,276 --> 01:35:00,612
- Mama!
- Sosuke.

823
01:35:00,695 --> 01:35:02,405
Ponyo!

824
01:35:06,868 --> 01:35:09,454
You don't have to swim.

825
01:35:09,537 --> 01:35:11,581
I don't know why we're here.

826
01:35:20,715 --> 01:35:24,510
- So this is Sosuke.
- How do you do?

827
01:35:24,594 --> 01:35:27,639
- Are you Ponyo's mother?
- Yes.

828
01:35:27,722 --> 01:35:30,308
You brought my daughter safely here.

829
01:35:30,391 --> 01:35:32,644
- Shh!
- Thank you.

830
01:35:32,727 --> 01:35:36,272
Sosuke, Ponyo opened a magic well

831
01:35:36,356 --> 01:35:41,569
because she wants very much
to be human, to become a real girl.

832
01:35:41,653 --> 01:35:46,783
She needs you to accept
and love her as she truly is.

833
01:35:46,866 --> 01:35:51,329
You know that Ponyo was a fish,
don't you?

834
01:35:51,412 --> 01:35:52,664
Mm-hm.

835
01:35:52,747 --> 01:35:54,707
And you know her as a human.

836
01:35:54,791 --> 01:35:57,961
- Your drop of blood did that.
- Oh, that's it!

837
01:35:58,044 --> 01:36:01,297
I cut my thumb.
Then Ponyo licked it and made it better.

838
01:36:01,381 --> 01:36:03,883
So that's how she changed into a human.

839
01:36:03,967 --> 01:36:08,680
Could you love her
if she moved between two worlds?

840
01:36:08,763 --> 01:36:11,349
Mm-hm. I love all the Ponyos.

841
01:36:11,432 --> 01:36:16,062
It's a big responsibility,
but I really love her.

842
01:36:25,488 --> 01:36:28,366
Ooh!

843
01:36:29,784 --> 01:36:32,078
Ponyo, come here, please.

844
01:36:46,301 --> 01:36:51,139
Ponyo, Sosuke has promised
to accept you as you are.

845
01:36:53,683 --> 01:36:57,603
To become human,
you must choose to abandon magic.

846
01:36:57,687 --> 01:37:01,149
- Can you do that?
- Mm-hm.

847
01:37:10,158 --> 01:37:13,328
Kiss the bubble, child,
when you return to land,

848
01:37:13,411 --> 01:37:17,665
and Ponyo will become a girl,
growing up just like you.

849
01:37:21,169 --> 01:37:23,588
I accept, Ponyo.

850
01:37:23,671 --> 01:37:26,966
Thank you very much, Ponyo's mother.

851
01:37:32,513 --> 01:37:35,516
Everyone,
the balance of nature is restored.

852
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:38,686
Life begins again.

853
01:37:39,479 --> 01:37:41,439
I'm so proud!

854
01:37:47,070 --> 01:37:49,113
My Sosuke.

855
01:38:13,554 --> 01:38:16,349
- Good luck, Lisa.
- Thank you.

856
01:38:16,432 --> 01:38:18,226
I'll take care of her.

857
01:38:29,445 --> 01:38:32,532
There you are! Are you all right?

858
01:38:37,870 --> 01:38:39,997
Wait, let me get your wheelchairs!

859
01:38:40,081 --> 01:38:42,208
Don't bother, Shima-san.
We like to walk.

860
01:38:42,291 --> 01:38:44,460
Life begins again.

861
01:38:47,713 --> 01:38:49,715
This is yours, I believe.

862
01:38:52,176 --> 01:38:55,680
- Thank you.
- Try to remember me kindly.

863
01:38:55,763 --> 01:38:57,765
If you will. May I?

864
01:39:03,438 --> 01:39:05,440
Take care of Ponyo.

865
01:39:06,607 --> 01:39:09,068
It's your father!

866
01:39:13,531 --> 01:39:17,452
Koichi! Hi!

867
01:39:17,535 --> 01:39:19,203
Over here!

868
01:39:19,287 --> 01:39:22,957
Ah! Lisa and Sosuke!

869
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:24,750
Ahoy!

870
01:39:24,834 --> 01:39:28,045
Look, Ponyo, there's my dad's ship!
