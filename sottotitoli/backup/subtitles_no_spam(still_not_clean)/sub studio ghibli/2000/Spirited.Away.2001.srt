1
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:21,021
GOOD LUCK, CHIHIRO
WE'LL MEET AGAIN

2
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:24,024
Chihiro. Chihiro!

3
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:25,692
We're almost there.

4
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:30,531
This really is the middle of nowhere.

5
00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:33,450
I'll have to shop in the next town.

6
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:35,994
It'll be great, once we get used to it.

7
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:40,040
Look, there's the school.

8
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:41,833
That's your new school, Chihiro.

9
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:45,045
It doesn't look so bad.

10
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:54,888
I liked my old school...

11
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:01,853
Mommy... My flowers died.

12
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:04,731
No wonder, the way you clung to them.

13
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:07,734
A little water when we get there
and they'll perk right up.

14
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:12,406
My very first bouquet
is farewell flowers, how sad.

15
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:15,867
What about that rose
you got for your birthday.

16
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:19,162
One rose isn't a bouquet.

17
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:20,914
You dropped your card.

18
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:22,457
I'm opening the window.

19
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:25,669
C'mon now, behave yourself.
It's a big day for all of us.

20
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:04,750
Hey... Did I take the wrong turn?

21
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:08,128
I don't get it.

22
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,297
That must be it, look.

23
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:13,091
It must be that blue one over there.

24
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:14,926
That's it.

25
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:16,928
I must've missed the exit.

26
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,223
I bet this road'll get us there.

27
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:22,851
This is always how you get us lost.

28
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,895
Just a little farther, OK.

29
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,147
What are those little houses?

30
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,899
They're shrines. People pray to them.

31
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:37,491
Daddy, are we lost?

32
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:40,202
We're fine, we've got four-wheel drive.

33
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:42,037
Sit down, Chihiro.

34
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:04,518
You're going to kill us.

35
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:07,562
A tunnel.

36
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:23,703
What's this strange building?

37
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:25,956
Must be the entrance.

38
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:27,165
Honey...

39
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:29,876
Let's go back, honey.

40
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,753
Chihiro.

41
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:34,005
No...

42
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:36,967
It's just plaster.

43
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,302
This building's pretty new.

44
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:50,480
The wind's going in.

45
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:52,232
What is it?

46
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,484
Let's have a look. There's a way through.

47
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:57,237
It's creepy, Daddy, let's go back.

48
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:00,115
No need to be scared.

49
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,992
Just a little farther, OK?

50
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,994
The moving van'll get there before us.

51
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:08,331
So, let 'em, they've got the keys.
Let the movers move us.

52
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:09,458
I know, but...

53
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,418
No! I won't go.

54
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,714
Daddy, let's go back.

55
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,048
Nothing to be scared of.

56
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,176
I won't go.

57
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,853
Chihiro, you wait in the car.

58
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,690
Mommy.

59
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:36,777
Wait.

60
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,117
Watch your step.

61
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:47,412
You'll make me trip, Chihiro,
clinging like that.

62
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:20,570
Where are we?

63
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,864
Say, do you hear that?

64
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:32,666
It's a train.

65
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,584
Maybe we're near the station.

66
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,545
Let's go and find out.

67
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,542
What are those houses doing here?

68
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,127
I knew it.

69
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:20,380
This must be an abandoned theme park.

70
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:25,635
They built so many in the early '90s,

71
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:28,221
but they all went down with the economy.

72
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:30,932
This must be one of 'em.

73
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:33,059
What! No.

74
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:35,729
Let's go back, Daddy.

75
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,358
C'mon.

76
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:53,079
Mommy, that building's moaning.

77
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:54,122
It's just the wind.

78
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:56,583
What a lovely spot.

79
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,127
We should've brought our lunch with us.

80
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,174
They were making a river.

81
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,222
Hey, you smell that?

82
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:14,017
See, it smells great.

83
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,226
You're right.

84
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:18,063
Maybe they're still open.

85
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:19,856
Hurry up, Chihiro.

86
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,983
Wait for me.

87
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,601
This way.

88
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:04,234
Can you believe it,
they're all restaurants.

89
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,403
Where is everybody?

90
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:10,448
Over there.

91
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,788
Hey.

92
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,509
In here.

93
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,347
How amazing!

94
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:37,350
Hello, anybody here?

95
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:39,894
Come in, Chihiro, it looks delicious.

96
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,229
Hello!

97
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:49,863
Oh, don't worry.
We can pay them when they get back.

98
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:52,532
You're right. That one looks great...

99
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,868
I wonder what this is called.

100
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:59,247
Delicious! Chihiro, taste it.

101
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:01,124
I don't want to.

102
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,877
Let's go! They're gonna be mad at us.

103
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:07,464
Don't worry, you've got Daddy here.

104
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,591
I've got credit cards and cash.

105
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,473
Take some, Chihiro, it's so tender.

106
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:19,142
Mustard.

107
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:19,976
Thank you.

108
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,490
Mommy! Daddy!

109
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:06,564
OIL

110
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:22,247
OIL

111
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:40,348
OIL

112
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,269
Weird...

113
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,402
OIL

114
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:04,789
BATHHOUSE

115
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:15,925
There's a train.

116
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,271
You're not allowed here. Go back.

117
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:29,355
Wha--

118
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:32,275
It's almost night!
Leave before it gets dark.

119
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,027
BATHHOUSE

120
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:37,196
They're lighting the lamps. Go.

121
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,782
I'll distract them.
Get back across the river.

122
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:45,413
OIL

123
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,215
What's his problem?

124
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:05,850
Daddy.

125
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,645
Daddy, let's go home.

126
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,355
Let's go, Daddy.

127
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:40,176
Daddy! Mommy!

128
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,729
Mommy!

129
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,086
It's water.

130
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,517
This can't be...

131
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,394
I'm dreaming, dreaming.

132
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,149
Wake up!

133
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:39,277
Wake... up...

134
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:46,993
It's just a dream, a dream.

135
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:50,121
Go away, disappear.

136
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:51,539
Disappear.

137
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,424
I can see through.

138
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:06,637
It's a dream, it's got to be.

139
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,651
Don't be afraid, I'm a friend.

140
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:03,820
No, no, no.

141
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:05,947
Open your mouth and eat this.

142
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:09,158
Unless you eat something from this world,
you'll vanish.

143
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:10,410
No!

144
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:15,373
Don't worry.

145
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,792
It won't turn you into a pig.

146
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,585
Chew it and swallow.

147
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,889
Good girl, you're fine.

148
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:33,433
See for yourself.

149
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:42,900
I'm back again...

150
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:45,236
You see? Now come.

151
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:49,365
What about my mom and dad? They
didn't really turn into pigs, did they?

152
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:52,201
You can't see them now, but you will.

153
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:56,414
Quiet.

154
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,058
It's looking for you.

155
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:18,227
There's no time, let's run.

156
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,647
I... I can't stand! Oh, no.

157
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:23,149
My legs don't work.

158
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:25,735
Calm, now. Take a deep breath.

159
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:33,493
In the name of the wind and the water
within thee... Unbind her.

160
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:34,785
Get up.

161
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,712
NO ENTRY

162
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:09,028
OIL

163
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:20,164
Hold your breath
while we're on the bridge.

164
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:23,501
Even a tiny breath

165
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:26,629
will break the spell
and the attendants will see you.

166
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:33,177
I'm scared.

167
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:34,762
Be calm.

168
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:38,015
Welcome. Always nice to see you.

169
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:40,268
Welcome.

170
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:41,936
I'm back from my task.

171
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,771
Welcome back, sir.

172
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:46,816
A deep breath...

173
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:49,068
And hold...

174
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:09,672
Welcome back! We missed you!

175
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:12,758
Hang on, we're almost...

176
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:15,261
Master Haku.

177
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,638
Where have you...

178
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,850
Wha... A human.

179
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:22,977
Run.

180
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,647
What...

181
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,912
Master Haku!

182
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:44,665
Chase after it. A human intruder.

183
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,084
I smell humans! The stench of humans.

184
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:48,169
They know you're here.

185
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,920
I'm sorry, I took a breath.

186
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:52,048
No, Chihiro, you did very well.

187
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:55,051
Listen and I'll tell you what to do.

188
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,552
Stay here, and they'll find you.

189
00:18:57,261 --> 00:19:00,598
I'll distract them.
In the meantime, you escape.

190
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:03,059
No, don't go! Stay with me, please.

191
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:06,896
You have no choice,
if you want to survive here.

192
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,564
And save your parents, too.

193
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:12,443
So they did turn into pigs...
I wasn't dreaming...

194
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:13,903
Be still...

195
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:18,282
When things quiet down,
go out by the back gate.

196
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:21,118
Take the stairs, all the way down.

197
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:24,914
Until you reach the boiler room,
where they stoke the fires.

198
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:27,667
Kamaji's there, so look for him.

199
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,210
Ask him for work.

200
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:30,044
Kamaji?

201
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,798
Even if he refuses, insist.

202
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,299
If you don't work,

203
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:39,303
Yubaba will turn you into an animal.

204
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:41,138
Yubaba.

205
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:43,808
You'll see.
She's the sorceress who rules our world.

206
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:47,561
Kamaji will turn you away,
trick you into you leaving,

207
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:49,063
but keep on asking him for work.

208
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,982
It'll be hard work,
but it will give you a chance.

209
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:54,110
Then even Yubaba can't harm you.

210
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,069
OK.

211
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,072
Master Haku.

212
00:19:58,406 --> 00:19:59,615
I have to go.

213
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:02,326
Remember, Chihiro. I'm your friend.

214
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:03,828
How do you know my name?

215
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:06,330
I've known you since you were small.

216
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:08,833
My name is Haku.

217
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:13,087
Here I am!

218
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:17,591
Master Haku, Yubaba wants you.

219
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:20,720
I know. It's about my task.

220
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,719
Um...

221
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:33,263
Excuse me.

222
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,730
Um...

223
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:50,239
Um, are you Kamaji?

224
00:24:57,955 --> 00:25:01,583
Um, Haku sent me here.
Please let me work here.

225
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:09,508
Darn, all at once...

226
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:12,344
Get to work, you little runts.

227
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:16,140
I'm... Kamaji.

228
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:19,017
Slave to the boilers that heat the baths.

229
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:21,437
Step on it, boys.

230
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:24,356
Um, please let me work here.

231
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:28,819
I've got all the help I need.
The place is full of soot.

232
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:31,780
Plenty of replacements.

233
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:48,297
Oh, I'm sorry.

234
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:54,052
Please wait.

235
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:07,357
Outta the way.

236
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,704
Um... What should I do with this?

237
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:11,004
Do I just leave it?

238
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:13,507
Finish what you start.

239
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:17,154
Hey, you runts! Wanna turn back into soot?

240
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:20,949
And you, watch it.
You can't just take someone's job.

241
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:24,453
If they don't work, the spell wears off.

242
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:27,706
Got no work for you here. Look elsewhere.

243
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:39,468
You sootballs got a problem?

244
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:40,928
Get to work! To work.

245
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:43,972
Chow time.

246
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:46,391
What? You guys at it again.

247
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:50,103
Cut it out.

248
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:51,438
Where's your bowl?

249
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:54,274
I keep telling you to leave it out.

250
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:56,818
Meal time! Take a break!

251
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:14,670
A human! You're in trouble.

252
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,256
They're having a fit about it upstairs.

253
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:20,008
That's my granddaughter.

254
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:21,510
Granddaughter?

255
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:26,181
Says she wants to work,
but I've got all the help I need.

256
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:29,893
Would you take her to Yubaba?

257
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:31,645
The girl can handle her, I'm sure.

258
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:34,398
Not a chance! And risk my life?

259
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:37,484
Take this, then. A roasted newt.

260
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,528
Real quality.

261
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:45,284
If you want to work,
you'll have to make a deal with Yubaba.

262
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:47,536
Might as well try your luck.

263
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:51,540
Fine! You there, follow me.

264
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:00,632
Can't you even manage
a "Yes ma'am," or "Thank you"?

265
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:01,967
Yes... yes ma'am.

266
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,677
You sure are slow. Hurry.

267
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,886
Yes ma'am.

268
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:10,767
What do you need shoes for! Or socks!

269
00:30:16,857 --> 00:30:19,151
Did you even thank Kamaji?

270
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:21,069
He's looking out for you.

271
00:30:23,113 --> 00:30:25,032
Thank you very much, sir.

272
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:27,868
Good luck.

273
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:40,756
Yubaba lives way up at the top,
in the back.

274
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,481
Get over here.

275
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:03,820
You wanna lose your nose?

276
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:29,805
We're almost there.

277
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,014
Right.

278
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:36,311
Here we are.

279
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,024
Wel... welcome.

280
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:51,785
This elevator is not in service, sir.
Please use another.

281
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:55,163
DOWN ONLY

282
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:17,102
-He's following us...
-Quit gawking.

283
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,523
UP

284
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,494
Here we are.

285
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:41,501
Your room is on the right.

286
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:44,713
Lin.

287
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:46,965
Yes.

288
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,302
What's that smell?

289
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,888
It's human. You reek of human.

290
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:53,722
Is that so?

291
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:57,976
I smell it, I do.
Smells mighty tasty, too.

292
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:00,979
You're hiding something.

293
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:03,482
Tell me the truth, now.

294
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:04,483
This smell.

295
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:07,402
Roasted... Gimme.

296
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:10,614
Not a chance. It's for the other girls.

297
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:14,117
I'm begging you. I'll settle for a leg.

298
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,871
Anyone going up, pull down on the lever.

299
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:43,396
SECOND SKY

300
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:08,547
SKY

301
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:47,002
OIL

302
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:05,228
Not going to knock?

303
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:08,982
What a pathetic little girl.

304
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:21,244
Come closer...

305
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:26,625
I said closer.

306
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:43,600
Ow...

307
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:56,571
You're making a racket. Keep it down.

308
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,716
Um...

309
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:19,219
Please let me work here.

310
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:31,189
Stop babbling.

311
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:34,192
You're just a useless weakling.

312
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:39,030
Besides, this is no place for humans.

313
00:36:40,115 --> 00:36:42,575
It's a bath house,

314
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:46,579
where eight million spirits
can rest their weary bones.

315
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:50,667
Your parents had some nerve.

316
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:54,087
Gobbling up our guests' food like pigs!

317
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,589
Just desserts, I'd say.

318
00:36:57,048 --> 00:37:00,051
And you'll never see...

319
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:02,512
your world again either.

320
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,893
You'd make a lovely piglet.

321
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,855
Or maybe a lump of coal.

322
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,531
I see you're trembling.

323
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:25,410
Actually,
I'm impressed you made it this far.

324
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:28,371
Someone must've helped you.

325
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:31,040
I must thank your friend.

326
00:37:31,124 --> 00:37:35,503
Just who was it, my dear? You can tell me.

327
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:40,049
Please let me work here.

328
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:41,718
Not that again!

329
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:43,261
I want to work here!

330
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:47,390
Shut up!

331
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:56,232
Why should I hire you?

332
00:37:56,316 --> 00:38:00,653
Anyone can see
you're a lazy, spoiled, crybaby.

333
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:03,198
Stupid to boot.

334
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,784
I've nothing for you.

335
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:07,911
Forget it.

336
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:11,539
I've got all the bums I need around here.

337
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:16,961
Or maybe you'd like the worst,

338
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:19,130
nastiest job I've got,

339
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:24,177
until you breathe your very last breath?

340
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:39,734
Stop that! What's wrong...

341
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:43,488
I'll be right there.
That's a good baby, now.

342
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:46,241
What? You still here! Get out.

343
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:48,284
I want to work here.

344
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:50,995
Don't shout.

345
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:56,209
I'll be right there...

346
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:59,295
That's a good baby, there, there.

347
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:01,673
Please let me work!

348
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:04,843
OK, OK, just pipe down.

349
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:09,389
There, there, now.

350
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,619
Your contract.

351
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:34,581
Sign your name.

352
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,875
I'll put you to work.

353
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:40,336
But one peep out of you about anything,

354
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,630
and I'll turn you right into a piglet.

355
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:45,842
Um, I sign my name here?

356
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:49,262
That's right.
Quit dilly-dallying and do it.

357
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:56,060
Unbelievable.

358
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:59,397
That ridiculous oath I took.

359
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:04,402
To give a job to whoever asks.

360
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:08,531
-Signed it?
-Yes.

361
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:15,371
-You're Chihiro, huh?
-Yes.

362
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:18,583
What an extravagant name.

363
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,170
{\an8}CHIHIRO

364
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:23,755
{\an8}SEN

365
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:30,553
From now on, you'll be Sen.

366
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,097
You got that? You're Sen.

367
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:35,808
Answer me, Sen.

368
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,435
Yes...

369
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:38,978
Did you call?

370
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:45,068
This child's starting work as of now.
Look after her.

371
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:45,944
Yes.

372
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:47,820
Your name?

373
00:40:47,904 --> 00:40:49,030
What?

374
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,574
Chi... Oh, I'm Sen.

375
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,285
Follow me, then, Sen.

376
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:03,878
Haku... Um...

377
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,130
No idle chatter.

378
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:08,841
Call me Master Haku.

379
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:27,652
Even on Yubaba's orders...

380
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,028
We can't allow humans.

381
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:31,322
Her contract's signed.

382
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:32,115
What...

383
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:33,408
Thank you, everyone.

384
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:37,161
-Don't send her to us.
-Can't bear that human stink.

385
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:41,040
Three days of eating our food
and her smell will vanish.

386
00:41:41,124 --> 00:41:42,667
If she's still useless then,

387
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:45,753
fry her, boil her,
do with her as you will.

388
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,173
Back to work! Where's Lin?

389
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:51,676
Don't dump her on me.

390
00:41:52,427 --> 00:41:53,845
You wanted help?

391
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:57,056
That's right, Lin's just perfect.

392
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:59,267
-Go, Sen.
-Yes, Sir.

393
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:03,271
What a pain. You're gonna pay for this.

394
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:05,398
Off you go.

395
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:09,318
C'mon.

396
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:19,412
So you pulled it off, huh?

397
00:42:20,288 --> 00:42:22,165
You're so thick, I was worried.

398
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:26,502
Keep your wits, now.
If you need something, ask me, OK?

399
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:29,672
What's wrong?

400
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:32,675
I'm dizzy.

401
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,515
So this is our room.

402
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,894
A little food and some sleep
and you'll be fine.

403
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:48,900
You wash your own apron! Pants.

404
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:52,028
You're so puny.

405
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:54,197
Too big...

406
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,867
Um, Lin...

407
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:58,951
What?

408
00:42:59,035 --> 00:43:00,912
Are there two Hakus here?

409
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:02,413
Two?

410
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:05,291
Of him? I sure hope not.

411
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:06,417
Still too big.

412
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:09,045
He's Yubaba's henchman. Watch out for him.

413
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:14,884
Where the...

414
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,762
Here it is.

415
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:23,226
What's wrong? Are you OK?

416
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:26,562
What's all the fuss, Lin?

417
00:43:26,646 --> 00:43:29,190
New girl. Says she feels faint.

418
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:05,494
Meet me at the bridge.
I'll show you your mother and father.

419
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:50,373
My shoes...

420
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:05,930
Thank you.

421
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:39,588
BATHHOUSE

422
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:10,995
BATHHOUSE

423
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:16,333
Follow me.

424
00:47:59,335 --> 00:48:01,921
Daddy, Mommy, it's me.

425
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:03,672
It's Sen.

426
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:07,093
Mommy, Daddy.

427
00:48:10,054 --> 00:48:11,931
Are they sick or hurt?

428
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:14,683
No, they ate too much. Sleeping it off.

429
00:48:15,518 --> 00:48:18,437
They don't even remember being human.

430
00:48:24,068 --> 00:48:26,695
Daddy, Mommy, I promise I'll save you.

431
00:48:26,779 --> 00:48:29,907
Don't get too fat, or they'll eat you.

432
00:48:38,082 --> 00:48:39,917
Hide these.

433
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:44,380
I thought they were gone.

434
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:46,257
You'll need them to get home.

435
00:48:52,388 --> 00:48:54,890
This was a farewell card...

436
00:48:56,142 --> 00:48:57,560
Chi-hi-ro.

437
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:01,230
Chihiro... That's my name.

438
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:04,567
Yubaba rules others
by stealing their names.

439
00:49:05,401 --> 00:49:09,655
You're Sen here,
but keep your real name a secret.

440
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:12,825
She almost got mine.
I'd nearly turned into Sen.

441
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:17,121
If she steals your name,
you'll never find your way home.

442
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:20,332
I no longer remember mine.

443
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:22,334
Your real name?

444
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:26,130
But it's strange. I remembered yours.

445
00:49:28,424 --> 00:49:31,177
Go ahead, eat, you must be hungry.

446
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:32,887
I don't want to.

447
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:36,974
I put a spell on it
to give you back your strength, eat it.

448
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:16,222
You've had a hard time. Eat some more.

449
00:50:27,316 --> 00:50:29,818
OIL

450
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:32,446
Can you find your way back?

451
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:35,157
Yes, Haku, thank you. I'll work very hard.

452
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:36,533
Good.

453
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:12,588
Where were you? I was worried.

454
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,797
I'm sorry.

455
00:52:23,182 --> 00:52:24,933
Outta my way.

456
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:40,282
Is that the best you can do?

457
00:52:40,616 --> 00:52:43,118
You and Sen get the big tub as of today.

458
00:52:43,494 --> 00:52:45,537
What! But that's Frog work.

459
00:52:45,621 --> 00:52:48,624
Orders from the top.
Better give it your all.

460
00:53:08,811 --> 00:53:10,646
Aren't you... getting wet?

461
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:16,485
Hurry up, Sen!

462
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:17,903
Coming!

463
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:20,030
I'll leave this open.

464
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:49,560
-On the big tub, Lin?
-Lay off me.

465
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:56,442
Jerks! They haven't scrubbed this in ages.

466
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:14,293
This bath is reserved
for our filthiest guests.

467
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:15,878
It's caked with sludge.

468
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:18,630
Lin, Sen, first customers are here.

469
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:20,632
Right away...

470
00:54:20,716 --> 00:54:22,885
Shoot, clearly harassment.

471
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:26,138
This tub needs an herbal soak.
Get a tag from the foreman.

472
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:27,222
A tag?

473
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:33,270
-An herbal soak tag.
-Right.

474
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:36,231
What's a foreman, Lin?

475
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:43,280
Something's coming. I wonder what.

476
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:56,126
Some useless scum,
under cover of rainfall...

477
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,028
I can't waste that on you.

478
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:24,988
Why good morning!

479
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,157
Feeling refreshed?

480
00:55:27,658 --> 00:55:28,867
For Kasuga sama.

481
00:55:28,951 --> 00:55:31,245
One deluxe sulfur soak.

482
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:33,872
No point in standing there. Back to work.

483
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:36,124
Scrub with your hands.

484
00:55:36,208 --> 00:55:37,876
Good morning!

485
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:38,877
Your hands, I say.

486
00:55:38,961 --> 00:55:42,381
But... Um... It has to be an herbal soak.

487
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:44,132
You sure are dense.

488
00:55:44,216 --> 00:55:48,387
Oh... A fragrant bath coming up.
Relax and enjoy...

489
00:55:57,521 --> 00:56:00,190
Hello, foreman here. Yes, ma'am...

490
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:03,402
Thank you so much.

491
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:04,695
That's not...

492
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:06,238
Hey, you, wait.

493
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:08,699
<i>-What's the trouble?</i>
-Why, nothing at all...

494
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:10,742
We have an intruder.

495
00:56:10,826 --> 00:56:11,785
<i>Is it human?</i>

496
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:14,705
You figure it out. Haku's out today.

497
00:56:14,997 --> 00:56:17,499
Wow, you got a really good one.

498
00:56:17,583 --> 00:56:20,043
This goes to Kamaji.

499
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:23,380
Water'll be right up,
it's not too busy now.

500
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:32,514
Yank on this for hot water.

501
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:43,525
You're such a klutz.

502
00:56:43,609 --> 00:56:45,736
Look at that color!

503
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:48,030
That's the dried worm salts.

504
00:56:48,697 --> 00:56:51,700
With water this murky,
who's gonna see the sludge?

505
00:56:53,744 --> 00:56:56,580
Yank it again when it's full. It'll stop.

506
00:56:57,039 --> 00:56:58,707
Go ahead, let go.

507
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:00,417
I'll get our breakfast.

508
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:01,752
Sure.

509
00:57:24,066 --> 00:57:26,360
Ouch.

510
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:32,908
Um... The bath's not ready yet.

511
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:39,831
But, there are so many...

512
00:57:42,626 --> 00:57:44,461
Wha... They're for me?

513
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:50,092
But... I don't need this many.

514
00:57:52,928 --> 00:57:54,596
No, just one.

515
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:10,654
Madam.

516
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:12,072
It's a Stink Spirit?

517
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:14,282
An Extra Large Stinker at that.

518
00:58:14,366 --> 00:58:16,034
Headed straight for the bridge!

519
00:58:16,118 --> 00:58:18,537
Please turn back!

520
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:22,541
Please withdraw!
The bath is closed for the night.

521
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:25,419
Please withdraw, please.

522
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:28,046
Peeeee-ewy...

523
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:32,259
Something's fishy.
Didn't seem like a Stink Spirit, to me...

524
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:34,803
Well, now that it's here,
better go greet it.

525
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:39,141
Just try to get rid of it,
as fast as you can.

526
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:42,310
Please retire to your rooms!
So terribly sorry.

527
00:58:42,394 --> 00:58:43,311
Please hurry.

528
00:58:45,564 --> 00:58:47,524
Lin and Sen, Yubaba's calling.

529
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:48,316
Yes sir.

530
00:58:48,692 --> 00:58:51,278
Listen, this is your first job.

531
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:54,072
You take this customer to the big tub.

532
00:58:54,406 --> 00:58:55,115
Um...

533
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:57,075
One peep out of you and you're coal.

534
00:58:57,409 --> 00:58:58,201
Got that?

535
00:58:58,285 --> 00:59:00,245
It has arrived.

536
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:12,632
Don't insult the customer.

537
00:59:20,766 --> 00:59:24,561
Welggum to our bazzs...

538
00:59:27,606 --> 00:59:29,649
Oh... Money...

539
00:59:29,733 --> 00:59:32,319
Sen, hurry, take it.

540
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:34,029
Yes ma'am.

541
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:46,583
Zhow him de bazz.

542
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:48,460
Pl... Pleazze.

543
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:08,814
Sen!

544
01:00:12,901 --> 01:00:15,403
Awful...

545
01:00:16,488 --> 01:00:17,364
Our food...

546
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:19,574
Open the windows! All of 'em.

547
01:01:04,286 --> 01:01:05,829
What? Just a minute.

548
01:01:11,168 --> 01:01:12,335
Truly filthy.

549
01:01:12,419 --> 01:01:13,962
This is no laughing matter.

550
01:01:14,045 --> 01:01:15,547
Let's see what she does.

551
01:01:20,051 --> 01:01:22,846
Ah, she intends to re-fill the tub.

552
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:25,599
Oh, no, soiling the walls
with those filthy hands.

553
01:01:38,904 --> 01:01:40,780
Did you give Sen new tags?

554
01:01:40,864 --> 01:01:42,365
Never, what a waste!

555
01:02:24,783 --> 01:02:27,327
Oh no! All that precious herbal formula!

556
01:02:53,478 --> 01:02:55,313
Sen! Sen, where are you?

557
01:02:55,939 --> 01:02:56,856
Lin!

558
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:58,149
You OK?

559
01:02:58,233 --> 01:03:00,819
I asked Kamaji to give us
all the water he's got!

560
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:03,446
He's sending the best herbal soak ever.

561
01:03:03,989 --> 01:03:07,200
Thank you. He's got a thorn stuck in him.

562
01:03:07,284 --> 01:03:08,326
A thorn?

563
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:09,953
It's in so deep, it won't come out.

564
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:12,872
Thorn!? She said thorn?

565
01:03:14,124 --> 01:03:16,042
Rally the help downstairs.

566
01:03:16,126 --> 01:03:16,835
Step on it.

567
01:03:20,505 --> 01:03:22,048
Sen and Lin.

568
01:03:22,132 --> 01:03:24,467
That's no Stink Spirit in there.

569
01:03:26,678 --> 01:03:28,138
Grab this rope.

570
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:29,431
Yes ma'am.

571
01:03:38,189 --> 01:03:40,817
-Hold on tight!
-Yes ma'am.

572
01:03:41,276 --> 01:03:44,821
Hustle now,
and get the women to help them.

573
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:46,823
I tied it.

574
01:03:47,991 --> 01:03:51,536
Everyone, all of you! All together now.

575
01:03:51,619 --> 01:03:54,331
Heave!

576
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:56,833
And heave!

577
01:03:57,167 --> 01:03:59,336
And heave!

578
01:03:59,419 --> 01:04:01,713
And heave!

579
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:10,388
A bicycle.

580
01:04:11,056 --> 01:04:14,351
As I suspected! Now, pull!

581
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:17,187
And heave.

582
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:51,304
Sen, you OK?

583
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:04,984
Well done...

584
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:35,765
Gold! It's gold!

585
01:05:36,099 --> 01:05:38,601
Hands off! That's company property!

586
01:05:38,685 --> 01:05:42,272
Be still. Our guest is still with us.

587
01:05:48,153 --> 01:05:51,197
Sen, you're in our guest's way.
Get out and open the door.

588
01:05:51,281 --> 01:05:53,700
Open the main gates! He's leaving!

589
01:06:20,518 --> 01:06:24,647
Sen! You did great! You made us a bundle!

590
01:06:25,356 --> 01:06:27,984
That River Spirit's famous.

591
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:29,652
You can all learn from Sen.

592
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:32,697
Sake's on the house, tonight.

593
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:35,742
Now! Time to hand over
all that gold you picked up.

594
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:51,132
Want some? I swiped it.

595
01:06:51,633 --> 01:06:53,092
Thank you.

596
01:06:53,176 --> 01:06:55,345
Man, oh, man.

597
01:06:57,889 --> 01:06:59,432
I didn't see Haku.

598
01:06:59,516 --> 01:07:01,184
Not Haku again.

599
01:07:02,185 --> 01:07:04,687
He just disappears sometimes.

600
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:08,816
They say Yubaba makes him do bad stuff.

601
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:09,776
Really...

602
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:12,070
-Lights out, Lin
-Right.

603
01:07:37,595 --> 01:07:40,265
There's a town. Looks like the ocean...

604
01:07:40,557 --> 01:07:43,351
What did you expect after all that rain?

605
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:49,274
Some day, I swear I'll get to that town.
I'm gonna get out of here.

606
01:08:13,798 --> 01:08:15,341
What's wrong?

607
01:08:44,662 --> 01:08:46,164
Gold.

608
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,128
Who are you? You're no customer.

609
01:08:52,211 --> 01:08:53,796
You're not allowed in there.

610
01:09:00,511 --> 01:09:03,598
Hey! It's gold, gold! It's for me.

611
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:11,230
You can make gold.

612
01:09:16,861 --> 01:09:17,737
Gimme!

613
01:09:26,329 --> 01:09:27,664
Who goes there?

614
01:09:28,873 --> 01:09:31,167
It's way past bedtime.

615
01:09:34,712 --> 01:09:37,924
Hey boss, I'm hungry.

616
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:39,300
Starving.

617
01:09:39,384 --> 01:09:40,468
That voice...

618
01:09:40,551 --> 01:09:42,178
There, I'll pay you now.

619
01:09:43,012 --> 01:09:45,682
I'm a customer, I want a bath!

620
01:09:45,765 --> 01:09:47,308
Wake everyone up.

621
01:09:52,897 --> 01:09:56,275
Mommy, Daddy,
the River Spirit gave me this cake.

622
01:09:56,359 --> 01:09:59,362
I'm sure if you eat it,
you'll turn back into people.

623
01:10:03,366 --> 01:10:05,451
Dad, Mom, where are you?

624
01:10:05,743 --> 01:10:06,911
Dad!

625
01:10:18,089 --> 01:10:19,173
Bad dream.

626
01:10:20,758 --> 01:10:21,926
Lin...

627
01:10:26,097 --> 01:10:27,765
Where is everybody?

628
01:10:34,272 --> 01:10:37,066
Wow... it really did turn into an ocean!

629
01:10:42,405 --> 01:10:45,324
I can see where Mom and Dad are from here.

630
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:53,458
Kamaji's already lit the fires?
Did I sleep that long?

631
01:10:56,711 --> 01:10:59,630
The customer's waiting. Hurry it up!

632
01:10:59,714 --> 01:11:03,760
Serve everything you've got,
even leftovers.

633
01:11:05,803 --> 01:11:06,763
Sen!

634
01:11:06,846 --> 01:11:08,014
Lin!

635
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:10,725
I was just going to wake you up. Look.

636
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:13,227
Real gold! He gave it to me.

637
01:11:13,644 --> 01:11:15,730
This guest's a real high roller.

638
01:11:15,813 --> 01:11:18,191
Please, sir, try this.

639
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:20,109
Taste the very best.

640
01:11:23,738 --> 01:11:24,864
Throw us some gold.

641
01:11:24,947 --> 01:11:26,699
Your blessings.

642
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:30,328
I'm starving, bring it all.

643
01:11:34,957 --> 01:11:36,125
That guest...

644
01:11:36,501 --> 01:11:39,962
Come, Sen, Yubaba's still asleep.
Now's your chance!

645
01:11:40,338 --> 01:11:42,131
I'm going to see Kamaji.

646
01:11:42,799 --> 01:11:45,009
I wouldn't go right now.

647
01:11:45,092 --> 01:11:47,595
He's in a foul mood
'cause they woke him up.

648
01:11:47,678 --> 01:11:48,596
Let's go back for more, Lin.

649
01:12:14,539 --> 01:12:18,000
What if I don't recognize my parents?

650
01:12:18,668 --> 01:12:21,504
I hope Dad hasn't gotten too fat.

651
01:12:49,699 --> 01:12:51,117
The dragon I saw before!

652
01:12:51,742 --> 01:12:53,035
It's coming this way.

653
01:12:55,746 --> 01:12:57,164
What are they? Not birds!

654
01:13:08,634 --> 01:13:11,679
Fight back, Haku! This way!

655
01:13:11,762 --> 01:13:12,597
Haku?

656
01:13:13,306 --> 01:13:14,432
Haku!

657
01:13:32,617 --> 01:13:34,911
Oh... It's just paper...

658
01:14:03,272 --> 01:14:05,441
Haku? That is you, right?

659
01:14:11,614 --> 01:14:14,951
Are you hurt? Those paper birds are gone.

660
01:14:15,034 --> 01:14:16,243
You're safe, now.

661
01:14:29,507 --> 01:14:31,175
He's going to Yubaba...

662
01:14:31,842 --> 01:14:34,220
Oh, no! He'll die.

663
01:14:42,103 --> 01:14:46,565
<i>The richest man himself has come</i>

664
01:14:47,066 --> 01:14:50,820
<i>To grace us with his presence</i>

665
01:14:52,154 --> 01:14:54,240
Welcome.

666
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:57,410
<i>Time to beg for tips</i>
<i>Time to start begging</i>

667
01:14:58,202 --> 01:15:00,997
<i>Now beg</i>

668
01:15:02,748 --> 01:15:04,583
-Please, sir!
-Over here.

669
01:15:04,667 --> 01:15:06,335
Gold springs from his palms.

670
01:15:07,169 --> 01:15:10,506
Toss some this way, sir.

671
01:15:14,385 --> 01:15:15,845
What are you doing?

672
01:15:15,928 --> 01:15:16,929
I'm going upstairs.

673
01:15:17,013 --> 01:15:19,056
No, you don't. What's this?

674
01:15:19,682 --> 01:15:20,850
It's blood!

675
01:15:24,603 --> 01:15:27,023
Move, move. Let our guest through.

676
01:15:28,607 --> 01:15:30,609
Thank you for helping me before.

677
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:32,737
Don't just stand there...

678
01:15:55,134 --> 01:15:56,802
I don't want any. Don't need any.

679
01:15:59,764 --> 01:16:02,433
I'm busy, please excuse me.

680
01:16:13,778 --> 01:16:16,572
Quiet! Quiet down.

681
01:16:17,281 --> 01:16:18,949
Back, get back.

682
01:16:19,325 --> 01:16:21,452
Please forgive her manners.

683
01:16:21,535 --> 01:16:25,206
After all, the girl is only human
and new here...

684
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:30,586
Wipe that smile off your face.
I saw that look.

685
01:16:30,669 --> 01:16:31,879
Why, I would never...

686
01:16:36,801 --> 01:16:39,136
He ate them!

687
01:18:06,098 --> 01:18:07,600
Yubaba!

688
01:19:20,172 --> 01:19:23,175
We're in a fine mess, now.

689
01:19:23,467 --> 01:19:25,636
Actually, he's a No Face.

690
01:19:25,719 --> 01:19:27,638
That's right, a No Face.

691
01:19:27,972 --> 01:19:30,849
Your greed attracted
quite a guest, all right.

692
01:19:31,350 --> 01:19:34,645
Don't do anything stupid
until I get down there.

693
01:19:35,562 --> 01:19:38,941
Look, the carpet's a mess.
Get Haku out of here.

694
01:19:40,109 --> 01:19:41,944
He's no use to me now.

695
01:20:04,466 --> 01:20:07,511
Sleeping outside of your crib again.

696
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:15,769
Oh, I'm sorry,
you were sleeping like such a good baby.

697
01:20:15,853 --> 01:20:18,689
Baba still has work to do.

698
01:20:21,608 --> 01:20:24,403
Go back to sleep now. Good baby.

699
01:20:52,765 --> 01:20:54,641
Ouch, let go!

700
01:20:54,725 --> 01:20:56,643
Oh, thank you for helping me.

701
01:20:56,727 --> 01:21:00,105
But I'm in a hurry. Please let me go.

702
01:21:00,189 --> 01:21:02,775
You came here to make me sick.

703
01:21:03,067 --> 01:21:05,611
Bad germs outside, bad.

704
01:21:06,528 --> 01:21:10,366
I'm a human.
Maybe you never saw one before.

705
01:21:10,741 --> 01:21:12,993
You'll get sick out there.

706
01:21:13,077 --> 01:21:15,120
Stay here and play with me.

707
01:21:15,537 --> 01:21:16,955
Are you sick?

708
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:19,833
I'm in here 'cause I'll get sick outside.

709
01:21:19,917 --> 01:21:22,461
It's staying in here
that'll make you sick.

710
01:21:22,544 --> 01:21:26,340
You see, somebody I really care about
got hurt very badly.

711
01:21:26,423 --> 01:21:29,510
So I've got to go right now.
Please let go of my arm.

712
01:21:30,052 --> 01:21:31,428
If you go, I'll start crying.

713
01:21:31,512 --> 01:21:35,015
If I cry, Baba will come and kill you.

714
01:21:35,349 --> 01:21:36,850
I'll break your little arm.

715
01:21:36,934 --> 01:21:38,060
That hurts!

716
01:21:38,143 --> 01:21:40,646
Please, I'll come play with you later.

717
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:42,398
No, I wanna play now.

718
01:21:46,693 --> 01:21:48,612
That's blood! Get it! It's blood.

719
01:22:00,165 --> 01:22:01,959
Haku!

720
01:22:02,042 --> 01:22:04,169
Stop, go away! Scat, scat.

721
01:22:04,253 --> 01:22:05,295
Haku! It is you, right?

722
01:22:05,379 --> 01:22:06,880
Hang on.

723
01:22:07,297 --> 01:22:09,508
Be quiet! Haku!

724
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:16,265
Shoo, go away.

725
01:22:18,976 --> 01:22:20,310
Oh, no.

726
01:22:35,367 --> 01:22:39,121
I'm not afraid of blood.
I'll cry if you don't play.

727
01:22:39,204 --> 01:22:41,123
Please be a good boy and wait.

728
01:22:41,748 --> 01:22:44,543
If you don't play with me, I'll cry...

729
01:22:46,462 --> 01:22:48,005
Please, wait.

730
01:22:48,088 --> 01:22:51,341
What a racket! Simmer down.

731
01:22:52,759 --> 01:22:55,554
You're a little butterball, aren't you...

732
01:23:02,895 --> 01:23:05,189
Guess I'm still a little transparent.

733
01:23:05,272 --> 01:23:06,064
Baba.

734
01:23:06,732 --> 01:23:10,861
Oh, dear, can't you even tell me
from your own mother?

735
01:23:19,036 --> 01:23:22,831
There,
that gives you a little more freedom.

736
01:23:23,207 --> 01:23:25,167
Let's see now...
What shall we turn you into?

737
01:23:43,227 --> 01:23:45,229
This is our little secret.

738
01:23:45,312 --> 01:23:48,065
You tell anyone, I'll rip your mouth out.

739
01:23:49,608 --> 01:23:50,817
Who are you?

740
01:23:51,276 --> 01:23:53,570
Yubaba's twin sister.

741
01:23:53,654 --> 01:23:57,491
Thanks to you, I've had a good look
at this place, enjoyed myself.

742
01:23:57,574 --> 01:23:59,326
Now hand over the dragon.

743
01:23:59,409 --> 01:24:01,954
What do you want with Haku?
He's badly hurt.

744
01:24:02,621 --> 01:24:05,332
That dragon's a thief, my sister's lackey.

745
01:24:05,415 --> 01:24:08,585
Stole a precious seal from my house.

746
01:24:08,669 --> 01:24:11,463
Haku would never! He's so kind.

747
01:24:12,089 --> 01:24:15,592
All dragons are kind. Kind and stupid.

748
01:24:15,676 --> 01:24:20,222
Eager to learn my sister's magical ways.

749
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:24,476
This boy here will do anything
that greedy woman wants.

750
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:26,645
Move away.

751
01:24:26,728 --> 01:24:29,231
It's too late for him anyway.

752
01:24:29,314 --> 01:24:32,526
The seal was protected by a charm...

753
01:24:32,609 --> 01:24:34,695
Any who try to steal it must die.

754
01:24:35,404 --> 01:24:37,155
No, you can't.

755
01:24:44,663 --> 01:24:46,707
What's gotten into them?

756
01:24:46,790 --> 01:24:49,459
Hey there, cut it out!
Go back to your room.

757
01:24:57,301 --> 01:24:59,720
Oh, dear, seems I was careless.

758
01:24:59,803 --> 01:25:01,054
Haku! Oh, no!

759
01:25:22,492 --> 01:25:23,660
Haku.

760
01:25:51,730 --> 01:25:54,858
What on earth is this? Hey! Just wait!

761
01:25:57,694 --> 01:25:59,112
Haku.

762
01:26:02,574 --> 01:26:04,201
Does it hurt?

763
01:26:07,788 --> 01:26:09,915
This is serious.

764
01:26:11,917 --> 01:26:13,251
Haku, don't give up!

765
01:26:13,335 --> 01:26:15,087
Oh, no, he's going to die!

766
01:26:15,587 --> 01:26:18,382
There's something inside him
that's killing him.

767
01:26:18,465 --> 01:26:19,633
Inside him?

768
01:26:19,716 --> 01:26:22,969
It's a good spell. Nothing I can do.

769
01:26:23,261 --> 01:26:26,640
Haku, the River Spirit gave me this.

770
01:26:26,723 --> 01:26:28,850
Eat it, maybe it'll help.

771
01:26:31,269 --> 01:26:33,355
Haku, open your mouth.

772
01:26:33,897 --> 01:26:36,233
Please, Haku, eat it.

773
01:26:37,943 --> 01:26:39,736
See, it's safe.

774
01:26:40,070 --> 01:26:42,114
Is it an herbal cake?

775
01:26:42,406 --> 01:26:45,409
Open. That's a good boy...

776
01:26:49,246 --> 01:26:50,997
That's it.

777
01:26:51,081 --> 01:26:52,541
Swallow.

778
01:27:10,851 --> 01:27:12,269
He spit it out! That's it!

779
01:27:24,990 --> 01:27:26,199
The seal!

780
01:27:26,283 --> 01:27:28,201
It got away! There! Over there.

781
01:27:48,013 --> 01:27:50,599
Gross, gross, Sen! Totally gross.

782
01:27:54,811 --> 01:27:55,729
Clean.

783
01:27:55,812 --> 01:27:58,607
Haku took this
from Yubaba's sister, Kamaji.

784
01:27:58,982 --> 01:28:01,610
From Zeniba? A witch's seal.

785
01:28:02,068 --> 01:28:04,279
Precious loot, I'd say.

786
01:28:06,782 --> 01:28:08,742
Oh... I knew it was Haku!

787
01:28:08,825 --> 01:28:10,410
Look, Kamaji, it's Haku!

788
01:28:12,621 --> 01:28:15,207
Haku!

789
01:28:17,542 --> 01:28:19,586
Kamaji! He's not breathing!

790
01:28:19,669 --> 01:28:23,215
Yes he is, but he's still very ill
from the spell...

791
01:28:32,516 --> 01:28:35,519
That should calm him some.

792
01:28:38,063 --> 01:28:43,151
Haku turned up one day,
just like you.

793
01:28:43,235 --> 01:28:46,279
He said he wanted to learn magic.

794
01:28:46,363 --> 01:28:48,323
I didn't approve...

795
01:28:48,406 --> 01:28:51,868
of him becoming
a sorcerer's apprentice...

796
01:28:52,953 --> 01:28:54,746
I warned him,

797
01:28:55,038 --> 01:28:56,706
but he wouldn't listen.

798
01:28:56,790 --> 01:29:00,335
Said he had nowhere left to go.
He signed up to be Yubaba's apprentice.

799
01:29:00,836 --> 01:29:03,964
As time went by,
he turned increasingly pale,

800
01:29:04,047 --> 01:29:06,967
and his eyes took on a sharp gleam.

801
01:29:09,052 --> 01:29:12,973
Kamaji, I'm going to give this back
to Yubaba's sister.

802
01:29:13,515 --> 01:29:16,893
Give it back, apologize,
and ask her to help Haku.

803
01:29:16,977 --> 01:29:18,854
Tell me where she lives.

804
01:29:19,271 --> 01:29:21,606
Go to Zeniba's?

805
01:29:22,065 --> 01:29:23,984
She's one scary sorceress.

806
01:29:24,067 --> 01:29:24,860
Please.

807
01:29:24,943 --> 01:29:29,114
Haku helped me. Now I want to help him.

808
01:29:31,032 --> 01:29:34,035
You can get there all right...

809
01:29:34,119 --> 01:29:36,079
But getting back...

810
01:29:36,663 --> 01:29:38,123
Wait here.

811
01:29:41,042 --> 01:29:43,878
Let's see now...
It's around here, I think...

812
01:29:44,588 --> 01:29:47,632
Everyone, I need my shoes
and my clothes, please.

813
01:29:55,974 --> 01:29:58,977
Sen! I've been looking for you everywhere.

814
01:30:01,605 --> 01:30:02,689
Lin.

815
01:30:02,772 --> 01:30:05,483
That's Haku. What happened here?

816
01:30:06,151 --> 01:30:07,152
Who are these guys?

817
01:30:08,278 --> 01:30:10,530
My new friends.

818
01:30:10,989 --> 01:30:14,075
Yubaba's tearing the place apart
looking for you.

819
01:30:14,159 --> 01:30:17,787
The big tipper turned out
to be a horrible monster, No Face.

820
01:30:18,288 --> 01:30:20,957
Yubaba says you led him here.

821
01:30:24,169 --> 01:30:25,337
Maybe I did.

822
01:30:25,712 --> 01:30:27,589
You serious?

823
01:30:27,672 --> 01:30:29,549
I just thought he was a customer...

824
01:30:29,633 --> 01:30:32,594
He's already swallowed
three of our people.

825
01:30:33,011 --> 01:30:36,014
Found it! Here it is, Sen.

826
01:30:36,389 --> 01:30:38,141
We're busy, gramps.

827
01:30:38,224 --> 01:30:39,059
You can use this.

828
01:30:39,142 --> 01:30:40,810
TRAIN TICKETS

829
01:30:41,186 --> 01:30:44,105
Train tickets.
Where'd you get them?

830
01:30:44,189 --> 01:30:46,858
I've had them for 40 years.

831
01:30:46,941 --> 01:30:50,445
Now listen, it's the sixth stop,
called Swamp Bottom.

832
01:30:50,737 --> 01:30:51,988
Swamp Bottom.

833
01:30:52,072 --> 01:30:53,907
That's right, it's the sixth stop.

834
01:30:53,990 --> 01:30:54,949
The sixth stop.

835
01:30:55,033 --> 01:30:58,995
Make sure you get it right.
There used to be a return train,

836
01:30:59,079 --> 01:31:02,707
but these days it's a one-way ride.
Still interested.

837
01:31:02,791 --> 01:31:06,252
Yup. I'll walk back, along the tracks.

838
01:31:07,796 --> 01:31:09,589
But what about Yubaba?

839
01:31:09,673 --> 01:31:11,216
I'll go to her now.

840
01:31:11,591 --> 01:31:15,512
I promise I'll be back, Haku.
You can't die.

841
01:31:16,179 --> 01:31:18,098
What's going on here?

842
01:31:18,390 --> 01:31:20,850
Don't you see? It's called... love...

843
01:31:28,817 --> 01:31:30,819
It just keeps getting bigger.

844
01:31:30,902 --> 01:31:32,946
Don't let it swallow me.

845
01:31:33,029 --> 01:31:33,863
Here she comes.

846
01:31:41,496 --> 01:31:42,956
Thank goodness, Sen.

847
01:31:43,039 --> 01:31:45,583
Yubaba can't control him.

848
01:31:48,503 --> 01:31:52,340
There's no need to get upset.
I'm sure Sen will turn up.

849
01:31:52,757 --> 01:31:55,009
Where's Sen! I want Sen.

850
01:31:55,552 --> 01:31:57,220
Go, hurry.

851
01:32:02,559 --> 01:32:04,519
Yubaba, it's Sen.

852
01:32:04,602 --> 01:32:06,104
Where were you?

853
01:32:06,187 --> 01:32:10,567
Sen has come, dear guest.
We'll be right with you.

854
01:32:11,568 --> 01:32:14,696
What took you so long!
This is a complete disaster.

855
01:32:14,779 --> 01:32:17,574
Suck up to him and squeeze
all his gold out of him.

856
01:32:21,578 --> 01:32:23,913
What's that filthy rat?

857
01:32:25,665 --> 01:32:28,042
Don't you recognize him?

858
01:32:28,126 --> 01:32:31,129
Of course not, how disgusting.

859
01:32:31,212 --> 01:32:32,630
Now, in you go.

860
01:32:34,132 --> 01:32:36,384
Call if you need us.

861
01:32:37,302 --> 01:32:39,721
Is she all right in there by herself?

862
01:32:39,804 --> 01:32:41,681
Want to take her place?

863
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:05,330
Try this, it's yummy.

864
01:33:07,457 --> 01:33:11,711
Want some gold?
I'm not giving it to anybody else.

865
01:33:15,715 --> 01:33:17,509
Come over here, Sen.

866
01:33:17,592 --> 01:33:21,221
What is it you want? You can tell me.

867
01:33:21,554 --> 01:33:23,515
Where did you come from?

868
01:33:23,598 --> 01:33:25,975
There's someplace I have to go right away.

869
01:33:28,353 --> 01:33:30,855
You should go back where you came from.

870
01:33:30,939 --> 01:33:33,983
You can't help me with what I want.

871
01:33:35,860 --> 01:33:38,863
Where's your home?
Don't you have a mom and dad?

872
01:33:39,697 --> 01:33:42,992
I don't wanna...

873
01:33:43,952 --> 01:33:47,872
I'm lonely...

874
01:33:48,540 --> 01:33:50,041
Can't you get back home?

875
01:33:50,416 --> 01:33:53,962
I want Sen.

876
01:33:54,587 --> 01:33:55,713
Take the gold.

877
01:33:56,256 --> 01:33:58,466
-Are you going to eat me?
-Take it.

878
01:33:58,550 --> 01:33:59,342
Take it.

879
01:34:08,601 --> 01:34:11,312
If you're going to eat me,
have this first.

880
01:34:11,938 --> 01:34:15,942
I was saving it for my parents,
but you can have it.

881
01:34:36,796 --> 01:34:38,172
Sen.

882
01:34:40,633 --> 01:34:44,804
Girl! What did you feed me?

883
01:34:59,652 --> 01:35:00,987
Out of my way!

884
01:35:02,238 --> 01:35:04,157
Not on my premises!

885
01:35:17,420 --> 01:35:18,838
Over here!

886
01:35:19,631 --> 01:35:20,965
Here!

887
01:36:05,718 --> 01:36:07,387
You'll pay for this.

888
01:36:24,862 --> 01:36:26,906
Sen, over here!

889
01:36:43,256 --> 01:36:45,550
There he is. Over here!

890
01:36:45,633 --> 01:36:47,301
Don't call him over.

891
01:36:51,097 --> 01:36:54,809
He's only bad in the bath house.
He needs to get out of there.

892
01:36:54,892 --> 01:36:57,145
But take him where?

893
01:36:57,228 --> 01:36:58,229
I don't know...

894
01:36:58,312 --> 01:37:02,817
You don't know... He's following us.

895
01:37:20,334 --> 01:37:21,627
From here, you walk.

896
01:37:22,545 --> 01:37:24,338
You'll find the station.

897
01:37:24,422 --> 01:37:25,840
Thank you.

898
01:37:26,466 --> 01:37:28,342
You better come back.

899
01:37:33,473 --> 01:37:37,018
I know I called you a klutz!

900
01:37:37,101 --> 01:37:38,686
I take it back!

901
01:37:46,819 --> 01:37:50,823
No Face, if you so much as touch
that girl, you'll pay for it.

902
01:37:54,285 --> 01:37:55,620
There it is.

903
01:38:07,173 --> 01:38:09,550
Train's coming, here we go.

904
01:38:33,032 --> 01:38:35,284
I'm riding to Swamp Bottom.

905
01:38:41,874 --> 01:38:43,543
You want to come, too?

906
01:38:45,044 --> 01:38:47,046
Him too, please.

907
01:39:27,587 --> 01:39:28,921
Come here.

908
01:39:29,547 --> 01:39:31,215
Behave yourself, OK?

909
01:41:33,379 --> 01:41:34,839
Kamaji.

910
01:41:37,174 --> 01:41:39,927
Oh, Haku... You're awake.

911
01:41:40,011 --> 01:41:41,470
Where's Sen?

912
01:41:41,887 --> 01:41:44,473
What happened? Please tell me.

913
01:41:45,141 --> 01:41:47,601
Don't you remember anything?

914
01:41:48,311 --> 01:41:50,563
Just little pieces.

915
01:41:50,646 --> 01:41:53,566
Chihiro kept calling my name
in the darkness.

916
01:41:54,066 --> 01:41:57,862
I followed her voice
and woke up lying here...

917
01:41:58,237 --> 01:42:00,281
Chihiro, huh...

918
01:42:00,364 --> 01:42:03,117
Her real name's Chihiro.

919
01:42:04,368 --> 01:42:07,246
Can't beat the power of love...

920
01:42:10,916 --> 01:42:12,918
This gold hardly covers the damage.

921
01:42:13,002 --> 01:42:14,128
That fool, Sen.

922
01:42:14,211 --> 01:42:17,048
She just cost me a fortune.

923
01:42:17,548 --> 01:42:21,344
But, Sen did save us, after all.

924
01:42:21,427 --> 01:42:22,553
Silence!

925
01:42:22,636 --> 01:42:25,097
She started it all,

926
01:42:25,181 --> 01:42:27,516
and now she's run away.

927
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:30,269
Even abandoned her own parents!

928
01:42:30,936 --> 01:42:34,774
They must be fine fat pigs by now.
Turn them into bacon or ham.

929
01:42:35,316 --> 01:42:36,776
Please wait.

930
01:42:37,902 --> 01:42:39,070
Master Haku.

931
01:42:39,153 --> 01:42:41,405
What, you still alive?

932
01:42:43,783 --> 01:42:47,161
You still can't see
that you've lost something precious.

933
01:42:47,620 --> 01:42:50,498
Don't get fresh with me.

934
01:42:50,581 --> 01:42:53,042
Since when do you talk that way?

935
01:43:44,885 --> 01:43:46,679
Baby...

936
01:43:52,643 --> 01:43:54,311
Baby!

937
01:43:54,395 --> 01:43:55,396
It's just sand.

938
01:43:55,479 --> 01:43:58,357
Baby!

939
01:43:58,816 --> 01:44:02,653
Where are you, baby?

940
01:44:02,987 --> 01:44:05,656
Come out, please.

941
01:44:18,586 --> 01:44:21,672
You!

942
01:44:24,049 --> 01:44:25,968
Tell me!

943
01:44:28,387 --> 01:44:32,558
Where did you hide my baby?

944
01:44:33,017 --> 01:44:34,852
He's with Zeniba.

945
01:44:34,935 --> 01:44:36,937
Zeniba?

946
01:44:57,917 --> 01:45:01,712
I get it, that evil witch.

947
01:45:01,795 --> 01:45:04,465
So she thinks she's beaten me.

948
01:45:06,091 --> 01:45:08,344
So, what's your plan?

949
01:45:08,719 --> 01:45:10,971
I'll bring baby back.

950
01:45:11,055 --> 01:45:15,351
But in exchange, return Sen
and her parents to the human world.

951
01:45:15,434 --> 01:45:17,853
And what becomes of you?

952
01:45:17,937 --> 01:45:21,857
Let's say I tear you to pieces
after sending them back!

953
01:46:08,654 --> 01:46:10,781
I think this is the right stop...

954
01:46:11,615 --> 01:46:12,950
Let's go.

955
01:46:39,810 --> 01:46:41,687
You can ride on my shoulder.

956
01:48:00,265 --> 01:48:01,934
Come in.

957
01:48:06,730 --> 01:48:08,565
Excuse us.

958
01:48:10,526 --> 01:48:12,945
Well, hurry up and come in, then.

959
01:48:13,404 --> 01:48:14,738
C'mon.

960
01:48:18,033 --> 01:48:19,868
So you all made it.

961
01:48:19,952 --> 01:48:20,536
Um...

962
01:48:21,078 --> 01:48:22,204
Have a seat.

963
01:48:22,538 --> 01:48:24,957
I'll make you some tea.

964
01:48:30,587 --> 01:48:34,758
Zeniba, Haku stole this from you.
I brought it back.

965
01:48:38,095 --> 01:48:40,472
Do you know what this is?

966
01:48:40,889 --> 01:48:43,892
No, but I know it's very precious.

967
01:48:43,976 --> 01:48:47,604
I'm here to apologize for Haku. I'm sorry.

968
01:48:48,522 --> 01:48:52,526
-You felt fine while you held it?
-What?

969
01:48:52,609 --> 01:48:55,320
What's this? The spell is gone.

970
01:48:56,572 --> 01:48:59,742
I'm sorry. I stepped on that strange bug

971
01:48:59,825 --> 01:49:01,577
that was on the seal and squashed it.

972
01:49:02,202 --> 01:49:04,163
Squashed it?

973
01:49:06,415 --> 01:49:09,752
You know,
my sister snuck that bug into the dragon,

974
01:49:09,835 --> 01:49:12,671
so she could control her apprentice.

975
01:49:12,755 --> 01:49:14,923
Squashed it...

976
01:49:18,093 --> 01:49:19,845
You sit too.

977
01:49:19,928 --> 01:49:22,681
You're No Face, aren't you? You sit, too.

978
01:49:23,849 --> 01:49:27,561
Oh, um, please turn
them back into themselves.

979
01:49:27,644 --> 01:49:30,647
Why my dears, the spell's long broken.

980
01:49:30,731 --> 01:49:33,108
You can turn yourselves back.

981
01:49:40,449 --> 01:49:44,286
My sister and I are two halves of a whole,
but we really don't get along.

982
01:49:44,369 --> 01:49:46,997
You've seen what bad taste she has.

983
01:49:47,080 --> 01:49:50,167
Sorceress twins
are just a recipe for trouble.

984
01:49:54,171 --> 01:49:58,717
I'd like to help you, dear,
but there's nothing I can do.

985
01:49:58,801 --> 01:50:00,719
It's one of our rules here.

986
01:50:01,303 --> 01:50:04,306
You've got to take care of your parents
and that dragon boyfriend of yours,

987
01:50:04,389 --> 01:50:06,058
on your own.

988
01:50:06,141 --> 01:50:08,977
But, um, can't you even give me a hint?

989
01:50:09,436 --> 01:50:13,023
I feel like Haku and I met
a long time ago.

990
01:50:13,106 --> 01:50:14,983
In that case, it's easy.

991
01:50:15,317 --> 01:50:18,237
Nothing that happens, is ever forgotten,

992
01:50:18,320 --> 01:50:20,280
even if you can't remember it.

993
01:50:21,615 --> 01:50:24,952
It's already late.
Why don't you stay the night?

994
01:50:25,327 --> 01:50:28,163
You boys give me a hand.

995
01:50:34,294 --> 01:50:36,296
Keep at it.

996
01:50:39,299 --> 01:50:43,512
That's right, you're terrific.
You're a big help...

997
01:50:44,346 --> 01:50:47,641
A magic one won't do the trick.

998
01:50:48,976 --> 01:50:53,355
Pull it through there... And do it again.

999
01:50:53,438 --> 01:50:56,191
I really have to go home, Granny.

1000
01:50:56,608 --> 01:51:00,320
Haku could die
while I'm just sitting here...

1001
01:51:00,404 --> 01:51:03,991
They might eat my mom and dad.

1002
01:51:06,159 --> 01:51:08,370
Just wait a little longer.

1003
01:51:08,996 --> 01:51:10,497
There we are.

1004
01:51:11,373 --> 01:51:13,667
Use it to tie back your hair.

1005
01:51:17,796 --> 01:51:19,381
It's so pretty.

1006
01:51:19,673 --> 01:51:24,511
It'll protect you.
I made it from the thread they spun.

1007
01:51:24,845 --> 01:51:26,430
Thank you.

1008
01:51:35,689 --> 01:51:39,568
What good timing.
We've got another guest, let him in.

1009
01:51:39,651 --> 01:51:40,736
Sure.

1010
01:51:54,041 --> 01:51:55,083
Haku!

1011
01:51:58,378 --> 01:51:59,963
Thank goodness.

1012
01:52:00,255 --> 01:52:02,758
Aren't you hurt? You sure you're OK?

1013
01:52:03,050 --> 01:52:03,967
Thank goodness.

1014
01:52:05,886 --> 01:52:08,138
Good timing, I'd say.

1015
01:52:08,972 --> 01:52:11,266
Look, Granny, Haku's alive.

1016
01:52:11,767 --> 01:52:15,979
Haku, I no longer blame you
for what you did.

1017
01:52:16,063 --> 01:52:19,358
Just be sure you protect the girl.

1018
01:52:19,775 --> 01:52:22,736
OK, boys, time to go home.

1019
01:52:22,819 --> 01:52:24,947
Come back soon.

1020
01:52:25,614 --> 01:52:29,993
You, stick around and be my helper.

1021
01:52:32,454 --> 01:52:33,372
Granny!

1022
01:52:34,081 --> 01:52:36,249
Thank you, I'm going now.

1023
01:52:36,333 --> 01:52:39,461
I'm sure you can manage everything.

1024
01:52:39,544 --> 01:52:42,839
My real name is Chihiro.

1025
01:52:42,923 --> 01:52:45,425
Chihiro... What a nice name.

1026
01:52:45,509 --> 01:52:48,261
-Take good care of it, it's yours.
-I will!

1027
01:52:48,345 --> 01:52:50,138
-Off you go.
-Yes.

1028
01:52:51,807 --> 01:52:54,935
Thank you, granny. Good bye.

1029
01:53:44,026 --> 01:53:45,736
Listen, Haku.

1030
01:53:45,819 --> 01:53:49,364
I don't remember it, but my mom told me...

1031
01:53:49,781 --> 01:53:53,368
Once, when I was little,
I fell into a river.

1032
01:53:53,869 --> 01:53:57,539
She said they'd drained it
and built things on top.

1033
01:53:57,873 --> 01:54:00,042
But I've just remembered.

1034
01:54:01,168 --> 01:54:02,836
The river was called...

1035
01:54:03,211 --> 01:54:06,465
Its name was the Kohaku River.

1036
01:54:07,007 --> 01:54:10,218
Your real name is Kohaku.

1037
01:54:31,448 --> 01:54:33,116
Chihiro, thank you.

1038
01:54:33,200 --> 01:54:36,370
My real name is Nigihayami Kohaku Nushi.

1039
01:54:36,912 --> 01:54:37,954
Nigihayami?

1040
01:54:38,038 --> 01:54:40,290
Nigihayami Kohaku Nushi.

1041
01:54:40,374 --> 01:54:42,876
What a name!
Sounds like a guardian spirit.

1042
01:54:43,251 --> 01:54:47,714
I also remember
how you fell into me as a child.

1043
01:54:47,798 --> 01:54:49,466
You were chasing your shoe.

1044
01:54:49,925 --> 01:54:54,304
Yes, you carried me
to shallow water, Kohaku.

1045
01:54:54,930 --> 01:54:56,139
I'm so grateful...

1046
01:55:28,964 --> 01:55:30,674
They're back!

1047
01:55:43,979 --> 01:55:46,773
You brought Baby back with you, right?

1048
01:55:49,276 --> 01:55:50,193
Baba.

1049
01:55:50,277 --> 01:55:54,739
You're not hurt?
What a terrible time you had.

1050
01:55:56,116 --> 01:55:59,035
Baby, you're standing all by yourself?
When...

1051
01:55:59,661 --> 01:56:01,955
Yubaba, you promised.

1052
01:56:02,038 --> 01:56:04,791
Please return Chihiro's family
to the human world.

1053
01:56:05,333 --> 01:56:07,878
Not so fast.

1054
01:56:07,961 --> 01:56:10,964
This world has rules, you know.

1055
01:56:11,673 --> 01:56:12,883
Shut up!

1056
01:56:12,966 --> 01:56:15,510
Baba, don't be so mean. Just do it.

1057
01:56:15,844 --> 01:56:18,388
Baby had such a good time.

1058
01:56:18,889 --> 01:56:21,725
But, a rule's a rule.

1059
01:56:21,808 --> 01:56:24,060
Otherwise I can't break the spell.

1060
01:56:24,352 --> 01:56:27,439
If you make Sen cry,
I won't like you anymore, Baba.

1061
01:56:27,981 --> 01:56:29,149
Why that's--

1062
01:56:29,232 --> 01:56:30,609
Granny.

1063
01:56:30,692 --> 01:56:31,943
Granny?

1064
01:56:32,360 --> 01:56:34,404
I'm coming to you.

1065
01:56:45,832 --> 01:56:48,168
Haku told me all about the rule.

1066
01:56:48,251 --> 01:56:50,086
At least you've got guts.

1067
01:56:50,170 --> 01:56:53,465
Here's your contract. Come over here.

1068
01:56:53,548 --> 01:56:56,009
I won't be a minute, Baby.

1069
01:56:56,718 --> 01:56:58,053
Don't worry.

1070
01:57:02,516 --> 01:57:06,353
See if you can guess
which of them are yours.

1071
01:57:15,695 --> 01:57:17,197
You only get one guess.

1072
01:57:17,280 --> 01:57:19,824
Get it right, and you're all free.

1073
01:57:31,753 --> 01:57:35,340
Granny, this is no good.
My parents aren't here.

1074
01:57:35,715 --> 01:57:39,094
Not here? That's your answer?

1075
01:57:40,720 --> 01:57:41,680
Yes.

1076
01:57:44,558 --> 01:57:47,519
Bingo!

1077
01:57:47,852 --> 01:57:50,397
Thatta girl! Right on!

1078
01:57:54,276 --> 01:57:55,652
Thank you, everyone.

1079
01:57:55,735 --> 01:57:58,989
Go! You win. Just get out of here.

1080
01:57:59,447 --> 01:58:01,408
Thank you for everything.

1081
01:58:02,075 --> 01:58:03,368
Good bye.

1082
01:58:04,119 --> 01:58:05,245
Thank you.

1083
01:58:05,328 --> 01:58:06,371
Come and see us.

1084
01:58:06,746 --> 01:58:08,415
-Haku...
-Let's go.

1085
01:58:09,124 --> 01:58:11,710
-Where are Mom and Dad?
-They've gone on ahead.

1086
01:58:19,301 --> 01:58:20,677
There's no water.

1087
01:58:20,760 --> 01:58:22,262
I can't go any farther.

1088
01:58:22,762 --> 01:58:25,140
Go back the way you came, Chihiro.

1089
01:58:25,223 --> 01:58:28,143
But don't ever look back.
Not until you're out of the tunnel.

1090
01:58:28,351 --> 01:58:30,520
What about you, Haku?

1091
01:58:31,396 --> 01:58:33,857
I'll speak to Yubaba.
Quit my apprenticeship.

1092
01:58:33,940 --> 01:58:36,401
I'm fine, now that I have my name back.

1093
01:58:36,985 --> 01:58:38,862
I'll go back to my world, too.

1094
01:58:38,945 --> 01:58:41,323
-Can we meet again?
-I'm sure.

1095
01:58:41,406 --> 01:58:43,033
-Promise?
-Promise.

1096
01:58:43,116 --> 01:58:45,660
Now go, and don't look back.

1097
01:59:08,350 --> 01:59:09,893
Chihiro.

1098
01:59:10,310 --> 01:59:12,896
Where have you been? Hurry up.

1099
01:59:16,483 --> 01:59:18,318
Mom! Dad!

1100
01:59:18,401 --> 01:59:20,195
You can't just run off like that.

1101
01:59:20,278 --> 01:59:21,613
Away we go.

1102
01:59:22,030 --> 01:59:24,240
Mom, are you sure you're OK?

1103
01:59:24,324 --> 01:59:28,578
What?
I'm sure the moving van's there by now.

1104
01:59:37,962 --> 01:59:40,215
Hurry along, Chihiro.

1105
01:59:48,890 --> 01:59:50,684
Watch your step.

1106
01:59:50,767 --> 01:59:54,062
You'll make me trip, Chihiro,
clinging like that.

1107
02:00:06,324 --> 02:00:07,826
The end of the tunnel.

1108
02:00:08,201 --> 02:00:09,452
Hey...

1109
02:00:09,744 --> 02:00:11,079
What is it?

1110
02:00:11,913 --> 02:00:13,707
Will you look at that...

1111
02:00:14,916 --> 02:00:17,335
It's all dusty inside, too.

1112
02:00:17,419 --> 02:00:18,920
-Some kind of joke?
-You think?

1113
02:00:19,671 --> 02:00:22,173
I told you not to stop here.

1114
02:00:27,721 --> 02:00:30,223
OK, all clear.

1115
02:00:31,433 --> 02:00:33,727
We're off, Chihiro.

1116
02:00:33,810 --> 02:00:36,604
Hurry up, Chihiro.

1117
02:04:30,421 --> 02:04:31,464
THE END
