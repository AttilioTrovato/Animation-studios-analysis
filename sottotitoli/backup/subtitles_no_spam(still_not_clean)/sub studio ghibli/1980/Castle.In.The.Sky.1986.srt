1
00:00:32,027 --> 00:00:33,255
What's going on?

2
00:00:33,328 --> 00:00:35,592
- Come on, boys!
- Where is it?

3
00:00:35,664 --> 00:00:38,758
There it is!
Right on schedule!

4
00:00:41,503 --> 00:00:43,801
Ha ha ha!

5
00:00:43,872 --> 00:00:47,035
- Let's go!
- Aye-aye!

6
00:01:35,423 --> 00:01:36,651
It's Dola!

7
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,990
- Huh?
- Ha ha ha!

8
00:01:47,068 --> 00:01:49,195
We're under attack!

9
00:01:49,271 --> 00:01:52,104
Mayday! Mayday!

10
00:01:53,141 --> 00:01:55,336
- Let's go, Louie!
- Get 'em, boys!

11
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:58,106
- Come on! Aah!
- Wait for me!

12
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,843
- Keep going!
- Come on!

13
00:02:01,917 --> 00:02:03,885
- Pirates!
- Excuse me!

14
00:02:03,952 --> 00:02:05,351
Follow me!

15
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,888
Ladies and gentlemen,
don't move.

16
00:02:07,956 --> 00:02:09,082
Gangway!

17
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:12,092
Mom, look out!

18
00:02:16,164 --> 00:02:17,290
- Hold them off!
- Yes, sir!

19
00:02:17,365 --> 00:02:19,799
Sheeta, stay out of the way
and you won't get hurt.

20
00:02:44,726 --> 00:02:46,159
Aah!

21
00:02:46,228 --> 00:02:48,321
Don't let them through!

22
00:02:48,396 --> 00:02:50,694
- I want that girl!
- Come on!

23
00:02:55,737 --> 00:02:58,638
Open up in there!
You sure it's this cabin?

24
00:02:58,707 --> 00:03:00,436
She's in there
all right.

25
00:03:00,508 --> 00:03:02,203
Hurry up!
Break the door down!

26
00:03:02,277 --> 00:03:05,713
1, 2, 3!
Put some shoulder into it!

27
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,940
Aah!

28
00:03:07,015 --> 00:03:09,540
Yaah! Oof!

29
00:03:09,618 --> 00:03:12,451
Hey, wait!
Who's this? Muska?

30
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,954
- Where is she?
- She's not here.

31
00:03:15,023 --> 00:03:16,217
No!

32
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:18,384
Hey, I found her!
She's hiding out here!

33
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:21,554
Don't let her escape!
Quick, get her!

34
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,860
Whoa, Ma!
Don't let me go!

35
00:03:23,932 --> 00:03:25,365
Quit your whining!
I got you!

36
00:03:25,433 --> 00:03:26,866
Aah!
She's wearing the crystal!

37
00:03:26,935 --> 00:03:28,960
- Now, go get her!
- Right!

38
00:03:29,037 --> 00:03:31,870
I want that crystal!
Sheeta!

39
00:03:35,343 --> 00:03:36,401
Come here!

40
00:03:37,545 --> 00:03:39,376
Aaah!

41
00:03:39,447 --> 00:03:42,883
Oh, no!
There goes my crystal!

42
00:03:42,951 --> 00:03:45,181
Oh, no!

43
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:24,347
I need some meatballs
for the boss, please.

44
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:26,545
All right. You're sure
working late tonight, Pazu.

45
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,986
Things are finally busy
for a change.

46
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:31,752
- Still working?
- Yep. Bye!

47
00:06:32,793 --> 00:06:35,523
Better hurry.
Boss is gonna be hungry.

48
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:37,621
Huh?

49
00:06:41,435 --> 00:06:43,528
What is that?

50
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:52,737
Looks like a body! Whoa!

51
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:56,944
Whoa!

52
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:59,713
Aah! Whoa! Whoa!

53
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,028
Yaah!

54
00:07:15,436 --> 00:07:16,698
Huh?

55
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,540
Aah!

56
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:47,663
Pazu!

57
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:49,634
What are you doing up there?

58
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:51,295
Did you bring my dinner?

59
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:52,668
Yeah, I did!

60
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:54,764
But this girl
came down from the sky!

61
00:08:00,848 --> 00:08:02,076
Ohh...

62
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,548
Blast these old pipes!

63
00:08:03,617 --> 00:08:05,175
Aah! Whoa.

64
00:08:05,252 --> 00:08:06,913
Uh, here you go.

65
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,750
Boss!

66
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,757
Come on! Come on!

67
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:16,658
Listen, Boss!
A girl came--

68
00:08:18,232 --> 00:08:20,200
What? Not again!

69
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:22,531
Just when I get
one thing fixed--

70
00:08:22,603 --> 00:08:24,764
Listen to me!
A girl came down--

71
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,863
Tighten
the second valve, will you?

72
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,464
There's no time to lose!

73
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:31,204
Ah, this machinery's too old!

74
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:40,945
- I need a bigger wrench!
- I'll get it!

75
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:45,952
Go run the hoist
while I fix this!

76
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,118
Huh?

77
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:50,322
- Think you can do it?
- Yeah! Here!

78
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:52,991
Just stay calm
and use your head!

79
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:55,466
Right.

80
00:08:58,539 --> 00:08:59,767
That's it!

81
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,308
Don't forget to keep
an eye on that pulley!

82
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,818
- Hit the brake!
- What?

83
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,328
Whew.

84
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:24,989
Well, how'd it go, boys?

85
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:28,159
No silver,
not even any trace of tin.

86
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:30,328
We're just not having any luck.

87
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:31,837
Maybe we would
if we tried digging...

88
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:33,167
the mines just east of here.

89
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,172
I don't know.

90
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:35,799
Those mines are worse
than this one.

91
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:37,605
We just have to start
all over again.

92
00:09:37,678 --> 00:09:40,169
Let's call it a day.
Good night.

93
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:42,681
- 'Night.
- 'Night.

94
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:54,585
Shut off the boiler, Pazu.

95
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:56,891
We're not gonna find
anything today.

96
00:09:56,964 --> 00:10:01,765
If things keep going like this.
We'll all be starving soon.

97
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:05,066
And, Pazu, maybe you can oil
the blasted machine!

98
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:07,868
- OK!
- Thanks. Good night.

99
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,272
'Night!

100
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:13,738
- Mom is gonna be mad at you!
- Leave me alone!

101
00:10:16,316 --> 00:10:17,874
I'm not the one
that let her get away.

102
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,475
Enough already! Stop!

103
00:10:19,553 --> 00:10:20,713
All right!

104
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,914
Mom, it's no use.
Let's call it off.

105
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,220
There's too much cloud cover.
It's too dark!

106
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,385
- What?!
- Told you.

107
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:28,485
Mom, don't worry.
I'll find her!

108
00:10:28,562 --> 00:10:30,029
We'll all find her!
And call me captain!

109
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:31,394
Yes, Mom!

110
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:24,903
Mmm.

111
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:05,044
Ohh!

112
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:10,619
Hello!

113
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,885
It's about time you got up!

114
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,895
Wait, guys.
I'm trying to talk to the lady.

115
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,453
How are you feeling?

116
00:13:18,532 --> 00:13:20,898
Come on, guys,
knock it off!

117
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,662
Hi, there!
My name's Pazu.

118
00:13:22,736 --> 00:13:24,465
I'm really glad to see
you're doing all right.

119
00:13:24,538 --> 00:13:25,766
You had me worried there.

120
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,501
Go ahead. Feed them.

121
00:13:28,575 --> 00:13:30,270
- Don't be shy.
- Aah!

122
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:34,946
These guys are really happy
we have a visitor.

123
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:38,911
Well, thank goodness.

124
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:40,919
You laugh
like a regular person.

125
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,750
The way you fell from the sky...

126
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:44,757
I thought maybe you were
an angel or something.

127
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:46,759
Thank you very much
for saving me.

128
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:48,692
Oh, I'm sorry.
My name's Sheeta.

129
00:13:48,762 --> 00:13:50,923
Sheeta--
what a beautiful name.

130
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:53,465
I had to catch you.
You were just floating.

131
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,296
- What? Floating?
- Yeah.

132
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:57,836
Well, I remember an airship...

133
00:13:57,904 --> 00:14:00,270
but I can't remember
anything else.

134
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,864
That's all you remember?

135
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:05,341
Mm-hmm. I'm not sure
how I survived.

136
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:06,709
Hmm.

137
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,372
Well, I think I might
have an idea about that.

138
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:10,382
May I see your necklace
for a second?

139
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,042
This?

140
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:14,882
Yeah. Do you mind?

141
00:14:14,955 --> 00:14:16,684
My grandmother gave it to me.

142
00:14:16,756 --> 00:14:19,782
It's been in my family
for generations.

143
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,293
Wow, it's beautiful.

144
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,988
Could you hold this?

145
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:29,800
- Let me help you.
- Oh.

146
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:33,733
Thanks. Heh.

147
00:14:33,807 --> 00:14:35,968
Get a load of this! Watch!

148
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:37,566
Here I go-o-o!

149
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:46,009
Pazu! Are you all right?
Answer me!

150
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:48,418
Can you hear me?

151
00:14:52,092 --> 00:14:54,788
Unh!

152
00:14:56,997 --> 00:14:59,192
Ha! Well, so maybe
I had the wrong idea...

153
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:00,893
about this necklace. Aah!

154
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:04,269
Oh!

155
00:15:07,307 --> 00:15:10,674
Are you hurt?
I'll be right down!

156
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,184
Aah! Aah!

157
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,152
Whoa!

158
00:15:22,622 --> 00:15:25,523
I'm so sorry, Pazu.

159
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:28,356
- Ohh.
- Are you OK?

160
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:29,520
I'm fine.

161
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,530
Oh, you scared me.
Does it hurt much?

162
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:34,032
Are you kidding?
If my head were any harder...

163
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,226
you could use it
as a cannonball.

164
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:42,870
Whoa! The kettle!
It must be boiling over!

165
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:45,434
Come on! Let's go!
Follow me! This way!

166
00:15:45,512 --> 00:15:48,208
I'll get breakfast started.
You can wash up over there.

167
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:51,049
There's a clean towel, too.

168
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:52,584
Great. Thank you.

169
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:12,664
"Laputa."

170
00:16:16,276 --> 00:16:19,439
Sheeta!
It's time for breakfast!

171
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:30,589
My father took that picture
from an airship.

172
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:31,988
He loved to fly.

173
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:34,356
It's Laputa--
the floating island.

174
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:36,395
An island
that floats in the sky?

175
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:38,624
Yep. Most people think
it's just a legend...

176
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:40,427
but my dad actually saw it.

177
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,730
That's a picture
of his airship.

178
00:17:02,122 --> 00:17:04,886
It looked like a castle
just floating there in the sky.

179
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:08,257
He said it was the most amazing
thing he'd ever seen.

180
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:21,299
And that's the only picture
he was able to take.

181
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:23,706
But take
a look at this, Sheeta.

182
00:17:23,777 --> 00:17:25,472
Dad kept a journal,
and he made all sorts...

183
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,137
of drawings of Laputa, see?

184
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,238
There it is.
He drew the castle...

185
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:32,045
and also what he thought
the people'd look like.

186
00:17:32,118 --> 00:17:34,313
He was sure the castle
was filled with treasure...

187
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,753
but nobody believed him.

188
00:17:36,823 --> 00:17:38,154
They called him a liar.

189
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:41,887
Being called a liar
is what killed him.

190
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:50,259
But I am gonna prove that
my dad was no liar, Sheeta.

191
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:52,270
As soon as I'm done building
this plane...

192
00:17:52,338 --> 00:17:56,274
I'm gonna take off
and find Laputa myself.

193
00:18:02,716 --> 00:18:04,411
Hmm.

194
00:18:04,484 --> 00:18:05,849
Ohh!

195
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,683
It's a real automobile!
You don't see many here!

196
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:11,087
- Those people are pirates.
- What?

197
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:13,557
They're the ones
who attacked the airship.

198
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:17,562
They're probably after you.
Come on!

199
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:21,357
- Check around back.
- Right.

200
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:24,865
Good morning!
Good-bye!

201
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:26,701
Hold it! Wait up!

202
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:28,798
Yes?
How can I help you, mister?

203
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:30,775
Young man, query--

204
00:18:30,844 --> 00:18:32,311
Have you seen a little girl
around here?

205
00:18:32,378 --> 00:18:33,606
Let me see now.

206
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,012
There are about 100 girls
in this town. Which one?

207
00:18:36,082 --> 00:18:37,515
Thanks for nothing, kid!

208
00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:38,744
Bye!

209
00:18:40,353 --> 00:18:42,787
They are definitely
after you, Sheeta.

210
00:18:44,023 --> 00:18:46,491
Louie, go tell your mother!
She's in disguise!

211
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,857
So, she's in disguise!
Go tell my mother!

212
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,560
She's got pigtails
and a purple dress.

213
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,160
Haven't seen her.

214
00:18:58,238 --> 00:18:59,671
That's what you keep saying...

215
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:01,730
but I want you think
really hard about it.

216
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,070
Boss!

217
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:04,906
Boss!

218
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:09,405
She'd be about the age
of those two.

219
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:10,813
Aah! Oh, no!

220
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:15,319
There she is!
Don't let her get away!

221
00:19:15,388 --> 00:19:16,582
Now!

222
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:17,987
Yeow!

223
00:19:18,057 --> 00:19:21,754
Hey, boss, they're pirates!
They're after her!

224
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:24,922
Do I have to do
everything myself?

225
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:27,466
Pirates? I want to see!

226
00:19:29,035 --> 00:19:31,629
You can stop right there,
my friend.

227
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:33,262
Think you're tough, don't you?

228
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:35,637
- I'm tough enough.
- We'll see about that.

229
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:38,643
Just go away.
We're honest folks here.

230
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:40,008
What did you do that for?

231
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:41,671
Quick, leave from the back.

232
00:19:41,748 --> 00:19:43,181
No, I'm gonna fight 'em!

233
00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:45,149
Pazu, what if you wind up
getting yourself hurt?

234
00:19:45,218 --> 00:19:46,810
So?!

235
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:48,820
So, somebody's got
to protect your friend.

236
00:19:48,888 --> 00:19:52,153
Hmm? Oh. Mm-hmm.

237
00:19:52,225 --> 00:19:54,193
Why don't you get
out of our way?

238
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,285
Why don't you
just try and make me?

239
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:57,954
Maybe I will!

240
00:19:58,031 --> 00:20:00,625
Oh, yeah!
Make your shirt explode.

241
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:06,636
Ladies and gentlemen.
Keep your eye on the buttons.

242
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,833
A-one, a-two,
and a-here we go!

243
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:12,503
Oh, yeah! Stand back!
He'll pop your buttons!

244
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:14,570
Hey, Boss, show him
what you're made of!

245
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:19,014
Yeah.
Yeah, we're real scared.

246
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:22,877
Ha ha ha!

247
00:20:22,956 --> 00:20:24,890
Mm-hmm.

248
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:27,119
That's it!
You showed him, boss!

249
00:20:27,193 --> 00:20:29,889
I'm not mending that,
I hope you know.

250
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:33,199
Take that, you landlubber!

251
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:35,928
- He took it.
- He certainly did.

252
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,901
Come on, Shalulu!

253
00:20:41,975 --> 00:20:44,000
Give him
something for nothing!

254
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:45,476
Ooh!

255
00:20:45,545 --> 00:20:47,069
You go get him, boss!

256
00:20:47,146 --> 00:20:48,170
Unh!

257
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:50,842
He said Mom was ugly,
now go get him!

258
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:52,009
- Oh!
- Raah!

259
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:53,484
That's it! Get him!

260
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:55,043
- That's it!
- Punch him!

261
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:56,850
Come on, you got it!

262
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:59,414
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Hey, loudmouth!

263
00:20:59,492 --> 00:21:01,790
No... Unh!

264
00:21:01,861 --> 00:21:04,159
Get in there!
Give him a right, a left!

265
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:14,702
Whoa! Oh...

266
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:17,436
Leave it to my little idiots
to start a riot.

267
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:20,240
Now... where is she?

268
00:21:20,313 --> 00:21:22,679
Where are you, sweetie?

269
00:21:22,749 --> 00:21:24,774
Oh, you've made a friend.

270
00:21:24,851 --> 00:21:27,012
And they're headed for
the railroad tracks.

271
00:21:27,086 --> 00:21:28,110
Let's move it!

272
00:21:32,358 --> 00:21:35,759
Hey! Hey!

273
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:37,557
We're gonna jump on, Sheeta!

274
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,257
Right! Unh!

275
00:21:39,332 --> 00:21:41,061
That's it!

276
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:43,568
- Come on!
- Unh!

277
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:46,628
Hey, Pazu,
who's your friend there?

278
00:21:46,706 --> 00:21:49,732
Her name is Sheeta!
Pirates are after us!

279
00:21:51,544 --> 00:21:54,342
- It's the Dola gang!
- Pirates?

280
00:21:54,414 --> 00:21:56,939
Can you drop us at the police
station in the next town?

281
00:21:57,016 --> 00:21:58,950
Sure.
Help me stoke up the engine!

282
00:21:59,018 --> 00:22:01,111
Will do!

283
00:22:01,187 --> 00:22:04,122
Full speed ahead!

284
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:07,489
- Huh?
- Hey, it's Mom!

285
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:10,087
Hi, Mom!

286
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:12,961
You chowderheads!
Get your brother and hop on!

287
00:22:13,032 --> 00:22:15,466
But Sheeta's hiding
inside that house.

288
00:22:15,535 --> 00:22:18,333
They made an escape.
Now, step on it!

289
00:22:18,404 --> 00:22:19,632
They escaped?

290
00:22:19,706 --> 00:22:21,367
- I want to come!
- Mommy!

291
00:22:25,445 --> 00:22:27,470
I don't think
they like you boys much.

292
00:22:27,547 --> 00:22:29,174
Unh! Hey!

293
00:22:29,248 --> 00:22:31,512
Well...

294
00:22:31,584 --> 00:22:35,315
Here's a little something
to remember us by! Ha ha!

295
00:22:36,723 --> 00:22:39,715
Bumpy back here, Mom.
Very bumpy.

296
00:22:48,301 --> 00:22:51,566
Hey, Pazu, here they come!

297
00:22:51,637 --> 00:22:54,333
Can't this engine go any faster?

298
00:22:54,407 --> 00:22:56,602
This is the best she'll do!
She's old!

299
00:22:56,676 --> 00:22:59,372
- There she is, Mom!
- I wanted to say that!

300
00:22:59,445 --> 00:23:02,903
Floor it! Move over!

301
00:23:10,256 --> 00:23:12,554
I'd really prefer
to be in the car, Mother!

302
00:23:14,627 --> 00:23:16,857
Scary ride!

303
00:23:19,032 --> 00:23:21,762
We're not gonna make it!

304
00:23:27,106 --> 00:23:30,041
Increase the steam!
They're gaining on us!

305
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:32,543
- Prepare to board!
- We got 'em!

306
00:23:32,612 --> 00:23:34,546
- Yaah!
- I can't see!

307
00:23:34,614 --> 00:23:36,548
We need you in here!

308
00:23:38,117 --> 00:23:41,018
- Help with the fire!
- OK!

309
00:23:45,258 --> 00:23:46,919
Aah!

310
00:23:46,993 --> 00:23:48,585
Yaah!

311
00:23:49,829 --> 00:23:51,023
Uh-oh!

312
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:53,258
Unh! Charge!

313
00:23:53,332 --> 00:23:54,924
- Look out!
- Aah!

314
00:23:56,836 --> 00:23:59,270
You all right?

315
00:23:59,338 --> 00:24:01,966
Come on!
Get 'em! Get 'em!

316
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:08,444
That's a strong little girl.

317
00:24:13,252 --> 00:24:16,221
Hey, come back here! No!

318
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:17,756
Bye-bye!

319
00:24:19,659 --> 00:24:22,651
You'll get yours!
Don't just stand there!

320
00:24:22,728 --> 00:24:23,854
Push this train
over the cliff!

321
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:25,090
What?

322
00:24:25,164 --> 00:24:28,998
Ha ha ha!
We sure showed them!

323
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:31,332
- I can do it now.
- You were amazing!

324
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:37,576
- Heave! Heave!
- And heave...

325
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:39,406
- Wait.
- And stop.

326
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:42,778
A military spy plane!

327
00:24:42,849 --> 00:24:45,317
You think maybe it's Muska?

328
00:24:45,384 --> 00:24:48,820
It's Muska, all right.
We gotta find those kids.

329
00:24:55,862 --> 00:24:57,796
Huh?

330
00:25:02,602 --> 00:25:04,365
What do you know about that?

331
00:25:04,437 --> 00:25:06,029
It's the army to the rescue!

332
00:25:11,711 --> 00:25:15,203
Hey! Could you kindly help
these two young people?

333
00:25:15,281 --> 00:25:17,841
Pirates have been
chasing them all day!

334
00:25:26,526 --> 00:25:29,427
Huh? What's the matter?

335
00:25:29,495 --> 00:25:30,826
Good-bye, Pazu!

336
00:25:30,897 --> 00:25:32,455
Young lady, come back here!

337
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:35,467
- Unh!
- Oh!

338
00:25:35,535 --> 00:25:37,127
Sheeta, wait!

339
00:25:37,203 --> 00:25:39,501
Halt, or I'll shoot!

340
00:25:39,572 --> 00:25:41,039
- Aah!
- Ow!

341
00:25:41,107 --> 00:25:43,041
Wait for me!

342
00:25:44,477 --> 00:25:46,035
It's an armored train, Mother!

343
00:25:46,112 --> 00:25:48,376
And we're
the Dola gang! Attack!

344
00:25:48,447 --> 00:25:51,211
No! Hey! Sheeta!

345
00:25:51,284 --> 00:25:53,616
Don't follow me!
You'll get hurt!

346
00:25:53,686 --> 00:25:55,483
Aah!

347
00:25:59,325 --> 00:26:01,020
Whoa!

348
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:14,668
Aah!

349
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,231
- Don't let go!
- Don't worry!

350
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:21,372
Ooh, that smarts!

351
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:24,375
Come on!

352
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:30,381
Ooh. This should
be interesting.

353
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:37,028
- What's going on?
- Where are they?

354
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:39,030
Be quiet!
Just watch them.

355
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:52,209
Ohh!

356
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:57,810
Ahh!

357
00:26:59,752 --> 00:27:02,220
Huh? Oh!

358
00:27:03,389 --> 00:27:05,619
Sheeta, we're floating!

359
00:27:07,927 --> 00:27:09,087
You see?

360
00:27:09,161 --> 00:27:11,129
This was what happened
the first time I saw you.

361
00:27:11,197 --> 00:27:13,597
See that?
It's the power of the crystal.

362
00:27:15,701 --> 00:27:16,963
I knew it!

363
00:27:17,036 --> 00:27:19,129
I knew there was something
special about your necklace!

364
00:27:19,205 --> 00:27:22,072
- Oh!
- Whoo!

365
00:27:23,943 --> 00:27:25,877
See what I mean?

366
00:27:29,115 --> 00:27:30,844
It's gonna be all right.

367
00:27:35,855 --> 00:27:38,346
The necklace will let us down
nice and easy.

368
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:46,694
Boys, I want that crystal!

369
00:27:46,766 --> 00:27:48,700
Fire!

370
00:27:48,768 --> 00:27:51,328
Time to run!

371
00:27:53,406 --> 00:27:56,341
Look out!

372
00:27:56,409 --> 00:27:58,775
It's fantastic!
Incredible!

373
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:01,677
I must have that crystal!

374
00:28:15,294 --> 00:28:17,524
You were right about my crystal.

375
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:22,095
It's going out!

376
00:28:22,168 --> 00:28:24,398
Ah, wait. Just a minute.

377
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:34,209
I guess your necklace
must come to life...

378
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,747
whenever you're in trouble.

379
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:40,078
Wow, that's a long way up.

380
00:28:40,152 --> 00:28:42,052
I hope they're all right--

381
00:28:42,121 --> 00:28:44,419
your boss and his wife
and that nice train engineer.

382
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:45,616
My friends are all miners.

383
00:28:45,691 --> 00:28:47,283
They can take
care of themselves.

384
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,055
I wouldn't worry about them
if I were you.

385
00:28:49,128 --> 00:28:50,595
Come on, Sheeta. Let's go.

386
00:28:54,734 --> 00:28:56,065
This has been
a mining town...

387
00:28:56,135 --> 00:28:57,227
as long as
anyone can remember.

388
00:28:57,303 --> 00:29:00,534
Most of these tunnels
aren't even used anymore.

389
00:29:09,782 --> 00:29:12,012
Here you go.

390
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:14,177
Thank you. I'm glad
you brought some food.

391
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:15,811
I'm starving.

392
00:29:15,888 --> 00:29:18,186
For dessert, I've got
a green apple and some candy.

393
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:21,954
Really? That bag of yours
must be magic.

394
00:29:22,027 --> 00:29:24,154
It's always
got just what we need.

395
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:29,234
Ha!

396
00:29:32,571 --> 00:29:33,503
Mmm!

397
00:29:33,572 --> 00:29:36,302
Not bad, huh?

398
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:40,605
Sheeta, where exactly
do you come from?

399
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:44,171
I come from Gondoa--
deep in the northern mountains.

400
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:46,241
I used to live there
with my parents...

401
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:48,309
and we were very happy.

402
00:29:49,855 --> 00:29:51,379
But when my mother
and father died...

403
00:29:51,457 --> 00:29:53,755
I was all alone.

404
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:57,152
The only thing
that kept me going...

405
00:29:57,229 --> 00:30:00,687
was the farm and
taking care of my animals.

406
00:30:00,766 --> 00:30:03,758
But one day.
Everything changed.

407
00:30:03,836 --> 00:30:06,805
That was the day
the men came and took me away.

408
00:30:09,842 --> 00:30:12,640
Whoa, wait a minute.
They kidnapped you?

409
00:30:12,711 --> 00:30:13,837
Yes.

410
00:30:13,913 --> 00:30:16,279
It was that man
in the dark glasses.

411
00:30:16,348 --> 00:30:17,781
I wonder who that guy is...

412
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:19,750
and what
he's doing with the army.

413
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:24,121
I think Dola and that man
are both after your necklace.

414
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,919
I think you're right,
but I had no idea...

415
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:28,755
my crystal was
so incredibly powerful.

416
00:30:28,828 --> 00:30:32,889
It's been in my family
as long as I can remember.

417
00:30:32,965 --> 00:30:35,399
Mother gave it to me
before she died...

418
00:30:35,468 --> 00:30:37,129
and she told me
never to show it...

419
00:30:37,203 --> 00:30:39,000
or give it away to anyone.

420
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:40,971
Huh.

421
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:44,574
We orphans should stick
together, don't you think?

422
00:30:44,643 --> 00:30:46,167
I'm really sorry.

423
00:30:46,245 --> 00:30:48,736
It's my fault getting you
mixed up in all this.

424
00:30:48,814 --> 00:30:50,247
Are you kidding?

425
00:30:50,316 --> 00:30:52,045
This is the most exciting thing
that's ever happened to me.

426
00:30:52,117 --> 00:30:54,847
I wouldn't miss an adventure
like this for the world!

427
00:30:58,824 --> 00:31:00,451
What?

428
00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:08,025
Who holds such a bright light
before my tired, weak old eyes?

429
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:11,695
Are you some sort of goblin
come to torment me?

430
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:15,900
It's Uncle Pom!
Don't worry. He's a friend.

431
00:31:15,975 --> 00:31:18,705
Uncle Pom,
boy, am I glad to see you!

432
00:31:18,777 --> 00:31:20,904
I can't see you
clearly yet, goblin...

433
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:23,278
but you sound like Pazu.

434
00:31:23,349 --> 00:31:25,374
And if these old eyes
don't deceive me...

435
00:31:25,451 --> 00:31:27,282
there's a she-goblin with you.

436
00:31:27,353 --> 00:31:28,820
There are pirates
chasing us, Uncle Pom.

437
00:31:28,888 --> 00:31:32,016
- Oh?
- The army's right behind them.

438
00:31:32,091 --> 00:31:36,494
Ha ha ha! That sounds
absolutely splendid!

439
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:48,672
The tea is ready.
Help yourself.

440
00:31:48,741 --> 00:31:50,766
Thank you.
This is great.

441
00:31:50,843 --> 00:31:54,108
Don't you get lonely down here
underground, Uncle Pom?

442
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:57,205
Never, my dear.

443
00:31:57,283 --> 00:31:59,012
All of these rocks
are my friends.

444
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,915
They often talk to me.

445
00:32:00,986 --> 00:32:03,887
Since last night, they've been
especially restless.

446
00:32:03,956 --> 00:32:06,948
- The rocks talk to you?
- Oh, yes, Pazu.

447
00:32:07,026 --> 00:32:08,926
The earth
speaks to all of us...

448
00:32:08,994 --> 00:32:11,929
and if we listen.
We can understand.

449
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,664
The rocks speak
in a very small voice.

450
00:32:31,517 --> 00:32:35,044
Huh? Oh, my!

451
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,452
It's glowing!

452
00:32:38,857 --> 00:32:40,324
They're everywhere.

453
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:42,952
- Whoa!
- Unbelievable!

454
00:32:53,372 --> 00:32:55,169
Amazing!

455
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,299
Pazu, look above us!

456
00:32:57,376 --> 00:32:59,105
Huh? Wow!

457
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:08,817
What is this?
What makes this happen?

458
00:33:08,887 --> 00:33:11,583
It was just a hunk of rock
a while ago.

459
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:13,852
Oh, my!

460
00:33:13,926 --> 00:33:16,895
The answer
lies inside these rocks.

461
00:33:16,962 --> 00:33:18,327
Let me show you.

462
00:33:20,532 --> 00:33:22,762
Wow! Pazu, you see?

463
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:24,097
Yeah! What is that?

464
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:26,330
It's a long-forgotten element
called aetherium.

465
00:33:26,405 --> 00:33:27,963
Aetherium?

466
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:32,033
All the rocks around here
contain a bit of aetherium.

467
00:33:32,111 --> 00:33:34,341
Really?

468
00:33:34,413 --> 00:33:38,144
Mankind once knew
how to mine aetherium...

469
00:33:38,217 --> 00:33:40,276
but no longer.

470
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:43,484
Wait!

471
00:33:45,157 --> 00:33:47,125
Look, my stone's glowing!

472
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:50,286
Well, goodness!
Bless my soul!

473
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:52,853
That's a pure
aetherium crystal!

474
00:33:52,931 --> 00:33:54,193
There hasn't been one...

475
00:33:54,266 --> 00:33:58,362
since before
my great-grandfather's time.

476
00:33:58,437 --> 00:34:01,804
No wonder
the rocks were restless.

477
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:04,468
This stone possesses
incredible power.

478
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:07,740
Legend has it
that only the people...

479
00:34:07,813 --> 00:34:09,781
of the floating city
of Laputa...

480
00:34:09,848 --> 00:34:11,213
knew how to make
such crystals.

481
00:34:11,283 --> 00:34:13,251
They made this crystal?

482
00:34:13,318 --> 00:34:17,379
They used aetherium to make
Laputa float in the sky.

483
00:34:17,456 --> 00:34:19,048
I knew Laputa
wasn't just made up!

484
00:34:19,124 --> 00:34:21,718
You see, Sheeta?
It's just like my dad said!

485
00:34:26,165 --> 00:34:28,326
What's the matter?

486
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:32,029
I'm sorry, but would you
put that crystal away?

487
00:34:32,104 --> 00:34:34,436
It's too strong for me.

488
00:34:34,506 --> 00:34:36,838
Oh, sorry.

489
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:38,774
What is it, Uncle Pom?

490
00:34:38,844 --> 00:34:43,076
It's speaking too loudly to me.
Too sadly.

491
00:34:48,687 --> 00:34:53,590
Great-grandpa used to tell me
the rocks become restless...

492
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:56,651
when Laputa
appears over the mine.

493
00:34:56,729 --> 00:34:58,162
Wow! So that must mean...

494
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:00,061
Laputa's over the mine
right now!

495
00:35:00,132 --> 00:35:03,124
Sheeta, now I can prove
that the legend is true!

496
00:35:03,202 --> 00:35:06,603
Sheeta, I must tell you
something.

497
00:35:06,672 --> 00:35:07,866
Yes?

498
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,908
What is it?

499
00:35:09,975 --> 00:35:13,911
That crystal
is extremely powerful...

500
00:35:13,979 --> 00:35:16,004
but with a power
that rightfully belongs...

501
00:35:16,081 --> 00:35:18,777
to the earth
from which it came.

502
00:35:18,851 --> 00:35:21,081
To forget that,
and then to try to use...

503
00:35:21,153 --> 00:35:22,882
the crystal's power
for selfish reasons...

504
00:35:22,955 --> 00:35:25,287
will bring great unhappiness.

505
00:35:25,357 --> 00:35:26,949
- You understand?
- Yes.

506
00:35:27,025 --> 00:35:31,553
Your crystal should remind us
that we come from the earth...

507
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,962
and to the earth
we must return.

508
00:35:34,032 --> 00:35:36,660
Come on, lighten up!

509
00:35:36,735 --> 00:35:38,134
Two times already,
that crystal's gotten Sheeta...

510
00:35:38,203 --> 00:35:39,966
out of some really big trouble.

511
00:35:40,038 --> 00:35:41,630
And I have a feeling...

512
00:35:41,707 --> 00:35:43,971
that crystal's gonna
help us find Laputa.

513
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:53,409
It's flying away!

514
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:55,817
Mom, can we go back
to the ship now, please?

515
00:35:55,888 --> 00:35:57,480
It's too quiet.

516
00:35:57,556 --> 00:35:59,421
We better just stay put
for the time being.

517
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:01,652
Now quit whining.

518
00:36:01,727 --> 00:36:03,752
Does this mean no lunch?

519
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:07,765
The coast is clear.
Let's go.

520
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:09,630
Uncle Pom, thank you.

521
00:36:09,701 --> 00:36:12,226
Be careful, my dear.

522
00:36:16,375 --> 00:36:18,434
Be very careful.

523
00:36:30,656 --> 00:36:33,648
Wow, look up there!

524
00:36:33,725 --> 00:36:37,388
That cloud--
it's gigantic!

525
00:36:48,307 --> 00:36:50,332
Beyond that cloud
is a floating city...

526
00:36:50,409 --> 00:36:55,039
that no one here on earth
believes exists.

527
00:36:55,113 --> 00:36:59,140
But I swear--I am going
to be the one to prove it!

528
00:36:59,218 --> 00:37:00,617
- Pazu?
- Huh?

529
00:37:00,686 --> 00:37:04,554
Listen, there's something
I haven't told you yet.

530
00:37:04,623 --> 00:37:07,786
My family has a very old
traditional name...

531
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:10,488
and when the stone
was passed on to me...

532
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:12,689
I inherited that name.

533
00:37:12,764 --> 00:37:17,701
And the name I inherited was
Lusheeta Toel Ul Laputa.

534
00:37:19,538 --> 00:37:22,029
Laputa? You mean you're...

535
00:37:25,677 --> 00:37:28,043
They found us, Sheeta!
Let's go!

536
00:37:28,113 --> 00:37:31,276
- Unh!
- Come on!

537
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:34,410
- Head back to the mine!
- Stop them!

538
00:37:34,486 --> 00:37:37,182
- Unh!
- Aah!

539
00:37:37,256 --> 00:37:38,587
Hands up!

540
00:37:38,657 --> 00:37:39,589
Don't you touch her!

541
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:45,426
- Let me go!
- Aah!

542
00:37:45,497 --> 00:37:47,294
Oh, no!
Are you all right, Pazu?

543
00:37:47,366 --> 00:37:49,061
You have to wake up, Pazu!

544
00:37:50,535 --> 00:37:53,299
- Sir, we've captured them.
- And about time.

545
00:38:17,963 --> 00:38:20,363
Ohh!

546
00:38:20,432 --> 00:38:21,558
Huh?

547
00:38:26,872 --> 00:38:29,500
Huh? Hey, let me out!

548
00:38:29,574 --> 00:38:30,905
Unh!

549
00:38:32,244 --> 00:38:33,575
Unh!

550
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:36,705
Where am I?

551
00:38:38,417 --> 00:38:40,510
Unh!

552
00:38:40,585 --> 00:38:42,780
Forward, march!

553
00:38:57,035 --> 00:38:58,332
Aah!

554
00:39:06,745 --> 00:39:08,576
This is a delicate situation.

555
00:39:08,647 --> 00:39:10,740
She's young, vulnerable.

556
00:39:10,816 --> 00:39:13,649
We'll get what we want.
But it will take time.

557
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:15,016
We're wasting time!

558
00:39:15,087 --> 00:39:18,818
You twist an arm or two, and
I guarantee the girl will talk.

559
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:21,017
I respectfully disagree.

560
00:39:21,093 --> 00:39:24,790
Such military tactics risk
wasting more time, general.

561
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:28,264
If my military tactics
had been used to begin with...

562
00:39:28,333 --> 00:39:30,528
Dola wouldn't have had a chance
to interfere with us at all!

563
00:39:30,602 --> 00:39:35,164
It was a military transmission
that the pirates decoded.

564
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:38,141
You've bungled things, sir.
And now I must fix them.

565
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:40,508
Your job, general...

566
00:39:40,579 --> 00:39:43,139
is to mobilize the troops
when it becomes necessary.

567
00:39:44,182 --> 00:39:46,616
Muska, just don't forget...

568
00:39:46,685 --> 00:39:48,880
that the government put me
in charge of finding Laputa!

569
00:39:48,954 --> 00:39:51,889
Don't forget that as
the government's secret agent...

570
00:39:51,957 --> 00:39:54,585
I am in charge of you, general.

571
00:39:57,162 --> 00:40:00,325
Blast.
I really hate that man.

572
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:13,670
Huh?

573
00:40:17,816 --> 00:40:18,908
I trust you slept well?

574
00:40:18,984 --> 00:40:21,578
Where is Pazu? Is he
all right? I want to see him!

575
00:40:21,653 --> 00:40:23,746
Now, this is fit for a princess.

576
00:40:23,822 --> 00:40:25,722
Don't worry, Sheeta.

577
00:40:25,791 --> 00:40:29,522
Your friend is being treated as
if he were the guest of royalty.

578
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:32,529
I want you to see something
before you see him.

579
00:40:47,012 --> 00:40:48,707
Please step inside.

580
00:40:51,883 --> 00:40:53,510
Look there.

581
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:08,527
What is it?

582
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,160
An artificial life form.

583
00:41:11,236 --> 00:41:12,760
It's called a robot.

584
00:41:12,838 --> 00:41:15,966
Laputa was just a legend
till this dropped from the sky.

585
00:41:21,012 --> 00:41:22,138
Huh?

586
00:41:22,214 --> 00:41:24,444
- Aah!
- Oh! Ohh!

587
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:33,421
Now the government wants me...

588
00:41:33,492 --> 00:41:35,483
to unlock Laputa's secrets.

589
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:38,859
For example, what's this fellow
made of--metal or ceramics?

590
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:41,763
With our limited technology,
we have no idea.

591
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,664
But he does tell us one thing.

592
00:41:43,735 --> 00:41:45,669
Come and see.

593
00:41:45,737 --> 00:41:49,468
Don't be afraid, Sheeta. He's
really quite dead, you know.

594
00:41:56,148 --> 00:41:57,479
Look there.

595
00:42:01,353 --> 00:42:03,014
Yes.

596
00:42:03,088 --> 00:42:04,555
It's the same emblem...

597
00:42:04,623 --> 00:42:07,148
that decorates the fireplace
in your home.

598
00:42:07,225 --> 00:42:09,022
And your crystal.

599
00:42:09,094 --> 00:42:13,190
You see, Sheeta, this crystal
also comes from Laputa.

600
00:42:16,001 --> 00:42:18,469
And I believe the powers
locked inside it...

601
00:42:18,537 --> 00:42:22,029
are capable of leading a person
back to that city's treasures.

602
00:42:22,107 --> 00:42:25,042
Then why?
Why don't you just take it?

603
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:27,670
Just take it and keep Laputa's
treasures for yourself...

604
00:42:27,746 --> 00:42:31,182
but leave Pazu and me alone,
please!

605
00:42:31,249 --> 00:42:34,446
Oh, you really are
being very silly about this.

606
00:42:34,519 --> 00:42:35,747
You think I'm doing this
for money?

607
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:37,481
You understand nothing.

608
00:42:37,556 --> 00:42:40,491
According to the legend,
the same technology...

609
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:43,084
that kept Laputa airborne
also made it...

610
00:42:43,161 --> 00:42:47,598
a major power that once
dominated the entire planet.

611
00:42:47,666 --> 00:42:51,033
If such a horrible thing
is still floating up there...

612
00:42:51,102 --> 00:42:52,729
you can understand
what a threat it is...

613
00:42:52,804 --> 00:42:54,533
to the peace of the world.

614
00:42:54,606 --> 00:42:58,804
Sheeta,
the stone only works for you.

615
00:42:58,877 --> 00:43:01,710
You must know of some way
to make the stone...

616
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:04,044
point out
the location of Laputa.

617
00:43:04,115 --> 00:43:08,575
I really don't know anything.
Please let me see Pazu!

618
00:43:08,653 --> 00:43:11,850
I don't want to see
any harm come to anyone...

619
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:15,120
but I simply can't control what
the military might do to him.

620
00:43:15,193 --> 00:43:17,058
What?!

621
00:43:17,128 --> 00:43:19,255
In the event
that you cooperate...

622
00:43:19,331 --> 00:43:22,732
I'm sure whosever is in charge
will grant Pazu his freedom...

623
00:43:22,801 --> 00:43:27,238
Lusheeta Toel Ul Laputa.

624
00:43:27,305 --> 00:43:29,068
You know my real name.

625
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:32,337
"Ul" means "ruler" in Laputian.
"Toel" means "true."

626
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:34,378
You are the legitimate heir...

627
00:43:34,446 --> 00:43:37,074
to the throne of Laputa,
Princess Lusheeta.

628
00:43:50,729 --> 00:43:52,253
Aah!

629
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:53,991
Unh!

630
00:43:57,102 --> 00:43:58,262
Let's go! Out!

631
00:44:00,672 --> 00:44:02,264
Sheeta!

632
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:04,240
Are you all right, Pazu?

633
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:07,210
I'm OK, but what about you?
They didn't hurt you, did they?

634
00:44:07,279 --> 00:44:10,578
Pazu, I'm so sorry. There's
been a grave misunderstanding.

635
00:44:10,649 --> 00:44:13,584
We had no idea
how nobly you fought...

636
00:44:13,652 --> 00:44:16,587
to protect our little Sheeta
from those awful pirates.

637
00:44:16,655 --> 00:44:18,088
What's he talking about?

638
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:22,024
Pazu, do this for me.
Forget about Laputa.

639
00:44:22,093 --> 00:44:23,856
What are you saying?

640
00:44:23,928 --> 00:44:26,158
It's been decided
that the search for Laputa...

641
00:44:26,231 --> 00:44:28,062
will be made secretly
by the army...

642
00:44:28,133 --> 00:44:29,691
with Sheeta's cooperation.

643
00:44:29,768 --> 00:44:30,996
Really, the best thing
you can do...

644
00:44:31,069 --> 00:44:33,094
is forget
you ever heard of the place.

645
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:35,105
Forget about Laputa?

646
00:44:35,173 --> 00:44:37,664
I'm sorry I caused you
so much trouble.

647
00:44:37,742 --> 00:44:40,142
I hope someday
you can forgive me.

648
00:44:40,211 --> 00:44:42,145
I can't forget! No way!

649
00:44:42,213 --> 00:44:44,613
Laputa means too much
to both of us!

650
00:44:44,683 --> 00:44:46,844
- Good-bye!
- Sheeta!

651
00:44:46,918 --> 00:44:48,783
Aah! Come back!

652
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:50,844
Now, behave, little boy.
Use your head!

653
00:45:01,299 --> 00:45:04,097
Here, take this--
a little something...

654
00:45:04,169 --> 00:45:07,263
to show our appreciation
of your efforts.

655
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:44,233
Only you can do it.

656
00:45:44,309 --> 00:45:47,801
Remember the words
that bring the crystal to life.

657
00:45:47,879 --> 00:45:50,780
Keep your promise,
and you too will be free.

658
00:46:09,167 --> 00:46:12,159
Get out, piggy! Get out!

659
00:46:12,237 --> 00:46:14,899
Unh! Huh?

660
00:46:17,942 --> 00:46:22,572
Hey, mommy! Mommy, it's Pazu!
Pazu's outside!

661
00:46:22,647 --> 00:46:25,810
Oh, my! Pazu!

662
00:46:25,884 --> 00:46:28,216
Where have you been?

663
00:46:28,286 --> 00:46:29,810
We were all very worried
about you, Pazu.

664
00:46:29,888 --> 00:46:32,550
What happened to your friend?

665
00:46:32,624 --> 00:46:35,821
- It's over now.
- What?

666
00:46:35,894 --> 00:46:37,555
Pazu! Come back!

667
00:46:43,435 --> 00:46:44,800
Unh!

668
00:47:08,726 --> 00:47:11,422
Well, ahoy there, matey!

669
00:47:11,496 --> 00:47:13,930
What's going on?

670
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:16,432
Stop wiggling,
you little worm!

671
00:47:16,501 --> 00:47:18,298
Welcome home, sonny.

672
00:47:18,369 --> 00:47:21,998
Get out! Aah!
Get out, or I'll throw you out!

673
00:47:22,073 --> 00:47:23,700
This is my house!

674
00:47:23,775 --> 00:47:26,903
Oh, you don't scare me.

675
00:47:26,978 --> 00:47:29,344
You can't even protect
one small girl!

676
00:47:29,414 --> 00:47:30,506
What do you mean?

677
00:47:30,582 --> 00:47:32,015
Hey, Mom,
can I keep this money?

678
00:47:32,083 --> 00:47:35,610
Up and sold the little girl,
did you? I know your type.

679
00:47:35,687 --> 00:47:37,484
You don't know
what you're talking about!

680
00:47:37,555 --> 00:47:40,183
They offered you money,
and you took it, didn't you?

681
00:47:40,258 --> 00:47:43,694
I only left
because Sheeta told me to!

682
00:47:43,761 --> 00:47:45,058
That's why.

683
00:47:45,129 --> 00:47:49,862
So, you believed her,
and you came back here, right?

684
00:47:49,934 --> 00:47:52,402
You're just a scared little boy
who runs away!

685
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:54,097
Says you!

686
00:47:54,172 --> 00:47:56,402
You don't even have the guts to
stand up to Muska and the army!

687
00:47:56,474 --> 00:48:01,411
He who turns and runs away can
steal the treasure another day!

688
00:48:01,479 --> 00:48:02,571
So true.

689
00:48:02,647 --> 00:48:03,909
Don't you think
it's kind of strange...

690
00:48:03,982 --> 00:48:07,383
that the army's gotten into
the kidnapping business?

691
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:12,155
Do you really think
they'll keep her alive?

692
00:48:12,223 --> 00:48:14,418
Don't you see that
they forced her to make a deal?

693
00:48:14,492 --> 00:48:16,926
Huh?

694
00:48:19,931 --> 00:48:23,833
She saved your life. Get it?

695
00:48:25,503 --> 00:48:28,097
Mommy, you amaze me.
How do you know these things?

696
00:48:28,172 --> 00:48:31,005
Well, you can't be
a sensitive woman like me...

697
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:32,770
without leaning a few things.

698
00:48:32,844 --> 00:48:34,573
Sheeta and I
are exactly alike--

699
00:48:34,646 --> 00:48:37,444
all warm and mushy
and sensitive.

700
00:48:37,515 --> 00:48:39,574
Now, so when you boys
get married...

701
00:48:39,651 --> 00:48:41,209
You go find a gal like her.

702
00:48:41,286 --> 00:48:44,278
Huh?
She's gonna end up like mama?

703
00:48:44,355 --> 00:48:45,447
Good question.

704
00:48:45,523 --> 00:48:47,457
Oh, boy!

705
00:48:47,525 --> 00:48:50,392
Finally!

706
00:48:50,461 --> 00:48:53,453
- Aw, Mom, that was--
- The ham! Gimme that!

707
00:48:53,531 --> 00:48:55,624
Hmm.

708
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:59,966
Well, it won't work
changing the code on me.

709
00:49:00,038 --> 00:49:02,336
They're calling
for air destroyer Goliath.

710
00:49:11,215 --> 00:49:12,978
They're planning
to take off with Sheeta.

711
00:49:13,051 --> 00:49:15,383
We've got to hurry,
or it'll be too late!

712
00:49:15,453 --> 00:49:17,978
Come on, boys! Stop eating!

713
00:49:18,056 --> 00:49:20,388
I'm going!

714
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:23,052
Wait! Are you going
to rescue Sheeta?

715
00:49:23,127 --> 00:49:25,823
No, you little squirt.
We want her crystal.

716
00:49:25,897 --> 00:49:27,057
Wait a minute!
You've got to have Sheeta...

717
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:28,462
to make
the aetherium crystal work.

718
00:49:28,533 --> 00:49:29,625
Otherwise, it's useless!

719
00:49:29,701 --> 00:49:32,636
Please let me come with you!
I need to save her!

720
00:49:32,704 --> 00:49:34,638
Sheeta means everything to me.

721
00:49:34,706 --> 00:49:36,139
You know something?

722
00:49:36,207 --> 00:49:38,641
You're acting like
a sniveling little crybaby.

723
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:41,008
Maybe you're right. I should
have protected Sheeta...

724
00:49:41,079 --> 00:49:42,979
but instead,
I was stupid and angry.

725
00:49:43,047 --> 00:49:44,139
But let me come with you...

726
00:49:44,215 --> 00:49:45,307
and I swear
I'll protect her this time!

727
00:49:45,383 --> 00:49:47,146
Pazu loves Sheeta

728
00:49:47,218 --> 00:49:49,243
- Be quiet!
- Sorry, Mom.

729
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,345
Hmm.

730
00:49:55,560 --> 00:50:00,088
Guess you'll be useful in
getting Sheeta to cooperate.

731
00:50:00,164 --> 00:50:02,997
You might never
come back here again, Pazu.

732
00:50:03,067 --> 00:50:04,159
I know.

733
00:50:04,235 --> 00:50:06,135
- Ready for what might happen?
- Mm-hmm.

734
00:50:07,672 --> 00:50:10,140
We leave here in one minute!

735
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:21,011
Now, you guys be good.

736
00:50:28,092 --> 00:50:30,390
- Here, fasten this.
- Right!

737
00:50:30,461 --> 00:50:32,363
Let's rendezvous
at the Tiger Moth.

738
00:51:04,195 --> 00:51:06,220
What a superb ship!

739
00:51:06,297 --> 00:51:08,788
Muska, has the girl
surrendered the information?

740
00:51:08,866 --> 00:51:10,197
It will take a little more time.

741
00:51:10,268 --> 00:51:11,895
More time?

742
00:51:11,969 --> 00:51:13,994
Well, you'll have plenty
of that aboard Goliath.

743
00:51:14,072 --> 00:51:16,267
We set out with her
at first light.

744
00:51:36,928 --> 00:51:39,920
Hurry! We have to get there
before sun up!

745
00:51:45,803 --> 00:51:46,929
Sheeta.

746
00:52:11,162 --> 00:52:13,960
Well, well, now,
what shall we do?

747
00:52:15,967 --> 00:52:20,734
Sheeta, maybe grandma
should teach you a spell--

748
00:52:20,805 --> 00:52:23,365
one that will help you
when you're in trouble.

749
00:52:23,441 --> 00:52:24,931
A spell?

750
00:52:25,009 --> 00:52:27,910
Yes, my dearest.
An ancient secret spell.

751
00:52:27,979 --> 00:52:33,918
Leetay latuparita ulus
arialos balu netoreel.

752
00:52:33,985 --> 00:52:36,920
Leetay a...

753
00:52:36,988 --> 00:52:39,684
The words mean "save me."

754
00:52:39,757 --> 00:52:43,693
"Save me
and revive the eternal light."

755
00:52:43,761 --> 00:52:48,357
So, leetay latuparita ulus
arialos balu netoreel.

756
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:52,398
Leetay latuparita ulus...

757
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:54,961
arialos balu netoreel.

758
00:53:00,578 --> 00:53:02,910
Aah! Aah!

759
00:53:07,185 --> 00:53:09,415
Aah!

760
00:53:17,628 --> 00:53:21,064
Ahh. I knew it!

761
00:53:27,738 --> 00:53:29,467
It's the sacred light!

762
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:32,338
The ancient documents were true!
It's not just a legend!

763
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:34,503
What are you talking about?

764
00:53:34,579 --> 00:53:36,945
Aaah!

765
00:53:37,014 --> 00:53:38,948
Oh!

766
00:53:39,016 --> 00:53:42,452
Tell me the spell!
What are the secret words?

767
00:53:51,462 --> 00:53:54,124
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

768
00:53:55,399 --> 00:53:57,299
OK, open it up.

769
00:53:59,036 --> 00:54:00,901
- Huh?
- Huh?

770
00:54:04,842 --> 00:54:06,639
Get outta there!

771
00:54:10,448 --> 00:54:12,382
I'm telling you,
this thing is alive!

772
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:15,385
Do you hear me? Alive!

773
00:54:20,091 --> 00:54:21,456
What?

774
00:54:23,728 --> 00:54:27,129
Help, it's alive!
And it's after us!

775
00:54:27,198 --> 00:54:30,361
- Run for your lives!
- It's the robot! Go! Run!

776
00:54:34,205 --> 00:54:36,196
It's come back to life!

777
00:54:36,274 --> 00:54:40,233
Hurry! Hurry! Sound the alarm!
Quick! Quick!

778
00:54:40,311 --> 00:54:42,438
He's moving!

779
00:54:44,315 --> 00:54:47,751
- What's happening?
- Sir, it's the robot.

780
00:54:57,695 --> 00:54:59,629
It's coming toward us!

781
00:55:04,368 --> 00:55:07,132
Shut the fire door! Hurry!

782
00:55:11,575 --> 00:55:13,202
- Pull back!
- Look out!

783
00:55:16,681 --> 00:55:18,615
- Aah!
- The power!

784
00:55:25,690 --> 00:55:28,250
Yes, I understand.

785
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,250
It's your crystal.

786
00:55:31,329 --> 00:55:33,058
The force
of the sacred light...

787
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:34,757
has brought the robot
back to life!

788
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:37,392
The way to Laputa
has been opened!

789
00:55:37,468 --> 00:55:39,959
Let me go!

790
00:55:42,707 --> 00:55:44,265
- Ohh!
- Unh!

791
00:55:47,345 --> 00:55:49,142
Aah!

792
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:00,816
It's going to fly!

793
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:10,494
Aah!

794
00:56:18,275 --> 00:56:19,401
Oh!

795
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:31,513
Oh! Oh!

796
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:49,105
Oh! Oh!

797
00:56:53,244 --> 00:56:55,735
It's Laputa.

798
00:56:59,617 --> 00:57:03,018
Finally.
I now know the way to Laputa.

799
00:57:03,087 --> 00:57:04,952
Hurry! No time to waste!

800
00:57:05,022 --> 00:57:06,512
What do you mean, robot?

801
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:08,524
I want to know who's trying
to blow up my fortress!

802
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,854
Are you there?
Somebody answer me now!

803
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:15,865
- We're ready.
- You're connected now, Colonel.

804
00:57:15,933 --> 00:57:18,527
This is Colonel Muska.
We have an emergency.

805
00:57:18,602 --> 00:57:20,092
You'll take your orders
from me now.

806
00:57:20,171 --> 00:57:21,604
Huh?

807
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:39,555
Hurry! I need that shell now!

808
00:57:45,629 --> 00:57:46,755
No!

809
00:58:00,177 --> 00:58:01,303
- Fire!
- Fire!

810
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:05,239
Aah!

811
00:58:19,163 --> 00:58:21,461
Let's get up there now!

812
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:25,601
- We demolished it!
- We got him!

813
00:58:25,669 --> 00:58:26,966
Go get the girl!

814
00:58:27,037 --> 00:58:28,436
- Over there!
- Yes, sir.

815
00:58:28,506 --> 00:58:30,371
Make sure
it doesn't move, now.

816
00:58:30,441 --> 00:58:32,841
Is she dead?

817
00:58:32,910 --> 00:58:34,537
Hey, get up.

818
00:58:35,779 --> 00:58:38,145
Nah, she's only fainted.

819
00:58:38,215 --> 00:58:39,307
- Come on.
- Oh, no!

820
00:58:50,427 --> 00:58:51,689
Aah!

821
00:59:25,329 --> 00:59:27,422
Huh? Look!

822
00:59:27,498 --> 00:59:29,261
Criminey!

823
00:59:29,333 --> 00:59:30,925
Would you look at that?

824
00:59:31,001 --> 00:59:33,094
Must be some kind of war
goin' on!

825
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:35,832
- Take her down, Dola!
- Call me captain!

826
00:59:35,906 --> 00:59:38,374
Whee!

827
00:59:38,442 --> 00:59:39,841
Ha ha ha!

828
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:41,878
Hey, mom, what's the plan?

829
00:59:41,946 --> 00:59:44,073
Just keep your big head down,
Shalulu!

830
00:59:58,462 --> 01:00:00,453
Huh?

831
01:00:02,866 --> 01:00:05,096
Stop it!
You're destroying everything!

832
01:00:05,169 --> 01:00:07,103
Please, stop!

833
01:00:15,212 --> 01:00:18,147
Captain Mother, Goliath
is moving! Goliath is moving!

834
01:00:24,521 --> 01:00:27,922
If we stay on this heading,
we'll be in the line of fire.

835
01:00:27,992 --> 01:00:29,550
- Change course!
- Look! There she is!

836
01:00:29,627 --> 01:00:30,753
- It's Sheeta!
- What?

837
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:35,326
- Where'd you see her?
- Steady as she goes, captain!

838
01:00:35,399 --> 01:00:37,799
She's on top of that tower!

839
01:00:45,643 --> 01:00:47,804
One for all and all for mom!

840
01:00:47,878 --> 01:00:49,573
- Cover me!
- Good luck!

841
01:01:00,891 --> 01:01:03,655
Sheeta!

842
01:01:04,928 --> 01:01:06,953
My hand--take it!

843
01:01:07,031 --> 01:01:08,760
Pazu!

844
01:01:10,167 --> 01:01:12,499
I've gotta get in
a little closer, Dola!

845
01:01:12,569 --> 01:01:16,005
Aah! Uhh!

846
01:01:16,073 --> 01:01:18,337
Pazu!

847
01:01:18,409 --> 01:01:22,539
But they're here to help me!
Please, put me down!

848
01:01:31,055 --> 01:01:33,489
Aah!

849
01:01:40,931 --> 01:01:42,865
Sheeta!

850
01:01:42,933 --> 01:01:44,696
Uhh!

851
01:01:45,969 --> 01:01:47,960
Dola!

852
01:01:48,038 --> 01:01:50,802
Aaaah!

853
01:01:50,874 --> 01:01:52,842
No! They're falling!

854
01:02:00,117 --> 01:02:03,052
No.

855
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:04,417
Help!

856
01:02:11,228 --> 01:02:12,388
Come on!

857
01:02:24,341 --> 01:02:26,832
Oh, come on, pull up!

858
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:28,172
Uhh!

859
01:02:32,349 --> 01:02:33,782
It's now or never, Pazu.

860
01:02:33,851 --> 01:02:35,284
I'll take us in,
and you grab her.

861
01:02:35,352 --> 01:02:36,649
Right!

862
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:38,210
Over here!

863
01:02:38,288 --> 01:02:40,586
- OK, captain!
- Go!

864
01:02:42,192 --> 01:02:44,285
What are you doing? Fools!
Don't let her escape!

865
01:02:44,361 --> 01:02:46,556
Aaah!

866
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:47,790
Gotcha!

867
01:02:47,865 --> 01:02:50,629
Hang on, girlie girl!
Ha ha ha!

868
01:02:50,701 --> 01:02:54,137
An entire army,
and they're getting away!

869
01:02:54,204 --> 01:02:57,571
Here's smoke
in your eye! Ha ha!

870
01:02:57,641 --> 01:02:59,632
A smoke screen.

871
01:02:59,710 --> 01:03:01,234
It's not over.

872
01:03:04,314 --> 01:03:07,181
- All right!
- Yow!

873
01:03:14,057 --> 01:03:17,458
Muska, Muska! What on earth
happened to the robot?

874
01:03:17,528 --> 01:03:19,860
We destroyed it,
and the girl's gone.

875
01:03:19,930 --> 01:03:22,057
What?! Ohh!

876
01:03:22,132 --> 01:03:24,623
Look at this. It's a disaster.

877
01:03:24,701 --> 01:03:27,602
I think we may have found
what you've been looking for.

878
01:03:27,671 --> 01:03:30,799
Extinguish the fire!
Organize a pursuit team!

879
01:03:30,874 --> 01:03:33,138
Right there, sir.

880
01:03:43,220 --> 01:03:47,850
It still possesses
its sacred light...

881
01:03:48,892 --> 01:03:52,055
pointing to Laputa.

882
01:03:52,129 --> 01:03:54,324
You may now go tell
the general for me...

883
01:03:54,398 --> 01:03:56,161
we will be departing on time.

884
01:04:34,137 --> 01:04:35,468
Sheeta, you OK?

885
01:04:35,539 --> 01:04:37,302
If I did something wrong...

886
01:04:37,374 --> 01:04:39,968
I'd really like
to apologize for it, Sheeta.

887
01:04:40,043 --> 01:04:41,738
We all did
something wrong...

888
01:04:41,812 --> 01:04:43,973
wastin' our time
on these two kids.

889
01:04:44,047 --> 01:04:46,413
Here's your valley up ahead.

890
01:04:46,483 --> 01:04:48,474
I'll drop you off there,
and that'll be that.

891
01:04:48,552 --> 01:04:49,849
Fine.

892
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:52,855
Dola, will you let us sail
with you and the boys?

893
01:04:52,923 --> 01:04:54,618
Call me captain, darn it!

894
01:04:54,691 --> 01:04:56,522
I don't see what the heck's
in it for me...

895
01:04:56,593 --> 01:04:58,060
since you've lost
the aetherium crystal!

896
01:04:58,128 --> 01:04:59,891
We can work.

897
01:04:59,963 --> 01:05:01,692
And I have to find out
the real truth...

898
01:05:01,765 --> 01:05:04,393
about Laputa for myself,
captain.

899
01:05:09,106 --> 01:05:11,734
So, you're not interested
in money...

900
01:05:11,808 --> 01:05:14,038
but you want to find out
the truth about Laputa.

901
01:05:14,111 --> 01:05:15,806
Heh heh. Well, I guess
there's worse reasons...

902
01:05:15,879 --> 01:05:17,471
for you wanting
to become a pirate.

903
01:05:17,548 --> 01:05:19,345
Mother,
I say let 'em come along.

904
01:05:19,416 --> 01:05:22,442
Tow the line and
work hard, or overboard you go.

905
01:05:22,519 --> 01:05:23,611
Yes, captain.

906
01:05:23,687 --> 01:05:25,985
Yes! No more
swabbin' the decks! Hooray!

907
01:05:26,056 --> 01:05:27,455
I won't have
to wash the dishes!

908
01:05:27,524 --> 01:05:30,891
I've peeled my last potato!
Yee-haw!

909
01:05:30,961 --> 01:05:34,727
- Whoopee!
- Whee!

910
01:05:34,798 --> 01:05:36,732
Sheeta, can you make pudding?

911
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:38,062
I love pudding!

912
01:05:38,135 --> 01:05:40,228
I get to lick the spatula!

913
01:05:40,304 --> 01:05:42,295
And I like chocolate cake
with that--

914
01:05:42,372 --> 01:05:44,237
Oh, what's that frosting?
It's kind of pink and swirly.

915
01:05:44,308 --> 01:05:47,436
Will you shut up?
Ah, what can I tell you?

916
01:05:47,511 --> 01:05:48,978
They just really like dessert.

917
01:05:54,318 --> 01:05:56,980
Look. Pazu. Look.
It's your house.

918
01:05:57,054 --> 01:05:59,989
Ohh, your birds.
Will they be all right?

919
01:06:00,057 --> 01:06:03,026
Yeah, they'll be fine.

920
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:25,014
There she is!

921
01:06:25,082 --> 01:06:28,017
Ahoy! Captain!

922
01:06:28,085 --> 01:06:30,952
Steady, steady!

923
01:06:34,091 --> 01:06:35,786
Whoa!

924
01:06:35,859 --> 01:06:37,190
And disembark.

925
01:06:39,496 --> 01:06:42,988
Uhh! Wow, what is this ship
made out of, cloth?

926
01:06:43,066 --> 01:06:44,260
And don't you rip it!

927
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:45,426
- Uhh!
- Uhh!

928
01:06:45,502 --> 01:06:47,470
Come on, we'll go topside.

929
01:06:51,608 --> 01:06:52,870
Ohh!

930
01:06:54,344 --> 01:06:56,209
You're goin'
the wrong way! Come here!

931
01:06:56,279 --> 01:06:57,576
I don't like slow-pokes!

932
01:06:57,648 --> 01:06:58,910
I'm not a slow-poke!
The wind was just--

933
01:06:58,982 --> 01:07:00,643
You come this way.

934
01:07:00,717 --> 01:07:02,082
- Ohh!
- Pazu?

935
01:07:02,152 --> 01:07:03,710
Come on, matey.
I haven't got all day.

936
01:07:03,787 --> 01:07:05,880
Work, work, work.
Busy, busy, busy, busy.

937
01:07:05,956 --> 01:07:08,288
Left, right, left, right.
You're not here to have fun.

938
01:07:08,358 --> 01:07:09,916
As you can see.
This room's loaded...

939
01:07:09,993 --> 01:07:11,290
with all sorts of gears
and gizmoes.

940
01:07:11,361 --> 01:07:13,727
Whoa. This engine room
is really amazing.

941
01:07:13,797 --> 01:07:15,560
Is that what it's called?

942
01:07:15,632 --> 01:07:18,123
Hey, papa! Where are you?!

943
01:07:18,201 --> 01:07:19,395
Oh!

944
01:07:19,469 --> 01:07:23,132
Hey, pop, I finally found you
an assistant!

945
01:07:23,206 --> 01:07:25,800
Stop yelling at me!
I can hear you!

946
01:07:25,876 --> 01:07:27,673
Believe me,
sometimes I wish I couldn't.

947
01:07:27,744 --> 01:07:29,507
Come on, assistant,
let's see what you can do.

948
01:07:29,579 --> 01:07:32,742
Uh, hurry up. He is
even tougher than my mother.

949
01:07:32,816 --> 01:07:34,750
I need someone
who's mechanically minded.

950
01:07:34,818 --> 01:07:36,479
Not some half-baked.
Swashbuckling...

951
01:07:36,553 --> 01:07:38,180
Casanova wannabe.

952
01:07:40,624 --> 01:07:42,387
It's too narrow. I can't reach.

953
01:07:42,459 --> 01:07:43,790
It's OK. I got it.

954
01:07:43,860 --> 01:07:45,088
- What's your name?
- Pazu.

955
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:51,223
But the beam from the crystal
was pointing directly due east.

956
01:07:51,301 --> 01:07:53,166
Are you sure about this?

957
01:07:53,236 --> 01:07:56,603
Yes, I'm sure I could see
the sun rising from the tower.

958
01:07:56,673 --> 01:07:58,903
You know, it's the end
of grass-cutting season...

959
01:07:58,975 --> 01:08:00,909
so the sun rose
not from due east...

960
01:08:00,977 --> 01:08:02,569
but a little further south.

961
01:08:02,646 --> 01:08:04,580
The light was pointing
to the left of the hill...

962
01:08:04,648 --> 01:08:06,377
from which the sun rose,
you see?

963
01:08:06,450 --> 01:08:08,680
Pretty smart.
Found anything yet?

964
01:08:08,752 --> 01:08:10,879
Haven't found a single thing,
captain.

965
01:08:10,954 --> 01:08:12,216
They're
jamming the airwaves...

966
01:08:12,289 --> 01:08:14,223
so we can't find 'em.
The flying devils.

967
01:08:14,291 --> 01:08:17,283
Mom, how can we catch them when
they're faster than we are?

968
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:20,420
It looks like we're cruising
on the windward side of 'em.

969
01:08:20,497 --> 01:08:23,398
So if we manage
to ride the trade wind...

970
01:08:23,467 --> 01:08:26,300
Let's see. According
to my calculations...

971
01:08:26,369 --> 01:08:29,600
with wind velocity at ten...

972
01:08:29,673 --> 01:08:33,109
looks to me
like we'll catch 'em.

973
01:08:33,176 --> 01:08:35,610
Attention, all hands!
Now hear this!

974
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:38,978
Goliath is already underway
for Laputa.

975
01:08:39,049 --> 01:08:41,040
We're gonna set sail
and go after them.

976
01:08:41,118 --> 01:08:42,551
If we can catch the wind...

977
01:08:42,619 --> 01:08:44,814
we'll be on their heels
by tomorrow.

978
01:08:44,888 --> 01:08:48,380
The first man to spy Goliath
will receive ten gold coins.

979
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:49,891
That's good money!

980
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:52,554
And if the stories we've heard
about Laputa are true...

981
01:08:52,629 --> 01:08:53,891
there'll be enough treasure...

982
01:08:53,964 --> 01:08:55,659
to make an honest pirate
of us all.

983
01:08:55,732 --> 01:08:58,667
Ha ha! All right!
All hands aboard!

984
01:08:58,735 --> 01:09:00,794
Look alive and get to work!

985
01:09:00,871 --> 01:09:03,305
Let's show
those military dunderheads...

986
01:09:03,373 --> 01:09:05,773
what the Dola pirate gang
is made of!

987
01:09:07,110 --> 01:09:08,600
Let her rip!

988
01:09:15,352 --> 01:09:18,287
Course, ninety-eight degrees.
Velocity, fifty.

989
01:09:37,107 --> 01:09:39,302
Gotta start talkin'
like a real pirate.

990
01:09:39,376 --> 01:09:40,673
I've been practicing.

991
01:09:40,744 --> 01:09:42,871
Um... argh, matey!

992
01:09:42,946 --> 01:09:44,174
Shiver me timbers.

993
01:09:44,247 --> 01:09:45,942
Keep practicing.

994
01:09:48,185 --> 01:09:51,211
Now you gotta start
dressing like a real pirate.

995
01:09:51,288 --> 01:09:53,848
Let's see... here.

996
01:09:53,924 --> 01:09:55,619
These are really...

997
01:09:55,692 --> 01:09:56,989
- What?
- Nice.

998
01:09:57,060 --> 01:09:59,688
My men, swab the deck,
batten down hatches...

999
01:09:59,763 --> 01:10:01,993
and keep the Tiger Moth
ready for action.

1000
01:10:02,065 --> 01:10:03,999
Wow.

1001
01:10:04,067 --> 01:10:06,695
And this is
where you'll be working.

1002
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:13,801
This is the galley.
I want it shipshape...

1003
01:10:13,877 --> 01:10:16,004
sparkling clean, and
ready for action in one hour.

1004
01:10:16,079 --> 01:10:18,013
- That's an order.
- But I--

1005
01:10:18,081 --> 01:10:21,983
The boys get awful hungry,
so you'll serve 5 meals a day.

1006
01:10:24,955 --> 01:10:26,786
Lookin' for something.
Gentlemen?

1007
01:10:28,959 --> 01:10:31,689
You blubberheads!
I'm not runnin' a luxury cruise!

1008
01:10:31,761 --> 01:10:32,887
Now get to work!

1009
01:10:37,467 --> 01:10:39,230
Mmm.

1010
01:11:01,658 --> 01:11:02,750
Hmm?

1011
01:11:02,826 --> 01:11:04,817
Hmm.

1012
01:11:04,895 --> 01:11:06,021
Hmm?

1013
01:11:24,147 --> 01:11:25,580
Come in.

1014
01:11:28,485 --> 01:11:32,546
I'm afraid I'm still cooking.
Nothing's ready yet.

1015
01:11:32,622 --> 01:11:36,251
It took me a long time
to clean everything up.

1016
01:11:36,326 --> 01:11:39,261
- Ahem.
- Uh, yes? What is it?

1017
01:11:40,997 --> 01:11:42,089
Uh...

1018
01:11:42,165 --> 01:11:43,757
Yes?

1019
01:11:43,833 --> 01:11:45,596
I finished my work
for the moment...

1020
01:11:45,669 --> 01:11:47,660
and I've come to offer you
my help.

1021
01:11:47,737 --> 01:11:49,364
Well, that's kind of you.

1022
01:11:49,439 --> 01:11:51,464
Would you please hand me
those plates over there?

1023
01:11:51,541 --> 01:11:53,771
With pleasure,
my little ang-- ohh!

1024
01:11:53,843 --> 01:11:56,778
- What are you doing here?
- Helping.

1025
01:11:56,846 --> 01:11:59,781
I thought you said
you had a stomach ache.

1026
01:11:59,849 --> 01:12:02,215
I'm in love with you!

1027
01:12:02,285 --> 01:12:03,775
- You?
- Hello.

1028
01:12:03,853 --> 01:12:06,083
- Move!
- Too crowded.

1029
01:12:06,156 --> 01:12:08,021
Hey, what do I look like,
a chair?

1030
01:12:08,091 --> 01:12:09,490
Hi. Is there anything I can do?

1031
01:12:09,559 --> 01:12:11,288
- Huh?
- Hey!

1032
01:12:19,369 --> 01:12:21,200
What's come over you, my dear?

1033
01:12:21,271 --> 01:12:24,297
It's not like you to challenge
a ship like Goliath.

1034
01:12:24,374 --> 01:12:26,308
You know,
the odds are against you.

1035
01:12:26,376 --> 01:12:29,106
I'm after treasure. That's all.

1036
01:12:29,179 --> 01:12:32,910
Heh heh heh. I must admit,
those kids are cute.

1037
01:12:32,983 --> 01:12:35,508
What do you mean by that,
you old fool?

1038
01:12:35,585 --> 01:12:37,280
Nothing.
But that little girl...

1039
01:12:37,354 --> 01:12:39,845
does remind me of you
not so long ago.

1040
01:12:39,923 --> 01:12:41,686
- Who asked ya?
- Nobody.

1041
01:12:41,758 --> 01:12:44,318
- Oh, look. Checkmate.
- Huh?

1042
01:12:44,394 --> 01:12:45,861
Fabulous!

1043
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:52,664
Does anyone want any more?

1044
01:12:52,736 --> 01:12:55,068
I do believe I will have
a second helping.

1045
01:12:55,138 --> 01:12:56,400
- Yes!
- I want some more!

1046
01:13:13,946 --> 01:13:15,538
Up and at 'em, youngster.

1047
01:13:15,614 --> 01:13:17,377
Come on, young pup.

1048
01:13:17,449 --> 01:13:18,746
Huh?

1049
01:13:20,019 --> 01:13:22,112
Time to go on duty.

1050
01:13:22,187 --> 01:13:23,745
It's cold. Take this.

1051
01:13:25,824 --> 01:13:27,052
Huh?

1052
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:36,559
Keep your eyes peeled.
Don't fall asleep.

1053
01:13:36,635 --> 01:13:37,693
Aye-aye, sir.

1054
01:13:37,770 --> 01:13:41,262
It's cold.

1055
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:44,036
- I'll take over.
- Thank you!

1056
01:13:52,785 --> 01:13:53,911
Huh?

1057
01:13:56,488 --> 01:13:58,786
Sheeta!

1058
01:13:58,857 --> 01:14:02,054
Ohh. Whoa!

1059
01:14:02,127 --> 01:14:04,823
Ohh! That was exciting.

1060
01:14:04,897 --> 01:14:07,422
Wow! You can see forever.

1061
01:14:17,343 --> 01:14:18,708
Ohh.

1062
01:14:18,777 --> 01:14:21,302
Sheeta? Here.

1063
01:14:24,650 --> 01:14:25,912
You OK?

1064
01:14:25,985 --> 01:14:27,577
That's better.

1065
01:14:28,887 --> 01:14:30,616
We have to be really quiet.

1066
01:14:30,689 --> 01:14:32,589
We don't want Dola
to know you're up here.

1067
01:14:32,658 --> 01:14:35,627
This is great.
Now we can keep watch together.

1068
01:14:35,694 --> 01:14:37,594
- Pazu?
- Hmm?

1069
01:14:37,663 --> 01:14:39,631
I'm really scared.

1070
01:14:39,698 --> 01:14:42,826
To tell you the truth,
I don't want to go to Laputa.

1071
01:14:42,901 --> 01:14:44,459
You don't want
to go to Laputa?

1072
01:14:44,536 --> 01:14:46,163
What do you mean?
I don't get it.

1073
01:14:46,238 --> 01:14:47,603
Didn't you tell Dola
the truth?

1074
01:14:47,673 --> 01:14:48,833
Huh?

1075
01:14:48,907 --> 01:14:50,568
I didn't lie to Dola.

1076
01:14:50,642 --> 01:14:53,304
What I said about
the light's direction is true.

1077
01:14:53,379 --> 01:14:55,973
But what if someone else dies?

1078
01:14:56,048 --> 01:14:57,413
You mean, like the robot?

1079
01:14:57,483 --> 01:14:59,417
He died to save my life.

1080
01:14:59,485 --> 01:15:01,419
I feel awful.

1081
01:15:01,487 --> 01:15:05,150
All this is because of a spell
my grandmother taught me.

1082
01:15:05,224 --> 01:15:07,818
She taught me
all sorts of spells.

1083
01:15:07,893 --> 01:15:10,623
A spell to use when you're
looking for something...

1084
01:15:10,696 --> 01:15:12,425
a spell to cure sickness.

1085
01:15:12,498 --> 01:15:15,831
There's even one she told me
I must never use.

1086
01:15:15,901 --> 01:15:18,836
- What kind of spell?
- The spell of destruction.

1087
01:15:18,904 --> 01:15:21,202
She said that
to give power to good spells...

1088
01:15:21,273 --> 01:15:23,298
I had to know evil ones, too.

1089
01:15:23,375 --> 01:15:25,639
But she told me
never to use it.

1090
01:15:25,711 --> 01:15:28,305
I was so scared
when I leaned that spell...

1091
01:15:28,380 --> 01:15:29,574
I couldn't sleep.

1092
01:15:29,648 --> 01:15:32,640
I didn't know the spells
were connected to my necklace.

1093
01:15:32,718 --> 01:15:34,652
Uncle Pom was right
when he said...

1094
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:38,156
that it was dangerous for us to
misuse the power of the crystal.

1095
01:15:38,223 --> 01:15:40,714
And what if Laputa
has the same power...

1096
01:15:40,793 --> 01:15:43,557
that can also be used
for great evil?

1097
01:15:43,629 --> 01:15:46,189
I wish
I'd thrown the crystal away.

1098
01:15:46,265 --> 01:15:48,028
But then we never
would have met.

1099
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:51,331
And anyway, even if you had,
Laputa would still exist.

1100
01:15:51,403 --> 01:15:54,566
Airplanes and flying machines
are getting better and better.

1101
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:57,040
You know, eventually,
some explorer or another...

1102
01:15:57,109 --> 01:16:00,545
will come across the city
of Laputa one day and claim it.

1103
01:16:00,612 --> 01:16:02,546
I can't say
I know what's best...

1104
01:16:02,614 --> 01:16:04,548
but if Laputa really has
such great power...

1105
01:16:04,616 --> 01:16:05,947
we can't let it
fall into the hands...

1106
01:16:06,018 --> 01:16:08,646
of bad people like Muska.

1107
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:13,885
And if we run away now,
Muska is gonna chase us forever.

1108
01:16:13,959 --> 01:16:16,120
But Pazu, I don't want you
to become a pirate...

1109
01:16:16,195 --> 01:16:17,526
because of me.

1110
01:16:17,596 --> 01:16:19,564
I'm not gonna become a pirate.

1111
01:16:19,631 --> 01:16:21,656
And don't worry.
Dola will understand.

1112
01:16:21,733 --> 01:16:24,065
She's much nicer
than she pretends to be.

1113
01:16:24,136 --> 01:16:25,967
And when
we've finally found it...

1114
01:16:26,038 --> 01:16:28,063
I promise you
we'll go back to Gondoa.

1115
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:29,801
I want to see it all, Sheeta.

1116
01:16:29,875 --> 01:16:33,072
The old house where you were
bon, the valley and everything.

1117
01:16:33,145 --> 01:16:35,579
Oh, Pazu. Thank you.

1118
01:16:35,647 --> 01:16:38,582
- Sheeta, what's that?
- Huh? What?

1119
01:16:38,650 --> 01:16:40,880
Right there. Under the ship.
See it?

1120
01:16:40,953 --> 01:16:42,921
What is it?

1121
01:16:44,923 --> 01:16:48,450
- Oh, no!
- "Oh, no" is right.

1122
01:16:48,527 --> 01:16:50,688
Captain, it's Goliath--
right under our bow!

1123
01:16:55,767 --> 01:16:57,701
Starboard rudder,
full speed ahead!

1124
01:17:27,799 --> 01:17:30,927
Why don't you go after them,
Muska? Get them!

1125
01:17:31,003 --> 01:17:33,665
It's useless to look for them
in the cloud cover.

1126
01:17:33,739 --> 01:17:37,231
I don't need to waste my energy
on a wild-goose chase.

1127
01:17:37,309 --> 01:17:40,244
Besides, we're running
right on schedule.

1128
01:17:52,324 --> 01:17:54,656
It was farther north
than I figured.

1129
01:17:54,726 --> 01:17:57,160
Pazu, listen carefully to me.

1130
01:17:57,229 --> 01:18:00,255
Everything will be ruined
if we lose track of Goliath.

1131
01:18:00,332 --> 01:18:01,799
You've got good eyes.
So I want you...

1132
01:18:01,867 --> 01:18:03,334
to watch her
and keep us on course.

1133
01:18:03,402 --> 01:18:04,494
How do I do that, captain?

1134
01:18:04,570 --> 01:18:06,435
The crow's nest
can be made into a kite.

1135
01:18:06,505 --> 01:18:07,995
See the metal handle
on the bulkhead?

1136
01:18:08,073 --> 01:18:10,564
- I got it!
- Turn it clockwise!

1137
01:18:13,579 --> 01:18:15,410
Hook it up
and then turn the handle.

1138
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:18,005
That'll make the wings open.

1139
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:22,987
Now extend the wire.

1140
01:18:23,055 --> 01:18:25,114
You'll have to get the hang
of flying it on your own.

1141
01:18:25,190 --> 01:18:26,282
There!

1142
01:18:26,358 --> 01:18:28,292
Are you up there,
Sheeta, my dear?

1143
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:30,624
- Yes.
- Best you come down right now.

1144
01:18:30,696 --> 01:18:32,061
Why?

1145
01:18:32,130 --> 01:18:34,655
Because you're a girl--
a female! That's man's work!

1146
01:18:34,733 --> 01:18:36,530
But you're female, captain!

1147
01:18:36,602 --> 01:18:38,763
I grew up in the mountains.
I can do this!

1148
01:18:38,837 --> 01:18:39,929
Sheeta, no!

1149
01:18:40,005 --> 01:18:43,497
Be quiet.
And Pazu agrees with me.

1150
01:18:43,575 --> 01:18:45,600
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1151
01:18:45,677 --> 01:18:47,645
All right, me hearty,
once you take off...

1152
01:18:47,713 --> 01:18:49,442
you'll have to use the phone
to communicate.

1153
01:18:51,550 --> 01:18:53,313
You mean this phone?

1154
01:18:53,385 --> 01:18:54,579
She is good.

1155
01:18:54,653 --> 01:18:57,588
Right. I think we're set.
Ready for takeoff.

1156
01:18:57,656 --> 01:18:59,214
Aye-aye. Anchors away!

1157
01:19:18,176 --> 01:19:20,371
I don't see them.

1158
01:19:20,445 --> 01:19:22,106
They must be hiding
under the cloud cover.

1159
01:19:22,180 --> 01:19:24,546
Perhaps. But they
could also be above you.

1160
01:19:24,616 --> 01:19:25,878
Keep your eyes peeled..

1161
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:28,886
- Roger! Whoa!
- Whoa!

1162
01:19:28,954 --> 01:19:30,080
Hang on tight!

1163
01:19:36,762 --> 01:19:38,730
What happened?

1164
01:19:38,797 --> 01:19:40,697
Nothing. Just a gust of wind.

1165
01:19:40,766 --> 01:19:43,894
Didn't bother us at all.

1166
01:19:43,969 --> 01:19:46,563
We're fine.
We'll keep on watching.

1167
01:19:46,638 --> 01:19:49,038
- Afraid?
- Uh-uh.

1168
01:19:49,107 --> 01:19:51,166
I got the hang
of this thing now.

1169
01:19:51,243 --> 01:19:52,710
Storm ahead.

1170
01:19:55,514 --> 01:19:56,913
Sheeta, look in my bag.

1171
01:19:56,982 --> 01:19:58,472
There should be some rope
in there.

1172
01:19:58,550 --> 01:19:59,847
OK.

1173
01:19:59,918 --> 01:20:02,250
Let's tie ourselves together.
This storm is gonna be rough.

1174
01:20:02,321 --> 01:20:03,447
Good idea.

1175
01:20:06,525 --> 01:20:08,993
The mercury is dropping
really fast, mom.

1176
01:20:09,061 --> 01:20:11,894
Blast our luck, boys.
What a rotten time for a storm.

1177
01:20:11,963 --> 01:20:14,454
- When is sun-up?
- In one hour.

1178
01:20:30,682 --> 01:20:32,240
Wait a minute.
Something's not right.

1179
01:20:32,317 --> 01:20:34,581
The sun is coming up
in the wrong place.

1180
01:20:34,653 --> 01:20:35,950
We're out of position.

1181
01:20:36,021 --> 01:20:38,012
You're right. We're supposed
to be heading east, not north.

1182
01:20:38,090 --> 01:20:40,115
We're going the wrong way.
Captain!

1183
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:42,456
Huh? What do you mean,
we're headed north?

1184
01:20:42,527 --> 01:20:44,688
But the compass needle
is pointing east, mom.

1185
01:20:44,763 --> 01:20:46,492
There's something
confusing the compass...

1186
01:20:46,565 --> 01:20:48,157
and I want to know what it is!

1187
01:20:48,233 --> 01:20:49,461
There it is! Look!

1188
01:20:49,534 --> 01:20:51,365
There what is? Is it Goliath?

1189
01:20:51,436 --> 01:20:52,630
No, it's a cloud...

1190
01:20:52,704 --> 01:20:54,695
and I've only seen
one other like it.

1191
01:20:54,773 --> 01:20:56,138
A cloud?

1192
01:20:56,208 --> 01:20:58,267
It's heading right for us!

1193
01:21:12,257 --> 01:21:13,519
That's it.

1194
01:21:13,592 --> 01:21:15,924
I'm not gonna captain my ship
into the eye of a hurricane!

1195
01:21:15,994 --> 01:21:19,361
Pull back! Pull back,
I tell you! All engines reverse!

1196
01:21:37,482 --> 01:21:39,416
We're being pulled
into the center of the storm!

1197
01:21:39,484 --> 01:21:41,418
Sorry, Pazu,
we can't help you!

1198
01:21:41,486 --> 01:21:43,386
You have to ride it out.
Good luck, sailor!

1199
01:21:48,627 --> 01:21:50,652
I can't get it to turn!

1200
01:21:50,729 --> 01:21:52,754
Put more backbone into it,
my boy!

1201
01:21:52,831 --> 01:21:55,561
Dola, the engine can't take it!

1202
01:21:55,634 --> 01:21:57,499
What do you want me
to do about it?

1203
01:21:57,569 --> 01:21:59,002
Just do what you can!

1204
01:22:00,472 --> 01:22:01,837
Clouds are breaking up.

1205
01:22:08,447 --> 01:22:10,847
- Uhh! It's the ocean!
- Huh?

1206
01:22:22,828 --> 01:22:24,352
Pazu, it's a hurricane!

1207
01:22:24,429 --> 01:22:26,897
I see it, captain!
We're going in!

1208
01:22:35,941 --> 01:22:38,842
Wow.
It's just like dad said--

1209
01:22:38,910 --> 01:22:40,878
two winds blowing
in opposite directions.

1210
01:22:44,950 --> 01:22:47,441
Shiver me timbers!
What a powerful storm!

1211
01:22:47,519 --> 01:22:49,714
Mom, it's no use!
We'll be sucked in!

1212
01:22:49,788 --> 01:22:52,848
If there's one thing
I can't stand, it's a quitter!

1213
01:22:52,924 --> 01:22:54,983
Captain, Laputa's in there!

1214
01:22:55,060 --> 01:22:56,391
Laputa's where?

1215
01:22:56,461 --> 01:22:58,395
This is just the kind of storm
my father saw...

1216
01:22:58,463 --> 01:22:59,896
and Laputa's
in the middle of it!

1217
01:22:59,965 --> 01:23:03,833
It can't be.
It'd be smashed to pieces!

1218
01:23:03,902 --> 01:23:06,132
- Pazu! Look there!
- Huh?

1219
01:23:08,707 --> 01:23:10,766
My boys, we have a dilemma.

1220
01:23:10,842 --> 01:23:13,777
It's Goliath off the port bow!

1221
01:23:22,354 --> 01:23:24,447
We're gonna go
into the hurricane, Sheeta!

1222
01:23:24,523 --> 01:23:26,787
My dad made it through alive,
and so will we!

1223
01:23:26,858 --> 01:23:29,019
Ready?
Brace yourselves, gentlemen!

1224
01:23:29,094 --> 01:23:30,288
Aah!

1225
01:23:34,165 --> 01:23:36,133
Aah!

1226
01:23:41,740 --> 01:23:44,265
We did it! Got 'em!

1227
01:23:44,342 --> 01:23:46,674
If we don't turn,
we'll hit that storm.

1228
01:23:46,745 --> 01:23:48,770
- All ahead full.
- Sir?

1229
01:23:48,847 --> 01:23:52,783
The light is pointing
to the center of the whirlwind.

1230
01:23:52,851 --> 01:23:56,617
Laputa is in that storm.
I won't retreat.

1231
01:23:56,688 --> 01:24:00,021
Now go straight ahead--
and that is an order, captain.

1232
01:24:12,203 --> 01:24:14,398
- Ready, Sheeta?
- Yes!

1233
01:24:45,103 --> 01:24:46,297
Huh?

1234
01:24:54,245 --> 01:24:55,712
Father?

1235
01:27:07,879 --> 01:27:09,073
Huh?

1236
01:27:12,717 --> 01:27:14,651
Sheeta!
Hey, are you all right?

1237
01:27:14,719 --> 01:27:16,152
Wake up.

1238
01:27:17,555 --> 01:27:18,817
Uhh.

1239
01:27:18,890 --> 01:27:20,016
Mm.

1240
01:27:21,993 --> 01:27:23,722
Look.

1241
01:27:37,408 --> 01:27:39,467
Laputa.

1242
01:27:39,544 --> 01:27:41,944
- Uhh!
- I'm sorry.

1243
01:27:42,013 --> 01:27:44,072
- Here.
- Wait a minute.

1244
01:27:44,149 --> 01:27:46,083
It's a very tight knot.

1245
01:27:46,151 --> 01:27:48,585
And... my... uhh!

1246
01:27:48,653 --> 01:27:51,144
My hands are trembling.

1247
01:27:51,222 --> 01:27:52,314
Whoa!

1248
01:27:52,390 --> 01:27:54,722
Whoo-hoo!

1249
01:27:56,528 --> 01:27:58,519
Wow.

1250
01:27:58,596 --> 01:28:01,827
We're here. We really found it.

1251
01:28:12,977 --> 01:28:16,469
- Hoo-hoo!
- Ohh!

1252
01:28:16,548 --> 01:28:18,914
- Aah!
- Whoa!

1253
01:28:30,895 --> 01:28:33,090
Pretty birds.

1254
01:28:33,164 --> 01:28:35,291
They must live here, Pazu.

1255
01:28:37,669 --> 01:28:38,636
Huh?

1256
01:28:46,010 --> 01:28:48,001
I think he must be here
to meet you, Sheeta.

1257
01:28:48,079 --> 01:28:50,047
But I don't have
the aetherium crystal.

1258
01:28:50,114 --> 01:28:51,945
Wait, I've gotta cut us loose.

1259
01:29:09,567 --> 01:29:11,057
Hey, wait!

1260
01:29:11,135 --> 01:29:13,968
- You're gonna break that!
- Wait!

1261
01:29:14,038 --> 01:29:16,029
Please, Mr.Robot,
don't do that.

1262
01:29:16,107 --> 01:29:18,075
We won't be able to go home
without it.

1263
01:29:33,925 --> 01:29:35,950
It's a bird's nest.

1264
01:29:36,027 --> 01:29:38,587
That's why he's here.

1265
01:29:40,331 --> 01:29:42,094
He's just trying to protect it.

1266
01:29:42,166 --> 01:29:46,102
I'm so happy
the eggs are all right, Pazu.

1267
01:29:46,170 --> 01:29:47,967
It must be his job
to take care of them.

1268
01:29:55,313 --> 01:29:57,713
- He says to follow him.
- How do you know?

1269
01:29:57,782 --> 01:29:59,044
I just know that's what he said!

1270
01:30:10,295 --> 01:30:12,786
Hey, Sheeta, did you see those?

1271
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:14,229
- Ohh!
- Look!

1272
01:30:22,807 --> 01:30:24,798
It's a city.

1273
01:30:38,122 --> 01:30:39,419
Ohh.

1274
01:30:44,329 --> 01:30:47,059
It's a giant garden.

1275
01:30:47,131 --> 01:30:49,691
I've never seen anything
like it. It's beautiful.

1276
01:30:52,136 --> 01:30:54,434
I can't believe
we're inside a building.

1277
01:30:54,505 --> 01:30:56,097
I know. Huh?

1278
01:30:56,174 --> 01:30:58,608
But it doesn't look like
a building from the inside.

1279
01:30:58,676 --> 01:31:01,611
- Wow, the walls are invisible.
- Yeah.

1280
01:31:10,221 --> 01:31:12,280
I wonder what happened here.

1281
01:31:12,357 --> 01:31:14,985
This used to be a city
of advanced technology.

1282
01:31:17,395 --> 01:31:20,364
The further we walk,
the bigger the trees get.

1283
01:31:24,369 --> 01:31:25,893
- Wow.
- Ohh.

1284
01:31:25,970 --> 01:31:28,131
Look at the size of that one.

1285
01:31:28,206 --> 01:31:30,674
It must be
a thousand years old.

1286
01:32:05,843 --> 01:32:09,939
The robot was
leading us to this place, Pazu.

1287
01:32:10,014 --> 01:32:11,641
Wow.

1288
01:32:13,885 --> 01:32:15,512
It must be a monument.

1289
01:32:15,586 --> 01:32:17,451
I wish I could read
what it says.

1290
01:32:19,957 --> 01:32:22,653
Someone left some flowers.
Look.

1291
01:32:25,229 --> 01:32:28,096
Did you leave the flowers?

1292
01:32:29,367 --> 01:32:31,164
Hey, that's a different robot.

1293
01:32:35,740 --> 01:32:38,834
It looks like it's been
frozen there forever.

1294
01:32:38,910 --> 01:32:40,207
Hey.

1295
01:32:40,278 --> 01:32:42,906
Look. There are more of them.

1296
01:32:50,455 --> 01:32:53,515
They must've been
protectors of the garden.

1297
01:32:54,892 --> 01:32:56,416
And they've kept on
guarding the place...

1298
01:32:56,494 --> 01:32:59,156
even long after
all the people have gone.

1299
01:33:11,576 --> 01:33:14,409
Oh! You've picked
another flower for the grave.

1300
01:33:14,479 --> 01:33:16,777
How kind of you.

1301
01:33:18,749 --> 01:33:20,512
Oh, thank you.

1302
01:33:22,587 --> 01:33:24,350
You must be the only one left.

1303
01:33:24,422 --> 01:33:25,912
It looks like
all the other robots...

1304
01:33:25,990 --> 01:33:27,423
stopped working a long time ago.

1305
01:33:35,233 --> 01:33:37,497
Ha!

1306
01:33:52,750 --> 01:33:55,310
You know what, Sheeta?
I bet he's not lonesome at all.

1307
01:33:55,386 --> 01:33:58,844
He's got plenty of friends--
the animals and the birds.

1308
01:33:58,923 --> 01:34:00,948
He takes care of them.

1309
01:34:16,607 --> 01:34:17,938
This way!

1310
01:34:28,953 --> 01:34:31,387
The army has destroyed
this part of the city!

1311
01:34:31,455 --> 01:34:34,322
All right, men.
Let's move it!

1312
01:34:34,392 --> 01:34:37,293
- Let's move!
- Yes, sir!

1313
01:34:37,361 --> 01:34:39,386
Come on, double time!

1314
01:34:39,463 --> 01:34:40,930
Isn't that the Tiger Moth?

1315
01:34:40,998 --> 01:34:42,932
That's Dola's ship.
All right. It's been hit.

1316
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:44,433
Wow. Goliath's bigger
than I thought.

1317
01:34:44,502 --> 01:34:45,992
Just look at
all those soldiers.

1318
01:34:46,070 --> 01:34:48,129
We have to do something, Pazu.

1319
01:34:48,206 --> 01:34:50,003
I know, but what?

1320
01:34:50,074 --> 01:34:53,237
I sure hope Dola
and the boys are all right.

1321
01:34:53,311 --> 01:34:56,474
Me, too. Where are they?
Do you see them?

1322
01:34:56,547 --> 01:34:59,311
Wait! There they are!
They've got 'em prisoner!

1323
01:34:59,383 --> 01:35:01,317
They've been captured!
We've got to help them!

1324
01:35:01,385 --> 01:35:03,353
If we don't, they'll hang 'em
from the yardarm!

1325
01:35:03,421 --> 01:35:06,549
- What'll we do?
- Come on.

1326
01:35:06,624 --> 01:35:08,353
Hurry!

1327
01:35:08,426 --> 01:35:10,360
Sir! Sir!

1328
01:35:10,428 --> 01:35:13,625
We've managed
to break down the wall, general.

1329
01:35:13,698 --> 01:35:16,360
Just a sample
of what we found inside.

1330
01:35:16,434 --> 01:35:19,369
The city
is full of treasure, sir.

1331
01:35:19,437 --> 01:35:21,064
- Mama!
- Whoa.

1332
01:35:21,138 --> 01:35:23,663
Wouldn't you like to have this?

1333
01:35:23,741 --> 01:35:26,767
Well, I've got a different
kind of necklace for you!

1334
01:35:26,844 --> 01:35:29,540
Have you radioed a report
on Laputa's discovery, Muska?

1335
01:35:29,614 --> 01:35:30,876
I was about to.

1336
01:35:30,948 --> 01:35:33,644
See if you can make it
difficult to decode.

1337
01:35:33,718 --> 01:35:36,687
And stop pocketing
those jewels, you scum!

1338
01:35:38,222 --> 01:35:41,749
The perfect thing to
throw those fools off the scent.

1339
01:35:58,276 --> 01:36:00,107
We're up so high.

1340
01:36:00,177 --> 01:36:02,202
I hope you're good
at climbing trees, Sheeta.

1341
01:36:04,181 --> 01:36:05,648
I've got a plan.

1342
01:36:07,618 --> 01:36:08,778
Ohh!

1343
01:36:38,616 --> 01:36:41,346
What a greedy pack of thieves.

1344
01:36:41,419 --> 01:36:44,388
We can't let them
destroy the garden, Pazu.

1345
01:36:44,455 --> 01:36:46,753
We have to find
the aetherium crystal.

1346
01:36:48,326 --> 01:36:49,452
We have to find it.

1347
01:36:49,527 --> 01:36:51,518
It's the only way
we can protect the garden.

1348
01:36:51,595 --> 01:36:52,721
I was wondering why...

1349
01:36:52,797 --> 01:36:54,264
all of the storm clouds
just disappeared.

1350
01:36:54,332 --> 01:36:56,300
Then I realized
if they hadn't cleared up...

1351
01:36:56,367 --> 01:36:58,267
the army
couldn't have made a landing.

1352
01:36:58,336 --> 01:37:00,804
You think it was
because of my necklace?

1353
01:37:00,871 --> 01:37:02,338
I don't know for sure,
but I think...

1354
01:37:02,406 --> 01:37:04,772
the power of the crystal
disintegrated that storm...

1355
01:37:04,842 --> 01:37:07,208
and now the castle
has awakened from its sleep...

1356
01:37:07,278 --> 01:37:09,405
for whoever holds the crystal.

1357
01:37:11,349 --> 01:37:14,284
We can't let Muska figure out
how to use the crystal.

1358
01:37:14,352 --> 01:37:17,219
If he does.
It'll be the end of everything.

1359
01:37:17,288 --> 01:37:19,688
But even if we can get
my grandmother's crystal back...

1360
01:37:19,757 --> 01:37:21,554
how can we use its power?

1361
01:37:21,625 --> 01:37:23,820
The spell, Pazu!

1362
01:37:23,894 --> 01:37:25,919
The spell of destruction.

1363
01:37:25,996 --> 01:37:27,463
Sheeta, it may be the only way.

1364
01:37:27,531 --> 01:37:28,759
- What is it?
- Huh?

1365
01:37:28,833 --> 01:37:30,596
Over here.
I thought I heard something.

1366
01:37:33,938 --> 01:37:35,633
Do you see anything?

1367
01:37:35,706 --> 01:37:38,106
No. All clear.

1368
01:37:38,175 --> 01:37:39,870
We need help over here!

1369
01:37:39,944 --> 01:37:42,970
You, soldier!
Go find the general!

1370
01:37:43,047 --> 01:37:44,639
Somebody give us a hand!

1371
01:37:44,715 --> 01:37:46,114
Move now! You heard me!

1372
01:37:50,755 --> 01:37:52,120
Quickly!

1373
01:37:55,192 --> 01:37:57,160
We need to get down there.

1374
01:38:14,245 --> 01:38:15,837
I'll go first.

1375
01:38:15,913 --> 01:38:17,778
Right. Be careful.

1376
01:38:19,784 --> 01:38:23,550
Unh! Aah!

1377
01:38:23,621 --> 01:38:25,555
It's OK-- aah!

1378
01:38:28,392 --> 01:38:29,552
Unh!

1379
01:38:34,031 --> 01:38:35,123
Aah!

1380
01:38:35,199 --> 01:38:37,827
It's around here somewhere.

1381
01:38:39,270 --> 01:38:42,137
We're looking
for a doorway, colonel?

1382
01:38:42,206 --> 01:38:44,140
I don't see anything, sir.

1383
01:38:44,208 --> 01:38:45,971
Aah!

1384
01:38:46,043 --> 01:38:47,135
Hmm.

1385
01:38:51,081 --> 01:38:53,709
It should be here. Wait!

1386
01:38:54,885 --> 01:38:56,216
This is it!

1387
01:39:00,825 --> 01:39:02,224
- Look!
- Incredible!

1388
01:39:04,562 --> 01:39:06,826
- Huh?
- Unh!

1389
01:39:06,897 --> 01:39:08,228
It's the boy!

1390
01:39:08,299 --> 01:39:10,494
- Aah!
- Aah!

1391
01:39:10,568 --> 01:39:11,865
Look out!

1392
01:39:11,936 --> 01:39:14,564
- Sheeta!
- Stop! Don't shoot!

1393
01:39:14,638 --> 01:39:16,105
Not so fast.

1394
01:39:16,173 --> 01:39:19,404
Well, well, looks like
we caught a little princess.

1395
01:39:19,477 --> 01:39:21,843
Don't hurt her!

1396
01:39:21,912 --> 01:39:24,403
- Unh!
- It came from over here!

1397
01:39:24,482 --> 01:39:27,940
- Colonel, what's happening?
- We've found another pirate.

1398
01:39:28,018 --> 01:39:30,282
And there's one more
hiding under your feet.

1399
01:39:30,354 --> 01:39:32,549
Yes, sir! We'll get him.

1400
01:39:35,259 --> 01:39:37,193
Sheeta, I'll find you!

1401
01:39:37,261 --> 01:39:39,889
Pazu!

1402
01:39:39,964 --> 01:39:41,397
Huh?

1403
01:39:42,533 --> 01:39:43,727
Give me a hand grenade!

1404
01:39:43,801 --> 01:39:45,735
Is that Pazu?

1405
01:39:45,803 --> 01:39:46,929
Uhh!

1406
01:39:48,439 --> 01:39:51,806
- Holy smokes!
- Eww.

1407
01:39:51,876 --> 01:39:53,776
That wasn't me!

1408
01:39:53,844 --> 01:39:55,402
Hmm. That's hot.

1409
01:39:55,479 --> 01:39:58,209
- Mom, what's going on?
- Hmm.

1410
01:39:58,282 --> 01:40:01,718
- I need the commanding officer!
- That way!

1411
01:40:01,785 --> 01:40:03,582
The general's waiting
over there.

1412
01:40:03,654 --> 01:40:05,212
Guards, on the double! Now!

1413
01:40:05,289 --> 01:40:06,756
You men, come with me!

1414
01:40:06,824 --> 01:40:07,916
- Right away, sir!
- Yes, sir!

1415
01:40:07,992 --> 01:40:10,017
- Dola.
- Huh?

1416
01:40:10,094 --> 01:40:11,220
Hmm?

1417
01:40:13,297 --> 01:40:14,594
Hi there.

1418
01:40:14,665 --> 01:40:17,395
Sheeta's been captured.
I'm going to save her.

1419
01:40:17,468 --> 01:40:20,232
When I cut your ropes.
Make a run for it.

1420
01:40:24,842 --> 01:40:28,141
Ohh, thanks. That's got it.

1421
01:40:28,212 --> 01:40:30,476
Good luck, now, captain.

1422
01:40:30,548 --> 01:40:32,243
Wait a minute, boy.

1423
01:40:32,316 --> 01:40:34,648
You'd better take this.

1424
01:40:35,686 --> 01:40:38,519
Huh? Uhh-- thank you.

1425
01:40:41,058 --> 01:40:43,993
The boy has become a man.

1426
01:40:44,061 --> 01:40:48,225
What? What do you mean, Muska's
destroyed all the radios?

1427
01:40:48,299 --> 01:40:51,860
Sir! He must've done it while
most of the men were outside.

1428
01:40:51,936 --> 01:40:54,427
Several of the guards
have been seriously injured.

1429
01:40:54,505 --> 01:40:57,133
We've spotted Muska heading
for the black dome below, sir.

1430
01:40:57,207 --> 01:40:59,732
He's not alone. He's got
those other two men with him.

1431
01:40:59,810 --> 01:41:02,904
So, Colonel Muska reveals
his true nature at last.

1432
01:41:02,980 --> 01:41:05,141
Now find him and arrest him!

1433
01:41:05,215 --> 01:41:06,910
All right, first platoon, move!

1434
01:41:06,984 --> 01:41:08,144
Second platoon, fall in!

1435
01:41:08,218 --> 01:41:10,982
You are to shoot
anyone who resists!

1436
01:41:11,055 --> 01:41:13,523
We must find Colonel Muska now!

1437
01:41:32,610 --> 01:41:36,910
Uh, excuse me, Colonel Muska.
Where are we?

1438
01:41:36,981 --> 01:41:38,881
We are in the center of Laputa.

1439
01:41:38,949 --> 01:41:40,883
The castle above us
means nothing!

1440
01:41:40,951 --> 01:41:43,249
All of Laputa's
scientific knowledge...

1441
01:41:43,320 --> 01:41:45,880
is contained in this chamber.

1442
01:41:48,025 --> 01:41:49,322
Ladies first.

1443
01:41:50,761 --> 01:41:52,786
You may wait here, gentlemen.

1444
01:41:52,863 --> 01:41:54,387
- Colonel!
- Colonel, please!

1445
01:41:54,465 --> 01:41:56,092
This is a sacred place...

1446
01:41:56,166 --> 01:41:58,396
where only royalty
is allowed to enter.

1447
01:42:00,437 --> 01:42:03,406
Huh? What's happened here? Uhh!

1448
01:42:03,474 --> 01:42:06,637
These filthy roots
don't belong in this chamber!

1449
01:42:10,080 --> 01:42:13,379
Horrible things.
I'll have them burned.

1450
01:42:13,450 --> 01:42:14,917
This way. Come!

1451
01:42:27,865 --> 01:42:30,595
There it is! This is it.

1452
01:42:30,668 --> 01:42:32,397
See?

1453
01:42:38,175 --> 01:42:41,542
Not here, too! Aah!

1454
01:42:43,714 --> 01:42:45,147
Roots?

1455
01:42:48,118 --> 01:42:51,144
Nothing but tree stumps
and vines!

1456
01:42:51,221 --> 01:42:53,416
Stupid, ugly, dirty,
disgusting things!

1457
01:42:55,659 --> 01:42:58,287
At last!
At last I have found it!

1458
01:43:00,164 --> 01:43:02,826
The largest
aetherium crystal ever.

1459
01:43:02,900 --> 01:43:06,495
And the source
of all the power in Laputa.

1460
01:43:06,570 --> 01:43:08,868
The amazing thing
is this beautiful stone...

1461
01:43:08,939 --> 01:43:11,840
has been awaiting the return
of its king for 700 years.

1462
01:43:11,909 --> 01:43:13,308
Seven hundred years?

1463
01:43:13,377 --> 01:43:18,110
700 years is a long time
to be without a king, isn't it?

1464
01:43:21,185 --> 01:43:24,313
It's the black stone,
just as the legend says.

1465
01:43:30,194 --> 01:43:32,128
Get away!

1466
01:43:33,964 --> 01:43:36,125
There it is. It's the same.

1467
01:43:37,301 --> 01:43:39,132
Who are you, Muska?

1468
01:43:40,437 --> 01:43:45,397
Yes, my dear.
I, too, have an old secret name.

1469
01:43:45,476 --> 01:43:48,639
My real name is
Romska Polo Ul Laputa.

1470
01:43:51,215 --> 01:43:54,343
You and I
have the same royal ancestors.

1471
01:43:54,418 --> 01:43:56,147
We are both of noble blood.

1472
01:43:56,220 --> 01:43:58,484
But then our ancestors
left Laputa to live on earth.

1473
01:43:58,555 --> 01:43:59,647
What a mistake!

1474
01:44:09,233 --> 01:44:12,794
- The explosives have no effect!
- This is no ordinary stone!

1475
01:44:12,870 --> 01:44:14,770
Then use all of the dynamite
we have!

1476
01:44:14,838 --> 01:44:16,931
General.
There is no need to do that.

1477
01:44:17,007 --> 01:44:18,736
You may come in.

1478
01:44:18,809 --> 01:44:20,299
Where are you, Muska?

1479
01:44:27,885 --> 01:44:29,819
- Aah!
- Aah!

1480
01:44:29,887 --> 01:44:32,082
Huh?

1481
01:44:35,159 --> 01:44:37,093
Unh!

1482
01:44:39,897 --> 01:44:42,331
Aaaah!

1483
01:44:44,902 --> 01:44:46,733
Unh!

1484
01:44:55,245 --> 01:44:57,736
Huh? Aah!

1485
01:45:13,764 --> 01:45:15,356
Really, I don't understand...

1486
01:45:15,432 --> 01:45:19,198
why you hesitate, general.
Please come in.

1487
01:45:19,269 --> 01:45:21,635
Blast him!
All right, follow me!

1488
01:45:33,050 --> 01:45:34,142
Huh?

1489
01:45:34,218 --> 01:45:36,277
After him, men!

1490
01:45:36,353 --> 01:45:38,844
Wait, wait, hold on!
Wait a second.

1491
01:45:38,922 --> 01:45:40,981
Just where are you, Muska?

1492
01:45:41,058 --> 01:45:43,390
Please be quiet.

1493
01:45:43,460 --> 01:45:44,950
- What?
- Up there!

1494
01:45:46,630 --> 01:45:49,394
- Whoa.
- What's going on?

1495
01:45:51,368 --> 01:45:53,097
Hold your tongue, commoner!

1496
01:45:53,170 --> 01:45:55,798
You are in the presence
of the king of Laputa!

1497
01:45:55,873 --> 01:45:57,807
The man has gone crazy!

1498
01:45:57,875 --> 01:46:00,776
I thought I would show you
an example of Laputa's power.

1499
01:46:00,844 --> 01:46:02,573
We are about to celebrate
the rebirth...

1500
01:46:02,646 --> 01:46:04,079
of the Laputian kingdom.

1501
01:46:04,147 --> 01:46:05,580
Sheeta?

1502
01:46:05,649 --> 01:46:09,585
Prepare yourself
for the thunder of Laputa!

1503
01:46:09,653 --> 01:46:12,588
Sheeta, I'm coming.
Aah!

1504
01:46:32,876 --> 01:46:35,344
The fire of heaven
that destroyed...

1505
01:46:35,412 --> 01:46:37,812
Sodom and Gomorrah
in the Old Testament.

1506
01:46:37,881 --> 01:46:41,817
The Rahmaniya referred to it
as Indra's Arrow.

1507
01:46:41,885 --> 01:46:43,876
The entire world
will once again kneel...

1508
01:46:43,954 --> 01:46:46,047
before the power of Laputa.

1509
01:46:46,123 --> 01:46:50,617
I can only say well-done, Muska.
You're a credit to our country.

1510
01:46:50,694 --> 01:46:53,026
As such,
you deserve this reward.

1511
01:46:56,266 --> 01:46:59,064
Huh?

1512
01:46:59,136 --> 01:47:03,072
I have really had enough
of your incredible stupidity.

1513
01:47:03,140 --> 01:47:05,768
Aah!

1514
01:47:05,842 --> 01:47:07,833
- Run, everyone!
- You little brat!

1515
01:47:07,911 --> 01:47:09,344
Good-bye!

1516
01:47:09,413 --> 01:47:11,108
Enjoy the ride!

1517
01:47:36,473 --> 01:47:37,565
Blimey! More robots!

1518
01:47:37,641 --> 01:47:38,869
Yeah, and there's a lot of them.

1519
01:47:38,942 --> 01:47:41,410
Make a run for it!

1520
01:47:44,982 --> 01:47:47,780
- Check the flapters!
- OK, mom!

1521
01:47:47,851 --> 01:47:50,046
They're ready to travel!

1522
01:47:50,120 --> 01:47:51,246
Time to go, mama!

1523
01:47:51,321 --> 01:47:55,052
Hush up!
They don't know we're here!

1524
01:48:01,531 --> 01:48:04,466
Tanation.
Now, where are Pazu and Sheeta?

1525
01:48:04,534 --> 01:48:05,967
Can't leave without 'em.

1526
01:48:06,036 --> 01:48:07,401
Oh!

1527
01:48:07,471 --> 01:48:10,736
You had better be gracious
to the new king, dear.

1528
01:48:10,807 --> 01:48:12,570
Ohh!

1529
01:48:12,642 --> 01:48:16,237
You and I will be spending
quite a lot of time together.

1530
01:48:18,615 --> 01:48:20,810
Look at the fools.

1531
01:48:20,884 --> 01:48:23,819
Unbelievably stupid!

1532
01:48:23,887 --> 01:48:26,321
Pathetic.

1533
01:48:26,390 --> 01:48:30,326
They simply don't understand.
It is useless to fight me.

1534
01:48:46,910 --> 01:48:50,038
Aah! Uhh!

1535
01:48:50,113 --> 01:48:51,978
Aah! Ah!

1536
01:48:53,450 --> 01:48:54,974
Huh?

1537
01:48:57,888 --> 01:48:59,515
Robots!

1538
01:49:02,092 --> 01:49:04,925
Aah!

1539
01:49:35,926 --> 01:49:37,860
Sheeta!

1540
01:49:41,932 --> 01:49:45,868
A superior being such as
myself has only one option--

1541
01:49:45,936 --> 01:49:47,767
bun them.

1542
01:49:47,838 --> 01:49:51,035
Don't you agree,
Princess Lusheeta?

1543
01:49:51,108 --> 01:49:52,575
- Ahh.
- Stop it, Muska!

1544
01:49:52,642 --> 01:49:54,872
You've got
what you want! Stop it!

1545
01:49:54,945 --> 01:49:56,435
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1546
01:49:56,513 --> 01:50:00,005
- Give me the crystal!
- You insolent little brat!

1547
01:50:00,083 --> 01:50:01,277
Uhh!

1548
01:50:04,921 --> 01:50:06,786
Seize her!

1549
01:50:06,857 --> 01:50:08,154
Ahh.

1550
01:50:11,962 --> 01:50:15,227
Be a good girl
and give the crystal back.

1551
01:50:15,298 --> 01:50:19,564
Please open up! Please!

1552
01:50:19,636 --> 01:50:21,297
Uhh!

1553
01:50:21,371 --> 01:50:22,804
Sheeta!

1554
01:50:24,641 --> 01:50:28,168
Sheeta, listen to me.
Be reasonable.

1555
01:50:28,245 --> 01:50:31,078
There's no way you can escape.

1556
01:50:31,148 --> 01:50:32,775
Please open! Help me!

1557
01:50:32,849 --> 01:50:35,215
They can't hear you.
Only I can help you.

1558
01:50:41,758 --> 01:50:43,089
Ah!

1559
01:50:51,635 --> 01:50:53,796
Sheeta!

1560
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:04,772
Aah!

1561
01:51:07,817 --> 01:51:09,876
Sheeta!

1562
01:51:09,953 --> 01:51:13,252
Pazu? Where are you?

1563
01:51:13,323 --> 01:51:16,019
Sheeta! Over here!

1564
01:51:16,092 --> 01:51:17,616
Sheeta!

1565
01:51:19,496 --> 01:51:21,623
Sheeta!

1566
01:51:21,698 --> 01:51:23,632
- You're alive!
- Stand back.

1567
01:51:23,700 --> 01:51:25,759
I'm gonna blast through.

1568
01:51:25,835 --> 01:51:28,770
- Here we go!
- No, Pazu! Hurry! Take this!

1569
01:51:28,838 --> 01:51:31,068
Muska's coming! Hurry!

1570
01:51:31,141 --> 01:51:33,006
Sheeta!

1571
01:51:35,478 --> 01:51:37,810
Here, take it!

1572
01:51:40,884 --> 01:51:42,818
Throw it into the ocean!

1573
01:51:42,886 --> 01:51:44,012
Uhh!

1574
01:51:45,355 --> 01:51:47,289
Aah!

1575
01:51:47,357 --> 01:51:50,053
Better protect that crystal if
you want to see the girl alive.

1576
01:51:50,126 --> 01:51:52,026
Do you hear me?!

1577
01:52:09,446 --> 01:52:10,538
Sheeta!

1578
01:52:17,854 --> 01:52:19,685
Aah!

1579
01:52:19,756 --> 01:52:23,214
Get up, princess.
The game is over.

1580
01:52:29,566 --> 01:52:32,967
How appropriate that we've
ended up in the throne room.

1581
01:52:33,036 --> 01:52:34,503
Now get over here.

1582
01:52:34,571 --> 01:52:36,436
This is no longer a throne room.

1583
01:52:36,506 --> 01:52:38,997
This is a tomb
for the both of us.

1584
01:52:40,310 --> 01:52:42,278
You see, a king
without compassion...

1585
01:52:42,345 --> 01:52:44,074
does not deserve a kingdom.

1586
01:52:44,147 --> 01:52:46,240
You will never
possess the crystal.

1587
01:52:46,316 --> 01:52:50,047
You and I
will die here together.

1588
01:52:50,120 --> 01:52:53,749
Now I understand why
the people of Laputa vanished.

1589
01:52:53,823 --> 01:52:56,087
There is a song from my home
in the Valley of Gondoa...

1590
01:52:56,159 --> 01:52:57,558
that explains everything.

1591
01:52:57,627 --> 01:53:00,391
It says,
"Take root in the ground...

1592
01:53:00,463 --> 01:53:02,294
"live in harmony
with the wind...

1593
01:53:02,365 --> 01:53:04,196
"plant your seeds
in the winter...

1594
01:53:04,267 --> 01:53:07,065
"and rejoice with the birds
in the coming of spring."

1595
01:53:07,137 --> 01:53:09,264
No matter how many weapons
you have...

1596
01:53:09,339 --> 01:53:12,467
no matter how great
your technology might be...

1597
01:53:12,542 --> 01:53:14,874
the world cannot live
without love.

1598
01:53:19,082 --> 01:53:22,518
Laputa will live.
I will return it to life.

1599
01:53:22,585 --> 01:53:26,180
Laputa's power
is the dream of all mankind.

1600
01:53:27,691 --> 01:53:30,159
Your ears are next...

1601
01:53:30,226 --> 01:53:33,286
unless you get on your knees
and obey me.

1602
01:53:33,363 --> 01:53:35,831
I command you.
Give me that stone!

1603
01:53:35,899 --> 01:53:38,527
Stop right there, Muska!

1604
01:53:38,601 --> 01:53:40,193
I've hidden the stone!

1605
01:53:40,270 --> 01:53:41,669
If you do anything
to harm Sheeta...

1606
01:53:41,738 --> 01:53:43,069
you'll never get it back!

1607
01:53:43,139 --> 01:53:44,800
No, Pazu! Listen!

1608
01:53:44,874 --> 01:53:47,809
Run away before he kills you
as well as me!

1609
01:53:47,877 --> 01:53:49,105
Look who's here.

1610
01:53:49,179 --> 01:53:51,147
Give me the stone,
and the girl will live.

1611
01:53:51,214 --> 01:53:52,374
Otherwise, I'll kill her.

1612
01:53:52,449 --> 01:53:55,282
Are you planning
on fighting me?

1613
01:53:55,352 --> 01:53:58,810
Go ahead. Use that cannon
you can hardly lift.

1614
01:53:58,888 --> 01:54:01,721
You can have the stone
if you let me talk to Sheeta.

1615
01:54:01,791 --> 01:54:04,453
No, Pazu! Get out of here
and throw the crystal away!

1616
01:54:04,527 --> 01:54:07,928
I'll give you one minute,
starting now.

1617
01:54:24,013 --> 01:54:26,777
Ohh, Pazu!

1618
01:54:29,352 --> 01:54:32,583
Sheeta,
listen to me very carefully.

1619
01:54:32,655 --> 01:54:34,646
Whisper the spell to me.

1620
01:54:36,393 --> 01:54:38,293
I'll say it with you.

1621
01:54:38,361 --> 01:54:41,296
Just put your hand in mine
and trust me.

1622
01:54:48,104 --> 01:54:50,800
Tell me
the spell of destruction.

1623
01:54:50,874 --> 01:54:53,308
Dola and the boys are free.
Don't worry about them.

1624
01:54:53,376 --> 01:54:55,742
Whisper the spell in my ear.

1625
01:54:57,680 --> 01:55:00,114
Time's up. What is your answer?

1626
01:55:00,183 --> 01:55:01,411
You ready?

1627
01:55:07,624 --> 01:55:09,353
Huh?

1628
01:55:11,861 --> 01:55:13,021
- Balus.
- Balus.

1629
01:55:15,231 --> 01:55:17,995
- Aah!
- Aah!

1630
01:55:18,067 --> 01:55:20,501
Aaah!

1631
01:55:41,658 --> 01:55:44,525
Aah! My eyes!

1632
01:55:44,594 --> 01:55:47,256
I can't see!

1633
01:55:53,570 --> 01:55:56,937
No! No!

1634
01:56:06,616 --> 01:56:08,743
We can't wait anymore, mom!

1635
01:56:08,818 --> 01:56:11,048
All right, then.
Let's shove off!
