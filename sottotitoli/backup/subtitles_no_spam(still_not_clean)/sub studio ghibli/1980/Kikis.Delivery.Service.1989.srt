1
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:28,153
<i>Now the latest weather forecast
for northwest Koriko.</i>

2
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:31,656
<i>Skies are clearing up,
thanks to a high-pressure front</i>

3
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,826
<i>moving in from the continent.</i>

4
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:38,413
<i>Mild winds will be
blowing in from the northwest</i>

5
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:40,832
<i>clearing out the clouds by this evening.</i>

6
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:44,335
<i>We'll also have
a beautiful full moon tonight.</i>

7
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:49,215
<i>Tomorrow: fair. Day after tomorrow: fair.</i>

8
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:53,470
<i>More news in just a minute.</i>

9
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:57,057
<i>First, a word from today's sponsor...</i>

10
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,296
Jiji, I've decided! Tonight's the night!

11
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:29,672
RING BELL FOR WITCH, KOKIRI

12
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,966
Mom!

13
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:35,762
Oh, hi, Miss Dora.
It's gonna be clear tonight.

14
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:39,682
I heard the weather forecast.
There's gonna be a big full moon.

15
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:42,769
Did you borrow your father's radio
without permission again?

16
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,521
It's okay, isn't it?

17
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,357
Happy to see you, Miss Dora.

18
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,400
Mom, my mind's made up. It's tonight.

19
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:52,112
Weren't you going to put it off a month?

20
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:54,823
But the next full moon
might be on a cloudy night.

21
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:57,242
I want to leave on the perfect night.

22
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:59,661
Kiki, wait!

23
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:06,543
My, my. What's this leaving business?

24
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:09,504
It's one of our old customs.

25
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:12,632
At 13, a witch leaves home
for a year of training.

26
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,552
Your little baby is 13?

27
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,930
My, my. Time flies so quickly, doesn't it?

28
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:22,142
I'm afraid so. But nobody
leaves home that young anymore.

29
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,395
I remember perfectly well

30
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,147
the day you arrived in this town.

31
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:30,859
A little 13-year-old girl
came down from the sky

32
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:33,570
riding a broomstick, her eyes shining.

33
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:38,032
I thought you were a bit full of yourself.

34
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:40,535
But Kiki has much to learn.

35
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:42,537
She hardly knows any of my potions.

36
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:46,166
After I'm gone,
who will make this medicine?

37
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:48,209
Sign of the times, I'm afraid.

38
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,211
Everything changes, bit by bit.

39
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:55,008
But I have to say,
nothing works as well for my rheumatism.

40
00:02:56,676 --> 00:03:00,305
You're always telling me to hurry!
Now who's the slowpoke?

41
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:05,518
I think it's better to leave
with decorum and great dignity.

42
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:10,148
If we put it off for a month, and I find
some wonderful boyfriend, then what?

43
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:11,774
We'll never leave!

44
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:15,361
I'm worried.
Once you've decided, you can't go back.

45
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:16,696
Of course. I know that.

46
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:22,493
Good. It's there. I'm so excited!
It's like getting a birthday present!

47
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:28,708
Dad!

48
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:31,711
I've decided to go away tonight!

49
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:34,213
- Tonight?
- Yeah! I just decided!

50
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:38,218
Well, yes, but what about
our camping trip for this weekend?

51
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,220
Sorry, Dad!

52
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,890
This won't do at all!

53
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,149
Yes. I'll expect you then. Thanks.

54
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:01,324
Hi, Mom. I wanted to make sure
you knew that Kiki is leaving tonight.

55
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:02,242
Yes, at midnight.

56
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:11,542
- Not bad.
- I wish it were a different color.

57
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:14,254
Witches have always worn this color.

58
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,757
Black cat, black clothes.

59
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,593
It doesn't matter
what color your dress is.

60
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:23,429
What matters is the heart inside it.

61
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:26,474
I know that having a good heart
is very important.

62
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,018
I wish I could show you
that my heart is ready.

63
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,437
Just follow that heart and keep smiling.

64
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:32,897
Okay.

65
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:37,277
Be sure to write home
as soon as you've found a place.

66
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:40,947
Dad, can I please take the radio?

67
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,116
Mom, you said I could have his radio.

68
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:46,536
- Yeah!
- Well, the radio is yours now.

69
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:50,039
Okay. Now let me have
a look at my little witch.

70
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,924
You look just like your mother.

71
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:02,010
Dad...

72
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:04,679
would you pick me up like you used to?

73
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,222
Well...

74
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,195
Why didn't you tell me
you were growing up so fast?

75
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,782
You can always come home
if things don't work out.

76
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:27,910
Come back to my old room? No, thanks.

77
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:32,999
I hope you find a good town.

78
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:48,222
I bet it's real tough to find
a town to live in by yourself.

79
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,932
Don't worry. Kiki will be fine.

80
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:53,186
- What kind of town are you looking for?
- A big town?

81
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:55,646
Yeah. By the ocean, I hope.

82
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,733
- Wow!
- I'm so jealous of you!

83
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:02,695
But I'm not going for a good time.

84
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,489
I'll be in training for a year.

85
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,616
Yeah, but they'll have discos, right?

86
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:12,789
- Kiki, it's almost time.
- Okay!

87
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:16,250
That's the broom you're taking?

88
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:19,212
Yeah. I just made it. Pretty cute, huh?

89
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:23,466
It's cute, but you can't start
on a broom that's too small. Take mine.

90
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,468
But, Mom, that one's so old.

91
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:30,765
That's why you should have it.
It never loses its way, even in a storm.

92
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:32,683
Kiki, trust me.

93
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:36,562
But I worked so hard on it. Right, Jiji?

94
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,398
Your mother's broom would be better.

95
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:41,192
Traitor.

96
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:46,697
He's right. You can make yourself
another broom when you get settled down.

97
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,497
Be careful.

98
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,624
- Go get 'em.
- Bye.

99
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:09,679
Go, go, Kiki!

100
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:13,391
Go, go, Kiki!

101
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,401
She still hasn't got the hang of it.

102
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,245
She's well past the lake
and doing just fine.

103
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:37,748
I'm going to miss the sound
of those little bells.

104
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:46,841
Which way are we headed?

105
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:48,885
I think south, to the ocean.

106
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:58,603
Climb up and turn on the radio.
I don't think I can.

107
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,612
Good evening!

108
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:34,490
It was.

109
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,742
Newcomer, I suppose.

110
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,245
I must be. I just left home tonight.

111
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,915
Would you mind turning off that music?

112
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,293
I prefer to fly without accompaniment.

113
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:52,258
Is it hard to get settled
into a place you've never been?

114
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,970
Oh, yes. Lots can go wrong.

115
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:59,265
But since I'm a fortune-teller,
I can handle anything.

116
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:00,975
Fortunes?

117
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:03,311
In fact, I've started
telling fortunes about love.

118
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,606
What's your special skill?

119
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:10,484
I haven't made up my mind yet.

120
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:13,738
Well, I'm nearly finished
with my training period.

121
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:16,407
It'll be terrific
to go home with confidence.

122
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,160
That's my town down there.

123
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,080
It's not big or very interesting,
but I like it.

124
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:26,042
- Good luck to you.
- Thanks.

125
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:29,211
Goodbye!

126
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:37,053
Disgusting. What a stuck-up cat.

127
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:38,721
I need a special skill.

128
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,354
What was that about good weather?

129
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:58,115
Don't tell me you are going to...

130
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,629
We'll sleep here until the storm passes.

131
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:14,340
- Won't we get into trouble?
- Not if nobody finds us.

132
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,932
I'm soaked through.

133
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:24,892
Do you feel anything moving?

134
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,689
This smells great.

135
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,477
Sorry. We didn't mean to fall asleep
in your breakfast.

136
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:04,533
Jiji, come see the ocean.
I don't believe it! It's huge!

137
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:09,622
- It's only a puddle to me.
- Aw, come on.

138
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:22,801
That one's giant.
Think there might be other witches there?

139
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:23,802
How would I know?

140
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,235
Let's go!

141
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,205
You all right back there?

142
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:56,168
Look. A big town floating on the sea.

143
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:27,992
Just as I hoped.
A clock tower and everything!

144
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:30,870
What if there are some witches
living here already?

145
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,162
There may not be.

146
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:14,038
- I'm gonna like it here!
- It's a trifle large for my taste.

147
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:16,832
Bless my hourglass! If that ain't a witch!

148
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,210
Good morning!

149
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,463
Are there any other witches in this town?

150
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:26,467
No. Can't say I've seen
a single one of 'em lately.

151
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:29,470
How about that?
Let's settle down right here.

152
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:32,306
- Thanks, mister! Bye!
- Don't mention it!

153
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,856
- Tell me we're not landing there.
- Of course we are.

154
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,244
Everybody's staring.

155
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:57,498
I know. Smile and make
a good first impression.

156
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:41,041
Well, you see, I'm a witch.
My name is Kiki.

157
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,876
This is my black cat, Jiji.

158
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,420
We'd be honored to live here.

159
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:52,803
We'd love to live here.
You have a wonderful bell tower.

160
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,683
We're glad you like it, my dear.

161
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:08,986
Hey, kid, why did you jump
into the street like that?

162
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:11,488
You almost caused an accident.

163
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,991
You must be crazy,
zooming around on a broom in public.

164
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,286
I'm a new witch, sir.
We're supposed to fly around.

165
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:20,122
You're supposed to obey the law
the same as other people.

166
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:21,999
What's your name and address?

167
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:26,211
- Are you gonna tell my parents?
- Of course, if it's necessary.

168
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,921
I have to. You're a minor.

169
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:32,259
Thief! Somebody stop him! Stop, thief!

170
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:33,677
Don't you move from there!

171
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,035
Kiki.

172
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,333
Wait up! It worked out pretty good, huh?

173
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,378
Good plan to get rid of that cop, huh?
I was the one yelling, "Thief!"

174
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:09,713
You're a real witch, right?

175
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,257
I saw you flying.

176
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:14,802
Could I look at that broom?

177
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:16,261
Hey, Tombo!

178
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,264
Isn't it a bit early for girl hunting?

179
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,183
Hey, you guys, shut up.

180
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:22,893
Whoa!

181
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:29,066
Let me look at your broom.
Please? Just for a minute.

182
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,318
I didn't ask for your help.

183
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:33,654
I guess I have to thank you,

184
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:37,699
but it was rude for you not to
introduce yourself first.

185
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:51,630
How old-fashioned.
You sound like my grandma.

186
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:52,965
Just leave me alone!

187
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,352
What a cool witch.

188
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,694
Stay here alone? I don't understand.
Aren't your parents here with you?

189
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:17,990
No. I'm a witch, so since I'm 13,
I'm supposed to be independent.

190
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:20,284
May I see some identification?

191
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,411
Never mind then.

192
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:40,804
- Are you going to eat that?
- You can have it.

193
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,310
It's going to be getting dark soon.

194
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,444
Let's go.

195
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:36,777
Let's just find another town.

196
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,404
There must be a nicer one.

197
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:49,581
Lady! Your pacifier!

198
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,417
Lady, you forgot this!

199
00:20:55,504 --> 00:21:00,217
When that baby wakes up
and doesn't find this, he's gonna cry.

200
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:10,185
I'm sorry, sir, but could you wait
just a minute? I'll be right back.

201
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:18,735
- I could bring it down to her.
- What?

202
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,571
The woman with the baby carriage, right?

203
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,658
That'd be a big help.

204
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,703
- Thank you very much.
- My pleasure.

205
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,205
Let's go, Jiji.

206
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:40,966
Wow!

207
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:54,229
Sorry to startle you,
but you left this in the bakery.

208
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:13,749
Here you go.

209
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,083
The usual?

210
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,085
Hi! Come on in!

211
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,343
Thank you.

212
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,263
Next!

213
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:30,974
Thank you. Bye.

214
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:35,896
Take care.

215
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:44,529
I must say, I nearly fainted
when I saw you fly off.

216
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:46,823
That lady told me to give you this.

217
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:52,662
"I got the pacifier you sent.

218
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:55,749
Thank you!"

219
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,210
I guess I should be going.

220
00:22:58,293 --> 00:22:59,127
Wait!

221
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:02,631
Where are you going so fast?
I want to thank you.

222
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:10,430
Come up here.

223
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,355
Sit down and relax.
I'll make us some coffee.

224
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:19,397
Okay.

225
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,996
- Thank you very much.
- And this is for you.

226
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:41,461
I see. You need to find your own town.

227
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:46,550
Yes, but people don't seem fond
of witches in this town.

228
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,845
There are many kinds of people
in a big town like this.

229
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:52,222
Take me, for instance.
I like you very much.

230
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:57,060
Found a place to stay yet?

231
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:04,359
You should have told me you hadn't.

232
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:07,070
We have a vacant room
in the attic you can stay in.

233
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:08,280
You'd give me a room?

234
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:12,117
I'd be happy to.

235
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,536
Let me introduce myself. I'm Osono.

236
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:17,164
My name's Kiki.

237
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:19,040
This is my black cat, Jiji.

238
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:36,308
It's not very clean, but it's all yours.

239
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:38,560
- Thanks.
- Bathroom and water are downstairs.

240
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:41,771
- Don't hesitate to ask for anything.
- Thank you!

241
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:48,403
There's flour everywhere.

242
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:04,461
At this rate,
I'll be a white cat by morning.

243
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:11,051
Jiji, come look at the ocean from here.

244
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:19,768
Shall we try to find another town?

245
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:31,655
<i>The Freedom Adventurer has commenced
its maiden voyage to Antarctica.</i>

246
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,158
What a snob.

247
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:55,679
I've decided to stay awhile.

248
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:57,264
I might find others like Osono

249
00:25:57,347 --> 00:26:00,725
who will like me
and accept me for what I am.

250
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:58,301
How much do you think
it would cost to install a phone?

251
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:01,346
- A phone?
- Yeah. For my business.

252
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:24,494
Good morning.

253
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:26,496
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes!

254
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:29,207
That smells good. Can I help out?

255
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,333
Sure.

256
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,565
A delivery service, huh?

257
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:56,693
I have one skill, flying,

258
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:58,987
so I thought about a delivery service.

259
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:02,490
Everyone will love it.
Kiki's Flying Delivery Service.

260
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:06,494
And you can base the business
out of your room upstairs.

261
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:07,704
Really?

262
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:09,330
Thank you.

263
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:13,960
- I'd like to put a phone up there.
- But a phone costs money.

264
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:16,921
- I have some saved up already.
- Don't waste it.

265
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:20,341
Why not use our phone?

266
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:22,927
It takes time to get regular customers.

267
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:27,599
If you help around the bakery, you won't
have to pay rent or the phone bill.

268
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:29,934
I need the help
since I'm expecting a baby.

269
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:32,270
I'll throw in free breakfast too.

270
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,731
Thank you!

271
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:36,649
I'll do my very best for you.

272
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:40,904
You're such a wonderful person!

273
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,771
Jiji, come on! I'm all done!

274
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:18,608
It's time to go shopping.

275
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:37,919
Stop jumping out into the street.
We're not at home.

276
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:40,255
I'm sorry. I won't do it again.

277
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:45,593
I've never been more embarrassed
in my whole life.

278
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:46,886
It was so terrible!

279
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:50,765
Oh, please.

280
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:59,649
I wish I had something pretty to wear.

281
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:11,327
Boy, this is expensive.

282
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:13,663
Kiki, look!

283
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:28,469
Is there any money left?

284
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:32,181
We'll just have to eat
pancakes for a while.

285
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:46,237
Wow! Those are beautiful.

286
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:56,331
Wait! Pull over a second!

287
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,126
Miss Witch!

288
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:04,881
Not flying today?

289
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,761
What'd I tell you? Black is all she wears.

290
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:13,348
Wait! Come back! I'm sorry!
I was only kidding!

291
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,487
Perfect timing, Kiki.

292
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:31,366
A lady wants you to deliver something.
She's your first customer.

293
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,576
Customer? I'll be right back!

294
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:39,332
The map!

295
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,346
This lady is a customer of ours.

296
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:56,057
We were talking about
your delivery service.

297
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:59,227
- You are a cute little witch.
- My name's Kiki, ma'am.

298
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:03,189
Could you deliver this by tonight?

299
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:05,775
Yes!

300
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:08,486
It's my nephew's birthday.

301
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:11,322
But I can't get there myself
to give him his present.

302
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:13,116
Where do you want it delivered?

303
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,037
That's me.

304
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:20,331
It won't be too far?

305
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,500
I can fly directly from here.

306
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:26,045
- How much do you want?
- I haven't set a price yet.

307
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:28,715
Is this enough?

308
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:36,097
This is more than enough.
Thank you, ma'am.

309
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:53,364
Up we go!

310
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,582
Oh, wow! That's great!

311
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:04,667
I wish I could fly.

312
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:07,003
Yeah! Hey, do you know that girl?

313
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:28,357
How high do you intend to go?

314
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:32,236
It's my first delivery. I don't want
to be stopped by that police officer.

315
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:37,450
I was afraid you were going to
deliver it to the angels.

316
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:45,249
It's just beyond the cape.

317
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:49,003
Here we go!

318
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,680
I'm liking this town more and more.

319
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,349
I'm not sure what I think.

320
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,352
I'll finally be able to write to Mom.

321
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:25,832
Those are wild geese. Wonderful!

322
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:30,962
They're flying along with us!

323
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:59,282
- They seem awfully upset.
- They say a wind's coming.

324
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:01,576
They also say they're going higher.

325
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:19,218
Oh, no!

326
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,616
I'm sorry. I... Ow!

327
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:49,916
Please! I'm sorry!
I wasn't trying to steal your eggs!

328
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:00,718
I've never been so scared.

329
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:04,889
It's your fault. They warned us
of that wind, but you didn't listen.

330
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:05,806
You're right.

331
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:13,564
That's beautiful. They were able
to fly that high up with the wind.

332
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:14,815
Kiki!

333
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:16,734
The toy is gone!

334
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,694
Oh no!

335
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:20,613
- Maybe it's when we fell?
- Yeah!

336
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:37,672
They're saying:
"The egg thief's coming again!"

337
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,465
What are we gonna do?

338
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:57,275
Hey! Stop that!

339
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:59,277
Don't do that!

340
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:02,029
Stop it!

341
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,085
We're in trouble. They're still upset.

342
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:19,046
Witches get no respect these days.

343
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,632
Crows used to be witches' servants.

344
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,926
That was a long time ago, okay?

345
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:27,930
How about we go get it after dark?

346
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:30,766
We'll never make it in time.

347
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:33,728
There's only one way to do it.

348
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,730
They'll find out I'm a fake!

349
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:39,066
After I find it,
I'll be right back to help you out.

350
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:45,573
- Is that the place?
- Yes. Don't move a muscle.

351
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,783
- Can I breathe?
- Hold it as long as you can.

352
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:07,803
Yeah! Give me my present!

353
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:12,183
That's pretty weird.

354
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:19,774
A bit late, aren't you?

355
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:22,234
After my sister rang,
we wondered where you were.

356
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:23,444
I'm sorry.

357
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,658
Could you please sign here?

358
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:34,246
Mom, can I put the canary in here?

359
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:37,083
Okay, but be careful not to let it escape.

360
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:38,084
Okay.

361
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,255
Thank you very much.

362
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:56,352
Come on, birdie!

363
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,730
I'm gonna put you in a bigger house!

364
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:04,985
Please hurry, Kiki.

365
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:38,769
I know it was here,
so it must be around someplace.

366
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,452
There it is!

367
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:01,167
Excuse me! Anybody home?

368
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:04,044
Can you please help me? Anybody?

369
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,179
Anybody here?

370
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:16,265
Yeah! I can't come down right now.

371
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:20,186
Why don't you come up?

372
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:33,240
What do you want?

373
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:36,952
That stuffed black cat
you put on your window sill?

374
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:38,412
Sorry, but it's mine. I dropped it.

375
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:42,708
Be good, and don't move yet.

376
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:47,421
I found it in the forest.

377
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:50,341
Would you give it back to me, please?

378
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:53,135
Hang on. I can't stop just now.

379
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:56,388
Nice. Very nice.

380
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:59,475
You're beautiful just how you are.

381
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:11,654
You really should have told me
you were in a hurry.

382
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:18,118
- I got sort of fond of it.
- I'm sorry.

383
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:22,289
The stuffing is coming out.

384
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:25,334
I'll bet the crows did it.
They made such a fuss.

385
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:28,337
What will I do?
I can't deliver it like this.

386
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:33,676
Say! How about we work out a deal?

387
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:38,180
That's pretty exciting. And at 13 too.

388
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:41,350
To be independent. That's great.

389
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:44,520
- Can you fix it?
- Trust me.

390
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:53,654
Ketto, time for your bath.

391
00:42:56,991 --> 00:43:01,078
Quickly! The guests will be here soon!

392
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:04,540
Ketto!

393
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:06,477
- I'm done.
- Thank you so much!

394
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:09,480
You'd better help Jiji
before it's too late.

395
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:12,983
- But I haven't finished yet.
- You've done enough. Go help him.

396
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:14,818
Thanks!

397
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:27,915
Jeff likes my present more than me!

398
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:30,084
It is strange.

399
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:33,420
He adores that stuffed cat.
He won't leave it alone.

400
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:35,381
He thinks it's a puppy.

401
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:38,050
Your sister's not going to be
happy to hear that.

402
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:41,053
That's okay. I gave it to Jeff anyway.

403
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:43,389
- Remember to thank your auntie.
- I will!

404
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:46,934
You should be nicer to him.

405
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:49,103
Jeff is a very old dog.

406
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:51,563
But, Grandma, all he does is sleep!

407
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:54,358
I suppose that's true.

408
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:57,945
- Ketto, open the door for Jeff.
- Okay.

409
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:02,533
Push the door shut when you're finished.

410
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:14,753
- Jiji!
- Kiki, what took you so long?

411
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:15,838
I'm sorry.

412
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:18,757
That marvelous dog helped me escape.

413
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:27,349
He said he'd be happy to help us out.

414
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:36,442
Would you take this back in?

415
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:08,599
What's the matter?

416
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:11,518
- I'm famished.
- Yeah, me too.

417
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:12,978
And I'm tired too.

418
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:15,063
But it was a wonderful adventure.

419
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:17,941
And that painter who found the stuffed cat

420
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:20,110
wants to do a drawing with me in it.

421
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:21,570
- Naked?
- Don't be silly!

422
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:34,166
{\an8}KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE

423
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:58,875
Boring.

424
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:10,220
Hey! Aren't you supposed to be
minding the shop?

425
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:13,015
I am, but nobody's coming in today.

426
00:48:13,098 --> 00:48:15,183
But it always gets busy around now.

427
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:18,353
I know, but I mean my customers.

428
00:48:18,895 --> 00:48:23,358
Jiji, if nobody comes in,
I'll have to eat pancakes forever

429
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:28,030
and be fat, fat, fat!

430
00:48:28,113 --> 00:48:30,449
So, what am I supposed to do?

431
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:33,452
I think pancakes are great,
provided they're not burnt.

432
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:38,665
You're no help.
When you get fat, see if I care.

433
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:49,217
Beautiful, isn't she?
I heard she's a fashion designer.

434
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:52,471
Personally, I'm not very fond
of her conceited cat.

435
00:48:56,224 --> 00:48:58,435
Hello. Gutiokipan Bakery.

436
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:00,646
Pardon? Yes, ma'am.

437
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:03,023
About time we got a customer.

438
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:06,985
4:30 will be a perfect time to pick it up.

439
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:09,154
And the address?

440
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:12,491
Yes. The blue roof. Right.

441
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:15,118
Yes, I'm sure I have it all.

442
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:17,120
Thank you very much.

443
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:21,583
Hi.

444
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:30,842
I'll take this one.

445
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:33,679
Okay?

446
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:40,769
Thank you very much.

447
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:43,438
Are you still mad at me?

448
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:45,691
We're having a party at the club tonight.

449
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:49,945
It's called the Flying Club,
and we'd really like you to come.

450
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:51,655
Here's your invitation.

451
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:57,577
It really is a serious club.

452
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:00,872
Everybody would be very happy if you came.

453
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:02,499
May I help you?

454
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:05,502
They tell me you have a delivery service.

455
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:08,296
Pardon me. Yes, of course we do.

456
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:11,425
This urgent package must arrive tonight.
Can you do it?

457
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:13,301
Of course we can...

458
00:50:14,636 --> 00:50:15,929
Will you be all right?

459
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:18,265
Can I help you?

460
00:50:34,906 --> 00:50:38,869
I'll be back at 6:00,
so make up your mind by then.

461
00:50:39,327 --> 00:50:40,537
How much will that be?

462
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:43,206
Will that be inside
or outside the city limits?

463
00:50:43,331 --> 00:50:46,752
- I wrote it down on the box.
- The box? Oh, I'm sorry.

464
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:51,673
Osono!

465
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:55,218
I got an invitation to a party
at Tombo's flying club.

466
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:57,179
Terrific! You'll have a lovely time.

467
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,681
But what am I gonna wear?

468
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:04,436
Kiki, I wouldn't worry too much.
You look fine in that.

469
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:06,438
You look beautiful and mysterious.

470
00:51:07,063 --> 00:51:08,774
- You mean it?
- Any work yet?

471
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:10,400
I almost forgot about it!

472
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:12,903
It's already 4:00! Oh, no!

473
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:16,573
Can you watch the store 'til I get back?

474
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:19,075
Jiji!

475
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:38,220
Why are you going to this party
when you're so mad at him?

476
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:41,932
I have to concentrate.
This thing is heavy. Be quiet.

477
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:03,078
Thank you.

478
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:04,704
Come on!

479
00:52:09,876 --> 00:52:12,128
Our next appointment is at 4:30.

480
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:27,727
The blue roof.

481
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:51,167
My name's Kiki. Someone telephoned
for a delivery service, so here I am.

482
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:53,587
Right this way, dear.

483
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:03,096
- You're right on time.
- Yes, ma'am.

484
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:09,853
Madam, the delivery girl is here.

485
00:53:11,062 --> 00:53:13,481
What? Oh, my goodness!

486
00:53:13,982 --> 00:53:17,944
Is it that time already?

487
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:20,155
- Come, come.
- Thanks.

488
00:53:20,238 --> 00:53:22,115
May I take that for you?

489
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:32,667
Broom and a black cat.

490
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:35,962
It's just like my great-grandmother
always told me.

491
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:39,090
My name is Kiki, and I'm a witch.

492
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:43,720
Oh, and what a cute little girl you are.

493
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:47,349
I'm so sorry,
but that pie you were supposed

494
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:49,351
to deliver isn't ready yet.

495
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:54,481
The temperature
doesn't seem to go up at all.

496
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:56,107
Something's wrong.

497
00:53:59,152 --> 00:54:02,572
Machines don't work
when they become old like me.

498
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:06,826
I was hoping you could deliver it hot
to my grandchild's birthday party.

499
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:11,831
It's one of my favorite recipes:
herring and pumpkin pie.

500
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:14,334
I guess I have to admit defeat.

501
00:54:14,876 --> 00:54:17,045
I'll have to call and tell her I'm sorry.

502
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:20,256
I feel just awful
having you come here for nothing.

503
00:54:20,882 --> 00:54:23,593
Bertha!

504
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:27,514
Would you get her money, please?

505
00:54:28,264 --> 00:54:29,099
Certainly, ma'am.

506
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:32,143
All of it.
Pay her the amount we agreed on.

507
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:34,813
- Oh, no. Please!
- Now, don't be silly.

508
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:36,898
It's not your fault it wasn't ready.

509
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:42,612
I have no other jobs today.
Maybe I could help.

510
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:44,197
Does that oven work?

511
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:47,033
You mean that one?

512
00:54:48,868 --> 00:54:52,706
It used to be the only one I ever used,
but I haven't opened it in years.

513
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:57,460
If it burns firewood, I can help.
I used to help my mom all the time.

514
00:54:58,169 --> 00:55:00,213
It's a big job to build a fire.

515
00:55:00,296 --> 00:55:01,798
It's a great idea, madam.

516
00:55:01,881 --> 00:55:05,969
I never did like that electric thing,
and we have plenty of firewood.

517
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:07,220
I can build a fire.

518
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:09,055
Well, I'm not sure,

519
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:11,766
but if you think you can do it...

520
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:19,357
But won't this make you late
for your party?

521
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:21,359
I can't take money for nothing.

522
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:30,952
Come on. We must hurry.

523
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:35,707
Look what I found. And it works!

524
00:55:36,249 --> 00:55:40,086
You're very good at this, my dear.
Your mother taught you well.

525
00:55:50,096 --> 00:55:51,973
Oh, my goodness, it's so exciting.

526
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:54,976
Never did like electricity.

527
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:11,034
It should be about time.

528
00:56:11,409 --> 00:56:13,203
Yes, very good. Well done.

529
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:26,508
And now we wait.

530
00:56:26,591 --> 00:56:29,719
- About 40 minutes or so. Right?
- Exactly right.

531
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:33,848
- So why don't we take a little break?
- Do you need help with anything else?

532
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:37,852
Oh! Well, if you'd really like to...

533
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:40,313
Thanks very much.

534
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:42,107
You're very welcome.

535
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:47,320
- You're going to be late for the party.
- Stop worrying.

536
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:50,657
It'll only take me 15 minutes
if I fly there fast.

537
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:55,203
Would you care for some tea?
I just made a pot.

538
00:56:57,497 --> 00:57:00,166
I just remembered.
Won't you be late for your party?

539
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:03,211
It won't be a problem.
It'll take me 15 minutes from here.

540
00:57:05,296 --> 00:57:08,049
But, my dear, that clock runs
about ten minutes slow.

541
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:12,137
- What'll I do?
- See if the pie is ready.

542
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:13,179
Okay.

543
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:15,223
Bertha!

544
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:27,444
- Is the pie ready?
- It smells fine, so you'd better hurry.

545
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:28,862
Okay.

546
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:37,954
Better hurry!

547
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:40,832
- Okay.
- Don't forget your money.

548
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:44,502
- That's way too much.
- Not for what you've done.

549
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:46,546
Hurry up, Kiki, or you'll be late!

550
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:50,300
- Have a good time!
- Be careful!

551
00:57:56,931 --> 00:57:59,642
What happened to all that good weather?

552
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:01,352
My whiskers are tingling.

553
00:58:25,793 --> 00:58:29,714
- Could we get out of the rain?
- We can't! That'll only make us later!

554
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:31,633
Besides, the pie will get cold.

555
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:36,030
Yes?

556
00:59:36,489 --> 00:59:37,991
I have a delivery.

557
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:39,659
But it's completely wet.

558
00:59:40,785 --> 00:59:44,330
I'm sorry. It began to rain on the way.
But the food is all right.

559
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:47,959
- I told Grandma I didn't want that.
- Who is it?

560
00:59:48,042 --> 00:59:50,628
Grandma sent another of
her crummy herring pies!

561
00:59:52,463 --> 00:59:55,133
Would you please sign this receipt for me?

562
00:59:57,051 --> 00:59:59,137
I hate Grandma's stupid pies.

563
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:07,395
She can't possibly be her granddaughter.

564
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:22,744
Do you think we can still make it in time?

565
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:48,394
Look! Tombo's down there!

566
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:50,813
We can still make it.

567
01:00:57,487 --> 01:00:59,113
That was quite an ordeal.

568
01:00:59,447 --> 01:01:01,366
That boy waited a very long time.

569
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:04,619
Doesn't matter anyway.
I can't go in wet clothes.

570
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:18,883
Kiki, what's wrong?

571
01:01:18,966 --> 01:01:20,468
Do you have a headache?

572
01:01:22,387 --> 01:01:25,473
Why don't we grab a bite to eat?
I know I'm famished.

573
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:54,085
Kiki!

574
01:02:15,648 --> 01:02:17,275
Not feeling very well, huh?

575
01:02:20,361 --> 01:02:21,821
You have quite a fever.

576
01:02:22,113 --> 01:02:24,282
Is someone pounding on my head?

577
01:02:24,365 --> 01:02:27,160
I'll bet you didn't dry yourself off
completely yesterday.

578
01:02:28,536 --> 01:02:30,663
Am I gonna shrivel up and die?

579
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:37,712
You have a cold, is all.
I'll bring up some medicine.

580
01:02:37,795 --> 01:02:39,964
And you should eat something.

581
01:02:40,548 --> 01:02:41,424
I'm not hungry.

582
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:44,552
It'll be better if you eat now.

583
01:02:44,635 --> 01:02:47,263
How about some oatmeal? Like some, Jiji?

584
01:02:52,977 --> 01:02:55,146
Oatmeal is the best thing for a cold.

585
01:02:56,147 --> 01:02:57,690
There you go.

586
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:01,068
Don't burn your tongue.

587
01:03:04,989 --> 01:03:08,159
Come and eat your oatmeal
before it gets cold.

588
01:03:09,076 --> 01:03:10,828
Do I have to eat?

589
01:03:10,912 --> 01:03:12,163
If you want to get well.

590
01:03:12,955 --> 01:03:15,666
That boy was in the shop a while ago.

591
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:21,506
When I told him you were sick,
he asked how a witch could catch a cold.

592
01:03:23,591 --> 01:03:26,344
Oh, yes. He said he wanted
to visit you a little later.

593
01:03:26,427 --> 01:03:27,470
Oh, no!

594
01:03:28,971 --> 01:03:32,266
I figured you might say that,
so I politely refused.

595
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:34,852
You're tired. Just relax and sleep.

596
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:38,815
I'll open the window for some air.

597
01:03:46,405 --> 01:03:47,990
- Osono...
- Hmm?

598
01:03:50,034 --> 01:03:51,285
Never mind.

599
01:04:19,814 --> 01:04:20,648
Jiji!

600
01:04:21,816 --> 01:04:23,317
Jiji!

601
01:04:24,318 --> 01:04:25,444
What?

602
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:55,182
Jiji! Breakfast is ready!

603
01:04:55,266 --> 01:04:56,350
Kiki?

604
01:04:56,934 --> 01:05:00,021
- Feeling better this morning?
- Much better, thank you.

605
01:05:00,104 --> 01:05:02,481
I'm sorry. I didn't realize I'd overslept.

606
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:03,774
That's okay.

607
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:06,944
Come down here later.
I have a favor to ask of you.

608
01:05:07,028 --> 01:05:07,862
Okay.

609
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:10,364
"Koppori." Is that right?

610
01:05:10,448 --> 01:05:12,074
Yes. Is this enough money?

611
01:05:12,992 --> 01:05:15,077
Don't worry. It's close enough to walk.

612
01:05:15,536 --> 01:05:17,705
Don't be silly. Work is work.

613
01:05:17,997 --> 01:05:19,957
Be sure to deliver it to him directly.

614
01:05:23,002 --> 01:05:24,003
Jiji!

615
01:05:25,087 --> 01:05:28,049
- You have work?
- It's not far away.

616
01:05:28,341 --> 01:05:29,258
Who's your friend?

617
01:05:30,134 --> 01:05:32,261
Lily's her name. I'll come down.

618
01:05:33,012 --> 01:05:36,265
Don't worry. I'll be back in a minute.
Pleasure to meet you, Lily.

619
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:25,982
Wonderful.

620
01:06:35,574 --> 01:06:37,743
Hey! Miss Witch!

621
01:06:41,455 --> 01:06:42,498
Taking a walk?

622
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,668
I'm looking for someone named Koppori.

623
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:48,170
Hey, that's my name!

624
01:06:48,629 --> 01:06:49,547
What?

625
01:06:50,756 --> 01:06:53,009
Go around that way.
I'll be right with you.

626
01:06:57,555 --> 01:06:58,806
I'll bet Osono planned this.

627
01:07:04,979 --> 01:07:05,896
Gee, thanks a lot.

628
01:07:10,818 --> 01:07:13,821
I want to apologize
for making you wait the other night.

629
01:07:15,531 --> 01:07:17,324
I'm sorry you got wet.

630
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:21,162
Want to come over to my place?
I have something to show you.

631
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:24,373
Come on! Hurry!

632
01:07:28,377 --> 01:07:30,796
The party was to celebrate
the completion of this.

633
01:07:33,382 --> 01:07:35,551
It's the engine
of a human-propelled plane.

634
01:07:36,343 --> 01:07:37,261
Like it?

635
01:07:39,346 --> 01:07:42,349
We're assembling the wings
and the frame at a friend's house.

636
01:07:42,808 --> 01:07:46,103
I'm planning on flying this thing
during my summer vacation.

637
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:55,071
Hey! Let's go see where
that dirigible landed!

638
01:07:56,030 --> 01:07:56,906
"Dirigible"?

639
01:07:57,156 --> 01:07:59,158
You didn't see it on TV?

640
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:01,911
- I was sleeping.
- Then we have to go!

641
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:05,039
- We're going with this?
- Why not?

642
01:08:05,122 --> 01:08:08,167
I have to practice anyway.
Gotta build up my legs.

643
01:08:09,335 --> 01:08:10,544
Okay. Ready?

644
01:08:17,009 --> 01:08:18,803
I've never ridden a bicycle before.

645
01:08:18,886 --> 01:08:21,055
Oh, boy! Even better!

646
01:08:21,138 --> 01:08:24,725
Brace the bike with your foot
until I get her revved up. Let's go!

647
01:08:31,899 --> 01:08:33,567
Kick off!

648
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:44,995
- Should I get off?
- No!

649
01:09:12,106 --> 01:09:13,524
Go faster! Go!

650
01:09:13,607 --> 01:09:15,609
That's great! Hang in there!

651
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:22,783
Swing your body to the inside
when we go around the bend.

652
01:09:22,867 --> 01:09:25,161
Otherwise, it won't turn very well.

653
01:09:27,454 --> 01:09:28,747
Now!

654
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:33,919
Great! You're doing fine!

655
01:09:43,554 --> 01:09:45,514
Yippee! Great!

656
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:57,651
- The dirigible, right?
- Right.

657
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:08,078
We're flying!

658
01:10:35,522 --> 01:10:37,566
Tombo, are you okay?

659
01:10:38,275 --> 01:10:40,277
- Yeah. Are you all right?
- I'm okay.

660
01:11:01,757 --> 01:11:03,509
Does my face look that funny?

661
01:11:05,386 --> 01:11:09,431
I'm sorry, but when we flew
over that cliff, I was so scared!

662
01:11:13,894 --> 01:11:15,104
I was scared too.

663
01:11:16,146 --> 01:11:18,399
I'll bet you used some magic.

664
01:11:18,482 --> 01:11:20,693
I'm not sure. I was so frightened.

665
01:11:20,776 --> 01:11:23,612
Your poor bike. It's a mess.

666
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:28,117
Oh, no! I'm in trouble!

667
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:31,537
- Will you look after the bike for me?
- What's wrong?

668
01:11:32,037 --> 01:11:34,373
I pedaled too hard!

669
01:11:35,082 --> 01:11:36,375
Wait there!

670
01:11:58,147 --> 01:12:02,359
Sure would be terrific to go around
the world in a dirigible like that.

671
01:12:02,443 --> 01:12:05,279
How'd it make you feel,
the first time you flew?

672
01:12:05,738 --> 01:12:08,324
I can't recall.
I was too young to remember.

673
01:12:08,407 --> 01:12:11,076
But my mom told me I wasn't scared a bit.

674
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:15,080
I wish I was born into a witch family.

675
01:12:15,706 --> 01:12:17,916
You can just fly away
on a broomstick, but...

676
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,252
This is all I can do.

677
01:12:22,546 --> 01:12:25,466
I don't find flying that much fun.
It's more of a job to me.

678
01:12:26,091 --> 01:12:29,470
But I think it's wonderful that
you can put your talents to work.

679
01:12:29,928 --> 01:12:31,972
I sort of feel my confidence slipping.

680
01:12:32,639 --> 01:12:36,643
But I'm glad I came with you today.
I feel better sitting by the ocean.

681
01:12:36,727 --> 01:12:40,481
I could bring you here anytime you want
and train myself at the same time.

682
01:12:40,731 --> 01:12:43,942
- You're a very nice person.
- You just found out?

683
01:12:44,026 --> 01:12:45,944
I used to think you were a clown.

684
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:48,155
My mom says the same thing.

685
01:12:48,238 --> 01:12:52,493
"You clown! Quit looking up to the sky
and get back to your books!"

686
01:12:57,623 --> 01:12:59,333
- Tombo!
- Huh?

687
01:13:02,461 --> 01:13:05,172
- Hey! Guess what!
- What?

688
01:13:05,255 --> 01:13:07,549
Something good! Come here!

689
01:13:07,674 --> 01:13:08,842
I'll be back. Wait here.

690
01:13:13,263 --> 01:13:15,349
They said we could go inside. Coming?

691
01:13:15,432 --> 01:13:17,643
They what? Wow! Of course!

692
01:13:17,726 --> 01:13:19,436
Hey, who's your girlfriend?

693
01:13:19,812 --> 01:13:22,981
That's Kiki the Witch. Come on over, Kiki!

694
01:13:23,524 --> 01:13:26,360
They're gonna show us around
inside that dirigible!

695
01:13:27,027 --> 01:13:27,986
No, thanks.

696
01:13:28,487 --> 01:13:30,280
Ah, come on. It'll be fun.

697
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:34,201
The delivery girl.
I'm positive that's her.

698
01:13:34,284 --> 01:13:37,246
- You mean she's a working girl?
- My, how independent.

699
01:13:38,330 --> 01:13:40,207
Come on. I'll introduce you.

700
01:13:40,290 --> 01:13:41,959
No, thanks. See you later.

701
01:13:42,793 --> 01:13:43,710
What's the matter?

702
01:13:46,338 --> 01:13:47,464
Hey!

703
01:13:48,549 --> 01:13:49,925
What are you so mad about?

704
01:13:50,175 --> 01:13:51,802
I'm not mad at all.

705
01:13:51,885 --> 01:13:54,346
I have a lot of work to do,
so just leave me alone.

706
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:01,353
Tombo, let's go!

707
01:15:38,659 --> 01:15:41,495
I think something's wrong with me.

708
01:15:41,578 --> 01:15:45,040
I make friends, then suddenly,
I can't bear to be with any of them.

709
01:15:45,749 --> 01:15:48,627
That other me, the cheerful, honest me,
went off somewhere.

710
01:15:58,720 --> 01:15:59,972
Some friend you are.

711
01:16:31,628 --> 01:16:34,172
Jiji, I don't care
if you do have a girlfriend.

712
01:16:34,256 --> 01:16:36,466
You can't be late for every meal.

713
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:38,427
And clean up after yourself.

714
01:16:40,178 --> 01:16:42,180
What are you talking like a cat for?

715
01:16:50,355 --> 01:16:51,189
Jiji.

716
01:16:51,815 --> 01:16:53,483
Oh, no! Talk to me!

717
01:16:53,859 --> 01:16:55,444
Can't you speak anymore?

718
01:16:59,823 --> 01:17:00,699
Jiji!

719
01:17:01,366 --> 01:17:02,701
I wonder what happened.

720
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:05,662
I can't figure out a word he says anymore.

721
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:07,581
Oh, my gosh!

722
01:17:31,813 --> 01:17:33,523
I'm losing my powers.

723
01:18:33,083 --> 01:18:36,169
You can't fly anymore?
Have you lost your magic?

724
01:18:36,837 --> 01:18:38,422
It has become very weak,

725
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:41,425
so I think I should take a break
from delivery work.

726
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:45,971
But I'll work really hard in the bakery,
so please let me stay in my room.

727
01:18:46,972 --> 01:18:48,682
Of course you can stay.

728
01:18:48,765 --> 01:18:50,475
Will your powers come back?

729
01:18:51,601 --> 01:18:54,479
I don't know. Maybe.
I can make another broom, but...

730
01:18:59,818 --> 01:19:00,694
Look!

731
01:19:36,354 --> 01:19:38,273
Kiki! It's me, Tombo.

732
01:19:38,356 --> 01:19:41,026
Did you see me?
I was waving at you from the dirigible.

733
01:19:41,109 --> 01:19:43,653
The captain took me on the test flight.

734
01:19:43,737 --> 01:19:45,280
It was great!

735
01:19:46,031 --> 01:19:48,116
<i>Hello? Kiki, are you there?</i>

736
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:49,701
Please don't call me anymore.

737
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:54,539
<i>What? I can barely hear you.
The captain said he'd like to meet you.</i>

738
01:19:55,499 --> 01:19:57,000
Hey, come on! Don't hang up!

739
01:20:00,837 --> 01:20:02,881
What's wrong? You don't look very well.

740
01:20:04,174 --> 01:20:06,343
I'm still training to be a witch.

741
01:20:06,468 --> 01:20:10,764
If I lose my magic, that means
I've lost absolutely everything.

742
01:20:39,376 --> 01:20:40,377
Kiki!

743
01:20:42,212 --> 01:20:43,255
Hi!

744
01:20:45,674 --> 01:20:49,302
You didn't come pay me a visit,
so I had to come visit you.

745
01:20:49,386 --> 01:20:52,931
- I'm sorry.
- Well, I also came to shop a little.

746
01:20:53,598 --> 01:20:56,184
Come on in. I'm done now.
We can take a break.

747
01:20:56,726 --> 01:20:58,186
You'd better believe I will.

748
01:21:02,524 --> 01:21:05,068
- Nice place you have.
- Help yourself to these.

749
01:21:05,151 --> 01:21:08,488
- I'll make some fresh tea.
- No tea, thanks. Do you have some milk?

750
01:21:08,572 --> 01:21:09,406
Sure.

751
01:21:16,121 --> 01:21:19,374
Positively amazing.
The spitting image of that stuffed cat.

752
01:21:19,833 --> 01:21:21,251
You're Jiji, right?

753
01:21:24,337 --> 01:21:26,131
How's the home delivery business?

754
01:21:30,385 --> 01:21:31,511
That bad, huh?

755
01:21:31,970 --> 01:21:33,930
- I'm taking a break right now.
- I see.

756
01:21:43,815 --> 01:21:46,026
I thought you seemed down.

757
01:21:46,526 --> 01:21:48,653
I didn't know that happened to witches.

758
01:21:55,535 --> 01:21:57,662
Why not come and stay at my place?

759
01:21:59,956 --> 01:22:03,335
Tell your boss you need a break.
They'll manage somehow.

760
01:22:03,710 --> 01:22:05,003
How about it, Jiji?

761
01:22:10,383 --> 01:22:11,968
Rather be with your girlfriend?

762
01:22:12,052 --> 01:22:13,803
Come on! Let's go!

763
01:22:25,315 --> 01:22:26,191
Hurry! It's leaving!

764
01:23:17,492 --> 01:23:19,244
I'm bushed!

765
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:21,955
It's so beautiful.

766
01:23:32,173 --> 01:23:35,844
Must've been blind,
with two beautiful girls in front of him.

767
01:23:58,742 --> 01:24:01,536
What do you mean, you thought I was a boy?

768
01:24:01,619 --> 01:24:03,496
Well, look at the way you're dressed.

769
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:07,584
Tell me what kind of boy
has these legs, mister.

770
01:24:15,633 --> 01:24:18,178
- Crows!
- We've become real close friends.

771
01:24:18,261 --> 01:24:19,429
Really?

772
01:24:20,513 --> 01:24:22,557
Hello, everybody. We're home again.

773
01:24:22,891 --> 01:24:25,560
Good afternoon.
I'm sorry I bothered you before.

774
01:24:30,815 --> 01:24:33,359
Make yourself at home
while I get some water.

775
01:25:29,415 --> 01:25:30,333
Like it?

776
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:31,835
Wonderful.

777
01:25:32,335 --> 01:25:34,921
I got the idea for it
after we met the first time.

778
01:25:36,047 --> 01:25:38,842
But I really haven't got
the girl's face right.

779
01:25:40,468 --> 01:25:42,762
I've been waiting for you to come back.

780
01:25:42,846 --> 01:25:44,806
- You mean, that's me?
- Yes.

781
01:25:45,390 --> 01:25:47,433
Would you be my model?

782
01:25:48,017 --> 01:25:49,644
But I'm not beautiful.

783
01:25:55,066 --> 01:25:58,736
You've got a great face. Besides,
it's prettier than it was the last time.

784
01:25:59,070 --> 01:26:01,322
Come on. Have a seat. Right there.

785
01:26:06,119 --> 01:26:07,453
Lift up your head a little.

786
01:26:07,579 --> 01:26:10,748
Look beyond the horizon.
Don't move. Very good.

787
01:26:12,333 --> 01:26:14,586
Painting and magic seem to be similar.

788
01:26:15,044 --> 01:26:19,424
- Sometimes, I can't paint a thing.
- You mean it? Then what happens?

789
01:26:19,716 --> 01:26:21,301
Kiki, don't look over here.

790
01:26:24,762 --> 01:26:27,849
Without even thinking about it,
I used to be able to fly.

791
01:26:28,349 --> 01:26:31,769
Now, I can't even begin to remember
how I ever managed to do it.

792
01:26:34,439 --> 01:26:36,649
At times like that,
you know what I do? Paint.

793
01:26:36,733 --> 01:26:38,651
That gets rid of my frustrations.

794
01:26:39,444 --> 01:26:43,198
- But still, if I can't fly...
- Then I just stop.

795
01:26:44,115 --> 01:26:46,326
Take long walks,
look at the view, doze off at noon.

796
01:26:46,451 --> 01:26:47,535
Don't do anything.

797
01:26:48,786 --> 01:26:50,705
Then, suddenly, I can paint again.

798
01:26:51,372 --> 01:26:52,207
Maybe that'll help.

799
01:26:52,749 --> 01:26:55,460
Trust me. It'll happen.
Come on, don't ruin the pose.

800
01:27:16,606 --> 01:27:20,860
When I was your age,
I'd already decided to become an artist.

801
01:27:21,402 --> 01:27:24,614
I loved painting.
So much that I couldn't sleep.

802
01:27:25,156 --> 01:27:27,909
Then one day, for no reason,
I couldn't paint.

803
01:27:29,244 --> 01:27:30,995
I kept painting, but it was no good.

804
01:27:33,164 --> 01:27:36,542
I realized that I was just
imitating other painters.

805
01:27:37,252 --> 01:27:39,128
Just copies of paintings I'd seen.

806
01:27:40,255 --> 01:27:42,423
I swore I'd paint my own pictures.

807
01:27:43,758 --> 01:27:44,759
That must've been hard.

808
01:27:46,636 --> 01:27:49,889
But after that...
it's not much easier now.

809
01:27:50,431 --> 01:27:53,768
I think I found what painting means,
at least for me.

810
01:27:56,062 --> 01:27:58,773
To fly, you don't chant
a spell or something, right?

811
01:27:59,774 --> 01:28:00,775
We fly with our spirit.

812
01:28:01,734 --> 01:28:04,904
A witch's spirit? Perfect!
That's what I'm talking about.

813
01:28:05,822 --> 01:28:07,865
A witch's spirit. An artist's spirit.

814
01:28:07,949 --> 01:28:09,367
A baker's spirit!

815
01:28:10,618 --> 01:28:13,371
I suppose it must be a power given by God.

816
01:28:13,746 --> 01:28:15,748
Sometimes, you suffer for it.

817
01:28:17,166 --> 01:28:20,044
I guess I never gave witchcraft
much thought.

818
01:28:20,837 --> 01:28:23,631
That talk about discipline and training
was so old-fashioned.

819
01:28:24,966 --> 01:28:27,510
I was so happy that you came
all that way to see me.

820
01:28:28,386 --> 01:28:31,264
Left alone, I would've been
one giant ball of frustration.

821
01:28:32,557 --> 01:28:37,478
There have been many times I've thought
of painting over that painting.

822
01:28:38,479 --> 01:28:39,814
Why? It's so beautiful.

823
01:28:40,648 --> 01:28:41,774
When I saw you today,

824
01:28:42,191 --> 01:28:44,777
I saw your sad face
and thought, "I've found it!"

825
01:28:45,528 --> 01:28:48,281
- I knew I could paint you.
- Not fair!

826
01:28:50,491 --> 01:28:51,409
Sure it is.

827
01:28:53,369 --> 01:28:54,996
- Let's go to sleep.
- Okay.

828
01:28:57,832 --> 01:29:00,418
- Sorry about taking your bed.
- Don't worry about it.

829
01:29:04,130 --> 01:29:05,715
Can I visit you once in a while?

830
01:29:05,798 --> 01:29:08,134
Sure. Anytime during the summer.

831
01:29:08,509 --> 01:29:11,054
- And I'll try to visit you too.
- Okay.

832
01:29:16,601 --> 01:29:20,271
<i>The dirigible Freedom Adventurer,
recently damaged in a forced landing</i>

833
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:23,733
<i>due to torrential rains
just outside the city limits,</i>

834
01:29:23,816 --> 01:29:25,610
<i>has now been repaired...</i>

835
01:29:26,110 --> 01:29:28,279
Hello. Gutiokipan Bakery.

836
01:29:28,905 --> 01:29:30,239
Ah, Kiki.

837
01:29:30,907 --> 01:29:35,119
Take plenty of time and get rested up.

838
01:29:35,745 --> 01:29:38,581
<i>That elderly lady you helped has
another job for you.</i>

839
01:29:38,664 --> 01:29:40,500
<i>Should I tell her "no"?</i>

840
01:29:41,084 --> 01:29:44,670
I've told her you'd be away
for some time, but she kept insisting.

841
01:29:45,505 --> 01:29:48,591
Then stop on your way back. Bye.

842
01:30:07,902 --> 01:30:10,154
- Afternoon, ma'am.
- Well, well.

843
01:30:10,238 --> 01:30:12,240
We've been expecting you. Come in.

844
01:30:15,743 --> 01:30:18,788
<i>There are less than five minutes
to takeoff now.</i>

845
01:30:20,790 --> 01:30:23,835
- Very nice to see you again, ma'am.
- I'm glad you came.

846
01:30:24,001 --> 01:30:28,881
Excuse me for not standing, but my legs
are bothering me more than usual.

847
01:30:29,173 --> 01:30:30,049
Bertha, the package.

848
01:30:30,842 --> 01:30:31,759
Yes!

849
01:30:32,009 --> 01:30:33,678
I hope it hasn't taken off yet.

850
01:30:34,053 --> 01:30:35,096
Not yet.

851
01:30:35,263 --> 01:30:38,516
Bertha's absolutely mad
about lighter-than-air travel.

852
01:30:38,599 --> 01:30:40,434
I'm the adventuresome type.

853
01:30:42,061 --> 01:30:43,688
Turn the volume down.

854
01:30:44,772 --> 01:30:47,066
Kiki, would you open the box?

855
01:30:47,525 --> 01:30:48,359
Yes.

856
01:30:56,284 --> 01:30:57,326
What's this?

857
01:30:57,869 --> 01:31:00,538
Would you please deliver it
to a girl named Kiki?

858
01:31:00,621 --> 01:31:02,623
She was kind and a tremendous help.

859
01:31:03,207 --> 01:31:04,625
I want to say thank you.

860
01:31:05,376 --> 01:31:08,629
And would you find out
when her next birthday might be?

861
01:31:09,505 --> 01:31:11,632
Then I'll be able to bake her another one.

862
01:31:17,221 --> 01:31:18,264
Kiki.

863
01:31:21,851 --> 01:31:25,980
I will. And I'm sure Kiki will
want to know the lady's birthday,

864
01:31:26,063 --> 01:31:28,274
so she'll be able to give her a present.

865
01:31:29,025 --> 01:31:30,109
You've got a deal.

866
01:31:44,498 --> 01:31:47,418
- What happened?
- There's been a terrible catastrophe.

867
01:31:47,501 --> 01:31:50,630
<i>Oh, no! The ropes holding
the blimp are breaking!</i>

868
01:31:50,713 --> 01:31:52,798
<i>It's drifting straight toward our cameras.</i>

869
01:31:52,882 --> 01:31:55,801
<i>My God, it's going to...</i>

870
01:31:57,303 --> 01:32:01,098
Oh! They always leave me hanging
at the most exciting part!

871
01:32:01,974 --> 01:32:04,477
These winds always come in midsummer.

872
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:06,354
They'll be hitting us pretty soon.

873
01:32:10,858 --> 01:32:12,818
It'll pass by quickly. Don't worry.

874
01:32:12,902 --> 01:32:14,570
Oh, goody, it's back on.

875
01:32:18,449 --> 01:32:20,701
It's completely upside-down!

876
01:32:20,868 --> 01:32:23,579
<i>The Freedom Adventurer
has been shaken by great winds...</i>

877
01:32:24,538 --> 01:32:26,582
It's like a balloon in that position.

878
01:32:26,666 --> 01:32:30,878
<i>It has broken loose from its mooring
and drifted into an upside-down position.</i>

879
01:32:30,962 --> 01:32:34,757
<i>A desperate, last-ditch effort is
being made to tie the dirigible down</i>

880
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:36,592
<i>and keep it from drifting away.</i>

881
01:32:37,635 --> 01:32:41,055
<i>It's extremely doubtful
whether it can be done.</i>

882
01:32:41,138 --> 01:32:43,015
<i>Oh, no! It's useless!</i>

883
01:32:43,391 --> 01:32:46,310
That's my friend Tombo
holding on to that rope!

884
01:32:47,603 --> 01:32:50,731
<i>...attached to the end of the cable
as though it were a toy!</i>

885
01:32:50,815 --> 01:32:53,276
<i>There's a young boy
hanging on to the cable!</i>

886
01:32:53,359 --> 01:32:56,612
<i>He's being lifted away
along with the police car!</i>

887
01:32:56,696 --> 01:32:59,782
<i>- I don't believe what I'm seeing!</i>
- Tombo!

888
01:33:00,199 --> 01:33:03,244
- Are you sure it's your friend?
- I have to go!

889
01:33:03,327 --> 01:33:05,913
- Be careful!
- Oh, dear. What's happening?

890
01:33:30,730 --> 01:33:33,482
Hold on there, son!
Just hold your grip steady!

891
01:33:33,566 --> 01:33:35,401
Release the helium from the tail!

892
01:34:01,969 --> 01:34:06,140
<i>All citizens are requested
to remain calm. Do not panic.</i>

893
01:34:06,223 --> 01:34:09,852
<i>The helium inside the dirigible
will not explode.</i>

894
01:34:09,935 --> 01:34:11,020
Tombo.

895
01:34:11,812 --> 01:34:14,148
Any word about the boy
hanging on the rope?

896
01:34:14,231 --> 01:34:17,777
The latest report was that
the police car dropped into a pool!

897
01:34:20,321 --> 01:34:25,409
<i>The helium inside the dirigible
will not explode.</i>

898
01:34:31,874 --> 01:34:33,626
<i>Move aside! Get on the sidewalk!</i>

899
01:34:34,251 --> 01:34:35,419
<i>Don't block the street!</i>

900
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:42,134
Are you feeling all right?

901
01:34:47,890 --> 01:34:49,850
Please, sir, may I borrow your broom?

902
01:34:50,434 --> 01:34:52,895
- Huh?
- I promise I'll bring it right back.

903
01:34:53,020 --> 01:34:55,356
- Well, I suppose so.
- Thank you very much!

904
01:35:32,935 --> 01:35:33,811
Fly.

905
01:35:36,647 --> 01:35:37,773
Oh, my goodness!

906
01:36:06,051 --> 01:36:08,345
Straighten up and fly right,
or I'll burn you!

907
01:36:15,686 --> 01:36:17,271
The boy appears safe,

908
01:36:17,354 --> 01:36:20,357
but the dirigible is heading straight
for the clock tower.

909
01:36:20,441 --> 01:36:22,318
If the wind doesn't shift direction,

910
01:36:22,401 --> 01:36:25,821
the Freedom Adventurer
will surely smash into the tower!

911
01:36:27,448 --> 01:36:30,242
We gotta get up higher!
We're gonna hit the tower!

912
01:36:31,035 --> 01:36:32,161
There's not enough helium!

913
01:36:32,244 --> 01:36:34,497
Before we hit, jump onto the tower!

914
01:36:34,997 --> 01:36:36,123
Aye, aye, Captain!

915
01:36:36,207 --> 01:36:38,501
Hey there! Over here! Come on!

916
01:36:38,584 --> 01:36:41,629
- Get out of the way!
- Grab hold of this!

917
01:36:58,812 --> 01:36:59,897
That way! Hurry!

918
01:37:00,898 --> 01:37:02,233
Don't you dare!

919
01:37:16,664 --> 01:37:19,333
That sound is the helium gas leaking.

920
01:37:19,458 --> 01:37:22,628
The condition of the boy is unknown.
From where I am... Oh, no!

921
01:37:27,633 --> 01:37:30,553
Too much gas has escaped,
and it's falling!

922
01:37:41,897 --> 01:37:43,899
It is snagged on another building!

923
01:37:43,983 --> 01:37:46,819
- Hey, look! Over there!
- It's a miracle!

924
01:37:46,902 --> 01:37:48,862
The boy has managed to hold on!

925
01:37:49,613 --> 01:37:52,491
But how can anyone rescue him now?

926
01:37:52,575 --> 01:37:54,702
That boy is hanging on for dear life.

927
01:37:55,703 --> 01:37:56,704
Something just flew by!

928
01:37:57,329 --> 01:37:59,206
Is it a bird?

929
01:37:59,290 --> 01:38:01,500
No, no, it's a girl! A witch!

930
01:38:01,875 --> 01:38:04,503
<i>Yes, there is a young girl
soaring through the sky!</i>

931
01:38:05,170 --> 01:38:06,505
Wow! Go, Kiki!

932
01:38:06,797 --> 01:38:08,007
She can fly now!

933
01:38:08,674 --> 01:38:09,842
Get 'em!

934
01:38:10,217 --> 01:38:11,218
Tombo!

935
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:12,636
Kiki!

936
01:38:15,681 --> 01:38:18,601
Come on! Be a good broom and help me out!

937
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:22,271
Hang on, young fella! Don't give up!

938
01:38:22,354 --> 01:38:24,106
Hold on! She's almost there!

939
01:38:24,982 --> 01:38:26,191
Tombo!

940
01:38:27,109 --> 01:38:28,152
Kiki!

941
01:38:31,363 --> 01:38:33,699
You can do it!

942
01:38:34,199 --> 01:38:35,701
Hold on! Don't give up now!

943
01:38:35,784 --> 01:38:37,995
You can do it!

944
01:38:38,621 --> 01:38:39,663
Don't give up, son.

945
01:38:39,747 --> 01:38:43,667
Don't give up!

946
01:38:43,751 --> 01:38:48,088
Don't give up!

947
01:38:55,220 --> 01:38:58,390
She caught him in midair!
I've never seen anything so amazing!

948
01:39:16,367 --> 01:39:19,787
They've landed safely.
What a sight to see!

949
01:39:19,870 --> 01:39:21,705
Everyone onboard appears to be fine.

950
01:39:21,789 --> 01:39:24,124
That broom is mine.
I gave it to her myself.

951
01:39:24,208 --> 01:39:27,753
She did it!

952
01:39:28,462 --> 01:39:30,089
You're so brave, Kiki.

953
01:39:30,172 --> 01:39:31,882
You did a great job!

954
01:39:34,218 --> 01:39:37,221
Better call the hospital.
I'll be ready any minute now.

955
01:39:45,646 --> 01:39:46,689
Jiji!

956
01:42:28,433 --> 01:42:30,435
We just got a letter from Kiki!

957
01:42:34,439 --> 01:42:38,861
"Dear Mother and Father,
how are you doing? Jiji and I are fine."

958
01:42:39,528 --> 01:42:41,822
<i>Everything at work is falling into place.</i>

959
01:42:41,905 --> 01:42:43,282
<i>I'm gaining confidence.</i>

960
01:42:44,408 --> 01:42:46,285
<i>There are still times when I feel sad,</i>

961
01:42:46,368 --> 01:42:48,453
<i>but all in all, I sure love this town.</i>

962
01:42:55,794 --> 01:42:59,256
THE END
