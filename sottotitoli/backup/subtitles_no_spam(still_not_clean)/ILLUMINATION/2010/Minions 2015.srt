1
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:47,518
<i>Minions.</i>

2
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:51,939
<i>Minions have been on this planet
far longer than we have.</i>

3
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:56,900
<i>They go by many names.
Dave, Carl, Paul, Mike.</i>

4
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,904
<i>Oh, that one is Norbert.</i>

5
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:03,330
<i>He's an idiot.</i>

6
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:06,499
<i>They're all different, but
they all share the same goal.</i>

7
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:10,754
<i>To serve the most despicable
master they could find.</i>

8
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:11,918
Boss!

9
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:20,713
<i>Making their master happy was
the tribe's very reason for existence.</i>

10
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:24,972
<i>But that's not to say that they
didn't have other passions.</i>

11
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,447
<i>Finding a boss was easy.</i>

12
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:40,909
<i>But keeping a boss,
therein lies the rub.</i>

13
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:25,286
<i>Nope, it wasn't easy
for these guys.</i>

14
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:26,949
<i>But they never gave up.</i>

15
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,582
<i>With the emergence
of the Stone Age</i>

16
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:32,918
<i>came the rise
of a new species.</i>

17
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:35,709
<i>Man was very different
from the dinosaur.</i>

18
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,341
<i>He was shorter, hairier,</i>

19
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:40,095
<i>and way, way smarter.</i>

20
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,341
<i>The Minions took
an instant liking to man,</i>

21
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:50,310
<i>and helped him
the best they could.</i>

22
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:54,769
Oh, no, no.

23
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:11,831
<i>Poor man.
So trusting, so fragile.</i>

24
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:14,333
<i>So, so delicious!</i>

25
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,256
<i>Their quest for a boss put
the Minions front and center</i>

26
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:21,675
<i>for some of civilization's
most historic moments.</i>

27
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,838
Anubis!

28
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:30,137
<i>Ancient Egypt
held great promise.</i>

29
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:34,606
Okay! Pancake!

30
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:38,610
<i>But it didn't last long.</i>

31
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:46,659
<i>The Dark Ages were
actually fun times.</i>

32
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:50,370
<i>Their new master
had a tendency</i>

33
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:53,374
<i>to party all night
and sleep all day.</i>

34
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,719
<i>But eventually,
the party was over.</i>

35
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:19,144
<i>They bounced from
one evil boss to another,</i>

36
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:21,608
<i>but they never seemed
to find their perfect fit.</i>

37
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,984
<i>One particular employer took
their failure very, very badly.</i>

38
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:43,585
<i>The Minions had no other
choice but to keep moving.</i>

39
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,757
<i>And then,
when all hope seemed lost,</i>

40
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,595
<i>they found sanctuary.</i>

41
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,645
<i>The Minions were safe!</i>

42
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:29,679
<i>Years passed as the Minions
forged their own civilization.</i>

43
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:32,635
<i>They truly made
a life for themselves.</i>

44
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,098
<i>But something
just wasn't right.</i>

45
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:43,103
<i>They felt empty inside.</i>

46
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:45,401
<i>Without a master,
they had no purpose.</i>

47
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:48,276
<i>They became aimless
and depressed.</i>

48
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:58,082
<i>If this continued any longer,
the Minions would perish.</i>

49
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:04,962
<i>But all was not lost
for one Minion had a plan.</i>

50
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:08,083
<i>His name was Kevin.</i>

51
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:14,089
<i>He was excited to share
his idea with the tribe.</i>

52
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:18,051
<i>He'd been preparing
for days, weeks, months.</i>

53
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,724
<i>But now he was ready.</i>

54
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:34,370
Buddies!

55
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,915
<i>Kevin would leave
the cave...</i>

56
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,667
<i>...go back
to the outside world,</i>

57
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,084
<i>and he would not return
until he had found his tribe</i>

58
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,550
<i>the biggest,
baddest villain to serve.</i>

59
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,343
<i>But he needed help.</i>

60
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:56,548
Me!

61
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,679
<i>Bob was eager to go,</i>

62
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:02,013
<i>but Kevin felt he was
just not strong enough</i>

63
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:03,980
<i>for the dangerous
journey ahead.</i>

64
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:06,060
Uh, no.

65
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,236
<i>Luckily, someone stepped up.</i>

66
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,407
Stuart!

67
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,787
Huh? Me, me?
Oh! Thank you.

68
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,875
<i>Truth be told, Stuart had
no idea what he was chosen for...</i>

69
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:28,588
<i>...but was thrilled it made
people cheer for him.</i>

70
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:30,294
Thank you.

71
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,801
Me!

72
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,726
Eh, okay.

73
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,032
<i>Eventually,
Bob's energy and enthusiasm,</i>

74
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:01,869
<i>but mostly lack of other volunteers,
changed Kevin's mind.</i>

75
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,671
<i>The tribe said
their farewells.</i>

76
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:14,174
<i>Kevin had given them something
they hadn't had in a very long time.</i>

77
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,542
<i>Hope.</i>

78
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:17,763
Bob!

79
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,890
Hey, Tony!

80
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,602
Tom...

81
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,557
Chris...

82
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:25,976
Hey, Bob.

83
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,232
Bye-bye.

84
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,285
<i>Kevin felt pride.</i>

85
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:43,946
<i>He was going to be
the one to save his tribe.</i>

86
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,960
<i>Stuart felt hungry mostly.</i>

87
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:50,667
<i>He was going to be the one
to eat this banana.</i>

88
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,091
<i>And Bob...</i>

89
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:58,341
<i>Bob was frightened
of the journey ahead.</i>

90
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:01,721
Ah. Okay.

91
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:12,183
Okay. Okay.

92
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,032
<i>And they were off.</i>

93
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:20,367
<i>Off to find their new boss!</i>

94
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,217
Huh? Kevin!

95
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:10,002
Huh? Banana!

96
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:13,787
Uh, Stuart?

97
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,132
Banana. Banana!

98
00:11:19,283 --> 00:11:20,549
Stuart!

99
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,014
Stopa!

100
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:25,846
Uh, Bob! Stopa!

101
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,259
Bob!

102
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,386
- Uh, no, no.
- No, no. No, no, no.

103
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,048
Profiterole.

104
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:07,680
No, no, no!

105
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,807
Stuart...

106
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:20,733
Oh, look at that one!

107
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:26,160
- Peace!
- Make love, not war!

108
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,360
Peace and love!

109

00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:25,125
Orlando!

183
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:47,118
Hey, Stuart...

184
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:50,526
Oh, yeah! Far out!

185
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,820
Love is the way, brother!

186
00:17:58,411 --> 00:17:59,786
Eh, no, no, no,
no, no, Kevin.

187
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,175
Hey! Stopa! Stopa! Stopa!

188
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:33,194
Stopa! Ugh!

189
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:56,957
Stuart...

190
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:28,160
Oh, Walter, look!

191
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,168
These adorable little freaks
are headed to Orlando, too!

192
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,827
Yeah, I see that!
Hey, Walter Junior!

193
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:35,002
What's happenin'?

194
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:36,170
- Tina.
- Hi!

195
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:37,223
Binky.

196
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,134
What do you say we give
these fellows a ride?

197
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,177
Yay! New friends!

198
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,505
All aboard
the Nelson Express!

199
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,304
You, one-eye!
You're sitting next to me!

200
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:47,846
Okay.

201
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:49,680
Stuart!

202
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:58,439
Glad we came along before
some weirdos picked you up!

203
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:01,200
Who wants apple slices?

204
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:05,866
Oh, you, too!

205
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:10,083
Growing boy-like creatures
need their strength.

206
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,705
Okay.

207
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:13,958
Heck, yeah!

208
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:16,794
Thanks, man!

209
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:20,249
All righty! Who needs
to stretch their legs?

210
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,755
- Yeah!
- Yes! Me, me, me!

211
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:24,218
- Sweet!
- You guys wait here, we'll be right back.

212
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,513
Okay, Nelsons,
let's do this!

213
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:37,686
Go, go, go!

214
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,698
Okey-dokey.
On the road again.

215
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,041
Dad! We got company!

216
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:56,211
It's because I tripped
the alarm. I stink!

217
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:59,831
Hey, we all make mistakes, sugarplum.
You're still learning.

218
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,625
Huh! What?

219
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,962
- Your father's right, Tina.
- Reload!

220
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,929
He wasn't this good
at being evil overnight!

221
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:08,759
- Reload!
- Your time's coming.

222
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:12,305
It's jammed!

223
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:49,219
Okay, who did that?

224
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,846
Uh... Stuart!

225
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,388
That was great!

226
00:21:54,084 --> 00:21:55,104
Thank you!

227
00:21:56,982 --> 00:22:00,398
Say, fellas, can we get
personal for just a second?

228
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:03,522
Why are you going
to Orlando?

229
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:08,575
Come on. You can tell us. You're
going to Villain-Con, aren't you?

230
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,369
Villain-Con.

231
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,157
Villain-Con.

232
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:15,830
Wow! So many bad guys
in the car. What fun!

233
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:18,954
I knew it! I knew you were
villains! Didn't I, honey?

234
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:21,833
What a small world!
Hope we're not in rival gangs.

235
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,417
Binky! Joke!
Babies, huh?

236
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:00,328
Big boss!

237
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:28,776
When we get to Orlando,

238
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:31,535
I'm gonna get all my favorite
villains to sign my magazine!

239
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:34,156
Dumo the Sumo!

240
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:35,871
Boss!

241
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:39,871
Oh, Kevin, you don't wanna work
for him! He ate his last henchmen!

242
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:43,085
Frankie Fish Lips.

243
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:44,500
He lives in the ocean.

244
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:46,381
Boss?

245
00:23:46,634 --> 00:23:48,009
Can you breathe
underwater?

246
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,504
Uh, so-so.

247
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:53,723
Look at her!
Scarlet Overkill!

248
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:56,477
The coolest super-villain,
like, ever!

249
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:00,059
She started out as your average
little girl, braces, pigtails.

250
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:04,524
But by the time she was 13,
she built a criminal empire!

251
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:08,352
If I was a Minion, that's
who I'd want to work for!

252
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:13,232
Here we are!
Beautiful Orlando!

253
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:14,786
Yeah! We're here!

254
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:20,742
Orlando!

255
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,591
Hey, gang, watch this!

256
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:38,933
<i>Welcome to Billy Bob's Bait Shop.
How can I help you?</i>

257
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,646
Yeah, hi.

258
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:44,391
We're here for, uh,
so much fun, it's a crime.

259
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,666
Villain-Con!

260
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,464
All right!
Here we go!

261
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:19,640
Well, this is it! I wanna tell you,
and I really mean this.

262
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:21,055
I really appreciate
what you did

263
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:22,888
back there with
the cops, really!

264
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,103
Dad!
It's Frankie Fish Lips!

265
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,230
I can smell him
from here!

266
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:28,646
Junior!
Get my camera!

267
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:30,775
Good luck in there,
boys!

268
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:33,104
I hope you find what
you're looking for!

269
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,230
Bye!

270
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,161
Villain-Con!

271
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:39,360
Yeah!

272
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:40,862
Villain-Con!

273
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,076
Okay!

274
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,959
Any evil talents?

275
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,252
Not bad.

276
00:25:56,764 --> 00:25:59,005
What about you?
Any evil talents?

277
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:03,305
Bello! La, la, la!
La, la, la!

278
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:06,853
That's not evil
or a talent.

279
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:15,312
Bello!

280
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:19,567
No?

281
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:23,369
I'm sorry! But I'm not
looking for any more servants,

282
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:26,790
for I, Professor Flux,
have invented

283
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:29,546
the world's
first time machine!

284
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:35,549
Every time I visit the future,
I bring my future self back to help me.

285
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:36,834
Hello!

286
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:41,929
Move that over there, Professor
Flux from two weeks from now.

287
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:44,971
As you can see,
I don't need any help.

288
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:51,692
Oh, way to go, guys.
We killed the original!

289
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,395
Please!

290
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:02,444
<i>Villain-Con presents
our keynote speaker,</i>

291
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:05,242
<i>Scarlet Overkill!</i>

292

294
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:14,664
Buddies!

295
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:15,921
Scarlet?

296
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:17,338
Kevin!

297
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:20,758
<i>Are you ready...</i>

298
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:23,723

<i>...for Scarlet Overkill!</i>

300
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:34,476
Doesn't it feel
so good to be bad?

301
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,028
- Scarlet! Scarlet! Scarlet!
- Yes!

302
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:00,303
Awesome!

303
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:02,294
Yeah!

304
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:07,310
Wow! Thank you!

305
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:09,303
Scarlet! Scarlet!

306
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:11,685
Thank you so much!

307
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,812
Okay.

308
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:19,822
When I started out,
people said a woman

309
00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:22,861
could never rob
a bank as well as a man!

310
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:27,368
Well... times change!

311
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:29,911
I love you, Scarlet!

312
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,752
Look at all those
faces out there!

313
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:34,995
We are all so different!

314
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:36,915
But we have one
thing in common.

315
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:40,253
We were
born with flippers!

316
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:45,178
No? Just me? Okay.

317
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,767
We have big dreams!

318
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:51,426
And we will do anything
to make them come true!

319
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:54,523
Have any of you
ever dreamt

320
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:58,819
of working for the greatest
super-villain of all time?

321
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:00,436
Yeah!

322
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:06,201
Well, what if
I were to tell you

323
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:09,869
that I am looking
for new henchmen?

324
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:12,163
Hey, boss! Boss!

325
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:16,538
I truly believe
somewhere out there

326
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:20,628
is a villain with the
potential to serve greatness!

327
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:23,422
And it could be
any of you.

328
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,839
Although,
let's not kid ourselves.

329
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:31,558
Truly, the only men for this
job are Kevin and his Minions!

330
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:33,684
- Huh? But... But...
- Ten times the evil

331
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:36,939
in half the package!
I am just in awe!

332
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,934
Let's hear it for Kevin.

333
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:41,697
He saved his tribe!

334
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,986
Kevin! Kevin! Kevin!

335
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:48,365
- Kevin! Kevin! Kevin...
- Hey! Kevin. Hey. Hey!

336
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,374
So, how
should we do this?

337
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:59,584
You see this
tiny little trinket?

338
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:02,249
Well, just take it from my
hand and you've got the job.

339
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:04,880
No big deal,
it's almost too simple.

340
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:07,799
Oh, come on!
Don't be afraid.

341
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:11,223
Just take the stone and
get that job! Come on!

342
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:12,389
Oh, okay.

343
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,097
Boss!

344
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:15,432
That job is mine!

345
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:24,859
Now go easy on me.

346
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:31,195
Love the costume!

347
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:36,864
So cool!

348
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:42,621
Tim? Tim!

349
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,879
Oh, no, Bob!

350
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:51,214
Ah! Tim! Tim!

351
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:53,051
Is no one good enough?

352
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,261
Bob!

353
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:07,943
I got it!
I got it!

354
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:20,371
Didn't my speech
inspire anyone

355
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:23,214
to rise up and
prove themselves worthy?

356
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,589
All these villains and
yet I still have the bear.

357
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:29,966
Stuffed bear!
Why am I holding a bear?

358
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:31,929
Who has the ruby?

359
00:31:39,356 --> 00:31:40,933
Wow! Who...

360
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:45,816
Who are you, my knights
in shining denim?

361
00:31:47,051 --> 00:31:48,656
Stuart.

362
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,151
- Bob.
- Minions!

363
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:52,614
That was incredible!

364
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:55,407
Behold! The last
creatures you'd expect

365
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:58,166
to win the day have
emerged victorious!

366
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:03,585
Everyone, meet my new
henchmen. The Minions!

367
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:07,041
- Kumbaya!
- Kumbaya! Kumbaya!

368
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,218
Kumbaya!

369
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:14,431
Hey! I know those guys!
I gave them a ride here!

370
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:22,811
Buckle up, boys!
Next stop, England.

371
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:21,989
Bello?

372
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:24,325
Hey, Kevin! Eh?

373
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:26,620
Boss? In England?

374
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:27,828
Nah, Boss!

375
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:42,976
Ah, uh... Bello, Kevin?

376
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:44,308
England?

377
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,189
Boss?

378
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:48,084
Scarlet Popapil.

379
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:01,405
Bello? Bello!
Bello?

380
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:24,265
Here we go! There.

381
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:27,773
By the way,
I really like your bear.

382
00:34:28,275 --> 00:34:30,018
Herb! My baby!

383
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,652
You know I am!

384
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:33,226
How'd it go?

385
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:34,732
Were you evil?

386
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:36,445
So evil!

387
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:39,405
A little bird
dropped this off today.

388
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:45,542
It's me,
I'm the "H".

389
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:48,543
Also, there was no bird.
Also me.

390
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:52,377
Herb, seriously, I wanna dig
up that William Shakespeare

391
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:54,791
so he can see
what true writing is.

392
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:56,047
I love it!

393
00:34:56,136 --> 00:34:58,971
Ah, that works out
because I love...

394
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:01,973
Well, I love... too.

395
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:03,850
Ah, the love, ah!

396
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:09,731
Oh, boys, could you
come here, please?

397
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:15,771
Meet my husband, Herb.
Inventor, super genius, fox.

398
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:19,108
Herb, these are
the new recruits.

399
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,486
Kevin, Stuart, and that
cute little one is Bob.

400
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:23,824
Hey, bello!

401
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:27,697
Right on! You guys are
crazy little and way yellow,

402
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,200
and I dig that!

403
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:34,830
Sweet, man!

404
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,717
I know, right?

405
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:46,809
Just a few things I stole
to help fill the void.

406
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:49,928
Mega ukulele!

407
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:54,603
Checkin' out my can?

408
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:56,438
We stole that
because finally someone

409
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:58,855
expressed my love of
soup in painting form.

410
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:04,032
Okay, listen up! It is time
to get down to business.

411
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:06,576
Do you know
who this is?

412
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:12,577
This is Queen Elizabeth,
ruler of England.

413
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:17,750
Oh, I love England.
The music, the fashion.

414
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:20,250
I'm seriously thinking about
overthrowing it someday.

415
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:26,262
Anyway, this pale drink
of water oversees it all.

416
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:29,305
I'm her biggest fan,
love her work!

417
00:36:29,396 --> 00:36:32,313
And I really, really,
really want her crown.

418
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:39,485
Steal me the crown
and all your dreams come true.

419
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:41,945
Respect! Power!

420
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,231
Banana!

421
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,452
Banana!

422
00:36:56,506 --> 00:36:58,336
Henry!

423
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:02,594
England...

424
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,465
England...

425
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:41,417
No! Oh, no.

426
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:42,885
Don't get too close,
boys.

427
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:44,796
When it's completed,
it'll be my ultimate weapon.

428
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:49,300
But right now, it's leaking radiation
like you would not believe!

429
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:54,105
So, you're here for gear.

430
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:00,560
Bob, Robert,
Bobby, my boy.

431
00:38:01,175 --> 00:38:05,031
You get my
far-out stretch suit.

432
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,693
Kevin, Kevbo,
Seventh Kevin,

433
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:13,873
you are the proud owner
of my lava lamp gun.

434
00:38:14,688 --> 00:38:17,244
This baby shoots
actual lava!

435
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:20,749
Pretty cool, right?

436
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:25,586
And finally, Stu.
Stuart, Stuperman, Beef Stu.

437
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:28,549
I got you the coolest
invention, probably ever.

438
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:32,223
Hypno-hat!

439
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:42,315
You can use it to
hypnotize anyone. Anyone!

440
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:45,322
Oh, you look so great!

441
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:47,280
I feel like a proud mama
with three

442
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:49,359
dashing evil sons.

443
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:52,572
Uh, Scarlet, Scarlet...

444
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:55,415
No, no. Don't say anything.
I won't understand.

445
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:59,414
It's getting late. You've had
a big day, you must be exhausted!

446
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:05,916
Wow! These cats
are pumped!

447
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:10,138
Well, maybe I'll settle them
down with a bedtime story?

448
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:18,685
How does that sound, Bob?
Bob. Bob! Bob!

449
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:20,564
Oh! Bedtime porry?

450
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:23,900
That is a groovy idea! I'll go
get some cookies and warm milk.

451
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:26,904
This is gonna be so fun!

452
00:39:27,991 --> 00:39:29,271
Bedtime porry.

453
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:33,780
Oh, yes, I've got a really,
really good bedtime porry.

454
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:38,701
<i>Once upon a time,
there were three little pigs.</i>

455
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:44,914
<i>One fateful day, the pigs
encountered a big, bad wolf</i>

456
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:49,387
<i>who had a wonderful
surprise for them!</i>

457
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:52,590
<i>The wolf offered the three
piggies and all their friends</i>

458
00:39:52,682 --> 00:39:54,509
<i>a job working for her.</i>

459
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:57,352
<i>Everyone would be so happy!</i>

460
00:39:58,187 --> 00:39:59,730
<i>All the three
little piggies had to do</i>

461
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:01,723
<i>was just steal
one little crown</i>

462
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:03,476
<i>that the beautiful wolf
had wanted</i>

463
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:07,518
<i>ever since she was
a penniless little street cub,</i>

464
00:40:07,614 --> 00:40:10,650
<i>unloved and abandoned.</i>

465
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:14,825
<i>But that crown would mean
she was a princess,</i>

466
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:17,071
<i>and everybody
loves a princess!</i>

467
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:19,620
<i>So the wolf sent the piggies
to get that crown.</i>

468
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:24,078
<i>But the little pigs
weren't up to the challenge.</i>

469
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:25,999
<i>They failed their mission.</i>

470
00:40:26,716 --> 00:40:32,137
<i>So the wolf huffed and puffed, and
she blew them off the face of the earth!</i>

471
00:40:39,062 --> 00:40:40,260
The end.

472
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:47,650
Good luck getting that crown
tomorrow, little piggies.

473
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:51,105
I know you
won't disappoint me.

474
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:08,211
Okay.

475
00:41:09,342 --> 00:41:11,086
Scarlet.

476
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:12,837
Which way is the loo,
please?

477
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:14,008
Oh, thank you.

478
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:17,933
Bello.

479
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:19,761
Uh... please.

480
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:24,146
You're not allowed in without
an adult. Scram, hooligans!

481
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:36,069
Oh, la...

482
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:37,656
Stuart.

483
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,911
How many tickets,
please?

484
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:46,493
Three please.

485
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,166
One please.

486
00:41:56,014 --> 00:41:57,508
Enjoy yourself, love.

487
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:58,974
Thank you!

488
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:04,516
It was nowhere
near Hyde Park!

489
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:05,850
Bob's your uncle.

490
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:09,566
Okay.

491
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:17,700
Okay.

492
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:24,613
Okay.

493
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:25,823
Hey!

494
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:27,710
What are you doing here?

495
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:33,046
This is a restricted area!
Hands in the air!

496
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:34,758
No...

497
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:41,636
Stop that!

498
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:46,603
Get back.

499
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:23,758
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey!

500
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:25,595
Bob, Stuart...

501
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:05,053
So...

502
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:09,306
So, you came for
the Queen's crown, did you?

503
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:12,517
Well, you're gonna
have to get through me!

504
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:15,182
The Keeper of the Crown!

505
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:24,112
You think it's funny to
mock the elderly, do you?

506
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:28,579
I've been up here
for decades,

507
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,706
just waiting
for someone to try

508
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:32,750
and steal
the Queen's treasure!

509
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:35,958
Okay.

510
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:40,132
What are you saying?
Never mind, don't care!

511
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:46,260
Oh, no!

512
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,806
Oh, no, you don't!

513
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:51,932
Oh, flippin' heck!

514
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:55,688
What's goin' on?

515
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:02,689
Bob...

516
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:35,018
Hello!

517
00:45:55,378 --> 00:45:56,492
Hello!

518
00:45:57,088 --> 00:45:58,119
Stone the crows!

519
00:45:58,214 --> 00:45:59,328
Stop him, lads!
Wait!

520
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:00,580
Go for the legs!

521
00:46:05,972 --> 00:46:07,134
Gordon Bennett!

522
00:46:07,223 --> 00:46:08,682
Kevin!

523
00:46:14,647 --> 00:46:16,556
The Queen's
been kidnapped, Sarge!

524
00:46:16,649 --> 00:46:17,680
Blimey!

525
00:46:42,091 --> 00:46:44,297
- What's going on?
- Bello!

526
00:46:44,385 --> 00:46:45,464
Oh, my goodness!

527
00:46:48,097 --> 00:46:49,128
No!

528
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:55,221
Gentlemen do not
steal ladies' crowns!

529
00:47:12,413 --> 00:47:13,824
Oh, no, no,
no, no, no!

530
00:47:18,753 --> 00:47:19,832
Oh, dear!

531
00:47:32,725 --> 00:47:34,005
Yeah!

532
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:36,509
You scoundrel!
After them!

533
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:41,973
Stop the blighter!

534
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:45,818
Go on, grab him!

535
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:03,421
Cor, blimey!

536
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:07,633
<i>One of England's most famous
myths has become a reality</i>

537
00:48:08,511 --> 00:48:10,717
<i>as a new king
has been crowned.</i>

538
00:48:10,805 --> 00:48:14,008
<i>Bob, who appears to be
a bald, jaundiced child,</i>

539
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:16,472
<i>has pulled the famed sword
right from its stone,</i>

540
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,265
<i>which, legend dictates,
makes him the new king.</i>

541
00:48:19,668 --> 00:48:22,356
Tiny yellow traitor!

542
00:48:37,248 --> 00:48:38,281
England!

543
00:48:38,374 --> 00:48:40,283
England! England!

544
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:42,706
England!
England! England!

545
00:48:42,795 --> 00:48:45,630
England! England...

546
00:49:12,825 --> 00:49:14,200
Bello!

547
00:49:14,535 --> 00:49:15,566
Bello!

548
00:49:15,703 --> 00:49:16,782
Cut!

549
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:29,061
Hey, Bob.

550
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,426
Hello, King Bob.

551
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:42,056
Welcome to
Buckingham Palace.

552
00:49:42,146 --> 00:49:43,260
Uh, no.

553
00:49:43,898 --> 00:49:46,104
Oh, what's the matter,
Your Majesty?

554
00:49:46,192 --> 00:49:48,268
Whatever's bothering you,
we can make it right.

555
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,523
Just name it!

556
00:49:52,615 --> 00:49:53,690
Buddies!

557
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:56,857
Buddies! Buddies!

558
00:49:58,204 --> 00:50:00,196
Buddies!

559
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:20,010
King Bob!

560
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:22,842
Long live the king!

561
00:50:22,937 --> 00:50:24,846
King Bob!

562
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:31,110
Bob... King...

563
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:46,451
So...

564
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:02,048
King Bob!

565
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:14,981
King Bob! Wait!

566
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:27,663
King Bob!

567
00:51:45,686 --> 00:51:47,272
Yes, King Bob.

568
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,019
King Bob?

569
00:51:51,734 --> 00:51:52,896
King Bob?

570
00:51:53,027 --> 00:51:54,307
Ah, Claire.

571
00:51:54,403 --> 00:51:55,778
Mmm, Tiffany.

572
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:06,497
Ball!

573
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:09,247
How dare you!

574
00:52:16,175 --> 00:52:17,337
Scarlet!

575
00:52:17,426 --> 00:52:21,174
Don't you "Scarlet" me, you
backstabbing little traitors!

576
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:24,050
Using Herb's invention
to steal my crown?

577
00:52:26,352 --> 00:52:28,640
I feel used.
Not gonna lie.

578
00:52:28,729 --> 00:52:34,483
You stole my dream! I was going
to conquer England someday!

579
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:36,477
There was gonna
be a coronation,

580
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:39,061
and I was going
to be made Queen.

581
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:40,983
Every moment was planned.

582
00:52:41,075 --> 00:52:44,444
I'd wear a dress so sparkly,
it glowed!

583
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:48,783
And everyone who ever
doubted me would be watching,

584
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:51,709
and they would be crying!

585
00:52:51,794 --> 00:52:55,412
I was going to be the picture
of elegance and class!

586
00:52:55,506 --> 00:52:58,210
And you pinheads
screwed it up!

587
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,127
No, no, no!

588
00:53:02,054 --> 00:53:05,672
No, no, no, King Bob! You cannot
just abdicate the throne!

589
00:53:05,766 --> 00:53:07,426
Who invited the square?

590
00:53:07,518 --> 00:53:11,183
And you definitely cannot just
give the job to this woman!

591
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:12,647
There are laws!

592
00:53:12,815 --> 00:53:14,807
Boss... Boss.

593
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:21,438
Scarlet Popapil!

594
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:24,070
<i>King Bob has
officially changed the law,</i>

595
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:25,867
<i>clearing the way
for Scarlet Overkill</i>

596
00:53:25,953 --> 00:53:27,826
<i>to be crowned
Queen of England!</i>

597
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:31,247
<i>She will be coronated at
London's historic Westminster Abbey.</i>

598
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:35,201
<i>If I wasn't so polite, I'd say this
spells certain doom for the country,</i>

599
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:36,790
<i>if not the world.</i>

600
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,454
<i>But I'm so very polite that
I shall keep my mouth shut.</i>

601
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:42,959
<i>But, seriously,
we're all in big trouble.</i>

602
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:44,762
Scarlet! Scarlet!

603
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:48,220
I don't have time
to answer any questions.

604
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:49,968
I just want to
thank the Minions

605
00:53:50,102 --> 00:53:53,305
for going above and
beyond the call of duty.

606
00:53:53,397 --> 00:53:56,398
You are three tiny, golden

607
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:58,939
pill-shaped
miracle workers,

608
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:03,524
and you have stolen
not just England but my heart.

609
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:05,074
Scarlet, over here!

610
00:54:07,578 --> 00:54:08,906
Pardon me?

611
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:15,918
Wow! So many!
Good for you!

612
00:54:16,003 --> 00:54:17,912
Well, you'll all
get what you deserve.

613
00:54:19,131 --> 00:54:20,874
Serve... serve!

614
00:54:51,038 --> 00:54:52,746
Go ahead, go ahead.

615
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:06,545
I don't want you to take this
the wrong way, but I hate you.

616
00:55:07,054 --> 00:55:11,431
I thought I could get over what
you did, but I feel so betrayed.

617
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:16,473
I think... Yes, I think we're
gonna have to break up.

618
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:19,019
And it's not you.

619
00:55:19,107 --> 00:55:22,726
Wait, hold on.
It is you. It's 100% you!

620
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:24,195
No, no.

621
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:28,657
So get comfortable, Minions.
Get real, real comfortable.

622
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:31,150
Because this is where
you're going to spend

623
00:55:31,245 --> 00:55:35,242
the rest of your
worthless little lives.

624
00:55:37,918 --> 00:55:40,753
All right!
Let's do this!

625
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:42,539
Herb!

626
00:55:42,631 --> 00:55:44,754
Who's this
handsome "Herb" fella?

627
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:48,507
No, my name is "Blerb".
I'm a dungeon master.

628
00:55:49,221 --> 00:55:51,546
Prepare for torture,
which I do!

629
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:57,721
All right, are we comfy?
Doesn't matter! This is torture!

630
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:07,612
Wow! Harder than I thought.
Next machine!

631
00:56:07,823 --> 00:56:12,568
Oh, welcome to Hang Town!
Population, you!

632
00:56:19,668 --> 00:56:22,124
Cut it out! This is
really unprofessional!

633
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:24,039
There's no laughing
in the dungeon!

634
00:56:24,131 --> 00:56:26,669
I wanna see tears and
I wanna hear screams,

635
00:56:26,758 --> 00:56:28,917
or I'm gonna get... Wait!

636
00:56:29,011 --> 00:56:31,003
- Hey!
- Ooh! I've got a groovy idea!

637
00:56:34,308 --> 00:56:36,101
Look at this!

638
00:56:42,691 --> 00:56:45,645
<i>Hello! Will the future
king, Herb Overkill,</i>

639
00:56:45,736 --> 00:56:48,143
<i>please come upstairs
to prepare for the coronation?</i>

640
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:50,527
Well, I hope you learned
your lesson for today.

641
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:56,737
And by the way, it was me,
Herb, the whole time!

642
00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:01,418
I don't even know
anyone named "Blerb"!

643
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:03,293
Uh, Herb...

644
00:57:05,464 --> 00:57:10,589
I am hours away from becoming
the Queen of England!

645
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:12,551
I know!
It's a gas!

646
00:57:12,638 --> 00:57:14,547
- I will finally get my crown.
- Yeah.

647
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:18,055
It's all I've ever wanted.
I'm going to be so happy.

648
00:57:19,353 --> 00:57:22,472
But let me ask you
something, Fabrice.

649
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:25,518
Does that look
like this to you?

650
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:33,568
Mrs. Overkill, the hair in that
picture, it's just two wavy lines!

651
00:57:34,368 --> 00:57:36,407
Oh, so, what,
now you're an art critic?

652
00:57:36,495 --> 00:57:40,872
I drew that when I was five years old!
Get out of my sight!

653
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:46,128
Bye, Fabrice!

654
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:48,753
I liked him.
He was fun.

655
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:51,381
So, what do you
think of the dress?

656
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:57,055
Oh, it's so beautiful. So
fashion-forward. So Valentino.

657
00:57:57,766 --> 00:58:00,304
Gave it a sweetheart neckline
because you're my sweetheart.

658
00:58:00,394 --> 00:58:02,102
The high collar
and cinched waist

659
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:04,476
reflect a simpler,
more violent time.

660
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:08,099
The material is a blend of taffeta
and high-density body armor.

661
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:09,652
Fully armed and loaded.

662
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:13,477
And that glow,
that's nuclear.

663
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:15,613
Nice. Just one more
thing to do.

664
00:58:15,701 --> 00:58:17,693
Gotta look good
for the public.

665
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:20,194
Do you mind?

666
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:21,368
My pleasure.

667
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:25,746
Little tighter, sweetie.
Come on, I can take it.

668
00:58:26,253 --> 00:58:28,376
Little tighter.

669
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:30,420
Tighter!

670
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:33,212
Must have tiny waist.

671
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:35,469
Seeing stars, seeing stars!

672
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:39,420
Losing feeling in my legs. Perfect!
Tie it, tie it, tie it, tie it.

673
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:46,978
Ah. Bob! Stuart!

674
00:58:58,160 --> 00:58:59,406
Bello!

675
00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:24,387
Eh, eh, Kevin... Scarlet.

676
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:33,392
Porry Scarlet.

677
00:59:36,323 --> 00:59:37,736
Boss.

678
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:43,406
Ah, okay!

679
01:00:03,767 --> 01:00:05,427
I love you, Scarlet!

680
01:00:05,977 --> 01:00:09,346
Queen wave, queen wave!
Queen waving!

681
01:00:18,406 --> 01:00:21,360
I am so, so excited!
This is perfect!

682
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:23,444
Everyone looks so nice!

683
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:27,071
Oh, you are just adorable!

684
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:29,906
Oh, yes!

685
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:31,544
And that music, oh!

686
01:00:32,504 --> 01:00:36,917
Who is that organist? She is good!
Right? She looks like an Edna.

687
01:00:37,008 --> 01:00:40,673
- Edna, you are very good!
- Who was that?

688
01:00:43,515 --> 01:00:46,718
Thanks for doing this,
padre. Big fan.

689
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:50,475
Come here, let me squeeze
you! Oh, you are so squishy!

690
01:00:54,109 --> 01:00:55,145
Scarlet.

691
01:00:55,235 --> 01:00:57,311
Go, go, go!

692
01:01:18,133 --> 01:01:20,540
Ciao...

693
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:33,439
Bob...

694
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:34,804
Stuart!

695
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:49,745
Okay!

696
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:56,543
<i>Will you to your power</i>

697
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:58,706
<i>cause law and justice...</i>

698
01:01:58,798 --> 01:02:00,209
Popapil!

699
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:13,394
Stopa!

700
01:02:19,986 --> 01:02:21,694
<i>In mercy...</i>

701
01:02:24,491 --> 01:02:25,819
No, no, no!

702
01:02:27,118 --> 01:02:29,656
<i>Do you, Scarlet Overkill...</i>

703
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:40,249
Yeah!

704
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:43,046
No!

705
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:08,573
<i>I proclaim thee,
Scarlet Overkill,</i>

706
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:10,818
<i>the Queen of England!</i>

707
01:03:14,416 --> 01:03:15,447
Kevin!

708
01:03:22,841 --> 01:03:25,510
Scarlet!
Scarlet, my queen?

709
01:03:25,593 --> 01:03:27,337
Somebody help me!

710
01:03:29,431 --> 01:03:33,642
Come on, come on!
Lift on two. One, two!

711
01:03:34,185 --> 01:03:35,728
One, two!

712
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:48,781
Scarlet! You're okay!

713
01:03:49,325 --> 01:03:51,484
He tried to kill me!

714
01:03:51,578 --> 01:03:53,369
Uh, no...

715
01:03:53,455 --> 01:03:59,160
Villains, this is no longer a
coronation! It is an execution!

716
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:00,794
Get them!

717
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:08,301
Whoa, Nelly!
Run, fellas, run!

718
01:04:13,892 --> 01:04:15,719
Come back here, you!

719
01:04:53,681 --> 01:04:54,796
You're mine!

720
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:55,776
Stuart, Bob!

721
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:16,614
Hey! I got one!

722
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:38,048
Tim!

723
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:51,603
Tim!

724
01:05:57,036 --> 01:05:58,495
Stuart! Bob!

725
01:06:01,332 --> 01:06:02,661
Buddies!

726
01:06:06,087 --> 01:06:07,665
<i>Mind the gap.</i>

727
01:06:09,674 --> 01:06:11,085
<i>Mind the gap.</i>

728
01:06:15,346 --> 01:06:16,889
<i>Mind the gap.</i>

729
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:18,253
Mind the gap!

730
01:06:19,934 --> 01:06:21,179
He won't get away!

731
01:06:21,269 --> 01:06:22,432
He won't escape us!

732
01:06:29,944 --> 01:06:30,976
What about this one?

733
01:06:31,779 --> 01:06:34,449
Why did the queen
go to the dentist?

734
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:37,114
To get her teeth crowned.

735
01:06:39,537 --> 01:06:41,696
Tell us another one, Lizzy!

736
01:06:42,957 --> 01:06:44,003
Bello!

737
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:45,705
It's you.

738
01:06:45,793 --> 01:06:48,498
Everyone, this is one
of the little fellows

739
01:06:48,588 --> 01:06:51,209
who stole
the monarchy from me.

740
01:06:51,299 --> 01:06:53,707
And how's that
working out for you?

741
01:06:53,801 --> 01:06:55,924
Uh, Scarlet...

742
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:58,799
Oh, yes, yes, I saw what
was going on on the telly.

743
01:06:58,890 --> 01:07:00,005
Uh, telly?

744
01:07:00,099 --> 01:07:01,843
<i>What was meant to
be the coronation of</i>

745
01:07:01,935 --> 01:07:04,805
<i>Scarlet Overkill has
gone terribly wrong as...</i>

746
01:07:04,896 --> 01:07:06,011
Move!

747
01:07:07,649 --> 01:07:11,183
Kevin, Kevin,
I know you're out there.

748
01:07:11,277 --> 01:07:15,275
You think you've gotten away?
Well, what do we have here?

749
01:07:15,365 --> 01:07:16,444
Bello!

750
01:07:16,532 --> 01:07:18,240
- Oh, my goodness!
- Bob? Stuart?

751
01:07:18,326 --> 01:07:20,734
Which one shall I kill first?

752
01:07:20,828 --> 01:07:23,580
Little Bob? Stuart?

753
01:07:23,665 --> 01:07:26,238
Bob! Stuart!

754
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:31,170
I will do it, Kevin, if you
are not back here by dawn!

755
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:32,912
Oh, my!

756
01:07:33,007 --> 01:07:34,122
No!

757
01:07:34,259 --> 01:07:35,883
Buddies!

758
01:07:35,969 --> 01:07:37,214
Scarlet.

759
01:07:53,569 --> 01:07:55,194
There he is!

760
01:08:03,955 --> 01:08:05,117
Follow me!

761
01:08:11,379 --> 01:08:13,336
Who the man, eh?

762
01:08:18,052 --> 01:08:20,259
Harder! It's just my head.

763
01:08:21,723 --> 01:08:23,347
Oh, no!

764
01:08:23,433 --> 01:08:24,808
This way! Let's get him!

765
01:08:24,892 --> 01:08:26,221
Go, go, go!

766
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:30,522
No!

767
01:08:54,422 --> 01:08:56,747
<i>Ultimate weapon initiated.</i>

768
01:08:56,841 --> 01:09:01,170
<i>Activation in three, two, one.</i>

769
01:09:30,458 --> 01:09:31,917
Bello.

770
01:09:37,382 --> 01:09:38,415
Buddies!

771
01:09:41,302 --> 01:09:43,211
This is it, boys!

772
01:09:43,304 --> 01:09:45,629
Things do not
look good for you.

773
01:09:45,723 --> 01:09:47,265
Oh, and I'm keeping
the bear.

774
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:48,809
Tim!

775
01:09:48,893 --> 01:09:51,301
You're not gonna need him
where you're going.

776
01:09:51,396 --> 01:09:52,641
Heaven.

777
01:10:08,079 --> 01:10:10,748
Bye-bye. Say bye-bye,
Bob. Bye-bye!

778
01:10:50,746 --> 01:10:52,739
Wait, what?
How did he...

779
01:10:53,458 --> 01:10:54,908
Hold my bear.

780
01:11:20,401 --> 01:11:21,435
Kevin!

781
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:25,822
So, that's your plan?

782
01:11:25,907 --> 01:11:28,148
Make yourself a bigger target?

783
01:11:35,666 --> 01:11:37,659
Kevin? Hey!

784
01:11:37,752 --> 01:11:39,329
Kevin!

785
01:12:03,945 --> 01:12:05,107
And so help me,

786
01:12:05,196 --> 01:12:07,402
I never wanna
see another one of

787
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:09,779
your goofy, bug-eyed
faces ever again!

788
01:12:09,867 --> 01:12:11,741
- Scarlet! Scarlet! Scarlet!
- What?

789
01:12:13,246 --> 01:12:15,452
Oh, you've gotta
be kidding me!

790
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,660
Oh no, you don't!

791
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:30,845
And just for the record,
my little deviled eggs,

792
01:12:30,930 --> 01:12:34,299
you can thank Kevin for what
I'm about to do to you!

793
01:12:42,942 --> 01:12:44,816
- Bob! Stuart!
- Buddies!

794
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:47,101
Tony!

795
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:48,441
Tom!

796
01:12:48,531 --> 01:12:50,440
Chris!

797
01:12:50,533 --> 01:12:52,027
You the man!

798
01:12:52,743 --> 01:12:56,162
Buddies! Mazel tov.

799
01:13:09,635 --> 01:13:10,669
Kevin! Kevin!

800
01:13:11,804 --> 01:13:16,051
Enough! This ends now!

801
01:13:43,461 --> 01:13:45,085
Kevin!

802
01:13:45,212 --> 01:13:48,795
You imbecile!
Have fun exploding!

803
01:13:48,883 --> 01:13:49,997
Baby!

804
01:13:50,968 --> 01:13:52,213
What's the rush?

805
01:13:52,303 --> 01:13:53,465
Got to get out of here!

806
01:13:54,764 --> 01:13:57,433
Let us go!

807
01:14:04,899 --> 01:14:07,224
No, no, no, no!

808
01:14:14,992 --> 01:14:18,278
Kevin!

809
01:14:38,683 --> 01:14:41,256
Kevin...

810
01:15:45,082 --> 01:15:46,576
Stuart?

811
01:15:46,667 --> 01:15:48,042
Bob?

812
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,078
Okay.

813
01:16:05,811 --> 01:16:12,229
Ladies and gentlemen, we are here
today to celebrate the Minions!

814
01:16:18,282 --> 01:16:21,865
The country owes you
a great debt of gratitude.

815
01:16:22,703 --> 01:16:27,698
Bob, you were a wise and noble
king for all of eight hours.

816
01:16:28,292 --> 01:16:33,713
So for you, I offer this tiny
crown for your teddy bear, Tim.

817
01:16:38,052 --> 01:16:39,380
Oh, very good, Bob!

818
01:16:41,347 --> 01:16:43,423
Oh, spectacular!

819
01:16:43,516 --> 01:16:46,433
I'm so proud
of you boys!

820
01:16:46,519 --> 01:16:49,306
Oh, Stuart.

821
01:16:49,396 --> 01:16:54,936
For you, I have this beautiful,
super-duper, incredible...

822
01:16:55,027 --> 01:16:57,483
snow globe!

823
01:16:57,571 --> 01:16:59,205
Eh? Poglobe?

824
01:16:59,532 --> 01:17:02,782
And look, look,
hours of excitement!

825
01:17:04,995 --> 01:17:07,830
Yippee. Uh, gracias.

826
01:17:10,501 --> 01:17:13,502
Stuart, we're just
messing with you!

827
01:17:14,421 --> 01:17:17,588
Don't be mad at me,
it was Kevin's idea.

828
01:17:17,675 --> 01:17:19,667
Kevin!

829
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:22,761
We have a much
better surprise for you!

830
01:17:22,847 --> 01:17:25,384
Super mega ukulele!

831
01:17:59,633 --> 01:18:01,342
Poglobe.

832
01:18:02,469 --> 01:18:03,668
Thank you.

833
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:05,713
Right...

834
01:18:06,432 --> 01:18:08,555
And finally, Kevin!

835
01:18:11,478 --> 01:18:14,978
You are a hero of
the highest order.

836
01:18:15,065 --> 01:18:19,277
For your bravery and valor,
I am knighting you.

837
01:18:20,029 --> 01:18:23,314
From here on out,
you are Sir Kevin.

838
01:18:24,283 --> 01:18:25,481
Well done.

839
01:18:35,628 --> 01:18:37,869
<i>What a beautiful moment!</i>

840
01:18:37,963 --> 01:18:40,419
Kumbaya!
Kumbaya!

841
01:18:40,507 --> 01:18:45,584
<i>The nation, nay, the world was
celebrating Kevin, Stuart and Bob.</i>

842
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:48,965
<i>The last few thousand years
were rough, no question,</i>

843
01:18:49,058 --> 01:18:52,640
<i>but things were
finally going their way!</i>

844
01:18:53,187 --> 01:18:55,938
<i>Kevin had never
been more proud.</i>

845
01:18:56,774 --> 01:18:58,683
<i>But something was missing.</i>

846
01:18:59,234 --> 01:19:01,939
Yes, good show, good show!

847
01:19:03,197 --> 01:19:05,688
My crown is gone! It's gone!

848
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:07,237
Blimey!

849
01:19:07,409 --> 01:19:09,034
- She's lost the crown!
- Oh, my days!

850
01:19:13,874 --> 01:19:14,953
Scarlet?

851
01:19:15,042 --> 01:19:18,458
Scarlet! Hey!

852
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:20,585
Scarlet! Hey!

853
01:19:20,673 --> 01:19:24,457
They took everything from me!
My castle! My reputation!

854
01:19:24,551 --> 01:19:27,303
Things look bleak,
baby, I'm not gonna lie!

855
01:19:27,388 --> 01:19:30,638
But now at least
I have my crown!

856
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:47,570
Child,
give me that back.

857
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:51,403
No, I don't think so!

858
01:19:51,495 --> 01:19:54,781
You have no idea who
you're messing with!

859
01:19:54,873 --> 01:19:57,709
I am the greatest
super-villain of all time!

860
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:00,837
Were you?

861
01:20:08,887 --> 01:20:10,880
Buddies...

862
01:20:28,741 --> 01:20:29,858
Boss!

863
01:20:32,036 --> 01:20:35,286
Get back! Are you really going
to allow that little penguin

864
01:20:35,372 --> 01:20:38,159
to make off with my crown?

865
01:20:40,252 --> 01:20:41,497
Herb.

866
01:20:42,171 --> 01:20:43,831
I'm done.

867
01:20:48,177 --> 01:20:49,339
For me?

868
01:20:53,015 --> 01:20:54,177
Bye-bye!

869
01:20:54,808 --> 01:20:56,267
Big boss!

870
01:20:58,353 --> 01:21:02,980
<i>And that is how the Minions
found their new boss.</i>

871
01:21:03,067 --> 01:21:06,601
<i>He was cunning,
he was evil, he was perfect.</i>

872
01:21:06,695 --> 01:21:10,479
<i>He was despicable.</i>

873
01:21:53,659 --> 01:21:54,738
- Banana!
- Banana!

874
01:21:54,868 --> 01:21:55,947
Banana!

875
01:21:57,412 --> 01:21:59,820
Banana! Banana! Banana!

876
01:22:08,215 --> 01:22:09,294
Banana!

877
01:22:53,844 --> 01:22:57,343
Cheese! Cheese! Cheese!

878
01:28:42,776 --> 01:28:44,685
Bob...

879
01:29:55,557 --> 01:29:57,596
Hey! Come back here!

880
01:30:44,105 --> 01:30:45,481
Freeze ray!
