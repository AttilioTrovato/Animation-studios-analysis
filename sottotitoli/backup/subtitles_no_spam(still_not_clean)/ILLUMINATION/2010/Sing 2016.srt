1
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:34,644
<i>Illumination...</i>

2
00:00:34,677 --> 00:00:36,779
<i>Illumination...</i>

3
00:00:36,813 --> 00:00:42,119
<i>Illumination!</i>

4
00:01:28,765 --> 00:01:30,333
Places, everyone.

5
00:01:48,351 --> 00:01:53,156
<i>Once there was a way</i>

6
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:58,329
<i>To get back homeward</i>

7
00:02:00,763 --> 00:02:04,934
<i>Once there was a way</i>

8
00:02:04,968 --> 00:02:08,305
<i>To get back home</i>

9
00:02:08,339 --> 00:02:10,640
<i>Sleep, pretty darling</i>

10
00:02:10,673 --> 00:02:13,510
<i>Do not cry</i>

11
00:02:13,543 --> 00:02:17,680
<i>And I will sing a lullaby</i>

12
00:02:17,715 --> 00:02:19,382
This was it.

13
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:21,551
The moment it all began.

14
00:02:21,584 --> 00:02:23,520
The moment an ordinary little guy

15
00:02:23,553 --> 00:02:25,888
fell in love with the theater.

16
00:02:25,922 --> 00:02:27,757
Everything about it.

17
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:30,193
The lights,
the way the scenery moved,

18
00:02:30,227 --> 00:02:31,794
even the smell.

19
00:02:31,828 --> 00:02:34,531
He was only six years old,
but his plans to become

20
00:02:34,564 --> 00:02:38,301
the first koala bear in space
were suddenly toast.

21
00:02:38,335 --> 00:02:40,271
Some folks may have said

22
00:02:40,303 --> 00:02:42,805
he grew up to be the greatest
showman the city has ever seen.

23
00:02:42,839 --> 00:02:45,508
Some called him a visionary,
a maverick.

24
00:02:45,542 --> 00:02:49,280
Sure, some folks said he was
as crazy as he was stubborn,

25
00:02:49,312 --> 00:02:52,915
but I say wonder and magic
don't come easy, pal.

26
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:55,718
And, oh, there would never be
any doubt,

27
00:02:55,753 --> 00:02:58,321
the name Buster Moon would go down

28
00:02:58,355 --> 00:03:00,223
in entertainment history.

29
00:03:00,257 --> 00:03:01,858
And I should know...

30
00:03:01,891 --> 00:03:04,961
- Because I am Buster...
- Moon!

31
00:03:04,994 --> 00:03:06,963
Open this door!

32
00:03:06,996 --> 00:03:09,266
Good morning, Mr. Moon.

33
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,901
Miss Crawly. What...
What's going on?

34
00:03:11,934 --> 00:03:15,272
You got a lot of animals
waiting to see you, Mr. Moon.

35
00:03:15,306 --> 00:03:16,906
I do?

36
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:19,842
Holy moly, I really do.

37
00:03:19,876 --> 00:03:22,712
Yeah, it's the stage crew
from your last show.

38
00:03:22,745 --> 00:03:24,714
They say their paychecks bounced.

39
00:03:24,747 --> 00:03:26,549
Tell 'em I'll call up the bank
and make sure

40
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:27,584
they're paid tout de suite.

41
00:03:27,617 --> 00:03:29,486
Oh, I got Judith from the bank

42
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,554
holding on line two right now, sir.

43
00:03:31,588 --> 00:03:33,623
Actually, I'm gonna have
to call her back.

44
00:03:33,656 --> 00:03:35,592
What should I tell her this time?

45
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:38,395
Tell her Buster Moon is out to lunch.

46
00:03:38,429 --> 00:03:40,798
Moon! Open this door!

47
00:03:42,832 --> 00:03:44,301
Come on, Moon!

48
00:03:44,335 --> 00:03:46,403
I know you're in there!

49
00:03:56,347 --> 00:03:59,316
Moon! Open this door!

50
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:00,683
<i>Hey!</i>

51
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,822
<i>Well, my temperature is rising</i>

52
00:04:04,854 --> 00:04:07,757
<i>And my feet on the floor,
crazy people knocking</i>

53
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,326
<i>'Cause they're wanting some more</i>

54
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,294
<i>Let me in, baby</i>

55
00:04:11,328 --> 00:04:12,995
<i>I don't know what you've got</i>

56
00:04:13,029 --> 00:04:15,698
<i>But you'd better take it easy,
this place is hot</i>

57
00:04:15,733 --> 00:04:17,600
<i>And I'm so glad</i>

58
00:04:17,634 --> 00:04:19,702
<i>We made it</i>

59
00:04:19,737 --> 00:04:22,004
<i>So glad we made it</i>

60
00:04:22,038 --> 00:04:24,541
<i>You got to gimme some lovin'</i>

61
00:04:24,574 --> 00:04:26,844
<i>Gimme, gimme some lovin'</i>

62
00:04:26,876 --> 00:04:28,345
<i>Gimme some lovin'</i>

63
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:30,381
<i>Gimme, gimme some lovin'</i>

64
00:04:30,413 --> 00:04:31,749
<i>Gimme some lovin'</i>

65
00:04:31,781 --> 00:04:33,851
<i>Every day...</i>

66
00:04:33,883 --> 00:04:35,618
<i>In your mind</i>

67
00:04:35,652 --> 00:04:39,390
<i>Could you ever be
really close to me?</i>

68
00:04:39,422 --> 00:04:42,792
<i>I can tell the way you smile</i>

69
00:04:42,825 --> 00:04:46,696
<i>If I feel that I could be
certain then</i>

70
00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:50,700
<i>I would say the things
I want to say to...</i>

71
00:04:55,672 --> 00:04:58,575
Hmm, thought I heard
someone singing there.

72
00:04:58,608 --> 00:05:00,610
Ah, whatever.

73
00:05:02,111 --> 00:05:04,714
Guys, listen.
Stay where you are.

74
00:05:04,747 --> 00:05:05,915
The cops are here in...

75
00:05:05,948 --> 00:05:07,584
What are you...?

76
00:05:07,617 --> 00:05:09,486
- Hold it right there!
- Yeah, I'll get him!

77
00:05:12,523 --> 00:05:14,323
Go, go, go!

78
00:05:20,863 --> 00:05:23,833
Johnny, you were supposed
to be keeping a lookout!

79
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:25,034
Sorry, Dad.

80
00:05:25,067 --> 00:05:26,437
And where's your mask?

81
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,516
<i>Do you ever feel</i>

82
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,384
<i>Like a plastic bag</i>

83
00:05:41,418 --> 00:05:43,019
<i>Drifting through the wind</i>

84
00:05:43,052 --> 00:05:45,422
<i>Wanting to start again?</i>

85
00:05:45,456 --> 00:05:46,824
<i>Do you ever feel</i>

86
00:05:46,856 --> 00:05:48,725
<i>Feel so paper thin...</i>

87
00:05:48,758 --> 00:05:51,027
Look at me. I'm Mommy!

88
00:05:52,563 --> 00:05:54,565
Caspar, get off the table.

89
00:05:54,597 --> 00:05:58,401
Rosita, have you seen my car keys?

90
00:06:01,103 --> 00:06:02,639
Norman, would you please tell them

91
00:06:02,672 --> 00:06:04,006
what a good singer I am?

92
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,108
Oh, yeah, you were great, honey.

93
00:06:06,142 --> 00:06:08,678
By the way, the bathroom sink
is blocked again.

94
00:06:08,711 --> 00:06:10,481
Bye, honey!

95
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:16,587
<i>Like the Fourth of July</i>

96
00:06:16,619 --> 00:06:18,087
<i>'Cause, baby, you're a...</i>

97
00:06:21,492 --> 00:06:23,926
One, two, one, two, three, four!

98
00:06:23,961 --> 00:06:26,597
<i>- I don't wanna talk to ya
- Nothing to say</i>

99
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:28,898
<i>- I don't wanna walk with ya
- Outta my way</i>

100
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:31,901
<i>- I'm not gonna play for ya
- Don't want to play</i>

101
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:34,837
<i>- I don't need anyone else
- Yeah, yeah</i>

102
00:06:34,872 --> 00:06:37,540
<i>I live my life by myself,
yeah, yeah</i>

103
00:06:37,574 --> 00:06:39,642
<i>I can't stand the things
that you say</i>

104
00:06:39,676 --> 00:06:42,111
<i>I'm not listening any...</i>

105
00:06:42,144 --> 00:06:44,180
Oh, my gosh.

106
00:06:44,213 --> 00:06:46,783
I thought you guys said
you were musicians.

107
00:06:48,017 --> 00:06:49,218
Ash, babe,

108
00:06:49,252 --> 00:06:50,720
I'm the lead singer, okay?

109
00:06:50,753 --> 00:06:52,054
Just stick to the backing vocals.

110
00:06:52,088 --> 00:06:53,891
Sorry, I get carried away.

111
00:06:53,923 --> 00:06:55,492
Yeah, I know, right?

112
00:06:55,526 --> 00:06:57,794
It just kind of ruins my song,
you know?

113
00:07:01,864 --> 00:07:05,868
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

114
00:07:05,903 --> 00:07:09,939
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

115
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:12,643
<i>Happy birthday</i>

116
00:07:12,675 --> 00:07:16,178
<i>Dear Grandpa</i>

117
00:07:16,212 --> 00:07:22,619
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

118
00:07:25,622 --> 00:07:26,889
What?

119
00:07:26,924 --> 00:07:28,825
Come on, make your wish.

120
00:07:28,858 --> 00:07:31,127
I wish you'd join a choir.

121
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,729
A local band or something.

122
00:07:32,762 --> 00:07:34,531
I tried.

123
00:07:34,565 --> 00:07:36,533
Hey, hey, Dad, we've been over this.

124
00:07:36,567 --> 00:07:38,768
So she's a little shy.
So what?

125
00:07:38,801 --> 00:07:43,640
If I had a voice like Meena's,
I'd be a superstar by now!

126
00:07:43,674 --> 00:07:46,043
Just singing... Ooh, yeah.

127
00:07:46,075 --> 00:07:48,110
- I said ooh, yeah...
- Sure you would, Grandpa.

128
00:07:48,144 --> 00:07:50,713
Now blow out your candles.

129
00:08:06,563 --> 00:08:07,564
A penny?

130
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:09,066
How dare you!

131
00:08:09,098 --> 00:08:11,534
I happen to have studied
at the Lincoln School of Music.

132
00:08:11,568 --> 00:08:13,269
Sorry, it's all I got right now.

133
00:08:13,302 --> 00:08:15,304
Oh, is that so?

134
00:08:17,273 --> 00:08:19,108
- All right, prove it, pal.
- What?

135
00:08:19,141 --> 00:08:21,612
- Empty your pockets right now.
- Trying to find...

136
00:08:21,644 --> 00:08:23,279
- What is this you got here?
- Just trying to find...

137
00:08:23,312 --> 00:08:24,781
What do you smoke out of this?

138
00:08:24,814 --> 00:08:26,717
That's my inhaler.

139
00:08:26,749 --> 00:08:29,686
Aha! I knew it!

140
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,853
You all saw it.

141
00:08:30,887 --> 00:08:32,121
You all saw it right here.

142
00:08:32,154 --> 00:08:33,724
The monkey lied.

143
00:08:33,756 --> 00:08:35,124
I forgot I had that.

144
00:08:35,157 --> 00:08:37,836
And next time, pick on someone
your own size!

145
00:08:38,027 --> 00:08:39,028
Bully!

146
00:08:49,106 --> 00:08:51,307
Take care of her, will you?

147
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:54,745
She may look old and rusty,
but she is a classic.

148
00:09:00,117 --> 00:09:01,784
Okay, listen.

149
00:09:01,818 --> 00:09:03,820
We both know that my theater
has been going through

150
00:09:03,853 --> 00:09:06,757
some pretty rough times lately,
but as the saying goes,

151
00:09:06,789 --> 00:09:08,190
for every cloud, a silver lining.

152
00:09:08,745 --> 00:09:09,592
We've got...

153
00:09:09,626 --> 00:09:10,960
Hold on right there, Buster.

154
00:09:10,993 --> 00:09:12,995
My dad, he heard I was
gonna see you today,

155
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:15,032
and he was all like,
Eddie, you tell that koala

156
00:09:15,064 --> 00:09:16,767
I'm not funding any more
of those shows.

157
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,167
And that's final.
Those were his words.

158
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,335
Well, your dad's right.

159
00:09:19,368 --> 00:09:21,003
Those shows were the problem.

160
00:09:21,038 --> 00:09:22,972
War of Attrition.
Rosie Takes a Bow.

161
00:09:23,005 --> 00:09:24,874
I mean, nobody wants to see
that stuff anymore.

162
00:09:24,907 --> 00:09:26,275
So, what do I do?

163
00:09:26,308 --> 00:09:28,244
- Quit?
- No.

164
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:31,922
I give 'em a show they cannot
resist, which is gonna be...

165
00:09:32,381 --> 00:09:34,116
Just one more minute,
s'il vous plaît.

166
00:09:34,151 --> 00:09:36,252
Merci.

167
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:38,655
Don't speak French.
They speak English here.

168
00:09:38,689 --> 00:09:41,891
Now, my next show is gonna be...
Drumroll, please...

169
00:09:43,426 --> 00:09:45,662
A singing competition.

170
00:09:45,696 --> 00:09:47,764
A singing competition?

171
00:09:47,798 --> 00:09:49,398
Who wants to see another one of those?

172
00:09:49,432 --> 00:09:51,168
Everyone!
Just think.

173
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,636
Your neighbor,
the grocery store manager,

174
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,337
that chicken... right there!

175
00:09:55,371 --> 00:09:57,674
Everyone in this city gets a shot

176
00:09:57,708 --> 00:10:00,209
at being a star live on my stage.

177
00:10:00,242 --> 00:10:02,378
Buster, this is a terrible idea.

178
00:10:02,411 --> 00:10:03,814
Oh, no, it's not.

179
00:10:03,846 --> 00:10:05,982
Real talent from real life.

180
00:10:06,015 --> 00:10:09,251
That's what audiences want,
and I'm gonna give it to 'em!

181
00:10:09,285 --> 00:10:11,253
All right, well...

182
00:10:11,287 --> 00:10:12,955
Can we please just get out of here?

183
00:10:12,989 --> 00:10:14,323
Don't you want to eat?

184
00:10:14,356 --> 00:10:16,025
Yeah, but we can't afford any of this.

185
00:10:16,058 --> 00:10:17,694
Yes, I know, and that's why...

186
00:10:17,728 --> 00:10:19,662
I brought sandwiches.

187
00:10:20,997 --> 00:10:23,165
That's not allowed.

188
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,067
What, you don't like
peanut butter and jelly?

189
00:10:25,102 --> 00:10:26,402
- Excuse me, sir.
- Okay, look.

190
00:10:26,435 --> 00:10:28,671
I got cream cheese, I got banana...

191
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:36,345
- You okay?
- Yep. Never better.

192
00:10:38,815 --> 00:10:41,250
Miss Crawly?

193
00:10:41,283 --> 00:10:42,985
Hello?

194
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:45,287
Who is it?

195
00:10:45,321 --> 00:10:46,689
It's me.

196
00:10:46,723 --> 00:10:48,357
Your boss, Mr. Moon.

197
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:50,326
- Oh, hello, Mr. Moon.
- There we go.

198
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:52,929
Now, I need you to add
the following information

199
00:10:52,962 --> 00:10:54,997
- to our publicity flyers.
- Yes, sir.

200
00:10:55,031 --> 00:10:56,799
The winner of the singing contest

201
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:59,802
will receive a grand prize of...

202
00:10:59,836 --> 00:11:02,805
$935.

203
00:11:03,361 --> 00:11:04,440
Gonna need more than that.

204
00:11:04,473 --> 00:11:05,708
Just a second.

205
00:11:08,911 --> 00:11:09,979
There.

206
00:11:10,012 --> 00:11:11,413
There!

207
00:11:11,447 --> 00:11:13,282
$1,000.

208
00:11:13,315 --> 00:11:17,186
- You got that?
- $1,000...

209
00:11:24,493 --> 00:11:26,195
Print 'em up on every single sheet

210
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:28,097
of paper we have left
and let's spread the word

211
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:29,166
right away, okay?

212
00:11:29,198 --> 00:11:30,801
Yes, uh, yes, sir.

213
00:11:34,171 --> 00:11:37,006
Oh, okay.
Come on out of there.

214
00:11:44,046 --> 00:11:47,116
Ah, the winds of change.

215
00:11:47,149 --> 00:11:49,118
Yep, when this show's a hit,

216
00:11:49,151 --> 00:11:51,822
I'm gonna get you a fresh coat of paint.

217
00:11:51,854 --> 00:11:54,090
How are we doing
with those flyers, Miss Crawly?

218
00:11:54,123 --> 00:11:56,827
Oh, yes, sir.
We're all good to go here.

219
00:11:58,394 --> 00:12:01,198
Miss Crawly, no!
No, no, no, no, no, no!

220
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:03,032
Oopsie-daisy.

221
00:12:03,065 --> 00:12:06,203
Oh, well, I guess that's
one way to spread the word.

222
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:22,819
Hey, Lance, look at this.

223
00:12:22,853 --> 00:12:24,453
Ash, babe, hey!

224
00:12:34,096 --> 00:12:36,198
- You make a withdrawal!
- Yeah.

225
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,236
Meena!

226
00:12:45,608 --> 00:12:47,109
Hey, hey, hey!

227
00:12:47,143 --> 00:12:48,444
What do you think you...?

228
00:12:50,446 --> 00:12:51,513
Yeah.

229
00:13:18,641 --> 00:13:20,309
Let's go to work.

230
00:13:23,013 --> 00:13:25,047
And cue the crazy old lizard.

231
00:13:25,081 --> 00:13:26,883
Good morning, Mr. Moon.

232
00:13:26,917 --> 00:13:28,184
Indeed it is, Miss Crawly.

233
00:13:28,217 --> 00:13:29,551
Top of the morning to you.

234
00:13:29,585 --> 00:13:31,253
I made you some coffee.

235
00:13:31,288 --> 00:13:33,255
You did? Where is it?

236
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:36,993
Oh, I got a little thirsty
on the way up those stairs.

237
00:13:37,027 --> 00:13:40,362
- Shall I go open the doors now?
- The doors?

238
00:13:40,397 --> 00:13:42,531
Well, you've got a lot
of animals waiting in line

239
00:13:42,564 --> 00:13:43,900
to audition, Mr. Moon.

240
00:13:43,934 --> 00:13:45,067
I do?

241
00:13:47,636 --> 00:13:49,940
Holy moly, I really do.

242
00:13:53,242 --> 00:13:55,377
I swear to you, Eddie, this is no joke.

243
00:13:55,412 --> 00:13:57,446
Look, just get down here
and see for yourself.

244
00:13:57,479 --> 00:13:58,881
I gotta go.

245
00:13:58,915 --> 00:14:00,582
This is it, Miss Crawly.

246
00:14:00,616 --> 00:14:04,586
Get your scaly tail downstairs
and throw those doors open wide.

247
00:14:14,431 --> 00:14:16,465
Okay, one at a time, please.

248
00:14:16,498 --> 00:14:18,034
Calm down.

249
00:14:18,068 --> 00:14:19,902
<i>Got me looking so crazy right now</i>

250
00:14:19,936 --> 00:14:22,905
<i>Your love's got me
looking so crazy right now</i>

251
00:14:22,939 --> 00:14:25,207
<i>Got me looking so crazy right now</i>

252
00:14:25,241 --> 00:14:27,509
<i>Your touch has got me
looking so crazy right now...</i>

253
00:14:27,543 --> 00:14:29,578
<i>Rah, rah, ah-ah-ah</i>

254
00:14:29,611 --> 00:14:31,448
<i>Roma, ma-ma-ma</i>

255
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,950
<i>Gaga, ooh-la-la</i>

256
00:14:33,984 --> 00:14:35,651
<i>Want your bad romance...</i>

257
00:14:35,684 --> 00:14:37,386
<i>- Jump!
- Jump, jump, jump</i>

258
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:39,990
<i>Might as well jump...</i>

259
00:14:40,022 --> 00:14:41,323
Bye, Iggy.
Bye, Perry. Bye, Carla.

260
00:14:41,358 --> 00:14:42,959
Bye, Gail.
Bye, Rory. Bye, Mickey.

261
00:14:42,993 --> 00:14:44,493
Bye, Moe. Bye, Nelson.
Bye, Hannah.

262
00:14:44,526 --> 00:14:45,962
Bye, Tess.
Bye-bye, Caspar.

263
00:14:57,606 --> 00:14:59,241
<i>Baaa-by...</i>

264
00:14:59,275 --> 00:15:03,013
<i>I compare you to a kiss
from a rose...</i>

265
00:15:03,045 --> 00:15:04,646
<i>L-U-C-K</i>

266
00:15:06,016 --> 00:15:08,284
<i>L-U-C-K...</i>

267
00:15:08,317 --> 00:15:11,587
<i>I love my shoes, I love my shoes...</i>

268
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,555
<i>Come, my lady, come, come, my lady</i>

269
00:15:13,589 --> 00:15:16,192
<i>You're my butterfly sugar baby...</i>

270
00:15:16,225 --> 00:15:18,594
Let's hear from a few more
of the folks in line.

271
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:21,398
- What about you, sir?
- Well, Bob, I'm a lab technician

272
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:23,033
for a leading pharmaceutical company,

273
00:15:23,065 --> 00:15:24,967
but I was born with a gift.

274
00:15:25,001 --> 00:15:27,169
And that gift is to sing.

275
00:15:32,274 --> 00:15:35,512
<i>Oh, my gosh, look at her butt</i>

276
00:15:35,544 --> 00:15:38,415
<i>Oh, my gosh, look at her...</i>

277
00:15:38,447 --> 00:15:41,083
<i>- I live my life by myself
- Yeah, yeah</i>

278
00:15:41,117 --> 00:15:43,452
<i>- I can't stand the things that you say
- Yeah, yeah</i>

279
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:46,388
<i>I'm not listening anyway...</i>

280
00:15:46,423 --> 00:15:50,326
<i>Yeah...</i>

281
00:16:01,303 --> 00:16:04,706
<i>Lollipop, lollipop,
ooh-lolli, lolli, lolli</i>

282
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:07,009
<i>Lollipop, lollipop,
ooh-lolli, lolli...</i>

283
00:16:07,043 --> 00:16:08,644
Oi, Dad. Just going out.

284
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:10,712
Well, don't be long.
I got the gang coming over.

285
00:16:10,746 --> 00:16:14,551
<i>Lollipop, lollipop,
ooh-lolli, lolli, lolli</i>

286
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:17,187
<i>Lollipop, lollipop,
ooh-lolli...</i>

287
00:16:17,219 --> 00:16:19,155
Well, look, I mean,
I'm sure you're gonna get a lot

288
00:16:19,189 --> 00:16:21,191
of namby-pamby animals in here
saying things like...

289
00:16:21,223 --> 00:16:22,524
Oh, it's not winning.

290
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:23,792
It's the taking part that counts.

291
00:16:23,826 --> 00:16:25,727
Yeah, yeah. Not me, pal.
I'm here to win.

292
00:16:25,761 --> 00:16:28,364
That prize, it's mine.

293
00:16:28,397 --> 00:16:31,067
<i>People say, yo, Humpty,
you're really funny-looking</i>

294
00:16:31,101 --> 00:16:33,535
<i>That's all right
'cause I get things cookin'...</i>

295
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:36,038
<i>Working 9:00 to 5:00...</i>

296
00:16:38,108 --> 00:16:40,076
<i>We can dance if we want to...</i>

297
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:43,179
<i>Aserejé ja de jé, de jebe tu de...</i>

298
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:51,221
<i>Ride like the wind</i>

299
00:16:51,253 --> 00:16:52,554
<i>Ride like the...</i>

300
00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:55,157
<i>Ben, the two of us</i>

301
00:16:55,191 --> 00:16:58,294
<i>Need look no more...</i>

302
00:16:58,327 --> 00:17:00,230
<i>This ain't love</i>

303
00:17:00,262 --> 00:17:03,332
<i>It's clear to see</i>

304
00:17:03,365 --> 00:17:08,637
<i>But, darling, stay with me</i>

305
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:10,806
Wow! Thank you, Johnny.

306
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:13,109
Okay, next up...

307
00:17:13,143 --> 00:17:15,577
- We have Meena.
- Good luck out there.

308
00:17:15,612 --> 00:17:17,846
All right, come on. Here we go.
Come on, you can do it.

309
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,715
You can do it. Okay...

310
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:21,583
Oh, I'm s...
Oh, I'm sorry...

311
00:17:21,618 --> 00:17:24,453
Okay. Hey, it's all right.
You know, it's all right.

312
00:17:24,486 --> 00:17:26,256
Take it away, Meena.

313
00:17:29,871 --> 00:17:31,347
Okay...

314
00:17:31,693 --> 00:17:33,829
Anytime, now.

315
00:17:35,864 --> 00:17:37,799
Do you want to start over?

316
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,302
All right, enough of that.

317
00:17:40,336 --> 00:17:41,737
That's quite enough of that.

318
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:42,871
That's it. Come on.

319
00:17:42,905 --> 00:17:44,340
Off the stage, Helga.

320
00:17:44,373 --> 00:17:46,308
Go on. You're useless.
Thanks.

321
00:17:46,342 --> 00:17:47,843
Right. Here we go.
Hit it!

322
00:17:52,282 --> 00:17:57,886
<i>Every time it rains, it rains</i>

323
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,257
<i>Pennies from heaven</i>

324
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:05,161
<i>Don't you know each cloud contains</i>

325
00:18:06,563 --> 00:18:10,132
<i>Pennies from heaven...</i>

326
00:18:13,235 --> 00:18:15,804
<i>You've just got ignite</i>

327
00:18:15,837 --> 00:18:17,839
<i>The light</i>

328
00:18:17,873 --> 00:18:21,643
<i>And let it shine</i>

329
00:18:21,678 --> 00:18:25,514
<i>Just own the night</i>

330
00:18:25,547 --> 00:18:28,784
<i>Like the Fourth of July</i>

331
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:32,654
<i>'Cause, baby, you're a firework</i>

332
00:18:32,689 --> 00:18:34,856
<i>Come on, show 'em what...</i>

333
00:18:40,862 --> 00:18:43,532
Okay, that's everyone, Mr. Moon.

334
00:18:43,982 --> 00:18:45,301
All right, call everyone

335
00:18:45,335 --> 00:18:46,868
back to stage, Miss Crawly,
and let's get...

336
00:18:46,902 --> 00:18:48,537
Hello!

337
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:51,840
Can I have everybody back
to stage, please?

338
00:18:51,873 --> 00:18:53,942
Everyone come back to stage
for selection.

339
00:18:53,976 --> 00:18:56,212
Okay.
Thank you, Miss Crawly.

340
00:18:56,246 --> 00:18:58,514
You're welcome, Mr. Moon.

341
00:19:06,922 --> 00:19:08,790
All right.

342
00:19:08,824 --> 00:19:10,426
Let's see, now.

343
00:19:15,265 --> 00:19:20,202
I'll take...

344
00:19:20,236 --> 00:19:21,770
- you guys.
- Yes!

345
00:19:21,803 --> 00:19:23,505
And which one of you is the girl?

346
00:19:24,269 --> 00:19:25,241
Very funny.

347
00:19:25,275 --> 00:19:27,976
Loud and horrible,
but shows promise.

348
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:29,445
Welcome to the show.

349
00:19:29,478 --> 00:19:31,680
Cool.
I guess we could hang.

350
00:19:31,713 --> 00:19:32,948
No, no.
I just want her, not you.

351
00:19:32,981 --> 00:19:34,450
What?

352
00:19:34,483 --> 00:19:36,218
All right, the rest of the group acts,

353
00:19:36,252 --> 00:19:37,287
thank you so much.

354
00:19:38,354 --> 00:19:39,588
Oh, don't feel bad, folks.

355
00:19:39,621 --> 00:19:41,223
There will be a ten percent discount

356
00:19:41,257 --> 00:19:42,558
on tickets for everyone.

357
00:19:42,591 --> 00:19:43,959
Yeah, sure, thanks a lot.

358
00:19:43,992 --> 00:19:47,297
Let's get out of here, Ash.

359
00:19:47,329 --> 00:19:48,930
Ash?

360
00:19:49,381 --> 00:19:50,499
Yeah...

361
00:19:50,532 --> 00:19:52,734
Yeah, let's go.

362
00:19:52,769 --> 00:19:55,271
Okay, soloists.

363
00:19:55,305 --> 00:19:59,741
Johnny, Mike, Pete, Richard,
Daniel and Ray.

364
00:20:00,876 --> 00:20:01,877
Mike!

365
00:20:03,512 --> 00:20:04,913
I've gotta have you in my show.

366
00:20:04,946 --> 00:20:06,915
Oh, I... if you insist.

367
00:20:06,948 --> 00:20:07,983
And I'll take Pete...

368
00:20:08,016 --> 00:20:09,551
Ooh, yeah!

369
00:20:09,585 --> 00:20:11,720
And one more.

370
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:13,355
Let me see, now.

371
00:20:13,389 --> 00:20:15,692
Oh, my gosh, I am so sorry.

372
00:20:15,724 --> 00:20:18,527
Oh, what is wrong with me?

373
00:20:19,936 --> 00:20:21,463
Thanks for coming, Richard.

374
00:20:24,334 --> 00:20:26,302
Oh, my... Ray!

375
00:20:26,336 --> 00:20:27,536
Are you all right?

376
00:20:27,569 --> 00:20:29,738
Just hang in there, Ray.
I got you.

377
00:20:33,509 --> 00:20:36,912
Okay, then I'll take...

378
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,681
Daniel.
Thank you, Johnny.

379
00:20:39,716 --> 00:20:42,518
Daniel, can you hear me?

380
00:20:42,551 --> 00:20:43,785
You're in the show!

381
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,986
What?

382
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,357
Are you talking to me?

383
00:20:47,389 --> 00:20:49,359
Yes.

384
00:20:49,391 --> 00:20:52,428
I was saying that you are in...

385
00:20:52,462 --> 00:20:54,663
Oh, geez, this is gonna drive me nuts.

386
00:20:54,696 --> 00:20:56,366
Johnny, get back here.
You're in.

387
00:20:56,398 --> 00:20:58,800
Thank you, Daniel. Good-bye.

388
00:20:58,835 --> 00:21:00,302
Yes!

389
00:21:00,336 --> 00:21:02,568
Okay. That's everyone on my list.

390
00:21:03,994 --> 00:21:05,307
Wait a second.

391
00:21:05,341 --> 00:21:06,508
Rosita.

392
00:21:06,542 --> 00:21:08,009
- Is Rosita still here?
- Oh, yes.

393
00:21:08,043 --> 00:21:09,711
Yes, I'm here.

394
00:21:09,746 --> 00:21:11,046
Rosita, Rosita, Rosita.

395
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:13,750
Great set of pipes, but boring to watch.

396
00:21:13,782 --> 00:21:15,317
I knew it.

397
00:21:15,351 --> 00:21:17,719
So, what should I do?

398
00:21:17,754 --> 00:21:21,357
I could partner you up with Gunter.

399
00:21:21,391 --> 00:21:22,824
Gunter! Where are you?

400
00:21:22,859 --> 00:21:25,594
Ja! Ja! This is me.

401
00:21:28,364 --> 00:21:30,366
Ja!

402
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,868
It's gonna spice things up on stage.

403
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,969
Wait. You want us to sing together?

404
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:36,506
Ja! The two of us together,
you joking me?

405
00:21:36,538 --> 00:21:38,408
We're going to be spicy, no?

406
00:21:39,741 --> 00:21:42,378
That koala's a fool, Sherry-Anne.

407
00:21:42,412 --> 00:21:44,514
You are going to be a star one day!

408
00:21:44,546 --> 00:21:45,947
Auditions are over, pal.

409
00:21:45,981 --> 00:21:48,484
- Show's already been cast.
- Okay...

410
00:21:48,518 --> 00:21:50,952
you are my chosen few.

411
00:21:50,986 --> 00:21:52,522
Yes!

412
00:21:52,554 --> 00:21:53,855
This is it, folks.

413
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:57,359
A defining moment in all of our lives.

414
00:21:57,706 --> 00:21:59,429
No. No, no, no, not you guys.

415
00:21:59,461 --> 00:22:00,862
I dismissed all
of the group acts already.

416
00:22:00,897 --> 00:22:02,097
You... You can go home.

417
00:22:03,932 --> 00:22:05,867
Look, look, look, I'm really sorry,

418
00:22:05,902 --> 00:22:08,136
but all of the slots are filled.

419
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,140
No, no, no, no, listen.

420
00:22:12,174 --> 00:22:13,575
No in show.

421
00:22:13,609 --> 00:22:15,043
Good-bye-bye.

422
00:22:15,076 --> 00:22:16,578
Miss Crawly!

423
00:22:16,612 --> 00:22:18,614
Come on, you guys, out of here.

424
00:22:18,647 --> 00:22:20,450
Come on, off the stage.

425
00:22:20,482 --> 00:22:22,618
- Thank you so much.
- Hey, Moon.

426
00:22:22,651 --> 00:22:24,620
What's the story? Is the prize
really inside this thing?

427
00:22:24,653 --> 00:22:25,954
The prize? Oh, sure.

428
00:22:25,987 --> 00:22:27,389
Yes, it's all in there.

429
00:22:27,423 --> 00:22:28,724
Well, open it, will you?

430
00:22:28,757 --> 00:22:30,592
I want to see what $100,000 looks like.

431
00:22:30,626 --> 00:22:32,060
- Yeah, come on. - Me too.
- Let's have a look. - Open it.

432
00:22:32,093 --> 00:22:33,061
Yeah, yeah, go on.
Open it, Mr. Moon.

433
00:22:33,094 --> 00:22:34,062
For sure, I'll open it.

434
00:22:34,095 --> 00:22:36,064
Wait. What did you say?

435
00:22:36,097 --> 00:22:38,935
He said $100,000.

436
00:22:38,967 --> 00:22:41,036
A hundred...

437
00:22:44,139 --> 00:22:45,874
I forgot my keys.

438
00:22:45,907 --> 00:22:47,609
Koala be right back.

439
00:22:50,212 --> 00:22:52,013
For the last time, Miss Crawly,

440
00:22:52,047 --> 00:22:54,516
I'm not going to fire you.

441
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:55,984
Now, would you pull yourself together,

442
00:22:56,017 --> 00:22:58,053
and please blow that nose of yours.

443
00:22:58,086 --> 00:22:59,988
No, no, no, not in here.

444
00:23:00,021 --> 00:23:02,023
- Blow it outside.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Moon.

445
00:23:02,057 --> 00:23:03,792
- Thank you.
- Buster, what do you expect?

446
00:23:03,825 --> 00:23:06,127
- She's like 200 years old.
- Eddie, please, look.

447
00:23:06,161 --> 00:23:08,764
If your folks could just
loan me the money until...

448
00:23:08,797 --> 00:23:11,767
$100,000? Buster, come on.

449
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,201
I gotta think.
I've gotta think.

450
00:23:13,235 --> 00:23:14,971
I've gotta think.
I've got to come up

451
00:23:15,003 --> 00:23:16,672
- with a solution...
- Look, maybe it's time

452
00:23:16,705 --> 00:23:18,940
to stop thinking
and it's time to just move on.

453
00:23:18,975 --> 00:23:20,510
I mean, this theater of yours,

454
00:23:20,542 --> 00:23:23,044
you could get some decent
money for it and...

455
00:23:23,078 --> 00:23:25,013
I don't know, maybe we could
do something together.

456
00:23:25,046 --> 00:23:27,683
What? What, sit around
playing video games?

457
00:23:29,184 --> 00:23:30,819
Do you know what that is?

458
00:23:31,165 --> 00:23:32,153
It's a bucket?

459
00:23:32,187 --> 00:23:34,556
Yes, and do you know why
I have this bucket?

460
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:35,892
'Cause the roof is leaking?

461
00:23:35,924 --> 00:23:37,726
No, that's the bucket for the leak.

462
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:40,962
I have this one 'cause it
belonged to my father.

463
00:23:40,997 --> 00:23:42,664
Every day for 30 years,

464
00:23:42,698 --> 00:23:44,966
he worked his tail off
washing cars

465
00:23:45,001 --> 00:23:47,603
just so I could buy this place.

466
00:23:47,637 --> 00:23:49,639
Every day, Eddie.

467
00:23:49,671 --> 00:23:51,873
Just for me.

468
00:23:53,074 --> 00:23:55,176
Sounds like a great dad.

469
00:23:56,945 --> 00:23:58,880
So, how do you want to handle this?

470
00:24:00,582 --> 00:24:03,251
Oh, Mr. Moon,
I got Judith from the bank

471
00:24:03,285 --> 00:24:05,787
holding on line two again.

472
00:24:07,789 --> 00:24:09,991
Well, there's only one thing
I can do.

473
00:24:12,028 --> 00:24:13,529
Okay, everybody, listen up.

474
00:24:13,563 --> 00:24:15,063
I gotta send you all home.

475
00:24:15,096 --> 00:24:16,632
Right now.

476
00:24:16,666 --> 00:24:18,700
- What?
- Yep.

477
00:24:18,734 --> 00:24:20,769
'Cause, like my dad used to say,

478
00:24:20,802 --> 00:24:23,839
get a good night's sleep
and do a great day's work.

479
00:24:26,308 --> 00:24:27,909
That's right.

480
00:24:27,944 --> 00:24:30,245
Rehearsals begin first thing
tomorrow morning.

481
00:24:30,278 --> 00:24:32,682
And if you want to become stars
and win 100 grand,

482
00:24:32,714 --> 00:24:34,282
then you better be ready
to work harder

483
00:24:34,316 --> 00:24:36,586
than you've ever worked
in your lives.

484
00:24:36,618 --> 00:24:40,021
So get some sleep and dream
big dreams.

485
00:24:44,626 --> 00:24:45,794
Miss Crawly!

486
00:24:45,827 --> 00:24:47,763
Okay, come on.

487
00:24:47,796 --> 00:24:49,030
That's enough now.

488
00:24:49,065 --> 00:24:50,700
Come on, off the stage.
Please.

489
00:24:50,732 --> 00:24:52,768
- Dream big dreams?
- I know, it's good, right?

490
00:24:52,801 --> 00:24:54,102
What about the 100 grand?

491
00:24:54,135 --> 00:24:55,537
Don't you worry, Eddie.

492
00:24:55,571 --> 00:24:57,238
There's got to be a way to get it.

493
00:24:57,272 --> 00:24:59,040
What? Buster, no, listen to me!

494
00:24:59,075 --> 00:25:01,743
This show is not gonna
save your theater.

495
00:25:01,777 --> 00:25:03,613
You're at rock bottom, pal.

496
00:25:03,645 --> 00:25:04,913
Yep, and you know what's great

497
00:25:04,946 --> 00:25:06,716
about hitting rock bottom, Eddie?

498
00:25:06,748 --> 00:25:09,150
There's only one way left to go,

499
00:25:09,184 --> 00:25:11,621
and that's up.

500
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:18,126
And you can see the lucky few
leaving the theater behind me.

501
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:19,996
Now back to you in the studio, John.

502
00:25:20,028 --> 00:25:22,732
Oh, honey, please don't cry.

503
00:25:22,764 --> 00:25:24,332
You are not a failure.

504
00:25:24,366 --> 00:25:25,834
There'll be other chances.

505
00:25:25,867 --> 00:25:28,236
- You just...
- The heck there will!

506
00:25:28,269 --> 00:25:29,639
Dad, please.

507
00:25:29,671 --> 00:25:31,641
Come on!
Don't you want this?

508
00:25:31,673 --> 00:25:33,575
Well, sure, but I messed it up.

509
00:25:33,609 --> 00:25:35,711
Then you gotta go back there
tomorrow and say,

510
00:25:35,745 --> 00:25:38,947
Mr. Moon, I demand you let me
re-audition!

511
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:41,651
Be confident! Show 'em you
ain't gonna be pushed around!

512
00:25:41,683 --> 00:25:43,318
You got that, Meena?

513
00:25:43,768 --> 00:25:44,886
Good!

514
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,588
Now, go get my cocoa.

515
00:25:48,056 --> 00:25:51,027
<i>I won't sell out for nobody</i>

516
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:53,929
<i>Won't follow no fool...</i>

517
00:25:53,962 --> 00:25:56,598
Would you stop?
I'd only be doing it for us.

518
00:25:56,632 --> 00:25:57,699
Oh, really?

519
00:25:57,733 --> 00:25:58,934
Yes, really.

520
00:25:58,967 --> 00:26:00,802
If I won that money, we could build

521
00:26:00,836 --> 00:26:02,838
our own recording studio,
start our own label.

522
00:26:02,871 --> 00:26:05,306
I mean, the whole world
would get to hear your songs.

523
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:07,876
<i>I'm not listening to my girlfriend</i>

524
00:26:07,909 --> 00:26:09,878
<i>'Cause she just wants to</i>

525
00:26:09,911 --> 00:26:11,880
<i>Sell out</i>

526
00:26:38,406 --> 00:26:39,775
Hey! Just a min...

527
00:26:39,809 --> 00:26:41,009
Oh, oh, wait. Wait!

528
00:26:42,744 --> 00:26:44,714
Oh, look at...

529
00:26:44,746 --> 00:26:45,981
I know Derek, the manager.

530
00:26:46,014 --> 00:26:48,184
He'll vouch for me.
Come on!

531
00:26:48,216 --> 00:26:50,151
Hey, Mario.

532
00:26:50,186 --> 00:26:52,387
How's it going?

533
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,855
Oh, for crying out loud.

534
00:26:53,889 --> 00:26:55,857
Oh, yeah, oh, let the bears in.

535
00:26:55,891 --> 00:26:58,026
Let the bears in. Fine.

536
00:27:01,062 --> 00:27:02,798
There he is!

537
00:27:02,832 --> 00:27:05,400
I got a surprise for you, my son.

538
00:27:05,433 --> 00:27:07,103
What's that?

539
00:27:07,135 --> 00:27:09,370
- Tell him the plan.
- Right.

540
00:27:09,404 --> 00:27:12,407
We've been told there's a ship
carrying 25 million in gold,

541
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,844
gonna dock at night right here.

542
00:27:14,876 --> 00:27:17,412
With the usual guards
here and here.

543
00:27:17,445 --> 00:27:21,449
But, lucky for us, there's
a sewer right under here.

544
00:27:21,483 --> 00:27:23,885
So the getaway driver meets us here.

545
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:27,889
And that is gonna be you
this time, Johnny.

546
00:27:27,923 --> 00:27:30,258
- What? You want me to drive?
- Yeah.

547
00:27:30,291 --> 00:27:33,261
It's time my boy had
a proper role in the gang, eh?

548
00:27:33,294 --> 00:27:34,864
Hang on, hang on, Dad.

549
00:27:34,896 --> 00:27:36,197
Barry's always been our driver.

550
00:27:36,232 --> 00:27:37,398
Barry don't mind.

551
00:27:37,432 --> 00:27:39,235
Do you, Barry?

552
00:27:39,267 --> 00:27:42,138
- No. No, that's fine.
- Yeah.

553
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:44,372
So, when exactly
is this ship coming in then?

554
00:27:44,405 --> 00:27:46,107
We ain't got a date yet.

555
00:27:46,142 --> 00:27:48,009
Probably won't be
for a while, though, will it?

556
00:27:48,043 --> 00:27:50,912
What do you care? It's the last
job we ever need to do.

557
00:27:50,946 --> 00:27:52,447
When it comes in, we go.

558
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,749
Right?

559
00:27:53,783 --> 00:27:54,750
Great.

560
00:27:54,784 --> 00:27:56,752
Can't wait.

561
00:27:56,786 --> 00:27:58,053
Hi.

562
00:27:58,086 --> 00:27:59,721
I saw your ad in the paper.

563
00:27:59,755 --> 00:28:02,023
Yes, I need a nanny
just for a couple of weeks.

564
00:28:02,057 --> 00:28:04,059
You can? Great.

565
00:28:04,092 --> 00:28:05,293
Oh, the kids?

566
00:28:05,326 --> 00:28:06,461
Yes, they're wonderful.

567
00:28:06,494 --> 00:28:08,764
They... Yeah, I have 25.

568
00:28:08,798 --> 00:28:10,498
No, I'm not joking.

569
00:28:10,532 --> 00:28:12,433
But they're really no problem...

570
00:28:12,467 --> 00:28:14,736
Hello? Hello?

571
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:16,004
Good night, Mommy.

572
00:28:19,307 --> 00:28:20,910
Hey. How was the big meeting?

573
00:28:22,778 --> 00:28:24,312
That bad, really?

574
00:28:24,345 --> 00:28:26,982
Well, I have something
really exciting to tell you.

575
00:28:27,015 --> 00:28:29,185
You make the best pie, honey.

576
00:28:29,217 --> 00:28:30,986
Listen, Norman,
I know it's short notice,

577
00:28:31,019 --> 00:28:33,254
but I could really use some help
with the kids tomorrow

578
00:28:33,289 --> 00:28:36,758
because, well, you are not
gonna believe what I did today.

579
00:28:38,294 --> 00:28:40,762
Norman, are you listening to me?

580
00:28:48,236 --> 00:28:50,940
Rehearsals begin
first thing tomorrow morning,

581
00:28:50,972 --> 00:28:53,909
so get some sleep and dream
big dreams.

582
00:29:22,238 --> 00:29:23,839
Good morning, everybody.

583
00:29:23,873 --> 00:29:26,074
Now, I want you all dressed
before breakfast.

584
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,480
Breakfast!

585
00:29:36,484 --> 00:29:39,020
Rosita, have you seen
my car keys?

586
00:29:39,054 --> 00:29:41,056
Don't forget, your keys
are in your coat pocket.

587
00:29:41,089 --> 00:29:42,858
Oh, I found 'em.

588
00:29:42,892 --> 00:29:45,060
- Bye, honey.
- Bye, Norman.

589
00:29:46,227 --> 00:29:47,595
Time for school.

590
00:29:49,865 --> 00:29:51,833
Bye, Iggy.
Bye, Perry. Bye, Carla.

591
00:29:51,867 --> 00:29:53,434
Bye, Gail. Bye, Rory.
Bye, Mickey. Bye, Moe.

592
00:29:53,468 --> 00:29:55,371
Bye, Nelson. Bye, Hannah.
Bye, Tess. Bye, Kelly.

593
00:29:55,403 --> 00:29:57,138
Bye, George. Bye, Andy.
Bye, Freddy.

594
00:29:57,172 --> 00:29:59,207
Bye-bye, Caspar.

595
00:30:04,112 --> 00:30:07,248
This contest is war.

596
00:30:07,283 --> 00:30:09,885
This stage is the battlefield.

597
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,954
Your song is your weapon.

598
00:30:12,988 --> 00:30:15,891
Now, you only get one shot
to blow that audience away,

599
00:30:15,925 --> 00:30:17,558
so choose carefully
from the list of songs

600
00:30:17,592 --> 00:30:19,360
I've selected for each of you.

601
00:30:19,395 --> 00:30:21,863
Ah, talked some sense
into that boyfriend of yours.

602
00:30:21,897 --> 00:30:23,364
Lance is an artist,

603
00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:25,301
but I wouldn't expect you
to understand that.

604
00:30:25,333 --> 00:30:27,102
You're right.
I don't understand that at all.

605
00:30:27,135 --> 00:30:30,471
Now, you'll notice each list
also includes my costume

606
00:30:30,505 --> 00:30:32,240
and performance suggestions.

607
00:30:32,273 --> 00:30:35,010
Okay? Miss Crawly will show you
to your rehearsal spaces.

608
00:30:35,044 --> 00:30:36,312
Now, let's get to work.

609
00:30:36,344 --> 00:30:37,645
Excuse me, Mr. Moon?

610
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:39,315
For some reason, it says here

611
00:30:39,347 --> 00:30:40,950
that I should be playing the piano?

612
00:30:40,982 --> 00:30:43,384
Yes, just imagine...
big, soulful guy like you

613
00:30:43,419 --> 00:30:44,954
tenderly playing the keys.

614
00:30:44,986 --> 00:30:46,454
There'll be goose bumps everywhere.

615
00:30:46,487 --> 00:30:48,623
Well, I haven't played piano
since I was a kid.

616
00:30:48,656 --> 00:30:50,926
Miss Crawly, we're gonna need
some piano lessons over here.

617
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,161
Yes, sir! Up the stairs.
I'll be right along.

618
00:30:53,194 --> 00:30:54,395
And, Pete, you're in here.

619
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:57,398
You got it, Mr. Moon.

620
00:30:57,433 --> 00:30:59,034
- Check your ego, man.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

621
00:30:59,068 --> 00:31:00,902
- Break it up, break it up, break it up.
- Oh, yeah?

622
00:31:00,936 --> 00:31:02,370
Tell Ricki. He started it.

623
00:31:02,403 --> 00:31:04,505
That's right.
Just like I started this band.

624
00:31:04,539 --> 00:31:05,673
My band, Howie.

625
00:31:05,707 --> 00:31:07,208
Oh, forgive me, Your Highness.

626
00:31:07,242 --> 00:31:08,676
Guys, come on.

627
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:11,913
No, no, no, no, no.
Hey, hey. Out. Get out of here.

628
00:31:18,454 --> 00:31:20,688
Look, just calm down

629
00:31:20,722 --> 00:31:22,958
and pick a song.

630
00:31:22,992 --> 00:31:24,392
I think we'll probably have

631
00:31:24,425 --> 00:31:26,627
a better chance of winning
if I do the singing part

632
00:31:26,661 --> 00:31:28,229
and leave the dancing part to you.

633
00:31:28,263 --> 00:31:29,999
Bah! Are you joking me?

634
00:31:30,031 --> 00:31:32,700
You are just in need of, like,
a super cool warm-up.

635
00:31:32,734 --> 00:31:34,569
Come on, let's take off

636
00:31:34,602 --> 00:31:35,937
these clothes.

637
00:31:35,971 --> 00:31:37,505
That is not necessary.

638
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,308
That is a lot of skin.

639
00:31:42,011 --> 00:31:43,578
Ah, don't you look so worried face.

640
00:31:43,611 --> 00:31:45,313
I've got one for you too.

641
00:31:45,346 --> 00:31:46,948
Hey, Porky!

642
00:31:46,982 --> 00:31:49,050
- Keep it down, will you?
- Sorry.

643
00:31:49,084 --> 00:31:51,252
Hey, Moon, you gave me the wrong list.

644
00:31:51,286 --> 00:31:53,254
Cheesy pop's not exactly my style.

645
00:31:53,288 --> 00:31:54,956
Style.
I'm glad you brought that up.

646
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:56,257
Now, let's see.

647
00:31:56,291 --> 00:31:57,393
There.

648
00:31:57,425 --> 00:31:59,327
Isn't this a great color for you?

649
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,529
I can't tell.
It's melting my eyes.

650
00:32:01,562 --> 00:32:03,564
- You got anything in black?
- Black?

651
00:32:03,598 --> 00:32:05,466
What, you want everyone to think
you're going to a funeral?

652
00:32:05,501 --> 00:32:07,002
You think you're some kind
of artsy-fartsy type?

653
00:32:07,036 --> 00:32:08,236
No, no, no, no, no.

654
00:32:08,269 --> 00:32:10,506
Bingo! Pop star princess!

655
00:32:13,441 --> 00:32:14,976
Is this part of the competition?

656
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:16,344
Okay, everybody, don't panic.

657
00:32:16,377 --> 00:32:17,612
- Don't panic.
- What's going on?

658
00:32:17,645 --> 00:32:19,280
Talk to me, Crawly.

659
00:32:19,314 --> 00:32:22,350
When did we last pay
the power company, Mr. Moon?

660
00:32:22,383 --> 00:32:24,185
Oh, for Pete's sake.

661
00:32:24,219 --> 00:32:25,987
Okay, don't worry, everybody.

662
00:32:26,021 --> 00:32:27,222
I will take care of this.

663
00:32:27,255 --> 00:32:28,524
In the meantime, you will continue

664
00:32:28,556 --> 00:32:30,025
to rehearse in the dark.

665
00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:31,659
- What?
- But I can't see anything.

666
00:32:31,692 --> 00:32:33,494
Don't you worry, Rosita.

667
00:32:33,529 --> 00:32:35,230
I have glow sticks.

668
00:32:35,263 --> 00:32:37,298
Great.
Use this time to shake off

669
00:32:37,332 --> 00:32:39,767
those first-day inhibitions,
and I'll be right back.

670
00:32:39,801 --> 00:32:41,669
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Okay, you heard him.

671
00:32:41,702 --> 00:32:43,204
Back to work now.

672
00:32:43,238 --> 00:32:45,006
Come on, everybody.

673
00:32:58,419 --> 00:32:59,654
Sorry, old girl.

674
00:32:59,687 --> 00:33:01,090
I'll fix that.

675
00:33:11,833 --> 00:33:13,768
Mr. Moon?

676
00:33:13,801 --> 00:33:15,471
You probably don't remember me,

677
00:33:15,503 --> 00:33:17,638
but I auditioned yesterday,
and I...

678
00:33:17,672 --> 00:33:19,174
Hey, listen.

679
00:33:19,208 --> 00:33:21,742
Do you think maybe you could
reach the ledge?

680
00:33:21,776 --> 00:33:23,544
That ledge?

681
00:33:25,413 --> 00:33:27,282
Whoa, that's a heck of a trunk
you've got there.

682
00:33:27,315 --> 00:33:28,783
Thanks a lot, kid.

683
00:33:28,816 --> 00:33:31,086
Mr. Moon?

684
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,490
My name is Meena,
and I baked a cake for you,

685
00:33:34,522 --> 00:33:37,493
and I was wondering
if you'd maybe give me

686
00:33:37,525 --> 00:33:39,228
- a second chance to...
- Just a moment, please.

687
00:33:40,596 --> 00:33:42,498
Be right with you.

688
00:33:56,145 --> 00:33:58,746
Yay! It's about time.

689
00:33:58,779 --> 00:34:00,448
Johnny...

690
00:34:00,481 --> 00:34:02,151
Yep, mind your head here.

691
00:34:02,183 --> 00:34:04,119
Hey, can you pull up
that scenic cable?

692
00:34:04,153 --> 00:34:05,786
- You mean this?
- Yes, that's it.

693
00:34:08,890 --> 00:34:09,857
Great!

694
00:34:09,891 --> 00:34:11,692
And the house lights?

695
00:34:17,732 --> 00:34:18,799
Ah, I know.

696
00:34:18,833 --> 00:34:20,868
Beautiful, isn't she?

697
00:34:20,902 --> 00:34:22,403
You know what, kid?

698
00:34:22,437 --> 00:34:24,339
How would you like to be
a part of this show?

699
00:34:24,372 --> 00:34:25,706
Really? Wait.

700
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:27,808
Oh, my gosh, I was just
gonna ask about that.

701
00:34:27,842 --> 00:34:30,411
Great. 'Cause I could
really use a stagehand.

702
00:34:31,512 --> 00:34:32,780
Stagehand?

703
00:34:32,813 --> 00:34:34,615
- But...
- Don't worry about it.

704
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:36,285
You're gonna pick it up in no time.

705
00:34:36,317 --> 00:34:38,219
I'll teach you everything
I know. Follow me.

706
00:34:38,253 --> 00:34:40,821
These are the rehearsal spaces
and dressing rooms,

707
00:34:40,855 --> 00:34:43,358
and up here we got workshops
and the main office.

708
00:34:43,391 --> 00:34:45,160
Up in the air!

709
00:34:45,194 --> 00:34:47,196
Touch your toes!

710
00:34:57,772 --> 00:34:59,140
Awesome.

711
00:34:59,174 --> 00:35:00,676
Awesome?

712
00:35:00,708 --> 00:35:03,178
Yeah, I think the word
you're after is awful.

713
00:35:03,212 --> 00:35:05,480
And that's me restraining myself.

714
00:35:05,513 --> 00:35:07,216
There's not an ounce of talent
between 'em.

715
00:35:07,248 --> 00:35:09,150
Not an ounce.
In fact, you know what?

716
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:11,752
I think that prize
is as good as mine already.

717
00:35:16,424 --> 00:35:18,227
Yes, indeed,
I am about to come

718
00:35:18,259 --> 00:35:20,628
into a very,
very large sum of money.

719
00:35:20,661 --> 00:35:23,164
$100,000 to be precise.

720
00:35:23,198 --> 00:35:24,832
Well, is that so?

721
00:35:24,865 --> 00:35:27,668
In that case, sir, you'll be
wanting our platinum card.

722
00:35:33,342 --> 00:35:35,776
<i>Gas so high,
got 'em riding on E</i>

723
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:37,778
<i>Daddy needs shoes
and kids gotta eat</i>

724
00:35:37,812 --> 00:35:40,381
<i>They can have every
last penny on me</i>

725
00:35:40,415 --> 00:35:42,217
<i>Me and Swizzy rollin'
in the Lambo</i>

726
00:35:42,251 --> 00:35:44,752
<i>Sit back reminiscing
when I never had no</i>

727
00:35:44,785 --> 00:35:47,822
<i>I think I might give away
a million bucks...</i>

728
00:35:47,855 --> 00:35:49,890
Well, well, well, hello again.

729
00:35:49,924 --> 00:35:51,959
<i>'Cause I feel good,
yeah, I feel good</i>

730
00:35:51,993 --> 00:35:53,394
<i>'Cause I feel good</i>

731
00:35:54,862 --> 00:35:56,231
<i>I think I might take...</i>

732
00:35:57,432 --> 00:35:58,799
Oh, man, these are like

733
00:35:58,833 --> 00:36:00,501
the cheesiest songs of all time.

734
00:36:00,535 --> 00:36:02,303
I know, right?

735
00:36:02,337 --> 00:36:05,206
I mean, I was even thinking
of writing my own song instead.

736
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,607
Wait, what?

737
00:36:06,642 --> 00:36:09,610
- Your own song?
- Well, yeah.

738
00:36:09,645 --> 00:36:11,446
Look, if you want to win that money,

739
00:36:11,479 --> 00:36:13,548
just do what the koala says.

740
00:36:13,581 --> 00:36:15,616
Why? You think I can't
write my own song?

741
00:36:16,068 --> 00:36:17,618
I'm just saying,

742
00:36:17,653 --> 00:36:20,355
not everyone can write
songs, okay?

743
00:36:20,389 --> 00:36:22,623
I know I make it look
easy, babe,

744
00:36:22,658 --> 00:36:24,525
but it's not.

745
00:36:28,696 --> 00:36:31,266
Oh, here she is.

746
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:34,835
Quiet down, everybody.

747
00:36:34,869 --> 00:36:37,805
So, Meena, are you in the show?

748
00:36:39,483 --> 00:36:41,310
Well, yeah, kind of, but...

749
00:36:43,412 --> 00:36:44,645
She did it!

750
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:48,015
Oh, I'm so proud of you,
I could pop!

751
00:36:48,049 --> 00:36:50,285
That's my birthday wish
coming true right there!

752
00:36:50,319 --> 00:36:52,520
- Way to go, Meena!
- Oh, Meena, we love you!

753
00:36:52,553 --> 00:36:53,888
Mom...

754
00:36:53,921 --> 00:36:55,691
- What the heck?
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

755
00:36:55,723 --> 00:36:57,658
Don't be mad, okay?
It was your grandma.

756
00:36:57,693 --> 00:36:59,594
She told the whole street
about your audition.

757
00:36:59,627 --> 00:37:01,729
- Mom, no, wait.
- Shush, baby.

758
00:37:01,762 --> 00:37:04,265
You need to save
that singing voice of yours.

759
00:37:04,299 --> 00:37:05,733
So, from now on,

760
00:37:05,766 --> 00:37:09,537
just nod or shake
your head, okay?

761
00:37:18,613 --> 00:37:20,014
How was that, Dad?

762
00:37:20,047 --> 00:37:21,849
You're still too soft
on them corners, Johnny.

763
00:37:21,882 --> 00:37:23,452
You got to attack 'em.

764
00:37:23,484 --> 00:37:24,952
And you're crunching the gears.

765
00:37:24,985 --> 00:37:27,322
I told you, you got
to be gentle with the...

766
00:37:27,356 --> 00:37:29,324
Look, turn that down.

767
00:37:29,358 --> 00:37:30,591
Oi!

768
00:37:30,625 --> 00:37:32,893
Listen to your father!

769
00:37:32,927 --> 00:37:34,830
Too soft on the corners, Johnny.

770
00:37:36,497 --> 00:37:38,333
You're not doing it right, Johnny.

771
00:37:38,367 --> 00:37:39,534
Speed up, Johnny.

772
00:37:41,802 --> 00:37:43,538
Do it like I showed you.

773
00:37:46,407 --> 00:37:48,609
<i>I know exactly who you...</i>

774
00:37:52,113 --> 00:37:53,448
Dad?

775
00:37:53,482 --> 00:37:56,817
Oh, no.
I've run over my dad.

776
00:37:57,885 --> 00:37:59,520
Now, that is more like it.

777
00:38:14,369 --> 00:38:16,337
And the three little pigs

778
00:38:16,371 --> 00:38:18,973
lived happily ever after.

779
00:38:19,006 --> 00:38:20,841
Good night, my dears.

780
00:38:26,714 --> 00:38:29,350
Norman, are you awake?

781
00:38:30,918 --> 00:38:32,753
How was your day, honey?

782
00:38:32,788 --> 00:38:35,690
Same as always.

783
00:38:35,723 --> 00:38:37,948
It was?

784
00:38:38,493 --> 00:38:42,062
I don't know how you
do it all, honey.

785
00:38:42,096 --> 00:38:44,932
- Good night.
- Good night.

786
00:39:01,582 --> 00:39:04,820
All creatures great and small,

787
00:39:04,852 --> 00:39:07,422
welcome to the Moon Theater!

788
00:39:17,466 --> 00:39:19,066
Mr. Moon?

789
00:39:19,099 --> 00:39:22,102
- I have Judith from the bank.
- What?

790
00:39:22,136 --> 00:39:24,539
Whoa, no, no, no. Tell her I'll
call her back in the morning.

791
00:39:24,573 --> 00:39:26,140
Oh, I can't.

792
00:39:26,173 --> 00:39:28,008
She's right here.

793
00:39:30,479 --> 00:39:33,180
Judith! Hello.

794
00:39:33,214 --> 00:39:35,951
I work for a bank, not a charity,

795
00:39:35,983 --> 00:39:37,718
and if your accounts are not settled

796
00:39:37,752 --> 00:39:39,620
- by the end of the month...
- Okay, Judith...

797
00:39:39,654 --> 00:39:41,722
I personally guarantee,
by the end of this month,

798
00:39:41,756 --> 00:39:43,057
this show is going to be

799
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:45,192
the biggest hit this city
has ever seen.

800
00:39:45,226 --> 00:39:47,528
Mr. Moon, none of your shows
have ever worked.

801
00:39:47,562 --> 00:39:48,629
None of them!

802
00:39:48,663 --> 00:39:50,130
You've had your chances.

803
00:39:50,164 --> 00:39:51,699
Now, settle your accounts,

804
00:39:51,732 --> 00:39:54,535
or we will repossess this property.

805
00:39:54,569 --> 00:39:56,437
Okay. Toodle-oo.

806
00:39:59,608 --> 00:40:02,076
What are you going to do,
Mr. Moon?

807
00:40:02,109 --> 00:40:04,479
Honestly...

808
00:40:04,513 --> 00:40:06,146
I have no idea.

809
00:40:14,655 --> 00:40:19,528
<i>I listen to the wind,
to the wind of my soul</i>

810
00:40:22,797 --> 00:40:24,932
<i>Where I'll end up,
well, I think</i>

811
00:40:24,965 --> 00:40:27,668
<i>Only God really knows</i>

812
00:40:31,772 --> 00:40:33,741
<i>I've sat upon the...</i>

813
00:40:34,817 --> 00:40:36,611
Are you wearing a Speedo, Eddie?

814
00:40:36,645 --> 00:40:38,013
What... What are you...?

815
00:40:38,045 --> 00:40:40,114
Eddie?
Is everything all right?

816
00:40:40,147 --> 00:40:42,817
Yeah, just doing my laps, Ma!

817
00:40:44,653 --> 00:40:47,254
So, what, you live
in the pool house now?

818
00:40:47,288 --> 00:40:49,925
Yeah, my folks want me to be more,

819
00:40:49,957 --> 00:40:52,627
you know, independent, I guess.

820
00:40:52,661 --> 00:40:54,995
They even hooked me up
with this life coach dude.

821
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:56,997
- Life coach?
- Yeah.

822
00:40:57,032 --> 00:40:59,668
I guess he's gonna help me
find my purpose in life.

823
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:02,603
I thought I had one,
but it turns out

824
00:41:02,637 --> 00:41:04,238
it wasn't the right one
or something.

825
00:41:04,271 --> 00:41:06,006
I don't know.

826
00:41:06,041 --> 00:41:08,743
Anyway, he's got me
on this whole schedule thing.

827
00:41:08,776 --> 00:41:10,611
It's, like, Mondays,
take out the recycling.

828
00:41:10,645 --> 00:41:13,013
Tuesdays, mow the lawn.
Wednesdays, go visit Nana.

829
00:41:13,048 --> 00:41:14,815
Thursdays, clean the pool.

830
00:41:14,849 --> 00:41:16,717
It's like, don't we have people
to do all of this stuff?

831
00:41:17,794 --> 00:41:18,553
Back up.

832
00:41:18,587 --> 00:41:20,220
Your nana is still alive?

833
00:41:20,254 --> 00:41:21,590
Oh, yeah.

834
00:41:27,562 --> 00:41:28,929
And she's rich, right?

835
00:41:28,964 --> 00:41:30,665
She's loaded.

836
00:41:30,699 --> 00:41:33,668
But trust me, you don't want
to go near my nana.

837
00:41:35,002 --> 00:41:36,571
She is one mean sheep.

838
00:41:38,607 --> 00:41:42,242
<i>There may be trouble ahead</i>

839
00:41:43,678 --> 00:41:45,580
<i>But while there's moonlight</i>

840
00:41:45,614 --> 00:41:50,585
<i>And music and love and romance</i>

841
00:41:50,619 --> 00:41:53,253
- Now, fade up the spot.
<i>- Let's face the music</i>

842
00:41:53,287 --> 00:41:55,790
<i>And dance</i>

843
00:41:55,823 --> 00:41:57,257
Good. Lower the moon.

844
00:41:57,291 --> 00:41:59,126
- Coffee?
- Thank you, Miss Crawly.

845
00:42:00,761 --> 00:42:02,029
Okay, that's normal.

846
00:42:02,062 --> 00:42:04,031
Just needs a knock.

847
00:42:04,064 --> 00:42:06,601
See? You're getting it.

848
00:42:06,635 --> 00:42:09,136
<i>And while we've still</i>

849
00:42:09,169 --> 00:42:11,839
<i>Got a chance...</i>

850
00:42:11,872 --> 00:42:14,074
Anyone seen my glass eye?

851
00:42:14,109 --> 00:42:16,343
The darn thing keeps popping out.

852
00:42:18,045 --> 00:42:20,180
<i>Soon...</i>

853
00:42:27,321 --> 00:42:28,956
You almost killed me, Jumbo!

854
00:42:28,989 --> 00:42:31,026
- It wasn't me.
- Oh, is that so?

855
00:42:34,294 --> 00:42:36,296
Pete?

856
00:42:38,708 --> 00:42:39,768
Pete!

857
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,770
You're gonna be all right.
Okay, just...

858
00:42:41,802 --> 00:42:45,005
Just hang in there, buddy.

859
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,642
Ricki? Kai?

860
00:42:47,676 --> 00:42:48,843
Why aren't you guys rehearsing?

861
00:42:48,876 --> 00:42:50,244
We're through.

862
00:42:50,277 --> 00:42:53,180
They said
I'm an intolerable egomaniac.

863
00:42:53,213 --> 00:42:56,151
I don't even know
what that means.

864
00:42:57,686 --> 00:42:59,688
All right.
We're two acts down.

865
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,756
Give me some good news,
Miss Crawly.

866
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:05,626
Oh, it's not as bad
as it looks.

867
00:43:06,827 --> 00:43:08,663
Oopsie-daisy.

868
00:43:08,697 --> 00:43:10,799
Meena, how would you like
to re-audition for the show?

869
00:43:10,831 --> 00:43:13,233
Really? Well, yeah.

870
00:43:13,267 --> 00:43:14,301
- Great.
- I mean, no.

871
00:43:14,334 --> 00:43:15,704
What?

872
00:43:15,736 --> 00:43:17,337
I mean, yes, I can sing.

873
00:43:17,371 --> 00:43:21,141
But no, I get so nervous,
and I can't do it.

874
00:43:21,176 --> 00:43:25,080
I mean, I would totally do it,
but... no, I... no.

875
00:43:25,112 --> 00:43:27,014
I'm gonna take that as a maybe.

876
00:43:29,316 --> 00:43:30,851
Great! Look, they're back.

877
00:43:30,885 --> 00:43:32,721
We're gonna come back
to this, Meena.

878
00:43:34,089 --> 00:43:36,891
Listen, guys,
forget what I said before.

879
00:43:36,924 --> 00:43:38,793
You are very talented.

880
00:43:38,827 --> 00:43:40,961
Please, join the show, okay?

881
00:43:40,995 --> 00:43:43,030
Yes? No?

882
00:43:45,149 --> 00:43:46,066
Here.

883
00:43:56,410 --> 00:43:58,713
What? Hey, no, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

884
00:43:58,747 --> 00:44:00,014
Don't go, don't go!

885
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:04,819
Oh, what is this for?

886
00:44:04,853 --> 00:44:08,088
Now, we use this
to follow the steps.

887
00:44:08,123 --> 00:44:10,190
<i>Goddess on a mountaintop</i>

888
00:44:11,792 --> 00:44:14,929
<i>Burnin' like a silver flame</i>

889
00:44:14,962 --> 00:44:18,065
<i>The summit of beauty and love</i>

890
00:44:19,266 --> 00:44:20,300
<i>And...</i>

891
00:44:20,334 --> 00:44:21,702
Caspar! Caspar, no!

892
00:44:21,736 --> 00:44:23,170
How about this?

893
00:44:23,203 --> 00:44:24,705
Come on. What did I tell you?

894
00:44:24,739 --> 00:44:26,073
I'm so sorry.
He had a fever,

895
00:44:26,106 --> 00:44:27,708
and it was too late
to get a sitter, so...

896
00:44:27,742 --> 00:44:29,376
Well, you seem fine now.

897
00:44:30,477 --> 00:44:32,379
<i>Well, I'm your Venus</i>

898
00:44:32,412 --> 00:44:34,314
- Stop! You're messing it up!
<i>- I'm your fire</i>

899
00:44:34,348 --> 00:44:36,151
<i>- At your desire.</i>
- Hey!

900
00:44:36,183 --> 00:44:39,353
I am not singing this.

901
00:44:39,386 --> 00:44:40,921
What's not to like?

902
00:44:40,955 --> 00:44:42,356
You're a female,
and you're a teenager.

903
00:44:42,389 --> 00:44:43,758
This song was made for you.

904
00:44:43,792 --> 00:44:45,092
Wow, it's like you can

905
00:44:45,125 --> 00:44:47,162
see inside my tiny
teenage mind.

906
00:44:47,194 --> 00:44:49,264
I know, right?
You just gotta add some moves

907
00:44:49,296 --> 00:44:51,131
and a little bit of...

908
00:44:51,166 --> 00:44:53,168
<i>Hey, I just met you</i>

909
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,369
<i>And this is crazy</i>

910
00:44:55,402 --> 00:44:57,272
<i>But here's my number</i>

911
00:44:57,304 --> 00:44:59,206
<i>So call me maybe</i>

912
00:44:59,239 --> 00:45:01,441
- Go for it!
- Oh, you mean like this?

913
00:45:01,475 --> 00:45:03,410
<i>Try to chase me</i>

914
00:45:03,443 --> 00:45:05,345
<i>But here's my number</i>

915
00:45:05,379 --> 00:45:07,282
<i>So call me maybe.</i>

916
00:45:07,314 --> 00:45:09,516
There you go.
You're a natural.

917
00:45:15,856 --> 00:45:17,792
Yes, that was very bad.

918
00:45:17,826 --> 00:45:19,326
Johnny.

919
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:21,095
Come in. Over.

920
00:45:21,128 --> 00:45:22,529
Oh, Johnny, your jacket's talking.

921
00:45:22,563 --> 00:45:24,398
Johnny, where are you?

922
00:45:24,431 --> 00:45:26,400
Dad, what's going on? Over.

923
00:45:26,433 --> 00:45:28,435
What do you mean,
you gotta leave now?

924
00:45:28,468 --> 00:45:30,237
I know.
I'm... I'm so sorry.

925
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:31,972
It's just, I've got
this family business thing.

926
00:45:32,006 --> 00:45:33,173
Do I need to start worrying

927
00:45:33,208 --> 00:45:34,374
about your commitment
here, Johnny?

928
00:45:34,408 --> 00:45:35,776
- Tell me no.
- No. Absolutely not.

929
00:45:35,810 --> 00:45:37,177
I promise it won't
happen again.

930
00:45:37,212 --> 00:45:39,246
- It better not.
- Thank you, Mr. Moon.

931
00:45:39,279 --> 00:45:41,448
<i>I want love to forget</i>

932
00:45:41,481 --> 00:45:43,550
<i>- That you offended me</i>
- Baby, I'm back.

933
00:45:43,584 --> 00:45:45,986
<i>Or how you had defended me</i>

934
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:48,789
<i>When everybody tore me down</i>

935
00:45:48,823 --> 00:45:52,927
<i>Yeah, I want love to change
my friends to enemies</i>

936
00:45:52,961 --> 00:45:55,362
<i>- Change my...</i>
- What is going on here?

937
00:45:56,965 --> 00:45:59,399
Hi. I'm Becky.

938
00:45:59,433 --> 00:46:01,268
Becky?

939
00:46:01,301 --> 00:46:02,502
Hey, what did you expect?

940
00:46:02,536 --> 00:46:04,071
You're never around anymore.

941
00:46:04,104 --> 00:46:06,540
I did it for us, Lance!

942
00:46:06,573 --> 00:46:07,908
You and me!

943
00:46:08,977 --> 00:46:10,444
Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.

944
00:46:10,477 --> 00:46:13,047
I think I left my sunglasses
in there.

945
00:46:15,115 --> 00:46:16,351
Come on, Becky.

946
00:46:16,383 --> 00:46:17,918
Let's get out of here.

947
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:33,300
Jackpot, baby!

948
00:46:34,935 --> 00:46:37,204
Well, I say we call it
a night there, fellas.

949
00:46:37,237 --> 00:46:39,473
Hey, put the cash in my car,
will you, Derek?

950
00:46:41,575 --> 00:46:44,845
Well, you're one great
card player, Mike.

951
00:46:44,879 --> 00:46:47,173
Not so bad yourself.

952
00:46:47,414 --> 00:46:50,417
Except I still can't tell
how you cheated.

953
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:52,287
Cheated? Cheated?

954
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:54,389
Oh, I am offended.

955
00:46:54,421 --> 00:46:56,223
Come on, baby,
let's cut some rug.

956
00:46:59,928 --> 00:47:01,528
What the...?

957
00:47:02,663 --> 00:47:04,899
How did that get there?

958
00:47:04,933 --> 00:47:06,200
- Run for it, baby!
- Hey!

959
00:47:08,335 --> 00:47:10,104
Get him!

960
00:47:18,578 --> 00:47:20,614
Excuse me.

961
00:47:20,647 --> 00:47:23,984
Don't let him get away!

962
00:47:29,356 --> 00:47:31,025
- Thanks, Derek.
- Out of the way.

963
00:47:39,934 --> 00:47:41,301
So long, suckers!

964
00:47:52,546 --> 00:47:54,114
Good morning, Buster.

965
00:47:54,148 --> 00:47:55,950
- Hey, Eddie. How are you?
- Good.

966
00:47:55,984 --> 00:47:58,152
- How's the show going?
- Ah, it's going great.

967
00:47:58,185 --> 00:48:00,254
Hey, that's a sharp jacket
you've got on today.

968
00:48:00,287 --> 00:48:01,555
Oh, thanks.

969
00:48:01,588 --> 00:48:04,024
Wait.

970
00:48:04,058 --> 00:48:05,425
What are you doing here?

971
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:07,394
Eddie, you can't come
visit your nana

972
00:48:07,427 --> 00:48:09,063
without bringing her
some flowers.

973
00:48:09,097 --> 00:48:10,564
- Here.
- What? No!

974
00:48:10,597 --> 00:48:12,566
Buster, no! Don't go in there!

975
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:14,068
Yes, can I help...?

976
00:48:14,102 --> 00:48:16,703
- Buster!
- Ah, Nana!

977
00:48:20,975 --> 00:48:22,209
Just look at you, dear.

978
00:48:23,343 --> 00:48:25,380
You don't look a day over 90.

979
00:48:25,412 --> 00:48:26,613
Oh, my gosh.

980
00:48:26,646 --> 00:48:27,982
Buster Moon.

981
00:48:28,016 --> 00:48:29,649
We met at Eddie's graduation.

982
00:48:29,683 --> 00:48:31,386
Oh, lucky me.

983
00:48:31,418 --> 00:48:33,587
A visit from my useless grandson

984
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:36,290
and his ghastly little
theater friend.

985
00:48:36,323 --> 00:48:37,724
Look at that,
she remembers me.

986
00:48:37,758 --> 00:48:39,226
Okay, Nana...

987
00:48:39,259 --> 00:48:41,328
How would you like to be
the sponsor

988
00:48:41,361 --> 00:48:43,131
for a very prestigious prize?

989
00:48:43,163 --> 00:48:45,732
Not for that singing contest
I saw on the news.

990
00:48:45,766 --> 00:48:47,334
That's the one.

991
00:48:47,367 --> 00:48:49,203
Oh, I see.

992
00:48:49,236 --> 00:48:52,006
You don't have the money, do you?

993
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:53,740
Well, we don't quite have it
all locked in...

994
00:48:53,774 --> 00:48:55,175
Well, you'll not get a cent
out of me.

995
00:48:55,209 --> 00:48:56,543
Nana, please, just listen to me

996
00:48:56,576 --> 00:48:58,345
- for one second, okay?
- No, absolutely not.

997
00:48:58,378 --> 00:48:59,679
- Don't listen to him, Nana.
- I'm not listening

998
00:48:59,713 --> 00:49:01,381
- to either of you.
- Just wait one second.

999
00:49:01,416 --> 00:49:03,418
Lapsang souchong, no sugar,
and be quick about it.

1000
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:07,021
Nana, I don't know
how to make tea.

1001
00:49:09,474 --> 00:49:11,992
I saw this show
when I was a kid.

1002
00:49:12,026 --> 00:49:14,494
Nana, you were absolutely
amazing.

1003
00:49:14,529 --> 00:49:16,763
Please, this flattery is futile.

1004
00:49:16,797 --> 00:49:19,299
I have no intention
of bailing you out.

1005
00:49:19,333 --> 00:49:21,635
Your pathetic shows
are the reason

1006
00:49:21,668 --> 00:49:23,370
that theater no longer
has an audience.

1007
00:49:23,403 --> 00:49:25,372
Oh, but this show is gonna...
gonna pack 'em in

1008
00:49:25,405 --> 00:49:27,075
like it did in the
good old days.

1009
00:49:27,107 --> 00:49:30,244
They were not good old days,
Mr. Moon.

1010
00:49:30,277 --> 00:49:33,213
They were magnificent.

1011
00:49:33,247 --> 00:49:35,282
And that theater of yours,

1012
00:49:35,315 --> 00:49:39,153
it was a palace of wonder
and magic.

1013
00:49:39,187 --> 00:49:40,487
But, Nana, it still is.

1014
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,289
Yeah, right.

1015
00:49:42,322 --> 00:49:46,094
I can recall the ushers
in their velvet suits.

1016
00:49:46,126 --> 00:49:49,396
Queues a mile long just
to get a ticket.

1017
00:49:49,429 --> 00:49:54,102
The curtain rising
over that glorious stage.

1018
00:49:54,134 --> 00:49:58,072
Music and light bringing
dreams to life?

1019
00:49:58,106 --> 00:49:59,406
Precisely.

1020
00:49:59,439 --> 00:50:01,576
Well, it's just like
you remember it.

1021
00:50:01,608 --> 00:50:04,411
In fact, I've made it
even more spectacular.

1022
00:50:04,444 --> 00:50:05,679
No, you haven't.

1023
00:50:05,712 --> 00:50:07,215
Come see for yourself.

1024
00:50:07,247 --> 00:50:08,782
A special performance
just for you.

1025
00:50:08,815 --> 00:50:10,417
What do you say, Nana?

1026
00:50:10,450 --> 00:50:12,252
I say...

1027
00:50:12,286 --> 00:50:13,720
you are a liar, Mr. Moon.

1028
00:50:13,753 --> 00:50:17,125
Okay, well, we're done now.
Thank you, Nana.

1029
00:50:17,157 --> 00:50:19,293
But anything's better
than spending another evening

1030
00:50:19,326 --> 00:50:21,361
playing checkers with
this old fart.

1031
00:50:21,395 --> 00:50:22,462
What?

1032
00:50:22,497 --> 00:50:23,530
Great.

1033
00:50:23,563 --> 00:50:25,065
It's gonna blow you away, Nana.

1034
00:50:25,099 --> 00:50:26,766
And that is no lie.

1035
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,603
Now, listen up.

1036
00:50:28,635 --> 00:50:31,305
Tomorrow we are going to have
a full preview of the show,

1037
00:50:31,338 --> 00:50:34,741
and our audience will be none
other than Miss Nana Noodleman.

1038
00:50:34,774 --> 00:50:36,110
- Nana Noodleman?
- Wow, Nana Noodleman.

1039
00:50:36,144 --> 00:50:37,311
She's still alive?

1040
00:50:37,344 --> 00:50:39,079
Oh, yes, and believe me,

1041
00:50:39,113 --> 00:50:41,215
she's got some pretty
high standards.

1042
00:50:41,249 --> 00:50:42,749
All right? So, today,
we're going to have

1043
00:50:42,782 --> 00:50:44,851
a full dress rehearsal,
and I want to see you

1044
00:50:44,885 --> 00:50:46,586
light up the stage, folks.

1045
00:50:46,621 --> 00:50:48,523
- Well, that's cool.
- Meena? Miss Crawly?

1046
00:50:48,555 --> 00:50:49,823
What do you think?

1047
00:50:49,856 --> 00:50:51,858
Wow, it's so ambitious.

1048
00:50:51,892 --> 00:50:53,293
Yeah, are you sure about this?

1049
00:50:53,327 --> 00:50:55,495
I promised Nana
something spectacular.

1050
00:50:55,530 --> 00:50:58,098
And this...
It's gonna blow her away.

1051
00:50:58,132 --> 00:51:00,300
- Oh, yes.
- Two minutes, everybody.

1052
00:51:00,334 --> 00:51:02,202
Johnny.

1053
00:51:02,236 --> 00:51:03,703
Johnny, where are you?

1054
00:51:05,439 --> 00:51:07,607
Johnny,
answer the walkie-talkie.

1055
00:51:07,642 --> 00:51:09,509
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Dad.
I'm here. I'm here.

1056
00:51:09,544 --> 00:51:11,111
- What's wrong?
- We got the call.

1057
00:51:11,145 --> 00:51:12,412
Shipment's coming in.

1058
00:51:12,446 --> 00:51:15,149
- Tonight?
- Not tonight. Now.

1059
00:51:15,183 --> 00:51:17,784
Meet us on the corner
of Hector Street in two minutes.

1060
00:51:29,396 --> 00:51:30,797
Stay here.

1061
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:32,667
We'll be back in exactly 37...

1062
00:51:32,699 --> 00:51:34,268
Yeah, 37 minutes. Yep.

1063
00:51:34,302 --> 00:51:36,370
You've told me repeatedly.

1064
00:51:42,542 --> 00:51:43,810
I can make it.

1065
00:51:49,317 --> 00:51:50,384
Bravo, Mike.

1066
00:51:50,417 --> 00:51:51,918
Nana is gonna love that.

1067
00:51:51,952 --> 00:51:54,188
Oh, you're...
you're too kind, Mr. Moon.

1068
00:51:54,222 --> 00:51:56,290
And I myself am loving
the new suit, sir.

1069
00:51:56,324 --> 00:51:59,159
Okay, can we see Ash
next, please?

1070
00:51:59,193 --> 00:52:01,161
Ash, let's get you out here.

1071
00:52:02,262 --> 00:52:03,463
Oh, stand back.

1072
00:52:03,497 --> 00:52:05,199
Moody teenager coming through.

1073
00:52:05,233 --> 00:52:06,400
Good luck, Ash.

1074
00:52:14,474 --> 00:52:16,344
<i>I threw a wish in the well</i>

1075
00:52:16,376 --> 00:52:18,278
<i>Don't ask me, I'll never tell</i>

1076
00:52:18,312 --> 00:52:20,580
<i>I looked to you as it fell</i>

1077
00:52:20,615 --> 00:52:22,382
<i>And now you're in my way</i>

1078
00:52:22,416 --> 00:52:24,218
<i>Your stare was holding</i>

1079
00:52:24,252 --> 00:52:25,919
<i>Ripped jeans, skin was showing</i>

1080
00:52:25,952 --> 00:52:27,854
<i>Hot night, wind was blowing</i>

1081
00:52:27,887 --> 00:52:30,690
<i>Where do you think
you're going, baby?</i>

1082
00:52:30,725 --> 00:52:32,826
<i>I just met you</i>

1083
00:52:32,859 --> 00:52:35,495
<i>This is crazy</i>

1084
00:52:35,529 --> 00:52:38,565
<i>Here's my number,
so call me maybe...</i>

1085
00:52:39,641 --> 00:52:40,800
Okay, enough of that.

1086
00:52:40,834 --> 00:52:43,470
Cut it, cut it, cut it, cut it.

1087
00:52:43,503 --> 00:52:44,871
I don't think anyone's

1088
00:52:44,904 --> 00:52:46,306
gonna call her after that.

1089
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:48,242
Okay, Ash...

1090
00:52:48,276 --> 00:52:50,877
Hey, come on, Ash.

1091
00:52:50,910 --> 00:52:52,912
What is it? Do you...
Do you not like the dress?

1092
00:52:57,417 --> 00:52:58,718
Ash, what's wrong?

1093
00:53:05,992 --> 00:53:07,762
Well, it sounds to me like you

1094
00:53:07,794 --> 00:53:10,497
are way better off
without that... that...

1095
00:53:10,530 --> 00:53:12,999
That total super-jerk
dinkleschplatt!

1096
00:53:13,033 --> 00:53:16,671
Exactly.
Total super-jerk dinkleschplatt.

1097
00:53:16,703 --> 00:53:17,937
Rosita! Gunter!

1098
00:53:17,971 --> 00:53:19,774
- You're on next.
- Yeah, okay, here.

1099
00:53:19,806 --> 00:53:21,608
There should be some gum or
some candy in there somewhere.

1100
00:53:21,641 --> 00:53:22,642
Just help yourself.

1101
00:53:22,677 --> 00:53:23,910
Rosita, Rosita, Rosita.

1102
00:53:23,943 --> 00:53:25,780
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

1103
00:53:25,812 --> 00:53:27,415
Can I take your place, please?

1104
00:53:27,447 --> 00:53:28,915
- Sure, Johnny. Go ahead.
- Okay, get ready,

1105
00:53:28,948 --> 00:53:31,419
'cause I'm warning you...

1106
00:53:31,451 --> 00:53:35,655
this stage is about to explode
with major piggy power.

1107
00:53:35,690 --> 00:53:37,291
I am so sorry.

1108
00:53:37,325 --> 00:53:39,025
I have no control.

1109
00:53:41,995 --> 00:53:43,630
Yeah!

1110
00:53:43,663 --> 00:53:45,632
Okay, come on, you can do this.

1111
00:53:45,665 --> 00:53:48,336
<i>I stay out too late</i>

1112
00:53:48,368 --> 00:53:50,438
<i>Got nothing in my brain...</i>

1113
00:53:52,372 --> 00:53:53,540
Are you okay?

1114
00:53:53,573 --> 00:53:55,742
Oh, yes, I'm fine, thank you.

1115
00:53:55,775 --> 00:53:57,611
- How are you?
- Okay.

1116
00:53:57,644 --> 00:53:59,814
Johnny, let's get you out here!

1117
00:53:59,846 --> 00:54:02,382
And, you guys, you've gotta
work on that routine.

1118
00:54:02,416 --> 00:54:04,651
Take it away, Johnny!

1119
00:54:04,684 --> 00:54:08,988
<i>What would I do
without your smart mouth</i>

1120
00:54:09,022 --> 00:54:12,592
<i>Drawing me in
and you kicking me out</i>

1121
00:54:12,626 --> 00:54:15,862
<i>You got my head spinning...</i>

1122
00:54:15,895 --> 00:54:17,564
You can't just sing it.

1123
00:54:17,597 --> 00:54:19,566
You've got to show
the fire und desire.

1124
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:21,469
The fire went out
a long time ago.

1125
00:54:21,501 --> 00:54:22,837
What?

1126
00:54:22,869 --> 00:54:25,572
Look, I can't even
keep count of the steps.

1127
00:54:25,605 --> 00:54:27,475
Counting schmounting!

1128
00:54:27,507 --> 00:54:30,710
She sings too much
with her head, right?

1129
00:54:30,745 --> 00:54:32,412
Ja, ja, see?

1130
00:54:32,446 --> 00:54:34,648
Forget the steps
and just, like,

1131
00:54:34,681 --> 00:54:37,385
let the music take control
of your body parts.

1132
00:54:37,417 --> 00:54:39,387
My body parts are not
responding, okay?

1133
00:54:39,419 --> 00:54:41,087
It's never gonna happen.

1134
00:54:41,121 --> 00:54:43,323
I should just be getting groceries.

1135
00:54:43,357 --> 00:54:45,325
- Rosita, no. - Rosita, come on.
- What? Rosita, please.

1136
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:46,926
Like, don't go.

1137
00:54:48,562 --> 00:54:50,664
Psst! Hey! Hey!

1138
00:54:50,697 --> 00:54:52,366
Down here.

1139
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,801
Have you seen three
nasty-looking bears out there?

1140
00:54:55,877 --> 00:54:56,703
No.

1141
00:54:56,736 --> 00:54:59,373
Oh, great. Hey, by the way,
I love your act.

1142
00:54:59,407 --> 00:55:01,876
Seriously, the part where you fall
flat on your face?

1143
00:55:01,908 --> 00:55:04,611
Oh, that...
that cracks me up, every time.

1144
00:55:04,644 --> 00:55:06,446
See you around, Porky.

1145
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,348
<i>And you give me</i>

1146
00:55:08,382 --> 00:55:12,852
<i>All of you</i>

1147
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:16,891
Ah, man.

1148
00:55:16,923 --> 00:55:19,359
Johnny, I know
I'm asking a lot of you...

1149
00:55:19,393 --> 00:55:21,361
Mr. Moon, I'm really trying,
I promise.

1150
00:55:21,395 --> 00:55:22,662
What about your backup song?

1151
00:55:22,696 --> 00:55:23,930
Have you practiced that?

1152
00:55:24,589 --> 00:55:25,800
Well, not yet.

1153
00:55:25,832 --> 00:55:28,835
Well, why don't we go back
and work on that one, okay?

1154
00:55:28,868 --> 00:55:31,037
I mean, look,
if you play like that

1155
00:55:31,070 --> 00:55:34,140
in front of Nana Noodleman...

1156
00:55:34,174 --> 00:55:36,109
Johnny?

1157
00:55:43,918 --> 00:55:45,553
Hey!

1158
00:56:04,037 --> 00:56:06,673
We are set for life now, boys!

1159
00:56:08,074 --> 00:56:10,444
What's going on?
Where's Johnny?

1160
00:56:10,478 --> 00:56:11,711
He's not here.

1161
00:56:14,714 --> 00:56:16,916
Run!

1162
00:56:28,094 --> 00:56:30,163
Oh, I'm dead.

1163
00:56:31,665 --> 00:56:33,467
<i>Finally see</i>

1164
00:56:33,501 --> 00:56:36,102
<i>It's not just a dream</i>

1165
00:56:36,135 --> 00:56:38,705
<i>When you set it all</i>

1166
00:56:38,738 --> 00:56:41,675
<i>Free, free...</i>

1167
00:56:41,708 --> 00:56:43,710
Okay, wait, let me see.

1168
00:56:45,513 --> 00:56:49,849
<i>When you set it all free,
all free, all free...</i>

1169
00:56:51,785 --> 00:56:53,687
No, Mom, I have not made
any friends.

1170
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:55,154
What do you think this is,
kindergarten?

1171
00:56:55,188 --> 00:56:56,624
If you hadn't squealed to the cops,

1172
00:56:56,656 --> 00:56:57,924
I wouldn't be in here right now.

1173
00:56:57,957 --> 00:56:59,493
Honey, when are you getting out?

1174
00:56:59,527 --> 00:57:01,529
I'm only gonna be in here
for a few years.

1175
00:57:01,561 --> 00:57:02,897
Well, where'd you hide the money?

1176
00:57:02,929 --> 00:57:04,532
Where were you?

1177
00:57:04,877 --> 00:57:06,232
Well, thing is, I went

1178
00:57:06,266 --> 00:57:08,735
- to get gas, and...
- Don't lie to me!

1179
00:57:09,081 --> 00:57:11,605
I was at a rehearsal.

1180
00:57:11,639 --> 00:57:13,908
Rehearsal? For what?

1181
00:57:15,108 --> 00:57:16,843
I was at a singing contest.

1182
00:57:18,512 --> 00:57:20,648
Look, Dad, I'm... I'm sorry.

1183
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:22,616
I just don't want to be
in your gang.

1184
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:24,784
- I want to be a singer.
- Singer?

1185
00:57:24,818 --> 00:57:26,185
Look, Dad, no, it's okay,
it's okay.

1186
00:57:26,219 --> 00:57:27,721
I can get the bail money.

1187
00:57:27,754 --> 00:57:29,188
There's a prize, it's $100,000.

1188
00:57:32,959 --> 00:57:36,229
How did I end up
with a son like you, eh?

1189
00:57:36,262 --> 00:57:38,498
You're nothing like me.

1190
00:57:38,532 --> 00:57:40,734
You never were,
and you never will be.

1191
00:57:40,767 --> 00:57:41,968
I'll get you out!
Dad, wait!

1192
00:57:42,001 --> 00:57:44,838
I'll get the money!
I promise!

1193
00:58:19,607 --> 00:58:21,808
Johnny! Oh!

1194
00:58:21,841 --> 00:58:24,544
You...
You gave me a fright there.

1195
00:58:24,578 --> 00:58:26,179
Sorry. I didn't mean to.
I just...

1196
00:58:26,212 --> 00:58:27,847
Well, I know it's late,

1197
00:58:27,881 --> 00:58:30,650
but I could really use
some extra piano lessons.

1198
00:58:35,589 --> 00:58:37,523
That's it.

1199
00:58:38,958 --> 00:58:40,794
That's good.

1200
00:58:40,827 --> 00:58:42,161
You're getting it.

1217
01:00:00,174 --> 01:00:02,176
that was awesome.

1218
01:00:03,943 --> 01:00:06,946
All right.

1219
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:10,249
Mr. Moon,
are you sure this is legal?

1220
01:00:11,013 --> 01:00:12,086
I don't know.

1221
01:00:12,118 --> 01:00:13,887
All right, but if you keep
asking questions,

1222
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,755
we'll never get this done.

1223
01:00:15,789 --> 01:00:16,923
Now, hit it!

1224
01:00:22,161 --> 01:00:23,963
A little higher.

1225
01:00:23,997 --> 01:00:25,264
Just a little bit.

1226
01:00:25,298 --> 01:00:27,801
There it is. Thank you.

1227
01:00:46,352 --> 01:00:47,453
Hey!

1228
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:48,856
Posters up.

1229
01:00:48,888 --> 01:00:51,190
- You!
- Now, run away!

1230
01:00:51,225 --> 01:00:53,861
Come back here, you vandals!

1231
01:01:10,443 --> 01:01:12,045
Rosita, have you seen my car?

1232
01:01:16,750 --> 01:01:18,886
Rosita, what the...?

1233
01:01:18,918 --> 01:01:20,888
What's going on?

1234
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:22,421
Rosita!

1235
01:01:27,493 --> 01:01:29,462
Kids, where's Mommy?

1236
01:01:37,436 --> 01:01:39,305
How's that, Miss Crawly?

1237
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:42,776
Hey.

1238
01:01:42,810 --> 01:01:43,911
Sorry.

1239
01:01:43,943 --> 01:01:45,211
Mr. Moon would like everyone

1240
01:01:45,244 --> 01:01:47,146
to meet backstage
before she arrives.

1241
01:01:47,181 --> 01:01:51,819
<i>When you set it all free,
all free, all free</i>

1242
01:01:51,851 --> 01:01:55,823
<i>You set it all free</i>

1243
01:01:57,557 --> 01:01:58,926
You wrote that?

1244
01:01:59,271 --> 01:02:00,359
Yeah.

1245
01:02:00,393 --> 01:02:01,895
Do you like it?

1246
01:02:01,929 --> 01:02:03,096
Are you kidding?

1247
01:02:03,129 --> 01:02:04,397
It's fantastic.

1248
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:06,800
You've gotta sing that today.

1249
01:02:06,834 --> 01:02:09,168
Mike, you're on first.

1250
01:02:09,203 --> 01:02:10,169
Sure.

1251
01:02:10,204 --> 01:02:11,270
Just a second here.

1252
01:02:11,305 --> 01:02:12,271
Honey, I'm busy.

1253
01:02:12,306 --> 01:02:13,873
What? I can't hear you.

1254
01:02:13,907 --> 01:02:16,509
Rosita and Gunter,
you're on after Mike.

1255
01:02:16,542 --> 01:02:17,811
You got it, boss.

1256
01:02:17,845 --> 01:02:19,345
Rosita!

1257
01:02:19,378 --> 01:02:20,446
Super cool!

1258
01:02:20,479 --> 01:02:22,015
You've, like, totally come back.

1259
01:02:22,048 --> 01:02:24,283
Okay, Johnny, you follow them...

1260
01:02:24,318 --> 01:02:26,820
What?
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, I'm ready.

1261
01:02:26,854 --> 01:02:28,054
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Ash, you're...

1262
01:02:28,087 --> 01:02:29,488
After Johnny. I got it.

1263
01:02:29,522 --> 01:02:31,290
And, Meena, last chance, kid.

1264
01:02:31,325 --> 01:02:33,492
You want to... You want to join
these guys out there today?

1265
01:02:33,526 --> 01:02:36,562
I would.
I just get so scared.

1266
01:02:36,596 --> 01:02:38,131
Sure, you do.
All right, but...

1267
01:02:38,164 --> 01:02:39,867
you know how to get
over that, right?

1268
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:41,500
No.

1269
01:02:41,534 --> 01:02:43,569
You just start singing.

1270
01:02:43,603 --> 01:02:45,371
Do what you love,
then you'll be great

1271
01:02:45,404 --> 01:02:46,974
'cause you won't be
afraid anymore

1272
01:02:47,006 --> 01:02:49,075
because you'll actually
be doing it, right?

1273
01:02:50,409 --> 01:02:52,880
Look, do you love to sing?

1274
01:02:52,912 --> 01:02:54,948
I mean,
do you really love it?

1275
01:02:54,982 --> 01:02:56,215
Of course I do.

1276
01:02:56,250 --> 01:02:58,084
Then you face this head-on,
Meena.

1277
01:02:58,117 --> 01:02:59,853
Because, like my dad always said,

1278
01:02:59,887 --> 01:03:03,022
don't let fear stop you
from doing the thing you love.

1279
01:03:03,369 --> 01:03:05,224
Okay, I'll do it.

1280
01:03:05,259 --> 01:03:07,361
- Great.
- Mr. Moon!

1281
01:03:07,393 --> 01:03:09,295
She's here.

1282
01:03:23,342 --> 01:03:25,544
Nana...!

1283
01:03:25,578 --> 01:03:27,546
Do not even think
of embracing me.

1284
01:03:27,580 --> 01:03:29,182
You got it.

1285
01:03:29,215 --> 01:03:31,217
Eddie, please show your Nana
to the royal box.

1286
01:03:31,250 --> 01:03:32,518
Oh, for heaven sakes,

1287
01:03:32,551 --> 01:03:35,254
I'm perfectly capable of walking.

1288
01:03:35,289 --> 01:03:36,522
You nervous?

1289
01:03:36,555 --> 01:03:38,557
Are you kidding?

1290
01:03:38,591 --> 01:03:41,295
I'm absolutely terrified.

1291
01:03:46,934 --> 01:03:48,902
Boss.
That's his car, isn't it?

1292
01:03:48,936 --> 01:03:50,069
Right there.

1293
01:03:51,570 --> 01:03:53,606
Pull over.

1294
01:03:57,576 --> 01:03:59,078
Lapsang souchong,

1295
01:03:59,112 --> 01:04:00,914
courtesy of Mr. Moo, Moo...

1296
01:04:03,582 --> 01:04:05,151
Wonderful.

1297
01:04:08,422 --> 01:04:10,156
Honey, honey, the show
is starting, all right?

1298
01:04:10,189 --> 01:04:11,959
I can't talk now.
I gotta go.

1299
01:04:11,991 --> 01:04:13,592
Of course I love you.

1300
01:04:13,626 --> 01:04:15,929
You think I'd buy you
diamond earrings if I didn't...

1301
01:04:15,963 --> 01:04:18,364
Where is my money?

1302
01:04:18,397 --> 01:04:20,399
Okay, okay, listen, listen,
I just...

1303
01:04:20,434 --> 01:04:23,070
I just maybe kind of
spent it all.

1304
01:04:23,102 --> 01:04:24,670
You know?

1305
01:04:24,704 --> 01:04:25,905
No, no, no, please, please, wait!

1306
01:04:25,939 --> 01:04:26,940
I'll give you the money.

1307
01:04:26,974 --> 01:04:27,941
I'll get you...

1308
01:04:27,975 --> 01:04:29,475
I'll get you $100,000!

1309
01:04:29,508 --> 01:04:30,910
Where are you

1310
01:04:30,944 --> 01:04:33,046
going to get that kind of money?

1311
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:34,247
Moon! Okay?

1312
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:36,115
Moon's got my money.

1313
01:04:37,550 --> 01:04:40,619
Who is this Moon?

1314
01:04:43,056 --> 01:04:45,993
All creatures great and small,

1315
01:04:46,025 --> 01:04:48,227
welcome to the Moon Theater.

1316
01:04:48,261 --> 01:04:52,099
I am your host,
Buster Moon, and...

1317
01:04:55,002 --> 01:04:56,569
Okay.

1318
01:04:56,602 --> 01:04:58,304
Behold!

1319
01:04:58,337 --> 01:05:02,041
The very first stage lit
entirely by...

1320
01:05:02,075 --> 01:05:03,276
squid power.

1321
01:05:05,012 --> 01:05:06,245
<i>Flashing</i>

1322
01:05:06,279 --> 01:05:07,981
<i>Lights, lights, lights</i>

1323
01:05:10,049 --> 01:05:11,350
<i>Flashing...</i>

1324
01:05:11,385 --> 01:05:12,486
Yeah!

1325
01:05:12,518 --> 01:05:13,619
Beautiful work, guys.

1326
01:05:13,652 --> 01:05:15,489
Now just follow me on the beat.

1327
01:05:15,521 --> 01:05:16,655
<i>Flashing</i>

1328
01:05:16,689 --> 01:05:17,991
<i>Lights, lights, lights...</i>

1329
01:05:18,025 --> 01:05:19,126
And as you can see,

1330
01:05:19,158 --> 01:05:20,994
this is no ordinary theater.

1331
01:05:21,028 --> 01:05:24,597
This is a palace of wonder and magic.

1332
01:05:24,630 --> 01:05:26,432
He's done it!

1333
01:05:26,465 --> 01:05:28,167
He's really done it, Nana!

1334
01:05:28,201 --> 01:05:30,669
Oh, goodness.

1335
01:05:30,703 --> 01:05:34,307
Now welcome our first contestant.

1336
01:05:36,709 --> 01:05:38,677
Which one of you is Moon?

1337
01:05:38,711 --> 01:05:40,980
Hey, hey, hey,
you can't just barge in here.

1338
01:05:41,014 --> 01:05:42,481
You know this guy?

1339
01:05:42,516 --> 01:05:43,983
- Mike?
- Right.

1340
01:05:44,017 --> 01:05:46,585
Mike here says you got his money

1341
01:05:46,619 --> 01:05:48,754
and it's in that box.

1342
01:05:48,788 --> 01:05:51,324
No, no, no, no, no,
just hold on a moment here.

1343
01:05:51,357 --> 01:05:53,326
That's prize money,
and it's not Mike's

1344
01:05:53,359 --> 01:05:54,660
unless he wins it fair and...

1345
01:05:54,693 --> 01:05:56,729
- Give him the money!
- Okay, okay.

1346
01:05:56,762 --> 01:05:58,664
Hey, hey, hey, hey, take it.
The whole chest.

1347
01:05:58,697 --> 01:06:00,299
It's yours, okay?
All right here.

1348
01:06:00,333 --> 01:06:01,435
Open it.

1349
01:06:01,467 --> 01:06:03,569
Open it? I... No. Me?

1350
01:06:03,602 --> 01:06:04,737
Open it!

1351
01:06:04,770 --> 01:06:06,305
Okay, no, I...

1352
01:06:06,339 --> 01:06:08,442
I just don't...
I don't have the keys,

1353
01:06:08,474 --> 01:06:10,043
so maybe you can come
back later?

1354
01:06:10,077 --> 01:06:11,577
Get out of the way!

1355
01:06:11,610 --> 01:06:13,479
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

1356
01:06:13,512 --> 01:06:15,481
Wait!

1357
01:06:20,386 --> 01:06:21,620
Hey, hey, there you go.

1358
01:06:21,654 --> 01:06:23,190
Big guy with a bat.

1359
01:06:23,222 --> 01:06:24,590
Who needs keys, right?
All right, well, let...

1360
01:06:24,623 --> 01:06:26,025
let's get this thing
squared up now.

1361
01:06:27,293 --> 01:06:28,727
What the...?

1362
01:06:28,761 --> 01:06:30,296
That's it?

1363
01:06:30,329 --> 01:06:32,998
That's all there is?

1364
01:06:34,101 --> 01:06:35,168
He lied.

1365
01:06:37,136 --> 01:06:39,206
- Moon lied to us all.
- Well, wait a second.

1366
01:06:39,238 --> 01:06:41,108
- I can explain. Okay?
- He's your problem, not me.

1367
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:42,209
This is just a prop.

1368
01:06:42,241 --> 01:06:43,742
So, where's the $100,00?

1369
01:06:43,776 --> 01:06:45,378
You're kidding.

1370
01:06:45,411 --> 01:06:46,612
What's the big idea?

1371
01:06:46,645 --> 01:06:47,613
What a huge waste of everyone's...

1372
01:06:47,646 --> 01:06:49,448
This... This was just...

1373
01:06:57,623 --> 01:06:58,657
Buster, look out!

1374
01:07:08,667 --> 01:07:11,337
I'm stuck!

1375
01:07:36,329 --> 01:07:39,132
Buster, it's falling!
Let go!

1376
01:07:56,283 --> 01:07:57,883
Hey!

1377
01:07:57,917 --> 01:07:59,785
Okay, okay, okay, steady, girl.

1378
01:07:59,818 --> 01:08:00,853
Steady...

1379
01:08:17,937 --> 01:08:21,540
No, no, no, no...!

1380
01:08:26,612 --> 01:08:28,181
Is everyone okay?

1381
01:08:28,215 --> 01:08:29,316
Nana!

1382
01:08:29,348 --> 01:08:32,185
I'm so sorry. I just...

1383
01:08:32,219 --> 01:08:34,253
No, no, no, no, no, don't...

1384
01:08:34,287 --> 01:08:35,288
Don't go!

1385
01:08:35,322 --> 01:08:38,291
Has anyone seen my glass eye?

1386
01:08:38,325 --> 01:08:40,493
Oh, it...
it's right here, Miss Crawly.

1387
01:08:40,526 --> 01:08:41,760
I've got it.

1388
01:08:47,866 --> 01:08:48,867
Look out!

1389
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:08,754
<i>Once there was a way</i>

1390
01:09:08,787 --> 01:09:12,658
<i>To get back homeward</i>

1391
01:09:12,691 --> 01:09:14,159
No.

1392
01:09:16,996 --> 01:09:21,200
<i>Once there was a way</i>

1393
01:09:21,234 --> 01:09:24,738
<i>To get back home</i>

1394
01:09:29,808 --> 01:09:31,544
Oh, Dad.

1395
01:09:31,577 --> 01:09:33,512
I'm so sorry.

1396
01:09:39,885 --> 01:09:43,622
<i>Boy, you're gonna</i>

1397
01:09:43,657 --> 01:09:45,958
<i>- Carry that weight</i>
- Where is Mike?

1398
01:09:45,991 --> 01:09:47,726
He must be dead.

1399
01:09:47,761 --> 01:09:49,663
<i>- Carry that weight</i>
- Come on, let's go!

1400
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:51,597
<i>A long time</i>

1401
01:09:53,466 --> 01:09:56,670
<i>Boy, you're gonna</i>

1402
01:09:56,702 --> 01:09:59,438
<i>- Carry that weight</i>
- Mommy, where are you?

1403
01:09:59,472 --> 01:10:00,806
<i>Carry that weight</i>

1404
01:10:00,839 --> 01:10:03,008
Oh, my gosh.

1405
01:10:03,042 --> 01:10:05,312
<i>- A long time</i>
- Help! Help! - Hold on!

1406
01:10:05,344 --> 01:10:07,314
Mommy's here!

1407
01:10:13,486 --> 01:10:15,488
I'm standing
at the scene right now, Judy,

1408
01:10:15,521 --> 01:10:17,723
and I can tell you it is a miracle

1409
01:10:17,756 --> 01:10:19,925
anyone survived
this unbelievable disaster.

1410
01:10:32,571 --> 01:10:37,776
<i>Golden slumbers</i>

1411
01:10:37,811 --> 01:10:40,347
<i>Fill your eyes</i>

1412
01:10:40,379 --> 01:10:43,717
<i>Sleep, pretty darling</i>

1413
01:10:43,749 --> 01:10:46,985
<i>Do not cry</i>

1414
01:10:47,019 --> 01:10:50,323
<i>And I will sing</i>

1415
01:10:50,357 --> 01:10:52,491
<i>A lullaby.</i>

1416
01:10:55,462 --> 01:10:57,330
Yeah, Buster Moon certainly

1417
01:10:57,364 --> 01:10:59,698
brought down the house
once and for all today.

1418
01:10:59,733 --> 01:11:02,736
And, although Mr. Moon has not
been available for questions,

1419
01:11:02,768 --> 01:11:04,403
unconfirmed reports suggest

1420
01:11:04,437 --> 01:11:05,739
he was responsible

1421
01:11:05,771 --> 01:11:07,406
for building a water tank
that exploded

1422
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:08,574
and flooded the building.

1423
01:11:08,607 --> 01:11:09,908
I've been told the 250 squid

1424
01:11:09,942 --> 01:11:11,710
who had been part of
Moon's display

1425
01:11:11,745 --> 01:11:13,446
are, in fact, employees...

1426
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:14,880
- Eddie?
- of three-star restaurant Les Calmars.

1427
01:11:14,913 --> 01:11:16,449
There's someone at the door.

1428
01:11:16,483 --> 01:11:17,816
And that none of them were harmed

1429
01:11:17,851 --> 01:11:18,852
during the incident.

1430
01:11:18,884 --> 01:11:20,085
Whether they will be returning

1431
01:11:20,119 --> 01:11:21,654
to their usual work is not yet...

1432
01:11:23,757 --> 01:11:25,358
Oh, no.

1433
01:11:25,392 --> 01:11:26,925
Mr. Moon?

1434
01:11:28,594 --> 01:11:30,463
Come on, Moon,
you can't just hide out

1435
01:11:30,497 --> 01:11:31,730
in your buddy's pool house.

1436
01:11:31,765 --> 01:11:33,466
Yeah, we just want to make sure

1437
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:34,833
you're all right, that's all.

1438
01:11:37,470 --> 01:11:40,373
- Hey, Mr. Moon.
- You okay?

1439
01:11:40,407 --> 01:11:43,777
Guys, look, I'm sorry
about what happened,

1440
01:11:43,809 --> 01:11:45,678
and the prize money and...

1441
01:11:45,711 --> 01:11:47,012
Oh, it's okay.

1442
01:11:47,045 --> 01:11:49,715
No, none of this is okay.

1443
01:11:49,748 --> 01:11:51,116
At least we're all in one piece.

1444
01:11:51,150 --> 01:11:53,386
Yeah, and you know what,
I bet we can find

1445
01:11:53,420 --> 01:11:55,020
some other place to put
the show on.

1446
01:11:55,053 --> 01:11:56,054
- Right?
- Yeah.

1447
01:11:56,088 --> 01:11:57,089
The show?

1448
01:11:58,123 --> 01:12:00,859
Guys, I'm done.

1449
01:12:00,894 --> 01:12:03,095
- Are you serious?
- What do you mean, done?

1450
01:12:03,128 --> 01:12:04,397
Come on!

1451
01:12:04,431 --> 01:12:06,665
Didn't you see this? Huh?

1452
01:12:06,699 --> 01:12:09,402
Look, it says
I'm a danger to society.

1453
01:12:09,436 --> 01:12:10,703
- What?
- Gah!

1454
01:12:10,736 --> 01:12:13,606
A deluded, washed-up charlatan

1455
01:12:13,639 --> 01:12:16,375
who never had a hit in his career.

1456
01:12:16,409 --> 01:12:18,143
Oh, come on,
you don't believe all that.

1457
01:12:18,177 --> 01:12:19,778
Yeah, I do.

1458
01:12:19,813 --> 01:12:21,548
Listen, you're not the only one

1459
01:12:21,580 --> 01:12:22,715
who lost something here.

1460
01:12:22,748 --> 01:12:24,016
- We all did.
- Ja!

1461
01:12:24,049 --> 01:12:26,084
I mean, I lost any chance
of ever speaking

1462
01:12:26,118 --> 01:12:27,853
to my dad again over this show.

1463
01:12:27,886 --> 01:12:30,656
- Sorry.
- Oh, Mr. Moon, don't...

1464
01:12:30,689 --> 01:12:32,658
Ah, forget about it.

1465
01:12:32,691 --> 01:12:34,527
What is this?
I don't understand.

1466
01:12:34,561 --> 01:12:36,361
Come on, let's get out of here.

1467
01:12:40,065 --> 01:12:41,568
Mr. Moon?

1468
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:44,002
Meena, please.

1469
01:12:44,036 --> 01:12:46,405
I baked a cake for you

1470
01:12:46,439 --> 01:12:49,041
'cause, well,
I know you're sad right now

1471
01:12:49,074 --> 01:12:51,845
and probably afraid to try
again and...

1472
01:12:51,877 --> 01:12:53,145
Yeah, I am afraid.

1473
01:12:53,178 --> 01:12:54,780
I'm afraid that this...

1474
01:12:54,813 --> 01:12:56,850
this, me, right now,
this is who I am.

1475
01:12:56,882 --> 01:12:58,617
This is...
This is my lot for life...

1476
01:12:58,651 --> 01:13:01,053
That I'm not the guy
that my dad wanted me to be,

1477
01:13:01,086 --> 01:13:02,455
not by a million miles.

1478
01:13:02,489 --> 01:13:03,622
But you told me...

1479
01:13:03,656 --> 01:13:04,823
What? What? What did I say?

1480
01:13:04,858 --> 01:13:06,593
Well, you know,

1481
01:13:06,625 --> 01:13:08,827
don't let fear stop you
from doing the thing you love.

1482
01:13:08,862 --> 01:13:11,997
Ah, come... That's just
a bunch of stupid, corny...

1483
01:13:12,030 --> 01:13:14,032
- No, it's not.
- What, you really believe

1484
01:13:14,066 --> 01:13:15,434
that you're gonna be a singer?

1485
01:13:15,468 --> 01:13:16,935
Well, yeah, maybe.

1486
01:13:16,970 --> 01:13:19,104
Well, then you're just
as big a fool as I am!

1487
01:13:20,673 --> 01:13:22,441
Look, kid.

1488
01:13:22,475 --> 01:13:26,011
You and me, we're both afraid
for good reason.

1489
01:13:26,044 --> 01:13:27,981
Right, 'cause deep down
we know...

1490
01:13:29,682 --> 01:13:31,784
we just don't have what it takes.

1491
01:14:07,119 --> 01:14:09,121
<i>- Wake me up</i>
- I'm awake, I'm awake!

1492
01:14:09,154 --> 01:14:11,590
<i>Before you go go,
'cause I'm not planning on...</i>

1493
01:14:11,624 --> 01:14:13,692
- Hey, Buster.
- Hey, Eddie.

1494
01:14:13,726 --> 01:14:15,662
Man, where'd you go?
Are you okay?

1495
01:14:15,694 --> 01:14:17,195
Listen, could you meet me
at the corner

1496
01:14:17,229 --> 01:14:19,032
of Dinsdale and Lemington?

1497
01:14:19,064 --> 01:14:20,733
Now?

1498
01:14:20,766 --> 01:14:22,234
Yeah, please.

1499
01:14:22,267 --> 01:14:24,671
And could you...

1500
01:14:24,703 --> 01:14:26,171
could you bring me
a spare Speedo?

1501
01:14:27,574 --> 01:14:29,107
Speedo?

1502
01:14:35,113 --> 01:14:36,782
Hey, Miss Crawly.

1503
01:14:36,815 --> 01:14:38,083
Oh, hello, Eddie.

1504
01:14:38,116 --> 01:14:40,218
Hey.
Did you bring the Speedo?

1505
01:14:40,252 --> 01:14:43,556
- The... Oh, yeah, here.
- Great.

1506
01:14:43,590 --> 01:14:46,124
You're a real pal, Eddie.

1507
01:14:46,158 --> 01:14:48,761
Oh, our first customer.

1508
01:14:48,794 --> 01:14:50,128
Miss Crawly, fill the bucket.

1509
01:14:50,162 --> 01:14:51,598
Be right with you, sir.

1510
01:14:51,630 --> 01:14:53,532
Wait.

1511
01:14:53,566 --> 01:14:54,633
What are you doing?

1512
01:14:54,667 --> 01:14:55,834
The only other job I know.

1513
01:14:59,772 --> 01:15:02,075
Just glad my dad isn't here
to see this.

1514
01:15:03,275 --> 01:15:04,743
Miss Crawly, if you would...

1515
01:15:05,811 --> 01:15:06,980
Thanks.

1516
01:15:07,012 --> 01:15:09,648
Well, gotta go to work.

1517
01:15:09,682 --> 01:15:11,183
I'll see you around, Eddie.

1518
01:15:29,102 --> 01:15:31,804
Come on!
I ain't got all day!

1519
01:15:31,837 --> 01:15:32,971
Yeah, yeah...

1520
01:15:33,006 --> 01:15:34,339
Ah, forget it.

1521
01:15:34,373 --> 01:15:36,009
Too slow, dude.

1522
01:15:41,980 --> 01:15:44,117
One moment, please, sir.

1523
01:15:44,149 --> 01:15:47,886
Well, you know the good thing
about hitting rock bottom?

1524
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:51,724
There's only one way left to go,
and that's up.

1525
01:15:51,758 --> 01:15:52,991
Come on.

1526
01:15:53,026 --> 01:15:55,128
You wash, I'll dry.

1527
01:15:58,831 --> 01:16:01,199
Thank you, Miss Crawly.

1528
01:16:23,156 --> 01:16:26,159
<i>Hallelujah</i>

1529
01:16:27,694 --> 01:16:30,697
<i>Hallelujah</i>

1530
01:16:30,729 --> 01:16:35,168
<i>Hallelujah...</i>

1531
01:16:37,202 --> 01:16:40,205
<i>I did my best,
it wasn't much</i>

1532
01:16:40,238 --> 01:16:42,709
Buster, where are you going?

1533
01:16:42,741 --> 01:16:45,078
<i>I couldn't feel,
so I tried to touch</i>

1534
01:16:45,110 --> 01:16:46,679
<i>I've told the truth</i>

1535
01:16:46,713 --> 01:16:48,981
<i>I didn't</i>

1536
01:16:49,014 --> 01:16:51,184
<i>Come to fool you</i>

1537
01:16:52,819 --> 01:16:56,922
<i>And even though
it all went wrong</i>

1538
01:16:56,955 --> 01:17:00,158
<i>I'll stand before
the Lord of Song</i>

1539
01:17:00,193 --> 01:17:03,028
<i>With nothing on my tongue</i>

1540
01:17:03,061 --> 01:17:07,032
<i>But hallelujah</i>

1541
01:17:07,065 --> 01:17:10,002
<i>Hallelujah</i>

1542
01:17:11,104 --> 01:17:13,972
<i>Hallelujah</i>

1543
01:17:15,073 --> 01:17:18,376
<i>Hallelujah</i>

1544
01:17:18,410 --> 01:17:23,782
<i>Hallelujah...</i>

1545
01:17:26,051 --> 01:17:28,400
I...

1546
01:17:28,954 --> 01:17:30,823
Do you think you could
sing like that

1547
01:17:30,857 --> 01:17:32,125
in front of a real
audience?

1548
01:17:32,157 --> 01:17:36,361
I don't know, but I want to try.

1549
01:17:36,394 --> 01:17:37,930
Good.

1550
01:17:37,963 --> 01:17:39,364
'Cause I want to see it.

1551
01:17:41,199 --> 01:17:43,770
We are? Seriously?

1552
01:17:43,802 --> 01:17:44,903
Oh, my gosh! Okay.

1553
01:17:44,937 --> 01:17:46,271
Okay, yes, I'll be right over.

1554
01:17:48,875 --> 01:17:50,243
Hello?

1555
01:17:50,275 --> 01:17:51,878
Oh, hello, Mr. Moon.

1556
01:17:53,478 --> 01:17:55,280
Some say he's the worst showman

1557
01:17:55,313 --> 01:17:56,982
this city's ever seen.

1558
01:17:57,015 --> 01:17:58,416
Some say he's a walking disaster.

1559
01:17:58,450 --> 01:18:00,218
A loose cannon.

1560
01:18:00,253 --> 01:18:01,920
Well, tomorrow night,

1561
01:18:01,954 --> 01:18:03,922
the name Buster Moon will go down

1562
01:18:03,956 --> 01:18:05,758
in entertainment history
once and for all,

1563
01:18:05,792 --> 01:18:08,761
as he and this bunch
of bumbling amateurs

1564
01:18:08,795 --> 01:18:12,397
attempt to restage the show
that brought down his theater.

1565
01:18:12,430 --> 01:18:16,234
<i>Pressure pushing down on me</i>

1566
01:18:16,269 --> 01:18:18,036
<i>Pressing down on you</i>

1567
01:18:18,070 --> 01:18:20,305
<i>No man ask for</i>

1568
01:18:20,338 --> 01:18:22,275
<i>Under pressure</i>

1569
01:18:22,307 --> 01:18:25,210
<i>That burns a building down</i>

1570
01:18:25,243 --> 01:18:29,282
<i>Splits a family in two,
puts people on streets</i>

1571
01:18:36,421 --> 01:18:38,356
<i>That's okay</i>

1572
01:18:38,390 --> 01:18:42,795
<i>It's the terror of knowing
what this world is about</i>

1573
01:18:42,829 --> 01:18:46,364
<i>Watching some good friends
screaming, let me out!</i>

1574
01:18:46,398 --> 01:18:50,502
<i>Pray tomorrow takes me higher</i>

1575
01:18:50,535 --> 01:18:55,040
<i>Pressure on people,
people on streets</i>

1576
01:18:56,541 --> 01:18:59,044
Ah, don't you worry, Mike.
All is forgiven.

1577
01:18:59,077 --> 01:19:00,412
Just glad you're back
in one piece.

1578
01:19:00,445 --> 01:19:02,047
Oh, yeah, you're too kind,
Mr. Moon.

1579
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:04,049
And the... the prize money?

1580
01:19:04,082 --> 01:19:06,151
It's... I mean, it's...
it's real this time, right?

1581
01:19:06,184 --> 01:19:08,520
There is no prize money,
'cause there's no competition.

1582
01:19:08,553 --> 01:19:10,122
Tonight you're singing
for yourselves.

1583
01:19:10,155 --> 01:19:11,958
Two minutes, everybody.
Final checks.

1584
01:19:11,990 --> 01:19:13,226
Singing for ourselves?

1585
01:19:13,258 --> 01:19:14,559
Unbelievable.

1586
01:19:14,593 --> 01:19:16,094
What, what, what is...?
Who's he...?

1587
01:19:16,128 --> 01:19:17,964
This is crazy.
I'm out of here.

1588
01:19:17,996 --> 01:19:19,464
Hello!

1589
01:19:19,497 --> 01:19:22,500
We're...
We're putting on a show here.

1590
01:19:22,534 --> 01:19:25,037
- Hey! - Come on.
- You all should come and see it.

1591
01:19:25,070 --> 01:19:27,405
You! Come on!
Come on, fella!

1592
01:19:27,439 --> 01:19:29,041
It's going to be really good.

1593
01:19:31,043 --> 01:19:32,510
Hey. How's our new stagehand
getting on?

1594
01:19:32,544 --> 01:19:34,312
- He's learning fast.
- All set and standing by!

1595
01:19:34,347 --> 01:19:36,181
I love this headset!

1596
01:19:36,214 --> 01:19:38,050
The audience are
in their seats, Mr. Moon.

1597
01:19:38,083 --> 01:19:39,151
Great!

1598
01:19:41,254 --> 01:19:42,587
- Caspar!
- That's all?

1599
01:19:42,621 --> 01:19:44,957
Get your pants back on, young man!

1600
01:19:44,991 --> 01:19:46,458
Please, you guys, please.

1601
01:19:46,491 --> 01:19:48,060
Please sit down!

1602
01:19:48,093 --> 01:19:49,996
Hey, put your shoes back on right now!

1603
01:19:50,028 --> 01:19:52,564
Zoe, I saw that! Stop it!

1604
01:19:52,597 --> 01:19:55,834
And, Leo, that is disgusting!

1605
01:19:55,868 --> 01:19:57,870
Well, John,
I've covered many disasters

1606
01:19:57,904 --> 01:19:59,972
for this network,
but this is sure to...

1607
01:20:00,006 --> 01:20:01,874
Oh, oh, they're about to start.

1608
01:20:01,908 --> 01:20:03,408
Okay, guys, listen up.

1609
01:20:03,441 --> 01:20:05,278
Look, I gotta tell you...

1610
01:20:05,310 --> 01:20:08,513
there's not much of an audience
out there tonight.

1611
01:20:08,546 --> 01:20:10,115
But you know what?

1612
01:20:10,148 --> 01:20:11,583
It doesn't matter.

1613
01:20:11,616 --> 01:20:13,551
It really doesn't.

1614
01:20:13,585 --> 01:20:16,521
'Cause tonight is our night.

1615
01:20:16,554 --> 01:20:19,892
And whatever happens,
I just want you all to know

1616
01:20:19,926 --> 01:20:22,627
how proud I am to be
a part of this with you.

1617
01:20:22,661 --> 01:20:24,863
Good luck, Mr. Moon.

1618
01:20:24,897 --> 01:20:27,132
Good luck, every...

1619
01:20:31,645 --> 01:20:32,570
Sorry.

1620
01:20:32,604 --> 01:20:34,307
Just jumped the cue there.
Don't worry.

1621
01:20:34,339 --> 01:20:36,309
I'm gonna get the hang of this.

1622
01:20:42,114 --> 01:20:43,148
Here we go.

1623
01:20:48,921 --> 01:20:51,189
All creatures great and small,

1624
01:20:51,223 --> 01:20:53,458
welcome to...

1625
01:20:55,027 --> 01:20:56,628
Oh, hello there.

1626
01:20:56,661 --> 01:20:58,630
Great.

1627
01:20:58,663 --> 01:21:01,599
Welcome to our newly
refurbished, open-air theater.

1628
01:21:01,633 --> 01:21:03,168
Yes, I am your host,
Buster Moon...

1629
01:21:03,201 --> 01:21:04,402
- You ready, big guy?
- Ja!

1630
01:21:04,437 --> 01:21:06,204
I'm, like, totally ready.

1631
01:21:06,238 --> 01:21:07,572
All right.

1632
01:21:07,605 --> 01:21:09,641
Let's do this.

1633
01:21:09,674 --> 01:21:12,044
Gunter and Rosita!

1634
01:21:17,149 --> 01:21:19,484
<i>I stay out too late</i>

1635
01:21:19,517 --> 01:21:21,920
<i>Got nothing in my brain</i>

1636
01:21:23,121 --> 01:21:24,656
<i>That's what people say</i>

1637
01:21:26,058 --> 01:21:27,960
<i>That's what people say</i>

1638
01:21:28,515 --> 01:21:30,295
<i>I go on too many dates</i>

1639
01:21:31,998 --> 01:21:34,100
<i>But I can't make them stay</i>

1640
01:21:34,132 --> 01:21:36,568
<i>At least that's what people say</i>

1641
01:21:37,018 --> 01:21:39,472
<i>That's what people say</i>

1642
01:21:39,504 --> 01:21:40,672
Are you getting this?

1643
01:21:40,705 --> 01:21:43,376
<i>But I keep cruising</i>

1644
01:21:43,408 --> 01:21:46,479
<i>Can't stop, won't stop moving</i>

1645
01:21:46,511 --> 01:21:49,382
<i>It's like I got this music</i>

1646
01:21:49,414 --> 01:21:52,650
<i>In my mind saying,
it's gonna be all right</i>

1647
01:22:04,030 --> 01:22:06,531
<i>I never miss a beat</i>

1648
01:22:06,564 --> 01:22:09,334
<i>I'm lightning on my feet</i>

1649
01:22:09,367 --> 01:22:12,324
<i>And that's what they don't see</i>

1650
01:22:12,670 --> 01:22:15,853
<i>That's what they don't see</i>

1651
01:22:16,409 --> 01:22:19,377
<i>Ja, ja, ja</i>

1652
01:22:19,412 --> 01:22:22,048
<i>'Cause the players gonna play,
play, play, play, play</i>

1653
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:25,317
<i>And the haters gonna hate,
hate, hate, hate, hate, baby</i>

1654
01:22:25,350 --> 01:22:28,086
<i>I'm just gonna shake,
shake, shake, shake, shake</i>

1655
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:30,655
<i>I shake it off, I shake it off</i>

1656
01:22:30,688 --> 01:22:34,026
<i>Players gonna play,
play, play, play, play</i>

1657
01:22:34,060 --> 01:22:36,328
<i>And the haters gonna hate,
hate, hate, hate, hate...</i>

1658
01:22:36,361 --> 01:22:37,395
Aren't they great?

1659
01:22:37,430 --> 01:22:38,763
What, are you kidding me?

1660
01:22:38,797 --> 01:22:40,465
It's like watching Jell-O
dancing around.

1661
01:22:40,498 --> 01:22:43,001
Like you could do
any better, pip-squeak.

1662
01:22:44,302 --> 01:22:45,670
All right, all right, all right.

1663
01:22:45,703 --> 01:22:47,339
Hey!
You want to see something great?

1664
01:22:47,372 --> 01:22:49,641
I'll show you great.

1665
01:22:49,674 --> 01:22:51,643
<i>Heartbreakers gonna break</i>

1666
01:22:53,179 --> 01:22:54,712
<i>Fakers gonna fake</i>

1667
01:22:56,281 --> 01:22:57,749
<i>I'm just gonna shake</i>

1668
01:22:59,284 --> 01:23:02,320
<i>I shake it off, I shake it off</i>

1669
01:23:02,354 --> 01:23:04,522
<i>Shake it off, shake it off</i>

1670
01:23:04,557 --> 01:23:07,292
<i>I shake it off, I shake it off</i>

1671
01:23:07,325 --> 01:23:09,061
<i>I shake it off</i>

1672
01:23:09,095 --> 01:23:10,362
<i>I shake it off</i>

1673
01:23:10,395 --> 01:23:12,198
<i>I shake it off</i>

1674
01:23:12,230 --> 01:23:13,498
<i>I shake it off</i>

1675
01:23:20,505 --> 01:23:23,508
- Yeah, Mommy!
- Gunter and Rosita!

1676
01:23:24,742 --> 01:23:26,344
Kids, no.
Back to your seats.

1677
01:23:26,378 --> 01:23:28,581
- The show's still...
- Okay, okay.

1678
01:23:28,613 --> 01:23:30,615
Norman!

1679
01:23:37,789 --> 01:23:40,226
All right! Piggy power!

1680
01:23:45,563 --> 01:23:47,632
That was great!

1681
01:23:47,665 --> 01:23:49,434
Well, it seems I'm not

1682
01:23:49,467 --> 01:23:51,436
the only one who actually
enjoyed that.

1683
01:23:51,469 --> 01:23:54,607
Crowds are beginning
to arrive at the scene.

1684
01:23:54,639 --> 01:23:55,807
Help!

1685
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:57,575
I'm so sorry, Mr. Moon.

1686
01:23:57,610 --> 01:23:59,177
Johnny, you're on next.

1687
01:24:26,604 --> 01:24:28,806
<i>You could never know what it's like</i>

1688
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:31,544
<i>Your blood like winter
freezes just like ice</i>

1689
01:24:31,576 --> 01:24:34,346
<i>And there's a cold, lonely
light that shines from you</i>

1690
01:24:34,379 --> 01:24:36,314
<i>You'll wind up like the wreck</i>

1691
01:24:36,348 --> 01:24:38,750
<i>You hide behind that mask
you use</i>

1692
01:24:40,585 --> 01:24:42,687
<i>And did you think this fool
could never win?</i>

1693
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:44,756
What is that?
Turn it down, will you?

1694
01:24:44,789 --> 01:24:47,392
<i>I got a taste of love
in a simple way...</i>

1695
01:24:47,425 --> 01:24:49,461
Oi, didn't you hear me?

1696
01:24:49,494 --> 01:24:51,297
I said turn it...

1697
01:24:51,329 --> 01:24:53,431
<i>- You just fade away</i>
- Johnny?

1698
01:24:53,465 --> 01:24:55,700
<i>Don't you know, I'm still standing</i>

1699
01:24:55,733 --> 01:24:57,835
<i>Better than I ever did</i>

1700
01:24:57,869 --> 01:25:00,172
<i>Looking like a true survivor</i>

1701
01:25:00,206 --> 01:25:03,475
- Johnny.
<i>- Feeling like a little kid</i>

1702
01:25:03,508 --> 01:25:06,611
- It's Johnny! That's my son!
<i>- And I'm still standing</i>

1703
01:25:06,644 --> 01:25:08,813
<i>After all this time</i>

1704
01:25:08,846 --> 01:25:11,549
<i>Picking up the pieces of my life</i>

1705
01:25:11,584 --> 01:25:14,220
- My son.
<i>- Without you on my mind</i>

1706
01:25:14,252 --> 01:25:16,754
<i>I'm still standing</i>

1707
01:25:16,788 --> 01:25:19,891
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

1708
01:25:19,924 --> 01:25:22,394
<i>I'm still standing</i>

1709
01:25:22,427 --> 01:25:24,262
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

1710
01:25:24,296 --> 01:25:26,764
- What the...?
- Hey, hey!

1711
01:25:26,798 --> 01:25:28,433
<i>Once I never could hope to win</i>

1712
01:25:28,466 --> 01:25:30,768
- Hey, hey, hey!
<i>- You starting down the road</i>

1713
01:25:30,802 --> 01:25:32,770
<i>Leaving me again</i>

1714
01:25:32,804 --> 01:25:35,207
<i>The threats you made
were meant to cut me down</i>

1715
01:25:35,241 --> 01:25:37,243
<i>And if our love was just a circus</i>

1716
01:25:37,275 --> 01:25:39,612
<i>You'd be a clown by now</i>

1717
01:25:39,644 --> 01:25:42,480
<i>Don't you know, I'm still standing</i>

1718
01:25:42,514 --> 01:25:45,183
<i>Better than I ever did</i>

1719
01:25:45,217 --> 01:25:48,220
<i>Looking like a true survivor</i>

1720
01:25:48,254 --> 01:25:49,622
<i>Feeling like a little kid</i>

1721
01:25:51,389 --> 01:25:53,558
<i>And I'm still standing</i>

1722
01:25:53,591 --> 01:25:56,194
<i>After all this time</i>

1723
01:25:56,228 --> 01:25:58,463
<i>Picking up the pieces of my life</i>

1724
01:25:58,496 --> 01:26:01,699
<i>Without you on my mind</i>

1725
01:26:01,734 --> 01:26:03,535
<i>I'm still standing</i>

1726
01:26:03,568 --> 01:26:05,537
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

1727
01:26:07,305 --> 01:26:08,940
<i>I'm still standing</i>

1728
01:26:08,973 --> 01:26:11,309
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

1729
01:26:12,477 --> 01:26:14,546
<i>I'm still standing</i>

1730
01:26:14,579 --> 01:26:16,581
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

1731
01:26:22,020 --> 01:26:23,688
What about that, huh?

1732
01:26:23,721 --> 01:26:25,690
Give it up for Johnny, folks.

1733
01:26:25,723 --> 01:26:27,425
Yeah!

1734
01:26:36,769 --> 01:26:38,603
Johnny! Johnny!

1735
01:26:38,636 --> 01:26:40,605
What's with the face?
You were great.

1736
01:26:40,638 --> 01:26:41,873
They loved you.

1737
01:26:43,676 --> 01:26:45,543
Yeah, thanks, Rosita.

1738
01:26:56,521 --> 01:26:57,722
All right.

1739
01:26:57,755 --> 01:26:59,391
Welcome to all you newcomers.

1740
01:26:59,425 --> 01:27:01,959
You are just in time
to meet a teenager

1741
01:27:01,993 --> 01:27:04,697
who was recently dumped
by her boyfriend.

1742
01:27:04,937 --> 01:27:07,299
I know, right?

1743
01:27:07,333 --> 01:27:09,401
But she's gonna chase
those blues away

1744
01:27:09,435 --> 01:27:11,002
with a song of her very own.

1745
01:27:11,035 --> 01:27:15,473
Allow me to introduce
the singing sensation, Ash.

1746
01:27:31,589 --> 01:27:32,990
Judith?

1747
01:27:33,024 --> 01:27:35,728
You are all trespassing
on private property.

1748
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:37,363
- What?!
- And you will leave right now.

1749
01:27:37,395 --> 01:27:38,930
I didn't... No, no, no,
no, no, no, Judith...

1750
01:27:38,963 --> 01:27:39,931
All of you.

1751
01:27:55,848 --> 01:27:59,784
<i>I followed my heart into the fire</i>

1752
01:27:59,817 --> 01:28:03,555
<i>Got burned,
got broken down by desire</i>

1753
01:28:03,588 --> 01:28:06,859
<i>I tried, I tried,
but the smoke in my eyes</i>

1754
01:28:06,891 --> 01:28:08,693
<i>Left me blurry</i>

1755
01:28:08,726 --> 01:28:10,462
<i>Blurry and blind</i>

1756
01:28:10,496 --> 01:28:12,564
<i>I picked all the pieces</i>

1757
01:28:12,597 --> 01:28:14,400
<i>Up off the ground</i>

1758
01:28:14,432 --> 01:28:17,068
<i>Got dirt on my fingers,
but that's gone now</i>

1759
01:28:17,101 --> 01:28:19,937
<i>- Got the glue in my hands</i>
- I am calling the police.

1760
01:28:19,971 --> 01:28:22,974
<i>I'm sticking to the plan,
sticking to the plan</i>

1761
01:28:23,007 --> 01:28:27,780
<i>That says I can do
anything at all</i>

1762
01:28:27,812 --> 01:28:30,982
<i>I can do anything at all</i>

1763
01:28:31,015 --> 01:28:34,420
<i>This is my kiss good-bye</i>

1764
01:28:34,452 --> 01:28:37,790
<i>You can stand alone
and watch me fly</i>

1765
01:28:37,822 --> 01:28:39,757
<i>'Cause nothing's
keeping me down</i>

1766
01:28:39,792 --> 01:28:41,759
<i>Gonna let it all out</i>

1767
01:28:41,794 --> 01:28:45,630
<i>Come on and say it right now,
right now, right now...</i>

1768
01:28:46,497 --> 01:28:47,832
Seriously?

1769
01:28:47,865 --> 01:28:49,834
She's not even that good.

1770
01:28:49,867 --> 01:28:51,969
Yeah, yeah, totally.

1771
01:28:56,073 --> 01:28:59,043
<i>This is my big hello</i>

1772
01:28:59,076 --> 01:29:02,647
<i>'Cause I'm here
and never letting go</i>

1773
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:04,682
<i>I can finally see</i>

1774
01:29:04,716 --> 01:29:06,684
<i>It's not just a dream</i>

1775
01:29:06,718 --> 01:29:10,121
<i>When you set it all free,
all free, all free</i>

1776
01:29:10,154 --> 01:29:12,790
<i>You set it all free</i>

1777
01:29:25,069 --> 01:29:27,672
<i>This is my big hello</i>

1778
01:29:27,705 --> 01:29:31,477
<i>'Cause I'm here
and never letting go</i>

1779
01:29:31,509 --> 01:29:34,847
<i>I can finally see
it's not just a dream</i>

1780
01:29:34,879 --> 01:29:38,851
<i>When you set it all free,
all free, all free</i>

1781
01:29:38,883 --> 01:29:41,453
<i>You set it all free.</i>

1782
01:29:50,207 --> 01:29:52,697
You guys okay?

1783
01:29:58,035 --> 01:30:00,506
Ash! Ash! Ash! Ash!

1784
01:30:00,538 --> 01:30:01,673
Ash! Ash! Ash!

1785
01:30:01,706 --> 01:30:04,610
What about that?

1786
01:30:04,642 --> 01:30:08,480
We just witnessed the birth
of a genuine rock star!

1787
01:30:08,514 --> 01:30:10,748
Moon, you...
you've got some stuck here.

1788
01:30:22,594 --> 01:30:24,762
He may be tiny,

1789
01:30:24,796 --> 01:30:27,198
but there is no denying
his enormous talent.

1790
01:30:27,231 --> 01:30:30,835
Would you please welcome
to the stage Mike.

1791
01:30:30,868 --> 01:30:32,670
What are you doing back here?

1792
01:30:32,704 --> 01:30:34,071
Relax, sweetheart.
Just came back

1793
01:30:34,105 --> 01:30:36,207
to show you bozos
how it's really done.

1794
01:30:36,240 --> 01:30:38,175
Now, watch this.

1795
01:30:43,114 --> 01:30:45,683
<i>And now</i>

1796
01:30:45,717 --> 01:30:48,953
<i>The end is near</i>

1797
01:30:48,986 --> 01:30:52,024
<i>And so I face</i>

1798
01:30:52,056 --> 01:30:55,928
<i>The final curtain</i>

1799
01:30:55,960 --> 01:30:58,062
<i>My friend</i>

1800
01:30:58,095 --> 01:31:00,598
<i>I'll say it clear</i>

1801
01:31:00,632 --> 01:31:03,535
<i>And state my case</i>

1802
01:31:03,569 --> 01:31:06,003
<i>Of which I'm certain</i>

1803
01:31:07,605 --> 01:31:09,507
<i>I've lived</i>

1804
01:31:09,541 --> 01:31:11,108
<i>- A life that's full</i>
- Boss! That is him!

1805
01:31:11,142 --> 01:31:12,678
That is Mike!

1806
01:31:12,710 --> 01:31:15,780
<i>I've traveled each</i>

1807
01:31:15,813 --> 01:31:19,551
<i>And every highway</i>

1808
01:31:19,585 --> 01:31:23,589
<i>And more, much more than this</i>

1809
01:31:23,621 --> 01:31:25,289
<i>I did it</i>

1810
01:31:25,323 --> 01:31:30,127
<i>My way</i>

1811
01:31:30,161 --> 01:31:31,796
<i>Regrets</i>

1812
01:31:32,897 --> 01:31:35,701
<i>I've had a few</i>

1813
01:31:35,733 --> 01:31:38,570
<i>But then again</i>

1814
01:31:38,604 --> 01:31:42,306
<i>Too few to mention</i>

1815
01:31:42,340 --> 01:31:44,642
<i>I did</i>

1816
01:31:44,676 --> 01:31:47,912
<i>What I had to do</i>

1817
01:31:47,945 --> 01:31:50,281
<i>And saw it through</i>

1818
01:31:50,314 --> 01:31:53,017
<i>Without exemption</i>

1819
01:31:53,050 --> 01:31:54,686
I'm so proud of you.

1820
01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:56,588
<i>I planned</i>

1821
01:31:56,622 --> 01:31:58,790
<i>Each charted course</i>

1822
01:31:58,823 --> 01:32:02,094
<i>Each careful step</i>

1823
01:32:02,126 --> 01:32:05,229
<i>Along the byway</i>

1824
01:32:06,764 --> 01:32:11,003
<i>And more,
much more than this</i>

1825
01:32:11,035 --> 01:32:12,604
<i>I did it</i>

1826
01:32:12,638 --> 01:32:15,807
<i>My way</i>

1827
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:17,109
You gotta be kidding me.

1828
01:32:17,141 --> 01:32:19,811
<i>For what is a mouse</i>

1829
01:32:19,844 --> 01:32:21,579
<i>What has he got</i>

1830
01:32:22,980 --> 01:32:24,750
<i>If not himself</i>

1831
01:32:25,950 --> 01:32:28,754
<i>Then he has not</i>

1832
01:32:28,786 --> 01:32:32,056
<i>To say the things</i>

1833
01:32:32,089 --> 01:32:35,159
<i>He truly feels</i>

1834
01:32:35,192 --> 01:32:37,361
<i>And not the words</i>

1835
01:32:37,395 --> 01:32:41,332
<i>Of one who kneels</i>

1836
01:32:41,365 --> 01:32:44,702
<i>The record shows</i>

1837
01:32:44,736 --> 01:32:47,104
<i>I took the blows</i>

1838
01:32:47,139 --> 01:32:48,940
Negative.
I've lost sight of the suspect

1839
01:32:48,973 --> 01:32:50,742
and am terminating pursuit.

1840
01:32:52,710 --> 01:32:55,681
<i>And did it</i>

1841
01:32:55,713 --> 01:33:02,688
<i>My way...</i>

1842
01:33:08,726 --> 01:33:12,096
That pip-squeak really was great.

1843
01:33:12,129 --> 01:33:13,230
Thank you.

1844
01:33:13,264 --> 01:33:14,700
Thank you so much.

1845
01:33:14,732 --> 01:33:16,300
Oh, please.
You're too kind, really.

1846
01:33:16,333 --> 01:33:18,002
Look at me.
I'm turning red.

1847
01:33:18,035 --> 01:33:19,737
Stop. I can't take it.

1848
01:33:19,771 --> 01:33:21,238
Keep... Keep it coming.

1849
01:33:21,272 --> 01:33:23,007
Well, I better get back.

1850
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:24,976
They'll be wondering
what happened to me.

1851
01:33:25,009 --> 01:33:27,344
You'll visit me though, yeah?

1852
01:33:27,378 --> 01:33:29,013
Yeah, course I will.

1853
01:33:30,716 --> 01:33:32,084
See you, son.

1854
01:33:41,425 --> 01:33:45,831
We have one final act
for you tonight.

1855
01:33:45,863 --> 01:33:47,665
Would you please welcome
to the stage

1856
01:33:47,699 --> 01:33:50,802
for her first ever
live appearance...

1857
01:33:50,836 --> 01:33:52,036
Meena.

1858
01:33:54,840 --> 01:33:56,307
Meena?

1859
01:33:57,408 --> 01:33:59,410
Is she coming out?

1860
01:33:59,443 --> 01:34:01,747
Meena, what's wrong?
Are you okay?

1861
01:34:01,779 --> 01:34:03,948
I can't move.

1862
01:34:03,981 --> 01:34:06,317
I'm... I'm terrified.

1863
01:34:09,186 --> 01:34:10,822
Give me your hand, kid.

1864
01:34:13,090 --> 01:34:14,058
Okay, deep breaths.

1865
01:34:14,091 --> 01:34:15,092
Deep breaths.

1866
01:34:15,127 --> 01:34:16,961
And remember what I told you.

1867
01:34:16,994 --> 01:34:19,030
You will not feel afraid anymore

1868
01:34:19,063 --> 01:34:22,266
if you just start singing.

1869
01:34:22,299 --> 01:34:24,802
Meena! Meena!

1870
01:34:24,836 --> 01:34:27,139
I can do it... Okay.

1871
01:34:27,171 --> 01:34:29,241
Oh! Oh, I'm so sorry.

1872
01:34:33,018 --> 01:34:34,178
Okay.

1873
01:34:40,351 --> 01:34:42,386
Sing.

1874
01:34:43,521 --> 01:34:45,456
Okay.

1875
01:34:48,926 --> 01:34:54,031
<i>Everybody's got a thing</i>

1876
01:34:54,065 --> 01:34:58,002
<i>But some don't know</i>

1877
01:34:58,035 --> 01:35:01,305
<i>How to handle it</i>

1878
01:35:03,275 --> 01:35:07,378
<i>Always reaching out</i>

1879
01:35:07,411 --> 01:35:09,781
<i>In vain</i>

1880
01:35:09,815 --> 01:35:12,149
<i>Accepting the things</i>

1881
01:35:12,184 --> 01:35:15,821
<i>Not worth having</i>

1882
01:35:15,853 --> 01:35:19,123
<i>But don't you worry</i>

1883
01:35:19,156 --> 01:35:22,393
<i>'Bout a thing</i>

1884
01:35:22,426 --> 01:35:24,296
<i>Don't you worry</i>

1885
01:35:24,328 --> 01:35:29,033
<i>'Bout a thing, mama</i>

1886
01:35:29,066 --> 01:35:33,004
<i>'Cause I'll be standing on</i>

1887
01:35:33,037 --> 01:35:35,941
<i>The side when</i>

1888
01:35:35,973 --> 01:35:39,243
<i>You check it out</i>

1889
01:35:41,478 --> 01:35:43,180
<i>They say your style</i>

1890
01:35:43,215 --> 01:35:45,249
<i>Of life's a drag</i>

1891
01:35:45,282 --> 01:35:49,020
<i>And that you must go
other places</i>

1892
01:35:49,053 --> 01:35:52,858
<i>Just don't you feel too bad</i>

1893
01:35:52,890 --> 01:35:57,128
<i>When you get fooled
by smiling faces</i>

1894
01:35:57,161 --> 01:36:01,132
<i>Don't you worry
'bout a thing</i>

1895
01:36:01,165 --> 01:36:04,970
<i>Don't you worry
'bout a thing, baby</i>

1896
01:36:05,002 --> 01:36:08,405
<i>'Cause I'll be standing
on the side</i>

1897
01:36:08,439 --> 01:36:10,141
<i>When you check it</i>

1898
01:36:10,174 --> 01:36:15,847
<i>Out...</i>

1899
01:36:17,114 --> 01:36:20,986
<i>When you get off</i>

1900
01:36:21,018 --> 01:36:22,820
<i>Your trip...</i>

1901
01:36:22,854 --> 01:36:24,890
Guys, guys, wait.
We can talk this over, right?

1902
01:36:24,922 --> 01:36:26,557
We're all reasonable
individuals here.

1903
01:36:31,595 --> 01:36:33,064
Get in! Quick!

1904
01:36:33,097 --> 01:36:34,398
Oh, thank you, sweetheart.

1905
01:36:35,599 --> 01:36:37,134
Whew! That was close.

1906
01:36:37,168 --> 01:36:38,302
Yeah.

1907
01:36:40,304 --> 01:36:43,540
<i>Everybody needs a change</i>

1908
01:36:43,574 --> 01:36:47,478
<i>A chance to check out
the new, yeah</i>

1909
01:36:47,511 --> 01:36:51,283
<i>You're the only one who sees</i>

1910
01:36:51,315 --> 01:36:55,086
<i>The changes you take
yourself through</i>

1911
01:37:11,335 --> 01:37:13,971
<i>Don't you worry
'bout a thing</i>

1912
01:37:15,472 --> 01:37:18,944
<i>Don't you worry
'bout a thing</i>

1913
01:37:18,976 --> 01:37:23,014
<i>Don't you worry
'bout a thing</i>

1914
01:37:23,048 --> 01:37:27,084
<i>Don't you worry
'bout a thing</i>

1915
01:37:38,330 --> 01:37:39,396
Come on!

1916
01:37:43,969 --> 01:37:47,138
<i>Don't you worry</i>

1917
01:37:47,171 --> 01:37:52,143
<i>Don't you worry
'bout a thing, mama</i>

1918
01:37:52,176 --> 01:37:53,911
<i>'Cause I'll be standing</i>

1919
01:37:53,945 --> 01:37:55,913
<i>I'll be standing</i>

1920
01:37:55,947 --> 01:37:59,650
<i>For you</i>

1921
01:38:10,095 --> 01:38:15,532
<i>Don't you worry
'bout a thing</i>

1922
01:38:20,005 --> 01:38:22,974
- Meena! You did it! - She did it!
- That's my granddaughter!

1923
01:38:23,008 --> 01:38:25,076
Go, go!

1924
01:38:33,317 --> 01:38:36,453
Oh, Dad,
I wish you could see this.

1925
01:39:16,627 --> 01:39:21,166
<i>Once there was a way</i>

1926
01:39:21,198 --> 01:39:26,737
<i>To get back homeward</i>

1927
01:39:28,705 --> 01:39:33,110
<i>Once there was a way</i>

1928
01:39:33,144 --> 01:39:36,181
<i>To get back home</i>

1929
01:39:36,213 --> 01:39:38,582
<i>Sleep, pretty darling</i>

1930
01:39:38,615 --> 01:39:41,585
<i>Do not cry</i>

1931
01:39:43,088 --> 01:39:45,489
<i>And I will sing</i>

1932
01:39:45,522 --> 01:39:51,728
<i>A lullaby...</i>

1933
01:39:54,431 --> 01:39:56,367
Everybody ready?

1934
01:39:56,400 --> 01:39:59,736
All creatures great and small,

welcome to the New Moon Theater.

1936
01:40:22,259 --> 01:40:25,162
<i>See the girl
with the diamonds in her shoes</i>

1937
01:40:25,196 --> 01:40:27,599
<i>She walks around
like she's got nothing to lose</i>

1938
01:40:27,631 --> 01:40:30,667
<i>Yeah, she's a go-getter,
she's everybody's type</i>

1939
01:40:30,701 --> 01:40:33,704
<i>She's the queen of the city,
but she don't believe the hype</i>

1940
01:40:33,737 --> 01:40:36,508
<i>She's got her own elevation,
holy motivation</i>

1941
01:40:36,540 --> 01:40:39,843
<i>So I wrote some letters
out in big bold type</i>

1942
01:40:39,877 --> 01:40:42,514
<i>I got faith in you, baby</i>

1943
01:40:42,546 --> 01:40:45,716
<i>I got faith in you now</i>

1944
01:40:45,749 --> 01:40:49,186
<i>And you've been such a,
such a good friend to me</i>

1945
01:40:49,220 --> 01:40:51,623

<i>See the boy with
the Stevie Wonder swag</i>

1949
01:41:01,798 --> 01:41:04,368
<i>Ain't got a clue
all the magic that he has</i>

1950
01:41:04,401 --> 01:41:07,272
<i>He's a go-getter,
he's everybody's type</i>

1951
01:41:07,304 --> 01:41:10,307
<i>Gonna make it my mission
make him feel all right</i>

1952
01:41:10,341 --> 01:41:13,444
<i>He's a twelve on a ten-point,
rockin' out to his joint</i>

1953
01:41:13,477 --> 01:41:15,846
<i>Just say the word
'cause I could sing all night</i>

1954

<i>I get her running
and my mind goes crazy</i>

1961
01:41:38,369 --> 01:41:41,372
<i>I think about you
morning, noon, night and day</i>

1962
