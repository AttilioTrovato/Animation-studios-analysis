00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,827
Hello, everybody.
Thanks for coming.

2
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,915
I am the Lorax.
I speak for the trees.

3
00:00:57,082 --> 00:00:59,877
And I'd like to say
a few words, if you please.

4
00:01:00,043 --> 00:01:02,588
Regarding the story
that you're about to see

5
00:01:02,754 --> 00:01:05,716
it actually happened.
Just take it from me.

6
00:01:05,883 --> 00:01:08,927
But there's more to this story
than what's on the page,

7
00:01:09,094 --> 00:01:12,222
so please pay attention
while I set the stage.

8
00:01:13,557 --> 00:01:18,687
<i>We open in Thneedville, a city they
say that was plastic and fake,</i>

9
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:20,731
<i>and they liked it that way!</i>

10
00:01:20,898 --> 00:01:24,818
<i>A town without nature,
not one living tree.</i>

11
00:01:24,943 --> 00:01:26,570
<i>So, what happened to them?</i>

12
00:01:26,778 --> 00:01:30,032
<i>Cue the music! Let's see.</i>

13
00:01:39,917 --> 00:01:41,418
<i>Buzz. Buzz.</i>

14
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:09,488
<i>In Thneedville,
it's a brand new dawn</i>

15
00:02:11,114 --> 00:02:14,868
<i>With brand new cars
and houses and lawns</i>

16
00:02:15,035 --> 00:02:17,954
<i>Here in
Got-all-that-we-need-ville</i>

17
00:02:18,288 --> 00:02:23,710
<i>In Thneedville,
we manufacture our trees</i>

18
00:02:25,629 --> 00:02:30,384
<i>Each one is made in factories</i>

19
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,303
<i>And uses 96 batteries</i>

20
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:39,476
<i>In Thneedville,
the air's not so clean</i>

21
00:02:41,061 --> 00:02:42,729
<i>So we buy it fresh</i>

22
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:45,023
<i>It comes out this machine!</i>

23
00:02:45,148 --> 00:02:47,901
<i>In Satisfaction's-
guaranteed-ville</i>

24
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:53,407
<i>In Thneedville,
we don't want to know</i>

25
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,496
<i>Where the smog and trash
and chemicals go</i>

26
00:02:59,663 --> 00:03:03,834
<i>I just went swimming,
and now I glow</i>

27
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:07,504
<i>In Thneedville,
we have fun year round</i>

28
00:03:07,671 --> 00:03:11,007
<i>We surf and snowboard
right in town</i>

29
00:03:11,174 --> 00:03:14,845
<i>We thank the Lord
for all we've got</i>

30
00:03:15,011 --> 00:03:18,682
<i>Including this
brand new parking lot!</i>

31
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:24,938
<i>Parking lot!</i>

32
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:31,862
<i>Oh, look, it's Aloysius O'Hare</i>

33
00:03:32,028 --> 00:03:35,407
<i>Aloysius O'Hare</i>

34
00:03:35,657 --> 00:03:39,870
<i>The man who found
a way to sell air</i>

35
00:03:40,245 --> 00:03:42,372
<i>And became a zillionaire</i>

36
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:46,543
Hip-hip-hooray!

37
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:49,880
<i>In Thneedville,
we love living this way</i>

38
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:53,800
<i>It's like living in paradise</i>

39
00:03:53,884 --> 00:03:56,803
<i>It's perfect!
And that's how it will stay</i>

40
00:03:56,887 --> 00:03:57,971
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

41
00:03:58,054 --> 00:04:00,640
<i>Here in
Love-the-life-we-lead-ville</i>

42
00:04:00,724 --> 00:04:02,475
<i>Destined-to-succeed-ville</i>

43
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:04,644
<i>We-are-all-agreed-ville</i>

44
00:04:04,728 --> 00:04:07,814
<i>We love it here in...</i>

45
00:04:09,774 --> 00:04:11,443
<i>Thneedville!</i>

46
00:04:51,107 --> 00:04:52,400
Yes!

47
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:08,375
Oh, hi, Ted.

48
00:05:09,626 --> 00:05:11,836
Oh, hey, Audrey. Hi.

49
00:05:12,128 --> 00:05:14,798
Did your ball land
in my backyard again?

50
00:05:14,923 --> 00:05:16,383
What? No.

51
00:05:16,633 --> 00:05:18,426
A model airplane, this time.

52
00:05:19,469 --> 00:05:21,846
Hey, do you want to
see something cool?

53
00:05:22,013 --> 00:05:23,181
Come on.

54
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:31,147
Whoa!

55
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:39,447
Did you...

56
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:41,616
Did you paint this?

57
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:43,618
Do you like it?
What?

58
00:05:43,952 --> 00:05:47,539
Are you kidding?
This is amazing!

59
00:05:47,789 --> 00:05:48,873
What are those?

60
00:05:48,957 --> 00:05:52,085
Those are trees.
Real ones.

61
00:05:52,377 --> 00:05:55,463
They used to grow
all around here.

62
00:05:56,381 --> 00:05:59,259
And people said that
the touch of their tufts

63
00:05:59,342 --> 00:06:01,886
was softer than
anything, even silk.

64
00:06:02,137 --> 00:06:04,722
And they smelled
like butterfly milk!

65
00:06:04,806 --> 00:06:07,016
Wow! What does
that even mean?

66
00:06:07,308 --> 00:06:08,518
I know, right?

67
00:06:10,895 --> 00:06:11,980
Oh, yeah.

68
00:06:12,063 --> 00:06:15,567
What I want more than anything
in the whole world is to see

69
00:06:16,025 --> 00:06:18,111
a real living tree

70
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:19,988
growing in my backyard.

71
00:06:20,363 --> 00:06:23,116
So if, say... I'm just
thinking out loud here.

72
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,952
If a guy somehow got you one...

73
00:06:26,161 --> 00:06:28,329
I'd probably
marry him on the spot.

74
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:31,166
I bet that sounds crazy.
Does that sound crazy?

75
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:33,251
No! Not crazy.

76
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,670
Not crazy at all.

77
00:06:42,844 --> 00:06:45,555
Ted, honey,
don't play with your food.

78
00:06:45,722 --> 00:06:47,015
You, either, Mom.

79
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:56,649
So, Mom, do you happen to
know if there's any place

80
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:59,235
where I could get a real tree?

81
00:06:59,402 --> 00:07:02,155
Ted, we already have a tree.
It's the latest model.

82
00:07:02,405 --> 00:07:04,616
Yeah, but I mean a real one

83
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:07,785
that grows out of
the ground or whatever.

84
00:07:07,869 --> 00:07:09,370
You know, a real tree.

85
00:07:09,537 --> 00:07:10,580
Really?

86
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:13,499
You would rather
have some dirty, messy

87
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,085
lump of wood that just
sticks out of the ground?

88
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:17,545
And it does what? I don't
even know what it does.

89
00:07:17,629 --> 00:07:18,755
What's its purpose?

90
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:20,131
Look at what we've got.

91
00:07:20,215 --> 00:07:23,509
It's the Oak-amatic. The only
tree with its own remote.

92
00:07:23,885 --> 00:07:26,638
Summer, autumn, winter,

93
00:07:26,721 --> 00:07:27,931
and disco!

94
00:07:32,769 --> 00:07:34,395
Mom? Come on, Ted. Get into it.

95
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:35,563
Dance with the tree.

96
00:07:35,647 --> 00:07:37,690
Oh, it hurts, Mom. Please stop.

97
00:07:38,232 --> 00:07:40,234
So' anyway...

98
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,195
Let's just say I need a tree.

99
00:07:42,278 --> 00:07:43,863
Where would I go?
What do I do?

100
00:07:44,072 --> 00:07:47,075
Then you know what? You
need to find the Once-ler.

101
00:07:48,117 --> 00:07:49,160
The what?

102
00:07:49,243 --> 00:07:54,499
Mom, it's not really the time for
one of your magical fables, okay?

103
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:56,876
That's right, I forgot.

104
00:07:57,085 --> 00:08:00,546
I'm old and can't even
remember to put my teeth in.

105
00:08:00,797 --> 00:08:02,590
Stand down.
That's not what I meant.

106
00:08:02,674 --> 00:08:04,634
No, really, I forgot my teeth.

107
00:08:04,926 --> 00:08:07,512
Would you be a dear
and go get them for me?

108
00:08:07,595 --> 00:08:09,514
Sure, Mom.

109
00:08:16,104 --> 00:08:17,313
Okay, here's the deal.

110
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,525
The Once-ler is the man who knows
what happened to the trees.

111
00:08:20,608 --> 00:08:22,944
You want one,
you need to find him.

112
00:08:23,027 --> 00:08:25,697
The Once-ler?
Mmm-hmm.

113
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:28,199
Okay. Grammy,
is this a real thing

114
00:08:28,282 --> 00:08:29,659
that we're talking about now?

115
00:08:29,784 --> 00:08:31,452
Oh, he's real all right.

116
00:08:31,786 --> 00:08:33,538
Well, where can I find him?

117
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:40,294
Far outside of town
where the grass never grows

118
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:44,132
and the wind smells slow
and sour when it blows.

119
00:08:46,467 --> 00:08:50,680
And no birds ever sing,
excepting old crows.

120
00:08:53,808 --> 00:08:54,976
Quit doing that.

121
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:57,520
That's the place
where the Once-ler lives.

122
00:08:57,603 --> 00:08:59,939
Wait, outside of town?

123
00:09:00,857 --> 00:09:04,485
People used to say
if you brought him 15 cents,

124
00:09:04,652 --> 00:09:05,695
<i>a nail</i>

125
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:09,866
<i>and the shell of a great,
great, great grandfather snail,</i>

126
00:09:11,826 --> 00:09:14,662
<i>he would tell you everything.</i>

127
00:09:44,692 --> 00:09:45,735
Hmm.

128
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,685
Mr. O'Hare,
what we've got for you

129
00:10:19,769 --> 00:10:22,063
is something that is
going to take O'Hare Air

130
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,898
to the next level.

131
00:10:24,106 --> 00:10:25,983
Now, Mr. O'Hare,
I know what you're thinking.

132
00:10:26,067 --> 00:10:28,194
One, "I've gotten rich
selling people air that's"

133
00:10:28,277 --> 00:10:30,363
"fresher than
the stinky stuff outside"

134
00:10:30,446 --> 00:10:32,073
Two, and here is
the important one,

135
00:10:32,156 --> 00:10:34,575
"How can I possibly make
even more money?"

136
00:10:34,784 --> 00:10:36,577
We can tell you, sir!
We can tell you.

137
00:10:36,744 --> 00:10:39,413
Check out this commercial, huh?

138
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:44,377
Well, here goes
another lame Saturday.

139
00:10:44,961 --> 00:10:47,922
Dude, I don't think so!

140
00:10:49,423 --> 00:10:50,508
Huh!

141
00:10:51,592 --> 00:10:52,718
Hey!

142
00:10:55,304 --> 00:10:56,347
Man!

143
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:57,515
Oh, yeah!

144
00:10:58,474 --> 00:10:59,600
What!

145
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,480
Yeah!

146
00:11:05,147 --> 00:11:07,942
<i>O'Hare purified air.
Freshness to go.</i>

147
00:11:08,025 --> 00:11:09,360
<i>Please breathe responsibly.</i>

148
00:11:09,443 --> 00:11:10,569
Ah?

149
00:11:10,653 --> 00:11:12,405
Oh, my goodness. Yeah!
Love it.

150
00:11:12,947 --> 00:11:14,907
You got to be kidding me.

151
00:11:14,991 --> 00:11:17,952
You really think people are
stupid enough to buy this?

152
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:21,706
Our research shows that if you put
something in a plastic bottle,

153
00:11:21,789 --> 00:11:22,957
people will buy it.

154
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,166
Exactly. And...

155
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,252
And what's more, when
we build a new factory

156
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,920
to make the plastic bottles,

157
00:11:28,045 --> 00:11:30,506
the air quality is
just going to get worse.

158
00:11:30,715 --> 00:11:32,717
Which will make people
want our air even more,

159
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,760
and drive sales where?

160
00:11:34,885 --> 00:11:35,928
Through the roof!

161
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:40,641
So, in other words,
the more smog in the sky

162
00:11:42,518 --> 00:11:43,978
the more people will buy.

163
00:11:46,188 --> 00:11:49,608
See, that's why he's the genius!
It even rhymes!

164
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:52,445
I'm aware it rhymes.

165
00:11:53,362 --> 00:11:54,488
Coats. Big.

166
00:11:54,572 --> 00:11:56,073
What do you two
knuckleheads want?

167
00:11:56,157 --> 00:11:57,616
I'm in the middle of a meeting!

168
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:01,704
What?

169
00:12:01,996 --> 00:12:03,456
Why is he leaving town?

170
00:12:03,581 --> 00:12:05,499
No one ever leaves town!

171
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,626
See what he's up to.

172
00:12:18,929 --> 00:12:20,264
Whoa!

173
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:13,317
Huh?

174
00:13:15,152 --> 00:13:16,487
Whoa! Whoa.

175
00:13:19,782 --> 00:13:21,116
Oh, man.

176
00:14:21,343 --> 00:14:22,636
Whoa!

177
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:24,430
All right.

178
00:15:03,093 --> 00:15:04,178
Okay.

179
00:15:05,012 --> 00:15:07,181
What the...

180
00:15:07,264 --> 00:15:08,766
Whoa!

181
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:17,566
Who are you?

182
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:20,068
Who are you and what
are you doing here?

183
00:15:20,235 --> 00:15:22,654
I'm Ted. I'm Ted.

184
00:15:22,905 --> 00:15:25,491
I can't breathe.
Are you the Once-ler?

185
00:15:25,657 --> 00:15:27,868
Oh, man.
Didn't you read the signs?

186
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,287
No one is
supposed to come here.

187
00:15:30,579 --> 00:15:32,581
Get out of here
and leave me alone!

188
00:15:32,664 --> 00:15:34,666
And don't let the boot
hit you on the way out.

189
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,834
The boot?

190
00:15:36,627 --> 00:15:37,669
Hello!

191
00:15:37,753 --> 00:15:38,837
Ow!

192
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:42,049
Listen! People say that if
someone brings you this stuff

193
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:44,218
that you will tell
them about trees.

194
00:15:44,593 --> 00:15:45,677
No, no, no!

195
00:15:48,263 --> 00:15:49,473
Trees?

196
00:15:49,681 --> 00:15:51,016
Yeah, real ones.

197
00:15:51,141 --> 00:15:53,852
You know,
that grow out of the ground?

198
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:56,480
Hello?

199
00:15:56,563 --> 00:15:58,023
Sorry, it's just...

200
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,651
Well, I didn't think anyone
still cared about trees.

201
00:16:00,734 --> 00:16:04,238
Well, that's me. The guy
who still cares. I'm here.

202
00:16:04,404 --> 00:16:06,615
Hey! What?

203
00:16:07,783 --> 00:16:09,159
Do you want to
know about trees?

204
00:16:09,243 --> 00:16:11,578
About what happened to them?

205
00:16:11,745 --> 00:16:15,666
Why they're all gone?
It's because of me.

206
00:16:15,749 --> 00:16:16,792
Wait, what?

207
00:16:22,631 --> 00:16:24,841
It's because of me!

208
00:16:26,927 --> 00:16:30,556
And my invention, the Thneed.

209
00:16:30,931 --> 00:16:35,102
It was an amazing product that
could do the job of a thousand.

210
00:16:36,478 --> 00:16:37,521
All right.

211
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,731
Sounds ridiculous,
but I mean, that's cool.

212
00:16:39,982 --> 00:16:41,942
You're darn right it was cool!

213
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:45,988
It all started a long time ago.

214
00:16:46,613 --> 00:16:48,240
Can we start not
so long ago, maybe?

215
00:16:48,448 --> 00:16:49,533
Do you want a tree?

216
00:16:49,783 --> 00:16:51,076
Yes, yes.

217
00:16:51,493 --> 00:16:56,790
Then it all started
a long, long time ago.

218
00:16:57,749 --> 00:17:00,460
<i>I was a young man leaving home.</i>

219
00:17:00,544 --> 00:17:04,172
Well, here I go, Mom. Off to
change the world with my Thneed.

220
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:07,759
I'm actually doing it!

221
00:17:07,843 --> 00:17:10,512
Yes, but just remember, Oncie,

222
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:13,432
if somehow your invention
ends up a failure

223
00:17:13,515 --> 00:17:15,684
instead of a success,

224
00:17:15,851 --> 00:17:18,228
oh, it wouldn't
surprise me at all!

225
00:17:20,147 --> 00:17:21,315
Nice wheels.

226
00:17:21,815 --> 00:17:22,899
Burn!

227
00:17:23,233 --> 00:17:25,068
Ow!

228
00:17:25,152 --> 00:17:26,320
Yeah, "Burn!"

229
00:17:26,486 --> 00:17:29,698
But you will see, okay? I'm
going to prove you all wrong.

230
00:17:29,823 --> 00:17:31,241
Come on, Melvin!

231
00:17:31,658 --> 00:17:34,202
<i>So, there I was
at the very bottom.</i>

232
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:36,580
<i>With nothing
but a wagon, a mule,</i>

233
00:17:36,872 --> 00:17:40,959
<i>and a completely irrational
sense of optimism.</i>

234
00:17:45,672 --> 00:17:47,049
<i>I was searching the globe,</i>

235
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:50,635
<i>obsessed with finding the
perfect material for my Thneed.</i>

236
00:17:53,013 --> 00:17:56,099
<i>But I'd had
absolutely no success.</i>

237
00:17:56,349 --> 00:18:01,146
<i>Until one day, I found paradise.</i>

238
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:02,355
Oh!

239
00:18:02,439 --> 00:18:04,816
We're going to be
there soon, I'm sure.

240
00:18:05,025 --> 00:18:06,109
Whoa!

241
00:18:15,202 --> 00:18:19,915
This is the most
beautiful place,

242
00:18:20,082 --> 00:18:22,000
okay, I have ever seen.

243
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:24,920
Oh.

244
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:26,546
Ta-da!

245
00:18:28,215 --> 00:18:29,299
Whoa!

246
00:19:00,747 --> 00:19:02,666
<i>Yeah</i>

247
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,709
<i>This is it</i>

248
00:19:07,087 --> 00:19:10,090
<i>This is the place</i>

249
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:15,095
<i>These Truff ula trees
are just what I need</i>

250
00:19:15,262 --> 00:19:20,267
<i>Gonna chop one down
and make my Thneed</i>

251
00:19:21,476 --> 00:19:23,144
<i>But first...</i>

252
00:19:27,607 --> 00:19:28,692
Now you!

253
00:19:31,361 --> 00:19:32,612
That's great!

254
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:46,585
<i>So now our friendship can begin</i>

255
00:19:46,668 --> 00:19:48,962
<i>Hand in hand, and wing and fin</i>

256
00:19:49,045 --> 00:19:51,715
<i>There's nothing
you and I can't do</i>

257
00:19:51,798 --> 00:19:54,759
<i>So let's all make
my dreams come true</i>

258
00:20:16,323 --> 00:20:17,657
Hey, guys!

259
00:20:18,158 --> 00:20:20,910
Come on, where is
my back-up chorus?

260
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:24,456
What?

261
00:20:25,999 --> 00:20:27,876
Ah-ha! Oh.

262
00:20:34,841 --> 00:20:36,217
Ooh!

263
00:21:04,788 --> 00:21:07,957
<i>Hey, hey, wait.
Wait a minute.</i>

264
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:09,250
Excuse me?

265
00:21:09,876 --> 00:21:11,920
Yeah, that's awesome.

266
00:21:12,087 --> 00:21:15,090
Feeding junk food to forest animals?
That's great.

267
00:21:15,423 --> 00:21:17,383
But, uh, is there
a musical number

268
00:21:17,467 --> 00:21:18,927
where you show me
how to get a tree?

269
00:21:19,135 --> 00:21:20,345
Because I would
love to hear that one.

270
00:21:20,595 --> 00:21:23,389
Oh, yes. Right after the
musical number about the kid

271
00:21:23,556 --> 00:21:25,308
who kept
interrupting the story,

272
00:21:25,391 --> 00:21:27,227
and was never heard from again.

273
00:21:27,811 --> 00:21:29,938
Right, got it. Proceed.

274
00:21:31,481 --> 00:21:33,316
All right, here we go.

275
00:21:33,483 --> 00:21:36,820
About to make a Thneed,
about to change the world.

276
00:22:09,269 --> 00:22:10,562
Check it out, guys...

277
00:22:12,021 --> 00:22:13,106
Where did everybody go?

278
00:22:19,737 --> 00:22:23,074
Little did I know that by
chopping down that tree

279
00:22:23,157 --> 00:22:28,079
I had just summoned a mystical
creature as old as time itself.

280
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:32,542
The legendary,
slightly annoying

281
00:22:32,709 --> 00:22:34,836
guardian of the forest.

282
00:22:35,628 --> 00:22:37,213
The Lorax.

283
00:24:34,789 --> 00:24:35,832
Hey!
Whoo!

284
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:38,668
Did you chop down this tree?

285
00:24:39,127 --> 00:24:41,129
Uh... No.

286
00:24:42,296 --> 00:24:43,506
Who did it?

287
00:24:43,798 --> 00:24:45,466
What's that?

288
00:24:47,135 --> 00:24:48,469
I think he did it.

289
00:24:50,805 --> 00:24:52,390
Leave!
Vacate the premises!

290
00:24:52,473 --> 00:24:54,600
Take your ax and get out!

291
00:24:54,767 --> 00:24:57,019
And who are you?

292
00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:01,315
I'm the Lorax!
Guardian of the forest.

293
00:25:01,482 --> 00:25:03,442
I speak for the trees.

294
00:25:05,153 --> 00:25:07,530
So you're telling me,
you just didn't see me

295
00:25:07,613 --> 00:25:09,490
magically appear
out of that stump?

296
00:25:09,657 --> 00:25:11,576
With all the lightning
and thunder and stuff.

297
00:25:11,659 --> 00:25:12,785
You didn't see any of that?

298
00:25:12,869 --> 00:25:15,746
No, but that sounds amazing.
Can I see some of that?

299
00:25:15,913 --> 00:25:19,876
Uh, yeah, I could show you.
But that's not how it works.

300
00:25:20,293 --> 00:25:21,335
Okay. Um...

301
00:25:21,878 --> 00:25:23,004
Didn't really happen.

302
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:25,756
Oh, I know what you want!

303
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:32,221
I've got one of these for the
cutest little guy lever saw!

304
00:25:32,388 --> 00:25:35,016
Yummy, yummy,
yummy, yummy, yummy...

305
00:25:35,308 --> 00:25:38,185
How dare you!
Give me that!

306
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:40,146
Mmm.

307
00:25:40,938 --> 00:25:42,356
I'm going to eat this,

308
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,650
but I am highly offended by it.

309
00:25:50,072 --> 00:25:53,868
What are you... Hey, Mustache!
Will you stop that?

310
00:25:55,369 --> 00:25:57,079
What's your deal, man?

311
00:25:57,204 --> 00:25:59,498
Pull them right out Time
for you to go, Beanpole!

312
00:25:59,707 --> 00:26:01,834
Just going to put them right back in.
We can do this all day.

313
00:26:08,049 --> 00:26:09,425
Stop right there! Stop it!

314
00:26:10,926 --> 00:26:15,931
So you would hammer one of
nature's innocent creatures?

315
00:26:17,516 --> 00:26:18,684
What? No!

316
00:26:18,934 --> 00:26:21,687
I would never hit this little guy.
You, on the other hand,

317
00:26:21,979 --> 00:26:23,189
I would gladly pound you

318
00:26:23,272 --> 00:26:25,066
and your mustache
into the ground!

319
00:26:25,232 --> 00:26:30,029
Behold! The intruder
and his violent ways.

320
00:26:30,112 --> 00:26:33,199
Shame on you.
For shame!

321
00:26:34,408 --> 00:26:36,369
All right, you know what?
That's it!

322
00:26:36,452 --> 00:26:38,371
You listen to me,
you furry meatloaf.

323
00:26:38,454 --> 00:26:40,998
I'm going to chop down as
many trees as I need. Okay?

324
00:26:41,082 --> 00:26:43,417
Newsflash!
Not going anywhere!

325
00:26:44,794 --> 00:26:46,545
End of story.

326
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,839
Then you leave me no choice.

327
00:26:51,967 --> 00:26:56,138
If you're not gone by the time
the sun sets on this valley,

328
00:26:56,222 --> 00:27:00,476
all the forces of nature
will be unleashed upon you

329
00:27:00,768 --> 00:27:05,106
and curse you until
the end of your days!

330
00:27:05,272 --> 00:27:09,110
You have been warned.

331
00:27:15,908 --> 00:27:17,451
Thanks.
Yeah, okay.

332
00:27:17,535 --> 00:27:19,912
You have been warned.

333
00:27:20,871 --> 00:27:23,207
But I didn't listen
to his warning.

334
00:27:23,374 --> 00:27:25,626
And you won't believe
what happened that night.

335
00:27:25,709 --> 00:27:26,752
What?

336
00:27:26,836 --> 00:27:29,004
If you want to hear more,
come back tomorrow.

337
00:27:29,588 --> 00:27:31,590
Hey, wait, wait! Tomorrow?

338
00:27:31,674 --> 00:27:32,967
Whoa!

339
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:34,760
Whoa-ho-ho.

340
00:27:34,844 --> 00:27:35,970
Are you serious right now?

341
00:27:36,053 --> 00:27:38,681
Ah! You live in
the middle of nowhere!

342
00:27:38,973 --> 00:27:41,350
It stinks out here.
Don't make me come back!

343
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,061
I guess you don't really want
to hear the rest of the story.

344
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:50,985
No, no.

345
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,029
I do. I really do. I want to
hear the story. I just...

346
00:27:54,113 --> 00:27:57,116
Nah! You don't have
what it takes. Goodbye.

347
00:27:57,366 --> 00:27:59,827
Wait, wait!
I have what it takes.

348
00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:05,666
It's all right. It's
okay, I'll come back.

349
00:28:05,749 --> 00:28:06,917
It's no problem.

350
00:28:07,084 --> 00:28:10,921
See, here I am, leaving.
Walking away now.

351
00:28:11,213 --> 00:28:12,548
I'll see you tomorrow.

352
00:28:13,299 --> 00:28:14,383
Mmm.

353
00:28:15,176 --> 00:28:18,387
Maybe. Just maybe.

354
00:28:27,855 --> 00:28:29,315
What did you wish for, Audrey?

355
00:28:29,565 --> 00:28:30,774
Well, I would love to tell you,

356
00:28:30,858 --> 00:28:34,820
but, sadly, according to the
universal wish laws, I cannot.

357
00:28:36,447 --> 00:28:38,282
I know what she wished for.

358
00:28:50,461 --> 00:28:52,171
Was it, perhaps...

359
00:28:53,756 --> 00:28:55,174
This?

360
00:29:03,849 --> 00:29:05,851
Ted, you didn't.

361
00:29:05,935 --> 00:29:09,146
Oh, no. I totally did.

362
00:29:09,313 --> 00:29:12,191
Happy birthday, Audrey.

363
00:29:13,275 --> 00:29:15,110
Kiss him! Kiss him!

364
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:29,416
Ted.

365
00:29:29,541 --> 00:29:30,876
Ted. Tedster.
Huh!

366
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,213
You're kissing the
cereal again, hon. What?

367
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:37,216
I just...
I like this cereal.

368
00:29:37,299 --> 00:29:38,509
What one is this?
Yeah!

369
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:40,260
Okay.

370
00:29:40,427 --> 00:29:43,055
Well, I'll make sure to buy
extra next time for you.

371
00:29:43,305 --> 00:29:45,974
All right, cool. Hey, I got to run.
I got to go do athing.

372
00:29:46,058 --> 00:29:47,726
So, I'll see you guys.

373
00:29:47,976 --> 00:29:49,895
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

374
00:29:49,978 --> 00:29:51,772
You're not going
anywhere, young man.

375
00:29:51,939 --> 00:29:54,233
It's Sunday. You
know what that means?

376
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,319
Family time, and we're
all playing board games!

377
00:29:57,403 --> 00:29:58,529
But...

378
00:30:00,572 --> 00:30:01,657
Hmm.

379
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,117
Mmm?

380
00:30:03,617 --> 00:30:04,952
Oh, man.

381
00:30:05,202 --> 00:30:06,912
Mom, seriously every turn?

382
00:30:06,995 --> 00:30:08,664
Hey, back off!

383
00:30:10,165 --> 00:30:11,417
Ooh!

384
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,712
No.
Okay! Family time is over.

385
00:30:14,837 --> 00:30:18,048
It is now personal time.
I'll be in my room.

386
00:30:19,466 --> 00:30:21,885
Okay, dear. Have fun.

387
00:30:24,638 --> 00:30:26,849
I knew I could break her.

388
00:30:27,057 --> 00:30:28,142
Go.
Huh?

389
00:30:28,225 --> 00:30:29,393
Go see him!

390
00:30:29,476 --> 00:30:30,811
Oh, yeah!

391
00:30:32,729 --> 00:30:35,274
You rule!
Thank you, Grammy.

392
00:30:40,112 --> 00:30:41,196
Whoa!

393
00:30:55,794 --> 00:30:57,713
Hey! Ted, right?

394
00:30:58,922 --> 00:31:01,300
Um, Mr. O'Hare?

395
00:31:01,467 --> 00:31:04,678
So, I hear you have
become interested in trees.

396
00:31:04,845 --> 00:31:06,513
What's that all about?

397
00:31:07,097 --> 00:31:08,182
Oh. Um...

398
00:31:09,183 --> 00:31:10,559
Where did you hear that?

399
00:31:10,642 --> 00:31:11,727
Oh.

400
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:13,562
Teddy, there's not much
that goes on in Thneedville

401
00:31:13,645 --> 00:31:15,439
that I don't know about.

402
00:31:15,522 --> 00:31:19,359
Here's the deal, I make a living
selling fresh air to people.

403
00:31:19,526 --> 00:31:22,070
Trees?
They make it for free.

404
00:31:22,237 --> 00:31:24,990
So, when I hear
people talking about them,

405
00:31:25,073 --> 00:31:28,577
I consider it kind of
a threat to my business.

406
00:31:29,411 --> 00:31:31,455
I don't even know
what you're talking about.

407
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,582
You listen to me, boy.

408
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:37,252
Don't go poking around in
things you don't understand

409
00:31:37,419 --> 00:31:39,504
or I'll be your
worst nightmare.

410
00:31:39,671 --> 00:31:42,507
I'm Frankenstein's head
on a spider's body!

411
00:31:43,467 --> 00:31:44,760
Yeah, um...

412
00:31:45,886 --> 00:31:47,888
Okay, my mom is expecting me.
So, I'm just going to...

413
00:31:48,722 --> 00:31:52,809
Of course, of course. Now, go
back to your family game time.

414
00:31:53,435 --> 00:31:55,687
Grandma just finished her turn.

415
00:31:56,605 --> 00:31:57,731
How did you know?

416
00:31:58,649 --> 00:32:00,567
Please. I have
eyes everywhere.

417
00:32:05,739 --> 00:32:06,782
Huh!

418
00:32:06,865 --> 00:32:09,326
You got a beautiful
town here, Ted.

419
00:32:09,409 --> 00:32:12,913
Lots of fun stuff to occupy
your short attention span.

420
00:32:13,163 --> 00:32:15,165
Why, I can't
think of any reason

421
00:32:15,332 --> 00:32:20,045
you would ever want to
go outside of town again.

422
00:32:20,128 --> 00:32:21,213
Ever.

423
00:32:26,885 --> 00:32:31,098
Okay! Good talk.
Really good talk.

424
00:32:56,456 --> 00:32:57,499
Oh, no.

425
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,543
Look out!

426
00:33:02,838 --> 00:33:06,383
Hey, man? You know, you need
to change that door bell.

427
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:09,219
Oh, you missed me.
What?

428
00:33:09,553 --> 00:33:13,682
You're already back. Clearly,
you missed me a little. Right?

429
00:33:13,974 --> 00:33:17,728
No, I didn't. I'm just here
to hear the end of the story.

430
00:33:17,811 --> 00:33:19,521
Why are you so interested
in trees anyway?

431
00:33:19,604 --> 00:33:21,064
Why aren't you like other kids,

432
00:33:21,148 --> 00:33:23,483
break dancing and
wearing bell-bottoms,

433
00:33:23,567 --> 00:33:25,736
and playing the Donkey Kongs?

434
00:33:25,819 --> 00:33:29,573
Yeah, right, right.
I don't know.

435
00:33:30,073 --> 00:33:34,327
Uh, I just thought it would be kind
of cool to have one, you know?

436
00:33:34,536 --> 00:33:35,704
Huh?

437
00:33:35,787 --> 00:33:37,330
It's a girl, isn't it?

438
00:33:37,664 --> 00:33:39,332
What? No!

439
00:33:39,666 --> 00:33:42,335
Really? Because when a guy
does something stupid once,

440
00:33:42,419 --> 00:33:44,045
well, that's because
he's a guy.

441
00:33:44,129 --> 00:33:46,673
But if he does
the same stupid thing twice,

442
00:33:46,756 --> 00:33:49,509
it's usually to
impress some girl.

443
00:33:49,801 --> 00:33:51,511
Hey, she is not some girl!

444
00:33:51,595 --> 00:33:54,639
She's a woman, in high school.

445
00:33:54,806 --> 00:33:57,893
And she loves trees.
And I'm going to get her one.

446
00:33:58,101 --> 00:33:59,311
Aw!

447
00:33:59,394 --> 00:34:03,398
How nice to see someone so
undeterred by things like reality.

448
00:34:03,523 --> 00:34:04,608
Thank you.

449
00:34:04,691 --> 00:34:06,610
All right,
but where did we leave off?

450
00:34:28,089 --> 00:34:30,467
Now that's a Thneed.

451
00:34:30,634 --> 00:34:33,386
Nothing unmanly
about knitting. No, sir.

452
00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:56,743
Look at that...

453
00:34:58,078 --> 00:34:59,120
Oh!

454
00:34:59,204 --> 00:35:01,206
Who taught you guys
how to steal a bed?

455
00:35:06,503 --> 00:35:07,754
Shh!

456
00:35:27,524 --> 00:35:29,609
Okay, nice and easy.

457
00:35:36,616 --> 00:35:39,786
Nice work, you guys. Couldn't
have done it without you.

458
00:35:42,288 --> 00:35:45,625
You got to be kidding me.
Can he swim?

459
00:35:46,418 --> 00:35:47,585
Of course he can't swim!

460
00:35:47,877 --> 00:35:50,547
Hang on, Pipsqueak!
I'm coming to get you!

461
00:35:55,677 --> 00:35:57,721
Hey, you fishies!
Stop that bed!

462
00:36:02,392 --> 00:36:04,019
Whoo! Whoo!

463
00:36:09,065 --> 00:36:10,525
Jump, jump!

464
00:36:11,109 --> 00:36:12,944
Come on, get up there.
Come on.

465
00:36:13,361 --> 00:36:15,989
Go, go! A little bit more!
A little bit more!

466
00:36:18,867 --> 00:36:20,201
Now what?

467
00:36:21,911 --> 00:36:23,121
Mmm-mmm.

468
00:36:24,247 --> 00:36:25,749
Get up there.

469
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,003
Okay, Pipsqueak,
give me your hand.

470
00:36:30,086 --> 00:36:31,129
Come on,
reach out for the Lorax.

471
00:36:34,966 --> 00:36:36,217
Where did you go?

472
00:36:39,512 --> 00:36:40,764
Bar-ba-loots.

473
00:36:49,439 --> 00:36:50,565
Oh, that's bad.

474
00:36:55,111 --> 00:36:56,613
Hey, Beanpole, wake up!

475
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,041
What's happening?
Where am I?

476
00:37:08,124 --> 00:37:11,544
Hey! We got trouble,
and it's coming up fast!

477
00:37:14,214 --> 00:37:15,256
Whoo!

478
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,841
We're in a river!

479
00:37:35,276 --> 00:37:36,319
Whew!

480
00:37:40,573 --> 00:37:41,741
Oh, no.

481
00:37:44,953 --> 00:37:46,412
Just do something!

482
00:37:47,539 --> 00:37:49,123
Help is on the way!

483
00:37:52,168 --> 00:37:53,795
No, no!

484
00:37:55,421 --> 00:37:56,673
Just a minute!

485
00:38:18,152 --> 00:38:19,237
Oh, no!

486
00:38:22,991 --> 00:38:24,284
Wake up! Wake up!

487
00:38:25,326 --> 00:38:27,453
Yuck!

488
00:38:32,583 --> 00:38:33,710
Clear!

489
00:38:33,793 --> 00:38:35,003
Ah!

490
00:38:38,047 --> 00:38:39,590
I was heading into the light,

491
00:38:39,674 --> 00:38:41,592
and you pulled me
right back and here I am!

492
00:38:41,884 --> 00:38:43,219
You saved my life!

493
00:38:43,303 --> 00:38:46,222
Yeah, I know. Well, no,
it's not that big a deal.

494
00:38:46,306 --> 00:38:47,473
It is a big deal!

495
00:38:47,682 --> 00:38:51,728
Look, I almost went over
that waterfall! Wait...

496
00:38:52,437 --> 00:38:55,189
On my bed. How did my
bed get in the river?

497
00:38:55,314 --> 00:38:57,984
Uh... About that...

498
00:38:58,735 --> 00:39:02,655
Actually... I put your
bed in the water.

499
00:39:03,364 --> 00:39:04,866
I didn't mean you any harm.

500
00:39:04,949 --> 00:39:07,452
I just wanted to
calmly float you away.

501
00:39:08,453 --> 00:39:10,913
Look, everyone here
needs the trees

502
00:39:10,997 --> 00:39:13,124
and you're chopping them down!

503
00:39:13,833 --> 00:39:17,211
So, we've got a big problem.

504
00:39:23,342 --> 00:39:24,427
All right, look.

505
00:39:24,594 --> 00:39:28,931
I hereby swear that I will
never chop down another tree.

506
00:39:30,016 --> 00:39:31,559
I promise.

507
00:39:32,101 --> 00:39:35,313
Thank you. But I'm going
to keep my eye on you.

508
00:39:35,772 --> 00:39:37,815
Good. Now, I've got
a big day tomorrow

509
00:39:37,899 --> 00:39:39,734
so I'm going to get some sleep.

510
00:39:42,737 --> 00:39:44,947
Right after I find my bed.

511
00:40:05,802 --> 00:40:06,844
Ow!

512
00:40:06,928 --> 00:40:09,096
Okay, what are you...

513
00:40:10,807 --> 00:40:12,850
Question, what are
they doing here?

514
00:40:13,476 --> 00:40:17,688
And follow up, if I may,
what are you doing here?

515
00:40:18,564 --> 00:40:20,775
Well, after
the incident last night,

516
00:40:20,983 --> 00:40:23,611
we found one of your socks
and came here to return it.

517
00:40:23,945 --> 00:40:26,364
But when we got here,
you were asleep. What?

518
00:40:26,739 --> 00:40:27,907
Ew!

519
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:30,451
Exactly. And sleeping
is the body's way

520
00:40:30,535 --> 00:40:32,870
of telling
other people to go away.

521
00:40:33,037 --> 00:40:35,957
I know, but you looked so cozy.

522
00:40:36,123 --> 00:40:39,961
And it was cold outside, and we
just fell asleep. No harm done.

523
00:40:40,044 --> 00:40:43,422
"No harm done"?
"No harm done"? Okay.

524
00:40:44,549 --> 00:40:48,261
Okay, I put my lips on those.
Well, I used to, anyway.

525
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,806
Ew.

526
00:40:51,889 --> 00:40:54,225
Did you just...
In my bowl!

527
00:40:57,770 --> 00:40:59,146
Why do you have one of these?

528
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:01,566
You don't even have a mustache.

529
00:41:03,276 --> 00:41:04,777
Okay, that's it!

530
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:06,862
What? I thought
we made a deal last night.

531
00:41:07,196 --> 00:41:08,239
Yes, we did.

532
00:41:08,322 --> 00:41:10,700
And I said I wouldn't
chop down any more trees.

533
00:41:10,783 --> 00:41:12,827
And I said I was going
to keep an eye on you.

534
00:41:12,994 --> 00:41:14,996
I'm starving.
What's for breakfast?

535
00:41:17,707 --> 00:41:19,125
Breakfast is overrated.

536
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:24,297
You know what?
I got work to do. Yeah.

537
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:28,718
I got to go into town
and sell my Thneed.

538
00:41:29,969 --> 00:41:31,595
You chopped down
one of my trees

539
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:33,431
to make that piece of garbage?

540
00:41:33,597 --> 00:41:34,682
Look at that...

541
00:41:35,016 --> 00:41:39,395
"Garbage"? Oh, no.
Oh, no! You do not get it.

542
00:41:39,645 --> 00:41:42,023
This is a revolutionary product

543
00:41:42,106 --> 00:41:44,483
that will change
the world as we know it.

544
00:41:45,151 --> 00:41:46,527
It has a million uses!

545
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:50,323
Look at this.
It's a swimsuit!

546
00:41:50,531 --> 00:41:52,992
Mud tracked all over your
floor by uninvited guests?

547
00:41:53,159 --> 00:41:56,120
Well, the Thneed sure
comes in handy for that!

548
00:41:57,330 --> 00:41:58,622
But wait, there's more!

549
00:41:58,789 --> 00:42:00,374
Thanks to its
all-natural microfibers,

550
00:42:00,458 --> 00:42:02,918
the Thneed is
super-absorbent!

551
00:42:03,085 --> 00:42:04,587
It also works as a hat.

552
00:42:06,172 --> 00:42:07,673
Of course, you probably
want to wring it out first.

553
00:42:07,882 --> 00:42:09,967
Go ahead, knock yourself out.

554
00:42:10,843 --> 00:42:12,678
But nobody is going
to buy that thing.

555
00:42:12,762 --> 00:42:14,305
Good to know.

556
00:42:14,388 --> 00:42:18,851
Well, fortunately, you are not
the target market, weirdo.

557
00:42:19,018 --> 00:42:20,436
You're bringing a guitar?

558
00:42:20,561 --> 00:42:22,396
Oh, yeah.
I got a little jingle.

559
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,107
I'm gonna blow some minds,
gonna sell some Thneeds!

560
00:42:25,191 --> 00:42:26,275
Yeah.

561
00:42:28,444 --> 00:42:31,989
<i>Everybody needs a Thneed</i>

562
00:42:32,073 --> 00:42:34,658
<i>A fine thing that all people...</i>

563
00:42:36,035 --> 00:42:37,703
Sit down, go on.

564
00:42:38,162 --> 00:42:40,664
Unfortunately, I didn't
sell it the first day.

565
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:42,708
<i>The Thneed is good</i>

566
00:42:42,958 --> 00:42:44,877
<i>The Thneed is great...</i>

567
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,087
Hey!

568
00:42:49,632 --> 00:42:50,966
Or the second day.

569
00:42:52,343 --> 00:42:53,427
Hey!

570
00:42:53,511 --> 00:42:56,180
<i>Or the third,
or fourth, or fifth day.</i>

571
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:59,433
Okay, that one
hit the tender spot.

572
00:43:00,643 --> 00:43:01,685
<i>Until finally...</i>

573
00:43:01,769 --> 00:43:03,312
That's it!
You know what?

574
00:43:03,395 --> 00:43:05,856
I'm done with this thing.

575
00:43:06,232 --> 00:43:07,691
Aw.

576
00:43:08,192 --> 00:43:10,152
My family was right.
I quit!

577
00:43:18,953 --> 00:43:20,621
Hey. Cool hat.

578
00:43:20,913 --> 00:43:23,249
Oh, my gosh!
I totally want one.

579
00:43:23,415 --> 00:43:25,751
That thing makes me
like you more.

580
00:43:34,844 --> 00:43:37,137
Hey! Where's your Thneed,
did you sell it?

581
00:43:37,346 --> 00:43:40,224
Hey. No, no.
Didn't sell it.

582
00:43:40,558 --> 00:43:43,102
Turns out, it's ahead
of its time, I guess.

583
00:43:43,185 --> 00:43:46,605
Hey, you gave it your best shot.
Right? What more can you do?

584
00:43:46,689 --> 00:43:48,691
Come on, take a seat,
we'll deal you in.

585
00:43:49,358 --> 00:43:50,442
What are we playing?

586
00:43:50,526 --> 00:43:54,280
I'm playing poker. He's playing Go Fish.
And I think he's hungry.

587
00:43:55,823 --> 00:43:56,949
Oh.

588
00:44:00,661 --> 00:44:02,162
<i>Pancake, the pancake</i>

589
00:44:04,039 --> 00:44:05,165
Up!

00:44:09,128 --> 00:44:11,422
Who is up for ninths?

591
00:44:12,047 --> 00:44:14,383
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

592
00:44:15,551 --> 00:44:16,719
Whoa!

593
00:44:16,802 --> 00:44:18,345
All right, pass them over.

594
00:44:18,596 --> 00:44:19,930
Yeah, see?

595
00:44:20,347 --> 00:44:22,016
What's going on?

596
00:44:30,357 --> 00:44:32,943
Oh, no.
That's a lot of people.

00:44:40,409 --> 00:44:43,704
<i>Everybody needs a Thneed</i>

<i>It's a tightrope for an acrobat</i>

603
00:45:04,308 --> 00:45:07,936
<i>A net for catching butterflies</i>

604
00:45:08,228 --> 00:45:13,025

<i>We need a Thneed</i>

610
00:45:30,167 --> 00:45:34,421
Mom? Hey, it's me! I told you
I was going to be a success!

611
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:37,341
You need to bring the whole
family here right now.

612
00:45:37,424 --> 00:45:39,551
We're going to be rich!

613
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:44,681
What? I'm going to need all the
help I can get. Don't worry.

614
00:45:45,766 --> 00:45:48,519
So, has he told you
how to get a tree yet?

615
00:45:48,811 --> 00:45:50,312
Actually, no.

616
00:45:50,395 --> 00:45:53,899
But I think he's going to get
to that part really soon.

617
00:45:54,942 --> 00:45:56,944
Here we are.
What?

618
00:45:57,736 --> 00:45:58,946
I'll just be a minute.

619
00:46:01,698 --> 00:46:03,867
Oh, wow. Hey, Audrey!

620
00:46:04,618 --> 00:46:06,537
Oh, hi, Ted! What's up?

621
00:46:06,829 --> 00:46:09,915
You know me, just cruising.
Putting out the vibe.

622
00:46:09,998 --> 00:46:11,917
Just me and my thoughts.

623
00:46:13,168 --> 00:46:15,546
Oh, is this the girl
you're always talking about?

624
00:46:15,629 --> 00:46:17,089
Grandma!
Stop making things up.

625
00:46:17,172 --> 00:46:19,842
She's even prettier than...
Okay, got to run! Bye.

626
00:46:22,344 --> 00:46:25,097
Okay, Grammy,
let's get you home!

627
00:46:56,503 --> 00:46:57,629
Yeah!

628
00:46:59,715 --> 00:47:00,799
Whoa!

629
00:47:00,883 --> 00:47:02,885
I'm so sorry. So sorry.

630
00:47:04,219 --> 00:47:05,304
Did not wanna see that.

631
00:47:05,470 --> 00:47:06,597
Whoa!

632
00:47:10,517 --> 00:47:11,768
Whoa!

633
00:47:15,606 --> 00:47:16,940
Whoa-ho-ho!

634
00:47:23,530 --> 00:47:24,698
Hey!

635
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:31,246
Hey, I'm back.

636
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:32,664
What have you got there?

637
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,124
Yes!

638
00:47:37,628 --> 00:47:38,795
Whoa!

639
00:47:41,632 --> 00:47:43,050
Thank you, Ted.

640
00:47:46,595 --> 00:47:47,638
Now, picture this.

641
00:47:48,305 --> 00:47:53,268
<i>Sun shining,
a blue sky, a perfect day.</i>

642
00:47:57,272 --> 00:48:00,150
<i>It was all downhill from there.</i>

643
00:48:17,876 --> 00:48:19,127
Whoa!

644
00:48:32,224 --> 00:48:33,934
What a dump.

645
00:48:34,101 --> 00:48:36,311
Hey, Aunt Grizelda!

646
00:48:38,188 --> 00:48:40,232
Hey, Chet, check this out!

647
00:48:40,315 --> 00:48:41,358
Go long!

648
00:48:42,067 --> 00:48:43,944
No, Brett,
that's actually not a...

649
00:48:44,027 --> 00:48:45,070
Okay.

650
00:48:45,153 --> 00:48:46,822
Go long! Go long!

651
00:48:46,905 --> 00:48:48,365
I got it! I got it!

652
00:48:51,118 --> 00:48:52,160
Got it!

653
00:48:53,495 --> 00:48:55,622
He totally ran into that tree!

654
00:48:56,373 --> 00:48:57,457
Ow!

655
00:48:58,458 --> 00:49:00,460
Oncie, is that you?

656
00:49:00,544 --> 00:49:01,837
Mom!

657
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:06,633
There he is! There's my big,
suddenly successful son!

658
00:49:08,593 --> 00:49:11,346
We always knew you would
make it, Oncie. Right?

659
00:49:12,055 --> 00:49:14,474
Hey! I love this guy!

660
00:49:14,850 --> 00:49:17,894
But you always said I wouldn't
amount to anything, remember?

661
00:49:18,103 --> 00:49:20,981
Hush your mouth. I was just
trying to motivate you!

662
00:49:21,189 --> 00:49:23,024
I am really glad
that you clarified that

663
00:49:23,108 --> 00:49:26,111
because it actually hurt my
feelings for a really long time.

664
00:49:26,736 --> 00:49:30,532
Anyway, you're all here, you all
work for me, and that's cool.

665
00:49:30,615 --> 00:49:32,033
So, let's get to work.

666
00:49:32,701 --> 00:49:34,703
Brett, Chet, set up the RV!

667
00:49:34,786 --> 00:49:37,247
Would you stop
throwing that bear?

668
00:50:06,818 --> 00:50:10,697
Time out. Back up. Stop. Don't move an inch.
Nobody's moving in here.

669
00:50:10,864 --> 00:50:11,990
You got to go. Goodbye.

670
00:50:12,324 --> 00:50:15,619
So, who invited
the giant, furry peanut?

671
00:50:15,744 --> 00:50:16,912
You calling me a peanut, huh?

672
00:50:16,995 --> 00:50:18,246
I'll go right up your nose!

673
00:50:19,372 --> 00:50:20,874
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

674
00:50:20,957 --> 00:50:22,042
You wouldn't hit a woman.

675
00:50:22,876 --> 00:50:24,377
That's a woman?

676
00:50:24,753 --> 00:50:27,172
Okay.
Everyone, cool it.

677
00:50:27,255 --> 00:50:29,424
Let's not get off
on the wrong foot here.

678
00:50:29,507 --> 00:50:32,677
Um, family, this is my friend...
Acquaintance.

679
00:50:32,761 --> 00:50:36,556
Yeah, acquaintance. Very good
acquaintance, the Lorax.

680
00:50:36,723 --> 00:50:39,267
He speaks for the trees.
That's right.

681
00:50:39,434 --> 00:50:42,145
And on behalf
of the trees, get out!

682
00:50:43,438 --> 00:50:48,068
Will you just be nice!
This is my family.

683
00:50:48,193 --> 00:50:49,235
And I'm going to
need their help

684
00:50:49,319 --> 00:50:51,655
if my company is
going to get bigger. Okay?

685
00:50:51,905 --> 00:50:53,031
Bigger?

686
00:50:53,281 --> 00:50:56,534
Yeah, this isn't some
rinky-dink operation any more.

687
00:50:56,701 --> 00:50:58,870
I got plans. Big plans!

688
00:50:59,037 --> 00:51:03,667
A vision of a world filled with Thneeds.
It's going to be huge!

689
00:51:05,752 --> 00:51:07,170
Which way does a tree fall?

690
00:51:07,712 --> 00:51:09,172
Uh, down?

691
00:51:09,923 --> 00:51:12,217
A tree falls the way it leans.

692
00:51:12,884 --> 00:51:15,512
Be careful which way you lean.

693
00:51:25,772 --> 00:51:28,608
I mean, look at this.
It's amazing.

694
00:51:29,442 --> 00:51:31,444
I am so proud of me.

695
00:51:32,028 --> 00:51:35,323
Oncie, we've got us
a little problem.

696
00:51:35,782 --> 00:51:36,866
Problem?

697
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:38,159
Mmm-hmm.

698
00:51:38,243 --> 00:51:41,413
See, we're not making
Thneeds fast enough.

699
00:51:41,621 --> 00:51:44,958
Harvesting the tufts
takes too long!

700
00:51:53,049 --> 00:51:54,884
Well, what else can we do?

701
00:51:55,051 --> 00:51:59,222
Well, and this just came to me,

702
00:51:59,389 --> 00:52:02,475
we could always start
chopping down the trees.

703
00:52:03,101 --> 00:52:04,269
What?

704
00:52:04,519 --> 00:52:07,313
Now you're thinking.
That would speed things up!

705
00:52:07,605 --> 00:52:09,107
But...
No "but" s, Oncie.

706
00:52:09,190 --> 00:52:10,650
You're running a business now.

707
00:52:10,859 --> 00:52:12,610
You have to do what's
best for the company,

708
00:52:12,694 --> 00:52:14,237
and your momma.

709
00:52:15,905 --> 00:52:20,034
Well, I guess it couldn't hurt
to chop down a few trees.

710
00:52:21,411 --> 00:52:24,581
You've made me so proud, Oncie.
Come here!

711
00:52:24,831 --> 00:52:27,458
Hey! I love this guy!

712
00:52:37,218 --> 00:52:40,597
No! No, no, no!
Stop it! Please, stop.

713
00:52:41,139 --> 00:52:43,892
Take that, you stupid tree!

714
00:52:49,147 --> 00:52:51,191
Where do you
think you're going?

715
00:52:51,816 --> 00:52:54,611
Excuse me, sir. I need
to talk with your boss.

716
00:52:55,987 --> 00:52:57,989
Oh, I'm sorry,

717
00:52:58,156 --> 00:53:01,451
but Mr. Once-ler's
not seeing anyone right now.

718
00:53:01,534 --> 00:53:02,827
Yeah, well,
he'll see me. So...

719
00:53:02,911 --> 00:53:04,412
Hey, keep your paws off me!

720
00:53:04,579 --> 00:53:06,497
Give me a reason, Shorty.

721
00:53:06,581 --> 00:53:08,291
Hey, you broke your promise.

722
00:53:08,374 --> 00:53:09,751
You're better than this.

723
00:53:09,959 --> 00:53:12,670
You gotta stop!
This is bad!

724
00:53:13,046 --> 00:53:15,632
Have a nice day!

725
00:53:19,218 --> 00:53:20,261
Bad?

726
00:53:20,428 --> 00:53:23,765
I'm not bad, I'm the good guy here.
He just doesn't get it.

727
00:53:24,307 --> 00:53:25,808
Do you think I'm bad?

728
00:53:26,142 --> 00:53:27,435
Thank you!

729
00:53:27,518 --> 00:53:30,438
I mean, something good
finally happens to me,

730
00:53:30,521 --> 00:53:33,733
and he just has to come along
and rain on my parade.

731
00:53:33,983 --> 00:53:35,360
What's his problem?

732
00:53:35,985 --> 00:53:37,111
See?

733
00:53:40,239 --> 00:53:42,492
Yeah, bad! Right.

734
00:53:54,087 --> 00:53:56,756
<i>How bad can I be?</i>

735
00:53:56,839 --> 00:53:58,925
<i>I'm just doin'
what comes naturally</i>

736
00:53:59,008 --> 00:54:01,427
<i>How bad can I be?</i>

737
00:54:01,761 --> 00:54:03,846
<i>I'm just following my destiny</i>

738
00:54:03,930 --> 00:54:06,391
<i>How bad can I be?</i>

739
00:54:06,474 --> 00:54:08,768
<i>I'm just doin'
what comes naturally</i>

740
00:54:08,851 --> 00:54:11,187
<i>How bad can I be?</i>

741
00:54:11,270 --> 00:54:13,314
<i>How bad can I possibly be?</i>

742
00:54:13,564 --> 00:54:14,816
<i>Well, there's
a principle in nature</i>

743
00:54:14,899 --> 00:54:16,150
<i>Principle in nature</i>

744
00:54:16,234 --> 00:54:18,277
<i>That almost
every creature knows</i>

745
00:54:18,569 --> 00:54:19,737
<i>Called survival of the fittest</i>

746
00:54:19,821 --> 00:54:20,988
<i>Survival of the fittest</i>

747
00:54:21,072 --> 00:54:23,658
<i>And check it,
this is how it goes</i>

748
00:54:23,741 --> 00:54:25,952
<i>The animal that wins
gotta scratch and fight</i>

749
00:54:26,035 --> 00:54:28,162
<i>And claw and bite and punch</i>

750
00:54:28,413 --> 00:54:30,832
<i>And the animal that doesn't
Well, the animal that doesn't</i>

751
00:54:30,915 --> 00:54:35,670
<i>Winds up someone else's
La-la-la-la lunch</i>

752
00:54:36,045 --> 00:54:38,131
<i>Munch, munch, munch, munch,
munch I'm just sayin'</i>

753
00:54:38,214 --> 00:54:40,800
<i>How bad can I be?</i>

754
00:54:40,967 --> 00:54:43,094
<i>I'm just doin'
what comes naturally</i>

755
00:54:43,177 --> 00:54:45,596
<i>How bad can I be?</i>

756
00:54:45,847 --> 00:54:47,932
<i>I'm just following my destiny</i>

757
00:54:48,015 --> 00:54:50,685
<i>How bad can I be?</i>

758
00:54:50,768 --> 00:54:52,895
<i>I'm just doin'
what comes naturally</i>

759
00:54:52,979 --> 00:54:55,314
<i>How bad can I be?</i>

760
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,650
<i>How bad can I possibly be?</i>

761
00:54:57,733 --> 00:54:59,193
<i>There's a principle in business</i>

762
00:54:59,277 --> 00:55:00,319
<i>Principle in business</i>

763
00:55:00,403 --> 00:55:02,363
<i>That everybody knows is sound</i>

764
00:55:02,613 --> 00:55:05,428
<i>It says the people with the
money People with the money</i>

765
00:55:05,441 --> 00:55:07,452
<i>Make this
ever-loving world go round</i>

766
00:55:07,577 --> 00:55:10,479
<i>So I'm biggering my company
I'm biggering my factory</i>

767
00:55:10,483 --> 00:55:11,772
<i>I'm biggering my corporate sign</i>

768
00:55:11,776 --> 00:55:12,540
<i>Bigger, bigger!</i>

769
00:55:12,623 --> 00:55:15,726
<i>Everybody out there
You take care of yours</i>

770
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:20,047
<i>I'll take care of
mine-mine-mine-mine-mine</i>

771
00:55:20,131 --> 00:55:21,424
<i>Shake that bottom line</i>

772
00:55:21,549 --> 00:55:23,509
<i>Let me hear you
say Smogulous Smoke!</i>

773
00:55:23,593 --> 00:55:24,760
<i>Smogulous Smoke!</i>

774
00:55:24,886 --> 00:55:27,138
<i>Schloppity-Schlopp!</i>

775
00:55:27,221 --> 00:55:30,475
<i>Complain all you want It's never,
ever, ever, ever gonna stop</i>

776
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:31,976
<i>Stop!</i>

777
00:55:32,059 --> 00:55:34,562
<i>Come on,
how bad can I possibly be?</i>

778
00:55:34,645 --> 00:55:37,064
<i>How bad can I be?</i>

779
00:55:37,356 --> 00:55:39,442
<i>I'm just building the economy</i>

780
00:55:39,525 --> 00:55:42,153
<i>How bad can I be?</i>

781
00:55:42,236 --> 00:55:44,322
<i>Just look at me
petting this puppy</i>

782
00:55:44,405 --> 00:55:46,782
<i>How bad can I be?</i>

783
00:55:46,866 --> 00:55:49,285
<i>A portion of proceeds
goes to charity</i>

784
00:55:49,368 --> 00:55:51,662
<i>How bad can I be?</i>

785
00:55:51,746 --> 00:55:54,707
<i>How bad could I possibly be?
Let's see!</i>

786
00:55:56,626 --> 00:55:59,212
<i>All the customers are buying</i>

787
00:56:01,547 --> 00:56:04,300
<i>And the money's multiplying</i>

788
00:56:06,510 --> 00:56:08,846
<i>And the PR people are lying</i>

789
00:56:11,390 --> 00:56:14,143
<i>And the lawyers are denying</i>

790
00:56:16,312 --> 00:56:18,731
<i>Who cares if
a few trees are dying?</i>

791
00:56:21,275 --> 00:56:23,444
<i>This is all so gratifying!</i>

792
00:56:23,611 --> 00:56:25,905
<i>How bad?</i>

793
00:56:26,072 --> 00:56:31,327
<i>How bad can this possibly be?</i>

794
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:13,911
So, how are things?

795
00:57:14,662 --> 00:57:16,539
What are you doing here?

796
00:57:16,831 --> 00:57:20,543
Happy yet? You fill that
hole deep down inside you?

797
00:57:20,668 --> 00:57:22,670
Or do you still need more?

798
00:57:22,753 --> 00:57:25,464
Look, if you've got a problem
with what I'm doing,

799
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:31,428
why haven't you used your
quote-unquote powers to stop me?

800
00:57:32,304 --> 00:57:34,974
I told you,
that's not how it works.

801
00:57:35,182 --> 00:57:38,102
Right, I forgot.
You're a fraud.

802
00:57:38,352 --> 00:57:41,021
I need you
to get out. Now!

803
00:57:41,939 --> 00:57:44,066
Why? Do I make
you uncomfortable?

804
00:57:44,150 --> 00:57:46,026
Remind you of
the promises you made?

805
00:57:46,444 --> 00:57:48,070
The man you used to be?

806
00:57:48,154 --> 00:57:49,196
You know what?

807
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:52,972
You can just shut your mustache.
My conscience is clear.

808
00:57:52,992 --> 00:57:54,577
I have done nothing illegal.

809
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:57,246
I have my rights, and I
intend to keep on biggering

810
00:57:57,371 --> 00:58:01,099
and biggering, and turning more
Truff ula trees into Thneeds.

811
00:58:01,834 --> 00:58:04,795
And nothing is
going to stop me!

812
00:58:21,187 --> 00:58:23,022
Well, that's it.

813
00:58:23,189 --> 00:58:25,232
The very last one.

814
00:58:26,275 --> 00:58:28,777
That may stop you.

815
00:58:48,964 --> 00:58:51,634
Somebody sure made
a bundle on that thing.

816
00:58:51,717 --> 00:58:55,137
I wonder what the next million
dollar invention's going to be.

817
00:59:01,018 --> 00:59:04,063
Yeah, I wonder...

818
00:59:14,782 --> 00:59:18,452
Son, you have let me down.

819
00:59:18,619 --> 00:59:21,497
Brett, you are now
my favorite child.

820
00:59:40,641 --> 00:59:42,726
Hey, look,
I don't want any trouble.

821
00:59:42,977 --> 00:59:46,897
And you won't get any.
Not from them.

822
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:50,818
Thanks to you and your hacking,
and smogging and glupping,

823
00:59:50,901 --> 00:59:52,903
they can't live here any more.

824
01:00:01,203 --> 01:00:02,746
So, I'm sending them off.

825
01:00:02,913 --> 01:00:04,373
Hopefully,
they'll be able to find

826
01:00:04,456 --> 01:00:06,375
a better place
out there somewhere.

827
01:00:10,295 --> 01:00:11,380
Melvin?

828
01:00:13,173 --> 01:00:14,883
Melvin...

829
01:00:15,926 --> 01:00:17,261
Hey, Pipsqueak...

830
01:00:21,473 --> 01:00:22,683
Hey...

831
01:01:34,713 --> 01:01:37,299
So, this is
really all your fault.

832
01:01:37,382 --> 01:01:39,301
You destroyed everything.

833
01:01:40,052 --> 01:01:41,386
Yes.

834
01:01:41,595 --> 01:01:43,847
And each day
since the Lorax left,

835
01:01:43,931 --> 01:01:47,100
I've sat here regretting
everything I've done,

836
01:01:47,267 --> 01:01:51,605
staring at that word, "unless,"

837
01:01:52,397 --> 01:01:55,359
and wondering what it meant.

838
01:01:55,526 --> 01:01:57,277
But now I'm thinking...

839
01:01:57,694 --> 01:01:58,779
Well, maybe you're the reason

840
01:01:58,862 --> 01:02:01,156
the Lorax left that word there.

841
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:04,493
Me? Why would he
leave that for me?

842
01:02:04,701 --> 01:02:08,163
Because unless someone like
you cares a whole awful lot,

843
01:02:08,455 --> 01:02:10,457
nothing is going to get better.

844
01:02:11,166 --> 01:02:12,918
It's not.

845
01:02:31,186 --> 01:02:33,397
The last Truff ula seed.

846
01:02:34,731 --> 01:02:36,900
You need to plant it, Ted.

847
01:02:37,192 --> 01:02:40,404
Yeah, but, nobody cares
about trees any more.

848
01:02:40,612 --> 01:02:41,905
Then make them care.

849
01:02:42,197 --> 01:02:45,450
Plant the seed in the middle of
town, where everyone can see.

850
01:02:45,867 --> 01:02:48,078
Change the way things are.

851
01:02:48,328 --> 01:02:50,789
I know it may seem
small and insignificant,

852
01:02:50,872 --> 01:02:53,166
but it's not about what it is,

853
01:02:53,458 --> 01:02:55,502
it's about what it can become.

854
01:02:55,711 --> 01:02:57,045
That's not just a seed,

855
01:02:57,713 --> 01:03:00,215
any more than
you're just a boy.

856
01:03:08,473 --> 01:03:10,325
I won't let you down.

857
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:13,061
I know.

858
01:03:55,771 --> 01:03:56,813
Hey, Audrey!

859
01:03:57,272 --> 01:03:58,440
Audrey!

860
01:03:59,441 --> 01:04:00,484
Ted?

861
01:04:00,567 --> 01:04:02,736
What are you doing?
Meet me at my house.

862
01:04:02,819 --> 01:04:04,071
Wait, but...

863
01:04:04,154 --> 01:04:05,739
My house, okay?

864
01:04:07,616 --> 01:04:09,284
Got to plant the seed.

865
01:04:09,367 --> 01:04:11,912
Okay, we're going
to need water.

866
01:04:12,454 --> 01:04:14,039
And uh, something to dig with.

867
01:04:14,331 --> 01:04:16,082
Um, what do I have...
Ted?

868
01:04:16,374 --> 01:04:18,376
Mom, I'm busy, Mom.

869
01:04:18,710 --> 01:04:20,295
Theodore Wiggins,
get down here right now,

870
01:04:20,378 --> 01:04:22,380
and I am not kidding with you!

871
01:04:28,970 --> 01:04:31,097
Ted, I would like
you to meet Mr. O'Hare,

872
01:04:31,181 --> 01:04:33,642
the most powerful man in town.

873
01:04:35,060 --> 01:04:36,561
There he is!

874
01:04:36,812 --> 01:04:38,063
Hello, Ted.

875
01:04:38,188 --> 01:04:39,981
Uh...

876
01:04:40,065 --> 01:04:42,818
- Hi.
- Isn't he clever, Mr. O'Hare?

877
01:04:43,401 --> 01:04:45,654
He knows his own
name and everything.

878
01:04:47,322 --> 01:04:50,575
You know what I would love
right now, Mrs. Wiggins?

879
01:04:50,659 --> 01:04:52,661
A delicious cookie.

880
01:04:54,496 --> 01:04:55,539
Wonderful.

881
01:04:55,622 --> 01:04:57,624
Teddy and I'll
stay here and talk.

882
01:04:57,707 --> 01:05:00,418
Sure, why don't you go
ahead and adopt him?

883
01:05:01,086 --> 01:05:04,548
I'm just kidding. That was a joke.
I was just joking.

884
01:05:05,632 --> 01:05:07,092
I'll get your cookie.

885
01:05:08,843 --> 01:05:10,512
I know you have it, Ted.

886
01:05:10,595 --> 01:05:13,406
So, let's put an end
to this nonsense, shall we?

887
01:05:14,391 --> 01:05:15,559
Hand it over.

888
01:05:15,684 --> 01:05:16,893
I'm sorry...

889
01:05:17,310 --> 01:05:19,187
I don't know what
you're talking about.

890
01:05:19,396 --> 01:05:21,064
Really? Well, then...

891
01:05:21,231 --> 01:05:23,692
I guess you wouldn't mind
us checking your room.

892
01:05:23,817 --> 01:05:24,901
No, no, no!

893
01:05:24,985 --> 01:05:26,736
Morty! McGurk!
Find the seed!

894
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:28,113
No, you can't go up there!

895
01:05:28,196 --> 01:05:30,381
Guys, this is
ridiculous. Stop!

896
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:32,784
Hey!

897
01:05:33,201 --> 01:05:34,786
No, you can't come in my room!

898
01:05:36,162 --> 01:05:37,247
Find it!

899
01:05:43,253 --> 01:05:44,504
Find it!

900
01:05:45,338 --> 01:05:46,833
What is going on here?

901
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:50,468
This doesn't involve you!
Get back downstairs!

902
01:05:50,552 --> 01:05:51,886
Excuse me, down there!

903
01:05:51,970 --> 01:05:54,524
I don't care who you are,
you little crazy baby-man!

904
01:05:54,531 --> 01:05:57,600
Get out of my house now.
This is outrageous.

905
01:05:57,851 --> 01:06:00,145
Fine. Sorry.

906
01:06:00,478 --> 01:06:03,440
Must have been a misunderstanding.
We'll be leaving now.

907
01:06:03,606 --> 01:06:06,318
And my apologies, Ted.

908
01:06:08,987 --> 01:06:10,322
You be safe.

909
01:06:12,991 --> 01:06:14,451
Mind telling me
what's going on here?

910
01:06:14,534 --> 01:06:16,286
The seed! Where is it?

911
01:06:16,369 --> 01:06:17,495
Seed?

912
01:06:18,872 --> 01:06:19,956
Where's Grammy?

913
01:06:23,001 --> 01:06:24,044
It's alive!

914
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:29,799
I remember you.

915
01:06:30,675 --> 01:06:32,510
Ted, what...

916
01:06:40,518 --> 01:06:41,644
Audrey!

917
01:06:44,022 --> 01:06:46,191
Hey, did you want to...
Well, okay!

918
01:06:47,192 --> 01:06:49,194
Ted, what is this about?

919
01:06:49,527 --> 01:06:51,404
It's about this.

920
01:06:52,030 --> 01:06:53,239
Wait, wait, wait.

921
01:06:53,406 --> 01:06:56,117
Is that... Yes. The
last Truff ula seed.

922
01:06:56,284 --> 01:06:58,286
And you're going to help me plant
it right in the middle of town

923
01:06:58,369 --> 01:07:00,163
where everyone can see it.

924
01:07:00,497 --> 01:07:02,207
I could just
kiss you right now!

925
01:07:06,211 --> 01:07:07,295
We don't have time for that.

926
01:07:07,587 --> 01:07:09,464
I don't know,
we have a little time.

927
01:07:11,007 --> 01:07:13,635
But, you know what, let's just go.
Let's go Forget about it.

928
01:07:41,579 --> 01:07:43,122
Maniac!
Hey!

929
01:07:45,458 --> 01:07:46,543
Ah!

930
01:07:48,711 --> 01:07:49,754
Here it comes!

931
01:07:53,550 --> 01:07:54,759
I'm going for it.

932
01:08:12,777 --> 01:08:14,237
Oh, hello!

933
01:08:27,292 --> 01:08:29,502
Ted, big scary blimp coming.

934
01:08:41,180 --> 01:08:42,265
Whoa!

935
01:08:42,807 --> 01:08:44,976
<i>You won't get away
with this, boy!</i>

936
01:08:45,476 --> 01:08:46,561
Bam!

937
01:08:57,030 --> 01:08:58,823
<i>Go faster, you idiot!</i>

938
01:08:59,866 --> 01:09:00,950
Yeah!

939
01:09:01,326 --> 01:09:03,161
Step on it, Ted!

940
01:09:03,786 --> 01:09:04,954
Whoa!

941
01:09:14,172 --> 01:09:16,007
You're fired!

942
01:09:16,632 --> 01:09:19,260
Whoa! Ted, look out!

943
01:09:22,889 --> 01:09:25,892
Nobody beats Aloysius O...
Ted...

944
01:09:37,362 --> 01:09:38,821
This is not good.

945
01:09:38,988 --> 01:09:40,865
How's it doing?

946
01:09:47,872 --> 01:09:48,956
Whoa-ho-ho!

947
01:09:51,626 --> 01:09:52,668
Loser!

948
01:09:52,752 --> 01:09:54,754
Oh, really?

949
01:09:56,381 --> 01:09:57,924
Oh, no. The seed!

950
01:10:01,052 --> 01:10:02,428
Get that seed!

951
01:10:09,060 --> 01:10:10,853
Hang on! Here we go!

952
01:10:13,940 --> 01:10:15,024
Grammy!

953
01:10:23,241 --> 01:10:25,827
Seriously, how cool
is your grandma?

954
01:10:33,251 --> 01:10:34,335
No!

955
01:10:37,922 --> 01:10:39,006
Come on!

956
01:10:39,757 --> 01:10:40,883
Yeah, that's right.

957
01:10:41,384 --> 01:10:42,468
There it is!

958
01:10:51,769 --> 01:10:55,022
Hey! Watch the road,
you meathead!

959
01:10:55,147 --> 01:10:56,274
Ah!

960
01:11:02,321 --> 01:11:03,364
Hey, ow, ow!

961
01:11:04,156 --> 01:11:05,366
Oh, come on!

962
01:11:15,334 --> 01:11:16,460
What the...

963
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:20,298
Get it unstuck, get it unstuck!

964
01:11:22,466 --> 01:11:24,135
Bring it on, Teddy!

965
01:11:25,261 --> 01:11:26,929
You don't have the guts!

966
01:11:27,638 --> 01:11:28,723
Ted!

967
01:11:36,272 --> 01:11:37,690
Grammy!

968
01:11:43,195 --> 01:11:44,238
Whoo-hoo!
Yes!

969
01:11:47,033 --> 01:11:48,117
Hey, hey, hey!

970
01:11:48,284 --> 01:11:49,785
Hey! It's Mr. O...

971
01:11:52,163 --> 01:11:53,706
Take that, shorty!

972
01:12:11,307 --> 01:12:13,517
Okay, we have to get
this in the ground.

973
01:12:13,768 --> 01:12:16,312
But where?
There's no dirt anywhere.

974
01:12:19,690 --> 01:12:21,484
No, Grammy...

975
01:12:27,239 --> 01:12:28,282
Hey, get out of there!

976
01:12:30,076 --> 01:12:31,160
Ah!

977
01:12:33,913 --> 01:12:34,997
Hey!

978
01:12:36,332 --> 01:12:38,209
What?

979
01:12:39,418 --> 01:12:42,129
See, what did
I tell you? Easy. Huh?

980
01:12:42,588 --> 01:12:45,167
Hey, they broke O'Hare's head!

981
01:12:45,174 --> 01:12:47,581
What do you think
you're doing, kid?

982
01:12:48,594 --> 01:12:51,230
Um, I'm looking for
a place to plant a tree.

983
01:12:51,237 --> 01:12:52,181
A real one.

984
01:12:52,264 --> 01:12:53,762
Why would we need a tree?

985
01:12:53,766 --> 01:12:55,810
Exactly.

986
01:12:58,687 --> 01:13:00,106
Oh, man.

987
01:13:00,689 --> 01:13:01,774
Folks...

988
01:13:02,441 --> 01:13:06,112
The last thing you
want around here is trees.

989
01:13:06,278 --> 01:13:07,863
They're filthy!

990
01:13:08,114 --> 01:13:14,036
Spewing that sticky, nasty
sap all over the place.

991
01:13:15,121 --> 01:13:19,083
They bring poisonous ants
and stinging bees.

992
01:13:19,250 --> 01:13:20,793
Hey!
Ouch.

993
01:13:20,876 --> 01:13:22,378
Think about the kids.

994
01:13:23,087 --> 01:13:27,209
And, I just thought,
you know, they make leaves!

995
01:13:27,216 --> 01:13:28,384
You know that, right?

996
01:13:28,467 --> 01:13:30,386
Then these leaves,
they just fall.

997
01:13:30,469 --> 01:13:33,304
They just fall
wherever they want!

998
01:13:33,556 --> 01:13:35,966
Come on! We know why you're
really against trees.

999
01:13:35,975 --> 01:13:38,144
Because they produce fresh air.

1000
01:13:38,227 --> 01:13:39,478
For free!

1001
01:13:39,562 --> 01:13:41,188
Oh!

1002
01:13:41,272 --> 01:13:45,025
I am wounded!
You have lied!

1003
01:13:45,151 --> 01:13:48,779
It is not a lie!
It's called photosynthesis.

1004
01:13:48,946 --> 01:13:51,073
Come on.
She's making that up!

1005
01:13:51,157 --> 01:13:53,993
That's a
made-up word, people!

1006
01:13:54,243 --> 01:13:57,955
Thneedville is perfect
just the way it is.

1007
01:13:58,122 --> 01:14:00,664
We don't need trees!

1008
01:14:00,676 --> 01:14:02,958
That boy has a seed.

1009
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:05,671
We need to stop him!
Who's with me? Come on!

1010
01:14:05,796 --> 01:14:07,089
O'Hare is right!

1011
01:14:07,339 --> 01:14:09,466
Seeds will ruin us all!
Stop it!

1012
01:14:10,593 --> 01:14:13,220
Last chance, kid.
Hand it over!

1013
01:14:13,721 --> 01:14:15,014
Where do you think
you're going?

1014
01:14:15,181 --> 01:14:16,640
Come on, let's go!

1015
01:14:16,807 --> 01:14:18,851
Get in, get in!

1016
01:14:20,686 --> 01:14:21,979
Hey!

1017
01:14:22,104 --> 01:14:23,939
Stop that maniac!

1018
01:14:25,774 --> 01:14:28,569
Excuse me, excuse me.
Watch out!

1019
01:14:32,823 --> 01:14:35,492
Ted, you're going
to hit the wall!

1020
01:14:35,659 --> 01:14:37,536
Yeah. I know.

1021
01:15:01,393 --> 01:15:03,729
Wow. Did you see that?

1022
01:15:04,438 --> 01:15:06,815
Who does this kid
think he is, huh?

1023
01:15:08,359 --> 01:15:10,194
I am Ted Wiggins.

1024
01:15:10,903 --> 01:15:13,155
And I speak for the trees.

1025
01:15:13,822 --> 01:15:18,494
And the fact is, things aren't
perfect here in Thneedville.

1026
01:15:18,744 --> 01:15:20,162
And they're only going to get worse,

1027
01:15:20,245 --> 01:15:25,334
unless we do something about it,
unless we change our ways.

1029
01:15:25,542 --> 01:15:28,796
And we can start
by planting this!

1030
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:41,424
Okay. Come on, now.
Everything is fine.

1031
01:15:41,558 --> 01:15:42,685
Right?

1032
01:15:42,768 --> 01:15:47,063
I say we tell this kid
what we think about that seed!

1033
01:15:49,525 --> 01:15:51,193
People, come on!

1034
01:15:54,947 --> 01:15:57,074
You! Get out there right now

1035
01:15:57,157 --> 01:16:01,078
and get these people on my
side, or else you're fired!

1036
01:16:02,204 --> 01:16:04,957
Go on, tell them
what you think.

1037
01:16:09,086 --> 01:16:12,631
<i>You don't know me,
but my name's Cy</i>

1038
01:16:13,382 --> 01:16:17,594
<i>I'm just
the O'Hare delivery guy</i>

1039
01:16:17,761 --> 01:16:22,214
<i>But it seems like
trees might be worth a try</i>

1040
01:16:22,224 --> 01:16:25,724
<i>So I say let it grow</i>

1041
01:16:28,730 --> 01:16:30,065
<i>My name is Dan</i>

1042
01:16:30,149 --> 01:16:31,358
<i>And my name's Rose</i>

1043
01:16:31,442 --> 01:16:34,153
<i>Our son Wesley kind of glows</i>

1044
01:16:34,403 --> 01:16:37,197
<i>And that's not good,
so we suppose</i>

1045
01:16:37,281 --> 01:16:39,032
<i>We should let it grow</i>

1046
01:16:39,116 --> 01:16:41,577
<i>Let it grow, let it grow</i>

1047
01:16:41,660 --> 01:16:44,580
<i>You can't reap
what you don't sow</i>

1048
01:16:44,830 --> 01:16:46,999
<i>Plant a seed inside the Earth</i>

1049
01:16:47,291 --> 01:16:49,543
<i>Just one way to know its worth</i>

1050
01:16:49,626 --> 01:16:52,411
<i>Let's celebrate
the world's rebirth</i>

1051
01:16:52,421 --> 01:16:54,169
<i>We say let it grow</i>

1052
01:16:54,173 --> 01:16:56,922
<i>My name's Marie,
and I am three!</i>

1053
01:16:56,925 --> 01:17:00,845
<i>I would really
like to see a tree</i>

1054
01:17:02,514 --> 01:17:04,057
<i>I say let it grow</i>

1055
01:17:04,141 --> 01:17:07,919
<i>I'm Grammy Norma I'm old,
and I've got gray hair</i>

1056
01:17:07,936 --> 01:17:11,186
<i>But I remember when
trees were everywhere</i>

1057
01:17:11,190 --> 01:17:13,855
<i>And no one had to pay for air</i>

1058
01:17:13,859 --> 01:17:15,691
<i>So I say let it grow</i>

1059
01:17:15,694 --> 01:17:18,300
<i>Let it grow, let it grow</i>

1060
01:17:18,322 --> 01:17:21,446
<i>Like it did so long ago</i>

1061
01:17:21,450 --> 01:17:23,822
<i>It is just one tiny seed</i>

1062
01:17:23,827 --> 01:17:26,285
<i>But it's all we really need</i>

1063
01:17:26,288 --> 01:17:28,997
<i>It's time to change
the life we lead</i>

1064
01:17:29,041 --> 01:17:30,872
<i>Time to let it grow</i>

1065
01:17:30,876 --> 01:17:34,463
<i>My name's O'Hare,
I'm one of you</i>

1066
01:17:34,463 --> 01:17:39,378
<i>I live here in Thneedville, too</i>

1067
01:17:39,384 --> 01:17:42,996
<i>The things you say
just might be true</i>

1068
01:17:43,013 --> 01:17:46,308
<i>It could be time to start anew</i>

1069
01:17:46,475 --> 01:17:51,880
<i>And maybe change
my point of view</i>

1070
01:17:52,147 --> 01:17:55,025
Nah! I say let it die!

1071
01:17:55,192 --> 01:17:57,444
<i>Let it die, let it die</i>

1072
01:17:57,444 --> 01:17:59,192
<i>Let it shrivel up and...</i>

1073
01:17:59,196 --> 01:18:01,448
Come on, who's with me?

1074
01:18:01,573 --> 01:18:02,741
Nobody.

1075
01:18:03,617 --> 01:18:05,238
<i>You greedy dirt-bag!</i>

1076
01:18:05,243 --> 01:18:07,826
<i>Let it grow, let it grow</i>

1077
01:18:07,829 --> 01:18:10,912
<i>Let the love inside you show</i>

1078
01:18:10,916 --> 01:18:13,498
<i>Plant a seed inside the Earth</i>

1079
01:18:13,502 --> 01:18:15,584
<i>Just one way to know its worth</i>

1080
01:18:15,587 --> 01:18:18,416
<i>Let's celebrate
the world's rebirth</i>

1081
01:18:18,423 --> 01:18:22,838
<i>We say let it grow</i>

1082
01:18:22,844 --> 01:18:25,385
<i>Let it grow, let it grow</i>

1083
01:18:25,389 --> 01:18:28,930
<i>You can't reap
what you don't sow</i>

1084
01:18:28,934 --> 01:18:31,264
<i>It's just one tiny seed</i>

1085
01:18:31,269 --> 01:18:33,725
<i>But it's all we really need</i>

1086
01:18:33,730 --> 01:18:35,937
<i>It's time to
banish all your greed</i>

1087
01:18:35,941 --> 01:18:38,897
<i>Imagine Thneedville
flowered and treed</i>

1088
01:18:38,902 --> 01:18:44,407
<i>Let this be our solemn creed</i>

1089
01:18:44,533 --> 01:18:46,660
Thank you, Ted.

1090
01:18:47,786 --> 01:18:51,408
<i>We say let it grow</i>

1091
01:18:51,415 --> 01:18:53,914
<i>In Thneedville</i>

1092
01:18:53,917 --> 01:18:57,626
<i>We say let it grow</i>

1093
01:18:57,629 --> 01:19:00,128
<i>It's a brand new dawn</i>

1094
01:19:00,132 --> 01:19:03,715
<i>We say let it grow</i>

1095
01:19:03,719 --> 01:19:05,720
<i>In Thneedville</i>

1096
01:19:05,721 --> 01:19:09,387
<i>We say let it grow</i>

1097
01:19:09,391 --> 01:19:14,416
<i>It's a brand new dawn</i>

1098
01:20:17,417 --> 01:20:19,929
You done good, Beanpole.

1099
01:20:20,337 --> 01:20:22,047
You done good.

1100
01:20:35,685 --> 01:20:38,355
By the way, nice mustache.
