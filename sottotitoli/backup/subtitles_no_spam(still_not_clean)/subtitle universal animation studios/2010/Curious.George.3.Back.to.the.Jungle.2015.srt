1
00:01:04,673 --> 00:01:07,209
I don't know, George.

2
00:01:07,309 --> 00:01:10,321
Is it too windy for flying a kite?

3
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:13,674
Thinking that's a yes.

4
00:01:14,427 --> 00:01:15,978
George?

5
00:01:18,986 --> 00:01:20,521
George!

6
00:01:26,227 --> 00:01:27,129
Hi.

7
00:01:30,198 --> 00:01:34,101
You're right, George. It's awesome.

8
00:01:38,373 --> 00:01:40,241
You want to fly it yourself?

9
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:48,149
And regretting this in three, two, one.

10
00:01:50,518 --> 00:01:52,254
George!

11
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:54,723
Hey.

12
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:57,559
Hi.

13
00:02:00,462 --> 00:02:03,632
<i>You feel safe with your feet
on the ground</i>

14
00:02:03,732 --> 00:02:08,303
- <i>Where everything's predictable</i>
- George, come down from there!

15
00:02:08,403 --> 00:02:13,675
<i>So many possibilities passing you by</i>

16
00:02:16,411 --> 00:02:19,047
<i>Well, drop your things
And look up to the sky</i>

17
00:02:19,147 --> 00:02:22,817
Sorry about that.
My monkey got carried away.

18
00:02:23,418 --> 00:02:26,296
- <i>'Cause when you're up for anything</i>
- George!

19
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,922
- That's not safe!
- <i>You reach higher</i>

20
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:31,660
<i>You take your worries and say goodbye</i>

21
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,442
<i>When you're up for anything</i>

22
00:02:34,542 --> 00:02:37,832
- <i>You live open and free</i>
- Sorry about that.

23
00:02:37,932 --> 00:02:40,569
<i>So come on, come on with me</i>

24
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:51,580
- <i>I guess you never heard it before</i>
- Hi.

25
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,318
- George!
- <i>But nothing is impossible</i>

26
00:02:56,418 --> 00:03:01,859
<i>Sometimes you got to give it another try</i>

27
00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:09,497
<i>But dig deep and put your fears aside</i>

28
00:03:11,433 --> 00:03:15,083
<i>'Cause when you're up for anything
you reach higher</i>

29
00:03:15,183 --> 00:03:19,576
- Begging your pardon. Have a nice day!
- <i>You take your worries and say goodbye</i>

30
00:03:19,676 --> 00:03:22,444
<i>When you're up for anything</i>

31
00:03:22,544 --> 00:03:25,881
<i>You live open and free</i>

32
00:03:25,981 --> 00:03:31,018
<i>So come on, come on with me, yeah</i>

33
00:03:32,654 --> 00:03:36,141
<i>You can wait for life to bring you</i>

34
00:03:36,241 --> 00:03:38,386
- <i>All your hopes and dreams</i>
- Bye.

35
00:03:38,486 --> 00:03:40,578
- <i>Wrapped in a bow</i>
- Yikes!

36
00:03:41,228 --> 00:03:45,545
<i>I won't tell you what to do</i>

37
00:03:45,988 --> 00:03:47,769
<i>No</i>

38
00:03:48,938 --> 00:03:51,873
- <i>But happiness is out there</i>
- My bad.

39
00:03:51,973 --> 00:03:56,644
<i>And how much you can grab is up to you</i>

40
00:03:58,715 --> 00:04:01,215
<i>It's up to you</i>

41
00:04:01,315 --> 00:04:03,518
George, the park is no place
to fly a kite.

42
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:07,922
<i>'Cause when you're up for anything
you reach higher</i>

43
00:04:08,022 --> 00:04:11,693
<i>You take your worries and say goodbye</i>

44
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:14,429
<i>When you're up for anything</i>

45
00:04:14,529 --> 00:04:17,865
<i>You live open and free</i>

46
00:04:17,965 --> 00:04:19,734
<i>So come on, come on</i>

47
00:04:19,834 --> 00:04:23,838
<i>When you're up for anything
you reach higher</i>

48
00:04:23,938 --> 00:04:27,594
<i>You take your worries and say goodbye</i>

49
00:04:27,694 --> 00:04:32,580
<i>When you're up for anything
you live open and free...</i>

50
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,522
Okay, now you gotta go
a little to the left.

51
00:04:35,617 --> 00:04:37,152
Now to the right. No!

52
00:04:44,426 --> 00:04:49,096
George, that was very, very, very...

53
00:04:51,098 --> 00:04:52,934
not good.

54
00:04:54,135 --> 00:04:56,805
When will you learn caution, George?

55
00:04:56,905 --> 00:04:59,774
Forget about "no"
and "yes" and "banana."

56
00:04:59,874 --> 00:05:02,510
You need to learn the word "caution."

57
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:05,680
How about the word "lawsuit?"

58
00:05:07,882 --> 00:05:11,019
I'm so sorry.
Here's my contact information.

59
00:05:11,119 --> 00:05:14,755
My insurance company
and dry cleaner are on the back. I...

60
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:21,246
There you go. Yes, one for you, too.
It'll come out. I promise.

61
00:05:21,496 --> 00:05:23,498
Come along, George.

62
00:05:24,265 --> 00:05:26,301
Bye!

63
00:05:38,946 --> 00:05:44,018
Okay, George. I need you
to wait here while I get cleaned up.

64
00:05:45,119 --> 00:05:46,588
And please...

65
00:05:47,922 --> 00:05:50,157
no more surprises.

66
00:05:54,195 --> 00:05:57,165
The time for adventure is over.

67
00:06:19,954 --> 00:06:21,789
George?

68
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:24,492
I'll be right there.

69
00:06:34,135 --> 00:06:35,670
Hi.

70
00:06:39,257 --> 00:06:41,059
George?

71
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:43,144
Come down from there.

72
00:06:43,244 --> 00:06:45,547
But he's havin' so much fun.

73
00:06:45,647 --> 00:06:48,149
Yes, but he shouldn't be...

74
00:06:48,655 --> 00:06:49,951
Who are you?

75
00:06:50,151 --> 00:06:53,154
I've come to see a man about a monkey.

76
00:06:53,254 --> 00:06:55,623
Let me guess. Yellow hat,

77
00:06:55,723 --> 00:06:58,721
yellow suit, look of deep distress.

78
00:06:58,821 --> 00:07:02,714
You must be Ted,
which means that must be...

79
00:07:02,814 --> 00:07:03,982
Hello.

80
00:07:04,332 --> 00:07:07,068
Hello, George.
It's an honor to meet you.

81
00:07:09,203 --> 00:07:12,740
Hal Houston from GSA,
the Global Space Agency.

82
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,810
And this is my tactical assistant,
Andrew.

83
00:07:16,277 --> 00:07:19,047
- <i>Hello.</i>
- Hi.

84
00:07:19,347 --> 00:07:22,184
We've had our eye on George
for some time.

85
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:29,323
- Look, if we owe you for any damage...
- Oh, no, no. Nothing like that.

86
00:07:29,423 --> 00:07:33,695
We want George
for a very important mission.

87
00:07:39,601 --> 00:07:42,003
A space mission.

88
00:07:43,805 --> 00:07:46,540
Yes, you! Hop aboard.

89
00:07:53,281 --> 00:07:56,751
Did you know the first astronauts
were monkeys?

90
00:07:57,251 --> 00:08:00,688
They went boldly
where no man has gone before.

91
00:08:01,623 --> 00:08:03,658
They were heroes.

92
00:08:04,058 --> 00:08:06,895
How would you like to be one of them?

93
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:11,999
So, what is this mission?

94
00:08:12,099 --> 00:08:15,269
I'm glad you asked. Andrew?

95
00:08:23,177 --> 00:08:28,182
Welcome to majestic Central Africa.

96
00:08:31,285 --> 00:08:32,554
Oops.

97
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:39,593
As I was saying,
majestic Central Africa!

98
00:08:40,762 --> 00:08:43,497
This is where you came from, George.

99
00:08:48,436 --> 00:08:52,240
Lately it's been getting a lot of rain,
causing rivers to overflow.

100
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:55,277
And do you know what that means? Andrew.

101
00:08:58,946 --> 00:09:00,849
That's right, flooding.

102
00:09:07,925 --> 00:09:12,126
To help control the flooding, we created
a device about as big as your hand,

103
00:09:12,226 --> 00:09:17,131
which we call the Regional
Dam Synchronizer. RDS.

104
00:09:17,231 --> 00:09:19,408
<i>We put it in our satellite,</i>

105
00:09:19,508 --> 00:09:21,711
<i>and with the satellite...</i>

106
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:25,673
<i>we can control
the distribution of water.</i>

107
00:09:27,675 --> 00:09:30,612
<i>We call it Project Stop Flooding.</i>

108
00:09:33,314 --> 00:09:36,851
The problem is...
and this is the embarrassing part.

109
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:41,789
<i>Our satellite containing the RDS
has failed and can't be fixed.</i>

110
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,926
And without it... Andrew.

111
00:09:45,192 --> 00:09:46,928
Oh, boy.

112
00:09:48,396 --> 00:09:49,931
More flooding.

113
00:09:55,436 --> 00:10:00,575
Yes, George. The flooding is very bad
for the animals and the land.

114
00:10:00,675 --> 00:10:04,278
That's why we need a brave monkey
to go up in space

115
00:10:04,378 --> 00:10:08,682
and get that RDS,
so we can install it...

116
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:13,287
Here in our new Ground
Communications Tower in Africa.

117
00:10:13,387 --> 00:10:15,424
Right on the Louis Leakey Dam.

118
00:10:16,224 --> 00:10:20,662
We're not taking a chance on putting it
directly in a space satellite again.

119
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:25,266
Why can't you just put another RDS
in that tower and not go to space?

120
00:10:25,366 --> 00:10:29,471
It's custom-built! It would take
forever to create a new one.

121
00:10:29,871 --> 00:10:32,841
So what do you say, George?
Can we count on ya?

122
00:10:35,543 --> 00:10:37,708
No! No! I mean...

123
00:10:37,808 --> 00:10:42,817
No kidding, that's a valuable mission,
but why not send a human?

124
00:10:42,917 --> 00:10:46,120
The human-size rockets
have all been moved to museums.

125
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:51,025
But I tracked down a monkey capsule
in mint condition.

126
00:10:56,147 --> 00:10:58,883
Thanks for the offer, Mr. Houston,

127
00:10:58,983 --> 00:11:01,119
but I don't think it's a good idea.

128
00:11:06,941 --> 00:11:08,643
I'm sorry, George.

129
00:11:09,143 --> 00:11:12,013
Not everyone loves adventure like we do.

130
00:11:13,114 --> 00:11:14,382
Let's go, Andrew.

131
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:31,132
Hey. Wait.

132
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:34,135
I didn't say no, exactly.

133
00:11:36,137 --> 00:11:38,112
Are you sure this is safe?

134
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:43,944
Why, it's as safe as flying a kite!

135
00:11:49,817 --> 00:11:51,485
Okay, George.

136
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:55,923
But only if you complete
the training without a hitch.

137
00:11:59,226 --> 00:12:01,963
Let's get you in training!

138
00:12:08,836 --> 00:12:10,796
<i>Let's go</i>

139
00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:14,293
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

140
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,914
<i>Well, let's say
you're caught up in a bind</i>

141
00:12:20,014 --> 00:12:23,340
<i>Well, I've got the perfect guy in mind</i>

142
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,954
<i>He sees things a different way</i>

143
00:12:26,222 --> 00:12:30,458
<i>A stumble here and there,
but things are okay</i>

144
00:12:30,558 --> 00:12:33,694
<i>At first glance
you just might have your doubts</i>

145
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:37,175
<i>But this guy he always works it out</i>

146
00:12:37,275 --> 00:12:39,801
<i>Stays tough and saves the day</i>

147
00:12:39,901 --> 00:12:44,221
<i>'Cause giving up ain't in his DNA</i>

148
00:12:44,321 --> 00:12:46,574
<i>Yeah, he might be a little strange</i>

149
00:12:46,674 --> 00:12:49,911
<i>But he'll help you, yes, he can</i>

150
00:12:50,011 --> 00:12:53,915
<i>Yeah, he's only just
your ordinary superman</i>

151
00:12:54,015 --> 00:12:58,519
- <i>He can help you, yes he can</i>
- <i>Yes, he can</i>

152
00:12:58,619 --> 00:13:01,122
<i>He's your ordinary superman</i>

153
00:13:01,222 --> 00:13:04,692
<i>He's so cool you wanna be like him</i>

154
00:13:04,792 --> 00:13:08,096
<i>Nonstop and never givin' in</i>

155
00:13:08,196 --> 00:13:10,698
<i>Head first and steely-eyed</i>

156
00:13:10,798 --> 00:13:14,802
<i>When things are down
he's always lookin' upside</i>

157
00:13:14,902 --> 00:13:18,222
<i>He might take a different route than you</i>

158
00:13:18,322 --> 00:13:21,842
<i>But he's got a different point of view</i>

159
00:13:21,942 --> 00:13:24,445
<i>Leaves most folks scratchin' their heads</i>

160
00:13:24,545 --> 00:13:28,666
<i>If only they would listen to what I said</i>

161
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:31,102
<i>That he might be a little strange</i>

162
00:13:31,202 --> 00:13:33,988
<i>But he'll help you, yes, he can</i>

163
00:13:34,588 --> 00:13:38,492
<i>Yeah, he's only just
your ordinary superman</i>

164
00:13:38,592 --> 00:13:41,095
<i>He can help you, yes, he can</i>

165
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:45,333
<i>Yes, he can, he's your ordinary superman</i>

166
00:13:45,433 --> 00:13:49,204
- <i>He can help you, yes, he can</i>
- <i>Baby, yes, he can</i>

167
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:53,007
<i>He's your ordinary superman</i>

168
00:13:53,407 --> 00:13:56,977
- Yeah! Yeah!
- <i>He's just a superman...</i>

169
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,218
George!

170
00:14:05,953 --> 00:14:10,758
George, I now certify you space-ready.

171
00:14:14,995 --> 00:14:17,264
What do you say, Ted?

172
00:14:20,768 --> 00:14:22,703
I say...

173
00:14:25,439 --> 00:14:27,575
Congratulations, George.

174
00:14:28,275 --> 00:14:31,078
You've got the right stuff.

175
00:14:59,306 --> 00:15:03,277
I'm gonna miss you, George.
Be careful up there.

176
00:15:07,581 --> 00:15:09,917
I can't go with you, George,

177
00:15:10,017 --> 00:15:13,086
but I brought you something
to keep you company.

178
00:15:24,431 --> 00:15:26,700
I love you, too.

179
00:15:27,835 --> 00:15:30,815
And I'll be right here waiting for you.

180
00:15:31,605 --> 00:15:35,175
Good luck on your mission,
Space Monkey George.

181
00:16:02,035 --> 00:16:05,038
Relax, Ted. Everything's gonna be fine.

182
00:16:05,138 --> 00:16:06,640
Are you sure?

183
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,309
Yes!

184
00:16:08,409 --> 00:16:13,047
I personally reviewed and accounted for
all aspects of this mission.

185
00:16:13,147 --> 00:16:15,649
Trust me, nothing will go wrong.

186
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:19,253
Andrew, let's get the party started.

187
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:22,557
Space Monkey George,
are you ready for launch?

188
00:16:24,992 --> 00:16:26,961
<i>T minus five...</i>

189
00:16:27,061 --> 00:16:31,132
<i>four, three, two, one.</i>

190
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,802
<i>Liftoff!</i>

191
00:17:14,975 --> 00:17:18,579
<i>The capsule will auto dock
with the satellite in five...</i>

192
00:17:19,378 --> 00:17:21,749
<i>four... three...</i>

193
00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:24,585
two... one.

194
00:17:24,785 --> 00:17:27,721
<i>Capsule has successfully
docked with the satellite.</i>

195
00:17:27,821 --> 00:17:29,690
Yeah!

196
00:17:31,492 --> 00:17:33,961
Space Monkey George, proceed.

197
00:17:36,563 --> 00:17:37,932
Good luck, George.

198
00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:00,688
Okay, George.
Now just the way you practiced.

199
00:18:16,414 --> 00:18:19,240
- Yeah!
- He has the RDS in his possession!

200
00:18:23,777 --> 00:18:25,346
Hug it up, Teddy boy!

201
00:18:29,016 --> 00:18:30,951
People...

202
00:18:33,753 --> 00:18:35,456
Andrew, do something!

203
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:37,875
George, the RDS!

204
00:18:37,975 --> 00:18:40,974
<i>You've lost the RDS!</i>

205
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:48,079
Go get it, George!

206
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,659
He did it!

207
00:18:56,977 --> 00:18:58,779
That's my George.

208
00:19:15,496 --> 00:19:19,500
Nice work, Space Monkey George.
We're bringing you home.

209
00:19:22,503 --> 00:19:24,871
Activating capsule return.

210
00:19:36,783 --> 00:19:38,786
And that's lunch.

211
00:19:42,589 --> 00:19:46,093
We're celebrating. Come on, George.
You can join us.

212
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:51,631
We call it celestial slime.

213
00:19:52,533 --> 00:19:54,617
Astronauts love it.

214
00:19:56,503 --> 00:19:59,873
Or you can check the bag
I hid behind your seat.

215
00:20:05,422 --> 00:20:09,650
Peanut butter and banana, his favorite.
I hope you don't mind.

216
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:13,754
No problem. It's my favorite, too.

217
00:20:13,854 --> 00:20:17,090
<i>Take five, George. You deserve it.</i>

218
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:46,954
Should George be doing that?

219
00:20:47,054 --> 00:20:50,424
Ted, stop worrying and relax.

220
00:20:50,524 --> 00:20:54,261
The mission's accomplished.
What could happen now?

221
00:21:01,113 --> 00:21:02,903
I've lost control.

222
00:21:03,003 --> 00:21:05,832
- Houston, we have a problem!
- What?

223
00:21:09,843 --> 00:21:12,045
<i>Capsule is in freefall.</i>

224
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:14,948
Freefall? That's not good! Right?

225
00:21:15,048 --> 00:21:17,385
Technically, that's not good.

226
00:21:25,192 --> 00:21:26,527
Yahoo!

227
00:21:34,134 --> 00:21:35,769
Save my monkey!

228
00:21:35,869 --> 00:21:38,572
Eject, George! Hit the red button!

229
00:21:48,381 --> 00:21:50,984
George? The red button!

230
00:21:51,084 --> 00:21:54,254
<i>Eject! Hit the red button!</i>

231
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:02,229
<i>Emergency ejection enabled.</i>

232
00:22:02,973 --> 00:22:04,157
<i>Ejection.</i>

233
00:22:25,669 --> 00:22:28,722
- He ejected!
- That's great! Now what?

234
00:22:28,822 --> 00:22:30,124
Now we go get him.

235
00:22:35,262 --> 00:22:36,630
Where are we going?

236
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:40,234
Central Africa.

237
00:22:40,434 --> 00:22:44,421
Of course! Don't worry, Ted.
I'll find our monkey.

238
00:22:44,521 --> 00:22:47,558
I'm not worried. I'm coming with you.

239
00:22:49,109 --> 00:22:51,111
Hello?

240
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,116
Hello?

241
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:43,530
So what's the plan?

242
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:47,167
Let's take a look
at the surrounding area. Andrew.

243
00:23:48,201 --> 00:23:53,307
- Welcome to majestic Central...
- Let's not. Where's George?

244
00:23:53,907 --> 00:23:57,010
Last report had George
over the Lotta Watta Falls.

245
00:23:57,110 --> 00:24:00,414
We're pretty sure
he's within a 500-mile radius.

246
00:24:00,714 --> 00:24:03,951
- 500-mile radius?
- You mean circumference.

247
00:24:04,051 --> 00:24:07,337
I'm pretty sure it's radius.
Circumference goes around the circle.

248
00:24:07,437 --> 00:24:08,739
- Definitely circumference.
- Hold on.

249
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:11,625
Five hundred miles of anything
is really big.

250
00:24:11,725 --> 00:24:14,061
Have you ever found an astronaut before?

251
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:18,532
We've never lost one before.
But we have five teams out looking.

252
00:24:18,632 --> 00:24:20,922
Now you've got six.

253
00:24:21,022 --> 00:24:21,969
Ted?

254
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:26,440
- Where are you going?
- To find my monkey.

255
00:24:27,908 --> 00:24:29,810
Circumference?

256
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:31,745
Radius.

257
00:24:41,588 --> 00:24:42,599
Yeah.

258
00:24:45,158 --> 00:24:47,761
Excuse me. I need a pilot and a plane.

259
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:51,197
No tours today. Pilot out sick.

260
00:24:52,232 --> 00:24:54,268
There must be someone who can fly.

261
00:24:54,768 --> 00:24:59,039
Listen, friend. I told you.
We don't have any pilots available. Hey.

262
00:25:02,242 --> 00:25:04,211
Global Space Agency?

263
00:25:04,811 --> 00:25:06,813
Are you an astronaut?

264
00:25:06,913 --> 00:25:10,300
Oh, that. It's a long story.

265
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,737
You guys know more
about piloting than anyone.

266
00:25:14,121 --> 00:25:16,072
You can take the plane yourself.

267
00:25:16,172 --> 00:25:19,159
- No, you don't understand.
- And if you want to get into the air today,

268
00:25:19,259 --> 00:25:21,694
you'll need to fly it.

269
00:25:25,866 --> 00:25:29,169
Flying an airplane...
how hard can it be?

270
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:35,175
It's like a car, except you drive
in the air where you can fall and...

271
00:25:37,314 --> 00:25:39,846
What am I thinking? I can't do this!

272
00:25:44,451 --> 00:25:46,653
That wasn't so hard.

273
00:25:57,297 --> 00:25:59,344
I'm in the air.

274
00:25:59,833 --> 00:26:02,769
And I'm heading for a tree!

275
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:59,225
Trees all look alike.

276
00:26:59,325 --> 00:27:01,528
Except for that one
with the parachute on it.

277
00:27:01,628 --> 00:27:04,014
Parachute? Yes!

278
00:27:09,136 --> 00:27:13,473
"Reduce throttle.
Gently touch the water."

279
00:27:14,107 --> 00:27:15,942
Simple.

280
00:27:26,252 --> 00:27:27,938
Oh, no.

281
00:27:28,038 --> 00:27:29,600
Look out!

282
00:27:40,901 --> 00:27:43,904
Come in, Mr. Plane Rental Man.

283
00:27:44,004 --> 00:27:47,741
I have the funniest story to tell ya.

284
00:27:48,274 --> 00:27:50,610
Or not.

285
00:27:52,378 --> 00:27:54,230
Okay.

286
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:56,649
Got map.

287
00:27:57,751 --> 00:28:01,287
And subway tokens.

288
00:28:01,954 --> 00:28:03,523
All right.

289
00:28:03,623 --> 00:28:07,193
Everything's under control. Here I go.

290
00:28:11,798 --> 00:28:16,984
I've got to find George.
The jungle is no place for a monkey.

291
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:31,033
<i>Everything's so different
How'd you end up here</i>

292
00:28:31,884 --> 00:28:35,822
<i>Reach out and grab it
Let your worries disappear</i>

293
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:39,609
<i>'Cause it's a once in a lifetime
opportunity</i>

294
00:28:39,709 --> 00:28:41,978
<i>Is waitin' straight ahead</i>

295
00:28:43,163 --> 00:28:45,337
<i>That's what I said</i>

296
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:50,971
<i>And if you fall down and skin your knee
Well, you get back up again</i>

297
00:28:51,638 --> 00:28:55,476
<i>Roll with the changes
Take a few chances now and then</i>

298
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:58,278
<i>Make every moment count</i>

299
00:28:58,378 --> 00:29:02,982
<i>And you just might have
the time of your life</i>

300
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:07,620
<i>Welcome to paradise</i>

301
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:15,662
<i>Hey, you, you're missing out
on all the fun</i>

302
00:29:16,389 --> 00:29:20,200
<i>Just take it easy
seems you're always on the run</i>

303
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,287
<i>Slow it down</i>

304
00:29:21,387 --> 00:29:27,040
<i>Take in the scenery
and give into the magic of the day</i>

305
00:29:27,707 --> 00:29:29,942
<i>That's what I say</i>

306
00:29:31,277 --> 00:29:36,049
<i>Woke up to sunshine
Now it's pouring rain</i>

307
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:39,953
<i>No guarantees, enjoy it all the same</i>

308
00:29:40,053 --> 00:29:42,505
<i>I'm telling you,
it's all how you take it</i>

309
00:29:42,605 --> 00:29:47,108
<i>Grab those lemons
and you make some lemonade</i>

310
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,545
<i>You got it made</i>

311
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:55,719
<i>And if you fall down and skin your knee
Well, you get back up again</i>

312
00:29:55,819 --> 00:30:00,006

00:30:18,925 --> 00:30:22,428

00:30:25,765 --> 00:30:28,636

00:30:32,105 --> 00:30:37,277
<i>And if you fall down and skin your knee
Well, you get back up again</i>

321
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:42,482
<i>Roll with the changes
Take a few chances now and then</i>

322
00:30:42,984 --> 00:30:44,662
<i>Make every moment count</i>

323
00:30:44,762 --> 00:30:49,522
<i>And you just might have
the time of your life</i>

324
00:30:50,456 --> 00:30:54,193
<i>Welcome to paradise</i>

325
00:30:55,962 --> 00:30:58,532
<i>To paradise</i>

326
00:31:01,103 --> 00:31:05,211
<i>To paradise</i>

327
00:31:27,227 --> 00:31:31,431
Goodnight, George, wherever you are.

328
00:31:43,176 --> 00:31:46,146
Team 5. Come in, Team 5.

329
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:47,814
- Sir.
- Not now, Andrew.

330
00:31:47,914 --> 00:31:49,516
I'm trying to contact Team 5.

331
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:53,219
You're speaking into your hot dog.

332
00:31:53,853 --> 00:31:55,889
They're very good, by the way.

333
00:31:57,690 --> 00:31:59,359
Team 5, anything yet?

334
00:31:59,859 --> 00:32:02,829
<i>No sign of the monkey or the capsule.</i>

335
00:32:03,329 --> 00:32:06,266
I'm tired of waiting around, Andrew.
There's an old saying...

336
00:32:06,366 --> 00:32:09,936
"If you want something done right,
do it yourself."

337
00:32:11,537 --> 00:32:15,909
This is Search Command One.
We're heading out.

338
00:32:16,009 --> 00:32:17,910
Hot dog.

339
00:32:40,733 --> 00:32:43,302
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

340
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:11,191
I can't take this!

341
00:34:11,291 --> 00:34:15,661
I just want my monkey so I can go home!

342
00:34:19,899 --> 00:34:20,867
George?

343
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:26,572
Thank goodness I've found you!

344
00:34:26,873 --> 00:34:30,783
I was so worried about you.

345
00:34:31,311 --> 00:34:35,047
That is the last time you go into
outer space and crash-land on Earth,

346
00:34:35,147 --> 00:34:36,949
you hear me?

347
00:34:38,685 --> 00:34:41,655
I missed you so much, George.

348
00:34:43,856 --> 00:34:46,659
Now, let's go home.

349
00:35:20,626 --> 00:35:22,795
You know the problem with maps?

350
00:35:22,895 --> 00:35:25,631
They only work if you know
where you are.

351
00:35:25,731 --> 00:35:28,668
They should invent a map to help you know
where you are on the map.

352
00:35:28,768 --> 00:35:34,110
Okay, I'm thinking the river is here.
What do you think, George?

353
00:35:39,745 --> 00:35:41,047
George?

354
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:48,815
We're lost in Central Africa.
We need to work on getting home.

355
00:35:56,062 --> 00:35:57,964
Ta-da!

356
00:35:59,432 --> 00:36:01,668
Things around here
could be dangerous, George.

357
00:36:01,768 --> 00:36:03,670
You need to exercise a little caution.

358
00:36:06,672 --> 00:36:10,076
What I mean is that you need
to be more careful.

359
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:20,713
You're a curious little monkey,
and I know you like to play,

360
00:36:20,813 --> 00:36:24,857
but from now on
I want you to stick by me, okay?

361
00:36:26,659 --> 00:36:28,361
George?

362
00:36:29,128 --> 00:36:30,963
George!

363
00:36:31,664 --> 00:36:33,066
George!

364
00:36:39,872 --> 00:36:42,658
George? What did I say about caution?

365
00:36:42,758 --> 00:36:45,094
Those are wild elephants.

366
00:36:47,863 --> 00:36:49,782
I'm sure they are nice,

367
00:36:49,882 --> 00:36:52,819
but so's a city bus
until it runs over you.

368
00:36:54,887 --> 00:36:57,940
This is my serious voice now...

369
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,993
I want you to come down this minute.

370
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:04,830
I am not getting
on that big smelly thing!

371
00:37:14,707 --> 00:37:16,555
Bye.

372
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:21,514
Now I want you to promise me, George,
no more adventures.

373
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:23,549
You got it?

374
00:37:25,685 --> 00:37:30,756
You can't just go around wherever you like
in a jungle. You need to watch yourself.

375
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,930
Now I'm pretty sure if we go
this way, we'll reach the river.

376
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:40,733
And when we get to a village,
they'll call Mr. Houston for us.

377
00:37:40,833 --> 00:37:44,770
We'll be home before you can say
"banana." Right, George?

378
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:46,772
George?

379
00:37:48,574 --> 00:37:52,145
Oh, no. Remember? Caution?

380
00:37:59,952 --> 00:38:02,188
George! Where are you?

381
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:19,605
What did I just say?
No! No, no! Bad George!

382
00:38:21,641 --> 00:38:23,643
Now, let's go.

383
00:38:27,146 --> 00:38:29,932
You need to learn that I'm the grown-up
and you're the monkey.

384
00:38:30,032 --> 00:38:34,987
Monkeys do what grown-ups say.
That's how it's gonna be from now on.

385
00:38:35,455 --> 00:38:38,491
No more Mr. Nice Man
With The Yellow Hat.

386
00:38:38,591 --> 00:38:41,160
I'm putting my foot down!

387
00:38:49,502 --> 00:38:51,570
Oh, boy.

388
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:01,514
What's all that growling?

389
00:39:01,947 --> 00:39:05,752
Help! Please! Get me down.
That gorilla wants to eat me for dinner!

390
00:39:08,421 --> 00:39:12,158
Don't be a worrywart. He's a vegetarian.

391
00:39:12,258 --> 00:39:16,229
Well, except for a bug or two.
Right, Seymour?

392
00:39:16,962 --> 00:39:20,700
- You... You know him?
- I rescued him.

393
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:26,138
I run this animal preserve.
Kulinda, Naja P. Doctor.

394
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:29,427
He helps me catch poachers like you.

395
00:39:29,809 --> 00:39:34,314
Animal preserve? Poachers?
No, this is a terrible mistake.

396
00:39:34,414 --> 00:39:37,083
I'm not a poacher.
I'm a museum director.

397
00:39:37,383 --> 00:39:40,086
Right. And that's your city monkey?

398
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:44,656
It's true! Tell her, George.

399
00:39:49,161 --> 00:39:52,114
This... this is just
a big misunderstanding.

400
00:39:52,214 --> 00:39:54,650
It's really quite funny.

401
00:39:55,668 --> 00:39:58,036
Come on, little fellow.

402
00:39:59,338 --> 00:40:01,507
Let's get you home.

403
00:40:02,241 --> 00:40:04,276
You like the hat?

404
00:40:06,312 --> 00:40:09,381
Seymour, bring him.

405
00:40:14,687 --> 00:40:18,924
Tree branch ahead. I wonder
if you could watch the head.

406
00:40:19,024 --> 00:40:20,860
Okay, we'll work on that.

407
00:40:40,139 --> 00:40:44,150
Have some fruit, little monkey.
I'll be down in a minute.

408
00:41:03,349 --> 00:41:04,330
George.

409
00:41:10,643 --> 00:41:13,713
George, I shouldn't have blown my top.

410
00:41:13,813 --> 00:41:16,916
I guess even big people
can be wrong sometimes.

411
00:41:21,754 --> 00:41:23,989
You know what I was really wrong about?

412
00:41:24,089 --> 00:41:26,225
You're not bad, George.

413
00:41:26,325 --> 00:41:28,962
You're the best George
in the whole world.

414
00:41:31,997 --> 00:41:34,967
I'm so sorry.

415
00:41:35,434 --> 00:41:36,736
Forgive me?

416
00:41:43,842 --> 00:41:45,278
Buddy.

417
00:41:51,117 --> 00:41:52,919
What's gotten into you two?

418
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:59,291
Come here, little monkey.

419
00:42:02,494 --> 00:42:03,929
Look, Dr. Kulinda...

420
00:42:04,029 --> 00:42:07,533
Don't try to form a bond with me
by using my name.

421
00:42:07,633 --> 00:42:09,506
Call me...

422
00:42:09,935 --> 00:42:15,240
Dr. African Scientist Worker Lady.

423
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:17,977
Okay, Dr. Worker...

424
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:20,763
African Scientist.

425
00:42:23,282 --> 00:42:26,919
African Scientist Doctor Lady.

426
00:42:27,019 --> 00:42:30,423
This can all be cleared up.
I just need one phone call.

427
00:42:31,392 --> 00:42:35,295
Gonna lawyer up? Well, forget it, pal.
The phones are out.

428
00:43:01,687 --> 00:43:04,356
I see you've met Strich.

429
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:07,536
She likes bananas.

430
00:43:07,636 --> 00:43:11,497
Is there any way of communicating
with the outside world?

431
00:43:11,597 --> 00:43:15,117
'Fraid not. Unless you poached
some pigeons, too.

432
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:19,672
All the phones went out the day they shot up
that rocket for the Project Stop Flooding.

433
00:43:21,057 --> 00:43:25,477
Hey. You know about that?
That was George's mission.

434
00:43:26,912 --> 00:43:28,814
Wait a minute.

435
00:43:28,914 --> 00:43:32,151
You're the monkey astronaut
we've been hearing about?

436
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:40,593
That's right. And I'm with George.

437
00:43:41,193 --> 00:43:44,018
I did hear that astronaut was friends

438
00:43:44,118 --> 00:43:47,912
with some big city bozo
with a yellow hat.

439
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:51,654
That's me!

440
00:43:53,789 --> 00:43:55,441
I should have figured it out.

441
00:43:55,541 --> 00:43:58,778
How many ridiculous hats like yours
are there in the world?

442
00:43:58,878 --> 00:44:01,764
I know, exactly! What?

443
00:44:01,864 --> 00:44:06,151
Why didn't you say so earlier?
Seymour, untie him.

444
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:12,725
No! Okay, Seymour, remember that...
Watch the head thing!

445
00:44:14,994 --> 00:44:17,396
Okay. Gettin' a little better.

446
00:44:20,466 --> 00:44:22,735
Anything, Andrew?

447
00:44:23,502 --> 00:44:25,187
Not yet, sir.

448
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:28,141
The map shows Kulinda
Animal Preserve is within range.

449
00:44:29,241 --> 00:44:31,344
Maybe it's worth a flyover.

450
00:44:31,744 --> 00:44:35,881
I think it's highly unlikely that George
would have gotten that far.

451
00:44:35,981 --> 00:44:40,386
Well, it's just...
Well, you never know and...

452
00:44:40,486 --> 00:44:45,758
Well, I've heard Doctor Kulinda's
tree house is so cool and awesome.

453
00:44:45,858 --> 00:44:49,261
Well, if George made it to this area,
I'd bet he'd go there.

454
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:51,997
All right, fan-boy.
We'll give it a flyby.

455
00:44:52,864 --> 00:44:54,633
Yes!

456
00:45:03,642 --> 00:45:05,711
Sorry about the mix-up, Ted.

457
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:08,981
We appreciate what you are trying to do.

458
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:12,885
The river flooding
seems worse each year.

459
00:45:16,889 --> 00:45:20,358
Hey, buddy. You did your best.

460
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:24,330
Dr. Lady Scientist?

461
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:27,666
Now that I know you're not
completely despicable,

462
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:30,469
you can call me Naja.

463
00:45:31,236 --> 00:45:32,272
Okay.

464
00:45:33,372 --> 00:45:37,810
Naja. So, there's nothing we can do
to fix the communications?

465
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:38,978
Nothing.

466
00:45:46,552 --> 00:45:49,287
What? What is it, George?

467
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:53,092
I do hear something.

468
00:45:53,192 --> 00:45:55,894
Like a helicopter?

469
00:46:08,808 --> 00:46:12,244
<i>Mr. Houston, come in.
Come in, Mister Houston.</i>

470
00:46:12,344 --> 00:46:15,280
<i>We've had a sighting
of a monkey in a spacesuit.</i>

471
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:16,383
Where is he?

472
00:46:16,483 --> 00:46:19,318
<i>A small village 30 miles east
of the Big River.</i>

473
00:46:19,418 --> 00:46:21,286
I'm on my way!

474
00:46:21,386 --> 00:46:25,358
What did I tell ya, Andrew?
I knew I'd find our monkey.

475
00:46:25,858 --> 00:46:28,093
Good job, sir.

476
00:46:35,134 --> 00:46:36,902
It's turned around.

477
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:39,538
Wait! Wait!

478
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:43,075
It's gone.

479
00:46:49,314 --> 00:46:51,316
We're stranded.

480
00:46:51,583 --> 00:46:55,254
I want to go home to my city,
where it's nice and safe,

481
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:58,824
and my dry cleaner
expects me every Monday.

482
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,561
Get your hat on.

483
00:47:05,064 --> 00:47:08,634
Before you get all misty-eye
about your dry cleaned life,

484
00:47:08,734 --> 00:47:11,337
you should see something first.

485
00:47:23,782 --> 00:47:27,419
Looks like you made
a new friend, George.

486
00:47:30,923 --> 00:47:34,700
<i>There's a place where the air is clean</i>

487
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:40,883
<i>The trees are towering,
the grass is green</i>

488
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:45,270
<i>And the sun smiles down</i>

489
00:47:49,341 --> 00:47:53,679
<i>Feel the power and embrace the call</i>

490
00:47:53,779 --> 00:47:58,484
<i>Take it in before it's all gone</i>

491
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:01,453
- <i>Here's your chance</i>
- Hi.

492
00:48:01,553 --> 00:48:03,956
<i>Grab it now</i>

493
00:48:06,091 --> 00:48:08,911
<i>And the dreams you long for</i>

494
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:12,869
<i>Can all be found right here</i>

495
00:48:15,234 --> 00:48:19,822
<i>It's the beautiful wild</i>

496
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:24,443
<i>So full of strength and majesty</i>

497
00:48:24,543 --> 00:48:28,280
<i>It's the beautiful wild</i>

498
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:32,017
<i>Lift up your heart</i>

499
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:36,254
<i>Open your eyes and see</i>

500
00:48:44,096 --> 00:48:47,398
<i>Every inch out here is so alive</i>

501
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:54,006
<i>Where the hidden and the strong survive</i>

502
00:48:54,106 --> 00:48:58,810
<i>It's the way it's always been</i>

503
00:49:00,946 --> 00:49:02,347
<i>Yeah</i>

504
00:49:02,447 --> 00:49:06,818
<i>New experiences everywhere</i>

505
00:49:06,918 --> 00:49:12,324
<i>Just look closer, can you see it there?</i>

506
00:49:12,424 --> 00:49:17,395
<i>The surprises never end</i>

507
00:49:19,131 --> 00:49:21,433
<i>And the more you see</i>

508
00:49:21,533 --> 00:49:27,206
<i>The more you're left in awe</i>

509
00:49:27,306 --> 00:49:28,346
<i>Yeah!</i>

510
00:49:28,446 --> 00:49:33,045
<i>It's the beautiful wild</i>

511
00:49:33,145 --> 00:49:35,948
<i>Lift up your heart</i>

512
00:49:36,048 --> 00:49:41,086
<i>Open your eyes and see</i>

513
00:49:42,387 --> 00:49:44,756
This does kind of grow on you.

514
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:46,659
- Ya think?
- Yeah.

515
00:49:47,559 --> 00:49:50,495
That was fun. Kind of...

516
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:55,834
Exciting, yeah. Yes, I guess so.

517
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:05,277
Well, that explains why
our communications are out.

518
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:08,180
The antenna on the dam
has been knocked down.

519
00:50:10,515 --> 00:50:15,020
But they'll fix it soon.
Can't live without our cell phones.

520
00:50:18,657 --> 00:50:20,876
I wonder how that could have happened.

521
00:50:21,526 --> 00:50:25,197
Hey, is there any chance that's the tower
where the RDS is supposed to go?

522
00:50:26,865 --> 00:50:28,334
It sure is.

523
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:48,286
What is it, George?

524
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:55,426
- The space capsule!
- Let me see.

525
00:50:57,896 --> 00:51:00,265
Oh, not good.

526
00:51:00,365 --> 00:51:03,352
It's across the Forsaken Ravine.

527
00:51:07,772 --> 00:51:11,276
You think the RDS
is still on board the capsule?

528
00:51:14,813 --> 00:51:17,031
You want us to go get it?

529
00:51:19,818 --> 00:51:23,555
I don't know, George.
You heard what Dr. Kulinda said earlier.

530
00:51:23,655 --> 00:51:28,093
She used words like "ravine"
and "forsaken."

531
00:51:29,728 --> 00:51:33,198
He's right. I don't think
you can get across.

532
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:39,138
George, you heard the doctor.

533
00:51:39,238 --> 00:51:41,507
They'll fix the cell tower,
we'll call Houston,

534
00:51:41,607 --> 00:51:43,776
and then you'll finish the mission.

535
00:51:59,090 --> 00:52:00,692
Good day.

536
00:52:00,792 --> 00:52:04,329
Andrew, tell 'em we're looking
for a monkey in a spacesuit.

537
00:52:04,429 --> 00:52:09,334
We are looking for a monkey
in a spacesuit.

538
00:52:09,434 --> 00:52:11,270
Not in English.

539
00:52:11,970 --> 00:52:14,339
We speak English.

540
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:18,677
Well done, Andrew.
Have you seen the monkey?

541
00:52:27,552 --> 00:52:29,087
You're not my monkey!

542
00:52:29,187 --> 00:52:33,258
And I don't suppose you're going to be able
to tell me where you found that suit?

543
00:52:36,461 --> 00:52:39,198
Well, Andrew, back to our search.

544
00:52:39,298 --> 00:52:41,367
Sir, you better take a look at this.

545
00:52:41,967 --> 00:52:44,536
There's a category 5 storm approaching.

546
00:52:45,136 --> 00:52:48,473
One, two, three, four, five.
That's a lot of categories.

547
00:52:48,573 --> 00:52:51,910
Better have the search team
return to base. Us, too.

548
00:52:52,010 --> 00:52:54,479
What about Ted and George?

549
00:52:54,579 --> 00:52:56,882
Oh, this is not good.

550
00:52:56,982 --> 00:53:01,720
I did not need a storm now, Andrew.
I did not need this storm.

551
00:53:10,662 --> 00:53:13,098
George, what's going on?

552
00:53:19,674 --> 00:53:24,043
- That's some storm.
- Rain's coming. Better get prepared.

553
00:53:24,676 --> 00:53:28,614
- I see. Is it gonna flood?
- I hope not.

554
00:53:30,682 --> 00:53:34,586
Gee, I wish we could let Mr. Houston
know about the capsule right now.

555
00:53:34,686 --> 00:53:40,157
I do, too. There's a good chance
the rain will wash it away.

556
00:53:42,093 --> 00:53:43,996
But then the RDS could get destroyed.

557
00:53:44,096 --> 00:53:46,632
That could be the end
of Project Stop Flooding.

558
00:53:47,298 --> 00:53:49,134
I'm afraid so, Ted.

559
00:53:49,534 --> 00:53:51,336
No.

560
00:53:53,872 --> 00:53:55,440
Now, I'm sorry, George.

561
00:53:55,540 --> 00:54:00,045
I know you want to get the RDS,
but you know it's impossible.

562
00:54:01,646 --> 00:54:04,516
Well, it's very dangerous.

563
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:07,269
But maybe not impossible.

564
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:12,391
No, it's not a good idea.

565
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:18,096
No, we're not going.

566
00:54:24,002 --> 00:54:26,471
You agree with me, right?

567
00:54:27,072 --> 00:54:31,076
Don't ask my opinion.
You don't want to hear it.

568
00:54:39,584 --> 00:54:42,487
Okay. Let's give it a shot.

569
00:54:47,092 --> 00:54:49,261
Good luck. I wish I could go with you,

570
00:54:49,361 --> 00:54:52,063
but I have to stay here
and take care of the animals.

571
00:54:52,163 --> 00:54:57,436
Hopefully, the old bridge is still there.
And hopefully, it's still passable.

572
00:54:59,438 --> 00:55:01,840
Almost got it.

573
00:55:03,108 --> 00:55:05,844
Here we go. Bye!

574
00:55:14,786 --> 00:55:16,221
Careful with that map, George.

575
00:55:16,321 --> 00:55:20,625
That's what's keeping this adventure
from becoming a bad-venture.

576
00:55:20,972 --> 00:55:23,060
I just thought of that.

577
00:55:33,404 --> 00:55:36,603
Strich? What are you doing here?

578
00:55:56,394 --> 00:55:57,462
Well...

579
00:55:58,163 --> 00:56:00,598
guess this is where we get out.

580
00:56:04,169 --> 00:56:06,404
Oh, no.

581
00:56:09,841 --> 00:56:13,111
Come on. Come on, everyone.

582
00:56:21,686 --> 00:56:25,890
I don't believe it.
We made it to the capsule.

583
00:56:28,993 --> 00:56:33,397
We almost made it to the capsule.

584
00:56:37,536 --> 00:56:42,240
Sorry, George. I know
you really wanted to get there.

585
00:56:48,713 --> 00:56:50,582
George...

586
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:56,789
I don't think that bridge is safe.

587
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:01,993
I don't think it's on the same
continent as safe.

588
00:57:08,233 --> 00:57:10,301
Oh, boy.

589
00:57:19,878 --> 00:57:22,314
George, this is nuts!

590
00:57:25,717 --> 00:57:29,588
Don't look down, Ted.
In fact, don't look anywhere.

591
00:57:41,933 --> 00:57:43,768
Sweet.

592
00:57:49,808 --> 00:57:52,477
I got the hang of this adventure thing.

593
00:57:52,577 --> 00:57:54,579
Follow me, George.

594
00:58:01,319 --> 00:58:03,187
Crocodile!

595
00:58:18,469 --> 00:58:22,190
Perhaps you haven't noticed!
I'm not a monkey!

596
00:58:26,010 --> 00:58:28,212
Oh, boy.

597
00:58:29,681 --> 00:58:31,750
Monkey see, monkey do!

598
00:58:37,288 --> 00:58:39,057
Yes!

599
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:05,930
Looks good as new.

600
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:14,726
The radio still works?
This is our ticket home, George!

601
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:17,629
Let's see. There must be a switch.

602
00:59:27,972 --> 00:59:31,175
Hello. Can anyone hear me?

603
00:59:32,176 --> 00:59:34,546
Other than those lion cubs?

604
00:59:35,246 --> 00:59:40,785
George, don't you know if there's cubs,
that probably means there's a mama?

605
00:59:43,354 --> 00:59:45,323
Or papa?

606
00:59:56,801 --> 00:59:59,003
Let's get out of here.

607
01:00:54,259 --> 01:00:56,962
What are you doing, George?
We don't want him to follow us.

608
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:01,533
Oh, you're saving the lion.

609
01:01:02,133 --> 01:01:04,335
Hang on, lion!

610
01:01:21,652 --> 01:01:23,588
Nice job, George.

611
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:31,730
Now I think it's our turn
to get rescued.

612
01:01:34,065 --> 01:01:38,437
All this waiting, Andrew.
I want an ETA and I want it now!

613
01:01:39,137 --> 01:01:41,673
Sir, the hot chocolate
will be ready in five minutes.

614
01:01:41,973 --> 01:01:43,141
I can live with that.

615
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:46,978
<i>This is Ted calling for Mr. Houston.
Please, come in.</i>

616
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:48,847
Ted, Hal Houston here!

617
01:01:49,180 --> 01:01:53,017
He's there! Mr. Houston. I found George.

618
01:01:53,217 --> 01:01:56,810
We got him! That's astonishing, Ted!

619
01:01:57,322 --> 01:01:59,958
And we retrieved the RDS
from the capsule.

620
01:02:00,258 --> 01:02:02,927
Holy Canaveral! You're heroes.

621
01:02:03,127 --> 01:02:04,429
Can you come get us?

622
01:02:05,897 --> 01:02:09,467
You'll have to sit tight. We can't
get to you until after the storm.

623
01:02:09,567 --> 01:02:11,136
There may be flooding.

624
01:02:11,736 --> 01:02:13,838
Oh, no.

625
01:02:16,207 --> 01:02:17,809
- Sir?
- Not now, Andrew.

626
01:02:17,909 --> 01:02:21,179
But, sir, if Ted and George
could get to the satellite tower

627
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:24,916
and install the RDS,
that could stop the flooding.

628
01:02:25,016 --> 01:02:28,787
Andrew, that's the most
ridiculous thing I...

629
01:02:28,887 --> 01:02:32,323
Actually, it would.

630
01:02:33,024 --> 01:02:36,628
Well, that's a tall order.
What do you say, boys?

631
01:02:37,028 --> 01:02:39,597
Quite an ambitious plan.

632
01:02:43,201 --> 01:02:46,371
But I've already crossed half a jungle,

633
01:02:46,471 --> 01:02:49,974
swung on a vine
and faced down a lion, so...

634
01:02:50,074 --> 01:02:54,345
What's another many-mile jaunt
through wild animals and hostile terrain?

635
01:02:56,331 --> 01:03:00,485
We picked the right crew for this job.
Bring 'em home, Andrew.

636
01:03:00,785 --> 01:03:02,854
I've locked on your signal
and I know where you are.

637
01:03:02,954 --> 01:03:07,158
<i>Go down the ravine to the Big River.
Go up the river to Louis Leakey Dam.</i>

638
01:03:07,258 --> 01:03:11,028
<i>The satellite tower is on top.
You can't miss it.</i>

639
01:03:12,563 --> 01:03:15,667
Ravine, Big River, tower. Got it!

640
01:03:15,767 --> 01:03:17,702
<i>I'll tell the dam you're on your way.</i>

641
01:03:18,052 --> 01:03:20,955
Good luck. And take care of that RDS.

642
01:03:21,439 --> 01:03:24,141
Team 6 is on it.

643
01:03:38,556 --> 01:03:40,791
The RDS!

644
01:03:41,492 --> 01:03:42,994
Oh, George, wait!

645
01:03:43,494 --> 01:03:46,631
I'm a vine-swinging rookie, remember?

646
01:03:48,533 --> 01:03:51,101
You mean me? Up there?

647
01:03:51,502 --> 01:03:53,537
Oh, boy.

648
01:04:31,509 --> 01:04:34,044
We've got him now.

649
01:04:38,783 --> 01:04:43,087
I read somewhere that animals
are as afraid of us as we are of them.

650
01:04:44,655 --> 01:04:49,026
Which means he's very, very afraid.

651
01:04:51,529 --> 01:04:53,376
No, George.

652
01:05:11,115 --> 01:05:13,318
You just sent him packing.

653
01:05:14,919 --> 01:05:16,654
Oh, hi!

654
01:05:24,795 --> 01:05:27,399
You make the best friends, George.

655
01:05:30,101 --> 01:05:33,304
Well, the good news is
we have the RDS back.

656
01:05:34,672 --> 01:05:38,376
The bad news is I have
no idea where we are.

657
01:05:44,715 --> 01:05:47,118
Looks like an old log flume.

658
01:05:50,721 --> 01:05:52,773
What? The log flume?

659
01:05:53,157 --> 01:05:56,694
Good idea, George.
It should lead us to the river.

660
01:06:03,067 --> 01:06:06,304
We'll be okay, Strich.
You can go on home.

661
01:06:09,557 --> 01:06:13,127
- Thanks for your help!
- Bye!

662
01:06:26,624 --> 01:06:29,427
- We have to be getting close.
- Hey!

663
01:06:34,364 --> 01:06:36,200
Thanks.

664
01:06:36,552 --> 01:06:39,304
I think... Yes! Look!

665
01:06:39,820 --> 01:06:41,456
The Big River!

666
01:06:46,344 --> 01:06:48,446
Oh, no!

667
01:06:48,546 --> 01:06:50,765
Does this thing come with brakes?

668
01:07:01,892 --> 01:07:04,195
Oh, no! We're going the wrong way!

669
01:07:07,665 --> 01:07:10,601
Oh, boy. What are we gonna do?

670
01:07:16,274 --> 01:07:19,209
Hey, George, that's my plane.

671
01:07:30,771 --> 01:07:32,706
We got this.

672
01:08:55,806 --> 01:08:57,375
Oh, yeah!

673
01:09:01,579 --> 01:09:02,981
Bye!

674
01:09:19,964 --> 01:09:22,667
Oh, no. The pontoon is loose!

675
01:09:23,968 --> 01:09:27,237
George, you're gonna have
to take the control.

676
01:09:28,472 --> 01:09:32,142
Sure, if I can fly a plane, you can.

677
01:09:38,315 --> 01:09:43,620
Just go straight, and when I say to,
pull back on that steering wheel thing.

678
01:09:53,531 --> 01:09:55,636
Better pull up, George.

679
01:10:02,606 --> 01:10:04,908
Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up!

680
01:10:17,021 --> 01:10:18,556
Oh, no.

681
01:10:19,056 --> 01:10:22,927
Well, nothing we can do now.
Nice work, pilot.

682
01:10:24,028 --> 01:10:26,063
I'll take it from here.

683
01:10:41,045 --> 01:10:43,914
There's Leakey Dam and the tower.

684
01:10:52,923 --> 01:10:55,192
Right, George. The dock.

685
01:10:55,993 --> 01:10:58,529
We just have to set down...

686
01:10:58,929 --> 01:11:01,431
with only one pontoon.

687
01:11:07,471 --> 01:11:09,240
Okay, lean left.

688
01:11:30,828 --> 01:11:33,196
All right, George!

689
01:11:36,316 --> 01:11:39,137
Hey! We were expecting you!

690
01:11:40,871 --> 01:11:44,909
- We need to get to your satellite tower.
- There's no way up in this rain.

691
01:11:45,009 --> 01:11:48,094
Not a problem. We've got George.

692
01:12:05,229 --> 01:12:08,031
Oh, this doesn't look good.

693
01:12:25,916 --> 01:12:28,385
It was a good try.

694
01:12:29,086 --> 01:12:31,655
After all this.

695
01:12:35,726 --> 01:12:37,994
Let's go inside.

696
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:44,355
You know something, George?

697
01:12:44,455 --> 01:12:48,572
I think this may be one of those times
we throw caution to the wind.

698
01:12:53,510 --> 01:12:55,712
What is he doing?

699
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:57,315
George?

700
01:12:58,215 --> 01:13:00,036
You ready to go fly a kite?

701
01:13:06,574 --> 01:13:09,576
Good luck, Space Monkey George.

702
01:13:57,941 --> 01:13:59,477
Yeah!

703
01:14:01,111 --> 01:14:02,296
George!

704
01:14:02,396 --> 01:14:05,015
That's some monkey.

705
01:14:10,254 --> 01:14:12,773
Is that what I think it is?

706
01:14:13,023 --> 01:14:16,827
<i>Project Stop Flooding activated.</i>

707
01:14:31,058 --> 01:14:33,094
The water's receding!

708
01:14:44,454 --> 01:14:48,025
That was amazing, George.

709
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:54,331
I'll go on an adventure
with you any time.

710
01:15:19,089 --> 01:15:25,028
Space Monkey George,
I present you with this hero's medal.

711
01:15:27,164 --> 01:15:29,517
- Don't think we forgot you, Ted.
- For me?

712
01:15:29,617 --> 01:15:31,885
- Yup.
- Really?

713
01:15:41,178 --> 01:15:43,713
Congratulations!

714
01:15:49,386 --> 01:15:52,490
Ted, George, a gift.
Next time you won't need a kite.

715
01:15:52,790 --> 01:15:54,925
Oh, my.

716
01:16:06,937 --> 01:16:08,745
Yeah!
