another chance!

than a little mistake.

00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,498
then what's going
to happen to me?

Hey, Rusty!

297
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:46,213
What were you saying
about those old tracks?

298
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:49,616
(SIGHS) Well,
nobody remembers now,

299
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,451
but long ago, in the beginning,

300
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:56,057
the trains went over the
mountain, not through it.

301
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:59,790
It was grueling and dangerous.

302
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:03,061
Sad to say, some trains
never made it back.

303
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:07,226
It was clear, the trains
needed a safer way

304
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:10,569
to deliver wishes and
dreams to the Real World.

305
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:13,576
So, they decided to try
and go through the mountain.

306
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:14,940
It wasn't easy,

307
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:17,811
but after years of hard work,

308
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,612
the trains finally
dug out the tunnel.

309
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:25,854
But before the tunnel,
there was another way?

310
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:29,825
Yep. And I'm guessing those
old tracks still exist.

311
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,020
They used to say the turnoff's

312
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,529
just a little north
of the tunnel.

313
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:39,764
So somebody could take the real
boy back over the mountain!

314
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:42,567
That's what I was trying
to tell the Tower.

315
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:43,698
Don't worry, Rusty.

316
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:45,901
I'll make the Tower understand.

317
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:49,270
All right, listen up now.
We're on a new schedule.

318
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,904
Every Dream Hauler will
take one shift a day,

319
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:53,716
and then I will...

320
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:54,876
Um... Pardon me.

321
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,512
What? Not now.

322
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:58,053
But Rusty says
that someone can...

323
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,488
(EXCLAIMS)
Can't you see I'm busy?

324
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:02,787
The first shift is on
their way to the tunnel.

325
