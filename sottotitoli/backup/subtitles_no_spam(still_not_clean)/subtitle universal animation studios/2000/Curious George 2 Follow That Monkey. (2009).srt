1
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:14,704
Good morning, George!

2
00:01:26,135 --> 00:01:28,673
Up she goes!

3
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:37,430
Thanks, George!

4
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:26,151
Hey! The comics are good today, George!

5
00:02:28,322 --> 00:02:31,359
Okay, I'll put it on your tab. Enjoy!

6
00:04:00,665 --> 00:04:03,037
Okay. Okay. Okay.

7
00:04:04,168 --> 00:04:05,710
Now I'm awake.

8
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:13,049
7:45? Oh, no, I'm late!

9
00:04:16,514 --> 00:04:17,545
Oh!

10
00:04:29,527 --> 00:04:32,018
Sorry, George, I don't have time
for the paper today.

11
00:04:32,113 --> 00:04:34,105
I'm late for my meeting
with Mr Bloomsberry.

12
00:04:34,198 --> 00:04:35,657
Wish me luck!

13
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:47,419
Reason 12, I organised
all the pencils in the museum

14
00:04:47,503 --> 00:04:49,875
according to size and sharpness.

15
00:04:49,964 --> 00:04:53,748
Reason 24, I arranged for the toothbrushes
of the British royalty exhibit...

16
00:04:53,843 --> 00:04:57,591
Well, the display case, whatever.

17
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:01,929
Reason 33, I colour-coded
the colour-code labels.

18
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:05,348
Sorry I'm late, Mr Bloomsberry.

19
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:06,552
Fore!

20
00:05:06,647 --> 00:05:07,762
Whoa!

21
00:05:11,235 --> 00:05:14,320
Since you announced your retirement,
I've been thinking,

22
00:05:14,405 --> 00:05:17,406
and, well, I've put together 50 reasons,

23
00:05:17,491 --> 00:05:20,907
35 sub-reasons and a handful
of compelling arguments

24
00:05:20,995 --> 00:05:22,822
why, of all the candidates to replace you,

25
00:05:22,914 --> 00:05:24,574
- I should...
- Ted,

26
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,992
you're not one of the candidates.

27
00:05:29,212 --> 00:05:30,410
Oh...

28
00:05:31,547 --> 00:05:33,623
Thanks for seeing me, sir. I...

29
00:05:33,716 --> 00:05:35,709
You're the only candidate.

30
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,968
- I am?
- Yes!

31
00:05:38,763 --> 00:05:41,301
I couldn't imagine leaving
the Bloomsberry Museum

32
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:43,217
in the hands of anybody else.

33
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:45,634
- Not even Junior Bloomsberry?
- My son?

34
00:05:45,728 --> 00:05:48,848
Heavens, no! He has other ambitions.

35
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:54,226
You've earned this, Ted.

36
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:58,526
Me, a museum director!

37
00:05:59,742 --> 00:06:02,529
And all you've got to do is get approved
by the Board of Directors

38
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,280
at their annual meeting next week.

39
00:06:04,372 --> 00:06:05,996
The Board of Directors?

40
00:06:06,082 --> 00:06:10,827
But they're powerful, intimidating men,
with moustaches!

41
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,327
And male pattern baldness.

42
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:17,671
Relax, Ted. They're just as scared of you
as you are of them.

43
00:06:18,636 --> 00:06:20,545
- Really?
- Absolutely.

44
00:06:22,098 --> 00:06:23,841
No, wait, that's bears.

45
00:06:23,933 --> 00:06:27,218
Anyway, just tell the Board
your vision for the museum.

46
00:06:27,311 --> 00:06:29,351
Make them believe in you.

47
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:31,183
Inspire them.

48
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,430
No...

49
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:39,696
Huh? Oh! Oh!

50
00:06:39,782 --> 00:06:40,861
Okay.

51
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:43,026
Sure, I can do that.

52
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:56,215
Ted, all of your hard work is finally
paying off, and I'm very proud of you.

53
00:06:56,841 --> 00:07:02,001
But even future museum directors
need to take a little time off.

54
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:04,050
But I've only got one week

55
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:07,675
to put together my whole
"Priorities for the Future" presentation.

56
00:07:07,768 --> 00:07:10,094
Most people only talk about the future.
Not me.

57
00:07:10,187 --> 00:07:12,097
I put it in a binder!

58
00:07:16,027 --> 00:07:17,058
Hi, George.

59
00:07:21,324 --> 00:07:22,569
What?

60
00:07:30,124 --> 00:07:32,081
- You want to see the elephant?
- Uh-huh.

61
00:07:32,168 --> 00:07:34,291
Sorry, George. Not today.

62
00:07:35,713 --> 00:07:38,038
I gotta pick the colours for my bar graphs.

63
00:07:39,217 --> 00:07:41,542
Today, I'm thinking earth tones.

64
00:07:43,137 --> 00:07:46,802
- Has anybody seen my bar graphs?
- Bar graphs.

65
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,223
Hey! Mustard's a good colour.

66
00:07:51,062 --> 00:07:56,187
Ted, all this important stuff
isn't the most important stuff.

67
00:07:57,068 --> 00:08:00,022
You need to think about your loved ones.

68
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:03,528
You mean George?
I think of him all the time.

69
00:08:04,575 --> 00:08:06,698
Those aren't toys, George!

70
00:08:07,662 --> 00:08:10,117
See? Just thought of him again.

71
00:08:11,082 --> 00:08:15,329
Ted, the people you really care about,
and who care about you,

72
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:17,412
need your attention now.

73
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:22,208
Or there may not be a "later."
Do you understand?

74
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:30,054
Sure, I understand! I do!

75
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:36,812
Hey, George! Pack your smile!
We're going to see the elephant!

76
00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:45,897
You see? I totally caught your drift!
We are so in sync!

77
00:08:46,367 --> 00:08:49,119
- See you later, Maggie.
- Bye-bye!

78
00:08:52,123 --> 00:08:54,115
Hey! You wanna come, too?

79
00:09:09,307 --> 00:09:10,635
Peculiar.

80
00:09:18,441 --> 00:09:21,358
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>direct your eyes centre-stage</i>

81
00:09:21,444 --> 00:09:25,062
<i>as we present, direct from London,</i>
<i>that's in England,</i>

82
00:09:25,156 --> 00:09:27,314
<i>the great Piccadilly!</i>

83
00:09:33,915 --> 00:09:35,622
Thank you, thank you.

84
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:39,706
I shall endeavour to amuse you
with prestidigitation,

85
00:09:39,795 --> 00:09:43,414
mesmerization, legerdemain,

86
00:09:43,507 --> 00:09:45,963
and other large words.

87
00:09:49,138 --> 00:09:52,092
Ah, Tina, my lovely assistant.

88
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:56,764
If you would kindly step into
the enchanted cabinet.

89
00:09:58,022 --> 00:10:03,562
Behold!
The insupposable metamorphosis of woman

90
00:10:03,819 --> 00:10:06,227
into water fowl!

91
00:10:12,119 --> 00:10:13,400
Ted...

92
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:24,338
And now, for an outstanding wonder,
hitherto unseen by civilised man.

93
00:10:39,855 --> 00:10:44,814
Now, tell me, does anyone here
like blowing bubbles?

94
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:49,815
Well, next time, try this!

95
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:02,741
Kayla, the two-ton juggling pachyderm!

96
00:11:12,388 --> 00:11:14,048
It's quite extraordinary.

97
00:11:17,393 --> 00:11:18,721
Oh!

98
00:11:34,076 --> 00:11:38,121
Oh, Kayla, there's no spunk in your trunk.

99
00:11:38,414 --> 00:11:40,786
No pep in your proboscis.

100
00:11:43,252 --> 00:11:45,079
No cause for alarm.

101
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:50,505
Elephants do not forget,
but sometimes they do get stage fright.

102
00:11:52,386 --> 00:11:56,550
Now, for the next trick,
I require a volunteer from the audience.

103
00:11:57,934 --> 00:11:58,965
Ted?

104
00:11:59,393 --> 00:12:00,769
Oh! Oh!

105
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:01,932
Right.

106
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:06,149
Yes, you, sir! The man with the yellow hat!

107
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,939
Me?

108
00:12:10,112 --> 00:12:12,817
Please, sir, join us on stage.

109
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:18,528
Gee. I have a bad case of stage blight.
Trite! Fright!

110
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,455
Obviously.

111
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:25,619
- Go! Go on. It'll be fun.
- Fun?

112
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:29,962
Okay, don't push. I'm good. I'm fine.

113
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,169
Heavens, what a fluorescent chapeau.

114
00:12:34,637 --> 00:12:36,012
- May I?
- Well...

115
00:12:36,097 --> 00:12:37,805
Trust me.

116
00:12:39,684 --> 00:12:41,142
Ah!

117
00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:52,570
Sir, I'd like you to help me
make this elephant vanish!

118
00:12:53,406 --> 00:12:56,691
All you have to do is say the magic words,

119
00:12:56,784 --> 00:12:59,192
"Pachydermatus vamoosicus."

120
00:12:59,287 --> 00:13:02,453
Pachydermatus what's-a-cus?

121
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,999
Close enough!

122
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:15,049
Thank you, thank you. I'm sure you wish
this would work on the mother-in-law.

123
00:13:15,803 --> 00:13:17,962
George! It's just a trick!

124
00:13:18,055 --> 00:13:20,926
No problem.
I'll deal with the cheeky monkey.

125
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:23,633
Oh, boy.

126
00:13:30,192 --> 00:13:31,473
George!

127
00:13:32,528 --> 00:13:33,903
Come here.

128
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,664
- Yours?
- Yeah.

129
00:13:46,751 --> 00:13:50,451
He's a tad curious, that's all.
His name's George.

130
00:13:53,507 --> 00:13:55,500
Come out, Curious George.

131
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:13,690
Yeah, thank you! Yes.

132
00:15:47,038 --> 00:15:49,576
George? Where are you?

133
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,618
Kayla?

134
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:41,922
Kayla? Kayla!

135
00:16:43,052 --> 00:16:44,795
Security!

136
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:09,108
You think this innocent act of yours
is fooling anyone?

137
00:17:09,787 --> 00:17:12,112
You can go, for now.

138
00:17:12,206 --> 00:17:14,033
If you feel like coming clean,

139
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:18,253
contact me, Danno Wolfe, Head of Security.

140
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:19,416
Well!

141
00:17:19,881 --> 00:17:23,629
Hey, boss, I'm no expert,
but I can't help but notice

142
00:17:23,718 --> 00:17:26,672
that none of these people
has an elephant-sized bulge

143
00:17:26,762 --> 00:17:28,506
underneath their coats.

144
00:17:28,598 --> 00:17:32,049
I suppose, Ms Fisher,
you think that's clever?

145
00:17:32,435 --> 00:17:36,764
But take away the elephant's water weight,
and you're left with 25 pounds of minerals.

146
00:17:38,399 --> 00:17:41,685
You think someone dehydrated
the elephant?

147
00:17:41,777 --> 00:17:44,648
A crime stuffer never
rules out a possibility.

148
00:17:44,739 --> 00:17:45,984
Next!

149
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:50,236
I suggest no sudden moves.
He's high-strung.

150
00:17:51,162 --> 00:17:55,907
Ah, yes.
The man with the mischievous monkey.

151
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,705
Not mischievous, just curious.

152
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:00,243
Where is he, anyway?

153
00:18:00,338 --> 00:18:03,208
Well, believe it or not,
George has gone missing, too.

154
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:04,497
Really?

155
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:07,838
It's not that strange.
He probably wandered off.

156
00:18:07,929 --> 00:18:09,838
He does it all the time.

157
00:18:09,931 --> 00:18:13,596
You know,
maybe Kayla wandered off with George.

158
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:18,390
- So that's your story? Your monkey did it?
- No!

159
00:18:18,481 --> 00:18:20,806
Ticklish! Okay.

160
00:18:21,609 --> 00:18:27,113
- You know, I bet they're just out having fun.
- "Fun"? Kidnapping is fun to you?

161
00:18:27,198 --> 00:18:31,492
- I suppose murder's just a party, then, huh?
- Murder?

162
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:34,329
International espionage?
Just another day at the beach?

163
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:36,073
No! No! No beach!

164
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:43,586
Listen, yellow man, I've got my eye on you.

165
00:18:44,382 --> 00:18:47,833
- Don't leave town!
- He never does.

166
00:18:50,805 --> 00:18:55,550
The local police claim a lost elephant
is not their problem.

167
00:18:55,643 --> 00:18:58,478
Doesn't matter. I've made it mine.

168
00:18:59,021 --> 00:19:02,805
- I will find your hippo!
- Elephant!

169
00:19:03,234 --> 00:19:04,265
Oh.

170
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,640
Elephant. Sorry.

171
00:19:07,154 --> 00:19:10,986
Baby elephant, alone in the big city.

172
00:19:11,867 --> 00:19:13,825
She must be terrified.

173
00:19:22,003 --> 00:19:23,413
Sinatra. Hmm.

174
00:19:23,504 --> 00:19:24,833
ABBA.

175
00:19:25,339 --> 00:19:26,668
Ah!

176
00:19:26,757 --> 00:19:28,382
Tchaikovsky.

177
00:20:05,004 --> 00:20:06,415
Tchaikovsky.

188

George, when I said no guests over
without permission,

189
00:21:28,004 --> 00:21:30,874
I am pretty sure that included elephants.

190
00:21:33,384 --> 00:21:35,590
What were you thinking?

191
00:21:37,805 --> 00:21:40,213
Peanuts. Yes.

192
00:21:40,308 --> 00:21:42,181
Yes, of course.

193
00:21:42,268 --> 00:21:43,976
Makes total sense.

194
00:21:44,312 --> 00:21:48,605
Well, I better call Mr
Piccadilly and tell him.

Come on, George.
We've got to take Kayla back home.

201
00:22:50,503 --> 00:22:54,583
If we meet anyone, I'll do the talking.
Not sure what I'll say.

202
00:22:54,966 --> 00:22:57,670
Any story that begins with
"my monkey and l" is trouble.

203
00:23:03,432 --> 00:23:04,927
- Hey, look!
:make you feel?

204

<i>- Kayla is not only the star of my show,</i>-

208
00:23:26,247 --> 00:23:29,201
Like an elephant could just walk away
and no one would notice.

209
00:23:32,169 --> 00:23:34,660
<i>- Tonight, a special report</i>-

210
00:23:34,755 --> 00:23:36,214
George? Kayla?

211
00:23:48,102 --> 00:23:49,596
George, no!

212
00:24:40,196 --> 00:24:42,687
Typical. My list just says trunk.

213
00:24:43,324 --> 00:24:45,862
Who knew there'd be an elephant attached?

214
00:24:46,244 --> 00:24:48,569
Well, the boxcar's empty.

215

George, what are you doing here?

218
00:25:19,527 --> 00:25:23,441
Yeah. I know Kayla's an elephant.
She has to go home.

219
00:25:26,826 --> 00:25:27,940
And so do we.

220
00:25:28,035 --> 00:25:32,863
I have a big presentation to prepare,
and I haven't even begun to alphabetize.

221
00:25:37,086 --> 00:25:40,585
Okay. I'm putting my foot down,
young monkey.

222
00:25:42,341 --> 00:25:44,001
AII, aboard!

223
00:25:44,093 --> 00:25:46,465
So, get out of this car, right now.

224
00:25:46,554 --> 00:25:50,005
There is no way we're
riding a train tonight.

225
00:25:54,562 --> 00:25:57,432
No. No! No! No, wait! Wait!

226
00:26:14,916 --> 00:26:17,585
Oh, my gosh, there are no seatbelts.

227
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,122
Help. We're trapped.

228
00:26:26,594 --> 00:26:27,792
Great.

229
00:26:28,137 --> 00:26:31,886
I've gone from museum director
to boxcar hobo.

230
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,307
And look at my priorities,

231
00:26:35,394 --> 00:26:38,146
my poor beautiful priorities.

232
00:26:38,648 --> 00:26:41,139
Does anybody see my pie charts?

233
00:26:48,574 --> 00:26:50,531
Never mind. I'II...

234
00:26:51,202 --> 00:26:53,194
I'll just recreate them.

235
00:26:57,166 --> 00:26:59,159
Wait. I have my phone.

236
00:27:00,878 --> 00:27:01,957
No signal.

237
00:27:02,046 --> 00:27:06,126
Come on, baby. Give me some signal.
Papa needs a new pair of bars.

238
00:27:06,509 --> 00:27:08,667
Come on. Come on. Come on.

239
00:27:08,761 --> 00:27:10,754
Wait. Now there's two.

240
00:27:11,264 --> 00:27:13,505
Now there's... Now there's three.

241
00:27:15,351 --> 00:27:17,142
Now there's none.

242
00:27:33,369 --> 00:27:35,527
George, you're in my light.

243
00:27:38,416 --> 00:27:40,622
You've seen the moon before.

244
00:27:44,672 --> 00:27:45,835
A bird?

245
00:27:46,507 --> 00:27:47,538
Oh!

246
00:27:47,633 --> 00:27:49,044
Flying. No.

247
00:27:49,135 --> 00:27:51,174
No, the moon isn't flying.

248
00:27:59,061 --> 00:28:00,604
I see.

249
00:28:01,105 --> 00:28:04,391
Well, actually, that's
an interesting illusion.

250
00:28:04,483 --> 00:28:07,817
See, the moon is far away,
and the trees are close,

251
00:28:07,904 --> 00:28:10,774
so we get a parallax effect, where it's...

252
00:28:13,075 --> 00:28:16,575
Or sometimes the man in the moon
looks down,

253
00:28:16,662 --> 00:28:20,327
sees a little monkey he likes
and follows him.

254
00:28:23,294 --> 00:28:27,374
Why don't you say good night to the moon
and go sleep with Kayla?

255
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,591
Good night, George.

256
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,225
Come on in. We're all set up.

257
00:28:49,028 --> 00:28:53,690
Brilliant! Extraordinary! Impressive array.

258
00:28:55,618 --> 00:28:57,776
Do they do anything?

259
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:01,535
Yeah! We've got security tapes,
satellite tracking,

260
00:29:01,624 --> 00:29:07,294
thermal vision, wiretaps, fingerprint
databases, spectral and DNA analysis,

261
00:29:07,964 --> 00:29:10,455
and the theatre organ.

262
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:13,219
This was the only room available
on short notice.

263
00:29:13,302 --> 00:29:16,007
But not to worry! Stand back and behold

264
00:29:16,097 --> 00:29:19,466
the future of crime stuffing!

265
00:29:28,818 --> 00:29:30,609
You forgot to plug in the future.

266
00:29:43,374 --> 00:29:45,248
Spot on, Mr Wolfe.

267
00:30:32,506 --> 00:30:35,294
<i>- Thank you</i>-

268
00:31:18,427 --> 00:31:20,052
Kayla. George.

269
00:31:21,055 --> 00:31:22,383
Train.

270
00:31:22,473 --> 00:31:23,718
Right.

271
00:31:27,603 --> 00:31:32,561
Wow, the Gateway Arch. This is St Louis.

272
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:35,651
When the train stops,
we can yell for someone to let us out.

273
00:31:35,736 --> 00:31:37,444
We're going home!

274
00:31:43,619 --> 00:31:46,110
That was St Louis.

275
00:31:47,832 --> 00:31:51,117
Okay. Okay. I'm not gonna freak out.

276
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:53,535
My cell phone should work here,

277
00:31:54,046 --> 00:31:56,372
but it has a dead battery.

278
00:31:58,843 --> 00:32:01,963
Kayla, George, cover your ears.

279
00:32:02,054 --> 00:32:03,134
Okay.

280
00:32:05,892 --> 00:32:08,809
Now I'm freaking out!

281
00:32:14,483 --> 00:32:18,980
Ms Fisher! You should hear this.
It came into the call centre as Chinese.

282
00:32:19,071 --> 00:32:21,479
- Get a translator.
- That's a monkey.

283
00:32:21,741 --> 00:32:24,991
Don't be silly. Monkeys
don't speak Chinese.

284
00:32:30,666 --> 00:32:32,908
We have a voice-print match.

285
00:32:34,003 --> 00:32:35,581
It's a monkey!

286
00:32:35,838 --> 00:32:38,590
Your powers of observation are dizzying.

287
00:32:39,634 --> 00:32:43,418
"Dizzying." I like that.
Yes, thank you, Ms Fisher.

288
00:32:45,681 --> 00:32:49,015
- There's no signal from the phone.
- Let's review.

289
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:54,887
Why would a Chinese-speaking monkey call,
then disable the phone?

290
00:32:54,982 --> 00:32:57,105
Answer? Because he's taunting us!

291
00:32:57,193 --> 00:33:02,400
Ms Fisher, this may be
the most devious monkey ever.

292
00:33:09,956 --> 00:33:12,529
George! What are you doing?

293
00:33:14,168 --> 00:33:16,837
This is my presentation to the Board!

294
00:33:21,384 --> 00:33:23,044
I have to find a way out of here!

295
00:33:28,808 --> 00:33:30,551
Just another inch...

296
00:33:35,731 --> 00:33:37,641
The handle's too far.

297
00:33:39,944 --> 00:33:42,102
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

298
00:33:45,658 --> 00:33:50,403
It's just that these three little rings
hold my entire career.

299
00:33:50,788 --> 00:33:54,287
My whole future is all
in this little binder.

300
00:33:54,876 --> 00:33:57,580
So, just be more careful, okay?

301
00:33:58,921 --> 00:34:00,415
Oh!

302
00:34:00,506 --> 00:34:03,128
No! No!

303
00:34:06,012 --> 00:34:07,422
Oh, boy.

304
00:34:16,105 --> 00:34:17,268
I'm okay.

305
00:34:17,648 --> 00:34:18,929
I'm okay!

306
00:34:19,317 --> 00:34:22,401
I'll catch up with you, George! Promise!

307
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:48,587
You've got to stop the California Express!

308
00:34:49,513 --> 00:34:51,720
- Are you talking to me?
- Yes!

309
00:34:52,516 --> 00:34:56,182
No, siree. The C.E. Don't stop for nothing!

310
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:58,179
For nobody. No one.

311
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:02,360
Except for fuel in Grand Junction.

312
00:35:02,443 --> 00:35:04,899
Listen, we're talking
a genuine emergency, here!

313
00:35:04,987 --> 00:35:07,443
My monkey and elephant
and all my priorities

314
00:35:07,531 --> 00:35:10,069
are trapped in a boxcar
headed to California,

315
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:14,027
but I was bushwhacked, literally,
and fell off the train, and...

316
00:35:14,121 --> 00:35:16,612
And you hit your head, I reckon.

317
00:35:17,708 --> 00:35:21,243
Well, yes, but I...

318
00:35:24,215 --> 00:35:25,329
Never mind.

319
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:28,715
My cell phone is dead.

320
00:35:29,387 --> 00:35:32,222
I need to make a call.

321
00:35:35,059 --> 00:35:38,724
I'll bet you do.
Well, I figure I can charge your phone,

322
00:35:38,813 --> 00:35:42,016
but you're gonna have
to call your monkey outside.

323
00:35:45,027 --> 00:35:49,357
First, I'll call Piccadilly.
Then, I'll catch up with the train.

324
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:57,905
You're saying my elephant
was kidnapped by a monkey?

325
00:35:57,999 --> 00:36:02,957
I suppose he wants 20 pounds
in unmarked bananas.

326
00:36:03,045 --> 00:36:06,913
Don't be fooled. I can
read a criminal face.

327
00:36:07,675 --> 00:36:09,584
That monkey's a lifetime offender.

328
00:36:10,094 --> 00:36:13,926
Probably started off kidnapping squirrels.
That's the gateway animal.

329
00:36:17,184 --> 00:36:19,972
Come on! I'm running out of change!

330
00:36:26,736 --> 00:36:29,440
Pilfered Pachyderm Unit, can I help you?

331
00:36:30,114 --> 00:36:32,190
Hi. I have your elephant.

332
00:36:33,618 --> 00:36:35,444
It's the kidnapper!

333
00:36:37,455 --> 00:36:38,783
Beginning trace.

334
00:36:39,123 --> 00:36:41,579
Okay, first, I want you to know she's okay.

335
00:36:41,667 --> 00:36:42,912
- Second...

336
00:36:43,002 --> 00:36:47,664
:
- I need more money.

337
00:36:48,424 --> 00:36:50,997
- What do they want?
- You need money?

338
00:36:51,093 --> 00:36:55,471
Yes! But your elephant is fine. Just fine.

339
00:36:55,556 --> 00:36:59,257
:: or $5 for 10 minutes:
- Can I just...

340
00:36:59,352 --> 00:37:01,973
<i>And that includes a subscription</i>
<i>to</i> Payphone Weekly.

341
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:04,557
I need that money!

342
00:37:06,442 --> 00:37:07,605
Nuts!

343
00:37:10,488 --> 00:37:14,023
Look, I'll talk fast. We'll be home soon,
and everything is gonna be fine.

344
00:37:15,409 --> 00:37:17,817
Well! At least I got that covered.

345
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:23,077
It's a kidnapping, all right.
But that was no monkey.

346
00:37:23,167 --> 00:37:29,834
- Nobody can fool you, Crime Stuffer Wolfe.
- The situation is worse than I thought.

347
00:37:30,633 --> 00:37:35,010
- Our monkey has an accomplice.
- My poor Kayla.

348
00:37:35,638 --> 00:37:37,963
I suspect this man.

349
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:44,185
- Blimey! I would never have believed it.
- That's because you haven't taken

350
00:37:44,272 --> 00:37:47,641
the online Crime Stuffer
Correspondence Course.

351
00:37:48,359 --> 00:37:49,557
I have.

352
00:37:50,486 --> 00:37:52,064
It's true what they say.

353
00:37:52,154 --> 00:37:55,606
You don't appreciate your elephant
till she's gone.

354
00:37:56,534 --> 00:37:58,776
You must get Kayla back!

355
00:38:00,663 --> 00:38:04,708
Gotcha! The call came from a pay phone
in Humbleton, Colorado.

356
00:38:06,043 --> 00:38:09,128
No taxi? No bus? No car for rent?

357
00:38:09,213 --> 00:38:12,831
Let me see. Would you like
the Bentley or the Lamborghini?

358
00:38:14,135 --> 00:38:18,002
- Don't you have any form of transportation?
- Just my bike.

359
00:40:13,004 --> 00:40:15,459
George! George!

360
00:40:16,799 --> 00:40:21,675
I'm going to go up to the front
and get them to stop the train!

361
00:40:32,481 --> 00:40:35,399
Oh, no!

362
00:40:37,153 --> 00:40:37,653
No!

363
00:41:05,431 --> 00:41:08,598
No one has ever been happier
to see his monkey

364
00:41:10,728 --> 00:41:12,103
and elephant.

365
00:41:12,188 --> 00:41:13,682
Thanks, Kayla.

366
00:41:15,358 --> 00:41:17,101
I missed you, too.

367
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:27,034
<i>- Thank you</i>-

368
00:41:27,286 --> 00:41:29,575
- Pick up. Pick up!-

369
00:41:30,331 --> 00:41:31,576
ETA, Ms Fisher?

370
00:41:31,666 --> 00:41:35,035
<i>- Ten minutes closer</i>-

371
00:41:36,587 --> 00:41:37,832
Coffee much, Ms Fisher?

372
00:41:41,217 --> 00:41:44,384
Hang on. We're picking up
his cell phone signal again,

373
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:46,593
from the same coordinates as the pay phone.

374
00:41:47,265 --> 00:41:49,304
Bingo! I've got them cornered.

375
00:42:00,695 --> 00:42:01,975
Freeze!

376
00:42:05,449 --> 00:42:08,653
Horse feathers! Look what you did!

377
00:42:09,495 --> 00:42:11,654
What are you doing with that phone?

378
00:42:12,915 --> 00:42:16,035
Nothing, now that you made me break it.

379
00:42:16,127 --> 00:42:20,338
- I mean, where did you get it?
- From some guy.

380
00:42:21,591 --> 00:42:22,966
Is this the man?

381
00:42:25,428 --> 00:42:26,542
Hard to say.

382
00:42:30,558 --> 00:42:33,013
- How about now?
- Yep, that's him.

383
00:42:33,686 --> 00:42:37,766
Strange fellow. He was chasing
after the California Express.

384
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:39,353
Oh!

385
00:42:39,442 --> 00:42:44,317
- And where's that train going?
- California.

386
00:42:45,031 --> 00:42:48,815
- But she does stop in Grand Junction.
- Really?

387
00:42:50,453 --> 00:42:56,573
You're always one step ahead of me.
But I'm on to you now, and I'm closing in.

388
00:42:58,044 --> 00:43:00,879
Mister, are you talking to that picture?

389
00:43:01,756 --> 00:43:03,832
I've got a train to catch.

390
00:43:12,225 --> 00:43:14,301
Hey, she's getting good.

391
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:17,931
You guys been practising?

392
00:43:19,565 --> 00:43:23,017
Sure! Kayla can probably handle one more.
Right, Kayla?

393
00:43:28,157 --> 00:43:29,272
George!

394
00:43:37,416 --> 00:43:38,875
My binder!

395
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,880
Say! We're picking up speed!

396
00:44:02,149 --> 00:44:03,525
No, no, no, no, no, no!

397
00:44:08,489 --> 00:44:09,568
Oh, boy!

398
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:39,351
Oh, boy!

399
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:06,577
Well, that was a...

400
00:45:07,715 --> 00:45:10,965
I may need some time to process that.

401
00:45:23,356 --> 00:45:28,183
You get the elephant.
The monkey and the man with the yellow hat

402
00:45:28,986 --> 00:45:30,397
are mine.

403
00:45:38,329 --> 00:45:42,161
Well, what do you know?
Fourteen minutes early.

404
00:45:44,335 --> 00:45:47,170
Danno Wolfe, Security!
Where's the elephant?

405
00:45:54,387 --> 00:45:56,759
Where's the rest of my train?

406
00:45:59,684 --> 00:46:02,388
I don't know what's worse,
blowing my career

407
00:46:02,478 --> 00:46:04,934
or having a blister on my toe
the size of Texas.

408
00:46:06,065 --> 00:46:10,015
Okay, Rhode Island.
Come on, guys! Stop goofing around!

409
00:46:10,403 --> 00:46:12,561
Seriously, if you're not careful,

410
00:46:15,741 --> 00:46:17,200
That might happen.

411
00:46:33,718 --> 00:46:36,837
You think that's funny?
You could've really gotten hurt.

412
00:46:36,929 --> 00:46:39,551
We should be looking for a road,
and instead you're...

413
00:46:40,975 --> 00:46:43,051
George! You found a road!

414
00:46:45,062 --> 00:46:47,102
Okay! A road!

415
00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:51,690
We just catch a ride east,
and we are on our way!

416
00:47:01,454 --> 00:47:02,734
Okay, this is gonna be hard.

417
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,328
Or not.

418
00:47:20,014 --> 00:47:23,798
<i>As part of our round-the-clock</i>
<i>elephant-napping special coverage,</i>

419
00:47:23,893 --> 00:47:27,891
<i>- I'm pleased to have
the great Piccadilly,</i>-

420
00:47:28,481 --> 00:47:31,766
These past 24 hours
have been hard on all of us,

421
00:47:31,859 --> 00:47:34,694
though perhaps even more so for you,

422
00:47:34,779 --> 00:47:39,108
your naked suffering on display
before a watching, waiting world

423
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,616
while you wonder
who's made off with your elephant!

424
00:47:42,703 --> 00:47:46,155
I mean, here you are, powerless,
while your elephant is in the hands of...

425
00:47:46,249 --> 00:47:49,949
- Well, who knows?
- "Who knows?" I know!

426
00:47:51,003 --> 00:47:52,960
It's these two.

427
00:48:09,188 --> 00:48:12,771
America is mad. Let's hear you speak out!

428
00:48:13,234 --> 00:48:16,318
What kind of monster
would take an elephant?

429
00:48:17,905 --> 00:48:22,366
Elephant stealers should go to jail
for, like, a million years!

430
00:48:22,451 --> 00:48:23,994
I know Ted.

431
00:48:24,078 --> 00:48:28,206
He's a good man.
There must be some explanation.

432
00:48:33,337 --> 00:48:37,750
You know, despite everything,
it's been kind of nice getting away.

433
00:48:40,386 --> 00:48:42,794
Still, it'll be good to get back to...

434
00:48:43,306 --> 00:48:46,509
"California's best"? Avocados?

435
00:48:47,059 --> 00:48:48,304
Surfers?

436
00:48:49,103 --> 00:48:50,562
We're in California!

437
00:49:00,489 --> 00:49:04,072
Why didn't someone tell me
we were going in the wrong direction?

438
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:08,240
Aren't animals supposed to have
instincts about this stuff?

439
00:49:16,130 --> 00:49:19,084
Welcome back to <i>The Network News</i>
with Hark Hanson.

440
00:49:19,175 --> 00:49:23,255
It's time to hear what the suspected
elephant-napper's employer has to say.

441
00:49:23,596 --> 00:49:28,092
I don't understand it.
Ted's the most honest man I know.

442
00:49:28,184 --> 00:49:31,932
He once walked three miles
to return change to a customer.

443
00:49:32,021 --> 00:49:34,393
Wait, that was Abraham Lincoln.

444
00:49:35,066 --> 00:49:36,857
Well, thank you, Mr Bloomsberry.

445
00:49:41,781 --> 00:49:44,865
Come on, kick it in.

446
00:49:46,619 --> 00:49:49,324
- Hey, there. Can we help?
- "We"?

447
00:49:53,042 --> 00:49:54,785
Is that an elephant?

448
00:49:57,630 --> 00:50:01,248
- Well, I'll be.
- Is that a monkey?

449
00:50:01,717 --> 00:50:04,387
- That's George.
- That's Anna.

450
00:50:05,805 --> 00:50:10,680
- Any way I can thank you, mister?
- Well, can I use your phone?

451
00:50:11,852 --> 00:50:14,723
I guess she's about two tons.
That's right.

452
00:50:14,814 --> 00:50:17,980
And I'll have to pay you later.
I left town unexpectedly.

453
00:50:18,526 --> 00:50:20,565
Well, it's a long story.

454
00:50:24,824 --> 00:50:26,235
One more!

455
00:50:40,256 --> 00:50:41,916
Well, the good news is,

456
00:50:42,008 --> 00:50:45,009
I found a freight company
that will ship Kayla back home.

457
00:50:45,094 --> 00:50:47,799
The bad news is, they charge by the pound.

458
00:50:47,889 --> 00:50:50,130
And they can't come until tomorrow.

459
00:50:50,516 --> 00:50:52,841
Well, then it looks like
we've got house guests.

460
00:50:58,065 --> 00:51:00,521
They're having a pretty good time.

461
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:07,614
That's my girl!

462
00:51:10,077 --> 00:51:13,742
- Seems like it's your turn, Ted.
- Me? Oh, no. No.

463
00:51:13,998 --> 00:51:18,126
Jumping into hay from a great height
is not my idea of...

464
00:51:18,461 --> 00:51:19,955
Whoa!

465
00:51:22,924 --> 00:51:24,916
Hey, that wasn't so bad.

466
00:51:27,845 --> 00:51:30,301
Okay, I could have lived
without that, though.

467
00:52:04,382 --> 00:52:05,580
Hey!

468
00:52:26,028 --> 00:52:27,226
George, those are dirty.

469
00:52:27,321 --> 00:52:30,986
They should be washed,
and sanitised, and pasteurised and...

470
00:52:32,743 --> 00:52:36,788
These are amazing!
It's like there's a party in my mouth!

471
00:53:17,038 --> 00:53:19,196
- Come on, Ted!
- Come on in!

472
00:53:35,556 --> 00:53:39,554
- Clear the pool!
- No. No! No! No!

473
00:53:49,987 --> 00:53:51,612
Where's my bathing suit?

474
00:53:58,579 --> 00:54:02,280
What a day.
I haven't had this much fun since...

475
00:54:02,375 --> 00:54:05,874
Well, probably the week I first met George.
Remember?

476
00:54:09,048 --> 00:54:11,800
Yes. Peekaboo.

477
00:54:12,426 --> 00:54:16,294
Chased by a rhino. Bitten by giant bugs.

478
00:54:17,098 --> 00:54:18,640
Good times.

479
00:54:19,850 --> 00:54:21,510
The paper's here!

480
00:54:23,729 --> 00:54:26,600
- George loves the comics.
- Be my guest.

481
00:54:29,110 --> 00:54:32,561
Oh, my gosh. Look!
They've got a story about Kayla!

482
00:54:34,949 --> 00:54:37,866
Kayla came from the California Animal Park?

483
00:54:39,870 --> 00:54:42,824
And these other two elephants
are her brother and sister?

484
00:54:48,629 --> 00:54:51,630
You knew all that before,
didn't you, George?

485
00:54:53,009 --> 00:54:57,421
That's why you brought us to California.
So Kayla could see her family.

486
00:55:05,229 --> 00:55:09,179
Hey, look! They've got a picture
of you and George, too!

487
00:55:09,942 --> 00:55:10,973
Huh?

488
00:55:13,487 --> 00:55:17,900
What? That's impossible!
I called! It was taken care of!

489
00:55:24,498 --> 00:55:26,491
<i>- Mr Bloomsberry?</i>
- Ted?

490
00:55:26,584 --> 00:55:29,704
Where are you?
People think you stole an elephant!

491
00:55:30,296 --> 00:55:32,123
I know! It's crazy!

492
00:55:36,052 --> 00:55:37,795
Well, it's a little crazy.

493
00:55:38,596 --> 00:55:42,380
The museum's swarming with people!
Everyone's looking for you.

494
00:55:42,725 --> 00:55:45,014
<i>- For me?</i>
- And George!

495
00:55:45,102 --> 00:55:49,230
- It's all over the news!
:: But I called!

496
00:55:50,858 --> 00:55:52,650
Do you think this will affect
the Board's decision?

497
00:55:52,735 --> 00:55:56,484
- Forget the Board! You may go to jail!
- Jail?

498
00:56:05,039 --> 00:56:06,699
I got you!

499
00:56:07,166 --> 00:56:10,120
Listen, Mr Bloomsberry.
I'll get this all straightened out.

500
00:56:10,211 --> 00:56:12,702
We'll be home tomorrow! I promise!

501
00:56:15,716 --> 00:56:18,717
So, you're not taking Kayla
to see her family?

502
00:56:21,222 --> 00:56:23,049
I never was. I can't!

503
00:56:29,397 --> 00:56:31,105
I'm sorry, George.

504
00:56:37,530 --> 00:56:41,610
George, listen to me, okay?
I know you want Kayla to see her family,

505
00:56:41,701 --> 00:56:45,070
but Mr Piccadilly has been looking for her
and wants her back.

506
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:50,614
No, George! We're in big trouble!

507
00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:54,577
The big, legal, "Go directly to jail,
do not pass Go" kind.

508
00:56:54,672 --> 00:56:56,546
Don't you understand?

509
00:57:00,845 --> 00:57:05,174
I know you didn't mean to get us
into this mess, but you have.

510
00:57:05,766 --> 00:57:07,510
And it ends now.

511
00:57:18,779 --> 00:57:22,777
Look, I'm sorry!
I just don't have any other choice!

512
00:57:28,122 --> 00:57:29,949
Still friends?

513
00:57:36,464 --> 00:57:40,462
- Come on, Anna. Let's get ready for bed.
- Okay.

514
00:59:01,007 --> 00:59:04,458
- Morning, Ted. Sleep well?
- Not a wink.

515
00:59:05,052 --> 00:59:08,053
Do you suppose
they'll let me keep my hat in prison?

516
00:59:08,139 --> 00:59:12,302
Hang in there, Ted. I figure this
mess will get straightened out.

517
00:59:13,185 --> 00:59:14,596
You think?

518
00:59:15,104 --> 00:59:16,183
But then what?

519
00:59:16,272 --> 00:59:20,898
What museum is gonna hire a famous
fugitive from justice as their director?

520
00:59:21,277 --> 00:59:22,937
You sure do worry a lot.

521
00:59:23,404 --> 00:59:28,232
Well, let's see. I'm wanted in
24 states, I'm hated in all 50,

522
00:59:28,326 --> 00:59:31,206
my career is down the toilet,
and George and I will end up on the streets

523
00:59:31,287 --> 00:59:33,576
with a tin cup, playing the hurdy-gurdy!

524
00:59:33,664 --> 00:59:34,862
You bet I'm worried!

525
00:59:36,959 --> 00:59:40,660
Yep, guess you're right.
Can't get any worse than that.

526
00:59:42,131 --> 00:59:43,376
Right.

527
01:00:02,902 --> 01:00:05,357
Yeah, can't get any worse.

528
01:00:06,656 --> 01:00:07,984
Guess not.

529
01:00:11,827 --> 01:00:13,108
Wait up!

530
01:00:16,624 --> 01:00:19,293
So, what am I worried about?

531
01:00:22,129 --> 01:00:24,455
Come on, George! Come on, Kayla!

532
01:00:24,549 --> 01:00:27,834
If we're gonna make it to the animal park,
we'd better get moving!

533
01:00:30,012 --> 01:00:34,473
Why not? If things can't get any worse,
they can only get better, right?

534
01:00:35,768 --> 01:00:38,971
So let's have an elephant family reunion!

535
01:00:41,691 --> 01:00:44,775
Okay! Okay! I'm happy, too! I'm happy!

536
01:00:45,111 --> 01:00:47,399
The park's just beyond
the Golden Gate Bridge.

537
01:00:52,827 --> 01:00:54,155
This ain't good.

538
01:00:59,584 --> 01:01:03,664
- Nobody move!
- Mr Wolfe! I'm so glad you're here!

539
01:01:04,130 --> 01:01:08,210
- Finally, we can clear this up.
- I told you not to leave town!

540
01:01:08,301 --> 01:01:10,589
I tried not to. Believe me.

541
01:01:11,345 --> 01:01:13,338
- You know, it's a funny story, really...
- Quiet!

542
01:01:13,431 --> 01:01:17,345
Don't worry, Kayla.
Danno Wolfe is in charge now.

543
01:01:19,937 --> 01:01:22,345
Out of my way, banana breath.

544
01:01:23,858 --> 01:01:26,016
- Leave him alone!
- Go ahead.

545
01:01:27,028 --> 01:01:30,693
I've taken an eight-week
Internet course in karate.

546
01:01:30,781 --> 01:01:33,070
- No!
- Hang on, Anna.

547
01:01:38,372 --> 01:01:39,535
Oh, please. That old trick?

548
01:01:44,712 --> 01:01:47,250
Pilot! Do something!

549
01:01:51,677 --> 01:01:53,717
<i>That's a 10-4, boss!</i>

550
01:02:09,904 --> 01:02:12,193
You're all in my custody now!

551
01:02:12,823 --> 01:02:14,567
Don't make me come out of this barrel!

552
01:02:15,034 --> 01:02:17,821
Sorry, Mr Wolfe.
I made a promise to my monkey.

553
01:02:17,912 --> 01:02:19,739
I'm taking Kayla to see her family.

554
01:02:24,710 --> 01:02:26,039
My backup.

555
01:02:27,505 --> 01:02:29,332
You have to hide. Now!

556
01:02:29,757 --> 01:02:33,208
Not so easy with an elephant,
a monkey and a bright yellow suit!

557
01:02:34,929 --> 01:02:37,005
I've got an idea. Come on!

558
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:13,915
Great!

559
01:03:16,888 --> 01:03:18,465
Kayla, look out!

560
01:03:24,937 --> 01:03:26,218
A bus?

561
01:03:27,857 --> 01:03:29,137
No! No!

562
01:03:33,446 --> 01:03:34,904
Kayla, wait!

563
01:03:44,832 --> 01:03:46,030
Come on, George!

564
01:03:46,709 --> 01:03:49,829
Hi, folks! Here is your complimentary map.

565
01:03:53,841 --> 01:03:55,501
Apparently, she knows the way!

566
01:04:01,390 --> 01:04:02,422
That's gonna cost us.

567
01:04:16,656 --> 01:04:20,570
- Is that an elephant?
- Look out! Wild elephant!

568
01:04:35,216 --> 01:04:37,043
She sure was homesick.

569
01:04:40,888 --> 01:04:44,423
You know,
coming here was a good idea, George.

570
01:04:45,184 --> 01:04:47,473
It was all worth it for this.

571
01:04:47,895 --> 01:04:49,935
Okay, I could have lived
without the driving off a cliff,

572
01:04:50,022 --> 01:04:52,692
but I had the best time of my life!

573
01:04:53,901 --> 01:04:55,810
Thanks to you, George.

574
01:04:56,737 --> 01:04:58,529
Aha!

575
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:05,245
- Rogue elephant! Stop her!
- No! No, she's harmless!

576
01:05:06,414 --> 01:05:07,576
Kayla, look out!

577
01:05:12,044 --> 01:05:13,788
No. Hey!

578
01:05:20,177 --> 01:05:24,590
Your crime spree ends here, monkey.
You have the right to remain silent.

579
01:05:24,682 --> 01:05:26,093
Anything you say...

580
01:05:26,934 --> 01:05:28,097
chitter

581
01:05:28,185 --> 01:05:31,471
can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

582
01:05:46,662 --> 01:05:50,114
Well, we'll be on the ground soon.

583
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:56,127
George, when we land,
some policemen are going to come,

584
01:05:56,839 --> 01:06:00,338
and, well, I'm probably going to have
to go away for a while.

585
01:06:02,303 --> 01:06:06,135
But don't worry. Maggie will take
good care of you. I promise.

586
01:06:12,063 --> 01:06:14,435
I don't want to leave you, either, pal.

587
01:06:19,737 --> 01:06:22,691
The elephant kidnappers
are having a moment.

588
01:06:23,574 --> 01:06:26,279
Now I'm supposed to get all mushy
and let you go.

589
01:06:27,703 --> 01:06:31,203
You see this? Not an ounce of mush.

590
01:06:31,624 --> 01:06:34,293
- What do you want?
- Me? Nothing.

591
01:06:35,002 --> 01:06:37,707
I have everything I could
ever possibly need.

592
01:06:37,797 --> 01:06:41,581
You, the elephant, even this.

593
01:06:43,719 --> 01:06:46,637
Would the monkey like a nice,
yellow banana?

594
01:06:48,474 --> 01:06:50,680
If you can get it, it's yours.

595
01:06:54,313 --> 01:06:55,807
Stop that!

596
01:07:00,653 --> 01:07:04,733
There, there, elephant.
Here, go ahead and eat.

597
01:07:07,034 --> 01:07:09,323
The man and the monkey can't hurt you now.

598
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:15,499
What? What? What?

599
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:19,913
You are a worthy opponent, monkey.

600
01:07:26,095 --> 01:07:29,131
You're gonna have to do better than that
to get the best of me,

601
01:07:29,223 --> 01:07:31,893
Danno Wolfe, Apprentice P.I.

602
01:07:37,273 --> 01:07:38,981
Nice going, George!

603
01:07:40,234 --> 01:07:41,812
We still need a plan.

604
01:07:41,903 --> 01:07:44,857
We gotta reach Piccadilly
before the plane lands,

605
01:07:44,947 --> 01:07:48,114
let him know this was just
a big misunderstanding.

606
01:07:58,294 --> 01:08:01,745
- What's that?
- Cargo door probably popped open.

607
01:08:02,006 --> 01:08:04,129
- Again.
- I'll secure it.

608
01:08:14,268 --> 01:08:16,973
After you jump, just give it a pull.

609
01:08:19,398 --> 01:08:20,430
Uh-oh!

610
01:08:24,403 --> 01:08:25,435
Stop!

611
01:08:36,374 --> 01:08:37,405
Easy, now.

612
01:08:41,587 --> 01:08:42,916
Here goes!

613
01:09:11,701 --> 01:09:13,740
- Gotcha!
- Mr Wolfe...

614
01:09:13,828 --> 01:09:15,108
Head of Security.

615
01:09:15,204 --> 01:09:17,078
George! Pull the ring beside you!

616
01:09:29,802 --> 01:09:33,966
- I'm losing my grip here!
- Hang on just a bit longer!

617
01:09:38,811 --> 01:09:41,895
- About to plummet!
- Oh, boy.

618
01:09:47,236 --> 01:09:48,896
Earth! That's good.

619
01:09:55,578 --> 01:09:59,243
I jumped from a plane
without a parachute and survived!

620
01:09:59,332 --> 01:10:00,909
I am awesome!

621
01:10:03,711 --> 01:10:04,909
Oh!

622
01:10:08,799 --> 01:10:10,875
That was fun, wasn't it?

623
01:10:13,095 --> 01:10:15,005
Hey! Can't see!

624
01:10:18,517 --> 01:10:21,091
Didn't think the whole "no parachute" thing
through, huh?

625
01:10:21,812 --> 01:10:24,979
Come on, we've got to get
to the theatre, George!

626
01:10:25,566 --> 01:10:27,191
Oh, no, you don't!

627
01:10:32,990 --> 01:10:34,650
Hey! Wait for me!

628
01:10:50,174 --> 01:10:51,668
We must be under the stage.

629
01:10:57,390 --> 01:11:03,143
And now, for my final feat of magic,
I shall produce, from thin air,

630
01:11:04,146 --> 01:11:05,854
a water fowl.

631
01:11:12,738 --> 01:11:16,487
Who am I kidding?
There's no such thing as magic.

632
01:11:16,576 --> 01:11:17,904
- What?
- What?

633
01:11:19,453 --> 01:11:23,321
How it works is,
there are a bunch of levers and pulleys

634
01:11:23,416 --> 01:11:26,370
and a dumb little button.
You push it, and...

635
01:11:34,385 --> 01:11:36,674
Kayla! Oh, my!

636
01:11:37,138 --> 01:11:39,510
Is it you?

637
01:11:41,642 --> 01:11:44,264
It is magic!

638
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:47,891
Hear, hear!

639
01:11:48,274 --> 01:11:49,768
Oh!

640
01:11:49,859 --> 01:11:52,231
My beautiful Kayla!

641
01:11:55,323 --> 01:11:57,896
I have you now, monkey.

642
01:12:04,665 --> 01:12:05,780
Guess who's back.

643
01:12:11,756 --> 01:12:13,914
No monkey makes a chimp out of me!

644
01:12:14,717 --> 01:12:16,460
Whoa!

645
01:12:20,056 --> 01:12:23,804
Put me down! Help! Mad elephant!

646
01:12:36,113 --> 01:12:37,228
What am I...

647
01:12:37,823 --> 01:12:39,401
What am I doing wrong?

648
01:12:39,492 --> 01:12:42,528
I think you need to work
on your people skills.

649
01:12:44,580 --> 01:12:46,340
I bet they have an
Internet course for that.

650
01:12:46,540 --> 01:12:48,580
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

651
01:12:52,046 --> 01:12:54,917
Oh, boy! I'm late for the Board meeting!

652
01:12:59,929 --> 01:13:03,974
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am really dedicated to this museum,

653
01:13:04,058 --> 01:13:07,676
but between going cross-country
with my monkey,

654
01:13:07,770 --> 01:13:09,928
falling off a train, biking off a cliff

655
01:13:10,022 --> 01:13:12,560
and leaping from an airplane
with an elephant...

656
01:13:12,650 --> 01:13:15,770
Well, you know what that's like.

657
01:13:17,697 --> 01:13:19,191
Maybe not.

658
01:13:19,699 --> 01:13:23,946
It's just, I got my
priorities all mixed up.

659
01:13:26,414 --> 01:13:31,704
Or, maybe they were mixed up before.

660
01:13:34,005 --> 01:13:36,959
Because I've learned more
from one little monkey

661
01:13:37,049 --> 01:13:40,964
than I ever figured out
from all my multicoloured pie charts.

662
01:13:43,806 --> 01:13:45,633
This is what matters.

663
01:13:46,225 --> 01:13:49,559
Families, friends, loved ones.

664
01:13:51,063 --> 01:13:53,851
People, coming together.

665
01:13:53,941 --> 01:13:56,859
It's my top priority,
and it should be this museum's!

666
01:13:56,944 --> 01:13:59,649
We'll sponsor Living History days.

667
01:13:59,739 --> 01:14:04,484
Young, old, father, son,
"All for One, One for All" days!

668
01:14:04,911 --> 01:14:09,371
We'll share our past, our present,
our hopes, plans and dreams!

669
01:14:14,587 --> 01:14:18,419
Also, I have a few ideas
for some cafeteria specials.

670
01:14:22,678 --> 01:14:27,139
Hole in one! Congratulations, Mr Director.

671
01:14:28,601 --> 01:14:31,471
Thank you, Mr Bloomsberry.
Thank you very much.

672
01:14:34,106 --> 01:14:36,182
But I owe it all to George.

673
01:14:42,531 --> 01:14:43,776
Whoa!

674
01:14:43,866 --> 01:14:45,277
Hang on, George!

675
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:05,465
- Well, look at that.
- Oh, my goodness!

676
01:15:15,606 --> 01:15:17,895
- Cheers!
- You're here!

677
01:15:18,401 --> 01:15:21,651
- All of us!
- Are Tonga and Layla visiting?

678
01:15:22,113 --> 01:15:27,024
Visiting? They've joined my act!
Now Kayla has her family,

679
01:15:27,118 --> 01:15:30,783
and my act has three times the magic.

680
01:15:34,083 --> 01:15:35,246
My hat!

681
01:15:56,022 --> 01:15:57,599
What's he doing?

682
01:16:02,528 --> 01:16:04,236
Nice trick, George!

683
01:16:07,074 --> 01:16:09,530
I taught him
everything he knows.
