MALE NARRATOR:
The planet Earth.

00:01:15,285 --> 00:01:18,821
A world of constant change
and unpredictable weather.

00:01:18,854 --> 00:01:21,224
Our home.

5
00:01:21,257 --> 00:01:23,626
Millions of years ago,
it was home...

6
00:01:25,495 --> 00:01:27,230
...to the dinosaurs.

7
00:01:32,435 --> 00:01:35,671
Although these great
beasts seem so unlike us...

8
00:01:35,705 --> 00:01:37,840
...in some ways they
weren't so different at all.

9
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:43,913
Like people,
they came in all sizes...

10
00:01:43,946 --> 00:01:46,148
...and shapes and colors.

11
00:01:51,321 --> 00:01:53,256
Some could jump.

12
00:01:57,893 --> 00:01:59,829
Some could climb trees.

13
00:02:09,839 --> 00:02:11,774
Some could swim...

14
00:02:15,945 --> 00:02:17,880
...and some couldn't.

15
00:02:28,924 --> 00:02:31,193
Some could even whistle.

16
00:02:42,472 --> 00:02:45,408
And just like all
of us sometimes...

17
00:02:45,441 --> 00:02:48,378

time getting to sleep.

20
00:02:59,422 --> 00:03:02,258
Move over, Spike.
I do not have room.

21
00:03:09,332 --> 00:03:12,368
You sure do take
up a lot of space.

22
00:03:12,402 --> 00:03:15,004

it is the same thing!

Please, not tonight.

00:03:33,889 --> 00:03:37,026
Do not make the sleep rumbles.

...great creatures
first crawled up...

31
00:04:09,425 --> 00:04:13,596
...from the murky

34
00:04:18,067 --> 00:04:19,735
MR. THICKNOSE:
I beg your pardon?

35
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:22,405
Well, if it's too far back
for anyone to remember...

36
00:04:22,438 --> 00:04:24,374
...then how do you
know it even happened?

37
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,409
I...

38
00:04:26,442 --> 00:04:28,778
Well, we know it happened.

39
00:04:28,811 --> 00:04:30,746
Well, if it hadn't,
we wouldn't be here.

40
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,715
Duh!

41
00:04:35,951 --> 00:04:39,355
Yeah, but how do you know
the first ones came
from the murky ooze?

42
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:42,992
Me flier!
Family maybe come
down from high hills!

43
00:04:43,025 --> 00:04:45,428
And Ducky's
family are swimmers.

44
00:04:45,461 --> 00:04:47,597
Maybe they swam right
up from the big water.

45
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,865
Wonder where
Spike's family come from?

46
00:04:49,899 --> 00:04:52,902
Wherever it was, it
must've been a long walk...

47
00:04:52,935 --> 00:04:55,337
...because he's awful tired.

48
00:05:00,443 --> 00:05:02,011
Young ones, please!

49
00:05:02,044 --> 00:05:05,881
Ducky,
was your herd up all night
gathering tree stars?

50
00:05:05,915 --> 00:05:07,917
No.

51
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:10,686
Then please try to stay awake.

00:05:11,921 --> 00:05:13,656
That is so not fair!

00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:15,725
You were asleep, too.

a little quieter, like Spike?

58
00:05:25,735 --> 00:05:28,838
Now, where was I?

59
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:30,840
You were explaining
where we came from.

00:05:30,873 --> 00:05:33,476
Oh, yes. Well--

61
00:05:33,509 --> 00:05:35,945
I said, "How do you
know that?" And you said--

62
00:05:35,978 --> 00:05:40,450
I remember.
Perhaps we should talk
about something else.

Food gathering.

64
00:05:45,921 --> 00:05:51,427
I have had the opportunity
to study the many methods...

65
00:05:51,461 --> 00:05:53,629
...used by different herds...

66
00:05:53,663 --> 00:05:56,899
...to gain sustenance
from the green food...

67
00:05:56,932 --> 00:06:00,703
...which surrounds us here
in our fertile Great Valley.

00:06:03,138 --> 00:06:06,108
...employ
the cranio-impactus method...

70
00:06:06,141 --> 00:06:08,578
...ramming trees
with their heads...

71
00:06:08,611 --> 00:06:10,946
...to make tree stars fall.

72
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:15,017
Fliers use their wings
to fly to
the tiptop branches--

73
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,453
I know how longnecks do it!

74
00:06:17,487 --> 00:06:20,456
Yes, Littlefoot, so do I...

75
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:24,494
...but I am not talking
about longnecks at the moment.

longnecks, spike tails...

00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:31,100
Oh, yes.

But perhaps the most--
DUCKY: No, no, no!

00:06:36,238 --> 00:06:39,809

-Spike ate my
special tree stars.

81
00:06:39,842 --> 00:06:41,711

away from each other.

Ducky, you go here.
Spike, over there.

86
00:07:00,062 --> 00:07:03,633
And a perfect example of
what I was just relating.

87
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:07,002
Notice that some of
the spike tails graze...

88
00:07:07,036 --> 00:07:10,806
...while others are using
the cranio-impactus method...

89
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,808
...I spoke of earlier.

90
00:07:12,842 --> 00:07:16,579
These spike
tails are wanderers.

91
00:07:16,612 --> 00:07:20,049
They come to the Great Valley
every now and then
on their travels...

92
00:07:20,082 --> 00:07:22,785
...searching for food.

93
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:25,220
Luckily, we have
plenty here for all...

94
00:07:25,254 --> 00:07:27,590
...and peaceful
visitors are welcome.

To continue. Food gathering.

00:07:33,729 --> 00:07:36,532
Perhaps the most interesting
technique of all...

97
00:07:36,566 --> 00:07:40,202
...is that used
by hollow horns.

98
00:07:40,235 --> 00:07:43,906
They bellow so
loudly through the horns
on their heads...

99
00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:47,242
...that tree stars
just fall all around them.

100
00:07:47,276 --> 00:07:52,014
Of course, some trees
will not give up their
green food so easily.

101

reluctant is this one here,

Why would Ducky tell her mom

with Thicknose?

That not true!

I don't know.

527
00:42:36,864 --> 00:42:39,332
Maybe she didn't
want her mom to know
where she was going.

...why don't we
just tell her mom?

-You did what?

867
01:07:41,933 --> 01:07:45,304
It's okay.
Mr. Thicknose was
with us the whole time.

868
01:07:45,337 --> 01:07:48,574
Oh, yeah.
I'm sure he was a big help.

869
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:52,678
He was.
After all, he's the oldest
and wisest of us all.

[Adults gasp]

871
01:07:54,613 --> 01:07:57,716
-Sorry.
-That's okay.

872
01:07:57,749 --> 01:08:00,219
You've still got
some explaining to do,
young lady.

873
01:08:00,252 --> 01:08:01,553
I know, Daddy.

874
01:08:01,587 --> 01:08:04,823
But wouldn't you
rather listen while you eat?

875
01:08:05,757 --> 01:08:07,659
CERA'S DAD: Did you say "eat"?

876
01:08:20,606 --> 01:08:24,243
-How are you feeling?
-Better than I have in ages.

877
01:08:24,276 --> 01:08:26,578
Thanks to
Littlefoot and his friends.

878
01:08:26,612 --> 01:08:28,380
Yeah, you kids did okay.

879
01:08:29,615 --> 01:08:33,719
-You too, Thicknose.
-How gracious of you.

880
01:08:33,752 --> 01:08:38,390
Mr. Longneck,
I take back all that I
said about Littlefoot.

881
01:08:38,424 --> 01:08:41,893
He's quite
a remarkable young one.

882
01:08:41,927 --> 01:08:44,663
-You should be very proud.
-We are.

883
01:08:47,233 --> 01:08:48,800
Thanks, Mr. Thicknose.

884
01:08:54,540 --> 01:08:56,608
You wish Spike
were here, don't you?

885
01:08:56,642 --> 01:08:59,511
I would not even complain
when he hogs the nest.

886
01:08:59,545 --> 01:09:00,946
No.

887
01:09:02,381 --> 01:09:03,615
If only he could...

LITTLEFOOT: Spike!
DUCKY: You're back! All right!

891
01:09:50,662 --> 01:09:52,264
My goodness!

892
01:09:56,335 --> 01:09:58,737
Is there enough to share?

893
01:09:58,770 --> 01:10:00,506
Now, you...

894
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:04,476
Of course. You're welcome.

I never thought I'd see them
playing together again.

897
01:10:13,919 --> 01:10:15,521
It's a wonderful sight.

898
01:10:17,088 --> 01:10:18,424

Mama, you did it!
You saved him!

911

Of course I did. He's my boy.

912
01:11:26,425 --> 01:11:28,860
It's obvious who
Spike's real family is.

913
01:11:32,964 --> 01:11:35,901
We'll always be grateful
that you saved our herd.

914

us anytime you like.
Right, Tippy?

you can make all
