not pockety like now,

00:01:24,827 --> 00:01:27,763
when whole world
very different,

6
00:01:27,797 --> 00:01:30,233
back then,
there no three-horn,

7
00:01:30,266 --> 00:01:31,301
no longneck,

8
00:01:31,334 --> 00:01:33,169
not even sharptooth!

00:01:33,203 --> 00:01:36,239
No, only one type animal,

10
00:01:36,272 --> 00:01:41,244
who fill sky with mighty
screech and big floppy sound.

That's not even close
to the way it happened.

00:01:56,926 --> 00:01:58,228
Is too.

18
00:01:58,261 --> 00:01:59,562
Says who?

19
00:01:59,595 --> 00:02:02,232
My Uncle Pterano,
that who.

20
00:02:02,265 --> 00:02:04,967
He tell me
all about it
when me just nesting.

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,669
Well, he
told you wrong.

22
00:02:08,771 --> 00:02:10,640
I did not
know you had
an uncle.

23
00:02:11,707 --> 00:02:13,643
Well, um...

24
00:02:13,676 --> 00:02:16,279
That because
he go away when
we all babies.

25
00:02:16,312 --> 00:02:18,248
Go away? Ha!

26
00:02:18,281 --> 00:02:19,749
You mean
he was sent away.

00:02:19,782 --> 00:02:23,686
My father once told me that
the grown-ups kicked your
uncle out of the herd.

Wow. What
did he do?

Uh, I forget
that part.

30
00:02:27,257 --> 00:02:29,625

remember it was
pretty awful.

we were coming into

wandering from?

Away from
the cold lands,
looking for food.

41
00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:02,392
They know they can
rest here, and then
go on their way.

42
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:04,927
Yeah.

eat them all first.

you say?

Wasn't that

Wasn't what amazing,
Littlefoot?

70
00:04:41,424 --> 00:04:43,125
The way that thing
flew across the sky!

71
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:47,863
And that light,
and that noise.
And...

72

any of it?

Okay.

00:05:02,578 --> 00:05:03,613
About what?

76
00:05:03,646 --> 00:05:05,815
About what you saw
last night.

77
00:05:05,848 --> 00:05:08,684
You see, dear,
word has gotten around.

78
00:05:08,718 --> 00:05:12,054
And it's made
some of our guests
a bit, well, upset.

Upset?

80
00:05:13,656 --> 00:05:15,591
That's putting
it mildly.

81
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:17,059
There's no
reason to get
all huffy.

Bah, yourself!

84
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,031
Littlefoot,

85
00:05:22,064 --> 00:05:24,166
why don't you
tell everyone exactly
what you saw.

86
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,769
Well, I saw
a flying rock.

87
00:05:26,802 --> 00:05:28,904
There, you see?

88
00:05:28,938 --> 00:05:32,041
Nothing unusual about
a flying rock. We've all
seen them.

89
00:05:32,074 --> 00:05:33,643
Yeah, but this
one was different.

90
00:05:34,043 --> 00:05:36,446
Oh...

91
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,514
Well, it flew
real low,

92
00:05:38,548 --> 00:05:40,816
and it shined
like the bright circle,
only blue.

93
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:43,619
And it made a
crackling sound,
like fire in the trees.

94
00:05:44,454 --> 00:05:47,723
(ALL EXCLAIMING)

95
00:05:47,757 --> 00:05:51,794
Look here. Nobody else
saw this thing.
How do you explain that?

96
00:05:51,827 --> 00:05:52,695
I don't know.

97
00:05:54,196 --> 00:05:55,831
I guess everybody
else was asleep.

98
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,134
You believe me,
don't you, Grandpa?

99
00:05:59,168 --> 00:06:01,604
Of course
I believe you,
Littlefoot.

100
00:06:01,637 --> 00:06:02,772
But...

101
00:06:02,805 --> 00:06:04,039
But what?

102
00:06:04,073 --> 00:06:09,679
But perhaps you saw
a flying rock that only
seemed different.

103
00:06:09,712 --> 00:06:12,748
Perhaps you were
still a little sleepy.

104
00:06:12,782 --> 00:06:16,619
Or maybe it was
something you saw in a dream.
Isn't that also possible?

105
00:06:17,953 --> 00:06:19,589
Well, I...

106
00:06:19,622 --> 00:06:21,891
I guess so.

like this, isn't it?

with their own eyes,
it doesn't exist.

00:06:31,133 --> 00:06:33,068
I beg your pardon?

111
00:06:33,102 --> 00:06:34,537
As well you should.

112
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:36,672

00:06:36,706 --> 00:06:38,741
see something

really seen all
there is to see?

but what are
you saying?

We're saying,
what if this was no
ordinary flying rock?

others believe
that such stones

are a message.

00:10:26,035 --> 00:10:27,369
Quiet!

181
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:31,841
You're not from
around here, are you?

182
00:10:31,874 --> 00:10:33,876
You might say that.

183
00:10:33,909 --> 00:10:37,079
Then let me tell you
how things work
in these parts.

184
00:10:37,112 --> 00:10:38,814
Oh, please do!

185
00:10:38,848 --> 00:10:41,383
This should
be fascinating.
(CHUCKLING)

186
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:45,120
First, a flying rock
is a flying rock.

187
00:10:45,154 --> 00:10:47,322
Second, fire
can't be cold.

188
00:10:47,356 --> 00:10:51,393
And third, there
is nothing beyond
the Mysterious Beyond.

189
00:10:51,426 --> 00:10:53,796
You're sure?

190
00:10:53,829 --> 00:10:56,498
Yes. And I'm also
sure I don't want any
raving Rainbow Faces

191
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:58,768
filling our young ones'
heads with rubbish.

192
00:10:58,801 --> 00:11:00,435
Please? I know
where it fell.

193
00:11:00,469 --> 00:11:02,805
We could go
find it and...
No.

194
00:11:02,838 --> 00:11:06,241
The Smoking Mountains
are far away in
the Mysterious Beyond.

195
00:11:06,275 --> 00:11:08,010
Totally off-limits.

196
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:10,312
There are sharpteeth
and fire pits.

197
00:11:10,345 --> 00:11:11,146
And that's that.

198
00:11:13,282 --> 00:11:15,484
But...
I'm sorry,
Littlefoot,

199
00:11:15,517 --> 00:11:19,388
but until
the Far Walkers
leave the valley,

200
00:11:19,421 --> 00:11:23,492
it might be better if we
didn't make any more fuss
about that flying rock.

201
00:11:23,525 --> 00:11:24,726
All right?

202
00:11:26,128 --> 00:11:27,196
(SIGHS)
Yes, Grandpa.

203
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:34,870
Of course, you
can always talk
to me about it.

204
00:11:34,904 --> 00:11:37,940
I am curious
about such things,
you know.

205
00:11:37,973 --> 00:11:39,809
I know, Grandpa.

206
00:11:39,842 --> 00:11:41,877
So, what do
you think it was?

207
00:11:41,911 --> 00:11:43,846
Well, that's
hard to say.

208
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:48,317
(LAUGHING)

209
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,418
PETRIE: My turn! My turn!

210
00:11:51,821 --> 00:11:53,288
How come
you not play?

211
00:11:53,322 --> 00:11:56,158
Ah, I'm still
thinking about
this morning.

212
00:11:56,191 --> 00:11:58,928
Except for
Grandma and Grandpa,
nobody believes me.

213
00:12:00,462 --> 00:12:02,531
We believe you,
right, Spike?

214
00:12:05,935 --> 00:12:06,535
Mmm-hmm.

215
00:12:08,337 --> 00:12:11,506
Only, um, Littlefoot?

216
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:14,143
Well, I think
there can be
a stone in a fire

217
00:12:14,176 --> 00:12:16,178
and a stone
that is cold,

218
00:12:16,211 --> 00:12:19,481
but how can a stone
that is cold be on fire?

219
00:12:19,514 --> 00:12:21,183
I do not
understand.

220
00:12:21,216 --> 00:12:23,919
No, no, no.

221
00:12:23,953 --> 00:12:25,520
I know it
doesn't make
much sense,

222
00:12:26,555 --> 00:12:27,890
but I saw what I saw.

223
00:12:29,091 --> 00:12:30,259
You believe me,
don't you?

224
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,328
Uh, Petrie not want
to think about it.

225
00:12:33,362 --> 00:12:35,797
Story too spooky.

226
00:12:36,398 --> 00:12:38,267
(STAMMERS) Sarah?

227
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,170
Uh, I don't know.
I mean, maybe if
I'd seen it myself.

228
00:12:41,603 --> 00:12:44,006
That's it!

229
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:46,842
If we found that stone of
cold fire, everyone could
see it for themselves.

230
00:12:46,876 --> 00:12:48,944
That would prove
I was telling the truth.

231
00:12:48,978 --> 00:12:50,946
But you hear
grown-ups.

232
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:53,315
Smoking Mountains
too dangerous.

233
00:12:53,348 --> 00:12:56,585
Nonsense.

(ALL GASP)

235
00:13:03,258 --> 00:13:05,027
Did I startle
you, Petrie?

236
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,296
Yes. No.

237
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:08,463
How do you
know my name?

238
00:13:08,497 --> 00:13:11,901
Petrie,
I'm heartbroken.

239
00:13:11,934 --> 00:13:14,436
Don't you recognize
your dear old uncle?

240
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:17,139
Pterano!

(LAUGHING)

242
00:13:22,211 --> 00:13:24,479
What are you
doing here?

243
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:28,017
Migrating, naturally,
like the others out
there in the field.

244
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:31,253
Boldly searching an
unforgiving wasteland

245
00:13:31,286 --> 00:13:34,990
to find a more hospitable
place to call home.

246
00:13:35,024 --> 00:13:37,359
Well, you won't
find it here.

247
00:13:37,392 --> 00:13:41,196
Don't tell me.
You must be old
Three-Horn's daughter.

248

How'd you know?

249
00:13:43,165 --> 00:13:46,468
Let's just say
there is a strong
family resemblance.

250
00:13:47,336 --> 00:13:49,504
Oh. Thank you.

251
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:53,575
Ah, and you
must be...

252
00:13:53,608 --> 00:13:56,045
Littlefoot.
Him my good friend.

253
00:13:56,078 --> 00:13:58,513
Cera and Ducky
and Spike, too.

254
00:13:58,547 --> 00:14:01,951
Yes, yes. But this
is the one who claims

255
00:14:01,984 --> 00:14:04,586
he saw a stone
of cold fire.

256
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,957
I guess you don't
believe me either.

257
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:11,093
Oh, no, dear child,
I believe you
completely.

258
00:14:12,627 --> 00:14:15,630
I know how stubborn
the other grown-ups
can be.

259
00:14:15,664 --> 00:14:18,500
That's why
I had to leave
the herd, you know.

260
00:14:18,533 --> 00:14:21,670
They simply
had no vision.

261
00:14:21,703 --> 00:14:24,139
Oh, but me
believe Littlefoot.

262
00:14:24,173 --> 00:14:25,574
You do?

263
00:14:25,607 --> 00:14:28,277
So much for
"Story too spooky."

we all agree.

265

But the only way to
convince everyone
else is, as you say,

266
00:14:34,216 --> 00:14:37,586
to go and find
that stone.

267
00:14:37,619 --> 00:14:40,389
Uh, I wasn't
serious.

268
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:42,557
I was just
thinking out loud.

269
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:46,395
Anyway, we were
about to go home.

270
00:14:46,428 --> 00:14:49,398
Uh, yeah, our
parents will be
worried about us.

271

want nobody getting
worried, now do we?

Oh, no, no.

happened to you.

from our long journey

thinking clearly.

279
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:19,194
Uh, yeah.
Well, we have to go.

280
00:15:19,228 --> 00:15:23,065
Oh. That okay.
Me stay here
with Uncle Pterano.

it's time to go!

00:15:27,602 --> 00:15:28,970
Maybe see you later?

284
00:15:29,771 --> 00:15:31,206
Of course.

285
00:15:32,174 --> 00:15:34,343
Now run along.

286
00:15:34,376 --> 00:15:38,080
Oh, and if you
change your mind about
going after that stone,

287
00:15:38,113 --> 00:15:39,448
I'd be happy to help.

288
00:15:40,182 --> 00:15:41,416

keep it shut!

00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:51,760
Why should we?

292
00:15:51,793 --> 00:15:54,429
Them brats
weren't falling
for your little act.

293
00:15:54,463 --> 00:15:58,367
I say we go find
that cold fire thingy
on our own.

294
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,735
I repeat, Mr. Sierra,

295
00:16:00,769 --> 00:16:04,773
we don't know
where the stone landed!

296
00:16:04,806 --> 00:16:08,510
Then why not simply
make the longneck
tell us where it is?

297
00:16:10,212 --> 00:16:11,413
Or else...

298
00:16:11,446 --> 00:16:12,714
Ow!

299
00:16:12,747 --> 00:16:15,617
Mr. Rinkus,
if you threaten
the young ones

300
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:17,719
it will put the
elders on alert.

301
00:16:17,752 --> 00:16:19,721
They will watch
our every move

302
00:16:19,754 --> 00:16:22,324
and our cause
will be lost!

303
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:25,094
Now, is that
what you want?

304
00:16:25,127 --> 00:16:27,329
(STAMMERING) No, no,
no, no, no. Of course not.

305
00:16:29,398 --> 00:16:33,435
Therefore,
we must be
calm and patient.

306
00:16:33,468 --> 00:16:36,438
Young Littlefoot will talk.

307
00:16:36,471 --> 00:16:39,174
And when he does

308
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:43,078
the Stone of Cold Fire
will be mine!

309
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:51,453
(PANTING)

310
00:16:51,486 --> 00:16:52,554

00:16:57,892 --> 00:17:00,662
It's a little early
for your bath, dear.
Why the rush?

313
00:17:00,695 --> 00:17:03,465
Rush?
No rush.

314
00:17:03,498 --> 00:17:07,869
Uh, I just...
I suddenly felt
kind of dirty.

315
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:11,706
Were you
splashing around in
the bubbling mud again?

316
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:15,444
No, we were just
sitting around talking
in the tall trees.

317
00:17:15,477 --> 00:17:17,246
Oh, well,
that's perfectly...

318
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:20,349
Only then
we had a visitor.

319
00:17:20,382 --> 00:17:21,650
Oh, and who was that?

320
00:17:22,717 --> 00:17:25,420
Petrie's Uncle Pterano.

321
00:17:25,454 --> 00:17:28,890
Oh, my goodness.
Here? In the Great Valley?

322
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:31,493
And he was with
some other flyers.

323
00:17:32,727 --> 00:17:35,397
I know
he's Petrie's uncle

324
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:38,433
but there's something
about him that... (SIGHS)

325
00:17:38,467 --> 00:17:42,137
Well, I just
don't like him.
Is that bad?

326
00:17:42,171 --> 00:17:44,473
Littlefoot,
you have good instincts

327
00:17:44,506 --> 00:17:46,708
and you should
pay attention to them.

328
00:17:46,741 --> 00:17:50,345
Did Pterano tell you
why he left the herd?

329
00:17:50,379 --> 00:17:54,516
Well, he said because
the other grown-ups
couldn't see very well.

330
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:57,752
What nerve!
We could see just fine.

331
00:17:57,786 --> 00:18:01,223
As a matter of fact,
we saw right through him.

332
00:18:01,256 --> 00:18:04,259
Now, Grandpa,
you haven't even
seen him yet

333
00:18:04,293 --> 00:18:06,295
and he's already
made you upset.

334
00:18:06,328 --> 00:18:09,598
Oh, I'm sorry.

335
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:12,834
It just sound like
Pterano is up to
his old tricks again.

336
00:18:13,835 --> 00:18:14,869
What old tricks?

337
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,909
Oh, well,
let's just say

338
00:18:20,942 --> 00:18:23,945
that if we had not
put a stop to Pterano

339
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:26,315
we might never
have made it to
the Great Valley.

340
00:18:26,348 --> 00:18:27,816
That's awful!

341
00:18:27,849 --> 00:18:30,552
(SIGHS) Yes, it was.

342
00:18:30,585 --> 00:18:33,955
Someday,
when you're older,
I'll tell you about it.

343
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:35,724
Oh, why do I have
to wait until...

344
00:18:35,757 --> 00:18:37,959
In the meantime,
remember,

345
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:40,429
Pterano can sound
as if he knows everything,

346
00:18:40,462 --> 00:18:42,331
even when
he knows nothing.

347
00:18:42,364 --> 00:18:43,832
So be careful, will you?

348
00:18:44,733 --> 00:18:47,302
Okay. I promise.

349
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:52,807
YOUNG FLYER: Tell me more!
I want to hear more!

350
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:54,743
Onward I flew!

525
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,156
Nobody tells us anything.

526
00:29:08,189 --> 00:29:10,091
Littlefoot is right.

527
00:29:10,124 --> 00:29:13,027
I'm sorry
this will be
painful for you.

528
00:29:13,061 --> 00:29:16,865
(SIGHS) It is time
they knew the truth.

529
00:29:16,898 --> 00:29:20,034
Well, this all began
not long after

530
00:29:20,068 --> 00:29:23,471
you little ones
were separated from us
in the great earthshake.

531
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:32,313
We, too,
set out to find
the Great Valley.

532
00:29:32,346 --> 00:29:35,884
Then, as now,
we made our decisions
as a group,

533
00:29:35,917 --> 00:29:39,921
no one opinion
outweighing the others.

534
00:29:39,954 --> 00:29:43,591
But Pterano didn't like
being part of the herd.

535
00:29:43,624 --> 00:29:46,027
He wanted to be
in charge of it.

536
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,996
For some reason,

537
00:29:48,029 --> 00:29:51,499
he felt that
he always knew more
than the rest of us.

538
00:29:51,532 --> 00:29:54,602
Maybe he know more
because he fly up high,

539
00:29:54,635 --> 00:29:56,270
see stuff
others could not see.

540
00:29:56,304 --> 00:29:58,439
(SHUSHES)

541
00:29:58,472 --> 00:30:01,910
GRANDPA: Mmm.
(CLEARS THROAT)
As I was saying,

542
00:30:01,943 --> 00:30:05,479
for some reason,
some of the herd
believed Pterano.

543
00:30:09,217 --> 00:30:12,286
Soon he led them away
from the rest of us.

544
00:30:17,325 --> 00:30:20,929
They were sure
he had all the answers.

545
00:30:20,962 --> 00:30:24,232
They were sure
he would never
lead them astray.

546
00:30:26,667 --> 00:30:27,902
They were wrong.

547
00:30:28,669 --> 00:30:30,238
(RUMBLING)

548
00:30:30,271 --> 00:30:31,305
What is it?
Danger!

549
00:30:31,339 --> 00:30:32,440
Run!
Run!

550
00:30:32,473 --> 00:30:33,574
Rockfall!

551
00:30:33,607 --> 00:30:35,576
Hurry, run!
Hurry, run!

552
00:30:41,382 --> 00:30:42,616
DINOSAUR: Sharpteeth!

553
00:30:45,954 --> 00:30:46,921
(ROARING)

554
00:31:18,286 --> 00:31:20,454
GRANDPA: He never told us
why it happened,

555
00:31:20,488 --> 00:31:22,556
only that it
wasn't his fault,

556
00:31:24,525 --> 00:31:27,295
and we never saw any
of the others again.

557
00:31:30,498 --> 00:31:35,036
But he right. It not
his fault others not
know how to fly away.

558
00:31:35,069 --> 00:31:39,707
Nevertheless, it was
his fault that they
got into such danger.

559
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:43,444
A real leader must be
willing to take the credit
when things are good

560
00:31:43,477 --> 00:31:45,613
and the blame
when they go bad.

561
00:31:45,646 --> 00:31:48,449
But not Pterano.
Oh, no!

562
00:31:48,482 --> 00:31:52,520
He just kept changing
his story and lying
and scheming and...

563
00:31:52,553 --> 00:31:55,189
DUCKY'S MOM:
Quiet! Quiet!

564
00:31:55,223 --> 00:31:57,458
We all know what
happened before.

565
00:31:57,491 --> 00:32:00,728
Right now, somebody
has got to go rescue
my little Ducky.

566
00:32:00,761 --> 00:32:04,432
Uh, yes, my
point exactly.

567
00:32:04,465 --> 00:32:08,336
Littlefoot, we need you
to tell us exactly where
to find that flying rock.

568
00:32:08,369 --> 00:32:11,772
Oh, not that
nonsense again!

569
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:15,343
Whether or not I believe
there is such a thing as
a stone of cold fire,

570
00:32:15,376 --> 00:32:17,311
that is where they
will go, am I right?

571
00:32:17,745 --> 00:32:20,081
Mmm-hmm.

572
00:32:20,114 --> 00:32:22,250
Go on,
Littlefoot.
Tell us.

573
00:32:22,283 --> 00:32:23,284
(GASPS)

574
00:32:29,157 --> 00:32:30,358
(SIGHS)

575
00:32:32,526 --> 00:32:36,197
I told them where
the flying rock is.
Why don't they go?

576
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:39,433
Oh, this all
my fault!

577
00:32:39,467 --> 00:32:41,335
You can say
that again.

578
00:32:41,369 --> 00:32:44,605
Why? If me say
again, only make
me feel worse.

579
00:32:44,638 --> 00:32:47,508
That's the
basic idea.

580
00:32:47,541 --> 00:32:51,179
We can't wait any
longer, we have to
save Ducky ourselves.

581
00:32:51,212 --> 00:32:55,516
Aren't you forgetting? The
grown-ups said the Smoking
Mountains are off-limits.

582
00:32:55,549 --> 00:32:58,652
Yeah. They'd
be real mad
if we gone.

583
00:32:58,686 --> 00:33:01,822
By the time they're
through arguing, we could
go and be back again.

584
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:03,624
They won't
even notice.

585
00:33:03,657 --> 00:33:06,094
Well, even if you
could catch up
to those flyers,

586
00:33:06,127 --> 00:33:06,794
then what
will you do?

587
00:33:08,329 --> 00:33:10,564
I don't know.

588
00:33:10,598 --> 00:33:13,101
But Grandpa
told me to trust
my instincts,

589
00:33:13,134 --> 00:33:15,336
and my instincts
tell me we've
gotta do something!

590
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:16,770
(WHINES)

591
00:33:23,811 --> 00:33:25,379
PETRIE: Oh, Ducky!

592
00:33:25,413 --> 00:33:28,816
Yeah,
let's do it!

593
00:33:28,849 --> 00:33:33,421
LITTLEFOOT: Wait up, Spike!
PETRIE: We coming, Ducky!

594
00:33:33,454 --> 00:33:36,090
I told you that
the young ones
had potential.

595
00:33:36,124 --> 00:33:38,492
Especially the
little longneck.

596
00:33:38,526 --> 00:33:39,560
Think we should
help them out?

597
00:33:39,593 --> 00:33:41,629
You know that
isn't allowed.

598
00:33:41,662 --> 00:33:43,431
Oh, yes,
I know.

(PANTING)

600
00:33:55,676 --> 00:33:57,478
Careful.
Careful!

601
00:34:00,681 --> 00:34:03,117
Oh!
Ooh!

602
00:34:06,287 --> 00:34:09,357
You are not very good
at landing, are you?

603
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:11,859
Pipe down or I'll...
PTERANO: Sierra!

604
00:34:11,892 --> 00:34:14,495
Show a little
self-control,
will you?

605
00:34:14,528 --> 00:34:17,231
Self-control my tailbone!

606
00:34:17,265 --> 00:34:19,900
I've been putting up
with that whiny little
voice since we took off.

607
00:34:19,933 --> 00:34:23,171
(IMITATING DUCKY)
No, no, no!
Yep, yep, yep!

608
00:34:23,204 --> 00:34:25,539
It's driving me
nuts, nuts, nuts!

609
00:34:25,573 --> 00:34:28,709
Look! No one is
coming after us.

610
00:34:28,742 --> 00:34:31,745
Maybe we could leave
our guest here, and
be on our way, yes?

611
00:34:31,779 --> 00:34:35,149
Oh, I would not
do that if I were
you, no, no, no.

612
00:34:36,417 --> 00:34:37,685
Leave you behind?

613
00:34:37,718 --> 00:34:39,220
No, stand on
that edge.

615
00:34:44,558 --> 00:34:45,559

you hear me?

Come out now,

we won't hurt you.

Oh, yeah, it must've
been quite a drop.

632
00:36:03,337 --> 00:36:06,707
I can't see
a thing. It's way
too dark in there.

633
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:10,878
Poor thing.
So young!
So full of life!

634
00:36:10,911 --> 00:36:13,281
So what?

635
00:36:13,314 --> 00:36:16,617
I was responsible for
that little swimmer.

636
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:18,486
And now
I've lost her.

637
00:36:18,519 --> 00:36:21,255
Well, Pterano,

638
00:36:21,289 --> 00:36:24,325
you should be
used to this kind
of thing by now.

639
00:36:39,907 --> 00:36:42,743
Ooh, I'm
very high up!

640
00:36:42,776 --> 00:36:45,446
I do not want
to fall, no, no...

641
00:36:45,479 --> 00:36:47,881
No!

642
00:36:58,025 --> 00:37:01,462
Hello? Is
anybody there?

643
00:37:01,495 --> 00:37:03,797
(ECHOING)
Is anybody there?
Is anybody there?

644
00:37:03,831 --> 00:37:07,034
That is okay. When
it comes to dark
and scary places,

645
00:37:07,067 --> 00:37:08,636
I like them better
when they are empty.

646
00:37:27,355 --> 00:37:30,391
Oh, great! We'll never
catch those beakheads.

647
00:37:30,424 --> 00:37:33,994
It'll take us all day
to climb down this side
and up the other one.

648
00:37:34,027 --> 00:37:35,729
Maybe we
won't have to.

649
00:37:35,763 --> 00:37:36,564
Look!

650
00:37:39,567 --> 00:37:41,335
Those vines look
strong enough.

651
00:37:41,369 --> 00:37:43,837
I'll bet we
could use them
to walk across.

652
00:37:43,871 --> 00:37:46,674
Oh, no, not
this three-horn.

653
00:37:48,609 --> 00:37:51,412
Cera scaredy-egg!
Cera...

654
00:37:51,445 --> 00:37:53,647
Hey! I'm not
a scaredy-egg!

655
00:37:53,681 --> 00:37:56,817
But every time
we sneak off and
leave the Great Valley,

656
00:37:56,850 --> 00:38:00,954
we end up having to crawl
across some giant ditch or
pointy rocks or something.

657
00:38:00,988 --> 00:38:03,991
Yeah?
And somehow, the
only way to do it

658
00:38:04,024 --> 00:38:07,561
is if we use some
big tipping boulder
or rotten old log.

659
00:38:07,595 --> 00:38:09,129
Uh-huh.

660
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:12,099
And I always end up
at the back of the line,

661
00:38:12,132 --> 00:38:14,368
falling off
or getting chased
by a sharptooth.

662
00:38:16,404 --> 00:38:18,639
She do have a point.

663
00:38:18,672 --> 00:38:21,141
So, what do
you want to
do about it?

664
00:38:21,174 --> 00:38:25,646
Well, uh, this time
I'm going to be the
one who goes first.

665
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:28,949
So if there's trouble,
I'm not stuck behind,
screaming my head off.

666
00:38:28,982 --> 00:38:31,552
No. This time,
I'm going to be safe.

667
00:38:34,455 --> 00:38:35,088
Um, okay.

668
00:38:46,867 --> 00:38:49,036
Careful.

doing, Cera?

get here?

698

Well, the flyers chased me
and I ran and I fell through
the top of a big cave

into a big
cold water

700
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,729

this big crawl hole
and then I found you.

(CRYING) Me not
understand why
Pterano so mean!

702

Do not feel bad. Your
uncle was not as mean
as the other flyers.

703
00:41:09,309 --> 00:41:10,944
He not?

704
00:41:10,978 --> 00:41:14,114
Oh, no, he was
very sad when
they dropped me.

705
00:41:14,147 --> 00:41:17,084

going to make you sad

* They will trip on your tail
or tromp on your toes

* Or knock you in a puddle

712

* It is not that they
mean to be mean, no, no

713

a bit of a muddle

can hurt your feelings

we go home now?

No, Cera, what
about the flyers?

745

And that Stone
of Cold Fire?

of Cold Fire really is
a magic thing?

Then it would be bad
if the flyers got it.

you doing?

01:02:17,109 --> 01:02:20,412
Maybe the
Stone of Cold Fire
is magic!

1038
01:02:20,446 --> 01:02:23,349
Maybe the Smoking Mountain
is just getting ready
to blow up.

1039
01:02:24,583 --> 01:02:27,019
Me like
magic idea
better!

1040
01:02:27,053 --> 01:02:29,155
O great
Stone of Cold Fire,

1041
01:02:29,188 --> 01:02:31,924
it is I, Pterano!

1042
01:02:31,958 --> 01:02:33,525
The chosen one.

1043
01:02:39,398 --> 01:02:42,334
You see,
I touched the stone,
yet I do not burn.

1044
01:02:42,368 --> 01:02:44,003
It is a sign.

1045
01:02:44,036 --> 01:02:45,137
Yes, yes.

1046
01:02:45,171 --> 01:02:47,840
Get on with it,
will ya?

1047
01:02:47,874 --> 01:02:51,110
In the name of
the noble flyers who ruled
the world so long ago,

1048
01:02:51,143 --> 01:02:53,545
I beseech you,
great stone,

1049
01:02:53,579 --> 01:02:56,548
bestow upon me
your gifts!

1050
01:03:02,588 --> 01:03:04,390
I said, (CLEARS THROAT)

1051
01:03:04,423 --> 01:03:07,960
"Bestow upon me
your gifts."

1052
01:03:10,196 --> 01:03:12,531
You fool!
You rockhead, you!

1053
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:16,235
Now, where's
your cold fire,
Pterano?

1054
01:03:16,268 --> 01:03:18,004
Where's your
magic powers?

1055
01:03:18,037 --> 01:03:19,405
What is the
meaning of this?

1056
01:03:19,438 --> 01:03:21,140
It means we're
taking over, see?

1057
01:03:21,173 --> 01:03:22,574
Now, scram!

1058
01:03:24,310 --> 01:03:25,411
No!

1059
01:03:26,979 --> 01:03:29,015
I should be
the leader, me!

1060
01:03:29,048 --> 01:03:32,518
Come on, you stupid slab,
show me the power!

1061
01:03:32,551 --> 01:03:35,654
No, me!
Show it to me!

1062
01:03:35,687 --> 01:03:37,123
(BOTH GRUNTING)

1063
01:03:38,624 --> 01:03:41,660
I knew it was just
a dumb old rock.

1064
01:03:41,693 --> 01:03:44,663
Oh, I wanted
to make everything
perfect.

1065
01:03:44,696 --> 01:03:47,633
I was going to
create a paradise.

1066
01:03:47,666 --> 01:03:51,070
But we already
got paradise back
in Great Valley.

1067
01:03:51,103 --> 01:03:52,604
You no
need to fix.

1068
01:03:52,638 --> 01:03:53,572
Just got to
not break.

1069
01:03:56,175 --> 01:03:56,875
Speaking of break...

1070
01:03:59,311 --> 01:04:01,313
CERA: (SCREAMING)
Earthshake!

1071
01:04:10,456 --> 01:04:14,526
We have to run
away from here!
We do, we do!

1072
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:17,096
How? We'll never
get off the mountain
in time!

1073
01:04:21,367 --> 01:04:23,269
Mama!

1074
01:04:25,571 --> 01:04:29,475
Whoa! That is
one big flyer!

1075
01:04:31,210 --> 01:04:32,411
(GUFFAWS)

1076
01:04:33,545 --> 01:04:34,947
(GASPS)
Huh?

1077
01:04:34,981 --> 01:04:38,050
Oh, Petrie,
I was so worried.

1078
01:04:38,084 --> 01:04:40,987
And, Ducky!

1079
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:42,688
As for you...

1080
01:04:42,721 --> 01:04:46,225
Honestly,
I never meant
to harm anyone.

1081
01:04:46,258 --> 01:04:48,494
Things simply
got out of control.

1082
01:04:48,527 --> 01:04:50,162
I...

1083
01:04:50,196 --> 01:04:52,398
(RUMBLING)

1084
01:04:55,334 --> 01:04:56,335
(SQUEALS)

1085
01:05:02,474 --> 01:05:03,509
(SCREAMS)

1086
01:05:03,542 --> 01:05:05,011
Ducky!

1087
01:05:05,044 --> 01:05:06,312
(SCREAMING)

1088
01:05:23,462 --> 01:05:25,197
LITTLEFOOT:
Oh, I'm so glad!

1089
01:05:26,565 --> 01:05:28,300
Petrie was right,

1090
01:05:28,334 --> 01:05:30,069
somewhere inside,
you are good.

1091
01:05:31,637 --> 01:05:33,272
Yeah, fine,
whatever.

1092
01:05:33,305 --> 01:05:34,740
Now, can
we all get
out of here?

1093
01:05:53,592 --> 01:05:55,261
(BOTH SCREAMING)

1094
01:06:00,699 --> 01:06:03,269
(SCREAMING)

1095
01:06:03,302 --> 01:06:05,571
(BOTH GROAN)

1096
01:06:05,604 --> 01:06:07,773
DUCKY: That is okay,
Petrie's uncle,

1097
01:06:07,806 --> 01:06:10,242
this is a
much nicer ride
than the last time.

1098
01:06:10,276 --> 01:06:12,444
(GIGGLES) It is! It is!

1099
01:06:21,687 --> 01:06:25,791
GRANDPA: Quite frankly,
Pterano, your behavior has
been inexcusable.

1100
01:06:25,824 --> 01:06:30,196
But, in light of the fact
that you helped save
the children,

1101
01:06:30,229 --> 01:06:32,364
your punishment
will be reduced.

1102
01:06:32,398 --> 01:06:33,565
It will?

1103
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:35,701
Yes.

1104
01:06:35,734 --> 01:06:39,538
We have decided that
you should be banished to
the Mysterious Beyond,

1105
01:06:39,571 --> 01:06:42,441
until five of
the cold times
have passed.

1106
01:06:43,309 --> 01:06:44,710
Five cold times?

1107
01:06:44,743 --> 01:06:46,612
That's so long!

1108
01:06:46,645 --> 01:06:50,249
Yes, and some of us
think it should be
a lot longer.

1109
01:06:50,282 --> 01:06:52,518
Oh, now, please.

1110
01:06:52,551 --> 01:06:54,420
None of the
Far Walkers want
anything to do with me.

1111
01:06:54,453 --> 01:06:58,357
I'll be alone
and defenseless in
the Mysterious Beyond.

1112
01:06:58,390 --> 01:06:59,691
Is that
really fair?

1113
01:06:59,725 --> 01:07:01,760
ALL: Yes!

1114
01:07:01,793 --> 01:07:04,630
Oh, let him stay,
he very sorry.

1115
01:07:05,897 --> 01:07:07,666
That may be,

1116
01:07:07,699 --> 01:07:09,735
but it doesn't
change what he did.

1117
01:07:09,768 --> 01:07:12,704
And he must
be responsible
for that.

1118
01:07:12,738 --> 01:07:15,874
PTERANO: Petrie.
She's right.
But...

1119
01:07:15,907 --> 01:07:19,178
We must all
be accountable
for our actions.

1120
01:07:19,211 --> 01:07:20,579
I'll be fine.

1121
01:07:23,549 --> 01:07:25,351
I will miss you,
Uncle.

1122
01:07:25,384 --> 01:07:27,686
Perhaps someday
I shall return
to the herd

1123
01:07:27,719 --> 01:07:30,356
and prove that I can
be trustworthy.

1124
01:07:30,389 --> 01:07:34,092
I know there is much
I can contribute
if given the chance.

1125
01:07:36,595 --> 01:07:39,131
I shall miss you,
too, Petrie.

1126
01:07:41,467 --> 01:07:44,570
Now go on, you!
You, scoot!
Go on! Scoot!

1127
01:07:45,571 --> 01:07:46,572
(ROARS)

1128
01:07:47,773 --> 01:07:49,841
Then again, (CHUCKLES)

1129
01:07:49,875 --> 01:07:53,179
there are others,
I shan't miss
at all!

1130
01:07:58,584 --> 01:08:02,421
(SIGHS) Do you think
there ever really was
a Stone of Cold Fire?

1131
01:08:02,454 --> 01:08:05,224
Well,
it was cold...

1132
01:08:05,257 --> 01:08:07,193
And there was
fire around it.

1133
01:08:07,226 --> 01:08:09,428
Oh, please.
Like I said,

1134
01:08:09,461 --> 01:08:11,497
that was
just a dumb old
flying rock.

1135
01:08:11,530 --> 01:08:13,432
There wasn't
anything magic
about it.

1136
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:15,501
Yeah.

1137
01:08:15,534 --> 01:08:17,669
Anyway,
what we need
with magic,

1138
01:08:17,703 --> 01:08:19,305
when we got
each other?

1139
01:08:20,206 --> 01:08:21,607
Hey!

1140
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:23,375
The Far Walkers
are about to leave.

1141
01:08:23,409 --> 01:08:24,876
Let's watch them go.

1142
01:08:31,983 --> 01:08:34,686
Hey, how did you
get back here
so fast?

1143
01:08:40,426 --> 01:08:42,394
Quite a sight,
isn't it?

1144
01:08:42,428 --> 01:08:44,830
Uh, yeah.

1145
01:08:44,863 --> 01:08:46,332
Are you
leaving, too?

1146
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:50,702
Anytime now.

1147
01:08:50,736 --> 01:08:52,871
That falling
rock I saw,

1148
01:08:52,904 --> 01:08:55,374
it never was the
Stone of Cold Fire,
was it?

1149
01:08:55,407 --> 01:08:56,742
No.

1150
01:08:56,775 --> 01:08:59,445
But, you see,
the stone never
really mattered.

1151
01:08:59,478 --> 01:09:02,481
It's what you did to
discover the truth
about it.

1152
01:09:02,514 --> 01:09:03,649
That is what's
important.

1153
01:09:05,984 --> 01:09:08,720
Wait! There's
so much I don't
understand.

1154
01:09:08,754 --> 01:09:11,723
Why was that
flying rock I saw
different from the rest?

1155
01:09:11,757 --> 01:09:14,693
Is there really
such a thing as the
Stone of Cold Fire?

1156
01:09:16,562 --> 01:09:18,430
Who are
you guys?

1157
01:09:18,464 --> 01:09:20,466
You have
a sharp mind,
Littlefoot.

1158
01:09:20,499 --> 01:09:22,468
Quite advanced
for your species.

1159
01:09:22,501 --> 01:09:24,236
I mean,
for someone
so young.

1160
01:09:24,270 --> 01:09:26,372
Oh, thanks.

1161
01:09:26,405 --> 01:09:28,540
Remember this,
Littlefoot.

1162
01:09:28,574 --> 01:09:31,510
There is much more
to what you call the
Great Circle of Life

1163
01:09:31,543 --> 01:09:33,945
than you can
possibly imagine.

1164
01:09:33,979 --> 01:09:36,282
Out in the
Mysterious Beyond?

1165
01:09:36,315 --> 01:09:38,650
No, as we said
to the three-horn,

1166
01:09:38,684 --> 01:09:41,019
beyond the
Mysterious Beyond.

1167
01:09:41,052 --> 01:09:43,555
For example,
when it's dark
at night,

1168
01:09:43,589 --> 01:09:46,725
all of those tiny lights
in the sky are
actually other...

01:09:46,758 --> 01:09:48,594
(CLEARS THROAT)

1170
01:09:48,627 --> 01:09:50,629
Well, that
would be telling,
wouldn't it?

1171
01:09:52,298 --> 01:09:56,468
* Life is
not a game,
my friend

1172

or for winning

01:09:59,905 --> 01:10:03,609
* And when you
think you've
reached the end

1174
01:10:03,642 --> 01:10:07,313
* It's only the beginning

1175
01:10:09,548 --> 01:10:11,850
Oh! Will you
look at that!

1176
01:10:11,883 --> 01:10:13,885
What? Look
at what?

1177
01:10:17,723 --> 01:10:19,625
RAINBOW FACE 1:
* Beyond the Mysterious Beyond

1178

ever ends there

you have friends there

1181

1186
01:10:53,091 --> 01:10:55,060
Hi, Littlefoot.
What's going on?

1187
01:10:55,093 --> 01:10:56,828
Well...

1188
01:10:56,862 --> 01:10:58,830
That would
be telling,
wouldn't it?

1189
01:10:58,864 --> 01:11:00,399
Telling what,
Littlefoot?

1190
01:11:00,432 --> 01:11:02,067
Yeah, no fair!

1191
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:04,670
What you know
we no know?

1192
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:06,372
Oh, Petrie.

1193
01:11:06,405 --> 01:11:08,039
There's so much
we don't know.

1194
01:11:08,073 --> 01:11:09,675
But that's part
of the fun.

1195
01:11:09,708 --> 01:11:11,677
Thinking about
how much we still
have to learn.

1196
01:11:12,678 --> 01:11:14,713
Hey! I know lots.

1197
01:11:14,746 --> 01:11:16,014
PETRIE: Me, too!

1198
01:11:16,047 --> 01:11:19,451
Know more than
Uncle Pterano,
that for sure!

1199
01:11:19,485 --> 01:11:22,988
He not so
smart after all!

1200
01:11:23,021 --> 01:11:24,990
DUCKY: (GIGGLING)
Oh, no, oh, no!

1201
01:11:25,023 --> 01:11:28,059
But we are plenty smart,
right, Spike?

1202
01:11:28,093 --> 01:11:30,696
SPIKE: Uh-huh.
