there have been
wonderful stories about
how life began.

There are tales of how
the Bright Circle gave birth

The only bad luck
I ever had

721

was having to watch
those crazy twins.

treats me like a baby.

on the Valley.

Maybe. But so far
we the only ones
having bad luck.

if it starts happening
to everybody?

dry up like this?

Petrie believe.
Bad luck real.

888
00:59:58,470 --> 01:00:01,140
Well... Maybe I believe it.

889
01:00:01,173 --> 01:00:04,376
If it is bad luck,
Littlefoot is right.

890
01:00:04,410 --> 01:00:07,747
We did cause it.
Yep, yep, yep.

891
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:09,982
Well, then, we'll just
have to fix it.

892
01:00:13,485 --> 01:00:14,921
We?

893
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:18,224
Who needs them, anyway?

894
01:00:18,257 --> 01:00:20,326
I'm a lone dinosaur.

895
01:00:20,359 --> 01:00:22,795
I don't need anybody.

896
01:00:22,829 --> 01:00:26,065
Gee. I wonder if all
the other lone dinosaurs

897
01:00:26,098 --> 01:00:27,967
talk out loud
to themselves like this?

898
01:00:29,736 --> 01:00:32,104
They must.
It would be too quiet.

Littlefoot!
Hey, Littlefoot.

902
01:02:47,473 --> 01:02:48,474
Where'd you go?

903
01:02:50,042 --> 01:02:52,979
Me no find him anywhere.

904
01:02:53,012 --> 01:02:55,247
No see ussie.
Dinah Dana.

905
01:02:55,281 --> 01:02:56,615
BOTH: Huh-uh!

906
01:02:56,648 --> 01:02:59,385
What was it he said,
right before he left?

907
01:02:59,418 --> 01:03:02,254
Littlefoot say
he gonna fix it.

908
01:03:02,288 --> 01:03:06,058
Fix what?
Uh, the bad luck,
I guess.

909
01:03:06,092 --> 01:03:08,594
Yes, but how?
Well...

910
01:03:08,627 --> 01:03:10,562
He said we caused
it when we broke

911
01:03:10,596 --> 01:03:13,232
the Sharptooth's tooth
off Saurus Rock.

912
01:03:13,265 --> 01:03:15,868
(GASPS)
Uh-oh.

913
01:03:15,902 --> 01:03:18,104
You kids better wait
with Grandpa Threehorn.

914
01:03:18,137 --> 01:03:19,906
We've got something
we need to do.

915
01:03:28,347 --> 01:03:30,049
Let's see.

916
01:03:30,082 --> 01:03:32,518
Now where...
There he is!

917
01:03:32,551 --> 01:03:34,120
Right where he landed.

918
01:03:38,157 --> 01:03:40,092
Just one tooth...

919
01:03:40,927 --> 01:03:42,461
(GASPS)

920
01:03:42,494 --> 01:03:45,197
That's all I need. (GROANS)

921
01:03:45,231 --> 01:03:47,199
If I can get it back
on Saurus Rock,

922
01:03:47,233 --> 01:03:49,335
all the bad luck will end.

923
01:03:51,170 --> 01:03:52,404
Whoa!

924
01:03:56,242 --> 01:03:58,510
(PANTING)
And Doc can stay.

925
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:04,550
So that's it?
You're leaving?

926
01:04:04,583 --> 01:04:08,955
You don't have to go.
Nobody really blames you
for these...

927
01:04:08,988 --> 01:04:10,990
Misfortunes.

928
01:04:11,023 --> 01:04:14,260
Such things are just part
of the circle of life.

929
01:04:14,293 --> 01:04:17,029
I'd be moving on,
anyway.

930
01:04:17,063 --> 01:04:19,098
Now is as good a time
as any.

931
01:04:20,066 --> 01:04:21,400
No need to cause trouble.

932
01:04:23,569 --> 01:04:28,340
Littlefoot will miss you.
He's a good kid.

933
01:04:28,374 --> 01:04:32,378
Well. Better get started
while the Bright
Circle's high.

934
01:04:32,411 --> 01:04:37,316
You're always welcome
if you happen to be
heading this way again.

935
01:04:37,349 --> 01:04:39,218
Much obliged.

936
01:04:44,556 --> 01:04:47,359
KIDS:
Grandpa Longneck!
Grandpa Longneck!

937
01:04:47,393 --> 01:04:50,262

Where's Littlefoot?

(SNIFFING)

942
01:05:17,389 --> 01:05:19,258
Sure smells dead.

943
01:05:21,127 --> 01:05:23,729
Come on. You can do this.

944
01:05:23,762 --> 01:05:28,334
What's the big deal?
It's just a big,
dead Sharptooth.

945
01:05:28,367 --> 01:05:31,170
Might as well be
a pile of dirt.

946
01:05:31,203 --> 01:05:34,173
A big, smelly
pile of dirt.

947
01:05:34,206 --> 01:05:37,109
With...
Big, sharp teeth inside.

948
01:05:38,477 --> 01:05:39,678
Hmm...

949
01:05:39,711 --> 01:05:43,282
I'm gonna need a stick
or something to get
his mouth open.

950
01:05:50,089 --> 01:05:51,323
(SNARLS)

951
01:05:53,459 --> 01:05:55,161
(GROANING) Oh...

952
01:06:02,701 --> 01:06:05,637
Now which way?

953
01:06:05,671 --> 01:06:08,607
(PANTING)
You mean you don't know
the way to Saurus Rock?

954
01:06:11,210 --> 01:06:15,314
GRANDPA:
To tell you the truth,
I've never gone there.

955
01:06:15,347 --> 01:06:17,716
But you knew so much
about it.

956
01:06:17,749 --> 01:06:20,419
What it looked like,
and how it got there
and everything.

957
01:06:20,452 --> 01:06:22,721
You did, you did.

958
01:06:22,754 --> 01:06:24,356
Yep, yep, yep.

959
01:06:27,459 --> 01:06:31,130
Oh, well...
Those were stories
my grandpa told me

960
01:06:31,163 --> 01:06:33,332
when I was a youngster.

961
01:06:33,365 --> 01:06:35,134
(PANTING) Whew!
Oh...

962
01:06:35,167 --> 01:06:38,470
And right now I wish
I'd never told them
to you kids.

Ew...

965
01:06:48,747 --> 01:06:51,550
I better just pick one
and get out of here.

966
01:06:51,583 --> 01:06:53,685
I don't know how long
that stick will hold.

967
01:06:56,222 --> 01:06:57,756
That looks
like a good one.

It's stuck in there
pretty tight.

(GRUNTING CONTINUES)

972
01:07:10,202 --> 01:07:11,570
I can do this.

Whew!

974
01:07:14,740 --> 01:07:16,675
Good thing there's
a breeze in here.

975
01:07:18,544 --> 01:07:20,479
Wait a second.

976
01:07:20,512 --> 01:07:23,615
I'm inside a dead Sharptooth.

977
01:07:23,649 --> 01:07:25,684
Why would there be
a breeze?

978
01:07:25,717 --> 01:07:28,820
Unless it's... Breathing.

979
01:07:28,854 --> 01:07:32,224
But if it's breathing,
then that means...

980
01:07:32,258 --> 01:07:35,161

You came for me.

01:08:51,537 --> 01:08:54,473
Don't we always?
You sure do.

The time of bad luck's
almost over.

It's just time
I was going, kid.

1018
01:10:44,450 --> 01:10:47,353
Yeah, but...
This herd life's
not for me.

You never know

need... A hero.

1026

You already got
a hero, kid.

Oh, Littlefoot, I told you.

1031
01:12:20,446 --> 01:12:23,849
That was all just
a bedtime story.
There's no...

1032
01:12:23,882 --> 01:12:27,419
I know, I know.
There's no such thing
as bad luck.

1033
01:12:27,453 --> 01:12:29,655
But there's no harm
in making sure.

1034
01:12:29,688 --> 01:12:31,790
I suppose not.

1035
01:12:33,659 --> 01:12:35,393
Let's go home.

1036
01:12:44,670 --> 01:12:47,138
Grandpa?
Yes, Littlefoot?

1037
01:12:48,106 --> 01:12:49,975

no place to hide.

1040
01:13:14,700 --> 01:13:17,168
All seemed lost
for the leaf-eaters.

1041
01:13:17,202 --> 01:13:20,205
That terrible Sharptooth
had them cornered.

1042
01:13:20,238 --> 01:13:22,874
His massive teeth
dripped blood

1043
01:13:22,908 --> 01:13:25,143
as he threw his head back
and roared.

(ROARING)

1045
01:13:28,179 --> 01:13:31,717
But then...
Just when there seemed
to be no escape...

1046
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:34,252
Suddenly...
Oh, let me tell this part.

1047
01:13:34,285 --> 01:13:36,688
Oh, okay.

1048
01:13:36,722 --> 01:13:39,124
Just when there seemed
to be no escape,

1049
01:13:39,157 --> 01:13:42,561
suddenly the leaf-eaters
looked on the horizon.

1050
01:13:42,594 --> 01:13:46,898
LITTLEFOOT:
And there stood...
The Great Dinosaur!

1051
01:13:51,937 --> 01:13:54,540
He stared
at the Sharptooth.
ALL: Whoa!

1052
01:13:55,874 --> 01:13:57,175
Then he whipped
his tail forward...

1053
01:13:57,208 --> 01:14:00,879
NARRATOR: And so,
another myth was born.

1054
01:14:00,912 --> 01:14:03,682
It would change
with each re-telling.

1055
01:14:03,715 --> 01:14:05,751
And even now...

1056
01:14:05,784 --> 01:14:07,819
Who knows where this one
will end?
