1
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:56,617
Many eons ago,
when the Earth was young,

2
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:00,388
millions of years
before the first humans,

3
00:02:00,421 --> 00:02:02,590
was the age
of the great lizards…

4
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:07,428
The dinosaurs.

5
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:10,631
These massive creatures
roamed the earth

6
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:13,367
for thousands of centuries.

7
00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:21,209
Some ate plants…

8
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:28,382
While others,
the dreaded Sharpteeth,

9
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:30,651
hunted their fellow dinosaurs.

10
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:38,626
But the plant-eaters found
refuge from their predators

11
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:41,662
in one special place…

12
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:44,298
The Great Valley.

13
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:48,669
A place where friends

14
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:50,971
Littlefoot, the long neck,

15
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,307
Cera, the three-horn,

16
00:02:57,278 --> 00:02:59,179
Ducky, the swimmer,

17
00:03:03,484 --> 00:03:05,953
Petrie, the flyer,

18
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:08,489
and Spike, the spike-tail,

19
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:12,893
could grow and play together

20
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:16,397
under the watchful eye
of their loving families.

21
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:05,946
Littlefoot!
Littlefoot!

22
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:08,382
It's time to come home.

23
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:12,620
That's my grandpa. Gotta go!
I'll see you guys later.

24
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:15,723
See ya, Littlefoot!
Bye! See ya!

25
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,591
Goodbye!

26
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:35,409
Hiya, Grandpa.

27
00:04:35,443 --> 00:04:38,446
Hello, Littlefoot.
Come eat your breakfast.

28
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,349
Okay! I'm hungry!

29
00:04:41,382 --> 00:04:46,086
Of course, though the
Great Valley was a wondrous place,

30
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,556
it still had its dangers.

31
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:00,468
Hmm. I like this place.

32
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:04,605
Yes, I like this place a lot!

33
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:05,806
Don't you, Strut?

34
00:05:09,377 --> 00:05:11,345
Strut! Get up here!

35
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:13,581
What? I'm eating.

36
00:05:13,614 --> 00:05:16,484
Spit that stuff out!
Go on! Spit it out!

37
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:18,552
But, Ozzy, I'm hungry!

38
00:05:18,586 --> 00:05:21,589
Spit it out, you grass-guzzler!

39
00:05:21,622 --> 00:05:25,526
No brother of mine is
going to eat vegetation,

40
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:27,695
not while I'm around.

41
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:30,631
Then what are we
going to eat, Ozzy?

42
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:33,734
Eggs, dear brother… Eggs!

43
00:05:35,436 --> 00:05:37,471
The Valley is full of them.

44
00:05:37,505 --> 00:05:42,476
Nice, plump, juicy eggs.

45
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:51,485
Here you are, Littlefoot.

46
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:54,121
The last tree star's for you.

47
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,426
Great trick, Grandpa.

48
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:00,728
It's not a trick, Littlefoot.

49
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:02,763
All long necks can do it.

50
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:06,366
Great! Let me try, Grandpa.

51
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:25,886
Careful, Littlefoot.

52
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:40,834
Guess I'm too little,
huh, Grandpa?

53
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:46,474
You're still very young.

54
00:06:46,507 --> 00:06:48,909
But you'll get the
hang of it someday.

55
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:52,145
Aw, I hate being little.

56
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:56,149
Don't worry, you'll be
grown-up soon enough.

57
00:06:56,183 --> 00:06:57,718
Hey, Littlefoot!

58
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,754
Come on!

59
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:04,492
Grandpa, can I go play?
Have fun!

60
00:07:04,892 --> 00:07:06,426
Thanks.

61
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:12,800
The Valley is a
wonderful place to grow up.

62
00:07:21,842 --> 00:07:24,578
Let's play!
Let's play!

63
00:07:24,612 --> 00:07:26,580
Not it!
Not it!

64
00:07:26,614 --> 00:07:27,815
Well, I'm not it!

65
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:29,750
Me no it, either!

66
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,218
Spike's it!

67
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:40,460
Smell something, Ozzy?

68
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:45,733
Yes. Breakfast.

69
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:49,469
Follow me.

70
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:55,709
Oh, yes.

71
00:07:55,743 --> 00:07:58,846
Slurp! Ow!

72
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:10,290
Ozzy? Did you get a…

73
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,826
Egg… Oh…

74
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:20,000
Hey, you kids!

75
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:22,770
Stop rolling those
rocks down the hill.

76
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:25,238
Huh?

77
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:28,742
My nest is in there!

78
00:08:28,776 --> 00:08:29,943
Sorry.

79
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:36,249
Aw, it wasn't much fun, anyway.

80
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:39,519
Yep, yep, yep.
No fun at all.

81
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:43,891
Boring.

82
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:46,259
What do you want to do now?

83
00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:47,327
Huh.

84
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,597
I know! I know!

85
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:52,332
We could go to
the Sheltering Grass,

86
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,769
and play Sharptooth Attack.

87
00:09:00,641 --> 00:09:02,309
No way!

88
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:04,678
Not if I have to be
the Sharptooth again.

89
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:07,314
Hey!

90
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:09,549
How about Spike be Sharptooth?

91
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:13,587
Oh, yes, yes, Spike.

92
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:16,323
Okay, Spike? Huh?

93
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:17,891
Please?

94
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:20,794
Mm-hmm.

95
00:09:20,828 --> 00:09:22,663
See? He no mind.

96
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:24,665
Hurrah!

97
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:26,366
All right! Let's go!

98
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,336
Yep, yep, yep. We are going
to the Sheltering Grass.

99
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:32,372
Whee!

100
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,708
Wait, you guys!

101
00:09:34,742 --> 00:09:36,043
Huh?

102
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:39,112
The Sheltering Grass is on the
other side of the Sinking Sand.

103
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,781
So?

104
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:42,482
Well…

105
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:46,353
My grandparents don't want me going
across the Sinking Sand without them.

106
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:48,956
That right. Sinking
Sand dangerous.

107
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:51,358
Glug, glug, glug…

108
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:53,861
Yes, it is.

109
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:56,764
It is.

110
00:09:56,797 --> 00:09:58,932
Aw! You're just
a bunch of eggs.

111
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,870
Wa-ha! Oh!

112
00:10:02,903 --> 00:10:05,939
I could cross the Sinking
Sands with my eyes closed!

113
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,742
With her eyes closed!

114
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:12,813
And not looking
where she is going!

115
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:18,318
Hey! That sound fun.
Petrie try it.

116
00:10:26,694 --> 00:10:29,897
Aah! Ooh…

117
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:33,033
Hey! Are you scaredy-eggs
coming or not?

118
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:44,144
Littlefoot, you coming?

119
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:48,816
Oh, well… Um…

120
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:50,684
Yeah, I'm coming!

121
00:10:50,718 --> 00:10:52,085
Hee!

122
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:54,688
Let's go!

123
00:10:59,927 --> 00:11:01,661
The Sinking Sand.

124
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,069
How are we gonna get across?

125
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:10,804
Hmm.

126
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:15,909
Ew. I cannot
swim in this.

127
00:11:15,943 --> 00:11:18,111
Oh, no, no, no.

128
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:20,914
Petrie fly across.

129
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:31,191
Petrie, we no have wings!
No, no, no, we cannot fly.

130
00:11:31,224 --> 00:11:32,459
Ohh…

131
00:11:34,094 --> 00:11:36,196
Poor Petrie.

132
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:39,199
My dad just jumps
from rock to rock.

133
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:42,736
Yeah, but your dad's
got longer legs than us.

134
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:46,473
Big deal! I could
do it, too. Watch!

135
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,145
Hee!

136
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,151
Whew! See? Whoa!

137
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,888
Help!
Cera!

138
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:02,155
Hang on!

139
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:05,092
Wait for Petrie!

140
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,761
Help!

141
00:12:07,795 --> 00:12:11,064
I got you, Cera!
Yes, I do!

142
00:12:11,498 --> 00:12:13,033
Hang on!

143
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:17,137
Littlefoot!

144
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:21,975
That it, Littlefoot. Pull! Pull!

145
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:25,846
Oh my! Oh no!
No! What can I do?

146
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:28,215
I go for help!
What? No!

147
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,117
We not supposed to be here!

148
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,252
Hurray, Spike!

149
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:35,122
Huh? That's it,
Spike, you help!

150
00:12:35,155 --> 00:12:38,792
Wait! I help!
I help! I pull too!

151
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:51,204
Ahh!

152
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:55,542
Help!

153
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,956
Cera?

154
00:13:10,323 --> 00:13:11,791
Petrie!

155
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:14,862
Ducky! Spike!

156
00:13:14,895 --> 00:13:16,196
Littlefoot!

157
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:22,602
Don't give up!

158
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,171
We can make it…

159
00:13:25,172 --> 00:13:26,806
Littlefoot!

160
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,527
Whew. We made it!

161
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:55,168
Uh-oh.

162
00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:12,252
Now is the time
for all good little eggs,

163
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:16,089
to be safely tucked
into their nests.

164
00:14:16,123 --> 00:14:18,125
I wouldn't mind being tucked in,

165
00:14:18,158 --> 00:14:20,994
I'm egg-hausted!

166
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:24,197
Would you stop complaining?

167
00:14:24,231 --> 00:14:28,235
But Ozzy, I'm tired.
And I'm hungry.

168
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:32,639
Couldn't I have just a ity-bity
little green bedtime snack?

169
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:37,577
No! Can't you see I'm trying to
wean you away from that stuff?

170
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:42,649
From now on, you gotta think, feel
and breathe only one food group.

171
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:43,984
Eggs.

172
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:40,133
Tonight, we feast!

173
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:51,178
Shh!

174
00:16:55,215 --> 00:16:59,352
Littlefoot, your grandma and I
just don't want to lose you.

175
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:03,256
You are all we have.

176
00:17:04,324 --> 00:17:06,726
It's so hard to be little.

177
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:09,529
You'll grow up
faster than you think.

178
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:11,098
Be patient.

179
00:17:11,131 --> 00:17:13,733
Enjoy being young
while it lasts.

180
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:16,536
And stay close to the herd.

181
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:18,471
Aw, gee…

182
00:17:18,505 --> 00:17:21,441
We feel safe here in the Valley.

183
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:23,476
The Great Wall protects us

184
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:28,081
from Sharpteeth and other dangers
of the Mysterious Beyond.

185
00:17:28,115 --> 00:17:31,484
But there are dangers in the
Valley as well, Littlefoot.

186
00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:34,754
You must always be careful.

187
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:36,256
But my friends…

188
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:37,824
Hush now.

189
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:40,293
It is time for sleep.

190
00:17:40,327 --> 00:17:43,763
The Bright Circle has
already gone from the sky.

191
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:46,233
But I'm not sleepy.

192
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:48,335
Go along, Littlefoot.

193
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:50,337
But I'm not…

194
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:54,207
I'm not…

195
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:58,345
I'm thirsty.

196
00:17:58,378 --> 00:18:00,213
Yes, Littlefoot.

197
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,454
Good night.

198
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:10,423
Good night, Grandpa.
Good night, Grandma.

199
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:14,527
Good night, my little one.

200
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,816
Psst! Littlefoot!

201
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:38,618
Littlefoot, wake up!

202
00:18:38,651 --> 00:18:42,355
Huh? Cera?
Where are you?

203
00:18:42,389 --> 00:18:43,523
Here!

204
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:46,526
Where?
Here!

205
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:50,497
What are you doing here?

206
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:53,200
Shhh! Quiet!

207
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:54,634
What's the matter?

208
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:56,469
I can't sleep.

209
00:18:56,503 --> 00:18:59,906
It's important.
We've got to talk!

210
00:19:01,408 --> 00:19:02,642
Now?

211
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:05,212
Shhh! Yes, now!

212
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:08,648
Scared of the dark?

213
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:10,383
I'm not scared!

214
00:19:10,417 --> 00:19:12,585
Then come on!
Let's get the others!

215
00:19:18,425 --> 00:19:21,661
Yep, yep, yep!
We are all here!

216
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:24,531
Yes, we are.

217
00:19:24,564 --> 00:19:25,665
But what we here for?

218
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:27,867
Yes, is there a problem?

219
00:19:28,435 --> 00:19:29,869
Grown-ups!

220
00:19:32,272 --> 00:19:35,375
I suppose you all got
the same lecture I did?

221
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:38,311
Mm-hmm.

222
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:41,281
Me too young to wander far.

223
00:19:41,314 --> 00:19:44,551
We are not grown-ups
and should remember it.

224
00:19:44,584 --> 00:19:48,621
There are many dangers.
I must always be careful.

225
00:19:48,655 --> 00:19:53,460
Don't hang around with long necks,
beak faces and spike-tails.

226
00:19:56,396 --> 00:19:59,966
Well, it was mostly
the same lecture.

227
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:02,635
Grandpa and Grandma were mainly
worried that I'd get hurt.

228
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:05,238
That's the problem!

229
00:20:05,272 --> 00:20:07,940
They don't think we can
take care of ourselves.

230
00:20:07,974 --> 00:20:13,280
We've got to do something so the grown-ups
will stop treating us like hatchlings.

231
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:15,648
Cera right!

232
00:20:15,682 --> 00:20:19,386
I agree. I do! I do!

233
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:21,621
So what are we going to do?

234
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:24,357
Well…

235
00:20:25,992 --> 00:20:28,227
We could run away from home!

236
00:20:32,499 --> 00:20:33,666
Where we run?

237
00:20:36,035 --> 00:20:37,637
We could just stay here!

238
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:44,611
That's silly. Anybody
could find us here.

239
00:20:44,644 --> 00:20:48,648
Nuh-uh. See these rocks?
This could be our hideout!

240
00:20:48,681 --> 00:20:50,550
And we're up real high.

241
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,485
Nobody could sneak up on us.

242
00:20:53,052 --> 00:20:54,754
Cera right. Look.

243
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:58,758
You can see everything from
up here. You can, you can.

244
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:02,729
Hey Ducky, there's your nest.
But who's that walking away?

245
00:21:05,565 --> 00:21:08,635
Hey!
They're stealing an egg!

246
00:21:08,668 --> 00:21:12,038
They are egg-napping
part of our family!

247
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:14,774
Quick, let's tell the grown-ups!

248
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:16,343
No, wait!

249
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:21,681
If we catch 'em ourselves, it'll show
everyone that we're not babies anymore!

250
00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:24,684
Oh, yes! Yes, yes, yes!

251
00:21:24,717 --> 00:21:25,885
I don't know…

252
00:21:25,918 --> 00:21:29,722
Look, scaredy, there's five
of us and only two of them!

253
00:21:29,756 --> 00:21:33,059
What could go wrong? Hmm?

254
00:21:33,092 --> 00:21:34,727
Well…

255
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:36,529
Please?

256
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,665
Okay.

257
00:21:38,698 --> 00:21:41,000
Let's go get 'em!

258
00:21:47,707 --> 00:21:49,676
Now remember,
I get the first bite.

259
00:21:49,709 --> 00:21:52,078
After all, this was my idea.

260
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,814
Drop that egg!

261
00:21:54,847 --> 00:21:58,585
Huh? Oh, don't!

262
00:21:59,452 --> 00:22:02,389
Uh-oh. We've been spotted.

263
00:22:02,422 --> 00:22:04,757
I told you not to be so obvious.

264
00:22:07,126 --> 00:22:09,496
Ozzy, wait for me!

265
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:13,566
Bring back my
brother! Um, or sister!

266
00:22:18,405 --> 00:22:21,040
They're headed for
the Mysterious Beyond.

267
00:22:24,611 --> 00:22:27,580
Maybe we should
get help after all.

268
00:22:27,614 --> 00:22:30,349
It's too late now.
They'll get away.

269
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:34,353
This was your idea.
Are you coming or not?

270
00:22:57,877 --> 00:22:59,812
How big are they?

271
00:23:03,182 --> 00:23:06,085
Oh, they're big, very big!

272
00:23:09,188 --> 00:23:10,557
Huh?

273
00:23:14,661 --> 00:23:16,596
Whew!

274
00:23:16,629 --> 00:23:19,532
Uh… You first.
Aah!

275
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:36,849
It not so far!
You can do it!

276
00:23:42,722 --> 00:23:44,657
Come on, Spike, hurry!

277
00:23:45,692 --> 00:23:46,959
Ur-rumph!

278
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,507
Ducky!

279
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:03,810
Don't worry, I got her.

280
00:24:03,843 --> 00:24:05,912
You mean, I got you.

281
00:24:17,824 --> 00:24:19,959
I hope this egg is worth it.

282
00:24:19,992 --> 00:24:21,528
Worth it?

283
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:24,997
All eggs are worth
it, bark breath!

284
00:24:26,766 --> 00:24:28,601
Here! C'mon!

285
00:24:32,605 --> 00:24:34,473
Who are those guys?

286
00:24:36,275 --> 00:24:38,244
- Come on.
- Let's go.

287
00:24:38,277 --> 00:24:39,712
Don't stop.

288
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:43,850
Oh no!
Keep going!

289
00:24:47,854 --> 00:24:52,725
Acting grown-up
is hard. It is. It is.

290
00:25:02,635 --> 00:25:05,705
Haha! We made it, Strut!

291
00:25:05,738 --> 00:25:09,542
Those grass-nippers will never
be able to follow us now!

292
00:25:09,576 --> 00:25:11,878
It won't be long, egg.

293
00:25:11,911 --> 00:25:16,683
Soon you'll be nestled
in the pit of my stomach!

294
00:25:16,716 --> 00:25:17,984
Ha ha ha!

295
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,756
Oz, when's it your
turn to hold the egg?

296
00:25:26,593 --> 00:25:27,994
Where they go?

297
00:25:28,828 --> 00:25:32,298
I don't see anybody!

298
00:25:32,331 --> 00:25:34,967
They are disappeared!
They are!

299
00:25:38,004 --> 00:25:40,607
They must have gone
in there! Come on!

300
00:25:57,957 --> 00:26:01,694
Cera, what's taking you?

301
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:06,032
Nothing. I just don't feel like going
in there right now, that's all.

302
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:07,600
Cera?

303
00:26:07,634 --> 00:26:09,969
Hmph!

304
00:26:10,002 --> 00:26:12,705
All right then, we're
going without you.

305
00:26:19,378 --> 00:26:21,614
Shh! This way.

306
00:26:26,786 --> 00:26:28,688
It sure is dark in here.

307
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:36,829
Okay, Strut. Now it's my
turn to hold the egg.

308
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:43,636
Oh no… Where…
Just a moment ago…

309
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:46,105
I've looked… Ah!

310
00:27:09,896 --> 00:27:15,334
Whatever you do, Strut! Ouch!
Ooh! Don't lose that egg!

311
00:27:47,033 --> 00:27:48,801
Help!

312
00:27:57,744 --> 00:28:00,012
Are you guys all right?

313
00:28:00,046 --> 00:28:04,016
Petrie not okay.
Me hurt everywhere.

314
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:11,057
Whoa! Good, Cera.

315
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,696
Ooh… I think I bent my horn.

316
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:21,467
Where is Spike? Oh…

317
00:28:23,803 --> 00:28:25,838
Yeah! Hooray!

318
00:28:33,012 --> 00:28:35,848
Spike! Stop it!

319
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:39,085
I'm okay, I am!

320
00:28:52,531 --> 00:28:54,233
This place spooky.

321
00:28:54,266 --> 00:28:56,502
Where are we?

322
00:28:56,535 --> 00:29:00,106
I think we're in
the Mysterious Beyond.

323
00:29:00,139 --> 00:29:02,942
The Mysterious Beyond?

324
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:10,182
Well, I'm not afraid of
any ol' Mysterious Beyond.

325
00:29:15,888 --> 00:29:19,992
There is nothing to be afraid
of as long as we are together.

326
00:29:20,026 --> 00:29:22,862
Right? Right?

327
00:29:32,905 --> 00:29:34,773
I wanna go home!

328
00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:37,243
Petrie go home too!

329
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:39,545
But what about the egg?

330
00:29:39,578 --> 00:29:43,482
We cannot leave
it here. All alone.

331
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:46,785
I'm… I'm afraid
it got smushed.

332
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,557
Bye-bye, baby sister.

333
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,525
Or baby brother.

334
00:29:56,328 --> 00:30:01,567
Don't cry, Ducky. It's… It's all
part of the Great Circle of Life.

335
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,004
Besides, there's a whole
nestful of eggs at home.

336
00:30:06,205 --> 00:30:09,308
Yes, but this one was special.

337
00:30:09,341 --> 00:30:12,879
It was going to be
my favorite favorite.

338
00:30:12,912 --> 00:30:16,615
All blue and orange
and speckled.

339
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:21,120
There was not another egg
like it in the whole world.

340
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:24,323
Except this one.

341
00:30:24,356 --> 00:30:26,525
- Ducky! It's safe!
- It's here!

342
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:28,060
The egg!

343
00:30:29,128 --> 00:30:31,197
It is not smushed!

344
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:34,200
Oh, hello, baby
brother or sister!

345
00:30:34,233 --> 00:30:37,970
Hey! You growed.

346
00:30:38,004 --> 00:30:42,008
This is going to be a very
big baby brother or sister.

347
00:30:47,113 --> 00:30:49,615
C'mon, we better get
it back to the nest.

348
00:30:49,648 --> 00:30:51,984
But how we do that?
Egg is big!

349
00:30:52,018 --> 00:30:53,085
I know a way.

350
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:56,255
We'll build a carrying nest
outta leaves and stuff!

351
00:30:56,288 --> 00:30:58,991
Oh, yes! A carrying nest!

352
00:30:59,258 --> 00:31:01,127
Yes, yes, yes!

353
00:31:13,272 --> 00:31:15,141
Ahh! Oh! Ahh!

354
00:31:17,309 --> 00:31:19,211
Whoa!

355
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:21,580
Huh?

356
00:31:35,094 --> 00:31:38,130
- Home.
- Sweet home.

357
00:31:58,017 --> 00:32:01,287
I can't wait to tell everybody
how we saved the egg.

358
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,922
They no treat us
like babies anymore!

359
00:32:07,226 --> 00:32:09,228
Go on, Ducky, put it back.

360
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:11,363
It is back.
Look.

361
00:32:26,145 --> 00:32:29,315
So if Ducky's egg
was there all the time,

362
00:32:29,348 --> 00:32:31,050
whose egg is this?

363
00:32:31,083 --> 00:32:33,319
Maybe those bad guys
steal it from other nest.

364
00:32:33,352 --> 00:32:35,321
Yeah, but which one?

365
00:32:35,354 --> 00:32:38,390
We won't know until it hatches.

366
00:32:38,424 --> 00:32:42,094
Yes. Then we can take
it back to its family!

367
00:32:42,128 --> 00:32:45,131
But who's going to take care
of it until it hatches?

368
00:32:45,164 --> 00:32:46,765
We are, of course.

369
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,468
After all, we are not babies.

370
00:32:49,501 --> 00:32:53,172
I don't know. Maybe we
should tell our folks.

371
00:32:54,106 --> 00:32:55,241
No!

372
00:32:58,377 --> 00:33:00,746
If they find out where we were,

373
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:03,282
they'll put us
back in our nests.

374
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:06,118
We don't tell the
grown-ups anything! Right?

375
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,755
Right?

376
00:33:12,758 --> 00:33:14,126
Right.

377
00:33:37,283 --> 00:33:38,750
Littlefoot?

378
00:33:43,822 --> 00:33:46,092
Wake up, sleepyhead.

379
00:33:46,125 --> 00:33:49,261
The Bright Circle is already
rising into the sky.

380
00:33:56,568 --> 00:34:01,107
I feel like a
mountain fell on me.

381
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,241
It did.

382
00:34:02,274 --> 00:34:04,310
Is that you, Ozzy?

383
00:34:04,343 --> 00:34:05,511
Where are you?

384
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:07,813
You're standing on me.

385
00:34:07,846 --> 00:34:09,448
I'm wha… Oh!

386
00:34:13,185 --> 00:34:15,053
Did you save the egg?

387
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:18,424
The, uh, egg?

388
00:34:18,457 --> 00:34:21,827
Oh, you mean the egg?
Well, I don't…

389
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:25,331
I mean…
Those kids…

390
00:34:25,364 --> 00:34:31,170
Yeah, that's it! Those kids did it.
They stole our egg! The nerve!

391
00:34:31,203 --> 00:34:35,541
They did, did they?
Well, they'll pay.

392
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:37,309
And dearly.

393
00:34:50,356 --> 00:34:52,458
How long do we have to wait?

394
00:34:52,491 --> 00:34:54,293
Gee, I don't know.

395
00:34:54,326 --> 00:34:56,462
It could be a long time.

396
00:34:56,495 --> 00:34:59,231
My mama sit on eggs
to keep warm, make hatch.

397
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:04,136
Me sit on egg.

398
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:06,205
I wonder what it's going to be.

399
00:35:06,238 --> 00:35:07,606
A girl, I hope.

400
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:09,808
Maybe it flyer like me.

401
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:13,145
Or a swimmer like me!

402
00:35:13,179 --> 00:35:15,581
Hey! Why can't
we be its parents?

403
00:35:18,417 --> 00:35:23,322
Don't be silly, Littlefoot,
how can we be its parents?

404
00:35:23,355 --> 00:35:27,626
Well, we'll raise it.
Teach it stuff. It'll be fun.

405
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:29,495
Oh, yes, yes, yes!

406
00:35:29,528 --> 00:35:33,131
I will be a very
good mama. Mm-hmm.

407
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:36,568
We be good parents.

408
00:35:39,905 --> 00:35:42,574
Well, I think I'll
make the best parent.

409
00:35:42,608 --> 00:35:43,909
Why's that, Cera?

410
00:35:43,942 --> 00:35:47,346
Because I'll let her do
anything she wants!

411
00:35:47,379 --> 00:35:50,282
That sound good to me.

412
00:35:50,316 --> 00:35:52,918
Our baby will
never hear, "No!"

413
00:35:52,951 --> 00:35:55,854
Oh, no, no, no, no!

414
00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:57,523
So, we're gonna do it?

415
00:35:57,556 --> 00:35:59,157
Yes!

416
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,168
Look!

417
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:14,240
It hatching!

418
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:23,649
It's, it's a…

419
00:36:24,483 --> 00:36:26,318
Sharptooth!

420
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,590
- Sharptooth!
- Run!

421
00:36:31,623 --> 00:36:33,392
Sharptooth?

422
00:36:52,678 --> 00:36:54,280
Ahh!

423
00:37:03,322 --> 00:37:05,557
He doesn't look so dangerous.

424
00:37:07,759 --> 00:37:10,462
It's all right,
I won't hurt you.

425
00:37:13,632 --> 00:37:16,502
Friendly, aren't you?

426
00:37:20,672 --> 00:37:24,276
Hey, I bet you think
I'm your mama.

427
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:25,611
Er… Papa!

428
00:37:27,779 --> 00:37:29,681
Well, I'm not really,

429
00:37:29,715 --> 00:37:32,751
but don't worry, I'm going
to take good care of you!

430
00:37:32,784 --> 00:37:36,021
My friends will too, once
they see how nice you are.

431
00:37:36,054 --> 00:37:38,023
Come on.
I'll show you around.

432
00:37:45,397 --> 00:37:48,767
Well, I guess I'd better
teach you to walk first.

433
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,669
First you lift one foot,

434
00:37:50,702 --> 00:37:52,671
then you put it down
in front of you,

435
00:37:52,704 --> 00:37:55,407
then you lift the other!
Now you try.

436
00:37:59,411 --> 00:38:01,813
Slow down!
You'll hurt yourself!

437
00:38:05,384 --> 00:38:06,785
Are you okay?

438
00:38:09,588 --> 00:38:12,624
You're going to
have to be more careful.

439
00:38:14,693 --> 00:38:18,364
It's okay, I'm not mad, um…

440
00:38:18,397 --> 00:38:20,766
Hey, you need a name.

441
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:29,074
I know!
I'll call you Chomper!

442
00:38:29,107 --> 00:38:32,744
I guess you're hungry, huh?

443
00:38:35,447 --> 00:38:40,419
Gee, I know what
Sharpteeth like, but…

444
00:38:40,452 --> 00:38:44,523
Well, maybe I can teach you
to eat green food like me!

445
00:38:44,556 --> 00:38:46,758
After all, I'm your papa now!

446
00:38:48,627 --> 00:38:50,028
Here.

447
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:54,533
These leaves are really tasty.
Try some.

448
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:04,510
Hmm. This is gonna be
harder than I thought.

449
00:39:04,543 --> 00:39:06,712
Chomper, you stay here, okay?

450
00:39:06,745 --> 00:39:08,514
Uh-huh.

451
00:39:08,547 --> 00:39:11,550
You won't go anywhere?
Uh-uh.

452
00:39:11,583 --> 00:39:13,652
Good. I'll be right back.

453
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:16,588
After I get some advice
from my grandparents.

454
00:39:16,622 --> 00:39:19,491
If Cera ever finds out,
she'll kill me.

455
00:39:39,177 --> 00:39:42,147
Um… Grandma, Grandpa,

456
00:39:45,584 --> 00:39:46,885
can I talk to you?

457
00:39:46,918 --> 00:39:49,688
Of course,
Littlefoot, what is it?

458
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:53,625
Well, um… I
want to know about babies.

459
00:39:57,629 --> 00:40:01,833
Littlefoot! You're too
young to worry about babies.

460
00:40:02,801 --> 00:40:05,203
Well, it's…

461
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,906
But, Grandma, I'm curious.

462
00:40:07,939 --> 00:40:11,176
All right. What would
you like to know?

463
00:40:11,209 --> 00:40:14,746
Well, how do babies
get enough to eat?

464
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:17,683
The mother or father
feeds them, of course.

465
00:40:17,716 --> 00:40:20,218
But what if they won't eat
what you feed them?

466
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:23,455
You wouldn't always eat
what we fed you.

467
00:40:23,489 --> 00:40:25,657
I wouldn't?
That's right.

468
00:40:25,691 --> 00:40:28,827
But when you got hungry
enough, you always ate.

469
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:32,230
I did?
Uh-huh.

470
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:35,534
All babies eat when they're
hungry, Littlefoot.

471
00:40:35,567 --> 00:40:38,804
Now, anything else
you'd like to know?

472
00:40:38,837 --> 00:40:39,971
Um…

473
00:40:40,739 --> 00:40:42,808
No, that's good.

474
00:40:42,841 --> 00:40:44,876
Thanks! Bye!

475
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:46,878
Kids!

476
00:40:46,912 --> 00:40:49,681
They want to grow up so fast.

477
00:40:49,715 --> 00:40:51,917
Yes, and once they do,

478
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:54,219
they wish they were young again.

479
00:41:03,562 --> 00:41:05,964
I don't see Littlefoot anywhere.

480
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,670
Maybe Sharptooth eat him.

481
00:41:11,703 --> 00:41:14,506
Poor Littlefoot.

482
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:16,975
Poor, poor Littlefoot.

483
00:41:17,008 --> 00:41:18,977
Well, well.

484
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:23,515
If it isn't the plant-grazers
who spoiled our supper!

485
00:41:23,549 --> 00:41:25,717
It is the egg-stealers!

486
00:41:25,751 --> 00:41:27,953
What we do?

487
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:30,288
Run!

488
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:33,892
Where's my egg, you rotten
little sprout-crunchers?

489
00:41:42,701 --> 00:41:43,935
Chomper!

490
00:41:46,905 --> 00:41:50,008
Chomper! Chomper!

491
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:53,545
I told him to stay put.
Why did he run off?

492
00:41:53,579 --> 00:41:54,946
Chomper!

493
00:41:59,785 --> 00:42:02,921
Chomper! Get back here!
It's dangerous!

494
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:10,228
Chomper, please!
I don't wanna lose you!

495
00:42:17,335 --> 00:42:19,671
Phew! That's better!

496
00:42:24,309 --> 00:42:26,712
You shouldn't
worry me like that.

497
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,618
Aw! Oh, well.

498
00:42:36,321 --> 00:42:38,289
It's my friends!

499
00:42:38,323 --> 00:42:39,891
Help us!

500
00:42:42,928 --> 00:42:45,597
Chomper, stay put
and don't move!

501
00:42:47,766 --> 00:42:49,801
And I mean it!

502
00:42:49,835 --> 00:42:52,671
Hold on, guys!
I'm coming!

503
00:42:55,674 --> 00:42:57,342
Ahh?

504
00:42:57,375 --> 00:43:01,312
Now, what
did you do with my egg?

505
00:43:01,346 --> 00:43:04,616
Your egg? We didn't do
anything to it.

506
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:05,851
It hatched!

507
00:43:05,884 --> 00:43:07,686
It hatched?

508
00:43:07,719 --> 00:43:11,322
Before I could eat it,
my egg hatched?

509
00:43:11,356 --> 00:43:14,325
Calm down, Ozzy. It was just an egg.

510
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,395
It was not just an egg!

511
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:19,097
It was our dinner!

512
00:43:22,067 --> 00:43:25,036
I'm warning you,
you little leaf-lickers.

513
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:28,373
Stay out of my way, or I'll…

514
00:43:28,406 --> 00:43:30,676
Leave my friends alone!

515
00:43:30,709 --> 00:43:32,343
Huh?

516
00:43:32,377 --> 00:43:33,812
Littlefoot!

517
00:43:33,845 --> 00:43:35,781
We are saved!

518
00:43:35,814 --> 00:43:38,884
Just what I can't stand!

519
00:43:38,917 --> 00:43:40,986
A bossy weed whacker!

520
00:43:47,759 --> 00:43:49,695
Huh?

521
00:43:53,164 --> 00:43:55,133
Sharptooth!

522
00:43:55,166 --> 00:43:57,703
Sharptooth! Ahhh!

523
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:20,826
Chomper!

524
00:44:20,859 --> 00:44:22,994
Oh, Chomper, you saved us!

525
00:44:23,028 --> 00:44:25,764
Chomper? What's a Chomper?

526
00:44:25,797 --> 00:44:28,867
It is his name, silly!

527
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:31,837
See, you guys,
Chomper is a nice Sharptooth.

528
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:33,805
He would never hurt us.

529
00:44:37,042 --> 00:44:38,176
Thanks, Chomper.

530
00:44:38,209 --> 00:44:40,812
You are so nice, Chomper!

531
00:44:40,846 --> 00:44:42,948
Me like you, Chomper!

532
00:44:42,981 --> 00:44:45,884
Chomper, this is your Aunt Cera.

533
00:44:46,852 --> 00:44:49,721
Your uncles, Spike and Petrie.

534
00:44:49,755 --> 00:44:51,489
And your Aunt Ducky.

535
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:54,459
Hi, Chomper.
I think you are cute!

536
00:46:41,566 --> 00:46:43,935
Ahh! He bit me!

537
00:46:43,969 --> 00:46:45,937
Chomper bit me!

538
00:46:45,971 --> 00:46:47,572
He didn't mean it.

539
00:46:47,605 --> 00:46:50,175
You call this not meaning it?

540
00:46:50,208 --> 00:46:52,277
Chomper!

541
00:47:00,618 --> 00:47:03,889
A Sharptooth can
never be one of us.

542
00:47:03,922 --> 00:47:06,091
Never!
Don't say that!

543
00:47:06,124 --> 00:47:07,926
You know it's true!

544
00:47:07,959 --> 00:47:09,227
He has to go!

545
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:11,262
No! He stays!

546
00:47:11,997 --> 00:47:14,032
He goes!

547
00:47:14,065 --> 00:47:15,633
He stays!

548
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:18,036
- He goes!
- He stays!

549
00:47:18,069 --> 00:47:20,538
Chomper, you did not mean

550
00:47:20,571 --> 00:47:24,109
to bite Cera, did you, huh?

551
00:47:24,142 --> 00:47:26,011
Huh?
Huh?

552
00:47:26,044 --> 00:47:27,913
I do not think he knows.

553
00:47:30,916 --> 00:47:33,919
We can't keep him,
and that's final!

554
00:47:33,952 --> 00:47:37,222
But… But, Cera,
he's just a baby.

555
00:47:37,255 --> 00:47:39,090
He needs us.

556
00:47:39,124 --> 00:47:41,592
He needs me too much!

557
00:47:41,626 --> 00:47:42,994
No, Chomper,

558
00:47:43,028 --> 00:47:46,064
you cannot
eat Petrie. No!

559
00:47:46,364 --> 00:47:47,933
Huh?

560
00:47:47,966 --> 00:47:50,635
I said, "No,"

561
00:47:50,668 --> 00:47:53,204
just like my parents.

562
00:47:53,238 --> 00:47:56,241
Oh, no, no, no, no, no…

563
00:47:56,274 --> 00:47:57,976
Don't you see, Chomper?

564
00:47:58,009 --> 00:47:59,610
You can't be a Sharptooth!

565
00:47:59,644 --> 00:48:02,347
Sharpteeth aren't allowed
in this valley!

566
00:48:07,318 --> 00:48:10,021
Wait, Chomper! Don't go!

567
00:48:10,055 --> 00:48:11,389
Littlefoot?

568
00:48:11,422 --> 00:48:14,292
Um… Maybe before
you bring Chomper back,

569
00:48:14,325 --> 00:48:16,261
you should think about it.

570
00:48:16,294 --> 00:48:19,130
Chomper is different than us,

571
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:20,932
he is.

572
00:48:20,966 --> 00:48:22,700
I don't care if he's different!

573
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:26,404
We should at least follow him to
make sure he doesn't get hurt.

574
00:48:53,664 --> 00:48:56,634
Next time, we look
before we leap.

575
00:48:56,667 --> 00:48:59,404
You think the Sharptooth
finished those kids off, Ozzy?

576
00:48:59,437 --> 00:49:01,206
I hope so.

577
00:49:01,239 --> 00:49:04,642
Now let's get ourselves
an egg, and eat!

578
00:49:09,247 --> 00:49:11,316
Chomper?

579
00:49:11,349 --> 00:49:13,251
Where are you?

580
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:14,952
Chomper?

581
00:49:16,021 --> 00:49:17,722
I am tired.

582
00:49:17,755 --> 00:49:20,225
I am. I am.

583
00:49:22,493 --> 00:49:26,031
We can't stop, Ducky,
not until we find Chomper.

584
00:49:26,064 --> 00:49:29,467
Maybe we stop, Chomper find us.

585
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:33,104
Well, I really don't care
if we find him or not.

586
00:49:35,206 --> 00:49:37,442
No one's making you come, Cera.

587
00:49:44,115 --> 00:49:47,318
My tummy's making
its hungry noise.

588
00:49:47,352 --> 00:49:49,487
My tummy talk too.

589
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,356
It say, "Feed me."

590
00:49:53,758 --> 00:49:56,061
I'm hungry too!

591
00:49:56,094 --> 00:49:57,428
Let's go home!

592
00:49:57,462 --> 00:50:00,065
Cera!
Ducky! Petrie! Spike!

593
00:50:00,098 --> 00:50:01,366
Come quick!

594
00:50:01,399 --> 00:50:04,335
It's Chomper! He's on
the Smoking Mountain!

595
00:50:20,418 --> 00:50:25,456
He could fall into the Gurgling Pit!
He could!

596
00:50:25,490 --> 00:50:28,526
Come back, Chomper!
It's too dangerous!

597
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:37,402
Ah! Lunch is served!

598
00:50:44,142 --> 00:50:45,810
Chomper! Come back!

599
00:50:45,843 --> 00:50:47,178
Huh?

600
00:50:51,116 --> 00:50:52,783
We're coming, Chomper!

601
00:50:52,817 --> 00:50:54,819
Don't move, Chomper!

602
00:50:54,852 --> 00:50:57,122
It's those kids again, Ozzy!

603
00:50:57,155 --> 00:50:58,823
We're coming, Chomper!

604
00:50:58,856 --> 00:51:01,226
Don't worry, Chomper!

605
00:51:01,259 --> 00:51:04,562
If they scream any louder,
they're gonna give us away!

606
00:51:11,869 --> 00:51:13,404
Ahhh!

607
00:51:18,809 --> 00:51:21,312
Ow! Look out!
Watch that!

608
00:51:23,348 --> 00:51:24,882
Me first!

609
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:38,329
Those kids have ruined
our lunch for the last time.

610
00:51:53,511 --> 00:51:55,146
Chomper!

611
00:51:55,513 --> 00:51:58,183
Chomper!

612
00:51:58,216 --> 00:52:00,185
Where are you?

613
00:52:00,218 --> 00:52:02,119
Look!

614
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:09,327
I… I think we better look
for Chomper some place safer.

615
00:52:10,528 --> 00:52:13,598
Leaving? So soon?

616
00:52:13,631 --> 00:52:16,334
But you haven't had your baths.

617
00:52:16,367 --> 00:52:19,370
Me no need bath. Me take
one just yesterday!

618
00:52:19,404 --> 00:52:22,307
You smelly old egg-stealers
better watch it!

619
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:23,908
Because it just so happens,

620
00:52:23,941 --> 00:52:27,512
we're friends with
a very mean Sharptooth.

621
00:52:27,545 --> 00:52:29,914
Sharpteeth don't have friends!

622
00:52:29,947 --> 00:52:33,218
They do too!

623
00:52:33,251 --> 00:52:36,487
If a Sharptooth's
your friend, prove it!

624
00:52:36,521 --> 00:52:39,557
But Ozzy! We saw
the Sharptooth's shadow.

625
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:41,259
That's good enough for me.

626
00:52:41,292 --> 00:52:43,361
Boy, are you dumb!

627
00:52:43,394 --> 00:52:47,265
That scary shadow
wasn't a big Sharptooth.

628
00:52:47,298 --> 00:52:48,699
It was just a baby.

629
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:51,269
Cera!

630
00:52:51,302 --> 00:52:53,304
I mean… Oops!

631
00:52:57,508 --> 00:53:00,378
Time's up, little ones.

632
00:53:10,921 --> 00:53:13,924
- Chomper! Chomper, where are you?
- Come on!

633
00:53:14,725 --> 00:53:16,361
Hurry!

634
00:53:21,399 --> 00:53:23,200
Look out!

635
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,410
Ahh!

636
00:53:48,359 --> 00:53:50,495
Come on! This way!

637
00:53:55,032 --> 00:53:59,003
I've had it with you
little sap-suckers!

638
00:54:01,506 --> 00:54:03,474
Huh? Ahhh!

639
00:54:04,542 --> 00:54:07,678
- Chomper!
- Yay!

640
00:54:07,712 --> 00:54:09,447
Chomper, you back!
Chomper!

641
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:10,981
Oh, Chomper!

642
00:54:11,015 --> 00:54:13,584
Chomper, I'm so glad
you came back.

643
00:54:15,052 --> 00:54:18,656
That's it! No more
fooling around!

644
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:28,366
I hate being little.

645
00:54:28,399 --> 00:54:32,470
Don't worry.
You'll be grown up soon enough.

646
00:54:37,475 --> 00:54:39,276
Quick! Across the tree.

647
00:54:48,519 --> 00:54:49,654
Ahh!

648
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:02,433
Ducky, Spike! Come on!

649
00:55:03,067 --> 00:55:05,736
Spike, I am afraid!

650
00:55:13,844 --> 00:55:15,713
You can do it!
Hurry!

651
00:55:17,448 --> 00:55:19,617
I'm first!
I'm always first!

652
00:55:26,857 --> 00:55:28,559
Ahh!

653
00:55:28,593 --> 00:55:30,428
Ozzy, wait for me.

654
00:55:30,795 --> 00:55:32,830
Ahh!

655
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:37,402
If this were a game, I'd
never want to play it again!

656
00:55:42,072 --> 00:55:44,108
Look like we still "it"!

657
00:55:44,141 --> 00:55:45,610
Run!

658
00:56:03,794 --> 00:56:06,363
Sharpteeth?
In the Valley?

659
00:56:06,797 --> 00:56:09,099
We must warn the others.

660
00:56:25,783 --> 00:56:27,384
Ahh!

661
00:56:58,215 --> 00:57:01,852
Oh! It dangerous out there!

662
00:57:01,886 --> 00:57:04,855
I thought Sharpteeth
couldn't get into the Valley.

663
00:57:06,591 --> 00:57:08,526
How did they get in?

664
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:10,595
I think it's our fault.

665
00:57:10,628 --> 00:57:13,531
What do you mean?
What did we do?

666
00:57:13,564 --> 00:57:16,501
We caused the rockslide that
made a hole in the Great Wall.

667
00:57:16,534 --> 00:57:18,235
Oh! Yeah.

668
00:57:20,538 --> 00:57:21,506
Grandpa!

669
00:57:23,841 --> 00:57:26,711
I gotta do something!

670
00:57:26,744 --> 00:57:28,846
Littlefoot, he's a grown-up!

671
00:57:28,879 --> 00:57:31,248
He can handle
that old Sharptooth!

672
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:32,950
No! He needs me!

673
00:57:36,654 --> 00:57:39,456
Chomper, stay here!

674
00:58:44,254 --> 00:58:45,656
Chomper!

675
00:58:48,325 --> 00:58:49,894
Get ready to pull!

676
00:58:49,927 --> 00:58:51,295
Uh-huh.

677
00:58:51,328 --> 00:58:52,663
Now!

678
00:59:12,850 --> 00:59:14,652
Littlefoot, in here!

679
00:59:28,098 --> 00:59:30,334
You good shot, Ducky!

680
00:59:30,367 --> 00:59:32,937
Thank you, Petrie.

681
00:59:32,970 --> 00:59:35,973
Take that,
you mean old Sharptooth!

682
00:59:45,683 --> 00:59:47,017
I'm coming, guys!

683
01:00:03,734 --> 01:00:04,869
Ahh!

684
01:00:07,137 --> 01:00:08,673
Spike!

685
01:00:10,908 --> 01:00:12,743
Now, Spike, now!

686
01:00:36,701 --> 01:00:38,135
We did it, Spike!

687
01:00:38,168 --> 01:00:41,038
We flattened that
dumb old Sharptooth!

688
01:00:41,071 --> 01:00:42,773
Hah… Ahh!

689
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:44,909
Another one!

690
01:00:51,048 --> 01:00:52,883
Spike!

691
01:00:52,917 --> 01:00:55,652
Do not stand there,
Spike! Run!

692
01:01:00,758 --> 01:01:01,892
Ducky!

693
01:01:05,062 --> 01:01:07,765
You leave my
little brother alone!

694
01:01:21,111 --> 01:01:22,980
That was one of our young ones!

695
01:01:23,013 --> 01:01:24,949
Ducky!
This way, quick!

696
01:01:27,985 --> 01:01:29,686
Help!

697
01:01:32,957 --> 01:01:34,224
Ahhh!

698
01:01:35,893 --> 01:01:37,127
Me coming, Ducky!

699
01:01:43,834 --> 01:01:45,702
Help!

700
01:02:08,859 --> 01:02:10,194
Get away from our children!

701
01:02:12,963 --> 01:02:14,231
Run, Petrie!

702
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:26,176
Look at the grown-ups go!
Get him, Papa!

703
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:07,117
Those Sharpteeth won't dare
show their faces here again!

704
01:03:07,151 --> 01:03:10,154
But how did they get into the
Valley in the first place?

705
01:03:10,187 --> 01:03:11,288
Who knows?

706
01:03:11,321 --> 01:03:13,858
It's never happened before!

707
01:03:13,891 --> 01:03:15,025
It's a mystery!

708
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:21,165
Kids? Do you know how
the Sharpteeth got in?

709
01:03:26,070 --> 01:03:29,139
Not really.
Oh, no, no…

710
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:31,508
Littlefoot?

711
01:03:31,541 --> 01:03:33,143
I…

712
01:03:35,112 --> 01:03:36,914
Cera?

713
01:03:36,947 --> 01:03:40,017
Well, um… See…

714
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:46,957
After we chased those egg-nappers
into the Mysterious Beyond…

715
01:03:46,991 --> 01:03:50,027
Mysterious Beyond?
Egg-nappers?

716
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:52,262
Some rocks fell, and that
made a big hole, and…

717
01:03:52,296 --> 01:03:55,199
So that's how the
Sharpteeth came through!

718
01:03:55,232 --> 01:03:57,267
We must close
the opening at once!

719
01:03:58,335 --> 01:04:00,070
I want to help!

720
01:04:00,104 --> 01:04:02,606
No, Littlefoot!
It's too dangerous!

721
01:04:02,639 --> 01:04:05,976
You and the other
children must stay here!

722
01:04:07,577 --> 01:04:10,080
Now, how can we close the wall?

723
01:04:10,114 --> 01:04:13,283
Any ideas? SPIKE'S
DAD: We must do it right away.

724
01:04:13,317 --> 01:04:15,352
Well, I'm not
going to stay here.

725
01:04:15,385 --> 01:04:18,022
I'm going to help whether the
grown-ups like it or not!

726
01:04:18,989 --> 01:04:21,325
Where's Chomper?
Has anyone seen him?

727
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:23,027
Chomper?

728
01:04:23,060 --> 01:04:24,995
Where did you go, Chomper?

729
01:04:26,396 --> 01:04:28,632
Me no see him anywhere!

730
01:04:28,665 --> 01:04:30,234
I have to find him!

731
01:04:30,267 --> 01:04:32,136
He's out there all alone!

732
01:04:32,169 --> 01:04:36,040
But, Littlefoot, your
grandpa said to stay here!

733
01:04:36,073 --> 01:04:40,310
Oh, he is going to be
in big trouble!

734
01:04:49,686 --> 01:04:50,988
Huh?

735
01:04:54,424 --> 01:04:57,094
Chomper. Am I glad
I found you!

736
01:05:00,297 --> 01:05:02,032
No biting, okay?

737
01:05:06,203 --> 01:05:07,337
Run!

738
01:05:11,441 --> 01:05:13,177
Faster, Chomper!

739
01:05:18,215 --> 01:05:19,383
Whoa!

740
01:05:24,288 --> 01:05:26,323
Go on, Chomper!
Save yourself!

741
01:05:45,042 --> 01:05:46,343
No! Don't!

742
01:05:57,487 --> 01:05:59,156
I think they're…

743
01:05:59,189 --> 01:06:00,957
They're his mama and papa!

744
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:26,083
We've had it with you, kid!

745
01:06:26,116 --> 01:06:29,119
We're getting rid of you
once and for all!

746
01:06:34,758 --> 01:06:37,127
Ahhh! Let me go!
Hey, Oz,

747
01:06:37,161 --> 01:06:40,064
can we throw him off the Great Wall?
Can we?

748
01:06:40,730 --> 01:06:42,999
Why, yes.

749
01:07:00,150 --> 01:07:03,153
Let me go, or you'll be sorry!

750
01:07:03,187 --> 01:07:05,755
Yeah, sorry we didn't
do this sooner.

751
01:07:05,789 --> 01:07:08,292
Say bye-bye, Leafeater!

752
01:07:09,559 --> 01:07:11,295
It's… It's…

753
01:07:11,328 --> 01:07:15,099
Oh, come on! Are you falling
for that shadow bit again?

754
01:07:15,132 --> 01:07:17,467
- Look.
- Chomper!

755
01:07:17,501 --> 01:07:19,403
Run!

756
01:07:19,436 --> 01:07:21,205
Gotcha!

757
01:07:21,238 --> 01:07:24,541
You I liked much better
as an egg!

758
01:07:24,574 --> 01:07:26,343
What the…

759
01:07:42,426 --> 01:07:45,262
Come on, Chomper, let's go.

760
01:07:56,573 --> 01:07:59,143
Hurry!
The opening!

761
01:07:59,176 --> 01:08:01,445
- We must close it.
- Come on, Chomper.

762
01:08:01,478 --> 01:08:05,115
We have to catch up
with your mom and dad.

763
01:08:05,149 --> 01:08:07,284
They're gonna close up
the opening, Chomper.

764
01:08:07,317 --> 01:08:09,353
You have to go now!

765
01:08:19,896 --> 01:08:22,466
I can't take care
of you anymore, Chomper.

766
01:08:22,499 --> 01:08:24,634
I'm… I'm just a kid.

767
01:08:26,503 --> 01:08:29,173
I know. I'll miss you too.

768
01:08:29,206 --> 01:08:31,808
But, maybe we'll
meet again someday.

769
01:08:31,841 --> 01:08:33,643
Go on, now. Hurry.

770
01:08:37,914 --> 01:08:39,483
Good bye, Chomper.
Bye, Chomper.

771
01:08:39,516 --> 01:08:41,251
Bye, Chomper.

772
01:08:45,322 --> 01:08:48,925
Littlefoot, are you sure
you saw the Sharpteeth leave?

773
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:52,496
Yes, Grandpa, they're back
in the Mysterious Beyond.

774
01:08:54,431 --> 01:08:56,500
You disobeyed me, Littlefoot.

775
01:08:56,533 --> 01:08:58,502
I'm sorry, Grandpa.

776
01:08:58,535 --> 01:09:02,172
It's just that I wanted to
make things right again.

777
01:09:02,206 --> 01:09:04,308
I know, Littlefoot.

778
01:09:04,341 --> 01:09:07,844
I also know that someday,
you'll understand

779
01:09:07,877 --> 01:09:10,580
why Grandma and I
worry about you.

780
01:09:10,614 --> 01:09:13,450
I think I already
do understand, Grandpa.

781
01:09:13,483 --> 01:09:17,521
Good. That means you'll
stay close to the herd.

782
01:09:24,961 --> 01:09:26,930
All right, everyone,

783
01:09:26,963 --> 01:09:28,665
get ready.

784
01:09:28,698 --> 01:09:31,301
Push! Push!

785
01:09:47,451 --> 01:09:49,185
Here they go!

786
01:09:53,323 --> 01:09:54,591
Hooray! It worked!

787
01:09:54,624 --> 01:09:56,993
We did it!
Closed!

788
01:09:57,026 --> 01:10:00,464
There. Now the Sharpteeth
won't ever be coming back.

789
01:10:15,011 --> 01:10:18,282
Ducky! Spike! Dinner!

790
01:10:18,315 --> 01:10:22,452
It is time
to go home! Yep, yep, yep!

791
01:10:22,486 --> 01:10:25,989
Petrie!
Me coming, Mama!

792
01:10:26,022 --> 01:10:27,324
- Bye, Petrie.
- Bye!

793
01:10:29,326 --> 01:10:30,660
Cera!

794
01:10:30,694 --> 01:10:32,696
See you tomorrow, Littlefoot.

795
01:10:32,729 --> 01:10:34,564
Littlefoot?

796
01:10:38,602 --> 01:10:40,404
Aren't you hungry?

797
01:10:41,771 --> 01:10:45,475
Grandma, Grandpa, I changed
my mind about something.

798
01:10:46,510 --> 01:10:48,412
What's that, Littlefoot?

799
01:10:48,445 --> 01:10:51,715
Well, I decided that I
really like being a kid.

800
01:10:51,748 --> 01:10:53,550
Oh?

801
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:55,952
But I still can't
wait to grow up!
