1
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:52,349
Have you ever felt like you were a little bit different?

2
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:55,386
Like you had something unique to offer the world...

3
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:58,683
...if you could just get people to see it.

4
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:04,159
Then you know exactly how it felt...

5
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,389
...to be me.

6
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:07,760
Go ahead, Flint.

7
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:14,303
What is the number one problem facing our community today?

8
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:16,298
Untied shoelaces.

9
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:21,880
Which is why I've invented a laceless alternative foot covering.

10
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:24,312
Spray-On Shoes.

11
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:30,122
- Voil¨¤. - They're so nifty.

12
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:33,016
How you gonna get them off, nerd?

13
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:40,898
What a freak. He wants to be smart, but that's lame.

14
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:49,467
I wanted to run away that day.

15
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:53,506
But you can't run away from your own feet.

16
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,220
Not every sardine is meant to swim, son.

17
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:09,753
I don't understand fishing metaphors.

18
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:12,193
- What did I say? - Don't worry.

19
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:18,163
Honey, I think your shoes are wonderful.

20
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:20,636
Everyone just thinks I'm a weirdo.

21
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,172
So?

22
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:25,311
People probably thought that these guys were weirdoes too.

23
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:28,544
But that never stopped them.

24
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:33,152
I was saving this for your birthday, but here.

25
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:36,117
A professional-grade lab coat.

26
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:38,189
Just like the real guys wear.

27
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,893
It fits perfect.

28
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:45,030
The world needs your originality, Flint.

29
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:48,891
You just have to grow into it.

30
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:52,697
And I know that you're gonna do big things someday.

31
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:17,786
From that moment on...

32
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:21,263
...I was determined to invent something great.

33
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:24,267
Remote Control Television.

34
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:28,130
And, the pitch is in.

35
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:30,266
Eventually.

36
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:32,604
Hair Un-Balder.

37
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,475
Flying Car.

38
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:40,047
Monkey Thought Translator.

39
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,949
- Hungry. Hungry. Hungry. - How wise.

40
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:46,558
No, Steve. No, no, no, no, no! No, please! Leave it...

41
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:48,616
Ratbirds.

42
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:50,888
Hey, what's going on, little guy?

43
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,055
Flint Lockwood.

44
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:56,829
My dream was to help my hometown...

45
00:03:57,003 --> 00:04:00,632
...a tiny island hidden under the "A" in "Atlantic"...

46
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,736
...called Swallow Falls.

47
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:06,574
We were famous for sardines...

48
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:11,076
...until the day the Baby Brent Sardine Cannery closed for good.

49
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:14,846
Right after everyone in the world realized that sardines...

50
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:16,215
...are super gross.

51
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:23,687
Soon, all of us were stuck eating the sardines that no one else wanted.

52
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:30,200
Poached, fried, boiled, dried, candied and juiced.

53
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,735
Life became gray and flavorless.

54
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:38,104
But when all seemed lost, I stared at defeat...

55
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,343
...and found hope.

56
00:05:22,407 --> 00:05:24,875
My name is Flint Lockwood.

57
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:28,311
And I was about to invent a machine...

58
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,310
...that turns water...

59
00:05:30,481 --> 00:05:32,642
...into food.

60
00:05:33,551 --> 00:05:37,544
Steve, my best friend and trusted colleague.

61
00:05:37,955 --> 00:05:38,979
Steve.

62
00:05:39,157 --> 00:05:41,887
Can I count on your help?

63
00:05:44,295 --> 00:05:45,319
Can.

64
00:05:46,664 --> 00:05:48,256
I knew I could.

65
00:05:48,433 --> 00:05:50,993
Button, on. Memory, activate.

66
00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:55,037
Blueprints, awesome. Begin nano-mutation.

67
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,801
Radiation matrix, secure.

68
00:05:58,376 --> 00:05:59,968
Computer, boot.

69
00:06:01,646 --> 00:06:03,807
Coolness enhancement, complete.

70
00:06:03,981 --> 00:06:05,812
Engage coffee break.

71
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,181
Networking power grid.

72
00:06:19,197 --> 00:06:22,189
Beginning conversion of water...

73
00:06:22,366 --> 00:06:24,027
...into food.

74
00:06:24,202 --> 00:06:26,261
Hydrating protein matrix.

75
00:06:26,737 --> 00:06:29,365
Calibrating flavor panel.

76
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,373
Priming chow plopper.

77
00:06:32,977 --> 00:06:36,037
Uploading cool machine voice.

78
00:06:37,415 --> 00:06:38,973
Cheeseburger.

79
00:06:39,917 --> 00:06:43,910
Everyone is going to love this.

80
00:07:09,714 --> 00:07:10,942
Flint!

81
00:07:11,115 --> 00:07:12,582
Sorry, Dad.

82
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:15,018
Steve, keep working.

83
00:07:18,422 --> 00:07:20,754
Scanning hand.

84
00:07:38,242 --> 00:07:40,836
That's a really weird dude.

85
00:07:45,316 --> 00:07:47,978
Re-energizing tower unit.

86
00:07:53,124 --> 00:07:55,183
Jeez. See you, Dad.

87
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:58,418
Flint.

88
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:07,696
Don't you think it's time to give up this inventing thing, get a real job?

89
00:08:07,872 --> 00:08:09,362
No, why?

90
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:13,977
Well, all your technology stuff, it just ends in disaster.

91
00:08:14,145 --> 00:08:17,012
The ratbirds, yes, they escaped and bred at a surprising rate.

92
00:08:17,181 --> 00:08:19,843
But I took care of that problem and disposed of them.

93
00:08:20,017 --> 00:08:21,848
Billy, just play dead.

94
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:26,251
Flint, you don't keep throwing your net where there aren't any fish.

95
00:08:26,424 --> 00:08:28,187
- What? - I want you to work full-time...

96
00:08:28,359 --> 00:08:31,055
...at the tackle shop. - The tackle shop? Dad, no.

97
00:08:31,228 --> 00:08:32,820
Tackle is a good career.

98
00:08:32,997 --> 00:08:34,624
Please, I'm so close with this one.

99
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,929
I just have to hook it up to the power station and give it power and it'll work.

100
00:08:39,103 --> 00:08:41,128
And then you could sell food in the shop...

101
00:08:41,305 --> 00:08:44,069
...and then everyone won't have to eat sardines anymore.

102
00:08:44,241 --> 00:08:47,836
It is going to be so awesome.

103
00:08:48,546 --> 00:08:50,605
I'm sorry, son.

104
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:51,907
No more inventing.

105
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:55,211
Dad, I know I can do this.

106
00:08:55,386 --> 00:08:56,580
And Mom did too.

107
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:02,384
It had been almost 10 years since Mom died...

108
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,893
...and Dad still didn't understand me like she did.

109
00:09:06,063 --> 00:09:09,521
Come on. Let's open the shop.

110
00:09:12,303 --> 00:09:15,170
Tim and Son Sardine Bait and Tackle.

111
00:09:16,641 --> 00:09:18,438
You feeling it?

112
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:24,780
Look out, Baby Brent!

113
00:09:26,717 --> 00:09:28,241
Baby Brent Sardines.

114
00:09:28,419 --> 00:09:31,047
Hand-packed in Swallow Falls.

115
00:09:31,222 --> 00:09:36,023
As your mayor, I know it's time to put our sardine-canning past behind us...

116
00:09:36,193 --> 00:09:38,491
...and look to the future.

117
00:09:38,663 --> 00:09:40,722
Sardine tourism!

118
00:09:42,133 --> 00:09:44,158
That's why, without consulting anyone...

119
00:09:44,335 --> 00:09:47,964
...I spent the entire town budget on the thing that is under this tarp...

120
00:09:48,139 --> 00:09:50,607
...which I will be unveiling today...

121
00:09:50,775 --> 00:09:52,606
...at noon.

122
00:09:52,777 --> 00:09:57,407
Featuring a live appearance by Baby Brent himself.

123
00:09:57,581 --> 00:10:00,880
What is up, everybody?

124
00:10:01,052 --> 00:10:02,986
- Hey. - Hey, it's Baby Brent.

125
00:10:03,154 --> 00:10:07,215
What you doing? Stacking cans with me on them as a baby?

126
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,092
Anyways, who wants to watch me cut the ribbon...

127
00:10:12,263 --> 00:10:13,855
...at the mayor's unveiling thing?

128
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:17,762
I'll be using these bad boys to help save the town.

129
00:10:20,337 --> 00:10:23,170
All right, you guys. Sardines, yeah.

130
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:27,174
- Swallow Falls forever! - What a delight.

131
00:10:27,344 --> 00:10:31,178
Listen, you... Maybe you wanna go to that unveiling?

132
00:10:31,348 --> 00:10:35,307
You know, Dad, why don't you go ahead. I'll hold down the fort here.

133
00:10:35,486 --> 00:10:38,387
Really? You sure you can handle it?

134
00:10:38,556 --> 00:10:40,888
Yeah, Dad, I'm pretty sure I'll be fine.

135
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:42,619
All right, then.

136
00:10:42,793 --> 00:10:45,728
I'll be back in half an hour, skipper.

137
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:48,091
Okay. Bye.

138
00:10:55,906 --> 00:10:58,807
This hellhole is too small for me, Brent.

139
00:10:58,976 --> 00:11:00,876
I wanna be big.

140
00:11:01,045 --> 00:11:05,505
I want people to look at me and say, "That is one big mayor."

141
00:11:05,683 --> 00:11:07,548
And that's why this has to work.

142
00:11:07,718 --> 00:11:09,379
It has to work.

143
00:11:09,553 --> 00:11:12,716
Otherwise, I'm just a tiny mayor of a tiny town...

144
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:16,257
...full of tiny sardine-sucking knuckle-scrapers.

145
00:11:16,427 --> 00:11:17,894
But not me, right?

146
00:11:18,062 --> 00:11:22,556
Oh, not you, Brent. No. You've always been like a son to me.

147
00:11:25,169 --> 00:11:27,399
Hey, everybody.

148
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:34,371
Under this tarp is the greatest tourist attraction ever built by humans.

149
00:11:34,545 --> 00:11:37,139
We just need 17,000 more gigajoules.

150
00:11:37,314 --> 00:11:40,215
- An attraction so... - Go, go, go.

151
00:11:41,652 --> 00:11:43,415
What are you doing, Flint Lockwood?

152
00:11:43,587 --> 00:11:46,112
Just holding my hands behind my back respectfully, sir.

153
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,224
- You know what you are, Lockwood? - No.

154
00:11:48,392 --> 00:11:50,223
A shenaniganizer.

155
00:11:50,394 --> 00:11:51,759
A tomfool.

156
00:11:51,929 --> 00:11:54,193
- You see my beautiful angel son Cal? - What's up?

157
00:11:54,365 --> 00:11:56,856
I love him so much. This is my only son.

158
00:11:57,034 --> 00:11:58,661
I want him to have a bright future.

159
00:11:58,836 --> 00:12:01,100
A future in which you don't ruin our town's day...

160
00:12:01,272 --> 00:12:03,502
...with one of your crazy science thingies.

161
00:12:03,674 --> 00:12:06,837
- Well, that's all behind me... - You see this contact lens, Lockwood?

162
00:12:07,011 --> 00:12:09,070
- This contact lens represent you. - All right.

163
00:12:09,246 --> 00:12:11,476
- And my eye represents my eye. - Okay.

164
00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:16,382
I got my eye on you.

165
00:12:16,554 --> 00:12:19,819
- Oh, my gosh, a jaywalker. - Hey.

166
00:12:20,491 --> 00:12:24,427
And I've arranged for live coverage from a major network...

167
00:12:24,595 --> 00:12:28,156
...and their most experienced professional reporter.

168
00:12:29,533 --> 00:12:32,366
Oh, just send the intern. She's cute, and she's super perky.

169
00:12:32,536 --> 00:12:36,768
Well, those are the only things we look for in a TV weatherperson. Intern.

170
00:12:36,941 --> 00:12:40,138
How would you like to do a weather report from a rinky-dink island...

171
00:12:40,311 --> 00:12:42,802
...in the middle of the ocean as a favor to my cousin?

172
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,038
Really?

173
00:12:44,682 --> 00:12:46,081
Can you believe it, Manny?

174
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:49,811
Temporary professional meteorologist.

175
00:12:49,987 --> 00:12:51,545
Okay, Manny, what about this?

176
00:12:51,722 --> 00:12:53,553
Welcome, America, I'm Sam Sparks.

177
00:12:53,724 --> 00:12:56,090
Hello, America, Sam Sparks here.

178
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,319
America, hi. I didn't see you there.

179
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,860
It's me, Sam Sparks.

180
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:04,399
On my way across the ocean.

181
00:13:04,902 --> 00:13:09,532
Now, when she gets here, I wanna see a lot of smiling faces.

182
00:13:09,707 --> 00:13:11,368
Act like, "Hey, whoa."

183
00:13:12,076 --> 00:13:15,375
This is a great idea.

184
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:17,570
Weather News Network.

185
00:13:17,748 --> 00:13:19,375
Weather news happens...

186
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,881
...or not.

187
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:22,643
Now we're over to Swallow Falls...

188
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,152
...where our intern is on her first day on the job.

189
00:13:25,322 --> 00:13:27,984
Or should I say, first gray on the job.

190
00:13:28,158 --> 00:13:29,750
Looks pretty cloudy there, intern.

191
00:13:29,927 --> 00:13:31,861
Hello, Sam Sparks, I'm America.

192
00:13:32,396 --> 00:13:37,299
It's Swallow Falls degrees and... Well, let's just go to the mayor.

193
00:13:37,468 --> 00:13:41,768
Thank you and welcome, national television audience.

194
00:13:41,939 --> 00:13:46,535
You are about to witness an historic event, undoubtedly...

195
00:13:49,947 --> 00:13:53,280
And now, here to cut the ceremonial ribbon...

196
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:58,649
...Swallow Falls' favorite son, Baby Brent!

197
00:13:58,822 --> 00:14:00,187
He's still got it, folks.

198
00:14:00,357 --> 00:14:01,483
Yeah.

199
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:07,156
I'm the best person in the whole town.

200
00:14:12,503 --> 00:14:15,438
Food synthesis, go.

201
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:21,443
My chest hairs are tingling. Something's wrong.

202
00:14:22,212 --> 00:14:27,479
Well, here it is. The attraction the whole world has been waiting for:

203
00:14:27,651 --> 00:14:29,778
Sardine Land.

204
00:14:32,022 --> 00:14:34,149
With rides and exhibits.

205
00:14:34,325 --> 00:14:38,386
And featuring Shamo, the world's largest sardine...

206
00:14:38,562 --> 00:14:41,793
...and his flaming hoop of glory.

207
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:45,658
Those of you in the splash zone, look out.

208
00:14:45,836 --> 00:14:46,962
Yeah.

209
00:14:54,011 --> 00:14:55,842
Cheeseburger.

210
00:14:56,013 --> 00:14:57,071
Flint Lockwood.

211
00:14:57,247 --> 00:15:00,478
Just a second. I'm in the middle of a...

212
00:15:09,059 --> 00:15:15,191
Well, looks like things in Swallow Falls are sardine to get better. For...

213
00:15:15,366 --> 00:15:17,129
What just happened to me?

214
00:15:17,301 --> 00:15:18,461
Sorry.

215
00:15:40,024 --> 00:15:41,855
No.

216
00:15:42,793 --> 00:15:44,488
You're under arrest, Flint Lockwood.

217
00:15:44,661 --> 00:15:49,098
Thank goodness you only caused minimal damage to Sardine Land.

218
00:15:55,005 --> 00:15:56,029
Come on.

219
00:16:05,582 --> 00:16:08,073
I really shouldn't be running with these.

220
00:16:11,522 --> 00:16:14,184
Jump, jump, jump, run, run, jump, jump, run.

221
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:38,473
- It's a good thing no one got hurt! - Flint Lockwood!

222
00:16:38,649 --> 00:16:42,847
I didn't get hurt, but that does not mean that I'm not still mad at you.

223
00:17:48,118 --> 00:17:50,348
Oh, my gosh. I am so sorry. Are you okay?

224
00:17:50,521 --> 00:17:53,513
- I didn't get a chance to... - It's okay, it's just pain.

225
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:55,282
Sorry, I'm not myself today.

226
00:17:55,459 --> 00:18:00,396
My whole career was ruined by some crazy jerk riding a homemade rocket.

227
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:03,159
Wait a minute.

228
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,801
What is going on with your feet?

229
00:18:05,969 --> 00:18:08,699
Spray-On Shoes. They don't come off.

230
00:18:08,872 --> 00:18:10,237
Cool.

231
00:18:11,108 --> 00:18:13,133
This could solve the untied shoes epidemic.

232
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:16,370
What are they made of, some kind of elastic biopolymer adhesive?

233
00:18:16,547 --> 00:18:17,980
Yeah.

234
00:18:18,148 --> 00:18:19,172
Exactly.

235
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:21,078
I mean...

236
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:24,885
Wow, they're shiny. I'm Sam.

237
00:18:25,822 --> 00:18:27,050
- Flint. - Steve.

238
00:18:27,658 --> 00:18:30,218
- Is that a Monkey Thought Translator? - Steve.

239
00:18:31,595 --> 00:18:35,929
Incredible. Did you make all of this stuff?

240
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:39,063
- You hit me with a rocket. - You kicked me in the face.

241
00:18:39,236 --> 00:18:41,329
I said I was sorry.

242
00:18:42,139 --> 00:18:45,506
Do you know how hard it is to break into the weather game?

243
00:18:45,676 --> 00:18:49,373
I spent my entire life building up to that moment.

244
00:18:50,147 --> 00:18:52,274
You get one shot at the show.

245
00:18:52,449 --> 00:18:54,542
And if you don't make it...

246
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:58,210
...it's back to cleaning the barometers.

247
00:19:05,295 --> 00:19:06,956
Cheese?

248
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:15,132
But that could only mean...

249
00:20:02,252 --> 00:20:05,153
Excited. Excited.

250
00:20:15,565 --> 00:20:16,930
My machine works.

251
00:20:18,802 --> 00:20:22,966
It really works!

252
00:20:26,009 --> 00:20:27,499
Your machine?

253
00:20:27,678 --> 00:20:29,373
Is that what that rocket was?

254
00:20:30,881 --> 00:20:32,508
Do you like it?

255
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:33,940
I love it!

256
00:20:34,418 --> 00:20:36,852
This is just amazing. Look at this.

257
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,818
This is the greatest weather phenomenon in history.

258
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,958
Hey, aren't you a weathergirl?

259
00:20:44,861 --> 00:20:46,829
Manny, get your camera.

260
00:21:02,412 --> 00:21:06,849
This just in: Our humiliated weather intern is apparently back for more.

261
00:21:07,017 --> 00:21:10,316
Thanks, Patrick. Okay, everybody, you are not gonna believe this one...

262
00:21:10,487 --> 00:21:14,924
...but I am standing in the middle of a burger rain.

263
00:21:15,092 --> 00:21:16,719
You may have seen a meteor shower...

264
00:21:16,893 --> 00:21:20,693
...but you've never seen a shower meatier than this.

265
00:21:20,864 --> 00:21:24,994
For a town stuck eating sardines, this is totally manna from heaven.

266
00:21:25,168 --> 00:21:28,160
This tastes significantly better than sardines.

267
00:21:35,178 --> 00:21:37,840
This is going to be big.

268
00:21:38,014 --> 00:21:40,107
This food weather was created intentionally...

269
00:21:40,283 --> 00:21:43,480
...by meek-ish backyard tinkerer Flint Lockwood.

270
00:21:43,653 --> 00:21:45,644
Flint Lockwood?

271
00:21:45,822 --> 00:21:46,846
Hi.

272
00:21:47,023 --> 00:21:49,082
You're under arrest for ruining Sardine Land.

273
00:21:49,259 --> 00:21:50,851
Flint, those burgers were awesome.

274
00:21:51,027 --> 00:21:54,394
The producer called and he was like, "Everybody loves that food weather."

275
00:21:54,564 --> 00:21:55,758
- Food weather. - What?

276
00:21:55,932 --> 00:21:57,729
This could be bigger than Sardine Land.

277
00:21:57,901 --> 00:21:59,664
- Can you make it rain food again? - No.

278
00:21:59,836 --> 00:22:02,031
- I don't know if l... - You're gonna do it again?

279
00:22:02,205 --> 00:22:03,536
You gotta be kidding.

280
00:22:03,707 --> 00:22:05,902
Please, please, please.

281
00:22:08,812 --> 00:22:10,609
- Yes. - No.

282
00:22:10,781 --> 00:22:13,477
- Give me one more chance. - We know this was an accident.

283
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:15,777
- I know. - Cheeseburgers from the sky...

284
00:22:15,952 --> 00:22:17,544
...that's not natural.

285
00:22:17,721 --> 00:22:20,383
My invention could save the whole town.

286
00:22:20,557 --> 00:22:23,151
You will be so proud of me, Dad.

287
00:22:23,326 --> 00:22:25,123
Plus...

288
00:22:25,295 --> 00:22:26,660
...there's a girl here.

289
00:22:28,965 --> 00:22:32,924
Can you look me in the eye and tell me you've got this under control...

290
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:35,128
...and it's not gonna end up in a disaster?

291
00:22:36,006 --> 00:22:37,268
Yes.

292
00:22:51,855 --> 00:22:54,949
I've got this under control, and it's not gonna end in disaster.

293
00:22:57,227 --> 00:22:59,286
- All right. - Thanks, Dad.

294
00:22:59,463 --> 00:23:02,694
- Oh, sure. - Okay. So, Sam...

295
00:23:02,866 --> 00:23:06,962
...this is where the magic happens.

296
00:23:08,271 --> 00:23:11,638
Lick. Lick. Lick.

297
00:23:11,808 --> 00:23:15,039
Lick. Lick. Lick.

298
00:23:16,513 --> 00:23:17,946
Welcome, Flint.

299
00:23:20,317 --> 00:23:22,877
You seriously spend a lot of time alone.

300
00:23:23,053 --> 00:23:24,486
What?

301
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:28,387
So here's how it works.

302
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:32,551
Water goes in the top, and food comes out the bottom.

303
00:23:32,729 --> 00:23:34,594
When you shot it into the stratosphere...

304
00:23:34,764 --> 00:23:38,495
...you figured it would induce a phase change from the cumulonimbus layer?

305
00:23:38,668 --> 00:23:41,660
That's actually a really smart observation.

306
00:23:41,838 --> 00:23:43,533
I mean...

307
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:46,775
The clouds probably have water in them...

308
00:23:46,943 --> 00:23:50,344
...which, I guess, is why you shot it up there in the first place.

309
00:23:50,514 --> 00:23:52,641
Right, right. That's why I did that.

310
00:23:52,816 --> 00:23:54,807
- On purpose. - Right. Yeah.

311
00:23:54,985 --> 00:23:56,714
- Right. - Of course.

312
00:23:58,255 --> 00:23:59,813
Okay.

313
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:03,084
The machine uses a principle of hydro-genetic mutation.

314
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:06,252
Water molecules are bombarded with microwave radiation...

315
00:24:06,429 --> 00:24:09,887
...which mutates their genetic recipe into any kind of food you want.

316
00:24:10,066 --> 00:24:11,226
So...

317
00:24:11,401 --> 00:24:12,425
- Pizza? - Yes.

318
00:24:12,602 --> 00:24:13,728
- Mashed potatoes? - Yes.

319
00:24:13,904 --> 00:24:15,371
- Peas? - Yes, that's also a food.

320
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:16,767
- Steak? Apples? - Yes.

321
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,373
- Apple sauce? BLT? - Yes.

322
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:20,703
- I said any kind of food. - Chicken wings?

323
00:24:20,877 --> 00:24:23,539
Think about what you're saying, and if it's a food, yes.

324
00:24:23,713 --> 00:24:26,011
- Baloney. - Baloney. That is a food.

325
00:24:26,182 --> 00:24:28,446
- How about Jell-O? - Do you like Jell-O?

326
00:24:28,618 --> 00:24:30,085
I love Jell-O.

327
00:24:30,253 --> 00:24:32,653
I love Jell-O too. Oh, and peanut butter, right?

328
00:24:32,822 --> 00:24:35,222
Oh, no, no, no, I am severely allergic to peanuts.

329
00:24:35,392 --> 00:24:36,416
Hey, me too.

330
00:24:36,593 --> 00:24:38,185
- What's it called? - Peanut allergy.

331
00:24:38,361 --> 00:24:39,419
- No, the machine. - Of course.

332
00:24:39,996 --> 00:24:42,794
It's called the Flint Lockwood Diatonic Super-Mutating...

333
00:24:42,966 --> 00:24:45,093
...Dynamic Food Replicator.

334
00:24:45,268 --> 00:24:46,929
Or, for short:

335
00:24:47,103 --> 00:24:48,866
The FLDSMDFR.

336
00:24:49,372 --> 00:24:50,464
Fliminadifiser?

337
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,971
FLDSMDFR.

338
00:24:52,142 --> 00:24:53,541
Fliminubahdibferer?

339
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:55,337
Fli.

340
00:24:55,512 --> 00:24:57,275
Suh.

341
00:24:57,547 --> 00:24:58,809
Fdiferf.

342
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:03,051
Manny, make sure you get this. He's gonna make the food now.

343
00:25:03,219 --> 00:25:04,243
Now?

344
00:25:04,421 --> 00:25:08,152
Well, the thing is, I can't...

345
00:25:08,325 --> 00:25:11,385
...wait to show you this hilarious Internet video.

346
00:25:12,495 --> 00:25:13,519
What?

347
00:25:13,697 --> 00:25:14,925
Fight the power!

348
00:25:15,098 --> 00:25:17,066
What is this?

349
00:25:21,538 --> 00:25:22,835
It's so cute.

350
00:25:23,006 --> 00:25:24,837
Pushing. Folding. Connecting.

351
00:25:25,008 --> 00:25:27,806
Taping. Turning. Painting. Switching.

352
00:25:27,978 --> 00:25:29,104
Staring.

353
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:30,644
Motivating.

354
00:25:30,814 --> 00:25:33,339
- Placing button. - I can't believe I've been watching this...

355
00:25:33,516 --> 00:25:35,575
...for three hours. - I know.

356
00:25:44,828 --> 00:25:46,022
It's working.

357
00:25:46,196 --> 00:25:48,187
What do you guys want for breakfast?

358
00:25:48,365 --> 00:25:50,356
- Gummi Bears. - Whoa, Steve, no.

359
00:25:50,533 --> 00:25:52,694
We both know how you get around Gummi Bears.

360
00:25:52,869 --> 00:25:54,268
How about...

361
00:25:54,437 --> 00:25:55,995
...eggs. - And toast.

362
00:25:56,172 --> 00:25:57,469
Orange juice.

363
00:25:57,641 --> 00:25:59,336
- And bacon. - Bacon.

364
00:26:00,343 --> 00:26:01,674
What are you doing?

365
00:26:01,845 --> 00:26:03,278
Nothing.

366
00:26:03,446 --> 00:26:04,470
To the computer.

367
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:11,853
So you're sure this is safe?

368
00:26:12,389 --> 00:26:14,880
Don't worry. I have a Dangeometer that lets us know...

369
00:26:15,058 --> 00:26:16,821
...if the food is going to over-mutate.

370
00:26:16,993 --> 00:26:18,893
What happens if the food over-mutates?

371
00:26:19,062 --> 00:26:21,462
I don't know. But that'll never happen.

372
00:26:21,631 --> 00:26:23,997
All right, this probably won't explode.

373
00:26:24,167 --> 00:26:25,191
What?

374
00:26:31,908 --> 00:26:33,569
Bacon.

375
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:42,243
Those cheeseburgers were only the beginning...

376
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:45,183
...because a breakfast system is on its way to Swallow Falls.

377
00:26:45,355 --> 00:26:46,549
My forecast?

378
00:26:46,723 --> 00:26:48,657
Sunny side up.

379
00:26:56,032 --> 00:26:58,500
- Yeah. - Yeah.

380
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:10,411
Flint, my boy. Can you do lunch?

381
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,911
All right, here's the skinny:

382
00:27:12,082 --> 00:27:14,949
You keep making it rain the snackadoos...

383
00:27:15,118 --> 00:27:17,086
...weathergirl provides free advertising...

384
00:27:17,253 --> 00:27:19,448
...I have taken out a very high-interest loan...

385
00:27:19,622 --> 00:27:22,682
...to convert this Podunk town into a tourist food-topia.

386
00:27:22,859 --> 00:27:26,260
All you have to do is make it rain food three meals a day...

387
00:27:26,429 --> 00:27:28,397
...every day for the foreseeable future...

388
00:27:28,565 --> 00:27:31,329
...and in 30 days we hold a grand reopening of the island...

389
00:27:31,501 --> 00:27:34,299
...as a must-see cruise destination.

390
00:27:34,471 --> 00:27:37,099
And everyone, everywhere...

391
00:27:37,273 --> 00:27:41,607
...is going to love your invention.

392
00:27:41,978 --> 00:27:43,275
Do you think so?

393
00:27:43,446 --> 00:27:45,880
I know so.

394
00:27:50,253 --> 00:27:53,245
Now that's what I call poultry in motion.

395
00:28:03,166 --> 00:28:05,726
Mr. Lockwood, may I please have waffles?

396
00:28:05,902 --> 00:28:07,233
- Falafels? - Jellybeans.

397
00:28:07,403 --> 00:28:08,768
- Avocado. - Coming right up.

398
00:28:11,641 --> 00:28:12,835
Leftovers?

399
00:28:13,009 --> 00:28:16,376
Not a problem with Flint Lockwood's latest invention, the Outtasighter...

400
00:28:16,546 --> 00:28:19,447
...so-named because it catapults uneaten food out of sight...

401
00:28:19,616 --> 00:28:22,107
...and therefore, out of mind.

402
00:28:30,794 --> 00:28:32,489
Jellybeans!

403
00:28:32,662 --> 00:28:33,686
Awesome.

404
00:28:33,863 --> 00:28:36,161
- BLT. - Doughnuts.

405
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,365
Pie.

406
00:28:38,535 --> 00:28:39,559
Gummi bears.

407
00:28:39,769 --> 00:28:42,033
- Fish. - Creme brul¨¦e!

408
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,374
A pizza stuffed inside a turkey...

409
00:28:46,543 --> 00:28:49,341
...the whole thing deep-fried and dipped in chocolate.

410
00:28:50,046 --> 00:28:51,911
It's me, the mayor.

411
00:28:52,515 --> 00:28:53,880
You look different.

412
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:55,813
Did you get a new haircut?

413
00:28:55,985 --> 00:28:58,010
Yes, I did. Thank you for noticing.

414
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:07,096
- I love you. - Thanks, Dad. I love you.

415
00:29:07,096 --> 00:29:08,620
- I love you. - Thanks, Dad. I love you.

416
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:10,561
I love spending time with you, Dad.

417
00:29:14,838 --> 00:29:17,466
Hey, Dad, I'm headed back to the lab.

418
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:21,474
If you wanna come, I could show you how I make the food.

419
00:29:21,978 --> 00:29:23,468
No, thanks.

420
00:29:23,646 --> 00:29:28,777
That techno-food, it's too complicated for an old fisherman.

421
00:29:28,952 --> 00:29:30,817
Got it.

422
00:29:31,754 --> 00:29:35,155
Could still use your help around here, though, you know.

423
00:29:35,325 --> 00:29:37,987
I'm working with the mayor now, Dad.

424
00:29:38,161 --> 00:29:41,324
I mean, the town's grand reopening is in, like, a week.

425
00:29:41,497 --> 00:29:43,761
Right. Got it.

426
00:29:50,473 --> 00:29:52,805
Flint Lockwood?

427
00:29:53,443 --> 00:29:55,070
Yeah?

428
00:29:56,546 --> 00:29:58,810
It's my son Cal's birthday tomorrow...

429
00:29:58,982 --> 00:30:02,383
...and I was just wondering if you could make it rain something special.

430
00:30:02,552 --> 00:30:04,952
Well, I'm pretty backed up on requests.

431
00:30:05,121 --> 00:30:06,782
Plus, you're always mean to me.

432
00:30:06,956 --> 00:30:08,787
It'll be just one time...

433
00:30:08,958 --> 00:30:11,426
...for my special angel's special day.

434
00:30:12,695 --> 00:30:14,060
I don't know.

435
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:17,529
You know, I don't wanna overwork the machine, so...

436
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:21,192
Okay. I knew it was a long shot.

437
00:30:21,371 --> 00:30:24,101
I just wanted Cal to see how much his father loves him.

438
00:30:24,274 --> 00:30:26,037
I thought you would understand.

439
00:30:29,012 --> 00:30:31,207
You know how fathers always trying to express...

440
00:30:31,381 --> 00:30:35,044
...their love and appreciation for their sons.

441
00:30:38,888 --> 00:30:39,946
Earl, wait.

442
00:30:51,434 --> 00:30:53,595
Touch. Touch. Touch.

443
00:30:55,738 --> 00:30:56,966
I've got an idea.

444
00:31:15,058 --> 00:31:16,958
Happy birthday, son.

445
00:31:17,126 --> 00:31:18,286
Dad?

446
00:31:18,461 --> 00:31:20,793
This is your day. Go have fun.

447
00:31:20,964 --> 00:31:24,525
- I love you guys. You're awesome. - I love you too, son.

448
00:31:24,701 --> 00:31:28,296
- Have a good time, baby. - Ice cream!

449
00:31:29,172 --> 00:31:32,266
Yeah! Cool.

450
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:36,605
Strawberry's my favorite.

451
00:31:48,858 --> 00:31:49,882
Come on, Dad.

452
00:31:50,059 --> 00:31:51,549
I don't know, Cal.

453
00:31:51,728 --> 00:31:54,094
This doesn't look safe!

454
00:32:02,005 --> 00:32:03,131
I love you, son.

455
00:32:03,306 --> 00:32:06,469
I know, Dad. You tell me every day.

456
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,343
Flint, this is amazing.

457
00:32:12,515 --> 00:32:15,109
And designing the ice cream to accumulate into scoops...

458
00:32:15,284 --> 00:32:17,184
...I don't know how you're gonna top this.

459
00:32:17,353 --> 00:32:20,220
Maybe with hot fudge.

460
00:32:22,392 --> 00:32:23,484
Hey, Flint.

461
00:32:23,659 --> 00:32:25,684
You wanna be in a snowball fight with us?

462
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:28,822
Flint, what's the problem?

463
00:32:28,998 --> 00:32:31,193
I've never actually been in a snowball fight.

464
00:32:31,367 --> 00:32:33,597
- Really? - I don't even know the rules.

465
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:37,399
Is there like a point system or is it...

466
00:32:37,573 --> 00:32:39,438
...to the death? - No...

467
00:32:39,609 --> 00:32:44,637
You've nev...? I mean, look, even Steve is throwing chocolate snowballs.

468
00:32:49,352 --> 00:32:52,788
So like this?

469
00:32:53,322 --> 00:32:55,517
No, harder than that.

470
00:32:57,927 --> 00:33:00,521
Snowball. Snowball, snowball, snowball.

471
00:33:01,531 --> 00:33:04,022
Snowball. Snowball.

472
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,192
Well, something to be said for enthusiasm.

473
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:09,362
Snowball!

474
00:33:09,872 --> 00:33:11,464
Snowball!

475
00:33:14,677 --> 00:33:16,577
Snowball and snowball.

476
00:33:16,746 --> 00:33:17,804
Kids? What's going on?

477
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:20,073
Snowball.

478
00:33:21,317 --> 00:33:23,148
- Snowball. - Snowball. Snowball.

479
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:24,650
I scream, you scream...

480
00:33:24,821 --> 00:33:29,121
...we all scream for Flint Lockwood's latest tasty town-wide treat...

481
00:33:29,292 --> 00:33:32,352
...with flurries of frozen fun on what the mayor declared to be...

482
00:33:32,528 --> 00:33:33,961
...an ice cream snow day.

483
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:37,657
He'd also like to invite everyone in the world to catch a cruise liner...

484
00:33:37,834 --> 00:33:39,461
...and come on down this Saturday...

485
00:33:39,635 --> 00:33:42,126
...for the grand opening of Chew And Swallow...

486
00:33:42,305 --> 00:33:45,468
<i>...a town that is truly ¨¤ la mode.</i>

487
00:33:53,182 --> 00:33:56,242
A town that is truly topped with ice cream.

488
00:33:56,419 --> 00:33:59,354
With today's scoop for the Weather News Network...

489
00:33:59,522 --> 00:34:01,888
...l'm Sam Sparks.

490
00:34:02,058 --> 00:34:05,789
Flint, this is the best breakfast ever.

491
00:34:12,335 --> 00:34:13,359
That's it!

492
00:34:13,536 --> 00:34:15,265
Researching. Role-playing.

493
00:34:15,438 --> 00:34:16,837
Dialing.

494
00:34:17,006 --> 00:34:18,633
Waiting.

495
00:34:20,877 --> 00:34:22,777
- Sam Sparks. - Hanging up.

496
00:34:22,945 --> 00:34:25,175
Regretting. Re-psyching.

497
00:34:25,348 --> 00:34:27,213
Saying what I'm doing.

498
00:34:27,383 --> 00:34:29,408
- Flint? - "Hi, Sam, how are you? That's nice.

499
00:34:29,585 --> 00:34:31,849
I was wondering if you would like to go on a da..."

500
00:34:32,021 --> 00:34:33,352
Activity with me tomorrow.

501
00:34:35,424 --> 00:34:37,858
- Okay. - Great, bye. Meet me in the forest.

502
00:34:38,027 --> 00:34:40,461
Nailed it. Gotta go, Steve.

503
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:43,690
Keep an eye on the lab for me.

504
00:34:45,234 --> 00:34:47,600
Steve.

505
00:34:48,037 --> 00:34:49,732
Foster still at the plate.

506
00:34:49,906 --> 00:34:51,840
And nobody out.

507
00:34:52,008 --> 00:34:53,475
Where are we going?

508
00:34:53,643 --> 00:34:55,873
Oh, nowhere. I just thought it'd be nice...

509
00:34:56,045 --> 00:35:00,106
...for the two of us to go on a walk together.

510
00:35:00,283 --> 00:35:03,309
Like you do as friends.

511
00:35:03,753 --> 00:35:06,813
Oh, my, what's that?

512
00:35:15,898 --> 00:35:17,559
Jell-O's my favorite.

513
00:35:18,234 --> 00:35:20,532
You never made a request, so...

514
00:35:20,703 --> 00:35:22,534
...I made one for you.

515
00:35:25,374 --> 00:35:27,205
Flint?

516
00:35:27,376 --> 00:35:28,741
Flint?

517
00:35:29,145 --> 00:35:30,772
Join me.

518
00:35:44,493 --> 00:35:45,619
But how did you...?

519
00:35:45,795 --> 00:35:48,992
I made it rain Jell-O, then I gathered it up with the Outtasighter...

520
00:35:49,165 --> 00:35:51,292
...and then I brought it here and pressed it...

521
00:35:51,467 --> 00:35:55,028
...into a gigantic custom-carved plastic Tupperware mold I made. No big deal.

522
00:35:56,939 --> 00:35:59,237
Everything's made of Jell-O.

523
00:35:59,408 --> 00:36:00,898
This piano, those sconces...

524
00:36:01,077 --> 00:36:03,545
...that ghetto blaster, that Jell-O, that aquarium...

525
00:36:03,713 --> 00:36:05,806
...that Venus de Milo with your face on it...

526
00:36:05,982 --> 00:36:08,917
...next to a Michelangelo's David that also has your face.

527
00:36:09,719 --> 00:36:12,916
Come on, Sam, what are you waiting for?

528
00:36:15,091 --> 00:36:16,388
Nothing!

529
00:36:19,128 --> 00:36:20,152
Yeah.

530
00:36:33,175 --> 00:36:34,904
Cannonball.

531
00:36:36,312 --> 00:36:37,779
Belly flop.

532
00:36:41,417 --> 00:36:43,408
Why did I do that?

533
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,894
- So Jell-O. - Right. Right, right.

534
00:36:54,063 --> 00:36:55,530
It's a solid, it's a liquid...

535
00:36:55,698 --> 00:37:00,192
...it's a visco-elastic polymer made of polypeptide chains, but you eat it.

536
00:37:00,369 --> 00:37:02,030
I mean...

537
00:37:02,204 --> 00:37:04,263
...it tastes good.

538
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,374
- Why do you do that? - Do what?

539
00:37:06,542 --> 00:37:10,672
Say something super smart and then bail from it.

540
00:37:12,415 --> 00:37:13,473
Can you keep a secret?

541
00:37:13,649 --> 00:37:15,412
No.

542
00:37:16,385 --> 00:37:18,876
But this time, sure, yeah.

543
00:37:20,022 --> 00:37:25,983
Okay. Well, it was a really long time ago, but I, too, was...

544
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:28,888
...a nerd.

545
00:37:29,498 --> 00:37:30,522
Too?

546
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:33,066
When I was a little girl...

547
00:37:33,235 --> 00:37:35,829
...I wore a ponytail, I had glasses...

548
00:37:36,005 --> 00:37:39,702
...and I was totally obsessed with the science of weather.

549
00:37:42,111 --> 00:37:44,102
Other girls wanted a Barbie.

550
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:48,148
I wanted a Doppler Weather Radar 2000 Turbo.

551
00:37:48,317 --> 00:37:51,286
But all the kids used to taunt me with this lame song.

552
00:37:51,454 --> 00:37:52,478
It wasn't even clever.

553
00:37:52,655 --> 00:37:54,589
Four-eyes, four-eyes

554
00:37:54,757 --> 00:37:56,816
You need glasses to see

555
00:37:59,729 --> 00:38:01,219
Go on.

556
00:38:02,064 --> 00:38:03,429
So I got a new look...

557
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:06,090
...gave up the science-y smart stuff...

558
00:38:06,268 --> 00:38:08,395
...and I was never made fun of again.

559
00:38:08,571 --> 00:38:12,598
And I still need these glasses, but I never wear them.

560
00:38:12,775 --> 00:38:15,266
- I'll bet you look great with glasses on. - I'm not...

561
00:38:15,444 --> 00:38:16,934
And on they go.

562
00:38:20,916 --> 00:38:21,940
- What? - Nothing.

563
00:38:22,118 --> 00:38:23,608
Wait.

564
00:38:27,656 --> 00:38:29,954
It's a Jell-O scrunchie.

565
00:38:32,995 --> 00:38:35,828
And now, the reveal.

566
00:38:39,335 --> 00:38:40,359
Wow.

567
00:38:41,604 --> 00:38:44,232
I mean, you were okay before...

568
00:38:44,407 --> 00:38:46,307
...but now...

569
00:38:46,776 --> 00:38:48,937
...you're beautiful.

570
00:38:49,111 --> 00:38:51,807
No, I'm not. I can't go out in public like this.

571
00:38:51,981 --> 00:38:54,814
Well, why not?

572
00:38:54,984 --> 00:38:58,044
I mean, this is the real you, right?

573
00:38:59,522 --> 00:39:01,080
Smart.

574
00:39:01,257 --> 00:39:03,225
Bespectacled.

575
00:39:03,826 --> 00:39:05,794
Who wouldn't wanna see that?

576
00:39:05,961 --> 00:39:10,557
You know, I've never met anyone like you, Flint Lockwood.

577
00:39:10,733 --> 00:39:12,496
Me either.

578
00:39:12,668 --> 00:39:14,795
But about you.

579
00:39:31,787 --> 00:39:33,516
Flint, you have a call

580
00:39:33,689 --> 00:39:35,589
Flint, you have a call

581
00:39:35,758 --> 00:39:37,521
Is your phone ringing?

582
00:39:37,693 --> 00:39:40,719
That's weird. Someone must've changed my ring.

583
00:39:40,896 --> 00:39:43,023
Oh, it's the mayor. Do you mind if I take this?

584
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:44,223
No, no, no.

585
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,164
- Go ahead, take it. That's fine. - I'm sorry. It's important.

586
00:39:47,336 --> 00:39:50,737
- I should be going too. It's getting late. - I'm just gonna step outside.

587
00:40:01,116 --> 00:40:03,243
Dad, you came. I have so much to tell you.

588
00:40:03,419 --> 00:40:06,445
- Do I look all right? - You look great. Come on, let's go.

589
00:40:07,823 --> 00:40:09,120
Dad, I almost kissed a girl.

590
00:40:09,291 --> 00:40:11,987
- It's Baby Brent, you know? - It was the coolest thing... Hi.

591
00:40:12,828 --> 00:40:15,661
- I should be on the list. - Hey, Brian.

592
00:40:15,831 --> 00:40:20,962
What? You're letting that guy in? That guy's a nerd.

593
00:40:23,038 --> 00:40:24,869
Hey, how's it going?

594
00:40:25,508 --> 00:40:27,942
Oh, thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you.

595
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:31,409
A toast. To Flint and his delicious steaks.

596
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:34,515
- Oh, thanks. Thank you. - Very nice place.

597
00:40:34,683 --> 00:40:36,583
Oh, wow. Thank you.

598
00:40:36,752 --> 00:40:39,653
- Flint Lockwood. - Earl.

599
00:40:45,094 --> 00:40:46,425
So no roof.

600
00:40:46,595 --> 00:40:48,893
Yep. You just hold out your plate.

601
00:40:49,064 --> 00:40:51,055
And I even made it rain your favorite:

602
00:40:51,233 --> 00:40:52,257
Meat.

603
00:40:59,675 --> 00:41:00,699
Okay.

604
00:41:01,377 --> 00:41:04,835
So you know how the grand reopening of the town is tomorrow?

605
00:41:05,014 --> 00:41:10,247
Well, the mayor has asked me to cut the ribbon.

606
00:41:10,419 --> 00:41:12,785
He said my invention saved the town.

607
00:41:13,222 --> 00:41:15,554
Aren't you proud of me?

608
00:41:23,532 --> 00:41:25,159
Well...

609
00:41:25,935 --> 00:41:28,233
...doesn't this steak look a little big to you?

610
00:41:30,339 --> 00:41:35,572
Yeah, it's a big steak. I mean, every steak is not exactly the same size.

611
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:38,235
Did you even hear what I just said?

612
00:41:39,615 --> 00:41:41,446
Son, look around.

613
00:41:41,617 --> 00:41:44,142
I'm not sure this is good for people.

614
00:41:45,721 --> 00:41:48,121
Maybe you should think about turning this thing off.

615
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:51,054
It's making everybody happy.

616
00:41:51,293 --> 00:41:53,158
Everybody except you.

617
00:41:53,829 --> 00:41:56,093
When are you gonna accept that this is who I am...

618
00:41:56,265 --> 00:42:00,361
...instead of trying to get me to work in some boring tackle shop?

619
00:42:01,971 --> 00:42:03,563
Well...

620
00:42:04,139 --> 00:42:06,607
...you seem like you know what you're doing, then.

621
00:42:08,577 --> 00:42:11,171
I guess I'll just get out of your way.

622
00:42:39,241 --> 00:42:40,469
Get with the times, man.

623
00:42:40,643 --> 00:42:43,305
I mean, there's no pleasing that guy.

624
00:42:43,479 --> 00:42:47,575
He just wants to take anything good I do and just smoosh it.

625
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:59,793
These are big hot dogs.

626
00:43:10,139 --> 00:43:11,663
Man.

627
00:43:12,274 --> 00:43:14,708
I mean, this isn't that bad.

628
00:43:14,877 --> 00:43:16,674
- Is it, Steve? - Yellow.

629
00:43:16,845 --> 00:43:17,971
You're right, Steve.

630
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:20,946
The Dangeometer is in the yellow.

631
00:43:21,116 --> 00:43:22,481
I don't know what to do.

632
00:43:22,651 --> 00:43:24,243
I do...

633
00:43:24,987 --> 00:43:27,547
...declare these hot dogs to be delicious!

634
00:43:28,657 --> 00:43:30,318
Oh, no.

635
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:32,591
How did you get in here?

636
00:43:32,761 --> 00:43:34,592
Tomorrow's the big day, Flint.

637
00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:38,531
The entire town's fate is resting on your food weather.

638
00:43:38,701 --> 00:43:39,827
I'm thinking pasta.

639
00:43:40,269 --> 00:43:44,729
Some light apps. I know you won't let us down.

640
00:43:46,842 --> 00:43:49,743
Well, Mr. Mayor, I think there's something you should see.

641
00:43:49,912 --> 00:43:51,174
What?

642
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:55,516
This is the molecular structure of a hot dog that fell last week.

643
00:43:56,085 --> 00:44:00,545
And this is the molecular structure of a hot dog that fell today.

644
00:44:00,956 --> 00:44:02,719
The machine uses microwave radiation...

645
00:44:02,891 --> 00:44:05,121
...to mutate the genetic recipe of the food.

646
00:44:05,294 --> 00:44:07,956
The more we ask it to make, the more clouds it takes in...

647
00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:12,123
...the more radiation it emits, the more these molecules could over-mutate.

648
00:44:13,135 --> 00:44:15,535
I think that's why the food is getting bigger.

649
00:44:16,572 --> 00:44:18,369
Here's what I heard:

650
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:20,735
"Science, science, science, bigger."

651
00:44:20,909 --> 00:44:22,570
And bigger is better.

652
00:44:22,745 --> 00:44:26,340
Everyone's gonna love these new portion sizes.

653
00:44:27,382 --> 00:44:28,747
I know I do.

654
00:44:31,587 --> 00:44:33,418
My dad thinks I should turn it off.

655
00:44:33,589 --> 00:44:37,821
Geniuses like us are never understood by their fathers, Flint.

656
00:44:37,993 --> 00:44:39,085
But what if things go...

657
00:44:39,261 --> 00:44:41,491
Who needs the approval of one family member...

658
00:44:41,663 --> 00:44:44,530
...when you can have it from millions of acquaintances?

659
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:48,227
Not to mention that little cutlet, Sam Sparks.

660
00:44:48,403 --> 00:44:49,961
And me.

661
00:44:50,139 --> 00:44:54,200
I've always felt that you were like a son to me, Flint.

662
00:44:54,376 --> 00:44:59,336
And I'm gonna be so proud of you tomorrow when you cut that ribbon...

663
00:44:59,515 --> 00:45:01,005
...save the town...

664
00:45:01,183 --> 00:45:05,779
...and prove to everybody what a great inventor you are.

665
00:45:05,954 --> 00:45:08,479
So here's the cheese:

666
00:45:08,657 --> 00:45:10,625
You can keep it going...

667
00:45:10,793 --> 00:45:12,761
...get everything you've ever wanted...

668
00:45:12,928 --> 00:45:16,227
...and be the great man I know you can be.

669
00:45:16,398 --> 00:45:19,162
Or you can turn it off...

670
00:45:19,334 --> 00:45:21,097
...ruin everything...

671
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:24,933
...and no one will ever like you.

672
00:45:25,607 --> 00:45:27,438
It's your choice.

673
00:45:27,609 --> 00:45:28,906
Choice.

674
00:45:29,077 --> 00:45:30,510
Choice.

675
00:45:30,679 --> 00:45:31,703
Choice.

676
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:33,177
Choice.

677
00:45:33,348 --> 00:45:35,248
Choice.

678
00:45:37,986 --> 00:45:39,010
Okay.

679
00:45:50,199 --> 00:45:52,895
I mean, bigger is better...

680
00:45:53,068 --> 00:45:54,092
...right?

681
00:45:54,269 --> 00:45:56,362
Oh, yeah.

682
00:46:00,275 --> 00:46:04,075
Spaghetti. Asparagus. Celery. Garlic bread. Meatball. Shrimp.

683
00:46:17,492 --> 00:46:19,790
- Looks safe to me. - And sanitary too.

684
00:46:53,528 --> 00:46:56,691
Who's hungry?

685
00:46:56,865 --> 00:47:01,427
Welcome, tourists, to Chew And Swallow.

686
00:47:01,603 --> 00:47:03,127
That is one big mayor.

687
00:47:03,305 --> 00:47:06,763
Delight in our nacho-cheese hot springs.

688
00:47:07,976 --> 00:47:11,002
Allow your kids to eat all the junk food they want...

689
00:47:11,179 --> 00:47:13,909
...in our completely unsupervised Kid Zone!

690
00:47:14,082 --> 00:47:16,107
I've got jellybeans for teeth.

691
00:47:16,285 --> 00:47:18,150
And when the fun is done...

692
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:22,256
...gaze upon the sunset cresting over Mount Leftovers.

693
00:47:22,424 --> 00:47:26,224
From which we're protected by a presumably indestructible dam.

694
00:47:26,662 --> 00:47:30,462
We've got people here today from all around the world...

695
00:47:30,632 --> 00:47:32,862
...from as far as China to West Virginia.

696
00:47:33,035 --> 00:47:34,900
Also I think there's some Canadians here.

697
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:37,334
- You need to look at this. - Why aren't you on TV?

698
00:47:37,506 --> 00:47:39,371
You're supposed to be broadcasting this.

699
00:47:39,541 --> 00:47:41,873
There's a problem. The food's getting bigger.

700
00:47:42,044 --> 00:47:45,013
I know, it's great. Bigger portion sizes. Everyone loves it.

701
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:47,512
I'm not sure we're doing the right thing here.

702
00:47:47,683 --> 00:47:50,083
What if we've bitten off more than we can chew?

703
00:47:50,252 --> 00:47:54,188
For the first time in my life, everybody loves something that I've done.

704
00:47:54,356 --> 00:47:56,551
Why can't you just be happy for me...

705
00:47:56,725 --> 00:47:59,250
...and go say the weather or something. Jeez.

706
00:47:59,428 --> 00:48:00,793
And without further ado...

707
00:48:00,963 --> 00:48:04,899
...our town's hero and my metaphorical son...

708
00:48:05,067 --> 00:48:07,467
...Flint Lockwood.

709
00:48:07,636 --> 00:48:08,967
Yeah, Flint.

710
00:48:09,137 --> 00:48:11,162
Thank you. Thank you, everyone.

711
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:12,967
- Sign my shrimp. - Thank you.

712
00:48:13,141 --> 00:48:15,041
- Yeah. Yeah. - I love you.

713
00:48:15,544 --> 00:48:17,705
I admire your quirkiness, dude.

714
00:48:17,879 --> 00:48:21,508
Brent, we're gonna need you to hand over the ceremonial scissors.

715
00:48:22,117 --> 00:48:23,584
But...

716
00:48:23,819 --> 00:48:24,843
No.

717
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:28,148
- You can't. You can't take them. No. - Here you go.

718
00:48:28,890 --> 00:48:31,222
I'm Baby Brent.

719
00:48:33,295 --> 00:48:36,093
Put your clothes back on.

720
00:48:36,698 --> 00:48:39,064
Who am I?

721
00:48:40,836 --> 00:48:42,963
Go ahead, Flint.

722
00:48:43,138 --> 00:48:45,538
Everybody loves you.

723
00:48:45,707 --> 00:48:48,403
Lockwood! Lockwood! Lockwood!

724
00:48:48,577 --> 00:48:51,512
Lockwood! Lockwood! Lockwood!

725
00:49:24,613 --> 00:49:27,673
Danger. Danger. Danger.

726
00:49:31,353 --> 00:49:34,049
Salt-and-pepper wind?

727
00:49:35,824 --> 00:49:37,382
Oregano.

728
00:49:53,975 --> 00:49:57,035
Sam, wait. No, I can turn it off.

729
00:50:02,384 --> 00:50:03,976
I can turn it off.

730
00:50:17,065 --> 00:50:19,590
All right, kid, it's all gonna be okay.

731
00:50:22,304 --> 00:50:24,295
Oh, no.

732
00:50:26,641 --> 00:50:29,269
- Pardon me. - Pardon me.

733
00:50:30,011 --> 00:50:32,536
- Excuse me. - No problem.

734
00:50:36,218 --> 00:50:37,845
No.

735
00:50:45,293 --> 00:50:47,625
- Gummi Bears. - Not now, Steve.

736
00:50:54,102 --> 00:50:57,071
Condiments? Salt? Pepper?

737
00:50:59,474 --> 00:51:01,169
Flint.

738
00:51:05,213 --> 00:51:07,545
This is Sam Sparks, live from Chew And Swallow...

739
00:51:07,716 --> 00:51:09,183
...where a spaghetti twister...

740
00:51:09,351 --> 00:51:13,549
Sam, hey, we love a good storm over here, but you look like a nerd.

741
00:51:13,722 --> 00:51:17,954
Patrick, several children are stranded in the path of this tomato tornado.

742
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:19,784
My tummy hurts.

743
00:51:21,663 --> 00:51:22,960
Cal.

744
00:51:24,232 --> 00:51:27,292
What is that, a scrunchie? I haven't seen one of those since 1995.

745
00:51:27,469 --> 00:51:31,098
What? We have an actual weather emergency.

746
00:51:31,273 --> 00:51:33,241
Well, we'll get right back to that storm...

747
00:51:33,408 --> 00:51:36,172
...and hopefully Sam'll look a little more appealing.

748
00:51:43,852 --> 00:51:47,413
Steve, we just have to upload the kill code and then we'll shut down the...

749
00:51:47,589 --> 00:51:48,817
What are you doing here?

750
00:51:48,990 --> 00:51:51,254
I've been ordering dinner for the last 10 minutes.

751
00:51:51,426 --> 00:51:53,860
- Is something going on? - I've gotta stop the machine.

752
00:51:54,029 --> 00:51:56,224
Everyone's in danger because of me.

753
00:51:56,398 --> 00:51:59,265
Oh, it can't be that bad.

754
00:51:59,601 --> 00:52:02,263
- No. - Well, I'm out of here.

755
00:52:02,437 --> 00:52:04,905
I can still stop the order with the kill code.

756
00:52:07,909 --> 00:52:10,605
- Sending kill code. - I'm back.

757
00:52:10,779 --> 00:52:12,838
Got to get the button.

758
00:52:14,449 --> 00:52:15,541
Play. Fun. Fun. Play.

759
00:52:15,717 --> 00:52:20,347
Hey, Flint. It's been nice to beet you.

760
00:52:21,156 --> 00:52:23,681
That's a radish.

761
00:52:45,313 --> 00:52:49,682
That was the only way to communicate with the machine.

762
00:52:50,085 --> 00:52:51,814
What exactly did you order?

763
00:52:51,987 --> 00:52:55,980
A Vegas-style all-you-can-eat buffet.

764
00:52:58,059 --> 00:53:01,551
Jellybean. Watermelon. Marshmallow. Pretzel. Sushi.

765
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:07,794
Cheeseburger. Pretzel. Egg salad. Strawberry. Marshmallow.

766
00:53:09,738 --> 00:53:10,932
Strawberry.

767
00:53:15,910 --> 00:53:18,401
- Is everyone okay? - Yeah.

768
00:53:25,086 --> 00:53:27,247
Help, somebody.

769
00:53:27,555 --> 00:53:29,489
Help me, please.

770
00:53:29,658 --> 00:53:31,421
It's my son.

771
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:33,425
We need a doctor.

772
00:53:33,595 --> 00:53:36,428
Is anyone here a doctor? Anyone?

773
00:53:36,598 --> 00:53:38,498
I am a doctor.

774
00:53:38,667 --> 00:53:39,691
You are?

775
00:53:39,868 --> 00:53:42,530
I was, back in Guatemala.

776
00:53:42,704 --> 00:53:44,638
I came here for a better life.

777
00:53:44,806 --> 00:53:46,000
Pretty great decision, eh?

778
00:53:51,179 --> 00:53:52,510
How is he, doc?

779
00:53:54,582 --> 00:53:55,879
He's in a food coma.

780
00:53:57,419 --> 00:53:58,943
Too much junk food.

781
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:00,451
I need a celery, stat.

782
00:54:00,622 --> 00:54:02,351
Here you go.

783
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:09,093
- Daddy? - Oh, Cal. Cal.

784
00:54:09,264 --> 00:54:11,732
I love you, son.

785
00:54:15,303 --> 00:54:17,362
Looks like everything turned out okay.

786
00:54:17,539 --> 00:54:18,665
Not yet, it hasn't.

787
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:22,207
That twister was an amuse-bouche compared to what's on the way.

788
00:54:22,377 --> 00:54:24,902
- What's an amuse-bouche? - Manny, patch us through.

789
00:54:31,152 --> 00:54:32,312
Go.

790
00:54:32,487 --> 00:54:35,354
Cute report, Nancy. Hey. Hey. Four-eyes.

791
00:54:35,523 --> 00:54:36,649
Can it, Patrick.

792
00:54:36,825 --> 00:54:40,158
<i>We are about to be in the epicenter of a perfect food storm.</i>

793
00:54:40,328 --> 00:54:42,489
It's going to spread across the globe.

794
00:54:42,964 --> 00:54:46,331
I've calculated the Coriolis acceleration of the storm system.

795
00:54:46,501 --> 00:54:48,560
First, it'll hit New York...

796
00:54:48,737 --> 00:54:50,762
...then Paris...

797
00:54:50,939 --> 00:54:53,840
...then the Jiayuguan Pass in eastern China.

798
00:54:54,008 --> 00:54:59,810
And in four hours the entire northern hemisphere will be one big potluck.

799
00:55:25,039 --> 00:55:26,506
Flint?

800
00:55:34,716 --> 00:55:36,047
Flint?

801
00:55:36,217 --> 00:55:37,275
Hey, Dad.

802
00:55:37,986 --> 00:55:39,578
What are you doing?

803
00:55:39,754 --> 00:55:42,416
Well, I tried to help everybody...

804
00:55:42,590 --> 00:55:46,549
...but instead I ruined everything.

805
00:55:47,128 --> 00:55:49,153
I'm just a piece of junk.

806
00:55:49,330 --> 00:55:53,266
So I threw myself away.

807
00:55:53,701 --> 00:55:57,102
Along with all these dumb inventions.

808
00:55:57,272 --> 00:55:59,137
This is junk.

809
00:55:59,874 --> 00:56:01,967
This is junk.

810
00:56:04,379 --> 00:56:05,971
This is junk.

811
00:56:06,848 --> 00:56:10,682
Oh, son. Listen, when your boat is, when it's listing...

812
00:56:10,852 --> 00:56:13,320
...and if it's not running, you know...

813
00:56:13,488 --> 00:56:15,718
Don't worry, Dad, I get it.

814
00:56:15,890 --> 00:56:18,358
Mom was wrong about me.

815
00:56:19,427 --> 00:56:21,418
I'm not an inventor.

816
00:56:22,564 --> 00:56:24,998
I should've just quit when you said.

817
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,073
Well...

818
00:56:34,976 --> 00:56:38,707
...when it rains, you put on a coat.

819
00:56:39,113 --> 00:56:43,743
Dad, you know I don't understand fishing metapho...

820
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:46,844
What?

821
00:56:50,959 --> 00:56:52,017
My coat.

822
00:57:02,537 --> 00:57:06,837
Come on, Steve. We've got diem to carpe.

823
00:57:13,581 --> 00:57:14,843
Kill code downloading.

824
00:57:17,352 --> 00:57:19,718
Redesigning. Virtualizing.

825
00:57:19,888 --> 00:57:21,480
Cutting.

826
00:57:22,156 --> 00:57:24,647
Welding. Forging.

827
00:57:24,826 --> 00:57:26,726
- Wiring. - Helping.

828
00:57:26,895 --> 00:57:28,522
Testing.

829
00:57:29,731 --> 00:57:31,665
Yes.

830
00:57:35,103 --> 00:57:37,333
Flying Car 2.

831
00:57:37,505 --> 00:57:40,201
Now with wings.

832
00:57:50,752 --> 00:57:53,778
Hey, I had a weird dream like this once.

833
00:57:54,222 --> 00:57:56,782
I have a macaroni on my head.

834
00:57:58,126 --> 00:57:59,650
Run.

835
00:58:04,999 --> 00:58:06,125
No school!

836
00:58:11,205 --> 00:58:15,369
Still nothing, nothing in the bottom of the third inning.

837
00:58:23,284 --> 00:58:24,478
Everyone.

838
00:58:26,554 --> 00:58:28,579
I want to apologize.

839
00:58:30,058 --> 00:58:32,083
Especially to you, Sam.

840
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:34,387
But I have a plan.

841
00:58:34,562 --> 00:58:36,996
This flash drive contains a kill code.

842
00:58:37,165 --> 00:58:40,498
I will fly up into that food storm, plug it into the machine...

843
00:58:40,668 --> 00:58:42,602
...and shut it down forever...

844
00:58:42,770 --> 00:58:45,136
...while you guys evacuate the island, using brea...

845
00:58:45,306 --> 00:58:47,103
This is all his fault. Get him.

846
00:58:47,275 --> 00:58:48,299
There he is! Get him!

847
00:58:48,476 --> 00:58:49,500
Get Flint.

848
00:58:49,677 --> 00:58:52,771
Let's rock his car back and forth.

849
00:58:57,652 --> 00:58:59,620
Hey!

850
00:59:00,154 --> 00:59:03,055
This mess we're in is all our faults.

851
00:59:04,525 --> 00:59:07,392
Me, I didn't even protect my own son.

852
00:59:07,562 --> 00:59:10,030
Look, I'm as mad at Flint as you are.

853
00:59:10,198 --> 00:59:14,532
In fact, when he gets out of that car, I'm gonna slap him in the face.

854
00:59:14,702 --> 00:59:18,798
I know Flint Lockwood made the food, but it was made-to-order.

855
00:59:18,973 --> 00:59:21,840
And now it's time for all of us to pay the bill.

856
00:59:32,453 --> 00:59:34,284
Thank you, Earl.

857
00:59:35,490 --> 00:59:37,151
- Sorry. - It's okay.

858
00:59:37,325 --> 00:59:41,318
- Let's go build some boats. - Yeah.

859
00:59:41,863 --> 00:59:43,660
I'm gonna go build a boat.

860
00:59:45,266 --> 00:59:46,290
I'm coming with you.

861
00:59:47,235 --> 00:59:50,568
You're gonna need someone to navigate you through that storm.

862
00:59:51,539 --> 00:59:52,972
I can't let you do this alone.

863
00:59:53,141 --> 00:59:55,871
- Oh, Sam, I'm so sorry. - Are you kidding?

864
00:59:56,044 --> 00:59:57,875
- Well, I just thought that we... - No.

865
00:59:58,046 --> 00:59:59,070
Okay.

866
00:59:59,247 --> 01:00:02,011
- You are going to need a copilot. - You're a pilot too?

867
01:00:02,450 --> 01:00:04,884
Yes. I am also a particle physicist.

868
01:00:05,053 --> 01:00:07,112
- Really? - No, that was a joke.

869
01:00:07,288 --> 01:00:08,312
I am also a comedian.

870
01:00:10,825 --> 01:00:13,692
- Let's do this thing. - I'm coming too.

871
01:00:13,861 --> 01:00:15,954
Brent, that's okay.

872
01:00:16,130 --> 01:00:19,224
No, it's not okay.

873
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:23,029
I've been coasting on my fame since I was a baby.

874
01:00:23,204 --> 01:00:26,105
But it was all just an illusion.

875
01:00:26,274 --> 01:00:30,370
Maybe up there I'll find out who I really am.

876
01:00:31,112 --> 01:00:33,740
The car's pretty full, so...

877
01:00:34,882 --> 01:00:36,315
Yeah.

878
01:00:36,484 --> 01:00:37,610
Brent.

879
01:00:37,785 --> 01:00:39,514
Okay.

880
01:00:52,066 --> 01:00:53,897
Good luck, son.

881
01:01:01,342 --> 01:01:03,742
Steve.

882
01:01:05,113 --> 01:01:06,444
Pea-soup fog.

883
01:01:06,614 --> 01:01:09,174
Manny, hit the wipers.

884
01:01:12,019 --> 01:01:15,455
There's massive gastro-precipitation accumulated around the machine.

885
01:01:16,824 --> 01:01:18,689
It's almost as if it's...

886
01:01:19,026 --> 01:01:22,325
Inside a giant meatball.

887
01:01:26,434 --> 01:01:28,561
Water goes in the top...

888
01:01:28,736 --> 01:01:32,638
...a food hurricane comes out the bottom.

889
01:01:33,074 --> 01:01:34,939
Glad I'm wearing a diaper.

890
01:01:51,659 --> 01:01:53,854
Anybody order pizza?

891
01:01:54,295 --> 01:01:56,320
Hold on.

892
01:01:56,497 --> 01:01:58,431
The pizza's chasing us?

893
01:01:58,599 --> 01:02:00,499
Sentient food? That's impossible.

894
01:02:00,668 --> 01:02:03,603
Unless its molecular structure's mutated into super food!

895
01:02:03,771 --> 01:02:07,172
That's been genetically engineered to protect the FLDSMDFR.

896
01:02:07,341 --> 01:02:09,036
Pizza.

897
01:02:09,210 --> 01:02:11,440
Pizza. Pizza. Pizza.

898
01:02:14,515 --> 01:02:18,849
That was close. I mean, can you imagine if we lost this kill code?

899
01:02:25,459 --> 01:02:26,721
- Tim's Tackle Shop. - Dad.

900
01:02:26,894 --> 01:02:28,555
You're okay, great.

901
01:02:28,729 --> 01:02:31,254
I need a favor. The fate of the world depends on it!

902
01:02:31,432 --> 01:02:33,491
Okay, then, skipper. What do you need?

903
01:02:33,668 --> 01:02:37,900
Go into my lab, get on my computer and e-mail a file to my cell phone.

904
01:02:45,479 --> 01:02:46,503
All right.

905
01:02:51,886 --> 01:02:53,877
- Want me to drive? - Yeah, okay.

906
01:03:06,801 --> 01:03:08,769
You're a lot better than me.

907
01:03:14,909 --> 01:03:16,035
Okay, here's the plan:

908
01:03:16,210 --> 01:03:19,008
Sam and I will enter the meateroid through the intake here...

909
01:03:19,180 --> 01:03:21,512
...which should lead us straight to the FLDSMDFR.

910
01:03:21,682 --> 01:03:24,412
Manny, you and Steve stay on the plane. Don't spray that.

911
01:03:24,585 --> 01:03:27,645
Once my dad e-mails me the kill code, we'll destroy the machine...

912
01:03:27,822 --> 01:03:30,120
...and rendezvous at the western blowhole in...

913
01:03:30,291 --> 01:03:32,816
- How long until the world's destroyed? - Twenty minutes.

914
01:03:32,994 --> 01:03:34,018
Just before then.

915
01:03:34,195 --> 01:03:37,028
What about me, Brent? What do I do?

916
01:03:37,598 --> 01:03:41,398
You can be president of the back seat.

917
01:03:43,204 --> 01:03:44,262
Deploy hatch.

918
01:03:44,438 --> 01:03:47,635
Car upside down, go.

919
01:03:49,076 --> 01:03:50,907
Ladies first?

920
01:03:51,379 --> 01:03:52,869
No?

921
01:03:53,047 --> 01:03:54,480
All right.

922
01:03:55,583 --> 01:03:57,710
Wait for me.

923
01:03:57,885 --> 01:03:59,910
Great. Okay, I'm good.

924
01:04:02,256 --> 01:04:06,158
As long as we stay on course, it should be a straight shot to the...

925
01:04:08,362 --> 01:04:10,091
Yeah!

926
01:04:13,467 --> 01:04:15,492
We're a team.

927
01:04:28,149 --> 01:04:30,617
We've landed here in some kind of exhaust vent.

928
01:04:30,785 --> 01:04:34,687
If we go this way, the Flamidabager should be right down this air shaft.

929
01:04:34,855 --> 01:04:36,584
Brent, get out of that pie.

930
01:04:36,757 --> 01:04:37,985
What's that?

931
01:04:51,172 --> 01:04:52,935
Oh, boy.

932
01:04:59,981 --> 01:05:02,313
Welcome, Flint.

933
01:05:11,492 --> 01:05:13,517
That's fry oil.

934
01:05:20,167 --> 01:05:21,600
Flint, you have a call.

935
01:05:21,769 --> 01:05:22,997
Flint, you have a...

936
01:05:23,170 --> 01:05:24,694
Dad. Oh, okay, great.

937
01:05:24,872 --> 01:05:27,636
On the screen there's a file marked "kill code."

938
01:05:27,808 --> 01:05:30,470
- Wha...? - Move that into my e-mail window...

939
01:05:31,445 --> 01:05:33,709
...type in my name, and press send.

940
01:05:36,183 --> 01:05:37,207
- Window? - Okay, Dad...

941
01:05:37,385 --> 01:05:40,377
...you see the thing that looks like a little piece of paper?

942
01:05:40,554 --> 01:05:42,044
Use the mouse to drag it.

943
01:05:42,256 --> 01:05:44,224
- Drag it? Drag it. - Drag it. Drag it.

944
01:05:44,425 --> 01:05:46,916
Right? Okay. Great. Okay, great.

945
01:05:47,094 --> 01:05:48,493
It's not dragging.

946
01:05:48,662 --> 01:05:50,687
Drag it across the desktop.

947
01:05:53,634 --> 01:05:56,762
- That didn't do anything. - Of course it didn't! You know what?

948
01:06:00,908 --> 01:06:01,932
Go, go, go.

949
01:06:02,109 --> 01:06:04,373
Hoist those sails. Toast that bread.

950
01:06:04,779 --> 01:06:06,576
We are running out of time.

951
01:06:10,251 --> 01:06:12,310
Let's move out. Go, go, go.

952
01:06:12,486 --> 01:06:14,317
We can do it. Come on, move it, move it.

953
01:06:14,488 --> 01:06:17,821
Good job. That's what I'm talking about. Everybody head to the docks.

954
01:06:24,765 --> 01:06:26,096
Wait, wait.

955
01:06:26,267 --> 01:06:28,735
I have an important announcement.

956
01:06:30,304 --> 01:06:31,601
See you, suckers.

957
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:33,805
Bon voyage.

958
01:06:34,675 --> 01:06:37,473
And bon app¨¦tit.

959
01:06:45,453 --> 01:06:47,887
- Cal. - Calvin.

960
01:06:57,364 --> 01:06:58,991
Cal, get back here.

961
01:07:05,339 --> 01:07:07,967
- Foodalanche. - Cal.

962
01:07:08,142 --> 01:07:09,803
I'm not gonna lose you again.

963
01:07:09,977 --> 01:07:11,706
Baby.

964
01:07:16,150 --> 01:07:18,345
Hold on tight, Calvin.

965
01:07:51,018 --> 01:07:55,045
Everybody head south. We gotta stay ahead of that storm.

966
01:07:58,125 --> 01:07:59,717
- Now what? - Just click "send."

967
01:07:59,894 --> 01:08:02,328
Flint, the Fliminadifiserser's right down there!

968
01:08:02,530 --> 01:08:05,829
- Dad, hurry. - Send. Send.

969
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,365
Oh, wait.

970
01:08:10,571 --> 01:08:12,539
Dad? Dad? Can you hear me?

971
01:08:13,107 --> 01:08:14,768
Dad?

972
01:08:15,309 --> 01:08:16,503
Hey, guys?

973
01:08:21,749 --> 01:08:24,582
Holy crap balls.

974
01:08:25,019 --> 01:08:26,782
Go, go, go.

975
01:08:33,460 --> 01:08:35,428
I don't know. I think they're kind of cute.

976
01:08:35,596 --> 01:08:37,860
I mean, this one just walked right up to me and...

977
01:08:38,032 --> 01:08:39,556
He's got me!

978
01:08:41,502 --> 01:08:43,163
- They ate Brent. - They ate Brent.

979
01:08:44,305 --> 01:08:48,241
Dad, I'm surrounded by man-eating chickens right now.

980
01:08:49,310 --> 01:08:50,607
So if this is goodbye...

981
01:08:52,046 --> 01:08:54,412
...thanks for trying to set me straight.

982
01:08:54,949 --> 01:08:57,543
Figured it out a little late, I guess.

983
01:08:58,552 --> 01:09:00,144
Okay, bye.

984
01:09:18,339 --> 01:09:19,931
Dad.

985
01:09:21,642 --> 01:09:24,372
Hey, give me that phone back.

986
01:09:42,529 --> 01:09:43,723
Baby Brent?

987
01:09:43,897 --> 01:09:46,923
I'm not Baby Brent anymore.

988
01:09:47,101 --> 01:09:49,899
I'm Chicken Brent.

989
01:09:50,070 --> 01:09:54,006
And I'm finally contributing to society.

990
01:09:54,174 --> 01:09:56,005
Crotch kick.

991
01:10:02,082 --> 01:10:06,314
Now go, you crazy kids, and save the world.

992
01:10:06,487 --> 01:10:09,149
You did it, Chicken Brent. You really did it.

993
01:10:09,323 --> 01:10:11,291
Go, go, go.

994
01:10:13,460 --> 01:10:15,451
It should be right down this hole.

995
01:10:17,931 --> 01:10:18,955
That's peanut brittle.

996
01:10:20,768 --> 01:10:24,204
If either one of us touches it, we'll go into anaphylactic shock.

997
01:10:24,672 --> 01:10:27,106
Actually, I'm not entirely allergic to peanuts.

998
01:10:27,274 --> 01:10:30,971
I might have just said that to get you to like me.

999
01:10:31,145 --> 01:10:35,309
So you really thought having allergies would make you more attractive?

1000
01:10:38,852 --> 01:10:40,717
Mustache.

1001
01:10:40,888 --> 01:10:42,515
Mus...

1002
01:10:50,964 --> 01:10:53,455
- Sesame bagel. - Hey, taxi.

1003
01:10:53,634 --> 01:10:55,465
- Taxi. - Taxi.

1004
01:10:55,636 --> 01:10:58,298
I asked for extra mustard.

1005
01:11:04,278 --> 01:11:06,746
I was right.

1006
01:11:16,090 --> 01:11:17,318
Hot tea?

1007
01:11:17,491 --> 01:11:19,516
Did he say hot tea?

1008
01:11:20,828 --> 01:11:24,457
"You are about to be crushed by a giant corn."

1009
01:11:24,631 --> 01:11:26,292
Run.

1010
01:11:28,435 --> 01:11:31,336
It looks like the food storm is following an unusual pattern...

1011
01:11:31,505 --> 01:11:33,837
...of hitting the world's famous landmarks first...

1012
01:11:34,007 --> 01:11:37,135
...and is now spreading to the rest of the globe.

1013
01:11:38,779 --> 01:11:39,871
What the what?

1014
01:11:40,047 --> 01:11:42,572
Hurry up, guys.

1015
01:11:42,783 --> 01:11:45,581
After I plug my phone into the FLDSMDFR and destroy it...

1016
01:11:45,753 --> 01:11:49,519
...l'll tug on the licorice twice and you'll pull me back up, okay?

1017
01:11:49,923 --> 01:11:51,618
Sounds great.

1018
01:12:02,102 --> 01:12:03,364
Oh, no.

1019
01:12:08,409 --> 01:12:09,774
You got cut, didn't you?

1020
01:12:11,145 --> 01:12:12,908
It's just a scratch.

1021
01:12:14,081 --> 01:12:17,778
Brent, you need to take Sam back to the plane to get her an allergy shot.

1022
01:12:17,951 --> 01:12:19,111
Just a second.

1023
01:12:19,286 --> 01:12:20,548
What? No.

1024
01:12:21,021 --> 01:12:24,081
- Let go, Sam. - I'm not gonna let you go.

1025
01:12:24,258 --> 01:12:27,125
Flint, you'll be stuck down there.

1026
01:12:27,294 --> 01:12:29,455
It's not ideal, no.

1027
01:12:30,063 --> 01:12:32,463
Come with us. We'll start over.

1028
01:12:32,633 --> 01:12:36,069
We'll live underground. Use bacon for clothes.

1029
01:12:36,236 --> 01:12:37,999
Sam, that's not a very good plan.

1030
01:12:38,172 --> 01:12:40,800
It is if it means I don't have to lose you.

1031
01:12:41,575 --> 01:12:43,907
Look, I like you, okay?

1032
01:12:45,379 --> 01:12:48,109
Like... Like, as a friend?

1033
01:12:48,282 --> 01:12:50,079
No.

1034
01:12:50,284 --> 01:12:52,946
Like, "like you" like you.

1035
01:12:55,656 --> 01:12:57,351
Me too.

1036
01:12:59,026 --> 01:13:01,017
But about you.

1037
01:13:06,433 --> 01:13:07,491
Goodbye, Sam.

1038
01:13:07,668 --> 01:13:10,193
Flint. No.

1039
01:13:10,370 --> 01:13:11,632
Hang on, Sam.

1040
01:13:11,805 --> 01:13:14,706
Dr. Manny's got the medicine for your face.

1041
01:13:20,180 --> 01:13:21,841
Pickles.

1042
01:13:23,317 --> 01:13:24,511
Beets.

1043
01:13:24,685 --> 01:13:27,085
Banana.

1044
01:13:27,254 --> 01:13:29,950
Strawberry.

1045
01:13:41,235 --> 01:13:44,204
- Manny, we're on our way. Hurry. - Hang on, Sam.

1046
01:13:44,371 --> 01:13:46,737
I'm circling the blowhole.

1047
01:13:50,644 --> 01:13:51,668
Scared.

1048
01:14:02,823 --> 01:14:03,847
Gummi Bears.

1049
01:14:04,024 --> 01:14:06,515
Play with us, play with us. Eat us, eat us.

1050
01:14:07,661 --> 01:14:09,026
Hungry.

1051
01:14:09,796 --> 01:14:12,993
Hungry. Gummi Bears. Gummi Bears. Gummi Bears. Steve hungry. Hungry.

1052
01:14:13,166 --> 01:14:15,225
<i>Steve starving. Hungry. Hungry. Starving.</i>

1053
01:14:21,942 --> 01:14:24,103
Manny. Where are you?

1054
01:14:48,001 --> 01:14:50,128
- She touched a peanut or something. - Oh, boy.

1055
01:15:00,380 --> 01:15:01,938
Corn.

1056
01:15:36,550 --> 01:15:37,574
Grabbing.

1057
01:15:38,118 --> 01:15:40,086
Tying. Throwing.

1058
01:15:43,056 --> 01:15:44,853
Waiting.

1059
01:15:46,927 --> 01:15:47,951
Swinging.

1060
01:15:57,170 --> 01:16:00,037
Sorry, old friend. The kitchen's closed.

1061
01:16:04,745 --> 01:16:05,769
Fight the power!

1062
01:16:06,179 --> 01:16:07,271
Dad.

1063
01:16:07,447 --> 01:16:08,641
No.

1064
01:16:49,656 --> 01:16:54,025
When it rains, you put on a coat...

1065
01:16:54,194 --> 01:16:56,219
...of Spray-On Shoes.

1066
01:16:58,565 --> 01:17:01,227
Yeah.

1067
01:17:16,083 --> 01:17:18,745
Just... There were chickens...

1068
01:17:18,919 --> 01:17:20,011
Where's Flint?

1069
01:17:23,690 --> 01:17:25,317
No!

1070
01:17:25,959 --> 01:17:27,654
I know, kid.

1071
01:17:27,828 --> 01:17:29,090
I know.

1072
01:17:38,305 --> 01:17:40,569
- Cool. - Yeah. All right.

1073
01:18:18,345 --> 01:18:19,676
Flint?

1074
01:18:22,849 --> 01:18:24,248
I'm sorry.

1075
01:18:42,669 --> 01:18:45,399
Your son was a great man.

1076
01:19:10,630 --> 01:19:13,394
- Steve. - Steve.

1077
01:19:13,567 --> 01:19:15,228
- Flint. - Brent.

1078
01:19:15,402 --> 01:19:16,960
- Flint. - Cal.

1079
01:19:17,137 --> 01:19:18,229
- Steve. - Flint.

1080
01:19:18,405 --> 01:19:19,633
- Earl. - Flint.

1081
01:19:19,806 --> 01:19:22,138
- You guy. - Steve.

1082
01:19:24,511 --> 01:19:25,739
Sam.

1083
01:19:25,912 --> 01:19:27,072
Flint.

1084
01:19:28,048 --> 01:19:29,140
Sam.

1085
01:19:29,316 --> 01:19:31,011
- Flint. - Flint.

1086
01:19:31,184 --> 01:19:32,515
- Dad. - Steve.

1087
01:19:32,686 --> 01:19:34,483
Flint.

1088
01:19:38,325 --> 01:19:42,284
Look, when you... When you cast your line...

1089
01:19:42,462 --> 01:19:46,262
...if it's not straight...

1090
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,195
Oh, for crying out loud.

1091
01:19:53,039 --> 01:19:54,904
I'm proud of you, Flint.

1092
01:19:55,475 --> 01:19:58,103
I'm amazed that someone as ordinary as me...

1093
01:19:58,278 --> 01:20:02,339
...could be the father of someone as extraordinary as you.

1094
01:20:02,515 --> 01:20:05,814
You're talented, you're a total original.

1095
01:20:05,986 --> 01:20:08,819
And your lab is breathtaking.

1096
01:20:08,989 --> 01:20:11,981
Your mom, she always knew you were going to be special.

1097
01:20:12,158 --> 01:20:15,252
And if she were alive today, she'd tell us both:

1098
01:20:15,428 --> 01:20:17,589
"I told you so."

1099
01:20:18,531 --> 01:20:21,625
Now, look, when I take this thing off...

1100
01:20:21,801 --> 01:20:25,259
...and you hear me make a fishing metaphor...

1101
01:20:26,039 --> 01:20:28,940
...just know that fishing metaphor means:

1102
01:20:29,109 --> 01:20:30,940
I love my son.

1103
01:20:31,111 --> 01:20:33,409
I love you too, Dad.

1104
01:20:44,491 --> 01:20:46,356
So where were we?

1105
01:20:46,526 --> 01:20:48,323
You were about to kiss me.

1106
01:20:48,495 --> 01:20:50,520
Were you gonna kiss me back?

1107
01:20:50,697 --> 01:20:52,187
Why don't you find out?

1108
01:20:52,365 --> 01:20:55,266
Because I don't want to go for it and then get shut down again.

1109
01:20:55,435 --> 01:20:57,198
- Just kiss me. - You know...

1110
01:21:07,147 --> 01:21:10,344
Yeah. I'm a chicken.

1111
01:21:28,301 --> 01:21:32,101
This was not well thought out.
