2
00:00:47,946 --> 00:00:51,033
<i>There is a place.</i>

3
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,453
<i>A place that knows no sadness.</i>

4
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:59,375
<i>Where even feeling blue is a happy thing.</i>

5
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:06,131
<i>A place inhabited by little blue beings</i>
<i>three apples high.</i>

6
00:01:06,882 --> 00:01:12,971
<i>It lies deep in an enchanted forest,</i>
<i>hidden away beyond a medieval village.</i>

7
00:01:13,055 --> 00:01:16,141
<i>Most people believe this place is made up,</i>

8
00:01:16,225 --> 00:01:20,771
<i>only to be found in books</i>
<i>or in children's imaginations.</i>

9
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:23,816
<i>Well, we beg to differ.</i>

10
00:01:24,858 --> 00:01:27,528
Yeah! Come on, Farmer!

11
00:01:30,531 --> 00:01:32,741
I'm going in!

12
00:01:34,368 --> 00:01:37,371
All right, Greedy, I'm gonna race you!

13
00:01:37,538 --> 00:01:38,997
Yes!

14
00:01:40,332 --> 00:01:47,047
Whoa, golly! Farm boys love to fly!

15
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,634
Oh, yeah! So excited!

16
00:01:58,267 --> 00:02:01,770
Now you see us, now you don't!

17
00:02:01,895 --> 00:02:05,232
Three, two, one. Yeah!

18
00:02:19,913 --> 00:02:23,959
Yeah! I love smurfberries! Hey, hey!
The blue ones are mine!

19
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,474
Oh, no! I'm late for rehearsal! I am so late!

20
00:02:38,557 --> 00:02:43,645
<i>In Smurf village, each and every Smurf</i>
<i>plays their own special part.</i>

21
00:02:44,146 --> 00:02:46,190
- Whoa, Nellie!
- Sorry, Handy!

22
00:02:46,273 --> 00:02:49,401
No problem, Clumsy. You keep me employed!

23
00:02:49,485 --> 00:02:51,862
<i>Which gives the Smurfs a sense of harmony.</i>

24
00:02:51,945 --> 00:02:54,239
- Hey, Baker! Nice pies!
- No worries, Clumsy.

25
00:02:54,323 --> 00:02:56,784
<i>- And tranquillity.</i>
- Great sign, guys!

26
00:02:56,867 --> 00:02:59,370
<i>- Whether it's Handy Smurf, the builder.</i>
- I can't stay. Rehearsal time!

27
00:02:59,453 --> 00:03:01,872
- Baker Smurf.
- Hey, Narrator Smurf!

28
00:03:01,955 --> 00:03:05,876
Hello, Clumsy! Just rehearsing the intro
for the Blue Moon Festival!

29
00:03:06,168 --> 00:03:08,462
- Pizza!
- Pardon me! Pardon me! Hey, Chef Smurf!

30
00:03:08,545 --> 00:03:11,215
Clumsy! Help!

31
00:03:12,549 --> 00:03:16,595
I just invented frozen pizzas! Genius!

32
00:03:17,596 --> 00:03:18,931
Smurf on the loose!

33
00:03:19,014 --> 00:03:20,307
- Hey, Clumsy.
- Hey, guys!

34
00:03:20,391 --> 00:03:22,017
- Hi, Jokey!
- Hi, Clumsy.

35
00:03:23,268 --> 00:03:24,853
Who's clumsy now, huh?

36
00:03:24,937 --> 00:03:27,856
Hey, what do you get when you cross
a Smurf with a cow?

37
00:03:28,315 --> 00:03:31,777
Blue cheese! I got you a present.

38
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,196
No, thanks, Jokey. I'm late for rehearsal!

39
00:03:34,279 --> 00:03:36,198
But, wait! I...

40
00:03:40,285 --> 00:03:41,870
Hey, Grouchy. Hey, Gutsy.

41
00:03:41,954 --> 00:03:43,872
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow your roll, sailor.

42
00:03:43,956 --> 00:03:46,542
Hey, wait, wait. Isn't that the rehearsal
for the Blue Moon Festival?

43
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:49,086
What can I say, Clumsy?
You're not on the list.

44
00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:50,879
Grouchy, it's right there.

45
00:03:51,004 --> 00:03:54,550
Right. Under "Do not let in Clumsy."

46
00:03:54,675 --> 00:03:57,052
Clearly you two
lack the verbal skills required

47
00:03:57,136 --> 00:03:59,179
- to explain this predicament succinctly.
- Hey!

48
00:03:59,304 --> 00:04:00,889
- Here we go.
- You see, Clumsy,

49
00:04:00,973 --> 00:04:04,643
the other Smurfs don't want to dance
with you for fear of what are politely called

50
00:04:04,893 --> 00:04:06,645
"fractures."

51
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:10,441
How could anybody think that?

52
00:04:11,066 --> 00:04:12,860
That's gonna leave a big blue bruise.

53
00:04:14,903 --> 00:04:19,366
Wonderful! Beautiful! Marvellous.

54
00:04:20,242 --> 00:04:22,202
Watch it, there!

55
00:04:23,537 --> 00:04:28,042
Cut! Cut! Cut! It's a dance, not dominoes.

56
00:04:28,917 --> 00:04:32,254
- A worry line!
- All right, don't get your petals in a twist.

57
00:04:32,337 --> 00:04:36,216
As happy and as perfect
as life in Smurf village is,

58
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:41,305
even sunshine and butterflies
must have their dark clouds.

59
00:04:41,388 --> 00:04:45,851
And for all Smurfs,
that dark cloud has one name.

60
00:04:45,934 --> 00:04:49,104
Gargamel, the evil wizard.

61
00:04:49,646 --> 00:04:53,359
<i>La la la la la la</i>
<i>Sing a happy song</i>

62
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:57,696
<i>La la la la la la</i>
<i>This is so wrong</i>

63
00:04:57,988 --> 00:04:59,782
"I'm Papa Smurf.

64
00:04:59,865 --> 00:05:02,534
"I'm the head of a small group of blue people

65
00:05:02,618 --> 00:05:06,997
"and live in the forest
with 99 sons and one daughter.

66
00:05:07,664 --> 00:05:11,293
"Nothing weird about that, no, no.
Totally normal."

67
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:15,005
"Oh, and I'm Smurfette.
And I think I'm so pretty.

68
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:17,883
"And I betrayed Gargamel,
and I don't even care.

69
00:05:17,966 --> 00:05:20,719
"And everything is just
sunshine and rainbows."

70
00:05:24,765 --> 00:05:27,601
But all of that is about to change.

71
00:05:33,649 --> 00:05:38,362
I said, "All of that is about to change."
Azrael, that's your cue!

72
00:05:38,445 --> 00:05:40,572
That's your cue to
pounce on the miserable beasts

73
00:05:40,656 --> 00:05:43,659
in some kind of a rage-induced feline frenzy.

74
00:05:43,742 --> 00:05:45,244
Yes, good. Yeah. More rage.

75
00:05:45,327 --> 00:05:48,122
Hey, but don't go crazy.
These are the only puppets I have.

76
00:05:50,082 --> 00:05:52,751
I am not obsessed with Smurfs, thank you.

77
00:05:52,835 --> 00:05:55,587
I simply can't stop thinking about
the miserable beasts

78
00:05:55,671 --> 00:05:57,965
every single minute of every single day.

79
00:05:58,716 --> 00:06:00,217
'Cause I need them!

80
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,430
It is only by capturing the little wretches
and extracting their happy blue essence

81
00:06:04,513 --> 00:06:08,100
that my magic will finally become...

82
00:06:09,309 --> 00:06:10,477
Not infallible.

83
00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:14,356
Invincible! Yes. Thank you.

84
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:19,194
I shall become the most powerful wizard
in all of the world.

85
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,331
Yeah, but you're milking it. Don't milk it.

86
00:06:31,415 --> 00:06:32,624
"O great one?"

87
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:35,878
Yes, lying, deceptive,
horrible little Smurfette?

88
00:06:36,045 --> 00:06:40,507
"After all your years of Smurf-less searching,
how ever do you expect to find us?"

89
00:06:40,841 --> 00:06:43,343
I'm very glad you asked, my dear.

90
00:06:43,427 --> 00:06:46,013
For, you see, I have a magical map

91
00:06:46,096 --> 00:06:48,724
that shows me exactly where
the smurfroot grows!

92
00:06:48,807 --> 00:06:53,562
I shall now use my formidable powers
to magically transport us here!

93
00:06:55,105 --> 00:06:57,524
Come, my little fish-breathed friend!

94
00:06:57,775 --> 00:06:59,318
Alakazoop!

95
00:07:02,363 --> 00:07:03,781
Great.

96
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:07,910
Ye gods, Azrael. You're a boy?

97
00:07:09,286 --> 00:07:11,872
We really need that Smurf essence.

98
00:07:11,955 --> 00:07:13,290
Alakazamp!

99
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:18,962
Now tie it off right there!

100
00:07:19,046 --> 00:07:22,633
That blue moon time of year again.

101
00:07:23,092 --> 00:07:25,135
Time to smurf some magic.

102
00:07:25,219 --> 00:07:28,889
Summon a vision
and see what our future holds.

103
00:07:28,972 --> 00:07:32,184
I must get the visioning potion just right.

104
00:07:32,267 --> 00:07:35,229
The magic is always strongest
during the blue moon.

105
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:40,401
So far, so good.
Lots of smiles and smurfberries.

106
00:07:40,484 --> 00:07:43,821
Clumsy's sitting still. That's always good.

107
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:47,449
A dragon wand.

108
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:50,828
<i>I got it! I got it!</i>

109
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:52,913
Clumsy.

110
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:58,836
- Help! Save us!
- Papa!

111
00:08:02,589 --> 00:08:04,007
Papa!

112
00:08:04,675 --> 00:08:07,720
Clumsy, what have you done?

113
00:08:07,803 --> 00:08:10,764
- Hey, Papa.
- Clumsy?

114
00:08:11,223 --> 00:08:12,433
Are you okay?

115
00:08:12,641 --> 00:08:15,561
Yes. Fine.

116
00:08:15,644 --> 00:08:18,147
Why aren't you rehearsing for
the Blue Moon celebration?

117
00:08:18,522 --> 00:08:21,191
You know.
A couple guys got smacked in the face,

118
00:08:21,275 --> 00:08:23,569
so I thought I'd make
some smurfroot mud packs

119
00:08:23,652 --> 00:08:26,864
to take down everyone's swelling.

120
00:08:27,906 --> 00:08:30,868
Papa, you're smurf out of smurfroot.
I'll go pick some.

121
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,663
No! Those fields are too close
to Gargamel's castle.

122
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:36,165
I'll get the smurfroot.

123
00:08:36,248 --> 00:08:39,418
You stay in the village and out of trouble.
Do you understand?

124
00:08:39,501 --> 00:08:43,130
Okay. If you say so.

125
00:08:43,714 --> 00:08:49,136
A vision's never been wrong.
I can't let this happen to my Smurfs.

126
00:08:51,638 --> 00:08:54,224
"Just stay in the village, Clumsy."

127
00:08:54,308 --> 00:08:58,729
Look at all this smurfroot.
They are gonna be so proud of me.

128
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:01,815
Let's see, just a few more...

129
00:09:05,486 --> 00:09:07,237
- Boo.
- Gargamel!

130
00:09:10,532 --> 00:09:11,825
Help!

131
00:09:12,368 --> 00:09:14,661
Good kitty. Good kitty. Look! Look!

132
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,205
A ball of yarn!

133
00:09:16,288 --> 00:09:18,290
A nice, juicy bird!

134
00:09:22,044 --> 00:09:23,837
So, that's it!

135
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:27,174
It's invisible.

136
00:09:28,008 --> 00:09:30,386
Those sneaky... Wait, wait, wait, wait.

137
00:09:31,303 --> 00:09:33,555
We don't know if it's safe.

138
00:09:38,894 --> 00:09:40,354
Azrael?

139
00:09:42,064 --> 00:09:44,358
Are you dead?

140
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:48,612
So, what did you see in your vision, Papa?

141
00:09:48,696 --> 00:09:52,491
Nothing apocalyptic, really.

142
00:09:52,574 --> 00:09:54,243
Everything's going to be just fine.

143
00:09:54,576 --> 00:09:57,996
Perfect. Another year we don't have to
worry about that mean, old...

144
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,874
- Gargamel!
- I know who she meant, Clumsy.

145
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:04,211
No, no! Gargamel!

146
00:10:05,087 --> 00:10:07,464
I mighta, kinda, sorta
accidentally led him to the village.

147
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:10,467
Gargamel!

148
00:10:11,552 --> 00:10:13,345
Smurf for your lives!

149
00:10:13,429 --> 00:10:15,389
Everybody skedaddle!

150
00:10:18,142 --> 00:10:19,893
- Into the forest, Smurfs!
- Come on, Clumsy!

151
00:10:19,977 --> 00:10:22,229
Sound the alarm, Crazy.

152
00:10:22,312 --> 00:10:24,273
This is really bad!

153
00:10:24,356 --> 00:10:25,691
Smurfs, that way!

154
00:10:26,275 --> 00:10:28,777
Hey, cat! Azrael, over here! Come on!

155
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,948
There you go, you nasty cat.

156
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:35,242
- This way!
- This is no joke!

157
00:10:35,325 --> 00:10:36,994
- Look out!
- Papa!

158
00:10:49,673 --> 00:10:51,967
Let go! Cursed nature!

159
00:10:57,431 --> 00:10:59,975
Here comes papa, Papa!

160
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:08,525
Papa, your primitive little defences,
they're useless against me, sir!

161
00:11:09,318 --> 00:11:10,903
I laugh at them.

162
00:11:20,412 --> 00:11:22,831
How's that for primitive, Gargamel?

163
00:11:23,499 --> 00:11:24,792
Maybe this will all blow over.

164
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:27,294
I can fix this. I just gotta think.

165
00:11:27,503 --> 00:11:28,587
Yes!

166
00:11:28,796 --> 00:11:30,255
Follow me, everyone!

167
00:11:32,674 --> 00:11:34,468
Save yourselves!

168
00:11:34,885 --> 00:11:37,388
Clumsy! You're going the wrong way!

169
00:11:37,471 --> 00:11:39,973
- He's headed for the Forbidden Falls!
- With the blue moon coming?

170
00:11:40,057 --> 00:11:42,726
- Quickly, Smurfs! Stop him!
- Unbelievable!

171
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:45,687
The one time we want him to trip
and he's running perfectly!

172
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:47,356
- Clumsy!
- Oh, this is a predicament.

173
00:11:47,439 --> 00:11:50,109
"Agony ahead"!
Anybody reading these signs?

174
00:11:50,192 --> 00:11:52,653
- This is a predicament!
- This guy's killing me!

175
00:11:52,736 --> 00:11:54,655
Looks like we're down to 99 Smurfs!

176
00:11:54,738 --> 00:11:56,281
This is not good at all.

177
00:12:01,453 --> 00:12:02,830
Clumsy!

178
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,791
Help!

179
00:12:05,874 --> 00:12:07,292
Well, we tried. Let's go.

180
00:12:07,376 --> 00:12:10,337
Hold on, lad!
We'll form a Smurf bridge to get you.

181
00:12:10,421 --> 00:12:11,922
Not the Smurf bridge!

182
00:12:12,589 --> 00:12:14,466
- There we go.
- Yeah, pardon me.

183
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:17,219
This is not a Smurf bridge,
it's clearly a chain...

184
00:12:17,302 --> 00:12:19,179
- Smurf it, Brainy!
- Smurf it, Brainy!

185
00:12:19,596 --> 00:12:21,682
- The blue moon!
- Oh, dear.

186
00:12:21,765 --> 00:12:24,435
- What's happening, Papa?
- What the blinking flip is that?

187
00:12:24,518 --> 00:12:25,769
Oh, no!

188
00:12:25,853 --> 00:12:28,313
- The vision!
- Come on, guys!

189
00:12:28,397 --> 00:12:30,482
- Pull him up!
- Hurry!

190
00:12:32,234 --> 00:12:35,279
- Don't let go!
- Help!

191
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:36,697
Help!

192
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:38,699
Look out for the hole!

193
00:12:38,782 --> 00:12:41,577
No, it's more of a vortex. Or a portal.

194
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,454
Smurf up! It's a hole.

195
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:47,833
Hold on!

196
00:12:49,043 --> 00:12:50,377
Oh, no!

197
00:12:50,461 --> 00:12:54,089
Looks like you got
the short end of the stick, eh, Papa?

198
00:12:54,381 --> 00:12:57,301
Now you belong to me!

199
00:12:57,801 --> 00:13:00,137
Not this time, Gargamel!

200
00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:22,076
What's wrong with you?

201
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:26,205
That was great! Let's have another go.

202
00:13:26,288 --> 00:13:29,083
Are you smurfed? We almost died in there!

203
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:30,459
We're not even wet.

204
00:13:30,542 --> 00:13:33,379
What part of the enchanted forest is this?

205
00:13:33,462 --> 00:13:35,381
My calculations indicate...

206
00:13:36,465 --> 00:13:37,508
That's slimy.

207
00:13:38,133 --> 00:13:40,803
I don't think we're in Smurf village any more.

208
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:42,221
Oh, my.

209
00:13:44,598 --> 00:13:48,060
- Smurfs? You may want to take a look at this.
- What is it?

210
00:13:48,477 --> 00:13:52,189
Why are we listening to him?
He just got us sucked through a giant hole.

211
00:13:52,272 --> 00:13:53,649
It's not a hole, it's a vortex.

212
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:56,819
And can't we just go around the rock?

213
00:14:01,115 --> 00:14:04,702
Oh, my smurf.

214
00:14:05,035 --> 00:14:06,620
Where the smurf are we?

215
00:14:06,704 --> 00:14:10,749
Up the smurfing creek without a paddle,
that's where.

216
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,751
Well, at least they're not coming after us.

217
00:14:13,544 --> 00:14:15,254
Oh, yeah. Really?

218
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,173
- Oh, dear.
- Azrael!

219
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:19,550
- Run!
- Not again!

220
00:14:19,967 --> 00:14:23,637
Azrael? Are you dead?

221
00:14:29,059 --> 00:14:32,938
Must have Smurfs!

222
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:39,570
- We'll circle back when it's safe!
- Run!

223
00:14:39,653 --> 00:14:41,363
- Guys, come on!
- Go!

224
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:43,323
- Coming through!
- I'm getting hungry!

225
00:14:43,407 --> 00:14:45,909
Hey, how are you? Yeah, nice to see you.
Enjoy the party.

226
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:47,703
Hey, can we get
the photographer over there?

227
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:50,873
There's big arrivals happening.
Thanks. Welcome.

228
00:14:51,707 --> 00:14:54,918
Hey, ladies, looking good.
A couple quick, quick tips.

229
00:14:55,002 --> 00:14:56,962
If you could not stand
directly in front of the display,

230
00:14:57,046 --> 00:15:00,340
but over to the sides,
it'd be a bit more visible. Hey, look, product.

231
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:01,592
Also, don't forget to smile.

232
00:15:01,884 --> 00:15:04,887
Remember, you're working for
a cosmetics company. That's it.

233
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,056
- Smile, relax, everyone will have a good time.
- Let's go!

234
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:09,808
- Thanks. Thank you so much.
- Hurry!

235
00:15:09,892 --> 00:15:11,393
Hello, Henri.

236
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:13,228
On top of everything
with the campaign, Patrick?

237
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:14,396
Well, as much as I can be.

238
00:15:14,605 --> 00:15:16,982
We certainly did our homework.
We tested the results.

239
00:15:17,066 --> 00:15:18,609
Patrick!

240
00:15:21,445 --> 00:15:24,031
- She's pointing at me.
- That can't be good.

241
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,452
Odile, it looks fantastic for
Thursday's launch.

242
00:15:28,619 --> 00:15:30,496
It's gonna be quite the gala.

243
00:15:30,579 --> 00:15:35,292
There he is.
My new vice president of marketing.

244
00:15:35,626 --> 00:15:38,003
- So, wait, you fired Ralph?
- His campaign was rubbish.

245
00:15:38,087 --> 00:15:41,382
He gave me what I asked for, not what I want.

246
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:43,675
Can you give me what I want?

247
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,260
Is that what you're asking for?

248
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:48,597
How would I know what I'm asking for
when I don't even know what I want?

249
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,725
Well said, Odile. Well said.
That's why you need me.

250
00:15:51,809 --> 00:15:55,479
Exacto! I need you to create
a new campaign for Jouvenel.

251
00:15:55,562 --> 00:15:59,316
All digital, of course,
so it can be ready on time for the launch.

252
00:16:00,567 --> 00:16:02,111
Odile, that's two days.

253
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:05,823
<i>Si, mi corazón,</i> and it mustn't be delayed.
Is that going to be a problem?

254
00:16:05,906 --> 00:16:08,575
No. No, I mean for a whole new campaign,
it's kind of tight.

255
00:16:08,659 --> 00:16:10,536
But... No, two days is perfect.

256
00:16:10,619 --> 00:16:12,329
God only needed six days
for the whole world, right?

257
00:16:12,579 --> 00:16:15,833
Fail me, and maybe you can
go and work for him.

258
00:16:21,505 --> 00:16:23,882
Where are we, Azrael?

259
00:16:26,468 --> 00:16:29,722
What manner of freakish realm is this?

260
00:16:32,641 --> 00:16:35,185
Okay, one more box of research.
Hey, would you get a cab for me, please?

261
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:37,020
Yes, yes, of course.

262
00:16:37,104 --> 00:16:39,022
This day just keeps getting better and better.

263
00:16:39,106 --> 00:16:42,067
So we're just gonna jump in the portal,
get back to our village

264
00:16:42,151 --> 00:16:43,485
and everybody's happy, right?

265
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,779
Yeah, guys. Let's stay smurftimistic.

266
00:16:45,863 --> 00:16:48,115
You know what?
I choose to be pessismurfstic.

267
00:16:48,198 --> 00:16:49,450
We're all gonna die.

268
00:16:49,533 --> 00:16:52,911
Papa Smurf, how do we get home
with the portal closed?

269
00:16:52,995 --> 00:16:55,622
I'm sure when the blue moon rises tonight,

270
00:16:55,706 --> 00:16:57,499
the portal will open again.

271
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,460
Now, let's take shelter till dark.

272
00:16:59,668 --> 00:17:01,295
All right, let's get smurfing.

273
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,464
Okay, but I'm not happy.

274
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:05,549
- Azrael!
- Run, Smurfs!

275
00:17:05,632 --> 00:17:06,925
- Take that!
- Guys, come on!

276
00:17:07,009 --> 00:17:09,470
- Quick, to the tree!
- Let's go!

277
00:17:11,889 --> 00:17:14,475
- Smurfette!
- My hair! Get back, cat!

278
00:17:17,478 --> 00:17:18,645
Way to go, Smurfette!

279
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:22,524
- Oh, no!
- Take one for the team, Clumsy!

280
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:24,026
- Help!
- Clumsy, look out!

281
00:17:24,151 --> 00:17:25,527
Smurf!

282
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:29,740
- Clumsy!
- Oh, no!

283
00:17:30,324 --> 00:17:31,825
Hey.

284
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:34,578
- Clumsy!
- What a numptie.

285
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:37,247
- Quickly, to the mechanical wagon.
- Up the tree, Smurfs.

286
00:17:37,331 --> 00:17:39,208
Why don't we just go around the tree?

287
00:17:40,667 --> 00:17:42,211
There you are. By all means,

288
00:17:42,336 --> 00:17:45,964
relax here in the fresh air and the sunshine
while my missing Smurfs could be anywhere.

289
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:48,759
What? Where?

290
00:17:48,842 --> 00:17:50,386
Come on! Try and stay with me, Smurfs.

291
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:52,763
- I'm getting too old for this.
- Slow down!

292
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,306
Be careful, Brainy.

293
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,350
Hey. Hey!

294
00:17:56,433 --> 00:17:58,394
Seventh Street, from First and A, please.

295
00:17:58,852 --> 00:18:00,187
- Come on, Smurfs!
- I don't like these heights.

296
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,564
- Don't look down.
- Come back here, wretched Smurfs!

297
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:03,982
- Hurry!
- We're way up here!

298
00:18:04,066 --> 00:18:06,819
A jump from this height
will knock the blue out of us!

299
00:18:06,902 --> 00:18:08,320
- My hip.
- Papa!

300
00:18:08,404 --> 00:18:09,613
- Gargamel!
- Oh, dear.

301
00:18:09,697 --> 00:18:11,073
- Stop that carriage!
- Let's go! Let's go!

302
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:13,242
- Wait, wait. I forgot my phone.
- Come back! Stop there!

303
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:15,786
Stop that carriage!

304
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,246
Never mind. Here it is.

305
00:18:17,955 --> 00:18:19,373
Knock yourself out, Gargamel!

306
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,667
You've had that coming for about 30 years!

307
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,001
Smurfs!

308
00:18:32,302 --> 00:18:33,887
Oh, wow.

309
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:41,562
Castles and palaces everywhere!

310
00:18:41,729 --> 00:18:44,690
- And green goblins!
- And red trolls.

311
00:18:45,607 --> 00:18:47,901
And look at the giant princess!

312
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:52,865
This village is amazing, Papa.

313
00:18:52,948 --> 00:18:55,701
Yes, and likely very dangerous.

314
00:18:55,784 --> 00:18:58,120
Until we rescue Clumsy and get back home,

315
00:18:58,203 --> 00:19:02,041
I need you all to stay close
and do exactly as I say.

316
00:19:02,124 --> 00:19:04,168
- Smurf's honour.
- If you say so.

317
00:19:04,251 --> 00:19:05,377
You can count on us, Papa.

318
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:07,796
They can see us! Camouflage.

319
00:19:08,422 --> 00:19:10,466
Blend in.

320
00:19:23,771 --> 00:19:26,065
Well, I guess this is our stop. Let's go.

321
00:19:26,148 --> 00:19:28,692
We get to climb another tree.

322
00:19:28,776 --> 00:19:31,236
Watch out, watch out.
Hang on, everybody. Hang on!

323
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,905
- Brainy.
- That's it.

324
00:19:33,781 --> 00:19:37,034
- Thanks a lot. Have a good night.
- I hope Clumsy can breathe in that box.

325
00:19:37,117 --> 00:19:39,787
How are we supposed to
find Clumsy in there?

326
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:42,122
- I could attempt to smurf the probability...
- Brainy!

327
00:19:42,206 --> 00:19:44,750
- We'll look through every window.
- I don't do windows.

328
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,794
- Now, let's get smurfing.
- You heard him. Come on.

329
00:19:46,877 --> 00:19:49,338
- Every window?
- Piece of cake.

330
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:52,132
- Grace?
- Hello?

331
00:19:52,216 --> 00:19:54,718
Guess what? Guess what, guess what?

332
00:19:55,969 --> 00:19:58,639
Okay. They invented a zero-calorie pizza.

333
00:19:58,722 --> 00:20:01,392
- No, but that's a good idea.
- Yes. They found...

334
00:20:03,143 --> 00:20:04,228
Baby kicked.

335
00:20:06,522 --> 00:20:07,773
- Hi.
- Hi.

336
00:20:08,023 --> 00:20:09,149
Please say hello.

337
00:20:18,409 --> 00:20:19,952
- Please.
- Hello, little Sea-Monkey.

338
00:20:20,744 --> 00:20:23,080
This is the sound of my voice.

339
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:27,167
Hello, son or daughter. Hello.

340
00:20:27,835 --> 00:20:29,920
Hello.

341
00:20:30,546 --> 00:20:33,215
That is not the sound of your voice.
That is the voice of a robot.

342
00:20:33,424 --> 00:20:35,843
Our child is gonna be attached to the toaster.

343
00:20:35,926 --> 00:20:38,053
Or the new VP of marketing.

344
00:20:38,512 --> 00:20:42,182
No. No! Oh, my goodness! Oh, my gosh!

345
00:20:42,266 --> 00:20:43,350
- It's...
- It's provisional.

346
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:46,478
If I wow Cruella de Odile,
then I'll keep the job.

347
00:20:46,562 --> 00:20:49,732
If not, then my head'll be on a pike
next to the last guy.

348
00:20:50,024 --> 00:20:52,234
Well, wow you will! You wowed me.

349
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:53,861
But I have two days.

350
00:20:54,194 --> 00:20:56,071
- Yikes.
- I know.

351
00:20:56,155 --> 00:20:58,240
What if I don't get them done in time?

352
00:20:58,323 --> 00:21:00,284
Oh, no, you can't come to the ultrasound.

353
00:21:02,786 --> 00:21:04,204
Unless...

354
00:21:04,288 --> 00:21:07,166
Wait, the backup ads we have
did fine in focus groups.

355
00:21:07,249 --> 00:21:10,085
I could retool those.
I'd have to work around the clock.

356
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:16,759
Azrael, we've come so far,

357
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:21,013
yet ever am I haunted by
the same familiar riddle.

358
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:25,142
How to find the Smurfs?

359
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:27,644
If only I...

360
00:21:28,062 --> 00:21:31,774
I'm sorry, is my thinking
interrupting your vile hacking?

361
00:21:32,107 --> 00:21:36,195
If only I had something of theirs.
A drop of spittle. A fingernail.

362
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:41,617
Some hair, even.
Then I could make some Smurf magic.

363
00:21:44,828 --> 00:21:46,830
Very nice. Are you done now?

364
00:21:47,081 --> 00:21:48,290
I don't want to look at it.

365
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:51,668
What? What?

366
00:21:53,837 --> 00:21:58,592
Is that... No. No, it can't be.

367
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:00,469
It is.

368
00:22:01,387 --> 00:22:04,890
The tawny locks of Smurfette.

369
00:22:06,225 --> 00:22:13,357
Sweet follicular ambrosia!
Silky strands ofjoy.

370
00:22:13,982 --> 00:22:17,319
Mixed with a fair amount of cat vomit.

371
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:22,825
Yes. Yes, I am a genius!

372
00:22:24,243 --> 00:22:27,871
With my skills, even this small trifle
of smurfiness

373
00:22:27,996 --> 00:22:31,458
will yield me just enough power
to catch them all!

374
00:22:33,001 --> 00:22:38,799
I must find a laboratory with which to tease
the magic from these precious little strands.

375
00:22:44,179 --> 00:22:48,434
Yes. It's a bit small,
but this should do nicely!

376
00:22:50,394 --> 00:22:52,688
It's even got its own cauldron.

377
00:22:55,149 --> 00:22:56,734
What died in here?

378
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,404
Open. Open. Open. Open. Open!

379
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:09,455
Somebody's been working a dark
and terrible magic in there.

380
00:23:17,212 --> 00:23:19,131
What is that?

381
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:38,692
Oh, baby.

382
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:43,155
Daddy is home.

383
00:23:45,574 --> 00:23:46,992
Come on.

384
00:23:47,076 --> 00:23:50,621
Papa, I'm familiar with 613 shades of blue,

385
00:23:50,704 --> 00:23:52,581
- and that moon is not one of them.
- Papa?

386
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:57,378
Stay calm, everyone.
If the portal opened once, it can open again.

387
00:23:57,461 --> 00:24:01,340
How are we gonna open a magical portal
when we can't even find Clumsy?

388
00:24:01,423 --> 00:24:03,008
Hey, I think I see something up there.

389
00:24:31,412 --> 00:24:32,454
Oh, no.

390
00:24:44,091 --> 00:24:46,343
Clumsy? Is that you?

391
00:24:46,927 --> 00:24:48,011
Hello.

392
00:24:49,555 --> 00:24:51,682
Help! Help!

393
00:24:57,521 --> 00:24:59,148
Oh, smurf.

394
00:25:09,033 --> 00:25:10,534
Hey.

395
00:25:10,868 --> 00:25:12,786
"Berry Boom."

396
00:25:38,479 --> 00:25:39,688
Patrick!

397
00:25:57,247 --> 00:25:59,249
Elway. Elway.

398
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:01,919
I'm sure this is the box.
When I get my hands on him...

399
00:26:02,002 --> 00:26:03,295
- Someone's coming!
- Smurfs!

400
00:26:03,379 --> 00:26:04,463
What is it?

401
00:26:07,466 --> 00:26:08,550
No, no!

402
00:26:09,093 --> 00:26:12,304
No, no, no, no. Come on, come on, come on.
Please, please.

403
00:26:12,763 --> 00:26:14,014
Elway.

404
00:26:14,515 --> 00:26:17,768
Elway. Did you do that?

405
00:26:18,352 --> 00:26:20,062
- Come on, put a little smurf into it.
- Hang on, Clumsy.

406
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:21,939
- I got this side.
- All together now.

407
00:26:22,022 --> 00:26:23,649
- Crikey.
- Oh, dear.

408
00:26:25,651 --> 00:26:27,194
- Now what, lads?
- What happened to Clumsy?

409
00:26:27,277 --> 00:26:28,946
- I bet they ate him. Let's go home.
- Hide.

410
00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:31,657
Go! Pull the lid!

411
00:26:37,287 --> 00:26:38,497
Gross.

412
00:26:43,419 --> 00:26:44,628
This is so...

413
00:27:01,103 --> 00:27:03,689
- That's Clumsy!
- Charge, Smurfs! Charge!

414
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:05,983
- Out of the way, big guy.
- Clumsy, we're coming!

415
00:27:06,066 --> 00:27:07,151
Excuse me. Pardon me.

416
00:27:07,234 --> 00:27:09,319
- This is for Clumsy!
- Wait for me!

417
00:27:09,695 --> 00:27:11,447
- Oh, God!
- Please don't hurt me!

418
00:27:11,864 --> 00:27:14,033
- Please, I just want to go home!
- Are you...

419
00:27:17,536 --> 00:27:18,620
Did you just talk?

420
00:27:18,871 --> 00:27:22,458
I'm not saying till you put down
the giant spiky thing.

421
00:27:22,541 --> 00:27:24,001
- Clumsy!
- Clumsy, where are you?

422
00:27:24,084 --> 00:27:25,669
- Make yourself known!
- Smurf us a sign!

423
00:27:25,753 --> 00:27:27,588
- Come out, Clumsy!
- Smurf out, smurf out, wherever you are.

424
00:27:27,671 --> 00:27:29,506
- Are you there?
- Come to my voice, laddie!

425
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,008
- Where are you?
- Can you hear us?

426
00:27:31,467 --> 00:27:33,552
- Get out of here!
- Look out!

427
00:27:33,927 --> 00:27:36,638
- Too much aggression!
- Go back to the sewers!

428
00:27:36,722 --> 00:27:38,015
Kiss my smurf!

429
00:27:38,098 --> 00:27:41,393
You all find Clumsy! The giant is mine!

430
00:27:42,311 --> 00:27:43,687
- Over here!
- Get him!

431
00:27:43,771 --> 00:27:46,106
Have you had enough? Tap out?

432
00:27:47,066 --> 00:27:50,611
Okay, so you're like... You're blue, and...

433
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:54,073
- Oh, gosh, are you okay?
- Quickly!

434
00:27:54,156 --> 00:27:55,407
- This way! This way!
- Follow me, Smurfs!

435
00:27:55,491 --> 00:27:57,493
- Clumsy! Where are you?
- Look out!

436
00:27:57,618 --> 00:27:58,869
Other way! Other way!

437
00:27:58,952 --> 00:28:00,412
- Run, Smurfs!
- Come on!

438
00:28:00,579 --> 00:28:02,122
Run!

439
00:28:02,831 --> 00:28:04,208
Elway!

440
00:28:04,291 --> 00:28:06,627
- Smurf for your lives!
- Clumsy, where the smurf are you?

441
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,171
- Stinky breath.
- Spread out!

442
00:28:09,463 --> 00:28:12,049
Grace! Run!

443
00:28:12,216 --> 00:28:16,428
Stop bleating like a sheep
and let me hog-tie you, you wriggly numptie.

444
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:18,680
Grace, we're being attacked!

445
00:28:19,014 --> 00:28:21,350
Do not be fooled by their cuteness!

446
00:28:21,683 --> 00:28:23,811
It's okay, it's okay.

447
00:28:26,855 --> 00:28:28,023
They're friendly.

448
00:28:28,565 --> 00:28:30,442
You're lucky your lassie stepped in.

449
00:28:30,526 --> 00:28:33,612
I was about to make haggis
with your innards.

450
00:28:42,246 --> 00:28:45,290
This is it. This is it, Azrael!

451
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:49,503
Smurfette's hair goes in here,
flows through the Smurf essence extractor,

452
00:28:49,586 --> 00:28:52,005
and finally, I have my Smurfilator!

453
00:28:53,006 --> 00:28:56,510
It's the pièce de résistance. The <i>crème de la...</i>

454
00:28:57,636 --> 00:29:00,389
Would you care for a mint when you're done?

455
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:03,225
Yes, yes, yes!

456
00:29:03,434 --> 00:29:05,144
With this precious elixir,

457
00:29:05,227 --> 00:29:12,067
my sorcerous spell shall be powerful
beyond all measurable measurement.

458
00:29:15,654 --> 00:29:20,909
This one tiny drop will give me
the power to capture them all.

459
00:29:31,378 --> 00:29:32,713
This is great!

460
00:29:32,921 --> 00:29:36,675
<i>La la la la la la</i>
<i>Smurf the whole day long</i>

461
00:29:36,967 --> 00:29:41,013
<i>Next time you're feeling blue</i>
<i>Just let a smile begin</i>

462
00:29:41,096 --> 00:29:45,434
<i>Happy things will come to you</i>
<i>So smurf yourself a grin</i>

463
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:48,103
It's so obvious
that what you're doing is wrong.

464
00:29:48,187 --> 00:29:49,646
Oh, really? After you.

465
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:51,148
How crazy is this?

466
00:29:51,231 --> 00:29:54,443
There are little blue people
singing in our kitchen!

467
00:29:57,696 --> 00:30:00,908
So you're sticking with your
"this is actually happening" theory?

468
00:30:00,991 --> 00:30:02,618
Sorry.

469
00:30:03,243 --> 00:30:07,623
Okay. It says here Smurfs are
mythical creatures from Belgium,

470
00:30:07,706 --> 00:30:09,792
- also known as Schtroumpfs...
- Yeah.

471
00:30:10,209 --> 00:30:11,710
Documented by Peyo.

472
00:30:12,002 --> 00:30:16,131
Also says that they bring good luck.
Like leprechauns to the Irish.

473
00:30:16,215 --> 00:30:18,634
It says they're mythical, Grace.

474
00:30:19,301 --> 00:30:20,719
- I'm so sorry, Master Winslow.
- That was great.

475
00:30:20,803 --> 00:30:22,304
Well, they look pretty real to me.

476
00:30:22,429 --> 00:30:23,806
Come on.

477
00:30:28,143 --> 00:30:29,978
- Excuse me.
- Okay, to review.

478
00:30:30,062 --> 00:30:34,566
You guys come from a magic forest
where you live in oversized mushrooms.

479
00:30:34,692 --> 00:30:36,735
- Yes.
- You're being chased by an evil wizard.

480
00:30:36,819 --> 00:30:38,237
- Yeah.
- And you're trapped in New York

481
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,947
- until there's a blue moon...
- Very good.

482
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:42,908
And you like to use the
extremely imprecise term "smurf"

483
00:30:42,991 --> 00:30:45,160
- for just about everything.
- Smurfxactly.

484
00:30:47,496 --> 00:30:50,249
And you're all
named after your personalities?

485
00:30:50,416 --> 00:30:53,877
Do you get your names when you're born,
or after you've exhibited certain traits?

486
00:30:53,961 --> 00:30:55,129
- Yeah.
- Yep.

487
00:30:55,212 --> 00:30:56,463
Yeah, whatever.

488
00:30:56,547 --> 00:30:59,717
Master Winslow, there must be
something about the blue moon

489
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,427
on your magic window machine.

490
00:31:01,635 --> 00:31:04,304
Just what is this magic searching device?

491
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:06,140
Right now, I'm using Google.

492
00:31:08,142 --> 00:31:10,102
- Google.
- Google.

493
00:31:12,563 --> 00:31:17,526
Okay. " Blue moon.
A full moon that occurs twice in one month.

494
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:19,278
"A figurative construct..."

495
00:31:19,695 --> 00:31:21,280
- Much like yourselves.
- Hey!

496
00:31:21,363 --> 00:31:24,158
"But the moon itself
doesn't appear to be blue."

497
00:31:24,324 --> 00:31:25,576
- What?
- Not blue?

498
00:31:25,659 --> 00:31:27,369
- Perfect!
- Now we'll never get home!

499
00:31:27,453 --> 00:31:31,498
No cause for alarm, my little Smurfs.
If we're to open the portal home,

500
00:31:31,582 --> 00:31:33,417
I'll just have to smurf us a potion

501
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,877
to invoke the blue moon.

502
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,295
You hear that, honey?

503
00:31:36,378 --> 00:31:38,797
They're only staying till
an actual blue moon rises.

504
00:31:39,089 --> 00:31:42,426
Which could happen if the little blue
Santa man makes a magic potion,

505
00:31:42,509 --> 00:31:45,220
which, at this point,
seems completely plausible.

506
00:31:45,304 --> 00:31:46,972
- Want a bite?
- No, thank you.

507
00:31:47,056 --> 00:31:50,768
Of course, the stars will
need to be perfectly aligned.

508
00:31:50,851 --> 00:31:55,314
And when that might be is hard to determine
without the proper instrument.

509
00:31:55,856 --> 00:31:58,233
Master Winslow,
might I borrow your stargazer?

510
00:31:58,317 --> 00:31:59,401
My what-whatzer?

511
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:02,321
He doesn't have a stargazer. Do you?

512
00:32:02,404 --> 00:32:05,240
- This is all my fault.
- We're all gonna die.

513
00:32:05,324 --> 00:32:08,077
- We're all gonna die!
- Smurf out of it, scaredy-brains!

514
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,620
- One Panicky Smurf is enough!
- Hey!

515
00:32:10,037 --> 00:32:13,791
Besides, Papa had a vision,
and everything turns out smurfy.

516
00:32:14,041 --> 00:32:15,292
Right, Papa?

517
00:32:17,753 --> 00:32:21,632
Yes, yes. It all turns out just fine.

518
00:32:25,886 --> 00:32:30,057
We must find this Smurf thief.
Stop your complaining.

519
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:32,142
If I were a Smurf, where would I go?

520
00:32:32,434 --> 00:32:35,646
You there, you there. Fancy pants.
Have you seen any little blue men?

521
00:32:35,729 --> 00:32:38,273
- Absolutely. What price are we talking about?
- You're selling them?

522
00:32:38,357 --> 00:32:40,442
- Have you looked in the drawer, sweetie?
- Wait, what drawer?

523
00:32:40,526 --> 00:32:43,028
- In the kitchen, Lilly.
- Who is this Lilly?

524
00:32:43,112 --> 00:32:45,531
Are you kidding?
She's the hottest girl in my department.

525
00:32:45,614 --> 00:32:47,825
Please, please. Please, young woodsman.

526
00:32:47,908 --> 00:32:52,329
What does the temperature of this Lilly
have to do with the finding of Smurfs?

527
00:32:52,413 --> 00:32:54,998
- Take your meds, man.
- What?

528
00:32:56,333 --> 00:32:59,002
Is everyone in this realm completely insane?

529
00:33:01,964 --> 00:33:04,007
Thank the gods, a local wizard. Excellent.

530
00:33:04,341 --> 00:33:06,260
Pardon me, wise sir?

531
00:33:06,343 --> 00:33:08,595
By any chance, have you seen
any little blue men?

532
00:33:10,222 --> 00:33:11,890
They're everywhere!

533
00:33:12,224 --> 00:33:15,060
I knew it. I knew it!
I told you we were close, Azrael.

534
00:33:15,602 --> 00:33:16,729
I know.

535
00:33:17,062 --> 00:33:21,775
Now, just take one, everybody.
We have to make sure our smurfberries last.

536
00:33:21,859 --> 00:33:24,194
Great. We're gonna be here how long?

537
00:33:24,278 --> 00:33:26,780
Not long. First, we have to get a stargazer.

538
00:33:26,905 --> 00:33:30,117
Next, find a book of spells
and then smurf a portal

539
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,620
and we're home.
Very simple, my little Smurfs.

540
00:33:33,704 --> 00:33:35,330
Bye, Elway.

541
00:33:35,414 --> 00:33:37,708
Someone looks smurfalish!

542
00:33:37,791 --> 00:33:39,960
- Why you wearing a leash?
- It's a tie.

543
00:33:40,044 --> 00:33:42,296
- Does it keep your neck warm?
- No.

544
00:33:42,504 --> 00:33:46,091
Clearly, it functions as an aid in his craft,
like a blacksmith's apron.

545
00:33:46,175 --> 00:33:48,385
I wear it because it's what
everyone wears at work.

546
00:33:48,594 --> 00:33:50,596
What are you, you pasty giant?

547
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:54,850
I try to get people to buy things
by analysing market trend predictions.

548
00:33:54,933 --> 00:33:58,687
Predictions! He's a fortune teller.

549
00:33:58,771 --> 00:34:01,315
Look, I would love to explain
but I am super late. I gotta go.

550
00:34:01,398 --> 00:34:03,484
- I really don't have time for this.
- What?

551
00:34:03,859 --> 00:34:05,277
You had one outfit on,

552
00:34:05,361 --> 00:34:08,364
and now you're wearing something
completely different.

553
00:34:08,447 --> 00:34:09,740
- Yeah. It...
- Now, Smurfette,

554
00:34:09,823 --> 00:34:11,950
she probably got the other one dirty.

555
00:34:12,034 --> 00:34:13,869
- Let's not embarrass her.
- Sorry.

556
00:34:13,952 --> 00:34:16,330
Thanks for letting us stay in your mushroom,
Miss Grace.

557
00:34:16,413 --> 00:34:20,334
- It's really nice.
- Well, thank you. I'm glad you like it.

558
00:34:20,417 --> 00:34:25,130
I like our little mushroom, too. But you know,
somebody wants a bigger mushroom.

559
00:34:25,464 --> 00:34:28,050
But, then you'd be further apart.

560
00:34:28,217 --> 00:34:31,345
You said it, sister. Okay, I've gotta go.
I've got an appointment.

561
00:34:31,428 --> 00:34:33,097
I've got a baby on the way, so...

562
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:36,517
Wait, wait. We can't just
leave them here alone, without an adult.

563
00:34:37,601 --> 00:34:39,853
I'm 546 years old.

564
00:34:39,937 --> 00:34:41,480
Of course you are.

565
00:34:41,563 --> 00:34:43,107
- They'll be fine. They'll be fine.
- All right.

566
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:45,359
- Love you.
- Okay.

567
00:34:45,984 --> 00:34:47,319
- Bye. Bye.
- Bye, Grace! Goodbye.

568
00:34:47,403 --> 00:34:49,738
By the way, I wouldn't go anywhere
if I were you.

569
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:51,156
Why not?

570
00:34:52,157 --> 00:34:55,703
Our world doesn't do well
with visitors from other places.

571
00:34:55,786 --> 00:34:57,496
I mean, look what happened to E.T.

572
00:34:58,497 --> 00:35:00,999
It's a movie. A moving picture.

573
00:35:01,375 --> 00:35:03,502
Book. Just stay, okay?

574
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:07,756
Great. He's gone
and we still don't have a stargazer.

575
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:12,010
Wait a smurf. If he's a fortune teller,
he reads stars all the time.

576
00:35:12,094 --> 00:35:15,389
Ergo, it's at his place of business.

577
00:35:15,681 --> 00:35:17,224
Excellent work, Brainy.

578
00:35:17,307 --> 00:35:19,268
What are we waiting for? Let's ride.

579
00:35:19,351 --> 00:35:21,186
- Yeah, come on, guys.
- Hey, stop it.

580
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:24,022
- Come on, Smurfs!
- Let's go get that stargazer.

581
00:35:25,399 --> 00:35:27,526
- Surprise, surprise.
- Oh, no.

582
00:35:27,609 --> 00:35:31,280
Clumsy, I think it might be best

583
00:35:31,363 --> 00:35:33,449
if you stay here. You know?

584
00:35:33,741 --> 00:35:36,035
Smurf an eye on the mushroom.

585
00:35:40,289 --> 00:35:42,833
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

586
00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:45,461
- This way, Smurfs!
- Let's follow Mr Winslow.

587
00:35:45,544 --> 00:35:48,130
Well, I can smurf an eye on the mushroom.

588
00:35:48,213 --> 00:35:49,923
Smurf away!

589
00:35:50,007 --> 00:35:52,176
- Let's smurf this joint.
- Is he down there?

590
00:35:52,259 --> 00:35:53,469
- Taxi!
- Can you see him?

591
00:35:53,552 --> 00:35:55,971
Look, he's getting into
the mechanical wagon.

592
00:35:56,055 --> 00:35:57,556
- Oh, no.
- Clearly that distance is too great...

593
00:35:57,639 --> 00:36:00,309
- Off you go!
- No! Gutsy!

594
00:36:00,392 --> 00:36:02,311
Come on, Smurfs! Smurfabunga!

595
00:36:02,436 --> 00:36:04,188
Goodbye, blue world.

596
00:36:04,271 --> 00:36:05,981
Use your hat, you ninny!

597
00:36:06,231 --> 00:36:09,151
Couldn't we just have taken the stairs?

598
00:36:10,235 --> 00:36:11,653
- There we go.
- Not funny, Gutsy.

599
00:36:12,696 --> 00:36:14,740
- It was a little funny.
- Smurfs.

600
00:36:15,824 --> 00:36:17,868
We're stopping. Hold on tight.

601
00:36:17,951 --> 00:36:19,286
Not to me, Grouchy.

602
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:21,872
Oh, did I do that? Sorry.

603
00:36:21,955 --> 00:36:24,041
- Keep the change.
- Thanks, man.

604
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:26,752
Master Winslow, we really need your help.

605
00:36:26,835 --> 00:36:27,961
- Hey.
- Right here.

606
00:36:28,045 --> 00:36:29,213
What are you doing here?

607
00:36:29,296 --> 00:36:33,092
What part of "we need a stargazer"
don't you understand, you numptie?

608
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:36,845
- You can't be out in public.
- Who are you talking to?

609
00:36:37,012 --> 00:36:40,349
If we could just have a quick look around
in your predicting parlour...

610
00:36:40,432 --> 00:36:42,518
- We really wanna go home.
- Come on, man, I gotta go.

611
00:36:42,601 --> 00:36:44,728
- Fine. Just come here, come here.
- Please, please.

612
00:36:45,104 --> 00:36:46,438
All of you. Trust me.

613
00:36:46,772 --> 00:36:48,232
Careful. Hey, watch the smurfberries.

614
00:36:48,315 --> 00:36:50,734
I'm not going... Hey!

615
00:36:50,818 --> 00:36:52,945
- Be quiet.
- It's dark in here.

616
00:36:53,028 --> 00:36:54,363
All right, who smurfed?

617
00:36:55,447 --> 00:36:57,241
Hey! Get your hand out of my kilt.

618
00:36:57,324 --> 00:37:00,160
- That's not my hand.
- Hey, ticklish.

619
00:37:02,871 --> 00:37:05,207
- Morning. Morning.
- Good morning, Mr Winslow.

620
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:07,292
- Congratulations on your promotion.
- Thank you.

621
00:37:07,376 --> 00:37:09,461
I hope you guys like desk drawers,
because that's where...

622
00:37:09,545 --> 00:37:11,755
- You're late.
- Odile!

623
00:37:12,548 --> 00:37:13,674
You were in my office.

624
00:37:14,007 --> 00:37:16,760
It's my building,
and we have much work to do.

625
00:37:16,844 --> 00:37:20,013
The launch for Jouvenel is tomorrow night.
Is your concept ready?

626
00:37:20,097 --> 00:37:22,933
Close. I had a crazy morning.

627
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:25,144
What are you doing?

628
00:37:25,269 --> 00:37:29,523
Nothing. I'm excited.
I'm excited about all the concept ideas.

629
00:37:29,606 --> 00:37:34,403
And hungry. Sorry. Hungry for its success.

630
00:37:34,903 --> 00:37:36,030
Nervous energy.

631
00:37:36,113 --> 00:37:38,157
Nervous energy's what's going on up in here.

632
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,450
- I like it.
- Yep.

633
00:37:39,658 --> 00:37:43,454
- The fear of failure is a fabulous motivator.
- True that.

634
00:37:44,246 --> 00:37:45,789
Hey! Stop it.

635
00:37:45,873 --> 00:37:48,625
- Henri.
- Make it work.

636
00:37:48,917 --> 00:37:50,627
You have no idea.

637
00:37:50,961 --> 00:37:53,047
- What is this?
- Why did I get the armpit?

638
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:56,675
- Stop pushing me.
- Go easy on the cologne tomorrow.

639
00:37:56,759 --> 00:37:58,635
Are you crazy?

640
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:00,596
- You're gonna get me fired.
- My hair!

641
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:03,932
I couldn't even breathe in there.
It smelled like the business end of a sheep.

642
00:38:04,016 --> 00:38:05,350
- I don't see a stargazer.
- How you doing?

643
00:38:05,434 --> 00:38:09,354
I'm sorry, Master Winslow,
but we badly need to borrow your stargazer.

644
00:38:09,438 --> 00:38:13,150
I don't have a stargazer, okay?

645
00:38:13,233 --> 00:38:17,780
It's not something people of this century
just have, especially here.

646
00:38:17,863 --> 00:38:21,825
- Not happy.
- Now if you'll excuse me, I have to work.

647
00:38:22,409 --> 00:38:25,412
Well, perhaps we could sing
to help things along.

648
00:38:25,496 --> 00:38:28,791
And then we'll get the stargazer.
Come along, Smurfs.

649
00:38:28,874 --> 00:38:32,211
<i>La la la la la la</i>
<i>Sing a happy song</i>

650
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,838
<i>La la la la la la</i>
<i>Smurf the whole day long</i>

651
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:36,924
Stop.

652
00:38:37,007 --> 00:38:38,342
<i>La la la la la la</i>

653
00:38:38,467 --> 00:38:39,551
Stop!

654
00:38:39,635 --> 00:38:41,553
<i>Sing a happy song</i>

655
00:38:41,637 --> 00:38:44,723
Come on. None of you find that song
just the tiniest bit annoying?

656
00:38:44,807 --> 00:38:46,266
I find it annoying.

657
00:38:46,892 --> 00:38:49,186
Well, what do you sing at work?

658
00:38:49,269 --> 00:38:51,563
- I don't sing at work.
- What?

659
00:38:51,647 --> 00:38:53,649
- And you have to wear a leash.
- Harsh.

660
00:38:53,732 --> 00:38:55,984
I know. How about if we hum?

661
00:38:58,737 --> 00:38:59,822
Please stop humming.

662
00:39:06,537 --> 00:39:08,038
I need to hone my message here.

663
00:39:08,205 --> 00:39:09,373
I've got a message.

664
00:39:09,456 --> 00:39:13,293
"Always chew with your mouth closed."
Papa taught us that.

665
00:39:13,377 --> 00:39:15,254
That's good. You should use that.

666
00:39:15,337 --> 00:39:17,297
Or, "Dance and be happy."

667
00:39:17,381 --> 00:39:19,341
How about, "Grab life by the grapes"?

668
00:39:19,425 --> 00:39:22,511
- "Turn that frown upside down."
- "Always bet on blue."

669
00:39:22,594 --> 00:39:25,973
- "Have a smurfy day."
- "I kissed a Smurf and I liked it"?

670
00:39:26,849 --> 00:39:29,476
It's an embarrassment of riches.

671
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,936
They're giving you gold here.

672
00:39:31,145 --> 00:39:32,980
- Thank you.
- Master Winslow,

673
00:39:33,063 --> 00:39:36,567
you'll know it's the right message
if it comes from the heart.

674
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:37,943
- Right, Smurfs?
- Yeah.

675
00:39:38,027 --> 00:39:39,278
- You said it.
- Absolutely.

676
00:39:39,361 --> 00:39:41,572
- Of course.
- Welcome to my world.

677
00:39:46,368 --> 00:39:49,329
I love emerging dramatically
through the smoke.

678
00:39:51,206 --> 00:39:57,129
It makes... It makes me feel
so deliciously mysterious.

679
00:39:58,338 --> 00:40:01,550
Also, it gives the skin a wonderful glow.

680
00:40:01,759 --> 00:40:02,885
What?

681
00:40:03,093 --> 00:40:04,303
Where? Where?

682
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:07,681
What?

683
00:40:10,059 --> 00:40:13,437
Curses! So close.

684
00:40:13,896 --> 00:40:15,564
What?

685
00:40:18,067 --> 00:40:20,652
Theirs is upside-down.

686
00:40:20,861 --> 00:40:24,114
Idiots. They painted it wrong. Come, Azrael.

687
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:26,283
- Hi.
- Hello.

688
00:40:26,367 --> 00:40:27,409
What are you doing?

689
00:40:27,493 --> 00:40:29,828
Just greening things up a bit.

690
00:40:29,912 --> 00:40:33,624
That's so sweet. That's very sweet but,

691
00:40:33,707 --> 00:40:36,251
you know, I'm not so sure
this stuff's gonna grow out here.

692
00:40:36,335 --> 00:40:39,963
We'll see. Smurfs have a very blue thumb.

693
00:40:40,547 --> 00:40:42,091
So where is everybody else?

694
00:40:42,174 --> 00:40:43,801
They went to get a stargazer

695
00:40:43,884 --> 00:40:46,178
so Papa can smurf a blue moon
to get us home.

696
00:40:46,261 --> 00:40:47,513
And they went without you?

697
00:40:47,596 --> 00:40:50,516
Yeah. I mean, who knows why?

698
00:40:53,185 --> 00:40:54,686
- Hey!
- Sorry!

699
00:40:55,104 --> 00:40:56,397
Why don't we come inside?

700
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:56,563
- Smurfs, where are you?
- Make sure to demonstrate that

701
00:40:56,563 --> 00:40:59,316
- Smurfs, where are you?
- Make sure to demonstrate that

702
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,443
this new anti-ageing cream can make

703
00:41:01,902 --> 00:41:07,116
any woman look beautiful, young, vibrant.
It's almost magical.

704
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:09,326
Astonishing, really.

705
00:41:12,788 --> 00:41:14,748
I see no transformation.

706
00:41:14,832 --> 00:41:17,209
- Your potion has no power.
- Excuse me?

707
00:41:17,292 --> 00:41:20,129
Well, she's still an eye-offending dogfish,
if you ask me.

708
00:41:20,212 --> 00:41:23,632
- Sir!
- This is my mother who you're speaking of.

709
00:41:23,924 --> 00:41:26,301
I'm so sorry. I didn't realise.

710
00:41:26,385 --> 00:41:28,011
How sad for you in 30 years.

711
00:41:28,637 --> 00:41:31,223
Henri, escort this lunatic out.

712
00:41:31,306 --> 00:41:32,558
- "Lunatic"?
- Security!

713
00:41:32,641 --> 00:41:35,269
I am the great and powerful Gargamel!

714
00:41:35,352 --> 00:41:39,314
"Lunatic." Could a lunatic do this?

715
00:41:39,481 --> 00:41:42,026
Alakazootiful!

716
00:41:56,707 --> 00:41:58,083
How did you do that?

717
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:00,377
Yes, and seriously, me next.

718
00:42:00,586 --> 00:42:05,049
So sorry, but lunatics and great wizards
never reveal their secrets.

719
00:42:06,717 --> 00:42:09,887
Come, Azrael! Now, where are my Smurfs?

720
00:42:10,012 --> 00:42:11,638
No, no, no, no, no. Don't go.

721
00:42:12,556 --> 00:42:14,433
- I need to know what you just did.
- Not telling.

722
00:42:14,558 --> 00:42:17,728
Please, <i>señor.</i> Can you do that again?

723
00:42:19,104 --> 00:42:21,565
You may attempt to persuade me.

724
00:42:23,317 --> 00:42:25,277
What is it that you desire?

725
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:27,696
Riches?

726
00:42:28,989 --> 00:42:30,032
Fame?

727
00:42:31,367 --> 00:42:32,409
Fortune?

728
00:42:33,744 --> 00:42:35,120
With my help,

729
00:42:35,746 --> 00:42:41,835
the whole world
will know the name that is Garbagesmell.

730
00:42:43,879 --> 00:42:44,922
Gargamel.

731
00:42:45,589 --> 00:42:52,388
Yes. With my help, the whole world
will know the genius that is Gargamel.

732
00:42:54,973 --> 00:42:56,100
I'm...

733
00:42:57,893 --> 00:43:02,689
I'm sorry. Did you just say "genius"?

734
00:43:03,857 --> 00:43:07,277
So, even though
I'm what you might call accident-prone,

735
00:43:07,403 --> 00:43:10,531
on the bright side, I did
land us all here in your little mushroom,

736
00:43:10,739 --> 00:43:12,199
and we got to meet you and Patrick.

737
00:43:12,324 --> 00:43:15,744
You're so sweet. And I know how you feel.
I'm so clumsy, too.

738
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:17,830
Well, I used to be.

739
00:43:18,122 --> 00:43:19,373
- Really?
- Yeah.

740
00:43:19,832 --> 00:43:22,584
So how long did it take you to...

741
00:43:24,503 --> 00:43:25,796
Gosh.

742
00:43:25,879 --> 00:43:28,048
...un-fumble your feet?

743
00:43:29,133 --> 00:43:33,887
Well, about as long as it takes to realise
that nobody's just one thing.

744
00:43:35,055 --> 00:43:36,598
You can be anything you wanna be.

745
00:43:38,642 --> 00:43:41,103
- "Hero Smurf."
- Yeah.

746
00:43:42,688 --> 00:43:43,772
Probably not.

747
00:43:45,774 --> 00:43:48,110
- Hey, Brainy, help me figure this out.
- Let me show you.

748
00:43:48,235 --> 00:43:49,820
First, you put your...

749
00:43:50,946 --> 00:43:52,197
Works every time.

750
00:43:52,281 --> 00:43:54,742
<i>La la la la la la</i>
<i>Sing a happy song</i>

751
00:43:54,825 --> 00:43:58,287
This is a fascinating wind machine
you have here.

752
00:44:04,585 --> 00:44:06,462
- Hi, Patrick.
- Grace, help. Help!

753
00:44:06,545 --> 00:44:09,298
They are everywhere
and they won't stop singing.

754
00:44:09,423 --> 00:44:13,010
I cannot get a thing done.
Please come and get these guys.

755
00:44:16,221 --> 00:44:17,931
<i>Señor</i> Gargamel, I'll be frank.

756
00:44:18,182 --> 00:44:24,271
Clinique, Lancôme, MAC. They will kill
to get what you have in that ring.

757
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,981
Not if we kill them first.

758
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:30,694
Let's see, we're going to need some knights,
preferably in shining armour,

759
00:44:31,195 --> 00:44:33,822
some bowmen, poison arrows.

760
00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:35,866
I like the way you think.

761
00:44:35,949 --> 00:44:37,743
And some spikes to mount their heads on.

762
00:44:37,993 --> 00:44:39,411
Well, it is all about the presentation.

763
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:43,457
And, of course, all of our testing
would be animal cruelty-free?

764
00:44:43,707 --> 00:44:46,460
What, they pay extra for the animal cruelty?
Is that it?

765
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:47,878
Get out of here.

766
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:53,675
You have a wicked sense of humour.

767
00:44:53,759 --> 00:44:55,761
- We like that, don't we?
- Hey, out of here!

768
00:44:55,844 --> 00:44:57,054
Henri?

769
00:44:57,679 --> 00:44:58,889
I said, get out of here.

770
00:44:59,056 --> 00:45:03,310
<i>Señor</i> Gargamel,
now you must assure me, darling,

771
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:07,314
that you can recreate whatever it was
that you did to my mother,

772
00:45:07,648 --> 00:45:09,566
but on a massive scale.

773
00:45:10,067 --> 00:45:13,570
Do that, and the world will worship you.

774
00:45:14,029 --> 00:45:16,156
- Did you hear that, Azrael?
- Yeah.

775
00:45:16,532 --> 00:45:23,622
"Worship." Oh, it rolls off the tongue
like flesh from a... Not pilgrim...

776
00:45:25,332 --> 00:45:26,750
Heretic. Yes, thank you.

777
00:45:28,168 --> 00:45:30,963
Thank the gods, a chamber pot.

778
00:45:31,338 --> 00:45:35,384
This swill that you call Dom Pérignon
has gone straight to my nether regions.

779
00:45:45,978 --> 00:45:49,398
Here, toss this out the window, yeah?
Today, please.

780
00:45:50,816 --> 00:45:53,193
Now, to the matter at hand.

781
00:45:54,028 --> 00:45:55,696
So do we have a deal, <i>señor?</i>

782
00:45:57,322 --> 00:45:59,616
Not quite, my sweet maiden.

783
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:05,414
You see, first I must have my Smurfs.

784
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:12,046
You guys just have to understand that
Patrick's under a lot of pressure right now.

785
00:46:12,129 --> 00:46:14,214
So if you could just lay low for a little bit...

786
00:46:14,298 --> 00:46:17,885
You have my word of honour, Miss Grace.
My Smurfs will not move from this bag.

787
00:46:17,968 --> 00:46:19,636
- Okay, good.
- Stargazer!

788
00:46:19,803 --> 00:46:22,014
- What?
- Stargazer! Let's go!

789
00:46:22,097 --> 00:46:23,307
- Everybody out! Come on!
- No, no, no!

790
00:46:23,390 --> 00:46:24,475
- Guys, let's go!
- No, no, no, no, no!

791
00:46:24,725 --> 00:46:26,602
- Full smurf ahead.
- No, wait, wait!

792
00:46:26,935 --> 00:46:28,020
Hit the deck!

793
00:46:28,395 --> 00:46:31,148
Hey, I'm walking here! I'm walking!

794
00:46:31,231 --> 00:46:32,983
- Save me!
- Hey, look out, Brainy.

795
00:46:33,067 --> 00:46:34,651
Can't everyone just slow down

796
00:46:34,735 --> 00:46:35,819
- and enjoy life?
- Get off me. Get off!

797
00:46:35,903 --> 00:46:36,945
Wait for it.

798
00:46:37,321 --> 00:46:38,697
I gotta get me one of those.

799
00:46:38,989 --> 00:46:40,074
Oh, my gosh!

800
00:46:40,157 --> 00:46:41,867
- Hey, lady! Hey!
- Wait, wait. Hold on!

801
00:46:41,950 --> 00:46:45,829
When we get inside, spread out
and find that stargazer.

802
00:46:45,913 --> 00:46:47,081
Come on, Smurfs!

803
00:47:09,395 --> 00:47:11,522
- Hey.
- Patrick, the Smurfs have gone AWOL.

804
00:47:11,647 --> 00:47:12,773
<i>Grace, are you running?</i>

805
00:47:12,856 --> 00:47:14,358
No, no, I'm totally fine,
but they need your help!

806
00:47:14,441 --> 00:47:16,276
Patrick, I'm afraid they're gonna
get themselves killed!

807
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,487
Sweetie, they're fine.
They can send us a tiny thank-you note

808
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:20,698
when they get back to shroom town.
Right after they invent paper.

809
00:47:20,823 --> 00:47:21,990
Patrick, they need you.

810
00:47:22,241 --> 00:47:23,701
- Honey...
- Patrick, I need you.

811
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:25,202
Oh, my gosh, please hurry!

812
00:47:25,494 --> 00:47:26,745
All right. Where are you?

813
00:47:27,371 --> 00:47:32,251
The man is a lunatic. It's not going to work.
I don't know, he needs Smoops.

814
00:47:32,334 --> 00:47:33,419
- "Smurfs."
- Smarps.

815
00:47:33,502 --> 00:47:36,380
No, no, "Smurfs." "Smurfs" with an...

816
00:47:36,547 --> 00:47:37,673
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

817
00:47:37,756 --> 00:47:39,091
You call that grovelling, you fool?

818
00:47:40,342 --> 00:47:42,594
Every village has an idiot. What?

819
00:47:43,721 --> 00:47:47,641
You're right. That's him!
Stop! Stop! Smurf thief!

820
00:47:47,850 --> 00:47:49,351
Smurf thief!

821
00:47:49,685 --> 00:47:51,019
Come on, guys, the dolls are here!

822
00:47:51,103 --> 00:47:54,857
Stargazer, stargazer, stargazer.
Stargazer, stargazer, stargazer, stargazer...

823
00:47:56,734 --> 00:47:59,737
So that's where all the unicorns went.

824
00:47:59,862 --> 00:48:02,698
I'm not afraid to go off on my own,
I thought you might like the company.

825
00:48:02,781 --> 00:48:04,241
Fine. Then hang on.

826
00:48:06,869 --> 00:48:10,456
A Smurf cannon! The only way to fly.

827
00:48:11,915 --> 00:48:13,000
Perfect.

828
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:18,672
Time to catch some air! Smurfabunga!

829
00:48:19,673 --> 00:48:21,258
That'll put some air up your skirt!

830
00:48:24,470 --> 00:48:26,305
Gotta be a stargazer up here somewhere.

831
00:48:26,513 --> 00:48:27,723
Predator!

832
00:48:30,768 --> 00:48:32,186
Smurf droppings.

833
00:48:34,396 --> 00:48:37,608
These are disgustingly tasty.

834
00:48:39,818 --> 00:48:41,070
Hello.

835
00:48:42,905 --> 00:48:43,947
Oh, creepy.

836
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:47,034
I hope they weren't looking
for a stargazer, too.

837
00:48:47,117 --> 00:48:48,744
Stargazers, stargazers...

838
00:48:48,869 --> 00:48:50,079
Dresses!

839
00:48:50,162 --> 00:48:53,582
You mean I can have
more than one kind of dress?

840
00:48:53,665 --> 00:48:54,708
What?

841
00:48:54,792 --> 00:48:56,835
Papa, I'm telling you,
we're never gonna find those...

842
00:48:56,919 --> 00:48:59,004
- Stargazers.
- They're dangerously high.

843
00:48:59,088 --> 00:49:01,548
You're right.
We're gonna need something tall.

844
00:49:08,722 --> 00:49:11,600
- Don't you think someone will notice us?
- Just act natural.

845
00:49:11,683 --> 00:49:13,268
- I'm a bear.
- Brainy!

846
00:49:15,104 --> 00:49:16,939
I'm coming. I'm coming, I'm coming, guys.

847
00:49:17,106 --> 00:49:18,941
Hold still, stairs!

848
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:20,901
Look at the stair-climbing toy!

849
00:49:20,984 --> 00:49:22,152
- Hey.
- What is that?

850
00:49:22,277 --> 00:49:23,362
- Let me see it.
- Careful.

851
00:49:23,445 --> 00:49:25,406
- I want one, too, Mommy!
- Let me see.

852
00:49:25,989 --> 00:49:27,991
I'm just tired of the whole dating game.

853
00:49:28,075 --> 00:49:31,370
Just say who you are
and be who you say, right?

854
00:49:32,246 --> 00:49:33,956
I can't seem to get it to scan.

855
00:49:34,039 --> 00:49:36,291
My son wants one of those
blue animatronic things.

856
00:49:37,084 --> 00:49:38,544
Can you help me out here?
Do they come in pink?

857
00:49:38,627 --> 00:49:40,087
- My daughter wants pink.
- I'm sorry.

858
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:41,463
What aisle did you find this on?

859
00:49:41,547 --> 00:49:42,631
- I'll take the floor model.
- I was here first.

860
00:49:42,715 --> 00:49:45,676
- There's a line.
- Can I interest you in a Coldy Holdy Ice Bat?

861
00:49:45,801 --> 00:49:47,010
What? Ice Bat?

862
00:49:47,386 --> 00:49:48,679
It comes in pink.

863
00:49:52,975 --> 00:49:54,768
Smurf thief! Stop!

864
00:50:02,735 --> 00:50:06,405
Do I use my grouchiness as a wall
because I'm afraid to be vulnerable?

865
00:50:06,572 --> 00:50:07,865
You bet.

866
00:50:07,990 --> 00:50:09,616
Smurf!

867
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:11,035
But I've got feelings.

868
00:50:11,118 --> 00:50:14,496
No. No, I can't be out already!
What was I thinking?

869
00:50:14,621 --> 00:50:18,208
Wasting my only drop of Smurf essence
on that old hag?

870
00:50:25,549 --> 00:50:27,718
It's a big problem, sir.
We don't seem to have it in stock.

871
00:50:27,801 --> 00:50:31,180
Hey! Keep your smurfs to yourselves!

872
00:50:31,805 --> 00:50:34,850
- Don't you people have any boundaries?
- Grab it!

873
00:50:34,933 --> 00:50:36,477
I'm not a toy!

874
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:37,728
- Where is she?
- Where'd she go?

875
00:50:37,811 --> 00:50:38,854
- There she is!
- There she is!

876
00:50:38,937 --> 00:50:40,314
Hey, this dress is mine!

877
00:50:40,647 --> 00:50:43,025
- Smurfette!
- Wait, I'm shopping.

878
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:45,569
- Let's shop later.
- Go! Come on!

879
00:50:46,779 --> 00:50:48,489
- Patrick! Patrick, help!
- Clumsy, come here!

880
00:50:48,781 --> 00:50:51,784
A giant's after me! She's huge!

881
00:50:52,326 --> 00:50:53,869
Hey, that's mine!

882
00:50:53,994 --> 00:50:56,121
Sorry, little girl, this one's not for...

883
00:50:56,330 --> 00:50:58,123
- Mommy!
- Really?

884
00:50:58,624 --> 00:51:04,254
Don't ever forget that one magical moment
our two worlds met.

885
00:51:04,338 --> 00:51:06,423
And I wasn't grouchy, I wasn't.

886
00:51:08,467 --> 00:51:12,805
Can you just say one thing, please?
I'm dying here.

887
00:51:12,888 --> 00:51:14,223
Hey!

888
00:51:14,556 --> 00:51:16,058
That's one!

889
00:51:16,725 --> 00:51:19,561
Technically, when loading cargo
onto the head of a bear,

890
00:51:19,645 --> 00:51:21,855
- one should distribute the weight...
- Brainy, just pull.

891
00:51:21,939 --> 00:51:25,025
Ahoy, mateys! What are ya waiting for?
We're <i>drawin'</i> a crowd.

892
00:51:25,776 --> 00:51:27,903
- Show-off.
- Oh, dear. They think we're toys.

893
00:51:27,986 --> 00:51:31,115
Hold onto your knickers, boys,
it's about to get grisly.

894
00:51:31,198 --> 00:51:34,576
- Don't let me fall!
- Just hang onto that stargazer, you two!

895
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:35,911
- Hey! Come on, Smurfs!
- They're getting away!

896
00:51:35,994 --> 00:51:37,287
Let's go, go, go!

897
00:51:37,371 --> 00:51:39,498
I'll have you at ramming speed in no time.

898
00:51:39,581 --> 00:51:41,750
- Hold on!
- I think we lost them.

899
00:51:42,626 --> 00:51:44,086
- Again with the head.
- Oh, dear.

900
00:51:44,169 --> 00:51:47,172
- Out of the way or I'll caber toss ya!
- Where did you learn how to drive?

901
00:51:47,256 --> 00:51:49,717
- You think you can do better?
- Yes, I do believe I can do better.

902
00:51:52,386 --> 00:51:54,138
Two more!

903
00:51:54,638 --> 00:51:57,182
- Brainy! Gutsy!
- Papa!

904
00:51:59,435 --> 00:52:00,769
Grace, that's Gargamel!

905
00:52:04,565 --> 00:52:07,526
- Oh, you again! Get your paws off me!
- No, no, no, no.

906
00:52:08,569 --> 00:52:09,945
Bad kitty!

907
00:52:10,404 --> 00:52:11,697
Oh, I hate that cat!

908
00:52:18,579 --> 00:52:19,913
Gargamel.

909
00:52:20,122 --> 00:52:21,623
Smurfette.

910
00:52:21,707 --> 00:52:24,084
More lovely than ever.

911
00:52:24,293 --> 00:52:27,629
Oh, Gargamel,
I guess you've outsmarted us again.

912
00:52:28,756 --> 00:52:30,215
Or not!

913
00:52:31,967 --> 00:52:35,971
Azrael. Azrael, what are you doing?
Get out of my suckamajig!

914
00:52:36,889 --> 00:52:38,432
- Get out!
- Let me help you with that.

915
00:52:39,308 --> 00:52:43,145
Oh, thank you, kind... You! You...

916
00:52:48,192 --> 00:52:49,234
Yahoo!

917
00:52:51,779 --> 00:52:52,946
- Patrick.
- Hey.

918
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:56,158
- Impressive.
- Thanks.

919
00:52:56,241 --> 00:52:57,868
- I'll get the stargazer.
- I'll get the Smurfs.

920
00:53:05,209 --> 00:53:09,171
That's him! He took it right off my back!
Leaf-blower thief!

921
00:53:09,254 --> 00:53:11,006
Please stand up, sir.
You're going downtown.

922
00:53:11,215 --> 00:53:14,468
- Do not resist. Do not resist!
- Unhand me. Unhand me, you heathens!

923
00:53:14,593 --> 00:53:18,680
Or suffer the wrath
of the great and powerful...

924
00:53:25,104 --> 00:53:27,272
Let me... Let me see here...

925
00:53:49,795 --> 00:53:52,256
How can you be the only girl in the village?

926
00:53:52,339 --> 00:53:55,968
Well, see, I wasn't brought
by a stork like the others.

927
00:53:57,136 --> 00:54:00,764
I was created by Gargamel
to trap the other Smurfs.

928
00:54:01,014 --> 00:54:03,851
Wow. And then what happened?

929
00:54:04,143 --> 00:54:05,436
Papa saved me.

930
00:54:05,519 --> 00:54:10,441
He cast a special spell and then helped me
become the Smurf I was meant to be.

931
00:54:11,150 --> 00:54:12,401
No. Play it safe.

932
00:54:17,239 --> 00:54:23,787
"Odile, pending your approval,
it's ready to go to the billboard agency."

933
00:54:26,165 --> 00:54:29,543
Well, here goes nothing.

934
00:54:31,587 --> 00:54:34,798
- Papa should be done by now.
- Yeah. Enough with the suspense.

935
00:54:34,882 --> 00:54:36,925
- I wanna go home.
- Me, too.

936
00:54:37,051 --> 00:54:40,846
Now that that wily wizard's got our scent,
it's a whole new wager.

937
00:54:40,929 --> 00:54:43,807
Without that blue moon,
our giblets are gravy.

938
00:54:46,727 --> 00:54:48,187
Well, it's off.

939
00:54:48,270 --> 00:54:51,607
Time to either celebrate
or file for unemployment.

940
00:54:53,650 --> 00:54:54,777
Hey, what's wrong?

941
00:54:55,069 --> 00:54:56,653
- I'm sure we'll be fine.
- Oh. It's okay.

942
00:54:56,737 --> 00:54:59,281
- That one's hypersmurfilating.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

943
00:54:59,406 --> 00:55:01,325
- It's all this <i>waitin'</i> that's <i>killin'</i> us.
- Yeah.

944
00:55:02,117 --> 00:55:04,036
I know the feeling.

945
00:55:05,579 --> 00:55:07,331
Better yet...

946
00:55:07,581 --> 00:55:09,291
I know the cure.

947
00:55:12,211 --> 00:55:14,588
You just match the colours with the buttons.

948
00:55:23,347 --> 00:55:24,640
You try.

949
00:55:24,723 --> 00:55:27,059
Hey! Go, Grouchy!

950
00:55:27,393 --> 00:55:29,061
- You're good!
- Nice one!

951
00:55:29,770 --> 00:55:32,940
Hey, look at me, guys! I'm shredding!

952
00:55:33,023 --> 00:55:34,191
<i>Walk this way...</i>

953
00:55:34,274 --> 00:55:35,401
You sing.

954
00:55:35,484 --> 00:55:38,529
<i>Talk this way</i>
<i>Just give me a kiss</i>

955
00:55:40,572 --> 00:55:42,032
It's a rock face.

956
00:55:42,741 --> 00:55:44,451
- It's Gene Simmons. He's a...
- Huh?

957
00:55:44,535 --> 00:55:45,577
Never mind.

958
00:55:45,661 --> 00:55:46,995
<i>- Like this</i>
<i>- Like this</i>

959
00:55:50,791 --> 00:55:53,043
<i>Smurfette sweetie is a classy kind of sassy</i>

960
00:55:53,127 --> 00:55:54,962
<i>Little skirts climbing way up her knee</i>

961
00:55:55,045 --> 00:55:57,214
<i>Not another single girl</i>
<i>in the whole smurfin' world</i>

962
00:55:57,297 --> 00:55:59,383
<i>And I can't believe</i>
<i>she's lookin' at me</i>

963
00:55:59,466 --> 00:56:00,551
<i>- It's a complete</i>
<i>- Surrender</i>

964
00:56:00,634 --> 00:56:01,844
<i>- To the power of her</i>
<i>- Gender</i>

965
00:56:01,927 --> 00:56:03,804
<i>So I close my eyes and make a wish</i>

966
00:56:03,887 --> 00:56:04,972
<i>- I just want to</i>
<i>- Savour</i>

967
00:56:05,055 --> 00:56:06,140
<i>- All her smurfberry</i>
<i>- Flavour</i>

968
00:56:06,223 --> 00:56:08,517
<i>So I smurfed her just a little kiss</i>
<i>Like this</i>

969
00:56:14,022 --> 00:56:16,525
- Check out Clumsy.
- Whoa, Clumsy.

970
00:56:16,608 --> 00:56:18,485
- You found your niche.
- Yeah!

971
00:56:18,569 --> 00:56:20,904
Clumsy, <i>holdin'</i> it down. Look at him go!

972
00:56:21,613 --> 00:56:22,948
- Come on, Gutsy!
- Here we go!

973
00:56:23,032 --> 00:56:25,909
Yay, Gutsy! Get down with your bad smurf!

974
00:56:25,993 --> 00:56:27,453
- Go, Gutsy!
- That's right.

975
00:56:29,038 --> 00:56:31,457
- Careful.
- Get your smurf on!

976
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:33,042
- Gutsy!
- Nice!

977
00:56:33,125 --> 00:56:34,793
- Yeah!
- Thank you.

978
00:56:35,002 --> 00:56:36,545
That was rare.

979
00:56:56,273 --> 00:56:59,360
Hey, guys. How do you like my new dress?

980
00:57:00,527 --> 00:57:02,654
Whoa! Is there a draught in here?

981
00:57:02,738 --> 00:57:06,075
Oh, okay, that's not what I had in mind.

982
00:57:07,951 --> 00:57:09,495
Are you <i>thinkin'</i> what I'm thinkin'

983
00:57:09,703 --> 00:57:11,163
Sorry, boys.

984
00:57:12,539 --> 00:57:14,833
Yeah, that cools the giblets.

985
00:57:14,917 --> 00:57:18,462
<i>Nothin'</i> like a cool breeze
through my Enchanted Forest.

986
00:57:24,843 --> 00:57:26,303
- It's approved.
- What?

987
00:57:26,387 --> 00:57:28,389
- She approved it. She approved the ad!
- She loved it?

988
00:57:28,472 --> 00:57:32,309
Well, she said "approved,"
so coming from her, that's love.

989
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:33,936
Oh, my goodness!

990
00:57:34,019 --> 00:57:35,479
- Patrick, yeah!
- You owned it!

991
00:57:35,687 --> 00:57:37,981
Oh, my goodness! Yay, Patrick!

992
00:57:38,816 --> 00:57:40,150
Yeah.

993
00:57:40,776 --> 00:57:42,945
No jumping, no jumping, no jumping.
No jumping, no jumping. Okay.

994
00:57:43,195 --> 00:57:45,698
- Should I send it? I'm not going to.
- Yes! Do it!

995
00:57:45,781 --> 00:57:46,949
- Do it this minute.
- I will do it. All right.

996
00:57:47,032 --> 00:57:48,742
Do it, do it.

997
00:57:48,826 --> 00:57:49,952
Go, go, go!

998
00:57:50,035 --> 00:57:52,663
Tomorrow this'll be on every billboard
in New York City.

999
00:57:52,788 --> 00:57:54,248
It's a go, laddie boy!

1000
00:57:54,790 --> 00:57:57,793
- Well done, Master Winslow.
- Oh! Hey, guys, Papa's back.

1001
00:57:57,876 --> 00:57:59,545
- Papa, are your calculations done?
- Yeah!

1002
00:57:59,837 --> 00:58:01,338
I'm nearly out of smurfberries.

1003
00:58:01,422 --> 00:58:04,758
It's proving more difficult than I'd hoped.

1004
00:58:05,008 --> 00:58:06,802
But we are going home, right?

1005
00:58:06,885 --> 00:58:09,930
Of course. Just not tonight.

1006
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:12,599
Now, off to bed.

1007
00:58:16,937 --> 00:58:20,441
I was hoping I'd be sleeping
in my mushroom tonight.

1008
00:58:20,649 --> 00:58:22,443
I miss the other Smurfs.

1009
00:58:23,152 --> 00:58:24,570
Me, too.

1010
00:58:24,653 --> 00:58:27,114
I've never spent the night away
from home before.

1011
00:58:27,406 --> 00:58:31,744
Well, there was last night.
But who could sleep?

1012
00:58:33,662 --> 00:58:35,831
Hush. Hush now, Smurfs.

1013
00:58:37,166 --> 00:58:39,793
Everything's going to be just fine.

1014
00:58:40,210 --> 00:58:41,462
Papa?

1015
00:58:41,545 --> 00:58:45,966
Do you really believe we're ever gonna
get home to the other Smurfs?

1016
00:58:46,550 --> 00:58:47,968
Don't worry.

1017
00:58:48,052 --> 00:58:50,929
We'll be reunited with the others
soon enough.

1018
00:58:55,476 --> 00:58:58,645
If only the stars would align.

1019
00:59:07,446 --> 00:59:11,075
You know who I miss?
Chef Smurf. Hefty Smurf.

1020
00:59:11,158 --> 00:59:14,286
- Hey, Jokey Smurf.
- Greedy. Narrator.

1021
00:59:14,661 --> 00:59:17,373
- Painter. Baker.
- Harmony.

1022
00:59:17,456 --> 00:59:21,919
Oh, I miss Complimentary Smurf.
He always has such nice things to say.

1023
00:59:22,002 --> 00:59:25,172
I'll tell you who I don't miss,
Passive-Aggressive Smurf.

1024
00:59:25,255 --> 00:59:26,423
- Aye.
- Yeah.

1025
00:59:26,507 --> 00:59:30,052
He's always so nice,
but when he leaves you feel bad.

1026
00:59:31,095 --> 00:59:34,431
Ah, another wretched Smurfless night.

1027
00:59:35,099 --> 00:59:37,726
Oh, hello, little moth.

1028
00:59:37,810 --> 00:59:43,649
Perhaps with your help
I'll find a way to get them back.

1029
00:59:44,358 --> 00:59:47,945
Oh, you and I are kindred spirits, little one.

1030
00:59:48,487 --> 00:59:50,531
Both of us meant to soar.

1031
00:59:50,614 --> 00:59:55,619
Go now, and bring back an army
of mighty eagles to free me.

1032
00:59:56,161 --> 00:59:59,748
Fly, tiny eagle.
Fly and bring back your brethren.

1033
00:59:59,915 --> 01:00:02,084
Fly! Fly!

1034
01:00:02,418 --> 01:00:03,794
Fly!

1035
01:00:08,424 --> 01:00:11,593
Okay. Let's see here.

1036
01:00:11,677 --> 01:00:12,803
Hey.

1037
01:00:13,387 --> 01:00:15,180
I'm guessing you have
a long night ahead of you.

1038
01:00:16,390 --> 01:00:19,685
- You guys drink coffee?
- Is a Smurf's butt blue?

1039
01:00:21,812 --> 01:00:27,526
So tell me, that weird guy
in the ratty bathrobe at the toy store?

1040
01:00:27,609 --> 01:00:30,362
- Gargamel?
- He's not really a wizard, is he?

1041
01:00:30,487 --> 01:00:34,533
Not the smartest of sorcerers,
but dangerous just the same.

1042
01:00:35,242 --> 01:00:36,410
Thank you.

1043
01:00:37,661 --> 01:00:41,331
Back home, I could hold him at bay
with a spell or two.

1044
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:44,126
But here, without my books and potions...

1045
01:00:44,209 --> 01:00:48,922
Well, today we got lucky.
But next time, who knows?

1046
01:00:49,256 --> 01:00:50,466
Well, what are you gonna do?

1047
01:00:50,674 --> 01:00:54,762
I'll do anything and everything I can do
to get my Smurfs home.

1048
01:00:55,554 --> 01:00:58,849
I won't ever give up. They're my family.

1049
01:00:59,349 --> 01:01:01,810
And you never give up on family.

1050
01:01:05,439 --> 01:01:08,484
Doesn't it freak you out sometimes

1051
01:01:09,234 --> 01:01:12,404
having all those little guys
depending on you?

1052
01:01:13,822 --> 01:01:16,116
I mean, what if you screw up?

1053
01:01:17,117 --> 01:01:19,078
How'd you know when you were ready?

1054
01:01:19,453 --> 01:01:21,747
Here. Come sit on Papa's lap.

1055
01:01:23,957 --> 01:01:26,126
Yeah, right. Scratch that.

1056
01:01:26,210 --> 01:01:28,879
- Probably not the best idea.
- Yeah, yeah.

1057
01:01:28,962 --> 01:01:30,422
Let me ask you something.

1058
01:01:31,048 --> 01:01:34,134
Why did you come for us today
when your Grace called?

1059
01:01:34,676 --> 01:01:37,679
She needed me. I could hear it in her voice.

1060
01:01:39,848 --> 01:01:42,142
Well, that's what being a papa is.

1061
01:01:42,226 --> 01:01:44,686
When it comes time, you just do.

1062
01:01:46,146 --> 01:01:49,441
And knowing what to do
doesn't come from up here.

1063
01:01:52,945 --> 01:01:56,573
It comes from here, where it matters most.

1064
01:01:57,783 --> 01:01:59,368
My spleen?

1065
01:01:59,451 --> 01:02:01,745
No, your heart.

1066
01:02:01,829 --> 01:02:06,208
I'm trying to have a moment here,
you whippersnapper.

1067
01:02:10,254 --> 01:02:14,049
- You're a good papa, Papa.
- And you'll be a good one, too.

1068
01:02:32,276 --> 01:02:34,194
Come on, what you doing, man?
Get that weight off there.

1069
01:02:34,278 --> 01:02:36,530
Come on, baby, stop playing.

1070
01:02:37,948 --> 01:02:41,035
Come on, you silly moth.
Where are my eagles?

1071
01:02:42,077 --> 01:02:44,246
You know what happens to people
who sit on my bench?

1072
01:02:44,872 --> 01:02:46,206
Be gone with you, behemoth,

1073
01:02:46,790 --> 01:02:51,128
for I have instructed a moth
to summon forth a gaggle of noble eagles

1074
01:02:51,211 --> 01:02:52,963
to free me from this confine.

1075
01:02:53,714 --> 01:02:55,257
- Get up, Grandpa!
- Hey.

1076
01:02:56,300 --> 01:02:58,218
You see? You see?

1077
01:02:58,302 --> 01:03:01,764
The dungeon isn't built that can hold
the likes of Gargamel.

1078
01:03:01,889 --> 01:03:07,269
Behold my glorious army of... Flies?

1079
01:03:07,352 --> 01:03:10,022
- Flies? I said "to fly." "Fly."
- What is this?

1080
01:03:10,105 --> 01:03:13,776
Not "flies," you light-loving moron.

1081
01:03:14,735 --> 01:03:16,945
All right, up, up, up, bother it all.

1082
01:03:17,112 --> 01:03:20,532
Up! Up, you inglorious devils!

1083
01:03:20,616 --> 01:03:22,826
So long, scallywags!

1084
01:03:25,537 --> 01:03:29,083
Well, don't do it again.
Go around it, go around!

1085
01:03:29,166 --> 01:03:32,503
- Oh, that's nasty.
- Go around it. Stupid flies.

1086
01:03:32,711 --> 01:03:33,962
Wait, take me with you!

1087
01:03:34,046 --> 01:03:36,090
Wait! Wait!

1088
01:03:40,052 --> 01:03:42,596
To my castle for more essence!

1089
01:03:53,732 --> 01:03:55,234
Here they come, here they come.

1090
01:03:58,696 --> 01:04:01,490
- Pretty smurfy, if I do say so myself.
- Yeah.

1091
01:04:01,573 --> 01:04:04,576
Come on, Elway, right over here.
Good boy. Thank you very much.

1092
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:06,537
- Oh, my goodness.
- Here we go.

1093
01:04:07,287 --> 01:04:09,665
- There we are.
- Clumsy.

1094
01:04:09,748 --> 01:04:13,252
- Blue thumbs.
- This is unbelievable.

1095
01:04:13,335 --> 01:04:14,753
I think there's too much pink.

1096
01:04:14,837 --> 01:04:18,257
Just because your name is Grouchy
doesn't mean you always have to be grouchy.

1097
01:04:18,340 --> 01:04:19,675
Yeah, it does.

1098
01:04:19,758 --> 01:04:21,135
- Smurfette.
- Hi.

1099
01:04:21,218 --> 01:04:24,638
- High five. High four.
- High four.

1100
01:04:24,722 --> 01:04:30,269
Great news! The stars have revealed
a perfect time to smurf the blue moon.

1101
01:04:31,895 --> 01:04:34,148
- We're going home! Yay!
- I knew you'd do it, Papa!

1102
01:04:34,231 --> 01:04:35,983
- All right!
- Smurftastic!

1103
01:04:36,066 --> 01:04:37,651
I never doubted it for a second.

1104
01:04:37,735 --> 01:04:41,780
It has to be done tonight,
between first star and high moon.

1105
01:04:41,947 --> 01:04:43,824
That's our only chance.

1106
01:04:43,907 --> 01:04:46,910
But we'll need a magic spell
that works in this realm

1107
01:04:46,994 --> 01:04:48,996
to open the portal home.

1108
01:04:49,079 --> 01:04:52,249
- Master Winslow, a question, please.
- Yeah, shoot.

1109
01:04:52,332 --> 01:04:54,626
Is there a place that sells spells?

1110
01:04:54,710 --> 01:04:55,961
No.

1111
01:04:56,086 --> 01:04:59,506
- Is there a place that proffers potions?
- Yeah, no.

1112
01:04:59,923 --> 01:05:01,884
How about old books?

1113
01:05:02,217 --> 01:05:04,678
Wait, there's an antique book shop
right near where I work.

1114
01:05:04,762 --> 01:05:06,638
- Yes. Dr Wong's. Yeah.
- Dr Wong's something.

1115
01:05:06,722 --> 01:05:10,392
- Perfect. That'll do.
- Oh, hear that, boys? We're almost home.

1116
01:05:10,476 --> 01:05:12,394
- Yeah!
- I love being almost home.

1117
01:05:12,478 --> 01:05:14,480
Hey! Smurf hug!

1118
01:05:16,065 --> 01:05:17,900
Oh, I love you guys!

1119
01:05:18,067 --> 01:05:19,526
Bring it in, big fella.

1120
01:05:19,610 --> 01:05:21,195
- I wouldn't...
- Come on, we know you want to.

1121
01:05:21,278 --> 01:05:22,446
- Yes.
- Yeah, come on, Patrick.

1122
01:05:22,529 --> 01:05:23,947
- If I can do it, you can do it.
- Go on, big fella.

1123
01:05:24,031 --> 01:05:25,532
- Here he comes!
- Smurf hug!

1124
01:05:25,616 --> 01:05:27,743
- We're <i>goin'</i> home!
- Hey there.

1125
01:05:34,416 --> 01:05:36,168
Hey, get up here.

1126
01:05:41,465 --> 01:05:44,051
- That's it, laddie. Nice one.
- What's that?

1127
01:05:44,134 --> 01:05:46,303
Yeah. All of ya. All of ya!

1128
01:05:46,637 --> 01:05:49,473
Oh, look!
We don't have to make a blue moon.

1129
01:05:49,556 --> 01:05:51,266
We've already got one.

1130
01:05:51,517 --> 01:05:52,893
- Really?
- What?

1131
01:05:52,976 --> 01:05:55,979
- Look, guys, right over there.
- No, it isn't.

1132
01:05:56,105 --> 01:05:58,691
It is. Smurfette's right.
Look at the blue moon.

1133
01:06:01,151 --> 01:06:03,445
That's the wrong ad.

1134
01:06:13,997 --> 01:06:15,165
What happened to my office?

1135
01:06:15,374 --> 01:06:18,502
We fixed it for the baby. Another smurf hug!

1136
01:06:18,585 --> 01:06:22,297
No. No, no, no. This isn't happening.
This isn't happening.

1137
01:06:24,216 --> 01:06:26,218
Someone sent this
to the ad agency last night.

1138
01:06:26,301 --> 01:06:27,928
- Who messed with my computer?
- I dunno.

1139
01:06:28,011 --> 01:06:30,764
- None of my Smurfs would...
- Wasn't me.

1140
01:06:34,184 --> 01:06:39,064
I mighta, sorta, tripped.

1141
01:06:39,148 --> 01:06:41,650
Yeah, well, you mighta, sorta,
just got me fired.

1142
01:06:41,942 --> 01:06:43,736
You sent the wrong file.

1143
01:06:43,819 --> 01:06:46,363
- Patrick, it was just an accident.
- What am I supposed to do, Grace?

1144
01:06:46,447 --> 01:06:48,991
You said that they would bring good luck.
This is anything but good.

1145
01:06:49,074 --> 01:06:51,535
I never should've let this happen.
I should've said no.

1146
01:06:51,618 --> 01:06:55,581
I never wanted a house
full of little people running around!

1147
01:06:59,376 --> 01:07:01,128
Blue. Little blue...

1148
01:07:01,378 --> 01:07:02,546
Okay...

1149
01:07:03,714 --> 01:07:04,840
Patrick.

1150
01:07:07,051 --> 01:07:08,218
What are you doing?

1151
01:07:08,302 --> 01:07:10,054
Going to try to save my job.

1152
01:07:10,137 --> 01:07:13,015
We never intended to be a burden,
Master Winslow.

1153
01:07:13,098 --> 01:07:14,975
I'm smurfilly sorry about what I...

1154
01:07:15,059 --> 01:07:19,104
Stop saying "smurf" for everything.
What does that even mean? Smurf!

1155
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:20,856
Smurfitty-smurf-smurf-smurf!

1156
01:07:20,939 --> 01:07:24,318
There's no call
for that kind of language, laddie.

1157
01:07:24,485 --> 01:07:25,527
See?

1158
01:07:26,070 --> 01:07:27,446
Okay, Patrick, wait.

1159
01:07:29,031 --> 01:07:30,783
- Hey, hey!
- Will you...

1160
01:07:30,866 --> 01:07:32,618
- Wait, Patrick.
- Maybe I can try to fix it.

1161
01:07:32,701 --> 01:07:34,036
Just stop and listen to me
for a second, please.

1162
01:07:34,119 --> 01:07:37,039
- What?
- Look, I'm really sorry about your job, okay?

1163
01:07:37,122 --> 01:07:39,166
And I hope that you can straighten that out.

1164
01:07:39,249 --> 01:07:41,668
But you are so not seeing
the big picture here.

1165
01:07:42,461 --> 01:07:45,964
I mean, look around.
Look what's happening right now.

1166
01:07:46,173 --> 01:07:47,341
Of all the people on the planet,

1167
01:07:47,424 --> 01:07:49,843
those magical little creatures came to us.

1168
01:07:49,927 --> 01:07:51,595
They chose us.

1169
01:07:52,346 --> 01:07:55,891
Don't you see
how absolutely amazing that is?

1170
01:07:56,183 --> 01:07:58,435
This is a once-in-a-lifetime thing, Patrick.

1171
01:07:58,519 --> 01:08:00,521
This is our blue moon.

1172
01:08:02,064 --> 01:08:05,317
And if you don't stop
for just a second to see that,

1173
01:08:05,567 --> 01:08:06,985
you're gonna miss it.

1174
01:08:15,327 --> 01:08:16,954
Hey, hey. Taxi!

1175
01:08:17,913 --> 01:08:20,916
Come on! Come on! Blast. Blast you!

1176
01:08:21,166 --> 01:08:24,294
There's got to be some essence
in here somewhere!

1177
01:08:25,003 --> 01:08:26,296
Not now.

1178
01:08:26,588 --> 01:08:28,048
What? What?

1179
01:08:33,220 --> 01:08:36,890
Very, very well done, my little friend.

1180
01:08:38,058 --> 01:08:40,978
And to think, I almost ate you that time.

1181
01:08:42,521 --> 01:08:47,109
Come, Azrael. We must find this Patrick,
the rouge merchant.

1182
01:08:47,317 --> 01:08:50,654
He will lead us to our
elusive little blue quarry.

1183
01:08:50,946 --> 01:08:54,742
Don't you just have a switch or something
to shut them off?

1184
01:08:54,825 --> 01:08:56,660
Tomorrow? Are you kidding me?

1185
01:08:56,744 --> 01:09:00,372
Ron, Ron. If I don't get those ads down now,
I don't have a job tomorrow.

1186
01:09:33,405 --> 01:09:34,948
Smurf me.

1187
01:10:23,372 --> 01:10:25,040
Which way to the bookstore, Brainy?

1188
01:10:25,124 --> 01:10:26,208
According to the searching device,

1189
01:10:26,291 --> 01:10:28,502
we take the F machine
two dots past the red circle to Chinaland.

1190
01:10:28,585 --> 01:10:30,879
- Look out, Brainy.
- "Chinatown," birdbrain.

1191
01:10:30,963 --> 01:10:32,172
- Smurftito, smurftato.
- Here it is.

1192
01:10:32,256 --> 01:10:33,340
- Come on, everybody.
- Let's go, let's go.

1193
01:10:33,424 --> 01:10:35,217
- Mind the gap.
- Wait? Are we sure about this?

1194
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:36,552
- What?
- Jump!

1195
01:10:36,635 --> 01:10:38,429
- Oh, my.
- Not happy.

1196
01:10:40,389 --> 01:10:42,850
Come on, Brainy.
Let's poke around this great steel carriage.

1197
01:10:42,933 --> 01:10:45,185
- Is it safe?
- Of course it is.

1198
01:10:48,564 --> 01:10:50,149
That was great.

1199
01:10:51,191 --> 01:10:53,902
I hope we find this place soon.
I can't see out of this...

1200
01:10:55,863 --> 01:10:57,072
For smurf's sake.

1201
01:10:57,156 --> 01:10:59,366
I thought that's why we left Clumsy behind.

1202
01:10:59,450 --> 01:11:00,743
Oh, it smells like butter in here.

1203
01:11:00,826 --> 01:11:02,745
Where do you suppose
this magic bookstore could be?

1204
01:11:02,828 --> 01:11:04,496
- Wait a minute.
- There it is.

1205
01:11:04,747 --> 01:11:05,998
- It's closed.
- Figures.

1206
01:11:06,248 --> 01:11:08,542
We have to find a way in. Come on.

1207
01:11:15,174 --> 01:11:16,925
I'm <i>gettin'</i> too old for this.

1208
01:11:18,010 --> 01:11:19,261
- Brainy.
- Gutsy.

1209
01:11:19,344 --> 01:11:20,554
All right, everybody.

1210
01:11:20,637 --> 01:11:21,764
- Hey.
- Wow.

1211
01:11:21,847 --> 01:11:22,931
This place looks creepy to me.

1212
01:11:23,015 --> 01:11:24,850
It's not creepy, it's different. And I like it.

1213
01:11:24,933 --> 01:11:27,227
Let's just get the book
and get outta here.

1214
01:11:27,311 --> 01:11:30,773
You're right. This book of spells
is our ticket home.

1215
01:11:32,691 --> 01:11:37,946
I am but a simple wizard with a simple desire,
limitless power and world adulation.

1216
01:11:38,113 --> 01:11:41,158
Now why does it have to be so hard?

1217
01:11:46,955 --> 01:11:50,542
Pardon me. Please, wise sir.
Wise sir. Please, please.

1218
01:11:50,667 --> 01:11:53,212
Wherever did you hear
that ear-damning squall?

1219
01:11:53,337 --> 01:11:54,505
It's your little blue men.

1220
01:11:54,588 --> 01:11:56,882
I saw them going into the bookstore
around the corner.

1221
01:11:59,426 --> 01:12:01,762
You know, that song is really annoying.

1222
01:12:02,596 --> 01:12:05,015
Cautiously excited.

1223
01:12:06,642 --> 01:12:09,561
That's not it. That's not it.
Hey! Oh, no, that's not it.

1224
01:12:09,645 --> 01:12:12,314
Look at all these amazing books.
It's gotta be in here somewhere.

1225
01:12:12,439 --> 01:12:14,900
No, this isn't it.
You see anything, Smurfette?

1226
01:12:15,025 --> 01:12:18,445
<i>Nothin'</i> up here, guys. Look out below!

1227
01:12:18,904 --> 01:12:22,241
- I've got somethin', lads.
- Great job, Gutsy.

1228
01:12:22,324 --> 01:12:24,201
Oh. Nearly there.

1229
01:12:24,785 --> 01:12:30,165
- Well done.
- Just a minute. That's it. There we go.

1230
01:12:30,249 --> 01:12:31,500
Ah, yes.

1231
01:12:31,583 --> 01:12:33,877
<i>"L'Histoire des Schtroumpfs."</i>

1232
01:12:34,837 --> 01:12:36,255
Peyo.

1233
01:12:38,716 --> 01:12:40,884
- That's us.
- Yes, this is the one.

1234
01:12:42,594 --> 01:12:44,763
- Look at that.
- Wow.

1235
01:12:44,888 --> 01:12:46,557
Well, I'll be smurfed.

1236
01:12:47,057 --> 01:12:49,685
The secret runes are hidden in the drawing.

1237
01:12:49,768 --> 01:12:51,353
You see all that in there?

1238
01:12:51,478 --> 01:12:54,148
Look here, at the patterns on this page.

1239
01:13:00,029 --> 01:13:02,031
Openous-lockicuss.

1240
01:13:09,079 --> 01:13:10,497
What?

1241
01:13:16,170 --> 01:13:20,841
You're right, Azrael.
This does have "me" written all over it.

1242
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:31,602
Oh, that's just plain naughty.

1243
01:13:31,977 --> 01:13:37,149
All that remains now is to return
to the waterfall and invoke this spell, tonight.

1244
01:13:37,232 --> 01:13:39,860
- And we can go home?
- And we can go home.

1245
01:13:39,943 --> 01:13:42,071
- Oh, you're going home, all right.
- No.

1246
01:13:42,196 --> 01:13:46,116
To a little place I like to call
BellVeedaRay Castle,

1247
01:13:46,492 --> 01:13:50,245
where your essence shall finally be mine.

1248
01:13:50,871 --> 01:13:52,664
- The dragon wand.
- No!

1249
01:13:52,748 --> 01:13:53,874
It's...

1250
01:13:53,957 --> 01:13:55,751
Oh, please, please, allow me.

1251
01:13:57,252 --> 01:13:59,588
- It's Gargamel!
- Run, Smurfs!

1252
01:14:00,130 --> 01:14:01,548
- Come on, Smurfs!
- Go, go, go!

1253
01:14:01,632 --> 01:14:02,758
Wait for me!

1254
01:14:02,841 --> 01:14:04,927
- To the door!
- Smurfentine! Smurfentine!

1255
01:14:05,010 --> 01:14:06,970
- Hurry!
- Yes, yes, do resist, little Smurfs.

1256
01:14:07,054 --> 01:14:08,222
After all,

1257
01:14:08,305 --> 01:14:11,183
what is the hunt without the thrill!

1258
01:14:15,396 --> 01:14:16,563
No!

1259
01:14:25,322 --> 01:14:26,699
- We gotta go! Move!
- Run!

1260
01:14:26,782 --> 01:14:28,409
- Get goin', Smurfs!
- Faster, faster.

1261
01:14:28,492 --> 01:14:29,576
Let's get outta here.

1262
01:14:29,660 --> 01:14:33,414
Brainy, take the spell, brew the potion
and smurf the moon tonight.

1263
01:14:33,789 --> 01:14:34,998
It has to be tonight.

1264
01:14:35,082 --> 01:14:36,625
Me? Smurf the moon?

1265
01:14:36,709 --> 01:14:38,877
- No, no, I'm not ready.
- You have to be.

1266
01:14:40,129 --> 01:14:42,631
- Go. And no matter what happens...
- Papa?

1267
01:14:42,715 --> 01:14:44,299
...do not come back for me.
- What?

1268
01:14:44,383 --> 01:14:45,676
- Papa, no!
- No!

1269
01:14:45,759 --> 01:14:48,053
- Papa!
- What are you waiting for, Gargamel?

1270
01:14:48,137 --> 01:14:50,556
Come to papa, Papa!

1271
01:14:51,765 --> 01:14:54,059
- Just go!
- Papa!

1272
01:14:54,143 --> 01:14:55,519
- Papa!
- No!

1273
01:14:55,602 --> 01:14:57,062
Keep movin', lass.

1274
01:14:57,229 --> 01:14:59,940
- Do as Papa said.
- Papa!

1275
01:15:00,482 --> 01:15:03,652
Is that all that you've got, Gargamel?

1276
01:15:15,831 --> 01:15:17,541
What's gonna happen to Papa?

1277
01:15:17,624 --> 01:15:21,628
Papa told us to smurf the moon,
and that's exactly what we're gonna do.

1278
01:15:22,004 --> 01:15:23,672
Come on. We don't have much time.

1279
01:15:23,881 --> 01:15:25,174
"Come on"? Come on, where?

1280
01:15:25,299 --> 01:15:27,551
How are we gonna get back to Clumsy?

1281
01:15:29,845 --> 01:15:32,222
We ride. Come on!

1282
01:15:33,307 --> 01:15:35,893
- Be still, bird.
- I don't think they're friendly.

1283
01:15:36,018 --> 01:15:38,103
- Well, neither am I.
- But they carry disease.

1284
01:15:38,854 --> 01:15:41,315
And Smurfs. Let's ride.

1285
01:15:41,398 --> 01:15:43,108
- Whoa, bird, whoa!
- Come on!

1286
01:15:43,192 --> 01:15:45,194
But I'm not sure I can do this.

1287
01:15:46,403 --> 01:15:48,822
You can do it, Brainy. Hold on!

1288
01:15:49,448 --> 01:15:52,701
According to my calculations,
this is dangerous!

1289
01:15:55,079 --> 01:15:56,747
It's getting dark.

1290
01:15:56,830 --> 01:15:59,750
Yeah. Yeah, I think
we'd better go look for them.

1291
01:15:59,833 --> 01:16:01,126
Yeah.

1292
01:16:04,671 --> 01:16:06,090
Hi.

1293
01:16:10,344 --> 01:16:14,264
- Where are the others?
- We think they're still at the bookstore.

1294
01:16:14,932 --> 01:16:17,601
Listen, Grace, I'm...

1295
01:16:22,981 --> 01:16:24,149
Hey, Odile.

1296
01:16:24,316 --> 01:16:26,652
Patrick...

1297
01:16:28,612 --> 01:16:30,948
Listen, listen. Before you fire me,

1298
01:16:31,031 --> 01:16:34,493
I know that the ads that ran
weren't the ads I sent.

1299
01:16:35,786 --> 01:16:39,039
But they're the ads I should have sent.

1300
01:16:39,873 --> 01:16:42,042
The ads I almost did send.

1301
01:16:42,418 --> 01:16:44,795
But I didn't 'cause...

1302
01:16:46,380 --> 01:16:47,756
I second-guessed myself.

1303
01:16:48,549 --> 01:16:53,929
I gave you what I thought you wanted,
instead of what I thought was right.

1304
01:16:56,223 --> 01:16:58,600
But this is right.

1305
01:16:59,017 --> 01:17:01,770
It means something to me and...
I don't know,

1306
01:17:01,854 --> 01:17:04,064
I think it's gonna mean
something to others, too.

1307
01:17:05,816 --> 01:17:11,071
It's not just a moon, Odile, it's a blue moon.

1308
01:17:11,905 --> 01:17:14,074
"Once in a blue moon."

1309
01:17:15,075 --> 01:17:19,705
That means that there are
only a few moments in your life

1310
01:17:19,872 --> 01:17:26,712
when something truly memorable,
truly magical, happens to you.

1311
01:17:28,005 --> 01:17:33,761
And, if you hesitate, if you're afraid,

1312
01:17:35,220 --> 01:17:36,805
you might just miss it.

1313
01:17:38,265 --> 01:17:40,559
<i>That's what that image means.</i>

1314
01:17:41,685 --> 01:17:45,689
Don't let those blue moon moments
pass you by.

1315
01:17:48,942 --> 01:17:52,237
I will call you back to tell you if you're fired.

1316
01:17:58,035 --> 01:18:00,245
I so <i>smurfin'</i> love you.

1317
01:18:03,165 --> 01:18:05,834
Left-left, right! Right-right, bird!

1318
01:18:05,918 --> 01:18:08,379
- Brace for impact!
- The window's open, ya ninny.

1319
01:18:10,005 --> 01:18:11,673
We're outta control!

1320
01:18:12,049 --> 01:18:14,385
Whoa, bird! Watch out for the...

1321
01:18:15,344 --> 01:18:17,221
- That'll do, pigeon.
- Thank you, bird.

1322
01:18:17,304 --> 01:18:19,139
Look! We got the incantation.

1323
01:18:19,223 --> 01:18:21,308
- Where's Papa?
- Gargamel's got him.

1324
01:18:21,433 --> 01:18:23,477
- What?
- Oh, no.

1325
01:18:23,644 --> 01:18:27,147
He took him to some place
called BellVeedaRay Castle.

1326
01:18:27,272 --> 01:18:30,109
- He's gonna...
- Don't say it.

1327
01:18:30,484 --> 01:18:32,444
BellVeedaRay. What is BellVeedaRay?

1328
01:18:32,528 --> 01:18:35,531
Belve... He's taken him
to Belvedere Castle in Central Park.

1329
01:18:35,614 --> 01:18:37,491
To extract his essence.

1330
01:18:37,574 --> 01:18:39,535
- What? Well, we have to go get him.
- Yeah.

1331
01:18:39,618 --> 01:18:41,829
No! Gargamel's more powerful than ever.

1332
01:18:41,912 --> 01:18:44,915
Papa said no matter what happens
we're not to go back for him.

1333
01:18:45,082 --> 01:18:46,500
He's trying to protect us.

1334
01:18:46,583 --> 01:18:50,087
- No! We can't leave Papa behind.
- It was a Smurf promise.

1335
01:18:50,212 --> 01:18:51,588
No, no, no. We can't.

1336
01:18:51,672 --> 01:18:54,633
We promised Papa
we'd do exactly what he said.

1337
01:18:54,717 --> 01:18:56,552
- That's right.
- I didn't.

1338
01:18:58,429 --> 01:19:00,305
I never promised him anything.

1339
01:19:00,556 --> 01:19:04,476
Neither did I. And there is no way
I'm leaving here without Papa.

1340
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:09,064
Patrick, wait. I'm coming with you.

1341
01:19:12,568 --> 01:19:13,944
I'm in.

1342
01:19:17,656 --> 01:19:19,450
Aye. Me, too.

1343
01:19:21,618 --> 01:19:25,748
No Smurf left behind! Not Papa, and not you.

1344
01:19:26,665 --> 01:19:29,668
- All for one and one for Smurf!
- All for one and one for Smurf!

1345
01:19:35,049 --> 01:19:37,926
<i>I'll squeeze a few</i>
<i>And tweeze a few</i>

1346
01:19:38,052 --> 01:19:40,512
<i>And steal their essence blue</i>

1347
01:19:43,724 --> 01:19:47,519
Very impressive, my dear, sweet little Papa!

1348
01:19:51,315 --> 01:19:53,108
Oh, look at this.

1349
01:19:53,692 --> 01:20:00,741
Just a tiny little bit of your little tiny beard
yields me all of this essence.

1350
01:20:01,575 --> 01:20:07,414
Just imagine what I'll be able to harvest
from your entire family of Smurfs.

1351
01:20:07,915 --> 01:20:09,625
Alakazookas!

1352
01:20:12,628 --> 01:20:16,882
Behold my glorious Smurf magic machine!

1353
01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:24,515
No. No! The cages! No! No!

1354
01:20:25,599 --> 01:20:29,186
I'll steam the essence from their sweat.
I'll tug it from their tears!

1355
01:20:29,436 --> 01:20:31,480
I'll snip it from their hair.

1356
01:20:32,731 --> 01:20:34,817
You're a fool, Gargamel.

1357
01:20:34,942 --> 01:20:37,945
My Smurfs are well on their way home
by now.

1358
01:21:03,262 --> 01:21:05,848
Oh, yeah. Let's light this candle.

1359
01:21:12,104 --> 01:21:13,814
Good luck, Gutsy!

1360
01:21:14,523 --> 01:21:18,068
- Into the breach!
- I'll see you there!

1361
01:21:28,620 --> 01:21:32,416
- We all remember the plan, right?
- Let's get our smurf on.

1362
01:21:32,916 --> 01:21:34,168
Brainy, what's happening?

1363
01:21:34,460 --> 01:21:38,255
I've added the ingredients.
It's more powerful than anticipated.

1364
01:21:38,380 --> 01:21:39,840
I don't think I can do it.

1365
01:21:39,923 --> 01:21:43,594
Okay, Brainy, you can do this.
Just say the incantation.

1366
01:22:00,569 --> 01:22:01,945
I'll be smurfed!

1367
01:22:03,238 --> 01:22:07,076
I did it. I did it, Papa! I did it!

1368
01:22:10,579 --> 01:22:13,082
- I don't believe it!
- Wow.

1369
01:22:13,499 --> 01:22:16,126
- It's the Anjelou moon.
- How did she do that?

1370
01:22:16,752 --> 01:22:18,921
- It's beautiful.
- Oh, Odile.

1371
01:22:19,421 --> 01:22:22,049
- Oh, wow.
- That's wonderful.

1372
01:22:30,349 --> 01:22:32,643
Now, I don't want you to worry, Papa.

1373
01:22:32,726 --> 01:22:36,230
That which doesn't kill you
only makes me stronger.

1374
01:22:38,232 --> 01:22:39,775
- Yo!
- Huh?

1375
01:22:40,067 --> 01:22:42,528
Gargamel! Come out and play!

1376
01:22:42,695 --> 01:22:46,323
Oh, I think our tiny little guests
have finally arrived.

1377
01:22:46,657 --> 01:22:47,950
- No!
- Ah, well.

1378
01:22:48,033 --> 01:22:50,494
Enjoy the ride, Papa!

1379
01:22:52,162 --> 01:22:54,164
And remember, keep your hands and feet

1380
01:22:54,248 --> 01:22:57,292
- inside the cart at all times.
- No. No! No!

1381
01:22:57,376 --> 01:22:59,253
Smurfs, run!

1382
01:23:01,004 --> 01:23:02,715
Smurfs.

1383
01:23:08,303 --> 01:23:12,099
You have our Papa. Prepare to get smurfed!

1384
01:23:12,224 --> 01:23:13,892
Yeah, what he said.

1385
01:23:13,976 --> 01:23:15,519
Adorable.

1386
01:23:15,602 --> 01:23:19,231
Two little smurfs come to save
their beloved Papa.

1387
01:23:19,523 --> 01:23:21,066
Hey, Gargamel.

1388
01:23:21,734 --> 01:23:24,486
Make that three little smurfs.

1389
01:23:28,615 --> 01:23:31,493
And I went home and got a few friends.

1390
01:23:52,598 --> 01:23:54,141
My, my, my!

1391
01:23:54,975 --> 01:23:56,602
I think the whole village must be here.

1392
01:23:58,062 --> 01:24:02,691
Whatever will I do with all this essence?

1393
01:24:03,275 --> 01:24:04,651
On me, boys.

1394
01:24:06,195 --> 01:24:07,279
Fire!

1395
01:24:07,363 --> 01:24:09,698
Let's get this hoedown started!

1396
01:24:10,324 --> 01:24:13,369
There comes a time
when every Smurf must stand up...

1397
01:24:13,452 --> 01:24:14,578
Watch it, you little hoodlums!

1398
01:24:14,661 --> 01:24:18,040
...for what is good and cute and blue
in the world.

1399
01:24:18,123 --> 01:24:21,877
And on this brisk New York night,
that time is now.

1400
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:23,629
Hey! Seriously?

1401
01:24:23,712 --> 01:24:26,131
Sorry, it's kind of what I do.

1402
01:24:29,093 --> 01:24:30,594
Eat yolk, Gargamel!

1403
01:24:33,555 --> 01:24:35,140
Patrick, can you do it?

1404
01:24:35,224 --> 01:24:36,266
Go, go, go!

1405
01:24:36,683 --> 01:24:37,976
Hurry, they can't hold out for long.

1406
01:24:40,187 --> 01:24:44,858
You know, one bad apple
can ruin your whole day.

1407
01:24:47,403 --> 01:24:49,196
Full smurf ahead!

1408
01:24:49,446 --> 01:24:50,864
Come on!

1409
01:24:53,075 --> 01:24:56,036
Hey, Gargamel,
here's a little souvenir from the Big Apple.

1410
01:24:59,665 --> 01:25:02,042
- Out of the frying pan...
- And into the...

1411
01:25:02,251 --> 01:25:03,293
- Fire.
- Fire.

1412
01:25:03,377 --> 01:25:05,212
I'm too beautiful to die!

1413
01:25:15,472 --> 01:25:16,515
Oh, Papa.

1414
01:25:16,765 --> 01:25:18,600
No. No, Smurfette.

1415
01:25:18,684 --> 01:25:20,602
What did he do to you?

1416
01:25:20,686 --> 01:25:21,812
You shouldn't have come back for me.

1417
01:25:21,895 --> 01:25:23,897
Papa, I'm getting you out of here right now.

1418
01:25:28,444 --> 01:25:29,486
Smurfette!

1419
01:25:29,570 --> 01:25:31,530
Hang on, Papa, I'll be back.

1420
01:25:35,075 --> 01:25:36,368
Charge!

1421
01:25:36,452 --> 01:25:37,494
Get him!

1422
01:25:37,578 --> 01:25:38,662
Grab the wand!

1423
01:25:38,746 --> 01:25:39,955
- <i>Goin'</i> in!
- Go!

1424
01:25:43,292 --> 01:25:44,334
Bombs away!

1425
01:25:44,418 --> 01:25:46,837
- I'm going for a strike!
- Alakazam!

1426
01:25:48,422 --> 01:25:50,090
- Crikey.
- Look out, Gutsy!

1427
01:25:51,425 --> 01:25:52,801
Oh, ya <i>blinkin'</i> flip!

1428
01:25:56,138 --> 01:25:57,306
Hang on, Papa.

1429
01:26:00,934 --> 01:26:01,977
Onions!

1430
01:26:04,438 --> 01:26:05,606
Get back, cat.

1431
01:26:12,196 --> 01:26:13,489
Here, kitty, kitty...

1432
01:26:16,408 --> 01:26:17,576
Smurfette!

1433
01:26:20,329 --> 01:26:21,580
Looking for me?

1434
01:26:22,081 --> 01:26:23,624
Play time is over!

1435
01:26:24,124 --> 01:26:27,795
Behold the awesome power of me!

1436
01:26:57,533 --> 01:26:58,575
Smurfette?

1437
01:26:58,742 --> 01:27:00,327
Had enough, huh?

1438
01:27:00,661 --> 01:27:01,745
You're mine, kitty.

1439
01:27:05,582 --> 01:27:07,626
I'm done smurfing around.

1440
01:27:17,302 --> 01:27:19,513
You smurfed with the wrong girl.

1441
01:27:23,726 --> 01:27:25,227
- I got you, Greedy.
- Oh, my cupcake!

1442
01:27:29,189 --> 01:27:30,607
What's happening, Papa?

1443
01:27:30,941 --> 01:27:31,984
No!

1444
01:27:33,152 --> 01:27:35,821
Gargamel!

1445
01:27:36,864 --> 01:27:39,616
Not so fast, goody blue-shoes.

1446
01:27:40,117 --> 01:27:41,660
Oh, Papa!

1447
01:27:43,162 --> 01:27:46,707
Now, it's time to break their little blue wills.

1448
01:27:47,166 --> 01:27:50,002
- No.
- Are you watching closely, Smurfs?

1449
01:27:50,294 --> 01:27:53,047
- Papa!
- Your beloved little Papa

1450
01:27:53,130 --> 01:27:56,467
is about to meet his little blue end.

1451
01:27:56,592 --> 01:27:57,634
No!

1452
01:27:57,718 --> 01:27:59,136
Upsy-daisy!

1453
01:27:59,303 --> 01:28:00,971
Oh, no. Papa!

1454
01:28:01,096 --> 01:28:02,139
Papa!

1455
01:28:06,185 --> 01:28:09,271
No! No!

1456
01:28:09,354 --> 01:28:10,439
You again!

1457
01:28:10,522 --> 01:28:11,690
Goodbye!

1458
01:28:12,775 --> 01:28:13,817
I'm really...

1459
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:17,363
This ends here, this ends now!

1460
01:28:17,446 --> 01:28:19,239
...really going to enjoy this.

1461
01:28:19,531 --> 01:28:20,699
Gotcha!

1462
01:28:21,158 --> 01:28:22,785
Freedom!

1463
01:28:22,868 --> 01:28:24,411
Son of a smurf!

1464
01:28:24,620 --> 01:28:25,954
Come back here!

1465
01:28:26,038 --> 01:28:28,165
Go, Gutsy! Yeah!

1466
01:28:29,166 --> 01:28:31,960
Come back here right now with my wand!

1467
01:28:33,337 --> 01:28:35,422
Oh, no. Crikey.

1468
01:28:39,259 --> 01:28:41,387
I... I got it.

1469
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:43,806
- Oh, dear.
- Clumsy.

1470
01:28:43,889 --> 01:28:47,309
- So this is how it ends.
- Our goose is cooked.

1471
01:28:49,978 --> 01:28:52,439
- This is not gonna be good.
- We're doomed.

1472
01:28:53,107 --> 01:28:54,900
I got it! I got it!

1473
01:28:56,193 --> 01:28:58,946
The vision's never been wrong.

1474
01:29:09,289 --> 01:29:10,833
I... I...

1475
01:29:11,709 --> 01:29:13,043
I got it!

1476
01:29:14,962 --> 01:29:17,756
My wand! Give me back my wand!

1477
01:29:32,813 --> 01:29:34,106
How dare you!

1478
01:29:36,150 --> 01:29:40,070
How dare you defy the great and powerful...

1479
01:29:45,117 --> 01:29:46,201
Oh, my God.

1480
01:29:46,285 --> 01:29:47,911
Smurfs!

1481
01:29:52,583 --> 01:29:54,209
Are you dead?

1482
01:29:58,797 --> 01:30:01,050
- Nice one, Clumsy!
- Are you kidding me?

1483
01:30:01,133 --> 01:30:02,718
- Get up here, you!
- Yeah!

1484
01:30:03,469 --> 01:30:06,013
Bravo! <i>Danke schön,</i> Clumsy!

1485
01:30:06,722 --> 01:30:08,265
- Patrick.
- Hey.

1486
01:30:08,682 --> 01:30:12,144
Clumsy! Clumsy! Clumsy! Clumsy!

1487
01:30:14,938 --> 01:30:17,232
Clumsy, you're a hero.

1488
01:30:17,316 --> 01:30:18,525
I'm a hero?

1489
01:30:18,692 --> 01:30:19,860
Yeah. Yeah.

1490
01:30:20,319 --> 01:30:25,157
I'm a hero! I'm so sorry, guys.
Definitely killed the moment.

1491
01:30:25,866 --> 01:30:29,328
- Clumsy, you little mook, you.
- It's Papa.

1492
01:30:30,537 --> 01:30:32,831
I owe you an apology, Clumsy.

1493
01:30:33,207 --> 01:30:36,502
I believed more in a vision than I did in you.

1494
01:30:37,795 --> 01:30:39,671
I'm so proud of you, Clumsy.

1495
01:30:39,963 --> 01:30:41,465
Thanks, Papa.

1496
01:30:42,299 --> 01:30:44,802
I promised myself I wouldn't cry.

1497
01:30:45,094 --> 01:30:47,429
And now to get rid of this!

1498
01:30:52,935 --> 01:30:54,728
To the portal, everyone!
There's no time to spare.

1499
01:30:54,728 --> 01:30:56,397
To the portal, everyone!
There's no time to spare.

1500
01:30:57,022 --> 01:30:59,149
- Smurf y'all later!
- Bye.

1501
01:31:01,527 --> 01:31:03,153
I'm not one for long goodbyes,

1502
01:31:03,237 --> 01:31:06,740
but I did smurf together a few words
I'd like to say.

1503
01:31:06,865 --> 01:31:07,950
- Bye.
- Take care.

1504
01:31:08,033 --> 01:31:11,245
I hated this. So much less than I expected.

1505
01:31:11,578 --> 01:31:15,249
- Bye, Grouchy.
- Don't get me wrong, I still hated it. Just less.

1506
01:31:15,332 --> 01:31:20,504
I'll not soon forget this place.
Especially not with these! Tallyho!

1507
01:31:21,130 --> 01:31:23,924
I shall be back, Broadway. Tootles!

1508
01:31:24,007 --> 01:31:25,884
- Hey, girlfriend.
- Wow.

1509
01:31:26,510 --> 01:31:28,804
I've never had a girlfriend before.

1510
01:31:30,973 --> 01:31:34,309
- I'll never forget you.
- Smurfette.

1511
01:31:35,519 --> 01:31:36,562
High four.

1512
01:31:38,605 --> 01:31:40,357
High four, Grace.

1513
01:31:41,734 --> 01:31:43,610
- Hey, Smurfette.
- And you.

1514
01:31:43,694 --> 01:31:45,779
- Hi.
- You, the little hero, come here.

1515
01:31:46,363 --> 01:31:48,365
Hero? Stop.

1516
01:31:49,074 --> 01:31:51,452
Well, actually, you mind saying
it one more time?

1517
01:31:51,535 --> 01:31:53,120
It's kinda got a nice ring to it.

1518
01:31:58,792 --> 01:32:01,879
- Bye, Grace.
- Well, Master Winslow, thank you.

1519
01:32:02,588 --> 01:32:04,590
- You saved me.
- So long!

1520
01:32:05,132 --> 01:32:06,759
You saved my whole family.

1521
01:32:06,967 --> 01:32:10,095
Actually I think it was the other way around.

1522
01:32:10,554 --> 01:32:14,558
Well, I should get going.
I've got a Smurf village to rebuild.

1523
01:32:14,933 --> 01:32:17,144
Your village has given me some ideas.

1524
01:32:18,395 --> 01:32:19,772
Come here.

1525
01:32:28,822 --> 01:32:30,366
Goodbye, Papa.

1526
01:32:31,116 --> 01:32:33,410
Goodbye, Papa.

1527
01:32:40,376 --> 01:32:41,919
Let's go home.

1528
01:32:45,130 --> 01:32:49,218
And so, the Smurfs left
the strange city of New York,

1529
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:54,098
and I think they left it a little sweeter,
a little wiser,

1530
01:32:54,181 --> 01:32:56,392
a little smurfier.

1531
01:32:56,475 --> 01:32:59,144
And as that portal began to close
for the last time...

1532
01:32:59,228 --> 01:33:01,397
Hey! Seriously, stop!

1533
01:33:02,398 --> 01:33:04,316
Bye, New York!

1534
01:33:14,118 --> 01:33:16,328
It's Odile. Hey, Odile.

1535
01:33:16,412 --> 01:33:18,789
Patrick, I just called to say thank you.

1536
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:22,334
Finally someone has given me what I want.

1537
01:33:30,175 --> 01:33:31,301
I think I'm not fired.

1538
01:33:32,761 --> 01:33:33,804
Wow!

1539
01:33:37,808 --> 01:33:41,437
Wow. So that's a new job, new baby,

1540
01:33:42,980 --> 01:33:45,107
some unique new friends...

1541
01:33:49,903 --> 01:33:52,072
- You know if you really want a bigger place.
- Bigger?

1542
01:33:52,448 --> 01:33:55,451
Are you crazy? Then we'll be further apart.

1543
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:02,082
Grace,

1544
01:34:05,335 --> 01:34:06,670
I smurf you.

1545
01:36:05,831 --> 01:36:08,042
Smurfs. Smurfs!

1546
01:36:12,629 --> 01:36:15,716
I wish I could quit you. Get out of here.

1547
01:36:19,428 --> 01:36:21,138
What are you looking at?

1548
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:25,108
