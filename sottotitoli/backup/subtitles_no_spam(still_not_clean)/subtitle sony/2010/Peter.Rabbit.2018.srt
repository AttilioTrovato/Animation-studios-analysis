00:00:48,163 --> 00:00:49,995

00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:15,589
Sorry!

12
00:01:15,591 --> 00:01:16,623
<i>Yeah, sorry about that.</i>

13
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:19,358
<i>That's not the story
we're telling.</i>

14
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,195
<i>No. We're here
for Peter Rabbit.</i>

15
00:01:23,197 --> 00:01:25,064
<i>The hero of our tale.</i>

16
00:01:26,234 --> 00:01:29,705
<i>A young rabbit in a blue coat
and no pants.</i>

17
00:01:34,809 --> 00:01:37,277
Hey! Pick on someone
your own size.

18
00:01:37,279 --> 00:01:38,345
My pleasure.

19
00:01:38,347 --> 00:01:39,782
I didn't mean me.

20
00:01:51,192 --> 00:01:53,827
Going into his
garden again, I see.

21
00:01:53,829 --> 00:01:56,830
There are safer ways
to get a meal, you know!

22
00:01:56,832 --> 00:01:58,262
Yeah, but they're not as fun.

23
00:01:59,835 --> 00:02:00,968
Oi.

24
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:03,401
What did I tell you about
sneakin' into McGregor's?

25
00:02:03,403 --> 00:02:05,638
Make sure to
get you some cauliflower?

26
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,174
That's a good boy.
Now, off you get.

27
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:12,010
All right,
talk to me, Benjamin.

28
00:02:12,012 --> 00:02:12,912
He's mowed half the lawn,

29
00:02:12,914 --> 00:02:14,850
which maybe gives us
just enough time.

30
00:02:15,649 --> 00:02:16,850
Look at him.

31
00:02:16,852 --> 00:02:18,117
Pure evil.

32
00:02:18,119 --> 00:02:20,118
Even cuts grass angry.

33
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,353
Hey, here's a crazy thought.

34
00:02:21,355 --> 00:02:22,888
What if we don't go in,

35
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,990
because last time,
you almost got caught.

36
00:02:24,992 --> 00:02:26,258
You're so adorable.

37
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,225
I could just eat you up.

38
00:02:27,227 --> 00:02:29,864
That's exactly what
he wants to do to you.

39
00:02:31,698 --> 00:02:33,198
Higher. Higher.

40
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,068
Why are you always on top?

41
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,268
Because I'm the oldest.

42
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,038
We're triplets!

43
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,439
I'm still the oldest.

44
00:02:40,441 --> 00:02:43,409
By 16 seconds.

45
00:02:43,411 --> 00:02:46,177
When's the last time
you brushed your tail?

46
00:02:46,179 --> 00:02:47,845
Whoa!

47
00:02:47,847 --> 00:02:49,348
All right, rest time's over.
Come on.

48
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:50,415
- Yeah.
- Race you.

49
00:02:50,417 --> 00:02:52,417
Not if I race you first.

50
00:02:52,419 --> 00:02:53,851
No fair.

51
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,261
Take it all in

52
00:03:04,263 --> 00:03:08,199
because we're about
to take it all in.

53
00:03:08,201 --> 00:03:11,469
Sorry. I don't know
why I'm so out of shape.

54
00:03:11,471 --> 00:03:12,904
I only eat salad.

55
00:03:12,906 --> 00:03:14,907
It's the dressing.
Get it on the side.

56
00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:16,373
Or just have
a drizzle of lemon.

57
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:18,176
It'll change your life,
trust me.

58
00:03:18,178 --> 00:03:19,812
Right. You all know the drill.

59
00:03:19,814 --> 00:03:21,747
I'm not gonna pretend
that what we're about to do

60
00:03:21,749 --> 00:03:24,314
isn't reckless, foolhardy,
even dangerous.

61
00:03:24,316 --> 00:03:25,449
But we will succeed,

62
00:03:25,451 --> 00:03:27,820
because each of us
plays a vital role

63
00:03:27,822 --> 00:03:30,987
specifically tailored
to our individual talents.

64
00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:33,190
Lookout. Lookout.
Lookout. Lookout.

65
00:03:33,192 --> 00:03:34,224
Hero.

66
00:03:35,361 --> 00:03:36,461
Now let's do this.

67
00:03:36,463 --> 00:03:37,896
Right behind ya.

68
00:03:37,898 --> 00:03:39,029
- Not a chance.
- Why?

69
00:03:39,031 --> 00:03:41,199
Are you afraid I'm gonna get
my foot caught in a trap

70
00:03:41,201 --> 00:03:43,266
and I'll have to gnaw it off, and
then you'll call me "Stumpy"

71
00:03:43,268 --> 00:03:45,938
for the rest of my life, and
I'll have a horrifying scar,

72
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,942
but all the real scars
will be on the inside?

73
00:03:50,844 --> 00:03:52,075
Sorry you had to hear that.

74
00:03:52,077 --> 00:03:54,211
It's okay. We're family.
This is a safe space.

75
00:03:54,213 --> 00:03:56,114
All right, bring it in.

76
00:03:56,116 --> 00:03:57,380
- We all ready?
- Yep.

77
00:03:57,382 --> 00:03:58,883
- Absolutely.
- Always.

78
00:03:58,885 --> 00:04:00,754
- I guess.
- Love you guys.

79
00:04:01,354 --> 00:04:02,690
Now, let's do this.

80
00:04:03,223 --> 00:04:04,455
It's gonna be a fun one.

81
00:04:23,509 --> 00:04:26,275
Lettuce, radishes, radicchio.

82
00:04:26,277 --> 00:04:28,244
I'll tell you
what's "radicchio."

83
00:04:28,246 --> 00:04:31,415
How easy it is to steal
this man's vegetables.

84
00:04:31,417 --> 00:04:35,284
Because "radicchio"
sounds like "ridiculous."

85
00:04:35,286 --> 00:04:36,988
Don't explain the joke.

86
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:41,458
- Flopsy!
- Yeah!

87
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,092
Mopsy!

88
00:04:43,094 --> 00:04:44,097
Cotton-Tail!

89
00:04:47,565 --> 00:04:48,936
I'm good!

90
00:04:54,306 --> 00:04:56,205
Tomayto, tomahto.

91
00:04:56,207 --> 00:04:58,008
Potayto, potahto.

92
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:00,576
No one actually says "potahto,"
have you noticed that?

93
00:05:00,578 --> 00:05:02,044
Stop messing around.

94
00:05:02,046 --> 00:05:03,145
I can mess around all I want.

95
00:05:03,147 --> 00:05:05,347
He can't hear us
over the lawn...

96
00:05:07,152 --> 00:05:08,284
Mower.

97
00:05:15,527 --> 00:05:16,559
Rabbits.

98
00:05:31,476 --> 00:05:32,845
No, no, stop.

99
00:05:51,295 --> 00:05:52,327
- Leave.
- Scram.

100
00:05:52,329 --> 00:05:53,330
Get out of there.

101
00:06:07,478 --> 00:06:08,645
Peter, no.

102
00:06:08,647 --> 00:06:10,178
- I'm gonna put this in there.
- Don't do that.

103
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,647
- You think this is a bad idea?
- Yes, it's a bad idea.

104
00:06:12,649 --> 00:06:14,617
I'm getting mixed signals.
Yes or no?

105
00:06:14,619 --> 00:06:15,552
It's a definite no.

106
00:06:15,554 --> 00:06:17,519
I can't see your
mouth through the gate.

107
00:06:17,521 --> 00:06:19,654
No. No. No. No.

108
00:06:19,656 --> 00:06:21,022
- I think you said yes.
- No.

109
00:06:21,024 --> 00:06:23,524
- I'm going with "yes."
- No, no, Peter.

110
00:06:23,526 --> 00:06:25,293
- What?
- God.

111
00:06:25,295 --> 00:06:26,297
No.

112
00:06:26,631 --> 00:06:27,999
No.

113
00:06:28,398 --> 00:06:30,666
Peter. No!

114
00:06:38,675 --> 00:06:40,846
- Get out of there.
- Ooh.

115
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:44,979
Rabbit, I'm gonna
put you in a pie.

116
00:06:44,981 --> 00:06:46,315
Leave the jacket.

117
00:06:46,317 --> 00:06:48,118
Like I did your dad.

118
00:06:54,658 --> 00:06:56,959
Morning, Mr. McGregor.

119
00:06:56,961 --> 00:06:58,126
It's you.

120
00:06:58,128 --> 00:06:59,994
Beautiful day, isn't it?

121
00:06:59,996 --> 00:07:01,129
Give me that rabbit.

122
00:07:01,131 --> 00:07:03,099
You got a little
something in your...

123
00:07:05,702 --> 00:07:07,071
You're okay.

124
00:07:09,507 --> 00:07:10,876
Are you okay?

125
00:07:11,709 --> 00:07:13,206
Did he just wink?

126
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:15,510
I didn't even know
we could do that.

127
00:07:15,512 --> 00:07:17,011
You look very well.

128
00:07:17,013 --> 00:07:19,146
That vein that's usually bulging out
of your head's really calmed down.

129
00:07:19,148 --> 00:07:20,381
Have you been meditating?

130
00:07:20,383 --> 00:07:22,486
This is my garden.

131
00:07:23,385 --> 00:07:25,052
Let me pass that along.

132
00:07:25,054 --> 00:07:28,355
This is his garden.

133
00:07:28,357 --> 00:07:29,991
There we are.

134
00:07:29,993 --> 00:07:31,191
I think we're
all on the same page.

135
00:07:31,193 --> 00:07:32,994
So these rabbits
will now surrender

136
00:07:32,996 --> 00:07:35,964
their natural instinct
to feed themselves.

137
00:07:35,966 --> 00:07:39,066
Next time will be their last.

138
00:07:39,068 --> 00:07:41,304
I'll be sure to
pass that along, too.

139
00:07:43,306 --> 00:07:45,109
Come on, sweeties.

140
00:07:46,109 --> 00:07:47,008
Come on.

141
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:48,576
<i>This is Bea.</i>

142
00:07:48,578 --> 00:07:52,045
<i>She's next-door neighbor to Mr.
McGregor and the rabbits.</i>

143
00:07:52,047 --> 00:07:53,448
<i>Guess which one
she likes better?</i>

144
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:56,217
Inside. Come on. I'll get
you something to drink.

145
00:07:56,219 --> 00:07:58,052
You must stop going in there.

146
00:07:58,054 --> 00:07:59,924
You almost
got caught this time.

147
00:08:00,357 --> 00:08:01,689
Come here, little one.

148
00:08:01,691 --> 00:08:03,458
Dry you off.

149
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,826
<i>She's an artist.</i>

150
00:08:04,828 --> 00:08:07,494
<i>She moved out to the country
to work on her paintings.</i>

151
00:08:07,496 --> 00:08:11,631
<i>Don't feel bad if you don't
understand them, like them,</i>

152
00:08:11,633 --> 00:08:13,400
<i>even know which way to
look at them.</i>

153
00:08:13,402 --> 00:08:16,504
<i>They are terrible
and she knows it.</i>

154
00:08:16,506 --> 00:08:19,476
<i>So for fun, she's been painting
portraits of the locals.</i>

155
00:08:20,576 --> 00:08:21,609
<i>Beautiful.</i>

156
00:08:21,611 --> 00:08:23,410
<i>But a constant reminder</i>

157
00:08:23,412 --> 00:08:26,149
<i>of what Peter and his family
had gone through.</i>

158
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:36,415
I promise I'll always
be here for you.

159
00:09:36,417 --> 00:09:37,550
<i>And she has,</i>

160
00:09:37,552 --> 00:09:39,488
<i>ever since their mother died.</i>

161
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,292
The rain stopped.

162
00:09:47,728 --> 00:09:49,663
Sorry about Dad's jacket.

163
00:09:49,665 --> 00:09:51,731
I'm sorry you
lost Dad's jacket.

164
00:09:51,733 --> 00:09:52,832
I just said that.

165
00:09:52,834 --> 00:09:54,432
Yeah, but coming
from the oldest,

166
00:09:54,434 --> 00:09:56,870
it just kind of means more.

167
00:09:56,872 --> 00:09:58,269
Just a jacket.

168
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,806
Dad and Mum are still in here.

169
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:03,341
And here. And here.
And here. And here.

170
00:10:03,343 --> 00:10:05,277
But less so with you,
since you're just a cousin,

171
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,212
you know. You're a nephew,
and by marriage.

172
00:10:07,214 --> 00:10:08,682
I'm not taking
anything away, I'm just...

173
00:10:08,684 --> 00:10:10,483
You know,
I want to be accurate.

174
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:13,522
Okay, just promise me
you'll stay out of the garden.

175
00:10:49,891 --> 00:10:51,325
Got it back, Dad.

176
00:10:57,564 --> 00:10:58,666
Got you, rabbit.

177
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,767
I knew you'd come.

178
00:11:03,236 --> 00:11:06,240
The lady's not here
to protect you now.

179
00:11:12,579 --> 00:11:16,116
I've got a hankering
for pie tonight.

180
00:11:16,684 --> 00:11:18,519
Rabbit pie.

181
00:11:30,664 --> 00:11:31,664
What?

182
00:11:37,871 --> 00:11:39,240
What?

183
00:11:41,441 --> 00:11:42,443
Whoa.

184
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:43,807
Is he...

185
00:11:45,644 --> 00:11:47,380
That's pretty conclusive.

186
00:11:48,414 --> 00:11:49,947
Very conclusive.

187
00:11:49,949 --> 00:11:52,318
That means that... That I...

188
00:11:52,718 --> 00:11:53,817
That I...

189
00:11:53,819 --> 00:11:55,686
That I did it. I did it.

190
00:11:55,688 --> 00:11:56,821
- What?
- I did it.

191
00:11:56,823 --> 00:11:59,590
Got rid of him. Who's hungry?
Bite into those guys.

192
00:11:59,592 --> 00:12:01,291
You went into his garden?

193
00:12:01,293 --> 00:12:03,293
No. I went into our garden.

194
00:12:03,295 --> 00:12:04,461
Without lookouts?

195
00:12:04,463 --> 00:12:06,564
That's the sort of thing
that will get someone killed.

196
00:12:06,566 --> 00:12:08,298
And it did.

197
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,834
McGregor's gone?

198
00:12:09,836 --> 00:12:11,301
He's in a better place now.

199
00:12:11,303 --> 00:12:12,570
- Really?
- Yeah.

200
00:12:12,572 --> 00:12:16,373
That ice cream truck
with the flashing lights.

201
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,575
<i>In actuality,
Peter couldn't even claim</i>

202
00:12:18,577 --> 00:12:20,978
<i>that he gave the old man's
heart a fright.</i>

203
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:23,380
<i>Credit for that

204
00:12:23,382 --> 00:12:26,219
<i>of terrible lifestyle choices.</i>

205
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,692
- Wow.
- No way.

206
00:12:35,694 --> 00:12:38,963
All right, this is our land now, so
let's not go crazy straightaway.

207
00:12:38,965 --> 00:12:41,397
It's our job to nurture it,
to sustain it,

208
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:42,767
prepare for the future.

209
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:45,869
With privilege, comes
responsibility...

210
00:12:45,871 --> 00:12:48,704
I'm sorry. I almost got through
that with a straight face.

211
00:12:48,706 --> 00:12:49,708

How are you? So good to see you.

235
00:13:55,874 --> 00:13:56,940
Hey, little rabbit.

236
00:13:56,942 --> 00:13:58,775
Got your land back, I see.

237
00:13:58,777 --> 00:14:00,843
All hail the prodigal son.

238
00:14:00,845 --> 00:14:03,747
- It's no big deal.
- No, no, a very big deal.

239
00:14:03,749 --> 00:14:05,581
You vanquished McGregor.

240
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:07,883
Well, if vanquished
means I said to him,

241
00:14:07,885 --> 00:14:09,485
"I've had enough
of your tyranny."

242
00:14:09,487 --> 00:14:11,587
And he said,
"I will put you in a pie."

243
00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:14,557
And I said, "No, sir.
I will put you in a pie, sir."

244
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:16,561
It doesn't, but thank you for
the party.

245
00:14:17,094 --> 00:14:19,395
Was Pigling eating celery?

246
00:14:19,397 --> 00:14:21,863
It's a shame when you
don't know who you are

247
00:14:21,865 --> 00:14:23,466

248
00:14:24,701 --> 00:14:26,102

249
00:14:26,104 --> 00:14:27,469

00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,615

72.043 degrees.

274
00:15:34,637 --> 00:15:36,773
The angle at which Apollo 13
was launched.

275
00:15:38,441 --> 00:15:40,674
I know, Carlos,
you think I'm crazy.

276
00:15:40,676 --> 00:15:41,842
But the little girl
who wants to be an astronaut

277
00:15:41,844 --> 00:15:45,447
is going to know, and you've
just blown up her dreams.

278
00:15:45,449 --> 00:15:46,481
This is a nightmare.

279
00:15:46,483 --> 00:15:48,949
You've got to toss and fluff,
toss and fluff.

280
00:15:48,951 --> 00:15:50,518
It's the small things.

281
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,920
You mustn't be afraid
to really get in there, gang.

282
00:15:52,922 --> 00:15:55,792
Our toilets should be clean
as a drinking fountain.

283
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,460
Mr. McGregor.

284
00:15:58,462 --> 00:16:00,628
The general manager
has asked to see you.

285
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,529
This is it. My promotion.

286
00:16:02,531 --> 00:16:03,800
They said
it could be this week.

287
00:16:05,801 --> 00:16:06,867
How do I look?

288
00:16:06,869 --> 00:16:08,872
Like a man about to drink
toilet water from a straw?

289
00:16:09,137 --> 00:16:10,204
Perfect.

290
00:16:10,206 --> 00:16:12,841
I have some bad news, Thomas.

291
00:16:12,843 --> 00:16:15,108
- No.
- Your great-uncle passed away.

292
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:16,744
I just received word.

293
00:16:16,746 --> 00:16:19,547
I'm very sorry.

294
00:16:19,549 --> 00:16:21,148
I didn't even know
I had a great-uncle.

295
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,817
What about the promotion?

296
00:16:22,819 --> 00:16:24,718
- Excuse me?
- The associate general manager.

297
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,955
The post I've been working
towards for the last 10 years.

298
00:16:26,957 --> 00:16:30,157
You're in shock, I understand.
In times of grief...

299
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:31,726
No, there's no grief.
I just want to know.

300
00:16:31,728 --> 00:16:33,694
Did I get
the promotion or not?

301
00:16:33,696 --> 00:16:35,963
- No. It went to Bannerman.
- Bannerman?

302
00:16:35,965 --> 00:16:38,599
But he is an imbecile.
I mean, he's not even that.

303
00:16:38,601 --> 00:16:39,566
To be rightfully
called an imbecile,

304
00:16:39,568 --> 00:16:42,168
would be aspirational
for Nigel Bannerman.

305
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:45,571
But he also happens to be the
managing director's nephew.

306
00:16:45,573 --> 00:16:47,909
So you're promoting a
flagrantly unqualified half-wit

307
00:16:47,911 --> 00:16:50,244
to a position of immense importance
based purely on nepotism.

308
00:16:50,246 --> 00:16:51,979
This is Great Britain.

309
00:16:51,981 --> 00:16:54,948
It's practically
written in our charter.

310
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:57,551
You think I want
our best man passed over?

311
00:16:57,553 --> 00:17:00,052
Well, then,
don't pass me over.

312
00:17:00,054 --> 00:17:04,124
This is not the time to be
thinking about work, Thomas.

313
00:17:04,126 --> 00:17:05,292
Take some time.

314
00:17:05,294 --> 00:17:07,226
Take as much time as you like.

315
00:17:07,228 --> 00:17:09,263
No, I don't want time!
I'm sorry.

316
00:17:09,265 --> 00:17:11,697
I don't want... I'm sorry.

317
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:13,266
I want the promotion,
is the thing,

318
00:17:13,268 --> 00:17:14,735
and I deserve the promotion.

319
00:17:14,737 --> 00:17:16,706
Give me the promotion, June,
I won't tell anyone.

320
00:17:17,005 --> 00:17:18,005
Please.

321
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,577
Give me the promotion.

322
00:17:24,145 --> 00:17:25,279
Sorry.

323
00:17:25,281 --> 00:17:26,978
- I'm sorry, sir.
- It's all right.

324
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,484
- Sorry, sir.
- Maybe next time.

325
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,920
What up, McG...

326
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:35,792
Bannerman.

327
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:37,255
Congratulations.

328
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:38,625
I didn't even want it.

329
00:17:38,627 --> 00:17:40,095
I was in Ibiza last night.

330
00:17:41,062 --> 00:17:42,328
Heavy lies the crown, yeah?

331
00:17:44,165 --> 00:17:45,263
Pow.

332
00:17:46,768 --> 00:17:49,036

Get a hobby.

00:18:37,718 --> 00:18:40,852
Might I suggest some time

351
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:42,052
It's calming.

352

00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:46,324
Yeah!

355
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:48,660
One hundred and eighty!

356
00:18:48,662 --> 00:18:50,832
Joust! Joust!
Joust! Joust!

357
00:18:51,031 --> 00:18:52,066
Ooh.

358
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:53,967
Yeah!

359
00:18:55,068 --> 00:18:57,706
Streaker!

360
00:18:58,739 --> 00:19:01,973
Yeah, now it's a party.

361
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:04,580
- Hors d'oeuvres?
- I'll just take one.

362
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:10,750
No, it's hitch kick,
then boogaloo.

363
00:19:10,752 --> 00:19:13,385
When am I going to
get to choreograph?

364
00:19:13,387 --> 00:19:15,086
When you're the oldest.

365
00:19:15,088 --> 00:19:16,755
Aw, I can't wait that long.

366
00:19:16,757 --> 00:19:18,757
Hey, let's go
get Mum and Dad.

367
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:20,191
Where do you want it, Peter?

368
00:19:20,193 --> 00:19:21,358
Anywhere's fine.

369
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,261
I mean, maybe a...
Maybe a little higher?

370
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:26,231
A lit... No, too much.
A little lower.

371
00:19:26,233 --> 00:19:28,703
To the left.
No, to the right.

372
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,368
More. Too far. Lower.

373
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,003
To the right. Up.

374
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,239
Lower. Down.

375
00:19:34,241 --> 00:19:35,406
Right. Right.

376
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:38,042
Lower. Lower. Lower.

377
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:39,711
Up. Middle. Left.

378
00:19:39,713 --> 00:19:41,445
Right. Lower. Up.

379
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:43,348
Your right. My left.

380
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,149
Your down. My up.

381
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:46,417
Left. Right.

382
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:47,754
Perfect.

383
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:50,157
He's gone now, guys.

384
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:53,628
I just wish
you were here to enjoy it.

385
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,797
I'm never letting anyone
take it from us again.

386
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,045
Thomas McGregor?

387
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,714
Sign here, please.

388
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:19,016
From Windermere?
Fancy place, that.

389
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:20,719
I don't know anyone from
Windermere.

390
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:22,019
Well, it's from
Unclaimed Property.

391
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:24,020
Usually means
you've inherited something.

392
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:26,423
<i>Inherited
something, he did.</i>

393
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:28,827
<i>From that great-uncle
he knew nothing about.</i>

394
00:20:28,829 --> 00:20:31,328
<i>Turns out intimacy issues
run in the family.</i>

395
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,798
Windermere?
That's in the country.

396
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,733
Well, fancy country.

397
00:20:34,735 --> 00:20:36,904
The houses there
go for a king's ransom.

398
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:40,136
Ransom enough to
buy my own toy shop?

399
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:41,071
I'd imagine so.

400
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,239
And fill it with the finest
merchandise?

401
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,206
Should do, yeah.

402
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,741
Ransom enough to have
tempered glass shelving

403
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:45,777
and seasonal
window decorations?

404
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:48,377
That I might have to do
some research on, sir.

405
00:20:48,379 --> 00:20:50,183
Can I get back to you
mail-time tomorrow?

406
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:59,322
Round trip to Windermere,
please.

407
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:00,424
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

408
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:03,960
<i>♪ I don't give a damn
what the people say</i>

409
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:06,230
<i>♪ I'm gonna do it my way,
gonna do it my way</i>

410
00:21:06,232 --> 00:21:08,097

and bang, bang, bang</i>

411
00:21:08,099 --> 00:21:10,134

412
00:21:10,136 --> 00:21:12,536
<i>♪ Boom, boom, boom,
and a bang, bang, bang ♪</i>

413
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:14,370
Good evening. Are you
aware of this location?

414
00:21:14,372 --> 00:21:15,873
- The McGregor manor?
- Yes.

415
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,241
- Is that where you're staying?
- It's just temporary.

416
00:21:17,243 --> 00:21:18,841
I am merely appraising
the manor's condition

417
00:21:18,843 --> 00:21:20,510
before putting it
on the market to sell.

418
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,849
But you do want me
to take you there?

419
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:23,980
Yes.

420
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:25,015
- Well, hop in.
- Thank you.

421
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:26,884
I think you're really going
to love living there.

422
00:21:26,886 --> 00:21:28,385
Please don't talk to me
on the drive.

423
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,154
- Give it to me.
- Here.

424
00:21:34,992 --> 00:21:37,863
I can fly!!

425
00:21:39,329 --> 00:21:40,830
I think I cracked a rib.

426
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:42,198
How many ribs do we have?

427
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,066
- Thirteen.
- No way.

428
00:21:44,068 --> 00:21:45,201
Sweet.

429
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:46,536
No, but don't...

430
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:48,040
I can fly...

431
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:53,009
It's nothing against the country.
I just find it disgusting.

432
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:55,278
Yes, you've made that
quite clear on the journey, sir.

433
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,145
I would just like
the record to reflect that.

434
00:21:57,147 --> 00:22:00,148
Well, I shall create a record
and make sure that it reflects it.

435
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:02,451
A human.

436
00:22:02,453 --> 00:22:05,154
Dear. Everybody out! Out!

437
00:22:05,156 --> 00:22:08,825
Get out! Humans are coming!
Human! Human!

438
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,394
You know, it's like, who am I?

439
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:13,496
Who are you? Yeah?

440
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:16,464
You know, like,
we're all connected,

441
00:22:16,466 --> 00:22:17,969
but with what rope?

442
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:22,404
A human! Humans are coming!

443
00:22:22,406 --> 00:22:23,942
- What should we do?
- What?

444
00:22:24,908 --> 00:22:26,474
Everybody hide!

445
00:22:31,348 --> 00:22:33,981
Your quills
are stabbing me.

446
00:22:33,983 --> 00:22:35,286
I wasn't designed for hiding.

447
00:22:45,162 --> 00:22:47,331
Who lives like this?

448
00:22:49,332 --> 00:22:51,098
Hit the lights!

449
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,804
No. Tommy!

450
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:54,871
Tommy, hide!

451
00:22:58,509 --> 00:23:01,142
No, just because
you can't see him,

452
00:23:01,144 --> 00:23:03,510
doesn't mean he can't
see you. Understand?

453
00:23:03,512 --> 00:23:05,818
Now hide!

454
00:23:06,316 --> 00:23:07,182
What? No, Tommy.

455
00:23:07,184 --> 00:23:10,317
Now you're just
posing as a candelabra.

456
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:12,253
Now you're just a tablecloth.

457
00:23:12,255 --> 00:23:13,520
Now you're just a...

458
00:23:13,522 --> 00:23:15,190
What are you?

459
00:23:15,192 --> 00:23:17,158
I'm a lazy Susan.

460
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,162
What?

461
00:23:21,197 --> 00:23:22,432
Tommy! Tommy!

462
00:24:00,703 --> 00:24:02,271
Get... Get out!

463
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:06,910
Get...

464
00:24:08,444 --> 00:24:09,977
Get out!

465
00:24:09,979 --> 00:24:14,183
Every single one of you!
Out, you vermin!

466
00:24:18,722 --> 00:24:20,654
Stay out of my house!

467
00:24:20,656 --> 00:24:22,355
He had the key.

468
00:24:22,357 --> 00:24:24,525
He must be a McGregor.

469
00:24:27,496 --> 00:24:29,296
Headlights.

470
00:24:29,298 --> 00:24:32,298
Felix, blink.
Blink, blink, blink, blink.

471
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,735
Come on, big guy.
Blink, blink, blink.

472
00:24:33,737 --> 00:24:36,036
Headlights.

473
00:24:36,038 --> 00:24:37,274
Come on, deer.

474
00:24:45,314 --> 00:24:47,081
The sun came up again?

475
00:24:47,083 --> 00:24:48,348
I can't believe it!

476
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:50,985
I thought when I closed
my eyes last night,

477
00:24:50,987 --> 00:24:52,019
that that was it!

478
00:24:52,021 --> 00:24:56,390
But we have another day of this!
Whoo-hoo!

479
00:25:06,167 --> 00:25:07,469
It wasn't a nightmare.

480
00:25:11,006 --> 00:25:12,542
It's a nightmare.

481
00:25:37,566 --> 00:25:39,498
What is that music?

482
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,534
I don't know.

483
00:25:40,536 --> 00:25:44,070
But it sounds very dramatic
and life-changing.

484
00:25:56,518 --> 00:25:58,618
Hello, sweeties.

485
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,686
You checking
on the new neighbor?

486
00:26:00,688 --> 00:26:02,421
Don't worry.
He can't be any worse

487
00:26:02,423 --> 00:26:04,993
than the old crab bucket,
rest his soul.

488
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:08,527
Never know, maybe he'll be
a nice, normal man.

489
00:26:08,529 --> 00:26:09,530
He looks nice.

490
00:26:10,131 --> 00:26:11,397
Looks very normal.

491
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,602
That's not very normal, is it?

492
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:16,768
That's normal.

493
00:26:20,607 --> 00:26:22,374
Anyway,
it's gonna be exciting.

494
00:26:22,376 --> 00:26:24,376
We'll have somebody
new around here.

495
00:26:24,378 --> 00:26:26,578
They're not all bad,
I promise.

496
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:27,814
I'll explain it to him.

497
00:26:27,816 --> 00:26:30,151
We all share
our land around here.

498
00:26:33,253 --> 00:26:35,155
I'm gonna give him the benefit
of the doubt.

499
00:26:38,692 --> 00:26:39,792
No.

500
00:26:39,794 --> 00:26:42,364
It's not over. We can
always go in the back...

501
00:26:43,464 --> 00:26:44,529
Or through the...

502
00:26:44,531 --> 00:26:45,533
Or use the...

503
00:26:45,866 --> 00:26:47,364
Or behind the...

504
00:26:47,366 --> 00:26:48,834
I didn't even know
that was a way in.

505
00:26:48,836 --> 00:26:51,470
I see the gates
are back up?

506
00:26:51,472 --> 00:26:54,371
I guess you weren't
the prodigal son after all.

507
00:26:54,373 --> 00:26:56,843
That'll do, pig. That'll do.

508
00:26:56,845 --> 00:26:58,176
It was a fun night, though.

509
00:26:58,178 --> 00:27:00,680
I haven't eaten that much
in a long time.

510
00:27:00,682 --> 00:27:02,715
The diet starts now.

511
00:27:04,317 --> 00:27:05,318
Now.

512
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:08,056
- Now.
- Hey, look.

513
00:27:09,256 --> 00:27:10,425
Now.

514
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:12,524
Hello. Sorry.

515
00:27:12,526 --> 00:27:15,760
I didn't mean to startle you. I'm Bea.
I just live over here.

516
00:27:15,762 --> 00:27:18,130
Hello. I'm Thomas.

517
00:27:18,132 --> 00:27:21,334
I live way over there
in London.

518
00:27:22,335 --> 00:27:23,336
That way.

519
00:27:24,304 --> 00:27:26,470
Yes. I'm just
here temporarily.

520
00:27:26,472 --> 00:27:28,305
I'm fixing up
this place to sell,

521
00:27:28,307 --> 00:27:30,175
using the proceeds
to open my own toy store,

522
00:27:30,177 --> 00:27:31,043
preferably near Harrods

523
00:27:31,045 --> 00:27:33,544
so they can witness
their own downfall.

524
00:27:33,546 --> 00:27:36,247
My. That's a lot
of information right there.

525
00:27:36,249 --> 00:27:37,314
- Sorry.
- Good for you

526
00:27:37,316 --> 00:27:38,283
for not being
afraid to open up.

527
00:27:38,285 --> 00:27:40,685
- What are they saying?
- Shh, I can read lips.

528
00:27:40,687 --> 00:27:42,419
I'm just a little
out of my element.

529
00:27:42,421 --> 00:27:44,656
I think you'll find the elements
here are pretty fabulous.

530
00:27:44,658 --> 00:27:47,625
"I think you'll find
the elephants around here

531
00:27:47,627 --> 00:27:49,563
"are really flatulent."

532
00:27:49,863 --> 00:27:51,094
What?

533
00:27:51,096 --> 00:27:54,365
In my opinion, it's just the
most beautiful place on Earth.

534
00:27:54,367 --> 00:27:56,636
Well, it just got
a lot more beautiful.

535
00:27:57,537 --> 00:27:59,105
Gee.

536
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,372
You didn't just say that.

537
00:28:01,374 --> 00:28:04,111
And clean, sturdy, functional.

538
00:28:04,545 --> 00:28:06,377
The gate.

539
00:28:06,379 --> 00:28:08,880
- Yes.
- I thought you were saying

540
00:28:08,882 --> 00:28:10,414
- I was beautiful.
- Did you...

541
00:28:10,416 --> 00:28:12,717
No, no, no. No,
I wouldn't say that.

542
00:28:12,719 --> 00:28:13,852
I wouldn't say that.

543
00:28:13,854 --> 00:28:16,352
- I would say that. I'm not...
- No, hey, I'm not fishing.

544
00:28:16,354 --> 00:28:17,822
- It's fine.
- You are beautiful.

545
00:28:17,824 --> 00:28:19,391
And you're different
to the gate.

546
00:28:20,928 --> 00:28:23,526
I can't read lips,
but I know her,

547
00:28:23,528 --> 00:28:25,697
and she's telling him
to take down those gates,

548
00:28:25,699 --> 00:28:26,931
and let us into the garden.

549
00:28:26,933 --> 00:28:29,233
Well, enjoy your brief stay.

550
00:28:29,235 --> 00:28:31,937
Just, please, don't be
like the nasty old man

551
00:28:31,939 --> 00:28:33,871
who used to live here.
He was a real twit.

552
00:28:33,873 --> 00:28:35,738
- He was my uncle.
- You didn't let me finish.

553
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,143
He was a real...

554
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:41,645
Sorry, I can't...

555
00:28:41,647 --> 00:28:44,782
No. There's no saving that one.
He was a real twit.

556
00:28:44,784 --> 00:28:45,850
- No offense.
- None taken.

557
00:28:45,852 --> 00:28:48,555
- I never knew him.
- You seem much more reasonable.

558
00:28:48,787 --> 00:28:49,920
Do I?

559
00:28:49,922 --> 00:28:52,922
Although, I must say, these
gates are incredibly sturdy.

560
00:28:52,924 --> 00:28:54,991
Are you expecting
an alien invasion?

561
00:28:54,993 --> 00:28:58,262
I just need to keep the
wildlife out where they belong.

562
00:28:58,264 --> 00:29:00,496
Well, they actually belong
everywhere.

563
00:29:00,498 --> 00:29:02,765
It was kind of their place
first. We're the latecomers.

564
00:29:02,767 --> 00:29:03,734
How long does it take to say,

565
00:29:03,736 --> 00:29:06,437
"Leave the gate open,
and let in the rabbits"?

566
00:29:06,439 --> 00:29:09,305
Leave the gate
open, and let in the rabbits.

567
00:29:09,307 --> 00:29:10,407
I certainly will, madam.

568
00:29:10,409 --> 00:29:12,842
And might I say, those rabbits
are incredibly cute.

569
00:29:12,844 --> 00:29:15,713
Especially the one
with the blue coat. He's my favorite.

570
00:29:15,715 --> 00:29:16,980
And, here's a present.

571
00:29:16,982 --> 00:29:19,452
Wait. Why is she
bringing him a present?

572
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:22,652
How nice of you.

573
00:29:22,654 --> 00:29:24,189
It's for bird-watching.

574
00:29:25,423 --> 00:29:26,425
Thank you.

575
00:29:28,494 --> 00:29:30,526
There's one. It has wings.

576
00:29:30,528 --> 00:29:32,529
Yes, that's a pretty
defining feature

577
00:29:32,531 --> 00:29:34,397
of the bird,
I think you'll find.

578
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:37,332
You spotted your first bird.
Make sure to mark it down later.

579
00:29:37,334 --> 00:29:38,701
Mark it down?

580
00:29:38,703 --> 00:29:42,307
So there's a way of organizing and
documenting the chaos of the sky?

581
00:29:42,474 --> 00:29:43,372
Yes.

582
00:29:43,374 --> 00:29:45,611
Well, it was nice
to meet you, Thomas.

583
00:29:45,977 --> 00:29:47,345
Yes, you, too.

584
00:29:48,647 --> 00:29:51,380
And let's keep this
gate open, shall we,

585
00:29:51,382 --> 00:29:53,448
so the wildlife can run free?

586
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:55,318
- Absolutely.
- She did it.

587
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,688
We're in. Come on.

588
00:30:01,293 --> 00:30:03,361
Maybe it's not so bad here,
after all.

589
00:30:11,769 --> 00:30:13,369
- No.
- I don't care.

590
00:30:13,371 --> 00:30:15,338
- I'm going in.
- Right behind you.

591
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,571
No. Not a chance.

592
00:30:16,573 --> 00:30:18,474
You remember what happened
to Dad, right?

593
00:30:18,476 --> 00:30:19,809
But you go in all the time.

594
00:30:19,811 --> 00:30:21,076
That's my character flaw.

595
00:30:21,078 --> 00:30:22,678
You get your
own character flaw.

596
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,946
- Come on, Benjamin.
- Why does he get to go?

597
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:26,882
Yeah, why do I have to go in?

598
00:30:26,884 --> 00:30:28,484
Because that's
his character flaw.

599
00:30:28,486 --> 00:30:31,986
He goes along with everything I say, no
matter how stupid and reckless it is.

600
00:30:31,988 --> 00:30:34,424
No, I don't!
You're not the boss of me!

601
00:30:34,426 --> 00:30:35,725
- Benjamin.
- Coming!

602
00:30:35,727 --> 00:30:38,794
I can't let him go in by himself.
He's being stupid and reckless.

603
00:30:40,497 --> 00:30:42,330
I hope they're
going to be okay.

604
00:30:42,332 --> 00:30:44,466
They'll be fine, and if not,

605
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:47,503
I guess I'll just be
the new head of the family.

606
00:30:47,505 --> 00:30:50,673
Peter, please be okay!

607
00:30:54,579 --> 00:30:56,678
I'm still
so out of shape.

608
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,848
How's it working with the
putting the dressing on the side?

609
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:02,587
Good. But I don't understand why it's
healthier to drink it all at once.

610
00:31:03,921 --> 00:31:05,289
Disgusting.

611
00:31:05,656 --> 00:31:06,658
Come on.

612
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:35,384
What'd I tell ya?
Easy peasy lemon squeezy.

613
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,356
- Rats.
- Run!

614
00:31:56,439 --> 00:31:57,908
Hello.

615
00:31:59,443 --> 00:32:01,879
This guy is so much faster
than the old one.

616
00:32:13,423 --> 00:32:15,155
I think
we have a problem.

617
00:32:15,157 --> 00:32:17,626
- What is it?
- Everything's upside down.

618
00:32:17,628 --> 00:32:18,629
Where are you?

619
00:32:20,463 --> 00:32:21,995
We never should
have come in the garden.

620
00:32:21,997 --> 00:32:23,563
No guts, no glory.

621
00:32:23,565 --> 00:32:25,665
Are you ever
scared of anything?

622
00:32:25,667 --> 00:32:27,501
Yeah. Dying alone.

623
00:32:27,503 --> 00:32:29,569
That's why I brought you here.

624
00:32:29,571 --> 00:32:32,508
Do you know what we do
with rats in the city?

625
00:32:33,575 --> 00:32:37,646
We find them,
and we exterminate them.

626
00:32:38,948 --> 00:32:39,983
Ha!

627
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:42,651
Benjamin.

628
00:32:48,523 --> 00:32:49,559
Ha!

629
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:03,439
Ha!

630
00:33:05,072 --> 00:33:07,607
- Follow me.
- I can't see anything.

631
00:33:07,609 --> 00:33:10,143
- Follow my voice.
- I can't hear anything!

632
00:33:10,145 --> 00:33:11,211
Follow your heart?

633
00:33:11,213 --> 00:33:12,646
What?

634
00:33:13,582 --> 00:33:14,750
That way, that way, that way.

635
00:33:21,756 --> 00:33:22,758
Play dead.

636
00:33:34,002 --> 00:33:36,135
This is what happens

637
00:33:36,137 --> 00:33:38,972
when you make
a McGregor look foolish

638
00:33:38,974 --> 00:33:40,843
playing carnival games
in the shed.

639
00:33:42,977 --> 00:33:44,277
You see this, everyone?

640
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:46,817
This is what happens!

641
00:33:47,549 --> 00:33:49,982
Why am I talking to wildlife?

642
00:33:49,984 --> 00:33:51,851
I am losing my mind.

643
00:33:51,853 --> 00:33:54,055
I do... They're not
going to respond.

644
00:34:00,995 --> 00:34:01,996
Come on, come on!

645
00:34:07,967 --> 00:34:08,969
Jump!

646
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,299
Okay, okay.
Flopsy, take the bag,

647
00:34:41,301 --> 00:34:43,670
go to the window
and you put it over his head.

648
00:34:43,672 --> 00:34:44,673
Okay.

649
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,808
Mopsy, you take the bag,

650
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:50,975
go over to the window,
put it over his head.

651
00:34:50,977 --> 00:34:51,979
Got it.

652
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:55,782
Cotton-Tail, take the bag...

653
00:34:57,652 --> 00:34:59,587
- Just give him a wet willy.
- Got it.

654
00:36:13,992 --> 00:36:14,994
No!

655
00:36:19,297 --> 00:36:20,364
You okay, big guy?

656
00:36:20,366 --> 00:36:21,999
Close one?

657
00:36:22,001 --> 00:36:22,901
I could've been killed.

658
00:36:22,903 --> 00:36:25,706
And not just me.
What if he got the girls?

659
00:36:26,371 --> 00:36:27,941
This isn't a joke, Peter.

660
00:36:28,273 --> 00:36:29,643
I know.

661
00:36:30,143 --> 00:36:31,144
I'm sorry.

662
00:36:32,978 --> 00:36:34,811
You're all right though,
right?

663
00:36:34,813 --> 00:36:36,280
I got your jacket back.

664
00:36:36,282 --> 00:36:37,948
It's not as symbolic as mine.

665
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:39,282
You know, not being
your dad's and all.

666
00:36:39,284 --> 00:36:42,019
And it's brown, too, which is a
mistake because you're brown.

667
00:36:42,021 --> 00:36:43,753
I mean, brown on brown,
who wears that?

668
00:36:43,755 --> 00:36:45,322
It's a bit matchy-matchy.

669
00:36:45,324 --> 00:36:48,124
Yeah, it's actually
a bit confusing.

670
00:36:48,126 --> 00:36:50,260
Half the time
we think you're naked.

671
00:36:50,262 --> 00:36:51,795
I just look for the buttons.

672
00:36:51,797 --> 00:36:54,164
But then one time,
it was your nipples.

673
00:36:57,936 --> 00:37:00,271
Anyway, you got it back,
and you're okay.

674
00:37:00,273 --> 00:37:02,907
No thanks to him. Look at him.

675
00:37:02,909 --> 00:37:05,174
Skinny bag of wet.

676
00:37:05,176 --> 00:37:07,880
Now, turn around
and drive us home, Eugene.

677
00:37:08,245 --> 00:37:09,947
Here's good.

678
00:37:09,949 --> 00:37:12,082
New to the area.
Probably take the next turn.

679
00:37:12,084 --> 00:37:14,116
Just using more fuel.
Not a surprise

680
00:37:14,118 --> 00:37:16,051
that he's not
environmentally friendly.

681
00:37:16,053 --> 00:37:17,922
Hey, we don't
inherit the Earth,

682
00:37:17,924 --> 00:37:20,724
we borrow it
from our children.

683
00:37:20,726 --> 00:37:23,326
I read that on a plastic cup.

684
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:24,762
If you do a U-turn...

685
00:37:24,764 --> 00:37:26,896
It's actually a safe place
for a U-turn here.

686
00:37:26,898 --> 00:37:27,932
I think that's the...

687
00:37:27,934 --> 00:37:30,466
- Where...
- Where is he taking us?

688
00:37:30,468 --> 00:37:33,303
He's taking us into town.

689
00:37:33,305 --> 00:37:36,940
- So this is London.
- Wow.

690
00:37:36,942 --> 00:37:38,742
Big Ben! Wow!

691
00:37:38,744 --> 00:37:40,078
It's gigantic.

692
00:37:40,947 --> 00:37:42,880
I hope you appreciate this,
Flopsy.

693
00:37:42,882 --> 00:37:45,047
I never got to travel
when I was your age.

694
00:37:45,049 --> 00:37:48,853
What? You were my age,
like, three streets ago.

695
00:37:48,855 --> 00:37:50,221
It goes so fast.

696
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,359
Whoa.

697
00:37:56,361 --> 00:37:58,060
This must be Harrods.

698
00:37:58,062 --> 00:37:59,865
Wow. Classy.

699
00:38:01,466 --> 00:38:02,498
What can I do for you?

700
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,199
I have a vermin problem.

701
00:38:04,201 --> 00:38:05,502
Rabbits, I'm guessing.

702
00:38:05,504 --> 00:38:07,437
- How do you know that?
- You're the new McGregor.

703
00:38:07,439 --> 00:38:09,339
- Bea's neighbor.
- How do you know that?

704
00:38:09,341 --> 00:38:10,975
- She mentioned you.
- She did?

705
00:38:11,509 --> 00:38:12,509
What did she say?

706
00:38:12,511 --> 00:38:14,277
That you want to sell
your house in a hurry

707
00:38:14,279 --> 00:38:16,879
and use the profits
to open your own toy store,

708
00:38:16,881 --> 00:38:18,146
preferably near Harrods,

709
00:38:18,148 --> 00:38:20,315
so they can witness
their own downfall.

710
00:38:20,317 --> 00:38:23,520
That's incredibly specifically
accurate, and a little disappointing.

711
00:38:23,522 --> 00:38:25,288
Who do you think
these guys are?

712
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:26,556
They're wearing aprons,

713
00:38:26,558 --> 00:38:28,524
so that could mean
only one thing.

714
00:38:28,526 --> 00:38:29,992
- They're hedgehogs.
- They're hedgehogs.

715
00:38:31,397 --> 00:38:33,327
Just make sure she doesn't find out
you're launching them rabbits.

716
00:38:33,329 --> 00:38:35,130
She loves 'em. Like family.

717
00:38:35,132 --> 00:38:36,933
Read their lips, Mopsy.

718
00:38:36,935 --> 00:38:38,133
If I was a learned fellow,

719
00:38:38,135 --> 00:38:40,434
I'd say she
anthropomorphizes 'em

720
00:38:40,436 --> 00:38:42,872
in lieu of any genuine
human interaction.

721
00:38:42,874 --> 00:38:44,206
But he's not a learned fellow.

722
00:38:44,208 --> 00:38:46,374
Which is why I think she's just
got a thing for those rabbits.

723
00:38:46,376 --> 00:38:49,410
"Which is why I think she's just
got a thing for most man butts."

724
00:38:50,481 --> 00:38:51,579
What would you suggest?

725
00:38:51,581 --> 00:38:53,250
An electric fence
will keep 'em out.

726
00:38:54,184 --> 00:38:55,186
To launch 'em,

727
00:38:55,952 --> 00:38:57,151
you'll need some firepower.

728
00:38:58,222 --> 00:39:00,354
Firepower seems like...
I don't want to...

729
00:39:00,356 --> 00:39:01,956
Get down.

730
00:39:01,958 --> 00:39:04,059
That's them! I knew it.

731
00:39:04,061 --> 00:39:06,160
Where are you?
I know you're in there.

732
00:39:06,162 --> 00:39:08,298
Come out! I saw you!

733
00:39:12,302 --> 00:39:14,101
Launch them.
I want to launch them.

734
00:39:14,103 --> 00:39:15,773
Right. Follow me.

735
00:39:21,045 --> 00:39:23,412
It's okay. I've got
11 more ribs.

736
00:39:23,414 --> 00:39:25,313
You actually have
13 on each side.

737
00:39:25,315 --> 00:39:26,282
What?

738
00:39:26,284 --> 00:39:27,916
Which is technically 26
because they go...

739
00:39:27,918 --> 00:39:29,517
Now you're down to 19.

740
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:31,186
Again, you push this button.

741
00:39:31,188 --> 00:39:34,020
The signal will travel
through the air to this.

742
00:39:34,022 --> 00:39:35,389
This'll start the spark,

743
00:39:35,391 --> 00:39:37,226
and anything
near it will explode.

744
00:39:37,228 --> 00:39:40,196
I do understand the fundamental
concepts of basic things.

745
00:39:49,004 --> 00:39:50,339
It's tricky. A little bit.

746
00:39:51,574 --> 00:39:52,943
Thank you.

747
00:39:55,478 --> 00:39:57,210
Thank you!

748
00:39:57,212 --> 00:39:58,279
Drive safe!

749
00:39:59,617 --> 00:40:00,749
Just match its speed.

750
00:40:00,751 --> 00:40:04,085
Our natural rabbits' pace
should be able to keep up.

751
00:40:10,661 --> 00:40:13,062
Do you know what?
That would never have worked.

752
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:21,335
Watch it, boxhead!

753
00:40:21,337 --> 00:40:24,138
Leave him alone, babe.
He's just a country bumpkin.

754
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,072
Morons.

755
00:40:25,074 --> 00:40:27,375
"Country bumpkin"?
I'm not a country bumpkin.

756
00:40:27,377 --> 00:40:29,976
I'm from London,
which is where I'd like to...

757
00:40:29,978 --> 00:40:31,415
- Thomas?
- Bea.

758
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:34,917
- Hello.
- Hello.

759
00:40:35,652 --> 00:40:37,384
- How are you?
- I'm very well. You...

760
00:40:37,386 --> 00:40:38,219
What are you doing here?

761
00:40:38,221 --> 00:40:41,291
Just...
Just picking up some, um,

762
00:40:42,324 --> 00:40:43,190
hardware.

763
00:40:43,192 --> 00:40:44,658
- It's lovely to see you.
- What?

764
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:46,527
- Can I offer you a lift?
- Why is she here?

765
00:40:46,529 --> 00:40:48,629
No.
He's stealing her bike.

766
00:40:48,631 --> 00:40:51,364
That's all right. It's more
difficult than I thought it was.

767
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:54,133
No. He's stealing her.

768
00:40:54,135 --> 00:40:55,370
No.

769
00:40:55,372 --> 00:40:58,272
She's going willingly and seems
to be enjoying his company.

770
00:40:58,274 --> 00:40:59,276
Come on, come on.

771
00:41:04,614 --> 00:41:05,982
Come on.

772
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:15,021
That's a lot of smiling.

773
00:41:15,023 --> 00:41:16,423
More than before, even.

774
00:41:16,425 --> 00:41:18,024
She is showing more teeth.

775
00:41:18,026 --> 00:41:19,425
Must mean she likes him.

776
00:41:19,427 --> 00:41:20,694
Aw.

777
00:41:20,696 --> 00:41:22,162
Not "aw."

778
00:41:22,164 --> 00:41:24,699
She doesn't like him.
She's just really nice.

779
00:41:24,701 --> 00:41:27,200
She smiles at us all the time.

780
00:41:27,202 --> 00:41:28,371
Not like that.

781
00:41:37,546 --> 00:41:38,916
Come in.

782
00:41:41,316 --> 00:41:42,920
Would you like
something to drink?

783
00:41:43,318 --> 00:41:44,320
Yes, please.

784
00:41:47,155 --> 00:41:48,387
Are these your paintings?

785
00:41:48,389 --> 00:41:51,157
That's just
a work in progress.

786
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:53,362
No, no, this is,
this is beautiful.

787
00:41:54,162 --> 00:41:55,227
Thank you.

788
00:41:55,229 --> 00:41:57,497
What a majestic
mountain range.

789
00:41:57,499 --> 00:41:59,099
It's an old woman in a hat.

790
00:41:59,101 --> 00:42:01,100
Right. Yeah. There's...
There's the hat.

791
00:42:01,102 --> 00:42:02,702
- That's her eyes.
- Yes.

792
00:42:02,704 --> 00:42:04,370
- And that's her chin.
- It's her foot.

793
00:42:04,372 --> 00:42:05,374
That's her foot.

794
00:42:06,708 --> 00:42:09,608
I'm allergic to
blackberries.

795
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,778
I'm sorry. My throat closes up.

796
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:14,314
Allergic to blackberries?

797
00:42:14,316 --> 00:42:16,316
Is that even a thing?
Is that where we've got to?

798
00:42:16,318 --> 00:42:20,152
I mean, everyone's suddenly
allergic to everything.

799
00:42:20,154 --> 00:42:21,354
Stop using it as a crutch!

800
00:42:21,356 --> 00:42:24,423
You know, some people do have
legitimate medical conditions.

801
00:42:24,425 --> 00:42:25,758
Of course, of course.
It's a real struggle

802
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,060
and my heart goes out to them.

803
00:42:27,062 --> 00:42:29,163
It's very tough, very sad. I
don't want to get any letters.

804
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,765
But this guy, come on!

805
00:42:31,767 --> 00:42:33,398
What about these?

806
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,234
That's just something
I do for fun,

807
00:42:35,236 --> 00:42:37,771
when I'm not focusing
on my real work.

808
00:42:37,773 --> 00:42:39,237
These are beautiful.

809
00:42:39,239 --> 00:42:40,471
You don't have to say that.

810
00:42:40,473 --> 00:42:42,575
I mean, they must be good
if I like them,

811
00:42:42,577 --> 00:42:44,176
given how much I hate rabbits.

812
00:42:44,178 --> 00:42:48,313
I mean, somehow, you managed to make
them look not like the vermin they are.

813
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:50,616
Vermin? Vermin?

814
00:42:50,618 --> 00:42:52,518
- What does "vermin" mean?
- Like a rodent.

815
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:55,654
Rodent? Rodent?

816
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:56,789
What does "rodent" mean?

817
00:42:56,791 --> 00:42:59,123
Like a rat or a mouse.

818
00:42:59,125 --> 00:43:01,395
You think rabbits are vermin?
You're joking, right?

819
00:43:02,831 --> 00:43:05,096
Yes. I'm joking.

820
00:43:05,098 --> 00:43:08,299
'Cause I'm hilarious and
whimsical.

821
00:43:08,301 --> 00:43:11,402
Rabbits are actually
perfect creatures.

822
00:43:11,404 --> 00:43:13,072
They're generous,

823
00:43:13,074 --> 00:43:15,174
honest, pure.

824
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:16,542
You should see the way
they talk to each other.

825
00:43:16,544 --> 00:43:19,078
They do this incredible thing
when they're apologizing.

826
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,478
Rabbits apologize?

827
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,150
They put their heads
together, like this.

828
00:43:24,284 --> 00:43:25,851
No. No, no, no,
don't apologize to him.

829
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:27,685
Why is she apologizing to him?

830
00:43:27,687 --> 00:43:30,157
Why is she apologizing to him?

831
00:43:32,225 --> 00:43:34,860
Wow,
that's taking a long time.

832
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:37,565
She's apologizing
the heck out of that guy.

833
00:43:39,198 --> 00:43:41,833
<i>And this was
only the beginning.</i>

834
00:43:41,835 --> 00:43:45,540
<i>It didn't get any easier for
Peter and the others to stomach.</i>

835
00:43:46,139 --> 00:43:47,442
<i>Or understand.</i>

836
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:49,076
Anyway.

837
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:50,842
You'll see.

838
00:43:50,844 --> 00:43:52,410
You'll grow to love them.

839
00:43:52,412 --> 00:43:55,412
<i>But romance
is a powerful thing.</i>

840
00:43:55,414 --> 00:43:57,715
<i>It can sneak up
on any two people.</i>

841
00:43:57,717 --> 00:44:00,218
<i>Even if one is amazing,</i>

842
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:02,654
<i>and the other is a McGregor.</i>

843
00:44:02,656 --> 00:44:04,455
<i>♪ Girl, I say</i>

844
00:44:04,457 --> 00:44:09,296
<i>♪ If only life would
lean our way</i>

845
00:44:10,597 --> 00:44:14,332
<i>♪ Well, you and me
we'd run away</i>

846
00:44:14,334 --> 00:44:20,138
<i>♪ To be wherever
our adventure awaits</i>

847
00:44:21,307 --> 00:44:24,142
<i>♪ I heard your heart say
love, love, love</i>

848
00:44:25,611 --> 00:44:30,515
<i>♪ I heard your heart say
love, love, love</i>

849
00:44:30,517 --> 00:44:35,419
<i>♪ I heard your heart say
love, love, love</i>

850
00:44:35,421 --> 00:44:38,622
<i>♪ I heard your heart say
love, love, love</i>

851
00:44:38,624 --> 00:44:41,526
And after my parents
died, I was put in a group home.

852
00:44:41,528 --> 00:44:42,493
Peel.

853
00:44:42,495 --> 00:44:44,694
That must have been awfully
traumatic for you.

854
00:44:44,696 --> 00:44:46,229
Did you deal
with it okay? Peel.

855
00:44:46,231 --> 00:44:48,235
Didn't affect me in the
slightest. Peel.

856
00:44:48,834 --> 00:44:50,403
Yes, I can see that.

857
00:44:51,370 --> 00:44:53,236
Maybe I have some tendencies.

858
00:44:53,238 --> 00:44:55,939
Yeah, to commit rabbit-cide.

859
00:44:55,941 --> 00:44:57,441
- Is that a word?
- No.

860
00:44:57,443 --> 00:45:01,246
Well, I think we all have
our tendencies. Peel.

861
00:45:01,648 --> 00:45:02,780
What are yours?

862
00:45:02,782 --> 00:45:04,414
I guess I don't like people

863
00:45:04,416 --> 00:45:06,617
who aren't who
they say they are.

864
00:45:06,619 --> 00:45:08,184
It's more about me.

865
00:45:08,186 --> 00:45:09,286
I keep saying
I'm a real painter,

866
00:45:09,288 --> 00:45:11,954
yet I can't seem
to finish anything real.

867
00:45:11,956 --> 00:45:13,658
But she paints us.

868
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:14,792
We're real.

869
00:45:14,794 --> 00:45:16,760
Aren't we real?

870
00:45:16,762 --> 00:45:18,796
Yep, definitely real.

871
00:45:18,798 --> 00:45:20,765
What do you miss
most about the store?

872
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:23,500
And don't say, "Having
everything in its proper place."

873
00:45:23,502 --> 00:45:24,635
I get it.

874
00:45:24,637 --> 00:45:26,304
You have control issues.

875
00:45:27,206 --> 00:45:28,407
I miss being helpful.

876
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:31,407
A parent or grandparent
comes into the shop

877
00:45:31,409 --> 00:45:34,376
looking for a gift
for the child they love.

878
00:45:34,378 --> 00:45:38,284
I ask a few simple questions, and
know exactly what they need.

879
00:45:40,451 --> 00:45:43,488
I love helping people
get what they want.

880
00:45:43,822 --> 00:45:44,921
You know?

881
00:45:44,923 --> 00:45:47,426
Especially when they don't
even know that they want it.

882
00:45:48,293 --> 00:45:49,428
Those are the best.

883
00:45:51,929 --> 00:45:54,663
Also, neatly arranged displays.
I'm sorry, I can't help it.

884
00:45:56,968 --> 00:45:59,703
Yes! Bananas! I win!

885
00:45:59,705 --> 00:46:01,637
Wait, "taradiddle"
isn't a word.

886
00:46:01,639 --> 00:46:03,973
Yes, it is. It means "fib,"
"pretentious nonsense."

887
00:46:03,975 --> 00:46:08,677
That is exactly the sort of definition
you'd make up for a made-up word.

888
00:46:08,679 --> 00:46:12,585
Mr. McGregor, are you accusing
me of taradiddling?

889
00:46:13,685 --> 00:46:18,587

- Closed.
- Pull up a chair.

899
00:46:52,891 --> 00:46:54,723
We're wearing fur.

900
00:46:54,725 --> 00:46:56,725
- Thank you.
- You're drenched. Sit down.

901
00:46:56,727 --> 00:46:58,359
Let me help you dry off.

902
00:46:58,361 --> 00:46:59,497
Thank you very much.

903
00:47:15,079 --> 00:47:17,816
I could stay here forever.

904
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:20,515
Hiya.

905
00:47:21,985 --> 00:47:23,618
Hello.

906
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:25,952
Haven't seen you
in the longest time.

907
00:47:25,954 --> 00:47:27,923
Meet my new friend, Thomas.

908
00:47:27,925 --> 00:47:30,662
- Would you like to have a hold?
- Among other things.

909
00:47:32,996 --> 00:47:34,897
Look.

910
00:47:34,899 --> 00:47:38,334
My two boys
getting along perfectly.

911
00:47:38,336 --> 00:47:40,803
Nothing could make me happier.

912
00:47:40,805 --> 00:47:42,470
Do you mind if I paint this?

913
00:47:42,472 --> 00:47:44,939
Nothing would make me happier.

914
00:47:51,081 --> 00:47:53,749
You're mine now, rabbit.

915
00:48:08,832 --> 00:48:12,868
Thomas, are your eyes emerald
or sea-foam green?

916
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:15,402
Sea-foam green with a hint
of battleship gray.

917
00:48:15,404 --> 00:48:16,572
I thought so.

918
00:48:23,846 --> 00:48:25,579
Thomas?

919
00:48:25,581 --> 00:48:28,948
And that's what separates us
from the French.

920
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:30,851
Yup. Kiwi green.

921
00:48:30,853 --> 00:48:32,322
You're the professional.

922
00:48:35,558 --> 00:48:36,757
Yay.

923
00:48:36,759 --> 00:48:37,761
Ooh.

924
00:48:38,895 --> 00:48:39,896
Yay.

925
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:41,632
Ooh.

926
00:48:41,931 --> 00:48:43,697
Yay. Ooh.

927
00:48:43,699 --> 00:48:44,931
Yay. Ooh.

928
00:48:44,933 --> 00:48:47,337
Yay. Ooh.

929
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:48,936
Yay.

930
00:48:48,938 --> 00:48:52,572
No, no, no, it's an old woman
in a hat, you see?

931
00:48:53,876 --> 00:48:56,746
I just assumed she would've
reentered at that exact moment.

932
00:49:10,692 --> 00:49:12,058
You need to stop.

933
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:13,630
It's not going to end well.

934
00:49:14,129 --> 00:49:15,632
I think I found it.

935
00:49:17,031 --> 00:49:18,401
The perfect ma...

936
00:49:19,033 --> 00:49:20,535
My painting!

937
00:49:28,042 --> 00:49:29,308
It's ruined.

938
00:49:29,310 --> 00:49:32,178
You know how uncontrollable
wildlife can be. I just...

939
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:34,147
- Bad rabbit. Bad rabbit!
- Yes, bad rabbit.

940
00:49:34,149 --> 00:49:35,515
- Naughty.
- Bad rabbit!

941
00:49:35,517 --> 00:49:36,950
- Out, get out.
- Out.

942
00:49:36,952 --> 00:49:39,051
I said, shoo. Shoo!

943
00:49:39,053 --> 00:49:40,423
Get out of here!

944
00:49:41,189 --> 00:49:43,957
I'm so sorry.
He just went mad.

945
00:49:43,959 --> 00:49:44,961
Are you all right?

946
00:49:50,799 --> 00:49:51,934
He's gotta go.

947
00:49:52,999 --> 00:49:54,134
No way!

948
00:49:54,136 --> 00:49:56,203
The sun came up again!

949
00:49:56,205 --> 00:49:58,538
If I knew this was
gonna keep happening,

950
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:00,707
certainly wouldn't have
fertilized all those eggs!

951
00:50:00,709 --> 00:50:03,576
Now I have to stick around
till they hatch!

952
00:50:03,578 --> 00:50:07,649
And be present and involved!

953
00:50:09,517 --> 00:50:10,750

pull it back,

00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:06,271
and picture the one face you'd
most like to see get hit.

00:51:06,273 --> 00:51:08,740
Ooh. Got someone.

975
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:11,913

He's got to go.

983
00:52:10,871 --> 00:52:13,303
His face was so
classic. He was like...

984
00:52:15,075 --> 00:52:16,341
All of the rakes. I mean,

985
00:52:16,343 --> 00:52:18,208
I didn't even think
it would work that well.

986
00:52:18,210 --> 00:52:20,944
It was right on the edge
of believability.

987
00:52:20,946 --> 00:52:22,013
You guys.

988
00:52:22,015 --> 00:52:24,315
How did you even get that
wheelbarrow up there?

989
00:52:25,884 --> 00:52:28,319
It was a perfectly crafted
sequence.

990
00:52:28,321 --> 00:52:29,219
Now listen.

991
00:52:29,221 --> 00:52:31,688
We've got him
just where we want him.

992
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:33,824
It's on to the next phase.

993
00:52:33,826 --> 00:52:35,629
That might not be possible.

994
00:52:45,204 --> 00:52:47,575
That's a serious
electric fence.

995
00:52:48,741 --> 00:52:50,875
Why is he feeding it
peanut butter?

996
00:52:50,877 --> 00:52:51,941
Yummy.

997
00:52:51,943 --> 00:52:53,846
He's trying to bait us
into touching it.

998
00:52:55,014 --> 00:52:57,014
What happens if we touch it?

999
00:52:57,016 --> 00:52:58,948
We're about to find out.

1000
00:52:59,985 --> 00:53:02,654
No, Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle!
Stop! No.

1001
00:53:02,656 --> 00:53:04,922
I'm four and a half years old.

1002
00:53:04,924 --> 00:53:07,692
I need some excitement
before I check out.

1003
00:53:07,694 --> 00:53:09,694
- Don't do it!
- No, Tiggy-Winkle, stop!

1004
00:53:09,696 --> 00:53:11,632
Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle,
it's not worth it!

1005
00:53:22,141 --> 00:53:23,142
Look away.

1006
00:53:24,443 --> 00:53:26,008
Guys, I have an idea.

1007
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:28,010
You remember what
Dad used to say to us?

1008
00:53:28,012 --> 00:53:31,882
"Never go into
McGregor's garden."

1009
00:53:31,884 --> 00:53:33,917
Yeah, but what else
did he say to us?

1010
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:36,419
Don't electrify
a lady hedgehog.

1011
00:53:36,421 --> 00:53:40,023
Maybe we should rethink some of
the other stuff Dad said to us.

1012
00:53:40,025 --> 00:53:43,894
Yeah, like, "You can't
put lipstick on a pig."

1013
00:53:43,896 --> 00:53:46,229
- No, no, no, no.
- This is lip balm.

1014
00:53:46,231 --> 00:53:49,166
It's cherry flavor, so it
might appear to be lipstick,

1015
00:53:49,168 --> 00:53:50,903
but this is lip balm.

1016
00:53:53,137 --> 00:53:55,771
Yes, yes, yes.
Okay, he also used to say,

1017
00:53:55,773 --> 00:53:57,773
"You can't out-clever a fox,

1018
00:53:57,775 --> 00:54:00,042
"so use his cleverness against him."

1019
00:54:00,044 --> 00:54:02,782
Come on, Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle!
That's enough!

you did it again, Peter.

Yeah, I felt brain.

1044
00:56:12,976 --> 00:56:15,309
Now, if history is any
indication,

1045
00:56:15,311 --> 00:56:18,312
that ice cream truck with the
lights'll take him away.

00:57:20,009 --> 00:57:21,077
Yeah?

1057
00:57:22,078 --> 00:57:24,244
What are you doing
out in the garden so late?

1058
00:57:26,382 --> 00:57:28,514
I'm picking wildflowers.

1059
00:57:30,953 --> 00:57:32,585
It's for you.

1060
00:57:32,587 --> 00:57:34,121
He's come back to life.

1061
00:57:34,123 --> 00:57:35,656
With a light on his head.

1062
00:57:35,658 --> 00:57:37,092
He's evolving.

1063
00:57:38,226 --> 00:57:40,263
What were you doing
out in the garden?

1064
00:57:41,130 --> 00:57:41,993
Doing?

1065
00:57:41,995 --> 00:57:43,232
Yeah. By the tree.

1066
00:57:44,132 --> 00:57:46,199
"Doing" can mean
so many things, can't it?

1067
00:57:46,201 --> 00:57:48,268
- I mean, I was, I was...
- Would you mind?

1068
00:57:48,270 --> 00:57:50,536
- It's just awfully bright.
- I was do... Is it?

1069
00:57:50,538 --> 00:57:53,206
Is it distracting you from what
you were asking me just then?

1070
00:57:53,208 --> 00:57:54,106
Is it better down?

1071
00:57:54,108 --> 00:57:56,178
Up. Up. It's quite bright.

1072
00:57:56,977 --> 00:57:59,378
And so we advance to endgame.

1073
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:01,046
You sure you know
what you're doing?

1074
00:58:01,048 --> 00:58:03,282
What? We're tryin' to get
our garden back.

1075
00:58:03,284 --> 00:58:05,017
Is that really
what this is all about?

1076
00:58:05,019 --> 00:58:06,084
Of course,
that's what it's about.

1077
00:58:06,086 --> 00:58:08,487
You think I've got some
kind of ulterior motive,

1078
00:58:08,489 --> 00:58:12,258
that I'm harboring some kind of
emotional connection to her,

1079
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:14,260
because of losing
my own mother and father

1080
00:58:14,262 --> 00:58:16,227
and I think if she goes,
what have I got?

1081
00:58:16,229 --> 00:58:17,296
It's only about the garden,

1082
00:58:17,298 --> 00:58:19,699
and I don't know what's
happened to my voice. It...

1083
00:58:19,701 --> 00:58:21,366
It shouldn't be this high.

1084
00:58:21,368 --> 00:58:22,536
It should be lower.

1085
00:58:22,538 --> 00:58:24,136
It should be lower.

1086
00:58:24,138 --> 00:58:26,472
I love her like a mother.

1087
00:58:26,474 --> 00:58:28,173
Yes, that was very convincing.

1088
00:58:28,175 --> 00:58:30,176
It's only about the garden.

1089
00:58:30,178 --> 00:58:31,077
Yes, it is.

1090
00:58:31,079 --> 00:58:32,345
I'm stuck. My voice is stuck.

1091
00:58:32,347 --> 00:58:33,578
- Cotton-Tail, can you just...
- Yeah.

1092
00:58:34,717 --> 00:58:36,218
Thank you. Let's do this.

1093
00:58:37,151 --> 00:58:38,353
- Nice to see you.
- Thank you.

1094
00:58:42,457 --> 00:58:45,024
I'm not sure I want to be
part of this anymore.

1095
00:58:45,026 --> 00:58:46,258
Of course, you do.

1096
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:48,361
Just do what I say.
It will all work out.

1097
00:58:48,363 --> 00:58:49,461
"Like always?"

1098
00:58:49,463 --> 00:58:52,430
Said the rabbit who almost
got thrown into a river.

1099
00:58:52,432 --> 00:58:53,434
Trust me.

1100
00:58:56,303 --> 00:58:57,305
I got this.

1101
00:59:17,258 --> 00:59:18,524
Cotton-Tail, go.

1102
00:59:27,434 --> 00:59:28,436
Hello?

1103
00:59:30,203 --> 00:59:32,738
Ready. Aim. Hold it.

1104
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:34,673
Hold it.

1105
00:59:34,675 --> 00:59:36,106
- Thomas.
- Fire!

1106
00:59:37,512 --> 00:59:40,478
- Morning.
- You fancy a spot of lunch later?

1107
00:59:41,582 --> 00:59:44,081
Yes. That...
Lunch would be lovely.

1108
00:59:44,083 --> 00:59:45,651
I was thinking of
making a salad.

1109
00:59:45,653 --> 00:59:46,819
Yeah.

1110
00:59:46,821 --> 00:59:48,522
Or maybe a soup.
What would you prefer?

1111
00:59:50,658 --> 00:59:52,123
Let me think. Soup. Soup.

1112
00:59:52,125 --> 00:59:54,592
Would you like water,
or sparkling water, or...

1113
00:59:54,594 --> 00:59:57,098
Would you just
pick one, please?

1114
00:59:59,132 --> 01:00:01,733
Look at you, you're doing
your relaxation pose.

1115
01:00:01,735 --> 01:00:03,836
- Arms up.
- Yeah. What?

1116
01:00:03,838 --> 01:00:06,271
- Arms up.
- Really? Up?

1117
01:00:06,273 --> 01:00:08,505
- Yep, up they go.
- You know where to aim.

1118
01:00:08,507 --> 01:00:09,509
All right.

1119
01:00:15,148 --> 01:00:17,614
- You look really relaxed.
- So relaxed.

1120
01:00:17,616 --> 01:00:19,083
Just going to
do some painting.

1121
01:00:19,085 --> 01:00:20,284
Blackberries. Blackberries!

1122
01:00:20,286 --> 01:00:23,290
No, but he's allergic to...
Clever.

1123
01:00:23,824 --> 01:00:26,157
Shoot for the mouth.

1124
01:00:26,159 --> 01:00:28,693
I might put some music on.
I hope it's not too loud.

1125
01:00:28,695 --> 01:00:30,427
Get in there and create!

1126
01:00:30,429 --> 01:00:32,096
I'm out.

1127
01:00:32,098 --> 01:00:33,465
- Flopsy.
- Visualize the face.

1128
01:00:33,467 --> 01:00:35,567
Look at my face.
Turn his face into my face.

1129
01:00:35,569 --> 01:00:37,701
Now stop looking at my face
and look at his face,

1130
01:00:37,703 --> 01:00:39,439
but see my face, and fire!

1131
01:00:39,873 --> 01:00:41,472
- Yes!
- Flopsy!

1132
01:00:43,109 --> 01:00:44,378
Blackberries.

1133
01:00:52,819 --> 01:00:54,187
Ooh.

1134
01:01:01,392 --> 01:01:02,394
That should do it.

1135
01:01:03,797 --> 01:01:04,695
What?

1136
01:01:04,697 --> 01:01:06,731
This guy's like
some kind of sorcerer.

1137
01:01:06,733 --> 01:01:08,068
That's it.

1138
01:01:24,216 --> 01:01:26,216
This is starting to
get out of control.

1139
01:01:26,218 --> 01:01:27,584
No, no, this is perfect.

1140
01:01:27,586 --> 01:01:28,752
Remember your training.

1141
01:01:28,754 --> 01:01:30,423
Wait, did we train for this?

1142
01:01:33,758 --> 01:01:35,360
Whoa!

1143
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:44,368
How is this perfect?

1144
01:01:44,370 --> 01:01:46,335
She should've heard us by now.

1145
01:01:46,337 --> 01:01:48,738
<i>♪ This is my fight song</i>

1146
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:51,375
<i>♪ Take back my life song</i>

1147
01:01:51,377 --> 01:01:53,580
<i>♪ Prove I'm all right song</i>

1148
01:01:58,517 --> 01:01:59,549
I'm hit.

1149
01:01:59,551 --> 01:02:01,484
- I'm hit.
- Mopsy!

1150
01:02:01,486 --> 01:02:02,518
No!

1151
01:02:06,558 --> 01:02:09,258
Flopsy, I need you
to know something.

1152
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:10,526
I'm not the oldest.

1153
01:02:10,528 --> 01:02:13,763
- What?
- You were always so cute and lovable.

1154
01:02:13,765 --> 01:02:15,698
And Cotton-Tail,
well, she's...

1155
01:02:20,505 --> 01:02:21,438
Cotton-Tail,

1156
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:24,539
so Mum and Dad told us
I was the oldest,

1157
01:02:24,541 --> 01:02:25,941
so I had something.

1158
01:02:25,943 --> 01:02:28,277
But, really,
you're the oldest,

1159
01:02:28,279 --> 01:02:30,545
and I'm nothing.

1160
01:02:30,547 --> 01:02:32,617
No! Mopsy, don't go.

1161
01:02:33,351 --> 01:02:34,684
Mopsy?

1162
01:02:39,857 --> 01:02:42,926
It was just a tomato.
I'm fine.

1163
01:02:42,928 --> 01:02:44,793
Guys, I'm fine!

1164
01:02:44,795 --> 01:02:46,929
It's just a tomato!

1165
01:02:46,931 --> 01:02:49,465
Hey, you never heard
any of that stuff, got me?

1166
01:02:51,635 --> 01:02:52,767
Dink.

1167
01:03:10,454 --> 01:03:11,854
<i>♪ Fight left in me ♪</i>

1168
01:03:13,991 --> 01:03:16,295
Gotcha! You listen to me.

1169
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:18,993
I am not a bad guy.

1170
01:03:18,995 --> 01:03:20,595
You turned me into this.

1171
01:03:20,597 --> 01:03:22,430
I am a nice person.

1172
01:03:22,432 --> 01:03:24,666
I've chilled out, man.

1173
01:03:24,668 --> 01:03:26,000
I'm cool now.

1174
01:03:26,002 --> 01:03:29,671
I've evolved, but you,
you're still the same.

1175
01:03:29,673 --> 01:03:31,673
Still full of mischief.

1176
01:03:31,675 --> 01:03:35,410
And that's why things are not
going to end well for you.

1177
01:03:35,412 --> 01:03:39,446
Because you poked at me
and you poked at me,

1178
01:03:39,448 --> 01:03:42,751
until all that's left
for me to do is wring your...

1179
01:03:42,753 --> 01:03:43,853
What's going on here?

1180
01:03:43,855 --> 01:03:45,953
You've got to chew your food!

1181
01:03:45,955 --> 01:03:47,690
I saved him.

1182
01:03:47,692 --> 01:03:48,989
What happened? Is he okay?

1183
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:50,091
Yeah, I... He...

1184
01:03:50,093 --> 01:03:52,594
The poor little guy,
he was choking on some radish.

1185
01:03:52,596 --> 01:03:54,629
So I just...
I've checked his pulse,

1186
01:03:54,631 --> 01:03:56,397
and everything's
gonna be okay.

1187
01:03:56,399 --> 01:03:58,699
You're going to be okay!

1188
01:03:58,701 --> 01:04:01,871
So off you go. Off you go.
There we are.

1189
01:04:03,907 --> 01:04:05,242
It's a miracle.

1190
01:04:05,575 --> 01:04:06,373
Yeah.

1191
01:04:06,375 --> 01:04:08,810
I thought I heard
some loud noises.

1192
01:04:08,812 --> 01:04:09,844
It was a bit of a ruckus.

1193
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:12,047
I was painting, so I can't
be sure, but did you...

1194
01:04:12,049 --> 01:04:14,616
No, I don't think so...
I was weeding.

1195
01:04:14,618 --> 01:04:17,919
I do make grunting noises when
I weed sometimes.

1196
01:04:17,921 --> 01:04:20,888
It's just people have used explosives
before to keep the rabbits out.

1197
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:21,922
Explosives?

1198
01:04:21,924 --> 01:04:22,990
But you wouldn't do that.

1199
01:04:22,992 --> 01:04:24,057
I wouldn't do
something like that.

1200
01:04:24,059 --> 01:04:25,460
- No, of course not.
- They're angels.

1201
01:04:25,462 --> 01:04:26,594
This is their place
as much as ours.

1202
01:04:26,596 --> 01:04:28,562
- Yeah, exactly.
- Learned that from you.

1203
01:04:28,564 --> 01:04:30,963
I just thought I heard
something.

1204
01:04:30,965 --> 01:04:33,435
Is that a two-winged
flying bird up there?

1205
01:04:33,437 --> 01:04:34,803
- I must mark it down.
- Where?

1206
01:04:34,805 --> 01:04:36,404
- Up there.
- She believes him.

1207
01:04:36,406 --> 01:04:37,938
We'll never
get rid of him now.

1208
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:39,607
I don't think so.

1209
01:04:39,609 --> 01:04:42,680
Up there. Just in
that... In the faraway tree.

1210
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:49,452
You are using explosives.

1211
01:04:50,119 --> 01:04:51,585
You lied to me.

1212
01:04:51,587 --> 01:04:52,890
Well, yes, but...

1213
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:24,454
My house.

1214
01:05:24,987 --> 01:05:26,322
My paintings.

1215
01:05:28,791 --> 01:05:29,793
Their burrow.

1216
01:05:32,427 --> 01:05:34,430
This is going to be difficult
for you to hear,

1217
01:05:35,731 --> 01:05:36,733
but he did it.

1218
01:05:37,066 --> 01:05:38,468
He detonated it.

1219
01:05:39,968 --> 01:05:41,338
He's a rabbit.

1220
01:05:41,737 --> 01:05:42,738
I know.

1221
01:05:43,139 --> 01:05:44,604
But somehow,

1222
01:05:44,606 --> 01:05:47,376
he found the detonator,
and he took his paw...

1223
01:05:48,176 --> 01:05:50,477
And he did all that
to come between us.

1224
01:05:50,479 --> 01:05:52,043
He's a rabbit!

1225
01:05:52,045 --> 01:05:53,747
All right. Okay.
Let's be reasonable.

1226
01:05:53,749 --> 01:05:55,715
For a start, you know
they rob from the garden.

1227
01:05:55,717 --> 01:05:58,785
Did you know
they set traps in my bed?

1228
01:05:58,787 --> 01:06:01,154
So when I woke up,
I hurt my little fingers!

1229
01:06:01,156 --> 01:06:03,121
And then they used
electricity against me,

1230
01:06:03,123 --> 01:06:04,257
which we invented,

1231
01:06:04,259 --> 01:06:07,192
but they modified for
their own nefarious purposes!

1232
01:06:07,194 --> 01:06:08,829
And they saw the Bananagrams,

1233
01:06:08,831 --> 01:06:11,564
they saw the bicycle ride,
they saw the walk in the park.

1234
01:06:11,566 --> 01:06:13,733
And where did they get
the jackets? We don't know!

1235
01:06:13,735 --> 01:06:15,500
But they've
been there all along.

1236
01:06:15,502 --> 01:06:17,637
You're a crazy person.

1237
01:06:17,639 --> 01:06:19,808
I can't believe
I thought I liked you.

1238
01:06:20,775 --> 01:06:21,777
You do like me.

1239
01:06:24,178 --> 01:06:25,748
And I like you. That's...

1240
01:06:26,948 --> 01:06:28,916
Are you okay, sweeties?

1241
01:06:28,918 --> 01:06:29,919
I'm sorry.

1242
01:06:32,754 --> 01:06:33,752
Come on.

1243
01:06:33,754 --> 01:06:36,424
Let's get away
from this evil man.

1244
01:06:43,931 --> 01:06:44,964
I'm sorry.

1245
01:06:44,966 --> 01:06:47,402
Yes, so am I.

1246
01:07:02,750 --> 01:07:05,115
Another day?
I can't believe it!

1247
01:07:05,117 --> 01:07:06,685
This is so exciting!

1248
01:07:06,687 --> 01:07:07,853
I know, right?

1249
01:07:07,855 --> 01:07:09,554
Can you believe it?

1250
01:07:09,556 --> 01:07:12,525
Although, things aren't going
so great now,

1251
01:07:12,527 --> 01:07:14,830
so maybe last night
should've been it!

1252

01:07:44,893 --> 01:07:45,894
Come in.

1259
01:07:47,528 --> 01:07:49,294
I'm so sorry about your home.

1260
01:07:49,296 --> 01:07:52,763
It's all my fault. I should never
have invited him into our lives.

1261
01:07:52,765 --> 01:07:55,533
He's such an idiot,
and going after you like that

1262
01:07:55,535 --> 01:07:57,801
when you've done absolutely
nothing to goad him.

1263
01:07:57,803 --> 01:07:59,740
You're just going
about your business,

1264
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:01,609
a complete innocent.

1265
01:08:05,778 --> 01:08:09,082
Sad truth is, though, I
actually kind of fell for him.

1266
01:08:10,550 --> 01:08:12,486
I could have loved him, even.

1267
01:08:14,186 --> 01:08:15,922

Really bad.

1275
01:08:45,919 --> 01:08:48,619
You haven't really been

1276
01:08:48,621 --> 01:08:50,788
You're just scared
of losing her.

1277
01:08:50,790 --> 01:08:53,824
But sharing love
is not losing love.

1278
01:08:53,826 --> 01:08:55,059
Love is infinite.

1279
01:08:55,061 --> 01:08:58,127
You think we loved you any
less after we had the girls?

1280
01:08:58,129 --> 01:09:00,933
Be honest with yourself,
Peter, and go with your heart.

1281
01:09:01,633 --> 01:09:03,000
You've got a good one.

1282
01:09:03,002 --> 01:09:05,803

Thomas!

1289
01:09:36,636 --> 01:09:38,268
I thought it was you.

1290
01:09:38,270 --> 01:09:39,935
I've been trying to call you.

1291
01:09:39,937 --> 01:09:42,138
I'm sorry, there's
no reception in Windermere.

1292
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:43,340
How barbaric.

1293
01:09:43,342 --> 01:09:46,242
On the contrary,
it's one of its many beauties.

1294
01:09:46,244 --> 01:09:47,644
I have some good news.

1295
01:09:47,646 --> 01:09:49,380
Bannerman's no longer with us.

1296
01:09:49,382 --> 01:09:53,384
- He died.
- Earring infection in both ears.

1297
01:09:53,386 --> 01:09:56,720
Said it was the stress
of working here for one day.

1298
01:09:56,722 --> 01:09:59,689
Quit, moved to France,
of course.

1299
01:09:59,691 --> 01:10:01,792
- I'm sorry, is he dead?
- No.

1300
01:10:01,794 --> 01:10:04,326
I thought maybe "moving
to France" was a euphemism.

1301
01:10:04,328 --> 01:10:06,328
The job's yours
if you want it,

1302
01:10:06,330 --> 01:10:08,331
pending a psychological
evaluation,

1303
01:10:08,333 --> 01:10:10,332
but you seem much better.

1304
01:10:10,334 --> 01:10:12,300
Interested?

1305
01:10:12,302 --> 01:10:13,703
Where would I find
men's scarves?

1306
01:10:13,705 --> 01:10:14,738
- Lower ground.
- Lower ground.

1307
01:10:14,740 --> 01:10:16,873
Just take the escalator down.
Right, right, left.

1308
01:10:16,875 --> 01:10:19,011
With your hip-to-waist ratio,
I'd suggest a green check.

1309
01:10:19,410 --> 01:10:20,780
You work here?

1310
01:10:21,046 --> 01:10:22,047
Do you?

1311
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:24,414
Do you?

1312
01:10:24,416 --> 01:10:25,550
I'm thinking.

1313
01:10:29,421 --> 01:10:30,790
- Do you?
- I...

1314
01:10:35,793 --> 01:10:37,229
I'm gonna go make this right.

1315
01:10:38,229 --> 01:10:39,761
I've wrecked our home.

1316
01:10:39,763 --> 01:10:41,229
I've wrecked Bea's home.

1317
01:10:41,231 --> 01:10:43,131
I'm a real home-wrecker.

1318
01:10:43,133 --> 01:10:45,734
Think I'm using
that expression properly.

1319
01:10:45,736 --> 01:10:47,303
I got us into this,

1320
01:10:47,305 --> 01:10:49,138
and I let you all down.

1321
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:50,175
I'm really sorry.

1322
01:10:51,041 --> 01:10:53,145
I prepared a speech.

1323
01:10:54,244 --> 01:10:55,777
"I got us into this,

1324
01:10:55,779 --> 01:10:57,179
"and I let you all down.

1325
01:10:57,181 --> 01:10:58,182
"I'm really sorry."

1326
01:10:59,350 --> 01:11:01,917
I guess that was
the whole thing.

1327
01:11:01,919 --> 01:11:03,752
Kind of crushed it
the first time.

1328
01:11:08,926 --> 01:11:10,792
I should've listened
to you, Benjamin.

1329
01:11:10,794 --> 01:11:13,328
Not just about this,
about everything.

1330
01:11:13,330 --> 01:11:14,929
You're so much wiser than me.

1331
01:11:14,931 --> 01:11:16,734
It wasn't about the garden.

1332
01:11:17,502 --> 01:11:19,200
I don't know where
I'd be without you.

1333
01:11:19,202 --> 01:11:20,672
In a pie, probably.

1334
01:11:21,270 --> 01:11:22,804
Probably.

1335
01:11:22,806 --> 01:11:24,809
And I should've been
a better big brother.

1336
01:11:26,476 --> 01:11:27,942
Truth is,

1337
01:11:27,944 --> 01:11:29,947
I'm a little lost
without Mum and Dad.

1338
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:32,446
I miss them so much.

1339
01:11:32,448 --> 01:11:34,215
- So do we.
- Yeah.

1340
01:11:34,217 --> 01:11:35,219
Me, too.

1341
01:11:46,462 --> 01:11:48,330
So, are we good?

1342
01:11:48,332 --> 01:11:49,835
This was pretty bad,

1343
01:11:50,266 --> 01:11:51,702
even for you.

1344
01:11:58,108 --> 01:11:59,310
I'm scared, Peter.

1345
01:12:00,344 --> 01:12:02,510
Don't be. I'm gonna fix this.

1346
01:12:02,512 --> 01:12:03,944
- What should we do?
- Just make sure

1347
01:12:03,946 --> 01:12:05,781
she doesn't leave
until I get back.

1348
01:12:05,783 --> 01:12:08,052
Should we break
both ankles or just one?

1349
01:12:09,951 --> 01:12:11,822
I'm sorry, that was weird.

1350
01:12:12,256 --> 01:12:13,388
- Both.
- What?

1351
01:12:13,390 --> 01:12:15,824
Just stall her.
I won't let you down.

1352
01:12:15,826 --> 01:12:17,895
- I promise.
- You can count on us.

1353
01:12:19,496 --> 01:12:21,428
Also, I didn't kill
old McGregor.

1354
01:12:21,430 --> 01:12:23,264
He died of a heart attack.

1355
01:12:23,266 --> 01:12:24,931
- We know.
- The whole time.

1356
01:12:24,933 --> 01:12:27,267
- We thought you needed a victory.
- Okay, then.

know how to get to Harrods?

1390
01:13:55,625 --> 01:13:57,356
Absolutely.

1391
01:13:57,358 --> 01:13:58,925
Are you boys from the country?

1392
01:13:58,927 --> 01:13:59,826
How can you tell?

1393
01:13:59,828 --> 01:14:02,261

It's a bit matchy-matchy.

1395

We're kind of in a hurry.

01:14:16,177 --> 01:14:17,510
View of the skyline.

1403
01:14:17,512 --> 01:14:19,679
It's just stunning,
but, Johnny,

1404
01:14:19,681 --> 01:14:21,948
we're on a time-sensitive
mission,

1405
01:14:21,950 --> 01:14:23,983
and it seems like
you're drawing it out a bit

1406
01:14:23,985 --> 01:14:25,652
because of pride
for your hometown.

1407
01:14:25,654 --> 01:14:29,322
London's one of the most culturally
significant cities in the world.

1408
01:14:29,324 --> 01:14:31,658
What kind of host would I be
if I didn't share it with you?

1409
01:14:31,660 --> 01:14:35,297
You're right, if we're actually
here, we should see everything.

1410
01:14:38,133 --> 01:14:39,298
Thanks, Johnny,
we owe you one.

1411
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:43,136
My pleasure. Always happy
to help out a fellow rodent.

1412
01:14:44,571 --> 01:14:45,939
Rodent?

1413
01:14:49,643 --> 01:14:52,044
It's a shame.

1414
01:14:52,046 --> 01:14:54,884
But don't worry, I'll get you
to the train on time.

1415
01:15:09,296 --> 01:15:10,298
Yes!

1416
01:15:13,967 --> 01:15:15,534
Who would
do such a thing?

1417
01:15:15,536 --> 01:15:17,004
I have many enemies.

1418
01:15:18,137 --> 01:15:20,274
Okay, he's got to be here.

1419
01:15:23,977 --> 01:15:26,413
Where is he? Where is he?
Where is he?

1420
01:15:27,181 --> 01:15:30,047
A talking bunny doll?

1421
01:15:30,049 --> 01:15:32,584
I am a rabbit.

1422
01:15:32,586 --> 01:15:34,289
I like carrots.

1423
01:15:35,021 --> 01:15:36,457
Beep-boop, beep...

1424
01:15:44,530 --> 01:15:46,665
This isn't happening.
He's just an illusion.

1425
01:15:46,667 --> 01:15:49,568
Deep breaths. Deep breaths.

1426
01:15:49,570 --> 01:15:51,569
Mr. McGregor. Psst.

1427
01:15:51,571 --> 01:15:53,274
Remember me from before?

1428
01:15:54,574 --> 01:15:56,541
No, no, no, no!
I just want to talk.

1429
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:58,076
I just want to talk.

1430
01:15:58,078 --> 01:16:01,712
Rabbits don't talk!
I knew you could talk!

1431
01:16:01,714 --> 01:16:04,519
Wait, are you talking
or am I just hallucinating?

1432
01:16:06,352 --> 01:16:08,687
Call Security. He's gone
crackers again.

1433
01:16:08,689 --> 01:16:10,958
You ruined my life!

1434
01:16:14,060 --> 01:16:15,092
McGregor!

1435
01:16:15,094 --> 01:16:16,564
You got to come back with us.

1436
01:16:17,798 --> 01:16:20,097
Back to Bea.
She's about to leave.

1437
01:16:20,099 --> 01:16:22,133
She's gonna give up painting
and go home.

1438
01:16:22,135 --> 01:16:23,501
She wants nothing
to do with me.

1439
01:16:23,503 --> 01:16:25,636
That's because she thinks
this is all your fault.

1440
01:16:25,638 --> 01:16:29,507
But we both know that I had a little
tiny something to do with it.

1441
01:16:29,509 --> 01:16:30,776
"Little"?

1442
01:16:30,778 --> 01:16:32,477
- "Tiny"?
- Okay, a lot.

1443
01:16:32,479 --> 01:16:34,513
I'm not good at owning up
to my mistakes.

1444
01:16:34,515 --> 01:16:36,246
I'm working on it.

1445
01:16:36,248 --> 01:16:38,985
- McGregor!
- I just hope it's not too late.

1446
01:16:39,653 --> 01:16:40,818
I let her down.

1447
01:16:40,820 --> 01:16:42,385
It's over.

1448
01:16:42,387 --> 01:16:43,521
It's not.

1449
01:16:43,523 --> 01:16:44,790
I just wanted you gone.

1450
01:16:44,792 --> 01:16:46,625
I didn't think of
anyone but myself.

1451
01:16:46,627 --> 01:16:48,259
I'm sorry I electrocuted you.

1452
01:16:48,261 --> 01:16:49,795
I'm sorry I put
traps on your head.

1453
01:16:49,797 --> 01:16:51,763
I'm sorry I rubbed my butt
on your hairbrush.

1454
01:16:51,765 --> 01:16:53,563
Wait. Wait. What?

1455
01:16:53,565 --> 01:16:55,301
Nothing. Stay focused.

1456
01:16:56,536 --> 01:16:58,469
Please come back. Not for me.

1457
01:16:58,471 --> 01:17:01,141
- For Bea.
- How do I know this isn't a trick?

1458
01:17:02,675 --> 01:17:03,706
You don't.

1459
01:17:03,708 --> 01:17:05,345
You just have to trust me.

1460
01:17:06,244 --> 01:17:07,447
Trust us.

1461
01:17:08,547 --> 01:17:10,282
So you really are
talking?

1462
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:13,116
No. Like you said,

1463
01:17:13,118 --> 01:17:15,820
you chilled out, man.
You're cool now.

1464
01:17:15,822 --> 01:17:17,420
And you're listening
to your heart.

1465
01:17:17,422 --> 01:17:18,688
That's what you're hearing.

1466
01:17:18,690 --> 01:17:20,657
McGregor!
Unlock this door!

1467
01:17:20,659 --> 01:17:21,692
Now listen to your heart.

1468
01:17:21,694 --> 01:17:22,692
It's telling you to turn left,

1469
01:17:22,694 --> 01:17:24,461
run six paces to that window,
break it open,

1470
01:17:24,463 --> 01:17:26,466
and let's get the
heck out of here!

1471
01:17:28,167 --> 01:17:30,237
McGregor! Open up!

1472
01:17:35,675 --> 01:17:37,042
McGregor!

1473
01:17:45,818 --> 01:17:48,317
<i>And so the two
former enemies</i>

1474
01:17:48,319 --> 01:17:51,320
<i>and one of their cousins
set out across the country,</i>

1475
01:17:51,322 --> 01:17:53,557
<i>a ticking clock
their common adversary.</i>

1476
01:17:53,559 --> 01:17:56,325
<i>It was dangerous, gutsy,
convoluted,</i>

1477
01:17:56,327 --> 01:17:58,160
<i>and, in a story like this,</i>

1478
01:17:58,162 --> 01:18:00,865
<i>pretty much a journey
guaranteed to succeed.</i>

1479
01:18:00,867 --> 01:18:03,069
<i>So let's just
hit the highlights.</i>

1480
01:18:10,207 --> 01:18:11,775
Everybody, hang on!

1481
01:18:21,620 --> 01:18:22,820
Now!

1482
01:18:27,526 --> 01:18:29,491
Headlights.

1483
01:18:29,493 --> 01:18:30,660
What?

1484
01:18:30,662 --> 01:18:31,895
They're not even on.

1485
01:18:31,897 --> 01:18:34,297
Come on! This is ridiculous.

1486
01:18:34,299 --> 01:18:35,365
Shoo.

1487
01:18:35,367 --> 01:18:37,603
Okay. Come on.
Get out of here. Go.

1488
01:18:44,942 --> 01:18:46,645
I'm fine! I'm fine!

1489
01:18:47,912 --> 01:18:49,512
Thomas?

1490
01:18:49,514 --> 01:18:51,250
What are you doing?

1491
01:18:51,815 --> 01:18:53,249
You once said

1492
01:18:53,251 --> 01:18:55,184
that everyone has
a place in this world.

1493
01:18:55,186 --> 01:18:56,753
Well, this is your place,

1494
01:18:56,755 --> 01:18:59,722
and you shouldn't have to leave
because of something I did.

1495
01:18:59,724 --> 01:19:01,723
Were they with you?

1496
01:19:01,725 --> 01:19:03,225
Yes. They came to London.

1497
01:19:03,227 --> 01:19:04,893
- "They came to London"?
- Yes.

1498
01:19:04,895 --> 01:19:06,194
Yes. To talk me
into coming back.

1499
01:19:06,196 --> 01:19:08,830
Well, they probably didn't talk.
It was probably all in my head.

1500
01:19:08,832 --> 01:19:10,767
Well... No.
But that's not the point.

1501
01:19:10,769 --> 01:19:12,802
You shouldn't have to leave.

1502
01:19:12,804 --> 01:19:15,504
I'm sorry for
everything that I did.

1503
01:19:15,506 --> 01:19:18,273
And I love you, Bea.

1504
01:19:18,275 --> 01:19:19,909
Aw.

1505
01:19:19,911 --> 01:19:21,910
You tried to kill them.

1506
01:19:21,912 --> 01:19:23,745
You blew up their home.

1507
01:19:23,747 --> 01:19:24,980
You blew up my home.

1508
01:19:24,982 --> 01:19:26,682
'Cause I got caught up
in everything, you know?

1509
01:19:26,684 --> 01:19:27,949
I got caught up in our fight.

1510
01:19:27,951 --> 01:19:29,418
"Our" fight?

1511
01:19:29,420 --> 01:19:31,721
You're still going on
about this. Pathetic.

1512
01:19:31,723 --> 01:19:32,988
Come on, Betty, let's go.

1513
01:19:32,990 --> 01:19:34,459
It was my fault.

1514
01:19:35,593 --> 01:19:37,626
I take full responsibility.

1515
01:19:37,628 --> 01:19:38,660
My hero.

1516
01:19:38,662 --> 01:19:41,462
Finally admitting
that he blew up the burrow.

1517
01:19:41,464 --> 01:19:43,431
Not, as you
previously claimed,

1518
01:19:43,433 --> 01:19:47,371
the button on the detonator
being pushed by a rabbit!

1519
01:20:01,950 --> 01:20:03,718
Hello, sweetie.

1520
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:04,722
Are you okay?

1521
01:20:16,767 --> 01:20:18,499
You were a part of this?

1522
01:20:18,501 --> 01:20:19,670
I told you!

1523
01:20:20,504 --> 01:20:21,506
I did tell you.

1524
01:20:47,362 --> 01:20:48,461
I can't believe this.

1525
01:20:48,463 --> 01:20:49,864
It's a lot to process.

1526
01:20:49,866 --> 01:20:51,601
- It really is.
- Yes.

1527
01:20:56,071 --> 01:20:57,440
Please forgive us.

1528
01:21:11,587 --> 01:21:13,952
You mind moving
all this out the way?

1529
01:21:13,954 --> 01:21:15,689
I mean, this is
our house and all.

1530
01:21:15,691 --> 01:21:16,658
Perfect country gem.

1531
01:21:16,660 --> 01:21:19,059
My stupid sister's
going to be so jealous.

1532
01:21:19,061 --> 01:21:20,860
I'm sorry. The manor's
no longer for sale.

1533
01:21:20,862 --> 01:21:23,363
Yeah, 'cause it's already
been sold. We bought it.

1534
01:21:23,365 --> 01:21:25,399
- Sorry, who are you?
- I'm the man who sold it.

1535
01:21:25,401 --> 01:21:28,033
And also the man
who is canceling the sale.

1536
01:21:28,035 --> 01:21:29,804
No. Sale's final.

1537
01:21:29,806 --> 01:21:31,103
You sold it already?

1538
01:21:31,105 --> 01:21:32,506
- Yes, but I...
- You and your husband

1539
01:21:32,508 --> 01:21:34,475
- need to move off now.
- I'm not her husband.

1540
01:21:34,477 --> 01:21:35,879
I just... We're...
Although...

1541
01:21:38,079 --> 01:21:40,413
- Get up.
- Bea...

1542
01:21:40,415 --> 01:21:42,449
Come on. There's only one way
out of this.

1543
01:21:42,451 --> 01:21:43,550
- You with me?
- Yep.

1544
01:21:43,552 --> 01:21:44,617
- Absolutely.
- Always.

1545
01:21:44,619 --> 01:21:46,487
- Of course.
- Love you guys.

1546
01:21:46,489 --> 01:21:48,756
Shall we? It's so cute.

1547
01:21:48,758 --> 01:21:51,427
It's like a 3D version of a
storybook, really.

1548
01:21:55,897 --> 01:21:57,633
- Allow me.
- Thank you.

1549
01:22:01,069 --> 01:22:02,102
What is that?

1550
01:22:02,104 --> 01:22:03,839
A gross little goblin or
something.

1551
01:22:04,874 --> 01:22:06,406
Clear off!

1552
01:22:06,408 --> 01:22:07,642
We'll get pest control.

1553
01:22:14,916 --> 01:22:16,519
- Darling.
- Darling.

Absolutely not.

you could do that.
