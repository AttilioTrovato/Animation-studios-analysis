1
00:01:55,313 --> 00:01:57,081
Welcome! Welcome!

2
00:01:57,148 --> 00:01:58,416
Congrats, Drac.

3
00:01:58,483 --> 00:02:01,719
Holy smokes,
everybody's here.

4
00:02:01,786 --> 00:02:04,222
Mr. and Mrs. Loughran,
the parents of the groom, and family.

5
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:11,029
Mom and Dad!
Johnny!

6
00:02:11,094 --> 00:02:12,830
I can't believe
you're all here.

7
00:02:35,119 --> 00:02:36,654
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah!

8
00:02:37,855 --> 00:02:39,891
Yo, how hot is my date?

9
00:02:39,957 --> 00:02:41,726
So hot. Wow.

10
00:02:41,793 --> 00:02:43,161
How 'bout how hot mine is?

11
00:02:43,227 --> 00:02:45,129
You got a date?

12
00:02:45,196 --> 00:02:48,299
Yeah. She's invisible.
That's why you can't see her.

13
00:02:48,366 --> 00:02:49,966
Oh, right. This is
the one from "Canada"?

14
00:02:51,102 --> 00:02:52,136
Wedding's starting.

15
00:03:01,179 --> 00:03:02,180
Ah!

16
00:03:06,117 --> 00:03:07,151
Oh!

17
00:03:10,855 --> 00:03:11,855
Aw!

18
00:03:49,093 --> 00:03:50,528
Whoo-hoo!

19
00:03:51,529 --> 00:03:52,529
Great.

20
00:04:00,304 --> 00:04:02,607
True. So true, Marty.

21
00:04:02,673 --> 00:04:03,841
Aw!

22
00:04:17,855 --> 00:04:19,290
Aw. How sweet.

23
00:04:22,293 --> 00:04:23,895
Oh, my. Look at you.

24
00:04:25,496 --> 00:04:26,576
Oh, my gosh.

25
00:04:27,798 --> 00:04:28,798
Oh.

26
00:04:41,145 --> 00:04:44,181
Is it everything you wanted,
my little poisonberry?

27
00:04:44,248 --> 00:04:45,716
Oh, it is, Daddy.

28
00:04:46,551 --> 00:04:48,753
Except where's Grandpa Vlad?

29
00:04:48,819 --> 00:04:51,289
Honey, your gramps
would not have been cool with this.

30
00:04:51,355 --> 00:04:53,090
He's old school.

31
00:04:53,157 --> 00:04:55,493
How do we know?
If he could just meet Johnny

32
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,261
He would have eaten him.

33
00:04:57,328 --> 00:05:00,197
He's not as
enlightened as your hip Daddy.

34
00:05:00,264 --> 00:05:03,668
So, you're really okay
with him not being a monster?

35
00:05:03,734 --> 00:05:07,705
Human, monster, unicorn,
as long as you're happy.

36
00:05:08,873 --> 00:05:09,941
Thanks, Dad.

37
00:05:12,677 --> 00:05:16,414
And you'll always
be my moonlight

38
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,951
But now on
wings of love you soar

39
00:05:20,017 --> 00:05:22,453
Now that
you're Johnny's girl

40
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,255
Johnny's girl

41
00:05:24,322 --> 00:05:26,724
And kind of Daddy's, too

42
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:28,626
Your mom would be so happy

43
00:05:28,693 --> 00:05:31,028
'Cause she always knew

44
00:05:31,095 --> 00:05:36,200
Love is making room
for all the best in you

45
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:56,687
Hey, Dad.

46
00:05:56,754 --> 00:05:57,855
Oh, hey, guys!

47
00:05:57,922 --> 00:05:59,390
Todd, take a break.

48
00:06:03,261 --> 00:06:04,762
So, what's up?

49
00:06:04,829 --> 00:06:08,232
Mavis was wondering if maybe you
wanted to go for a fly.

50
00:06:08,299 --> 00:06:12,470
Oh. We haven't done that in forever.
Any special reason?

51
00:06:12,536 --> 00:06:14,038
No special reason at all.

52
00:06:15,172 --> 00:06:16,340
Right, Mavey?

53
00:06:17,141 --> 00:06:18,242
What's his deal?

54
00:06:18,309 --> 00:06:19,610
He's silly.

55
00:06:19,677 --> 00:06:21,646
It's just a beautiful night, and

56
00:06:21,712 --> 00:06:23,381
Well, if you don't want to

57
00:06:23,447 --> 00:06:24,915
No, no! Are you kidding?

58
00:06:24,982 --> 00:06:27,485
I would eat a bucket of
garlic to fly with you.

59
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,423
Oh, honey,
look at those fluffy clouds.

60
00:07:06,991 --> 00:07:09,560
Remember what we played
when you were little?

61
00:07:09,627 --> 00:07:12,430
Hide and Go
Seek Sharp Objects?

62
00:07:12,496 --> 00:07:16,100
Okay.
Regular Hide and Go Seek.

63
00:07:18,602 --> 00:07:20,104
Where are you?

64
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,442
Honeybat!

65
00:07:26,477 --> 00:07:27,645
Mavey!

66
00:07:29,447 --> 00:07:30,848
Honeybat!

67
00:07:32,216 --> 00:07:34,585
I'm gonna get you.

68
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:42,660
Honey? Are you okay?

69
00:07:42,727 --> 00:07:44,628
Yes.
It's just a little harder

70
00:07:44,695 --> 00:07:46,864
to catch my breath
since I'm pregnant.

71
00:07:46,931 --> 00:07:49,266
Yes, well, I guess
that would make it more

72
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:50,401
What?

73
00:07:57,675 --> 00:07:59,977
I'm gonna be a grandpa!

74
00:08:01,946 --> 00:08:04,749
And I'm gonna be a dad!

75
00:08:06,517 --> 00:08:09,320
'Cause you're
Daddy's girl, or boy

76
00:08:09,386 --> 00:08:12,256
Daddy's girl, or boy

77
00:08:12,323 --> 00:08:14,058
I'm hungry again, honey.

78
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,885
Can you get me
some ice cream with anchovies?

79
00:08:18,095 --> 00:08:20,464
No, no, no. You mustn't give
in to your cravings.

80
00:08:20,531 --> 00:08:22,700
It's not good for the baby.

81
00:08:22,767 --> 00:08:24,802
You need to increase
your spider intake,

82
00:08:24,869 --> 00:08:26,303
so he'll be able to
climb ceilings properly.

83
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,038
And eat lots of sheep bile.

84
00:08:30,074 --> 00:08:31,909
I love you,
Dad, but we don't even know

85
00:08:31,976 --> 00:08:34,011
if the kid's
gonna be a vampire.

86
00:08:34,078 --> 00:08:37,014
I'd be thrilled if the baby's humany,
just like Johnny.

87
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,217
"Humany." With thousands
of years of Dracula genes.

88
00:08:40,284 --> 00:08:41,551
Not gonna happen.

89
00:08:41,618 --> 00:08:43,554
As long as the baby's healthy.

90
00:08:43,621 --> 00:08:45,990
Of course.
A healthy little vampire.

91
00:08:46,056 --> 00:08:47,124
Or human.

92
00:08:47,191 --> 00:08:50,194
Yes, a human who can
fly as a bat.

93
00:08:50,261 --> 00:08:52,863
Here. Just have
some monster ball soup.

94
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,799
It's your mommy's recipe.

95
00:08:57,701 --> 00:08:58,701
Aw!

96
00:08:59,303 --> 00:09:01,438
Thank you, Dad.

97
00:09:01,505 --> 00:09:04,642
Just like you made it when I was a kid.
My favorite.

98
00:09:16,487 --> 00:09:17,488
Sorry.

99
00:09:32,603 --> 00:09:35,473
Sir, only the father is allowed
in the delivery room.

100
00:09:35,539 --> 00:09:37,808
Really? I mean, okay.

101
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,977
He's the family, I guess.

102
00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:48,919
Oh, look!
It's a boy! It's a boy!

103
00:09:48,986 --> 00:09:52,790
The Dracula
bloodline carries on!

104
00:09:52,857 --> 00:09:56,193
No one will ever harm you
as long as I'm here,

105
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,429
my little devil dog.

106
00:09:58,496 --> 00:10:00,030
Dad, can I hold my baby?

107
00:10:00,097 --> 00:10:02,366
If I were Dad, I'd say yes.

108
00:10:02,433 --> 00:10:04,802
But I'm the nurse, Francine.

109
00:10:04,869 --> 00:10:06,904
Here you go anyway.

110
00:10:12,376 --> 00:10:15,246
My bad.

111
00:10:19,817 --> 00:10:21,986
Little Dennis is
a year old now. Wow!

112
00:10:25,823 --> 00:10:28,025
Nice. Yeah. Cute kid.

113
00:10:30,928 --> 00:10:34,565
Okay, time for presents, guys.

114
00:10:34,632 --> 00:10:38,235
All right!
Let's do this boy up!

115
00:10:38,302 --> 00:10:40,371
Check out what I got him.
Bling!

116
00:10:40,437 --> 00:10:42,339
Wow. Is it cursed?

117
00:10:42,406 --> 00:10:44,375
Super cursed.
Only the best.

118
00:10:44,441 --> 00:10:46,644
Straight from the crypt.

119
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:50,314
He's just starting to walk,
so maybe it's heavier than

120
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:55,052
Oh. You're okay, Denisovich.

121
00:10:55,119 --> 00:10:57,688
His name is Dennis.
Named after my father.

122
00:10:57,755 --> 00:10:59,890
It's not his vampire name.

123
00:10:59,957 --> 00:11:02,359
My little
Denisovichy Weesovichy.

124
00:11:02,426 --> 00:11:05,129
Huh!
Are we sure he's a vampire?

125
00:11:05,195 --> 00:11:07,131
I mean,
not that it's a bad thing,

126
00:11:07,197 --> 00:11:11,435
but shouldn't he have fangs
and that pasty skin you guys have?

127
00:11:11,502 --> 00:11:14,939
Technically, you have until you're five
to get your vampire fangs.

128
00:11:15,005 --> 00:11:16,874
Oh, he'll get his fangs.
He's a Dracula.

129
00:11:16,941 --> 00:11:19,209
He's also half Loughran.

130
00:11:19,276 --> 00:11:22,279
Maybe he'd be better off where we live.
There's more humans there.

131
00:11:22,346 --> 00:11:25,716
What? Look how well he's playing
with the wolf pups.

132
00:11:29,186 --> 00:11:32,656
We have a present.
I hope it's acceptable.

133
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,459
"My First Guillotine."

134
00:11:35,526 --> 00:11:38,629
Very educational.
Well played, Frank.

135
00:11:38,696 --> 00:11:41,966
It's great. Thank you.
We just have to baby proof that.

136
00:11:44,301 --> 00:11:46,370
Johnny, do you know
where you put the rubber guards?

137
00:11:47,571 --> 00:11:49,406
Baby proofing a guillotine?

138
00:11:49,473 --> 00:11:53,010
So you cut your finger off.
It's part of the fun.

139
00:11:53,077 --> 00:11:55,412
She made me
baby proof the whole hotel.

140
00:11:55,479 --> 00:11:57,881
Someone's overprotective.

141
00:12:10,227 --> 00:12:11,227
Aah!

142
00:12:11,428 --> 00:12:12,428
Hmm?

143
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,875
Johnny! Come quick!

144
00:12:27,611 --> 00:12:29,446
What's up? He's okay?

145
00:12:29,513 --> 00:12:31,033
Dennis said his first word!

146
00:12:31,348 --> 00:12:32,750
He did?

147
00:12:32,816 --> 00:12:34,785
Come on, honey.
Say it again.

148
00:12:34,852 --> 00:12:35,853
Bleh, bleh-bleh.

149
00:12:37,254 --> 00:12:39,757
I don't say,
"Bleh, bleh-bleh."

150
00:12:40,691 --> 00:12:42,526
We didn't say you did.

151
00:12:42,593 --> 00:12:43,633
Then where did
he get that?

152
00:12:43,661 --> 00:12:44,962
Bleh, bleh-bleh.

153
00:12:45,029 --> 00:12:47,297
Well, maybe sometimes you say it.

154
00:12:47,364 --> 00:12:49,366
I only say it when I
say I don't say it!

155
00:12:49,867 --> 00:12:51,368
Bleh, bleh-bleh.

156
00:12:51,435 --> 00:12:53,871
Okay, kid.
We get it. You can talk.

157
00:12:55,406 --> 00:12:57,107
Denisovich.

158
00:12:58,409 --> 00:12:59,810
Dad.

159
00:12:59,877 --> 00:13:00,957
Just checking for cavities.

160
00:13:04,415 --> 00:13:07,017
Bleh, bleh-bleh.

161
00:13:07,651 --> 00:13:09,119
It was you!

162
00:13:20,097 --> 00:13:21,265
Oh, my goodness, Leonard.

163
00:13:21,331 --> 00:13:23,200
If you really
looked that hideous,

164
00:13:23,267 --> 00:13:25,035
I don't think I
could hang out with you.

165
00:13:25,102 --> 00:13:26,637
Guys, what's the deal?

166
00:13:26,704 --> 00:13:29,606
Is this a party?
Pick up a phone.

167
00:13:29,673 --> 00:13:34,878
I don't care if Johnny said it's a "cool app."
Johnny's still new here.

168
00:13:34,945 --> 00:13:38,248
Now, Porridge Head, did you call a hearse
for the Gremlinbergs?

169
00:13:38,315 --> 00:13:41,752
No, you're checking
your Facebook page. Again.

170
00:13:41,819 --> 00:13:43,554
Drac, I told the guys social media

171
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,089
is the best way to
promote the hotel.

172
00:13:45,155 --> 00:13:46,356
Right, Clifton?

173
00:13:48,325 --> 00:13:50,527
So, Drac, I wanted
to go through some thoughts I had,

174
00:13:50,594 --> 00:13:53,597
as your new human relations
coordinating co-assistant.

175
00:13:53,664 --> 00:13:54,998
Sure. It's a real job.

176
00:13:55,065 --> 00:13:58,068
Not a cheap excuse to keep Mavis happy,
so you never leave here.

177
00:13:58,135 --> 00:14:00,704
Right. So,
I was thinking,

178
00:14:00,771 --> 00:14:04,741
since we have so many humans now,
maybe update some of the acts?

179
00:14:04,808 --> 00:14:06,210
Like, maybe the magician?

180
00:14:06,276 --> 00:14:08,278
What's wrong with
Harry Three Eye?

181
00:14:08,345 --> 00:14:11,482
Well, he might be
a little old school for the humans.

182
00:14:11,548 --> 00:14:13,550
Tell me,
sir, what was your card?

183
00:14:13,617 --> 00:14:15,085
The three of spades?

184
00:14:17,054 --> 00:14:19,256
Is this your card, my friend?

185
00:14:20,023 --> 00:14:21,191
Whoa!

186
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,962
No, Harry's great.

187
00:14:25,028 --> 00:14:27,164
Can't blame Harry
for the crowd not being hip.

188
00:14:27,231 --> 00:14:29,333
Okay, what about Wayne?

189
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:31,001
Wayne? Are you nuts?
He's my boy.

190
00:14:31,068 --> 00:14:32,970
Then maybe something
other than tennis?

191
00:14:33,036 --> 00:14:35,172
Okay, so, what you wanna do

192
00:14:35,239 --> 00:14:38,709
is lift the racket right on impact, so
you get that nice top spin.

193
00:14:38,776 --> 00:14:40,244
Try and hit one.

194
00:14:49,086 --> 00:14:52,022
What is that? What's the noise? It's on me!

195
00:14:52,089 --> 00:14:53,991
It's just the cell phone I got you.

196
00:14:54,057 --> 00:14:57,060
Clifton's sending you a text
so you can practice how to write back.

197
00:14:57,127 --> 00:14:58,295
Oh!

198
00:14:59,763 --> 00:15:01,031
Eh

199
00:15:01,098 --> 00:15:02,299
What the
It's not doing it.

200
00:15:02,366 --> 00:15:03,400
I got it.

201
00:15:08,906 --> 00:15:10,007
Now you can text Clifton.

202
00:15:11,008 --> 00:15:12,309
All right, fine.

203
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:15,078
How do you do this?

204
00:15:15,145 --> 00:15:16,265
Maybe it's your fingernails.

205
00:15:16,313 --> 00:15:18,715
It's easy.
Look. I'll text Mavis.

206
00:15:18,782 --> 00:15:21,652
Psyched for date night.

207
00:15:21,718 --> 00:15:23,987
See? And now look, she texted right back.

208
00:15:24,054 --> 00:15:26,190
"Gotta cancel.
Can't leave Dennis."

209
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,125
Okay.

210
00:15:28,192 --> 00:15:32,863
Are we never
allowed to be alone again?

211
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:36,733
I need to feel loved, too.

212
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,536
And send.

213
00:15:39,603 --> 00:15:42,873
Okay. All that taught me
is that you're pathetic.

214
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,175
Yeah, got it.
Maybe you should just get Bluetooth.

215
00:15:45,242 --> 00:15:47,544
Okay.
Blue Tooth, come over here.

216
00:15:50,614 --> 00:15:51,915
So, now what?

217
00:15:56,386 --> 00:15:58,689
Rise and shine, my Denisovich.

218
00:15:58,755 --> 00:16:00,457
Hi, Papa.

219
00:16:00,524 --> 00:16:03,861
Hello, my little devil.
Did you have sweet nightmares?

220
00:16:03,927 --> 00:16:07,731
Uh-huh. I dreamed
that I saw a stegosaurus.

221
00:16:07,798 --> 00:16:09,967
Oh And were you
drinking his blood?

222
00:16:10,601 --> 00:16:11,935
No.

223
00:16:12,002 --> 00:16:13,270
Just throwing it out there.

224
00:16:13,337 --> 00:16:14,805
Hey! You want to
do something cool?

225
00:16:14,871 --> 00:16:17,441
Yeah!

226
00:16:17,507 --> 00:16:22,045
I'm going to teach you
how to turn into a bat. Like me.

227
00:16:22,112 --> 00:16:23,947
See?
Cool.

228
00:16:24,014 --> 00:16:25,649
Yes! Cool, like I said.

229
00:16:26,483 --> 00:16:27,618
Now you try.

230
00:16:28,518 --> 00:16:30,120
I'm a bat.

231
00:16:30,187 --> 00:16:32,055
I'm a bat.
I'm a bat. I'm a bat.

232
00:16:32,122 --> 00:16:33,257
I'm a bat.

233
00:16:34,024 --> 00:16:35,592
I mean, a real bat.

234
00:16:35,659 --> 00:16:37,127
I'm a bat!

235
00:16:39,062 --> 00:16:43,567
Denisovich. Take a breath.
You can really turn into a bat.

236
00:16:43,634 --> 00:16:45,669
Try. Feel the bat.

237
00:16:48,038 --> 00:16:49,539
Not a chicken.

238
00:16:52,009 --> 00:16:54,044
What's that?
The electric boogaloo?

239
00:16:54,111 --> 00:16:56,980
If I show you I can bust a move,
will you try to fly, then?

240
00:16:57,047 --> 00:16:58,047
Uh-huh.

241
00:17:12,927 --> 00:17:14,731
Dad? Why are you guys dancing?

242
00:17:15,898 --> 00:17:18,100
Uh, he was sleep dancing.

243
00:17:18,167 --> 00:17:19,536
Come on, sweetie.
Back to bed.

244
00:17:19,603 --> 00:17:22,539
"Back to bed"?
It's already after 8:00 p.m.

245
00:17:22,606 --> 00:17:24,541
Don't you remember
the new sleep schedule?

246
00:17:24,608 --> 00:17:25,509
He's going to human
classes half the day.

247
00:17:25,575 --> 00:17:27,344
Uh

248
00:17:27,411 --> 00:17:30,414
If he could just sleep till 2:00 A.M. tonight,
it'd be so great for him.

249
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,416
But, honeydeath,
six of Wayne's wolf pups

250
00:17:32,482 --> 00:17:34,418
are having
a birthday party tonight.

251
00:17:34,484 --> 00:17:36,586
You wouldn't want
him to miss that.

252
00:17:36,653 --> 00:17:40,424
Dad, I love the wolf pups,
but they're a little too rough for Dennis.

253
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:42,726
"Too rough"?

254
00:17:42,793 --> 00:17:44,795
Haven't you noticed?
Dennis is different.

255
00:17:44,861 --> 00:17:47,664
What are you saying?
Denisovich shouldn't be around monsters?

256
00:17:47,731 --> 00:17:50,968
I love monsters!
Video! Video! Ha!

257
00:17:51,034 --> 00:17:53,136
Oh, you wanna show Papa Drac
your monster video?

258
00:17:53,203 --> 00:17:54,203
Yeah!

259
00:17:57,074 --> 00:17:59,209
Who's the coolest monster?

260
00:17:59,276 --> 00:18:01,044
Kakie!

261
00:18:01,111 --> 00:18:04,081
Wee! Kakie one happy monster!

262
00:18:04,147 --> 00:18:06,683
Kakie love cake! Yummy!

263
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,086
Tummy get a tummyache.

264
00:18:09,152 --> 00:18:12,522
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
How is that a monster?

265
00:18:12,589 --> 00:18:14,691
Have some cake,
Wuzzlelumplebum.

266
00:18:14,758 --> 00:18:18,662
Remember, kids,
a real monster always shares.

267
00:18:18,729 --> 00:18:23,533
"Shares"? Yes! When I think monsters,
I think "shares."

268
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,104
Now, let me tell you what a real
monster is, Denisovich.

269
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:30,774
Dad, please. He's practically five already.
Don't force it.

270
00:18:34,644 --> 00:18:36,880
Slow down, Wuzzlelumplebum.

271
00:18:42,352 --> 00:18:45,922
Twinkle, twinkle,
little star How I wonder

272
00:18:45,989 --> 00:18:48,458
Mommy,
I'm too old for lullabies.

273
00:18:48,525 --> 00:18:50,694
What?
That's not how that one goes.

274
00:18:50,761 --> 00:18:52,329
This is the way
most people sing it.

275
00:18:52,396 --> 00:18:54,598
"Most people"?
What's wrong with

276
00:18:54,664 --> 00:18:58,101
Suffer, suffer,
scream in pain

277
00:18:58,168 --> 00:19:01,538
Blood is spilling
from your brain

278
00:19:01,605 --> 00:19:04,307
Daddy. Come on. You know
how I sang it to you.

279
00:19:04,374 --> 00:19:07,511
Zombies gnaw you
like a plum

280
00:19:07,577 --> 00:19:10,714
Piercing cries
and you succumb

281
00:19:12,349 --> 00:19:16,253
Suffer, suffer,
scream in pain

282
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:21,358
You will never
breathe again

283
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,828
Still works.

284
00:19:45,081 --> 00:19:46,149
Oh

285
00:19:48,051 --> 00:19:50,153
Happy birthday,
Wally, Wilson,

286
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,155
Whoopi,
Waylon, Weepy and Wanye.

287
00:19:53,857 --> 00:19:56,460
Denisovich! My big boy! You made it!

288
00:19:57,461 --> 00:19:59,696
I thought about
what you said, Dad.

289
00:19:59,763 --> 00:20:01,498
Maybe I was being
a little overprotective.

290
00:20:01,565 --> 00:20:03,467
Thank you, coffin cake.

291
00:20:04,468 --> 00:20:06,103
Dennis! I love you! Zing!

292
00:20:06,169 --> 00:20:07,704
Hi, Winnie.

293
00:20:07,771 --> 00:20:10,907
I just love your yummy strawberry locks!
Zing, zing!

294
00:20:14,077 --> 00:20:17,948
Winnie. Give him his space, hon.
I'm sorry, Mavis.

295
00:20:18,014 --> 00:20:20,684
It's okay, Aunt Wanda.
They're just playing.

296
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:24,454
Holy rabies! Limbo?
I used to love that game!

297
00:20:24,521 --> 00:20:26,356
Get in there, Mavey.

298
00:20:26,423 --> 00:20:28,024
Really? But I'm a parent now.

299
00:20:28,091 --> 00:20:29,459
Show 'em how it's done.

300
00:20:29,526 --> 00:20:30,760
Okay. Okay, okay.

301
00:20:39,769 --> 00:20:41,371
No way! A pinata?

302
00:20:45,242 --> 00:20:46,977
Oh, Mavis, honey.
That's for later.

303
00:20:47,043 --> 00:20:48,945
Whoo!

304
00:20:49,012 --> 00:20:50,652
We don't want
the pups to have too much

305
00:20:51,114 --> 00:20:52,549
Candy!

306
00:20:56,152 --> 00:20:57,152
Sugar.

307
00:21:04,861 --> 00:21:06,897
I'm sorry.
Did I start all that?

308
00:21:06,963 --> 00:21:09,003
Don't worry. There's a reason
they call it a litter.

309
00:21:18,842 --> 00:21:19,842
Whoa!

310
00:21:21,144 --> 00:21:23,113
Dennis! Are you okay?

311
00:21:23,179 --> 00:21:25,081
I got a candy.

312
00:21:25,148 --> 00:21:27,050
Look! Your tooth came out.

313
00:21:27,117 --> 00:21:29,553
Are you kidding me?
He got his tooth knocked out?

314
00:21:29,619 --> 00:21:32,656
Oh, yes, indeed.
Here comes the fang.

315
00:21:32,722 --> 00:21:35,825
Dad. His baby tooth wasn't a fang.
Why would this one be?

316
00:21:35,892 --> 00:21:37,460
He's not a monster.

317
00:21:39,763 --> 00:21:40,763
Ooh!

318
00:21:42,399 --> 00:21:45,435
The sun's gonna come out soon,
and we gotta get to his classes.

319
00:21:45,502 --> 00:21:49,239
What's wrong with the classes we have here?
Like the kids' yoga?

320
00:21:49,306 --> 00:21:53,343
Yoga!

321
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:55,478
This is Denisovich's home.

322
00:21:55,545 --> 00:21:57,080
I don't know, Dad.

323
00:21:57,147 --> 00:21:58,515
What don't you know?

324
00:21:58,582 --> 00:22:02,052
Well, we've been
talking about moving.

325
00:22:02,118 --> 00:22:04,554
Somewhere safer
for Dennis.

326
00:22:04,621 --> 00:22:07,524
Maybe where Johnny
grew up in California.

327
00:22:07,591 --> 00:22:11,461
I'm sorry, but you can't just make
somebody something they're not.

328
00:22:13,597 --> 00:22:15,065
Come on, honey.
We have to go.

329
00:22:15,131 --> 00:22:16,333
Zing, zing?

330
00:22:17,467 --> 00:22:20,270
Mavey, wait.
You can't mean that.

331
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,542
You're in on this?
The leaving?

332
00:22:25,609 --> 00:22:28,445
Uh
It's not definite at all.

333
00:22:28,511 --> 00:22:29,713
It's just something
she's definitely talking about,

334
00:22:29,779 --> 00:22:32,015
but until we do it,
it's not definitized.

335
00:22:35,485 --> 00:22:37,420
Did he just cover
me with birdseed?

336
00:22:38,321 --> 00:22:39,723
Yeah, he covered me.

337
00:22:50,033 --> 00:22:52,769
Dad, it's not a fang.

338
00:22:52,836 --> 00:22:55,972
Dad, I don't know
if it's the right place for Dennis.

339
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:57,674
Right, Johnny?

340
00:22:57,741 --> 00:23:00,977
Oh, hey, dudeman.
It's not me. It's Mavey.

341
00:23:01,044 --> 00:23:04,414
Hey, dudeman.
I'm afraid to say anything.

342
00:23:04,481 --> 00:23:06,750
Hey, dudeman. I'm a dudeman!

343
00:23:06,816 --> 00:23:09,286
Uh, Drac? Who you talkin' to?

344
00:23:09,352 --> 00:23:11,521
Do not disturb.
The count's wiggin' out in here.

345
00:23:12,956 --> 00:23:14,824
What are you
wiggin' out about, Drac?

346
00:23:14,891 --> 00:23:18,228
The kids. Mavey Wavey's saying
she wants to leave.

347
00:23:18,295 --> 00:23:20,930
She wants to leave? What about Johnny?
He doesn't wanna go.

348
00:23:20,997 --> 00:23:23,333
He's making the hotel
more humany for Dennis.

349
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,168
You know, seeing
that he isn't a monster.

350
00:23:25,235 --> 00:23:26,603
He is a monster!

351
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:27,737
He's just a late fanger.

352
00:23:27,804 --> 00:23:28,838
Mmm-hmm.

353
00:23:28,905 --> 00:23:30,440
And I could be a hand model.

354
00:23:30,507 --> 00:23:32,742
Shut up!
It's all that humany stuff

355
00:23:32,809 --> 00:23:36,346
that's confusing
poor Denisovich.

356
00:23:36,413 --> 00:23:39,549
So maybe you gotta get the kid
around more monstery things. Ooh!

357
00:23:39,616 --> 00:23:41,751
Oh, I need a cape.

358
00:23:41,818 --> 00:23:44,921
I can't. She's always around,
checking up on me.

359
00:23:44,988 --> 00:23:48,224
Man, if you could
just get some alone time.

360
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:50,660
Wait a minute.
That's what Johnny wants, too.

361
00:23:51,661 --> 00:23:53,830
Alone time with Mavis.

362
00:23:56,599 --> 00:23:57,801
Have they even had a vacation

363
00:23:57,867 --> 00:23:59,369
since before
they were married?

364
00:24:03,373 --> 00:24:06,609
They're going to now. And so are we.
Frank, you're a genius.

365
00:24:18,388 --> 00:24:19,388
Mmm-hmm.

366
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,062
We'll take Denisovich
to all our old haunts.

367
00:24:27,964 --> 00:24:29,364
Each of us will
show him our skills.

368
00:24:31,501 --> 00:24:33,603
Teach him how to be a monster.

369
00:24:36,072 --> 00:24:38,608
And he'll be
fanging it up in no time.

370
00:24:38,675 --> 00:24:40,810
Boy turns five next week.

371
00:24:40,877 --> 00:24:43,413
If he's not a vampire by his birthday,
it ain't happenin'.

372
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,715
Oh, it ain't
ain't happening, baby.

373
00:24:45,782 --> 00:24:48,118
All he needs is
time with his vampa.

374
00:24:48,184 --> 00:24:49,519
"Vampa"?

375
00:24:49,586 --> 00:24:50,920
Vampire grandpa.

376
00:24:50,987 --> 00:24:52,922
Come on, man.
That's obvious.

377
00:24:55,325 --> 00:24:57,527
Johnny. Come outside.

378
00:24:57,594 --> 00:24:59,929
What? Who is it?

379
00:24:59,996 --> 00:25:02,499
It's your father-in-law.
I need to talk to you.

380
00:25:04,167 --> 00:25:05,168
What's up?

381
00:25:05,902 --> 00:25:06,903
Oh.

382
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:09,305
Let me get rid of them. Sorry.

383
00:25:09,372 --> 00:25:12,475
No problemo.
I was kinda diggin' the attention.

384
00:25:14,811 --> 00:25:17,514
Can they stay?
I don't think they're ready to leave yet.

385
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,716
Come on.
Go to your mother.

386
00:25:19,783 --> 00:25:20,984
Look, you want
to stay here, right?

387
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:22,819
Of course.

388
00:25:22,886 --> 00:25:25,555
This is the first place
where I can really be myself.

389
00:25:25,622 --> 00:25:29,058
I haven't felt this alive
since they invented stuffed crust pizza.

390
00:25:29,125 --> 00:25:33,429
Well, then, we've got some work to do.
Okay, so here's the plan.

391
00:25:33,496 --> 00:25:35,765
Maybe it's a good idea
to take her to your hometown.

392
00:25:35,832 --> 00:25:38,067
But remember

393
00:25:38,134 --> 00:25:40,970
So, it's sliced avocado,
rolled oats with apricot,

394
00:25:41,037 --> 00:25:43,339
the Aveeno
moisturizer after every bath.

395
00:25:43,406 --> 00:25:46,709
And then the shea butter
on his tush before his PJs

396
00:25:46,776 --> 00:25:49,479
and then 20 minutes
with the nebulizer

397
00:25:49,546 --> 00:25:52,749
while I read his Learning Factory
Phonics book to him.

398
00:25:52,816 --> 00:25:56,186
It's asking a lot, Dad.
We could just take Dennis with us.

399
00:25:56,252 --> 00:25:59,122
What? Are you kidding me?
And get him off his routine?

400
00:25:59,189 --> 00:26:00,490
No, no, no.

401
00:26:00,557 --> 00:26:02,592
You kids go to California,

402
00:26:02,659 --> 00:26:05,028
and see if it's the right place
to raise Denisovich.

403
00:26:05,094 --> 00:26:06,863
And you remember
how to video chat?

404
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:10,233
Yes, yes. With the phone
and the buttons and the agony.

405
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:14,170
Thanks for being so understanding, Dad.
I know you'll keep him safe.

406
00:26:14,237 --> 00:26:17,774
Of course, Mavey.
Stake my heart and hope to die.

407
00:26:17,841 --> 00:26:19,742
I'm just gonna
miss him so much.

408
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:22,512
I love you, Dennis.

409
00:26:22,579 --> 00:26:24,380
I love you, Mommy.

410
00:26:24,447 --> 00:26:28,017
I'll tell him Mavey Wavey stories
every night before bed.

411
00:26:28,084 --> 00:26:29,953
You're the best.
I love you, Dad.

412
00:26:33,256 --> 00:26:35,859
Gonna miss all you guys.
You're all my family.

413
00:26:36,593 --> 00:26:38,661
Love you, Drac.

414
00:26:38,728 --> 00:26:41,030
Yes. I love you, too.

415
00:26:41,097 --> 00:26:44,801
Now, remember the plan.
Just keep her distracted and happy.

416
00:26:44,868 --> 00:26:47,303
But not too happy, capisce?
Got it.

417
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:49,906
Operation "Just Keep Her
Distracted and Happy,

418
00:26:49,973 --> 00:26:53,276
"But Not Too Happy, Capisce,"
starts now. Cool?

419
00:26:53,343 --> 00:26:54,811
Smiling on the outside.

420
00:26:54,878 --> 00:26:55,979
Will you hug my backpack?

421
00:26:56,045 --> 00:26:57,045
No.

422
00:27:03,586 --> 00:27:05,455
Back to bed.

423
00:27:05,522 --> 00:27:08,658
Ah, yes, we'll get to the bed.
We all love the bed.

424
00:27:08,725 --> 00:27:10,994
But we're just gonna
do one thing first.

425
00:27:14,898 --> 00:27:16,699
Is it shorts
weather where we're going?

426
00:27:16,766 --> 00:27:19,435
Jeez. I hope not.
My body isn't swimsuit ready yet.

427
00:27:19,502 --> 00:27:21,771
Whatever. Where's Griffin?

428
00:27:21,838 --> 00:27:24,107
Hey, can I have a second?
I'm just saying goodbye to Emily.

429
00:27:24,173 --> 00:27:25,808
Oh, brother.

430
00:27:25,875 --> 00:27:28,444
I'm gonna miss you so much.

431
00:27:28,511 --> 00:27:30,280
You know, you have to be strong, honey.

432
00:27:30,346 --> 00:27:31,746
Because what we
have is unbreakable.

433
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:36,853
Babe, don't cry.
Everyone's looking.

434
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,521
Okay, I gotta call him on this.

435
00:27:38,588 --> 00:27:41,558
Just let him play it out,
get it over with.

436
00:27:41,624 --> 00:27:46,095
Okay, you two lovebirds.
Drink your champagne and let's get going.

437
00:27:46,162 --> 00:27:48,364
Oh, yeah.
No, sure. Okay.

438
00:27:48,431 --> 00:27:49,431
Cheers, babe.

439
00:27:51,534 --> 00:27:53,836
Oh. You klutz.

440
00:27:53,903 --> 00:27:55,972
We can't say
nothin' about this?

441
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:57,399
No. We don't have
time for zingers.

442
00:28:05,882 --> 00:28:09,319
How do you click in
the stupid car seat?

443
00:28:09,385 --> 00:28:11,054
You gotta cut
those nails, man.

444
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,822
We just strap our
kids down with duct tape.

445
00:28:17,694 --> 00:28:19,295
What's he doing here?

446
00:28:19,362 --> 00:28:22,165
I told him he could come.
He's never been outside the hotel.

447
00:28:22,231 --> 00:28:24,934
Blobby, there's no room.
Sorry, man.

448
00:28:27,603 --> 00:28:29,305
Yeah, that ain't happenin'.

449
00:28:29,372 --> 00:28:32,008
Fine, put him on the Rascal.
Let's just get going.

450
00:28:37,613 --> 00:28:38,648
Oh.

451
00:28:46,923 --> 00:28:49,325
Where are we going,
Papa Drac?

452
00:28:49,392 --> 00:28:51,794
Oh, Denisovich, we're going
to have an adventure.

453
00:28:51,861 --> 00:28:54,030
A monstery adventure.

454
00:28:54,097 --> 00:28:56,966
Yay! Monsters!
We're gonna eat cake.

455
00:28:57,033 --> 00:28:59,068
What did he say?

456
00:28:59,135 --> 00:29:01,537
No.
No cake on this monster trip.

457
00:29:01,604 --> 00:29:05,141
No cake, cebause Kakie says,
"Too much cake makes tummy ache."

458
00:29:05,475 --> 00:29:06,776
Yay!

459
00:29:06,843 --> 00:29:08,277
"A monster always shares."

460
00:29:09,946 --> 00:29:11,347
Wow!

461
00:29:11,414 --> 00:29:13,750
We may need
more than a week.

462
00:29:13,816 --> 00:29:16,986
Hey, you know who
could fix the kid in a snap? Vlad.

463
00:29:17,053 --> 00:29:20,523
What? We don't need to call Vlad.
We got this.

464
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:25,128
You see, Denisovich,
monsters are nice, just like you.

465
00:29:25,194 --> 00:29:29,399
But when the moon comes out,
the real monster fun begins.

466
00:29:31,234 --> 00:29:32,769
Being scary. Right, guys?

467
00:29:36,706 --> 00:29:38,066
Guys? Guys!
What is wrong with you?

468
00:29:40,009 --> 00:29:42,145
Come on.
Everybody likes that song.

469
00:29:42,211 --> 00:29:45,982
We're not everybody.
We're scary monsters. Remember?

470
00:29:46,049 --> 00:29:47,283
Hey, what are you putting in?

471
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,818
It's an audio book.

472
00:29:48,885 --> 00:29:51,988
Bigfoot's life story.
He reads it himself.

473
00:29:52,055 --> 00:29:53,689
Chapter One.

474
00:30:26,089 --> 00:30:27,156
Wow!

475
00:30:27,223 --> 00:30:29,358
This is gonna be so amazing.

476
00:30:29,425 --> 00:30:32,462
Oh, yeah. You're gonna be so happy,
but not too happy.

477
00:30:32,528 --> 00:30:33,963
Huh?
What?

478
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:36,299
I wanna see everything
you did growing up.

479
00:30:36,365 --> 00:30:38,501
As long as you're distracted, capisce?

480
00:30:40,436 --> 00:30:42,004
We can hit a few spots
on the way to my parents.

481
00:30:42,071 --> 00:30:43,573
Lemme just quickly call home.

482
00:30:43,639 --> 00:30:45,308
Ah! Don't do that.

483
00:30:45,374 --> 00:30:48,177
It's only 1:00 A.M. there.
Dennis isn't even up yet.

484
00:30:48,244 --> 00:30:51,514
Right. I'm just not used to
being away from him.

485
00:30:51,581 --> 00:30:54,016
Everything's gonna be cool.
Your dad was so all over it.

486
00:30:54,083 --> 00:30:56,119
I know. He's the best.

487
00:31:16,806 --> 00:31:18,107
Right turn, here.

488
00:31:19,108 --> 00:31:20,943
Denisovich, rise and shine.

489
00:31:22,578 --> 00:31:25,181
Boys, this bringing
back any memories?

490
00:31:25,248 --> 00:31:28,518
We used to prowl around here
when we were in our 100s.

491
00:31:28,584 --> 00:31:31,888
The Dark Forest of Slobozia.

492
00:31:41,297 --> 00:31:42,932
Nice how they built it up.

493
00:31:42,999 --> 00:31:45,168
Okay, out of the car.

494
00:31:45,234 --> 00:31:47,770
Denisovich,
you're going to see

495
00:31:47,837 --> 00:31:50,339
every monster
do his specialty.

496
00:31:50,406 --> 00:31:54,043
First, Frank's gonna show us
how he scares people.

497
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:56,879
Yay! He's gonna say, "Boo."

498
00:31:56,946 --> 00:31:59,415
Yeah, I don't
think "boos" ever work.

499
00:31:59,482 --> 00:32:02,518
But that's why we're here.
To learn from the master.

500
00:32:03,719 --> 00:32:05,388
Okay, I'll give it a shot.

501
00:32:21,437 --> 00:32:23,606
Yeah, guess it just depends
on work.

502
00:32:25,241 --> 00:32:26,776
Frankenstein!

503
00:32:26,843 --> 00:32:28,911
Hey, how ya doin'?

504
00:32:28,978 --> 00:32:32,081
You're awesome! Can we take a picture?
Is that okay?

505
00:32:32,148 --> 00:32:34,150
Sure, okay. Little
selfie action.

506
00:32:35,418 --> 00:32:36,418
For real?

507
00:32:37,086 --> 00:32:38,621
Awesome! Thank you so much.

508
00:32:38,688 --> 00:32:39,956
Hey, have a great day.

509
00:32:40,623 --> 00:32:42,158
Boo!

510
00:32:42,225 --> 00:32:44,360
Oh. He's adorable.
He's adorable.

511
00:32:44,427 --> 00:32:46,362
Adorable, yes.

512
00:32:46,429 --> 00:32:49,298
Not scary,
but "boo" is a start.

513
00:33:00,209 --> 00:33:02,979
My birthday cake's gonna have
the coolest guy on it.

514
00:33:03,045 --> 00:33:05,381
Let me guess. Kakie.

515
00:33:05,448 --> 00:33:09,252
No. He's so cool.
He climbs walls and wears a cape.

516
00:33:09,318 --> 00:33:12,288
Oh, really. And who
is this very cool guy?

517
00:33:12,355 --> 00:33:14,023
Batman!

518
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:15,825
Batman. Great.

519
00:33:15,892 --> 00:33:19,095
You don't know anyone else
with a cape that's cool?

520
00:33:19,161 --> 00:33:20,263
This is good. Stop here.

521
00:33:26,435 --> 00:33:29,705
Okay, Wayne. It's your turn.
Go kill something.

522
00:33:29,772 --> 00:33:30,906
Denisovich, watch this.

523
00:33:30,973 --> 00:33:32,208
What?

524
00:33:32,275 --> 00:33:33,576
I told you, come on.

525
00:33:33,643 --> 00:33:35,511
If we don't
inspire Denisovich,

526
00:33:35,578 --> 00:33:37,546
how's he going to
find his inner monster?

527
00:33:37,613 --> 00:33:38,948
Who's in a monster?

528
00:33:39,015 --> 00:33:40,516
Nobody, just

529
00:33:40,583 --> 00:33:41,583
Here, have an avocado.

530
00:33:41,617 --> 00:33:42,852
Yay!

531
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:44,920
Your mommy says
it's a good fat.

532
00:33:44,987 --> 00:33:47,056
Whatever
the heaven that means.

533
00:33:47,123 --> 00:33:49,091
Listen, I'm not gonna
set monsters back again

534
00:33:49,158 --> 00:33:51,661
just to make your
grandkid like vampires.

535
00:33:51,727 --> 00:33:53,847
Anyway, there's nothing to kill here.
It's all been

536
00:33:57,199 --> 00:33:58,467
Aw

537
00:33:58,534 --> 00:33:59,702
What a cutie.

538
00:34:00,536 --> 00:34:01,904
But kill him.

539
00:34:01,971 --> 00:34:05,574
Oh, great. You know
I haven't done this in years.

540
00:34:05,641 --> 00:34:08,544
We don't need to kill anymore.
We have Pop Tarts.

541
00:34:08,611 --> 00:34:11,013
Denisovich,
you're going to love this.

542
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,983
Wayne's going to eat that whole deer,
and the next one's yours.

543
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:15,151
Wayne, go.

544
00:34:19,822 --> 00:34:22,124
Oh, man. I'm too old for this.

545
00:34:22,191 --> 00:34:24,493
Okay, how's it go again?

546
00:34:25,861 --> 00:34:27,363
No, no, wait.
That's for the moon.

547
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:29,597
Oh, I growl. Right, here goes.

548
00:34:31,767 --> 00:34:33,068
Growl!

549
00:34:33,135 --> 00:34:34,135
Get it, boy.

550
00:34:39,842 --> 00:34:41,276
Get it, Uncle Wayne.

551
00:34:43,713 --> 00:34:47,615
Some werewolf.
Did you actually say the word "growl?"

552
00:34:47,682 --> 00:34:49,084
You're a werewussy.

553
00:34:49,151 --> 00:34:50,486
I said I was rusty.

554
00:34:52,188 --> 00:34:53,823
Gimme me that Frisbee.

555
00:34:53,889 --> 00:34:55,324
No! It's my Frisbee!
I fetched it!

556
00:34:55,391 --> 00:34:56,992
Give it to me!
Give it back!

557
00:34:57,059 --> 00:34:59,528
Give it over here!
Give me that! Give it back!

558
00:35:05,201 --> 00:35:06,802
He's fine.
He's Blobby.

559
00:35:09,572 --> 00:35:12,475
This place is so
amazing and scenic.

560
00:35:12,541 --> 00:35:13,709
What do you
wanna show me first?

561
00:35:13,776 --> 00:35:15,077
Mmm. I don't know.

562
00:35:15,144 --> 00:35:16,579
It's pretty,
but there's really

563
00:35:16,645 --> 00:35:18,047
nothing to do
once it gets dark.

564
00:35:18,114 --> 00:35:19,515
Wait. What's that place?

565
00:35:24,019 --> 00:35:26,222
So, you're telling
me that I can pick

566
00:35:26,288 --> 00:35:27,968
between all these
different kinds of chips?

567
00:35:28,691 --> 00:35:29,859
Yes.

568
00:35:29,925 --> 00:35:31,694
How do people decide?

569
00:35:32,395 --> 00:35:33,662
Whoa!

570
00:35:33,729 --> 00:35:36,532
Now what's that
beautiful fountain of rubies?

571
00:35:37,733 --> 00:35:39,702
Johnny,
have you tried this Slurpee?

572
00:35:39,769 --> 00:35:41,771
Not that quickly, hon.

573
00:35:41,837 --> 00:35:45,174
It comes in 48 flavors.
We have to try them all.

574
00:35:48,444 --> 00:35:50,179
Uh, I don't know
if we have time.

575
00:35:50,246 --> 00:35:52,948
Why? This place is open
all night. Right, sir?

576
00:35:53,015 --> 00:35:54,015
Yes.

577
00:35:58,621 --> 00:35:59,955
Johnny, look.

578
00:36:00,022 --> 00:36:03,159
They're making a TV
show about this place and we're the stars.

579
00:36:03,225 --> 00:36:04,527
Hello, world.

580
00:36:04,593 --> 00:36:05,995
Awesome.

581
00:36:06,062 --> 00:36:09,665
It's totally awesome.
You're so lucky, Kal.

582
00:36:10,733 --> 00:36:12,268
Hello, world.

583
00:36:15,805 --> 00:36:17,673
Okay, Murray. Your turn.

584
00:36:19,108 --> 00:36:22,578
Excuse us. Do you know where someone
can get a bite around here?

585
00:36:22,645 --> 00:36:25,848
Did you seriously just ask a vampire
where to get a bite?

586
00:36:25,915 --> 00:36:28,384
Oh, gosh. I didn't mean
We're not from around here.

587
00:36:28,451 --> 00:36:30,853
This is so embarrassing.
Just keep going.

588
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,855
Sorry to bother you.
Love your chocolate cereal.

589
00:36:36,392 --> 00:36:38,294
So, what do you
want me to do now?

590
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,062
Denisovich,
you won't believe it.

591
00:36:40,129 --> 00:36:42,398
The mummy can
crash through walls

592
00:36:42,465 --> 00:36:44,400
and turn into
a swarm of beetles

593
00:36:44,467 --> 00:36:46,735
and put a curse on anyone.

594
00:36:46,802 --> 00:36:48,237
That sounds mean.

595
00:36:48,304 --> 00:36:49,839
It's fun mean. Okay.

596
00:36:49,905 --> 00:36:51,507
So, check it out.

597
00:36:51,574 --> 00:36:56,111
Murray's going to conjure up
the biggest sandstorm you've ever seen.

598
00:36:56,178 --> 00:36:57,847
Hit it!

599
00:36:57,913 --> 00:36:59,582
Sandstorm?
It's been awhile.

600
00:36:59,648 --> 00:37:01,617
Not my problem.
Do it. Say your little spell.

601
00:37:01,684 --> 00:37:04,386
Okay.

602
00:37:04,453 --> 00:37:08,190
I got this. Frank, Wayne, Griffin,
just try not to faint.

603
00:37:29,245 --> 00:37:30,245
Ow!

604
00:37:30,279 --> 00:37:31,514
My back.

605
00:37:40,623 --> 00:37:41,891
Oh. Wait.

606
00:37:48,297 --> 00:37:49,899
How cute!

607
00:37:50,966 --> 00:37:52,635
Ow! Ow!

608
00:37:56,872 --> 00:38:00,242
Wait. Stop at that playground.
Look at these cute kids.

609
00:38:06,949 --> 00:38:09,852
Holy rabies!
This looks like a blast.

610
00:38:09,919 --> 00:38:11,287
I don't know, Mavey.

611
00:38:11,353 --> 00:38:14,189
This can be pretty dangerous
if you don't know what you're doing.

612
00:38:14,256 --> 00:38:15,925
Of course, I rock these bikes.

613
00:38:15,991 --> 00:38:17,359
May I, little dude?

614
00:38:18,193 --> 00:38:20,796
Check it out. Oh, yeah.

615
00:38:20,863 --> 00:38:22,865
This is how I rolled every summer.

616
00:38:24,934 --> 00:38:26,902
Whoo-hoo!

617
00:38:26,969 --> 00:38:27,969
Whoa, whoa!

618
00:38:37,346 --> 00:38:38,747
I think I scratched it.

619
00:38:38,814 --> 00:38:39,815
Oh

620
00:38:39,882 --> 00:38:41,483
My turn.

621
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:44,486
Mavey, I told you,
it took me years to get this good.

622
00:38:44,553 --> 00:38:46,522
Well, I'll give it a try.

623
00:39:25,661 --> 00:39:28,364
You feel me now?
That's my girlfriend, suckers.

624
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:29,765
Your wife, Johnny.

625
00:39:29,832 --> 00:39:31,533
My wife. Even better.

626
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:35,237
That was sick, lady.
Where did you learn how to do that stuff?

627
00:39:35,304 --> 00:39:36,672
Transylvania.

628
00:39:36,739 --> 00:39:40,009
That's cool. I have a cousin
from Pennsylvania.

629
00:39:40,075 --> 00:39:43,779
Oh. These little guys are so sweet.
Dennis would love them.

630
00:39:43,846 --> 00:39:45,547
What an awesome
place to raise a kid.

631
00:39:45,614 --> 00:39:47,483
Oh. To raise a kid?

632
00:39:47,549 --> 00:39:49,418
I don't know about awesome.

633
00:39:49,485 --> 00:39:52,554
Maybe tubular. Capisce?

634
00:39:52,621 --> 00:39:54,256
Anyways, we should
hit my folks' place.

635
00:39:54,323 --> 00:39:55,190
I said we'd be there by now.

636
00:39:55,257 --> 00:39:56,625
Sure.

637
00:39:56,692 --> 00:39:58,827
Oh, hey, it's after
3:00 o'clock in Transylvania.

638
00:39:58,894 --> 00:40:00,796
I'm gonna check
on Dennis, okay?

639
00:40:05,801 --> 00:40:08,604
Chocolate cereal.
Are you kidding me?

640
00:40:08,671 --> 00:40:10,806
It's okay, Drac.
It's 'cause they love us.

641
00:40:10,873 --> 00:40:13,308
Yeah.
Monsters are what's goin' on.

642
00:40:13,375 --> 00:40:15,477
Oh, yeah.
You should embrace it like I did.

643
00:40:15,544 --> 00:40:17,513
I've got a best selling workout video.

644
00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:20,215
Follow me, ladies.
Right. And left.

645
00:40:20,282 --> 00:40:22,951
No, girls. Watch me.
You're not watching.

646
00:40:23,018 --> 00:40:25,954
Here we go. And eight
and seven and six

647
00:40:26,021 --> 00:40:27,723
That's not me, guys.

648
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:31,160
Come on, even Bigfoot's tearin' it up
in the German soccer league.

649
00:40:39,134 --> 00:40:41,014
Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no.

650
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:43,138
It's Mavis.

651
00:40:43,205 --> 00:40:44,940
You gotta answer it.

652
00:40:45,007 --> 00:40:46,542
You're pushin' too hard.
Lighter.

653
00:40:46,608 --> 00:40:48,644
All right!

654
00:40:48,711 --> 00:40:51,647
Denisovich, wake up.
Oh, boy, he's out cold.

655
00:40:51,714 --> 00:40:52,848
I got this.

656
00:40:55,617 --> 00:40:56,885
Dad, what took so long?

657
00:40:56,952 --> 00:40:58,253
What?

658
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:01,623
Nothing, Mavey.
We're all great here at the hotel.

659
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:03,692
Just doing hotel things.

660
00:41:03,759 --> 00:41:05,060
Sorry, can't handle your breath.

661
00:41:05,127 --> 00:41:06,595
I hear ya.

662
00:41:06,662 --> 00:41:08,130
How are you?

663
00:41:08,197 --> 00:41:09,732
We're having a blast.

664
00:41:09,798 --> 00:41:12,868
We just went biking and mini marting.
It's so fun here.

665
00:41:13,602 --> 00:41:15,037
Is Dennis okay?

666
00:41:15,104 --> 00:41:16,338
Oh. Of course.

667
00:41:16,405 --> 00:41:18,173
You want to see him?

668
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,042
Yes. Yes, I do.

669
00:41:20,109 --> 00:41:21,410
Hi, baby. How are you?

670
00:41:21,477 --> 00:41:23,045
Mommy.

671
00:41:23,112 --> 00:41:24,112
I happy.

672
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:25,714
Aw.

673
00:41:25,781 --> 00:41:27,483
Hey, little dude.

674
00:41:27,549 --> 00:41:29,118
Why is he wearing sunglasses?

675
00:41:29,184 --> 00:41:31,253
Oh, we were playing.

676
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:34,089
It's a superhero thing.

677
00:41:34,156 --> 00:41:37,593
Cebause,
I'm Sunglasses Man, to the rescue!

678
00:41:37,659 --> 00:41:39,261
Okay, take it down a notch.
I'm flying.

679
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:41,864
You sound funny.

680
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:45,000
Oh, no, no, that's his
Sunglasses Man voice.

681
00:41:45,067 --> 00:41:47,803
Static. The signal is bad.
Mavis, are you there?

682
00:41:49,304 --> 00:41:50,304
Yeah, I'm still

683
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,176
All right.
I guess he's having fun.

684
00:41:54,243 --> 00:41:55,944
Of course he is.

685
00:41:57,946 --> 00:42:00,315
Wow, I nailed it
with the Sunglasses Man.

686
00:42:00,382 --> 00:42:01,984
Right off the top of my head.

687
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:04,019
I threw in a "cebause."
Did everyone see that?

688
00:42:04,086 --> 00:42:06,855
She said she was having fun.
Johnny's blowing it.

689
00:42:06,922 --> 00:42:10,159
She's biking and mini marting.
She's gonna wanna move!

690
00:42:10,225 --> 00:42:13,061
I gotta fix this kid now.
Are we almost there or what?

691
00:42:13,128 --> 00:42:15,030
Okay, I may

692
00:42:15,097 --> 00:42:16,698
have taken a wrong
turn a few miles back.

693
00:42:16,765 --> 00:42:18,567
Don't get mad.
What?

694
00:42:20,669 --> 00:42:22,838
Someone turn on
the navigator on this thing.

695
00:42:22,905 --> 00:42:24,873
Look how light I touch it.

696
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:27,876
Please enter your destination.

697
00:42:27,943 --> 00:42:31,580
Please. I am begging you.

698
00:42:34,249 --> 00:42:36,718
Yeah, this is gonna
be good, Denisovich.

699
00:42:36,785 --> 00:42:39,655
Scary stuff, okay?
It's in you.

700
00:42:39,721 --> 00:42:42,491
We just gotta
concentrate on the scary.

701
00:42:42,558 --> 00:42:45,327
Papa Drac?
Do you miss Grandma?

702
00:42:45,394 --> 00:42:48,163
Miss Grandma?
Oh. Sure, I do.

703
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:52,501
I miss her every day.
She was my zing.

704
00:42:53,435 --> 00:42:54,903
Why do you ask?

705
00:42:54,970 --> 00:42:56,371
I don't know.

706
00:42:56,438 --> 00:42:58,407
Do you miss anybody?

707
00:42:58,473 --> 00:43:00,576
I miss Mommy and Daddy.

708
00:43:00,642 --> 00:43:03,412
And who else?
You miss that Winnie?

709
00:43:03,478 --> 00:43:06,582
The pup who tackles you
and tries to lick you all the time?

710
00:43:06,648 --> 00:43:08,884
Yeah, but we're just friends.

711
00:43:08,951 --> 00:43:11,753
Oh, no, no, no.
You're a Dracula.

712
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:15,624
You can't just be friends with a cute,
hairy number like Winnie.

713
00:43:15,691 --> 00:43:21,296
Right turn, now!
Here. You imbecile!

714
00:43:21,363 --> 00:43:22,431
Oh, right. Turn, Griffin!

715
00:43:22,497 --> 00:43:23,665
Yes, Papa Drac.

716
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:33,542
Wait and see, fellas. This kid'll be guzzling
goat blood in no time.

717
00:43:33,609 --> 00:43:36,979
You have arrived at your destination.
Yes!

718
00:43:37,045 --> 00:43:38,847
Yes!
Here we are.

719
00:43:38,914 --> 00:43:41,283
It's the vampire summer camp
I went to as a kid.

720
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:43,752
What's it, Camp Vamp?

721
00:43:43,819 --> 00:43:45,888
No. Who names
their camp "Camp Vamp?"

722
00:43:45,954 --> 00:43:48,123
It's Camp Winnepacaca.

723
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:10,412
You see, Denisovich?

724
00:44:10,479 --> 00:44:14,549
This is where I learned
to catch mice and shapeshift.

725
00:44:14,616 --> 00:44:18,287
And use my incredible powers and strength.
It's pretty cool. Huh?

726
00:44:18,353 --> 00:44:19,353
Badminton.

727
00:44:23,892 --> 00:44:27,195
Yes, I don't
remember this badminting.

728
00:44:27,262 --> 00:44:30,232
Well, well, is this a night?
How ya doin', folks?

729
00:44:30,299 --> 00:44:32,100
I'm Dana, the director.

730
00:44:32,167 --> 00:44:34,636
We're sure excited to have you
legends visitin' us.

731
00:44:34,703 --> 00:44:36,672
What can I do you for?

732
00:44:36,738 --> 00:44:41,476
Well, I'm very interested
in sending my grandboy, Denisovich, here.

733
00:44:41,543 --> 00:44:46,014
Oh. This little redheaded,
non-fangy little guy?

734
00:44:46,081 --> 00:44:49,551
Oh, they're in there. He's a late fanger.
That's why we came here.

735
00:44:49,618 --> 00:44:51,753
Can you show us
some of the drills,

736
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:53,889
like where they
catch the mice?

737
00:44:53,956 --> 00:44:56,925
Can do.
A- course now we call it Tee Mousing.

738
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:10,439
So they don't have
to catch the mice?

739
00:45:10,505 --> 00:45:13,976
Nope. We find this is a good way
to build their confidence.

740
00:45:15,777 --> 00:45:16,845
Come here.

741
00:45:18,146 --> 00:45:19,906
It's right there!
What's the matter with you?

742
00:45:21,683 --> 00:45:22,951
Hokey pokey.

743
00:45:24,586 --> 00:45:26,121
Ah!

744
00:45:26,188 --> 00:45:29,558
There it is, Denisovich.
Where Papa learned to fly.

745
00:45:29,624 --> 00:45:31,660
Ooh! I wanna fly like Papa.

746
00:45:37,099 --> 00:45:38,266
Uh

747
00:45:38,333 --> 00:45:40,068
Yeah. We're over here, now.

748
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:43,972
Had to scale it down.
Insurance.

749
00:45:47,709 --> 00:45:49,978
Help me. Help me. Help me.

750
00:45:50,045 --> 00:45:52,981
Hokey pokey.
See ya at the campfire.

751
00:45:57,853 --> 00:46:00,489
Well, gosh! Welcome, you two.

752
00:46:00,555 --> 00:46:01,723
Hey, gang.

753
00:46:01,790 --> 00:46:04,660
Hi, guys. This is so exciting.

754
00:46:04,726 --> 00:46:08,864
Ah!
Look at all of this. So cool.

755
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:11,466
Wow! I can't
believe I'm actually here.

756
00:46:11,533 --> 00:46:12,834
Well, you are.

757
00:46:12,901 --> 00:46:16,204
Now, how does it work?
Are you up all night and sleep all day?

758
00:46:16,271 --> 00:46:17,572
Yeah.

759
00:46:17,639 --> 00:46:18,640
Oh. I'll do
whatever you guys want.

760
00:46:18,707 --> 00:46:20,242
Good.

761
00:46:20,308 --> 00:46:22,878
'Cause I bought this
pretty sunhat for you. Linda.

762
00:46:22,944 --> 00:46:24,880
But otherwise this poncho,
if you wanna be safe.

763
00:46:24,946 --> 00:46:26,715
We can deal with
it later, Linda.

764
00:46:26,782 --> 00:46:27,716
Okay.

765
00:46:27,783 --> 00:46:29,451
Oh! Come see.

766
00:46:30,619 --> 00:46:32,320
I've set up your bedroom.

767
00:46:36,291 --> 00:46:39,428
It's just like Transylvania.

768
00:46:39,494 --> 00:46:42,964
Oh, Transylvania.
That was a fun experience.

769
00:46:43,031 --> 00:46:45,100
Mike was afraid he'd get
disemboweled and eaten,

770
00:46:45,167 --> 00:46:47,102
but I told him he
was just being silly.

771
00:46:47,169 --> 00:46:48,809
That was you, Linda.

772
00:46:49,171 --> 00:46:51,073
Oh. There they are.

773
00:46:51,139 --> 00:46:53,909
You know, we have a couple
of mixed families in the neighborhood,

774
00:46:53,975 --> 00:46:55,877
so I thought I'd
invite them over.

775
00:46:55,944 --> 00:46:57,979
They might be nice
for you guys to talk to

776
00:46:58,046 --> 00:46:59,781
since you're
thinkin' about moving here.

777
00:47:01,516 --> 00:47:03,652
Hi, Caren.
Hi, Pandragora.

778
00:47:03,718 --> 00:47:05,220
Welcome, Mavis.
Hey, guys.

779
00:47:06,788 --> 00:47:10,025
Yeah, you're gonna dig it here.
Don't even worry.

780
00:47:10,092 --> 00:47:13,428
People are totally cool
with our lifestyle choice.

781
00:47:13,495 --> 00:47:14,796
I mean, the kids get picked on a little,

782
00:47:14,863 --> 00:47:17,065
but it toughens them up.

783
00:47:17,132 --> 00:47:18,932
Oh, hey, you guys.
And this is Loretta.

784
00:47:18,967 --> 00:47:20,936
She's married to Paul,
who's a werewolf.

785
00:47:21,002 --> 00:47:22,604
Excuse me?

786
00:47:22,671 --> 00:47:26,108
Yes, I was telling Mavis about the other
monster human couples in town.

787
00:47:26,174 --> 00:47:28,009
I am not a werewolf.

788
00:47:28,076 --> 00:47:30,679
Oh. I thought

789
00:47:30,745 --> 00:47:33,348
Well, you're welcome to stay
and have some cupcakes.

790
00:47:36,985 --> 00:47:41,056
Vampires will be friends forever

791
00:47:41,123 --> 00:47:45,260
Through the centuries together

792
00:47:45,327 --> 00:47:49,531
Even in the brightest sunny weather

793
00:47:49,598 --> 00:47:53,735
Vampires will be friends forever

794
00:47:53,802 --> 00:47:57,339
Literally

795
00:47:57,405 --> 00:48:00,709
Forever

796
00:48:04,546 --> 00:48:07,315
Great job, vampires.
Give yourselves a hug.

797
00:48:07,382 --> 00:48:08,382
Mmm

798
00:48:13,421 --> 00:48:14,456
We're going.

799
00:48:14,523 --> 00:48:15,523
What? Where?

800
00:48:21,897 --> 00:48:23,331
Why are we doing this?

801
00:48:23,398 --> 00:48:26,201
You'd rather be listening
to those putrid new songs?

802
00:48:26,268 --> 00:48:28,303
What happened to Michael Row
Your Corpse Ashore?

803
00:48:28,370 --> 00:48:30,939
Or Old McWerewolf Had An Axe?

804
00:48:36,344 --> 00:48:38,180
We shouldn't be up here, Drac.

805
00:48:38,246 --> 00:48:40,248
Who's ready to fly?

806
00:48:40,315 --> 00:48:42,517
Me! Me! Like a superhero.

807
00:48:42,584 --> 00:48:44,386
Better! Like a vampire!

808
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:47,222
This thing is rickety.

809
00:48:47,289 --> 00:48:49,591
You know what?
Maybe the kid isn't supposed to fly.

810
00:48:49,658 --> 00:48:52,928
Quiet. This is how they learn.
You throw them and they figure it out.

811
00:48:53,895 --> 00:48:55,463
It's how I was taught.

812
00:48:55,530 --> 00:48:56,898
I wanna fly now!

813
00:48:56,965 --> 00:49:00,302
Attabat. You know Papa's right here
if you need him.

814
00:49:00,368 --> 00:49:01,803
Uh. I can't watch this.

815
00:49:01,870 --> 00:49:03,371
Please don't.

816
00:49:03,438 --> 00:49:05,907
Here we go!

817
00:49:05,974 --> 00:49:06,974
Wee!

818
00:49:12,247 --> 00:49:13,515
He's still not flying.

819
00:49:13,582 --> 00:49:14,583
He will.

820
00:49:15,917 --> 00:49:17,385
Still not.

821
00:49:17,452 --> 00:49:18,452
It'll happen.

822
00:49:19,621 --> 00:49:20,989
This is a tall tower.

823
00:49:21,056 --> 00:49:22,524
That's why it's good.

824
00:49:22,591 --> 00:49:23,858
You should get him.

825
00:49:23,925 --> 00:49:24,993
He's gonna fall to his death.

826
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:26,928
He's taking his time.

827
00:49:28,396 --> 00:49:29,898
Drac!

828
00:49:29,965 --> 00:49:31,866
I did that my first time.

829
00:49:31,933 --> 00:49:33,535
He's getting too
close to the ground!

830
00:49:34,936 --> 00:49:36,338
You know what?
He's not gonna fly.

831
00:49:43,912 --> 00:49:44,913
Ah.

832
00:49:46,982 --> 00:49:49,985
I told you.
Papa's always here for you.

833
00:49:50,051 --> 00:49:52,320
Again! Again!

834
00:49:52,387 --> 00:49:55,056
Oh, dear. Oh, my devil.
We're gonna have to report this.

835
00:49:55,123 --> 00:49:56,691
You mean to the papers?

836
00:49:56,758 --> 00:50:00,128
I guess it was pretty cool,
but I'm not about getting press.

837
00:50:00,195 --> 00:50:02,664
No, sir.
I mean the authorities.

838
00:50:02,731 --> 00:50:05,166
I can't not report
child endangerment.

839
00:50:05,233 --> 00:50:08,003
Whoa!
Listen to me. That was fun.

840
00:50:08,069 --> 00:50:10,438
Your singing is
child endangerment.

841
00:50:10,505 --> 00:50:12,507
Should we go
down and help him?

842
00:50:12,574 --> 00:50:15,410
Nope. I told him this was nuts.
He's on his own.

843
00:50:15,477 --> 00:50:16,978
We have to call
the boy's mother.

844
00:50:17,045 --> 00:50:18,580
No, that ain't happening.

845
00:50:18,647 --> 00:50:21,216
His mother's
already nutsy koo koo!

846
00:50:21,283 --> 00:50:23,885
I have to follow protocol.

847
00:50:23,952 --> 00:50:27,522
You will not follow protocol.

848
00:50:27,589 --> 00:50:29,524
I'm a vampire.
I can't be hypnotized.

849
00:50:30,325 --> 00:50:31,526
Right.

850
00:50:31,593 --> 00:50:34,095
Now, please. Don't
make me call the police.

851
00:50:34,162 --> 00:50:35,964
No one's calling nobody!

852
00:50:37,899 --> 00:50:38,899
Aah!

853
00:50:38,933 --> 00:50:40,502
Fire!

854
00:50:40,568 --> 00:50:43,371
Stop, drop and roll.
Stop, drop and roll.

855
00:50:43,438 --> 00:50:44,773
Screaming's not helping!

856
00:50:44,839 --> 00:50:45,839
Yay!

857
00:50:53,448 --> 00:50:55,250
Are we bad guys, Papa Drac?

858
00:50:55,884 --> 00:50:56,884
Bad?

859
00:50:58,687 --> 00:51:01,456
No. You're
the best kid in the world.

860
00:51:01,523 --> 00:51:04,859
We didn't start the fire.
It was the tower.

861
00:51:04,926 --> 00:51:09,397
That's a very unsafe tower.
You're lucky we don't call the authorities.

862
00:51:09,464 --> 00:51:11,266
Let's go, my hero.

863
00:51:11,333 --> 00:51:14,069
Cebause I'm Batman!
To the Batmobile!

864
00:51:14,135 --> 00:51:15,637
Yes. To the

865
00:51:27,115 --> 00:51:29,751
Sorry about all that stuff.
I guess they thought you'd like it.

866
00:51:29,818 --> 00:51:31,920
Why do I feel so weird here?

867
00:51:31,986 --> 00:51:34,122
No, hon. They're being weird.

868
00:51:34,189 --> 00:51:36,591
I think they're
just trying to help me.

869
00:51:36,658 --> 00:51:40,128
I mean, I grew up knowing nothing
living inside that hotel.

870
00:51:40,195 --> 00:51:43,131
And you learned about everything
growing up in Santa Claus.

871
00:51:43,198 --> 00:51:45,667
Santa Cruz. But, uh

872
00:51:45,734 --> 00:51:48,503
Maybe if Dennis grows up
away from Transylvania,

873
00:51:48,570 --> 00:51:52,540
he won't be so freaky.
Like me.

874
00:51:52,607 --> 00:51:56,077
Are you nuts?
Mavis, you're a blast.

875
00:51:56,144 --> 00:51:58,980
You're so full of life
and curious about everything.

876
00:51:59,047 --> 00:52:01,282
If Dennis grows up
to be just like you,

877
00:52:01,349 --> 00:52:03,451
I'll be the luckiest dad in the world.

878
00:52:03,518 --> 00:52:06,588
I love you, Johnnystein.

879
00:52:06,654 --> 00:52:07,989
You know what?

880
00:52:08,056 --> 00:52:10,959
As long as we're all together,
we'll be happy anywhere.

881
00:52:11,026 --> 00:52:12,494
Even at the hotel.

882
00:52:13,661 --> 00:52:15,263
Yes!

883
00:52:17,732 --> 00:52:19,067
What are you doing?

884
00:52:19,134 --> 00:52:21,603
Check out this
video my friend sent me.

885
00:52:21,669 --> 00:52:23,671
This kid is
an awesome daredevil.

886
00:52:24,773 --> 00:52:25,907
Ah.

887
00:52:25,974 --> 00:52:26,875
Oh, dude!

888
00:52:26,941 --> 00:52:28,009
Did you get it?

889
00:52:28,076 --> 00:52:29,310
Wait! Is that Dennis?

890
00:52:29,377 --> 00:52:34,082
No! Is it? No. It's just hard to see.
But

891
00:52:34,149 --> 00:52:36,651
Oops. Just deleted it.
So, it's gone.

892
00:52:47,228 --> 00:52:49,297
What? It's Mavis.
I'm not answering it.

893
00:52:51,332 --> 00:52:53,301
Come on, Drac. You have to.

894
00:52:55,904 --> 00:52:57,572
All right!

895
00:52:57,639 --> 00:52:59,140
Yes, honeybunch.

896
00:52:59,207 --> 00:53:00,809
Dad? Where are you?

897
00:53:00,875 --> 00:53:04,846
Um We're outside the hotel
having a little cookout.

898
00:53:04,913 --> 00:53:06,548
It's perfectly safe.

899
00:53:06,614 --> 00:53:08,149
What's that noise?
Is that a siren?

900
00:53:08,216 --> 00:53:11,386
Oh, those are just
some wailing banshees checking in.

901
00:53:11,453 --> 00:53:13,254
Quiet, you banshees.

902
00:53:13,321 --> 00:53:16,057
We're trying to have a perfectly safe
cookout over here.

903
00:53:16,124 --> 00:53:19,727
Mommy!
I wanna say hi! Mommy! Mommy!

904
00:53:19,794 --> 00:53:21,229
Papa Drac just tried
to teach me how to fly.

905
00:53:21,296 --> 00:53:22,730
Wait a minute.
Is that the mother?

906
00:53:22,797 --> 00:53:24,232
Oh, no. Static again.

907
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:27,435
I am coming back to
the hotel right now.

908
00:53:27,502 --> 00:53:31,606
And you better be there or I swear, Dad,
you're gonna be very sorry.

909
00:53:32,407 --> 00:53:34,375
What's goin' on?

910
00:53:34,442 --> 00:53:35,677
We need to get
home right away.

911
00:53:35,743 --> 00:53:36,743
Whoa!

912
00:53:38,146 --> 00:53:40,782
Okay.
I'll go wake up my backpack.

913
00:53:40,849 --> 00:53:42,383
Guys, we gotta move.

914
00:53:42,450 --> 00:53:44,819
We got no car!
How we gonna get out of here?

915
00:53:44,886 --> 00:53:46,387
Don't worry.
I made a call.

916
00:53:55,897 --> 00:53:58,867
I'm sorry, Blobby.
We really meant to call you sooner.

917
00:54:05,406 --> 00:54:06,641
Hit it!

918
00:54:21,956 --> 00:54:23,057
Transylvania.

919
00:54:23,124 --> 00:54:24,459
You want to go where?

920
00:54:24,526 --> 00:54:25,894
Transylvania.
As soon as possible.

921
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:27,962
We don't fly
direct to Transylvania.

922
00:54:28,029 --> 00:54:29,397
You don't?

923
00:54:29,464 --> 00:54:31,666
You can go to Bucharest,
but you'll have to

924
00:54:31,733 --> 00:54:33,568
switch planes in
Chicago and then Zurich.

925
00:54:33,635 --> 00:54:35,303
So, when would we get there?

926
00:54:35,370 --> 00:54:38,373
Well, the Chicago flight's delayed
due to bad weather.

927
00:54:43,945 --> 00:54:45,547
So, two seats in coach?

928
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:46,980
No!

929
00:54:47,515 --> 00:54:48,950
No!
Yes.

930
00:55:09,070 --> 00:55:12,040
You have to go now?
When we finally have no traffic.

931
00:55:12,106 --> 00:55:13,708
You're killing me, Blobby.

932
00:55:23,718 --> 00:55:26,721
I still have some cloud on me.
Gotta do a selfie!

933
00:55:26,788 --> 00:55:28,289
Johnny! Not now!

934
00:55:28,356 --> 00:55:29,591
Okay. Maybe later.

935
00:55:35,930 --> 00:55:38,399
This scooter thing's out of juice.
We're never gonna make it.

936
00:55:38,466 --> 00:55:39,901
Frank, blow.

937
00:55:49,344 --> 00:55:50,445
Now!

938
00:56:13,334 --> 00:56:16,537
How fun is this?
Why are you laughing? You like that?

939
00:56:16,604 --> 00:56:17,872
Watch this.

940
00:56:19,674 --> 00:56:21,114
Coochie coochie coochie coo!

941
00:56:29,751 --> 00:56:31,552
Now this is flying,
Denisovich.

942
00:56:31,619 --> 00:56:33,755
Like a vampire.

943
00:56:35,223 --> 00:56:36,223
Wee!

944
00:56:37,425 --> 00:56:40,128
That's my boy. Look at you go.

945
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:52,540
You're the coolest guy
who wears a cape, Papa Drac.

946
00:57:04,919 --> 00:57:05,919
Ugh!

947
00:57:21,235 --> 00:57:23,938
So, hey, when are you going
to get here already?

948
00:57:24,005 --> 00:57:25,606
We've been waiting

949
00:57:27,642 --> 00:57:29,777
Give me my son.

950
00:57:29,844 --> 00:57:32,213
We just went out
for some avocados.

951
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:33,748
Mommy! I flew!

952
00:57:33,815 --> 00:57:35,450
I saw.

953
00:57:35,516 --> 00:57:37,452
Mother's already nutsy koo koo

954
00:57:37,518 --> 00:57:40,088
Nutsy koo koo

955
00:57:40,154 --> 00:57:41,914
Koo koo
Oh, dear. Oh, dear

956
00:57:41,956 --> 00:57:43,658
Oh, my devil
I have to follow protocol

957
00:57:43,725 --> 00:57:45,485
That ain't happening
That ain't happening

958
00:57:45,526 --> 00:57:46,928
Mother's already

959
00:57:46,994 --> 00:57:47,994
Koo koo

960
00:57:49,097 --> 00:57:50,097
Koo koo

961
00:57:58,072 --> 00:58:01,442
I was worried Dennis wasn't safe
around other monsters.

962
00:58:01,509 --> 00:58:04,512
Now I don't even feel like
he's safe around you.

963
00:58:04,579 --> 00:58:05,747
But I was just

964
00:58:05,813 --> 00:58:07,181
What was it you said?

965
00:58:07,248 --> 00:58:10,651
Human, monster, unicorn.
That it didn't matter?

966
00:58:10,718 --> 00:58:12,854
Well, I just know his life would

967
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:15,323
We'll have his birthday party
here on Wednesday.

968
00:58:15,389 --> 00:58:17,291
Then we're moving.

969
00:58:17,358 --> 00:58:20,194
Please, Mavey. Don't leave.

970
00:58:20,261 --> 00:58:23,397
Maybe you've let humans
into your hotel, Dad.

971
00:58:23,464 --> 00:58:25,633
But I don't think you've let them
into your heart.

972
00:58:57,398 --> 00:58:58,398
Hmm

973
00:59:10,244 --> 00:59:12,780
I can do it.
I can do it.

974
00:59:13,481 --> 00:59:16,784
I'm a bat. I'm a bat.

975
00:59:16,851 --> 00:59:18,786
I'm a bat.
I'm a bat. I'm a bat!

976
00:59:18,853 --> 00:59:20,521
Dennis?
What are you doing, sweetie?

977
00:59:20,588 --> 00:59:22,757
Uh Nothing.

978
00:59:22,824 --> 00:59:25,827
Careful. Let me help
you down from there.

979
00:59:25,893 --> 00:59:27,995
Are you getting
excited about your big party?

980
00:59:28,062 --> 00:59:29,864
I guess so.

981
00:59:29,931 --> 00:59:32,867
You know who's coming?
Daddy's whole family.

982
00:59:32,934 --> 00:59:35,169
Grandpa Mike
and Grandma Linda.

983
00:59:35,236 --> 00:59:38,973
All your cousins and aunts and uncles
who love you so much.

984
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:43,044
And then they're gonna be with us
when we move to California.

985
00:59:43,110 --> 00:59:47,682
Mommy, are we going away
cebause I'm not a monster?

986
00:59:47,748 --> 00:59:51,285
What?
No. Dennis, of course not.

987
00:59:51,352 --> 00:59:53,888
It's just grown up stuff.

988
00:59:53,955 --> 00:59:56,524
Okay.
But what about Papa Drac?

989
00:59:56,591 --> 00:59:59,126
He's gonna be here all alone.

990
00:59:59,193 --> 01:00:02,096
Papa Drac has to stay
here to run the hotel.

991
01:00:02,163 --> 01:00:04,699
But he'll visit us.
And we'll visit him.

992
01:00:04,765 --> 01:00:06,300
Can we call him every night?

993
01:00:06,367 --> 01:00:07,902
Sure.

994
01:00:13,574 --> 01:00:15,209
Awesome!

995
01:00:15,276 --> 01:00:17,111
Hello. We're here.

996
01:00:19,313 --> 01:00:24,719
The night brings
Johnny's family here

997
01:00:24,785 --> 01:00:29,423
To take away all
that Drac holds dear

998
01:00:29,490 --> 01:00:30,558
Welcome, welcome.

999
01:00:30,625 --> 01:00:32,827
Hide your feelings

1000
01:00:32,894 --> 01:00:36,564
Keep them all inside

1001
01:00:43,671 --> 01:00:46,407
Dude, why do you wanna leave?
This place is out of control.

1002
01:00:46,474 --> 01:00:47,775
I don't wanna leave.

1003
01:00:47,842 --> 01:00:49,877
All these awesome
freakazoids!

1004
01:00:49,944 --> 01:00:51,379
So, who's the
coolest monster?

1005
01:00:51,445 --> 01:00:54,649
Kakie.

1006
01:00:54,715 --> 01:00:55,995
Kakie.
What a wussbag.

1007
01:00:56,984 --> 01:01:00,454
Isn't it nice to have
the whole family together?

1008
01:01:00,521 --> 01:01:04,558
Mavis, do you have any cousins or
thingies in your family?

1009
01:01:04,625 --> 01:01:06,761
No. It's just been me and Dad.

1010
01:01:06,827 --> 01:01:09,463
I never did ask how
you lost your mom.

1011
01:01:09,530 --> 01:01:11,532
Oh. She was
killed by angry humans.

1012
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:12,767
Oh

1013
01:01:12,833 --> 01:01:15,670
Awkward

1014
01:01:15,736 --> 01:01:18,005
But there is my Grandpa Vlad.

1015
01:01:18,072 --> 01:01:19,540
Oh, you have a grandpa?

1016
01:01:19,607 --> 01:01:21,287
Yeah. He'll be at the party.
I invited him.

1017
01:01:22,743 --> 01:01:24,779
You invited him?

1018
01:01:24,845 --> 01:01:28,649
Dad, he's never seen Dennis.
I wanted them to meet once before we go.

1019
01:01:28,716 --> 01:01:32,987
Sure.
Great. Peachy. Good old Vlad.

1020
01:01:33,054 --> 01:01:35,022
Anybody have a wet wipe?

1021
01:01:52,873 --> 01:01:57,178
Holy rabies.
He finally invites me to something.

1022
01:01:57,244 --> 01:01:58,679
He's got a grandkid?

1023
01:01:58,746 --> 01:02:00,514
And he never told you?

1024
01:02:00,581 --> 01:02:04,919
Easy, Bela. At least there's
another vampire in the family.

1025
01:02:04,986 --> 01:02:07,555
It's at a hotel?
Fancy schmancy.

1026
01:02:07,621 --> 01:02:10,725
Hotels are for humans!

1027
01:02:15,963 --> 01:02:18,599
Bela, shut your blood hole.
Look what you started.

1028
01:02:18,666 --> 01:02:20,601
Don't worry, gang.

1029
01:02:20,668 --> 01:02:23,938
I raised my son to hate and kill
and steal the souls of humans

1030
01:02:24,005 --> 01:02:26,073
like a good boy.

1031
01:02:26,140 --> 01:02:29,410
Yes,
Grandpa Vlad will be so happy

1032
01:02:29,477 --> 01:02:33,814
when he sees the big masquerade party
Johnny and I have planned.

1033
01:02:33,881 --> 01:02:35,016
What?

1034
01:02:38,552 --> 01:02:40,187
Play along.
It's my dad.

1035
01:02:40,254 --> 01:02:42,023
You have a dad?
That's funny.

1036
01:02:42,089 --> 01:02:44,492
Listen to me. My dad cannot
know you're a human.

1037
01:02:44,558 --> 01:02:46,761
Or any of your family.

1038
01:02:46,827 --> 01:02:49,263
What? But, Drac,
I'm proud that we're

1039
01:02:49,330 --> 01:02:52,099
Or he'll steal your family's souls
and eat your backpack.

1040
01:02:54,635 --> 01:02:56,203
That's right, gang.

1041
01:02:56,270 --> 01:02:59,206
We're gonna make the birthday
a monster masquerade party.

1042
01:03:00,141 --> 01:03:02,376
Really?
Oh, that's lovely.

1043
01:03:02,443 --> 01:03:06,914
Sort of like a last hurrah before Dennis
gets to be with normal people.

1044
01:03:06,981 --> 01:03:09,016
I couldn't have
said it better.

1045
01:03:28,702 --> 01:03:32,339
What do you think, Mavis?
I think I'm starting to like being creepy.

1046
01:03:37,445 --> 01:03:39,980
You're lucky we don't
call the authorities.

1047
01:03:40,047 --> 01:03:41,949
Let's go, my hero.

1048
01:03:42,016 --> 01:03:43,517
Cebause I'm Batman!

1049
01:03:44,718 --> 01:03:46,854
Yes! To the Batmobile!

1050
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:54,880
Got your butt kicked by a girl, Batman.

1051
01:03:57,264 --> 01:03:59,834
Yeah. Whatever.
I'm not about to cry.

1052
01:04:03,404 --> 01:04:06,707
Hotel Transylvania.

1053
01:04:06,774 --> 01:04:10,244
I smell humans!

1054
01:04:10,311 --> 01:04:13,280
Tear it down!

1055
01:04:13,347 --> 01:04:17,885
Bela, we're in the outside world.
You're gonna smell humans.

1056
01:04:17,952 --> 01:04:21,489
You know what? Just wait outside for me.
This is family stuff.

1057
01:04:21,555 --> 01:04:23,157
You'll only get in the way.

1058
01:04:23,224 --> 01:04:25,025
I just wanna meet
the little fanger.

1059
01:04:25,092 --> 01:04:26,560
He should know
his great vampa.

1060
01:04:26,627 --> 01:04:28,295
His what?

1061
01:04:28,362 --> 01:04:31,565
Vampire grandpa. Come on.
That was obvious.

1062
01:04:34,135 --> 01:04:35,769
Amazing party!

1063
01:04:35,836 --> 01:04:38,672
So, what do you think?

1064
01:04:38,739 --> 01:04:41,242
This is your vampire costume?
What are you, nuts?

1065
01:04:41,308 --> 01:04:42,776
I ordered it online.

1066
01:04:42,843 --> 01:04:44,745
It was the only place
that delivered overnight.

1067
01:04:44,812 --> 01:04:47,214
You look like you got
a baboon's butt on your head.

1068
01:04:47,281 --> 01:04:49,216
Have you at least
practiced your voice?

1069
01:04:49,283 --> 01:04:51,285
You can't just
talk like a hippie.

1070
01:04:51,352 --> 01:04:52,987
I'm not a hippie.
I'm a slacker.

1071
01:04:53,053 --> 01:04:55,422
Talk like a vampire.

1072
01:04:55,489 --> 01:05:00,995
My name is Count Jonafang.
I am a vampire.

1073
01:05:01,061 --> 01:05:04,698
Okay, vampires don't go around saying,
"I am a vampire."

1074
01:05:04,765 --> 01:05:09,136
Sorry. I am Count Jonafang.
Bleh, bleh-bleh.

1075
01:05:09,203 --> 01:05:10,604
Are you kidding me?

1076
01:05:10,671 --> 01:05:12,139
I'm sorry. I'm nervous.

1077
01:05:12,206 --> 01:05:14,308
Yeah, listen,
if you think I don't like it,

1078
01:05:14,375 --> 01:05:16,310
you definitely
don't want to say,

1079
01:05:16,377 --> 01:05:18,145
"Bleh, bleh-bleh,"
in front of my father.

1080
01:05:18,212 --> 01:05:19,647
Sir, Master Kakie
has arrived.

1081
01:05:19,713 --> 01:05:21,448
Oh, hey.

1082
01:05:21,515 --> 01:05:24,418
Drac, this is Brandon, a.k.a. Kakie.

1083
01:05:24,485 --> 01:05:26,487
We got him for Dennis.
Hey, man.

1084
01:05:26,554 --> 01:05:28,556
Nauseated to meet you.

1085
01:05:28,622 --> 01:05:30,958
When does this happen?
I got a book fair in half an hour.

1086
01:05:34,829 --> 01:05:37,198
All right. Where's my vampson?

1087
01:05:39,934 --> 01:05:43,037
Oh, please. Still has to make
a dramatic entrance.

1088
01:05:43,103 --> 01:05:45,739
Dad! Look at you!

1089
01:05:45,806 --> 01:05:48,242
So you run a hotel now?

1090
01:05:48,309 --> 01:05:52,079
From Prince of Darkness
to King of Room Service.

1091
01:05:52,146 --> 01:05:54,215
Yes. So good to see you.

1092
01:05:54,281 --> 01:05:56,116
I'll be right with you.

1093
01:06:01,355 --> 01:06:04,225
Keep Vlad away from
the humans and Mavis.

1094
01:06:05,192 --> 01:06:06,260
I'm on it.

1095
01:06:07,194 --> 01:06:10,664
Oh, now that is
a neat costume.

1096
01:06:10,731 --> 01:06:13,200
These two smell funny.

1097
01:06:13,267 --> 01:06:14,868
Oh, you're European.

1098
01:06:14,935 --> 01:06:17,504
It's called deodorant.

1099
01:06:17,571 --> 01:06:20,608
Nothing like insulting
an entire continent, Linda.

1100
01:06:20,674 --> 01:06:22,743
Hey, Count!
How goes it? Frankenstein.

1101
01:06:22,810 --> 01:06:24,979
Actually, I'm technically
Frankenstein's monster.

1102
01:06:25,045 --> 01:06:26,445
Frankenstein,
he's the doctor who

1103
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:29,883
Would love to hear more.
Call my people.

1104
01:06:29,950 --> 01:06:32,350
So, let me introduce you
to some of your son's other buddies.

1105
01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:34,922
This is Murray.

1106
01:06:34,989 --> 01:06:36,657
Please don't kill me!

1107
01:06:36,724 --> 01:06:39,526
I mean, yo, V! What's up?

1108
01:06:39,593 --> 01:06:42,396
Talking toilet paper.
Well, that's a new one.

1109
01:06:43,764 --> 01:06:46,033
All right! Where's the kid?
That's who I wanna meet.

1110
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:47,334
Johnny!

1111
01:06:50,237 --> 01:06:53,107
This is Dracula's son-in-law.

1112
01:06:53,173 --> 01:06:57,011
I am Count Jonafang.

1113
01:06:57,077 --> 01:06:59,480
Bleh, bleh, black sheep.

1114
01:06:59,546 --> 01:07:02,516
Have you any wool?

1115
01:07:02,583 --> 01:07:04,418
What's that
thing on your head?

1116
01:07:04,485 --> 01:07:06,854
Looks like my
grandmother's boobies.

1117
01:07:09,523 --> 01:07:11,592
Daddy, who's the man
with the funny face?

1118
01:07:11,659 --> 01:07:12,860
Is this the kid?

1119
01:07:12,926 --> 01:07:14,094
It sure is.

1120
01:07:14,161 --> 01:07:15,796
Let me see those fangs.

1121
01:07:15,863 --> 01:07:17,097
What are you doin'?

1122
01:07:17,164 --> 01:07:18,999
Oh, I just love him so much.

1123
01:07:19,066 --> 01:07:22,036
I want to hug him
right in the fangs that he has.

1124
01:07:24,305 --> 01:07:27,608
I repeat,
lemme see those fangs.

1125
01:07:37,284 --> 01:07:40,387
Oh, he's a late fanger,
just like you.

1126
01:07:40,454 --> 01:07:42,690
Yes. Yes.
Just like me.

1127
01:07:44,925 --> 01:07:47,628
The big shot here
was a little crybaby, all right.

1128
01:07:47,695 --> 01:07:48,963
Yes, yes, I was.

1129
01:07:49,029 --> 01:07:50,130
Used to pee in his bed.

1130
01:07:50,197 --> 01:07:51,665
Okay, Dad.

1131
01:07:51,732 --> 01:07:54,535
We just need to
scare the fangs out of the kid.

1132
01:07:54,601 --> 01:07:56,236
Hare ha hangs?

1133
01:07:56,303 --> 01:07:58,972
Yeah, it's what I did
for Mr. Tough Guy here.

1134
01:07:59,039 --> 01:08:01,542
First, you've got
to possess something

1135
01:08:01,608 --> 01:08:04,044
the late fanger
finds sweet and innocent.

1136
01:08:04,111 --> 01:08:05,713
Then you show them
what's what and

1137
01:08:05,779 --> 01:08:07,781
Pop!

1138
01:08:07,848 --> 01:08:11,952
Trust me. It'll scare
the fangs right out. Right, Drac?

1139
01:08:12,019 --> 01:08:15,389
Seriously, guys, if I'm late for the
book fair, I'll miss the street fair.

1140
01:08:16,256 --> 01:08:18,592
That's your guy.

1141
01:08:18,659 --> 01:08:21,462
Possessed?
But Dennis will be so upset.

1142
01:08:21,528 --> 01:08:23,630
Don't you get it?
This is our ticket.

1143
01:08:23,697 --> 01:08:26,500
If it works for Denisovich,
boom! He's a vampire.

1144
01:08:26,567 --> 01:08:28,402
And you all get to stay here.

1145
01:08:28,469 --> 01:08:30,137
All right. All right.

1146
01:08:31,171 --> 01:08:33,107
Capisce.
Good call.

1147
01:08:33,172 --> 01:08:36,210
Kids, everyone, have a seat.

1148
01:08:36,275 --> 01:08:38,712
Dennis has a big
surprise for you.

1149
01:08:38,779 --> 01:08:43,117
The one and only Kakie,
The Cake Monster!

1150
01:08:43,183 --> 01:08:47,121
Hey, kids! It's me, Kakie!

1151
01:08:47,186 --> 01:08:50,524
What a wonderful
Kakie day it is!

1152
01:08:50,591 --> 01:08:54,427
Now, I have a question.
Who here loves cake?

1153
01:08:59,933 --> 01:09:00,933
Rise!

1154
01:09:01,735 --> 01:09:02,735
Whoa, whoa

1155
01:09:09,376 --> 01:09:12,079
Why am I floating?
Can I have the stage manager, please?

1156
01:09:12,145 --> 01:09:13,913
This isn't working for me.

1157
01:09:13,980 --> 01:09:14,980
Whoa

1158
01:09:18,351 --> 01:09:20,487
Wow!

1159
01:09:20,554 --> 01:09:23,657
Scary, Denisovich?
You feeling anything? Any change?

1160
01:09:23,724 --> 01:09:25,159
Is Kakie okay?

1161
01:09:27,528 --> 01:09:31,632
I want all the cake.
Sharing is for cowards.

1162
01:09:34,333 --> 01:09:37,738
I don't remember any of this
from the TV show.

1163
01:09:37,805 --> 01:09:40,641
Um I think I saw it
on a Blu-Ray disc, bonus stuff.

1164
01:09:40,707 --> 01:09:42,810
Wait, why is Grandpa Vlad up there?

1165
01:09:49,283 --> 01:09:51,784
I'm scared, Papa.
What's happening to Kakie?

1166
01:09:56,523 --> 01:09:59,927
You don't eat cake.
Cake eat you!

1167
01:09:59,993 --> 01:10:01,428
No!

1168
01:10:01,495 --> 01:10:02,596
Stop it!

1169
01:10:05,999 --> 01:10:08,936
What just happened, man?
I'm outta here.

1170
01:10:09,002 --> 01:10:12,339
None of these parents
better review this on Yelp.

1171
01:10:12,406 --> 01:10:14,208
Hey, what did you just do?

1172
01:10:14,274 --> 01:10:16,743
A few more seconds and the kid's fangs
would have popped right out.

1173
01:10:16,810 --> 01:10:18,345
I don't care.
It's not worth it.

1174
01:10:18,412 --> 01:10:20,380
What's not worth it?

1175
01:10:20,447 --> 01:10:23,851
It was my last attempt
to make the boy a vampire, so you'd stay.

1176
01:10:23,917 --> 01:10:26,887
By ruining his favorite thing?
How could you do that?

1177
01:10:26,954 --> 01:10:28,021
We were desperate.

1178
01:10:28,088 --> 01:10:29,957
You were in on this?

1179
01:10:30,023 --> 01:10:31,458
Dennis won't be
happy in my town.

1180
01:10:31,525 --> 01:10:33,293
Dennis hasn't been there.

1181
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:35,629
Now husband and wife

1182
01:10:35,696 --> 01:10:37,731
Feel the strain
and the strife

1183
01:10:37,798 --> 01:10:39,500
Shut up!

1184
01:10:39,566 --> 01:10:41,768
Johnny,
Dennis is not a monster.

1185
01:10:43,203 --> 01:10:45,339
He likes avocado.

1186
01:10:45,405 --> 01:10:46,907
'Cause you don't let
him eat anything fun.

1187
01:10:46,974 --> 01:10:49,142
I think Dennis just
wants to be normal.

1188
01:10:49,209 --> 01:10:51,545
Can we stop using
the word "normal"?

1189
01:10:51,612 --> 01:10:53,881
Where we live now,
he's normal.

1190
01:10:53,947 --> 01:10:57,718
He is who he is.
And you can't change him, Dad.

1191
01:11:00,687 --> 01:11:02,127
Dennis, where are you going?

1192
01:11:02,189 --> 01:11:03,524
Away.

1193
01:11:05,325 --> 01:11:07,694
But it's not safe
out here by yourself.

1194
01:11:07,761 --> 01:11:10,731
I know a place where
we can hide. Follow me.

1195
01:11:17,170 --> 01:11:18,639
If you didn't stop me,

1196
01:11:18,705 --> 01:11:21,808
my great grandson wouldn't
have to be a wimp his whole life

1197
01:11:21,875 --> 01:11:23,477
like Schlumpy over here.

1198
01:11:23,544 --> 01:11:25,412
A wimp?
Johnny, be cool.

1199
01:11:25,479 --> 01:11:27,548
You wanna throw down, old man?

1200
01:11:27,614 --> 01:11:29,249
Certified yellow
belt since 1997.

1201
01:11:29,316 --> 01:11:31,485
No!

1202
01:11:31,552 --> 01:11:33,654
What's this now?
You're not a vampire?

1203
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:36,223
Bleh?

1204
01:11:36,290 --> 01:11:40,460
Of course he's human. He's our son.
You think we're monsters?

1205
01:11:43,997 --> 01:11:48,802
You! You let your daughter marry a
human and have a human kid?

1206
01:11:48,869 --> 01:11:52,039
Why don't you just
put a stake through my heart.

1207
01:11:52,105 --> 01:11:55,242
We don't hate humans anymore,
and they don't hate us.

1208
01:11:59,012 --> 01:12:00,914
Humans?

1209
01:12:02,349 --> 01:12:03,750
You're a fool.

1210
01:12:03,817 --> 01:12:06,486
Your great grandson is
the sweetest, kindest,

1211
01:12:06,553 --> 01:12:09,323
most special
boy I've ever met.

1212
01:12:09,389 --> 01:12:11,458
And if you can't
give him the love

1213
01:12:11,525 --> 01:12:13,226
he deserves
because he's half human,

1214
01:12:13,293 --> 01:12:14,628
then you're the fool.

1215
01:12:16,163 --> 01:12:17,163
Oh, Daddy.

1216
01:12:19,499 --> 01:12:20,901
Hey, where is Dennis?
Dennis!

1217
01:12:22,169 --> 01:12:23,169
Dennis?

1218
01:12:26,506 --> 01:12:29,476
Happy birthday, Dennis.
I made you a treat.

1219
01:12:29,543 --> 01:12:31,745
Dead pigeon?
Enjoy it.

1220
01:12:31,812 --> 01:12:34,581
'Cause once I graduate business school
and start running a company,

1221
01:12:34,648 --> 01:12:37,517
you're not gonna get
home cooked meals like this anymore.

1222
01:12:37,584 --> 01:12:40,954
I have to move away, Winnie.
To California.

1223
01:12:41,021 --> 01:12:43,790
My mommy thinks
I'm not happy here

1224
01:12:43,857 --> 01:12:46,326
cebause I don't have
hair on my face like you.

1225
01:12:46,393 --> 01:12:48,795
I'm sorry I'm not a monster.

1226
01:12:48,862 --> 01:12:52,232
No, you are perfect.
You're the nicest boy I know.

1227
01:12:52,299 --> 01:12:54,267
And I have 300 brothers.

1228
01:12:54,334 --> 01:12:56,403
You're nice, too, Winnie.

1229
01:13:00,674 --> 01:13:06,013
Well, well, well.
The little human and his pet.

1230
01:13:06,079 --> 01:13:07,881
Dennis!
Denisovich!

1231
01:13:07,948 --> 01:13:09,149
He's not in the room.

1232
01:13:09,216 --> 01:13:10,684
He's not by the pool.

1233
01:13:10,751 --> 01:13:12,386
He's not in this pot of soup.

1234
01:13:12,452 --> 01:13:14,421
Where could he be?

1235
01:13:14,488 --> 01:13:16,657
I don't know why I
ever invited you.

1236
01:13:17,457 --> 01:13:18,992
Dennis!
Dennis!

1237
01:13:19,059 --> 01:13:20,059
Denisovich!

1238
01:13:20,093 --> 01:13:21,093
Dennis!

1239
01:13:33,507 --> 01:13:35,308
Stop squirming.

1240
01:13:35,375 --> 01:13:37,377
Why are you doing this?

1241
01:13:37,444 --> 01:13:39,413
Because this is wrong.

1242
01:13:39,479 --> 01:13:41,815
Why doesn't anybody get that?

1243
01:13:41,882 --> 01:13:44,985
Humans don't
belong with monsters.

1244
01:13:45,052 --> 01:13:46,353
You're wrong!

1245
01:13:46,420 --> 01:13:47,821
I am not!

1246
01:13:47,888 --> 01:13:50,724
I am holding you hostage.

1247
01:13:50,791 --> 01:13:55,962
And me and my crew are gonna
tear that human hugging hotel to shreds.

1248
01:13:56,029 --> 01:13:57,531
You can't.

1249
01:13:57,597 --> 01:13:59,266
Really? Why not?

1250
01:13:59,332 --> 01:14:00,534
Cebause

1251
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:01,735
Cebause, why?

1252
01:14:02,669 --> 01:14:05,839
Cebause it will
make Papa Drac sad.

1253
01:14:05,906 --> 01:14:09,676
Ooh Sad. And what are you
gonna do about it?

1254
01:14:09,743 --> 01:14:11,745
I don't know.

1255
01:14:11,812 --> 01:14:13,780
You know why you don't know?

1256
01:14:13,847 --> 01:14:17,984
Cebause you're just
a weak little boy.

1257
01:14:48,482 --> 01:14:49,983
What was that?

1258
01:14:50,050 --> 01:14:51,618
Dennis, we're coming.

1259
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:54,988
Are you okay, Winnie?

1260
01:14:55,055 --> 01:14:56,423
Yes, my zing.

1261
01:15:32,859 --> 01:15:33,960
Dennis!
There he is, right there.

1262
01:15:34,027 --> 01:15:35,462
Dennis! Baby!

1263
01:15:35,529 --> 01:15:37,063
My big boy!

1264
01:15:37,130 --> 01:15:38,265
Dennis,
we were lookin' for ya.

1265
01:15:38,331 --> 01:15:39,633
Sweetheart.

1266
01:15:39,699 --> 01:15:40,699
I'm so happy to see you.

1267
01:15:44,404 --> 01:15:45,806
There's his mean friends.

1268
01:15:52,579 --> 01:15:54,581
Oh This'll be fun.

1269
01:16:07,594 --> 01:16:08,628
Whoo!

1270
01:16:28,014 --> 01:16:29,015
Huh?

1271
01:16:55,575 --> 01:16:56,943
I didn't do that.

1272
01:17:08,622 --> 01:17:10,123
You rock, Dennis.

1273
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:11,291
He means Denisovich.

1274
01:17:11,358 --> 01:17:12,626
Kakie rules!

1275
01:17:23,370 --> 01:17:24,804
Dennis, I'm coming. Whoa

1276
01:17:30,210 --> 01:17:32,112
I knew all that
practice would pay off.

1277
01:17:56,269 --> 01:17:58,605
That's right,
you better fly away.

1278
01:18:00,173 --> 01:18:03,710
Papa Drac, I'm
a vampire and a superhero.

1279
01:18:03,777 --> 01:18:05,645
Am I cool now?

1280
01:18:05,712 --> 01:18:09,215
"Now"?
Dennis, you were always cool.

1281
01:18:09,282 --> 01:18:13,987
Human, vampire, unicorn,
you're perfect no matter what.

1282
01:18:14,054 --> 01:18:17,357
But since I'm a vampire,
can we stay here?

1283
01:18:18,224 --> 01:18:19,426
Yes.

1284
01:18:19,492 --> 01:18:20,660
All right! Yeah!

1285
01:18:20,727 --> 01:18:21,828
All right!

1286
01:18:24,130 --> 01:18:28,201
But you have to know,
we're going to visit you here every holiday.

1287
01:18:28,268 --> 01:18:30,270
That's fine.
That's fine.

1288
01:18:39,746 --> 01:18:40,747
Aah!

1289
01:18:46,052 --> 01:18:49,990
Don't ever come near
me or my family again.

1290
01:18:53,493 --> 01:18:54,661
No!

1291
01:19:03,837 --> 01:19:07,774
Daddy, you just
saved a human.

1292
01:19:07,841 --> 01:19:10,176
All this pressure about

1293
01:19:10,243 --> 01:19:12,612
when the boy's
fangs were coming out.

1294
01:19:12,679 --> 01:19:15,949
Who cares? Mine came
out years ago! Look.

1295
01:19:18,051 --> 01:19:21,021
Okay, Dad, put 'em back
in before we all barf.

1296
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:24,691
Hey! Isn't it still
somebody's birthday?

1297
01:20:20,847 --> 01:20:22,348
Let me hear you sing!

1298
01:20:24,484 --> 01:20:25,819
I didn't do that.
