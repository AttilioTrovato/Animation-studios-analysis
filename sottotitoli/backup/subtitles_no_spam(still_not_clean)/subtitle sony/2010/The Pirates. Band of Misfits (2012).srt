1
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,470
Admiral Collingwood!

2
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:18,544
Well, Admiral?

3
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:21,080
Great news, Your Majesty!

4
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,048
The French are defeated at last.

5
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:25,784
Also the Russians, the Portuguese,

6
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:26,885
the Chinese

7
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:28,487
and the Welsh.

8
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:31,488
Then our navy rules the ocean.

9
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:36,693
Almost entirely, Your Majesty.

10
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:39,298
"Almost"?

11
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:42,201
Unfortunately, just here,

12
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:45,202
we're still having a little trouble with...

13
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:49,575
...pirates.

14
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:52,576
What does it say on my royal crest, Admiral?

15
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:55,781
"l hate pirates,"

16
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,082
ma'am.

17
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:58,851
Exactly.

18
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:00,119
Hate them.

19
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,120
With their idiotic shanties!

20
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:06,792
And their ridiculous hats!

21
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,793
And their endless, blasted roaring!

22
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:14,397
l want them sunk, Admiral!

23
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:18,168
Scuppered, smashed, fed to the sharks.
Do you hear me?

24
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:21,905
l hate pirates!

25
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:25,110
It's the looting.

26
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:26,812
It's the cutlasses.

27
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,347
It's the looting!

28
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:30,282
It's the cutlasses!

29
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:31,450
Looting!

30
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:33,785
Cutlasses!

31
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:36,786
Looting!

32
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:55,140
Sorry, Captain.

33
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:58,141
We were just discussing
what's the best bit about being a pirate.

34
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,947
You were, were you?

35
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:04,917
l suggested it might be the looting.

36
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:07,753
Whereas l contend it's the shiny cutlasses.

37
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:10,754
And l thought
it was the chance to catch exotic diseases.

38
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:15,827
Well, you're, all of you, wrong.

39
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:18,828
The best bit about being a pirate

40
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:21,800
isn't the looting or the cutlasses.

41
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:24,636
It's not the grog or the scurvy.

42
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:27,506
Or the scantily clad mermaids.

43
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:30,507
The best bit about being a pirate

44
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:35,145
is Ham Night!

45
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:39,382
Ham Night!

46
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:43,386
Ham Night!

47
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:49,993
Ham!

48
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:02,205
On your nose.

49
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:05,575
Go, Captain. Go, Captain.

50
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:09,145
Hey! Hey!

51
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:15,787
It's like a meat ballet.

52
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:17,256
-To Ham Night!
-Ham!

53
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,524
-And to the Pirate Captain!
-Pirate Captain!

54
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:22,525
Pirate Captain!

55
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:25,030
How was that, Number Two?

56
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:27,599
You've still got it, Captain.

57
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,600
I'd take a jellyfish in the face for that man.

58
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,971
Okay, now, shush, shush, shush.
Settle down, lads. Shush.

59
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:34,506
-Lads, lads.
-Pirates!

60
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:35,874
-It's not all about me.
-Don't be modest.

61
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,009
No, no, no.

62
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,111
Behind every captain with glittering eyes

63
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,246
-and a luxuriant beard...
-Luxuriant!

64
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:42,714
That's what it is.

65
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:45,017
...there's a crew of briny rogues.

66
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:46,418
Briny rogues!

67
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:49,054
Sure, some of you
are as ugly as a sea cucumber.

68
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:50,422
Will you get away with ya?

69
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:53,423
Some of you are closer
to being a chair or coat rack than a pirate.

70
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:57,394
And some of you
are just fish I've dressed up in a hat.

71
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:01,331
But you're still the best crew
a captain could wish for.

72
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:04,670
Don't forget Polly.

73
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:07,671
And not forgetting, never forgetting...

74
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:11,207
...Polly. The finest parrot
to sail the seven seas.

75
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:13,078
Come on, girl.

76
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:15,614
l love her beady eyes.

77
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:18,150
Who's the feathery
heart and soul of our boat?

78
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,951
ls it you? ls it you?

79
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:22,120
Yes, it is. Yes, it is.

80
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:23,822
It's definitely you, isn't it?

81
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,823
Yes, it is. Yes, it is.

82
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,531
Right. Where was l?

83
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:33,999
Ah, yes! Ah, yes.

84
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,401
Important announcement.

85
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:39,402
By order of the Pirate King himself...

86
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,847
The Pirate of the Year Awards?

87
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,148
Are you going to...

88
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:51,817
Are you going to enter again?

89
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:54,753
That l am, Surprisingly Curvaceous Pirate.

90
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:57,656
l know it hasn't
worked out perfectly for the last...

91
00:05:57,657 --> 00:05:59,257
-20 year.
-20 years, yeah.

92
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:01,793
Exactly, Pirate with Gout. 20 years.

93
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:04,663
It might be a bit more. 21, 22...

94
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:05,964
Yes, yes. Thank you, thank you.

95
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:07,566
-You were very good, though.
-Shush!

96
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:10,567
The point is,
every time I've entered, I've failed to win.

97
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:13,703
So by the sheer law of maths...

98
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:15,140
Maths.

99
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:18,141
...l must have a really good chance this time.

100
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:19,778
Are you with me, lads?

101
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:22,447
Yes! This can only end brilliantly.

102
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:25,448
Then let's go plundering!

103
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:38,089
Land ho!

104
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,358
Blood Island.

105
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:43,359
So-called because
it's the exact shape of some blood.

106
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:18,394
Yeah!

107
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:36,681
Captain coming through.

108
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,116
Captain coming through.

109
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:39,351
Thank you very much.

110
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,519
Thank you.

111
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,321
One Pirate of the Year
entry form, if you please.

112
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:46,322
Thank you.

113
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,759
Now, let's see.

114
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,860
"Booty"?

115
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,161
Oh, yes.

116
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:52,163
"Roaring." Check.

117
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:53,365
"Shanties."

118
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,200
l shall put "rousing."

119
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,368
"Beard"?

120
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,569
Luxuriant.

121
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,738
Obviously.

122
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:01,239
Do you think l should sign it in blood?

123
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,674
Make it more dramatic?

124
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:05,043
Might be a bit on the showy side.

125
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,045
Bit too much. You might be right.

126
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:10,046
Pirate Captain.

127
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:12,317
You can't lose, Captain.

128
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:14,419
I'd bet my face.

129
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,887
Well, thank you, Albino Pirate.

130
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,188
You're a shoo-in, sir.

131
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:20,189
Sure, there's not a pirate
on the seven seas can match you.

132
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:28,498
Lock up your daughters!

133
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:33,036
It's me, Peg-Leg Hastings!

134
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:35,674
Back from plunderin' the Spanish Main.

135
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:37,008
Good grief.

136
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:40,009
And l reckon this will make me
Pirate of the Year.

137
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:48,551
Don't worry, sir. He's all flash and no bang.

138
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,233
Cutlass Liz.

139
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:04,502
The Butcher of Barbados.

140
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:07,503
Hello, boys.

141
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:11,341
You're probably all wondering
if I'm still as deadly as l am beautiful.

142
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:18,448
Well, l am.

143
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,751
Hello, Cutlass, you trollop.

144
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:24,689
Peg-Leg, you pile of squid bait.

145
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,658
Check it out, lubbers.

146
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:29,659
The world's biggest diamond.

147
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:33,096
That baby's got my name on it.

148
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:38,601
She doesn't even have a beard.

149
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,843
Sweet Neptune's briny pants.

150
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:24,247
Black Bellamy.

151
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:30,321
Roar!

152
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:33,322
Read it and weep, ya coves!

153
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:36,993
That's right,
Black Bellamy is gonna be Pirate of the Year.

154
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,031
Again.

155
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,499
How are you? Good to see you.

156
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,201
Grog for everybody!

157
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:46,202
Grog for everybody!

158
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:50,173
Wow, we are rubbish
compared to them, aren't we?

159
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:13,998
Perhaps we should be off, sir.

160
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:15,433
Yes.

161
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:18,434
Yes, yes, good point.

162
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:21,437
l just remembered, actually,
l have some very important

163
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,540
bits of rope l need to untangle.

164
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:32,615
Thank you.

165
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:38,287
Well, if it isn't the Pirate Captain.

166
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:44,462
Hello, Bellamy. Cutlass. Peg-Leg.

167
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:47,065
Didn't notice you come in.

168
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:49,267
The beard's looking great, my man.

169
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:52,268
And l see that you're more wanted than ever.

170
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,008
Come on, everybody, be nice.
Give him a break.

171
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:59,344
Bring it down a little bit. All right.

172
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:00,645
Seriously, Captain,

173
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:02,514
how's the pirating business treating you?

174
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:05,316
Yeah, yeah, brilliantly, brilliantly.
Thanks for asking.

175
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:07,218
Treasure coming out of my eyeballs.

176
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:09,854
Taken to washing my hair in 50-pound notes.

177
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:11,022
Really?

178
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:13,224
If you've got so much booty,

179
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:16,225
then how come
you're still sailing that old wreck?

180
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:22,131
Anyway, look,
I'd love to stay and chat, but, you know,

181
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:25,535
places to pillage, people to...
People to skewer.

182
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,844
Come on!

183
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:35,845
That is disgusting.

184
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,349
Wait a minute.

185
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:41,119
Captain, what is this?

186
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,720
-What?
-Captain?

187
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:44,823
That's nothing.
Could l possibly have that back?

188
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,291
-Hold on, hold on. Wait, wait.
-Thank you.

189
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:48,059
"Pirate of the Year"?

190
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,895
You're entering Pirate of the Year?

191
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:53,896
No, no, no, no, no.

192
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:57,368
-Yes.
-Again?

193
00:13:57,369 --> 00:14:00,205
Yes!

194
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:02,774
Come on. Listen, did they change the rules?

195
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:05,775
l mean, l always thought they gave it
to the pirate with the most booty.

196
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,480
Do they now just give it to the guy
with the fattest parrot?

197
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:12,383
She is not fat. She's just big-boned.

198
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:14,285
She's fat, dude.

199
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:15,787
Yeah, go on. Go on, then, laugh.

200
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:18,788
Everyone laugh.

201
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:27,029
Ignore them, Captain. It's not worth it.

202
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:30,066
The trophy would just clash
with your wallpaper, anyway.

203
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:39,978
You'll see, you'll see.

204
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:42,680
l will be Pirate of the Year.

205
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:45,681
Yes.

206
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:48,784
And then you'll be laughing on
the other side of your faces.

207
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:52,657
Yes.

208
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:55,658
And believe me, that is
a very painful thing to do.

209
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,562
Come on, lads.

210
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:08,204
Well...

211
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:11,743
All right, now listen up, you coves.

212
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,611
All right, now listen up, you coves.

213
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:16,612
We'll show those swabs
a thing or two about pirating.

214
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:20,116
There's still time
to fill these chests with sparkling booty.

215
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:25,056
l can practically taste that trophy!

216
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:28,057
Trophy! Trophy! Trophy!

217
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:35,898
Captain! Sail off the port bow!

218
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:37,268
Let's get after her, Number Two.

219
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,836
Aye, aye, sir.

220
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:40,238
Clap on all sail!

221
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:42,607
Royals and topgallants!

222
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,608
Release those gallants!

223
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:08,800
Fire those long things that go bang.

224
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,801
Fire cannons four and six!

225
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:22,011
Eat cannonball, lubbers.

226
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:28,284
Here we go, lads! Look and learn.

227
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:33,524
Go get 'em, Pirate Captain!

228
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:36,525
Avast! I'm the Pirate Captain.

229
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:39,230
And I'm here for your gold.

230
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:42,231
Gold? This is a plague boat, old man.
I'd give my right arm for some gold.

231
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,071
Or my left.

232
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:48,139
Right, lads.

233
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,841
Minor hiccup, that last one.

234
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,009
This time,

235
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,010
it's payday!

236
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:58,147
I'm the Pirate Captain,
and I'm here for your gold.

237
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:02,551
Geography field trip.

238
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,624
I'm the Pirate Captain, and...

239
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:09,093
Naturists.

240
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:12,094
Pirate Captain. Blah, blah, blah, blah, gold.

241
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:15,664
Ghost ship.

242
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:23,472
Sorry.

243
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:05,648
Captain, we've sighted another ship, sir.

244
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:11,754
That's nice.

245
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:17,061
Do you want to give the order to attack?

246
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:19,997
No, not really, Number Two. No, l think I've...

247
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:22,667
Think l had enough of piracy.

248
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:24,535
I'm hanging up my cutlass.

249
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:26,370
Captain, no!

250
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:29,240
Yeah, l was thinking
l might go into baby clothes, actually.

251
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:30,374
What?

252
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:33,375
l hear there's a fortune to be made
in baby clothes because

253
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,113
babies grow so fast.

254
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,748
No, but you can't. l mean, the crew...

255
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:39,517
They'd... They'd be lost without you.

256
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:41,586
What was l thinking, Number Two?

257
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:43,321
Pirate of the Year?

258
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:44,522
Me?

259
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:47,523
Look at the trophy cabinet.

260
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:50,593
Best Anecdote About a Squid.

261
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:55,898
l mean, that is all I've got to show
for my entire career.

262
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:57,735
Pirate of the Year?

263
00:18:57,736 --> 00:19:00,438
It's just commercialized nonsense.

264
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:03,107
Real piracy isn't about trophies.

265
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:06,108
It's about fighting up staircases backwards.

266
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:10,081
It's about sliding down sails
with a knife in your teeth.

267
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:12,150
Beard glossiness!

268
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,886
And think about
all the adventures we've had.

269
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:17,455
Our adventure with Aztecs.

270
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:19,390
Our adventure with that pig.

271
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:22,391
Our adventure with...

272
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,831
Okay, maybe not the librarians.
But the fun we've had.

273
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:31,569
And what about the shanties?

274
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:34,238
Well, l mean...
People would miss my shanties.

275
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:36,440
And the running people through.

276
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:39,410
Well, l... l do enjoy running people through.

277
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:41,145
Enjoy it? You're brilliant at it!

278
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:44,146
You're a brine-soaked terror of the high seas!

279
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:46,851
Do you think so, Number Two?

280
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,719
Everyone does!

281
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,720
You're more of a pirate
than Black Bellamy or any of them.

282
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:53,925
You're a real pirate.

283
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:55,593
That's why the crew,

284
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:58,594
they think you're the best thing
since boil-in-the-bag ham.

285
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:01,265
Why do you think they all

286
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:04,101
got that tattoo? Come on.

287
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:05,970
What do you say?

288
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:07,838
Arrr!

289
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:10,839
By Neptune, where's that ship?

290
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,245
This is the one, lads!

291
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:17,246
Ninth time lucky! l can feel it in my beard!

292
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:19,817
Well, don't just sit there like lemons!

293
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:21,185
Hoist the flag!

294
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:22,553
Standard, sir?

295
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,822
Or extra gruesome?

296
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:26,357
Extra gruesome!

297
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:29,358
Let's make their gizzards shake.

298
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:42,506
Journal of Charles Darwin.

299
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:45,507
Day 93 aboard the Beagle.

300
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:49,878
I have, today,
discovered a new kind of barnacle,

301
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:54,717
Which I have categorized
in the order of Pygophora.

302
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:04,293
I.ll never get a girlfriend. I am so unhappy.

303
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:22,044
And now I.m being attacked by pirates.

304
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:40,229
Avast! I'm the Pirate Captain,
and I'm here for your gold.

305
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:44,335
l haven't got any gold.

306
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:45,936
No gold, eh?

307
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:48,906
Then what, might l ask, is this?

308
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:51,008
It's a baboon's kidney.

309
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:53,010
ls it?

310
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:55,413
And what about this?

311
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:58,414
It's another baboon's kidney.

312
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:01,519
We searched the hold, Captain.

313
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,154
And?

314
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,689
Just creatures.

315
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:07,690
Bits of creatures in jars.

316
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:10,693
And an unhappy-looking baboon.

317
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:16,167
What kind of ship is this?

318
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,635
We're a...

319
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:20,636
Well, we were a scientific expedition.

320
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:23,708
Charles Darwin, at your service, sir.

321
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:26,709
For pity's sake!

322
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:29,812
ls it so much to ask? ls it?

323
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:33,284
l just want one tiny bit of success!

324
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:36,285
One teensy weensy bit
of respect from my peers

325
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:39,824
just once in my life!

326
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:41,292
ls that such a crime?

327
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:44,293
ls it?

328
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:47,465
-No?
-No!

329
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:48,566
No.

330
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:50,668
But you try telling that to the universe.

331
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:53,669
Just once, just once for things to go right.

332
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:56,739
Just... Just once.

333
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:01,910
So, are we done here?

334
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,686
Dear Diary,

335
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:10,888
about to meet a watery grave.

336
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,957
It's nothing personal, you understand.

337
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:15,192
It's just... It's been a tough week,

338
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:18,193
and a good plank walk
usually cheers him up.

339
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:21,330
Will die without reaching second base
with a lady.

340
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:25,267
Get on with it!

341
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:28,773
Today's weather:

342
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:31,774
inclement.

343
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:39,049
-Stop!
-Now what?

344
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,452
Last request, is it?
Do we have to grant those?

345
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:44,453
ls there some sort of
human rights convention we're signed up to?

346
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:46,490
-But that bird!
-My parrot?

347
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:47,925
She's just big-boned!

348
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,926
No, she's not.
l mean... l mean, she's not a parrot.

349
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,363
Not a parrot?

350
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:53,831
What's he on about, old girl?

351
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:55,065
She's... She's...

352
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:57,968
She's the scientific discovery of our age!

353
00:23:57,969 --> 00:24:00,969
She's a...

354
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:04,608
Sorry. It's just,

355
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:07,609
that's my favorite bit.

356
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:13,884
A dodo, you say?

357
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:16,720
They've been extinct for 150 years.

358
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:19,721
To find one alive today, it's quite incredible.

359
00:24:20,058 --> 00:24:23,058
Well, clever old girl. Not going extinct.

360
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:26,161
If l might be so bold, l would be prepared

361
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:29,731
to pay you 10 pounds for your Polly.

362
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:32,036
Polly's not for sale.

363
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:33,571
Ten pound.

364
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:34,839
She's one of the family.

365
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,574
She's like an auntie.

366
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:37,875
With a beak.

367
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:39,176
Yeah, I'm afraid they're right, Charles.

368
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:42,079
Polly here is the feathery
heart and soul of the boat.

369
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,080
Come on, little dodo.

370
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:49,587
It's such a missed opportunity.

371
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:51,288
If l could've presented her

372
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:54,289
in London to the Royal Society
at their annual science show...

373
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,894
No question of that, I'm afraid.

374
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:59,430
-She'd have been an absolute sensation.
-Yeah, well, can't be helped.

375
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:02,431
And of course a shoo-in for the top prize.

376
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:05,536
Prize?

377
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:08,537
For best scientific discovery. Yes.

378
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:12,643
This prize,

379
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:15,644
-valuable, is it?
-Valuable?

380
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:18,549
It's priceless.

381
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:21,550
Untold riches.

382
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:25,923
-Captain...
-No, no, no, no.

383
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:28,726
l was thinking, perhaps,
perhaps l was being a touch hasty.

384
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:29,894
But, Captain, London?

385
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:31,595
The home of Queen Victoria,

386
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:33,631
mortal enemy of pirates everywhere?

387
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:36,632
We'll end up hanged at Execution Dock.

388
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:40,871
We laugh in the face of danger, remember?

389
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:43,872
-l don't.
-l don't really like danger at all.

390
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:47,943
Captain, do you remember
the little talk we had?

391
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:51,547
The one about whether pigs
are actually a type of fruit?

392
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:55,817
No.

393
00:25:57,822 --> 00:25:58,923
No.

394
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:01,392
The one about us trying
to avoid harebrained schemes

395
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:02,993
that end in us facing certain death.

396
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:04,929
You heard the man, Number Two.

397
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,830
"Untold riches."

398
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:08,065
Here's the plan.

399
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:11,066
We go to London,
Polly wins this science show thingy,

400
00:26:11,636 --> 00:26:14,636
we take the prize money,
l enter Pirate of the Year, l win!

401
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:17,174
Bingo!

402
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:19,243
-But, Captain, I'm not sure...
-It can't fail.

403
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:22,244
And besides, look at her little face.

404
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:25,816
l sure want to win that science prize.

405
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:27,017
Squawk!

406
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:28,752
Bravo, Captain!

407
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:31,753
l see you're a man of vision!

408
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:36,627
Right, then, Charles.
When is this science show of yours?

409
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:38,395
A week tomorrow.

410
00:26:38,396 --> 00:26:39,930
Confound it!

411
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,865
You see, we could've
made that with a good wind behind us,

412
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:44,866
but unfortunately there's this dirty
great sea monster in the way.

413
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:50,038
l think they just add those onto maps
for decoration, Captain.

414
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:56,146
ls that a fact?

415
00:26:56,147 --> 00:26:58,882
Well, blow me down.

416
00:26:58,883 --> 00:27:01,883
l dare, you could learn something
from this fine fellow, Number Two.

417
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:48,332
London Town.

418
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:51,333
The most romantic city in the world.

419
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:09,153
"Queen Victoria

420
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:12,154
"welcomes you to London."

421
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:13,857
That's nice.

422
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:16,858
Perhaps she's not so bad after all.

423
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:24,001
Well, don't look so worried, Number Two.

424
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:27,002
Pirates are always visiting London.

425
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:30,407
Turn back!

426
00:28:30,408 --> 00:28:33,408
This is the fate of pirates here!

427
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:36,380
ls that Scarlett Morgan?

428
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,148
Pirate Captain.

429
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:39,616
Goodness me!

430
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:42,617
l haven't seen you
since that business in Madagascar.

431
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:47,458
Yes. l could've sworn they were girls.

432
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:49,059
You're looking well, Morgan.

433
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,527
Yeah, lost a bit of weight.

434
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:52,129
What are you up to these days?

435
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,263
You know, this and that.

436
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:56,233
Yeah, just gonna enter
a science competition, actually.

437
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:59,234
-Good luck with that.
-Yeah, thanks, thanks.

438
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:02,873
No, no, wait, wait!

439
00:29:02,874 --> 00:29:04,141
Turn back!

440
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:07,142
Turn back.

441
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:12,116
-Sorry.
-No!

442
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:14,351
Look what you've done to me boat.
Look at the state of it.

443
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:17,352
l hope you've got some insurance, 'cause l...

444
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:18,922
Right, then. We'll be off.

445
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,691
I'll bring her back tomorrow
straight after the show.

446
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:23,393
Well, don't be daft, Charles.
I'll be presenting Polly.

447
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:24,695
-You?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

448
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:27,464
l always fancied
trying my hand at a spot of science.

449
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:28,799
But you can't. l mean,

450
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,468
the streets of London
are no place for pirates.

451
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:34,371
Pirates? What pirates?

452
00:29:34,372 --> 00:29:35,572
Nobody here but us Girl Guides.

453
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:38,041
Yes!

454
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:39,810
I've got a badge for looting.

455
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:42,811
We're not really Girl Guides.
It's us, the pirates.

456
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:44,748
We're masters of disguise.

457
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:46,984
How ingenious.

458
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:49,985
But all the same, Captain,
best we lie low for the night.

459
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:51,789
Perhaps at my house.

460
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,957
-Captain, l really think...
-Good plan, Chuck.

461
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,958
Be fun to see how you boffin types live.

462
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:02,297
Well, come on. Taxi!

463
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:05,202
Evening, Officer.

464
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:08,203
Hidey-ho, ladies.

465
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:15,777
London smells like Grandma.

466
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,021
Whoa.

467
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:26,123
Here we are.

468
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:29,124
Home, sweet home.

469
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:35,397
You don't get many women back here,
do you, Charles?

470
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:38,934
People who live alone
are always serial killers.

471
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:49,413
Sweet Neptune on a bike!

472
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:50,914
Don't mind Mr. Bobo.

473
00:30:50,915 --> 00:30:53,550
-Just an old project of mine.
-Project?

474
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:54,952
Yeah, l had this theory.

475
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:57,821
l thought that if you took a monkey,
gave him a monocle

476
00:30:57,822 --> 00:31:00,390
and covered up his gigantic, unsightly ass,

477
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:03,327
then he would cease
to be a monkey and become more of a...

478
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:05,662
A man-panzee, if you will.

479
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:06,763
Bold theory.

480
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:09,399
l don't like the monkey.

481
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,702
But to be honest, monkeys are 10 a penny.

482
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:14,703
He's not a patch on Polly here.

483
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:17,007
Anyhow, big day tomorrow.

484
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:18,208
We all need our rest.

485
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:21,209
Let me show you to your room, Captain.

486
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,480
Right behind you, Chuck.

487
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,627
Now, here's the plan.

488
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:39,628
You know what to do.
Wait until the bearded idiot is asleep,

489
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:43,431
then sneak into his room and...

490
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:57,781
Captain.

491
00:31:57,782 --> 00:32:00,782
It's... It's Mr. Darwin, sir.
I'm sure he's up to no good.

492
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:02,886
Honestly, Number Two, what's got into you?

493
00:32:02,887 --> 00:32:05,887
Thanks to Charles,
we're about to win lavish untold riches,

494
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:08,759
and here you are
trying to find fault with the poor fellow.

495
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,661
-Yes, but...
-No, no, no. Not another word.

496
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:13,662
A future Pirate of the Year
needs his beauty sleep.

497
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:17,332
Do you think you could
make nautical noises until we drop off?

498
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,609
That's lovely. Now, that is lovely.
Can you do the shiver a timber?

499
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:36,885
And just chuck in a few gulls, would you?

500
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:11,655
Ladies and gentlemen, our Winner.

501
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:14,656
Give it up for the Pirate Captain!

502
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:34,542
Congratulations, Pirate Captain.

503
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:38,346
Nobody deserves this more than you.

504
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:40,417
Thanks, Cutlass.

505
00:33:40,418 --> 00:33:43,418
And that beard of yours,

506
00:33:44,655 --> 00:33:46,223
it drives me

507
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:49,224
crazy.

508
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,732
Give it here.

509
00:33:55,733 --> 00:33:57,768
Give it back, Bellamy, it's mine!

510
00:33:57,769 --> 00:34:00,769
No, give it back.

511
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:04,975
Neptune's navel!

512
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:06,109
Come back here, you lubber.

513
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:09,110
Stop, thief!

514
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:23,927
I'll take that.

515
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:26,928
Not so fast, my friend.

516
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:29,866
Number Two!

517
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:32,867
Number Two, are you all right?

518
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:36,838
Unhand that dodo!

519
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:48,216
Evening, Captain.

520
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:12,107
Number Two!

521
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:20,250
We're under attack!

522
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:23,251
Abandon ship!

523
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:28,990
Hello, Pirate Captain, Pirate with a Scarf!

524
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:44,105
Come back here,
Mysterious Shadowy Figure!

525
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:50,812
Faster! Faster!

526
00:36:17,141 --> 00:36:19,609
Got you! Are you all right, girl?

527
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:22,479
Captain! l mean, what's going on?

528
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,447
Don't play the innocent.

529
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:27,448
You and your hench-monkey
tried to steal Polly.

530
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:31,052
Steal Polly? Dear me, no, you're mistaken.

531
00:36:31,155 --> 00:36:34,155
Then how do you explain this?

532
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:45,202
Well, l think it's obvious
what's happened, isn't it?

533
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,336
ls it?

534
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:48,605
Some jealous rival scientist

535
00:36:48,606 --> 00:36:51,606
must have tried to make off with the dodo.

536
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:54,709
Well, that explains everything.

537
00:36:54,845 --> 00:36:57,047
Captain, please, let's go.

538
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,481
Polly's not safe in London.

539
00:36:58,482 --> 00:37:00,750
l couldn't bear it
if something happened to Polly.

540
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:03,286
Nothing is going to happen to Polly.

541
00:37:03,287 --> 00:37:06,287
She'll be perfectly safe.
Leave everything to me.

542
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:09,357
Now, come on,
we can't keep that prize waiting.

543
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:36,786
Nice going, banana butt.

544
00:37:36,787 --> 00:37:39,556
Now this briny buffoon
is gonna grab all the glory.

545
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:41,024
It's a disaster.

546
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:43,927
It's...

547
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,363
Bad news, I'm afraid, Captain.

548
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:48,798
You can't go in.

549
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:51,799
It's strictly scientists only, you see.

550
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:55,203
I'll just have to present Polly

551
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:56,473
myself.

552
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:59,242
We're not really scientists.
It's us, the pirates.

553
00:37:59,243 --> 00:38:02,243
See? Masters of disguise.

554
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,747
But where's Polly?

555
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:06,616
That is on a need-to-know basis
from here on in, Charles.

556
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,418
-Pardon?
-l am keeping her hidden.

557
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:11,419
That shadowy figure could be anywhere.

558
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:14,057
Luckily, l am not only a master of disguises,

559
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:17,058
l am also a master of hiding things.

560
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:19,262
Right, lads,
let's show these boffins what's what.

561
00:38:19,263 --> 00:38:20,964
But, Captain.

562
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,867
-Really, l...
-Hello!

563
00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:25,869
We're here for the science show.

564
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,704
We're scientists.

565
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:30,173
That's a pipette, this is Charles Darwin,

566
00:38:30,174 --> 00:38:32,275
and l am the Scientist Captain.

567
00:38:32,276 --> 00:38:35,276
If you're a scientist, name three elements.

568
00:38:36,013 --> 00:38:37,213
Well, let's see now.

569
00:38:37,214 --> 00:38:40,214
There's... There's gold, ham...

570
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:44,020
...and

571
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:46,489
the tears of a mermaid.

572
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:49,490
Yeah, two out of three. Close enough.
First on your left.

573
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:52,529
The balloon of my airship contains

574
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,631
-20,000 cubic feet of hydrogen gas.
-Excuse me.

575
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:56,099
Sorry.

576
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,935
Just here, you will notice the open log fire

577
00:38:58,936 --> 00:39:01,936
to ensure a comfortable
temperature at higher altitudes.

578
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:04,674
Captain?

579
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,376
Captain, Captain, please.

580
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:08,311
You can't possibly
appear on stage without Polly.

581
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:11,312
Patience, Charles. All in good time.

582
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:13,983
Excuse me. Sorry.

583
00:39:13,984 --> 00:39:16,984
-Sorry.
-Idiot!

584
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:21,255
-Just a tick.
-But, Captain...

585
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,097
How on earth did...

586
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:30,098
My airship will revolutionize
the fields of meteorology and cartography.

587
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:35,572
But mostly,

588
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:38,475
it's for looking down ladies' tops.

589
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:41,476
Ingenious.

590
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:47,784
Captain, l really, really think

591
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:50,253
it would be best if l take over from here.

592
00:39:50,254 --> 00:39:52,188
There's a certain manner
in which these things are conduc...

593
00:39:52,189 --> 00:39:53,256
Nonsense, Chuck.

594
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:56,257
What this science stuff needs
is a bit of showmanship!

595
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:14,377
Look, it's the captain.

596
00:40:14,378 --> 00:40:17,378
Captain! Captain!

597
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:20,982
Fellow scientists, poindexters, geeks,

598
00:40:22,853 --> 00:40:25,588
prepare to be confounded.

599
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,657
Prepare to be amazed.

600
00:40:27,658 --> 00:40:29,759
Prepare to...

601
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,760
Wait a second. What's this?

602
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,100
What's this?

603
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:44,140
Stop!

604
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:46,943
l am the world's leading doctor,

605
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:49,944
and l declare the science you are doing
is too shocking by half.

606
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:52,549
Dr. Albino,

607
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:55,251
are you saying that those of a nervous
disposition should leave immediately,

608
00:40:55,252 --> 00:40:58,252
in case the sheer unexpected
remarkableness of my discovery

609
00:40:58,322 --> 00:41:01,322
should cause their hearts to explode?

610
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:05,395
l am.

611
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:08,396
Well, science lovers, you have been warned.

612
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:11,799
This is our most educational adventure ever.

613
00:41:17,942 --> 00:41:20,343
Back from the dead.

614
00:41:20,344 --> 00:41:23,344
Back from beyond the grave.

615
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:26,414
Back to astound you all.

616
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,351
The ninth wonder of the world.

617
00:41:28,352 --> 00:41:31,352
She's traveled halfway
across the globe to be here tonight.

618
00:41:32,122 --> 00:41:35,122
Here's Polly!

619
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:40,528
It's a dodo.

620
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:44,665
By Jove.

621
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:48,870
That is astounding!

622
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:56,613
An actual dodo!

623
00:41:56,614 --> 00:41:59,614
Makes electricity look like a pile of crap.

624
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:09,459
The Royal Society's prize

625
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:12,460
for best scientific discovery...

626
00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:14,230
l hope it's not a check.

627
00:42:14,231 --> 00:42:16,332
...is awarded to...

628
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:17,834
Have you any idea
what the sterling-doubloon

629
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:19,035
exchange rate is these days?

630
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:21,571
...the Scientist Captain.

631
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:23,239
Thank you, thank you.

632
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,474
You're too kind.

633
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:26,209
Please stop. Enough. Thank you.

634
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:29,210
Thank you.

635
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,150
ls that it?

636
00:42:34,151 --> 00:42:35,318
Oh, no.

637
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:37,520
-Good.
-You also get

638
00:42:37,521 --> 00:42:40,521
this leather-bound set of encyclopedias.

639
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:46,627
Excuse me just one moment. Thank you.

640
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:47,964
Okay, Chuck.

641
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:50,567
Now, l like encyclopedias
as much as the next man,

642
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:53,568
but they're not exactly gonna help me win
Pirate of the Year, are they?

643
00:42:55,372 --> 00:42:56,439
Where's the booty?

644
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,308
Booty? What booty?

645
00:42:58,309 --> 00:43:01,309
The prize! The "untold riches," remember?

646
00:43:03,514 --> 00:43:05,515
Perhaps l didn't explain.

647
00:43:05,516 --> 00:43:07,550
It's not all about money.

648
00:43:07,551 --> 00:43:09,819
No, the real prize is...

649
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:12,322
Her Royal Majesty, the Empress of India,

650
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:14,591
Ruler of the Kingdom of Java...

651
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,960
-...a personal audience with...
-...Defender of the Faith,

652
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:19,195
-Queen Victoria!
-Queen Victoria

653
00:43:19,196 --> 00:43:22,196
herself.

654
00:43:47,224 --> 00:43:49,192
Scientist Captain,

655
00:43:49,193 --> 00:43:51,027
congratulations.

656
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:52,362
What a tremendous discovery.

657
00:43:52,363 --> 00:43:54,731
Your... Your Majesty.

658
00:43:54,732 --> 00:43:57,732
And who are these charming fellows?

659
00:43:57,901 --> 00:44:00,901
-Well, this is my crew.
-By which he means lab assistant crew.

660
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:04,240
Yes, yes.
I'm using "crew" in the street sense.

661
00:44:04,241 --> 00:44:05,642
Yo.

662
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:08,111
And I'm Charles Darwin, Your Majesty.

663
00:44:08,112 --> 00:44:11,014
l helped find the dodo.

664
00:44:11,015 --> 00:44:12,615
Yes, whatever.

665
00:44:12,616 --> 00:44:15,616
But where has your
delightful creature disappeared to?

666
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,754
Resting, ma'am. Hidden away.

667
00:44:17,755 --> 00:44:20,256
l only let her out
for the big performance, I'm afraid.

668
00:44:20,257 --> 00:44:23,257
In case sinister forces
should try to make off with her, you see.

669
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:24,994
Sinister forces?

670
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:26,429
Dear.

671
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:29,430
Well, we have a wonderful
petting zoo at the palace

672
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:33,136
where Polly would be quite safe.

673
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:35,405
Perhaps we could

674
00:44:35,406 --> 00:44:38,406
take her off your hands.

675
00:44:38,542 --> 00:44:41,044
I'm sorry, ma'am,
but that's out of the question.

676
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:42,512
But she'd have a lovely time.

677
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:45,513
There are guinea pigs and a donkey.

678
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:47,650
No, no, l couldn't, ma'am.

679
00:44:47,651 --> 00:44:50,651
Not even for little old me?

680
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:53,589
No, no, no, I'm afraid not, ma'am.

681
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:55,992
No, you see,
there is nothing more important to a pirate

682
00:44:55,993 --> 00:44:57,627
than his trusted dodo.

683
00:44:57,628 --> 00:45:00,628
She is the feathery
heart and soul of the boat.

684
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:04,899
Did you say...

685
00:45:06,236 --> 00:45:08,871
..."pirate"?

686
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:10,873
Pirate? No, no, no, no, no.

687
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:12,308
Scientist.

688
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:15,044
Yes, good old, good old science.
Can't get enough of it.

689
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:16,379
Mixing stuff together.

690
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,448
You know, test tube tubing
and Bunsen burning.

691
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:21,449
See?

692
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:24,387
He's no scientist!

693
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:27,388
He's a Girl Guide!

694
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:30,593
He's no Girl Guide!

695
00:45:30,594 --> 00:45:33,594
-He's a pirate!
-Pirate!

696
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:36,399
Hang on, hang on.

697
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,901
There's been some kind of mistake. Some...

698
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:40,503
Some silly mistake. Whoa, laddies!

699
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:43,504
Stop, stop. l can explain.

700
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:01,090
Your Majesty.

701
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:02,191
He's hidden the dodo.

702
00:46:02,192 --> 00:46:03,493
If you chop his head off now,

703
00:46:03,494 --> 00:46:05,762
we might never find out where.

704
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:08,763
Wait a mo.

705
00:46:18,408 --> 00:46:20,576
One doesn't know why.

706
00:46:20,577 --> 00:46:23,577
Perhaps it's his luxuriant beard
or his gleaming teeth

707
00:46:24,915 --> 00:46:27,915
or the way he smells faintly of coconuts.

708
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:30,951
But we have taken a shine to this pirate.

709
00:46:31,321 --> 00:46:34,321
Do you have a name, pirate captain?

710
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:37,958
They call me the Pirate Captain.

711
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:40,329
Well, Pirate Captain,

712
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:43,330
we hereby pardon you
of your piratical crimes.

713
00:46:49,072 --> 00:46:51,007
You will stay in London, Pirate Captain,

714
00:46:51,008 --> 00:46:54,008
and entertain us
with your stories and your wit.

715
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:56,679
And especially

716
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:59,680
your dear little dodo.

717
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:06,622
Hell's barnacles.

718
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:08,391
Can we please get out of here now?

719
00:47:08,392 --> 00:47:10,159
That was a bit close for comfort,
Number Two.

720
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,160
l will get you the dodo, Your Majesty.

721
00:47:13,263 --> 00:47:16,263
See that you do, Mr. Darwin.

722
00:47:21,772 --> 00:47:23,573
Captain?

723
00:47:25,876 --> 00:47:26,008
Hurry up, lads, chop-chop.

724
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:27,810
Hurry up, lads, chop-chop.

725
00:47:27,811 --> 00:47:29,278
Let's get back to sea where we belong.

726
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:31,180
Aye, aye, Captain!

727
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:32,682
l told you coming to London was a bad idea.

728
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:34,116
The sooner l get the smell of brine in my...

729
00:47:34,117 --> 00:47:35,818
Captain!

730
00:47:35,819 --> 00:47:37,320
Captain!

731
00:47:37,321 --> 00:47:40,321
Whoa!

732
00:47:40,457 --> 00:47:42,959
You're not leaving, surely?

733
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,393
l most certainly am.

734
00:47:44,394 --> 00:47:46,162
You've let me down badly, Charles.

735
00:47:46,163 --> 00:47:47,730
Look! Look!

736
00:47:47,731 --> 00:47:48,898
-Also, to be frank...
-Captain...

737
00:47:48,899 --> 00:47:51,000
...your nose is too small for your face.

738
00:47:51,001 --> 00:47:54,001
But you're the toast of London Town.

739
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:59,709
l say, look at that.

740
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,310
They've really captured my eyes.

741
00:48:01,311 --> 00:48:04,311
We were hoping
you might come out for a little

742
00:48:04,448 --> 00:48:07,448
celebration before you go.

743
00:48:08,986 --> 00:48:11,954
We don't want to miss the tide, Captain.

744
00:48:11,955 --> 00:48:14,457
-No, no, no. Quite right, quite right.
-Captain,

745
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:17,458
do join us, please?

746
00:48:18,128 --> 00:48:20,963
I'll just stop for a quick one. Rude to refuse.

747
00:48:20,964 --> 00:48:22,531
-But it's Ham Night.
-I'll be 20 minutes.

748
00:48:22,532 --> 00:48:23,699
Half an hour tops.

749
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,668
Just get her...
Get her warmed up without me.

750
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:27,536
Aren't we going yet?

751
00:48:27,537 --> 00:48:29,972
But what about winning the Pirate of the Year

752
00:48:29,973 --> 00:48:32,973
and showing all those other captains
that he's not a loser?

753
00:48:40,717 --> 00:48:43,286
Yoo-hoo! Come along, Captain.

754
00:48:43,287 --> 00:48:45,121
Captain...

755
00:48:45,122 --> 00:48:46,589
-Cheers!
-Good evening.

756
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,324
Thank you. Thank you so very much.

757
00:48:48,325 --> 00:48:49,759
-Captain...
-And your name is?

758
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,760
Miss Jane Austen.

759
00:48:56,967 --> 00:48:59,967
And that, and that is why, in a straight fight,

760
00:49:00,537 --> 00:49:03,537
a shark would probably beat a Dracula.

761
00:49:04,308 --> 00:49:06,909
Jane Austen,
feel free to use it in one of your books.

762
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:09,910
Pirate Captain, you are a born raconteur.

763
00:49:10,547 --> 00:49:13,547
So much better
than the last chap we all went doolally over.

764
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:17,151
You've all been terribly kind.

765
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:20,122
Do run along.

766
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:22,525
Another drink, Captain?

767
00:49:22,526 --> 00:49:25,526
Cheers, Chuck.

768
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:28,230
l say, you're not

769
00:49:28,231 --> 00:49:31,231
-related in some way, are you?
-Pardon?

770
00:49:31,401 --> 00:49:33,169
It's just you, sort of...

771
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:35,438
Well, no, no, nothing, nothing, nothing.

772
00:49:35,439 --> 00:49:38,439
Cheers.

773
00:49:45,782 --> 00:49:48,017
Do you know what I've discovered, Charles?

774
00:49:48,018 --> 00:49:50,753
The friends you make
after you've become famous

775
00:49:50,754 --> 00:49:52,788
are better, truer friends

776
00:49:52,789 --> 00:49:54,924
than the ones you've had
for years beforehand.

777
00:49:54,925 --> 00:49:57,925
So very wise.

778
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:00,730
But the lads will think I'm a fool.

779
00:50:00,731 --> 00:50:03,566
No. A fool, you?

780
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:05,735
You're an intellectual giant.

781
00:50:05,736 --> 00:50:08,437
Just look at how
you managed to keep Polly safe

782
00:50:08,438 --> 00:50:10,239
from those sinister forces.

783
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:11,841
Yes, l did do that, didn't l?

784
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:13,542
You did.

785
00:50:13,543 --> 00:50:15,845
And wherever she's hidden,

786
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,347
l bet it's somewhere really ingenious.

787
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:21,250
It is rather.

788
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:22,752
You'll never guess where.

789
00:50:22,753 --> 00:50:25,753
Well, no, why,
you're too smart for me, Captain.

790
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:28,024
Right under everyone's noses.

791
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:31,025
Or right under my noses, anyhow.

792
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:36,196
Ta-da!

793
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:40,501
You've been keeping Polly in your beard?

794
00:50:41,004 --> 00:50:44,004
Actually, l keep all sorts in here.

795
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:46,942
I'm sorry about this, Captain.

796
00:50:46,943 --> 00:50:49,943
About what?

797
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:53,280
What the...
What's the monkey-man playing at?

798
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:57,051
This patently isn't even a real...

799
00:51:05,629 --> 00:51:08,629
Come back here, you lubbers!

800
00:51:13,503 --> 00:51:16,503
Sorry, Your Reverence.

801
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:34,088
Got you, you rogue!

802
00:51:39,796 --> 00:51:42,796
Yeah, that's rather nice.

803
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:45,701
Neptune's lips, what are you up to?

804
00:51:45,702 --> 00:51:47,136
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. It's not my fault.

805
00:51:47,137 --> 00:51:48,804
What do you mean "not your fault"?

806
00:51:48,805 --> 00:51:51,805
You steal Polly,
you shoot my best hat full of holes.

807
00:52:09,993 --> 00:52:11,527
Well, go on, then.

808
00:52:11,528 --> 00:52:14,363
Explain yourself.

809
00:52:14,364 --> 00:52:15,998
There's this girl.

810
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:18,367
I'm hopelessly smitten with her.

811
00:52:18,368 --> 00:52:20,102
I'm listening.

812
00:52:20,103 --> 00:52:23,103
l know how partial she is to exotic animals,

813
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,876
and l thought if l could get her the dodo,

814
00:52:26,877 --> 00:52:29,877
then she might like me.

815
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:34,583
I'm so ashamed.

816
00:52:34,584 --> 00:52:36,986
Why didn't you say so?

817
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:39,655
We've all done stupid things to impress girls.

818
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:41,257
Yeah, you should act aloof.

819
00:52:41,258 --> 00:52:43,726
They love it when you act aloof.

820
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:45,961
Still, must be quite a girl
for you to go to all that trouble.

821
00:52:45,962 --> 00:52:48,962
She is quite a girl.

822
00:52:49,966 --> 00:52:52,668
Kraken's biscuits!

823
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:55,669
Mr. Darwin.

824
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:58,474
Honestly, Charles.

825
00:52:58,475 --> 00:53:01,475
It's the bun. The bun really does it for me.

826
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:03,913
And l see you've brought a friend.

827
00:53:03,914 --> 00:53:05,047
How delightful.

828
00:53:05,048 --> 00:53:07,249
I'm sorry. l didn't mean to...

829
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:10,250
Oh, get a grip, man. You couldn't
manage one tiny task, could you?

830
00:53:10,487 --> 00:53:13,487
It's pathetic.

831
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:43,383
Listen, Captain, l can see
I've gone about this all wrong.

832
00:53:46,656 --> 00:53:49,656
You see, l might have the body
of a weak and feeble woman,

833
00:53:52,929 --> 00:53:55,929
but l have the heart and soul of a person
who really, really wants that dodo.

834
00:54:18,054 --> 00:54:21,054
l seem to recall that you piratical types
have a bit of a soft spot for shiny things.

835
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:27,594
Or am l getting you
muddled up with magpies?

836
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:29,798
l couldn't.

837
00:54:29,799 --> 00:54:32,735
l mean, Polly, she's a family...

838
00:54:32,736 --> 00:54:35,736
Come now, Captain, it's so simple.

839
00:54:35,805 --> 00:54:38,240
Polly here could live like
a queen at my petting zoo,

840
00:54:38,241 --> 00:54:41,241
and you... well...

841
00:54:42,712 --> 00:54:45,614
With treasure like this,

842
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:48,615
you could be famed across the seven seas.

843
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:55,658
Captain.

844
00:54:55,659 --> 00:54:58,659
Polly's not for sale.

845
00:54:59,996 --> 00:55:02,197
You? Win Pirate of the Year?

846
00:55:02,198 --> 00:55:03,732
You're a shoo-in, sir.

847
00:55:03,733 --> 00:55:06,733
There's not a pirate
on the seven seas can match you.

848
00:55:06,836 --> 00:55:08,904
But what about winning Pirate of the Year

849
00:55:08,905 --> 00:55:11,905
and showing all those other captains
that you're not a loser?

850
00:55:11,941 --> 00:55:14,941
Loser... Loser...

851
00:55:16,713 --> 00:55:19,713
I.m a floating head.

852
00:55:20,383 --> 00:55:22,551
So, Captain,

853
00:55:22,552 --> 00:55:25,552
are you going to do the right thing?

854
00:55:30,226 --> 00:55:33,226
I.m sailing out on the ocean

855
00:55:34,431 --> 00:55:37,431
Out on the deep blue sea

856
00:55:37,567 --> 00:55:40,269
20 minutes, he said.

857
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:42,004
Didn't he say 20 minutes?

858
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:43,339
Don't worry, lads.

859
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:45,908
He probably just got caught up,

860
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:47,109
you know,

861
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:50,110
battling a giant squid or something.

862
00:55:58,822 --> 00:56:00,322
Well, come on, you lubbers!

863
00:56:00,323 --> 00:56:01,557
It's him!

864
00:56:01,558 --> 00:56:02,791
l told you!

865
00:56:02,792 --> 00:56:05,160
l... l told you he wouldn't let us down.

866
00:56:05,161 --> 00:56:07,429
Hello, boys.

867
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:09,064
Miss me?

868
00:56:09,065 --> 00:56:11,200
I'm having a mirage.

869
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:13,802
But... How?

870
00:56:13,803 --> 00:56:15,003
Good question, Number Two.

871
00:56:15,004 --> 00:56:18,004
l stole it all in a daring raid
on the Tower of London.

872
00:56:18,608 --> 00:56:21,608
You stole all this from the Tower of London?

873
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:24,680
That's right.

874
00:56:24,681 --> 00:56:27,015
Then l burnt it to the ground,
wrestled a bear,

875
00:56:27,016 --> 00:56:29,952
and l kissed a princess for good measure.

876
00:56:29,953 --> 00:56:32,921
Well, what are you waiting for?
Don't just stand there like porpoises.

877
00:56:32,922 --> 00:56:35,922
There's a trophy with our names on it!

878
00:56:44,434 --> 00:56:46,535
Avast, me hearties!

879
00:56:46,536 --> 00:56:49,536
And welcome to the
59th Annual Pirate of the Year Awards!

880
00:57:10,293 --> 00:57:12,094
This is the ticket, eh, Number Two?

881
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:14,663
Please, please, please,
can't Polly come out now?

882
00:57:14,664 --> 00:57:17,633
Best not.

883
00:57:17,634 --> 00:57:18,967
She's still very tired.

884
00:57:18,968 --> 00:57:20,869
-And here ls your host for the evening...
-Shush.

885
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:23,870
... The Pirate King!

886
00:57:28,678 --> 00:57:31,678
Hello, Pirates!

887
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:34,249
Hello, Pirate King!

888
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:35,951
Any lubbers in tonight?

889
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:38,952
No!

890
00:57:42,058 --> 00:57:44,893
Behind you!

891
00:57:44,894 --> 00:57:45,961
I'm Queen Victoria!

892
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:48,962
And l hate pirates!

893
00:57:51,067 --> 00:57:52,501
Come on, cheer up.

894
00:57:52,502 --> 00:57:54,436
And now, you swabs,

895
00:57:54,437 --> 00:57:57,437
this is the big one.

896
00:57:57,807 --> 00:58:00,807
The nominees for Pirate
of the Year are as follows:

897
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:05,347
Black Bellamy.

898
00:58:05,348 --> 00:58:07,449
Cutlass Liz.

899
00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:09,852
Peg-Leg Hastings.

900
00:58:09,853 --> 00:58:12,853
And a surprise late entry,

901
00:58:13,423 --> 00:58:16,423
the Pirate Captain!

902
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:19,659
The panel of independent judges

903
00:58:20,964 --> 00:58:23,964
have counted each
pirate's booty and declared

904
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:27,834
that this year's winner is

905
00:58:29,138 --> 00:58:32,138
the Pirate Captain!

906
00:59:20,189 --> 00:59:23,189
Excuse me!

907
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:25,727
Excuse me.

908
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:27,896
Listen, this is all very moving.

909
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:30,098
I'm welling up here, but...

910
00:59:30,099 --> 00:59:33,099
Bellamy, this is most irregular!

911
00:59:33,269 --> 00:59:36,269
So is this!

912
00:59:42,645 --> 00:59:45,645
It seems Queen Victoria has
pardoned the Pirate Captain.

913
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:52,387
No!

914
00:59:52,388 --> 00:59:53,488
So what if she did?

915
00:59:53,489 --> 00:59:55,290
If you've been pardoned,

916
00:59:55,291 --> 00:59:58,291
then, technically, you're no longer a pirate.

917
00:59:58,528 --> 01:00:00,929
And if you're no longer a pirate,

918
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:03,930
you really can't be Pirate of the Year,

919
01:00:04,467 --> 01:00:06,034
now, can you?

920
01:00:06,035 --> 01:00:08,770
-No, you can't!
-That's right!

921
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:10,639
ls this true?

922
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:13,640
Well, that's one, frankly,
rather negative way of looking at it.

923
01:00:15,244 --> 01:00:18,244
Villainous treachery!

924
01:00:18,247 --> 01:00:21,183
Treacherous villainy!

925
01:00:21,184 --> 01:00:24,184
You have betrayed the pirating fraternity.

926
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:26,088
But, Pirate King...

927
01:00:26,089 --> 01:00:29,089
Your pirate hat and coat!

928
01:00:43,172 --> 01:00:46,172
Your pirate badge with googly eyes.

929
01:00:46,542 --> 01:00:49,542
And your World of Hooks discount card.

930
01:00:51,014 --> 01:00:52,748
Confiscate his treasure!

931
01:00:52,749 --> 01:00:55,450
Every last bit of it.

932
01:00:55,451 --> 01:00:58,451
Begone!
May your lubber shame bear down upon you.

933
01:00:59,288 --> 01:01:02,288
You are hereby banished from Blood Island!

934
01:01:18,474 --> 01:01:21,474
And stay out!

935
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:26,513
Yes, well, not a... Not a total success.

936
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:29,885
We don't need them and their stupid awards.

937
01:01:29,886 --> 01:01:32,886
The best thing about being
a pirate isn't the treasure.

938
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:34,990
-It's the cutlasses.
-It's Ham Night.

939
01:01:34,991 --> 01:01:36,758
It's Polly.

940
01:01:36,759 --> 01:01:39,528
Where is Polly, Captain?

941
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:41,563
What do you mean? You know where she is.

942
01:01:41,564 --> 01:01:43,965
She's been upset enough.

943
01:01:43,966 --> 01:01:46,966
Captain...

944
01:01:48,738 --> 01:01:51,738
Okay, okay.

945
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:00,880
l sold her to Queen Victoria
for a boatload of treasure.

946
01:02:01,517 --> 01:02:04,517
There, I've said it.

947
01:02:12,028 --> 01:02:14,596
Well, come on. She was just a parrot.

948
01:02:14,597 --> 01:02:16,398
l mean, she wasn't even a parrot.

949
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:18,767
Always weeing on the boat's carpets,
biting everyone.

950
01:02:18,768 --> 01:02:21,768
She gave half of us tetanus,
for goodness sake.

951
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:24,272
But she was our Polly.

952
01:02:24,273 --> 01:02:26,608
Well, you know, you should be happy for her.

953
01:02:26,609 --> 01:02:29,609
She'll be, she'll be living the high life.

954
01:02:29,846 --> 01:02:32,846
Eating gold bricks wrapped up in,
you know, swans.

955
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:40,220
Well, where are you swabs going? Come on.

956
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:43,890
Well, we'll have an adventure
somewhere tropical with those native ladies

957
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:47,260
whose outfits
don't leave much to the imagination.

958
01:02:49,232 --> 01:02:52,232
Looks like it's
just you and me now, eh, Number Two?

959
01:02:53,536 --> 01:02:55,570
Good old inseparable you and me.

960
01:02:55,571 --> 01:02:57,205
Us two against the world, eh?

961
01:02:57,206 --> 01:02:58,273
Yeah?

962
01:02:58,274 --> 01:03:00,909
Like Serrano ham and,

963
01:03:00,910 --> 01:03:03,910
you know, that other kind of ham.

964
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:07,382
Arrr.

965
01:03:07,383 --> 01:03:10,383
You can't always
just say "arrr" at the end of a sentence

966
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:14,788
and think that makes everything all right.

967
01:03:26,068 --> 01:03:28,904
Fine. Fine, go on, then. Go.

968
01:03:28,905 --> 01:03:31,606
Go!

969
01:03:31,607 --> 01:03:34,607
It's not like l need any of you, anyway.

970
01:03:35,344 --> 01:03:38,344
See if l care.

971
01:03:42,084 --> 01:03:45,084
See if l care.

972
01:05:28,791 --> 01:05:31,791
You're too late.

973
01:05:31,794 --> 01:05:33,061
She's gone.

974
01:05:33,062 --> 01:05:34,362
Charles?

975
01:05:34,363 --> 01:05:35,597
ls that you?

976
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:37,098
What are you doing here?

977
01:05:37,099 --> 01:05:40,099
We're tramps now.
It's not unlike being a scientist, but...

978
01:05:41,370 --> 01:05:44,370
...with less experiments
and more drinking your own sweat.

979
01:05:44,373 --> 01:05:47,373
But where's Polly?
Why isn't she in her cage?

980
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:50,610
It's too horrible.

981
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:53,048
"Banquet for world leaders"?

982
01:05:53,049 --> 01:05:54,516
I've been a fool for love.

983
01:05:54,517 --> 01:05:57,152
Victoria never wanted
Polly for her petting zoo.

984
01:05:57,153 --> 01:06:00,153
"Terrine of Tiger, Black Rhino Ragout,

985
01:06:00,556 --> 01:06:02,657
"Panda Face Fritters"?

986
01:06:02,658 --> 01:06:05,658
I've discovered the Queen
is a member of a terrible secret

987
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:07,729
dining society.

988
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:10,498
Kings, queens, emperors from
around the world,

989
01:06:10,499 --> 01:06:13,401
they meet on her flagship, the QV1,

990
01:06:13,402 --> 01:06:16,402
to eat the rarest and most
endangered creatures they can find.

991
01:06:18,941 --> 01:06:21,941
This year, the highlight is...

992
01:06:22,778 --> 01:06:25,778
"Dodo a l'Orange"?

993
01:06:25,781 --> 01:06:27,315
She's going to eat Polly?

994
01:06:27,316 --> 01:06:28,650
It's all my fault.

995
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:31,651
I'm an awful human being.
I'll never get a girlfriend.

996
01:06:32,788 --> 01:06:34,622
Now pull yourself together, man.

997
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:37,292
Now listen, Charles,
we've all done something unforgivable.

998
01:06:37,293 --> 01:06:38,960
I've betrayed my pirate honor,

999
01:06:38,961 --> 01:06:41,961
you've betrayed science,
and Mr. Bobo's betrayed the animal kingdom.

1000
01:06:43,032 --> 01:06:44,632
-We've got to rescue her.
-Us?

1001
01:06:44,633 --> 01:06:47,633
Against the crowned heads
of the world on an impregnable warship?

1002
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:49,371
It's impossible odds!

1003
01:06:49,372 --> 01:06:51,539
It's only impossible
if you stop to think about it.

1004
01:06:51,540 --> 01:06:53,174
Come on, we didn't evolve from slugs

1005
01:06:53,175 --> 01:06:55,577
just to sit here
drinking our own sweat, now, did we?

1006
01:06:55,578 --> 01:06:58,578
Are you with us, Mr. Bobo?

1007
01:07:01,650 --> 01:07:03,084
Oh, l say.

1008
01:07:03,085 --> 01:07:04,152
Well, pah!

1009
01:07:04,153 --> 01:07:05,653
We can do without the monkey-man.

1010
01:07:05,654 --> 01:07:07,422
Sorry, what was that about slugs?

1011
01:07:14,196 --> 01:07:17,196
Prepare to be boarded, nerds.

1012
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:30,445
It's true! You can see down ladies' tops.

1013
01:07:30,446 --> 01:07:33,446
Keep pedaling, Charles.

1014
01:07:36,218 --> 01:07:39,218
Help!

1015
01:08:10,786 --> 01:08:13,786
Neptune's nostrils. Not a thing.

1016
01:08:17,193 --> 01:08:19,661
Where the devil can she be?

1017
01:08:19,662 --> 01:08:22,662
Captain?

1018
01:08:27,069 --> 01:08:30,069
Pedal faster, Chuck!

1019
01:08:35,744 --> 01:08:38,744
But how on earth do we get on board?

1020
01:08:39,915 --> 01:08:41,449
This might sting a bit.

1021
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:43,451
l really don't...

1022
01:08:43,452 --> 01:08:45,286
Catch hold of something!

1023
01:08:45,287 --> 01:08:48,287
Good man.

1024
01:08:56,332 --> 01:08:59,332
How do you like my pygmy
elephant nuggets, Your Majesty?

1025
01:09:00,236 --> 01:09:02,537
They're good, but not quite

1026
01:09:02,538 --> 01:09:04,706
rare enough for my tastes.

1027
01:09:04,707 --> 01:09:06,141
Not rare enough?

1028
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:08,643
Only three have been seen
in the last 50 years.

1029
01:09:08,644 --> 01:09:10,845
As many as three?

1030
01:09:10,846 --> 01:09:12,147
Well, well.

1031
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:15,148
Just wait until you see what
I've got for the main course.

1032
01:09:16,118 --> 01:09:18,052
Gaston?

1033
01:09:18,053 --> 01:09:19,888
Gaston?

1034
01:09:19,889 --> 01:09:21,322
Are you there?

1035
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:22,390
Oui, Your Majesty.

1036
01:09:22,391 --> 01:09:23,458
Gaston, I think

1037
01:09:23,459 --> 01:09:26,394
-we're ready.
-Neptune's teeth.

1038
01:09:26,395 --> 01:09:28,296
There's not a moment to lose.
We've got to find that kitchen.

1039
01:09:28,297 --> 01:09:31,032
But it's hopeless.
Where do we even start to...

1040
01:09:31,033 --> 01:09:34,033
So that's why l reckon,
in a straight fight, a shark

1041
01:09:34,570 --> 01:09:36,538
-would probably beat a Dracula.
-No!

1042
01:09:36,539 --> 01:09:39,539
Course, a Frankenstein versus a jellyfish,

1043
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:42,842
well, that's a different matter.

1044
01:09:44,313 --> 01:09:47,215
All clear, Chuck.

1045
01:09:47,216 --> 01:09:49,851
Chuck?

1046
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:52,852
It's all right, Charles, I'm coming!

1047
01:09:53,389 --> 01:09:56,389
-Don't worry, I'll just...
-Charles?

1048
01:09:56,458 --> 01:09:59,458
Just... Just hang on!

1049
01:10:01,263 --> 01:10:04,263
Charles?

1050
01:10:06,402 --> 01:10:07,635
Poseidon's lips!

1051
01:10:07,636 --> 01:10:10,636
Are you all right, Charles?

1052
01:10:11,607 --> 01:10:13,541
Hey, you there!

1053
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:14,842
What are you doing here?

1054
01:10:14,843 --> 01:10:17,245
Well, now. Excellent question.

1055
01:10:17,246 --> 01:10:20,246
All exotic animals should have been
delivered to the chef by now.

1056
01:10:20,482 --> 01:10:21,716
-What?
-What is it?

1057
01:10:21,717 --> 01:10:23,952
Some sort of duck?

1058
01:10:23,953 --> 01:10:26,953
Yes, yes. That's it, yes.

1059
01:10:27,556 --> 01:10:29,157
Quack, quack.

1060
01:10:29,158 --> 01:10:30,558
Hurry up, then. Kitchen's that way.

1061
01:10:30,559 --> 01:10:32,327
Yeah, come away! Go on.

1062
01:10:32,328 --> 01:10:34,295
Quack, quack.

1063
01:10:34,296 --> 01:10:37,296
Here we go, my pretty.

1064
01:10:37,967 --> 01:10:40,967
It's time to be...

1065
01:10:42,137 --> 01:10:45,137
...delicieux!

1066
01:10:47,409 --> 01:10:50,409
Mon dieu!

1067
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:57,917
Polly, come to Daddy.

1068
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:00,221
I'm sorry, old girl.

1069
01:11:00,222 --> 01:11:03,222
l will never, ever leave you again. l promise.

1070
01:11:03,759 --> 01:11:06,759
l will never leave you.

1071
01:11:07,396 --> 01:11:10,098
Perhaps we'd best make a move.

1072
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:12,533
Yes, yes, yes, of course.
Back to the balloon.

1073
01:11:12,534 --> 01:11:13,801
Gaston?

1074
01:11:13,802 --> 01:11:15,870
Gaston?

1075
01:11:15,871 --> 01:11:18,606
Hello?

1076
01:11:18,607 --> 01:11:20,475
Captain. No.

1077
01:11:20,476 --> 01:11:22,610
Hello, Your Majesty.

1078
01:11:22,611 --> 01:11:25,611
The dodo is coming tout de suite.

1079
01:11:26,015 --> 01:11:29,015
-This really isn't wise.
-Claudette est dans la bibliotheque.

1080
01:11:29,051 --> 01:11:30,151
Please, I think we...

1081
01:11:30,152 --> 01:11:33,152
But you know, Your Majesty,
you cannot hurry the cooking.

1082
01:11:33,322 --> 01:11:36,090
Is a very delicate recipe, uh?

1083
01:11:36,091 --> 01:11:39,091
And the dodo is a very fattening dish.

1084
01:11:39,528 --> 01:11:40,995
Perhaps is not so good for you.

1085
01:11:40,996 --> 01:11:43,865
And, you know, the calories,
they will go straight to your chubby thighs.

1086
01:11:43,866 --> 01:11:45,667
-Captain.
-A minute on the lips

1087
01:11:45,668 --> 01:11:47,368
is a lifetime on the...

1088
01:11:47,369 --> 01:11:48,936
Zut alors!

1089
01:11:48,937 --> 01:11:50,071
Well, well.

1090
01:11:53,909 --> 01:11:55,743
Here you are again. And...

1091
01:11:55,744 --> 01:11:57,312
Oh, my.

1092
01:11:57,313 --> 01:12:00,313
ls that Mr. Darwin behind those feathers?

1093
01:12:00,482 --> 01:12:01,683
Hello.

1094
01:12:01,684 --> 01:12:04,684
What a delightfully unexpected surprise.

1095
01:12:05,287 --> 01:12:08,287
You know, l think, secretly...

1096
01:12:10,959 --> 01:12:13,959
...I've always loved you, Charles.

1097
01:12:14,763 --> 01:12:16,931
Gosh.

1098
01:12:16,932 --> 01:12:18,733
Really?

1099
01:12:18,734 --> 01:12:21,734
No!

1100
01:12:24,039 --> 01:12:27,039
Give me my dodo!

1101
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:29,644
Now, come on, Vickie, be sensible.

1102
01:12:29,645 --> 01:12:31,679
It's just you, a tiny queen,

1103
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:34,680
against me, a dashing terror of the high seas.

1104
01:12:34,683 --> 01:12:36,617
En garde!

1105
01:12:36,618 --> 01:12:37,785
Oh, dear!

1106
01:12:37,786 --> 01:12:40,786
Poor defenseless me.

1107
01:12:41,156 --> 01:12:44,156
What is a girl to do?

1108
01:12:46,929 --> 01:12:49,929
Now, steady on.

1109
01:12:50,332 --> 01:12:51,599
Now careful.

1110
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,968
Do you know why l really hate pirates?

1111
01:12:53,969 --> 01:12:55,069
Childhood trauma, was it?

1112
01:12:55,070 --> 01:12:58,070
Bitten by a pirate when you were a baby?

1113
01:12:58,440 --> 01:12:59,507
Beard envy?

1114
01:12:59,508 --> 01:13:01,776
It's because you're out-of-date.

1115
01:13:01,777 --> 01:13:03,578
You're dinosaurs!

1116
01:13:03,579 --> 01:13:06,579
All that "romance of the seas" guff!

1117
01:13:17,259 --> 01:13:19,761
Right, where were we?

1118
01:13:19,762 --> 01:13:21,362
Look at you.

1119
01:13:21,363 --> 01:13:24,363
You should be extinct.

1120
01:13:27,369 --> 01:13:30,369
Along with your little friend!

1121
01:13:43,752 --> 01:13:46,752
Pity you can't eat pirates, really.

1122
01:13:48,724 --> 01:13:51,724
But you'd probably taste of barnacles.

1123
01:13:52,761 --> 01:13:55,761
Whereas, dear little Polly here is going to be

1124
01:13:56,932 --> 01:13:59,932
absolutely delicious!

1125
01:14:05,574 --> 01:14:08,574
Mr. Bobo?

1126
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:10,645
Give me back my dinner!

1127
01:14:10,646 --> 01:14:13,646
-Captain, catch!
-Number Two!

1128
01:14:17,753 --> 01:14:18,953
Sorry, Vickie.

1129
01:14:18,954 --> 01:14:21,954
Dodo is off the menu.

1130
01:14:28,931 --> 01:14:31,931
No, no, stop!

1131
01:14:33,368 --> 01:14:36,368
Stop!

1132
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:41,640
Stop!

1133
01:14:42,778 --> 01:14:45,778
I'm being squashed
by giant barrels of vinegar!

1134
01:14:53,088 --> 01:14:54,322
Good work, Chuck.

1135
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:55,723
Number Two, what are you doing here?

1136
01:14:55,724 --> 01:14:57,792
How did you find me? Where are the lads?

1137
01:14:57,793 --> 01:15:00,793
Don't worry, they're on the case.

1138
01:15:05,767 --> 01:15:08,035
It's all thanks to Mr. Bobo here.

1139
01:15:08,036 --> 01:15:11,036
He rowed halfway across the ocean
to tell us what you were up to.

1140
01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:14,173
And, you know, l figured you

1141
01:15:14,309 --> 01:15:16,711
tend to end up wrapped in
sausages facing certain death

1142
01:15:16,712 --> 01:15:18,646
at about this point in an adventure.

1143
01:15:18,647 --> 01:15:20,014
Yes.

1144
01:15:20,015 --> 01:15:22,316
Yeah.

1145
01:15:22,317 --> 01:15:24,485
Yes.

1146
01:15:24,486 --> 01:15:27,486
Listen, Number Two, l...

1147
01:15:27,723 --> 01:15:30,723
l realize l let you down.

1148
01:15:34,696 --> 01:15:36,130
Sorry.

1149
01:15:36,131 --> 01:15:38,165
l let everybody down.

1150
01:15:38,166 --> 01:15:40,601
You know, I've...

1151
01:15:40,602 --> 01:15:43,602
Well, I've done some pretty appalling things
in my piratical career.

1152
01:15:44,439 --> 01:15:47,439
Like that time l used babies as squid bait.

1153
01:15:47,743 --> 01:15:49,710
Or that other time l thought it would be

1154
01:15:49,711 --> 01:15:51,946
okay to let a turtle drive the boat.

1155
01:15:51,947 --> 01:15:54,015
But the thing is...

1156
01:15:54,016 --> 01:15:56,651
l mean, what I'm trying to say is...

1157
01:15:56,652 --> 01:15:59,652
You decided to single-handedly take on
Queen Victoria's flagship,

1158
01:16:00,122 --> 01:16:02,723
in order to rescue Polly.

1159
01:16:02,724 --> 01:16:05,724
Yes, I'm afraid l did.

1160
01:16:06,595 --> 01:16:09,595
That's terrifically idiotic.

1161
01:16:09,631 --> 01:16:10,898
Yes.

1162
01:16:10,899 --> 01:16:13,899
It's also the reason why me and the lads,

1163
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:17,204
well, we still think

1164
01:16:17,205 --> 01:16:20,205
you're the best pirate on the seven sea...

1165
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:32,486
Gadzooks!

1166
01:16:32,487 --> 01:16:35,487
No!

1167
01:16:51,907 --> 01:16:54,041
Polly!

1168
01:16:54,042 --> 01:16:55,142
Oh, no, you don't.

1169
01:16:55,143 --> 01:16:58,143
Captain?

1170
01:17:05,787 --> 01:17:08,787
Kiss your beaky little friend goodbye.

1171
01:17:27,442 --> 01:17:30,011
That's it, Polly. Snip-snip.

1172
01:17:30,012 --> 01:17:32,446
Come on, little dodo. Bitey-bite.

1173
01:17:32,447 --> 01:17:34,448
The dumpy lady's got Polly!

1174
01:17:34,449 --> 01:17:37,251
Snip-snip.

1175
01:17:37,252 --> 01:17:38,486
Bite it!

1176
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:40,287
Bite it, you stupid bird!

1177
01:17:40,288 --> 01:17:43,288
Bite it!

1178
01:17:48,463 --> 01:17:50,131
No!

1179
01:17:50,132 --> 01:17:51,532
My dodo!

1180
01:17:51,533 --> 01:17:52,767
Polly!

1181
01:17:52,768 --> 01:17:55,768
My dinner!

1182
01:18:10,285 --> 01:18:13,285
Barnacles.

1183
01:18:31,339 --> 01:18:33,474
Well done, sir.

1184
01:18:33,475 --> 01:18:34,542
Hey!

1185
01:18:34,543 --> 01:18:37,511
Wah-hey, Captain!

1186
01:18:37,512 --> 01:18:40,314
Fair play to you, sir.

1187
01:18:40,315 --> 01:18:43,315
Wah-hey!

1188
01:18:44,886 --> 01:18:47,886
This is our most unexpectedly
heartwarming adventure ever.

1189
01:18:49,057 --> 01:18:51,726
You'll swing for this! Curse you!

1190
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:54,727
And after you've done swinging,
I'll chop your head off!

1191
01:18:55,030 --> 01:18:57,865
I'll put it in a cannon and fire it into the sun!

1192
01:18:57,866 --> 01:19:00,434
Does that mean he's not pardoned anymore?

1193
01:19:00,435 --> 01:19:03,435
"Pardoned"?

1194
01:19:03,505 --> 01:19:06,505
You'll be outlawed across the globe!

1195
01:19:07,242 --> 01:19:10,242
There'll be a higher price
on your head than any pirate before you!

1196
01:19:19,454 --> 01:19:21,822
Welcome back,

1197
01:19:21,823 --> 01:19:24,823
Captain.

1198
01:19:47,849 --> 01:19:49,784
-See ya!
-Bye!

1199
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:52,785
Bye-bye!

1200
01:20:01,797 --> 01:20:03,430
Well, it's been a pleasure, Charles.

1201
01:20:03,431 --> 01:20:05,266
Good luck with the science.

1202
01:20:05,267 --> 01:20:07,902
-Thank you, Captain.
-And just a little tip,

1203
01:20:07,903 --> 01:20:09,470
grow yourself a beard.

1204
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:12,471
It'll make your face look less lumpy.

1205
01:20:32,027 --> 01:20:35,027
100,000 doubloons.

1206
01:20:35,931 --> 01:20:38,931
Not bad, eh, Mr. Bobo?

1207
01:20:52,347 --> 01:20:55,347
That... l...

1208
01:20:55,717 --> 01:20:58,519
-ls this a bit of squid tentacle?
-Yeah.

1209
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:01,520
And that's my earwax.

1210
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:07,693
l keep telling you, it's never been about
the trophies or the treasure.

1211
01:21:08,230 --> 01:21:11,230
It's about who you are, inside.

1212
01:21:12,334 --> 01:21:13,901
l say, you're not...

1213
01:21:13,902 --> 01:21:16,370
Not a woman
disguised as a man, are you, Number Two?

1214
01:21:16,371 --> 01:21:17,504
No.

1215
01:21:17,505 --> 01:21:20,505
Because that does happen
surprisingly often at sea.

1216
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:40,861
Well, come on, you coves.

1217
01:21:40,862 --> 01:21:42,796
Those treasure chests
won't plunder themselves.

1218
01:21:42,797 --> 01:21:44,198
Hoist the flag!

1219
01:21:44,199 --> 01:21:46,367
Aye, aye, Captain!

1220
01:21:46,368 --> 01:21:49,368
Set a course for adventure!

1221
01:22:09,891 --> 01:22:11,725
You see? l told you.

1222
01:22:11,726 --> 01:22:12,993
Didn't l tell you?

1223
01:22:13,139 --> 01:22:16,447
Just added on for decoration, my foot.
