00:00:44,876 --> 00:00:47,045
BIRD ISLAND

2
00:01:06,481 --> 00:01:09,109
SUGAR

3
00:01:10,819 --> 00:01:12,320
Those are good worms right there.

4
00:01:12,404 --> 00:01:15,198
Hey, Alex! How's the commute treating you?

5
00:01:15,281 --> 00:01:16,574
Hey, I can't complain.

6
00:01:16,658 --> 00:01:18,743
- That never stopped him before.
- Right?

7
00:01:20,286 --> 00:01:21,830
Well, we made good time today.

8
00:01:22,706 --> 00:01:26,292
WE HEART RED

9
00:01:24,165 --> 00:01:26,292
Red was one of my students.

10
00:01:26,376 --> 00:01:28,086
WE LOVE U RED

11
00:01:29,713 --> 00:01:31,881
Not sure about the dabbing though.

12
00:01:32,424 --> 00:01:34,259
Mom! Mom, did you get my picture?

13
00:01:34,342 --> 00:01:36,094
Well, this is our stop.

14
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,307
THE APPLE STORE
OPEN

15
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:44,227
<i>The birds in the sky go through the air</i>

16
00:01:44,311 --> 00:01:47,981
<i>All the way there</i>

17
00:01:48,064 --> 00:01:51,484
Today, we're gonna learn about how Red saved the eggs.

18
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,320
I love Red!

19
00:01:53,403 --> 00:01:55,780
I gotta go to the bathroom!

20
00:01:55,864 --> 00:01:57,574
Why didn't you go in the slingshot?

21
00:01:59,326 --> 00:02:01,411
Bomb, anything from Piggy Island?

22
00:02:01,494 --> 00:02:03,663
- No.
- Chuck. Anything to the north?

23
00:02:04,998 --> 00:02:07,042
- Nope. Nothing.
- What's that?

24
00:02:07,751 --> 00:02:09,127
Incoming pie!

25
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,963
- It's coming straight for us.
- What do we do?

26
00:02:13,548 --> 00:02:14,674
Duck!

27
00:02:14,758 --> 00:02:15,717
What?

28
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,304
- I got pie all over my face!
- Hey, sorry, buddy.

29
00:02:22,265 --> 00:02:23,475
What, what? Yeah!

30
00:02:24,976 --> 00:02:26,645
Those pigs...

31
00:02:26,728 --> 00:02:27,812
Are gonna pay...

32
00:02:27,896 --> 00:02:29,898
For our lunches!

33
00:02:31,066 --> 00:02:33,777
Because of our hunger to give them...

34
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,153
A taste of their own...

35
00:02:35,236 --> 00:02:36,488
Quesadillas!

36
00:02:38,365 --> 00:02:39,240
What?

37
00:02:40,492 --> 00:02:42,410
- It's Red.
- I'm sorry, guys.

38
00:02:42,494 --> 00:02:44,871
We're taking over the Blue Line. Official business.

39
00:02:44,954 --> 00:02:46,915
- Yeah!
- Anything for you, Red.

40
00:02:47,457 --> 00:02:48,291
Hey, Red!

41
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:51,920
Isn't it funny how nobody liked you
until you saved Bird Island?

42
00:02:52,003 --> 00:02:53,046
But now we all love you.

43
00:02:53,838 --> 00:02:56,800
Thanks so much for bringing that up. Okay, ready?

44
00:02:56,883 --> 00:02:58,468
- Three...
- Two...

45
00:02:58,551 --> 00:02:59,678
Two!

46
00:02:59,761 --> 00:03:01,763
- Bomb, you say "one."
- Oh, right.

47
00:03:01,846 --> 00:03:02,806
One!

48
00:03:08,311 --> 00:03:09,688
HOT SAUCE

49
00:03:10,438 --> 00:03:13,525
TACO
HOG

50
00:03:11,356 --> 00:03:12,691
Hot sauce, please.

51
00:03:13,608 --> 00:03:15,402
Yeah! Got him.

52
00:03:15,485 --> 00:03:17,404
- Thank you very much.
<i>- Red! Red! Red!</i>

53
00:03:17,946 --> 00:03:21,032
I really want the red one. The red one.

54
00:03:21,116 --> 00:03:22,701
Balloonie!

55
00:03:22,784 --> 00:03:24,744
That's it. A little bit higher.

56
00:03:35,588 --> 00:03:38,133
But I was bouncing!

57
00:03:38,216 --> 00:03:40,468
You mess with the hatchlings,

58
00:03:40,552 --> 00:03:41,970
you get the cannonball.

59
00:03:42,053 --> 00:03:43,680
Ready, big guy?

60
00:03:43,763 --> 00:03:46,224
Oh, yeah. You ready, bigger guy?

61
00:03:50,562 --> 00:03:53,148
Cannonball! Cannonball!

62
00:03:56,609 --> 00:03:58,028
Why won't you just take a bath?

63
00:03:58,111 --> 00:04:00,488
Why won't you just take a bath?

64
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:11,082
This might pinch a little.

65
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:19,007
I can't see!

66
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:21,217
Catch you later.

67
00:04:21,301 --> 00:04:23,053
You stupid birds.

68
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,388
No! Please, don't!

69
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,560
Not on my watch.

70
00:04:32,729 --> 00:04:33,938
Sorry, guys.

71
00:04:34,022 --> 00:04:35,273
Excuse me, sir,

72
00:04:35,357 --> 00:04:37,734
but I believe this belongs to you.

73
00:04:37,817 --> 00:04:38,943
My hero.

74
00:04:39,444 --> 00:04:41,488
Don't. Stop.

75
00:04:42,072 --> 00:04:43,073
I said, "Don't stop."

76
00:04:45,325 --> 00:04:46,451
- Leonard?
- Got him!

77
00:04:46,534 --> 00:04:49,162
Hey, Leonard, you should probably--

78
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:53,708
That's not coming from Bird Island.

79
00:05:03,969 --> 00:05:05,971
What the heck is that?

80
00:05:06,054 --> 00:05:08,890
And where did it come from?

81
00:05:16,398 --> 00:05:18,358
We're gonna need a bigger slingshot.

82
00:05:26,157 --> 00:05:28,827
Another successful day of protecting the island.

83
00:05:29,244 --> 00:05:32,080
- Great job, guys.
- Oh, yeah.

84
00:05:33,623 --> 00:05:35,375
You saved us, Red.

85
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:38,586
- You're our hero.
- What can I say? That's what I do.

86
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,547
Now, why don't you run along

87
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:44,009
and keep your big, cute eyes peeled
for the next pig prank, all right?

88
00:05:46,011 --> 00:05:47,304
Pigs.

89
00:05:47,971 --> 00:05:51,933
- We're going to get you!
- Oink, oink, oink.

90
00:05:53,601 --> 00:05:54,436
Adorable.

91
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:57,397
Let's finish cleaning up these crabs,
then we can move on to--

92
00:05:57,856 --> 00:05:59,149
Done and done.

93
00:06:01,234 --> 00:06:03,361
- Red, what is it?
- What the heck?

94
00:06:03,445 --> 00:06:07,157
Is it a per--? Is it a head? What is that?

95
00:06:07,907 --> 00:06:11,286
- It seems like it's some kind of note.
- What if it's a love note?

96
00:06:11,369 --> 00:06:13,830
- A message in a bottle?
- Or a genie in a bottle.

97
00:06:13,913 --> 00:06:16,958
Guys, there's no bottle, so just, you know, stop.

98
00:06:17,042 --> 00:06:20,211
<i>Dear birds, we humbly request a truce.</i>

99
00:06:20,295 --> 00:06:21,463
<i>Can we talk?</i>

100
00:06:21,546 --> 00:06:24,424
<i>Love, Leonard. X-O-X-O.</i>

101
00:06:25,425 --> 00:06:27,177
Nice try, piggies.

102
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:30,388
We're not idiots.

103
00:06:30,472 --> 00:06:31,473
Hey.

104
00:06:31,556 --> 00:06:32,557
<i>Dear birds,</i>

105
00:06:32,641 --> 00:06:36,061
<i>you are idiots, but we are serious about the truce.</i>

106
00:06:37,812 --> 00:06:39,731
TRUCE!

107
00:06:46,071 --> 00:06:46,905
I got it!

108
00:06:46,988 --> 00:06:49,240
- Oh, no!
- Check it out, everybody.

109
00:06:49,324 --> 00:06:50,617
Let me see that.

110
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,119
- A truce! A truce!
- A truce with the pigs!

111
00:06:53,203 --> 00:06:55,330
- A truce?
- The prank war is over!

112
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:56,956
What?

113
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,043
No, this is just another one of their pranks.

114
00:07:00,126 --> 00:07:01,544
What?

115
00:07:01,628 --> 00:07:03,380
This is a huge relief, right?

116
00:07:03,463 --> 00:07:06,341
Who else was getting tired
of the constant pranking and retaliation?

117
00:07:06,424 --> 00:07:08,134
Me! This guy!

118
00:07:08,218 --> 00:07:09,886
Tired? No, no, no. Guys, listen.

119
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:12,180
Imagine all the fun things we can do now.

120
00:07:12,263 --> 00:07:14,265
I can think of one.

121
00:07:14,349 --> 00:07:17,227
- You think he'll go?
- I think we've piqued his interest.

122
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:22,148
No, no, no. Guys, we are working tirelessly,
day and night, to save the world.

123
00:07:22,232 --> 00:07:24,818
- The world doesn't need saving, Red.
- Of course they need us.

124
00:07:24,901 --> 00:07:25,986
Red.

125
00:07:26,528 --> 00:07:28,488
Come here, hon. What are you so afraid of?

126
00:07:28,863 --> 00:07:32,325
Afraid of? I-- What do I have to be afraid of?

127
00:07:47,632 --> 00:07:49,718
- I'm not afraid of anything.
- Okay, you know what?

128
00:07:49,801 --> 00:07:52,595
I'll write you a prescription for one night of fun
with your cool friends.

129
00:07:52,679 --> 00:07:54,973
- Especially Chuck.
- Come on.

130
00:07:55,056 --> 00:07:56,016
Come with us.

131
00:07:56,099 --> 00:08:00,353
- What are you talking--? Come with you to what?
- We can't tell you because you wouldn't be into it.

132
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:20,373
- Oink, oink, oink!
- Oink, oink, oink!

133
00:08:22,876 --> 00:08:24,836
Now we have all your eggs.

134
00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:27,922
Yeah, and there's nothing you can do about it, Red.

135
00:08:28,006 --> 00:08:29,674
- Oink, oink, oink.
- Oink, oink, oink.

136
00:08:30,842 --> 00:08:34,763
Laugh it up, piggies,
because you're gonna be crying in a second

137
00:08:34,846 --> 00:08:38,183
- when I kick your butts and take those rocks back.
- Eggs.

138
00:08:38,266 --> 00:08:41,353
- What?
- You said "rocks" instead of "eggs" again.

139
00:08:41,436 --> 00:08:43,313
Oh, sorry.

140
00:08:43,396 --> 00:08:45,607
I don't know why I keep doing that.

141
00:08:47,901 --> 00:08:49,903
Because they are rocks.

142
00:08:50,528 --> 00:08:52,572
Don't cry, Sam-Sam.

143
00:08:52,656 --> 00:08:53,907
I'll be right back.

144
00:08:57,327 --> 00:08:58,411
Hey, Daddy.

145
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:05,877
Just borrowing my sisters for a minute.

146
00:09:13,593 --> 00:09:15,887
Now we really have all your eggs.

147
00:09:15,971 --> 00:09:19,849
Yeah, and there's nothing you can do about it, Red.

148
00:09:19,933 --> 00:09:21,518
- Oink, oink, oink.
- Oink, oink, oink.

149
00:09:21,601 --> 00:09:23,269
Laugh it up, piggies,

150
00:09:23,353 --> 00:09:27,983
because you're gonna be crying in a second
when I kick your butts and take all your...

151
00:09:38,702 --> 00:09:40,662
Oh, crap.

152
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:44,332
PIGGY ISLAND

153
00:09:48,086 --> 00:09:50,088
Okay, we'll just--

154
00:09:53,717 --> 00:09:56,803
What is this thing that almost killed me? Frozen water?

155
00:09:56,886 --> 00:09:58,388
Who's ever heard of frozen water?

156
00:09:58,471 --> 00:10:01,016
Courtney? Courtney, bring me those images.

157
00:10:01,099 --> 00:10:04,311
What, what, what? Oh, okay, I'm coming. I'm coming.

158
00:10:04,394 --> 00:10:05,437
Give me that.

159
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,439
Oh, that looks cold.

160
00:10:07,522 --> 00:10:09,858
Three umbrellas in one drink?

161
00:10:09,941 --> 00:10:13,320
What kind of extravagant lunatic are we dealing with?

162
00:10:31,546 --> 00:10:33,048
There goes my toothpaste.

163
00:10:33,131 --> 00:10:34,424
I am tired of this.

164
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:38,845
Yes! Hot shower.

165
00:10:44,225 --> 00:10:45,894
There we go.

166
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,652
<i>Go, Zeta. You killing it.</i>

167
00:10:53,735 --> 00:10:56,613
<i>Go, Zeta. You killing it.</i>

168
00:10:56,696 --> 00:10:58,031
Zeta!

169
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,078
Come on, baby. Go get it.

170
00:11:03,161 --> 00:11:04,287
Let's go get it.

171
00:11:05,246 --> 00:11:06,623
Go get the stick.

172
00:11:21,429 --> 00:11:22,305
Oh, my gosh!

173
00:11:25,266 --> 00:11:26,768
I can't do this anymore.

174
00:11:26,851 --> 00:11:28,186
- Okay, Debbie?
- Okay.

175
00:11:28,269 --> 00:11:33,191
I'm done. I'm done living on this frozen,
seal-infested iceberg of an island.

176
00:11:33,733 --> 00:11:36,403
Fire another ice ball!

177
00:11:36,486 --> 00:11:38,321
- We can't do that, Zeta.
- Wait--

178
00:11:38,405 --> 00:11:39,864
You're torturing the engineer.

179
00:11:41,324 --> 00:11:42,617
Hello?!

180
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,828
My limbs are beginning to numb.

181
00:11:45,787 --> 00:11:49,124
Oh, yeah, I forgot about that.
You better tell him to improve his aim.

182
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:55,046
- It's about time we start living that good life.
- Good life, here we come.

183
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:59,134
I deserve to feel the hot sand squishing
between my beautiful talons.

184
00:11:59,217 --> 00:12:01,303
You deserve that and more.

185
00:12:01,386 --> 00:12:02,304
Yes, I do!

186
00:12:08,643 --> 00:12:10,854
Well, here we are.

187
00:12:10,937 --> 00:12:14,190
Are you ready, Red? Love awaits!

188
00:12:11,813 --> 00:12:14,190
SPEED DATING

189
00:12:14,274 --> 00:12:16,651
Speed dating? No. No way.

190
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:18,820
It's mating season.

191
00:12:18,903 --> 00:12:21,323
All right, lovebirds. You all know how this works.

192
00:12:21,406 --> 00:12:23,408
When you hear this sound,

193
00:12:23,491 --> 00:12:25,952
then it's time to move on to the next table,

194
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:28,747
where your soul mate just might be waiting.

195
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:32,334
- Yeah, I'm going home.
- Absolutely not. You have nothing else to do.

196
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,753
HELLO, I'M
LONELY

197
00:12:32,417 --> 00:12:37,339
Also, I hid your keys on some part of my body
and I'm not telling you where unless you stay.

198
00:12:37,422 --> 00:12:39,174
Yeah, let's party!

199
00:12:39,257 --> 00:12:42,594
- Hey, yo! Chuck's the name. Speed's the game. Like games?
- Well...

200
00:12:42,677 --> 00:12:47,098
You just entered the love lottery, and guess what. You won!
Because here I am.

201
00:12:48,016 --> 00:12:50,018
- Hi.
- Hi.

202
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,188
I eat dirt.

203
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,569
Hey, y'all!

204
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,655
Who's ready to party?

205
00:13:02,822 --> 00:13:04,282
Not me.

206
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:08,787
No, I'm actually not here
for the whole speed-dating horror-show thing going on.

207
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:12,165
This mating dance is for you.

208
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:23,551
I'd love to hear a little bit about you.
What's your favorite sign?

209
00:13:23,635 --> 00:13:24,636
This one's mine.

210
00:13:24,469 --> 00:13:26,054
CAUTION
JAZZ HANDS

211
00:13:26,137 --> 00:13:29,975
The flavor can vary greatly,
depending on the minerals in the dirt.

212
00:13:30,058 --> 00:13:33,061
I can tell which kind of worms have crawled through there.

213
00:13:33,144 --> 00:13:37,065
Or what sort of roly-polies used it to raise their family in.

214
00:13:37,774 --> 00:13:38,650
Are you mad?

215
00:13:39,234 --> 00:13:40,068
No.

216
00:13:40,151 --> 00:13:42,612
- I don't know. You look mad.
- Well, I'm not.

217
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:44,656
Yeah, you know what? Maybe it's your eyebrows.

218
00:13:44,739 --> 00:13:46,908
My eyebrows are fine. That's just the way I look.

219
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,953
It's like you've got resting bird face.

220
00:13:50,036 --> 00:13:52,247
Oh, yeah? Well, you know, that's not a thing.

221
00:13:53,915 --> 00:13:56,167
- Yes! Amazing.
- With utensils. I'm not a total animal.

222
00:13:56,251 --> 00:13:58,211
But I do enjoy eating dirt.

223
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:01,464
- Okay, worms, birdseed or just garbage from a dumpster?
- I'm sorry, what?

224
00:14:01,548 --> 00:14:04,718
Favorite food, silly. Don't think.
Just answer from your gut. Go!

225
00:14:05,635 --> 00:14:06,469
Toast?

226
00:14:06,553 --> 00:14:08,513
Okay. Toast.

227
00:14:08,596 --> 00:14:10,098
Favorite color?

228
00:14:10,515 --> 00:14:12,058
Stupid question. Red, duh.

229
00:14:12,809 --> 00:14:14,978
If you could have one superpower, what would it be?

230
00:14:15,395 --> 00:14:17,355
To disappear, like, right now.

231
00:14:17,814 --> 00:14:20,442
Okay. What do you do in your free time?

232
00:14:20,525 --> 00:14:23,361
Yeah, I mean, I don't really have any free time.

233
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:27,532
I protect Bird Island from being attacked,
and that's a full-time gig, so yeah.

234
00:14:27,615 --> 00:14:29,534
I thought I heard something about a truce.

235
00:14:30,243 --> 00:14:32,412
No. A truce, no. That's not gonna last.

236
00:14:32,495 --> 00:14:36,207
You'll have a lot more free time
now that nobody needs you anymore, so...

237
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:38,126
Okay. We are done here.

238
00:14:39,127 --> 00:14:42,130
Are you afraid to talk about your feelings?

239
00:14:42,213 --> 00:14:46,009
Hey, you know, just because I don't want
to talk about them doesn't mean I'm afraid.

240
00:14:46,092 --> 00:14:49,804
- Okay. So avoids personal questions. Unusually angry.
- Talks to herself.

241
00:14:49,888 --> 00:14:52,182
- Self-esteem issues.
- Doesn't answer her own questions.

242
00:14:52,265 --> 00:14:55,685
- Left-handed. Probably a witch.
- Looks like we're definitely incompatible.

243
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:58,104
Oh, and you needed a form to tell you that. Okay.

244
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:02,442
- I hope you have better luck annoying the next guy.
- I don't need luck. I have a formula.

245
00:15:02,525 --> 00:15:03,985
Okay. Have a nice life.

246
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,363
- Have fun being alone.
- Oh, I will.

247
00:15:07,864 --> 00:15:10,450
There he goes, like a ship in the night.

248
00:15:10,533 --> 00:15:13,745
No rudder, no purpose, no crew.

249
00:15:13,828 --> 00:15:15,538
Well, have a good night.

250
00:15:15,622 --> 00:15:18,291
TRUCE

251
00:15:52,158 --> 00:15:55,495
BIRD ISLAND BEAT
OUR HERO! TOTAL LOSER NOW BELOVED

252
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:57,580
Loser!

253
00:15:57,664 --> 00:16:00,041
Loser!

254
00:16:21,938 --> 00:16:23,440
Hello!

255
00:16:25,608 --> 00:16:28,653
Look, Red, I know we've had our differences.

256
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,864
Oh, like when you tried to eat our young?

257
00:16:30,947 --> 00:16:33,033
I come in peace.

258
00:16:33,116 --> 00:16:34,326
Ouch.

259
00:16:35,994 --> 00:16:39,414
Look, I don't want to see your face
any more than you want to see mine.

260
00:16:39,497 --> 00:16:41,041
We're all in danger!

261
00:16:41,124 --> 00:16:42,375
- Yeah. From you.
- Ouch!

262
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:44,502
No, we have a truce.

263
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:47,005
Didn't you get my note? It was on a balloon.

264
00:16:47,088 --> 00:16:49,341
Oh, yeah, that's right.

265
00:16:49,424 --> 00:16:50,759
You wanted to talk.

266
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,803
This is not how a truce works.

267
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:56,765
Just say what you gotta say and then get out.

268
00:16:56,848 --> 00:17:00,769
Red, we've discovered that there's a third island,

269
00:17:00,852 --> 00:17:04,189
- and they're plotting to destroy us all.
- A third island?

270
00:17:04,939 --> 00:17:07,567
BIRD ISLAND - PIGGY ISLAND -?

271
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:09,736
Give me one good reason why I should believe you.

272
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:13,114
Haven't you noticed any strange objects falling from the sky?

273
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,824
Giant balls of ice?

274
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:16,826
<i>But you'll look sweet</i>

275
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,620
<i>Upon the seat</i>

276
00:17:18,703 --> 00:17:19,871
<i>Of my...</i>

277
00:17:21,581 --> 00:17:25,502
<i>Bicycle built for two</i>

278
00:17:26,419 --> 00:17:28,171
Nope, nothing. Haven't seen anything.

279
00:17:28,254 --> 00:17:30,924
Well, I have, and I'll show you the proof.

280
00:17:31,007 --> 00:17:32,425
Squeal Team Six!

281
00:17:33,885 --> 00:17:35,136
What the...?

282
00:17:37,263 --> 00:17:39,391
Hey, hey, hey. Easy, easy. Stop.

283
00:17:39,474 --> 00:17:40,767
Everybody stop.

284
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:58,702
That image in your hand is Eagle Island,

285
00:17:58,785 --> 00:18:00,286
and those are eagles.

286
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,914
Eagles? How did you get these?

287
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:04,708
From a drone.

288
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:08,003
- And do you spy on us with that?
- Yes.

289
00:18:08,086 --> 00:18:10,839
So have you seen me...?

290
00:18:10,922 --> 00:18:13,299
Yes, and it's disgusting.

291
00:18:14,092 --> 00:18:16,261
Red, this is bigger than pranks.

292
00:18:16,344 --> 00:18:18,972
We need to put aside our differences and work together.

293
00:18:19,055 --> 00:18:22,350
To save our whole world from being destroyed.

294
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,477
<i>Red! Red! Red!</i>

295
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:31,234
What we really need is a hero.

296
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:32,235
I'm in.

297
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,737
Wonderful!

298
00:18:34,946 --> 00:18:38,158
We'll have to get a team together.

299
00:18:38,241 --> 00:18:39,743
Yes, we will.

300
00:18:39,826 --> 00:18:41,536
But, hey, I'm in charge.

301
00:18:41,619 --> 00:18:44,122
THE
HERO

302
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:46,249
Actually, that position's been filled.

303
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:49,419
Yeah. By me.

304
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:55,050
Oh, man, you're gonna love this guy.

305
00:18:55,133 --> 00:18:56,593
Not the smartest bird in the tree,

306
00:18:56,676 --> 00:19:00,221
but what he lacks in smarts, he makes up for in firepower.

307
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:04,768
Happy birthday!

308
00:19:05,852 --> 00:19:07,812
<i>We've got a number two at the Porta Potty.</i>

309
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,983
All right, I'm going!

310
00:19:17,113 --> 00:19:18,657
We're busting you out.

311
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:20,784
How?

312
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,412
Like that.

313
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,998
Oh, I love it.

314
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:28,917
THE EXPLOSIVES EXPERT

315
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:30,126
Bomb, what was that noise?

316
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:33,588
- You're still grounded!
- I'm an adult, Mom!

317
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:36,049
- Run.
- Bomb, get back here!

318
00:19:34,547 --> 00:19:36,716
MOMB AND BOMB

319
00:19:36,132 --> 00:19:39,928
This guy is so fast, he can beat time itself in a footrace.

320
00:19:40,011 --> 00:19:42,347
Hey, Chuck, we're putting together a team.

321
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,557
And I think we're on it!

322
00:19:57,153 --> 00:19:59,364
Come on, everybody. Let's work those booties!

323
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:07,038
I'm in.

324
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,332
THE SPEED DEMON

325
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,835
- Great!
- But how did you...?

326
00:20:11,918 --> 00:20:14,963
BT-dubs, you misspelled "heist."
It's "EI," not "IE." I corrected it.

327
00:20:15,046 --> 00:20:19,259
- Don't worry. It's a common misperception.
- Well, thank you.

328
00:20:19,342 --> 00:20:21,344
You're right. He's fast.

329
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:26,766
<i>Now, this guy is kind of a ding-dong,
but he's the only eagle we know.</i>

330
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:29,102
Well, you've come to the right eagle.

331
00:20:29,185 --> 00:20:32,856
- Tell me more.
- It's a really exciting mission to a place called Eagle--

332
00:20:32,939 --> 00:20:35,191
- Eagle Island?!
- Yes.

333
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:36,735
So you've heard...

334
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,611
Heard of it.

335
00:20:39,779 --> 00:20:42,324
FEARLESS
WARRIOR

336
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,618
Nice to meet you!

337
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:50,415
Okay, so now we just need to figure out
how this volcanic superweapon works, huh?

338
00:20:50,498 --> 00:20:54,377
We're gonna need some kind of engineering wizard, brainiac.

339
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:04,638
Yes, Chuck. You obviously have something
you want to say or sing.

340
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:07,515
I have got just the guy. It's a girl.

341
00:21:07,974 --> 00:21:09,100
My sister Silver.

342
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:11,227
She goes to Avian Academy, top of her class.

343
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:14,105
- She would be perfect.
- Yeah, she totally would.

344
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:15,398
AVIAN

345
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:17,859
- See you guys back at the dorm!
- Yeah, see you, Ella.

346
00:21:17,942 --> 00:21:20,278
Hey, good catch!

347
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:23,490
I mean, we all just thought she was weird, you know?

348
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:26,576
But she skipped four grades,
won a Junior Engineer of the Year Award,

349
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:30,747
- and then got a scholarship at Avian Academy.
- Perfect. That is exactly what we're looking for.

350
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:33,917
You are absolutely gonna love her.
But don't love her too much.

351
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,293
That's my sister, Red.

352
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:38,296
Or I'll crush every bone in your body!

353
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,756
Frisbee!

354
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:44,594
Hi, I'm Chuck. Know where the engineering department is?

355
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:50,934
With a combination of over 30 silk, wire
and cotton-based threads spun together,

356
00:21:51,017 --> 00:21:52,936
I now present to you...

357
00:21:53,019 --> 00:21:54,688
Super String!

358
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:59,609
I said, "It's Super String!"

359
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:00,944
More like "Stupid String."

360
00:22:01,027 --> 00:22:04,823
I know what you're thinking, Mike.
You're like, "What's so super about it?"

361
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:06,282
Great question, Mike.

362
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:11,413
Well, how about that it's very easily able
to withstand the pull of 18,000 more kilos

363
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:13,415
than any other string known to--

364
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:17,836
- Snooze alert.
- Known to bird-kind!

365
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,796
Or pig-kind, for that matter.

366
00:22:23,466 --> 00:22:24,759
What's up, sis?

367
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:25,927
Chuck?

368
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,763
- I'm so happy to-- It's really--
- I'm so happy to-- It's really--

369
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:31,057
- great to-- Jinx, jinx.
- Great to-- Jinx, jinx.

370
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:32,892
- Jinx!
- Jinx. One, two, three. I win!

371
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:37,605
- You can't speak until someone says your name.
- Hello? You in here?

372
00:22:38,064 --> 00:22:39,482
Hello?

373
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:41,776
- You?
- You?

374
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,486
You.

375
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,572
Wait. You know this guy?

376
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:47,866
I would answer, but you jinxed me.

377
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:50,660
Oh, okay, Chuck, I unjinx you.

378
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:53,538
This is one of my best buddies, Red. These are the guys.

379
00:22:53,621 --> 00:22:54,748
- Hi.
- We're the guys.

380
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:58,084
Guys, this is Silver, the greatest kid sister in the world.

381
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:00,378
I'm not exactly a kid anymore, Chuck.

382
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:04,299
- Oh, you'll always be my kid sister!
- Okay. Hey, everyone.

383
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:07,052
You know, I don't think this is gonna work.

384
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:10,430
It's just that I'm not sure
you're gonna be compatible with the team.

385
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:15,602
Oh, wow, it is such a pleasure to meet not you, but you!

386
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:19,939
I've never met a pig before.
Your technological achievements are amazing.

387
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:22,609
- May I shake your hoof?
- Why, thank you.

388
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:24,110
I like her.

389
00:23:25,111 --> 00:23:26,988
And this has to be Bomb.

390
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:30,700
- How'd you know that?
- Because you have a fuse coming out of your head.

391
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,410
Oh, so cool!

392
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:35,830
Backflip.

393
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:40,377
So I hear you're some kind of engineering wizard
or whatever.

394
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:42,754
I don't like to brag, but...

395
00:23:42,837 --> 00:23:43,922
CERTIFICATE OF EXCELLENCE

396
00:23:44,255 --> 00:23:47,509
Wait. Who's that?
And why is she all over these achievement awards?

397
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:50,261
THE BRAINIAC

398
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:53,974
- The kid's amazing, right?
- Not a kid anymore, Chuck.

399
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:58,103
- Tickle Train arriving at Sister Station!
- Chuck, no.

400
00:23:58,186 --> 00:24:00,438
I am a serious academic.

401
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:01,940
I am a serious...

402
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,110
Stop!

403
00:24:07,153 --> 00:24:08,655
Look how cute this is.

404
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:13,410
<i>We're sailing in the ocean, we must</i>

405
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:15,328
<i>Row! Row!</i>

406
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:17,622
<i>The eggs are in our sights and we must</i>

407
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,416
<i>Go! Go!</i>

408
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:21,418
<i>We'll get them back before our parents</i>

409
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:23,044
<i>Know! Know!</i>

410
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,255
<i>And save the day like Red, the real</i>

411
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:27,257
<i>Hero! Row!</i>

412
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:29,843
- Gotcha!
- Gotcha!

413
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:31,845
We did it.

414
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:34,347
That was so easy!

415
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:35,807
Yeah!

416
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:38,601
A little too easy, actually.

417
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:40,228
What do you mean by that?

418
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:43,106
Well, normally, when things are this easy,

419
00:24:43,189 --> 00:24:47,610
some dramatically unexpected setback occurs.

420
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:49,571
- I don't get it.
- Me neither.

421
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:52,866
Well, it's kind of hard to explain.

422
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:55,618
But it's sort of like, you know how some...?

423
00:25:01,207 --> 00:25:02,751
Oh, see? Like that.

424
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,753
Are you freaking kidding me?

425
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,924
SPECIAL FORCES MEETING

426
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,678
SECRET
MEETING!

427
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:16,222
Each of you has been selected
because you're the best in your field.

428
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:17,891
That we could find.

429
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,977
Your skills will be put to the test

430
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:23,229
facing this.

431
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:26,691
- As you can clearly see, this is a vol--
- Volcano.

432
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:30,153
"A volcano" is what my assistant was going to say.

433
00:25:30,236 --> 00:25:32,322
- Assistant? You're the assistant!
- Let go. Let go.

434
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:33,990
- No, I'm the leader.
- I'll take that.

435
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:36,785
Actually, it's a composite volcano.

436
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:39,663
You can tell by the height
and the clearly apparent vent clusters.

437
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:41,956
Okay, forget I said "volcano."

438
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,918
This is a-- It's a superweapon!

439
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:48,171
Weird because it looks just like a volcano.

440
00:25:48,254 --> 00:25:51,007
Yep, and here's the scary part.

441
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:53,760
This is their psychotic leader!

442
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:58,390
How'd that get in there? Next.

443
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:00,058
- Oh, butt shot.
- Next.

444
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:02,435
- No, no. Next. Next!
- I don't even know what I'm looking at.

445
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,435
THEY JEALOUS

446
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:06,439
- Courtney!
- I mean, you took them.

447
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:04,562
FEELING CUTE

448
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:11,194
This is their psychotic leader.

449
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,829
Hey. Buddy, do you know her?

450
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:22,831
What? Me? No.

451
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:25,959
No, definitely not, absolutely not.
Never seen her before in my life.

452
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:28,128
Who is that? I don't know!

453
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:32,340
- Not terribly convincing, but moving on.
- Great.

454
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:33,591
What's the plan?

455
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:36,011
All right, here's what we're looking at, folks.

456
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:39,514
Travel undetected to Eagle Island.

457
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:41,766
Step two:

458
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:45,312
EAGLE ISLAND

459
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:45,312
We're gonna break into the superweapon.

460
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:47,856
- Got it.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

461
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,232
And step three:

462
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,485
Deactivate the superweapon.

463
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:55,530
- Once we break in there.
- No plan...

464
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:56,072
THERE IS
NO PLAN

465
00:26:55,613 --> 00:27:01,411
Hopefully, before both our islands are destroyed
and we all die, so that's-- That's it.

466
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,707
- Right. I just have a few questions.
- Why? I explained everything.

467
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:08,752
- It's a foolproof plan.
- Yeah. How do we sneak onto the island?

468
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:11,087
What is the superweapon and how do we deactivate it?

469
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:15,800
And when you say "escape," how do you plan to do that?
I feel like this is a crucial thing to figure out.

470
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,761
I agree. Why isn't she in charge?

471
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:19,179
Told you she's super smart.

472
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:20,972
Hey, guys, hold on a second, please.

473
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:23,475
- Mighty Eagle?
- What? What? What are you looking at?

474
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:25,560
Do you have an Eagle Island map?

475
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:28,647
What? No. No, there's no map.

476
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:30,732
THIS IS A MAP OF
EAGLE ISLAND

477
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,732
- Oh, it's a map.
- Yeah, that's a map.

478
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:33,526
- Okay, I just wanna read it.
- Come on!

479
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,445
Wait a minute. Do you guys hear that?

480
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,657
- Do we hear what?
- Sounds like a whistle.

481
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:40,075
It almost sounds like a:

482
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:46,331
Hey, guys?

483
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:48,083
Run!

484
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:53,171
Emergency exit, all the way down!

485
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,509
Well, that's not safe.

486
00:27:57,592 --> 00:27:59,469
Wait! Stop!

487
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:02,013
- Holy macaroni!
- Oh, boy.

488
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:05,183
Everyone hop on!

489
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:20,073
Rewind it. Rewind it. Play it again.

490
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:21,491
Play it again. Play it again.

491
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,997
- Yes, baby! We knocked the top right off of that!
- Blow them up!

492
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,873
Glenn, you didn't mess it up this time.

493
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,834
- Boom! Up top. Or not.
- Nailed it!

494
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:32,002
Jerry, up top.

495
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:34,838
- That should send him running.
- Wait. "Him"?

496
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:36,464
Who you sending running?

497
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:39,009
Yeah. Who's "him"?

498
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:43,555
"Them." I said "them." Stop asking me stupid questions.

499
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,056
I'm so sorry.

500
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:47,559
- That was crazy.
- We could have died.

501
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:52,188
- Thanks for saving our lives, Mighty Eagle!
- Well, you can always count on--

502
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:01,906
Everyone grab the map!

503
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:10,457
Hey, it's working.

504
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,545
Left! Left! Lean to the left!

505
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:22,010
Please tell me that was your pants ripping.

506
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:23,678
I don't wear pants!

507
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,514
None of us wear pants!

508
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,153
Eight point one seconds.

509
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:44,574
Silver! No!

510
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:11,059
Hey! What is this?

511
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:16,439
Oh, well, I mean, she was, you know,
just thanking me for saving everyone, so...

512
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:17,732
I'm sorry. Saving everyone?

513
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:21,152
- Yeah. I mean, you know, the map was my idea.
- It ripped.

514
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:24,739
- Maybe because there's one too many birds on the team.
- I...

515
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,452
My mountain!

516
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,622
We are in trouble.

517
00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:35,792
- We gotta stop that superweapon.
- We gotta stop that superweapon. Jinx!

518
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:41,756
Oh, this is bad. This is really bad.

519
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,924
Eagle Mountain?

520
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:44,968
Are we gonna be okay?

521
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,513
Oh, my gah...

522
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:53,184
What happened to Eagle Mountain, Mom?

523
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:58,773
Wait a minute. Wait. Wait. Wait.
Why isn't anybody leaving? Why they not scared?

524
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:02,277
Okay. Oh, okay, okay.

525
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,612
Here's what we gonna do.

526
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:07,574
I want y'all to take all of those ice balls

527
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:10,285
and fill them up with...

528
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:12,245
molten lava.

529
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:15,999
That's not possible.

530
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:18,335
What? You never heard of thermal emulsifiers?

531
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:21,171
Well, yes, yes.

532
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:24,507
You just got to get a polyacrylamide
to enhance the nanoparticle

533
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:27,135
and surfactant association between the two materials.

534
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:29,638
Okay.

535
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:33,183
So you do that, and I'm gonna go feed my baby.

536
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:37,395
Yes, I'm finally gonna feed my baby.
There you go. Who's my baby?

537
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:38,730
You're my baby.

538
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:43,735
What--? Don't...

539
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:46,696
You better not wink at me. Don't you wink at me.

540
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,826
Who could have done this?

541
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,663
- Gosh, I can't believe it's gone.
- Red, are we gonna be okay?

542
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:57,540
- What are we gonna do?
- All right, guys, do not worry.

543
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,042
We got this.

544
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:01,586
Red here has got your back.

545
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,296
And your front and your sides.

546
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,589
And my floof?

547
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:09,219
- Yeah, even your cute little floof.
- Looks like you're gonna be okay.

548
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:13,181
So are you 100 percent sure we shouldn't evacuate?

549
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:15,642
No, Red's gonna take care of us. Right, Red?

550
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:19,270
Yes! Everybody, please, just stay calm.

551
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:22,524
- Great news! Thank you!
- Hey, y'all, we're gonna be okay. Red's here.

552
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,776
- We love you, Red!
- We need you, Red!

553
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:25,819
Oh, thank you.

554
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:27,737
Your support means the world to me.

555
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,116
Okay, Leonard, so where's our ride?

556
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:36,121
It's so cute.

557
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:39,833
Okay. And how are we all supposed to fit in--?

558
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:42,335
Oh, I think we'll manage.

559
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:47,382
Whoa, okay.

560
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:01,521
Oh, my gah...

561
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:03,106
All aboard!

562
00:33:05,442 --> 00:33:08,153
Anyone want to grab their own bag or anything?

563
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:15,076
Don't screw this up, Red!

564
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:18,955
If we die, it's kind of your fault.

565
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,419
I got this.

566
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,643
Ladies and gentlemen,

567
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:25,146
I'd like to introduce you to our master of gadgetry:

568
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,648
- Garry!
- Garry!

569
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:29,567
This is it?

570
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:34,072
This is the amazing team
I've been working around the clock for?

571
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:36,825
Working with what we got.

572
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:39,953
Well, that's disappointing.

573
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:42,455
Okay.

574
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:46,418
This is the part where you get up and follow me!

575
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:51,381
Welcome to my piggy gadget lab.

576
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:52,882
Oh, yeah.

577
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:58,722
Everywhere you look, you'll see inventions being tested
by my team of guinea pigs.

578
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:01,224
- This is so cool.
- I know. Right?

579
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:06,604
All of the gadgets have been designed specifically
with your current mission in mind.

580
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:09,357
The first being Invisa-Spray.

581
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:12,402
Need to go undetected in plain sight?

582
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:14,863
Invisa-Spray does exactly that.

583
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,698
Wow, I'm invisible!

584
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:19,326
"Whoa," indeed.

585
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:22,287
- That's amazing.
- How long does the invisibility last for?

586
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:24,414
Forever.

587
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:25,999
Wait. What?

588
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:29,127
Tina, we're not gonna be able to see each other tonight.

589
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:32,213
And what does the next gadget do? Bury us alive?

590
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:34,966
What? That would be ridiculous.

591
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:37,427
Ix-nay the shovel-ay.

592
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:40,013
And moving right along.

593
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:42,098
What? What are you guys doing?

594
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:44,225
This is so fun!

595
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:45,602
Oh, it's so squishy.

596
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,145
What is this stuff?

597
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:51,441
Well, that is a special type of flame retardant
we call pig snot.

598
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:55,779
Why do you call it...? You know what? Never mind.

599
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:05,705
Yeah! Lick it.

600
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:10,794
Now, everyone, prepare yourselves
because this next one is really something special.

601
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:13,463
So shiny.

602
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:17,884
Yes, my friend. Bold yet sleek. Simple while complex.

603
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:23,765
This device can detect an eagle anywhere
within a 100-foot radius.

604
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:29,229
- Well, how does it work?
- Simply push this button,

605
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,189
and it does the rest.

606
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,195
<i>There's an eagle nearby.</i>

607
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,823
<i>There's an eagle nearby. There's an eagle nearby.</i>

608
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,700
<i>There's an eagle nearby.</i>

609
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:45,996
<i>- There's an eagle nearby.</i>
- Why, yes. Clearly, there is.

610
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,456
- Okay, you got me, guys.
<i>- There's an eagle nearby.</i>

611
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,459
- This clever little thing will...
<i>- There's an eagle nearby.</i>

612
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:53,753
- No doubt prove to be a...
<i>- There's an eagle nearby.</i>

613
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:57,340
- Crucial tool during your mission.
<i>- There's an eagle nearby.</i>

614
00:36:57,424 --> 00:36:59,676
- Wonderful. That's amazing!
<i>- There's an eagle nearby.</i>

615
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,678
- Can you turn it off now?
<i>- There's an eagle nearby.</i>

616
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:03,972
- Actually, it'll turn itself off.
<i>- There's an eagle nearby.</i>

617
00:37:04,431 --> 00:37:06,224
Oh, thank goodness.

618
00:37:06,308 --> 00:37:09,519
One hour after it doesn't detect any more eagles.

619
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:11,187
- What?!
<i>- There's an eagle nearby.</i>

620
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:12,897
<i>- There's an eagle nearby.</i>
- Hey! Hey!

621
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:15,066
<i>There's an eagle near-</i>

622
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:17,569
- There.
- Oh, thank you.

623
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:20,238
Okay, guys, these gadgets are terri--

624
00:37:20,322 --> 00:37:23,116
Hey, hey, Red, can we chat for a sec?

625
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,953
I can tell you're used to running the show.
That's great and all.

626
00:37:27,037 --> 00:37:30,790
But maybe since we're all a team here,
a team you put together,

627
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:34,085
maybe you can try to be more supportive.

628
00:37:34,169 --> 00:37:37,130
The results might surprise you, huh?

629
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:39,090
Fine. Fine, fine, fine.

630
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:42,886
Garry. Unbelievable. Really, really good stuff.

631
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:45,597
You know what? I'm sure I can figure out a plan to...

632
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:49,684
You know, to use all this--
This awesomeness that you've-- Bomb!

633
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:54,773
Hi, Red.

634
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:03,907
How are we ever gonna get up there?

635
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:07,911
I want my unborn sisters back.

636
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:11,539
It's just, the eggs are up there, and we're down here.

637
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:14,876
Oh, how are we ever gonna get up there?

638
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,602
You're doing great, Zoe.

639
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:35,730
Now hold it tight, okay?

640
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,282
Quick, let some air out!

641
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:55,792
It won't untie!

642
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:58,169
Okay, let me try.

643
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:00,171
What's--? What's the prob--?

644
00:39:01,381 --> 00:39:03,216
Problem?!

645
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:35,957
Don't worry, guys. I'll get us out of this.

646
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,926
The eggs!

647
00:39:49,054 --> 00:39:51,640
We got you for reals now.

648
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:54,517
See? I told you I would get us out of this.

649
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:08,531
A boa constructor.

650
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:16,539
It is glorious! I'm a genius!

651
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:23,797
Yes, I love it! This was my idea.

652
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,591
- Wait. Wait.
- Look out!

653
00:40:26,675 --> 00:40:28,593
- I'm burning!
- I told you to look out.

654
00:40:28,677 --> 00:40:32,555
Glenn, I wanted lava balls, not lava puddles.

655
00:40:33,515 --> 00:40:35,392
Glenn's messing up.

656
00:40:35,475 --> 00:40:39,980
I mean, we-- We're very close.
We just need two more weeks.

657
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:42,190
Two weeks? Two weeks.

658
00:40:43,692 --> 00:40:45,485
It's quite the undertaking.

659
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:48,947
Okay, okay, you know what? I'm doing that thing again.

660
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:54,077
That thing, you know, like, where I'm not quite sure
I heard what I think I heard.

661
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:58,999
Hey, skinny, sassy face!
Did you hear "two weeks," or did you hear "tomorrow"?

662
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:02,043
I heard "tomorrow"?

663
00:41:02,127 --> 00:41:04,713
Fat dude, what did you hear?

664
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:06,339
Definitely what you said?

665
00:41:06,423 --> 00:41:08,091
Okay, you know what I'm gonna do?

666
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:10,885
I am gonna call my old engineer, Steve.

667
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:12,762
And you know what? You're a lot like him.

668
00:41:12,846 --> 00:41:15,307
ZETA
MOBILE

669
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:17,934
STEVE

670
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,891
<i>Hey, it's Steve!</i>

671
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:20,562
<i>Sorry I can't come to the phone right now,
but you know what to do.</i>

672
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:24,774
Oh, yeah. I had to discipline Steve.

673
00:41:24,858 --> 00:41:28,403
- So, what was that that you had said to me?
- Tomorrow.

674
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:31,072
That's what I thought you said. See, everybody happy now.

675
00:41:41,458 --> 00:41:43,543
SNEAK ONTO EAGLE ISLAND

676
00:42:18,745 --> 00:42:20,246
No. No, no, no.

677
00:42:23,124 --> 00:42:24,876
Careful, buddy. That's not--

678
00:42:34,678 --> 00:42:36,596
Okay, guys, let's do this.

679
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:39,349
- Here we go.
- We got an island to save, kids.

680
00:42:39,432 --> 00:42:41,559
Two islands. We have two islands to save.

681
00:42:41,643 --> 00:42:43,895
I can't do this.

682
00:42:43,979 --> 00:42:46,773
- I've made a terrible mistake.
- What are you talking about?

683
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:49,109
Zeta.

684
00:42:49,192 --> 00:42:51,569
- Who is Zeta?
- The leader of the eagles.

685
00:42:51,653 --> 00:42:54,280
The one who's been trying to destroy our islands.

686
00:42:54,364 --> 00:42:57,450
And my ex-fiancée.

687
00:42:57,534 --> 00:42:59,703
- Wait. What?!
- Did you say "fiancée"?

688
00:42:59,786 --> 00:43:03,248
- Beyoncé?
- And you're just telling us this now?

689
00:43:03,957 --> 00:43:05,333
Better late than never.

690
00:43:06,835 --> 00:43:09,337
<i>It was many years ago,</i>

691
00:43:09,421 --> 00:43:11,131
<i>in the 1990s.</i>

00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:14,092
<i>She was the smartest girl in school.</i>

693
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:17,095
<i>And I had an incredible sense of fashion.</i>

694
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:19,848
Hey.

695
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:22,225
<i>It was love at first sight.</i>

1 PAGE

699
00:43:28,315 --> 00:43:29,983
"I miss you"?

700
00:43:39,034 --> 00:43:41,953
<i>She was the best thing that ever happened to me.</i>

701
00:43:49,794 --> 00:43:53,089
<i>But since I wasn't quite ready to mate for life...</i>

702
00:43:55,592 --> 00:43:57,260
An engagement ring?

703
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:00,263
<i>Naturally, I...</i>

704
00:44:02,724 --> 00:44:04,100
<i>I...</i>

705
00:44:05,101 --> 00:44:06,561
<i>I abandoned her.</i>

706
00:44:08,521 --> 00:44:10,190
How could you leave her like that?

707
00:44:10,273 --> 00:44:12,400
Because I am a coward.

708
00:44:12,484 --> 00:44:15,987
- Many of you didn't know that about me.
- Well, actually...

709
00:44:16,071 --> 00:44:19,032
I assume she's been heartbroken ever since.

710
00:44:19,115 --> 00:44:20,617
It's all my fault.

711
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:23,036
So this is Beyoncé we're talking about?

712
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:28,500
You know what? I just remembered.
I have something to do back home!

713
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:29,834
Thanks for the help.

714
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:55,026
Well, that got dark.

715
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:08,623
Okay, gang, listen up.

716
00:45:08,707 --> 00:45:12,085
This place is crawling with security,
but if you guys follow me...

717
00:45:14,296 --> 00:45:18,174
- Hey, hey, hey, what's going on?
- What do you think, guys? Should we show him?

718
00:45:18,258 --> 00:45:19,301
Show me what?

719
00:45:19,384 --> 00:45:21,011
Harvey!

720
00:45:21,094 --> 00:45:23,722
Super lifelike disguise, right?

721
00:45:23,805 --> 00:45:24,931
Disguise?

722
00:45:25,015 --> 00:45:28,685
- We thought we'd let you drive.
- And I'm gonna help you pedal.

723
00:45:29,185 --> 00:45:32,856
Wait. You guys came up with this idea without me?

724
00:45:32,939 --> 00:45:34,274
Yeah.

725
00:45:47,579 --> 00:45:48,997
Yeah, well, it's not gonna work.

726
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:52,250
We think it's our best chance of getting past
the guards to the superweapon.

727
00:45:52,334 --> 00:45:53,418
- I'm with Silver.
- Me too.

728
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:56,671
- Yeah, she's smart.
- Everyone is counting on me to make sure that--

729
00:45:56,755 --> 00:45:59,132
Us. Everyone's counting on us, Red.

730
00:45:59,215 --> 00:46:02,927
Fine. Whatever. So your plan is to get
into the superweapon with that?

731
00:46:03,011 --> 00:46:05,430
Harvey, don't take offense. He does not mean it.

732
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,808
Fine. Fine. You know what?

733
00:46:09,267 --> 00:46:12,562
I'll just be up here saving the world.

734
00:46:13,647 --> 00:46:16,983
- Just like I should have been doing this whole time.
- Guys?

735
00:46:17,067 --> 00:46:20,111
I 100 percent believe in you and this Harvey idea,

736
00:46:20,195 --> 00:46:22,906
but I think this one's gonna need me.

737
00:46:32,832 --> 00:46:34,334
Well, they didn't see us.

738
00:46:35,377 --> 00:46:37,629
This isn't an "us" thing, Silver.

739
00:46:37,712 --> 00:46:39,839
I've got this covered. Go away.

740
00:46:41,633 --> 00:46:45,428
- Is this a good time to talk about your feelings?
- No, it's not a good time!

741
00:46:55,021 --> 00:46:57,232
No. No, I don't need your help, okay?

742
00:46:57,315 --> 00:46:59,442
I meant to slip. Leave me alone!

743
00:47:00,527 --> 00:47:02,070
Your hat fell off.

744
00:47:02,153 --> 00:47:04,739
Yeah, I got rid of it because it was getting heavy.

745
00:47:13,707 --> 00:47:16,668
All right, guys, beak action is a go.

746
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:19,337
- Arms, what say you?
- Armed and ready.

747
00:47:22,882 --> 00:47:25,302
Two fully functional armies.

748
00:47:25,385 --> 00:47:27,595
Right above our leggies.

749
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:30,890
Okay, leggies, show me what you got.

750
00:47:34,728 --> 00:47:36,062
Oh, yeah.

751
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:38,398
We got this!

752
00:47:38,857 --> 00:47:40,567
We must look amazing!

753
00:47:44,362 --> 00:47:46,948
Okay, guys, we're going live.

754
00:47:47,032 --> 00:47:48,241
Come on, Jerry.

755
00:47:48,325 --> 00:47:50,660
You know there's no snacking while we're on duty.

756
00:47:50,744 --> 00:47:52,829
But I had a really small breakfast.

757
00:47:53,288 --> 00:47:55,206
All right, I'll do the talking.

758
00:47:56,291 --> 00:47:58,418
Hello, fellow eagle guards.

759
00:47:59,669 --> 00:48:01,379
Oh, no. He's doing a voice.

760
00:48:01,463 --> 00:48:04,049
I'm running late to the old job.

761
00:48:04,132 --> 00:48:07,052
Commute was rough today for some reason.

762
00:48:07,135 --> 00:48:10,430
But the good news is I made it!

763
00:48:11,598 --> 00:48:12,807
Ninety-degree turn. Quick!

764
00:48:13,224 --> 00:48:16,102
But the good news is I made it.

765
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:18,021
ID, please.

766
00:48:19,481 --> 00:48:20,690
ID?

767
00:48:21,691 --> 00:48:23,568
Not sure I have it on me.

768
00:48:23,652 --> 00:48:26,488
- Act like you're checking your pockets.
- It's stuck!

769
00:48:28,531 --> 00:48:29,866
Stuck?

770
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:33,662
- What the heck are you doing?!
<i>- Guards, be on the alert for a possible intruder.</i>

771
00:48:33,745 --> 00:48:34,996
Wait a minute.

772
00:48:35,455 --> 00:48:37,415
- What's happening? Leonard?
- He's on to us.

773
00:48:40,168 --> 00:48:41,836
We are so dead.

774
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:46,549
All right. I know what's going on here.
I'm picking up what you're putting down.

775
00:48:46,633 --> 00:48:49,803
- Jerry, are you getting a load of this?
- Yeah, I think I am.

776
00:48:52,555 --> 00:48:55,767
Yeah, Jerry, I know exactly what's going on.

777
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:58,853
This right here...

778
00:49:00,563 --> 00:49:01,856
is obviously...

779
00:49:02,482 --> 00:49:03,692
a new guy!

780
00:49:03,775 --> 00:49:06,277
Yeah, impostors in a costume. Wait. What?

781
00:49:09,364 --> 00:49:12,492
Yeah! You're the new guard for the east tower.

782
00:49:13,576 --> 00:49:15,954
Yes.

783
00:49:16,037 --> 00:49:18,415
Yes, I am.

784
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:20,500
I knew it.

785
00:49:20,583 --> 00:49:23,420
- Jerry, swipe the new guy in.
- Okay.

786
00:49:24,796 --> 00:49:26,756
Thank you so much.

787
00:49:28,842 --> 00:49:30,302
Okay, guys, we're in.

788
00:49:30,385 --> 00:49:31,636
Oh, yeah.

789
00:49:33,263 --> 00:49:35,598
- We did it.
- Work it. Work it.

790
00:49:35,682 --> 00:49:37,642
- Okay, okay.
- Wiggle the butt.

791
00:49:37,726 --> 00:49:39,436
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

792
00:49:49,404 --> 00:49:51,239
Come on, come on. Let's go. Let's go!

793
00:49:59,331 --> 00:50:00,790
BREAK INTO THE SUPERWEAPON

794
00:50:01,207 --> 00:50:05,295
Get to the top of the superweapon. Check!

795
00:50:06,713 --> 00:50:07,922
You did it.

796
00:50:11,551 --> 00:50:15,347
- Okay, so how's it looking down there?
- Do you see that?

797
00:50:16,348 --> 00:50:18,308
Oh, it's the superweapon.

798
00:50:18,391 --> 00:50:21,436
No, the power supply to the superweapon.

799
00:50:21,770 --> 00:50:25,607
All we gotta do is get down there and cut it.

800
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:30,779
Okay, assuming we don't get electrocuted,
there are guards there, there and there.

801
00:50:32,322 --> 00:50:33,823
And we don't have enough rope to--

802
00:50:33,907 --> 00:50:36,743
- Watch and learn.
- What? What are you doing?

803
00:50:37,369 --> 00:50:38,995
He's not clipped in.

804
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:47,128
Red, are you crazy?

805
00:50:47,212 --> 00:50:49,756
Trust me. I know what I'm do--

806
00:50:59,766 --> 00:51:03,603
- So yeah. Rope wasn't long enough.
- I know that.

807
00:51:03,687 --> 00:51:05,772
It wasn't supposed to be. That's part of my plan.

808
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:08,900
Except I wanted to be over on that side.

809
00:51:08,984 --> 00:51:10,944
- Okay, but...
- Watch this!

810
00:51:16,157 --> 00:51:17,867
Nope. No, no, no.

811
00:51:20,245 --> 00:51:21,079
Hello.

812
00:51:22,414 --> 00:51:25,333
Hi. Now my plan really starts.

813
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:35,844
Hi again.

814
00:51:35,927 --> 00:51:38,513
I swung back over to tell you something,
but I forgot what it was. Okay, bye.

815
00:51:40,807 --> 00:51:43,893
Got it. Got it. Okay, there we go.
There we go. Grip, grip, grip. Okay...

816
00:51:47,897 --> 00:51:48,898
You hear something?

817
00:51:50,191 --> 00:51:53,403
- So you want a push?
- Yes.

818
00:51:58,450 --> 00:51:59,951
- Hi.
- Oh, no. Your feather!

819
00:52:00,452 --> 00:52:01,619
The guards!

820
00:52:03,371 --> 00:52:04,289
Watch out.

821
00:52:06,249 --> 00:52:08,168
Silver, what are you doing?

822
00:52:23,308 --> 00:52:24,142
Oh, no.

823
00:52:24,225 --> 00:52:25,560
Where's Red?

824
00:52:25,644 --> 00:52:27,187
Hey, Silver.

825
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:28,271
Check it out.

826
00:52:28,355 --> 00:52:31,232
This is how a hero saves the world.

827
00:52:35,528 --> 00:52:38,281
Oh, come on! Nothing works around here!

828
00:52:38,365 --> 00:52:40,033
Now we escape.

829
00:52:46,498 --> 00:52:49,250
You two are coming with me.

830
00:52:49,334 --> 00:52:51,670
- I...
- Nice abs.

831
00:52:51,753 --> 00:52:52,796
I know.

832
00:52:55,590 --> 00:53:00,887
TOP SECRET
SUPER WEAPON

833
00:52:57,634 --> 00:52:59,970
Okay, try zero-zero-zero-zero.

834
00:53:00,971 --> 00:53:02,180
Okay, now try one-two-three-four.

835
00:53:02,889 --> 00:53:04,307
Now try four-three-two-one.

836
00:53:04,391 --> 00:53:05,934
Try 1-800-OPEN.

837
00:53:06,518 --> 00:53:08,520
I don't know. Chuck, what's your birthday?

838
00:53:08,603 --> 00:53:10,021
Nothing's working!

839
00:53:11,189 --> 00:53:12,816
Oh, no. Someone's coming.

840
00:53:12,899 --> 00:53:13,900
Quick. Hide.

841
00:53:16,611 --> 00:53:17,529
Ouch.

842
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,615
<i>There's an eagle nearby.</i>

843
00:53:20,699 --> 00:53:22,993
<i>There's an eagle nearby. There's an eagle near-</i>

844
00:53:26,579 --> 00:53:28,999
You get started on the lockdown sequence.

845
00:53:29,082 --> 00:53:31,126
- I'm gonna hit the john.
- Yes, sir.

846
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:36,131
We gotta get that key card.

847
00:53:51,771 --> 00:53:53,732
Okay, Courtney, get that card.

848
00:53:58,194 --> 00:53:59,779
There's something in the way.

849
00:54:01,614 --> 00:54:03,700
Chuck, what's going on down there?

850
00:54:06,077 --> 00:54:07,996
There's a divider in the way.

851
00:54:12,292 --> 00:54:13,835
Maybe it's on the other side.

852
00:54:20,508 --> 00:54:22,594
Okay, hold on.

853
00:54:34,939 --> 00:54:36,399
Pretend to pee-pee.

854
00:54:53,416 --> 00:54:54,834
Oh, no. He's leaving.

855
00:54:54,918 --> 00:54:56,252
Chuck, get that card.

856
00:54:57,295 --> 00:54:58,296
I got it.

857
00:55:22,946 --> 00:55:24,906
Yeah, I'm just gonna...

858
00:55:41,423 --> 00:55:42,674
We're home!

859
00:55:42,757 --> 00:55:44,426
We're home, everybody.

860
00:55:53,435 --> 00:55:57,147
Oh, we missed you so much, Bird Island.

861
00:55:57,230 --> 00:55:58,606
"Bird Island"?

862
00:55:59,441 --> 00:56:01,609
This is Piggy Island, sillies.

863
00:56:01,693 --> 00:56:04,529
Bird Island is way over there.

864
00:56:13,079 --> 00:56:14,706
We're in!

865
00:56:14,789 --> 00:56:17,876
Oh, my goodness gravy.

866
00:56:24,132 --> 00:56:25,467
I want to see.

867
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:27,302
- No. Chuck, hold on!
- I just want to see.

868
00:56:27,385 --> 00:56:30,263
- We don't have time for this.
- You're stepping on my face. Move over.

869
00:56:50,075 --> 00:56:51,826
What? What's happening?

870
00:56:51,910 --> 00:56:54,412
I think he's challenging us to a break-dance battle?

871
00:57:04,089 --> 00:57:06,049
Oh, it's on!

872
00:57:13,014 --> 00:57:15,725
- What's happening?
- Looks like a little popping and locking.

873
00:57:15,809 --> 00:57:16,810
A little what?

874
00:57:18,144 --> 00:57:19,854
Pop, pop, pop!

875
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:25,777
Hey, handsome.

876
00:57:26,444 --> 00:57:30,281
- Hey.
- Take those two and put them on ice.

877
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:34,995
- They've got Red and my sister. We've gotta go.
- But the superweapon.

878
00:57:35,078 --> 00:57:36,871
That's my sister, mister.

879
00:57:36,955 --> 00:57:39,874
- And I'm gonna save her.
- Chuck, slow down.

880
00:57:39,958 --> 00:57:41,418
Slow down. Stop!

881
00:58:01,187 --> 00:58:02,564
Oh, yeah!

882
00:58:14,326 --> 00:58:15,160
Hey.

883
00:58:17,203 --> 00:58:18,913
Hey. You done?

884
00:58:18,997 --> 00:58:20,415
- What happened?
- Oh, let's see.

885
00:58:20,498 --> 00:58:24,544
You got us captured and trapped in ice
on top of giant pool toys.

886
00:58:24,628 --> 00:58:25,629
Good job.

887
00:58:25,712 --> 00:58:28,048
I just thought that maybe if I could...

888
00:58:28,131 --> 00:58:29,966
Stop me?

889
00:58:30,050 --> 00:58:33,887
Yeah, you two lovebirds just thought
y'all could sail over here and stop me.

890
00:58:33,970 --> 00:58:35,430
- Lovebirds? No way.
- No, no, no.

891
00:58:35,513 --> 00:58:38,892
- I mean, we're barely, like, friend birds.
- So typical.

892
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:42,479
Type-A male paired with a strong female,

893
00:58:42,562 --> 00:58:44,939
and you just can't stand it, can you?

894
00:58:45,023 --> 00:58:48,193
- Well, I...
- Let me guess. You prefer to fly solo.

895
00:58:48,276 --> 00:58:51,071
I have to save everybody

896
00:58:51,154 --> 00:58:53,073
all by myself!

897
00:58:53,156 --> 00:58:54,532
Just like a man.

898
00:58:55,033 --> 00:58:57,077
Ouch. That is kind of true though.

899
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:59,496
Maybe she was a little clingy at times.

900
00:58:59,579 --> 00:59:03,458
Maybe she gave you that engagement ring
a little bit too early.

901
00:59:03,541 --> 00:59:05,627
I don't think she's talking about us.

902
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:08,505
Maybe she's talking about Mighty Eagle.

903
00:59:08,588 --> 00:59:11,675
- Debbie! Turn on the TV.
- Yes.

904
00:59:11,758 --> 00:59:13,176
Okay...

905
00:59:13,259 --> 00:59:16,179
- It's the one with the red button on top.
- Okay...

906
00:59:16,262 --> 00:59:17,639
Red, Debbie.

907
00:59:17,722 --> 00:59:21,726
What I'm planning to do is take
these little-bitty, undeveloped islands...

908
00:59:19,015 --> 00:59:25,897
BIRD ISLAND - PIG ISLAND

909
00:59:21,810 --> 00:59:25,897
...and turn them into my own personal paradise.

910
00:59:26,690 --> 00:59:27,857
You're insane!

911
00:59:27,941 --> 00:59:31,319
I am putting myself first.

912
00:59:31,403 --> 00:59:35,907
Because you know what?
I worked hard for it, and I deserve it.

913
00:59:35,991 --> 00:59:38,660
All I gotta do is clear out all these inhabitants.

914
00:59:39,786 --> 00:59:41,746
You're a monster!

915
00:59:41,830 --> 00:59:44,249
Glenn, show them what I'm talking about.

916
00:59:46,584 --> 00:59:49,212
Excuse me? Are you getting smart with me right now?

917
00:59:54,426 --> 00:59:58,930
I can't believe we're soaring through the sky! Sky!

918
00:59:59,264 --> 01:00:02,851
All thanks to our pig pals, they are cool guys!

919
01:00:02,934 --> 01:00:05,812
- Guys!
- No!

920
01:00:05,895 --> 01:00:08,148
What the heck was that?

921
01:00:08,231 --> 01:00:09,899
Piggy Island?!

922
01:00:11,109 --> 01:00:16,156
Attention, everyone!
It is imperative that you all run for your lives!

923
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:23,830
Bird Island?!

924
01:00:23,913 --> 01:00:25,582
My mommy and daddy.

925
01:00:32,297 --> 01:00:34,257
Terence? Where are the kids?

926
01:00:35,759 --> 01:00:37,844
Where are the kids?!

927
01:00:39,846 --> 01:00:43,892
I don't understand. I thought Red was supposed to save us!

928
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:51,358
Oh, my gah...

929
01:00:54,986 --> 01:00:56,154
Oh, my gah.

930
01:01:01,159 --> 01:01:02,494
It actually worked.

931
01:01:02,577 --> 01:01:03,620
Yes, yes, yes!

932
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:07,040
Those islands are filled with innocent birds and pigs!

933
01:01:07,791 --> 01:01:10,126
You all had the chance to evacuate.

934
01:01:10,210 --> 01:01:13,755
But for some reason, you didn't.

935
01:01:14,923 --> 01:01:18,718
So you are 100 percent sure we shouldn't evacuate?

936
01:01:18,802 --> 01:01:21,930
I am sure. No one needs to evacuate.

937
01:01:22,013 --> 01:01:23,890
Everybody just stay calm.

938
01:01:25,433 --> 01:01:26,267
Sorry.

939
01:01:27,102 --> 01:01:29,896
Not sorry. I'm truly not sorry.

940
01:01:41,074 --> 01:01:42,993
Dodged that bullet.

941
01:01:43,284 --> 01:01:44,119
STORE
MODEL

942
01:01:44,202 --> 01:01:46,538
MIGHTY
EAGLE

943
01:01:52,168 --> 01:01:57,424
BIRD
SEED

944
01:02:08,518 --> 01:02:09,728
ME + ZETA

945
01:02:19,946 --> 01:02:21,698
This is all my fault.

946
01:02:21,781 --> 01:02:23,658
Red, it's not your fault.

947
01:02:23,742 --> 01:02:27,078
No. It-- It is my fault.

948
01:02:27,162 --> 01:02:29,539
I put myself before everyone else.

949
01:02:30,665 --> 01:02:34,377
I was afraid if I wasn't a hero anymore,

950
01:02:34,461 --> 01:02:35,629
they'd all stop...

951
01:02:36,713 --> 01:02:38,298
They'd all stop liking me.

952
01:02:38,381 --> 01:02:44,346
Oh, Red. So you did all of this
because you were afraid of not being liked?

953
01:02:44,429 --> 01:02:45,388
I...

954
01:02:46,848 --> 01:02:47,682
Yes.

955
01:02:47,766 --> 01:02:50,143
My fellow eagles,

956
01:02:50,226 --> 01:02:52,604
who's tired of living in an icy wasteland?

957
01:02:52,687 --> 01:02:54,272
We are!

958
01:02:54,356 --> 01:02:55,649
What is she doing?

959
01:02:55,732 --> 01:02:58,610
Who is tired of sipping hot chocolate

960
01:02:58,693 --> 01:03:00,528
and getting brain freeze?

961
01:03:01,738 --> 01:03:02,781
Me!

962
01:03:06,284 --> 01:03:08,495
Who's tired of frozen dinners?

963
01:03:08,578 --> 01:03:10,372
Whoa, frozen dinners?

964
01:03:10,455 --> 01:03:11,998
Come on, Bomb, let's go.

965
01:03:12,082 --> 01:03:16,878
Who's tired of playing only Vanilla Ice, Ice-T and Ice Cube?

966
01:03:17,379 --> 01:03:18,672
I am.

967
01:03:18,755 --> 01:03:23,635
Who wants to live worry-free under a beautiful tropical sun?

968
01:03:23,718 --> 01:03:26,304
Me! I want to be hot!

969
01:03:26,388 --> 01:03:28,181
I want it hot!

970
01:03:28,264 --> 01:03:29,683
There's no turning back!

971
01:03:29,766 --> 01:03:32,519
The future we deserve is about to be ours!

972
01:03:32,602 --> 01:03:34,771
Glenn! Activate the weapon!

973
01:03:34,854 --> 01:03:36,940
Start the countdown.

974
01:03:37,941 --> 01:03:39,609
<i>Ten minutes to launch.</i>

975
01:03:50,495 --> 01:03:52,163
All right, stand back.

976
01:03:52,247 --> 01:03:53,832
- Wait, did you hear that too?
- Bomb?

977
01:03:57,419 --> 01:03:58,878
What in the...?

978
01:03:59,337 --> 01:04:02,549
- Really, guys?
- What? No. We weren't...

979
01:04:03,049 --> 01:04:04,259
Yeah, they were.

980
01:04:04,342 --> 01:04:06,803
Guys, why is that clock counting backwards?

981
01:04:06,886 --> 01:04:09,431
- We've only got 10 minutes.
- It's now or never.

982
01:04:09,514 --> 01:04:12,142
Pig-kind and bird-kind are depending on us.

983
01:04:12,225 --> 01:04:14,144
What are we gonna do, Red?

984
01:04:14,227 --> 01:04:15,729
Well, I...

985
01:04:17,355 --> 01:04:18,982
I think...

986
01:04:19,065 --> 01:04:22,152
in times like these, we need someone who can lead.

987
01:04:22,235 --> 01:04:24,070
We need a hero.

988
01:04:24,154 --> 01:04:26,740
You know what we need? We need Silver.

989
01:04:31,619 --> 01:04:34,831
- Got any ideas?
- I've got a few, actually.

990
01:04:35,123 --> 01:04:37,500
THE
PLAN

991
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:38,418
Okay.

992
01:04:38,501 --> 01:04:40,170
That's the heart of the superweapon,

993
01:04:40,253 --> 01:04:43,882
and if you look closely,
you can see that it's powered by air pressure.

994
01:04:43,965 --> 01:04:46,801
Moisture around a composite volcano instantly vaporizes,

995
01:04:46,885 --> 01:04:50,513
sending a plume of highly pressurized steam
to the surface.

996
01:04:50,597 --> 01:04:53,433
That steam is contained by the pressure chamber.

997
01:04:53,516 --> 01:04:55,685
And that's the part we need to destroy.

998
01:04:55,769 --> 01:04:58,813
Only problem is, it's surrounded by armed guards.

999
01:04:58,897 --> 01:05:01,900
Bomb. Do you think you can take out those guards?

1000
01:05:01,983 --> 01:05:03,526
Some of them look kind of tough.

1001
01:05:03,610 --> 01:05:06,321
- It won't be easy.
- Yeah, right. Of course. Got it.

1002
01:05:06,404 --> 01:05:10,033
Great. Chuck, I need you to disable the security cameras.

1003
01:05:10,116 --> 01:05:12,702
<i>- There's a bunch of them, so you'll have to work fast.
- Fast?</i>

1004
01:05:13,536 --> 01:05:14,913
Don't even worry about it, sis.

1005
01:05:14,996 --> 01:05:18,249
Red, you and I have to get inside one of those ice balls.

1006
01:05:18,333 --> 01:05:20,168
Inside an ice ball?

1007
01:05:20,251 --> 01:05:21,753
I-- Sure. Okay.

1008
01:05:21,836 --> 01:05:26,466
Leonard, Courtney, Garry, do you see
that giant lever near the orange lava tube?

1009
01:05:26,549 --> 01:05:29,177
- Copy that.
- I need you to pull it all the way down.

1010
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:32,305
That will create a ramp so that
when Red and I roll down in the ice ball,

1011
01:05:32,389 --> 01:05:36,434
we'll be launched through the air
at the perfect trajectory to take out the superweapon.

1012
01:05:36,518 --> 01:05:38,395
<i>- Got it?
- Now you're talking.</i>

1013
01:05:36,685 --> 01:05:38,395
DESTROYED

1014
01:05:38,478 --> 01:05:39,729
- Great plan, Silver.
- Great.

1015
01:05:39,813 --> 01:05:41,231
Mama would be so proud.

1016
01:05:41,314 --> 01:05:43,733
Okay, everyone put your wings and hooves in.

1017
01:05:45,819 --> 01:05:48,363
Go, team!

1018
01:05:59,874 --> 01:06:02,377
Chuck, let us know when you've disabled the cameras.

1019
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:04,296
Okay. On it.

1020
01:06:08,091 --> 01:06:09,926
Easy, boys.

1021
01:06:21,021 --> 01:06:22,397
CRAZY RICH AVIANS

1022
01:06:26,234 --> 01:06:28,403
- Hey, Jerry.
- Yeah?

1023
01:06:28,486 --> 01:06:30,655
- Come here. Look at this.
- What's up?

1024
01:06:30,739 --> 01:06:33,408
NORMAL
GARD

1025
01:06:33,491 --> 01:06:35,785
It says everything's normal.

1026
01:06:40,540 --> 01:06:41,666
TOILET

1027
01:06:41,750 --> 01:06:44,711
ALL
GOOD!

1028
01:06:42,667 --> 01:06:44,169
Jerry, are you seeing this?

1029
01:06:45,378 --> 01:06:47,255
I don't see anything.

1030
01:06:47,339 --> 01:06:48,882
No, not that one.

1031
01:06:48,965 --> 01:06:50,216
Not over here.

1032
01:06:51,676 --> 01:06:52,802
Oh, I think this one's it.

1033
01:07:06,191 --> 01:07:08,234
I'll be here when you get out.

1034
01:07:06,191 --> 01:07:07,484
I'll be here when you get out.

1035
01:07:09,277 --> 01:07:10,111
Same.

1036
01:07:09,319 --> 01:07:10,236
Same.

1037
01:07:16,785 --> 01:07:20,747
We just need to get over to that track
and follow it up to the lever.

1038
01:07:20,830 --> 01:07:22,290
- Okay.
- Okay.

1039
01:07:24,084 --> 01:07:25,835
Don't touch the lava tube.

1040
01:07:25,919 --> 01:07:27,921
I don't know if I'm gonna fit.

1041
01:07:28,797 --> 01:07:30,006
Just suck in your butt.

1042
01:07:37,681 --> 01:07:38,974
Does anyone smell bacon?

1043
01:07:49,150 --> 01:07:51,903
No one can see me. Light on my toes.

1044
01:07:54,072 --> 01:07:56,658
<i>I'm sneaking
I'm sneaking up real quiet</i>

1045
01:07:57,742 --> 01:07:59,369
<i>Who took you out?
I don't know</i>

1046
01:07:59,452 --> 01:08:02,831
<i>Because I didn't hear them coming
Because they snuck up on me</i>

1047
01:08:02,914 --> 01:08:04,499
Captain, you seeing this?

1048
01:08:06,835 --> 01:08:07,794
No one sees me.

1049
01:08:07,877 --> 01:08:09,129
Take them out.

1050
01:08:10,213 --> 01:08:14,217
So why didn't you just team up with Chuck?
He's definitely faster than me.

1051
01:08:14,301 --> 01:08:15,969
Nope, he's too light.

1052
01:08:16,052 --> 01:08:18,888
Why not Bomb, then? You know, he's heavier than me.

1053
01:08:19,514 --> 01:08:21,474
Too slow. You're perfect.

1054
01:08:21,558 --> 01:08:25,061
Oh, that's funny. I thought we weren't compatible.

1055
01:08:26,354 --> 01:08:28,064
Yeah. Well, you know...

1056
01:08:28,148 --> 01:08:31,401
Some of the variables changed, so...

1057
01:08:31,484 --> 01:08:32,777
Oh, variables, huh?

1058
01:08:33,570 --> 01:08:35,322
So, what are we doing here?

1059
01:08:36,906 --> 01:08:39,617
- We're on a mission.
- Oh, yeah, the mission. Of course.

1060
01:08:39,993 --> 01:08:41,870
Okay, Bomb, we are in position.

1061
01:08:41,953 --> 01:08:44,039
Time to take out those guards.

1062
01:08:44,122 --> 01:08:45,332
Copy that.

1063
01:08:45,707 --> 01:08:48,418
Come on, Bomb, hold it together.
Tighten up. You can do this.

1064
01:08:52,422 --> 01:08:56,468
- We got a 10-91G in the control room.
- Roger that.

1065
01:09:03,683 --> 01:09:05,060
You can do this, Bomb.

1066
01:09:05,143 --> 01:09:07,937
Just take them out. Just take them out!

1067
01:09:09,314 --> 01:09:11,399
Thanks for taking us out, man.

1068
01:09:12,150 --> 01:09:14,069
Even Glenn's having a good time!

1069
01:09:14,152 --> 01:09:16,863
<i>Baby shark, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo</i>

1070
01:09:16,946 --> 01:09:19,074
<i>Baby shark, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo</i>

1071
01:09:19,157 --> 01:09:21,868
<i>- Baby shark, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
- Baby shark</i>

1072
01:09:21,951 --> 01:09:26,039
- All together!
- Silver, baby sharks have taken the bait.

1073
01:09:26,122 --> 01:09:29,000
Roger that. Okay, Leonard. Time for Plan X.

1074
01:09:29,084 --> 01:09:31,795
<i>Plan X? I thought you said spandex.</i>

1075
01:09:31,878 --> 01:09:33,004
- Spandex?
- Spandex?

1076
01:09:37,592 --> 01:09:40,804
Well, I'm working with what I got. Looking good, guys.

1077
01:09:40,887 --> 01:09:42,806
Looking good.

1078
01:09:44,516 --> 01:09:45,976
You gotta swing your arms.

1079
01:09:46,059 --> 01:09:49,145
- I am swinging my arms.
- I'm swinging them like this.

1080
01:09:58,571 --> 01:09:59,531
Yes!

1081
01:10:00,448 --> 01:10:02,492
Three minutes to launch.

1082
01:10:02,575 --> 01:10:04,661
Debbie, we are starting over, girl.

1083
01:10:04,744 --> 01:10:06,329
This is like New Year's.

1084
01:10:06,413 --> 01:10:09,749
Oh, my gosh, yes, okay.
I'm gonna get some glitter and decorations.

1085
01:10:09,833 --> 01:10:11,835
This is gonna be so much fun!

1086
01:10:18,383 --> 01:10:19,551
Zeta!

1087
01:10:19,634 --> 01:10:21,511
We have a problem.

1088
01:10:22,804 --> 01:10:23,888
Oh, my good--

1089
01:10:25,056 --> 01:10:27,142
Go find them!

1090
01:10:30,979 --> 01:10:33,189
Okay. That's where the ice balls are made.

1091
01:10:35,483 --> 01:10:39,321
We've gotta jump in that hole
at the exact moment that the jaws open up.

1092
01:10:39,404 --> 01:10:41,656
- Are you sure about this?
- Actually, no.

1093
01:10:41,740 --> 01:10:44,117
- Going with my gut this time.
- Didn't expect that.

1094
01:10:44,993 --> 01:10:48,705
<i>Attention, all eagles. The prisoners have escaped.</i>

1095
01:10:48,788 --> 01:10:50,582
<i>- Doo-doo, doo-doo
- Daddy shark</i>

1096
01:10:50,665 --> 01:10:51,958
All right, guys, back to work!

1097
01:10:52,042 --> 01:10:54,961
- Go! Let's do this!
- Guys, guys, guys! Hold on!

1098
01:10:55,045 --> 01:10:58,131
We're not done hanging out and having a good time.

1099
01:10:58,214 --> 01:10:59,966
Silver, we've got a problem.

1100
01:11:00,050 --> 01:11:03,470
<i>- Back to work, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Back to work</i>

1101
01:11:03,553 --> 01:11:05,513
- We'll jump on the count of three.
- Got it.

1102
01:11:05,597 --> 01:11:07,265
One, two...

1103
01:11:08,558 --> 01:11:09,559
three!

1104
01:11:22,614 --> 01:11:25,283
It worked! Red?

1105
01:11:25,367 --> 01:11:26,660
We did it!

1106
01:11:31,998 --> 01:11:34,626
- Oh, no. What the...?
- Lava injectors!

1107
01:11:36,044 --> 01:11:37,128
I got this one.

1108
01:11:38,296 --> 01:11:39,673
Oh, whoa, Red!

1109
01:11:49,516 --> 01:11:51,935
Well, it's all downhill from here.

1110
01:11:56,773 --> 01:11:59,734
- Okay, now what?
- If my calculations are correct,

1111
01:11:59,818 --> 01:12:03,238
we should be tall enough to reach that lever
if all three of us--

1112
01:12:03,321 --> 01:12:04,155
Garry?

1113
01:12:10,829 --> 01:12:12,330
Hang in there!

1114
01:12:17,544 --> 01:12:19,379
Okay, new plan.

1115
01:12:19,462 --> 01:12:21,756
We need to get to 65 miles per hour.

1116
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:25,135
- Left, right, left, right.
- At least we're gonna get all our steps in today.

1117
01:12:25,218 --> 01:12:28,388
<i>- Two minutes to launch.</i>
- Two minutes, everybody!

1118
01:12:28,471 --> 01:12:30,974
Two minutes to launch!

1119
01:12:31,057 --> 01:12:33,268
- Left, right, left, right.
- Left, right, left, right.

1120
01:12:33,351 --> 01:12:35,520
We gotta break that superweapon!

1121
01:12:36,104 --> 01:12:37,439
- Leonard.
<i>- Yeah?</i>

1122
01:12:37,522 --> 01:12:39,858
- Is the ramp elevated?
- We're working on it.

1123
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:43,820
What are we gonna do?

1124
01:12:44,612 --> 01:12:46,823
- Okay, let's just figure this out.
- I have an idea.

1125
01:12:46,906 --> 01:12:48,742
Yeah, yeah. Now is not the time, Courtney.

1126
01:12:48,825 --> 01:12:52,120
I'm just trying to figure out
how we're gonna get up to that lever.

1127
01:12:52,203 --> 01:12:54,080
Hey. Leonard.

1128
01:12:54,164 --> 01:12:55,832
Oh, that could work!

1129
01:12:56,625 --> 01:12:58,543
Silver! How we doing on speed?

1130
01:12:58,627 --> 01:13:02,631
We're maxing out at 59 miles per hour.
We need to get to 65!

1131
01:13:04,132 --> 01:13:08,219
- It's stuck! We need more weight!
- Okay. Here goes.

1132
01:13:10,305 --> 01:13:12,182
It-- It's moving!

1133
01:13:14,142 --> 01:13:15,226
Oh, that's not good.

1134
01:13:21,858 --> 01:13:24,486
Sixty-three, 64...

1135
01:13:25,487 --> 01:13:26,946
- One more minute!
- Yes!

1136
01:13:27,030 --> 01:13:31,117
<i>- One minute.</i>
- Let's just clear these houses from your beachfront view.

1137
01:13:32,619 --> 01:13:34,704
- Silver, the lever is broken!
- Broken?

1138
01:13:34,788 --> 01:13:38,041
Leonard, don't you have any gadgets you can use?
We're almost to the ramp.

1139
01:13:38,541 --> 01:13:40,877
Gadgets? Gadgets!

1140
01:13:40,961 --> 01:13:43,004
Forty-five seconds.

1141
01:13:43,088 --> 01:13:44,964
Attention, all personnel.

1142
01:13:45,048 --> 01:13:47,801
- Initiating launch sequence.
<i>- Initiating.</i>

1143
01:13:47,884 --> 01:13:50,178
Garry, any way you can bring me the gadgets?

1144
01:13:52,389 --> 01:13:54,557
No, there isn't.

1145
01:13:54,975 --> 01:13:57,519
<i>- Chuck, I need Garry's backpack.</i>
- On it.

1146
01:13:58,269 --> 01:14:00,271
Garry, where are you?!

1147
01:14:00,355 --> 01:14:01,690
Chuck, over here!

1148
01:14:08,822 --> 01:14:11,408
Yes! We've reached 65 miles per hour!

1149
01:14:11,491 --> 01:14:12,742
Fifteen seconds.

1150
01:14:13,201 --> 01:14:15,161
<i>- Fifteen, 14...</i>
- Let's do this!

1151
01:14:16,121 --> 01:14:18,790
<i>13, 12...</i>

1152
01:14:18,873 --> 01:14:20,208
<i>11...</i>

1153
01:14:20,292 --> 01:14:22,294
- Ten. Nine.
- Leonard, it's now or never.

1154
01:14:22,377 --> 01:14:24,504
- Oh, no.
- Got to raise that ramp!

1155
01:14:24,587 --> 01:14:26,506
Seven. Six.

1156
01:14:27,257 --> 01:14:28,842
Five.

1157
01:14:28,925 --> 01:14:30,969
Four. Three.

1158
01:14:31,803 --> 01:14:32,846
Two.

1159
01:14:32,929 --> 01:14:35,098
And one!

1160
01:14:35,181 --> 01:14:37,559
<i>There's an eagle nearby.</i>

1161
01:14:37,642 --> 01:14:39,811
<i>There's an eagle nearby.</i>

1162
01:14:39,894 --> 01:14:42,731
<i>There's an eagle nearby.</i>

1163
01:14:49,529 --> 01:14:53,491
No!

1164
01:14:58,913 --> 01:15:02,876
That's my sister!

1165
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:16,514
- It didn't work?
- I-- I don't get it.

1166
01:15:16,598 --> 01:15:18,642
Of course it didn't work.

1167
01:15:21,895 --> 01:15:27,484
You must really love your little islands,
to risk your lives trying to save them!

1168
01:15:28,818 --> 01:15:30,153
Well, guess what.

1169
01:15:30,236 --> 01:15:31,404
I don't care.

1170
01:15:31,488 --> 01:15:35,909
Because this right here is ice-cold, baby.

1171
01:15:38,203 --> 01:15:39,162
No!

1172
01:15:39,245 --> 01:15:40,580
- Zeta!
- What?

1173
01:15:40,664 --> 01:15:42,332
Wait!

1174
01:15:42,958 --> 01:15:44,876
- What? What...?
- Mighty Eagle!

1175
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:46,086
Yeah!

1176
01:15:53,051 --> 01:15:55,178
I'm the cause of all this.

1177
01:15:55,595 --> 01:15:58,682
I ran out on you on our wedding day.

1178
01:15:58,765 --> 01:16:02,686
And ever since then, you've been tormented inside.

1179
01:16:02,769 --> 01:16:04,854
Right now? This is when you choose to do this?

1180
01:16:04,938 --> 01:16:06,773
So take me!

1181
01:16:06,856 --> 01:16:08,525
Not these islands.

1182
01:16:09,442 --> 01:16:12,404
You have got some flipping nerve!

1183
01:16:12,487 --> 01:16:13,613
I know!

1184
01:16:13,697 --> 01:16:16,324
I ripped your heartstrings right out.

1185
01:16:16,408 --> 01:16:18,743
- That's it. Super String.
- What?

1186
01:16:18,827 --> 01:16:21,997
--Has been burning a hole in your sanity!

1187
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:24,457
- Set yourself free...
- Okay, I'm seeing it.

1188
01:16:24,874 --> 01:16:26,251
Yeah.

1189
01:16:26,334 --> 01:16:29,504
- Go ahead. Do your worst to me.
- Chuck.

1190
01:16:30,338 --> 01:16:31,339
I deserve it.

1191
01:16:33,550 --> 01:16:36,678
- You think this is about you, Ethan?
- Ethan?

1192
01:16:36,761 --> 01:16:40,473
Oh, that is so hilarious slash embarrassing

1193
01:16:40,557 --> 01:16:44,311
slash I hadn't thought about your fat butt in 20 years.

1194
01:16:44,394 --> 01:16:45,395
Wait, what?

1195
01:16:45,478 --> 01:16:50,025
You are a lazy, uncoordinated, fish-eyed fool.

1196
01:16:50,108 --> 01:16:52,444
You ain't worth the salt in your bread.

1197
01:16:52,527 --> 01:16:54,571
You are nothing to me! You are nothing!

1198
01:16:54,654 --> 01:16:57,657
I don't think about you at all.
I don't think about your stinking feet.

1199
01:16:57,741 --> 01:17:01,745
I don't think about your rusty hands.
I don't think about your rusty elbows--

1200
01:17:01,828 --> 01:17:04,414
Wait, so you have or you haven't thought about me?

1201
01:17:04,497 --> 01:17:05,915
News flash, bro:

1202
01:17:05,999 --> 01:17:08,585
I am over you, I'm over this place,

1203
01:17:08,668 --> 01:17:13,340
and I am ready to get that upgrade situation
going for me and my daughter.

1204
01:17:13,423 --> 01:17:14,674
Hey.

1205
01:17:16,051 --> 01:17:19,220
- Well, our daughter.
- What?

1206
01:17:24,017 --> 01:17:26,853
- That's my dad?
- I have a daughter?

1207
01:17:26,936 --> 01:17:28,688
Yes, you do!

1208
01:17:28,772 --> 01:17:32,942
And I raised her all by myself in this icy wasteland.

1209
01:17:33,026 --> 01:17:38,281
But now I'm gonna be sipping piña coladas
on those warm tropical islands

1210
01:17:38,365 --> 01:17:40,784
like I deserve to!

1211
01:17:43,953 --> 01:17:45,538
- Stop!
- Oh, no.

1212
01:17:54,506 --> 01:17:56,049
- Hey, it's working!
- Yes!

1213
01:17:58,510 --> 01:17:59,344
Oh, no.

1214
01:18:00,971 --> 01:18:02,097
Gotcha!

1215
01:18:07,602 --> 01:18:08,687
You can do it!

1216
01:18:08,770 --> 01:18:10,689
Hold on to that string!

1217
01:18:11,648 --> 01:18:12,607
The hatchlings.

1218
01:18:12,941 --> 01:18:14,734
Oh, no! They're in trouble!

1219
01:18:26,621 --> 01:18:27,455
Jump!

1220
01:18:33,420 --> 01:18:36,089
- Everyone, run!
- Run!

1221
01:18:36,172 --> 01:18:37,132
Let's go!

1222
01:18:37,215 --> 01:18:40,051
No, no, wait. This is not happening.

1223
01:18:47,225 --> 01:18:48,184
Gotcha!

1224
01:18:53,315 --> 01:18:55,608
- I'm freaking out!
- Me too!

1225
01:19:24,220 --> 01:19:25,597
- We did it.
- We did it.

1226
01:19:27,223 --> 01:19:28,058
Debbie?

1227
01:19:28,141 --> 01:19:30,185
Where is she? Where's Debbie?

1228
01:19:30,268 --> 01:19:31,686
Debbie?

1229
01:19:35,940 --> 01:19:37,359
Debbie, no.

1230
01:19:47,077 --> 01:19:48,870
What have I done?

1231
01:19:50,330 --> 01:19:52,248
Oh, Debbie.

1232
01:20:01,091 --> 01:20:02,425
Are you okay?

1233
01:20:04,010 --> 01:20:04,928
Sweetie?

1234
01:20:05,470 --> 01:20:06,763
Honey pie?

1235
01:20:06,846 --> 01:20:08,932
Love of the last one minute of my life?

1236
01:20:12,102 --> 01:20:13,269
Dad?

1237
01:20:13,728 --> 01:20:14,646
Yes.

1238
01:20:15,438 --> 01:20:17,899
You are so strong!

1239
01:20:17,983 --> 01:20:19,609
He saved my life!

1240
01:20:19,693 --> 01:20:21,194
Oh, Debbie.

1241
01:20:23,947 --> 01:20:26,199
Mom, can we keep him?

1242
01:20:26,282 --> 01:20:27,409
Please?

1243
01:20:27,492 --> 01:20:29,077
Oh, I...

1244
01:20:30,745 --> 01:20:32,080
Wait. Wait.

1245
01:20:32,163 --> 01:20:34,833
Before you answer, you should see something.

1246
01:20:34,749 --> 01:20:36,459
M.E. + ZETA

1247
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:38,378
Wait, wait, wait.

1248
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:44,384
And the one closest to my heart.

1249
01:20:47,929 --> 01:20:49,514
<i>I don't want to wait</i>

1250
01:20:50,098 --> 01:20:53,018
<i>For our lives to be over</i>

1251
01:20:53,101 --> 01:20:55,937
<i>Will it be yes or will it be</i>

1252
01:20:56,479 --> 01:20:59,024
<i>Sorry?</i>

1253
01:20:59,691 --> 01:21:00,567
Oh, no.

1254
01:21:06,197 --> 01:21:08,742
You are so pitiful.

1255
01:21:08,825 --> 01:21:09,993
<i>Yeah</i>

1256
01:21:10,994 --> 01:21:13,413
I've never been to a wedding before!

1257
01:21:13,496 --> 01:21:15,540
Oh, okay, who's getting married again?

1258
01:21:15,624 --> 01:21:18,877
Oh, Terence, this is like our wedding but expensive.

1259
01:21:20,045 --> 01:21:22,922
Flowers for you, flowers for you.

1260
01:21:23,006 --> 01:21:25,842
- Flowers for you.
- Ladies and gentlemen, birds and pigs,

1261
01:21:25,925 --> 01:21:29,929
we are gathered here today
because of these two characters.

1262
01:21:30,013 --> 01:21:33,350
Not only because they're being joined in holy matrimony,

1263
01:21:33,433 --> 01:21:38,897
but also because one of them tried to destroy our islands
for her own selfish reasons.

1264
01:21:38,980 --> 01:21:39,981
Guess who.

1265
01:21:40,065 --> 01:21:42,359
Oh, it's such a beautiful wedding.

1266
01:21:42,442 --> 01:21:43,735
It really is.

1267
01:21:43,818 --> 01:21:46,738
But Mighty Eagle swooped in at the last second

1268
01:21:46,821 --> 01:21:49,199
and got all the credit for stopping her.

1269
01:21:49,282 --> 01:21:50,784
Yes, you did, baby.

1270
01:21:50,867 --> 01:21:52,535
I love you.

1271
01:21:52,911 --> 01:21:54,037
Wrap it up.

1272
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:57,207
I now pronounce you eagle and husband.

1273
01:21:57,290 --> 01:21:59,960
- You may now kiss the...
- Come here, you.

1274
01:22:01,378 --> 01:22:04,631
All right. Get it, Mighty Eagle. Oh, that is disgusting!

1275
01:22:04,714 --> 01:22:06,925
Go, Zeta! Go, Dad!

1276
01:22:07,008 --> 01:22:08,343
Attention!

1277
01:22:08,426 --> 01:22:10,720
Attention, everybody. Eyes on me. Hi.

1278
01:22:10,804 --> 01:22:12,055
Hi. Look up here.

1279
01:22:12,138 --> 01:22:14,474
I would like to propose a toast

1280
01:22:14,557 --> 01:22:17,727
to the bird who made all of this possible.

1281
01:22:18,937 --> 01:22:21,231
Our hero, Red.

1282
01:22:21,314 --> 01:22:23,233
- Give it up for Red!
- Yeah!

1283
01:22:23,316 --> 01:22:26,069
<i>Red! Red! Red!</i>

1284
01:22:26,152 --> 01:22:27,737
You're our hero, Red!

1285
01:22:27,821 --> 01:22:29,072
<i>Red! Red! Red!</i>

1286
01:22:30,699 --> 01:22:33,284
Easy, guys. Hollow bones. I've got hollow bones.

1287
01:22:33,368 --> 01:22:35,078
- Who loves you, Red?
- Yeah, Red!

1288
01:22:36,037 --> 01:22:38,206
I mean, thanks, guys. I-- Thank you.

1289
01:22:39,291 --> 01:22:41,376
Speech, speech, speech!

1290
01:22:47,799 --> 01:22:49,926
Looks like they still love you, Red.

1291
01:22:52,178 --> 01:22:54,514
Okay, well, you know, I'm...

1292
01:22:54,597 --> 01:22:57,726
I'm honored, everybody. Really, I-- And I just...

1293
01:23:03,231 --> 01:23:06,359
Two seconds. Give me two seconds. I'll be right back.

1294
01:23:06,443 --> 01:23:08,987
Good speech! Yeah!

1295
01:23:09,070 --> 01:23:12,949
Excuse me. Excuse me. Pardon me.
Excuse me. I'm just trying to squeeze through here.

1296
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:15,910
Hey, hey, hey! Silver!

1297
01:23:24,586 --> 01:23:27,380
I... Thank you, guys.

1298
01:23:27,464 --> 01:23:30,258
Thank you for this. And for all the support and love.

1299
01:23:30,342 --> 01:23:33,595
You know, it means... Well, it means everything to me.

1300
01:23:33,678 --> 01:23:36,348
But I don't deserve it.

1301
01:23:37,057 --> 01:23:38,224
She does.

1302
01:23:38,308 --> 01:23:39,517
What just happened?

1303
01:23:39,601 --> 01:23:41,853
Is that the nerd from our physics class?

1304
01:23:42,270 --> 01:23:44,648
This is the real hero right here.

1305
01:23:44,731 --> 01:23:47,776
Silver is the one who came up
with the plan to stop the superweapon

1306
01:23:47,859 --> 01:23:51,237
and ultimately saved all our lives.

1307
01:23:52,280 --> 01:23:55,617
Red, I didn't do this all on my own.

1308
01:23:55,700 --> 01:23:58,244
Right. Because we're a team.

1309
01:23:59,788 --> 01:24:02,624
We couldn't have done anything without Chuck and Bomb,

1310
01:24:02,707 --> 01:24:05,210
- or Courtney and Garry.
- Thank you.

1311
01:24:05,293 --> 01:24:06,211
Or Leonard.

1312
01:24:06,294 --> 01:24:09,756
Actually, we probably could've done it without Leonard.
Let's be honest, huh?

1313
01:24:09,839 --> 01:24:12,842
Leonard's the man! I did everything! I got the sub!

1314
01:24:12,926 --> 01:24:14,844
And even Mighty Eagle.

1315
01:24:14,928 --> 01:24:15,971
- So handsome.
- Ethan!

1316
01:24:16,054 --> 01:24:20,141
And last, but certainly not least, those adorable hatchlings.

1317
01:24:21,685 --> 01:24:25,021
We are strongest when we all band together.

1318
01:24:25,105 --> 01:24:26,564
Just like Super String.

1319
01:24:26,648 --> 01:24:29,818
- Let's hear it for Silver!
- Yes!

1320
01:24:30,568 --> 01:24:32,529
I want to be an engineer.

1321
01:24:32,612 --> 01:24:35,281
- All right! Yeah, Silver!
- We love you, Silver!

1322
01:24:35,365 --> 01:24:37,492
- Okay, Garry, now.
- On it.

1323
01:24:40,495 --> 01:24:41,913
Oh, my gosh!

1324
01:24:41,997 --> 01:24:43,665
- We're famous!
- Look at that.

1325
01:24:43,748 --> 01:24:45,834
Oh, look! It's me!

1326
01:24:45,917 --> 01:24:48,628
You see, these guys are the real heroes.

1327
01:24:48,712 --> 01:24:52,007
They're the ones who deserve your love, not me.

1328
01:24:54,301 --> 01:24:56,219
We love you even more now, Red!

1329
01:24:56,303 --> 01:24:58,388
Yeah, Red! We love you!

1330
01:24:59,514 --> 01:25:02,058
See? You're not in this alone.

1331
01:25:02,142 --> 01:25:05,353
I'm married now. Let's party, y'all! I's married!

1332
01:25:13,695 --> 01:25:18,366
Debbie, get away from the punch bowl, girl!
Come over here and dance with your mama!

1333
01:25:24,831 --> 01:25:26,583
- Hey, y'all!
- Mom, watch this!

1334
01:25:26,666 --> 01:25:29,336
Oh, yeah! Hey, where's Red and Silver?

1335
01:25:32,589 --> 01:25:34,299
Okay, worms or birdseed?

1336
01:25:35,592 --> 01:25:37,844
Kidding. I know it's toast.

1337
01:25:37,927 --> 01:25:38,928
Toast.

1338
01:25:39,012 --> 01:25:42,557
I was actually being sarcastic
when I said that was my favorite food,

1339
01:25:42,641 --> 01:25:43,850
just for the record.

1340
01:25:43,933 --> 01:25:45,602
What? You?

1341
01:25:45,685 --> 01:25:47,062
Sarcastic?

1342
01:25:47,145 --> 01:25:48,855
- No way.
- I see what you're doing.

1343
01:25:48,938 --> 01:25:51,024
- Okay.
- Maybe you can teach me sometime.

1344
01:25:51,399 --> 01:25:53,777
Maybe I will, when you're not too busy saving the world.

1345
01:25:54,277 --> 01:25:58,698
You know, I actually just finished doing that,
so I'm pretty free.

1346
01:25:58,782 --> 01:26:01,284
Oh, no way. Because I'm pretty free too.

1347
01:26:01,368 --> 01:26:03,870
Well, I don't have anything to do either!

1348
01:26:03,953 --> 01:26:05,997
Wait a minute. What's that sound?

1349
01:26:06,081 --> 01:26:07,123
Tickle Train?

1350
01:26:07,207 --> 01:26:09,834
- Coming to Third Wheel Station!
- Chuck, no!

1351
01:26:09,918 --> 01:26:13,546
- Jinx, jinx, jinx!
- Jinx, jinx, jinx!

1352
01:26:29,229 --> 01:26:31,690
Laugh it up, everybody.

1353
01:26:33,775 --> 01:26:36,069
No one can stop me.

1354
01:26:36,152 --> 01:26:38,697
I'll stop you, Zeta.

1355
01:26:40,031 --> 01:26:42,117
Well, you can't stop me from...

1356
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:46,079
showing you how cute my little sisters are
when they're sleeping.

1357
01:27:00,385 --> 01:27:02,470
They're so cute.

1358
01:27:02,554 --> 01:27:05,307
I kind of thought they'd be hatched by now.

1359
01:27:07,017 --> 01:27:08,601
They're hatching!

1360
01:27:10,353 --> 01:27:11,313
Here they come!

1361
01:27:11,688 --> 01:27:13,606
Oh, my gosh! I see one!

1362
01:27:18,862 --> 01:27:19,821
Mama!

1363
01:27:39,549 --> 01:27:41,051
Can I help you?

1364
01:27:44,346 --> 01:27:45,555
Sorry.

1365
01:27:56,149 --> 01:27:57,108
Mama?

1366
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:03,239
Hi.

1367
01:28:04,282 --> 01:28:06,117
My baby sisters!

1368
01:28:14,084 --> 01:28:15,335
Bye.

1369
01:28:19,923 --> 01:28:21,007
Mama!

1370
01:28:22,676 --> 01:28:24,594
Oh, baby sisters.

1371
01:28:24,678 --> 01:28:27,973
- We love you so much.
- We should take good care of them

1372
01:28:28,056 --> 01:28:30,225
and never let them out of our sights.

1373
01:28:30,308 --> 01:28:33,687
Yeah. We'll never let them out of our sights.

1374
01:28:38,024 --> 01:28:39,317
Bye-bye.
