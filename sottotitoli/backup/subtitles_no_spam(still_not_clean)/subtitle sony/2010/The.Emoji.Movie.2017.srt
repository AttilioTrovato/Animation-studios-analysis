1
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,202
The world we live in.

2
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,210
It's so wondrous, mysterious,

3
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,001
even magical.

4
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,090
No. No, not that world.

5
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,931
I meant this one.

6
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,810
The smartphone.

7
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:49,081
Each system and program and app is its
own little planet of perfect technology,

8
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:54,611
all providing services so necessary,
so crucial, so unbelievably profound.

9
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,284
Look who just sent me a text.

10
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,361
Addie McAllister'?

11
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,166
Must be a mistake. Or a joke. Or a scam.

12
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,736
Don't send her your Social Security number.

13
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,841
Dude.

14
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,721
She's right there.

15
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,007
That's our user, Alex'

16
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,124
And, like every freshman in high school',

17
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,285
his whole life, everything,
revolves around his phone.

18
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,927
And, as the pace of life
gets faster and faster...

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,650
Phones down in five.

20
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,087
And attention spans
get shorter and shorter and...

21
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,162
You're probably not even
listening to me fight now.

22
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,687
Who has the time to type out actual words?

23
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,729
And that's where we come in,

24
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,690
the most important invention
in the history of communication...

25
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,565
Emojis.

26
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,726
That's my home.

27
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,725
Textopolis.

28
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,408
Here, each of us does one thing,

29
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,887
and we have to nail it every time.

30
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,888
The Christmas Tree
just has to stand there all festive.

31
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,280
Merry Christmas.

32
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,124
It's still September, Tim.

33
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,043
- The Princesses...
- I am so pretty.

34
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,646
They inst got to wear their crowns
and keep their hair combed,

35
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,210
You guys, we are so pretty.

36
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,409
Devil, Poop, Thumbs Up.

37
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,164
They just show up, and they're good to goo.

38
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,804
But for the faces, the pressure is on.

39
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,724
Crier always has to cry,
even if he's just won the lottery.

40
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,485
Hooray! I'm a billionaire!

41
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,289
The Laugher is always laughing,

42
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,124
even If he's just broken his arm.

43
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,364
I can see the bone!

44
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,641
Now, me, Tm a Meh.

45
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,691
"So I got to be totally over it all the
'time, you know, like, “Meh, who cares?"

46
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,643
Which is not as easy as it sounds'

47
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,046
I gotta be.

48
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,485
Meh

49
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,085
I gotta be.

50
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,606
Meh.

51
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,249
Morning, Mrs. D.
I see you have the little minis with you.

52
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,962
Theme as cum.

53
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,683
That is so adorable, I can't take it!

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,923
Now I'll never get them to sleep.

55
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,810
Stick to your one face, weirdo.

56
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,965
No! No!

57
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,566
It's hard to always act blasé,

58
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,849
when living in Textopolis
is just so exciting.

59
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,365
Hello, good simians.

60
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,727
Those are some sharp attachés.

61
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,003
Yes, well, we have business to attend to.

62
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,641
- What kind of business?
- Monkey business.

63
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,724
I sounded British.

64
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,648
Meh. That was really good.

65
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,207
Meh. Meh. That was a great...

66
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,930
- Whatcha doing there, mate?
- Practicing.

67
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,889
Today is my first day on the phone.

68
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,361
Boy. I'm gonna be so meh.

69
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,091
What are you gonna do?

70
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,925
Me and the boys
are gonna throw ourselves on the barbie!

71
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,645
Here's my sauce now.

72
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,041
G'day, mate.

73
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,484
Hey. Konnichiwa.

74
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,449
Sorry, emoticons.

75
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,280
I hate knocking over the elderly.
Here, let me help, let me help.

76
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,171
My colon!

77
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,930
- Is that the time?
- Hey, my eyes are up here, pal.

78
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,685
Yeah! All right!

79
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,810
Right on time.

80
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,167
So, last week,
Alex sends me next to this guy.

81
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,361
That kid. Where does he get this stuff?

82
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,367
Why are you laughing, freak?

83
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,642
Now, unlike me, my parents are total pros.

84
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,686
Gene, please tell me
you weren't laughing just now.

85
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,087
In public.

86
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,768
He was. I remember.

87
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,162
Let's go somewhere more private.

88
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,924
I have some bad news, Gene.

89
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,642
And I'm afraid you'll
have the wrong reaction.

90
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,246
Okay. What's the wrong reaction?

91
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,688
Anything other than "meh."

92
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,771
Come on. I don't want to be late.

93
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,609
I'm not letting you go to work today.

94
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,961
- Wait, what?
- You're just not ready, son.

95
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,409
Come on! Working in the cube
is an emoji's whole purpose in life.

96
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,922
Everybody my age is working
on the phone except for me.

97
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,125
Sweetie, that's not true.

98
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,684
Yeah! I'm gonna work on the phone,
and I'm only 10.

99
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,081
That's because I believe in you.

100
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,926
Should we wash our hands?

101
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,570
No, no, no.

102
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,640
We're number two! We're number two!
We're number two!

103
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,680
See?

104
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,929
I know I'm different, okay?

105
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,045
But when I need to, I can be meh.

106
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,200
I just...

107
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,761
I want to be a working emoji,
you know, like...

108
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,809
Like everybody else, and then...

109
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,008
Then I would finally fit in, you know?

110
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,084
You fit in, honey.

111
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,010
No, I don't, Mom.

112
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,641
I never have.

113
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,889
But I can change all that if you'd
just let me. Just give me a chance.

114
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,407
But what if you get sent out on the phone,
making the wrong face?

115
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,409
No, Dad, I'll make the right face.

116
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,960
Look.

117
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,169
Meh...

118
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,561
You're so handsome
when you make that face.

119
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,370
I think he's ready, Mel.

120
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,526
Meh.

121
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,641
Come on, Dad.

122
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,610
Let me prove it to you.

123
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,409
If you really think you're ready.

124
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,166
I am! Yes! Yes.
I promise, I won't let you down.

125
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,366
Stop.

126
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,806
Congratulations, everyone!

127
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,724
What an exciting day for all of you.

128
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,247
It's really her. Pizza.

129
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,651
- Hey.
- Your first day on the job.

130
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,326
Hi. Hi.

131
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,849
Don't be nervous. I won't bite.
Hi. I'm Smiler.

132
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,607
Don't touch me.

133
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,205
I mean, hey.

134
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,761
As you know, I'm Smiler.

135
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,161
I am the system supervisor here

136
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,641
because I was the original emoji.

137
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,045
Here's how it works.

138
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,326
It's nothing fancy.

139
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,887
Wait a minute. It's really fancy.

140
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,768
You each have
your own cube on the emoji bar.

141
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,729
If Alex chooses you,

142
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,043
should you be so lucky,
your cube will light up.

143
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,324
It's showtime.

144
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,403
The scanner will scan you,

145
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,962
and that scan will get sent
right up to Alex's text box.

146
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,725
And let me tell you, guys,

147
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,285
there is nothing like getting scanned
for the first time.

148
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,044
You're gonna love it. Really.

149
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,640
Now, over here is the favorites section

150
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,406
where you'll find all the
most popular emojis.

151
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,731
And, of course, you'll find my cube here.

152
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,880
You are smooth.

153
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,411
Just doing my duty.

154
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,889
What? What did I say?

155
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,730
Rocket looking to party.

156
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,366
Come on, tell me you aren't
just a little bit tempted.

157
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,125
Steven, for the last time,
I don't want to buy a time-share.

158
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,123
Come on, man, it's Hi-5.
You know me, I'm a favorite.

159
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,691
Alex hasn't picked you in weeks.

160
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,081
And if he stops picking you,
you're no longer a favorite.

161
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,685
It's got to be some son of mistake.

162
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,048
I mean, look at me, I'm an attractive hand
giving a high five.

163
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,481
- Fist Bump. Come on in.
- Hey.

164
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,202
- Ladies.
- Fist Bump? He's a Knucklehead. Literally.

165
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,169
Look at him. I can look like that.

166
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,891
Cramp. Huge mistake.

167
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,371
Help. Help me. Help up the hand.

168
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,887
- There you go.
- Thanks, mate.

169
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,404
Hey, little Meh, how about
you create a distraction,

170
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,244
and then I'll just slip under the rope?

171
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,690
Is someone lost?

172
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,844
Smiler, hi. Just leaving.

173
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,082
Yeah, you know, just killing time

174
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,766
before I go back to my
cube in the far corner

175
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,491
where Alex can't even see me anymore!

176
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,689
You may not be a favorite anymore,

177
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,684
but you will always have
a place in the cube.

178
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,331
Yeah, in the nosebleeds.

179
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,850
I'm standing right here. Words hurt.

180
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,164
The most important thing
I can tell you is to just be yourself.

181
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,521
I was made to be happy,
so I am always smiling.

182
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,729
Places, please. Emojis to your cubes'

183
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,601
Attention, We've got incoming.

184
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,010
Got to be meh. Got to be meh.

185
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,845
Oh, my gosh, my own cube.

186
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,931
I can't believe it.
I could put a plant over here.

187
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,566
And over here could go
an inspirational calendar.

188
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,446
Okay. Got to be meh. Got to be meh.

189
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,363
Look at our son down there.

190
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,041
I'm just beaming

191
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,565
with pride.

192
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,691
You don't think he'll actually get picked,
do you?

193
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,043
Hie-ro-gly-phics.

194
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,564
Hieroglyphics was an ancient language
of picture forms.

195
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,923
Does that remind anyone of anything?

196
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:45,129
Hello? A language of pictures. Anyone?

197
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,529
Early hieroglyphs date
back as far as 3300...

198
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,489
I got to reply to Addie's text.

199
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,564
- What should I write?
- Nothing.

200
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,644
- Nothing?
- Words aren't cool.

201
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,761
Okay. Be cool. Be cool.

202
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,370
All fight,
Alex is not sure how he wants to play this.

203
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,923
I would really love it to be me.

204
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,844
Beam me up! Beam me up!

205
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,770
I need Thumbs Up on standby.

206
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,571
Yeah! Thumbs Up is going in!

207
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,288
Wait! Alex is changing his mind.

208
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,891
He's moving.

209
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,969
Okay. Looks like it's gonna be Meh.

210
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:34,124
I'm so nervous, I could almost shrug.

211
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,965
We are go for Meh.

212
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,405
Initiating scan.

213
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,729
Okay. You can do this.

214
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,720
- I can't do this! I can't do it!
- What is this?

215
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,686
- Stop the scan!
- I can't! It's too late!

216
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,610
Meh, meh, meh, meh.
My goodness, I'm freaking out!

217
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,081
- What's he doing?
- He's making the wrong face!

218
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,931
Good for him! Little... Wait, what?

219
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,048
Be meh! Be meh! Be meh!

220
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,606
Abort! Abort!

221
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,404
Shut it down! Shut it down!

222
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,926
What is that emoji?

223
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,600
Wrong emoji sent! Evacuate the Meh cube!

224
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,566
- Evacuate the cube!
- I got to get out of here.

225
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,810
Get that bozo out of there!

226
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,245
I'm frying!

227
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,687
No!

228
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,601
Oh, my God.

229
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,565
The humanity.

230
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,129
Medic.

231
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,643
Sorry, everybody.
That was not what I meant to do.

232
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,041
I kinda...

233
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,566
I kinda panicked.

234
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,728
Are you even a Meh at all?

235
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,925
- Who? Me?
- Course he is.

236
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,405
He's my spitting image.

237
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,922
If you have expressions other than meh,

238
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,006
what you are is a malfunction.

239
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,087
Malfunction?

240
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,409
No! I can be meh.
Just give me one more chance.

241
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,448
That's not gonna happen.

242
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,203
You know what would be really fun?
Aboard meeting.

243
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,568
Where we could figure out
what to do with you!

244
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,360
- I knew there was something wrong with him.
- A malfunction?

245
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,656
- What's gonna happen to him?
- He can't work on the phone.

246
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,920
What would Alex think?

247
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,968
- That's the guy.
- What do his parents think?

248
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,808
I just wanted to be useful, you know?
Fit in.

249
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,331
Now everybody thinks I'm a malfunction.

250
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,564
I am a malfunction.

251
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,961
Even if you are a malfunction, Gene,

252
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,926
your mom and dad still love you.

253
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,850
I knew you weren't ready.

254
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,361
Let's gel you out of
here and take you home.

255
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,967
One day, all this will blow over,

256
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,727
and everyone will almost forget
about what you did.

257
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,687
Until then,

258
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,240
you should probably stay
locked up in the apartment.

259
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,327
Wait. You want to hide me away?

260
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,566
You're embarrassed of me.

261
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,564
It's for your own safety.

262
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,722
We're trying to protect you, son.

263
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,162
Gene? Where are you going?

264
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,896
I'm not gonna run away from this.

265
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,641
I'm an emoji, and even though
I'm not sure exactly which one,

266
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,487
I've got to have some sort of purpose here.

267
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,046
I know it.

268
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,969
Gene, no.

269
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,322
Sweetie, please.

270
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,281
Boy.

271
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,169
- A malfunction...
- Order! Order!

272
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,810
The motion is carried.

273
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,970
So, how'd it go, Gavel?

274
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,201
Hey, Light Bulb,
tell me what's going on in there.

275
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,443
What? Poop, what is it?

276
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,762
Tell me, turd. Tell me true. What happened?

277
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,686
I know it was an accident.
We all have accidents.

278
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,330
You're so soft, Poop.

279
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,050
Not too soft, I hope.

280
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,204
Gene!
We were just gonna come looking for you.

281
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:50,721
Why don't you come inside the boardroom,
and we can have a teeny, weeny chat.

282
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,451
I came up here to defend myself,
but you seem pretty happy.

283
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,970
So, good news?

284
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,281
Right. I'm always happy.

285
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,489
Right. Hashtag truth.

286
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,845
Well, the only thing
that could ever make me unhappy

287
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,164
is if one of our emoji team made a mistake,

288
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,362
which caused Alex to
lose faith in the phone.

289
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,842
And then our whole world gets wiped out.

290
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,561
Smiler, I double-pinky-swear promise to you

291
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:37,123
that I will never, ever
make a mistake in the cube again.

292
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,566
We know you won't, Gene.
We know you won't.

293
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:47,688
You know, the first time you said it, it
sounded genuine, but then you repeated it,

294
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,171
and then, that was weird.

295
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:53,484
That's because we're setting you up
with our best Anti-Virus Bots.

296
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,563
So, they'll like... They'll just...
They're gonna fix me'?

297
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,491
Actually, delete you. But yes!

298
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,803
- Wait, what?
- If you get deleted,

299
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,043
you don't have to worry about

300
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,803
what your purpose is or the future

301
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,487
or why you're such a malfunction.

302
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,884
'Cause you're deleted, right?

303
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,371
All right, good talk.

304
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,806
Bots!

305
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,286
No!

306
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,211
Don't let him escape!

307
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,368
Party time! Wait a minute...

308
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,727
The air is better here.

309
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,042
- Beer, Tea.
- I'm Coffee!

310
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,521
Sorry. Sheesh. So edgy.

311
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,324
My old cube.

312
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,969
Take a hike, Mike.

313
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,290
My name's not Mike. What?

314
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,283
- There's AV Bots coming!
- For me?

315
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,044
Just because I'm in the wrong section?

316
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,610
Holy deleto!

317
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,167
- What do we do?
- Quick! This way!

318
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,566
Let's go.

319
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,002
Don't tell anyone you're about to see this.

320
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,249
They'll never find us down here.

321
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,568
Where are we? The basement?

322
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,164
No. Welcome to the Loser Lounge,

323
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:13,007
where the emojis
who never get used hang out.

324
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,560
Go fish, Fish Cake With Swirl.

325
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,924
Sweep so you won't cry.
Sweep so you won't cry.

326
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,442
Sweep so you won't cry.

327
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,327
I almost got deleted.

328
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,404
Me, Hi-5.

329
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,130
Hey. What's up, Hi-5?

330
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,489
They weren't trying to delete you.
They were trying to delete me.

331
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,367
You? What's so important about you
they'd send out an entire team of Bots?

332
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,608
They say I'm a malfunction.

333
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,966
What?

334
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,410
You bringing malfunctions
in here now, Hi-5?

335
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,762
For crying out loud, Abandoned Luggage,

336
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,446
that had better not be
my leftover Chinese food.

337
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,804
What Chinese food?

338
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,686
Do you have any idea what it's like
to be living large, hashtag blessed,

339
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,846
the favorite of the favorites,
and then demoted to this pit of despair?

340
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,370
Here, will you hit my calluses for me?

341
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,285
At least you're a working emoji.

342
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,245
That's all I ever wanted.

343
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,328
Well, if that's all it'll take

344
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,768
for you to be satisfied, then just
find a hacker and get reprogrammed.

345
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,161
It's not that complicated.

346
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,686
Where would I find a hacker?

347
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,330
In the Piracy app.

348
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,845
Who took my clear nail polish?

349
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,641
Piracy app?

350
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,485
To get there, I mean,
I'd have to leave Textopolis.

351
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,848
So? I've done it. Would you be a brother?

352
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,246
One of the Princess emojis
left the phone altogether.

353
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,651
Now she lives on the cloud.

354
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,330
That is good.

355
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,444
I'm sure the hacker that helped her do that
could easily reprogram you.

356
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,403
- The name's Jailbreak.
- Jailbreak?

357
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,008
That's great! Reprogrammed.

358
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,445
I just need to be reprogrammed,

359
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,967
and then, I can finally be
the Meh I was meh to be.

360
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,522
Help me find that hacker, Hi-5.
Will you? Please?

361
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,683
Maybe this hacker could help you, too.

362
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,441
Like rewrite some code,
get you into the favorites section.

363
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,810
Wait a minute.

364
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,963
I've been trying to use my charisma

365
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,367
and sense of entitlement
to get me back on top,

366
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,930
but all I need is a hacker.

367
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,606
Today's your lucky day. Let's roll.

368
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,088
Hey, can I come, too?

369
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,924
Talk to the hand, Red Wagon.

370
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,730
I thought I was.

371
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,485
Bye, Felicia.

372
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,404
Ciao, Fish Cake with Swirl.

373
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:36,844
Daddy's heading back
to the VIPs where he belongs!

374
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,604
Wait. What about the Bots?

375
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,531
Good point. Good point.

376
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,967
Hey.

377
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,496
I shouldn't have picked the cactus.

378
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,456
- I just... I shouldn't have picked it.
- You didn't even try to get the tree.

379
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,130
It's baffling. Let's go.

380
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,886
Hi-5?

381
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,321
Hello?

382
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,286
Hi-5?

383
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,207
- Where are you?
- I'm right here!

384
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,969
Gene! Here we are, end of the text app.

385
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,006
No way.

386
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,569
Come on, Gene. It's perfectly safe.

387
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,365
- No!
- Gene, help me!

388
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,576
- The wallpaper monster's got me!
- No! Hold on, hold on!

389
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,806
Hi-5!

390
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,527
No. This is all my fault!
I'm so sorry, Hi-5! I'm...

391
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,329
I'm just messing with you.

392
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,416
It's one of those
rubber finger-monster puppets

393
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,920
from the '80s. I collected the whole set.

394
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,441
All right, you coming?

395
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,800
- What do I do?
- What do you mean?

396
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,569
Just take a step through the other side.

397
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,047
This is it.

398
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,963
The next time I come back here,

399
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,649
I'll be a real Meh.

400
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,841
Hi-5?

401
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,326
No!

402
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,291
Are you finished?

403
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,444
Where are we?

404
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,569
Welcome to the Wallpaper.

405
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,684
This place is incredible.

406
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,042
Each app is its own unique world.

407
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,888
That's my face. You're on my... Thank you.

408
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,810
What is this place?

409
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,200
WeChat.

410
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,042
It's like a whole other world.

411
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,006
It is.

412
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,087
What are they'?

413
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:18,369
They're Bubble Pups. They might be cute,
but, man, are they clingy.

414
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,681
- Bubble Pups?
- They're stickers, Gene.

415
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,370
Try to get with the program.

416
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,485
This is so cool.

417
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,404
Wait. What's in that one?

418
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,576
- Guys, look at this picture. Look at my baby.
- This is what I ate for breakfast.

419
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,056
- This is what I ate for lunch!
- Here's me on a hike!

420
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,656
Here's me in the gym!
Here's me in the bathroom!

421
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,762
Everybody's talking about themselves.

422
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,526
How does he know so many people?

423
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,490
None of these people know him,
but they like him,

424
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,530
and that's what matters
in this life, popularity.

425
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,564
I think I'd...

426
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,682
I think I'd rather just have a real friend.

427
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,241
A real friend?
How's that gonna get you anywhere?

428
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,562
What you need are fans.

429
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:58,288
They give you complete
and unrelenting support.

430
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,250
As long as you're on top.

431
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,645
Poor Gene. I blame myself.

432
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,450
I blame you, too.

433
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,601
I just wanted to be supportive.

434
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,489
You just wanted a vacation.

435
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,808
You take that back, Mel Meh.

436
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,481
Bots.

437
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,843
If they haven't found Gene by now,
he must have skipped town.

438
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,331
You mean the Wallpaper?

439
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,044
Our boy's on the run.

440
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,964
How about we find him ourselves?

441
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,725
Yeah, for sure.

442
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,368
Tell all Bots to follow those Mehs.

443
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,884
I'm sure they'll know all the
freaky-deaky apps Gene will hide out in.

444
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,640
I'm really good at making plans, you guys.

445
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,167
Right?

446
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,568
Here we are. The Piracy app.

447
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,768
This is where we'll find Jailbreak.

448
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,723
But this is the Dictionary.

449
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,201
That's just what Alex
wants his parents to think.

450
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,890
This is called a skin.

451
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,925
Really? What could a teenage boy
possibly want to hide from his parents?

452
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,331
Just try to keep up.
This place can gel a little rough.

453
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,930
Ahoy, mateys.

454
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,805
Look who's back!

455
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,201
Hi-5!

456
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,687
I'm a bit of a celebrity here.
Always welcome.

457
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,281
Loser!

458
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,125
Come on. Follow me.

459
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,525
Great. Emojis.

460
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,286
I thought the conversation just got dumber.

461
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,569
Internet trolls. Just ignore them.

462
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,523
Eventually, they'll get
a job or a girlfriend

463
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,365
"or some sort of purpose in life,
and they" stop.

464
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,611
Virus. We'll just...
We'll just walk over this way.

465
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,570
- Hi! It's so great to see you again.
- Do I know you?

466
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,968
It's Spam. Just sign here and I can get you
special discounts on vitamins

467
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,776
and credit card offers
that can save you up to 25%.

468
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,451
- 25%?
- No, no, no, don't get sucked in.

469
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,846
Back off, Spam!

470
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,649
It's the only way to deal... Back off!

471
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,165
Thank you very much!

472
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,130
You can illegally download
our CD right here.

473
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,562
Hey, Trojan Horse. How are you?

474
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,370
Yeah, what'll it be, hand?

475
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,728
I'll have a bottle of "Hack Daniel's."

476
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,564
Maybe with a plate of cheese and hackers?

477
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,482
- Capisce?
- You trying to find a hacker'?

478
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,405
- You can just ask, you know.
- Sorry. Yes.

479
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,289
We're looking for a hacker named Jailbreak.

480
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,410
I know a guy that can hook you up.

481
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,251
Right over there.

482
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,729
He looks capable.

483
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,851
No, not him. Her.

484
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,924
Wait. He's a she?

485
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,365
Hey, Jailbreak.

486
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,363
- Mind if we join you?
- Yes.

487
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,816
That's the thing about
the Internet, isn't it?

488
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,286
You can never tell if someone's
being ironic or sincere.

489
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,370
I sincerely, unironically
want you to go away.

490
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,371
That's a good one.

491
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:11,124
So, here's the thing.
My friend Gene here has a little problem.

492
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,680
Well, see, I'm supposed to be a Meh,

493
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,616
- but I don't really feel...
- Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

494
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,644
No, that's good. And we thought
you could help, since you got the Princess,

495
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,802
- you know, off the phone.
- Not interested.

496
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,851
Hold up. That's not a Meh face.

497
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,610
Bots! They're after me!

498
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,400
How are you doing that?

499
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,608
Look, it's just something I can do.
Can you help us?

500
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,961
Follow me.

501
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,411
Bots! Delete my history!

502
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,726
I corrupted the entire hard drive.

503
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,284
I made the most delicious cinnamon buns.

504
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,287
Maybe if there was something
to, you know, jog my memory.

505
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,924
Come on! Move!

506
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:15,367
Hey, Trolls, why is that mailbox
wearing a tuxedo?

507
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,046
Hi! It's so great to see you again!
Call me!

508
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,090
This tunnel will get us out of here.

509
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,281
Move!

510
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,643
Did that cloud taste sweet to you?

511
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,244
Help me! Help! I'm stuck!

512
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,411
- Sweet motherboard!
- Where am I?

513
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,321
- Get me out of here.
- Hey, Palm Face.

514
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,966
- Try getting him out the top!
- Already on it!

515
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,445
Hold tight, Gene.

516
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,882
This feels very odd, and it smells.

517
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,487
I mean, it smells good, it smells
delicious, but I still don't like it.

518
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,842
The game obviously thinks you're a candy,

519
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,083
even though you're weirdly misshapen,
you know?

520
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,766
What are we gonna do?

521
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,524
Stay very still.

522
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,127
Don't worry. We've got your back.
Right, Hi-5?

523
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,531
Hey, Fingers! You want to focus?

524
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,816
For your information, I happen
to have a sugar addiction,

525
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:57,320
- and it's a very serious...
- Listen, Finger Head!

526
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:01,167
We have to get Gene out of the game
without blowing him up.

527
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,240
I don't want to blow up.

528
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,568
We have to match up the candies,
so that Gene will drop to the bottom.

529
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,723
And we can't match him
with any yellows, or else...

530
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,416
Don't do that. Please don't do that.

531
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,646
Watch.

532
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,130
- You got it?
- Match three in a row.

533
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,645
Don't blow Gene up. Got it.

534
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,484
And we have to be very careful.

535
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:23,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Careful. Candy!

536
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,011
- Watch it!
- Hey!

537
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,125
No! No, no, no! Slow down.

538
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,009
Not the yellows! Not the yellows.

539
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,805
I said careful!

540
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:43,450
My mom just joined Facebook.
Can you believe she wanted to friend me?

541
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,327
Hey, Addie, I was just
wondering if you are...

542
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,606
- Tasty.
- What?

543
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,042
Delicious.
- Excuse me?

544
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,121
Sweet.

545
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,725
- Hey, Addie!
- Hi, Nikki.

546
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,763
- No!
- See you later, Alex.

547
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,765
Sugar Crush.

548
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,366
So over this.

549
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,604
Wireless Wireless. How may I help you?

550
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,170
I'd like to make an appointment.

551
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,120
It's like this phone is
playing games with me.

552
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,530
Hey, what does this do?

553
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,320
No!

554
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,360
Get me out of here!

555
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:31,410
- Suck it in!
- No! Stop it! Stop, stop!

556
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:35,010
- It's not working.
- Well, there's one option left.

557
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,085
We line you up with the yellows.

558
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,600
But you said not to do that.

559
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,047
Special candies get
transported to that jar.

560
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,602
The game might think
you're a special candy.

561
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:47,202
And what if it doesn't think
I'm a special candy?

562
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,600
Well...

563
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,931
Jailbreak, hello? Hello, Jailbreak?
- Sorry.

564
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,160
What if it doesn't think
I'm a special candy?

565
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,649
I'm not too worried about it.

566
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,484
Okay, just do it.

567
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,360
Gene!

568
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,603
- Gene?
- Hey. No!

569
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,447
Gene! You're alive!

570
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,521
You were trying to see if I had somehow
turned into candy, weren't you?

571
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,648
Yes, I was. And you have not.

572
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,331
Hey. Looks like something popped up
on Alex's calendar.

573
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,121
I'm sure it's nothing.

574
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,162
Alex made an appointment
at the phone store.

575
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,441
No!

576
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,962
Calm down, everyone!

577
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,411
Calm down.

578
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,967
Don't worry. Everything is fine.

579
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,640
Maybe Alex just wants
to buy some accessories.

580
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,323
His appointment is with technical support.

581
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:07,926
Well, I'm sure we still have plenty of time
to figure this out.

582
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,648
His appointment is for tomorrow.

583
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,605
Then maybe it's just
for some routine maintenance.

584
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,641
Actually, it's to erase the phone.

585
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:29,565
Listen, Gene, I'm about to become
your knight in shining armor.

586
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,244
- You are?
- Yeah.

587
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,447
But first,
we need to get uploaded to the cloud.

588
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,844
That's where we'll find the source code
to reprogram you.

589
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,491
The cloud?

590
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,170
Isn't that off the phone?

591
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,089
Ding, ding, ding, ding. You got it.

592
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,682
Yeah, the cloud. Off the phone.

593
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,770
We're in Candy Crush, obvs.

594
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,328
I know a shortcut to Just Dance,

595
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,090
which is right next to Dropbox,

596
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,162
where we can get uploaded to the cloud.

597
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,896
Of course.
Just Dance, then boogie over to Dropbox,

598
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,331
catch the link, and zoom.

599
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,811
Hold up. Here's the stinker.

600
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,566
Before they let us into the cloud,
we have to get past this firewall.

601
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:09,648
- The firewall uses face identification.
- Yeah, the firewall.

602
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,136
Which is really annoying,
because I've already tried to get through.

603
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,447
Guessed wrong once,
and now I'm locked out for life.

604
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,601
Locked out for life?

605
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,764
You're thinking,
'cause I can make different faces,

606
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,361
- the firewall will think I'm different emojis.
- Yeah.

607
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,887
I wanted to say it 'cause it was my idea.

608
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,816
You know, women are always
coming up with stuff

609
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,056
that men are taking credit for.

610
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:30,084
- You know what...
- Well, then let's hit the road.

611
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,531
Hi-5, you coming?

612
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,204
I'm coming!

613
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,610
Why do I always think
I'm gonna come around on black licorice?

614
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,806
My precious.

615
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,211
Hey! Move it!

616
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,964
Certain death, here we come.

617
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,010
Let's try this one.

618
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,210
YouTube?

619
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,568
What a visual treat.

620
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,928
And I don't even need a remote.

621
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,088
That guy is so expressive.

622
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,568
He reminds me of Gene.

623
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,485
Yeah. Something really wrong with him.

624
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,411
- Mel.
- Our son is a malfunction,

625
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,890
and you should never have
let him go into that cube.

626
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,849
Don't blame me for this, Mel.

627
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,002
I am hopping mad at you.

628
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,361
See?

629
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,441
Mary, I think we're being followed.

630
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,484
But don't overreact.

631
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,771
I told you not to overreact.

632
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,405
What are you doing now?

633
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,287
They'll be in there for hours.

634
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,324
Mary, where are you going?

635
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,807
I think we should go our
separate ways, Mel.

636
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,651
I thought I knew the Meh that I married,

637
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,484
but maybe I don't.

638
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,650
But, Mary...

639
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,327
This tunnel will help us avoid the Bots.

640
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,246
Thanks for helping us.
It's really nice of you.

641
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:24,005
NBD, dude. The truth is, you're helping me.

642
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,809
Come on, let's move it. Why so slow?

643
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:29,202
Hi-5, stop. Why are you getting so close?
What's with you? Back off.

644
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,009
Can't stop now. I'm having a sugar rush!

645
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:34,483
I'll go around you.
If I stop moving, my heart's gonna explode!

646
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:38,241
- Coming through, Jailbreak! Look out!
- Hey! Watch it, Knuckle Butt!

647
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,840
I can't feel my face.

648
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:43,330
So, Jailbreak,
back there you said I'm helping you.

649
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:46,006
I've been trying to
get past that firewall for months.

650
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:49,000
Come on, come on! The faster we get there,
the faster I become a favorite!

651
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,690
Look at me!

652
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,441
I just want to bounce out of here,
get off the phone, and live on the cloud.

653
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,005
What just happened?

654
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,923
You don't like it here?

655
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:08,482
There's so many rules here.
What is up with that?

656
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,205
The cloud is supposed to be amazing.

657
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,930
There's so much to see and do.

658
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,891
Sugar crash.

659
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,201
I can't hold on anymore.

660
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,884
Catch me, Gene. Catch me!

661
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,802
And you can be whoever you want.

662
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,964
- Thanks.
- You're free! Come on!

663
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,042
Oh, my gosh, my hands are sweating.

664
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,480
You are a hand!

665
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,686
Yeah!

666
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,161
You know, come to think of it,
I don't really remember

667
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,402
there ever being a hacker emoji.

668
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:48,530
You know, you're taking up
too much of my brain space.

669
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,409
Let's keep the chitchat to a minimum.

670
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,924
- Someone likes you.
- What are you talking about?

671
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,010
This is just like when Peace Sign
gave me just one finger.

672
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,725
I knew she was in love with me.

673
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,245
Let's go!

674
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,731
I'm never eating
another piece of candy ever again.

675
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,770
Hi-5, don't do it.

676
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:12,451
Don't you do it.
It's already been in there once.

677
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,445
Don't do it.

678
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,762
- Move it!
- Are my fingers getting fat?

679
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,201
I'll tell you what,
this bandage wasn't so tight before.

680
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:31,325
Okay. We get through this app,
and Dropbox is right on the other side.

681
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,046
We just need to keep it super DL in here.

682
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,642
And no matter what, we can't tum it on.

683
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,281
OMG, this turned it on!

684
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:48,530
What? I'm a hand. It's a big, red button.

685
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,200
- What's happening?
- No, no, no, no, no!

686
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,568
Welcome to Just Dance!

687
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:11,089
Follow my moves
and you get to move forward.

688
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,444
Do the wrong moves and you get an "X."

689
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,247
Three strikes and you're out.

690
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,122
Out? What does she mean by "Out"?

691
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,010
Digital death.

692
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,883
Thanks to you, Fingers.
Now we're gonna have to dance our way out.

693
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:29,443
Which is all right with me,
'cause I can shake it like Michael.

694
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,011
Or Michael's glove, anyway.

695
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:35,762
Are you ready to dance?

696
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,522
This is bad, Gene. I can't dance.
I got no groove.

697
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,729
Come on. Everybody can dance.

698
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:45,169
Not me, okay? I'm really stiff.

699
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:49,003
See? I can't... Don't understand.

700
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,526
Okay. No, no.

701
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,456
- Hey, no, stop, stop.
- Stop, stop. She has to stop.

702
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,643
I see now what you are saying.
Just follow her moves.

703
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,728
Ready to dance in three...

704
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,600
This I can't do.

705
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,525
- Two...
- Dude...

706
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,529
- Just shut up and...
- Dance!

707
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:20,405
It's too easy! Shamone!

708
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,081
Jailbreak!

709
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,045
I got you.

710
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,603
Look. Just feel the music.

711
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,921
- Express yourself.
- Through dance?

712
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,250
Yeah, you got m Go, girl!

713
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,567
Now throw some sauce on that dance burrito.

714
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,931
I'm doing it!

715
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,407
I'm fully nailing this dance!

716
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,405
You got it!

717
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:11,363
Great job! You're moving on to free dance!

718
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:14,689
Impress us with your moves to move forward.

719
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,490
More dancing?

720
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,531
You're killing it, Gene! Slay!

721
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,809
Nice! Shake it, Gene. You won't break it.

722
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,371
Wait a minute!

723
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,647
I've never seen that dance before.

724
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,767
What's it called?

725
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,567
The Emoji Pop?

726
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,890
I love it!

727
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,610
What? You do?

728
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:02,005
Everybody, do the Emoji Pop!

729
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,005
Yes!

730
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,810
Princess.

731
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,484
You're the Princess emoji?

732
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:33,841
You never got off the phone.

733
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,048
Welcome, new players!

734
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:37,681
- What?
- Who?

735
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:38,961
No!

736
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,929
- We got to go.
- Don't worry.

737
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:50,281
They're robots. They can't dance.

738
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,882
Downloading funk protocol.

739
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,650
"Can't dance," he says.

740
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,326
Move!

741
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,244
Congratulations. You're a disco diva.

742
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,368
Hey, Alex, you gonna dance for us?

743
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,402
Alex, that's extra homework for you.

744
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,450
Hey, Alex, you gonna shake it?

745
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,604
No! No, no, no, no, no, no!

746
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,170
Alex must be deleting the app.

747
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:37,885
Watch out!

748
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,528
- No!
- We got to get out of here.

749
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:45,931
Come on!

750
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:47,971
This song is my jam.

751
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:50,082
Hi-5, come on! Let's go!

752
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,531
Hurry!

753
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,325
- Hi-5!
- Gene!

754
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:07,805
I got you!

755
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,800
Gene...

756
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,561
Hi-5!

757
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,321
Gene.

758
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:38,371
Hey, wait. Where's Hi-5?

759
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,009
Alex trashed the app.

760
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,009
And Hi-5 right along with it.

761
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,004
Wait, what? Wait, trashed?

762
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,491
Hi-5 is in the trash?

763
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,485
He wanted to dance.

764
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,160
But I knew it was a bad idea.

765
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,887
- I'm so sorry.
- We got to get him out of there.

766
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:59,205
Gene, Dropbox is right here.
That's our ticket to the cloud.

767
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,001
And the trash is on
the other side of the phone.

768
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:04,128
We don't know how many
other Bots are out there.

769
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:08,009
- I'm sorry.
- No way. We can't go without Hi-5.

770
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,164
I don't care how faraway it is.

771
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:13,243
- Gene.
- That's my friend down there.

772
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:15,403
I'm not just gonna leave
him to get deleted.

773
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,171
What? What is it?

774
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:23,082
I've always just thought
you got to look out for number one.

775
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,204
Well, what good is it to be number one
if there aren't any other numbers?

776
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,805
Okay.

777
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:34,211
I'm sorry. This is my malfunction.

778
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,971
I just... I can't be meh about anything.

779
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:39,208
This is why I'm going to get reprogrammed.

780
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:43,450
Well, it's actually kind of cool.

781
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:45,564
Wait, really?

782
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,571
You know, I think I know a shortcut.

783
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,168
We can take the music streams in Spotify.

784
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,649
Let's go give that big hand a hand.

785
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:58,241
Come on.

786
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:11,449
Alex trashed the Just Dance app,
and our Bots are offline,

787
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,249
and it's giving me a real headache.

788
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:15,609
I am so angry.

789
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,764
I really need to stay happy.

790
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,445
Can we please lighten the mood?

791
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,841
No one can resist una fiesta!

792
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:27,920
Not that happy.

793
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:33,010
We've only got four hours
before Alex's phone appointment.

794
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:36,681
If they find a malfunction on the phone,
we are all gonna be wiped.

795
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:38,321
Yeah.

796
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:40,490
She said, "Wiped."

797
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,364
Aim higher, Steven.

798
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,649
I didn't want to have to do this,
but it is fun to press buttons.

799
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,280
The illegal upgrade.

800
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,883
Now that makes me happy.

801
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:11,084
I just want to dance.

802
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,089
Dance, please.

803
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,964
Quiet, you sassy gypsy-

804
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:22,486
- Where am I?
- Hi! It's so great to see you again!

805
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,927
You're in the trash, Fingers for Brains.

806
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,729
- Get away from me, Troll.
- Hi!

807
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,251
It's so great to see you again!

808
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:30,163
- I got to get out of here.
- You can't.

809
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,605
And at the end of the day,

810
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:34,690
the trash gets emptied,
and we're all gonna die!

811
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:36,205
No. No, no!

812
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:39,091
This is the last face you will ever see.

813
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,367
No!

814
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,042
- This is Spotify?
- Yep.

815
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,521
Every one of those streams
is a different song.

816
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,365
Is it safe?

817
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,081
Yeah!

818
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:17,282
- Yeah!
- Are you sure this is a good idea?

819
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:19,362
Fastest way to the trash, dude!

820
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,330
Could we at least pick a calmer stream?

821
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,050
Okay, buzzkill.

822
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:33,245
Alex. A bunch of people
are hitting the promenade.

823
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:36,164
- I think Addie might be there, too.
- That's perfect!

824
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:39,200
I have an appointment down there, anyway.
I've got to get this phone fixed.

825
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:40,480
Bubble, bubble, bubble butt.

826
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,722
- Hey, bubble butt.
- Yeah, you do.

827
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:47,605
Much better.

828
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:49,650
So, I got to ask.

829
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,891
Is it true that when a princess whistles,
birds fly down from the skies, and...

830
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:57,089
Hello, stereotype.
That is a complete and total myth.

831
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:58,766
I'm sorry.

832
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:02,503
Did you realize that on
the first emoji set,

833
00:50:02,528 --> 00:50:05,110
a woman can either be a
princess or a bride?

834
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:09,491
That's why I need to get to the cloud,
where you can be whoever you want to be.

835
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,162
Gel ready. Whale song coming.

836
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,402
- Wait, wait. Whale what?
- A whale song.

837
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,767
From Alex's biology presentation.

838
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:30,771
You're not gonna see that
sitting around in a cube.

839
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,602
It's funny.
You want out of the cube, and I want in.

840
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:41,968
Gene, if that means you can't be yourself,
what's the point?

841
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:47,001
You know, I think you're pretty cool
just the way you are.

842
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,647
We're gonna need this.

843
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:11,167
Nobody knows
the touchscreens I've seen.

844
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:15,049
Nobody knows my screenshots.

845
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:19,525
In the trash? Me? I used to be somebody.

846
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:23,323
Here I am. Look.
In an old e-mail Alex never sent.

847
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:25,563
"Addie..."

848
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,084
And then there's me, Hi-5,

849
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:31,288
right there, doing my job.

850
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:36,369
FYI, nobody cares about you.

851
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:40,207
Just leave me, Troll, and let me die

852
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:43,047
in this dump alone.

853
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:46,171
Let me look for the world's
smallest violin in here,

854
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:47,651
so you can play it.

855
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:53,489
It's the Hand Angel of Mercy.
She's finally come for me.

856
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,361
Give me your hand!

857
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,010
I mean, give me yourself.

858
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,009
Take my hand, angel.

859
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:04,881
I'm ready to take my place
amongst the other great hands of the past.

860
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:07,122
- It's me, Gene!
- Gene?

861
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,645
The one and only.

862
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:10,728
- Gene!
- I got him!

863
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:15,405
Take me with you.

864
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:18,611
- Hi-5!
- Let go of me.

865
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:20,125
Don't leave me down here!

866
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:24,930
You were wrong, Troll.
People do care about me.

867
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,490
And I'm not upset, Troll.

868
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:29,291
Do you see how not upset I am?

869
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:34,449
Gene, you came back for me.

870
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:36,490
You saved me.

871
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,568
It wasn't just me. Jailbreak helped, too.

872
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,564
And she's a hugger. Give her a squeeze.

873
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,001
No, no, no.

874
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:47,007
There really is nothing greater
than the feeling of being truly free.

875
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:54,921
You filthy trolls, I inhaled your stench,

876
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:58,210
but I was once one of you,
so I, too, feel your pain.

877
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:00,762
Now go. Be free!

878
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:03,923
Should be smooth sailing from here.

879
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:17,130
Gene.

880
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:22,200
Gene.

881
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:28,601
Gene?

882
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,849
Are you Instagramming?

883
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:42,008
Where is my Gene?

884
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:10,681
Mary.

885
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:13,242
You've really done it this time.

886
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:16,641
- No, you haven't.
- Mel?

887
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,129
What are you doing
in Alex's trip to France album?

888
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,164
I was looking for you.

889
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:24,687
None of this is your fault, Mary.

890
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,086
It's mine.

891
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,324
What do you mean?

892
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:36,241
Is that a tear on your cheek?

893
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,722
It's my fault Gene is the way he is.

894
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,409
I have other expressions, too.

895
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:43,722
I think they've just been buried away.

896
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:49,008
But with Gene going missing
and thinking I might have lost you, too...

897
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:52,364
Mel. Why didn't you tell me?

898
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,043
I didn't know myself.

899
00:54:55,960 --> 00:55:01,046
Right now, I'm so overwhelmed
with passionate feelings for you.

900
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:10,566
Mary, my love for you burns
with the intensity

901
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,244
of a red-hot flame.

902
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:14,649
I like that, Mel.

903
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:18,729
Let's go find our son.

904
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,246
Together.

905
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:26,921
We'll always have Paris, Mary.

906
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:33,689
So, you're a princess.

907
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:36,331
I saw your little tiara. Very fancy.

908
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,687
Is it true when a princess whistles,

909
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:40,560
- birds fly down from...
- That's what I said!

910
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:43,001
No, guys! That's a stupid myth!

911
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:45,765
What software version are we living in?

912
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:47,211
Go read an e-book.

913
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:48,731
- Jailbreak...
- Educate yourselves.

914
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,723
- Just look behind you.
- What the...

915
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,201
What is that?

916
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:56,248
Smiler must have upgraded her Bots.

917
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:57,416
Let's get out of here before it...

918
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:59,761
Hi, Gene. Remember me? Smiler.

919
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:02,366
I'm coming to you five
from the amphitheater.

920
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:06,968
Why don't you come back to Textopolis and
we can talk through our differences, okay?

921
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:11,808
My friend here win' escort you, of! Right?
I'm gonna see you soon, buddy. Bye, now.

922
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:15,206
We're actually gonna delete him
in front of everyone.

923
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:17,330
- Il's still on!
- It's still what?

924
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,364
Jiminy Sassafras!

925
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:22,641
Move!

926
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:32,125
Separate!

927
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,131
Tangle him up!

928
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:59,206
Jailbreak!
- Gene! This way!

929
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:00,645
- It's still after me!
- Over here!

930
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,040
Let's go.

931
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:14,930
We have to make it to Dropbox.

932
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:20,887
Yes!
'Yes!

933
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,243
- No!
- Go low!

934
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,565
Don't worry. It can't get in.

935
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:37,201
It's illegal malware,
and this app is secure.

936
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,011
Come on.

937
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,969
Welcome to Dropbox.
You are about to leave the phone.

938
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,929
Remain seated, please.

939
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:52,890
You might want to hang on.

940
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:55,488
Why do they call this Dropbox, anyway?

941
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:57,642
This is why! I see that now!

942
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:01,881
Yeah!

943
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,487
I think we're about to see
that candy com again!

944
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:15,125
We made it.

945
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:19,041
Guys, guys, chill.
We still have to get past that.

946
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:30,844
- Holy...
- Yeah.

947
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:32,690
Hello.

948
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:34,730
Welcome to the firewall.

949
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,325
How may I help you?

950
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,289
- All right, here goes.
- What do I do?

951
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:40,601
Sit in the corner and don't say a word.

952
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:42,808
Keep those sausage fingers to yourself.

953
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:45,087
Yes, Your Majesty Princess of Nightmares!

954
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:49,404
Now, Gene, step onto the password icon,
and I'll feed you the passwords.

955
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:50,481
Okay.

956
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:57,164
Okay. 10-11-2002.

957
00:58:57,240 --> 00:59:00,244
10-11-2002.

958

Access denied.

959
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:08,043
Okay, try a different expression.

960
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:10,327
Is it gonna blast me every time I mess up?

961
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:11,885
Yeah, kinda.

962
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:13,371
What do you mean, "Kinda"?

963
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:14,851
Ready?

964
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:17,327
Welcome to the firewall.

965
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:19,721
His favorite food. Chimichangas.

966
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:20,961
Chimichangas?

967
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:25,371
Access denied.

968
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:28,241
This might take a while.

969
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:29,931
On, boy.

970
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,809
Krav Maga.

971
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:34,123
Krav Maga.

972
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:35,929
- Major Lazer.
- Major Lazer.

973
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,001
Abuela Dora!

974
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:40,085
Skate or die.

975
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:42,250
Access denied.

976
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:44,163
Denied.

977
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,246
I don't get it.

978
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:55,085
We've tried all the important things
in Alex's life.

979
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:58,846
His favorite pet, sport,
his favorite grandma.

980
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:00,891
I'm sorry, Gene.

981
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:02,689
I let us all down.

982
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:07,889
You know, if I had to
come up with a password,

983
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,287
I'd probably use the
name of a girl I liked.

984
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:12,044
I've been all over the phone.

985
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:13,770
He's never mentioned a girl.

986
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:15,731
Yes, he has.

987
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:20,125
Hi. When I was in the trash,
I read a very interesting e-mail,

988
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:23,921
but I'm just the dunce in the corner,
forbidden to speak.

989
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:26,123
- What e-mail?
- Sorry, what?

990
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:27,281
What e-mail?

991
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:28,771
To a girl at school.

992
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:30,336
He was declaring his
feelings of love for her.

993
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:33,887
I guess instead of sending it,
he tossed it in the trash.

994
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:35,849
Hi-5, this is very important.

995
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:37,331
What is her name?

996
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,607
Her name, yes. Excellent question.

997
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:42,081
It was Tina.

998
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:43,406
Karen.

999
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:45,801
Marge. Lindsey.

1000
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:47,405
Alison.

1001
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:50,566
Sarah or Lupita.

1002
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,130
I want to say Lupita,

1003
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:55,010
but that doesn't feel right
now I'm saying it out loud.

1004
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:56,161
Jennifer.

1005
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:57,765
- Got to find that e-mail.
- Phillipa.

1006
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:59,256
- Sue. Deborah.
- I think I can access the trash.

1007
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:00,281
Annabelle.

1008
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:01,725
- I got it! Addie!
- Yes!

1009
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:03,290
Yes! That's it! Addie!

1010
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:05,203
I knew I'd get there.

1011
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,722
"Dear Addie, you and I,
we're like diamonds in the sky.

1012
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,802
"You're a shooting star I see,

1013
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:14,803
"a vision of ecstasy."

1014
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:17,929
"Shine bright like a diamond."

1015
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:22,487
And he used a high five, see?

1016
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:24,449
I guess now we know why he trashed it.

1017
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:25,961
Shade.

1018
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:28,168
Guys, should we try this?

1019
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:38,520
Addie.

1020
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,764
Access granted.

1021
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:45,327
Snap.

1022
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:02,089
This place is amazing.

1023
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:04,765
The cloud.

1024
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:06,888
I can't believe it.

1025
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:12,485
One little emoji could sure gel lost
in a place like this.

1026
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:22,449
I guess we should make you a Meh
before that Bot comes back, huh?

1027
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:26,326
So, we're gonna... We're gonna do that now?

1028
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:29,323
We had a deal.

1029
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:30,481
Right?

1030
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:33,970
Yeah, okay. Right.

1031
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:36,646
I guess I'll start hacking.

1032
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:00,646
We did it, Gene.

1033
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:02,609
All our dreams are coming true.

1034
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:06,002
I'll be an Alex favorite again,
and you'll be a real Meh.

1035
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:07,320
Yeah!

1036
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:09,243
Do the hand dance
Do the hand dance.

1037
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:11,084
And pinky Pop it with the pinky.

1038
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:12,525
Pop it with the pinky.

1039
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:15,689
Yeah, but this all seems
kind of super-fast now, though.

1040
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:17,091
Doesn't it?

1041
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:21,324
Hi-5, I just didn't expect
to be having these feelings right now.

1042
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:24,969
Well, maybe you should go and express them
while you still can.

1043
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:33,769
So, I've been... I mean...

1044
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:35,810
Ever since we...

1045
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:41,325
Jailbreak, you're the coolest,
most interesting emoji I've ever met.

1046
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:44,131
And after all the adventures that we had,

1047
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:46,407
I'm just not sure I want
all that to go away,

1048
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:50,246
because my feelings
right now are, like, huge.

1049
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:53,889
I just think that they could be enough
for me to want to stay the way I am.

1050
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,526
If it means I could stay here with you.

1051
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:58,647
Like, forever.

1052
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:01,007
Forever and ever and ever.

1053
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:02,923
Maybe longer than that even.

1054
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,251
Like in the fairy tales.

1055
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:13,086
Like, what is "uh"? Is that a good "uh"?

1056
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:17,841
Gene, if this is about
you deciding not to be meh,

1057
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:20,207
then I am all about that.

1058
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:23,608
I like you just the way you are.

1059
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:27,083
But I had a plan.

1060
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:31,285
Right.

1061
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:35,365
I'm not just some princess, Gene,
waiting for my prince.

1062
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:42,088
I mean, what you said was beautiful, but...

1063
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:45,210
Gene.

1064
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:49,205
You're all meh.

1065
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:50,845
The source code worked!

1066
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:53,127
Turns out I didn't need it.

1067
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:57,646
For the first time in my
life, meh is all I feel.

1068
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:01,682
No! Gene!

1069
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,607
Hi. I have an appointment.
I'm a little early.

1070
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:06,523
No problem. I can take you right now.

1071
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:27,766
Jailbreak!

1072
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:29,126
Don't do that!

1073
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:32,647
That freaky huge Bot has got Gene
back inside the phone.

1074
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:33,721
What?

1075
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:37,009
He left looking more meh
than the meh-est meh face I've ever seen.

1076
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:38,360
What did you say to him?

1077
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:41,808
It's what I didn't say.

1078
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:44,207
We've got to go get him.

1079
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:47,762
How are we gonna get in there in time
before he gets deleted?

1080
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:50,489
I can't believe I'm doing this.

1081
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:54,169
You tell anyone you saw this,
and I'll crack more than those knuckles.

1082
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:37,880
Birds do love princesses!

1083
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:39,166
It's not a myth.

1084
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:41,129
It's not a myth at all!

1085
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:45,003
What happened to becoming a favorite?

1086
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:47,367
Guess I'd rather have one real friend.

1087
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:49,084
And let's go get him.

1088
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:56,165
I can't wait to see the
look on Gene's face!

1089
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:00,846
Look at that expression.

1090
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:07,051
Is that for realizing
you've put all of Textopolis at risk,

1091
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:09,600
causing Alex to question our reliability?

1092
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:14,366
Hey, that's going too far, even for me.

1093
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:18,081
If we can delete this malfunction
before his appointment,

1094
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:20,527
they'll discover
there's nothing wrong with the phone.

1095
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:22,449
Any last words?

1096
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:24,771
Meh.

1097
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:26,046
Well, it's loo late for that.

1098
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:28,248
- Delete him!
- Wait.

1099
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:34,363
You delete Gene,
you'll have to delete me, too.

1100
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:38,161
- What?
- I have the same malfunction Gene does.

1101
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:42,801
Dad?

1102
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:45,167
Oh, gosh, I don't know what to do.

1103
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:46,287
Yes, I do.

1104
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:47,521
Bot!

1105
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:50,126
No!

1106
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:51,964
Sorry, Mrs. Meh.

1107
01:07:57,480 --> 01:07:59,847
I did not see that one coming.

1108
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:03,367
Smiler, I think you might be making
too much stink out of all this.

1109
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:05,807
Really? How about you're next?

1110
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:11,330
I was wrong, Gene.

1111
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:13,920
I should've believed in you all along.

1112
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:17,410
What a touching daddy-son reunion moment.

1113
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:19,847
It reminds me of the
time I deleted you both.

1114
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:22,208
Wait. That's this time!

1115
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:24,362
Delete the two malfunctions!

1116
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:27,681
No.

1117
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:32,328
Hows that for an...

1118
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:41,966
Great.

1119
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:54,484
I can't reach!

1120
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:12,003
No! What did you do to my beautiful...

1121
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:14,246
My tooth.

1122
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:19,490
Hand, button.

1123
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:23,366
Jailbreak?

1124
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:25,127
Gene.

1125
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:28,803
You really are a Meh.

1126
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:31,247
What happened to looking out
for number one?

1127
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:35,405
Being number one doesn't matter
if there aren't any other numbers.

1128
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:39,241
Alex's appointment!

1129
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:40,930
He's deleting the phone!

1130
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,764
No, no, no!

1131
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:44,729
Show me Alex.

1132
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:49,616
Are you sure you want to delete everything?

1133
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:50,641
Do it.

1134
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,649
Red alert! Red alert!

1135
01:09:57,720 --> 01:09:59,324
Alex, no!

1136
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:08,285
Game over.

1137
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:13,121
Fellas, I'm afraid this is last call.

1138
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:16,565
Dude, Addie's here. You should go over.

1139
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:22,407
Every time I try, I screw it up.

1140
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:25,163
I don't know how to tell her how I feel.

1141
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:28,723
If we help Alex connect to Addie,
maybe he won't delete us.

1142
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:31,690
I might be able to bypass the wipe
and get a text through to him.

1143
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:33,444
But we'll only have time to send one.

1144
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:34,567
Maybe I should go.

1145
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:36,130
He has love in his eyes.

1146
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:39,086
Send me. Alex looks nervous, too.

1147
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:41,003
He's more shy than nervous.

1148
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:42,361
Stop!

1149
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,411
It's Gene.

1150
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:47,050
He's all of those things.

1151
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:50,846
An emoji should only be one thing.

1152
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:52,606
Really'?

1153
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:54,766
The Princess!

1154
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:55,966
Linda!

1155
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:57,530
Not now, Mom!

1156
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:00,486
Gene, you got this.

1157
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:03,848
That's not me anymore.

1158
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:13,484
But I have to try.

1159
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:15,561
It's starting!

1160
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:17,085
No, it's ending!

1161
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,807
- Almost in?
- I'm working on it.

1162
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:42,046
Mom? Dad?

1163
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:44,801
No.

1164
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:46,481
I'm in.

1165
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:50,091
Last time I was in this cube,
I screwed everything up.

1166
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:53,804
Gene, why do you think I came back?

1167
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:55,730
It's because of you.

1168
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:57,721
Me?

1169
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:00,602
It's all inside of you, Gene.

1170
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:02,762
Just try to bring it back.

1171
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:05,085
And do you.

1172
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:08,567
- Hi-5!
- I don't want to wave good-bye.

1173
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:11,164
It's now or never, Gene.

1174
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:35,400
Jailbreak, now!

1175
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:53,246
Check out this emoji.

1176
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:08,840
No way.

1177
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:25,964
Hey, I got your text.

1178
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:28,611
That's one super-cool emoji.

1179
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:30,523
I know, right?

1180
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:34,560
A lot of feelings in one. I get it.

1181
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:39,086
I like that you're one of those guys
who can actually express his feelings.

1182
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:41,288
Yeah. That's me.

1183
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:51,007
- So, do you think you'd want to...
- Yes.

1184
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:53,606
I'd love to go to the dance with you.

1185
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:57,251
Hey, excuse me.

1186
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:25,120
We made it!

1187
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:27,123
I could've lost you, Peter Pinkie.

1188
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:28,850
Or you, Reggie Ring Finger.

1189
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:30,888
Even you, Tiberius Thumb.

1190
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:39,244
Change your mind?

1191
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:41,084
Yeah, maybe it's weird, but...

1192
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:42,571
I'm gonna hold on to it.

1193
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:45,565
Gene, you did it!

1194
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:47,290
You saved us all!

1195
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:02,251
Oh, Mel.

1196
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:04,766
Gene! Gene!

1197
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:05,921
Gene! Gene! Gene!

1198
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,322
Gene. Gene. Gene.

1199
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:13,206
Gene! Gene! Gene! Gene!

1200
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:17,325
Gene! Gene! Gene!

1201
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:18,970
They love us! And Hi-5!

1202
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:21,805
And Hi-5! And Hi-5! And Hi-5!

1203
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:23,689
They love both of us!

1204
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:44,450
Hey, what up, Gene? Slap me some skin.

1205
01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:46,970
And a little porridge for the pinkie.

1206
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:51,442
Hey, Hi-5, save me a dance for later.

1207
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:53,921
As long as you're not all hands again.

1208
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:56,289
Back on top of the hand pile.

1209
01:15:58,480 --> 01:15:59,766
You're not on the list.

1210
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:01,330
- Wait, what?
- What's going on?

1211
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:04,411
From now on, everyone is welcome!

1212
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:06,323
Wait, what is all this?

1213
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:07,731
It's for you, Gene.

1214
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:14,164
Everybody, the Emoji Pop!

1215
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:28,968
This is jazzy.

1216
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,001
Yeah.

1217
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:39,846
Go, Eggplant! Go, Eggplant! Go, Eggplant!

1218
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:59,483
We are out of Alex's pocket, emojis.

1219
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:01,562
This is not a butt dial.

1220
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:03,244
To your cubes.

1221
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:14,202
- Are we up and running?
- Roger that.

1222
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:16,408
