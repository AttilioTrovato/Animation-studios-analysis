1
00:01:23,874 --> 00:01:26,501
Dear Santa, are you real?

2
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:28,587
If you live at the North Pole...

3
00:01:28,754 --> 00:01:31,965
...how come I can't see your house
when I look on Google Earth?

4
00:01:33,467 --> 00:01:35,510
Are you Saint Nicholas?

5
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:38,138
Because you'd be incredibly old.

6
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:40,808
How do you have time
to read all the letters...

7
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:42,977
...from all the children in the world?

8
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:47,565
And how many cookies and mince pies
have you eaten in all of history?

9
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:50,901
How do you get all the presents
in the sack?

10
00:01:51,068 --> 00:01:53,403
Does your sack have to
get bigger every year...

11
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:56,407
...because of exponential
population growth?

12
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:58,826
And how do you get down
the chimneys?

13
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:01,495
I put my head in ours
and it's really small.

14
00:02:01,662 --> 00:02:04,081
Even if you could squeeze down it
in one minute...

15
00:02:04,248 --> 00:02:07,334
...there's nine houses in my road
so that's nearly 10 minutes.

16
00:02:07,501 --> 00:02:10,045
And there are millions of roads
in the world.

17
00:02:10,212 --> 00:02:13,798
It must be so hard being Santa
these days.

18
00:02:14,216 --> 00:02:18,136
I mean, what if after all of that,
I'm staying at Grandma's?

19
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:22,804
Santa, how can you get round
the whole world in just one night?

20
00:02:23,517 --> 00:02:24,517
My friend said...

21
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,437
...that you'd have to go so fast...

22
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:31,104
...it would make you and the sleigh
and the reindeer all burn up.

23
00:02:31,567 --> 00:02:35,529
I think you are real.
But how do you do it?

24
00:02:35,696 --> 00:02:40,196
For Christmas I would love
a pink Twinkle Bike with stabilizers.

25
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:44,705
But please don't bring it
if it makes you and the reindeer burn.

26
00:02:44,955 --> 00:02:49,455
Love, Gwen Hines. 23 Mimosa Avenue,
Trelew, Cornwall, England.

27
00:02:50,586 --> 00:02:53,005
Dear Gwen,
thank you for your letter...

28
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:56,258
...and brilliant picture.

29
00:02:56,425 --> 00:03:00,925
Your request for a pink Twinkle Bike
will be passed on to Santa.

30
00:03:01,305 --> 00:03:04,057
And, yes, do believe in Santa.

31
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,727
He is real.

32
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,480
He's the greatest man ever.

33
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:12,650
And he can get around the world
to every child...

34
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:15,486
...without a single reindeer
being roasted elf...

35
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:17,529
Hurt.

36
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:22,572
By the time the sun comes up
on Christmas Day, he'll get to you too...

37
00:03:23,452 --> 00:03:24,494
...using his...

38
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:27,414
...special magic.

39
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:32,688
First Field Elf Battalion, set.

40
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:35,440
- Straighten that teddy bear, soldier.
- Ma'am.

41
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:43,532
That's a:

42
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:44,699
"Ho, ho, ho" Aarhus.

43
00:04:47,077 --> 00:04:49,913
Field elves, jingle! Drop time,
18.14 seconds per household.

44
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,302
Left foot, sir. Right foot, sir.

45
00:05:04,386 --> 00:05:05,428
That's it, that's it.

46
00:05:06,013 --> 00:05:07,389
Dog food incoming.

47
00:05:07,556 --> 00:05:08,932
Meaty chunks in the hole.

48
00:05:13,145 --> 00:05:16,523
Wow, a grand piano. This kid
must have been good his whole life.

49
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:44,301
Marvellous. Gets me every time.

50
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,644
Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.

51
00:05:55,062 --> 00:05:56,062
Merry...

52
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:07,700
Carrot chomped.

53
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:50,284
- Sir?
- Goodness me.

54
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:53,579
Sorry.

55
00:06:54,663 --> 00:06:56,289
Drop complete. Stand by, S-1.

56
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:58,917
- You're gonna make it, soldier.
- Aarhus is merry.

57
00:06:59,251 --> 00:07:00,669
Santa has left the building.

58
00:07:14,224 --> 00:07:16,017
North Pole to S-1, you have weather...

59
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:17,769
...fluctuation. Update camouflage.

60
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,396
Roger that, Control.

61
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:20,439
Hull projection...

62
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:21,857
- ...optimized.
- Roger, S-1.

63
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:23,150
Denmark cleared.

64
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:26,445
Next drop, Flensburg,
minus 12.4 seconds.

65
00:07:27,571 --> 00:07:28,571
Flensburg weather:

66
00:07:28,864 --> 00:07:29,864
Deep, crisp, even.

67
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,491
- Making a list.
- Check it twice.

68
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,327
- Checking twice.
- A wrap for Denmark.

69
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:36,663
Converting milk and cookies to biofuel.
- Hello?

70
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:42,670
- Santa on bridge.
- Sorry.

71
00:07:42,836 --> 00:07:43,836
Forgot the PIN code.

72
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,881
Just crossed into Germany, sir.

73
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,257
Germany.

74
00:07:47,424 --> 00:07:49,926
- So many countries these days.
- It's a big night, sir.

75
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:53,847
My 70th mission. Yes.

76
00:07:54,014 --> 00:07:55,098
Oh, sorry.

77
00:07:55,265 --> 00:07:57,767
One too many mince pies.

78
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,645
Looking forward to it? Retirement?

79
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:03,440
Ten seconds to Flensburg.

80
00:08:03,607 --> 00:08:05,275
Maintain current...

81
00:08:05,859 --> 00:08:08,403
- Carry on.
- Update national protocol.

82
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:11,531
Delete rice pudding and carrot.
German leave-out for Santa...

83
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,785
...is shoe on front step.
Repeat, shoe on step.

84
00:08:15,869 --> 00:08:18,246
- 600AM3.
- Gift secured.

85
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:20,541
Oi, soldier. Get off your baubles.

86
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:23,460
What happened to peace and goodwill
to all men, sarge?

87
00:08:23,627 --> 00:08:26,129
It don't say nothing about elves, soldier.
Go, go, go!

88
00:08:26,296 --> 00:08:27,463
Engage rooftops.

89
00:08:27,631 --> 00:08:28,631
It's snow time!

90
00:08:31,635 --> 00:08:33,053
S-1, hold drop altitude.

91
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,346
This is Germany, Father.

92
00:08:34,513 --> 00:08:37,265
Drive on the right.
National dish: sausage.

93
00:08:37,474 --> 00:08:41,974
Okay, let's show them, people.
Operation Santa Claus is coming to town.

94
00:08:58,954 --> 00:09:00,413
- Drop complete.
- Drop complete.

95
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:02,291
- Drop complete.
- Drop complete.

96
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,585
- Drop complete.
- Drop complete.

97
00:09:10,632 --> 00:09:12,258
Operational efficiency:

98
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:14,261
- One hundred percent.
- Hold the handrail.

99
00:09:15,971 --> 00:09:16,763
Dear, I'm sorry.

100
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:17,931
Thanks. Brendon Doherty.

101
00:09:18,098 --> 00:09:19,641
Ruby Miller. That's Grace Smith.

102
00:09:19,808 --> 00:09:20,642
She wants...

103
00:09:20,809 --> 00:09:22,727
- ...an elephant.
- What are you doing here?

104
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,855
Got to get this letter
from Maria Costa...

105
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:25,772
...to Steve.

106
00:09:25,939 --> 00:09:26,939
Oh, no! Maria!

107
00:09:27,274 --> 00:09:28,358
Bye-bye, Maria.

108
00:09:29,401 --> 00:09:30,568
Is this yours, Arthur?

109
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:31,862
Oh, thanks, Kenneth.

110
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:33,196
- Merry Christmas.
- Want...

111
00:09:33,363 --> 00:09:34,113
...a ride?

112
00:09:34,281 --> 00:09:35,281
Doubt it.

113
00:09:35,365 --> 00:09:36,616
No, thanks. I'm not...

114
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:38,452
...very good with heights, speed...

115
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:39,369
...and that thing!

116
00:09:39,536 --> 00:09:42,080
- Buckle down, people.
- Buckle down.

117
00:09:42,247 --> 00:09:43,414
- Peter.
- Ready, sir.

118
00:09:43,582 --> 00:09:45,292
SITREP on special forces.

119
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:47,043
- Where are they?
- America, sir.

120
00:09:47,252 --> 00:09:49,754
White House. Delivering to the
president's children, sir.

121
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:53,175
Okay. Left out of the Oval Office,
right at the Cabinet Room...

122
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:54,384
...via the air vents.

123
00:09:54,551 --> 00:09:56,344
You think of everything, sir.

124
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:58,680
Thank you, Peter. I'd love an espresso.

125
00:09:58,847 --> 00:09:59,848
Coming right up.

126
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:02,309
Beg your pardon. Well done!

127
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:03,727
Merry Christmas.

128
00:10:04,394 --> 00:10:06,354
- Wow, brilliant.
- Mind the glasses.

129
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:07,564
Keep up, everybody.

130
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,524
- Arthur.
- Sorry. Can I just...?

131
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:11,610
No, never mind.

132
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:12,819
Do you mind if I...?

133
00:10:12,986 --> 00:10:13,653
Oh, dear.

134
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:14,488
I'm so sorry.

135
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,782
- 65...
- Merry Christmas.

136
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,701
- FRC...
- And a happy New Year.

137
00:10:21,578 --> 00:10:22,745
What a night, sir.

138
00:10:23,163 --> 00:10:27,000
Out with the old Santa,
in with the new, eh?

139
00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:29,919
Let's focus on the now, eh, Peter?

140
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:30,921
Support teams...

141
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:32,881
- ...prep Poland.
- Poland.

142
00:10:33,048 --> 00:10:34,799
Poland. Do you know what they call...

143
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,176
...Dad here?

144
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:42,974
Anyway...

145
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,268
I guess he's harmless.

146
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:47,563
I'm terribly sorry.

147
00:10:47,729 --> 00:10:48,729
Is that your leg?

148
00:10:51,483 --> 00:10:52,483
I'm sorry!

149
00:10:54,194 --> 00:10:56,779
I'm really sorry.
It's my Christmas slippers on the ice.

150
00:10:58,657 --> 00:11:00,033
They're from China.

151
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,200
- Found it
- What?

152
00:11:01,326 --> 00:11:02,577
The letter. The one I said.

153
00:11:02,744 --> 00:11:04,036
From Maria Costa.

154
00:11:04,204 --> 00:11:06,998
She asked for a Pocket-Puppy,
but she wants the blue one.

155
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,585
It looks like her auntie's dog,
Biffo, that ran away.

156
00:11:09,751 --> 00:11:11,210
I remember because she sent...

157
00:11:11,378 --> 00:11:12,629
...a picture of Biffo. See?

158
00:11:12,796 --> 00:11:14,380
- Child CG786K?
- Look, Arthur...

159
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:16,675
This was Greece, sir.

160
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,426
Five countries ago, sir.

161
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:24,557
I just want it to be perfect
for every kid.

162
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:27,060
Hey, there's Dad. Santa!

163
00:11:27,227 --> 00:11:30,730
Maria Costa, Dad.
Did she get the blue one?!

164
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:33,108
Little bro, it's great to have you around.

165
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:37,775
You bring a genuine aura
of seasonal positivity.

166
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:39,239
Thanks, Steve.

167
00:11:39,406 --> 00:11:43,076
But could you not be
in Mission Control...

168
00:11:43,243 --> 00:11:46,329
...at all for the rest of the night?

169
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,750
Yeah.

170
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,335
- All right?
- I’ll never walk...

171
00:11:52,502 --> 00:11:54,545
- ...again.
- Of course.

172
00:11:54,796 --> 00:11:55,963
Right.

173
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:57,966
Sorry if I...

174
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:00,301
Brilliant.

175
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:02,179
They should put him...

176
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:05,307
- ...somewhere out of harm's way.
- What, like the South Pole?

177
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:08,017
Waker!

178
00:12:08,101 --> 00:12:09,143
We have a waker!

179
00:12:10,145 --> 00:12:11,479
And Santa's in there!

180
00:12:14,691 --> 00:12:15,900
Code red.

181
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,111
Repeat." code red.

182
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:30,081
Santa? Are you here?

183
00:12:37,297 --> 00:12:38,006
Steve?

184
00:12:38,173 --> 00:12:39,257
Hold on, Father.

185
00:12:39,424 --> 00:12:40,675
Intel! Get me Intel!

186
00:12:40,842 --> 00:12:42,468
Santa's head seems to be resting...

187
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:45,138
...on some sort of "try me" button, sir.

188
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:49,017
It's the Quack Quack Moo
Activity Farm, sir.

189
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:51,061
It features 12 separate animal sounds.

190
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:53,772
- Sings "Old MacDonald Had A Farm."
- The moment...

191
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:57,651
...your father lifts his head, there'll be
10 seconds of constant mooing.

192
00:12:57,859 --> 00:12:59,193
Risk of mooing: 98 percent.

193
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:00,987
Captain Marino...

194
00:13:01,154 --> 00:13:03,239
...you'll have to take the batteries out.

195
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:04,491
He'd have to get past...

196
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:08,244
...the wrapping, the box and 14 twist ties
anchoring it to the cardboard.

197
00:13:08,453 --> 00:13:09,453
It's too noisy!

198
00:13:09,579 --> 00:13:11,414
It'll wake the boy! He'll see Santa!

199
00:13:11,623 --> 00:13:13,583
Remember 1816...

200
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,252
...when Santa was seen.
They tracked him home.

201
00:13:16,461 --> 00:13:17,628
He had to go into hiding.

202
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:22,296
No Christmas for six years.
The elves all alone!

203
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:24,427
The elves alone!

204
00:13:25,762 --> 00:13:26,804
Calm, people!

205
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,848
It's not 1816 now.

206
00:13:29,057 --> 00:13:32,143
Marino, your HOHO
is equipped with state-of-the-art...

207
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:35,897
...EMF sensor technology hacked directly
from the military's missile programme.

208
00:13:36,064 --> 00:13:37,815
I want you to locate the batteries...

209
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,568
...and perform a Level 3
giftwrap incision.

210
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:42,446
Go in through the robin.

211
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,617
Incising robin.

212
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:56,543
Big girl's blouse.

213
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,794
Lot of fuss.

214
00:13:57,961 --> 00:13:59,879
I did my 70 missions...

215
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:02,215
...without any of this malarkey.

216
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:03,925
Didn't we, lad?

217
00:14:04,676 --> 00:14:07,345
- Twist ties clear.
- Can I watch with you, Grandsanta?

218
00:14:07,512 --> 00:14:08,596
Shut the door!

219
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:09,806
Hell's berries...

220
00:14:09,973 --> 00:14:13,184
- ...it's the North Pole!
- Kid still asleep? He mustn't see Santa.

221
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,687
- Dad would rather die than spoil it.
- What if you...

222
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:17,438
...wake the odd nipper? A whack...

223
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:20,025
...with a sock of sand,
dab of whisky on the lips...

224
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,735
...they don't remember.

225
00:14:23,695 --> 00:14:25,697
- Screwdriver elf.
- Yes!

226
00:14:25,864 --> 00:14:26,614
What happened...

227
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:29,951
...to going down the "chimbley"?
Never did me any har...

228
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:32,120
Get off me!

229
00:14:32,287 --> 00:14:33,538
You smell like a wet elf.

230
00:14:33,705 --> 00:14:35,498
Goodness! Down, boy! Basket.

231
00:14:35,665 --> 00:14:37,041
Here you are, Grandsanta.

232
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,044
I've made you a nice mince pie.

233
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,004
I can't eat that. It gets in me teeth.

234
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:42,171
Oh, dear.

235
00:14:42,297 --> 00:14:43,423
Now I've got to visit...

236
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:44,340
...the elf hospital...

237
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:47,093
...look over a treaty with Greenland
and make the gravy.

238
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,346
Then we'll finally have
the whole family home for Christmas.

239
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:51,765
They're nearly done!

240
00:14:52,015 --> 00:14:54,684
Battery clear.
- Oh, no.

241
00:14:56,019 --> 00:14:57,562
It's the detachable milk maid!

242
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:00,023
- She's got her own power source!
- Five seconds...

243
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:02,192
...till she starts singing!

244
00:15:03,902 --> 00:15:04,903
Four!

245
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:07,030
Three!

246
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,324
Two!

247
00:15:10,575 --> 00:15:11,409
One!

248
00:15:11,576 --> 00:15:12,868
Use your HOHO. Exit...

249
00:15:13,036 --> 00:15:14,370
...code 12. Code 12!

250
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:28,468
Okay, go, go, go!

251
00:15:28,635 --> 00:15:30,803
Revise drop time to 14.13 seconds.

252
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:32,347
Let's pick this up, people!

253
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:33,181
Drop time...

254
00:15:33,348 --> 00:15:34,849
...revised. Picking this up...

255
00:15:35,016 --> 00:15:36,016
...people.

256
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:37,227
Everybody, mission...

257
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:38,436
...re-engage.

258
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,442
Three...

259
00:15:44,484 --> 00:15:45,318
...two...

260
00:15:45,485 --> 00:15:46,485
"fine!

261
00:15:47,654 --> 00:15:49,530
Mission accomplished.

262
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:51,657
Hey!

263
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:00,333
Oh, what a night that was.

264
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,293
That detachable milk maid thing.

265
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:05,380
This is just the beginning,
right, sir?

266
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:07,799
I got you a present, sir.

267
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:10,343
Not S for Steve, sir.

268
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,096
S for Santa.

269
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:17,392
Oh, I don't know about that, Peter.
Okay...

270
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:19,269
...let's bring them home.

271
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:55,055
CCTV...

272
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:57,307
...in every room!
Had to go under the floor!

273
00:16:57,474 --> 00:17:00,435
- Sarah.
- Back! Holly injury coming through!

274
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:02,603
Hey, fancy...

275
00:17:02,729 --> 00:17:04,230
...a trip on the S-1, Arthur?

276
00:17:04,397 --> 00:17:05,981
It only goes 150,000...

277
00:17:06,149 --> 00:17:07,900
- ...miles an hour.
- No, no. Thanks.

278
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,236
I see a bit of the world in my office,
you know.

279
00:17:10,403 --> 00:17:13,197
Some of the stamps I get
are amazing.

280
00:17:13,698 --> 00:17:14,698
Excuse me.

281
00:17:15,408 --> 00:17:16,742
Santa!

282
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,077
Dad!

283
00:17:18,578 --> 00:17:19,870
Dad! Dad!

284
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:21,914
I'm sorry. So sorry. Dad!

285
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:23,207
Dad!

286
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:24,917
- Santa's waving!
- He's waving at me!

287
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,419
- He's waving at me!
- At me!

288
00:17:26,586 --> 00:17:27,587
Dad!

289
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,339
Arthur.

290
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:32,050
Happy Christmas.

291
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:33,885
You too.

292
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,846
You were fantastic!

293
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,350
Look! Christmas slippers.

294
00:17:41,434 --> 00:17:43,227
Well done. Yes.

295
00:17:43,853 --> 00:17:45,104
Father?

296
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,357
There he is. Steve!

297
00:17:52,862 --> 00:17:55,573
Mission accomplished!

298
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:00,578
Tonight we delivered...

299
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:03,707
...2 billion presents.

300
00:18:03,915 --> 00:18:05,374
On this...

301
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,043
...my 70th mission!

302
00:18:09,045 --> 00:18:10,880
We'll miss you, Santa!

303
00:18:11,047 --> 00:18:12,047
Stand by.

304
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:15,969
Oh, thank you.

305
00:18:16,636 --> 00:18:19,430
You know, I sometimes think
I couldn't do it without you.

306
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,391
And my splendid...

307
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:25,019
...Margaret, who's stood by me
all these years...

308
00:18:25,186 --> 00:18:27,605
...very ably doing all that...

309
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:28,898
...stuff...

310
00:18:29,065 --> 00:18:31,567
...that women do when
their husbands work. Marvellous.

311
00:18:34,195 --> 00:18:35,654
And Arthur, yes, doing...

312
00:18:35,822 --> 00:18:37,824
...vital work in Maintenance,
really vital.

313
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:39,325
I... I work...

314
00:18:39,492 --> 00:18:40,201
...in Letters.

315
00:18:40,368 --> 00:18:43,537
- Letters, of course. I'm so sorry.
- You moved me...

316
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:46,916
...after I tripped over that plug
and melted down the elf barracks.

317
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:48,363
I lost everything in that flood!

318
00:18:49,085 --> 00:18:50,544
Yes. Now...

319
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:55,675
...many years ago, my father told me...

320
00:18:57,594 --> 00:19:01,431
...that being Santa
is the best job in the world.

321
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,558
He was right.

322
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,435
I've loced it.

323
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:12,066
I can't wait for year 71!

324
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:19,240
Merry Christmas, everyone.

325
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:35,214
He's red, he's white!
He's worked all through the night!

326
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:37,008
Santa!

327
00:19:51,898 --> 00:19:55,860
"What do you get
if you eat Christmas decorations?

328
00:19:56,277 --> 00:19:57,945
Tinselitis!"

329
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:04,285
Isn't this the best bit of Christmas?

330
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:11,334
It certainly is, Arthur.
The whole family together.

331
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:13,836
How about a toast, Malcolm?

332
00:20:15,046 --> 00:20:18,591
Well, here's to me doing
an even better job next year.

333
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,218
- Next year.
- But you're...

334
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:24,013
- ...already perfect, Dad.
- That turkey did more than him.

335
00:20:25,306 --> 00:20:27,224
You wouldn't understand, Father.

336
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:30,562
I've rather moved things on
since your day. Eh, Steve?

337
00:20:31,646 --> 00:20:35,483
Forget Techno Tommy. He's texting
on his calculator after another job.

338
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:36,650
It's a Handheld...

339
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:39,946
...Operational and Homing Organiser.
The HOHO 3000.

340
00:20:40,947 --> 00:20:42,615
I'm enacting mission closure.

341
00:20:43,366 --> 00:20:46,744
Aren't you the fancy nancy?
Don't matter what you come up with.

342
00:20:46,911 --> 00:20:51,206
You may be next in line, but you'll never
get to be Santa unless you knock him off.

343
00:20:54,669 --> 00:20:56,003
I've got you all a present.

344
00:20:56,212 --> 00:21:00,712
After all the hard work, I wanted everyone
to have some Christmas fun.

345
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:25,158
- I'm Santa!
- No, no, I'm Santa. It's ridiculous.

346
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:28,995
- You just took the piece out of my hand.
- Well, I am actually Santa...

347
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:30,705
...so I think I should have it.

348
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:33,666
- Yes. You're the nonexecutive figurehead.
- Exactly.

349
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:34,959
- Figurehead.
- It means...

350
00:21:35,126 --> 00:21:37,253
...a fatty with a beard who fits the suit.

351
00:21:37,962 --> 00:21:39,463
The other pieces are good too.

352
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,674
Or I can make extra Santas
for everyone.

353
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,385
Why don't you be the candle, Steve?

354
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,721
All those bright ideas, eh?

355
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:50,266
Fine. I'm the candle,
Arthur's the turkey...

356
00:21:50,433 --> 00:21:53,936
...and you, Father,
are, of course, Santa.

357
00:21:54,103 --> 00:21:56,522
Grandsanta, you can be
this charming relic.

358
00:21:56,689 --> 00:21:58,607
"Relic"? "Relic"?

359
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:01,360
I did the whole of Christmas
in one of these, Arthur.

360
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:04,822
Oh, yes. I didn't need
a trillion elves in bleepy hats.

361
00:22:04,989 --> 00:22:06,031
We don't fly about...

362
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:08,910
...throwing lead-painted toys
down chimneys anymore.

363
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:10,411
That space sends you back...

364
00:22:10,578 --> 00:22:13,372
- ...to Lapland.
- Malcolm, where did you get those?

365
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,084
Just moving things along. Do I win?

366
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:17,794
Cheats, the pair of you!

367
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:19,128
Mum, are you okay?

368
00:22:19,295 --> 00:22:23,215
Polar bear, dear. Attacked me on the ice.
Good I did that online survival course...

369
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:25,968
- ...or there'd be one less for turkey.
- Christmas has...

370
00:22:26,135 --> 00:22:29,638
...gone right down the rodney hole.
You're a postman with a spaceship.

371
00:22:30,431 --> 00:22:34,931
My S-1 festivized the world
at 1860 times the speed of sound.

372
00:22:35,478 --> 00:22:38,022
Christmas 1941, World War ll...

373
00:22:38,189 --> 00:22:40,900
...did the whole thing with
six reindeer and a drunken elf!

374
00:22:41,067 --> 00:22:42,610
I was shot at, Arthur.

375
00:22:42,777 --> 00:22:45,029
Took 12 direct hits.
Lost three reindeer.

376
00:22:45,196 --> 00:22:45,863
What happened...

377
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:48,350
- ...to the elf?
- Fell out of the sleigh over Lake Geneva.

378
00:22:48,449 --> 00:22:49,449
Never saw him again.

379
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:50,702
Goodness. Now...

380
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:54,455
"Christmas crackers.
Sing 'Silent Night' backwards."

381
00:22:54,622 --> 00:22:56,165
Who'd know that?

382
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:03,506
I went on alone.

383
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:06,634
I could still do it now, Arthur.
Just give me a go!

384
00:23:06,801 --> 00:23:09,011
- In a heap of sticks.
- "Heap of... "?

385
00:23:09,178 --> 00:23:10,387
Let me up and at him!

386
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,974
I'll show you, Robby the Robot!

387
00:23:13,182 --> 00:23:15,142
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

388
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:16,435
I'll have that back.

389
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,312
- Would have won anyway.
- What?

390
00:23:18,521 --> 00:23:20,231
Oh, yeah. Run away...

391
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:21,941
...now you're losing!

392
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,029
Steve!

393
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:29,406
Steve.

394
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:30,657
Don't be upset. Look.

395
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:32,284
You keep this.

396
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:35,955
Then you can be Santa next time.

397
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:38,916
That'll be you there, Steve.

398
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:40,668
Next year...

399
00:23:40,835 --> 00:23:41,835
...I bet.

400
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,754
You'll be great.

401
00:23:45,256 --> 00:23:46,966
How many times, Arthur?

402
00:23:47,133 --> 00:23:51,178
It's the North Pole. Shut the doors.

403
00:23:54,432 --> 00:23:55,224
I secured the gift.

404
00:23:55,391 --> 00:23:57,476
- Gift secured!
- Just can't be.

405
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:58,978
The system is foolproof.

406
00:23:59,145 --> 00:24:00,437
It has to be an error, sir.

407
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:01,605
"Error"?

408
00:24:01,689 --> 00:24:03,774
I spotted the ribbon
glinting in the shadows.

409
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,026
I am actually...

410
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:06,277
...trained in wrapping.

411
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:10,698
And I said to myself, "Bryony, the
wrapping looks okay. Thank goodness.

412
00:24:10,865 --> 00:24:13,200
But that present should not
be lying in the..."

413
00:24:13,409 --> 00:24:15,160
- Thank you, soldier.
- Has someone...

414
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:17,288
...got the wrong present? That's awful.

415
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:18,497
- Whose is it?
- No one...

416
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:19,665
...gets the wrong...

417
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:21,375
...present. 47785...

418
00:24:21,542 --> 00:24:23,126
...BXK...

419
00:24:23,294 --> 00:24:24,670
"Gift undelivered"?

420
00:24:24,837 --> 00:24:26,547
They got nothing?

421
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:27,757
A child's...

422
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:29,008
...been missed!

423
00:24:29,175 --> 00:24:31,051
Not necessarily.

424
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,264
A child's been missed!

425
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:36,891
Wanna wake up the North Pole?

426
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:38,517
Good idea. A child's...

427
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:39,894
- ...been missed!
- Arthur!

428
00:24:41,604 --> 00:24:42,646
Everything all right?

429
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:44,190
There's been a glitch.

430
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:46,734
"A glitch"? We've missed a child!

431
00:24:46,901 --> 00:24:49,028
Really? Dear, oh, dear.

432
00:24:49,195 --> 00:24:50,195
That's awful.

433
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:51,822
How did you let it happen, Steven?

434
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,950
How did I...?
I thought it was your mission.

435
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:56,410
- No. This is your department.
- What'll we do?

436
00:24:56,577 --> 00:24:58,954
We must... We must...

437
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:02,375
- What must we do, Steven?
- There's nothing to do.

438
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:04,168
The mission was a success.

439
00:25:04,335 --> 00:25:05,895
We can't leave a child
out of Christmas.

440
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,047
Sunrise at destination...

441
00:25:08,214 --> 00:25:11,050
...is 7:39 a.m. There's no way
to get there in time.

442
00:25:11,217 --> 00:25:12,718
Except, of course, for the S-1.

443
00:25:12,885 --> 00:25:14,928
- The S-1. Right-o.
- No! The S-1

444
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:17,306
...has just travelled 7 million miles.

445
00:25:17,473 --> 00:25:18,557
We could damage it.

446
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:19,809
Oh, dear.

447
00:25:20,351 --> 00:25:23,062
- And risk the lives of the elves.
- Oh, my. No.

448
00:25:23,229 --> 00:25:24,521
I'll go, sir!

449
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:25,940
Bryony Shelfley...

450
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:28,109
...Wrapping Division. Grade 3, sir.

451
00:25:28,317 --> 00:25:30,986
- Who asked you?
- I wasn't called up for field duty.

452
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:33,281
I served out my mission
in Gift Wrap Support.

453
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:36,868
I wrapped 264,000 presents
in three days, sir.

454
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:38,744
If you want that bike delivered...

455
00:25:38,911 --> 00:25:40,245
...in a perfect state...

456
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:42,081
...of enwrapment, then I'm your elf.

457
00:25:42,248 --> 00:25:43,624
No one is going.

458
00:25:43,791 --> 00:25:44,625
It's impossible.

459
00:25:44,792 --> 00:25:46,043
- But this child...
- It's a...

460
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:50,710
...margin of error
of 0.00000001514834 percent...

461
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,551
...sir.

462
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,261
I mean, hello?

463
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:56,512
Where's the champagne?

464
00:25:56,679 --> 00:26:01,179
My department has delivered
the most outstanding Christmas ever.

465
00:26:03,352 --> 00:26:05,020
Well done, us.

466
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:07,481
But there's a child without a present.

467
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:10,192
Arthur, Christmas is not a time
for emotion.

468
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:13,445
We will get 47785BXK a present...

469
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:15,823
...within the window of Christmas.

470
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:18,492
We'll messenger the item.
It'll be there in five days.

471
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:20,661
But that'll ruin the magic.

472
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:26,458
If there was any way at all
to make the drop tonight...

473
00:26:26,667 --> 00:26:27,834
But it can't be done.

474
00:26:28,002 --> 00:26:29,044
Your brother...

475
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:31,547
...knows about these things.

476
00:26:31,714 --> 00:26:36,093
I won't sleep easy after this, Arthur,
but there it is.

477
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,511
Can't be done.

478
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:41,599
Merry Christmas.

479
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:49,857
Arthur! You're compromising...

480
00:26:50,024 --> 00:26:51,650
...the wrapping! That is not...

481
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:53,528
...a toy! Well, it is...

482
00:26:53,694 --> 00:26:55,070
...but, I mean, that's not...

483
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:56,321
Arthur!

484
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:58,532
Oh, come on, come on...

485
00:26:58,699 --> 00:27:02,202
...come on. Child 47785BXK...

486
00:27:02,453 --> 00:27:03,871
...where are you?

487
00:27:05,706 --> 00:27:08,166
"Dear Santa, my friend
doesn't believe in you.

488
00:27:08,334 --> 00:27:11,378
For Christmas I'd like
a pink Twinkle Bike.

489
00:27:11,712 --> 00:27:13,630
Gwen Hines.

490
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:18,298
23 Mimosa Avenue,
Trelew, Cornwall, England."

491
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:44,286
Lights out.

492
00:27:45,788 --> 00:27:48,290
This figurehead thingy:

493
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:51,418
I'm not just a fatty with a suit, am I?

494
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:53,921
Of course not, dear.

495
00:27:54,088 --> 00:27:56,840
No. I'm Santa.

496
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,342
Children...

497
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:01,012
...rely on me.

498
00:28:03,472 --> 00:28:04,598
Here.

499
00:28:04,765 --> 00:28:08,560
Thank you. It's just cheques
for the boys and cash for Father.

500
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:10,062
Oh, Malcolm.

501
00:28:10,229 --> 00:28:13,857
It's the 2 billion other gifts, dear.
Christmas has become...

502
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:15,067
...such a mad rush.

503
00:28:15,234 --> 00:28:17,819
Until you retire.

504
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:19,738
Retire?

505
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:23,576
Sit next to Father,
watching Steve on TV?

506
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:25,703
You are sitting on
a level one access HOHO.

507
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,831
Please state your identity.
State your identity.

508
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:31,792
Who would I be?

509
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,129
You'd be my Malcolm, dear.

510
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:37,756
And there's Arthur.

511
00:28:37,965 --> 00:28:39,508
Dear Arthur.

512
00:28:39,675 --> 00:28:41,927
- What a puzzle.
- This one's for me, dear.

513
00:28:44,847 --> 00:28:46,348
Happy Christmas, Margaret.

514
00:28:46,515 --> 00:28:47,557
Oh, thank you.

515
00:28:47,725 --> 00:28:50,394
I'm still very much up to the job,
you know.

516
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:55,107
Good night, dear.

517
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,027
Good night, Malcolm.

518
00:29:01,739 --> 00:29:03,949
It just can't be. It can't.

519
00:29:04,158 --> 00:29:07,953
- It just can't be. It can't. It just can't be!
- What's all this...

520
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,162
...kadoodle, young man?

521
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,039
Grandsanta.

522
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:10,998
This little girl.

523
00:29:11,165 --> 00:29:12,583
She's been missed!

524
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:15,794
So much for your brother's
fancy-pants technology.

525
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:18,673
Steve and Dad racked their brains
but said it's impossible.

526
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:20,006
Is it, now?

527
00:29:20,174 --> 00:29:23,927
Missed a child. Dear, oh dear,
sends shivers down me shins.

528
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,305
In two hours, she's gonna wake up...

529
00:29:26,472 --> 00:29:29,975
...tear downstairs,
search under the tree...

530
00:29:30,476 --> 00:29:33,854
...and the look on her face...

531
00:29:35,481 --> 00:29:37,649
But there's nothing there.

532
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:41,612
She won't understand. She'll think
she's the one kid in the world...

533
00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:44,323
...that Santa doesn't care about.

534
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:46,367
She'll feel so...

535
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:48,994
...left out.

536
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:55,167
On Christmas night, he comes.

537
00:29:55,334 --> 00:29:58,003
Gwen can't not have a present
from Santa.

538
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:01,006
Do you know, Arthur, there is a way.

539
00:30:01,173 --> 00:30:02,799
It's impossible.

540
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:06,387
They used to say it was impossible
to teach women to read.

541
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:08,347
Follow me.

542
00:30:42,381 --> 00:30:44,466
It's the actual sleigh.

543
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:46,468
Hello, Evie.

544
00:30:46,552 --> 00:30:48,220
I thought it was scrapped years ago.

545
00:30:48,387 --> 00:30:50,138
So did everyone else.

546
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:51,432
Can I...?

547
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:57,100
Icelandic birch. Arctic balsa.
Built in 1845.

548
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:02,230
Able to reach 50,000 miles per hour
at a height of 40,000 feet.

549
00:31:02,568 --> 00:31:04,611
Over here, you string of tinsel.

550
00:31:05,529 --> 00:31:06,571
Got it.

551
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:08,407
"Potash of carboniloroxy...

552
00:31:08,824 --> 00:31:10,283
...amilocitrate."

553
00:31:11,577 --> 00:31:12,869
Magic dust.

554
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:15,831
Mined from the aurora borealis.

555
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:20,627
But she doesn't still go?

556
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,383
Not just a hobby, Arthur.

557
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:31,263
Great-great-grandchildren
of the original eight.

558
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:40,814
Dasher.

559
00:31:43,859 --> 00:31:45,193
Dancer.

560
00:31:45,444 --> 00:31:46,862
Prancer.

561
00:31:47,571 --> 00:31:52,071
What are the others called? I could
never ruddy remember. Bambi? John.

562
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:53,244
You there, with the...

563
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:54,578
...white ear. And you.

564
00:31:54,745 --> 00:31:57,622
And... Not you, you bag of fleas.

565
00:31:57,915 --> 00:31:58,916
Arthur?

566
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:01,502
I'm not really good with big animals.

567
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:02,711
Piffle!

568
00:32:02,878 --> 00:32:05,672
Don't get bit, mind.
They can smell fear.

569
00:32:05,881 --> 00:32:08,842
- Let's hitch them up.
- Oh, Grandsanta.

570
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:10,511
Excuse me.

571
00:32:12,012 --> 00:32:13,972
You can go to Gwen!

572
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:18,144
On the old sleigh, with the reindeer
and the magic dust and everything!

573
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,519
It's a miracle.

574
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,604
You're coming too, lad.

575
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,732
Me?

576
00:32:23,899 --> 00:32:27,485
On that? Up there? Pulled by them?

577
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:29,989
No. No way.

578
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:34,618
I'm 136. I can't do it on me own,
I need an elf.

579
00:32:34,785 --> 00:32:39,285
I can't fly a sleigh. I can't even
ride a bike without stabilizers.

580
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:41,125
I know, let's wake Steve. He'll...

581
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:42,334
No.

582
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:47,043
He's a worrier, Arthur. What if
he stops us? Gwen's forgotten.

583
00:32:47,673 --> 00:32:49,758
- You really care.
- Well, of course...

584
00:32:49,925 --> 00:32:53,470
...I do. I was Santa too.

585
00:32:54,388 --> 00:32:56,515
Think of your dad...

586
00:32:56,682 --> 00:32:58,308
...lying awake, chewing his...

587
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:01,020
...beard off with worry over this girl.

588
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:03,689
Don't you want to help for once?

589
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:06,066
Make him proud?

590
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,984
I can't.

591
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:11,113
I just... I can't.

592
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:13,657
No, I can't.

593
00:33:30,132 --> 00:33:31,258
Ready?!

594
00:33:32,426 --> 00:33:34,636
No! You promise...

595
00:33:34,803 --> 00:33:36,429
...not to go too fast?

596
00:33:37,014 --> 00:33:38,014
Or high.

597
00:33:40,142 --> 00:33:42,477
Or bumpy. I get travel sick.
I'm allergic to snow.

598
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:45,397
Ye baubles. And you a son of Santa?

599
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:52,695
Wait! My slippers!
They're not for outdoor use!

600
00:33:55,991 --> 00:33:57,659
Dash! Dash!

601
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:58,952
Dash!

602
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:06,710
See?

603
00:34:06,877 --> 00:34:08,461
Who's Santa now?

604
00:34:16,303 --> 00:34:17,345
Put me down!

605
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:19,389
- What's the matter, boy?
- I'm having...

606
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:20,933
...a heart attack.

607
00:34:23,769 --> 00:34:25,771
They've never flown before.

608
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,856
Just gotta break them in.

609
00:34:28,023 --> 00:34:29,357
Now...

610
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:36,740
Come away!

611
00:34:36,907 --> 00:34:38,366
Dash away!

612
00:34:51,755 --> 00:34:53,047
Look, Arthur.

613
00:34:53,799 --> 00:34:55,050
All those stars.

614
00:34:55,217 --> 00:34:56,760
We're one of them now.

615
00:34:56,927 --> 00:34:58,678
A shooting star!

616
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,100
Stuck that there for your dad
when he was a boy.

617
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,353
Dad? What, he sat here?

618
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,771
So did I.

619
00:35:07,938 --> 00:35:11,316
Every young heir to the Pole
gets took out by his father.

620
00:35:11,483 --> 00:35:14,486
Right back to Saint Nick.

621
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,865
We Clauses used to be the only men...

622
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:20,576
...in the world who could fly, Arthur...

623
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:22,369
...and see all this.

624
00:35:22,536 --> 00:35:27,036
It was a gift, a great big ball
wrapped in oceans and mountains.

625
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,878
I remember the look on your father's face
when he saw it.

626
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:10,709
Fish!

627
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:13,337
With horns!

628
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:16,381
Want to help me make a snowman?

629
00:36:16,548 --> 00:36:17,548
No! Not ye...!

630
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:21,261
Oh, where's the seat belt?

631
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:37,653
Could Dad do that?
Did he make a snowman for Steve?

632
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,196
Robot Roy'?

633
00:36:39,571 --> 00:36:40,697
I should cocoa.

634
00:36:40,864 --> 00:36:43,700
The next Santa, and he's
never even sat in a sleigh.

635
00:36:43,867 --> 00:36:45,034
Oi!

636
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:49,498
- Is that...?
- The map of the Clauses.

637
00:36:49,748 --> 00:36:52,459
Used every Christmas night in history.

638
00:36:52,751 --> 00:36:55,253
Whatever your brother says, Arthur...

639
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:58,090
...it's the same old world.

640
00:37:03,762 --> 00:37:04,554
What is it?!

641
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:05,806
No idea. I've never...

642
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:07,015
...seen it before.

643
00:37:07,182 --> 00:37:08,600
- It's a city!
- A new one?

644
00:37:08,767 --> 00:37:10,477
Ruddy cheek.
They're always putting...

645
00:37:10,644 --> 00:37:11,644
...these things up.

646
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,479
I remember the first time...

647
00:37:13,647 --> 00:37:15,649
...I ran into Chicago.

648
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:17,108
Chicago wasn't on the map?

649
00:37:19,069 --> 00:37:20,069
Now, where are we?

650
00:37:21,196 --> 00:37:22,238
Here we are, see?

651
00:37:22,948 --> 00:37:24,449
Oh, no, that's Peking.

652
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:25,950
Ahead, there's a...!

653
00:37:28,912 --> 00:37:29,912
They can see us.

654
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:32,457
Well, pull the camouflage lever.

655
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:34,334
Now, then, we'd better...

656
00:37:34,501 --> 00:37:35,543
...draw in a few...

657
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:36,920
...skyscratchers. Just...

658
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:38,630
Not that one.

659
00:37:38,797 --> 00:37:41,841
That's a steam train, you ninny.

660
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:43,009
Do this one.

661
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:45,679
So, what do they call this place?

662
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:49,558
"Toronto."

663
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:50,976
Toronto's in Canada.

664
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:53,311
The Santas always
come through Canada.

665
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:55,856
Nobody lives here.

666
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:57,023
It's nice and quiet.

667
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:00,527
Till your brother came with...

668
00:38:00,694 --> 00:38:03,571
...his "You can't cut through Saigon,
there's a war" rubbish.

669
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:05,259
Don't need him to tell me
what's ahead.

670
00:38:05,407 --> 00:38:06,491
- I got eyes.
- Grandsanta!

671
00:38:12,998 --> 00:38:13,999
Ye baubles, an elf.

672
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:15,876
Bryony Shelfley. There's...

673
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:17,753
...a small trauma to your giftwrap...

674
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,129
...but I can fix it.

675
00:38:19,296 --> 00:38:20,922
- A stowaway!
- I can wrap anything...

676
00:38:21,089 --> 00:38:24,008
...sir, with three bits of sticky tape.
Three!

677
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:25,802
Good. Wrap yourself a parachute.

678
00:38:25,969 --> 00:38:26,969
Grandsanta!

679
00:38:40,567 --> 00:38:42,610
Toronto. Present and correct.

680
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:46,406
Not quite, sir. You've lost
one of the reindeer.

681
00:38:57,417 --> 00:38:58,251
Hello?

682
00:38:58,418 --> 00:39:00,294
- What elf?
- Bryony Shelfley, sir.

683
00:39:00,462 --> 00:39:02,338
The crazy wrapping elf, you know?

684
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:06,760
Security tracked her to Sector 19.
And we think Arthur was here.

685
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:08,178
Arthur?

686
00:39:08,345 --> 00:39:10,180
Who else leaves the door open,
huh, sir?

687
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:13,141
The old sleigh barn?
That was sealed up...

688
00:39:13,308 --> 00:39:14,350
...decades ago...

689
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:18,188
...after that terrible night
Grandsanta sneaked out and...

690
00:39:18,897 --> 00:39:22,150
Thank goodness he's too old these days
to get into trouble.

691
00:39:25,362 --> 00:39:28,114
Bash it with a brick, Arthur. Go on.

692
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:30,074
It just won't...

693
00:39:30,617 --> 00:39:32,368
Grab its antlers and tug.

694
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:36,122
I may just be a wrapping operative,
sir, but this contravenes...

695
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:39,334
- Seventeen.
- Specific mission regulations.

696
00:39:39,501 --> 00:39:41,961
I'm in charge here,
not Billy the Bureaucrat.

697
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:43,130
It's stuck.

698
00:39:47,384 --> 00:39:48,384
Eighteen.

699
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:50,553
- Elf, wrap your head.
- Sir!

700
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,597
Come on, lad. You're as much use...

701
00:39:52,764 --> 00:39:54,098
...as a cheese chopstick.

702
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:56,393
Got it!

703
00:39:57,185 --> 00:39:58,186
Oh, no.

704
00:39:59,938 --> 00:40:02,273
Oh, my big Aunt Betty.

705
00:40:02,482 --> 00:40:04,442
It'll have to do. Pass it down.

706
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:05,444
What?

707
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:09,906
Permission to breathe, sir. I have about
nine seconds left before I black out.

708
00:40:10,407 --> 00:40:11,908
One breath.

709
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:14,286
Sir?

710
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:16,580
I said one. Hurry up, Arthur.

711
00:40:18,373 --> 00:40:19,791
But don't we need a whole one?

712
00:40:19,958 --> 00:40:21,334
You know...

713
00:40:21,501 --> 00:40:22,919
...to balance the sleigh?

714
00:40:23,128 --> 00:40:27,132
Oh, it won't balance the sleigh. No, no.
If anything, it'll slow us down.

715
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:30,385
So why are we taking it?

716
00:40:31,094 --> 00:40:35,389
It's for Gwen. Eight beautiful reindeer.
That's what she's dreaming of.

717
00:40:35,557 --> 00:40:37,684
The jingly bells, the sleigh on the roof.

718
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:39,936
- Yeah, but...
- That's what the kids want...

719
00:40:40,103 --> 00:40:42,271
...not some spaceship.

720
00:40:42,439 --> 00:40:44,691
We're giving her the star treatment.

721
00:40:44,858 --> 00:40:45,900
What now?

722
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:48,403
We have a waker, sir.

723
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:49,654
With a gun!

724
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:52,198
That's it, lad.

725
00:40:52,282 --> 00:40:53,074
You distract him!

726
00:40:53,241 --> 00:40:54,742
- Grandsanta!
- Who's there?

727
00:40:57,829 --> 00:41:00,081
We come in peace.

728
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:01,916
Our craft has to...

729
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:05,378
...travel around the world
in less than an hour!

730
00:41:09,007 --> 00:41:11,050
We need a sign for our slei-

731
00:41:12,135 --> 00:41:13,135
Craft.

732
00:41:14,429 --> 00:41:16,013
Sorry I can't pay you. Where I...

733
00:41:16,181 --> 00:41:17,367
...come from, we don't have...

734
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:18,975
...money!

735
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:32,864
Christmas 1923...

736
00:41:33,031 --> 00:41:36,743
...had a heart attack at the reins.
Left ventricle popped out me mouth.

737
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:38,912
Pushed it back down and carried on!

738
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:44,417
It's big, isn't it, the Atlantic?
Think we should stop and ask someone?

739
00:41:44,918 --> 00:41:47,253
Pishywibble, we're nearly there!

740
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:50,424
See, I take the North Star there...

741
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:53,926
...as a fixed point.
Then I plot my bearings from...

742
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:55,136
That's a plane, sir.

743
00:41:55,303 --> 00:41:57,805
Insubordination.
I'll have you harpooned, elf.

744
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,142
I thought it would be chillier
near England.

745
00:42:00,308 --> 00:42:01,559
Globular warming.

746
00:42:02,394 --> 00:42:06,147
Land ahoy! There it is. Told you!

747
00:42:10,944 --> 00:42:12,737
- There you are. Down.
- Watch that rock!

748
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:14,030
There you go.

749
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:21,955
England.

750
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:26,459
Maybe we pulled to the right a bit.
We're a reindeer short.

751
00:42:26,626 --> 00:42:27,710
France.

752
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:34,634
They have elephants in France?

753
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:38,471
The odd stray. They breed in the drains.
This way.

754
00:42:46,229 --> 00:42:47,855
Paris Zoo.

755
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:50,650
Then this is...

756
00:42:50,817 --> 00:42:52,109
...where they keep the lions!

757
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:54,862
They won't eat me.

758
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:57,073
I'm Santa!

759
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,240
Lie down!

760
00:42:58,283 --> 00:42:58,950
Oh, right.

761
00:42:59,117 --> 00:43:00,159
Call the keeper!

762
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:01,077
How old is this?

763
00:43:01,244 --> 00:43:02,036
"Atlantis"?

764
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:03,830
"Here be cannibals"?

765
00:43:03,997 --> 00:43:05,248
Watch out for cannibals.

766
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:09,169
This isn't France, is it?

767
00:43:09,377 --> 00:43:10,961
Technically, it's known as Africa.

768
00:43:11,129 --> 00:43:13,214
Serengeti National Park, Tanzania.

769
00:43:13,381 --> 00:43:14,965
How can you possibly be sure?

770
00:43:15,133 --> 00:43:16,217
The GPS on my HOHO.

771
00:43:16,843 --> 00:43:17,843
Take her!

772
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:18,636
Take the elf!

773
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:20,305
GPS? Why didn't you say?

774
00:43:20,472 --> 00:43:24,726
I'm a wrapping elf. I don't navigate,
I wrap. I use it to store pictures of bows.

775
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:29,272
She's right. You brought us to Africa!
I've seen it on a stamp.

776
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:33,985
I'm too young to die, Arthur.

777
00:43:34,152 --> 00:43:36,028
Do something. Arthur!

778
00:43:41,618 --> 00:43:45,121
The old sleigh.
What is happening here?

779
00:43:45,288 --> 00:43:47,915
Was supposed to be chopped up
for firewood decades ago.

780
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:50,085
- How did that devious...?
- Old people, sir.

781
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:52,712
Shall I get you your stress ball?

782
00:43:52,879 --> 00:43:53,921
We have finer...

783
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:56,174
...comms than the Pentagon,
and you say...

784
00:43:56,341 --> 00:43:58,676
...we can't contact him
except by some ancient...

785
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:02,848
Here comes the cavalry!

786
00:44:03,014 --> 00:44:04,890
Ernie Clicker, sir.

787
00:44:05,058 --> 00:44:09,558
Head of Polar Communications
for 46 missions!

788
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:12,315
Oh, crikey blikey...

789
00:44:12,482 --> 00:44:15,234
...me and your granddad
saw some times!

790
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:19,072
- I remember once...
- Wow, must catch up soon. Now...

791
00:44:19,614 --> 00:44:23,826
Oh, you're in a hurry. I can tell.

792
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:31,042
Oh, this is ridiculous.
Could we hurry this?

793
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:34,504
You can't rush the Signalator.

794
00:44:34,671 --> 00:44:36,547
Got to play her gentle.

795
00:44:37,799 --> 00:44:40,551
So, what do you wish to say?

796
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:45,181
I wouldn't worry. It's not like
they're facing man-eating lions.

797
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:51,229
Silent night Holy night

798
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:56,151
All is calm

799
00:44:58,153 --> 00:44:59,904
All is

800
00:45:00,071 --> 00:45:01,155
Bright

801
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:03,158
I realise

802
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:05,618
This is mental But it's all

803
00:45:06,369 --> 00:45:07,828
That I know

804
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:11,249
It's Christmas

805
00:45:11,416 --> 00:45:12,792
Nice kitty

806
00:45:12,959 --> 00:45:15,586
So please let us go

807
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:18,715
Sleep in

808
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:23,382
Heavenly peace

809
00:45:24,721 --> 00:45:26,889
Sleep in

810
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:30,268
Heavenly peace

811
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:42,238
Dash!

812
00:45:46,284 --> 00:45:47,952
Something's coming through.

813
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:49,537
What does it say?

814
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:56,044
Get off! No!

815
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:57,754
That's me Evie, you mangy moron!

816
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:00,590
No!

817
00:46:00,757 --> 00:46:01,924
That's Gwen's gift!

818
00:46:03,301 --> 00:46:06,178
Only children get to tear the wrapping.

819
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:07,346
Bryony?

820
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:10,141
- Automatic tape guns!
- Down, doggy!

821
00:46:10,308 --> 00:46:11,392
Bad doggy!

822
00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:13,143
Laser-guided scissors!

823
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:16,231
Oh, no, no!

824
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:19,526
Standard-issue giftwrap!

825
00:46:19,734 --> 00:46:20,484
No time for a bow!

826
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:22,445
There's always time for a bow!

827
00:46:23,863 --> 00:46:24,863
I can't look.

828
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:27,700
Not that knob!

829
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:28,660
Good night!

830
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:29,994
Oh, no!

831
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:32,247
Something else!

832
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:34,082
No, leave it! Don't...

833
00:46:36,209 --> 00:46:37,960
My camera!

834
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,392
Wait! Look!

835
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:56,146
Oi!

836
00:47:30,138 --> 00:47:31,264
What's so funny?

837
00:47:31,639 --> 00:47:33,432
Look what they've done to my Evie.

838
00:47:34,225 --> 00:47:36,602
- And the map.
- But it's okay.

839
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:37,854
We've got this. Look!

840
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:40,523
Mimosa Avenue, Trelew.

841
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:42,400
Proceed to the highlighted route.

842
00:47:42,567 --> 00:47:44,485
What's the point? Look at us.

843
00:47:44,652 --> 00:47:46,487
And my camera, totally banjaxed.

844
00:47:46,654 --> 00:47:48,739
How do I get my picture now?

845
00:47:48,948 --> 00:47:50,032
What picture?

846
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,702
The sleigh on the roof,
the eight beautiful reindeer...

847
00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:54,120
...and Santa... Me!

848
00:47:54,287 --> 00:47:56,038
...Going down the "chimbley."

849
00:47:56,539 --> 00:47:58,374
That's what I wanted them to see.

850
00:47:58,541 --> 00:48:02,127
They missed the kid, but I got there.
My way.

851
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:07,675
That's why you came. Not for Gwen.

852
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:12,764
1368 miles, then slight left.

853
00:48:14,557 --> 00:48:16,016
For the love of Lulu...

854
00:48:16,184 --> 00:48:18,644
...bossed about by Tinpot Tom.

855
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:20,062
Dash!

856
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:23,108
Try them again. Keep trying.

857
00:48:23,274 --> 00:48:25,776
All this for one child. In 600 million.

858
00:48:25,944 --> 00:48:27,946
We should turn her off a mo.

859
00:48:28,113 --> 00:48:29,823
Don't worry, sir. Children are...

860
00:48:29,989 --> 00:48:32,199
...stupid. Either it won't know
it got missed...

861
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:34,994
...or it'll think it's been bad.
It's a win-win.

862
00:48:35,161 --> 00:48:36,954
You missed one?

863
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:38,456
A nipper? Cor!

864
00:48:39,207 --> 00:48:42,460
What's all this here for
if you miss one?

865
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:44,170
Could you please type faster?

866
00:48:44,879 --> 00:48:46,255
All right.

867
00:48:47,715 --> 00:48:49,299
Systems critical.

868
00:48:49,467 --> 00:48:50,467
Lead in Christmas.

869
00:48:57,225 --> 00:48:58,601
Oops-a-daisy.

870
00:48:58,768 --> 00:49:00,060
Peter...

871
00:49:00,603 --> 00:49:02,313
...let go of my hand, please.

872
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,273
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

873
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:06,818
And get me IT.

874
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:12,365
Descend 1000 feet.

875
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:17,870
- You are at your destination.
- Yes!

876
00:49:18,037 --> 00:49:19,705
- We did it, we did it!
- We did it!

877
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:23,709
In 100 yards...

878
00:49:23,877 --> 00:49:24,877
...turn left.

879
00:49:25,378 --> 00:49:28,422
Straight ahead, left, right.
You are at your client's dwelling.

880
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:29,590
Hey, steady!

881
00:49:35,805 --> 00:49:38,015
We made it. I survived!

882
00:49:39,517 --> 00:49:43,479
I'll walk home, I'll get a boat,
but I am never getting back...

883
00:49:43,646 --> 00:49:47,399
...in that crazy flying death trap
ever again!

884
00:49:49,235 --> 00:49:50,235
Go on.

885
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,696
Get it over.

886
00:49:51,863 --> 00:49:53,155
I want my bed.

887
00:49:54,616 --> 00:49:55,908
What, you're not coming?

888
00:49:59,078 --> 00:50:00,746
You have to deliver the present.

889
00:50:01,372 --> 00:50:03,123
You've got your special coat on.

890
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:04,792
You're our Santa.

891
00:50:04,959 --> 00:50:08,045
I said me and Evie could get here,
and we did.

892
00:50:08,213 --> 00:50:10,548
The rest is just elf work.

893
00:50:10,715 --> 00:50:12,800
Go on, Festive Freddie...

894
00:50:12,967 --> 00:50:14,301
...sling your hook.

895
00:50:17,972 --> 00:50:20,349
It doesn't matter how we got here.

896
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:25,017
The sleigh on the roof, the jingle bells,
the eight reindeer.

897
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:27,857
Gwen would never have seen that.

898
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:48,586
I wish Dad could see this.

899
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:51,713
It would take such a load off his mind.

900
00:50:51,881 --> 00:50:55,009
So, what are your orders?

901
00:50:55,843 --> 00:50:58,720
You're a Claus.
You give the orders.

902
00:50:58,888 --> 00:51:00,097
Do I?

903
00:51:01,724 --> 00:51:05,060
I'm just happy being an elf, really.
You know, just part of it all.

904
00:51:06,729 --> 00:51:08,939
You want to order me
to go through the cat flap?

905
00:51:10,024 --> 00:51:11,191
Yes, that's a great idea.

906
00:51:13,152 --> 00:51:15,279
Do you want to tell me to let you in?

907
00:51:15,446 --> 00:51:17,322
Brilliant. Thank you, Bryony.

908
00:51:19,492 --> 00:51:20,618
And do you want to...?

909
00:51:20,785 --> 00:51:23,204
- Quick!
- The alarm? Definitely, yes.

910
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:56,654
Is this...

911
00:51:56,821 --> 00:51:58,030
...your first time?

912
00:52:18,134 --> 00:52:19,301
But...

913
00:52:28,436 --> 00:52:29,478
Bryony?

914
00:52:35,443 --> 00:52:36,110
Sorry.

915
00:52:36,277 --> 00:52:39,071
He likes these slippers
even more than you do!

916
00:52:46,245 --> 00:52:47,663
Happy Christmas.

917
00:52:49,582 --> 00:52:51,292
When you put the address into...

918
00:52:51,459 --> 00:52:52,835
...the HOHO, what did you see?

919
00:52:53,002 --> 00:52:55,713
A list of Trelews.
I just clicked on the first one!

920
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:58,465
Which was not Trelew, England.

921
00:52:58,633 --> 00:53:00,718
We're in the wrong Trelew!

922
00:53:06,724 --> 00:53:08,183
What's going on?!

923
00:53:09,018 --> 00:53:12,062
They've been watching us.
They've seen Evie.

924
00:53:12,438 --> 00:53:15,315
- It's just like last time.
- Governments tonight...

925
00:53:15,483 --> 00:53:18,777
...are waking to news of a UFO
travelling the globe at incredible speed.

926
00:53:18,945 --> 00:53:20,196
- That's us!
- The clearest...

927
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:22,531
...sighting was at
this tractor dealership...

928
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:24,617
- ...in Idaho.
- Had eyeballs on its feet...

929
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:28,412
...and a pointy little head.
It asked me for a sign.

930
00:53:28,621 --> 00:53:30,873
- We're on the news.
- From the trail in Toronto...

931
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,917
- ...these beings do not appear friendly.
- Rebooting.

932
00:53:34,919 --> 00:53:36,420
- We are online, sir.
- This is...

933
00:53:36,587 --> 00:53:37,713
...Charlotte. Mexican...

934
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:39,040
police found a furry thing...

935
00:53:39,173 --> 00:53:41,093
- ...trying to mate with a dog.
- I have calls...

936
00:53:41,217 --> 00:53:44,803
- ...reporting a steam train flying around.
- Steam train? Been on the eggnog?

937
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:47,598
It's gone black over Mexico.
This thing's going faster...

938
00:53:47,765 --> 00:53:49,141
...than anything we know of.

939
00:53:49,308 --> 00:53:51,184
- No.
- The herd is now in...

940
00:53:51,352 --> 00:53:54,021
...Mozambique 's airspace,
threatening the fragile peace...

941
00:53:54,188 --> 00:53:55,439
...between the two nations.

942
00:53:55,648 --> 00:53:59,026
Two billion items delivered, and we
didn't leave a footprint in the snow.

943
00:53:59,193 --> 00:54:00,360
- And now...
- Sir?

944
00:54:00,528 --> 00:54:03,113
We have lost 80 percent of our data.

945
00:54:03,322 --> 00:54:05,073
No, no. We have 18 pulse...

946
00:54:05,241 --> 00:54:09,578
- ...data reservoirs of a trillion terabytes!
- Sorry, autosave was off.

947
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:11,456
Shall I slap him, sir? Quite hard?

948
00:54:11,622 --> 00:54:12,289
Sir...

949
00:54:12,457 --> 00:54:14,709
...there's a polar bear on Level 6.

950
00:54:14,876 --> 00:54:16,794
Sir? Why is Arthur out there?

951
00:54:18,129 --> 00:54:19,296
He missed one.

952
00:54:19,464 --> 00:54:20,506
A nipper.

953
00:54:21,048 --> 00:54:22,132
I mean...

954
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:24,677
...47785BXK.

955
00:54:28,097 --> 00:54:29,848
Sir, we've got something.

956
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:32,560
Bryony Shelfley, it's her HOHO.

957
00:54:37,273 --> 00:54:38,565
We can still get there.

958
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:42,069
- We just have to go faster, higher!
- You've changed your tune.

959
00:54:42,236 --> 00:54:43,236
I'm not going anywhere.

960
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:44,863
I'm not here!

961
00:54:45,072 --> 00:54:47,282
I've taped myself in! Grandsanta!

962
00:54:47,575 --> 00:54:48,742
Leave me. It's that...

963
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:50,536
...terrible night all over again.

964
00:54:50,703 --> 00:54:51,703
What night?

965
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:53,372
Last time I took Evie for a spin.

966
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:54,540
I didn't know...

967
00:54:54,707 --> 00:54:58,502
...it was the Cuban missile crisis!
I nearly started World War Ill.

968
00:55:00,546 --> 00:55:02,381
Hold still. Someone has to drive.

969
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:06,219
Oh, no!

970
00:55:06,427 --> 00:55:07,136
Fencer!

971
00:55:07,303 --> 00:55:08,387
Mincer! Come back!

972
00:55:10,097 --> 00:55:11,097
Bryony!

973
00:55:16,187 --> 00:55:16,979
Grandsanta...

974
00:55:17,146 --> 00:55:17,813
"Get here!

975
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:20,440
Oi! That's me new hip.

976
00:55:20,691 --> 00:55:23,402
Please, I'll read you Gwen's letter.

977
00:55:23,569 --> 00:55:25,904
Stone-deaf. I'm 136.

978
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:27,865
- What's that?
- It's Steve.

979
00:55:28,032 --> 00:55:29,116
- Steve!
- Tell him...

980
00:55:29,283 --> 00:55:30,117
...I'm not here!

981
00:55:30,284 --> 00:55:32,536
Grandsanta says he's not here.

982
00:55:32,703 --> 00:55:35,455
Hi. I 'm looking for a missing relic.

983
00:55:35,623 --> 00:55:37,124
Steve, three words.

984
00:55:37,291 --> 00:55:38,792
- Is the first one "help"?
- Yes.

985
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,628
- You can help us, Steve!
- It was him!

986
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:42,922
Frosty the Madman.
He forced me to come.

987
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:44,840
Elf, back me up if you want a career.

988
00:55:45,007 --> 00:55:47,300
- I forced you?
- You see? Look.

989
00:55:47,468 --> 00:55:49,803
What did you want, Grandsanta?
Let me guess.

990
00:55:49,971 --> 00:55:52,598
A picture of you in the sleigh
delivering the gift...

991
00:55:52,765 --> 00:55:54,850
...to show me how it's really done?

992
00:55:55,017 --> 00:55:55,684
No.

993
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:57,854
You know the picture
they'll have tomorrow?

994
00:55:58,020 --> 00:55:59,730
You, led away in handcuffs!

995
00:55:59,897 --> 00:56:02,900
The Santa who was seen.
By everybody on Earth.

996
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:05,069
The Santa who ruined Christmas.

997
00:56:05,236 --> 00:56:06,236
Ruined it!

998
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:10,407
We'll fix this, Steve. We'll be back home
in the wobble of a reindeer's buttocks.

999
00:56:10,575 --> 00:56:14,412
And Evie can go back in mothballs.
You can forget she ever existed.

1000
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:17,582
You can't just go home.
What about Gwen?

1001
00:56:17,748 --> 00:56:20,709
Gwen. For that, you'd threaten
my whole operation?

1002
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:24,171
Steve, you said if there was any way
to get there, you would.

1003
00:56:24,338 --> 00:56:25,881
Well, this is it. Look.

1004
00:56:26,048 --> 00:56:27,382
The old sleigh is perfect!

1005
00:56:28,175 --> 00:56:31,887
Right. Well, anyway, it goes really fast,
even with bits missing.

1006
00:56:32,054 --> 00:56:34,139
And we've got quite a few
reindeer left.

1007
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:36,976
And, if I 'm sick again,
I could be sick in a bag.

1008
00:56:37,143 --> 00:56:38,727
I'll wrap him one.

1009
00:56:39,312 --> 00:56:40,312
We can help them.

1010
00:56:40,396 --> 00:56:41,522
No one missed, sir!

1011
00:56:41,689 --> 00:56:43,565
All correct presents,
present and correct.

1012
00:56:44,483 --> 00:56:46,401
If you help us, Steve...

1013
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:47,861
...we can do it!

1014
00:56:52,992 --> 00:56:54,535
Grandsanta and Arthur would be...

1015
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:56,870
...the heroes of the night, sir!

1016
00:56:59,498 --> 00:57:01,291
Come home now!

1017
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:03,002
If we all just gave in...

1018
00:57:03,169 --> 00:57:05,129
...to Christmas spirit, there'd be chaos.

1019
00:57:05,421 --> 00:57:07,673
- We 're on our way, Steve.
- No!

1020
00:57:08,174 --> 00:57:10,134
Santa will want us to get to Gwen.

1021
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:12,344
Ask him. Please.

1022
00:57:12,511 --> 00:57:13,553
Arthur...

1023
00:57:14,513 --> 00:57:16,973
...this is Dad we're talking about.

1024
00:57:17,141 --> 00:57:20,978
There was a time when he cared about
every last gift tag, but now...

1025
00:57:21,145 --> 00:57:24,356
...he just wants to be loved
and get some rest.

1026
00:57:25,274 --> 00:57:29,774
No. He's lying awake,
worrying his beard off about Gwen.

1027
00:57:32,907 --> 00:57:34,241
Off to the land of nod.

1028
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:37,369
Please do not disturb
until December 26th.

1029
00:57:37,536 --> 00:57:38,703
- Is that it, dear?
- Yes.

1030
00:57:38,871 --> 00:57:39,913
Press the red...

1031
00:57:41,999 --> 00:57:43,041
No.

1032
00:57:43,668 --> 00:57:46,253
Santa's the most caring man
in the world.

1033
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:50,006
So why are you here, not him?

1034
00:58:13,364 --> 00:58:15,074
Don't leave me, Arthur!

1035
00:58:15,282 --> 00:58:19,536
Poor old man and his reindeer,
on our own at Christmas?

1036
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:23,916
At least have the decency
to finish us off with a rock!

1037
00:58:59,326 --> 00:59:01,119
Poor Evie.

1038
00:59:04,498 --> 00:59:06,458
Sun'll be up soon.

1039
00:59:06,625 --> 00:59:08,501
It's Christmas!

1040
00:59:09,128 --> 00:59:12,422
Christmas is for kids.
You grow out of it.

1041
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:14,258
What, in the last six minutes?

1042
00:59:15,301 --> 00:59:18,053
I know what you all say about me,
you know.

1043
00:59:19,305 --> 00:59:22,016
"He belongs in the South Pole."

1044
00:59:22,516 --> 00:59:26,561
"Dear Arthur, what a puzzle."

1045
00:59:28,272 --> 00:59:29,815
Well, you were right.

1046
00:59:30,483 --> 00:59:33,235
All that fuss over one kid.

1047
00:59:33,402 --> 00:59:36,029
I was being ridiculous.

1048
00:59:37,656 --> 00:59:39,449
This is nice.

1049
00:59:39,617 --> 00:59:42,453
It's good to get away from it all,
you know.

1050
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:44,622
All the Christmas fuss.

1051
00:59:52,838 --> 00:59:56,466
I'm sorry I messed things up, lad.

1052
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:58,093
You see...

1053
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:01,930
...the night I last took Evie out...

1054
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:05,184
...when there was all that fuss...

1055
01:00:05,392 --> 01:00:07,477
...your father came to me.

1056
01:00:07,645 --> 01:00:09,313
I'll never forget it.

1057
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,565
Couldn't look me in the eye.

1058
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:13,984
"Dad," he says.

1059
01:00:14,401 --> 01:00:17,946
"Steve thinks it best
you don't fly again.

1060
01:00:19,323 --> 01:00:22,034
We're scrapping the sleigh."

1061
01:00:22,993 --> 01:00:25,078
Me own son...

1062
01:00:25,746 --> 01:00:28,707
...who used to sit where you sat,
looking up at me.

1063
01:00:31,752 --> 01:00:34,963
I just wanted them to remember...

1064
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:37,341
...who I used to be.

1065
01:00:39,343 --> 01:00:43,843
I was a bit like you, lad.
Keen as cranberry.

1066
01:00:44,306 --> 01:00:46,641
So was your dad.

1067
01:00:47,268 --> 01:00:49,228
You get old, that's all.

1068
01:00:49,395 --> 01:00:52,272
Everything changes.

1069
01:00:52,439 --> 01:00:53,815
Does it?

1070
01:00:55,568 --> 01:01:00,068
How can I ever write another letter
saying that Santa cares?

1071
01:01:08,372 --> 01:01:09,956
Good night, Dad.

1072
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,418
Sleep well.

1073
01:01:21,510 --> 01:01:25,096
Sir, we know you shouldn't believe
rumours, but we do.

1074
01:01:25,264 --> 01:01:27,015
Is it true you missed a child?

1075
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:29,351
Me? No, no, no.

1076
01:01:29,518 --> 01:01:31,937
Well, in a way, yes.

1077
01:01:33,814 --> 01:01:35,065
It was just one.

1078
01:01:35,232 --> 01:01:37,067
In fact, not even that.

1079
01:01:37,234 --> 01:01:39,277
Nought point lots more noughts...

1080
01:01:39,445 --> 01:01:42,156
...then a number
and some sort of percent at the end.

1081
01:01:42,323 --> 01:01:45,617
Not really an error, just a one.

1082
01:01:45,784 --> 01:01:48,411
One child doesn't matter? Which one?

1083
01:01:48,579 --> 01:01:49,997
Well, I... It's not that...

1084
01:01:50,164 --> 01:01:51,999
I did nine ones in Greece.

1085
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:53,846
- Did those matter?
- What about my ones...

1086
01:01:53,918 --> 01:01:56,086
...in Germany? One of them was twins!

1087
01:01:56,253 --> 01:01:58,004
They don't matter half each.

1088
01:01:58,672 --> 01:02:02,467
Why don't you ask Steve?
He can explain. Fiendishly clever.

1089
01:02:02,635 --> 01:02:04,720
But aren't you in charge, sir?

1090
01:02:05,262 --> 01:02:08,765
Of course. I'm Santa.

1091
01:02:08,933 --> 01:02:09,767
Sir...

1092
01:02:09,934 --> 01:02:12,937
...if the one that got missed
doesn't matter...

1093
01:02:13,103 --> 01:02:15,897
...why have Arthur and Grandsanta
gone to take it?

1094
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:20,690
- What?
- Malcolm, what's this about Arthur?

1095
01:02:23,113 --> 01:02:24,114
He's crazy.

1096
01:02:24,281 --> 01:02:26,491
Is there a list of children
who don't matter?

1097
01:02:26,659 --> 01:02:28,786
Santa said they don't matter
100 percent.

1098
01:02:28,953 --> 01:02:31,830
Is it true children aren't real,
they're just antimatter?

1099
01:02:32,831 --> 01:02:34,249
Do not... Look. Look!

1100
01:02:34,416 --> 01:02:38,086
I festivized every single country
in the world. You see?

1101
01:02:38,254 --> 01:02:40,756
This one, this one, this one.
All of them.

1102
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:44,134
I mean, who cares about
one single tiny child?

1103
01:02:48,055 --> 01:02:49,139
I do.

1104
01:02:50,057 --> 01:02:51,475
Arthur.

1105
01:02:51,725 --> 01:02:53,852
My poor boy.

1106
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:55,979
Why on earth would he...?

1107
01:02:56,689 --> 01:03:00,150
You're his brother, Steve.
How could you let him?

1108
01:03:00,609 --> 01:03:04,321
And about this child you missed...

1109
01:03:04,488 --> 01:03:07,157
...I'm really not sure
you made the right decision.

1110
01:03:09,535 --> 01:03:11,954
Is that bird doo on your shoulder?

1111
01:03:12,705 --> 01:03:13,914
Right.

1112
01:03:14,081 --> 01:03:15,540
Over there is Satellite...

1113
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:18,168
...Tracking, Navigation, Data Analysis.

1114
01:03:18,335 --> 01:03:22,339
Coffee machine's by the door.
Good night, Santa.

1115
01:03:35,352 --> 01:03:36,978
I'll be right back.

1116
01:04:15,684 --> 01:04:17,602
Dear Xiao-Ling,
thanks for your letter...

1117
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:19,980
...and drawing of Santa
tripping over your dog.

1118
01:04:20,147 --> 01:04:21,189
It was hilarious.

1119
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:22,357
Dear Alessandro...

1120
01:04:22,483 --> 01:04:26,612
...I'm sorry your family's
had a hard year, but Santa is real.

1121
01:04:26,779 --> 01:04:31,116
Dear Lars, I promise Santa will come.

1122
01:04:31,283 --> 01:04:33,868
He's the greatest man ever.

1123
01:04:52,721 --> 01:04:54,889
- Can I burn this?
- Sure.

1124
01:04:55,808 --> 01:04:57,643
There's millions like it.

1125
01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:21,500
This picture.

1126
01:05:21,792 --> 01:05:23,960
This drawing!

1127
01:05:24,962 --> 01:05:26,880
It isn't of Dad...

1128
01:05:27,756 --> 01:05:28,756
...or you...

1129
01:05:29,174 --> 01:05:30,508
...or Steve.

1130
01:05:32,719 --> 01:05:34,554
This is Santa!

1131
01:05:36,265 --> 01:05:40,765
And as long we get the bike to Gwen
before she wakes up, then Santa came!

1132
01:05:42,312 --> 01:05:44,355
And he cares!

1133
01:05:50,571 --> 01:05:51,780
Excuse!

1134
01:05:51,947 --> 01:05:53,615
Jingle bells, jingle bells

1135
01:05:53,782 --> 01:05:55,366
Jingle all the way

1136
01:05:55,534 --> 01:05:56,826
Oh, what fun it is to reach

1137
01:05:56,994 --> 01:05:58,453
Gwen Hines on Christmas Day

1138
01:06:02,374 --> 01:06:03,792
Jingle Bells This boat smells

1139
01:06:05,544 --> 01:06:07,379
Three thousand miles to go

1140
01:06:08,422 --> 01:06:09,714
Oh, dear.

1141
01:06:10,090 --> 01:06:13,843
I've seen this before.
Sleigh fever, they call it.

1142
01:06:14,011 --> 01:06:16,888
Pressure of Christmas
sends a man doolally-tap.

1143
01:06:17,055 --> 01:06:19,974
Santa Claus XVI got it, 1802.

1144
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:23,145
Every child that year got a sausage
nailed to a piece of bark.

1145
01:06:24,980 --> 01:06:29,480
Arthur, do you really think you can
row the Atlantic Ocean in the next...

1146
01:06:29,735 --> 01:06:31,403
- ...37 minutes?
- It's not...

1147
01:06:31,987 --> 01:06:34,572
...too late yet.

1148
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:37,909
I just have to keep going.

1149
01:06:38,076 --> 01:06:41,496
We need a blunt instrument.
Knock him out and regroup.

1150
01:06:41,663 --> 01:06:46,163
Make a legal U-turn,
then slight right in 4228 miles.

1151
01:06:46,627 --> 01:06:49,046
You do know
we're going round in circles?

1152
01:06:49,671 --> 01:06:54,171
You know, we're not the only ones.
Maybe I will see Evie again.

1153
01:06:54,927 --> 01:06:56,637
- What do you mean?
- Reindeer are...

1154
01:06:56,803 --> 01:06:58,387
...brave, powerful beasts...

1155
01:06:58,555 --> 01:07:01,683
...but they're also dappled cretins
with twigs on their heads.

1156
01:07:01,850 --> 01:07:06,350
They'll just keep going in a straight line
right round the world.

1157
01:07:06,605 --> 01:07:08,898
They'll be way up in the sky, flying...

1158
01:07:09,066 --> 01:07:11,610
...at unimaginable speed,
but they'll pass...

1159
01:07:11,777 --> 01:07:13,779
- ...right over our heads.
- Great!

1160
01:07:13,946 --> 01:07:15,656
We can get the sleigh back!

1161
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:20,660
Chief De Silva.

1162
01:07:20,911 --> 01:07:23,914
- Where is this UFO?
- It's circling the Earth, ma'am.

1163
01:07:24,081 --> 01:07:26,708
Nineteen minutes ago,
it went into orbit.

1164
01:07:27,543 --> 01:07:31,046
You? Up there? Catch that with this?

1165
01:07:32,047 --> 01:07:33,048
Magic dust.

1166
01:07:33,215 --> 01:07:34,758
You crack it over your head.

1167
01:07:34,925 --> 01:07:38,845
You'll have to focus. The sleigh'll be
coming at you at 45,000 miles an hour.

1168
01:07:39,012 --> 01:07:40,763
- 45,000...?
- You'll be torn...

1169
01:07:40,931 --> 01:07:41,973
...in half!

1170
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:45,601
Depends on the angle the sleigh hits.
You might just get beheaded.

1171
01:07:45,769 --> 01:07:50,269
I've got a phobia of being beheaded,
and heights and speed and reindeer...

1172
01:07:51,191 --> 01:07:52,275
...and buttons.

1173
01:07:52,526 --> 01:07:53,568
Buttons?

1174
01:07:53,735 --> 01:07:55,695
Yeah, I'm pretty much scared
of everything.

1175
01:07:55,862 --> 01:07:58,364
Gwen thinks you're coming.

1176
01:07:59,199 --> 01:08:00,700
You can't do this. Yes, you can!

1177
01:08:00,867 --> 01:08:03,369
No, you can't. Yes, you can!
Come on, Arthur!

1178
01:08:03,537 --> 01:08:05,330
Don't worry. Only a raving lunatic...

1179
01:08:05,497 --> 01:08:08,458
I have to worry!
It's the only thing I'm good at!

1180
01:08:09,126 --> 01:08:10,168
Worry me.

1181
01:08:10,335 --> 01:08:11,961
The sleigh'll be back any minute.

1182
01:08:12,129 --> 01:08:13,755
Come on. Worry me, quickly!

1183
01:08:14,798 --> 01:08:17,342
Imagine Gwen, all alone...

1184
01:08:17,509 --> 01:08:20,011
- ...nothing under the tree.
- Here we go.

1185
01:08:21,471 --> 01:08:22,847
No! Don't like this! Stop! Stop!

1186
01:08:23,015 --> 01:08:23,849
Get me down!

1187
01:08:24,016 --> 01:08:25,696
The tears as she finds
she's been left out.

1188
01:08:26,268 --> 01:08:28,353
Screaming, "Santa didn't come!"

1189
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:29,521
Oh, Gwen.

1190
01:08:29,688 --> 01:08:31,481
No! It's just...

1191
01:08:31,648 --> 01:08:33,775
- ...too high!
- Gwen in the street...

1192
01:08:33,984 --> 01:08:36,069
...surrounded by kids
on new bikes, pointing:

1193
01:08:36,486 --> 01:08:39,322
"That's the girl that Santa hates!"

1194
01:08:39,489 --> 01:08:43,618
She runs away, alcoholic by the age
of 9. Dead before she's even...!

1195
01:08:43,785 --> 01:08:46,370
She may never build
a snowman again!

1196
01:08:47,748 --> 01:08:50,792
What if there are buttons on the sleigh
I don't know about?!

1197
01:08:51,001 --> 01:08:53,003
Here it is!

1198
01:09:12,522 --> 01:09:14,190
How do you think he's...?

1199
01:09:14,358 --> 01:09:17,694
Fine, fine. Probably just...

1200
01:09:32,334 --> 01:09:35,670
So how come they didn't
scrap the sleigh, sir?

1201
01:09:35,837 --> 01:09:39,757
I threatened the elves.
Said I'd feed them to the polar bears.

1202
01:09:51,311 --> 01:09:55,811
Elf, how do you fancy being the one
to tell his parents about all this?

1203
01:10:30,517 --> 01:10:31,559
Arthur!

1204
01:10:31,727 --> 01:10:33,603
- You did it!
- I did it With Worry!

1205
01:10:33,770 --> 01:10:36,314
Oh, I was sure you'd die. It was great!

1206
01:10:36,523 --> 01:10:38,483
Proceed to the highlighted route.

1207
01:10:38,650 --> 01:10:40,443
Proceed to the highlighted...

1208
01:10:41,945 --> 01:10:44,280
Just keep worrying about Gwen.

1209
01:10:44,448 --> 01:10:47,534
I'll find a way there, boy.
Whatever it takes.

1210
01:10:47,951 --> 01:10:49,661
To Trelew!

1211
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:54,374
Margaret.

1212
01:10:54,541 --> 01:10:56,417
Hand me my Me suit.

1213
01:10:56,585 --> 01:10:58,253
All sorted. Steve's...

1214
01:10:58,420 --> 01:10:59,671
...holding the fort...

1215
01:10:59,838 --> 01:11:02,632
...while I deliver the present, yes...

1216
01:11:02,799 --> 01:11:04,592
...and find Arthur and Father.

1217
01:11:04,926 --> 01:11:06,010
Well done, dear.

1218
01:11:06,178 --> 01:11:09,890
Trelew's on a course of 187.7 degrees
from the geographic pole...

1219
01:11:10,056 --> 01:11:11,766
...but as it's the old sleigh...

1220
01:11:11,933 --> 01:11:14,560
...allow a drift margin
of 1000 miles either side...

1221
01:11:14,728 --> 01:11:17,063
...of the meridian.
Got a sweater for Arthur...

1222
01:11:17,230 --> 01:11:18,397
...your father's pills...

1223
01:11:18,565 --> 01:11:20,441
...and some nice sweet tea.

1224
01:11:26,907 --> 01:11:28,033
Curtains.

1225
01:11:31,119 --> 01:11:32,703
- S-1 dented.
- Sir. Sir!

1226
01:11:32,871 --> 01:11:33,538
Big scratch...

1227
01:11:33,705 --> 01:11:34,705
...down side.

1228
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:37,042
"Popped out to take present.

1229
01:11:37,375 --> 01:11:39,335
Turkey sandwich in fridge.
Mum and Dad."

1230
01:11:39,503 --> 01:11:40,837
Espresso machine broken.

1231
01:11:41,004 --> 01:11:43,297
That idiot, Arthur. He's sent...

1232
01:11:43,465 --> 01:11:44,924
...everyone crazy.

1233
01:11:45,091 --> 01:11:46,425
He'll destroy Christmas.

1234
01:11:46,593 --> 01:11:49,095
And you'll never get to be Santa.

1235
01:11:50,347 --> 01:11:52,265
Steven!

1236
01:11:54,267 --> 01:11:57,311
23 Mimosa Avenue, Trelew.

1237
01:11:58,230 --> 01:11:58,897
Malcolm...

1238
01:11:59,064 --> 01:12:01,357
...there's no harm in using a manual.

1239
01:12:01,525 --> 01:12:04,277
- Men.
- Margaret, I order you to disembark.

1240
01:12:04,444 --> 01:12:05,736
It's not safe.

1241
01:12:05,904 --> 01:12:08,948
Piffle. I did a microlight flying course
on the Internet.

1242
01:12:09,115 --> 01:12:11,033
It can't be that different.

1243
01:12:12,828 --> 01:12:13,870
Steve.

1244
01:12:14,746 --> 01:12:17,623
You've dented it!
You take it out without asking?

1245
01:12:17,791 --> 01:12:19,626
Malcolm, you told me he knew.

1246
01:12:19,793 --> 01:12:21,836
You know how Steve feels
about his S-1.

1247
01:12:22,003 --> 01:12:24,422
It's my S-1. S for "Santa."

1248
01:12:24,589 --> 01:12:26,591
I'm flying to this child.

1249
01:12:26,758 --> 01:12:30,219
Of course she's all that matters.
Not me, your son.

1250
01:12:30,387 --> 01:12:34,015
Not the 2 billion things
I did right tonight. No!

1251
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:37,393
This is about that pool table, isn't it?

1252
01:12:37,561 --> 01:12:40,272
I told you, you should've written to me.

1253
01:12:40,438 --> 01:12:42,731
I was 8. You're my dad!

1254
01:12:42,899 --> 01:12:43,941
For goodness sake!

1255
01:12:44,109 --> 01:12:46,027
Arthur and Grandsanta are out there...

1256
01:12:46,194 --> 01:12:48,362
...probably not wearing
nearly enough layers...

1257
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:51,366
...and you two are bickering over
a big red toy?!

1258
01:12:51,533 --> 01:12:53,493
I'm not bickering.
If Steven could just...

1259
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:54,660
...stand back...

1260
01:12:54,911 --> 01:12:56,203
Air bag.

1261
01:13:02,669 --> 01:13:04,545
You drive, Steven.

1262
01:13:05,171 --> 01:13:06,213
Thank you.

1263
01:13:06,381 --> 01:13:10,051
So since gift delivery
to child 47785BXK...

1264
01:13:10,218 --> 01:13:11,552
...is all that seems...

1265
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:13,179
...to matter...

1266
01:13:13,346 --> 01:13:14,472
...I’ll do it myself.

1267
01:13:14,639 --> 01:13:18,309
Then we'll pick up Arthur and Grandsanta
from whatever ditch they ended up in.

1268
01:13:18,602 --> 01:13:19,978
Maximum thrust.

1269
01:13:25,233 --> 01:13:27,902
When Santa said he'd be right back...

1270
01:13:28,069 --> 01:13:29,862
...what do you think he...?

1271
01:13:30,030 --> 01:13:31,990
He's not coming back!

1272
01:13:32,157 --> 01:13:33,575
The Santas are leaving!

1273
01:13:33,742 --> 01:13:34,784
Children don't matter?

1274
01:13:34,951 --> 01:13:36,327
Christmas doesn't matter!

1275
01:13:36,494 --> 01:13:37,244
Nothing matters!

1276
01:13:37,412 --> 01:13:40,081
It's like 1816!

1277
01:13:40,248 --> 01:13:41,248
Abandon the North Pole!

1278
01:13:41,291 --> 01:13:43,334
- Everybody, panic!
- Are you sure you want...

1279
01:13:43,501 --> 01:13:44,752
...to delete Christmas?

1280
01:13:45,629 --> 01:13:46,713
Meltdown: 10 minutes.

1281
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:49,257
- Head south!
- It's all south from here, you fool!

1282
01:13:51,801 --> 01:13:53,511
I know where we can find...

1283
01:13:53,678 --> 01:13:54,679
...a map, lad!

1284
01:13:56,556 --> 01:13:57,223
A bit...

1285
01:13:57,390 --> 01:13:58,390
...risky, this.

1286
01:14:00,352 --> 01:14:02,937
Breaking the rules,
even in the old days.

1287
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:25,126
There!

1288
01:14:25,335 --> 01:14:27,795
Biggest map in the world!

1289
01:14:32,509 --> 01:14:33,510
Dash!

1290
01:14:36,137 --> 01:14:39,515
Friends, on this night of peace,
we stand confronted...

1291
01:14:39,683 --> 01:14:41,351
...by an unknown danger.

1292
01:14:41,518 --> 01:14:44,687
Aliens. Aliens from space.

1293
01:14:44,896 --> 01:14:47,523
- Blast them from the skies!
- Let us do an autopsy.

1294
01:14:47,691 --> 01:14:49,818
But maybe the aliens come in peace?

1295
01:14:49,985 --> 01:14:51,065
They burst an inflatable...

1296
01:14:51,111 --> 01:14:53,571
...Santa Claus in Toronto.
On Christmas night!

1297
01:14:53,780 --> 01:14:56,282
- What a terrible thing.
- Let us attempt contact...

1298
01:14:56,533 --> 01:14:59,619
...but be ready to save our planet.

1299
01:15:01,663 --> 01:15:04,207
Hold tight, lad. This is where it gets...

1300
01:15:04,374 --> 01:15:05,416
...really rough.

1301
01:15:18,346 --> 01:15:19,680
Not now...

1302
01:15:19,848 --> 01:15:21,057
...you sack of antlers.

1303
01:15:30,483 --> 01:15:31,650
Alert level six.

1304
01:15:31,818 --> 01:15:33,736
It's coming down through
the atmosphere.

1305
01:15:33,903 --> 01:15:34,903
We'll see it.

1306
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:36,364
Forty-six, 45...

1307
01:15:38,033 --> 01:15:39,034
...44, 43...

1308
01:15:39,242 --> 01:15:42,245
They'll be waiting for us, sir.
We were on the news.

1309
01:15:42,412 --> 01:15:46,290
All their technology against my Evie.

1310
01:15:46,458 --> 01:15:49,210
Oh, come on. Let's do it with worry!

1311
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:53,214
Santa mustn't be seen, eh, lad?

1312
01:15:53,381 --> 01:15:54,632
Let's give them...

1313
01:15:54,799 --> 01:15:55,966
...something to shoot at.

1314
01:15:57,218 --> 01:15:58,344
We have visual.

1315
01:15:58,511 --> 01:15:59,678
Here it comes.

1316
01:16:01,639 --> 01:16:03,432
Take us to your leader.

1317
01:16:04,768 --> 01:16:05,768
England!

1318
01:16:06,478 --> 01:16:07,770
No sign of anyone.

1319
01:16:07,937 --> 01:16:10,522
- The sun's coming up!
- Come on, lad! You can...

1320
01:16:10,690 --> 01:16:12,066
...do it! Move your hooves!

1321
01:16:12,650 --> 01:16:14,568
Mankind greets you. Do you copy?

1322
01:16:14,778 --> 01:16:17,614
Season's greetings from mankind.
Good morning, do you copy?

1323
01:16:17,822 --> 01:16:20,032
The hull is some kind of
woody substance, ma'am.

1324
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:21,743
Like wood.

1325
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:23,786
Coated in lead paint.

1326
01:16:23,953 --> 01:16:25,287
The engine seems to be alive.

1327
01:16:25,455 --> 01:16:27,123
And furry.

1328
01:16:27,582 --> 01:16:29,083
Come on, lad!

1329
01:16:29,250 --> 01:16:30,459
Put your back...

1330
01:16:30,627 --> 01:16:31,627
...into it!

1331
01:16:39,719 --> 01:16:42,638
I have something. It's very faint but...

1332
01:16:42,806 --> 01:16:43,806
Scramble drone.

1333
01:16:47,018 --> 01:16:48,561
That's it, there!

1334
01:16:48,728 --> 01:16:49,895
We made it!

1335
01:16:52,107 --> 01:16:53,691
Not quite.

1336
01:16:53,858 --> 01:16:54,858
Dash!

1337
01:16:58,029 --> 01:17:00,031
It's right up me steam pipe!

1338
01:17:00,532 --> 01:17:03,785
- It's tracking something electronic!
- We haven't got...

1339
01:17:03,952 --> 01:17:06,079
...any "electrickery." Just wood...

1340
01:17:06,287 --> 01:17:07,329
...and brass and...

1341
01:17:07,497 --> 01:17:08,581
Oh, dear.

1342
01:17:08,748 --> 01:17:10,416
- Your Slipper!
- Your Slipper!

1343
01:17:11,167 --> 01:17:12,168
We have lock.

1344
01:17:12,794 --> 01:17:14,462
We got to get you down there, lad.

1345
01:17:14,629 --> 01:17:16,881
- They'll see us! We'll be stopped!
- Give me that.

1346
01:17:17,382 --> 01:17:20,301
- What are you doing?
- It's Evie they're after.

1347
01:17:20,468 --> 01:17:24,346
She doesn't fit this world, Arthur.
She's a relic.

1348
01:17:24,514 --> 01:17:25,306
Evie?

1349
01:17:25,473 --> 01:17:29,435
I always knew she'd be needed
one more time.

1350
01:17:29,936 --> 01:17:32,813
You go on. We'll let them have her.

1351
01:17:32,981 --> 01:17:34,399
You're coming too.

1352
01:17:34,566 --> 01:17:39,066
You were right, Arthur. It doesn't matter
how Santa's gift gets there.

1353
01:17:39,445 --> 01:17:41,530
Doesn't even matter if it's...

1354
01:17:41,698 --> 01:17:45,118
- ...Mr. Postman in his spaceship.
- As long as it gets there.

1355
01:17:45,285 --> 01:17:48,913
You made it happen, lad.
No one got left out.

1356
01:17:49,205 --> 01:17:50,539
Get off.

1357
01:17:50,707 --> 01:17:52,083
Now, do as I say.

1358
01:17:53,084 --> 01:17:54,085
They're firing on us!

1359
01:17:54,252 --> 01:17:56,087
- A death ray!
- Made of chocolate...

1360
01:17:56,254 --> 01:17:58,297
...and oranges.
- Unidentified...

1361
01:17:58,464 --> 01:17:59,590
...varnished object...

1362
01:17:59,757 --> 01:18:01,049
...turn back or we shoot.

1363
01:18:01,217 --> 01:18:02,217
Go!

1364
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:03,720
Turn back.

1365
01:18:05,930 --> 01:18:07,973
Happy Christmas!

1366
01:18:08,141 --> 01:18:10,434
In Santa we believe!

1367
01:18:11,811 --> 01:18:12,478
Go on, elf.

1368
01:18:12,770 --> 01:18:14,146
You too.

1369
01:18:17,650 --> 01:18:19,276
Fire missiles.

1370
01:18:20,361 --> 01:18:21,737
This is it, old fella.

1371
01:18:22,530 --> 01:18:23,364
Maybe the next...

1372
01:18:23,531 --> 01:18:25,950
...Santa never sat in my Evie...

1373
01:18:26,117 --> 01:18:27,409
...but Arthur did.

1374
01:18:27,577 --> 01:18:31,455
And he's as good a man
as any Santa there's ever been.

1375
01:18:37,629 --> 01:18:38,671
Goodbye, Evie.

1376
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:45,761
Thank you, everyone.

1377
01:18:45,929 --> 01:18:48,306
You just saved Christmas.

1378
01:18:59,901 --> 01:19:00,901
Trelew.

1379
01:19:04,864 --> 01:19:07,825
Out with the old, in with the new.

1380
01:19:08,159 --> 01:19:10,119
Well done, dear.

1381
01:19:16,251 --> 01:19:19,921
Poor Arthur. He tried so hard.

1382
01:19:20,296 --> 01:19:22,256
- He's flunked again.
- Of course...

1383
01:19:22,465 --> 01:19:23,591
...he hasn't, dear.

1384
01:19:23,758 --> 01:19:27,470
We're here. The little girl
will get her present.

1385
01:19:27,637 --> 01:19:30,473
I think he's done rather splendidly.

1386
01:19:31,557 --> 01:19:33,642
My Margaret.

1387
01:19:35,853 --> 01:19:39,356
Good morning, Gwen. Ho, ho, et cetera.

1388
01:19:39,524 --> 01:19:41,108
Apologies for the minor delay.

1389
01:19:41,276 --> 01:19:43,486
I'm sure that even a child
can understand...

1390
01:19:43,653 --> 01:19:46,030
...that in an operation
as complex as Christmas...

1391
01:19:46,197 --> 01:19:49,783
...there's always an insignificant
margin of error...

1392
01:19:49,951 --> 01:19:51,911
...which is you. As a gesture...

1393
01:19:52,078 --> 01:19:55,831
...I’ve upgraded you
to the Glamorfast Ultra X-3...

1394
01:19:55,999 --> 01:19:58,543
...which retails at 9.99 more
than your requested gift.

1395
01:19:59,252 --> 01:20:01,963
Bigger ergo better.

1396
01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:04,423
If you wouldn't mind
just signing a legal waiver?

1397
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:12,014
Pedro? A boy?

1398
01:20:14,475 --> 01:20:15,851
A Spanish boy?

1399
01:20:16,561 --> 01:20:17,645
This is an error.

1400
01:20:19,897 --> 01:20:21,189
Now get off the bike.

1401
01:20:21,399 --> 01:20:22,483
Will you get...?

1402
01:20:22,650 --> 01:20:24,568
No, no, no. Please don't cry.

1403
01:20:24,944 --> 01:20:26,403
No cry-0.

1404
01:20:29,282 --> 01:20:31,409
No "sob-idad."

1405
01:20:39,042 --> 01:20:40,043
It's over a mile.

1406
01:20:41,753 --> 01:20:44,714
We've got no sleigh, no reindeer,
and you can't even walk.

1407
01:20:46,966 --> 01:20:48,258
What are you doing?

1408
01:20:52,305 --> 01:20:53,305
I can cycle!

1409
01:20:53,806 --> 01:20:55,265
Oi! Come back!

1410
01:20:55,433 --> 01:20:57,560
What about the wrapping?!

1411
01:20:59,145 --> 01:21:01,605
The church. She lives by the church!

1412
01:21:01,773 --> 01:21:04,025
Happy Christmas, cows!

1413
01:21:04,192 --> 01:21:07,653
Meltdown. Ten seconds
to figgy Flensburg. Snowman.

1414
01:21:07,820 --> 01:21:10,405
German, leave out the carrot.
Is Santa on shoe?

1415
01:21:10,907 --> 01:21:12,116
What the...?!

1416
01:21:13,618 --> 01:21:16,162
Look, everyone! It's Arthur!

1417
01:21:16,329 --> 01:21:18,914
He's delivering the present.

1418
01:21:19,082 --> 01:21:21,375
- It's Arthur.
- Hooray for Arthur!

1419
01:21:21,584 --> 01:21:22,835
Meltdown paused.

1420
01:21:26,005 --> 01:21:27,256
Come back!

1421
01:21:29,759 --> 01:21:31,802
Oh, my head.

1422
01:21:32,303 --> 01:21:34,471
Ye baubles,
a beautiful young reindeer.

1423
01:21:35,431 --> 01:21:37,099
So who am I, then?

1424
01:21:38,726 --> 01:21:41,103
Okay, so I'm not great with children.

1425
01:21:41,729 --> 01:21:43,522
Does that make me a bad Santa?

1426
01:21:44,982 --> 01:21:46,149
You're hardly perfect.

1427
01:21:46,317 --> 01:21:49,445
Let me guess. You put in the address,
you saw a list of Trelews...

1428
01:21:49,612 --> 01:21:51,530
...and just clicked on the first one?

1429
01:21:51,697 --> 01:21:53,156
You're just like Arthur.

1430
01:21:54,242 --> 01:21:55,743
- Am I?
- North Pole...

1431
01:21:55,910 --> 01:21:58,996
- ...incoming.
- Sir, the soldiers have shot the sleigh.

1432
01:21:59,372 --> 01:22:00,373
But, sir...

1433
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:03,251
...it's Arthur. He's still going.

1434
01:22:03,418 --> 01:22:05,920
Arthur! Arthur! Arthur!

1435
01:22:07,046 --> 01:22:08,338
Arthur?

1436
01:22:10,883 --> 01:22:13,886
No one gets an unwrapped present
on my watch.

1437
01:22:16,973 --> 01:22:18,432
Three bits of sticky tape.

1438
01:22:18,808 --> 01:22:19,975
Three.

1439
01:22:20,768 --> 01:22:22,102
Stand up!

1440
01:22:25,189 --> 01:22:26,189
Finger!

1441
01:22:27,817 --> 01:22:28,859
The church!

1442
01:22:33,906 --> 01:22:35,282
Right foot.

1443
01:22:36,617 --> 01:22:37,951
Left foot.

1444
01:22:38,953 --> 01:22:39,953
There it is!

1445
01:22:43,541 --> 01:22:44,708
One!

1446
01:22:48,129 --> 01:22:49,129
Hands UP!

1447
01:22:58,890 --> 01:22:59,890
Arthur!

1448
01:23:00,016 --> 01:23:02,435
Arthur! Arthur! Arthur!

1449
01:23:02,602 --> 01:23:03,602
Nearly there!

1450
01:23:05,521 --> 01:23:06,897
Front wheel!

1451
01:23:13,070 --> 01:23:14,154
'TWO!
'Yes!

1452
01:23:15,698 --> 01:23:16,698
That's it, there!

1453
01:23:19,869 --> 01:23:20,869
Back wheel!

1454
01:23:21,996 --> 01:23:23,664
- Ready?
- Do it!

1455
01:23:27,627 --> 01:23:29,003
Here we go!

1456
01:23:39,972 --> 01:23:40,972
Three!

1457
01:23:45,645 --> 01:23:47,104
Elf down.

1458
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:48,522
Bryony?

1459
01:23:48,731 --> 01:23:51,233
Go on, Arthur. Quick!

1460
01:23:52,318 --> 01:23:54,361
There's always time for a bow.

1461
01:24:03,704 --> 01:24:06,707
No, we can't be too late.

1462
01:24:30,690 --> 01:24:32,400
It's so unfair.

1463
01:24:37,655 --> 01:24:39,782
Merry Christmas!

1464
01:24:44,495 --> 01:24:46,747
All the Santas
taking the missing present.

1465
01:24:46,914 --> 01:24:48,081
It's beautiful!

1466
01:24:48,249 --> 01:24:50,000
Hug me. Hug me.

1467
01:25:25,453 --> 01:25:26,537
Dad!

1468
01:25:26,704 --> 01:25:29,707
You came! I knew you would.

1469
01:25:29,874 --> 01:25:32,543
You wouldn't just go to bed
and forget Gwen.

1470
01:25:34,337 --> 01:25:36,797
You're Santa!

1471
01:25:42,803 --> 01:25:44,012
Give me that.

1472
01:25:44,180 --> 01:25:45,931
I'm Santa! I'm delivering it!

1473
01:25:46,098 --> 01:25:49,101
Don't be silly, I'm Santa.
Can't you see from me suit?

1474
01:25:49,268 --> 01:25:51,728
I am actually Santa,
and I think it would be best...

1475
01:25:51,896 --> 01:25:53,731
I'm Santa! You handed over!

1476
01:25:53,898 --> 01:25:56,609
- I didn't, in fact, technically...
- You said I could drive!

1477
01:25:56,776 --> 01:26:00,237
I'm Santa, you naughty boys.
Here, have a bonbon.

1478
01:26:00,404 --> 01:26:01,404
You...

1479
01:26:03,616 --> 01:26:04,992
It's Christmas!

1480
01:26:05,951 --> 01:26:07,285
Please.

1481
01:26:08,204 --> 01:26:11,624
Gwen just has to have a present
from Santa.

1482
01:26:17,463 --> 01:26:19,381
You do it, Arthur.

1483
01:26:21,342 --> 01:26:23,427
Mummy! Daddy! Wake up!

1484
01:26:35,272 --> 01:26:37,482
There's a ribbon! To downstairs!

1485
01:26:38,567 --> 01:26:42,362
- Father, please keep it down.
- Merry Christmas, everyone.

1486
01:26:44,323 --> 01:26:45,323
Dad, wait.

1487
01:26:46,409 --> 01:26:48,202
Please, let's...

1488
01:26:50,663 --> 01:26:54,583
In all my years, I've never actually...

1489
01:26:55,918 --> 01:26:57,878
Always so busy.

1490
01:27:01,966 --> 01:27:03,342
Too busy.

1491
01:27:04,468 --> 01:27:06,261
I'm not good at...

1492
01:27:09,598 --> 01:27:13,435
In my day, a pat on the back
and a walnut went a long way.

1493
01:27:14,395 --> 01:27:17,856
Mummy, Daddy, come on!
Look, a ribbon to downstairs!

1494
01:27:18,023 --> 01:27:20,483
- Come on, then.
- I think it's under the tree!

1495
01:27:20,651 --> 01:27:22,152
Oh, look!

1496
01:27:22,695 --> 01:27:23,821
What is it?

1497
01:27:23,988 --> 01:27:25,739
I can see pink!

1498
01:27:26,991 --> 01:27:29,284
It's a bike!

1499
01:27:31,287 --> 01:27:34,373
Santa brought me the bike I wanted!

1500
01:27:34,540 --> 01:27:35,666
Did he?

1501
01:27:36,208 --> 01:27:39,127
Can I have a go?
Please, please, please?

1502
01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:40,420
Steve...

1503
01:27:40,671 --> 01:27:42,881
...you deserve to be Santa.

1504
01:27:50,639 --> 01:27:52,098
But, Steve...

1505
01:27:52,266 --> 01:27:56,766
...I wonder if Gwen is right.

1506
01:27:59,523 --> 01:28:02,108
Watch out. Careful...

1507
01:28:02,276 --> 01:28:03,777
...I'm gonna bump into you.

1508
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:09,574
Oh, no.

1509
01:28:19,335 --> 01:28:22,171
I'll be the candle, eh?

1510
01:28:31,639 --> 01:28:34,141
You're better men than...

1511
01:28:35,810 --> 01:28:37,228
Both of you.

1512
01:28:38,395 --> 01:28:40,647
A bike and...

1513
01:28:40,815 --> 01:28:42,233
...a squirrel!

1514
01:28:45,736 --> 01:28:47,362
Drop complete.

1515
01:28:49,031 --> 01:28:51,408
And we have a new Santa!

1516
01:28:52,076 --> 01:28:53,827
Christmas accomplished.

1517
01:28:53,994 --> 01:28:54,994
Arthur!

1518
01:28:55,287 --> 01:28:57,706
- Oh, Arthur.
- Commence...

1519
01:28:57,873 --> 01:28:59,332
...decking halls.

1520
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:03,712
You know, I've always liked Arthur.
Do you think he likes espresso?

1521
01:31:23,978 --> 01:31:28,232
And may 100 percent
of your Christmases be white.
