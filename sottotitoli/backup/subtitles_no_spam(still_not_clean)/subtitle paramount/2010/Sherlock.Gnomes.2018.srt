1
00:00:50,892 --> 00:00:55,897

2
00:01:02,767 --> 00:01:04,764
Welcome.

3
00:01:04,766 --> 00:01:06,531
You're just in time
for our story.

4
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:08,664
An epic detective adventure.

5
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:10,930
Sherlock Holmes,
the greatest...

6
00:01:10,932 --> 00:01:12,962
Oh, let's do
"Gnomeo and Juliet" instead!

7
00:01:12,964 --> 00:01:14,497
Yeah, we've already
done that.

8
00:01:14,499 --> 00:01:15,897
Hey, hey, I know!
"Game of Gnomes!"

9
00:01:15,899 --> 00:01:18,831
- Or "The Gnome Ranger."
- No, we're doing this.

10
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:22,298
Sherlock Holmes, the greatest
detective of all time.

11
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,031
And ours
will be the best ever.

12
00:01:24,033 --> 00:01:26,430
Because our Sherlock
is a...

13
00:01:26,432 --> 00:01:27,965
Let's do "The Twilight Gnome."

14
00:01:27,967 --> 00:01:30,097
- No, no!
- Or "Spider-Man: Gnomecoming."

15
00:01:30,099 --> 00:01:31,397
Or "Indiana Gnomes."

16
00:01:31,399 --> 00:01:35,166
No! Because our Sherlock
is a garden gnome!

17
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,563
He's a garden gnome! Okay?

18
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:40,465
Oh, well, why didn't you
just say that?

19
00:01:41,699 --> 00:01:43,664
Prepare for a tale
of suspense,

20
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:45,631
intrigue, and mystery.

21
00:01:45,633 --> 00:01:47,498
Ooh, mystery.

22
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,800
Prepare for "Sherlock Gnomes."

23
00:01:55,633 --> 00:01:56,965
The final clue, Watson.

24
00:01:56,967 --> 00:01:59,063
The kidnapped gnomes
are in the museum.

25
00:01:59,065 --> 00:02:00,965
And seconds away
from being smashed!

26
00:02:01,167 --> 00:02:02,933
We shall see about that.

27
00:02:03,634 --> 00:02:05,834
- Help!
- Help.

28
00:02:07,634 --> 00:02:09,931
Show yourself, Moriarty!

29
00:02:09,933 --> 00:02:11,866
Help! I'm stuck!

30
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,299
Oh, Sherlock.

31
00:02:13,301 --> 00:02:14,741
How can I resist
a request like that?

32
00:02:14,766 --> 00:02:18,832
Ta-da! Here I am! Your
favorite evil pie mascot.

33
00:02:18,834 --> 00:02:21,566
Though I said "evil",
I do cry at sad films.

34
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:23,333
I'm very complex.
Don't try and get me.

35
00:02:23,568 --> 00:02:25,164
Shirley.
Could I call you that?

36
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:28,566
You are just in time to see
these gnomes go extinct.

37
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,099
This stops now, Moriarty.

38
00:02:33,101 --> 00:02:34,332
Oh, be honest, Sherlock.

39
00:02:34,334 --> 00:02:36,201
You enjoy our little game
as much as I do.

40
00:02:36,433 --> 00:02:37,998
This is no game.

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,231
I am the sworn protector
of London's garden gnomes.

42
00:02:40,233 --> 00:02:42,899
If you are the sworn protector
of the city's gnomes,

43
00:02:42,901 --> 00:02:44,764
then I am
their sworn destroyer!

44
00:02:44,766 --> 00:02:48,066
And we will keep playing
this little game, Sherlock,

45
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:50,832
until I crush
every last gnome in London.

46
00:02:50,834 --> 00:02:53,665
I'll stop you
until the day I die.

47
00:02:53,667 --> 00:02:54,997
Oh, lightbulb moment.

48
00:02:54,999 --> 00:02:57,932
What is it?
Yeah, today's that day.

49
00:02:58,201 --> 00:03:00,901
Come, Sherlock.
Come dance with me.

50
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:23,133
Ow!

51
00:03:23,135 --> 00:03:24,201
No!

52
00:03:27,201 --> 00:03:29,000
Fudge buckets.

53
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:32,669
Sherlock!

54
00:03:42,302 --> 00:03:43,500
No thanks needed.

55
00:03:43,502 --> 00:03:45,669
It is my sworn duty
to protect you.

56
00:03:46,135 --> 00:03:47,265
No hugs.

57
00:03:47,267 --> 00:03:49,734
- Oh, Watson.
- Yes, Sherlock?

58
00:03:49,736 --> 00:03:51,468
Yours, I believe.

59
00:03:58,635 --> 00:04:00,334
It's over, Watson.

60
00:04:00,336 --> 00:04:01,800
With Moriarty gone,

61
00:04:01,802 --> 00:04:05,702
London is once again safe
for all garden gnomes.

62
00:04:49,937 --> 00:04:52,069
Our new home in London.

63
00:04:52,071 --> 00:04:54,101
Oh, doesn't it look lovely?

64
00:04:54,103 --> 00:04:56,134
It's a long way
from Stratford-upon-Avon.

65
00:04:56,136 --> 00:04:57,935
But a lot
closer to the grandkids.

66
00:04:58,203 --> 00:05:01,771
And we'll feel better once we
get our gnomes in the garden.

67
00:05:06,937 --> 00:05:07,935
London.

68
00:05:07,937 --> 00:05:10,403
A brand new
adventure for us,

69
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:12,502
and our star-crossed lovers,

70
00:05:12,504 --> 00:05:15,038
Gnomeo and Juliet.

71
00:05:16,304 --> 00:05:19,235
Right. Let's go out
and buy an expensive coffee.

72
00:05:19,237 --> 00:05:21,036
That's what people
do around here.

73
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:23,267
Oh, yes,
I've been practicing my order.

74
00:05:23,269 --> 00:05:27,136
A skinny triple shot
soy latte, extra dry.

75
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:39,735
What a dump!

76
00:05:42,105 --> 00:05:43,668
Where's the new garden?

77
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,937
This is the new garden, Fawn.

78
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:48,468
Naw, I'm going
back in the box.

79
00:05:51,405 --> 00:05:52,970
Girls! Language.

80
00:05:52,972 --> 00:05:55,705
I guess it's a fixer-upper?

81
00:05:55,937 --> 00:05:57,470
Well, I think

82
00:05:57,472 --> 00:06:00,538
that it's the most beautiful
garden in the world

83
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:02,470
because you're standing in it.

84
00:06:02,472 --> 00:06:04,868
- Oof, that was super cheesy.
- Aw, seriously?

85
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:08,002
I practiced that line in the
car for about 10 minutes.

86
00:06:08,004 --> 00:06:10,605
It was, like, awful.

87
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:14,238
Oh, I bet there's a pretty
good view up there.

88
00:06:15,138 --> 00:06:16,670
I'll let you know
when I get there first.

89
00:06:16,672 --> 00:06:19,039
Right, come here.

90
00:06:22,172 --> 00:06:23,239
Whoa!

91
00:06:29,538 --> 00:06:31,138
You win.

92
00:06:32,071 --> 00:06:33,139
Come here.

93
00:06:43,271 --> 00:06:44,671
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

94
00:06:56,973 --> 00:06:59,040
Think of all the adventures
we're gonna have.

95
00:06:59,574 --> 00:07:03,374
Juliet, come down this
instant, before you fall.

96
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:04,903
When is he gonna realize

97
00:07:04,905 --> 00:07:06,938
you're the toughest gnome
in the garden?

98
00:07:07,206 --> 00:07:09,706
Now that was a good line.

99
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,937
She loves me.

100
00:07:12,939 --> 00:07:15,072
She loves me not.
She loves me...

101
00:07:15,305 --> 00:07:16,603
Oh, hi, Nanette.

102
00:07:16,605 --> 00:07:19,271
Ooh, I think someone's
got a crush on someone.

103
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,038
Mmm. Maybe.

104
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,071
Oh, well, maybe they have
a crush on you back.

105
00:07:24,073 --> 00:07:26,238
- Do you really think so?
- I don't know.

106
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,170
- I don't know who it is, do I?
- Oh.

107
00:07:28,172 --> 00:07:30,682
- Gather 'round, everyone.
- Come on, everybody.

108
00:07:32,006 --> 00:07:35,106
Choppity-chop!
We have an announcement.

109
00:07:36,905 --> 00:07:40,439
Lord Redbrick and I
are officially retiring.

110
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,971
We both think a new garden

111
00:07:42,973 --> 00:07:47,240
is the perfect opportunity
to name new leaders.

112
00:07:47,574 --> 00:07:50,273
Gnomeo and Juliet.

113
00:07:50,773 --> 00:07:51,903
Us?

114
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:56,704
Hurray for nepotism.
Unbelievable.

115
00:07:56,706 --> 00:07:59,206
Gnomeo and Juliet will lead us

116
00:08:00,239 --> 00:08:01,305
in preparing the garden
for winter.

117
00:08:01,307 --> 00:08:04,939
As soon as the garden
blooms in the spring,

118
00:08:05,141 --> 00:08:08,708
we'll have a Seedling
Ceremony to celebrate.

119
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,206
- Come along, dear.
- Ooh.

120
00:08:11,874 --> 00:08:13,971
Look at this place.
Isn't it perfect?

121
00:08:13,973 --> 00:08:15,305
It's awful.

122
00:08:15,307 --> 00:08:18,505
Unbelievably awful.
But it is ours.

123
00:08:18,507 --> 00:08:20,540
Yeah, it's ours.

124
00:08:20,874 --> 00:08:23,242
And I'm gonna
show this garden who's boss.

125
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:31,741
Hmm.

126
00:08:32,574 --> 00:08:35,672
Watson! Look what you've done
to the globe.

127
00:08:35,674 --> 00:08:37,271
Me?

128
00:08:37,273 --> 00:08:38,939
- You're the one who kicked it.
- Because you ducked.

129
00:08:38,941 --> 00:08:41,637
The very reason you're wearing
padding is so I can kick you.

130
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:43,772
I am not your punching bag!

131
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:45,306
Don't be absurd.
Of course you are.

132
00:08:45,308 --> 00:08:47,972
Oh, how I miss
having a proper enemy.

133
00:08:47,974 --> 00:08:50,439
Well, I'm sorry
I'm not Moriarty.

134
00:08:50,441 --> 00:08:54,305
Sherlock! Watson!
Just look at this mess!

135
00:08:54,307 --> 00:08:56,373
How many times
have I told you?

136
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:59,808
If you want to practice
fighting, do it outside!

137
00:09:00,008 --> 00:09:01,840
We're sorry, Mrs. Udderson.

138
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:04,107
Sherlock Gnomes!
Sherlock Gnomes!

139
00:09:04,109 --> 00:09:06,172
And Dr. W...
Ooh! Oof!

140
00:09:06,174 --> 00:09:07,539
Finally, a new case.

141
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:09,207
- What seems to be the trouble?
- It's my friends.

142
00:09:09,209 --> 00:09:11,373
All my friends.
The whole garden.

143
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:13,805
They've disappeared.
They're all gone!

144
00:09:13,807 --> 00:09:15,339
A whole garden?

145
00:09:15,341 --> 00:09:18,739
Watson, gnomes are in danger.
To the scene of the crime.

146
00:09:18,741 --> 00:09:20,439
<i>Breaking news!</i>

147
00:09:20,441 --> 00:09:22,872
<i>While London prepares for its
largest fireworks display ever,</i>

148
00:09:22,874 --> 00:09:24,741
<i>something barely newsworthy
is happening</i>

149
00:09:24,743 --> 00:09:26,108
<i>in the gardens
across the capital.</i>

150
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:28,306
<i>Someone is out there
stealing innocent gnomes.</i>

151
00:09:28,308 --> 00:09:31,339
<i>Like Barry. Barry was just
sitting there, doing nothing.</i>

152
00:09:31,341 --> 00:09:32,440
<i>Now he's gone.</i>

153
00:09:32,442 --> 00:09:34,239
<i>And Barry is just
the tip of the iceberg.</i>

154
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:37,108
<i>Susan, Tim, Brad, gone.</i>

155
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:40,074
<i>This weird gnome
with his sparkly piano, gone!</i>

156
00:09:40,076 --> 00:09:42,174
<i>These gnomes on a pig,
for no reason.</i>

157
00:09:42,176 --> 00:09:44,239
<i>I hope that's not ham
on that pizza.</i>

158
00:09:44,241 --> 00:09:47,040
<i>All gone! The list goes on.</i>

159
00:09:47,042 --> 00:09:48,940
<i>When contacted,
the police said...</i>

160
00:09:48,942 --> 00:09:51,773
<i>We have no time for this.
Please don't contact us again.</i>

161
00:09:53,008 --> 00:09:54,339
<i>They're clearly swamped.</i>

162
00:09:54,341 --> 00:09:57,475
<i>Some say it's a job
for Sherlock Gnomes.</i>

163
00:09:57,943 --> 00:10:00,509
<i>Others say
it's a slow news day.</i>

164
00:10:05,143 --> 00:10:07,074
All right, Barbara,
time for bed.

165
00:10:10,808 --> 00:10:11,907
Ugh.

166
00:10:11,909 --> 00:10:13,677
Humans are tiresomely naive.

167
00:10:13,942 --> 00:10:17,907
It is an ornamental crime on a
scale we have never seen before.

168
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:20,610
This garden alone
lost 10 gnomes today.

169
00:10:23,076 --> 00:10:26,976
Grass, perfectly even.
Soil, undisturbed.

170
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:29,244
Ant colony, thriving.

171
00:10:29,677 --> 00:10:32,907
- Do you see it, Watson?
- Yes, there are no footprints.

172
00:10:34,409 --> 00:10:35,576
Hmm.

173
00:10:37,744 --> 00:10:39,440
Hmm.

174
00:10:39,442 --> 00:10:42,109
Someone kidnapped all the
gnomes from this backyard

175
00:10:42,344 --> 00:10:45,944
without leaving
a single footprint.

176
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:53,943
A gnome can dream.

177
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:56,345
- Benny.
- Aye?

178
00:10:56,577 --> 00:10:59,109
So, have you talked
to the lucky lady yet?

179
00:10:59,111 --> 00:11:01,708
Told your mystery crush
you adore her?

180
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,442
Funny you should say that...

181
00:11:03,711 --> 00:11:05,141
- No.
- Well, why not?

182
00:11:05,143 --> 00:11:06,842
Is she that scary?
Is she? I mean, is she?

183
00:11:06,844 --> 00:11:08,677
She can be.

184
00:11:09,111 --> 00:11:11,611
<i>La vida buena.</i>

185
00:11:12,043 --> 00:11:13,508
Don't work too hard, Mankini.

186
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:15,742
You've only been lying there
for four days.

187
00:11:15,744 --> 00:11:17,576
Sun's out, buns out!

188
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:20,743
I'm okay.

189
00:11:22,177 --> 00:11:25,311
Hey, we said that we were gonna plant
these next to the shed, remember?

190
00:11:25,543 --> 00:11:27,778
Yeah, but they look
better there.

191
00:11:28,345 --> 00:11:30,778
Oh, all right. I suppose.

192
00:11:31,009 --> 00:11:32,575
Here. Let me help you
with that.

193
00:11:32,577 --> 00:11:34,177
Whoa, hey!

194
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:36,710
- I feel sick.
- Me, too.

195
00:11:36,978 --> 00:11:40,275
This garden is still missing something.
Something special.

196
00:11:40,277 --> 00:11:41,709
Oh, I was just thinking that.

197
00:11:41,711 --> 00:11:43,477
Do you know what would
be great? Maybe...

198
00:11:43,479 --> 00:11:45,440
Something that will tie
the whole garden together.

199
00:11:47,044 --> 00:11:49,077
What about
a new centerpiece?

200
00:11:49,379 --> 00:11:51,175
- I'm gonna throw up.
- I've got it.

201
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:53,244
We need a new centerpiece.

202
00:11:53,544 --> 00:11:55,275
That's exactly
what I just said.

203
00:11:55,277 --> 00:11:57,909
Never mind, great minds
thing alike. Am I right?

204
00:11:57,911 --> 00:12:00,544
Oh, there's so much to do.
I better get started on it.

205
00:12:02,044 --> 00:12:03,376
Awkward.

206
00:12:04,312 --> 00:12:07,377
Don't you worry. I know her.

207
00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:10,611
And she was hanging on
to your every word.

208
00:12:10,911 --> 00:12:12,109
I think he bought it.

209
00:12:12,111 --> 00:12:13,510
Ever since
we took over the garden,

210
00:12:13,512 --> 00:12:16,512
it's like she's not
listening to me anymore.

211
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:20,742
Eh? Oh, sorry,
I wasn't listening.

212
00:12:20,744 --> 00:12:22,410
But I have got an idea.

213
00:12:22,412 --> 00:12:26,042
You should do
a grand romantic gesture.

214
00:12:26,044 --> 00:12:28,243
Something reckless
and life-threatening.

215
00:12:30,846 --> 00:12:32,642
I've got it!

216
00:12:32,644 --> 00:12:35,010
Go to the zoo
and steal a lion!

217
00:12:35,012 --> 00:12:37,210
Then fight the lion
in front of Juliet.

218
00:12:37,212 --> 00:12:39,044
I am not fighting a lion.

219
00:12:39,046 --> 00:12:41,011
It doesn't have to be a lion.

220
00:12:41,013 --> 00:12:43,446
It could be a tiger.
Or an angry penguin.

221
00:12:43,678 --> 00:12:45,845
I mean,
it's either that or flowers.

222
00:12:46,147 --> 00:12:47,642
Flowers? That's it.

223
00:12:47,644 --> 00:12:49,877
I'll get her our special
flower for the centerpiece.

224
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:51,712
Nanette, you're a genius.

225
00:12:52,446 --> 00:12:54,946
Oi, Benny, can you give me
a hand with something?

226
00:12:55,278 --> 00:12:56,845
Step into my office.

227
00:13:04,278 --> 00:13:06,311
The previous owners
left a bunch

228
00:13:06,313 --> 00:13:08,613
of amazing electronics
in here.

229
00:13:10,047 --> 00:13:11,311
Ta-da!

230
00:13:11,313 --> 00:13:13,279
Um...

231
00:13:14,446 --> 00:13:17,010
It was on the computer
when I found it.

232
00:13:17,012 --> 00:13:19,678
Yeah, mate.
Yeah, sure it was.

233
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,946
Right. Image search.

234
00:13:22,212 --> 00:13:25,178
All right, type in
"Cupid's Arrow Orchid".

235
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,877
You just have to hit it.
Just click it.

236
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:29,877
Just click the thing! You don't have
to type the whole sent... All right.

237
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:32,944
Tell me when you see it.
Tell me when you see it.

238
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:34,411
That's the one!

239
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:36,679
First time we met we was
trying to get one of those.

240
00:13:38,246 --> 00:13:40,367
So, we just need to find a
flower shop that sells 'em.

241
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,444
Zero-point-eight miles.

242
00:13:45,446 --> 00:13:48,444
And looks like there's a massive blue
line on the ground you can follow.

243
00:13:48,446 --> 00:13:50,078
Isn't that handy?

244
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,379
Let's do this.

245
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:00,312
I'll have eyes and ears on you
at all times.

246
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,480
All right, mate?
Let's go liberate a flower!

247
00:14:20,414 --> 00:14:22,479
<i>Tiny Dancer,
come in, Tiny Dancer.</i>

248
00:14:22,481 --> 00:14:25,113
<i>This is Benny 101

249
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:26,646
<i>close brackets

250
00:14:26,648 --> 00:14:29,148
<i>smiley-face emoji
dollar sign dollar sign.</i>

251
00:14:29,647 --> 00:14:31,646
You have got to pick
another code name.

252
00:14:31,648 --> 00:14:32,648
There's no time.

253
00:14:45,815 --> 00:14:48,347
- Benny, can you...
- <i>Benny 101 dash brackets</i>

254
00:14:48,349 --> 00:14:50,713
<i>the Benlord close brackets
exclamation mark</i>

255
00:14:50,715 --> 00:14:53,779
<i>smiley-face emoji dollar
sign dollar sign. Yes?</i>

256
00:14:54,947 --> 00:14:56,445
Can you pull up
the shop's blueprints

257
00:14:56,447 --> 00:14:57,880
and show me
the best entry points?

258
00:14:57,882 --> 00:14:59,246
Yes, I can.

259
00:14:59,248 --> 00:15:00,881
No, I can't.

260
00:15:01,347 --> 00:15:02,615
You...

261
00:15:03,048 --> 00:15:05,914
I see a ventilation shaft.
Will that get me inside?

262
00:15:07,148 --> 00:15:08,881
Ooh.

263
00:15:08,883 --> 00:15:12,849
I have no idea.
It might. Over.

264
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:16,381
All right. I'm in.

265
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:18,349
<i>Nice work, Tiny Dancer.</i>

266
00:15:24,749 --> 00:15:25,512
<i>Ooh, that must
be the burglar alarm.</i>

267
00:15:25,514 --> 00:15:26,646
<i>What's your plan, Tiny D?</i>

268
00:15:26,648 --> 00:15:28,247
Just the usual.
Totally wing it,

269
00:15:28,249 --> 00:15:30,813
risk life and limb,
escape by the skin of my teeth.

270
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:33,282
I call it
"pulling a Gnomeo."

271
00:15:36,582 --> 00:15:38,682
And, uh,
don't call me Tiny D.

272
00:15:51,983 --> 00:15:54,912
Gnomeo? Hey, Benny,
have you seen Gnomeo?

273
00:15:54,914 --> 00:15:57,214
No! Well, maybe.

274
00:15:57,816 --> 00:16:00,580
Is that Gnomeo?
He left the garden?

275
00:16:00,582 --> 00:16:02,915
- Oh, no.
- <i>Where is he? What is he doing?</i>

276
00:16:06,448 --> 00:16:08,548
Oh, fertilizer.

277
00:16:17,082 --> 00:16:19,982
Next time, remember
to have an escape plan.

278
00:16:21,116 --> 00:16:22,783
If there is a next time.

279
00:16:37,049 --> 00:16:38,348
Hurry.

280
00:16:41,783 --> 00:16:44,882
Eight gardens of
gnomes vanish into thin air.

281
00:16:44,884 --> 00:16:49,315
No clues. Not so much
as a single footprint.

282
00:16:49,317 --> 00:16:52,482
There is only one ornament evil
enough and brilliant enough

283
00:16:52,484 --> 00:16:55,050
to pull off
such a diabolical scheme.

284
00:16:55,884 --> 00:16:56,814
Moriarty.

285
00:16:56,816 --> 00:16:58,748
Moriarty?
But that's impossible.

286
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,949
Moriarty was smashed.
We saw it.

287
00:17:01,316 --> 00:17:03,616
We can't have seen
the complete picture.

288
00:17:03,816 --> 00:17:05,049
He's alive.

289
00:17:05,051 --> 00:17:06,814
How could he possibly
have survived?

290
00:17:06,816 --> 00:17:09,082
Anyway, Moriarty
always left us a clue,

291
00:17:09,084 --> 00:17:10,216
his calling card.

292
00:17:10,218 --> 00:17:13,918
Yes. What am I missing?

293
00:17:15,218 --> 00:17:16,583
Watson, give me your map.

294
00:17:20,351 --> 00:17:22,051
The gnomes
that just moved in...

295
00:17:22,518 --> 00:17:24,115
Where do they live?

296
00:17:24,117 --> 00:17:25,250
I believe right here.

297
00:17:25,718 --> 00:17:27,149
A-ha! Do you see, Watson?

298
00:17:27,151 --> 00:17:29,451
Moriarty has left
his calling card.

299
00:17:30,951 --> 00:17:32,216
"M"!

300
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:35,418
Hurry, Watson! Those gnomes
are in terrible danger.

301
00:17:40,085 --> 00:17:42,352
Juliet! Wait! Stop! I...

302
00:17:43,151 --> 00:17:44,416
I... I can explain.

303
00:17:44,418 --> 00:17:46,350
What on Earth
were you thinking?

304
00:17:46,352 --> 00:17:47,951
I was getting this!

305
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,548
Remember this?

306
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:51,851
You risked getting smashed
for some flower?

307
00:17:51,853 --> 00:17:55,549
Not some flower, our flower.
I did this for you.

308
00:17:55,551 --> 00:17:57,649
You did this for me? For me?

309
00:17:57,651 --> 00:18:00,750
I've got responsibilities.
I don't have time for this!

310
00:18:00,752 --> 00:18:02,382
No, you just
don't have time for us.

311
00:18:02,384 --> 00:18:04,449
There will be plenty
of time for us

312
00:18:04,451 --> 00:18:05,917
after I get the garden ready.

313
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,449
Unbelievable!

314
00:18:07,451 --> 00:18:09,083
What do you care more about,
the garden or me?

315
00:18:09,085 --> 00:18:11,249
- Oh. You're being ridiculous!
- That is not an answer.

316
00:18:11,251 --> 00:18:14,484
The garden can't wait
and you can!

317
00:18:18,618 --> 00:18:20,584
<i>Gnomeo, help!
There's something here!</i>

318
00:18:20,586 --> 00:18:21,852
<i>It's a... Whoa!</i>

319
00:18:22,252 --> 00:18:23,818
Benny! What's going on?

320
00:18:36,452 --> 00:18:38,182
- Dad!
- Mom!

321
00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:39,884
- Nanette!
- Benny!

322
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,852
Ju, they're all gone.

323
00:18:42,452 --> 00:18:43,885
We're too late.

324
00:18:44,451 --> 00:18:45,616
Please step back.

325
00:18:45,618 --> 00:18:47,351
This is an active
crime scene.

326
00:18:47,353 --> 00:18:50,485
Hey! Who are you and what are
you doing in our garden?

327
00:18:50,487 --> 00:18:51,852
Your garden?

328
00:18:51,854 --> 00:18:53,616
Where were the two of you
when this happened?

329
00:18:53,618 --> 00:18:56,118
Oh... They were having
a lovers' quarrel.

330
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:58,052
See how she's
facing away from him?

331
00:18:58,054 --> 00:18:59,450
She's angry with him.

332
00:18:59,452 --> 00:19:02,517
The flower in his hand was
intended as a romantic gesture.

333
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:05,153
A desperate act
that predictably backfired.

334
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:06,884
- Oi!
- Watson.

335
00:19:06,886 --> 00:19:08,616
Search the west quadrant.

336
00:19:08,618 --> 00:19:10,118
If that fiend is behind this,

337
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,286
he will have left
his calling card.

338
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:13,752
What's this?

339
00:19:15,252 --> 00:19:16,818
Let me see that.

340
00:19:17,054 --> 00:19:18,254
Tell me what it is.

341
00:19:18,488 --> 00:19:19,751
It's a clue.

342
00:19:19,753 --> 00:19:21,485
It will lead us
to our next destination.

343
00:19:21,487 --> 00:19:24,450
And if you ever want to see
your friends and family again,

344
00:19:24,452 --> 00:19:25,985
you'll hand it over.

345
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:32,985
The nine.

346
00:19:33,253 --> 00:19:35,151
There is a slight crack
in its leg.

347
00:19:35,153 --> 00:19:40,020
Hmm. Where have I seen
this particular nine before?

348
00:19:41,186 --> 00:19:43,119
<i>Nine, nine, nine, nine...</i>

349
00:20:01,653 --> 00:20:03,586
Nine! I've got it!

350
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,553
To Chinatown, Watson.

351
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,753
The game is afoot.

352
00:20:09,521 --> 00:20:11,721
Mate,
you're going nowhere...

353
00:20:13,122 --> 00:20:15,385
Stay here!
We're on the case.

354
00:20:15,387 --> 00:20:16,786
What a complete and total...

355
00:20:16,788 --> 00:20:18,753
Get up.
We're going after them.

356
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:23,753
Wait!

357
00:20:35,954 --> 00:20:37,753
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

358
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,653
Wait!

359
00:20:44,555 --> 00:20:46,154
All ahead full, Watson.

360
00:20:48,555 --> 00:20:50,555
No, wait for us!

361
00:20:52,922 --> 00:20:54,019
Hold on!

362
00:20:54,021 --> 00:20:56,255
Forget them!
We can handle this ourselves.

363
00:20:56,489 --> 00:20:58,587
Or do the exact opposite.
Your call.

364
00:20:58,788 --> 00:21:01,122
Keep those tablets
coming, Watson.

365
00:21:07,622 --> 00:21:09,889
The water level.
It's dropping.

366
00:21:10,655 --> 00:21:11,989
Cut the engines!

367
00:21:14,955 --> 00:21:16,687
Now tell us
what happened to our family.

368
00:21:16,689 --> 00:21:19,187
We don't have time for this.
Will you please step aside?

369
00:21:19,189 --> 00:21:21,219
Not until you tell us
what's going on.

370
00:21:21,221 --> 00:21:22,353
Hmm?

371
00:21:22,355 --> 00:21:24,688
- Oh. Too late.
- What's too late?

372
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:26,152
Oh, here they come.

373
00:21:26,154 --> 00:21:27,920
And now we have a rat problem,

374
00:21:27,922 --> 00:21:30,453
thanks to these
meddlesome amateurs.

375
00:21:32,088 --> 00:21:33,953
If you don't
want to get trampled,

376
00:21:33,955 --> 00:21:35,920
I suggest you help
Watson pull.

377
00:21:35,922 --> 00:21:38,123
Come on! Give me a hand.

378
00:21:44,589 --> 00:21:45,821
Oh, phew.

379
00:21:45,823 --> 00:21:47,953
"Phew"? Young gnome,

380
00:21:47,955 --> 00:21:51,255
what exactly do you think
those rats were running from?

381
00:21:51,457 --> 00:21:52,557
Oh, no.

382
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:03,324
There!
That's our way out!

383
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:06,589
Sherlock! Hold on!

384
00:22:31,524 --> 00:22:32,854
Are you okay?

385
00:22:32,856 --> 00:22:34,522
You were saying,
uh, something about

386
00:22:34,524 --> 00:22:35,889
"meddlesome amateurs"?

387
00:22:35,891 --> 00:22:37,988
I stand by that assessment.

388
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:42,324
But if you insist on meddling, perhaps
you could supplement Watson's efforts.

389
00:22:42,922 --> 00:22:44,522
How thoughtful.

390
00:22:44,524 --> 00:22:45,988
What did you say
your names were?

391
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,287
- We didn't. I'm Gnomeo.
- Juliet.

392
00:22:48,289 --> 00:22:51,390
I'm Sherlock Gnomes, the world's
first consulting detective

393
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:53,855
and sworn protector
of London's garden gnomes.

394
00:22:53,857 --> 00:22:56,022
- And I am...
- No time for that now, Watson.

395
00:22:56,024 --> 00:22:58,391
To the surface!
We've not a moment to lose.

396
00:23:00,723 --> 00:23:04,088
Look, now we're on the team, how
about you tell us what's going on?

397
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,457
Starting with this.

398
00:23:05,923 --> 00:23:09,557
The "M" stands for Sherlock's
archenemy, Moriarty.

399
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:13,157
<i>♪ Moriarty's pies
The taste that makes you smile ♪</i>

400
00:23:13,457 --> 00:23:16,791
<i>♪ Filled with goobarb syrup
Makes you eat it all the while ♪</i>

401
00:23:17,057 --> 00:23:20,657
<i>Some ornaments
are just manufactured evil.</i>

402
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:24,624
<i>And Moriarty, he was
the most evil of the lot.</i>

403
00:23:27,525 --> 00:23:31,256
<i>For years, Moriarty terrorized
the ornamental world...</i>

404
00:23:33,159 --> 00:23:34,456
Oh.

405
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:36,925
<i>Until he met his match
in Sherlock Gnomes.</i>

406
00:23:37,326 --> 00:23:39,288
<i>Suddenly he had
a worthy opponent.</i>

407
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:40,390
Hmm.

408
00:23:40,392 --> 00:23:42,189
<i>And beating Sherlock
became his obsession.</i>

409
00:23:42,191 --> 00:23:45,025
<i>So Moriarty began to play
his terrible game.</i>

410
00:23:45,892 --> 00:23:47,857
<i>He would kidnap gnomes...</i>

411
00:23:48,891 --> 00:23:51,724
<i>leave a trail of clues
as to their location...</i>

412
00:23:52,892 --> 00:23:57,224
<i>and challenge us to find them
within 24 hours or he'd smash them.</i>

413
00:23:57,226 --> 00:23:59,590
He's gonna smash
our friends and family?

414
00:23:59,592 --> 00:24:00,856
So, how do we stop him?

415
00:24:00,858 --> 00:24:03,024
We play his game. For now.

416
00:24:03,226 --> 00:24:05,958
We follow his trail of clues
and find the gnomes.

417
00:24:16,924 --> 00:24:19,459
The 9 with
a crack in its leg.

418
00:24:21,326 --> 00:24:25,558
Just as I remembered.
Curly Fu's Emporium.

419
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:27,825
Let's go 'round the back.

420
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,758
The next clue will be inside.

421
00:24:40,893 --> 00:24:42,556
If you recall,

422
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:45,423
the last time we were here
it was a bit of a catastrophe.

423
00:24:45,425 --> 00:24:49,759
Yes. I have a memory
of some slight unpleasantness.

424
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:57,160
Put these on
so we don't get spotted.

425
00:24:58,192 --> 00:25:00,492
Now, just act natural.

426
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:06,923
I think that suits you.

427
00:25:06,925 --> 00:25:08,192
Focus.

428
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:12,027
There, you see.
We're blending in perfectly.

429
00:25:26,393 --> 00:25:29,460
I'm fairly sure
we've been spotted.

430
00:25:44,993 --> 00:25:50,125
Her Highness, the Grand
Empress dowager Pom-Pom!

431
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:58,660
Empress Pom-Pom remembers you,
Sherlock Gnomes.

432
00:25:58,993 --> 00:26:00,825
Oh, good, good.

433
00:26:00,827 --> 00:26:03,058
- Not fondly.
- Ah.

434
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,825
Well, that's less good,
isn't it?

435
00:26:04,827 --> 00:26:08,659
I see you got the orchid I sent to
apologize for our last encounter.

436
00:26:08,661 --> 00:26:10,593
A gracious gift.

437
00:26:10,595 --> 00:26:13,526
But you are not the one
who offended the Empress.

438
00:26:13,528 --> 00:26:15,259
Sherlock is.

439
00:26:15,261 --> 00:26:19,796
As such, I'm afraid
I must ask you all to leave.

440
00:26:20,061 --> 00:26:22,493
Shake it, shake it, shake it.
Out, out, out!

441
00:26:22,495 --> 00:26:23,892
He's very sorry.

442
00:26:23,894 --> 00:26:25,459
Tell her how sorry you are.

443
00:26:25,461 --> 00:26:28,159
I'm sorry that I wasted
my time solving your case.

444
00:26:28,161 --> 00:26:30,993
Now, technically,
that was an apology.

445
00:26:30,995 --> 00:26:33,359
Dozens of gnomes
are in danger,

446
00:26:33,361 --> 00:26:35,393
so would you kindly step aside

447
00:26:35,395 --> 00:26:38,293
and let me continue
my investigation?

448
00:26:43,694 --> 00:26:45,126
No.

449
00:26:46,028 --> 00:26:47,325
Please.

450
00:26:47,327 --> 00:26:48,892
We just need
to take a look around.

451
00:26:48,894 --> 00:26:50,127
It's very important.

452
00:26:50,395 --> 00:26:52,628
Wait, wait, wait.
Let me explain.

453
00:26:52,961 --> 00:26:55,394
Wait. I'm warning you.
Back off!

454
00:27:05,729 --> 00:27:07,028
Guards!

455
00:27:12,262 --> 00:27:14,026
Watson, you'll have
to fend them off.

456
00:27:14,028 --> 00:27:15,326
I'm going clue hunting.

457
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,961
Right. Here we go again.

458
00:27:17,195 --> 00:27:19,093
You help Watson,
I'll help Sherlock.

459
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:21,327
- Huh? Oh, great.
- You can handle it.

460
00:27:21,329 --> 00:27:23,395
I was always more
of a dog person, anyway.

461
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:27,795
What are you looking for?

462
00:27:27,797 --> 00:27:29,927
An assistant who
asks fewer questions!

463
00:27:29,929 --> 00:27:31,161
Are you always
this rude?

464
00:27:31,163 --> 00:27:33,062
That's a question.

465
00:27:33,064 --> 00:27:34,327
A-ha!

466
00:27:34,329 --> 00:27:36,128
That should not be here.

467
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:39,797
A clock is a terribly offensive
gift in Chinese culture.

468
00:27:41,763 --> 00:27:43,329
How cryptic.

469
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:44,994
Ooh.

470
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:46,361
Classic Moriarty.

471
00:27:46,363 --> 00:27:48,395
- A plane? Is that the clue?
- "NV."

472
00:27:48,397 --> 00:27:50,263
All part of Moriarty's game.

473
00:27:50,697 --> 00:27:52,495
Curious. A different pattern.

474
00:27:52,497 --> 00:27:54,460
What's that supposed to mean?
Let me see that.

475
00:27:54,462 --> 00:27:56,594
Miss Juliet,
you must trust me.

476
00:27:56,596 --> 00:27:58,496
My methods
may be unconventional,

477
00:27:58,498 --> 00:28:00,928
but I will find
your family and friends.

478
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:03,629
Um, we should go.

479
00:28:08,197 --> 00:28:09,663
Other way!

480
00:28:17,297 --> 00:28:18,630
Suction cups.

481
00:28:20,529 --> 00:28:23,595
Paper lanterns.
That might work.

482
00:28:28,064 --> 00:28:29,396
Gnomeo!

483
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:35,396
This way. Hurry up.

484
00:28:40,297 --> 00:28:43,197
Watson, that lamp
across the street.

485
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:51,630
Put these on.
Follow me! Quickly now.

486
00:29:00,163 --> 00:29:02,297
You may want to go faster.

487
00:29:02,498 --> 00:29:03,997
Yeah, yeah.
Thanks for the tip.

488
00:29:08,998 --> 00:29:10,230
Come on!

489
00:29:15,931 --> 00:29:18,065
Come on! Bring your lanterns.

490
00:29:24,598 --> 00:29:26,996
Get ready
with those suction cups.

491
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:28,530
On my mark.

492
00:29:28,731 --> 00:29:30,064
Wait, what are we doing?

493
00:29:30,066 --> 00:29:31,565
Jumping, of course.

494
00:29:38,097 --> 00:29:39,462
Have you solved the clue?

495
00:29:39,464 --> 00:29:40,962
Where are we going next?

496
00:29:40,964 --> 00:29:44,064
I'll explain later.
Right now, just hold on.

497
00:29:47,164 --> 00:29:49,498
We'll have to jump
onto that tree!

498
00:29:56,565 --> 00:29:58,830
The Natural History Museum.

499
00:29:58,832 --> 00:30:00,962
The site of our last
showdown with Moriarty.

500
00:30:00,964 --> 00:30:03,796
Of course! That's where
the clue is leading us.

501
00:30:03,798 --> 00:30:05,430
Oh, don't be absurd.

502
00:30:05,432 --> 00:30:07,512
Moriarty would never choose
such an obvious location.

503
00:30:07,731 --> 00:30:09,897
All right, smart guy.
What's your plan?

504
00:30:09,899 --> 00:30:11,430
Well, if you must know,

505
00:30:11,432 --> 00:30:14,497
we are going to the
De Jong Modern Art Gallery.

506
00:30:14,499 --> 00:30:16,462
I haven't cracked
the latest clue yet,

507
00:30:16,464 --> 00:30:17,796
and the art helps me ruminate.

508
00:30:17,798 --> 00:30:20,064
That's your plan?
Art and thinking?

509
00:30:20,066 --> 00:30:22,264
The museum's right there.
Let's just go check it out.

510
00:30:22,266 --> 00:30:24,831
Mate, think about it. You beat
this guy in the museum, right?

511
00:30:24,833 --> 00:30:27,264
And now he wants revenge.
Don't you get it?

512
00:30:27,266 --> 00:30:29,096
He's waiting for you
at the museum,

513
00:30:29,098 --> 00:30:30,698
<i>he wants a rematch.</i>

514
00:30:44,767 --> 00:30:46,865
Plus, we can get in
right there.

515
00:30:47,932 --> 00:30:50,064
Are you...? Is he even
listening to me?

516
00:30:50,066 --> 00:30:51,164
He's not listening. Look.

517
00:30:53,099 --> 00:30:56,332
Oh, good, you stopped talking.
Now we can go to the gallery.

518
00:30:56,334 --> 00:30:58,198
You know what?
Good luck with that.

519
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,633
We're going to the museum.

520
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:02,467
Let's just go to the gallery.

521
00:31:03,134 --> 00:31:04,797
Are you serious?

522
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,931
You're seriously
choosing him over me?

523
00:31:06,933 --> 00:31:08,465
I'm not choosing anyone.

524
00:31:08,467 --> 00:31:10,731
Sherlock knows this
Moriarty guy and you don't.

525
00:31:10,733 --> 00:31:13,831
We're supposed to be a team.
Gnomeo and Juliet, remember?

526
00:31:13,833 --> 00:31:15,164
We are a team.

527
00:31:15,166 --> 00:31:16,532
Well, it doesn't
feel like it.

528
00:31:16,534 --> 00:31:18,834
It hasn't felt like it
since we moved here.

529
00:31:19,099 --> 00:31:20,765
Oh, Gnomeo.

530
00:31:20,968 --> 00:31:22,801
Are you with me or not?

531
00:31:23,866 --> 00:31:25,398
Don't do this.

532
00:31:26,401 --> 00:31:27,932
And there it is.

533
00:31:29,768 --> 00:31:31,899
Good. Now we can go
to the gallery.

534
00:31:31,901 --> 00:31:35,199
- Should we go after him?
- No! No, we should not.

535
00:31:35,201 --> 00:31:36,599
But you may.

536
00:31:36,867 --> 00:31:39,167
Oh, Sherlock Gnomes.

537
00:31:39,666 --> 00:31:41,701
Don't worry.
I'll get him back.

538
00:32:03,701 --> 00:32:05,033
Gnomeo!

539
00:32:05,367 --> 00:32:06,733
Gnomeo?

540
00:32:09,666 --> 00:32:11,298
Oh, don't make me say it.

541
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:14,134
Wherefore art thou, Gnomeo?

542
00:32:14,734 --> 00:32:16,999
- You all right, mate?
- Oh! Cheese and crackers!

543
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:18,268
Oh, it's just you, then.

544
00:32:18,566 --> 00:32:20,932
We were hoping
you'd join us at the gallery.

545
00:32:20,934 --> 00:32:22,432
Not gonna happen, mate.

546
00:32:22,434 --> 00:32:25,201
We are right about the museum.
Let's show 'em.

547
00:32:30,468 --> 00:32:31,967
Why do you keep looking back?

548
00:32:31,969 --> 00:32:33,433
He just severed
your partnership.

549
00:32:33,435 --> 00:32:35,866
We didn't break up.
It was just a fight.

550
00:32:35,868 --> 00:32:38,667
- Hmm.
- What exactly does "Hmm" mean?

551
00:32:38,669 --> 00:32:40,699
It means you were
young and in love,

552
00:32:40,701 --> 00:32:44,499
but your new garden duties were too
much for a young couple to handle.

553
00:32:44,501 --> 00:32:47,401
Likelihood of a breakup, 99%.

554
00:32:47,403 --> 00:32:49,134
Ninety-nine percent?

555
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:50,800
I rounded down.

556
00:32:52,568 --> 00:32:54,298
Look, you just focus

557
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,632
on finding my friends
and family.

558
00:32:55,634 --> 00:32:57,567
Gnomeo and I will be fine.

559
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:07,337
- Did you see that?
- No footprints. Of course.

560
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:10,602
Oh, no. Quickly.

561
00:33:13,603 --> 00:33:14,866
Look,
I know you're angry.

562
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:16,500
How would you feel?

563
00:33:16,502 --> 00:33:17,933
It's like she doesn't
even care about me!

564
00:33:17,935 --> 00:33:19,900
A partner who takes you
for granted.

565
00:33:19,902 --> 00:33:21,566
Can't think
of what that's like.

566
00:33:21,568 --> 00:33:23,000
I don't know how you put up
with that gnome.

567
00:33:23,002 --> 00:33:25,033
And if we had six months,
I'd list all his faults.

568
00:33:25,035 --> 00:33:28,401
But despite them,
he is a brilliant detective.

569
00:33:28,403 --> 00:33:31,067
We all have our good
and bad sides.

570
00:33:31,069 --> 00:33:33,002
Sherlock, Miss Juliet...

571
00:33:33,769 --> 00:33:34,903
me.

572
00:33:35,702 --> 00:33:37,468
Do you know what, mate?
You're right.

573
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:38,933
I shouldn't have left her.

574
00:33:38,935 --> 00:33:40,695
I need to go back.
I need to make this right.

575
00:33:48,269 --> 00:33:49,502
What is that?

576
00:33:50,171 --> 00:33:54,901
I'm a gargoyle, mate!
Also, your worst nightmare!

577
00:33:58,336 --> 00:33:59,569
Come here!

578
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:06,070
Go on. Run.

579
00:34:07,303 --> 00:34:10,435
You're never gonna get away
on those stubby little legs!

580
00:34:19,037 --> 00:34:20,435
Up there!

581
00:34:27,203 --> 00:34:29,002
Oi, ugly! Over here!

582
00:34:29,004 --> 00:34:30,136
Go!

583
00:34:30,138 --> 00:34:31,502
Ugly, am I?

584
00:34:31,504 --> 00:34:34,203
Gotcha.

585
00:34:34,404 --> 00:34:37,437
Do you know up close
you're actually quite handsome?

586
00:34:39,571 --> 00:34:41,805
Now. Let's go.

587
00:34:52,571 --> 00:34:54,004
Gnomeo!

588
00:35:10,238 --> 00:35:11,437
Ah!

589
00:35:17,537 --> 00:35:18,903
Watson.

590
00:35:23,205 --> 00:35:24,571
No.

591
00:35:28,638 --> 00:35:30,770
Come along, Miss Juliet.

592
00:35:33,205 --> 00:35:34,805
We must keep going.

593
00:35:36,571 --> 00:35:39,006
All those gnomes
are depending on us.

594
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:42,602
Sherlock,
I don't know what to say.

595
00:35:42,604 --> 00:35:44,470
I can't imagine
what you're feeling.

596
00:35:44,705 --> 00:35:47,905
This is the darkest day
of my career.

597
00:35:48,238 --> 00:35:52,771
I cannot believe that Moriarty
is working with gargoyles!

598
00:35:53,171 --> 00:35:54,770
Wait, what?

599
00:35:54,772 --> 00:35:57,404
As soon as this case is over,
I must retrieve Watson's map.

600
00:35:57,406 --> 00:36:01,636
That's what you care about?
Gargoyles and some stupid map?

601
00:36:01,638 --> 00:36:03,837
It's one of a kind.
In the wrong hands...

602
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:06,839
Gnomeo got taken.
He is gone!

603
00:36:07,073 --> 00:36:10,203
And Watson just got smashed.
Why aren't you sad or angry?

604
00:36:10,205 --> 00:36:13,837
Sadness and anger will not
help me save one single gnome.

605
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:16,571
Emotion
is the enemy of logic.

606
00:36:16,573 --> 00:36:18,303
That is not an answer.

607
00:36:18,305 --> 00:36:21,038
The case can't wait.
You can.

608
00:37:12,174 --> 00:37:14,107
Oh, Gnomeo.

609
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:24,539
Oi! Ronnie!

610
00:37:25,307 --> 00:37:26,672
This one's a handful.

611
00:37:26,674 --> 00:37:28,538
What, I got to babysit?

612
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,004
And you get to do
all the creeping

613
00:37:30,006 --> 00:37:31,772
and the kidnapping
and fun stuff?

614
00:37:32,008 --> 00:37:34,738
Two words, Reggie:
un... fair.

615
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:37,638
The boss likes me
more than he likes you.

616
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,673
I can't help that.

617
00:37:43,008 --> 00:37:45,140
Let me out, you big...

618
00:37:53,241 --> 00:37:54,241
Yay!

619
00:37:56,707 --> 00:37:58,006
Yay!

620
00:38:01,573 --> 00:38:03,373
- Gnomeo.
- Mum!

621
00:38:03,375 --> 00:38:04,607
Oh, thank goodness.

622
00:38:04,609 --> 00:38:06,373
Did those awful monsters
hurt you?

623
00:38:06,375 --> 00:38:07,772
Mum, I'm fine. I'm fine.

624
00:38:07,774 --> 00:38:09,973
Juliet's not with you.
Where is she? Is she okay?

625
00:38:09,975 --> 00:38:11,806
I don't know.
She's still out there.

626
00:38:11,808 --> 00:38:13,707
We split up and I need
to get back to her.

627
00:38:13,709 --> 00:38:15,274
She dumped you.
I knew it!

628
00:38:15,276 --> 00:38:17,105
I don't know why you thought
you could fix things

629
00:38:17,107 --> 00:38:18,540
with a grand
romantic gesture.

630
00:38:18,542 --> 00:38:20,140
That is just dumb.

631
00:38:20,142 --> 00:38:21,707
Talk about pulling a Gnomeo!

632
00:38:21,709 --> 00:38:23,473
Well, she didn't dump me,
no thanks to you.

633
00:38:23,475 --> 00:38:26,239
And wait. "Pulling a Gnomeo"
means doing something cool.

634
00:38:26,241 --> 00:38:27,473
Oh, yeah. Right.

635
00:38:27,475 --> 00:38:30,275
That's totally
how we all use that phrase.

636
00:38:33,075 --> 00:38:34,440
What's going on here?

637
00:38:34,442 --> 00:38:37,073
Apparently,
gnomes were going missing.

638
00:38:37,075 --> 00:38:39,107
These guys got a bit
worried about us.

639
00:38:39,308 --> 00:38:41,642
So they brought us here
for safekeeping.

640
00:38:42,841 --> 00:38:44,274
And they're gonna take us home

641
00:38:44,276 --> 00:38:46,306
after this
Fireworks Night thingy.

642
00:38:46,308 --> 00:38:49,041
Yeah, they even promised us
a "big surprise".

643
00:38:49,975 --> 00:38:51,306
And they did that
when they said it,

644
00:38:51,308 --> 00:38:52,806
which I thought seemed
a bit ominous.

645
00:38:52,808 --> 00:38:54,640
Like we weren't gonna get
a big surprise...

646
00:38:54,642 --> 00:38:57,040
or if we do, it's gonna be
something unspeakably horrific.

647
00:38:57,042 --> 00:38:58,775
But it might just be balloons.

648
00:38:59,075 --> 00:39:01,308
Oh, that's great, guys.
You go have fun.

649
00:39:01,609 --> 00:39:03,174
<i>Hola,</i> Gnomeo.

650
00:39:07,475 --> 00:39:08,940
We're in trouble.

651
00:39:08,942 --> 00:39:10,774
We know, dear. We didn't
want to worry the others.

652
00:39:10,776 --> 00:39:12,607
How bad is it?

653
00:39:12,609 --> 00:39:15,540
This guy Moriarty, he's gonna
smash us all tomorrow night.

654
00:39:15,542 --> 00:39:16,941
We're going to be smashed?

655
00:39:17,776 --> 00:39:20,174
This guy said we're all going
to be smashed tomorrow!

656
00:39:20,176 --> 00:39:21,973
Smashed?

657
00:39:21,975 --> 00:39:23,941
Well, that's not
a very good surprise.

658
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:28,243
Quiet down, now.

659
00:39:28,676 --> 00:39:30,040
You're giving me a headache.

660
00:39:30,042 --> 00:39:33,076
And I'm not very nice
with a headache.

661
00:39:42,375 --> 00:39:45,107
Come on.
Miss Juliet, I've got it!

662
00:39:45,109 --> 00:39:47,443
I've cracked...

663
00:39:50,343 --> 00:39:51,343
Oh.

664
00:39:55,743 --> 00:39:57,276
Ah. Hmm.

665
00:40:02,178 --> 00:40:04,040
...cracked the clue. I believe
I've cracked the clue.

666
00:40:04,042 --> 00:40:07,076
Oh, right up
the back of my nose.

667
00:40:09,076 --> 00:40:10,408
<i>The circle on the toy plane</i>

668
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:12,640
<i>is a symbol used
by the Royal Air Force.</i>

669
00:40:12,642 --> 00:40:14,274
<i>And the squadron code "NV"</i>

670
00:40:14,276 --> 00:40:16,641
<i>said quickly
form the word "envy,"</i>

671
00:40:16,643 --> 00:40:18,641
<i>as in "green with envy."</i>

672
00:40:18,643 --> 00:40:22,410
<i>Which gives us
"royal" and "green".</i>

673
00:40:24,044 --> 00:40:26,875
The plane itself is the
last piece of the puzzle...

674
00:40:26,877 --> 00:40:29,574
for the planatus tree,
or "plane tree",

675
00:40:29,576 --> 00:40:33,241
is the most common tree
in Royal Green Park!

676
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:36,143
It's nearly 9:00.

677
00:40:36,345 --> 00:40:38,377
We're running out of time
to save those gnomes.

678
00:40:38,611 --> 00:40:40,375
Sherlock,
it's broad daylight.

679
00:40:40,377 --> 00:40:43,076
How are we supposed to get around
a park without anyone seeing us?

680
00:40:43,078 --> 00:40:47,209
Ah, fear not. I am not just
a master of deduction.

681
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:49,942
I am also
a master of disguise.

682
00:40:51,779 --> 00:40:53,012
Sorry.

683
00:40:56,779 --> 00:40:58,009
Come on, let's go.

684
00:40:58,011 --> 00:41:01,278
Left, right. Left, right.
Now scurry.

685
00:41:01,779 --> 00:41:02,810
- Stop!
- Ooh.

686
00:41:02,812 --> 00:41:03,877
Careful.

687
00:41:04,111 --> 00:41:07,645
Now wag your tail.
Go on, wag it. Quickly.

688
00:41:07,944 --> 00:41:09,643
Wag it!

689
00:41:09,645 --> 00:41:11,710
Just when I think
you couldn't get more annoying.

690
00:41:11,712 --> 00:41:15,076
Oh, that is the least
realistic tail-wagging I have ever seen.

691
00:41:15,078 --> 00:41:16,375
Oh, forgive me.
I've never been

692
00:41:16,377 --> 00:41:18,344
the back end
of a squirrel before.

693
00:41:18,346 --> 00:41:20,143
You should have told me that before
I took you on as my assistant.

694
00:41:20,145 --> 00:41:21,509
I'm not your...

695
00:41:21,511 --> 00:41:23,044
Do you hear that?

696
00:41:28,412 --> 00:41:29,977
Hmm.

697
00:41:30,879 --> 00:41:32,410
That's not a bird.

698
00:41:32,412 --> 00:41:34,912
That's the call of
the Peruvian snapping turtle.

699
00:41:35,346 --> 00:41:37,444
Hmm. Where is it?

700
00:41:37,446 --> 00:41:38,745
A-ha!

701
00:41:39,544 --> 00:41:42,877
The Peruvian snapping turtle
is famous for burying its eggs.

702
00:41:42,879 --> 00:41:44,910
He must have buried the clue.

703
00:41:44,912 --> 00:41:47,511
Oh. It's been dug up by...

704
00:41:48,412 --> 00:41:49,542
Oh.

705
00:41:49,544 --> 00:41:50,977
Don't move.

706
00:41:50,979 --> 00:41:52,977
It's just a dog.

707
00:41:52,979 --> 00:41:55,079
That is no mere dog.

708
00:41:55,379 --> 00:41:59,080
That, my dear, is the hound
owned by the Baskervilles.

709
00:41:59,546 --> 00:42:04,245
And, in this very park,
that very hound bit me!

710
00:42:04,247 --> 00:42:05,946
And I'm siding
with the dog here.

711
00:42:06,446 --> 00:42:09,044
First Chinatown,
now this fleabag.

712
00:42:09,046 --> 00:42:11,013
This is no coincidence.

713
00:42:11,412 --> 00:42:14,478
Careful. The clue
is stuck to a squeaky toy.

714
00:42:16,147 --> 00:42:18,913
Easy does it.

715
00:42:20,446 --> 00:42:22,212
Gently.

716
00:42:22,979 --> 00:42:24,378
Got it.

717
00:42:24,613 --> 00:42:25,746
Quietly now.

718
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:28,277
And whatever you do, don't...

719
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:30,078
Oh.

720
00:42:31,879 --> 00:42:33,778
Good doggy!
Good doggy!

721
00:42:41,546 --> 00:42:44,080
- This way!
- No, this way.

722
00:42:51,147 --> 00:42:52,578
Now hold on tight.

723
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:55,546
Oh!

724
00:43:11,379 --> 00:43:13,078
Ooh! Let go!

725
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:15,979
Who's a good doggy?

726
00:43:16,279 --> 00:43:17,377
Just grab the clue!

727
00:43:17,379 --> 00:43:20,545
Got it! Uh-oh.

728
00:43:22,814 --> 00:43:25,346
There.
That wasn't so...

729
00:43:25,348 --> 00:43:28,212
Bad!

730
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:40,113
Miss Juliet,
for future reference,

731
00:43:40,115 --> 00:43:43,314
that's not how a squirrel
wags its tail.

732
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:44,580
This is.

733
00:43:45,415 --> 00:43:47,749
Do you see what I'm doing?
See? Do you see?

734
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:49,678
Yes, you're acting
like a rear end.

735
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,180
Can we check out the clue?

736
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:55,747
Of course
this would be next.

737
00:43:55,948 --> 00:43:57,948
Moriarty, you monster!

738
00:43:58,247 --> 00:44:00,813
Forcing me
to face my greatest fears!

739
00:44:01,015 --> 00:44:02,714
A button? Really?

740
00:44:03,149 --> 00:44:04,812
Very well.
If he wants to dance,

741
00:44:04,814 --> 00:44:05,980
then dance we shall.

742
00:44:08,615 --> 00:44:10,046
Hmm?

743
00:44:20,816 --> 00:44:22,578
Right. He's asleep.

744
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:24,413
There must be
a way out of here.

745
00:44:24,415 --> 00:44:27,545
The door is locked, so the
only way out is the skylight.

746
00:44:27,547 --> 00:44:29,647
But there's no way
to get up there.

747
00:44:29,649 --> 00:44:31,047
There has to be.

748
00:44:31,049 --> 00:44:32,745
I'm gonna do whatever
it takes to get us out

749
00:44:32,747 --> 00:44:34,080
and back to Juliet.

750
00:44:34,415 --> 00:44:36,515
I've got an idea.
I just need a...

751
00:44:36,915 --> 00:44:38,481
Oh, good boy, Shroom.

752
00:44:40,482 --> 00:44:41,482
All right.

753
00:44:42,616 --> 00:44:44,045
I could
scale those bricks,

754
00:44:44,047 --> 00:44:46,913
use the Goons
to swing to the beam,

755
00:44:46,915 --> 00:44:48,446
tightrope walk across it,

756
00:44:48,448 --> 00:44:50,248
reach the skylight,
get around the door,

757
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:53,547
open it from the other side
and lead everyone to...

758
00:44:53,549 --> 00:44:58,748
Freedom!

759
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:04,114
Yeah, thanks, Nanette.

760
00:45:04,116 --> 00:45:05,480
If you're going to escape,

761
00:45:05,482 --> 00:45:07,883
we'll create a distraction.

762
00:45:11,549 --> 00:45:13,614
What's going on?

763
00:45:13,616 --> 00:45:15,115
Ooh.

764
00:45:15,883 --> 00:45:18,814
He looks like
a fairy-tale princess.

765
00:45:18,816 --> 00:45:21,716
I like fairy tales.
Don't tell Reggie.

766
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:25,517
I believe we've just found our distraction.

767
00:45:26,482 --> 00:45:28,149
What?

768
00:45:30,482 --> 00:45:33,582
The button belongs
to my most formidable rival,

769
00:45:33,584 --> 00:45:36,651
the boss of the scariest
dive in London.

770
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:39,480
The Doll Museum?

771
00:45:39,482 --> 00:45:41,783
The Doll Museum!

772
00:45:47,850 --> 00:45:49,147
Gregson.

773
00:45:49,149 --> 00:45:51,148
You sure
you want to come in here?

774
00:45:51,551 --> 00:45:53,683
I need to speak to your boss.

775
00:45:58,884 --> 00:46:00,051
Your funeral.

776
00:46:08,216 --> 00:46:09,714
Yikes! Is that the boss?

777
00:46:09,716 --> 00:46:11,182
Not him.

778
00:46:14,017 --> 00:46:15,483
Nope, not him.

779
00:46:17,618 --> 00:46:18,915
Her.

780
00:46:18,917 --> 00:46:21,248
Sherlock Gnomes.

781
00:46:25,383 --> 00:46:27,850
Oh, my favorite arm.

782
00:46:28,419 --> 00:46:31,181
You got a lot of nerve
showing your face around here.

783
00:46:31,183 --> 00:46:32,582
Hello, Irene.

784
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:35,915
Well...
you're looking... well.

785
00:46:35,917 --> 00:46:39,649
A letter! You ended
our engagement in a letter.

786
00:46:39,651 --> 00:46:42,549
You two were engaged?

787
00:46:42,551 --> 00:46:44,015
And now,
after months of silence,

788
00:46:44,017 --> 00:46:45,783
you show up with this
cheap porcelain thing?

789
00:46:45,785 --> 00:46:47,449
I beg your pardon!

790
00:46:47,451 --> 00:46:49,549
She's just my assistant.

791
00:46:49,551 --> 00:46:51,015
Oh, I am not your assistant.

792
00:46:51,017 --> 00:46:53,149
Better get
your stories straight.

793
00:46:53,151 --> 00:46:54,683
Irene, this is important.

794
00:46:54,685 --> 00:46:56,315
This is one of yours,
isn't it?

795
00:46:56,317 --> 00:46:57,649
I don't know, Sherlock.

796
00:46:57,651 --> 00:46:59,616
There's an awful lot
of buttons in this city.

797
00:46:59,618 --> 00:47:02,917
Irene, please,
just hand over the clue.

798
00:47:02,919 --> 00:47:05,250
Of course.
You're only here on work.

799
00:47:05,252 --> 00:47:08,116
But your case can wait.
It's showtime.

800
00:47:08,118 --> 00:47:11,948
See if you can deduce
who this song is about. Hmm.

Well, that was
rather unpleasant.

832
00:49:00,453 --> 00:49:02,152
Really? I thought she
made some good points.

833
00:49:02,154 --> 00:49:04,752
Irene will need at least
one hour to cool down.

834
00:49:04,754 --> 00:49:07,352
We don't have an hour.
Gnomeo is still out there.

835
00:49:07,354 --> 00:49:09,919
Listen up, doll!
You've got something I need,

836
00:49:09,921 --> 00:49:11,821
and I'm not leaving here
without it.

837
00:49:12,287 --> 00:49:15,719
Are you insane? You cannot
provoke Irene like that.

838
00:49:15,721 --> 00:49:17,454
There's no telling
what she'll... Ooh!

839
00:49:23,953 --> 00:49:25,419
You can come in.

840
00:49:27,988 --> 00:49:30,587
You can't.

841
00:49:32,254 --> 00:49:33,921
Oh.

842
00:49:43,388 --> 00:49:45,051
Oh, hello.

843
00:49:45,053 --> 00:49:47,986
I thought garden gnomes were
all overweight and bearded.

844
00:49:47,988 --> 00:49:49,221
But you're actually...

845
00:49:49,821 --> 00:49:52,585
...cute. Hardly any
facial hair at all.

846
00:49:52,587 --> 00:49:54,020
Would you like some tea?

847
00:49:58,355 --> 00:50:00,685
Uh, no, thank you.
I just want...

848
00:50:00,687 --> 00:50:02,787
I've often wondered
what it's like to be a gnome.

849
00:50:03,022 --> 00:50:05,553
I mean, wearing the same
red dress every day

850
00:50:05,555 --> 00:50:07,886
would be like
a fashion prison for me.

851
00:50:07,888 --> 00:50:10,321
And living outdoors
must be awful!

852
00:50:10,555 --> 00:50:12,020
Standing outside in the rain

853
00:50:12,022 --> 00:50:14,822
and the freezing cold.
Like a dog.

854
00:50:15,022 --> 00:50:17,420
Uh, I don't really
have time for this.

855
00:50:17,422 --> 00:50:18,888
My family are in danger.

856
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:20,986
Please just
hand over the clue.

857
00:50:20,988 --> 00:50:22,287
Work, work, work.

858
00:50:22,522 --> 00:50:24,154
Now I see why
Sherlock chose you.

859
00:50:24,156 --> 00:50:25,719
Sherlock didn't "choose" me.

860
00:50:25,721 --> 00:50:27,319
And he never will.

861
00:50:27,321 --> 00:50:29,588
With Sherlock,
work always comes first.

862
00:50:29,921 --> 00:50:31,788
There's always
another case to crack,

863
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:33,422
another mystery to solve,

864
00:50:33,622 --> 00:50:35,286
another backyard
of gnomes to rescue.

865
00:50:35,288 --> 00:50:38,788
- You don't understand.
- Oh, I understand perfectly.

866
00:50:38,790 --> 00:50:40,754
Enough!

867
00:50:40,756 --> 00:50:43,187
I don't care about Sherlock!

868
00:50:43,189 --> 00:50:46,120
He is the single most
annoying gnome I've ever met.

869
00:50:46,122 --> 00:50:49,489
I wouldn't date Sherlock if he
were the last gnome on earth.

870
00:50:50,022 --> 00:50:53,555
I already have a partner,
and he's nothing like Sherlock.

871
00:50:53,557 --> 00:50:56,420
Gnomeo is reckless
and emotional.

872
00:50:56,422 --> 00:50:58,587
And he doesn't treat me
like an assistant.

873
00:50:58,589 --> 00:51:00,522
He treats me like I'm...

874
00:51:00,790 --> 00:51:03,756
the toughest gnome
in the garden.

875
00:51:04,122 --> 00:51:05,722
He believes in me.

876
00:51:05,955 --> 00:51:08,187
He loves me
with all his heart.

877
00:51:08,189 --> 00:51:09,654
And if you asked him

878
00:51:09,656 --> 00:51:13,024
to choose between me and work,
or anything really...

879
00:51:13,890 --> 00:51:15,356
he'd choose me.

880
00:51:16,089 --> 00:51:17,455
Every time.

881
00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:19,622
Hmm.

882
00:51:19,624 --> 00:51:20,988
A man doesn't make you strong.

883
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:23,522
You're right,
a man doesn't make you strong.

884
00:51:23,524 --> 00:51:26,156
But the right partner
can make you stronger.

885
00:51:26,457 --> 00:51:28,290
But I've let mine down.

886
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:30,823
And now I need
to make it right.

887
00:51:32,524 --> 00:51:35,355
All right.
I'll give you what you want.

888
00:51:35,357 --> 00:51:37,154
But only on two conditions.

889
00:51:37,156 --> 00:51:40,988
First, you tell Sherlock this had
absolutely nothing to do with him.

890
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:43,288
- And second?
- After you save the day,

891
00:51:43,290 --> 00:51:45,590
you come back
and tell me all about it.

892
00:51:46,290 --> 00:51:47,889
Well, you got a deal.

893
00:51:49,790 --> 00:51:50,953
Hmm.

894
00:51:50,955 --> 00:51:53,288
"You already know
it's all about you.

895
00:51:53,290 --> 00:51:56,758
So what is the pattern
in the final clue?"

896
00:51:57,258 --> 00:51:58,491
The patterns.

897
00:51:58,723 --> 00:52:00,756
Where are they leading us?

898
00:52:18,124 --> 00:52:19,455
<i>I've got it!</i>

899
00:52:19,457 --> 00:52:21,587
<i>Traitors' Gate
at the Tower of London,</i>

900
00:52:21,589 --> 00:52:23,823
<i>where Watson and I
solved our first case.</i>

901
00:52:24,124 --> 00:52:25,790
<i>But it's on the other side
of the city,</i>

902
00:52:25,792 --> 00:52:27,290
<i>and we're running out of time!</i>

903
00:52:27,658 --> 00:52:29,024
Let's go!

904
00:52:36,692 --> 00:52:38,955
Ladies and gentle-monsters.

905
00:52:38,957 --> 00:52:42,224
What's going on?
What are you guys doing?

906
00:52:43,125 --> 00:52:44,558
What's happening?

907
00:52:45,857 --> 00:52:47,922
All right, let's do this.

908
00:52:47,924 --> 00:52:49,689
The Royal Gnome
Theater Company

909
00:52:49,691 --> 00:52:52,924
proudly presents
<i>The Princess and the Frog.</i>

910
00:52:53,225 --> 00:52:55,225
Move out of the way.
Let me see.

911
00:52:55,426 --> 00:52:58,056
Hello!
Princess Benny is here!

912
00:52:58,058 --> 00:53:00,656
I love fairy tales.

913
00:53:00,658 --> 00:53:02,922
Written and directed by me.

914
00:53:02,924 --> 00:53:05,924
- Stage design by me. Lighting by...
- Keep going.

915
00:53:05,926 --> 00:53:09,357
Once upon a time,
a beautiful princess

916
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:11,357
tiptoed through the forest,

917
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:15,589
when she came across a prince who
had been cursed by an evil witch.

918
00:53:15,591 --> 00:53:19,623
Oh, alas! Cursed am I!
Transformed into a frog.

919
00:53:19,625 --> 00:53:22,024
Wait a second. What is
wrong with being a frog?

920
00:53:22,026 --> 00:53:24,524
Oi, Meryl Streep,
just read the lines.

921
00:53:24,526 --> 00:53:26,390
This is so frogist.

922
00:53:26,392 --> 00:53:29,992
What can lift
this terrible spell?

923
00:53:30,225 --> 00:53:32,056
You can tell
a frog didn't write this.

924
00:53:32,058 --> 00:53:34,192
Actors. Honestly.

925
00:53:37,026 --> 00:53:39,991
The only way to break
the curse was with a kiss.

926
00:53:39,993 --> 00:53:41,792
Ooh, great,
they're gonna kiss.

927
00:53:41,794 --> 00:53:44,223
Oh, no, I can't.

928
00:53:44,225 --> 00:53:45,723
Kiss the frog!

929
00:53:45,725 --> 00:53:47,658
Kiss the frog!

930
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:49,390
Why can't you kiss me?

931
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:51,091
Because
if you love someone,

932
00:53:51,093 --> 00:53:54,326
you only want to kiss them
if they want to kiss you back.

933
00:53:54,892 --> 00:53:56,857
But this isn't
the girl you love.

934
00:53:56,859 --> 00:53:58,823
It's just me! Me!

935
00:53:58,825 --> 00:54:00,924
Go on! Kiss the frog!

936
00:54:00,926 --> 00:54:03,159
It's just me. Me!

937
00:54:03,825 --> 00:54:05,457
Me, me, me!

938
00:54:05,459 --> 00:54:08,025
Me! Wait. Oh!

939
00:54:10,325 --> 00:54:12,524
Kiss the frog!

940
00:54:17,428 --> 00:54:18,759
Huh?

941
00:54:20,627 --> 00:54:22,625
What was that?

942
00:54:22,627 --> 00:54:25,757
Just then, a very
handsome suitor arrived.

943
00:54:27,593 --> 00:54:28,991
Who are you?

944
00:54:28,993 --> 00:54:31,757
I am Captain Love,
AKA The Love Machine,

945
00:54:31,759 --> 00:54:33,959
AKA Baron Von Kissy-Kissy.

946
00:54:33,961 --> 00:54:35,658
Bunnies, give me a beat.

947
00:54:38,528 --> 00:54:40,961
Watch these moves! Whoo!

948
00:54:44,859 --> 00:54:47,292
Come on, bunnies!
Let's party!

949
00:54:50,692 --> 00:54:52,192
Dance with me!

950
00:54:52,194 --> 00:54:53,294
All right.

951
00:54:54,493 --> 00:54:57,093
And whatever you
do, don't look behind you.

952
00:55:00,593 --> 00:55:01,859
Yes.

953
00:55:01,861 --> 00:55:03,728
Oh, no!

954
00:55:07,627 --> 00:55:10,095
Whoo! Party time!

955
00:55:10,794 --> 00:55:12,725
Ronnie, what is going on?

956
00:55:12,727 --> 00:55:14,259
They're putting on a show.

957
00:55:14,261 --> 00:55:17,026
Showtime's over. Bag them up!

958
00:55:17,028 --> 00:55:20,391
Boss says it's time
for their big surprise.

959
00:55:32,895 --> 00:55:34,893
We're too late.

960
00:55:35,794 --> 00:55:37,293
Where are the gnomes?

961
00:55:37,761 --> 00:55:39,994
Show yourself, Moriarty!

962
00:55:46,095 --> 00:55:49,028
No, Sherlock. Not Moriarty.

963
00:55:49,495 --> 00:55:50,828
Watson?

964
00:55:51,294 --> 00:55:53,528
But that's impossible.

965
00:55:53,861 --> 00:55:56,694
Not impossible.
Merely improbable.

966
00:55:57,028 --> 00:56:00,694
It wasn't an M.
It was a W, for Watson.

967
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:02,627
But I knew
you'd miss that.

968
00:56:02,629 --> 00:56:04,127
Because it had to do
with me.

969
00:56:04,895 --> 00:56:06,428
This was my game.

970
00:56:08,395 --> 00:56:12,060
But we saw you fall!
We saw you get smashed!

971
00:56:12,062 --> 00:56:14,929
No. You heard me
get smashed.

972
00:56:18,229 --> 00:56:20,160
I caught myself
before I landed.

973
00:56:20,162 --> 00:56:21,961
As for the sound
you heard...

974
00:56:22,196 --> 00:56:24,328
just a flowerpot.

975
00:56:24,928 --> 00:56:26,326
What have you done
with the gnomes?

976
00:56:26,328 --> 00:56:28,261
What have you done
with Gnomeo?

977
00:56:28,263 --> 00:56:30,794
They're all fine. They're
right behind that door.

978
00:56:30,796 --> 00:56:33,560
Miss Juliet, I am sorry
I had to involve your garden.

979
00:56:33,562 --> 00:56:36,930
But this was the only way
to get through to Sherlock.

980
00:56:37,562 --> 00:56:39,930
You did all this?

981
00:56:40,263 --> 00:56:41,926
But why?

982
00:56:41,928 --> 00:56:43,594
Because we used to be a team.

983
00:56:43,596 --> 00:56:47,361
Sherlock and Watson, friends,
partners in crime-solving.

984
00:56:47,363 --> 00:56:50,194
But over time,
you stopped respecting me.

985
00:56:50,196 --> 00:56:53,564
The only ornament
you respected was Moriarty.

986
00:56:54,163 --> 00:56:56,794
There was only one way
I could prove myself to you.

987
00:56:56,796 --> 00:56:59,328
I had to pretend
to be Moriarty.

988
00:56:59,763 --> 00:57:01,296
I orchestrated this game.

989
00:57:01,564 --> 00:57:03,828
I challenged you
to a battle of wits.

990
00:57:03,830 --> 00:57:06,730
And you won. You beat me.

991
00:57:07,830 --> 00:57:09,930
That's all I wanted to hear.

992
00:57:10,229 --> 00:57:13,229
And now
you and I are finished.

993
00:57:13,696 --> 00:57:16,863
Maybe you'll treat your next
partner a little better.

994
00:57:17,462 --> 00:57:19,761
Yeah, when you two
have quite finished,

995
00:57:19,763 --> 00:57:21,995
can we please
free the gnomes now?

996
00:57:21,997 --> 00:57:24,730
Of course.
With my apologies.

997
00:57:26,196 --> 00:57:27,895
Since my friends
live here at Traitors' Gate,

998
00:57:27,897 --> 00:57:30,830
this was the best place to
ensure the gnomes would be safe.

999
00:57:31,131 --> 00:57:33,661
I designed the room to be
as pleasant as possible.

1000
00:57:33,663 --> 00:57:34,763
They've even got mini-golf.

1001
00:57:35,129 --> 00:57:38,930
Gnomeo! Dad! Nanette!

1002
00:57:39,730 --> 00:57:41,029
Where are they?

1003
00:57:41,031 --> 00:57:43,395
Not here. Never were.

1004
00:57:43,397 --> 00:57:45,062
What do you mean?
What's going on?

1005
00:57:45,064 --> 00:57:47,663
Why don't you
enlighten our small friend?

1006
00:57:47,665 --> 00:57:48,895
Here's the thing, mate.

1007
00:57:48,897 --> 00:57:51,363
We, we don't actually
work for you.

1008
00:57:51,365 --> 00:57:52,830
What are you talking about?
Get off me.

1009
00:57:52,832 --> 00:57:54,397
Sherlock! Do something!

1010
00:57:55,031 --> 00:57:56,897
Look at you.

1011
00:58:01,698 --> 00:58:04,598
What a loser.

1012
00:58:08,031 --> 00:58:10,432
No. No! You can't do this.

1013
00:58:30,297 --> 00:58:33,263
What's happening?
Where are they taking us?

1014
00:58:33,499 --> 00:58:36,631
I don't know. The gnomes, they
were supposed to be there!

1015
00:58:36,999 --> 00:58:38,795
Sherlock. Sherlock!

1016
00:58:38,797 --> 00:58:42,230
For goodness sake, will you
please just say something?

1017
00:58:43,031 --> 00:58:44,295
Limestone.

1018
00:58:44,297 --> 00:58:46,230
He meant
say something useful.

1019
00:58:46,232 --> 00:58:47,531
I just did.

1020
00:58:47,533 --> 00:58:50,632
The substance on my shoe,
it's limestone.

1021
00:58:50,999 --> 00:58:52,163
The gargoyles lied.

1022
00:58:52,165 --> 00:58:53,564
They are not
from Traitors' Gate.

1023
00:58:53,566 --> 00:58:56,029
So, if we can deduce
where they're really from...

1024
00:58:56,031 --> 00:58:57,696
We'll find the gnomes.

1025
00:58:57,698 --> 00:58:59,163
That's why I kicked him.

1026
00:58:59,165 --> 00:59:01,764
To see quite literally
what he was made of.

1027
00:59:02,299 --> 00:59:04,997
The gargoyles
also reeked of salt.

1028
00:59:04,999 --> 00:59:06,930
Here, taste my shoe.

1029
00:59:06,932 --> 00:59:08,497
No. Just keep going.

1030
00:59:08,499 --> 00:59:11,029
So the gargoyles
must live close to water.

1031
00:59:11,031 --> 00:59:14,830
Now, place your hands on this wall.
Do you feel that?

1032
00:59:14,832 --> 00:59:16,962
That is the steady thrum

1033
00:59:16,964 --> 00:59:19,495
of a marine
propulsion engine, meaning...

1034
00:59:19,497 --> 00:59:20,631
We're on a ship.

1035
00:59:20,633 --> 00:59:24,230
The <i>HMS Nimrod,</i>
to be precise.

1036
00:59:24,232 --> 00:59:26,564
We've just set sail,
headed east,

1037
00:59:26,566 --> 00:59:29,997
directly towards a structure
which is both on the water

1038
00:59:29,999 --> 00:59:32,665
and protected
by limestone gargoyles.

1039
00:59:33,033 --> 00:59:36,797
Tower Bridge! The gnomes
must be hidden inside.

1040
00:59:38,433 --> 00:59:41,730
Oh, no. Now I understand
why he put us on this ship.

1041
00:59:41,732 --> 00:59:44,931
Wait. What?
Who put us on this ship?

1042
00:59:55,499 --> 00:59:58,665
That's impossible.
He was smashed. I saw it.

1043
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,931
<i>Surprise, Sherlock!</i>

1044
01:00:00,933 --> 01:00:03,931
<i>Sorry to not be in touch.
I was pretending to be dead.</i>

1045
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:05,897
<i>Oh, also, I hate you.</i>

1046
01:00:05,899 --> 01:00:07,799
Moriarty,
how awful to see you.

1047
01:00:07,801 --> 01:00:11,265
<i>So how have I been?
I've been just peachy!</i>

1048
01:00:11,267 --> 01:00:14,598
<i>Took up fishing. Gave up fishing.
It's really boring.</i>

1049
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:16,297
<i>But I did plot
your destruction</i>

1050
01:00:16,299 --> 01:00:17,966
<i>with the help
of my friends here.</i>

1051
01:00:18,232 --> 01:00:20,663
<i>Of course, they were
actually working for me!</i>

1052
01:00:20,665 --> 01:00:24,799
<i>I mean, I came up with the
Sistine Chapel of evil plans.</i>

1053
01:00:24,801 --> 01:00:27,431
<i>It's got a double-cross,
it's got a triple-cross,</i>

1054
01:00:27,433 --> 01:00:29,399
<i>I was smashed, he was smashed.</i>

1055
01:00:29,401 --> 01:00:32,464
<i>I mean, to be fair,
it is needlessly complicated,</i>

1056
01:00:32,466 --> 01:00:34,433
<i>but that's what
supervillains do!</i>

1057
01:00:34,435 --> 01:00:36,698
I know you like it when you
think I don't understand,

1058
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:39,198
but this time
I really don't understand.

1059
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,431
What happened at
the Natural History Museum?

1060
01:00:41,433 --> 01:00:44,533
<i>Well, now,
that's a funny story.</i>

1061
01:00:45,935 --> 01:00:47,732
<i>You thought I was deaded.</i>

1062
01:00:47,734 --> 01:00:49,832
<i>But I've always been
a lucky pie,</i>

1063
01:00:49,834 --> 01:00:52,598
<i>and that was
my luckiest day ever.</i>

1064
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:55,866
<i>Not only did I
not get squished,</i>

1065
01:00:55,868 --> 01:01:00,634
<i>in that moment I saw how I could
finally bring you down, Sherlock.</i>

1066
01:01:01,933 --> 01:01:04,966
<i>- Yours, I believe.
- I saw how you treated Watson.</i>

1067
01:01:04,968 --> 01:01:08,533
<i>Poor old miserabubble Watson.
He looked so sad.</i>

1068
01:01:08,535 --> 01:01:10,299
<i>So I thought, I'll use that.</i>

1069
01:01:10,301 --> 01:01:12,533
<i>I sent the gargoyles
to you, Watson,</i>

1070
01:01:12,535 --> 01:01:14,565
<i>and they let you think
you were in charge.</i>

1071
01:01:14,567 --> 01:01:16,133
<i>As if!</i>

1072
01:01:16,535 --> 01:01:18,433
<i>You know what
your problem is, Watson?</i>

1073
01:01:18,435 --> 01:01:20,065
<i>You're too nice, too trusting.</i>

1074
01:01:20,067 --> 01:01:21,864
<i>Too... ugh.</i>

1075
01:01:21,866 --> 01:01:25,665
<i>Never trust a gargoyle or
prunes past their sell-by date.</i>

1076
01:01:27,133 --> 01:01:29,565
<i>While you were playing
at supervillains,</i>

1077
01:01:29,567 --> 01:01:30,799
<i>I saw your map.</i>

1078
01:01:30,801 --> 01:01:33,698
<i>And then I could carry out
the real plan, my plan!</i>

1079
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:37,567
<i>Capturing every single gnome
in London.</i>

1080
01:01:39,268 --> 01:01:41,100
<i>Selfie time!</i>

1081
01:01:41,102 --> 01:01:42,498
Oh, no.

1082
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:44,366
<i>Oh, yes!</i>

1083
01:01:44,368 --> 01:01:46,533
<i>They didn't have to be
glued down in a giant M,</i>

1084
01:01:46,535 --> 01:01:50,568
<i>but it's the little touches that
make a plan really evil, you know?</i>

1085
01:01:51,134 --> 01:01:52,667
He's not there.

1086
01:01:52,868 --> 01:01:55,600
<i>Can you guess what happens
next? Here, I'll show you.</i>

1087
01:01:55,602 --> 01:01:58,801
<i>Screen share, screen share.
How do I screen...</i>

1088
01:02:01,736 --> 01:02:03,100
<i>This is where we stored</i>

1089
01:02:03,102 --> 01:02:04,901
<i>the kidnapped gnomes
on the bridge.</i>

1090
01:02:05,201 --> 01:02:07,000
<i>Then we brought them
to this room here,</i>

1091
01:02:07,002 --> 01:02:08,135
<i>for the main event.</i>

1092
01:02:08,401 --> 01:02:10,134
<i>And when
your warship arrives,</i>

1093
01:02:10,136 --> 01:02:12,033
<i>the bridge will rise up</i>

1094
01:02:12,035 --> 01:02:15,100
<i>and the 500-ton
counterweight will fall,</i>

1095
01:02:15,102 --> 01:02:16,933
<i>crushing the gnomes,</i>

1096
01:02:16,935 --> 01:02:18,933
<i>making you
the very instrument</i>

1097
01:02:18,935 --> 01:02:20,368
<i>of their demise.</i>

1098
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:22,435
<i>Yes, you, Sherlock,</i>

1099
01:02:22,437 --> 01:02:25,368
<i>will be the unwitting
executioner</i>

1100
01:02:25,370 --> 01:02:27,870
<i>of every single gnome
in London.</i>

1101
01:02:28,468 --> 01:02:30,234
<i>So, how do I get out
of screen share?</i>

1102
01:02:30,236 --> 01:02:31,933
<i>How do I get out of...</i>

1103
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:33,699
<i>Oh, a-ha!</i>

1104
01:02:33,701 --> 01:02:36,134
<i>Oh, Sherlock, I can see
all the cogs turning in there,</i>

1105
01:02:36,136 --> 01:02:37,835
<i>trying to work out
how to stop me.</i>

1106
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:39,134
<i>But it's too late.</i>

1107
01:02:39,136 --> 01:02:42,069
Your pretty boat
is nearly here.

1108
01:02:46,770 --> 01:02:49,033
<i>♪ The bridge will open
Smashing all the gnomes ♪</i>

1109
01:02:49,035 --> 01:02:51,901
<i>♪ And what will you do, Sherlock
When all the gnomes are gone? ♪</i>

1110
01:02:52,203 --> 01:02:54,104
I don't know. You tell me.

1111
01:02:54,403 --> 01:02:57,768
So the game is not afoot,
or a hand, or a leg.

1112
01:02:57,770 --> 01:02:59,037
It's just over.

1113
01:02:59,336 --> 01:03:00,768
And you lose.

1114
01:03:01,104 --> 01:03:02,602
Bye!

1115
01:03:10,537 --> 01:03:13,301
So, Watson,
on a scale of 1 to 10,

1116
01:03:13,303 --> 01:03:15,067
how well do you think
this is going?

1117
01:03:15,069 --> 01:03:17,669
I never meant for any gnome
to get hurt. You know that.

1118
01:03:17,671 --> 01:03:19,768
Hey, knock it off,
both of you.

1119
01:03:19,770 --> 01:03:21,535
Watson screwed up,
but you did, too.

1120
01:03:21,537 --> 01:03:23,603
- What did I do?
- The same thing I did.

1121
01:03:23,971 --> 01:03:27,234
We took our best friends for
granted, we stopped listening.

1122
01:03:27,236 --> 01:03:29,236
We stopped giving them
the respect they deserve.

1123
01:03:29,238 --> 01:03:31,201
They were the last thing
we were thinking about,

1124
01:03:31,203 --> 01:03:33,203
and they should
have been the first.

1125
01:03:39,205 --> 01:03:42,803
I suppose somewhere within that
haystack of emotional twaddle

1126
01:03:42,805 --> 01:03:46,071
there may lie
a thin needle of truth.

1127
01:03:46,437 --> 01:03:47,869
One last case.

1128
01:03:48,138 --> 01:03:50,703
One last case.

1129
01:03:51,136 --> 01:03:52,301
Good.

1130
01:03:54,538 --> 01:03:58,571
Now let's get off this ship
and save those gnomes.

1131
01:04:02,037 --> 01:04:03,470
Let's go.

1132
01:04:04,906 --> 01:04:06,337
It's all clear.

1133
01:04:09,104 --> 01:04:10,603
Follow me.

1134
01:04:11,104 --> 01:04:12,503
We need that soap.

1135
01:04:12,837 --> 01:04:15,279
Of course, to unstick
the gnomes from the pie filling.

1136
01:04:15,303 --> 01:04:16,835
Perfect deduction, Watson.

1137
01:04:16,837 --> 01:04:19,504
Now we need to find a way
to get to Tower Bridge.

1138
01:04:19,906 --> 01:04:20,939
Hmm.

1139
01:04:22,272 --> 01:04:23,571
I'll drive.

1140
01:04:28,805 --> 01:04:32,238
Uh, Miss Juliet,
maybe we should slow down!

1141
01:04:39,305 --> 01:04:40,803
What are we doing up here?

1142
01:04:40,805 --> 01:04:43,105
Shouldn't we be
saving the gnomes?

1143
01:04:43,404 --> 01:04:45,036
The only way
to save the gnomes

1144
01:04:45,038 --> 01:04:47,339
is to find a way to stop
the bridge from opening.

1145
01:04:49,406 --> 01:04:51,102
<i>Clear the bridge.</i>

1146
01:04:51,104 --> 01:04:52,536
<i>Clear the bridge.</i>

1147
01:04:52,538 --> 01:04:55,370
<i>All pedestrians
behind the barriers.</i>

1148
01:05:02,638 --> 01:05:04,937
<i>HMS Nimrod,</i>
this is Tower Bridge.

1149
01:05:04,939 --> 01:05:07,939
Commencing your
20:43 bridge lift.

1150
01:05:28,406 --> 01:05:31,272
We got to make them think there's
still people on the bridge.

1151
01:05:31,274 --> 01:05:32,605
Now, can you guys handle that?

1152
01:05:32,906 --> 01:05:35,937
Oh, absolutely, definitely.
Positively. Piece of cake.

1153
01:05:35,939 --> 01:05:38,172
Yes! I'm off to go
and help the others.

1154
01:05:38,439 --> 01:05:40,372
- So, uh, what are we doing?
- I don't know.

1155
01:05:40,374 --> 01:05:42,203
We got to do something.

1156
01:05:42,205 --> 01:05:43,571
Well, we are on a river.

1157
01:05:43,573 --> 01:05:45,138
Five, six, seven, eight!

1158
01:05:50,473 --> 01:05:52,837
Bloomin' heck! There's
still people on the bridge.

1159
01:06:00,374 --> 01:06:01,854
<i>Nimrod,</i>
stop your approach.

1160
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:05,307
<i>There are some people
on the bridge... Riverdancing!</i>

1161
01:06:06,473 --> 01:06:07,707
Sherlock!

1162
01:06:09,374 --> 01:06:11,638
And this is why you don't
make the gloating phone call

1163
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:14,206
until after all the gnomes
are smashed.

1164
01:06:14,406 --> 01:06:16,772
Can you be a lamb
and get me a weapon?

1165
01:06:16,774 --> 01:06:18,841
Something lethal
but... oh, oh, fun!

1166
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:30,138
Look! Someone must have
stopped the bridge!

1167
01:06:30,140 --> 01:06:32,307
Gnomeo.

1168
01:06:38,841 --> 01:06:41,081
"Move to the city," they said.
"It'll be fun," they said.

1169
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:44,772
Sherlock!

1170
01:06:44,774 --> 01:06:47,540
Surely you didn't think
it would be that easy...

1171
01:06:48,274 --> 01:06:49,906
Who...
Who the heck are you?

1172
01:06:49,908 --> 01:06:52,006
- I'm the gnome that's gonna...
- No!

1173
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:55,105
This is my show!
I do the one-liners.

1174
01:06:55,107 --> 01:06:56,906
You don't get one-liners.

1175
01:06:56,908 --> 01:06:58,504
It seems we have
a party crasher.

1176
01:06:58,506 --> 01:07:00,239
Would you two
show him the door?

1177
01:07:00,241 --> 01:07:01,873
It'll be our pleasure,
guvnor.

1178
01:07:01,875 --> 01:07:03,207
This is too easy.

1179
01:07:03,209 --> 01:07:06,375
- He's mine.
- No, he's mine.

1180
01:07:06,575 --> 01:07:08,274
Wait.
What are you doing?

1181
01:07:08,276 --> 01:07:09,705
Jumping, of course.

1182
01:07:13,142 --> 01:07:14,174
Gotcha.

1183
01:07:17,109 --> 01:07:21,705
Oh, Gnomeo, I'm so sorry.
I thought I'd lost you.

1184
01:07:21,707 --> 01:07:23,941
That's never gonna happen.

1185
01:07:26,408 --> 01:07:27,807
Look!

1186
01:07:29,241 --> 01:07:31,040
Ah, yes. Not good.

1187
01:07:31,042 --> 01:07:33,674
Would you mind taking care of
them so we can save the gnomes?

1188
01:07:33,676 --> 01:07:35,442
Leave it with us.
Good luck.

1189
01:07:36,707 --> 01:07:39,306
Fertilizer face!
Remember me?

1190
01:07:39,308 --> 01:07:40,573
Come here, pipsqueak!

1191
01:07:40,575 --> 01:07:42,508
Wait till I get hold of you!

1192
01:07:45,241 --> 01:07:48,207
<i>♪ My name is Moriarty
You like to eat my pies ♪</i>

1193
01:07:48,209 --> 01:07:50,973
I'll draw his fire,

1194
01:07:50,975 --> 01:07:52,640
You trust me
to save the gnomes?

1195
01:07:52,642 --> 01:07:54,908
Well, of course.
You're Watson.

1196
01:07:56,843 --> 01:07:57,875
Hmm.

1197
01:08:02,375 --> 01:08:04,040
Ah! Oh, Sherlock!

1198
01:08:04,042 --> 01:08:08,343
Surely you didn't think
it would be that easy to...

1199
01:08:08,843 --> 01:08:12,107
You know what? It
doesn't feel organic anymore.

1200
01:08:12,109 --> 01:08:14,309
Look, I'm just
gonna smash you.

1201
01:08:14,509 --> 01:08:16,973
Ha! A miss!
The first of many.

1202
01:08:16,975 --> 01:08:18,673
Oh, it's my favorite bit.

1203
01:08:18,675 --> 01:08:20,574
The chase.
Ready or not, here I come!

1204
01:08:23,143 --> 01:08:24,176
Cheese and crackers!

1205
01:08:28,210 --> 01:08:31,374
Look! It's that guy that
hangs around with Sherlock.

1206
01:08:31,376 --> 01:08:34,542
Yes, I'm the guy that
hangs around with Sherlock.

1207
01:08:34,544 --> 01:08:36,643
And I'm here to get you out.

1208
01:08:41,143 --> 01:08:42,609
Here we go.

1209
01:08:55,509 --> 01:08:57,941
Oi! Why is he
pouring soap on us?

1210
01:08:57,943 --> 01:08:59,741
I don't know.
Still, we'll smell nice.

1211
01:08:59,743 --> 01:09:01,876
He's trying to get us loose.

1212
01:09:02,644 --> 01:09:04,677
Everyone,
get ready to move.

1213
01:09:14,510 --> 01:09:17,010
Everyone link arms and pull!

1214
01:09:17,544 --> 01:09:20,342
Foam party!

1215
01:09:22,710 --> 01:09:24,909
It pains me to do this,
Sherlock.

1216
01:09:24,911 --> 01:09:27,510
No one is forcing you,
Moriarty.

1217
01:09:28,377 --> 01:09:29,975
You're the only one
who gets me.

1218
01:09:29,977 --> 01:09:32,542
<i>♪ And I know you feel
The same way about me ♪</i>

1219
01:09:32,544 --> 01:09:34,477
- Not true!
- Ow!

1220
01:09:35,577 --> 01:09:38,010
I know you, Sherlock.

1221
01:09:38,710 --> 01:09:41,075
Because I know me.
We are the same.

1222
01:09:41,077 --> 01:09:45,241
<i>♪ You are the sun
And I am the moon ♪</i>

1223
01:09:45,243 --> 01:09:46,409
Those aren't the same.

1224
01:09:46,411 --> 01:09:48,810
They're both
round things that...

1225
01:09:48,812 --> 01:09:50,144
You know what I mean.

1226
01:09:57,111 --> 01:09:59,241
They've got to be
'round here somewhere.

1227
01:09:59,243 --> 01:10:00,277
There!

1228
01:10:01,711 --> 01:10:04,011
Don't just stand there!
Get her!

1229
01:10:11,578 --> 01:10:13,245
She's trapped.

1230
01:10:18,510 --> 01:10:22,312
Oh, dear. You've got nowhere
else to go, twinkletoes.

1231
01:10:22,577 --> 01:10:24,477
Now!

1232
01:10:25,045 --> 01:10:26,409
<i>What was that?</i>

1233
01:10:26,411 --> 01:10:29,709
<i>Stevenson, point
the searchlight at the bridge.</i>

1234
01:10:29,711 --> 01:10:32,678
The humans!
They've seen us! Freeze!

1235
01:10:33,011 --> 01:10:34,709
This is your fault.

1236
01:10:34,711 --> 01:10:36,812
No, it's your fault!

1237
01:10:44,144 --> 01:10:48,209
Two garden gnomes versus
two giant stone gargoyles.

1238
01:10:48,211 --> 01:10:52,044
Hey, we're Gnomeo and Juliet.
They didn't stand a chance.

1239
01:10:52,911 --> 01:10:54,643
Oh, you've got
to be kidding me.

1240
01:10:55,312 --> 01:11:00,244
False alarm, <i>Nimrod.</i> Someone had
stuck three garden gnomes on the...

1241
01:11:00,246 --> 01:11:02,878
Looked like they were dancing.
It doesn't matter.

1242
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:05,381
Stand by for bridge reopening.

1243
01:11:05,845 --> 01:11:07,143
Oh, no.

1244
01:11:07,145 --> 01:11:08,945
Yeah, we didn't even
get to do our big finale.

1245
01:11:09,411 --> 01:11:12,611
<i>Nimrod,
recommencing bridge opening now.</i>

1246
01:11:17,846 --> 01:11:19,976
Don't worry,
I'll get you out of here.

1247
01:11:19,978 --> 01:11:21,878
Oh, my hero.

1248
01:11:23,046 --> 01:11:26,378
Be brave, my love.
Be brave!

1249
01:11:26,380 --> 01:11:28,680
This way! The door's here!

1250
01:11:30,580 --> 01:11:31,977
Come on, quickly now!

1251
01:11:31,979 --> 01:11:34,610
Help! Help! I'm stuck!

1252
01:11:34,612 --> 01:11:36,846
Well, of course
it would be that guy.

1253
01:11:43,514 --> 01:11:46,047
Whoa! Keep me level!

1254
01:11:46,647 --> 01:11:49,313
Come on, this way.
Out, everybody.

1255
01:11:50,145 --> 01:11:52,579
Yay!
Thank you, Dr. Watson.

1256
01:11:52,581 --> 01:11:55,714
- Thank you, Dr. Watson.
- You're my hero, Dr. Watson.

1257
01:12:00,846 --> 01:12:02,678
I don't need you, Sherlock.

1258
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:05,413
I've got lots of people
who want me as an archenemy.

1259
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:07,812
They're queuing up!

1260
01:12:09,813 --> 01:12:10,879
Ow!

1261
01:12:11,281 --> 01:12:13,846
I'm popular
and bubbly.

1262
01:12:20,647 --> 01:12:22,246
I'm a pie about town.

1263
01:12:26,246 --> 01:12:28,246
You know, you're
very needy for a villain.

1264
01:12:30,547 --> 01:12:33,312
The bridge is up.
The gnomes are smashed.

1265
01:12:33,314 --> 01:12:37,079
And I guess this is the end of
our little story, Sherlock.

1266
01:12:37,081 --> 01:12:39,448
Come now, Moriarty.

1267
01:12:40,014 --> 01:12:43,379
I think there's
one more twist in the tale.

1268
01:12:43,381 --> 01:12:44,446
Huh?

1269
01:12:44,448 --> 01:12:45,846
No!

1270
01:12:45,848 --> 01:12:48,180
You're past your
sell-by date, Moriarty.

1271
01:12:50,547 --> 01:12:53,312
You saved them?
My life's work ruined!

1272
01:12:53,314 --> 01:12:55,478
The Sistine Chapel
of evil plans

1273
01:12:55,480 --> 01:12:59,146
and you just spray-painted
a cartoon cat all over it!

1274
01:12:59,148 --> 01:13:02,782
Well, then, sir,
my hat's off to you.

1275
01:13:03,014 --> 01:13:04,747
Literally.

1276
01:13:04,749 --> 01:13:06,948
No!

1277
01:13:08,482 --> 01:13:10,115
Brace yourselves!

1278
01:13:13,982 --> 01:13:17,646
Oh, Sherlock.
You look tired.

1279
01:13:18,982 --> 01:13:20,347
Why don't you have
a little lie-down

1280
01:13:20,349 --> 01:13:22,180
while I go chat
to your friends.

1281
01:13:22,182 --> 01:13:25,782
Yeah. Back in a sec.

1282
01:13:26,549 --> 01:13:27,480
Whoo!

1283
01:13:27,482 --> 01:13:29,414
And lift!

1284
01:13:29,416 --> 01:13:30,414
Again!

1285
01:13:30,416 --> 01:13:32,045
Watson, behind you!

1286
01:13:32,047 --> 01:13:34,415
Hello!

1287
01:13:38,916 --> 01:13:41,082
Poor old miserabubble Watson.

1288
01:13:41,348 --> 01:13:44,181
- Okay, bye-bye!
- No, Moriarty. Please.

1289
01:13:46,115 --> 01:13:48,513
Oh, give it up, Sherlock.

1290
01:13:48,515 --> 01:13:50,515
What you gonna do?
Depress me to death?

1291
01:13:50,883 --> 01:13:53,448
This is where our story ends.

1292
01:13:54,450 --> 01:13:58,515
Come, Moriarty.
Come dance with me.

1293
01:13:58,750 --> 01:14:00,082
Oh, big hairy bums!

1294
01:14:02,015 --> 01:14:03,881
Sherlock!

1295
01:14:15,416 --> 01:14:16,449
Ow!

1296
01:14:21,416 --> 01:14:24,847
Sherlock Gnomes, I shall...

1297
01:14:24,849 --> 01:14:26,582
This water is disgusting.

1298
01:14:26,584 --> 01:14:28,649
Oh, it's going in my mouth!
It's going in my mouth!

1299
01:14:29,050 --> 01:14:30,815
Oh, no, my phone!

1300
01:14:38,149 --> 01:14:40,216
You'd give your life for me?

1301
01:14:40,716 --> 01:14:42,381
Of course.

1302
01:14:42,383 --> 01:14:44,780
Because you're the sworn protector
of London's garden gnomes.

1303
01:14:44,782 --> 01:14:46,147
No.

1304
01:14:46,149 --> 01:14:48,681
Because we are
the sworn protectors

1305
01:14:48,683 --> 01:14:50,115
of London's garden gnomes.

1306
01:14:50,117 --> 01:14:53,950
Watson and Sherlock,
partners and friends.

1307
01:14:54,283 --> 01:14:57,817
And I promise to treat
my partner a lot better.

1308
01:14:58,117 --> 01:15:02,083
That is, of course,
if you'll have me back.

1309
01:15:02,616 --> 01:15:04,416
Watson and Sherlock.

1310
01:15:04,850 --> 01:15:06,549
I rather like
the sound of that.

1311
01:15:19,483 --> 01:15:20,949
So, Benny,

1312
01:15:20,951 --> 01:15:23,147
you know how you said
you only want to kiss someone

1313
01:15:23,149 --> 01:15:24,582
if they want to kiss you back?

1314
01:15:24,584 --> 01:15:25,682
Uh...

1315
01:15:25,684 --> 01:15:28,151
Well, now is that time.

1316
01:15:31,484 --> 01:15:34,749
Where did you learn
to kiss like that?

1317
01:15:34,751 --> 01:15:36,751
The Internet.

1318
01:15:37,718 --> 01:15:40,249
Not bad for our
first week in London.

1319
01:15:40,251 --> 01:15:42,182
Well, you're the one
who wanted an adventure.

1320
01:15:42,184 --> 01:15:44,983
Yeah, with you.
Always with you.

1321
01:16:03,684 --> 01:16:06,316
What a perfect spring day.

1322
01:16:06,318 --> 01:16:09,816
The garden looks
absolutely glorious.

1323
01:16:09,818 --> 01:16:13,717
It truly does.
Juliet, I am so proud of you.

1324
01:16:13,719 --> 01:16:15,219
Thanks, Dad.

1325
01:16:20,852 --> 01:16:21,917
Watson!

1326
01:16:22,152 --> 01:16:24,982
Oh, Sherlock.
I didn't even see you there.

1327
01:16:24,984 --> 01:16:28,618
Yes.
I suppose I deserve that.

1328
01:16:36,486 --> 01:16:39,650
On this day,
the first day of spring,

1329
01:16:39,652 --> 01:16:42,683
we are here to celebrate
our new leaders,

1330
01:16:42,685 --> 01:16:45,249
Gnomeo and Juliet.

1331
01:16:48,085 --> 01:16:50,116
Is this what I think it is?

1332
01:16:50,118 --> 01:16:53,419
A Cupid's Arrow Orchid.
Our flower.

1333
01:16:57,486 --> 01:17:00,352
So I guess this is
officially our garden now.

1334
01:17:00,719 --> 01:17:05,487
It is. And I'll never forget the most
important thing in this garden is you.

1335
01:17:05,986 --> 01:17:07,950
Ooh, that was super cheesy.

1336
01:17:07,952 --> 01:17:10,616
No, it was
extremely romantic.

1337
01:17:10,618 --> 01:17:13,451
- Grade-A cheddar.
- Will you shut up and kiss me?

1338
01:17:23,420 --> 01:17:25,616
Yay! Yay!

1339
01:17:27,653 --> 01:17:28,819
What?

1340
01:17:30,153 --> 01:17:33,453
Watson, do you see how
they look at one another?

1341
01:17:33,653 --> 01:17:37,652
Recalculating likelihood
of breakup at zero percent.

1342
01:17:38,219 --> 01:17:40,119
Could that possibly
be right?

1343
01:17:40,353 --> 01:17:44,286
Elementary, my dear Sherlock.
Elementary.

1344
01:17:55,173 --> 01:18:00,178

1345
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:04,991
<i>♪ Moriarty's Pies
The taste that makes you smile ♪</i>

1346
01:24:04,993 --> 01:24:08,491
<i>♪ Filled with goobarb syrup

1347
01:25:58,496 --> 01:25:59,496
Ow!

1348
01:26:00,031 --> 01:26:02,296
I hate you, Sherlock Gnomes.
