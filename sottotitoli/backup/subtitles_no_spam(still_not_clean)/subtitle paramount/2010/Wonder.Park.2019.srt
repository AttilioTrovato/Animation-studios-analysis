1
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:35,617
<i>Mom, come on. It's time to open the park.</i>

2
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,952
<i>Oh, right. Here we go.</i>

3
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:40,871
<i>It was another day in Wonderland,</i>

4
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:44,292
<i>the most splendiferous
amusement park ever.</i>

5
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:46,707
<i>And Peanut was creating a new ride?</i>

6
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:48,208
<i>Not yet.</i>

7
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:52,922
<i>First, the mascots were getting ready
to open the gates.</i>

8
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:56,296
All right, guys.
Good morning! Let's do it!

9
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,972
Everyone, bring it in.

10
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:01,134
People love coming to Wonderland
because it's the best time ever.

11
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:03,724
And that's thanks to you.
Because who are you?

12
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:06,059
We are the wonder in Wonderland.

13
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:07,724
I can't hear you.

14
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,188
We are the wonder in Wonderland.

15
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:11,362
One more time.

16
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:14,864
We are the wonder in Wonderland!

17
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:19,035
Yes, you are! Last one to Clockwork Swings
is a rotten avocado!

18
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:23,747
Who wants to flip the switch?

19
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,937
- Why don't you go ahead, brother?
- No, you go, brother.

20
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:28,499
- No, you go.
- How about you both flip it?

21
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:48,807
Welcome! Boy, it's gonna be a great day.

22
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:52,978
I know that because we've had
literally nothing but wondrous days

23
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:54,987
since the moment we opened!

24
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:57,490
- Did you hear the joke about dehydration?
- No.

25
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:01,994
That's right, because there is absolutely
nothing funny about dehydration.

26
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:03,164
Go long!

27
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:05,540
Greta! Can we take a picture with you?

28
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:07,200
Of course. Come in.

29
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:10,875
Okay, ready? One, two, three, snort!

30
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:17,426
Gus! Cooper!
Teeter number two isn't tottering.

31
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:18,886
- We're on it.
- Copy that.

32
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,588
Beaver twin brothers, activate!

33
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:26,098
Tail slap, Coop.

34
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,604
Look, it's him!

35
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:32,354
Good morning, everyone!

36
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:34,269
You're splendiferous!

37
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,395
Peanut! Hi, Peanut!

38
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,449
Thanks for coming out.
You're a great-looking group.

39
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:46,498
Today's gonna be filled with the wonder
of this wonderful land we call

40
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,165
Wonderland!

41
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:52,253
Look at him. He's so charming!
Such a way with words.

42
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:57,300
All right, folks, who here wants to see
Peanut ride the brand new SkyFlinger?

43
00:02:58,303 --> 00:02:59,839
Terrific!

44
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,637
Room for one more in this SkyFlinger?

45
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:08,311
You might want to hold on, kid.

46
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,067
- Hi!
- Hey!

47
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,902
- Have you got your WonderChimp doll yet?
- No.

48
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:23,989
Well, what are you waiting for? Come on!

49
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,867
<i>We can play happy, happy
Won't you stay happy, happy</i>

50
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:28,990
<i>We can play happy, happy
Till we're done</i>

51
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:32,668
And here are the WonderChimps.

52
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:36,172
5,200 different outfits to pick from.

53
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:38,500
Splen-diddy-doo!

54
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:40,676
You're splendiferous!

55
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,882
What are you creating today, Peanut?

56
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:47,471
Oh, yes, that's right! Today is the day
we're opening the carousel.

57
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,385
She's gonna be a real beaut.

58
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,805
I've got the finest thoroughbred horses...

59
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:52,898
<i>Really?</i>

60
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:59,524
That sounds kinda been there, done that.

61
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,613
I think we can do better.

62
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:04,734
You're right.
I think Peanut deserves better.

63
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,657
You come up with it, Mom!

64
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,488
How could I not defer
to the young visionary

65
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,665
who came up with "The SkyFlinger"?

66
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:13,201
Hey, don't make fun of me.
I was only five.

67
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,119
I wasn't making fun of you, silly.

68
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:18,126
I just like it
when the ideas come from you.

69
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,086
Now, think.

70
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:24,003
What kind of animal should Peanut
put on your carousel?

71
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:27,556
- Fish!
- Just like any fish?

72
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:28,851
Flying fish!

73
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,643
And when you push the fin,
the fish will come to life.

74
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,805
And you could fly them all over the park.

75
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,145
Now we're talking, June.

76
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:38,736
Okay,

77
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,404
all you have to do
is give Peanut his marker,

78
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:45,491
and whisper your wish into Peanut's ear.

79
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:49,036
Now, Peanut,
here's what we want you to do.

80
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,372
You really can do that in Wonderland.

81
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:54,750
<i>Make a carousel, but instead of horses,
make flying fish.</i>

82
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,128
Okay.

83
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:04,878
Splendiferous.

84
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:20,769
Where would you like to go today?

85
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:26,027
Thank you, whoever you are,

86
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:28,280
wherever you come from.

87
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,907
And when the fish fly through
the concession stand,

88
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:32,975
people will throw popcorn in the air
to feed them.

89
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,332
So long as Boomer
doesn't eat all the popcorn first.

90
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,585
- Okay, June, time for bed.
- Oh, no!

91
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,996
A little longer? Please?

92
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,250
Nope, you've got school tomorrow.

93
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,759
And you've got a DVR
that's gonna run out of storage

94
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,257
unless we start getting serious.

95
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,921
No, don't blame the messenger.

96
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:52,843
I am just gonna have to start making
some very aggressive deletes.

97
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:53,936
You stinker.

98
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:57,017
Okay, June Bug, that's it for tonight.

99
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:02,898
Mom,

100
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:06,363
do you ever feel like Wonderland is real?

101
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:09,446
Or maybe it could be?

102
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:12,657
- Of course it could be.
- Really? How do you know?

103
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:17,747
Because I know the girl who imagined it
and she can do anything.

104
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,251
- Me?
- Oh, yeah.

105
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:20,832
Good night, June Bug.

106
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:26,842
Big day tomorrow, guys.

107
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:33,174
Time to make Wonderland real.

108
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,739
Good morning, June Bailey.

109
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,075
Banky, today is the day.

110
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:53,490
Operation Loop-De-Loop is a go!

111
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,455
But I haven't even had my morning coffee.

112
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,381
Splendiferous!

113
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:15,342
That goes under the ramp.
Yeah, more of those.

114
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:20,021
No one will miss that.
We're gonna need more nails.

115
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:23,649
Good job.
Now, that's what I'm talking about!

116
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:26,523
Great work.

117
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:37,284
They said it couldn't be done, but behold!

118
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,369
The Grand Wonder!

119
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,618
- Who said it couldn't be done?
- They.

120
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,661
- Who's "they"?
- It's just an expression.

121
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,579
Don't bust me on a technicality.

122
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,965
562 feet of track!

123
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:51,544
An intergalactic spaceport
complete with wormhole!

124
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,637
And the <i>pièce de résistance...</i>

125
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,969
That's French for "super awesome."

126
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,016
...a genuine loop-de-loop!

127
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:02,396
How high did you say the vertical drop is?

128
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,397
48.8 feet.

129
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:08,106
That's 14.87 meters for the uninitiated.

130
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:11,860
Commencing test run. All systems are a go.

131
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:16,452
- Five, four, three, two, one.
- Can we talk about this?

132
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:17,621
Launcher!

133
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,708
We have ignitialization!

134
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:31,759
Oh, no!

135
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,253
Peaches is loose!

136
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,255
Launching countermeasures.

137
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,012
Oh, gosh.

138
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,596
Engage turbo launcher!

139
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,558
Honey, have you seen my cell phone?

140
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,276
Open the spaceport.

141
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,824
- I'm trying, I'm trying!
- Duck!

142
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,036
Warp speed through a black hole.

143
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:03,036
Okay, ready to stop now.

144
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,701
No way! Time for the grand finale.

145
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,703
Firing thrusters!

146
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:18,764
Brake, brake, brake!

147
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,141
It broke, broke, broke.

148
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,155
Look out!

149
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,413
Here. Use this to pry the thrusters
on the left.

150
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,245
- Isn't that the steering wheel?
- It was. Now hurry!

151
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,661
- It's not working!
- Don't bang. Pry, pry, pry!

152
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,837
- Hurry, hurry!
- I'm trying, I'm trying!

153
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,130
I love you, June!

154
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,511
I'm alive! Thank Krishna.

155
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:09,932
That was...

156
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:11,354
...awesome!

157
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:13,269
- Did anyone video that?
- You guys rock!

158
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:14,479
I'm next!

159
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,188
Hey! What happened to my fence?

160
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,657
My garden!

161
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,699
That much for one fire hydrant?

162
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,617
My advice? Military school.

163
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:31,458
They'll drill home the kind of discipline
your daughter needs.

164
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:35,124
Don't you worry.
She will be disciplined, all right.

165
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:37,797
You got this?

166
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,174
If it means not having to be the one
to try and talk sense

167
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:43,008
into our adorable lunatic of a daughter,

168
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:44,217
you bet.

169
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:47,137
Fred! Good to see you.
How are the wife and...

170
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:54,060
The thing about military school?
It's usually far away.

171
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:55,728
Think about how much you'd miss me.

172
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:58,314
Who would really be the one
getting punished?

173
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,904
We're not sending you to military school.

174
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,568
- You're not?
- Oh, no.

175
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,436
Because military school doesn't have

176
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:06,826
nearly the amount of chores
you're gonna be subjected to.

177
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,413
I guess I walked right into that one.

178
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:12,670
What were you thinking, June?
Do you know how lucky you are?

179
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,877
Could have been a whole lot worse
than a raspberry on your elbow.

180
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:19,927
I was just listening to you.
You said Wonderland could be real.

181
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:22,095
And that I could do anything.

182
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:26,138
I never want you to stop
using your imagination, June Bug.

183
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:30,180
But I need you to also remember
to be practical and safe.

184
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:33,979
I can't imagine what I'd do
if something happened to you.

185
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,940
Even though I shouldn't have done it,

186
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:39,439
did you think what I built was cool?

187
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,573
It doesn't matter what I think.

188
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:45,449
But Gus and Cooper, on the other hand,
would've been crazy impressed.

189
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,745
Yeah.

190
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,993
But Steve would've had
a heart attack, huh?

191
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,665
Yes. Oh, yeah.

192
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,166
So,

193
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:54,704
we can keep building
more of Wonderland?

194
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,379
Yes, of course.

195
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,674
But, June,
without wrecking the neighborhood.

196
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:03,796
Right. Without wrecking the neighborhood.

197
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,195
Now, Peanut,
here's what we want you to do.

198
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:31,286
Clockwork Swings is the heart of the park.

199
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:34,042
And when it turns on,
Wonderland comes to life!

200
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:38,914
Floating through zero gravity
with astronaut June.

201
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,632
Peanut, take your marker...

202
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,088
Now turn the crank.

203
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:47,882
Look! It worked!

204
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:57,941
No, hold on!

205
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,438
No.

206
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:00,041
Bendy Straw Slide is almost done.

207
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:01,497
Look at you.

208
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:04,925
Come here, baby girl.
I want to talk to you for a minute.

209
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:09,631
I know you know Mommy's sick.

210
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,225
Yeah.

211
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,849
There are some special doctors
who might be able to help me.

212
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:19,315
But I have to go away for a while
to see them.

213
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:22,898
For how long are you going away?

214
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:25,149
Well, that just depends.

215
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:29,529
But believe me, I am gonna do
everything I can to try and get better.

216
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:31,364
Model patient.

217
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:34,238
And we'll go visit, honey.

218
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:38,709
Hey, I know this is scary,

219
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:42,709
but you keep that little light in you
shining bright.

220
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:45,298
I don't know if I can.

221
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:47,710
Well, I do.

222
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:52,340
Because you are the wonder in Wonderland.

223
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,103
Okay.

224
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:25,881
Mom.

225
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,857
Yeah, I will.

226
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,691
Are you coming home soon?

227
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:54,610
Okay. I love you, too, Mom.

228
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:09,549
<i>Keep that little light in you
shining bright.</i>

229
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:14,505
<i>What kind of animal should
Peanut put on that carousel?</i>

230
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:19,514
<i>All you have to do
is give Peanut his marker,</i>

231
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:22,437
<i>and whisper your wish into Peanut's ear.</i>

232
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,352
I can't.

233
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,309
- Hey, June.
- Hey, Banky.

234
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,307
My parents got me this drone kit.

235
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,309
We could use your help
putting it together.

236
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,642
We could use it for Wonderland.

237
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:10,026
Go on, June Bug. That'll be fun.

238
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:14,319
Is that FAA-certified
for use in a residential area?

239
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:16,825
Those things can be insanely hazardous.

240
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:19,782
Well, we're insanely bored
and, dare I say, desperate?

241
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:23,866
We've stooped to repeatedly rolling
each other down a hill for fun,

242
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,668
and I don't think
Raj can handle it anymore.

243
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:30,001
Will someone please stop the world
from spinning?

244
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,171
Great seeing you. But maybe tomorrow.

245
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:39,173
Sorry, guys. Not today.

246
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,847
Can we talk
about what's going on with you?

247
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:45,179
All they want to do
is play with Wonderland.

248
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,014
But, Dad. No! No, no, no.

249
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:49,753
Don't make this a thing. It's not a thing.

250
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:53,361
Well, it is a thing, but the thing is,
it's not a thing.

251
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,865
When you say "tomorrow,"
you mean tomorrow morning?

252
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:57,987
Just tomorrow!

253
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:00,823
Seriously?

254
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,159
- Afternoon!
- Surprise!

255
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:05,494
Heard you wanted to see
your favorite aunt and uncle.

256
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:08,749
- But they sent us instead.
- Hey-O! That's why I married her!

257
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,913
Now bring it in for the good stuff, kiddo.

258
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,003
You're getting bigger every day.
So grown up.

259
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,254
Grown up and beautiful.

260
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,944
It's good to see you, even though
you always do this to my cheeks.

261
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:19,304
The place looks great!

262
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,590
Jeez. Did you pack the whole house?

263
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:23,453
I thought you guys
were only coming for two nights.

264
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:24,718
It's just the essentials.

265
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,558
And anyway, we bought a set,
and we wanted to use all the bags.

266
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:29,644
- Get the present.
- Right.

267
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:31,270
Now, where did we put it?

268
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,773
We have a present for you, June. It's

269
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:35,695
a Ferris wheel!

270
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,236
I tried wrapping it,
but wrapping circular things

271
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,929
is much harder than I would've imagined.

272
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:44,788
I thought it would just be perfect
for your Wonderland model.

273
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:46,991
Where did all that go?

274
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:48,792
We put Wonderland away.

275
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:52,462
That's a shame. I told your mom yesterday
we'd help you build it.

276
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:55,625
- And I know your Uncle Tony!
- I'm not above playing with toys.

277
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,839
What do you say, Tiny?
Let's rebuild Wonderland.

278
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:02,138
Why don't we talk about something else?

279
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:05,176
Weather? Tax returns?
Literally, anything else.

280
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:07,143
Look what I found.

281
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:10,472
It's the blueprint for Wonderland.

282
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:12,395
I don't play with that anymore.

283
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,901
- But, sweetheart...
- Please, put that away.

284
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:16,778
- But...
- Just please!

285
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:21,483
This is a beautiful thing
you and your mom did together, darling.

286
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:24,153
To create something so real.

287
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,246
You can...

288
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:27,163
Wonderland isn't real!
It never could be real.

289
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:31,077
And even if it was, it's the last place
in the world I'd want to visit!

290
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:32,836
Oh, no.

291
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,458
Oh, Junie.

292
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,169
- Mom!
- No, wait!

293
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:49,219
I'm sorry.

294
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:50,805
Sweetie, wait.

295
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:27,970
Hey, Junie! Great news!

296
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:30,306
I said great news!

297
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,103
I'll be done in a minute!

298
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,061
Tomorrow is Math Camp!

299
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:39,486
I know it's important to clean
an already clean house,

300
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:42,568
but why don't you channel this
nervous energy into packing?

301
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,153
This is dangerous.

302
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,735
And I'm not going to Math Camp.

303
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,904
They're just gonna give me sad eyes.

304
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,368
- Junie...
- Besides, I got a lot to do around here.

305
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:54,422
Is that a three-month or six-month renewal
on your wheatgrass deliveries?

306
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:56,411
- I put in six.
- All I'm saying...

307
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:58,376
Your triglycerides
are still on the high end.

308
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:00,253
I'm not taking any chances
with your health.

309
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:02,759
June, you can't stay in here forever.

310
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,716
I just know I need to be home
this summer to take care of you.

311
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,844
Really? This expires in three days.

312
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:10,930
You're cutting it way too close.

313
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:15,014
June, today I got dressed
and made breakfast all by myself

314
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:17,399
as I have been doing
for the last 41 years.

315
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:21,942
The first seven I needed a little help,
but since then I've been okay.

316
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:30,995
I am not going to Math Camp.

317
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:38,037
Don't put the avocados
next to the bananas. They ripen too fast.

318
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,792
And leave the toaster set to three.

319
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,777
You know you don't like it
when the edges are too crispy.

320
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:43,167
My morning toast will be fine.

321
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:45,461
And the milk could be out of date,
so check it.

322
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:46,965
I'm gonna be okay.

323
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:51,642
I know this is a big step. Mom and I
are both proud of you for going.

324
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:56,605
Now get out there
on Abacus Obstacle Course and skin a knee.

325
00:21:58,234 --> 00:21:59,234
Okay.

326
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:01,486
Promise?

327
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:03,820
I promise.

328
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:16,166
- Hey ya, Banky.
- Hey, June Bailey. Saved you a seat.

329
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,745
This is gonna be the best summer ever!

330
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:21,583
Goodbye!

331
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,341
Hey, campers!

332
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:34,476
Okay, everybody here is heading
to Camp Awe Sum, right?

333
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:38,264
If you're not, you're on the rhom-bus.

334
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:42,730
I love geometry humor.

335
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:47,318
I could start off with a million stories
about my summers at Camp Awe Sum,

336
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:50,484
but I wouldn't want to go off
on a tangent!

337
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:52,994
Are you getting my angle?

338
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,741
A-one, two... A-one, two-three, four.

339
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:01,999
<i>Oh, my! Here comes pi!
3. 1415</i>

340
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:06,166
<i>A constant we all know
The famous ratio</i>

341
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:10,337
<i>Oh, my! Here comes pi!
How many can you memorize?</i>

342
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:14,383
<i>It goes on and on
A never-ending song</i>

343
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:18,596
<i>Hey, hey! It's Pi Day!
Make a circle, celebrate</i>

344
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:20,559
<i>Irrational action</i>

345
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:24,984
<i>That can't be expressed
as a simple fraction!</i>

346
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:33,318
This is a terrible mistake.
What was I thinking?

347
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,253
<i>June, I'm okay.</i>

348
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:51,299
<i>Today I got dressed
and made breakfast all by myself.</i>

349
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:03,436
Oh, no! I can't leave him alone
for an entire summer!

350
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,441
Why is the obtuse triangle...

351
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:07,523
I need your help. I need to get home.

352
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:11,280
What? Your dad'll flip!
We're talking eternal groundation.

353
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:13,279
But he knows he can't function without me.

354
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:16,786
Look at this. "Miss you."
It's like a cry for help!

355
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:20,916
I don't know, June. I think you might be
reading a bit too much into this.

356
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:23,313
I'll take the hiking trails through
the forest and be there before lunch.

357
00:24:23,337 --> 00:24:24,337
It's a no-brainer.

358
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:27,919
But first I need to get off this bus.
And you have to help me.

359
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,050
Please!

360
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,422
- Okay.
- Yes!

361
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:35,088
- Banky, I could kiss you.
- Really?

362
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:36,676
- No.
- Right.

363
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,842
Now, what can I use?

364
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,019
Okay.

365
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:44,105
- You did the school play, right?
- Does second understudy count?

366
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:46,357
Close enough. You know what to do.

367
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:53,949
Oh, no! I don't think
I'm feeling very well at this moment.

368
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:55,575
I think I might...

369
00:24:55,953 --> 00:24:57,945
I don't think I can hold it down!

370
00:24:58,288 --> 00:25:00,280
I can't hold it no more!

371
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:02,323
Oh, no! It's here!

372
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:03,954
It's here!

373
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,624
You chucked a yuck!

374
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:09,164
Stop the bus!

375
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:16,804
Okay, nobody wander off!

376
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:19,299
And watch out for snakes.

377
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:21,726
- They're everywhere.
- Snakes?

378
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:25,897
June? June? June?

379
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:28,646
Nice one, Banky. You chucked a yuck!

380
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:32,980
I got sick from a corndog once.
It hurt all the way inside of my bones.

381
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:35,656
My mom said it was because
it was two weeks old.

382
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:39,160
But I put it in the microwave
and it was delicious.

383
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:43,915
Holy hypotenuse!

384
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:47,627
- Yeah, definitely the corndog.
- Are you having heart palpitations?

385
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:13,520
Wait. Why is this here?

386
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,172
Hey, get back here!

387
00:27:43,287 --> 00:27:44,619
Gotcha!

388
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:14,710
Is this...

389
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:57,994
No way.

390
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:03,966
How is this possible?

391
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,012
Hello!

392
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:16,854
Are you...

393
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:21,935
Peanut.

394
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,028
I'm in...

395
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,027
Wonderland.

396
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:33,196
Storm clouds?

397
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:36,124
There shouldn't be storm clouds
in Wonderland.

398
00:30:36,293 --> 00:30:38,535
Boomer! We can't keep up!

399
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:42,213
Boomer the Welcome Bear? He's here, too?

400
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:47,464
Run for your life!

401
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:49,299
Grab her! Get moving, pipsqueak!

402
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:51,055
Why are we chasing Boomer?

403
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:53,557
- We're not chasing him.
- They're chasing us!

404
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,640
Regroup at Rocket Road!

405
00:30:57,731 --> 00:31:00,815
Skipping to safety, skipping to safety!
Tra-la-la-la!

406
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:06,650
Gus, gnaw that awning down.
Cooper, start the pump.

407
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:08,405
- Steve...
- I'll draft up an exit plan.

408
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:11,568
- ...you're the bait.
- Of course I am. Baiting away.

409
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:14,036
<i>Won't you stay happy, happy</i>

410
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:18,454
<i>We can't wait happy, happy
Till we play happy, happy</i>

411
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,500
Boomer, you protect her with your life.

412
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,704
What is going on around here?

413
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:24,915
What does it look like? We're at war!

414
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:28,467
War? There's no fighting in Wonderland.

415
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:31,880
Stay put. Because if they see us,
they will...

416
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:34,723
Save yourself!

417
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,556
They'll what? Boomer, finish the sentence.
They'll what?

418
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:41,264
<i>Come and play happy, happy</i>

419
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:44,775
<i>Won't you stay happy
Play happy, happy</i>

420
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:49,734
Why are they destroying the park?

421
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:51,407
Hey, you guys!

422
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,575
Over here!

423
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:56,029
Dinner is served.

424
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:58,785
Wonderland, we have a problem.

425
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,248
Steve, hold it.

426
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:04,505
Oh, dear.

427
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,543
- Hold it.
- I am holding it.

428
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:09,709
- Hold it.
- I'm literally holding it.

429
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:11,047
Hold it.

430
00:32:11,221 --> 00:32:14,555
Oh, no, I've dropped it!
I've dropped it and I left it!

431
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:17,425
I'm out of here.

432
00:32:23,233 --> 00:32:25,020
Gus, Cooper, pump the rocket!

433
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:27,189
We got to boom-shaka-boom!

434
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:31,864
Boom-shaka-boom! Boom-shaka-boom!
Boom-shaka-boom! Boom-shaka-boom!

435
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:37,453
Locked and loaded. Countdown, guys!

436
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,405
Four... Three...

437
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:42,784
Skipping to safety! Skipping to safety!

438
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:45,211
I'm almost out of danger!

439
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,871
Keep pumping, guys!

440
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:49,124
Boom-shaka-boom! Boom-shaka-boom!

441
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:52,127
So cute! But so naughty.

442
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:54,804
Now buckle up, Chimpanzombies.

443
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,134
...one!

444
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,102
World-class bait.

445
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:09,986
This isn't really happening.
I'm having a fever dream.

446
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:13,656
I'm sensitive there!

447
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,155
- Check it. Backpack!
- I smell treats!

448
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:18,823
- Dibs!
- I call dibs!

449
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:21,910
Hey! That's mine! Give it back!

450
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:25,494
- Boom, baby. Foot five!
- Foot ten!

451
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,996
- You son of a woodchip.
- Splinterface.

452
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,627
Let's have a little lookie-loo, shall we?

453
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:35,337
With a self-reminder that this
is an utter invasion of another's privacy.

454
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:36,846
Hold the roll, cutie-pie.

455
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:38,305
I surrender!

456
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:41,509
Sharp objects underfoot.
Safety Officer onsite.

457
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,177
Did you just call me cutie-pie?

458
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:45,434
The Chimpanzombies got her,
didn't they?

459
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:49,894
It's all my doing. All thanks to
a late-onset hibernation disorder.

460
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:54,026
- Go to your happy place.
- It's okay. They didn't get me.

461
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:57,317
Oh, thank heavens!
I couldn't have lived with my...

462
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:01,036
Wait, Boomer never sleeps.

463
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:02,538
Hey, watch it!

464
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:05,541
What happened to you guys? You're so...

465
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,747
I think the word you're looking for
is "pathetic."

466
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:10,413
- I didn't say that.
- You didn't have to.

467
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,502
So, you got a name, haircut?

468
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:14,174
- June.
- Hello, June.

469
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:16,711
- My name is...
- Steve. I know who you are.

470
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:19,885
- You know who we are?
- I didn't think anybody still remembered.

471
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:23,226
You guys are the wonder in Wonderland.

472
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,310
Or at least you were.

473
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:27,809
What happened to this place?

474
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,481
The Darkness happened.

475
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:32,977
It came
when Clockwork Swings began to slow.

476
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,654
- And brought with it...
- All right, bring it down, Gandalf.

477
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:37,408
Right.

478
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:39,575
Okay, here we go.

479
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:42,821
It was a day just like any other
here in Wonderland

480
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:44,910
when the strangest thing happened.

481
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:49,870
<i>Clockwork Swings, the heart of the park,
came to a dead stop.</i>

482
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:56,422
<i>And that's when we first saw it.
The Darkness.</i>

483
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:01,138
<i>It brought an evil that transformed
the WonderChimp dolls</i>

484
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:04,467
<i>into an army of Chimpanzombies.</i>

485
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:13,484
<i>Every day since,
the Chimpanzombies have waged war,</i>

486
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:18,736
<i>tearing apart the park and feeding it
piece by piece into the Darkness,</i>

487
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:21,488
<i>never to be seen again.</i>

488
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:24,366
There was nothing you could do?
Not even Peanut?

489
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:25,870
Where is Peanut?

490
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:30,292
He ventured out on his own to try
and restart Clockwork Swings by hand.

491
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,711
<i>Then why didn't he use his magic?</i>

492
00:35:34,174 --> 00:35:37,258
<i>He just said that he knew restarting
Clockwork Swings</i>

493
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:41,338
<i>was the only way to bring the life
back into Wonderland.</i>

494
00:35:42,015 --> 00:35:43,015
<i>But...</i>

495
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:54,313
And we lost any hope of turning
Clockwork Swings back on,

496
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:57,645
and one day restoring the park
to all its former glory.

497
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:00,235
- Clockwork Swings.
- Hey, whatcha got?

498
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:02,650
It's a blueprint... Of the park?

499
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:05,157
Seems like Little Miss Muffet
graffitied her name on it.

500
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:06,282
It's not graffiti.

501
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:08,285
How do you have a blueprint of Wonderland?

502
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:14,329
My mom and I invented Wonderland
when I was little,

503
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:17,999
and somehow it came to life.

504
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:22,003
That's got to be the most...

505
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:25,924
Splendiferous news ever!

506
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:27,828
Why don't you
just go back to sleep, Boomer?

507
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,343
No, I believe it in her eyes.

508
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:32,264
Because if she really is
the creator of Wonderland,

509
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:34,440
she can fix Clockwork Swings.

510
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:35,526
Well...

511
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,838
Well, that is not where I thought
this discourse was heading.

512
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,945
I was imagining that you were a...

513
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:41,279
Honeybee!

514
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,027
I'm not a honeybee.

515
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,201
Rabbit!

516
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:46,197
Steve, you're embarrassing the team.

517
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:47,329
Death!

518
00:36:47,414 --> 00:36:50,748
I am so confused right now
about what a Death Rabbit is.

519
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:55,249
Boomer, go secure the safe house.
Guys, scatter!

520
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:02,043
Buddy system! I call Greta!

521
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,298
Never mind! I call June!

522
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,972
- We got to get out of here.
- Good plan.

523
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:13,889
- Think, June. Think, think, think.
- We go in five.

524
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,565
- That could never work.
- Roger that. We run in three.

525
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,392
That couldn't possibly work.

526
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:22,610
Then we skip.
Skip like there's no tomorrow.

527
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:25,404
Welcome to Wonderland.

528
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:29,078
Skipping to safety.
Skipping... Tra-la-la-la.

529
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:31,781
- You're splendiferous!
- Splen-diddy-doo!

530
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:38,921
Skipping to, skipping to safety.

531
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:43,509
Please work, please work. When you push
the fin, the fish'll come to life!

532
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:50,766
<i>Anything can happen any day
Miracles are just a dream away</i>

533
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:52,764
<i>Happiness, happiness
There is joy in the world</i>

534
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:54,811
<i>Comes together with every boy, every girl</i>

535
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:03,521
Look out! It's right behind you!

536
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:06,573
- Would you like to stop for an ice cream?
- No! Exit!

537
00:38:06,743 --> 00:38:09,952
Keep your arms and legs
inside the ride at all times!

538
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:13,204
Not today, Chimpanzombies!

539
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:15,324
See you later.

540
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:16,784
Okay. Come back soon.

541
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:22,172
How did I get back here?

542
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:35,723
You're splendiferous!

543
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:37,180
Splen-diddy-doo!

544
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,853
Bad Chimpanzombies!
Bad Chimpanzombies!

545
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:54,248
I got you, June!

546
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:10,008
Every day is a wonderful day
in Wonderland!

547
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:11,889
My tail.

548
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:13,636
Come on, hurry!

549
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,274
Gus, Cooper,
check the north and west perimeter wires.

550
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:24,643
Steve, get to lookout
and make sure we weren't followed.

551
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:26,020
Roger that.

552
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,438
You're alive!

553
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:30,028
I was so worried,
I didn't know what to do.

554
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:31,905
I started baking marshmallow calzones.

555
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:33,452
We lost Happy Happy Land, Boomer.

556
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:36,955
- We did? Oh, my.
- That's over half the park gone now.

557
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:40,751
- What happens if we lose the other half?
- Yeah. What's gonna happen to us?

558
00:39:40,837 --> 00:39:41,953
I don't know.

559
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:44,463
- But at least we got calzones!
- And her.

560
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:47,417
Her? When the going got tough,
she ran for the exits.

561
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,967
I need to get home to my dad.

562
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,670
And if she really did create Wonderland,
whatever that means,

563
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:54,757
she would know that those exits
aren't even exits anymore!

564
00:39:54,851 --> 00:39:57,468
They were exits when my mom
and I created the park.

565
00:39:57,645 --> 00:40:00,262
Sorry I wasn't around when
this whole place went haywire,

566
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:04,100
and it became impossible to exit
from an exit marked "exit."

567
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:07,652
Did you know the verb "exit"
comes from the Latin verb <i>exeoexitum</i>

568
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:10,482
which derives
from the Greek verb <i>eximeexite?</i>

569
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:18,038
Seems I have backed into
the middle of something here.

570
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:23,119
Backing out! Beep, beep, beep...

571
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:29,839
So we know the only way to open the exits
is to get the park back up and running.

572
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:33,175
Turning on Clockwork Swings
is the key to that.

573
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:36,285
- Don't get the girl's hopes up, Boomer.
- There's no way to turn it back on.

574
00:40:36,309 --> 00:40:39,038
- Yeah, we've been there a bunch of times.
- Looked at it every which way.

575
00:40:39,062 --> 00:40:41,332
I looked at it every which way,
he just sat there eating woodchips.

576
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:43,188
- I was hungry!
- He just sat there...

577
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,336
- And sleepy.
- ...while I looked at it every which way.

578
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:49,229
But she hasn't.
And if she created it, she can fix it.

579
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:54,237
So Wonderland
is just a figment of your imagination?

580
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:55,784
Something like that.

581
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:59,705
And let me guess. That means
we're all figments of your imagination.

582
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:02,374
I wouldn't put it exactly like...

583
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:07,376
An existential crisis! I knew this day
was missing something.

584
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:12,384
Well, you can imagine this may be a little
hard for us to wrap our heads around.

585
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:16,888
Perhaps you will indulge me
with some proof?

586
00:41:17,684 --> 00:41:18,684
Fine.

587
00:41:18,768 --> 00:41:20,976
Every morning,
Steve drinks his morning tea,

588
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:22,928
2.6 grams of loose Earl Grey

589
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:26,770
to 250 milliliters of 86.1 degree water

590
00:41:26,943 --> 00:41:29,185
steeped for three minutes
and 11 seconds

591
00:41:29,362 --> 00:41:32,821
and garnished to perfection
with a spot of almond milk.

592
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:38,619
See? All hail June!

593
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:40,992
Yeah, let's not get carried away.

594
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:44,871
But I may be able to fix Clockwork Swings.

595
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:47,248
- Peanut was the glue around here.
- The glue?

596
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,751
The glue. He kept us all together.

597
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,258
These guys have suffered a lot already.

598
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:56,712
And I'm willing to follow your lead here,
because I'm running out of options.

599
00:41:56,806 --> 00:41:59,674
But you've got to promise me
there's a real shot at this.

600
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:02,635
So tell me
that you're not serving up false hope.

601
00:42:03,563 --> 00:42:07,398
Well, I was pretty good at fixing things.

602
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:10,477
But you got to get me to Clockwork Swings.

603
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,826
The Grand Wonder.

604
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:30,746
It's even bigger than I thought.

605
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:36,464
Come on, slowpokes.
The Clocks are just up ahead.

606
00:42:36,846 --> 00:42:38,553
How did you do it, June?

607
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:43,471
To create such a woman who doesn't
walk through this world. She glides!

608
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:50,517
That silken red hair.
Those come-hither tusks.

609
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:52,775
- Greta?
- What do you want?

610
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:55,528
What? No, nothing here.
Just a bit of a roll call.

611
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:57,607
"Steve!" "Present and accounted for."

612
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,066
Roll call complete.

613
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:11,078
Oh, boy.

614
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:15,295
This is a little more complicated
than the model we made.

615
00:43:22,892 --> 00:43:26,135
The hydraulics
seem to be sealed and stuff.

616
00:43:26,479 --> 00:43:28,721
No leaks or anything.

617
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:31,564
It must be
that one of the gears is jammed.

618
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:33,646
Eureka! She's fixing it.

619
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:36,023
We're witnessing a miracle.

620
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:39,733
More of a diagnosis
and certainly not a miracle,

621
00:43:39,909 --> 00:43:43,402
but it does bring us closer to a solution
than we've ever been before.

622
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:51,160
If you're trying to make a statement,
have at me, big guy.

623
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:53,628
Got to get this ride started.

624
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:56,673
I know you have the answer.
Please tell me the answer!

625
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:59,422
- Well, what does it say?
- I can't see!

626
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:01,424
My name's covering it.

627
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:04,097
- What the chuck?
- Unsplendiferous.

628
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:05,970
Not to worry! Plan B it is.

629
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:08,434
Which is what, exactly?

630
00:44:08,938 --> 00:44:10,930
Mom, why did you write on this?

631
00:44:11,107 --> 00:44:12,564
What used to be there?

632
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,516
I don't know. I got to figure this out.

633
00:44:14,694 --> 00:44:17,437
Don't do this to me, June.
It's your blueprint, isn't it?

634
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:19,817
Yeah. But it's been a while since I...

635
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:23,025
If the test were multiple choice,
I'd do much better.

636
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,030
Duck and cover! Duck and cover!

637
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:28,113
Hey, get back here!

638
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:29,998
- I got it!
- No, I got it.

639
00:44:31,294 --> 00:44:33,786
- We need that blueprint!
- Get it, Coop!

640
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:37,214
This is not fun. Boomer, for goodness...

641
00:44:42,138 --> 00:44:46,132
No! No, stop!
Fireworks Falls is a death trap!

642
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:47,682
Get off.

643
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:49,889
Stand down, I say!

644
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:56,642
We have to get it! We can't lose it.

645
00:44:56,736 --> 00:44:58,648
- Throw me! I'll get it!
- No, throw me!

646
00:44:58,738 --> 00:44:59,738
No, throw me!

647
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:02,655
- No, it was my idea!
- Oh, gosh.

648
00:45:02,742 --> 00:45:05,325
- I got it, I got it!
- Mine! You poked me in the eye!

649
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:08,177
- Your fault.
- Why is it always my fault?

650
00:45:08,748 --> 00:45:10,410
You've got to be kidding me!

651
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:11,949
Enough!

652
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:16,537
I command you to remove yourself
from this platform!

653
00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:20,671
I have been putting up with this
reckless abandon for months on end,

654
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:23,756
and it is chipping away at my soul.

655
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:26,092
I'm so very tired...

656
00:45:26,307 --> 00:45:28,048
What is that sound?

657
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:32,018
Oh, no.

658
00:45:32,772 --> 00:45:34,104
Oh, deary me.

659
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:37,016
<i>We can't wait happy, happy
To have fun</i>

660
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:41,149
Okay, fear not.
We simply must reach higher ground.

661
00:45:41,614 --> 00:45:44,698
Which is teeming with agent provocateurs
bent on our demise!

662
00:45:44,951 --> 00:45:46,692
Stop, drop and roll to Wonderland!

663
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:48,531
Fire! Fire! Fire!

664
00:45:54,377 --> 00:45:55,377
Run!

665
00:45:56,337 --> 00:45:57,669
Every man for himself!

666
00:46:18,234 --> 00:46:20,396
- Use your quills, Steve!
- Quite right.

667
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:25,150
Yeah, of course.

668
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:29,693
Everyone okay?

669
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:31,320
Wait, where's June?

670
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:34,413
- There.
- Oh, no.

671
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:37,037
Hold on, June! You'll be okay!

672
00:46:37,253 --> 00:46:38,835
Easy for you to say.

673
00:46:51,434 --> 00:46:52,766
Help!

674
00:46:57,106 --> 00:46:58,597
Thanks, Boomer!

675
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:05,820
Oh, boy!

676
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:25,925
Yeah!

677
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:27,672
- You did it!
- Well done!

678
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:30,136
Meet me at the bridge!

679
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:36,259
Or not.

680
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:45,189
Don't need to do that again.

681
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:51,112
<i>Oh, my</i>

682
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:53,034
<i>Here comes pi</i>

683
00:47:54,372 --> 00:47:55,863
<i>3. 141...</i>

684
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:02,331
Zero-G Land.

685
00:48:26,112 --> 00:48:27,353
Peanut?

686
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:30,613
Oh, my gosh! Hey, Peanut!

687
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:34,109
Where did you...

688
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:36,528
- What are you doing?
- You're alive!

689
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:39,452
- Who are you?
- A friend of Greta and Boomer.

690
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:43,039
Actually, everyone. They're gonna be
so happy. Let's go find them!

691
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:45,875
- No, no, no, no.
- Come on, I lost them at Fireworks Falls.

692
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,707
Peanut, what happened to you?

693
00:48:48,968 --> 00:48:52,336
What do you mean, what happened to me?
The Chimpanzombies had me.

694
00:48:52,513 --> 00:48:54,800
I was able to escape,
and I made it up here.

695
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:58,008
- And now you're...
- And now I'm sorting the candy.

696
00:48:58,185 --> 00:49:01,428
It was a mess when I got here.

697
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:02,772
Believe me.

698
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:05,627
I had to put the blues with the blues,
and the greens with the greens...

699
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:09,235
- If you're scared of the park...
- I'm not scared of the park. It's just...

700
00:49:09,572 --> 00:49:11,063
It's safe in here.

701
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:14,191
- But you're alone.
- Where nothing can hurt me.

702
00:49:14,285 --> 00:49:16,572
Well, you can't stay in here forever.

703
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:18,244
Says who?

704
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:20,288
There's no rules for something like this.

705
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:23,162
I know how this works.
You just wave your marker.

706
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:26,335
I wish it still worked that way.

707
00:49:26,422 --> 00:49:29,460
But you're Peanut the Splendiferous.

708
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:32,091
Splendiferous. Yeah, I used to be.

709
00:49:32,178 --> 00:49:35,387
All these amazing things
in Wonderland came from you.

710
00:49:35,473 --> 00:49:37,009
That is a lie.

711
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:39,549
I was just the middleman.

712
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:44,221
All the ideas, the inspiration,
it came from...

713
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:47,854
A voice whispering in your ear.

714
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:49,900
A woman's voice.

715
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:52,528
How do you know about that?
I never told anyone.

716
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,856
It doesn't matter.

717
00:49:55,451 --> 00:49:57,113
And not too long ago...

718
00:49:57,453 --> 00:50:00,491
The sound of her voice, it just...

719
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:02,075
...went away.

720
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:05,458
And then the Darkness took over.

721
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:08,503
I guess whoever she was,
she forgot about me.

722
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:10,080
I kept waiting.

723
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:12,777
I kept hoping she would come back
to help me fight against the Darkness,

724
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:14,758
but I just felt so...

725
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:16,506
Alone.

726
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:32,311
Peanut, there's something
I need to tell...

727
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:35,530
- Don't shush me. This is important.
- We have to go!

728
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:42,157
They found us.
They must have followed you in.

729
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:45,657
We need to move now!

730
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:49,456
Your marker!

731
00:50:49,547 --> 00:50:51,227
- Leave it. It's worthless!
- No, it's not.

732
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:52,668
Splen-diddy-doo!

733
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:54,425
Look out!

734
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:56,922
- Oh, my gosh.
- Hold on!

735
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:04,183
Splen-diddy-doo! Splen-diddy-doo!
Splen-diddy-doo!

736
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:18,531
Every day is a wonderful day
in Wonderland!

737
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:20,451
Oh, no!

738
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:22,787
Gotcha!

739
00:51:22,871 --> 00:51:24,487
It's a wonderful day in Wonderland.

740
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:26,323
There's no way out.

741
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:27,953
You're my best friend.

742
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:30,272
Every day is a wonderful day
in Wonderland.

743
00:51:30,296 --> 00:51:31,707
There is for you.

744
00:51:40,556 --> 00:51:42,138
June, go!

745
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:55,397
Guys?

746
00:51:55,988 --> 00:51:58,822
Guys? Boomer? Greta?

747
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:00,489
June! Where are you?

748
00:52:00,576 --> 00:52:01,862
Over here!

749
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:04,660
- We've been looking all over for you.
- I found Peanut.

750
00:52:04,747 --> 00:52:07,205
He was hiding in Zero-G Land.
He's alive.

751
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:08,873
- Peanut's alive?
- How brilliant!

752
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:12,543
But he was taken by the Chimpanzombies.
They're carrying him to the Darkness!

753
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:15,338
- Then let's go get him!
- But we need to rebuild that bridge.

754
00:52:15,424 --> 00:52:17,666
We could use the support posts
of the old carousel.

755
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:18,760
They're too rickety.

756
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:20,530
But it's the right idea.
What else can we use?

757
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:21,590
Got to think fast.

758
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,409
If something bad were to happen to Peanut,
I couldn't live with myself.

759
00:52:24,433 --> 00:52:25,594
What do you mean?

760
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:27,892
It's all my fault.

761
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:29,681
What's all your fault?

762
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:31,888
The Darkness.

763
00:52:32,441 --> 00:52:35,354
I think maybe I did create it.

764
00:52:35,778 --> 00:52:38,361
I didn't mean to! But I think I did.

765
00:52:38,447 --> 00:52:40,404
You created the Darkness?

766
00:52:41,033 --> 00:52:42,274
I don't understand.

767
00:52:42,368 --> 00:52:46,954
If you created Wonderland,
why would you want to destroy it?

768
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:49,531
It wasn't on purpose. I was afraid.

769
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:52,163
The Darkness took over. I tried,

770
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:56,292
but I just stopped caring about the park.

771
00:52:56,882 --> 00:52:59,249
Anyway, it doesn't matter. We can fix it.

772
00:52:59,343 --> 00:53:00,584
With this!

773
00:53:01,053 --> 00:53:04,053
If we can find a way to cross that ravine
and put it back in Peanut's hands,

774
00:53:04,098 --> 00:53:06,385
we can get Clockwork Swings
up and running.

775
00:53:06,642 --> 00:53:09,134
- Trust me. We can...
- Trust you? We've been trusting you!

776
00:53:09,228 --> 00:53:12,437
But if we knew you were the person
responsible for all this?

777
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:15,356
I never would've let us make that mistake.

778
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:18,939
Come on, guys, it's dark.

779
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:21,316
We'll figure this out on our own.

780
00:53:28,789 --> 00:53:32,408
Why would you stop...
Why would you stop caring?

781
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:34,955
What did we do wrong?

782
00:53:35,129 --> 00:53:38,293
You guys didn't do anything wrong.
You guys are amazing.

783
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,382
You created the Darkness.

784
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:51,976
Boomer.

785
00:54:08,162 --> 00:54:09,994
I'm sorry, Mom.

786
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:24,709
<i>You are the wonder in Wonderland.</i>

787
00:54:36,148 --> 00:54:39,232
Got to find a way across.

788
00:55:22,528 --> 00:55:24,520
<i>Welcome to the Grand Wonder!</i>

789
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:26,778
Sorry, Boomer.

790
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:30,863
<i>Welcome to the Grand Wonder!</i>

791
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:48,217
Now, what can I use?

792
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:53,182
Got it.

793
00:56:11,827 --> 00:56:14,194
We have ignitialization!

794
00:56:42,274 --> 00:56:44,687
"Without wrecking the neighborhood."

795
00:57:01,335 --> 00:57:04,123
I'm telling you, I don't see any way
to rebuild that bridge.

796
00:57:04,212 --> 00:57:05,703
Yeah, well, not with that attitude.

797
00:57:06,465 --> 00:57:08,832
You may want to come and see this.

798
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:10,708
Sounds like another SkyFlinger attack.

799
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,182
Stay low. Stay back.

800
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:20,681
- Dang!
- Well, I'll be Peanut's uncle!

801
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:25,852
- Is that...
- It's June!

802
00:57:27,611 --> 00:57:28,943
She did it.

803
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:32,105
She's actually done it.

804
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:34,490
Would you look at that?

805
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:57,346
So what's all this about?

806
00:57:57,432 --> 00:58:00,266
It's time to bring Wonderland
back to life.

807
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:01,934
What?

808
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:05,771
I know I let you down.
But I want to make it right.

809
00:58:05,857 --> 00:58:09,817
- How do you know it'll work?
- Because I built this place.

810
00:58:10,612 --> 00:58:12,148
My mom and I did.

811
00:58:12,406 --> 00:58:15,615
But she got sick and had to stop.

812
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:18,113
And I got scared.

813
00:58:19,538 --> 00:58:22,781
So scared of losing her
that I lost myself.

814
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:26,209
And she would hate to see how I changed.

815
00:58:26,795 --> 00:58:28,286
How we've all changed.

816
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:30,464
Now, buckle up!

817
00:58:30,549 --> 00:58:32,632
We're gonna ride that coaster
like the wind.

818
00:58:32,801 --> 00:58:33,801
Who's with me?

819
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:36,593
- I'm with you, June.
- We are all with you.

820
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:38,137
Yeah, that's right.

821
00:58:39,433 --> 00:58:40,549
I still believe in you.

822
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:44,393
I'm more of a "two feet on the ground"
kinda guy.

823
00:58:44,479 --> 00:58:47,392
There's a weight restriction on that ride,
isn't there?

824
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:49,269
Come on, Boomer.

825
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:51,976
There is absolutely no way...

826
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:53,070
Oh, no.

827
00:58:53,155 --> 00:58:54,521
...I will ev...

828
00:58:56,324 --> 00:58:57,531
We got this.

829
00:58:57,701 --> 00:58:59,738
Too many marshmallow calzones.

830
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:10,958
Hey, guys.
I had that weird kidnapping dream again.

831
00:59:11,048 --> 00:59:12,584
I wonder what it means.

832
00:59:19,014 --> 00:59:23,304
Boomer! We'll be right up!
Greta just has to get the other cart!

833
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:24,759
I want to be down.

834
00:59:24,853 --> 00:59:27,937
- Only one way down!
- Yeah, fly like a bird, bro.

835
00:59:28,023 --> 00:59:31,266
But I'm not a bird! Birds are terrifying,
with those beaks,

836
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:33,316
and those talons,

837
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:35,269
and influenza type A!

838
00:59:42,954 --> 00:59:45,697
Come on, Greta.
You guys did block the wheels, right?

839
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:47,783
That's what this is for!

840
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:49,750
Guys!

841
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:55,214
What are the odds?

842
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:57,007
Astronomically small.

843
00:59:57,427 --> 01:00:00,545
No, no, no. No!

844
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:03,593
Oh, terrific.

845
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:07,142
Oh, gosh, he's looking at me.

846
01:00:07,646 --> 01:00:09,182
Oh, no, no.

847
01:00:10,774 --> 01:00:11,981
Get out of here.

848
01:00:13,235 --> 01:00:17,320
Nice birdie. Oh, hey! I hear your friends!

849
01:00:21,243 --> 01:00:22,654
Please don't move.

850
01:00:22,828 --> 01:00:24,239
You're not lis...

851
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:43,258
Oh, no. No, no, no.

852
01:00:46,893 --> 01:00:48,429
You were supposed to wait!

853
01:00:49,229 --> 01:00:51,332
He's going the wrong way!
If we don't turn Boomer around...

854
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:53,939
He'll be fried like a funnel cake!

855
01:00:54,192 --> 01:00:56,605
Gus, Cooper!
Drop the upper track to the lower one,

856
01:00:56,695 --> 01:00:57,922
and we'll reroute Boomer to safety.

857
01:00:57,946 --> 01:00:58,946
On it!

858
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:01,467
We'll need some kind of rope,
something strong to stop him with.

859
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:02,491
Got it.

860
01:01:22,387 --> 01:01:24,128
Get me off of this thing!

861
01:01:24,973 --> 01:01:26,509
We're not gonna make it!

862
01:01:30,228 --> 01:01:32,345
- Oh, man.
- At least we got dinner.

863
01:01:34,649 --> 01:01:35,935
Oh, no!

864
01:01:36,568 --> 01:01:38,275
- Licorice?
- That's what we got.

865
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:41,529
Steve, fire this to Boomer
and we'll use it to slow him down.

866
01:01:41,615 --> 01:01:42,776
Roger that.

867
01:01:44,910 --> 01:01:47,402
Boomer! Catch the rope!

868
01:01:47,579 --> 01:01:48,579
Okay!

869
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:52,407
Range, 400 meters.
Winds, three knots southwest. Ready...

870
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:53,741
Help, help, help!

871
01:01:53,835 --> 01:01:54,835
...aim...

872
01:01:55,629 --> 01:01:56,629
...fire!

873
01:02:01,885 --> 01:02:02,885
Nuts.

874
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:04,409
- Well, that didn't work.
- Ya think?

875
01:02:05,305 --> 01:02:06,796
Make it stop!

876
01:02:07,432 --> 01:02:08,968
Wait, we could all still get across.

877
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:10,929
Okay, everybody, pull tight!

878
01:02:16,775 --> 01:02:17,775
Keep pulling.

879
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:28,568
This is beginning to feel like
a terrible turn of events for us all.

880
01:02:28,662 --> 01:02:29,778
I'm with him.

881
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:32,947
Brace for impact!

882
01:02:36,211 --> 01:02:38,077
I'm ready to wake up now,
ready to wake up.

883
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:39,378
You are awake, Boomer.

884
01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:43,337
I'm awake?
I mean, I'm awake! We did it.

885
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:46,043
- You did it.
- I did it. I mean... I did it?

886
01:02:46,137 --> 01:02:48,379
- You da man!
- You're the man-bear!

887
01:02:48,473 --> 01:02:50,715
I'm the man!

888
01:02:50,809 --> 01:02:52,050
You're the man,

889
01:02:52,143 --> 01:02:55,978
and we are just the various members of the
animal kingdom with the power of speech

890
01:02:56,064 --> 01:02:58,351
hanging next to the man.

891
01:02:58,441 --> 01:02:59,977
Yes, you are.

892
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:03,440
You're splendiferous!

893
01:03:07,951 --> 01:03:10,193
<i>Play happy
Stay happy</i>

894
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:12,866
<i>We can't wait happy, happy
To have fun, fun, fun, fun</i>

895
01:03:13,123 --> 01:03:14,739
<i>Play happy
Stay happy</i>

896
01:03:16,126 --> 01:03:18,083
Holy cheesy chips!

897
01:03:18,253 --> 01:03:19,869
Oh, crikey!

898
01:03:22,257 --> 01:03:23,373
Peanut.

899
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:28,677
We're too late.

900
01:03:38,982 --> 01:03:42,146
Oh, gosh. What do we do now?

901
01:03:42,402 --> 01:03:44,769
- Not "we."
- What do you have in mind, kid?

902
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:46,812
It's about what I need to do.

903
01:03:47,198 --> 01:03:51,192
I need to go into the Darkness
and bring Peanut back.

904
01:03:51,286 --> 01:03:53,448
- What? No!
- What's she talking about?

905
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:58,411
June...

906
01:03:58,877 --> 01:04:02,746
It's too powerful. Nothing ever comes out.

907
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:05,164
I got this, Greta.

908
01:04:26,446 --> 01:04:29,234
I am the wonder in Wonderland.

909
01:04:31,201 --> 01:04:33,693
I am the wonder in Wonderland.

910
01:04:35,955 --> 01:04:39,949
I am the wonder in Wonderland!

911
01:05:04,025 --> 01:05:06,768
Peanut? Where are you?

912
01:05:07,237 --> 01:05:09,524
June? Is that you?

913
01:05:09,948 --> 01:05:11,564
Peanut! Hold on!

914
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:17,830
June?

915
01:05:18,123 --> 01:05:19,123
Peanut!

916
01:05:29,467 --> 01:05:32,301
- Are you okay? Are you hurt?
- I'm so sorry they got you, too.

917
01:05:32,387 --> 01:05:33,844
You've got to get us out of here.

918
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:37,890
I wish I could. But I told you,
my inspiration, she left me.

919
01:05:38,226 --> 01:05:39,717
She's never coming back.

920
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:45,265
You don't know that. She's out there,
trying to get back to us.

921
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:48,730
- Us?
- Yeah.

922
01:05:49,279 --> 01:05:54,274
She's my mom, and if there's one thing
I know, it's that she is not giving up.

923
01:05:54,868 --> 01:05:56,609
So neither should we.

924
01:05:56,911 --> 01:05:58,277
Without her,

925
01:05:59,122 --> 01:06:01,114
I'll never create again.

926
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:02,782
Yes, you will.

927
01:06:03,042 --> 01:06:07,252
Don't give in to the fear. Your light
is stronger than the Darkness.

928
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:09,918
- Now take this.
- But without her...

929
01:06:10,008 --> 01:06:12,341
You don't have to worry
about that anymore.

930
01:06:12,427 --> 01:06:13,793
What do you mean?

931
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:15,131
Because...

932
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:17,304
I'm here.

933
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:21,888
Peanut, build us the biggest slide
in the whole wide world

934
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:24,436
and make it out of bendy straws.

935
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:32,148
Now let's get out of here.

936
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:34,317
Bendy straws?

937
01:06:35,492 --> 01:06:38,326
That sounds like a splendiferous idea!

938
01:06:38,495 --> 01:06:40,236
Coming right up.

939
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:51,250
Quick, make another one!

940
01:06:58,681 --> 01:07:00,343
To Clockwork Swings!

941
01:07:03,186 --> 01:07:04,267
Look.

942
01:07:04,437 --> 01:07:06,099
- She's doing it!
- They made it!

943
01:07:06,272 --> 01:07:07,979
- Well, slap my tail.
- Tally ho!

944
01:07:08,942 --> 01:07:09,942
Oh, dear.

945
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:17,322
- We've got to help them.
- That we do. Hang on, June!

946
01:07:24,541 --> 01:07:25,782
Well done!

947
01:07:25,959 --> 01:07:27,871
Guess I owe you guys an explanation.

948
01:07:28,211 --> 01:07:29,952
We're just happy you're alive.

949
01:07:30,129 --> 01:07:32,837
And since you are,
how about you get those clocks started

950
01:07:32,924 --> 01:07:34,290
and bring our park back to life?

951
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:36,922
It's the least I can do! But how?

952
01:07:39,681 --> 01:07:41,047
Wait a minute.

953
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:46,018
My name. My park, my name.

954
01:07:46,479 --> 01:07:50,598
Greta, if we all end up crashing to our
collective deaths, I just want you to know

955
01:07:50,692 --> 01:07:53,275
I burn for you, baby! I burn hot!

956
01:07:53,361 --> 01:07:55,398
My oven is on extra <i>fuego!</i>

957
01:07:57,615 --> 01:07:59,481
I think you're cute, too, Steve.

958
01:07:59,576 --> 01:08:03,240
Wait, what? What did she say?
What did she say?

959
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,321
The gears.

960
01:08:05,456 --> 01:08:08,540
Mom, you weren't writing over the clocks,
you were telling me how to fix it.

961
01:08:08,626 --> 01:08:10,583
How to jumpstart the clocks back to life!

962
01:08:11,129 --> 01:08:13,872
Write my name!
Turn the gears by writing my name!

963
01:08:13,965 --> 01:08:15,831
The gears! Hold on, everybody!

964
01:08:19,804 --> 01:08:21,295
It's working, it's working!

965
01:08:23,641 --> 01:08:24,757
- Oh, no!
- Watch it!

966
01:08:25,226 --> 01:08:26,226
Hold on!

967
01:08:27,687 --> 01:08:28,687
Look out!

968
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:30,808
Keep going!

969
01:08:33,318 --> 01:08:34,934
Go, go, go! We need the "U."

970
01:08:38,906 --> 01:08:40,863
Welcome to Wonderland!

971
01:08:41,993 --> 01:08:43,609
Now right, right!

972
01:08:44,537 --> 01:08:45,948
Beaver twin brothers, activate!

973
01:08:48,166 --> 01:08:49,498
Tail to the face!

974
01:08:49,667 --> 01:08:51,374
Okay, now the "N." Hurry!

975
01:08:54,881 --> 01:08:56,167
Launch me, Greta.

976
01:08:56,257 --> 01:08:57,589
- Launch you?
- Launch me.

977
01:08:57,675 --> 01:09:00,042
For Wonderland! For Greta!

978
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:02,469
For freedom!

979
01:09:07,685 --> 01:09:08,801
Nailed it.

980
01:09:09,395 --> 01:09:10,476
We got this, June.

981
01:09:11,105 --> 01:09:12,266
You ready?

982
01:09:12,649 --> 01:09:13,730
Jump!

983
01:09:38,466 --> 01:09:41,675
Look, the park! It's coming back to life!

984
01:09:49,769 --> 01:09:51,101
Tail slap, Cooper!

985
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:53,179
Well done! A cracking job!

986
01:09:56,734 --> 01:09:58,225
You're splendiferous!

987
01:10:02,281 --> 01:10:05,024
Look who's back to being WonderChimps.

988
01:10:05,118 --> 01:10:08,180
- Do a little dance. Do your little dance.
- Do your little WonderChimp dance.

989
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:09,411
Look how cute they are!

990
01:10:19,716 --> 01:10:22,129
Come on, Boomer.
There's guests to welcome.

991
01:10:22,218 --> 01:10:24,756
And things to build.
And people to take care of.

992
01:10:24,846 --> 01:10:25,846
Quite right.

993
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:28,468
And now that we've got our glue back,
nothing can stop us.

994
01:10:28,558 --> 01:10:31,096
Me? The glue? No, I'm not the glue.

995
01:10:31,185 --> 01:10:34,098
- You're the glue, Greta.
- You always have been.

996
01:10:34,188 --> 01:10:36,430
- Isn't that right, gang?
- Yeah!

997
01:10:36,524 --> 01:10:37,981
You guys.

998
01:10:38,484 --> 01:10:41,397
Come on, let's go spread some wonder!

999
01:10:41,487 --> 01:10:43,194
- Yeah, that's how we do it.
- Me first!

1000
01:10:44,115 --> 01:10:45,115
Wait.

1001
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:47,657
- What about you, June?
- Yeah, what about you?

1002
01:10:47,744 --> 01:10:50,987
Well, I probably should be getting home.

1003
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:54,039
You're leaving?
What are we gonna do without you?

1004
01:10:55,835 --> 01:10:58,669
You're gonna do what you always do.

1005
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:01,212
Come on, bring it in.

1006
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:06,385
You have everything you need right here.

1007
01:11:06,471 --> 01:11:08,303
Because who are we?

1008
01:11:09,015 --> 01:11:11,598
We are the wonder in Wonderland.

1009
01:11:12,059 --> 01:11:14,176
I can't hear you!

1010
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:16,933
We are the wonder in Wonderland.

1011
01:11:17,023 --> 01:11:19,265
One more time!

1012
01:11:19,358 --> 01:11:22,476
We are the wonder in Wonderland!

1013
01:11:23,321 --> 01:11:24,562
Now fall out.

1014
01:11:24,655 --> 01:11:26,237
Welcome!

1015
01:11:26,324 --> 01:11:29,283
Boy, it's gonna be a great day.

1016
01:11:37,418 --> 01:11:38,750
Let's do this thing!

1017
01:11:38,836 --> 01:11:40,293
Good to go.

1018
01:11:40,379 --> 01:11:41,995
Wait for it...

1019
01:11:46,344 --> 01:11:47,551
The Darkness.

1020
01:11:47,929 --> 01:11:49,340
It's still there.

1021
01:11:49,764 --> 01:11:52,632
Maybe it'll never really fully go away.

1022
01:11:52,934 --> 01:11:55,096
Maybe it's there to remind us

1023
01:11:55,186 --> 01:11:58,805
to look at the light that surrounds us.

1024
01:12:00,191 --> 01:12:03,559
Please enjoy our newest attraction,
Bendy Straw Slide,

1025
01:12:03,653 --> 01:12:07,818
which I have personally safety tested
under extreme conditions.

1026
01:12:07,907 --> 01:12:10,945
Speaking of the light
that surrounds you...

1027
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:13,701
Steve!

1028
01:12:14,121 --> 01:12:15,578
Here we are.

1029
01:12:15,998 --> 01:12:18,581
Come on, I'll let you buy me some popcorn.

1030
01:12:18,668 --> 01:12:21,911
Yep, I'll be right there!
I just need to... Well...

1031
01:12:22,839 --> 01:12:25,047
Wait for my heart to settle.

1032
01:12:32,223 --> 01:12:34,055
You'll hear me in the wind.

1033
01:12:34,475 --> 01:12:35,716
I know I will.

1034
01:12:35,810 --> 01:12:38,598
And we'll be here for you. Always.

1035
01:12:38,688 --> 01:12:39,929
Hey, Peanut!

1036
01:12:41,566 --> 01:12:44,024
This place really is splendiferous!

1037
01:12:45,111 --> 01:12:46,272
Yep.

1038
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:49,404
Splendiferous!

1039
01:13:13,598 --> 01:13:15,760
We got asparagus, spinach, brussels...

1040
01:13:16,559 --> 01:13:18,721
There you are, my hidden sweet.

1041
01:13:23,274 --> 01:13:24,274
Dad!

1042
01:13:24,817 --> 01:13:25,978
June Bug?

1043
01:13:26,861 --> 01:13:29,569
June, are you okay?
What happened to you?

1044
01:13:29,655 --> 01:13:33,399
I'm so sorry for being gone a whole night
and not telling you where I was.

1045
01:13:33,492 --> 01:13:36,485
What? I just dropped you off
at Math Camp 30 minutes ago.

1046
01:13:38,456 --> 01:13:39,788
Never mind.

1047
01:13:45,296 --> 01:13:47,288
If you did this
because you're worried about me...

1048
01:13:47,381 --> 01:13:49,213
Worry? About you?

1049
01:13:49,717 --> 01:13:51,049
You're fine!

1050
01:13:51,886 --> 01:13:53,718
Actually, you're awesome.

1051
01:13:56,265 --> 01:13:58,302
I have so much to tell Mom about.

1052
01:14:00,728 --> 01:14:01,728
Junie...

1053
01:14:01,812 --> 01:14:04,372
And before you bring up going back
to Math Camp, you have to know

1054
01:14:04,398 --> 01:14:07,232
it's not happening.
I have way too much work to do.

1055
01:14:07,318 --> 01:14:09,856
- Such as?
- Making up for lost time.

1056
01:14:10,655 --> 01:14:11,862
Is that...

1057
01:14:25,795 --> 01:14:27,878
The neighborhood will love this.

1058
01:14:28,214 --> 01:14:30,547
Junie, I'm home!
I got the rest of the supplies.

1059
01:14:30,633 --> 01:14:33,296
Hey, Dad! Just a few more...

1060
01:14:33,386 --> 01:14:35,719
Honey, my hands are full.
Can you get that?

1061
01:14:36,555 --> 01:14:37,841
Sure thing, Dad.

1062
01:14:39,225 --> 01:14:41,968
I strung up all the banners. What's next?

1063
01:14:42,061 --> 01:14:45,725
Great. Can you make a balloon arch
over the back fence?

1064
01:14:45,815 --> 01:14:46,896
- Yep!
- Thanks.

1065
01:14:49,902 --> 01:14:52,986
When you say over the back fence,
do you mean

1066
01:14:53,072 --> 01:14:57,032
over the fence, like over it,
or over the fence, like behind it?

1067
01:14:57,118 --> 01:14:59,155
Over the fence, like over it.

1068
01:14:59,578 --> 01:15:02,036
Ding! Over the fence. Got it.

1069
01:15:05,584 --> 01:15:08,918
Tell Banky to just put it
behind the fence. I got to finish.

1070
01:15:09,005 --> 01:15:11,463
I think you should get the door, June.

1071
01:15:12,091 --> 01:15:13,252
But...

1072
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:28,440
Mom.

1073
01:15:29,942 --> 01:15:31,604
What are you waiting for?

1074
01:15:32,153 --> 01:15:33,439
Come here.

1075
01:15:41,203 --> 01:15:42,739
I'm glad to see you.

1076
01:15:43,622 --> 01:15:44,954
Are you...

1077
01:15:45,291 --> 01:15:47,157
I'm okay now, June Bug.

1078
01:15:48,961 --> 01:15:50,202
So am I.

1079
01:15:50,796 --> 01:15:54,210
It looks like
you kept your little light shining bright.

1080
01:15:54,592 --> 01:15:57,710
I've got a story
even you might not believe.

1081
01:15:58,596 --> 01:15:59,712
Try me.

1082
01:16:03,809 --> 01:16:07,553
Now that is splendiferous!

1083
01:16:15,154 --> 01:16:17,316
Hey, Clockwork Swings!

1084
01:16:19,158 --> 01:16:23,027
Come on! Wonderland is now open!

1085
01:16:34,465 --> 01:16:35,797
<i>You're splendiferous!</i>

1086
01:16:46,310 --> 01:16:50,099
Okay, everyone.
It was another day in Wonderland,

1087
01:16:50,189 --> 01:16:53,682
the most splendiferous amusement park
in the world.

1088
01:16:54,026 --> 01:16:57,440
Peanut is excited to create a new ride.

1089
01:16:58,531 --> 01:17:00,944
Anyone have any suggestions?

1090
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:03,525
Yes, yes, yes!

1091
01:17:03,786 --> 01:17:04,947
June! June!

1092
01:17:05,037 --> 01:17:06,699
Banky, what are you thinking?

1093
01:17:06,789 --> 01:17:09,247
- A Ferris wheel!
- That's a great idea.

1094
01:17:09,333 --> 01:17:13,168
But are we thinking just like
a regular old Ferris wheel?

1095
01:17:13,254 --> 01:17:15,997
A Ferris wheel made out of glow sticks.

1096
01:17:16,090 --> 01:17:18,332
A Ferris wheel that flies!

1097
01:17:18,425 --> 01:17:22,715
A flying Ferris wheel made of glow sticks.
That's a great idea.

1098
01:17:22,805 --> 01:17:26,048
I think Peanut
needs to hear about this right away.

1099
01:17:26,725 --> 01:17:29,934
Now, Peanut,
here's what we want you to do.

1100
01:17:30,104 --> 01:17:32,312
Take your marker and create...

1101
01:17:32,481 --> 01:17:34,473
That's wonderful. Wonderful.

1102
01:17:34,692 --> 01:17:36,809
<i>...made out of glow sticks.</i>

1103
01:17:37,570 --> 01:17:38,981
Glow sticks?

1104
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:44,734
Sounds like a splendiferous idea!

1105
01:17:45,077 --> 01:17:46,284
Coming right up!
