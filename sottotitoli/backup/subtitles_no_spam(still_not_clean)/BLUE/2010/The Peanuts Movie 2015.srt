1
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,556
Ah, Beethoven.

2
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:45,079
Linus, time to get up.

3
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,551
You don't want to be
late for school.

4
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,031
Get up!

5
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,273
My blanket!

6
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,440
Hello?

7
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:56,841
Snow day?

8
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,435
Snow day!

9
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,714
No school today!

10
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,993
Dreams do come true!

11
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,279
No school!

12
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:12,797
Franklin and Peppermint Patty
are on my team!

13
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,032
I got my hockey stick!
I got my skates!

14
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,237
Who has the pucks?

15
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,920
Looking sharp today, Pigpen.

16
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,071
Sorry I'm late.

17
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,999
What's taking him so long?

18
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,073
Come on, Charlie Brown!

19
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,394
No.
Not quite. That's the one!

20
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,915
I've got my kite!

21
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,317
Today's the day.
I can feel it!

22
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,756
A kite? Today?

23
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,150
In the middle of winter?

24
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,357
Come on, guys!

25
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,274
Only Charlie Brown.

26
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,910
A new kite, a perfect breeze.

27
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,640
It all feels just right.

28
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:54,516
Now that the Kite-Eating Tree
is sleeping for the winter...

29
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,115
we have nothing to fear.

30
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,476
Lift off!

31
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,311
Wait a minute.

32
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,394
It's in the air.
It's flying! Hey, guys!

33
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:13,757
Look! Look, I did it!

34
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,399
Oh!

35
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,077
Hey, Charlie Brown.

36
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,959
Still no luck?

37
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,760
Remember, it's the courage

38
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,559
to continue that counts!
Whoa!

39
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,510
Runaway kite!

40
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,550
Sorry!

41
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,671
No brakes!

42
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:39,960
And now,
for my famous triple Axel!

43
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,999
Prepare to be amazed!

44
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,875
Ooh!

45
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,759
A quadruple!
Bravo!

46
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,311
Whoa!

47
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:53,156
Stupid Kite-Eating Tree.

48
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,270
Good grief.

49
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,640
You blockhead!

50
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,434
I should have known.

51
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,400
What kind of a person
tries to fly a kite

52
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,234
in the middle of winter?

53
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,199
Don't you ever know
when to give up?

54
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:11,194
You will never
get that kite to fly.

55
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:15,241
Why?
Because you're Charlie Brown!

56
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:21,671
Thanks, Linus.

57
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:22,991
Listen, Charlie Brown.

58
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,437
Ignoring what my sister
Lucy says

59
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:27,638
has enabled me to make it
this far in life.

60
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:30,555
What would I do without
a good friend like you?

61
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:31,790
Whoa!

62
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:34,911
Whoa!

63
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,636
Aw, my Sweet Babboo!

64
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,511
Isn't he the cutest thing?

65
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:45,797
Careful, sir!

66
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,674
Watch the curls!

67
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,271
Whoa!

68
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,440
I don't care what Lucy says.

69
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:24,196
I may have had troubles
in the past flying a kite...

70
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:26,557
and I may have never
won a baseball game...

71
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,071
but it's not
for the lack of trying.

72
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,120
My pitching has to improve

73
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:34,160
if I come out here
to my trusty mound every day.

74
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:41,438
Charlie Brown is not a quitter.

75
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,678
Bottom of the 9th. Two outs.

76
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:55,754
A strike-out here would make
the pitcher an instant hero.

77
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,999
It all comes down
to this one pitch.

78
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,437
Let's see if you can handle
my fastball.

79
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,712
Ol' Number One. The Heater.

80
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,110
The Brown Bullet.

81
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,511
Woo-hoo!

82
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:47,394
It's going to be a long winter.

83
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,511
Someone's moving in

84
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:57,670
across the street from me?

85
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,950
Hey, gang, look!
There's a new kid moving in!

86
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,992
Big brother,
pull yourself together!

87
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,879
Come on, Charlie Brown!

88
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:06,032
Get out of the way!
Hey, guys.

89
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,870
What do you see? Who is it?

90
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,071
Oh, I think I see a piano!
I hope he loves Beethoven!

91
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,840
Beethoven, Schmeethoven.

92
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:16,313
Maybe he will appreciate
my natural beauty.

93
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:17,631
Who cares about that?

94
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,752
As long as he's a better
goalie than Marcie.

95
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,116
You're hurting me, sir.

96
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,840
I'm sorry, but it's true.

97
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,799
No, you're pulling on my hair!

98
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,480
I just hope he'll have
an open mind

99
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:27,591
about the Great Pumpkin.

100
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,320
I think they have a toaster!

101
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,799
I just hope this
new kid has never heard of me.

102
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:35,800
He would know nothing
of my past imperfections.

103
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,318
It's not often
you get the opportunity

104
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,432
to start over
with a clean slate.

105
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,758
This time,
things will be different.

106
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,116
Whoa!

107
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,797
He did it!

108
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,111
Snoopy...

109
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:07,638
why is it that everything
I try turns out wrong?

110
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:10,760
Sometimes I wonder
if the kids really like me.

111
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:15,041
Maybe that new kid will see me
for who I really am, like you.

112
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:18,478
A dog doesn't try
to give advice or judge you.

113
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,832
They just love you
for who you are.

114
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,311
It's nice to have someone

115
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,432
that will just sit
and listen to you.

116
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:30,991
Man's best friend.

117
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:34,954
You can't come to school,
Snoopy.

118
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:37,636
Now be a good dog and go home.

119
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,074
No dogs allowed!

120
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:58,521
I think I saw the new kid.

121
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:59,916
Did you see
that moving truck arrive?

122
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,958
Who do you suppose it will be?

123
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,555
The new kid is coming!

124
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:05,957
That's not the new kid.

125
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,680
Hey, Charlie Brown.

126
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,438
Good morning, Linus.
What do you have there?

127
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,433
It's my turn
for show and tell today.

128
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:18,594
This is the same plane flown
by Manfred von Richthofen.

129
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,240
Who?
The Red Baron.

130
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:23,121
The most famous aviator
during The Great War.

131
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:24,551
It's not real, is it?

132
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,870
Aah! My naturally curly hair!

133
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,713
Duck, Linus! Whoa!

134
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:43,478
Yikes!

135
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,637
Yes, Miss Othmar.

136
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:51,831
Sir?

137
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:53,871
Sir.

138
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,631
Sir!

139
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,280
Two! No, three!

140
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:58,711
Was I close?

141
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,998
Class hasn't started yet, sir.

142
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:05,516
What? The new kid
is joining our class.

143
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:13,632
She doesn't look
like a goalie to me.

144
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,195
Wow! She's pretty.

145
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:17,159
She's not that pretty.

146
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:24,754
Linus.
She looked at me!

147
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:37,440
Aww, not the yearly
standardized test again!

148
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,194
Ma'am, will this test

149
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:41,390
accurately reflect the
knowledge we have gained here?

150
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:45,441
Is it fair we,
at this young age...

151
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:47,711
Yes, ma'am.

152
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:54,950
Thanks.

153
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:56,350
Question 1.

154
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,791
"If you had
6 red tomatoes and..."

155
00:10:58,950 --> 00:10:59,951
Aw...

156
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,470
Red.

157
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,075
Come on, focus.

158
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,712
First impressions
are everything.

159
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,594
No dogs!

160
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,636
Already done?

161
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,554
She must be smart.

162
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:16,511
It's got teeth marks.

163
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,758
She nibbles on her pencil
like I do.

164
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:21,554
We have something in common!

165
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:23,991
One minute left?

166
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,236
Out of my way, Chuck!

167
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:37,558
Write our names? Yes, ma'am.

168
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:43,115
Chuck, are you trying to
hold my hand?

169
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:44,960
You sly dog.

170
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,270
Ooh!

171
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:49,477
Uh, hi, I'm Brown Charlie.

172
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,394
I mean, "Barnie Clown."

173
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,750
I mean...

174
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:00,241
What are you in for?

175
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:03,473
Have you ever had that feeling
when you can't stop smiling?

176
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:07,470
Your heart pounds
inside your chest?

177
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:10,440
You try to stand
but your knees become weak?

178
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,712
And then that
Little Red-Haired Girl

179
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,713
glances at you.
Whoa!

180
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:18,157
And all of life's possibilities

181
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,153
become so clear.

182
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:21,751
And then you realize...

183
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:26,279
...she has
no idea you're alive.

184
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,597
Why am I here?

185
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,718
Because I just came down

186
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,838
with a serious case
of inadequacy.

187
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:35,719
Here she comes.

188
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,634
This is my chance
to make a good impression.

189
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,200
Maybe tomorrow.

190
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:28,040
It was a dark and stormy night.

191
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:33,072
High above
the French countryside...

192
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:37,355
the World War I Flying Ace
had never been so close...

193
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:38,911
to his lifelong enemy...

194
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:41,511
the infamous Red Baron.

195
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:52,431
Shh.

196
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:07,311
The key
is keeping a low profile.

197
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:09,832
For now,
we just keep our distance.

198
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,832
Snoopy!

199
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,151
No!

200
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,351
Oh!

201
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:24,358
That was a close one.

202
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:35,512
If I could only work up the
nerve to go over there, I'd...

203
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,240
What are you looking at,
big brother?

204
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,358
Are you crazy?

205
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,311
Oh.

206
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:44,233
You're in love!

207
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,393
Chapter 1.

208
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:59,514
It was the greatest love story
ever told.

209
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,874
Her name was Fifi.

210
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:37,958
She was the most beautiful thing

211
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,680
he had ever seen.

212
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,191
Yuck!

213
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:11,233
I can't believe
I'm about to talk

214
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,159
to the Little Red-Haired Girl.

215
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,596
It's moments like this

216
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,758
when you need
your faithful friend.

217
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:25,551
Yep.

218
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:27,513
If there's one person
you want by your side

219
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:28,751
at a moment like this...

220
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:31,073
it's your loyal dog.

221
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,510
Hello?

222
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,400
Hello?

223
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,231
She said, "Hello"!

224
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:04,039
Charlie Brown!

225
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:06,511
What brings you out here
so late in the day?

226
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,912
I need your advice
on girls, Lucy.

227
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,401
You're a girl, right?

228
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:14,321
Let's just say there's this
girl I'd like to impress.

229
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:16,916
But she's something
and I'm nothing.

230
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,033
If I were something
and she was nothing,

231
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,396
I could talk to her.

232
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:22,279
Or, if she was nothing
and I was nothing,

233
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:23,596
I could talk to her.

234
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,799
But she's something
and I'm nothing,

235
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,799
so I just can't talk to her.

236
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:30,952
You're being ridiculous,
Charlie Brown.

237
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,799
You have much to offer.

238
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:34,111
She has a pretty face

239
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:36,073
and pretty faces
make me nervous.

240
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:38,836
Pretty face? Pretty face?

241
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:40,276
I have a pretty face!

242
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:42,632
How come my face
doesn't make you nervous?

243
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:45,441
How come you can talk to me,
Charlie Brown?

244
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:52,193
I just need to know the secret
to winning her heart.

245
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:55,191
Look into this mirror,
Charlie Brown.

246
00:21:55,630 --> 00:22:00,158
This is the face of failure.
A classic failure face.

247
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:02,517
Do you think girls like
failures, Charlie Brown?

248
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:03,796
Well, no.

249
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,197
Girls want someone
with proven success.

250
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:08,000
Have you won any awards?

251
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:10,232
Like a Congressional
Medal of Honor?

252
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:12,039
Or a Nobel Peace Prize?

253
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,440
What are your
real estate holdings?

254
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:16,080
Do you have
a diversified portfolio?

255
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:20,319
Let me let you in on a little secret,
Charlie Brown.

256
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:22,831
If you really want to
impress girls,

257
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:25,521
you need to show them
you're a winner.

258
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:27,160
A winner? Me?

259
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:29,796
Lucy, you may be
on to something.

260
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:32,317
Of course, when I say "you,"

261
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:34,358
you know I don't mean
you personally.

262
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:39,353
That will be five cents, please.

263
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:48,400
Nickels, nickels, nickels.
What a beautiful sound.

264
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:51,076
"Congratulations.
You're now on your way

265
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,191
"to becoming a winner.

266
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:56,116
"Step 1. Forget everything
you ever knew about yourself."

267
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:59,518
Okay. "Step 2.

268
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,360
"Project confidence.

269
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:03,121
"Don't slouch.

270
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:09,159
"Maintain eye contact
at all times."

271
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:27,872
Yeehaw!

272
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:30,915
Giddy-up, little pony!

273
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,754
Yeehaw!

274
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:34,271
What are you doing?

275
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:37,957
I'm going to be a rodeo star
in the big talent show.

276
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:40,272
When I win
that first-prize ribbon...

277
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:42,080
there will be no one
who hasn't heard the name...

278
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:44,961
Sally Brown and her
trusty horse, Broomstick!

279
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:49,791
Win the talent show.
Now that's a great idea.

280
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:52,601
This is just what Lucy
was talking about.

281
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:04,271
Ha-ha!

282
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:10,711
Ta-da!

283
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:23,831
Ha!

284
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:31,911
Ha-ha!

285
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:35,636
We're ready.

286
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:53,356
Whoa! Look at that.

287
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:55,434
Is that Charlie Brown?

288
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:56,511
Whoa!

289
00:24:58,790 --> 00:24:59,791
Whoa!

290
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,796
She's here.

291
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:09,679
I have a really good feeling
that tonight

292
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:11,792
she will see
the new Charlie Brown.

293
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:13,801
Charlie Brown?

294
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:17,158
As your psychiatrist,
I'm surprised to see you here.

295
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,557
A person
with all your insecurities

296
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:21,832
normally wouldn't enter
a talent show.

297
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:23,355
I'm...

298
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:26,678
I ought to slug you!

299
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:31,635
Ugh! I've been kissed by a dog!
I have dog germs!

300
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:33,952
Get hot water!
Get some disinfectant!

301
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,520
Get some iodine!

302
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:38,476
Let's keep this thing moving.
Time's a-wasting.

303
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:46,040
Thank you!

304
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:47,919
Break a leg, Chuck!

305
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:52,150
Treat your assistant kindly,
Charles.

306
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:54,674
Okay, Sally,
we're running behind,

307
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,514
so gallop, don't trot!

308
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:01,431
Save the applause
for the end, everyone.

309
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:05,716
If you like this,
wait for the encore!

310
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:12,080
Your sister
is really dying out there.

311
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:14,751
Hey, that's not a real horse!

312
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:22,760
Sorry, Charlie Brown.
This has gone on long enough.

313
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:24,071
Drop the curtain!

314
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:26,597
Don't do that.
She said she has a big finish.

315
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,593
Well, it's either
your act or hers.

316
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:30,394
We can't hold forever.

317
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:43,394
Change of plans, Snoopy.

318
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:45,431
Wow.

319
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:48,791
Moo.

320
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:51,121
Moo.

321
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:55,315
Big brother?

322
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,556
Rope me.

323
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:59,758
- Moo.
- That's not a real cow.

324
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:07,120
I'm gonna get you!

325
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,111
Woo-hoo!

326
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:18,631
Hi...
Hi-ya!

327
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:20,717
Sorry, sir.

328
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:21,791
Good one.

329
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:23,759
Oh, Schroeder...

330
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:25,673
Woo-hoo!

331
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:32,792
You can run, little dogie,
but you can't hide!

332
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:39,318
This is going great!
Yee-haw!

333
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:43,157
My name is Calamity Sally...

334
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:45,355
the best bronc-busting,

335
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:48,474
lasso-roping cowgirl
in this here town!

336
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:55,511
Thanks, big brother.

337
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:00,511
Whoa, whoa!

338
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:04,881
"Moo"?

339
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:08,155
Nobody reads
the school paper anyhow.

340
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:14,039
Look on the bright side,
Charlie Brown.

341
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:17,040
They say there's no such thing
as bad publicity.

342
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:18,351
You're right, Linus.

343
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:20,837
She definitely knows
who I am now.

344
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:27,081
You know, Charlie Brown,
if you like her so much...

345
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:30,154
why not just walk up to her
and introduce yourself?

346
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,550
After the complete fool

347
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:33,513
I made out of myself last night?

348
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:37,038
Yeah, and why don't I just
fly to the moon?

349
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:43,034
Oh, brother.
She's talking to them?

350
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:45,671
So much for a fresh start.

351
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:48,272
Time is running out.

352
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:50,396
"Number 6.

353
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:53,554
"Tell yourself,
'lam worthy. I can do this.

354
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:55,350
"'I have what it takes." '

355
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:56,876
Hello?

356
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:01,441
Your girlfriend's on the phone.

357
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,071
Hello?
Hey, Chuck.

358
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:07,277
This is Peppermint Patty.

359
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:08,955
How have you been?
Well, I...

360
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:11,397
Listen, I have some great news
for you, Chuck.

361
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:13,240
The Winter Dance
is in a few weeks...

362
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:15,711
and I'm saving a dance for you.

363
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:17,918
Anyway, Marcie put me in charge

364
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,236
of the refreshment committee.

365
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:20,591
I took it upon myself

366
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:22,633
and signed you up to
make the cupcakes.

367
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:25,396
You did what?
I can't cook cupcakes.

368
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:28,030
The only thing I do know
how to make is toast.

369
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:30,915
Besides, why would I even
want to go to the Winter Dance?

370
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:33,437
Toast and cupcakes!
That sounds good, Chuck.

371
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:34,591
See you there.

372
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:36,400
Hold on. I said...

373
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:38,598
Hello? Hello?

374
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:42,751
Rats.

375
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:16,194
Hey! What's going on?

376
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:18,991
Turn it down!

377
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,595
Turn it down in there!

378
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:26,879
She likes to dance.

379
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:22,521
One, two, three, four.

380
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:29,714
One, two, three, four.

381
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:32,521
One, two, three, four.

382
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:38,918
I could really use
a dance partner.

383
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,396
Good luck with that.

384
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:42,359
One, two, three, four.

385
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:45,436
Okay, Snoopy,
I got the basics down.

386
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:48,241
But if I'm going to win,
I need to step it up.

387
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:53,273
One, two, three, four.

388
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:55,234
One, two, three, four.

389
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:57,074
I can see it now.

390
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:06,632
We have our winners!

391
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:08,155
Let us applaud them

392
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:12,280
as they begin the traditional
dance of the champions!

393
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:22,071
Snoopy!

394
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:24,635
Thanks for the help.

395
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,559
I left some cookies
in your dog dish.

396
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:30,156
One, two, three, four.

397
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,960
One, two, three...

398
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:45,120
You know, I've always wanted
to dance with Pigpen.

399
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:46,431
Yuck!

400
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:53,195
Why isn't anyone dancing?
It's called a dance.

401
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:56,791
Oh, Sweet Babboo!

402
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:57,871
Oh, no, here she comes!

403
00:32:57,950 --> 00:32:59,520
Someone needs to
get this dance started.

404
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:01,234
No!

405
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:22,631
These cupcakes
don't look half bad,

406
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:24,678
if I do say so myself.

407
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:27,834
This time
I've come totally prepared.

408
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:30,079
I couldn't have done it
without you.

409
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:32,717
The old Charlie Brown
would still be lying in bed

410
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:34,434
with a stomachache.

411
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,240
Good grief.

412
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:50,036
Marcie, look! Everyone's here!

413
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:53,716
Oh. Let me help you
with that, Marcie.

414
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:56,038
Such a gentleman, Charles.

415
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:00,280
She's here.

416
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:05,271
Okay, ladies.

417
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:07,558
It's time for you to show off
your best move.

418
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:09,753
Which one of you
will win the first half

419
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:11,201
of our dance competition...

420
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:13,079
and take home the trophy?

421
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:14,761
Let them hear it!

422
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:16,874
Nice moves.

423
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:20,239
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah!

424
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:24,160
Listen to that noise!

425
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:27,473
I think it's safe to say
we know who our winner is!

426
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:28,551
She won.

427
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:30,314
And now,
it's the gentlemen's turn...

428
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:32,916
to see who will be joining
our lovely winning lady...

429
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,754
for the final dance
of the night.

430
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:36,311
I got to get out there.

431
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:39,997
Are you guys ready?
Then here we go!

432
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:55,671
This is it.

433
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:58,635
It's now or never.

434
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:10,317
Whoa!

435
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:12,592
Check out the moves on that
funny-looking kid

436
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:14,434
with the big nose!

437
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:17,677
Yeah! All right!

438
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:31,636
Okay, just like you practiced.

439
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:32,711
Remember the steps.

440
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:36,795
One, two, three, four.

441
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:38,839
One, two, three...

442
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:47,992
Charlie Brown?
All right!

443
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:52,361
It looks like
we may have a winner here!

444
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:53,910
It's going to happen.

445
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:56,070
I'm about to dance with
the Little Red-Haired Girl.

446
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:00,991
Whoa!

447
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:06,512
Let's get out of here!

448
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:11,074
Do I know you?

449
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:15,512
Wait!
It's not over yet.

450
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:22,196
Thanks, buddy.

451
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:27,833
I hate to say it, Snoopy...

452
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:30,072
it seems like the harder I try,

453
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:32,192
the further away she gets.

454
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:48,557
The Flying Ace took to the skies.

455
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:52,914
He searched endlessly for the
girl who had stolen his heart.

456
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:35,831
Ha-ha!

457
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:09,561
Daydreaming will not make her
materialize, Charlie Brown.

458
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:11,951
She's not here.
Daydreaming? Me?

459
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,476
She'll be back on Monday.

460
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:15,200
I heard she went back east
to take care

461
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:16,994
of her grandmother,
who isn't feeling well.

462
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:18,680
She seems
like the kind of person

463
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:20,121
who would do that sort of thing.

464
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:24,271
Aww!
Not another book report!

465
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:25,876
Time to pick our partners.

466
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:28,671
No boys. No boys.

467
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:30,031
Please...

468
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:31,796
Patty! Yes!

469
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:33,156
All right!

470
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:35,873
Nope. Uh-uh.

471
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:38,031
Yes.

472
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:41,195
Schroeder!

473
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:45,196
There's no denying it.
It was written in the cards.

474
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:03,839
The Little Red-Haired Girl.
My lucky day!

475
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:07,512
This changes everything.
She will see the new me.

476
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:10,071
And together
we will win the gold star!

477
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:12,232
After that,
anything is possible!

478
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:14,552
We could be the first kids
to land on the moon!

479
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:16,559
One small step for kids...

480
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:19,037
one giant leap
for Charlie Brown.

481
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,160
You've got to help me, Linus.

482
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:26,153
I'm not sure I can handle
being partners

483
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:27,675
with the
Little Red-Haired Girl.

484
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:29,434
I need to slow things down.

485
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:32,161
Maybe I'm not ready
for a serious relationship.

486
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:33,761
How will I support her?

487
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:36,993
I can't afford a mortgage.
What if I'm put into escrow?

488
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:40,239
Charlie Brown,
you're being ridiculous.

489
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:41,835
You're the only person I know

490
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:43,435
who can turn
a simple book report...

491
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:45,274
into a lifelong commitment.

492
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:48,274
I've never been responsible
for anything before.

493
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:51,434
This could be the worst thing
that's ever happened to her!

494
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:57,113
Linus, it just hit me.

495
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:59,352
I think I know
how to become her hero.

496
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:01,797
While she's away taking care
of her grandmother...

497
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:04,920
I could complete the book
report for the two of us.

498
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:08,552
That's one way to go,
but if you want my advice...

499
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:13,555
They're posting
the test scores. Come on.

500
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:16,961
Look. Someone got
a perfect score, sir.

501
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:20,080
You would have to be a genius
to get a perfect score.

502
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:21,556
I didn't know
that was even possible.

503
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:22,950
It's him!
Here he comes!

504
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:25,312
No one in the world
has ever gotten 100 before.

505
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:33,801
A perfect score?

506
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:36,635
Me? This can't be right.

507
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:38,320
No, Charlie Brown, look.

508
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:40,159
You really do have
a perfect score.

509
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:43,430
I have heard peanut butter
is brain food.

510
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:44,995
Nice job, Chuck, old boy.

511
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:47,278
I always knew
you had it in you, Charles.

512
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:48,517
This can't be right!

513
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:50,235
Out of my way!

514
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:52,592
Mr. Perfect, Charlie Brown?

515
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:53,990
It must be a typo!

516
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:56,517
I don't believe it.
I won't believe it!

517
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:58,354
I demand a recount!

518
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:00,433
Good afternoon, students and staff.

519
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:01,716
We have a special announcement.

520
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:04,601
There will be an all-school
assembly Monday morning...

521
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:07,674
to celebrate our illustrious
classmate, Charlie Brown...

522
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:10,435
who achieved a perfect score
on the standardized test.

523
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:13,277
Make way.
Genius coming through!

524
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:15,074
I have a science project
due next week.

525
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:16,351
Can you give me your thoughts?

526
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:17,875
Hey, I saw him first!

527
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:20,999
They say you're a genius.
Can you read my mind?

528
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:22,231
Hey, leave him alone!

529
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:23,880
Yeah, leave him alone!

530
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:27,080
Now, Charlie Brown, as far
as the book report goes,

531
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:28,840
what would you suggest?

532
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:30,714
Well, you can never go wrong

533
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:31,990
if you stick with the classics.

534
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:33,316
A comic book?

535
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:35,398
I thought classics
had to have hard covers.

536
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:37,916
Boy, do we feel stupid now.

537
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:45,239
Will you look at this.
What a contemporary piece.

538
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:47,392
Notice his use of space.

539
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:50,077
Have you all lost your minds?

540
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:54,951
Wow.

541
00:42:57,790 --> 00:43:00,953
You have what is referred
to as an "irrational fear."

542
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:04,752
Hey, kid! What do you think
you're doing?

543
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:07,595
Following in the footsteps
of greatness.

544
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:08,870
Breakaway!

545
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:10,400
Shoot it, Charlie Brown!
Shoot it!

546
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:17,958
Nice use of angles there,
Charles.

547
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:19,914
All right, Charlie Brown!

548
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:24,438
But how is Santa ever going to
find our house without lights?

549
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:28,671
Yay!

550
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:31,638
And this is where it all began.

551
00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:33,474
As a youth, he passed many hours

552
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:34,830
just sitting in that chair...

553
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:37,112
keeping his deep thoughts
to himself.

554
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:39,113
And here we have
his early kites,

555
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:42,114
- used in many aerodynamic studies.
- Wow.

556
00:43:42,510 --> 00:43:45,434
If we're lucky, we'll see him
in his natural habitat.

557
00:43:46,110 --> 00:43:47,919
And this is his actual bed

558
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:50,641
where he lies and ponders
life's greatest questions.

559
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:52,519
Hey! What are you doing?

560
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:54,678
I'm cashing in
on your celebrity.

561
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:01,596
Can I have your autograph?

562
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:02,671
Nope.

563
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:05,200
And for show and tell today...

564
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:07,799
...my big brother!

565
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:24,475
Oh! I haven't seen you
in a while.

566
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:26,394
My whole life has changed,
Linus.

567
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:28,712
All of a sudden, everyone
wants to be my friend...

568
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:30,634
and yet,
I haven't really changed.

569
00:44:30,790 --> 00:44:33,680
Do they like me for who I am,
or for who they think I am?

570
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:36,117
There he is! Charlie Brown,
I need you on my chess team!

571
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:37,510
He's got no time

572
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:38,591
for meaningless games.
He's coming with me.

573
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:39,751
Roll sound!

574
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:41,560
- Speed.
- And, action!

575
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:44,152
Do you have time to help me
write my book report?

576
00:44:44,270 --> 00:44:45,271
It's due on Monday.

577
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:47,637
Monday?
The report is due on Monday?

578
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:50,794
She's back on Monday!
I haven't even started yet!

579
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:52,793
Does anyone know
where Marcie is?

580
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:55,112
She went skating
with Peppermint Patty.

581
00:44:55,390 --> 00:44:57,358
Mr. Brown. Mr. Brown!

582
00:44:57,510 --> 00:44:59,433
What about my exclusive?

583
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:01,031
Cut.

584
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:02,840
There's Huckleberry Finn...

585
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:05,041
Catcher in the Rye.

586
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:08,319
Sir, I've been sitting here
for hours.

587
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:11,201
These are the greatest books
of all time.

588
00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:12,601
Please just pick one!

589
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:14,354
Hmm.
Let me sleep on it, Marcie.

590
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:16,632
There's no time
for sleeping, sir.

591
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:17,711
It's due Monday.

592
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:24,074
Just my luck to get a partner
that thinks Moby Dick

593
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:25,720
was a hockey player.

594
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:28,441
Marcie? Where are you going?

595
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:31,915
Hey, Chuck, old boy.

596
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:34,354
What brings you down here?

597
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:36,080
I'm looking for Marcie.

598
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:40,111
I need some advice.

599
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:43,558
Curveball not working for you?
Slap shot not strong enough?

600
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:46,872
No, I'm good with all that.

601
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:48,475
I need to talk to Marcie about

602
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:50,757
finding the greatest book
of all time.

603
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:53,721
I just might be able
to help you there, Chuck.

604
00:45:53,870 --> 00:45:57,317
Marcie just read up
a long list of great novels.

605
00:45:57,510 --> 00:46:00,036
Huckleberry-something,
Catcher with a Pie.

606
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:04,195
But, she said the greatest
book of all time...

607
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:06,597
is called Leo's Toy Store...

608
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:11,039
by some old guy called
Warren... Piece.

609
00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:12,356
Leo's Toy Store.

610
00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:14,114
Yup. That's the one, Chuck.

611
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:15,431
Thanks for the tip.

612
00:46:15,590 --> 00:46:17,319
Love that hustle, Chuck!

613
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:24,994
Does anyone know where I can
find Leo's Toy Store?

614
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:47,031
Shh.

615
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:49,397
Leo's Toy Store.

616
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:50,517
Nope.

617
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:52,911
No. No.

618
00:46:52,990 --> 00:46:54,196
Huh?
No.

619
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:56,394
Hmm. Where is it?

620
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:02,080
He's going into
the grown-up's section.

621
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:03,356
Is that legal?

622
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:11,793
Charles? I've never seen
you in here before.

623
00:47:11,950 --> 00:47:14,521
Marcie, thank goodness
I found you.

624
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:17,077
Can you help me find
a copy of Leo's Toy Store?

625
00:47:17,230 --> 00:47:20,120
Did you say "Leo's Toy Store"?

626
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:21,635
Yeah. Peppermint Patty
told me

627
00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:22,916
you said it was the greatest...

628
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:26,119
Stop right there, Charles.
Come with me.

629
00:47:26,590 --> 00:47:28,752
This is what you're looking for.

630
00:47:29,310 --> 00:47:31,916
Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace.

631
00:47:32,270 --> 00:47:33,271
Oh.

632
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:39,750
Yikes. How long was this war?

633
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:42,436
Are you sure that is the book
you want to read?

634
00:47:42,590 --> 00:47:44,274
Might I remind you, Charles,

635
00:47:44,350 --> 00:47:46,398
you only have the weekend
to complete your report.

636
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:49,913
I have to if I'm going to win
that gold star.

637
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:55,275
I'm okay.

638
00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:06,751
Big book.

639
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:09,390
How are you gonna get it home,
smarty-pants?

640
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:20,316
Pretty smart.

641
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:21,517
What am I saying?

642
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:23,911
Good ol' Charlie Brown.

643
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:26,631
Now there's a guy
who's going places.

644
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:40,596
Thanks.

645
00:48:49,830 --> 00:48:51,036
Surprise!

646
00:48:51,590 --> 00:48:52,790
Happy Birthday!

647
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:54,036
Who invited him?

648
00:49:11,270 --> 00:49:13,591
War and Peace. Page one.

649
00:49:13,790 --> 00:49:17,511
"Eh bien, mon prince,
so Genoa...“

650
00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:23,236
Hey, Charlie Brown,
come out and play!

651
00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:27,430
- Sorry, guys.
- Aww!

652
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:29,041
Who reads a book on the weekend?

653
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:30,794
Not me.
Okay. Where was I?

654
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:32,554
"...took a horse
from a commander,

655
00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:33,711
"and hungry and weary..."

656
00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:36,715
"...and the musketry fire
sounded far away..."

657
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:45,040
"Prince Andrei mused on the
unimportance of greatness...

658
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:48,000
"unimportance of life, which
no one could understand..."

659
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:50,756
"...and there was yesterday,
and there was the day before..."

660
00:49:50,870 --> 00:49:52,201
Ooh!

661
00:49:54,990 --> 00:49:57,118
Okay, show's over.
Clear it out.

662
00:49:57,270 --> 00:49:58,431
Will there be a late show?

663
00:49:58,590 --> 00:50:01,719
"...and to recognize a
dependence we do not feel.

664
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:03,315
"The end."

665
00:50:04,550 --> 00:50:05,836
I did it.

666
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:20,392
It's all coming together now.

667
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:28,398
Okay. This is my book report
about War and Peace.

668
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:31,520
1,2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

669
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:34,394
First there was war.

670
00:50:34,550 --> 00:50:36,518
Then there was peace.

671
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:40,880
10,11,12,13,14,
15,16,17.

672
00:50:42,310 --> 00:50:45,996
Only 983 words to go.

673
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:53,631
Rats!

674
00:50:59,270 --> 00:51:00,874
This is no use.

675
00:51:01,030 --> 00:51:03,192
I'm just not as smart
as they think I am.

676
00:51:10,950 --> 00:51:12,634
I can't let her down.

677
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:16,076
There's still time.
You can do this.

678
00:51:17,350 --> 00:51:19,000
You can't give up on her now.

679
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:29,039
998, 999...

680
00:51:29,350 --> 00:51:32,035
1000. Finished.

681
00:51:41,070 --> 00:51:42,799
Wake up, big brother!

682
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:44,475
Today's the big assembly

683
00:51:44,590 --> 00:51:46,194
to celebrate your perfect score.

684
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:47,351
Come see!

685
00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:50,515
What are you up to now?

686
00:51:50,670 --> 00:51:52,399
Now that you're a big celebrity,

687
00:51:52,470 --> 00:51:53,995
we have to move fast.

688
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:57,597
I have shirts, hats,
mugs, and more.

689
00:51:57,750 --> 00:52:00,799
The fame that comes
with intellectual superiority

690
00:52:00,870 --> 00:52:02,031
can be very fleeting.

691
00:52:02,430 --> 00:52:04,432
You have to cash in
while you can.

692
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:09,640
Today is going to be
a big day for us, big brother.

693
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:16,792
Thank you. Come again soon.

694
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:19,956
This is all for you,
Charlie Brown.

695
00:52:20,030 --> 00:52:21,395
You've really made it.

696
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:23,155
It's going to happen.

697
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:25,114
She's finally going to notice me

698
00:52:25,230 --> 00:52:26,994
for doing something great.

699
00:52:27,830 --> 00:52:28,831
Charlie Brown.

700
00:52:29,670 --> 00:52:32,150
I hate to admit it,
you blockhead...

701
00:52:32,310 --> 00:52:35,075
but public opinion
leads me to believe,

702
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:37,232
that after all these years...

703
00:52:37,390 --> 00:52:39,870
I may have been wrong about you.

704
00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:41,475
This is not easy for me!

705
00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:44,315
My whole world has turned
upside-down!

706
00:52:48,510 --> 00:52:52,037
Can I please have Charlie
Brown come to the stage?

707
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:02,990
It is my pleasure
to present to you today...

708
00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:05,152
this award for the
highest achievement

709
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:06,999
in this year's
standardized testing.

710
00:53:07,190 --> 00:53:09,875
But before I do,
the school proclamation.

711
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:14,240
"On this day,
whereas you have upheld

712
00:53:14,350 --> 00:53:16,273
"the highest
of academic standards.

713
00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:20,754
"And whereas no one would have
ever expected that of you.

714
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:23,112
"And whereas you are the first

715
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:25,079
"to ever receive
a perfect score.

716
00:53:25,550 --> 00:53:26,836
"Therefore, be it resolved

717
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:30,119
"that today is declared
Charlie Brown Day.

718
00:53:30,270 --> 00:53:32,238
"Signed, Miss Othmar."

719
00:53:43,630 --> 00:53:45,473
That's my big brother!

720
00:53:48,950 --> 00:53:50,793
How about that, Charlie Brown?

721
00:53:50,870 --> 00:53:52,952
You're the star
of the school now!

722
00:53:53,150 --> 00:53:54,720
Congratulations, Charles.

723
00:53:54,910 --> 00:53:57,800
Let me present you
with your perfect test.

724
00:54:02,110 --> 00:54:05,114
Oh, no. I must
have signed the wrong paper.

725
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:27,275
Before I begin,

726
00:54:27,350 --> 00:54:30,479
I'd like to thank
all of you for your support.

727
00:54:32,950 --> 00:54:34,679
You have all been so kind.

728
00:54:34,830 --> 00:54:38,312
It's not often that I get
this sort of recognition.

729
00:54:38,830 --> 00:54:40,434
But, um...

730
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:43,274
there's been a mistake.

731
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:49,351
This is not my test.

732
00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:52,671
Ha! I knew it!

733
00:54:54,270 --> 00:54:58,719
Therefore,
I cannot accept this honor.

734
00:54:59,270 --> 00:55:01,796
Can a brother and sister
get a divorce?

735
00:55:02,150 --> 00:55:04,721
I think this belongs to
Peppermint Patty.

736
00:55:04,790 --> 00:55:06,474
She's the real genius.

737
00:55:25,670 --> 00:55:28,071
That was a very
admirable thing you just did,

738
00:55:28,150 --> 00:55:29,436
Charlie Brown.

739
00:55:30,350 --> 00:55:33,479
One moment I'm the hero,
the next I'm the goat.

740
00:55:33,910 --> 00:55:35,514
Maybe things will go
your way again

741
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:37,718
after you hand in
your book report.

742
00:55:38,550 --> 00:55:40,314
I'm not so sure.

743
00:55:40,990 --> 00:55:42,321
I was up all night working on it

744
00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:44,313
and I can't remember
a single word.

745
00:55:44,510 --> 00:55:47,354
Surely it's not as bad
as you think, Charlie Brown.

746
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:49,353
Let me see what you wrote.

747
00:55:52,830 --> 00:55:54,878
Charlie Brown,
the insight you bring

748
00:55:54,990 --> 00:55:57,755
to such a complex novel
is beyond reproach.

749
00:55:57,910 --> 00:55:59,674
You two are sure to win
the gold star

750
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:01,912
with a book report
of this quality.

751
00:56:02,110 --> 00:56:03,510
Book report?

752
00:56:03,830 --> 00:56:05,958
Were we supposed to do
a book report?

753
00:56:06,510 --> 00:56:09,116
Oh! Hi. In light of the fact
that you were away...

754
00:56:09,270 --> 00:56:11,113
Charlie Brown took it
upon himself

755
00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:13,079
to complete the report
for the both of you.

756
00:56:13,230 --> 00:56:15,437
And I must say, this is
one of the finest bits...

757
00:56:15,590 --> 00:56:17,638
of literary analysis
I have ever read.

758
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:30,031
Aaugh!

759
00:56:33,070 --> 00:56:35,038
No, no, no!

760
00:56:39,870 --> 00:56:42,237
Oh, good grief.

761
00:56:44,310 --> 00:56:46,074
Maybe we can fix it?

762
00:56:54,550 --> 00:56:57,554
Chapter 4.
Curse you, Red Baron!

763
01:00:06,430 --> 01:00:08,876
The Flying Ace set out
across the hostile

764
01:00:08,950 --> 01:00:11,601
countryside undeterred.

765
01:00:44,230 --> 01:00:46,198
Whenever I feel really alone,

766
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:49,154
I just sit and stare
into the night sky.

767
01:00:49,470 --> 01:00:52,679
I've always thought that one
of those stars was my star...

768
01:00:52,870 --> 01:00:54,759
and at moments like this,

769
01:00:54,830 --> 01:00:57,800
I know that my star
will always be there for me.

770
01:00:57,990 --> 01:01:02,154
Like a comforting voice
saying, "Don't give up, kid."

771
01:01:06,870 --> 01:01:09,919
The Flying Ace had
to return to the aerodrome...

772
01:01:10,070 --> 01:01:12,152
if he was ever to rescue Fifi.

773
01:01:35,670 --> 01:01:36,751
Hey.

774
01:02:16,910 --> 01:02:17,991
Shh.

775
01:02:19,590 --> 01:02:20,637
Wait for my cue.

776
01:02:20,710 --> 01:02:22,474
Timing is crucial
if we're going to succeed.

777
01:02:22,550 --> 01:02:23,631
They'll never expect us.

778
01:02:23,710 --> 01:02:25,439
Eyes on me
and wait for my signal.

779
01:02:25,830 --> 01:02:29,471
Christmas time is here

780
01:02:30,390 --> 01:02:34,236
Happiness and cheer

781
01:02:40,750 --> 01:02:44,914
Yeah, Chuck, your crazy dog
is over here again.

782
01:03:21,710 --> 01:03:22,711
Aww!

783
01:03:23,030 --> 01:03:27,001
Excuse me, mister.
Have you ever flown a kite?

784
01:03:28,350 --> 01:03:32,196
Well, actually,
let me just say that...

785
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:34,956
I have years of experience
with kites, but I...

786
01:03:35,150 --> 01:03:36,390
That's great!

787
01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:39,156
Oh! Well, okay.

788
01:03:39,310 --> 01:03:42,473
The thing is, flying a kite
isn't for everyone.

789
01:03:42,630 --> 01:03:44,632
It takes a certain
type of person.

790
01:03:44,790 --> 01:03:46,679
It can frustrating at times.

791
01:03:46,830 --> 01:03:48,320
They tend to have
a mind of their own.

792
01:03:48,470 --> 01:03:50,950
But with determination
and dedication,

793
01:03:51,030 --> 01:03:52,156
you can make it happen.

794
01:03:52,270 --> 01:03:53,271
Really?

795
01:03:53,350 --> 01:03:56,160
Here. You hold the string.
Plant your feet.

796
01:03:56,310 --> 01:03:58,358
Weight forward. Knees bent.

797
01:03:58,550 --> 01:04:00,678
Back straight. Head up.

798
01:04:00,830 --> 01:04:02,912
And remember, keep it simple.

799
01:04:03,830 --> 01:04:04,911
Okay.

800
01:04:05,070 --> 01:04:07,516
When I say "go,"
run as fast as you can.

801
01:04:07,670 --> 01:04:09,195
Which way, mister?

802
01:04:13,670 --> 01:04:15,513
That way. Now, go!

803
01:04:19,830 --> 01:04:21,116
I hope the little guy

804
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:22,601
doesn't get discouraged, Snoopy.

805
01:04:22,870 --> 01:04:25,191
He doesn't quite know
how difficult this will be.

806
01:04:25,390 --> 01:04:26,551
It may take him years

807
01:04:26,670 --> 01:04:28,274
to gain my level of experience.

808
01:04:28,430 --> 01:04:29,630
It doesn't just
happen over-...

809
01:04:31,030 --> 01:04:33,397
Woo-hoo! It's flying!

810
01:04:33,790 --> 01:04:35,076
Wow!

811
01:04:35,430 --> 01:04:38,434
Thanks, mister.
You sure know your kites.

812
01:04:39,030 --> 01:04:40,714
Do you want to try?

813
01:04:48,070 --> 01:04:49,230
You can do it!

814
01:04:49,590 --> 01:04:51,240
Don't give up!

815
01:04:52,310 --> 01:04:53,311
A-ha!

816
01:04:53,870 --> 01:04:56,919
Chapter 7.
Never give up!

817
01:04:58,950 --> 01:05:01,271
The Flying Ace knew
this would be

818
01:05:01,390 --> 01:05:04,121
the last chance
to save the love of his life.

819
01:08:32,630 --> 01:08:35,315
The Flying Ace returned
to the aerodrome

820
01:08:35,430 --> 01:08:36,670
with the love of his life.

821
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:38,832
He returned a hero.

822
01:08:45,990 --> 01:08:48,311
"And so, as our hero observed...

823
01:08:48,470 --> 01:08:49,801
"he was destined to face

824
01:08:49,870 --> 01:08:52,441
"the infamous Red Baron
another day."

825
01:08:52,630 --> 01:08:54,120
A dog that flies?

826
01:08:54,270 --> 01:08:56,796
This is the dumbest thing
I have ever read!

827
01:09:05,830 --> 01:09:08,356
Ugh! I got dog germs!

828
01:09:14,190 --> 01:09:15,999
Come on, Charlie Brown!

829
01:09:16,990 --> 01:09:19,561
Today calls for
something special. Here we go.

830
01:09:21,870 --> 01:09:22,871
Hey, guys.

831
01:09:22,990 --> 01:09:24,754
It's the last day of school!

832
01:09:25,070 --> 01:09:27,391
Well, big brother,
can you believe it?

833
01:09:27,550 --> 01:09:30,281
No more reading,
writing, arithmetic.

834
01:09:30,350 --> 01:09:32,193
No more learning ever!

835
01:09:32,350 --> 01:09:33,681
What are you talking about?

836
01:09:33,750 --> 01:09:35,514
This is just the start
of summer vacation.

837
01:09:35,670 --> 01:09:37,672
You have eight more years
of grammar school.

838
01:09:37,830 --> 01:09:39,161
Four more years of high school.

839
01:09:39,230 --> 01:09:41,358
Eight...
Plus four more years of college.

840
01:09:41,430 --> 01:09:44,354
Plus four. Add the one
to an extra four...

841
01:09:44,750 --> 01:09:48,357
That's over 37 years of school!

842
01:09:48,510 --> 01:09:51,559
I'll be bald
and wrinkly by then.

843
01:09:55,510 --> 01:09:56,841
Wow.
Look at that!

844
01:09:57,430 --> 01:09:58,591
Is that Snoopy?

845
01:10:02,390 --> 01:10:03,391
Lucky.

846
01:10:08,350 --> 01:10:10,318
Okay, everyone, listen up.

847
01:10:10,390 --> 01:10:12,279
I know this is
the last day of school...

848
01:10:12,390 --> 01:10:13,391
Yay!

849
01:10:14,190 --> 01:10:16,192
But first, before we leave...

850
01:10:16,350 --> 01:10:18,114
we need to finish picking
our partners

851
01:10:18,190 --> 01:10:20,079
for this year's
summer pen-pal project.

852
01:10:20,390 --> 01:10:22,199
When I draw a name,

853
01:10:22,270 --> 01:10:24,034
stand if you want to be
their partner.

854
01:10:25,710 --> 01:10:28,793
Here we go.
The next name is... Pigpen!

855
01:10:28,950 --> 01:10:32,636
I will. A little dirt
never hurt anyone.

856
01:10:32,910 --> 01:10:33,911
Schroeder.

857
01:10:34,110 --> 01:10:35,475
I do!

858
01:10:35,950 --> 01:10:37,873
I mean, I will.

859
01:10:40,230 --> 01:10:41,391
Charlie Brown.

860
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:46,240
I will.

861
01:10:48,390 --> 01:10:50,190
She will?

862
01:10:56,110 --> 01:10:57,760
Summertime!

863
01:11:01,510 --> 01:11:02,511
Hi!

864
01:11:05,590 --> 01:11:07,319
Charlie Brown,
where have you been?

865
01:11:07,470 --> 01:11:09,598
It's the first day of summer.

866
01:11:09,750 --> 01:11:12,276
You should be down there
having fun with everyone else.

867
01:11:12,430 --> 01:11:14,910
I can't stop
thinking about it, Linus.

868
01:11:15,110 --> 01:11:16,919
After all the
humiliating disasters

869
01:11:16,990 --> 01:11:18,594
she witnessed this year...

870
01:11:18,750 --> 01:11:20,320
why would she choose me?

871
01:11:20,470 --> 01:11:22,199
Was she feeling sorry for me?

872
01:11:22,350 --> 01:11:23,715
I don't want her to choose me

873
01:11:23,790 --> 01:11:25,838
just because she was feeling
sorry for me.

874
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:28,516
I have slightly more dignity
than that.

875
01:11:28,670 --> 01:11:29,956
Charlie Brown...

876
01:11:30,110 --> 01:11:33,159
it might be time to consider
the wild possibility...

877
01:11:33,310 --> 01:11:36,439
that you're a good person
and that people like you.

878
01:11:37,150 --> 01:11:38,561
But, you know, you'll never

879
01:11:38,630 --> 01:11:39,995
really know the answer,
unless...

880
01:11:40,150 --> 01:11:41,720
I just go up and talk to her!

881
01:11:41,870 --> 01:11:44,476
I should've listened to you
all along!

882
01:12:06,630 --> 01:12:09,634
Oh! "Charles."
I mean, "Charlie Brown."

883
01:12:10,550 --> 01:12:11,551
She's not here?

884
01:12:12,390 --> 01:12:14,154
On her way to summer camp?

885
01:12:14,470 --> 01:12:16,040
So the bus
hasn't left school yet?

886
01:12:16,710 --> 01:12:18,280
But it's about to leave?

887
01:12:21,230 --> 01:12:23,836
And, by the way,
it was a pleasure to meet you, ma'am.

888
01:12:25,990 --> 01:12:27,230
Charlie Brown!

889
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:29,841
You blockhead!

890
01:12:32,150 --> 01:12:33,720
Whoo! All right!

891
01:12:49,670 --> 01:12:50,671
Aaugh!

892
01:12:55,510 --> 01:12:56,511
Yay!

893
01:13:19,550 --> 01:13:21,314
How do I get out of here?

894
01:13:31,390 --> 01:13:34,394
The whole world seems to be
conspiring against me.

895
01:13:36,390 --> 01:13:40,315
I'm just asking for a little
help for once in my life.

896
01:13:49,630 --> 01:13:50,916
Get out of here!

897
01:13:51,230 --> 01:13:52,231
Not you, too!

898
01:13:56,070 --> 01:13:57,993
Hey look, it's Charlie Brown!

899
01:14:04,150 --> 01:14:06,312
Charlie Brown is flying a kite?

900
01:14:06,790 --> 01:14:09,634
Charlie Brown is flying a kite!

901
01:14:12,310 --> 01:14:14,438
Wow! Chuck's got a kite
in the air.

902
01:14:14,510 --> 01:14:15,875
Way to go, Charles!
Whoa!

903
01:14:18,950 --> 01:14:20,634
Charlie Brown
is really doing it!

904
01:14:20,710 --> 01:14:21,836
He's flying a kite!

905
01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:37,551
Whoa!

906
01:14:44,350 --> 01:14:46,478
Oh, hi, Charlie Brown.

907
01:14:47,390 --> 01:14:48,994
You remembered my name?

908
01:14:49,310 --> 01:14:50,914
Of course I did.

909
01:14:51,670 --> 01:14:53,399
Before you leave,

910
01:14:53,470 --> 01:14:55,632
there's something
I really need to know.

911
01:14:55,830 --> 01:14:59,835
Why, out of all the kids
in our class,

912
01:14:59,910 --> 01:15:02,151
would you want to be
partners with me?

913
01:15:03,150 --> 01:15:04,595
That's easy.

914
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:07,754
Because I've seen
the type of person you are.

915
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:11,560
An insecure,
wishy-washy failure?

916
01:15:12,990 --> 01:15:15,152
That's not who you are at all.

917
01:15:15,670 --> 01:15:17,195
I like the compassion you showed

918
01:15:17,350 --> 01:15:18,840
for your sister
at the talent show.

919
01:15:19,430 --> 01:15:21,512
The honesty you had
at the assembly.

920
01:15:21,990 --> 01:15:25,836
And at the dance,
you were brave, and funny.

921
01:15:26,070 --> 01:15:27,231
Aww.

922
01:15:27,670 --> 01:15:29,399
And what you did for me...

923
01:15:29,550 --> 01:15:33,396
doing the book report while I
was away, was so sweet of you.

924
01:15:36,230 --> 01:15:39,200
So when I look at you,
I don't see a failure at all.

925
01:15:39,670 --> 01:15:42,719
You have all the qualities
that I admire.

926
01:15:43,870 --> 01:15:46,237
Sorry, I have to go now.

927
01:15:48,270 --> 01:15:49,601
Wait.

928
01:15:50,350 --> 01:15:52,796
I think this belongs to you.

929
01:15:53,230 --> 01:15:57,201
Thank you. I've been looking
everywhere for this!

930
01:16:00,550 --> 01:16:02,712
I'll write to you, pen-pal.

931
01:16:04,870 --> 01:16:05,871
Bye!

932
01:16:17,550 --> 01:16:18,836
Is he okay?

933
01:16:26,790 --> 01:16:28,679
It must feel pretty great being

934
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:30,593
Charlie Brown right about now.

935
01:16:31,230 --> 01:16:32,231
You did it.

936
01:16:34,150 --> 01:16:35,595
Nice job, Chuck.

937
01:16:35,670 --> 01:16:37,081
Good job, Charles!

938
01:16:37,150 --> 01:16:38,515
Hey, big brother!

939
01:16:42,070 --> 01:16:44,755
I'm proud
to be your little sister.

940
01:16:45,990 --> 01:16:47,321
Out of my way!

941
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:50,199
I really need to
tell you something,

942
01:16:50,270 --> 01:16:51,601
you blockhead.

943
01:16:51,750 --> 01:16:54,151
You're still full of surprises.

944
01:16:54,310 --> 01:16:56,597
Good ol' Charlie Brown!

945
01:18:01,150 --> 01:18:02,675
Charlie Brown.

946
01:18:02,830 --> 01:18:04,753
Oh, Charlie Brown.

947
01:18:04,910 --> 01:18:07,072
I'll hold the football
and you kick it.

948
01:18:07,150 --> 01:18:09,596
You say you'll hold it,
but what you really mean is...

949
01:18:09,670 --> 01:18:11,559
you'll pull it away,
and I'll land on my back

950
01:18:11,630 --> 01:18:12,791
and I'll kill myself.

951
01:18:12,950 --> 01:18:15,191
But I feel I have really
come to know you.

952
01:18:15,350 --> 01:18:17,671
I now understand
that you are kind,

953
01:18:17,750 --> 01:18:20,230
compassionate, brave, and funny.

954
01:18:20,390 --> 01:18:22,233
No one would pull
a football away

955
01:18:22,310 --> 01:18:24,551
from a person
with all those qualities.

956
01:18:24,910 --> 01:18:25,957
She's right.

957
01:18:26,030 --> 01:18:27,395
I would never pull the ball away

958
01:18:27,470 --> 01:18:29,711
from someone
with all those qualities.

959
01:18:29,870 --> 01:18:32,680
I'm gonna kick this ball
all the way to the moon.

960
01:18:39,470 --> 01:18:42,314
And gullible. I forgot
to mention "gullible."

961
01:19:34,910 --> 01:19:39,120
A round of root beers for
our hero, the Flying Ace!
