9
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,792
It's a beautiful day out here on the ice
as father meets daughter

10
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,651
in a quest for hockey supremacy.

11
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,114
It's Peaches meets Manny.

12
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,429
Mammoth meets mammoth.

13
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,675
Mano a mano.

14
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,760
Meema me moo-ma.

15
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,835
Mama may mee-mee.

16
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,413
Will you two quit it?

17
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,920
Mokay.

18
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,035
Meanie.

19
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,076
The blazing mammoth
takes it on the breakaway.

20
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,953
There's never been a player
so tough, so graceful.

21
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,758
So desperate to score.

22
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,115
He fakes right.
He fakes left.

23
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,191
He fakes knowing how to play.

24
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,120
What's wrong?

25
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,838
Lose something?

26
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,508
Hey, what's that stink
I smell out there? It's Manny!

27
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,591
Hey, hey. It's Manny!

28
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,795
You stink!

29
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,599
Okay, Fuzzball.
Let's see what you got.

30
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,279
You asked for it.

31
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,872
Yes! She dominates! Again.

32
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,031
Oh, please.
I went easy on you.

33
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,553
It's called good parenting.

34
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,029
Yeah, right. Face it.

35
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,553
I rule the ice now.

36
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,870
You talk a big game, hotshot.

37
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,632
All right, how about best of three?

38
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,289
Yes!
Touchdown!

39
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,158
Wait, no, that's not right.
Not touchdown. What is it?

40
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,629
Hole-in-one!

41
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:39,620
Julian!

42
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,490
Sorry.
Honey, I scored!

43
00:06:41,515 --> 00:06:42,662
Did you see me?

44
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,456
Yeah! And you were amazing.

45
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,640
Careful!

46
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,909
The ice is really icy.

47
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,072
It's like super-sized, extra value icy.

48
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,831
But I'm getting better, right?

49
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,990
Ok, we'll play...

50
00:07:01,515 --> 00:07:02,539
later.

51
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,635
So, she whupped your butt again?

52
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,156
And with a butt that size,

53
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,918
that's a whole lot of whupping.

54
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,548
Nobody was whupped.
There was no whupping.

55
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,948
It's just a loving father

56
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,076
sharing some strategy
with his only daughter.

57
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,708
Didn't know sucking was a strategy.

58
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,779
Ok, it's our turn.

59
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,658
Let's show them how it's done!

60
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,913
You're going down?

61
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,775
For you, my mom-in-law-to-be.

62
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,040
Buttercups!

63
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,713
Nature's sunshine.

64
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,314
Isn't sunshine nature's sunshine?

65
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,755
Thank you, Julian.

66
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,758
It's been so long since
anyone's given me flowers.

67
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,797
But you're marrying our daughter.

68
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,957
You don't have to keep bringing us presents.

69
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,399
But it makes me happy.

70
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,872
And for you, my guru,
my rock, my main mammoth.

71
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,112
To you, I give the greatest gift of all.

72
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,330
Wait. What are you doing?

73
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,239
Come on, Bro-Dad.
Bring it in.

74
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,397
I can feel your heart beating.

75
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,074
Ok. That's enough of that.

76
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,039
You better get used to it.

77
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,553
They'll be living right next door.

78
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,273
Come on, Julian.
Wanna go?

79
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:20,174
Actually, weren't you gonna
help me with the thing?

80
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,708
Right. The thing.

81
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,149
Gotta do the thing.

82
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,594
I can do the thing.

83
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,760
No!

84
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,431
It's a girl thing.

85
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,679
Hey! Why don't you go do a guy thing?

86
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,875
You know, you don't spend

87
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,176
nearly enough time with your friends.

88
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,170
I don't?
I'll see you later.

89
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,391
On this special day.

90
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,413
Ok.

91
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,699
Have you told them about
our decision yet?

92
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,089
No. I'm waiting for the right time.

93
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,276
Come on, Romeo.
Walk with me.

94
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,640
I'm gonna watch some butterflies
come out of their cocoons.

95
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,492
Really?
No.

96
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,319
Goodbye, sweetie.

97
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,072
I remember when Manny
and I used to be like that.

98
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,673
Not me! Love them and leave them,
and take half of everything.

99
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,114
That's my motto.

100
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,564
Mi amor,

101
00:09:09,789 --> 00:09:15,590
so many ladies have tried and failed,
to strap a saddle on Sid the stallion.

102
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,994
But I want to share everything with you.

103
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,430
You're the wind beneath my fleas,

104
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,999
the algae of my eye.

105
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,996
Will you be my mate for life?

106
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,419
Sidney?

107
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,159
Sidney, where are you?

108
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,400
Francine.

109
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,480
I need to ask...

110
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,917
I need to ask you something.

111
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,040
Will you marry...

112
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,560
Sid, I'm gonna stop you right there.

113
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,914
I'm breaking up with you.

114
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,389
What? But I planned our whole future!

115
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,073
Our wedding.

116
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,280
Our kids.

117
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,376
Mommy.

118
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,594
Our burial plots.

119
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,680
How you doing?

120
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,199
I even hired a band.

121
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,113
No, no. Not yet!

122
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,195
Are you crazy?
We've only had one date.

123
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,759
It lasted 14 minutes!

124
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,428
Yes, but it felt like 20.

125
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,039
I can't! A ring?

126
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,360
I mean, I like the ring, but no.

127
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,879
I can't. You're too clingy.

128
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,508
How is this clingy?

129
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,828
And by the way,

130
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,115
you look nothing like your profile picture.

131
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,109
Francine, you gotta start dating
outside of your species.

132
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,009
Franny, we can work this out.

133
00:10:27,334 --> 00:10:28,602
Is this about the bikini?

134
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,871
I didn't know it was poison ivy.

135
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,748
Franny. Franny, help!

136
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,319
Somebody.

137
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,391
Is it the eyes that hurt,

138
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,879
or my soul?

139
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,231
Definitely the eyes.

140
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,754
Women!

141
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,239
Yeah, women.

142
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
What about them?

143
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,252
I don't get them.

144
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,473
Like, Ellie.

145
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:06,219
Life's great with her.

146
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,999
There's no surprises.
Nothing ever changes.

147
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,674
But then today, she giggled.

148
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,432
Does Shira ever just giggle?

149
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,032
Please don't eat me!

150
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,656
Shira's not a big giggler.

151
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,178
Well, Ellie giggled.

152
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,599
And then she wiggled.

153
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,159
Don't ever do that again.

154
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,470
I have no idea why she's acting so weird.

155
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,039
Women.

156
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,136
Women.

157
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,459
Women.

158
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,160
Hello?

159
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,511
And speaking of weird.

160
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,177
Anybody there?

161
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,030
Marco? Polo?

162
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,420
Hi, Manny.

163
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,633
Your breath is awful.

164
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,800
What happened to you?

165
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,552
Oh, nothing.
Everything's great.

166
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,029
Fabulous. Zippity-dippity.

167
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,714
Ok, let me guess.
She dumped you.

168
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,950
What is wrong with me?

169
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,676
Everybody has somebody.

170
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,479
And all I've got is my boyish good looks

171
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,312
and this mariachi band.

172
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,393
So itchy!

173
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,597
Come on.
Let's get you cleaned up.

174
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,828
All I wanted is true love.

175
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,468
Is that too much to ask?

176
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,548
Why is it so quiet?

177
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,480
Because the world is mourning my loss.

178
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,508
Ellie?

179
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,309
Peaches?

180
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,153
Where is everyone?

181
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,420
Surprise!

182
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,672
Happy Anniversary, honey!

183
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,989
Anniversary?

184
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,159
Oh, no. That's the thing.

185
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,514
Ok! Now it's your turn, Bro-Dad!

186
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,398
Yeah! We wanna see what you got Ellie.

187
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,675
Manny!

188
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,991
Manny! Manny! Manny!

189
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,832
Manny!

190
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,834
Hey, hey. Right.
Manny! Manny! Manny!

191
00:15:37,058 --> 00:15:38,058
So...

192
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,918
How about another hand for Ellie?

193
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,235
Yeah.

194
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,394
He forgot!

195
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,112
I feel so bad for Ellie.

196
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,351
Ellie, I...

197
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,438
He didn't forget.

198
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,955
That's how big Manny's love is for her!

199
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,255
Nice save with the light show.

200
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,912
Wait, you didn't do this?
Then who did?

201
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,633
Oh, Manny.

202
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,870
I was so afraid you'd forgotten.

203
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,389
But you lit up the sky for me?

204
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,913
How'd you do it?

205
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,280
Well...

206
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,113
A magician never reveals his secrets.

207
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,273
Thank you.

208
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,796
I keep picturing our own kid in there.

209
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,439
He'd be the best one.

210
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,055
I think you meant she.

211
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,340
He.

212
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,759
Either way, we've been over this, Diego.

213
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,188
Kids are afraid of us.

214
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,793
Yeah, but why?

215
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,051
Are they gonna eat us?

216
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,520
Hi, kids!

217
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,970
I even smiled this time.

218
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,898
Ok Dad.
Best present ever.

219
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,430
You, sir, are an education
in marital excellence.

220
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,974
I'm really gonna miss
you guys when we leave.

221
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,732
Actually, I haven't told them yet.

222
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,959
Surprise!

223
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,220
You're leaving?

224
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,720
I thought you guys were gonna live with us
the first couple of years.

225
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,836
I know. But Julian and I

226
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,573
kind of want to roam for a while.

227
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,809
Roam?
Yeah!

228
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:42,772
Travel, explore, just go wherever.

229
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,381
No plan is the best plan.

230
00:17:44,706 --> 00:17:46,122
That's my philosophy.

231
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,480
Hors d'oeuvres?

232
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,948
That's not a plan, or a philosophy,
or very safe.

233
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,873
Dad, we're young.

234
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,674
We can worry about being safe
when we're old and boring.

235
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:56,940
Like you and Mom.

236
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,717
I think we should just...
Excuse me!

237
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,359
This is a family discussion.

238
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,431
But aren't I part of your family?

239
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,273
Not yet, you're not.

240
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,470
Does that look like a problem to you?

241
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,715
A ball of fire heading directly towards us?

242
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,199
Why would that be a problem?

243
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,976
What if you fall in a ditch and get amnesia?

244
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,094
What then?

245
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,395
Manny, we have a problem.

246
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,118
Not now.
I have a problem.

247
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,360
This one's a little bigger.

248
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,953
I don't think so.
Manny!

249
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,169
What?

250
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,400
Manny?

251
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,154
Ok. Party's over, everybody.

252
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,390
Have a good night.
And leave right now!

253
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,790
What are you talking about?
The party just got started.

254
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,960
Yeah.

255
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,630
Just getting kind of sleepy.

256
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,612
Everyone should go.
And duck. Possibly cover!

257
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,531
Hey, what's gotten into you?

258
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,193
Look! There's more coming!

259
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,472
Meteor shower!

260
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,434
Meteor?

261
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,560
Shower?

262
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,435
Manny's love is killing us!

263
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,398
I suppose this is all part
of your magic show for me?

264
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,598
Abracadabra?

265
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,073
Can you guys deal with this later?

266
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:20,728
Come on.
We need to take cover.

267
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,255
I'm on fire!

268
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,127
Me too!

269
00:19:29,152 --> 00:19:31,013
We're smoking hot, baby!

270
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,514
Incoming!

271
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,054
Those are ours!

272
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,219
Are you okay?
How many tusks do you see?

273
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,220
Tree.

274
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,200
Three?

275
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,851
No! Tree!

276
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,997
Everybody, jump!

277
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,682
The cave!

278
00:20:05,007 --> 00:20:06,055
Get inside!

279
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,274
Move! Move!

280
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,711
It's okay, sweetheart.
Daddy's...

281
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,592
It sounds like it's slowing down.

282
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,190
Yup, it's definitely over.

283
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,336
Except for that one.

284
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,034
We might wanna think

285
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,195
about moving underground for a while.

286
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,991
Look at that!
I got an egg.

287
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,880
How many eggs did you poach,
little brother?

288
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,656
Do we have to steal other creatures' eggs?

289
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,238
I mean, couldn't we just go vegan?

290
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,958
Sure, we could eat vegans.

291
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,071
Son, sometimes I wonder

292
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,991
how you snuck into this family.

293
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:31,149
<i>Figaro, Figaro,
Figaro, Figaro, Figaro!</i>

294
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,600
With you in a minute.

295
00:21:32,725 --> 00:21:34,675
I'll have to rinse and repeat.

296
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:37,474
That weasel is such a buzzkill.

297
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,833
Let's go, kids.

298
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,228
Don't worry, ma'am.

299
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,078
I'll catch the crew that poached your egg.

300
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,098
It's a pun!
I'm winking under the eye patch.

Go! I'll lead them away.

336
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,273
That was fun!

337
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,230
Same time, same place, next week?

338
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,670
Toodles!

339
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,469
Congratulations, weasel.

340
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,278
You just signed your death warrant.

341
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,235
Weaseled my way out of that one.

342
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,713
What's all that flash and dazzle about?

343
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,388
Who puts a rock in the middle of the jungle?

344
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,673
Blimey!

345
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,192
What is this place?

346
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,868
Hello?

347
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,879
Yeah!

348
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,137
Hello, mammals.

349
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,320
Hi, Buck!

350
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,140
Hi.

351
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,480
Bye, Buck!

352
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,929
A little help.

353
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,331
Right on the spleen!

354
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,795
Utterly useless, but totally hurts.

355
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:24,494
Hey, Buck.
Welcome back, buddy.

356
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:27,493
Wait. This half-a-snack
is the dinosaur whisperer?

357
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,935
And expert salsa dancer.

358
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,236
I have one eye but all my original teeth.

359
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,540
Would you like to count them?

360
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,699
No, thank you.

361
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,812
And this must be Nectarine.

362
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,779
Peaches.
Semantics, my dear.

363
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,999
I am deeply honored.

364
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,557
Sweet eye patch.
Very gangsta.

365
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,755
Thank you.

366
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,916
I like this kid.
Buck.

367
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,278
What are you doing here?

368
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,739
Well, I... What?

369
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,475
I'm trying!

370
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,969
But how do you tell
someone they're doomed?

371
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,977
He's stumped.

372
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,959
We're not doomed, Buck.

373
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,620
It was just a meteor shower,
and the show's over.

374
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,960
Oh, quite the contrary, old chap.

375
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,190
It's just beginning.

376
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,692
You see, I found a prophecy.

377
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,689
Do you mind?

378
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,392
Boy, he really sucks the fun
out of everything. Doesn't he?

379
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,875
Fun sucker!

380
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,116
I read this tablet front to back.

381
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,973
And the story it tells is very disturbing.

382
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:37,315
Every hundred million years or so,

383
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,550
the world gets a cosmic cleansing.

384
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,079
Before the dinosaurs,

385
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,118
there were these horseshoe
crab-looking thingies.

386
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,437
Then, at the bottom of this mountain range,

387
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,834
an asteroid hit.

388
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,150
Boom! Bye-bye.

389
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,437
Next, dinosaurs, mountain range, asteroid.

390
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,953
Boom! Bye-bye.

391
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,395
And coming up next, mammals.

392
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,471
Mountain range, asteroid, boom!

393
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,960
Bye-bye.

394
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,413
Stupid mammals.

395
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,674
That's us.

396
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,936
Yep, and there she is.

397
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,834
The mother of all asteroids
screaming towards us.

398
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,508
Even going underground
won't save us this time.

399
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,835
Hey, that wasn't there before.

400
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,911
And look what it's doing to the sky.

401
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,310
No worries.
Because I've got a plan.

402
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,140
Really? To stop an asteroid?

403
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,636
Look, the last two asteroids

404
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,911
have pummeled the earth
in the same spot.

405
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,991
And it's about to happen again.

406
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,473
We've got to go there,

407
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,712
and see what's attracting the asteroid.

408
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,618
Once we know why it's coming,

409
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,910
we can figure out how
to send it somewhere else.

410
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,493
That plan is so dumb,

411
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,855
I wish it had a face so I could smack it.

412
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,955
Let me get this straight.

413
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,059
Instead of running away
from a deadly asteroid,

414
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:54,055
you want us to run directly towards it?

415
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:57,439
I know it sounds suboptimal,
but the good news is,

416
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,535
it'll kill us no matter where we went.

417
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,399
Well, that's reassuring.

418
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,909
Ok, but even if
we get to the crash site,

419
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,513
how are we supposed to change

420
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,034
what is literally written in stone?

421
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,277
My cynical friend.

422
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,878
The dinos were wiped off the face
of the Earth but some escaped.

423
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,073
They changed their fate
and we can change ours, too.

424
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,771
Who's with me?

425
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,431
So, what do you think?

426
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,879
Honestly, I'm worried the weasel's right.

427
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,040
No!
Don't listen to the weasel.

428
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,054
He's a raving loon!

429
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,554
Sorry. I just love playing devil's advocate.

430
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,629
And looking fabulous!

431
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:42,074
Well, Buck has saved
our lives before, right?

432
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,117
But what if he can't this time?

433
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,838
I don't know what to believe.

434
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,868
But I'm afraid our lives will be over
before they begin.

435
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,369
Ok.

436
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,551
I guess we're in.

437
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,196
Crash and Eddie reporting for duty.

438
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,480
Doody.

439
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,779
Excellent!
And dirty word processed.

440
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,579
Now, we better get on the road,

441
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:10,038
because time till impact is roughly 2 days,

442
00:30:10,263 --> 00:30:12,055
4 hours, 1 minute and 16 seconds.

443
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,497
15 seconds, 14 seconds...

444
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,089
I think we get it.

445
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,913
I think we're all gonna get it.

446
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,756
We look so cool.

447
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,150
What is this stuff?

448
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,432
Where is he?

449
00:30:58,833 --> 00:31:02,396
When I am through with that one-eyed weasel
he's going to need two eye patches.

450
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,899
I admire your bloodthirstitude, Gertie.

451
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:07,949
But you heard them.

452
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,831
An asteroid is coming.

453
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,558
This changes things.

454
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,710
Holy snowballs!
It's freezing up here.

455
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,975
Parts are retracting into other parts.

456
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:22,974
Would you please stop
acting like a parakeet?

457
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,615
It's a good thing you got
your mother's eyes,

458
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,659
or you'd be totally useless.

459
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,032
Well, that's just hurtful.

460
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,008
What do you see?

461
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,000
Nothing.

462
00:31:36,805 --> 00:31:37,805
Nothing.

463
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,550
Deadly asteroid screaming towards Earth.

464
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,118
Wait! There he is.

465
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,618
That's too bad.

466
00:31:44,743 --> 00:31:46,262
He is really far away.

467
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,118
Probably too far to reach by flight.

468
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,828
Oh, well.
Let's just go home.

469
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,792
We are not retreating!

470
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,778
Until that weasel came along,

471
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,910
our family made an honest living,

472
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,494
stealing dino eggs.

473
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,569
An honest living. Stealing.

474
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,113
Kind of ironic, don't you think?

475
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,790
Besides, why take out the weasel,

476
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,811
if the asteroid is just gonna take us out?

477
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,394
So much sight.
So little vision.

478
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,869
If we stop the wease and his friends,

479
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,732
from diverting the asteroid...

480
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,800
Kablooie!

481
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,440
It kills the weasel and everyone else...

482
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:20,434
while we glide safely above it all.

483
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,273
It'll be our paradise.

484
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,989
That's seems highly implausible.

485
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,079
Just from a scientific standpoint.

486
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,940
Fine. It's a great plan.
Dynamite!

487
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,752
One of the top three or four
species annihilation plans I've ever heard.

488
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,194
That's better.

489
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,669
Now let's make sure that asteroid hits.

490
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,668
Why can't we just fear the apocalypse
like a normal family?

491
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,634
What are you doing, Buck?

492
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,631
All rocks tell a tale.

493
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,398
Where we've been
and where we're heading.

494
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,788
That, however, is a turd.

495
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,855
Julian..

496
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:47,137
I want you to know
that if we don't make it,

497
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,250
if we never get married,

498
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,433
you were the only one for me.

499
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,676
Hey, come on!

500
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,459
Of course we'll make it,
and we will get married.

501
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,909
But maybe it's the universe
telling us we won't.

502
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,795
You're going to let one tiny little,

503
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:05,852
300-mile-wide asteroid ruin your plans?

504
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,799
How can we think about our future
when we may not have one?

505
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,679
Hey, we're going to stop this thing,

506
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:11,975
and you'll get married.

507
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,855
Well, not boom.
Forget I said boom.

508
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,995
I know!
I'll be your wedding planner!

509
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,272
It'll take your mind off
all this end-of-the-world stuff.

510
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,729
Actually, we were just gonna wing it!

511
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,960
Keep it low-key.

512
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,513
What?

513
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,539
Peaches, Peaches. Sweetheart.

514
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:33,293
You don't just wing
the happiest day of your life!

515
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,558
No, you seize it and you cherish it.

516
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,975
You strangle it with good intentions.

517
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:42,396
Let's start with your hair.

518
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,439
Updo with a top bun?

519
00:35:44,564 --> 00:35:45,797
Traditional.

520
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,539
Or updo with a fishtail braid.

521
00:35:48,764 --> 00:35:50,123
Flirtatious.

522
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,110
But maybe a little trashy.

523
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,819
And garter belts!

524
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,179
Today, Ed is modelling laced daisies.

525
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,795
While Crash is rocking a more elegant ivy,

526
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,552
that's all about the calves.

527
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,772
We need a seating chart!

528
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,189
The singles table, the kids table,

529
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,599
the weird relatives table,

530
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:13,433
the smelly table, two more smelly tables.

531
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,160
Look at him.

532
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,399
You're gonna love it.

533
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,159
Who walks like that?

534
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:20,211
Look at me.

535
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,595
I'm Julian.

536
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,013
Forget the asteroid.

537
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,436
Gimme a hug, Bro-Dad!

538
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,009
Look at that pretty bird there.

539
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,754
Yeah! That is a pretty bird.

540
00:36:32,279 --> 00:36:33,360
Good eye, Manny.

541
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,499
Yeah. The sky is literally falling,

542
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,340
and she thinks we're just gonna
let her stroll into the wilderness,

543
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,391
with Mr. No Plans Bouncy Walk.

544
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,893
Stop picking on him.

545
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,673
Come on El, you're not
still mad at me, are you?

546
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,433
No. I'm not still mad.

547
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:50,759
Because that's not how I want to spend
what could be our final days together.

548
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:54,459
But if we somehow survive
that planet-killing hunk of space rock,

549
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,760
you're in for it.

550
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:57,665
If we survive, we lose our daughter.

551
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,657
Well, I've been thinking about that, too.

552
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,419
What if...

553
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,829
I know!
We destroy the relationship, right?

554
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,592
That way we never have to let her go,

555
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,513
and she'll just stay our little girl forever!

556
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,191
No, you psychopath!

557
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,830
What if we convince them to stay near us?

558
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:20,111
That's better.
I like it. But how?

559
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,271
The way we always
get her to do what we want.

560
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,570
We make her think it's her idea.

561
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,292
You sneaky, sneaky minx!

562
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,589
Let's just hope we haven't lost our touch.

563
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,815
Found it!

564
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,553
Behold, mammals!

565
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,718
A sneak preview of the asteroid to come.

566
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,099
A space rock.

567
00:37:39,524 --> 00:37:41,574
Fresh from the cosmos.

568
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,455
I taste iron, carbon.

569
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,935
And a hint of nickel.

570
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,032
Space tastes lonely.

571
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,037
Hey, look!
I found another one.

572
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,240
Me, too!

573
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,073
Hey! Yours is attracted to me.

574
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,708
No. Yours is attracted to me.

575
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,389
We're just too attractive!

576
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,671
Stupendous!

577
00:38:13,695 --> 00:38:16,391
Now we have something
to play with during our final hours.

578
00:38:16,415 --> 00:38:18,439
You're missing the point, Tiger.

579
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,653
They're magnets.

580
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,790
And if these space rocks are magnetic,

581
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,075
so is that.

582
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,651
This can only mean one thing.

583
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,797
And that would be...

584
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,795
Allow me.

585
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,748
Where are we?

586
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,956
You are in my brain.

587
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,429
Kind of chilly.

588
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,989
Gentlemen, here's what we know.

589
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,861
Space rocks? Magnetic.

590
00:38:46,986 --> 00:38:48,972
Asteroid? Also, magnetic.

591
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,716
Famed astrophysicist Neil deBuck Weasel!

592
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,099
He knows the cosmos.

593
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,569
Ipso facto, thusly and ergo,

594
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,596
the crash site must have
a heap of these things

595
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,412
attracting the asteroid.

596
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:03,308
Pythagoras Buck.
He's got the right angle.

597
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:06,440
What if we use the magnets
to attract the asteroids somewhere else?

598
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,052
As in, not towards Earth.

599
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,758
Theoretically speaking,

600
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,349
if we can launch enough
of these into space,

601
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,715
they will pull the asteroid off course.

602
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,631
Thus, saving the world.

603
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,639
So, we just need to go to the crash site,

604
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,949
and launch a bunch of rocks into space.

605
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,296
That's easy, right?

606
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,993
Oh, yeah.
Sounds like a real piece of cake.

607
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,639
This is progress!

608
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,075
Now we know exactly what
we don't know how to do.

609
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,873
Vamanos, mammals!

610
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,659
This trail will take us directly to the crash site.

611
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,779
All right, kids.

612
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,052
Let's have some fun.

613
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,151
Ok, everyone.
Follow the trail.

614
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,390
Never leave the trail.

615
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,396
Okay, everyone.
Leave the trail.

616
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,993
Into the forest.
Chop, chop.

617
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,291
But you just said...

618
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,840
You know I'm crazy. Come on.

619
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,449
I love the shade.
Don't you?

620
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,033
Well played, weasel.

621
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,449
Stay sharp, kids.

622
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,551
They can't hide forever.

623
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,560
Hey, Buck.

624
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,014
You have a suggestion
for getting around the river?

625
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,331
Let's see if the tablet's
ancient wisdom will guide us.

626
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,228
Let my mammals pass!

627
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,998
That's never gonna work.

628
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,998
The ancients grant us safe passage.

629
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,656
Sweet!

630
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,869
The air feels strange.

631
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:00,849
Diego?

632
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,060
What?

633
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,631
Finally! We have superpowers!

634
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,309
Ladies and gentlemen,

635
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:32,533
we have wandered into an electrical storm.

636
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,988
I suggest we all stay away from the trees.

637
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:37,749
Sure, no problem.

638
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,193
It's not like we're in a forest.

639
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:48,077
Boy, Mother Nature sure
is in a bad mood lately.

640
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:50,608
Good thing we're all here
to help each other.

641
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:54,036
Oh, like I always say,
stay close, stay alive.

642
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,555
There they are!

643
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,694
Right out in the open.

644
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,918
How stupid can you be?

645
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,230
Come on, kids. Dive!

646
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:18,428
Everyone, try not to create
any sort of friction.

647
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,431
No friction. Got it.

648
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,397
Yup. Cool beans.

649
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,198
Friction is what now?

650
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:26,879
Oh, no.

651
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,437
Come on!
Let's get out of here.

652
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,028
Hurry, Granny.

653
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,435
Don't you hurry me.

654
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,855
I've been struck by lightning more times...

655
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,319
Granny!

656
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,796
Than you've had hot breakfasts.

657
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:00,960
Peaches!

658
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,310
Julian, don't move!

659
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,440
Oh!

660
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,353
I have an idea.

661
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,078
I'm coming, sweetheart!

662
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,478
Julian, why aren't you helping her?

663
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,556
Wait! No, Manny, she...

664
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,439
What are you guys doing?

665
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:23,635
Helping?

666
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,438
What would not helping look like?

667
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,393
Hey, zapheads!

668
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,836
Manny, get ready to run.

669
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:41,312
Come on, let's go!

670
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:54,309
Everybody make it?

671
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,391
Shira, Manny, Crash, Eddie, Ellie, Granny.

672
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,391
Shoot!
I'm out of fingers.

673
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,232
Buck. Where's Buck?

674
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,069
Do you hear that?

675
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:06,675
A baby!

676
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,831
There's a baby in there!

677
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,475
Buck, wait!
It's too dangerous.

678
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:18,834
He's gone.

679
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,513
I can't believe it.

680
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:23,513
Don't know how we'll
go on without you, Buck.

681
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:25,692
All right, let's go.

682
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:29,669
It's Buck!

683
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,798
I got you.
Don't worry, I got you.

684
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,350
There you are. There.

685
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:42,669
Say hi, everyone.

686
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,357
Isn't she gorgeous?

687
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,357
How can he tell it's a she?

688
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:52,875
Such a good little poochie-woochie.

689
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,394
Just to be clear, that's a pumpkin, right?

690
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:01,197
Well I mean, she has a little jaundice,
but I think she'll be okay.

691
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:03,112
Yes, you will.

692
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:07,034
I think I'll call you...
Bronwyn.

693
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:09,855
Little buddy?
We need you back on planet Earth.

694
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,115
While it's still here. Okay?

695
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:13,469
Right you are, mammal.

696
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:17,235
Who wants to save the world
from the fiery asteroid?

697
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:18,320
You do!

698
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,831
Okay, mammals.
Let's stop here for the night.

699
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,911
Stop? What about the whole

700
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,592
end of the world collision thing?

701
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,671
Oh, asteroid's still a day off.

702
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:48,274
And like my grandfather used to say...

703
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,233
Red sky at night, sailor's delight.

704
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,512
Purple sky at night,
who moved my foot cream?

705
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:56,591
I need my foot cream.

706
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:59,354
Grampy was a confused and angry weasel.

707
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,429
You are so funny, J.

708
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:04,833
Stop! You're funny.

709
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,474
Take it easy, my brother from a tiger mother.

710
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,871
Hasta manana, J-man.

711
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:13,839
What was that?

712
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,194
What was what?

713
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,991
Oh, that! It's a cool way to peace out.

714
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:20,189
Julian taught it to me.

715
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:22,769
Well, I'm glad the apocalypse
is bringing you together.

716
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,274
He's a good kid, Manny.
I like his philosophy.

717
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,571
Give him a chance.
Bond with him.

718
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:29,598
♪ <i>So light 'em up, up, up</i> ♪

719
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,954
♪ <i>Light 'em up, up, up</i> ♪

720
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:35,033
♪ <i>Light 'em up, up, up ♪
♪ I'm on fire</i> ♪

721
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:38,119
Bonding!
That's a good idea!

722
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:40,795
Oh, right. Got you.

723
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,797
You take Julian.
I got an idea for Peaches.

724
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,156
Hey, Bro-Kid.

725
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:51,595
Oh, hey, Bro-Dad.
You here to rock out?

726
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:54,873
Okay. Instead of that...

727
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:57,471
how about a game before bedtime?

728
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:00,589
No way! You want to play
a game with me?

729
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:04,079
What is honored times 1,000?

730
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:05,753
No! Times one million?

731
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:09,515
'Cause whatever that equals,
is how honored I am.

732
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,750
So, is that a yes?

733
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,979
Yes, that's a yes.
It's the most yes!

734
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:18,477
It's like yes with a bunch of s's...
so it's like yes.

735
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:21,040
Great!

736
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:23,210
I'll see you on the ice!

737
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:28,395
Happy?

738
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:37,794
Oh, boy.

739
00:48:44,595 --> 00:48:45,595
So,

740
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:48,359
do you think you're ready
to go out roaming on your own?

741
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:50,710
I won't be alone.
I'll have Julian.

742
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:53,398
Sure. But with asteroids flying,

743
00:48:53,923 --> 00:48:56,851
no home to speak of
and absolutely no support system,

744
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,599
do you think you'll be ready for...

745
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:00,020
this?

746
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:03,231
I'm a wittle baby.

747
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,955
Imagine. You're in the woods,
looking for food,

748
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:09,469
and your baby gets sick.
What do you do?

749
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,950
No! Jiggling makes her feel worse!

750
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,517
Oh, no! Now your older toddler

751
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:21,968
has a skinned knee and a stuffy nose.

752
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:23,908
Mommy, hold me!

753
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:25,399
Now your babies are crying.

754
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:27,471
You have no food and then

755
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:30,273
you come face to face with a rabid beast!

756
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:36,591
I am a rabid beast who
gives rabies to babies.

757
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,470
And there's an arsonist on the loose.

758
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:48,955
How are you going to handle
all this without our help?

759
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,313
Peaches, out!

760
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:16,299
Well, that's just the easy stuff.

761
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:18,869
There's a lot more we still need to cover.

762
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:22,715
Baby made a poopie.

763
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:27,470
I'm a method actor,
so I will need to be changed.

764
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:30,618
So close!

765
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:32,616
These pucks go fast.

766
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:35,858
Just watch the puck
all the way into the stick.

767
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:40,812
I did it!

768
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:43,250
Too bad you and Peaches are moving away.

769
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:45,515
If you stayed,
we could do this all the time.

770
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,954
Ok. Show me the heat!

771
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:50,151
I'm like a hockey ninja!

772
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:54,753
Hey, Peaches!

773
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:58,239
Looks like you got a new hockey partner
to replace your dad.

774
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:06,079
Oh, no.

775
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:11,359
Julian!

776
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:17,235
Such a mystery why he wants
to move far away.

777
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:18,753
I didn't mean to do it.

778
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:20,870
It's not my fault the kid has no reflexes.

779
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:22,376
How could you do that to him?

780
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:23,874
I thought you liked Julian.

781
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:24,880
I do like Julian.

782
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,189
Well, you don't act like it.

783
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:28,994
When you look at him,
all you see is an obstacle.

784
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:30,618
Or worse, a target.

785
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:32,717
But I see a sweet guy,

786
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:35,532
who's trying his hardest to impress you.

787
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:37,870
Peaches.
No! Both of you, just stop!

788
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:39,871
If we survive, I'm still getting married

789
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:41,388
and I'm still leaving home.

790
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,655
Whether you're happy for me or not.

791
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,916
Don't give me that look.
She said both.

792
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:50,911
That means you too.

793
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:55,037
And this widdle astewoid

794
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:57,270
went wee, wee, wee, all the way home.

795
00:51:58,800 --> 00:51:59,800
Hey...

796
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:06,149
Because Daddy and his
fwiends saved the world.

797
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:19,989
♪ <i>And if that pterodactyl don't fly</i> ♪

798
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:23,516
♪ <i>Daddy's gonna blind ♪
♪ his remaining eye</i> ♪

799
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:30,191
Sweet dreams, little one.

800
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,709
Lucky pumpkin!

801
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,195
It must be nice to have a loving father.

802
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:38,587
Ok, here we go.

803
00:52:38,912 --> 00:52:40,397
You can do this, Roger.

804
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,378
Kidnapping!

805
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:47,031
Look I'm sorry. It's not me.

806
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:48,416
I would never do
something like this.

807
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:50,295
It's my father. He's crazy.

808
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,030
I can't believe he pulled it off!

809
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,838
Way to go, dum-dum!

810
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,319
Thanks, Dad.

811
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,710
Whatever! I could've done the same thing.

812
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:02,959
Well, well.

813
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:07,034
Looks like you're not stopping that
asteroid now, are you, weasel?

814
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:10,280
That's not the weasel.
That's...

815
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:12,910
I don't know what that is?

816
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,678
Is it my time, angel?

817
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,474
Time for what?

818
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,678
I'm coming to the light.

819
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:26,152
Can't wait to see all those
dead relatives I hate.

820
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:28,416
Get it off! Get it off! Get it off!

821
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:29,979
Go help your sister.

822
00:53:30,003 --> 00:53:31,109
But, Dad...

823
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:33,319
Demon angel!

824
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:38,400
Mess with Granny,
get knocked on your fanny.

825
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:44,830
And that's how it's done.

826
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:48,254
Hello? Angel?

827
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:49,669
Am I in heaven?

828
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,910
It's so dark and squishy in here.

829
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,794
Oh, no! I can still see the light.

830
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:04,556
Pop! I'll save you.

831
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:11,960
Hello!

832
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,017
Well. Probably for the best.

833
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:20,433
Yeah, probably.
Definitely.

834
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:33,760
Crikey!

835
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:40,053
Good gravy, Buck.
What have you done?

836
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,311
All right, mammals.
Time to get moving.

837
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:43,889
Now let's not linger on this,

838
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:44,979
but yes,

839
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:48,157
I read the tablet wrong.
The asteroid is a lot closer.

840
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:54,832
Wait a second.
Where's Granny?

841
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:56,842
Granny?

842
00:54:57,067 --> 00:54:58,253
Granny?

843
00:54:58,260 --> 00:54:59,579
Maybe she wandered off?

844
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:01,492
Maybe she got hit in the head with a puck?

845
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:03,079
Yes! And maybe she was abducted

846
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:04,832
by homicidal 30-foot dino-birds,

847
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,433
seeking revenge on me.

848
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:09,192
All good theories.
I'm going to go with the puck.

849
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:12,159
I knew it!

850
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:15,332
So this whole time we've been
chased by giant dino-birds?

851
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:18,752
Oh, only three!
I didn't want to damage morale.

852
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:20,159
Right. Because before this,

853
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,199
we were on a carefree pleasure cruise.

854
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:23,279
Wait a second.

855
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,815
I've got her scent. Come on!

856
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:40,799
Mammals, we've made it!

857
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:42,718
The crash site.

858
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:45,514
This must be what's left
of the previous asteroid.

859
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,817
Buck?
Your space rocks!

860
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:54,348
We could definitely divert the asteroid
with a magnet that size!

861
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:56,112
I mean that thing is enormous.

862
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:57,514
It's massive, it's...

863
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,955
Going to be impossible to get off the ground.

864
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:01,513
It's entirely possible.

865
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:04,353
In a way that we don't know about yet.

866
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:06,158
But what about the dino-birds?

867
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:08,151
And what about Granny?

868
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:10,799
Nothing.

869
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:12,914
I'm sorry, Sid.

870
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:18,611
Granny.
My sweet, malicious Granny.

871
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:22,056
Why does it always have to be
the old ones who go first?

872
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:23,320
Why?

873
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,912
I can still hear her sweet, shrill voice...

874
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,196
shrieking from the afterlife.

875
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:34,229
Granny's alive!

876
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:35,509
And she's in trouble!

877
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:44,533
Granny?

878
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,831
Granny?
Granny?

879
00:56:58,520 --> 00:56:59,639
Is she ok?

880
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:01,677
I'm not sure.

881
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:08,173
Unhand my Granny!

882
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:10,151
You do and you don't get a tip.

883
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:11,917
Making this beautiful sloth happy,

884
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:13,872
is all the payment I need.

885
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:16,354
You see?
Hunky bunny gets it.

886
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:17,769
Granny!

887
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:20,493
There's a bunny living in the asteroid?

888
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,233
Did not see that coming.

889
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,509
Wait till you see this!

890
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:37,395
Yeah!

891
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:39,710
Catching mad air on the half-pipe!

892
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:41,114
This is crazy.

893
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:42,475
Do you think they know

894
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:44,391
they are living in a magnetic bull's-eye?

895
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:47,512
Doesn't look like a lot of
doomsday prepping going on in here.

896
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:48,914
I can't believe it!

897
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:50,195
Visitors!

898
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:52,520
We've never had visitors.

899
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:55,759
Somebody pinch me.
Or should I pinch you?

900
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,114
Wait, I'll pinch both of us.

901
00:57:58,440 --> 00:57:59,486
Did I hit my head?

902
00:57:59,611 --> 00:58:01,037
What's happening here?

903
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:03,911
I sure hope this isn't a...

904
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:07,551
dream!

905
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:11,294
♪ <i>Dream Weaver</i> ♪

906
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:15,671
♪ <i>I believe you can ♪
♪ get me through the night</i> ♪

907
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,116
This guy? For real?

908
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:22,457
Whatever.

909
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,118
Well. Hello, handsome.

910
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:29,633
I'm Brooke.

911
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:33,749
Such exquisite bone structure.

912
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:35,698
Such a strong jaw.

913
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:38,269
I'm getting butterflies!

914
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:40,072
I'm getting nauseous.

915
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:42,236
Sorry to interrupt this
weirdo love connection,

916
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:43,739
but we're kind of in a hurry.

917
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:45,199
If we don't do something fast,

918
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:48,377
that asteroid is gonna
blow us all to smithereens.

919
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:51,595
That sounds urgent.

920
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:53,632
I better take you to him.

921
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,756
Who's him? Your leader?

922
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:58,474
He is our everything.

923
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,039
He sees all.

924
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:01,428
He knows all.

925
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:04,194
And smells amazing!

926
00:59:04,218 --> 00:59:06,695
Ok. Ok. He sounds great. Let's go!

927
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:08,916
Brilliant.
Right this way.

928
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:17,840
Yes!

929
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,996
Please keep your arms and legs

930
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:25,509
inside the tram at all times.

931
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:28,856
But allow your spirit to roam free...

932
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:31,355
in Geotopia.

933
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:33,476
I have a good feeling about this.

934
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:35,073
Maybe he'll be able to help us.

935
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:36,798
She did say he knows all.

936
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,638
And all's a lot!

937
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:44,359
Here he is.

938
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:48,054
The Master of Meditation,
the Supreme Serene,

939
00:59:48,178 --> 00:59:51,629
the four-time Heavy Thoughts
champion of the world!

940
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:07,273
Is that a llama?
I hate llamas.

941
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:08,978
They spit and smell.

942
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:10,280
So does she.

943
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:11,612
So do we!

944
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:23,339
Greetings, mammals!

945
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,793
The Shangri Llama will see you...

946
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:30,809
now.

947
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:31,980
Wonderful.

948
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:34,635
So where is he?

949
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:36,770
He is here.
Talking to you.

950
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:41,114
I get it. He's a ventriloquist
and you're the dummy.

951
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:43,439
No, you're the dummy.
No, you're the dummy.

952
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:44,440
No, you're the dummy.

953
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:45,896
This is the guy that's going to save us.

954
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:46,996
Look within.
You're the dummy.

955
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:50,711
Disgusting! Loved that!

956
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:53,440
New topic.
We're all about to die.

957
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:56,058
Well, that's no good.
Stress is a killer.

958
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:59,314
Let us loosen our limbs
and open our minds.

959
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:00,654
Downward Dog!

960
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:03,213
Seriously?

961
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:04,028
I'll wait.

962
01:01:04,253 --> 01:01:06,196
I have all the time in the world.

963
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:11,816
Actually, you don't have
all the time in the world.

964
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:12,855
None of us do.

965
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:15,159
You see, there's this thing in the sky.

966
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:18,760
That blinding light that seems
to get larger by the minute?

967
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,670
What about it?
Seems fine to me.

968
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:23,577
With all due respect, Your Twistiness,

969
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:24,949
that's an asteroid.

970
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:26,997
It's magnetically attracted to this place

971
01:01:27,021 --> 01:01:28,838
and it's heading straight for us.

972
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:33,115
It must desire our magnetic crystals.

973
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:34,548
Well, who can blame it?

974
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:36,053
They're really quite something.

975
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:38,470
Did you know their power
grants eternal youth?

976
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,608
I am over 400 years old.

977
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:42,792
That's not possible.
Sure it is.

978
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,553
I'm 326!

979
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:48,678
You don't look a day over 275.

980
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:51,029
We are young, happy and safe.

981
01:01:51,154 --> 01:01:52,601
And we always will be.

982
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:54,813
Thanks to Geotopia!

983
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:57,198
Kudos. It is lovely.

984
01:01:57,360 --> 01:02:00,033
Now, let's figure out
a way to launch it into space!

985
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:02,350
I'm sorry.
You want to destroy our home?

986
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:04,312
It'll be destroyed either way.

987
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:07,869
But if we propel this magnetic material
into the atmosphere,

988
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:10,838
we can change the asteroid's
path and save everyone.

989
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,299
What do you say?

990
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:13,840
Caterpillar!

991
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:17,513
So, is that a yes or?

992
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:23,195
You are storing a lot of hostility
in your lower spine.

993
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:25,336
Shangri Llama, how are we gonna...

994
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:27,833
Funky Chicken. Jiggy Jelly.
Mashed Potato.

995
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:30,475
Your flexibility is a sight to behold.

996
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:33,360
Now how the devil are we going
to launch these crystals?

997
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:35,232
You can't.
It's impossible.

998
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:37,431
I am bushed.

999
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:40,874
Awesome meeting you guys.

1000
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:43,190
Feel free to hang or, you know, whatever.

1001
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:48,673
That's it.
He was our last hope.

1002
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:50,155
We're doomed.

1003
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:52,590
Yeah. All we got was a free yoga class.

1004
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:54,520
On that subject...

1005
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:56,913
could you help me, please?

1006
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:59,519
My nose is dangerously close to my butt.

1007
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:02,373
Sid, why do you have two tails?

1008
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:04,078
I'm in here, too.

1009
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:12,619
Hey, don't cry.

1010
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:14,353
Look on the bright side.

1011
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:17,797
We get to see our lives flash before our eyes.

1012
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:21,849
That means I get to fall in love with you,

1013
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:23,439
all over again.

1014
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:26,751
Only you can make the end of the world

1015
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:28,272
sound like a good thing.

1016
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:35,870
We did a good job raising her.

1017
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:37,632
She's stronger than we know.

1018
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:41,270
Two days ago, I'd have given
anything to keep her with us.

1019
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:44,591
Now I'd give anything
just to see her get married,

1020
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,133
and leave home.

1021
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:47,472
Play with her kids,

1022
01:03:47,497 --> 01:03:49,102
dance with her husband.

1023
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:51,715
Yell at him when he forgets their anniversary.

1024
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:55,958
It was a good one, wasn't it?

1025
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:59,592
Our life?
You, me, and Peaches.

1026
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:00,953
The best.

1027
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:07,638
Brooke.

1028
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:09,313
You're so pretty.

1029
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:11,695
You take my lisp away.

1030
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:14,794
I bet you say that to all the girls.

1031
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:17,872
I try. But usually they run away too fast.

1032
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:21,470
You're such a romantic.

1033
01:04:21,780 --> 01:04:24,613
Hey, I know this is going
to sound super forward...

1034
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:27,877
but will you be my mate for life?

1035
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:30,974
Brooke, I don't know what to say.

1036
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:33,351
It's only been twelve minutes.

1037
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:35,192
What took you so long?

1038
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:39,308
Yes! This has been
the best last day on Earth ever.

1039
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:41,558
A diamond!
I need a diamond!

1040
01:04:41,582 --> 01:04:42,695
Where can I find a...

1041
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:44,737
Perfect.

1042
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:48,414
No, no, no.
Sid, sweetie, don't do that.

1043
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:51,310
Nonsense. Only the best for my one...

1044
01:04:52,235 --> 01:04:53,235
true...

1045
01:04:53,875 --> 01:04:54,775
love.

1046
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:08,256
Whopsies!

1047
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:09,374
No, no, no!

1048
01:05:10,460 --> 01:05:12,218
Simpleton!
Nincompoop!

1049
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:14,138
You talking to her or me?

1050
01:05:14,162 --> 01:05:17,289
That wall was the one
thing keeping us young.

1051
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:21,148
Now we're all doomed! Doomed!

1052
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:23,599
And now, I think I have a fever.

1053
01:05:23,723 --> 01:05:25,498
Thank you so much, doofus!

1054
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:27,671
Hey! Easy there, Llama!

1055
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:29,412
This is the doofus of my dreams.

1056
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:30,669
He meant well.

1057
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:31,989
He meant well.

1058
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:33,312
Who cares?

1059
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:35,075
So much for serenity.

1060
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:37,435
300 years of peace and harmony,

1061
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:40,062
undone by one colossally,

1062
01:05:40,287 --> 01:05:41,776
incredibly,

1063
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:44,878
stupendously stupid sloth!

1064
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:57,480
Brooke.

1065
01:05:58,420 --> 01:05:59,890
You guys got old.

1066
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:01,851
Whatever we had, it's over.

1067
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:04,388
That's what happens when you date a cougar.

1068
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:06,651
I'm really sorry, Mr. Llama.

1069
01:06:07,780 --> 01:06:09,419
Sorry. Sorry?

1070
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:12,189
Sorry doesn't fix the wall now,
does it, you little...

1071
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:16,037
I need a bubble bath or a massage.

1072
01:06:16,061 --> 01:06:17,594
Who knows acupuncture?

1073
01:06:17,660 --> 01:06:19,252
I need to let my anger out.

1074
01:06:19,277 --> 01:06:20,562
Let it out!

1075
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:22,409
I've been pent up too long.

1076
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:27,388
I want to hit something.
Someone give me their face.

1077
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:30,259
That's it! Pent-up energy.

1078
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:33,853
Earth's most powerful propulsion device
is right in front of us.

1079
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:36,036
Who? Spitty McGee here?

1080
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:39,479
The volcano!

1081
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:41,437
That's our magnet launcher.

1082
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:44,439
All we need to do is seal
the steam vents around it.

1083
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:46,960
That's a crazy plan!

1084
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:48,109
You're a crazy plan.

1085
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:49,793
That doesn't even make any sense.

1086
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:51,440
And what are you?
A professor of logic?

1087
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:52,959
Professor Kitty McWhiskers

1088
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:54,760
of the University of Meow Meow Meow Meow...

1089
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:58,971
You see? Tremendous pressure
leads to a tremendous explosion.

1090
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:02,510
And you call yourself a professor.

1091
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:06,479
Right. We need all the crystals
loaded into the volcano, pronto.

1092
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:07,789
What? No!

1093
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:09,473
I'm not giving you my crystals.

1094
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:11,698
We need them to rebuild our sanctuary.

1095
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:18,354
May I remind you
Geotopia is not yours to keep.

1096
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:19,520
No, you may not.

1097
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:21,352
It came from the sky,

1098
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:23,232
and now it's time to give it back.

1099
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:24,320
Is not!

1100
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:25,998
Is too, you old coot.

1101
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:28,674
Change isn't easy, but it's part of life.

1102
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:31,035
It's time for us to embrace it again.

1103
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:33,191
Whether you like it or not.

1104
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:34,360
Not!

1105
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:37,870
Listen, Llama, I will go nuts
and granola on your butt!

1106
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:39,632
So either get on board,

1107
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:41,870
or go twist yourself into a pretzel

1108
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,718
and na-ma-stay out of our way.

1109
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:45,279
Come on, everybody.

1110
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:47,191
Grab every crystal you can find.

1111
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:49,157
Totally, let's do it!

1112
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:51,834
And remember, lift with your legs.

1113
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:53,718
Too late.

1114
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:58,351
Listen up, planetary defense team.

1115
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:00,795
Step one, build pressure

1116
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:03,229
inside the volcano by sealing the vents.

1117
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,200
No steam can escape.

1118
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:06,475
If there's a leak...

1119
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:08,631
the pressure is weak.

1120
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:16,996
Step two, get the biggest magnetic crystals

1121
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:18,195
into the volcano.

1122
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:20,271
They've got to be launched sky high

1123
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:22,157
to pull the asteroid off course.

1124
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:27,878
Heave!
Ho!

1125
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:29,758
Heave!
Ho!

1126
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:31,717
<i>Rah rah! Sis boom bah!</i>

1127
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:33,080
<i>Tell that asteroid.</i>

1128
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:35,240
# Asteroid!

1129
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:36,400
# WhatDoesHashTagMean?

1130
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:38,073
# IDon'tKnowButltSoundsCool!

1131
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:39,240
# Totally!

1132
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:40,839
# I'mStartingToGetSickOflt!

1133
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:45,949
This is it, friends.
Down the hatch.

1134
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:47,599
Every crystal counts.

1135
01:08:58,400 --> 01:08:59,674
Good news, everyone!

1136
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:01,637
We're six minutes ahead of schedule.

1137
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:04,711
Somebody up there likes us.

1138
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:32,279
Bad news! Somebody up there
doesn't like us.

1139
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:34,670
We're six minutes behind schedule!

1140
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:38,752
Double time, everyone.
We need that big crystal.

1141
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:46,154
Hey, Bro-Dad!

1142
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:00,234
We got company!

1143
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:02,436
I'll put out the sponge cake.

1144
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:10,533
Steady.

1145
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:12,335
Steady.

1146
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:16,059
Sorry about this.

1147
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:18,011
I'm really conflicted right now.

1148
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,931
That's more like it, Roger.

1149
01:10:23,056 --> 01:10:24,334
Now finish him.

1150
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:26,112
Wait! Wait, you don't understand.

1151
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:27,613
You see that?

1152
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:29,831
If that asteroid hits, we all die.

1153
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,858
If it hits, we all die.

1154
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,479
That's where you're wrong.

1155
01:10:35,503 --> 01:10:37,676
See, while you run for
your mammal lives,

1156
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:40,040
we'll be high in the sky,

1157
01:10:40,365 --> 01:10:42,076
cruising above it all.

1158
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:46,057
That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard!

1159
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:49,519
We'll be as safe as those little birdies.

1160
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:52,191
Lucky shot.

1161
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:55,477
Very lucky shot?

1162
01:10:57,320 --> 01:10:59,053
I knew it. I was right.

1163
01:10:59,278 --> 01:11:00,734
There's no paradise.

1164
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:03,289
What? I'm too young to go extinct!

1165
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:08,315
She gets it! Now, please,
we haven't got much time!

1166
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:11,315
What are you waiting for?
Kill him!

1167
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:13,748
No, Dad. I won't let you.

1168
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:16,290
Do you want to know what
I love about our family?

1169
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:18,412
That we're alive.

1170
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:20,899
There are more important things
than your pride right now.

1171
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:22,998
If you care about us,

1172
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:24,912
you should not kill him.

1173
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:27,236
You should help him, Dad.

1174
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:29,395
Pop, I hate to say this,

1175
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:31,470
but my freaky little brother may be right.

1176
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:35,510
As a father, I would
work with my worst enemy,

1177
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:38,795
to ensure a brighter future for my little one.

1178
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:49,455
Reinforcements have arrived!

1179
01:11:57,080 --> 01:12:00,177
All right, Roger.
Lead the way.

1180
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:08,278
So that's what approval sounds like.

1181
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:11,193
Keep it up, dinos.

1182
01:12:11,217 --> 01:12:13,191
Use that Jurassic super strength!

1183
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:17,993
Beep, beep, beep.

1184
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:27,979
Watch out, kids!

1185
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:39,894
The weasel has landed.

1186
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:43,655
I'll push it in.
Go with Peaches and Ellie!

1187
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:47,640
No!

1188
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:50,360
I'm not leaving you!
We'll do this together!

1189
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:57,319
Mom, where are they?

1190
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:01,469
Ellie, we've got to get
everyone off the volcano.

1191
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:05,214
Folks, I'm outta cake, but I got salami!

1192
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:06,280
Faster, faster!

1193
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:07,509
I'mouttacakebutlgotsalami!

1194
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:09,200
Granny, come on!
Hey!

1195
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:18,830
This isn't working.

1196
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:23,256
Mad air on the half-pipe!

1197
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:25,476
Manny, I have a plan!

1198
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:27,471
We have to let the crystal go!

1199
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:30,074
You know we're trying to
get it in the volcano, right?

1200
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:34,028
Manny, the only thing I want
is a life with Peaches.

1201
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:35,872
And to prove myself to you.

1202
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:38,879
So, okay, two things.
I want two things.

1203
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:42,077
Do you really think I'd waste
the only chance I have left?

1204
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:46,519
Ok, let's do it!

1205
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:48,870
On my count. One...

1206
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:50,040
Two...

1207
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:51,538
Three!

1208
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:04,891
What are they doing?

1209
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:23,618
Did it work?

1210
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:33,915
Yes! I take back everything
I ever said about you!

1211
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:35,832
Wait, what?

1212
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,079
Now let's get out of here!

1213
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,115
What happened?

1214
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:07,440
Maybe it's the quiet before the crazy?

1215
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:37,360
Eddie!

1216
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:04,120
We did it.

1217
01:16:04,283 --> 01:16:05,433
We did it!

1218
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:11,492
In your face, space rock!

1219
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:12,810
Yeah, baby!

1220
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:20,757
Not on the lips, geezer!

1221
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:23,336
<i>Hit the road, you stupid rock</i>

1222
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:24,998
<i>We just stopped the doomsday clock!</i>

1223
01:16:26,240 --> 01:16:28,754
Yes! Yeah!
All right!

1224
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:31,672
Bring it in, Bro-Son.
Welcome to the family.

1225
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:38,490
And you, you coconut!

1226
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:40,651
I'll never doubt you again.

1227
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:43,195
See? Daddy's always right.

1228
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:44,992
Remember that when you're older.

1229
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:53,392
Are you sure
you can't come with us?

1230
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:56,279
Oh, Sidney, I wish I could.

1231
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:58,910
But we both know this is for the best.

1232
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:01,509
You've got your whole life in front of you.

1233
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:04,558
Besides, I'll have Granny
to keep me company.

1234
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:06,451
You're staying, too?

1235
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:09,612
Are you kidding?
This place is great!

1236
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:13,429
Tonight's the big talent show,
and tomorrow, naked bingo!

1237
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:14,755
You coming, Gladys?

1238
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,172
I ain't getting any younger!

1239
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:18,236
What? I can't hear you!

1240
01:17:18,260 --> 01:17:19,899
What? I can't hear you!

1241
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:22,350
What? I can't hear you!
What?

1242
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:25,279
You'll always be my one true love.

1243
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:27,151
Here.

1244
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:31,280
Hold on.

1245
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:38,071
It looks just like you.

1246
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:40,276
Now we'll be with each other forever.

1247
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:46,759
So long, handsome!

1248
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:48,234
Bye, Sidney!

1249
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,319
What you need is more fiber.

1250
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:04,589
He's right.

1251
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:16,473
Shangri Llama's back on top, baby!

1252
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Gladys?

1253
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:27,679
Well, hello Teddy Bear!

1254
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,934
Hot tubbin' just got a whole lot hotter.

1255
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:37,112
Amazing!
It's like some kind of

1256
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:39,170
Fountain of Never Getting Old!

1257
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,991
Well, we can workshop the name later.

1258
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:58,420
Where's the bride?
Why don't I have the bride?

1259
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:00,357
'Cause you're talking into a twig.

1260
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:01,696
Mom, I can't talk.
I'm at a wedding.

1261
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:02,816
<i>What do you mean you can't talk?</i>

1262
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:03,840
<i>Who are you with?</i>

1263
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:05,352
Excuse me.

1264
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:08,871
Is it true you helped save
the world from an asteroid?

1265
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:13,035
That's a very scary story.

1266
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:14,474
You think you can handle it?

1267
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:15,693
Yeah.

1268
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:17,229
How scary?

1269
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:18,720
Well, we were...

1270
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:19,974
Hi!

1271
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:21,560
It was five minutes to midnight,

1272
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:23,551
and we were up against volcanoes,

1273
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:25,557
dino-birds, and the end of the world.

1274
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:27,988
Oh, and the zombies!
Don't forget the zombies!

1275
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:30,868
You know, we'd be great parents.

1276
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:33,120
So I turn to Bigfoot, and I say,

1277
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:34,394
Listen, big guy...

1278
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:38,393
I don't know. I don't know!
What am I gonna do?

1279
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:41,870
Sweetie, listen to me.
This is normal, okay?

1280
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:43,229
Everyone gets nervous.

1281
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:44,600
What's going on?
What happened?

1282
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:45,680
It's just...

1283
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:48,957
I can't go. How can I go?

1284
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:50,917
I don't wanna leave you guys.

1285
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:56,757
Hey, Fuzzball...

1286
01:19:57,760 --> 01:19:59,910
remember the first time
that we played hockey?

1287
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:03,074
You were so afraid to get on the ice
because it was slippery?

1288
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:07,114
Remember how I held you up
while you started to skate?

1289
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:09,748
And when I knew you were ready,
I let you go.

1290
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:12,549
Dad.

1291
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:14,020
I know you're ready.

1292
01:20:14,145 --> 01:20:15,795
Now you have to let go.

1293
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:19,749
I always knew it would take someone
very special to match your spirit.

1294
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:21,237
And you found him.

1295
01:20:21,362 --> 01:20:22,778
Just like I did.

1296
01:20:23,020 --> 01:20:24,517
It's your time, sweetie.

1297
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:26,791
See the world, chase your dreams.

1298
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:29,756
And whenever you decide to come back,

1299
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:31,758
we'll be here, ok?

1300
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:43,192
Ok.

1301
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:22,994
Do you...

1302
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:24,160
I do.

1303
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:25,355
And do you...

1304
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:26,999
Most def.

1305
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:29,991
I now pronounce you...

1306
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:48,619
Sid!

1307
01:21:48,680 --> 01:21:49,874
Brooke!

1308
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:03,519
This is amazing!

1309
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:06,359
You're young again.
And somehow, I'm still single.

1310
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:08,988
I guess the universe was smiling on us.

1311
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:10,878
I have so many questions for you.

1312
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:13,031
What happened?
How'd you find me?

1313
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:14,519
Have you tried the shrimp?

1314
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:18,189
Close that pretty little mouth of yours
and just listen.

1315
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:22,709
This is dedicated to the sloth of my dreams.

1316
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:25,070

I never thought I'd say this,

1339
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:27,360
but you did a great job on the wedding.

1340
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:28,799
I owe you bigtime, pal.

1341
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:30,279
You sure do.

1342
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:32,078
Here's my bill.
What?

1343
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:33,992
Father of the bride pays for the wedding.

1344
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:35,599
It's a tradition I just invented.

1345
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:37,193
Wait a minute, this is ridiculous.

1346
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:38,793
Look what you're charging for flowers!

1347
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:40,075
Flowers ain't cheap.

1348
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:42,629
No! They're free!
We're in a forest!

1349
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:43,949
This bill is outrageous!

1350
01:23:54,680 --> 01:23:56,113
<font color="#ff8000"><i>Mars.</i></font>

1351
01:23:56,280 --> 01:23:57,793
<font color="#ff8000"><i>The Red Planet.</i></font>

1352
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:02,312
<font color="#ff8000"><i>Cold, dry, inhospitable to life.</i></font>

1353
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:05,313
But billions and billions of years ago...

1354
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:07,471
Mars looked like this.

1355
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:12,476
There were lakes, rivers, oceans,

1356
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:15,319
the perfect conditions for life to form.

1357
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:17,954
So, what happened?

1358
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:20,873
<font color="#ff8000"><i>Why was life unable to take hold?</i></font>

1359
01:24:25,720 --> 01:24:27,358
Where did the water go?

1360
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:31,519
We may never know.

1361
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:47,640
