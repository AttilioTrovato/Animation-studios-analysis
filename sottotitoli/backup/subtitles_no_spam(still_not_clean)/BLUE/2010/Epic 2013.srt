1
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:48,006
<i>Somebody told me once...</i>

2
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,967
<i>that if you stand still
in the forest long enough...</i>

3
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:53,845
<i>you'll see signs of a hidden struggle.</i>

4
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:57,682
<i>Raging between forces of life and decay.</i>

5
00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:02,312
<i>That the survival of the forest itself
depends on the outcome.</i>

6
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,982
<i>And that the good guys need
all the help they can get.</i>

7
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:10,111
<i>And that if you don't believe it,
take a close look.</i>

8
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,491
<i>And if you still don't, look closer.</i>

9
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,296
Need a lift?

10
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,006
I don't need your help!

11
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,966
You're running out of branch there, buddy.

12
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,843
Still don't need your help.

13
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,327
Why aren't you with your group?

14
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,870
What? I fly faster alone!

15
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:07,163
How do you not get this?

16
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,790
You're not the only one on this team,
you know.

17
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,583
So yell at one of them for a change.

18
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,629
You hear that?
What am I supposed to do with this kid?

19
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,047
You're right.

20
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:19,175
You've got your own problems.

21
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:25,765
You're a Leafman.
You know how important today is.

22
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,935
You know what? I'm thinking maybe
I'm just not cut out for this.

23
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,438
That's the problem. You are cut out for it.

24
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,440
But I'm tired of waiting for you to prove it.

25
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:36,776
Get a bird and get back to Moonhaven,
or you're done.

26
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,195
What, you're not going to help me now?

27
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,072
I just did.

28
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:43,616
That's cool!

29
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,744
I could probably just jump from here!

30
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,038
Just follow that last guy down!

31
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,712
Whoa! Incoming.

32
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,798
Bet they didn't have bugs like that
in the city.

33
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,925
Yeah. I miss it already.

34
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,385
She talks!

35
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,429
Something on your mind, kid?

36
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:06,556
What do you say to a total stranger?

37
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:09,392
Stranger?
You and I go back twenty minutes.

38
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:12,645
Not you... Larry.

39
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,314
I mean the person I'm visiting.

40
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:17,150
I'm leaving you out here
with someone you don't know?

41
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:21,321
It's okay, Lar. We weren't always strangers.

42
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:24,616
Maybe now things will be different.

43
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:48,848
That's not a house, that's termites
holding hands. No offense.

44
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,266
Don't worry, Lar. I'll be--

45
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,811
Call if you need a quick getaway, kid!

46
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:54,854
Fine.

47
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,213
Hello?

48
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:24,300
Anyone home?

49
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:36,688
Hello?

50
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:49,242
No, actually, you know what?
I should check this bee.

51
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,412
No, that's right there.

52
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:55,498
Do we have-- I had it we-- No, it's over here.

53
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,667
Okay. Yeah. Let's see.

54
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,920
Made of-- Gosh!

55
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:04,758
I don't know, polished acorn shell
and thin leather? Perhaps mouse hide.

56
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,092
Pardon me, excuse me, sorry.

57
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,845
Correction: not mouse hide.
Shrew, perhaps.

58
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:12,057
Or, you know what,
actually, it could be vole.

59
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:13,516
Hi, Dad.

60
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:16,853
Mary Katherine!

61
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,063
Yeah.

62
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:20,106
You're here!

63
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:21,566
Yeah.

64
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:23,943
I didn't realize today was today.

65
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,613
It always is.

66
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:28,740
Hey, let me look at you!

67
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:32,786
You look just like your mother.
Like she did.

68
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:36,122
-You would, if you know what I mean...
-Dad.

69
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,083
Do you want to talk about it, if that's--

70
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:41,920
Thanks, but I've been reading up
on the five stages of grief.

71
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:43,922
I'm working through them myself.

72
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,466
I'm good like that.

73
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:49,636
There actually are a few things
I would like to talk about.

74
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:52,097
Ozzy!

75
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,766
Look who's back!

76
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:57,811
Ozzy? He's still alive?

77
00:07:58,103 --> 00:07:59,604
Well, you know, most of him.

78
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:01,731
He may be down to three legs,
but he'll make a break for it...

79
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,441
the first chance he gets.

80
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:07,112
Ozzy, go say hi.

81
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:08,780
Here, boy!

82
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:10,448
There he goes.

83
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,325
His depth perception's a little off...

84
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,744
and he has a tendency to run in circles.

85
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,663
Hey, but that was closer
than usual, you know?

86
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:19,124
He remembers you!

87
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:25,255
So, I have a little surprise for you up here.

88
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:27,340
Just follow me, take a look.

89
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:31,219
Ozzy! No. No kisses.

90
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:33,304
Well, here we are.

91
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:35,306
Welcome home.

92
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:39,352
It's like I never left.

93
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,731
All your things are here,
you got your dolls and...

94
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:45,275
your pictures, your turtle.

95
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,068
Oh, dear.

96
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:50,989
It's good to have you back, Mary Katherine.

97
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,159
Actually, I go by MK now.

98
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:55,910
Oh! MK.

99
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:59,247
I like that. It's more grown-up.

100
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,751
Do you have to get that?

101
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:05,754
No. That was just one of my sensors.

102
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,505
I got a lot going on right now.

103
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,632
Today is actually a highly unusual day.

104
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,135
There is both a full moon tonight
and the summer solstice...

105
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:14,804
which only coincide
every hundred years or so.

106
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,015
You can imagine, it's just crazy over here.

107
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:21,394
You probably want some time to settle in.

108
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,439
I'm just going to let you
make yourself at home, Mary Kather--

109
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:28,026
No, who's Mary Katherine? MK, I mean.

110
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,163
Okay, Mom, I'm trying.

111
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,707
That was the deal.

112
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:58,723
Oh my.

113
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:36,136
Oh!

114
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:40,682
Come on, Mom, you're going to miss them.

115
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:46,646
Hey, Leafmen!

116
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,982
What?

117
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:23,016
Queen Tara, we need to discuss
today's ceremony.

118
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,060
The Boggans have crossed
our border again.

119
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:27,520
You're not getting enough sunshine.

120
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,690
Yes, it's Ronin.

121
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:34,611
I think he looks silly kneeling, too,
but I can't get him to stop doing it.

122
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:36,863
I think the Boggans
are scouting our defenses.

123
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,699
You know they'd do anything to stop you
from choosing an heir.

124
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,785
But don't worry, I've got a plan.

125
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,995
When we were kids he wasn't so serious.

126
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,039
Would you like to hear my plan?

127
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,333
And he had the sweetest smile.

128
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,378
Look, instead of a public ceremony,
I go in with a small platoon...

129
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,547
pretend we're stopping for a drink.
We grab a pod, bring it back to you.

130
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:58,593
It blooms, the life of the forest continues.
We're in, we're out.

131
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,679
It doesn't work that way.

132
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,056
I can't choose unless I'm there.

133
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,558
It's about the feeling.

134
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,560
I get it from the pods...

135
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,688
I get it from the forest...

136
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,773
I get it from all of us.

137
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,026
There we are.

138
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:17,737
Don't you have feelings, Ronin?

139
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:20,281
Yes, I feel this is a bad idea.

140
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:23,201
The Boggans have never
been this aggressive.

141
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:25,620
I'm not completely helpless, you know.

142
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:27,747
I am aware.

143
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:29,708
But you're the life of the forest.

144
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:32,544
Looking after you is my duty.

145
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:35,046
Is that the only reason you do it?

146
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:36,756
Isn't that reason enough?

147
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:39,426
If that's the only reason there is.

148
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:40,593
Your Majesty.

149
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,262
Yes?

150
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:45,390
I'm not ticklish.

151
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:48,268
You used to be!

152
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:51,938
Very well. I understand your concern...

153
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:55,400
but this is the one day
in a hundred years I can choose an heir.

154
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:57,193
If I don't do this today...

155
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,196
there won't be a future to protect.

156
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,893
I don't think I saw a salute, Boggan!

157
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:47,994
We had a little skirmish
with some Leafmen this morning.

158
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,163
A rat got caught in the crossfire...

159
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,291
so I got a new coat.

160
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,169
It's, uh, just like yours!

161
00:13:56,836 --> 00:14:00,674
Did you find the location
of their ceremony?

162
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,385
Yes, sir!

163
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,845
It's way outside of our borders.

164
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:08,306
You mean their borders?

165
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:11,226
The Leafmen think
they can keep us contained...

166
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:14,396
surround our beautiful island of rot...

167
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:17,023
with their hideous green forest.

168
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,192
So arrogant!

169
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:23,154
All in the name of balance.
I'm sick of balance.

170
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:26,408
No matter how much of the forest
we destroy...

171
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:30,203
the queen regrows it
with one wave of her hand.

172
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,581
She needs to be cut down! At the root!

173
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:36,543
Exactly.

174
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:42,257
Today we'll show them
you just can't stop the rot.

175
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,886
If the queen dies without an heir...

176
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,265
the Leafmen can't regrow anything.

177
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:53,101
The balance swings in our favor forever.

178
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:55,353
Leaving you and me...

179
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:59,899
rulers of a desperate, desiccated kingdom.

180
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,693
I won't let you down...

181
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,237
Dad.

182
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:05,905
I know you won't.

183
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:12,454
You look good in rat. It's slimming.

184
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:17,625
Yeah!

185
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:21,087
Look out, look out!

186
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,089
Here comes your star pupil.

187
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:30,096
Where have you been?

188
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:31,556
Wait, you're mad?

189
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:34,601
You told me to get back
and I'm back. On this!

190
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,604
And you want credit for that? You're late.

191
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:39,939
Find a real bird and get back to your group.

192
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:42,609
You know what? No.

193
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:44,069
What did you say?

194
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:45,278
I'm not doing it.

195
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,822
I'm not a kid anymore
and I'm tired of you treating me like one.

196
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:50,617
I'm trying to help you,
I'm trying to look out for you.

197
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:52,327
I never asked you to do that.

198
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:53,912
Your father did.

199
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:56,623
Well, you can stop.

200
00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:00,293
I absolve you of all further responsibility
in the raising of young Nod.

201
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,171
Don't walk away from me.
I'm your commanding officer!

202
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:04,839
Not anymore!

203
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,342
I quit!

204
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:10,470
Thatta girl. Easy, easy!

205
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:13,682
What are you looking at?

206
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:15,850
Nothing. I have no opinion on this.

207
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:17,477
Everyone, mount up!

208
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:42,669
Parade! Fun! Smiling!

209
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:52,637
Dad!

210
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:54,305
Dad!

211
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:58,518
Is this a good time to talk?

212
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:01,938
Hold on, I'll be right down!

213
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:06,693
Ozzy!

214
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:07,819
Ozzy, stop!

215
00:17:08,153 --> 00:17:09,779
Fetch the camera!

216
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:14,617
Why do you have
security cameras, anyway?

217
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:18,038
Do people around here
steal old newspapers?

218
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,540
No, no. They're not security cameras.

219
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:24,544
No, I have an extensive network
all through the forest, yeah.

220
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:28,214
I don't know how much
your mother told you about my work.

221
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,550
Um... nothing.

222
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:32,761
Just that you have a delusional belief...

223
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:37,057
in an advanced society
of tiny people living in the woods...

224
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,309
and it ruined your career...

225
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:42,145
not to mention your marriage.

226
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:44,564
Or something?

227
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:46,399
Well...

228
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,985
your mother had a wonderful
sense of humor.

229
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:51,071
But I'm not delusional.
I know they're out there.

230
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,782
It's intuition,
like scientists intuited the atom.

231
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:55,784
These little guys
are a big part of the ecosystem...

232
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:59,162
the engine, if you will,
and I will prove it. Here.

233
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:04,000
You have bat sounds on your iPod? Why?

234
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:07,462
To study them.
They don't really fly in your hair.

235
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:09,005
That's a myth.

236
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:10,757
But I was trying to identify...

237
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:14,594
the frequencies that draw bats
to gather with their own kind.

238
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:16,638
So I slowed the sounds down...

239
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:19,265
and I put them through
some proprietary filters...

240
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:20,600
and guess what I heard.

241
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:22,686
Voices?

242
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:23,853
Yes!

243
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:39,494
Isn't that cool?

244
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:40,495
Okay...

245
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:43,790
if tiny men are flying around in the forest...

246
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:45,291
how come I've never seen them?

247
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,460
No, that's easy.

248
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:49,087
It's the same reason we can't hear them.

249
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:51,589
They just move too fast, like insects.

250
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:54,467
Didn't you ever wonder
why it was so hard to swat a fly?

251
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:57,637
My theory is they're actually living faster.

252
00:18:57,804 --> 00:19:00,015
Like in a different dimension.

253
00:19:01,016 --> 00:19:02,809
So, no matter how fast we think we are...

254
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:04,811
to them we're just big and dumb and...

255
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:07,605
slow.

256
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:09,983
Have you ever seen one?

257
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:12,110
Well, you know, uh...

258
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:14,112
You know what? Just because
you haven't seen something...

259
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:15,447
doesn't mean it's not there.

260
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:17,782
I, you know, that's...

261
00:19:17,949 --> 00:19:18,950
Come on.

262
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:22,328
Okay, we need to talk.

263
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,872
I know it's a lot to take in.

264
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:25,707
I mean about us.

265
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:28,501
No, we'll do it together!

266
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:31,713
Yeah, both of us. Here, I made this for you.

267
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:35,175
Dad, look...

268
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:37,177
I am almost old enough
to be on my own anyway...

269
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:40,680
so I think it would be better if I just...

270
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:44,851
You don't want to live here?
That's what you want?

271
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:46,811
No, it's not what I want.

272
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:49,856
I want you to stop! All this!

273
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:53,401
And be normal.
I just, I want a dad who's not--

274
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:58,490
Oh, um, okay. This is big.

275
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:01,034
This is a big thing going on right now.
Let me just find--

276
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:02,035
Where are you going?

277
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:03,828
I'm just going to investigate, rather--

278
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:06,831
Okay, something must be happening.

279
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,833
Let's see. Where's my camera?

280
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:10,126
Are you serious?

281
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,961
You have to catch these things
in the moment...

282
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:13,046
while they're happening...

283
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:15,674
otherwise you miss a chance
that could be gone forever.

284
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,968
You're missing a chance right now!
Are you even listening?

285
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:21,221
Look, you've got to believe me.
I am so close.

286
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:23,515
All I need is one little breakthrough.
This could be it!

287
00:20:23,682 --> 00:20:26,559
I will clear this all up when I get back!

288
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:28,353
I promise!

289
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:30,230
Sure, Dad.

290
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,523
I'll be here.

291
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:34,567
In reality.

292
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,412
Bye, Ozzy.

293
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:46,996
It's not you.

294
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:51,418
Larry? I need that getaway cab.

295
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:54,754
I said, pick me up by the-- Hello?

296
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,589
No bars!

297
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:58,717
Ozzy! Heel!

298
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:01,344
Stop! Play dead!

299
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:03,888
How are you so fast on three legs?

300
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:05,932
Ozzy!

301
00:21:06,725 --> 00:21:08,018
Ozzy!

302
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:10,270
Ozzy!

303
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:07,035
Isn't she pretty?

304
00:22:07,202 --> 00:22:08,995
She's awesome!

305
00:22:09,162 --> 00:22:12,457
She moved those trees with her mind!

306
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:14,959
Mom, can I be queen when I grow up?

307
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:19,130
Honey, it doesn't work that way.

308
00:22:19,297 --> 00:22:23,510
Today, Queen Tara gives her power
to a special Pod...

309
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:26,429
so the life of the forest will continue.

310
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:29,766
It's all very mysterious, and--

311
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:32,852
Sweetie, what are you doing?

312
00:22:33,645 --> 00:22:34,979
Mom! I did it!

313
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:36,856
Did what?

314
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:41,361
She's coming!

315
00:22:41,528 --> 00:22:42,862
Don't do anything to embarrass me...

316
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:44,906
or it could ruin my chances
of being a Leafman.

317
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:46,408
Why do you want to be a Leafman?

318
00:22:46,574 --> 00:22:47,826
They gotta wear uniforms.

319
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:51,746
Me? I like to let it all hang free.

320
00:22:51,913 --> 00:22:53,998
You see this, you see that?

321
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:56,584
Yeah, don't do that. That's vile.

322
00:22:56,751 --> 00:22:59,462
Come on, I know you got a little belly, too.

323
00:23:01,631 --> 00:23:02,632
Gentlemen.

324
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,635
Hey. Your Majesty. Hello.

325
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:08,471
It's all right. Relax, it's just me.

326
00:23:08,638 --> 00:23:12,600
Mub, Grub,
it's a very nice-looking group of Pods.

327
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:16,104
I might have a hard time picking one.
Do you have a favorite?

328
00:23:16,271 --> 00:23:18,982
Your Majesty,
we have had quite the debate.

329
00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:20,400
Really gone back and forth.

330
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:24,279
You'll note the carefully curated
selection of sizes, densities, color.

331
00:23:24,446 --> 00:23:26,740
With so many variables,
you can't be too hasty.

332
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:28,658
Boom! Right here.

333
00:23:28,825 --> 00:23:30,702
Biggest in the bunch.

334
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,664
Well, that's one way to go.

335
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:37,459
How about that one?

336
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:40,920
What? That one?

337
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:42,630
For real? But it's so--

338
00:23:42,797 --> 00:23:44,382
Perfect! It's perfect.

339
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:47,177
Excellent choice, Your Majesty.

340
00:23:47,344 --> 00:23:50,472
Sometimes the biggest one
isn't the best one.

341
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:55,143
I told you, she doesn't like gaudy, Mub.
Unlike you, she's got class.

342
00:23:57,812 --> 00:23:59,773
This is it.

343
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:01,274
This is the one.

344
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:22,837
Boggans.

345
00:24:42,816 --> 00:24:45,360
Your Majesty! Get to the barge!

346
00:25:06,506 --> 00:25:08,341
I told you she was awesome!

347
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,469
Hold the formation!

348
00:25:13,847 --> 00:25:16,641
This is it, Mub! My chance to be a Leaf--

349
00:25:18,643 --> 00:25:20,895
What? Your chance to be a what?

350
00:25:35,076 --> 00:25:35,869
Ronin!

351
00:26:28,922 --> 00:26:30,382
Ozzy?

352
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:33,009
Oh, come on, Ozzy.

353
00:26:39,933 --> 00:26:43,019
We had numbers,
and we had the surprise part!

354
00:26:43,186 --> 00:26:44,187
How are we losing?

355
00:26:44,396 --> 00:26:47,941
Patience, son.
The forest wasn't grown in a day.

356
00:26:48,108 --> 00:26:51,569
But we can destroy it in one. Right?

357
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,905
That's the spirit!

358
00:26:54,072 --> 00:26:56,533
You take the Pod, I'll take the queen.

359
00:27:12,924 --> 00:27:13,967
Nice one!

360
00:27:14,134 --> 00:27:15,927
You're stealing my moves, kid!

361
00:27:16,094 --> 00:27:17,387
Your Majesty, come with me!

362
00:27:17,554 --> 00:27:18,596
Take her to safety!

363
00:27:18,763 --> 00:27:20,640
I have to lead them away from the crowd!

364
00:27:20,807 --> 00:27:22,308
You're totally my hero!

365
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,663
Okay...

366
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,457
so maybe you were right.

367
00:27:45,623 --> 00:27:47,333
Remind me to gloat later.

368
00:28:02,557 --> 00:28:06,102
Son! No!

369
00:28:19,157 --> 00:28:20,867
Ozzy!

370
00:29:38,236 --> 00:29:39,612
Are you okay?

371
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:41,114
Are you all right?

372
00:29:42,032 --> 00:29:43,450
Oh, my gosh, that's an arrow.

373
00:29:44,743 --> 00:29:48,079
Should I pull it out?
I don't know what to do.

374
00:29:48,246 --> 00:29:51,291
Take the Pod to Nim Galuu.

375
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:54,127
Nim what? You need a doctor.

376
00:29:54,294 --> 00:29:55,462
Somebody call--

377
00:29:55,628 --> 00:29:57,797
What is this thing?

378
00:29:58,882 --> 00:30:01,217
It's the life of the forest.

379
00:30:13,146 --> 00:30:14,105
Tara!

380
00:30:26,826 --> 00:30:28,828
So serious.

381
00:31:32,392 --> 00:31:33,977
I'm so sorry.

382
00:31:35,478 --> 00:31:37,188
What did she say to you?

383
00:31:37,355 --> 00:31:41,234
Something about glue? Or a canoe.

384
00:31:41,401 --> 00:31:42,569
Nim Galuu.

385
00:31:42,736 --> 00:31:44,446
The scroll keeper.

386
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:48,408
We don't know anything
about the Pod without Tara.

387
00:31:48,575 --> 00:31:50,410
Maybe he does.

388
00:31:50,577 --> 00:31:52,203
Take the Leafmen to Moonhaven.

389
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:55,123
Fortify it. Keep everyone safe.

390
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:56,332
What about you?

391
00:31:57,917 --> 00:32:00,003
Mandrake will be looking for this Pod...

392
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:02,464
but he won't be looking
for a Leafman traveling alone.

393
00:32:02,672 --> 00:32:04,215
That's not what I meant.

394
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,635
I know what you meant.

395
00:32:08,261 --> 00:32:10,138
I'll send word when I reach Nim's.

396
00:32:10,722 --> 00:32:14,934
Who are you people?
Is this some sort of reenactment?

397
00:32:16,895 --> 00:32:18,313
That's a big bug.

398
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,523
No, it's about average, actually.

399
00:32:22,442 --> 00:32:25,278
Then what? I'm tiny?

400
00:32:29,074 --> 00:32:30,075
Oh, no.

401
00:32:30,867 --> 00:32:32,243
No.

402
00:32:36,706 --> 00:32:38,458
No, no, no.

403
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:41,294
I'm not sure why the queen
brought you here either...

404
00:32:41,461 --> 00:32:43,880
but she gave you that Pod,
so you have to come with me.

405
00:32:44,047 --> 00:32:45,465
-Make me big!
-Excuse me?

406
00:32:45,632 --> 00:32:48,009
I'm not going anywhere
until you make me big again!

407
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,345
You know what? I don't do magic.

408
00:32:50,512 --> 00:32:52,430
You can talk to Nim Galuu about that,
he might know something.

409
00:32:52,597 --> 00:32:53,473
Might?

410
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,601
Whoa! Not so fast, soldier boy.

411
00:32:56,768 --> 00:32:59,521
You do not yank on a Pod, okay?

412
00:32:59,688 --> 00:33:03,817
Especially when it's attached
to something so lovely.

413
00:33:03,983 --> 00:33:05,235
Talking snails.

414
00:33:05,402 --> 00:33:07,404
Actually, he's a snail.

415
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:10,323
I'm a slug. No shell over here, baby.

416
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:12,200
It just slows me down.

417
00:33:12,367 --> 00:33:15,078
Ronin, right? Head of the Leafmen?

418
00:33:15,245 --> 00:33:16,496
Big fan.

419
00:33:16,663 --> 00:33:18,998
I just love what you do with your jaw.

420
00:33:19,874 --> 00:33:21,334
Yes, that!

421
00:33:21,751 --> 00:33:24,045
We are the official Pod caretakers, sir.

422
00:33:24,212 --> 00:33:26,506
It can't survive without us.

423
00:33:26,673 --> 00:33:28,049
We keep it moist.

424
00:33:28,216 --> 00:33:31,428
Moist is what we do.

425
00:33:31,594 --> 00:33:33,346
You're kidding.

426
00:33:34,264 --> 00:33:36,391
You're not kidding. Fine.

427
00:33:37,017 --> 00:33:39,894
Word of the queen's passing
will travel fast...

428
00:33:40,353 --> 00:33:41,688
we have to travel faster.

429
00:33:42,188 --> 00:33:44,941
With all this extra weight
we're going to need another bird.

430
00:33:45,108 --> 00:33:47,610
Bird. Of course.

431
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,700
By any chance...

432
00:33:53,867 --> 00:33:56,286
you don't happen to be part of
an advanced society...

433
00:33:56,453 --> 00:33:59,706
of tiny people living in the woods, do you?

434
00:34:03,543 --> 00:34:06,379
Some are more advanced than others.

435
00:34:14,095 --> 00:34:16,431
<i>And that's another lap down.
These racers are in it to win...</i>

436
00:34:16,598 --> 00:34:19,392
<i>and they'd better be, we've got some
heavy betting in the crowd today.</i>

437
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:21,061
<i>They're clustering together--</i>

438
00:34:21,227 --> 00:34:24,189
I'm telling you, this is where I belong!

439
00:34:24,356 --> 00:34:26,191
You belong in the back of the pack!

440
00:34:26,358 --> 00:34:28,360
I mean racing! The best man wins.

441
00:34:28,526 --> 00:34:30,362
No other rules,
nobody telling you what to do.

442
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:31,571
You talk too much!

443
00:34:31,738 --> 00:34:33,615
And you ain't winning this race!

444
00:34:33,782 --> 00:34:36,201
Sorry, can't hear you! Going too fast!

445
00:34:40,705 --> 00:34:43,416
Hey. Nice old fleabag you got there.

446
00:34:43,583 --> 00:34:45,877
It's not the bird, it's how you ride it.

447
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,587
Yeah? Prove it.

448
00:34:47,754 --> 00:34:48,797
Fetch!

449
00:34:49,589 --> 00:34:52,967
<i>That's a dirty trick, which, let's face it,
is exactly what we've come to see.</i>

450
00:34:53,134 --> 00:34:54,594
Final lap!

451
00:34:54,761 --> 00:34:56,721
<i>This is bird racing, folks, it's not a parade.</i>

452
00:34:56,888 --> 00:34:58,598
<i>Looks like Nod's out of the race.</i>

453
00:35:06,064 --> 00:35:07,148
<i>Wait a minute, is that--</i>

454
00:35:07,315 --> 00:35:08,900
<i>Nod is down but not out!</i>

455
00:35:09,067 --> 00:35:10,735
<i>Don't let his old bird fool you!</i>

456
00:35:10,944 --> 00:35:12,445
<i>The kid's on the comeback trail!</i>

457
00:35:12,612 --> 00:35:14,447
You know what we'll do if you win?

458
00:35:15,448 --> 00:35:17,117
I don't know, lose?

459
00:35:17,283 --> 00:35:19,744
<i>It's the final lap.
They're beak to beak, wing to wing...</i>

460
00:35:19,911 --> 00:35:22,747
<i>and it's Nod by a tail feather!</i>

461
00:35:22,914 --> 00:35:24,249
<i>The odds-on favorite takes it home.</i>

462
00:35:24,457 --> 00:35:27,460
<i>I bet there's a lot of happy faces
in the crowd right now.</i>

463
00:35:29,796 --> 00:35:31,631
Is that the best you've got?

464
00:35:32,257 --> 00:35:33,633
How was that?

465
00:35:33,925 --> 00:35:34,759
Better.

466
00:35:34,926 --> 00:35:37,303
Nod, you know I like you.

467
00:35:37,929 --> 00:35:39,806
Yeah, I like you, too, Mr. Bufo.

468
00:35:39,973 --> 00:35:42,684
And yet, you don't do what we agreed.

469
00:35:43,351 --> 00:35:46,980
We agreed that you would lose,
but then you win.

470
00:35:47,147 --> 00:35:48,815
Now, I can't help it if I'm fast.

471
00:35:48,982 --> 00:35:50,817
You want me to lose, you gotta give me
some better competition.

472
00:35:50,984 --> 00:35:52,652
It's called teamwork.

473
00:35:52,819 --> 00:35:54,320
Maybe if you understood that...

474
00:35:54,487 --> 00:35:56,281
the Leafmen wouldn't have kicked you out.

475
00:35:56,448 --> 00:35:58,658
They did not kick me out. I quit.

476
00:35:59,659 --> 00:36:03,246
I admire your independent spirit, Nod,
I'll miss that.

477
00:36:03,955 --> 00:36:06,416
Feed him to something.
A snake would be good.

478
00:36:06,833 --> 00:36:09,419
No, snakes just swallow you whole.

479
00:36:09,586 --> 00:36:12,922
Now, if you put him in a hornets' nest,
that's a show.

480
00:36:13,089 --> 00:36:15,592
Look, it's Ronin, defender of the weak...

481
00:36:15,759 --> 00:36:18,803
pooper of parties, here to ruin the fun.

482
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:20,805
I didn't ruin all of it. I let you hit him.

483
00:36:21,348 --> 00:36:22,307
Twice.

484
00:36:22,474 --> 00:36:24,184
Hop along now, little froggy.

485
00:36:24,351 --> 00:36:26,853
Easy, Ronin, it's a big forest out there.

486
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:29,022
Even Leafmen gotta sleep.

487
00:36:29,314 --> 00:36:31,524
You're wasting your time.
I'm not coming back.

488
00:36:31,691 --> 00:36:32,776
I'm not asking.

489
00:36:32,942 --> 00:36:35,278
I see. The old reverse psychology.

490
00:36:35,445 --> 00:36:37,697
Make me feel guilty, get me to beg you.

491
00:36:37,864 --> 00:36:40,533
I didn't come for you. The queen is dead.

492
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,452
What? How?

493
00:36:42,786 --> 00:36:43,870
Boggan ambush.

494
00:36:44,037 --> 00:36:46,956
Ronin, I don't know what to say.

495
00:36:47,123 --> 00:36:48,875
She was your...

496
00:36:49,042 --> 00:36:50,543
I'm sorry.

497
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:53,463
What's going to happen to us,
to the forest?

498
00:36:53,797 --> 00:36:57,008
If we don't get the Pod to Nim Galuu's,
the forest will die.

499
00:36:58,051 --> 00:36:59,469
Let me grab my saddle.

500
00:36:59,636 --> 00:37:02,180
What? No. I didn't ask for your help.

501
00:37:02,347 --> 00:37:04,891
Really? Because it sounds like
you could use a rider with my--

502
00:37:05,058 --> 00:37:06,685
Ability to absorb punches?

503
00:37:06,851 --> 00:37:09,354
The situation's desperate.
Let's not make it hopeless.

504
00:37:09,521 --> 00:37:12,524
All right, who's with you?
Who's riding point?

505
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,321
Uh-oh.

506
00:37:19,656 --> 00:37:21,908
-Get your saddle.
-I'll get my saddle.

507
00:37:26,121 --> 00:37:28,998
This doesn't make any--
I mean, it makes sense.

508
00:37:30,542 --> 00:37:32,502
Mary Katherine, you're not
gonna believe these readings...

509
00:37:32,669 --> 00:37:33,670
they are off the charts!

510
00:37:34,295 --> 00:37:36,047
The wind, and the rain and lightning!

511
00:37:36,214 --> 00:37:38,508
And the birds were flying! In a storm!

512
00:37:38,717 --> 00:37:40,385
Okay, and that's not normal.

513
00:37:40,552 --> 00:37:42,637
Which would prove--

514
00:37:42,846 --> 00:37:45,015
Actually, you know what?
I'm going to make some lunch...

515
00:37:45,181 --> 00:37:46,891
and I'll tell you all about it.

516
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,063
Ozzy, what are you doing outside?

517
00:37:53,106 --> 00:37:54,899
Did you see it, too? Tell me you saw it.

518
00:37:56,026 --> 00:37:59,654
Hey, Mary Katheri-- Or, no, MK!

519
00:37:59,821 --> 00:38:02,782
MK, what did you want to talk about?

520
00:38:04,325 --> 00:38:06,494
What? What is it, Ozzy?

521
00:38:23,511 --> 00:38:25,472
Hey, I'm Nod, by the way.

522
00:38:25,638 --> 00:38:27,974
Hi. MK. Yeah.

523
00:38:28,141 --> 00:38:30,977
Could you just face the way
the bird's driving?

524
00:38:31,144 --> 00:38:33,313
No, don't worry.
She practically flies herself.

525
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,316
Great, because this whole
bird-riding thing's new to me.

526
00:38:36,483 --> 00:38:39,944
Are you serious? We gotta fix that.
Here, put your arms around me.

527
00:38:40,111 --> 00:38:41,112
I just met you.

528
00:38:41,279 --> 00:38:43,656
Okay, but you're gonna
want to hold on to something.

529
00:38:47,494 --> 00:38:48,536
What is wrong with you?

530
00:38:48,703 --> 00:38:50,622
Do you know how hard it is
to do that without falling?

531
00:38:50,789 --> 00:38:51,498
I do now!

532
00:38:51,664 --> 00:38:53,458
Nod, perch your bird.

533
00:38:53,625 --> 00:38:55,835
Hey, I'm just trying
to keep things...

534
00:38:56,002 --> 00:38:57,170
light.

535
00:38:58,672 --> 00:39:00,048
What did that?

536
00:39:00,215 --> 00:39:01,633
Mandrake.

537
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,302
Tara's power always kept him in check.

538
00:39:04,469 --> 00:39:07,347
Now nothing can heal what he destroys.

539
00:39:07,722 --> 00:39:09,140
Except that Pod.

540
00:39:11,976 --> 00:39:13,311
We have to go around.

541
00:39:13,478 --> 00:39:15,021
Just for one scout?

542
00:39:15,188 --> 00:39:16,856
Ever see just one Boggan?

543
00:39:19,651 --> 00:39:21,778
-Hold on to me.
-Still barely know you.

544
00:39:21,945 --> 00:39:23,154
Nod, wait!

545
00:39:24,989 --> 00:39:26,032
Whoa!

546
00:39:26,282 --> 00:39:28,284
Get to the ground!

547
00:39:37,794 --> 00:39:38,712
This way!

548
00:39:43,049 --> 00:39:44,676
Other way!

549
00:39:51,391 --> 00:39:52,684
What was that thing?

550
00:39:52,851 --> 00:39:54,644
What, you've never seen a Boggan?

551
00:39:54,811 --> 00:39:57,022
Someone had a happy childhood.

552
00:39:57,188 --> 00:39:59,232
Come on, let's regroup.

553
00:39:59,983 --> 00:40:02,027
You mean up there with those things?

554
00:40:02,193 --> 00:40:03,653
They almost killed us.

555
00:40:04,821 --> 00:40:07,198
Don't turn around.

556
00:40:08,074 --> 00:40:09,242
Is it a Boogie?

557
00:40:09,409 --> 00:40:11,745
Walk towards me slowly.

558
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:24,424
Oh, it's a mouse.

559
00:40:24,591 --> 00:40:28,219
Hi, mousie!
I was gonna scare it away.

560
00:40:28,386 --> 00:40:29,763
What are you doing?

561
00:40:29,929 --> 00:40:33,099
Look at its little hands
and its little whiskers.

562
00:40:45,278 --> 00:40:46,780
Hello! Other person!

563
00:40:46,946 --> 00:40:48,782
-Jump!
-I can't jump that high!

564
00:40:55,955 --> 00:40:57,248
Did you see what I just did?

565
00:40:57,415 --> 00:40:59,209
Out! Jump out!

566
00:41:06,966 --> 00:41:08,635
Oh, great.

567
00:41:10,303 --> 00:41:12,931
Hey, over here! Over here!

568
00:41:19,062 --> 00:41:20,397
Whoa, whoa!

569
00:41:23,441 --> 00:41:25,318
Fuzzy mousie.

570
00:41:28,613 --> 00:41:31,324
Nice tail. It's flexible.

571
00:41:35,662 --> 00:41:36,663
Help!

572
00:41:43,003 --> 00:41:45,797
They have very sensitive whiskers.

573
00:41:45,964 --> 00:41:47,674
You know, I had this.

574
00:41:48,133 --> 00:41:49,134
Uh-huh.

575
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,427
Are you all right?

576
00:41:50,593 --> 00:41:53,972
Dad? I had the most messed-up dream.

577
00:41:54,139 --> 00:41:59,144
There were talking slugs
and tiny little soldiers and--

578
00:42:00,145 --> 00:42:01,271
Hello!

579
00:42:01,438 --> 00:42:03,189
Ah, man!

580
00:42:04,024 --> 00:42:05,525
Now let's move.

581
00:42:05,692 --> 00:42:09,112
Where there's mice
there's bound to be chipmunks.

582
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:12,407
New seating arrangement.

583
00:42:16,661 --> 00:42:17,954
You're riding with me.

584
00:42:18,121 --> 00:42:19,372
Thank you.

585
00:42:19,539 --> 00:42:20,832
You're with the slugs.

586
00:42:20,999 --> 00:42:22,375
Disgusting.

587
00:42:22,542 --> 00:42:25,712
Do you and me have a problem?

588
00:42:26,087 --> 00:42:27,964
I don't think so.

589
00:42:28,381 --> 00:42:29,632
What was that over there?

590
00:42:29,799 --> 00:42:32,010
A little chit-chat? That's real cute.

591
00:42:32,177 --> 00:42:33,428
You trying to jump in?

592
00:42:33,595 --> 00:42:34,804
What are we talking about?

593
00:42:34,971 --> 00:42:37,807
There's a code amongst men.

594
00:42:37,974 --> 00:42:39,934
It goes something like this.

595
00:42:40,101 --> 00:42:42,645
I saw her first.

596
00:42:45,106 --> 00:42:45,940
Ow!

597
00:42:46,358 --> 00:42:47,400
You're a slug.

598
00:42:47,567 --> 00:42:49,694
So? You think she'd want you?

599
00:42:49,861 --> 00:42:51,029
Look at yourself!

600
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:54,491
Oh, that's right, you can't...

601
00:42:54,657 --> 00:42:58,119
because your eyeballs are stuck
all the way inside your head.

602
00:42:58,286 --> 00:43:01,456
What's wrong, flatface?
Are you gonna cry?

603
00:43:01,623 --> 00:43:05,001
Do you want me to call
your flatface mommy?

604
00:43:05,669 --> 00:43:09,881
You know you're not insulting me, right?
You're just grossing me out.

605
00:43:10,048 --> 00:43:11,800
You've been warned.

606
00:43:12,801 --> 00:43:14,052
Ow!

607
00:43:36,783 --> 00:43:38,576
Hey, if this is a bad time...

608
00:43:38,743 --> 00:43:41,705
I can come back
when you're done gardening.

609
00:43:42,872 --> 00:43:43,957
Hey!

610
00:43:44,958 --> 00:43:48,503
I imagine you're wondering
why I invited you here.

611
00:43:49,004 --> 00:43:52,298
I was frog-marched here at spearpoint.

612
00:43:52,757 --> 00:43:54,342
How is that invited?

613
00:43:54,592 --> 00:43:56,386
I let you keep your legs.

614
00:43:56,886 --> 00:43:58,722
Comedy. Terrific.

615
00:43:58,888 --> 00:44:00,348
Funny psychopath.

616
00:44:00,515 --> 00:44:04,144
There are rumors that the Leafman Ronin
was at your place of business...

617
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:08,189
and that he may have rescued
a Royal Pod.

618
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:10,233
Real smooth.

619
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,820
You got rid of the queen,
but let her Pod get away.

620
00:44:13,987 --> 00:44:16,740
Plus your idiot general
gets himself mulched.

621
00:44:16,906 --> 00:44:19,117
That idiot general...

622
00:44:19,284 --> 00:44:21,494
was my son!

623
00:44:39,888 --> 00:44:41,931
Of course he was.
He had your good looks.

624
00:44:42,098 --> 00:44:44,851
And your healthy gray complexion.

625
00:44:45,018 --> 00:44:46,478
And forgiving nature.

626
00:44:46,644 --> 00:44:47,937
Shut up!

627
00:44:48,104 --> 00:44:50,190
What's it gonna be, Bufo?

628
00:44:50,357 --> 00:44:51,858
Are you gonna talk?

629
00:44:52,025 --> 00:44:53,735
Or are you gonna croak?

630
00:44:54,944 --> 00:44:57,864
Where are they taking the Pod?

631
00:45:11,544 --> 00:45:13,129
It's clear.

632
00:45:21,054 --> 00:45:23,556
Why is he even with us?
He's not helping.

633
00:45:23,723 --> 00:45:25,517
Well, when he's not being an idiot...

634
00:45:25,684 --> 00:45:27,477
he's a pretty decent flier.

635
00:45:27,977 --> 00:45:29,479
Could be one of the best.

636
00:45:29,646 --> 00:45:33,441
Plus his father was my friend,
so I do what I can.

637
00:45:33,608 --> 00:45:35,610
"Many leaves, one tree."

638
00:45:35,777 --> 00:45:37,070
What does that mean?

639
00:45:37,779 --> 00:45:41,282
We're all individuals,
but we're still connected.

640
00:45:41,449 --> 00:45:43,076
It's what we live by.

641
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:48,456
Maybe you're connected,
but I'm kind of on my own.

642
00:45:48,623 --> 00:45:49,624
No one's on their own.

643
00:45:51,918 --> 00:45:53,336
Not even him.

644
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:58,091
Hey, Nod, how's the view?

645
00:46:21,573 --> 00:46:22,449
Well...

646
00:46:22,615 --> 00:46:23,533
here we are.

647
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:26,453
I thought this was a secret
Leafmen mission.

648
00:46:26,619 --> 00:46:28,663
How many people
did the queen tell about this?

649
00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:30,040
They're here looking for answers.

650
00:46:30,206 --> 00:46:31,875
Nobody knows that the queen is gone...

651
00:46:32,042 --> 00:46:33,877
only that the blight is spreading.

652
00:46:34,044 --> 00:46:35,837
So, this Nim guy can tell them?

653
00:46:36,004 --> 00:46:37,255
He's the keeper of our history...

654
00:46:37,422 --> 00:46:39,132
but even he may not know
about the queen.

655
00:46:39,299 --> 00:46:40,884
He's not always up to speed.

656
00:46:41,051 --> 00:46:42,427
But he'll help, right?

657
00:46:42,594 --> 00:46:44,721
He's, like, the wise old man of the forest.

658
00:46:44,888 --> 00:46:47,015
He's more like the crazy uncle.

659
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,185
The whole meadow just died.

660
00:46:50,352 --> 00:46:53,104
Everything was green, and now it's gone.

661
00:46:53,271 --> 00:46:54,981
I grew up in that meadow.

662
00:46:55,148 --> 00:46:56,733
Why isn't the queen doing anything?

663
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:59,152
If anything happened to her,
everything's going to rot!

664
00:46:59,319 --> 00:47:01,363
We're doomed! We're doomed!

665
00:47:01,529 --> 00:47:03,031
Get a hold of yourself!

666
00:47:03,198 --> 00:47:04,574
Oops. Sorry.

667
00:47:05,325 --> 00:47:06,701
Friends!

668
00:47:07,535 --> 00:47:09,329
Neighbors!

669
00:47:12,165 --> 00:47:14,417
Prepare to see your worries...

670
00:47:15,168 --> 00:47:16,920
disappear.

671
00:47:18,546 --> 00:47:20,715
I know rumors have been flying...

672
00:47:21,758 --> 00:47:25,136
but the truth is never as bad
as it seems.

673
00:47:25,303 --> 00:47:29,307
I have just returned
from deep inside this tree...

674
00:47:29,474 --> 00:47:32,268
from the Rings of Knowledge...

675
00:47:33,978 --> 00:47:35,313
where every memory...

676
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:37,607
every event that ever happens
in the forest...

677
00:47:38,149 --> 00:47:41,277
is recorded in these scrolls.

678
00:47:42,529 --> 00:47:45,365
<i>Listen, party poopers,
I've got something to say</i>

679
00:47:45,532 --> 00:47:47,951
<i>Dry your weeping eyes,
we're gonna be okay</i>

680
00:47:48,284 --> 00:47:51,162
<i>So you don't have to worry
about a dog gone thing</i>

681
00:47:51,371 --> 00:47:54,124
<i>The Rings of Knowledge know everything</i>

682
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:57,043
<i>The scrolls never lie and, honey,
neither does Nim</i>

683
00:47:57,210 --> 00:48:00,213
<i>It's right here in my hands,
all six of them</i>

684
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:02,757
<i>So tuck your little fears
and put them right into bed</i>

685
00:48:03,174 --> 00:48:05,051
<i>It says right here that the queen--</i>

686
00:48:05,218 --> 00:48:07,387
That the queen is--

687
00:48:07,887 --> 00:48:08,847
What?

688
00:48:10,015 --> 00:48:12,392
-Just tell us what it says!
-What's it say?

689
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:16,229
He doesn't know anything!
Boo!

690
00:48:16,563 --> 00:48:17,939
Fraud!

691
00:48:18,106 --> 00:48:21,067
<i>Dry your weeping eyes,
we're gonna be fine</i>

692
00:48:21,234 --> 00:48:23,278
<i>Everything is really gonna be all right</i>

693
00:48:23,445 --> 00:48:25,113
Ronin! Did you hear about the queen?

694
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,448
This is terrible!

695
00:48:26,614 --> 00:48:27,574
I know, but--

696
00:48:27,741 --> 00:48:28,742
We gotta do something!

697
00:48:28,908 --> 00:48:30,577
We gotta keep everyone
from freaking out!

698
00:48:30,744 --> 00:48:31,536
Yes, that's why we--

699
00:48:31,703 --> 00:48:34,789
And the Pod! We gotta make sure
the Royal Pod is safely hidden...

700
00:48:34,956 --> 00:48:36,958
far away. And--

701
00:48:37,125 --> 00:48:38,710
What'd you bring it here for?

702
00:48:38,877 --> 00:48:42,047
The queen's last words were
"Bring the Pod to Nim Galuu."

703
00:48:42,213 --> 00:48:45,633
She say anything else?
Specific instructions? Maybe a note?

704
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:49,179
Those were her last words.
I thought you were magic.

705
00:48:49,346 --> 00:48:51,014
Magic might be stretching it.

706
00:48:51,181 --> 00:48:53,850
I'm charismatic. Possibly charming.

707
00:48:54,017 --> 00:48:56,227
Do you know what to do
with the Pod or not?

708
00:48:56,394 --> 00:48:59,230
Not a clue, but I do know where
to look it up.

709
00:48:59,397 --> 00:49:00,357
Follow me!

710
00:49:00,523 --> 00:49:02,442
There he is!
Phony!

711
00:49:02,609 --> 00:49:05,153
Um, no, it's this way.

712
00:49:09,282 --> 00:49:11,659
The Rings of Knowledge!

713
00:49:12,369 --> 00:49:15,997
Is everything that happens
really recorded right here?

714
00:49:16,164 --> 00:49:17,123
Yeah.

715
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:18,875
And you've read all these scrolls?

716
00:49:19,042 --> 00:49:20,293
I've skimmed them.

717
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:23,838
So, is this event being recorded?
Right now?

718
00:49:24,005 --> 00:49:24,964
Of course.

719
00:49:25,882 --> 00:49:27,217
Is this?

720
00:49:27,384 --> 00:49:28,134
Yes.

721
00:49:28,301 --> 00:49:29,719
How about this?

722
00:49:34,974 --> 00:49:35,892
Yes.

723
00:49:36,059 --> 00:49:37,811
What about this?

724
00:49:45,652 --> 00:49:46,653
Yep.

725
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:48,488
That should be it right here.

726
00:49:48,655 --> 00:49:49,906
Thanks, Marty.

727
00:49:53,993 --> 00:49:56,329
Okay. Blooming a Pod.

728
00:49:56,496 --> 00:49:58,665
Gotta go way back for that.

729
00:49:59,165 --> 00:50:01,000
Here we go.

730
00:50:01,167 --> 00:50:02,335
Let's see.

731
00:50:02,502 --> 00:50:06,339
Pod, care of. Must keep moist.

732
00:50:08,883 --> 00:50:11,553
Well, good news is,
once the queen chooses it...

733
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,513
it's going to bloom no matter what.

734
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,557
But it has to open tonight...

735
00:50:15,724 --> 00:50:19,686
in the light of the full moon
when it's at its highest peak.

736
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:21,354
Yep, solstice...

737
00:50:21,521 --> 00:50:24,774
full moon, highest peak,
mentions it a bunch of times.

738
00:50:25,025 --> 00:50:27,277
What happens if it blooms
out of the moonlight?

739
00:50:27,944 --> 00:50:31,197
Unclear. The last part's missing.

740
00:50:31,364 --> 00:50:34,576
I gotta be honest,
termites have been a problem.

741
00:50:34,743 --> 00:50:36,870
So here I thought we were doomed.

742
00:50:37,037 --> 00:50:39,039
This calls for a celebration!

743
00:50:39,205 --> 00:50:41,708
I suppose we've earned it.

744
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:45,128
Wait...

745
00:50:45,378 --> 00:50:47,547
this is gonna sound weird, but...

746
00:50:47,714 --> 00:50:49,674
I'm not from this world.

747
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:52,510
And I thought maybe something
in these scrolls could tell me...

748
00:50:52,677 --> 00:50:54,679
if there's a way for me to get home.

749
00:50:54,846 --> 00:50:57,015
The scrolls don't tell the future...

750
00:50:57,182 --> 00:51:00,060
they only guide us
with the knowledge of the past.

751
00:51:00,226 --> 00:51:02,103
Hey, that's a great line!

752
00:51:02,270 --> 00:51:04,147
You guys got that, right?

753
00:51:04,314 --> 00:51:05,607
So you can't help me?

754
00:51:05,774 --> 00:51:07,525
I didn't say that.

755
00:51:11,154 --> 00:51:12,364
I can't read this.

756
00:51:12,530 --> 00:51:14,991
It's just dusty. Blow it off.

757
00:51:23,083 --> 00:51:24,626
It's you.

758
00:51:24,793 --> 00:51:28,129
But I saw you turn into moss.

759
00:51:28,421 --> 00:51:29,672
Come closer.

760
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:32,717
This is perfect!
You can make me big again.

761
00:51:33,009 --> 00:51:34,302
Closer.

762
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:41,851
It's a memory.

763
00:51:42,102 --> 00:51:44,145
If you can hear me now...

764
00:51:44,312 --> 00:51:46,690
it means you got to Nim's.

765
00:51:47,273 --> 00:51:48,900
The Pod needs you.

766
00:51:49,067 --> 00:51:52,362
I can't be around for it anymore.

767
00:51:57,033 --> 00:51:58,743
No, don't do that!

768
00:51:58,910 --> 00:52:00,078
Why would you give that to me?

769
00:52:00,245 --> 00:52:02,288
You don't understand,
I have to get home...

770
00:52:02,455 --> 00:52:04,082
this has nothing to do with me.

771
00:52:04,249 --> 00:52:06,126
You're here for a reason.

772
00:52:06,292 --> 00:52:08,628
Maybe you don't see the connections yet.

773
00:52:08,795 --> 00:52:12,757
But just because you don't see them
doesn't mean they're not there.

774
00:52:13,466 --> 00:52:16,344
I know you're scared.
Just stay with the Pod...

775
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:18,179
be with it when it blooms...

776
00:52:18,346 --> 00:52:22,017
and then you'll get back
what you've given.

777
00:52:22,183 --> 00:52:24,102
You'll get back.

778
00:52:27,397 --> 00:52:29,232
Well, that was intense.

779
00:52:29,399 --> 00:52:30,942
I gotta read more of these.

780
00:52:31,109 --> 00:52:33,403
That means I can get home!

781
00:52:33,737 --> 00:52:37,907
Well, if you want to go home so bad,
then why did you leave?

782
00:52:42,579 --> 00:52:44,914
Lose the sword, Ronin, we're done.

783
00:52:45,081 --> 00:52:46,958
We're not done until the Pod blooms.

784
00:52:47,125 --> 00:52:48,918
We're bringing it home to Moonhaven.

785
00:52:49,085 --> 00:52:52,338
I need you to watch it while I tell
the rest of the Leafmen to expect us.

786
00:52:52,505 --> 00:52:55,091
Hey, I helped you get here,
but I haven't changed my mind.

787
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:56,926
Do you think just because
you're not a Leafman anymore...

788
00:52:57,093 --> 00:52:58,386
you're not a part of this?

789
00:52:58,553 --> 00:53:01,806
The fate of that Pod affects all of us.

790
00:53:02,057 --> 00:53:04,309
The queen is gone.

791
00:53:04,476 --> 00:53:07,437
But, as always, she looked out for us...

792
00:53:07,604 --> 00:53:09,731
even in her final moments.

793
00:53:09,898 --> 00:53:14,486
Tonight, when this Pod blooms,
a new queen will rise!

794
00:53:14,652 --> 00:53:16,321
I know you're sad.

795
00:53:16,488 --> 00:53:18,198
I am, too.

796
00:53:18,365 --> 00:53:20,700
But Tara wouldn't want us to mourn!

797
00:53:20,867 --> 00:53:23,495
She'd want us to celebrate her life!

798
00:53:23,661 --> 00:53:25,955
And the life of the forest!

799
00:53:27,374 --> 00:53:28,625
So, stay with it.

800
00:53:28,792 --> 00:53:31,211
And don't lose the sword.

801
00:53:45,642 --> 00:53:48,687
Look, I'm thinking that I didn't make
the best first impression.

802
00:53:48,853 --> 00:53:52,816
It's okay. I've never had a guy
fight a mouse for me before.

803
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,610
You're not from around here, are you?

804
00:53:55,777 --> 00:53:57,070
What makes you say that?

805
00:53:57,237 --> 00:53:58,655
If you were, I would remember you.

806
00:53:58,822 --> 00:54:00,115
To Queen Tara!
To the queen!

807
00:54:00,281 --> 00:54:02,575
You wanna go somewhere quieter?

808
00:54:02,826 --> 00:54:04,661
Will that be okay with Ronin?

809
00:54:04,828 --> 00:54:06,037
Yeah, he said to watch the Pod...

810
00:54:06,204 --> 00:54:08,415
but there's nowhere safer
than Nim's tree.

811
00:54:08,581 --> 00:54:10,625
I think he's just pretty upset
about the queen.

812
00:54:10,792 --> 00:54:12,419
Here, let me show you something.

813
00:54:12,585 --> 00:54:13,628
What?

814
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:19,342
That actually gets easier.

815
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:20,844
What is--

816
00:54:28,059 --> 00:54:29,519
Wow.

817
00:54:49,205 --> 00:54:50,665
-Grab on!
-What?

818
00:54:50,832 --> 00:54:52,083
Put your arms around me.

819
00:54:52,667 --> 00:54:54,336
But I barely know you.

820
00:54:54,502 --> 00:54:56,129
Do you want to ride him or not?

821
00:55:16,358 --> 00:55:19,736
The scroll said there was nothing
you could do to save her, Ronin.

822
00:55:19,903 --> 00:55:22,072
You have to know that.

823
00:55:24,949 --> 00:55:26,951
Send a code to the Leafmen.

824
00:55:27,118 --> 00:55:29,788
Let them know the Pod is safe
and we're bringing it home.

825
00:55:29,954 --> 00:55:32,123
You heard him. Go tell them, boys!

826
00:55:32,290 --> 00:55:35,085
And it's happy hour at Nim's!

827
00:55:35,251 --> 00:55:37,420
Or just do the first part.

828
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:04,614
I gotta admit, flying is nice,
but this is riding in style.

829
00:56:05,865 --> 00:56:08,576
Yeah. Not everyone can do it.

830
00:56:08,743 --> 00:56:12,205
You have to be gentle to ride a deer.
My dad taught me how.

831
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:14,624
It's one of my best memories of him.

832
00:56:15,417 --> 00:56:17,502
You must really miss him.

833
00:56:18,545 --> 00:56:20,130
I know how that feels.

834
00:56:30,515 --> 00:56:31,641
Fruit fly, huh?

835
00:56:31,808 --> 00:56:34,728
So, what's it like,
having such a short life cycle?

836
00:56:34,894 --> 00:56:36,771
It's great, mister! When I grow up...

837
00:56:36,938 --> 00:56:37,564
I'm going to...

838
00:56:37,731 --> 00:56:40,692
wish I had done
more with my life, sonny.

839
00:56:45,822 --> 00:56:50,660
The forest trembles
at the passing of the humble fruit fly.

840
00:56:59,502 --> 00:57:03,673
Excuse me,
but I've lost something very dear to me.

841
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:07,886
It was left by a friend
who's no longer with us.

842
00:57:11,222 --> 00:57:12,974
You found it!

843
00:57:13,141 --> 00:57:16,186
If you want to take this Pod,
you're gonna have to go through us!

844
00:57:16,353 --> 00:57:19,606
Relax. I'm not going to hurt it.

845
00:57:19,773 --> 00:57:21,441
I need it alive.

846
00:57:21,608 --> 00:57:24,527
Well, we're the only ones
that know how to keep it that way.

847
00:57:24,694 --> 00:57:26,446
Thanks for the tip.

848
00:57:39,042 --> 00:57:41,086
Stay with the Pod,
that's all you had to do.

849
00:57:41,252 --> 00:57:42,253
Yeah, but I just thought--

850
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:44,297
Do you ever think about
anyone besides yourself?

851
00:57:44,464 --> 00:57:45,465
It wasn't all his fault!

852
00:57:45,632 --> 00:57:47,967
And you. I expected as much from him.

853
00:57:48,134 --> 00:57:49,469
But I thought you would know better.

854
00:57:49,636 --> 00:57:50,887
We're really sorry, okay?

855
00:57:51,054 --> 00:57:52,013
I don't want to hear it.

856
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:54,974
That was the last part of the queen
that I--

857
00:57:55,141 --> 00:57:57,394
That any of us will ever have.

858
00:57:58,687 --> 00:58:01,481
The queen gave it to me.
I should have been here with it.

859
00:58:01,648 --> 00:58:03,983
I'll do whatever it takes
to help you get it back.

860
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:06,986
I appreciate the offer,
but Wrathwood is too dangerous.

861
00:58:07,153 --> 00:58:08,321
But you can't go alone.

862
00:58:08,488 --> 00:58:12,659
What about the whole
leaves-tree thing that you said?

863
00:58:12,826 --> 00:58:14,077
Nim, tell him.

864
00:58:14,244 --> 00:58:16,162
Look, kid, the moon's coming up.

865
00:58:16,329 --> 00:58:17,747
That's bloom-or-die time.

866
00:58:17,914 --> 00:58:19,582
So if no one has a better plan--

867
00:58:19,749 --> 00:58:22,001
Why don't we sneak in, in disguise?

868
00:58:22,168 --> 00:58:23,670
Great idea.

869
00:58:23,837 --> 00:58:26,881
I'll go as a grasshopper
and you can be my cricket ladyfriend.

870
00:58:27,048 --> 00:58:30,176
It's dangerous, I might get killed.
I thought you'd like that.

871
00:58:30,343 --> 00:58:33,179
I don't have any Boggan armor handy.
Do you?

872
00:58:33,346 --> 00:58:35,682
I know where we can get some.

873
00:58:38,435 --> 00:58:40,020
Well?

874
00:58:40,186 --> 00:58:42,897
I gotta say,
six hands are better than two.

875
00:58:43,064 --> 00:58:45,275
That's been my experience.

876
00:58:46,359 --> 00:58:48,903
You might want to hang on.

877
00:58:53,783 --> 00:58:55,577
Stop! Please!

878
00:58:55,744 --> 00:58:59,873
My son was born on a night like this.

879
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:01,875
These were his baby fangs.

880
00:59:02,042 --> 00:59:04,711
And here's the first skin
he ever molted.

881
00:59:04,878 --> 00:59:06,880
He was big for a larva.

882
00:59:07,047 --> 00:59:08,798
He took after his mother.

883
00:59:08,965 --> 00:59:12,260
Your stories are boring and torturous!

884
00:59:13,219 --> 00:59:16,056
And the Leafmen took him from me.

885
00:59:16,306 --> 00:59:19,768
So I took something of theirs.
It's basic etiquette.

886
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:22,937
An eye for an eye.

887
00:59:23,104 --> 00:59:24,314
Jerk!

888
00:59:24,481 --> 00:59:27,817
Tonight your Pod will bloom here.

889
00:59:27,984 --> 00:59:31,404
And when a Pod blooms in darkness,
it belongs...

890
00:59:31,571 --> 00:59:33,239
to the darkness.

891
00:59:33,406 --> 00:59:37,410
It will become my little dark prince.

892
00:59:37,577 --> 00:59:41,748
I'll destroy the forest with the
very thing you hoped would save it.

893
00:59:44,167 --> 00:59:48,088
I hate to break it to you,
but it doesn't say that in the scrolls.

894
00:59:48,254 --> 00:59:50,215
It does in the part I have.

895
01:00:10,777 --> 01:00:12,320
Hey, the Boggan armor...

896
01:00:12,487 --> 01:00:14,280
where is it?

897
01:00:14,447 --> 01:00:15,532
Over there.

898
01:00:15,699 --> 01:00:16,825
Let's make this quick.

899
01:00:33,133 --> 01:00:34,384
Come on.

900
01:00:44,978 --> 01:00:45,854
Ow!

901
01:00:57,699 --> 01:01:01,327
That was awesome. Here.

902
01:01:01,703 --> 01:01:02,996
Up we go.

903
01:01:03,913 --> 01:01:06,082
That is some static cling.

904
01:01:06,249 --> 01:01:08,877
No, that's metal, don't touch that!

905
01:01:11,838 --> 01:01:12,922
Ow!

906
01:01:13,089 --> 01:01:14,174
Knock it off.

907
01:01:14,341 --> 01:01:15,884
Ow. Quit it.

908
01:01:16,051 --> 01:01:17,177
Ow! No, you quit.

909
01:01:17,344 --> 01:01:18,511
-I'm not doing it.
-Stop!

910
01:01:18,678 --> 01:01:19,888
Ow. I'm not doing--

911
01:01:20,055 --> 01:01:21,056
Now!

912
01:01:23,350 --> 01:01:24,517
Come on.

913
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:37,739
You know...

914
01:01:37,906 --> 01:01:39,699
some of this stuff looks familiar.

915
01:01:39,866 --> 01:01:42,535
Hey, that's my saddle!

916
01:01:42,702 --> 01:01:44,204
Where are we?

917
01:01:54,756 --> 01:01:58,093
Oh, it's where this guy lives.

918
01:02:02,514 --> 01:02:04,182
I can't believe it.

919
01:02:04,349 --> 01:02:07,227
He's been crashing around
the forest like a bear for years.

920
01:02:07,394 --> 01:02:10,105
Most stompers just come and go,
but this guy's relentless.

921
01:02:10,271 --> 01:02:11,564
Wait. Stompers?

922
01:02:11,731 --> 01:02:12,565
Yeah.

923
01:02:12,732 --> 01:02:15,735
Like us, but big and dumb and slow...

924
01:02:15,902 --> 01:02:18,363
always stomping on things. Stompers.

925
01:02:18,530 --> 01:02:20,740
And this one is obsessed with finding us.

926
01:02:20,907 --> 01:02:22,534
Obviously that's a security risk.

927
01:02:22,742 --> 01:02:25,245
Can't have one of his big fat feet
stepping on Moonhaven.

928
01:02:25,412 --> 01:02:28,873
One of his ginormous, flabby, dirty, stinky--

929
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:30,417
Okay, I got it.

930
01:02:30,583 --> 01:02:32,252
So we've been throwing him off the trail.

931
01:02:32,419 --> 01:02:33,712
So you're just messing with him?

932
01:02:34,087 --> 01:02:35,755
But he's found all this stuff.

933
01:02:35,922 --> 01:02:37,882
He only finds what we want him to find.

934
01:02:38,049 --> 01:02:39,092
Look at his map.

935
01:02:39,259 --> 01:02:42,387
We've got him looking everywhere
but where we are.

936
01:02:42,929 --> 01:02:45,015
I love how this guy talks.

937
01:02:45,181 --> 01:02:48,935
"Look at this flower."

938
01:02:49,102 --> 01:02:53,231
"I hurt my elbow."

939
01:02:53,398 --> 01:02:54,441
I think that's kind of mean.

940
01:02:54,607 --> 01:02:56,026
"Who said that?"

941
01:02:56,192 --> 01:02:58,069
It's his life's work.

942
01:02:58,236 --> 01:03:00,363
He's my dad!

943
01:03:00,905 --> 01:03:01,906
He what?

944
01:03:02,073 --> 01:03:03,908
I'm a stomper.

945
01:03:04,909 --> 01:03:06,286
What happened? You got shrunk?

946
01:03:06,453 --> 01:03:09,080
Yes! Which he knows.

947
01:03:09,247 --> 01:03:10,206
Seriously?

948
01:03:10,874 --> 01:03:12,459
It's been a weird day for everybody.

949
01:03:12,625 --> 01:03:14,586
You got a problem with stompers?

950
01:03:14,753 --> 01:03:16,588
A stomper squashed my uncle.

951
01:03:16,755 --> 01:03:18,631
Oh, my gosh. Really?

952
01:03:18,798 --> 01:03:20,800
No. I'm messing with you.

953
01:03:23,762 --> 01:03:24,554
Too far?

954
01:03:24,888 --> 01:03:27,223
Try it again, maybe she'll punch you harder.

955
01:03:41,446 --> 01:03:43,782
I'm sorry.

956
01:03:46,951 --> 01:03:49,746
I guess she's right about me, huh, Ozzy?

957
01:03:52,707 --> 01:03:54,542
All I seem to be able to do is...

958
01:03:54,709 --> 01:03:57,670
drive people away.

959
01:03:57,837 --> 01:04:01,049
No, Dad, you didn't! I'm here!

960
01:04:01,216 --> 01:04:03,968
And you're right about all of it.
Don't stop looking.

961
01:04:04,135 --> 01:04:05,261
Not now.

962
01:04:10,809 --> 01:04:14,479
Dad! Dad, just turn around!

963
01:04:19,484 --> 01:04:20,652
Uh-oh.

964
01:04:21,528 --> 01:04:22,612
Ozzy...

965
01:04:22,779 --> 01:04:24,864
no kisses.

966
01:04:29,369 --> 01:04:30,370
Ozzy!

967
01:04:34,833 --> 01:04:36,459
Hey, how do I look?

968
01:04:36,626 --> 01:04:38,169
Scary as ever.

969
01:04:45,802 --> 01:04:46,886
Are you okay?

970
01:04:50,682 --> 01:04:51,808
Run!

971
01:04:56,146 --> 01:04:57,856
Ozzy, will you please stop?

972
01:05:04,404 --> 01:05:05,488
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

973
01:05:05,655 --> 01:05:08,658
They're here! They're in my house!

974
01:05:26,092 --> 01:05:26,760
No!

975
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:30,221
Ow!

976
01:05:30,388 --> 01:05:34,225
I hurt my elbow!

977
01:05:34,392 --> 01:05:37,103
Did you hear that? He said it!

978
01:06:13,473 --> 01:06:15,141
No! Don't let go!

979
01:06:15,809 --> 01:06:17,143
Don't let go! No!

980
01:06:26,277 --> 01:06:29,239
Hello there, my little friend!

981
01:06:30,156 --> 01:06:31,991
Dad! Dad!

982
01:06:34,911 --> 01:06:37,163
Dad! Dad!

983
01:07:01,187 --> 01:07:02,272
Let's go.

984
01:07:02,939 --> 01:07:05,692
You can't stay. You're with us now!

985
01:07:08,695 --> 01:07:12,115
I'll come home soon, Dad. I promise.

986
01:07:22,876 --> 01:07:24,044
Come on, MK, we gotta go.

987
01:07:31,718 --> 01:07:33,636
You think he's okay?

988
01:07:33,803 --> 01:07:36,681
Yeah, he'll be fine,
their heads are like rocks.

989
01:07:36,848 --> 01:07:38,516
Smart rocks.

990
01:08:00,330 --> 01:08:02,832
That's a whole lot of ugly.

991
01:08:03,833 --> 01:08:06,169
It smells like something died in here.

992
01:08:06,336 --> 01:08:07,587
Something did.

993
01:08:15,512 --> 01:08:16,846
How do we know where to go?

994
01:08:17,013 --> 01:08:18,098
I've been here before...

995
01:08:18,848 --> 01:08:20,100
with your father.

996
01:08:20,350 --> 01:08:23,269
He never told me about this.

997
01:08:23,436 --> 01:08:25,021
He never got the chance.

998
01:08:39,786 --> 01:08:41,454
How's my dark prince?

999
01:08:41,621 --> 01:08:42,914
It's fine!

1000
01:08:43,289 --> 01:08:46,751
Good. Because if it dies, you die.

1001
01:08:46,918 --> 01:08:49,421
We know. You said.

1002
01:08:49,587 --> 01:08:50,755
Ugly says "what"?

1003
01:08:51,089 --> 01:08:52,048
What?

1004
01:08:52,215 --> 01:08:53,299
Nothing.

1005
01:09:35,592 --> 01:09:37,135
There's our exit.

1006
01:09:37,302 --> 01:09:39,679
Meet me back here when
you've got the Pod and the slugs.

1007
01:09:39,846 --> 01:09:41,514
How are we supposed to find them?

1008
01:09:41,681 --> 01:09:42,807
Follow the slime.

1009
01:09:46,019 --> 01:09:47,354
Aren't you coming with us?

1010
01:09:47,687 --> 01:09:49,939
I'm gonna make sure nobody follows you.

1011
01:09:50,106 --> 01:09:52,150
Don't worry, you get the easy part...

1012
01:09:52,317 --> 01:09:54,027
I get the fun part.

1013
01:09:57,364 --> 01:09:59,991
Hey, look! It's a Leafman!

1014
01:10:01,159 --> 01:10:02,535
I'll keep this simple.

1015
01:10:02,702 --> 01:10:03,787
I run...

1016
01:10:03,953 --> 01:10:05,497
you try to catch me.

1017
01:10:15,548 --> 01:10:16,966
Let's go.

1018
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:31,022
When I get big again, I am so coming
back here with a can of bug spray.

1019
01:10:34,025 --> 01:10:36,319
Mub. Grub.

1020
01:10:37,737 --> 01:10:39,030
We're down here!

1021
01:10:41,074 --> 01:10:43,535
I told you she'd come for me.

1022
01:10:44,077 --> 01:10:46,204
This girl is smitten.

1023
01:10:47,205 --> 01:10:48,832
Hand me the Pod!

1024
01:10:48,998 --> 01:10:51,543
Come on, you should work on
your grip, my dude.

1025
01:10:51,710 --> 01:10:53,336
It's a bit womanly.

1026
01:10:54,421 --> 01:10:55,588
No, no, no!

1027
01:10:57,257 --> 01:10:58,883
Hurry, before the guards come back!

1028
01:10:59,050 --> 01:11:00,385
Too late!

1029
01:11:00,552 --> 01:11:01,928
I have a plan! Quick!

1030
01:11:02,095 --> 01:11:04,389
Everybody hide in your shells!

1031
01:11:06,891 --> 01:11:08,852
Oh. I have another plan!

1032
01:11:17,902 --> 01:11:19,404
Go! Go!

1033
01:11:19,571 --> 01:11:20,739
Ow! That hurts!

1034
01:11:20,905 --> 01:11:22,282
Those are my eyes!

1035
01:11:22,449 --> 01:11:24,034
Can you go any faster?

1036
01:11:25,618 --> 01:11:28,288
It's kind of hard
when you're pulling on my brain!

1037
01:11:35,086 --> 01:11:37,255
Ronin!

1038
01:11:37,464 --> 01:11:38,965
What a surprise.

1039
01:11:39,132 --> 01:11:41,134
I get so few guests.

1040
01:11:41,301 --> 01:11:44,304
Could be the stench of death.
Some people don't care for it.

1041
01:11:45,221 --> 01:11:46,389
It's all right.

1042
01:11:46,806 --> 01:11:48,391
Ronin's an old--

1043
01:11:48,558 --> 01:11:51,144
What do you call someone
you've known a long time...

1044
01:11:51,311 --> 01:11:53,980
and always wanted to destroy?

1045
01:11:59,736 --> 01:12:01,821
I expected you to come.

1046
01:12:02,655 --> 01:12:04,783
But I didn't think you'd come alone.

1047
01:12:06,951 --> 01:12:08,286
Who said I'm alone?

1048
01:12:11,498 --> 01:12:12,499
Whoa.

1049
01:12:32,268 --> 01:12:34,729
So, what's the plan here?

1050
01:12:34,896 --> 01:12:37,899
A hundred Leafmen? A thousand?

1051
01:12:38,733 --> 01:12:40,860
Don't flatter yourself.

1052
01:12:51,579 --> 01:12:54,290
Well, now I'm just embarrassed.

1053
01:12:54,791 --> 01:12:57,377
I completely over-prepared.

1054
01:13:17,147 --> 01:13:18,606
Go, go, go!

1055
01:13:25,321 --> 01:13:27,615
I'm afraid you'll find getting out...

1056
01:13:27,782 --> 01:13:30,535
is a lot harder than getting in.

1057
01:13:39,836 --> 01:13:40,712
Ronin!

1058
01:13:40,879 --> 01:13:42,047
Hang on!

1059
01:13:43,590 --> 01:13:46,468
Go! Take the Pod to Moonhaven!

1060
01:13:46,634 --> 01:13:48,094
I'm not leaving without you!

1061
01:13:48,261 --> 01:13:52,098
Now you're starting
to sound like a Leafman!

1062
01:13:54,726 --> 01:13:55,894
Ronin!

1063
01:14:03,068 --> 01:14:04,319
Come on!

1064
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:09,634
We've been waiting for you.
Where's Ronin?

1065
01:15:10,176 --> 01:15:12,929
He gave us a head start.

1066
01:15:15,223 --> 01:15:16,891
But the Boggans aren't far behind.

1067
01:15:57,265 --> 01:15:59,517
You guys made it! I knew you would.

1068
01:15:59,684 --> 01:16:00,977
You got that from the scrolls?

1069
01:16:01,144 --> 01:16:03,396
Some things you just know.

1070
01:16:24,250 --> 01:16:25,251
Let's see.

1071
01:16:25,418 --> 01:16:28,338
Moonlight comes in here,
moves along here...

1072
01:16:28,505 --> 01:16:30,632
reaches the Pod here.

1073
01:16:31,174 --> 01:16:32,801
At the moon's highest peak.

1074
01:16:33,009 --> 01:16:35,220
Only time it can bloom.

1075
01:16:35,387 --> 01:16:37,013
Do you know what this means?

1076
01:16:37,180 --> 01:16:40,392
We single-handedly saved the forest!

1077
01:16:40,558 --> 01:16:44,312
Eye five! Down low. Too slow.

1078
01:16:45,188 --> 01:16:49,150
So, when the Pod opens,
what happens to you?

1079
01:16:49,317 --> 01:16:51,361
I think I go home.

1080
01:16:52,112 --> 01:16:54,364
Well, I guess this is--

1081
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:58,410
Yeah, I guess it is.

1082
01:17:29,399 --> 01:17:30,942
Mandrake's bats!

1083
01:17:45,498 --> 01:17:49,169
They're not attacking,
they're just blocking out the moon.

1084
01:18:03,850 --> 01:18:05,018
Are you ready for this?

1085
01:18:05,185 --> 01:18:06,144
Are you kidding?

1086
01:18:06,311 --> 01:18:09,189
We're outnumbered, out of time
and the fate of the world is at stake.

1087
01:18:09,356 --> 01:18:10,482
Why did I quit again?

1088
01:18:10,690 --> 01:18:11,524
See you up there.

1089
01:18:11,858 --> 01:18:14,319
As soon as I can find my helmet.

1090
01:18:14,486 --> 01:18:15,362
Thank you.

1091
01:18:15,528 --> 01:18:16,363
Hey, guys!

1092
01:18:16,529 --> 01:18:18,990
I'm going to need a uniform! And a bird!

1093
01:18:20,825 --> 01:18:23,286
That's all right. I'll find them myself.

1094
01:18:23,453 --> 01:18:24,788
A Leafman makes do.

1095
01:18:59,406 --> 01:19:01,241
What are you doing?

1096
01:19:01,408 --> 01:19:03,243
-I'm going to help.
-Whoa, whoa.

1097
01:19:03,410 --> 01:19:05,078
You heard the queen!
If you want to get home...

1098
01:19:05,245 --> 01:19:07,622
you have to be here with
the Pod when it blooms.

1099
01:19:07,789 --> 01:19:09,124
Isn't that what you want?

1100
01:19:09,290 --> 01:19:10,458
So I should just sit here?

1101
01:19:10,625 --> 01:19:11,751
I didn't say that.

1102
01:19:11,918 --> 01:19:13,211
Then I'm going up there.

1103
01:19:13,378 --> 01:19:14,754
I didn't say that either.

1104
01:19:14,921 --> 01:19:16,756
You don't even know what you're saying.

1105
01:19:16,923 --> 01:19:18,967
I'm saying, who gives up everything...

1106
01:19:19,134 --> 01:19:21,094
for a world that's not even theirs?

1107
01:19:23,638 --> 01:19:25,932
Dad. My dad does!

1108
01:19:26,099 --> 01:19:27,142
I have to get my dad!

1109
01:19:27,308 --> 01:19:28,560
Where do you think you're going?

1110
01:19:28,727 --> 01:19:30,603
The queen said I was here for a reason.

1111
01:19:30,770 --> 01:19:32,439
This must be it.

1112
01:19:32,605 --> 01:19:33,940
That's my girl.

1113
01:19:40,488 --> 01:19:43,450
Oh, come on!

1114
01:20:02,635 --> 01:20:04,596
Mandrake! He's headed for Moonhaven!

1115
01:20:09,434 --> 01:20:12,937
Grub! The Pod! It's blooming in darkness!

1116
01:20:19,569 --> 01:20:20,820
Whoa!

1117
01:20:22,822 --> 01:20:24,074
Hey, Dad!

1118
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:25,950
Come on, I need your help!

1119
01:20:52,811 --> 01:20:55,146
They're all right about me, Ozzy.

1120
01:20:55,313 --> 01:20:58,441
All these years just chasing things
that aren't even there.

1121
01:20:58,608 --> 01:21:03,738
I actually thought I saw my daughter,
two inches tall, stuck in a bug jar.

1122
01:21:04,531 --> 01:21:06,241
I've lost my mind.

1123
01:21:07,075 --> 01:21:09,119
And I am talking to a dog.

1124
01:21:15,250 --> 01:21:16,459
Hey, Dad!

1125
01:21:16,626 --> 01:21:18,920
Come on, I need your help, Dad!

1126
01:21:19,879 --> 01:21:21,548
What? No! No!

1127
01:21:23,717 --> 01:21:25,176
Dad, look at me!

1128
01:21:25,385 --> 01:21:28,471
I'm right here!
Just check your cameras!

1129
01:21:34,019 --> 01:21:35,020
Ozzy, please.

1130
01:21:35,186 --> 01:21:36,730
I've made up my mind, okay?

1131
01:21:38,064 --> 01:21:39,024
Quiet!

1132
01:21:39,190 --> 01:21:41,818
I don't care anymore.

1133
01:21:41,985 --> 01:21:44,654
All I want now, is to find my daughter!

1134
01:21:45,864 --> 01:21:47,615
Dad, please!

1135
01:21:47,782 --> 01:21:49,367
Please, I need you.

1136
01:22:05,258 --> 01:22:06,343
MK!

1137
01:22:32,702 --> 01:22:35,538
I am so over Boggans.

1138
01:22:46,925 --> 01:22:47,842
Ozzy!

1139
01:22:53,973 --> 01:22:54,974
Dad!

1140
01:23:13,660 --> 01:23:16,162
Don't faint!

1141
01:23:16,329 --> 01:23:18,998
I won't!

1142
01:23:19,833 --> 01:23:22,085
<i>How did you find me?</i>

1143
01:23:22,252 --> 01:23:26,631
I got your message.

1144
01:23:26,798 --> 01:23:28,800
<i>You were right.</i>

1145
01:23:28,967 --> 01:23:31,094
About what?

1146
01:23:32,470 --> 01:23:34,264
<i>About everything.</i>

1147
01:23:34,931 --> 01:23:36,766
I'm sorry.

1148
01:23:38,685 --> 01:23:40,020
Me, too.

1149
01:23:43,189 --> 01:23:46,860
How did you get so small?

1150
01:23:47,193 --> 01:23:50,989
<i>Dad, it was amazing!
They're real!</i>

1151
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:55,535
And they need your help.

1152
01:23:57,662 --> 01:23:59,539
<i>Follow me!</i>

1153
01:24:10,675 --> 01:24:11,468
Missed me.

1154
01:24:11,718 --> 01:24:13,887
I wasn't aiming for you.

1155
01:24:46,544 --> 01:24:49,422
This must be the delivery room.

1156
01:24:49,881 --> 01:24:52,592
Whoa! Boy, are you lost!
Down the hall...

1157
01:24:52,759 --> 01:24:56,680
make a left, and then when you see
the janitor with a weird eye--

1158
01:24:56,846 --> 01:24:58,431
Shut up!

1159
01:25:01,267 --> 01:25:03,269
My dark prince.

1160
01:25:03,436 --> 01:25:05,105
Come to Daddy.

1161
01:25:05,271 --> 01:25:07,190
I don't think it likes you.

1162
01:25:07,357 --> 01:25:08,108
Ronin!

1163
01:25:08,441 --> 01:25:10,944
You know how many Boggans
I had to fight to get here?

1164
01:25:11,277 --> 01:25:13,029
Seriously, I lost count.

1165
01:25:13,196 --> 01:25:14,948
Well, what's one more?

1166
01:25:23,123 --> 01:25:24,249
It's all real!

1167
01:25:24,416 --> 01:25:25,917
It's really here!

1168
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:29,796
Dad, the bats!
We have to get them away from the moon.

1169
01:25:29,963 --> 01:25:33,133
It's so beautiful.

1170
01:25:33,591 --> 01:25:34,801
There's no time!

1171
01:25:34,968 --> 01:25:38,972
But what matters most is--

1172
01:25:39,139 --> 01:25:41,766
Not now!

1173
01:25:52,485 --> 01:25:53,611
Oh!

1174
01:25:54,404 --> 01:25:55,989
You want me to play
the frequencies that...

1175
01:25:56,406 --> 01:25:58,408
attract the--

1176
01:26:09,002 --> 01:26:11,171
Run! I'll find you, Dad!

1177
01:26:11,338 --> 01:26:13,173
I just have to get back before--

1178
01:26:18,386 --> 01:26:20,513
They really do go in your hair!

1179
01:26:30,023 --> 01:26:31,858
This time, when I leave you for dead...

1180
01:26:32,025 --> 01:26:33,193
you'll stay that way!

1181
01:26:36,529 --> 01:26:39,199
What's that little saying
you people have?

1182
01:26:39,491 --> 01:26:42,369
"Lots of leaves, something-something"?

1183
01:26:42,535 --> 01:26:44,871
Very inspiring.

1184
01:26:45,330 --> 01:26:49,167
But in the end
every leaf falls and dies alone.

1185
01:26:51,211 --> 01:26:52,754
No one is alone.

1186
01:26:57,676 --> 01:26:58,718
Not even him.

1187
01:28:46,826 --> 01:28:48,995
Look after them for me.

1188
01:28:55,085 --> 01:28:57,128
There's that smile.

1189
01:29:14,521 --> 01:29:16,189
Your Majesty.

1190
01:29:37,627 --> 01:29:39,045
You look terrible.

1191
01:29:40,046 --> 01:29:43,133
Hey, did you see how many times
I got hit?

1192
01:29:43,299 --> 01:29:45,051
I learned that from you.

1193
01:29:45,218 --> 01:29:46,803
You're not going to make me say
all the stuff...

1194
01:29:46,970 --> 01:29:48,680
I learned from you now, are you?

1195
01:29:48,847 --> 01:29:51,683
Well, you'd have learned
a heck of a lot more from your dad.

1196
01:29:51,850 --> 01:29:54,227
I was a pretty poor substitute.

1197
01:29:55,061 --> 01:29:58,398
Don't beat yourself up.
Lately you've shown some real promise.

1198
01:29:58,565 --> 01:30:00,316
Oh, please.

1199
01:30:00,483 --> 01:30:02,068
Just say you love each other.

1200
01:30:03,319 --> 01:30:04,738
I thought we just did.

1201
01:30:04,904 --> 01:30:06,990
Hey, you're still here.

1202
01:30:07,198 --> 01:30:08,825
Yeah.

1203
01:30:09,159 --> 01:30:10,744
I guess I missed my chance.

1204
01:30:10,910 --> 01:30:12,328
I'm sorry.

1205
01:30:12,495 --> 01:30:15,415
But not completely sorry.

1206
01:30:16,750 --> 01:30:18,835
Wow! Strong grip!

1207
01:30:19,336 --> 01:30:20,503
What's happening?

1208
01:30:20,754 --> 01:30:24,424
A queen brought you here.
How about a queen sends you back?

1209
01:30:25,842 --> 01:30:27,886
It's working!

1210
01:30:29,763 --> 01:30:30,930
We have to say goodbye!

1211
01:30:31,097 --> 01:30:32,098
What for?

1212
01:30:32,265 --> 01:30:33,350
You're part of us.

1213
01:30:33,516 --> 01:30:35,935
Many leaves, I always say.

1214
01:30:36,102 --> 01:30:38,772
I mean, the Leafmen say.

1215
01:30:38,938 --> 01:30:41,608
Not that I'm a Leafman.

1216
01:30:42,108 --> 01:30:43,568
Says who?

1217
01:30:45,070 --> 01:30:46,446
We'll find each other!

1218
01:30:47,072 --> 01:30:49,074
Just follow the slime!

1219
01:30:49,783 --> 01:30:51,451
I will, Mub.

1220
01:30:52,744 --> 01:30:53,953
You're really leaving.

1221
01:30:54,287 --> 01:30:56,456
Put your arms around me.

1222
01:31:41,543 --> 01:31:44,295
I always hoped if I...

1223
01:31:44,838 --> 01:31:47,382
if I proved it to her...

1224
01:31:50,510 --> 01:31:52,220
she'd...

1225
01:31:53,513 --> 01:31:54,931
you know.

1226
01:32:09,195 --> 01:32:10,780
Well, what do you think?

1227
01:32:10,947 --> 01:32:12,657
It's perfect, Dad.

1228
01:32:12,824 --> 01:32:16,036
Except, the boots are higher
and the sleeves are longer.

1229
01:32:16,202 --> 01:32:18,788
And they wear actual helmets,
not acorns.

1230
01:32:18,955 --> 01:32:20,040
Really?

1231
01:32:20,790 --> 01:32:23,209
They should seriously consider
the potential.

1232
01:32:23,501 --> 01:32:24,377
Ozzy!

1233
01:32:26,254 --> 01:32:27,881
Here you go, boy.

1234
01:32:38,475 --> 01:32:40,143
Go. It's always for you, anyway.

1235
01:32:45,774 --> 01:32:47,150
-Hey.
<i>-Hey!</i>

1236
01:32:47,317 --> 01:32:48,234
How's work?

1237
01:32:48,401 --> 01:32:50,153
<i>No, it's not work
when you love your job.</i>

1238
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:52,947
<i>"Many leaves, one tree,"
that's what I always say.</i>

1239
01:32:53,114 --> 01:32:54,115
Uh-huh.

1240
01:32:54,282 --> 01:32:56,618
What do you think you're doing, Leafboy?

1241
01:32:56,785 --> 01:32:58,995
Leafman. You know it's Leafman.

1242
01:32:59,162 --> 01:32:59,954
Is it?

1243
01:33:00,121 --> 01:33:02,999
<i>I wasn't sure.
Hey, MK!</i>

1244
01:33:03,208 --> 01:33:04,793
<i>What's going on, baby girl?</i>

1245
01:33:05,460 --> 01:33:06,628
Hi, Mub.

1246
01:33:06,795 --> 01:33:07,879
We were talking.

1247
01:33:08,046 --> 01:33:11,341
There's a big sack of "shut your
flat face" over there by that tree.

1248
01:33:11,508 --> 01:33:12,842
<i>Why don't you go pick it up?</i>

1249
01:33:13,009 --> 01:33:13,968
Listen, slick.

1250
01:33:14,135 --> 01:33:15,178
<i>Guys, don't fight.</i>

1251
01:33:15,345 --> 01:33:19,516
It won't be a fight. I could whip him
with both eyes behind my back.

1252
01:33:19,683 --> 01:33:21,184
<i>I'd like to see you try, jelly butt.</i>

1253
01:33:21,351 --> 01:33:23,311
<i>I didn't want to have to do this!</i>

1254
01:33:26,940 --> 01:33:29,818
Mub, get him out of your mouth!

1255
01:33:31,653 --> 01:33:35,407
Dad, I gotta go
Heimlich my friend out of a slug.

1256
01:33:35,573 --> 01:33:37,492
Yeah, that looks pretty weird.

1257
01:33:37,659 --> 01:33:39,411
Here don't forget this.

1258
01:33:41,204 --> 01:33:45,125
Tell them about the acorn helmets.

1259
01:33:45,458 --> 01:33:47,752
Or you could tell them yourself.

1260
01:33:49,254 --> 01:33:50,255
Come on, Ozzy!
