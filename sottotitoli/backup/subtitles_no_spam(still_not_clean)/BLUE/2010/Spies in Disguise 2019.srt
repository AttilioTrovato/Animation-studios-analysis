1
00:00:40,181 --> 00:00:42,381

2
00:01:15,941 --> 00:01:18,143
Walter, have you seen
my tweezers?

3
00:01:28,986 --> 00:01:32,020
Um, sorry.
Did you need that mug?

4
00:01:32,022 --> 00:01:34,393
I needed that coffee.

5
00:01:36,561 --> 00:01:37,794
So...

6
00:01:37,796 --> 00:01:40,029
- <i>Unitee.</i>
- ...what you making, bud?

7
00:01:40,031 --> 00:01:41,130
A gadget for you

8
00:01:41,132 --> 00:01:42,464
- to wear on patrol.
- Oh.

9
00:01:42,466 --> 00:01:45,100
It's the perfect tool
to keep you safe.

10
00:01:45,102 --> 00:01:46,636
This button
makes a really loud sound

11
00:01:46,638 --> 00:01:48,437
to incapacitate your enemies.

12
00:01:51,942 --> 00:01:53,076
Like that.

13
00:01:53,078 --> 00:01:55,243
This one can wrap you
in an inflatable hug

14
00:01:55,245 --> 00:01:57,079
- so no one can hurt you.
- A-ha.

15
00:01:57,081 --> 00:02:00,016
And this one is for when
you're outnumbered.

16
00:02:00,018 --> 00:02:02,851
You just hold out your hand
and say, "Stop!"

17
00:02:02,853 --> 00:02:04,220
And boom!

18
00:02:04,222 --> 00:02:06,255
Glitter cloud!

19
00:02:06,257 --> 00:02:08,257
And the bad guys
will leave you alone.

20
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:11,460
Oh! Because glitter makes
people happy?

21
00:02:11,462 --> 00:02:12,961
Because the refracted light

22
00:02:12,963 --> 00:02:14,631
causes the
enterochromaffin cells

23
00:02:14,633 --> 00:02:16,401
to release serotonin.

24
00:02:19,104 --> 00:02:21,273
Yeah, glitter makes
people happy.

25
00:02:22,073 --> 00:02:23,239
Let's try it out.

26
00:02:23,241 --> 00:02:24,340
Remember how you told me

27
00:02:24,342 --> 00:02:25,708
not to take apart
your cell phone?

28
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:28,514
Walter Beckett,
you took apart my...

29
00:02:31,682 --> 00:02:32,850
Still wanna kill me?

30
00:02:33,985 --> 00:02:36,519
No. Just the opposite.

31
00:02:36,521 --> 00:02:37,453
Then it works!

32
00:02:37,455 --> 00:02:39,287
I also wanna add
some kitten visuals

33
00:02:39,289 --> 00:02:41,223
to trigger
the orbitofrontal cortex.

34
00:02:41,225 --> 00:02:42,291
<i>11-A-25,</i>

35
00:02:42,293 --> 00:02:44,060
<i>Code Six, 104 North.</i>

36
00:02:44,062 --> 00:02:45,193
Hon, I gotta go.

37
00:02:45,195 --> 00:02:46,397
Time for my shift.

38
00:02:47,831 --> 00:02:49,465
Be good for Gram, okay?

39
00:02:49,467 --> 00:02:50,933
Uh, I'll come
with you.

40
00:02:50,935 --> 00:02:52,467
I can finish this
on the way.

41
00:02:52,469 --> 00:02:54,002
You won't even
know I'm there.

42
00:02:54,004 --> 00:02:58,406
What you need to
do is get ready for school.

43
00:02:58,408 --> 00:03:01,077
Oh, Mom,
school's boring.

44
00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:03,613
And the kids
think I'm weird.

45
00:03:03,615 --> 00:03:04,913
Weird?

46
00:03:04,915 --> 00:03:06,149
Hey, look at me.

47
00:03:06,151 --> 00:03:07,784
What's wrong with weird?

48
00:03:07,786 --> 00:03:09,786
The world needs weird.

49
00:03:09,788 --> 00:03:13,825
Listen, I'm out there
keeping the neighborhood safe.

50
00:03:14,391 --> 00:03:17,927
But one day, your ideas...

51
00:03:17,929 --> 00:03:20,328
your gadgets...

52
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:23,465
are gonna keep
the world safe.

53
00:03:23,467 --> 00:03:27,872
And everybody will wish
they were as weird as you.

54
00:03:28,873 --> 00:03:29,875
You think?

55
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,243
I know.

56
00:03:33,711 --> 00:03:36,581
Now, give me
a non-inflatable hug.

57
00:03:40,185 --> 00:03:41,687
Love you, partner.

58
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,557
I promise
I'll always have your back.

59
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:49,694
Team Weird?

60
00:03:51,128 --> 00:03:52,663
Team Weird.

61
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,885
Man, it's cold!

62
00:04:15,652 --> 00:04:17,420
Hey, fellas.

63
00:04:19,223 --> 00:04:20,322
Special Agent Lance Sterling.

64
00:04:20,324 --> 00:04:21,389
How you livin'?

65
00:04:23,028 --> 00:04:24,963
Whoa, okay, okay.

66
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:26,928
Everybody good?

67
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,331
I'm just gonna
take his gun

68
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:30,000
and I'm gonna toss it
to that snowman.

69
00:04:30,002 --> 00:04:32,101
And while you're both
looking all confused,

70
00:04:32,103 --> 00:04:33,334
trying to figure out
what's going on...

71
00:04:33,336 --> 00:04:35,539
- I'm just gonna knock you out.
- Huh?

72
00:04:41,478 --> 00:04:42,844
Ugh.

73
00:04:42,846 --> 00:04:44,282
He didn't deserve that.

74
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:47,518
Rats with wings.

75
00:04:51,122 --> 00:04:52,320
<i>I'm in position.</i>

76
00:04:52,322 --> 00:04:53,959
What is your situation?

77
00:04:55,892 --> 00:04:58,161
Just getting a visual...

78
00:04:58,163 --> 00:04:59,430
now.

79
00:05:05,502 --> 00:05:07,503
<i>10 o'clock.</i>

80
00:05:07,505 --> 00:05:09,272
Katsu Kimura.

81
00:05:09,274 --> 00:05:11,106
Everybody's favorite
arms dealer.

82
00:05:11,108 --> 00:05:14,110
<i>There.
That briefcase is your objective.</i>

83
00:05:14,112 --> 00:05:16,279
Inside is the M9 Assassin.

84
00:05:16,281 --> 00:05:18,380
The first semi-autonomous
attack drone,

85
00:05:18,382 --> 00:05:20,382
powered by
atmospheric energy.

86
00:05:20,384 --> 00:05:21,550
<i>Never shuts down,</i>

87
00:05:21,552 --> 00:05:23,685
<i>never stops pursuing
its target.</i>

88
00:05:23,687 --> 00:05:26,022
They stole it
from our covert weapons lab.

89
00:05:26,024 --> 00:05:27,990
Uh, Director Jenkins,

90
00:05:27,992 --> 00:05:29,091
he's got incoming.

91
00:05:29,093 --> 00:05:32,361
Detecting 70 extra hostiles
around the perimeter.

92
00:05:32,363 --> 00:05:34,964
I don't want
another mess like Kyrgyzstan.

93
00:05:34,966 --> 00:05:38,034
Lance, listen to me.
You've got 70 yakuza incoming.

94
00:05:38,036 --> 00:05:39,334
Stand down.

95
00:05:39,336 --> 00:05:41,336
<i>That's better
odds than I usually get.</i>

96
00:05:41,338 --> 00:05:42,872
No! Do not engage.

97
00:05:42,874 --> 00:05:45,074
This time, you need to wait
for the backup team.

98
00:05:45,076 --> 00:05:46,878
<i>Team?</i>

99
00:05:47,978 --> 00:05:49,045
I fly solo.

100
00:05:49,047 --> 00:05:50,749
Wait. Lance, listen to...

101
00:05:52,684 --> 00:05:56,017
I think he cut off...

102
00:05:56,019 --> 00:05:56,918
- I get it!
- Yeah, great,

103
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,353
that's right. Sorry.

104
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:22,255
The buyer is here. Go!

105
00:06:23,281 --> 00:06:24,583
Huh.

106
00:06:49,206 --> 00:06:50,805
Uh-oh.

107
00:06:50,807 --> 00:06:53,043
Guess it's time
to introduce myself.

108
00:06:58,249 --> 00:07:00,048
Huh?

109
00:07:23,406 --> 00:07:24,539
You know
how you can tell

110
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:26,341
when you're the world's
greatest spy?

111
00:07:26,343 --> 00:07:28,844
Sterling.

112
00:07:28,846 --> 00:07:30,378
Lance Sterling.

113
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,982
Everyone knows the name.

114
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:33,785
I'mma need that case.

115
00:07:34,856 --> 00:07:37,185
Over my dead body.

116
00:07:43,694 --> 00:07:47,363
Just 3 ounces of
pressure to the vagus nerve...

117
00:07:47,365 --> 00:07:48,897
and then look at your boy.

118
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:50,500
Sleepy night-night.

119
00:07:50,502 --> 00:07:52,504
Hey, you mind
giving me a hand?

120
00:07:56,874 --> 00:07:58,307
Hey, come on.

121
00:07:58,309 --> 00:07:59,845
What was it?
The hand joke?

122
00:08:10,387 --> 00:08:12,690
You don't remember me,
do you?

123
00:08:13,723 --> 00:08:15,860
What can I say?
I meet a lot of bad guys.

124
00:08:17,262 --> 00:08:21,500
I'm gonna show you pain
that you can't imagine.

125
00:08:40,418 --> 00:08:42,785
Make it hurt.

126
00:08:42,787 --> 00:08:46,124
I don't think

127
00:08:48,092 --> 00:08:50,694
Okay. Oh, okay.

128
00:08:51,729 --> 00:08:54,563
You wanna do it the hard way?
Let's go, then.

129
00:08:54,565 --> 00:08:56,067
Let's do it
the hard way.

130
00:09:02,306 --> 00:09:03,775
It's about to get messy.

131
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,615
Aw.

132
00:09:12,283 --> 00:09:13,618
What the...

133
00:09:41,078 --> 00:09:42,244
Ooh.

134
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,387
Hey, don't take
the loss so hard.

135
00:09:51,389 --> 00:09:52,521
I mean,
you did great.

136
00:09:52,523 --> 00:09:54,024
And you got to meet
Lance Sterling.

137
00:12:29,346 --> 00:12:32,314
Next. Okay,
put everything in the bin.

138
00:12:32,316 --> 00:12:34,049
Yes, come through.

139
00:12:34,051 --> 00:12:36,551
- Oh! He's coming.
- Wow. Here he comes!

140
00:12:36,553 --> 00:12:37,786
Yes,

141
00:12:37,788 --> 00:12:39,254
your eyes
aren't deceiving you.

142
00:12:39,256 --> 00:12:40,488
Yep, it's him.

143
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:41,623
Thank you, thank you.

144
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:42,824
Looking good,
Agent Sterling!

145
00:12:42,826 --> 00:12:45,094
Hey, not looking
so bad yourself.

146
00:12:45,096 --> 00:12:46,195
Thank you. Thank you.

147
00:12:46,197 --> 00:12:47,996
Yeah, you know what?
Go ahead back to work.

148
00:12:47,998 --> 00:12:50,699
Go ahead back to work.
It's too much.

149
00:12:50,701 --> 00:12:51,999
It's probably
the right amount.

150
00:12:52,001 --> 00:12:53,301
But still go back to work.

151
00:12:53,303 --> 00:12:54,369
Still go back to work.

152
00:12:54,371 --> 00:12:56,006
You're so crazy.

153
00:12:57,341 --> 00:12:58,406
What's up, Sterling?

154
00:12:58,408 --> 00:12:59,541
Lucas!

155
00:12:59,543 --> 00:13:00,709
My name's Dave.

156
00:13:00,711 --> 00:13:03,512
There you go.
Good to see you.

157
00:13:03,514 --> 00:13:04,579
Morning, sir.

158
00:13:04,581 --> 00:13:06,015
Fellas, give it to me.

159
00:13:06,017 --> 00:13:08,316
- Dude, did you see that?
- Never wash that hand again.

160
00:13:08,318 --> 00:13:10,953
I feel stronger.
Like, I legit feel stronger.

161
00:13:10,955 --> 00:13:12,521
- Can I hold it?
- Yeah.

162
00:13:12,523 --> 00:13:14,323
- Dude from Accounting.
- Thanks for the win, Sterling.

163
00:13:14,325 --> 00:13:16,624
Keep my money right.
Keep my money right.

164
00:13:16,626 --> 00:13:17,792
Go ahead, man.
All right.

165
00:13:17,794 --> 00:13:18,893
Hey,
welcome back, Lance.

166
00:13:18,895 --> 00:13:20,130
Thank you,
thank you.

167
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:26,100
Aw, he's the most
adorable agent ever!

168
00:13:26,102 --> 00:13:27,404
Somebody gonna get it.

169
00:13:54,932 --> 00:13:56,433
Oh! Agent Sterling.

170
00:13:59,571 --> 00:14:00,701
Walter Beckett.

171
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,804
Weirdo.

172
00:14:02,907 --> 00:14:04,138
<i>Unitee loves you.</i>

173
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,775
All right, Unitee.

174
00:14:05,777 --> 00:14:07,242
Imagine...

175
00:14:07,244 --> 00:14:11,647
a hydrothermal explosion is
about to melt your face off.

176
00:14:11,649 --> 00:14:13,080
But what's this?

177
00:14:13,082 --> 00:14:14,983
A gadget that can surround
you in a pressurized pocket

178
00:14:14,985 --> 00:14:16,251
of safety?

179
00:14:16,253 --> 00:14:18,753
"Can it work?"
It hasn't yet, but maybe.

180
00:14:18,755 --> 00:14:19,821
Here we go.

181
00:14:19,823 --> 00:14:21,959
Session number nine,
test 30... Oh!

182
00:14:22,659 --> 00:14:23,993
Oh, hey, Terrance.

183
00:14:23,995 --> 00:14:26,528
Tonight's the season finale
of <i>Hearts in Seoul.</i>

184
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:27,696
I sent you an e-vite.

185
00:14:27,698 --> 00:14:29,698
I, uh...

186
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,369
You just click "accept"
in your...

187
00:14:31,836 --> 00:14:33,267
Agent Sterling.

188
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:36,070
Uh... Hi, wow.
Uh, Walter Beckett.

189
00:14:36,072 --> 00:14:37,274
Pleasure to meet...

190
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,440
Aw.

191
00:14:39,442 --> 00:14:40,608
You used it.

192
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:43,145
You touched my stuff.

193
00:14:43,147 --> 00:14:46,080
Okay, okay. Look, I know
it's non-traditional, but...

194
00:14:46,082 --> 00:14:47,449
Feel me here, little man.

195
00:14:47,451 --> 00:14:48,917
So, I'm out there...

196
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:51,118
and I'm saving the world,
doing big things.

197
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,521
- That's what I do.
- Mmm-hmm.

198
00:14:52,523 --> 00:14:54,323
And the way I do it...

199
00:14:54,325 --> 00:14:56,023
is to have my things

200
00:14:56,025 --> 00:14:58,759
do the things
I expect my things to do.

201
00:14:58,761 --> 00:14:59,962
Yep. Ow.

202
00:14:59,964 --> 00:15:02,897
Like blow stuff up.

203
00:15:02,899 --> 00:15:04,366
See, out there...

204
00:15:04,368 --> 00:15:07,902
I gotta fight
fire with fire.

205
00:15:07,904 --> 00:15:11,341
Because if I try to fight
fire with glitter...

206
00:15:12,644 --> 00:15:15,312
I could get my face
burned off.

207
00:15:15,745 --> 00:15:16,945
But you didn't.

208
00:15:16,947 --> 00:15:18,713
Because the kitty glitter
worked.

209
00:15:18,715 --> 00:15:20,016
- Kitty litter?
- Glitter.

210
00:15:20,018 --> 00:15:21,650
Kitty glitter.

211
00:15:21,652 --> 00:15:23,953
It's scientifically proven
that watching kittens...

212
00:15:23,955 --> 00:15:25,921
causes the
enterochromaffin cells

213
00:15:25,923 --> 00:15:27,125
to release serotonin.

214
00:15:29,693 --> 00:15:31,059
Glitter makes people happy.

215
00:15:31,061 --> 00:15:33,595
Know what works
even better?

216
00:15:33,597 --> 00:15:35,162
A grenade.

217
00:15:35,164 --> 00:15:36,998
It's kinda violent,
don't you think?

218
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,934
Can't save the world
with a hug, Wilson.

219
00:15:38,936 --> 00:15:40,935
It's Walter.

220
00:15:40,937 --> 00:15:42,970
And what if you could?

221
00:15:42,972 --> 00:15:44,474
The inflatable hug.

222
00:15:46,143 --> 00:15:49,681
Kind of a personal protection
device I've been developing.

223
00:15:58,455 --> 00:16:02,491
This is a vile
waste of taxpayer dollars.

224
00:16:05,395 --> 00:16:07,429
Look, I'm just saying
you can do more

225
00:16:07,431 --> 00:16:09,198
by bringing
people together...

226
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,598
than blowing them up.

227
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,133
And if I can
convince you,

228
00:16:12,135 --> 00:16:14,169
we can convince
the whole agency.

229
00:16:14,171 --> 00:16:15,804
There is no "we."

230
00:16:15,806 --> 00:16:16,972
Uh, Agent Sterling.
Just...

231
00:16:16,974 --> 00:16:18,640
- Okay. Okay, okay.
- Millennials.

232
00:16:18,642 --> 00:16:20,208
No, wait, wait, wait.
Please don't close that door.

233
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:21,309
Not interested.

234
00:16:21,311 --> 00:16:22,377
Listen, you gotta
hear me out.

235
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:24,148
Whatever it is, no.

236
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,249
Phew. Look, I've been working

237
00:16:28,251 --> 00:16:29,350
on this thing
at home, right...

238
00:16:29,352 --> 00:16:32,356
that is gonna change
spying forever.

239
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,222
Imagine...

240
00:16:34,224 --> 00:16:36,459
if I could make you,
wait for it...

241
00:16:36,461 --> 00:16:37,662
drumroll, please...

242
00:16:38,294 --> 00:16:40,863
disappear.

243
00:16:40,865 --> 00:16:41,930
Disappear?

244
00:16:41,932 --> 00:16:42,998
Yeah.

245
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,668
Disappear.

246
00:16:45,369 --> 00:16:46,800
Why are you saying it
like that?

247
00:16:46,802 --> 00:16:49,774
For effect.

248
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:53,175
I'm totally
excited about it.

249
00:16:53,177 --> 00:16:54,276
It's called

250
00:16:54,278 --> 00:16:56,344
bio-dynamic concealment.

251
00:16:56,346 --> 00:16:58,113
Boom. Mic drop.

252
00:16:58,115 --> 00:17:00,382
Huh? Conceal this?

253
00:17:01,585 --> 00:17:03,151
I mean, you wouldn't
need a bulletproof suit.

254
00:17:03,153 --> 00:17:04,552
You wouldn't need
exploding cufflinks.

255
00:17:04,554 --> 00:17:06,388
You could blend in anywhere.

256
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:08,426
What if you were totally...

257
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,029
...invisible?

258
00:17:13,431 --> 00:17:14,963
Wow. Dude.

259
00:17:14,965 --> 00:17:16,865
That's a mess.

260
00:17:16,867 --> 00:17:18,333
Don't worry yourself.

261
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:20,335
The effects,
they're only temporary.

262
00:17:20,337 --> 00:17:22,904
All right, cool, cool.
I'm gonna get outta here.

263
00:17:22,906 --> 00:17:24,274
Wait, wait, wait.

264
00:17:25,576 --> 00:17:29,044
Look,
you're the world's greatest spy.

265
00:17:29,046 --> 00:17:31,112
Nobody ever listens
to my ideas

266
00:17:31,114 --> 00:17:33,148
or gives me a chance...

267
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,383
but if you did...

268
00:17:35,385 --> 00:17:36,386
together...

269
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,157
we could really
make a difference.

270
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,157
"Make a difference"?

271
00:17:42,159 --> 00:17:45,193
Boy, I am the difference.

272
00:17:45,195 --> 00:17:48,830
All I need from you
is when I want a grenade...

273
00:17:48,832 --> 00:17:50,798
make me a grenade.

274
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,802
Can you do that?

275
00:17:53,537 --> 00:17:55,640
There's a better way.

276
00:17:56,573 --> 00:17:57,706
Wrong answer, Willy.

277
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:59,708
You're fired.

278
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:01,110
What? Wait.

279
00:18:01,112 --> 00:18:03,514
No, no, no.
Uh, please don't fire me!

280
00:18:10,688 --> 00:18:12,156
Weirdo.

281
00:18:15,792 --> 00:18:17,492
Mission accomplished.

282
00:18:17,494 --> 00:18:20,629
Oh, man, I'm telling you,
it was one of my best.

283
00:18:20,631 --> 00:18:22,430
I was on fire.

284
00:18:22,432 --> 00:18:26,535
Fighting, explosions,
tons of witty catchphrases.

285
00:18:26,537 --> 00:18:27,401
Lance?

286
00:18:27,403 --> 00:18:30,639
I had to jump
through a helicopter.

287
00:18:30,641 --> 00:18:31,873
Lance?

288
00:18:33,376 --> 00:18:34,843
- Right?
- Lance!

289
00:18:34,845 --> 00:18:36,378
- Hmm?
- Please tell me

290
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:39,317
you have an explanation
for why this is empty.

291
00:18:40,951 --> 00:18:42,153
I know why.

292
00:18:42,853 --> 00:18:44,084
Because he stole it.

293
00:18:44,086 --> 00:18:45,353
Excuse me?

294
00:18:45,355 --> 00:18:47,623
Agent Marcy Kappel,
Internal Affairs.

295
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:49,658
Mind if my team
sweeps the room?

296
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,859
Yes, I mind.

297
00:18:50,861 --> 00:18:52,161
They call me Eyes.

298
00:18:52,163 --> 00:18:54,962
Spectral analysis and
quantum optical thermography.

299
00:18:54,964 --> 00:18:56,833
Ears. Sound.

300
00:18:57,101 --> 00:18:58,400
Okay.

301
00:18:58,402 --> 00:19:01,139
Hey, y'all need to ease out
of my face right now.

302
00:19:01,538 --> 00:19:02,504
Whoa! Hey.

303
00:19:02,506 --> 00:19:05,039
Weapons deactivated.
Backing up.

304
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:06,841
Take Agent Sterling
into custody.

305
00:19:06,843 --> 00:19:08,343
All right, enough!

306
00:19:08,345 --> 00:19:11,246
We're talking about
my top agent here.

307
00:19:11,248 --> 00:19:12,850
I trust this man.

308
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:17,518
The only thing we can trust
is the facts.

309
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,952
Eyes?

310
00:19:18,954 --> 00:19:20,588
A surveillance camera
in Tokyo

311
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:22,526
picked this up two hours
after your mission.

312
00:19:26,029 --> 00:19:27,431
<i>Stop right there.</i>

313
00:19:40,711 --> 00:19:42,076
- Lance?
- Joy.

314
00:19:42,078 --> 00:19:43,378
His heart rate
just spiked.

315
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,880
That's because
it isn't me.

316
00:19:44,882 --> 00:19:46,414
Vocal patterns
is all off the hook.

317
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:47,548
This has to be wrong.

318
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:49,683
This is wrong!
I didn't...

319
00:19:49,685 --> 00:19:52,921
Look, there was a guy
with a robot hand.

320
00:19:52,923 --> 00:19:54,288
He stole the Assassin,

321
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:56,691
and he scanned my face
to frame me.

322
00:19:56,693 --> 00:19:58,125
That sounds plausible,

323
00:19:58,127 --> 00:20:00,027
and not like something
you just made up.

324
00:20:00,029 --> 00:20:01,696
Sounds a little
Scooby-Doo, bro.

325
00:20:01,698 --> 00:20:02,564
It isn't me!

326
00:20:02,566 --> 00:20:04,665
Okay, so,
just to be clear...

327
00:20:04,667 --> 00:20:08,236
there's a man with a robot
hand and Lance's face

328
00:20:08,238 --> 00:20:10,271
who took the M9 Assassin.

329
00:20:10,273 --> 00:20:11,440
We all feel good
about that?

330
00:20:11,442 --> 00:20:13,310
Okay, case closed.
Let's go home.

331
00:20:14,311 --> 00:20:15,410
You know what?

332
00:20:15,412 --> 00:20:16,577
There's a bad guy

333
00:20:16,579 --> 00:20:18,747
who needs to be stopped.

334
00:20:18,749 --> 00:20:20,882
Couldn't agree more.

335
00:20:20,884 --> 00:20:22,784
Huh. You're good.

336
00:20:22,786 --> 00:20:25,019
Lance, just cooperate.

337
00:20:25,021 --> 00:20:26,955
Didn't see that coming,
did you?

338
00:20:26,957 --> 00:20:28,590
Did you see that coming?

339
00:20:32,596 --> 00:20:34,832
He's running.
Why do they always run?

340
00:20:38,568 --> 00:20:40,468
Off to save the world again?

341
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:42,069
Uh, yeah, you, too.
You, too.

342
00:20:42,071 --> 00:20:44,405
- 'Sup, Sterling?
- All good, all good.

343
00:20:44,407 --> 00:20:46,040
Sorry.

344
00:20:46,042 --> 00:20:47,811
Sterling!

345
00:20:48,913 --> 00:20:49,812
Now.

346
00:20:49,814 --> 00:20:51,144
<i>Northwest corner.</i>

347
00:20:51,146 --> 00:20:52,349
Got him.

348
00:20:57,688 --> 00:20:58,889
Coming through,
coming through.

349
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:03,793
Security!

350
00:21:04,461 --> 00:21:06,362
Shut this place down!

351
00:21:06,364 --> 00:21:07,428
Agent Sterling?

352
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:08,863
I would do what she says.

353
00:21:08,865 --> 00:21:10,800
She is very unpleasant.

354
00:22:03,287 --> 00:22:04,952
Agent Sterling!
What's happening, man?

355
00:22:04,954 --> 00:22:07,490
I was just telling the guys
about the time you...

356
00:22:22,006 --> 00:22:23,341
All right, Sterling.

357
00:22:24,807 --> 00:22:25,942
Think.

358
00:22:26,576 --> 00:22:27,611
Think.

359
00:22:28,746 --> 00:22:31,816
Somebody else knows
about Robot Hand.

360
00:22:32,214 --> 00:22:34,451
Who?

361
00:22:37,421 --> 00:22:38,622
<i>Kimura.</i>

362
00:22:39,823 --> 00:22:41,556
Find Kimura.

363
00:22:41,558 --> 00:22:43,558
<i>Tracking Katsu Kimura.</i>

364
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,795
<i>Wireless signal intercepted
in Playa Del Carmen, Mexico.</i>

365
00:22:46,797 --> 00:22:48,096
<i>You shouldn't be
calling me.</i>

366
00:22:48,098 --> 00:22:49,162
Mexico.

367
00:22:49,164 --> 00:22:50,297
<i>I'm trying to lay low!</i>

368
00:22:53,938 --> 00:22:55,539
I need to disappear.

369
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:59,877
Disappear.

370
00:23:03,646 --> 00:23:04,746
Bingo.

371
00:23:04,748 --> 00:23:06,851
Hope you got
your pants on, Wilbur.

372
00:23:24,034 --> 00:23:25,836
<i>Unitee.</i>

373
00:23:28,672 --> 00:23:30,841
I miss you, Mom.

374
00:24:10,314 --> 00:24:11,479
See, Lovey?

375
00:24:11,481 --> 00:24:13,548
Some dreams do come true.

376
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:15,019
Oh, um...

377
00:24:17,288 --> 00:24:18,756
Okay.

378
00:24:32,868 --> 00:24:35,437
Commencing bio-dynamic
concealment

379
00:24:35,439 --> 00:24:37,908
test number 83,
batch five.

380
00:24:40,277 --> 00:24:43,276
Exothermic reaction.

381
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:44,845
That's an exothermic reaction.

382
00:24:44,847 --> 00:24:48,048
Uh, Lovey, could I borrow
a feather, please?

383
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:49,651
Thank you.

384
00:24:49,653 --> 00:24:51,318
Here's a little something
for you.

385
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,562
If this works,

386
00:25:00,564 --> 00:25:02,633
they'll have to
give me my job back.

387
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,877
No way. It worked.

388
00:25:14,544 --> 00:25:15,710
It worked.

389
00:25:15,712 --> 00:25:17,312
It worked! It worked!
It worked!

390
00:25:17,314 --> 00:25:18,513
Lovey, it worked!
It worked!

391
00:25:18,515 --> 00:25:19,780
I need to disappear.

392
00:25:22,484 --> 00:25:23,785
What... How did you...

393
00:25:23,787 --> 00:25:25,487
What are you doing in my...

394
00:25:25,489 --> 00:25:26,622
What's up?

395
00:25:26,624 --> 00:25:27,756
Okay, listen.

396
00:25:27,758 --> 00:25:29,658
That next-generation
concealment tech

397
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,026
you were
talking about earlier...

398
00:25:31,028 --> 00:25:33,694
you wouldn't happen to have it on
hand, would you?

399
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:36,564
Actually, I do happen
to have it in hand.

400
00:25:36,566 --> 00:25:38,600
- Show it to me.
- Sure. Um...

401
00:25:38,602 --> 00:25:39,834
Well, can I
offer you a drink?

402
00:25:39,836 --> 00:25:40,901
I got water,

403
00:25:40,903 --> 00:25:42,804
Soylent drinkable
meal replacement...

404
00:25:42,806 --> 00:25:44,706
Mmm. Good.
We had a drink.

405
00:25:44,708 --> 00:25:46,007
So, what are we
talking about here?

406
00:25:46,009 --> 00:25:47,676
Light-bending camo suit?

407
00:25:47,678 --> 00:25:49,811
Adaptive response silicon...

408
00:25:49,813 --> 00:25:52,447
Diet stuff
has a weird aftertaste.

409
00:25:52,449 --> 00:25:53,613
What's the tech?

410
00:25:53,615 --> 00:25:57,518
Um... Well,
you just drank it.

411
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,321
- Drank what?
- The tech.

412
00:25:59,323 --> 00:26:01,555
Now it's gone. Yep.

413
00:26:01,557 --> 00:26:03,257
Why do you have
a pigeon in here?

414
00:26:03,259 --> 00:26:06,594
Yeah, okay, that's just Lovey.
She's my roommate.

415
00:26:06,596 --> 00:26:07,728
- How am I gonna do this?
- Um, that's weird.

416
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:08,830
This is bad.
No, it's not.

417
00:26:08,832 --> 00:26:10,097
To have a pigeon
in your house.

418
00:26:10,099 --> 00:26:10,965
It's amazing.

419
00:26:10,967 --> 00:26:12,933
It's science. Here we go.

420
00:26:12,935 --> 00:26:14,969
You just drank
an ingestible formula

421
00:26:14,971 --> 00:26:16,738
that uses a CRISPR-Cas9
genetic editor...

422
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:19,274
to resequence your DNA
on a molecular level.

423
00:26:19,276 --> 00:26:21,709
Science rocks.

424
00:26:21,711 --> 00:26:24,444
Wow! Okay, here's
what I need you to do.

425
00:26:24,446 --> 00:26:26,514
Pretend like
you're a normal person

426
00:26:26,516 --> 00:26:28,783
talking to a much cooler
normal person.

427
00:26:28,785 --> 00:26:31,686
In precisely 45 seconds,

428
00:26:31,688 --> 00:26:33,624
you will transform into...

429
00:26:34,124 --> 00:26:35,125
a pigeon.

430
00:26:45,234 --> 00:26:46,235
I'm out.

431
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:47,902
Wait, wait, wait.

432
00:26:47,904 --> 00:26:49,171
What you're about
to experience

433
00:26:49,173 --> 00:26:50,604
is the future of espionage.

434
00:26:50,606 --> 00:26:51,805
Okay.

435
00:26:51,807 --> 00:26:54,776
You might be experiencing
some mild discomfort.

436
00:26:54,778 --> 00:26:57,045
Or severe.

437
00:26:57,047 --> 00:26:58,546
I'll make a note of that.

438
00:26:58,548 --> 00:27:00,148
This is because
I fired you, right?

439
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:03,450
Okay, I'm gonna walk
outta here.

440
00:27:03,452 --> 00:27:04,852
Yeah, that might be hard.

441
00:27:04,854 --> 00:27:08,292
Because you're in the middle
of chromothripsis.

442
00:27:09,192 --> 00:27:10,892
Okay, might pass out.

443
00:27:10,894 --> 00:27:13,061
Oh, you're definitely
gonna pass out.

444
00:27:13,063 --> 00:27:15,595
Your genomes
are being smashed apart...

445
00:27:15,597 --> 00:27:17,699
so they can be reassembled
with pigeon DNA.

446
00:27:17,701 --> 00:27:20,367
Muscle it down, Lance.

447
00:27:20,369 --> 00:27:21,769
Muscle it down.

448
00:27:21,771 --> 00:27:24,838
Oh! What did you do?
What did you do?

449
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,807
Whoa.
You're entering Phase Two.

450
00:27:26,809 --> 00:27:29,110
Epigenetic modulation.

451
00:27:29,112 --> 00:27:30,879
Think of each gene
as having a switch.

452
00:27:30,881 --> 00:27:33,613
And one by one, your switches
are flipping to pigeon.

453
00:27:33,615 --> 00:27:36,150
Human-pigeon, human-pigeon,
human-pigeon.

454
00:27:36,152 --> 00:27:38,885
Human-pigeon,
human-pigeon, human-pigeon.

455
00:27:38,887 --> 00:27:41,221
Stop with the lights!

456
00:27:41,223 --> 00:27:42,856
Wait, look at my hand!

457
00:27:42,858 --> 00:27:46,327
What's happening
to my hand?

458
00:27:46,329 --> 00:27:47,562
Baby hand.

459
00:27:47,564 --> 00:27:49,867
This is the final phase!

460
00:27:53,936 --> 00:27:56,938
This isn't so bad.

461
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,840
Your body is
being flooded with endorphins

462
00:27:58,842 --> 00:28:00,642
to prepare you
for the immense physical pain

463
00:28:00,644 --> 00:28:02,776
you're about to experience.

464
00:28:02,778 --> 00:28:05,212
Wait. Say that again.

465
00:28:08,152 --> 00:28:10,019
You poisoned me!

466
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,552
"Poisoned"?

467
00:28:11,554 --> 00:28:13,421
That's not even
my department.

468
00:28:13,423 --> 00:28:15,159
Squeeze the poison out.

469
00:28:17,627 --> 00:28:19,561
I wouldn't do that.

470
00:28:19,563 --> 00:28:20,728
Three seconds.

471
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:23,096
You're gonna be fine.
Trust me.

472
00:28:23,098 --> 00:28:24,699
Here we go.

473
00:28:27,304 --> 00:28:28,372
Hmm?

474
00:28:29,173 --> 00:28:30,671
- Ha!
- What?

475
00:28:32,142 --> 00:28:34,178
Whoa. That clock's fast.

476
00:28:38,515 --> 00:28:39,850
Lance?

477
00:28:41,483 --> 00:28:42,485
Lance.

478
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,552
It worked.

479
00:28:44,554 --> 00:28:46,054
Subject's vitals are stable.

480
00:28:46,056 --> 00:28:49,293
Inserting rectal thermometer.

481
00:28:52,595 --> 00:28:54,731
It's okay, buddy.

482
00:28:55,632 --> 00:28:57,664
Hey, it's okay.
Don't you worry.

483
00:28:57,666 --> 00:28:59,366
Your good friend Walter
is here.

484
00:29:07,678 --> 00:29:10,180
Subject appears disoriented.

485
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,813
Of course I'm disoriented.

486
00:29:12,815 --> 00:29:13,914
You can talk?

487
00:29:13,916 --> 00:29:15,482
Lovey, he can talk!

488
00:29:15,484 --> 00:29:16,584
- It worked.
- My eyes!

489
00:29:16,586 --> 00:29:17,684
It worked.
Can you believe this?

490
00:29:17,686 --> 00:29:18,753
What did you do
to my eyes?

491
00:29:18,755 --> 00:29:20,520
- Hey, Lance, look at me.
- What did...

492
00:29:20,522 --> 00:29:21,690
Look at you?

493
00:29:21,692 --> 00:29:24,258
I can't not
look at you, Walter.

494
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:27,929
I can see my butt and your
face at the same time!

495
00:29:27,931 --> 00:29:29,330
That is so cool!

496
00:29:29,332 --> 00:29:32,033
Fact, pigeons have
360-degree vision.

497
00:29:32,035 --> 00:29:33,834
Now, nobody can sneak up
behind you.

498
00:29:33,836 --> 00:29:35,603
- Stop, girl. Come on.
- This is so great.

499
00:29:35,605 --> 00:29:38,706
Pigeons can be found in every
major city around the world...

500
00:29:38,708 --> 00:29:39,940
and no one notices them.

501
00:29:39,942 --> 00:29:42,075
It's the most perfect form
a spy could take.

502
00:29:42,077 --> 00:29:44,911
You better un-bird me
right now.

503
00:29:44,913 --> 00:29:47,315
That's it. I'm not playing
with you. Un-bird...

504
00:29:47,317 --> 00:29:48,315
I'm raising my voice.

505
00:29:48,317 --> 00:29:50,684
I probably shouldn't be
raising my voice at you.

506
00:29:50,686 --> 00:29:51,920
I guess you could imagine

507
00:29:51,922 --> 00:29:53,188
I'm a little stressed
right now.

508
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:55,489
I need you
to un-bird me, Walter.

509
00:29:55,491 --> 00:29:56,490
Mmm-hmm.
Of course.

510
00:29:56,492 --> 00:29:58,392
I'll start working
on an antidote right now.

511
00:29:58,394 --> 00:29:59,594
Start?

512
00:29:59,596 --> 00:30:01,062
Well, the formula was purely
theoretical until you...

513
00:30:01,064 --> 00:30:03,765
You're gonna start?
You don't have an antidote?

514
00:30:03,767 --> 00:30:05,600
Stop, girl, seriously.

515
00:30:05,602 --> 00:30:06,834
Okay, okay.

516
00:30:06,836 --> 00:30:09,336
So, you birded me,
and you can't un-bird me.

517
00:30:09,338 --> 00:30:12,239
Technically, you kind of
birded yourself.

518
00:30:12,241 --> 00:30:14,007
I'mma hurt this boy.

519
00:30:14,009 --> 00:30:15,176
- I'mma hurt this boy.
- No, no, look.

520
00:30:15,178 --> 00:30:16,943
I know you're upset,
but everything's okay.

521
00:30:16,945 --> 00:30:18,680
I called the Agency
and told them you're here.

522
00:30:18,682 --> 00:30:19,814
You did what?

523
00:30:19,816 --> 00:30:20,915
No, no, no, it's okay.

524
00:30:20,917 --> 00:30:21,981
I didn't tell them
you're a bird.

525
00:30:21,983 --> 00:30:23,150
Although I think
they're gonna

526
00:30:23,152 --> 00:30:24,951
figure that out
pretty quickly.

527
00:30:24,953 --> 00:30:26,823
I gotta ghost.

528
00:30:28,525 --> 00:30:32,559
Yeah, there may be one or two
downsides to your new form.

529
00:30:32,561 --> 00:30:35,263
Webster, open the door.

530
00:30:35,265 --> 00:30:37,132
Okay. Okay.

531
00:30:37,134 --> 00:30:39,267
What... Why are you running
from the Agency?

532
00:30:39,269 --> 00:30:41,402
Get off me!
I'm running...

533
00:30:41,404 --> 00:30:43,904
because there's a bad guy
out there with my face...

534
00:30:43,906 --> 00:30:45,271
and now I have to try
to stop him

535
00:30:45,273 --> 00:30:47,574
from hurting people
while being a bird.

536
00:30:47,576 --> 00:30:50,143
And thank you for that.
Thank you very much for that.

537
00:30:50,145 --> 00:30:52,449
You know what?
You're fired again.

538
00:30:52,815 --> 00:30:54,015
Double fired!

539
00:30:54,017 --> 00:30:55,917
Mmm, I don't think
that's a thing.

540
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:58,486
Oh, it's a thing.
It's a thing now.

541
00:31:05,862 --> 00:31:07,594
Okay.

542
00:31:07,596 --> 00:31:08,895
It's a wingsuit.

543
00:31:08,897 --> 00:31:10,297
How hard could it be?

544
00:31:12,335 --> 00:31:14,037
Time to fly.

545
00:31:16,573 --> 00:31:17,738
Nope.

546
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:20,007
You broke into the Kremlin
using a napkin

547
00:31:20,009 --> 00:31:21,476
and a piece of duct tape.

548
00:31:21,478 --> 00:31:25,912
You should be able
to get into your own car!

549
00:31:31,954 --> 00:31:34,221
Yep, yep, yep.

550
00:31:35,724 --> 00:31:38,526
Got it, got it,
got it... Ow!

551
00:31:38,528 --> 00:31:39,528
Come on.

552
00:31:44,634 --> 00:31:47,267
Okay,
hear me out.

553
00:31:47,269 --> 00:31:49,203
Is somebody talking?
I don't hear anybody talking.

554
00:31:49,205 --> 00:31:51,538
Especially somebody
that's been double fired...

555
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,907
working on a triple fire.

556
00:31:52,909 --> 00:31:54,275
I'll come with you.

557
00:31:54,277 --> 00:31:56,210
I can show you all the
advantages of being a pigeon

558
00:31:56,212 --> 00:31:58,446
and how it can make you
an even better spy.

559
00:31:58,448 --> 00:32:00,614
And then you'll give me
my job back.

560
00:32:00,616 --> 00:32:01,915
We both win.

561
00:32:01,917 --> 00:32:03,718
All right,
let me think about that.

562
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,153
No.

563
00:32:06,155 --> 00:32:08,422
Okay. Well,
I suppose you have somebody else

564
00:32:08,424 --> 00:32:09,492
who has a mobile lab...

565
00:32:10,259 --> 00:32:12,162
who could turn you back
into a man.

566
00:32:13,762 --> 00:32:15,698
- Get in the car.
- You won't even know I'm here.

567
00:32:24,207 --> 00:32:25,840
I'll just ride out here,
don't worry.

568
00:32:25,842 --> 00:32:27,807
Oh, right. My bad.

569
00:32:29,345 --> 00:32:31,312
Go, go, go!
Moving through.

570
00:32:31,314 --> 00:32:32,780
I want that tree gone, now!

571
00:32:32,782 --> 00:32:33,948
<i>Agent Sterling,</i>

572
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:35,149
<i>exit the premises now!</i>

573
00:32:35,151 --> 00:32:37,051
What are you doing?
Get in the car!

574
00:32:37,053 --> 00:32:38,219
Holy...

575
00:32:38,221 --> 00:32:40,054
Wilfred! Let's move!

576
00:32:40,056 --> 00:32:41,525
Let's go, go, go!

577
00:32:42,557 --> 00:32:44,159
Activate auto-drive.

578
00:32:44,161 --> 00:32:45,825
<i>Auto-drive engaged.</i>

579
00:32:45,827 --> 00:32:47,631
Sterling private jet hangar.

580
00:32:48,097 --> 00:32:49,463
See that, Walter?

581
00:32:49,465 --> 00:32:50,998
You can bird me...

582
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,767
but you can't stop me.

583
00:32:56,137 --> 00:32:58,105
He was behind us.

584
00:32:58,107 --> 00:32:59,407
Buckle up. And get me

585
00:32:59,409 --> 00:33:01,208
everything we can
on that Beckett kid.

586
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:02,642
You think
they're working together?

587
00:33:02,644 --> 00:33:05,112
Sterling works alone.
He's using him for something.

588
00:33:12,087 --> 00:33:13,755
You brought the lady bird?

589
00:33:13,757 --> 00:33:15,488
She's my emotional
support animal.

590
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:18,258
You're gonna need
a life support animal

591
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,559
if that bird poop in my...

592
00:33:19,561 --> 00:33:22,497
We got company.

593
00:33:22,499 --> 00:33:24,199
We've got units
blocking every street,

594
00:33:24,201 --> 00:33:26,734
overpass, and exit
within a 5-mile radius.

595
00:33:26,736 --> 00:33:29,437
Perfect.
Time for a cattle drive.

596
00:33:29,439 --> 00:33:30,638
Saddle up!

597
00:33:32,275 --> 00:33:34,408
<i>Evasive maneuvers activated.</i>

598
00:33:39,214 --> 00:33:41,615
I don't have
time for this.

599
00:33:41,617 --> 00:33:42,549
- Activate weapons.
- What?

600
00:33:42,551 --> 00:33:43,985
- <i>Activating weapons.</i>
- Relax.

601
00:33:43,987 --> 00:33:45,987
I'm just gonna
take out her tires.

602
00:33:45,989 --> 00:33:47,688
Uh, that's really bad.

603
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:48,856
I dare you.

604
00:33:48,858 --> 00:33:49,957
<i>Deactivating weapons.</i>

605
00:33:49,959 --> 00:33:51,025
No,
we're the good guys.

606
00:33:51,027 --> 00:33:52,959
We can't shoot
the other good guys.

607
00:33:52,961 --> 00:33:54,094
Yeah, you're right, Walter.

608
00:33:54,096 --> 00:33:55,496
Let's just pull over
and talk it out.

609
00:33:55,498 --> 00:33:56,631
Exactly. Can we?

610
00:33:56,633 --> 00:33:58,365
- Activate weapons.
- <i>Activating weapons.</i>

611
00:33:58,367 --> 00:34:00,535
- Deactivate weapons.
- <i>Deactivating weapons.</i>

612
00:34:00,537 --> 00:34:02,469
How about something
non-lethal like oil slick?

613
00:34:02,471 --> 00:34:03,336
Activate weapons.

614
00:34:03,338 --> 00:34:04,605
Deactivate weapons.

615
00:34:04,607 --> 00:34:06,341
Don't listen to Walter.
Activate weapons.

616
00:34:06,343 --> 00:34:07,508
- Oil slick.
- Activate weapons.

617
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:10,279
Oil slick! Oil slick!
Oil slick!

618
00:34:11,581 --> 00:34:13,113
This man trippin'.

619
00:34:13,115 --> 00:34:15,085
Oil slick! Oil slick!
Oil slick!

620
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:17,251
<i>Deactivate.</i>

621
00:34:17,253 --> 00:34:19,253
<i>System shut down. Goodbye.</i>

622
00:34:19,255 --> 00:34:21,291
Oh, what did you do?

623
00:34:29,365 --> 00:34:31,566
He's like a god
of the asphalt.

624
00:34:31,568 --> 00:34:32,736
We'll see about that.

625
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,606
All right, all right.
I got this. I got this.

626
00:34:38,608 --> 00:34:39,673
I got this. I got this.

627
00:34:39,675 --> 00:34:40,941
We're gonna die!

628
00:34:40,943 --> 00:34:43,043
- Oh, no.
- Watch out!

629
00:34:51,353 --> 00:34:53,422
We should be coming
up on him any second.

630
00:35:01,164 --> 00:35:02,963
This ends now.

631
00:35:02,965 --> 00:35:04,097
Is everyone in position?

632
00:35:04,099 --> 00:35:05,400
Affirmative.
In position.

633
00:35:05,402 --> 00:35:07,401
Walter, get that computer
back online.

634
00:35:07,403 --> 00:35:08,603
Systems coming back online.

635
00:35:08,605 --> 00:35:10,304
<i>Defensive applications online.</i>

636
00:35:10,306 --> 00:35:11,606
- Oil slick?
- Fine,

637
00:35:11,608 --> 00:35:12,706
whatever! Just press it!

638
00:35:13,876 --> 00:35:15,008
Wait!
We're driving backwards.

639
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:16,110
We're driving backwards.

640
00:35:44,807 --> 00:35:45,842
No!

641
00:35:58,521 --> 00:35:59,887
That was tight.

642
00:35:59,889 --> 00:36:02,289
Yep. It's official.
I'm a fan.

643
00:36:02,291 --> 00:36:05,828
Did anyone else see
a pigeon in that car?

644
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:09,199
<i>Auto-drive engaged.</i>

645
00:36:10,932 --> 00:36:14,300
I can't help but feel like
some of this is my fault.

646
00:36:14,302 --> 00:36:17,871
Some? Joker,
this is all your fault.

647
00:36:17,873 --> 00:36:20,007
Airstrip. Now.

648
00:36:20,009 --> 00:36:21,141
I'm sorry. Jeez.

649
00:36:21,143 --> 00:36:23,010
Didn't mean to ruffle
your feathers.

650
00:36:23,012 --> 00:36:24,845
I hate you.

651
00:36:40,429 --> 00:36:43,664
Lovey, this is the opportunity
we've been waiting for.

652
00:36:43,666 --> 00:36:46,300
There are so many gadgets
I wanna test in the field.

653
00:36:46,302 --> 00:36:48,269
We got the binder bubbles,
collide-oscope,

654
00:36:48,271 --> 00:36:50,438
hypno-stars,
blamethrower, snorepedo.

655
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,771
We've got the multi-pen.

656
00:36:51,773 --> 00:36:53,472
We haven't even tried the
multi-pen in the...

657
00:36:53,474 --> 00:36:55,677
I'm gonna need
a code name.

658
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:58,646
Bond. Hydrogen Bond.

659
00:36:58,648 --> 00:37:00,748
Oh, no, where is it?

660
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:02,349
Wait! What is that?

661
00:37:02,351 --> 00:37:03,717
What is that?

662
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:06,253
Oh! No, no. Fly, fly, fly!

663
00:37:21,103 --> 00:37:23,737
Hey, everything go okay
in there?

664
00:37:23,739 --> 00:37:26,740
I just found out that
number one and number two...

665
00:37:26,742 --> 00:37:29,476
both come out
of the same place.

666
00:37:29,478 --> 00:37:32,313
So, no.
Things are not okay.

667
00:37:32,315 --> 00:37:34,849
Yeah. It's called
a cloaca.

668
00:37:34,851 --> 00:37:36,483
It sounds weird and gross,

669
00:37:36,485 --> 00:37:38,117
but having a cloaca
just means...

670
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:39,353
Dude!

671
00:37:39,355 --> 00:37:41,387
I know what it means.

672
00:37:41,389 --> 00:37:43,757
Saw it in the mirror.

673
00:37:43,759 --> 00:37:46,193
I know you're not
in a good place right now...

674
00:37:46,195 --> 00:37:49,262
but there are benefits
to being a pigeon.

675
00:37:49,264 --> 00:37:51,632
Okay, so read
what used to be my lips.

676
00:37:51,634 --> 00:37:53,601
You're only here,
because A,

677
00:37:53,603 --> 00:37:55,970
I can't work a touchscreen
enough to eject you...

678
00:37:55,972 --> 00:38:00,206
and B, you're supposed to be
working on something, correct?

679
00:38:00,208 --> 00:38:01,874
Oh, the antidote.
Right. Sure.

680
00:38:01,876 --> 00:38:04,744
Yeah, that's going to take
18 hours to render.

681
00:38:04,746 --> 00:38:08,382
I'm stuck like this,
with this body, for 18...

682
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:10,650
Ooh, boy...

683
00:38:10,652 --> 00:38:13,589
Whoo! Okay,
walk this one off.

684
00:38:25,034 --> 00:38:27,367
You know,
being a pigeon

685
00:38:27,369 --> 00:38:30,338
is actually way cooler
than it seems.

686
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,639
And if you just embrace
your new form,

687
00:38:32,641 --> 00:38:34,608
you'll see
all the advantages.

688
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:37,211
Like, fact,
did you know

689
00:38:37,213 --> 00:38:39,512
that pigeons can see
in slow motion?

690
00:38:39,514 --> 00:38:41,014
Because, fact,
pigeons can fly

691
00:38:41,016 --> 00:38:43,516
up to 92.7 miles
per hour.

692
00:38:43,518 --> 00:38:44,818
And, fact, pigeons are

693
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:46,854
highly intelligent animals
who like to play games.

694
00:38:46,856 --> 00:38:47,854
Oh, and, fact...

695
00:38:47,856 --> 00:38:50,626
Fact! You should have kept
your seat belt on.

696
00:38:50,927 --> 00:38:52,126
Whoo!

697
00:38:56,264 --> 00:38:58,199
Fact, pigeons can see
ultraviolet light...

698
00:38:58,201 --> 00:38:59,633
which is a broad
spectrum of light

699
00:38:59,635 --> 00:39:01,135
the human eye
can't even see.

700
00:39:01,137 --> 00:39:02,869
Fact, pigeons are
a flock animal,

701
00:39:02,871 --> 00:39:04,304
which makes it easier
for them to...

702
00:39:18,753 --> 00:39:21,554
All right, Kimura,
I'm coming for you.

703
00:39:21,556 --> 00:39:24,258
Lance Sterling
is on the scene.

704
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:26,629
And Bond.
Hydrogen Bond.

705
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:31,599
Dude, you need medicine.

706
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:36,804
- Go, go, go!
- Hey!

707
00:39:36,806 --> 00:39:38,171
You just pushed me.

708
00:39:38,173 --> 00:39:40,641
All right, y'all better squad
up, 'cause here comes the...

709
00:39:40,643 --> 00:39:42,876
Hey! Did you just
toe-poke me?

710
00:39:42,878 --> 00:39:46,483
You're a pigeon.
You can walk right past them.

711
00:39:47,083 --> 00:39:48,617
Oh. Huh.

712
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,123
Just a regular old bird.

713
00:39:55,224 --> 00:39:56,923
Uh, that's not
a pigeon sound.

714
00:39:56,925 --> 00:39:58,325
Till you grow a cloaca,

715
00:39:58,327 --> 00:39:59,896
I decide
what the bird sounds are.

716
00:40:03,432 --> 00:40:04,798
They're so stupid.

717
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,465
You see, it's like
you're invisible.

718
00:40:06,467 --> 00:40:07,769
All right.

719
00:40:15,744 --> 00:40:17,378
Your room key, sir.

720
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,679
Bingo.

721
00:40:18,681 --> 00:40:20,680
Okay, let's figure this out.
You and me. Let's go.

722
00:40:20,682 --> 00:40:23,416
Let's brainstorm.
How we gonna find this nut?

723
00:40:23,418 --> 00:40:26,253
Uh, you are gonna
sit down right here

724
00:40:26,255 --> 00:40:27,987
on this very nice couch.

725
00:40:27,989 --> 00:40:29,021
But I'm your wingman.

726
00:40:29,023 --> 00:40:31,891
Ooh, you know who needs
a wingman? That couch.

727
00:40:31,893 --> 00:40:34,595
Go sit your narrow behind down
and do some science stuff...

728
00:40:34,597 --> 00:40:37,500
and I'mma go find Kimura.
Alone.

729
00:40:38,333 --> 00:40:41,401
Oh, what is that
heavenly smell?

730
00:40:41,403 --> 00:40:42,704
Mmm.

731
00:40:43,838 --> 00:40:45,171
Oh, no.

732
00:40:45,173 --> 00:40:47,007
Do not do it, Lance.

733
00:40:47,009 --> 00:40:48,342
Oh...

734
00:40:48,344 --> 00:40:50,612
Mmm. Lance!
Have some dignity.

735
00:40:52,315 --> 00:40:54,315
Walter, what is happening?

736
00:40:54,317 --> 00:40:57,351
It must be some sort of latent
avian instincts kicking in.

737
00:40:57,353 --> 00:40:59,188
Why am I eating food
off of the ground?

738
00:41:00,422 --> 00:41:02,157
Why does it taste amazing?

739
00:41:04,226 --> 00:41:06,726
Ugh. No, I'm good.
Thank you.

740
00:41:06,728 --> 00:41:08,795
Oh, wow.

741
00:41:08,797 --> 00:41:11,398
My dude, seriously,
give me 10 feet.

742
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,467
Hey, no, human feet.
Back up.

743
00:41:13,469 --> 00:41:16,137
Oh, no.
I wish I could unsee that.

744
00:41:16,139 --> 00:41:18,505
This is huge.
They've made you part of their flock.

745
00:41:18,507 --> 00:41:20,407
I'm not trying to be
a part of nobody's flock.

746
00:41:20,409 --> 00:41:22,709
Shoo! Back up, fanboy.

747
00:41:22,711 --> 00:41:24,778
I don't care that your name is Jeff.
Beat it.

748
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:26,046
You can understand them?

749
00:41:26,048 --> 00:41:27,179
What? No, no!

750
00:41:27,181 --> 00:41:28,648
- Does Lovey really love me?
- I'm not hearing bird-talk.

751
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:29,983
Am I her best friend?

752
00:41:29,985 --> 00:41:31,318
None of this is right!

753
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,586
Nice to meet you, Jeff.

754
00:41:32,588 --> 00:41:34,023
Stop talking to Jeff!

755
00:41:35,724 --> 00:41:36,691
Ugh.

756
00:41:57,012 --> 00:42:01,083
All right, what alias
are you using, Kimura?

757
00:42:05,021 --> 00:42:06,619
"Not Kimura."

758
00:42:06,621 --> 00:42:08,655
Wow. That's clever.

759
00:42:08,657 --> 00:42:10,993
I am way too good at this.

760
00:42:15,496 --> 00:42:16,929
Oh, come on.

761
00:42:16,931 --> 00:42:19,900
Seriously, fellas.
Not now.

762
00:42:19,902 --> 00:42:22,572
This is so humiliating.

763
00:42:23,905 --> 00:42:26,173
Hey, I'm not for the games.

764
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:27,977
You better not...
Mmm-mmm.

765
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:30,012
Stop it.

766
00:42:31,681 --> 00:42:33,583
Stop it! Stop!

767
00:42:35,717 --> 00:42:36,583
No!

768
00:42:36,585 --> 00:42:38,686
Stop it!
What is wrong with you?

769
00:42:42,958 --> 00:42:44,260
Oh.

770
00:43:05,914 --> 00:43:09,215
Well, would you look at that?
Being in a flock helped you.

771
00:43:09,217 --> 00:43:10,483
Not my flock!

772
00:43:10,485 --> 00:43:11,818
Lance...

773
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:13,186
Lance.

774
00:43:13,188 --> 00:43:14,322
Wait, wait, wait. Uh...

775
00:43:14,324 --> 00:43:16,255
You should not
go up there alone.

776
00:43:16,257 --> 00:43:18,358
Maybe I have something else
that can help.

777
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:22,561
Walter, I do not need
your help.

778
00:43:22,563 --> 00:43:23,932
Never will.

779
00:43:26,869 --> 00:43:28,202
Can you push "20"
for me, please?

780
00:43:28,204 --> 00:43:29,501
I thought
you didn't need any help.

781
00:43:29,503 --> 00:43:30,604
I don't.

782
00:43:30,606 --> 00:43:31,737
- Feels like helping.
- Nope.

783
00:43:31,739 --> 00:43:32,873
- Yeah, a little bit.
- Didn't.

784
00:43:32,875 --> 00:43:35,177
- Did!
- Did not!

785
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:10,711
Who's there?

786
00:44:10,713 --> 00:44:13,579
Talk while you still
have lips.

787
00:44:13,581 --> 00:44:14,815
Shut it, Kimura.

788
00:44:14,817 --> 00:44:17,387
Sterling.

789
00:44:18,286 --> 00:44:21,054
Uh-uh. Eyes front,
hands up.

790
00:44:21,056 --> 00:44:23,657
Ooh. Scratch that.
Pick up your towel.

791
00:44:23,659 --> 00:44:25,128
One hand up.

792
00:44:27,128 --> 00:44:28,394
What do you want?

793
00:44:28,396 --> 00:44:29,896
Here's how this works.

794
00:44:29,898 --> 00:44:32,566
I ask the questions,
you answer.

795
00:44:32,568 --> 00:44:33,633
What?

796
00:44:33,635 --> 00:44:34,769
What?

797
00:44:34,771 --> 00:44:36,403
I don't know
how to answer that.

798
00:44:36,405 --> 00:44:37,670
How did you get here?

799
00:44:37,672 --> 00:44:39,005
Huh? How did I...

800
00:44:39,007 --> 00:44:41,173
I'm not telling you anything.

801
00:44:41,175 --> 00:44:42,476
Stop! Get off of me.

802
00:44:42,478 --> 00:44:45,211
You sold the Assassin
to a guy with a robot hand.

803
00:44:45,213 --> 00:44:46,179
Where is he?

804
00:44:46,181 --> 00:44:47,914
He'll kill me
if I tell you that.

805
00:44:47,916 --> 00:44:50,420
Oh, and you think
I won't? Talk!

806
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:05,093
Remarkable. A remote-operated pigeon.

807
00:45:05,095 --> 00:45:06,432
How do you make it speak?

808
00:45:06,434 --> 00:45:07,534
Oh!

809
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,608
All right, Kimura,
3 ounces of pressure to the vagus nerve.

810
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:16,175
Sleepy night-night!

811
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:22,351
I miss my hands.

812
00:45:26,121 --> 00:45:28,054
Lance Sterling
is gonna die a pigeon...

813
00:45:28,056 --> 00:45:31,124
and be buried in a shoebox.

814
00:45:38,934 --> 00:45:40,503
Lance, are you okay?

815
00:45:41,003 --> 00:45:42,105
Walter?

816
00:45:45,139 --> 00:45:48,342
Sterling is here somewhere.
I want agents on every exit.

817
00:45:48,344 --> 00:45:49,742
And everyone be careful.

818
00:45:49,744 --> 00:45:51,480
This is Lance Sterling
we're dealing with.

819
00:45:52,481 --> 00:45:54,046
Tell me where
Robo Hand is.

820
00:45:54,048 --> 00:45:54,949
Never.

821
00:45:54,951 --> 00:45:57,987
Boy, I'm about to
pigeon-wing-slap...

822
00:46:00,021 --> 00:46:02,188
Oh. Oh, tough guy.
Okay.

823
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:03,956
Then we do it
the hard way.

824
00:46:03,958 --> 00:46:05,791
Walter,
I need a funnel,

825
00:46:05,793 --> 00:46:07,427
jumper cables,
and a Nickelback album.

826
00:46:07,429 --> 00:46:08,494
Nickelback?

827
00:46:08,496 --> 00:46:10,296
What?
But that would hurt him.

828
00:46:10,298 --> 00:46:11,833
That's the whole point.

829
00:46:12,367 --> 00:46:13,536
I know what to do.

830
00:46:15,503 --> 00:46:16,704
No, no, no.

831
00:46:16,706 --> 00:46:18,204
- Don't do that.
- Ooh.

832
00:46:18,206 --> 00:46:19,905
That's what
I'm talking about, Walter.

833
00:46:19,907 --> 00:46:21,175
Go science on this fool!

834
00:46:21,177 --> 00:46:22,575
Oh, yeah!

835
00:46:22,577 --> 00:46:24,512
I'm gonna science
all over your face.

836
00:46:24,514 --> 00:46:26,349
Please, don't!

837
00:46:30,018 --> 00:46:32,719
Did you just give that
man a refreshing spritz?

838
00:46:32,721 --> 00:46:34,588
It's a truth serum,
but yes,

839
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:36,188
it has a lavender
quality to it.

840
00:46:36,190 --> 00:46:37,090
Watch.

841
00:46:37,092 --> 00:46:39,525
Kimura,
what's your biggest secret?

842
00:46:39,527 --> 00:46:41,693
I peed in the pool.

843
00:46:41,695 --> 00:46:43,597
That's a lot of honesty.

844
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:46,599
Who is Robo Hand?
And why is he wearing my face?

845
00:46:46,601 --> 00:46:47,934
I don't know who he is.

846
00:46:47,936 --> 00:46:49,269
Then what do you know?

847
00:46:49,271 --> 00:46:50,871
Well, I know
how to play the flute.

848
00:46:50,873 --> 00:46:52,271
About Robo Hand!

849
00:46:52,273 --> 00:46:54,474
I know he's on his way
to Venice right now

850
00:46:54,476 --> 00:46:55,974
to steal the Agent Database.

851
00:46:55,976 --> 00:46:57,677
He's going to kill me.

852
00:46:57,679 --> 00:46:59,246
- Agent Database?
- Database.

853
00:46:59,248 --> 00:47:00,612
Who says "database"?

854
00:47:00,614 --> 00:47:01,882
Shut up.

855
00:47:01,884 --> 00:47:05,050
He'll know the identities
of everyone at the Agency.

856
00:47:05,052 --> 00:47:07,054
And once he does...

857
00:47:07,056 --> 00:47:10,923
he'll use the Assassin
to eliminate all of them.

858
00:47:10,925 --> 00:47:13,161
Not if I stop him first.

859
00:47:15,164 --> 00:47:17,697
She is relentless.

860
00:47:17,699 --> 00:47:19,501
Block the door.
We need something heavy.

861
00:47:20,402 --> 00:47:21,838
I'm heavy.

862
00:47:23,972 --> 00:47:25,137
Are you pulling?

863
00:47:25,139 --> 00:47:27,240
Of course I'm pulling!
Why aren't you pushing?

864
00:47:27,242 --> 00:47:28,374
Just put your weight
behind it.

865
00:47:28,376 --> 00:47:30,913
I am putting my weight!
I'm feathers!

866
00:47:33,916 --> 00:47:37,086
It's like a big bag
of pudding!

867
00:47:40,655 --> 00:47:41,854
Ugh. Yuck.

868
00:47:41,856 --> 00:47:44,391
This is so embarrassing.

869
00:47:46,762 --> 00:47:48,862
Come on, Walter.
Use your glutes.

870
00:47:50,498 --> 00:47:51,930
You're out of moves, Sterling.

871
00:47:51,932 --> 00:47:53,733
You and Beckett
are wanted for treason.

872
00:47:53,735 --> 00:47:55,068
We gotta go. Now.

873
00:47:55,070 --> 00:47:56,568
No. Don't leave me
like this.

874
00:47:56,570 --> 00:47:58,003
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

875
00:47:58,005 --> 00:47:59,738
- Ears?
- Consider it done.

876
00:48:03,644 --> 00:48:05,644
We gotta get to that balcony.
We're gonna have to parkour.

877
00:48:05,646 --> 00:48:06,713
What?

878
00:48:06,715 --> 00:48:08,248
Cat pass! Tic-tac!
Jelly roll!

879
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:09,916
Desk lamp!
Flimflam! Bottle cap!

880
00:48:09,918 --> 00:48:11,653
I don't know
what any of that means.

881
00:48:17,059 --> 00:48:18,291
Hi.

882
00:48:18,293 --> 00:48:20,293
What the... What happened
to you?

883
00:48:20,295 --> 00:48:22,429
Oh, don't do that.
You're gonna make me...

884
00:48:24,266 --> 00:48:26,266
Now or never, Walter.
Gotta go! Come on, Walter!

885
00:48:26,268 --> 00:48:27,367
You can do this!

886
00:48:27,369 --> 00:48:29,570
Okay, it's a physics problem,
Walter. Come on.

887
00:48:29,572 --> 00:48:30,970
It's basic physics!

888
00:48:30,972 --> 00:48:32,738
It's just basic physics.

889
00:48:37,512 --> 00:48:39,311
You're right.

890
00:48:39,313 --> 00:48:41,014
- We can do this.
- Beckett!

891
00:48:41,016 --> 00:48:42,516
- We can do this.
- Beckett, don't you...

892
00:48:42,518 --> 00:48:43,751
We're gonna do this!

893
00:48:43,753 --> 00:48:44,954
We can do this!

894
00:48:53,027 --> 00:48:55,028
Use your gadgets!

895
00:48:55,030 --> 00:48:57,063
Use your gadgets!

896
00:48:57,065 --> 00:48:59,135
A-ha! Grappling hook!

897
00:49:00,202 --> 00:49:03,105
Fly! Fly!
What am I doing wrong?

898
00:49:06,106 --> 00:49:07,710
There he is!

899
00:49:11,914 --> 00:49:14,246
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

900
00:49:20,588 --> 00:49:22,356
Well, that's not good.

901
00:49:27,329 --> 00:49:28,260
Oh!

902
00:49:28,262 --> 00:49:29,699
Walter, what else
you got on that pen?

903
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:32,601
No.

904
00:49:38,139 --> 00:49:40,442
Oh, hello, soft landing.

905
00:49:40,809 --> 00:49:42,278
Oh! Whoa!

906
00:49:42,978 --> 00:49:44,547
Walter!

907
00:49:57,192 --> 00:49:58,358
Go, go, go!

908
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:59,959
Oh, these guys
are the worst.

909
00:49:59,961 --> 00:50:01,061
- There he is!
- Don't move!

910
00:50:01,063 --> 00:50:02,762
The multi-pen!

911
00:50:02,764 --> 00:50:04,400
Yes! Great.
Shoot 'em!

912
00:50:06,101 --> 00:50:08,068
Well, that is suboptimal.

913
00:50:08,070 --> 00:50:10,405
That has a bit of
a suck factor to it.

914
00:50:14,309 --> 00:50:16,642
Yeah, pillow.
Good call.

915
00:50:19,547 --> 00:50:21,583
Lance, get down.

916
00:50:22,617 --> 00:50:23,719
Get down!

917
00:50:28,958 --> 00:50:30,526
Huh?

918
00:50:32,793 --> 00:50:34,693
Serious string.

919
00:50:34,695 --> 00:50:36,929
Like Silly String,
but serious.

920
00:50:36,931 --> 00:50:39,199
Oddly effective.

921
00:50:39,201 --> 00:50:42,137
Come on, let's ghost.

922
00:50:43,105 --> 00:50:45,005
There's something
you don't see every day.

923
00:50:45,007 --> 00:50:47,507
Wow. This is tripped out.

924
00:50:47,509 --> 00:50:50,075
This is...
I don't know what this is.

925
00:50:50,077 --> 00:50:52,144
This couldn't
have been Sterling.

926
00:50:52,146 --> 00:50:53,713
No one's even hurt.

927
00:50:53,715 --> 00:50:55,280
It might be
that kid, Beckett.

928
00:50:55,282 --> 00:50:56,950
But that doesn't make sense!

929
00:50:56,952 --> 00:50:59,753
Beckett is just some nobody
in the gadget lab.

930
00:50:59,755 --> 00:51:01,019
Well, according
to his file,

931
00:51:01,021 --> 00:51:03,523
that "nobody"
graduated MIT at 15...

932
00:51:03,525 --> 00:51:06,793
and invented a way
to edit human genomes

933
00:51:06,795 --> 00:51:08,260
in middle school.

934
00:51:08,262 --> 00:51:10,597
Dude is <i>Jeopardy!</i> smart.

935
00:51:10,599 --> 00:51:12,398
Well, so are we.

936
00:51:14,268 --> 00:51:16,202
I stepped in it.

937
00:51:16,204 --> 00:51:17,537
I stepped in the goo.

938
00:51:17,539 --> 00:51:19,271
Yeah, me, too.

939
00:51:19,273 --> 00:51:22,077
These are my new kicks, man.

940
00:51:30,885 --> 00:51:31,952
I hope this works.

941
00:51:31,954 --> 00:51:33,220
I hope this works.
I hope this works.

942
00:51:33,222 --> 00:51:35,722
Please, please, please.

943
00:51:44,032 --> 00:51:46,132
<i>Weapons system online.</i>

944
00:51:46,134 --> 00:51:48,135
<i>Agent Database
required for targeting.</i>

945
00:51:48,137 --> 00:51:49,336
It's done!

946
00:51:49,338 --> 00:51:53,072
The entire facility
is running at full capacity.

947
00:51:53,074 --> 00:51:54,643
Everything is exactly
how you wanted it.

948
00:51:55,777 --> 00:51:59,579
But, please, the destruction
this is capable of...

949
00:52:00,615 --> 00:52:03,383
Since when
does your agency care

950
00:52:03,385 --> 00:52:07,554
about the many, many,
many lives it destroys?

951
00:52:07,556 --> 00:52:10,257
No!
Wait, wait, wait! No, no, no!

952
00:52:10,259 --> 00:52:13,059
No, please, please!
Wait, wait, wait!

953
00:52:13,061 --> 00:52:15,228
You said if I helped you,
you'd let me go.

954
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:18,634
Oh, yeah, I did.
Didn't I?

955
00:52:21,503 --> 00:52:24,606
I hear Venice is wonderful
this time of year.

956
00:52:32,081 --> 00:52:33,380
Aw, yeah.

957
00:52:33,382 --> 00:52:35,115
Just wait
till I get to Venice.

958
00:52:35,117 --> 00:52:37,316
I'mma tear that fool
his own cloaca.

959
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:40,322
Walter!

960
00:52:41,056 --> 00:52:42,488
- Walter!
- Huh? What?

961
00:52:42,490 --> 00:52:44,559
You're still working
on that antidote, right?

962
00:52:45,059 --> 00:52:46,391
Working on it?

963
00:52:46,393 --> 00:52:47,894
In a couple minutes,
it's done.

964
00:52:48,998 --> 00:52:51,030
But do you know
what else is working?

965
00:52:51,032 --> 00:52:52,465
If you say being a pigeon...

966
00:52:52,467 --> 00:52:54,034
Being a pigeon!

967
00:52:54,036 --> 00:52:56,101
I'm really gonna
throw this boy in the ocean.

968
00:52:56,103 --> 00:52:57,170
What?

969
00:52:57,172 --> 00:52:58,970
Hey, how did
y'all get here?

970
00:52:58,972 --> 00:53:01,673
Jeff and Crazy Eyes
aren't going to abandon you.

971
00:53:01,675 --> 00:53:04,010
- They're part of your flock.
- Come on. No.

972
00:53:04,012 --> 00:53:05,144
Get your beak
out my drink.

973
00:53:05,146 --> 00:53:06,679
I have no idea
where that beak has been.

974
00:53:06,681 --> 00:53:07,679
Back out.

975
00:53:07,681 --> 00:53:10,048
- No! Stop it!
- Okay, okay.

976
00:53:10,050 --> 00:53:11,150
Here you go, guys.
Come on.

977
00:53:11,152 --> 00:53:13,320
Have some of these.
They're gluten-free.

978
00:53:13,322 --> 00:53:14,454
You're joking, right?

979
00:53:14,456 --> 00:53:17,124
That one ate gum
stuck to a tissue.

980
00:53:21,262 --> 00:53:22,695
And a spy pen.

981
00:53:22,697 --> 00:53:24,898
We should probably
do something about that.

982
00:53:27,268 --> 00:53:28,633
It's ready.

983
00:53:28,635 --> 00:53:30,135
Finally.

984
00:53:40,914 --> 00:53:42,449
May I?

985
00:53:42,451 --> 00:53:44,686
Not this time, Lovey.
Thank you.

986
00:53:45,052 --> 00:53:46,186
Ow!

987
00:53:46,188 --> 00:53:47,623
Joker.

988
00:54:02,737 --> 00:54:04,237
Well, that's not good.

989
00:54:04,239 --> 00:54:06,805
"Not good" as in
it'll taste bad

990
00:54:06,807 --> 00:54:08,708
but still turn me back
into a human?

991
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:10,677
Mmm, "not good" as in
it won't turn you

992
00:54:10,679 --> 00:54:11,911
back into a human...

993
00:54:11,913 --> 00:54:14,046
and if you drink it,
all your cells will catch on fire.

994
00:54:14,048 --> 00:54:15,148
Come on, man!

995
00:54:15,150 --> 00:54:16,916
I'm sorry.
I'll figure it out.

996
00:54:16,918 --> 00:54:18,251
Science is
all trial and error.

997
00:54:18,253 --> 00:54:20,253
This isn't
a science lab.

998
00:54:20,255 --> 00:54:23,389
If I don't stop this guy,
people will die!

999
00:54:23,391 --> 00:54:25,157
You don't think
that I want to stop him, too?

1000
00:54:25,159 --> 00:54:26,793
Why do you think
I'm on this boat?

1001
00:54:26,795 --> 00:54:28,827
Do you have any idea

1002
00:54:28,829 --> 00:54:31,597
of how much motion sickness
medication I'm on right now?

1003
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:35,202
I can hardly feel my legs!

1004
00:54:35,204 --> 00:54:38,470
But I'm here
because I believe...

1005
00:54:38,472 --> 00:54:44,012
together, we can find
a good way to stop the bad.

1006
00:54:47,014 --> 00:54:48,783
I know you do, man.

1007
00:54:49,952 --> 00:54:52,619
But it's a fantasy.

1008
00:54:52,621 --> 00:54:56,956
When the bad guys hit you,
you hit 'em back.

1009
00:54:56,958 --> 00:55:01,226
You hit 'em so hard
that they don't get back up.

1010
00:55:01,228 --> 00:55:04,597
You gotta fight fire
with fire.

1011
00:55:04,599 --> 00:55:09,403
When we fight fire with fire,
we all get burned.

1012
00:55:09,405 --> 00:55:12,374
There's no good guys
or bad guys.

1013
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:13,976
Just people.

1014
00:55:16,010 --> 00:55:18,313
And people are worth saving.

1015
00:55:18,947 --> 00:55:20,481
Isn't that our job?

1016
00:55:22,182 --> 00:55:26,521
Evil doesn't care
that you're nice.

1017
00:55:31,259 --> 00:55:36,128
I watch good people
be taken every day.

1018
00:55:38,233 --> 00:55:40,336
But you wouldn't know
nothing about that.

1019
00:55:44,972 --> 00:55:46,708
You'd be surprised.

1020
00:56:10,599 --> 00:56:12,298
First time in Venice?

1021
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:13,999
First time anywhere, really.

1022
00:56:14,001 --> 00:56:15,267
It's always been my dream

1023
00:56:15,269 --> 00:56:17,403
to come here
and feed the pigeons.

1024
00:56:17,405 --> 00:56:18,907
You need help.

1025
00:56:25,713 --> 00:56:27,545
Time to put
your game face on.

1026
00:56:27,547 --> 00:56:29,215
That's the Agency Data Vault.

1027
00:56:29,217 --> 00:56:30,583
Data Vault.

1028
00:56:30,585 --> 00:56:33,251
If Robo Hand wants
a list of agents,

1029
00:56:33,253 --> 00:56:35,155
that's where he'll find it.

1030
00:56:35,157 --> 00:56:36,889
- You remember the plan?
- What plan?

1031
00:56:36,891 --> 00:56:38,657
You said, "Stay out of the
way and let me kick some..."

1032
00:56:38,659 --> 00:56:39,925
Good. You remember it.

1033
00:56:41,730 --> 00:56:43,932
Long way
from home, Walter.

1034
00:56:44,365 --> 00:56:45,898
Kimura talked.

1035
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:49,101
I know Sterling's here
in Venice. Where is he?

1036
00:56:49,103 --> 00:56:50,806
Stay cool.

1037
00:56:52,039 --> 00:56:53,472
Where's Sterling?

1038
00:56:53,474 --> 00:56:56,108
I can tell you
where he's not.

1039
00:56:56,110 --> 00:56:58,744
Which is right here.

1040
00:56:59,681 --> 00:57:02,548
What? No,
we can't just kill her.

1041
00:57:02,550 --> 00:57:04,550
That's dark, Lovey.

1042
00:57:04,552 --> 00:57:08,287
Look, I know
you're not a criminal.

1043
00:57:08,289 --> 00:57:11,490
You're a bright kid.

1044
00:57:11,492 --> 00:57:15,896
You're inventing things that
nobody has ever thought of.

1045
00:57:15,898 --> 00:57:19,231
I know because my boot is
still stuck in one of 'em.

1046
00:57:19,233 --> 00:57:20,666
Sorry.

1047
00:57:20,668 --> 00:57:24,670
No, no. We're the ones
who owe you an apology.

1048
00:57:24,672 --> 00:57:28,273
You're trying to keep
the world safe...

1049
00:57:28,275 --> 00:57:30,178
just like your mother did.

1050
00:57:32,514 --> 00:57:34,447
I read your file.

1051
00:57:34,449 --> 00:57:39,021
I know she sacrificed her life
to save people.

1052
00:57:41,222 --> 00:57:43,389
I can help you, Walter.

1053
00:57:43,391 --> 00:57:45,657
I can get you
your job back.

1054
00:57:45,659 --> 00:57:48,963
A new lab.
All the equipment you need.

1055
00:57:50,097 --> 00:57:52,632
Show them what you can do...

1056
00:57:52,634 --> 00:57:57,172
and no one will
ever call you weird again.

1057
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:01,977
You just have
to give me Sterling.

1058
00:58:04,211 --> 00:58:05,845
No.

1059
00:58:05,847 --> 00:58:07,847
We should
all be working together.

1060
00:58:09,416 --> 00:58:11,586
Bad move, Beckett.

1061
00:58:12,554 --> 00:58:13,619
Sterling!

1062
00:58:14,989 --> 00:58:17,090
Stay here.

1063
00:58:17,092 --> 00:58:18,693
Let's go.

1064
00:58:22,797 --> 00:58:24,597
- It's the Assassin.
- Come on.

1065
00:58:24,599 --> 00:58:25,764
Destroy the target!

1066
00:58:25,766 --> 00:58:27,066
We can't let that thing
out of here.

1067
00:58:27,068 --> 00:58:28,200
Open fire!

1068
00:58:28,202 --> 00:58:29,334
It's got the database.

1069
00:58:30,505 --> 00:58:31,737
Oh, man.

1070
00:58:31,739 --> 00:58:33,106
It's not working!

1071
00:58:33,108 --> 00:58:34,240
I'm on it.

1072
00:58:36,476 --> 00:58:37,876
This is not good!

1073
00:58:37,878 --> 00:58:39,581
- Take cover!
- Now!

1074
00:58:48,523 --> 00:58:50,322
- Let's go.
- Beckett, don't you...

1075
00:58:50,324 --> 00:58:51,856
- Don't worry. We'll stop it.
- Beckett!

1076
00:58:51,858 --> 00:58:54,996
I mean, I'll stop it,
because Lance is definitely not here.

1077
00:59:02,570 --> 00:59:04,003
We can't catch this thing
on foot.

1078
00:59:04,005 --> 00:59:05,438
Whoa, hey, hey,
what are you doing?

1079
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:06,604
You're a pigeon, Lance.

1080
00:59:06,606 --> 00:59:07,807
You're one of the fastest
birds in the world.

1081
00:59:07,809 --> 00:59:09,307
No, put me down, Walter!

1082
00:59:09,309 --> 00:59:11,242
You need to fly!
I believe in you.

1083
00:59:11,244 --> 00:59:12,412
There's another way!

1084
00:59:12,414 --> 00:59:15,182
Boy, don't you throw me
off this roof!

1085
00:59:17,619 --> 00:59:19,150
He'll figure it out.

1086
00:59:22,289 --> 00:59:24,092
Come on.
I'm gonna die.

1087
00:59:28,563 --> 00:59:29,795
I'm flying.

1088
00:59:29,797 --> 00:59:31,998
I'm flying.

1089
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:32,865
I'm flying...

1090
00:59:32,867 --> 00:59:35,501
Oh, you're flying me.

1091
00:59:35,503 --> 00:59:37,369
Thank you.
Good looking out.

1092
00:59:37,371 --> 00:59:38,906
Whoa!

1093
00:59:39,974 --> 00:59:42,842
Whoa. All right, guys.
Let's go!

1094
00:59:42,844 --> 00:59:44,476
We got an Assassin to catch.

1095
00:59:44,478 --> 00:59:46,144
Excuse me.
Sorry.

1096
00:59:49,351 --> 00:59:50,816
That works, too.

1097
00:59:50,818 --> 00:59:52,853
- This is official business!
- Oh.

1098
00:59:56,623 --> 00:59:58,693
Okay.

1099
01:00:01,262 --> 01:00:02,927
Phew.

1100
01:00:04,865 --> 01:00:06,934
This is official business!

1101
01:00:07,835 --> 01:00:09,534
We need to get
that database.

1102
01:00:09,536 --> 01:00:10,603
Any ideas?

1103
01:00:12,306 --> 01:00:14,376
Oh! I like how you think.

1104
01:00:16,210 --> 01:00:17,409
Bullseye!

1105
01:00:17,411 --> 01:00:18,644
Got it.

1106
01:00:22,184 --> 01:00:24,720
Yeah, didn't think
he'd like that.

1107
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:26,922
Good job.

1108
01:00:28,657 --> 01:00:31,191
Oh, that's right.
You all like games.

1109
01:00:31,193 --> 01:00:32,828
Let's play
some Keep Away.

1110
01:00:33,927 --> 01:00:34,929
Go long.

1111
01:00:37,065 --> 01:00:38,700
Oh, no!

1112
01:00:47,442 --> 01:00:49,777
Not so easy,
is it, Roomba?

1113
01:00:51,679 --> 01:00:54,048
Lovey, all you, girl!

1114
01:00:54,548 --> 01:00:56,018
Hit me. I'm open.

1115
01:00:56,650 --> 01:00:58,117
I got it! I got it!

1116
01:00:58,119 --> 01:00:59,121
Oh, no.

1117
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:13,833
Oh, no, no, no!

1118
01:01:13,835 --> 01:01:15,037
This is about to suck!

1119
01:01:18,239 --> 01:01:20,005
No!

1120
01:01:20,007 --> 01:01:21,909
Come on, come on, come on!

1121
01:01:27,414 --> 01:01:29,315
Catch of the century!

1122
01:01:29,317 --> 01:01:31,550
I've never caught anything
in my whole life!

1123
01:01:36,657 --> 01:01:38,490
That was amazing.
We did it!

1124
01:01:38,492 --> 01:01:39,592
We're gonna
talk about

1125
01:01:39,594 --> 01:01:40,825
you throwing me
off that roof, though.

1126
01:01:40,827 --> 01:01:42,595
Yeah, I really thought
that would work out better.

1127
01:01:42,597 --> 01:01:43,729
Nah, it's cool, it's cool.

1128
01:01:43,731 --> 01:01:44,963
We're gonna holler
about it in a minute.

1129
01:01:44,965 --> 01:01:46,599
You know, I'm gonna let you
have this moment.

1130
01:01:46,601 --> 01:01:48,470
Whoo! We're unstoppable...

1131
01:02:04,686 --> 01:02:06,217
Uh-uh-uh.

1132
01:02:06,219 --> 01:02:08,454
That belongs to me.

1133
01:02:08,456 --> 01:02:13,159
Technically, it belongs to
the United States government.

1134
01:02:15,230 --> 01:02:18,065
Lance! Lance!

1135
01:02:18,766 --> 01:02:20,599
Sterling?

1136
01:02:20,601 --> 01:02:23,001
What do you say, Lance?

1137
01:02:23,003 --> 01:02:26,338
Come out.
We'll have some good fun.

1138
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:28,340
You're the hero, right?

1139
01:02:28,342 --> 01:02:31,144
The spy who saves the day...

1140
01:02:31,146 --> 01:02:35,217
destroying anybody
that stands in your way.

1141
01:02:38,119 --> 01:02:40,153
Oh, I'd love
to have some fun.

1142
01:02:43,324 --> 01:02:44,657
Guess he's not coming.

1143
01:02:44,659 --> 01:02:47,262
No.

1144
01:02:48,563 --> 01:02:50,662
Ah, life's full
of disappointment.

1145
01:02:52,733 --> 01:02:54,499
You don't have
to do it this way.

1146
01:02:54,501 --> 01:02:56,001
It won't make
anything better.

1147
01:02:56,003 --> 01:02:57,202
No.

1148
01:02:57,204 --> 01:02:58,336
No!

1149
01:02:59,706 --> 01:03:01,208
Walter!

1150
01:03:20,393 --> 01:03:21,862
Breadcrumbs?

1151
01:03:26,568 --> 01:03:28,635
They're gluten-free.

1152
01:03:34,876 --> 01:03:36,478
Lance, let's go.

1153
01:03:43,518 --> 01:03:46,452
Hold it right there!

1154
01:03:46,454 --> 01:03:48,890
Turn around
nice and slow!

1155
01:03:50,490 --> 01:03:52,193
Hands where I can see them.

1156
01:03:57,331 --> 01:03:59,300
Both hands.

1157
01:04:00,467 --> 01:04:01,902
Watch out!

1158
01:04:05,005 --> 01:04:09,608
Did anybody else see that
Agent Sterling had...

1159
01:04:09,610 --> 01:04:12,177
A robot hand?

1160
01:04:12,179 --> 01:04:13,579
Yeah.

1161
01:04:20,989 --> 01:04:23,389
Phew.
Totally crazy.

1162
01:04:23,391 --> 01:04:25,724
When he had his foot on my
head, I was like...

1163
01:04:25,726 --> 01:04:27,126
And you were like, "No!"

1164
01:04:27,128 --> 01:04:29,128
And then, I was like,
"Breadcrumbs!"

1165
01:04:29,130 --> 01:04:31,731
He still got away
with the database.

1166
01:04:31,733 --> 01:04:33,733
Or did he?

1167
01:04:33,735 --> 01:04:37,105
Or did he?

1168
01:04:37,905 --> 01:04:39,938
Or did he?

1169
01:04:39,940 --> 01:04:41,773
I feel like
you want me to say,

1170
01:04:41,775 --> 01:04:42,941
"What are you
talking about?"

1171
01:04:42,943 --> 01:04:44,809
Oh, I'll tell you
what I'm talking about.

1172
01:04:44,811 --> 01:04:47,713
During the whole
bird-nado thing,

1173
01:04:47,715 --> 01:04:49,117
I put a tracker on him.

1174
01:04:49,951 --> 01:04:51,784
Wait. That's him?

1175
01:04:51,786 --> 01:04:53,452
That's Robo Hand?

1176
01:04:53,454 --> 01:04:55,653
- Yep.
- Yes!

1177
01:04:55,655 --> 01:04:57,123
Yes! My man!

1178
01:04:57,125 --> 01:04:58,856
Oh, there is no way

1179
01:04:58,858 --> 01:05:00,592
I could have done this
without you, Walter.

1180
01:05:00,594 --> 01:05:02,795
- What?
- What?

1181
01:05:02,797 --> 01:05:04,030
What did you say?

1182
01:05:04,032 --> 01:05:05,296
I think I said...

1183
01:05:05,298 --> 01:05:07,902
You said you couldn't
have done it without me.

1184
01:05:20,847 --> 01:05:22,248
All right.

1185
01:05:22,250 --> 01:05:24,383
Okay, we've reached the
time limit on this, Walter.

1186
01:05:24,385 --> 01:05:26,853
All right, hey, hey,
will you stop?

1187
01:05:26,855 --> 01:05:28,987
You're squeezing too...

1188
01:05:28,989 --> 01:05:30,391
Oh! Whoa!

1189
01:05:38,365 --> 01:05:41,934
Walter, what happens
in the submarine

1190
01:05:41,936 --> 01:05:43,869
stays in the submarine.

1191
01:05:43,871 --> 01:05:45,271
You just laid an egg.

1192
01:05:45,273 --> 01:05:46,838
You laid an egg!

1193
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:49,041
It just kinda
slipped out, man.

1194
01:05:49,043 --> 01:05:50,575
You just laid an egg!

1195
01:05:50,577 --> 01:05:52,211
Lance, this is amazing.

1196
01:05:52,213 --> 01:05:53,780
Do you not realize
what this means?

1197
01:05:53,782 --> 01:05:54,914
You're a girl!

1198
01:05:54,916 --> 01:05:56,081
Oh! Excuse me?

1199
01:05:56,083 --> 01:05:57,383
Of course, of course.

1200
01:05:57,385 --> 01:05:59,017
That's why
I couldn't figure this out.

1201
01:05:59,019 --> 01:06:01,954
I used Lovey's DNA in the serum.

1202
01:06:01,956 --> 01:06:03,889
And that helps us how?

1203
01:06:03,891 --> 01:06:05,456
Because now
all I need to do

1204
01:06:05,458 --> 01:06:07,758
is change one variable
in the antidote...

1205
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:09,230
and you'll be human again.

1206
01:06:09,831 --> 01:06:11,662
I'm gonna be me.

1207
01:06:11,664 --> 01:06:13,532
Unless, you know,

1208
01:06:13,534 --> 01:06:16,237
maybe you wanna stay
a pigeon a little longer.

1209
01:06:17,905 --> 01:06:19,107
Right.

1210
01:06:19,806 --> 01:06:21,072
Of course.

1211
01:06:21,074 --> 01:06:23,377
One antidote
coming right up.

1212
01:06:35,155 --> 01:06:38,023
Director Jenkins,
we lost the database.

1213
01:06:38,025 --> 01:06:40,092
Every Agency employee
is compromised.

1214
01:06:40,094 --> 01:06:42,327
You need to pull everyone in
for their own safety.

1215
01:06:44,030 --> 01:06:45,831
<i>And you're sure
it was Lance?</i>

1216
01:06:45,833 --> 01:06:47,298
Yes.

1217
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:48,367
Maybe?

1218
01:06:48,369 --> 01:06:51,006
Okay, I don't know
what I saw.

1219
01:06:51,672 --> 01:06:54,340
But I still know for a fact

1220
01:06:54,342 --> 01:06:56,175
that Sterling came here
on this boat.

1221
01:06:56,177 --> 01:06:57,642
Sterling
wasn't on this boat.

1222
01:06:57,644 --> 01:06:58,577
Son of a...

1223
01:06:58,579 --> 01:07:01,347
Come on!
There's gotta be something.

1224
01:07:01,349 --> 01:07:03,481
A footprint,
a candy wrapper,

1225
01:07:03,483 --> 01:07:05,184
some overpriced
face lotion...

1226
01:07:05,186 --> 01:07:06,418
because there is no way

1227
01:07:06,420 --> 01:07:08,387
that his skin looks
that good without help.

1228
01:07:08,389 --> 01:07:10,155
Look, everything is
coming up blank.

1229
01:07:10,157 --> 01:07:11,690
If Sterling was
on this boat...

1230
01:07:11,692 --> 01:07:13,124
he didn't leave
a fingerprint,

1231
01:07:13,126 --> 01:07:15,293
his lips never touched
a glass...

1232
01:07:15,295 --> 01:07:18,764
and somehow
he didn't have feet.

1233
01:07:20,333 --> 01:07:21,633
<i>I think it's safe
to say that</i>

1234
01:07:21,635 --> 01:07:24,639
<i>your investigation
isn't getting anywhere.</i>

1235
01:07:29,376 --> 01:07:30,445
Huh.

1236
01:08:43,751 --> 01:08:44,853
Lance?

1237
01:08:47,421 --> 01:08:48,456
Lance?

1238
01:08:49,256 --> 01:08:50,856
Oh...

1239
01:08:50,858 --> 01:08:51,991
Did it work?

1240
01:08:51,993 --> 01:08:54,129
Okay, take it easy.

1241
01:08:58,631 --> 01:09:00,400
I got my hands back.

1242
01:09:00,768 --> 01:09:02,500
Yes! Yes!

1243
01:09:02,502 --> 01:09:03,969
Oh, my pecs.

1244
01:09:03,971 --> 01:09:06,170
My pectoral muscles.
My abdominalia.

1245
01:09:06,172 --> 01:09:09,541
Oh, Walter, you are a...

1246
01:09:09,543 --> 01:09:10,545
I just...

1247
01:09:11,412 --> 01:09:13,879
I can do that
'cause I got lips now!

1248
01:09:15,182 --> 01:09:16,949
I'm naked.

1249
01:09:16,951 --> 01:09:18,383
Little bit awkward.

1250
01:09:18,385 --> 01:09:20,285
Lucky for you,
I planned ahead.

1251
01:09:20,287 --> 01:09:21,489
Good call.

1252
01:09:26,159 --> 01:09:27,492
There he is.

1253
01:09:27,494 --> 01:09:28,960
Lance Sterling.
Back in action.

1254
01:09:30,331 --> 01:09:32,567
<i>You have
arrived at your destination.</i>

1255
01:09:33,367 --> 01:09:34,769
All right, Robo Hand.

1256
01:09:35,770 --> 01:09:37,438
I'm coming for you.

1257
01:10:06,367 --> 01:10:10,035
Okay. Robo Hand
is a mile due west.

1258
01:10:10,037 --> 01:10:11,504
So, what's the plan,
partner?

1259
01:10:11,506 --> 01:10:14,973
I got plenty of glitter,
yay-palm, a splat-a-pult...

1260
01:10:14,975 --> 01:10:16,508
No.

1261
01:10:16,510 --> 01:10:17,509
No what?

1262
01:10:17,511 --> 01:10:19,378
I'm taking it
from here, Walter.

1263
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:20,879
You're kidding, right?

1264
01:10:20,881 --> 01:10:22,647
Look, lives are on the line.

1265
01:10:22,649 --> 01:10:23,782
I got this now.

1266
01:10:23,784 --> 01:10:25,217
You've got this?

1267
01:10:25,219 --> 01:10:27,385
But we're a team.
You said so yourself.

1268
01:10:27,387 --> 01:10:28,786
And you did your job.

1269
01:10:28,788 --> 01:10:30,187
You un-birded me.

1270
01:10:30,189 --> 01:10:32,991
Now it's time
to do things my way.

1271
01:10:32,993 --> 01:10:34,992
End this fool.

1272
01:10:34,994 --> 01:10:36,661
That's wrong.

1273
01:10:36,663 --> 01:10:38,330
You're so wrong.

1274
01:10:38,332 --> 01:10:39,764
Look, I've got
everything that we...

1275
01:10:39,766 --> 01:10:43,403
This is not the place
for your weird gadgets.

1276
01:10:44,971 --> 01:10:46,306
Weird?

1277
01:10:50,042 --> 01:10:51,679
Go home.

1278
01:10:55,448 --> 01:10:56,451
No.

1279
01:10:57,150 --> 01:10:59,621
I'm not giving up. Ow.

1280
01:11:03,923 --> 01:11:05,924
Lance...

1281
01:11:05,926 --> 01:11:08,930
I can't lose
any more good people.

1282
01:11:21,975 --> 01:11:23,577
I fly solo.

1283
01:12:22,336 --> 01:12:23,871
Ow!

1284
01:13:00,573 --> 01:13:02,641
I think that's yours.

1285
01:13:02,643 --> 01:13:06,311
But that face
you've been using is mine.

1286
01:13:06,313 --> 01:13:07,711
It's over.

1287
01:13:07,713 --> 01:13:09,915
Database isn't gonna
do you any good

1288
01:13:09,917 --> 01:13:12,518
with your fancy toy
messed up like that.

1289
01:13:14,787 --> 01:13:18,590
You really thought
I was gonna use one drone...

1290
01:13:18,592 --> 01:13:21,796
to take out every name
on this list?

1291
01:13:22,764 --> 01:13:24,463
I mean, I did.

1292
01:13:24,465 --> 01:13:27,165
Until you asked
that question that way.

1293
01:13:27,167 --> 01:13:28,599
Casts a little doubt.

1294
01:13:28,601 --> 01:13:30,505
Tell me, Agent Sterling.

1295
01:13:33,774 --> 01:13:35,743
You managed
to stop one drone.

1296
01:13:39,512 --> 01:13:42,082
How do you plan
on stopping 1,000?

1297
01:13:53,895 --> 01:13:55,797
Sleepy night-night.

1298
01:14:08,108 --> 01:14:09,241
Huh?

1299
01:14:16,684 --> 01:14:18,349
Do you feel
that dread?

1300
01:14:18,351 --> 01:14:19,918
Oh, can you feel it?

1301
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:25,324
Rolling around you
like a fog.

1302
01:14:25,326 --> 01:14:27,459
I told you.
I don't even know you, man.

1303
01:14:27,461 --> 01:14:30,595
But I know you.

1304
01:14:30,597 --> 01:14:31,998
Think about it.

1305
01:14:32,733 --> 01:14:33,665
No?

1306
01:14:33,667 --> 01:14:35,502
I'll give you
a little bit of help.

1307
01:14:38,572 --> 01:14:40,007
Kyrgyzstan.

1308
01:14:41,475 --> 01:14:43,142
Ah...

1309
01:14:43,144 --> 01:14:44,642
He remembers.

1310
01:14:44,644 --> 01:14:47,211
I mean, I certainly
never forgot that day.

1311
01:14:47,213 --> 01:14:50,081
You were magnificent.

1312
01:14:50,083 --> 01:14:52,217
You were a one-man army.

1313
01:14:52,219 --> 01:14:53,986
Lot of witty
catchphrases...

1314
01:14:53,988 --> 01:14:58,926
and you had all these fancy
toys that just went boom!

1315
01:15:00,060 --> 01:15:01,162
Boom.

1316
01:15:03,262 --> 01:15:05,065
Boom.

1317
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:08,967
You were a bunch
of bad dudes

1318
01:15:08,969 --> 01:15:11,870
about to hurt
a lot of innocent people.

1319
01:15:11,872 --> 01:15:15,272
And it's my job
to keep everyone safe.

1320
01:15:15,274 --> 01:15:17,911
Everyone?

1321
01:15:19,212 --> 01:15:25,550
I watched every single
one of my people die...

1322
01:15:25,552 --> 01:15:30,757
as your agency's weapons
rained down on us.

1323
01:15:34,528 --> 01:15:37,131
You took everything
from me.

1324
01:15:40,367 --> 01:15:42,570
And you know the rules.

1325
01:15:44,505 --> 01:15:47,173
You hit me hard, Sterling.

1326
01:15:50,010 --> 01:15:52,646
I hit back harder.

1327
01:16:04,692 --> 01:16:06,560
All of this...

1328
01:16:09,262 --> 01:16:11,966
because of you.

1329
01:16:23,676 --> 01:16:25,779
He's coming back
for me.

1330
01:16:28,148 --> 01:16:31,083
Walter, no.
No, no, no.

1331
01:16:31,085 --> 01:16:32,150
Walter.

1332
01:16:32,152 --> 01:16:34,221
No, no, no.
Okay.

1333
01:16:39,393 --> 01:16:42,727
Hey, this kid is harmless.

1334
01:16:42,729 --> 01:16:45,429
He doesn't have anything
to do with this, okay?

1335
01:16:45,431 --> 01:16:46,563
We can figure this out.

1336
01:16:46,565 --> 01:16:47,699
Look at me, look at me.

1337
01:16:47,701 --> 01:16:49,701
I'm sorry, all right?

1338
01:16:49,703 --> 01:16:51,236
There's another way!

1339
01:16:51,238 --> 01:16:52,239
Do you hear me?

1340
01:16:56,877 --> 01:16:58,613
Do not hurt this kid.

1341
01:17:02,548 --> 01:17:03,682
Oh, no.

1342
01:17:03,684 --> 01:17:04,918
Don't...
Don't do this.

1343
01:17:05,886 --> 01:17:07,919
- Please.
- No, no, no.

1344
01:17:07,921 --> 01:17:09,690
- Don't do this!
- No!

1345
01:17:13,260 --> 01:17:14,729
No!

1346
01:17:21,033 --> 01:17:23,938
I'm taking
everything from you.

1347
01:18:52,359 --> 01:18:53,427
Huh?

1348
01:18:59,032 --> 01:19:01,433
Oh, right. Yeah.

1349
01:19:02,668 --> 01:19:04,669
Walter.

1350
01:19:04,671 --> 01:19:06,138
But I saw...

1351
01:19:06,140 --> 01:19:07,171
How did you...

1352
01:19:07,173 --> 01:19:09,777
Oh, you know,
one of my weird gadgets.

1353
01:19:10,778 --> 01:19:13,114
The inflatable hug.

1354
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:15,850
Thought I lost you, man.

1355
01:19:17,050 --> 01:19:19,683
I'll always have
your back, Lance.

1356
01:19:19,685 --> 01:19:22,122
That's what it means
to be a team.

1357
01:19:22,988 --> 01:19:26,059
It's something I learned
a long time ago.

1358
01:19:28,362 --> 01:19:29,363
From your mom?

1359
01:19:32,932 --> 01:19:34,969
You're a good friend, Walter.

1360
01:19:39,573 --> 01:19:44,009
And, hey, I'm sorry
for shooting you in your neck.

1361
01:19:44,011 --> 01:19:47,047
I'm sorry for the cloaca.

1362
01:19:48,948 --> 01:19:52,282
So, what's your plan
to stop this guy?

1363
01:19:52,284 --> 01:19:53,951
Nope. Not my plan.

1364
01:19:53,953 --> 01:19:55,456
Time to do it your way.

1365
01:19:56,355 --> 01:19:57,354
My way?

1366
01:19:57,356 --> 01:19:59,758
Oh, yeah. We about
to Walter-ize this thing.

1367
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:02,093
Well, in that case...

1368
01:20:02,095 --> 01:20:04,129
we're gonna need
a bigger flock.

1369
01:20:04,131 --> 01:20:05,763
You're calling Marcy,
aren't you?

1370
01:20:05,765 --> 01:20:08,234
- Yep.
- Tell her I said hi.

1371
01:20:16,710 --> 01:20:19,177
- Let's get weird.
- Boom.

1372
01:20:32,326 --> 01:20:35,192
Nowhere to run
from this, Lance.

1373
01:20:35,194 --> 01:20:39,296
Listen, I'm sorry about
what happened in Kyrgyzstan.

1374
01:20:39,298 --> 01:20:43,166
But we are stuck in this
good guy-bad guy vortex.

1375
01:20:43,168 --> 01:20:46,437
We do not have
to do it like this.

1376
01:20:46,439 --> 01:20:48,906
Yeah, bit late for that.

1377
01:20:48,908 --> 01:20:50,141
It's not.

1378
01:20:50,143 --> 01:20:52,343
We're both just people
who make mistakes.

1379
01:20:52,345 --> 01:20:54,478
- We can work this out, man.
- That's it.

1380
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:56,915
<i>Almost there.
You're doing great.</i>

1381
01:20:56,917 --> 01:20:58,782
I mean, come on.

1382
01:20:58,784 --> 01:21:01,018
We can break this cycle.

1383
01:21:01,020 --> 01:21:02,653
Got it. I'm connected.

1384
01:21:02,655 --> 01:21:04,388
Nobody else
has to get hurt.

1385
01:21:04,390 --> 01:21:08,127
You should know
better than anyone.

1386
01:21:11,664 --> 01:21:14,365
Someone always gets hurt.

1387
01:21:14,367 --> 01:21:15,436
Not today-day.

1388
01:21:20,173 --> 01:21:22,607
You brought
your own soundtrack?

1389
01:21:22,609 --> 01:21:24,578
We like to make an entrance.

1390
01:21:27,514 --> 01:21:28,647
Huh?

1391
01:21:28,649 --> 01:21:29,917
Oh.

1392
01:21:52,105 --> 01:21:53,172
Huh?

1393
01:21:54,841 --> 01:21:56,741
Would you look at that?

1394
01:21:56,743 --> 01:21:57,875
There's a man
with a robot hand

1395
01:21:57,877 --> 01:21:59,009
wearing your face...

1396
01:21:59,011 --> 01:22:01,178
who took the M9 Assassin.

1397
01:22:01,180 --> 01:22:02,947
Guess I owe you
an apology.

1398
01:22:02,949 --> 01:22:04,316
Okay. Go ahead.

1399
01:22:04,318 --> 01:22:06,852
No, that was it.
That was the apology.

1400
01:22:06,854 --> 01:22:08,519
Oh. I accept.

1401
01:22:13,092 --> 01:22:15,660
But you gotta admit,
it was a little Scooby-Doo.

1402
01:22:15,662 --> 01:22:17,629
Oh, 100% Scooby-Doo.

1403
01:22:17,631 --> 01:22:20,200
I'm gonna make this hurt!

1404
01:22:26,972 --> 01:22:28,572
Okay, come on through.

1405
01:22:28,574 --> 01:22:30,442
You are safe here. Come on.

1406
01:22:30,444 --> 01:22:31,776
Is that everyone?

1407
01:22:31,778 --> 01:22:34,678
Director, we've got
unknown incoming.

1408
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:35,715
Approaching fast.

1409
01:22:36,783 --> 01:22:38,685
Oh, this is bad.

1410
01:22:48,162 --> 01:22:49,430
Lock this place down.

1411
01:23:06,145 --> 01:23:08,047
We're sitting ducks.

1412
01:23:08,881 --> 01:23:10,248
Walter hacked his hand.

1413
01:23:10,250 --> 01:23:12,215
We gotta buy him some time
to shut down the drones.

1414
01:23:12,217 --> 01:23:14,320
Got it. What kind of
firepower we talking?

1415
01:23:17,890 --> 01:23:19,259
Just go along with it.

1416
01:23:20,627 --> 01:23:21,726
Take your best shot.

1417
01:23:21,728 --> 01:23:23,928
This one sucks.

1418
01:23:26,365 --> 01:23:28,098
<i>No, no, no,
that's binder bubbles.</i>

1419
01:23:28,100 --> 01:23:29,933
<i>Push the button on the back.</i>

1420
01:23:29,935 --> 01:23:32,105
Button on the back,
button on the back!

1421
01:23:38,444 --> 01:23:39,376
Bubbles?

1422
01:23:39,378 --> 01:23:41,711
Oh, you gotta let me
try that.

1423
01:23:41,713 --> 01:23:43,783
<i>That's a collide-oscope.
Throw it.</i>

1424
01:23:57,529 --> 01:23:59,597
Splat-a-pult. Prism spray.
Hypno-stars.

1425
01:23:59,599 --> 01:24:01,999
Snorepedo. Scream Team.

1426
01:24:02,001 --> 01:24:04,468
Well, what have we
got to lose?

1427
01:24:07,006 --> 01:24:08,473
11 o'clock.

1428
01:24:08,475 --> 01:24:11,545
12 o'clock.
Half past 2! 4:30!

1429
01:24:12,645 --> 01:24:14,812
<i>Security blanket.</i>

1430
01:24:14,814 --> 01:24:17,380
<i>It's upside down.</i>

1431
01:24:17,382 --> 01:24:18,950
<i>I'm a hugger.</i>

1432
01:24:18,952 --> 01:24:20,320
Whoa.

1433
01:24:26,792 --> 01:24:27,857
Nice shot.

1434
01:24:31,898 --> 01:24:33,498
Thank you?

1435
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:35,465
Walter, gonna need
a reload, buddy.

1436
01:24:35,467 --> 01:24:37,735
<i>Ask and you shall receive.</i>

1437
01:24:37,737 --> 01:24:39,773
Are those pigeons
wearing tiny backpacks?

1438
01:24:40,606 --> 01:24:42,173
<i>Yay!</i>

1439
01:24:42,175 --> 01:24:44,344
Now, that's hot.
That's hot.

1440
01:24:45,444 --> 01:24:47,812
I call it Fifty Shades of Yay!

1441
01:24:47,814 --> 01:24:49,947
Oh, come on, now!

1442
01:24:49,949 --> 01:24:51,482
You ready
to tap out yet?

1443
01:25:09,636 --> 01:25:10,701
Gadget lab.

1444
01:25:10,703 --> 01:25:14,407
Get to the gadget lab!
Grab every weapon you can!

1445
01:25:15,175 --> 01:25:17,277
Stop! Get back!

1446
01:25:19,045 --> 01:25:20,780
Oh, no.

1447
01:25:27,154 --> 01:25:29,186
<i>Yay!</i>

1448
01:25:29,188 --> 01:25:30,390
<i>I'm a hugger.</i>

1449
01:25:35,628 --> 01:25:38,763
Walter, my face
can't take much more of this.

1450
01:25:38,765 --> 01:25:40,397
You keep doing your thing
and I'll do mine.

1451
01:25:40,399 --> 01:25:41,464
Yeah, well, your thing
seems to be

1452
01:25:41,466 --> 01:25:42,866
a lot easier
than my thing.

1453
01:25:42,868 --> 01:25:44,268
We have
different skillsets.

1454
01:25:44,270 --> 01:25:45,736
That's what makes us
such a great team.

1455
01:25:45,738 --> 01:25:46,739
Dude.

1456
01:26:05,958 --> 01:26:07,558
- Excuse me.
- Ugh.

1457
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:09,393
Whoo.
Why do I smell lavender?

1458
01:26:09,395 --> 01:26:10,961
We just got spritzed.

1459
01:26:10,963 --> 01:26:12,330
Uh-oh. Truth serum.

1460
01:26:12,332 --> 01:26:13,598
I have five cats,

1461
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:15,031
each named after a member
of New Kids on the Block.

1462
01:26:15,033 --> 01:26:16,166
Oh, I love New Kids.

1463
01:26:16,168 --> 01:26:17,468
Jon, Joey, Jordan,
Donnie, and Danny.

1464
01:26:17,470 --> 01:26:19,638
I really wanna
hurt you right now.

1465
01:26:24,677 --> 01:26:25,610
You.

1466
01:26:25,612 --> 01:26:27,911
What...
What are you doing?

1467
01:26:27,913 --> 01:26:29,179
I'm not
telling you anything.

1468
01:26:29,181 --> 01:26:30,248
I'll tell you
what he's doing.

1469
01:26:30,250 --> 01:26:31,315
He's gonna hack
into your claw

1470
01:26:31,317 --> 01:26:32,549
and shut down
your drones.

1471
01:26:32,551 --> 01:26:34,619
Wow, this stuff
really works.

1472
01:26:42,095 --> 01:26:43,297
No, no, no.

1473
01:26:46,132 --> 01:26:48,031
No!

1474
01:26:54,541 --> 01:26:56,510
- Whoa!
- I'm coming, Walter.

1475
01:27:04,951 --> 01:27:07,721
Almost there. Don't let go.
Please don't let go.

1476
01:27:16,229 --> 01:27:18,862
Walter!

1477
01:27:24,203 --> 01:27:25,439
Walter.

1478
01:27:35,881 --> 01:27:37,317
Come on, come on.

1479
01:27:42,021 --> 01:27:43,789
Somebody do something.

1480
01:27:53,533 --> 01:27:56,970
If you shut 'em down now,
you'll kill us both.

1481
01:28:01,106 --> 01:28:03,010
And you're no killer.

1482
01:28:06,813 --> 01:28:09,246
No. I'm a hugger.

1483
01:28:09,248 --> 01:28:10,516
What?

1484
01:28:15,154 --> 01:28:20,661
<i>One day, your gadgets
are gonna keep the world safe.</i>

1485
01:28:43,684 --> 01:28:44,915
- Yes!
- Yes!

1486
01:28:44,917 --> 01:28:46,786
Never wash
that hand again!

1487
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:03,535
I got you, Walter!

1488
01:29:03,537 --> 01:29:05,905
Lance? What are you...

1489
01:29:08,373 --> 01:29:09,941
It's okay.

1490
01:29:09,943 --> 01:29:11,478
It's okay.

1491
01:29:12,011 --> 01:29:13,747
You can't do this alone.

1492
01:29:14,914 --> 01:29:16,382
I am not alone!

1493
01:29:18,016 --> 01:29:19,784
Lovey?

1494
01:29:21,921 --> 01:29:23,356
Come on, birds!

1495
01:29:25,692 --> 01:29:26,960
Fly!

1496
01:29:51,951 --> 01:29:53,153
Walter.

1497
01:29:53,653 --> 01:29:55,486
Walter.

1498
01:29:57,856 --> 01:30:00,724
What does internal
bleeding feel like?

1499
01:30:00,726 --> 01:30:03,260
This.
It feels like this.

1500
01:30:03,262 --> 01:30:04,394
Oh, come here.

1501
01:30:04,396 --> 01:30:05,897
No, no, no. No hugs.

1502
01:30:05,899 --> 01:30:06,798
You gonna make me

1503
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:09,099
lay an egg or something
in front of Marcy.

1504
01:30:14,439 --> 01:30:16,041
Huh?

1505
01:30:21,479 --> 01:30:23,549
He saved him.

1506
01:30:26,318 --> 01:30:29,286
I think I need a vet.

1507
01:30:29,288 --> 01:30:32,257
Once I can move again,
I'll turn you back into a man.

1508
01:30:32,259 --> 01:30:33,791
Sterling.

1509
01:30:33,793 --> 01:30:35,192
You're a bird?

1510
01:30:35,194 --> 01:30:36,727
Uh, hey, Marcy.

1511
01:30:36,729 --> 01:30:39,062
That's why
I couldn't find you!

1512
01:30:41,967 --> 01:30:44,500
Whoa, you're a bird.
That is messed up.

1513
01:30:44,502 --> 01:30:45,836
It's weird, right?

1514
01:30:45,838 --> 01:30:46,969
This is amazing.

1515
01:30:46,971 --> 01:30:47,905
We did it.

1516
01:30:47,907 --> 01:30:50,508
We took down the drones,
beat the bad guy,

1517
01:30:50,510 --> 01:30:51,909
saved countless lives.

1518
01:30:51,911 --> 01:30:54,480
We are so gonna get
our jobs back!

1519
01:30:56,916 --> 01:30:58,849
So, triple fired.

1520
01:30:58,851 --> 01:31:01,919
Yeah, man, that's gotta
be some kind of record.

1521
01:31:01,921 --> 01:31:03,853
I really didn't see
that coming.

1522
01:31:03,855 --> 01:31:07,891
Well, we did break a bunch of
laws, and defied orders...

1523
01:31:07,893 --> 01:31:10,361
and, I mean, committed
a little bit of treason.

1524
01:31:10,363 --> 01:31:12,095
Oh, right, yeah,
the treason.

1525
01:31:12,097 --> 01:31:13,798
Forgot about
the treason.

1526
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:16,901
Hey.
It doesn't matter, man.

1527
01:31:16,903 --> 01:31:18,169
Look around.

1528
01:31:20,072 --> 01:31:23,510
Your mother would be
so proud of you right now.

1529
01:31:25,377 --> 01:31:27,814
You kept
all those people safe.

1530
01:31:29,448 --> 01:31:31,750
And you did it your way.

1531
01:31:32,719 --> 01:31:35,419
But you also did this.

1532
01:31:35,421 --> 01:31:36,920
Yeah.

1533
01:31:36,922 --> 01:31:39,757
I'll figure that out.
Sorry.

1534
01:31:39,759 --> 01:31:41,592
You know,
this gluten-free stuff

1535
01:31:41,594 --> 01:31:43,195
is really starting
to grow on me.

1536
01:31:45,698 --> 01:31:47,363
So, what do we do now?

1537
01:31:47,365 --> 01:31:49,569
Oh, we could...

1538
01:31:52,939 --> 01:31:54,772
Huh?

1539
01:31:54,774 --> 01:31:55,805
Marcy?

1540
01:31:55,807 --> 01:31:57,907
Okay,
I can't see or hear...

1541
01:31:57,909 --> 01:32:02,146
but my other senses are
elevated, so you... Ow!

1542
01:32:02,148 --> 01:32:05,450
<i>Agent Sterling,
I apologize for the theatrics.</i>

1543
01:32:05,452 --> 01:32:06,718
No, you don't.

1544
01:32:06,720 --> 01:32:08,451
You should have seen your
face when we grabbed you.

1545
01:32:08,453 --> 01:32:09,887
I didn't make a face.

1546
01:32:09,889 --> 01:32:11,354
No one's ever looked
more scared.

1547
01:32:11,356 --> 01:32:12,490
<i>Are you two finished?</i>

1548
01:32:12,492 --> 01:32:14,090
We are gonna
be okay, Lance!

1549
01:32:14,092 --> 01:32:16,626
Use your baby hand
to pick the lock!

1550
01:32:16,628 --> 01:32:19,330
<i>Can you please
take that off him?</i>

1551
01:32:19,332 --> 01:32:21,499
Okay, and you can...

1552
01:32:21,501 --> 01:32:23,901
Oh, hey. Hey, guys.

1553
01:32:23,903 --> 01:32:26,603
Is this about the treason?

1554
01:32:26,605 --> 01:32:28,606
Joy, what is going on?

1555
01:32:28,608 --> 01:32:30,875
<i>We realize
we were wrong about you.</i>

1556
01:32:30,877 --> 01:32:33,009
<i>You're the future
of this agency,</i>

1557
01:32:33,011 --> 01:32:34,745
<i>and we want you
to lead a new team.</i>

1558
01:32:34,747 --> 01:32:36,914
<i>A highly covert global...</i>

1559
01:32:36,916 --> 01:32:38,749
Let me stop you
right there.

1560
01:32:38,751 --> 01:32:40,584
I'm not leading nothing,

1561
01:32:40,586 --> 01:32:43,187
unless my man
Walter's on the team.

1562
01:32:43,189 --> 01:32:44,421
Um...

1563
01:32:44,423 --> 01:32:46,757
I think
she's talking to Walter.

1564
01:32:46,759 --> 01:32:49,559
- Oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah, we...
- Just put that down.

1565
01:32:49,561 --> 01:32:50,626
Sometimes,
he talks for me,

1566
01:32:50,628 --> 01:32:51,995
I'll talk for him,
'cause we a team.

1567
01:32:51,997 --> 01:32:53,130
Me?

1568
01:32:53,132 --> 01:32:55,299
<i>We need people like you.</i>

1569
01:32:55,301 --> 01:32:59,338
<i>People who can help the
Agency do things a new way.</i>

1570
01:33:00,006 --> 01:33:01,207
<i>What do you say?</i>

1571
01:33:02,675 --> 01:33:04,911
Looks like we gonna
need some glitter.

1572
01:33:05,978 --> 01:33:06,910
Team Weird?

1573
01:33:06,912 --> 01:33:08,213
Team Weird.

1574
01:33:11,184 --> 01:33:13,219
<i>Missile deactivated.</i>

1575
01:33:23,899 --> 01:33:28,899
