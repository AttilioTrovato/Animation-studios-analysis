1
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:56,068
Why not call it the Big Chill
or the Nippy Era?

2
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:59,154
I'm just sayin',
how do we know it's an ice age?

3
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,282
Because of all the ice!

4
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:06,995
Well, things just got a little chillier.

5
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:10,624
Help. Help.

6
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:14,002
Come on, kids. Let's go.
The traffic's movin'.

7
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,380
But, Dad...

8
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:19,299
No buts.
You can play extinction later.

9
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:23,011
OK. Come on, guys.

10
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,347
So, where's Eddie?

11
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:29,268
He said something about being
on the verge of an evolutionary breakthrough.

12
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,019
Really?

13
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,564
I'm flying!

14
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,068
Some breakthrough.

15
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:42,698
- Look out!
- You're going the wrong way.

16
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,033
Crazy mammoth!

17
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:56,253
Hey! Do the world a favour.
Move your issues off the road.

18
00:04:56,337 --> 00:05:00,966
If my trunk was that small,
I wouldn't draw attention to myself, pal.

19
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,720
Give me a break.
We've been waddlin' all day.

20
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:09,308
Go ahead, follow the crowd.

21
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,685
It'll be quieter when you're gone.

22
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:16,064
Come on. If he wants to
freeze to death, let him.

23
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:28,118
I'm up.

24
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:33,165
Rise and shine, everybody.

25
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:35,667
Zak? Marshall?

26
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:39,046
Bertie? Uncle Fungus?

27
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:42,966
Where is everybody?
Come on, guys, we're gonna miss the mi...

28
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:46,094
the mi... gration.

29
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:52,851
They left without me.
They do this every year.

30
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:57,272
Why? Doesn't anyone love me?

31
00:05:57,315 --> 00:06:02,069
Isn't there anyone
who cares about Sid the Sloth?

32
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:06,948
All right, I'll just go by myself.

33
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:10,786
Sick!

34
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:13,955
Hey, wide body!
Kerb it next time.

35
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,583
Oh, jeez.
Oh, yuck!

36
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,586
I can't believe it.
Fresh wild greens.

37
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,464
Frank, where did you ever...?

38
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:25,675
- Go ahead. Dig in.
- A dandelion.

39
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,346
- I thought the frost wiped 'em all out.
- All but one.

40
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:34,643
It makes me so...
I wanna... Yuck.

41
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:39,189
This has definitely not been my day.
You know what I'm sayin', buddy?

42
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:43,318
What a mess. You rhinos have
really tiny brains. Did you know that?

43
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:48,323
It's just a fact. No offence. You probably
don't even know what I'm talkin' about.

44
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:50,534
Yummo.

45
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:54,329
A dandelion.
Must be the last one of the season.

46
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,167
- Carl...
- Easy, Frank.

47
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,753
He ruined our salad.

48
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:05,590
My mistake.
That was my mistake. Let me...

49
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,718
Seriously, let me take care of this.

50
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,471
What is this?
Pine cones.

51
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:14,516
Oh, my goodness.
They're my favourite.

52
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:20,063
Delicious.
That's good eating.

53
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:23,692
But don't let me hog them all up.
Here, you have some.

54
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:26,820
Tasty, isn't it?
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

55
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:28,989
Now?

56
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:31,575
Now.

57
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:45,547
- Just pretend that I'm not here.
- I wanted to hit him at full speed.

58
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:50,927
- That's OK. We'll have some fun with him.
- Don't let them impale me. I wanna live.

59
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:53,930
- Get off me.
- Come on, you're makin' a scene.

60
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:57,225
We'll just take our furry piñata and go.

61
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,353
Buddy, if it's not them today,
it's just someone else tomorrow.

62
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:02,856
Well, I'd rather it not be today. OK?

63
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:06,318
Look, we'll break your neck
so you don't feel a thing. How's that?

64
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:09,488
Wait a minute.
I thought rhinos were vegetarians.

65
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,740
- An excellent point.
- Shut up.

66
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:14,409
Who says we're gonna eat him
after we kill him?

67
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:15,494
Yeah, move it.

68
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:18,455
You know, I don't like animals
that kill for pleasure.

69
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:21,958
- Save it for a mammal that cares.
- I'm a mammal that cares.

70
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:27,547
OK, if either of you make it across that
sinkhole in front of ya, you get the sloth.

71
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:31,301
That's right, you losers.
You take one step and you're dead.

72
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:39,476
- You were bluffing, huh?
- Yeah, that was a bluff.

73
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:42,020
Get him!

74
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,225
A dandelion?

75
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:25,814
We did it!

76
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:37,784
- You have beautiful eyes.
- Get off my face.

77
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:42,664
Whoa, you and me, we make a great team.
What do you say we head south together?

78
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,166
Great. Jump on my back
and relax the whole way.

79
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,294
- Wow, really?
- No.

80
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:51,881
Wait, aren't you going south?
The change of seasons, migration instincts.

81
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,759
- Any of this a-ringin' a bell?
- I guess not. Bye.

82
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,762
OK, then. Thanks for the help.
I can take it from here.

83
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:02,517
Hey, you overgrown weasel.
Wait till we get down there.

84
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:07,063
That whole south thing is way overrated.
The heat, the crowds - who needs it?

85
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:11,735
Isn't this great? You and me,
two bachelors knockin' about in the wild.

86
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:15,655
No. You just want a bodyguard
so you don't become somebody's side dish.

87
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:18,033
You're a very shrewd mammal.

88
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:21,077
OK then, you lead the way, Mr Big...
Didn't get the name.

89
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:23,038
- Manfred.
- Yuck.

90
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:29,210
How about Manny the Moody Mammoth?
Or Manny the Melancholy... Manny the...

91
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,089
Stop following me.

92
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:40,513
OK, so you've got issues. You won't
even know I'm here. I'll just zip the lip.

93
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:28,603
Look at the cute little baby, Diego.

94
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:36,444
- Isn't it nice he'll be joining us for breakfast?
- It wouldn't be breakfast without him.

95
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:42,283
Especially since his daddy wiped out half
our pack and wears our skin to keep warm.

96
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,495
An eye for an eye, don't you think?

97
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:49,165
Let's show that human what happens
when he messes with sabres.

98
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:53,420
Alert the troops.
We attack at dawn.

99
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:58,091
And, Diego, bring me that baby alive.

100
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:03,513
If I'm gonna enjoy my revenge,
I want it to be fresh.

101
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,997
- I'm wiped out.
- That's your shelter?

102
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:32,000
You're a big guy.
You got a lotta wood. I'm a little guy.

103
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,918
You got half a stick.

104
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:40,383
But with my little stick and my highly
evolved brain, I shall create fire.

105
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,594
Fascinating.

106
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:47,599
We'll see if brains triumph
over brawn tonight. Now, won't we?

107
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:54,355
Think I saw a spark.

108
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:02,405
Any chance I could squeeze
in there with you, Manny, ol' pal?

109
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,408
Isn't there someone else you can annoy?

110
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:09,037
Friends? Family?
Poisonous reptiles?

111
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:14,125
My family abandoned me.
They just kinda migrated without me.

112
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,544
You should see what they did last year.

113
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:19,714
They woke up early
and tied my hands and feet

114
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:22,592
and they gagged me with a fieldmouse,
and barricaded the cave door,

115
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:26,304
covered their tracks,
went through water so I'd lose their scent,

116
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:29,557
and... who needs 'em, anyway?

117
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:36,564
So what about you?
You have family?

118
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:43,530
OK, you're tired. I see.
Well, we'll talk more in the morning.

119
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,784
Manfred?

120
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:50,537
Could you scooch over a drop?

121
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:53,706
Come on.
Nobody falls asleep that fast.

122
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:55,750
Manny!

123
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:49,007
There's Diego. Fall back.

124
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:58,307
- Where's the baby?
- I lost it over the falls.

125
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,102
You lost it?

126
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:06,524
- I want that baby.
- I'll get it.

127
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:10,319
You'd better, unless you want
to serve yourself as a replacement.

128
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:14,949
We'll go up to Half Peak.
Meet us there.

129
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,660
It had better be alive.

130
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:21,039
Can we trust you with that, Diego?

131
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:23,624
Let's go!

132
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:50,234
She picked a hair off my shoulder and says,
"If you're gonna have an extra mating dance,

133
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,904
at least pick a female
with the same colour pelt."

134
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:56,199
I thought, "She's gonna go
praying mantis on me."

135
00:17:56,283 --> 00:18:00,495
If you find a mate in life, you should be loyal.
In your case, grateful.

136
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:03,539
- Now get away from me.
- I think mating for life is stupid.

137
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:06,584
There's plenty of Sid to go around.

138
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:11,297
Manny?

139
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:08,729
Look at that. He's OK.

140
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,742
She's gone.

141
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:34,672
Hey, Manny. Are you forgetting something?

142
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,007
No.

143
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:40,178
- But you just saved him.
- I'm trying to get rid of the last thing I saved.

144
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,763
But you can't leave him here.

145
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:50,271
Look, there's smoke.
That's his herd right up the hill.

146
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:54,483
- We should return him.
- Let's get this straight. There is no "we".

147
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:59,322
There never was a "we".
In fact, without me, there wouldn't be a "you".

148
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:07,997
- Just up the hill.
- Listen very carefully. I'm not going.

149
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:13,961
- Fine, be a jerk. I'll take care of him.
- Oh, yeah. That's good.

150
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,714
You can't even take care of yourself.
This, I gotta see.

151
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:21,052
I'll return you. We don't need
that meany-weany mammoth, do we?

152
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:23,262
No, we don't.

153
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:55,044
You're an embarrassment to nature.
Do you know that?

154
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:59,507
This is cake. I'm fine.

155
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:01,342
I'm gonna die.

156
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,066
Manny!

157
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:34,709
- That pink thing is mine.
- Actually, that pink thing belongs to us.

158
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:41,215
"Us"? You two are a bit of an odd couple.

159
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:43,050
There is no "us".

160
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:46,220
I see. Can't have one of your own,
so you want to adopt.

161
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:49,640
Look, I'm sorry to interrupt
your snack, but we gotta go.

162
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:53,394
The baby? Please.
I was returning him to his herd.

163
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:56,772
- Nice try, bucktooth.
- You callin' me a liar?

164
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:59,525
- I didn't say that.
- You were thinkin' it.

165
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:03,154
I don't like this cat.
He reads minds.

166
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:06,782
- Name's Diego, friend.
- Manfred, and I'm not your friend.

167
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:10,494
Fine, Manfred.

168
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:14,123
If you're lookin' for the humans,
you're wastin' your time. They left.

169
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:17,418
Thanks for the advice.
Now beat it.

170
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:21,547
All right, I'll help you bring it to its herd,
but promise me to leave me alone after that.

171
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,967
- OK, deal. What's your problem?
- You are my problem.

172
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:29,638
I think you're stressed, so you eat too much.
It's hard to get fat on a vegan diet.

173
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:33,809
I'm not fat. It's all this fur.
It makes me look poofy.

174
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:37,813
All right, you have fat hair.
But when you're ready to talk, I'm here.

175
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:44,111
What are you doin'?
Just drop it on the ledge.

176
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:47,573
- Shouldn't we make sure they found him?
- Good idea.

177
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:50,159
No, no. Wait.

178
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:52,745
Don't spear me.

179
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:58,542
- This is a problem.
- Now what?

180
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:02,171
That's perfect.

181
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,870
- I told you they were gone.
- Well, look who it is.

182
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:37,498
Don't you have some
poor animal to disembowel?

183
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:41,544
They couldn't be far.
I mean, they went this way, or this way?

184
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:44,004
You don't know much
about tracking, do you?

185
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:47,925
I'm a sloth. I see a tree, eat a leaf.
That's my tracking.

186
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:50,344
You didn't miss them by much.

187
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:53,764
It's still green.
They headed north two hours ago.

188
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:56,142
"They headed north two hours ago."

189
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,357
You don't need this aggravation.

190
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:08,237
Give me the baby. I can track
humans down a lot faster than you.

191
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:11,031
And you're just
a good citizen helpin' out, right?

192
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:14,577
- I just know where the humans are going.
- Glacier Pass.

193
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:17,580
Everybody knows they have
a settlement on the other side.

194
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:24,170
Unless you know how to track, you'll never
reach them before snow closes the pass.

195
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:27,214
Which should be, like, tomorrow.

196
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:33,304
So, you can give that baby to me,
or go get lost in a blizzard. It's your choice.

197
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:43,898
Here's your little bundle of joy.
We're returning it to the humans.

198
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:49,820
The big, bad tigey-wigey gets left behind.
Poor tigey-wigey.

199
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:52,781
Sid, tigey-wigey is gonna lead the way.

200
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:59,872
- Manny, can I talk to you for a second?
- No.

201
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:03,918
The sooner we find the humans,
the sooner I get rid of Mr Stinky Drool-Face,

202
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:06,587
and the baby, too.

203
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:10,257
You won't always have
Jumbo around to protect you.

204
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:16,013
And when that day comes, I suggest you
watch your back, cos I'll be chewin' on it.

205
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:19,850
Hey, über-tracker.
Up front, where I can see you.

206
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,519
Help me.

207
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:40,955
You gotta make it stop.
I can't take it any more.

208
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:45,292
- I've eaten things that complained less.
- He won't stop squirming.

209
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:47,503
- Watch its head.
- Just put it down.

210
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:50,130
Jeez, "pick him up, put him down..."

211
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:53,676
- Its nose is dry.
- That means something's wrong with it.

212
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,804
- Someone should lick it. Just in case.
- I'll do it.

213
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:59,306
- He's wearing one of those baby thingies.
- So?

214
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:02,184
So if he poops, where does it go?

215
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:08,482
- Humans are disgusting.
- OK, you. Check for poop.

216
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:11,652
- Why am I the poop-checker?
- Because returning him was your idea,

217
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:15,489
because you're small and insignificant,
and because I'll pummel you if you don't.

218
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:18,492
- Why else?
- Now, Sid!

219
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:26,041
Yuck! I mean, my goodness.

220
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:28,502
- Look out. Coming through.
- Watch out!

221
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:31,797
- Stop wavin' that thing around.
- I'm gonna slip.

222
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:40,055
It's clean. Got ya.

223
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:44,018
Will you cut it out?

224
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:47,354
Do that again. He likes it.

225
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:52,443
It's makin' me feel better too.

226
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:56,113
Here, you hold it.

227
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:04,204
Turn him towards me.

228
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:07,541
Where's the baby?

229
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:09,918
There he is.

230
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:13,422
Where's the baby?

231
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:14,548
There he is.

232
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:19,219
Stop it. You're scarin' him.

233
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,809
- I bet he's hungry.
- How about some milk?

234
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:28,896
- I'd love some.
- Not you. The baby.

235
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,690
Well, I ain't exactly lactating right now, pal.

236
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,859
You're a little low on the food chain
to mouth off...

237
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:35,611
Enough!

238
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:42,409
Food.

239
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:54,797
I don't know, but I've been told!

240
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:59,051
End of the world be mighty cold!

241
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:01,929
Prepare for the ice age.

242
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:04,556
Protect the dodo way of life.

243
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:08,936
Survival separates the dodos from the beasts.

244
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:15,025
Prepare for the ice age.

245
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:18,112
- Ice age?
- I've heard of these crackpots.

246
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:23,492
- Intruders!
- Now, don't fall in.

247
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:26,537
- If you do, you will definitely...
- Intruders!

248
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:31,375
..burn and die.

249
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:35,629
Can we have our melon back?
Junior's hungry and...

250
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:39,007
No way. This is our private
stockpile for the ice age.

251
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:42,886
Subarctic temperatures will force us
underground for a billion years.

252
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:45,889
So you got three melons?

253
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:50,936
If you weren't smart enough
to plan ahead, then doom on you.

254
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:54,273
Doom on you.
Doom on you.

255
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:56,233
Get away from me.

256
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,278
Oh, no! No!

257
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:04,324
Retrieve the melon.
Tae kwon dodos, attack!

258
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,755
The melon!

259
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:23,427
There goes our last female.

260
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:33,479
- Got it.
- Don't got it.

261
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:37,941
The last melon.

262
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:08,657
Ah, Sid!
Now we gotta find more food.

263
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:13,954
More to the right.

264
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,874
Look at that. Dinner and a show.

265
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,959
Left!

266
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:28,719
Now to find a meal
befitting a conquering hero.

267
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:35,267
What ho? A foe? Come on.
You want a piece of me?

268
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:41,315
Spoils worthy of such a noble...

269
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,992
Bedtime, squirt.

270
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:03,837
Oh, the triumphant return.

271
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,173
Oh, that.

272
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:11,845
I'm so full. How about a good-night
kiss for your big buddy, Sid?

273
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:15,474
- He's asleep.
- I was talking to you.

274
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:19,353
Fine, I'll tuck myself in.

275
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:28,278
All right, good night.

276
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:52,552
Will you stop it?

277
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:56,098
All right, all right.
I was trying to relax.

278
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,146
Oy.

279
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:54,990
- What the...?
- Slice me. It'll be the last thing you ever do.

280
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:58,368
- I'm workin' here, you waste of fur.
- Frustrated, Diego?

281
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:01,872
Tracking down helpless infants
too difficult for you?

282
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:06,418
- What are you two doin' here?
- Soto's getting tired of waiting.

283
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:11,673
He said, "Come back with the baby,
or don't come back at all."

284
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:15,260
Well, I have a message for Soto.

285
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:18,138
Tell him I'm bringing the baby.

286
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:23,351
And tell him I'm bringing a mammoth.

287
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,730
- A mammoth?
- Mammoths never travel alone.

288
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:31,151
This one does,
and I'm leading him to Half Peak.

289
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,738
Look at all that meat.
Let's get him.

290
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:39,117
Not yet. We'll need the whole pack
to bring this mammoth down.

291
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,828
Get everyone ready.

292
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:43,997
Now.

293
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:10,774
- Where's the baby?
- You lost it?

294
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:13,193
Sid!

295
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:17,614
It's so ugly.
Positively adorable.

296
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:21,660
Hello, pumpkin.
Hello, little baldy bean.

297
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:25,789
- Where'd you find it?
- The poor kid, all alone in the wild.

298
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:28,125
Sabres were closing in on him.

299
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:31,378
- So I just snatched him.
- So brave.

300
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:36,091
Yeah, well... He needed me,
and I only wish I had one of my own, too.

301
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:40,137
Really? I find that attractive in a male.

302
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:44,599
Alas. Who wouldn't want
a family, I always say.

303
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:48,395
- Where've you been hiding?
- Yeah, well... You know...

304
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:56,236
Cute kid, huh?
So, as I was saying, ladies...

305
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:02,409
- Hi, Manny.
- What's the matter with you?

306
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:08,331
Excuse me, ladies. You just keep
marinating and I'll be right back.

307
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:11,918
Sexy.

308
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,298
He's not much to look at,
but it's so hard to find a family guy.

309
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:19,926
Tell me about it.
All the sensitive ones get eaten.

310
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:24,055
No, no, no, Manny.
Please, I'm begging you. I need him.

311
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:26,349
What? A good-lookin' guy like you?

312
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:29,561
- You say that, but you don't mean it.
- No, seriously. Look at you.

313
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:32,272
Those ladies, they don't stand a chance.

314
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:35,901
- You have a very cruel sense of humour.
- Don't let me cramp your style.

315
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:37,777
Thanks. You're a pal.

316
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:41,448
- Without Pinky.
- Manny, I need him.

317
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:48,038
So, ladies, where were we?

318
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:51,958
- Carl...
- Easy, Frank.

319
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:58,089
Pretty tail walks by, suddenly he moves
like a cheetah. And that tiger...

320
00:36:58,132 --> 00:37:01,968
Yeah, Mr Great Tracker.
Can't even find a sloth.

321
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:05,931
What am I, the wet nurse?
What are you lookin' at, bone bag?

322
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:11,937
Look at you. You're gonna
grow into a great predator.

323
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:16,691
I don't think so. What have you got?
You got a little patch of fur.

324
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:19,319
No fangs, no claws.

325
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:24,991
You're folds of skin wrapped in mush.
What's so threatening about you?

326
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:34,000
Does this look like
a petting zoo to you? Huh?

327
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:40,548
OK. All right, wise guy.
You just earned a time-out.

328
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:46,680
You think that's funny?
How about this?

329
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:50,558
A little snack for the owls.

330
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:56,564
You're a brave little squirt,
I'll give you that.

331
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,030
Thank goodness.

332
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:07,033
Oh, no! A tiger.

333
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:09,619
Help! Help!

334
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:11,997
- Where's the baby?
- Manfred has him.

335
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:15,041
Just put me in your mouth.
Come on, hurry up.

336
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:18,169
He got me. Help.

337
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:22,340
- Get away from me.
- It went this way. Over here.

338
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:35,061
No, Carl...
The tiger beat us to him.

339
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:38,231
Wait a minute.

340
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:47,907
- He's dead all right.
- No... Carnivores have all the fun.

341
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:54,956
Oh, gosh. I hate breaking their hearts
like that. But you know how it is.

342
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:59,210
All right, thanks.
You can put me down now.

343
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:01,504
Manny!

344
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:03,757
Guys, I thought we were in a hurry.

345
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:07,761
And, Diego, spit that out.
You don't know where it's been.

346
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:12,766
Boy. For a second there,
I actually thought you were gonna eat me.

347
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:15,935
- I don't eat junk food.
- Thought you were gonna...

348
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:18,980
I thought you were gonna... Were you?

349
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:24,110
Come on, wait up.

350
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:27,530
Can you wait a second, please?
Hey, fellas...

351
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,785
Thanks for waiting.

352
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:34,537
Three, two, one...

353
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:39,918
Sure is faithful.

354
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:56,518
- Don't make me reach back.
- He started it.

355
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:58,812
I don't care who started it.
I'll finish it.

356
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:35,515
Modern architecture.
It'll never last.

357
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:52,031
Hiya, Manny.

358
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:56,202
Hi, Diego.

359
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:05,211
Hey, Sid.

360
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:09,299
- You're lost, aren't you?
- No, I know exactly where we are.

361
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:11,718
Ask him directions.

362
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:14,471
- I don't need directions.
- Fine. I'll ask him.

363
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:17,932
Buddy, you see any humans go by here?

364
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:23,855
I love this game. OK, OK...

365
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:28,401
Three words.
First word. Stomp. No. Stamp.

366
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:30,570
Let me try...
Pack.

367
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:34,949
Good one, Manny.
Pack of... Long teeth and claws.

368
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:38,536
Pack of wolves?
Pack of...

369
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:41,331
Pack of bears?
Pack of fleas?

370
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:43,458
Pack of whiskers?
Pack of noses?

371
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:46,002
- Pachyderm?
- Pack of lies.

372
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:48,004
Pack of troubles.
Pack a wallop.

373
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:50,798
Pack of birds.
Pack of flying fish.

374
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:43,226
Hey, great news.
I found a short cut.

375
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:50,149
- What do you mean, short cut?
- I mean faster than the long way around.

376
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,569
I know what a short cut is.

377
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:57,824
Look, either we beat the humans to Glacier
Pass or we take the long way and miss 'em.

378
00:42:57,866 --> 00:43:01,744
Through there?
What do you take me for?

379
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:05,248
This time tomorrow,
you could be a free mammoth.

380
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:08,293
Or a nanny.
Personally, I never get tired of peekaboo.

381
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:11,296
Hey, guys. Check this out.

382
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:15,633
Sid, the tiger found a short cut.

383
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:23,099
- No, thanks. I choose life.
- Then I suggest you take the short cut.

384
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:26,394
- Are you threatening me?
- Move, sloth!

385
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:33,443
Way to go, tiger.

386
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:36,821
Quick. Inside.

387
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:02,805
OK, I vote short cut.

388
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:20,782
Come on, guys. Stick together.
It's easy to get lost in here.

389
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,424
Guys?

390
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:57,777
A fish.

391
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:45,324
Will you keep up, please?
Hard enough to keep track of one baby.

392
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:31,537
I gotcha.

393
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:50,765
Captain, iceberg ahead.

394
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:58,189
Oh, no.

395
00:47:50,742 --> 00:47:53,744
Yeah! Who's up for round two?

396
00:47:57,291 --> 00:48:00,376
Tell the kid to be more careful.

397
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:42,460
Look. Tigers.

398
00:48:45,547 --> 00:48:50,384
It's OK. Look, the tigers are just
playing tag with the antelope.

399
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:56,891
- With their teeth.
- Come on, Sid. Let's play tag.

400
00:48:56,975 --> 00:48:59,060
You're it.

401
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:03,481
Sure. OK, OK, OK.
Where are the sloths?

402
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:06,651
You know, you never see any sloths.
Have you ever noticed?

403
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:10,196
- Look, Manny. A mammoth.
- Somebody pinch me.

404
00:49:10,238 --> 00:49:14,283
This fat one looks just like you.

405
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:16,577
And he's got a family.

406
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:20,081
And he's happy.
Look, he's playing with his kid.

407
00:49:20,165 --> 00:49:24,001
See, Manny? That's your problem.
That's what mammoths are supposed to do.

408
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:26,712
- Sid...
- Find a she-mmoth, have baby mammoths...

409
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:28,547
- Sid.
- What?

410
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:30,841
- Shut up.
- But...

411
00:52:58,133 --> 00:53:00,426
Well, would you look at that.

412
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:03,596
The tiger actually did it.
There's Half Peak.

413
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,390
Next stop, Glacier Pass.

414
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:10,519
- How could I ever have doubted you?
- Did you hear that, little fella?

415
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:12,980
You're almost home.

416
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:18,485
My feet are sweating.

417
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:21,822
Do we have to get a newsflash
every time your body does something?

418
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:26,702
- Just ignore him.
- Seriously. My feet are really hot.

419
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:34,752
Tell me that was your stomach.

420
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:37,046
I'm sure it was just thunder.

421
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:40,299
From underground?

422
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,488
Come on.
Keep up with me.

423
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:04,490
I would if you were moving.

424
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:10,913
- I wish I could jump like that.
- Wish granted.

425
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:19,922
- Come on, move faster.
- Have you noticed the river of lava?

426
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:40,526
Hold Pinky.

427
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:13,475
Manny!

428
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:31,243
Manny, Manny, you OK?
Say something. Anything.

429
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:35,414
What? I can't hear you.

430
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:37,916
You're standing on my trunk.

431
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:43,297
- You're OK.
- Why did you do that?

432
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:46,133
You could have died, trying to save me.

433
00:55:46,217 --> 00:55:51,388
That's what you do in a herd.
You look out for each other.

434
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:54,099
Well... thanks.

435
00:55:55,852 --> 00:56:00,606
I don't know about you guys,
but we are the weirdest herd I've ever seen.

436
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:22,086
I can't wait to get
my claws in that mammoth.

437
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:26,632
No one touches the mammoth
until I get that baby.

438
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:31,970
First, I'll slice its hind quarters into sections.

439
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:36,266
- I'll put the white meat in one pile and...
- Knock it off. I'm starving.

440
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:40,020
Next, the shoulders.
Occasionally tough, but extremely juicy.

441
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:43,315
- I told you to knock it off.
- Save your energy.

442
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:46,402
Mammoths don't go down easy.

443
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:48,987
There's only one way to do it.

444
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:51,698
First you have to force it into a corner.

445
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:56,328
Cut off its retreat.
And when you three have it trapped,

446
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:58,288
I'll go for the throat.

447
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:11,510
Guys, we gotta get this kid outta the wind.

448
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:18,016
- How much further?
- Three miles.

449
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:19,852
I'm beat.

450
00:57:19,894 --> 00:57:22,563
We'll get there in the morning.

451
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:28,360
- What are you doin'?
- I'm putting sloths on the map.

452
00:57:31,197 --> 00:57:34,158
Why don't you make it realistic
and draw him lying down?

453
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,535
And make him rounder.

454
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:42,875
- Perfect.
- Ha-ha... I forgot how to laugh.

455
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:52,551
I'm a genius.

456
00:57:55,513 --> 00:58:01,059
From now on you'll have to
refer to me as Sid, Lord of the Flame.

457
00:58:01,102 --> 00:58:04,688
Hey, Lord of the Flame.
Your tail's on fire.

458
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:16,658
Thank you. From now on,
I'm gonna call you Diego...

459
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:19,119
Lord of Touch Me and You're Dead.

460
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:22,664
I'm just kiddin', you little knucklehead.

461
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:25,042
Hey, lovebirds...

462
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:27,127
Look at this.

463
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:33,926
I don't believe it.

464
00:58:46,439 --> 00:58:51,610
Come here, you little biped.
Come here, you little wormy-worm.

465
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:54,780
Come to Uncle Sid.

466
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:57,032
This way. This way.

467
00:58:57,951 --> 00:58:59,785
No, no. Go to him.

468
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:02,955
Go to him.

469
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:07,793
OK...

470
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:13,131
Good job. Keep practisin'.

471
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:19,054
Look at that.
Our little guy is growing up.

472
00:59:21,474 --> 00:59:24,935
All right, come on.
Sleep time, lumpy.

473
00:59:29,857 --> 00:59:32,734
Look at that big pushover.

474
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:37,948
You know, Diego, I've never had
a friend who would risk his life for me.

475
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:42,661
Yeah, Manny's a good guy.

476
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:45,747
Yeah, he is.

477
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:48,750
Well, good night.

478
01:00:20,366 --> 01:00:25,912
Let's get you all cleaned up. What's your
daddy gonna say if you go back all stinky?

479
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:31,043
Let me just clean that up.
That looks good. A little bit here.

480
01:00:31,085 --> 01:00:34,713
- You clean up nice, little fella.
- I think he's starting to look like me.

481
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:37,299
Diego, what do you think?

482
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:41,053
- Maybe we shouldn't do this.
- Why not?

483
01:00:41,095 --> 01:00:44,890
If we save him, he'll grow up to be a hunter.
And who do you think he'll hunt?

484
01:00:44,932 --> 01:00:47,559
Maybe because we save him,
he won't hunt us.

485
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:52,189
And maybe he'll grow fur and
a long skinny neck and call you Mama.

486
01:00:52,732 --> 01:00:58,070
- What's your problem?
- Nothing. Let's go. I'm freezing my tail off.

487
01:01:17,465 --> 01:01:19,633
Hey, Diego.
You frozen back there?

488
01:01:23,888 --> 01:01:26,056
- Get down.
- What?

489
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:28,266
- Get down and follow me.
- What's goin' on?

490
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:33,355
At the bottom of Half Peak,
there's an ambush waiting for you.

491
01:01:33,439 --> 01:01:36,400
- What?
- What do you mean, ambush?

492
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:40,112
- You set us up.
- It was my job.

493
01:01:40,154 --> 01:01:43,782
- I was supposed to get the baby, but then...
- You brought us home for dinner.

494
01:01:43,825 --> 01:01:46,660
- That's it. You're out of the herd.
- I'm sorry.

495
01:01:46,744 --> 01:01:48,787
No, you're not. Not yet.

496
01:01:48,871 --> 01:01:52,666
- Listen, I can help you.
- Stay close, Sid. We can fight our way out.

497
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:56,002
You can't. The pack's too strong.
You have to trust me.

498
01:01:56,087 --> 01:01:58,797
Trust you?
Why in the world would we trust you?

499
01:01:59,507 --> 01:02:01,633
Because I'm your only chance.

500
01:02:15,189 --> 01:02:17,315
Hello, ladies.

501
01:02:18,109 --> 01:02:23,613
- Look who decided to show up.
- Diego, I was beginning to worry about you.

502
01:02:23,656 --> 01:02:29,953
No need to worry. In about two minutes
you'll be satisfying your taste for revenge.

503
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:31,788
Very nice.

504
01:02:31,831 --> 01:02:35,292
I see the sloth.
And he's got the baby!

505
01:02:35,334 --> 01:02:40,756
Don't give away your positions until you
see the mammoth. He's the one to surprise.

506
01:02:41,799 --> 01:02:44,426
You want to maul something, don't you?

507
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:48,513
- I wanna maul.
- Then what are you waiting for?

508
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:54,770
No! I said wait for the mammoth.

509
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:19,211
Backscratcher.
Eat my powder.

510
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:35,894
Loop-de-loop.

511
01:03:37,396 --> 01:03:39,773
Slalom! Slalom, baby.

512
01:04:05,424 --> 01:04:09,344
Sorry, fellas.
He got a little frostbite.

513
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:12,055
Get him!

514
01:04:15,977 --> 01:04:17,519
Surprise!

515
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:27,654
OK, follow me. We'll pick up Sid
and get outta here while we can.

516
01:04:27,738 --> 01:04:32,492
Come on, Diego.
Let's bring this mammoth down.

517
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:46,423
There he is.

518
01:04:48,426 --> 01:04:50,886
That's right.
Where's the baby?

519
01:04:54,765 --> 01:04:57,392
Survival of the fittest.

520
01:04:58,144 --> 01:05:01,313
I don't think so. Yeah...

521
01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:16,786
- What are you doing?
- Leave the mammoth alone.

522
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:22,751
Fine. I'll take you down first.

523
01:06:38,577 --> 01:06:40,745
We did it.

524
01:06:53,467 --> 01:06:56,136
We were some team, huh?

525
01:06:56,887 --> 01:07:00,348
Were? Come on, we're still a team.

526
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:03,393
I'm sorry I set you up.

527
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:06,730
You know me -
I'm too lazy to hold a grudge.

528
01:07:09,984 --> 01:07:12,861
Knock it off, squirt.

529
01:07:12,945 --> 01:07:15,113
You gotta be strong.

530
01:07:15,156 --> 01:07:18,783
You have to take care of Manfred and Sid.

531
01:07:19,744 --> 01:07:21,578
Especially Sid.

532
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:25,749
Come on, you can lick this.
You're a tiger.

533
01:07:25,791 --> 01:07:28,418
Look, I'll carry you.
What do you say?

534
01:07:28,794 --> 01:07:31,337
Come on, Diego.

535
01:07:31,422 --> 01:07:33,631
Tell him he's going to be OK, Manny.

536
01:07:35,134 --> 01:07:38,803
Listen, you have to leave me here.

537
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:43,099
If those humans get through the pass,
you'll never catch them.

538
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:46,811
You didn't have to do that.

539
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:49,689
That's what you do in a herd.

540
01:11:05,386 --> 01:11:09,180
Don't forget about us. OK?

541
01:11:11,892 --> 01:11:15,061
We won't forget about you.

542
01:11:54,268 --> 01:11:55,768
Bye.

543
01:11:56,979 --> 01:11:58,438
Goodbye.

544
01:11:58,522 --> 01:12:00,565
- Goodbye.
- Sid...

545
01:12:00,607 --> 01:12:04,152
Bye. Bye...

546
01:12:08,073 --> 01:12:10,533
That's right. Where's the baby?

547
01:12:10,576 --> 01:12:13,578
Come on, Sid.
Let's head south.

548
01:12:31,096 --> 01:12:33,181
Bye.

549
01:12:34,308 --> 01:12:37,852
Save your breath, Sid.
You know humans can't talk.

550
01:12:38,270 --> 01:12:40,355
Diego? You're OK.

551
01:12:40,439 --> 01:12:41,856
Nine lives, baby.

552
01:12:42,816 --> 01:12:44,817
You're OK.

553
01:12:46,278 --> 01:12:48,613
I could kiss ya.

554
01:12:48,697 --> 01:12:50,365
Yuck!

555
01:12:50,449 --> 01:12:52,617
Welcome back, partner.
Wanna lift?

556
01:12:52,659 --> 01:12:55,620
No thanks. I gotta save
whatever dignity I've got left.

557
01:12:55,704 --> 01:12:59,374
You're hanging out with us.
Dignity's got nothing to do with it.

558
01:12:59,458 --> 01:13:02,919
- But I'll take that lift.
- Climb aboard.

559
01:13:02,961 --> 01:13:07,632
Yee-ha, mush.
Or not mush. Either way.

560
01:13:10,594 --> 01:13:13,304
This is gonna be the best migration ever.

561
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:18,309
I'll show you all my favourite watering holes.
I turn brown when the fungus in my fur dries.

562
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:22,230
- Sounds very attractive.
- This whole ice age thing is getting old.

563
01:13:22,314 --> 01:13:25,650
You know what I could go for?
Global warming.
