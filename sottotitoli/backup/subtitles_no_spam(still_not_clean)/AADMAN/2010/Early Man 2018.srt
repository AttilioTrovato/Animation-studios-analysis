1
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:11,870

2
00:01:47,481 --> 00:01:49,951
Huh? Oh!

3
00:02:04,297 --> 00:02:05,400
Ooh!

4
00:04:39,219 --> 00:04:40,751
Nearly there, Hognob.

5
00:04:40,753 --> 00:04:43,557
Nearly there.
Just a bit farther.

6
00:04:45,191 --> 00:04:46,693
Try a little bit harder.

7
00:04:48,462 --> 00:04:49,597
We can do it.

8
00:04:51,664 --> 00:04:53,465
Just a little bit more, Hognob.

9
00:04:56,604 --> 00:04:58,573
I can reach it.

10
00:05:04,577 --> 00:05:05,580
Got it.

11
00:05:07,748 --> 00:05:10,418
Still got it.

12
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:22,861
Hognob, enough!

13
00:05:22,863 --> 00:05:24,565
Oi, enough now!

14
00:05:28,801 --> 00:05:32,373
Mammoths! Come on, Hognob.
Let's go wake Bobnar.

15
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:34,109
Hey, Chief.

16
00:05:39,746 --> 00:05:40,747
Chief!

17
00:05:41,714 --> 00:05:43,282
What? What? What?

18
00:05:44,551 --> 00:05:46,220
Are you awake, Chief?

19
00:05:48,289 --> 00:05:49,955
Chief?

20
00:05:49,957 --> 00:05:51,556
Time to go hunting.

21
00:05:51,558 --> 00:05:53,357
Bit early, isn't it, Dug?

22
00:05:53,359 --> 00:05:55,960
But, Chief, we're early man.

23
00:05:59,299 --> 00:06:00,832
Come on, everyone.

24
00:06:00,834 --> 00:06:02,137
Time to get up.

25
00:06:18,284 --> 00:06:19,751
Morning, everyone.

26
00:06:19,753 --> 00:06:22,821
Morning, Chief.

27
00:06:22,823 --> 00:06:24,823
Bit nippy this morning.

28
00:06:24,825 --> 00:06:25,926
Ow! Ow!

29
00:06:27,294 --> 00:06:28,460
Ow!

30
00:06:29,796 --> 00:06:30,797
Oops. Sorry.

31
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:34,936
Wait, Chief. Chief...

32
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,669
Chief.

33
00:06:38,671 --> 00:06:40,272
So I've been thinking.

34
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:42,241
You know we always hunt rabbits?

35
00:06:42,243 --> 00:06:45,344
Yeah. Very tasty they are, too.

36
00:06:45,346 --> 00:06:48,679
Yes, but couldn't we
try hunting something,

37
00:06:48,681 --> 00:06:51,583
well, you know, bigger?

38
00:06:51,585 --> 00:06:53,818
What, like a hare?

39
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,621
No, like a buffalo or a mammoth.

40
00:06:59,592 --> 00:07:05,364
You want us to hunt a
five-ton, bone-crushing mammoth?

41
00:07:05,366 --> 00:07:06,967
Yeah. Why not?

42
00:07:08,601 --> 00:07:11,302
I really believe
we could do it, Chief.

43
00:07:11,304 --> 00:07:14,438
Dug, look at our ancestors.

44
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,676
You don't see them
hunting big things, do you?

45
00:07:17,678 --> 00:07:19,981
They hunted little round beasts.

46
00:07:21,481 --> 00:07:23,515
Of some sort.

47
00:07:23,517 --> 00:07:26,417
Yeah, what are
those things anyway?

48
00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:27,518
Don't know.

49
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,756
I suppose they couldn't
draw rabbits back then.

50
00:07:38,998 --> 00:07:40,599
Wait. Sorry, no, Chief.

51
00:07:40,601 --> 00:07:42,400
Chief,

52
00:07:42,402 --> 00:07:43,768
about the mammoth thing...

53
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:47,574
Look, I'll tell you what, I'll
definitely bear it in mind.

54
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:49,410
All right?

55
00:07:50,743 --> 00:07:52,611
Come on, Dug.

56
00:07:52,613 --> 00:07:55,315
Right, gather round.

57
00:07:56,383 --> 00:07:57,484
Grab a spear.

58
00:07:58,618 --> 00:08:00,551
Oh! It's pointy!

59
00:08:00,553 --> 00:08:04,388
- Oh, Treebor. Just get over there.
- Aw, Mum!

60
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,023
- Morning, Barry.
- Morning, Dug.

61
00:08:06,025 --> 00:08:08,025
Mr. Rock coming hunting today?

62
00:08:08,027 --> 00:08:10,729
Oh, yeah, wouldn't miss it
for the world.

63
00:08:10,731 --> 00:08:13,364
Morning, Asbo.
Change your underpants today?

64
00:08:13,366 --> 00:08:15,366
Yeah! Changed them
with Thongo, Chief.

65
00:08:15,368 --> 00:08:16,434
Champion!

66
00:08:16,436 --> 00:08:17,568
Mmm.

67
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:20,071
- Chief.
- Yes, Gravelle?

68
00:08:20,073 --> 00:08:22,943
When I put my arm up, it hurts.

69
00:08:23,811 --> 00:08:25,710
Well, don't do it, then.

70
00:08:25,712 --> 00:08:28,549
Grubup, don't eat that.
That's Eemak.

71
00:08:29,015 --> 00:08:30,549
Yum!

72
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,955
Exactly. Uh... Right.

73
00:08:36,957 --> 00:08:38,458
Heads down, everyone.

74
00:08:39,092 --> 00:08:40,395
Thank you, Dug.

75
00:08:41,962 --> 00:08:43,497
Shh!

76
00:08:46,667 --> 00:08:50,101
We give thanks for our valley,
our home,

77
00:08:50,103 --> 00:08:53,003
this precious ground,
which sustains us

78
00:08:53,005 --> 00:08:56,907
and gives us shelter
from the Badlands.

79
00:08:56,909 --> 00:09:01,812
May we live in peace, balance,
and harmony with our forest

80
00:09:01,814 --> 00:09:04,685
and all the creatures
we share it with.

81
00:09:07,621 --> 00:09:09,620
Right, let's go kill something.

82
00:10:02,809 --> 00:10:03,810
A rabbit!

83
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:10,385
That's it. That's it.

84
00:10:13,153 --> 00:10:15,586
I've got him.

85
00:10:15,588 --> 00:10:16,957
To you, Eemak.

86
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,191
Ouch.

87
00:10:24,465 --> 00:10:25,696
Nice try, though.

88
00:10:25,698 --> 00:10:28,099
Let's use
an element of surprise.

89
00:10:29,937 --> 00:10:31,636
Righto, Chief.

90
00:10:31,638 --> 00:10:32,737
Ow!

91
00:10:32,739 --> 00:10:33,775
I got him!

92
00:10:36,643 --> 00:10:37,776
No, I haven't!

93
00:10:37,778 --> 00:10:40,512
Great! Champion!

94
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,816
Got you!

95
00:10:45,818 --> 00:10:46,951
Whoa!

96
00:10:46,953 --> 00:10:48,188
I got this, Gravelle.

97
00:10:50,624 --> 00:10:51,989
Ha-hey!

98
00:11:05,505 --> 00:11:07,571
Well done, Mr. Rock!

99
00:11:09,275 --> 00:11:11,276
Nice job, everyone.

100
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:13,581
Rabbit surprise tonight!

101
00:11:28,194 --> 00:11:29,894
See, Dug?

102
00:11:29,896 --> 00:11:32,964
We hunt rabbits,
everyone's happy.

103
00:11:34,768 --> 00:11:36,902
Although the thing
about rabbits, Chief,

104
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:38,936
well, they are quite small.

105
00:11:38,938 --> 00:11:41,675
Dug, Dug. Look at us...

106
00:11:42,976 --> 00:11:46,644
You seriously think
we could catch a mammoth?

107
00:11:46,646 --> 00:11:48,279
Nice moves, Mr. Rock.

108
00:11:48,281 --> 00:11:49,516
Us lot?

109
00:11:50,717 --> 00:11:52,019
You've been practicing.

110
00:12:05,665 --> 00:12:07,699
Shush, everyone.

111
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:49,742
The rabbits are fighting back!

112
00:12:51,345 --> 00:12:53,281
I don't think this is rabbits.

113
00:12:55,015 --> 00:12:56,250
Attack!

114
00:13:10,163 --> 00:13:11,966
Run!

115
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,252
Mr. Rock!

116
00:13:34,053 --> 00:13:35,820
No!

117
00:13:35,822 --> 00:13:38,025
No!

118
00:13:38,991 --> 00:13:40,892
To the Badlands!

119
00:13:40,894 --> 00:13:42,826
What, leave the valley?

120
00:13:42,828 --> 00:13:44,364
Come on. Just run.

121
00:13:46,699 --> 00:13:47,701
Hognob!

122
00:13:56,742 --> 00:13:58,109
Where's Dug?

123
00:13:58,111 --> 00:13:59,279
Have you seen Dug?

124
00:14:03,216 --> 00:14:05,050
- Go on.
- Thank you, Chief.

125
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,289
Dug!

126
00:14:47,861 --> 00:14:49,263
Hmm...

127
00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:51,431
Excellent.

128
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,303
All right, secure the valley.

129
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:59,973
Start mining ore.

130
00:15:01,107 --> 00:15:02,443
Or what, Lord Nooth?

131
00:15:05,312 --> 00:15:09,480
Ore, you fool!
Start mining the ore.

132
00:15:09,482 --> 00:15:11,452
The metal that's in the ground.

133
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:16,019
Oh, the ore! In the ground.

134
00:15:16,021 --> 00:15:16,922
Yes.

135
00:15:20,994 --> 00:15:22,229
What about the primitives?

136
00:15:23,163 --> 00:15:25,296
Oh, let them rot
in The Badlands.

137
00:15:25,298 --> 00:15:27,031
They are
the low-achievers of history

138
00:15:27,033 --> 00:15:28,465
with their puny flints
and their drafty caves.

139
00:15:28,467 --> 00:15:31,002
You've picked the wrong
tribe to mess with.

140
00:15:31,004 --> 00:15:33,370
Oh, I am so scared!
You are waving your stones about!

141
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:37,041
The Age of Stone is over, Dino.

142
00:15:38,178 --> 00:15:41,178
Long live the Age of Bronze!

143
00:15:46,452 --> 00:15:48,488
Oh.

144
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,796
Okay, let's get moving.

145
00:15:57,798 --> 00:15:59,497
Of course, Lord Nooth.

146
00:15:59,499 --> 00:16:01,168
I'm late for my massage.

147
00:16:40,073 --> 00:16:41,542
Huh?

148
00:16:56,856 --> 00:16:57,857
Uh...

149
00:17:22,282 --> 00:17:24,284
What are you doing?
Get out of the way!

150
00:17:24,985 --> 00:17:26,086
Hey! Hey!

151
00:17:36,929 --> 00:17:39,033
Multi-purpose pen swords!

152
00:17:40,266 --> 00:17:42,902
Very handy
for opening bottles, too!

153
00:17:43,436 --> 00:17:45,336
Sliced bread. Wow!

154
00:17:45,338 --> 00:17:48,606
That's the best thing since...
Well, ever!

155
00:17:48,608 --> 00:17:49,944
Oh!

156
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,882
Hmm.

157
00:17:57,217 --> 00:17:58,582
Hey!

158
00:17:58,584 --> 00:18:01,551
- Huh?
- Don't touch the bronze.

159
00:18:01,553 --> 00:18:03,353
- The what?
- The bronze!

160
00:18:03,355 --> 00:18:05,358
Where have you been,
the Stone Age?

161
00:18:05,926 --> 00:18:07,461
Oh. Uh...

162
00:18:08,428 --> 00:18:09,496
What?

163
00:18:34,219 --> 00:18:37,455
Fifty schnookels!
Fifty schnookels!

164
00:18:37,457 --> 00:18:41,158
Voluntary contribution.
Everyone has to pay!

165
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,293
It's gone up again.

166
00:18:42,295 --> 00:18:44,594
- It's daylight robbery!
- Fifty schnookels!

167
00:18:44,596 --> 00:18:46,330
Voluntary contribution!

168
00:18:46,332 --> 00:18:49,099
Hey! She hasn't
voluntarily contributed.

169
00:18:49,101 --> 00:18:51,135
Hmm? Stop her!

170
00:18:52,706 --> 00:18:55,509
- Hey. Hey.
- Oi! Stop her!

171
00:19:16,996 --> 00:19:18,631
Whoa!

172
00:19:26,105 --> 00:19:27,472
Hmm?

173
00:19:27,474 --> 00:19:31,109
Hello. Oh!

174
00:19:36,716 --> 00:19:38,519
Sorry!

175
00:19:44,623 --> 00:19:45,622
I tell you,

176
00:19:45,624 --> 00:19:48,126
I wouldn't want to
be facing me out there.

177
00:19:54,199 --> 00:19:58,269
Hey, Hügelgraber,
can't you see in that thing?

178
00:19:58,271 --> 00:20:00,007
The arena's this way.

179
00:20:04,677 --> 00:20:08,612
You girls are gonna
get slaughtered.

180
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:12,149
Let's go!

181
00:20:30,503 --> 00:20:36,407
<i>All stand for our mighty
leader, Lord Nooth!</i>

182
00:20:38,678 --> 00:20:42,713
<i>Who challenges the champions?</i>

183
00:20:42,715 --> 00:20:45,649
We challenge the champions!

184
00:20:45,651 --> 00:20:48,186
We accept the challenge!

185
00:20:50,823 --> 00:20:53,190
<i>The hour has come.</i>

186
00:20:55,861 --> 00:20:59,198
<i>Let the sacred game commence!</i>

187
00:21:09,876 --> 00:21:13,811
<i>Introducing Real Bronzio</i>

188
00:21:13,813 --> 00:21:17,247
<i>and the captain, Jurgend!</i>

189
00:21:17,249 --> 00:21:22,153
<i>Today's match official,
Referee Dino!</i>

190
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:25,255
<i>In the name
of Queen Oofeefa,</i>

191
00:21:25,257 --> 00:21:28,629
<i>we give thanks
for the beautiful game.</i>

192
00:21:29,862 --> 00:21:32,330
<i>Oggy! Oggy! Oggy!</i>

193
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:34,232
Oi! Oi! Oi!

194
00:21:34,234 --> 00:21:36,868
<i>Let's play football!</i>

195
00:21:39,706 --> 00:21:42,509
Whilst I count my schnookels.

196
00:21:55,889 --> 00:21:58,421
Hügelgraber!
What are you doing?

197
00:21:58,423 --> 00:21:59,790
Get in the goal!

198
00:21:59,792 --> 00:22:03,330
What's up with Hügelgraber?
Come on!

199
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:10,670
Pick it up! Pick it up!

200
00:22:11,504 --> 00:22:13,140
To me! To me!

201
00:22:14,474 --> 00:22:16,706
What? Put it down!

202
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:17,777
Put it down!

203
00:22:20,647 --> 00:22:21,448
Free kick!

204
00:22:24,883 --> 00:22:27,787
Hügelgraber!
Just get in the game!

205
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:52,877
Just kick it!

206
00:23:03,855 --> 00:23:05,458
Huh?

207
00:23:12,899 --> 00:23:13,900
Huh?

208
00:23:15,735 --> 00:23:17,834
What are you doing,
Hügelgraber?

209
00:23:17,836 --> 00:23:19,803
You just scored an own goal!

210
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,840
He's not me!

211
00:23:23,842 --> 00:23:25,946
Huh?

212
00:23:30,416 --> 00:23:31,749
Oh!

213
00:23:31,751 --> 00:23:33,453
Huh?

214
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:35,619
A caveman?

215
00:23:35,621 --> 00:23:39,256
- A caveman?
- A caveman?

216
00:23:39,258 --> 00:23:42,261
Playing the sacred game?
Bring him here.

217
00:23:44,764 --> 00:23:46,563
How dare you...

218
00:23:46,565 --> 00:23:49,266
Oh.

219
00:23:49,268 --> 00:23:52,872
How dare you set foot
on our hallowed ground?

220
00:23:56,042 --> 00:23:58,876
You took our ground.

221
00:23:58,878 --> 00:24:01,811
- Our home!
- Oh, that.

222
00:24:01,813 --> 00:24:03,747
Listen, you Stone Age brute.

223
00:24:03,749 --> 00:24:06,449
You have no home.

224
00:24:06,451 --> 00:24:09,288
Your kind are finished
on this Earth.

225
00:24:10,055 --> 00:24:11,691
Now take him away and kill him.

226
00:24:12,391 --> 00:24:13,392
Slowly.

227
00:24:17,796 --> 00:24:21,532
Argh! No, I mean
take him away at normal speed

228
00:24:21,534 --> 00:24:23,868
and kill him slowly. Idiots!

229
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:25,671
Now get on with the game.

230
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:31,574
<i>We challenge the champions!</i>

231
00:24:31,576 --> 00:24:33,380
Wait... Wait!

232
00:24:46,391 --> 00:24:49,392
We challenge the champions!

233
00:24:49,394 --> 00:24:50,630
Huh?

234
00:24:51,331 --> 00:24:53,863
What did you say?

235
00:24:53,865 --> 00:24:56,936
- He said, "We challenge..."
- I heard what he said!

236
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:01,371
If we win, we keep our valley.

237
00:25:01,373 --> 00:25:03,742
You leave my tribe in peace.

238
00:25:04,774 --> 00:25:05,642
Hmm.

239
00:25:05,644 --> 00:25:10,650
You think you can beat us
at football?

240
00:25:19,592 --> 00:25:23,330
A match between
the Bronze and the brutes?

241
00:25:23,862 --> 00:25:25,529
What an idea!

242
00:25:25,531 --> 00:25:28,532
Sacrilege, O Premier Leader!

243
00:25:28,534 --> 00:25:29,800
Yes. Quite.

244
00:25:29,802 --> 00:25:34,041
The masses would flock to see
such a vulgar spectacle. Pah!

245
00:25:34,607 --> 00:25:35,609
Hmm...

246
00:25:37,774 --> 00:25:37,910
Oh!

247
00:25:38,777 --> 00:25:39,912
Really?

248
00:25:40,979 --> 00:25:43,683
For the valley, you say?

249
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:03,437
Hmm?

250
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:13,711
- Dug!
- It's Dug!

251
00:26:13,713 --> 00:26:15,482
He's alive!

252
00:26:17,749 --> 00:26:21,354
Uh, what's that crazy fruit
he's got?

253
00:26:22,854 --> 00:26:24,522
"Football"?

254
00:26:24,524 --> 00:26:26,590
What's "football"?

255
00:26:26,592 --> 00:26:28,492
And how's it going to get
our valley back?

256
00:26:28,494 --> 00:26:31,829
Well, it's this amazing game,
Chief.

257
00:26:31,831 --> 00:26:33,496
And the leader
of the Bronze people,

258
00:26:33,498 --> 00:26:36,567
he says if we play this game
and beat them at it...

259
00:26:36,569 --> 00:26:38,436
Ooh, nice tight shorts!

260
00:26:38,438 --> 00:26:39,602
Aw, Mum!

261
00:26:39,604 --> 00:26:41,605
...we can have our valley back.

262
00:26:41,607 --> 00:26:43,640
That's what we want.

263
00:26:43,642 --> 00:26:46,142
- And if we don't beat them?
- Ah.

264
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:47,311
Well, then,

265
00:26:47,313 --> 00:26:50,648
he said we'll spend the rest
of our miserable lives

266
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,049
working down a mine.

267
00:26:52,051 --> 00:26:55,489
No!

268
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:58,525
- What's a "mine"?
- Dug,

269
00:26:59,592 --> 00:27:02,025
we've never even played
this game.

270
00:27:02,027 --> 00:27:03,162
But that's just it.

271
00:27:04,063 --> 00:27:06,062
We did. Once.

272
00:27:06,064 --> 00:27:06,997
Huh?

273
00:27:06,999 --> 00:27:10,167
Those cave paintings
back in our valley,

274
00:27:10,169 --> 00:27:14,671
they're pictures of our
ancestors playing football.

275
00:27:22,982 --> 00:27:25,519
- Champion!
- So if they did it,

276
00:27:26,486 --> 00:27:28,051
surely we can do it.

277
00:27:30,622 --> 00:27:33,724
Sorry! Shimmering memories
make me sneeze.

278
00:27:33,726 --> 00:27:36,159
This doesn't change anything,
Dug.

279
00:27:36,161 --> 00:27:37,761
It's just too risky.

280
00:27:37,763 --> 00:27:40,263
Oh, come on, Chief!
We can do it, Chief!

281
00:27:40,265 --> 00:27:42,936
I wanna play football!
I wanna play now!

282
00:27:43,268 --> 00:27:45,168
Now!

283
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:48,073
Listen...
No, we're not... No!

284
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:54,043
All right, then.
Don't worry about us.

285
00:27:54,045 --> 00:27:56,513
Yeah, we'll...
We'll be okay.

286
00:27:56,515 --> 00:27:59,119
We'll just die a slow and
lingering death in the Badlands.

287
00:27:59,584 --> 00:28:00,586
Huh?

288
00:28:01,086 --> 00:28:02,887
Come on, Chief.

289
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:05,891
Just give us a chance. Please!

290
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:13,129
Look, all right.

291
00:28:14,699 --> 00:28:17,901
Maybe we'll give this
"football" idea a try, then.

292
00:28:23,074 --> 00:28:24,308
No promises, mind.

293
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:26,944
The match is to be played
at the full moon.

294
00:28:28,648 --> 00:28:31,782
And then we go back
to the valley!

295
00:28:31,784 --> 00:28:34,851
Sweet!

296
00:28:53,305 --> 00:28:55,839
Right, line up,
everybody! In line!

297
00:28:55,841 --> 00:28:58,242
- All yours, Dug.
- Thanks, Chief.

298
00:28:58,244 --> 00:28:59,579
All right!

299
00:29:00,246 --> 00:29:02,946
- Um...
- Um...

300
00:29:02,948 --> 00:29:05,282
Are hogs supposed
to play football?

301
00:29:05,284 --> 00:29:07,083
No. Oh...

302
00:29:07,085 --> 00:29:09,753
Probably not, no.
Sorry, Hognob.

303
00:29:13,892 --> 00:29:17,061
This is a football.

304
00:29:17,063 --> 00:29:21,331
One side tries to kick
the ball into this goal.

305
00:29:21,333 --> 00:29:23,333
Ooh.

306
00:29:23,335 --> 00:29:27,605
And the other side tries
to kick the ball in that goal.

307
00:29:27,607 --> 00:29:28,608
Ahh!

308
00:29:29,207 --> 00:29:31,140
Football sounds hard.

309
00:29:31,142 --> 00:29:33,910
What happens if you kick
the ball in the goal?

310
00:29:33,912 --> 00:29:36,080
Well, if you kick the ball
in the goal,

311
00:29:36,082 --> 00:29:38,017
then other men hug and kiss you.

312
00:29:39,651 --> 00:29:41,118
- Oh.
- Mmm.

313
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,719
Right, who wants to try?

314
00:29:42,721 --> 00:29:43,920
I'll give it a go.

315
00:29:43,922 --> 00:29:45,254
- Nice one.
- Aw, Mum!

316
00:29:45,256 --> 00:29:49,859
Good, Magma. All right, okay, good.
Right. Um...

317
00:29:49,861 --> 00:29:52,696
So I'm...
I'm gonna try and get the ball,

318
00:29:52,698 --> 00:29:54,967
and you have to stop me, okay?

319
00:29:58,103 --> 00:29:59,802
Come on, come on!

320
00:29:59,804 --> 00:30:02,939
Ow!

321
00:30:02,941 --> 00:30:05,376
- Nice one, Mum!
- Football's brilliant.

322
00:30:05,378 --> 00:30:07,744
That can't be right.

323
00:30:07,746 --> 00:30:10,714
Surely, you can't hit
other players?

324
00:30:10,716 --> 00:30:13,216
No, you're supposed
to attack the ball.

325
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:18,187
No, no, no, no, not weapons!

326
00:30:18,189 --> 00:30:19,255
Just use fist?

327
00:30:19,257 --> 00:30:21,992
No! No fighting at all.

328
00:30:21,994 --> 00:30:23,929
- Where's the fun in that?
- Uh...

329
00:30:24,729 --> 00:30:26,397
Hmm.

330
00:30:38,343 --> 00:30:40,380
Okay, Thongo!

331
00:30:41,046 --> 00:30:42,913
Oh!

332
00:30:42,915 --> 00:30:44,317
Ooh!

333
00:30:45,884 --> 00:30:47,317
- Oh!
- Yes!

334
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:50,290
Good effort. Great.
Okay, next.

335
00:30:51,957 --> 00:30:53,290
Huh?

336
00:30:53,292 --> 00:30:54,394
Hognob.

337
00:30:58,363 --> 00:30:59,929
Go for it, Asbo.

338
00:31:02,868 --> 00:31:04,303
Yay!

339
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:07,207
Yay!

340
00:31:11,976 --> 00:31:13,377
Oh...

341
00:31:20,986 --> 00:31:22,919
Excuse me!

342
00:31:22,921 --> 00:31:24,923
Can we have our ball back,
please?

343
00:31:27,726 --> 00:31:28,861
Huh. Hmm.

344
00:31:31,863 --> 00:31:34,898
Trust me, Dino.
This football match between

345
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,966
the Stone Age
and the Bronze World,

346
00:31:36,968 --> 00:31:39,203
it's perfect!

347
00:31:39,205 --> 00:31:42,442
- Oh, how I love it!
- Yes, football.

348
00:31:43,374 --> 00:31:44,443
No.

349
00:31:44,976 --> 00:31:47,010
Bronze!

350
00:31:47,012 --> 00:31:49,812
Mmm.

351
00:31:49,814 --> 00:31:52,849
So cold and hard and slippery.

352
00:31:52,851 --> 00:31:54,451
Mmm.

353
00:31:54,453 --> 00:31:56,253
Ooh.

354
00:31:56,255 --> 00:31:59,822
And this game is going
to make me loads of it.

355
00:31:59,824 --> 00:32:03,127
Your Premiership,
what if the Queen finds out?

356
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:05,395
That old crow?

357
00:32:05,397 --> 00:32:07,464
She doesn't know
what goes on out here.

358
00:32:07,466 --> 00:32:08,831
Luckily.

359
00:32:13,005 --> 00:32:14,471
Delivering message!

360
00:32:14,473 --> 00:32:17,010
Your Footballness,
it's a Message Bird.

361
00:32:17,509 --> 00:32:18,711
Huh?

362
00:32:21,781 --> 00:32:23,950
Ugh. Well, go on, make it...

363
00:32:29,854 --> 00:32:31,423
"Hello? Hello?

364
00:32:32,824 --> 00:32:34,925
"How do you use
this Message Bird thing?"

365
00:32:34,927 --> 00:32:36,028
It's the Queen.

366
00:32:38,363 --> 00:32:40,296
"Just
speak into its ear, ma'am.

367
00:32:40,298 --> 00:32:43,833
"It will mimic
everything it hears."

368
00:32:43,835 --> 00:32:47,303
"I don't even know if
I'm holding it the... Testing!

369
00:32:47,305 --> 00:32:48,871
"Testing!

370
00:32:48,873 --> 00:32:50,407
"Nooth? Nooth?"

371
00:32:50,409 --> 00:32:52,943
Perhaps she's heard
about the game.

372
00:32:52,945 --> 00:32:55,344
Of course she hasn't
heard about the game.

373
00:32:55,346 --> 00:32:57,380
"I've heard about the game.

374
00:32:57,382 --> 00:33:02,054
- "You, arranging a football
match against a bunch of savages?

375
00:33:02,521 --> 00:33:04,288
"You idiot!

376
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:06,189
"Imagine if we lost."

377
00:33:06,191 --> 00:33:08,527
- We won't.
- "I said, imagine it!

378
00:33:09,294 --> 00:33:10,828
"Exactly!

379
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:12,995
"The mighty Bronze Age

380
00:33:12,997 --> 00:33:16,399
"brought to its knees
by a bunch of cavemen?

381
00:33:16,401 --> 00:33:19,069
"Well, I'm warning you, Nooth.

382
00:33:19,071 --> 00:33:21,374
"You'd better not lose."

383
00:33:22,173 --> 00:33:24,107
"Hmm?"

384
00:33:25,343 --> 00:33:26,779
End of message.

385
00:33:29,547 --> 00:33:30,949
Oh! Hmm.

386
00:33:32,618 --> 00:33:34,484
Silly old bat!

387
00:33:34,486 --> 00:33:37,186
How dare she talk
to me like that!

388
00:33:37,188 --> 00:33:39,956
"Silly old bat!

389
00:33:39,958 --> 00:33:43,226
"How dare she talk
to me like that?"

390
00:33:43,228 --> 00:33:44,628
Delivering message!

391
00:33:48,033 --> 00:33:51,534
Guards! Get that bird back!

392
00:33:51,536 --> 00:33:54,237
What does the Queen know anyway?

393
00:33:54,239 --> 00:33:57,206
The cavemen are oafs.
My players are...

394
00:33:57,208 --> 00:33:58,277
Overpaid?

395
00:33:58,643 --> 00:33:59,945
Champions!

396
00:34:00,946 --> 00:34:03,080
Oh, yes, champions.

397
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:08,084
They spend their days thinking,
sleeping, eating football.

398
00:34:08,086 --> 00:34:11,190
<i>And I hardly think
the cavemen will be doing that.</i>

399
00:34:12,624 --> 00:34:14,157
Rise and shine!

400
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,492
Training time!

401
00:34:24,936 --> 00:34:26,271
Ow!

402
00:34:27,439 --> 00:34:30,606
No, not like that.

403
00:34:31,577 --> 00:34:34,881
When I said "free kick,"
I meant of the ball.

404
00:34:35,347 --> 00:34:37,079
Sorry, Dug.

405
00:34:37,081 --> 00:34:39,216
Hognob, no!

406
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:45,454
Barry, where are you going?
No, don't wander off!

407
00:34:45,456 --> 00:34:47,189
Football's hard.

408
00:34:47,191 --> 00:34:49,959
Dug, my toe hurts!

409
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:56,302
Grubup, drop it!
I told you,

410
00:34:57,568 --> 00:35:00,273
it's the only one we've got.

411
00:35:01,139 --> 00:35:02,472
Come on, everyone!

412
00:35:02,474 --> 00:35:05,943
We should be able to do this.
No, don't... Don't sit down.

413
00:35:05,945 --> 00:35:07,914
Grubup no like football.

414
00:35:08,579 --> 00:35:10,981
Make Grubup hungry.

415
00:35:14,619 --> 00:35:16,288
Oh. Oh, ho-ho.

416
00:35:17,423 --> 00:35:20,159
Food. Yum!

417
00:35:30,202 --> 00:35:31,236
Huh?

418
00:35:39,544 --> 00:35:41,378
Oh...

419
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:48,517
Duck! Duck!

420
00:35:48,519 --> 00:35:49,720
Huh?

421
00:35:49,722 --> 00:35:51,990
No! Duck!

422
00:35:54,059 --> 00:35:57,063
Look!
It's a giant man-eating mallard!

423
00:35:57,997 --> 00:35:59,065
Run away!

424
00:36:03,401 --> 00:36:04,700
Huh?

425
00:36:38,736 --> 00:36:41,273
You haven't eaten
your primordial soup.

426
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,176
Not really hungry.

427
00:36:44,675 --> 00:36:46,078
Oh...

428
00:36:46,611 --> 00:36:47,747
Huh?

429
00:36:56,387 --> 00:36:59,622
Dug, it's time to give up
this football lark

430
00:36:59,624 --> 00:37:01,457
for their sake.

431
00:37:01,459 --> 00:37:03,396
They're just not capable of it.

432
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,629
Don't you miss the valley,
Chief?

433
00:37:06,631 --> 00:37:09,332
The valley's gone now.

434
00:37:09,334 --> 00:37:11,568
And we're better off
here in the Badlands

435
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:13,303
than slaving down some mine.

436
00:37:13,305 --> 00:37:15,571
I mean, there's
the odd giant duck around,

437
00:37:15,573 --> 00:37:17,744
but at least
we're still together.

438
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:19,843
We're still a tribe.

439
00:37:19,845 --> 00:37:22,111
But our ancestors
played football.

440
00:37:22,113 --> 00:37:24,146
We know they did.

441
00:37:24,148 --> 00:37:26,483
I still believe we can do this.

442
00:37:26,485 --> 00:37:28,517
With what?

443
00:37:28,519 --> 00:37:31,356
You haven't even got
a ball to play with.

444
00:37:37,229 --> 00:37:38,364
It's over.

445
00:37:45,871 --> 00:37:48,340
No. There's still time.

446
00:37:49,374 --> 00:37:50,543
Come on, Hognob.

447
00:38:10,461 --> 00:38:12,662
Okay, Hognob. Hognob?

448
00:38:12,664 --> 00:38:13,800
Huh?

449
00:38:25,543 --> 00:38:27,144
Right.

450
00:38:27,146 --> 00:38:28,514
Let's go get some balls.

451
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:36,355
Shh!

452
00:38:36,921 --> 00:38:38,157
Shh!

453
00:38:53,171 --> 00:38:54,639
Ow!

454
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:01,244
What strange magic is this?

455
00:39:07,285 --> 00:39:09,419
Hognob. You stay.

456
00:39:09,421 --> 00:39:10,756
I don't want
to attract attention.

457
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:14,393
Huh?

458
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,794
What's all that
crashing around out there?

459
00:39:53,298 --> 00:39:54,664
Is that you, Stefano?

460
00:39:54,666 --> 00:39:56,265
Huh?

461
00:39:56,267 --> 00:39:58,434
Stop messing about
and get in here

462
00:39:58,436 --> 00:40:00,906
with those firm hands of yours.

463
00:40:03,342 --> 00:40:04,376
Uh...

464
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:08,745
Come on, Stefano!

465
00:40:08,747 --> 00:40:10,883
It's time for my massage.

466
00:40:28,267 --> 00:40:29,733
And the exciting
new signing

467
00:40:29,735 --> 00:40:31,903
picks the ball up
in the center circle.

468
00:40:33,338 --> 00:40:34,807
She beats one,

469
00:40:35,573 --> 00:40:36,905
nutmegs another,

470
00:40:36,907 --> 00:40:39,742
lobs it neatly over
the big fullback.

471
00:40:39,744 --> 00:40:41,577
She's going all the way.

472
00:40:41,579 --> 00:40:42,614
She shoots!

473
00:40:43,282 --> 00:40:44,747
She scores!

474
00:40:44,749 --> 00:40:46,548
Yeah!

475
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:49,952
And the crowd goes wild!

476
00:40:49,954 --> 00:40:51,823
Goal!

477
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:12,008
Ah, I need this,
Stefano.

478
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:14,477
I'm feeling stressed.

479
00:41:14,479 --> 00:41:16,945
An hardworking governor like me,

480
00:41:16,947 --> 00:41:19,983
stuck out in
this miserable wasteland?

481
00:41:19,985 --> 00:41:22,718
He deserves a few perks.

482
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,821
Simple pleasures
like fine food,

483
00:41:25,823 --> 00:41:30,426
a massage,
his own champion football team.

484
00:41:30,428 --> 00:41:32,664
Well, come on, chop-chop,
I haven't got all day.

485
00:41:34,932 --> 00:41:37,602
Oh, my tendons are like ropes.

486
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:40,870
You can go the whole hog.

487
00:41:40,872 --> 00:41:41,874
Hmm?

488
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:48,010
You're that crazy caveman guy.

489
00:41:48,012 --> 00:41:49,879
The angry pan girl.

490
00:41:49,881 --> 00:41:51,715
What are you doing here,
caveman?

491
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:54,517
This is the sacred turf.
No one's allowed here.

492
00:41:54,519 --> 00:41:56,055
- Balls.
- Huh?

493
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:58,120
I need balls.

494
00:41:58,122 --> 00:41:59,189
You came all this way

495
00:41:59,191 --> 00:42:02,461
and broke into the stadium
just to find some balls?

496
00:42:03,961 --> 00:42:06,465
Wow.
You're pretty brave, caveman.

497
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,066
And stupid.

498
00:42:10,068 --> 00:42:12,505
Actually,
more stupid than brave, really.

499
00:42:13,738 --> 00:42:14,740
Thanks.

500
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:16,976
I'm Goona, by the way.

501
00:42:18,776 --> 00:42:19,843
Dug.

502
00:42:20,945 --> 00:42:23,046
Come on, I can help.

503
00:42:23,048 --> 00:42:25,785
Ahh, ohh, eee...

504
00:42:30,155 --> 00:42:31,854
That's good!

505
00:42:31,856 --> 00:42:33,059
Mmm.

506
00:42:35,026 --> 00:42:38,461
I don't know what
the Queen is worrying about.

507
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:43,066
I mean, we all know
what losers cavemen are.

508
00:42:43,068 --> 00:42:46,539
Those Stone Age dolts couldn't
beat their own grandmothers.

509
00:42:47,104 --> 00:42:48,738
Brainless goons!

510
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:50,539
Gormless halfwits!

511
00:42:52,043 --> 00:42:55,577
Stefano! Not so ham-fisted!

512
00:42:55,579 --> 00:42:57,546
In fact, enough massage.

513
00:42:57,548 --> 00:43:00,552
How about
some relaxing music instead?

514
00:43:03,655 --> 00:43:04,689
Huh?

515
00:43:08,693 --> 00:43:09,695
I envy you.

516
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:12,896
- Me?
- The chance to play

517
00:43:12,898 --> 00:43:15,198
on that pitch, the sacred turf,

518
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,837
in front of thousands of fans!

519
00:43:19,503 --> 00:43:22,004
Well, maybe you will one day.

520
00:43:22,006 --> 00:43:24,543
You think they let girls play
for Real Bronzio?

521
00:43:25,577 --> 00:43:27,843
You really are crazy.

522
00:43:27,845 --> 00:43:29,678
Why do you think
I sneak in here?

523
00:43:30,782 --> 00:43:31,784
Who is that?

524
00:43:32,517 --> 00:43:33,816
Scarper!

525
00:43:33,818 --> 00:43:36,019
Stop! Thieves!

526
00:43:36,021 --> 00:43:37,089
This way!

527
00:43:41,992 --> 00:43:43,492
They went that way!

528
00:43:43,494 --> 00:43:45,830
- Huh?
- No! That way!

529
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:54,073
Give me those, quick!

530
00:44:00,878 --> 00:44:02,480
Ow!

531
00:44:03,581 --> 00:44:04,713
You're really good!

532
00:44:04,715 --> 00:44:05,717
Thanks!

533
00:44:06,918 --> 00:44:08,186
I do a lot of practice.

534
00:44:12,724 --> 00:44:14,957
Oh, I've just had
a great idea!

535
00:44:23,767 --> 00:44:25,804
Come on!

536
00:44:26,137 --> 00:44:27,139
Huh?

537
00:44:34,512 --> 00:44:37,582
What on Earth's
got into you tonight, Stefano?

538
00:44:38,182 --> 00:44:40,649
- Stefano?
- Yes, sir?

539
00:44:40,651 --> 00:44:41,653
Huh?

540
00:44:57,068 --> 00:44:58,204
Hognob!

541
00:45:00,238 --> 00:45:02,541
Hognob, meet Goona.
Goona, Hognob.

542
00:45:03,642 --> 00:45:04,643
Hi, Hognob.

543
00:45:18,055 --> 00:45:20,023
Sire, are you all right?

544
00:45:20,025 --> 00:45:23,292
Of course I'm not all right,
you idiot!

545
00:45:23,294 --> 00:45:26,130
I've just been massaged
by a pig!

546
00:45:35,773 --> 00:45:37,073
Wake up, everyone.

547
00:45:37,075 --> 00:45:39,608
I want you all to meet someone.

548
00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:41,778
This is Goona.

549
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,146
Hi!

550
00:45:43,148 --> 00:45:45,180
And she's gonna help us
win the game.

551
00:45:45,182 --> 00:45:46,983
- Oh.
- Why would she do that?

552
00:45:46,985 --> 00:45:49,251
She gets to play
on the sacred turf

553
00:45:49,253 --> 00:45:51,019
in front of thousands of fans.

554
00:45:51,021 --> 00:45:52,354
Whoa.

555
00:45:52,356 --> 00:45:53,990
Glad to be on board.

556
00:45:53,992 --> 00:45:56,725
So what formation
do you normally play?

557
00:45:56,727 --> 00:45:59,128
Um... Formation?

558
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:01,798
4-4-2 or 4-3-3?

559
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:02,899
Who's your sweeper?

560
00:46:02,901 --> 00:46:03,999
Um...

561
00:46:04,001 --> 00:46:05,334
Do you man-mark
or play zonally?

562
00:46:05,336 --> 00:46:06,936
Uh...

563
00:46:06,938 --> 00:46:09,372
We just kick the ball about
and chase it.

564
00:46:11,376 --> 00:46:14,309
You think you can beat
Real Bronzio

565
00:46:14,311 --> 00:46:16,114
just by chasing a ball around?

566
00:46:17,314 --> 00:46:19,251
You need to know
what you're up against.

567
00:46:23,021 --> 00:46:26,055
This is Jurgend, the captain.

568
00:46:26,057 --> 00:46:28,026
<i>Best goal-scorer
in the known world.</i>

569
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:31,294
- <i>Knows it too.</i>
- Ha!

570
00:46:31,296 --> 00:46:34,030
Their winger,
Lightning Hammer.

571
00:46:34,032 --> 00:46:36,832
<i>Never strikes twice
in the same place.</i>

572
00:46:39,303 --> 00:46:42,004
Midfield dynamo
Qwik Wun Tu.

573
00:46:42,006 --> 00:46:43,805
<i>He can kick faster
than you can think.</i>

574
00:46:45,343 --> 00:46:47,346
Fullback,
Gonad the Gaul.

575
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,684
<i>No one gets past his tackle.</i>

576
00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:56,352
- Oh!
- Aw, Mum!

577
00:46:56,354 --> 00:46:57,622
Make no mistake.

578
00:46:59,023 --> 00:47:01,890
These are the best players
bronze can buy.

579
00:47:01,892 --> 00:47:07,729
They're like ginormous
great big footballing giants!

580
00:47:07,731 --> 00:47:10,768
Oh, there's no way we can beat
such a great team.

581
00:47:11,802 --> 00:47:13,236
They may be great,

582
00:47:13,238 --> 00:47:15,240
but what they're not is a team.

583
00:47:17,175 --> 00:47:18,941
They're 11 players

584
00:47:18,943 --> 00:47:21,044
who each think they're the star.

585
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:22,745
That's their weakness.

586
00:47:22,747 --> 00:47:25,113
And that's how
you can beat them.

587
00:47:25,115 --> 00:47:26,851
- Oh.
- Hmm.

588
00:47:27,918 --> 00:47:29,385
Goona's right.

589
00:47:29,387 --> 00:47:32,055
They may be better
players than us,

590
00:47:32,057 --> 00:47:34,222
but we have something
they don't.

591
00:47:34,224 --> 00:47:36,225
- Huh?
- Moss?

592
00:47:36,227 --> 00:47:38,193
No, Barry, not moss.

593
00:47:38,195 --> 00:47:40,396
We've got each other.

594
00:47:40,398 --> 00:47:44,937
And if we work together,
then maybe we can do this.

595
00:47:47,805 --> 00:47:50,273
Right. We've got
a lot of hard work to do.

596
00:47:50,275 --> 00:47:52,441
And we haven't even got
a full team.

597
00:47:52,443 --> 00:47:54,209
Oh, oh!

598
00:47:54,211 --> 00:47:55,246
What's going on?

599
00:47:56,146 --> 00:47:58,080
Oh, Chief, this is Goona,

600
00:47:58,082 --> 00:47:59,881
and she's going to
help us win the game.

601
00:47:59,883 --> 00:48:02,017
I thought we're done
with football.

602
00:48:02,019 --> 00:48:05,021
Not now you've turned up.
You're in the team.

603
00:48:06,157 --> 00:48:08,327
I'm not playing.
I'm an old man.

604
00:48:09,193 --> 00:48:10,992
I'm nearly 32.

605
00:48:10,994 --> 00:48:12,394
Okay, that is old.

606
00:48:12,396 --> 00:48:14,796
- Go in goal.
- Ow!

607
00:48:14,798 --> 00:48:16,765
Right, well,
that's settled, then.

608
00:48:16,767 --> 00:48:19,468
Now, where's
your training facilities?

609
00:48:19,470 --> 00:48:21,870
Real Bronzio have the very best.

610
00:48:21,872 --> 00:48:24,372
And all we've got is

611
00:48:24,374 --> 00:48:27,843
the Badlands.

612
00:48:30,381 --> 00:48:32,284
Three, two, one.

613
00:48:33,485 --> 00:48:35,187
This way, everyone!

614
00:48:36,787 --> 00:48:38,921
Wait! What? Oh!
What are you doing?

615
00:48:38,923 --> 00:48:40,459
That way, everyone!

616
00:48:52,836 --> 00:48:54,803
Ow! Ah! Ooh!

617
00:48:54,805 --> 00:48:56,407
This is a bit dangerous.

618
00:49:03,947 --> 00:49:05,183
What are you... What the...

619
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:14,390
Eh? Well, I'll be...

620
00:49:14,392 --> 00:49:15,425
Okay. Pass and move.

621
00:49:15,427 --> 00:49:17,859
It's very important
that you pass and move.

622
00:49:17,861 --> 00:49:20,264
But whatever happens,
keep your formation.

623
00:49:40,885 --> 00:49:42,488
Oh! Oh!

624
00:49:50,894 --> 00:49:51,963
Ooh!

625
00:49:59,970 --> 00:50:02,070
Nice one, Asbo!
That's it!

626
00:50:02,072 --> 00:50:03,875
Everyone working together!

627
00:50:14,352 --> 00:50:16,318
Ugh! This is all I need.

628
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:19,088
You found these
in the primitives' valley?

629
00:50:19,090 --> 00:50:22,225
It seems their ancestors
were playing football

630
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:24,426
centuries before we were.

631
00:50:24,428 --> 00:50:27,329
The Queen must not find out
about this, all right?

632
00:50:29,133 --> 00:50:30,235
Delivering message!

633
00:50:30,869 --> 00:50:32,234
Oh, no.

634
00:50:32,236 --> 00:50:34,303
"What's this

635
00:50:34,305 --> 00:50:37,006
"I hear about the savages

636
00:50:37,008 --> 00:50:41,209
"playing football
centuries before we were?"

637
00:50:41,211 --> 00:50:43,312
Ow! Ow! I didn't know! Ow!

638
00:50:43,314 --> 00:50:47,983
"And my spies tell me
they're getting better.

639
00:50:47,985 --> 00:50:49,821
- Ow!
- "Training every day!"

640
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:52,120
Ow! Ow! Ow!

641
00:50:52,122 --> 00:50:57,459
"You better not screw it up,
Nooth, or else,

642
00:50:59,564 --> 00:51:03,298
"I'll tell you who'll be
going down the mine.

643
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:04,499
"You will!"

644
00:51:05,637 --> 00:51:07,669
This has gone far enough.

645
00:51:07,671 --> 00:51:09,305
They're Stone Age brutes.

646
00:51:09,307 --> 00:51:10,972
They live in caves.

647
00:51:10,974 --> 00:51:13,441
They eat mud! No.

648
00:51:13,443 --> 00:51:15,443
I need to shut them down.

649
00:51:15,445 --> 00:51:19,180
Mess with their
tiny cavemen minds.

650
00:51:19,182 --> 00:51:21,983
Brilliant! How do we do that?

651
00:51:21,985 --> 00:51:23,084
I don't know.

652
00:51:23,086 --> 00:51:25,655
The answer isn't just going
to walk in the door.

653
00:51:30,394 --> 00:51:32,461
Sire,
we've found something else

654
00:51:32,463 --> 00:51:34,629
down in the new mine
in the valley.

655
00:51:34,631 --> 00:51:36,999
We've made a copy
for your inspection.

656
00:51:37,001 --> 00:51:38,370
Oh! Ow!

657
00:51:48,979 --> 00:51:51,282
That's perfect.

658
00:51:51,682 --> 00:51:52,950
Mmm.

659
00:51:58,622 --> 00:51:59,624
Hognob.

660
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:06,428
Whoa! Great save, Chief!

661
00:52:06,430 --> 00:52:09,601
You know, we may just
stand a chance tomorrow.

662
00:52:10,233 --> 00:52:11,369
A small chance,

663
00:52:12,102 --> 00:52:13,169
but a chance.

664
00:52:13,171 --> 00:52:16,472
If our ancestors did it,
so can we.

665
00:52:16,474 --> 00:52:20,075
Hey, hey, not bad for 32, eh?

666
00:52:20,077 --> 00:52:21,644
I never thought
I'd say this, Dug,

667
00:52:21,646 --> 00:52:23,579
but we're pretty good.

668
00:52:23,581 --> 00:52:25,680
Oi, oi, oi! That's mine.

669
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:30,455
I've got it.

670
00:52:45,470 --> 00:52:47,602
Soon be home.

671
00:52:47,604 --> 00:52:49,106
Huh?

672
00:52:52,142 --> 00:52:53,244
Huh?

673
00:52:54,012 --> 00:52:55,046
No!

674
00:52:59,383 --> 00:53:01,017
What are you doing?

675
00:53:01,019 --> 00:53:02,187
Let me go!

676
00:53:03,588 --> 00:53:06,655
Calm down, caveman.

677
00:53:06,657 --> 00:53:09,593
I just wanted you
to see our new mine.

678
00:53:11,496 --> 00:53:15,231
After all, you'll soon be digging
lots of bronze out of it.

679
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:18,466
Oh, we're not going down
any mine, mammoth-mouth.

680
00:53:18,468 --> 00:53:20,403
Ah, yes.

681
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:22,738
Because you're
great footballers,

682
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:25,243
just like your ancestors.

683
00:53:26,177 --> 00:53:28,778
You... You know about them?

684
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:32,517
Bronze is not all
we found down here.

685
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:49,200
What... What...

686
00:53:51,436 --> 00:53:53,635
More cave paintings?

687
00:53:53,637 --> 00:53:55,106
Yes.

688
00:53:56,173 --> 00:53:59,610
Only these ones tell
the whole story.

689
00:54:01,711 --> 00:54:06,548
You see, your ancestors
did not just play football.

690
00:54:06,550 --> 00:54:08,253
They invented the game.

691
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:14,292
You even taught
other tribes how to play.

692
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:18,526
But you had one problem.

693
00:54:18,528 --> 00:54:21,530
No matter how hard you tried,

694
00:54:21,532 --> 00:54:25,070
you just always ended up losing,

695
00:54:26,204 --> 00:54:28,236
match after match,

696
00:54:28,238 --> 00:54:30,041
game after game.

697
00:54:31,541 --> 00:54:34,813
In fact, after many, many moons,

698
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:40,115
you just gave up altogether.

699
00:54:40,117 --> 00:54:42,852
It was all too painful for you.

700
00:54:42,854 --> 00:54:47,559
It turns out your tribe
were totally crap at football.

701
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:50,593
You're losers, caveman.

702
00:54:50,595 --> 00:54:52,495
Always have been.

703
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:53,896
Always will be.

704
00:54:53,898 --> 00:54:55,497
No.

705
00:54:55,499 --> 00:54:57,867
No, it can't be true.

706
00:54:57,869 --> 00:54:59,468
Do you really believe

707
00:54:59,470 --> 00:55:01,139
you can beat us tomorrow?

708
00:55:01,838 --> 00:55:03,539
Face it, caveman.

709
00:55:03,541 --> 00:55:07,345
You and your tribe,
you just don't have it in you.

710
00:55:08,813 --> 00:55:11,650
But I'm willing
to offer you a deal.

711
00:55:12,883 --> 00:55:14,619
A way out.

712
00:55:16,921 --> 00:55:19,687
Time to turn in.
Big day tomorrow.

713
00:55:19,689 --> 00:55:21,390
- Come on, Treebor!
- Night, Goona!

714
00:55:21,392 --> 00:55:23,225
Can I sleep
in me football kit?

715
00:55:23,227 --> 00:55:25,363
- Night, everyone!
- Night, everyone!

716
00:55:26,731 --> 00:55:27,732
Huh?

717
00:55:31,568 --> 00:55:33,434
Think it over, caveman,

718
00:55:33,436 --> 00:55:35,704
because the mine is waiting

719
00:55:35,706 --> 00:55:38,477
for you and
your primitive friends.

720
00:55:53,323 --> 00:55:55,524
Oh! Me arm hurts!

721
00:55:55,526 --> 00:55:56,959
Oh!

722
00:55:56,961 --> 00:55:58,928
Where are you, Mum?

723
00:56:00,831 --> 00:56:04,401
You idiot!
What have you done?

724
00:56:06,637 --> 00:56:07,769
At the end of the day,

725
00:56:07,771 --> 00:56:10,472
we're just
a rabbit-hunting tribe.

726
00:56:10,474 --> 00:56:12,441
I'm sorry, Chief!

727
00:56:12,443 --> 00:56:14,676
I didn't mean
for this to happen.

728
00:56:14,678 --> 00:56:16,644
Bobnar, you've got
to believe me!

729
00:56:21,352 --> 00:56:22,550
Huh?

730
00:56:22,552 --> 00:56:24,253
Oh, Hognob!

731
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:30,225
Oh!

732
00:56:30,227 --> 00:56:32,597
My dear old hoggy friend.

733
00:56:36,534 --> 00:56:38,169
What if I'm wrong?

734
00:56:39,704 --> 00:56:41,437
What if Chief was right
all along?

735
00:56:41,439 --> 00:56:42,472
Huh?

736
00:56:42,474 --> 00:56:46,644
What if we are just
a tribe of rabbit-hunters?

737
00:56:47,945 --> 00:56:49,245
Uh...

738
00:56:49,247 --> 00:56:50,515
Forgive me, Hognob.

739
00:56:51,916 --> 00:56:53,881
But I've got a deal to make.

740
00:56:53,883 --> 00:56:55,786
I've got to save the tribe.

741
00:57:05,396 --> 00:57:07,599
Huh?

742
00:57:20,878 --> 00:57:24,780
Get your cuddly caveman here!
Before they go extinct!

743
00:57:24,782 --> 00:57:26,347
One hundred schnookels!

744
00:57:26,349 --> 00:57:27,783
One hundred schnookels!

745
00:57:27,785 --> 00:57:31,019
Voluntary contribution.
Everyone has to pay.

746
00:57:31,021 --> 00:57:32,588
One hundred schnookels!

747
00:57:32,590 --> 00:57:35,291
- It has doubled!
- Voluntary contribution!

748
00:57:35,293 --> 00:57:37,559
- Everyone has to pay.
- This is outrageous!

749
00:57:37,561 --> 00:57:40,361
Have you got change
for a dinner plate?

750
00:57:42,465 --> 00:57:45,033
It's all going
to plan, Dino.

751
00:57:45,035 --> 00:57:48,803
Ooh. I love you,
little bronze coin.

752
00:57:48,805 --> 00:57:50,606
Hello!

753
00:57:50,608 --> 00:57:53,776
I love you. I love you too.
And you too.

754
00:57:53,778 --> 00:57:55,443
Nooth!

755
00:57:55,445 --> 00:57:57,312
What are you doing?

756
00:57:57,314 --> 00:57:59,715
Ugh. Not that stupid
old bird again.

757
00:57:59,717 --> 00:58:02,483
Tell Chef to boil it up
in a cassoulet.

758
00:58:03,854 --> 00:58:06,387
"Stupid old bird"?

759
00:58:07,758 --> 00:58:09,758
"Cassoulet"?

760
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:13,796
Oh!
Your Majesty!

761
00:58:13,798 --> 00:58:15,934
Why, this is an unexpected

762
00:58:16,599 --> 00:58:19,001
pleasure.

763
00:58:19,003 --> 00:58:22,637
Thought I'd come
to this caveman game myself.

764
00:58:22,639 --> 00:58:24,740
And have a little nose.

765
00:58:24,742 --> 00:58:27,479
A great honor,
Your Majesty.

766
00:58:29,447 --> 00:58:30,879
<i>And you have to say,
Brian,</i>

767
00:58:30,881 --> 00:58:35,517
<i>Real Bronzio's manager
is on the back foot.</i>

768
00:58:35,519 --> 00:58:37,553
<i>Oh, it's a terrible
start for the lad, Bryan.</i>

769
00:58:37,555 --> 00:58:39,588
<i>Terrible. I mean, just awful.</i>

770
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:42,423
<i>I put it down
to pre-match nerves.</i>

771
00:58:42,425 --> 00:58:43,959
<i>You're not wrong there, Brian.</i>

772
00:58:43,961 --> 00:58:47,432
I've brought
my royal commentators with me.

773
00:58:47,865 --> 00:58:48,867
Sit!

774
00:58:49,633 --> 00:58:51,466
Right.

775
00:58:51,468 --> 00:58:54,669
Well, let's start the fun,
shall we?

776
00:58:54,671 --> 00:58:57,508
<i>Bring out
the Stone Age challengers!</i>

777
00:59:08,651 --> 00:59:11,120
What? Where are you taking me?

778
00:59:11,122 --> 00:59:13,658
What on Earth are
you playing at?

779
00:59:22,733 --> 00:59:24,836
Oh, Dug.

780
00:59:39,717 --> 00:59:43,755
<i>Who challenge the champions?</i>

781
00:59:46,055 --> 00:59:49,825
You'll leave
my people alone as agreed?

782
00:59:49,827 --> 00:59:52,030
Yes, just say the words.

783
00:59:54,197 --> 00:59:55,763
Not me.

784
00:59:57,066 --> 00:59:59,434
I forfeit the game

785
00:59:59,436 --> 01:00:02,070
and volunteer myself
for the mines.

786
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:05,376
And?

787
01:00:06,709 --> 01:00:07,845
And our valley

788
01:00:08,912 --> 01:00:10,144
is yours.

789
01:00:10,146 --> 01:00:11,747
My goodness!

790
01:00:11,749 --> 01:00:13,618
Have the cavemen caved?

791
01:00:14,184 --> 01:00:17,119
Oh! So it seems.

792
01:00:17,121 --> 01:00:20,155
How very disappointing.

793
01:00:20,157 --> 01:00:24,428
<i>Everyone, go home!
There is no game.</i>

794
01:00:25,528 --> 01:00:28,729
<i>Apologies
for the inconvenience.</i>

795
01:00:28,731 --> 01:00:30,899
Tell the staff,
no refunds.

796
01:00:30,901 --> 01:00:33,135
Fowl! Fowl!

797
01:00:33,137 --> 01:00:36,838
<i>Foul? No one's even playing,
you silly slap-head!</i>

798
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:38,742
No, fowl!

799
01:00:56,727 --> 01:00:58,026
<i>Well, Brian,</i>

800
01:00:58,028 --> 01:01:00,731
<i>it looks like the Stone Age
team have just flown in.</i>

801
01:01:02,198 --> 01:01:03,298
<i>That's right, Bryan.</i>

802
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:06,033
<i>They're definitely looking
good in the air!</i>

803
01:01:06,035 --> 01:01:07,472
<i>See what I did there?</i>

804
01:01:08,771 --> 01:01:10,104
Oh, goodie.

805
01:01:10,106 --> 01:01:12,740
Seems there is a game
after all.

806
01:01:38,702 --> 01:01:40,535
Gonna start without us, Dug?

807
01:01:40,537 --> 01:01:43,004
Chief,
we can't play this game.

808
01:01:43,006 --> 01:01:45,573
What, because of
a few paintings?

809
01:01:45,575 --> 01:01:48,943
So you know about
those terrible pictures?

810
01:01:48,945 --> 01:01:50,144
They are terrible.

811
01:01:50,146 --> 01:01:52,314
I can draw better than that.

812
01:01:52,316 --> 01:01:54,052
But that's all they are.

813
01:01:54,885 --> 01:01:55,887
Pictures.

814
01:01:58,088 --> 01:01:59,657
It's this lot that counts.

815
01:02:00,557 --> 01:02:02,291
You were right, Dug.

816
01:02:02,293 --> 01:02:05,093
I thought
we were just rabbit-hunters.

817
01:02:05,095 --> 01:02:06,894
Well, not anymore.

818
01:02:06,896 --> 01:02:09,196
You've shown me that.

819
01:02:09,198 --> 01:02:11,666
Who's playing with Dug

820
01:02:11,668 --> 01:02:13,167
for the valley?

821
01:02:13,169 --> 01:02:15,273
Champion.

822
01:02:16,573 --> 01:02:18,976
It's what Mr. Rock
would've wanted.

823
01:02:28,718 --> 01:02:32,653
We challenge the champions!

824
01:02:34,358 --> 01:02:37,095
<i>Your funeral, caveman!</i>

825
01:02:41,731 --> 01:02:44,666
<i>This may be
an uneven contest, Brian,</i>

826
01:02:44,668 --> 01:02:47,068
<i>but let's hope
it's at least entertaining.</i>

827
01:02:47,070 --> 01:02:49,206
Ha! Let's get this done.

828
01:02:55,845 --> 01:02:56,880
What?

829
01:02:58,314 --> 01:03:00,115
Let's do it!

830
01:03:00,117 --> 01:03:01,686
<i>Oh! Well, this is interesting.</i>

831
01:03:03,287 --> 01:03:05,086
Hey, Hügelgraber!

832
01:03:05,088 --> 01:03:07,659
Wake up!

833
01:03:08,392 --> 01:03:09,928
<i>Very interesting!</i>

834
01:03:14,664 --> 01:03:15,830
Huh?

835
01:03:22,405 --> 01:03:24,773
<i>I don't believe it,</i>

836
01:03:24,775 --> 01:03:27,075
<i>Bryan! The Stone Age team</i>

837
01:03:27,077 --> 01:03:29,581
<i>have caught
their opponents napping.</i>

838
01:03:31,347 --> 01:03:34,950
Beginners' luck, Your Majesty.

839
01:03:34,952 --> 01:03:35,954
Hmph.

840
01:03:38,756 --> 01:03:40,321
Bad move, caveman.

841
01:03:40,323 --> 01:03:42,026
Now you've just made us mad.

842
01:03:46,329 --> 01:03:47,396
Oh!

843
01:03:47,398 --> 01:03:48,829
Yay!

844
01:03:48,831 --> 01:03:50,832
<i>And normal service
is restored!</i>

845
01:03:50,834 --> 01:03:54,301
Jurgend! Jurgend!

846
01:03:54,303 --> 01:03:55,939
<i>Let's see the replay,
Bryan.</i>

847
01:03:57,974 --> 01:04:00,242
Ooh, <i>ja,</i> kick!

848
01:04:00,244 --> 01:04:02,276
Yay! Goal!

849
01:04:02,278 --> 01:04:04,379
<i>You can't argue
with the puppets, Bryan.</i>

850
01:04:04,381 --> 01:04:05,946
Kissy-kissy!
Hug, hug, hug!

851
01:04:05,948 --> 01:04:08,151
<i>Aye,
the puppets don't lie, Brian.</i>

852
01:04:09,952 --> 01:04:12,053
Oh!

853
01:04:12,055 --> 01:04:13,921
Oh! Ah,
and that's a goal.

854
01:04:13,923 --> 01:04:15,356
That's two.

855
01:04:15,358 --> 01:04:16,425
<i>Real Bronzio are in</i>

856
01:04:16,427 --> 01:04:18,727
- <i>no mood to compromise.</i>
- Goal!

857
01:04:18,729 --> 01:04:20,798
Never mind. Come on, everyone!

858
01:04:23,032 --> 01:04:24,635
Boo!

859
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:31,238
<i>And surely,
that's settled it.</i>

860
01:04:33,943 --> 01:04:35,977
Yay!

861
01:04:40,483 --> 01:04:43,785
<i>Well, it's halftime,
Bryan, and Real Bronzio</i>

862
01:04:43,787 --> 01:04:45,454
<i>are dominating this match.</i>

863
01:04:45,456 --> 01:04:48,055
<i>♪ You're going down the mine!</i>

864
01:04:48,057 --> 01:04:50,191
<i>♪ You're going down the mine! ♪</i>

865
01:04:50,193 --> 01:04:53,894
The only place we're going
is back to the valley.

866
01:04:53,896 --> 01:04:55,497
Now come on, everyone!

867
01:04:55,499 --> 01:04:57,301
Let's show them what we've got!

868
01:05:07,510 --> 01:05:09,213
Remember your training, Eemak!

869
01:05:24,061 --> 01:05:26,394
Nice one, Eemak! That's it!

870
01:05:26,396 --> 01:05:29,396
<i>Goodness me, it looks
like a caveman counterattack.</i>

871
01:05:29,398 --> 01:05:31,735
Come on, then.
Let's see your tackle.

872
01:05:35,171 --> 01:05:36,407
Great work, Magma!

873
01:05:37,441 --> 01:05:39,006
Hey, hey!

874
01:05:40,309 --> 01:05:41,943
What was that?

875
01:05:41,945 --> 01:05:44,245
<i>Oh-ho!
Unorthodox, Bryan,</i>

876
01:05:44,247 --> 01:05:45,416
<i>but effective.</i>

877
01:05:47,151 --> 01:05:49,383
- <i>This is unprecedented!</i>
- Yay!

878
01:05:49,385 --> 01:05:51,253
<i>I can't remember any side</i>

879
01:05:51,255 --> 01:05:54,124
<i>scoring two goals
against Real Bronzio.</i>

880
01:05:56,559 --> 01:05:58,859
Oh, you fool.
What were you playing at?

881
01:05:58,861 --> 01:06:00,195
You silly, stupid...

882
01:06:00,197 --> 01:06:03,198
Idiot! Do I have to do
everything around here?

883
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:04,999
Caveman coming through!

884
01:06:05,001 --> 01:06:07,804
Nibbles, Your Majesty?

885
01:06:08,939 --> 01:06:10,070
Stuff your nibbles!

886
01:06:10,072 --> 01:06:11,907
<i>Well, Real Bronzio,</i>

887
01:06:11,909 --> 01:06:14,111
<i>they just don't know what's
hit them, they really don't.</i>

888
01:06:20,983 --> 01:06:24,385
<i>Oh-ho! The Stone Age team
is really coming together, Bryan.</i>

889
01:06:24,387 --> 01:06:27,454
<i>You're not wrong,
Brian. It's like early man</i>

890
01:06:27,456 --> 01:06:30,291
united. That's another joke
there, Brian.

891
01:06:30,293 --> 01:06:32,426
<i>Oh, look at this!</i>

892
01:06:32,428 --> 01:06:35,129
<i>The Stone Age striker
beats one,</i>

893
01:06:35,131 --> 01:06:36,834
<i>nutmegs another...</i>

894
01:06:38,568 --> 01:06:40,367
All yours, Goona!

895
01:06:40,369 --> 01:06:41,371
Hmm.

896
01:06:42,472 --> 01:06:44,108
<i>She's going all the way.</i>

897
01:06:46,376 --> 01:06:48,910
<i>She shoots.</i>

898
01:06:48,912 --> 01:06:50,047
<i>She scores!</i>

899
01:06:52,416 --> 01:06:54,983
The crowd are going wild!

900
01:06:54,985 --> 01:06:58,053
- <i>And who can blame them?</i>
- Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

901
01:06:59,423 --> 01:07:00,321
Wait a minute!

902
01:07:00,323 --> 01:07:02,591
She shouldn't even be
on the pitch.

903
01:07:02,593 --> 01:07:04,358
And why not?

904
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:06,126
Because she's a...

905
01:07:08,298 --> 01:07:10,434
A great player!

906
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:12,968
You lot!

907
01:07:12,970 --> 01:07:14,602
Get your act together!

908
01:07:14,604 --> 01:07:18,342
Unless you want to be suspended
for the rest of the season.

909
01:07:18,642 --> 01:07:19,877
Play on!

910
01:07:25,314 --> 01:07:27,082
Hmm...

911
01:07:27,084 --> 01:07:28,419
- Psst. Dino! Dino!
- Eh?

912
01:07:30,586 --> 01:07:34,391
- Have you got your rule book handy?
- Of course.

913
01:07:35,559 --> 01:07:38,361
Good. Because
I'm throwing it at you.

914
01:07:38,628 --> 01:07:39,963
Eh?

915
01:07:43,099 --> 01:07:44,666
Come on, everyone.

916
01:07:44,668 --> 01:07:47,434
One last goal
will take us home.

917
01:07:49,106 --> 01:07:50,939
Dino is having a lie-down.

918
01:07:50,941 --> 01:07:53,044
I am the new ref.

919
01:07:54,177 --> 01:07:55,977
Well, that's not fair!

920
01:07:55,979 --> 01:07:57,245
Oh, isn't it?

921
01:07:57,247 --> 01:07:58,914
Let's ask the new ref.

922
01:07:58,916 --> 01:08:00,582
Ref, is it fair?

923
01:08:00,584 --> 01:08:03,050
Oh, yes, it's totally fair.

924
01:08:03,052 --> 01:08:04,487
Okay. Play on!

925
01:08:05,454 --> 01:08:08,425
It's injury time. Understand?

926
01:08:16,599 --> 01:08:18,969
- Ooh!
- <i>Oh, that's not cricket, Bryan.</i>

927
01:08:19,937 --> 01:08:21,101
<i>Whatever cricket is.</i>

928
01:08:21,103 --> 01:08:23,203
Nothing to see there. Play on.

929
01:08:25,207 --> 01:08:27,409
- No!
- I didn't see anything.

930
01:08:27,411 --> 01:08:29,347
No foul! Play on!

931
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:34,315
No, no. Get up. Play on.

932
01:08:36,119 --> 01:08:38,255
<i>Oh, that's
way below the belt.</i>

933
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,066
Chief!

934
01:08:52,068 --> 01:08:54,071
<i>Oh, caveman down,
Brian!</i>

935
01:09:04,281 --> 01:09:07,248
Oh, my leg! Oh, my leg!

936
01:09:07,250 --> 01:09:09,351
Hurts so bad!

937
01:09:09,353 --> 01:09:11,252
Penalty!

938
01:09:11,254 --> 01:09:13,457
<i>Jurgend should get
a prize for acting.</i>

939
01:09:14,090 --> 01:09:16,557
Chief? Chief?

940
01:09:16,559 --> 01:09:18,760
Ha! I soon have it fixed.

941
01:09:18,762 --> 01:09:20,561
Oh, great.

942
01:09:20,563 --> 01:09:22,663
Um... Huh?

943
01:09:22,665 --> 01:09:25,033
Ha. There. Good job.

944
01:09:25,035 --> 01:09:27,534
Come on,
that was never a penalty!

945
01:09:27,536 --> 01:09:29,636
Fine.
Check the replay.

946
01:09:29,638 --> 01:09:32,239
Oh, kick, ahh! Referee!

947
01:09:32,241 --> 01:09:33,708
Oh, my leg! My leg!

948
01:09:33,710 --> 01:09:36,644
Oh, no, the crocodile!

949
01:09:36,646 --> 01:09:39,413
Snack, snack, snack.

950
01:09:39,415 --> 01:09:41,349
Oh, terrible foul!

951
01:09:41,351 --> 01:09:43,150
Beating him with sausages!

952
01:09:43,152 --> 01:09:45,787
Shame on you.
Definite penalty.

953
01:09:48,759 --> 01:09:53,560
<i>A draw is just not good enough
for the primitive part-timers, Bryan.</i>

954
01:09:53,562 --> 01:09:54,796
<i>And now this.</i>

955
01:09:54,798 --> 01:09:57,399
<i>A Real Bronzio penalty</i>

956
01:09:57,401 --> 01:10:00,068
<i>in the dying moments
of the match.</i>

957
01:10:00,070 --> 01:10:03,307
<i>Aye, and the goalie
looks in a bad way too.</i>

958
01:10:06,610 --> 01:10:08,446
Dug...

959
01:10:08,745 --> 01:10:10,544
Chief?

960
01:10:10,546 --> 01:10:14,117
I spent my whole life
hunting rabbits.

961
01:10:16,486 --> 01:10:17,755
I held you back.

962
01:10:19,423 --> 01:10:20,558
I'm sorry.

963
01:10:21,558 --> 01:10:24,428
I'm so...

964
01:10:29,198 --> 01:10:30,265
Chief?

965
01:10:31,634 --> 01:10:34,104
Chief!

966
01:10:38,107 --> 01:10:39,376
Huh?

967
01:10:45,615 --> 01:10:47,080
Dug,

968
01:10:47,082 --> 01:10:51,718
I don't mean to worry you, but what
are we going to do for a goalie?

969
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:05,036
Hognob?

970
01:11:08,104 --> 01:11:09,173
Okay!

971
01:11:12,576 --> 01:11:16,347
<i>My word. Is that a pig
they just put in goal?</i>

972
01:11:18,380 --> 01:11:20,614
<i>Have to say that's rather rash.</i>

973
01:11:20,616 --> 01:11:23,118
- <i>Rasher. Do you get it? Bacon.</i>
- Mmm.

974
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:25,552
I've never missed a penalty.

975
01:11:25,554 --> 01:11:29,591
Not against a pig anyway.

976
01:11:29,593 --> 01:11:31,325
<i>And it looks like
it's all over</i>

977
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:34,729
<i>for this plucky band
of knuckle-grazers, Bryan.</i>

978
01:11:34,731 --> 01:11:36,396
<i>A great effort,</i>

979
01:11:36,398 --> 01:11:39,135
<i>but, in the end,
it wasn't quite enough.</i>

980
01:11:44,540 --> 01:11:48,578
Say goodbye
to your valley, caveman.

981
01:11:49,778 --> 01:11:51,546
Come on, Hognob.

982
01:11:51,548 --> 01:11:52,683
You can do it.

983
01:12:17,406 --> 01:12:18,940
<i>He's got
a trotter to it!</i>

984
01:12:21,644 --> 01:12:23,877
<i>It's still
in play, Brian.</i>

985
01:12:27,550 --> 01:12:30,351
Dug. Dug!

986
01:12:30,353 --> 01:12:33,323
<i>You were always
a mammoth-hunter!</i>

987
01:12:34,758 --> 01:12:36,757
<i>Dug! Over here!</i>

988
01:12:36,759 --> 01:12:39,195
<i>Go hunt mammoth!</i>

989
01:12:40,897 --> 01:12:42,900
Everyone! Give me a hand!

990
01:12:43,567 --> 01:12:45,870
My ball!

991
01:12:53,442 --> 01:12:56,179
Don't crowd me!

992
01:13:16,866 --> 01:13:20,467
<i>That is an amazing goal!</i>

993
01:13:20,469 --> 01:13:22,505
Yay!

994
01:13:25,442 --> 01:13:27,374
<i>Look at that.</i>

995
01:13:27,376 --> 01:13:29,843
<i>The giant duck is on the pitch.</i>

996
01:13:29,845 --> 01:13:31,348
<i>He thinks it's all over.</i>

997
01:13:37,554 --> 01:13:38,756
<i>It is now!</i>

998
01:13:45,695 --> 01:13:47,531
Is this as good
as you imagined?

999
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:49,366
No.

1000
01:13:50,799 --> 01:13:52,033
It's better!

1001
01:13:52,035 --> 01:13:53,304
Yeah!

1002
01:13:58,741 --> 01:14:01,378
Well done, my old hoggy friend!

1003
01:14:01,745 --> 01:14:03,310
You cheat!

1004
01:14:03,312 --> 01:14:06,249
You are a disgrace to football!

1005
01:14:07,951 --> 01:14:09,353
Oh!

1006
01:14:16,492 --> 01:14:17,624
Hmm?

1007
01:14:17,626 --> 01:14:18,762
Good game.

1008
01:14:21,997 --> 01:14:23,765
<i>Ja.</i>

1009
01:14:23,767 --> 01:14:25,702
Well played, caveman.

1010
01:14:26,835 --> 01:14:27,972
So...

1011
01:14:28,437 --> 01:14:29,738
Huh?

1012
01:14:29,740 --> 01:14:34,378
You've reminded us how the
beautiful game should be played.

1013
01:14:36,345 --> 01:14:39,314
As for Lord Nooth...

1014
01:14:39,316 --> 01:14:42,686
Nooth? Nooth! Where is that...

1015
01:14:43,585 --> 01:14:46,022
- Rat!
- Yes, quite!

1016
01:14:48,924 --> 01:14:50,992
Guards!

1017
01:14:50,994 --> 01:14:53,731
Apprehend that rodent!

1018
01:14:54,731 --> 01:14:56,830
So long, suckers!

1019
01:14:56,832 --> 01:14:58,099
<i>My word, Bryan.</i>

1020
01:14:58,101 --> 01:15:00,034
<i>That schnookel-grabbing
scoundrel</i>

1021
01:15:00,036 --> 01:15:01,905
<i>is making off
with the profits!</i>

1022
01:15:02,539 --> 01:15:03,738
After you.

1023
01:15:03,740 --> 01:15:05,506
<i>Aye,
but will he get away?</i>

1024
01:15:07,477 --> 01:15:09,813
- <i>Oh, superb shot!</i>
- <i>And a rebound!</i>

1025
01:15:10,780 --> 01:15:11,779
<i>Oh, that got him!</i>

1026
01:15:11,781 --> 01:15:14,882
<i>Aye, Nooth is on
the back foot now, Brian.</i>

1027
01:15:14,884 --> 01:15:17,418
<i>Quite literally.</i>

1028
01:15:21,657 --> 01:15:22,757
<i>Look at that.</i>

1029
01:15:22,759 --> 01:15:25,126
- <i>Caught by the old bill.</i>
- <i>Oh, Bryan,</i>

1030
01:15:25,128 --> 01:15:27,497
<i>that's comedy bronze.
Well done, my friend.</i>

1031
01:15:36,673 --> 01:15:38,940
No! My lovely schnookels!

1032
01:15:45,381 --> 01:15:46,784
Yay!

1033
01:15:47,549 --> 01:15:49,717
Oh, refund.

1034
01:15:49,719 --> 01:15:52,856
That should remind him
of the pecking order, eh?

1035
01:15:53,455 --> 01:15:54,521
Yeah.

1036
01:15:54,523 --> 01:15:56,923
Oh, and, caveman,

1037
01:15:56,925 --> 01:15:59,929
I think this is yours.

1038
01:16:09,171 --> 01:16:13,474
Symbol of a game sent
from heaven.

1039
01:16:13,476 --> 01:16:15,476
Thank you, Your...

1040
01:16:15,478 --> 01:16:18,413
Bronze Chiefness.

1041
01:16:18,415 --> 01:16:21,652
And now, I believe
it's time you went home,

1042
01:16:25,754 --> 01:16:27,457
to your valley.

1043
01:16:33,495 --> 01:16:34,997
We're going home.

1044
01:16:48,812 --> 01:16:50,714
Oh, hey!

1045
01:17:49,992 --> 01:17:54,992
