1771
01:22:48,930 --> 01:22:54,312
<i>J' Are we like you?
I can't be sure</i>

1772
01:22:54,369 --> 01:22:57,646
J' Of the scene
As she turns

1773
01:22:57,706 --> 01:23:00,277
J' We are strange
in our worlds

1774
01:23:00,342 --> 01:23:04,313
J' But we are young
We get by

1775
01:23:04,379 --> 01:23:07,588
J' Can't go mad
Ain't got time

1776
01:23:07,649 --> 01:23:10,596
J' Sleep around
If we like

1777
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:12,928
J' But we're all right

1778
01:23:14,055 --> 01:23:17,502
J' Got some cash
Bought some wheels

1779
01:23:17,559 --> 01:23:20,768
J' Took it out
Across the fields

1780
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:23,776
J' Lost control
Hit a wall

1781
01:23:23,832 --> 01:23:26,108
J' But we're all right

1782
01:23:28,536 --> 01:23:33,918
<i>J' Are we like you?
I can't be sure</i>

1783
01:23:33,975 --> 01:23:37,286
J' Of the scene
As she turns

1784
01:23:37,345 --> 01:23:39,951
J' We are strange
in our worlds

1785
01:23:40,015 --> 01:23:43,986
J' But we are young
We run green

1786
01:23:44,052 --> 01:23:47,329
J' Keep our teeth
Nice and clean

1787
01:23:47,389 --> 01:23:50,268
J' See our friends
See the sights

1788
01:23:50,325 --> 01:23:53,568
J' Feel all right

1789
01:24:37,705 --> 01:24:42,882
<i>J' Are we like you?
I can't be sure</i>

1790
01:24:42,944 --> 01:24:46,221
J' Of the scene
As she turns

1791
01:24:46,281 --> 01:24:49,057
J' We are strange
in our worlds

1792
01:24:49,117 --> 01:24:53,031
J' But we are young
We run green

1793
01:24:53,088 --> 01:24:56,297
J' Keep our teeth
Nice and clean

1794
01:24:56,357 --> 01:24:59,236
J' See our friends
See the sights

1795
01:24:59,294 --> 01:25:02,707
J' Feel all right J'
