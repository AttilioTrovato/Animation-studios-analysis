00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:27,611
<i>Hello. I'm Sam Fell.</i>

2
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:32,032
<i>And I'm David Bowers. And welcome to
the director commentary on</i> Flushed Away.

3
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:54,471
<i>With the opening shot
of the movie, London.</i>

4
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:55,847
<i>So, the film's set in London.</i>

5
00:00:55,931 --> 00:01:00,394
<i>And we wanted to make it feel like
a really London, British movie,</i>

6
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:03,564
<i>so, you knew exactly where we were
when we started.</i>

7
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:05,899
<i>So, we went for all the, like,
the London landmarks.</i>

8
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:08,360
<i>All the famous ones
that everyone knows around the world.</i>

9
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:11,723
<i>And we had some others, but they, people
weren't quite so aware of them, were they?</i>

10
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,449
<i>No, we, we tried to pick landmarks
that we were doing</i>

11
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:16,952
<i>when Roddy goes into the city later
that we, we'd see there.</i>

12
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,638
<i>So, we'd see our own version
of Tower Bridge</i>

13
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:20,747
<i>and we'd see our own version of Big Ben.</i>

14
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:21,999
<i>Yeah. And all this is...</i>

15
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,334
<i>I remember all this is, like, we did this,</i>

16
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:26,378
<i>sort of, near the end
of the production, really,</i>

17
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:27,588
<i>this opening sequence.</i>

18
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:30,716
<i>And it was all really about just,
sort of, grabbing the audience and,</i>

19
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,302
<i>and, kind of, really announcing the film.</i>

20
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:36,847
<i>And Harry Gregson did an amazing score
there at the start, didn't he?</i>

21
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:37,848
<i>- I loved that.
- He did.</i>

22
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,892
<i>Just sort of launched us into...
big movie territory.</i>

23
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:42,811
<i>Yeah. Here we are and...</i>

24
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:45,397
<i>That's the introduction
to our hero, Roddy.</i>

25
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,899
<i>Yeah. And he, and he lives in a cage.</i>

26
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:48,983
<i>He's got a nose.</i>

27
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:53,196
<i>And I think the idea was
that he doesn't wear clothes all the time.</i>

28
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,033
<i>He just puts clothes on
when the family go away.</i>

29
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,436
<i>But that's maybe not quite clear.</i>

30
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:59,052
<i>But it doesn't really matter, you know?</i>

31
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:01,413
<i>'Cause the film's not
really about the family.</i>

32
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:04,374
<i>It's more about Roddy being on his own
in this big place,</i>

33
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:08,754
<i>and just loving this,
loving this life he has here.</i>

34
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:10,189
Hey, what are you all
standing around for...

35
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:13,175
<i>I mean, Roddy wasn't always this,
sort of, exciting, excitable.</i>

36
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:17,387
<i>We had... He went through very,
many iterations of Roddy, really.</i>

37
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:21,475
<i>Yeah, the first Roddy was, like, this...
he was more like David Niven, wasn't he?</i>

38
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:25,646
<i>He was like a very elegant,
rather, sort of, staid Englishman.</i>

39
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:29,441
<i>And he even had a couple
of hamster butlers, didn't he...</i>

40
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:31,151
<i>- He did.
- Very early on, you know?</i>

41
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:34,905
<i>But it was a bit of a slow start
to the film, really, wasn't it?</i>

42
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,281
<i>You know, it's just, like...</i>

43
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:37,550
<i>It changed. He wasn't fun enough.</i>

44
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,734
<i>And so we just,
we just jumped in to make him more fun.</i>

45
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:40,827
<i>More energetic.</i>

46
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:43,747
<i>But I think the main, the main thing is
that he just loves this life</i>

47
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,207
<i>and thinks he's got everything.</i>

48
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:49,461
<i>Although, I think, I think it's clear,
just from watching this,</i>

49
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:52,297
<i>that he probably hasn't,
he hasn't quite got everything, is he?</i>

50
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:54,101
<i>'Cause it's, it's a bit weird
hanging around</i>

51
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,732
<i>with a bunch of dolls, really, you know?</i>

52
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:58,261
Game point! Service!

53
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,472
We win. We win, team! We win.

54
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:04,267
<i>He's quite lively.</i>

55
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,478
<i>- He is full of beans.
- He's lively, you know.</i>

56
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,775
<i>And then we go into this James Bond thing,
didn't we?</i>

57
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,294
<i>- We liked the thought of being...
- We did.</i>

58
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:15,862
<i>Also, very funny titles on that DVD shelf.</i>

59
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:17,823
<i>Yeah. We pause it.</i>

60
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:20,325
- All the President's Own Teeth.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

61
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:23,537
<i>That was a little... homage to James Bond.</i>

62
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,932
<i>And it's kinda fun, I guess,
that he, you know,</i>

63
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:30,544
<i>wears that tuxedo and thinks he's a
bit of a Bond character. Bit of a playboy.</i>

64
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,464
Having a good time, darling?

65
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:43,139
Thank you.

66
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:47,436
See you tomorrow!

67
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,759
<i>- I love that. It's funny, isn't it?
- I love this scene.</i>

68
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:56,820
<i>And, off he goes to bed, on his own.</i>

69
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,283
Good night.

70
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:04,327
<i>And that was the whole reason for picking
"Dancing By Myself," wasn't it?</i>

71
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,954
<i>The Billy Idol track.</i>

72
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,561
<i>We thought it was a bit gloomy,
but it really told the story.</i>

73
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,920
<i>Yeah. But it sets the character up
really well, doesn't it?</i>

74
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:17,466
<i>And, you know, coupled with him
just muck playing with the dolls.</i>

75
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:21,136
<i>You can sorta tell that there's something
missing in his life, I guess,</i>

76
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,679
<i>from that opening sequence.</i>

77
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,264
<i>It is.</i>

78
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:26,187
<i>I mean, well, I think,
well, this next scene...</i>

79
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,285
<i>- Says it all, doesn't it?
- It does.</i>

80
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:29,436
<i>Sort of passed over from being
slightly eccentric</i>

81
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,979
<i>to actual mental illness.</i>

82
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,231
<i>- He's actually mad, isn't he?
- He is.</i>

83
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:36,735
<i>There really is, like,
something lacking there.</i>

84
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:39,738
<i>This is... this was, we thought this was
quite political at the time.</i>

85
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,115
<i>Yeah. It was a bit funny, wasn't it,</i>

86
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:46,286
<i>having the, the guy mention weapons
of mass destruction and stuff.</i>

87
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,540
<i>This felt a bit odd to, kind of, you know,</i>

88
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:53,001
<i>step into the political arena
a little bit.</i>

89
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,795
<i>- But it was funny, so we left it.
- Yeah.</i>

90
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:56,647
<i>- We liked it.
- It's just a joke, isn't it, really?</i>

91
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,941
<i>I think we're most successful
when we try and make ourselves laugh,</i>

92
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,235
<i>- aren't we, really?
- Yeah, no, I mean, like, it's been a lau...</i>

93
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,899
<i>I've really enjoyed the whole thing,
it has been a laugh, you know?</i>

94
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:06,348
<i>Just tryin' to think of things
that make you laugh.</i>

95
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,600
<i>- Me personally?
- Yeah. You personally.</i>

96
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,411
<i>- Thank you.
- 'Cause I like to see you smile.</i>

97
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:11,829
<i>- I like to...
- I've got a lovely smile.</i>

98
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,480
<i>Yes, yes, you've got a nice smile.</i>

99
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,858
<i>Yeah. But it's funny, isn't it?
'Cause as we worked on this film,</i>

100
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:20,153
<i>this, the, the opening of the film
got shorter and shorter, really, you know?</i>

101
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:21,255
<i>And we were just trying to...</i>

102
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:25,408
<i>In the end we found that we really wanted
to get to this point when Sid arrives,</i>

103
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,202
<i>kind of, as soon as we could.</i>

104
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,621
<i>Because, you know, you can spend so long,</i>

105
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:32,916
<i>like, mucking around and showing
a character and have him, you know,</i>

106
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:37,754
<i>in his little world, but until there's
a story there, there's nothing really...</i>

107
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,558
<i>And the story doesn't really start until...</i>

108
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:43,051
<i>- Roddy is flushed down his own loo.
- Yeah.</i>

109
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,071
<i>So, that's what we had to...
that's what we had to race for.</i>

110
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:46,805
<i>Yeah. I guess this is it, isn't it?</i>

111
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,598
<i>Now, now his world's invaded.</i>

112
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,600
<i>Now it's interesting. Now there's a drama.</i>

113
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,909
<i>There's something going on between them.</i>

114
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:54,145
I don't know!

115
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:56,857
<i>It's so great to see Hugh
and Shane doing this scene because we,</i>

116
00:05:57,232 --> 00:06:00,026
<i>we asked when we were trying
to develop the character of Roddy,</i>

117
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,070
<i>we eventually decided not
to make him a snob,</i>

118
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:03,673
<i>and to move away from the class thing.</i>

119
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,533
<i>And we just wanted to be more,
more like Hugh,</i>

120
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:09,703
<i>who is a very funny,
very charming, lovely man.</i>

121
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,806
<i>And he's, sort of,
always enthusiastic about, you know,</i>

122
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:16,209
<i>even though we've had him come in
here hundreds of times for the same lines</i>

123
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:19,629
<i>over and over again 'cause we
tend to noodle around with things forever.</i>

124
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:22,215
<i>He's... he was always,
he's always game for it.</i>

125
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,509
<i>- Yeah.
- And you know,</i>

126
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:28,013
<i>he's a really great,
like, comedian as well.</i>

127
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:32,851
<i>And Shane was fantastic as Sid. Shane
just came in, he ad-libbed, he had fun.</i>

128
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:35,288
<i>And he, you know, again, we had
Shane come in loads and loads of times.</i>

129
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,439
<i>But he was always,
he was always up for it,</i>

130
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:38,773
<i>no matter how silly the jokes.</i>

131
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:40,066
<i>He's so enthusiastic.</i>

132
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,443
<i>He brought so much to the role.</i>

133
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:42,861
<i>Yeah. Yeah.</i>

134
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,905
<i>England versus Germany
in the World Cup Final.</i>

135
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,575
<i>Not really the most
fantastical element of the story, I guess.</i>

136
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:49,898
<i>We were hoping it would happen.</i>

137
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,995
<i>But, predictably, it didn't.</i>

138
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,057
<i>It was weird, actually,
'cause as it was going on,</i>

139
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,333
<i>that we were thinking...</i>

140
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,044
<i>for a moment we did think
they might get into the final, you know?</i>

141
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,963
<i>- We did. We did.
- Like, it was silly, really.</i>

142
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,341
<i>- I don't know what got into us.
- Yeah.</i>

143
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:06,843
<i>But then when they lost, we thought,</i>

144
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:09,614
<i>"It doesn't really matter, you know,
it's just part of the film, isn't it?"</i>

145
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:10,764
<i>- It's just silly.
- Yeah.</i>

146
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:15,018
<i>And I love all the soccer footage
that we, you know,</i>

147
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,941
<i>we just let the animators
go mad on that stuff.</i>

148
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,999
<i>And they j, just said, like,
"Just make it funny."</i>

149
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:23,109
<i>And if you watch the, watch the soccer
footage throughout the film,</i>

150
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:27,656
<i>it's always funny
stuff going on on the screen, you know?</i>

151
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:29,783
The kitchen, Jeeves.
And be snappy about it.

152
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:33,035
Yes, sir.

153
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:35,497
- Right away, sir.
- That's more like it.

154
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,917
But, before breakfast is served...

155
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,712
perhaps Sir would care to take a whirl
in the Jacuzzi?

156
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:45,548
A Jacuzzi.

157
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,488
You know what you are? You're a real gent.

158
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:52,722
Well, after a hard day
of navigating sewer pipes,

159
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:57,727
there's nothing better than relaxing
in a Jacuzzi, whirlpool bath.

160
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:00,063
That looks so inviting.

161
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,524
Yes, yes. The water looks perfect.

162
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:06,987
Now, you hop in and I'll press this lever
to get the bubbles going.

163
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,489
Right. In we go!

164
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,367
Wait, wait, wait.

165
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,452
I know we got off
on the wrong foot before, right?

166
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:17,372
But, you know, I really
think we're gonna get along. Don't you?

167
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:18,957
Swimmingly.

168
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,544
Be seeing you, my friend.

169
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,007
You plonker.

170
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:30,969
You think I don't know a toilet when
I see one? You were gonna flush me...

171
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:33,052
<i>We debated back and forth
'cause we were, you know,</i>

172
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:36,224
<i>We wanted this movie to be very,
to be very British and Aardman.</i>

173
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,119
<i>But we also wanted it to
be very international as well.</i>

174
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:42,105
<i>So there's, we... People seemed to
be confused and vexed</i>

175
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:45,942
<i>when we showed to preview audiences
by words like "plonker,"</i>

176
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,146
<i>and the old "cream cracker."</i>

177
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:52,157
<i>And we, we took it out and we changed it
to a very unconvincing "me old donkey."</i>

178
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,034
<i>- That's right.
- And it didn't really work.</i>

179
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,397
<i>- So, we changed it back.
- Yeah.</i>

180
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:56,846
<i>- And it's much better for it.
- Yeah.</i>

181
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,205
<i>This... the effects in this sequence
are actually stunning.</i>

182
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:01,207
<i>- Yeah, this is one of the...
- So pleased.</i>

183
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:02,917
<i>So pleased.</i>

184
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:04,794
<i>This is one of the big sequences for us.</i>

185
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:05,896
<i>- Isn't it?
- It really is.</i>

186
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,381
<i>We spent, like, lot of money
on this, I guess.</i>

187
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:15,847
Have you seen my dad?

188
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:33,364
<i>Here's a tribute
to</i> Caddyshack, <i>everyone said.</i>

189
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:35,092
<i>- Well...</i>
<i>- Although, I've never seen</i> Caddyshack,

190
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:37,076
<i>so I don't know what they're talking
about, but...</i>

191
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:40,914
<i>We knew we had to deal with the issue
of Roddy being flushed down a loo,</i>

192
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,665
<i>and the rather unpleasant connotations.</i>

193
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,895
<i>So, we thought we'd get it all out
in this one sequence. And we did.</i>

194
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:49,339
<i>So, after this sequence,
Roddy goes into Ratropolis</i>

195
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,817
<i>- and everything's nice and clear.
- Yeah. Yeah. It's the evolution.</i>

196
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,652
<i>It was like the 900-pound gorilla
in the room, wasn't it?</i>

197
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,237
<i>We couldn't get away
without the occasional...</i>

198
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,697
<i>- Yeah. No, it's good to do that.
- Poo joke.</i>

199
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:57,889
<i>Yeah, just the one.</i>

200
00:09:58,348 --> 00:09:59,784
<i>But there was so...
yeah, there was lots of,</i>

201
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:01,786
<i>there was a lot of little ones
along the way, weren't there?</i>

202
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:04,580
<i>But we didn't... Do you remember that
one where he popped up and he looked up,</i>

203
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,314
<i>and there was a big bum
coming towards him?</i>

204
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:08,167
<i>Oh, yes, he, sort of, ended up
going down another pipe</i>

205
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:12,695
<i>and ended up in somebody else's toilet
with a huge bottom bearing down at him.</i>

206
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:14,590
<i>- He swam the other way.
- That was so funny.</i>

207
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,491
<i>- That was great.
- That was so funny, but...</i>

208
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,118
<i>This, this slug.</i>

209
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:22,264
<i>I don't know, it...
Something... It's funny how things...</i>

210
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,225
<i>You're... you'll be, you know,
you're boarding a movie,</i>

211
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,477
<i>and you're, you're testing it,
and you're seeing how it works,</i>

212
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:29,629
<i>and things just jump out at you
that people love.</i>

213
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:32,441
<i>Just love. That you would never
have expected them to love and this...</i>

214
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,135
<i>These slugs somehow struck a chord.</i>

215
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:37,303
<i>Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. It's funny that joke, wasn't it?</i>

216
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:38,614
<i>- 'Cause it was, like...
- It was.</i>

217
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,450
<i>It was dead funny but has nothing to do
with the story, or anything, really.</i>

218
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,452
<i>I mean, actually nothing
to do with the story, yeah.</i>

219
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,519
<i>I mean, I suppose...</i>

220
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,956
<i>it's a good way of saying,
"He's stuck in the sewer."</i>

221
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,666
<i>These little...
He meets these slimy creatures...</i>

222
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,692
<i>We wanted him to be frightened
by the wimpiest,</i>

223
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,086
<i>tiniest creature there is, didn't we?</i>

224
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,779
<i>Yeah. Yeah.
So it kinda works on that level. But...</i>

225
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:56,906
<i>- Didn't really expect to see 'em again.
- No.</i>

226
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,343
<i>- Well, actually, they w...
- Imagine our surprise.</i>

227
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,952
<i>Yeah. It was one, at first, wasn't it?</i>

228
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,680
<i>And then we put these ones in,
'cause we thought,</i>

229
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:05,039
<i>"Let's milk the joke.
So we'll just put a load more in."</i>

230
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,493
<i>- And then...
- It was funny.</i>

231
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:07,861
<i>It gets milked again in a minute,</i>

232
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,753
<i>when that running slug pops up again.</i>

233
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,059
<i>So, we thought,
after this guy, we thought,</i>

234
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:15,376
<i>"We've milked...
that's it, we've milked those slugs."</i>

235
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,361
<i>And it's quite hard,
milking a slug, isn't it?</i>

236
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:19,596
<i>Quite, they've got quite small... teats.</i>

237
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,936
<i>Yeah, we could do...</i>

238
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,749
<i>This was, this was part of our...
It's a good side gag, anyway.</i>

239
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:33,276
<i>That's a good joke, isn't it?
I like a side gag.</i>

240
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,444
But three years?

241
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,237
I'm just-a finish it this morning.

242
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:43,036
<i>The first of the rather silly European
stereotypes</i>

243
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,704
<i>that we have in the film.</i>

244
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:48,333
<i>It's the, the ridiculous,
Italian pavement drawer guy.</i>

245
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,584
<i>Yes.</i>

246
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,062
<i>- And that bits pricey.
- Lovely piece of score there.</i>

247
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,379
<i>This bit here.</i>

248
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:55,566
<i>Yeah, Harry... Yeah, we really wanted to,
sort of, like,</i>

249
00:11:55,590 --> 00:12:00,136
<i>lay on what an amazing place as well...
And what a shock, you know?</i>

250
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,239
<i>'Cause, I think the sequence before
was like, you know,</i>

251
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,973
<i>this is what you'd expect the sewer to be.</i>

252
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:06,857
<i>And then Roddy comes through this,
into this area, and it's just, like,</i>

253
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:10,521
<i>you know,
this is the last thing you'd expect.</i>

254
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:11,772
My smalls!

255
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:13,858
- Is it a bird?
- Is it a plane?

256
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:15,985
<i>That's good, isn't it?
Made a Superman joke.</i>

257
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,278
<i>There's a woman in her...</i>

258
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:18,696
<i>Oh, no, she's gone.</i>

259
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,574
- Face like a fryin' pan.
- Come on, honey.

260
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:22,992
I don't think he speaks English.

261
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:26,621
<i>The actor who voiced the Texan,
a guy called Newell Alexander,</i>

262
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:28,974
<i>went out for dinner with him,</i>

263
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:32,418
<i>and he was telling these wonderful stories
about hanging out with Johnny Cash,</i>

264
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:33,586
<i>and we thought,</i>

265
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:36,482
<i>"What a fantastic link to Johnny Cash
we have in our movie."</i>

266
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:37,382
forever, you know?

267
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:40,176
<i>There were, yeah.
Seven degrees of separation.</i>

268
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,570
You can back away from the truth.

269
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,514
<i>It's funny, actually, 'cause of all
the debates about the English accents,</i>

270
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,683
<i>I couldn't really
understand him very well.</i>

271
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,270
<i>- It's...
- Never mind.</i>

272
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:52,397
- How are you?
- Can't complain.

273
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:56,901
<i>So, this is... I mean, we worked on
this for a couple of years, really,</i>

274
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:59,612
<i>this sequence, didn't we?
We did so many versions of it.</i>

275
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,340
<i>We had, do you remember when we had the...</i>

276
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:03,842
<i>cameo from Nick and Fetcher,
from</i> Chicken Run <i>in, in this sequence?</i>

277
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:04,742
<i>We did, yes.</i>

278
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:06,470
<i>We did, It wasn't very good though,
we took it out.</i>

279
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,264
<i>- Yeah, yeah.
- And, they're great characters,</i>

280
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:11,058
<i>- but we didn't do them justice, really.
- Nah, it didn't work fo... so well.</i>

281
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:13,459
<i>We thought we best, just filling
it with British archetypes,</i>

282
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:16,045
<i>like the old</i> Dixon of Dock Green-<i>style
bobby and...</i>

283
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:22,593
<i>Yeah. Yeah. The insane
burger-flipper-pirate guy.</i>

284
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:23,886
<i>That famous stereotype.</i>

285
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,656
<i>They used to cover
every street corner in England.</i>

286
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,974
<i>Yeah. He's very appropriate.</i>

287
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,726
<i>There's a pub in the background.</i>

288
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,162
<i>But that, look at that fountain,
it was fantastic.</i>

289
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,271
<i>It is. It is, isn't it?</i>

290
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:34,897
<i>This is funny, isn't it?</i>

291
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:37,525
<i>I love it, this idea that,
of frying Roddy's hands.</i>

292
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,527
Shady customer.

293
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,797
<i>It's funny, 'cause when you're,
you see something like that,</i>

294
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,590
<i>you don't really
understand why he's doing it, but.</i>

295
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,199
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- I know where it is!

296
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:47,683
<i>Bit of, it's sort of fun to have
a bit of busyness, isn't it?</i>

297
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:49,954
<i>And here he is.</i>

298
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:53,041
<i>This joke was in quite early, wasn't it?</i>

299
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:55,668
<i>- This joke here.
- It was. It was.</i>

300
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:58,254
<i>It's one of our big,
funny jokes, early on.</i>

301
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:01,215
<i>It's these funny, little characters,</i>

302
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:05,261
<i>like, we had the slug, and the fish,
and this peg leg-guy and tadpoles...</i>

303
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:07,964
<i>They all became more popular,</i>

304
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:11,768
<i>and we, sort of, tried to find ways
to fold them into the film again.</i>

305
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,287
<i>- Yeah.
- Just because we enjoyed them so much.</i>

306
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:15,855
<i>- Yeah. And there they are again.
- Once again, the slugs here.</i>

307
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:16,856
<i>Yeah.</i>

308
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:19,942
<i>Said we wouldn't have 'em,
we thought we'd done with them, but...</i>

309
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:23,047
<i>you know, this, this came much later,
didn't it, really?</i>

310
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:25,365
<i>- It did.
- Much on the sequence for a while.</i>

311
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:27,825
<i>The</i> Jammy Dodger.

312
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:29,076
Hello?

313
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,205
Permission to come aboard?

314
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,083
Ahoy there?

315
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,896
<i>I think I can,
honestly think we managed to...</i>

316
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:01,442
<i>We've got some very, very highbrow humor
in this movie, if you look for it.</i>

317
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,903
<i>And we've got the lowest
of the lowbrow humor, also.</i>

318
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,798
<i>We took, yeah, no,
it's good to have a range, isn't it?</i>

319
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:07,341
<i>- We always like to think.
- It is. It is.</i>

320
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:08,741
Captain Skipper Thingy to you.

321
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:11,025
<i>I think some of
the stuff's highbrow, it's probably not.</i>

322
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:12,703
<i>- No.
- Maybe middlebrow.</i>

323
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:15,123
<i>Yeah, I wouldn't, I don't think we'd
ever get to highbrow.</i>

324
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:17,041
<i>We're not quite highbrow enough, are we?</i>

325
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,043
Yeah, thank you. Too much information.

326
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:20,795
I've got my own problems, mate.

327
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,797
<i>- Kate was fa...
- Kate Winslet.</i>

328
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,341
<i>- God, she's great.
- She rocks, as they say here.</i>

329
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,803
<i>She was, she was so...
I mean, she's very, very funny.</i>

330
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,447
<i>But she was so serious,
and so professional.</i>

331
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:31,305
<i>Yeah.</i>

332
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:33,709
<i>We'd do the se... we'd,
we'd record the sequences with her,</i>

333
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,912
<i>we'd animate them, we'd show
them to her and she'd have suggestions.</i>

334
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:41,357
<i>And they were such good suggestions,
we'd end up taking the scenes and,</i>

335
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,669
<i>you know, she had a better line reading,
we'd do it again.</i>

336
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:44,693
<i>Yeah.</i>

337
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:50,134
<i>- I mean...
- She was great.</i>

338
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:52,052
<i>We were so blessed
to get her for Rita, weren't we?</i>

339
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,245
<i>'Cause she's just my... Rita's like...</i>

340
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:59,292
<i>she's kinda like a really strong,
authentic female character, really.</i>

341
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,376
<i>- She is.
- Yeah.</i>

342
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,062
<i>It's so hard to do that, I guess.
You know?</i>

343
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:05,882
<i>It is, I mean, she really evolved,
as the movie went on, but...</i>

344
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:08,735
<i>well, actually, both Roddy and Rita
started out very different characters.</i>

345
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:09,635
<i>Yeah, they did, yeah.</i>

346
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:12,263
<i>But, I think,
as Roddy changed, we, Rita changed, too.</i>

347
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,973
<i>- Rita was...
- Yeah.</i>

348
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,309
<i>She was a loner when we started,</i>

349
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,561
<i>someone who didn't want
to get close to anybody,</i>

350
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:19,997
<i>because she didn't want to be held back</i>

351
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:24,025
<i>from her dream of sailing off
to see the drains of Europe.</i>

352
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,985
<i>That's right, yeah, a hard-bitten loner.</i>

353
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:29,214
<i>Of course, then we, where we eventually
landed with Rita was the polar opposite.</i>

354
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,156
<i>Yeah.</i>

355
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,520
<i>- So, Spike and Whitey.
- Yeah, it's funny, here's Whitey.</i>

356
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,786
<i>Bill Nighy and Andy Serkis. Yeah.</i>

357
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:37,997
<i>They're the only actors
who got to work together.</i>

358
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,999
<i>Yeah.
Yeah, it was great that day, wasn't it?</i>

359
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,143
<i>- It was.
- They got together</i>

360
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:43,687
<i>ad-libbing about soccer, and football,
and stuff, it was brilliant.</i>

361
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,481
<i>They clicked so beautifully,
as well, they were...</i>

362
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,381
<i>Yeah, no, a very funny pair.</i>

363
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:48,633
<i>- They really were.
- Yeah.</i>

364
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,302
Who have we got here?

365
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:52,428
I believe he said...

366
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,072
<i>I love Laurel and Hardy and I know you do,</i>

367
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:54,931
<i>Yeah.</i>

368
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,617
<i>I think there's an awful lot
of Laurel and Hardy</i>

369
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:58,100
<i>- in Spike and Whitey.
- Yeah. Yeah.</i>

370
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,603
<i>We were brought up
with those Laurel and Hardy films</i>

371
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:01,854
<i>You know.</i>

372
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:05,024
<i>- With the films, not with the people.
- Not with the people.</i>

373
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,585
<i>- Actually, I was...
- Not that old.</i>

374
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:07,777
<i>No.</i>

375
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:10,112
<i>Yeah. But it was great.</i>

376
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,799
<i>I mean, we... for all of the characters
we got reference, didn't we, for them?</i>

377
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,992
<i>And I... we got some clips of,</i>

378
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:19,038
<i>looked at, actually, old,
lot of British movies,</i>

379
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:22,667
<i>like</i> Quadrophenia <i>and
there's a lot of Phil,</i>

380
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,836
<i>the Phil Daniels character
in</i> Quadrophenia, <i>in this.</i>

381
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,923
<i>And for Whitey we looked
at a lot of wardrobes.</i>

382
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,008
<i>Yes. Big wardrobes.</i>

383
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:32,569
<i>Put wardrobes on legs and looked at those.</i>

384
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:33,928
<i>And seen what it was like.</i>

385
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:37,014
<i>It's Danny Green in</i> The Ladykillers,
<i>as well, we looked at him.</i>

386
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:40,351
You get your filthy paws off my stuff.

387
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,105
It's in here somewhere, I can f...

388
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,022
<i>I love all that.</i>

389
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:47,000
<i>I mean, we didn't, I don't know how much
has come through,</i>

390
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:49,026
<i>there's a few lines,
but I love all the backstory,</i>

391
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:52,572
<i>of Spike being like,
'cause he still lives with his mom,</i>

392
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,908
<i>and his middle name's Lesley,
and he's, he's actually like a...</i>

393
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:59,120
<i>he's never,
he's not really a bad guy, you know?</i>

394
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:02,623
<i>He's like, he's just tryin' to be bad,
but he's just basically a sort of,</i>

395
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:08,254
<i>more of a pimply, 16 year-old
tryin' to appear bad and...</i>

396
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:10,885
<i>I can't believe
that Japanese flag joke made it.</i>

397
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:12,818
<i>- It made it, didn't it?
- Yeah. Yeah. It did.</i>

398
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:14,486
<i>- It was in there at the beginning.
- Yeah, yeah.</i>

399
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,363
<i>That's the longest-running jokes,
isn't it, really?</i>

400
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:17,471
<i>Lots of people complained.</i>

401
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:21,183
<i>Yeah. Well, most people, for years,
didn't know, could not</i>

402
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:22,703
<i>quite hear what he was saying, wasn't it?</i>

403
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:23,807
<i>So we'd get away with that.</i>

404
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,271
<i>We'd kind of leave it there.</i>

405
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:28,834
<i>People were like, "Oh, no, no,
it's just some background noise,</i>

406
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:30,378
<i>you don't wanna worry about all that."</i>

407
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,361
You'll be singing like a teakettle.

408
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,238
Good one, Persuader.

409
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:37,033
I don't even know her. I don't know
anything about anything.

410
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:38,701
<i>Yeah. But it's great.</i>

411
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,263
<i>I think that this... I, like it about all
the characters in the film,</i>

412
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,873
<i>is that the, they're,
and even The Toad, actually,</i>

413
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:48,628
<i>is that they've all got a, sort of,
reason for why they're like they are,</i>

414
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:50,731
<i>or they're, you know,
they're sort of actually softer,</i>

415
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:52,691
<i>or you can sort of under...
Sort of feel sorry for him.</i>

416
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:53,900
<i>- Everybody has a sob story.
- Yeah.</i>

417
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:57,803
<i>You sort of feel that they've all got a,
sort of, sympathetic side, or...</i>

418
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,722
<i>- The Henchrats are, I mean...
- Yeah.</i>

419
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,766
<i>The guy on the left
there's Thimblenose Ted.</i>

420
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,935
<i>Tells everybody he lost his nose in a...</i>

421
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,772
<i>Does he say
he lost his nose in a knife fight.</i>

422
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,985
<i>It was actually a lawnmower accident
and... he's a bit embarrassed and...</i>

423
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:11,901
<i>Yeah.</i>

424
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,654
<i>And there's Fat Barry as well,
isn't there? Who's always eating.</i>

425
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:18,240
<i>And Ladykiller, who's a bit
of a ladies' man.</i>

426
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:20,052
<i>- He thinks he is.
- He thinks he is, but he's...</i>

427
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:22,554
<i>Actually, well, if you, he doesn't get
to take his glasses off,</i>

428
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:26,582
<i>but he's got the most silly little
cross-eyes underneath those dark glasses.</i>

429
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:29,085
<i>And he's pretty damn ugly, actually, so.</i>

430
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:31,438
<i>- I love that...
- Whitey's backstory's lovely.</i>

431
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:32,296
<i>Yeah.</i>

432
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,066
<i>See, that, actually,
that's amazing, I think,</i>

433
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,257
<i>that we actually got that...</i>

434
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:38,260
<i>We've, you know,
managed to keep that in the film,</i>

435
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:42,348
<i>just that aside of a secondary character
telling their backstory, you know, it's...</i>

436
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:45,810
<i>The Toad. The Toad used to be The Weasel.</i>

437
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,773
<i>- Oh, God, yeah.
- Remember that, long time ago?</i>

438
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:50,147
<i>Long time ago and Sam and I, we...</i>

439
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:52,167
<i>- It was set in Bristol...
- We didn't like The Weasel much, did we?</i>

440
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,711
<i>Well, we couldn't draw them very well.</i>

441
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:55,903
<i>I could never draw a weasel very well.</i>

442
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,571
<i>We were drawing weasels and...</i>

443
00:19:58,406 --> 00:20:02,618
<i>we just... we came...
it, happened upon the idea of The Toad.</i>

444
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,721
<i>And we wanted him to look a little bit
like Charles Laughton,</i>

445
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:05,746
<i>- And...
- Yeah.</i>

446
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,808
<i>We thought of Noel Coward
in</i> The Italian Job, <i>actually.</i>

447
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:09,432
<i>- Yeah. Yeah.
- It was a collection of...</i>

448
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,019
<i>- Yeah, that was fun, wasn't it?
- It was fun.</i>

449
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,295
<i>Just, just, developing him
and thinking about all the...</i>

450
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:16,382
<i>making this big,
pompous British bloke, you know?</i>

451
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:19,009
<i>Slightly weird and sinister, as well.</i>

452
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:21,446
<i>And a little bit of Sydney Greenstreet,
as well, at one point.</i>

453
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,323
<i>- Little bit of Sydney Greenstreet.
- Yeah. Yeah.</i>

454
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,682
<i>- Or Streep?
- Street.</i>

455
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:25,933
<i>Thank you.</i>

456
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,435
To my father, and you know it.

457
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,019
Your father...

458
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:31,605
<i>Dream casting, as well,
to have Ian McKellen.</i>

459
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:33,858
<i>- His wonderful voice.
- Theatrical.</i>

460
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,401
<i>- Yeah.
- Rich.</i>

461
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:39,196
<i>Yeah. And we spent so long
developing those mouths.</i>

462
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,907
<i>His big, rolling mouth shapes, you know?</i>

463
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:43,868
<i>And it's really quite difficult to do.</i>

464
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,579
<i>And it was a whole technique for,</i>

465
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:49,498
<i>for the DreamWorks people to,
to make a face like this.</i>

466
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:53,377
<i>Well, in fact, all the faces were...
unlike anything they'd done before.</i>

467
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,839
<i>Poor Ian ended up coming in
for so many sessions.</i>

468
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:58,608
<i>But he was very good about it.</i>

469
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:01,260
<i>Yeah, he was a good sport, wasn't he?
Well, they all were, really.</i>

470
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,116
<i>It must be pretty strange for
them when they, 'cause they go,</i>

471
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:10,060
<i>they must go away and forget about...
what the film is, and everything.</i>

472
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:12,205
<i>- And then they get dragged back.
- I think Hugh's done...</i>

473
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:13,856
<i>about... three...</i>

474
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,400
<i>- No.
- I think he's done, like, 39 films.</i>

475
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:19,612
<i>- Yeah.
- That's what it feels like. It feels like.</i>

476
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:22,340
<i>Whenever you see him, he's, like,
got a completely different hairstyle,</i>

477
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:25,701
<i>or, like, he's, or he's covered
in tattoos, or something.</i>

478
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:28,245
<i>It's, "I'm just doin' another film, mate"</i>

479
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:30,372
<i>- Aren't these props great?
- Yes, I love...</i>

480
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:31,725
<i>This whole collection room is...</i>

481
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:33,083
<i>it's one of my favorite parts</i>

482
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:34,811
<i>- of the film, really.
- The thing about CG, yeah.</i>

483
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,605
<i>It's the thing about CG films though,
isn't it?</i>

484
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:37,922
<i>You can't get to keep the props.</i>

485
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,673
<i>You know, like a, like a stop-frame film,</i>

486
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:41,477
<i>you could probably take that home,
you know?</i>

487
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,136
<i>But this is, none of this exists.</i>

488
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,910
<i>I'll make you one out of Plasticine.</i>

489
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,598
<i>- Thanks.
- You're welcome.</i>

490
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:50,851
<i>You could probably buy one.
You could buy that torch.</i>

491
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:52,812
Crown jewel.

492
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:59,902
- Well, whaddya think?
- He's a madman.

493
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:03,364
- Run away. Ru...
- Pardon me, my fly's undone.

494
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:04,740
<i>I do like puns.</i>

495
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,324
<i>Yes.</i>

496
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,745
<i>- A good pun.</i>
- Indeed.

497
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:11,056
<i>That's a nice bit of animation.</i>

498
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,080
How did it ever find m...

499
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,707
<i>Was this Jason Spencer Galsworthy?</i>

500
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:18,587
<i>Yeah. Yeah, he really spent a lot of time
developing The Toad character,</i>

501
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:19,964
<i>and, you know...</i>

502
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:23,008
<i>Just in his acting
and technically, as well.</i>

503
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:25,052
It's very amusing, but I do...

504
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:28,931
<i>So we came up with the concept
of The Toad character, and we, you know,</i>

505
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:32,518
<i>as, the process, as it works out here,
we do, we do outlines and we have script.</i>

506
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:37,565
<i>And then we, we gave the sequence
to our head of story, Paul Fisher,</i>

507
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:41,652
<i>and he really gave The Toad his voice.</i>

508
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,696
<i>- Yeah, he did, didn't he?
- Yeah. He really did.</i>

509
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,823
<i>- Yeah.
- I mean, his way of speaking.</i>

510
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,950
<i>- And...
- Did some really nice writing, didn't he?</i>

511
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,994
<i>- He did some great writing.
- Yeah.</i>

512
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,582
<i>Funny, very talented man.</i>

513
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:58,626
Heaven help me.

514
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:01,213
Ice him. Ice them both.

515
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:04,150
<i>And this was qui...
I think, this is quite early, wasn't it?</i>

516
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:05,174
<i>- When the...
- It was.</i>

517
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,654
<i>The sequence is one
of the first things that got storyboarded.</i>

518
00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:09,972
Former enemies, one and all.

519
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,766
A catalog of thieves,
double-crossers and...

520
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:15,161
<i>This kind of this joke was there right
from the beginning, wasn't it?</i>

521
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:18,480
<i>It's kinda stuck. A lot of this stuff,
you know, hasn't changed.</i>

522
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:20,566
Your maker. Your ice maker.

523
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:22,127
<i>It was a great chance for us to, kind of,</i>

524
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:24,194
<i>write some Spike and Whitey silliness,
wasn't it?</i>

525
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:26,238
<i>- And, kind of get into that.
- It was. We love...</i>

526
00:23:26,697 --> 00:23:29,909
<i>The... quite an obscure reference
to Larry Grayson there</i>

527
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:31,785
<i>for anyone in England who's over 40.</i>

528
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:33,579
<i>Oh, yeah. Shut That Door, yeah.</i>

529
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:36,582
<i>The Larry Grayson tribute joke, yeah.</i>

530
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:39,209
<i>- It goes down well in England.
- Every movie should have one.</i>

531
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:45,966
- Blimey, it's cold.
- That's why I wore me mittens.

532
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:48,385
Hit men don't wear mittens.

533
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:50,149
<i>But I think we
when we did this originally,</i>

534
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,900
<i>this conversation between Spike
and Whitey,</i>

535
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:54,558
<i>- it was just pages and pages.
- It was, wasn't it?</i>

536
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:56,842
<i>- They went on and on.
- They went on about football and</i>

537
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:59,688
<i>at his mom's house
and what his mom thought and...</i>

538
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,106
<i>It could have...</i>

539
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,418
<i>I think one day we'll have to make</i>

540
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:06,403
<i>a Spike and Whitey half hour feature
or something, you know.</i>

541
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:09,490
<i>- At least a half hour.
- If the money's right.</i>

542
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,742
<i>Yeah, well, I wouldn't do it for nothing.</i>

543
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,513
<i>I'll do this one for nothing, okay?</i>

544
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:17,957
<i>But, you know, but not the next one,
though, I tell ya.</i>

545
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,018
<i>We can definitely make some money on that.</i>

546
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:22,044
Goodbye, vermin.

547
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:27,466
<i>So The Toad is a bit,
this is his James Bond lair, really.</i>

548
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,301
<i>'Cause we, we both love James Bond films.</i>

549
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:31,470
<i>Yeah. Yeah. Can't help but be influenced.</i>

550
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:34,807
<i>Yeah. But be that was a great thing
about working in the, kind of,</i>

551
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:39,395
<i>the Aardman world is you can do it
all silly, can't you?</i>

552
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:43,357
The prize returns to me.

553
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:49,321
<i>His big death machine is actually just an
old fridge with some fridge magnets on it.</i>

554
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,370
<i>I love the ice cream cabinet
to the right there</i>

555
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:52,884
<i>- with the laser-lick ice lolly.
- Oh, yeah.</i>

556
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,410
<i>Laser-lick ice lolly.</i>

557
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,286
<i>That's, like, so '70s, isn't it?</i>

558
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:58,747
<i>It's, kind of, you can tell we're both,
like, middle-aged,</i>

559
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:00,475
<i>and were brought up in the '70s.</i>

560
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,751
<i>Speak for yourself. I'm only 24.</i>

561
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:04,545
<i>- Yeah.
- The...</i>

562
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:08,924
<i>Good job you teamed up with me, you young
whippersnapper. Help me keep me current.</i>

563
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:11,260
<i>We were worried
that Spike and Whitey, we...</i>

564
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,886
<i>Were getting very Keystone Cops-y</i>

565
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,823
<i>when they were running around
banging into things.</i>

566
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:18,726
<i>And then we remembered, fortunately,
that we love Keystone Cops. That was okay.</i>

567
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:21,520
<i>- Yes.
- Yeah. I quite like.</i>

568
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:25,733
<i>It's the simple pleasure of just
hitting someone like Spike really hard.</i>

569
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:28,235
<i>- It never, kind of, wears out, does it?
- It doesn't.</i>

570
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:30,838
<i>There's some really great
slapstick coming up as well, actually,</i>

571
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:32,573
<i>which I love to watch.</i>

572
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:35,534
No, no, no don't break.

573
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,828
There are things I want to do,
sights I want to see.

574
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:41,749
- That wasn't on the list.
- Hey!

575
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:46,754
Do something.

576
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:48,839
<i>Here we go.
I just love this stuff with Spike.</i>

577
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,592
<i>We've really worked on making it...</i>

578
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:54,678
<i>that sound sound really painful
with his spine cracking.</i>

579
00:25:55,763 --> 00:25:58,098
Keep your legs straight
when you hit the water.

580
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:03,353
<i>- Ouch.
- Yeah.</i>

581
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:07,483
<i>And again, the great,
great sound design on all this stuff.</i>

582
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,318
<i>These sound effects, brilliant.</i>

583
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:12,071
That's high. Quite high, rather high.
So very, very high.

584
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:15,407
<i>It's funny, this little bit
of a sequence which is quite painful.</i>

585
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:21,038
<i>Not... we don't really like hitting
people in the crotch in animated movies</i>

586
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:23,582
<i>- because it's been done in so many movies.
- Yeah. Yeah.</i>

587
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:27,503
<i>But we came up with
this little sequence just to bridge</i>

588
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:30,923
<i>the story between, you know, what's just
happened and what's just about to happen.</i>

589
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,925
<i>- Yeah.
- I've had a sequence in there that...</i>

590
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,512
<i>we just, between us, we,
we didn't like it,</i>

591
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:39,473
<i>but it ended up with Roddy getting punched
in the crotch.</i>

592
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:41,659
<i>And we couldn't shift the sequence,
could we?</i>

593
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:43,161
<i>'Cause people always responded well to it.</i>

594
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:44,865
<i>So we thought,
"Well, we're gonna do this."</i>

595
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:47,022
<i>If people see Roddy
being hit in the crotch,</i>

596
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:51,568
<i>we'll do the ultimate
Roddy-being hit-in the-crotch sequence.</i>

597
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:53,028
<i>This is the ultimate in nut gags.</i>

598
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:55,030
<i>It should be, like, the final nut gag</i>

599
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:58,117
<i>- in humanity, really. This century.
- It is.</i>

600
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,201
<i>The hammer.</i>

601
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,413
And gently down.

602
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:09,753
One, two, my ball.
It's my ball. It's mine!

603
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,422
Rita. Rita.

604
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:18,428
Where is she? Rita!

605
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:23,350
Target at 12:00 o'clock. Come on.

606
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:28,522
<i>- Move on to the banana gag.
- Let's move on to the banana gag.</i>

607
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:31,608
<i>This one we did,
we kept extending this shot.</i>

608
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:33,986
<i>And re-animating it,
'cause we thought it was so funny</i>

609
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:35,737
<i>the way they were creeping around it.</i>

610
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:39,616
<i>We sent it back to animation about
three times, didn't we? Kept extending it.</i>

611
00:27:40,534 --> 00:27:41,534
<i>Some slugs.</i>

612
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:43,328
<i>- Yeah. This is a surprise.
- That sign.</i>

613
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:44,722
<i>There's a little sign in front of them.</i>

614
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:48,750
<i>- And the joke is quite repulsive.
- Sweet corn, hardly used.</i>

615
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:49,918
<i>Yuck.</i>

616
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:54,756
<i>That's it... I mean, mo...
it's great being out in the city again.</i>

617
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,967
<i>- This model is fantastic, isn't it?
- It really is.</i>

618
00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:00,721
<i>And it's just amazing
how real everything looks, you know?</i>

619
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:03,473
<i>And you, you think that none
of it really exists, you know?</i>

620
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:05,285
<i>You could reach in and touch it,
couldn't you?</i>

621
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:08,187
<i>Yeah, and that's, like, the joy of the,
all the Aardman films, really.</i>

622
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:12,107
<i>It's, they've just got that
lovely sort tactile feel and</i>

623
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,819
<i>we just really didn't want to lose
that by going into the computer.</i>

624
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,239
What are you? Some kind of rat?

625
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:21,408
<i>And I me...
You know, I knew it would be good,</i>

626
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:24,912
<i>but I'm surprised at how good it is,
actually. How good it looks.</i>

627
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:27,914
Okay.

628
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,350
<i>This was one of the first sequences...</i>

629
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,626
<i>- Yeah.
- Boarded.</i>

630
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,229
<i>- Yep.
- And I think that this sequence</i>

631
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:34,129
<i>green-lit our movie because we saw</i>

632
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:39,009
<i>the Roddy-Rita relationship really working
and how they sparked off each other.</i>

633
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:41,595
<i>- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes.
- Pretty early stuff. Yeah.</i>

634
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:43,388
<i>And it's pivotal, isn't it? The deal.</i>

635
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:46,225
<i>And, it's, it's, now,
the story'll move on after this sequence.</i>

636
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,853
<i>But yeah, in...
You know, when we first start,</i>

637
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:51,789
<i>we were talking about</i> The African Queen,
<i>weren't we?</i>

638
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:53,499
<i>Was another one.
This kind of mismatched couple...</i>

639
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:55,484
<i>- We were.
- On this funky old boat.</i>

640
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,986
<i>And she's Humphrey Bogart
and he's Katharine Hepburn.</i>

641
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:02,508
<i>I love the storefronts
in the background, as well.</i>

642
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:03,532
<i>Yeah.</i>

643
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,762
<i>It's funny how he got away...
how he dealt with that in the end.</i>

644
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:07,287
<i>That, that he smashes that ruby,</i>

645
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:10,374
<i>'cause at one point it seemed
like too heavy a thing to do.</i>

646
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:14,127
<i>Like, you, everyone would just fall out
of love with Roddy in that instant.</i>

647
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:15,921
<i>But we found a way that he could do it.</i>

648
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,381
Roddy St. James saves the day.

649
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:20,948
<i>And then we found
a way that she could punch him in the fa...</i>

650
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:22,928
<i>punch him in the face, as well.</i>

651
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:25,180
<i>- And it's all done.
- Yeah.</i>

652
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:26,723
<i>I love the things in this.</i>

653
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:28,701
<i>I love the little things of odds
and sods on the wall.</i>

654
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:31,454
<i>Yeah. And that peg and the ladder.
And this is one of my favorite tracks,</i>

655
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:32,580
<i>- actually.
- Filled with jokes.</i>

656
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,231
And the drains of Buckingham Palace!

657
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:36,942
Well, maybe the queen wears fake jewelry.

658
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,193
Keep still!

659
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:39,897
Can we just talk about this?

660
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:43,657
Real or not, that ruby was gonna change...

661
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,340
<i>We were gonna put in there
but we never got around to building it.</i>

662
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,263
<i>We couldn't fit much more in the budget
in there, really.</i>

663
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:49,496
<i>Yeah.</i>

664
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,331
<i>We had lots of different peo...</i>

665
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:53,017
<i>Different characters on the phone,
didn't we?</i>

666
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,769
<i>- And we tried lots of different things.
- We did.</i>

667
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,980
<i>- It was phone chat lines and...
- Yeah, there were some quiet phones.</i>

668
00:29:57,004 --> 00:29:58,964
<i>Just telephone operator
and someone at the BBC.</i>

669
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,382
<i>Yeah.</i>

670
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:04,678
- Rita?
- Just go away, please.

671
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:09,390
I'm sorry.

672
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,146
- Sorry?
<i>- I love this scene. This deflated Rita.</i>

673
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:14,855
Me and my dad worked these drains...

674
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:16,648
<i>She's so beautifully sensitive,
it's great.</i>

675
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:17,649
<i>Yeah.</i>

676
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:19,693
Every bone in his
body trying to get that ruby.

677
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,528
<i>It's such good vocal performances.</i>

678
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,631
<i>But... and,
and the animation matches it, doesn't it?</i>

679
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:24,698
<i>- For both of them.
- Yeah.</i>

680
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:26,241
<i>- Yeah.
- It's Gromit again.</i>

681
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:27,326
<i>Yeah.</i>

682
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,996
<i>Funny enough,
there's an awful lot of Aardman,</i>

683
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,808
<i>and, you know, a few DreamWorks'
references in the background.</i>

684
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,793
<i>And, really often,
as we were under such tight schedule,</i>

685
00:30:36,877 --> 00:30:40,172
<i>we didn't have time
to design too many props.</i>

686
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:41,298
<i>- So, Gromit...
- Yeah.</i>

687
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:44,676
<i>Or, it was, or, say,
Alex the lion in the little girl's bedroom</i>

688
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,303
<i>was sort of ease, easy to fall into.</i>

689
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:47,613
<i>Well, it's free design, isn't it?</i>

690
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:48,472
<i>- It's all done.
- It is.</i>

691
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:49,639
<i>It looks good.</i>

692
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:54,394
How do I know this ain't
just a load of old rubbish?

693
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:57,314
Well, I suppose you'll just have
to trust me.

694
00:30:57,814 --> 00:30:58,899
<i>And we liked to do it.</i>

695
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:00,626
<i>Yeah, we worked on this one
a lot, didn't we?</i>

696
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:01,943
<i>- The sequence...
- We did.</i>

697
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:04,529
<i>Just getting this
balance right between the two of them.</i>

698
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:06,907
<i>And then she spits in her hand,
doesn't she?</i>

699
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:10,786
<i>And, at one point, we had this really
great, big lump of green spit.</i>

700
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:14,539
<i>It was. It was like a small palm of jelly.</i>

701
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:17,584
<i>Yeah. But then the...</i>

702
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:21,004
<i>Kids loved it,
but their moms didn't, did they?</i>

703
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:23,006
<i>- No.
- People's mothers didn't like that.</i>

704
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:25,050
<i>So, we had to tone it down a little bit.</i>

705
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:27,844
Where are those idiots?

706
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:30,389
<i>"Sands of time whisper
through my flippers."</i>

707
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:32,265
<i>It's an old line, isn't it?</i>

708
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:34,184
Come on out, my love...

709
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:35,644
<i>This is just like...</i>

710
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:38,814
Poor Daddy.

711
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:43,777
Surrounded by filthy rats
in this joyless, sunless void.

712
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,654
<i>I love this piece of animation on this.</i>

713
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,697
<i>And the vocal performance is great.</i>

714
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:50,409
We will get rid of them all. He will.

715
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:52,744
They're all be deady weddy.

716
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:56,248
<i>Ian was so up for anything, as well.</i>

717
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:57,165
<i>- So...
- Yeah.</i>

718
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:58,851
<i>He's quite worried about his stuff,
because...</i>

719
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:00,585
<i>He's a classy actor, isn't he?</i>

720
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:02,712
<i>- Yes.
And he'll do anything, anything, you...</i>

721
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:04,756
<i>You expect him to go,
"What is this rubbish?"</i>

722
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,467
<i>And throw all the pages across the...</i>

723
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:10,262
<i>"Come back when you've got
something decent."</i>

724
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,638
<i>But no, he will...</i>

725
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:13,890
Richard III.<i> The sequel</i> Richard IV.

726
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:14,850
<i>Yeah.</i>

727
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,245
<i>But, no, he'll do anything
to accommodate you, wouldn't he?</i>

728
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:18,812
<i>- He's a good comedian and...
- He was.</i>

729
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:20,439
<i>- He's great.
- Yeah.</i>

730
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:21,857
The ruby's gone.

731
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,293
<i>Now this is the, this was the first thing
we ever animated, actually.</i>

732
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:25,777
<i>The first sequence we animated.</i>

733
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:27,446
<i>And it was just a small one,</i>

734
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:30,282
<i>and I don't think we'd quite got
all of the characters up and ready.</i>

735
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:32,075
<i>We just had these three characters.</i>

736
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:36,246
<i>And I never forget when it first came,</i>

737
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:39,166
<i>started coming back through lighting,
just how good it looked is...</i>

738
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:40,375
<i>- It's incredible.
- Yeah.</i>

739
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:43,128
<i>We just knew that we, we got it solved.</i>

740
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:44,480
With all those goons on our tail.

741
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,381
<i>This is a funny one, isn't it?
Now this one...</i>

742
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:49,050
<i>This is, this was ver, this was
a very late breaking sequence.</i>

743
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:50,302
<i>- And...
- Gosh.</i>

744
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:54,055
<i>We did a hundred
versions of this sequence before this one.</i>

745
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:58,477
<i>They visited Chinatown to see Charlie Wu,
who was a very funny character.</i>

746
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:02,355
<i>They went to a garage that was run
by an insane budgerigar.</i>

747
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:05,126
<i>- They went to a pub.
- They went to, they went to a pub to see</i>

748
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:08,695
<i>the insane socket set
that the carriage mechanic.</i>

749
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:11,007
<i>The carriage mechanic guy,
who was gonna fix up the</i> Jammy Dodger

750
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:13,617
<i>so Rita could sail to the...
see the drains of Europe.</i>

751
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:16,661
<i>But then, the idea of Rita's family</i>

752
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:18,848
<i>had been sort of hovering
peripherally for a long time.</i>

753
00:33:18,872 --> 00:33:20,081
<i>- Yeah, yeah.
- And it...</i>

754
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:22,792
<i>It just seemed so delicious
when we started to really consider it.</i>

755
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:23,710
<i>Yeah.</i>

756
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:26,189
<i>There's lots of, lots of funny stuff
in the background there.</i>

757
00:33:26,213 --> 00:33:29,049
<i>It's... I love, this is the most
Aardman-looking</i>

758
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,776
<i>- of all the sequences we've done.
- Yeah, I think so.</i>

759
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,970
<i>Well it's, I mean, the great thing
is it's a chance to get into an interior.</i>

760
00:33:34,054 --> 00:33:36,723
<i>And really, kind of,
see the kind of detail and warmth</i>

761
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:39,309
<i>that inside this great world down there,
as well.</i>

762
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:41,937
<i>And we didn't have that
anywhere else in the film,</i>

763
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,105
<i>a chance to go in into an interior.</i>

764
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:46,816
<i>But I love all the kitsch,
sort of, detail.</i>

765
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:50,320
<i>Very working class, British houses,
you know?</i>

766
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:52,572
<i>Sort of, set, it's kind of '70s looking.</i>

767
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:55,367
<i>There's some great
family photographs on the wall.</i>

768
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:57,744
He's very good-looking.

769
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:59,913
He is not coming in.

770
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:02,624
Soup's on.

771
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:06,086
It's lovely, thanks, mom.

772
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:07,730
<i>I love their wedding picture
if you can see it.</i>

773
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:08,754
<i>Yeah.</i>

774
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:12,008
<i>- And then...
- Very lucky with the actors here as well.</i>

775
00:34:12,092 --> 00:34:14,761
<i>- David Suchet, Kathy Burke as mom and dad.
- Yeah.</i>

776
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:16,596
<i>And Miriam Margolyes is granny.</i>

777
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,680
<i>Granny, yeah.</i>

778
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,057
<i>She's superb, yeah.</i>

779
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,476
Are you going to
make an honest woman of my daughter?

780
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,686
Dad.

781
00:34:22,936 --> 00:34:23,936
<i>So warm.</i>

782
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,314
<i>Yeah, he was wonderful.</i>

783
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:28,775
Look, I just want all of you to know,
he's...

784
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:31,027
Tom Jones!

785
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:32,320
<i>But it's nice that</i>

786
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:35,240
<i>we could just make her whole
family like really eccentric, you know?</i>

787
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:37,885
<i>Like, early on I was a bit worried
that her whole family sequence,</i>

788
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:40,120
<i>it might get a bit mawkish
and kind of, you know...</i>

789
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:41,037
<i>Too sentimental.</i>

790
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:42,281
<i>Too sentimental and too nice.</i>

791
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,599
<i>- Or even dark, actually.
- Yeah.</i>

792
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:44,976
<i>- It got dark at one point.
- Yeah.</i>

793
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,628
<i>Like a bit, "Poverty. The poor family."</i>

794
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:51,673
<i>You know, like a Dickensian version.</i>

795
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:54,860
<i>But, I'm really pleased the way
this turned out. It's just fun, isn't it?</i>

796
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:57,012
<i>- You know, you can see...
- It is just fun.</i>

797
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,455
<i>- It's quite real, as well.
- Yeah.</i>

798
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:01,016
Kitchen. Now.

799
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,642
<i>Got any money, but...</i>

800
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:03,768
Sing us a song.

801
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:04,894
<i>They're not miserable.</i>

802
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:07,105
<i>- They're poor, but they're happy.
- Poor but happy.</i>

803
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:09,899
<i>- Didn't need fun when I was...
- Yeah.</i>

804
00:35:09,983 --> 00:35:12,444
No one's ever got
past the rapids at Hyde Park.

805
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,005
- Once the currents get you.
- Dad, Dad, Dad.

806
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:15,965
<i>- There it is.
- And it's just nice to look at all the,</i>

807
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:18,241
<i>kind of, little detail in the props
and stuff, isn't it?</i>

808
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:19,618
<i>Stuff going on.</i>

809
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:21,077
<i>- The cockroach.
- Rita's...</i>

810
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,874
<i>Rita's dad has lots of production
babies' names all over his cast.</i>

811
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,935
<i>But that cockroach is probably
about as highbrow as we get.</i>

812
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:31,588
<i>Which is a cockroach
reading</i> Kafka's Metamorphosis <i>in French.</i>

813
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:32,756
<i>Yes!</i>

814
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:36,843
<i>It's one for the critics,
that, you know, we hope.</i>

815
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:39,304
<i>This one, on the other hand,
is a bit more,</i>

816
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:41,598
<i>a bit lower-brow, further down the scale.</i>

817
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:44,934
<i>Hugh just riffed on this Tom Jones
stuff, and it's great, he's...</i>

818
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:46,138
<i>Well, he can sing, can't he?</i>

819
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:48,414
<i>- He can sing beautifully.
- That's the brilliant thing, you know.</i>

820
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:49,718
<i>Just like, you get that as well.</i>

821
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:52,692
- I love you, Tom.
- This bloke isn't who he says he is.

822
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:53,777
His real name...

823
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,879
<i>Now, this is kind of the whole,</i>

824
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:56,422
<i>this is the thing we always had
in this scene.</i>

825
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:57,906
<i>In what, whatever version,</i>

826
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:03,370
<i>we always wanted Roddy to think that
Rita was, you know, double-crossing him.</i>

827
00:36:03,453 --> 00:36:05,622
<i>Because we really wanted
to get to the next scene</i>

828
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:07,290
<i>where Roddy's stolen the boat,</i>

829
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:08,958
<i>which we'd, we'd already storyboard</i>

830
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:12,087
<i>and we loved it so much we'd
already put it into production, didn't we?</i>

831
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,046
<i>We were like...</i>

832
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:14,047
You're from up top?

833
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,566
<i>You know, it's funny how that goes,
isn't it?</i>

834
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,068
<i>You, kind of, put something in production,</i>

835
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:18,653
<i>and then you, kind of,
other things around it,</i>

836
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:20,477
<i>you're not, you know,
you're still working on.</i>

837
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:21,346
Terribly lonely.

838
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:23,157
<i>This is the
emotional heart of the movie, isn't it?</i>

839
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:28,395
<i>Yeah. And Harry's music on this level,
well, on all levels is great.</i>

840
00:36:28,478 --> 00:36:29,813
<i>But, no, I love the way he...</i>

841
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:35,068
<i>You know, delivers the emotional
core of the film, as well as the actors.</i>

842
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:39,948
- Please. Permit me.
- You're such a gentleman.

843
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,783
<i>A little kid walking on the ceiling</i>

844
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,576
<i>with some rubber suckers
in the background.</i>

845
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,788
The Toad and claim the reward,

846
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:49,874
then we're all sitting pretty
for the rest of our lives.

847
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:53,962
<i>So, yeah. This is pretty much
the last thing that went through lighting.</i>

848
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,714
<i>This sequence, you know?</i>

849
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:59,008
<i>So, you know, it's amazing
when you do it all out of order.</i>

850
00:36:59,092 --> 00:37:02,387
- Acting the rat.
- We, Malones, never go back on our word.

851
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,889
- He's gonna steal your boat.
- He won't steal my boat.

852
00:37:04,973 --> 00:37:06,099
He's stealing your boat.

853
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:08,601
- He isn't stealing my...
- He stole your boat.

854
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:11,813
- What?
- He's like Robin Hood, in reverse.

855
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:15,900
I thought we had a deal?

856
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:19,237
<i>It's funny. There's not many kids,
there's actually one little kid.</i>

857
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,573
<i>There's only, you know,
about four kid models,</i>

858
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:23,700
<i>but they've all been resurfaced
and recolored,</i>

859
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:25,285
<i>different color, different ways.</i>

860
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:27,430
<i>You know, and they actually look,
you know, they don't,</i>

861
00:37:27,454 --> 00:37:29,473
<i>they don't look like
just the same one, really, do they?</i>

862
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:31,058
<i>They don't.
I think they're very individual.</i>

863
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,208
<i>Yeah.</i>

864
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:34,478
<i>That little girl
has always got a finger in her nose.</i>

865
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:37,464
<i>Yeah, this one was picking her nose.
And Shocky is, isn't he?</i>

866
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:38,882
Double-crossing, little schemer.

867
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:42,635
<i>There's some guys fishing there
on the little paper boats. Which is nice.</i>

868
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:46,085
<i>We dropped the wing mirror off
in that scene, because we,</i>

869
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:48,117
<i>the wing mirror was causing us
no end of problems.</i>

870
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:49,535
<i>It was getting in the way of composition.</i>

871
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:50,953
<i>We had to show the reflection every time.</i>

872
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:53,956
<i>Yeah, in lighting, in terms of lighting,
you had to render a whole new scene</i>

873
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,690
<i>in the mirror or something.</i>

874
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:56,816
<i>So, we knocked it off.</i>

875
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,526
<i>- We knocked it off.
- Yeah.</i>

876
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:01,780
<i>It's the lighting department
were thankful for that one. I... you know.</i>

877
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:03,215
If you're still there when I get back...

878
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:05,533
<i>One of the few compromises
we made, really.</i>

879
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:06,951
<i>You know, most, mostly we just,</i>

880
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:09,513
<i>they just did everything
we wanted them to, didn't they, really?</i>

881
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:10,830
<i>- They did.
- Gotta go, Rodders.</i>

882
00:38:10,914 --> 00:38:11,932
<i>If I find one thing out of...</i>

883
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,267
<i>That was funny, that scene, wasn't it?</i>

884
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,293
<i>Because Sid used to have
a dressing gown on,</i>

885
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:17,629
<i>but no one recognized him
when he came on screen.</i>

886
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:19,273
<i>He was dressed like Ray Winstone
in</i> Sexy Beast.

887
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,382
<i>He had a bathrobe on and a pair of...</i>

888
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:23,927
<i>- Speedos.
- Some Union Jack speedos.</i>

889
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:28,515
<i>- But it was half funny, half creepy.
- But yeah, it came on and people...</i>

890
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:32,143
<i>And, yeah, the other half,
and another half puzzling as well.</i>

891
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:34,229
<i>- Some more slugs.
- Look, more slugs.</i>

892
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:35,831
<i>Here's a little song I wrote</i>

893
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:37,732
<i>- Who knew they could sing?
- They're so cute.</i>

894
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:39,359
<i>- They're fantastic.
- Yeah.</i>

895
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:40,652
<i>For note don't worry</i>

896
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:42,403
<i>You can't resist them, can you really?</i>

897
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:45,782
<i>It's like something
we'll have to be weaned off, you know?</i>

898
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:47,784
<i>It's a...</i>

899
00:38:49,786 --> 00:38:52,264
<i>It's fun though, I mean, it's fun to show
a low moment, whether,</i>

900
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:55,291
<i>in a humorous way, isn't it?
It's kind of good to do that.</i>

901
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:57,377
<i>- Yes.
- I love these rats. It's...</i>

902
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:02,674
<i>This tiny little sequence
is nothing but, it's just lunacy.</i>

903
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,676
<i>- Yeah.
- Nothing but silly jokes.</i>

904
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:05,760
<i>Silly stuff.</i>

905
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:08,096
<i>They've got a map of New Zealand, and...</i>

906
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:10,366
<i>- And the biological diagram...
- The anatomy of a squirrel.</i>

907
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:12,058
<i>Of a squirrel behind them.</i>

908
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:14,394
<i>This is where they've
been looking for Roddy and Rita.</i>

909
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:20,316
<i>Nice to, kind of, like,
top it with just a tribute</i> of Batman.

910
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,986
<i>Back down into this lovely set again.</i>

911
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:27,407
Our procedure has...
fairly major burn to the hand there.

912
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:28,616
Smell of burning flesh.

913
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,177
<i>And it's funny that,
kinda, just by chance,</i>

914
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:33,788
<i>we ended up with 5,000 volts
picture behind him at the time, you know?</i>

915
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:35,307
<i>Because when you're shooting this stuff,</i>

916
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:37,500
<i>it's all grey when
you're framing the shots.</i>

917
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:40,229
<i>Because we just have the basic models
in without the surfaces,</i>

918
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:41,087
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

919
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,148
<i>So you're never quite sure what you're
gonna end up with.</i>

920
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:45,818
<i>Yeah, it's always a little surprise
and I was really pleased that you got,</i>

921
00:39:45,842 --> 00:39:48,344
<i>you got that sort
of danger voltage behind him.</i>

922
00:39:48,428 --> 00:39:50,430
That conniving, little toe rag.

923
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:54,058
<i>That's one of my favorite lines
for an old episode of The Bill.</i>

924
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:57,812
<i>Yeah. I think it's Inspector Burnside.</i>

925
00:39:57,896 --> 00:40:00,273
<i>"You evil, two-faced,
conniving, little toe rag."</i>

926
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:02,275
<i>Yeah, it's a classic tribute.</i>

927
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:05,278
You and your family were gonna
sell me to The Toad.

928
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:08,406
What? You dipstick!

929
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:10,533
<i>That was my stupid little brother's plan.</i>

930
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:12,994
<i>That gorgeous ending. Yeah. Wonderful.</i>

931
00:40:14,704 --> 00:40:17,344
- Must've missed that part.
- How could you think I'd sell you out?

932
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:20,835
When I make a deal, I make a deal.

933
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,046
Your hair's on fire.

934
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:24,379
What?

935
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:28,967
Rita, look.

936
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:30,678
I'm sorry, all right?

937
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:34,015
I was wrong and I think we
should just, just put it behind us.

938
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,994
<i>Remember we decided to set fire to
his hair quite late, as well, didn't we?</i>

939
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:38,871
<i>Yeah, at the end.
We'd actually done the scene, yeah.</i>

940
00:40:38,895 --> 00:40:41,272
<i>Done the scene and the effects guys jumped
in and just...</i>

941
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:42,857
<i>Yeah. Yeah.</i>

942
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:44,859
<i>Just came through for us.</i>

943
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:48,321
<i>Yeah, that's the nice thing about CG
compared to stop frame, actually,</i>

944
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:51,366
<i>that you can jump back in
and do things like that.</i>

945
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:52,659
<i>It's a blessing and a curse.</i>

946
00:40:52,742 --> 00:40:56,496
<i>Yeah. Yeah, you never fini...
it never finishes in CGI.</i>

947
00:40:56,829 --> 00:41:00,041
<i>Have to drag you away, 'cause,
it's one more little tweak.</i>

948
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:02,394
<i>Pry your hands off the computer console.</i>

949
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:03,503
<i>Yes.</i>

950
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:06,148
<i>- Yeah.
- Just one more note. One more change.</i>

951
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:07,006
<i>No.</i>

952
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:09,371
<i>Eventually they're gonna
just lock us out of the building,</i>

953
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:11,094
<i>once we finish this commentary.</i>

954
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:15,848
Look, if you're trying to teach me a
lesson consider it taught. I'm on a duck.

955
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:17,034
<i>And this was fun, wasn't it?</i>

956
00:41:17,058 --> 00:41:18,559
<i>- 'Cause I...
- It was.</i>

957
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:31,656
<i>Ice cold Rita</i>

958
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:36,661
<i>Never did I meet a girl
Who's half so cruel</i>

959
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,663
<i>I offered her a jewel</i>

960
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,915
<i>But she left me stuck, stranded on a duck</i>

961
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:44,168
<i>What a shoddy thing to do to Roddy</i>

962
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:45,378
<i>Me.</i>

963
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:47,630
<i>That's Roddy St. James of Kensington</i>

964
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:48,715
<i>Poor, poor...</i>

965
00:41:48,798 --> 00:41:49,882
<i>And here they are.</i>

966
00:41:49,966 --> 00:41:52,385
<i>And this is great, this bit.
And I love this. So funny.</i>

967
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:56,389
<i>Rita can't you find it in your heart</i>

968
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:58,224
<i>To help him</i>

969
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:00,268
<i>- What a lovely, deep voice.
- Yeah.</i>

970
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:03,062
<i>Could one rat be? Ice cold Ri...</i>

971
00:42:03,146 --> 00:42:06,357
<i>It's weird, as it went on you kinda wanted
to do more and more music, didn't you?</i>

972
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:08,794
<i>- 'Cause it's so, it's fun to do, you know?
- That's what we did.</i>

973
00:42:08,818 --> 00:42:10,546
<i>- And yeah, that's why we've done it.
- We did.</i>

974
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:12,131
<i>We spent,
we spent a lot of time towards the end</i>

975
00:42:12,155 --> 00:42:14,866
<i>tryin' to figure out how to get
more music in because it's...</i>

976
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:17,994
<i>It'd be great to do a full blown musical,
wouldn't it, one day?</i>

977
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:20,288
Rita, I wasn't eavesdropping, I swear.

978
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:22,433
<i>- All right.
- It's not so hard in the sto... you know.</i>

979
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:24,375
<i>- Let's do it.
- Yeah, let's do it.</i>

980
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:26,377
<i>You know, could get a simple story.</i>

981
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:29,964
<i>You haven't gotta, like, think about it
too much and just do loads of good songs.</i>

982
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,151
<i>Story of a young guy
from the north of England</i>

983
00:42:32,175 --> 00:42:34,343
<i>who goes to animation college and...</i>

984
00:42:35,011 --> 00:42:36,429
David Bowers The Musical.

985
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:40,266
<i>Fantastic. You'd have to
get someone else to play you...</i>

986
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:42,894
<i>- Get Hugh Jackman.
- Hugh Jackman.</i>

987
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:45,372
<i>- Hugh Jackman as David Bowers.
- He's not good-looking enough.</i>

988
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:46,564
Lucky.

989
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:47,647
<i>Who will play me?</i>

990
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:50,401
<i>Kathy Burke.</i>

991
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:52,320
<i>Kathy Burke is Sam Fell.</i>

992
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:55,323
<i>More of the spitting.</i>

993
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:59,509
<i>And this is kinda, like, you know,
seems significant, doesn't it?</i>

994
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:02,663
<i>Roddy, now Roddy, sort of, leads the way
and he does the first spit.</i>

995
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:05,041
<i>And he's more,
he's more relaxed now, isn't he?</i>

996
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:07,502
<i>He's like a,
his buttoned-up costume is all gone,</i>

997
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,354
<i>- and he's scruffy.
- He's not worried about his hair.</i>

998
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:12,006
<i>And he's more, he's more
tousled hair and everything, you know?</i>

999
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:13,233
<i>He's seeing another side to life.</i>

1000
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:14,842
<i>He's beginning, to fit in and all.</i>

1001
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:17,595
<i>Yeah, it was quite a job to, kind of,
track him through the film</i>

1002
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:19,472
<i>and the animation and everything.</i>

1003
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:24,227
<i>Just to make his, kind of,
journey, sort of, happen</i>

1004
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:27,355
<i>without hitting people over the head
with it, you know?</i>

1005
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,083
<i>'Cause something, sort of tempted,
didn't it?</i>

1006
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:30,942
<i>To write something
that sounds really, like,</i>

1007
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:34,028
<i>just to let everybody know
where Roddy is in his journey.</i>

1008
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:37,198
<i>But, but I'm glad that we kept it
more subtle, really.</i>

1009
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:40,201
Rita!

1010
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:43,121
<i>These blenderjet ski's are genius,</i>

1011
00:43:43,204 --> 00:43:45,706
<i>- and, they are such, such a good idea.
- They're fantastic.</i>

1012
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,040
Now!

1013
00:43:48,835 --> 00:43:49,919
Come and have a go.

1014
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:52,630
<i>This sequence
took about a year from beginning to end.</i>

1015
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:54,799
<i>Yeah. At least. At least, I think.</i>

1016
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:57,510
<i>You know, 'cause with the additions
and lighting and stuff.</i>

1017
00:43:57,885 --> 00:44:00,972
<i>There was a real chance to,
kind of, open up this whole world,</i>

1018
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:01,973
<i>wasn't there, you know?</i>

1019
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:04,851
<i>And we wouldn't, we'd struggle with
something like this in stop frame.</i>

1020
00:44:04,934 --> 00:44:07,311
<i>- We'd really struggle to do this.
- Not enough plasticine.</i>

1021
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:12,150
<i>Yeah, just the, it's just the whole scope
of it, you know?</i>

1022
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:13,901
<i>We'd had to have a wedding in there</i>

1023
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:15,712
<i>because it's a staple
of the James Bond films.</i>

1024
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:18,090
<i>- Yeah, you've got a drive-thru wedding.
- If you look in the background,</i>

1025
00:44:18,114 --> 00:44:20,384
<i>- It's Chinatown, though.
- You see Chinatown, which is, you know,</i>

1026
00:44:20,408 --> 00:44:22,761
<i>we built it for when Rita and Roddy
were going to Chinatown,</i>

1027
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:23,785
<i>- and...
- Yeah.</i>

1028
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:26,890
<i>So we just crammed all our old unused bits
and pieces into the scenes.</i>

1029
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:27,790
<i>Yeah. Yeah.</i>

1030
00:44:27,874 --> 00:44:30,042
<i>So that little moment was, yeah,
the result of...</i>

1031
00:44:30,126 --> 00:44:31,335
<i>Makes it feel very rich.</i>

1032
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:34,088
<i>Yeah. And all the signage, as well.</i>

1033
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:37,717
<i>Like all of these road signs pointing
different places, they're all silly names.</i>

1034
00:44:37,884 --> 00:44:40,970
<i>The silly, kind of,
sewer-related London names.</i>

1035
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:43,399
<i>There's a lot to freeze frame
in this movie.</i>

1036
00:44:43,431 --> 00:44:45,766
<i>Yeah. Yeah.
There's also a lot of gags and stuff.</i>

1037
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:48,519
<i>There's that policeman
from that previous sequence.</i>

1038
00:44:49,896 --> 00:44:51,874
<i>Couldn't afford another one,
so we rented him out again.</i>

1039
00:44:51,898 --> 00:44:53,375
<i>That's another silly, European stereotype.</i>

1040
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:55,610
<i>Oh yeah. The Ita... Yeah. I know, yeah.</i>

1041
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:57,778
<i>The suave Italian stereotype.</i>

1042
00:44:57,862 --> 00:44:59,113
- Take a right.
- What?

1043
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:00,364
Just trust me.

1044
00:45:00,448 --> 00:45:01,574
I hope you know what...

1045
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:03,868
<i>And this is
a chance for Roddy to do something...</i>

1046
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:06,120
<i>Like, this... we picked this moment,
didn't we,</i>

1047
00:45:06,204 --> 00:45:08,956
<i>to kind of have Roddy
use his initiative a bit</i>

1048
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,460
<i>and start to get a bit more
of a handle on things down there.</i>

1049
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:13,543
<i>Yeah.</i>

1050
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:18,966
<i>- Lovely sound effect.
Yeah, I love that.</i>

1051
00:45:20,301 --> 00:45:23,179
<i>- I love Thimblenose Ted's voice,
- Yeah.</i>

1052
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:24,639
<i>- Chris Fairbank's and...
- Yeah.</i>

1053
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:26,557
<i>Such a lovely deep voice.</i>

1054
00:45:26,766 --> 00:45:28,326
<i>It's funny, he lost his thimble, there.</i>

1055
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:29,703
<i>And we were toying with him coming back,</i>

1056
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,246
<i>in the next scene,
with a different thimble.</i>

1057
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:32,980
<i>Like an old lady's thimble.</i>

1058
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:35,125
<i>- With a flower on it, or something.
- Little porcelain one.</i>

1059
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:37,485
<i>Little porcelain one. But we didn't.</i>

1060
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:39,425
<i>We thought it might just look weird.</i>

1061
00:45:39,487 --> 00:45:42,573
<i>We thought, you know,
you might not remember what had happened.</i>

1062
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:44,367
<i>Here's Spike's middle name mentioned.</i>

1063
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:46,827
Danger is my middle name.

1064
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:48,537
I thought it was Lesley.

1065
00:45:49,956 --> 00:45:51,457
<i>Anyways, I love all this.</i>

1066
00:45:56,045 --> 00:45:57,588
<i>And then, like, in an earlier version,</i>

1067
00:45:57,672 --> 00:45:59,358
<i>we had him fly off a boat
and land in some honey.</i>

1068
00:45:59,382 --> 00:46:03,386
<i>And then in some, he landed in a,
in a honey works</i>

1069
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:05,763
<i>and then into a pillow factory, didn't he?</i>

1070
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:06,846
<i>He did.</i>

1071
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:10,142
<i>Kind offended up tarred and feathered.</i>

1072
00:46:10,685 --> 00:46:13,729
<i>But, in the end, I think we just went
with a brutal, kind of, bashing.</i>

1073
00:46:13,813 --> 00:46:14,647
<i>In the dirt.</i>

1074
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:18,526
<i>Carried on with the bashing
the head and nuts theme.</i>

1075
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:19,902
Last requests?

1076
00:46:19,986 --> 00:46:23,155
Yes, yes. Could you fly, quite suddenly,
off the boat, screaming like a girl?

1077
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:24,323
What?

1078
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:34,417
<i>These sound effects hurt, don't they?</i>

1079
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:36,793
<i>They do.</i>

1080
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:41,340
<i>And there's Steve driving the remote
control boat. That little plastic man.</i>

1081
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:43,902
<i>And there was a model shoot,
and there was a design shoot</i>

1082
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:48,222
<i>of about 30 different versions
of Steve to pick from.</i>

1083
00:46:48,973 --> 00:46:51,183
<i>We picked the coolest, suavest Steve.</i>

1084
00:46:51,267 --> 00:46:53,769
<i>This moment is fabulous, isn't it?
I just love this.</i>

1085
00:46:53,853 --> 00:46:57,398
<i>And we had this in a very early version
and we, we didn't use it.</i>

1086
00:46:57,481 --> 00:47:00,377
<i>And then, in the end, we just folded it
back in 'cause it worked so well...</i>

1087
00:47:00,401 --> 00:47:04,238
<i>Strange, during the story process,
things fall away, really good things.</i>

1088
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:05,448
<i>- And we...
- Yeah.</i>

1089
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:07,718
<i>You know, we went back and we looked,
towards the end of the movie,</i>

1090
00:47:07,742 --> 00:47:09,678
<i>which great jokes
have we lost that we really loved?</i>

1091
00:47:09,702 --> 00:47:11,221
<i>- Yeah.
- And we started putting them back in.</i>

1092
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:12,764
<i>That was one of the great jokes,
wasn't it?</i>

1093
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:14,123
<i>Bob Buschetty, I think.</i>

1094
00:47:14,332 --> 00:47:16,167
- Annoyed with us.
- You incompetent...

1095
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:20,212
<i>So now we come to the introduction
of Le Frog, you know?</i>

1096
00:47:20,296 --> 00:47:22,131
<i>- Yeah.
- Le Frog was interesting.</i>

1097
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:25,468
<i>We started to... When we, when
we conceived the character, we thought,</i>

1098
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:27,404
<i>we thought we'd go the traditional route</i>

1099
00:47:27,428 --> 00:47:32,391
<i>of having a British comedian play a silly,
do a silly French accent and...</i>

1100
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:35,569
<i>but then we started to, sort of,
think, you know, if we get Jean Reno.</i>

1101
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:38,647
<i>If... Which we though was
a bit of a slim chance...</i>

1102
00:47:38,731 --> 00:47:39,899
<i>Unlikely, yeah.</i>

1103
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:41,626
<i>So, we thought,
"Well, we've got these pages,</i>

1104
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:43,420
<i>and they're full of these terrible
French jokes..."</i>

1105
00:47:43,444 --> 00:47:46,030
<i>So I remember saying to people at casting,</i>

1106
00:47:46,489 --> 00:47:47,929
<i>"Can you let me have the pages back?</i>

1107
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:49,676
<i>I'll rewrite them before you send them
out to Jean,</i>

1108
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,020
<i>'cause I don't wanna offend him."</i>

1109
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:53,579
<i>- No, they've already gone.
- Yeah, yeah, off they went.</i>

1110
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:54,663
<i>Off they go.</i>

1111
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:56,290
<i>He's cool, though, isn't he?</i>

1112
00:47:56,374 --> 00:47:57,476
<i>So... he was very cool with it.</i>

1113
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:58,626
<i>He pointed out that it's...</i>

1114
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:01,462
<i>Le Frog is really the only really cool
character in the movie.</i>

1115
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:03,130
<i>Yeah. No, he is cool.</i>

1116
00:48:03,214 --> 00:48:07,718
<i>I love his just, beautiful, deep voice
coming out of that silly little character.</i>

1117
00:48:07,802 --> 00:48:09,970
<i>I just think it's such
a great combination.</i>

1118
00:48:10,054 --> 00:48:11,347
Don't worry. I'll get it...

1119
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:12,681
<i>Kinda moved it on, hasn't it?</i>

1120
00:48:12,765 --> 00:48:14,392
<i>- It has.
- In its way.</i>

1121
00:48:14,475 --> 00:48:17,645
<i>And, I think, as well,
having Jean as a fabulous actor</i>

1122
00:48:18,521 --> 00:48:20,041
<i>play the character made it believable.</i>

1123
00:48:20,106 --> 00:48:21,124
<i>- I think if we'd done...
- Yeah.</i>

1124
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:24,110
<i>I think if we'd gone for just a comedian
playing a silly accent,</i>

1125
00:48:24,193 --> 00:48:25,569
<i>- it wouldn't have been...
- Yeah.</i>

1126
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:27,113
<i>It wouldn't have been a character.</i>

1127
00:48:27,196 --> 00:48:28,632
<i>It would have just been a caricature.</i>

1128
00:48:28,656 --> 00:48:30,282
<i>Yeah. Yeah.</i>

1129
00:48:30,825 --> 00:48:34,370
<i>Yeah, but he's... yeah. He's one of my
f... well I love em all, actually.</i>

1130
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:36,163
<i>- I do too.
- He's one of my favorites.</i>

1131
00:48:36,247 --> 00:48:38,833
<i>I'd be sorry not to,
I'll miss these characters.</i>

1132
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:41,836
<i>Definitely. What do you...
you think you get each of them</i>

1133
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:43,254
<i>you could delve into each of 'em</i>

1134
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:45,965
<i>and kinda come up
with a story for each of them, you know.</i>

1135
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:49,009
<i>It would, you know, at least make
a short film, or more.</i>

1136
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:51,554
Volume one details the...

1137
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:54,723
<i>- Again, if the price is right.
- Yeah, well, you know, open to offers.</i>

1138
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:57,476
<i>And this backstory is great.</i>

1139
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:02,231
<i>I just love this idea because it's,
'cause he's not just an evil villain.</i>

1140
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:06,861
<i>And you, you kind of get to see, you know,
why he's turned out like he has, you know?</i>

1141
00:49:07,153 --> 00:49:08,946
<i>- It's very sad.
- Yeah, it is quite sad.</i>

1142
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:10,739
<i>- And very silly.
- And tragic.</i>

1143
00:49:10,823 --> 00:49:12,283
Sweet and ever-magical bond.

1144
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:15,870
<i>And it is, this scrapbook sequence
was funny 'cause it didn't,</i>

1145
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:20,374
<i>kind of, fit the way we usually
did things. It wasn't 3-D and stuff.</i>

1146
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:22,543
<i>It took us ages to do it, actually.</i>

1147
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:23,919
Rat.

1148
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:29,133
While the poor boy's head was turned,
I was cruelly plunged...

1149
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:31,696
<i>And originally, I think we were going
to animate it all in 3-D,</i>

1150
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,763
<i>and in black-and-white and,
you know, do it like a home movie thing.</i>

1151
00:49:34,847 --> 00:49:38,642
<i>But it was, you know, decided it would
just be better to just keep it simple.</i>

1152
00:49:38,726 --> 00:49:41,020
<i>- It's just clearer.
- Yeah. It's more graphic.</i>

1153
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:44,356
<i>I like The Toad's memoirs
as just volume one.</i>

1154
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:45,774
<i>Yes, that's right.</i>

1155
00:49:45,858 --> 00:49:47,193
<i>- Huge book.
- Boring memoirs.</i>

1156
00:49:48,444 --> 00:49:51,864
<i>Volume 12. And on he goes.</i>

1157
00:49:52,198 --> 00:49:55,326
<i>His little champagne
bottle top chair behind him there.</i>

1158
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:56,827
<i>The rival of my legs.</i>

1159
00:49:59,497 --> 00:50:03,167
<i>Now, this is one of the oldest jokes,
isn't it, in the film?</i>

1160
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:04,418
<i>This is one of the first.</i>

1161
00:50:04,502 --> 00:50:06,086
We leave immediately.

1162
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:07,689
<i>- That was full...
- That was a new joke for us.</i>

1163
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:09,566
<i>We can say all those jokes,
whoever we borrowed it from.</i>

1164
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:12,635
<i>It probably existed before,
actually, but it's...</i>

1165
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:15,679
<i>No, I mean, in this film
it's about four years, you know?</i>

1166
00:50:15,763 --> 00:50:17,032
<i>It was in right at the beginning.</i>

1167
00:50:17,056 --> 00:50:20,518
<i>It was one of the first jokes
written and it's so good. It stayed.</i>

1168
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:21,519
<i>Love.</i>

1169
00:50:21,602 --> 00:50:23,229
<i>This was quite late when we did our...</i>

1170
00:50:23,312 --> 00:50:25,523
<i>When we wanted to get more slugs in
at the end.</i>

1171
00:50:25,606 --> 00:50:28,651
<i>We did.</i> Lady and the Tramp <i>tribute.</i>

1172
00:50:29,193 --> 00:50:31,403
- This is quite tasty.
- Thanks.

1173
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:34,406
<i>This is a nice,
quiet, sweet scene, I think.</i>

1174
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:37,326
<i>Yeah, I'm really proud of this
'cause it doesn't it's,</i>

1175
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:39,763
<i>they're quite hard to do ain't they,
these kinda quiet campfire scenes</i>

1176
00:50:39,787 --> 00:50:40,663
<i>They are.</i>

1177
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:43,791
<i>Where you kind of reveal
a bit more of the theme in the characters.</i>

1178
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:45,125
<i>Be denied</i>

1179
00:50:45,501 --> 00:50:50,339
<i>That isn't rice,
that's maggots you're eating.</i>

1180
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:52,841
<i>Larvae, larvae, larvae</i>

1181
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:57,721
Well, that explains why it all
ran to one side when I put the salt in.

1182
00:50:57,805 --> 00:51:00,575
<i>But I think there's, there's lots of nice,
general humor, as well, in it,</i>

1183
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:01,767
<i>between the two characters.</i>

1184
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:06,897
<i>And it, it never gets,
sort of, mawkish or sappy or sentimental.</i>

1185
00:51:06,981 --> 00:51:08,542
<i>And they, you know,
they never kinda sit there</i>

1186
00:51:08,566 --> 00:51:12,736
<i>and just say unrealistic things
about how they feel, you know?</i>

1187
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,215
<i>- What their dreams are.
- What their dreams are, yeah.</i>

1188
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:17,616
<i>Those scenes can be so rubbish,
couldn't they?</i>

1189
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:20,160
<i>So, but they, you know,
when you think about how much work</i>

1190
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:22,246
<i>has went into this scene,
into the writing.</i>

1191
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:23,539
So hard?

1192
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:25,183
<i>Well, we worked on it
for an awfully long time.</i>

1193
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:26,643
<i>Over and over. We did so many versions.</i>

1194
00:51:26,667 --> 00:51:30,462
<i>I mean, we certainly, we certainly went
into that very, very sentimental version.</i>

1195
00:51:30,546 --> 00:51:32,941
<i>- Yeah, we did, we did have one, yeah.
- But, for the longest time...</i>

1196
00:51:32,965 --> 00:51:35,360
<i>- Yeah, we did have one.
- We pulled it back and pulled it back</i>

1197
00:51:35,384 --> 00:51:36,861
<i>- Yeah, yeah.
- And maybe went back too far.</i>

1198
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:37,720
<i>Yeah.</i>

1199
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:41,640
<i>But I think this is great.</i>

1200
00:51:41,724 --> 00:51:45,060
<i>I think, I don't, it, it feels so natural.</i>

1201
00:51:45,144 --> 00:51:47,789
<i>It's hard to believe that Kate
and Hugh weren't recording this together.</i>

1202
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:49,231
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

1203
00:51:50,566 --> 00:51:52,246
<i>And, in a way, like, it's easy, in it's...</i>

1204
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:54,754
<i>I mean, it's not easy to do something
like the boat chase, 'cause, I mean...</i>

1205
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:56,778
<i>But it's easy to be impressive
with the boat chase.</i>

1206
00:51:56,822 --> 00:52:00,576
<i>But, this is almost hardest to...
it's actually the hardest to do this,</i>

1207
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:02,579
<i>- a scene like this.
- It's very hard to be quiet</i>

1208
00:52:02,703 --> 00:52:03,954
Brothers, sisters, cousins...

1209
00:52:04,038 --> 00:52:05,038
<i>Yeah.</i>

1210
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,058
<i>I think it's very,
very easy to go into the sentimental,</i>

1211
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:09,144
<i>- go to sentimental territory.
- Yeah, could have been, yeah.</i>

1212
00:52:09,168 --> 00:52:10,419
<i>It's tricky territory.</i>

1213
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:12,147
<i>But I think,
I do think we pulled it off, actually.</i>

1214
00:52:12,171 --> 00:52:13,005
<i>I do too.</i>

1215
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:15,090
<i>It's one of my favorite sequences
for that reason.</i>

1216
00:52:15,591 --> 00:52:17,509
No wonder you wanna get home.

1217
00:52:17,593 --> 00:52:19,887
<i>- But just, you know...
- We still put jokes in there.</i>

1218
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:22,222
<i>Exactly, yeah.
So you can end with it in... Yeah.</i>

1219
00:52:22,306 --> 00:52:24,016
<i>And you get a laugh at the end, you know?</i>

1220
00:52:25,184 --> 00:52:28,163
<i>And this scene, I mean, I just think
the lighting and everything it's just a,</i>

1221
00:52:28,187 --> 00:52:30,832
<i>'cause it's quiet it actually gives
a chance to just, kind of, look at the,</i>

1222
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:36,487
<i>some of the textures and the amazing
lighting that's going on, you know?</i>

1223
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:38,447
<i>You're not rushing through. And it's lush.</i>

1224
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:39,865
<i>I just think it's breathtaking.</i>

1225
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:41,843
<i>And the beautiful modelling
on the</i> Jammy Dodger <i>as well.</i>

1226
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:42,743
<i>Yeah.</i>

1227
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:45,287
Roddy. Don't let the bed bugs bite.

1228
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:53,671
<i>That was the fly converted into a bed bug.</i>

1229
00:52:53,754 --> 00:52:55,398
<i>We had to convert him
into the maggots as well.</i>

1230
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:56,632
<i>And use the maggots as well.</i>

1231
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:58,276
<i>You can do a lot with a fly if you keep,</i>

1232
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:01,804
<i>you know, pull his wings off,
change his color.</i>

1233
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:05,050
<i>You can do anything
with paint and a pair of tweezers.</i>

1234
00:53:07,976 --> 00:53:09,329
<i>And then this is just great fun, isn't it?</i>

1235
00:53:09,353 --> 00:53:10,854
<i>To get, get, you know...</i>

1236
00:53:10,938 --> 00:53:14,108
<i>Now, see, this whole run, I mean,
I love the whole film.</i>

1237
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:16,193
<i>But I love this run from here,</i>

1238
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:19,154
<i>all the way through to them landing back
in the apartments.</i>

1239
00:53:19,238 --> 00:53:20,715
<i>- Le Frog was such fun to write.
- Yeah.</i>

1240
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:23,009
<i>- All this frog stuff was such fun to do.
- Yeah, it is, isn't it? Yeah.</i>

1241
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:25,619
<i>'Cause you could be as silly
as you wanted.</i>

1242
00:53:25,703 --> 00:53:28,497
<i>Then we had a wonderful actor
at the end of it, making it sound good.</i>

1243
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:31,667
<i>Yeah. And you, sort of,
have to be super ridiculous, don't you?</i>

1244
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:35,462
<i>If you're gonna take on
that stupid French stereotype thing,</i>

1245
00:53:35,546 --> 00:53:39,341
<i>then you just have to push the boat out
and go with it all the way.</i>

1246
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:41,927
<i>'Cause you can't go halfway,
'cause people might think,</i>

1247
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:44,489
<i>"Hang on a minute. Do they,
have they got a problem with the French?"</i>

1248
00:53:44,513 --> 00:53:45,949
<i>- It's not that, it's like...
- Or we can...</i>

1249
00:53:45,973 --> 00:53:48,451
<i>We can, I don't think anyone would accuse
us of going halfway on this stuff.</i>

1250
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:52,855
<i>No, because you gotta have
every single French cliché in there.</i>

1251
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:56,066
<i>Even to the point of putting in mimes.</i>

1252
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:57,818
<i>Yeah. You've got it, yeah, mimes.</i>

1253
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:00,112
<i>We originally had
one Swedish frog in there.</i>

1254
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:03,949
<i>It used to be Peugeot, Renault,
Citroën, Volvo.</i>

1255
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:05,159
<i>And Volvo's was...</i>

1256
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:09,979
<i>- But Marcel took his place.
- Yeah.</i>

1257
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:12,040
<i>He missed out on a Swedish stereotype.</i>

1258
00:54:13,709 --> 00:54:16,128
<i>Oh, well, maybe in Flushed Away Two
if we ever do it.</i>

1259
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:21,717
<i>And this is, sort of,
like a great run for me, I thought.</i>

1260
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,595
<i>'Cause, you know, Paul did
a lovely job storyboarding it and,</i>

1261
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:28,932
<i>and Jeff Newitt was supervising
the sequence and he's wonderful.</i>

1262
00:54:29,016 --> 00:54:30,768
<i>- And, yeah.
- His animation.</i>

1263
00:54:30,851 --> 00:54:34,104
<i>Jeff animated the shot,
for instance, and then the lighting,</i>

1264
00:54:34,188 --> 00:54:37,441
<i>I think was, you know, really superb.</i>

1265
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:39,025
I don't have it anymore.

1266
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:40,778
<i>It's a very strange sequence.</i>

1267
00:54:40,861 --> 00:54:42,964
<i>I don't think I've ever seen
anything like it in a movie before.</i>

1268
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:44,048
<i>No, it is weird one, isn't it?</i>

1269
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:47,242
<i>Yeah. It's not necessarily
like big belly laughs, but I think it...</i>

1270
00:54:47,618 --> 00:54:51,747
<i>I'm sort of glad we got to do,
sort of, odd things like this.</i>

1271
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:53,683
<i>Somehow it comes back to music hall,
really doesn't it?</i>

1272
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:54,708
<i>- Yeah.
- To vaudeville...</i>

1273
00:54:54,792 --> 00:54:57,032
<i>Yeah, it's like this silly
vaudeville sequence, isn't it?</i>

1274
00:54:57,085 --> 00:54:59,046
<i>We've got the mushroom coming up
in a minute.</i>

1275
00:54:59,755 --> 00:55:02,883
<i>There's a shot of Le Frog holding
a mushroom and he's not had one before,</i>

1276
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:04,760
<i>or he doesn't want to have one afterwards.</i>

1277
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:06,970
- Master cable.
- "The master" what?

1278
00:55:07,054 --> 00:55:09,264
<i>- That shot's gone, mate.
- No, it's not, is it?</i>

1279
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:11,058
<i>You blinked.</i>

1280
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:13,519
<i>We missed it. Oh, it's been on,
though, already.</i>

1281
00:55:13,602 --> 00:55:14,520
The one you're now wearing.

1282
00:55:14,603 --> 00:55:16,247
<i>It's funny, 'cause the story,
in the storyboard,</i>

1283
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:17,999
<i>there was a picture of him
holding a mushroom</i>

1284
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:19,900
<i>from some old version of the sequence.</i>

1285
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:22,736
<i>So, the, the guys who were
assessing it said,</i>

1286
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:24,756
<i>"Oh yeah, mushroom.
Better get one of those made."</i>

1287
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:26,573
final this afternoon.

1288
00:55:28,951 --> 00:55:31,912
<i>So, now we're sowing little bits of plot.</i>

1289
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:33,664
Leave it to me. We'll get your cable.

1290
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:36,959
<i>- Yeah. Yeah, that, that was...
- This next joke is so outrageous.</i>

1291
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:39,837
<i>- I'm actually feeling embarrassed by it.
- Yeah.</i>

1292
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,547
<i>This is just over the line, isn't it?</i>

1293
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:42,881
<i>- This, you know.
- It is.</i>

1294
00:55:42,965 --> 00:55:45,676
<i>But, like I say,
you gotta push the boat out.</i>

1295
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:47,320
<i>If you gonna do it,
you gotta push the boat out.</i>

1296
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:49,197
<i>- If you're gonna do it, you need to do it.
- You can't do it half measures.</i>

1297
00:55:49,221 --> 00:55:50,865
<i>Yeah, you know?
But yeah, I know what you mean, I...</i>

1298
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:52,729
<i>The reindeer of death,
in the background there.</i>

1299
00:55:53,559 --> 00:55:55,060
<i>We had names for the Kung Fu moves.</i>

1300
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:57,396
<i>Yeah. There's one
doing the Reindeer of Death.</i>

1301
00:55:57,479 --> 00:55:58,480
Go for it.

1302
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:00,649
Fly at 12:00 o'clock!

1303
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:02,943
Oh, bother.

1304
00:56:06,238 --> 00:56:08,407
You fools, grab them!

1305
00:56:08,949 --> 00:56:11,493
<i>And I love this idea of,
of being underneath Hyde Park,</i>

1306
00:56:11,577 --> 00:56:13,513
<i>and it's nice to get out of the city,
wasn't it, as well?</i>

1307
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:15,622
<i>- And have a, kind of, rural sequence.
- It was.</i>

1308
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:17,332
- Cable.
- Oh, <i>mon Dieu.</i>

1309
00:56:17,416 --> 00:56:19,001
<i>You wretch! This is not over!</i>

1310
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:21,354
<i>And we wanted to get them off the boat,
didn't we? All those frogs.</i>

1311
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:22,212
<i>We did.</i>

1312
00:56:22,296 --> 00:56:25,299
<i>It was earlier on,
and we, we had too many frogs to fight.</i>

1313
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:28,468
<i>And it's storyboarding,
and we had a little joke for each frog.</i>

1314
00:56:28,552 --> 00:56:30,012
<i>And how to get rid of 'em.</i>

1315
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:32,365
<i>And the sequence
was just too long, wasn't it? So...</i>

1316
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:34,141
<i>We planned
a huge treatment plant, as well.</i>

1317
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:36,977
<i>It was, it was acid vats, and laser guns,</i>

1318
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:40,188
<i>and shooting bleach,
and huge toilet brushes.</i>

1319
00:56:40,272 --> 00:56:41,815
<i>- Conveyor belts and crushers.
- Yeah!</i>

1320
00:56:41,899 --> 00:56:43,025
<i>And big hammers, and, yeah.</i>

1321
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:46,028
<i>And this was the finale of our
treatment plant, and it was the best bit.</i>

1322
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:48,280
<i>So, we kept the best bit.
We just didn't have enough.</i>

1323
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:49,948
<i>We didn't have enough minutes.</i>

1324
00:56:50,032 --> 00:56:52,343
<i>- Or money, probably, actually.
- Yeah, yeah, no, it was just...</i>

1325
00:56:52,367 --> 00:56:53,243
<i>Or people.</i>

1326
00:56:53,327 --> 00:56:54,971
<i>- It was enough, wasn't it really, to go...
- It was.</i>

1327
00:56:54,995 --> 00:56:56,246
<i>I'm really pleased, in the end,</i>

1328
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:58,040
<i>we just got rid of all the frogs in one go</i>

1329
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:02,920
<i>and did this amazing ride
down this waterfall instead, yeah.</i>

1330
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:07,799
<i>But it's so...</i>

1331
00:57:07,883 --> 00:57:11,637
<i>I mean, this is... it's great to do
this big, kind of, action stuff.</i>

1332
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:14,723
<i>I mean, we could do something like it
with stop-frame,</i>

1333
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:18,143
<i>but it was... Just really, kind of,
opened things up for us</i>

1334
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:19,226
<i>- didn't it?
- It did.</i>

1335
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:23,273
<i>The CG environment for action sequences,
you know?</i>

1336
00:57:23,482 --> 00:57:27,778
<i>This thing from Jean,
which was the "chips and fish"</i>

1337
00:57:28,737 --> 00:57:32,115
<i>was a, was a genuine mistake
that he made in the recording studio.</i>

1338
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:34,743
<i>- And we liked it, so we kept it.
- Yeah, chips and fish.</i>

1339
00:57:35,327 --> 00:57:37,120
<i>Yeah. There's some more slugs.</i>

1340
00:57:37,204 --> 00:57:40,958
<i>- More slugs!
- Popped 'em in. Why not?</i>

1341
00:57:41,041 --> 00:57:44,086
<i>Another slug?
Go on then. Pop it in your mouth.</i>

1342
00:57:45,212 --> 00:57:46,672
Nibble for your life!

1343
00:57:46,755 --> 00:57:49,841
<i>So, we thought of many different ways
to get them out of the sewer</i>

1344
00:57:49,925 --> 00:57:54,638
<i>and up into Kensington,
and this was probably</i>

1345
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:57,724
<i>the most sensible,
the most fa... the most satisfying.</i>

1346
00:57:57,808 --> 00:57:58,684
<i>Yeah, the most simple.</i>

1347
00:57:58,767 --> 00:58:02,229
<i>We used something we'd seen earlier,
which was the duty-free bag,</i>

1348
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:04,815
<i>the British Airways one
and just shot one up through the pipe.</i>

1349
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:06,125
<i>- On the hot air drafts.
- Yeah.</i>

1350
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:07,309
<i>Simple and elegant, isn't it?</i>

1351
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:10,570
<i>It's always those solutions
that are the best in the end, you know?</i>

1352
00:58:10,988 --> 00:58:12,308
<i>We've had lots of elaborate ways.</i>

1353
00:58:12,948 --> 00:58:16,994
<i>I love Harry's score here,
when they come out. It's so amazing.</i>

1354
00:58:17,077 --> 00:58:18,704
<i>- Just so inspiring.
- Yep.</i>

1355
00:58:19,538 --> 00:58:21,790
<i>The map painter
did a beautiful job with that...</i>

1356
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:24,710
<i>giant landscape panorama of London.</i>

1357
00:58:24,793 --> 00:58:26,938
<i>- And it's beautifully drawn as well.
- It's enormous, isn't it?</i>

1358
00:58:26,962 --> 00:58:29,131
<i>- It is. It's just mammoth.
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.</i>

1359
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:31,174
<i>It is an amazing piece of work, that.</i>

1360
00:58:31,258 --> 00:58:34,344
<i>Yeah. Yeah.
And we were, some people were worried,</i>

1361
00:58:34,803 --> 00:58:37,973
<i>"Can we spend that
long looking at a background painting?"</i>

1362
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:39,766
<i>But I think they fit in there brilliantly.</i>

1363
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:40,976
<i>Yeah.</i>

1364
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:43,228
Kensington High street.
Try and go left! That's it!

1365
00:58:43,311 --> 00:58:44,146
Now, go right!

1366
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:45,915
<i>And again,
we didn't wanna spend long, did we?</i>

1367
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:48,334
<i>Because we wanted to get on
with the next part of the story, you know?</i>

1368
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:50,527
<i>We wanted to get them home quite quickly.</i>

1369
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:53,030
<i>And, very early on,
we had all kinds of mad bits of story</i>

1370
00:58:53,113 --> 00:58:54,953
<i>where they went up
onto the surface and had to,</i>

1371
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:57,951
<i>they went to a park
and they met a bird, and...</i>

1372
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:00,972
<i>We didn't want to feel as though the story
had finished when they got out, though.</i>

1373
00:59:00,996 --> 00:59:03,099
<i>So, we wanted to feel as
though their journey was continuing.</i>

1374
00:59:03,123 --> 00:59:04,166
<i>- Yeah.
- And it, actually,</i>

1375
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:06,626
<i>this is the resolution of Roddy's journey,</i>

1376
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:09,087
<i>- I mean, physical journey,
- Yeah, it's like very emotional</i>

1377
00:59:09,171 --> 00:59:10,881
<i>not, not his emotional journey.</i>

1378
00:59:11,131 --> 00:59:12,424
<i>His emotional journey.</i>

1379
00:59:12,758 --> 00:59:15,319
<i>This took about three, just about
three quarters of an hour, wasn't it?</i>

1380
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:19,431
<i>For this whole run to get to this point
here where Roddy's arrived, you know?</i>

1381
00:59:20,057 --> 00:59:22,893
<i>But he's been changed, but we
had all kinds of versions again of this,</i>

1382
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:25,187
<i>what happened when they got back
up top, you know?</i>

1383
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:27,272
<i>And there, there used to be
a time when Roddy,</i>

1384
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:30,150
<i>there was a whole society
of posh rats up there, wasn't there?</i>

1385
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:33,028
<i>That, that Roddy's friends. Lord Monckton.</i>

1386
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:34,780
<i>- Roddy was a...
- Clarissa.</i>

1387
00:59:34,863 --> 00:59:36,364
<i>Roddy was a social climbing rat,</i>

1388
00:59:36,448 --> 00:59:39,618
<i>which, in retrospect, doesn't seem
like a very good idea at all.</i>

1389
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:40,970
<i>Yes. No, it didn't really fit, did it?</i>

1390
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:43,306
<i>But we, we struggled with it,
we struggled with it for quite a while.</i>

1391
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:44,247
<i>- And...
- Yeah.</i>

1392
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:46,458
<i>Well, it's like</i>
My Fair Lady <i>for a while, wasn't it?</i>

1393
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:49,961
<i>Like she, she was like the working class
rat-girl that didn't quite fit</i>

1394
00:59:50,045 --> 00:59:54,132
<i>and she tried to fit in, and they found
a nice Barbie dress for her, didn't they?</i>

1395
00:59:54,216 --> 00:59:55,550
<i>And she made her entrance.</i>

1396
00:59:55,884 --> 00:59:57,594
<i>But she was humiliated and left in tears,</i>

1397
00:59:57,677 --> 01:00:01,056
<i>and Roddy didn't quite know what to do.</i>

1398
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:03,600
<i>- Yeah. Yeah. She left.
- She left and...</i>

1399
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:05,523
<i>- And there was Roddy in a bosom...
- She left.</i>

1400
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:07,395
<i>With his pal, Lord Monckton.</i>

1401
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:11,316
<i>Had a penchant for shiny nuts, it seemed.</i>

1402
01:00:11,399 --> 01:00:12,609
<i>He did.</i>

1403
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:15,779
<i>It wasn't very good, though.</i>

1404
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:17,489
<i>- It wasn't.
- Sorry for that.</i>

1405
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:19,199
<i>And it went on for ages.</i>

1406
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:20,575
<i>- Ages and ages.
- It did.</i>

1407
01:00:20,659 --> 01:00:22,994
<i>We spent so long struggling,
trying to make it work.</i>

1408
01:00:23,078 --> 01:00:25,956
<i>Because we thought that was the way to go
within this, you know,</i>

1409
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:29,209
<i>as you start to change characters,
new solutions start to reveal themselves.</i>

1410
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:33,421
<i>- And, again, simple and elegant...
- Yeah, yeah.</i>

1411
01:00:33,505 --> 01:00:34,714
<i>Seemed to be the way to go.</i>

1412
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:36,424
<i>And, to be fair, this whole f...</i>

1413
01:00:36,508 --> 01:00:39,553
<i>This whole issue of family that we built
in with Roddy that, you know,</i>

1414
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:41,513
<i>that he, he doesn't really have a family,</i>

1415
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:44,099
<i>but he's made a family out of dolls</i>

1416
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:46,101
<i>- and action figures around the house...
- Yeah.</i>

1417
01:00:46,685 --> 01:00:48,395
<i>Wasn't a part of that story.</i>

1418
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:51,666
<i>- No, that came later, didn't it?
- It did.</i>

1419
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:54,067
<i>You know, the front
of the film and then this section.</i>

1420
01:00:54,151 --> 01:00:56,027
<i>It was just the, the two ends of that.</i>

1421
01:00:56,111 --> 01:00:59,614
<i>But it fitted perfectly with the idea
of having Rita's family in the film,</i>

1422
01:00:59,698 --> 01:01:03,118
<i>and having her surrounded
by family and him not really.</i>

1423
01:01:04,411 --> 01:01:06,788
<i>It, you know, it all kinda came together,</i>

1424
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:10,709
<i>but we never knew that that's
what the film was about, did we, at first?</i>

1425
01:01:10,792 --> 01:01:13,086
<i>You know, we thought it was all about
you know,</i>

1426
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:15,422
<i>a posh rat that meets a working class rat.</i>

1427
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:17,382
No, no, no, it's not actually.

1428
01:01:17,465 --> 01:01:18,800
Then why the lock and bars?

1429
01:01:18,884 --> 01:01:22,179
Well, it's my home security system.

1430
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:27,642
So much to see,
so little time to see it in. Shall we?

1431
01:01:27,976 --> 01:01:31,479
<i>So, this is where Roddy's world is
about to come crashing down, sadly.</i>

1432
01:01:31,563 --> 01:01:33,648
Here. Aren't you?

1433
01:01:34,649 --> 01:01:37,652
<i>Yeah.
It was some really sensitive acting here.</i>

1434
01:01:37,736 --> 01:01:39,779
<i>The, the animators did a great job.</i>

1435
01:01:39,863 --> 01:01:40,863
Who's that?

1436
01:01:41,865 --> 01:01:44,284
That would, would be my brother!

1437
01:01:44,993 --> 01:01:47,454
<i>Shane Richie
coming back to liven things up again.</i>

1438
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:52,542
<i>I think most of this was ad-lib,
and we cut it together and actually sadly.</i>

1439
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:56,338
- Hello!
- Rita, this is Rupert.

1440
01:01:56,421 --> 01:01:58,465
- What?
- Rupert, this is Rita.

1441
01:01:58,798 --> 01:02:03,053
She's been so looking forward
to meeting my brother.

1442
01:02:04,054 --> 01:02:06,389
Obviously, there's not a huge
family resemblance.

1443
01:02:06,473 --> 01:02:09,809
I rather got the brains and,
well, actually, I got the looks, too.

1444
01:02:09,893 --> 01:02:11,579
<i>Nice bit of acting from Hugh here.
It's lovely.</i>

1445
01:02:11,603 --> 01:02:12,955
We're pretty close, aren't we, Rupert?

1446
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:15,815
<i>It's funny, really,
'cause this scene, it's like,</i>

1447
01:02:15,899 --> 01:02:18,151
<i>probably the longest
little dialogue scene,</i>

1448
01:02:18,235 --> 01:02:19,945
<i>apart from the bedtime scene, you know?</i>

1449
01:02:20,028 --> 01:02:23,949
<i>It's actually one of the, it's like
a breather, isn't it really, you know?</i>

1450
01:02:24,032 --> 01:02:26,326
<i>- Like, we...
- And the film's very frenetic and...</i>

1451
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:27,535
<i>It's very pacey, isn't it?</i>

1452
01:02:27,619 --> 01:02:29,222
<i>- And then you get this rest here.
- It is.</i>

1453
01:02:29,246 --> 01:02:30,080
Come here!

1454
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:32,683
<i>I think we made it a bit too pacey,
actually, looking at it critically,</i>

1455
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:33,851
<i>- I think...
- At times, yeah.</i>

1456
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:35,335
<i>At times, you think so.</i>

1457
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:36,562
<i>But then I, on the other hand,</i>

1458
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:39,172
<i>it's kinda good that you wanna go back
and see it again,</i>

1459
01:02:39,256 --> 01:02:42,467
<i>'cause you maybe don't feel
like you caught it all, you know.</i>

1460
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:44,135
<i>So, I guess it works on that level.</i>

1461
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:47,050
<i>But I guess we're just old really,
aren't we, like...</i>

1462
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:50,141
<i>Speak for yourself only,
I mean, I said it before, 24.</i>

1463
01:02:50,225 --> 01:02:51,393
<i>- Yeah, you're only 24.</i>

1464
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:55,689
<i>As a, sort of, 50 year-old,
I find my pacemaker gets a little bit,</i>

1465
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:58,858
<i>you know, juddery in some
of the faster bits of the movie.</i>

1466
01:02:59,192 --> 01:03:01,444
<i>Actually, these days I like to say
I'm approaching 40,</i>

1467
01:03:01,528 --> 01:03:03,905
<i>but I do, I don't say
from which direction.</i>

1468
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:08,660
I can do whatever I want,
whenever I want to.

1469
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:10,221
I mean, I'd say that's a little
more than...

1470
01:03:10,245 --> 01:03:12,038
<i>I love Harry's theme
that keeps coming back</i>

1471
01:03:12,122 --> 01:03:13,724
<i>- in his stuff, you know.
- Yeah, it's lovely.</i>

1472
01:03:13,748 --> 01:03:16,084
<i>I mean, he really tied the
whole story together.</i>

1473
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:19,212
I'm sorry but if you have everything
you need then

1474
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:21,210
I really have to get goin'.

1475
01:03:21,965 --> 01:03:24,592
I have a serious infestation to deal with.

1476
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:27,178
I'll...

1477
01:03:27,262 --> 01:03:31,016
<i>And, it's funny, this scene because
you wouldn't get this in like a,</i>

1478
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,144
<i>I s'pose you, maybe you would.</i>

1479
01:03:36,271 --> 01:03:38,833
<i>It's, kind of, like, this is where, like,
DreamWorks meets Aardman, I think.</i>

1480
01:03:38,857 --> 01:03:40,859
<i>You know, like,
in, certainly in the animation.</i>

1481
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:44,779
<i>You know, it's like this really, sort of,
subtle and quite, naturalistic acting.</i>

1482
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:12,974
<i>Lonely I'm Mr. Lonely</i>

1483
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:18,730
<i>I have nobody for my own</i>

1484
01:04:23,902 --> 01:04:26,279
<i>Only ten minutes left till half-time</i>

1485
01:04:26,363 --> 01:04:28,174
<i>and what an amazing match
this has been for England.</i>

1486
01:04:28,198 --> 01:04:29,908
Come on, England! This is fantastic!

1487
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:32,803
<i>You really have to watch all the football
stuff going on in the background,</i>

1488
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:35,538
<i>because it's, it's, it is hilarious.</i>

1489
01:04:35,622 --> 01:04:37,874
<i>And we just let the animators run with it,</i>

1490
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:42,045
<i>and there's a lot of jokes in there
for the eagle-eyed.</i>

1491
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:43,838
<i>Yeah, it was fun, wasn't it?</i>

1492
01:04:43,922 --> 01:04:46,549
<i>Just to, like, send them off to do it
and we didn't see anything,</i>

1493
01:04:46,633 --> 01:04:49,052
<i>and then they just came back with
a ton of this stuff,</i>

1494
01:04:49,135 --> 01:04:50,470
<i>and it's all completely crazy.</i>

1495
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:53,681
<i>It is. And it runs
right through till the end of the movie.</i>

1496
01:04:53,765 --> 01:04:56,101
<i>Yeah. Yeah. It's very creative.</i>

1497
01:04:56,184 --> 01:04:57,745
<i>John Motson puts the odd quip in,
doesn't he?</i>

1498
01:04:57,769 --> 01:05:01,147
<i>If you listen to the commentary
from the TV commentator.</i>

1499
01:05:01,231 --> 01:05:03,084
A word of advice, mate.
Take it easy with the drinking.

1500
01:05:03,108 --> 01:05:04,734
<i>I mean, it's very dry but he is always,</i>

1501
01:05:04,818 --> 01:05:07,737
<i>sort of, making Germany sound
a bit rubbish.</i>

1502
01:05:08,071 --> 01:05:11,241
<i>I think we might've, yeah.
I think we picked those takes.</i>

1503
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:14,428
<i>I think John Motson
was a bit biased, though.</i>

1504
01:05:14,452 --> 01:05:16,538
Don't want to miss any of the game.

1505
01:05:16,621 --> 01:05:19,457
Half-time. He's waiting till half-time.

1506
01:05:19,541 --> 01:05:23,128
<i>A funny moment coming up
where Sid goes all slow-motion.</i>

1507
01:05:23,211 --> 01:05:24,337
No!

1508
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:27,549
- Not the master cable!
- What do you want...

1509
01:05:27,632 --> 01:05:31,636
<i>We quite liked the idea of the joke,
but we rushed it.</i>

1510
01:05:31,719 --> 01:05:32,720
<i>- Yeah.
- I think it's,</i>

1511
01:05:32,804 --> 01:05:34,865
<i>I think it's funny
to some people, and weird to others.</i>

1512
01:05:34,889 --> 01:05:35,723
<i>Yeah.</i>

1513
01:05:35,807 --> 01:05:37,159
<i>I wish we'd animated, in the animation,</i>

1514
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:38,893
<i>I wish he'd snapped himself out of it</i>

1515
01:05:38,977 --> 01:05:41,938
<i>and looked a bit puzzled himself
about it having happened.</i>

1516
01:05:42,522 --> 01:05:45,692
<i>But he just goes neutral there,
which is a shame.</i>

1517
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:50,363
<i>I wish he was, like, as if he'd
been taken over by something for a moment,</i>

1518
01:05:50,447 --> 01:05:54,325
<i>but, you know, it's only a few,
small things like that you look at,</i>

1519
01:05:54,409 --> 01:05:56,161
<i>and you wish you had another shot at it.</i>

1520
01:05:56,244 --> 01:05:57,495
<i>We can maybe do a reshoot.</i>

1521
01:05:58,163 --> 01:06:00,790
<i>Where's the animator?
Let me get in touch with him.</i>

1522
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:04,127
<i>You think he would mind
if I pop up round his house?</i>

1523
01:06:05,128 --> 01:06:06,772
<i>I thought you could take your computer
with you.</i>

1524
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:08,798
<i>Yeah. 'Scuse me, remember that shot?</i>

1525
01:06:08,882 --> 01:06:10,842
First thing about football.

1526
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:14,012
<i>Well, it's fun to get an America,
a stupid American stereotype</i>

1527
01:06:14,095 --> 01:06:18,016
<i>into the film as well, seeing as
we had stupid Italian and French.</i>

1528
01:06:18,099 --> 01:06:20,643
<i>And English stereotypes in.
- And English.</i>

1529
01:06:20,727 --> 01:06:22,896
- Lab reject!
- Ha! You missed!

1530
01:06:24,022 --> 01:06:27,442
<i>This little joke of Spike falling
in the pins was almost an afterthought,</i>

1531
01:06:27,525 --> 01:06:29,569
<i>- but, eh, people...
- Yeah.</i>

1532
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:32,489
<i>People really seem to enjoy
seeing Spike in terrible pain.</i>

1533
01:06:32,572 --> 01:06:33,781
<i>Spike spiked.</i>

1534
01:06:34,574 --> 01:06:35,617
Hey!

1535
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:37,261
<i>Yeah, things like that, they always look,</i>

1536
01:06:37,285 --> 01:06:39,704
<i>they're, like,
just very funny in storyboard form,</i>

1537
01:06:39,787 --> 01:06:43,625
<i>but then once they're lit and then they're
real pins sticking into his...</i>

1538
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:45,543
<i>really sort of solid character,</i>

1539
01:06:45,627 --> 01:06:48,254
<i>it looks even, it looks more painful
than comic sometimes.</i>

1540
01:06:52,050 --> 01:06:54,469
Let there be light!

1541
01:06:57,764 --> 01:06:59,474
<i>Le Frog there is just looking
at his nails.</i>

1542
01:06:59,557 --> 01:07:00,951
<i>You know, it's a tiny little touch.</i>

1543
01:07:00,975 --> 01:07:03,019
<i>- He doesn't care.
- He's not interested at all.</i>

1544
01:07:03,603 --> 01:07:05,915
<i>I love that transition
from the previous scene to this scene.</i>

1545
01:07:05,939 --> 01:07:08,209
<i>- I thought it worked really well.
- Yeah, it did work really well.</i>

1546
01:07:08,233 --> 01:07:10,252
<i>- You're right, actually, yeah.
- The sound. Sid's scream.</i>

1547
01:07:10,276 --> 01:07:12,445
<i>It was more linear, wasn't it?</i>

1548
01:07:12,529 --> 01:07:16,866
<i>At one point but then we start
in to cutting a lot more, you know,</i>

1549
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:20,036
<i>we... that scene wasn't there for a while.</i>

1550
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:23,122
<i>But we've, we cut ahead to see Rita
captured, then back to Roddy,</i>

1551
01:07:23,206 --> 01:07:25,375
<i>- and we try to cut back and forward,
- Yeah.</i>

1552
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:28,086
<i>And really get the pace going
into the third act here.</i>

1553
01:07:28,169 --> 01:07:30,409
- Be the best pet ever.
- Then the place is all yours.

1554
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:32,549
<i>And Harry really
helped with this score as well.</i>

1555
01:07:32,632 --> 01:07:35,343
<i>- He did.
- This sense of Roddy becoming a hero.</i>

1556
01:07:35,969 --> 01:07:37,363
<i>I love... It's a big job to do down there.</i>

1557
01:07:37,387 --> 01:07:40,223
<i>I love that line.
Nobody ever laughs at it.</i>

1558
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:42,225
<i>But I'm very happy with that.</i>

1559
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:44,394
<i>Yeah, it makes, it makes me smile.</i>

1560
01:07:44,477 --> 01:07:46,938
Geronimo!

1561
01:07:47,021 --> 01:07:48,690
<i>- This is a lovely shot, isn't it?
- Yeah.</i>

1562
01:07:49,274 --> 01:07:51,594
<i>Yeah, we didn't, yeah...
I didn't think they could do that.</i>

1563
01:07:51,651 --> 01:07:53,194
<i>- But they did.
- They did.</i>

1564
01:07:53,278 --> 01:07:56,864
And he shall be our savior
from the Great Flood!

1565
01:07:57,740 --> 01:08:00,118
- Left hand-side.
- I'm terribly sorry.

1566
01:08:00,618 --> 01:08:02,620
<i>Just two minutes left till half-time.</i>

1567
01:08:02,704 --> 01:08:04,122
<i>- Funny football again.
- Yeah.</i>

1568
01:08:05,248 --> 01:08:06,666
<i>So, how many people in this crowd?</i>

1569
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:08,936
<i>- It's about a thousand, isn't it?
- Over a thousand, yeah.</i>

1570
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:10,145
<i>- Astonishing.
- A thousand rats.</i>

1571
01:08:10,169 --> 01:08:12,255
<i>And there's people
standing on the fountains and...</i>

1572
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:14,465
<i>- And they're all unique, which is...
- Yeah.</i>

1573
01:08:15,216 --> 01:08:16,936
<i>Yeah,
they've each got a name, haven't they?</i>

1574
01:08:16,968 --> 01:08:18,362
<i>They've each got a first and second name,</i>

1575
01:08:18,386 --> 01:08:21,639
<i>like, that goes with their head
and body type, or something like that.</i>

1576
01:08:22,056 --> 01:08:24,851
<i>So, everyone's got a name,
as well as a separate costume.</i>

1577
01:08:27,186 --> 01:08:28,186
Rita!

1578
01:08:28,730 --> 01:08:31,357
Fans for the fans!
Get your England fans here!

1579
01:08:31,441 --> 01:08:35,111
<i>This is just... just bizarre.</i>

1580
01:08:35,194 --> 01:08:37,447
<i>I do think we've got this thing
where we have to try</i>

1581
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:38,448
<i>and make everything funny,</i>

1582
01:08:38,531 --> 01:08:40,325
<i>and the only way we could make that funny</i>

1583
01:08:40,408 --> 01:08:42,702
<i>was to make
him say "balloons" in a funny way.</i>

1584
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:45,204
<i>- So, we...
- And fans for the fans.</i>

1585
01:08:45,288 --> 01:08:47,874
<i>The actor, Roger Blake,
who did the balloon seller,</i>

1586
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:50,793
<i>as well as the policeman,
he did it very well.</i>

1587
01:08:50,877 --> 01:08:52,920
<i>Yeah. I like that we did that.</i>

1588
01:08:53,004 --> 01:08:55,965
<i>I mean, they're not really
hilarious things at all,</i>

1589
01:08:56,049 --> 01:08:57,943
<i>and they're prob,
probably not funny in themselves,</i>

1590
01:08:57,967 --> 01:08:59,727
<i>but, I just like it,
that we just kept trying</i>

1591
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:01,346
<i>to make everything funny</i>

1592
01:09:01,429 --> 01:09:03,449
<i>- It's really quite textured.
- As we possibly could just, yeah...</i>

1593
01:09:03,473 --> 01:09:05,273
When that whistle blows
and everyone up top...

1594
01:09:05,308 --> 01:09:06,619
<i>We always try to go for the funny option,</i>

1595
01:09:06,643 --> 01:09:08,287
<i>- I think, at the time.
- Yeah. Yeah, as well.</i>

1596
01:09:08,311 --> 01:09:10,563
<i>And The Toad's got a mace, a mace, is it?</i>

1597
01:09:10,647 --> 01:09:12,315
<i>- What is it? A scepter.
- Yes.</i>

1598
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:14,776
<i>It's part then,
it's a cotton bud with that old ruby,</i>

1599
01:09:14,859 --> 01:09:18,112
<i>all glued back together
and stuck on it with sellotape.</i>

1600
01:09:18,738 --> 01:09:20,615
<i>I don't think you get to quite read it,</i>

1601
01:09:20,698 --> 01:09:23,660
<i>but, again, you know,
it was just worth doing the funny version.</i>

1602
01:09:23,743 --> 01:09:24,743
<i>It was.</i>

1603
01:09:25,328 --> 01:09:27,997
<i>The Toad's collection was originally
much larger and</i>

1604
01:09:28,081 --> 01:09:30,201
<i>- we didn't get to use a lot of the props,
- Oh, yeah.</i>

1605
01:09:30,249 --> 01:09:32,269
<i>But we did get to use them here.
We put them in the grandstand.</i>

1606
01:09:32,293 --> 01:09:33,854
<i>- See.
- Oh, yeah, there's the bobble heads.</i>

1607
01:09:33,878 --> 01:09:34,980
<i>We had the bobble heads of...</i>

1608
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:38,007
<i>We had the whole Royal Family
made in bobble-head form, didn't we?</i>

1609
01:09:38,091 --> 01:09:40,176
<i>- We did. I would love a set of those.
- Yeah.</i>

1610
01:09:42,136 --> 01:09:43,554
You don't need us for that.

1611
01:09:44,222 --> 01:09:47,141
You think you're so clever, don't you?

1612
01:09:47,225 --> 01:09:53,439
Well, I'll be the one laughing when
every last, revolting rat is flushed away.

1613
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:58,945
For I shall repopulate the city!
With these!

1614
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:00,822
<i>So, this is just beautiful.</i>

1615
01:10:00,905 --> 01:10:03,866
<i>They're, this is I think it's one
of the most beautiful shots in the movie.</i>

1616
01:10:03,950 --> 01:10:05,034
<i>Yeah.</i>

1617
01:10:05,118 --> 01:10:07,358
<i>In fact, the lighting in
this whole sequence is gorgeous.</i>

1618
01:10:07,412 --> 01:10:10,498
<i>Yeah, no, I was really pleased
with the lighting in this sequence,</i>

1619
01:10:10,581 --> 01:10:12,750
<i>and all of them, actually.</i>

1620
01:10:12,834 --> 01:10:17,839
<i>If you look in the background Fat Barry's
holding a pickle.</i>

1621
01:10:19,090 --> 01:10:21,926
<i>And, just, in that previous shot, when,
when Whitey said,</i>

1622
01:10:22,009 --> 01:10:27,140
<i>"Oh dear" or "nasty, "you'll see it
again in a minute, here comes the pickle.</i>

1623
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:28,808
<i>There! Just on the left-hand side.</i>

1624
01:10:28,891 --> 01:10:30,977
<i>Just behind Rita. Barry's got a pickle.</i>

1625
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:35,440
<i>'Cause we had a joke about pickles
and jars in,</i>

1626
01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:39,110
<i>but we, cut that joke out
'cause it wasn't very funny.</i>

1627
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,200
<i>And we, actually,
we filled the time with this.</i>

1628
01:10:41,779 --> 01:10:47,160
<i>But we had quite a lengthy sequence where
the rats, Spike and Whitey resign.</i>

1629
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:48,828
<i>- They resign.
- That's right.</i>

1630
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:51,181
<i>And it was, it was very funny,
but it was taking so long that we,</i>

1631
01:10:51,205 --> 01:10:52,850
<i>- Yeah.
- We went with this action-packed...</i>

1632
01:10:52,874 --> 01:10:54,041
<i>- Yeah.
- Silly version.</i>

1633
01:10:54,125 --> 01:10:56,478
<i>Everything kicked off, yeah.
And they'd already started shooting it,</i>

1634
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:58,963
<i>so this pickle was sitting
around in the scene by then.</i>

1635
01:10:59,464 --> 01:11:02,633
<i>And I asked the guys
to leave it in, you know,</i>

1636
01:11:02,717 --> 01:11:04,385
<i>and I think they were a bit reluctant</i>

1637
01:11:04,469 --> 01:11:06,822
<i>'cause they're such perfectionists,
and they do everything so well,</i>

1638
01:11:06,846 --> 01:11:09,724
<i>they didn't wanna, didn't want
it to look like they'd made a mistake.</i>

1639
01:11:09,807 --> 01:11:11,684
<i>So, I had to hold my hand up.</i>

1640
01:11:11,768 --> 01:11:14,103
<i>- Take responsibility.
- I like it, I think it's funny.</i>

1641
01:11:14,187 --> 01:11:15,646
<i>Yeah. It is funny.</i>

1642
01:11:18,649 --> 01:11:21,110
<i>So, we're getting to the end
of the movie, now,</i>

1643
01:11:21,194 --> 01:11:23,905
<i>and it's at this point that we, sort of,</i>

1644
01:11:23,988 --> 01:11:25,549
<i>we tried to get
all the little loose threads</i>

1645
01:11:25,573 --> 01:11:28,701
<i>that we'd set up in the movie,
and use things that we'd seen before,</i>

1646
01:11:28,785 --> 01:11:32,872
<i>and just finish off The Toad
and ruin his plan.</i>

1647
01:11:32,955 --> 01:11:33,956
<i>- So...
- Yeah.</i>

1648
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:35,768
<i>I'm very happy with the way
we used The Toad's tongue</i>

1649
01:11:35,792 --> 01:11:37,352
<i>and used Le Frog's tongue,
and things with...</i>

1650
01:11:37,376 --> 01:11:38,211
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

1651
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:40,505
<i>It set up with the freezing pipes
and saved the day.</i>

1652
01:11:40,588 --> 01:11:41,506
<i>It's funny, isn't it, that?</i>

1653
01:11:41,589 --> 01:11:43,400
<i>It takes, it's, kind of,
quite a puzzle at the end</i>

1654
01:11:43,424 --> 01:11:47,053
<i>to get everything to work all,
sort of, organically.</i>

1655
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:49,490
<i>It helped that we knew what we
were going to do from the very beginning.</i>

1656
01:11:49,514 --> 01:11:50,783
<i>We knew we were gonna freeze that wave.</i>

1657
01:11:50,807 --> 01:11:52,785
<i>We always knew how it was gonna,
yeah, we always wanted to...</i>

1658
01:11:52,809 --> 01:11:55,353
<i>- Few people wanted us to shut the gate...
- Shut the gate!</i>

1659
01:11:55,436 --> 01:11:57,605
<i>- And get The Toad behind it,
- Yeah.</i>

1660
01:11:57,688 --> 01:11:59,982
<i>But we, we thought
the freezing wave would be spectacular,</i>

1661
01:12:00,066 --> 01:12:01,442
<i>and exciting, and different.</i>

1662
01:12:01,526 --> 01:12:02,860
<i>- I'm so glad we did it.
- Yeah.</i>

1663
01:12:02,944 --> 01:12:05,464
<i>'Cause trussing that gate would
be a bit of an anti-climax, I think.</i>

1664
01:12:05,488 --> 01:12:06,632
<i>- Closing that gate...
- Yeah.</i>

1665
01:12:06,656 --> 01:12:08,050
<i>That would've been appallingly dull.</i>

1666
01:12:08,074 --> 01:12:12,078
<i>I quite liked, somebody suggested putting
lots of couscous or Semolina in it.</i>

1667
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:14,181
<i>- That would have been good.
- The whey of the wave.</i>

1668
01:12:14,205 --> 01:12:15,915
<i>Yeah, it would all swell up,</i>

1669
01:12:15,998 --> 01:12:17,518
<i>and everyone would be left trudging around</i>

1670
01:12:17,542 --> 01:12:20,419
<i>in lots of Semolina
for the rest of their...</i>

1671
01:12:20,753 --> 01:12:23,023
<i>- And jelly was another suggestion.
- That would have been a good one.</i>

1672
01:12:23,047 --> 01:12:24,858
<i>We sort of used it
in the boat chase eventually,</i>

1673
01:12:24,882 --> 01:12:26,175
<i>Yeah, we used that, yeah.</i>

1674
01:12:26,259 --> 01:12:28,379
<i>- We thought to put it in the next joke.
- Yeah. Yeah.</i>

1675
01:12:32,723 --> 01:12:33,843
<i>This water's looking lovely.</i>

1676
01:12:34,517 --> 01:12:35,517
<i>Amazing, isn't it?</i>

1677
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:38,729
<i>It's just the power of this.
And the sound is extraordinary.</i>

1678
01:12:38,813 --> 01:12:41,148
<i>I'm sorry we didn't,
make this shot a bit longer.</i>

1679
01:12:41,232 --> 01:12:42,066
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

1680
01:12:42,149 --> 01:12:44,419
<i>It could've been about four times as long.
That would've been funny.</i>

1681
01:12:44,443 --> 01:12:46,088
<i>We could've really stretched that,
couldn't we?</i>

1682
01:12:46,112 --> 01:12:48,739
<i>But we lost, well, so,
we lost our nerve, I s'pose.</i>

1683
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:50,283
Rita!

1684
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:52,577
<i>- Oh, well.</i>
<i>- Ah, well.</i> C'est la vie.

1685
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:54,287
<i>As he would say.</i>

1686
01:12:57,415 --> 01:12:58,415
<i>Yeah.</i>

1687
01:12:58,624 --> 01:13:00,501
- Feeling a little tongue-tied?
- Impossible!

1688
01:13:00,585 --> 01:13:02,545
<i>Shocking. Positively shocking.</i>

1689
01:13:02,837 --> 01:13:04,130
<i>It's great this bit.</i>

1690
01:13:04,213 --> 01:13:06,090
<i>I'm so pleased because
it's so bloody stupid,</i>

1691
01:13:06,173 --> 01:13:09,802
<i>and, yet, it's kinda thrilling
and exciting and feels like a big movie.</i>

1692
01:13:09,886 --> 01:13:12,167
<i>But we've managed to do it all
in a completely stupid way.</i>

1693
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:13,598
<i>- We kept it silly.
- Yeah.</i>

1694
01:13:13,681 --> 01:13:16,475
<i>- Yeah. I think that's the key to...
- No matter how stupid the jokes.</i>

1695
01:13:18,352 --> 01:13:19,937
<i>Yeah, that's a stupid joke for you.</i>

1696
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:22,106
<i>Surfing slugs.</i>

1697
01:13:22,189 --> 01:13:24,400
<i>It's the power of this effects work
though, isn't it?</i>

1698
01:13:24,483 --> 01:13:26,563
<i>- It's wonderful.
- I mean, it's so bloody brilliant.</i>

1699
01:13:26,611 --> 01:13:28,672
<i>Look at the water swelling
as it freezes, it looks wonderful.</i>

1700
01:13:28,696 --> 01:13:30,406
<i>Yeah. It's so brilliant.</i>

1701
01:13:32,617 --> 01:13:35,786
<i>It just feels so tangible and scary.</i>

1702
01:13:37,705 --> 01:13:40,458
<i>And you really can put jokes
in amongst that.</i>

1703
01:13:40,541 --> 01:13:43,002
<i>And it's just a...
you just get a great tone.</i>

1704
01:13:43,085 --> 01:13:46,923
<i>I think, because we care about the family,
it really makes it... terrifying.</i>

1705
01:13:47,006 --> 01:13:48,299
<i>- So, that it's...
- Yeah. Yeah.</i>

1706
01:13:48,382 --> 01:13:49,735
<i>It gave a lot of reason to get her family.</i>

1707
01:13:49,759 --> 01:13:51,594
<i>- It makes it warm and real.
- Yeah.</i>

1708
01:13:54,221 --> 01:13:56,641
Look! It's Roddy and Rita!

1709
01:13:56,724 --> 01:14:00,728
- Good on ya, girl.
- Hooray for Millicent Bystander!

1710
01:14:00,811 --> 01:14:03,439
Millicent! Millicent!

1711
01:14:03,522 --> 01:14:05,232
<i>Apology to</i> The Naked Gun.

1712
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:07,902
You're a hero, Roddy.

1713
01:14:10,363 --> 01:14:11,363
Big deal.

1714
01:14:12,323 --> 01:14:14,492
<i>I like that.
They, he did a great sound job there,</i>

1715
01:14:14,575 --> 01:14:15,409

01:14:15,493 --> 01:14:17,054
<i>- frog and toad round that,
- Yes, both of them.</i>

1717
01:14:17,078 --> 01:14:18,430
<i>Without having to animate it.
I thought that was brilliant.</i>

1718
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:20,414
<i>We were very lucky, our sound guys
were wonderful.</i>

1719
01:14:21,415 --> 01:14:22,750
And get your kids a puppy!

1720
01:14:26,045 --> 01:14:27,922
<i>- Nice bit of acting here, as well.
- Yeah.</i>

1721
01:14:28,005 --> 01:14:30,967
<i>It's just beautifully done and sort of,
big movie.</i>

1722
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:32,343
<i>Jammy Dodger Marque-Two,</i>

1723
01:14:32,426 --> 01:14:37,014
you wouldn't happen to need
a first mate, would you?

1724
01:14:39,225 --> 01:14:42,478
<i>So, now we got the
Tina Turner song and more slugs.</i>

1725
01:14:42,561 --> 01:14:43,479
<i>The big finale.</i>

1726
01:14:43,562 --> 01:14:44,802
<i>- Yeah, more slugs
- More slugs.</i>

1727
01:14:44,855 --> 01:14:46,190
<i>Than you can shake a stick at.</i>

1728
01:14:46,273 --> 01:14:49,068
<i>I must, this song is actually hugely long,</i>

1729
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:52,154
<i>but it's a really, really
fantastic music edit by John Venzon.</i>

1730
01:14:52,238 --> 01:14:53,882
<i>- He did a really beautiful job on it.
- Yeah, yeah.</i>

1731
01:14:53,906 --> 01:14:55,384
<i>He did a lovely job cutting this,
didn't he?</i>

1732
01:14:55,408 --> 01:14:56,927
<i>He did a lovely job cutting the movie.</i>

1733
01:14:56,951 --> 01:14:58,411
<i>- But it's...
- Yeah, yeah.</i>

1734
01:14:58,494 --> 01:15:00,013
<i>No, he's really good
with music, wasn't he?</i>

1735
01:15:00,037 --> 01:15:01,539
<i>He's fantastic with music.</i>

1736
01:15:04,083 --> 01:15:05,960
<i>- Happy ending.
- Yeah.</i>

1737
01:15:06,794 --> 01:15:10,006
<i>Well, it's fun, I mean it really
plays so well in the theaters, doesn't it?</i>

1738
01:15:10,089 --> 01:15:11,132
<i>It really does.</i>

1739
01:15:11,215 --> 01:15:12,275
<i>You know, you just let, you,</i>

1740
01:15:12,299 --> 01:15:16,012
<i>you go out with a bang and, you know,
everyone's kind of jazzed about it.</i>

1741
01:15:17,847 --> 01:15:19,658
<i>I was worried, at first,
that it would just seem, like,</i>

1742
01:15:19,682 --> 01:15:22,560
<i>gratuitous that we were just doing
the song at the end.</i>

1743
01:15:22,643 --> 01:15:24,937
<i>To try and cheer everybody up.</i>

1744
01:15:25,479 --> 01:15:28,482
<i>But it's amazing,
just the power of music, and just how it.</i>

1745
01:15:28,566 --> 01:15:29,859
<i>- The energy?
- Yeah.</i>

1746
01:15:29,942 --> 01:15:31,777
<i>Just how it gets everyone going.</i>

1747
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:36,115
<i>Then again, we always tryin'
to do it in a stupid way.</i>

1748
01:15:36,198 --> 01:15:37,241
<i>Keep it silly.</i>

1749
01:15:38,034 --> 01:15:39,243
<i>"England lose on penalties"</i>

1750
01:15:39,326 --> 01:15:40,494
<i>- Oh, dear.
- Yeah, that too.</i>

1751
01:15:40,578 --> 01:15:43,456
<i>Well, I mean it was a bit of a stretch to,</i>

1752
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:46,018
<i>for us to suggest England
and Germany were in the World Cup Final.</i>

1753
01:15:46,042 --> 01:15:47,561
<i>We couldn't go all the way,
and have them win.</i>

1754
01:15:47,585 --> 01:15:48,586
<i>No, that is true.</i>

1755
01:15:48,836 --> 01:15:51,273
<i>Although, at one point in the summer,
I thought we might do it.</i>

1756
01:15:51,297 --> 01:15:53,257
<i>I don't know what came over me.</i>

1757
01:15:54,175 --> 01:15:56,052
<i>Must have been
the hot weather, or something.</i>

1758
01:15:56,135 --> 01:15:57,135
Now, Spike.

1759
01:15:57,720 --> 01:16:00,473
<i>It's wishful thinking.
We're a lot, we all want to win.</i>

1760
01:16:03,726 --> 01:16:05,561
- Shall we?
- Go for it.

1761
01:16:06,270 --> 01:16:07,980
<i>Big wheel keep on turning, turning</i>

1762
01:16:08,064 --> 01:16:10,399
<i>There are, there's a ton of slugs now.</i>

1763
01:16:10,483 --> 01:16:12,401
<i>Buckets and buckets of slugs.</i>

1764
01:16:13,944 --> 01:16:14,987
<i>Tons of them.</i>

1765
01:16:15,071 --> 01:16:16,405
<i>On the river</i>

1766
01:16:17,698 --> 01:16:21,911
<i>Rolling, rolling, rolling on the river</i>

1767
01:16:22,953 --> 01:16:24,330
<i>Too many jokes in this shot.</i>

1768
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:27,792
<i>Probably, you know, just so you could
see the mime and the guy thumbing a lift.</i>

1769
01:16:27,875 --> 01:16:31,212
<i>- Oh, well. We pack it in.
- Get it all in.</i>

1770
01:16:31,545 --> 01:16:33,297
<i>Well, it was fun making the film.</i>

1771
01:16:33,380 --> 01:16:34,941
<i>It was, it was.
- Wasn't it, really, in the end?</i>

1772
01:16:34,965 --> 01:16:37,176
<i>And I'm really pleased
with the way it turned out.</i>

1773
01:16:37,259 --> 01:16:38,779
<i>- And yeah...
- I was, too, and that's, I mean.</i>

1774
01:16:38,803 --> 01:16:41,430
<i>Yes, I was very happy
with the way it turned out.</i>

1775
01:16:41,514 --> 01:16:43,516
<i>And that's, that's the end of the movie.</i>

1776
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:45,643
<i>- So, we, you know, we hope you enjoyed it.
- Yeah.</i>

1777
01:16:45,726 --> 01:16:48,080
<i>I can only assume that if you're bothering
to listen to the commentary,</i>

1778
01:16:48,104 --> 01:16:50,648
<i>- you probably did.
- Yeah, hope so.</i>

1779
01:16:50,731 --> 01:16:52,858
<i>Here's our last joke.</i>

1780
01:16:52,942 --> 01:16:53,943
I'm home.

1781
01:16:54,026 --> 01:16:55,026
<i>Go on. One more.</i>

1782
01:16:55,069 --> 01:16:58,155
<i>- One more, please.
- "Ambassador, you spoil us".</i>

1783
01:16:59,865 --> 01:17:00,950
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

1784
01:17:01,033 --> 01:17:02,993
<i>- I'm David Bowers, and...
- And I'm Sam Fell.</i>

1785
01:17:03,077 --> 01:17:04,453
<i>- Thanks for listening.
- Bye-bye.</i>

1786
01:17:04,537 --> 01:17:05,537
<i>Bye-bye.</i>
