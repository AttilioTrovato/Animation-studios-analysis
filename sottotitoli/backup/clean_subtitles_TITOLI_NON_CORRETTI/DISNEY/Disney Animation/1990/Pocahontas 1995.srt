Ready to hoist the cannon?
Right! 
Hey, look. Is that Smith?
That's him, all right. The old sea dog.
Captain John Smith. I've heard
some amazing stories about him.
Are you coming on this voyage too?
Of course he is, you halfwit.
You can't fight Indians
without John Smith.
That's right. I'm not about to
let you boys have all the fun.

Haul on the brace!
Come on, come on!
Do your best!
Watch out!
Faster! She's taking on more water!
Look out!
John! Get down here!
The cannons are breaking loose!
Reef the topsails! 
Yes, sir!
Steady on your course.
It's all right, Thomas.
We'll get her tied off.
Say your prayers, men!
Thomas, watch it!
Help!
Man overboard!
Help!
Stay your course! He's lost!
Help!
Pull the pins!
Aye, sir!
Smith! Smith!
Are you crazy?
Hang on, Thomas! I've got you!
Quick! The rope!
Heave!
Come on, lads! Pull!
Pull! Pull!
Pull! Pull!
Put your back into it!
Pull!
Pull!
Hang on!
There, my lucky lads.
Well, that was refreshing.
Well done, Smith.
Of course, you'd all
do the same for me.
Oh, sure, sure. Of course we would.
Sure, yes. Yeah, we would.
Absolutely!
Trouble on deck?
Governor Ratcliffe.
Thomas fell overboard, sir.
Thank heavens he's been
successfully retrieved.
Well done, Smith.
Thank you, sir.
Don't lose heart, men. It won't be
long before we reach the New World.
And remember what awaits us there.
Freedom, prosperity...
the adventure of our lives.
You're the finest crew
England has to offer, and nothing...
Not wind nor rain nor a thousand
bloodthirsty savages...
Shall stand in our way.
Carry on, men!
A stirring oration, sir.
I'm sure the men were most exhilarated.
Let us hope so. I'll need those witless
peasants to dig up my gold, won't I?
This New World's gonna be great, John.
I'm gonna get a pile of gold,
build me a big house...
and if any Indian tries
to stop me, I'll blast him.
You just worry about
that fortune of yours, Thomas.
Leave the savages to me.
You think they'll give us much trouble?
Not as much trouble
as Smith'll give them.
We'll kill ourselves an Injun.
Or maybe two or three.
We're stalwart men and bold
of the Virginia Company.
What do you suppose
the New World will look like?
Like all the others, I suppose.
I've seen hundreds
of new worlds, Thomas.
What could possibly
be different about this one?

Your return has brought

Look at all the smiling faces.
Yes, but there's one
smiling face I don't see.
Where is my daughter?
You know Pocahontas.
She has her mother's spirit.
She goes wherever the wind takes her.
Pocahontas!
Your father's back! Come down here!
He's back, Flit.
Come on, Meeko!
No! Not that way.
Showoff.
Uhoh!
Pocahontas?
Pocahontas! Are you all right?
Well, you better be all right

Don't you think we're getting a...
A little old for these games?
Help me turn this thing over.
What were you doing up there?
Thinking.
Meeko!
About the dream again?
Have you figured it out yet?
I know it means something.
I just don't know what.
You should ask your father about it.
Maybe I should. Come on, Flit.
Quit playing around.
We have to get back.
Faced a determined enemy.
The battle lasted from the rising of the
sun until the evening shadows fell.
Our warriors fought with courage,
but none as bravely as Kocoum...
for he attacked with the
fierce strength of the bear.
He has proven himself to be
the greatest of warriors...
Oh, he is so handsome.
And the finest among us...
Hmph. I especially love his smile.
Destroying every enemy in his path.
Tonight we will feast in his honour.
My daughter.
Winggapao, Father.
Seeing you gives me great joy.
I'm so glad you've come home safely.
Come with me.
We have much to talk about.
I want to hear everything
you've been doing.
Father, for many nights now
I've been having a very strange dream.
I think it's telling me something's
about to happen. Something exciting.
Yes, something exciting
is about to happen.
Really? What is it?
Kocoum has asked to seek
your hand in marriage.
Marry Kocoum?
I told him it would make my heart soar.
But he's so serious.
My daughter, Kocoum will
make a fine husband.
He is loyal and strong and will build
you a good house with sturdy walls.
With him, you will be safe from harm.
Father, I think my dream is
pointing me down another path.
This is the right path for you.
But why can't I choose...
Pocahontas, come with me.
You are the daughter of the chief.
It is time to take your
place among our people.

must someday join the big river.

Is that my Pocahontas?
Grandmother Willow,
I need to talk to you.
Good morning, child.
I was hoping you'd visit today.
Oh! Why, your mother's necklace!
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.
My father wants me to marry Kocoum.
Kocoum? But he's so serious.
I know. My father thinks
it's the right path for me.
But lately, I've been having
this dream and I think it's...
Oh, a dream! Let's hear all about it.
Quiet!
Quiet!
Now, child, you were saying.
Well, I'm running through the woods...
and then, right there in
front of me, is an arrow.
As I look at it, it starts to spin.
A spinning arrow. How unusual.
Yes. It spins faster and faster and
faster until suddenly it stops.
Hmm. Well, it seems to me...
this spinning arrow is
pointing you down your path.
But, Grandmother Willow,
what is my path?
How am I ever going to find it?
Your mother asked me the
very same question.
She did? What did you tell her?
I told her to listen.
All around you are spirits, child.
They live in the earth,
the water, the sky.
If you listen, they will guide you.
I hear the wind.
Yes.
What is it telling you?
I don't understand.

What do you see?
Clouds. Strange clouds.
Look at it, Wiggins. An entire
new world chock full of gold...
just waiting for me.
And scores of adventures waiting for us.
Right, Percy?
Do you think we'll meet some savages?
If we do, we shall be sure...
to give them a proper English greeting.
Ooh, gift baskets.
Oh, no. And he came so
highly recommended.
It's perfect, Governor. The water's deep
enough. We can pull right up to shore.
Hey there, Percy.
Very well, then. Give the order.
Already done, sir.
I've got a crew assembled
and they're ready to go.
About the natives, I'm
counting on you...
to make sure those filthy heathens
don't disrupt our mission.
Well, if they're anything
like the savages I've
fought before, it's
nothing I can't handle.
Right. That'll be all, Smith.
There's a good man.
See you, Percy.
The men like Smith, don't they?
I've never been a popular man.
I like you.
And don't think I don't know what those
back stabbers at court say about me.
Oh, yes, all that talk
about being a pathetic
social climber who's
failed at everything...
He's tried.
I'm very well aware that this
is my last chance for glory.
But mark my words, Wiggins.
When King James
sees the gold these peasants unearth...
success will be mine at last.
Wake up! Shake a leg!
Top off the yardarm!
It's incredible!
And it's all ours. I've
never seen anything like it.
It could look like Ratcliffe's
knickers, for all I care...
just as long as I get
off this stinkin' boat.
Come on, men. We didn't come
all this way just to look at it.
Keep it taut, lads. Keep it taut.
Steady! Steady!
Hold up! That's far enough.
All right, now. Tie her off.
Here, John, tie off this end.
John? John?
What are you doing up there?
Getting a better look.
Hey!
Well. You're a strangelooking fellow.
Are you hungry? Here you go.
Ah, it's a biscuit.
It's food. Well, sort of.
You like it, eh? Well, try eating
it for four months straight.
You got a friend back there?
Hey! Wh... What? Watch out.
What? Get... No, get... Uh, look out.
John, you better get down here.
The governor's coming ashore.
All right. All right. I'm leaving.
Did you see their skin?
They have hair on their faces like dogs.
My brothers, we must know more
about these visitors.
Kekata, what do you see?
These are not men like us...
but strange beasts with bodies
that shine like the sun...
and weapons that spout fire and thunder.
They prowl the Earth
like ravenous wolves...
consuming everything in their path.
Great Powhatan, I will lead our
warriors to the river and attack.
We will destroy these invaders
the way we destroyed the Massawomecks.
Kocoum, in that battle
we knew how to fight our enemy.
But these pale visitors
are strange to us.
Take some men to the river
to observe them.
Let us hope they do not intend to stay.
I hereby claim this land
and all its riches...
in the name of His Majesty
King James the First...
and do so name this
settlement Jamestown.
Bravo! Bravo! Beautifully spoken, sir.
Hurry now, Percy. We must be all
squeaky clean for the New World.
Captain Smith, it appears
I've selected the
perfect location, eh?
Not a savage in sight.
Just because we don't see them
doesn't mean they're not out there, sir.
Well, then perhaps you should venture forth
and determine their whereabouts, hmm?
If there are any Indians
out there, I'll find them.
Now, gentlemen, to work. You
men, get the ship unloaded.
Right, sir.
You men, build the fort.
The rest of you, break out the shovels.
It's time to start digging.
Digging? 
Digging?
Why, of course. Let's
not forget what the
Spanish found when they
came to the New World.
Gold! Mountains of it.

ravaging the New World...

That's it. Keep at it, men.
Keep digging. It's got
to be here somewhere.
There's 30 more of
them down by the ridge.
That makes more than a hundred.
Anything yet?
Nothing but rocks and dirt, sir.
Um, how long are we going to
keep digging like this, sir?
Aye.
We're slaving away, busting our backs
day and night...
for...
For king and country. I know, I know.
And I share your fatigue. Mmm. Wiggins?
Wiggins?
Coming!
Dispose of this.
Who's a good doggy, hmm?
Who's a good doggy?
Fetch, boy!
Savages! It's an ambush!
Arm yourselves!
Run!
Arm yourselves!
Make sure every man has a musket.
Shoot!
Them, you idiot!
Where's that blasted
Smith when I need him?
Namontack!
Back to the village.
Shut up. Shut up, you fools!
They'll be back.
Everyone, back to camp.
Get the rest of the
cannons ashore and finish
building the fort!
Aye, Governor.
And you.
Learn to use that thing properly.
A man's not a man unless
he knows how to shoot.
These beasts invade our
shores, and now this.
This wound is strange to me.
We will fight this enemy, but we cannot
do it alone.
Kocoum, send messengers
to every village in our nation.
We will call on our
brothers to help us fight.
These white men are dangerous.
No one is to go near them.
It's called a helmet.
Helmet.
So, uh, what river is this?
Quiyoughcohannock.
You have the most unusual names here.
Pocahontas.
You have the most unusual name too.
John Smith.
Hey!
Is this bottomless pit
a friend of yours?
Meeko!
Well, how do you do, Meeko?
It's all right. It's just a handshake.
Here, let me show you.
Nothing's happening.
Uh, no, no. I need your hand first.
It's how we say hello.
This is how we say hello.
And how we say goodbye.
I like hello better.
Yeah, I remember you.
Flit just doesn't like strangers.
Well, I'm not a stranger any more.
Hmm. Stubborn little fellow, isn't he?
Very stubborn.
Hey!
Meeko, come back here.
Don't worry. He can't hurt it.
Hey! What are you doing? Get...
Meeko, bring that back!
NNo, it's all right.
He can keep it. Call it a gift.
What was that?
My compass.
Compass?
It tells you how to find
your way when you get lost.
But it's all right.
I'll get another one in London.
London. Is that your village?
Yes.
It's a very big village.
What's it like?
Well, it's got streets filled with
carriages, bridges over the rivers...
and buildings as tall as trees.
I'd like to see those things.
You will.
How?
We're going to build them here.
We'll show your people how to use this
land properly, how to make the most of it.
Make the most of it?
Yes.
We'll build roads and
decent houses and...
Our houses are fine.
You think that only because
you don't know any better.
WWait a minute.
Don't take it tha... Hey. Hey!
Wait! WaWait!
There's so much we can teach you.

Savages?
Uh, not that you're a savage.
Just my people.
No. Listen. That's not what I meant.
Let me explain, uh...
Let go!
No, I'm not letting you leave.
Look, don't do this.
Savage is just a word, uh, you know.

They mean trouble. I shouldn't be here.
I want to see you again.
I can't.
Please, don't leave.
I'm sorry.
I have to go.
All right! This one's ready to hoist!
Two on each side.
Ready now. Push!
Watch it. It's slippery.
Come on, lads. It's only
a little picket fence.
Steady. Steady.
There you go.
That'll keep everything out, eh, John?
Something wrong, John?
What?
You've been awfully quiet
the last few days.
Oh, he's just mad that he
missed all the action.
Ah, don't worry, John. You'll get
your chance to deal with the Indians.
Yeah, we'll take care of them
like we did last time, eh, mates?
We shot ourselves an Injun
or maybe two or three.
All right, you howling
nutter, get to work!
Come on, Ben. It's just a little fun.
Oh, sure, we're having
loads of fun, right?
Look at us. No gold, no food.
While Ratcliffe sits up in his
tent all day, happy as a clam.
I am doomed!
I should be wallowing in riches by now
and I haven't found as much as a speck!
Think. Think!
It's got to be around here somewhere.
Where could it be?
I've mined the forests and
the hills and the swamps.
And nothing!
Why can't I find it?
What am I overlooking?
I... I...
I made it myself.
Take that silly...
Of course! The Indians.
Wiggins, why do you think those
insolent heathens attacked us?
Because we invaded their land and cut
down their trees and dug up their earth?
It's the gold! They have it and they
don't want us to take it from them.
Well, I'll just have to take it
by force, then, won't I?
You there! Where's Captain Smith?
Well, he's gone.
Aye. Your singing must
have scared them off.
Well, then go get
him, for heaven's sake!
What if we run into the Indians?
That's what guns are for.
Now arm yourselves and get moving!
Pocahontas.
You should be inside the village.
We'll be all right.
We're gathering food for
when the warriors arrive.
Don't go far. Now is not
the time to be running off.
Yes, Father.
When I see you wear that necklace...
you look just like your mother.
I miss her.
But she is still with us.
Whenever the wind moves through
the trees, I feel her presence.
Our people looked to her
for wisdom and strength.
Someday, they will look to you as well.
I would be honoured by that.
You shouldn't be out here alone.
I'll send for Kocoum.
All right. What is it?
What?
You're hiding something.
I'm not hiding anything.
Pocahontas, you can tell me.
I promise I won't tell anyone.
Pocahontas, look!
It's one of them! I'm going to get...
What are you doing here?
I had to see you again.
Huh?
Pocahontas. Pocahontas?
Please, don't say anything.
Quick, this way.
But...
Nakoma. Huh?
Where is Pocahontas?
I... I haven't seen her.
Pocahontas can't keep running off.
It's dangerous out there.
Tell her that. She listens to you.
Huh. Sure she does.
This place is incredible.
And to think we came all this
way just to dig it up for gold.
Gold?
Hey, Meeko.
What's gold?
You know, it's, uh...
it's, it's yellow.
It comes out of the ground.
It's really valuable.
Oh! Here, we have lots of it. Gold.
No. Gold is this.
Hmm. There's nothing
like that around here.
No gold.
Not that I've seen.
All this way for nothing. Well, those
boys are in for a big surprise.
Will they leave?
Some of them might.
Will you go home?
Well, it's not like I have
much of a home to go back to.
I've never really belonged anywhere.
You could belong here.
What was that?
Did you see something?
No. No. I just, uh... I...
I didn't see anything, did I?
Look again.
♪ Let it break upon you. ♪
♪ Like a wave upon the sand. ♪
Hello, John Smith.
Pocahontas, that tree is talking to me.
Then you should talk back.
Don't be frightened, young man.
My bark is worse than my bite.
Say something.
What do you say to a tree?
Anything you want.
So, uh...
Come closer, John Smith.
He has a good soul. And
he's handsome too.
Oh, I like her.
I knew you would.
Smith! Smith! Where are you, mate?
We can't let them see us.
Quick! Over here.
This place gives me the creeps.
Savages could be hiding anywhere.
Aye. Well, if you spot
one, don't ask questions.
Just shoot.
Watch your feet, you big oaf!
It wasn't me. It was the tree.
Oh, of course! The tree
just felt like lifting its roots and...
Let's get out of here.
Ow!
Ow! Run!
But what about Smith?
He's a big lad. He can
take care of himself.
I'm glad you're on our side.
There's still some
snap in these old vines.
I'd better get back before
they send the whole camp out after me.
When will I see you again?
Meet me tonight. Right here.
Well, I haven't had this much
excitement in 200 years.
What am I doing? I
shouldn't be seeing him again.
I mean, I want to see him again.
Who wouldn't? I want to see him again.
But still, something inside is
telling me it's the right thing.
Perhaps it's your dream.
My dream?
Do you think he's the one the
spinning arrow was pointing to?
Hmm.
The warriors are here!
Pocahontas, are you crazy?
What were you doing with one of them?
There you are.
Kocoum. Look at them.
Now we have enough warriors
to destroy those white demons.
Now that we are joined
by our brothers...
we will defeat this enemy.
Father, I need to speak with you.
Not now, my daughter.
The council is gathering.
We don't have to fight them!
There must be a better way.
Sometimes our paths are chosen for us.
But maybe we should
try talking to them.
They do not want to talk.
But if one of them did want to talk,
you would listen to him, wouldn't you?
Pocahontas.
Wouldn't you?
Of course I would. But
it is not that simple.
Nothing is simple any more.
Easy, Thomas. It's me.
Oh, John. I could've killed you.
Not aiming like that, you couldn't.
Keep both eyes open when you shoot.
You'll see twice as well.
Smith, there you are!
We were looking all over for you.
Smith! Where have you been?
I was out scouting the terrain, sir.
Excellent. Then you must know
the Indians' whereabouts.
We'll need that
information for the battle.
What battle?
We will eliminate these
savages once and for all.
No! You can't do that.
Oh, can't I?
Look, we don't have to fight them.
John, what's gotten into you?
I met one of them.
You what?
A savage?
They're not savages. They can help us.
They know the land.
They know how to navigate the rivers.
And look. It's food.
What is it?
It's better than hardtack
and gruel, that's for sure.
I like gruel.
They don't want to feed us, you ninnies!
They want to kill us, all of us!
They've got our gold, and
they'll do anything to keep it!
But there is no gold.
No gold?
And I suppose your little
Indian friend told you this?
Yes.
Lies! Lies! All of it!
Murderous thieves! There's no room
for their kind in civilized society.
But this is their land!
This is my land! I make the laws here.
And I say anyone who so much
as looks at an Indian...
without killing him on sight
will be tried for treason...
and hanged!
Pocahontas!
Nakoma!
Don't go out there.
I lied for you once.
Don't ask me to do it again.
I have to do this.
He's one of them.
You don't know him.
If you go out there, you'll be turning
your back on your own people.
I'm trying to help my people.
Pocahontas, please.
You're my best friend.
I don't want you to get hurt.
I won't.
I know what I'm doing.
Pocahontas, no!
Ratcliffe wouldn't take us
halfway around the world for nothin'.
But what if Smith is right?
What if there is no gold?
If you ask me, Ratcliffe's been
lying to us since we left London.
Listen to you, ya bunch of idiots.
Those savages didn't attack us for
nothin'. They're hidin' somethin'.
If they do have the gold,
I reckon we'll have to fight 'em.
Not me.
Either too hot or too cool.
I haven't been comfortable
since we got here.
Oh, I know. I've been itching a lot.
Follow him.
Yes, Governor.
I want to know where
he's sneaking off to.
Yes, sir.
And if you happen to see
any Indians, shoot them.
Oh, and Thomas, you've been a slipshod
sailor and a poor excuse for a soldier.
Don't disappoint me again.
Kocoum.
What is it?
It's Pocahontas.
What's wrong? Is she all right?
I think she's in trouble.
The Earth is trembling, child.
What's happened?
The warriors are here!
Pocahontas!
John.
Listen to me. My men are
planning to attack your people.
You've got to warn them.
Maybe it's not too late to stop this.
You have to come with me
and talk to my father.
Pocahontas, talking isn't
going to do any good.
I already tried talking to my men,
but everything about this
land has them spooked.
That's the strangest creature
I've ever seen.
Percy.
Easy, Percy. Come here!
Meeko, come back!
You see what I mean? Once two sides
want to fight, nothing can stop them.
Come... Come here, both of you!
It's all right! It's all right!
He's a friend!
Bad! Bad dog! Sit!
What are you doing? Meeko!
Percy, get back here!
What are you doing? Stop that!
All right, that's enough!
It's enough to make your sap boil.
Now then, there's something
I want to show you. Look.
The ripples.
What about them?
So small at first, then
look how they grow.
But someone has to start them.
They're not going to listen to us.
Young man, sometimes the right
path is not the easiest one.
Don't you see?
Only when the fighting
stops can you be together.
All right. Let's go talk to your father.
No!
Kocoum! No!
Kocoum!
Leave him alone!
Kocoum! Stop!
Both eyes open.
Thomas!
Is he...
You killed him.
I thought that...
Get away from him!
Pocahontas, it won't help!
He was only...
He killed him!
Thomas, get out of here!
Get out of here!
Who did this?
Pocahontas was out in the woods.
Kocoum went to find her
and this white man attacked him.
Your weapons are strong,
but now our anger is stronger.
At sunrise he will be the first to die.
But, Father...
I told you to stay in the village.
You disobeyed me. You
have shamed your father!
I was only trying to help.
Because of your foolishness,
Kocoum is dead!
Take him away!
Kocoum was just coming to protect me.
Pocahontas, I sent Kocoum after you.
I was worried about you.
II thought I was doing the right thing.
All this happened because of me.
And now I'll never see John Smith again.
Come with me.
Pocahontas wants to look into the eyes
of the man who killed Kocoum.
Be quick.
Pocahontas.
I'm so sorry.
For what, this?
I've gotten out of worse
scrapes than this.
Can't think of any right now, but...
It would've been better if we'd never
met. None of this would've happened.
Pocahontas, look at me.
I'd rather die tomorrow...
than live a hundred years
without knowing you.
Pocahontas.
I can't leave you.
You never will.
No matter what happens to me,
I'll always be with you. Forever.
Help! Somebody help! Help! Help!
Easy, lad. What is it?
It's Smith! They got him!
Who got him?
The savages!
Savages?
They captured him, dragged him off!
Where'd they take him?
They headed north.
How many were there?
I don't know. At least a dozen.
Filthy beasts!
Ratcliffe was right!
It's perfect, Wiggins. I couldn't
have planned this better myself.
The gold is as good as mine.
We've got to save him!
He'd do the same for any of us!
Thomas is right! We've
got to do somethin'!
And so we shall.
I told you those savages
couldn't be trusted.
That's right!
Smith tried to befriend them,
and look what they've done to him!
Yeah, that's right.
But now I say it's time to
rescue our courageous comrade.
At daybreak, we attack!

You have to stop them.
I can't.
Child, remember your dream.
I was wrong, Grandmother Willow.
I followed the wrong path.
I feel so lost.
The compass?
Spinning arrow.
It's the arrow from your dream.
I was right! It was pointing to him.
Sunrise.
It's not too late, child.
Let the spirits of the Earth guide you.

If you kill him, you'll
have to kill me too.
Daughter, stand back.
I won't! I love him, Father.
What?
Look around you. This is where the
path of hatred has brought us.
This is the path I choose,
Father. What will yours be?
My daughter speaks with
a wisdom beyond her years.
We have all come here with
anger in our hearts...
but she comes with courage
and understanding.
From this day forward,
if there is to be more killing...
it will not start with me.
Release him.
Now's our chance! Fire!
No!
What?
They let him go.
They don't want to fight.
It's a trick! Don't you see? Fire!
Fine. I'll settle this myself.
No!
John!
You shot him!
He stepped right... right into it.
It's his own fault.
Smith was right all along.
We never should've listened to you.
Get the gun!
Traitors!
Unhand me, I say! How dare you!
Put him in chains!
I'll see you all hanged for this!
And gag him as well!
Is he gonna make it, Thomas?
The sooner he gets back
to England, the better.
Well, let's hope the wind is with him.
Is the ship ready yet?
Any minute now. Just loadin'
the last bit of cargo.
How dare you! Untie me at once!
I'll have your heads for this!
And he came so highly recommended.
The ship's almost ready. We'd better
get you on board. We'll lose the tide.
No, not yet.
She said she'd be here.
Look.
Going back is his only chance.
He'll die if he stays here.
Here. It's from Grandmother
Willow's bark.
It'll help with the pain.
What pain? I've had
worse pain than this.
Can't think of any right now, but...
You are always welcome among our people.
Thank you, my brother.
I thought you didn't like strangers.
My mother's necklace.
See ya, Percy.
Come with me?
You must choose your own path.
I'm needed here.
Then I'll stay with you.
No. You have to go back.
But I can't leave you.
You never will.
No matter what happens,
I'll always be with you.
Forever.
Good luck, lad.
Godspeed, John.
The crew aready?
Aye, sir!
Set the mainsails!
Weigh anchor!
