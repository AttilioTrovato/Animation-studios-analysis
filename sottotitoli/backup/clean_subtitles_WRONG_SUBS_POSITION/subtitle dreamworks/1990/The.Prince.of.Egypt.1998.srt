Mud and lift 
Sand and pull

Faster!
With the sting of the whip 
on my shoulder 
With the salt of my sweat
on my brow 
Elohim, God on high 
Can you hear your people cry? 
Help us now this dark hour 
Deliver us 
Hear our call, deliver us 
Lord of all, remember us 
Here in this burning sand 
Deliver us 
There's a land you promised us 
Deliver us 
To the Promised Land 


My son, I have nothing
I can give 
But this chance that you
may live 
I pray we'll meet again 
If He will deliver us 
Deliver us 
Hear our prayer
Deliver us from despair 
These years of slavery
Grow too cruel to stand 
Deliver us 
There's a land you promised us 
Deliver us 
Out of bondage 
And deliver us 
To the Promised Land 



Hush now, my baby 
Be still, love, don't cry 
Sleep as you're rocked
by the stream 
Sleep and remember 
My last lullaby 
So I'll be with you 
When you dream 

River, oh, river 
Flow gently for me 
Such precious cargo you bear 
Do you know somewhere 
He can live free? 
River, deliver him there 









Brother, you're safe now 
And safe may you stay 
For I have a prayer
just for you 
Grow, baby brother 
Come back someday 
Come and deliver us too 

Mommy.
Come, Rameses.
We will show Pharaoh
your new baby brother.
Moses.

Deliver us 
Send a shepherd
to shepherd us 
And deliver us 
To the Promised Land 
Deliver us 
To the Promised Land 
Deliver us 

Haha!
Faster, you beasts!
You run like mules!
Hey, Rameses,
how would you like
your face carved on a wall?
Someday, yes.
How about now?


You almost killed me!
Aw, come on.
Where is your sense of fun?
Oh, it's fun you want.







Moses?






Come on, Moses. Admit it.
You've always looked up to me.
Yes, but it's not
much of a view.

Hyah!


Hey!
Second born,
second place.
Not for long.







Jump!







You don't think
we'll get in trouble
for this, do you?
No, not a chance.
Why do the gods
torment me
with such reckless,
destructive,
blasphemous sons?
Father,
hear what I...
Be still! Pharaoh speaks.
I seek to build an empire,
and your only thought
is to amuse yourselves
by tearing it down.
Have I taught you nothing?
You mustn't be
so hard on yourself,
Your Majesty.
You're an
excellent teacher.
It's not your fault
your sons learned nothing.
Well, they
learned blasphemy.
True.
Father, the fault is mine.
I goaded Rameses on,
and so I am responsible.
Hmm. "Responsible."
And do you know the meaning
of that word, Rameses?
I understand, Father...
And do you
understand the task
for which your birth
has destined you?
The ancient traditions.
When I pass into
the next world,
then you will be
the morning and evening star.
One damaged temple
does not destroy
centuries of tradition.
But one weak link
can break the chain
of a mighty dynasty!

You have my leave to go.
Father.
Father?
You know it was
really my fault.
Must you be so hard on him?
Moses, you will never
have to carry a burden
like the crown I will pass
to Rameses.
He must not allow himself
to be led astray,
not even by you, my son.
All he cares about
is your approval.
I know he will live up
to your expectations.
He only needs
the opportunity.
Maybe.
Maybe so.
Go now.
I shall see you both tonight.

Well, that went well.
Just go away.
Could have been worse.
"The weak link
in the chain."
That's what he called me.

Well, you are rather pathetic.
Irresponsible,
ignorant of the traditions.
He practically accused me
of bringing down the dynasty.
Yeah, I can see it now.
There go the pyramids!

You can laugh about it.
Statues cracking
and toppling over,
the Nile drying up.
Singlehandedly,
you will manage to bring
the greatest kingdom
on Earth to ruin.
Tell me this, Moses.
Tell me this.
Why is it that every time
you start something,
I'm the one who
ends up in trouble?


Man! Oh!
It's Rameses.
You're in trouble,
young man.
Rameses, get down here!
I think you owe us
an apology!
Oh!
My new thing!
I am so upset!
You might as well.
You'll pay for this!
We're gonna
tell the pharaoh!
We're telling
the pharaoh and that's...
Oh!
Look at me.
I'm drenched again.
Hey, I figured it out.
You know what your
problem is, Rameses?
What?
You care too much.
And your problem is
you don't care at all.
Oh, in that case,
I suppose you care
a lot more than I do
that we're late
for the banquet,
for example.

I'm done for.
Father will kill me.
Don't worry.
Nobody will even
notice us coming in.

"Nobody will even notice."

Ah, the young princes.
Rameses, you were just named
Prince regent.
You are now responsible
for overseeing
all the temples.
I suggest you get over there,
and thank your father.
Apparently, Moses,
someone thought he just
needed the opportunity.
My lord Pharaoh,
I propose that
the high priests
offer tribute
to their new regent.
An excellent idea.
Hotep, Huy!
Huy.
Hmm?
The Midian girl.
That's a good idea.
Go get her.
By the power of Ra,
we present for your
delectation and delight
an exotic apparition
stolen from a faraway land.



We offer you
this delicate desert flower.




Let us inspect
this desert flower.


More like
a desert cobra.

Not much of a snake charmer,
are you?
That's why I give her to you.
No, no, no,
that's generous, but...
I won't be
given to anyone.
Especially an arrogant,
pampered palace brat!
Are you gonna
let her talk to you like that?

You will show
the proper respect
for a Prince of Egypt.
But I am showing you
all the respect you deserve.
None!
No. Wait!
Be still.
Untie this rope!
I demand you set me free!
Be still.
Let go!
As you wish.




You there,
have her dried off
and sent to
Prince Moses' chambers.

If it pleases you, Father,
my first act as regent
is to appoint Moses
as royal chief architect.


Uh...
Well. 
Right.





Shh.
Come on.


Guards.
Prince Moses.
Uh...
There is a man
tied up in my room.
Well, look into it.
Right away, sire.

Please,
I need water.
I have a long journey
ahead of me.
May God protect you.
Thank you.



Oh! Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry. I...
Oh, please forgive me. I...

I didn't expect
to see you here,
of all places, at our door.
Mmm.
At last!
"At last"?
Didn't I tell you, Aaron?
Didn't I tell you?
I knew he would return to us
when he was ready.
Miriam, do you
want us flogged?
I knew you cared
about our freedom.
Miriam.
"Freedom"? Why would I
care about that?
Because you're...
You're our brother.
What?
They...

They never told you?
Who never told me what?
But you're here.
You must know.
Be careful, slave.
Oh, my good Prince.
Um, she's...
She's exhausted
from the day's work.
Uh, not that it was too much.
We... We quite enjoyed it.
But she's confused,
and knows not
to whom she speaks.
I know to whom I speak, Aaron.
I know who you are.
And you are not
a Prince of Egypt.
Miriam.
What did you say?
Your Highness,
pay her no heed.
Come, Miriam. May I discuss
something with you?
No, Aaron.
No. Please, Moses,
you must believe.
That's enough.
You were born of
my mother, Yocheved.
Stop it.
You are our brother!
Now, you go too far.
You shall be punished.
No.
Please, uh, Your Highness.
She's ill. She's very ill.
We beg your forgiveness.
Please, Miriam,
let us go.
No, Aaron.
Our mother set you adrift in
a basket to save your life!
Save my life? From who?
Ask the man that
you call Father.
How dare you?
God saved you
to be our deliverer.
Enough of this.
And you are, Moses.
You are the deliverer.
I said enough!

You will regret this night.


Hush now, my baby 
Be still, love, don't cry 
Sleep as you're rocked
by the stream 
Sleep and remember 
My last lullaby 
So I'll be with you 
When you dream 

Stop him.

Did you see him?
It's Moses.
Moses.



Gleaming in the moonlight 

Cool and clean
and all I've ever known 
All I ever wanted 
Sweet perfumes of incense 
And graceful rooms
of alabaster stone 
All I ever wanted 
This is my home 
With my father
Mother, brother 
Oh, so noble, oh, so strong 
Now I am home 
Here among my trappings
and belongings I belong 
And if anybody doubts it 
They couldn't be more wrong 
I am a sovereign Prince
of Egypt 
A son of the proud history
that's shown 
Etched on every wall 
Surely this is
all I ever wanted 
All I ever wanted 
All I ever wanted 







The Hebrews grew
too numerous.
They might have
risen against us.
Father, tell me
you didn't do this.
Moses, sometimes,
for the greater good,
sacrifices must be made.

"Sacrifices"?
Oh, my son.
They were only slaves.

Moses?
Is this where you found me?
Moses, please try
to understand.
So... So everything I thought,
everything I am, is a lie.
No.
You are our son,
and we love you.
Why did you choose me?
We didn't, Moses.
The gods did.


This is your home, my son 
Here the river brought you 
And it's here the river meant 
To be your home 
Now you know the truth, love 
Now forget and be content 
When the gods
send you a blessing 
You don't ask
why it was sent 
Last night, the gods
granted me a vision.
I'm not merely going to
restore this temple.
I will make it more grand,
more splendid than
any other monument
in upper or lower Egypt.
I'll make you...






Moses. Look,
fate has turned our
little misadventure
into a great opportunity.
Get up, old man.
I know Father
will be so pleased
with what you and I...
Put your back into it!
Faster!
And this is
just the beginning.
A gateway will open
to an entire new city
of white limestone,
more dazzling than the sun.
And here, a statue of Hapi...

I said, hurry!
...god of the Nile flanked by
two great columned halls.
Stop it!
Miriam, no.
Somebody's got to stop this.
There's nothing
that we can do.



Let's raise
the roof over here...


Stop it. Stop.
Stop it. Leave that man alone!
Moses.

Out of my way.
Out of my way. Move!

Who did this?
Up there.
It's him. Up there.



Moses.

Moses, what's going on?

Moses!
Moses!
Moses.
Let me go!
No, wait.
You saw what happened.
I just killed a man.
We can take care of that.
I will make it so
it never happened.
Nothing you can say
can change what I've done.
I am Egypt,
the morning
and the evening star.
If I say day is night,
it will be written,
and you will be what
I say you are.
I say you are innocent.
What you say does not matter.
You don't understand.
I can't stay here any longer.
Moses...
No! All I've ever known
to be true is a lie.

I'm not who you think I am.
What are you talking about?
Go ask the man
I once called Father.
Moses?
Please.
Goodbye, brother.
Moses!
Moses!

No.








Hey, wait.
Please.




What are you doing?
Help! Stop!
Let our sheep drink!
Go away!
Leave us alone!
Get away from me!
Leave us alone!
Get away!
Stop it!
Stop it!
We'll do what we want.
My father's
the high priest of Midian...
Get away!
...and you'll be
in big trouble.


Hey, you.
Aren't these your camels?
Huthut.
No, no.
No, no, wait!
No!
Wait, stop!
No!




What are
you girls doing?
We're trying to
get the funny man
out of the well.
Trying to get the funny man
out of the well.
Well, that's one
I've never heard before.


Oh, my. Oh...
Don't worry down there.
We'll get you out. Hold on.

You.
Huh?



Mmmhmm.
That's why Papa says
she'll never get married.

You don't have to do this.
Ladies, please, I'm really...
I'm really quite...
No, not there, please.

That tickles.
Ladies, you've cleaned
every inch of me.
Whoa! I... I was wrong.

Let me through.
Let me through.
I want to see him.
Ah!
You are most welcome.

You should not be a stranger
in this land.
You have been sent
as a blessing.
And tonight,

you shall be
my honored guest.

My father,
Jethro, High Priest of Midian.

Psst.
Sit with me.
All right.
Psst.
Not yet.
Oh, sorry.
My children,
let us give thanks
for this bountiful food.
And let us also give thanks
for the presence
of this brave young man
whom we honor here tonight.

Please, sir,
I wish you wouldn't.
I've done nothing in my life
worth honoring.
First, you rescue
Tzipporah from Egypt,
then you defend
my younger daughters
from brigands.

You think that is nothing?
It seems you do not know
what is worthy of honor.



A single thread in a tapestry 
Though its color
brightly shine 
Can never see its purpose 
In a pattern of
the grand design 
And the stone that sits
on the very top 
Of the mountain's mighty face 
Does it think
it's more important 
Than the stones
that form the base? 
So how can you see
What your life is worth 
Or where your value lies 
You can never see
through the eyes of man 
You must look at your life 
Look at your life
through heaven's eyes 

Dance with me.
No, I don't know how.
A lake of gold
in the desert sand 
Is less than
a cool, fresh spring 
And to one lost sheep
a shepherd boy 
Is greater
than the richest king 
If a man lose
everything he owns 
Has he truly lost his worth? 
Or is it the beginning 
Of a new and brighter birth 
So how do you measure
the worth of a man 
In wealth or strength
or size 
In how much he gained
or how much he gave? 
The answer will come 
The answer will come to him
who tries 
To look at his life
through heaven's eyes 
And that's why we share
all we have with you 
Though there's little
to be found 
When all you've got is nothing 
There's a lot to go around 
No life can escape
being blown about 
By the winds of change
and chance 
And though you never know
All the steps 
Dance with me.
No, I... No.
You must learn
to join the dance 
You must learn
to join the dance 


So how do you judge
what a man is worth 
By what he builds or buys 
You can never see
with your eyes on Earth 
Look through heaven's eyes 
Look at your life 
Look at your life 
Look at your life
through heaven's eyes 

I love you.





It's too early for this.

Moses. 
Moses. 
Moses. 
Moses. 
Here I am.
Take the sandals 
from your feet, 
for the place
on which you stand
is holy ground. 

Who are you?
I am that I am. 
I don't understand.
I am the God
of your ancestors, 
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. 
You were born
of my mother, Yocheved. 
You are our brother. 
What do you want with me?
I have seen 
the oppression of 
my people in Egypt 
and have heard their cry. 
Stop it!
Leave that man alone! 
So I have come down 
to deliver them
out of slavery, 
and bring them to a good land, 
a land flowing with milk
and honey. 
And so, unto Pharaoh, 
I shall send you. 
Me? Who am I to
lead these people?
They'll never believe me.
They won't even listen.
I shall teach you
what to say. 
Let my people go! 
But I was their enemy.
I was the Prince of Egypt,
the son of the man who
slaughtered their children.
You've... You've chosen
the wrong messenger.
How can I even speak
to these people?

Who made man's mouth? 
Who made the deaf, the mute,
the seeing or the blind? 
Did not I? 
Now go! 

Oh, Moses, 
I shall be with you when
you go to the King of Egypt. 
But Pharaoh will not listen. 
So I will stretch out my hand, 
and smite Egypt
with all my wonders. 
Take the staff
in your hand, Moses. 
With it, you shall
do my wonders. 
I shall be with you, Moses. 
Moses. 
Moses. 


But, Moses,
you are just one man.
Tzipporah.
Please.



Look at your family.
They are free.
They have a future.
They have hopes and dreams,
and the promise
of a life with dignity.
That is what I want
for my people.
And that is why
I must do the task
that God has given me.
I'm coming with you.





Rameses.
Moses?
Is it really?


Moses, where have you been?
Rameses.
I took you for dead.

Look at you.
Pharaoh.
Well, look at you.
What on Earth
are you dressed as?

Oh, Rameses,
it's so good to see you.
Excuse me, uh,
Your Majesty.
We are compelled to
remind you that this man
committed a serious crime
against the gods.
We are loathe to
bring it up, mind you.
Yet the law
clearly states
the punishment
for such a crime...
Death.
We hesitate to say it.
Be still.
Pharaoh speaks.
I am the morning
and the evening star.
Rameses.
It shall be as I say.
I pardon forever all crimes
of which he stands accused,
and will have it known
that he is
our brother Moses,
the Prince of Egypt.

Rameses.
In my heart,
you are my brother,
but things cannot be
as they were.
I see no reason why not.
You know I am a Hebrew,
and the God of the Hebrews
came to me.
What?
He commands that you
let His people go.

Commands?
Behold,
the power of God.




Well, impressive, but... Mmm.
Very well, Moses.
I'll play along.
Hotep. Huy.
Give this snake charmer
our answer.

They love it.
All right, Moses.
I know you.
What's this really about?
Rameses,
look.
What do you see?
A greater Egypt
than that of my father.
That is not what I see.

Moses, I cannot change
what you see.
I have to maintain
the ancient traditions.
I bear the weight
of my father's crown.
Do you still not understand
what Seti was?
He was a great leader.
His hands bore the blood
of thousands of children.
Slaves.
My people.
And I can no longer
hide in the desert
while they suffer
at your hands.
So,
you have returned
only to free them.
I'm sorry.
Yes.
I had hoped, but...
I do not know this god.
Neither will I let
your people go.
Rameses, please,
you must listen...
I will not be the weak link.
Tell your people, as of today,
their workload
has been doubled,
thanks to your god.
Or is it thanks
to you?
It's Moses.

Moses.
So, Moses, how does it feel
when you get struck
to the ground?
I didn't mean to
cause you more pain.
I'm just trying to do
as God told me.
God?
When did God start caring
about any of us?
In fact, Moses, when did you
start caring about slaves?
Was it when you found out
that you were one of us?
Don't listen to him.
No, he's... He's right.
I did not see because I
did not wish to see.
Oh, you didn't see because
you didn't wish to see.
Ah.
Well, that makes everything
fine then, doesn't it?
Aaron, you shame yourself.
Miriam.
I'm so sorry.


Moses,
hear what I say.
I have been a slave
all my life,
and God has never answered
my prayers until now.
God saved you
from the river,
He saved you in
all your wanderings,
and even now,
He saves you from
the wrath of Pharaoh.
God will not abandon you.
So don't you abandon us.

Miriam, where are you going?
Miriam.
The ball disappears.
Now, where is it?
It's in his hand.
How about that?

Rameses!
Let my people go!

Still gnawing away
at that bone, are we?
Carry on.
You cannot keep ignoring us.
Enough. I will hear no more
of this Hebrew nonsense.
Bring him to me.
Moses!
No!
Take the staff
in your hand, Moses. 
Father.
It's...
Blood!
Blood! Blood!


Hotep, Huy.
Explain this to me.
Ah...
Rest assured, Your Majesty.
Yes, we were going to
demonstrate the superior
might of our gods.
Uh...
By the power of Ra.


Abandon this
futile mission, Moses.
I've indulged you long enough.
This must now be finished.
No, Rameses.
It is only beginning.
But, Moses,
didn't you see
what happened?
The priests did
the same thing.
Pharaoh still has the power
over our lives.
Yes, Aaron, it's true.
Pharaoh has the power.
He can take away your food,
your home, your freedom.
He can take away your sons
and daughters.
With one word,
Pharaoh can take away
your very lives.
But there is one thing
he cannot take away from you.
Your faith.
Believe,
for we will see God's wonders.


Thus saith the Lord 
Thus saith the Lord 
Since you refuse
to free my people
Since you refuse 
Since you refuse
to free my people 
All through the land of Egypt 
I send a pestilence, a plague
into your house, into your bed 
Into your streams
Into your streets 
Into your drink
Into your bread 
Upon your cattle
On your sheep 
Upon your oxen in your field 
Into your dreams
Into your sleep 
Until you break
Until you yield 
I send the swarm
I send the horde 
Thus saith the Lord 
Once I called you brother 
Once I thought the chance
to make you laugh 
Was all I ever wanted 
I send the thunder 
from the sky 
I send the fire raining down 
And even now I wish 
that God had chose another 
Serving as your foe
on his behalf 
Is the last thing
that I wanted 
I send a hail of burning ice 
on every field, on every town 
This was my home 
All this pain and devastation 
How it tortures me inside 
All the innocent who suffer 
From your stubbornness
and pride 
I send the locusts on the wind 
Such as the world
has never seen 
On every leaf, on every stalk 
Until there's nothing left
of green 
I send my scourge 
I send my sword 
Thus saith the Lord 
You who I called brother 
Why must you call down
another blow 
I send my scourge 
I send my sword 
Let my people go 
Thus saith the Lord 
Thus saith the Lord 
You who I called brother 
How could you have come
to hate me so 
Is this what you wanted? 
I sent the swarm 
I sent the horde 
Then let my heart be hardened 
And never mind
how high the cost may grow 
This will still be so 
I will never let
your people go 
Thus saith the Lord 
Thus saith the Lord 
I will not let your people go 
Let my people go 
Rameses?
Rameses?
Oh. Let me guess.
You want me to
let your people go.
I hoped I would find you here.
Get out.

Rameses, we must
bring this to an end.
Rameses, please, talk to me.
We could always talk here.

This place.
So many memories.
I remember the time you
switched the heads of the gods
of the Temple of Ra.
Ah.
If I
recall correctly,
you were there switching heads
right along with me.
No, it was you.
I didn't do that.
Oh, yes, you did.
You put the hippo
on the crocodile,
and the crocodile...
On the falcon.
Yes.
And the priest thought
it was a horrible omen,
and fasted for two months.
Father was furious.
You were always getting me
into trouble.
But then...

You were always there to
get me out of trouble again.

Why can't things be
the way they were before?
Father.
It's so dark.

I'm frightened.
Why is he here?
Isn't that the man
who did all this?
Yes.
But one must wonder
why?
Because no kingdom should be
made on the backs of slaves.
Rameses, your stubbornness
is bringing this misery
upon Egypt.
It would cease if only you
would let the Hebrews go.
I will not be dictated to.
I will not be threatened.
I am the morning
and the evening star.
I am Pharaoh.
Something else is coming.
Something much worse
than anything before.
Please, let go
of your contempt for life
before it destroys everything
you hold dear.
Think of your son.
I do.
You Hebrews have been
nothing but trouble.
My father had the right idea
about how to deal
with your people.
Rameses...
And I think it's time
I finished the job.
Rameses.
And there shall be
a great cry in all of Egypt,
such as never has been
or ever will be again.

Rameses, you bring this
upon yourself.
God has come to me again, 
saying, "Take a lamb 
"and with its blood, 
"mark the lintel
and posts of every door. 
"For tonight, I shall
pass through the land
of Egypt 
"and smite all the firstborn. 
"But when I see the blood
upon your door,
"I will pass over you
"and the plague
shall not enter."










You and your people
have my permission to go.
Leave me!




Many nights we've prayed 
With no proof
anyone could hear 
In our hearts a hopeful song 
We barely understood 
Now we are not afraid 
Although we know
there's much to fear 
We were moving mountains 
Long before we knew we could 
There can be miracles 
When you believe 
Though hope is frail 
It's hard to kill 
Who knows what miracles 
You can achieve 
When you believe 
Somehow you will 
You will when you believe 
In this time of fear 
When prayers so often
proved in vain 
Hope seemed like
the summer birds 
Too swiftly flown away 
Yet now I'm standing here
Now I'm standing here 
With heart so full
I can't explain 
Seeking faith 
and speaking words 
I never thought I'd say 
There can be miracles 
When you believe 
When you believe 
Though hope is frail 
It's hard to kill 
It's hard to kill 
Who knows what miracles 
You can achieve 
You can achieve 
When you believe 
Somehow you will 
You will when you believe 





There can be miracles 
When you believe 
Though hope is frail 
It's hard to kill 
It's hard to kill 
Who knows what miracles 
You can achieve 
You can achieve 
When you believe 
Somehow you will 
Now you will 
You will when you believe 
When you believe 
You will when you 
Believe 











With this staff, 
you shall do 
my wonders! 



Leave it!



Yeah, me too.







Don't just stand there!
Kill them!

Kill them all!
The soldiers! They're coming!


Moses! Moses!
Hurry! Hurry! I got you.
Look! The shore!




No!



Thank you.

Moses!
Moses!

Goodbye, brother.

Look.
Look at your people, Moses.

They are free.
Deliver us
