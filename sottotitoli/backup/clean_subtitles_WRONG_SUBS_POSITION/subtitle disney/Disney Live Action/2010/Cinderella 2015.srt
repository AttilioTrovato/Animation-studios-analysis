Once upon a time,
there was a girl called Ella.
And she saw the world
not always as it was,
but as perhaps it could be,
with just a little bit of magic.
Ah, my darling!
To her mother and father, she was a princess.
True, she had no title,
nor crown, nor castle,
but she was the ruler
of her own little kingdom,
whose borders were the house 
and meadow on the forest's edge
where her people
had lived for generations.
With Mr. Goose...
and all their animal family.
Hello, there.
What do you think you're doing?
Let the little ones
have their share.
We don't want you getting
an upset stomach.
Oh, GusGus,
you're a house mouse,
not a garden mouse.
Isn't he, Jacqueline?
And you mustn't eat
Mr. Goose's food.
Isn't that right, Mummy?
Do you still believe
that they understand you?
Don't they, Mother?
Oh, yes.
I believe that animals listen
and speak to us
if we only have
the ear for it.
That's how we learn
to look after them.
Who looks after us?
Fairy godmothers, of course.
And do you believe in them?
I believe in everything.
Then I believe
in everything, too.
Her father was a merchant
who went abroad
and brought tribute back from
all of Ella's subject lands.
Ella!
Where are my girls,
my beautiful girls?
Where are my darlings?
Ella missed
him terribly when he was away.
But she knew
he would always return.
There she is!
Papa, welcome home!
How are you?
You've grown!
Haven't you, now?
There you go, sir.
What was that?
Oh, this?
I found it hanging on a tree.
I think
there may be something inside.
Oh, it's so pretty.
In French,
that is un papillon.
Ouch. Ouch.
You're standing on my feet.
Shall we?
Look, Mummy!
I'm dancing!
Whee!
Little papillon.
All was just as it should be.
They knew themselves to be the most 
happy of families to live as they did
and to love each other so.

But sorrow
can come to any kingdom,
no matter how happy.
And so it came to Ella's home.
I'm so sorry.
Thank you, Doctor.
This must have been
very difficult for you.
Come.
Ella.
Ella, my darling.
I want to tell you a secret.
A great secret
that will see you through
all the trials
that life can offer.
You must always
remember this.
Have courage and be kind.
You have more kindness
in your little finger
than most people possess
in their whole body.
And it has power,
more than you know.
And magic.
Magic?
Truly.
Have courage and be kind,
my darling.
Will you promise me?
I promise.
Good.
Good.
And...
I must go very soon, my love.
Please forgive me.
Of course
I forgive you.
I love you.
I love you, my darling.
I love you.
Time passed,
and pain turned to memory.
In her heart,
Ella stayed the same.
For she remembered
her promise to her mother.
Have courage, and be kind.
Father, however,
was much changed.
But he hoped
for better times.
"And thence home,
"and my wife and I singing,
to our great content,
"and if ever there were a man
happier in his fortunes,
"I know him not."
Thus ends Mr. Pepys
for today.
I do love a happy ending,
don't you?
They're quite
my favorite sort.
As well they should be.
Ella...
I have come to the conclusion
that it's time, perhaps...
to begin a new chapter.
Indeed, Father?
You'll recall that some
time ago, in my travels,
I made the acquaintance
of Sir Francis Tremaine.
Yes.
The Master of
the Mercer's Guild, is he not?
Was.
The poor man
has died, alas.
His widow,
an honorable woman,
finds herself alone,
though still in the
prime of her life.
You're worried
about telling me.
But you mustn't be.
Not if it will lead
to your happiness.
Yes.
Happiness.
Do you think I may be
allowed one last chance,
even though I thought
such things were done with for good?
Of course I do, Father.
She'll merely be
your stepmother.
And you'll have two lovely
sisters to keep you company.
Have courage, be kind.
Welcome, ladies. Welcome!
She's skinny as a broomstick!
And that stringy hair!
You're very nice.
Welcome.
I'm so happy to meet you.
You have
such pretty hair.
Thank you.
You should
have it styled.
Oh.
I'm sure you're right.
Would you like
a tour of the house?
What did she say?
She wants to show us
around her farmhouse.
She's proud of it, I think.
Do they keep animals inside?
How charming.
How perfectly charming.
Lucifer.
Her stepmothertobe
was a woman of keen feeling
and refined taste.
And she, too, had known grief.
But she wore it
wonderfully well.
You did not say your
daughter was so beautiful.
Oh, she takes after her...
Her mother.
Just so.
What does Mummy mean?
What's so charming about it?
She's lying.
That's just good manners.
Shut up.
How long has your family lived here?
Over 200 years.
And in all that time,
they never thought to decorate?
Anastasia, hush.
They'll think
you are in earnest.
Ella's stepmother,
highspirited lady
that she was,
set out to restore life
and laughter to the house.
Oh, you are awful, Baron.
Ah, fortune favors me again.
Well, look who's
having a party of their own.
Jacqueline, Teddy, Matilda,
greedy GusGus.
Uhoh.
Just what...
Yes, what do you think
you're up to, Lucifer?
Jacqueline is my guest,
and the eating of guests is not allowed.
Go on, now.
You've plenty of cat food to keep you happy.
We ladies must help
one another.
You're missing the party.
Oh, I imagine it's much
like all the other ones.
And I'm leaving
first thing, El.
No. But you're...
You're hardly back
from the last trip.
Do you have to go?
It's just a few months,
my darling.
What would you like me
to bring you home from abroad?
You know, your sisters...
uh, stepsisters,
have asked for
parasols and lace.
What will you have?
Bring me the first branch
your shoulder brushes on your journey.
That's a curious request.
Well, you'll have
to take it with you
on your way...
and think of me
when you look at it.
And when you bring it back,
it means that you'll be with it.
And that's
what I really want.
For you to come back.
No matter what.
I will.
Ella, while I'm away,
I want you to be good
to your stepmother
and stepsisters,
even though they may be...
trying at times.
I promise.
Thank you.
I always leave
a part of me behind, Ella.
Remember that.
And your mother's here, too,
though you see her not.
She's the very heart
of this place.
And that's why we must
cherish this house,
always, for her.
I miss her.
Do you?
Very much.
Remember the lace!
I simply must have it!
And my parasol!
For my complexion!
That means skin,
if you don't know!
Bye!
Bye, Ella!
I love you!
I love you, too!
Bye!
Ella, dear.
Now, now.
Mustn't blub.
Yes, Stepmother.
Oh, you needn't
call me that.
"Madam" will do.
There isn't room for me
and all of your clothes!
Well, then make
yourself smaller!
Anastasia and Drisella
have always shared a room.
Such dear,
affectionate girls.
Or...
Or better yet, disappear entirely!
You'd like that,
wouldn't you?
Sometimes I could scratch
your eyes out!
I think they're finding
the sleeping quarters rather confining.
Oh, well, my bedroom's
the biggest besides
yours and Father's.
Perhaps they'd like
to share it.
What a wonderful idea.
What a good girl you are.
I can stay in the...
The attic.
Quite so.
The attic?
Yes.
Oh, only temporarily, while I have 
all the other rooms redecorated.
The attic's
so nice and airy
and you'll be away from
all of our fuss and bother.
You'd be even more cozy if you kept 
all this bricabrac up there with you.
Keep you amused.
Well...
no one shall disturb me here.
Oh, hello, GusGus.
Oh...
Oh.
Go on, GusGus,
you can do it.
So this is where
you take refuge.
Me too, it would seem.
Right.
Who's going to help me?
Simpleton.
That is the last straw.
Our little sister, up there,
talking to the woodworm.
How very pleasant.
No cats...
and no stepsisters.
We have a halfwit
for a sister.
I've got two.
I heard that.
Who is she
talking to?
She's mad.

It's lunch time!
Mornings did not agree
with Ella's stepsisters.
And they lacked accomplishment
in such domestic arts
as keeping house.
In fact, they lacked
accomplishment in any art.

Do shut up.
Ella's great comfort
were the letters that Father
would send from his travels.
The weeks away
lengthened to months,
but every day would bring his thoughts
from some distant part.
Miss Ella,
it's the mail coach!
Until late one afternoon...
Farmer John?
Miss Ella.
It's your father, miss.
He took ill on the road.
He's passed on, miss.
He's gone.
To the end,
he spoke only of you, miss.
And your mother.
I was to give you this.
But what about my lace?
My parasol?
Can't you see?
None of that matters.
We're ruined.
How will we live?
Thank you.
It must have been
very difficult for you.
How indeed to live.
Economies had to be taken.
Ella's stepmother dismissed
the household.
Her stepmother
and stepsisters
ever misused her.
And by and by
they considered Ella
less a sister than a servant.
And so Ella was left
to do all the work.
This was a good thing,
for it distracted her from her grief.
At least that was what
her stepmother said.
And she and her two daughters
were more than happy
to provide Ella with lots
and lots of distraction.
In their defense, they did share 
with her the very food they ate,
or rather,
the scraps from their table.
She had little
in the way of friends.
Well, her friends
were very little.
There you are.
Have dinner with me,
won't you?
But those friends
she had, she treated with an open heart
and an open hand.
Your table.
Sometimes,
by the end of the day,
the drafty attic was too cold
to spend the night in,
so she lay by the dying
embers of the hearth
to keep warm.
I thought breakfast
was ready.
It is, madam.
I'm only mending the fire.
In future, can we not be called
until the work is done?
As you wish.
Ella, what's that
on your face?
Madam?
It's ash from
the fireplace.
Do clean yourself up.
You'll get cinders
in our tea.
I've got a new name for her!
Cinderwench.
I couldn't
bear to look so dirty.
Oh, Dirty Ella.
Cinderella!
That's what we'll call you.
Oh, girls,
you're too clever.
Who's this for?
Is there someone
we've forgotten?
It's my place.
It seems too much
to expect you to prepare breakfast,
serve it and
still sit with us.
Wouldn't you prefer
to eat when all the work is done, Ella?
Or should I say,
"Cinderella"?
Hmm?
Cinderella.
Names have power,
like magic spells.
And of a sudden,
it seemed to her
that her stepmother
and stepsisters
had indeed transformed her
into merely a creature
of ash
and toil.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Run!
Quickly, my friend,
or they'll catch you!
Go!
Whoa! Easy!
Perhaps it was just 
as well that Ella's stepsisters were cruel.
For had she not run
to the forest,
she might never have met
the prince.
Easy! Easy!
Whoa! Whoa!
Easy, boy!
Come on, boy, slow down!
Miss!
Miss! Are you all right?
Hold on!
I'm all right, thank you!
That's fine.
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa.
Whoa.
Are you all right?
I'm all right,
but you've nearly frightened
the life out of him.
Who?
The stag.
What's he
ever done to you
that you should
chase him about?
I must confess I've
never met him before.
He is a friend of yours?
An acquaintance.
We met just now.
I looked into his eyes,
and he looked into mine,
and I just felt he had
a great deal left to do with his life.
That's all.
Miss, what do they call you?
Never mind what they call me.
You shouldn't be this
deep in the forest alone.
I'm not alone.
I'm with you, Mister...
What do they call you?
You don't know who I am?
That is...
They call me Kit.
Well, my father does
when he's in a good mood.
And...
where do you live, Mr. Kit?
At the palace.
My father's
teaching me his trade.
You're an apprentice?
Of a sort.
That's very fine.
Do they treat you well?
Better than I deserve,
most likely.
And you?
They treat me
as well as they're able.
I'm sorry.
It's not your doing.
Nor yours either, I'll bet.
It's not so very bad.
Others have it worse,
I'm sure.
We must...
simply have courage
and be kind, mustn't we?
Yes.
You're right.
That's exactly how I feel.
Please don't
let them hurt him.
But we're hunting, you see.
It's what's done.
Just because it's what's done
doesn't mean it's what should be done.
Right again.
Then,
you'll leave him alone,
won't you?
I will.
Thank you very much, Mr. Kit.
Ah.
There you are, Your High...
It's Kit! Kit!
Kit! I'm Kit.
I'm on my way.
Well,
we'd better get a move on,
Mr. Kit.
As I said.
On my way.
I hope to see
you again, miss.
And I, you.
You sound as if you're the first fellow
ever to meet a pretty girl.
She wasn't a
"pretty girl."
Well, she was a pretty girl,
but there was
so much more to her.
How much more?
You've only met her once.
How could you know
anything about her?
You told me you knew right away
when you met Mother.
That's different.
Your mother was a princess.
You would have
loved her anyway.
I would
never have seen her,
because it wouldn't
have been appropriate.
And my father would have told me
what I'm telling you
and I would have listened.
No, you wouldn't.
Yes, I would.
No, you wouldn't.
I would.
You wouldn't.
You're right.
Well, how is he?
Your Majesty...
Never mind.
If it takes that long to work out
a way to say it, I already know.
Father...
Way of all flesh, boy.
Come.
We shall be late.
And punctuality is the...
...politeness of princes.
His Majesty, the King!
I'm sure your father spoke
to you of your behavior in the forest.
Is it any business
of yours, Grand Duke?
Your business is my business,
Your Royal Highness.
It will not do to
let the stag go free.
Just because it's what's done 
doesn't mean it's what should be done.
Or something like that.
Master Phineus,
master of the paintbrush,
patiently awaits.
Make him look marriageable,
Master Phineus.
We must attract
a suitable bride,
even if he won't listen
to a word I say.
I shall endeavor to
please, Your Majesty.
But I can't work miracles.
A splendid canvas,
Master Phineus.
Thank you.
As if he knows
anything about art.
So, these portraits
will really be sent abroad?
To induce the high and mighty to attend
this ball you insist upon.
Which is a tradition.
Which is beloved.
At which you will
choose a bride.
Ah, fascinating.
If I must marry, could I not wed,
say, a good, honest country girl?
How many divisions will this
"good, honest country girl" provide us?
How will she make
the kingdom stronger?
We are a small kingdom amongst 
great states, Your Royal Highness.
And it's a dangerous world.
Listen, boy.
Taking you up,
Master Phineus.
Good.
I want to see you
and the kingdom safe.
All right, Father,
on one condition.
Let the invitations
go to everyone, not just the nobility.
The wars have brought
sorrow on us all.
What do you think?
Would that please the people?
It's beyond my wit,
Your Majesty.
But I wouldn't mind
a bit of a jolly.
I think we might have
made a bargain.
A ball for the people,
and a princess
for the prince.
Sounds like a step
in the right direction, if you ask...
We didn't ask you.
I'm so sorry.
Naughty paint, naughty brush.
Down, please, Samson.
Haven't even got a cushion.
Right, down, down.
Not that... Oi!
I'm on the ground.
I am literally on the ground.
Sorry.
Actually this is a
very good angle for you.
Great nostrils.
Could I have a longer brush?
You don't look well, miss.
Not at all.
Why do you stay there,
when they treat you so?
Because I made my mother
and father a promise
to cherish the place
we were so happy.
They loved our house...
and now that they're gone,
I love it for them.
It's my home.
Hear ye! Hear ye!
Quiet!
"Know,
"on this day,
two weeks hence,
"there shall be held,
at the palace,
"a Royal Ball.
"At said ball,
"in accordance
with ancient custom,
"the prince shall choose
a bride.
"Furthermore,
"at the behest
of the prince,
"it is hereby declared
that every maiden in the kingdom,
"be she noble or commoner...
"is invited to attend.
"Such is the command
of our most noble king."
Excuse me, madam.
Ella was enormously excited
to see Kit, the apprentice.
And her stepsisters
were mildly intrigued
by the notion
of meeting the prince.
I shall trick him into loving me.
See if I don't!
This is the
most hugest news!
Calm yourselves.
Now listen to me.
One of you must win
the heart of the prince.
Do that, and we can unwind the debt
in which we were ensnared
when we came to
this backwater!
I, a princess?
Or rather, I,
a princess?
Having delivered your news,
why are you still here?
You must return
to town right away
and tell that seamstress
to run us up three fine ball gowns.
Three?
That's very
thoughtful of you.
What do you mean?
To think of me.
Think of you?
Mummy, she believes
the other dress is for her.
Poor, slow,
little Cinders.
How embarrassing.
You're too ambitious
for your own good.
Oh, no.
I only want to see my friend.
Let me be very clear.
One gown for Anastasia,
one for Drisella,
and one for me!
She doesn't know
what that means.
Good.
Right.
That's settled then.
Now go!
Every girl in the kingdom
will be chasing the prince.
You must get there first before 
the seamstress is drowning in work!
Tell me what
she said, Drisella.
I speak French,
not Italian!
Wake up, Your Royal Highness.
You're in a daze.
I'm sorry.
You've been off
since the hunt.
It's that wonderful girl.
I can't stop thinking about her.
But there are
plenty of girls.
But her spirit,
her goodness...
You don't suppose she has a sister,
do you?
I don't know.
I don't know
anything about her.
Perhaps your mystery girl
may come to the ball.
That is why you threw
the doors open, is it not?
Captain.
It was for the benefit
of the people.
Of course.
How shallow of me.
And if she comes,
then what?
Then you will tell
her you're a prince.
And a prince may
take whichever bride he wishes.
Ha!
Ha?
Yes, "ha."
You know my father
and the Grand Duke
will only have me
marry a princess.
Well, if this girl from
the forest is as charming as you say,
they may change
their minds.
The day of the ball arrived
and the entire kingdom
held its breath
in anticipation.
You want
me to be your queen?
Who? Me?
Tighter.
Tighter!
Tighter.
That's it!
A vision, sister.
Likewise.
We must compete
for the prince's hand.
But let it not mean we harbor 
dark thoughts against each other.
Of course not, dear sister.
I wouldn't dream of poisoning you before
we leave for the ball.
Oh, nor I of pushing you
from a moving carriage on the way there.
Or I of dashing your brains out on the
palace steps as we arrive.
We are sisters, after all.
And blood is so much
thicker than water.
We shall let
the prince decide.
What will he be like,
I wonder?
What does it matter
what he's like?
He's rich beyond reason.
Wouldn't you like to know a bit about him
before you marry him?
Certainly not.
It might change my mind.
I bet you have never
ever spoken to a man.
Have you, moonface?
I have, once.
To a gentleman.
Some menial, no doubt.
Some 'prentice.
He was an apprentice, yes.
All men are fools,
that's what Mama says.
The sooner you learn that,
the better.
The first dance, milady?
Prince Charming,
you're so naughty!
I want to try it.
No, I'm wearing it.
No! No!
Not for the first time,
Ella actually felt pity
for these two schemers,
who could be every bit as ugly within
as they were fair without.
My prince!
He will love me!
But I will be his queen!
If her
stepmother would not have
a fourth dress made,
it seemed to Ella that
there was no reason why
she would not try
to run it up herself.
And besides,
she did have a little help.
My dear girls.
To see you like this...
it makes me believe
one of you might just snare the prince.
And to think I have
two horses in the race!
I daresay no one
in the kingdom will
outshine my daughters.
Cinderella?
It cost you nothing.
It was my mother's
old dress, you see.
And I took it up myself.
Oohla.
Cinderella
at the ball!
No one wants
a servant for a bride.
After all I've done...
I don't want
to ruin anything.
I don't even want
to meet the prince.
Oh, and you won't, because there's no
question of your going.
But, all of the maidens
of the land are invited,
by order of the king.
It is the king
I am thinking of.
It would be an insult
to the royal personage
to take you to the palace
dressed in these old rags.
Rags?
This was my mother's.
Oh, I'm...
sorry to have to tell you...
but your mother's taste
was questionable.
This thing is
so oldfashioned
it's practically
falling to pieces.
The shoulder's frayed.
It's falling to bits.
And this!
It's a ridiculous,
oldfashioned joke!
How could you?
How could I otherwise?
I will not have anyone
associate my daughters with you.
It would ruin
their prospects
to be seen arriving
with a ragged servant girl.
Because that
is what you are.
And that is what
you will always be.
Now mark my words!
You shall not
go to the ball!
Go on, get going!
I'm sorry, Mother.
I'm sorry.
I said I'd have courage,
but I don't.
Not anymore.
I don't believe anymore.
Excuse me.
Can you help me, miss?
Just a little crust of bread,
or better, a cup of milk?
Yes.
Yes, yes, yes.
I think I can find
something for you.
Why are you crying?
Oh, it's nothing.
Nothing?
Nothing.
What is a bowl of milk?
Nothing.
But kindness
makes it everything.
Now, I don't mean to hurry you,
but you really haven't got long, Ella.
How do you know me?
Who are you?
Who am I?
I should think you'd
have worked that one out.
I'm your hairy dogfather.
I mean, fairy godmother!
You can't be.
Why not?
They don't exist.
They're just made up
for children.
Didn't your own mother
believe in them?
Don't say no,
because I heard her.
You heard her?
Oh, fiddlefaddle,
fiddlefaddle.
Right!
First things first.
Let me slip into
something more comfortable.
Mmm.
That's better.
Now, where was I?
How did you...
Oh, yes. Let's see.
What we need is something
that sort of says, "coach."
Um...
Oh, that trough?
Doesn't really say "coach."
No, no, I'm liking
fruit and veg.
Do you grow watermelons?
No.
Cantaloupe?
I don't even know
what that is.
Artichoke?
Kumquat?
Beef tomato?
We do have pumpkins.
Ah.
Pumpkins?
This will be a first for me.
Always interesting.
I don't usually
work with squashes.
Too mushy.
Let me see.
Oh, that'll do.
Yes.
Knife?
There you are.
Thank you, darling.
Hello, my strangely
orange vegetable friend.
A quick snip for you.
Ah, lovely!
Ooh, heavy pumpkin!
Look out, mices!
Oh, well. Never mind.
Let's do it here.
Do what here?
Turn the pumpkin
into a carriage.
You're making me
nervous, actually.
Shall I shut my eyes?
It might be better.
Oh, for heaven's sake.
Let's just go for it.
Ah.
Well, something's
definitely happening.
You see, the trick is...
Actually, I've forgotten what the trick is.
Hmm.
I just thought, if it...
If it does get much bigger...
Yes?
Hang on.
Is that what
you meant to do?
Do you think that's
what I meant to do?
Run! Run, darling!
Take cover!
There!
One carriage.
You really are
my fairy godmother.
Of course.
I don't go about transforming pumpkins
for just anybody.
Now, where are those mice?
Mice?
Yes.
Mice, mice, mice.
There they are.
Bibbidibobbidiboo!
Four white chargers.
GusGus,
how fine you look!
But how did you...
Now, where are we?
Got carriage, horses...
Uh, footmen!
Footmen?
Hello, lovely Mr. Lizard.
Bibbidibobbidiboo!
Hello!
You called?
Now, I need that coachman.
Coachman?
Did I say "coachman"?
I meant "goose."
I can't drive.
I'm a goose.
Now, shoo!
Everyone into place,
no time to be lost!
Come on!
Fairy Godmother!
Yes, what?
My dress.
I can't go
in this dress.
Can you mend it?
Mend it?
No, no. I'll turn it
into something new.
Oh, no, please don't.
This was my mother's.
And I'd like to wear it
when I go to the palace.
It's almost like
taking her with me.
I understand.
But she wouldn't mind
if I gee it up a bit?
Wouldn't mind
a nice blue?
No.
There.
It's beautiful.
She'd love it.
Now, come on.
Off you go. Quick!
You'll be late!
I'm very new at this!
Oh, boy.
Stop that blooming coach!
Whoa!
Thank you.
Just a moment!
Are those the best you have?
It's all right.
No one will see them.
No, they'll ruin the whole look.
Quick, quick.
Take them off.
Really quite hideous.
Let's have something
new for a change.
I'm rather good at shoes.
But...
They're made of glass?
Yes.
And you'll find
they're really comfortable.
Ella, you really
must go now.
Oh, Fairy Godmother?
What is it?
My stepmother
and the girls?
Don't worry.
I'll make sure they
don't recognize you.
Now, off you go.
For you shall
go to the ball.
Ah, in you get.
Oh, so lovely.
Oh, do stop wittering on.
Ella!
I almost forgot.
Remember, the magic
will only last so long.
With the last echo
of the last bell,
at the last stroke
of midnight,
the spell will be broken
and all will return
to what it was before.
Midnight?
Midnight.
That's more
than enough time.
Off you go then.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Goosey, go!
Goodbye!
Chandeliers, aloft!
Princess Mei Mei of Fujian.
Princess Shahrzad
of the Seljuqs.
Your Highness!
Princess Chelina of Zaragosa!
Princess Imani of Shona!
Princess Hiina
of the Chrysanthemum Throne!
Lady Tremaine
and her daughters.
The Lady Tremaine
and her daughters.
I'm Drisella.
And I'm Anastasia.
People will want to know.
I'm the clever one.
I'm very beautiful.
The very clever
Miss Drisella,
and the very
beautiful Anastasia.
Do come on!
The Lord Veneering.
Who are you looking for?
No one.
It's that girl in
the forest, isn't it?
That's why you were
so generous with the invitations.
Father, it was
for the people.
I know you love
the people, Kit.
But I also know that
your head's been turned.
But you've only met
her once, in the forest.
And you would have me marry
someone I met once, tonight.
A princess.
It's a princess or nothing.
Hold the doors!
One more coming in.
May I present
Her Royal Highness,
the Princess Chelina
of Zaragosa.
You are as handsome
as your picture.
And your little kingdom
is enchanting.
I hope the princess will not
find our "little kingdom" too confining.
Miss Ella.
Thank you.
I'm frightened,
Mr. Lizard.
I'm only a girl,
not a princess.
And I'm only a lizard,
not a footman.
Enjoy it while it lasts.
Your Majesty,
Your Royal Highness,
My Lords, ladies
and gentlemen,
distinguished visitors
and people of our land,
the prince shall now
choose his partner for the first dance.
Let our ball commence!
Excuse me.
A thousand apologies,
Your Royal Highness.
I don't know
what happened.
Mr. Kit.
It's you,
isn't it?
Just so.
Your Highness...
If I may...
that is...
it would give me
the greatest pleasure,
if you would do me the honor of
letting me lead you through this...
the first...
Dance?
Yes, dance.
That's it.
They're all looking at you.
Believe me,
they're all looking at you.
Who is she?
I have no idea.
Who's that, Mama?
I'm not exactly sure,
but this does not bode well.
That's a lovely dress
she's got on.
And how pretty she is.
Concentrate!
You must turn the prince's head, you fools!
Now, get out there!
But no one's
asked us to dance.
Gentlemen.
Oh!
May I present my daughters,
Anastasia, Drisella.
Mademoiselle.
Off you go!
Smile.
Come with me.
Over there. Smile.
So, you're the prince!
Not "the prince," exactly.
There are plenty of princes
in the world.
I'm only a prince.
But your name's
not really Kit.
Certainly it is,
and my father still calls me that,
when he's especially
unpeeved at me.
But you're no apprentice.
I am.
An apprentice monarch.
Still learning my trade.
Oh, gosh!
Look, please forgive me.
I thought you might treat me
differently if you knew.
I mistook you for a good,
honest country girl,
and now I see you didn't want to
overawe a plain soldier.
Little chance of that.
No more surprises?
No more surprises.
Is that you?
I hate myself in paintings.
Don't you?
No one's ever painted
my portrait.
No?
Well, they should.
Who is she?
She gave no name, Your Grace.
You didn't ask?
I was out of breath,
Your Grace,
on account of introducing
Princess Blodwyn of Llanfairpwllgwyngyll...
Shut up, will you?
"Shut up." Absolutely.
I don't believe this!
No! Not her!
Won't they
miss you at the ball?
Maybe.
But let's not
go back just yet.
What's wrong?
When I go back, they will try to 
pair me off with a lady of their choosing.
I'm expected to marry
for advantage.
Oh.
Well, whose advantage?
That is a good question.
Well, surely you have
a right to your own heart.
And I must weigh that
against the king's wishes.
He's a wise ruler
and a loving father.
Well, perhaps he'll
change his mind.
I fear he hasn't
much time to do so.
Poor Kit.
People are saying
she's a princess.
Our prince seems
quite taken with her.
She went
straight for him.
You have to appreciate
her efficiency.
But surely, if she is a princess,
this may be good.
I've already promised him in marriage,
to the Princess Chelina.
But...
Oh.
Forgive me, Your Grace.
I did not mean to intrude.
No, it's you who have
to forgive me, madam.
Your secret
is safe with me.
I've never shown
this place to anyone.
A secret garden.
I love it!
Please.
No, I shouldn't.
You should.
I shouldn't.
You should.
I shouldn't.
You should.
I will.
May I?
Please.
Oh!
It's made of glass.
And why not?
Allow me.
Thank you.
There.
There.
Won't you tell me
who you really are?
If I do, I think everything
might be different.
I don't understand.
Can you at least tell me your name?
My name is...
I have to leave.
It's hard to explain.
Lizards and pumpkins,
and things.
Wait!
Where are you going?
You've been awfully nice.
Thank you for a wonderful evening.
I've loved it.
Every second!
"Lizards and pumpkins."
Excuse me.
Sorry! Terribly sorry.
My goodness!
My prince!
You've got the wrong one!
You've got the wrong one!
He needs her name!
I know he needs her name.
Her name, you ninny.
Get her name!
Ooh, that really hurt!
Oh, Your Majesty.
Young lady.
I am so sorry.
Oh, think nothing
of it, my dear.
I wanted to say,
Your Majesty,
your son Kit is the most lovely
person I ever met.
So good and brave.
I hope you know
how much he loves you.
Excuse me!
Mmm.
Wait!
Wait!
Where are you going?
Hurry, hurry!
Eh? Ah!
Come back!
Hurry!
Hurry, please, Mr. Goose!
Wait!
Watch out!
Captain, my horse.
No!
This may be some intrigue to lure you
from the palace.
Your father
needs you here.
Captain!
I was having
a fine old time.
You had to go and
choose that one, didn't you?
Yes, I did.
Hurry, Mr. Goose!
Come on!
Heeya!
Be careful, Mr. Goose!
Oh!
Oh, my goodness!
You there!
Stop in the name of the king!
Such bad timing.
Halt there!
I know what to do!
Yes!
Oh, yes!
Get this thing open!
Oh, dear!
Ah!
No, no, no.
Oh, I'm sorry.
You'll find it's
very comfortable.
Oh...
Do shut up!
Cinderella!
Cinderella!
We'll have to wake her up.
Cinderella!
Wake up, lazy bones!
Tea and a plate
of biscuits.
Welcome back!
You look cheerful!
And wet!
Oh, uh, I took a walk
in the rain to cheer myself up.
Typical.
Tea.
We did not communicate
through mere words.
Our souls met.
Precisely.
My soul and the prince's soul.
Your soul was over
by the banquet tables.
You didn't see
him dance with me.
Dance with you?
He didn't even speak to you.
It was not our fault, Mother.
It was that girl.
The mystery princess.
Mystery princess?
My, what a charming notion.
Oh, she was no princess.
She was a preening interloper who made
a spectacle of herself.
Oh?
A vulgar, young hussy
marched into the ball,
unaccompanied, if you will,
and to the horror of everyone,
threw herself at the prince.
And he actually
danced with the ugly thing.
Yes?
Yes.
It was pity.
He was too polite to send her packing in
front of everyone, you see.
But not wanting to expose us 
to the presumptuous wench any further,
he took her apart.
And told her off.
But she refused to leave
and the palace guards
chased her from the party!
I pity the prince.
Such bad taste.
They belong
with each other.
Well, it's no matter, girls.
The ball was a mere diversion.
The prince is not free
to marry for love.
He's promised to the
Princess Chelina of Zaragosa.
The Grand Duke
told me himself.
It's so very unfair.
Yes.
The way of the world.
Oh, hello again.
Thank you for your help.
It really was like a dream.
Better than a dream.
Ella couldn't wait to write down
all that had happened,
so that she might remember
every single bit of it
just as if she were telling
her mother and father
about the palace ball
and her time with the prince.
Above all, the prince.
Oh, you've come.
Good.
Oh, Father.
Don't go.
I must.
You needn't be alone.
Take a bride.
The Princess Chelina.
What if I commanded
you to do so?
I love and respect you,
but I will not.
I believe that we
need not look outside of our borders
for strength or guidance.
What we need
is right before us.
And we need only have courage
and be kind to see it.
Just so.
You've become your own man.
Good.
And perhaps,
in the little time left to me,
I can become
the father you deserve.
You must not
marry for advantage.
You must marry for love.
Find that girl.
Find her.
The one they're
all talking about.
The forgetful one
who loses her shoes.
...loses her shoes.
Oh, be cheerful, boy.
Thank you, Father.
Thank you, Kit.
I love you, son.
I love you, Father.
Once the time
for mourning had passed,
a proclamation was sent out.
Hear ye! Hear ye!
Hear ye!
Know that our new king
hereby declares
his love for...
the mysterious princess...
as wore...
glass slippers to the ball.
And requests that
she present herself at the palace,
whereupon,
if she be willing,
he will forthwith marry her...
...with all due ceremony.
Are you looking for this?
There must be quite
a story to go with it.
Won't you tell me?
No?
All right then.
I shall tell you a story.
Once upon a time,
there was a beautiful
young girl
who married for love.
And she had
two loving daughters.
All was well...
but, one day, her husband,
the light of her life, died.
The next time,
she married for the sake
of her daughters.
But that man, too,
was taken from her.
And she was doomed to look every day
upon his beloved child.
She had hoped to marry off
one of her beautiful,
stupid daughters to
the prince.
But his head was turned
by a girl with glass slippers.
And so...
I lived unhappily ever after.
My story would appear
to be ended.
Now, tell me yours.
Did you steal it?
No.
It was given to me.
Given to you?
Given to you.
Nothing is ever given.
For everything,
we must pay and pay.
That's not true.
Kindness is free.
Love is free.
Love is not free.
Now, here is
how you will pay me,
if you are to have
what you desire.
No one will believe you,
a dirty servant girl without a family,
if you lay claim
to the prince's heart.
But with a respectable
gentlewoman to put you forward,
you will not be ignored.
When you are married,
you will make me the head
of the royal household.
Anastasia and Drisella
we will pair off with wealthy lords.
And I shall manage that boy.
But he's not a boy.
And who are you?
How would you
rule a kingdom?
Best to leave it to me.
That way we all get
what we want.
No.
No?
I was not able to protect
my father from you,
but I will protect the prince
and the kingdom...
no matter what becomes of me.
Well, that is a mistake.
No!
Why?
Why are you so cruel?
I don't understand it.
I've tried to be kind to you.
You? Kind to me?
Yes.
And though no one
deserves to be treated
as you have treated me.
Why do you do it?
Why?
Why?
Because you are young,
and innocent, and good.
And I...
No!
No!
May I ask where you got this?
From a ragged
servant girl in my household.
The mystery princess
is a commoner.
You could imagine when I discovered
her subterfuge how horrified I was.
You told no one else?
Not even my own daughters.
No one need ever
know the truth.
You've spared the kingdom
a great deal of embarrassment.
And I should like
to keep it that way.
Are you threatening me?
Yes.
So what do you want?
I should like
to be a countess.
And I require advantageous marriages
for my two daughters.
Done.
And the girl?
Oh.
Do with her
what you will.
She's nothing to me.
Where?
Abandoned on the
side of the road.
And have you
found her?
The girl?
No, she's disappeared.
There must be some
reason she vanished.
Perhaps she has been
prevented from speaking.
Do not lose heart, Kit.
On the contrary,
lose heart and gain wisdom.
The people need to know
that the kingdom is secure.
That the king has a queen,
and the land may have an heir.
They want to face the
future with certainty!
Agreed!
Then let us be certain.
I am king.
I say we shall seek out
the mystery princess,
even if she does
not want to be found.
I have to see her again.
But if she's not found...
then for the good of the kingdom, 
you must marry the Princess Chelina.
For the good of the kingdom.
Very well, agreed.
But Your Highness...
But you will
spare no effort.
Your Majesty, of course.
You have my word.
Next.
The slipper traveled 
the length and breadth of the kingdom,
visiting every maiden
both high and low,
and every sort in between.
Oh, Lord!
You first, madam.
Well, I'll give it a go.
Right. I say.
Where do you want me?
Oh!
Up! Up I go.
Oh, careful,
my foot's a bit swollen.
I've been...
It's the yeast.
The Grand
Duke was true to his word.
He spared no effort to
demonstrate to the prince
that the mystery princess
was not to be found.
It fits!
It doesn't fit you.
It does fit!
It doesn't fit.
It's mine!
I am the mystery princess!
Give back the shoe.
Take the shoe
away from her!
Don't take the shoe
away from me, please, please!
Please, it's my shoe!
Make way for the slipper!
Can I try the other foot?
I don't think so.
But whatever they tried,
the magical slipper refused to fit 
even the most eligible of maidens.
We found the mystery
princess for ya!
What's wrong, Captain?
We haven't found the girl.
I'm disappointed
for our king.
Oh, come on, now!
Don't lose heart.
There's one more house.
We must leave
no stone unturned.
Horses!
Horses!
Mother, it's our chance!
Let them in!
Gentlemen!
What a wonderful surprise.
A moment of your time, good lady.
Of course, Your Grace.
Please. This way.
Ella did not
know who was downstairs.
Nor did she care.
For surely no one
had come to see her.
Jacqueline, stop it!
It shrunk.
Try again.
Oh, enough!
♪ You must love me... ♪
Though Ella was sad,
her spirit was not broken.
She knew that the ball,
and her time
with the prince,
would become beautiful,
distant memories,
like those of her
father and mother,
and her golden childhood.
It fits me!
Bad luck, miss.

Captain. Let's be off.
But she's lying, Your Grace.
Nonsense!
I trust the lady. We're leaving.
Grand Duke!

What sweet singing.
Makes me want to tarry just a little.

There! You see?
I told you it was
no one of any importance.
We'll see about that.
Miss.
You are requested and required 
to present yourself to your king.
I forbid you to do this!
And I forbid you
to forbid her!
Who are you to stop
an officer of the king?
Are you an empress?
A saint?
A deity?
I am her mother.
You have never been...
and you never
will be my mother.
Come now, miss.
Just remember who
you are, you wretch!
Would who she was,
who she really was, be enough?
There was no magic
to help her this time.
This is perhaps the greatest
risk that any of us will take.
To be seen as we truly are.
Have courage, and be kind.
Who are you?
I am Cinderella.
Your Majesty...
I'm no princess.
I have no carriage,
no parents,
and no dowry.
I do not even know
if that beautiful slipper will fit.
But...
if it does...
will you take me as I am?
An honest country girl
who loves you.
Of course I will.
But only if you will
take me as I am.
An apprentice still
learning his trade.
Please.
Cinderella!
Ella!
My dear sister!
I'm sorry.
So very sorry.
Shall we?
I forgive you.
Forgiven or not,
Cinderella's stepmother
and her daughters
would soon leave
with the Grand Duke,
and never set foot
in the kingdom again.
They would
have loved each other.
We must have
a portrait of you painted.
Oh, no. I do hate
myself in paintings.
Be kind.
And have courage.
And all will be well.
Are you ready?
For anything,
so long as it's with you.
My queen.
My King.
And so Kit
and Ella were married,
and I can tell you,
as her fairy godmother,
that they were counted to be
the fairest and kindest rulers
the kingdom had known.
And Ella continued to see
the world not as it is,
but as it could be,
if only you believe
in courage...
and kindness
and occasionally...
just a little bit of magic.
