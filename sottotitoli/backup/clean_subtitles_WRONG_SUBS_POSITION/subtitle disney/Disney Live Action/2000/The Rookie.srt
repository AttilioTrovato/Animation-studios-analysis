Ther e's a story told in
the town of Big Lake, Texas __
a story of the town's
beginnings.
It's the story
of the Santa Rita Number One,
birthplace
of West Texas Oil.
Now, as with
most Texas legends,
ther e was a man who thought oil
was right beneath his f eet.
And as with
most such stories,
no one else believed him.
Ex cept in this case
f or two nuns,
who in 1923 met the man
and believed so much in him
and his dr eam
that they invested money
no one knew they had.
Now, when the nuns told
their parish priest
about the man's dr eam
and their investment in it,
now, he counseled them
to try and get their money back.
Sheepishly, they admitted
that it was too late,
that the money
was alr eady spent.
Well, the priest, he sighed,
shook his head,
and off er ed just
one small bit of advice __
bless the site
with rose petals,
and invoke the help
of Saint Rita,
patron saint
of impossible dr eams.
And while the workers
waited f or the oil
that would eventually come,
they played baseball.
Oil worker:
He's outta here.
Played baseball so well
that some wer e able to give up
the dirt and the despair
and went on to play
majorleague ball
in the glory days
of Ruth and Gehrig.

Come on!
I've heard and told
that story on many occasions,
but that was long bef or e
Saint Rita decided
to bless our little town
just one mor e time.
__ 
__ Yeah!
First game
in the big leagues,
and Jimmy Morris
has a nohitter going.
Agh, Jimmy,
don't throw it so hard.
My hands ar e cold.

Agh!
What ar e you doing?
Waiting till Spring,
that's what I'm doing.
Jimmy...
Your f ather and I
need to talk to you.
I hear Virginia's
r eal nice __
at least that's what
the Navy f olks told your f ather.
Isn't that right, Jim?
We'll just be moving
again.
It's my job
to decide when we move.
It's your job
to make the best of it.
Jim, please.
Who knows? Maybe it won't snow
so much in Virginia.
"Jimmy Morris,
"with another masterf ul
pitching perf ormance,
"well on his way
to another
World Series title."



Jimmy...
Your f ather and I
need to talk to you.


Come on, Jimmy.


Hey.
Jimmy.

Hey, partner.
How you doing?
Hey.
Hey, Dad.
Jimmy.
Hmm?
I had a good game __
13 strikeouts.
Did you win?
I just f ound out
there's a chance we may be
restationed again.
__ How much of a chance?
__ It's in West Texas.
The Navy wants me to be
a recruiter there.
Texas? When?
Thr ee weeks.
But, Dad...
We still got
half our season to play.
I'm awar e of that.
Well, maybe I could stay
with the Johnsons.
Unhunh.
We move as a f amily.
I don't have a choice
in this.
What kind of baseball
do they have?
They don't.
I hear they might be starting
some summer ball.
Yes, sir.


What are those things?
What?
Those things moving up
and down.
Oil rigs.
When those things
are moving up and down,
it means times are good.
Looks like times ar e good.
Shoot.

We must have left some of them
back in Florida.
Left what?
I packed a couple of box es
with socks and things.
I could've sworn __
Jimmy, did you find
that one box?
Oh, no.
It's okay, Mom.
Don't worry, honey.
We'll find it.
I've never known a boy
to get so upset about
losing his socks.
His glove was in ther e.
His what?
His glove was in there.
Oh, quit moping
and grab a box.
Did you hear me?
Ther e ar e mor e important things
in lif e than baseball.
The sooner you figure that out,
the better.




This Lee lvacococus guy,
I guarantee you,
within two years,
three years tops,
he's gonna run that company
right out of business.
Ain't that right,
young man?
Eileen?
Eileen!
I guess she gone to lunch.
Help you find
something, son?
Socks.
Socks we have __
in contrast to common sense,
which we seem to be running
a little short on today.
I'll be right down.
Don't look at my dominoes.
All right, sir, we got
white socks with red stripes,
black stripes, blue stripes.
Over ther e you got
all your solids
in black, blue,
brown, and gray.
Just take your pick.
That's a r eal nice pair
right ther e.
You visiting?
We just moved her e.
Oh, well,
then I'm Henry Sampson.
Nice to meet you.
Jimmy Morris.
Welcome to Big Lake,
Mr. Jimmy Morris.
You know, son, I can probably
tell you wher e it is
a whole lot quicker
than you can find it.
Got any baseball stuff?
Oh, baseball stuff.
Don't get much call
f or baseball stuff
around these parts.
Now if it was football,
that'd be a whole different
story. 
You know something,
though?
I got a catalogue over here
that just might
help us out some.
Let's take a look at that.

Yeah, I think we might find
something in here.
You know, if you'r e inter ested
in baseball,
ther e's a story that people her e
in this town tell
that you probably
ought to hear.
Thought you said nobody her e
car ed about baseball.
Oh, they car e about this.
It all started
with a couple of nuns
and a piece of ground
not too f ar f rom here.



__ Morning, Esther.
__ Morning, Jimmy.
Any more rattlesnakes
on the playground?
Yeah. Two this morning.
I swear those things show up
every time
the oil business goes bad.
__ They gonna bring
the kids in?
__ They're thinking about it.
Don't these f amilies
have enough to worry about?
Hmm.
Coach.
Counselor.

Don't r eport that, Esther.
I never do.
"Sum" means
that we'r e adding.
We have at least two items.
Don't make this hard,
but what ar e we adding
her e __
protons and...
Neutrons?
Neutrons.
Neutrons.
So, David...
These protons
and these neutrons,
they're inside of...what?
The nucleus?
Well, don't say it
like a question, son.
If you think you know it, just
say it like you know it.
The nucleus.
That's right __
the nucleus.

So, congratulations.
Go home tonight
and tell your par ents
that you figur ed out
the mass number of an atom.
Nat "King" Cole:
## Chestnuts roasting... ##
Frank, ain't it
a little late to be
playing this song?
__ It's 8:30.
__ It's March.
Well, that song's too good
to play f or only one month.
__ Hunter, you gonna want
cheese on that?
__ Yes, sir.
Besides, he smoked
three packs a day.
Who?
Nat "King" Cole. He thought
it'd make his voice deeper.
Oh, and Frank Sinatra
was the poster child
for vocal care?
Who died in his 50s?
You take care of yourself,
things work out.
Oh, is that right, is it?
Well, what about Jimmy, ther e?
I mean, he took
r eal good car e of himself,
and, uh, how many surgeries
was it, Jimmy __ f our?

They put this thing
f rom his ankle up
to his shoulder.
Ow.
We'r e talking about singing,
not pitching.
And, Hunter,
do us all a f avor
and don't tell us that bit
about the ankle anymore.
__ Mel Torme in June.
__ What in the world ar e you
talking about now?
Mel Torme wrote
"The Christmas Song"
on a beach somewher e.
There wasn't no Jack Frost
nippin' at anybody's nose
that day.
__ Daddy...
__ Yeah?
Your arm ever hurt
anymor e?
Only when I have to
drag you out of bed
in the morning
f or school.
No, I'm just kidding
you, bud.
It hasn't hurt
in a long time.
How long?
Why do you want to know?
Just wondering.
Oh, let's see.
Uh...
It never hurt
when I was in high school,
'cause we didn't have
a baseball team.
And it never hurt
when I was in junior college,
'cause, well, that's why
I got drafted.
And then, uh...
I don't know.
Just started hurting.
Is that why
you didn't make it?
It's never one thing.





Mmm.

I'll get her.
Is that a r eal
"I'll get her,"
or ar e you just
waiting f or me to say,
"Go back to sleep"?
I haven't decided yet.
Go back to sleep.

Mm, baby...
Aww...
Oh...
Oh...
What's all that
crying about?


I think it's my turn.
No.
It's your turn to sleep.
Shh.
Okay.
You sur e?
Yeah.
Here we go.
Come on, baby.
There we are.
Good night.
Good night.
Mmm.
Ther e we go.
Shh.
Mmm.
Ther e we go.
Hey, Rudy, when was
the last date you had __
what, like a year ago?
Not me, man.
Come on, man.
Who you kidding?
You, too, Rudy.
Don't be laughing.
All set, coach.
Give me a ball.
Owls player: Hey, coach,
I forgot my glove.
__ Check the bag.
__ 
__ 10 players, 9 gloves.
__ Yeah.
__ How do they look?
__ Couple of holes.
All right, get one.
Thanks, man.
Hey, coach...
They putting down any grass seed
in the field this year?
Man, it's a goat track
out her e.
Just waiting
f or the seed to take.
Uhhuh?
__ What seed?
__ 
Ain't no seed
out her e, man.
Wack!
How come we get dirt,
and the f ootball field looks
like Tiger Woods' backyard?
They don't even play
f or six months.
Just let me worry
about the field, all right?
You plan on worrying
anytime soon?
__ All right, Wack.
__ 
You can get your running done
early today.
All right, I'll get
my running in early.
Lookin' good.
Okay, bring it home!

Hey, coach...
you want to throw?
You know, I seen you
out there at the Old
Legion Field at night.
You know,
sometimes it helps
when you throw
if you got somebody
catching f or you.
A ball, a glove __
that kind of thing.
__ I'll throw a couple.
__ Really?
All right.
How come you throw out there
all by yourself?
Helps me relax.
I've been doing it...
a pr etty long time.
Coach, back when you
wer e r eally throwing,
how f ast wer e you
bringing it?
I don't know.
Well, that's not bad.
Well, it is when
the other guy's
throwing 90.
Coach, come on.
Let's see you bring one.
Can't.
Promised too many doctors.
Come on, coach,
one is not gonna kill you.
Now, come on.
Feed me.
Yeah, Dad.
Bring the heat.
Feed me, coach.

Wow!
Coach...
Wher e'd that come f rom?
Forgot how good
that sounded.
Yes!





Unbelievable.
Coach, how f ast do you
think those were coming?
__ Oh, not as f ast
as you think.
__ Oh.
Hey, uh, do me a f avor,
all right?
Let's just keep this
between you and me.
Okay.
You could barely see
that last one.
And that goes f or you too,
all right?
__ No telling Mom.
__ Why?

Because I said so.
Good night, Ray.
I know why
your grass isn't growing.

Usually get thr ee or f our
out her e every night.
So I put the seed down,
they pick it up.
Once it comes in,
they don't like it as much.
That's why the f ootball field
looks so good.
Yeah?
Maybe those f ootball guys
ar e paying off these deer
with all the big budget money
they got.

Hey!
Go on! Get out of here!
I thought deer
wer e supposed to be skittish.


Need me
to top that off?
Nothing like wine bought
with a Chevron cr edit card.
Well, I know what a demanding
consumer you can be.
Mmm. Yeah?
Yeah.

I thr ew today.
To Joel...
after practice.
You thr ew?
I thr ew.
How hard?
Pr etty hard.
Uh, don't worry.
If it starts to hurt,
ll'll stop.
All right? Promise.
I gotta check on
the kids.
Joe David: Wack, got
the muffler changed,
buddy __ the jeep.
Can't hear me coming three
miles away, can you, there?
Owls player:
Ray, check out the screwball!
Ladies loving the jeep.
Come on, man.
Give me the rock.
All right,
bring it in f or some b.p.
We can't.
Rudy's not her e.
__ Well, wher e is he?
__ Locker room.
Something to do
with only having one shoe.
Somebody grab a bat.
You'r e throwing
batting practice?
Yeah.
__ 
__ I'm up first, man.
I hit the Lotto!
Joe David: Come on, Wack!
Send it, baby!
Send it!
What do you say, Wack?

__ Whoo!
__ Yeah!
Looks like that one's
gonna land in another
time zone, coach!
You might want to r eset your
watch bef or e this next one.
You see that?
Yeah, it's...
Come on.
Joe David: Yeah!


__ 
__ 
What was that?
Man!
Wait till he warms up.



Let me see
another one of those.
Nope. It's batting practice,
not pitching practice.

All right.
Oh, my God!
I'm already down
two bits.
How many of them
job applications you plan on
sending out, Jimmy?
Many as it takes, I guess.
So the little boy
coming into my stor e to buy
socks after a dozen moves
is planning on making
a move of his own now?
Well, this is diff er ent.
It always is.
I hear you diagnosed
that problem with that
baseball field of yours.
You mean
his potential field.
Well, "diagnosed" part's right.
It's the "curing" part I'm
having trouble with.
I'll take five.
You know, I had the same
trouble out at my place
a few Springs back.
You did?
What'd you do?
Oh, hell.
Give me five, too.
Let me ask you something __
how many games
you got on that field
next couple of weeks?
Well, we __ we play ther e
next Friday,
but then we'r e not back
till the end of the month.
You think you can keep
your boys off the field
f or that length of time?
Now, I'm talking about no
practice, nothing whatsoever.
Henry...
why do I get the f eeling
this is something
I don't want to know about?
I'm gonna take back
two of them old ones
if that's okay with everybody.
I'll tell you what you do.
You give me thr ee weeks,
and I'll have that field
Iooking gr eener than Dublin
on Saint Patty's Day.
50 cents, fellas.

All right, boys.
Get a hit.

Rudy Bonilla, hoping to
spark a Big Lake rally.
Come on, Rudy!
Be a hitter!
Owls player:
Keep your eye on it.
Strike thr ee!
Strike three called,
and the Owls drop
their season opener.
It's all right.
It's okay. Good eff ort.
It's only one.
If we don't start hitting,
it's not gonna be the only one.
Opposing player: Good game.
Good game, buddy.
Drive safely
on your way home now, folks.
Good game.
Good game.



Wher e do you keep
your brooms, Cal?
Closet.
Right her e, sweetheart.
Owls player: Come on, Cory.
Give it a ride.
__ Give it a ride, now.
__ 
Get ready, Cory.
Owls player #2:
Guy couldn't throw a fit...
Come on, Cory!
__ Yeah!
__ Oh!
Play's at second,
Miguel!
__ 
Blue!
Time!

And the Owls are down 10.
Not your day, Rudy.
Not my year.
Looks like
coach Jimmy Morris
is making a pitching change.
Owls player:
Shake it off, Rudy!
Just a reminder, folks __
the concession stand
is still open.
Anybody want to tell me
how we lost that game?
Hmm?
No?
How 'bout taking a look
at the numbers
on that scoreboard
out there?
What do those numbers
tell you?
How to get ahold
of Bo's Tir e Barn?

You quit.
You quit out there.
You quit on me, and worse,
you quit on yourselves.
Now, what is it?
Think people don't car e about
baseball around her e?
Think the school's gonna
drop the program?
You're just making it easy
for 'em.
Sad part about it is,
I see it and you don't.
Look, guys...
Most of you...

You'r e gonna
finish up school her e,
you'r e gonna work the rigs,
you'r e gonna work at
Bo's Tir e Barn,
you'r e gonna raise a f amily
and r etir e,
and you'r e gonna do all that
right her e in Big Lake.
And ther e's nothing wrong
with that.
A lot of r eal good people have
done that.
I'm doing it.
But if you're looking for
something more
after you're done here,
you better give
some serious thought
as to how you'r e gonna play out
the r est of this season.
What diff er ence
does it make?
I mean, it's not
like any of us ar e
getting scholarships.
I'm not talking about
college.
I'm talking about
wanting things in lif e.
I'm talking about
having dr eams.
And all that starts
right her e.
Okay? Right here.
You don't have dr eams,
you don't have anything.
Coach,
what about you?
I mean,
you talk about our dr eams.
I... I mean,
I've been catching yours __
Joel, we ar e not talking
about me.
Yeah, come on, coach.
Every time you throw,
I got to ice my hand __
every time.
Yyou'r e the one
who should be
wanting something mor e.
And the sad part is,
I mean...
We see it and you don't.
Now, listen,
I've had my shot, all right?
Just... 
Look, we got practice
tomorrow.
Let's go.
__ So you take another shot.
__ It doesn't work like that.
It does if
you throw hard enough.
I don't throw hard enough,
all right?
__ Now let's hit the shower.
Come on.
__ NNow wait a minute.
We start winning,
you try out again.


Last time I checked,
scouts ar en't looking f or
highschool science teachers.
Well, not many science
teachers throw like you.
__ No kidding.
__ Yeah.
__ No lie.
Take a heck of a lot
mor e than a couple of Wins
to get me to make
a f ool of myself.
All right.
What if we win district?
Huh?
What if we win district
and go to state playoff s? Then?
Ar e you serious?
Yeah, absolutely.
Ar e you serious?
Yeah.
Yeah.
And all I have to do is just
find some kind of tryout
somewher e?
That's it, man.

All right.
__ Yeah!
__ Yeah!
__ Yeah!
If...
__ If you win district.
__ Yeah!
Come on, man,
we can do this!
__ Right on, man.
__ Yeah, coach!
We can take it!
Whoo!
Let's do this, man!
I don't get to tell Mom
about this, do l?

You sure about this,
Henry?
Yeah. Deer get
a whiff of human hair,
they just keep on moving
till they don't smell it
no mor e.
I figur e we put us
a circle
all the way

This is a lot of hair.
Well,

I was r eading in the paper

That's a kid joke,
Grandpa.
Kid joke? No kidding?
Jimmy.
Sir.
Whoa!
It's kinda big.
Oh, you'll grow into it

Look, Dad, it doesn't have
any fingers.
That's 'cause
it's a firstbaseman's mitt.
Uh...is that wrong?
Well, you know, ll probably
got the r eceipt somewher e.
Uh, we can just __
we can get another one, huh?
One with fingers.
That's okay, Grandpa.
I like first base.
Can I go outside
and play, Dad?
Yeah.
What do you say first?
Thank you, Grandpa.
I r eally like it a lot.
Oh.
Oh.
Stay in the yard.
If he decides he wants
one with fingers...
I'll take car e of it.

I didn't know
you had these.
Oh, yeah.
Your mother gave me a f ew.
Hmm. She'd be the one
to have 'em.
## Happy birthday to you ##
## Happy birthday to you ##
## Happy birthday,

## Happy birthday to you ##
Make a wish. Oh!

Hey, don't worry, baby.
Your wish still counts.

Do you think that

Oh, I gotta go get

I'll help you, Mom.
I think we need plates,

__

Seems like
five minutes ago
I was watching you
blow out those candles.
Ar e you trying to
make me f eel old?
Come talk to me
in 20 years.
Hunter says you spent
some time at your f ather's
today.
Yeah.
You know wher e
I'm going with that.
Yes, ma'am, I do.
Lorri says he's trying
r eal hard
to be a good grandf ather.
Yeah, well...
Lord, Jimmy, I swear,
the one thing you got f rom him
is his stubborn side.
__ That's not true.
__ 
Well, what do you
want me to do,
pr etend everything
was perf ect?
You've been blaming your f ather
f or too many things
f or too many years.
I just call 'em
like I see 'em, Mom.

Jimmy, you can sell that story
someplace else, 'cause
I ain't buying.
You got your shot
at baseball.
You got hurt.
Simple as that.
It had nothing to do
with your f ather.
You think
he didn't have dr eams?

That why it didn't work out
with you two?

I'm gonna need a longer str eet
f or that talk.

Okay, let's get two.

Come on, Wack!
Come on, coach, how long
we gotta practice her e?
Just a couple
of more days.
Joe David:
Getting old out here, coach.
Playing in a gravel yard.
Okay, Wack.
Come on in f or
batting practice.
Owls player: This is
not a ball field.
__ Come on, let's go.
__ Okay, okay.

Okay.
Nice, easy swings.
Turn your hips.
Throw your hands
at the ball.
Come on, coach, ll mean,
if we'r e gonna start winning,
we need to see
some better pitching.
Yeah.
You gonna help us or not?
Come on, coach,
right here.
Joe David: Yo, let's see
some action.

Joe David: Come on, Wack.

## When I was a boy ##
## I thought it just came
to ya ##
## But I never could tell
what's mine ##
## So it didn't matter anyway ##
How 'bout that
for an outstanding double play?
## My only pride and joy ##
## Was this racket down here ##
## Bangin' on an old guitar... ##
The Owls win again,
and that is five in a row.

## There's just

Going...going...

Hey! Hey!
Hey, hey, hey!
Keep it down now,

that f ootball season's
started alr eady!
__ Yeah!
__ Yeah!
__ Yeah!
Now, a lot of coaches
would say
that they'r e r eally proud
of you right now,
and I am.
__ Yeah!
__ Yeah!
__ Yeah!
A lot of coaches __
a lot of coaches would say
that it's amazing
that we won this many
games in a row,
and it is.
__ Yeah! !
__ Yeah! !

But! But!
But, but, but,

I am not gonna say

Quite a group

__ Well, thanks.

District in Fort Worth.
__ Oh.
I was hoping we might be
able to talk about that
application you sent us.
Uh...sur e.


They'll understand.
I got most of 'em
coming back.
Jimmy, you'r e always gonna have
kids coming back.
Not these kids.
It's Fort Worth.
Highschool coaching jobs
don't get any better.
You get to coach,
you get to teach...
And not that it's the most
important thing in lif e,
but...it is twice the money,
Jimmy.
We sur e could use it.
I know.
Well, I am done telling you
to sleep on it,
because that sur e
ain't working.


Thr ee years ago,
this program ended the season
with only one win.
Two years ago...
one win.
Last year...same story.
This year...
We have won 16 games.
And, gentlemen...
We need 17.
Anybody got any questions?
Hmm?
Coach...
Coming back next year?
Wack...
Why don't we worry about
this year first, all right?
All right, gentlemen,
hats off.
Lord, we humbly thank You
f or bringing us her e
this season without injury
and inspiring us...

That's good, Jim.
Pitch.
Pitch.
Man, you wer e bringing
some heat out ther e.
Aw, come on.
You had 'em talking.
You had 'em talking.
Good job, man.

That was Jessica.
Jim.
You did good,
though, man.
How f ast wer e you throwing
15 years ago?
Slow enough that scouts stopped
using the word "f ast."
Jim, how f ast
wer e you throwing?
I don't know.
Why?
You just thr ew
98 miles an hour.
Nah.
Dozen straight pitches.
Thr ee radar guns.
Same thing on all of 'em.
Nah, DDave,
ther e's no way that I __
I've been a scout
a long time now,
and Rule Number One is arms
slow down when they get older.
Listen, Jim,
I call the office
and I tell them I got a guy her e
almost twice these kids' age,
I'm gonna get laughed at.
But if I don't call in
a 98mileanhour f astball,
I'm gonna get fir ed.
I'm just letting you know
that there's a chance
you might get a call
on this.
You figur e out what I saw out
ther e today,
you let me know, okay?
Okay.

Hey, hon,
don't fix dinner.
We're getting some pizza.
Oh, thank God.

Jim, this is Dan Jordan
with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
I'll try you back later.

Man #2: Jim, Mark Raf us with
the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
Dave Patterson told me
about this afternoon.
I'll try you first thing
in the morning.

Hey, Jim, this is Dave.
Listen, uh...
We're gonna have you throw
again in a couple of days
just to make sure.
They're gonna send out
some of the boys f rom Tampa.

Mommy!
Daddy told me
to give you the pizza
and not say anything else.
Thank you, sweet pea.
I'm sur e that's exactly
what he told you.

All right.
All right, go. Go ahead.
There was, like,
a thousand players,
and it was so hot.
And Daddy was pitching
really hard.
__ Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
__ And it was really hot,
but it was f un.
__ Yeah.
__ And I got my nose burned
really bad.
__ Yeah.
Hmm.
The guy thought that the
damn radar gun was broken.
Do you know how many guys
can throw the ball
98 miles an hour?
Not many.
You can count 'em
on one hand.
I still don't believe it.
I mean, those ar e majorleague
scouts on our message machine.
I know.
It's gr eat.
Um, listen, honey, wwhy didn't
you tell me about all this?
Well, I just...
thought you'd laugh at me.
Oh, come on.
It was just this __
it was this thing to get
the kids to start playing.
I thought I'd just go ther e,
I'd throw a f ew pitches,
then I'd be done with it.
So...
are you considering this?
Il don't know.
I __ Il don't know.
I...l have never thrown
that hard bef or e.
What?
Hmm?
Yyou don't seem
too ex cited.
No, I am.
Really.



It's a tough decision.
Do you go ahead and call in
your setup man
to try to counter
the lefthanded batter
with the
lefty middlereliever?
Announcer #2: 
That's right, Tom.
They have Johnson available
as well as Bisou,
who did work one f ull inning
on Tuesday night.
Yup, now it appears they've
made up their minds...
And they're gonna go
the setup route.
And here comes Gray
out of the bullpen,
making the traditional run
through the outfield
to the mound.
You know, Jim, I'm sure
no matter how many times
you've made that run,
it still has to be
quite a thrill.
Right you are, Jim.
Back to the action.






Ain't nothing wrong
with that one right ther e.


So much f or his arm
f alling off, huh?





Jimmy?
Yeah __ yes, sir.

I was just driving by.
I saw that...
Your light was on.
It'll be on
f or a f ew mor e hours.
You want to come in?
Oh, no.
That's all right.
I was, um __
I got to be heading back.
I just, uh, wanted to,
um...

__ Uh __
__ Lorri called.
Yeah?
Guess the scouts saw
what they wanted to see.
Well...
I don't know what to do.

Give it some time.

I haven't got
a lot of that.
You'r e asking me?



Yes, sir.
Your grandf ather
once told me
it was okay to think about
what you want to do,
until it was time to start doing
what you wer e meant to do.
That may not be
what you wanted to hear.

Good night, Jimmy.
Good night.
I swear, sometimes I think
he lies in bed at night
just figuring out the one thing
that he can say
that hurts the most.
I was this close
to thinking
he was gonna give me
some good advice.
Maybe he did.
What?
Oh, boy. 
Listen, Jimmy, I love you.
Lord knows I think it's gr eat
you going out ther e
and showing up the kids
at the tryout.
But I'm a little concerned that
you might be losing sight
of the f act you have a f amily
who needs you
and a pretty decent job waiting
for you up at Fort Worth.
For the r ecord, all right,
I never said
I was gonna do this.
Oh, come on, Jimmy.
I know you.
Although I was hoping f or
a little bit mor e support
on the home f ront.
Oh, so this doesn't concern
me...or the kids?
You can't eat dr eams,
Jimmy.
And they don't pay f or clothes
or shoes or gas or babysitters.
Now, I do not want to be
the bad guy in this,
but somebody around here
has got to start
being rational.
You know what?!
That's all I've been
my whole lif e!
Yeah,
what about my lif e?!
I was there, too,
remember?
Every time you got hurt,
I got a f rontrow seat
to watch you shut yourself off
f rom the r est of the world...
And f rom me.
Truth is,
I was happy when you quit.
Happy.
Yeah...
Because I don't want to see you
get hurt again.



Kids down?
For a while, at least.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Me too.

I've been thinking __
So have l.
I think you should do this.
No. No.
You wer e right.
No. I don't think so.
We've got an 8yearold boy
inside this house
who waited all day in the sun
and the rain
to see his daddy
try to do something
that nobody believed
he could do.
Now, what are we telling him
if __
if you don't try now?

I can't leave you her e
with all this.
Jimmy Morris,
I'm a Texas woman.
Which means I don't need
the help of a man
to keep things running.
Okay?
Okay.

Okay.
Gr eat.




See you soon, little man.



Ex cuse me.
Ex cuse me.
You the old guy?
I'm the old guy.
Come on, Rays,
you're on a roll!
Man #2: Hey, Big Time.
You use a walker
to get to the mound,
or do the other players
carry you?
Man #3: Hey, Pitch, who'd you

Man #5:
What are they paying you?
Man #5: They ought to pay us

I can't believe they let

Well, how'd you do?
Not bad.
I had a f ew of 'em
get away f rom me.
Did the f ans all yell
when you ran in?
Yeah. Oh, yeah,
they wer e yelling, all right.
Oh, honey,
that's just gr eat.
Hey, let me get the kids.
Uh, no. Um...

Okay,

No, it's not 17.
You're guessing.
Just add it up.
It's 16.
You got to be able to look at
f our times f our,
and just know that it's 16
without even having to think
about it, all right?
Now let's do your fives.
Aw, Daddy,
I already done my fives.
__ What's __

Well, if you want to learn
how to multiply,
you'r e gonna have
to practice, bud.
Okay.
__ Hey, Dad.

Told you when you'r e going
to the big leagues yet?

Could you put your mom on?
Okay?
Okay.
All right.
Oh, thanks, hon.
Hey.
Jessie says they left you in
one too many pitches.
Jessie needs to learn how to
keep a secr et with her f ather.
__ How ar e things going?
__ Things are good.
Hunter's got a field trip

and the rest of us
are talking about __
Honey,

I know.
It's not bad.
We'r e a little behind.
How much?
Well, they took the bed,
but they left the nightstand.

You all right?
I'm just tired.

I love you.
Love you, too.
Good night.
Okay. Good night.
Good night.

Listen, man...
This is the only
longdistance phone
we have her e at The Ritz.
You see someone waiting, you
keep it to 10 minutes, okay?
What?
Now you all talked out?
Use it all up
on your girlf riend?
It was my son.
He needed help
with his homework.



Get out of her e.
It looks like a little screen
time's coming for Kenny Justin.

Jim!
Hey, Jim,

Jim, I want you to meet
Tim Stewart f rom "ABC News. "
Hey, Jim. It's a pleasur e.
Thanks f or taking some time

You want to sit down?
I got a jersey for you.
Can you believe that?
I go fourforfive last night
and look where they got
the camera.
Man's been pitching good enough
to talk about it.
Dude's old enough.
He needs to talk
about retiring.
Come on, let's go.

Player #2:
Hey, grab my magazine.
Old Man River,
you'r e moving kind of slow.
Yeah.
Six hours on a bus.
Yeah?
Never mind.
Come on, man.
Look, I got just the r ecipe
to loosen them bones up.

Here you go.
Gentlemen...
To the diet that put Babe Ruth
in the Hall Of f ame.
Hey, River, what was it like
watching The Babe play?
Mmhmm. Okay.
You sur e
you want to start this?
How many f ans
did you guys lose
when you raised ticket prices
to 50 cents?
Not as many as we lose
when you pitch.
Ohhhh!
And this game is over, baby!
River, I swear, if you were
this f unny all the time,
nobody'd say nothing __
About what?
What do you mean?
What ar e they saying,
Brooks?
Look, some of the guys figur e,

with it, okay?
I'll be fine.
You still love it?
Just think about that,
okay?



Charles Gibson:

Finally tonight,
dreams that don't die.
In 1983,
the Milwaukee Brewers
drafted a pitcher
named Jim Morris.
You've never heard of him __
arm troubles.
He quickly dropped out of
baseball, married, had kids,
taught high school chemistry.
Pitching batting practice
to the highschool kids,
he found he was throwing
the ball 95 miles an hour __
f aster than he could throw it
years ago.
He doesn't know
how that happened.
But guess what it did
to his dr eam?
Here's Aaron Brown.
Aaron Brown: 
Jim Morris is af raid
to tell his mother
he quit his old job
as a highschool teacher
for his new one, a relief
pitcher in the minor leagues.
He is really old __
too old to be in the minors __
but he's also throwing harder
and better
than he did
as a 20yearOld kid,
and so he's back in that
strange and wonderf ul land
called minorleague baseball,
where the bull snorts smoke
on every home run,
and f uture stars
run the bases between innings.

I made a challenge to the guys
to, uh, follow their dreams.
Really, it was something to...
to motivate them.
And, uh, they turned it around
on me
and, uh, told me I wasn't
f ollowing my own dr eams.
## ...And washed
the spider out ##
Be quiet.
Listen to Mr. Morris.
Uh, ll grew up here.
I had a lot
of really good support
f rom my f amily and f riends
and townspeople around there.
This game, it's been the true
love of my life,
other than my wife Lorri,
uh, since, uh,
I was a little boy.
I had a dream as a little boy
of playing
professional baseball.
I used to pitch
and imagine myself, you know,
Iike every other kid
in this country,
of being in the World Series,
pitching in the seventh game,
ninth inning,
bigleague ballpark.
Ther e's drama in it.
Ther e's, uh, suspense.
Ther e's a camaraderie
with the other players,
the f ans in the stadium.
You add that to it.
It's __ It's a great game.




Heads up out there!
Heads up!
Man #2: Energy up, now.
Come on, boys!

Ready to play!
Come on!
Riv!

You know what we get to do
today, Brooks?
We get to play baseball.

Morris really on top
of his game.
Coach is r eally bringing it

Strike!
Called strike three.
Caught him looking

That's Morris's third strikeout
of the evening.



Infield! lnfield!
I got it! I got it!
Yeah!



Thanks f or cleaning up my mess
tonight.
Hey, you pitched
seven good innings.
I wouldn't call that a mess.
Jimmy.
Uh, go ahead
and close the door.
Jimmy, I just got off the phone
with the big club.
They'r e calling up Brooks.
That's gr eat.
He won't be back.
He respects you and...
I thought you might want to be
the one to tell him.
Sur e.
Being as that you'r e going,
too.
They'r e calling me up?
Two of you fly out of here
tonight.
You catch up with the team
tomorrow.

Wher e?
Well, they're on the road
right now...
In Texas.


Hello?
Hey, Lorri.
Hey, you.
Hey.
Uh, um, do you know that blue
sport coat that I never wear?

Oh, hang on a sec, hon.
I'm boiling over.


Now, what about the blue sport
coat you never wear?
Would you mind bringing it
to Arlington tomorrow?
Arlington?
I thought you wer e in __
You tell me right now,
Jimmy Morris.
Uh, appar ently...
Ther e's a dr ess code
in the major leagues.
Lorri?

Yeah, I'm her e.

They'r e flying me out

Can you tell everybody?
Sur e. You just have to tell
one person first.
Hunter?
Your daddy's got something
he wants to tell you.
Hey, Dad.
Hey, buddy.
Hey, guess what?
What?
Um, your daddy is gonna be
a majorleague pitcher.
Really?
Yeah, really. What do you
think about that, huh?
Cool.
I can't believe it.
Who are you gonna play for?
They're called
the Devil Rays.
What's a devil ray?
Uh, it __ it's a fish.
What color is it?
Black.
Can you eat it?
I don't know, bud.
It's got a stinger.
That's cool.
My daddy's
a bigleague pitcher.



Coach Morris made it!
