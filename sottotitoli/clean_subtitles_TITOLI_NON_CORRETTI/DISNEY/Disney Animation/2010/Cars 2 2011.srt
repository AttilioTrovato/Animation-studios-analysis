This is Agent Leland Turbo. 
I have a flash transmission
for Agent Finn McMissile. 
Finn, my cover's been compromised.
Everything's gone pearshaped. 
You won't believe
what I found out here. 
This is bigger than anything we've ever seen,
and no one even knows it exists. 
Finn, I need backup, but don't call the cavalry,
it could blow the operation. 
And be careful. It's not safe out here.
Let's go. 
Transmitting my grids now.
Good luck. 
All right, buddy, we're here.
Right where you paid me to bring you.
Question is, why?
I'm looking for a car.
A car? Ha!
Hey, pal, you can't get any further away
from land than out here.
Exactly where I want to be.
I got news for you, buddy.
There's nobody out here but us.
What are you doing out here?
What does it look like, genius?
I'm crabbing.
Well, turn around and go back
where you came from.
Yeah, and who's gonna make me?
All right. All right.
Don't get your prop in a twist.
What a jerk. Sorry, buddy.
Looks like it's the end of the line.
Buddy?
Incoming.
All workers report to the loading dock. 
Leland Turbo, this is Finn McMissile.
I'm at the rally point. Over.
All right, fellas, you know the drill.
Leland, it's Finn. Please respond. Over.
Come on, guys.
These crates aren't gonna unload themselves.
Too many cars here.
Out of my way. 
Professor ZÃ¼ndapp?
Here it is, Professor.
You wanted to see this before we load it?
Yes. Very carefully.
A TV camera.
What does it actually do?
This camera is extremely dangerous.
What are you up to now, Professor?
This is valuable equipment.
Make sure it is properly secured for the voyage.
You got it.
Hey, Professor Z! 
This is one of those British spies
we told you about.
Yeah! This one we caught sticking
his bumper where it didn't belong.
Agent Leland Turbo.
It's Finn McMissile!
He's seen the camera! Kill him!
All hands on deck!
All hands on deck! 
What?
Get to the boats!
He's getting away!
Not for long!
He's dead, Professor. 
Wunderbar! 
With Finn McMissile gone,
who can stop us now?
Mater, Tow Mater, that's who,
is here to help you.
Hey, Otis!
Hey, Mater.
I... Gosh. I'm so sorry.
I thought I could make it this time, but...
Smooth like pudding, huh?
Who am I kidding?
I'll always be a lemon.
Well, dadgum, you're leaking oil again.
Must be your gaskets.
Hey, but look on the bright side.
This is your tenth tow this month,
so it's on the house.
You're the only one that's nice
to lemons like me, Mater.
Don't sweat it.
Shoot, these things happen to everybody.
But you never leak oil.
Yeah, but I ain't perfect.
Don't tell nobody, but I think my rust
is starting to show through.
Hey. Is Lightning McQueen back yet?
Not yet.
He must be crazy excited about
winning his fourth Piston Cup.
Four! Wow!
Yeah, we're so dadgum proud of him,
but I wish he'd hurry up and get back,
'cause we got a whole summer's worth
of best friend fun to make up for.
Just me and...
McQueen!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
McQueen!
Mater! I'm in no hurry!
Hey, everybody. McQueen's back!
McQueen's back!
McQueen's back! McQueen's back!
McQueen's back!
Lightning! Welcome home!
Good to have you back, honey!
Congratulations, man.
Welcome home, soldier.
The place wasn't the same
without you, son.
What? Did he go somewhere?
It's good to be home, everybody.
Mater!
McQueen!
Mater!
McQueen!
Hey, how far did you
make it this time, Otis?
Halfway to the county line.
Not bad, man!
I know! I can't believe it either!
McQueen! Welcome back!
Mater, it's so good to see you.
You too, buddy.
Man, you ain't going to believe
the things I got planned for us!
These best friend greetings
get longer every year!
You ready to have some serious fun?
I've got something to show you first.
Wow.
I can't believe they
renamed the Piston Cup
after our very own Doc Hudson.
I know Doc said these things
were just old cups,
but to have someone else win it
just didn't feel right, you know?
Doc would've been real proud of you.
That's for sure.
All right, pal.
I've been waiting all summer for this.
What you got planned?
You sure you can handle it?
Do you know who you're talking to?
This is Lightning McQueen!
I can handle anything.
Mater?
Just remember, your brakes
ain't going to work on these!
Mater?
Relax.
These train tracks
ain't been used in years!
Faster, faster. Come on.
Here we go!
Faster!
Wow.
Yeah, I don't know. Do you think?
This is going to be good!
Did you see that?
This ain't going to be good.
Boy, this was the best day ever!
And my favorite souvenir,
this new dent.
Boy, Mater, today was...
Shoot, that was nothing.
Wait till you see what
I got planned for tonight!
Mater, Mater, whoa!
I was thinking of just a quiet dinner.
That's exactly what I was thinkin'.
No, I meant with Sally, Mater.
Even better!
You, me and Miss Sally
goin' out for supper.
Mater, I meant it would be
just me and Sally.
You know, just for tonight.
We'll do whatever you want tomorrow.
Okay.
Thanks for understanding.
Yeah, sure.
Y'all go on and have fun now.
All right, then.
See you soon, amigo.
This is so nice.
I can't tell you how good
it is to be here alone,
just the two of us, finally.
You and me.
Good evening.
My name is Mater,
and I'll be your waiter.
Mater the waiter.
That's funny right there.
Mater? You work here?
Yeah, I work here. What'd you think?
I snuck in here when nobody was lookin'
and pretended to be your waiter
so I could hang out with you?
Oh, yeah.
How ridiculous would that be?
Can I start you two lovebirds off
with a couple of drinks?
Yes. I'll have my usual.
You know what? I'll have that, too.
Right. Your usual.
Thanks, man.
Grazie , Guido.
Guido, what's McQueen's usual?
How should I know?
Perfect. Give me two of them.
Quiet! My programme's on.
Tonight on the Mel Dorado Show... 
His story gripped the world. 
Oil billionaire Miles Axlerod, 
in an attempt to become the first car
to circumnavigate the globe without GPS, 
ironically ran out of gas,
and found himself trapped in the wild. 
Feared dead,
he emerged 36 days later, 
running on a fuel he distilled himself
from the natural elements! 
Since then, he's sold his oil fortune, 
converted himself from a gasguzzler
into an electric car 
and has devoted his life to finding
a renewable, cleanburning fuel. 
Now he claims to have
done it with his allinol. 
And to show the world
what his new super fuel can do 
he's created a racing competition
like no other, 
inviting the greatest champions 
to battle in the first ever
World Grand Prix. 
Welcome, Sir Miles Axlerod.
Thank you, Mel. It is good to be here.
Listen to me.
Big oil. It costs a fortune.
Pollution is getting worse.
I mean, it's a fossil fuel.
"Fossil," as in dead dinosaurs.
And we all know
what happened to them.
Alternative energy is the future.
Trust me, Mel.
After seeing allinol in action
at the World Grand Prix,
nobody will ever go back
to gasoline again. 
What happened to the dinosaurs, now?
And on satellite,
a World Grand Prix competitor
and one of the fastest cars in the world,
Francesco Bernoulli.
It is an honor, Signore Dorado, for you.
Why not invite Lightning McQueen?
Of course we invited him, 
but apparently after his
very long racing season
he is taking time off to rest.
The Lightning McQueen would not have
a chance against Francesco.
I can go over 300 kilometers an hour.
In miles, that is like...
Way faster than McQueen.
Let's go to the phones.
Baltimore, Maryland, you're on the air.
Am I on? Hello? 
You're on. Go ahead.
Hello? 
Go ahead.
Let's go to Radiator Springs.
You're on, caller.
That Italian feller you got on there 
can't talk that way about
Lightning McQueen. 
He's the bestest race car
in the whole wide world.
If he is, how you say, 
"The bestest race car,"
then why must he rest? Huh?
'Cause he knows what's important. 
Every now and then he prefers
just to slow down, enjoy life. 
You heard it!
Lightning McQueen prefers to be slow!
This is not news to Francesco.
When I want to go to sleep,
I watch one of his races.
After two laps, I am out cold. 
That ain't what I meant.
What's going on over there?
He is afraid of Francesco. 
That's that Italian formula car.
His name is...
Francesco Bernoulli.
No wonder there's a crowd.
Why do you know his name?
And don't say it like that.
It's three syllables, not 10.
What? He's nice to look at.
You know, openwheeled and all.
What's wrong with fenders?
I thought you liked my fenders.
Let me tell you something else. 
Mater?
McQueen could drive circles around you. 
Driving in circles is all he cana do, no?
No. 
I mean, yes.
I mean, he could beat you anywhere.
Any time, any track.
Mel, can we move on?
Francesco needs a caller
who can provide
a little more intellectual stimulation,
like a dump truck. 
That shows what you know.
Dump trucks is dumb.
Hey! Whoa!
Yeah, hi. This is Lightning McQueen.
The Lightning McQueen, huh?
I don't appreciate my best friend
being insulted like that. 
McQueen, that was your best friend?
This is the difference
between you and Francesco.
Francesco knows how good he is.
He does not need to surround himself
with tow trucks to prove it.
Those are strong words
from a car that is so fragile.
Fragile! He calls Francesco fragile!
Not so fast, McQueen!
"Not so fast."
Is that your new motto?
Motto?
This sounds like something that needs
to be settled on the race course.
What do you say, Lightning McQueen?
We've got room for one more racer.
I would love to,
but my crew is off for the season, so...
Pit stop.
You know what? They just got back.
Deal me in, baby.
Kachow! Yeah.
I know, I know.
I just got back, but we won't be long.
No, don't worry about me.
I've got enough to do here.
Mater's going to have a blast, though.
You're bringing Mater, right?
You never bring him
to any of your races.
Just let him sit in the pits.
Give him a headset.
Come on, it will be the thrill
of a lifetime for him.
Your drink, sir.
Mater.
I didn't taste it!
How'd you like to come
and see the world with me?
You mean it?
Yeah. You got me into this thing.
You're coming along.
All right!
Kachow!
Hey!
Excuse me!
Domo arigato! 
Yeah!
Guido, look. Ferraris and tyres.
Let's go!
Look at this.
Okay, now, Mater, remember,
best behavior.
You got it, buddy. Hey, what's that?
Mater!
Hey, McQueen! Over here.
Lewis!
Hey, man.
Jeff!
Hey, Lightning.
Can you believe this party?
Hey.
You done good.
You got all the leaves.
Check out that tow truck.
Man, I wonder who that guy's with.
Will you guys excuse me
just for one little second?
Good job!
Mater!
Listen, this isn't Radiator Springs.
You're just realizing that?
That jet lag really done
a number on you.
Mater, things are different over here.
Which means maybe you should,
you know, act a little different, too.
Different than what?
Well, just help me out here.
You need help? Shoot!
Why didn't you say so?
That's what a tow truck does.
Yeah, I mean...
Looky there.
It's Mr. San Francisco.
I'll introduce you.
Mater, no!
Look at me. I'm helping you already.
Hey, Mr. San Francisco,
I'd like you to meet...
Lightning McQueen! Buona sera. 
Nice to meet you, Francesco.
Nice to meet you, too.
You are very goodlooking.
Not as good as I thought, but good.
Excuse me.
Can I get a picture with you?
Anything for McQueen's friend.
Miss Sally is going to flip
when she sees this.
She's Lightning McQueen's girlfriend.
She's a big fan of yours.
Hey, she hasa good taste.
Mater's prone to exaggeration.
I wouldn't say she's a "big fan".
You're right. She's a huge fan!
She goes on and on
about your open wheels.
Mentioning it once doesn't qualify
as going on and on.
Francesco is familiar
with this reaction to Francesco.
Women respect a car
that hasa nothing to hide.
Yeah...
Let us have a toast.
Let's.
I dedicate my win tomorrow
to Miss Sally.
Sorry.
I already dedicated
my win tomorrow to her.
So, if we both do it,
it's really not so special.
Besides, I don't have a drink.
I'll go get you one.
Do you mind if I borrow a few bucks
for one of them drinks?
They're free.
Free? Shoot, what am I doing here?
I should probably go keep an eye on him.
See you at the race.
Yes, you will see Francesco,
but not like this.
You will see him likea this
as he drives away from you.
That's cute.
You had one of those made up
for all the racers?
No.
Okay.
Ciao, McQueen!
He is so getting beat tomorrow!
Ladies and gentlecars,
Sir Miles Axlerod. 
It is my absolute honor
to introduce to you
the competitors in the first ever
World Grand Prix.
From Brazil, Number 8...
Hello.
Hello.
A Volkswagen Karmann Ghia
has no radiator.
That's because it's aircooled.
Great. I'm Agent Shiftwell.
Holley Shiftwell from the Tokyo station.
I have a message from London.
Not here.
Try the canapÃ©s on the mezzanine.
The lab boys analyzed the photo I sent?
What did they learn about the camera?
It appears to be a standard
television camera.
They said if you could get closer photos
next time that would be great.
This was London's message?
No. No, sir.
The oil platforms you were on,
turns out they're sitting on
the biggest oil reserve in the world.
How did we miss that?
They've scrambled everyone's satellites.
The Americans discovered it
just before you did.
They placed an agent on that
platform under deep cover.
He was able to get a photo of the car
who's running the entire operation.
Great.
Who is it?
Has anyone seen the photo yet?
Nope, not yet.
The American is here tonight
to pass it to you.
He'll signal you when he's ready.
Good, good.
Oh, no.
What is it?
Change of plan.
You're meeting the American.
What? Me?
Those thugs down there
were on the oil platform.
If they see me,
the mission is compromised.
No, I'm technical. I'm in diagnostics.
I'm... I'm not a field agent.
You are now.
I'll take one of them. Thank you.
Never know which one McQueen
will have a hankering for.
Hey. What you got here that's free?
How about that pistachio ice cream?
No, no, wasabi.
Same old same old.
What's up with you?
That looks delicious!
Little more, please. It is free, right?
Keep it coming. A little more.
Come on, let's go. It's free.
You're gettin' there. Scoop, scoop.
There ya go!
Now that's a scoop of ice cream!
My condolences.
And now our last competitor.
Number 95, Lightning McQueen!
Kachow!
Thank you so much
for having us, Sir Axlerod.
I really look forward to racing.
This is a great opportunity.
The pleasure is all ours, Lightning.
You and your team bring
excellence and professionalism
to this competition.
Somebody get me water!
Sweet relief. Sweet relief.
Whatever you do,
do not eat the free pistachio ice cream.
It has turned.
Sir Axlerod, I can explain.
This is Mater. He's...
I know him.
This is the bloke that called in
to the television show.
You're the one I have to thank.
No, thank you.
This trip's been amazin'.
He's a little excited, isn't he?
Mater!
But wait, I... Shoot.
Mater.
Has anyone got a towel?
Mater, get a hold of yourself.
You're making a scene!
But I never leak oil. Never.
Go take care of yourself right now!
Comin' through! Leakin' oil.
Where's the bathroom? Thank you.
I gotta go.
Sorry, ladies.
I'm leakin'.
I never leak. I never leak.
I never leak, I never leak, I never leak.
I never leak.
I never leak, I never leak, never...
Wowwee!
What in the...
Hey, that tickles!
Okay, McMissile. I'm here.
It's time for the drop.
Okay, so, the American
has activated his tracking beacon.
Roger that. Move in.
Stop! Hey!
You've got to be joking.
What's the problem?
He's in the loo.
So, go in! 
I can't go into the men's loo!
Time is of the essence. 
All right.
Whatever you do,
I would not go in there!
Hey! A Gremlin and a Pacer!
No offense to your makes and models,
but you break down harder
than my cousin Betsy
after she got left at the altar!
What the... Whoa. Are you okay?
I'm fine.
Hey! Tow truck!
We'd like to get to our private business here,
if you don't mind.
Yeah, sorry.
Don't let me get in the way
of your private business.
A little advice. When you hear
a giggle and see that waterfall,
you best press that green button.
Thank you.
It's to adjust the temperature.
Got it.
And it's in Celsius, not Fahrenheit.
Get out of here!
All right, then. And when she starts gigglin',
prepare to be squirted.
'Scuse me, ma'am.
Dadgum pistachio ice cream.
This cannot be him.
Is he American? 
Look out, ladies.
Mater's fittin' to get funky.
Extremely.
Then it's him. 
Hello.
Well, hello.
A Volkswagen Karmann Ghia
has no radiator.
Well, of course it doesn't.
That's 'cause it's aircooled.
Perfect. I'm from the Tokyo Station.
'Course, Karmann Ghias
weren't the only ones.
Besides the Beetles, you had Type 3
Squarebacks with the Pancake motors.
Yeah, okay. I get it.
And before both of them
there's the Type 2 buses.
My buddy Fillmore's one of them.
Listen!
We should find somewhere more private.
Gee, don't you think that's a little...
You're right. Impossible to know
which areas here are compromised.
So, when can I see you again?
Well, let's see.
Tomorrow I'll be out there at the races.
Got it.
We'll rendezvous then.
There you are. Where have you been?
What's a "rendezvous"?
It's like a date.
A date?
Mater, what's going on?
What's going on is
I got me a date tomorrow.
Guido don't believe you.
Believe it.
My new girlfriend just said so.
Hey, there she is. Hey! Hey, lady!
See you tomorrow!
Guido still don't believe you.
I got to admit,
you tricked us real good.
And we don't like being tricked.
What's so funny?
Well, I was just wearing a disguise.
You guys are stuck looking like that.
Allinol? Thanks, fellas.
I hear this stuff is good for you.
So you think.
Allinol by itself is good for you.
But after microscopic examination
I have found that it has
one small weakness.
When hit with an electromagnetic pulse,
it becomes extremely dangerous.
Smile for the camera.
Is that all you want?
I got a whole act.
You were very interested
in this camera on the oil platform.
Now, you will witness
what it really does.
Whatever you say, Professor.
You talked up a lot of cars last night.
Which one's your associate?
Your mother.
No, I'm sorry, it was your sister.
I can't tell them apart these days.
Could I start it now, Professor Z?
Go 50% power.
This camera is actually
an electromagnetic pulse emitter.
What about her?
Did you give it to her?
The allinol is now heating to a boil,
dramatically expanding, causing
the engine block to crack under the stress,
forcing oil into the combustion chamber.
How about him? Did you talk to him?
What do I care?
I can replace an engine block.
You may be able to,
but after full impact of the pulse,
unfortunately,
there will be nothing to replace.
How about him? Does he have it?
That's him. He's the one.
Roger that, Professor Z.
No!
Yes, sir.
We believe the infiltrator has passed
along sensitive information.
I will take care of it
before any damage can be done.
The project is still on schedule.
You will find the second agent and kill him.
Japan, land of the rising sun, 
where ancient tradition
meets modern technology. 
Welcome to the inaugural running
of the World Grand Prix. 
I'm Brent Mustangburger
with racing legends
Darrell Cartrip and David Hobbscap.
There's never been
a competition like this before.
First, allinol, making its debut tonight
as the required fuel
for all these great champions.
Second, the course itself.
And it's like nothing
we've ever seen before.
David, how exactly
does this competition work? 
All three of these street courses
are classic roundthehouse racetracks. 
This means that the LMP
and formula cars 
should break out of the gate
in spectacular fashion. 
Look for Francesco Bernoulli,
in particular, to lead early. 
And with technical turns throughout,
GT and touring cars, 
like Spain's Miguel Camino,
should make up ground 
but I doubt it'll be enough
to stop Francesco 
from absolutely running away with it.
Whoa now. Hold your horsepower.
You forget the most important factor,
that early dirt track section
of the course.
The dirt is supposed to be
the equalizer in this race. 
French rally car Raoul ÃaRoule 
is counting on
a big boost through there. 
And don't forget Lightning McQueen. 
His mentor, the Hudson Hornet, 
was one of the greatest
dirt track racers of all time. 
In my opinion, McQueen is the best
allaround racer in this competition.
Really, Darrell,
you need to clean your windshield.
You're clearly not seeing this for what it is:
Francesco's race to lose.
It's time to find out.
The racers are locking into the grid. 
Speed. I am speed.
Really? You are speed?
Then Francesco is triple speed.
Francesco is triple speed.
Francesco likesa this McQueen.
It'sa really getting him into the zone.
He is so getting beat today.
Your suspension sets look good.
Tyre pressure is excellent!
He's got plenty of fuel.
And he's awesome.
Why is he in the pits?
He's so exposed.
It's his cover.
One of the best I've seen, too.
Look at the detail on that rust.
It must have cost him a fortune.
But why hasn't he contacted us yet?
There's probably heat on him.
Be patient.
Right, of course.
He'll signal us when he can.
Then we find out who's behind all this.
As they head into the palace hairpin,
Francesco builds an early lead. 
Hang on, boys. Here comes the dirt. 
Slipping and sliding, baby. 
McQueen, it's time to make your move!
Get on the outside and show 'im
what Doc taught you.
104, Mater.
Oh, boy!
Francesco's brought to a screeching halt! 
Lightning McQueen is the first
to take advantage. 
And just like that, folks,
Francesco's lead is left in the dust. 
Nice call, Mater. Keep it up.
McQueen looks happier than
a roll bar at a demolition derby! 
Everyone's jostling for position
as we hit the asphalt again. 
Francesco lost a lot of
momentum in the dirt. 
He's got serious work ahead of him
if he wants to get back in this race. 
The racers hit the Rainbow Bridge,
with its 360degree loop. 
It is time. 
Roger that.
Miguel Camino has blown an engine! 
Very unusual, Darrell.
He's been so consistent all year. 
You gotta be kidding me.
What is it?
The tow truck from the bathroom.
The bathroom?
The one the American agent
passed the device to.
What about him?
He's in the pits!
Not for long.
Hold on. I think I've got something.
What is it?
The Pacer from the party last night.
I'm crossreferencing with the photos
from the oil derricks.
Yep. His VIN numbers match.
Anyone with him? He won't be alone.
Conducting analysis on the target.
He's not the only one here.
Three, five... They're everywhere.
And they're all closing in on...
Oh, no! Finn? Finn, where are you?
Get him out of the pits. Now! 
Some of them fellers is really loud!
Can you hear me? Over. 
What?
Get out of the pit now!
Do you hear me? 
Hey. I know you!
You're that girl from the party last night.
You wanna do our date now?
Guys, too much chatter.
Let's keep this line clear.
Smoke from number 10, Clutchgoneski! 
There's no time for messing about!
Get out of the pits! 
Is there going to be cable where you is
so I can watch the rest of the race?
You're running out of time! 
They're coming. Get him out of there!
I'm trying. Get out now.
I usually like to have a proper detailin' done
before I meet a lady friend.
Finn McMissile! But you're dead!
Then this shouldn't hurt.
Miss Shiftwell?
I've got him in the back alleys
east of the garages.
Multiple assailants are closing in quickly.
Keep him moving. I'm on my way.
Hey, new lady friend, you like flowers?
What?
No! Don't go in anywhere.
Just keep moving.
Stay outside. Got you.
Outside?
Whoa! McQueen suddenly
moves to the outside. 
I cannot believe what I saw. 
That was a bonehead move
to open up the inside like that! 
That might have cost
McQueen the victory! 
This time, I'm going
to make sure you stay dead!
You're doing brilliantly.
Now just stay focused. 
What's that?
You want me to head toward that ruckus?
No! Don't go down that street. 
Wow! A live karate demonstration!
Stop it, Mater. Just sign off.
And here they come, the two leaders. 
Bumper to bumper
as they approach the finish line! 
It's close!
Francesco's the winner! 
McQueen's number two. 
That was cool!
Can I get your autograph?
Where did he go?
Our rendezvous has been jeopardized.
Keep the device safe. 
We'll be in touch. 
Dadgum, did I miss our date?
Francesco!
Francesco, over here.
What was your strategy today?
Strategia? 
Francesco needsa no strategy.
It'sa very simple.
You start the race, wait for Lightning McQueen
to choke, pass him, then win.
Francesco alwaysa wins. It'sa boring.
You were in trouble for a while.
That dirt track section had you crawling.
To truly crush one's dream,
you must first raise their hopes very high.
Mater!
Hey, McQueen! What happened?
Is the race over? You won, right?
Why were you yelling at me
while I was racing?
Yelling? You thought...
That's funny right there.
No, that's 'cause I seen these two fellers
doing some karate street performance.
It was nutso.
One of 'em even had a flamethrower.
A flamethrower?
What are you talking about?
I don't understand. Where were you?
Going to meet my date.
Your date?
She started talkin' to me as a voice
in my head, tellin' me where to go.
What?
Wait a minute.
I didn't screw ya up, did I?
I lost the race because of you!
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.
An imaginary girlfriend?
Flamethrowers?
This is exactly why I don't
bring you along to these things.
Maybe if I, I don't know,
talk to somebody and explained
what happened, I could help.
I don't need your help!
I don't want your help!
Hey, there he is!
McQueen, you had it in the bag!
Yeah! What happened?
I made a mistake.
But I can assure you,
it won't happen again.
Look, we know what the problem is
and we've taken care of it. 
Lightning McQueen loses in the last lap
to Francesco Bernoulli 
in the first race of the World Grand Prix. 
And three, count 'em,
three cars flamed out 
leaving some to suggest that their fuel,
allinol, might be to blame. 
Allinol is safe. Alternative fuel is safe.
There is no way my fuel
caused these cars to flame out.
The jury may still be out on whether
allinol caused these accidents,
but one thing's for sure,
Lightning McQueen blew this race. 
Team McQueen can't be happy right now. 
Welcome to Tokyo International Airport. 
Come with me, please, sir.
But I'm 'onna miss my plane.
Right this way.
Doggone it.
This is about my hook, ain't it?
I know I should have checked it,
but I can't, really.
Look. It's attached to me.
Hey, I know you. You're that feller
from the karate demonstration.
I never properly introduced myself.
Finn McMissile. British Intelligence.
Tow Mater. Average intelligence.
Who are you with? FBI? CIA?
Let's just say I'm AAA affiliated.
I know some karate.
I don't want to brag or nuttin',
but I got me a black fan belt.
Wanna see some moves I made up?
You're being followed.
This first one,
I can reach into a car's hood
pull out his battery,
and show it to him before he stalls.
I call it, "What I accidentally did
to my friend Luigi once."
There he is!
Look, I probably ought to go.
I'm about to miss my flight.
Don't worry. I've taken care of that.
Whoa!
Hang on!
This is firstclass service.
You don't even have to go
through the terminal!
Your karate partners is back there.
They look like they tryin' to catch up!
Drive forward.
Whatever you do, don't stop!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Is everything okay back there?
Finn, it's Sid. I'm on approach.
Roger that. 
'Member that whole thing about me
not stoppin' no matter what?
I knew I shoulda done carryon!
Thanks, old boy.
You got it, mate.
Hey, doggonit!
Look, it's my imaginary girlfriend!
Come on! Get in here!
I tell you what, you really do want
this first date, don't ya?
That's a noquit attitude right there.
What the...
Hold on, Sid.
Come on, Finn! It's now or never!
Hold on!
By the time you read this,
I will be safely on an aeroplane flying home. 
I'm so sorry for what I did. 
"I don't want to be the cause
of you losing any more races.
"I want you to go prove to the world
what I already know.
"That you are the greatest race car
in the whole wide world.
"Your best friend, Mater."
I didn't really want him to leave.
Wait, there's more here.
"PS. Please tell the hotel
"I didn't mean to order that movie.
"I thought it was just a preview
and I didn't realize I was paying for it.
"PPS. That's funny right there. PP."
There are a few more
pages of PS's here.
Well, at least I know if he's at home,
he'll be safe.
That's how I like to start the day.
You never feel more alive
than when you're almost dead.
Yeah. I hope that device didn't fall off.
Whoa!
That's the closest I ever been
to missin' my flight.
That was...
Still in one piece? Great.
I've got to go to a doctor.
I get these sharp pains
in my undercarriage.
Downloading the photo now.
Let me introduce you two.
This here is Finn McSomethin' or other.
He's a firstclass VIP
airport whatchamacallit.
And, Finn, this here is my date.
I never did get your name.
Yes, sorry. It's Shiftwell.
Holley Shiftwell.
It's Shiftwell. Holley...
Finally.
Time to see who's behind all this.
What is this?
That's one of the worst
engines ever made.
It's an old aluminium V8 with a Lucas
electrical system and Whitworth bolts.
Shoot, them Whitworth bolts
is a pain, tell you what.
Them ain't metric, they ain't inches.
Yes, okay, but whose engine is this?
It's kinda hard to tell
from this picture, ain't it?
But you took it.
Holley.
Right! Yes, of course.
A good agent gets what he can,
then gets out before he's killed.
Agent? You mean, like,
insurance agent? Like...
Like a good neighbour, Mater is there! 
Wait! You mean secret agents!
You guys is spies!
In how many makes and models
did this type of engine appear?
It was standard in seven models
over a 12year period.
At least 35,000 cars
were made with this engine.
You're purty.
Yes, thank you.
And so nice.
Just pay attention.
This seems like a dead end.
If there was something in the photo
that could narrow this down,
I'd be happier.
You might not be happy,
but I bet this feller is.
See how he's had most
of his parts replaced?
And see all them boxes over there?
Them's all original parts.
They ain't easy to come by.
Rare parts?
That's something we can track.
Exactly.
Well done, Mater.
I would never have seen that.
I know of a blackmarket parts dealer in Paris,
a treacherous lowlife,
but he's the only car in the world
who can tell us whose engine this is.
What would you say to setting up
an informal task force on this one?
Wait. What?
You obviously have
experience in the field.
Yeah, I live right next to one.
I don't know.
I ain't exactly been much help
to anybody recently.
You're helping me. Please, Mater.
Well... Okay.
But you know I'm just
a tow truck, right?
Right. And I'm just
in the importexport business.
Siddeley?
Yes, Finn?
Paris. Tout de suite. 
Yeah, two of them sweets
for me, too, Sid.
I always wanted to be a spy.
Really? Me, too.
Afterburners, sir?
Is there any other way?
Once we're inside, stay close.
Don't bother checking VIN numbers.
They're all dodgy here.
Got it.
Don't talk to anyone,
don't look at anyone,
and absolutely, positively no idling.
Are we clear?
Yes. No idling. Yes, sir.
Mater?
Yeah, Finn?
We're not here to go shopping.
Shoppin'? What do you mean?
Why would I...
Dadgum.
Part for sales, monsieur.
Monsieur, part for sale.
They got everything here. No!
Look at them hoods!
I could use a hood.
Sorry, fellers. I gotta go!
Do what?
Excuse me. What are you selling?
Headlights, monsieur, headlights?
What in the...
Two for one.
I give you good price!
I'm good!
There you are.
There is some great bargains here.
Mater, get back!
ImbÃ©cile! 
Hey, wait for me!
Have you lost your mind?
But I thought...
This chap needs a tow.
Hook him up.
Sure thing.
You rusty piece of junk!
Get your dirty hook off me!
Electroshock! Are you kidding me?
This is her first field assignment. She
didn't know you were my informant.
Informant?
A rookie, huh?
I never liked new car smell.
Tomber was doing 20tolife
in a Moroccan impound
the first time I saved him,
if I recall correctly.
Speaking of recalls, you're getting
up there in mileage, aren't you?
All right, we get it.
You both know each other, you're both old.
So, here you go, informant. Inform us.
That is the worst motor ever made.
Wait. That oil filter.
Those wheel bearings.
Do those parts look familiar, Tomber?
They should. I sold them.
To whom?
No idea.
He's my best customer, but he always
does his business over the phone.
I was always wondering
why he needs so many parts.
Now I know.
A lemon needs parts.
Ain't nothin' truer than that.
Lemon?
Yeah. Cars that don't ever work right.
Lemons is a tow truck's bread and butter.
Like 'em Gremlins and Pacers
we run into at the party
and the race and the airport.
Pull up the pictures
from the oil platform.
I want to know what other
type of cars were out there.
Right. Let's see.
There were Hugos and Trunkovs.
Are these cars considered lemons?
Is the Popemobile Catholic?
Everyone involved in this plot
is one of history's biggest loser cars.
And they're all taking their orders
from the car behind this engine.
This explains it.
What, Tomber?
Gremlin, Pacer, Hugo and Trunkov
never get together,
but they are having
a secret meeting in two days.
Where's this meeting taking place?
Porto Corsa, Italy.
That's where the next race is!
There's a good chance our
mystery engine will be there, too.
Your chances are more than good.
I just sent him a new clutch assembly yesterday.
To Porto Corsa.
Contact Stevenson and have him
meet us at Gare de Lyon.
Good work.
That threewheeled feller
had to be right about a big meetin'.
You never see this many
lemons in one town.
'Less there's a swap meet.
How'd you get all them pictures?
I reprogrammed Porto Corsa's red light
cameras to do recognition scans.
Wow. Not only is you the purtiest car I ever met,
but you're the smartest, too.
Thank you... I think.
That's a familiar sight.
A Hugo bein' towed.
But he looks absolutely perfect!
Of course! They must be
the heads of the lemon families.
Makes sense.
If I was rich and broke down every day,
I'd hire me to tow me around
all the time, too!
We've got to infiltrate that meeting
to find out who's behind all this.
Hang on a minute. Hold still.
Good job, Miss Shiftwell.
Thank you, Finn.
Boy, I sure wish my friends
could see me now.
Guido, your eyes do not deceive you.
We are in Italy. We are home.
Hey, Luigi.
Which way to the hotel, man?
What? No friend of mine
will stay in a hotel ina my village.
You will stay with my...
Uncle Topolino!
Luigi! Guido!
How do they do it?
These are the same ingredients as back home,
but it tastes so good.
It's organic, man.
Treehugger.
Hey, race car.
You look so down, so low.
Is like you have flat tyres.
She said you look like you are starving,
that she's gonna make you
a big meal and fatten you up.
No.
Mama Topolino, please,
you don't need to make a fuss.
Capisco. I understand.
Is a problem, yes,
between you and a friend?
How did you know that?
A wise car hears one word
and understands two.
That, and Luigi told me.
While Mama cooks,
come and take a stroll with me.
I brought my friend Mater
along on the trip
and I told him he needed
to act different,
that we weren't in Radiator Springs.
This Mater is a close friend?
He's my best friend.
Then why would you ask him
to be someone else?
What did I do?
I said some things during our fight.
You know, back when Guido
and Luigi used to work for me,
they would fight over everything.
They fight over what Ferrari
was the best Ferrari,
which one of them looked
more like a Ferrari.
There were even some nonFerrari fights.
So I tell them, "Va bene, 
it's okay to fight.
"Everybody fights now and then,
especially best friends.
"But you got to make up fast.
"No fight more important than friendship."
What does that mean?
Whoever find a friend, find a treasure.
Now, mangia. Eat!
Finn, one hour to Porto Corsa.
Thank you, Stevenson.
That should just about do it.
Perfect.
So, Mater, it's voiceactivated.
But everything's
voiceactivated these days.
What? I thought you was supposed
to be makin' me a disguise.
Voice recognized.
Disguise program initiated. 
Cool!
Computer, make me a German truck.
Request acknowledged. 
Check it out! I'm wearing Materhosen.
Make me a monster truck!
Request acknowledged. 
What the...
I vant to siphon your gas!
Now make me a taco truck!
Request acknowledged. 
A funny car!
Request acknowledged. 
The idea is to keep a low profile, Mater.
So I just go in,
pretend to be this truck.
And leave the rest to us.
Now, hold still.
I have to do the final fitting
on your disguise.
That's no good.
Hey. What are you doin'?
The disguise won't calibrate effectively
without a smooth surface to graft onto.
For a second there,
I thought you was tryin' to fix my dents.
Yes, I was.
Then, no, thank you.
I don't get them dents buffed,
pulled, filled or painted by nobody.
They way too valuable.
Your dents are valuable? Really?
I come by each one of 'em with
my best friend, Lightning McQueen.
I don't fix these.
I wanna remember these dents forever.
So, you were being serious in Paris?
McQueen isn't just part of your cover.
Friendships can be dangerous
in our line of work, Mater.
But my line of work is towin' and salvage.
Right. And Miss Shiftwell's
is designing iPhone apps.
No, I meant for real.
It's okay. I'll work around the dent.
In the meantime,
you look a little light on weapons.
You are looking live at beautiful 
Porto Corsa, Italy,
on the Italian Riviera. 
What a magnificent setting
for the second race of the World Grand Prix! 
Brent, they call this place
the "Gem of the Riviera," 
and it's easy to see why. 
With its secluded beaches
and opulent casinos, 
Porto Corsa truly is a playground
for the wealthy. 
And everyone who's anyone
is here today, 
from the ultrarich and superfamous 
to world leaders and
important dignitaries. 
You aren't kidding, David. 
You can't do a threepoint turn
without bumping into some celebrity. 
Welcome, everyone,
to the second race of the World Grand Prix,
where the big news
continues to be allinol.
Sir Miles Axlerod spoke
to the press earlier today
to answer questions about its safety.
An independent panel of scientists
has determined
that allinol is completely safe, okay?
Safe. There it is.
So the race will go on, folks.
But the question everyone is asking:
will the real Lightning McQueen
show up today? 
He'd better.
Talk about a home track advantage. 
Francesco Bernoulli grew up
racing on this course. 
Signore e signori, in the pole position, 
Numero Uno, Francesco! 
Bellissima! 
Thank you for your support!
And your big mistake, McQueen!
In secondo position, 
numero 95, Lightninga McQueena! 
McQueena, isa everything okay?
If you're worried about your fuel, man, don't.
It's perfectly safe.
No, guys, I just really wish
Mater were here.
Francesco understands, McQueen.
Great, here it comes.
What do you got, Francesco?
For famous race cars
like Francesco and, well, you,
to be far away from home is not easy.
I think you forgot
the insulting part of that insult.
Isa no insult.
Whena Francesco is away from home,
he misses his mama,
just likea you miss
your tow truck amico.
Gee, I maybe misjudged you,
because that's exactly...
Of course, I am at home,
and my mama is right here.
Mama!
Don't worry, Mama, McQueen is very sad.
I will beat his crybaby bottom today!
And there's the insult we were missing.
Darrell, the racers are
settling in as they head 
to the Italian countryside. 
Boy! 
This is going to be a great race. 
Gremlins.
Man, those are some ugly cars.
Look like someone stole their trunks.
My granda father hasa broken down.
Ifa one ofa you would help,
I would be so thankful.
Sounds like you need
some roadside assistance.
She was talking to me.
Really? Prove it.
Don'ta fight over me.
Signore Tow Truck, per favore. 
Get ready, Mater.
You're on any moment now.
I don't know about this.
What if I screw things up?
Impossible. 
Just apply the same level of dedication 
you've been using to play the idiot tow truck,
and you'll be fine. 
It's just that them guys look purty tough and...
Wait, did you say "idiot"?
Is that how you see me?
That's how everyone sees you. 
Isn't that the idea? 
I tell you, that's the genius of it. 
No one realizes they're being fooled 
because they're too busy
laughing at the fool. 
Brilliant! 
Why aren't you in disguise?
I...
Come on! There's no time! Go!
Okay. Okay.
Computer, disguise!
Request acknowledged. 
It's the boss. He's coming.
Ivan.
Ivan, why do you insult me so
by making me wait here?
He's in.
The racers are now making
their way around the hairpin 
and headed downhill
toward the casino bridge. 
No more bets, please.
Come on, fuzzy dice!
Number four. Easy four.
Yeah!
Air freshener. Antenna balls.
Sparka plugs.
This place looks like
it's made outta gold!
That's because it is.
Now, be careful what you say. 
Why is that?
What do you mean, "Don't talk to ya"?
You want me to stop
talkin' to ya right now?
You are acting strange today, Ivan.
I have no idea
what you're talking about,
"Alexander Hugo, aka Chop Shop Alex."
You got a lot of aka's, Alex.
But that makes sense,
seein's how you's wanted in France, Germany...
Mater, stop it!
Okay, okay, keep your voice down!
You gonna make me arrested!
Don't mess with Ivan today.
He's in a bad mood.
He's so good!
Victor!
Hey, Victor!
There you are!
Come in!
Victor Hugo, I'm J Curby Gremlin.
From Detroit.
It's good to see you.
Is the big boss here yet?
No, not yet.
He's supposed to be here any minute.
Here we go.
Guten Tag. 
It's just the professor.
ZÃ¼ndapp! When is he coming?
He's already here.
Welcome, everyone. 
I wish I could be with you
on this very special day, 
but my clutch assembly broke. 
You know how it is. 
Forget about it.
We know how you feel.
Descramble that voice.
I'm trying.
It's too sophisticated.
We are here to celebrate. 
Today, all your hard work pays off. 
The world turned their backs
on cars like us. 
They stopped manufacturing us,
stopped making our parts. 
The only thing they haven't
stopped doing is laughing at us. 
They've called us terrible names:
jalopy, rust bucket, heap, 
clunker, junker, beater, wreck, rattletrap, 
lemon. 
But their insults just give us strength. 
Because today, my friends,
that all ends! 
There's smoke on the casino bridge! 
Oh, no!
It's Carla Veloso,
the Brazilian race car!
What just happened?
I'm working on it.
They laughed at us,
but now it's our turn to laugh back. 
Another crash!
It's number 9, Nigel Gearsley. 
Embrace your inner lemon. 
Let it drive you. 
I'm detecting an extremely strong
electromagnetic pulse.
Finn, it's the camera.
Where?
On the tower!
This was meant to be alternative fuel's
greatest moment. 
But after today,
everyone will race back to gasoline. 
And we, the owners of the world's
largest untapped oil reserve 
will become the most
powerful cars in the world! 
Get out of the way!
They will come to us,
and they will have no choice, 
because they will need us. 
We figured you might stop by!
And they will finally respect us! 
So hold your hoods high! 
After today, you will never again
be ashamed of who you are! 
No!
Long live lemons! 
Number 7 is loose! Shu Todoroki! 
Finn?
Bumper to bumper
as they approach the finish line! 
McQueen's the winner!
Francesco's second! 
They have no idea
what happened behind them. 
This is impossible!
That's what I'm talking about!
Kachow!
What happened?
Where are all the other cars?
What is going on?
Oh, no!
Sir Axlerod, is the final race in London
still going to take place? 
I suppose that... 
The show must go on, as they say. 
I can't believe this is really happening!
Quiet!
Will you require all the racers
to still run on allinol? 
I cannot, in good conscience,
continue to risk the lives of any more race cars. 
The final race will not
be run on allinol. 
There you have it,
a clearly devastated Sir Miles Axlerod 
announcing that he will not require the cars
to use allinol for the final race. 
A toast!
To the death of allinol
and alternative fuel forever!
Mater, abort the mission.
They've got Finn. Get out of there.
Get out of there right now.
How is your grandfather?
Long live lemons!
Isn't this a great party, Ivan, huh?
Yeah, it's unbelievable.
You are not leaving, are you?
Of course I ain't leaving.
I'm just in shock... 
McQueen?
Crashes are a part of racing, I know, 
but something like that
should never happen. 
You can choose your fuel for the final race.
What it'll be? 
Allinol. 
After today? 
My friend Fillmore says it's safe.
That's good enough for me. 
I didn't standby
a friend of mine recently. 
I'm not gonna make
the same mistake twice. 
So a surprising revelation
from Lightning McQueen. 
He will use allinol in the final race,
despite what occurred today. 
...till Lightning McQueen is dead. 
Of course.
Allinol must be finished for good.
McQueen cannot win the last race.
Lightning McQueen must be killed!
No!
It's the American spy!
Dadgum!
Gatling gun. Request acknowledged. 
Down! Everybody, down!
Shoot! I didn't mean...
Request acknowledged. 
Wait! Wait!
I didn't mean that kind of shoot!
Correction acknowledged.
Deploying chute. 
Whoa!
McQueen!
Whoa! What's this?
Whoa!
McQueen! McQueen!
Let me through! Let me through!
Let me in!
I got to get through to warn McQueen!
You cannota come through here!
Back up.
We have a lunatic at gate 9.
I was disguised as a tow truck
to infiltrate this lemonhead meeting
and my weapons system's done
misinterperated what I'm saying!
Lunatic at gate 9.
McQueen! McQueen!
You are the champion!
This way, signore.
McQueen!
Mater?
McQueen.
Give us a pose!
McQueen!
Stop moving. Stop!
Where you going?
Stop!
McQueen!
That really sounded like...
Mater!
Mater?
Signore? 
McQueen! They're gonna kill you!
Mater!
Excuse me.
No, where are you going?
Scusi. Mater!
McQueen!
Scusi.
Mater! Mater!
Mater, I'm so glad to see you.
Lightning McQueen! I am a huge fan.
I'm sorry, I thought I heard...
That was me. I said, "You killed
out there today. You're the best."
What? I mean, thanks.
Right this way, signore.
I really thought I heard my friend.
In England, you'll be finished!
At the finish line.
Wait, what?
The press is waiting.
Comea with me, please.
Let me go!
You actually care about that race car.
A pity you didn't warn him in time.
"Idiot"? Is that how you see me? 
That's how everyone sees you.
I tell you, that's the genius of it. 
No one realizes they're being fooled 
because they're too busy
laughing at the fool. 
At the fool... 
Excuse me!
Domo arigato! 
Yeah!
You done good.
You got all the leaves.
Check out that tow truck.
I wonder who that guy's with.
Will you guys excuse me
just for one little second?
Now that's a scoop of ice cream!
Somebody get me water! Sweet relief.
Mater!
But I never leak oil. Never.
Get a hold of yourself.
You're making a scene!
Wait a minute.
I didn't screw ya up, did I?
I lost the race because of you!
Maybe if I talk to somebody...
I don't need your help!
I don't want your help.
Your help...
Bang the gong. Get it on!
Listen, this isn't Radiator Springs. 
This is exactly why I don't
bring you along to these things!
Holley! Finn! Where are we?
We're in London, Mater,
inside Big Bentley.
This... This is all my fault.
Don't be a fool, Mater.
But I am, remember? You said so.
When did I...
Mater, I was complimenting you
on what a good spy you are.
I'm not a spy!
I've been trying to tell
you that the whole time.
I really am just a tow truck.
Finn, he's not joking.
I know.
You were right, Finn. I'm a fool.
And what's happened to McQueen
is 'cause I'm such a big one.
This is all my fault.
Good. You're up.
And just in time.
Professor Z wanted you
to have a frontrow seat,
for the death of Lightning McQueen.
He's still alive?
Not for much longer.
We came as soon as you called.
I called to talk to Mater.
It never occurred to me
he wouldn't be there.
Sheriff is talking to Scotland Yard now.
And Sarge is in touch with his friends
in the British military.
You just need to focus on the race.
I know but, Sally with everything
going on, I'm not sure...
Sir Axlerod.
I'm sorry to interrupt.
It's all right.
I just wanted to personally thank you.
Because after Italy, I was finished,
and then you gave me one last shot.
Listen...
I probably shouldn't be saying this,
but I hope you win today.
You show the world that
they've been wrong about allinol.
Mater would want you to race.
All right. For Mater.
Here he comes.
What happened? 
I don't know, Professor.
What did you do?
I didn't do nothing.
I'm talking to the Professor.
What's that, Professor?
You broke it!
Quiet!
I understand, sir. Yes.
What did he say?
We go to the backup plan.
Backup plan?
We snuck a bomb in McQueen's pit.
The next time he makes a stop,
instead of saying "kachow"
he's going to go "kaboom"!
Don't feel bad, tow truck.
You couldn't have saved him.
Wait, you could have!
Dadgum lemons!
Request acknowledged. 
What? You didn't think
we'd take your bullets?
That's right! You got nothing!
Who's the lemon now, huh?
Nice try, Mater.
Dadgum... Dadgum... Dadgum.
Request... Request... Request... 
Mater!
I got to get y'all out of there.
There's no time.
McQueen needs your help.
But I can't. I'm just a tow truck.
It's up to you.
Go to the pits and get everyone out.
You can do that.
What about you guys?
We'll be okay.
Go and get some more dents, Mater.
So, we'll be okay? Really?
He wouldn't have left
if I'd told him the truth.
Being killed by a clock.
Gives a whole new meaning to
"Your time has come."
Time? That's it!
What are you doing?
Trying to turn back time.
If I can just reverse the polarity.
Good job. Quick thinking, Holley.
What's everybody
on the wrong side of the road for?
No!
Drive! Burn rubber!
We've got to get to the course.
Calculate the fastest way to...
Done.
Miss Shiftwell.
They're standard issue now.
You kids get all the good hardware.
No, that's Mater's.
I knew his escape was too easy.
Come back here! Stop!
Mater?
Everybody, get out now!
Y'all get out of the pits.
What are you guys doing here?
We're here because of you, Mater.
Is everything okay?
No, everything's not okay.
There's a bomb in here.
Y'all got to get out. Now.
A bomb?
Mater.
Finn! You're okay.
Listen to me. The bomb is on you!
They knew you'd try to help McQueen.
When we were knocked out,
they planted it in your air filter. 
Mater! There you are!
Stop right there!
I've been so worried about you.
Don't come any closer!
Are you okay?
No, I'm not okay!
Stay away from me!
No, wait! Wait!
A tow truck has just raced
onto the track, driving backwards! 
Mater, wait!
Normally an emergency vehicle on the track
means there's been an accident.
Lightning McQueen is chasing him! 
Mater, wait!
Stay back! If you get close to me,
you're going to get hurt real bad!
I know I made you feel that way before,
but none of that matters!
We're best friends!
And McQueen seems to be having 
a conversation with the tow truck. 
I don't know who that truck is, Brent,
but tell you what, 
he's got to be the world's
best backwards driver. 
McQueen, you don't get it!
I'm the bomb!
Yes, Mater! You are the bomb!
That's what I'm trying to say here!
You've always been the bomb
and you'll always be the bomb.
Stay away!
No! Never!
Almost there.
I'm not letting you get away again!
Got to keep away from McQueen!
Request acknowledged. 
Oh, my gosh.
What is happening? It's a bad dream!
And Lightning McQueen
just blasted away, 
hooked to the now
rocketpropelled tow truck. 
The Professor's on the run!
Someone's got to get McQueen.
Get McQueen!
Holley, I'll get ZÃ¼ndapp. Help Mater.
Got it!
What is happening?
Hurry, Professor.
You really think I'm going
to let you float away, Professor?
McQueen, let go!
Never!
They're coming your way.
Let's go!
Give it up, McMissile.
Mater, stop!
No way! You could get hurt.
Oh, no.
Mater, we've got to get
that bomb off you.
Bomb?
Yeah, they strapped it to me
to kill you as a backup plan.
Backup plan?
Mater, who put a bomb on you?
You! Why didn't my death ray kill you?
Death ray?
Turn off the bomb, ZÃ¼ndapp!
Are you all so dense?
It's voiceactivated.
Everything is voiceactivated these days.
Deactivate! Deactivate!
Voice denied. 
Did I forget to mention
that it can only be disarmed
by the one who activated it?
Say it.
Deactivate.
Voice denied. 
I'm not the one who activated it.
Would anyone else like to try?
You read my mind.
He was getting on my nerves.
What do we do?
It's very simple. You blow up.
I'm going out on a limb here.
These are the guys that want me dead, correct?
It's nothing personal.
Fellers, listen.
I know what you're going through.
Everybody's been laughing at me too.
But becoming powerful and rich
beyond your wildest dreams
ain't gonna make you feel better.
Yeah, but it's worth a shot.
Pit stop.
Not today, boys.
Retreat!
Thanks for the help, Corporal.
Anything for one of Pop's mates.
What's he saying? What's wrong?
None of his wrenches fit the bolts.
I get it. I get it!
I know what needs to be done.
Then do it!
What? No. I can't do it.
Nobody takes me seriously.
I know that now.
This ain't Radiator Springs.
Yes, it is.
Look, you're yourself in Radiator Springs.
Be yourself here.
And if people aren't
taking you seriously,
then they need to change, not you.
I know that because I was wrong before.
Now, you can do this.
You're the bomb.
Thanks, buddy.
No, you're the actual bomb.
Now, let's go!
Right. Hang on!
Where's he going?
Computer!
Yes, Agent Mater? 
I need that thing you done before
to get me away from McQueen!
Request acknowledged. 
Mater?
Now I need you to do the chute!
The second kind, not the first!
Deploying chute. 
Who's winning the race?
Back off! Back away!
It's Lightning McQueen!
No, it's okay!
Tell 'em, Mater. Explain.
Okay.
Somebody's been sabotaging
the racers and hurtin' the cars,
and I know who.
Wait. Your Majesty.
Bomb! It's a bomb!
Everybody, down!
Back up! Move it!
Get off the stage! Move it!
Hold your fire! He can't disarm it!
Mater, I don't know what you're doing,
but stand down now.
This ain't nothing at all
like Radiator Springs.
Mater, just cut to the chase.
Okay. It's him.
What? Me?
You've got to be crazy.
I figured it out when I realized
y'all attached this ticking
time bomb with Whitworth bolts,
the same bolts that hold together
that old British engine
from the photograph.
Holley! Show that picture.
Okay.
I remembered what they say
about old British engines:
if there ain't no oil under 'em,
there ain't no oil in 'em.
What is he talking about?
It was you leaking oil
at the party in Japan.
You just blamed it on me.
Electric cars don't use oil, you twit.
Then you're fakin' it.
You didn't convert to no electric.
If we pop that hood,
we'll see that engine from that picture.
This lorry's crazy!
He's going to kill us all!
Stay away!
But Sir Axlerod created the race.
Why would he want to hurt anyone?
To make allinol look bad so
everybody'd go back to using oil.
He said it himself
with that disguised voice.
Disguised voice? What are you talking about?
You're nuts, you are!
This is going nowhere fast.
We really should go, Grandmother.
One moment,
I'd like to see where this is going.
Mater, he created allinol.
But what if he found
that huge oil field
just as the world was trying
to find something else?
What if he came up with allinol
just to make alternative fuel look bad?
"What if?"
You're basing this on a "what if"?
Okay, that's it.
Lads, clear out.
Wait! Somebody save me!
The lorry's crazy!
Keep away, you idiot!
Mater!
Mater!
Someone do something!
You're insane, you are! Deactivate!
Bomb deactivated.
Have a nice day, Sir Axlerod. 
The engine from the photo.
It's a perfect match.
How did the tow truck figure it out?
It's official. You're coming
to all my races from now on.
Now you're talkin'!
Mater, let's go. You're on.
Your Majesty, may I present
for the investiture of honorary
knighthood of the British Realm,
Tow Mater of Radiator Springs.
Go get 'em, buddy.
I hereby dub thee Sir Tow Mater.
Sir? Shoot, you can just
call me Mater, Your Majesty.
I don't wanna hear none
of this "sir" business.
By the way, have y'all met each other?
Queen, McQueen. McQueen, Queen.
McQueen, McMissile. McMissile, McQueen.
Queen, McMissile.
So there we was,
my rocket jets going full blast,
McQueen hanging on for dear life
when suddenly them two nasty lemons
come out of nowheres, guns drawed.
We was goners.
But then, out of nowhere
this beautiful spy car
swoops in from the sky to save us!
That's a very entertaining story,
young man.
Minny, please. Come on!
None of this happened.
Rocket jets, flying spy cars.
No, you're quite right.
It does sound a bit farfetched.
Holley! What are you doin' here?
Hello, Mater!
It's so good to see you again.
Finn!
Our satellites picked up
an urgent communiquÃ©.
So you gota my email.
Y'all is going to have a great time!
Everybody, this here's Finn McMissile.
He's a secret agent.
Don't tell nobody.
And this is Holley Shiftwell.
She's...
I'm Mater's girlfriend.
It's so nice to meet you all.
Guido believe you now.
Whoa, honey.
You got a nasty dent there.
Yeah.
Was that from when you swooped in
and you saved them in London?
Van!
What? I'm just asking!
Don't you worry. My baby Ramone
can get that fixed up for you in no time.
Yeah, sure thing. No problemo.
Let me go get my tools.
No. I'm keeping that dent.
It's way too valuable.
A valuable dent?
She's as crazy as Mater.
Those two are perfect for each other.
There's one thing I still don't get.
The bad guys hit me with the beam
from the camera, right?
So, why didn't I...
Explode in a fiery inferno?
Yeah.
We couldn't figure that out, either.
Our investigation proved that allinol
was actually gasoline
and Axlerod engineered it so when it
got hit by the beam, it would explode.
Wait a second, Fillmore.
You said my fuel was safe!
If you're implying that I switched
that rotgut excuse for alternative fuel
with my allnatural,
sustainable, organic biofuel
just because I never trusted Axlerod,
you're dead wrong, man!
It was him!
Once big oil, always big oil, man.
Treehugger.
The Radiator Springs Grand Prix
is about to begin.
All spectators, clear the starting line.
I can't wait to get rockin'.
This is gonna be wicked!
We should do this every year.
Yeah, I just figured we never found out
who the world's fastest car is.
Plus, no press, no trophy, just racing.
The way I like it.
Francesco likes it like this, too.
Francesco, I'd like you to meet...
Signorina Sally.
It is official.
Lightning McQueen is
the luckiest car in the world.
Why, thank you.
Which he will have to be to have
a chance against Francesco today!
See you at the finish line, Mc...
What is that?
Just something I had
made up for the occasion.
Isa good, McQueen. Very funny.
Wasa funnier when I did it,
but it'sa very funny.
What are you going to do next?
Are you going to take off your fenders?
Try it. You'll like it.
So, he's not so goodlooking.
Yeah. Nice try.
I'm serious!
That's why I love you, Sally.
Wish me luck!
You don't need it!
That Francesco is finelooking!
And those open wheels.
I'm gonna have to go get
myself some coolant.
Go, Lightning!
Go, Stickers!
Right on, man!
Go get 'em, tiger!
Bravo, bravo!
Go, Lightning, go!
Go, McQueen!
Finn? Time to go.
Siddeley's gassed,
geared and ready to fly.
You're leavin' already?
We've got another mission.
Just stopped by here
to pick something up.
Somethin' tells me you're not talkin'
about souvenir bumper stickers.
Her Majesty asked
for you personally, Mater.
But I told y'all before, I'm not a spy.
We know.
Spy or not, you're still the smartest,
most honest chap we've ever met.
Don't forget massively charming.
Well, thanks.
But as much fun as it was
hangin' with y'all, this...
This is home.
That's all right. We understand.
But I'll be back.
You still owe me that first date.
If there's ever anything I can do for you,
just let me know.
Well, I sure appreciate that.
Thank you.
Actually, there is one thing.
I'll be doggone!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Thanks, Mater!
Impossible!
Mater!
Check it out.
They let me keep the rockets.
I'll see you at the finish line, buddy!
Not if I see you first!
Yippee!
