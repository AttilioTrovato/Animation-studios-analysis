This could be
the room of any small boy.
But, in fact, it's not.
It is the room of one young boy
in particular named Christopher Robin.
Now, Christopher Robin
has a very active imagination,
not to mention the uncanny ability
to collect things.
Big things. Small things. Sticky things.
But his favourite things
are his stuffed animals.
Ah! There they are now.
A charming and eccentric
cast of characters.
And his best friend among them
is a bear named Winnie the Pooh.
Or Pooh for short.
Together they had many
unusual adventures,
that all happened right here
in the Hundred Acre Wood.

Chapter one,
in which Winnie the Pooh
has a very important thing to do.
As the sun rose over
the Hundred Acre Wood,
Pooh leapt out of bed and greeted
the day with much enthusiasm.
Ooh...
Honey.
Uh, Pooh?
More honey, please.
I say, Pooh?
Pooh?
Oh, do wake up.
Pooh!
Oh!
Oh, bother. I was having
the most wonderful dream.
Yes, but it's time to wake up.
You have a very important thing
to do today.
Like what?
Well, if I told you that,
I'd ruin the rest of the story,
wouldn't I?
Of course.
What could be more important
than a little something to eat?
Or perhaps a little larger something.
Oh, not to worry, tummy.
I always know what to do.

Bother.
I know that sigh.
Good morning, Eeyore.
Lovely day, isn't it?
Wish I could say yes, but I can't.
Oh my, Eeyore.
You wouldn't happen to have any honey
lying about, would you?
You see, I seem to have run out.
Oh, yes. Good idea, tummy.
Perhaps I should look in back.
Bother. No honey in here, either.
What?
Eeyore, what has happened to your tail?
What has happened to it?
Well...
...it isn't there.
That accounts for a good deal.
That explains everything.
No wonder.
Oh! There it is.
I'd recognize it anywhere.
The very tree where I was hatched.
I remember the day
Mother made these marks,
her giant meaty claw carving furrows
in the crumbly bark.
Chapter one, the birth of a genius.
Pardon me, Owl. What are you doing?
Hmm? Oh, hello, Pooh. Eeyore.
Why, I'm penning my personal memoirs.
Yes. Now, where was I?
Oh, yes, of course. With steely nerve...
Perhaps you could take a short break
from your important work
and help us find Eeyore's tail?
...and I rocketed towards Eeyore's tail!
Eeyore's tail?
What's wrong with Eeyore's tail?
Well, it isn't there.
Yes. So I see.
Won't you help us, Owl?
You have such a talent for speaking
and telling us what to do.
Oh, thank you, Pooh. Yes, I do, don't I?
I didn't think anyone noticed.
All right, take this.
Write this down carefully.
Now, the customary procedure
in such cases is as follows.
Excuse me, Owl,
but what does
"Crustimoney Proseedcake" mean?
For I am a bear of very little brain
and long words bother me.
It means "the thing to do."
Oh. Well, as long as it means that,
I don't mind.
All right. Yes, well,
the thing to do is as follows:
First, issue a reward to the...
Gesundheit.
I beg your pardon?
Well, you sneezed
just as you were going to tell me
what the first thing to do was.
I didn't sneeze.
No, you did, Owl.
No, I didn't. You can't sneeze
without knowing it.
Well, you can't know it without
something having been sneezed.
As I was saying,
first, issue a reward.
He's doing it again.
You must be catching a cold.
I'll probably catch it, too.
No, no, no! I'm not catching a cold.
The word is "issue," not "achoo",
and "achoo" isn't even a word.
It's just a sort of sneezy sound
like achoo!
Perhaps you should lie down, Owl?
Oh!
My throat feels a little scratchy.
Open wide, please.
Ahh.
Just as I suspected.
Owl, we need honey.
Enough of this infernal folderol!
Look, the thing to do is,
we write a notice
promising a large something
to anyone who finds
a replacement tail for Eeyore!
Is that clear?
That sounds like a wonderful plan, Owl.
Excellent. Now, we shall get Christopher
Robin to write out the notices,
and we'll put them up
all over the forest.
Here you are, Pooh.
Oh, and make sure everyone can see them.
Oh, I will, Christopher.

And now, I shall return to...
Oh!
Hello, B'loon.
We have a very important
thing to do today.
Oh, yes.
Perhaps you'd like to join us?
Poor Eeyore. He's lost his tail.
Consider yourself pounced.
That was a close call there, Pooh Bear.
This guy... and I'm talking to you...
...he was sneaking up on ya.
Whoo! Oh!
A slippery little devil, eh?
Get back here!
Oh, no, you don't. Come here. Whoo!
Well, I must have scared him off.
Um... Tigger?
Yes, my good man?
Why, you.
Here, take some of that! What is this?
Oh, really? Sticking to me now.
This isn't working out the way
I was hoping. Make him go away.
Oh, dear.
Get him off of me!
Is he still there?
Oh, yes. He's still here.
And I think he wants to stick with you.
What?
I never thought of having
a sidekick before.
I got to admit, he is a handsome devil.
Look at the chin on this kid.
No, no. I can't do it, I tell you.
It's too risky.
Why, if something were to happen
to this little guy,
I just couldn't live with myself.
It's a dangerous path I bounce.
But I bounce it alone.
Because the Hundred Acre Wood
needs a hero, Pooh Bear,
and I'm the only one.

Hoohoohoohoo!
Attention, please. Attention.
Something tragic has befallen
a member of our community.
I present to you: Exhibit A.
Oh! That is tragic.
What? Oh, no, no, no.
Eeyore, will you turn around, please?
Oops, sorry.
Our dear friend Eeyore
has lost his tail.
Oh, dear.
We mustn't leave him in this condition.
So, we will have a contest
to find a new tail for Eeyore.
I do say, Christopher
Robin, the winners of such contest
are traditionally awarded
some form of remuneration.
What is a "remooner"...
Moonyour... A renew...
What are we renumbering?
I don't know, Pooh,
but it sounds like a good thing.
Oh, yes, it is a good thing, Piglet.
It's a prize. But what shall it be?
How about something great,
like a firecracker!
Oh, gracious, no.
How about something nice,
like a warm hug?
Pruning shears. I need pruning shears.
I'd say thistles,
but nobody listens to me, anyway.
Oh, Christopher Robin, I was hoping
for something a bit... sweeter?
Why, Pooh, that's a grand idea.
The prize for a new tail shall be...
a pot of honey.
Hooray!
As the others
searched for a tail,
Pooh realized that a pine cone
would not win him the honey.
Why not?
Because it would have to be
something special.
Oh. Special, you say. Special.
Think, think, think.
No hurry, Pooh. Just take your time.
Take my time. What a wonderful idea.
Cuckoo, cuckoo.
Thanks, Pooh.
Congratulations.
You've won the contest.

Oh, bother.
My tummy is feeling
a little 11 o'clockish.
Do you still tell the time,
clock friend?
I can't tell by the expression
on your face.
Pooh left feeling unsatisfied
and a little out of sorts.
In fact, he was so distracted
by his rumbly tummy,
that he didn't notice that he was
walking onto the next paragraph.
What is a paragraph?
It's a group of sentences
that form a complete thought.
Is there honey in this paragraph?
Oh, sorry, Pooh, no.
Well, then I don't find it very useful.
What's that, Pooh?
I'm not sure. I shall follow it
to see where it leads.
Eeyore, your tail!
Yep. Unravelled.
Guess I'm back where I started.
I'm sorry, Eeyore.
Such a nice tail, too.
No matter.
All good things come to an end.
Oh. Oh! Eeyore, if you...
Oh, my goodness.
This story is going too fast!
I wish that paragraph
had been a little longer.
Ooh! Of course.
Christopher Robin will have some honey.
He loves to share. Especially with me.
Christopher Robin!
Are you not there?
Oh.
Just then,
Pooh spotted a note.
I did?
Certainly.
Just there, at your feet.
Oh...
Uh, to your left.
Uh, no, Pooh, your other left.
A little bit more.
A tad. A hair. No, no, back a bit.
Oh!
There you are.
Well, it's a good thing I noticed it.
Otherwise, I wouldn't have seen it.
Pooh was puzzled by the note.
Even more so than usual.
And even more than that.
So, Pooh decided to go directly
to Owl's house,
hoping that Owl could help unpuzzle him.
♪ You get the honey
Enjoy ♪
Good job, Owl!
Thank you. Thank you.
Yes, it is quite clever, isn't it?
TAEL. Yes. Perfect.
Well, hello there, Owl.
That is a very fine looking pot of honey
you've got there.
And so remarkably... gooey.
Gooey? That happens to be
my personal favourite.
Ooh! What do you have there, my boy?
Oh. A note I found
at Christopher Robin's.
With strange words I cannot read.
But, Pooh, you can't read most words.
Yes, but especially not
the strange ones.
Let me see. There's never been a note
written that I could not decipher.
Here, Pooh, help yourself.
Yes, parchment is of a fine quality.
Oh, stuff and fluff.
Don't leave us in suspense, Owl.
What does it say?
Patience! Patience.
One must be careful when decoding
such arcane text
so as not to incorrectly interpret
its true meaning.
So, can you read it?
Of course I can! It says...
"Gone out. Busy. Backson.
Signed, Christopher Robin."
Our dear friend
Christopher Robin has been captured!
What?
By a creature called "The Backson."
Backson!
Captured by the Backson!
What's a Backson?
Ooh!
A horrible creature! Malicious!
You don't say.
Ferocious!
Fero... ?! Ooh!
And worst of all, terribly busy.
So, what does this Backson look like?
I saw a picture of one
just the other day.
Oh, Christopher Robin.
Now, let me see.
Bathwater, biscuit, baby,
barnacle, beluga...
Wait a minute, why is biscuit
ahead of baby and barnacle?
That doesn't make sense.
Oh, it's such a mess in here.
Dash it all! Where is that picture?
I have some chalk, Owl. Can you draw it?
What an excellent idea, young man.
Artistic talent runs through my family.
In fact, it practically stampedes!

While Rabbit and the others
were busy gathering
the Backson's favourite things,
Pooh and Piglet found the perfect place
to dig the pit.
Piglet dug, and dug, and dug.
And Pooh supervised.
And now to disguise the pit.
Catch, Piglet.
Gosh, Pooh, I hope this idea works.
Oh, it will, Piglet.
The Backson shall follow the trail
of items right to this lovely picnic.
Which is
just the pit, of course.
And when he falls in,
we'll get Christopher Robin back.
Yes, Piglet. We shall get
Christopher Robin back.
Very exciting.
What do you think, Pooh?
Hmm. I think this rock
would be better over there.
Here?
Oh, yes. That makes
all the difference, you see.
Oh! I almost forgot
the most important part.
Oh, yes, Piglet. I couldn't agree more.
Hmm?
Oh, Piglet, this is a very light lunch.
No, Pooh. This isn't lunch.
I just thought it would
complete the disguise.
Well, it certainly fooled me.
Well done, you two.
Now, put your combat gear on.
This is a dangerous mission,
and we cannot afford any mistakes.
The fate of Christopher Robin
is in our hands.
Ah!
As the group continued on
with Rabbit's plan,
they journeyed deeper
and deeper into the woods,
placing items as they...
Hey, hey!
You want to keep it down up there, pal?
What? Tigger?
Why aren't you with the others?
Because. I'm busy tracking the Backson.
Shhshhshh.
Yes, but what about Rabbit's plan?
Only a Tigger can catch a Backson.
And I'm the only Tigger, see.
Hello.
Hoo!
I probably deserved that.
Oops! Look who it is! Hoohoo!
Let me get off your back.
There we go.
I thought you were the Backson!
Until I found out you wasn't.
What are you doing out here, anyways?
Too slow. Got left behind.
Left behind?
That's a horrendemous thing
to do to a guy.
No matter.
Sure would like to help

but I can't.
Hmm.

Thanks, but I...

Where did you go, you little bouncer?
Ooh. Going bareknuckled.
Look at this guy. I like your style!
Now this is just ridicerous!
You are gonna need this
if you're gonna get the Backson!
Ohoh!
Backson tracks!
The Backson must have got Tigger Two!
He's picking us off. One by one.
Gosh, Pooh, I hope the Backson
is pleased with all of our items.
I'm sure he will be. Oh.
I wish I had some honey.
Piglet, um, could you come here, please?
Pooh, are you sure
this is going to work?
Well, of course, Piglet.
Once I get you up in the tree,
just hand me the beehive.
And then tummy and I will
take care of the rest, won't we?
OK, Pooh.
I guess you've thought this through.
Oh, yes, Piglet. Indeed I have.
Oh, bother. I don't remember
thinking that through.
Um, I'm sorry
I messed up the plan, Pooh.
Oh, don't worry, Piglet.
I shall get you out,
and we'll try again.
It's no use.
Think, think, think.
Ah! I know.
I'll have you down
in just a moment, Piglet.
No hurry, Pooh.
The bees are quite gentle.
As long as there's no sudden movement.
Ah! Oh, my!
Pooh, are you sure that's a good idea?
Oh, yes, Piglet.
Ah!
I'm quite sure.
Well, you know best, Pooh.
Ah! Oh.
Oh. There we are.
Oops. New plan, Piglet. Run!
OK.
Oh... Is this fast enough, Pooh?
I suppose you could run a little faster.
Whoa!
Ooh!
And this can go here. All done.
It takes a smart rabbit
to trap a Back...
Oh! What are you two doing?
Beehives are not on my list
of Backsonfriendly items!
But, Rabbit, the...
Move along, move along.
Well, I was moving.
Oh, that Backson is sure
to pick up this trail,
and we don't want to be around
when he does.
Come, come! Go, go, go!
Rabbit, please, can we stop for lunch?
Pooh, we cannot rest until
Christopher Robin is rescued.
Try thinking of him instead of honey.
Very well. Christopher Robin.
Christopher Robin. Christopher Robin!
Ooh. It worked. Much better.
Does anybody see that?
See what, honey?
Honey? Ooh!
I can't wait to see the honey
on that Backson's honey
when he falls into our honey. Eh, Owl?
That cheeky honey will honey twice
before honeying our honey again.
After we honey the honey,
can I honey a honey?
Uhuhuh.
No honey before honey, honey.
Wha... ?
Honey up, Pooh. We have to honey.
Honey.
Ooh, honey!
Yes.
Honey.

the honey honey away,

get him out of there?
♪ It's me, it's me
♪ I win the honey pot
♪ Found this anchor over there
♪ Now it's on my derrière
♪ Not that anybody'd care ♪
OK, everyone,
make sure you have a good hold.
Heaveho! Heaveho!
Something tells me I was better off
with Tigger.
Heaveho!
Yep.
Oh, this is lovely.
We are stuck down here,
and the Backson is still up there.
Oh, dear! Wait for me.
No, Piglet! No, no, Piglet. Stay.
But the Backson!
You can help us if you stay up there!
OK, Piglet, go look for something
to get us out of here.
OK.
There might be
something over by the pack.
Thank goodness one of us is up there.
I was worried we'd be
stuck here forever.
I found something. Here.
What?
Ooh.
That's a lovely flower, Piglet.
Yeah, I thought so, too.
Yes, Piglet,
it's very nice, a perennial.
But I think we need something longer.
Longer? Of course. How silly of me.
Oh, good thought, Piglet.
But you can't possibly think
that that's long enough.
Oh, yes, it is.
Owl read this to me once,
and it was certainly the longest thing
I'd ever heard.
Oh.
It's true, Rabbit.
It lags a bit in the middle.
Of all things, why didn't we think
to bring a rope?
Well, there is this rope.
Spoton, Piglet. Do be a helpful
little swine and get us out of here.
All of you?
Yes, Piglet, all of us.
All right. Three, four...
Don't forget Rabbit.
And six.
There! Now you can all get out!
How very thoughtful you are, Piglet.
Good grief! Tie them together, Piglet.
Can you tie a knot?
I cannot.
So, you can knot.
No, I cannot knot.
Not knot?
Who's there?
Pooh!
Pooh who?
No! Pooh, it's...
Piglet, you'll need more than two knots.
Not possible.
Ah! So, it is possible
to knot those pieces.
Not these pieces.
Yes, knot those pieces.
Why not?
Because it's all for naught.
Oh, dear! I can't tie a knot.
But there is something I can do.
Don't worry, Rabbit.
Piglet's very clever.
I can tie a bow.
See?
For crying out loud! Piglet!
I know! Christopher Robin
has a jump rope.
Ahh!
Wait a minute. My gracious, that's it!
Piglet, go to Christopher Robin's house.
Oh, I see.
Yes, Piglet, go, and bring some honey.
Yes, bring some honey...
The jump rope,
Piglet, the jump rope.
With a little honey on the side.
You mean, all by myself?
Through there?
Yes, Piglet.
Through a dark wood fraught with peril,
on a mission of life or death.
It is a task of great complexity,
but I have full confidence
that you shall return victorious,
and rescue us from the abyss.
Go forth, Piglet,
and we shall await your return.
For weeks, if necessary.
Owl!
What?
I can't believe how wonderful
that speech was.
I can't, either.
Moved me to tears.
So Piglet bravely ventured
forth towards Christopher Robin's house.
But the further he went,
the more frightened he became.
Oh, dear.
I mustn't fear.
There's a very important thing to...
Do...
Oh. It's just you, B'loon.
I'll get some help.
Oh, dear. I am the help.
How did you ever get stuck up there?
It wasn't the Backson, was it?
Oh, good.
I knew the Backson wasn't around here.
Backson!
Huh?! Backson?
Piglet, help!
Whew.
Let me tell you, that was the last time
I'll ever put my beak
in a keyhole.
Shhshhshh!
Do you hear something?
Help! Help me!
Piglet!
He knows my name!
Yeah!
Whoa! Oh!
Ah!
Backson!
Whew! It's only Tigger.
Oh! Hi, fellas!
Tigger Two?
I thought the Backson got you.
Ahh. As soon as we get out of here,
we're gonna show that Backson
what Tiggers are made of, aren't we?
Thanks, but I'd rather stay an Eeyore.
What? But what about all the pouncing
and the trouncing?
And the mixing it up?
I thought you liked being a Tigger.
The most wonderful thing about Tiggers,
is you're the only one.
Aw, shucks. I'm speechless.
Excuse me.
I can't breathe!
Oh.
Sorry about that, little guy.
I didn't mean to scare you.
Wait! B'loon! Don't leave!
You're the only one
who can get us out of here!
We're all gonna die.
Cheer up, Eeyore.
We won't perish for days.
Which leaves plenty of time for me
to continue my memoirs.
Now, dear Uncle Ridley...
♪ Honey ♪
...exacerbated
by my aunt's predilection
for only the finest parchment...
Hmm.
...woven so tightly
the ink took weeks to fully dry.
Their nest was littered with quills
that were never used,
papers that were never cut,
and letters that never dried.
My aunt often bemoaned the situation in
letters that she couldn't write to me.
It drove my poor uncle absolutely batty,
which is quite a feat for an owl,
I assure you.
Now, when my uncle had committed
an exceedingly rousing point...
Empty.
...and let me tell you,
it packed quite a wallop.
Huh?
Look! Look, the letters!
The ladder! The ladders formed a letter!
I mean the letters... We can get out!
And so they all used the
letter ladder to climb out of the pit.
But little did they know that
coming through the bushes was...
Backson!
Back to the pit!
Wait, everyone.
It's only me.
Christopher Robin!
You found them, B'loon. Well done.
It's Christopher Robin!
How did you escape from the Backson?
Backson? What on earth is a Backson?
He wakes up babies!
He swipes your stripes!
He puts out the lights!
Yes, and we thought he took you from us.
What gave you the idea
I was taken by a Backson?
Your note.
Christopher Robin explained
that it had all been a misunderstanding.
And now that it was autumn,
the school year had begun.
His note was simply to say he had
gone out and would be back soon.
Oh!
Ooh. Um...
OK.
It's getting late.
We ought to be heading back.
Just a moment, everyone.
Just a moment, everyone.
Oh, yes. You're right, Piglet.
We owe a very special someone...
...a token of our appreciation.
Ohh!
This reward goes to a good friend
and a loyal companion.
Someone who not only helped us
out of this pit,
but also found Christopher Robin.
And he just so happens
to be wearing red today.
So it is with great, great honour
and a humble heart,
that I bestow this pot of honey
upon our dear friend...
...B'loon.
Wonderful idea, Rabbit.
Hooray!
Hooray, B'loon!
Thank you, B'loon. Goodbye.
Hooray!
Pooh watched as B'loon took
the honey pot higher and higher,
until it was completely out of sight.
Oh, bother.
Sorry, Pooh.
Ever have one of those days
where you just can't win, Eeyore?
Yep. I know how you feel.
Oh, yes.
I simply must find some honey.
As Pooh continued searching,
he got hungrier...
Oh!
...and hungrier...
Yes, tummy, I know.
...and hungrier...
Ohh...
...until he found himself
at Owl's house.
Well, stone the crows.
If it isn't Pooh Bear.
Hello, Owl.
Well, congratulate me.
For what?
I have achieved completion
of my autobiographical treatise!
Oh! Was it painful?
No, no, no. My memoirs are finished.
Oh.
Dash it all, Pooh. Why do you keep
staring at that bell rope?
Because it reminds me of something.
And that reminds me
of another something.
Perhaps I could borrow some honey?
Just a taste? A drop, perhaps?
A small lick, I should think.
My boy, I shall do better than that.
Not only will I beckon you to my table,
but as we feast,
I shall treat you to an excerpt
from chapter 127,
which tells the gripping tale of how
only a few days ago,
I found that very handsome bell rope
that you were admiring
just hanging over a thistle bush.
Thistle bush?
Or was it a gorse bush?
No. No. It was definitely
a thistle bush.
Pardon me, Owl.
At first I thought someone lived there,
so I rang it.
No one answered.
And then the thing just fell off
in my hand.
What sort of place
was this particular thistle bush in?
Certainly not a very cheery place.
One might say it was rather...
Gloomy?
Yes. That's it. Do you know it?
Oh, dear.
Nobody seemed to want it,
so I brought it home.
Oh, but somebody did want it, Owl.
Really? Who?
Eeyore. My dear friend Eeyore.
He was fond of it, you see.
Fond of it?
Attached to it.
Attached?
Ohh!
Yes. Well, yes.
And I was just keeping it safe for him.
Well, there you are.
And you can tell him he's welcome.
Yes, Owl. And thank you very much.
I say, Pooh! What about the honey?
Some other time, perhaps?
Ignoring his tummy's
desperate pleas,
Pooh went directly
to Christopher Robin's.
Tail.
Nail.
Hammer.
So what do you think, Eeyore?
I'll test it out.
Seems about the right length.
Pink bow's a nice touch.
Swishes real good, too.
So, are you happy, Eeyore?
No.
Ooh.
But I sure do like this new tail.
Thank you, Pooh.
And now,
I have a surprise for you, Pooh.
I do like surprises.
OK. Open your eyes.
They're open, Christopher.
No, silly.
Put your arms down.
Congratulations, Pooh.
You win the grand prize!

You know, Pooh, you did
a very important thing today.
I did?
Well, yes.
Instead of thinking of your tummy,
you thought of your friend.
Oh, thank you, Christopher Robin.
And now I don't think
I shall be hungry again
for a good long while.
Oh, bother.
Silly old bear.
Oh! Ooh, ooh, ooh!
Wow! It's amazing
what you can find in the woods.
A marble! And a boot!
And oh, my,
that's a scarylookin' fella.
Gosh! Maybe these are his things.
You know, I better pick 'em up
so they won't get broken.
That's the last thing I would want.
Whoa!
Oh, my gosh!
Is this a pit? I think I'm in a pit!
Hello? Anybody up there?
Oh, well. I sure hope that fella
will be back soon.
