Now, where to begin?
How 'bout, "Once upon a time"?
How many times have you
heard that to begin a story?
Let's do somethin' else.
I got it, I got it, here we go.
Here's how to open a movie!
No, I don't think so.
It sounds familiar. Doesn't it, to you?
Oh, no, no, not the book.
How many have seen
"opening the book" before?
Close the book.
We're not doing that.
Here's what we're gonna do.
Why don't I just
go back to the day
things took a turn for the worse?
Run for your lives!
Everyone run for cover!
SOS! Mayday! Mayday!
Code red! Duck and cover!
You're all in danger!
Run for cover!
Run for your lives!
Emergency! Emergency!
Run for your lives!
Look out! Take cover!
Run for cover!
Chicken Little!
What is it? What's going on?
The sky is falling!
The sky is falling!
The sky is falling?
Are you crazy?
No, no, no!
It's true! Come with me!
No. Son? What?
It happened under the old oak tree!
I'm not making this up.
I know it's here.
There's a piece
of the sky somewhere...
...somewhere
on the ground here.
It was shaped like that!
It looks like a stop sign?
Yes!
Only it doesn't say "stop"
and it's blue and it has a cloud on it.
And it hit me on the head!
It looked like a stop sign.
Wait! What's that?
Son, is this what hit you?
What?
No, Dad. It was definitely
a piece of the sky!
Piece of the sky.
It's OK, everyone!
Dad, no.
There's been, like, a little mistake.
It was just an acorn that hit my son.
A little acorn.
No! Dad, no.
Quiet, son.
This is embarrassing enough already.
Chicken Little!
What were you thinkin'?
Why put your town's safety
in jeopardy?
How could you mistake
a stop sign for an acorn?
But it... a big acorn level fluh.
What did he say?
A big acorn level fluh...
It was a big acorn?
It was an ape throwing coleslaw?
A big acorn level fluh...
Gesundheit!
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's just gibberish,
gibberish of an insane person.
Come on, Buck!
Your kid went and
scared us all half to death!
Well, what can I tell you, folks,
my son,
you know... Kids do crazy stuff.
You have kids. It's...
No, Dad. It wasn't an acorn.
It was... it was a piece of the sky.
Really, it was.
You gotta believe me.
A movie. A movie.
They're makin' a movie.
When? When will everybody
forget your big mistake?
First it was all over the papers,
then they wrote a book about it,
then the book on tape,
then the board game,
the spoons with your face on it...
And then the Web site,
the commemorative plates.
You saw them, right?
I saw them.
Can't eat off 'em.
They're not microwavesafe.
You saw the billboards?
I saw them.
There's a bumper sticker.
I knew it was only a matter of time.
Billboards I could live with.
Posters I could even live with.
But a bumper sticker.
It's... it's like glued on forever.
It doesn't matter. You know why?
Because I've got a plan.
Yeah, about that.
Well, remember how I told you
it would be better
for you to lay low,
don't call attention to yourself?
Yes, but I...
See, it's like a game.
Yeah, a game of hideandseek, except
the goal is never to be found, ever!
Great! Now,
we've got a plan, right?
I'll see ya later!
Remember, lay low.
Yeah. OK.
Bye.
Look, Mama!
There's the crazy chicken!
Yes, it is! Crazy chicken. You're so
smart. We don't make eye contact. Bye!
That's it. Today is a new day.
It was a recipe for disaster
A fourcourse meal of "No sirree"
It seemed that happily ever after
Was happy everyone was after me
It was a cup of good intentions
A tablespoon of one big mess
A dash of overreaction
And I assume you know the rest
One little slip
One little slip
It was a fusion of confusion
With a few confounding things
I guess I probably took
the wrong direction
Well I admit I might've
missed a sign or two
I took a right turn at confusion
A left when I should've gone
straight on through
I ran ahead with my assumptions
And we all know
what that can do
One little slip
It was a fusion of confusion
And a few confounding things
I get the feeling in this town
I'll never live 'til I live down
The one mistake that seems
to follow me around
But they'll forget about the sky
When they all realize
This guy's about to try
to learn to fly
Or hit the ground
How's it going?
It was a cup of good intentions
A tablespoon of one big mess
A dash of overreaction
And I assume you know the rest
One little slip
One little slip
It was a humble little stumble
With a big ungraceful
One little slip
It was a fusion of confusion
with a few confounding things
Very well. Foxy Loxy.
Present, pretty and punctual.
Goosey Loosey.
Master Runt of the Litter.
Present and accounted for,
Mr. Woolensworth.
Dropped my pencil!
Loser!
Henny Penny.
Here.
Ducky Lucky.
Here.
Fuzzy Wuzzy.
Here.
Morkubine Porcupine.
Yo.
Fish Out of Water.
Quite. Abby Mallard.
Ugly duckling.
Class! I will not tolerate rude behavior
at the expense of a fellow...
Hey, no worries, Mr. Woolensworth.
You mustn't sneak up on me, Ugly...
Abby.
Where was I?
Ugly duckling.
Oh, yes.
Chicken Little.
Tardy again.
Tardy again.
Class, turn to page 62
and translate each word in Mutton.
He.
She.
They.
We.
OK, everyone. Listen up!
I don't wanna hear any quacks,
tweets, oinks, whinnies
or cockleedoodledoos
when I say... dodgeball.
Oh, man.
Pump it up!
Pump it, pump it, pump it!
Split into two teams.
Popular versus unpopular.
Coach?
Yeah, unpopular?
Shouldn't we review safety guidelines?
Sure! Hit the pig, kids!
Look out!
Calm down, Runt. Just...
Just do what Fish is doing.
Everybody dance now
Tough morning?
A runin with my old nemesis.
Gum in the crosswalk?
He won.
Your old foe!
Incoming on your right.
Thank you.
Yeah, I heard about the movie.
Tough break.
Yeah.
Maybe it'll just go straight to video.
That's the least of my problems.
This morning... this morning my dad
told me I should basically disappear.
But that's not gonna get me down.
I've got a plan.
You want to hear about it?
No, no, no! This one's good.
Look, one moment destroyed my life,
right? One moment.
Warthog at 3:00!
I see him!
Yes!
So I figure all I need is a chance...
All I need is a chance
to do something great
to make everyone forget the
"sky falling" thing once and for all.
Then my dad'll finally
have a reason to be proud of me.
Time out!
Nurse!
Hi, Tiffany!
Hey, man, what's goin' on?
So, what do you think?
OK, listen.
You said the sky was falling.
Your dad didn't support you.
I...
And you have been
hurting inside ever since, right?
It's hurt. It stung. OK?
It's hurt, but... Yes.
That's the nutshell.
Yes, but...
No..
But, it's...
What's got to happen now is
the nut needs to be cracked open.
And not one little chip
at a time, but... bam!
Smash! Bits of emotion flying
everywhere! Anger! Frustration!
Denial! Fear! Deep depression, in fact!
You see what I'm saying?
All right, forget the nut part.
Here's the main thing.
You have got to stop messing around,
and deal with the problem.
But...
Here's the real solution.
You and your dad
talktalktalking... closure!
Closure?
Closure,
talking about something
until it's resolved.
Wait! Hold on! See? Look.
There's a whole section about it
in this month's Modern Mallard.
Incredibly appropriate!
I told you, I have a plan.
Yeah, but according to Cosmo Duck,
you should
"stop the squawk and try the talk. "
Beautiful Duckling says,
"Avoiding closure with your
parents can cause early molting. "
See? Closure.
Come on, repeat after me.
You, your dad, talktalk...
Abby, Abby, Abby, listen!
Talking's a waste of time.
I got to do something great
so my dad doesn't think I'm a loser.
Come on. You are not a loser.
You're inventive and resourceful
and funny and cute and...
What?
Yeah... Runt!
Should Chicken Little have a good talk
with his dad and clear the air
or keep searching for BandAid solutions
and never deal with the problem?
BandAid solutions!
Runt!
Well, I'm sorry!
I'm very bad at reading facial cues.
Fish, help me out here.
Men.
'Twas beauty that killed the beast.
I guess only girls are good at honest
communication and sensitivity.
That does it!
We were in a timeout, Foxy!
Prepare to hurt. And I don't
mean emotionally, like I do.
We will save you!
Fall back! Mad goose!
Chicken Little!
Not showing up for class,
inappropriate school attire,
picking fights in gym class
and the fire alarm?
Ever since that "sky falling" incident,
he's been nothing but trouble!
Now look, Buck.
You know I have
the utmost respect for you.
I mean, you were Buck "Ace" Cluck,
our school baseball star.
But let's face the facts.
Your kid, he's nothing like you at all.
OK.
Thank you for talking to me.
I'll take care of my son.
I... Dad, it wasn't my fault.
It was Foxy. She's always...
All right. It's fine.
You don't have to explain anything.
Hey, Dad?
I was thinkin'.
Yeah, what if I...?
What if...?
What if I joined the baseball team?
Hey, why don't you
watch where you're going?!
Sorry, there, buddy! Sorry, sorry.
Baseball? Son, we talked about this.
Yeah, right. But, you know,
that was when I was small.
I put on five ounces this year.
I've really bulked up.
Really, son?
Baseball. Are you sure?
Oh, yeah, yeah. I mean,
you know, hey, why not, right?
Yeah, why not, but why?
Well, Dad,
you were such a big
baseball star in high school.
You could give me some pointers.
But son, I'm just wondering...
Maybe baseball isn't exactly
your thing, you know?
Have you considered the chess team
or the glee club?
And some teenagers, you know, they
get quite a rush from stamp collecting.
No.
Wanna stop? We'll get stamps.
I don't like stamps.
Colors, colorful things...
No, I was thinkin' baseball!
I can't wait to see
the look on your face
when I smack that ball in
for a touchdown!
Dad... I'm kidding.
That was a... that was a joke.
Just do me one favor, son.
Why, sure, Dad. Anything.
Just please try not
to get your hopes too high.
Yeah, but Dad, I mean, I...
I mean, I think I can...
OK, Dad.
I bruise you
You bruise me
We both bruise so
Easily
Too easily
To let it show
I love you
And that's all I know
Oh, Chloe. If only you were here.
You'd know what to do.
And all my plans
Keep fallin' through
All my plans, they
Depend on you
Depend on you
To help them grow
I love you
That's my boy!
Gee, thanks, Dad!
And that's all
It's really all I know
It's all I know
Come on. All I need is a chance.
It's all
I know
Yeah
Ohh
I can't sit here
while I go nowhere
Chase my dreams
through the polluted air
I'm walking on a wire
Running out of time
There's no room
in this ol' heart of mine
Hungry minds
just stare you in the eyes
Spread it thick
and lay the biggest lies
Words jump off the pages
Passion hits the street
Anger's cooking
in the city heat
World's too crazy
I can't take no more
I won't stay here
locked behind the door
Got to stir it up
I got to break it up now
When I think about tomorrow
Ooh, I can't wait to
Stir it up
Got to shake it up now
If I have to beg or borrow
I'm not gonna take it anymore
Ohoh ohohhoh ohohhoh
Come on
So much pressure
to keep holding on
Whoa
Pack my clothes up baby
I'll be gone
Stir it up
Got to break it up now
When I think about tomorrow
I can't wait to
Stir it up
I got to shake it up now
If I have to beg or borrow
I'm not gonna take it no more
Lean to the left
Lean to the right
C'mon Acorns
Fight, fight, fight! Go, Acorns!
There's excitement
in the air, ladies and gentlemen.
It's been two decades since
Oakey Oaks has beaten rivals
the Spud valley Taters.
Down by only a single run,
with a player in scoring position,
we finally have a chance again.
This excitement isn't about
the fun of baseball, the prize.
It's about the gloating
and rubbing their noses in it,
the "Nahnahnanana!
We beat you!" taunting
that comes with the winning.
Yeah!
That's right. Oakey Oaks
and Mayor Turkey Lurkey
will finally have bragging rights
again for one full year!
Hey.
Whoa!
This battle has taken a heavy toll
on our hometown heroes.
After nine grueling innings
and several players out with injuries,
the Acorns are scraping
the bottom of the roster.
Hopefully, there's just enough muscle
on the bench to pull out a win.
Up next... Chicken Little.
Clearly a long shot, folks.
Little hasn't been up to bat once
since joining the team.
He's gonna lose the game for us!
But wait!
If he can just get a walk
and advance to first, that powerhouse,
Foxy Loxy can step up
and save us all.
She's had a terrific game so far.
A shooin for the MvP trophy.
OK, kid, listen up.
You have an ittybitty,
teenytiny strike zone.
There's no way he can throw you out!
Take the walk. Don't swing.
I have a good feeling...
Look at me. Don't swing.
Take the walk. You hear me?
Just take the walk!
But, coach, wait!
Don't swing!
Nervous, gangly, barely able to hold
the pine, Little advances to the box.
He's going to bat from the right.
Make it the left. No, the right.
The right.
Easy out!
Looks like left field's
found something better to do,
center field's got a hunger pang
in his second stomach
and right field's digging for grubs.
Play ball!
Why him? Why now?
I won't embarrass you, Dad.
Not this time.
Here's the windup, the pitch!
It's a high cutter.
Ball!
Strike one!
I'm not going to sugarcoat it.
I've seen roadkill with faster reflexes.
The catcher lays down the signals.
Here's the pitch.
Curve ball low and outside, he swings!
Strike two!
No!
I said, don't swing!
Don't swing!
No!
Batter up!
Two in the hole!
One more strike, it's a punch out,
folks, and we're all going home.
Today is a new day.
Don't swing!
Well, take away my squeaky toy!
It's a hit!
A hit?
A hit?
A hit?
A hit?
But wait! The batter
is still at home plate.
He's standing in a daze.
Run, kid, run!
Go, son! Run! Run!
Run!
There he goes,
headed the wrong way.
Wait, wait, wait!
No, no! Not that way!
Run the other way!
Turn around!
Wait, wait! He's turned!
I've never said these words before,
but he's actually
rounding home plate!
Goosey Loosey steps on home...
Today's a new day!
We have a tie game!
They're scrambling in the alley.
Looks like Rodriguez has it.
Nope, it's the center fielder!
Mayhem in the outfield,
as Rodriguez is fired to second.
Catch is complete,
but where's the ball?
Little touches the bag
and keeps going. A hunt for the rock.
The fielders are having trouble.
Commotion out there!
It's stuck! It's stuck!
Tip the cow!
It's the old tipthecow play.
The kid heads for the hot corner,
a standup triple!
Yes!
Hold up! No!
He's going for the whole enchilada!
The ball of wax,
kit and the caboodle!
Go back!
You're never gonna make it!
He's trying to lighten his load!
The outfield behind,
Little's on all cylinders!
He slides for the dish!
It's going to be a photo finish at home!
You're out!
Oh, folks.
Folks, what a heartbreaker.
Wait!
Wait, wait!
Wait a cottonpicking second.
Hold your horses, here,
and horses hold your breath.
This might not be over. He...
He's...
Safe! The runner is safe!
It's all over, folks!
The Acorns have done the impossible!
For the first time in 20 years,
we won the pennant!
Mothers, kiss your babies!
You've witnessed a miracle!
Remember where you were at this
moment. The smells! The sounds!
There's a new winner in town
and his name is Chicken Little!
That was just a lucky hit!
Yes, Chicken Little, it's all yours!
The victory, the triumph, the glory!
And getting doused with a sticky drink
that soaks into your undies
and chafes for hours!
This is one memory you'll savor forever!
Yeah!
Yes, yes, yes! We won! We won!
That's my boy out there!
That's my boy!
I am the champion, my friend
And I'll keep on fightin'
till the end
I am the champion
I am the champion
But gone is the loser
'Cause I am the champion
Of the world
Here's the windup and the pitch!
A knuckleball!
He swings!
Crack!
It's going.
He rounds first, to second!
It hits high off the wall!
He flies past third
and heads for the plate!
It's a scramble for the ball!
It's gonna be close!
He is safe!
The mighty Acorns win!
Yes! Acorns win!
The mighty Acorns win!
Geez, you know,
I guess that puts the whole
"sky is falling" incident
behind us once and for all.
Hey, kiddo?
You bet, Dad.
Unless you think we need... closure?
Closure? What's to close here?
Unless you think we need to close...
Not me.
It's closed!
I agree. Vacuum sealed.
Shut tight!
OK, great, Dad. You...
Closure, I dunno.
All right. Enough fun.
Good talk. Good talk, son.
Here, I'll give you a push.
Rock me a little. Help me.
OK.
OK, I'm up.
Hey.
Good night, Ace.
Here's the windup...
and the pitch!
Thanks.
Thanks for the chance.
No!
A piece of the sky?!
Shaped like a stop sign?! Not again!
Hey! Son!
You all right? I'm coming!
I'm coming! I'm comin' upstairs!
What's wrong?
Nothing.
You sure?
I thought I heard you yell.
No.
I fell out of bed.
How'd you get over there?
Over where?
There. There!
Where?
How'd you get over there?
Who're we talking about?
Never mind. What's the difference?
Look, the past is behind us, right?
Tomorrow's gonna be a new day.
Please be gone,
please be gone, please be gone...
Good.
No.
No.
I gotta call Abby!
Yo, I'll tell you what I want
What I really really want
Tell me what you want
What you really really want
I'll tell you what I want
What I really really want
So tell me what you want
What you really really want
I wanna, I wanna
I wanna, I wanna
Really really
really wanna zigazig ah
If you wanna be my lover
You gotta get with my friends
Gotta get with my friends
Make it last forever
Friendship never ends
If you wanna be my lover
You have got to give
Taking is too easy
But that's the way it is
Hello! Mallard residence.
Tell you what I want
Runt! Quiet! I'm on the phone!
I wanna, I wanna
I wanna, I wanna
I wanna really...
Runt!
Hey! Where are you?
We already started. We were just...
It opened up!
What?!
All right, guys. Watch this.
Bizarre.
OK. Lemme guess.
You haven't told your dad yet.
Well...
I knew it!
Why haven't you told him?
There hasn't been
"you, your dad, talktalktalking. "
There was talking.
There was definitely talking.
Really? What did he say?
What?
All right, that's it.
We are doing an intervention!
You have got to stop messing
around and deal with the problem!
She's right!
Abby, please.
This is what
fell on me the first time.
There's no way I'm
bringing this up again.
No, he's not.
Runt!
Sorry! I'm a gutless flipflopper.
OK. I'm sure there's
a simple, logical explanation.
I mean, it could be
a piece of weather balloon,
or maybe it's part of some
experimental communications satellite.
I don't care. I want it
out of my life, gone for good.
Everything back to normal.
Hey, remember when that
icy blue stuff fell from the sky?
Everybody thought
it was from space and stuff?
And it just turned out to be
frozen pee from a jet airplane.
Yeah, that's right.
It's frozen pee.
Yeah. It's frozen pee.
Pee, pee, pee, pee pee.
Could you stop saying that?
What? Pee?
Pee.
Tinkle?
Piddle? Weewee?
Whiz?
OK, subject change.
Make pishee?
I don't care what it is!
Are you gonna help me
get rid of it or not?
Flying Fish! Take cover!
Fish!
No!
Fish!
Come on, come on, come on!
Wait, wait, whoa, son!
Where's the fire here?
Chicken Little has something to
tell you! Tell him. He can handle it.
Who're we talkin' about?
Gotta go, Dad! Bye!
You got to be ready
to listen to your children,
even if they have nothing to say.
Sit tight, Fish!
Fish! We will try to save you!
I'm sorry! Wait!
Sorry!
Curb!
Fish!
Abby!
Abby! Wake up!
Come on! Let's get outta here!
Oh, poor Fish!
He's probably stuffed and mounted
like an intergalactic trophy or...
...maybe he's a halfliving host
implanted with facehugging babies.
One thing's for sure, man. He's gone!
Gone, man!
Not yet!
Oh, snap.
Fish.
Hey! What are you doing? Come on!
Fish.
Fish.
Where are you, Fish?!
I can't handle the pressure!
Go on without me!
Runt.
You're just fine.
I'll jeopardize the mission!
Endanger us all!
Throw me overboard
while you still have a chance!
Just leave me some ammo, little
water, some chips if you have 'em.
Calm. OK, all right. Listen.
Where's your bag?
Everything's OK.
Now breathe.
Breathe.
No, slowly.
Slowly.
Slowly.
OK. Now, just do
the thing you do to relax.
Well, you can tell by the way
I use my walk I'm a woman's man
No time to talk
Stayin' alive, stayin' alive'
Fish!
Fish! Are you OK?
Did they hurt you? Say something!
Don't tap the glass.
They hate it when you do that.
All right, let's get out of here.
Where's Runt?
We're next.
Run!
OK! That's it!
We're running back to your house.
Tell your dad!
OK! You're right, you're right!
Stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Stayin' alive
Oh, Runt!
Push! Push! No!
Runt!
No! Not pull! Push!
We gotta get outta here right now!
Come on...
No! Come on, you guys! Hu...
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
OK, time out!
So... have you been to the mall?
Come on, buddy.
Come on, buddy.
I'm sorry.
Tension makes me bloat.
Come on, guys! Hurry, hurry, hurry!
Look out!
Thanks! Curse these
genetically tiny legs!
What's that noise?
Sorry. Nervous eater.
Run!
Wait! Fish!
The school bell! We've got to ring
the school bell to warn everyone!
Come on!
Hurry! Hurry!
Go! Go!
It's locked!
They're... they're comin'.
I need a soda.
Come on, buddy.
Come on, buddy!
The corner's wrinkled!
Why are we doing this?
Come on, take it, take it!
Yes!
Come on! Work! Work!
Work! You work!
What happened?
I blacked out there for a second.
The sky is falling!
The sky is falling!
It was just an acorn. A little acorn!
I can't tell you
how embarrassed I am, folks.
Ring the bell!
Come on, Chicken Little!
Ring the bell!
What?
Let's check the weather with Riz.
A cold front is moving in so...
The alarm bell has been activated!
Quick! Get a camera crew!
Chicken Little! You better
have a good explanation for this!
There's, there's... It's a...
You have to... D'oh! Doo wah!
What did he say?
There's... It's a... You have to...
D'oh! Doo wah!
Follow me! Come on!
Hurry! Hurry! Aliens here!
Aliens here!
It's... it's happening again.
Come on! Hurry! Hurry!
Come on. Come on.
You're about to see it!
Quick! Quick! It's taking off!
Come on! If you don't hurry,
you're gonna miss it!
Oh, look! A penny!
Guys!
Oh, right.
Hurry! Hurry!
Come on! Quick! It's taking off!
Come on! Hurry up! Please!
It's right in...
What are we lookin' for?
I don't know.
Yeah. OK. I know this looks bad,
but there's an
invisible spaceship right there
with aliens
who are here to invade Earth!
Let me show you.
Bad throw.
OK, let me try again.
Bad throw.
We all know I don't have a good arm,
but there's these
cloaking panels on the bottom.
They make it disappear. One fell out
of the sky and hit me right on the head.
It's the acorn thing all over again.
There's no story here.
At least we can sell
the video to Chickens Gone Wild.
I'm telling ya, it was here!
No, wait! There were aliens!
It's true! They had eyes...
They're glowing and then tentacles!
And maps with planets
with x's through them!
Runt, that's enough!
Don't make Mommy take away
your Streisand collection!
Mom? You leave Barbra out of this!
Why can't you keep that
child of yours under control?
What kind of parent are you?
Everybody, I'm telling the truth.
Dad! Dad! I'm not making this up!
You gotta believe me this time.
No, son. I don't.
I can't tell you
how embarrassed I am, folks.
I'm really sorry about this, everyone.
Looks like this is just
a big, crazy misunderstanding.
Well, other than the penny,
this whole evening was a wash!
Mr. Cluck, don't take it so hard.
No one blames you.
Reports of panic and mayhem
are pouring in
after yet another
Chicken Little incident last night.
In one instance, a family
of lemmings was sent running in fear,
but unable to find a cliff,
they instead began throwing themselves
from the nearest park bench.
Hello? I'm sorry.
Hello? I apologize.
Hello? Give me break! Hello?
What? You were trampled?
That's terrible.
I thought rabbits' feet
were supposed to be lucky.
You have hate mail.
I'm truly sorry. That wasn't funny.
You have more hate mail.
Hi. What are you saying, sir?
Your hate mail box is full.
Oh, yes.
I do see the skywriting there.
Thank goodness the cloud
blocked the last letter. Hello?
Hey, hey, hey!
Watch your mouth. Yeah?
Oh, yeah?
Well, I'd like to see you try.
OK, I love you too, Mom. Bye.
Hello? Really. Well...
If there was ever a time
to talk to your dad, it's now.
It's too late for that.
It's too late, baby,
now it's too late.
Though they really
did try to make it.
Runt.
Just think about it.
Something inside has died
and they just can't hide
and they just can't fake it.
Oh, no, no.
Runt, I just really want
to be alone right now.
Abby! Runt! Fish!
Look! There!
Look there! Look there!
What is that thing?!
Look at that!
His name is Kirby?
They left him behind?
Darth Vader is Luke's father?
No, don't...
Come on, come on, don't cry.
We're here for you. We're gonna do
whatever it takes to get you back home.
Here, blow.
OK.
See, guys? He's cool.
He was just freaked out. That's all.
Run!
Those are your parents?
And they brought the galactic armada?
Watch out for the kid! Don't hit him!
There you are. Get in the car.
I gotta tell you something.
What?
I know, I know! You were right!
Alien invasion. I see that now.
Look up! There it is!
Dad, you know, about that...
It's actually just a rescue mission.
Rescue mission?
This alien kid was left
and they're coming back to get him!
We have to help him,
'cause if we don't, who else will?
What?!
Forget it.
You wouldn't believe me anyway.
Son!
Son, come back!
Son! Chicken Little!
Mr. Cluck! Wait!
He's telling the truth!
He is! Though, given his track record,
we understand why you don't believe him!
It's the end of the world
as we know it
It's the end of the world
as we know it
It's the end of the world
as we know it
And I feel fine
It's the end of the world
as we know it
It's the end of the world
as we know it
And I feel fine
Watch out for the kid! No! Don't!
Don't hit him! Don't hit... Look out!
Chicken Little!
What? Where's your head?
We gotta get outta here!
Come on! Come o...
You, with the running and the jumping!
Dad. No, wait.
What are you guys doing?
We gotta get outta here!
It's like
War of the Worlds out there!
Stop pulling!
Just listen to me for one second!
It's not dangerous!
We are under attack!
Will you two stop messing around
and deal with the problem?
You're never there for me!
What?
OK, that's not what
I had in mind, but...
You're never there for me.
I mean,
you were when I won the game,
but not when I thought the sky fell.
And not at the ball field
and not now!
This is good!
Keep going. Keep going!
You've been ashamed
since the acorn thing.
We have to talk because
Modern Mallard says avoiding closure
can lead to molting.
I'm already small
and I don't think
I could handle being bald!
I didn't... realize, son.
I never meant to...
The acorn, the sky,
I mean, the whole...
You're right. You're right.
Your mom, she was...
You know, she was
always good with stuff like this.
Me...
...I'm gonna need a lot of work.
But you need
to know that I love you,
no matter what.
And I'm sorry I...
And I'm sorry if I ever made
you feel like that was something...
...you had to earn.
And we're good. Let's go. Let's go.
OK, Dad. Now, all we gotta do
is return helpless little Kirby.
OK, Dad. Now, all we gotta do
is return helpless little Kirby.
Return this whatever it is?
This is crazy! Crazy!
Crazy wonderful!
Just tell me what you need me to do.
Do you really mean it?
You bet! Anything, son.
Come on, Dad.
We've got a planet to save!
Crazy supportive. That's me!
This thing likes to nibble, doesn't it?
By the way, I'd like to say I've
always found you extremely attractive!
Now that's closure.
Wait! Wait! What's goin' on?!
They've given her
an alien mindwipe!
OK, son. What do we do now?
OK. This is a piece of cake, Dad.
All we have to do is take the kid down
the street to the giant metal alien.
We surrender! Here!
Take the key to the city!
Key to my car?
Tic Tac?
Forget plan A!
OK, OK, what now, son?
Who, by the way,
I support 100 percent.
Plan B?
Of course! Plan B! What is plan B?
What? You have to go to the bathroom?
You want juice?
A snack?
Corn dog on a stick?
Want to play some golf?
What do you want?!
I stink at this.
I'm a horrible father.
No, no, no, I am. I am.
Is that your parents?
That's it, Dad! Plan B!
All we have to do is weave
through traffic through town square
while avoiding death rays
from alien robots.
We get to Town Hall,
climb up to the roof
and give the kid
back to its parents.
Yeah!
Charge!
Now that's what
I call takin' out the trash!
OK, son. Now what?
Fire truck!
Plan C!
Runt, no! Turn around!
Go back to Town Hall!
But they'll vaporize us!
You want me to do what?
Runt, just do it! It'll work!
We'll survive!
I will survive?
Brake, Abby!
OK.
Floor it!
Deploy ladder, Fish!
I'll survive
I will survive
Hey, hey
Plan D.
Plan D.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Thighs hurting.
Drumsticks burning.
But loving you!
Full support!
I can't get out!
Come back, son!
We can't go out this way!
It's dangerous.
No, Dad, I can do this!
It's too dangerous.
I can do this. I can.
You gotta believe me this time.
I...
I do, son.
OK, hang on tight.
Yes!
Here's your kid! Look over here!
Here's your kid!
He's OK!
He's all right!
Stop the invasion!
Son! Son!
I'm here, son!
Dad! Look out!
Get away from my boy! Get away!
The mighty Acorns...
Tic Tac?
Why did you take our child?
Just... Just hold on there, buddy!
My son did not take your kid!
You were the one
that left him behind!
That's bad parenting!
And I should know!
Silence!
Release the child!
OK.
OK, OK.
Sweetheart! Oh, Kirby,
I'm so happy to see you! My darling!
That was close.
At least they're back together.
They got their kid.
You have violated
intergalactic law 90210!
A charge punishable
by immediate particle disintegration!
Oh, snap.
What's that?
I don't quite...
Melvin, honey? He's saying
they're telling the truth.
It was just a misunderstanding.
Well, then. This is awkward.
Yes, it is.
I suppose I should...
Put the big guns away?
Yes, yes.
Now put them down.
Of course.
And turn off your big voice.
But I don't...
Turn it off.
But...
But I don't get to use
the big voice very often!
Melvin.
Yes, dear.
Hi. Anyone want
to try the big voice?
Again, I cannot tell you how sorry
we are for this whole misunderstanding.
Oh, dear goodness.
We are so very sorry.
We are. And if it
hadn't been for your son there,
well, we might have
vaporized the whole planet.
What?
Goodness!
What a shame that would have been.
Tell 'em!
Where would we pick acorns?
We stop here
on the way to the inlaws.
Every year.
Looked on all the other planets.
You only find them on Earth.
As it says on your graphic display.
That caught our eyes.
OK, everything's
been put back to normal,
except for this one, over here.
Hi, y'all!
Foxy?
Lollipop, lollipop
Oh, lolli lolli lolli
Lollipop...
She got her brainwaves
scrambled during reconstitution.
No worries!
We can put her back the way she was.
No! She's perfect.
Lollipop!
Lollipop!
Scary.
Darling! Look at the time!
We better get a move on.
All right, then.
It was good meetin' ya.
Sorry for the whole
fullscale invasion thing.
But, hey, I'm a dad.
You know how it is with your kids.
When they need ya,
you do whatever it takes.
There goes that panel again.
Every year we come,
this thing falls off.
Seriously, honey, someday it's
going to hit somebody on the head.
Nonsense!
You can't return the panel, can you?
Now that's ridiculous.
You threw away the receipt again.
Silence!
Melvin, did you just try
and use the big voice on me?
Who we talkin' about?
So I'd like to see the movie
they make about you now.
So I'd like to see the movie
they make about you now.
I just hope they stay true
to what really happened.
Oh, son, these people
are from Hollywood!
The one thing they'll never do...
...is mess with a good story.
Red alert! Man your battle stations!
Status report, Mr. Fish.
Commander Little,
the evil Foxloxian Army
has broken through
the planet's atmosphere.
But that means...
Yes, I know.
The sky... is falling.
Commander Little! No!
Please... call me...
...Ace.
Oh, Ace! No!
I never intended
to bring you into this... Abby.
Runt, do you copy?
Yes, commander?
Runt, my friend, an alien fleet
is about to invade Earth.
Civilization as we know it
depends on me
and, to a lesser extent... you.
So I've just got one question for you:
Are you ready to rock?
Ain't no mountain high enough,
ain't no valley low...
Ain't no mountain high enough
Raise your pork shield, Runt.
Prepare to engage.
Stay on target.
Stay on target!
Give 'em a taste
of the other white meat!
Cap'n! Look out!
Runt!
Runt, are you all right?
No, no. Ya gotta go on
without me, commander.
Just leave me some ammo,
a little water,
some chips if you have 'em.
This is amazingly accurate.
He was my good friend.
Oh, Abby.
At least I still have you... Abby.
Ace!
Abby.
Ace!
Good people of Oakey Oaks.
Though at times it may feel
like the sky is falling around you,
never give up.
For every day... is a new day!
A new day!
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Oh, Ace!
To keep me from you
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wild enough
To keep me from you
Ain't no mountain high enough
Nothing can keep me
Keep me from you
Ain't no mountain high enough
Nothing can keep me
Keep me from you
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wild enough
To keep me from you
To keep me from you
Nothing in this world
Nothing in this world
Can keep me from you, babe
Just call my name
Don't go breaking my heart
I couldn't if I tried
Oh, honey, if I get restless
Baby, you're not that kind
And nobody knows it
When I was down
I was your clown
And nobody knows it
Nobody knows
Right from the start
I gave you my heart
I gave you my heart
Don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my
Don't go breaking my
Don't go breaking my heart
Don't go breaking my
Don't go breaking my
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my
Don't go breaking my
Don't go breaking my heart
Come on, Runt. You can do it.
Don't go breaking my
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my
Don't go breaking my
You got to act quickly, Dad.
Try this.
Don't go breaking my
There you go!
Don't go breaking my
There it is!
I won't go breaking your heart
I'm having fun now!
Don't go breaking my heart
That was great!
Let's sing it again!
