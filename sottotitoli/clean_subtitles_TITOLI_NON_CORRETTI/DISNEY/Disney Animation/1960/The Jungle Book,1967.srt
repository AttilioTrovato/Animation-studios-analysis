Many strange legends are told
Of these jungles of India...
but none so strange as the story
of a small boy named Mowgli.
It all began when the silence
Of the jungle was broken by
an unfamiliar sound.
It was a sound like one never heard
before in this part of the jungle.
It was a man cub!
Had I known how deeply
I was to be involved...
I would've obeyed my
first impulse and walked away.
This man cub would have to
have nourishment, and soon.
It was many days travel
to the nearest man village...
and without a mother's care,
he would soon perish.
Then it occurred to me.
A family of wolves I knew
had been blessed with a litter of cubs.
Oh, I knew there'd be no problem
with the mother thanks to
the maternal instinct, but...
I wasn't so sure
about Rama, the father.
Ten times the rains
had come and gone.
And I often stopped by to see how Mowgli
the man cub was getting along.
He was a favorite of all
the young wolf cubs of the pack.
No man cub was
ever happier.
And yet, I knew
that someday...
he would have to go back
to his own kind.
Then one night, the wolf pack
elders met at council rock...
because Shere Khan
the tiger...
had returned to
their part of the jungle.
This meeting was to change
the man cub's entire future.
Shere Khan will surely kill the boy
and all who try to protect him.
Now, are we all in agreement
as to what must be done?
Now it is my unpleasant duty
to tell the boy's father.
Rama. Uh, come
over here, please.
Yes, Akela?
The council has reached its decision.
The man cub can no longer
stay with the pack.
He must leave at once.
Leave?
I'm sorry, Rama.
There is no other way.
But__ But the man cub is__
Well, he's like my own son.
Surely he's entitled to
the protection of the pack.
But, Rama, even the strength of the pack
is no match for the tiger.
But the boy cannot survive
alone in the jungle.
Akela. Perhaps
I can be of help.
You, Bagheera? How?
I know of a man village
where he'll be safe.
Mowgli and I have taken many
walks into the jungle together,
so I'm sure he'll go with me.
So be it. Now there's
no time to lose. Good luck.
Bagheera.
I'm getting a little sleepy.
Shouldn't we start back home?
Mowgli, this time
we're not going back.
I'm taking you to a man village.
But why?
Because Shere Khan has returned
to this part of the jungle.
And he has sworn
to kill you.
Kill me? But why would he
wanna do that?
He hates man.
And Shere Khan is not going to allow you
to grow up to become a man__
just another hunter
with a gun.
Aw, we'll just explain to him that
I'd never do a thing like that.
Nonsense. No one explains
anything to Shere Khan.
Well, maybe so.
But I'm not afraid.
And besides, I__
Now that's enough.
We'll spend the night here.
Things will look better in the morning.
Man cub? Man cub!
Now come on, up this tree.
Be safer up there.
I don't wanna go back
to the man village.
Go on. Up you go.
That limb way up there?
That's right.
Is that all the better
you can climb?
I__ Oh__ It's
too big around.
And besides, I don't
have any claws.
Now, get some sleep.
We've got a long journey
ahead of us tomorrow.
I__ I wanna stay
in the jungle.
Huh? You wouldn't
last one day.
I'm not afraid. II can
look out for myself.
Say now, what have we here?
It's a man cub.
A delicious man cub.
Oh, go away and
leave me alone.
Oh, that's just what I
should do, but I'm not.
Now, now, please go
to sleep, man cub.
Yes, man cub.
Please go to sleep.
Please go to sleep
Sleep, little man cub
Rest in peace
Sleep. Sleep.
Ba__ BaBaghgheera.
Oh, now__ Now look, there's
no use arguing any more.
Oh! Now no more talk
till morning.
He won't be here
in the morning.
Hmm? Oh, yes, he will.
I__ Kaa!
Hold it, Kaa!
Oh! My sinus.
You have just made
a serious mistake, my friend.
A very stupid...
Now, now, now, now, Kaa, I was__
mistake.
Look me in the eye when
I'm speaking to you.
Oh, please, Kaa.
Both eyes, if you please.
You have just
sealed your doom.
Look, Bagheera!
Look, Bagheera.
Wake up, Bagheera.
Just you wait till
I get you in my coils.
Bagheera, he's got
a knot in his tail!
"He's got a knot
in his tail."
Ooh, this is going to
slow down my slither.
So, you can look out
For yourself, can you?
So you want to stay
in the jungle, do you?
Yes. I wanna stay
in the jungle.
Oh! Now, now, now for
the last time, go to sleep!
Man cub.
Man cub.
Hup, two, three, four
Keep it up
Two, three, four
Hup, two, three, four
Keep it up
Two, three, four
Hup, two, three, four
A parade.
Oh, no!
The dawn patrol again.
Company, sound off!
Oh, the aim of our patrol
Is a question rather droll
For to march and drill
Over field and hill
Is a military goal
Is a military goal
With a hup
Two, three, four
Dress it up
two, three, four
By the ranks or single file
Over every jungle mile
Oh, west amp and crush
through the underbrush
In the military style
In the military style
Hello. What are you doing?
Shh! Drilling.
Can I do it too?
Sure. Just do what I do.
But don't talk in ranks.
It's against regulations.
To the rear! March!
The other way.
Turn around.
Hup, two, three, four
Keep it up
Two, three, four
To the rear! Ho!
Company, halt!
That means stop.
Company, left face!
March, march, march.
My feet are killing me.
I'm puttin' in for
a transfer to another herd.
Silence in the ranks!
Dress up that line.
Pull it in, Winifred.
Inspection! Arms!
Stick your nose out.
Like this?
That's right.
A dusty muzzle.
Soldier, remember, in battle,
that trunk can save your life.
Take good care of it, my man.
Yes, sir!
Very good. Cary on.
Let's have a little more spit
and polish on those bayonets.
Yes, sir.
Esprit de corps.
That's the way I earned my commission in
the Maharajah's fifth pachyderm brigade.
Back in '88, it was.
Uh, or was it?
Here it comes.
The Victoria Cross bit again.
It was then I received
the Victoria Cross...
for bravely above and
beyond the call of duty.
Those were the days.
Discipline.
Discipline was the thing.
Builds character, and all that
sort of thing, you know.
Oh, oh, where was I?
Oh, yes. Inspection.
Well, very good.
Wipe off that silly grin, soldier.
This is the army.
Eyes front.
Lieutenant, that haircut
is not regulation.
Rather on the gaudy side,
don't you think?
There. That's better.
And as for you__
Oh, there you are.
Let's keep those heels
together, shall we, son?
Okay, Pop. Sir.
Yes, now that's better.
Well, a new recruit, eh?
I say, what happened
to your trunk?
Hey! Stop that!
A man cub!
Oh, this is treason!
Sabotage! I'll have
no man cub in my jungle!
IIt's not your jungle!
Hold it! Hold it! I can explain, Hathi.
Colonel Hathi,
If you please, sir.
Oh, yes, yes.
Colonel Hathi.
Uh, the man cub is with me.
I'm taking him back to the man village.
To stay?
You have the word of Bagheera.
Good. And remember,
an elephant never forgets.
I don't know what the army's
coming to these days.
These young whippersnappers,
who do they think they are?
Let's get on with it!
Right face!
Forward march!
Dear, haven't you
forgotten something?
Nonsense, Winifred old girl.
An elephant never forgets.
Well, you just
forgot our son.
Uh, uh, son__ Son?
Son! Oh, yes, yeah, yeah!
Quite right.
To the rear! March!
When I grow up, I'm gonna be
a Colonel, just like my__
If I've told you once, I've
told you a thousand times__
Oh!
Pop! Look out!
Gee, Pop, you forgot
to say "halt."
He said an elephant
never forgets.
It's not funny.
Now let's get out of here quick
before anything else happens.
Bagheera!
Where are we goin'?
You're going back to
the man village right now.
I'm not going.
Oh, yes, you are!
I'm staying right here!
You're going if I have to
drag you every step of the way.
Let go, you__
You let go of me!
Oh, that does it.
I've had it, man cub!
From now on, you're
on your own alone!
Don't worry about me.
Foolish man cub.
Doobee doobee
doobeedeedoo
Well, it'sa doobahdeedoo
Yes, it'sa doobahdeedoo
lmean a doobee doobee, doobee
doobee, doobeedeedoo
And with__
Well, now.
What have we here?
Hey, what a funny
little bit of a__
Oh!
Go away!
Oh, boy, I've seen
everything in these woods.
Hoo! What have I run on?
What a pretty thing this is.
Leave me alone.
Well, now.
That's pretty big talk,
little britches.
I'm big enough.
Pitiful. Hey, kid,
you need help.
And old Baloo's gonna learn you
to fight like a bear.
Now come on,
I'm gonna show you.
Yeah!
All right, now, kid, loosen up.
Get real loose and then start to weave.
Weave a little.
Now move! That's it!
Now give me a big bear growl.
Scare me.
Oh, boy.
I'm talkin' about
like a big bear.
He's in trouble! Why, II
shouldn't have left him alone.
A big one. Right from your toes.
How's that?
Yeah, you're gettin' it, kid.
Oh, no! It's Baloo.
That shiftless,
stupid jungle bum.
Weave about now and
look for an opening.
Keep movin'. Keep__
Yeah, you're gettin' it, kid.
Come on, that's it.
He's a dandy.
Fine teacher you are,
old iron paws.
Oh, thanks, Bagheera.
Eh, tell me, tell me, uh...
after you knock your pupil
senseless, uh, how do you expect
him to remember the lesson? Hmm?
Well, I__ I, uh__ Well, I didn't
mean to lay it on him so hard.
I'm not hurt.
I'm all right.
I'm a lot tougher than
some people think.
You better believe it.
Now let's go once more.
Now I want you to keep circlin'
or I'm gonna knoc kyour roof in again.
You better keep movin'.
Hey! Right on the button.
No, nono, nono.
Now you're ticklin'.
No! No. NNNow, now we don't
do that here in the jungle.
No, you're ticklin'.
II can't stand that ticklin'.
Help, Bagheera!
Oh, boy, that's all he needs.
More confidence.
Give up, Baloo?
I give up, I told ya.
Ooh! I give__ Hey!
You know somethin'? You're all right,
kid. What do they call you?
Mowgli. And he's going back
to the man village right now.
Man village? They'll ruin him.
They'll make a man out of him.
Oh, Baloo, I wanna
stay here with you.
Certainly you do.
Oh? And just how do you
think he will survive?
"How do you think he will__" What do
you mean, "How do you think he__"
He's with me, ain't he?
And I'll learn him all I know.
Well, that shouldn't
take too long.
Look, now it's like this,
little britches.
All you've gotta do is__
Look forthe bare necessities
The simple bare necessities
Forget about your worries
And your strife
I mean the bare necessities
are Mother Nature's recipes
That bring the bare
necessities of life
Wherever I wander
Wherever I roam
I couldn't be fonder
Of my big home
The bee sare buzzin' in the tree
to make some honey just for me
When you look under
the rocks and plants
And take a glance
at the fancy ants
Then maybe try a few
You eat ants?
You better believe it. And you're
gonna love the way they tickle.
Mowgli, look out!
The bare necessities
of life will come to you
But when?
They'll come to you
Look for the bare necessities
The simple bare necessities
Forget about your worries
And your strife
I mean the bare necessities
That's why a bear
can rest at ease
With just the bare necessities
Of life
Now when you pick a paw paw
Or a prickly pear
Ow!
And you prick a raw paw
Well, next time, beware
Don't pick the prickly pear
By the paw
When you pick a pear
Try to use the claw
But you don't need to use the claw
When you pick a pear of the big paw paw
Have I given you a clue?
Golly. Thanks, Baloo.
Pawpaw.
Of all the silly gibberish.
Come on, Baghee,
get with the beat.
The bare necessities
of life will come to you
They'll come to me!
They'll come to you
How 'bout scratchin' that ol' left
shoulder while you're up there, Mowgli?
Now just a hair lower.
There. Right there. That's it.
Oh! This is beautiful.
That's good.
Kid, we've got to get to a tree.
This calls for some big scratchin'.
You're lots of fun, Baloo.
Right on it. Yeah!
That's delicious.
Just a little bit__
Yeah!
Yeah.
Oh, man, this is
really livin'.
So just try and relax.
Yeah. Cool it.
Fall apart in my backyard.
'Cause let me tell you somethin',
little britches.
If you act like
that bee acts...
uhuh, you're
workin' too hard.
And don't spend your time
lookin' around...
for something you want
that can't be found.
When you find out you can live without
it and go along not thinkin' about it
I'll tell you somethin' true
The bare necessities
Of life will come to you
I give up. Well, I hope
his luck holds out.
Mowgli, how 'bout you sing?
Look for the bare necessities
The simple bare necessities
Forget about your worries
and your strife
Yeah, man.
I mean the bare necessities
That's why a bear
can rest at ease
With just the bare necessities
Of life
Yeah!
With just the bare necessities of life
Yeah, man!
Beautiful!
That's real jungle harmony.
I like being a bear.
That's my boy.
And you're gonna make one swell bear.
Why, you even sing like one.
Hey, Mowgli, how 'bout you
flickin' that old, mean fly...
of fo' your
papa bear's nose?
Ouch!
Boy, when you flick a fly,
you really__
Why you flatnosed,
littleeyed, flaky creep!
Hey! Let go of me!
Take your fleapickin' hands
Of fo' my cub!
Come on and get him, champ!
He ain't no champ. He's a chump!
Baloo!
Yeah! A big hothead!
Okay, you guys asked for it.
I'll__
That'll cool him off.
Gimme back my man cub!
Here he is.
Come and get him!
That's how a bear
can rest at ease.
Here's some bare necessities.
Now just try that again, you__
What's that you hit him with, son?
That was a bare necessity.
Look, monk, you turn him loose
or I'll jerk a knot in your tail__
We give up!
Here he comes!
Baloo! Catch me!
Baloo!
Back up! Back up!
Faster! Faster! Faster!
A rolling bear
gathers no hair!
Baloo! Help me!
Baloo, they're carrying me away!
Bagheera!
Bagheera!
Well, it's happened.
Took a little longer than I thought,
but it's happened.
Bagheera!
Oh, you heard me, huh?
Mowgli. Mowgli!
All right, what happened?
Where's Mowgli?
They ambushed me.
Thousands of'em.
I jabbed with my left. Then I swung
with a right. And then I let__
Oh, for the last time,
what happened to Mowgli?
Like I told ya, them
mangy monkeys carried him off.
The ancient ruins.
Oh, I hate to think what'll happen
when he meets that king of theirs.
We got him, King Louie!
Here he is. Man, we got him.
We got him!
So you're the man cub.
Crazy.
I'm not as crazy as you are.
Put me down!
You cut that out!
Cool it, boy.
Unwind yourself.
Now come on,
let's shake, cousin.
What do you want me for?
Word has grabbed my royal ear__
Have a banana__
that you wanna
stay in the jungle.
Stay in the jungle?
I sure do.
Well, good.
And old King Louie__
That's me__
can fix it for you.
Have two bananas.
Have we got a deal?
Yes, sir.
I'll do__ I'll do anything
to stay in the jungle.
Well, then.
I'll lay it on
the line for you.
Now I'm the king of the swingers
Oh, the jungle VlP
I've reached the top
And had to stop
And that's what's botherin' me
I wanna be a man, man cub
And stroll right into town
And be just like the other men
I'm tired of monkeyin' around
Oh, oohbeedoo
I wanna be likeyou
I wanna walk like you
Talk like you too
You see it's true
An ape like me
Can learn to be human too
What?
Gee, Cousin Louie,
you're doin' real good.
Now here's your part
Of the deal, cuz.
Lay the secret on me
of man's red fire.
But I don't know
how to make fire.
Now don't try to kid me, man cub
I made a deal with you
What I desire
Is man's red fire
To make my dream come true
Now give me the secret, man cub
Come on, clue me what to do
Give me the power
Of man's red flower
So I can be like you
Fire? So that's what
that scoundrel's after.
I'll tear him limb from limb.
I'll beat him.
I'll__ I'll__
Yeah!
Well, man, what a beat.
Will you stop that silly
beat business and listen?
This will take brains,
not brawn.
You better believe it,
and I'm loaded with both.
Will you listen?
Oh. Yeah, yeah.
Now, while you
create a disturbance...
I'll rescue Mowgli.
Got that?
I'm gone, man. Solid gone.
Not yet, Baloo!
Hey!
Get mad, baby.
You
l wanna be like you
l wanna walk like you
Talk like you too
You see it's true
Someone like me
Can learn to be
Like someone like me
Take me home, daddy!
Can learn to be
Like someone like you
One more time!
Yeah, can learn to be
Like someone like me
Man!
It's Baloo, the bear!
Yeah, that's him!
How'd that square get in there?
Baloo, it's you!
Man, that's what I call
a swingin' party.
And furthermore, Baloo...
Mowgli seems to have man's
ability to get into trouble.
And your influence
hasn't been exactly__
Shh. Keep it down.
You're gonna wake up little buddy.
Dah.
Well, he's had a big day.
It was a real sockaroo.
You know, it ain't easy
learnin' to be like me.
Pah!
A disgraceful performance.
Associating with those undesirable,
scatterbrained apes.
Unh. I hope Mowgli learned
something from that experience.
Scoobydooby,
doobydoo.
That's my boy.
Oh, nonsense.
Baloo.
Over here. I'd like
to have a word with you.
A word? You gonna
talk some more?
All right,
what's up, Bagheera?
Baloo...
the man cub must go back
to the man village.
The jungle is not
the place for him.
I grew up in the jungle.
Take a look at me.
Yes, just look at yourself.
Look at that eye.
Yeah. It's beautiful,
ain't it?
Yeah. Frankly, you're
a disreputable sight.
Well, you don't look exactly
like a basket off ruit yourself.
Ohh.
Baloo, you can't adopt
Mowgli as your son.
Why not?
HHHow can I put it?
It__ Baloo...
birds of a feather
should flock together.
You wouldn't marry
a panther, would you?
I don't know.
Come to think of it,
no panther ever asked me.
No. Baloo, youyou've got
to be serious about this.
Oh, stop woryin', Baghee.
Stop woryin'.
I'll take care of him.
Yes. Like you did when
the monkeys kidnapped him, huh?
Can't a guy make one mistake?
Not in the jungle.
And another thing.
Sooner or later, Mowgli
will meet Shere Khan.
The tiger? What's he got
against the kid?
He hates man with a vengeance.
You know that.
Because he fears man's gun
and man's fire.
But little Mowgli
don't have those things.
Shere Khan won't wait
until he does.
He'll get Mowgli while
he's young and helpless.
Just one swipe and__
No.
Well__ Well, what
are we gonna do?
We'll do what's best for the boy.
You better believe it.
You name it,
and I'll do it.
Good. Then make Mowgli
go to the man village.
Are you out of your mind?
I promised him...
he could stay here
in the jungle with me.
Well, that's just the point.
As long as he remains with you...
he's in danger,
so it's up to you.
Why me?
BeBeBecause he won't listen to me.
I love that kid.
I love him like
he was my own cub.
Then think of what's best
for Mowgli and not yourself.
Uh, well, can't__ Well,
can't I wait until morning?
It's morning now.
Go on, Baloo.
Uh__
Oh, boy.
Mowgli. Mowgli.
Uh, it's time to get up.
Oh. Hi, Baloo.
Hi. Hey, rub that old
sleep out of your eyes.
You and me, uh, we got
a long walk ahead of us.
Swell. Gee, we'll have
lots of fun together.
Sure. Yeah.
Yeah. Uh__
All right, let's
hit the trail, kid.
See ya around,
uh, Bagheera.
Well, goodbye, Bagheera.
Me and Baloo,
we've got things to do.
Goodbye, man cub.
And good luck.
Come on, Baloo.
All we gotta do is__
Look for the bare necessities
Some good old bare necessities
Forget about your worries
And your strife
l mean the bare necessities
That's why a bear
can rest at ease
With just the bare
necessities of life
Yeah I'll live here
in the jungle
All my life
Yeah, man
I like bein' a bear.
Where we goin', Baloo?
Well, uh, it's, uh__
Um, well, it's
sort of new and, uh__
Oh, I don't care,
as long as I'm with you.
Mowgli, uh,
look, buddy, uh...
there's somethin'
I gotta tell ya.
Tell me what, Baloo?
Gee whiz.
Now how did old Baghee
put it? It's, uh__
Uh, uh, Mowgli?
Ha! You wouldn't marry
a panther, would you?
Gee, I don't even know
what you're talkin' about.
Mowgli, don't you realize
that you're a human?
I'm not any more, Baloo.
I'm a bear like you.
Little buddy, look,
listen to me.
Come on. Come on, Baloo.
Now, Mowgli, stop it now.
Now hold still. II want
to tell you something.
Now listen to me.
What's the matter, old Papa Bear?
Look, Mowgli...
I been tyin' to tell ya.
I been tyin' all morning to tell ya.
I've got to take you
back to the man village.
The man village!
Now look, kid...
I can explain, and__
But, but you said we were partners.
Now believe me, kid, III__
You're just like, like old Bagheera!
Now just a minute.
That's goin' too far.
Hey, Mowgli,
where you goin'?
Wait a minute! Stop!
Wait!
Wait! Listen to old Baloo.
Mowgli. Mowgli!
Mowgli!
Mowgli. Mowgli!
Now what's happened?
Well, you, you, you're not
gonna believe me, Bagheera...
but look, now I used the same words
you did, and he ran out on me.
Well, don't just stand there.
Let's separate.
We__ We've got to find him.
Oh, if anything happens
to that little guy...
I'll never forgive myself.
I gotta find him.
Mowgli!
Mowgli.
Hup, two, three, four
Hup, two, three, four
Keep it up
Two, three
What beastly luck.
Confound that ridiculous
Colonel Hathi.
Company, sound off.
Oh, we march from here to there
And it doesn't matter where
You can hear us push
through the deepest bush
Hup, two, three, four
With a military air
With a military air
The jungle patrol.
We're a cracker jack brigade
On a pachyderm parade
But we'd rather stroll
to a waterhole
Hup, two, three, four
For a furlough in the shade
Stop! WWait a minute.
Halt!
Who said halt?
I give the commands around here.
Now speak up. Who was it?
Oh, it was me, Colonel.
What do you mean, sir,
taking over my command?
Highly irregular, you know.
Oh, Colonel, II'm sorry...
but, but I need your help.
Oh, absolutely impossible.
We're on a crosscounty march.
But it's an emergency, Colonel.
The man cub must be found.
Man cub? What man cub?
How interesting.
The one I was taking to the man village.
Good.
That's where he belongs.
Now, sir,
If you don't mind...
we'd like to get on
with the march.
No, no, no, you,
you don't understand, Hathi.
He is lost.
He ran away.
How delightful.
Well, serves the young
whippersnapper right.
But, but Shere Khan,
the tiger__
He's sure to pick up
the man cub's trail.
Shere Khan.
Nonsense, old boy.
Shere Khan isn't
within miles of here.
Oh, sorry, Bagheera.
Fortunes of war, and all that
sort of thing, you know.
This has gone far enough.
Far enough.
Now just a minute,
you pompous old windbag.
Winifred! What are you
doing out of ranks?
Never mind.
How would you like
to have our boy...
lost and alone
in the jungle?
Our son? WWell__
But, Winifred old girl,
that's an entirely different matter.
Huh!
Different, entirely.
That little boy is no different
than our own son.
Now you help find him,
or I'm taking over command.
What! A female
leading my herd?
Utterly preposterous.
Pop? The man cub and I
are friends.
He'll get hurt
If we don't find him.
Please, Pop? Sir?
Please?
Now don't you worry, son.
Your father had a plan
in mind all the time.
Sure you did.
Troopers!
Company, left face!
Volunteers for
a special mission...
will step
one pace forward.
That's what I like to see.
Devotion to duty.
Now, you volunteers
will find the lost man cub.
Oh, thank you, Colonel.
Now there's no time to lose.
Yes, yes.
Well, bugler.
When the man cub is sighted,
you will sound your trumpet...
three times.
Yes, sir.
Not now, soldier.
Sorry, sir.
Lieutenant, our strategy shall
be the element of surprise.
You will take one squad...
and cover the right flank.
Yes, sir.
And I shall lead
the other squad...
on the left flank.
Very well. Company...
forward march!
Element of surprise?
Oh, I say.
And now for my rendezvous
with the little lost man cub.
Kaa! It's you!
Yes, man cub.
So nice to see you again.
Oh, go away.
Leave me alone.
Let me look at you.
You don't want me
to look at you?
Then you look at me.
No, sir. I know what
you're tryin' to do, Kaa__
You do? Uh, I mean...
you don't trust me.
No.
Then there's nothing
I can do to help.
You wanna help me?
Certainly.
I can see to it that you never
have to leave this jungle.
How could you do that?
Hmm? Oh, I have my own...
subtle little ways.
But first,
you must trust me.
I don't trust
anyone any more.
I don't blame you.
I'm not like
those socalled...
fairweather friends
of yours.
You can believe in me.
Trust in me
Just in me
Shut your eyes
And trust in me
Hold still, please.
You can sleep
Safe and sound
Knowing I
Am around
Slip into silent slumber
Sail on a silver mist
Slow Iy and sure lyyoursenses
Will cease to resist
You're snoring.
Sorry.
Trust in me
And just in me
Shut your eyes
And trust in me
Oh, now what?
I'll be right down.
Yes? Yes?
Who is it?
It's me, Shere Khan.
I'd like a word with you
If you don't mind.
Shere Khan.
What a surprise.
Yes, isn't it?
I just dropped by.
Forgive me if I've interrupted anything.
Oh, no, no,
nothing at all.
I thought perhaps you were entertaining
someone up there in your coils.
Coils? Someone?
Oh, no.
I was just curling up
for my siesta.
But you were singing to someone.
Who is it, Kaa?
Uh, who? Oh, no.
Well, I was just singing,
uh, to myself.
Indeed.
Yes. Yes, you see...
I have trouble
with my sinuses.
What a pity.
Oh, you have no idea.
It's simply terrible.
I can't eat.
I can't sleep.
So I sing myself to sleep.
You know, selfhypnosis.
Let me show you
how it works.
Ah, trust in me
No, I can't be bothered with that. I
have no time for that sort of nonsense.
Some other time perhaps?
Perhaps. But at the moment
I am searching for a man cub.
Man cub? What man cub?
The one who's lost.
Now where do you suppose
he could be?
Search me.
That's an excellent idea.
I'm sure you wouldn't mind showing me
your coils, would you, Kaa?
Uh, certainly not.
Nothing here.
And nothing in here.
My sinuses.
Hmm. Indeed.
And now, how about
the middle?
The middle?
Oh, the middle.
Absolutely nothing
in the middle.
Really?
Well, if you do just happen
to see the man cub...
you will inform me first,
understand?
I get the point.
Cross my heart, hope to die.
Good show.
And now I must continue my search
for the helpless little lad.
Ooh, who does he think
he's fooling?
"The helpless little lad."
Ooh, he gives me
the shivers.
Picking on that poor
little helpless boy.
Oh, yes.
Poor little helpless boy.
You told me a lie, Kaa.
You said
I could trust you.
It's like you said.
You can't trust anyone.
If I never see that
skinny little shrimp again...
it will be too soon.
Ooh, my sacroiliac.
Hey, Flaps,
what we gonna do?
I don't know.
What you wanna do?
I've got it! Let's flap over
to the east side of the jungle.
They've always got a bit of action,
a bit of a swingin' scene all right.
Ah, come off it.
Things are right dead all over.
You mean you wish they were.
Very funny.
Okay.
So what we gonna do?
I don't know.
What do you wanna do?
Look, Flaps, first I say,
"What we gonna do?"
Then you say, "I don't know.
What you wanna do?"
Then I say, "What we gonna do?"
You say, "What you wanna do?"
"What we gonna do?" "What you
want__" Let's do something!
Okay. What you wanna do?
Blimey. There you go again.
The same notes again.
I've got it! This time
I've really got it.
So you've got it.
Then what we gonna do?
Hold it, lads. Look.
Look what's coming our way.
Hey, what in the world
is that?
What a crazylooking
bunch of bones.
Yeah, and they're all
walkin' about by themselves.
Yeah.
So what we gonna do?
I don't know.
Hey, now don't
start that again!
Come on, lads. Come on. Let's have
some fun with this little fella...
this little blokey.
Blimey. He's got legs
like a stork, he has.
Like a stork. But he ain't
got no feathers, he ain't.
Go ahead. Laugh.
I don't care.
What's wrong with him?
I think we overdid it.
We were just having a bit
Of fun, that's all.
Oh, just look at him.
Why, the poor little fella.
You know, he must be
down on his luck.
Yeah, or he wouldn't be
in our neighbourhood.
Hey, new kid,
wait a minute! Hey!
Just leave me alone.
Oh, come on. What's wrong?
You know, you look like you
haven't got a friend in the world.
I haven't.
Haven't you got a mother or a father?
No.
Nobody wants me around.
Yeah, we know
how you feel.
Nobody wants us
around either.
Ah, we may look a bit shabby,
but we've got heart.
And feelings too.
And just to prove it to you, we're gonna
let you join our little group.
Kid, we'd like to make you
an honouray vulture.
Thanks, but I__ I'd rather
be on my own, alone.
Aw, now look, kid.
Eveybody's got to have friends.
Hey, fellas,
are we his friends?
We'reyourfriends
We're your friends
We're your friends
to the bitterend
The bitterend
When you're alone
When you're alone
Who comes around
Who comes around
To pluck you up
To pluck you up
Give us a smile.
When you are down
When you are down
And when you're
outside lookin' in
Who's there to open the door
Come on, kid. We need a tenor.
That's what
What friends are for
Who's always eager to extend
A friendly claw
That's what friends are for
And when you're lost
in dire need
Who's at your side
at lightning speed
We're friends with every creature
comin' down the pike
In fact we've never met
an animal we didn't like
Haha. You take it, kid.
Didn't like
So you can see we're friends
We're friends in need
We're friends in need
And friends in need
Friends in need
Are friends indeed
Are friends indeed
Whoop, whoop.
Take it easy, lads.
We'll keep you safe
Steady, steady. Watch it!
In the jungle
Forevermore
That's what friends
Are for
Bravo, bravo.
An extraordinary performance.
And thank you for
detaining my victim.
Uh, dodon't mention it,
Your Highness.
Boo.
Let's get out of here.
Give me room!
Gangway!
Run, friend! Run!
Run? Why should I run?
Why should you run?
Could it be possible that
you don't know who I am?
I know you, all right.
You're Shere Khan.
Precisely.
Then you should also know...
that everyone runs
from Shere Khan.
You don't scare me.
I won't run from anyone.
Ah. You have spirit
for one so small.
And such spirit is deserving
Of a sporting chance.
Now, I'm going to close my eyes
and count to ten.
It makes the chase
more interesting...
for me.
One, two...
three...
four__
You're tying my patience.
Five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten!
Run, Mowgli. Run!
Let go, you big oaf.
Take it easy. Take it__
Whoo! HoHold it, hold it.
Whoa. Slow down. Ooh!
Yow! Whoa! Slow! Easy now.
Ooh. Oh, boy. Easy.
He's got a tiger
by the tail, he has.
And he'd better
hang on too.
Take that, ya big bully.
Let him have it again, kid.
Hit him again, kid. Go on!
Baloo! Help me!
Somebody do somethin'
with that kid.
Come on, lads.
He's safe now.
You can let go, Baloo.
Are you kiddin'?
There's teeth in the other end.
I'll kill you for this.
Let go!
Baloo needs help!
Fire! That's the only thing
old Stripes is afraid of.
You get the fire.
We'll do the rest.
Charge!
You there, punch and blow.
Stay out of this,
you mangy fools.
Yeah, yeah.
Missed me a mile, he did.
Yeah!
Yeah! Pull his blinkin' whiskers.
He's a bloomin' pussycat,
he is.
Look behind you, chum.
Well, that's
the last of him.
Old Stripes took off like
a flaming comet, he did.
Well, come on. Let's go
congratulate our friend.
Hold it, fellas.
Now's not the time for it.
Look.
Baloo?
Baloo, get up.
Oh, please get up.
Mowgli, try to understand.
Bagheera, what's
the matter with him?
You've got to be brave,
like Baloo was.
You__ You don't mean__
Oh, no. Baloo.
Now, now.
I know how you feel.
But you must remember,
Mowgli...
greater love
hath no one...
than he who lays down
his life for his friend.
When great deeds are
remembered in this jungle...
one name will stand
above all others__
our friend, Baloo, the bear.
He's crackin' me up.
The memory of Baloo's...
sacrifice and bravey...
will forever be engraved
on our saddened hearts.
Beautiful.
This spot where Baloo fell...
will always be a hallowed
place in the jungle...
for there lies
one of nature's...
noblest creatures.
I wish my mother
could've heard this.
It's best we leave now.
Come along, man cub.
Hey, don't stop now, Baghee.
You're doin' great!
There's more, lots more.
Why, you big fraud!
You, you, you fourflusher!
II'm fed up, and II__
Baloo! You're all right!
Who, me? Sure I am.
Never felt better.
You sure had us worried.
Ah, I was just takin' five.
You know, playin' it cool.
Yeah, but he was too easy.
Good old Papa Bear.
It's going to be a bit dull without
the little bloke, isn't it?
Yeah. So what we gonna do?
I don't know.
Hey, now, don't start that again!
Hey, Baghee, too bad
you missed the action.
You should have seen how
I made a sucker out of old Stripes
with that left up in his face.
Boom, boom,
I was givin' him. Whang!
You wanna know somethin'?
We're good sparrin' partners.
You'd better believe it.
Yes, sir.
Nothin' or nobody is ever
gonna come between us again.
My own home
My own home
My own home
My own home
Look. What's that?
Oh, it's the man village.
No, no. I mean that.
Forget about those.
They ain't nothin' but trouble.
Just a minute.
I've never seen one before.
So you've seen one.
So let's go.
I'll be right back.
I want a better look.
Mowgli, wait a minute.
Ah, Baloo.
Let him have
a better look.
Father's hunting in the forest
Mother's cooking in the home
I must go to fetch the water
Till the day that I am grown
Till I'm grown
Till I'm grown
I must go to fetch the water
Till the day that I am grown
Then I will have
a handsome husband
And a daughter of my own
And I'll send her
to fetch the water
I'll be cooking in the home
Then I'll send her
to fetch the water
I'll be cooking in my home
She did that on purpose.
Obviously.
Mowgli, come back.
Come back!
Go on! Go on!
He's hooked.
Ah, it was inevitable, Baloo.
The boy couldn't help himself.
It was bound to happen.
Mowgli is where
he belongs now.
Yeah...
I guess you're right.
But I still think he'd
have made one swell bear.
Well, come on,
Baghee buddy.
Let's get back
to where we belong...
and get with the beat.
Look for the bare necessities
The simple bare necessities
Forget about your worries
And your strife
I mean the bare necessities
Are Mother Nature's recipes
That bring the bare
necessities of life
