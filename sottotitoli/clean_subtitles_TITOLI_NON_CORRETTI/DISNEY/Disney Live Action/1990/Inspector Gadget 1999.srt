Help!
See you at
the P.T.A. meeting.
Good morning, Officer Brown.
Morning.
Officer Brown!
How do you do? Morning.
No brakes!
Help, Uncle John!
Somebody help!
Save us!
Help!
Where's Officer Brown?
Help!
Hey, the dog!
The dog!
Oh, Harvey!
Officer Brown,
you're my hero.
Oh, please, Miss.
It was nothing. Oh, geez
All in a day's work, ma'am.
Any cop woulda done the same.
Brain? Yech.
Having another hero cop dream,
Uncle John?
Every time I close my eyes.
How was school?
Fine.
Don't forget, tomorrow's the day parents
come and talk about their careers.
Oh. Well, I might
have to work.
Do you want me to ask off?
Oh, no.
That's okay.
Parents coming to school
Whose idea was that anyway?
But if it's important to you, Penny...
Did the letter come?
Letter?
Uh, gee, well What letter?
I don't... Oh, yes.
They said two years as a security guard
isn't enough experience to be a cop.
Uncle John, I'm sorry.
Me too.
Well, I can still
secure and protect.
I just think I could do
so much more good as a cop.
Hey, wait a minute.
Tomorrow's your day off.
Oh, well...
Look, I know that
Nicole's dad is a lawyer,
and Kim's dad is a dentist,
and I just didn't want to
embarrass you with your friends.
If I only had that badge.
Uncle John, it's not the badge,
it's the heart behind it.
I'm very proud of you.
Fingers crossed.
This chip is gonna make
the whole Gadget project work.
Dad, concentrate.
Try to move the foot.
All right.
Kick the ball.
Nothin'.
I'm hungry.
Okay, all right. I'll go get us some dinner.
But then we keep going.
Yeah. Okay.
I'll call the guardhouse
so they don't search
the deliver guy again.
Hello, Antonio's? Yeah, it's Brenda.
No, foot's still not moving.
Dad, keep thinking
about that foot.
Yep, the usual.
Mmmhmm. Mmmhmm.
Dad.
Hmm? What?
Tap your foot again.
What?
Huh.
That's weird.
Wh... What were you
thinking about?
I was thinking about how much
you remind me of your mother.
Wait a second.
Wait a second!
That's it!
It's animated by will,
not by thought.
By your heart,
not your head!
Come on, try it again.
Do it again! All right.
We did it!
We moved the foot!
Jack, Queen...
Brenda Bradford
She's so beautiful.
Wowser.
Black eight on the red nine...
What?
Oh, oh, nothin'.
I was just talkin'
to myself.
Thelma, how do I look?
Like a geek from Kansas
who became a security guard.
Brenda Bradford.
Well, good evening,
young lady.
It's been a while.
Four, three, two, one, zero.
Go.
Dr. Bradford.
Yes?
Hi.
Hi.
I borrowed a book from your dad.
You did?
Power Learning Through Speed Study.
Oh.
It took me forever
to get through it.
But I really think
it's gonna pay off, though.
I just applied
to the Riverton Police Force.
Yeah?
It's what I've always wanted to do.
Help people, that is.
Um, I gotta...
Dr. Bradford is out
of the lab and we can go in.
Sikes, release the
remotecontrol van.
Nice stars.
Yeah? Which ones?
I just meant the whole...
All of 'em.
Oh, I thought you meant a specific cluster.
I always take everything
so literally.
So do I.
Yeah?
I forgot my keys.
Oh.
I'm Okay.
Sorry.
Good night now.
Nite.
well, I'll just stay here, then,
and, uh, secure the parking lot.
Concentrate, you twit!
Hey, that guy's speeding.
Ten miles an hour
in the parking lot, buddy!
No,no,no,no, straight ahead!
No, left! Bad cat. Bad cat.
Left, Sikes, turn!
What was that?
We have an intruder on the premises.
A black van.
Where?
Try that big hole in the wall!
Brenda.
Huh?
Hello, Artemus.
I'll take that.
Oh, no, wait.
No, no, no, no!
Now, just a moment...
Arrivederci, Professor.
Uhoh!
Someone's gonna blame the old lady.
Sniffy, let's go.
Dr. Bradford, I won't rest until
I find whoever's responsible.
Justice will be served.
Brown, where are you going?
To catch the bad guys!
Stand back, Thelma!
This isn't going to end well.
You're not on duty, Brown!
I'm always on duty!
Oh, no.
We're being chased by the hatchback squad.
Hey,
I have a hatchback.
Ooh. Oh!
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa! Whoa!
Now you've crossed the line.
Pull over, you!
Stop the car, Sikes.
I want to enjoy this.
Oh, gosh! Oh!
Uhoh.
♪ Yahoo ♪
Attention!
Driver of the wrecked limo,
attached
to the Yahoo! Billboard,
this is
security Officer John Brown.
Please step out of the vehicle
immediately...
Or... Else.
Fine work, Mr. Security Guard.
You got me.
Here.
Have a victory cigar.
No, thanks.
Remember, smoking kills.
I don't smoke.
Oh, really?
You will now.
Oh, boy.
My hand!
Pardon me! Excuse me!
Comin' through!
Hey, have you seen
my uncle, John Brown?
Uh, he's in there.
Uncle John?
Please wake up.
I know you can hear me.
Look who I brought to visit.
Look, it's Brain.
He came to see you.
Okay. No.
Not in his mouth, Brain. No. No.
Okay, stop.
We're lookin' at extensive tissue damage,
44 fractures, a major concussion,
all coupled with
extensive internal trauma.
This man tried
to save my father.
He risked his life
to protect our work.
We've done all we can.
Not yet, we haven't.
Mayor's coming through!
Clear the way! Dr. Bradford!
Clear for the mayor!
Dr. Bradford, both I and
police Chief Quimby here...
Hi. Are very sorry to
hear about your father.
He was a good man.
Oh.
Did you know him?
No, I didn't.
So, how soon can you finish
the Gadget Project, hmm?
I'm sure that he would have wanted
me to finish it as soon as possible.
Mmm. Oh. Yeah.
With the, uh, "English patient" there?
That's enough, Quimby.
Oh, sorry. Just doesn't look like
you got off to a good start there.
So, how can you be so sure that
this is the proper subject?
Dad told me that I would know
when the right man came along.
John Brown's the right man.
Well.
Well.
That's good enough
for me.
Let's go.
Hmm.
Chain saw! Waxy buildup, stat.
Bring in the hoses, stat!
Ready, and...
Break!
It's a thing of beauty,
Quimby.
The future of law enforcement
reborn before our very eyes.
Yeah. Columbo and Nintendo
all rolled into one.
He'll make you obsolete,
no overtime, no hazard pay,
no blue flu.
And he won't call me
"evil gidget" behind my back.
Oh, by the way, what do we have on
the Artemus Bradford murder, hmm?
Well, we got a limo
with no license,
and some scrap metal from whatever
it was that broke into the lab.
Do we at least know
what was stolen?
According, to Doctor Bradford,
a robotic foot.
Robotic foot.
A robotic foot?
Yeah.
What kind of cyberfreak
are we dealing with?
Not bad, Kramer.
Not bad at all.
It's got a sort of postmodern
Captain Hook kind of feel to it.
Very diabolical.
I deserve
a dashing appellation.
"Dashing Appalachian"? What is that?
A hillbilly with a tuxedo?
No, you idiot!
No!
It's a nickname
One that will send my
enemies cowering in fear.
Ah.
Ah, too bad
"Hook" is taken, huh?
How 'bout... "Captain Claw"?
Oh.
No, no, no, no, no...
Or "Santa Claw."
Just "Claw."
One word,
like "Madonna."
Well, anyhoo, Captain...
Sir... Mr. Claw,
I know how much you like to
maintain an active lifestyle,
so I have managed to design
a few interchangeable options.
Hi, hi.
Oh, very clever, Kramer.
"Very clever, Kramer."
Very clever, indeed.
Well, first we have
the opera hand,
for those special nights out.
And I know how much
you enjoy Japanese food,
so I made you a sushi hand
See there?
Tasty.
Hmm.
Also, I don't remember if you
enjoy the medieval fare, but...
Kramer, that's enough.
Sikes, bring on the foot.
Oops.
Hmm?
What the...
What have they got me on?
Ooh! Ooh!
Oh, my Oh!
Ooh!
I, um...
Your thumb's on fire!
I seem to be having
a reaction.
Mr. Brown.
Oh. Oh, it's you.
It's all right.
It's all right.
Um, I, uh...
I don't know what's wrong.
I, uh I seem to be ill,
and I can't remember anything.
You may not remember
very much right now.
You suffered a pretty major
concussion in the explosion.
What happened?
You've just come out of
a very long recovery.
You are now a sophisticated network
of tissue, hardware and software.
No!
I gotta get outta here.
Mr. Brown...
Mr. Brown, come back here.
We're gonna go in
I'll take...
Look, Mr. Brown, I know
that this is all new for you,
and it must feel strange.
You will adjust.
My head is very heavy.
Don't worry. That's easy to fix.
I don't
wanna be like this.
I don't understand
what happened to me.
John, we saved your life.
I'm not me anymore.
I'm a hardware store.
This is a huge opportunity.
You were designed
as the first prototype
cyber police officer for the
Riverton Police Department.
You said yourself you wanted to
help people This is your chance.
I do want to help people.
I know.
Aiyee!
Oh!
I'll be with you
every step of the way.
Okay. I'd shake your hand
but you might lose an eye.
An android of this quality
could have a myriad of uses:
shock troops,
kamikaze pilots, hit men.
International rescue workers,
teachers.
Oh, yes. I was getting to them.
Well, let's see him in action, huh?
Okay.
Oh, I'll strap myself in.
Okay.
Turn me on, Kramer.
Move, darn you!
Move!
It's a lemon.
Thank you for that, Sikes.
You put it on. Come on.
Why can't he do it?
He's capable of intelligent thought.
That's useful to me.
Now, strap you in.
Perhaps if we give
him maximum voltage.
Yeah, that might work.
I want my...
Mama!
Something got left behind.
What does Brenda have
that I don't?
Now this is the single most important
component, the neuron synapse amplifier.
It's a highpowered
processor chip...
That increases the charge
in the human brain wave,
enough to move the machinery
that's now built into your body.
Without this chip The most powerful
robotics chip in the world
Your body couldn't
possibly function.
Any more questions?
Nope, I'm fine.
Guess it just takes a little getting used to,
you know?
Good. Then I will just give
you your manual to study.
Volume one.
Mmmhmm.
Looks like the usual stuff,
extendolegs,
helicopter hat.
Guess I'm all set then.
Right. Oh!
There's one more thing.
I almost forgot.
It's important.
Your new wardrobe.
The Gadget suit.
Okay, so if you want to
operate one of your gadgets,
you simply say "Gogo gadget,"
and then you name the device.
Well, couldn't I say something more official,
like...
Like,
"In the name of justice."
Well, you could,
but it wouldn't work.
But "Gogo gadget,"
sounds so
My father designed
the program, and he...
Oh! Oh, oh, oh,oh!
It's "Gogo gadget."
I really like it.
Okay.
Good. I'm glad.
So, okay, let's say there are two
guys trying to rob a jewelry store,
and you wanted to trip
'em up What would you do?
Okay, uh, let me think.
Gogo gadget
oil slick.
That's not oil,
it's toothpaste!
Ooh! Ooh!
Stop it!
Whoa!
Say, "Gogo gadget, stop"!
Gogo, stop!
We're gonna need some more work with you.
Try to visualize your goal.
Concentrate.
Put all other things
out of your head except
obtaining the balls.
Okay.
He's just like
the, "Six Million Dollar Man."
What?
Ungrip! Ungrip!
Turn it off!
Well, I guess $6,000,000
doesn't buy what it used to.
Excuse me.
He is not a man, you know.
He is a monster.
I've got something special
to show you. Tada!
The Gadgetmobile.
Wow.
It's for you.
I made it myself.
Come on.
You made me a car?
The only thing anybody's ever
made me before is a sweater.
All right.
Now, it may look simple,
but this thing has just about as
many factory extras as you do.
Come on!
Get in there!
Oh.
Watch the coat.
Okay.
Gosh, she's incredible.
Oh, it's a he.
excuse me?
You'll see.
Okay, now, it has voice activation,
ejection seats,
a powerassisted metamorphic camouflage
system, a cardiohoming device.
then there's a periscope,
a candy...
Dr. Bradford,
there's something I just have to ask you.
Oh, just say,
"Gogo Gadgetmobile."
Yes, but will you...
"Gogo Gadgetmobile?"
Good morning, Riverton!
Hey! Who's in the car?
I work alone.
Hey, before we hit the road,
I gotta tell you somethin'.
Duck!
I don't think
the car likes me.
Who you callin' "car"?
I'm a crimefighting machine.
Watch this. Left turn!
Haven't you fallen out yet?
No, sir, I haven't!
Who are you, rookie?
I'm Officer John Brown,
and you're exceeding
the speed limit.
Speed limits are for cars,
not the Gadgetmobile.
Are you...
Are you talking to me?
Speakin' of the law, who's
not wearing a seat belt?
Gotta wear the belt, baby!
Hey!
It's a Disney movie.
Now, I'm gonna fight me some crime. Whoo!
More left turns!
Could you slow down, please?
I... I get carsick.
You know what makes
me peoplesick?
A rookie thinkin'
he's good enough for Dr. B.
Not that it's your business,
but what makes you think I was
putting moves
on Dr. Bradford?
Hey, I've got heat sensors.
I know what you were thinkin'
when Dr. B. gave
you that smile.
Now, look here. Come clean with me,
or I'm gonna bounce you right outta here.
I can assure you my only interest
in Dr. Bradford is professional.
"Professional," huh?
Well, good.
Keep it that way, and that's an order.
You got it?
Uh, I'm the inspector, you're the car.
I'll tell you what you are.
You're the...
Don't make me go,
"De La Hoya" on you!
Isn't there an "off" button
or something? A "mute"?
Oh!
Sorry, sir!
Don't push my buttons
without readin' the manual!
Ooh, watch out there, now.
Whoa!
Hmm? Aw, man.
I got a june bug in my grille.
Shouldn't we be working
together, helping people?
Why didn't you say so?
Yo, Clouseau, 9 o'clock.
Left, you idiot!
Over the lock!
Shut up and let me do it.
Please. Thank you.
Very observant,
Gadgetmobile.
Time to do some good.
Lost your keys, fellas?
Uh, keys Yeah, keys.
Allow me to help.
Ugh. Say,
"Bye bye" to the rookie.
Here.
This ought to do it.
Oh. Thanks.
Yo! Check out
the bowling shirt!
Huh. I'm a bowler myself.
You work at the prison?
Uh, yeah. Work at the prison.
Psst! Gadget!
I'll be getting into the law
enforcement bowling league too.
There you are. Drive carefully.
We'll see you.
That's it. I can't take it anymore.
Step away from the Viper!
Hey, what's the big idea?
Open your eyes! we got
a couple of jailbreakers!
Well, then, we should inform the
prison guar... Wait a minute!
Let's split up.
I'll go after 'em, and you say, "104"
Gogo gadget coils!
Skates!
I meant skates!
Come here, Carl Lewis.
Uh, halt! Forward!
Oh, for cryin' out loud.
Gogo forward, please!
Oh, for Pete's sake!
Halt!
Hello.
Sit back and enjoy the bars.
You'll be lookin' at 'em
for the next 20 years.
oh! Ooh!
Uhoh. Oh, gosh!
Ooh!
Gogo gadget
Grappling hook!
Whoa!
Wowser!
The Riverton Police Department
has a new cop on the beat.
Here's Tira with the story.
In an incredible display
of courage,
Riverton's first cybercrimefighter
heroically apprehended,
two escaped convicts this
afternoon in the downtown area.
The soon to be inspector will be inducted
into the Riverton Police Department,
at a gala event
tomorrow night
Why, it's that annoying little
security guard from the institute.
...Riverton's much admired
budget surplus to fund
So he's the lucky duck they
plucked for the Gadget Program.
Ha! Irony abounds.
That's my cruller!
Gimme that!
Sikes!
Yes, boss?
Get my tuxedo ready.
Tomorrow promises to be quite an evening.
So, anyone special
going tonight?
Well, the mayor,
the governor.
Any doctors?
Doctors?
You know, female doctors
Very attractive
female doctors.
Wowser.
Is it that obvious?
Come on, Uncle John.
You just need to...
Loosen up, be cool.
You been talking to my car?
What?
Huh. You'll see.
Fire!
Wrong finger.
Careful.
Excuse me. Inspector,
may I have this dance?
Oh. Why, sure.
Yeah. You betcha.
Uh, here.
Let's see if I still
know how to do this.
Not bad, John Brown.
May I cut in?
Hello. Sanford Scolex.
We were at Harvard together.
We were? Oh, you don't recognize me.
That's because I've changed.
I was obese.
Maybe you remember me better
like this.
Yes!
Wow!
Well, it's nice
to see you again.
Here you go.
You look...
Different.
Well, I'll go get us
some champagne.
Oh, great idea!
Three flutes of bubbly, please, Mr. Gizmo.
We'll be right here.
You know, Brenda...
I'm not at all surprised you
became such a renowned scientist.
You were always the most
brilliant one in school.
No, I...
I was a hard worker.
Oh, I remember.
I used to watch the way you wrinkled your
little nose, concentrating on calculations.
You did? Mmm.
You took my breath away.
I did.
Brenda, dance with me.
You remind me of a thing
Godzilla once said.
Tell me, what will you do now that
the Gadget Program is completed?
Ooh. Oh.
Huh?
You're done with
the Gadget thing.
Come and join me
at Scolex Industries.
We'll be right here.
Ahem.
I could only carry
two glasses.
Oh.
A bientot, ma cherie
Ah!
John...
He just offered me a job.
He said that I would have
unlimited funding,
my own lab...
And complete control
of all my research.
But what about
your other research?
The Gadget Program.
Are you sure you've
worked out all the bugs?
Well, um...
Oh, how touching.
The creator and the creation.
Excuse me, Inspector,
but the press would like to take some
photos of us with our boys in blue.
Let's go.
photo op.
Okay. Come on.
get ready, boys. Here's the dynamic duo.
The camera is your friend.
Watch the birdie!
Get a big smile!
Chief, if you don't mind
my asking,
when do I get started
on my big case?
Oh, soon enough, Gadget.
I have a few assignments for
you to cut your teeth on first.
Big grin. That's it.
Inspector! Over here, please!
I've got to talk to the chief.
The trouble is he's not taking me seriously.
Oh, boohoo hoo, rookie.
Nobody likes a whiner.
Now, what are you gonna do about it?
I'm ready to get tough
Real tough.
Here comes Gadget.
Hey, that your new partner,
Gadget?
What you got, a cat burglar?
A real felon, huh?
the city's safe now.
Cat got your tongue?
Inspector Gadget reporting,
sir, with the 13th...
That's a baker's dozen...
Kitten I've pulled out of a tree this week.
So?
Permission to speak freely, sir.
No.
Well, if you're gonna pout.
Thank you, sir.
What I want to say is that,
while I appreciate cute and fluffy
as much as the next officer,
I fear that the kitten rescue patrol
is a misuse of my capabilities.
Huh.
You know, I don't get it, Gadget.
Every time you
I won't be happy until I've brought the
murderers of Artemus Bradford to justice.
Ah.
And I won't be happy
until you're off the force,
and being sold, piece by piece,
at some garage sale.
I want that case, sir.
Well, I'll tell you, the problem is the
Bradford case requires real police work
and the fact is, you're not
a real police inspector.
You are not a real policeman. You are just a
publicity stunt that we have to put up with.
So...
Why don't you just aboutface
and get out of my office.
Okiedokles, sir.
I've pretty much completed
Prometheus per your specifications,
and, I must say,
the likeness is really quite convincing.
Good. Imitation is the sincerest
form of flattery, Kramer.
Isn't that Dr. Brenda
Bradford's Private data?
Oh, yes.
I tapped into her files
and stole her research.
Why would you do that?
"Why would you do that?
Why would you do that?"
Ah.
Oh, oh.
Kramer, don't look
so nonplussed.
Now that Dr. Bradford is part of the
Scolex team, we share everything,
or at least we will.
Oh, well, I think sharing files is a
great way to bring the company together.
You know, make sure we're all singing
off the same song sheet, so to speak.
Imagine my relief
to have your support.
Anyway, sir, like I said,
without the chip, I don't think...
Oh, so you made the chip.
Hey, that looks just like
the guy we almost killed.
Oh, I didn't hear that!
Chips ahoy.
Wow!
Oh, sweet lordy.
Good morning, Robogadget.
You have just been animated,
by the most complex computer
technology in the world.
What are you going
to do now?
I'm gonna kick some butt.
Very saucy.
It looks so real.
Yow!
Oh!
Very good, yes!
Oh, Robo, nothing
can stop us now!
Gotta make my own case.

Hello. Finally, there's
a detective in the house.
Wait a minute. If Scolex stole the foot,
then Scolex murdered Dr...
Oh, no! Brenda!

Inspector Gadget apparently has gone
berserk in the downtown Riverton area.
Eyewitnesses told me
that he was laughing
while he maliciously stacked these four cars.
What's gone wrong?
Other reports indicate that he's already
caused a major traffic accident,
destroyed private property and set
fire to an elderly man's beard.

What happened?
I'll go get Scolex.
Maybe he can help.

he's not a very good guy.
Go home!

I owe you one, Scolex.
Oh?
You blew up me
and my Chevette,
and I really liked that car.
Well, you crushed my hand,
and I really liked that hand,
so, go, go
get over it.
I don't know what
you're up to, Scolex,
but you'll
never get away with it.
Oh, how cliché, Inspector.
I think somebody's been watching
too many Saturday morning cartoons.
Hmm?
Huh?
Huh?
Unfortunately, Gadget,
in the real world...
Evil quite often prevails.
I'm afraid so.
Pull him up.
Now, look how your replacement
is helping people...
To cross the street.
Hey.
He looks just like me.
I don't get it.
Why would you do this?
To make teachers!
Shut up!
Oh.
I'll tell you why.
To make technowarriors
that never get tired,
never get hungry...
And never say "no."
Every army in the world will
be made up of my creations.
Imagine the confusion,
Gadget, huh?
Imagine the perks.
Comprende?
Yeah, I comprende.
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.
I comprendo.
Yo comprendo.
Conjugate the verb, for pity's sake.
Oh.
Pull the N.S.A. chip before
he butchers another language.
You're kidding, right?
Okay. You see?
He's always kidding.
I never know.
This time no.
I want to make sure nobody else
can develop their own android.
Do it,
or you'll be building yourself a new head.
Oh.
"New head."
Okay, I am not here
right now.
I am on the beach with dolphins,
and, oh, hi, look at this starfish.
I don't feel so good.
I'm sorry, Gadget.
Good help is so hard to find these days.
Would you mind
if I do the honors, hmm?
Well, here goes.
Arrivederci. Ciao, ciao.
Goodbye, Mr. Chip.
Dump this idiot
in the junkyard.
Yes, boss.
Oh, no, not that idiot.
This one.
Oh, I wish you'd be
more specific.
There's an awful lot
of idiots around here.
Attention, Robogadget.
Destroy the city
and have some fun.
Okay, boss.
You with the beard, come here.
Hello? John?
Anybody home?
You sit back and enjoy the ride, Penny.
I'm driving.
Hey, remember, kids. I'm a professional car,
so don't try this at home.
Penny, where's your uncle?
I thought he was with you.
This is bad.
Come on, Penny.
We gotta find him.
There's something
rotten in Riverton.
Where you going, Gadget?
The chief is very upset with you.
I'm gonna
have to arrest you. Hey!
Get your hands off me!
Officer down!
Strike!
Next time you pay for a gadget,
don't forget the extended warranty.
What?
Let's talk, chief.
Sure. What do you What do you
want to talk about? Politics?
The Florida Marlins?
II know you're upset
about yesterday.
That was the job talking.
The truth is...
I want you I want you
on the Bradford case.
In fact, I... I want you
to lead the Bradford case.
I think...
Freeze!
Hold it right there!
Shoot him!
Adios, boys!

What would
Uncle John be doing here?
I mean...
Are you sure we picked up
the right signal?
Of course,
I have the right signal.
You know I have lojack
on my father's side.
Uhoh, I don't like this.

He can do it all by himself.
Hmm?
Can't be.
John?
Uncle John?
John, can you hear us?
He's alive.
Brenda.
Penny?
You're alive.
It's a miracle.
He doesn't need the chip.
It's my Uncle John,
that's what it is.
Whoa.
Way to go, rookie.
We'll make a cop
out of you yet.
Buckle up, kids,
and stick some newspaper under that beagle.
This engine's only got two speeds,
"Fast" and "Whoo, what was that?"
Where's Scolex?
I'll find him. You drive.
Let's see what you can do,
Gadgetmobile, 'cause I feel the need...
The need for speed.
Now, if I'm home late,
it just means it took a little extra time
to overthrow Scolex's
evil empire, okay?
Okay!
Later, Penny.
Left turn!
Right turn!
Where'd they go?
Heads up, baby!
Evil dude's limo at 12:00.
Left turn!
Got it!
Okay, take the wheel.
Right!
When I give you the signal, slow down.
Okay!
Okay. Whoo!
Now!
Gotcha!
Nice aim, doc!
Thank you.
You're under arrest for the murder
of Artemus Bradford, Scolex.
God, you're irritating.
And you...
You're under arrest for
impersonating a police officer.
Oh, what a tangled web
we weave
Get rid of him.
You just ran a stop sign.
Whoa!
Hot, hot, hot, hot.
Hot foot. Hot, hot, hot.
Oh, whoo!

I'll go get him, boss.
Sit tight.
Watch out behind you!
We're gonna have some fun.
I'm gonna make you
into a compact.
Whoo!
Time for a bat turn.
Don't lose that limo!
On the case, doc!
You know how to dance,
don't you?
Actually, I was taking lessons
not long ago, in the hope...
Shut up and dance!
That one day I...

You know, I love it
when you call me "Claw."
So what's new?
Hello... You killed my father!
Time.
Gadget here.
It's about Brenda, partner.
Yeah?
Scolex is taking her to the roof.
I'd save her, but I can't
fit in the elevator.
I'm on my way.
You know what they say about
nice guys finishing last?
Huh?
Well, they were wrong.
Gogo gadget

What happened to you?
Let me put it this way.
I got the skittles

I'll be right back.
Oh. Penny, why are you here?
Evidence!
Hey, Gadget.
It's a clipon.
Whoa!
Okay, Brain. No, no, no,
Brain, you go that way.
I'll go this way.
I gotta destroy the evidence.
Why couldn't it be a finger?
I could be working
at my dad's store right now...
Selling nails, hammers
and power drills.
Yes!
Power drills rock!
Get in there!
Well, who are you?
Whoa, there, big boy.
Um, hi, there.
Hello.
Why's that foot
in the toilet?
I was, uh,
I was cleaning it.
So what's your name?
Uh, I'm Sikes.
You know, Sikes, you look more like
the kind of guy who should be, um...
Uh...
Helping someone pick out
good weather stripping.
My old man had
a hardware store.
Telephone!
It's mine.
Hello?
Hi, Mr. Gadget.
Nicole and Kim, how'd you get
the number of my hand?
From Penny.
Is she there?
Penny isn't here right now,
but you can call her at home, okay?
She's not home, but we'll try her again.
Okay, bye.
Bye. What do they mean,
she's not at home?
Whee, whee!
Oh! Oh, no!
Oh, oh, oh! Oh, oh!
I don't get it, Claw.
What's your plan now?
Since my dreams for
a global robotic empire...
Mongrel! My pants!
Oh, God!
Mongrel.
Next thing you know...
Next thing you know,
you're a minion.
You're a minion.
I'm a minion.
Ooh! Oh!
Ow, ow!
Uncle.
Hey, hey, don't touch that.
Hey. Hey,
what'd you do that for?
We shouldn't be fighting.
We've got a lot in common,
except I've got nicer teeth.
I'd hoped that we could've worked together,
been partners.
Together, you and I could've
ruled the world.
You should've quit
while you were ahead.
Cannonball!
Ooh! Ooh la la!

Whoa! Whoa! whoa!

Oh, bad, bad, bad.

Sit back and relax, darling.
Whoa!
Hey!
I can see my house from here.
Whoa!
Two things, Scolex!
One, you are
completely insane.
And two,
I liked you better fat.
Bring on the brownies!
Ha!
Wheel in the waffles!
I'm ready to binge!
Darn! That fellow
will not give us a break!
For the third time
Sanford Scolex,
you are under arrest!
No!
Go, go, go, go, go, go,
Gadget!
John!
Oh, no!
Let me give you a lift.
Where can I drop you off?
I'd answer, but I doubt
you really care.
John! I'm up here!
Take my hand!
Hi, John. How are you
doing down there?
John!
"John!"
John, I know you can save us!
Think of something!
I'm working on it.
Hurry!
Try to visualize your goal.
Back to the drawing board!
Brenda, jump!
Right on my back!
Oh, Brenda, don't jump. For god's sake,

John, you did it.
You saved our lives.
I did? I guess I did.
Wowser!
Just watch out for the big head.
Understood.
You know, arrogance can sneak up on you.
No, that big head!
Oh, no.
John!
Are you okay?
Gadget.
Oh, hello, Brenda.
Are you breathing?
I think so.
How's your central vallecular
equilibrator feeling?
It feels pretty good.
And how's your autoaxle
lubricator functioning?
It's functioning fully.
Oh, Gadget.
What is it?
Is my occipital piston
slipping?
No.
I just never realized
what beautiful brown eyes
you have.
It's a highfly Scolex.
The Gadgetmobile
pulls under it.
The crowd's going crazy.
He makes the catch!
We made it!
Ladies and gentlemen, Scolex
is out and that is the game!
Final score, Gadgetmobile one,
Scolex zippo.
And the fans rush the field.
No autographs, please.
Please, y'all, come on, now.
Freeze! Get back!
Gentlemen, there's been
some kind of a mistake.
Chief!
Oh, sorry, kiddo.
I'm gonna have to place
your uncle under arrest.
Freeze!
Don't move, Gadget!
Well, I just thought you'd
wanna know That Sanford Scolex
created an evil version of my
uncle to terrorize Riverton.
Is that true?
Every word of it.
She's an amazing young woman.
She held up a mirror to my misguided
ways in the service of Mr. Scolex.
I'm sorry, Chief.
Here's the foot.
I didn't know any better.
Et tu, Sikes?
Cover him, men!
They're all yours, fellas.
Wowser.
Excuse me!
Press!
Excuse me!
Mayor on the premises.
The shepherd needs her sheep.
Yes, it is a credit to myself
and my administration,
that we had the courage to believe
in and initiate the gadget program.
Arrivederci, Gadget!
This is not goodbye.
I'll get you next
time, Gadget.
I'll get you.
Wowser.
A happy ending.
What could be
better than true love?
Ooh, cute little bug.
Wait up, Fraeulein.
Did you know I speak German?
Fahrvergnugen, baby.
