Ooh, It's So Pretty.
Yeah.
Let's Go Look.
God?
Are You Home?
Dean!
Well, Dad Always Says
It's God's House.
Let's Go Look Around.
Okay.
I Wonder What's Up There.
You Better Get Down. You're
Gonna Get In Trouble. Dean!
Okay. Yeow!
Whoa! Whoa!
Help!
Dean!
Help! Somebody Help Me!
Help Me! Rose!
That Sounds Like Your Husband, Mrs. Rafferty.
Help! Where Are You?
That's Delaney, All Right.
Now What Is He Up To?
Help! Help!
Hey, That's Someone In Trouble.
What Did You Do?
Nothing.
Gangway!
Delaney, What Are You
Doing Up There?
You're Supposed
To Be Painting.
Rose, Now, Don't Start.
Don't You Yell At Me.
Don't Jump, Mr. Rafferty.
You've Got Lots To Live For.
You Think
I Don't Know That?
Why Doesn't Somebody
Get A Ladder?
There's One Out Back. Okay, Come On.
I'll Give You A Hand.
You Can Stop
Your Hollering, Delaney.
They're Coming For You.
Hurry, Hurry.
Me Hands Are__
Has Anybody Called
The Fire Department?
There's A Phone In The Office.
Gangway!
Come On! Come On!
Hang On.
We Got The Ladder.
Hang On!
It's Coming Up.
Stop Kicking Around! You'll Tire Yourself Out!
It's Too Short.
Maybe We Should Take The Ladder Up To
The Belfry And Lower It Down To Him.
Hey, That's A Good Idea.
Yeah, Do That.
Take That Down.
Everybody, Push.
Where Are You Going Now?
Well, Can't You Get The Cat
Out Of The Tree Later?
Well, A Man's Life
Is In Danger.
Forward! Forward!
Go Back. Back Up.
It's The North Avenue
Presbyterian Church.
Hurry! Hurry!
That's The Way
To Go.
Honey!
Go Back! Go Back!
Hold On!
They're Coming!
Hold On!
Somebody, Get Around. 
Move It! Hurry Up, You Two
Sorry.
Sorry.
Ouch.
Sorry.
Ow!
Sorry.
That Ain't Gonna Make
Much Of A Cushion.
Hey, You With The Flowered Shirt.
Could You Just Take The End There?
Sure.
Hang On, Delaney!
Grab On To The Ladder,
Mr. Rafferty.
Pull Me Up.
Okay.
Ready? Pull.
Oh, I Can't Look. I Can't Look.
Help! Somebody Help!
Delaney! Delaney!
Grab On
To The Ladder!
Help, Somebody!
The Other Side.
The Other Side.
Rose, The Will Is
In The Top Drawer!
Is He All Right? 
Is He All Right? Can You See Anything?
Rosie! Rosie!
Delaney! Delaney!
Me Poor Darlin'! Are You All Right?
Thanks To You,
Rosie, Me Darlin'.
Ah!
Don't Touch Me.
You're A Mess.
Where's Dad?
Dad!
Dad, Are You All Right?
Dad!
Are You All Right?
Who's He?
I'm Reverend Hill,
Your New Pastor.
Oh, He's
The New Pastor.
Glory Be!
It's The New Pastor.
I Hope You Were Praying For Me When I Was Up There.
Welcome To New Campton,
Reverend. I'm Cleo Jackson.
I Hope He Feels All Right.
Look, We Tried To Be On Time.
It Was Just An Awful Mistake.
The Whole Thing, From Start To Finish.
I Volunteer Voluntarily,
Except I Have
BabySitting Problems.
Would You Please Let Him Get His
Hat Off Before You Start That?
Reverend Hill,
I'm Claire Porter.
How Do You Do?
Well, You Know,
We Didn't Expect You Till Tomorrow.
We Would've Had A Less Hectic
Reception If We'd Known.
Would You Happen To Have A Little Of That
Sacramental Wine On The Premises, Reverend
Sacramental. Watch Your Hands.
You Wanna Get Paint All Over The Reverend's Chair?
Haven't You Done Enough
For One Day?
Please, Let's Go Home
And Get You Cleaned Up.
Rosie, You're
Straining Me Patience.
Oh, I'll Strain More Than That.
Isn't This Nice?
Very... Nice.
Oh, That Must Be Howard.
Howard?
My Fiance.
I Told Him I'd Be Waiting For Him Out Front.
IfIfIf You Get A Chance,
Please Check Your Calendar,
Because We're Getting Married June 25,
And We'd Like You To Perform The Ceremony.
Oh, Thank You. That's__
It's Really Been__ Oh, Sorry.
It's Really Been A Pleasure Meeting You. Bye.
Bye.
I Have To Dash Too. It's Been Terribly Nice.
I Have To Pick Up My Children...
And I Have To Get
My Dog Bruno Out Of The Vet.
They Charge An Extra Day If I
Leave Him In There After 4:00.
He Was, Uh,
Foaming At The Mouth.
Well, Saint Bernards Do. But, Uh,
It Was Quite An Excessive Amount.
I Think It Was Just An Oral Problem.
Nothing Rabid. Well, GoodBye.
My, You're A Tall One. 
Come On, Claire.
I Do Believe Our Dear Reverend Has A Lot To Do
And Can Use The Time. See You Later, Annie.
Have A Nice Day.
Come On, Darlin'.
You'll See Him Another Day.
You'll See Him In Church.
GoodBye.
GoodBye.
Quite A Group.
Yes, They Are.
Oh. Oh, I'mI'm Anne Woods.
How Do You Do?
Here's The List
Of The Church Membership.
Minutes Of The Meetings
For The Last Couple Of Months.
That's My Office Right Out There.
If You Have Any Questions__
Unless, Of Course,
You Have Plans To Hire A New Secretary.
No, No.
I Feel Very Fortunate To Have You Stay On.
Oh, Well, Then, In Case__
Here Is...
The Key
To The Outside Door.
Um, These Are The, Uh,
Presbyterian Financial Reports,
The Sinking Fund,
Which Is Emergency Money,
Um,
The Men's Club Book And, Uh__
Is Anything
The Matter?
It's Very Difficult
For Me...
Having A Stranger Take Over
At North Avenue.
But, Miss Woods, You Must Understand
That I Didn't Ask Your Father To Retire.
Oh, I Know.
I Only Applied For The Job.
Of Course I Know That.
It__ It's Just That...
This Church Was Our__
Was His Life.
Yes, There's, Uh__
There's Plenty
Of Evidence Of That.
Either You Or Reverend Woods
Chaired Most Of The Committees.
Someone Had To Do It.
Yes.
But I Think Active Participation
By The Whole Membership...
Is What Really Makes
A Strong Church.
In Fact, I've Got A Lot Of Plans
Along Those Lines For This Church.
I Think You'll Find If You Want Something Done Here...
That It's Easier
To Do It Yourself.
Then That Way, You'll Know
When It Gets Done.
Oh, I'm Sure There Are A Lot Of People
Who Would Like To Help, Given The Chance.
Good Luck.
Oh! Pardon Me, Reverend.
Delaney Left His Hat.
Oh, Here It Is.
Ah, I'mI'm Sorry.
Very Sorry.
Ah, Excuse Me, Mrs.__
Oh. Rafferty.
Mrs. Rafferty.
I Wonder If You Could Help Me With Something.
Help? You? Me?
Oh, Why, Anything.
Anything I Can Do. Anything.
How Would You Like To Be
In Charge Of The, Uh__
The Church Sinking Fund.
In Charge?
Uh__ Uh, Reverend Hill.
Oh, I'd Like It.
In Fact, I'd Love It.
There You Are, Madam Chairman.
And We Thank You.
Thank You.
Uh, Mrs. Rafferty?
Yeah?
Start Thinking About Ways
Of Building Up The Fund.
Of Course I Will. Sure.
Why Not? Why, Uh, GoodBye.
It's, Uh,
All In The Wrist.
Â™ª Oh, How Our Hearts â™ª
â™ª Beat High With Joy â™ª
â™ª When E'er We Hear â™ª

Â™ª Both Friend And Foe â™ª
â™ª In All Our Strife â™ª
â™ª And Preach Thee Too â™ª
â™ª As Love Knows How â™ª

â™ª And Glorious Life â™ª
â™ª Faith Of Our Fathers â™ª
â™ª Amen â™ª
Amen. Amen. Oh.
Oh! Reverend Hill,
I Gotta Talk To You.
Certainly, Mrs. Rafferty.
Why Don't You Drop By After Services?
Oh, It'll Be Too Late Then.
The Third Goes Off In Ten Minutes.
The Third What? After You Put Me In
Charge Of The Church's Sinking Fund__
â™ª Amen â™ª
You Know, The Different Ways To Make
Money For The Church? You Remember.
I Remember, Mrs.
Rafferty, But I Can't Discuss It Now. Excuse Me.
He Bet It On A 71 Shot
He Says Is Wired.
He What?
Delaney Bet It All On Sundae Treat
To Win In The Third At Aqueduct.
Your Husband
Put It All On__
Your Husband Bet
The Whole $1,206...
On A Horse Race?
How Could He Do
Such A Thing?
He__ Well__ Well__
Where Did He Make The Bet?
One Of The Bookies Downtown.
Come With Me.
Â™ª A__ â™ª
Jephthah, The Soldier,
Was A Man Of Mighty Valor.
And We Would All Do Very Well To Follow His Example.
Let Us Pray.
We Thank Thee, O Lord,
For All Thy Bounties.
Amen.
Amen?
Well, You Sure Won't Fall Asleep
During One Of His Sermons.
Reverend, What
Are You Gonna Do?
Stop That Bet.
We'll Take The Bike.
It's Faster. Here. Put That On.
Yes, Sir.
Get On, Mrs. Rafferty.
All Right,
I'm Getting On.
You All Set?
I Think So. Ah!
What's Going On?
Where Is This Bookie?
I Don't Know
Which One He Used.
There's More Than One?
Lots. Carlucci's Bakery,
The Pet Store On Friar...
And The Orthopedic
Shoe Store.
Ortho__
But I'll Lay You 81
He Used Harry, The Hat.
Harry, The Hat?
Right.
Mrs. Rafferty, Hang On!
Pull In Right Here.
There's Harry's Place.
Harry? It Says Sam.
Are You Sure?
I'm Sure. You Better Hurry.
It's Almost Post Time.
Throw 'Em
On The Back Of The Chair.
Are You Harry?
Nope. Sam.
Sam. I Knew It.
What Harry
Did You Want?
Harry. The Hat.
UhHuh. In The Back.
Hold It. Your Pants.
What?
Pants Pressed While You Wait.
It's Part Of My Deal With Harry.
Well, All I Wanna Do Is Talk To Him.
No Exceptions.
Get 'Em Off.
Ridiculous. I Have
To Take My Pants Off.
Here You Are.
Ah, Better Pay Now While You Still Got The 50 Cents.
Yeah.
In The Pants.
Oh, Yeah.
Oh, You Didn't Get A Vision Or Anything,
Did You, Padre?
Which One Is Harry?
Harry. Oh, That's
Harry Right There.
Uh, Harry.
Oh, Don't Worry, Father.
All Our Players Enjoy Complete Anonymity.
It's Reverend.
And I'm Not Concerned About Anonymity.
I'm Concerned About $1,206
Of Our Church's Money...
That A Parishioner
Bet, Here.
So That's Where Delaney
Got That Kind Of Dough.
And You
Want It Back, Right?
Right.
Look, Father,
My Advice Is Let It Ride.
Sundae Treat's
The Horse To Beat.
And At 71,
You'd Really Hate Yourself If She Comes In, Right?
All I Want Is
To Get The Money Back.
The Horses Are At The Post.
And They're Off!
It's Sundae Treat,
Our Travis, Bengal Boy,
Sony, Miss Snoop,
Bags, Rags And Ready Teddy.
It's Sundae Treat, Our Travis,
Bengal Boy Moving On The Outside.
Bengal Boy!
Come On, Bengal Boy!
It's Sundae Treat,
Bengal Boy.
Come On, Sundae Treat!
Sundae Treat.
That's My Horse.
Come On, Sundae Treat!
Come On!
And It's Sundae Treat.
Sundae Treat!
Come On, Sundae Treat!
It's Sundae Treat
By A Neck.
Come On, Boy!
Bengal Boy!
Sundae Treat, Bengal Boy. As They Head For The Finish,
Bengal Boy And Sundae Treat.
They Cross The Wire,
And It's Bengal Boy!
Bengal Boy!
So, Maybe You Can Make
A Comeback In The Next Race.
Guiding Light
Looks Good At Six Furlongs.
I Want That Money Back. And If I Don't Get It,
I Will Go Straight To The Police.
We Don't Want Any Trouble. I Mean,
It's Bad For Business. You Know What I Mean?
Hey, Charley.
Yeah?
You Remember The Wad That
Delaney Put On Sundae Treat?
Yeah.
Well, It Turns Out The Dough
Belongs To The Bishop Here.
It Belongs To The North Avenue Presbyterian Church.
And It's Reverend.
Well, See If You Can Work Something Out.
Uh, Not Here.
It Turns Out I'm Giving Money Back,
They'll Start A Stampede.
You Know What I Mean?
We'll Take Care
Of It.
All Right.
Let's Step Out Here.
Hey, Open Up!
Hey! Hey, Listen!
I'm Gonna Get Every Cent Back__
Hey, Mac, Everybody Else
Loses Their Shirts In There.
But, Mother Carlisle, It 
Was Brief And To The Point.
It Was A Disgrace.
I Have Never Been So__
How Come He Doesn't Have
Any Pants On?
Well, We__
We Don't Know Why.
We__ We Don't Question Why.
Why Don't We? Are We All Supposed To
Pretend He Has Pants On When He Doesn't?
MmHmm. Yes.
Morning. Morning.
It's Hard To Believe This Sort Of Activity's
Taking Place Right Here In The Center Of Town.
Well, This Will Make A Believer Out Of You, Captain.
It's Right Here.
It's This Way, Captain.
Just A Minute, Reverend.
Are You The Owner Here?
Yes, Sir.
Search Warrant.
It's Right Back Here.
Sam, Would You Mind?
Mind What?
The D__
Are You Sure You're In The Right Place,
Reverend Hill?
I'm Sure.
And If We'd Come Right Over When I Lodged
The Complaint, You Would've Seen For Yourself.
Well, This Is America. You Can't Just
Barge Into A Business And Arrest People...
Because Somebody Said So.
We'd Be Infringing
On Civil Rights.
I Don't Need A Lecture On
Civil Rights From You, Captain.
And I Know Of At Least Three Other
Illegal Gambling Spots In This Same Area.
Well, Give Me Those Addresses.
I'll Get The Necessary Warrants Right Away.
It's Obvious We're Wasting Each Other's Time.
I Have Work To Do.
And I'm Sure You Do Too,
Whatever It Is You Do.
Well, We'll Look Into It Further.
And If We Come Up With Anything, We'll Call You.
As Part Of This Station's
Public Service Programming,
We Invite The Pastors
Of New Campton's Churches...
To Address Us
On "Words To Live By."
This Evening's Message Is Brought
To Us By The Reverend Michael Hill...
Of The North Avenue
Presbyterian Church.
Another Day Is Closing.
But Revelation 22 Tells Us
That There Shall Be No Night,
And They Need No Candle,
For The Lord Giveth Them Light.
And I__
And I'mI'm Sorry.
But There Won't Be
Much Light In New Campton...
If We Don't Face
Another Revelation...
Of More Immediate Concern
To All Of Us.
I__ I've Just Moved
To New Campton,
And My Family And I Were
Delighted With What We Saw.
But It Was
Revealed To Me Today...
That Our Town Is Plagued,
Plagued By LargeScale
Illegal Gambling.
It Was Made Clear To Me
That This Criminal Element...
Works Hand In Glove
With Your Own Police Force.
Hold It. Leave It On.
A Complaint By A Citizen...
Does Not Result
In The Arrest Of The Guilty...
But In The Humiliation Of The Citizens
Foolish Enough To Register A Complaint.
If This Condition
Is So Obvious To Me,
Then The People Of New Campton
Cannot Possibly Be Ignorant Of It.
Well, It Doesn't Take
An Expert To See...
That LargeScale Gambling Can
Steadily And Systematically...
Drain A Town
Of Its Resources.
The Money That's Gambled And Lost
Here Does Not Recycle In Our Town.
It Funnels Into The Hands
Of Criminals And Crime Bosses.
This Money Is Then Used To Support
Other Forms Of Organized Crime,
Like Bribing City Management And Police Officials.
Way To Go, Rev. You Tell 'Em.
Tell Em?
He's Askin' For It.
If Our Police And Elected Officials
Cannot Or Will Not Rid Our Community...
Of These__ These Parasites,
Then They Should Be Replaced By People Who Will.
Thank You.
And God Bless You.
You Have Just Heard
"Words To Live By"__
Shut It Off.
That's The Same Guy,
Mr. Roca.
Maybe I Should've
Given His Dough Back.
It'll Blow Over.
So How Long Do I Gotta Stay Closed?
You Can Open Up Tomorrow.
We'll Keep
The Preacher In Line.
Thank You, Mr. Roca.
North Avenue Presbyterian Church.
May I Help You?
Who Should I Say
Is Calling?
Reverend, It's Another
Threat For You.
Forget It.
I'm Sorry. He's Not Taking Threats Without Names.
Hello.
Has The Committee Head Meeting Started Yet?
Uh, Maybe Later.
These Are For You.
Aren't They Beautiful?
Would You Excuse Us,
Mrs. Porter?
We're In The Middle
Of A Meeting.
Oh, I'm Sorry. I'm Sorry.
Put Them In This Vase.
They're Just Lovely.
All Right, Anne,
Where Were We?
It Boggles The Mind That You
Have The Unmitigated Gall...
To Use This Church AsAsAs A Soapbox
For Your SelfServing Ambitions.
SelfServing?
I Merely Put Out The Word...
That New Campton Is Being
Systematically Ripped Off By Gamblers.
Rubbish.
Our Own Church Has Lost Over $1,200.
Exactly.
And How Did It Get Lost?
Will Somebody
Answer That, Please?
I'll Get It.
Hello. North Avenue
Presbyterian Church.
Who?
Uh, Just A Minute, Please.
Dr. Fulton.
Who Is Dr. Fulton?
The Presbyterian Executive.
Excuse Me, Ladies.
Excuse Me.
Huh?
Please?
Dr. Fulton, What
A Pleasure To Hear From You.
I'll Come Right To The Point,
Reverend Hill.
General Council Feels That Prayer On
Television Is Intended To Be Just That.
It Is Not Intended As A Forum
For Politicking Or Mudslinging.
I Assure You, Dr. Fulton,
That Was Not The Talk I Had Prepared.
It Was Just
A SpurOfTheMoment Thing,
Prompted By My Experiences
Of Yesterday.
Dr. Fulton, They Have
A Real Problem In This Town.
Such Matters Are Not Your Concern, Reverend Hill.
They're Not?
Now, In The Future, We Suggest
You Concentrate Your Efforts...
On Revitalizing North Avenue
And Increasing The Membership.
Well, I__ I Had Planned To Go Out This
Afternoon And Do That Very Thing.
Uh, Well, If You Don't Drive,
Perhaps Your Son Could Bring You.
We'd Like To See
You Both At Church.
My Son Thinks
You're Some Kind Of A Nut.
Oh.
Well, I Have Some Appointments This Afternoon.
It's Been Nice Talking
To You, Mr. Younger.
I Understand You Were Once One Of
Our Most Active Members, Mrs. Gossin.
Well, My Ex Was Kind Of A Jesus Freak,
But When He Split, I Sort Of Lost Interest.
I'm Into Yoga Now. I Think There's Room
For Both In A Person's Life, Don't You?
Hmm, I Guess.
Got Time For A Drink?
Uh, No, I'm Afraid
I Haven't, Mrs. Gossin.
But I Do Hope
You Can Make It Sunday.
Â™ª
Okay.
Hi, Guys.
Uh, We Gave
At The Office.
No, No, No, No.
I Just Want To Talk To You About Your Music.
Sure.
I, Uh__ I Kind Of Have An Idea.
Everybody, I'd Like You To Meet Strawberry Shortcake.
Hi.
This Is Shorty,
Uh, Billy,
Doodles And Sam.
These Gentlemen Have Kindly
Consented To Serve The Lord...
By Helping Us Kind Of,
Uh, Hype Up The Crowd.
Hype It Up?
Yeah, Give It Some Pizzazz,
Attract Some
Of The Younger People.
Younger People?
Our Hymns Have Lasted For Centuries
Without The Benefit Of, Uh, Pizzazz.
Well, The Lord Never Asked His
Followers To Be LongFaced And Doleful.
He Said,
"Happy Are The People Whose God Is The Lord."
Amen.
I Think We Ought To Try Something New.
Well, That's Fine,
Reverend Hill.
I Think In That Case, Though,
That I Should Turn Over The Choir...
To Shorty Here
And The Shortcakes.
Uh, Excuse Me.
Hey, Who Is It?
Get
The Window.
Right.
Say, Who's There?
What's Going On Here?
What Do You Want?
Easy, Reverend. Easy.
I'm, Uh, Marv Fogelman.
This__ I Got Some I.D. Here Somewhere.
This Is My Partner Here,
Tom, Uh, Voorhees.
We're, Uh__
We're, Uh,
Special Investigators For The, Uh,
Treasury Department.
There It Is.
Did You Guys Ever Hear Of A Phone?
Uh, Thou Shalt Not Use The Telephone
Too Much In Our Business, Reverend.
People Listen.
We Heard About Your
Broadcast, Reverend Hill.
We Thought Maybe You
Could Give Us A Hand.
Doing What?
Breaking Up The Gambling
Organization Here In New Campton.
Ah, Thanks, But, Uh,
This Thing Has Put Me
On Thin Ice Already.
It Could Cost Me My Job.
We Don't Expect You
To Do Nothing.
You're Too Hot To Get Near
A Gambling Joint Now Anyway.
We Just Want You To Round Up A Few Men
You Can Trust, And We'll Take It From There.
What Do You Say?
For God And Country?
Mr. Webber,
They Need Men Like You,
Men That Are Known In The Community,
To Work With The Treasury Department...
And Then Testify
In Court.
Then Get A Rock Through My Window,
Or Worse.
If We Can Close Them Down, Then People
Won't Have To Be Afraid Of Things Like That.
I'm Sorry.
I've Got Customers.
Reverend, People Gamble.
They Always Have. They Always Will.
I'm Not Talking About A Poker Game On
Saturday Night Or A Day At The Races.
I'm Talking
About Organized Crime.
Have You Tried
Bob Purcell?
Mr. Purcell Plays Golf
With The Chief.
He Doesn't Want To Do Anything
To Strain The Relationship.
I Wish I Could Help You.
But It's Not Your Town Anymore.
It's Their Town.
Uh__
Yeah. Mm.
Yes, I Understand.
I Understand, Yeah.
Thanks.
Thanks Anyway. Yeah.
Come In.
Uh, Reverend Hill,
We're All Ready To Leave Now.
The Chairs Are All Folded
And Locked In The Storeroom.
The Newsletters Are All
Stamped And Ready For Mailing.
Oh, I__ I Regret
To Inform You...
That, Uh, The__ The Women's Association
Annual Bean And Salad Supper...
Will Be
A DollarFifty This Year...
Instead
Of The Usual Dollar.
Oh. Oh,
That Is Bad News.
So__
Well, Thank You, Claire.
You've All Been A Great Help.
Oh, You're Welcome.
Thank You.
You've All Been Very Helpful.
You've Been Very Gracious.
Thank You.
Thank You. Good Night.
Bye.
GoodBye.
Claire. Claire.
Uh, What Do You Do
In Your Spare Time?
Oh. Well, It's
Just One Mad World.
Take Tonight
For Instance.
I'm Going To See Casablanca
For The Eighth Time,
And, Uh, Then I'm Going To Dine On A
Peanut Butter And Banana Sandwich,
And Then I Will Hit
The Feathers.
It's Like That Every Night,
Just Frantic.
How Would You Like To Spice Up
Your Life A Little?
Oh, Need A Secretary For The
Youth Activities Committee?
Meet Me Tomorrow Night
At 9:00.
Nine?
Oh, Sure.
You Know Where I Live?
That's Too Conspicuous.
Make It The Sunday School Room.
The Sunday School__
Yeah, And Make It
The Side Entrance.
Side Entrance.
Oh, Claire,
How Pretty You Look.
Do You Look Beautiful!
Lovely.
Claire.
Ah, Glad You Could
Make It, Claire.
'Course You Know All The Girls.
Of Course. Hi.
Hi.
I'll Get You For This.
Now Will You Explain What
We're All Here For, Reverend?
You All Realize That
New Campton Is In Trouble.
There Are Some Men In Town That Need Our Help.
Our Help?
Why Us?
Because I Think You're Game
And Can Keep Your Mouth Shut.
Keep Our Mouths Shut?
Let Me Out Of Here.
I'm Expecting__
Sorry.
Excuse Us.
Who Was That?
Just A Minute.
What's With The Broads?
I Talked To Over 20 Men.
No Takers.
They Don't Want
To Make Waves.
So You Got
Ladies Instead, Reverend?
It's Either Those Ladies Or Nothing.
You Made The Wrong Choice.
No, I Don't Think So.
At Least Talk To Them.
Me, Talk?
Do They Know Why They're Here?
I, Uh, Thought I'd
Let You Handle That.
No, Don't Open The Door.
Uh, Ladies, Uh,
These Are The Gentlemen I Told You About.
Oh, How
Do You Do?
Hello.
They Work
For The Government.
This Is Marv Fogelman
And Tom... Voorhees.
Voorhees.
Uh, What He Means, Uh,
We're, Uh, Special Investigators For The, Uh,
Treasury Department.
We're Looking
For People...
To Do, Uh, Infiltration
And Undercover Work...
To Help Us Break Up The
Rackets Here In New Campton.
And, Uh,
Your Reverend...
Thinks That You Ladies
Could Hack It.
Have Any
Of You Ladies, Uh,
Ever Made A Bet
With A Bookie?
Ever Played The Numbers?
No. No, Bingo. We All Play Bingo Friday Nights.
Fridays.
Bingo, Huh?
Okay, Um,
Let's Start From Square One. You See,
Uh, You Would Be, Uh,
Expected To, Uh, Go...
Into Established Gambling
Joints, See, And Make Bets.
Now, If We Could Get
Two Witnesses...
Or If A Federal Officer Is Present
When You Make The Bet,
We Could Usually
Make It Stick.
Yeah. We Want To Build Airtight
Cases Against As Many As We Can.
Then We Lower
The Boom, See.
If We Close Down Enough Of Them,
Their Bank Dries Up.
Then You Get
Your Town Back.
You Mean To Say They
Even Have A Bank?
Well, They Call It
"The Bank" Or "The Office."
It's Where All The Money
And The Bank Slips Go.
The Big Man In This County
Is Max Roca.
Well, Anyhow, That's
The Bones Of It. Uh__
Yeah. Well, Ladies,
What Do You Think?
I'm In.
They Got Their Hooks
Into My BrotherInLaw.
He Can't Quit, And He Can't Get Even.
You Bet I'm In.
If It Keeps Me From Cleaning The Oven, I'm Game.
I'm Free On Mondays.
I Could Change My Exercise Class To
Wednesday And Take Macrame On Thursday.
I'd Like To Do My Part
For The Government.
However, Do You Have Provisions For BabySitting?
BabySitting?
Lady, This Is__
This Is
Tom's Department.

I'm Delighted To Meet You.
What About Guns?
No. No Guns.
I'd Rather You
Didn't Tell Anybody.
Think About It.
Who Would Suspect A Bunch
Of DingALing Dames?
After All,
It's Your Home, Howard.
We Can Put A Cot
In Your Room.
It's Foolish To Be Buying A House When
You Don't Know If It's Going To Work Out.
It'll Work Out
Just Fine, Mother.
Jane__ Jane's
A Wonderful Girl.
Then What's She Doing
Going... In There?

Oh, All My Life.
You From Out Of Town?
Minneapolis.
We Put Out A Line Of Gaskets For Diesel Engines.
Isn't That Exciting?
Let's Not Overdo It.
Oh.
Um, Today's My Birthday.
I'm 28 Years Old.
Congratulations.
Thank You. 
Here You Are. One Margarita.
Thank You Very Much.
Oh, Um, I'm Sorry.
Excuse Me.

Who Is__
Howard, I'll Call You Later.
Who Is That Man?
It's Just A Guy.

For You In The First Place.
Yes, Mother.
Maybe__ Maybe We Should Think It Over, Jane.
MmHmm. 
I'll Call The Church And Talk To Reverend__

I'm So Sorry.
Oh, Howard, My Baby.

You Brute!
Howard, Howard, I Can
Explain Everything.
I'll Explain It All.
I Can Explain It, Howard.
And She Hit Me.
What Do You Mean You Can Explain?
You Know What Kind Of A Person You Are?
I've Always Wanted
To Do Something Like This.
Something That Would Be
Interesting, Challenging...
And At The Same Time,
A Public Service.
You Know
What I Mean, Tom?
Yes, Ma'am.
There's Bootsie's Place.
Ooh, That's, Uh__
This Is It.
That's Right.
Wait A Minute. What Do I Say?
What Do I Say? What Is It? Tell Me Again.
When The Guy Comes Up, You Just Say,
"I Want Tickets On These Numbers."
I Want Tickets On These Numbers.
It Doesn't Matter
What The Combinations Are...
But No More Than Three Numbers In Any One Group.
When I Come In, I Say I Want
Tickets On These Combinations...
I Want A Ticket.
Of Groups Of__
Why Don't You Just Read It

I'll Get Your Copy.
How Did I Do?
I've, Uh, Never
Seen Anything To Top It.
Oh. Uh, If You Lose, Does The Treasury
Department Give You Back Your Money?
I Thought So.
Here's Your Order, Lady.
Oh__
And Next Time Take Your
Business Someplace Else.
Did You Have To Wear That?
We Look Like The Bobsey Twins.
Or Triplets.
Did You Make The Bet Yet?
Shh.
You Got It.
I Got A Tape Recorder.
Is It On?
No.
Why Don't You Put It On
So That It'll Be Running...
When We Make The Bet.
Good Idea.
Not That Way. That's Reverse.
What'll It Be?
Uh, Coffee.
Coffee.
Figures.
And A Fiver On 268.
My Horoscope Says That Even Numbers
Are Going To Be Very Lucky For Me Today.
Fin. 268.

Delaney Told Me
It Was A Blank Tape.
Mrs. Rafferty,
We're Fortunate We're Not Dead.
After All,
We Don't Even Look Like The Andrews Sisters.
Ladies!
Ladies!
Look, There Is No Point
In Rehashing It.
We Blew It,
All The Way Down The Line.
It Is Over, Done With.
It Was A Crazy Idea.
Not Your Fault.
I Accept Full Responsibility.
Yeah, Well,
I'm Sure We'll Handle It Better Next Time.
We Will. We'll Handle
It Better Next Time.
Next Time?
What Next Time?
The Way They Fixed It,
Serpico Couldn't Get In One Of Those Joints.
Well, What About In A Couple Of
Weeks When Things Cool Down?
Couple Of Weeks.
They Won't Even Know Us In A Couple Of Weeks.
Thanks, But No Thanks.
Hey, Just Because We Made A Couple Of Goofs,
You're Not Gonna Bench Us.
We're Not Out
Of The Ball Game Yet.
I Agree.
Frankly, I'd Like
To Stick It To 'Em Good.
What Did You Have
In Mind, Tiger?
Well, I Don't Know.
I Have An Idea.
Uh, Why Don't We Go After That
Bank You Told Us About? Yes?
You Said If They Dried Up The Bank,
They'd Go Out Of Town.
Whoa, Whoa,
Whoa, Whoa.
Now, Look, You're A Gung Ho Bunch Of Dames.
I Like That.
But It Takes Professionals Years To Find A Bank,
If They're Lucky.
There Is No Way That Five
Inexperienced Ladies__
Oh!
Capable As You Are__ Are Gonna Find Their Bank.
Why Not?
Who'd Ever Suspect Us Of Following Them?
Following Them?
Lady, When Those Pickup Men
Are Carrying Slips And Money,
They're Checking
For Tails All The Way.
I Mean, You Would Need
Your Expert Drivers,
You Would Need
Your Code Names,
You Would Need Your
RadioEquipped Cars For SwitchOffs.
We Got The Drivers.
We Got The Cars.
First Of All, My Department Would Never Spring For It.
So Forget It.
I Will Spring For The Radios,
If You All Would Like To Use Them.
Claire, That's Terrific.
So?
Yeah.
How About It?
Marv, Give Us A Chance.
Why Not?
I Don't Know.
It's Like Chicken Soup.
It Won't Do Any Good,
But It Couldn't Hurt.
I Guess!
This Is Home Plate
Calling All Units.
Hold It! Hold It!
I Told Youse, You Can
Only Talk One At A Time.
Uh, Phantom Fox.
Uh, Max And I Are Watching Freddie, Uh,
Two Fingers Snooker Parlor, And, Uh,
I Expect To Be Murdered
Any Minute.
If That Should Happen,
Would Somebody Please Contact Alfredo?
He Does My Hair.
TenFour.
Five Dames
Ain't Ever Gonna Find No Bank.
We'll Be Lucky If They Don't Get Us All Killed.
If You Want Me Honest Opinion,
It's A WildDuck Chase.
Who__ Who__
Who Is That?
It Sounds Like Delaney Rafferty.
Blarney Stone,
The Whole Idea Is That They'd Be Less
Suspicious With Women Following Them.
I Know. I Know.
But I Can't Drive, Reverend.
And You'll Never
Recognize Delaney.
Don't Use My Name,
I Told Ya.
If It Got Out
What I Was Doing,
I'd Be Spending The Night In The River,
That's What. Them Guys Play For Keeps.
Today's Cooking Corner Recipe
Is A Fantasy All Of Us Know.
It's Called
Fairy Queen Pudding. Mmm.
First You Prepare
Four Egg Whites.
June Bride.
There's A Man Leaving Big Chin's With A Paper Bag.
This Could Be The Pickup Man.
Describe The Suspect, Please.
Brown Pants
And A Blue Jacket...
With Red And White Stripes
Down The Sleeves.
I Think
It's A Polyester.
June Bride,
What Is He Doing Now?
I Don't Know.
He's Gone. He Drove Off.
Follow Him!
All Right.
Don't Shout.
Of All The Dumb, Stupid Broads!
My Acid Is Flowing.
June Bride, Uh,
Could You Describe The Car?
Yes. It Was Olive Green.
No, Maybe It Was
More Avocado.
Well, It Was Lighter Than A Forest
Green But Not As Bright As Kelly Green.
I Think We Better Stick
With Avocado.
Try To Locate The Car,
And Hurry!
Please.
Please.
I See Him.
He's Driving A Plymouth.
He's On Lexington.
Okay, Okay. Beautiful.
That's Good.
Which Way On Lexington?
Towards That New Boutique.
She's Trying
To Kill Me.
I Think She Means East.
I'm Getting Stopped By A Red Light.
Am I Allowed To Run It?
No, No. Stop.
Marv, Kiddie Car Could Probably Pick Him Up.
Kiddie Car, Come In.
Please!
Oh. Um__ Um, Hello.
Uh, Excuse Me.
All Right, All Right, Toby,
Give Betty Back Her Creepy Crawlers.
Toby, They're
Her Creepy Crawlers.
Hold The Line.
Toby, You Have Your Ray Gun.
You Don't Need Her Creepy Crawlers.
Marvin, Will You Tell Toby To Give
Betty Back Her Creepy Crawlers.
I Will, If You'll Go To Lexington And
Look For A Green Plymouth, And Hurry.
I Can't. I'm Not
Anywhere Near There.
You're Supposed To Be.
I Was,
But I Forgot Today Was My Day To Pick Up The Cobras.
Pick Up What?
The Cobras.
They're Six And Two
On The Season.
If They Take The Tigers,
They're A Cinch For The PlayOffs.
How Long Will It Take You To Get
To Lexington And High Street?
We Can Leave...
Just As Soon As The Shortstop
Gets Out Of The Boys Room.
Tell Them All To Go Home.
Forget It. It's All Over.
Listen, Marv, If He Stays East On Lexington,
Clunker Could Pick Him Up.
Clunker?
Have We
Had That One Yet?
Not Yet.
Clunker, Are You There?
Ready To Go.
Good.
Could You Go To Lexington And Look
For A Green Plymouth? On My Way.
She's Going.
Come On,
You Rare Beauty.
Clunker, The Driver Is Wearing A Blue
Jacket With Red And White Stripes.
Gotcha.
Come On, Baby.
We Gotta Take A Hike.
Gotta Help Auntie Cleo.
That's A Precious Lamb.
Yes, Indeed.
Good Boy. Good Boy. Good Boy.
Yes, Yes, Yes.
Here You Are. Here You Are.
This Your Car?
No, Sir. It Belongs
To Classic Used Cars.
My Husband Works There.
I See. Uh, Didn't You
See The Sign?
Oh, Boy.
May I See Your
Operator's License, Please?
Here You Are, Sir.
Thank You.
Watch It, Lady.
Watch It. Watch It.
I Got Him.
Good.
He's Not On Lexington.
He's On King Street.
I'm Right Beside Him.
Does He Still Have
The Bag, Clunker?
Clunker, Does He Still
Have The Bag? Answer.
Clunker, Answer.
I Can't See.
Go To Sleep For Mama. Nice Baby. 
What's With "Go To Sleep"?
Can You At Least Get
The License Number?
Hey, You, Lady! 
Clunker, What Are You Doing?
Will You Give Us
The License Number?
Now, You Listen To Me.
You Keep Quiet Till I Tell You, You Hear?
Or You'll Wish You Had.
That's No Way
To Talk To That Infant.
Butt Out, Lady.
Hey! Hey!
Hey, Lady,
I Could Cite You For Evading Arrest.
And If That Piece Of Junk
Isn't Moved In Five Minutes,
I'm Gonna Have It
Towed Away And Impounded.
You Got Yourself A Deal.
I Lost Him For A Moment,
Home Plate, But I Got Him Now.
He's Coming Out Of A Market,
And He's Driving North On Crown Street.
Good. Stay With Him.
Can't Do It, Home Plate.
I'm Out Of Gas.
What?
Give It To Phantom Fox.
Phantom Fox,
He's Coming Your Way. Move Out.
With Pleasure.

In The__ In The Garbage.
Mr. Martin, Please.
Check Okay
On Register Number Six.
Hi, Mom!
Hi! Hi!
Hi.
Why Are You Buying
So Much Cheerios?
I'm Not.
What Do You Know About Shopping?
Go__ Go Find
Your Little Sister.
Can We Get
Some Ice Cream?
Ah, Yes. Don't
Bother Mommy Now.
Thanks, Mom!
Excuse Me.
He's Still At
The Magazine Stand.
Just Be Patient.
This Is Where We Blew It Yesterday.
He Keeps Checking His Watch
And Looking Out The Window.
The Other Guy Must Be Late.
Keep Watching Him!
There's Another Man Who
Came In With A Paper Bag.
This Could Be A Pass.
Everybody Stay Awake.
They Did It. They Did It.
They Switched Bags. They're Leaving.
Okay.
Follow Him.
Follow Him? Which One?
The One With The Bag!
They Both Have Bags.
The Newer One With The Old Bag.
Oh, Uh, Yes.
He's On His Way Out The Door,
And He Has
A Plaid Shirt On.
I See Him!
Subject Is A Male Caucasian
About, I Don't Know, 5'8,
Sandy Hair And A Little
Paunchy.
He's Getting Into
A Little White Car.
All Units, Plan "A."
Look For A Little, Uh, White Car.

Danny Avenue.
Stay With Him.

He's Speeding Up, Home Plate.
You're Burned. You're Burned. Peel Off!
Peel Off!
Peel Off!
Who's Got Him?
Who's Got Him?
Not I, Home Plate.
I Peeled Off As Instructed.
Not Me.
I Peeled Off.
We Did Like You Told Us.
Me Too!
I Just Peeled Off.
They All Peeled Off?
I Got Him!
I Got Him!
Break For Phantom Fox.
Suspect In View.
Rear View.
Phantom Fox,
Where Are You Located?
I'm On__ I'm On 4th Street.
He's Right Behind Me.
All Right, Now.
Now, Listen.
Listen, Slow Down,
Let Him Pass You And Stay With Him.
He's Turn__ He Turned Down The Alley,
Down On Jefferson.
That's All Right.
Turn Around And Go Back.
She Can't Turn, Marv.
That's A OneWay Street.
Phantom Fox, We'll Give You Instructions.
You Can't Turn.
I Can't Back Up Either.
Well, I'll Try.
There He Is, Down The Alley.
I'll Double Back.
All Right, That's Good,
But Do Not Get Too Close.
Do Not Get Too Close.
I'm Terribly Sorry.
Are You All Right?
Look What You Did.
Are You Crazy, Lady?
Phantom Fox, What's Happening?
Here, Let Me Have That Thing.
Phantom Fox, If You've Lost Him,
Return To North Avenue For Further__
Don't Say North Avenue On The Thing!
They'll Hear You!
I Never Could Stand
That Show.
The Doctor Said Complete Rest
And Quiet For A Few Days,
But You Can Talk To Him.
Hi, Marv.
How Are You Feeling?
Wonderful.
Marv, The Girls And I
Were Talking.
And, Uh, Well,
They'd Like To Take
Another Shot At It.
Reverend, We Shot At It...
Three Times.
Each Time,
It Was A Fiasco.
My Stomach Isn't Up To It.
Claire Said She'd Get A Radio
For My Office At The Church.
It's Her Money.
Get Two.
Then I'll Tell Them
It's Okay To Continue?
Tell Them Anything You Want,
As Long As I Don't Have
To Hear It Or Be There.
Thanks, Marv.
Hope You Feel Better.
I'll Be In Touch.
Don't Bother.
Mike, He's Doing
Just As You Said, Home Plate.
He's Coming Back
On Raymond.
He's Stopping.
He's Making A Pass...
To A White Cable Tv Van.
He Could Be The Collector.
Let The Car Go.
Stay With The Van.
He's Leaving,
And I'm Right Behind Him.
Now, This Can't Take
Very Long, Home Plate.
It's Karate Day,
The Girls Are Having A Recital,
I'm Having A Tupperware Party
In A Half Hour.
He's Turning Left__
Left On Victory.
Bruno, Out Of The__ What'll I Do?
Bruno! Bruno!
Let Him Go.
Blarney Stone, You're Near.
That's Us!
Get Going!
It'll Take At Least
Ten Minutes From Here.
Oh, No, It Won't.
If Ya Can't Drive,
Don't Be Touchin' The Wheel!
We're Takin'
A Little Shortcut.
Blarney Stone, Where Is He?
Do You Copy?
Blarney Stone,
Have You Spotted Him?
Where Are You?
Don't Ask!
Get Off The Track!
Don't Yell At Me!
Who Do You Think
You Are?
All Units, We Lost Him.
Come On In. Home Plate Out.
What Is This?
What Are You Doing?
Are You A Minister Or Batman?
Look At This.
You've Turned This Into A War Room.
Anne__
Sit Down. Sit Down.
I've Got Something To Tell You.
I Didn't Mind About The__
Please, Sit Down.
The Treasury Department
Asked Me To Help Them.
The Treasury Department?
They Came To Me.
They Need Us.
Why?
Chasing Criminals Has Nothing
To Do With You Or North Avenue.
The Police Are Paid
To Do That.
Oh, The Police.
In This Town?
Yes.
Anne, You Said It Yourself.
Somebody Has To Do It.
If The Church Is Not
A Moral Force In The Community,
Then It's Just Another Building With
Stained Glass Windows And A Steeple.
But You Are Meddling In Something
Dangerous With All This.
I Think The Only Thing You're
Gonna Accomplish In The End...
IsIs Harm To The Church.
Yes, But They're Actually
Making Headway.
Those Women, In Their Own Crazy Way,
Are Giving The Mob Fits.
If We Can Just Hang In There,
We Can Put A Crimp In Their Operation,
Maybe Stop It Altogether.
We Get Closer Every Day.
Today, I Think We Found The Collector.
You're All Risking
Your Lives__
Well, ThatThat's It.
I'll Have No Part Of Any Of That.
I Resign As Your Secretary.
And I'm Going To Go To The Executive
Committee And Tell Them Why.
Anne.
What?
I Do Understand
How You Feel,
But I Don't Know
What Else To Do.
Give It Up.

Amen!
What Are They Trying To Do?
Find The Bank,
Close Us Down.
Do They All Work For Hill?
One Of 'Em We Know
Goes To His Church.
Hill Isn't An Ordinary Guy
Off The Streets.
We Hit Him,
The Papers Get In On It,
The Cops Have To Do
A Number.
Well, They're Slowin' Up
The Work, Sir,
And Things Are Gonna Get Worse
If We Don't Do Somethin'.
Okay. Lean On 'Em.
I'm Awake.
Yeah?
Hey.
What's All That About?
Did Miss Woods
Mean What She Said?
Well, She Strikes Me As
The Kind Of Person That Does.
I Mean...
Are You Really Gonna
Lose Your Job?
Oh.
Well, I Certainly Hope Not.
Dad, Why Don't You Give It Up?
It's Not Your Business.
Sayeth Carmel.
Why Can't You Just Be
A Minister And A Daddy?
Oh, Honey, That's__
That's What I'm Trying To Be.
Help!
Oh, Help, Somebody!
Call The Fire Department!
Help!
Carmel,
Call The Fire Department!
Are You All Right?
Yes!
Call The Fire Department!
Hank, Come Here!
Help Me With The Fire Hose!
Turn It On!
Hey, You,
Would You Help Here A Minute?
The Rest Of You, Get Back!
I Had No Idea...
They'd Do This.
I'm Sorry, Anne.
It Would Help
If You'd Say Something.
Anything.
I, Uh__
I Was So Wrong.
So Wrong.
Mike, Um__
I...
Wanna Fight Them With You.
Rookie?
Rookie, What's Happening?
Lost Him, Home Plate.
Sorry, Mike.
Yuck!
Whose Chili Dog Is This?
I Got Him, I Got Him.
I'm Right Behind Him.
Good, Phantom Fox.
Stay With Him, Stay With Him.
You Dummy!
What Do You Think You're__
Watch Out!
Phantom Fox, What's Going On?
I Got Cut Off
At The Pass.
Get Closer!
Watch Out For That Car!
Take Your Hands
Off The Wheel!
There's A Lady!
Look Out!
Look What You Did!
I'm Trying To Stay With Him,
Home Plate,
But He's Really Moving!
Be Careful, June Bride.
Be Careful.
Are You All Right,
June Bride?
Yes, But I Don't Know What
Howard's Gonna Say About His Car.
We're Turning On Klump Street,
And I'm On His Tail.
Good Going, Rookie.
Hang In There.
Yahoo!
Not This Time.
Where Could He Have Gone To?
I Don't Know,
But I'm Having Trouble With My Radio Again.
I'm Coming In.
When We Don't Pay The Winners Off On Time,
They Get Nervous.
They Think Something's Wrong.
Business Falls Off. We Don't Want That.
They Got Stakeouts
On Every Road.
I Lose One, I Look Back,
There's Another One Comin'.
They Ain't As Easy To Shake
As They Used To Be.
A Bunch Of Church Ladies?
I'm Not Gonna Let A Preacher...
And Some DingALing Dames
Ruin Our Business.
They Get Too Close
To This Place, Hit 'Em.
Yes, Sir.
Every Time The Collector
Has Shaken Us,
It's Been In Here.
Then The Bank
Must Be In There.
Probably, But It's Still
A Very Big Area.
It Sure Is.
Well, He Just Plain
Outdrives Us.
Not Necessarily.
I Don't Know What He Fuels
That Crate With.
Now, He's Obviously Got Something
Bigger Than A Stock Engine Under There.
You Can Say That Again.
That's Right.
"Dear Reverend Hill,
The General Council...
"Has Voted Not To Rebuild
North Avenue.
North Avenue Has Served Its
Purpose And Will Be Dissolved."
Well__
Dissolved.
Well, We'll Appeal That.
I'llI'll Call The Presbytery Myself.
"Further, It Is The Intention
Of The General Council...
"To Declare The Pulpit
Of North Avenue Vacant.
"Dr. Rheems And Reverend
Wainwright Will Be Joining Me...
"For The Disposition
Of The Real Estate.
Sincerely Yours, Victor A.
Fulton, Presbytery Executive."
Oh, Mike,
I'm So Sorry.
What Exactly Does That Mean,
"Declare The Pulpit Vacant"?
It Means He's Fired.
It Means I'veI've...
Cost You Your Church.
Â™ª
We Certainly Have Lovely
Weather For You Folks.
Unfortunately, We're Not Here
To Enjoy The Weather.
Has Dr. Fulton Arrived?
Oh, Yes.
He's With Reverend Hill Right Now.
There's Certainly A Lot
Of Static On Your Radio.
Yeah.
Oh!
Mike?
Mike, Answer!
Answer!
Glen Park Church Is Over
Five Miles From Here, And__
What's That Beeping Noise?
Oh__ Oh, That's A Radio
I Use For Emergencies.
And, You Know, Transportation Will Be A Real
Problem For Some Of Our Older Members.
Hadn't You Better
Answer That?
II__ Oh, Sure.
Reverend Hill Speaking.
Mike, Hi. I Think
I Found The Missing Link.
I'm Tailing A Camper
South On Airport.
Uh, Could We Discuss This At A More Propitious Time?
I'm In Conference Just Now.
No, This Won't Wait!
I'm Positive This Is The Collection
Van Disguised As A Camper,
Because The Motor Is Giving Over
The Same Static Over The Radio.
Can't You Hear It?
That's Hardly Conclusive.
I Recognize The Driver.
It's The Same Guy.
Aren't You Supposed To Be
Picking Up Some People?
Oh. Uh, Yeah,
They're Here.
Mike, Look, Uh,
If It's Old Sourpuss Fulton
That You're Worried About,
Well, He Wouldn't Know
A Good Minister...
If God Put His Arm Around Him
And Said, "That's My Boy."
Know What I Mean?
This Is It.
Please Send Us Some Help.
Excuse Me, Dr. Fulton,
But This Is Really Important.
Okay, Rookie.
