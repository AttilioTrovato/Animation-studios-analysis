Will.
Why is this happening?
I don't know.
You look beautiful.
I think it's bad luck for the groom
to see the bride before the wedding.
Make way. Let me through. What in__?
How dare you.
Stand your men down at once!
Do you hear me?
Governor Weatherby Swann,
it's been too long.
Cutler Beckett?
It's Lord now, actually.
Lord or not, you have no reason
and no authority to arrest this man.
In fact, I do.
Mr. Mercer.
The warrant for the arrest
of one William Turner.
This warrant is for Elizabeth Swann.
Oh, is it? That's annoying.
My mistake. Arrest her.
On what charges?
No!
Here's the one for William Turner.
And I have another one for
a Mr. James Norrington. Is he present?
What are the charges?
Commodore Norrington resigned
his commission some months ago.
I don't believe that was the answer
to the question I asked.
Lord Beckett, in the category of questions
not answered.
We are under the jurisdiction
of the king's governor of Port Royal
and you will tell us
what we are charged with.
The charge is:
"Conspiring to set free a man
convicted of crimes
against the crown and empire
and condemned to death.
For which the__"
For which the punishment, regrettably,
is also death.
Perhaps you remember a certain pirate
named Jack Sparrow.
Captain.
Captain.
Captain Jack Sparrow.
Captain Jack Sparrow.
Yes, I thought you might.
Fifteen men on a dead man's chest 
Yohoho, and a bottle of rum 
Drink and the devil
Had done for the rest 
Yohoho, and a bottle of rum 
Aye there. Come on.
Oh, God. I don't want this.
Oh, God. No. Please help me. No.
No! No!
Sorry, mate.
Mind if we make a little side trip?
I didn't think so.
Not quite according to plan.
Complications arose, ensued,
were overcome.
You got what you went in for, then?
Captain, I think the crew,
meaning me as well,
were expecting something
a bit more shiny.
What with the Isla de Muerta
going all pearshaped,
reclaimed by the sea
and the treasure with it.
And the Royal Navy chasing us
all around the Atlantic.
And the hurricane.
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.
All in all, it's seems some time
since we did a speck of honest pirating.
Shiny?
Aye, shiny,
Is that how you're all feeling, then?
That perhaps dear old Jack is not serving
your best interests as captain?
Walk the plank.
What did the bird say?
Do not blame the bird.
Show us what is on that piece
of cloth there.
You know that don't do no good.
It does me.
It's a key.
No.
Much more better.
It is a drawing of a key.
Gentlemen,
what do keys do?
Keys
unlock things?
And whatever this key unlocks, inside,
there's something valuable.
So we're setting out to find
whatever this key unlocks.
No.
If we don't have the key, we can't open
whatever it is we don't have that it unlocks.
So, what purpose would be served
in finding whatever need be unlocked,
which we don't have, without first
having found the key what unlocks it?
So we're going after this key.
You're not making any sense at all.
Any more questions?
So do we have a heading?
A heading.
Set sail in a...
general...
that way direction.
Captain?
Come on, snap to and make sail,
you know how this works. Come on.
Have you noticed lately the captain
seems to be acting a bit strange__
__er?
Setting sail
without knowing his own heading?
Something's got Jack vexed.
Mark my words, what bodes ill
for Jack Sparrow bodes ill for us all.
Lord Beckett,
the prisoner as ordered, sir.
Those won't be necessary.
The East India Trading Company
has need of your services.
We wish for you to act as our agent
in a business transaction
with our mutual friend, Captain Sparrow.
More acquaintance than friend.
How do you know him?
We've had dealings in the past.
And we've each left our mark
on the other.
What mark did he leave on you?
By your efforts,
Jack Sparrow was set free.
I would like you to go to him
and recover a certain property
in his possession.
Recover. At the point of a sword?
Bargain.
Letters of marque.
You will offer what amounts
to a full pardon.
Jack will be free,
a privateer in the employ of England.
Somehow I doubt Jack
will consider employment
the same as being free.
Freedom.
Jack Sparrow is a dying breed.
The world is shrinking,
the blank edges of the map filled in.
Jack must find his place in the new world
or perish.
Not unlike you, Mr. Turner.
You and your fianc√©e
face the hangman's noose.
So you get both Jack
and the Black Pearl.
The Black Pearl? 
The property you want
that he possesses.
A ship? Hardly.
The item in question's considerably
smaller and far more valuable.
Something Sparrow keeps
on his person at all times.
A compass.
You know it.
Bring back that compass
or there's no deal.
Why is the rum always gone?
That's why.
As you were, gents.
Time's run out, Jack.
Bootstrap.
Bill Turner?
You look good, Jack.
Is this a dream?
No.
I thought not. If it were, there'd be rum.
You got the Pearl back, I see.
I had some help retrieving the Pearl,
by the way.
Your son.
William?
Ended up a pirate after all.
And to what do I owe the pleasure
of your carbuncle?
He sent me.
Davy Jones.
So it's you, then.
He shanghaied you into service, eh?
I chose it
I'm sorry for the part I played
in the mutiny against you, Jack.
I stood up for you.
Everything went wrong after that.
They strapped me to a cannon.
I ended up on the bottom of the ocean,
the weight of the water
crushing down on me.
Unable to move.
Unable to die, Jack.
And I thought that even the tiniest hope
of escaping this fate, I would take it.
I would trade anything for it.
It's funny what a man will do
to forestall his final judgment.
You made a deal with him too, Jack.
He raised the Pearl 
from the depths for you.
Thirteen years,
you've been her captain.
Technically
Jack.
You won't be able
to talk yourself out of this.
The terms what applied to me
apply to you as well.
One soul bound to crew
a hundred years upon his ship.
Yes, but the Flying Dutchman
already has a captain, so there's really__
Then it's the Locker for you.
Jones's terrible leviathan will find you
and drag the Pearl back to the depths
and you along with it.
Any idea when Jones might release
said terrible beastie?
I already told you, Jack.
The time is up.
It comes now,
drawn with ravenous hunger
to the man what bears the black spot.
On deck, all hands!
Make fast the bunt gasket!
On deck! Scurry!
Scurry. I want movement! Movement.
I want movement! Lift the skin up.
Keep your loof.
Haul those sheets.
Run them. Run. Keep running.
Run as if the devil himself
and itself is upon us!
Do we have a heading?
We run. Land.
Which port?
I didn't say port. I said land. Any land.
Jack's hat. Clear about.
No, no. Leave it.
Run.
Back to your stations, the lot of you!
Jack? For the love of mother and child,
Jack, what's coming after us?
Nothing.
Here, now. You can't be here.
I think you'll find he can.
Mr. Swann.
Governor Swann, still.
Do you think I wear this wig
to keep my head warm?
Jack's compass?
What does Beckett want with that?
Does it matter?
I'm to find Jack
and convince him to return to Port Royal.
In exchange, the charges against us
will be dropped.
No. We must find our own avenue
to secure your freedom.
Is that lack of faith in Jack or in me?
That you would risk your life
to save Sparrow's
does not mean that he would do the same
for anyone else.
Now,
where is that dog with the keys?
I have faith in you.
Both of you.
Where will you find him?
Tortuga.
I'll start there and I won't stop searching
till I find him.
And then I intend to return here
to marry you.
Properly?
Eagerly, if you'll still have me.
If it weren't for these bars,
I'd have you already.
I'll wait for you.
Keep a weather eye on the horizon.
Captain Jack Sparrow?
Owes me 4 doubloons.
Heard he was dead.
Singapore is what I heard.
Drunk, with a smile on his face.
Sure as the tide,
Jack Sparrow will turn up in Singapore.
Jack Sparrow.
I haven't seen him in a month.
When you find him,
will you give him a message?
Cannot say about Jack Sparrow.
But there's a island,
just south of the straits,
where I trade spice
for delicious long pork.
Cannot say about Jack.
But you find a ship there.
A ship with black sails.
My brother will take you ashore.
What's wrong?
The beach is right there.
What?
Jack!
Jack Sparrow!
Marty!
Cotton!
Anybody?
A familiar face.
Don't eat me.
I'm not gonna eat you.
Don't eat me. No. Don't eat me.
Gibbs.
Come on! Let's go!
Come on! Who wants it?
I could do this all day!
Jack?
Jack Sparrow.
I can honestly say I'm glad to see you.
Jack, it's me. Will Turner.
Tell them to let me down.
Snip, snip.
Jack, the compass.
That's all I need. Elizabeth is in danger.
We were arrested for trying to help you.
She faces the gallows!
Savvy?
Save me.
Jack, what did you tell them?
No!
What about Elizabeth?
Jack!
That's a good girl. Come on.
Come on now.
A bit closer.
We don't bite. Come on.
What is taking your boy?
Come quickly.
Where are you going, me lady?
What's happening?
Our name still has some standing
with the King.
I've arranged passage to England.
The captain is a friend of mine.
No!
Will is going to find Jack!
We cannot count
on William Turner. Come.
He's a better man
than you give him credit for.
Oh, please. This is no time for innocence.
Beckett has offered one pardon only, one,
and that is promised to Jack Sparrow.
Even if Will succeeds,
do not ask me to endure the sight
of my daughter walking to the gallows.
Do not.
Perhaps I can ensure a fair trial
for Will if he returns.
A fair trial for Will ends in a hanging.
Then there is nothing left for you here.
Wait inside.
Captain.
Captain.
Evening, governor.
Shame, that.
He was carrying this.
It's a letter to the King.
It's from you.
Okay, rank form up to the left.
Elizabeth.
What are you doing?
Where is she?
Who?
No doubt you've discovered that loyalty
is no longer the currency of the realm,
as your father believes.
Then what is?
I'm afraid currency
is the currency of the realm.
I expect then that we can come
to some sort of understanding.
I'm here to negotiate.
I'm listening.
I'm listening intently.
These letters of marque,
they are signed by the King?
Yes, and they're not valid
until they bear my signature and my seal.
Or else I would not still be here.
You sent Will to get you the compass
owned by Jack Sparrow.
It will do you no good.
Do explain.
I have been to Isla de Muerta,
I have seen the treasure myself.
There is something you need to know.
I see.
You think the compass leads
only to the Isla de Muerta
and so you hope to save me
from an evil fate.
But you mustn't worry.
I care not for cursed Aztec gold.
My desires are not so provincial.
There's more than one chest of value
in these waters.
So perhaps you may wish
to enhance your offer.
Consider into your calculations
that you robbed me of my wedding night.
So I did.
A marriage interrupted.
Or fate intervenes
You're making great efforts
to ensure Jack Sparrow's freedom.
These aren't going to Jack.
Oh, really?
To ensure Mr. Turner's freedom then?
I'll still want that compass.
Consider that in your calculations.
Well, I say it was divine providence
what escaped us from jail.
And I say it was me being clever.
Ain't that right, poochie?
Well, how did you know it weren't divine
providence what inspired you to be clever?
Anyways, I ain't stealing no ship.
It ain't stealing. It's salvaging.
And since when did you care?
Since we're not immortal no more.
We gotta take care of our immortal souls.
You know you can't read.
It's the Bible. You get credit for trying.
Pretending to read the Bible's a lie!
That's a mark against:
Look.
There it is.
What's got into him?
Must have seen a catfish.
Stupid mongrel!
You want me to prove it,
give it back to me.
All right! All right!
Come on!
It's ours for the taking.
Tide's coming in, that should help.
Well, salvaging is saving,
in a manner of speaking.
There's the truth of it.
I suppose we better save it
as soon as we can,
what with our souls
in such a vulnerable state and all.
Amen to that.
Thank you.
Why would he do this to us?
If Jack is the chief__
Aye, the Pelegostos made Jack
their chief.
But he only remains chief
as long as he acts like a chief.
So he had no choice.
He's a captive then
as much as the rest of us.
Worse as it turns out.
See, the Pelegostos believe
that Jack is a god in human form
and they intend to do him the honour
of releasing him from his fleshy prison.
They'll roast him and eat him.
Where's the rest of the crew?
These cages we're in weren't built
till after we got here.
The feast is about to begin.
Jack's life will end
when the drums stop.
Well, we can't just sit here
and wait then, can we?
No, no.
No, no. More wood.
Big fire. Big fire.
I am chief. Want big fire. Come on.
Come on. More wood.
Oh, bugger.
Little seasoning, eh?
Well done.
Put your legs through, start to climb!
Come on, men. It'll take all of us
to crew the Black Pearl.
Actually, you wouldn't need everyone.
About six would do.
Oh, dear.
Hurry!
Come on, boys!
Come on, go! Go!
Come on! Is that all you got?
Hey.
To the top!
First__
Wait. Stop.
_ stop
_ stop 
What are they doing?
Stop.
Stop. Stop.
Snake.
Oh, no.
Move!
Come on, boys!
Well, go on. Go get them.
No, no.
Not good.
Cut it loose! Find a rock!
Roll the cage!
Come on.
No!
Lift the cage! Hurry!
Come on, lads! Lift it like a lady's skirt!
Come on!
This way, lads!
Take cover!
Stop it!
Bugger
Haul loose the mooring line!
The mooring line!
Thief! Little hairy thief! Give it back!
Don't bite it!
Haul loose the mooring line!
He's got me eye. He won't give it back.
Well, how'd you get it back last time?
Excellent! Our work's half done.
We done it for you,
knowing you'd be coming back for it.
Make ready to sail, boys!
What about Jack?
I won't leave without him.
Time to go.
Cast off those lines!
Make ready to cast off!
Good doggy
Alas, my children, this is the day
you shall always remember
as the day that you almost__
Captain Jack Sparrow.
Let's put some distance between us
and this island and head out to open sea.
Yes to the first. Yes to the second,
but only insofar as we keep
to the shallows as much as possible.
That seems a bit contradictory, captain.
I have every faith in your reconciliatory
navigational skills, Master Gibbs.
Now, where is that monkey?
I want to shoot something.
Jack. Elizabeth is in danger.
Have you considered keeping
a watchful eye?
Just lock her up somewhere.
She is locked up in a prison,
bound to hang for helping you.
There comes a time when one must
take responsibility for one's mistakes.
I need that compass of yours, Jack.
I must trade it for her freedom.
Mr. Gibbs.
Captain.
We have a need to travel upriver.
By need, do you mean a trifling need?
Fleeting? As in, say, a passing fancy?
No, a resolute and unyielding need.
What we need to do
is make sail for Port Royal with all haste.
William,
I shall trade you the compass
if you will help me to find this.
You want me to find this?
No.
You want you to find this,
because the finding of this
finds you incapacitorially finding
and/or locating in your discovering
the detecting of a way
to save your dolly belle,
ol' what'sherface. Savvy?
This is going to save Elizabeth?
How much do you know
about Davy Jones?
Not much.
Yeah, it's gonna save Elizabeth.
What's all this?
If you both fancy the dress, you'll just have
to share and wear it one after the other.
No, it's not like that, sir.
This ship is haunted.
Is it, now? And you?
There's a female presence
amongst us here, sir.
All the men, they can feel it.
Aye.
It's the ghost of a lady widowed
before her marriage, I figure it,
searching for her husband, lost at sea.
A virgin too, likely as not.
And that bodes ill by all accounts.
I say that we throw the dress overboard
and we hope the spirit follows it.
No! That will just anger the spirit, sir.
What we need to do
is to find out what the spirit needs,
and then just get it back to her.
Enough! Enough!
You're a pair of superstitious goats
and it's got the best of you.
Now, this appears to be no more
as we have a stowaway on board.
A young woman, by the look of it.
I want you to search the ship
and find her.
Oh, and she's probably naked.
Why is Jack afraid of the open ocean?
Well, if you believe such things,
there's a beast does the bidding
of Davy Jones.
A fearsome creature with giant tentacles
that'll suction your face clean off
and drag an entire ship
down to the crushing darkness.
The Kraken.
They say the stench of its breath is...
Imagine, the last thing you know
on God's green earth
is the roar of the Kraken
and the reeking odour
of a thousand rotting corpses.
If you believe such things.
And the key will spare him that?
Well, that's the very question
Jack wants answered.
Bad enough even to go visit her.
Her?
Aye.
No worries, mates.
Tia Dalma and I go way back.
Thick as thieves.
Nigh inseparable, we are.
Were.
Have been.
Before.
I'll watch your back.
It's me front I'm worried about.
Mind the boat.
Mind the boat.
Mind the boat.
Mind the boat.
Mind the boat.
Jack Sparrow.
Tia Dalma.
I always know the wind was going blow
you back to me one day.
You.
You have a touch of destiny about you,
William Turner.
You know me?
You want to know me.
There'll be no knowing here.
We've come for help
and we're not leaving without it.
I thought I knew you.
Not so well as I had hoped. Come.
Come.
What service may I do you?
You know I demand payment.
I brought payment.
Look.
An undead monkey.
Top that.
No.
You've no idea how long it took us
to catch that.
The payment is fair.
We're looking for this.
And what it goes to.
The compass you bartered from me,
it cannot lead you to this?
Maybe.
Why?
Aye.
Jack Sparrow does not know
what he wants.
Or do you know,
but are loathe to claim it as your own.
Your key go to a chest
and it is what lay inside the chest
you seek, don't it?
What is inside?
Gold? Jewels?
Unclaimed properties
of a valuable nature?
Nothing bad, I hope.
You know of Davy Jones, yes?
A man of the sea.
A great sailor until he ran afoul of that
which vex all men.
What vexes all men?
What indeed.
The sea?
Sums.
The dichotomy of good and evil.
A woman.
A woman. He fell in love.
No, no, no. I heard it was the sea
he fell in love with.
Same story, different versions,
and all are true.
See, it was a woman, as changing,
and harsh, and untameable as the sea.
Him never stopped loving her.
But the pain it cause him
was too much to live with.
But not enough to cause him to die.
What exactly did he put into the chest?
Him heart.
Literally or figuratively?
He couldn't literally put his heart
in a chest.
Could he?
It was not worth feeling
what small fleeting joy life brings.
And so him carved out him heart,
lock it away in a chest,
and hide the chest from the world.
The key,
he keep with him at all times.
You knew this.
I did not.
I didn't know where the key was.
But now we do.
So all that's left is to climb aboard
the Flying Dutchman,
grab the key, you go back to Port Royal,
and save your bonnie lass, eh?
Let me see your hand.
The black spot.
Black spot.
Black spot.
My eyesight's as good as ever,
just so you know.
I have just the thing.
Now, where did I put it'?
Must be here somewhere.
My little beauty, where are you?
It's been such a long time
in such a mess.
Davy Jones cannot make port.
Cannot step on land,
but once every ten years.
Land is where you are safe,
Jack Sparrow.
And so you will carry land with you.
Dirt.
This is a jar of dirt.
Yes?
Is the jar of dirt going to help?
If you don't want it, give it back.
No.
Then it helps.
It seems we have a need
to find the Flying Dutchman.
A touch of destiny.
That's the Flying Dutchman? 
She doesn't look like much.
Neither do you.
Do not underestimate her.
Must have run afoul of the reef.
So, what's your plan, then?
I row over, search the ship
until I find your bloody key.
And if there are crewmen?
I cut down anyone in my path.
I like it. Simple, easy to remember.
Your chariot awaits you, sire!
If you do happen to get captured,
just say Jack Sparrow sent you
to settle his debt.
Might save your life.
Bon voyage!
Douse the lamps.
Hoist jib. Bring up with a round turn.
Captain's orders.
Sailor.
Hoist the innerjib. Captain's orders.
Sailor!
Hoisting the jib.
Bring up a round turn.
There's no use. You've run aground.
No.
Beneath us.
Foul breath.
Hey! Hey!
Down on your marrowbones and pray.
Get back!
Back!
Five men still alive.
The rest have moved on.
Do you fear death?
Do you fear that dark abyss?
All your deeds laid bare.
All your sins punished.
I can offer you an escape.
Don't listen to him!
Do you not fear death?
I'll take my chances, sir.
To the depths.
Cruel blackguard!
Life is cruel.
Why should the afterlife
be any different?
I offer you a choice.
Join my crew
and postpone the judgment.
One hundred years before the mast.
Will ye serve?
I will serve.
There.
You are neither dead nor dying.
What is your purpose here?
Jack Sparrow sent me
to settle his debt.
What is your purpose here?
Jack Sparrow sent me
to settle his debt.
Did he, now?
I'm sorely tempted to accept that offer.
You have a debt to pay.
You've been captain of the Black Pearl 
for 13 years.
That was our agreement.
Technically I was only captain
for two years,
then I was viciously mutinied upon.
Then you were a poor captain,
but a captain nonetheless.
Have you not introduced yourself
all these years as Captain Jack Sparrow?
You have my payment. One soul to serve
on your ship. He's already over there.
One soul is not equal to another.
We've established my proposal
is sound in principle.
Now we're just haggling over price.
Price?
Just how many souls
do you think my soul is worth?
One hundred souls.
Three days.
You're a diamond, mate.
Send me back the boy.
I'll get started right off.
I keep the boy. A goodfaith payment.
That leaves you only 99 more to go.
Have you not met Will Turner?
He's noble, heroic, terrific soprano.
Worth at least four.
Maybe three and a half.
And did I happen to mention...
he's in love'?
With a girl.
Due to be married.
Betroth ed.
Dividing him from her and her from him
would only be half as cruel
as actually allowing them
to be joined in holy matrimony, eh'?
I keep the boy. Ninetynine souls.
But I wonder, Sparrow,
can you live with this?
Can you condemn an innocent man,
a friend,
to a lifetime of servitude in your name
while you roam free?
Yep. I'm good with it.
Shall we seal it in blood? I mean, ink?
Three days.
Three days.
Mr. Gibbs.
Aye.
I feel sullied and unusual.
And how do you intend to harvest
these 99 souls in three days?
Fortunately,
he was mum as to the condition
in which these souls need be.
Tortuga.
Tortuga.
It's an outrage.
Port tariffs, berthing fees, wharf handling
and, heaven help us, pilotage.
Are we all to work
for the East India Trading Company, then?
I'm afraid, sir, Tortuga is the only free port
left in these waters.
A pirate port is what you mean.
Well, I'm sorry.
An honest sailor is what I am.
I make my living fair
and I sleep well each night, thank you.
Sir.
She wants you to do something.
She's trying to give a sign.
Over there. Look for a sign.
Look, there. There it is.
There's the sign.
That's seaweed.
Seaweed can be a sign.
Looks like entrails.
That would be a bad sign.
What's that over there?
Have mercy, will you?
And what makes you think
you're worthy to crew the Black Pearl? 
Truth be told,
I've never sailed a day in me life.
I figure I should get out, see the world
while I'm still young.
You'll do. Make your mark.
Next.
My wife ran off with my dog
and I'm drunk for a month
and I don't give an ass rat's
if I live or die.
Perfect. Next.
I know what I want. I know what I want.
Me have one arm and a bum leg.
It's the crow's nest for you.
I know what I want.
Next.
Ever since I was a little lad,
I've always wanted
to sail the seas. Forever.
Sooner than you think. Sign the roster.
Thanks very much.
How we going?
Including those four, that gives us four.
And what's your story?
My story
It's exactly the same as your story,
just one chapter behind.
I chased a man across the seven seas.
The pursuit cost me my crew,
my commission,
and my life.
Commodore?
No, not any more. Weren't you listening?
I nearly had you all off Tripoli.
I would have,
if not for the hurricane.
Lord. You didn't try to sail through it.
So do I make your crew or not?
You haven't said where you're going.
Somewhere nice?
So am I worthy to serve
under Captain Jack Sparrow?
Or should I just kill you now?
You're hired.
Sorry.
Old habits and all that.
Easy, sailor!
That's our captain you're threatening.
Time to go.
Aye.
Thanks, mate.
Carry on.
Come on, then.
Who wants some?
Form an orderly line.
I'll have you all, one by one.
Come on, who's first?
I just wanted the pleasure
of doing that myself.
I've never liked him.
James Norrington.
What has the world done to you?
Heave!
Heave!
Heave!
Heave!
Heaveho!
Secure the mast tackle, Mr. Turner.
Get to it!
Step aside.
Hey, mind yourself.
Hey!
Let go, boy.
No.
Haul that weevil to his feet.
Five lashes to remind you to stay on her.
No.
Impeding me in my duties?
You'll share the punishment.
I'll take it all.
Will you now?
And what would prompt
such an act of charity?
My son.
He's my son.
What fortuitous circumstance be this.
Five lashes be owed, I believe it is.
No. No, I won't.
The cat's out of the bag, Mr. Turner.
Your issue will feel its sting,
be it by the boatswain's hand or your own.
No, no.
Boatswain!
No!
You had it easy, boy.
William.
I don't need your help.
The boatswain prides himself
on cleaving flesh from bone
with every swing.
So I'm to understand what you did
was an act of compassion.
Yes.
One hundred years before the mast,
losing your world bit by bit,
until you end up like poor Wyvern here.
Once you've sworn an oath
to the Dutchman, there's no leaving it.
Not until your debt is paid.
I've sworn no oath.
Then you must get away.
Not until I find this.
The key.
The dead man's chest.
What do you know of this?
Open the chest with the key
and stab the heart.
No, no, no. Don't stab the heart.
The Dutchman needs a living heart
or there'll be no captain.
And if there's no captain,
there's no one to have the key.
So the captain has the key?
Where is the key?
Hidden.
Where is the chest?
Hidden.
Captain Sparrow.
Come to join me crew, lad?
Welcome aboard.
I'm here to find the man I love.
I'm deeply flattered, son,
but my first and only love is the sea.
Meaning William Turner,
Captain Sparrow.
Elizabeth.
Hide the rum.
You know, these clothes do not flatter you
at all. It should be a dress or nothing.
I happen to have no dress in my cabin.
Jack.
I know Will came to find you.
Where is he?
Darling, I am truly unhappy
to have to tell you this,
but through an unfortunate and entirely
unforeseeable series of circumstances
that have nothing whatsoever
to do with me,
poor Will has been pressganged
into Davy Jones' crew.
Davy Jones?
Oh, please.
The captain of the Flying Dutchman? 
You look bloody awful.
What are you doing here?
You hired me.
I can't help it if your standards are lax.
You smell funny.
Jack.
All I want is to find Will.
Are you certain?
Is that what you really want most?
Of course.
Because I would think, you'd want
to find a way to save Will the most.
And you'd have a way of doing that?
Well, there is a chest.
Oh, dear.
A chest of unknown size and origin.
What contains the stillbeating heart
of Davy Jones.
Yeah.
And whoever possesses that chest
possesses the leverage
to command Jones
to do whatever it is he or she wants,
including saving brave William
from his grim fate.
You don't actually believe him, do you?
How do we find it?
With this.
My compass is unique.
Unique here
having the meaning of broken.
True enough.
This compass does not point north.
Where does it point?
It points to the thing
you want most in this world.
Oh, Jack.
Are you telling the truth?
Every word, love.
And what you want most in this world
is to find the chest of Davy Jones,
is it not?
To save Will?
By finding the chest of Davy Jones.
Mr. Gibbs!
Captain.
We have our heading.
Finally.
Cast off those lines, weigh anchor
and crowd that canvas!
Miss Swann.
Come on, lads! Make on deck, will you?
Time to go now, eh.
Welcome to the crew,
former commodore.
Right. I remember that.
There's something to knowing
the exact shape of the world
and one's place in it, don't you agree?
I assure you these are not necessary.
I had you brought here
because I thought you'd be interested
in the whereabouts of your daughter.
You have news of her?
Most recently seen
on the island of Tortuga
then left in the company of a known pirate,
Jack Sparrow,
and other fugitives from justice.
Justice. Hardly.
Including the previous owner
of this sword, I believe.
Our ships are in pursuit
and justice will be dispensed
by cannonade and cutlass
and all manner
of remorseless pieces of metal.
I personally find it distasteful
to even contemplate the horror
facing all those on board.
What do you want from me?
Your authority as governor,
your influence in London,
and your loyalty
to the East India Trading Company.
To you, you mean.
Shall I remove these shackles?
Do what you can for my daughter.
So you see, Mercer,
every man has a price
he will willingly accept,
even for what he hopes never to sell.
I wager ten years.
I'll match ten years.
Agreed.
Four fours.
Wondering how it's played?
I understand.
Liar!
It's a game of deception.
But your bet includes all the dice
not just your own.
What are they wagering?
Oh, the only thing we have.
Years of service.
So any crewmember can be challenged?
Aye, anyone.
I challenge Davy Jones.
I accept that.
The stakes?
My soul.
An eternity of servitude.
No.
Against?
I want this.
How do you know of the key?
That's not part of the game, is it?
You can still walk away.
What's this?
I'm in. Matching his wager.
No!
Don't do this.
The die is cast.
I bet three twos.
It's your bid, captain.
Four fours.
Four fives
Six threes.
Seven fives.
Eight fives.
Welcome to the crew, lad.
Twelve fives.
Twelve fives.
Call me a liar or up the bid.
And be called a liar myself
for my trouble?
Bootstrap Bill, you're a liar
and you will spend an eternity on this ship!
Master Turner, feel free to go ashore
the very next time we make port.
Fool.
Why did you do that?
I couldn't let you lose.
It was never about winning or losing.
The key.
You just wanted to know where it was.
Captain says I'm to relieve you.
Captain's orders.
Here. Take this too.
Now, get yourself to land,
and stay there.
It was always in my blood to die at sea.
It was not a fate I ever wanted for you.
It's not a fate you had to choose
for yourself, either.
Aye.
I could say I did what I had to,
when I left you to go pirating.
But it would taste a lie
to say it wasn't what I wanted.
You owe me nothing, Will.
Now go.
They'll know you helped me.
What more can they do to me?
I take this with a promise.
I'll find a way
to sever Jones's hold on you,
and not rest
until this blade pierces his heart.
I will not abandon you.
I promise.
Beckett?
Yes, they're signed.
Lord Cutler Beckett
of the East India Trading Company.
Will was working for Beckett
and never said a word.
Beckett wants the compass.
Only one reason for that.
Of course.
He wants the chest.
Yes, he did say something
about a chest.
If the company controls the chest,
they controls the sea.
A truly discomfiting notion, love.
And bad.
Bad for every mother's son
what calls himself a pirate.
I think there's a bit more speed
to be coaxed from these sails.
Brace the foreyard!
Might I enquire
as to how you came by these?
Persuasion.
Friendly?
Decidedly not.
Will strikes a deal for these
and upholds it with honour,
yet you are the one standing here
with the prize.
"Full pardon.
Commission as a privateer
on behalf of England
and the East India Trading Company."
As if I could be bought
for such a low price.
Jack, the letters, give them back.
No. Persuade me.
You do know Will taught me
how to handle a sword?
As I said, persuade me.
It's a curious thing.
There was a time
when I would have given anything
for you to look like that
while thinking about me.
I don't know what you mean.
Oh, I think you do.
Oh, don't be absurd.
I trust him, that's all.
So you never wondered
how your latest fianc√©
ended up on the Flying Dutchman
in the first place? 
Strange thing to come upon a longboat
so far out in open waters.
Just put as many leagues behind us
as you can. As fast as you can.
And what are we running from'?
That dress. Where did you get it?
It was found aboard the ship.
The crew thought it was a spirit
bringing some omen of illfate.
That's foolish.
Oh, yes. Exceedingly foolish.
It brought good fortune.
The spirit told us, "Pull in at Tortuga",
and we made a nice bit of profit there.
Off the books, of course.
I imagine some of your crew
may have jumped ship there.
Why do you ask?
Captain, a ship's been spotted.
Colours?
She isn't flying any.
Pirates.
Or worse.
You will watch this.
Let no joyful voice be heard.
Let no man look up at the sky
with hope.
And let this day be cursed
by we who ready to wake...
the Kraken.
No!
What kind of ship?
What is it?
Starboard.
I've doomed us all.
It's the Flying Dutchman!
Oh, Mother Carey's chickens!
What happened?
Must have hit a reef.
Free the rudder!
Hard to port then harder starboard!
Free the rudder!
Hard to port!
Kraken!
Kraken!
To arms!
To arms!
Now!
Take up the axe!
Here it is! Take it!
Take it!
Kraken!
Go!
The boy's not here.
He must have been claimed by the sea.
I am the sea.
You need time alone
with your thoughts. Brig!
What of the survivors?
There are no survivors.
The chest is no longer safe.
Chart a course to Isla Cruces.
Get me there first
or there'll be the devil to pay.
First?
Who sent that thieving charlatan
onto my ship?
Who told them of the key?
Jack Sparrow.
My tremendous intuitive sense
of the female creature
informs me that you are troubled.
I just thought I'd be married by now.
I'm so ready to be married.
You know,
Lizzie,
I am captain of a ship.
And being captain of a ship, I could,
in fact, perform a marriage,
right here,
right on this deck,
right now.
No, thank you.
Why not?
We are very much alike, you and I.
I and you. Us.
Oh, except for a sense of honour
and a decency and a moral centre.
And personal hygiene.
Trifles
You will come over to my side,
I know it.
You seem very certain.
One word, love: curiosity.
You long for freedom.
You long to do what you want to do
because you want it.
To act on selfish impulse.
You want to see what it's like.
One day,
you won't be able to resist.
Why doesn't your compass work?
My compass works fine.
Because you and I are alike.
And there will come a moment
when you have the chance to show it.
To do the right thing.
I love those moments.
I like to wave at them as they pass by.
You'll have the chance
to do something__ Something courageous.
And when you do,
you'll discover something.
That you're a good man.
All evidence to the contrary.
Oh, I have faith in you.
Want to know why?
Do tell, dearie.
Curiosity.
You're going to want it.
A chance to be admired
and gain the rewards that follow.
You won't be able to resist.
You're going to want to know
what it tastes like.
I do want to know what it tastes like.
But seeing as you're a good man,
I know that you'd never put me
in a position
that would compromise my honour.
I'm proud of you, Jack.
Land, ho!
I want my jar of dirt.
You're pulling too fast.
You're pulling too slow.
We don't want the Kraken to catch us.
I'm saving me strength
for when it comes.
And I don't think it's Kraken, anyways.
I always heard it said Krayken.
What, with a long A?
No, no, no. Krahken's how it's pronounced
in the original Scandinavian
and Kraken's closer to that.
Well, we ain't original Scandinavians,
are we?
Krayken.
It's a mythological creature,
I can calls it what I wants.
Guard the boat, mind the tide.
Don't touch my dirt.
This doesn't work.
And it certainly doesn't show you
what you want most.
Yes, it does.
You're sitting on it.
Beg pardon?
Move.
"Guard the boat. Mind the tide."
I could join the circus.
"Don't mind if I shine your shoes, sir."
They're here.
And I cannot step foot on land again
for near of a decade.
You'll trust us to act in your stead?
I'll trust you to know what awaits you
should you fail!
Down, then!
Down!
Down!
Down!
It's real.
You actually were telling the truth.
I do that quite a lot.
Yet people are always surprised.
With good reason.
Will.
You're all right. Thank God.
I came to find you.
How did you get here?
Sea turtles, mate,
a pair of them strapped to my feet.
Not so easy, is it?
But I do owe you thanks, Jack.
You do?
After you tricked me onto that ship
to square your debt with Jones...
What?
What?
...I was reunited with my father.
Oh, well, you're welcome, then.
Everything you said to me,
every word was a lie!
Pretty much. Time and tide, love.
What are you doing?
I'm gonna kill Jones.
Can't let you do that, William.
Because if Jones is dead,
who's to call his terrible beastie
off the hunt, eh?
Now, if you please.
The key.
I keep the promises I make, Jack.
I intend to free my father.
I hope you're here to see it.
I can't let you do that either.
So sorry.
I knew you'd warm up to me eventually.
Lord Beckett desires the contents
of that chest.
I deliver it, I get my life back.
The dark side of ambition.
Oh, I prefer to see it
as the promise of redemption.
Stop it!
Be careful!
Will!
Guard the chest.
No!
This is barbaric!
This is no way for grown men to settle__
Oh, fine!
Let's just pull out our swords
and start banging away at each other!
That will solve everything!
I've had it! I've had it with wobblylegged,
rumsoaked pirates!
And how'd this go all screwy?
Enough!
Well,
each wants the chest for hisself,
don%he?
Mr. Norrington, I think,
he's trying regain a bit of honour.
Old Jack's looking to trade it,
save his own skin.
And Turner there,
I figure he's trying to settle
some unresolved business 'twixt him
and his twicecursed pirate father.
Sad.
This is madness!
That chest must be worth more
than a shiny penny.
Oh, terrible temptation.
If we was any kind of decent,
we'd remove temptation from their path.
Enough!
Oh, the heat!
Bugger
By your leave, Mr. Turner.
By your leave, Mr. Norrington.
Do excuse me while I kill the man
who ruined my life.
Be my guest.
Let us examine that claim for a moment,
former commodore, shall we?
Who was it, that at the very moment
you had a notorious pirate
safely behind bars,
saw fit to free said pirate
and take your dearly beloved
all to hisself, eh?
So who's fault is it really
that you've ended up a rumpot deck hand
what takes orders from pirates?
Enough!
Unfortunately, Mr. Turner, he's right!
Still rooting for you, mate.
We got it. We got it.
We got it.
Hello, poppet.
Come on, run!
Sword!
Sword! Sword!
Sword!
Follow my voice. Follow my voice.
To the left. No, turn around.
Go to the right. Go__
No, that's a tree.
Oh, shut it.
It's over there.
Jack!
You have it.
Yeah.
Jar of dirt.
Right.
We'll hang on to that.
Come on.
We've got it.
All right.
Come along, Turner!
Leave him alone! Unless you plan
on using him to hit something with.
We're not getting out of this.
Not with the chest. Into the boat.
You're mad.
Don't wait for me.
I say we respect his final wish.
Aye!
Your bravery is wasted.
I shall pry the chest away
from your cold, dead hands.
Here you go.
Pirates.
Hey!
What happened to the chest?
Norrington took it to draw them off.
You're pulling too hard!
You ain't pulling hard enough!
Where's the commodore?
Fell behind.
My prayers be with him.
Best not wallow in our grief.
The bright side is you're back
and made it off free and clear.
Lord on high, deliver us.
I'll handle this, mate.
Fish face.
Lose something? Hey, scungilli.
Got it.
Come to negotiate, eh,
have you, you slimy git?
Look what I got.
I got a jar of dirt
I got a jar of dirt 
And guess what's inside it 
Enough.
Hard to starboard.
Hard to starboard!
Brace up the foreyard!
Hard to starboard!
Send his beloved Pearl 
back to the depths.
Fire!
She's on us! She's on us!
Let them taste the triple guns.
Aye, captain.
Make fast!
Go on, me darling.
Show us what you've got.
Come on, girl!
She's falling behind.
Aye, we've got her.
We're the faster?
Against the wind the Dutchman beats us,
that's how she takes her prey.
But with the wind...
We rob her advantage.
They're out of range!
Break off pursuit, run out light
and douse canvas.
We giving up, sir?
They're giving up!
My father is on that ship.
If we can outrun her, we can take her.
We should turn and fight.
Why fight when you can negotiate?
All one needs is the proper leverage.
Where is it?
Where is the thumpthump?
We must have hit the reef!
No. It's not a reef!
Get away from the rail!
What is it?
The Kraken.
To arms!
All guns, defend the masts!
It'll attack the starboard.
I've seen it before!
Run out the cannons
and hold for my signal.
Come on! Come on!
Easy, boys!
Will?
Steady. Steady.
Will?
Hold. Hold.
I think we've held fire long enough.
Will?
Fire!
No!
It'll be back.
We have to get off the ship.
There's no boats.
Pull the grates. Get all the gunpowder
onto the net in the cargo hold!
Whatever you do, don't miss.
As soon as you're clear.
We are short stocked on gunpowder.
Six barrel.
Hurry UP!
There's only half a dozen
kegs of powder.
Then load the rum.
Aye, the rum too!
Step to.
Oh, you coward.
Not good.
Haul away!
Heave!
Heave like you're being paid for it!
Put your backs into it!
Pull it away!
Come on, you can do it!
I got you! I got you!
Don't let me go!
I won't let you go!
Shoot me!
Here!
Here! Come on!
Here! Come on!
Come and get me. I'm over here!
Come on!
Shoot!
Elizabeth, shoot!
Did We kill it?
No. We just made it angry.
We're not out of this yet.
Captain, orders!
Abandon ship. Into the longboat.
Jack.
The Pearl. 
She's only a ship, mate.
He's right. We have to head for land.
It's a lot of open water.
It's a lot of water.
We have to try.
We can get away
as it takes down the Pearl.
Abandon ship.
Abandon ship or abandon hope.
Thank you, Jack.
We're not free yet, love.
You came back.
I always knew you were a good man.
Prepare to cast off.
There's no time to lose.
Come on, Will. Step to!
It's after you, not the ship.
It's not us.
This is the only way, don't you see?
I'm not sorry.
Pirate.
Where's Jack?
He elected to stay behind
to give us a chance.
Go!
Bugger, bugger, bugger!
Come on.
Just got it. Come on.
Not so bad.
Hello, beastie.
Jack Sparrow, our debt is settled.
The captain goes down with the ship.
Turns out not even Jack Sparrow
can best the devil.
Open the chest.
Open the chest. I need to see it!
Damn you, Jack Sparrow!
The last of our ships is returned.
Is there any news on the chest?
None.
But one of the ships
did pick up a man adrift at sea.
He had these.
I took the liberty of filling in my name.
If you intend to claim these,
then you must have something to trade.
Do you have the compass?
Better.
The heart of Davy Jones.
Against the cold and the sorrow.
It's a shame.
I know you're thinking
that with the Pearl 
you could have captured the devil
and set free your father's soul.
Doesn't matter now.
The Pearl is gone,
along with its captain.
Aye.
And already the world
seems a bit less bright.
He fooled us all right till the end,
but I guess that honest streak
finally won out.
To Jack Sparrow.
Never another like Captain Jack.
He was a gentleman of fortune, he was.
He was a good man.
If there was anything could be done
to bring him back...
Elizabeth.
Would you do it?
What would you?
What would any of you be willing to do?
Would you sail to the ends of the Earth
and beyond
to fetch back witty Jack
and him precious Pearl? 
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.
Yes.
Aye.
All right.
But if you go and brave the weird
and haunted shores at world's end
then you will need a captain
who knows those waters.
So tell me, what's become of my ship?
